H. C. FOLSOM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the age of nineteen years, I landed on the banks of the Upper\r\nMississippi, pitching my tent at Prairie du Chien, then (1836) a\r\nmilitary post known as Fort Crawford. I kept memoranda of my various\r\nchanges, and of many of the events transpiring. Subsequently, not,\r\nhowever, with any intention of publishing them in book form until\r\n1876, when, reflecting that fifty years spent amidst the early and\r\nfirst white settlements, and continuing till the period of\r\ncivilization and prosperity, itemized by an observer and participant\r\nin the stirring scenes and incidents depicted, might furnish material\r\nfor an interesting volume, valuable to those who should come after me,\r\nI concluded to gather up the items and compile them in a convenient\r\nform.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of interest to personal friends, and as also tending to\r\nthrow additional light upon my relation to the events here narrated, I\r\nhave prefixed an account of my own early life for the nineteen years\r\npreceding my removal to the West, thus giving to the work a somewhat\r\nautobiographical form. It may be claimed that a work thus written in\r\nthe form of a life history of a single individual, with observations\r\nfrom his own personal standpoint, will be more connected, clear and\r\nsystematic in its narration of events than if it were written\r\nimpersonally.\r\n\r\nThe period included in these sketches is one of remarkable\r\ntransitions, and, reaching backward, in the liberty accorded to the\r\nhistorian, to the time of the first explorations by the Jesuits, the\r\nfirst English, French and American traders, is a period of\r\ntransformation and progress that has been paralleled only on the\r\nshores of the New World. We have the transition from barbarism to\r\ncivilization; we have the subjugation of the wilderness by the first\r\nsettlers; the organization of territorial and state governments; an\r\nera of progress from the rude habits of the pioneer and trapper, to\r\nthe culture and refinement of civilized states; from the wilderness,\r\nyet unmapped, and traversed only by the hardy pioneer in birch barks\r\nor dog sledges, to the cultivated fields, cobwebbed by railways and\r\nstreams furrowed by steamers. It is something to have witnessed a\r\npart, even, of this wonderful transformation, and it is a privilege\r\nand a pleasure to record, even in part, its history.\r\n\r\nI have quoted from the most correct histories within my reach, but the\r\ngreater part of my work, or of that pertaining to the fifty years just\r\npassed, has been written from personal observation and from\r\ninformation obtained directly by interview with, or by written\r\ncommunications from, persons identified in some way with the history\r\nof the country. To those persons who have so freely and generously\r\nassisted me in the collection of material for this work, I hereby\r\nexpress my thanks. I have relied sparingly on traditions, and, where I\r\nhave used them, have referred to them as such.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile genealogical tables are of interest chiefly to the families and\r\nindividuals whose names are therein preserved, I still deem it not\r\namiss to insert here a brief account of my ancestry. Among the\r\nemigrants from England to the New World in 1638, came John Foulsham,\r\nthen twenty-three or twenty-four years of age, and his wife, to whom\r\nhe had been married about a year and a half. They came from Hingham,\r\nEngland, to Hingham, Mass., with a colony that probably named the\r\nsettlement in loving remembrance of the town they had left. They came\r\non account of certain ecclesiastical troubles; their rector, with whom\r\nthey sympathized, having torn down the altar rails and leveled the\r\naltar, an act of irreverence that called down upon them the wrath of\r\ntheir superior, Bishop Wren, and resulted in rector and people selling\r\nout their real estate at half its value and emigrating to America.\r\nJohn received a grant of land consisting of four acres and built\r\nhimself a house, the frame being constructed of sawed oak timber. This\r\nhouse, built in 1640, stood until 1875, two hundred and thirty-five\r\nyears, when it was taken down and manufactured into canes and chairs,\r\nwhich were distributed as relics to the American descendants of the\r\nfamily. The family, however, had increased so greatly that the supply\r\nwas not equal to the demand.\r\n\r\nThe wife of John Foulsham was Mary Gilman. From this couple the\r\nAmerican Folsoms and their allies from marriages with the female\r\ndescendants of the family have sprung. The ancestors of John Foulsham\r\nmay be traced backward a period of near six hundred years, and many of\r\nthe family have honorable mention in English history. The earliest\r\nmention is concerning John Foulsham of Foulsham, prior of a Carmelite\r\nmonastery in Norwich, and \"præses provincialis\" of all England. This\r\nFoulsham is spoken of in Bayle's catalogue of eminent worthies as \"no\r\nmean proficient in controversial theology, knowing how, by means of\r\nsyllogystic tricks, to turn white into black and men into donkeys.\" He\r\ndied in the great plague at Norwich in 1348.\r\n\r\nA certain John de Foulsham is spoken of in Blomefield's History of\r\nNorfolk as an \"eloquent, unflinching opponent of the corruptions of\r\nthe times.\" It is possible that this may be the Carmelite prior above\r\nmentioned, though the prefix _de_ leaves the matter somewhat in doubt.\r\n\r\nAs to the original derivation of the family name, Hon. George Folsom,\r\nof Philadelphia, in one of the manuscripts left by him, says: \"It\r\narose upon the adoption of surnames in England, from the town of\r\nFoulsham, a village in the county of Norfolk, six or eight miles north\r\nof Hingham, in which county the family was seated for many centuries,\r\npossessing estates in fifteen different places.\" Thus John de, or John\r\nof Foulsham, became John Foulsham.\r\n\r\nThe orthography and pronunciation of the name have varied in the\r\nfamily itself, as well as among those writing and pronouncing it. The\r\nfirst Anglo-American bearing the name spelled it \"Foulsham.\" His son,\r\nDeacon John, spelled it \"Fullsam\" in 1709, and it is signed \"Foullsam\"\r\nin his last will--1715. In one instance, in the Hingham town records,\r\nit is spelled \"Fulsham,\" but always afterward, \"Foulsham.\" In the\r\nExeter records it is written uniformly \"Folsom\" with but one\r\nexception, when it is written by the town clerk \"Foulshame.\" In the\r\nrecords of the first parish, Haverhill, Massachusetts, it is written\r\n\"Foulsham,\" \"Foulsam,\" \"Folsham\" and \"Fulsom.\" Originally it was\r\ndoubtless spelled \"Foulshame,\" its etymological significance being the\r\n_fowls' home_, a breeding place or mart. It was probably at first\r\nwritten with a hyphen, as Fouls-hame, but the final syllable was\r\neventually shortened. Everywhere it is now written _Folsom_ by those\r\nhaving the name, and is pronounced like _wholesome_.\r\n\r\nThe characteristics of the family have been quite uniform. Far as\r\nknown they were a religious family, and prominent as such in both\r\nCatholic and Protestant circles, with a strong disposition toward\r\ndissent from the established order of things. Thus John de Foulsham\r\nwrote a treatise quite at variance with the doctrines of the church,\r\nadvocating the marriage of priests. John Foulsham, the Anglo-American,\r\nleft England on account of his dissent, preferring a home in the\r\nwilderness with freedom to worship God, to dwelling under the rule of\r\na haughty and tyrannical bishop. Many of the family espoused the\r\ndoctrines of Whitfield. Many of them became Baptists, becoming such at\r\na time when the Baptists were most unpopular, and afterward becoming\r\nFree Will Baptists, in which communion more of the family may to-day\r\nbe found than in any other.\r\n\r\nThe occupations of the family were mostly, in the early days,\r\nmechanical. Many were joiners and millwrights. The children and\r\ngrandchildren were farmers, landholders and lumbermen. Of the many who\r\nremoved to Maine, after the Revolution, most engaged in lumbering, but\r\nturned their attention also to milling and storekeeping.\r\n\r\nThe family have also shown a military tendency, and during the various\r\nwars visited upon the country since the early colonial times, this\r\nfamily has borne its full share of the dangers, toils and expense.\r\n\r\nMy father, Jeremiah Folsom, was born in Tamworth, New Hampshire, Sept.\r\n16, 1780, and was married to Octavia Howe, April 5, 1805. My mother\r\nwas born in Machias, Maine, Oct. 12, 1786. My father was a prominent\r\nbusiness man, and was engaged in shipping and mercantile pursuits, he\r\nowning vessels that plied from St. Johns to Machias and other American\r\nports. To facilitate his business, St. Johns was his home four years,\r\nduring which time he was associated with William Henry Carman. This\r\ntemporary residence and business association account for my being born\r\non British soil, and for the names by which I was christened.\r\nAccording to the record in the old family Bible, I was born at St.\r\nJohns, New Brunswick, June 22, 1817. When I was six months old my\r\nparents moved to Bangor, Maine, thence to Foxcroft, Maine, thence to\r\nAscot, Lower Canada.\r\n\r\nWhen I was five years old my parents moved to Tamworth, New Hampshire.\r\nYoung as I was, I am still able to recall events that occurred while I\r\nlived in Canada. I remember falling into a well and being badly\r\nbruised. I remember also an adventure with a bear. My parents had gone\r\nto church, leaving me at home, greatly against my will. I attempted to\r\nfollow, but missed the road and wandered off into a wood, perhaps\r\nthree miles away. When my parents returned they were much alarmed,\r\nand parties immediately went in pursuit. When I knew I was lost I set\r\nup a vigorous screaming, which had the effect of attracting attention\r\nfrom two very different parties. The first was a huge bear in quest of\r\nfood, and doubtless delighted at the prospect before him. The second\r\nwas one of the rescuing parties in quest of the lost boy. Both\r\nsimultaneously approached the screaming youngster and Bruin fought\r\nstubbornly for his prey, but was vanquished by the clubs of my\r\nrescuers, and I was carried home in triumph. I do not clearly recall\r\nall the incidents of this scene, and, strangely enough, do not\r\nremember seeing the bear. Perhaps the terror of being lost drove out\r\nevery other impression. An excuse for the narration of this apparently\r\ntrifling incident may be found in the fact that but for the prompt\r\narrival of the rescuing party, this history would never have been\r\nwritten.\r\n\r\nWhen I was ten years of age my parents removed to Bloomfield, Maine.\r\nWhile in Tamworth I had excellent opportunities of attending school,\r\nwhich I improved to the utmost. After leaving Tamworth my school\r\nprivileges were well nigh ended, as I never received from that time\r\nmore than six months' schooling. My father followed lumbering on the\r\nKennebec river. During the first winter in Maine, he took me to the\r\nlogging camp as camp boy. During the second winter he hired me to\r\nMatthew and Lewis Dunbar as a cook for their wood camp. I cooked for\r\nsix men and received five dollars a month. I was used very kindly by\r\nthe Dunbars, but that winter in the woods seemed a long, long winter.\r\nThe only book in camp was the Bible. There were, however, newspapers\r\nand playing cards. In the spring my father used the fifteen dollars\r\nreceived for my three months' work to purchase a cow. I served the\r\nDunbars the third winter, as cook, for six dollars a month, and worked\r\nthe ensuing summer on farms at about twenty-five cents per day. During\r\nthe fourth winter I worked for the Dunbars and Timothy Snow at seven\r\ndollars per month, and the summer following worked on a farm for\r\nBenjamin Cayford at seven dollars. Cayford was a merciless tyrant, and\r\nsometimes compelled his men to work in the field till nine o'clock at\r\nnight. These details of wages paid and work done, uninteresting in\r\nthemselves, serve to show the value of a boy's work (I was not yet\r\nfifteen) and what was expected of the average boy, for mine was no\r\nexceptional case nor was my father more exacting than others in his\r\nstation in life. He was in poor health, and had a large family of\r\nboys. We were eight in number, and of these I was one of the most\r\nrobust and able to assist in the support of the family.\r\n\r\nThis year I persuaded my father to sell me my time, which amounted to\r\nfive years, which he reluctantly did, accepting two hundred and fifty\r\ndollars as an equivalent. It was my ambition to go West. Horace\r\nGreeley had not uttered the talismanic words, \"Go West, young man,\"\r\nbut I believed that by going West I would be better able to advance my\r\nown interests and assist my parents. My father signed the necessary\r\npaper relinquishing my time, which was printed in the Skowhegan\r\n_Clarion_. From this time until I was nineteen years old I worked on\r\nthe river and on farms, worked continuously and beyond my strength. I\r\nworked another summer for Cayford, but have no pleasant recollections\r\nof him, for on his farm I was sadly overworked, being often called to\r\nwork before sunrise and kept at work after sunset. I worked two\r\nwinters cooking in the woods for Capt. Asa Steward, of Bloomfield, one\r\nof the best men I ever served, a kind hearted, honest Christian. He\r\ngave me good counsel and good wages besides. In the fall of 1835 I\r\nwent into the woods to work for Capt. Eb. Snow, of Madison. Like\r\nCayford, he was a merciless tyrant and abusive to his men. I left his\r\ncamp before my engagement closed, not being able to endure his abuse\r\nlonger. This is the only time in which I failed to keep a labor\r\nengagement. I finished the winter with Capt. Asa Steward, but my eyes\r\nbecame so inflamed from the smoke of the camp that I was obliged to\r\nabandon cooking.\r\n\r\nDuring this winter occurred an incident that came near having a\r\nserious and even fatal termination. There were three of us, Simeon\r\nGoodrich, Jimmie Able and myself, who went down the Kennebec to the\r\nForks, a distance of twelve miles from camp. A deep, damp snow had\r\nfallen the night previous, and through this snow, reaching above our\r\nknees, we trudged wearily till Able gave out. We carried him a short\r\ndistance, but becoming exhausted ourselves, laid him down in the snow.\r\nTo remain with him would be to imperil the lives of all; by hurrying\r\non we might be able to send a party to bring him in. We carefully\r\nmade for him a bed of fir boughs and placed loose garments over him\r\nand under him, and as he was sick, weak and faint, gave him a draught\r\nof liquid opodeldoc, and leaving the bottle with him, hurried on. We\r\ntraveled the last mile through an opening. Snow drifted deeply. We\r\ndragged our bodies through the drifts in the direction of a glimmering\r\nlight, which proved to be Sturgis' hotel, which we reached at 11\r\no'clock P. M. A team was sent back immediately for the lost Able by a\r\nroad of which we knew nothing. The rescuing party met him trudging\r\nalong with all his baggage. The opodeldoc had revived him, and he had\r\ntraveled a full mile when he met the rescuing party. At two o'clock\r\nthe team returned bringing the lost wayfarer.\r\n\r\nAnother adventure terminated more disastrously than this. In the\r\nspring of 1835 I was employed in taking logs across Moosehead lake.\r\nThe logs were in booms, and were moved by a capstan and rope. This was\r\nbefore the days of steamboats, and the moving of the booms was no\r\nlight task. On this occasion a gale of wind struck us and drifted us\r\nacross the lake. We threw out an anchor, hoping to check the course of\r\nthe boom and swing it into Cowan's bay. In one of our throws the\r\nanchor tripped, or caught fast, and suddenly tightened the line. Our\r\nwhole crew were in an instant hurled headlong. Some were thrown into\r\nthe water. One man (Butler) had his ribs broken. All were more or less\r\ninjured. The capstan went overboard. The old boom swung on and on,\r\nand, passing Spencer's bay, broke and went to pieces on the shore. The\r\nlogs were with great difficulty regathered, but were finally brought\r\nto the outlet of the lake July 4th, the last raft of the season.\r\n\r\nAfter river driving in the spring of 1835, I went to the Penobscot\r\nriver and found employment at twenty dollars a month at East Great\r\nWorks, building a dam. John Mills, our superintendent, was a good man.\r\nThere was a lyceum here, the first I ever attended. In December I\r\nreturned to the Kennebec, and in the spring of 1836 went to Dead river\r\nto drive, but an attack of the measles and general ill health, with\r\nsymptoms of pulmonary derangement, compelled me to abandon the work. I\r\nhad lived nine years on the Kennebec, years of hard labor and exertion\r\nbeyond my strength, and in that time had earned enough to pay my\r\nfather two hundred and fifty dollars. I had been able to purchase a\r\nsmall library, and had two hundred dollars in cash to defray my\r\nexpenses to the West.\r\n\r\nREMINISCENCES.--He that leaves the home of his youth for a strange\r\nland carries with him memories, pleasant to recall, of scenes and\r\nincidents, the influence of which he feels to the latest hour of life.\r\nThere are some things he can not forget. They may not be an essential\r\npart of his own life history, but still they have found a place in his\r\nmind and seem a part of himself, and he recurs to them again and again\r\nwith ever increasing delight. There are other things, may be, not so\r\npleasant to dwell upon, which still have a place in his memory and may\r\nbe profitably recalled. No one who has ever lived in Maine can forget\r\nits dark pine forests, its rugged hills, its rushing streams, cold and\r\nclear as crystal, its broad lakes, the abundant game of its forests\r\nand the fish in its waters. The Minnesota and Wisconsin pioneers, who\r\nwith the author of this book claim Maine as an early home, will not\r\nobject to the insertion in this chapter of a few of these\r\nreminiscences.\r\n\r\nMOOSEHEAD LAKE.--My first visit to Moosehead lake was in the early\r\nwinter of 1834. At that time it was still in the wilderness, only two\r\nsettlers having found their way to its shores. We were going with a\r\nsix ox team to a camp on the Brasua and our road led us across the\r\nfrozen lake. Emerging from a beech and maple grove on the margin near\r\nHaskell's, our sled plunged downward, and in a moment we found\r\nourselves on the gray ice of the lake, with a wonderful panorama\r\nspread out before us. The distant islands and the shores, hilly and\r\nmountainous, stood out plainly between the winter sky and the ice\r\ncovered lake. The mirage added its finishing touches to the picture,\r\nincreasing the brightness and apparent size of distant objects, or\r\nlending them brilliant hues, the whole scene sparkling in the frosty\r\nsunlit air, making a vision of beauty that could not fade. On we\r\ntrudged over the ice, the sled creaking, the ice emitting a roaring\r\nsound, not unlike the discharge of a park of artillery, sounds\r\nproduced by the expansion of the ice. We trudged on past islands and\r\ncraggy, rock-bound shores, passed Burnt Jacket, Squaw and Moxey\r\nmountains in the east, Lily and Spencer bays at the southeast, Misery\r\nand other mountains in the west, while far away to the north of east\r\ntowered white old Katahdin. Before us loomed up the flint rock Kinneo,\r\nits perpendicular face fronting west, on the lake; at the base a\r\nbeautiful maple interval extending toward Spencer bay.\r\n\r\nThe following spring our boom lay wind-bound at the base of Kinneo,\r\nand we seized the opportunity of climbing the vast pile of flinty\r\nrocks composing it, and obtained thence a view of unparalleled beauty,\r\nincluding the broad, bright lake, fairy islands, mountains and hills\r\nand vast stretches of pine forests. The tourist might seek far and\r\nwide, vainly, for a landscape rivaling this.\r\n\r\nMOOSE HUNTING.--The lake and surrounding country offer unrivaled\r\nattractions to the sportsman. The lake abounds in fish, of which the\r\nlake trout is the most abundant in number and delicious in flavor.\r\nSpecimens are frequently taken weighing from ten to fifteen pounds.\r\nThe forests at that time abounded in wild animals, chief of which was\r\nthe moose, the largest and the homeliest of the deer family. With his\r\nlong, narrow head, small eyes, donkey-like ears, pendant lips, the\r\nupper one curling like a small proboscis, with his high shoulders and\r\ngiraffe-like hips, with his short, round body, long and clumsy legs,\r\nhe is as distinguished for his want of grace and comeliness as the red\r\ndeer is for its presence. No animal is better adapted for its own home\r\nand mode of life. Their heavy coat of hair adapts them to high\r\nlatitudes. With their curved upper lip they take hold of the branches\r\nof the trees, and with their strong teeth and paws they are able to\r\npeel off the tender bark of saplings and small trees. The moose, when\r\nattacked, is fierce, resolute, defiant, and defends himself in a\r\nmasterly manner, striking with his fore legs with such precision that\r\nthe hunter is obliged to keep at a respectful distance. The male moose\r\nwears a remarkable pair of horns of annual growth, to which each year\r\na prong is added. The home of the moose is the northern part of the\r\nNorth Temperate Zone.\r\n\r\nMoose hunting is a healthy though laborious pastime. The hunter must\r\nbe an expert, and it requires years of practice to become skillful. He\r\nmust build his camp in the wilderness, packing thither his food,\r\nblankets, camp utensils and gun. With his pack of dogs he starts out\r\nin search of a moose yard. This is generally in some well timbered\r\ndistrict. The snow in winter is generally from three to six feet deep,\r\nbut the moose has broken paths through this to facilitate his\r\nmovements through the forest, and here he roams about in fancied\r\nsecurity, browsing on the young shrubs, but the hunter finds his\r\nhiding place. In such case he conceals himself in the snow near one of\r\nthese paths and waits patiently till the moose passes, when he fires\r\nupon him. If the moose is killed at once the hunter waits patiently in\r\nhis hiding place till another and another comes up to share a like\r\nfate. If the moose is only wounded he starts off as rapidly through\r\nthe snow as his long legs will carry him, pursued by the hunter and\r\nhis dogs. The hunter has all the advantages of the position, being\r\nmounted on snowshoes, thus being able to move with comparative\r\nswiftness, while the moose plunges heavily through the snow, and at\r\nlast, weakened by loss of blood, he is overtaken and easily killed.\r\n\r\nMOUNT BIGELOW.--This is a noble, grand, historical mountain, situated\r\non the south side of Dead river, in Franklin county. For years it had\r\nbeen my strong desire to make the ascent, and in May, 1833, the desire\r\nwas gratified. With six others, I left camp, and by evening reached\r\nGreen's hotel, where we obtained lodgings for the evening. At early\r\ndawn, having supplied ourselves with lunch, tin cup and hatchet, we\r\nbegan the ascent on the northeast side. We soon passed the thrifty\r\ntimber and aided our ascent of the craggy sides of the mountain by\r\nclinging to the shrubs that found roothold in the crevices of the\r\nrocks. It may not be amiss to say that we rested, that we rested\r\nfrequently, for mountain climbing is no light work for those\r\nunaccustomed to it. While toiling wearily upward we found ourselves\r\nenveloped in mist, or a cloud, from which we soon emerged to find the\r\nheavens above us clear and bright, while leaden clouds shut out the\r\nlandscape below. At twelve o'clock, noon, we were on the summit. By\r\nthis time the clouds had been dispersed. The air was clear and cold\r\nand beneath us lay, as in a beautiful panorama, the lands and lakes of\r\nMaine. There are two peaks, about half a mile apart, between which is\r\na valley and a small lake. From the highest of these peaks the view\r\nwas magnificent. In the far north we imagined we saw Canada. The vast,\r\nnorthern expanse was all unoccupied save by a few farms at the foot of\r\nthe mountain, and by a few camps of lumbermen, hunters and trappers.\r\nLooking to the northeast, we saw in the blue distance, glittering with\r\nsnow drifts, Mount Katahdin. A little north of the divide line to\r\nKatahdin lay Moosehead lake, the largest, most beautiful lake in\r\nMaine.\r\n\r\nAt this season of the year the snow had disappeared from the valleys\r\nand hills, but the summits of the mountains were still white. In all\r\ndirections the scene was grand and inspiring. We could trace the\r\nKennebec river in its windings to the sea and fancied we could see in\r\nthe dim distance the blue Atlantic. To the southwest mountains seemed\r\npiled on mountains, while here and there in intermediate vales bright\r\nlakes reflected the blue of the upper deep. In this direction there\r\nwere farms, but they looked like mere dots on the face of the earth.\r\nLake Umbagog lay coiled in the shade of distant mountains in the\r\nsouthwest. We fancied that we could see the ragged crest of the white\r\nmountain still further beyond. The scene had also its historical\r\nassociations. Along the base of this mountain, on the northwestern\r\nside, ere his name had been sullied by the foulest treason in our\r\ncountry's history, Benedict Arnold bravely led the Colonial troops in\r\nthe campaign against Canada. With him, as an aid, was Col. Bigelow,\r\nwhose name is given to the mountain. The gallant little army halted on\r\nthe banks of Dead river at the base of the mountain, and made their\r\ncamp. While the army was resting at this camp Lieut. Col. Bigelow\r\nascended the mountain and planted his country's flag upon the highest\r\npeak, doubtless the first white man who made the ascent, and the\r\nmountain is his monument to-day. Around the site of the camp was\r\nplanted the colony of Flagstaff.\r\n\r\nWhile we were gazing on the magnificent scene, musing upon its varied\r\nbeauties and recalling its historical associations, the sun set, and\r\nreluctantly we set out on our return, a descent the more perilous\r\nbecause it was growing dark. Extreme caution was necessary;\r\nnevertheless we made good headway, as we found ourselves sometimes\r\nsliding and even rolling down the path that we had ascended with so\r\nmuch difficulty in the forenoon. It was long after nightfall that,\r\ntired and hungry, we reached Wyman's hotel on the banks of Dead river.\r\n\r\nLUMBERING IN MAINE.--The practical lumberman did not usually start his\r\nteams for the pineries until snowfall and the freezing of the lakes\r\nand rivers. The first thing was to select a place for operations. This\r\nwas done in the open season. When the winter had fairly set in the\r\nlumberman, with his ox teams, generally six oxen to a sled, the sleds\r\nladen with camp plunder, would start for the pineries. The slow ox\r\nteams would consume many days making the journey. The crew of men\r\nemployed for the winter generally met the teams in camp. The snow\r\nwould be cleared away for the camp, and a fire built. The cook would\r\nprepare a supper of fried pork, fritters or pancakes, tea, syrup and\r\nNew England apple sauce, the crew meanwhile cutting boughs, wood,\r\netc., and preparing for permanent camp. Supper over, the cattle were\r\ntied to trees and fed. Water was secured for evening use only. A\r\nglowing fire would be kept up, around which the crew would gather to\r\nspend the evening in talking over the adventures of the day,\r\ndiscussing plans for the morrow or singing camp songs. Thus the\r\nevening would pass merrily and swiftly. At the hour for retiring\r\nparties of two would spread their blankets on a couch of fir or cedar\r\nboughs, and lie down to rest. Next morning the cook would rise at four\r\no'clock to prepare breakfast, which over, as soon as it was light\r\nenough the crew would commence the work of the day. Every man goes to\r\nhis assigned duties, the _boss_ in charge having the general\r\noversight.\r\n\r\nThe life of a lumberman is one of exposure to the elements, yet it is\r\nnot necessarily unfriendly to the development of character. With a\r\nwell ordered camp and gentlemanly crew the winter may pass away\r\npleasantly, and the young man engaged in the comparatively hard toil\r\nof the camp, may, with books and papers and cheerful converse with the\r\nmore thoughtful of his elders, improve the long evenings spent around\r\nthe camp fire. Many a Maine boy has received here the greater part of\r\nhis training for the duties of after life.\r\n\r\nSunday was usually occupied in reading, singing, and doing some of the\r\nlighter work of camp, such as repairing sleds, shoeing oxen and making\r\naxe helves or visiting neighboring camps. It was a day of rest only so\r\nfar as the heavier work of the camp was suspended. Sanctuary\r\nprivileges there were none. The work would often close in the sunny\r\ndays of March. The men would mostly depart for home. A few would\r\nremain to drive the logs with the first water from the melting of the\r\nsnows late in April.\r\n\r\nDriving logs in the rapid waters of Maine is hazardous work. Scarcely\r\na day passes without imminent risk to life and limb of the hardy and\r\nventuresome men engaged in the work of breaking log landings and jams,\r\nand running boats. Men are exposed to wet and cold from dawn till\r\ndark. This work requires active and vigorous men, constitutionally\r\nfitted and carefully trained to the work. They are usually sociable,\r\nlively and wide awake, these qualities enabling them to endure, and\r\neven to enjoy, the life of hardship which they lead, and to which they\r\nbecome so accustomed that they are unwilling to leave it until worn\r\nout by its inevitable hardship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nW.

At Stillwater, above Bangor,\r\nI met my kind friend Simeon Goodrich, also out of employment. After\r\nmature deliberation we concluded to go West. Returning to Bloomfield,\r\nI collected the money held for me by Capt. Ruel Weston and was soon in\r\nreadiness for the journey. But a few days before the time agreed upon\r\nfor leaving, I received a letter from Simeon Goodrich, which contained\r\nthe unpleasant information that he could not collect the amount due\r\nhim and could not go with me. Truly this was a disappointment. I was\r\nobliged to set out alone, no light undertaking at that early day, for\r\nas yet there were no long lines of railroad between Maine and the\r\nMississippi river. The day at last arrived for me to start. My\r\ncompanions and acquaintances chaffed me as to the perils of the\r\njourney before me. My mother gave me her parting words, \"William,\r\nalways respect yourself in order to be respected.\" These words,\r\naccompanied with her farewell kiss, were long remembered, and, I doubt\r\nnot, often kept me from evil associations.\r\n\r\nThe stage took us directly to the steamboat at Gardiner. The steam was\r\nup and the boat was soon under way. It was the New England, the first\r\nboat of the kind I had ever seen. I felt strangely unfamiliar with the\r\nways of the traveling world, but observed what others did, and asked\r\nno questions, and so fancied that my ignorance of traveling customs\r\nwould not be exposed. It was sunset as we floated out into the wide\r\nexpanse of the Atlantic. The western horizon was tinged with fiery\r\nhues, the shores grew fainter and receded from view and the eye could\r\nrest at last only upon the watery expanse. All things seemed new and\r\nstrange. Next morning a heavy fog hung over the scene. The vessel was\r\nat anchor in Boston harbor and we were soon on shore and threading the\r\ncrooked streets of the capital of Massachusetts. I was not lost in the\r\nwilderness maze of streets, as I had feared I should be, but on\r\nleaving Boston on the evening train I took the wrong car and found\r\nmyself uncomfortably situated in a second or third class car, crowded\r\nand reeking with vile odors, from which the conductor rescued me,\r\ntaking me to the pleasant and elegant car to which my first class\r\nticket entitled me. On arriving at Providence I followed the crowd to\r\nthe landing and embarked on the steamer President for New York, in\r\nwhich city we remained a day, stopping at the City Hotel on Broadway.\r\nI was greatly impressed with the beauty of part of the city, and the\r\ndesolate appearance of the Burnt District, concerning the burning of\r\nwhich we had read in our winter camp. I was not a little puzzled with\r\nthe arrangement of the hotel tables and the printed bills of fare, but\r\nclosely watched the deportment of others and came through without any\r\nserious or mortifying blunder. Next morning I left New York on the\r\nsteamer Robert L. Stevens for Albany, and on the evening of the same\r\nday went to Schenectady by railroad. Some of the way cars were hauled\r\nby horses up hills and inclined planes. There were then only three\r\nshort lines of railroad in the United States, and I had traveled on\r\ntwo of them. At Schenectady I took passage on a canal boat to Buffalo.\r\nI had read about \"De Witt Clinton's Ditch,\" and now greatly enjoyed\r\nthe slow but safe passage it afforded, and the rich prospect of\r\ncities, villages and cultivated fields through which we passed. At\r\nBuffalo we remained but one day. We there exchanged eastern paper for\r\nwestern, the former not being current in localities further west. At\r\nBuffalo I caught my first glimpse of Lake Erie. I stood upon a\r\nprojecting pier and recalled, in imagination, the brave Commodore\r\nPerry, gallantly defending his country's flag in one of the most\r\nbrilliant engagements of the war, the fame whereof had long been\r\nfamiliar to the whole country and the thrilling incidents of which\r\nwere the theme of story and song even in the wilderness camps of\r\nMaine.\r\n\r\nThe steamer Oliver Newberry bore me from Buffalo to Detroit. From\r\nDetroit to Mt. Clemens, Michigan, I went by stage and stopped at the\r\nlast named place until October 14th, when, being satisfied that the\r\nclimate was unhealthy, fever and ague being very prevalent, I returned\r\nto Detroit, and on the fifteenth of the same month took passage on the\r\nbrig Indiana, as steamers had quit running for the season. The brig\r\nwas aground two days and nights on the St. Clair flats. A south wind\r\ngave us a splendid sail up the Detroit river into Lake Huron. We\r\nlanded for a short time at Fort Gratiot, at the outlet of the lake,\r\njust as the sun was setting. The fort was built of stone, and\r\npresented an impressive appearance. The gaily uniformed officers, the\r\nblue-coated soldiers, moving with the precision of machines, the whole\r\nscene--the fort, the waving flags, the movement of the troops seen in\r\nthe mellow sunset light--was impressive to one who had never looked\r\nupon the like before. A favorable breeze springing up, we sped gaily\r\nout into the blue Lake Huron. At Saginaw bay the pleasant part of the\r\nvoyage ended. The weather became rough. A strong gale blew from the\r\nbay outward, and baffled all the captain's skill in making the proper\r\ndirection. Profane beyond degree was Capt. McKenzie, but his\r\nfree-flowing curses availed him nothing. The brig at one time was so\r\nnearly capsized that her deck load had rolled to one side and held her\r\nin an inclined position. The captain ordered most of the deck load,\r\nwhich consisted chiefly of Chicago liquors, thrown overboard.\r\nUnfortunately, several barrels were saved, two of which stood on deck,\r\nwith open heads. This liquor was free to all. The vessel, lightened of\r\na great part of her load, no longer careened, but stood steady against\r\nthe waves and before the wind. It is a pity that the same could not be\r\nsaid of captain, crew and passengers, who henceforth did the\r\ncareening. They dipped the liquor up in pails and drank it out of\r\nhandled dippers. They got ingloriously drunk; they rolled unsteadily\r\nacross the deck; they quarreled, they fought, they behaved like\r\nBedlamites, and how near shipwreck was the goodly brig from that day's\r\ndrunken debauch on Chicago free liquor will never be known. The vessel\r\ntoiled, the men were incapacitated for work, but notwithstanding the\r\ntempest of profanity and the high winds, the wrangling of crew and\r\ncaptain, we at last passed Saginaw bay. The winds were more favorable.\r\nThence to Mackinaw the sky was clear and bright, the air cold. The\r\nnight before reaching Mackinaw an unusual disturbance occurred above\r\nresulting from the abundance of free liquor. The cook, being drunk,\r\nhad not provided the usual midnight supper for the sailors. The key of\r\nthe caboose was lost; the caboose was broken open, and the mate in the\r\nmorning was emulating the captain in the use of profane words. The\r\nnegro cook answered in the same style, being as drunk as his superior.\r\nThis cook was a stout, well built man, with a forbidding countenance\r\nand, at his best, when sober, was a saucy, ill-natured and impertinent\r\nfellow. When threat after threat had been hurled back and forth, the\r\nnegro jumped at the mate and knocked him down. The sailors, as by a\r\ncommon impetus, seized the negro, bound him tightly and lashed him to\r\na capstan. On searching him they found two loaded pistols. These the\r\nmate placed close to each ear of the bound man, and fired them off.\r\nThey next whipped him on the naked back with a rope. His trunk was\r\nthen examined and several parcels of poison were found. Another\r\nwhipping was administered, and this time the shrieks and groans of the\r\nvictim were piteous. Before he had not even winced. The monster had\r\nprepared himself to deal death alike to crew and passengers, and we\r\nall felt a great sense of relief when Capt. McKenzie delivered him to\r\nthe authorities at Mackinaw.\r\n\r\nAntique Mackinaw was a French and half-breed town. The houses were\r\nbuilt of logs and had steep roofs. Trading posts and whisky shops were\r\nwell barred. The government fort, neatly built and trim, towered up\r\nabove the lake on a rocky cliff and overlooked the town, the whole\r\nforming a picturesque scene. We remained but a few hours at Mackinaw.\r\nThere were ten cabin passengers, and these, with two exceptions, had\r\nimbibed freely of the Chicago free liquor. They were also continually\r\ngambling. Capt. McKenzie had fought a fist fight with a deadhead\r\npassenger, Capt. Fox, bruising him badly. What with his violence and\r\nprofanity, the brutality of the mate and the drunken reveling of crew\r\nand passengers, the two sober passengers had but a sorry time, but the\r\nsafe old brig, badly officered, badly managed, held steadily on its\r\ncourse, and October 30th, fifteen days from Detroit, safely landed us\r\nin Chicago.\r\n\r\nAfter being so long on the deck of a tossing vessel, I experienced a\r\nstrange sensation when first on shore. I had become accustomed to the\r\nmotion of the vessel, and had managed to hold myself steady. On shore\r\nthe pitching and tossing movement seemed to continue, only it seemed\r\ntransferred to my head, which grew dizzy, and so produced the\r\nillusion that I was still trying to balance myself on the unsteady\r\ndeck of the ship.\r\n\r\nChicago, since become a great city, had at that time the appearance of\r\nan active, growing village. Thence I proceeded, November 1st and 2d,\r\nby stage to Milwaukee, which appeared also as a village, but somewhat\r\novergrown. Idle men were numerous, hundreds not being able to obtain\r\nemployment. Here I remained a couple of weeks, stopping at the\r\nBelleview House. After which I chopped wood a few days for Daniel\r\nWells. Not finding suitable employment, I started west with a Mr.\r\nRogers, December 2d. There being no other means of conveyance, we\r\ntraveled on foot. On the evening of the second we stopped at Prairie\r\nVillage, now known as Waukesha. On the evening of the third we stopped\r\nat Meacham's Prairie, and on the fifth reached Rock River, where I\r\nstopped with a Mr. St. John. The evening following we stopped at an\r\nIrish house, where the surroundings did not conduce to comfort or to a\r\nfeeling of security. Several drunken men kept up a continuous row. We\r\nhid our money in a haystack, and took our turn sleeping and keeping\r\nwatch. We ate an early breakfast, and were glad to get away before the\r\nmen who had created such a disturbance during the night were up. We\r\nmoved onward on the seventh to Blue Mound, where we found a cheerful\r\nresting place at Brigham's. The eighth brought us to Dodgeville, where\r\nwe stopped at Morrison's. On the ninth we reached Mineral Point, the\r\nlocality of the lead mines, where I afterward lost much time in\r\nprospecting. Mineral Point was then a rude mining town. The night of\r\nour arrival was one of excitement and hilarity in the place. The first\r\nlegislature of the territory of Wisconsin had been in session at\r\nBelmont, near Mineral Point, had organized the new government and\r\nclosed its session on that day. To celebrate this event and their\r\nemancipation from the government of Michigan and the location of the\r\ncapital at Madison, the people from the Point, and all the region\r\nround about, had met and prepared a banquet for the retiring members\r\nof the legislature. Madison was at that time a paper town, in the\r\nwilderness, but beautifully located on Cat Fish lake, and at the head\r\nof Rock river. The location had been accomplished by legislative tact,\r\nand a compromise between the extremes. In view of the almost certain\r\ndivision of the Territory, with the Mississippi river as a boundary,\r\nat no very distant day, it was agreed that Madison should be the\r\npermanent capital, while Burlington, now in Iowa, should be used\r\ntemporarily. Milwaukee and Green Bay had both aspired to the honor of\r\nbeing chosen as the seat of government. Mineral Point, with her rich\r\nmines, had also aspirations, as had Cassville, which latter named\r\nvillage had even built a great hotel for the accommodation of the\r\nmembers of the assembly. Dubuque put in a claim, but all in vain.\r\nMadison was chosen, and wisely, and she has ever since succeeded in\r\nmaintaining the supremacy then thrust upon her.\r\n\r\nIn my boyhood, at school, I had read of the great Northwest Territory.\r\nIt seemed to me then far away, at the world's end, but I had\r\npositively told my comrades that I should one day go there. I found\r\nmyself at last on the soil, and at a period or crisis important in its\r\nhistory. The great Northwest Territory, ceded by Virginia to the\r\nUnited States in 1787, was no more. The immense territory had been\r\ncarved and sliced into states and territories, and now the last\r\nremaining fragment, under the name of Wisconsin, had assumed\r\nterritorial prerogatives, organized its government, and, with direct\r\nreference to a future division of territory, had selected its future\r\ncapital, for as yet, except in name, Madison was not. In assuming\r\nterritorial powers, the boundaries had been enlarged so as to include\r\npart of New Louisiana, and the first legislature had virtually\r\nbartered away this part of her domain, of which Burlington, temporary\r\ncapital of Wisconsin, was to be the future capital.\r\n\r\nTwo more days of foot plodding brought us to Galena, the city of lead.\r\nThe greeting on our entering the city was the ringing of bells, the\r\nclattering of tin pans, the tooting of ox horns, sounds earthly and\r\nunearthly,--sounds no man can describe. What could it be? Was it for\r\nthe benefit of two humble, footsore pedestrians that all this uproar\r\nwas produced? We gave it up for the time, but learned subsequently\r\nthat it was what is known as a charivari, an unmusical and disorderly\r\nserenade, generally gotten up for the benefit of some newly married\r\ncouple, whose nuptials had not met with popular approval.\r\n\r\nAt Galena I parted with Mr. Rogers, my traveling companion, who went\r\nsouth. On the fifteenth of December I traveled to Dubuque on foot.\r\nWhen I came to the Mississippi river I sat down on its banks and\r\nrecalled the humorous description of old Mr. Carson, my neighbor, to\r\nwhich I had listened wonderingly when a small boy. \"It was,\" he said,\r\n\"a river so wide you could scarcely see across it. The turtles in it\r\nwere big as barn doors, and their shells would make good ferryboats if\r\nthey could only be kept above water.\" Sure enough, here was the big\r\nriver, but covered with ice, scarcely safe to venture on. Several\r\npersons desiring to cross, we made a portable bridge of boards,\r\nsliding them along with us till we were safe on the opposite bank. I\r\nwas now at the end of my journey, on the west bank of the Mississippi,\r\nbeyond which stretched a vast and but little known region, inhabited\r\nby Indians and wild beasts.\r\n\r\nAs I review the incidents of my journey in 1836, I can not but\r\ncontrast the conditions of that era and the present. How great the\r\nchange in half a century! The journey then required thirty days. It\r\nnow requires but three. I had passed over but two short lines of\r\nrailroad, and had made the journey by canal boat, by steamer, by\r\nstage, and a large portion of it on foot. There were few regularly\r\nestablished lines of travel. From Michigan to the Mississippi there\r\nwere no stages nor were there any regular southern routes. Travelers\r\nto the centre of the continent, in those days, came either by the\r\nwater route, via New Orleans or the Fox and Wisconsin river route, or\r\nfollowed Indian trails or blazed lines from one settlement to another.\r\nThe homes of the settlers were rude--were built principally of logs.\r\nIn forest regions the farms consisted of clearings or square patches\r\nof open ground, well dotted with stumps and surrounded by a dense\r\ngrowth of timber. The prairies, except around the margins or along\r\ncertain belts of timber following the course of streams, were without\r\ninhabitants. Hotels were few and far between, and, when found, not\r\nmuch superior to the cabins of the settlers; but the traveler was\r\nalways and at all places hospitably entertained.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUBUQUE.\r\n\r\nDubuque was a town of about three hundred inhabitants, attracted\r\nthither by the lead mines. The people were principally of the mining\r\nclass. The prevailing elements amongst them were Catholic and Orange\r\nIrish. These two parties were antagonistic and would quarrel on the\r\nstreets or wherever brought in contact. Sundays were especially days\r\nof strife, and Main street was generally the field of combat. Women\r\neven participated. There was no law, there were no police to enforce\r\norder. The fight went on, the participants pulling hair, gouging,\r\nbiting, pummeling with fists or pounding with sticks, till one or the\r\nother party was victorious. These combats were also accompanied with\r\nvolleys of profanity, and unlimited supplies of bad whisky served as\r\nfuel to the flame of discord. Dubuque was certainly the worst town in\r\nthe West, and, in a small way, the worst in the whole country. The\r\nentire country west of the Mississippi was without law, the government\r\nof Wisconsin Territory not yet being extended to it. Justice, such as\r\nit was, was administered by Judge Lynch and the mob.\r\n\r\nMy first employment was working a hand furnace for smelting lead ore\r\nfor a man named Kelly, a miner and a miser. He lived alone in a\r\nmiserable hovel, and on the scantiest fare. In January I contracted to\r\ndeliver fifty cords of wood at Price's brickyard. I cut the wood from\r\nthe island in front of the present city of Dubuque, and hired a team\r\nto deliver it.\r\n\r\nWhile in Dubuque I received my first letter from home in seven months.\r\nWhat a relief it was, after a period of long suspense, spent in\r\ntediously traveling over an almost wilderness country,--amidst\r\nunpleasant surroundings, amongst strangers, many of them of the baser\r\nsort, drinking, card playing, gambling and quarreling,--what a relief\r\nit was to receive a letter from home with assurances of affectionate\r\nregard from those I most esteemed.\r\n\r\nTruly the lines had not fallen to me in pleasant places, and I was\r\nsometimes exposed to perils from the lawless characters by whom I was\r\nsurrounded. On one occasion a dissolute and desperate miner, named\r\nGilbert, came to Cannon's hotel, which was my boarding house while in\r\nDubuque. He usually came over from the east side of the river once a\r\nweek for a spree. On this occasion, being very drunk, he was more than\r\nusually offensive and commenced abusing Cannon, the landlord, applying\r\nto him some contemptuous epithet. I thoughtlessly remarked to Cannon,\r\n\"You have a new name,\" upon which Gilbert cocked his pistol and aiming\r\nat me was about to fire when Cannon, quick as thought, struck at his\r\narm and so destroyed his aim that the bullet went over my head. The\r\nreport of the pistol brought others to the room and a general melee\r\nensued in which the bar was demolished, the stove broken and Gilbert\r\nunmercifully whipped. Gilbert was afterward shot in a drunken brawl.\r\n\r\nI formed some genial acquaintances in Dubuque, amongst them Gen.\r\nBooth, Messrs. Brownell, Wilson and others, since well known in the\r\nhistory of the country. Price, the wood contractor, never paid me for\r\nmy work. I invested what money I had left for lots in Madison, all of\r\nwhich I lost, and had, in addition, to pay a note I had given on the\r\nlots.\r\n\r\nOn February 11th I went to Cassville, journeying thither on the ice.\r\nThis village had flourished greatly, in the expectation of becoming\r\nthe territorial and state capital, expectations doomed, as we have\r\nseen, to disappointment. It is romantically situated amidst\r\npicturesque bluffs, some of which tower aloft like the walls and\r\nturrets of an ancient castle, a characteristic that attaches to much\r\nof the bluff scenery along this point.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRAIRIE DU CHIEN.\r\n\r\nI reached this old French town on the twelfth of February. The town\r\nand settlement adjacent extended over a prairie nine miles long, and\r\nfrom one to two miles broad, a beautiful plateau of land, somewhat\r\nsandy, but for many years abundantly productive, furnishing supplies\r\nto traders and to the military post established there. It also\r\nfurnished two cargoes of grain to be used as seed by the starving\r\nsettlement at Selkirk, which were conveyed thither by way of the\r\nMississippi, St. Peter and Red rivers. The earliest authentic mention\r\nof the place refers to the establishment of a post called St.\r\nNicholas, on the east bank of the Mississippi, at the mouth of the\r\nWisconsin, by Gov. De La Barre, who, in 1683, sent Nicholas Perrot\r\nwith a garrison of twenty men to hold the post. The first official\r\ndocument laying claim to the country on the Upper Mississippi, issued\r\nin 1689, has mention of the fort. This document we transcribe entire:\r\n\r\n\"Nicholas Perrot, commanding for the king, at the post of the\r\nNadouessioux, commissioned by the Marquis Denonville, governor and\r\nlieutenant governor of all New France, to manage the interests of\r\ncommerce amongst the Indian tribes and people of the Bay des Puants\r\n(Green Bay), Nadouessioux (Dakotahs), Maseontins, and other western\r\nnations of the Upper Mississippi, and to take possession in the king's\r\nname of all the places where he has heretofore been, and whither he\r\nwill go.\r\n\r\n\"We, this day, the eighth of May, one thousand six hundred and\r\neighty-nine, do, in the presence of the Reverend Father Marest, of the\r\nSociety of Jesus, missionary among the Nadouessioux; of Monsieur de\r\nBorieguillot (or Boisguillot), commanding the French in the\r\nneighborhood of the Ouiskonche (Wisconsin), on the Mississippi;\r\nAugustin Le Gardeur, Esq., Sieur de Caurnont, and of Messeurs Le\r\nSueur, Hibert, Lemire and Blein:\r\n\r\n\"Declare to all whom it may concern, that, being come from the Bay des\r\nPuants, and to the lake of the Ouiskonches, and to river Mississippi,\r\nwe did transport ourselves to the country of the Nadouessioux, on the\r\nborder of the river St. Croix, and at the mouth of the river St.\r\nPierre (Minnesota), on the bank of which were the Mantantans; and\r\nfurther up to the interior to the northeast of the Mississippi, as far\r\nas the Menchokatoux, with whom dwell the majority of the Songeskitens,\r\nand other Nadouessioux, who are to the northeast of the Mississippi,\r\nto take possession for, and in the name of, the king of the countries\r\nand rivers inhabited by the said tribes, and of which they are\r\nproprietors. The present act done in our presence, signed with our\r\nhand and subscribed.\"\r\n\r\nThen follow the names of the persons mentioned. The document was drawn\r\nup at Green Bay.\r\n\r\nThere is little doubt that this post was held continuously by the\r\nFrench as a military post until 1696, when the French authorities at\r\nQuebec withdrew all their troops from Wisconsin, and as a trader's\r\npost or settlement, until the surrender in 1763 to the British of all\r\nFrench claims east of the Mississippi. It was probably garrisoned near\r\nthe close of the latter period. It remained in the possession of the\r\nFrench some time, as the English, thinking it impossible to compete\r\nfor the commerce of the Indian tribes with the French traders who had\r\nintermarried with them, and so acquired great influence, did not take\r\nactual possession until many years later.\r\n\r\nThe post is occasionally mentioned by the early voyageurs, and the\r\nprairie which it commanded was known as the \"Prairie du Chien,\" or\r\npraire of the dog, as early as 1763, and is so mentioned by Carver. It\r\nwas not formally taken possession of by the United States until 1814,\r\nwhen Gov. Clarke with two hundred men came up from St. Louis to\r\nPrairie du Chien, then under English rule, to build a fort and\r\nprotect American interests at the village. At that time there were\r\nabout fifty families, descended chiefly from the old French settlers.\r\nThese were engaged chiefly in farming, owning a common field four\r\nmiles long by a half mile wide. They had outside of this three\r\nseparate farms and twelve horse mills to manufacture their produce.\r\nThe fort, held by a few British troops under Capt. Deace, surrendered\r\nwithout resistance, but soon after the British traders at Mackinaw\r\nsent an expedition under Joe Rolette, Sr., to recapture the post,\r\nwhich they did after a siege of three days, the defenders being\r\nallowed to withdraw with their private property on parole. They were\r\nfollowed by the Indians as far as Rock Island. Meanwhile, Lieut.\r\nCampbell, with reinforcements on his way from St. Louis, was attacked,\r\npart were captured and the remainder of his troops driven back to St.\r\nLouis. Late in 1814 Maj. Zachary Taylor proceeded with gunboats to\r\nchastize the Indians for their attack on Campbell, but was himself met\r\nand driven back. The following year, on the declaration of peace\r\nbetween Great Britain and America, the post at Prairie du Chien was\r\nevacuated. The garrison fired the fort as they withdrew from it.\r\n\r\nThe fort erected by the Americans under Gen. Clarke in 1814 was called\r\nFort Shelby. The British, on capturing it, changed the name to Fort\r\nMcKay. The Americans, on assuming possession and rebuilding it, named\r\nit Fort Crawford. It stood on the bank of the river at the north end\r\nof St. Friole, the old French village occupied in 1876 by the\r\nDousmans. In 1833 the new Fort Crawford was built on an elevated site\r\nabout midway in the prairie. It was a strong military post and was\r\ncommanded at this time by Gen. Zachary Taylor. Many officers, who\r\nsubsequently won distinction in the Florida Indian, Mexican, and late\r\nCivil War, were stationed here from time to time. Within a time\r\nincluded in my own recollections of the post, Jefferson Davis spirited\r\naway the daughter of his commanding officer, Gen. Taylor, and married\r\nher, the \"rough and ready\" general being averse to the match.\r\n\r\nPrairie du Chien derived its name from a French family known as du\r\nChien, in English \"The Dog.\" By this name the Prairie was known long\r\nprior to the establishment of the French stockade and post. By that\r\nname it has been known and recognized ever since. It has been\r\nsuccessively under the French, English and United States governments,\r\nand lying originally in the great Northwestern Territory, in the\r\nsubsequent divisions of that immense domain, it has been included\r\nwithin the bounds of the territories of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois,\r\nMichigan, and Wisconsin. Gov. Wm. H. Harrison, of Indiana Territory,\r\nrecognized Prairie du Chien by issuing commissions to Henry M. Fisher\r\nand ---- Campbell as justices of the peace, the first civil\r\ncommissions issued for the American government in the entire district\r\nof country including West Wisconsin and Minnesota east of the\r\nMississippi. Prior to this time, about 1819, the inhabitants had been\r\nchiefly under military rule. In 1819 the county of Crawford was\r\norganized as a part of Michigan Territory, and blank commissions were\r\nissued to Nicholas Boilvin, Esq., with authority to appoint and\r\ninstall the officers of the new county government. Gov. Lewis Cass\r\nestablished by proclamation the county seat at Prairie du Chien, and\r\nJohn W. Johnson was installed as chief justice of the county court.\r\nThe entire corps of officers were qualified. In January, 1823,\r\nCongress passed an act providing for circuit courts in the counties\r\nwest and north of Lake Michigan, and James Duane Doty was appointed\r\njudge for the district composed of Brown, Mackinaw and Crawford\r\ncounties, and a May term was held in Prairie du Chien the same year.\r\n\r\nINDIAN TROUBLES.--There were some Indian troubles, an account of which\r\nis given in the biographical sketch of J. H. Lockwood. There were\r\nother incidents which may be worthy of separate mention. In 1827 an\r\nentire family, named Methode, were murdered, as is supposed, by the\r\nIndians, though the murderers were never identified. The great\r\nincentive to violence and rapine with the Indians was whisky. An\r\nintelligent Winnebago, aged about sixty years, told me that\r\n\"paganini,\" \"firewater\" (whisky), was killing the great majority of\r\nhis people, and making fools and cripples of those that were left;\r\nthat before the pale faces came to the big river his people were good\r\nhunters and had plenty to eat; that now they were drunken, lazy and\r\nhungry; that they once wore elk or deer skins, that now they were clad\r\nin blankets or went naked. This Indian I had never seen drunk. The\r\nAmerican Fur Company had huts or open houses where the Indians might\r\ndrink and revel.\r\n\r\nAt an Indian payment a young, smart looking Indian got drunk and in a\r\nquarrel killed his antagonist. The friends of the murdered Indian held\r\na council and determined that the murderer should have an opportunity\r\nof running for his life. The friends of the murdered Indian formed in\r\na line, at the head of which was stationed the brother of the dead\r\nman, who was to lead in the pursuit. At a signal the bands of the\r\nprisoner were cut, and with a demoniacal yell he bounded forward, the\r\nentire line in swift and furious pursuit. Should he outrun his\r\npursuers, he would be free; should they overtake and capture him, they\r\nwere to determine the mode of his death. He ran nearly a mile when he\r\ntripped and fell. The brother of the dead Indian, heading the pursuit,\r\npounced upon him and instantly killed him with a knife.\r\n\r\nConsidering the fact that the Indians were gathered together under the\r\nguns of a United States fort, and under the protection of a law\r\nexpressly forbidding the sale of intoxicating liquors to them, the\r\npeople of the United States were certainly justified in expecting\r\nbetter results, not only in regard to the protection of the frontier\r\nsettlers but for that of the Indians themselves. All came to naught\r\nbecause of the non-enforcement of law. Liquors were shamelessly sold\r\nto the Indians and they were encouraged to drunken revelry and orgies\r\nby the very men who should have protected and restrained them.\r\n\r\nThe prosperity of Prairie du Chien depended upon the Indian trade, and\r\nupon government contracts which the presence of a military force\r\nrendered necessary. The Indians gathered here in great numbers.\r\n\r\nHere the Winnebagoes, part of the Menomonies and some Chippewas\r\nreceived their annuities, and here centred also an immense trade from\r\nthe American Fur Company, the depot being a large stone building on\r\nthe banks of the Mississippi, under the charge of Hercules Dousman.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORT CRAWFORD ROBBED.\r\n\r\nTwo discharged soldiers (Thompson and Evans) living at Patch Grove,\r\nthirteen miles away, visited the fort often. On a morning after one of\r\ntheir visits a soldier on guard noticed a heap of fresh earth near the\r\nmagazine. An alarm was given, an examination made, and it was found\r\nthat the magazine had been burst open with bars and sledge hammers,\r\nentrance having been obtained by digging under the corner picket.\r\nThree kegs of silver, each containing $5,000, were missing. The kegs\r\nhad been passed through the excavation underneath the picket. One keg\r\nhad burst open near the picket, and the silver was found buried in the\r\nsand. The second keg burst on the bank of the Mississippi, and all the\r\nmoney was found buried there except about six hundred dollars. The\r\nthird keg was found months after by John Brinkman, in the bottom of\r\nthe river, two miles below the fort. He was spearing fish by\r\ntorchlight, when he chanced to find the keg. The keg he delivered at\r\nthe fort and received a small reward. On opening the keg it was found\r\nto contain coin of a different kind from that advertised as stolen.\r\nBrinkman, however, made no claims on account of errors. Thompson,\r\nEvans, and a man named Shields were arrested by the civil authorities\r\non suspicion; their trial was continued from term to term and they\r\nwere at last dismissed. One man, who had seen the silver in the sand\r\nduring the day and gone back at night to fill his pockets, was seized\r\nby a soldier on guard, imprisoned for a year, and discharged.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY JUSTICE.\r\n\r\nA Frenchman shot and killed a couple of tame geese belonging to a\r\nneighbor, supposing them to be wild. Discovering his mistake, he\r\nbrought the geese to the owner, a Dutchman, who flew into a great\r\nrage, but took the geese and used them for his own table, in addition\r\nto which he had the goose-killer arrested and tried before Martin\r\nSavall, a justice of the peace. The defendant admitted the killing of\r\nthe geese, the plaintiff admitted receiving them and using them for\r\nfood, nevertheless the justice gave judgment in favor of plaintiff by\r\nthe novel ruling that these geese, if not killed, would have laid eggs\r\nand hatched about eight goslings. The defendant was therefore fined\r\nthree dollars for the geese killed, and eight dollars for the goslings\r\nthat might have been hatched if the geese had been permitted to live,\r\nand costs besides. Plaintiff appealed to the district court which\r\nreversed the decision on the ground that plaintiff had eaten his\r\ngeese, and the goslings, not being hatched, did not exist. Plaintiff\r\npaid the costs of the suit, forty-nine dollars, remarking that a\r\nDutchman had no chance in this country; that he would go back to\r\nGermany. The judge remarked that it would be the best thing he could\r\ndo.\r\n\r\n\r\nA SOUTHWARD JOURNEY.\r\n\r\nMy original plan on leaving Maine was to make a prospecting tour\r\nthrough the West and South. I had been in Prairie du Chien for a\r\nseason, and as soon as my contract to cut hay for the fort and my\r\nharvesting work was done. I started, with two of my comrades, in a\r\nbirch bark canoe for New Orleans. This mode of traveling proving slow\r\nand tedious, after two days, on our arrival at Dubuque, we sold our\r\ncanoe and took passage on the steamer Smelter for St. Louis, which\r\nplace we reached on the seventeenth of October. We remained five days,\r\nstopping at the Union Hotel. St. Louis was by far the finest and\r\nlargest city I had yet seen in the West. Its levee was crowded with\r\ndrays and other vehicles and lined with steamers and barges. Its\r\ngeneral appearance betokened prosperity. On the twenty-second, I left\r\non the steamer George Collier for New Orleans, but the yellow fever\r\nbeing reported in that city, I remained several days at Baton Rouge.\r\nOn the second of November I re-embarked for New Orleans, where I found\r\na lodging at the Conti Street Hotel. New Orleans was even then a large\r\nand beautiful city. Its levee and streets were remarkable for their\r\ncleanness, but seemed almost deserted. Owing to a recent visitation of\r\nthe yellow fever and the financial crisis of 1837, business was almost\r\nsuspended. These were hard times in New Orleans. Hundreds of men were\r\nseeking employment, and many of them were without money or friends. It\r\nwas soon very evident to me that I had come to a poor place to better\r\nmy fortunes. After a thorough canvass, I found but one situation\r\nvacant, and that was in a drinking saloon, and was not thought of for\r\nan instant. I remained fifteen days, my money gradually diminishing,\r\nwhen I concluded to try the interior. I took steamer for Vicksburg,\r\nand thence passed up the Yazoo to Manchester, where I spent two days\r\nin the vain search for employment, offering to do any kind of work. I\r\nwas in the South, where the labor was chiefly done by negroes. I was\r\nfriendless and without letters of recommendation, and for a man under\r\nsuch circumstances to be asking for employment was in itself a\r\nsuspicious circumstance. I encountered everywhere coldness and\r\ndistrust. I returned to Vicksburg, and, fortunately, had still enough\r\nmoney left to secure a deck passage to the North, but was obliged to\r\nlive sparingly, and sleep without bedding. I kept myself somewhat\r\naloof from the crew and passengers. The captain and clerk commented on\r\nmy appearance, and were, as I learned from a conversation that I could\r\nnot help but overhear, keeping a close eye upon me for being so quiet\r\nand restrained. It was true that the western rivers were infested with\r\ndesperate characters, gamblers and thieves such as the Murrell gang.\r\nMight I not be one of them. I was truly glad when, on the fifth of\r\nDecember, we landed at St. Louis. It seemed nearer my own country; but\r\nfinding no employment there, I embarked on the steamer Motto for\r\nHennepin, Illinois, where I found occasional employment cutting\r\ntimber. There was much talk here of the Murrell gang, then terrorizing\r\nthe country; and I have good reason to believe that some of them at\r\nthat time were in Hennepin. After remaining about two months, I left,\r\non foot, valise in hand or strapped upon my back, with J. Simpson, for\r\nGalena, which place we reached in four days. Finding here Mr. Putnam,\r\nwith a team, I went up with him on the ice to Prairie du Chien, where,\r\nafter an absence of five months of anxiety, suspense and positive\r\nhardships, I was glad to find myself once more among friends.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1838 I cultivated a farm. I had also a hay\r\ncontract for the fort. My partner was James C. Bunker. I had worked\r\nhard and succeeded in raising a good crop, but found myself in the\r\nfall the victim of bilious fever and ague. I continued farming in 1839\r\nand furnishing hay to the fort, but continued to suffer with chills\r\nand fever. Myself and partner were both affected, and at times could\r\nscarcely take care of ourselves. Help could not be obtained, but ague\r\ncomes so regularly to torture its victims that, knowing the exact hour\r\nof its approach, we could prepare in advance for it, and have our\r\nwater, gruel, boneset and quinine ready and within reach. We knew when\r\nwe would shake, but not the degree of fever which would follow. The\r\ndelirium of the fever would fill our minds with strange fancies. On\r\none occasion I came home with the ague fit upon me, hitched my horses\r\nwith wagon attached to a post and went into the house. Banker had\r\npassed the shaking stage, and was delirious. I threw myself on the\r\nbed, and the fever soon following, I knew nothing till morning, when I\r\nfound the team still hitched to the post, and, in their hunger, eating\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIn November of this year I made a somewhat perilous trip with team to\r\nFort Winnebago, at the portage of the Fox and Wisconsin rivers. The\r\nweather was cold and the military road, much of the distance, covered\r\nwith snow. There was scarcely a trail over the rolling prairie to\r\nguide me. Exposure brought on the chills as I was returning. Fatigued,\r\nsick and suffering, I coiled myself on the top of the load. The second\r\nday, as the sun was setting, I came in sight of Parish's Grove, but\r\nthe horses were unwilling to obey my guidance. Coming to a fork in the\r\nroad they insisted on going to the right. I pulled them to the left.\r\nHad I been guided by their \"horse sense\" they would have brought me in\r\na few moments to the door of Parish's hotel. As it was, I drove on\r\nuntil far in the night, when we came to a steep hill, two steep for\r\ndescent in the wagon. I unhitched the team, loaded them with the\r\nportable things in the wagon to keep them from the wolves that were\r\nhowling around, mounted one of the horses and descended the hill and\r\nfound myself at Parish's door, the very place I had been trying to\r\nfind for a day and a night. Lieut. Caldwell, quartermaster at Fort\r\nCrawford, received the load, and learning something of the perils of\r\nthe journey, gave me eighty dollars instead of the forty he had\r\npromised.\r\n\r\n\r\nRETURN TO MAINE.\r\n\r\nDuring the spring and summer of 1840, I fulfilled heavy hay and wood\r\ncontracts for the fort, and in the autumn of that year concluded to\r\nrevisit my early home in Maine. I set out September 23d, and reached\r\nChicago in seven days, traveling with a team. I traveled thence by\r\nsteamer to Buffalo, by canal boat to Rochester, by railroad and stage\r\nto Albany and Boston, by railroad to Lowell, and by stage to Tamworth,\r\nNew Hampshire. After spending four years amidst the prairies of the\r\nWest it was indeed a pleasure to look again upon the grand ranges of\r\nmountains in this part of New England. When eleven years of age I had\r\nlived where I could look upon these mountains, and now to their\r\ngrandeur was added the charm of old association. I looked with\r\npleasure once more upon \"Old Ossipee,\" Coroway Peak, and White Face.\r\nTime had written no changes upon these rugged mountains. There were\r\ncottages and farms on the mountain side. Sparkling rivulets gleamed in\r\nthe sunlight, as they found their way, leaping from rock to rock, to\r\nthe valleys beneath. Tamworth is situated on beautiful ridges amongst\r\nthese mountain ranges. Near this place is the old family burying\r\nground containing the graves of my grand parents and other near\r\nrelatives. These mountain peaks seemed to stand as sentinels over\r\ntheir last resting place. I remained at Tamworth a short time, visited\r\nthe graves of my kindred, and on October 20th pursued my journey to\r\nBloomfield, Maine, my old home. I found great changes. Some kind\r\nfriends remained, but others were gone. The old home was changed and I\r\nfelt that I could not make my future home here. The great West seemed\r\nmore than ever attractive. There would I build my home, and seek my\r\nfortune. I found here one who was willing to share that home and\r\nwhatever fortune awaited me in the West. On January 1st I was married\r\nto Mary J. Wyman, by Rev. Arthur Drinkwater, who gave us good counsel\r\non the eve of our departure to a new and still wilderness country. On\r\nFebruary 16th we bade adieu to our friends in Maine, visited awhile at\r\nTamworth, and March 20th reached Prairie du Chien, having traveled by\r\nprivate conveyance, stage and steamer, passing through New Haven, New\r\nYork, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Frederick City, Maryland, over the\r\nNational road to Wheeling, Virginia, by steamer down the Ohio and up\r\nthe Mississippi to our destination. Here we made our home until the\r\nautumn of 1845, I continuing in the business in which I had been\r\npreviously engaged. At this time a failure in my wife's health\r\nrendered a change of climate necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRAIRIE DU CHIEN IN 1836-37.\r\n\r\nOur history of Fifty Years in the Northwest commences properly at\r\nPrairie du Chien in the years 1836-37. The entire country west and\r\nnorth was at that time but little better than a wilderness. Prairie du\r\nChien was an outpost of civilization. A few adventurous traders and\r\nmissionaries had penetrated the country above, planting a few stations\r\nhere and there, and some little effort had been made at settlement,\r\nbut the country, for the most part, was the home of roving tribes of\r\nIndians, and he who adventured among them at any distance from posts\r\nor settlements did so at considerable peril. Prairie du Chien, as we\r\nhave shown, had been for an indefinite period under various\r\ngovernments, at first a French, and later an American settlement,\r\ngenerally under the protection of a military force. It was a primitive\r\nlooking village. The houses were built for the most part of upright\r\ntimber posts and puncheons, and were surrounded by pickets. There was\r\nno effort at display. Every thing was arranged for comfort and\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN RESIDENTS.\r\n\r\nThere were living at Prairie du Chien in 1837 the following Americans\r\nwith their families: Alfred Brunson, Thomas P. Burnett, Joseph M. and\r\nThomas P. Street, Ezekiel Tainter, John Thomas, Milo Richards, John H.\r\nFonday, Samuel Gilbert, and William Wilson. The following were\r\nunmarried: James B. Dallam, Ira B. Brunson, William S. Lockwood, and\r\nHercules Dousman. In addition to these were perhaps near a hundred\r\nFrench families, old residents. Among the more noted were the\r\nBrisbois, La Chapelle, Rolette and Bruno families.\r\n\r\nWe include in the following biographical sketches some names of\r\nnon-residents, prominent in the early territorial history, and others\r\nwho came to Prairie du Chien later than 1837.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIOGRAPHIES.\r\n\r\nJAMES DUANE DOTY.--The life of this eminent citizen is so interwoven\r\nwith the history of Wisconsin that it might well claim more space than\r\nis here allotted to it. The plan of this work forbids more than a\r\nbrief mention, and we therefore give only the principal events in his\r\nlife. Mr. Doty was born in Salem, Washington county, New York, where\r\nhe spent his early days. After receiving a thorough literary education\r\nhe studied law, and in 1818 located at Detroit, Michigan. In 1820, in\r\ncompany with Gov. Cass, he made a canoe voyage of exploration through\r\nLakes Huron and Michigan. On this voyage they negotiated treaties with\r\nthe Indians, and returning made a report on the comparatively\r\nunexplored region which they had traversed. Under his appointment as\r\njudge for the counties of Michigan west of the lake, which appointment\r\nhe held for nine years, he first made his home at Prairie du Chien,\r\nwhere he resided one year, thence removing to Green Bay for the\r\nremainder of his term of office, at which place he continued to\r\nreside for a period of twenty years. In 1830 he was appointed one of\r\nthe commissioners to locate military routes from Green Bay to Chicago\r\nand Prairie du Chien. In 1834 he represented the counties west of the\r\nlake in the Michigan legislative council at Detroit, at which council\r\nthe first legislative action was taken affecting these counties. At\r\nthat session he introduced a bill to create the state of Michigan,\r\nwhich was adopted. The result of this action was the creation of the\r\nterritory of Wisconsin in 1836. In 1838 Mr. Doty was chosen\r\nterritorial delegate to Congress from Wisconsin, in which capacity he\r\nserved four years, when he was appointed governor. He served as\r\ngovernor three years. He acted as commissioner in negotiating Indian\r\ntreaties. In 1846 he was a member of the first constitutional\r\nconvention. In 1848 he was elected member of Congress, and was\r\nre-elected in 1851.\r\n\r\nSomewhere in the '50s he built a log house on an island in Fox river,\r\njust above Butte des Mortes, and lived there with his family many\r\nyears. There he gathered ancient curiosities, consisting of Indian\r\nimplements, and relics of the mound builders. This log house still\r\nstands and is kept intact with the curiosities gathered there by the\r\npresent owner, John Roberts, to whom they were presented by Mrs.\r\nFitzgerald, a daughter of Gov. Doty, in 1877. The cabin overlooks the\r\ncities of Menasha and Neenah, and the old council ground at the outlet\r\nof Lake Winnebago, where the Fox and Sioux Indians held annual\r\ncouncils, also the old battle ground where the Fox Indians routed the\r\nSioux in one of the hardest fought battles on record.\r\n\r\nIn 1861 Judge Doty was appointed superintendent of Indian affairs, and\r\nsubsequently was appointed governor of Utah Territory, which place he\r\nheld until his death in 1865. Wisconsin had no truer friend nor more\r\nfaithful and efficient servant. His aims were exalted, and he\r\ndeservedly held a high place in the affections of his fellow citizens.\r\n\r\nJAMES H. LOCKWOOD.--Mr. Lockwood was the only practicing lawyer at the\r\norganization of Judge Doty's court. He was the pioneer lawyer in\r\nPrairie du Chien, and the first lawyer admitted to the bar in what is\r\nnow Wisconsin. He practiced in Crawford, Brown and Mackinaw counties.\r\nHe was born in Peru, Clinton county, New York, Dec. 7, 1793. He\r\nmarried Julia Warren in 1822. She died at Prairie du Chien in 1827.\r\nHe married his second wife, Sarah A. Wright, in St. Louis, Missouri,\r\nin 1834. She died at Prairie du Chien in 1877, much esteemed as one of\r\nthe pioneer women of the Upper Mississippi, and respected as a devout\r\nChristian, whose faith was proven by her works. The early years of Mr.\r\nLockwood were spent on a farm. He had not the privileges of a\r\nclassical education, and he may be said to be self educated. In 1810\r\nhe commenced the study of law. In 1814 he was sutler in the United\r\nStates army, and in 1815 at the post at Mackinaw. From 1816 to 1819 he\r\nwas an Indian trader, his home being at Prairie du Chien. In 1826\r\norders came to abandon the fort at Prairie du Chien. The soldiers were\r\ntransferred to Fort Snelling, but arms and ammunition were left in\r\ncharge of John Marsh, sub-Indian agent. Mr. Lockwood's family was the\r\nonly American family at the post. On June 25th of the ensuing year he\r\nleft for New York by the Wisconsin River route, Mrs. Lockwood\r\nremaining at home. The Winnebagoes were a little troublesome at this\r\ntime, the more so as the soldiers were removed from the post, but no\r\nserious disturbance was anticipated. The first night after leaving\r\nPrairie du Chien Mr. L. met some Winnebagoes, and all camped together\r\nfor the night; but the Indians, under their chief, Red Bird, left the\r\ncamp stealthily before morning, and, proceeding to Prairie du Chien,\r\nentered the house of Mr. Lockwood with loaded rifles. Mrs. L., greatly\r\nfrightened, fled to the store, then in charge of Duncan Graham, an old\r\nEnglish trader. The Indians followed Mrs. L. into the store. Graham\r\ncounseled with them and they left. As they were acting suspiciously a\r\nmessenger was sent after Mr. Lockwood in haste. He returned on the\r\ntwenty-seventh and found the inhabitants assembled, but without\r\nammunition or means of defense. The Indians told the people not to go\r\ninto the fort, as they would destroy it. As the day passed pickets and\r\nembankments were built around an old tavern. About sundown a keelboat\r\ncame down the river and landed, bearing three dead bodies and several\r\nwounded. The sides of the boat had been riddled by bullets. This\r\nghastly arrival increased the panic. Mr. Lockwood urged organization\r\nfor defense. He was selected as captain but declined, and Thomas\r\nMcNair was chosen, who ordered an immediate removal to the fort.\r\nRepairs were made and preparations for successful defense. On the day\r\nthe fighting commenced Red Bird and his companions shot and killed\r\nGagner and Lipcap. Mrs. Gagner, with rifle in hand, held Red Bird at\r\nbay till she escaped with one child into the rushes, whence she was\r\nrescued by a soldier on patrol duty. The soldier went to the house,\r\nwhere he found Gagner and Lipcap lying dead upon the floor, and an\r\ninfant child, scalped and with its throat cut, lying under the bed.\r\nGov. Cass, of Michigan, arrived on the fourth of July, greatly to the\r\nrelief of the besieged garrison, which he mustered into the service of\r\nthe United States, appointing Mr. Lockwood quartermaster. Another\r\ncompany, under Capt. Abner Field, was sent from Galena to their\r\nrelief. Mr. Lockwood sent a messenger to Col. Snelling at Fort\r\nSnelling, who promptly sent down a company in a keelboat. The force\r\nthus concentrated at the fort was sufficient to overcome the Indians,\r\nwho were in no plight to engage in a war with the United States. As\r\nthe result of a council held by the Winnebagoes in the presence of the\r\nofficers of the garrison, the Indians agreed to surrender Red Bird and\r\nKee-Waw to Maj. Whistler, the Indians asking that the prisoners should\r\nnot be ironed or harshly treated. Maj. Whistler promised that they\r\nshould be treated with consideration, and Red Bird, rising from the\r\nground, said, \"I am ready,\" and was marched off with his accomplice,\r\nKee-Waw, to a tent in the rear and placed under guard. The prisoners\r\nwere handed over to Gen. Atkinson, and given into the hands of the\r\ncivil authorities. They were chained and imprisoned, which so chafed\r\nthe proud spirit of Red Bird that he drooped and soon died of a broken\r\nheart. Kee-Waw was afterward pardoned by the president of the United\r\nStates. For this and other outrages perpetrated upon the settlers, not\r\na single Indian suffered the penalty of death, excepting Red Bird,\r\nwhose pride may be said to have been his executioner.\r\n\r\nMr. Lockwood continued in mercantile business at Prairie du Chien many\r\nyears. He held many positions of honor and trust, acquitting himself\r\nwith credit. He built the first saw mill north of the Wisconsin river,\r\non the Menomonie river. The famous Menomonie mills now occupy the same\r\nsite. A small mill had been commenced prior to this on Black river,\r\nbut the Indians had burned this mill before it was completed. Mr.\r\nLockwood died at his home, Aug. 24, 1867.\r\n\r\nJOHN S. LOCKWOOD.--John S., the brother of James H. Lockwood, was\r\nborn in 1796 in New York; came to Prairie du Chien in 1838, and\r\nthereafter engaged in merchandising. He was a man of exemplary habits\r\nand a member of the Presbyterian church most of his life. He raised an\r\ninteresting family. He died at his home at Prairie du Chien in 1858.\r\n\r\nSAMUEL GILBERT settled at Prairie du Chien in 1830. He was of Kentucky\r\nbirth, a blacksmith by trade, and a model man in habits. Mr. Gilbert,\r\nin 1842, became one of the proprietors of the Chippewa Falls mill. He\r\nafterward lived at Albany. He followed Mississippi river piloting,\r\nremoved to Burlington, Iowa, and died in 1878. Mr. Gilbert left four\r\nsons, Oliver, lumberman in Dunn county, Wisconsin, John and I. Dallam,\r\nlumber merchants at Burlington, Iowa, and Samuel.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL BRISBOIS.--We find the names of Brisbois and some others\r\nmentioned in the proceedings of the commission held by Col. Isaac Lee\r\nin 1820, to adjust claims to land in Prairie du Chien and vicinity.\r\nMichael Brisbois testified that he had been a resident of the Prairie\r\nthirty-nine years, which would date his settlement as far back as\r\n1781. Mr. Brisbois lived a stirring and eventful life. He died in\r\n1837, leaving several children. Joseph, the oldest, became a man of\r\nprominence and held many offices in state and church. Charles, the\r\nsecond son, while yet a boy went to McKenzie river, British\r\npossessions, in the employ of the Northwestern Fur Company, where he\r\nlived thirty years beyond the Arctic circle, and raised a large\r\nfamily. In 1842 he returned to Prairie du Chien, but his children,\r\nreared in the cold climate of the frozen zone, soon after his return\r\nsickened, and most of them died, unable to endure the change to a\r\nclimate so much milder. Bernard W., a third son, was born at Prairie\r\ndu Chien, Oct. 4, 1808. He was well educated and grew up a leading and\r\ninfluential citizen. As a child he had witnessed the taking of Fort\r\nShelby by the British in 1814, and its recapture as Fort McKay by the\r\nUnited States troops in 1815. During the Red Bird Indian war he served\r\nas second lieutenant, and for several years was stationed at Fort\r\nCrawford. He was also a prominent agent or confidential adviser in the\r\nfur company which had its headquarters at Prairie du Chien. He was\r\nsheriff of Crawford county and held the office of county treasurer and\r\nother positions of trust. In 1872 President Grant appointed him consul\r\nto Vernier, Belgium, but ill health compelled an early return. Mr.\r\nBrisbois married into the La Chapelle family. He died in 1885, leaving\r\nan interesting family.\r\n\r\nPIERRE LAPOINT was also before the commission of Col. Lee as an early\r\nresident, having lived at the Prairie since 1782. The testimony of\r\nthese early citizens served to establish the ancient tenure of the\r\nlands by French settlers, a tenure so ancient that no one could\r\ndefinitely give a date for its commencement. Mr. Lapoint was a farmer.\r\nHe reared a large family of children, and died about 1845.\r\n\r\nJOSEPH ROLETTE.--Joseph Rolette was at one time chief justice of the\r\ncounty court of Crawford county. He was of French descent and was born\r\nin Quebec, L. C., in 1787. He was educated for the Catholic\r\npriesthood. In 1804 he came to Prairie du Chien. In the early part of\r\nhis mature life he was an active and successful trader with the\r\nIndians on the Upper Mississippi. He was a man of keen perceptions and\r\nconsiderable ambition. He joined the British at the siege of Detroit,\r\nand was an officer at the capture of Mackinaw. He was in command of a\r\ncompany in the campaign of the British from Mackinaw to Prairie du\r\nChien, and aided in taking the American stockade. His early education\r\nand associations inclined him to espouse the British cause during the\r\nwar of 1812, which he did with all the ardor and enthusiasm of his\r\nnature. To his family he was kind and indulgent, giving his children\r\nthe best education possible. One daughter, married to Capt. Hoe, of\r\nthe United States army, was a very superior woman. One son, Joseph,\r\nreceived all the aid that money could give, and might have risen to\r\ndistinction, but he early contracted intemperate habits which became\r\nin later life tenaciously fixed. This son was at one time a member of\r\nthe Minnesota legislature. Joseph Rolette, Sr., died at Prairie du\r\nChien in 1842.\r\n\r\nHERCULES DOUSMAN.--The leading Indian trader of the Upper Mississippi,\r\nthe prominent adviser at Indian treaties and payments and the trusted\r\nagent of the American Fur Company, was Hercules Dousman, a keen,\r\nshrewd man, and universally influential with the Indians, with whom it\r\nmight be said his word was law. He understood all the intricacies\r\ninvolved in the Indian treaty and the half-breed annuities and\r\npayments. His extended favors and credits to the Indians, properly\r\nproven, of course, would be recognized and paid at the regular\r\npayments. He accumulated through these agencies great wealth, which\r\nhe retained to his dying day. He came to Prairie du Chien, in the\r\nemploy of Joseph Rolette, in 1828. He afterward married the widow of\r\nRolette. He died in Prairie du Chien in 1878.\r\n\r\nREV. DAVID LOWRY.--A noble, big hearted Kentuckian, a minister of the\r\nCumberland Presbyterian church, he was located by the government as\r\nfarmer and teacher of the Indians on Yellow river, near Prairie du\r\nChien, in 1833. For years this good man labored with unquestioned zeal\r\nfor the welfare of the untutored Indian. Mr. Lowry informed me, while\r\nat his post, that he was fearful that all his labor was labor lost, or\r\nworse than useless. The Indian pupil learned just enough to fit him\r\nfor the worst vices. The introduction of whisky was a corrupting\r\nagency, in itself capable of neutralizing every effort for the moral\r\nand intellectual advancement of the Indian, with whom intoxication\r\nproduces insanity. He felt quite disheartened as to the prospect of\r\naccomplishing any good. He died at St. Cloud some time in the '50s.\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE CHARLES DUNN.--When Wisconsin Territory was organized in\r\n1836, Charles Dunn was appointed chief justice. He served as judge\r\nuntil Wisconsin became a state in 1848. He was of Irish descent and\r\nwas born in Kentucky in 1799. He studied law in Kentucky and Illinois,\r\nand was admitted to practice in 1820 at Jonesboro, Illinois. He was\r\nchief clerk of the Illinois house of representatives five years. He\r\nwas one of the commissioners of the Illinois and Michigan canal. In\r\n1829 he was one of a party which surveyed and platted the first town\r\nof Chicago, and superintended the first sale of town lots there. He\r\nwas captain of a company during the Black Hawk War in 1832, and was\r\nseverely wounded through mistake by a sentinel on duty. In 1835 he was\r\na member of the Illinois house of representatives. In 1837, as judge,\r\nhe held his first court in Crawford county. In this court, in 1838,\r\nindictments were found against certain individuals for selling liquor\r\nto whites and Indians contrary to law, when, by evasions, continuances\r\nand technicalities, the suits would go by the board. In one case the\r\ncharge given to the jury by this dignified and courteous Judge Dunn\r\nwas as follows: \"Gentlemen of the Jury: Unless you are satisfied that\r\nthe defendants in this case did deal out, in clear, unadulterated\r\nquantities, intoxicating drinks, it is your imperative duty to\r\ndischarge them.\" The jury, of course, discharged the defendants.\r\nAside from his drinking habits, which interfered much with his\r\nusefulness, he was a genial gentleman and regarded by his associates\r\nas an eminent jurist. He sometimes kept the court waiting till he\r\nshould become sober, and on one occasion came near losing his life in\r\na drunken spree. He jumped through an upper window of Tainter's hotel,\r\nand escaped with only a broken leg. Judge Dunn was a member of the\r\nsecond Wisconsin constitutional convention. He was state senator in\r\n1853-4-5 and 6. He died at Mineral Point, April 7, 1872.\r\n\r\nREV. ALFRED BRUNSON, a distinguished pioneer preacher in the West, was\r\nborn in Connecticut, 1793, and received there a common school\r\neducation. His father died while he was yet a minor, and with\r\ncommendable zeal and filial love he devoted himself to providing for\r\nhis mother and her bereaved family, working at the trade of a\r\nshoemaker till he was seventeen years of age, when he enlisted as a\r\nsoldier under Gen. Harrison and served under him until the peace of\r\n1815, when he entered the Methodist ministry, in which, by industry\r\nand close application, he became quite learned and eminent as a\r\ndivine. His active ministry extended to the long period of sixty-seven\r\nyears. He was the first Methodist minister north of the Wisconsin\r\nriver. In 1837 he established a mission at Kaposia and thence removed\r\nto Red Rock (Newport), in Washington county, Minnesota. In 1840 he was\r\na member of the Wisconsin legislature. In 1842 he was Indian agent at\r\nLapointe, on Lake Superior. Mr. Brunson was very prominent in the\r\ncouncils of his own church, having represented his conference several\r\ntimes in the general conference of that body. He is also the author of\r\nmany essays and other publications, among them \"The Western Pioneer,\"\r\nin two volumes, a most entertaining and instructive account of life in\r\nthe West.\r\n\r\nMr. Brunson was married to Eunice Burr, a relative of the famous Aaron\r\nBurr. She was a woman of great intelligence and of excellent qualities\r\nof heart as well as mind. Her heart overflowed with sympathy for the\r\nsick and distressed, and she won by her care for them the affectionate\r\ntitle of \"Mother Brunson.\" She died in 1847.\r\n\r\nRev. Alfred Brunson, though an itinerant, was so favored in his\r\nvarious fields of labor that he was able to have his permanent home\r\nat Prairie du Chien, where he lived from 1835 until the time of his\r\ndeath in 1882.\r\n\r\nMany incidents in Mr. Brunson's career are worthy of permanent record.\r\nHe was among the most hardy and daring of the pioneers. He came down\r\nthe Ohio and up the Mississippi in a barge to Prairie du Chien in\r\n1835, the barge laden with household furniture and the material for a\r\nframe building which, on landing, he proceeded immediately to erect.\r\nThis house, which he and his family occupied till his death, is still\r\nstanding.\r\n\r\nWhen he established his mission at Kaposia he was greatly in need of\r\nan interpreter. An officer at Fort Snelling owned a negro slave who\r\nhad been a Methodist before going into the army in the service of his\r\nmaster. Afterward he had married a Dakota woman and by associating\r\nwith the Indians had learned their language. This young negro, James\r\nThompson, was a slave, and Mr. Brunson could only secure his services\r\nby purchasing him outright, which he did, paying the price of $1,200,\r\nthe money for which was raised by subscription in Ohio. \"Jim\" was\r\npresented with his \"free papers,\" and was soon interpreting the Gospel\r\nto the Indians at Kaposia. This is the only instance on record of a\r\nslave being sold on Minnesota soil. It will be remembered, however,\r\nthat the historical \"DRED SCOTT\" was also the property of an officer\r\nat the Fort, Surgeon Emerson. James Thompson resided in St. Paul in\r\nthe later years of his life, and died there in 1884.\r\n\r\nIRA BRUNSON.--Ira, the eldest son of Rev. A. Brunson, was born in Ohio\r\nin 1815, and came to Prairie du Chien in 1836. He was a member of the\r\nlegislature during the years 1837-38-39 and 40. He was also postmaster\r\nmany years. He was continuously in office in Crawford county until his\r\ndeath in 1884. In 1840 he was appointed special deputy United States\r\nmarshal for the purpose of removing the settlers from the Fort\r\nSnelling reservation. These settlers were mostly from Selkirk,\r\nManitoba. They had been driven out by the grasshoppers and, fleeing\r\nsouthward, had settled about Fort Snelling to be under the protection\r\nof the Fort. The government, however, considered them intruders and\r\nordered Mr. Brunson to remove them outside the reservation, and to\r\ndestroy all their dwellings and farm improvements, which disagreeable\r\nduty he performed as well, perhaps, as it could be performed; he, as\r\nhe afterward told me, being satisfied in his own mind that the\r\nremoval would be for their ultimate good, the influences of the Fort\r\nand of the associations of the motley crowd of hangers on around it\r\nbeing somewhat demoralizing. At any rate the eviction of these western\r\nAcadians has never aroused the sympathies of the poet and\r\nsentimentalist as did that of the Acadians of the East.\r\n\r\nJOHN H. FOLSOM, brother of W. H. C. Folsom, was born in Machias,\r\nMaine, Dec. 27, 1813. He was engaged during his youth in clerking. In\r\n1835 he made a voyage as supercargo of a vessel to the Congo coast. In\r\n1836 he came to Michigan, and in 1837 to Prairie du Chien, where he\r\nhas since continuously resided. He was married in 1839 to Angelica\r\nPion, who died in 1878, leaving no children. He has a very retentive\r\nmemory, and is quoted as an authority in the local history of Prairie\r\ndu Chien. The writer is indebted to him for many particulars referring\r\nto the early history of that city.\r\n\r\nEZEKIEL TAINTER.--Mr. Tainter came to Prairie du Chien in 1833 from\r\nVermont. He had at first fort contracts, but afterward engaged in\r\nmerchandising, farming and hotel keeping. He also served as sheriff.\r\nHe was eccentric and original in his methods, and some amusing stories\r\nare told of his prowess in arresting criminals. On one occasion he was\r\nabout to arrest a criminal. Having summoned his _posse_, he followed\r\nthe man until he took refuge in a cabin with one door and two windows.\r\nStationing his men before the door, he thus addressed them: \"Brave\r\nboys, I am about to go through this door. If I fall, as I undoubtedly\r\nwill, you must rush over my dead body and seize the ruffian.\" Giving\r\nthe word of command, he plunged through the door and captured the\r\ncriminal, apparently much astonished at finding himself still alive.\r\nAt his tavern, one morning, a boarder announced that he had been\r\nrobbed. Uncle Zeke quieted him, and, quickly examining his rooms,\r\nfound one boarder missing. It was gray twilight. He ordered all to\r\nretire but the man who had been robbed. The two sat quietly down as\r\nthey saw a man approaching the house from the bluffs. To their\r\nsurprise it was the absentee approaching. As he stepped on the piazza,\r\nUncle Zeke dexterously tripped him up with his stiff leg, and seizing\r\nhim by the throat, shouted to the astonished miscreant: \"Where is the\r\nmoney you stole? Tell me at once, or you will never get up.\" The\r\nprostrate culprit, thoroughly frightened, tremblingly answered, \"I\r\nhid it in the bluff.\" They marched him to the spot, recovered the\r\nmoney and generously allowed the thief his freedom on the condition of\r\nhis leaving the country. Uncle Zeke lived to a good old age, and died\r\nat the residence of his son Andrew, in Menomonie, Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nWYRAM KNOWLTON.--Mr. Knowlton was born in Chenango county, New York,\r\nin 1816, came to Wisconsin in 1837, and commenced the study of law. He\r\nwas admitted to practice in Platteville, and in 1840 came to Prairie\r\ndu Chien and opened a law office. In 1846 he enlisted and served in\r\nthe Mexican War, after which he resumed practice. In 1850 he was\r\nappointed judge of the Sixth Judicial district of Wisconsin, and\r\nserved six years. He held the first court in Pierce county in 1854. He\r\nwas a man of fine ability. He died in the north part of the State in\r\n1873.\r\n\r\nROBERT LESTER.--A melancholy interest attaches to the memory of this\r\nman on account of his early tragical death. He had come to Prairie du\r\nChien in 1840, and in 1842 had been elected sheriff. Next year his\r\nofficial duties called him to the Menomonie and Chippewa valleys. On\r\nhis return he had left Lockwood's mills on the Menomonie, and had\r\npassed through Trempealeau and was coasting along the west shore, when\r\nan Indian hailed him, calling for bread. Lester passed on without\r\nresponding. As he reached a point of land the Indian ran across the\r\npoint and, awaiting his approach, shot him through the heart. Lester\r\nrose as the ball struck him, and fell overboard. Mr. Jean Bruno,\r\nproprietor of the Chippewa mills, was on his way up river in a canoe,\r\nand witnessed the whole transaction. Mr. Bruno described the whole\r\ntragic scene. Popular excitement ran high at Prairie du Chien. A party\r\nof men volunteered to search for Lester's body, which was found at the\r\nplace of the murder and brought back for interment at Prairie du\r\nChien. The Indian, a Sioux, was arrested and kept in jail a long time,\r\nand although he had acknowledged to some of his Indian friends that he\r\nhad killed Lester, he was acquitted. It was a cold blooded and\r\natrocious murder, and the proof of the Indian's guilt was\r\noverwhelming, as he was, by his own confession, the murderer; still he\r\nwas not punished. In this case the prisoner did not languish and die\r\nin jail of a broken heart as did Red Bird, the murderer of Gagner and\r\nLipcap. As a rule the courts dealt very leniently with Indian\r\ncriminals.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS PENDLETON BURNETT was born in Virginia in 1800. He studied law\r\nand was admitted to the bar in Paris, Kentucky. He was appointed\r\nsub-Indian agent under J. M. Street, in 1829. He came to Prairie du\r\nChien in 1830 and entered upon the duties of the agency. He also\r\npracticed law. In 1835 he was a member of the Michigan territorial\r\ncouncil and its president. In 1836, after his term of office expired,\r\nhe married a daughter of Alfred Brunson and, continuing the practice\r\nof law, became quite eminent for his skill, and acquired an extensive\r\npractice. He was a fluent speaker, well skilled in the management of\r\nthe cases intrusted to his care. In 1840 he removed to a farm at Patch\r\nGrove, Grant county. He was a member of the Wisconsin constitutional\r\nconvention which met in 1846. He served but a few weeks when he was\r\ncalled home by the death of his mother and the sickness of his wife.\r\nThe fatigue of a twenty-four hours' ride of eighty-five miles in a\r\nrude lumber wagon was too much for his not very rugged constitution,\r\nand four days after his mother's death he followed her to the world of\r\nspirits. His devoted wife survived him but three hours. Under\r\ncircumstances of such unusual sadness did this brilliant and promising\r\nlawyer and citizen take his departure from earth. His death created a\r\nprofound sensation throughout the entire Northwest, where he was so\r\nwell and favorably known.\r\n\r\nHENRY DODGE, the first governor of Wisconsin Territory, was born in\r\nVincennes, Indiana, Oct. 12, 1782. He came to the lead mines of\r\nWisconsin in 1828. In 1832 he took part in the Black Hawk War, an\r\nuprising of the Sac and Fox Indians against the United States\r\ngovernment. Mr. Dodge participated as a general at the battle of Bad\r\nAxe, his regiment occupying the front rank in that battle. April 30,\r\n1836, he was appointed governor of Wisconsin by President Andrew\r\nJackson, reappointed in 1839 by President Van Buren, and by President\r\nPolk in 1845, serving three terms. From 1841 to 1845, during the\r\npresidency of Harrison and his successor (Tyler), he served as\r\nterritorial delegate to Congress. In 1848 he was elected United States\r\nsenator for the short term, and re-elected in 1851, Senator Walker\r\nbeing his colleague. On the occasion of the motion to admit\r\nCalifornia, the Wisconsin senators were instructed by the legislature\r\nto vote against the measure. Senator Walker disregarded the\r\ninstruction and voted for the measure. Senator Dodge, although\r\nextremely ill at the time, had himself carried to the senate chamber\r\nthat he might record his vote adversely to the bill. Gov. Dodge rose\r\nto the highest position in his State, and chiefly by his own unaided\r\nefforts. As a soldier he was brave and efficient, as a governor,\r\ncongressional delegate and senator he was clear headed, cautious and\r\nwise, and altogether a citizen of whom the State might justly be\r\nproud. He died in Burlington, Iowa, June 19, 1867.\r\n\r\nGEORGE W. JONES was born in Vincennes, Indiana. He graduated at\r\nTransylvania University, Kentucky, in 1825. He was educated for the\r\nlaw, but ill health prevented him from practicing. He, however, served\r\nas clerk of the United States district court in Missouri in 1826, and\r\nduring the Black Hawk War served as aid-de-camp to Gen. Dodge. In 1832\r\nhe was appointed colonel of militia, and was promoted to a major\r\ngeneralship. After the war he served as judge of a county court. In\r\n1835 he was elected delegate to Congress from the territory of\r\nMichigan, or from that part of it lying west of Lake Michigan, and\r\nremained a delegate until the formation of Wisconsin Territory, in\r\n1836, when he was elected delegate from the new territory. In 1839 he\r\nwas appointed surveyor general for Wisconsin. He was removed in 1841,\r\nbut reappointed by President Polk, and continued in office until\r\nelected senator from the state of Iowa, which position he held for six\r\nyears, and was then appointed by President Buchanan minister to New\r\nGranada. During the Civil War his sympathies were with the South and\r\nhe was imprisoned for awhile at Fort Warren under a charge of\r\ndisloyalty. He has resided in Dubuque, Iowa, since the formation of\r\nIowa Territory. He still lives, a hale and hearty old gentleman, and\r\nserved as a delegate to the waterways convention held in St. Paul,\r\nSeptember, 1880.\r\n\r\nS. G. AND S. L. TAINTER AND JOHN THOMAS (father of Hon. Ormsby Thomas,\r\nrepresentative from Wisconsin in the Congress of 1887-88) with their\r\nfamilies came to Prairie du Chien in 1837. The Messrs. Tainter and\r\nThomas died many years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nSTILLWATER AND ST. CROIX COUNTY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn September, 1844, reluctantly I bade adieu to Prairie du Chien with\r\nits picturesque bluffs and historic associations, and embarked on the\r\nsteamer Highland Mary, Capt. Atchison, to seek a home and more\r\nsalubrious climate further north. The voyage was without incident\r\nworthy of note, till we reached St. Croix lake, in the midst of a\r\ncrashing thunder storm and a deluge of rain, which did not prevent us\r\nfrom eagerly scanning the scenery of the lake. The shores were as yet\r\nalmost without inhabitants. The home of Paul Carli, a two story house\r\nat the mouth of Bolles creek, was the first dwelling above Prescott,\r\non the west side of the lake. A few French residences were to be seen\r\nabove on the west side. On the east bank, below the mouth of Willow\r\nriver, where Hudson is now situated, were three log houses owned by\r\nPeter Bouchea, Joseph Manesse, and Louis Massey. On the high hill\r\nwest, nearly opposite Willow river, stood the farm house of Elam\r\nGreely, and on the same side, on the point, in full view of\r\nStillwater, stood the farm house of John Allen. With the exception of\r\nthese few dwellings, the shores of the lake were untouched by the hand\r\nof man, and spread before us in all their primitive beauty. There were\r\ngently rounded hills sloping to the water's edge, and crowned with\r\ngroves of shrubby oak, amidst which, especially at the outlet of\r\nstreams into the lake, the darker pines stood out boldly against the\r\nsky. We passed on over the clear, blue expanse of water on which was\r\nno floating thing save our boat and the wild fowl which were scared\r\nand flew away at our approach, till we reached the head of the lake at\r\nStillwater, the end of our journey. November 30th my family arrived on\r\nthe steamer Cecilia, Capt. Throckmorton.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTILLWATER IN 1845.\r\n\r\nWe landed just in front of the store of nelson & co. just below the\r\nlanding was a clear, cold spring, bubbling out of the earth, or the\r\nrock rather. It was walled in and pretty well filled with speckled\r\ntrout. On the opposite side of the street Walter R. Vail had a house\r\nand store; north of Vail's store the house and store of Socrates\r\nNelson. Up Main street, west side, stood Anson Northrup's hotel and\r\nGreely & Blake's post office and store. One street back was the\r\nresidence of John E. Mower, and north of this the mill boarding house,\r\nand in the rear the shanty store of the mill company, where the Sawyer\r\nHouse now stands. Up a ravine stood the shanty residence of John\r\nSmith. In a ravine next to Nelson & Co.'s store was the residence of\r\nWm. Cove. On Main street, opposite Greely & Blake's store, was the\r\nresidence of Albert Harris. On the shore of the lake, north of\r\nChestnut street, was John McKusick's saw mill. Sylvester Stateler's\r\nblacksmith shop stood just south of the mill. In Brown's Dakotah, now\r\nSchulenberg's addition, near the old log court house, was a log hotel,\r\nkept by Robert Kennedy. This was Stillwater in 1845.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. CROIX COUNTY.\r\n\r\nFrom 1819 to 1836 this valley was under the jurisdiction of Crawford\r\ncounty, Michigan, there being no white inhabitants save Indian\r\ntraders. There was no law dispensed in this region, excepting the law\r\nthat might makes right. In 1836 the territory of Wisconsin, comprising\r\nall of Michigan west of the great lakes; also all that portion of\r\nMissouri Territory out of which was formed the state of Iowa, which\r\nwas organized as a territory in 1838, and admitted as a state in 1846;\r\nalso that portion of Minnesota which lies west of the present\r\nstate--yet unorganized--known as Dakota, was organized.\r\n\r\nThe year 1837 forms a new era in our history. Gov. Henry Dodge, of\r\nWisconsin, on the part of the national government, was appointed to\r\nnegotiate with the Ojibways. They met at Fort Snelling. A treaty was\r\nmade, the Indians ceding to the United States all their lands east of\r\nthe Mississippi, to near the headwaters of the St. Croix and Chippewa\r\nrivers.\r\n\r\nA deputation of Dakotas at Washington, the same year, ceded all their\r\nlands east of the Mississippi to the parent government, thus opening\r\nto settlement all this portion of Minnesota and Wisconsin. But few\r\nadventurers made their way into this far off region, however, for many\r\nyears. A steamer once in two months was the only mode of travel,\r\nexcepting by birch canoe.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1837, at Prairie du Chien, I met a party who had ascended\r\nthe Mississippi and the St. Croix as far as St. Croix Falls. According\r\nto their account they had found the place where creation ended, where\r\na large river, capable of bearing a steamer, burst out of a rock like\r\nthat which Moses smote. They had seen \"the elephant with his quills\r\nerect,\" and were returning satisfied to their New England home. They\r\nhad entered the since famous Dalles of the St. Croix, located at the\r\nhead of navigation on that river.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1838, being the year succeeding the purchase of the lands\r\nbordering on the St. Croix river and a portion of her tributaries, may\r\nbe dated the commencement of the settlement of the St. Croix valley;\r\nbut with the exception of the Hon. Joseph R. Brown, the parties that I\r\nshall enumerate as opening business, came here for the purpose of\r\nlumbering, and in no instance as permanent settlers. The valley was\r\nconsidered too far north and the soil too sterile for cultivation, but\r\nmany of those who came here in 1838 found out their mistake and made\r\nchoice of the valley for their permanent homes. They were afterward\r\nabundantly satisfied with the healthfulness of the climate and the\r\nfertility of the soil. Several companies were formed this year for the\r\nostensible purpose of lumbering, many members of which became\r\npermanent settlers.\r\n\r\nThe first dismemberment of the St. Croix valley from Crawford county\r\nwas by the organization of the county of St. Croix. Joseph R. Brown\r\nwas elected representative to the legislature, from the north part of\r\nCrawford county. His residence at that time was Gray Cloud, now in\r\nWashington county. Mr. Brown introduced the bill for the organization\r\nof St. Croix county, which passed and was approved by the governor of\r\nWisconsin, Jan. 9, 1840. The writer of these sketches was employed by\r\nMessrs. Brown and Brunson (the representatives from this district), in\r\nDecember, 1839, to take them with a team from Prairie du Chien to\r\nMadison. One of the indispensable requirements for traveling in those\r\ndays was a large \"Black Betty,\" which was the butt of much wit and\r\nhumor. Mr. Brown said the contents of Old Betty must establish a new\r\ncounty away up in the Northwest. The deed was done--the act did pass.\r\nI don't know whether Old Betty came back to assist in organizing the\r\ncounty or not. It is well to say Mr. Brown acquitted himself with\r\nhonor to his constituents, and was successful in the one great object\r\nfor which he sought the election. This was the precursor to coming\r\nevents--a shadow cast before. For it was under this organization that\r\nNorthwest Wisconsin and Minnesota first obeyed the mandates of law and\r\norder.\r\n\r\nUnder the provision of the act of organization, Hazen Mooers, of Gray\r\nCloud, Samuel Burkelo, of Marine, and Joseph R. Brown, of Dakotah,\r\nwere constituted a board of county commissioners with county seat\r\nlocated at Dakotah.\r\n\r\nThis town was located at the head of Lake St. Croix, on the west side,\r\non unsurveyed government lands, known as \"Joe Brown's Claim.\" When the\r\nWisconsin legislature of 1840 made this the county seat of St. Croix\r\ncounty it was named Dakotah.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUDGE IRWIN'S COURT IN 1840.\r\n\r\nThe first district court north of Prairie du Chien was called at\r\nDakotah, St. Croix county. This county had been assigned to Judge\r\nIrwin's district (Green Bay). The time assigned for the court was\r\nJune, 1840. Judge Irwin wended his way up Fox river to the portage,\r\ndown the Wisconsin to Prairie du Chien, up the Mississippi to St.\r\nPaul, and across from St. Paul to Dakotah with guides. At Dakotah the\r\nregular officers were all absent, but he found at the court house two\r\nyoung men named Brown and six Frenchmen from St. Paul and Little\r\nCanada, summoned as jurors by Sheriff Lawrence. Judge Irwin remained\r\none night, slept in deer skins in the county building, subsisting\r\nmeanwhile on venison and bear steak. No calendar was to be found and\r\nthe judge and jurors left for home.\r\n\r\nThe first commissioners' meeting was held Oct. 5, 1840. At this\r\nmeeting much important work was done. An acre of ground at the county\r\nseat was selected for county buildings. A contract to erect a court\r\nhouse according to specifications was let to J. R. Brown, he to\r\nreceive for the same eight hundred dollars. The parties agreed upon a\r\ndeed or conveyance of ground, a synopsis of which we append. The\r\nconveyance cites and reiterates a Wisconsin legislative law\r\nestablishing St. Croix county, giving to the people the right to\r\nlocate the county seat by vote and to the county commissioners power\r\nto erect county buildings, the selected location to be the permanent\r\nseat of justice of said county. It further provides that the county\r\ncommissioners shall carry into effect the law of Congress of the\r\nUnited States, entitled \"An act granting to counties or parishes, in\r\nwhich public lands are situate, the right of pre-emption to one-fourth\r\nsection of land, for seats of justice within the same.\" Approved May\r\n20, 1824. It then cites the vote taken Aug. 5, 1840, locating the\r\ncounty seat at \"Brown's warehouse, at the head of Lake St. Croix.\"\r\nFurther conditions are set forth in compliance with the law,\r\nconfirming the location on Joseph R. Brown's land claim. This is the\r\nfirst recorded deed in St. Croix county.\r\n\r\nThirty dollars was allowed to J. R. Brown and W. B. Dibble, each, for\r\ncarrying election returns to Prairie du Chien. The first abstract of\r\nvotes polled in St. Croix county was for delegate to Congress and for\r\ncounty officers. For delegate to Congress the following vote was cast:\r\nHenry Dodge, seventeen; Jonathan E. Arnold, ten. Samuel Burkelo, Hazen\r\nMooers and W. B. Dibble were elected county commissioners; William\r\nHolcombe, county treasurer and register of deeds; Phineas Lawrence,\r\nsheriff; J. R. Brown, county clerk and clerk of court, and Philander\r\nPrescott, assessor.\r\n\r\nThe first recorded deed of property in Stillwater was from Walter R.\r\nVail to Rufus S. King, transferring for a consideration of $1,550 a\r\ntract bounded east by Lake St. Croix and south and north by lands\r\nowned by Churchill and Nelson.\r\n\r\nThree election precincts had been established in this portion of\r\nCrawford county prior to the organization of St. Croix county:\r\nCaw-caw-baw-kank, embracing the county adjacent to St. Croix Falls;\r\nDakotah, the county at the head of Lake St. Croix, and Chan-wak-an the\r\nGray Cloud settlement, on the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nOn July 5, 1841, the commissioners held a meeting and established\r\nvoting precincts as follows:\r\n\r\n_Gray Cloud_--Judges of election, Hazen Mooers, David Howe, Joseph\r\nHaskell.\r\n\r\n_Mouth of St. Croix Lake_--Judges of election, P. Prescott, Oscar P.\r\nBurris, John Burke.\r\n\r\n_Marine Mills_--Judges of election, Asa Parker, Samuel Burkelo, T.\r\nHarrington.\r\n\r\n_Falls of St. Croix_--Judges of election, Joseph W. Furber, Joshua L.\r\nTaylor, Jesse Taylor.\r\n\r\n_Pokegama_--Judges of election, Jeremiah Russell, E. Myers, E. L. Ely.\r\n\r\nFeb. 2, 1844, St. Paul and Stillwater were made election precincts by\r\nthe Wisconsin legislature, and Stillwater was made the county seat.\r\nThe constituted authorities were not successful in making out\r\nassessments and collecting county revenues. The first estimate of\r\nexpenditures for the county was for 1842, and amounted to $482. This\r\nincluded the estimate for holding one term of court. Up to the time of\r\nchanging the county seat to Stillwater much dissatisfaction existed as\r\nto the manner in which the county finances had been managed, and there\r\nwas a general revolt, a refusal to pay taxes. In consequence, the\r\ncounty building at Dakotah remained unfinished and was finally\r\nabandoned by the county authorities. J. R. Brown lost on his contract\r\non account of this failure and abandonment. The first successful\r\ncollection of taxes in St. Croix county, considered legal, was in\r\n1845. Capt. Wm. Holcombe acted during this period as clerk of the\r\ncommissioners, and register of deeds. In 1846 he deputized W. H. C.\r\nFolsom as deputy clerk and register of deeds, and transmitted the\r\nrecords from St. Croix Falls to Stillwater.\r\n\r\n[A]\r\nEARLY HISTORY OF STILLWATER.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1843 Jacob Fisher made a claim on unsurveyed lands at\r\nthe head of Lake St. Croix, immediately south of Dakotah, spotting and\r\nblazing the trees to mark the limits of his claim. Mr. Fisher thought\r\nit a good site for a saw mill, and made an offer to Elias McKean and\r\nCalvin F. Leach of the entire claim on condition that they would build\r\na mill. McKusick and Greely were looking for a mill site; Mr. Fisher\r\nreferred them to McKean and Leach. It was agreed that the four should\r\ntake the claim and erect the mill. Greely improved and held the\r\nclaim, while McKusick went to St. Louis and procured mill irons and\r\nsupplies. McKean and Leach operated in the pinery. By April 1, 1844,\r\nthe mill was finished and in operation. This was the first frame\r\nbuilding erected in Stillwater. It stood on the lake shore, east of\r\nMain street, lot 8, block 18. The second frame building was McKusick's\r\nboarding house, west of Main street, on block 18. John Allen's family\r\nwas the first to locate in Stillwater. Mr. Allen came in the spring of\r\n1844, and subsequently removed to California. The second family was\r\nthat of Anson Northrup coming soon after. Mr. Northrup built a public\r\nhouse on the west side of Main street, just north of Nelson's alley.\r\nSoon afterward came widow Edwards and family from Ohio, relatives of\r\nthe Northrups; Mrs. Northrup being a daughter of widow Edwards.\r\nSocrates Nelson came about this time and built the first store in\r\nStillwater. His family joined him soon afterward. The first marriage\r\nwas that of Jesse Taylor and Abbie Edwards, J. W. Furber, Esq.,\r\nofficiating justice. The second marriage was that of William Cove to\r\nNancy Edwards in May, 1845. The first white child born was Willie\r\nTaylor, son of Jesse Taylor, in 1845. A daughter, Maud Maria, was born\r\nto Mr. and Mrs. Paul Carli in Dakotah (Schulenburg's addition to\r\nStillwater), in 1843.\r\n\r\nStillwater derives its name from its appropriate location on the banks\r\nof the still waters of Lake St. Croix. A post office was established\r\nin 1845, and Elam Greely was appointed postmaster. The first business\r\npartnership was that of the saw mill company, already noted. We give\r\nhere in full the articles of agreement as the first written and the\r\noldest on record in Washington county. This document is important not\r\nonly as fixing a date for the origin or founding of Stillwater, but as\r\nan important event, as it thus early laid the foundation of the future\r\nprosperity of the city, and indicated the direction in which its\r\nenergies should be chiefly turned:\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Copy of Agreement._]\r\n\r\nThis agreement, made and entered into this twenty-sixth day of\r\nOctober, Anno Domini eighteen hundred and forty-three, by the\r\nfollowing named individuals, viz.: John McKusick, Elias McKean, Elam\r\nGreely, and Calvin F. Leach, for the purpose of building a saw mill\r\nnear the head of Lake St. Croix, Wisconsin Territory, and for carrying\r\non the lumbering business in all its various branches.\r\n\r\n_Article first_--It is understood by this agreement, that the\r\nheretofore named individuals form themselves into a company to\r\ncontinue and exist by the name of the Stillwater Lumber Company.\r\n\r\n_Article second_--It is agreed to by the heretofore named individuals,\r\nthat the whole amount of property owned and business done by the\r\naforesaid company shall be included in fifteen shares, and to be\r\ndivided and owned by each individual of the aforesaid company as\r\nfollows, viz.: John McKusick, five-fifteenths; Elias McKean,\r\nthree-fifteenths; Elam Greely, four-fifteenths; and Calvin F. Leach,\r\nthree-fifteenths.\r\n\r\n_Article third_--It is furthermore understood, that each proprietor of\r\nthe aforesaid company shall pay his proportion of all the expenses\r\narising from all the business done or transacted by the aforesaid\r\ncompany, and to continue the same ratio, so long a time as said\r\ncompany shall exist and continue to do business under the present\r\nform, and likewise any gain or loss, arising or accruing from any or\r\nall of the business done by the aforesaid company, shall be shared or\r\nsustained by each proprietor of the aforesaid company, in the same\r\nratio as above named, in proportion to each above named proprietor's\r\nshare of stock owned in the aforesaid company.\r\n\r\n_Article fourth_--It is furthermore agreed to, that the whole amount\r\nof money or property that each or either of the proprietors of the\r\naforesaid company shall invest, advance, or pay for the benefit or use\r\nof the aforesaid company, the same amount shall be credited to the\r\nseparate credit of the proprietor or either of the proprietors of the\r\naforesaid company making such investments, on the books of accounts\r\nkept by the aforesaid company.\r\n\r\n_Article fifth_--It is furthermore understood, that for the amount of\r\nmoney or property that any one of the proprietors of the aforesaid\r\ncompany shall invest, advance, or pay for the benefit or use of the\r\naforesaid company, more than his proportional share of the whole\r\namount of money or property invested by the aforesaid company, the\r\nsame amount of money, with interest, shall be paid or refunded back to\r\nsaid proprietor by the aforesaid company, out of the first proceeds\r\narising from the business done by the company aforesaid.\r\n\r\n_Article sixth_--It is furthermore understood, that in case any one of\r\nthe aforesaid proprietors should at any time hereafter be disposed to\r\nsell, transfer or dispose of his share of stock owned in the aforesaid\r\ncompany, he shall first pay to said company all the liabilities or\r\nindebtedness of said share of stock, and then give said company the\r\npreference of purchasing and owning said share of stock, at the same\r\nrates by which said proprietor may have an opportunity to sell said\r\nshares of stock.\r\n\r\n_Article seventh_--It is furthermore understood that the proprietors\r\nof the aforesaid company, individually, shall have no right, or power,\r\nto sign any obligation or due bill, make any contract, or transact any\r\nbusiness of importance in the name of, or binding on, the aforesaid\r\ncompany, except some one proprietor of the aforesaid company should\r\nhereafter be fully authorized by the aforesaid company to act and\r\ntransact business as agent for the aforesaid company.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof, we hereunto set our hands and seals this\r\ntwenty-sixth day of October, Anno Domini eighteen hundred and\r\nforty-three.\r\n\r\nJOHN MCKUSICK,\r\nELAM GREELY,\r\nELIAS MCKEAN,\r\nC. F. LEACH.\r\n\r\nAttest: C. SIMONDS.\r\n\r\nThis agreement and dates are taken from the original book of records\r\nin the possession of John McKusick.\r\n\r\nAfter this agreement was signed, until Mr. McKusick became the sole\r\nowner, the business was conducted by mutual agreement, there being no\r\nconstituted agent, except in case of an emergency.\r\n\r\nThe mill boarding house, a two story building, erected in 1845, was\r\nburned in 1846, and immediately rebuilt. In 1846 J. H. Brewster built\r\na small store. McKusick's store was built the same year, on the\r\nsouthwest corner of Main and Myrtle streets. Some smaller buildings\r\nwere erected this year.\r\n\r\nIn 1845 a verbal agreement was made with regard to land claims, by\r\nwhich Brown's claim was recognized as extending along the lake shore\r\nnorth of Battle Hollow, where the Minnesota state prison now stands.\r\nSouth of Battle Hollow, along the lake shore to Nelson, extending\r\nthree-fourths of a mile west, was the claim of the mill company,\r\noriginally held by Fisher. South of Nelson's alley, one-half mile down\r\nthe lake, three-fourths of a mile west, was S. Nelson's claim. When\r\nthe government survey was made these claims and lines were amicably\r\nadjusted and confirmed. A congressional law was in existence making\r\nprovisions for villages and cities built on unsurveyed lands, that\r\nsuch lands should be equitably divided and surveyed into lots, and the\r\nactual settler or occupant should be protected in his rights.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1846, a desire was expressed by citizens of St. Paul and\r\nStillwater for the opening of new roads between these cities. The\r\ntraveled road up to that time was by Haskell's and Bissell's Mounds.\r\nLouis Roberts and the writer examined a route by White Bear lake. A\r\nroad was established south of this route in June.\r\n\r\nIn July I started up the St. Croix river with Joseph Brewster, in a\r\nbatteau, to put up hay for Elam Greely on Kanabec river. We poled our\r\nbatteau with outfit and camped where now stands the village of\r\nFranconia. The next morning early we entered the picturesque Dalles of\r\nthe St. Croix, then cordelled our boat over Baker's falls, and landed\r\nat the village of St. Croix Falls. This village, the first American\r\nsettlement on the St. Croix, had one large mill with six saws. The\r\nwater power was utilized by means of a permanent dam with massive\r\npiers. A warehouse was perched in a romantic situation amidst the\r\ncliffs of the Dalles and furnished with a tramway or wooden railway\r\nextending to the summit of the cliffs, for the transportation of\r\ngoods. A boarding house dubbed the \"Barlow House,\" another the \"Soap\r\nGrease Exchange,\" and a few small tenement houses, constituted the\r\nvillage. The leading business men were James Purinton, Wm. Holcombe,\r\nJoseph Bowron and Lewis Barlow. We spent half a day in making a\r\nportage around the St. Croix falls. The wind being fair, on the third\r\nday we sailed as far as Sunrise island. At Wolf creek we passed an\r\nIndian trading post. In front of Sunrise island and on the west side\r\nof the St. Croix river, a little below the mouth of Sunrise river,\r\nstood the trading post of Maurice M. Samuels, long known as one of the\r\nmost remarkable and notorious men on the frontier. He was a Jew, but\r\nhad married a Chippewa woman, claiming that he had married one of his\r\nown people, the Indians being, according to his theory, descendants of\r\nthe Lost Tribes of Israel.\r\n\r\nOn the sixth day we came to the farm of Jeremiah Russell, on Pokegama\r\nlake. We found him a pleasant gentleman, engaged as an Indian farmer.\r\nWe paddled across the lake to the Presbyterian mission. Mr. Boutwell,\r\nthe superintendent, was absent. The mission was pleasantly located,\r\nthe management was excellent, the crops were in fair condition, and\r\nwell cultivated. Everything about the mission betokened good\r\nmanagement. Next day we went to a hay meadow opposite the mouth of\r\nGround House creek, where we put up on this and adjacent meadows sixty\r\ntons of hay. We left on the twenty-fourth, camping the first night at\r\nChengwatana. On the morning of the twenty-fifth, while passing down\r\nKanabec river, our ears were greeted with some most horrible and\r\nunearthly noises. On turning a bend in the river we saw a large body\r\nof Indians cutting indescribable antics, in the river and on the\r\nshore, chasing each other, reeling and staggering to and fro, yelling\r\nand firing guns. They seemed a lot of Bedlamites turned out as if to\r\ndispute our passage down the river. Pass them now we must. It was too\r\nlate to retreat. Our batteau was light. I was in the bow, Brewster was\r\nin the stern. The yelling and uproar grew each moment more horrible.\r\nBrewster said: \"Keep the bow in the best water and pass them in a\r\nhurry.\" He was of great strength; every set of his pole would almost\r\nlift the boat from the water. While we were passing several guns were\r\nleveled at us, but such was the noise that if any were fired we did\r\nnot hear them. We were glad when we passed out of range and hearing.\r\nWhile passing we caught a glimpse of the cause of the unusual\r\ndisturbance, some whisky barrels, and drunken savages around them,\r\nstaggering, fighting or lying on the ground in drunken stupor. Landing\r\nat Samuels' camp, we learned of him that one Myers had hidden a couple\r\nof barrels of whisky on Kanabec river, that the Indians had found\r\nthem, and the jollification we had witnessed would last till the\r\nwhisky was all gone. We arrived at Stillwater without further\r\nadventure.\r\n\r\nIn July I made another visit to Prairie du Chien. The mail packet for\r\nFort Snelling, on which I expected to return, broke her shaft and\r\nreturned to St. Louis for repairs. The postmaster at Prairie du Chien\r\noffered me seventy dollars to carry the mail to the Fort, which offer\r\nI accepted. I bought a skiff, blankets and provisions, hired one man\r\nand started. We poled, paddled and rowed against a strong current, the\r\nlow water compelling us to keep near the centre of the river. We\r\narrived at Bully Wells' on Lake Pepin on the fifth evening and\r\npolitely asked the privilege of stopping with him and were promptly\r\nrefused. It was raining very hard at the time. We drew our skiff up on\r\nthe shore, turned it over for a shelter, and crawled beneath it with\r\nthe mail. As it was a cold, wet night, we suffered severely. As we\r\nwere passing an island above Red Wing, the day following, we saw some\r\nSioux Indian wigwams, and, as we had no firewater and no food to spare\r\nwe kept close to the opposite shore. We were, however, observed. An\r\nIndian appeared on the shore near the wigwams and beckoned to us to\r\ncross over. We made no reply but kept steadily on our course,\r\nobserving, meanwhile, that the Indian, with his gun, was skulking\r\nalong through the brush, apparently bent on overtaking and waylaying\r\nus. We kept a respectful distance, and fortunately were able to\r\nincrease it, but not till we were beyond rifle shot did we dare to\r\npause for rest. That night we camped without striking a light, and\r\nnext day arrived at Point Douglas. I went no further. The hardship and\r\nexposure of this trip brought on a severe illness. Mr. David Hone, at\r\nwhose house I remained for two weeks, under the care of Dr. Carli, of\r\nStillwater, took the mail to Fort Snelling. Soon as able I returned to\r\nStillwater.\r\n\r\nIn May of this year I had made a claim of government unsurveyed land,\r\ncovering springs sufficient for a water power. While I was sick at\r\nPoint Douglas, Joseph Brewster, Martin Mower and David B. Loomis\r\nformed a company to build a mill and carry on a logging business. They\r\nhad agreed upon me as a fourth partner and to build on my claim; Mower\r\nand Loomis to attend to getting logs, Brewster and Folsom to build the\r\nmill. We moved to our claim Oct. 6, 1846, and went to work in earnest.\r\nWe agreed upon the name of Arcola for the new settlement. The mill was\r\nnot finished until April 3, 1847, at which time Brewster and Folsom\r\nsold out their interest and returned to Stillwater.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTILLWATER IN 1846.\r\n\r\nLiving in Stillwater, Jan. 1, 1846, were the following married men:\r\nCornelius Lyman, Socrates Nelson, Walter R. Vail, Robert Kennedy,\r\nAnson Northrup, Albert Harris, John E. Mower, William E. Cove, John\r\nSmith, and W. H. C. Folsom. Among the unmarried men were: John\r\nMcKusick, C. Carli, Jacob Fisher, Elam Greely, Edward Blake, Elias\r\nMcKean, Calvin F. Leach, Martin Mower, David B. Loomis, Albion\r\nMasterman, John Morgan, Phineas Lawrence, Joseph Brewster, John\r\nCarlton, Thomas Ramsdell, William Rutherford, William Willim, Charles\r\nMacey, and Lemuel Bolles.\r\n\r\nHere follows a list of the pioneers of the St. Croix valley, in 1846,\r\nnot mentioned elsewhere: Nelson Goodenough, who became a river pilot\r\nand settled at Montrose, Iowa; James Patten, Hugh McFadden, Edwin\r\nPhillips, a millwright, an ingenious, eccentric man, who left the\r\nvalley in 1848; Joseph Brewster, who left in 1848, and settled in\r\nEarlville, Illinois; Sylvester Stateler, blacksmith, who removed to\r\nCrow Wing county, Minnesota, and O. H. Blair, who followed lumbering,\r\na man of talent, but eccentric. He died in 1878. The first school was\r\ntaught in 1846, by Mrs. Ariel Eldridge, formerly Sarah Louisa Judd.\r\nThe second school was taught in 1847, by Mrs. Greenleaf; the third in\r\n1848, by Wm. McKusick. A school house was built in 1848. Rev. W. T.\r\nBoutwell, a Presbyterian minister, preached occasionally in the\r\nreception room of Northrup's hotel. Rev. Eleazer Greenleaf, an\r\nEpiscopalian, came the next summer and established regular services.\r\nPrior to the organization of Stillwater, Rev. J. Hurlbut, a Methodist\r\nminister, had preached in Dakotah, St. Croix Falls and Marine, but\r\norganized no societies.\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1845-46 was very open. All teaming business was done on\r\nwheels, except for a few days in December, in which there was snow\r\nenough for sledding. A new feature in the trade of the valley this\r\nyear was the rafting and running of logs to St. Louis.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1845, Dr. Borup, of La Pointe, and others went by ice and\r\noverland with teams to Prairie du Chien, I accompanying them. The\r\nfirst day we came to Point Douglas, at the confluence of the St. Croix\r\nand the Mississippi. Between Stillwater and Point Douglas, on the\r\nroute we followed, some distance west of the lake, we found but one\r\nsettler, Joseph Haskell. At Point Douglas there were David Hone, a\r\nhotel keeper; Hertzell & Burris, merchants, and Wm. B. Dibble, farmer.\r\nWe reached Red Wing the second day. At this place lived the famous\r\nJack Frazier, a Sioux half-breed and Indian trader, one Presbyterian\r\nmissionary, Rev. ---- Denton, and a man named Bush. James Wells, more\r\nfamiliarly known as \"Bully Wells,\" lived with an Indian squaw on the\r\nwest shore of Lake Pepin, where stands the town of Frontenac. On the\r\nthird day we went as far as Wabasha, on the west side, three miles\r\nbelow Lake Pepin, where we found several French families. We stopped\r\nat Cratt's hotel. On the fourth day we reached Holmes' Landing, now\r\nFountain City. There were then but two houses, both unoccupied. About\r\nnoon we passed Wabasha prairie, now the site of Winona. It was then\r\ncovered with Indian tepees. At Trempealeau, in the evening of the\r\nfifth day, we found two French families. On the next day we reached La\r\nCrosse and found there two American families. Two days more brought us\r\nto Prairie du Chien. On the way we passed a few French families, and\r\nthese, with those previously named, constituted the entire white\r\npopulation between Stillwater and Prairie du Chien.\r\n\r\nWe started on our return with four two horse teams. We took the river\r\nroad, passing over the ice. In our company was one Tibbetts, from Fort\r\nCrawford, and Jonathan E. McKusick, emigrating from Maine to St. Croix\r\nvalley. They were a social, jovial pair. At Capilaux bluff, Dibble's\r\nteam was ahead, and my team second. At this place all halted to allow\r\nthe thirsty an opportunity of liquoring up, which was done at the rear\r\nteam. Dibble, in going back, left his team unfastened, and while he\r\nwas \"smiling\" with his jovial companions the team ran away. The horses\r\nsoon broke loose from the sled. One horse made for the shore, the\r\nother plunged into an air hole in the ice. The entire company rushed\r\nto the rescue, and with ropes and poles managed, at last, to float the\r\nhorse upon the ice in an unconscious condition. All the whisky left by\r\nthe \"smiling\" throng was poured down the horse's throat, but in vain.\r\nThe animal was dead. No other event of interest occurred except some\r\ndifficulties experienced in the transportation of the first cat ever\r\nbrought to Stillwater. \"Tom\" was caged in a narrow box, and the\r\nconfinement so chafed his proud spirit that he sickened and at one\r\ntime was reported dead. At the inquest held over his remains by Capt.\r\nMcKusick, signs of life were discovered, and by liberal blood-letting\r\nthe cat was restored to consciousness and lived several years\r\nafterward, a terror to the rats in Stillwater.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTILLWATER IN 1847.\r\n\r\nFor about a year the writer had been officiating as justice of the\r\npeace with but little official business, but now and then a marriage\r\nto celebrate. On one occasion I walked to Marine to marry W. C. Penny\r\nto Jane McCauslin. The marriage was celebrated at Burkelo's boarding\r\nhouse. The wedding supper consisted of cold water and cold pork and\r\nbeans. The following morning I did not wait for breakfast but returned\r\nto Stillwater as I had come, on foot. Another day I rode to Bissell's\r\nMounds and united in marriage John Kenny and a mulatto woman. Friend\r\nKennedy threatened to disown me for thus aiding miscegenation. \"Such\r\nthings are intolerable,\" he said, but from aught I have ever known to\r\nthe contrary the couple were well assorted.\r\n\r\n\r\nTERRITORIAL ELECTION.\r\n\r\nOn the sixth day of April an election was held for the ratification or\r\nrejection of the constitution adopted by the late territorial\r\nconvention for the anticipated state government; also a resolution\r\nrelative to negro suffrage, and an election was ordered for sheriff.\r\nThe vote resulted as follows:\r\n\r\nFor the constitution, 65; against, 61. For equal suffrage to colored\r\npersons, 1; against, 126. For sheriff, Walter R. Vail, 58; W. H. C.\r\nFolsom, 72.\r\n\r\nThere were five precincts that held elections--Stillwater, St. Paul,\r\nGray Cloud, Marine, and St. Croix Falls.\r\n\r\nI immediately gave bonds and qualified as sheriff, and the same day\r\ntook charge of two criminals, Chippewa Indians, who had been committed\r\nby me for murder, while acting as justice. I had previously deputized\r\nHam Gates to take care of them. While in Stillwater they were confined\r\nin the basement of the post office building. Their names were Nodin\r\nand Ne-she-ke-o-ge-ma. The latter was the son-in-law of Nodin. They\r\nwere very obedient and tractable, and I treated them kindly, for which\r\nNodin repeatedly told me he would show me a copper mine on Kanabec\r\nriver. Nodin died not long after his trial, and before he could redeem\r\nhis promise. The copper mine is yet undiscovered. Fort Snelling was,\r\nat that time, the receptacle for criminals in this region, and to the\r\nFort I carried these prisoners with a team,--Ham Gates being\r\ndriver,--unshackled, unbound, my only weapon a pistol without a lock.\r\nIn May I summoned jurors and visited Kanabec river to procure\r\nwitnesses in the case against Nodin and Ne-she-ke-o-ge-ma for the\r\nmurder of Henry Rust. The first night I stopped with B. F. Otis, on\r\nthe St. Croix, where Taylors Falls is now situated. On the second day\r\nI crossed the river and proceeded up the east side to Wolf creek,\r\nthence crossing to the west side, up as far as Sunrise river. There\r\nwas no inhabitant, Samuels having vacated his shanty. I crossed the\r\nriver with great difficulty. The water was high, the current was\r\nstrong and swift, and I could not swim. I found a fallen tree, partly\r\nunder water, cut a pole, waded out as far as I could into the current,\r\nand then by the aid of the pole floated down some distance, until by\r\npawing and splashing I was able to reach the other shore. That night I\r\nstopped with an old Indian trader, Mr. Connor, who, with his Indian\r\nwife, welcomed me to his bark shanty, divided into rooms by handsome\r\nmats, and made me quite comfortable. He had plenty of good food, and\r\nentertained me besides by a fund of anecdotes, incidents in Indian\r\nhistory, and adventures of traders, trappers and missionaries in the\r\nLake Superior and St. Croix region. He was a very intelligent and\r\ngenial man. Next day I went to Russell's farm, paddled a canoe to\r\nGround House river, and traveled thence on foot to Ann river, where I\r\nfound the parties of whom I was in quest, Greely, Colby, Otis and\r\nothers, a jolly log driving crew, with whom I spent a very pleasant\r\nevening. On the return journey, about two miles above the mouth of\r\nGround House river, I saw the ruins of the trading house in which\r\nHenry Rust was killed. Rust, at the time of his murder, was selling\r\nwhisky for Jack Drake. Rev. W. T. Boutwell gives the following account\r\nof the murder: \"In the winter of '46 and '47 I visited the camps of\r\nKent & True and Greely & Blake. On one occasion I met Rust, and asked\r\nhim to come and hear me preach. He did not attend. On this day I\r\npreached at three camps. On the following night, at Greely's camp,\r\ncame a midnight visitor with word that Rust had been shot.\r\nSeventy-five men armed themselves with all kinds of weapons, proceeded\r\nto the scene of the tragedy, removed the body of Rust and all\r\nvaluables from the house, knocked out the heads of two whisky barrels\r\nand fired the house, the whisky greatly aiding the combustion. I\r\nremoved the body to Pokegama and buried it there. Forty men attended\r\nthe funeral. They held a meeting and resolved to clear the country of\r\nwhisky. They commenced by destroying two barrels of it for Jarvis. He\r\nbegged hard for his whisky, saying he was a poor man, and in debt to\r\nFrank Steele at Fort Snelling. The response was, 'Out with your\r\nwhisky,' and it was destroyed before his eyes. The whisky of two other\r\ntrading stations followed. For a brief period there was peace, but the\r\nwhisky soon put in an appearance again.\"\r\n\r\nThe first term of district court held in Minnesota, then Wisconsin,\r\nwas convened in Stillwater, the county seat of St. Croix county, June\r\n1st. It was held in the upper story of John McKusick's store,\r\nsouthwest corner of Maine and Myrtle streets, Hon. Charles Dunn\r\npresiding. The session lasted one week. The bounds of St. Croix county\r\nthen included Crawford county, Wisconsin, on the south, Brown county,\r\nWisconsin, and the Lake Superior country on the east, the region as\r\nfar as the British possessions on the north, and to the Mississippi\r\nriver on the west. The jurors were found within a circuit of a hundred\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nThe grand jury was composed of the following gentlemen:\r\n\r\nJonathan McKusick, J. W. Furber, J. L. Taylor, W. R. Brown, Chas.\r\nCavalier, J. A. Ford, Hazen Mooers, C. Lyman, C. A. Tuttle, Hilton\r\nDoe, Elam Greely, Martin Mower, Jr., Edward Blake, W. B. Dibble,\r\nHarmon Crandall, Jerry Ross, James Saunders, Joseph Brown, J. R.\r\nIrving, J. W. Simpson, John Holton, Pascal Aldrich, and Albert Harris.\r\n\r\nJoseph R. Brown acted as clerk of court, Jonathan E. McKusick as\r\nforeman of the grand jury, and Morton S. Wilkinson as prosecuting\r\nattorney.\r\n\r\nThe attorneys present were: M. S. Wilkinson, of Stillwater; A.\r\nBrunson, of Prairie du Chien; Ben C Eastman, of Platteville, Crawford\r\nand Frank Dunn, of Mineral Point. There were but few civil cases.\r\nNodin and Ne-she-ke-o-ge-ma were indicted for murder, tried and\r\nacquitted on the ground that the killing was the result of a drunken\r\nbrawl.\r\n\r\nThis season, in addition to attending to my duties as sheriff, I went\r\nto St. Louis with a raft of logs. The steamer War Eagle, Capt. Smith\r\nHarris, towed through the two lakes, St. Croix and Pepin, a fleet\r\ncontaining ten acres of logs. During the winter of 1847-8, I was\r\nengaged in logging. It was difficult to get supplies to the pineries\r\nbefore the swamps were frozen over. This season my goods were taken by\r\nbatteaus from Stillwater to Clam lake.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMUSEMENTS.--SOCIETY BALL IN STILLWATER.\r\n\r\nA writer in the Stillwater _Lumberman_, April 23, 1877, gives a\r\nsketchy account of an old time ball, from which we select a few items:\r\n\r\nAnson Northrup kept what we called a first class hotel. If a man had\r\nblankets he could spread them upon the floor and sleep till the bell\r\nrang. If he had none he spread himself on the floor and paid for his\r\nlodging by tending stove and keeping the dogs from fighting. It was\r\none of the aristocratic rules of the house that a man who slept in\r\nblankets was not to be disturbed by dogs.\r\n\r\nAt one time our popular landlord got up a ball. He sent round a copper\r\ncolored card,--a half-breed Indian boy,--to tell all the folks to\r\ncome. Everybody was invited. At the appointed hour they began to\r\nassemble. Soon all in town arrived except one Smith. Frequent\r\ninquiries were made for Smith, and at last a deputation was sent to\r\ninquire the cause of his absence; when it transpired that he had\r\nbroken his leg. He said he was helping the landlord roll a barrel of\r\nwhisky from the landing when the barrel slipped, and, rolling back on\r\nhis leg, broke it. Northrup said that he had bet him one gallon of\r\nwhisky that he could not lift the barrel to his lips and drink from\r\nthe bung. In attempting to do this the barrel had slipped from his\r\ngrasp with the result before mentioned. The wife regretted the\r\naccident very much, and said that if it had not been for that barrel\r\nof whisky, or some other whisky, they might have both attended the\r\ndance. She could have put out the fire, locked up the house, tied up\r\nthe dog and taken her nine days' old baby with her. \"There would be\r\nyounger babies at the dance,\" she said.\r\n\r\nEverything was ready. The ball opened with three \"French fours,\" or\r\ntwo over. They danced a French two, the music consisting of one old\r\nviolin with three strings, played by a half-breed from St. Croix\r\nFalls. He played but one tune and called it, \"Off she goes to\r\nMiramachee.\" This carried a \"French four\" well enough, but when we\r\ndanced a cotillion or hornpipe there was a great deal of rolling\r\naround instead of dancing. We often called for a new tune. \"Oh, yes,\r\ngentlemen, you shall have him,\" but when we got him it was the same\r\nold \"Off she goes.\" He worked hard to please the company and the sweat\r\nrolled down his manly cheeks like the droppings from the eaves of a\r\nsaw mill; but all this would not do; it was the same old \"Off she\r\ngoes.\" There were twenty-four couples at the ball. The ladies brought\r\nwith them their babies, fourteen in number, and ranging from six weeks\r\nto six months old. The night passed merrily, uproariously, but without\r\ntragic incident. The fiddler became at last so tipsy that he could no\r\nlonger play \"Off she goes to Miramachee,\" and staggered off to that\r\nlocality himself. The only thing direful occurred at the breaking up,\r\nabout five o'clock in the morning. The fourteen babies had been laid\r\nto sleep on a bed, but some malevolent genius during the dance mixed\r\nthem up and changed their wraps, so that the mothers, in the hurry of\r\ntheir departure, gathered and took home with them each one some other\r\nmother's darling, and this deponent saith not that the snarl has ever\r\nbeen untangled and the babies restored to their rightful mothers.\r\n\r\nWith the year 1848 a new era dawned upon Stillwater and the valley of\r\nthe St. Croix. Great changes had taken place in the little town. There\r\nwere many new citizens, new buildings had been erected and the streets\r\nwere much improved. Slabs had been placed over the quagmires on Main\r\nstreet. A stage route had been established to St. Paul, on which\r\nstages ran regularly. This was the first stage route in Minnesota.\r\n\r\nThe correction lines of the government survey had been run in 1846-7,\r\nchiefly in the latter year. Township, range and section lines were run\r\nin 1847, and in the early part of 1848. Prior to this claims had been\r\nmade and were held subject to the limitations of the first legal\r\nsurvey. The creation of the new state of Wisconsin and the\r\nprospective organization of Minnesota Territory, the development of\r\nthe lumbering business and the formal opening of the government lands\r\nto entry, gave an impetus to immigration. Stillwater profited largely\r\nby this immigration, it being an objective point. Population\r\nincreased. The village was regularly surveyed and platted in the fall\r\nof 1848, Harvey Wilson, surveyor. Stillwater, although it never\r\naspired to be the future capital of the Territory, became a\r\nheadquarters for political characters and a place for public meetings\r\nfor the discussions of territorial and other public questions. It was\r\nconvenient of access, and contained up to that time a greater\r\npopulation than was to be found in St. Paul, and it seemed likely to\r\nbecome the commercial metropolis of the Territory.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] For the facts in this history I am indebted to John McKusick,\r\nJacob Fisher, Elias McKean, and Elam Greely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIOGRAPHIES.\r\n\r\nJOSEPH RENSHAW BROWN, one of the best known of the pioneers, came to\r\nDakotah, Schulenberg's addition, in 1839. For items in his history I\r\nam personally indebted to him. He was born in 1805, and, when old\r\nenough, apprenticed to a printer. On account of ill treatment he ran\r\naway and enlisted in the United States army at the age of fourteen\r\nyears, serving as a drummer boy. He came with the army to the\r\nNorthwest Territory in 1819. After enlistment he made his first home\r\nat Gray Cloud on the Mississippi, where he married a half-breed woman.\r\nWisconsin history says she was the daughter of Robert Dickson, Indian\r\ntrader and friend of the English in 1812. He learned and spoke the\r\nChippewa and Sioux languages fluently. In 1839 he founded the town of\r\nDakotah, at the head of Lake St. Croix, and erected some log\r\nbuildings. Through his influence, in part, St. Croix county was\r\norganized, and the county seat located in Dakotah.\r\n\r\nHe built here a two story log court house, which, the county failing\r\nto pay for, was left upon his hands. He kept a trading station, was\r\nclerk of the county court and county commissioner. He filled several\r\noffices of trust and was by far the most important and universally\r\nserviceable man in the new county of St. Croix. In 1843 he left\r\nDakotah, and returning to Gray Cloud, continued his Indian trade at\r\nthat point and further west by means of branch houses. He was a member\r\nof the territorial Wisconsin legislature two sessions at Madison. He\r\nreturned to Stillwater in 1848, left again in 1849, and in 1850\r\nremoved to St. Paul, where, in 1852, he purchased of Mr. Goodhue the\r\n_Pioneer_, then the leading Democratic paper of the Territory. Mr.\r\nBrown was chief clerk in the Minnesota territorial legislature during\r\nthe sessions of 1849, 1850 and 1851. In 1854 and 1855 he was a member\r\nof the territorial council. In 1857 he was a member of the Democratic\r\nwing of the constitutional convention. During his residence in St.\r\nPaul he was interested in building up the town of Henderson, to which\r\nplace he ran a stage line from St. Paul. About this time, also, he\r\nbusied himself with the invention of a steam wagon, calculated to\r\ntraverse the western plains and drag after it trains of cars.\r\nFinancial and other difficulties prevented the completion of his\r\ndesign, which, however, he never entirely abandoned during the\r\nremainder of his life. In fact he went East in 1870 expressly to get\r\nhis invention perfected, but from this journey he never returned. He\r\ndied somewhat suddenly in New York in that year.\r\n\r\nMr. Brown was a man of iron will and muscular frame. He owed but\r\nlittle to schools, but was a close observer of men and of the times in\r\nwhich he lived. He was a genial companion and true friend, and a man\r\nof honorable principles. His was a rugged but generous nature. He was\r\npublic spirited, far seeing and far reaching in his plans. He believed\r\nin the great Northwest. He predicted its future greatness as a wheat\r\ngrowing and agricultural country, and, as far back as 1839, predicted\r\nthat a great city would rise at the head of Lake St. Croix or at the\r\nFalls of St. Anthony. Yet so little schooled was he in the wisdom of\r\nthe speculator that he sold the property in St. Paul now known as\r\nKittson's addition, and worth several millions of dollars, for one\r\nhundred and fifty dollars, and a lot on Third street, now valued at\r\n$25,000, for a box of cigars.\r\n\r\nPAUL CARLI.--Mr. Carli was of German and Italian descent. He was born\r\nin Italy, July 25, 1805. His father was a merchant. He was married in\r\nChicago, in 1834, to a sister of Joseph R. Brown, and moved in 1841 to\r\nthe outlet of Bolles creek, on the west side of Lake St. Croix, to a\r\nplace near the site of Afton. In 1846 he was accidentally drowned in\r\nthe lake, within sight of his dwelling. His children, Joseph R. and\r\nMaria, are residents of Stillwater.\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER CARLI, brother of Paul, was born at Frankfort-on-the-Main,\r\nGermany, Dec. 7, 1811. The youth of Christopher was devoted to study.\r\nHe was educated at Heidelberg University, and studied medicine. He\r\ncame to America in February, 1832. The March following he located in\r\nBuffalo, where he practiced medicine three years, and returned to\r\nEurope where he remained two years. Returning to America, he practiced\r\na year in Chicago, a year in New Orleans and another year in Chicago.\r\nHe came to Dakotah, St. Croix valley, May 24, 1841. March 12, 1847, he\r\nwas married to the widow of Paul Carli, Joseph R. Brown officiating as\r\nmagistrate. He was the first practicing physician north of Prairie du\r\nChien. His home was at Dakotah until the organization of Stillwater.\r\nHe opened his first office on the west side of Lower Main street,\r\nblock 28. His practice extended from Lake Pepin to Lake Superior and\r\nfrom Menomonie Mills, Wisconsin, to the Mississippi river. His mode of\r\ntravel was by birch canoe, on horseback, on skates and on foot. He was\r\na member of the first city council in Stillwater and has been city and\r\ncounty physician. He opened the first bank in Stillwater when\r\nfractional currency was in demand. His floating scrip was all\r\nredeemed. Two children, Christopher and Socrates N., are married and\r\nresidents of Stillwater. Dr. Carli died Nov. 6, 1887.\r\n\r\nLYDIA ANN CARLI.--Mrs. Carli has passed through many stirring scenes,\r\nand is one of the first female settlers in the St. Croix valley. A\r\nfluent and interesting talker, her recitals of early incidents and\r\nadventures are heart enlivening. Lydia Ann Brown was born in\r\nLancaster, Penn., March 18, 1818. In 1834 she came with friends to\r\nChicago, where in 1839 she was married to Paul Carli. She came to\r\nDakotah in 1841, and lived there until 1844. The village was\r\nsurrounded by Indians and there was no white woman nearer than Marine,\r\ntwelve miles distant. In 1844 the Carlis removed to the mouth of\r\nBolles creek, near Afton, on Lake St. Croix, where they built\r\nthemselves a two story house commanding a picturesque view of the lake\r\nand the adjacent prairies and hills. It was a lone tenement, midway\r\nbetween Prescott and Stillwater. Mrs. Carli having lost her husband as\r\nbefore narrated, in 1847 was married to his brother, Dr. Christopher\r\nCarli.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: James S. Anderson]\r\n\r\nPHINEAS LAWRENCE.--But little is known of the early life of Mr.\r\nLawrence. He had been a river pilot. He was the first sheriff elected\r\nin the St. Croix valley, or northwest of Prairie du Chien. He was\r\nelected and qualified in 1841. On serving the first and only summons\r\nhe was ever called upon to serve, he approached the party summoned,\r\nholding up to view the documents, and exclaimed: \"I, Phineas Lawrence,\r\nhigh sheriff of St. Croix county, in the name of the United States and\r\nof the Immaculate God, command you to surrender.\" He was a robust,\r\nfleshy, cheerful man, and felt in all their force the responsibilities\r\nof the position in which he was placed. His name has been given to a\r\ncreek in Chisago county, where he once logged. He died in Stillwater\r\nin 1847.\r\n\r\nJACOB FISHER.--Jacob Fisher, a millwright, came to St. Croix Falls in\r\n1842, and being a skilled mechanic found employment at once on the old\r\nmill at the Falls. He made the first land claim and framed the first\r\nbuilding in Stillwater. The building framed was the mill of which\r\nmention has been made. This establishes his claim to priority as the\r\nfirst white man who made a movement toward the settlement of\r\nStillwater. Others were before him in the settlement of Dakotah or\r\nSchulenberg's addition. Mr. Fisher is a plain, frank, outspoken man,\r\nwho has no trouble in making his hearers understand exactly what he\r\nmeans. He was born in Canada in 1813, and still resides in Stillwater.\r\nHe has a wife and one son in California.\r\n\r\nJAMES S. ANDERSON was born at Marshalltown, West Virginia, on the\r\nfourth of February, 1826. When he was twelve years old his parents\r\nremoved with him to Burlington, Iowa, where he lived for eight years.\r\nHe came to Stillwater in 1846, where he has since resided. In 1852 he\r\nwas married to Miss Harriet T. McDonald, at St. Louis, by whom he has\r\nhad four children, three of whom are now living--Robert M. Anderson,\r\nprominently known in lumber circles, and Misses Sibella S. and Ella P.\r\nAnderson. Upon Mr. Anderson's arrival at Stillwater, he engaged in the\r\nemploy of Elias McKean, then a prominent lumberman, now a resident of\r\nWashington county. In 1869 Mr. Anderson formed a partnership with\r\nWilliam McKusick, John A. Nelson and Alexander Johnson, under the firm\r\nname of McKusick, Anderson & Co., which firm built and operated the\r\nlarge saw mill opposite Stillwater. Four years ago Mr. McKusick\r\nretired from the firm, since which time the firm has been J. S.\r\nAnderson & Co. In 1874 Mr. Anderson became the senior member of a\r\nheavy logging firm known as Anderson & O'Brien, of which the other\r\nmembers were the well known lumbermen J. S. and John O'Brien. In\r\nconnection with his other business interests Mr. Anderson was a heavy\r\nowner of pine lands, and a stockholder and director in the Lumberman's\r\nNational Bank. There were two other well known lumber firms of ancient\r\ndate with which he was connected, and these were McComb, Simpson &\r\nCo., organized in 1850, and also Delano, McKusick & Co., organized in\r\n1857. From 1857 to 1869 he was also a heavy logger alone. Mr. Anderson\r\ndied May 8, 1885. His death resulted from a mill accident, his rubber\r\ncoat having caught in the belting of a shaft revolving at a rapid\r\nrate. His body was frightfully mangled, but he survived two days,\r\nexhibiting, under the circumstances, the most remarkable composure,\r\ndictating his will and arranging his business matters as calmly as he\r\nmight have done on an ordinary occasion.\r\n\r\nEMANUEL DIXON FARMER was born in Tennessee in 1828, and came to\r\nStillwater in 1845, where he has resided ever since, engaged in the\r\nlumbering and saloon business. He was married to Parmelia A. Collier,\r\nin Stillwater, 1848.\r\n\r\nCOL. JOHN GREELY.--Col. Greely was sixty years of age when he came to\r\nthe West, and although a strong, active and enterprising man in the\r\nearlier part of his life, owing to advancing years and ill health was\r\nrather a spectator than an active participant in the stirring scenes\r\nof his new home. He was born at Southampton, Massachusetts, April,\r\n1777. He was married to Hannah Greely, a second cousin, at Hopkinton,\r\nNew Hampshire, Oct. 5, 1801. He followed the lumbering business on the\r\nMerrimac river in early life. He furnished the timber used in erecting\r\nthe first factory in Lowell, Massachusetts, cut on the mountains of\r\nNorth New Hampshire. In after life he moved to the west end of Sebec\r\nlake, Maine, where he founded the town at first named Greely, but\r\nafterward Willimantic, now the site of extensive manufactories where\r\nthe famous Willimantic thread is made. Col. Greely came to Stillwater\r\nin 1847.\r\n\r\nBorn during the Revolutionary struggle, he lived to witness the\r\nmarvelous growth and prosperity of his country and died during the\r\nfirst year of the war of the Rebellion. Aged as he was, having entered\r\nupon his eighty-fifth year, he was intensely interested in the issue\r\nof that struggle, and ardently desired to live long enough to witness\r\nthe triumph of his country's cause. It was not to be. He sank\r\npeacefully to rest, Oct. 30, 1861, dying as he had lived, an honest\r\nman, his memory revered by all who knew him, and cherished by three\r\ngenerations of descendants. His children were three sons and five\r\ndaughters--Sarah, Mrs. Blake, Mrs. Greenleaf, and Phebe and Servia,\r\nwives of John McKusick. Miss Sarah alone survives.\r\n\r\nMRS. HANNAH GREELY.--Mrs. Greely, the wife of Col. John Greely, was\r\nborn in Hopkinton, New Hampshire, October, 1787, came to Stillwater in\r\n1847 and died May, 1878, at the advanced age of ninety years. For\r\nsixty years she and her husband walked side by side. She survived him\r\nseventeen years, and, after a life well spent, resignedly folded her\r\nhands and sank to her last repose.\r\n\r\nELAM GREELY.--Elam, son of Col. John Greely, was born in Salisbury,\r\nNew Hampshire, Aug. 13, 1818, and, with his parents, moved to Maine,\r\nwhere they made their home on Sebec lake. In 1840 Mr. Greely came to\r\nSt. Croix Falls, where he was employed by the St. Croix Falls Company\r\nthe greater part of the time until 1843, when he became a settler at\r\nthe head of Lake St. Croix. He was one of the original owners of the\r\nfirst mill at Stillwater. In 1844 he sold his interest to John\r\nMcKusick. The same year he was appointed postmaster at Stillwater. The\r\noffice was located at the southwest corner of Main and Chestnut\r\nstreets.\r\n\r\nMr. Greely filled many offices of honor and trust meritoriously. He\r\nwas a member of the third and fourth Minnesota territorial councils.\r\nIn 1845, in company with Edward Blake, he did an extensive pine log\r\nbusiness, running the logs to St. Louis, in which business he\r\ncontinued until the death of Mr. Blake in 1848.\r\n\r\nMr. Greely early identified himself with the interests of Stillwater,\r\nof which he was one of the founders, and which owes much of its\r\nprosperity to his efforts. He was married in Kenosha, Wisconsin, in\r\n1850, to Hannah P. Hinman, who, with three children, a son and two\r\ndaughters, survives him. His oldest son died Oct. 21, 1876. Mr. Greely\r\nhad many severe reverses in business, but by indomitable energy\r\nrecovered from them, and was able not only to care for his aged\r\nparents, to bring them from Maine and keep them with him until\r\nseparated by death, but to leave his family well provided for. He died\r\nsuddenly away from home, Sept. 14, 1883. His body was brought to\r\nStillwater for burial.\r\n\r\nHIMAN GREELY.--Himan, son of Col. John Greely, was born in Franklin,\r\nNew Hampshire, October, 1828. He came to Stillwater in 1846, where he\r\nfollowed the business of lumbering. In 1850 he was married to Lucia\r\nDarling. After a brief residence in Stillwater, he removed to\r\nBeauford, Blue Earth county, where he remained until his death in\r\n1882. His wife survived him but a few months. The bodies of both were\r\nremoved and buried in Fairview cemetery, Stillwater. Mr. Greely\r\napplied himself closely to business, and was an honest, upright and\r\nintelligent man. His education was derived chiefly from reading and\r\nobservation. He left two sons.\r\n\r\nAQUILLA GREELY.--Aquilla, the youngest son of Col. Greely, was born in\r\nGreely, Maine, June, 1831. During his youth he spent several years\r\nwith friends in Canada, where he learned the art of surveying. He came\r\nto Minnesota in 1849, and followed surveying and lumbering. He died in\r\nStillwater, April 25, 1857.\r\n\r\nELIAS MCKEAN.--A thorough business man, an eccentric man, notably so,\r\nan apt man, ready in reply, somewhat harsh, if irritated, but kind in\r\nheart and forgiving in spirit, is Elias McKean. He was born in\r\nBradford county, Pennsylvania, June 30, 1817, and received a practical\r\neducation. His father was a man of some note, and for twenty-eight\r\nyears a circuit judge in Pennsylvania. Elias McKean came to St. Croix\r\nFalls in 1841, and for a year was in the employ of the Falls Company,\r\nbut afterward engaged successfully in business for himself. He was one\r\nof the original proprietors of the Stillwater mill, and one of the\r\nfounders of Stillwater. In 1850 he settled on a farm on the west side\r\nof Lake St. Croix. In 1855 he was married to the widow of Calvin F.\r\nLeach, and a family of six sons has grown up around them.\r\n\r\nCALVIN F. LEACH.--We are not able to give date or place of birth. Mr.\r\nLeach came to St. Croix Falls in 1842 and soon after came to the head\r\nof Lake St. Croix, and became one of the original owners of the mill,\r\nand a founder of the city of Stillwater. In 1850 he was married to\r\nMiss ---- Smith, of St. Anthony. He died in St. Louis in 1853. He was\r\nmodest and retiring in his demeanor, correct in his deportment and\r\nrespected by all his acquaintances.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES NELSON.--Mr. Nelson was born in Conway, Massachusetts, Jan.\r\n11, 1814, received an academic education, was married to Mrs. Bertha\r\nD. Bartlett in 1844, at Hennepin, Ill., and the same year came to\r\nStillwater, and engaged in selling goods. Previous to his removal to\r\nStillwater he engaged in merchandising in Illinois, in 1839, and in\r\nSt. Louis from 1840 to 1844, where he established a trading post on\r\nthe Mississippi nearly opposite Reed's Landing, at a place since known\r\nas Nelson's Landing. Mr. Nelson was the first merchant in Stillwater.\r\nHis store stood on Main street. He built a substantial dwelling and\r\nlived in it until his death, May 6, 1867. He filled many public\r\npositions, was territorial auditor from 1853 to 1857, and was a\r\nsenator in the second state legislature. As a merchant he was very\r\nsuccessful, being fitted by nature for commercial pursuits. In 1853,\r\nhe, with others, built a saw mill in South Stillwater and engaged in\r\nlumbering. He was of a free and generous disposition in all his\r\nrelations of life. He conveyed, as a donation to Washington county, a\r\nhalf interest in the block of land on which the court house stands.\r\nHis liberality and public spirit did much for the prosperity of\r\nStillwater. His wife and one daughter, Mrs. Fayette Marsh, survived\r\nhim, but Mrs. Marsh died in 1880. She was a woman of great sweetness\r\nof disposition, and beloved by all who knew her. His widow died in\r\n1885.\r\n\r\nMRS. SOCRATES NELSON.--Bertha D. was born at Conway, Franklin county,\r\nMassachusetts, Sept. 6, 1813. She was married to Geo. A. Bartlett, of\r\nConway, in 1838, and removed with him to Knoxville, Illinois, where he\r\ndied. She returned to her parents in Massachusetts, and removed with\r\nthem to Hennepin, Illinois. In the fall of 1844 she was married to\r\nSocrates Nelson, and came with him to Stillwater. She died Oct. 8,\r\n1885. She was the last of her family, husband and daughter having\r\npreceded her to the world of spirits. The large attendance of old\r\nsettlers from Washington county and elsewhere at her funeral, and the\r\nbeautiful floral tributes contributed by her friends, attested but\r\npartially the respect and veneration in which she was held.\r\n\r\nEDWARD BLAKE.--Of Mr. Blake's early history we have no data. He came\r\nto the St. Croix valley in company with Elam Greely in 1840, engaged\r\nin lumbering, and died in 1849.\r\n\r\nWALTER R. VAIL.--Mr. Vail, the second merchant in Stillwater, came\r\nWest in 1844. He built a store, with dwelling attached, just south of\r\nSocrates Nelson's store, which buildings are still standing and\r\noccupied (1886). Mr. Vail was not successful in business and moved\r\naway in 1848.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARTIN MOWER. A PRACTICAL AND SUCCESSFUL LUMBERMAN OF\r\nSTILLWATER.]\r\n\r\nJOHN E. MOWER.--Mr. Mower was born in Bangor, Maine, Sept. 15, 1815.\r\nHe was married to Gratia Remick, in Keokuk, Iowa, in 1842, and removed\r\nto St. Croix Falls, where he entered the employ of the Falls Lumbering\r\nCompany. Two years later he removed to Stillwater, where he built the\r\nsecond frame dwelling, still standing. Mr. Mower was a millwright and\r\ncarpenter, but was engaged in lumbering most of his time. He purchased\r\nan interest in the mill property at Arcola, in 1847, which place he\r\nmade his home until his death, which occurred June 11, 1879. He left a\r\nwidow and three daughters, Helen, wife of the late Louis Torinus;\r\nEmily, wife of Henry Van Voorhees; and Mary, wife of ---- Richardson.\r\nOne son died after arriving at manhood. Mr. Mower was a pleasant,\r\nreliable man, a kind husband and loving father. He was honored by his\r\nfellow citizens with an election to the fifth and sixth territorial\r\ncouncils, and to the seventeenth state legislature (house). The\r\nterritorial legislature affixed his name to a county.\r\n\r\nMARTIN MOWER.--Martin, brother of John E. Mower, came to St. Croix\r\nFalls in 1842, and worked in the employ of the Falls Company.\r\nAfterward he engaged in lumbering and became one of the original\r\nproprietors of the Arcola mill. He was also engaged in manufacturing\r\nand merchandising in Stillwater. He built a fine block of buildings on\r\nChestnut street, recently burned down and rebuilt on a larger scale.\r\nHe has been one of the managing owners of the St. Croix Boom Company\r\nfrom its origin. His business interests have been divided between\r\nStillwater and Arcola, but he has made the latter place his home since\r\n1846. As a business man he is capable and shrewd, giving close\r\nattention to his business; in his manner somewhat eccentric. He has\r\ndone in much to improve the farming and other interests of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM WILLIM.--A firm, consistent, worthy citizen and true friend of\r\nhis adopted country is William Willim. He was born in the parish of\r\nWoolhope, Herefordshire, England, June 26, 1821; came to America in\r\n1838, and to Stillwater in 1844. He was married in 1847 to Clara G.\r\nHaskell, and, after her death in 1850, to Joanna W. Hinman. Mr. Willim\r\nis a stonemason, plasterer and contractor. He was a member of the\r\nsixth Minnesota territorial legislature, and has filled many\r\nresponsible positions in Stillwater. Mr. Willim's was the first\r\nnaturalization that occurred in the limits of Minnesota. The oath of\r\nallegiance, a somewhat unique and original document of its kind, bears\r\ndate of June 18, 1847, Stillwater, St. Croix county, Wisconsin\r\nTerritory, and is signed by Joseph R. Brown.\r\n\r\nALBERT HARRIS.--Mr. Harris was a native of Maine. He was born in 1815\r\nand married to Miss Greenleaf in 1841, who died in 1853.

He was married in Brookfield to Betsey Cushman\r\nand came to Illinois at an early date, whence he removed to Marine\r\nMills, in 1842, where he kept a boarding house until 1844, when he\r\nremoved to Stillwater, where he kept a boarding house until 1848. He\r\nthen removed to his farm three miles above Stillwater, where, by\r\nindustry and economy, aided by his faithful wife, he was able to build\r\na comfortable home, in which they continued to live until at a good\r\nold age they were removed by death, which claimed them in the same\r\nyear, the husband dying January, 1864, and the wife in April. They\r\nwere members of the Presbyterian church from early life, and respected\r\nas citizens, honored as Christians. Mrs. Lyman was one of the\r\nexcellent of the earth. Mr. Lyman had an inexhaustible fund of humor,\r\nand was rather fond of practical joking. Many of his jokes were of the\r\nrarest description. They left two sons, Cornelius Storrs and David\r\nPride.\r\n\r\nDAVID B. LOOMIS.--Few men have been more active in business and public\r\nlife than David B. Loomis. He was born in Wilmington, Connecticut,\r\nApril 17, 1817. In 1830 he came with his parents to Alton, Illinois,\r\nwhere, at the age of fifteen, he engaged as clerk in a store and\r\nserved in that capacity five years. Mr. Loomis was in the building in\r\nAlton in which Lovejoy was shot and killed for the expression of\r\nsentiments which the nation has since been compelled to adopt. In 1843\r\nhe came to the St. Croix valley and engaged in lumbering. In 1846 he\r\nwas one of the four original owners of the Arcola mill, but in 1849\r\nsold his interest to Mr. Mower, and for four succeeding years was in\r\ncharge of the St. Croix boom. In 1847 he was surveyor general of logs\r\nand lumber.

In 1853 he was one of a\r\ncompany that built a mill in South Stillwater. He sold out in 1859. In\r\n1861 he entered the army as lieutenant, Company F, Second Minnesota\r\nVolunteers, and was promoted to a captaincy. He served three and a\r\nhalf years. Stillwater has been his home since the war. In 1873 he\r\nrepresented Washington county in the legislature.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM E. COVE.--The year of Mr. Cove's birth is not known. He came\r\nto Stillwater in 1844. His marriage to Nancy Edwards, elsewhere noted,\r\nwas the second marriage in the village. He was by trade a house\r\ncarpenter. He removed to Minneapolis in 1864.\r\n\r\nJOHN SMITH.--Of the eight first families, that of John Smith was one.\r\nOf this particular \"John Smith\" little is known, except that he was\r\nsober and industrious, and, in 1848, moved to parts unknown.\r\n\r\nJOHN MORGAN.--We have no account of the early days of Mr. Morgan,\r\nexcept that he was a native of Pennsylvania. He was living in\r\nStillwater in 1845, in the employ of Churchill & Nelson. In 1848 he\r\nwas elected sheriff of St. Croix county, Wisconsin. In the same year\r\nhe was married to Hannah Harnish. He settled on a farm and kept a\r\n\"half way house\" on the road from Stillwater to St. Paul, when the\r\npioneer stages of Willoughby & Power were placed on this route. In\r\n1848 he obtained a charter from the Wisconsin legislature for a ferry\r\nacross Lake St. Croix at Stillwater. This ferry changed ownership\r\nrepeatedly and was discontinued when the bridge was built.\r\n\r\nANSON NORTHRUP.--This gentleman, whose name was borne by the first\r\nsteamboat ever launched on the Red River of the North, and who brought\r\nthe first drove of cattle through from Illinois to St. Croix Falls,\r\ndeserves a conspicuous place in the annals of the Northwest. He was\r\nborn in Conewango, Cataraugus county, New York, Jan. 4, 1817. His\r\neducation was limited, but he was a man of more than ordinary native\r\nability and energy. He lived in Ohio some years, and came West in\r\n1838. In 1839 he drove the first herd of cattle through a wilderness\r\ncountry from the Wisconsin river to the St. Croix. In 1841 he removed\r\nhis family from Ohio to St. Croix Falls. He came by way of St. Louis,\r\nfrom that point embarking on the steamer Indian Queen for the Falls.\r\nThe steamer was three weeks making the trip. Above Prairie du Chien\r\ncrew and passengers were obliged to cut wood to run the boat. Mr.\r\nNorthrup had married Betsey Edwards, daughter of widow Edwards, one of\r\nthe pioneers of Stillwater. Charles H., their eldest son, was the\r\nfirst white child born at St. Croix Falls. In the spring of 1844 he\r\nmoved to Stillwater, where he built and kept the first hotel in that\r\nplace. From 1847 to 1848 he was part owner of the Osceola saw mill\r\nalong with Mahony and Kent. In 1849 he removed to St. Paul, and built\r\nthe American Hotel on Third street, east from Seven Corners. In 1851\r\nhe removed to St. Anthony Falls and built there the St. Charles Hotel.\r\nIn 1853 he removed to Minneapolis, and built the Bushnell House, the\r\nfirst brick building in the city. Subsequently he became a resident at\r\nLong Prairie, Swan River and Duluth. Although Mr. Northrup's genius\r\ntended chiefly in the direction of hotel building, his abilites in\r\nother directions were beyond question. With equal facility he turned\r\nhis hand to lumbering, steamboating and statesmanship. His great\r\nsteamboat enterprise was the attempted transfer of the steamer North\r\nStar by water from the Mississippi to the Red River of the North. The\r\nboat was one hundred feet long by twenty wide, and of light draught.\r\nStarting from St. Cloud in the spring of 1859 he performed the\r\nwonderful feat of ascending the Mississippi as far as Pokegama Falls,\r\nhoping to ascend further, and during a high stage of water to float\r\nthe boat over the height of land into some of the tributaries of the\r\nRed river. The water was not sufficiently high. The winter following\r\nhe took the boat to pieces, and removed it by land to Red river,\r\nopposite the mouth of the Cheyenne, where it was reconstructed and\r\nlaunched, taken to Fort Garry and afterward sold to Mr. Burbank. This\r\nboat, its name being changed to Anson Northrup, was the first\r\nsteamboat on the waters of Red river.\r\n\r\nMr. Northrup's political career commenced and closed with the first\r\nMinnesota legislature, 1857-58, he representing the counties of\r\nMorrison, Crow Wing and Mille Lacs in the senate.\r\n\r\nDuring the Rebellion he served as wagon master. He lived in Texas\r\nthree years, returned to St. Paul, where he lived in 1874-75-76, and\r\nnow lives in Bismarck, Dakota.\r\n\r\nROBERT KENNEDY.--Mr. Kennedy, in 1839, located at Holmes' Landing, now\r\nFountain City, on the banks of the Mississippi, above Winona. In 1844\r\nhe removed to Dakotah, where he kept a hotel in the old tamarack court\r\nhouse, built by Joseph R. Brown. In 1846 he kept a hotel in the\r\nNorthrup House, Stillwater; in 1848 he kept the American Hotel,\r\nShakopee. Subsequently he returned to St. Paul and kept a boarding\r\nhouse, and for three years the hotel known as \"Moffett's Castle.\"\r\nAfterward he kept the Snelling House, and last the Bernard House.\r\nFrom 1853 to 1856 he was collector of customs for the port of St.\r\nPaul, and during that time the fees amounted to the enormous sum of\r\nforty six dollars and forty-two cents. Mr. Kennedy spent about thirty\r\nyears as a landlord, in which capacity he was very popular.\r\n\r\nHARVEY WILSON.--Mr. Wilson was born in Corinth, Saratoga county, New\r\nYork, December, 1815. He resided in his native county twenty-five\r\nyears, then removed to St. Louis, where, for three years, he engaged\r\nin surveying. He came to St. Croix Falls in 1843 and to Stillwater in\r\n1847. He acted as J. R. Brown's deputy clerk of court, June term,\r\n1847. He was appointed clerk of the first Minnesota territorial term\r\nof court, Aug. 13, 1849, in which office he continued until his death,\r\nNov. 3, 1876. Mr. Wilson was married in 1851 to widow Mary\r\nStanchfield.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON SHORT.--Mr. Short was born in St. Clair county,\r\nIllinois, in 1818. He came thence to the St. Croix valley and located\r\nat Marine in 1843, and commenced running rafts with W. B. Dibble. In\r\n1857 and 1858 he gathered logs as agent in Lake St. Croix, rafted and\r\nrun them below, but lost heavily and was in fact financially wrecked.\r\nHe afterward engaged in the logging and hardware business in\r\nStillwater. In 1868 he built the famous Dudley mills at Point Douglas,\r\nat a cost of $35,000. Mr. Short made Stillwater his home until 1862,\r\nwhen he removed to Hastings. Much credit is due him for what he has\r\naccomplished. When he came to the St. Croix valley he could neither\r\nread nor write, but by energy, industry and native force of character,\r\nnotwithstanding a few reverses, he has done far more than many other\r\nmen in his position could have done. As a man he is genial and social.\r\n\r\nJAMES D. MCCOMB.--Mr. McComb was born in Washington county,\r\nPennsylvania, Feb. 13, 1827, came to Stillwater June 10, 1846, and\r\nengaged in mercantile business with John H.

He was a member of the\r\nfirm of Short, Proctor & Co., hardware merchants. In 1860 he was\r\nappointed warden of the Minnesota state prison, which office he held\r\nuntil 1868. In 1860 he was also appointed secretary and treasurer of\r\nthe St. Croix Boom Company. He performed the duties of both positions,\r\nbut continued to serve the boom company twenty years. His experience\r\nand reliability made him almost the umpire of this company. He was\r\nappointed surveyor general for the years 1881 to 1884, inclusive. Mr.\r\nProctor was married to Caroline Lockwood, daughter of John Lockwood,\r\nof Prairie du Chien, in 1854. They have one son, Levi.\r\n\r\nBARRON PROCTOR, brother of John S. Proctor, came to Stillwater when a\r\nyoung man, but after a few years removed to New Orleans, whence he\r\nreturned to Stillwater, and in 1873 engaged in flour manufacturing as\r\none of the firm of Cahill, Townshend & Co. He disposed of his interest\r\nin 1880. Mr. Proctor was married to Hettie Carson, adopted daughter of\r\nSocrates Nelson and widow of John A. Hanford. He lives in St. Paul.\r\n\r\nHENRY WESTING is a native of Hanover. He emigrated to America in 1840\r\nand came to Stillwater in 1848. He commenced his business career as a\r\nday laborer and by industry, perseverance and tact, rose to a position\r\nof wealth and influence. He died in Stillwater, Feb. 26, 1885, much\r\nesteemed by his associates for his sterling qualities of character.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS DUNN was born in 1823, in Queens county, Ireland. He emigrated\r\nto America in 1826, locating at Miramachi, on the northeast coast of\r\nNew Brunswick. He came thence to Maine, where he spent two years. He\r\ncame to the St. Croix valley in 1846, located in Stillwater, where he\r\nhas since lived and been engaged in lumbering. He is the owner of a\r\nvaluable land property at Yellow Lake, Burnett county, Wisconsin. He\r\nhas been a member of the Catholic church since infancy.\r\n\r\nCHARLES J. GARDINER was born at Charlotte, Maine, in 1826, and came to\r\nStillwater in 1849, where he followed lumbering and farming. He served\r\nas surveyor of the First Minnesota district five years. He was married\r\nin 1853 to Pamela Jackman. They have five children.\r\n\r\nSAMUEL STAPLES was born in Topsham, Maine, September, 1805. He came\r\nwest from Brunswick, Maine, in 1854, and located in Stillwater, where\r\nhe died, Dec. 26, 1887. He is the elder brother of Isaac, Silas and\r\nWinslow Staples. He leaves a widow (his second wife), two daughters,\r\nMrs. E. A. Folsom and Mrs. G. M. Stickney, and two sons, Josiah and\r\nWinslow, besides a step-son, William Langly.\r\n\r\nJOSIAH STAPLES, son of Samuel, was born in Brunswick, Maine, June 20,\r\n1826. He received a good common school education. At the age of\r\nthirteen his family removed to Penobscot county, and later to the\r\nprovince of New Brunswick, but returned to Maine in 1840. In 1848 he\r\ncame to Stillwater, and has since been continuously engaged in milling\r\nand lumbering operations, and, latterly, in steamboating. He was\r\nmarried to Lydia McGlaughlin in 1853. His children are six sons and\r\none daughter.\r\n\r\nJOEL M. DARLING was born in Madison county, New York, in 1842. He came\r\nto Galena, Illinois, in 1840, and to Stillwater in 1848, where he\r\nengaged in farming. He served three years during the Civil War in\r\nCompany F, Seventh Minnesota, and has since been pensioned for\r\ndisabilities incurred in the service. He is unmarried. He lives in\r\nSouth Stillwater.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY RIVER PILOTS.\r\n\r\nJOE PERRO.--\"Big Joe\" as he was familiarly called, was large of frame\r\nand big-hearted as well, honest, manly, of good report for courage and\r\nhonesty. He was fearless and prompt in taking the part of the weak and\r\noppressed. We were once passing together up Broadway, St. Louis, when\r\nwe passed a peanut stand. A small negro boy was crying piteously and\r\nbegging the peanut vender to give him back his money, to which appeal\r\nthe peanut vender was obdurate. We halted. Joe Perro organized a\r\ncourt, heard the testimony of man and boy, and satisfied himself that\r\nin making change the man had wrongfully withheld a dime due the boy.\r\nJoe decided in favor of the boy and ordered the vender of peanuts to\r\npay him the ten cents. He replied insolently: \"It is none of your\r\nd----d business.\" That was enough to kindle the magazine of Joe's\r\nwrath. A sudden blow of his fist, and the man was prostrate on the\r\nsidewalk and his peanuts and apples scattered. The last seen of the\r\ndiscomfited street merchant he was on his hands and knees scrambling\r\nwith the boys for the possession of his scattered fruits, and casting\r\nan occasional vengeful glance at the towering form of \"Big Joe\"\r\ndeparting slowly from the scene of conflict. Mr. Perro is of French\r\nparentage, and a native of Kaskaskia, Illinois. He has been a resident\r\nof Stillwater since 1844.\r\n\r\nJAMES MCPHAIL.--Mr. McPhail, as his name indicates, is of Scotch\r\nparentage. He was born in Inverness, Scotland, in 1824, and came to\r\nAmerica in early life. He was one of the first log pilots on the\r\nwaters of the Mississippi and St. Croix. He settled in Stillwater in\r\n1848, was married to Eliza Purinton in 1849, and died in St. Louis in\r\n1857. Mrs. McPhail died in Stillwater in 1885. They left no children.\r\n\r\nJOHN CORMACK.--Mr. Cormack commenced piloting on the St. Croix in\r\n1845. He was married in 1860 to Miss Jackins. He made his home in\r\nStillwater continuously for thirty years, during which time he served\r\nas pilot. He died at Princeton, Mille Lacs county, in 1885.\r\n\r\nJOHN HANFORD.--Mr. Hanford was a St. Croix river pilot in the '40s. He\r\nmarried an adopted daughter of Socrates Nelson, of Stillwater. He died\r\nat Stillwater. Mrs. Hanford subsequently married Barron Proctor.\r\n\r\nJOHN LEACH.--Mr. Leach made his home at Marine many years, during\r\nwhich time he engaged in piloting on the St. Croix; subsequently he\r\nremoved to Stillwater. In the later years of his life he has been\r\nblind.\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN B. HANKS.--Mr. Stephen B. Hanks, formerly of Albany, Illinois,\r\npiloted the first raft from St. Croix Falls to St. Louis in 1842. He\r\nfollowed piloting rafts and steamboats until 1885.\r\n\r\nSAMUEL S. HANKS.--Samuel, a brother of Stephen B., commenced piloting\r\nin the '40s, and is still active.\r\n\r\n     Among the early pilots on the St. Croix and Mississippi\r\n     rivers were Antoine Lapoint, Augustus Barlow, Richard\r\n     Whiting, James Hickman, George M. Penny, and Daniel McLean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nPOLK COUNTY--DESCRIPTION AND HISTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nPolk county contains 700,000 acres of land, well diversified with\r\ntimber and prairie, uplands and valleys, rivers and lakes, and fertile\r\nenough to sustain a large population. The county was established by\r\nthe Wisconsin legislature in 1853, and originally included much more\r\nterritory than it now contains, new counties having been formed north\r\nand east of its present domain. Indian traders had visited it at an\r\nearlier period, but the first permanent white settlement was made in\r\n1837, and the first pioneer who came with the serious intention of\r\nmaking permanent improvements was Franklin Steele. As Mr. Steele's\r\nhistory is in a great part the history of the early settlement, we\r\ninsert it here, and very nearly in the language of Mr. Steele himself,\r\nas he communicated it to the writer some years since:\r\n\r\n\"I came to the Northwest in 1837, a young man, healthy and ambitious,\r\nto dare the perils of an almost unexplored region, inhabited by\r\nsavages. I sought Fort Snelling (which was at that time an active\r\nUnited States fort) as a point from which to start. In September,\r\n1837, immediately after the treaty was made ceding the St. Croix\r\nvalley to the government, accompanied by Dr. Fitch, of Bloomington,\r\nIowa, we started from Fort Snelling in a bark canoe, also a scow\r\nloaded with tools, supplies and laborers, descended the Mississippi\r\nriver and ascended the St. Croix to the Dalles. We clambered over the\r\nrocks to the Falls, where we made two land claims, covering the Falls\r\non the east side and the approach to it in the Dalles. We built a log\r\ncabin at the Falls, where the Upper Copper trap range crosses the\r\nriver and where the old mill was afterward erected. A second log house\r\nwe built in the ravine at the head of navigation. Whilst building,\r\nfour other parties arrived to make claim to this power. I found the\r\nveritable Joe Brown on the west side of the St. Croix, trading with\r\nthe Indians, a few rods from where Baker & Taylor built their mill\r\n(near the end of the present toll bridge). Brown had also cut pine\r\nlogs, part of which, in 1838, were used by Baker & Taylor, but most of\r\nthem were burned by forest fires on the ground where they were felled.\r\nIn February, 1838, I made a trip to the Falls with a dog team for the\r\nrelief of one Boyce, who was cutting logs at the mouth of Snake river,\r\nand had had some trouble with the Indians. I helped him until he left\r\nthe country. Peshick, a chief of the Chippewas, said, 'We have no\r\nmoney for logs; we have no money for land. Logs can not go.' He said\r\nhe could not control his young men and would not be responsible for\r\ntheir acts.\r\n\r\n\"In the spring of 1838, from Fort Snelling we descended the\r\nMississippi river to Prairie du Chien in bark canoes, thence by\r\nsteamer to St. Louis, Missouri, where a co-partnership was formed by\r\nMessrs. Fitch, of Muscatine, Iowa, Libbey, of Alton, Illinois,\r\nHungerford and Livingston, of St. Louis, Hill and Holcombe, of Quincy,\r\nIllinois, and myself. We chartered the steamer Palmyra, loaded her\r\nwith all the materials with which to build a saw mill, including\r\nmechanics to do the work, and started for the scene of operations.\r\nPlans for procedure, rules and by-laws were discussed and adopted\r\nduring the journey on the steamer, and the new organization was\r\nchristened the St. Croix Falls Lumbering Company. Calvin A. Tuttle was\r\nthe millwright.\"\r\n\r\nThe trip was made in safety, our immediate plans executed, and the\r\nPalmyra was the first steamboat that ever sailed the St. Croix river\r\nand lake. Mr. Steele made an estimate for the construction of the mill\r\nand dam at $20,000, which he submitted to the company. It was\r\naccepted, and Calvin A. Tuttle, a millwright, was placed in charge of\r\nthe work, but Mr. Steele sold his interest to the company before the\r\nmill was completed. On examination of the records we find that W.\r\nLibbey was the first agent of the company. We find also from the same\r\nrecord that Libbey knew little or nothing of the business he had\r\nundertaken. With a few barrels of whisky and one of beads he busied\r\nhimself trading with the Indians. This was the first whisky sold in\r\nthe valley, and it was sold in defiance of government law.\r\n\r\nMuch could be written about this old pioneer company of the Northwest,\r\nand its history, could it be truly written, would contain many\r\nthrilling incidents and scenes worthy of remembrance; but much is\r\nalready forgotten and many of the most prominent actors have passed\r\naway, leaving no record of their lives. The company, as a corporation,\r\npassed through many changes of name and ownership. Its history would\r\nbe a history of litigations, of wranglings and feuds, of losses and\r\ngains, of mistakes, of blunders and of wrongs. In the first place, the\r\nmill was planned by men practically unfitted for such work,\r\ninexperienced in lumbering and unacquainted with the vast expenditures\r\nrequisite for the opening up of a new country, hundreds of miles from\r\nlabor and the supplies needed for manufacturing. There were three\r\nrequisites present, a splendid water power, abundance of timber at\r\nconvenient distances and a healthful climate; but these alone did not\r\nand could not make the enterprise a success. Had practical,\r\nexperienced lumbermen been employed the result might have been\r\ndifferent, but impractical methods, enormous expenses, with no profits\r\nor dividends, caused most of the company to withdraw, forfeiting their\r\nstock in preference to continuing with the prospect of total\r\nbankruptcy. Goods were brought annually, at great expense, from St.\r\nLouis by the large steamers which then controlled the trade of the\r\nMississippi and the St. Croix. The navigation of the St. Croix grew\r\nannually more difficult, the immense number of logs floated down since\r\n1838 wearing away the banks and increasing the number and area of sand\r\nbars and not infrequently obstructing the channel with jams.\r\n\r\nIt is not known exactly how or when the name of St. Croix came to be\r\napplied to the beautiful river bearing it, but La Harpe, in his\r\n\"Louisiana,\" gives the most plausible account of its origin: \"This\r\nname is not ecclesiastical in its associations, but named after\r\nMonsieur St. Croix, who was drowned at its mouth.\" Le Sueur, who\r\nexplored the Upper Mississippi in 1683, says he left a large river on\r\nthe east side, named St. Croix, because a Frenchman of that name was\r\ndrowned at its mouth. As Duluth was the first white man to embark in\r\nthe waters of the St. Croix, descending it in canoes, from near Lake\r\nSuperior, which he did in 1680; and as Hennepin and La Salle ascended\r\nthe Mississippi the same year, the name could not have had an earlier\r\norigin, but may be fixed as given sometime between 1680 and 1683. An\r\nold map in my possession, one hundred and twenty-five years old, gives\r\nthe present name of the river and lake. The St. Croix valley embraces\r\nan area of territory from 20 to 90 miles in width, and about 120 miles\r\nin length. Its northern water, Upper Lake St. Croix, is about 20 miles\r\nfrom Lake Superior. The southern portion is a rich prairie country,\r\ninterspersed with groves of hardwood timber. The more northern portion\r\nis interspersed with groves of pine, tamarack, cedar, balsam and\r\nhardwoods. The whole district, with a small exception, is a cereal\r\ncountry. It abounds in wild meadows, and much of the swampy portion\r\nwill ultimately be utilized by ditching, which will transform it all\r\ninto a good stock raising country. About eight-tenths of this entire\r\nvalley is fitted by nature for agriculture.\r\n\r\nWheat, the leading cereal, averages ten to thirty bushels per acre;\r\nthe growth of tame grasses can not be excelled; vegetables grow to\r\nwonderful size; native wild fruits abound; cultivated fruits are being\r\nsuccessfully introduced; cranberries are being cultivated in the\r\nnorthern part. Wheat, stock, and pine lumber are the principal\r\narticles of export. The southern portion is well watered by the St.\r\nCroix and its tributaries--Kinnikinic, Willow, Apple, Sunrise, and\r\nsmaller streams, lakes and springs. The northern portion is abundantly\r\nwatered by the St. Croix and tributaries--Wolf, Trade, Wood, Clam,\r\nYellow, Namakagan, Rush, Kanabec and Kettle rivers. Small streams and\r\nlakes are numerous, of which only the largest are named on the maps.\r\nThe valley is abundantly supplied with water power, capable of running\r\nenough manufactories to work up all the products of the country. The\r\nsoil is, as a general thing, dry and arable. April and May are the\r\nseeding months. Crops mature, and are seldom injured by frosts. The\r\nwhole country adjacent to this valley will answer to this general\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-ninth day of July, 1837, our government purchased the\r\nvalley of the St. Croix of the Indians at a treaty held at Fort\r\nSnelling, Gov. Henry Dodge and Gen. Wm. R. Smith acting as\r\ncommissioners. The purchase was ratified in Congress in the spring of\r\n1838. Polk county, originally a part of Crawford, in 1840 became a\r\npart of St. Croix, and in 1853 received its present organization and\r\nname, the latter in honor of James K. Polk, eleventh president of the\r\nUnited States. This country occupies the eastern part of the valley\r\nof the St. Croix lying between Burnett and St. Croix counties on the\r\nnorth and south, and Barron on the east, the St. Croix river forming\r\nits western boundary. The surface is agreeably diversified with forest\r\nand prairie land, and is supplied with excellent springs, rivers and\r\nlakes. Most of the underlying rock is sandstone. This rock crops out\r\nalong the banks of the St. Croix and is extensively used for building\r\npurposes. Lime rock is also found along the river banks, some of which\r\nis of a superior grade, notably that below Osceola, which is\r\nmanufactured into lime and exported. The natural scenery can scarcely\r\nbe surpassed in the West. The towering, precipitous bluffs along the\r\nSt. Croix, the picturesque trap rocks of the Dalles, and the bright\r\nclear lakes of the interior have long been an attraction to the\r\ntourist. The lakes and smaller streams abound in fish, and the latter\r\nare famous for their abundance of brook trout.\r\n\r\nThe county seat at the organization of the county was located at St.\r\nCroix Falls. The first election held in the limits of the present\r\ncounty of Polk, prior to its organization, was at St. Croix Falls,\r\nthen a voting precinct, known as Caw-caw-baw-kang, a Chippewa name,\r\nmeaning waterfall. The returns of this election were made to Prairie\r\ndu Chien. I was present at the canvassing of these returns. They were\r\nfound to be accurate. Annually since then elections were held at this\r\npoint and returns made, first to Prairie du Chien, Crawford county,\r\nthen to Stillwater, St. Croix county, to Hudson, St. Croix county, and\r\nto Osceola Mills, Polk county. By an election held in Polk county just\r\nafter its organization the county seat was removed to Osceola Mills,\r\nby a unanimous vote. The records of the first elections can not be\r\nfound, they having been stolen from the safe in 1864. The following\r\ncounty officers were elected in 1853: Isaac Freeland, clerk of court\r\nand register of deeds; E. C. Treadwell, sheriff; Oscar A. Clark,\r\nsurveyor; Wm. Kent, county treasurer; Harmon Crandall, coroner; Nelson\r\nMcCarty, district attorney; J. Freeland, clerk of board of\r\nsupervisors. The first meeting of the board of supervisors was held in\r\nOsceola, in Isaac Freeland's building, where the offices were located\r\nfor many years. The first court was held in the school house, Wyram\r\nKnowlton presiding. Both petit and grand juries were in attendance.\r\nIsaac Freeland was the first attorney admitted to practice. Isaac W.\r\nHale was the first county judge. The first marriage was that of Lewis\r\nBarlow to ---- ----, at St. Croix Falls. The first birth in the county\r\nwas that of Charles Northrup, son of Anson Northrup, at St. Croix\r\nFalls (1844). The first death was that of John Kelly, by drowning\r\n(1839), at St. Croix Falls. The first school in the county was\r\nestablished at St. Croix Falls by Miss Tainter, from Prairie du Chien,\r\nin 1848. The first school house was built in Osceola in 1852, the\r\nsecond at St. Croix Falls in 1861. The first mail, established in\r\n1840, was carried up the St. Croix river by batteaus in summer and by\r\nsleds over the ice in winter. The mail was weekly; the carrier was Dr.\r\nPhilip Aldrich. The first land mail route was in 1847, from Willow\r\nRiver to St. Croix Falls. The mail was carried by Dr. Aldrich through\r\nthe woods. The first stage route was established in 1855. The first\r\ndeed we find of Polk county property is recorded at Prairie du Chien\r\nSept. 2, 1845, from James Purinton to John Witherell, of St. Louis,\r\nMissouri, for $4,933,--a deed of trust covering a saw mill at St.\r\nCroix Falls. The second deed is from Benj. T. Otis to Edmond Johnson,\r\nconveying an undivided interest in a pre-emption claim, known as the\r\nNorthrup or Jerusalem claim, about one mile east of St. Croix Falls,\r\nfor $200. The first deed recorded in the county of old St. Croix was\r\nSept. 29, 1845, from James Purinton, of St. Croix Falls, to John H.\r\nFerguson, of the city of St. Louis, Missouri,--consideration\r\n$1,552,--of St. Croix Falls water power property. The first store was\r\nbuilt in St. Croix Falls in 1839 and stocked with goods by the St.\r\nCroix Falls Company. The first blacksmith shop and the first hotel\r\nwere built at St. Croix Falls. The first grist mill was built at\r\nOsceola in 1853. The first crops were raised at \"Jerusalem,\" the first\r\nfarm in the county, in 1839. \"Jerusalem\" was the farm now owned by Wm.\r\nBlanding, and was early noted as a resort for pleasure seekers, as a\r\nplace for picnics and base ball games. The first pre-emption and entry\r\nof land was made in 1848, by Harmon Crandall, of Farmington. Settlers\r\ncame into the county slowly until about 1866, since which time the\r\npopulation has more rapidly increased.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIQUOR TRAFFIC.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly the greatest curse to the pioneers of a new settlement,\r\nand to the aborigines as well, is the liquor traffic. The Indians,\r\nunder the influence of whisky, became infuriated and were capable of\r\ncommitting any atrocity; the effects upon the whites were not so\r\nviolent but just as surely demoralizing, and in time as fatal. Among\r\ndealers in the vile fluid there was no one more persistent and\r\nunscrupulous than Capt. M. M. Samuels. During the summers of 1848 and\r\n1849 there was no other whisky selling house at the Falls. The\r\ncharacter of the whisky sold was vile beyond description. Mrs. H----\r\nand son informed me that they were employed by Samuels during the\r\nsummer in compounding various roots with tobacco and boiling them, for\r\nthe manufacture of a strong drink that was sold for whisky. Many, both\r\nwhites and Indians, were poisoned by this compound. As an emphatic\r\nevidence against the vileness of the liquor, I append some of the\r\nblighting results:\r\n\r\nA talented young lawyer, Hall by name, from Philadelphia, became\r\ninfatuated with the peculiar whisky furnished by Samuels, and when\r\ninsane from its effects ran from Barlow's boarding house to a high\r\nrock overhanging the St. Croix river, just below the falls, plunged in\r\nand was drowned.\r\n\r\nAnother, named Douglas, under the same influence, tried repeatedly to\r\ndrown himself, when his friends bound him securely with cords. He then\r\nmanaged to stab himself.\r\n\r\nAlexander Livingston, a man who in youth had had excellent advantages,\r\nbecame himself a dealer in whisky, at the mouth of Wolf creek, in a\r\ndrunken melee in his own store was shot and killed by Robido, a\r\nhalf-breed. Robido was arrested but managed to escape justice.\r\n\r\nLivingston, once, when on his way from Wolf creek to Clam falls,\r\nsought refuge in my camp, having with him two kegs of whisky. The\r\nIndians soon collected at the camp in fighting trim and sung and\r\ndanced madly about the door of the cabin, and clamored for\r\nscoot-a-wa-bo (whisky). I refused to allow any whisky to be issued.\r\nThe Indians were furious. Livingston cowered with fear. Foreseeing\r\ntrouble I ordered Nat Tibbetts and Jonathan Brawn to take the kegs and\r\nfollow me. The Indians stopped their gymnastic performances and gazed\r\nintently. With an axe and with a single blow on each keg I knocked in\r\nthe heads, and the whisky was soon swallowed up in the snow. The\r\nIndians sprang forward with demoniac yells and commenced licking up\r\nthe saturated snow, after which they danced around me, calling me\r\n\"Oge-ma\" (captain). I gave them food and they went away sober and\r\napparently satisfied.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRONTIER JUSTICE.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1848 there were two rival whisky sellers at or near\r\nBalsam lake. Miles Tornell, a Norwegian, was located midway between\r\nthe lake and the Falls. Miller, a German, had his post at the lake.\r\nMiller was an older trader, and claimed exclusive rights. A bitter\r\nfeeling sprang up between them, which resulted, as the testimony\r\nafterward proved, in the murder of Tornell. His house was burned, and\r\nhis body found concealed in a coal pit. One McLaughlin, who was\r\nstopping with Tornell, was also murdered. An investigation was set on\r\nfoot. Samuels and Fields acted as detectives, and fixed the crime upon\r\nan Indian, whom they arrested on an island in Blake's lake, and\r\nbrought to the Falls for trial. H. H. Perkins acted as judge, a jury\r\nof good men was impaneled, and the trial was held in Daniel Mears'\r\nstore. A prosecuting attorney and counsel for the accused were\r\nappointed. The Indian frankly confessed the killing, and said that he\r\nhad been hired to do the bloody work by Miller. Another Indian\r\ntestified to being present on the occasion of the murder. After brief\r\nremarks by the lawyers, the jury brought in a verdict of guilty. There\r\nwas no formal sentence. The Indian was kept under guard till next\r\nmorning, when, by the unanimous consent of all present, he was hanged\r\nto a tree, since blighted, that stood near the old burying ground\r\n(later Louisiana street), and was hanged, Samuels officiating as\r\nsheriff. The Indians present were permitted to take the body, which\r\nthey buried with Indian rites. Toward Miller, who ought to have been\r\nheld as principal, the crowd were unexpectedly lenient. Instead of\r\nbeing hanged upon the same tree, he was merely lashed to it, and\r\nflogged, Pat Collins administering fifteen strokes on the bare back\r\nwith a beech withe. He was then placed on a steamboat and ordered to\r\nleave the country, never to return. Of the more active participants in\r\nthe hanging, Pat Collins, who officiated as hangman, and who flogged\r\nMiller, was undeniably a hard citizen. He had a bitter grudge against\r\nMiller, and administered the strokes with a will. He was himself\r\nhanged some years later in California for highway robbery. Chas. F.\r\nRowley, who assisted in the hanging, lived for some years on a farm\r\nat Wolf creek, enlisted in 1861 in the Union army, and was killed in\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOPULATION OF ST. CROIX FALLS IN 1848.\r\n\r\nThe following heads of families resided in St. Croix Falls in 1848: H.\r\nH. Perkins, Edward Worth, G. W. Brownell, Otis Hoyt, J. Saunders, R.\r\nArnold, L. Barlow, A. L. Tuttle, M. M. Samuels, Geo. De Attley, Moses\r\nPerin, and W. H. C. Folsom.\r\n\r\nThe following single men claimed this as their home: D. Mears, J. L.\r\nand N. C. D. Taylor, P. Kelly, A. Romain, J. and W. R. Marshall, W. F.\r\nColby, Dr. De Witt, W. J. Vincent, C. Dexter, A. Youle, H. H.\r\nNewberry, J. and O. Weymouth, Geo. Field, W. W. Folsom, J. H. Tuller,\r\nJ. Dobney, J. Paine, and some others whose names I can not readily\r\nrecall.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURAL LANGUAGE.\r\n\r\nThe Indians, when unable to talk English, nevertheless managed to\r\nexpress themselves intelligibly by gestures, picture writing, and\r\nvocal utterances, imitating the sounds which they wished to describe.\r\nA kind old Chippewa occasionally visited my camp. He would sit by the\r\ncamp fire and mark out in the ashes the outlines of lakes and streams.\r\nIn tracing South Clam river, at a certain point he drew a line across\r\nthe stream, and blew his breath between his teeth and lips in such a\r\nway as to perfectly imitate the sound of falling water. Sometime\r\nafterward, in exploring Clam river, on rounding a curve I heard the\r\nsound of falling water, and found the fall just as he had located it.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DROWNING OF HAMLET H. PERKINS.\r\n\r\nMr. Perkins had been in the village since 1847, acting as agent for\r\nthe Falls company until the winter of 1850-51, when he was\r\naccidentally drowned while attending to his duties. He was engaged in\r\nrepairing the dam, and was standing on a block of ice. In an unguarded\r\nmoment he lost his foothold and was carried by the swift current under\r\nthe ice. It was two days before his body was recovered. His family\r\nleft the valley, taking the body with them.\r\n\r\n\r\nA QUAILTOWN MURDER.\r\n\r\nSt. Croix Falls. The buildings consisted of a dwelling house, whisky\r\nshop, bowling alley, Indian house and stable, the whole\r\ninappropriately styled Quailtown, as the name was a gross slander upon\r\nthe innocent birds. The quails in this \"Partridge\" nest were evil\r\nbirds. The resort was noted for its riotous disorder. The worst\r\nclasses met there for revelry and midnight orgies. In the summer of\r\n1849 Alfred Romain and Patrick Kelly met at Quailtown, disputed,\r\nfought, were parted, and the neat day met by agreement to continue the\r\nfight with pistols. They were to meet at sunrise in front of Daniel\r\nMears' store. An attempt was made to pacify them, but in vain. Only\r\nRomain appeared at the appointed place, and not finding Kelly, hunted\r\nthrough the village for him. About 9 o'clock A. M. he found him at the\r\nhouse of Kimball, a mulatto man. Romain shot him at sight, fatally. At\r\nthe inquest, held by Dr. Hoyt, it was proven that Romain fired four\r\nshots into the body of Kelly, each taking effect, and then crushed his\r\nskull with the pistol, and that Kelly fired one shot at Romain. Romain\r\nwas held for murder, but was never brought to trial. After two years'\r\nconfinement he escaped from the jail at Prairie du Chien.\r\n\r\nRomain afterward removed to St. Louis, reformed his mode of life and\r\nbecame a steady and respectable man. Kelly was a native of Ireland,\r\nand at the time of his death was engaged to be married to an estimable\r\nlady, one of the corps of teachers sent out by Gov. Slade.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINERAL PERMITS.\r\n\r\nIn 1846 a party of speculators, composed of Caleb Cushing, Rufus\r\nChoate, Robert Rantoul, and others, located a mineral permit, one mile\r\nsquare, covering part of the site of the two towns of St. Croix and\r\nTaylor's Falls, with the water power as the centre. Their permit was\r\nfiled in the general land office at Washington. They located another\r\npermit at or near the mouth of Kettle river. As no money was ever\r\nexpended in improving them, these permits were never respected.\r\nSubsequently the government resurveyed the lands and sold them. The\r\npresent title to these lands is perfectly good.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARRIAGE UNDER DIFFICULTIES.\r\n\r\nIn the olden time officers could not always readily be found to\r\nexecute the laws. Parties desiring to be married, being unable to\r\nsecure the services of a minister or justice of the peace, would seek\r\nfor an officer on the other side of the river, get on a raft or boat,\r\ncast off the fastenings and under the concurrent jurisdiction of the\r\nstate and territorial authorities, would be pronounced \"man and wife.\"\r\nParties have had the same rite performed in the winter season while\r\nstanding on the ice of the St. Croix midway between the two shores.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN INDIAN SCARE.\r\n\r\nDuring the excitement following the Indian outbreak, there was a\r\ngeneral feeling of insecurity and alarm. The half-breeds were\r\nespecially apprehensive of some kind of violence. One bright moonlight\r\nevening, at St. Croix, a surveyor was taking some observations, and as\r\nhis instrument glittered brightly in the moonlight, the half-breeds\r\nsaw it and fled, badly frightened, fancying a Sioux behind every bush.\r\nThe whites seeing them running, as if for their lives, caught the\r\npanic, and fled over to the Minnesota side. The Taylor's Falls people\r\nwere aroused from their peaceful slumbers to find, soon after, that it\r\nwas a false alarm. Some of the fugitives hid underneath the bridge and\r\nclung to the trestle work till morning.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST FIRE CANOE.\r\n\r\nI am indebted to Calvin A. Tuttle for the following reminiscence: In\r\nJuly, 1838, the steamer Palmyra, Capt. Middleton, of Hannibal,\r\nMissouri, in command, the first steamer on St. Croix waters, brought\r\nme to St. Croix Falls, landing in the Dalles, east side, opposite\r\nAngle Rock. The snorting of the Palmyra brought many curiosity seeking\r\nIndians to the Dalles. They gathered on the pinnacles of the trap\r\nrock, peered curiously over and jumped back, trembling with fright at\r\nthe \"Scota Cheman\" or \"fire canoe,\" the first that had ever floated on\r\nthe placid waters of the St. Croix. I had been employed as millwright\r\nto erect mills in the new, and, as yet, almost unknown settlement. On\r\nthe Palmyra came the proprietors, Steele, Fitch, Hungerford, Libbey,\r\nLivingston, Hill, and Russell, with mill irons, tools and provisions\r\nfor the enterprise.\r\n\r\n\r\nMILL BUILDING.\r\n\r\nAfter climbing over the cragged rocks we came to an Indian trail which\r\nled to the Falls, where we found two men, Lagoo and Denire holding\r\nthe claim for Steele. The fanciful scheme of building a mill up in the\r\nwild land looked now like a reality. The men lived in a log cabin just\r\nbelow the Falls, in a small clearing in the timber, near a copper rock\r\nrange. Boyce and his men had been driven in by Indians from above.\r\nAndrew Mackey and others of Boyce's men went to work with us.\r\nThirty-six men had come from St. Louis on the steamer Palmyra. We\r\nmoved our machinery from the Dalles to the Falls by water and\r\ncommenced work immediately. Steele's men had been hindered by the\r\nIndians from procuring timber for the building of the mill. We\r\nobtained a supply from Kanabec river, which arrived September 15th.\r\nBuilding the mill and blasting the rock occupied our attention during\r\nthe winter. The mill was soon completed and running. During this\r\nperiod the work was often interrupted and the men were greatly\r\ndemoralized by the threatening behavior of the Indians. Many of them\r\nwere frightened into leaving the settlement, but their places were\r\nsupplied by the company whenever practicable. During 1840 we received\r\nsome reliable accessions, among them J. L. Taylor, John McKusick,\r\nJoseph Haskell, Elam Greely, J. W. Furber and A. McHattie. Some frame\r\nhouses were built near the mill. Washington Libbey was our first\r\nagent, Darnes our second (1839), Capt. W. Frazer our third (1840),\r\nCapt. Wm. Holcombe our fourth (1841). The first death was of a man\r\ndrowned in 1840. The first white woman who visited the Falls was Mrs.\r\nDavid Hone. Rev. Boutwell preached here in 1839. A. Northrup and\r\nfamily came in 1840.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIAN MURDERS.\r\n\r\nIn 1840 Jeremiah Russell, the Indian farmer at Pokegama, Pine county,\r\nMinnesota, sent two Chippewa Indians to St. Croix Falls for supplies,\r\nwho arrived in safety. A band of fifty Sioux Indians were concealed at\r\nthis (St. Croix Falls) settlement for some days. Within an hour after\r\nthe arrival of the two Chippewas, the settlement was surrounded by\r\nthese Sioux. The whites, seeing that trouble was brewing, secreted the\r\nChippewas for two days, the Sioux closely watching. The white men were\r\nrestless, and afraid to go to work. Capt. Frazer, Rev. Ayers and\r\nmyself held a council and explained the situation to the Chippewas,\r\nwho replied that they would not expose the whites to trouble. They\r\nresolved on leaving and started in open day north over the trap rock\r\nridge, thence through the bushes, where they discovered two Sioux. The\r\nChippewas were armed and fired on the Sioux, killing them instantly.\r\nThe Chippewas then started to run. The report of the guns brought\r\nsquads of Sioux immediately in pursuit, who, firing on the Chippewas,\r\nkilled one. The two dead Sioux were sons of Little Crow. They were\r\nplaced by the Sioux in a sitting posture, with backs to a tree, facing\r\nthe enemy's country, on the second bench near where the mill dam was\r\nsubsequently built, a double barreled gun standing on the ground\r\nbetween them. They decorated the corpses with war paint, ribbons and\r\nmosses. The two Chippewas who killed Little Crow's sons bore the\r\ntitles Julius and Wezhaymah. The Sioux in pursuit killed Julius, and\r\nhis head was hung up in a kettle before those he had slain. His body\r\nwas chopped in pieces and scattered to the four winds.\r\n\r\nFrom an historical letter, written by Mrs. E. T. Ayer, who lives at\r\nBelle Prairie, Minnesota, and whom we have elsewhere mentioned, we\r\nhave the following description of the death of the sons of Little\r\nCrow:\r\n\r\n\"Julius was of medium height, stout build, very neat, and when in full\r\ndress very few Indians would favorably compare with him. Being a good\r\nhunter he had the means of gratifying his taste. His hair was long and\r\nabundant, and was kept clean and shining by the frequent use of comb\r\nand brush, with the help of a little marrow or bear's oil. Three or\r\nfour of his numerous long braids, studded with silver brooches, hung\r\ngracefully on both sides of his face and over his arms--the rest of\r\nhis dress in a manner corresponding. His hair, like Absalom's, did not\r\nsave him from his enemies. The Dakotas may dance around it for\r\ngenerations and never see its equal.\r\n\r\n\"Wezhaymah made his appearance at Pokegama. As he drew near the houses\r\nhe gave a salute from his double barreled gun. The Ojibways were much\r\nfrightened. They believed the Sioux had returned to make another trial\r\nfor scalps and plunder. The first impulse of the women was to hide.\r\nThe chief's wife and oldest daughter being at the mission house, went\r\nthrough a trap door into a dark cellar. But when the supposed dead\r\nstood before them, alive and well, there was great rejoicing.\r\n\r\n\"Wezhaymah said that Julius killed both of Little Crow's sons; that\r\nthe Sioux followed him but a short distance, then all turned after\r\nJulius. He took a circuitous route home, traveling in the night and\r\nhiding in the day. Julius' parents, Joseph and Eunice, and other\r\nmembers of their family, were members of the mission church. He and\r\nhis wife made no profession, though they sometimes attended religious\r\nworship.\"\r\n\r\nAbout twenty days after, about one hundred Sioux came from little\r\nCrow's band at Red Rock for the bodies of their dead comrades and the\r\ngun, having first, by means of spies, satisfied themselves that there\r\nwere no Chippewas in the vicinity. One morning, as the whites were\r\ngoing to work, they were surprised by the sudden appearance of these\r\nIndians, who rushed suddenly down upon them from different trails,\r\ngorgeously painted and without blankets. Their movements were so\r\nsudden that the whites were completely surprised, and at the mercy of\r\nthe Indians, who, however, satisfied themselves with searching the\r\ncamp and appropriating all the victuals they could find, ostensibly\r\nsearching for the gun which was not to be found where they had left\r\nit. Complaining bitterly of its loss, they withdrew to a trap rock\r\nledge near by, where they formed a circle, danced, sung and fired\r\nseveral guns into the air. They then asked to see \"Oge-ma,\" the agent,\r\nand formally demanded the gun. Everyone in camp denied any knowledge\r\nwhatever of the missing article. The Indians were at first much\r\ndissatisfied, but finally Little Crow advanced, smoked a pipe and\r\noffered it to. Capt. Frazer, shook hands and withdrew, apparently in\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nAs it is not the custom for Indians to molest the dead, they firmly\r\nbelieved a white man had taken the gun. Little Crow applied to Maj.\r\nPlympton at Fort Snelling, charging the theft upon the whites. The\r\nmajor in turn wrote to Capt. Frazer at the Falls to make an\r\ninvestigation, as a result of which the gun was found in a tool chest\r\nbelonging to Lewis Barlow, concealed under a false bottom. Barlow\r\nprofessed entire innocence and ignorance of the matter, suggesting\r\nthat his brother must have placed the gun there. Capt. Frazer severely\r\nreprimanded him for imperiling the lives of all the whites in the\r\nsettlement by his foolish and thievish act. The gun was sent to Maj.\r\nPlympton, who wrote to Capt. Frazer cautioning him to be on his guard,\r\nas the Indians were much irritated. Barlow had earned the contempt and\r\ndislike of his fellow workmen.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIAN BATTLE OF STILLWATER\r\n\r\nMr. Tuttle was at the Falls at the time of the famous battle between\r\nthe Sioux and Chippewas, which was fought in the ravine where the\r\nMinnesota state prison now stands, July 3, 1839, and has given me the\r\nfollowing account:\r\n\r\nThe Chippewas of the St. Croix had been invited by the officer in\r\ncommand at Fort Snelling to a council, the object of which was to\r\neffect a treaty of peace. Two hundred and fifty or three hundred\r\nChippewas, including their women and children, passed down the St.\r\nCroix in canoes, rested in fancied security in the ravine near the\r\npresent site of Stillwater, and made a portage thence to Fort\r\nSnelling, where, under protection of government soldiers, the council\r\nwas held. The pipe of peace had been smoked and the Chippewas were\r\nquietly returning home, and had encamped a second time in the ravine,\r\nexpecting to re-embark the next morning on the waters of the St.\r\nCroix. Just at the dawn of the ensuing day, and while they were still\r\nasleep, a large body of Sioux, who had stealthily followed them, fell\r\nupon them suddenly, and with wild yells commenced an indiscriminate\r\nslaughter. The Chippewas rallying, drove the Sioux from the ground,\r\nthereby retaining possession of their dead, to the number of about\r\nthirty. After the smoke of peace at Fort Snelling it was reported that\r\na Sioux had been killed. This incensed them so that they followed in\r\ntwo parties, one party pursuing the St. Croix band and another the\r\nMille Lacs band up Rum river. The latter party overtook the Chippewas\r\nat the point where Princeton is now located, and slew sixty of their\r\nnumber. It was afterward ascertained that the Sioux killed near Fort\r\nSnelling was killed by a Pillager of the Upper Mississippi, an Indian\r\nof a band that was not in the council. The Sioux and Chippewas, it is\r\ntrue, are bitter, relentless, hereditary foes, but this slaughter\r\noccurred through a grievous mistake. The Chippewas, on their return,\r\nrested at the Falls. Capt. Frazer gave them medicine, dressed their\r\nwounds and fed them. The Indians gave way to the wildest grief at\r\ntheir losses, and when they heard of the sixty killed of the Mille\r\nLacs band, their mourning cries and moans baffled description.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST LOGGERS.\r\n\r\nThe first logs were cut by J. R. Brown on the Taylor's Falls flat in\r\nthe winter of 1836-37, but the first regular outfit and camp was that\r\nof John Boyce, who came up in a mackinaw boat from St. Louis with\r\neleven men and six oxen, landing at St. Croix Falls late in the fall\r\nof 1837. Mr. Andrew Mackey, who was in his party, has furnished me\r\nwith some items regarding this adventure. The boat was cordelled over\r\nthe rapids, and, with poles and lines, taken as far as the mouth of\r\nKanabec river, where a camp was established. Boyce had considerable\r\ntrouble with the Indians. Little Six, a Chippewa chief, came to the\r\ncamp with two hundred warriors in a defiant, blustering manner,\r\ntelling him to \"go away,\" to \"go back where they came from.\" Boyce\r\nproceeded to the Indian mission at Lake Pokegama and invoked the aid\r\nof Rev. Mr. Boutwell, Ely, Ayers and Seymour, who came back with him\r\nto the camp and had a \"talk\" with Little Six, who claimed that the\r\nwhites had paid no money. Mr. Seymour explained to them the provisions\r\nof the treaty, of which they would soon hear; that under its\r\nprovisions the whites had a right to the timber; that they were not\r\nusurpers, that they would live peaceably and not disturb their game.\r\nThe Indians granted assent, but refused to allow the whites to remove\r\nany of their chingwack (pine). Mr. Seymour, apprehending trouble,\r\nadvised Mr. Boyce to leave. He determined to remain. The Indians being\r\nstill troublesome, Mr. Boyce descended the river to the falls, the\r\nIndians following. On going over the falls the boat filled and Mr.\r\nBoyce lost nearly all he had. The Palmyra shortly after broke the\r\nsilence of the Dalles with its shrill whistle and brought the news of\r\nthe ratification of the treaty by Congress. Boyce sent his boat down\r\nthe river, built small boats and made haste to return to his camp on\r\nKanabec river, where he remained through the fall and winter cutting\r\nlogs.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST RAFTING.\r\n\r\nIn April and May of 1839, Boyce rafted his logs with poles and ropes\r\nmade of basswood strings. The high water swept them away. He gathered\r\nfrom the broken rafts enough for one raft, made it as strong as\r\npossible, and continued the descent. The raft struck upon the first\r\nisland and went to pieces. Boyce saved the canoe and a part of the\r\nprovisions. Boyce was by this time in a furious rage at his want of\r\nsuccess, but tried a third time to make a raft. The crew, tired and\r\nhungry, refused to work. A new contract was made and written on a\r\nslate, there being no paper. The logs were left in the river. Some of\r\nthem floated down and were sold to the Falls company and to the\r\ncompany at Marine. Boyce lost all his labor and investment; the men\r\ngot but little for their work. Frank Steele had assisted in supplying\r\nprovisions and clothing for the men, the value of which he never\r\nreceived. Boyce was disgusted and left the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN INDIAN PAYMENT.\r\n\r\nLevi W. Stratton, who came up on the Palmyra, July, 1838, gives a few\r\nreminiscences from which we select an account of a payment made to the\r\nChippewa Indians the year of his arrival. The crew and passengers of\r\nthe Palmyra had been greatly annoyed by the Indians, who expected\r\ntheir first payment in July, and besieged the boat in great numbers,\r\ndemanding it at the hands of the first whites who had come up the\r\nriver, unable to understand the difference between the regularly\r\nconstituted authorities and those immigrants who had nothing to do\r\nwith the payments. It was not until the first week of November that\r\ntheir goods came for payment. The place where Stillwater now stands\r\nwas selected as the place where they should assemble.\r\n\r\nThe old stern wheel Gipsey brought the goods and landed them on the\r\nbeach. The Chippewas came there to the number of 1,100 in their\r\ncanoes, nearly starved by waiting for their payment. While there\r\nreceiving it the river and lake froze up, and a deep snow came on;\r\nthus all their supplies, including one hundred barrels of flour,\r\ntwenty-five of pork, kegs of tobacco, bales of blankets, guns and\r\nammunition, casks of Mexican dollars, etc., all were sacrificed except\r\nwhat they could carry off on their backs through the snow hundreds of\r\nmiles away. Their fleet of birch canoes they destroyed before leaving,\r\nlest the Sioux might have the satisfaction of doing the same after\r\nthey left.\r\n\r\nMany of the old as well as the young died from overeating, they being\r\nnearly starved. Thus their first payment became a curse rather than a\r\nblessing to them, for their supplies soon gave out, the season for\r\nhunting was past, they were away from home and had no means of getting\r\nthere, except by wading through deep snow. Many perished in the\r\nattempt. As is usual in such cases, I suppose, no one was to blame,\r\nbut the poor Indians had to suffer the consequences of somebody's\r\nneglect. The old Gipsey had scarcely time to get through the lake\r\nbefore the ice formed.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIAN DANCING AND THEFT.\r\n\r\nIn the rough log cabin at St. Croix Falls were three females, the\r\nwives of Messrs. Orr and Sackett, employes of the company, and Miss\r\nYoung, daughter of a widower of that name. Life in that cabin was by\r\nno means a dream of bliss, for in consequence of the mosquitoes, more\r\nrelentless persecutors than the Indians, a smudge had to be kept\r\nburning night and day, or at least by day when the sun was not\r\nshining. The old cabin served for a kitchen, while an arbor was\r\nimprovised outside for a dining room. Shortly after the arrival of the\r\nimmigrants, and before they had learned all the peculiarities of\r\nIndian character, they were visited by a party of fifteen or twenty\r\nbraves, who set about adorning themselves, and spent the forenoon in\r\npainting and getting themselves up in gorgeous rig, regardless of\r\nexpense, preparatory to giving a free entertainment. Just before\r\ndinner was called, they arranged themselves near the table and gave a\r\ndance, which was very much applauded, after which they were given\r\npresents of bread and meat, and dismissed, apparently highly pleased\r\nwith the success of their exhibition. The household gathered about the\r\ntable to enjoy their repast, but to their consternation, not a knife,\r\nfork or spoon could be found. While the majority of the Indians were\r\nriveting the attention of the new comers by their extraordinary\r\nantics, the remainder were quietly abstracting the tableware. They\r\nwere afterward charged with the theft, but protested innocence. The\r\nmissing articles were never heard of again. A pig of lead, left\r\noutside, disappeared at the same time. The poor Indians denied ever\r\nhaving seen the lead. Mr. Stratton remarked, however, that all their\r\nwar clubs, pipes and gun stocks had been lately and elaborately\r\nornamented with molten lead.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER THEFTS.\r\n\r\nAt another time, shortly before payment, when the Indians were\r\nunusually hungry and troublesome, two barrels of pork and one of\r\nbutter mysteriously disappeared. The pork barrels were found empty in\r\nthe river, and also the butter barrel with one-third of the contents\r\nmissing. The Indians lay all day in camp sick, but protested their\r\ninnocence. Nevertheless, at payment day a claim of two hundred dollars\r\nfor the pork and one hundred and fifty for the butter was allowed and\r\nkept back. They made no objections to paying for the pork, but\r\nprotested against paying for the butter, as it did them no good and\r\nmade them all sick.\r\n\r\nIn September, an old Indian came to the cabin, begging for something\r\nto eat. The agent went to the pork barrel and held up a fine piece of\r\npork weighing about twelve pounds, to which the tail was still\r\nattached. At sight of this his countenance fell and he went away\r\nsilently and sullenly.\r\n\r\nShortly afterward a yoke of oxen was missing. They had been driven off\r\nover some bare ledges of trap to break the trail. An Indian was hired\r\nto hunt for them. He found that this same beggar who had been so\r\ndisgusted with the offer of a piece of pork with the tail attached had\r\ndriven them off and slaughtered them. Payment day made all right, and\r\nthe Indians were compelled to pay a good price for rather poor beef.\r\n\r\n\r\nHARD TIMES.\r\n\r\nMrs. Mary C. Worth communicated to the writer the following incidents,\r\nillustrating some of the vicissitudes of the early settlers:\r\n\r\nIt was in the fall of 1842. There were about two hundred people in the\r\nvillage, most of them in the employ of James Purinton, company agent.\r\nThey were already short of provisions and the winter was rapidly\r\ncoming on, and the expected boat, with its cargo of provisions for the\r\nwinter supply, was long delayed. September passed, October came and\r\nnearly passed, and still no boat. Snow covered the ground, and thin\r\nice the river. The ice, in finely broken pieces, floated down the\r\nrapids and was beginning to gorge in the Dalles, and still no boat.\r\nProvisions were allotted to the resident families, and the gloomiest\r\nanticipations filled all minds at the prospect of the long, dreary\r\nwinter without food; when, on the twenty-eighth of October, the long\r\nexpected whistle was heard from the coming steamer. The people rushed\r\nfrantically down to the old warehouse, but the ice was so gorged in\r\nthe Dalles that no boat could make the landing. No boat was in sight,\r\nnor was the whistle heard again. Had it all been an illusion? The\r\neager throng were again in despair. Another night of cold would\r\nblockade the river. Just then the voices of white men were heard from\r\nthe rocks of the Dalles, and to their great joy they perceived the\r\nboat's officers and passengers clambering down from the rocks, with\r\nthe glad tidings that the boat had reached the landing, half a mile\r\nbelow, and was then unloading her cargo. The boat, as soon as\r\nunloaded, hurriedly departed to avoid being frozen in. The winter\r\npassed merrily enough, but clouds and darkness gathered in the spring.\r\nProvisions were again short, and had to be apportioned sparingly and\r\nequally. Occasionally a deer or a fish eked out the supply, but\r\nstarvation was again imminent. On this occasion they were relieved by\r\nthe reception of condemned pork from Fort Snelling. The St. Louis\r\nproprietors sent up another boat load of supplies after the opening of\r\nnavigation, and all seemed well, when, during the prevalence of high\r\nwater, the boom and mill race gave way and the logs, their main\r\ndependence, were swept down the river and beyond their control. This\r\nimportant occurrence, as it then seemed to be, opened up for the\r\ncompany and people a new trade from the valley below, which has been a\r\nsource of immense profit. It suggested the idea of booming and rafting\r\ntheir logs for points down the river, and led to the building of the\r\nfirst saw mill at Stillwater.\r\n\r\n\r\nUGH! UGH!\r\n\r\nMr. Purinton at one time invited a few noted Indians who were begging\r\nfor food to be seated at his table. He politely asked them if they\r\nwould have tea or coffee. \"Ugh! Ugh!\" (equivalent to yes, yes) replied\r\nthe whole party. So Mr. Purinton mixed their tea and coffee.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. WORTH AND MUCKATICE.\r\n\r\nMuckatice, a Chippewa chief, heard that a barrel of whisky had been\r\nstored for safe keeping in the cellar of Mrs. Worth, at Balsam Lake.\r\nMuckatice forced himself into the house and attempted to raise the\r\ncellar trap door. Mrs. Worth forbade him and placed herself upon the\r\ndoor. Muckatice roughly pushed her aside. He raised the trap door,\r\nand, while in the act of descending, fell. While falling Mrs. Worth\r\nsuddenly shut the trap door upon him, by which one of his legs was\r\ncaught. Mrs. Worth held the door tightly down. When at last Muckatice\r\nwas released, gathering a crowd of Indians he returned and demanded\r\nthe whisky. Thayer, with ropes, managed to get the barrel out of the\r\ncellar and out upon the ground, and seeing the peril of giving so much\r\nwhisky to the Indians, knocked in both heads of the barrel with an\r\naxe, and the earth drank the poisonous fluid. Muckatice then shook\r\nhands with Mrs. Worth, called her very brave, and departed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nBIOGRAPHIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe biographical histories of the early settlers of Polk county\r\nconsiderably antedate the organization of the towns to which they\r\nwould be referred as at present belonging, and we therefore group\r\ntogether those earliest identified with the history of the valley, and\r\nits first settlement at St. Croix Falls, referring also some, such as\r\nJoseph R. Brown, Gov. W. R. Marshall and Frank Steele, to localities\r\nin which they had been more intimately connected.\r\n\r\nGOV. WM. HOLCOMBE was one of the active resident proprietors and agent\r\nof the St. Croix Falls Lumber Company from 1838 to 1845. He was born\r\nat Lambertville, New Jersey, in 1804; left home when a boy; went to\r\nUtica, New York, where he learned the wheelwright trade. He married\r\nMartha Wilson, of Utica; moved to Columbus, Ohio, and was successful\r\nin business, but lost all by fire, when he moved to Cincinnati, and\r\nfrom thence to Galena. While in Galena he embarked in steamboating on\r\nthe Mississippi. Mrs. Holcombe died in Galena. From Galena he came to\r\nSt. Croix Falls, where he devoted his time as agent to selling lumber\r\nand keeping books. Mr. Holcombe took a deep interest in opening the\r\nvalley to public notice and improvement. He traveled over the\r\nwilderness country from Prairie du Chien to St. Croix Falls before\r\nthere was a blazed path, driving horses and cattle. He helped locate\r\nthe two first roads in the valley from the mouth of St. Croix lake,\r\nvia Marine, to St. Croix Falls and from St. Croix Falls, via Sunrise\r\nand Rush lakes, to Russell's farm, on Pokegama lake. He supervised the\r\ncultivation of the first crops raised in Polk county, at Jerusalem.\r\nHe settled in Stillwater in 1846, where he became an active worker in\r\nbehalf of education, and did much to establish the present excellent\r\nsystem of schools. In 1846 he was a member of the first constitutional\r\nconvention of Wisconsin Territory, representing this valley and all\r\nthe country north of Crawford county. He was a faithful worker on the\r\nboundary question, and effected a change from the St. Croix to a point\r\nfifteen miles due east, from the most easterly point on Lake St.\r\nCroix, from thence south to the Mississippi river and north to the\r\nwaters of Lake Superior. His course was approved by his constituents.\r\nIn 1848 he took an active part in the formation of Minnesota\r\nTerritory, and was secretary of the first convention called for that\r\npurpose in Stillwater. He was receiver of the United States land\r\noffice at Stillwater four years. He was a member of the Democratic\r\nwing of the constitutional convention for Minnesota in 1857, and was\r\nhonored by being elected first lieutenant governor of Minnesota in\r\n1857. The name of Gov. Holcombe will long be remembered in the valley\r\nof the St. Croix. He died in Stillwater, Sept. 5, 1870, and was buried\r\nwith masonic honors. He left two sons, William W. and Edward Van\r\nBuren, by his first wife. He married a second wife in Galena, in 1847,\r\nwho died in 1880.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM S. HUNGERFORD was born in Connecticut, Aug. 12, 1805. He was\r\nmarried to Lucinda Hart, at Farmington, Connecticut, in 1827. He came\r\nto St. Louis, Missouri, at an early age and engaged in mercantile\r\npursuits in the firm of Hungerford & Livingston. In 1838 he became one\r\nof the original proprietors of the St. Croix Falls Lumbering Company,\r\nand gave his time and talents to its welfare. He was of a hopeful\r\ntemperament, and even in the darkest hour of the enterprise in which\r\nhe had embarked, cherished a most cheerful faith in its ultimate\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nHon. Caleb Cushing, whose name was to be associated intimately with\r\nthat of Mr. Hungerford in the future history and litigation of the\r\ncompany, recognizing St. Croix Falls as a point promising unrivaled\r\nattractions to the manufacturer, in 1846 purchased an interest in the\r\ncompany, which was at once reorganized with Cushing and Hungerford as\r\nprincipal stockholders. The acute mind of Gen. Cushing recognized not\r\nonly the prospective advantages of the water power, but the\r\nprobability of the division of Wisconsin Territory, which might result\r\nin making St. Croix Falls the capital of the new territory, and\r\nformed plans for the development of the company enterprise, which\r\nmight have resulted advantageously had not he been called away to take\r\npart in the Mexican War and thence to go on a political mission to\r\nChina. During his absence there was a complete neglect of his American\r\ninland projects and the enterprise at St. Croix suffered greatly; the\r\nnew company accomplished but little that was agreed upon in the\r\nconsolidation. Cushing had inexperienced agents, unfitted to attend to\r\nhis interest. He furnished money sufficient, if judiciously handled,\r\nto have made a permanent, useful property here. Conflicting questions\r\narose between Hungerford and Cushing's agents, which terminated in\r\nlawsuits. The first suit was in 1848, Hungerford, plaintiff. Different\r\nsuits followed, one after another, for over twenty years, which cursed\r\nthe property more than a mildew or blight. During this time the\r\nparties alternated in use and possession, by order of court.\r\nHungerford, during these trials, pre-empted the land when it came in\r\nmarket. For this he was arrested on complaint of perjury. Hungerford,\r\nby order of court, was, on his arrest, taken away in chains. He was\r\nsoon after released. Hungerford was an indefatigable worker. The labor\r\nof his life was invested in the improvements of the company. Cushing,\r\nbeing a man of talent and influence, could fight the battle at a\r\ndistance. He employed the best legal talent in the land; he met\r\nHungerford at every turn, and Hungerford became a foe worthy of his\r\nsteel. They unitedly accomplished the ruin of their town. Mr.\r\nHungerford had an excellent family, making their home at the Falls\r\nduring all their perplexities. On the occasion of his arrest he was\r\nmanacled in presence of his family, who bore it with a fortitude\r\nworthy the name and reputation of the father and husband. The\r\nlitigation ended only with the death of the principal actors. The\r\nperishable part of the property, mills and other buildings, has gone\r\nto ruin. The whole history is a sad comment on the folly of attempting\r\nto manage great enterprises without harmony of action and purpose. Mr.\r\nHungerford died in Monticello, Illinois, in 1874. Mrs. Hungerford died\r\nin Connecticut in 1880. Mr. Cushing died in 1876.\r\n\r\nHON. HENRY D. BARRON.--Henry Danforth Barron was born in Saratoga\r\ncounty, New York, April 10, 1832. He received a common school\r\neducation, studied law, and graduated from the law school at Ballston\r\nSpa, New York. He came to Wisconsin in 1851; learned the printer's\r\ntrade, and was afterward editor of the Waukesha _Democrat_. In 1857 he\r\nremoved to Pepin, Wisconsin, and in 1860 received the appointment of\r\ncircuit judge of the Eighth district.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1861, he came to St. Croix Falls, as agent for Caleb\r\nCushing and the St. Croix Manufacturing and Improvement Company.\r\n\r\nHe was elected to the lower house of the Wisconsin legislature in\r\n1862, and served as assemblyman continuously from 1862 to 1869, and\r\nfor the years 1872 and 1873. During the sessions of 1866 and 1873 he\r\nwas speaker of the assembly. A portion of this time he held the\r\nresponsible position of regent of the State University, and was also a\r\nspecial agent of the treasury department. In 1869 President Grant\r\nappointed him chief justice of Dakota, which honor was declined. The\r\nsame year he was appointed fifth auditor in the treasury department,\r\nwhich office he resigned in 1872 to take a more active part in\r\nadvancing the interests of his State. He was chosen a presidential\r\nelector in 1868, and again in 1872, and served as state senator during\r\nthe sessions of 1874, 1875 and 1876, and was at one time president\r\n_pro tem_. of the senate. In 1876 he was elected judge of the Eleventh\r\nJudicial circuit. During his service as judge he was highly gratified\r\nthat so few appeals were taken from his decisions, and that his\r\ndecisions were seldom reversed in higher courts. He had also held the\r\noffices of postmaster, county attorney, county judge, and county\r\nsuperintendent of schools.\r\n\r\nAlthough formerly a Democrat, at the outbreak of the Rebellion he\r\nbecame a Republican. Of late years he was a pronounced stalwart.\r\nThroughout his life he never received any profit, pecuniarily, from\r\nthe prominent positions in which he was placed, his only endeavor\r\nseeming to be to advance the interests, influence, worth and ability\r\nof the younger men with whom he was associated, and hundreds who\r\nto-day hold positions of prominence and responsibility, owe their\r\nsuccess and advancement to his teachings and advice. Of a disposition\r\nkind, courteous and generous, he was possessed of a remarkably\r\nretentive memory, which, with his intimate associations with leading\r\nmen, and familiarity with public life, legislative and judicial,\r\nafforded a fund of personal sketches, anecdotes and biographies, at\r\nonce entertaining, amusing and instructive.\r\n\r\nThe judge was twice married, his first wife having died at Waukesha,\r\nleaving him an only son, Henry H. Barron, who was with him at the time\r\nof his death. His second marriage was to Ellen K. Kellogg, at Pepin,\r\nin 1860. For some time she has made her home with her mother in\r\nCalifornia, on account of ill health. At the time of his death, which\r\noccurred at St. Croix Falls, Jan. 22, 1882, he was judge of the\r\nEleventh Judicial circuit. His remains were buried at Waukesha.\r\n\r\nGEORGE W. BROWNELL.--Mr. Brownell, though not among the earliest of\r\nthe pioneers of St. Croix valley, yet deserves special mention on\r\naccount of his scientific attainments, his high character as a man,\r\nand the fact that he was an influential member, from the St. Croix\r\ndistrict, of the Wisconsin territorial constitutional convention, he\r\nhaving been elected over Bowron on the question of establishing the\r\nnew state line east of the St. Croix.\r\n\r\nMr. Brownell was born in Onondago, New York, and when a youth lived in\r\nSyracuse, where he learned the trade of a carriage maker. He was a\r\nresident of Galena, Illinois, over thirty years, where he engaged in\r\nmining and geological pursuits. He spent two years in the lead mines\r\nof Wisconsin. He was connected with the Galena _Gazette_ some years.\r\nIn 1846 he visited the Superior copper mining region for a Boston\r\ncompany. He formed the acquaintance of Caleb Cushing, Rufus Choate,\r\nHorace Rantoul, and others, and located for them mineral permits at\r\nSt. Croix Falls and Kettle river, and became, this year, a resident of\r\nSt. Croix Falls. In 1847 he was married to Mrs. Duncan, of Galena. He\r\nwas elected this year to the constitutional convention. In 1851 he\r\nreturned to Galena and engaged in the grain trade and cotton planting\r\nnear Vicksburg, Mississippi, in which he was not successful. In 1865\r\nhe visited Colorado and made investments there. When on a trip to\r\nColorado, in 1866, the stage was attacked by Indians. Brownell and\r\nanother passenger alighted to resist the attack. He was armed with a\r\nrifle, and, if properly supported, would probably have been saved; but\r\nmost of the passengers remained in the stage. The driver, getting\r\nscared, whipped his horses and drove rapidly away, leaving Brownell\r\nand companion, who were overpowered and killed. Their bodies were\r\nrecovered, shockingly mutilated. His remains were forwarded to Galena\r\nfor burial. Mr. Brownell had a scientific mind, and passed much of\r\nhis life in scientific studies and practical experiments. He attained\r\na good knowledge of geology, mineralogy and chemistry. The foresight\r\nof Mr. Brownell on the Wisconsin boundary, and in other public\r\nmatters, has been, in time, generally recognized. He was a good\r\nneighbor and kind friend.\r\n\r\nCOL. ROBERT C. MURPHY.--Col. Murphy, a man of fine address and\r\nadmirable social qualities, made his home at St. Croix Falls in\r\n1860-61 and 62, during which time he was in charge of the Cushing\r\ninterest and property, which position he left to accept the colonelcy\r\nof the Eighth Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry. His military career was\r\nnot fortunate and its abrupt termination was a sad disappointment to\r\nhimself and friends. An article in the Milwaukee _Weekly Telegraph_,\r\nfrom the pen of one who knew Col. Murphy well, thus sums up some of\r\nthe salient points in his character and career. We make a few\r\nextracts:\r\n\r\n\"Col. Murphy was educated and accomplished. He had been instructed in\r\nthe Patridge Military School, and was possessed of some experience in\r\nIndian fights on the plains with Burnside, bearing scars of that\r\nexperience, and a recommendation of skill and courage from Gen.\r\nBurnside to Gov. Randall. His great intuitiveness, his ready manner,\r\nhis cultivation of mind, gained for him the respect and charity of his\r\nsuperiors, and brought him the respect and confidence of his regiment.\r\nHis father, a native of Ireland, was a successful practicing lawyer\r\nand politician in Ohio, without much education; a man of strong\r\nnatural talent and integrity. Upon his son he showered all his\r\nearnings, in the form of that which the father lacked the most--books,\r\nschooling and polish. Judge Murphy (the father) was the bearer of\r\nimportant dispatches to Texas from the Tyler and Polk administrations\r\nin connection with the annexation of that republic to this country,\r\nand is referred to in Benton's 'Thirty Years' as Tyler's 'midnight\r\nmessenger.' Young Murphy was appointed by President Pierce American\r\nconsul in China, while Gen. Caleb Cushing was minister to that\r\ncountry, and he discharged important consular and judicial duties\r\nthere with credit to himself and his government. Upon his return Gen.\r\nCushing selected him to take charge of the Cushing interest and\r\nproperty at St. Croix Falls, in this State. From there he went 'to the\r\nfront,' and his military career was cut short by his failure at Iuka\r\nand Holly Springs. Gen. Grant dismissed him in brief, terse words, but\r\nwas willing afterward that he should be heard by a board of army\r\nofficers detailed for that purpose. Stanton was inexorable and\r\nrefused.\"\r\n\r\nAfter his dismissal from the army he removed to Washington and\r\naccepted a clerkship in the post office department where he still\r\nremains. It is due to him to say that his own version of his military\r\ntroubles is ingenious and plausible, and would, if sustained, quite\r\nexonerate him from the charges that have pressed so heavily upon him.\r\n\r\nEDWARD WORTH.--Mr. Worth came to St. Croix Falls from New York State\r\nin 1842, where he continued to reside the remainder of his life,\r\nexperiencing the vicissitudes of pioneer life to their fullest extent.\r\nHe died in 1863, leaving a widow, an only son (Henry) and two\r\ndaughters, Myra, wife of W. T. Vincent, and Sarah, wife of John\r\nBlanding.\r\n\r\nMRS. MARY C. WORTH.--Mrs. Worth was born Oct. 14, 1812, was married to\r\nEdward Worth, Dec. 24, 1835, and came to St. Croix Falls in 1842,\r\nwhere she lived till Jan. 12, 1886, when she peacefully passed away.\r\nShe was a woman of rare mental ability, untiring industry and skill in\r\nmanaging her household affairs, and unquestioned courage, as many\r\nincidents in her St. Croix experience will evidence. She was a member\r\nof the Episcopal church and went to her grave with the respect and\r\nadmiration of all who knew her.\r\n\r\nMAURICE MORDECAI SAMUELS, better known as Capt. Samuels, was born in\r\nLondon, of Jewish parentage. It is not known exactly when he came to\r\nthis country. I first met him in 1844, at Prairie du Chien, at which\r\ntime he was a traveling peddler. In 1846 I found him in the Chippewa\r\ncountry, living with an Indian woman and trading with the Indians at\r\nthe mouth of Sunrise river. In 1847 he established a ball alley and\r\ntrading post at St. Croix Falls, where he lived until 1861, when he\r\nraised a company (the St. Croix Rifles) for the United States service,\r\nreceived a commission and served till the close of the war. After the\r\nwar he became a citizen of New Orleans, and in 1880 changed his\r\nresidence to Winfield, Kansas. While in St. Croix he reared a family\r\nof half-breed children. He was a shrewd man and an inveterate dealer\r\nin Indian whisky. Capt. Samuels was sent as a government agent to the\r\nChippewas of St. Croix valley and the southern shore of Lake\r\nSuperior, in 1862, to ascertain and report their sentiment in regard\r\nto the Sioux war. It may be said of Capt. Samuels that, however\r\nunprincipled he may have been, he was no dissembler, but outspoken in\r\nhis sentiments, however repellant they may have been to the moral\r\nsense of the community. He died at Winfield, Kansas, in 1884.\r\n\r\nJOSEPH B. CHURCHILL was born in New York in 1820; was married in New\r\nYork to Eliza Turnbull, and came to St. Croix Falls in 1854. He has\r\nfilled various offices creditably, and has the respect and confidence\r\nof his acquaintances. His oldest daughter is the wife of Phineas G.\r\nLacy, of Hudson. His second daughter is the wife of Joseph Rogers. He\r\nhas one son living.\r\n\r\nJOHN MCLEAN.--Mr. McLean was born 1819, in Vermont; was married in\r\n1844 to Sarah Turnbull and settled on his farm near St. Croix Falls in\r\n1850. Through untiring industry and honorable dealing he has secured a\r\nsufficiency for life, a handsome farm and good buildings. A large\r\nfamily has grown up around him, and have settled in the county.\r\n\r\nGILMAN JEWELL came from New Hampshire; was married in New Hampshire\r\nand came to the West in 1847. He settled on a farm near St. Croix\r\nFalls. He died in 1869. Mrs. Jewell died January, 1888. One son,\r\nPhilip, resides on the homestead. Ezra, another son, resides at the\r\nFalls. The other members of the family have moved elsewhere.\r\n\r\nELISHA CREECH was born in West Virginia, 1831. He came to St. Croix\r\nFalls in 1849, and was married to Mary M. Seeds in 1863. They have\r\nfour children. Mr. Creech has been engaged much of his life in\r\nlumbering. Through industry and temperate habits he has made a good\r\nfarm and a pleasant home.\r\n\r\nJAMES W. MCGLOTHLIN was born in Kentucky; came to St. Croix Falls in\r\n1846, and engaged successfully in sawing lumber at the St. Croix mill\r\nin 1846 and 1847, but in 1848 rented the mill, being sustained by\r\nWaples & Co., of Dubuque, Iowa, but by reason of bad management, he\r\nfailed and left the valley in 1849. He afterward went to California,\r\nwhere he met a tragic fate, having been murdered by his teamster.\r\n\r\nANDREW L. TUTTLE.--Mr. Tuttle came to St. Croix Falls in 1849, and was\r\nengaged many years as a lumberman and as keeper of a boardinghouse. He\r\nsettled on his farm at Big Rock in 1856, where he made himself a\r\ncomfortable home. He went to Montana in 1865, and died there in 1873.\r\nMrs. Tuttle still resides at the homestead, an amiable woman, who has\r\nacted well her part in life. One of her daughters is married to Wm. M.\r\nBlanding. One son, Eli, died in 1883, another son, Henry, died in\r\nMontana. Perly, John and Warren are settled near the homestead.\r\n\r\nJOHN WEYMOUTH was born at Clinton, Maine, in 1815, and came to St.\r\nCroix Falls in 1846, where he followed lumbering and made himself a\r\nbeautiful home on the high hill overlooking the two villages of St.\r\nCroix Falls and Taylor's Falls. By frugality and industry Mr. Weymouth\r\nhas accumulated a competence. He was married in St. Croix Falls in\r\n1850, to Mary McHugh. One son, John, is married to Miss Ramsey, of\r\nOsceola, and a daughter, Mary J., is married to Samuel Harvey, of St.\r\nCroix Falls.\r\n\r\nB. W. REYNOLDS, a tall, thin, stoop-shouldered man of eccentric\r\nmanners, was receiver at the St. Croix land office from 1861 to 1864.\r\nHe was a native of South Carolina, and a graduate of Middlebury\r\nCollege, Vermont. He had studied for the ministry, and, if we mistake\r\nnot, had devoted some years of his life to pastoral work, but devoted\r\nlater years to secular pursuits. At the close of the war he returned\r\nto South Carolina as a reconstructionist, but in two or three years\r\ncame North, and located at La Crosse, Wisconsin, where he edited the\r\nLa Crosse _Star_. He died at La Crosse Aug. 17, 1877.\r\n\r\nAUGUSTUS GAYLORD.--Mr. Gaylord was a merchant in St. Croix Falls prior\r\nto the Rebellion. In 1861 Gov. Harvey appointed him adjutant general\r\nof the State. In this office he acquitted himself well. He was an\r\nefficient public officer and in private life a high minded, honorable\r\ngentleman.\r\n\r\nJAMES D. REYMERT.--Mr. Reymert was born in Norway in 1821, and came to\r\nAmerica and settled in Racine in 1845. He was a practical printer, and\r\neditor of the first Norwegian paper west of the lakes, if not the\r\nfirst in America, and was a man of recognized literary ability. He was\r\na member of the second Wisconsin constitutional convention, 1847, from\r\nRacine. In 1849 he was a member of the Wisconsin assembly. He came to\r\nSt. Croix Falls in 1859, and served two years as agent of the St.\r\nCroix Falls Company. He was the organizer of a company in New York\r\nCity, known as \"The Great European-American Land Company,\" in which\r\nCount Taub, of Norway, took an active part. This noted company\r\nclaimed to have purchased the Cushing property, a claim true only so\r\nfar as the preliminary steps of a purchase were concerned. For a time\r\nthere was considerable activity. The town of St. Croix Falls was\r\nresurveyed, new streets were opened, and magnificent improvements\r\nplanned, but failing to consummate the purchase, the company failed,\r\nleaving a beggarly account of unpaid debts.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM J. VINCENT.--Mr. Vincent is of Irish descent. He was born June\r\n10, 1830, and came West when a youth. In 1846, at the age of sixteen,\r\nhe enlisted in Company H, Mounted Rifles, and served through the\r\nMexican War. In 1848 he came to St. Croix Falls, where he followed\r\nlumbering and clerking. He was married to Myra Worth in 1855. In 1861\r\nhe enlisted in Company F, First Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry, of which\r\ncompany he was appointed second lieutenant. He resigned in 1862.

In\r\n1879 he served as representative in the Wisconsin assembly. In 1880 he\r\ncommenced selling goods with his son-in-law, under the firm name of\r\nVincent & Stevenson. He erected the first brick store building in St.\r\nCroix Falls in 1884.\r\n\r\nTHOMPSON BROTHERS.--Thomas Thompson was born in Lower Canada, Nov. 11,\r\n1833, and was married to Eliza Clendenning in 1861. James Thompson was\r\nborn in Lower Canada, Nov. 11, 1840, and was married to Mary A. Gray\r\nin 1871. The brothers came to the Falls in 1856 and engaged in\r\nlumbering about ten years, and then in merchandising, jointly, but in\r\n1868 formed separate firms. Thomas built the first brick dwelling\r\nhouse in St. Croix in 1882. Mrs. Thomas Thompson died in 1886. James\r\nerected a large flour mill in 1879.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM AMERY was born in London, England, in 1831. He learned the\r\ncarpenter's trade in London and came to America in 1851, locating at\r\nfirst in Stillwater, but the ensuing year removing to St. Croix Falls.\r\nHe pre-empted the southeast quarter of the southwest quarter of\r\nsection 31, township 34, range 18, and adjoining lands in 1853, and\r\nthis has been his continuous home since. He has served as county\r\ntreasurer four years and held many town offices. He was married to\r\nSarah Hackett in 1855. The town of Amery is named in honor of this\r\nrespected man. Mr. Amery died Sept. 4, 1887, leaving a widow, two sons\r\nand three daughters.\r\n\r\nLEWIS BARLOW.--Among the first immigrants to St. Croix Falls was Lewis\r\nBarlow, an eccentric, sensitive man. He was a millwright, and, being\r\nof an unhappy disposition, led a troubled life. He was the first man\r\nmarried at the Falls. In 1847 he moved to the Minnesota side, where he\r\nowned considerable land. He lived here until 1852 when his family left\r\nhim. He sold his interests and followed and reunited them at Rock\r\nIsland, Illinois. Here he suffered much and became blind. He traveled\r\nwith a panorama and so earned a scanty livelihood. In later life he\r\nrevisited his old home at the Falls, but broken and dejected in\r\nspirit. He died at Rock Island in 1872.\r\n\r\nLEVI W. STRATTON.--Mr. Stratton was one of the passengers of the\r\nPalmyra in 1838. He worked for the St. Croix Company two years. After\r\nleaving the Falls, he changed his residence several times, and finally\r\nsettled at Excelsior, Hennepin county, Minnesota, where he died in\r\n1884.

He\r\nwas candidate for judge of the district court in 1850, but was\r\ndefeated. He subsequently settled in Stillwater, and later in Hudson,\r\nwhere he died in 1857, leaving a wife and one son, who became a civil\r\nengineer and died in St. Paul in 1885, and one daughter, Helen, who\r\nachieved some reputation as a writer for periodicals.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL FIELD was born June 8, 1806. He came from a New England\r\nfamily, his father and mother having resided in Connecticut. In early\r\nlife he removed to New York and resided awhile at Rochester. He\r\nengaged principally in transportation business. The earliest work he\r\never did was on the Erie canal. He was married in 1833 to Miss\r\nReynolds, who died in 1874. His children are Capt. Silas Wright Field\r\n(mortally wounded at Shiloh), Norton, a resident of Racine, Wisconsin,\r\nMrs. Fanny Nason, wife of Hon. Joel F. Nason, Phebe and Mary,\r\nunmarried and resident in Brooklyn. Mr. Field was married to his\r\nsecond wife, Mrs. Harriet Lee Bracken, in 1882. He was appointed\r\nregister of the land office at St. Croix Falls by President Lincoln in\r\n1861, and served twenty-six years. Though over eighty years of age he\r\nretains his faculties and general health, and his mind is a store\r\nhouse of the early history of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nALDEN.\r\n\r\nThe town of Alden embraces township 32, range 17, and twenty-four\r\nsections of range 18. It has both prairie and timber land, and is\r\nabundantly supplied with water. Apple river traverses it from\r\nnortheast to southwest. There are many tributary small streams, and a\r\nlarge number of small lakes, of which Cedar lake is the largest. This\r\nlies only partially in Alden. The surface is gently undulating.\r\n\r\nThe town of Alden was organized in 1857. The first board of\r\nsupervisors were Stephen Williams, William Folsom and H. Sawyer. The\r\nfirst post office was established at Wagon Landing in 1862, V. M.\r\nBabcock, postmaster. The first settlers were Wm. Folsom, V. M.\r\nBabcock, V. B. Kittel, I. L. Bridgman, Charles Vassau, Jr., and\r\nHumphrey Sawyer, in 1856. Mr. Bridgman raised the first crops in 1857.\r\nThe first marriage was C. Vassau to Alma Kittel, in 1858, by Rev. A.\r\nBurton Peabody. The first white child born in Alden was P. B. Peabody,\r\nJuly 28, 1856. The first death was that of a child, Nicholas W.\r\nGordon, June 10, 1857. Alden has two post towns, Little Falls and\r\nAlden.\r\n\r\nREV. A. BURTON PEABODY was born May 22, 1823, in Andover, Windsor\r\ncounty, Vermont. He was the youngest of four minor children, and was\r\nleft fatherless at eight years of age, and motherless at fifteen. He\r\nobtained a good English education in the common schools, and at\r\nChester and Black River academies. The winter terms he spent in\r\nteaching. In 1844 he came to Janesville, Wisconsin, where he spent two\r\nyears, partly on a farm and partly in a law office, as a student and\r\nclerk. In 1847 he went to Iowa county, and taught school through the\r\nwinter at Mineral Point. The next year he went to Clarence, Green\r\ncounty, Wisconsin, where he spent four years in teaching. In 1852 he\r\nentered the Nashotah Theological Seminary, where he completed the\r\ncourse, and was ordained deacon in the Protestant Episcopal church,\r\nJune 3, 1855, by the Rev. Bishop Kemper, and took temporary charge of\r\nGrace church, Sheboygan. He was married to Charity Esther Kittel,\r\nSept. 22, 1855, at Clarence, by the Rev. Wm. Ruger. In November of the\r\nsame year he removed to Mississippi, spending the winter at Jackson.\r\nIn February he went to Middleton, Mississippi, to take charge of a\r\nmission work, including several appointments. He came, the June\r\nfollowing, to Polk county, Wisconsin, and spent the summer at Wagon\r\nLanding, on Apple river, where his wife's friends had made a\r\nsettlement, but in the winter returned to his mission work in the\r\nSouth, and there remained until 1857. Owing to the troubled political\r\ncondition of the South, he did not deem it advisable to remove his\r\nfamily thither, and so returned to Wagon Landing and obtained mission\r\nwork, visiting at intervals Foster's Mills, now New Richmond,\r\nHuntington, Cedar Valley, and St. Croix Falls. The intervening country\r\nwas, much of it, an unbroken wilderness, and he was obliged to make\r\nhis journeys not infrequently on foot, to cross the swollen streams\r\nand dare all the perils of the winter storm. In 1859 Mr. Peabody\r\naccepted a call to the rectorship of St. Paul's church, Plymouth,\r\nSheboygan county, but in 1862 returned to the valley of the St. Croix,\r\nand settled on a farm, undertaking meanwhile ministerial work at\r\nPrescott and other points, in a line extending as far north as St.\r\nCroix Falls. Three years later Prescott and River Falls were made\r\nindependent, another man taking charge. In 1879 Mr. Peabody undertook\r\nadditional work on the North Wisconsin railroad, including a large\r\nnumber of places, to be visited monthly. In 1882 his railroad work was\r\nlimited to Clayton, Cumberland and Hayward. He still has charge, as\r\nrector, of Star Prairie and Wagon Landing. Few men have led more\r\nlaborious lives or been more useful in their calling. He has witnessed\r\nthe erection of eight churches on the field in which he labored,\r\nthough concerned directly in the building of only four. Mr. Peabody's\r\nfamily consists of seven sons and seven daughters. One of the latter\r\ndied in infancy.\r\n\r\nV. M. BABCOCK settled at Wagon Landing, town of Alden, in 1856. He was\r\nborn in Rensselaer county, New York; married his first wife in New\r\nYork and his second wife at Somerset, St. Croix county, Wisconsin.\r\nThey have four children. He has held town offices ever since the\r\norganization of the town. He has been sheriff, and was county\r\nsuperintendent of schools for seven years.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPLE RIVER.\r\n\r\nThe town of Apple River includes township 34, range 16, and derives\r\nits name from its principal river. The town is well watered by Apple\r\nriver and its tributaries, and it also has numerous lakes, the most\r\nconsiderable of which is White Ash lake. The surface of the town is\r\ngently undulating, and was originally covered with pine, interspersed\r\nwith hardwood groves. There is good wheat soil, and natural meadows\r\nare found in some parts. The town was organized Jan. 22, 1876, having\r\nbeen set off from Balsam Lake. There are two post offices, Apple River\r\non the west, and Shiloh on the east town line.\r\n\r\n\r\nBALSAM LAKE.\r\n\r\nThe town of Balsam Lake embraces township 34, range 17, and takes its\r\nname from a lake within its bounds. It has an undulating surface,\r\ncovered with heavy oak, pine, and maple timber principally. Balsam\r\ncreek, the outlet of Balsam lake, flows through it in a southerly\r\ndirection, affording fine water powers. About one-sixth of the surface\r\nis covered with lakes. The largest of these, Balsam lake, in the\r\nIndian language An-in-on-duc-a-gon, or evergreen place, gives name to\r\nthe town. Deer, Long, Wild Goose, and Mud lakes are fine bodies of\r\nwater with bold, timbered shores, and abundance of fish. The town is\r\nnear the geographical centre of the county. The first white man, prior\r\nto the organization of the town, to locate within its present bounds\r\nwas a disreputable trader named Miller, who in 1848 built a shanty on\r\nBalsam lake, from which he dispensed whisky to the Indians. This man\r\nwas not long afterward driven out of the country. (See history of St.\r\nCroix Falls.) The town was organized in 1869. The first board of\r\nsupervisors consisted of Geo. P. Anderson, Wright Haskins, and Joseph\r\nLoveless. The clerk was H. J. Fall; the treasurer, F. R. Loveless. The\r\nfirst school was taught by Jane Husband. Aaron M. Chase built a\r\nshingle mill at the outlet of Balsam lake in 1850, and he seems to\r\nhave been the first actual settler or the first man to make\r\nimprovements. As he had neither oxen nor horses, the timbers for the\r\nmill were hauled by man power with the aid of yokes and ropes. Other\r\npersons came to the mill and lived there awhile, but the first\r\npermanent settlers came in in 1856. They were J. Shepherd, Joseph\r\nLoveless, Joseph Ravett, and John M. Rogers. Mr. Rogers raised the\r\nfirst crops in the town; Joseph Ravett was the first postmaster. The\r\nfirst marriage was that of J. K. Adams to Miss L. A. Millerman, by W.\r\nH. Skinner. The first white child born was a daughter to R. S.\r\nHaskins. The first death, that of a child, occurred in 1870. A first\r\nclass flouring mill has been erected at the outlet of Balsam lake. It\r\nis owned by Herman Corning; a saw mill is also in operation at this\r\npoint. A Methodist church, 30 × 40 feet ground plan, was erected at\r\nBalsam Lake by the Methodist society in 1886.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEAVER.\r\n\r\nThe town of Beaver includes township 34, range 15. It was set off from\r\nApple River and organized Nov. 15, 1885. The name was suggested as\r\nbeing appropriate from the work of the beaver in past ages. Beaver\r\ndams are numerous on all the creeks. These ancient works will mostly\r\ndisappear with the progress of agriculture. The town is drained by\r\nstreams flowing into Apple river. Horseshoe lake, in the northeast\r\ncorner, is three miles in length.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK BROOK.\r\n\r\nThe town of Black Brook includes township 32, range 16. Apple river,\r\nwith its tributaries, supplies it with abundant water privileges.\r\nBlack Brook, the principal tributary, gives the town its name, and\r\ndrains the southern portion. There are many small lakes. The surface\r\nis undulating and most of the soil good. The post office of Black\r\nBrook is in section 32. The North Wisconsin railroad passes through\r\nsections 25, 35 and 36. This town was originally a part of Alden, but\r\nwas organized and set off as a new town Aug. 5, 1867. J. C. Nelson\r\nand G. H. Goodrich were the first supervisors. The first settlers\r\n(1863) were John Gorsuch, John Reed and Jacob Polwer; the first\r\npostmaster was ---- Gates; the first school teacher, Tina\r\nStarkweather; the first marriage that of S. D. Starkweather and Mary\r\nDanforth; the first death that of Mrs. Ben Gilman.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLAM FALLS.\r\n\r\nClam Falls comprises township 37, range 16, and derives its name from\r\nthe falls on Clam river. The surface is rolling and timbered with\r\nhardwood and pine. It is well watered by South Clam creek and its\r\ntributaries. Somers' lake, in section 27, is the only lake. An\r\nupheaval of trap rock on Clam creek has caused the waterfall from\r\nwhich the town has taken its name. It is a fine water power. A dam for\r\ncollecting tolls on saw logs has been placed just above the Falls.\r\nGood specimens of copper ore are found in the trap. The town was set\r\noff from Luck and organized Nov. 15, 1876. The first town meeting was\r\nheld April, 1877. The first supervisors were Daniel F. Smith, John\r\nAlmquist and John Bjornson. D. F. Smith was the first settler, built\r\nthe first saw mill, and raised the first crops.\r\n\r\nDaniel F. Smith, a peculiar and eccentric man, was born in Chautauqua\r\ncounty, New York, in 1813; emigrated to Michigan in 1834, where he\r\nmarried Eliza Green the following year, and moved to Racine county,\r\nWisconsin. In 1842 he engaged in lumbering on the Wisconsin river, his\r\nhome being at Stevens Point. He was of the firms of Smith & Bloomer\r\nand Smith & Fellows. Mr. Bloomer was accidentally killed, on which\r\naccount the business of these firms was closed, Mr. Smith removing to\r\nGalena to facilitate the settlement of their affairs. In 1852 he\r\nremoved to St. Louis; in 1853 to Memphis, Tennessee, where he engaged\r\nin the wholesale grocery business, losing heavily, in fact all the\r\naccumulations of his life. In the spring of 1855 he leased the St.\r\nCroix Falls saw mill, and operated it for two years, when trouble\r\narose and litigation ensued, in which Smith obtained a judgment\r\nagainst Cushing for $1,000. In 1860 he removed to Clinton, Iowa, and\r\nthence in the same year to California. He traveled much, visiting\r\nmines. He spent some time in mining, and also manufactured shingles.\r\nIn 1862 he returned to St. Croix Falls and engaged in lumbering for\r\nthree years. In 1868 he built a saw mill at Butternut Lake,\r\nWisconsin. He did much to open that country to settlement. He was the\r\nfounder of a town which he called \"Luck.\" In 1872 he was the first\r\nsettler at Clam Falls, where he built a saw mill with but one man to\r\nassist, and around that mill has sprung up a flourishing settlement.\r\nDan Smith, with undaunted perseverance, has battled his way through\r\nlife, and has come out victorious over difficulties and opposition\r\nthat would have discouraged and turned back other men. Mr. Smith is a\r\nplain, direct, outspoken man; a man of energy and ability. He has ably\r\nand satisfactorily filled many places of trust. For many years he has\r\nbeen a commissioner of Polk county.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLAYTON.\r\n\r\nClayton includes township 33, range 15. The town was set off from\r\nBlack Brook. The surface of a great part of the town is level and was\r\noriginally marshy, but these marshes have been gradually drained, and\r\nfine farms and hay meadows have taken their place. The town was\r\norganized Nov. 10, 1875. The first supervisors were Morris De'Golier,\r\nWorthy Prentice and H. D. West. The first homestead entries were made\r\nin 1865 by Peter Bouchea and John McKay, a Frenchman, both Indian\r\ntraders, who established a post at Marsh lake, but in six months\r\nabandoned it and never returned. The next settlers were Vandyke,\r\nMorehouse and Tanner, near the west line of the town, about 1870. The\r\nfirst improvements were made by Elam Greely in 1862, who dug a canal\r\ninto Marsh lake to get water to float logs out of Beaver brook,\r\nthereby draining great tracts of swamp land. The laying of the North\r\nWisconsin railroad track gave a fresh impetus to business, and\r\nconduced greatly to the building of the village of Clayton in section\r\n24. The first sermon in the town of Clayton was preached by Rev. W. W.\r\nAmes, a Baptist; the first school was taught by S. M. De'Golier; the\r\nfirst store was opened by A. M. Wilcox, 1874. D. A. Humbird was the\r\nfirst postmaster. The North Wisconsin railway passes through the\r\nsoutheast part and the Minneapolis, Soo & Atlantic passes from the\r\nwest side to the northeast corner of the town, and has a station,\r\nGregory, in the west part.\r\n\r\nREUBEN F. LITTLE was born June 13, 1839, in Topsham, Devonshire\r\ncounty, England. At ten years of age he began to care for himself,\r\nworking for sixpence per week, carrying pottery in a moulding house.\r\nBefore leaving England his wages had increased to three shillings per\r\nweek. In the spring of 1853 he had saved three pounds sterling, and\r\nhis grandfather gave him two pounds sterling. This five pounds paid\r\nhis passage to Quebec and Montreal, where he got four dollars per\r\nmonth. Soon after he apprenticed himself for five years to learn the\r\nbaker's and confectioner's trade at London, Upper Canada. Subsequently\r\nhe took a homestead from the British government at Trading Lake, Upper\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REUBEN F. LITTLE.]\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1861, at Detroit, Michigan, he enlisted in the United\r\nStates infantry, regular army, and was promoted successively to first\r\nsergeant, to sergeant major, to second lieutenant, to first\r\nlieutenant. He resigned in September, 1865. During the war he served\r\ncontinuously in Gen. George H. Thomas' division, and took part in all\r\nthe engagements under him, from Miles Springs, Kentucky, to Nashville,\r\nTennessee. On the twenty-second of September, 1863, Mr. Little had the\r\nhonor of being the last man to leave the Rossville Gap in front of\r\nChattanooga after the disastrous fight of Chickamauga. He was wounded\r\nin the battle of Hoover's Gap and Smyrna, and at the siege of Corinth.\r\n\r\nMr. Little was married in 1865, and divorced in 1869, and re-married\r\nin St. Paul in 1878. He lost his Canada homestead, and took another\r\nhomestead in Lincoln, Polk county, Wisconsin, in 1866. Afterward he\r\nwent to St. Paul and became one of the firm of Little & Berrisford in\r\nthe wholesale confectionery business. In 1879 he returned to Clayton,\r\nformerly part of Lincoln, and reclaimed a swamp of over six hundred\r\nacres, making it a productive meadow and tillage farm. Mr. Little has\r\nserved several years as Clayton's town supervisor.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLEAR LAKE.\r\n\r\nClear Lake embraces township 32, range 15. It derives its name from a\r\nbeautiful clear lake on the western boundary near Clear Lake village.\r\nThe west part of the town is timbered principally with hardwood, and\r\nis good farming land. The eastern part is more diversified, and there\r\nare some large groves of pine. Willow river runs through the town. The\r\nNorth Wisconsin railroad traverses the town diagonally from northeast\r\nto southwest: The town was organized June 20, 1877; S. D. Mann, J. C.\r\nGates, and W. R. Ingalls, supervisors. The first settlers were John\r\nHale, L. P. Nash, S. D. Starkweather, and Perry Clark. Lawrence\r\nO'Connor was first postmaster; Mr. Starkweather carried the mail on\r\nfoot. Israel Graves, in 1875, built the first saw mill in Clear Lake\r\nvillage and the first house. There is now at the village a stave mill\r\nowned by Symme & Co. Jewett Bros. own a saw mill on Willow river,\r\nthree miles from the village, which has a capacity of 8,000,000 feet.\r\nThe lumber is delivered to the railway at the village by a wooden\r\ntramway. The lots for the village were purchased from the government\r\nby A. Boody and A. Coventry, in 1856. The plat was made by Symme,\r\nGlover & Co. The survey was made by G. W. Cooley. Thomas T. McGee was\r\nthe first settler (1875), and Stephen H. Whitcomb the second. The\r\nfirst school house was built in 1875, and the first school was taught\r\nby Clara Davis in the same year. The village has now a good graded\r\nschool with three departments, Charles Irle, principal. Its two church\r\nbuildings, Congregational and Methodist, were destroyed by the cyclone\r\nof 1884, but are being rebuilt. The Swedish Lutherans have a church a\r\nmile from the village. Chas. Decker was the first postmaster; A. Symme\r\n& Co. were the first merchants; P. Gates, M.D., the first practicing\r\nphysician; F. M. Nye the first lawyer. The first marriage was that of\r\nJohn C. Gates and Ella Scovill. The first birth was Chas. W. Whitcomb,\r\nand the first death that of a child of Hans Johnson.\r\n\r\n\r\nPINEVILLE.\r\n\r\nThe town of Pineville, a railroad station and village in section 9, is\r\na lumbering centre. The Pineville Lumbering Company have here a saw\r\nmill with a capacity of 7,000,000 feet. The logs are brought on wooden\r\nrailways three to ten miles. P. B. Lacy & Co., of Hudson, are the\r\nproprietors.\r\n\r\nFRANK M. NYE was born in Shirley, Piscataquis county, Maine, in 1852.\r\nHis parents removed to Wisconsin in 1854. He was educated at the\r\ncommon schools and at River Falls Academy. He came to Clear Lake in\r\n1879, and was elected district attorney for Polk county in 1880, and\r\nrepresentative in the Wisconsin assembly in 1885. He removed to\r\nMinneapolis in 1887.\r\n\r\n\r\nEUREKA.\r\n\r\nEureka embraces township 35, range 18 and a fractional part of range\r\n19. The west part is somewhat broken by the St. Croix bluffs; the\r\nremainder is undulating and capable of agricultural improvement. There\r\nare many good farms in this town. There are a few small lakes in the\r\neastern part. Eureka was set off from St. Croix Falls, and organized\r\nDec. 16, 1877. The first supervisors were Lucius A. Harper, Jens\r\nWelling and William Booth. The first settlers were L. A. Harper, John\r\nC. Beede, Henry Cole and others. There are three post offices in the\r\ntown,--Harper, Cushing and North Valley. At the mouth of Wolf creek,\r\nin the extreme northwestern section of this town, J. R. Brown had a\r\ntrading house in the '30s, and Louis Roberts in the '40s. At this\r\nplace Alex. Livingston, another trader, was killed by Indians in 1849.\r\nLivingston had built him a comfortable home, which he made a stopping\r\nplace for the weary traveler, whom he fed on wild rice, maple sugar,\r\nvenison, bear meat, muskrats, wild fowl and flour bread, all decently\r\nprepared by his Indian wife. Mr. Livingston was killed by an Indian in\r\n1849.\r\n\r\nIn 1855 Carma P. Garlick surveyed a quarter section here and laid it\r\noff into town lots, and had lithograph maps published, calling the\r\nprospective village Sebatanna, an Indian town signifying \"Water\r\nVillage.\"\r\n\r\nCHARLES NEVERS settled here about 1860, and has now a fine farm and\r\ngood buildings.\r\n\r\n\r\nFARMINGTON.\r\n\r\nFarmington was organized as a town in 1858. It contains forty-two\r\nsections of land, in township 32, ranges 18 and 19, with some\r\nfractions of sections on the St. Croix. It is a rich agricultural\r\ntown, well diversified with prairie and timber land. Its western\r\nportion, along the St. Croix, has the picturesque bluffs common to\r\nthat river, with some unusually beautiful cascades and hillside\r\nsprings, of which the most notable are the well known mineral spring\r\nand the springs at the lime kiln. The mineral spring is situated on\r\nthe St. Croix river, at the base of the bluff, and about one mile and\r\na half below Osceola Mills. A beautiful hotel was built in 1876 on the\r\ncliff above, at a cost of about $20,000, which became quite a popular\r\nplace of resort until 1885, when it was burned. It has not been\r\nrebuilt. The property was improved by Currant & Stevens, but afterward\r\nsold.\r\n\r\nThe following analysis shows the chemical constituents of a gallon of\r\nthe water of the spring:\r\n\r\n                                GRAINS.\r\n    Chloride of sodium             .053\r\n    Sulphate of soda               .524\r\n    Bicarbonate of soda            .799\r\n    Bicarbonate of lime          11.193\r\n    Bicarbonate of magnesia       7.248\r\n    Iron and alumina               .492\r\n    Silica                         .265\r\n    Organic matter              a trace\r\n                                -------\r\n    Total                        20,565\r\n\r\nSouth Farmington Corners has a prosperous cheese factory, owned and\r\noperated by Koch Brothers, erected in 1883, turning out in 1884\r\nsixteen tons of cheese and in 1885 over twenty tons. South Farmington\r\nhas a Catholic church building.\r\n\r\nThe first crops in Farmington were raised by Wm. Kent on a farm near\r\nOsceola in 1846, and the same year Harmon Crandall and Richard Arnold\r\nimproved land and raised crops not far from the present village of\r\nFarmington. Here, owing to the sandy nature of the soil, well digging\r\nproved rather perilous to the two farmers. Mr. Arnold attempted to dig\r\na well in a depression, a sinkhole, in the prairie. As he dug deeper\r\nthe sides of the well caved in, almost burying him. He managed by his\r\nown utmost exertions and those of his friend Crandall to escape, but\r\nleft his boots deeply imbedded in prairie soil.\r\n\r\nIn 1887 the Soo Railroad Company bridged the St. Croix, at the cedar\r\nbend at the south point of the leaning cedars, and extended their\r\ngrade along the base of the precipice overlooking the river above, and\r\ncommanding an extensive view of bold, picturesque and beautiful\r\nscenery.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIOGRAPHICAL.\r\n\r\nHARMON CRANDALL.--The Crandall family were the first to settle in\r\nOsceola Prairie, in the town of Farmington. Mr. Crandall moved to his\r\nfarm in 1846, and lived there many years; sold out and removed to\r\nHudson, where, in later life, he became blind. He had three sons born\r\nin Farmington. In 1882 he moved to Shell Lake, Washburn county, where\r\nhe died, Aug. 8, 1886. Mrs. Crandall died May 11, 1888.\r\n\r\nSAMUEL WALL.--Mr. Wall was born in 1824, in Shropshire, England; went\r\nas a British soldier to the West Indies in 1840; two years later came\r\nto New York City; one year later to St. Louis; in 1844 to St. Paul and\r\nin 1846 to the St. Croix valley, where he made a permanent home at the\r\nlime kiln, which he bought of William Willim. He was married to Anna\r\nMaria Moore in 1857. They had been educated as Episcopalians, but are\r\nnow Catholics and have educated their children in that faith in the\r\nschools at St. Paul. Mr. Wall served five years in the British army\r\nfor thirteen pence a day, but West India rum was cheap, only ten pence\r\nper gallon, and this, Mr. Wall pathetically remarked, \"was an\r\nunfortunate element for the lime-kiln man.\" After twenty-six years of\r\nstruggle Mr. Wall came out victorious and now strongly advises all\r\nyoung men to \"touch not, taste not, handle not,\" anything that can\r\nintoxicate. The writer trusts he may stand firm.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM RAMSEY was born in Ireland in 1814, and came to America with\r\nhis parents in his youth, first settling in Nova Scotia. In 1834 he\r\ncame to Washington county, Maine. In 1839 he was married to Sarah\r\nStevens, at Crawford, Maine. In 1849 he went to California.

It is well watered and has many small lakes,\r\nwhile Sucker lake, a lake of considerable size, is about equally\r\ndivided between its own territory and that of Lincoln. Garfield was\r\norganized in 1886. The first supervisors were Abraham Sylvester, James\r\nT. Montgomery and Martin Hanson. In 1887 the Minneapolis, Soo &\r\nAtlantic railway built through the town from west to southeast and\r\nestablished one station, Deronda, in the southeast corner of the town.\r\nThe post office of El Salem is in Garfield.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGETOWN.\r\n\r\nGeorgetown comprises township 35, ranges 15 and 16. This town is\r\nabundantly supplied with water by Apple river and its tributaries, and\r\nnumerous lakes, some of them of considerable size. The largest are\r\nBone, Blake, Powder and Pipe. The timber is hardwood and pine\r\nintermingled. Immense quantities of pine have been taken from this\r\ntown, and still much remains. Wild meadows are plentiful. Georgetown\r\nwas set off from Milltown and organized Nov. 15, 1879. The first\r\nsupervisors were David H. Smith, Elisha E. Drake and August Larbell.\r\nGeorge P. Anderson was the first settler (1873), and his christian\r\nname was affixed to the town. The first school was taught in 1874 by\r\nJohn Burns. A post office was established in 1881 at Bunyan, G.

The first death was\r\nthat of August Larbell.\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO MEN MURDERED.\r\n\r\nOliver Grover and Harry Knight, two prominent lumbermen of Stillwater,\r\non July 2, 1864, were exploring for timber and hay on Pipe lake,\r\nsection 10, in Georgetown. Not returning to their camp, two miles\r\ndistant, the watchman at the camp, after waiting two days, went to St.\r\nCroix Falls and gave the alarm. Many parties went in pursuit of the\r\nlost men. Some traces of their presence were discovered on the shore\r\nof this lake, but the search was finally abandoned. After some months\r\nthe Indians confessed that two of their young men shot the two men,\r\ndisemboweled them, burned the entrails and sunk the bodies in the\r\nlake. Their bodies were never found. We append the following newspaper\r\nclipping:\r\n\r\n\"FINALE.--The friends of the two Indians that shot Grover and Knight,\r\nlast Tuesday delivered to P. B. Lacy, of St. Croix Falls, the\r\nvaluables that were taken from the bodies of the murdered men. They\r\nconsisted of $113 in gold, $282.05 in greenbacks, $160 in silver, one\r\nsilver watch, one wallet and one pocket knife. This is probably the\r\nclosing act of the bloody tragedy which cost two innocent men their\r\nlives at the hands of Indians steeped in liquor, and who, fearing the\r\nvengeance of the white man, committed suicide.\"\r\n\r\nThe two murderers had confessed the crime and shot themselves.\r\n\r\nGEORGE P. ANDERSON.--Mr. Anderson was born in Fulvana county,\r\nVirginia, 1825; was educated in the common schools; lived in Ohio\r\neighteen and in Indiana fifteen years, and came to Balsam Lake in\r\n1866. Few men have been more active in the opening up of a new\r\nsettlement. Mr. Anderson has been several times elected to office in\r\nthe new county, and was a principal actor in the establishment of the\r\nPolk County Agricultural Society in 1886. He has a family of fifteen\r\nchildren living.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAKETOWN.\r\n\r\nLaketown includes township 36, range 18. It is named from the lakes\r\nthat dot almost every section in the town. Trade lake, with its\r\ntributary from Butternut lake, are the principal streams. The town was\r\nset off from Sterling and organized April 6, 1875. The first\r\nsupervisors were L. Bell; S. P. Heard and N. Fornell. The town was\r\nsettled largely by Swedes, Norwegians, Danes and Alabamians. The\r\nlatter settled in the northwestern part of the town. In 1869 Caleb\r\nCushing bought the agricultural college lands in the town to the\r\namount of 7,200 acres. The first school house was built in 1870, in\r\nsection 8. P. Tierney taught the first school. Lindsey McKee was the\r\nfirst settler. He was also the first to sell out and leave. Daniel\r\nSwensbarger, a German, bought him out, and a number of his countrymen\r\nsettled near him. Jacob Swensbarger started a store. N. Grondund built\r\nthe first blacksmith shop. Peter Olsen built the first saw mill, at\r\nthe foot of Long lake, in 1875. The first marriage was that of L.\r\nMcKee and Mary Addington, by L. Bell, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN.\r\n\r\nLincoln includes township 33, range 16, and the eastern tier of\r\nsections of township 33, range 17. It is abundantly watered by Apple\r\nriver and its tributaries, and has numerous lakes of which Sucker\r\nlake is the largest. The soil is well adapted to the culture of wheat.\r\nThere are many fine farms in this township. The surface, originally\r\ncovered with timber, is undulating. The town was organized in 1860,\r\nbeing set off from Osceola. The first town meeting was held April,\r\n1861. A. A. Heald, M. C. Lane and John Hurness were the first\r\nsupervisors. The post town is at Lincoln Centre. The Polk county poor\r\nfarm is pleasantly situated on a lake in Lincoln, and has been well\r\nmanaged for a series of years by Capt. Wilkie.\r\n\r\nAMERY village is located on Apple river, at the crossing of the \"Soo\r\nLine\" railway. It has two saw mills and a stave factory. The\r\nMinneapolis, Soo & Atlantic railway passes through Lincoln from\r\nsouthwest to east, and has a station at Apple River crossing, named\r\nAmery, in honor of William Amery, one of Polk county's best citizens.\r\n\r\nWM.

L.\r\nEllis.\r\n\r\nThe first settler was C. Loraine Ruggles. He was somewhat eccentric.\r\nHe published a book embodying his own adventures during the Rebellion,\r\nwhich he called \"The Great American Spy.\" The town was named after\r\nhim. N. B. Bull and Chas. Anderson were the next settlers.\r\n\r\nWM. WALLACE GALLESPIE was born in Louisville, Kentucky; lived in his\r\nyouth in Illinois and came to Marine Mills in 1844. In 1851 he married\r\nCecilia M. Ring, widow of Charles Turner, of Taylor's Falls. In 1878\r\nhe moved to his homestead in Loraine, where he has a good farm and\r\nhotel. He has two sons and one daughter.\r\n\r\n\r\nLUCK.\r\n\r\nLuck includes township 36, ranges 16 and 17. It is a good agricultural\r\nregion and contains already many valuable farms. The eastern half of\r\nthe town was originally a rich pine wood region. Much of the timber is\r\nyet standing. The town is well watered by Upper Trade and Straight\r\nrivers and has many beautiful lakes, the principal of which are\r\nButternut and North. Luck was organized as a town Nov. 9, 1869. The\r\nfirst supervisors were Wm. H. Foster, M. C. Pederson and J. J. Bille.\r\nThe first settlers were Wm. W. Gallespie, W. H. Foster and D. F. Smith\r\n(1857). The first marriage was that of W. H. Foster, and his oldest\r\nchild was the first white child born in Luck. Wm. Gallespie raised the\r\nfirst crops. D. F. Smith built the first saw mill. W. H. Foster was\r\nfirst postmaster. At present there are two post offices, one at the\r\nvillage of Luck, the other at West Denmark. Laura Jones taught the\r\nfirst school in Luck. The town has been settled chiefly by Danes,\r\nmostly direct from Denmark. A Danish high school was established in\r\n1884, K. Noregaad, principal, at which different languages are taught.\r\nThe building cost $3,000. It is beautifully located on Butternut lake.\r\nThe Lutherans have three flourishing church organizations in this\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM H.

His native\r\nplace was New Hampshire.\r\n\r\n\r\nMILLTOWN.\r\n\r\nMilltown includes township 35, range 17. It is a good agricultural and\r\nstock growing town. It is watered by the small streams flowing into\r\nBalsam, Half Moon and other lakes. The timber is mostly hardwood.\r\nThere is pine in the eastern part. The Patterson post office is\r\nlocated in section 7, Milltown in section 36. Milltown was set off\r\nfrom St. Croix Falls Dec. 20, 1869. The first town meeting was held\r\nJan. 8, 1870. The first supervisors were John Lynch, M. Fitzgerald,\r\nSr., and John Hurley. The Roman Catholic church was organized here in\r\n1864. Their new house of worship was built in 1870. The first settlers\r\nwere James and John Rogers. The first school (1865) was taught by\r\nMaggie Crawford. The first school house was built in 1866. A grange\r\nwas organized in 1884. The town has now a good brick school house and\r\na saw and flour mill.\r\n\r\nPATRICK LILLIS was born in Ireland in 1807. He came to Polk county in\r\n1856, and, with his amiable wife and enterprising sons, made a claim\r\non what was afterward styled Milltown, an inappropriate name, but\r\ngiven by Mr. Lillis himself, as he humorously remarked, \"because there\r\nwas not a stream large enough for a mill site in the town,\" and\r\nMilltown it remains to this day. Mr. Lillis prospered and made himself\r\na good home. He died Feb. 26, 1886. Mrs. Lillis died December, 1885.\r\nThey left six sons. John C. is in Greene county, Texas, Simon C. is in\r\nSouthern California, and Richard is in Memphis, Tennessee. Henry, the\r\nyoungest, aged twenty-nine years, has for the past six years been a\r\nresident of Tacoma, Washington Territory. The residence of Martin and\r\nJames is not known.\r\n\r\n\r\nOSCEOLA.\r\n\r\nOsceola contains all of township 33, range 18, except the eastern tier\r\nof sections, and ten whole sections and some fractions of range 19,\r\nmade somewhat irregular by the St. Croix river boundary, and the\r\nobtrusion of three sections of Farmington in the southwestern part. It\r\nis a rich agricultural town, consisting chiefly of prairie, the whole\r\nforming a tableland, terminating westward on the precipitous bluffs of\r\nthe St. Croix. It has a good steamboat landing and two good water\r\npowers, Osceola and Close's creeks. These are both fine trout brooks.\r\nThe bluffs overlooking the St. Croix are bold and high, and, for a\r\ngreat part, precipitous. Most conspicuous of these bluffs is the\r\npromontory known as Eagle Point, situated just below the Osceola\r\nlanding. An escarpment of limestone, about two hundred feet above the\r\nriver, projects over its base, not much unlike the celebrated table\r\nrock at Niagara Falls. A tall and solitary pine tree stands upon the\r\nextreme verge of this rock, the whole forming a conspicuous landmark,\r\nvisible to a distance of several miles down the river. The cascade on\r\nOsceola creek, a few rods above its mouth, has scarcely a rival\r\namongst the waterfalls of the West. It has sometimes been called the\r\nMinnehaha of Wisconsin, but while it resembles somewhat in the lower\r\npart of its descent that celebrated cascade, the scenery around it is\r\nmuch wilder, perpendicular rocks towering over it to a great height,\r\nwhile the upper part of the fall is over an inclined plain, broken\r\ninto steps. It is a favorite haunt for artists and photographers.\r\nThere are several minor waterfalls of great beauty in the vicinity.\r\nThe trap rock formation crops out in the eastern and northern parts of\r\nthe town, rich in specimens of copper and silver. Silver is also found\r\nin ledges at East Lake.\r\n\r\nThe first land claim in the town, made May 14, 1844, by Milton V.\r\nNobles and Lucius N. S. Parker, included the cascade and the present\r\nsite of the village. The claim was made with the intention of building\r\na saw mill at the outlet of Osceola creek. The mill company, organized\r\nin 1841, consisted of M. V. and W. H. Nobles, Wm. Kent, Wm. O. Mahony\r\nand Harvey Walker. Mr. Nobles sold his interest and removed to Willow\r\nRiver; Wm. Parker removed to St. Anthony. The mill commenced cutting\r\ntimber in 1845. It was run at first with a small flutter wheel, which\r\nwas replaced by a an overshot wheel, 30 feet; that by another, 45\r\nfeet, and that by one 50 feet in diameter. In 1845 the company built a\r\ntwo story boarding house, also a shop and office, near the mill. After\r\nthe completion of the mill Walker withdrew from the firm and Anson\r\nNorthrup was for a short time a member. Kent & Mahony for a number of\r\nyears operated the mill, selling lumber in Galena and St. Louis.\r\nMahony left for California in 1852. Around this mill, as a nucleus,\r\nthe settlement of Osceola and the village were built up. The mill,\r\nwith its immense water wheel, for so many years a conspicuous object\r\non the river, has long since disappeared.\r\n\r\nOsceola has had many enterprising business men engaged in\r\nmerchandising and manufacturing. The first flouring mill was built by\r\nKent Brothers in 1853, just above the cascade. This mill changed\r\nowners several times, and was burned in 1880. It was rebuilt by\r\nLovejoy & Sutton in 1883. Its present capacity is one hundred barrels\r\nper day. The second flouring mill was built by Dresser & Wilson in\r\n1867. It is situated on the same stream, a few rods above the first.\r\nIt has also changed owners several times. Its capacity is fifty\r\nbarrels per day. The first merchants were Wyckoff and Stevenson, in\r\n1856. These have been succeeded by Rice, Webb, Clark Brothers,\r\nArmstrong & Co., Talboys & Staples, Dresser & Wilson, Lacy & Johnson,\r\nW. A. Talboys, Gridley & Co., Heald & Thing, Dresser Brothers, and\r\nothers. Dr. Gray was the first practicing physician. After him, at\r\ndifferent periods, came Drs. Hilton, Brooks, Gaskill, Garlick,\r\nMarshall, Searles, Cornbacker and Clark. The first deed recorded of\r\nOsceola property was a quitclaim from Wm. H. Nobles to Anson Northrup,\r\nconsideration $3,250, in 1847. The first lawyer settled here was I. P.\r\nFreeland. His successors were Button, Dowling, Dyke, McDill, and\r\nothers. The first sermon preached in Osceola was by Rev. Lemuel\r\nNobles, a Methodist minister, in 1851. There are two church\r\norganizations; each has respectable church buildings. The first\r\nBaptist preacher was Rev. S. T. Catlin, in 1854. The Baptists built\r\nthe first church in the county in Osceola, 1856. The first log house\r\nin the town was built by Richard Arnold in the locality of the famous\r\nDrake Troutmere springs. This house was built in 1848. Mr. Arnold\r\nraised the first crops in the town of Osceola. The first school house\r\nwas built in 1852. A high school building was erected in 1868. W. A.\r\nTalboys taught the first public school in 1852. Until 1861 the schools\r\nwere under the town system. In 1875 a free high school was\r\nestablished. The first post office was established in 1854, and W. C.\r\nGuild was postmaster for twenty years. The first town election was\r\nheld April 5, 1853, when the following supervisors were elected: Wm.\r\nRamsey, chairman; Nelson McCarty and W. C. Guild. At this meeting the\r\ntown voted a tax of thirty dollars for school and fifty dollars for\r\ntown expenses. The first Sunday-school was organized by W. A. Talboys\r\nin 1852.\r\n\r\nThe first marriage, that of John Buckley to Elizabeth Godfrey, was in\r\n1853. The first white child born was John Francis, in 1847. The first\r\ndeath was that of Leroy Hubble, by accident, in 1845.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHANGE OF NAME.\r\n\r\nThe name of the town was originally Leroy, in honor of Mr. Hubble\r\nabove mentioned. It is to be regretted that this name was not\r\nretained, inasmuch as Osceola, though the name of one of the most\r\ncelebrated Indians in American history, is shared by a post town in\r\nthe eastern part of the State. It was therefore necessary to call this\r\npost town Osceola Mills, a distinction that correspondents and\r\npostmasters are not always careful to note. Osceola village remained\r\nunorganized until Aug. 10, 1887. The first officers were: President,\r\nH. B. Dyke; trustees, W. C. Reilly, R. S. Sutton, G. W. De Long, H. E.\r\nCornbacker, Paul Filzen, S. C. Benjamin; clerk, S. Rowcliff;\r\ntreasurer, C. W. Staples; supervisor, G. D. McDill; justice of the\r\npeace, George Wilson; police justice, T. Post. The village has a\r\nsplendid situation upon the bluffs overlooking the river, and\r\ncommunicates with points on the river by boat, and with overland\r\npoints by the Minneapolis, Soo & Atlantic railway, completed to this\r\nplace Aug. 21, 1887. There is also a branch road from Dresser's\r\nstation to St. Croix Falls. The village was visited by destructive\r\nfires at various times. Most prominent of these was the burning of the\r\nFreeland Hotel in 1857, the Western Hotel in 1878, and the first\r\nflouring mill in 1880.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIOGRAPHICAL.\r\n\r\nDANIEL MEARS.--Mr. Mears was born in Lynn, Massachusetts, in 1819. His\r\nfirst wife, Emeline Mendon, died in 1850, leaving three sons, Charles,\r\nDavid, and Daniel. In 1852 he was married to Susan Thompson.

It was organized in 1854, but unfortunately no records of\r\nits organization can be obtained. The surface is agreeably diversified\r\nby hill and plain, and is supplied with many species of timber,\r\nincluding maple, elm, and several varieties of oak. The St. Croix\r\nriver forms its western boundary, and presents here some of its\r\nwildest and most beautiful scenery, including the trap rock ledges of\r\nthe Dalles.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. CROIX FALLS VILLAGE.\r\n\r\nThe buildings of the Falls company formed the nucleus of a village\r\nwhich took the name of the Falls. Its history has been given somewhat\r\nat length in the history of the settlement, and in \"Reminiscences.\" It\r\nis situated on the east bank of the river, between the upper and lower\r\nfalls. It contains one first class flouring mill, owned by James\r\nThompson, one wagon and plow factory, owned by Comer Brothers, one\r\nagricultural warehouse, two livery stables (Harvey & Co., and Lillis\r\n& Co.), two excellent hotels (J.

Fiske), one\r\nUnited States land office, one church building (Presbyterian), costing\r\nabout $2,500, one graded school building, costing $6,000, one town\r\nhall and several commodious stores and dwellings. The village was\r\nplatted in 1857, by Marion T. Chandler. The post office was\r\nestablished in 1844. Harvey Wilson was the first postmaster. The\r\nMinneapolis, Soo & Atlantic Railway Company have a branch road\r\nextending to this place from Dresser's station, a distance of three\r\nmiles. The village was incorporated Feb. 21, 1888, with the following\r\nboard of officers: President, J. H.

The company's hotel was burned May, 1880; loss, $3,000.\r\nFiske's hotel was burned Sept. 16, 1885; loss, $6,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEST SWEDEN.\r\n\r\nWest Sweden embraces township 37, range 17. This is almost exclusively\r\na hardwood timbered district, with some pine in the north. The soil is\r\nrich and well watered with Spirit creek and Upper Wood river. The\r\nsurface is undulating. The north part has numerous lakes and meadows.\r\nThere is an upheaval of trap rock in section 2 and copper specimens\r\nabound. The principal settlers are Swedes. The town was organized Nov.\r\n10, 1875. The first supervisors were N. C. Johnson, A. Larson and A.\r\nDolberg.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTERLING.\r\n\r\nThe town of Sterling is composed of township 36, ranges 19 and 20. The\r\neast part is heavy hardwood timber land, with rich soil suitable for\r\nwheat; the west portion is very sandy and covered with a few\r\nscattering oaks and black pines. The whole town is well supplied with\r\nhay meadows, which afford great advantages to the stock raiser. The\r\nfirst actual settlers were Samuel Deneen and William Trimmer, who came\r\nin the fall of 1855. The year following William Lowell, from\r\nStillwater, entered three hundred and twenty acres in sections 14 and\r\n15, range 19, and made extensive improvements. Daniel F. Smith took up\r\nthe same amount of land in section 9, same town and range, and made\r\nimprovements. The first white child born was the son of James Cragin,\r\nAugust, 1858. The first white couple married was John Berry and Emily\r\nStout, in 1859. The first death was that of Mrs. Dunlap, sister of\r\nWilliam Trimmer, in 1859.\r\n\r\nThe town was organized in 1855. The first town meeting was held at the\r\nresidence of William Lowell, and Samuel Deneen was the first chairman\r\nof the town. The town was called Moscow, which name was changed one\r\nyear after to that of Sterling. It was the largest town in the county\r\nthen. It was organized into two school districts, but District No. 1\r\nnot being able to build a good school house, an old log shanty was\r\nfixed up for school purposes, and in this Miss Fanny Trimmer taught\r\nthe first school. The first saw and grist mill was built by Dr.\r\nDeneen. Olaf Strandburg established the first blacksmith shop and with\r\nit a gun shop. In 1849 Charles F. Rowley built a \"stopping place,\" so\r\ncalled in those days, on the banks of Wolf creek, at the old crossing,\r\nhalf a mile west of Deneen's, and cultivated a few acres of land. This\r\nhouse was burned one night by a lot of teamsters in a drunken orgie.\r\n\r\nDR. SAMUEL DENEEN, the first white settler in Sterling, was born Dec.\r\n27, 1801, in Youngstown, Ohio. He was married in 1825 to Margaret\r\nConly. He studied medicine in Michigan, and came to Wisconsin in 1854,\r\nand to Sterling in 1855. Dr. Deneen practiced his profession, made him\r\na farm, built a saw and grist mill on Wolf creek, established a post\r\noffice and took an active part in the interests of the new settlement.\r\nHe and his wife still live on the homestead which they have held for\r\nthe past thirty years. Mrs. Deneen was born in 1800.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM W. TRIMMER came to Sterling in 1855 and made a home, building\r\nand occupying what was for many years known as \"Trimmer's Hotel.\" Mr.\r\nTrimmer died in St. Croix Falls in 1874.\r\n\r\nARNOLD DENSMORE was born in Nova Scotia, in 1822; was married to\r\nMatilda Wallace in 1845, and came to Sterling in 1867, where he died,\r\nJan. 20, 1886, much respected as a neighbor, citizen and Christian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nST. CROIX COUNTY.\r\n\r\n\r\nJan. 9, 1840, the Wisconsin legislature created a new county out of\r\nCrawford county, including territory west of the Chippewa river,\r\nextending northward to the British possessions, and named it St.\r\nCroix. By the same act, a day was designated for an election, at which\r\na county seat was to be chosen and county officers elected. \"Mouth of\r\nSt. Croix,\" now Prescott, and Caw-caw-baw-kang, now St. Croix Falls,\r\nwere designated as voting places. Two places only were voted for,\r\n\"Mouth of St. Croix,\" and Dakotah, Brown's claim, now Schulenberg's\r\naddition to Stillwater. Dakotah was chosen by a vote of forty-five to\r\nthirteen. The returns were made to Prairie du Chien, county seat of\r\nCrawford county, and certificates issued to the county officers\r\nelected by C. J. Leonard, clerk of Crawford county. The legislature\r\nhad at the time of creating the new county made it a probate district,\r\nPhilip Aldrich being appointed judge.\r\n\r\nThe history of the county until 1848 has been given elsewhere, as\r\nconnected with the early history of Stillwater.\r\n\r\nThe admission of Wisconsin Territory as a state in 1848 divided the\r\ncounty, giving it the St. Croix river and state line as its western\r\nboundary. The Wisconsin portion of the old county was consequently\r\nleft without a county seat, while the portion west of the St. Croix\r\nhad a county seat, but was without state or territorial jurisdiction.\r\nCongress, however, declared Wisconsin territorial laws to be still in\r\nforce in the excluded territory, and they so remained until the\r\norganization of Minnesota Territory. Soon after the admission of\r\nWisconsin, that part of St. Croix county within its limits was\r\nreorganized for county and judicial purposes, and a new county seat\r\nchosen, located in section 24, township 29, range 19, at the mouth of\r\nWillow river. This county seat was at first called Buena Vista. On\r\nSept. 9, 1848, the county commissioners, under the law creating the\r\ncounty, held their first meeting at the county seat, in the house of\r\nPhilip Aldrich. The commissioners present were Ammah Andrews,\r\nchairman; W. H. Morse, and W. R. Anderson, clerk. Philip Aldrich was\r\nappointed treasurer. Four voting precincts were established, Mouth of\r\nSt. Croix, Willow River or Buena Vista, Osceola, and Falls of St.\r\nCroix. These early commissioners performed duties of the most varied\r\ncharacter incident to the government of a new county. There was as yet\r\nno county seal, and they were required to draw with the pen upon legal\r\ndocuments a scroll representing a seal, and to use other forms,\r\nappliances and devices without legal precedent.\r\n\r\nAt the second meeting of the county commissioners Osceola was\r\nrepresented by Harmon Crandall, he having been absent at the first\r\nmeeting of the board. Moses Perin was appointed collector. License for\r\nselling intoxicating liquors was fixed at twenty dollars per annum.\r\nThe rate of taxation was fixed at seven mills on the dollar. The first\r\nstate election in the county was held at Buena Vista, Nov. 7, 1848.\r\nOne hundred and fifteen votes were the whole number cast in the\r\ncounty. The following officers were elected: Senator, James Fisher, of\r\nCrawford county; representative, Joseph Bowron, Buena Vista; county\r\ncommissioners, Wm. H. Morse, Ammah Andrews, Harmon Crandall, Buena\r\nVista; county clerk, W. Richardson, Buena Vista; register of deeds, W.\r\nR. Anderson, Buena Vista; judge of probate court, Alvah D. Heaton,\r\nOsceola; county treasurer, Philip Aldrich, Buena Vista; coroner, Wm.\r\nO. Mahony, Osceola; surveyor, Alex. S. Youle, St. Croix Falls.\r\n\r\nAt the commissioners' meeting, Feb. 28, 1849, the county was divided\r\ninto the following towns: St. Croix Falls, Buena Vista, and Elisabeth.\r\nAt an election held Sept. 3, 1849, Hamlet H. Perkins received\r\nforty-nine votes for judge, and Joel Foster forty-one. Mr. Perkins was\r\ndrowned at St. Croix Falls soon after, and the governor appointed Mr.\r\nFoster to fill the vacancy. Judge Foster held his first court at Buena\r\nVista. Daniel Noble Johnson was appointed prosecuting attorney in\r\n1849. James Hughes was appointed in 1850. The first district court was\r\nheld in August, 1850.\r\n\r\nAt a special meeting of the commissioners in 1849, James Hughes and J.\r\nM. Bailey were appointed a building committee to make estimates for\r\nthe erection of a courthouse and jail. At the special meeting of the\r\ncommissioners, Jan. 15, 1851, the town of Kinnikinic was organized.\r\nThey had also under consideration the erection of county buildings,\r\nand appointed Ammah Andrews to erect the same. Otis Hoyt, for\r\nnon-attendance at this meeting of the board, was fined fifty dollars,\r\nbut the fine was subsequently remitted. The legislature of 1851\r\nchanged the name of the town of Buena Vista to Willow River, also of\r\nthe town of Elisabeth to Prescott. At a subsequent meeting the\r\ncontract with Ammah Andrews to erect public buildings was rescinded,\r\nand Daniel Mears was made special agent to build a jail, and three\r\nhundred and fifty dollars was appropriated for that purpose. The town\r\nof Rush River was organized Nov. 13, 1851. At the request of\r\npetitioners, the town of Leroy (now Osceola) was organized Nov. 9,\r\n1852. A day was fixed in 1852 to vote on the change of name, Willow\r\nRiver to Hudson. The name Hudson was adopted by a two-thirds majority.\r\nThe legislature of 1853 created from the territory of St. Croix county\r\nthe counties of Polk, St. Croix and Pierce, Polk being located on the\r\nnorth, Pierce on the south, and St. Croix occupying the central\r\nportion of the original St. Croix county, and retaining the county\r\nseat.\r\n\r\nSt. Croix county, as at present constituted, lies on the east bank of\r\nthe river and Lake St. Croix, forming, but for slight irregularities\r\non the western line, a parallelogram. It includes townships 28 to 31,\r\nand ranges 15 to 19, with fractions of range 20 on the west. The\r\nsurface varies from gently undulating to hilly. The bluffs along the\r\nlake are not precipitous, as on the Upper St. Croix, but are even and\r\ncontinuous, with gently rounded slopes. From the river, eastward, the\r\ncountry is broken and somewhat hilly; the central portions are rolling\r\nprairies on which are fine farms, and the eastern portions are level\r\nand originally heavily timbered. The eastern tier of townships is\r\ncovered by a heavy growth of timber known as the Big Woods. The timber\r\nis composed of basswood, maple, butternut, several species of oak, and\r\na sprinkling of white pine. The soil is a rich clayey loam and well\r\nadapted for grass, grain and root crops. Good building and limestone\r\ncrop out in places. The county is well drained by the St. Croix and\r\nits tributaries, Apple, Willow and Kinnikinic on the west and Rush\r\nriver on the east. Of these tributaries Apple river is the largest. It\r\nrises in Polk county, where it is supplied by numerous lakes, enters\r\nSt. Croix county and passes diagonally across the northwest corner and\r\nempties into the St. Croix river a few miles above Stillwater. Willow\r\nriver rises in Cylon township and empties into St. Croix lake, just\r\nabove Hudson. This river passes through a deep gorge in the limestone\r\nrock, a few miles above its mouth, falling in its passage over several\r\nledges of rock, producing falls famed far and near for their wildness\r\nand grandeur. Kinnikinic river in the south part of the county is\r\nfamed also for the beauty of its scenery and for its waterfalls. It\r\npasses into Pierce county and then, uniting with its southern branch,\r\nflows into Lake St. Croix. Rush river rises in Eau Galle, and turns\r\nand flows thence to Lake Pepin. These streams have unfailing supplies\r\nfrom springs and small lakes. There is a remarkable formation in the\r\nKinnikinic valley about seven miles above River Falls, called the\r\nMonument. It is a ledge of pure white sandstone rock, nearly circular,\r\nand rising to a height of sixty feet. It stands on a natural elevation\r\nfar above the level of the valley and so forms a very conspicuous and\r\ncurious object. The base is forty or fifty feet wide, and the summit\r\nis a turret-shaped mass of rock about fifteen feet wide and as many\r\nhigh. The part upon which the turret rests is dome-shaped, its sides\r\nworn by the rains into deep furrows. Years ago a tree grew upon the\r\nsummit. The soft sandstone is being gradually worn away by the winds\r\nand rains.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE SCHOOL LANDS WERE SELECTED.\r\n\r\nPhilip Aldrich was appointed commissioner in 1848 to locate the state\r\nschool lands in St. Croix county, at that time including Polk and\r\nPierce counties. It is said that Dr. Aldrich would climb to the\r\nsummits of the highest mounds, and, casting his eyes east, west, north\r\nor south, would proclaim such and such numbers or sections as school\r\nlands. Where all were so arable and fertile there was no use in\r\ndiscriminating. At the division of the county in 1853 the part\r\ndesignated as St. Croix county was subdivided into three towns, Buena\r\nVista or Hudson, Willow River and Kinnikinic or Troy. As the\r\npopulation increased these towns were divided and subdivided until\r\nthey numbered twenty-three. We append their names and dates of\r\norganization. Where more than one name is given the last is the\r\npresent name:\r\n\r\n    Buena Vista, Willow River, Hudson            1849\r\n    Malone, Troy                                 1851\r\n    Rush River                                   1851\r\n    Pleasant Valley                              1851\r\n    Somerset                                     1856\r\n    Hammond                                      1856\r\n    Star Prairie                                 1856\r\n    Dayton, Malone, Kinnikinic                   1857\r\n    Cold Spring, Richmond                        1857\r\n    Erin Prairie                                 1858\r\n    Brookville, Eau Galle                        1858\r\n    St. Joseph                                   1858\r\n    Cylon                                        1859\r\n    Warren                                       1860\r\n    Springfield                                  1860\r\n    Emerald                                      1861\r\n    Stanton                                      1870\r\n    Cady                                         1870\r\n    Baldwin                                      1872\r\n    Forest                                       1881\r\n    Glenwood                                     1885\r\n\r\nSome changes were also made in the boundaries of the towns. No\r\nprogress was made in the erection of county buildings until 1856, when\r\na contract was made by the commissioners with Ammah Andrews to build a\r\ncourt house for $14,300 on the ground originally purchased of Moses\r\nPerin. The final cost was $20,045.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. CROIX AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY.\r\n\r\nAn important event to the county was the organization of the St. Croix\r\nAgricultural Society, in 1857. Beautiful grounds were chosen on the\r\nbluffs one-half mile south of the city of Hudson. The annual fairs of\r\nthis association, formerly held in rotation at various points in the\r\ncounty, now limited to the grounds south of the city, have always been\r\nwell patronized and successful.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOMONA GRANGE.\r\n\r\nThe Pomona Grange of St. Croix county holds quarterly meetings at\r\nvarious points, alternately. There are subordinate granges at Hudson,\r\nRichmond, Hammond, and Warren. There is a co-operative store in the\r\ncity of Hudson which is well sustained. These granges are in a\r\nflourishing condition.\r\n\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURAL STATISTICS.\r\n\r\nAt the taking of the last census there were 2,289 farms in St. Croix\r\ncounty, containing 202,588 acres of improved land, valued at\r\n$7,015,198. The farm implements were then placed at a valuation of\r\n$346,374; live stock, at $810,525; and all soil products at\r\n$1,815,266. The stock numbered 6,272 horses, 319 mules, 442 oxen,\r\n5,624 cows, and 6,149 other cattle.\r\n\r\nThe average yield of products throughout the county can be fairly\r\nplaced at these figures: Wheat, 1,375,000 bushels; oats, 800,000\r\nbushels; rye and barley, 35,000 bushels; corn, 200,000 bushels;\r\npotatoes, 150,000 bushels; hay, 20,000 tons; cheese, 180,000 pounds;\r\nbutter, 350,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nDuring the past few years agriculture has steadily increased while\r\nrapid strides have been made in manufactures, so that the totals would\r\nbe quite materially enlarged now over those of 1885.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANUFACTURES.\r\n\r\nIn manufactures the statisticians have the county down for 112\r\nestablishments with a capital of $740,197, utilizing materials to the\r\namount of $1,105,203, evolving products to the sum of $1,488,192, and\r\npaying $107,469 in wages per annum.\r\n\r\nAs to manufactures, in round numbers there is produced in the county:\r\nLumber, 50,000,000 feet; shingles, 18,000,000: laths, 7,000,000;\r\nfurniture, $120,000; barrels, 125,000; flour, 160,000 barrels.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. CROIX POOR FARM\r\n\r\nIs located in the northwest part of Kinnikinic, section 11, on each\r\nside of the Kinnikinic river. It was purchased in 1870 for $1,000, and\r\nthe probable present value is $10,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST TAX ROLL OF ST. CROIX COUNTY, 1848.\r\n\r\nST.

R.\r\nAnderson, clerk of board of county commissioners, and an order issued\r\nto Moses Perin to collect such taxes, and pay over to the treasurer of\r\nSt. Croix county. The amounts were duly collected.\r\n\r\n\r\nHUDSON CITY.\r\n\r\nThe first settlement in St. Croix county was made on the present site\r\nof Hudson city in 1838 by Peter Bouchea, Louis Massey, Wm. Steets and\r\nJoseph Lagroo, Frenchmen, who subsisted chiefly by hunting and\r\nfishing, but who also raised garden crops of corn, beans and other\r\nvegetables. These people were contented and jovial, fond of dancing\r\nand social enjoyment. Beyond the mere pleasure of living they seemed\r\nto have but little care and were without enterprise or ambition. More\r\nenterprising and industrious people followed them to the new\r\nsettlement, and as the public lands were not open for entry until\r\n1848, settled upon the lands and made some improvements, awaiting\r\npatiently the time when they could acquire a legal title. The original\r\nclaimants of the town of Buena Vista in 1848 were Peter Bouchea, Louis\r\nMassey, Wm. Steets, Joseph Lagroo, Joseph Lenavil, ---- Revere, Ammah\r\nAndrews, W. H. and M. V. Nobles, John B. Page, Philip Aldrich, and W.\r\nR. Anderson. These parties, after the survey and prior to the entry of\r\nthe land, made an equitable division of their claims. Peter Bouchea\r\nand Louis Massey were then delegated to purchase the lands, which they\r\ndid, Bouchea purchasing the southwest quarter of southeast quarter of\r\nsection 24, township 29, range 20, and Massey, the northwest quarter\r\nof the southeast quarter of section 24, township 29, range 20. Deeds\r\nwere then made to the various claimants according to the original\r\nagreement. The first individual survey of lots was made on Massey's\r\nentry, Harvey Wilson, of Stillwater, being the surveyor. The village\r\nthus platted was at first called Buena Vista, but some confusion\r\narising as to the title of lots in 1851, the legislature changed the\r\nname of the town and village to Willow River, which, by vote of the\r\npeople in 1852, was changed to Hudson. The original proprietors of the\r\nvillage of Buena Vista were Paschal Aldrich, James Sanders, Moses\r\nPerin, James R. Patten and Joseph Abear. Additions were surveyed in\r\n1849 and 1850 by Gibson, Henning and others. To avoid confusion we\r\nshall discard the earlier names applied to what has since become the\r\ncity of Hudson and speak of it solely by its later and better known\r\nname.\r\n\r\nIn 1840 the locality, as seen from a passing steamer, seemed a\r\nwilderness of orchard oaks and maples, filling the valley of Willow\r\nriver, and clothing the slopes of the hills. A closer view might have\r\nrevealed an occasional shanty, a cabin of the first French settlers,\r\nwith small gardens, the whole inclosed by high picket fences as a\r\nprotection against strolling Indians. Seven years later loggers were\r\nat work on Willow river under Capt. J. B. Page. The same year a couple\r\nof frame houses appeared in the oak openings. The first was built by\r\nW. H. Nobles, which is still standing and is occupied by Mrs. Col.\r\nJames Hughes. The second was built by Ammah Andrews and is now\r\noccupied by Horace Champlin. In 1848 James Purinton commenced a saw\r\nmill and dam at the mouth of Willow river, which were not, completed\r\nuntil 1850. In 1848 Wm. H. Nobles started a ferry over the lake. James\r\nPurinton opened a store and Moses Perin built a hotel and boarding\r\nhouse, which stood opposite Champlin's present livery stable. In 1849\r\nMiss Richards, from Prairie du Chien, taught the first school. Mrs. A.\r\nM. Richardson, the wife of the Methodist minister, the second. A\r\nschool house was not built until 1855. John G. Putman built the\r\nBuckeye House, corner of First and Buckeye streets. Horace Barlow\r\nbuilt a residence. Mr. Stone also put up a store building. The first\r\nattorneys, Daniel Noble Johnson and Col. James Hughes, commenced\r\npractice in Hudson in 1849. The first public building stood on the lot\r\nnow occupied by the Methodist church. It burned down in the spring of\r\n1851, and an account of the fire, as published at that time, stated\r\nthat the \"court house, Methodist, Baptist, Congregational and\r\nEpiscopal churches, together with the high school buildings, were all\r\nconsumed.\" It is but fair to say that there were no regular church\r\norganizations at this time, but occasional services by local and\r\ntransient ministers. Rev. Lemuel Nobles, a Methodist minister,\r\npreached the first sermon in 1847. The first society organization was\r\nthat of the Baptists, Rev. S. T. Catlin, pastor, in 1852. In the same\r\nyear Rev. A. M. Richardson was regularly appointed as pastor of the\r\nMethodist Episcopal church. In 1855 the First Presbyterian church was\r\norganized under the pastorate of Rev. Chas. Thayer, and Rev. Wilcoxson\r\nbecame the first rector of the Episcopal church. In 1856 Rev. Father\r\nMcGee took charge of the Catholic church. In 1857 Rev. C. H. Marshall\r\nwas called to the pastorate of the Congregational church. A Norwegian\r\nLutheran church was organized in 1876. All of these church\r\norganizations have good church buildings, and the Catholic church has\r\na flourishing school connected with it. School interests were not\r\nneglected by the early settlers. A good school house was built in 1855\r\nand graded. The first deed recorded covering Hudson property was by\r\nLouis Massey and Frances, his wife, to Wm. H. Nobles; warranty;\r\nconsideration, $67.18; situate in east half of southwest quarter of\r\nsection 24, township 29, range 20.\r\n\r\n\r\nCITY GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\nHudson was incorporated as a city in 1857, and the first municipal\r\nelection was held in April of that year. The city was divided into\r\nthree wards. A. D. Gay was the first mayor. The following were the\r\nfirst aldermen: First ward, James B. Gray, Milton V. Nobles, J. M.\r\nFulton; Second ward, Alfred Day, R. A. Gridley, Chas. E. Dexter; Third\r\nward, Chas. Thayer, N. P. Lester, N. Perry. The remaining city\r\nofficers were: City clerk, O. Bell; city attorney, Cyrus L. Hall;\r\nsurveyor, Michael Lynch. At the first meeting of the city council,\r\nafter the appointment of committees on by-laws, bond sales, salaries,\r\netc., license for selling intoxicating liquors was fixed at fifty\r\ndollars per annum for hotel keepers, two hundred dollars for wholesale\r\ndealers, with various grades for retail saloons. The first license\r\nissued was to John Cyphers, for keeping saloon and billiard hall.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAYORS OF HUDSON CITY.\r\n\r\n     1. A. D. Gray,\r\n     2. Alfred Day,\r\n     3.

They have ever maintained an\r\nexcellent reputation. In 1860 Charlotte Mann was chosen principal, and\r\ntaught the eight ensuing years. A new school building was completed in\r\n1887 at a cost of $25,000. This building is devoted to high school\r\npurposes. The schools of the city are graded. There are eleven\r\ndepartments and twelve teachers. Each ward of the city has a separate\r\nbuilding. The school fund amounts to about $5,000 per annum. The\r\nschools are under the control of six commissioners.\r\n\r\n\r\nA MILITARY INSTITUTE\r\n\r\nWas organized at River Falls by Prof. J. R. Hinckley, and shortly\r\nafterward removed to Hudson, and a building worth $7,000 erected for\r\nits accommodation. In 1880 it was purchased by the Catholics, and it\r\nis now known as St. Marys Academy.\r\n\r\n\r\nMILLS AND MANUFACTORIES.\r\n\r\nThe first saw mill, as already noted, was completed in 1850. It was\r\nknown as Purinton's saw mill. Other saw mills were built, but\r\ndestroyed by fire. We have no record of ownership and losses, but\r\nestimate the aggregate of the latter as near $100,000. The Willow\r\nRiver mills, built in 1867, consist of two flouring mills, with a\r\ncapacity of four hundred barrels per day. Connected with these are a\r\nlarge elevator and cooper shop. The present proprietors are Cooper,\r\nClark & Co. The invested capital is $150,000. The Hudson Lumber\r\nCompany, in 1883, built a saw mill, below the steamboat landing. This\r\nmill has a capacity of 18,000,000 feet per annum, and has a planing\r\nmill attached. It is complete in all its departments, manufacturing\r\nall classes of lumber, from timber to mouldings. The capital stock\r\namounts to $100,000. The officers are H. A. Taylor, president; C. R.\r\nCoon, vice president; M. Herrick, secretary; F. D. Harding, treasurer;\r\nS. W. Pierce, superintendent. The Hudson Foundry and Machine Shop was\r\nestablished in 1870. The North Hudson Foundry and Car Shops are doing\r\na fine business. The Hudson Carriage Works were established in 1885,\r\nand the Hudson Furniture Manufactory in 1883. The amount invested in\r\nthis enterprise is $180,000, and it furnishes employment to one\r\nhundred men. C. R. Coon is president of the company. There are two\r\nbreweries--Moctreman's, established in 1857, and Yoerg's in 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\nBANKS.\r\n\r\nThe St. Croix Valley Bank was organized in 1855. It was a bank of\r\nissue, payable at Gordon, Wisconsin. It closed in 1857. The Hudson\r\nCity Bank, organized Sept. 10, 1856, went into operation under the\r\ngeneral law of Wisconsin, capital stock $25,000, secured by Michigan\r\nand Missouri state stocks. J. O. Henning was president and M. S.\r\nGibson, cashier. It soon closed. The Farmers and Mechanics Bank, a\r\nstate bank, went into operation in 1857 and closed the following\r\nyear. The Hudson First National Bank was organized in 1863, with a\r\ncapital of $50,000. The first officers were John Comstock, president;\r\nAlfred J. Goss, cashier. The officers in 1888 are John Comstock,\r\npresident; A. E. Jefferson, cashier. The surplus fund is $53,000. The\r\ndirectors are H. A. Taylor, H. L. Humphrey, John C. Spooner, A. L.\r\nClark, F. D. Harding, A. T. Goss, and W. H. Crowe. The Hudson Savings\r\nBank was organized in 1870, with a capital stock of $50,000. Alfred\r\nGoss, president; A. J. Goss, cashier. Alfred Goss died in 187--, but\r\nthe bank is in successful operation, the son still retaining his\r\nfather's name as head of the firm.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES HOSPITAL.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES HOSPITAL.]\r\n\r\nThe beautiful private hospital which takes the name of America's\r\npopular poet, Oliver Wendell Holmes, was opened June 7, 1887. The\r\ncredit of this hospital scheme is entirely due to Dr. Irving D.\r\nWiltrout, of Hudson, who for some years has been assiduously at work\r\nmaturing the plans. The owners are Dr. Wiltrout and the Johnston\r\nBrothers, of Boardman. The site is upon a beautiful wooded slope of\r\nWillow river, about a mile from its mouth, overlooking Lake Mallalieu,\r\nan expanse of the river, and a broad sweep of the St. Croix with its\r\nundulating banks, commanding the most delightful and extensive views.\r\nThe building is lighted by the Mather self regulating, incandescent\r\nsystem of electricity. The dynamo, engine and boilers are located in a\r\nfireproof brick structure, some distance from the building proper,\r\ncommunicating with the hospital by an underground passageway. The\r\nhospital is under the direction of the following board: President, A.\r\nJ. Goss; first vice president, John Comstock; second vice president,\r\nJohn E. Glover; secretary, Thomas Hughes; treasurer, Rev. M. Benson.\r\n\r\n\r\nWATER WORKS.\r\n\r\nThe Hudson water works, supplied from Lake St. Croix, are situated\r\nupon Liberty Hill, in the rear of the southern part of the city. They\r\nare owned by W. S. Evans. The hill is two hundred and seventeen feet\r\nabove the lake, and commands a magnificent view of the surrounding\r\ncountry. The summit is easily accessible. The city is also well\r\nsupplied with water from artesian wells, which were sunk to a depth of\r\nfive hundred feet, and afford a flow of two hundred gallons per\r\nminute.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOTELS.\r\n\r\nThe principal hotels are the Chapin House, first built in 1867, but\r\ntwice destroyed by fire. The last structure was erected in 1879, by H.\r\nA. Taylor. The Tracy House was built in 1867, the Seely House in 1873,\r\nthe Commercial Hotel in 1875, and the Central House in 1876.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT FIRE.\r\n\r\nMay 19, 1866, Hudson city was visited with a destructive\r\nconflagration. Sixty-four business houses and twenty-five residences\r\nwere destroyed. It was probably the result of accident or\r\ncarelessness. It commenced in the rear of H. A. Taylor's furniture\r\nrooms and printing office, and spread with such rapidity that it was\r\nwith the greatest difficulty that merchants and others were able to\r\nsave their valuable papers. The wind blew a gale and the flames spread\r\nand caught in every direction. The fire occurred fortunately in the\r\ndaytime or it might have been attended with a frightful loss of life.\r\nAs it was, there were many narrow escapes. The total losses from this\r\nfire were $325,000, on which there was but $75,000 insurance. A\r\ndestructive fire occurred in 1872, destroying the Chapin Hall House,\r\nvalued at $50,000, and other property to the value of $35,000, on\r\nwhich there was but $15,000 insurance. During the same year another\r\nfire occurred, destroying 30,000 bushels of wheat and the furniture of\r\nthe Chapin Hall House, which had been saved from the previous fire.\r\nThe loss was estimated at $60,000 with $16,355 insurance.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOCIAL AND BENEVOLENT ORGANIZATIONS.\r\n\r\nSt. Croix Lodge, A. F. and A. M., founded 1855; Colfax Lodge, No. 85,\r\nI. O. O. F., founded 1856; Hudson City Lodge, No. 486, I. O. G. T.,\r\nfounded 1867; Ladies' Library Association, founded 1868; St. Croix R.\r\nA. Chapter, founded 1874; Y. M. C. A., founded 1875; Nash Lodge, I. O.\r\nG. T., founded 1877; Temple of Honor, founded 1877; St. Croix\r\nCommandery, founded 1879; St. Croix Lodge, A. O. U. W., founded 1880;\r\nEquitable Union, founded 1880. In addition to the foregoing there is a\r\nvolunteer fire company, a boat club, an old settlers' club, a bible\r\nsociety, a building and loan association, and a cemetery association.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIOGRAPHICAL.\r\n\r\nLOUIS MASSEY came of a long-lived French-Canadian family. His father\r\nlived to the age of one hundred and seven and his mother to one\r\nhundred and five and he himself lived to the age of ninety-nine years.\r\nHe was born in Canada, near Montreal, in 1788. In 1805 he left home to\r\nenter the service of the British fur traders at Detroit. In his\r\neventful life he had many adventures and passed through many perils.\r\nHe was once arrested with his employer by the American authorities and\r\nonce made prisoner by the Indians. In 1812 he entered the employ of\r\nthe notorious Col. Dickson, and, while with him, made a trip from\r\nDetroit by way of Mackinaw, Green Bay, Fox and Wisconsin rivers to\r\nPrairie du Chien in a birch canoe. He made two trips in mackinaw boats\r\nfrom Prairie du Chien to New Orleans and return. In one trip he was\r\nfour months making his way from New Orleans to St. Louis. He made one\r\nvoyage in a birch canoe from Montreal via Ottawa river, Georgian bay,\r\nLake Huron, St. Marie's river and Lake Superior to Fond du Lac, at the\r\nmouth of St. Louis river, via Sandy lake and the Mississippi river to\r\nLake Winnibagoshish, and another from Fond du Lac to Brule river,\r\nacross to St. Croix river, thence to the Mississippi, and by way of\r\nSt. Peter's river to Lake Traverse by canoe. In 1818 he entered the\r\nservice of the American Fur Company, and lived at Fond du Lac, the\r\nheadquarters of the company, for ten years. There he was married to a\r\nsister of Peter Bouchea. In 1828 he settled on the reservation near\r\nFort Snelling, where he was held in such estimation that, on the\r\nexpulsion of the settlers, the officers of the Fort assisted him in\r\nhis removal to Willow River, whither he came in 1838 with Peter\r\nBouchea. Wm. Steets and Joseph Lagroo soon followed them. These four\r\nwere the first settlers in Hudson. Mr. Massey lived at his old home\r\nwith a son-in-law, Richard Picard, until his death, Oct. 14, 1887. His\r\nonly child living is Mrs. Picard.\r\n\r\nPETER BOUCHEA was born at Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, about 1815. He\r\nspent his early life in the neighborhood of Lake Superior, was married\r\nto a daughter of ---- Bruce, and came to the mouth of Willow river in\r\n1838. Mr. Bouchea had been educated for the Catholic priesthood. He\r\nwas a truthful, intelligent, reliable man and filled some positions of\r\nresponsibility. He had many stirring adventures and was once wounded\r\nby Indians and cared for by Gov. Cass, of Michigan, at Detroit and\r\nFort Gratiot. He died in 1875, at Fort Edward, on the north shore of\r\nLake Superior.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM STREETS came to Willow River in 1838, a refugee from the Fort\r\nSnelling reservation. He was frozen to death in the winter of 1851.\r\n\r\nCAPT. JOHN B. PAGE came from Piscataquis county, Maine, to the St.\r\nCroix valley in 1844, and engaged for awhile in cutting pine logs on\r\nWillow river. While rafting on the Mississippi he met, and after a\r\nbrief courtship married, a woman who returned with him to his home on\r\nWillow river and who survives him. Mrs. Page had some reputation as a\r\n(Thomsonian) physician. They made their home in Hudson in 1847. Their\r\ndaughter Abigail was the first white child of American descent born in\r\nHudson. Abigail married George Bailey, and their sons, George W. and\r\nDavid, were for a long time residents of Hudson, and have but lately\r\ndeceased. Mr. Page died Feb. 11, 1865.\r\n\r\nDR. PHILIP ALDRICH, although not a permanent settler till 1847, was an\r\noccasional or transient visitor, and had made a land claim in section\r\n24. He took a deep interest in the affairs of the pioneer settlement,\r\nand at his house many of the public gatherings, political and social,\r\nwere held. He was the first postmaster, and, in the exigencies of the\r\nservice, sometimes carried the mail on foot. While a resident of St.\r\nCroix Falls in 1844, he was appointed probate judge. In 1848 he was\r\nappointed treasurer of the county of St. Croix, and at the election in\r\nNovember of the same year, elected to that office. Dr. Aldrich was\r\nborn in New York in 1792, and died at his home in Hudson, March 16,\r\n1858.\r\n\r\nTHE NOBLES FAMILY settled in Hudson in 1847. Rev. Lemuel Nobles, the\r\nfather, was a Methodist local minister, and in 1847 preached the first\r\nsermon at the mouth of Willow river. He came originally from New York,\r\nlived a few years in the valley and removed to Michigan, where he\r\ndied. His children were William H., Milton V., John, Mrs. Battles and\r\nMrs. Morton S. Wilkinson, deceased. Wm. H. became a resident of\r\nMinnesota and a noted man. His biography is given elsewhere.\r\n\r\nMILTON V. NOBLES was born in New York in 1818; removed to Michigan;\r\nwas married to Matilda Edwards, Sept. 2, 1846, in Stillwater, and came\r\nto Hudson in 1847, where he followed lumbering until 1860, when he\r\nreturned to New York and located at Elmira, where he resided until his\r\ndeath. While at Elmira he became an inventor and took out several\r\nvaluable patents. His fortunes varied, and as is frequently the case\r\nwith inventors, at one time he was wretchedly poor. In the midst of\r\nhis galling poverty he sold one of his patents for a beautiful\r\nhomestead in Elmira. Mrs. Nobles had not been informed of the\r\ntransaction, but with her husband had visited the occupants of the\r\nhomestead. Mrs. Nobles could not but contrast this pleasant home with\r\nher own poverty stricken surroundings, and in inviting her\r\nentertainers to return the call, told them plainly that she lived in a\r\nvery humble home, and feared she could not make a visit pleasant to\r\nthem. At this point the host stepped forward, and, by a preconcerted\r\narrangement, presented her a deed to the mansion and grounds--a joyful\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\nJOHN NOBLES, the youngest son, returned to Michigan and New York,\r\nwhere he became a Methodist minister. Some time subsequently he\r\nremoved to Colorado, where he died.\r\n\r\nJAMES PURINTON was born in 1797, in Tamworth, New Hampshire. He was\r\nmarried to Mary Mann, in Sandwich, New Hampshire. He afterward removed\r\nto Maine. He came to St. Croix Falls in 1842, and leased the St. Croix\r\nmills, and some time after became part owner. This venture not being\r\nsuccessful, he removed to Willow River in 1847, where he built a large\r\ndam across the river, and with others erected a saw mill on the point\r\nof land between the lake and river. This venture was not successful\r\nand the mill property passed into other hands. Mr. Purinton was an\r\nexperienced lumberman and an active, energetic man. The north side of\r\nWillow River, in which he was so much interested, became afterward\r\nquite valuable on account of the centralization of shops, depots and\r\nbusiness of the West Wisconsin and North Wisconsin railroads. Mr.\r\nPurinton died in Hudson in 1849, leaving two married daughters--Mrs.\r\n----Graves and Mrs. James McPhail.\r\n\r\nAMMAH ANDREWS was born in Herkimer county, New York, in 1801, and\r\npassed his early life in that place. In 1829 he was married to Laura\r\nAndrews, and in the same year moved to Michigan. He came to Hudson in\r\n1847. Mr. Andrews was a carpenter and took some important building\r\ncontracts. He was one of the first commissioners of St. Croix county\r\nunder the state government, and also one of the first school\r\ndirectors. He has been an active and influential member of the\r\nMethodist Episcopal church the greater part of his life. He has three\r\nsons, now living in Nebraska, and one daughter, the wife of F. D.\r\nHarding, of Hudson, Wisconsin. Mr. Andrews died Jan. 5, 1888.\r\n\r\nJAMES WALSTOW.--Mr. Walstow was born in Nottingham, England, in 1815;\r\nwas married there, and came to Hudson in 1849. He removed to Nebraska\r\nin 1863.\r\n\r\nJAMES SANDERS was born in Devonshire, England, in 1818; came to\r\nAmerica in 1841, and lived for years in New York. In 1844 he married\r\nMary Walstow, removed to St. Croix Falls in 1845 and to Hudson in\r\n1850, where he opened and improved the first farm in the present St.\r\nCroix county. Mrs. Sanders died in 1873. She left two sons, William\r\nand Walstow. Mr. Sanders removed to Osceola in 1880.\r\n\r\nJ. W. STONE was born in Connecticut in 1800. He came to Hudson in 1849\r\nand opened the first store the same year. He died in 1860.\r\n\r\nJOSEPH BOWRON was born Aug. 1, 1809, in Essex county, New York. His\r\nparents were from Newcastle on the Tyne, England. His mother was a\r\nmember of the Society of Friends. She died when Joseph was five years\r\nold, and he was reared by his aunt until nineteen years of age, when\r\nhe engaged in business for himself in Lower Canada. Some time\r\nafterward he removed to the United States and obtained work on the\r\nIllinois canal. He next removed to St. Louis, and from thence, in\r\n1841, to St. Croix Falls, where he acted as clerk, scaler of logs and\r\nmill superintendent. He was a member of the first state legislature of\r\nWisconsin, in 1848. W. R. Marshall had received the certificate of\r\nelection, but Mr. Bowron successfully contested the election. Mr.\r\nBowron removed in 1848 to Hudson, where he attended to general\r\ncollections, and served as justice of the peace. In 1849 Mr. Bowron\r\nwas married to Celia Partridge, of Columbia county, Wisconsin, who\r\ndied three years later. In 1854 he was married to Rosanna Partridge,\r\nwho died in 1863. Mr. Bowron died April 10, 1868, leaving two\r\nchildren, who now reside in Kansas.\r\n\r\nMOSES PERIN was born in 1815; came to St. Croix Falls in 1847 and to\r\nHudson in 1849. He was the first collector of St. Croix county. In\r\n1853 he built a warehouse and saw mill at Lakeland, Minnesota. The\r\nwarehouse was burned, and the saw mill removed. In 1847 Mr. Perin\r\nremoved to San Diego, California.\r\n\r\nJOHN O. HENNING was born at Bellefonte, Centre county, Pennsylvania,\r\nin 1819. His great grandfather was the first settler in that county.\r\nIn 1825 his father removed to Ithaca, New York, and there the youthful\r\nHenning received his education at the academy. During the excitement\r\nof the Jackson administration he became an ardent Democrat, and, that\r\nhe might enter more fully into the political strife of the day,\r\nlearned the printer's trade and devoted himself more or less to\r\nnewspaper work. He visited the Mississippi valley in 1838, remained\r\nsome time at St. Louis, Missouri, Springfield, Illinois, Burlington,\r\nIowa, and some other places. In 1846 he established the _Journal_ at\r\nFond du Lac, Wisconsin, and in 1849 removed to Hudson, Wisconsin,\r\nwhere he still resides. He served eight years as register of the\r\nUnited States land office at that place. He represented St. Croix\r\ncounty in the assembly of the Fourth Wisconsin legislature and has\r\nheld many other positions of trust. Mr. Henning was married, Jan. 29,\r\n1840, to Fidelia Bennet. Mrs. Henning died June 27, 1886, aged\r\nsixty-six years.\r\n\r\nMOSES S. GIBSON was born in 1816, in Livingston county, New York. He\r\nreceived the rudiments of a common school education. He was engaged in\r\nmercantile pursuits a large portion of his life. He settled at\r\nSheboygan, Wisconsin, in 1844, but afterward moved to Fond du Lac. He\r\nrepresented Fond du Lac county in the constitutional convention in\r\n1847. He was appointed receiver of the United States land office at\r\nHudson in 1849. In 1856 he was married to Carrie F. Gilman. During the\r\nRebellion he acted as paymaster, United States army, and was assigned\r\nto the department of Missouri, with headquarters at St. Louis. In 1878\r\nhe was appointed assistant in the sixth auditor's office, Washington,\r\nDistrict of Columbia. Mr. Gibson has led a busy and useful life and\r\nhas acquitted himself well in the various positions of responsibility\r\nto which he has been called.\r\n\r\nCOL. JAMES HUGHES.--Col. Hughes was born in Prince Edwards county,\r\nVirginia, Oct. 12, 1805. He received a classical education at\r\nHampdon-Sydney College, Virginia, studied law, and was admitted to\r\npractice in Virginia. He came to Ohio in 1835, and was elected to the\r\nlegislature in 1838 and 1839. He was married in 1839 to Elisabeth\r\nMather, in Jackson county. He remained in Ohio until 1849, publishing\r\nsuccessively the _Jackson Standard_ and the _Meigs County Telegraph_,\r\nboth Whig papers. In 1849 he came to St. Paul and brought with him the\r\nfirst printing press and outfit in that city, and established the\r\n_Minnesota Chronicle,_ which subsequently united with the _Register_.\r\nThe first number bears the date June 1, 1849. In November of the same\r\nyear he sold his interest in the _Chronicle and Register_ and removed\r\nto Hudson, where he established the _St. Croix Banner_, the first\r\npaper printed and issued in the St. Croix valley. Mrs. Hughes was\r\nassociated with him in its management. They subsequently published the\r\nHudson _Republican_.

By the setting off of Pierce county from St. Croix, the\r\ntowns in township 27 were stricken off, and the territory has since\r\nbeen reduced until comprised in township 28, range 18. It is a wealthy\r\nagricultural township. Its surface is agreeably diversified with\r\nundulating prairies and high hills. The Kinnikinic, a beautiful and\r\nclear winding stream, drains it from the northeast. The famous\r\nMonument Rock, an outlying sandstone formation, is in the centre of\r\nthis township. From the summit a magnificent view may be obtained of\r\nthis fine farming region. The farmers have fine dwellings and barns,\r\nand the town has numerous school houses; one church is located on\r\nsection 15. The history of the town, as far as we were able to obtain\r\nit, may be found in the biographies of the Mapes brothers.\r\n\r\nDUNCAN MCGREGOR was born in Perth, Scotland, in 1821. His educational\r\nadvantages were limited. He emigrated to Canada while yet a youth,\r\nserved seven years in the British Army, and was one year in Canada\r\nduring the Papineau Rebellion. He was married to Jane Morse, in\r\nCanada, Jan. 31, 1848, and in 1849 removed to the United States and\r\nsettled at River Falls, where he still lives on the homestead which he\r\npre-empted. Mrs. McGregor was the first resident white woman, and Mr.\r\nMcGregor the second person who settled at the Falls.\r\n\r\nHis mother, an aged lady living with him at the Falls, at one time\r\nfound the house surrounded by over a hundred Sioux Indians, who\r\ncommenced plundering the garden of everything eatable. Mrs. McGregor\r\nbravely confronted and drove them away. The only crops in the valley\r\nat the time were those of Messrs. Foster and McGregor.\r\n\r\nMr. McGregor learned in early life the trade of a mason. While a\r\nresident of River Falls he followed farming except during a few years\r\nin which he kept a hardware store. He was three years county\r\ncommissioner of St. Croix county. He has three children living,\r\nRoderick, Malcolm and Neville.\r\n\r\nW. B. AND JAS. A. MAPES, brothers, from Elmira, New York, landed at\r\nWillow River Sept. 7, 1849. They proceeded at once with an ox team and\r\ncart, on which last was placed all their worldly goods, to the valley\r\nof the Kinnikinic. Having selected a claim and erected a temporary\r\nshanty, William B. returned by river as far as Galena, for a breaking\r\nteam, wagon and plow, and other farm furniture and provisions, while\r\nJames remained to make hay. After the brother's return, a substantial\r\nwinter cabin was built. The ensuing spring they broke ground and\r\nraised a fair crop, consisting of 80 bushels of oats, 200 of\r\nbuckwheat, 100 of corn and 100 of potatoes. The winter of their\r\narrival, Duncan McGregor came to the settlement and spent the winter\r\nwith Judge Foster. In the fall of 1850 came Ira Parks and family, and\r\nsettled on lands adjoining the Mapes farm. This family and others were\r\nentertained by the Mapes brothers, with genuine frontier hospitality.\r\nAmong the families coming in at this time were those of Dr. Whipple,\r\nMrs. Sprague, Lorenzo Daggett, and the widow of Josephus Medley, of\r\nStillwater. This year came also the Pomeroy brothers, Luke and Frank,\r\nfrom New York State, and J. G. Crowns, James Penn, and William Tozer,\r\nfrom Illinois. During 1851 several families settled in the valley,\r\namong them James Chinnoch and Elisha Walden, from Ohio; Alanson Day\r\nand John Scott, from Pennsylvania; the brothers W. L. and J. E.\r\nPerrin, single men, from New York State, and Mrs. Lynch, from\r\nIllinois. Previous to the settlement of these families there were no\r\nyoung ladies in the town. The arrival of fifteen young ladies, mostly\r\nmarriageable, produced a flutter of excitement among the lonesome\r\nbachelors of the colony, and the services of Rev. S. T. Catlin were\r\nsoon called into requisition. The first couple married was James A.\r\nMapes and Eunice E. Walden, in 1852. The next year W. B. Mapes and\r\nCatherine Scott were married. In 1852 J. W. Mapes, a younger brother,\r\njoined the colony. In 1857 G. W. Mapes located a Mexican War land\r\nwarrant on adjoining laud. W. B., J. A. and C. W. Mapes had also\r\nMexican War land warrants.\r\n\r\nIn 1860 J. W. Mapes sold his farm and returned to New York, enlisted\r\nin the One Hundred and First Pennsylvania Volunteers, and served\r\nthrough the Peninsular Campaign under McClellan, and afterward in\r\nNorth Carolina, where he was captured at Plymouth, April 23, 1864, and\r\ntaken to Andersonville, where he died, June 30, 1864. W. B. Mapes sold\r\nhis farm to Chas. Davies and removed to Macon county, Mississippi, in\r\n1866, at which place he died in 1877. His widow and five children\r\nstill reside there. C. W. Mapes sold his farm to G. I. Ap Roberts, and\r\nkept store for awhile in the village, and in 1879 removed to Sussex\r\ncounty, Virginia, where he still resides. He has four children living.\r\nJas. A. Mapes still resides on the old homestead. Mr. Mapes was\r\nhonored with an election to the office of treasurer for St. Croix\r\ncounty in 1883 and 1884.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLEASANT VALLEY.\r\n\r\nPleasant Valley includes the west half of township 28, range 17.

Densmore; assessor, W. R. Anderson;\r\ntreasurer, G. W. Law. The first post office was established at the\r\nhouse of Joel Bartlett, who served as postmaster. This post office was\r\nknown as the Richmond post office. It was a small affair. The first\r\nmail, brought on a mule's back from Maiden Rock, contained but one\r\nletter. The first quarter's commission amounted to but one dollar and\r\nfifty-nine cents. The post office case contained but four boxes, five\r\nby six inches in size. This case is preserved at the _Republican_\r\noffice, as an interesting relic. Small as was the office, and meagre\r\nas were the receipts, the postmaster was able to employ a deputy, F.\r\nW. Bartlett. By way of agreeable contrast we give the commission for\r\nthe first quarter of 1886 as $674.89.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOARDMAN VILLAGE\r\n\r\nIs located on the east bank of Willow river and near the western\r\nboundary of Richmond.

In 1830 he was a member of the Maine legislature; in 1849 and\r\n1850 he followed lumbering in Fairfield, Maine, and then removed to\r\nNew York where he lived six years. In 1858 he came to New Richmond,\r\nwhere he has since led an active business life. Mr. Bartlett was\r\nmarried in Maine in 1826. One of his sons, J. A., is a Presbyterian\r\nclergyman in Centreville, Iowa. He graduated at Waterville College,\r\nMaine, and practiced law three years in New York City before entering\r\nthe ministry.\r\n\r\nFRANCIS W. BARTLETT, the second son of Joel Bartlett, was born in\r\nMaine in 1837. He received an academic education, and has been an\r\nactive and successful business man. He came to New Richmond in 1858,\r\nand served as register of the land office at Bayfield from 1861 to\r\n1867. He was married in 1867 to Mary J. Stewart, of Pennsylvania. He\r\nwas engaged in the coal trade in Milwaukee three years, and two years\r\nat Detroit and Toledo, but returned to New Richmond and is now\r\npresident of the New Richmond Bank, and dealer in furniture, hardware,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nGEORGE C. HOUGH was born in Fairfax county, Virginia, in ----. He has\r\nled a somewhat adventurous life. He served awhile as a soldier in the\r\nBlack Hawk War under Gen. Dodge. Afterward he went to Missouri,\r\ngraduated at the State University, and engaged in lead mining and\r\nprospecting. He went to California in 1862, where he practiced law. He\r\nreturned in 1876, and located in Richmond where he still resides.\r\n\r\nSILAS STAPLES was born in Lisbon, Maine, Sept. 18, 1814. He came to\r\nHudson, Wisconsin, in 1854, took charge of the Willow River mills,\r\nbuying a quarter interest at $20,000, including 5,000 acres of land on\r\nWillow river. In 1856 he sold his interest to Jewell and Bodie, of\r\nMaine, for $55,000, and for three years carried on a banking business\r\nin Hudson. In the winter of 1859-60 he removed to New Richmond. In\r\n1861 he returned to Hudson and put up a shingle and lath addition to\r\nhis saw mill. He built a flouring mill at New Richmond in 1864. He\r\nbuilt large dams on Willow river for driving logs, and carried on\r\nlumbering operations until 1868, when he removed to Canada and carried\r\non milling and lumbering enterprises four years, at Collins' Inlet,\r\nGeorgian bay. In 1872 he returned to Hudson and to a farm, and was\r\nalso engaged with Mr. Gibson in mercantile business. In 1873 he\r\nreturned to New Richmond, and, buying a half interest in the mill,\r\ntook charge of it for one year, then removed to Stillwater and took\r\ncharge of his brother's (Isaac Staples) saw mill.\r\n\r\nIn 1875 he removed to Elk River, Minnesota, and took charge of a farm.\r\nThe next year he returned to New Richmond, where he settled his family\r\nand bought a half interest in a saw and grist mill at Jeweltown. He\r\nalso built an elevator there with a capacity of 20,000 bushels.\r\n\r\nMr. Staples was married in 1837 to Hannah Williams, of Bowdoinham,\r\nMaine, who died in 1838. He was married in 1841 to Abigail Ann Rogers\r\nof Oldtown, Maine, who died in the spring of 1845. He was married in\r\nthe fall of 1846 to Nancy D. Gilman, who died in 1873. He was married\r\nto Mrs. Nancy B. Jamison in the fall of 1874. He has six children,\r\nCharles A., Silas G., Nellie B., Nettie, Edward P, and Lizzie G.\r\n\r\nHENRY M. MURDOCK.--Dr. Murdock was born at Antwerp, New York, in\r\nOctober, 1823. His father, Dr. Hiram Murdock, moved to Gunning, at\r\nwhich place the son attended school till he was fifteen years of age.\r\nThe father moved to Pulaski, New York. Henry studied medicine with his\r\nfather until he was nineteen years of age, then attended medical\r\nlectures at Castleton, Virginia, where he graduated at the age of\r\ntwenty-one. After practicing three years at Dexter, and after a\r\nco-partnership of seven years with his father in a drug store at\r\nPulaski, he came West and settled in Stillwater, where he bought the\r\ndrug store and business of Dr. Carli. In 1858 he went to Taylor's\r\nFalls and practiced medicine until the spring of 1860, when he removed\r\nto Hudson and formed a partnership with Dr. Hoyt. In the fall of 1861\r\nhe accepted the position of assistant surgeon of the Eighth Wisconsin,\r\nand served during the war, having been promoted meanwhile to the\r\nposition of brigade surgeon. In 1866 he removed to New Richmond, where\r\nhe has since resided, having now retired from business. He was twice\r\nmarried, in 1845 to Cornelia A. Sandford, who died childless, and in\r\n1865 to Sarah J. Allan. His children are Cornelia A. and Henry A.\r\n\r\nSTEVEN N. HAWKINS was born in Galway, Ireland, Dec. 26, 1846, but\r\nwhile he was a mere child his parents emigrated to America; remained a\r\nfew years in Connecticut; came West in 1855, and made their home in\r\nPleasant Valley, St. Croix county. His early life was marked by the\r\nusual vicissitudes of life in a new country. He tried for a time\r\nvarious occupations--farm work, rafting, sawing lumber, teaching, and,\r\nduring the later months of the war, was a volunteer soldier. He\r\nmanaged to secure a good education in the common schools and at the\r\nRiver Falls Academy. He studied medicine and surgery a few months, but\r\ndevoted himself chiefly to teaching until 1872, when he engaged in a\r\nmercantile enterprise at which he continued four years, but at the\r\nclose of that period found himself obliged to suspend, with an\r\naggregate of $5,000 against him. This he afterward paid, but he\r\nconcluded, perhaps wisely, to change his occupation. He studied law,\r\nand was admitted to the bar, July, 1876. In this profession he has\r\nachieved an enviable success. In 1872 he was married to Margaret\r\nEarly, of Alleghany county, New York. They have had four children, the\r\nfirst of which died in infancy.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSH RIVER\r\n\r\nOccupies the east half of township 28, range 17. The first settlement\r\nwas made in 1850. The following came in 1850-51: Daniel McCartney,\r\nAmos Babcock, Joseph King, Stephen Claggitt and Z. Travis. The town\r\nwas set off from Kinnikinic and organized in 1851, with Daniel\r\nMcCartney as chairman of the board of supervisors. At his house was\r\nheld the first election.\r\n\r\nWoodside has one church and several buildings, is near the centre of\r\nthe town, and New Centreville in the southern part. The date of\r\nsettlement is second to that of Hudson. It was traversed by the old\r\nHudson and Prairie du Chien stage route. It was originally a mixed\r\ntimber and prairie district.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMERSET\r\n\r\nOccupies sections 1 to 18, inclusive, of township 30, range 19, two\r\nsections of township 30, range 20, and all of township 31, range 19,\r\nlying east of the St. Croix river. The surface is generally\r\nundulating, but along the St. Croix and Apple rivers abrupt and hilly.\r\nThe first settlers were French colonists at Apple River Falls in 1851.\r\nThey built a school house and Catholic church upon the bluffs below\r\nthe falls. The latter is a conspicuous object as seen from the St.\r\nCroix river. The falls of Apple river, about one and a half miles\r\nabove its junction with the St. Croix, is one of the finest of the\r\nWisconsin waterfalls. Apple river traverses the county from northeast\r\nto southwest. The Wisconsin Central railroad crosses the southern\r\npart. The town of Somerset was organized Sept. 19, 1856, with Thomas\r\nJ. Chappell as chairman of supervisors. Mr. Chappell was also\r\nappointed postmaster in 1854 at Apple River Falls.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMERSET VILLAGE,\r\n\r\nLocated about three miles above the Falls, has a good improved water\r\npower, a flour mill with a capacity of one hundred and fifty barrels\r\nper day, and a saw mill, built and owned by Gen. Sam Harriman, the\r\nfounder of the village. In 1856 a church and school house were erected\r\nat a cost of about $12,000.\r\n\r\nSAMUEL HARRIMAN.--Gen. Harriman was born in Orland, Maine. He spent\r\nfour years in California, engaged in mining and lumbering, and dug the\r\nsecond canal in the State for sluicing purposes. He came to Somerset\r\nin 1859, and has ever since made it his residence. He is one of the\r\nfounders and platters of the village, and built most of the houses,\r\nincluding the hotel and two stores on the east side of Apple river,\r\nand all the dwelling houses on the west side. He has been remarkably\r\nsuccessful in the various pursuits to which he has turned his\r\nattention, and may well be considered a man of remarkable executive\r\nability. He has a farm of five hundred and fifty-five acres, and his\r\nagricultural and stock products are second to none. As a lumberman he\r\nhas cut 3,000,000 feet per year. He has a rotary saw mill with a\r\nplaning, lath and shingle mill attached, and under the same roof he\r\nhas a flouring mill and six run of stone; he has a large store in\r\nwhich he keeps a general stock of merchandise; he has also a cooper\r\nshop, where he makes his own barrels, a warehouse and a blacksmith\r\nshop. He has also an excellent stone quarry on his premises.\r\n\r\nWe look in vain for his name in the Wisconsin blue book, or among the\r\nlist of office holders. He has been too busy to turn aside in quest of\r\npolitical preferment. We believe, however, that he was commissioned as\r\nnotary public by Govs. Taylor and Smith. When men were needed for the\r\ndefense of the country he left his interests to enlist as a private.\r\nHis military record is brilliant. He enlisted in Company A, Thirtieth\r\nWisconsin Volunteer Infantry, June 10, 1862, was made captain on the\r\norganization of the company, which position he held till Feb. 16,\r\n1864, when he was commissioned colonel of the Thirty-seventh\r\nWisconsin Infantry. This regiment was recruited by Col. Harriman, he\r\nhaving been commissioned for that purpose. Its services on many a hard\r\nfought field, and especially about Petersburg, is a matter of well\r\nknown history. Its most memorable action occurred on the thirtieth of\r\nJuly, just after the explosion of the mine under the enemy's fort.\r\nCol. Harriman, with the Thirty-seventh Wisconsin, was ordered to\r\noccupy the dismantled fort, which he did under a heavy fire, and the\r\nwalls had been so leveled as to afford but slight protection from the\r\nenemy's batteries. While in possession they repelled all attempts to\r\ndislodge them until four o'clock the next morning, when, receiving no\r\nsupport, the Thirty-seventh Regiment,\r\n\r\n    \"All that was left of them,\"\r\n\r\nfell back to the line. At roll call that evening, of two hundred and\r\nfifty men that answered to their names before the action, only\r\nninety-five responded. The remnant of the regiment was attached to a\r\nnew brigade, of which Col. Harriman was commissioned commander. On the\r\ntenth of September, the war having ended, the tattered flag of the\r\nThirty-seventh was returned to the governor of the State and Brig.\r\nGen. Harriman returned to private life and his business enterprises.\r\n\r\nThe general is a genial, kind hearted man, fond of a good joke and\r\nstory, even though they are at his own expense. He narrates of\r\nhimself, that when mustered out of the service at Washington he was\r\naddressed as _General_ Harriman; on his way home he was saluted as\r\n_colonel_; when nearing Wisconsin, he was hailed as _major;_ in the\r\nState, as _captain_; in St. Croix county and at home as Mr. Harriman;\r\nwhen met by the boys, they greeted him with \"_Hello, Sam._\"\r\n\r\n\r\nST. JOSEPH\r\n\r\nIncludes the three lower tiers of sections of township 30, range 19,\r\nfractions of range 20, and the six upper sections of township 29,\r\nrange 19. Willow river traverses the southeast corner. The surface\r\nvaries from undulating to hilly. In the eastern part of the town is\r\nBalsam lake, a picturesque body of water two miles in length. There\r\nare also two high elevations of land, or ridges, that serve as\r\nconspicuous landmarks. The earliest settlers came in 1850, and located\r\non farms in different parts of the town. St. Joseph was organized in\r\n1858. The North Wisconsin railroad passes through the southeast corner\r\nof the town.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOULTON.\r\n\r\nOpposite Stillwater, on the shore of the lake, is a platted village\r\nknown as Houlton, which has improved much during the last few years.\r\nJ. S. Anderson & Co. built a large saw mill at this place, which has\r\nchanged ownership several times. The residences of the village are on\r\nthe high bluffs overlooking the lake, and commanding from a point two\r\nhundred feet above the level of the water a most magnificent view,\r\nincluding Stillwater, Hudson and Lakeland.\r\n\r\n\r\nBURKHARDT VILLAGE\r\n\r\nIs situated upon Willow river, just above the Falls. Joseph Bowron and\r\nothers built a mill here in 1851. The mill property changed hands many\r\ntimes, and finally passed into the hands of Burkhardt. In March, 1887,\r\nthe mill was consumed, with a loss to Mr. Burkhardt of $100,000, an\r\nimmense loss, representing the earnings of a lifetime; but with\r\ntireless energy Mr. Burkhardt went to work rebuilding, and, it is to\r\nbe hoped, will soon re-establish his thriving business. There is one\r\nchurch near Burkhardt.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD,\r\n\r\nAt its organization in 1860, embraced its own territory and that of\r\nBaldwin, set off in 1872. It now includes township 29, range 15. It\r\nwas originally covered with pine and hardwood timber. Within the last\r\nfew years it has been improved and much of the timber land is used for\r\nfarming. It is drained by the headwaters and tributaries of Rush and\r\nMenomonie rivers. The West Wisconsin railroad passes through the\r\nsouthern tier of sections, and a branch road, leading southward into a\r\npine district, has a junction at Hersey. Most of the early settlers\r\nwere Union soldiers. Among them were S. T. Adams, Thomas Ross, Isaac\r\nBurgitt and Capt. Rogers. Springfield was organized Nov. 15, 1860,\r\nwith J. R. Ismon as chairman, and Perrin and Hall as supervisors.\r\n\r\n\r\nHERSEY.\r\n\r\nThe village of Hersey, located on section 28, is a station on the West\r\nWisconsin and branch railroad, has a lumber mill, and is a flourishing\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILSON VILLAGE,\r\n\r\nSection 35, is also a station on the West Wisconsin road, and an\r\nimportant manufacturing place. The village is owned and controlled by\r\nthe Wilson Manufacturing Company, which has a capital stock of\r\n$150,000. There is one church in the village.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTANTON\r\n\r\nWas set off from Star Prairie and organized Dec. 30, 1870, with\r\nTrueworthy Jewell as chairman of supervisors. It is a rich prairie\r\ntown, well drained by the waters of Apple and Willow rivers, and well\r\ncultivated. The North Wisconsin railroad passes southwest to northeast\r\nthrough this town. Star Prairie village lies partly in this town and\r\npartly in the town of Star Prairie. There are two church buildings in\r\nthe town of Stanton.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTAR PRAIRIE,\r\n\r\nTownship 31, range 18, was organized Jan. 28, 1856. At its\r\norganization it included township 31, ranges 17 and 18, and north half\r\nof township 30, ranges 17 and 18. The first election was held at the\r\nhouse of B. C. B. Foster, in New Richmond. Apple river flows through\r\nthe town from northeast to southwest. Cedar lake, in the northeast\r\npart, furnishes at its outlet a good water power. Among the first\r\nsettlers were the Jewell brothers, Ridder and sons.\r\n\r\n\r\nHUNTINGTON VILLAGE\r\n\r\nIs located near the outlet of Cedar lake and on the stream by which\r\nthe waters of the lake are borne to Apple river. It has a large\r\nflouring mill.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTAR PRAIRIE VILLAGE,\r\n\r\nLying partially in sections 1 and 12 and partially in Stanton, has a\r\nsaw and flouring mill, a hotel, a school house and two churches, with\r\nsome fine residences.\r\n\r\nHON. R. K. FAY, born in 1822, came from New York to Wisconsin in 1849,\r\nlocating at Princeton, where he resided for nine years, most of the\r\ntime engaged as the principal of the high school at that place. He was\r\na man of sterling character, who is remembered as an able teacher and\r\npublic spirited citizen. He has been assemblyman from Adams and St.\r\nCroix counties, and a county superintendent of schools, and has taught\r\nschool forty-nine terms. When a member from St. Croix county, he\r\nintroduced the bill requiring the constitutions of the United States\r\nand of Wisconsin to be taught in the common schools. He died at his\r\nhome in Star Prairie, Jan 5, 1888. Five sons and five daughters\r\nsurvive him. His wife died about three years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\nTROY,\r\n\r\nTownship 28, range 19, and fractional township 28, range 19,\r\nconsisting of about three sections, lying along the shore of Lake St.\r\nCroix, has a fine frontage of bluffs overlooking the lake, with rich,\r\nlevel prairie lands stretching away eastward. The Kinnikinic river\r\nflows through the southeast corner of the township. It was organized\r\nin 1851 as Malone, the name having been chosen by the Perrin brothers,\r\nwho came from Malone, New York, in 1851. The name, some years later,\r\nwas changed to Troy. The Hudson & Ellsworth railroad passes diagonally\r\nthrough the township from northwest to southeast.\r\n\r\nThe village of Glenmont, section 25, township 28, range 20, lies on\r\nthe shore of Lake St. Croix. It contains a large saw mill, built by\r\nthe Lord brothers. It has since changed hands.\r\n\r\nThe village of East Troy, in section 36, has recently been annexed by\r\nlegislative enactment to the city of River Falls.\r\n\r\nJAMES CHINNOCK, the first settler in Troy, was born in Somersetshire,\r\nEngland, in 1810. He officiated twelve years at Bristol Harbor,\r\nEngland, as superintendent of docks and vessels. He was married in\r\nEngland to Harriet Owens; came to America in 1841, lived in Ohio until\r\n1850, when he came to Hudson and immediately located a claim within\r\nthe present limits of Troy. He raised the first crop in the town, and\r\nbuilt the first house, of stone, for greater protection from the\r\nIndians. Mr. Chinnock made his home upon this farm until his death in\r\n1870. He left a widow and four sons, three of them farmers in Troy.\r\nOne son, James T., has been register of deeds for St. Croix county\r\nfrom 1885 to 1888.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM LEWIS PERRIN was born in 1825, and with his brother came to\r\nTroy in 1851, where he has since lived. He has been a successful\r\nfarmer and public spirited citizen, and has filled offices in the town\r\norganization. He was married in 1855 to Julia F. Loring. They have\r\nthree sons and one daughter.\r\n\r\n\r\nWARREN,\r\n\r\nTownship 29, range 18, is a rich prairie town, drained by the\r\ntributaries of Kinnikinic and Willow river. George Longworth and\r\nfamily, of Waukegan, Illinois, settled here in October, 1855. In the\r\nyear following, Lyman and David Sanford, brothers, came from Ohio, and\r\nmade their home here. Mr. Longworth, in 1856, broke the first ground\r\non land now within the limits of Hudson. Henry M. Sanford came in the\r\nspring of 1857.\r\n\r\nWarren was organized as a town in 1860, with the following\r\nsupervisors: Beach Sanford, George Frissell and Seth Colbeth; L. J.\r\nSanford, clerk. A post office was established in 1860, and Mrs. Beach\r\nSanford was appointed postmistress, at Warren village, now Roberts.\r\nThe village of Roberts is located on the West Wisconsin railroad,\r\nwhich traverses sections 19 to 24, inclusive, of this town. It\r\ncontains one elevator, one storage house, one feed mill, one cheese\r\nfactory, one machine shop, one syrup mill, several stores and shops,\r\none hotel, one school house, one public hall, and one church building\r\nbelonging to the Congregationalists.\r\n\r\nNo intoxicants are sold in the village. The first school was taught in\r\n1859, by Jane Sanford.\r\n\r\nJAMES HILL was born in Hillsborough, New Hampshire, Feb. 15, 1825, and\r\nsettled in Warren, St. Croix county, in 1863, where he engaged in\r\nfarming and dealing in grain. He represented St. Croix county in the\r\nWisconsin assembly of 1878-79-80.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOWN PLATS LOCATED IN ST.

It contains\r\nabout six hundred square miles of territory, lying east of the\r\nMississippi river and Lake St. Croix. It is somewhat triangular in\r\nshape, the river and lake forming the hypotenuse, and St. Croix, Dunn\r\nand Pepin bounding it by right lines on the north and east, Pepin also\r\nforming a small part of its southern boundary.\r\n\r\nThe scenery is picturesque and varied. Along the river and lake is a\r\nseries of limestone bluffs, broken at intervals by ravines and\r\nvalleys, and leaving the impression upon the mind of the traveler on\r\nthe Mississippi of a rough, broken and inhospitable country, than\r\nwhich nothing could be further from the truth. Beyond these rugged\r\nescarpments of limestone and out of sight of the traveler, the country\r\nstretches away toward the interior as an undulating prairie, with\r\nmeadows and rich pasturelands, with occasional forests, the whole\r\nwatered and drained by an intricate network of streams tributary to\r\nthe lake and river, and the three larger streams, the Kinnikinic,\r\nwhich empties into the St. Croix and Big rivers, Trimbelle and Rush,\r\nthat empty into the Mississippi. Some branches of the Chippewa also\r\ntake their rise in this county. These streams uniformly have their\r\nsource in springs and their waters are consequently pure, cold and\r\ninvigorating, flowing over beds of white sand or pebbles, and in their\r\ndownward course forming many ripples, rapids, cascades and some\r\nbeautiful waterfalls. Their total descent to the bed of the\r\nMississippi is about four hundred feet. Pierce county has no inland\r\nlakes within its limits, nor any indications of their previous\r\nexistence. The soil is formed chiefly from decomposed rocks or ledges\r\nworn down by the abrading forces of water and wind, of frost and heat.\r\nThe rivers in their downward course have excavated broad valleys,\r\nhaving originally precipitous bluffs on either side, and even bluffs\r\nonce islands in the midst of the streams. These, by later agencies,\r\nhave been smoothed to gentle slopes and rounded into graceful mounds,\r\ntowering sometimes as much as eighty feet above the valley or plains.\r\nIn some places mere outlines of sandstone or limestone rock are left,\r\nturret-like, on the summit of a mound, as monuments on which the\r\ngeologist may read the record of ages gone. As the character of the\r\nsoil of a country depends upon the composition of the rocks underlying\r\nit, and those removed from the surface, reduced to soil and widely\r\ndistributed, we give what may be considered as the section of any one\r\nof the mounds near Prescott in the order of the superposition of\r\nstrata:\r\n\r\n    At the base--Lower magnesian limestone         250 feet.\r\n    Above the plain--Upper sandstone                50 feet.\r\n    On the summit--Trenton, or shell limestone      30 feet.\r\n\r\nOver a great part of the county the Trenton and limestone are worn\r\nalmost entirely away, and their former existence is attested only by a\r\nfew mounds, bluffs and outlines. Drift is not often met with. The soil\r\nmay be considered as formed out of drift, now removed from its\r\noriginal position, and out of the sandstone and limestone. It is,\r\ntherefore, soil of the richest quality.\r\n\r\nBy the same act that created the county of Pierce, passed March 14,\r\n1853, Prescott was declared the county seat. The town board of\r\nPrescott was constituted the county board. The commissioners were\r\nOsborn Strahl, chairman; Silas Wright and Sylvester Moore. At the\r\nfirst county election, Nov. 15, 1853, one hundred and ten votes were\r\ncast. The following were the officers elected: County judge, W. J.\r\nCopp; sheriff, N. S. Dunbar; treasurer, J. R. Freeman; clerk of court,\r\nS. R. Gunn; clerk of board, Henry Teachout; coroner, J. Olive;\r\ndistrict attorney, P. V. Wise; surveyor, J. True; register of deeds,\r\nJ. M. Whipple. Mr. Whipple was authorized to transcribe the records of\r\nSt. Croix county up to date of the organization of Pierce.\r\n\r\nThe first assessment in the county, in 1853, amounted to $24,452. At\r\nthe meeting of the supervisors, Jan. 18, 1854, the district attorney\r\nwas allowed forty dollars per annum as salary. Courts were held\r\nwherever suitable buildings could be obtained. During this year Judge\r\nWyram Knowlton, of Prairie du Chien, held the first district court at\r\nPrescott. The first records of the court were kept on sheets of\r\nfoolscap paper, and fastened together with wafers. The first case\r\nbefore the court was that of \"The State of Wisconsin, Pierce County,\r\nWm. Woodruff _vs._ Chas. D. Stevens, August Lochmen, and Chas.\r\nPeschke, in Court of said County. In Equity.\" On reading and filing\r\nthe bill in complaint, in this case, on motion of S. J. R. McMillan\r\nand H. M. Lewis, solicitors for counsel, J. S. Foster, it was ordered\r\nthat a writ of injunction be issued in the case, pursuant to the\r\nprayer of said bill, upon said complainant. Some one, in his behalf,\r\nfiled with the clerk of said court, a bond for damages and costs in\r\nthe sum of $1,700, with surety to be approved by the clerk or judge of\r\nsaid court. The first document recorded in the county is an agreement\r\nbetween Philander Prescott and Philip Aldrich, wherein Aldrich agrees\r\nto occupy lands adjoining Prescott's, at the mouth of St. Croix lake\r\non the west, and David Hone on the east. The second document is a\r\ndeed, conveying a tract of three hundred and twenty acres of land from\r\nFrancis Chevalier to Joseph R. Brown, the land lying near the mouth of\r\nLake St. Croix, and marked by stakes planted in the ground, and\r\nadjoining Francis Gamelle's claim, dated July 20, 1840.\r\n\r\nIn 1857 County Treasurer Ayers became a defaulter to the county in the\r\nsum of $2,287.76, and to the Prescott Bank, $4,000. In 1861, by act of\r\nthe legislature, the question of changing the county seat from\r\nPrescott to Ellsworth was submitted to the people. The vote as\r\ndeclared was six hundred for removal and three hundred and\r\nseventy-three against it. Technical objections having been raised as\r\nto the legality of the vote, the subject was submitted to the people a\r\nsecond time in 1862. The vote for removal was confirmed. In 1863 the\r\ndistrict system was adopted and three districts were established by\r\nlegislative enactment, but in 1870 the county returned to the original\r\nsystem by which the board of supervisors was made to consist of a\r\nchairman from each one of the town boards. A poor farm was established\r\nnear Ellsworth in 1869, at a cost of $3,600. The county board also\r\nappropriated $31,000 for county buildings at Ellsworth.\r\n\r\nThe finances of the county have been admirably managed. In 1885 there\r\nwas no indebtedness, and a surplus in the treasury of $5,000. The\r\neducational interests are well cared for. There are over one hundred\r\nschool districts in the county, with well conducted schools, and\r\ngenerally with good substantial buildings. The school lands of St.\r\nCroix, then including Pierce county, were appraised in 1852 by Dr.\r\nOtis Hoyt, ---- Denniston and James Bailey, and the lands at once\r\noffered for sale. Settlers' rights were respected. The county issued\r\n$5,000 in bonds to aid in establishing the normal school at River\r\nFalls.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAILROADS.\r\n\r\nRiver Falls has direct communication with Hudson by a branch of the\r\nChicago & St. Paul railroad. In 1885 the Burlington & Northern\r\nrailroad route was surveyed and established, entering the county on\r\nthe shore of Lake Pepin, and running nearly parallel with lake and\r\nriver to Prescott, where it crosses Lake St. Croix near its mouth, on\r\na bridge, the total length of which is 520.5 feet, with one draw span\r\n367.5 feet in length, and one piled span of 153 feet. This bridge was\r\ncompleted, and the first train entered Prescott, May 31, 1886. The\r\ngrade of this road does not exceed fifteen feet to the mile.\r\n\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS STATISTICS.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Army of the Republic have posts at the following places:\r\n\r\n    No. 72, A.

The surface is somewhat broken where\r\ntraversed by the Kinnikinic and its tributaries. It includes\r\ntwenty-four sections on the west side of township 27, range 19, and\r\nfractional township 27, range 20. It was established in 1855. Its\r\nfirst board of officers were: Supervisors--Geo. W. McMurphy, chairman;\r\nOsborne Strahl and G. W. Teachout. C. B. Cox was the first postmaster,\r\nin 1852, at a place called Clifton Mills, from which the town\r\nafterward derived its name. This post town is situated on the\r\nKinnikinic, in section 18, township 27, range 18 west. It has one\r\ngrist mill and two saw mills, belonging to Cox, King & Goodsall. No\r\nintoxicants are sold here. The Glenwood saw mills, having a capacity\r\nof 3,000,000 feet, are located on the lake shore. In 1868 a limestone\r\nquarry was opened on the lake shore, by Oakley & Nichols. In 1881 the\r\nfirm became Oakley & Hall. They have a patent kiln and good machinery,\r\nand some seasons have manufactured as much as 5,000 barrels of lime.\r\n\r\nGEORGE W. MCMURPHY was born at Newcastle, Delaware, in 1821. In 1845\r\nhe came to St. Croix Falls, and in 1848 to Clifton, where he\r\npre-empted the beautiful homestead which he still holds, and where he\r\nhas successfully followed the business of farming. He has been\r\nrepeatedly elected to town and county offices. In 1848 he was married\r\nto Maria A. Rice. Their children are Augustus (resident of St. Paul),\r\nGeorge (a physician living in Ortonville, Minnesota), James A.,\r\nRobert, Albert and Edward, and two married daughters. Mr. McMurphy is\r\na member of the Congregational church.\r\n\r\nOSBORNE STRAHL was born in Belmont county, Ohio, in 1818; came to\r\nGalena, Illinois, in 1838, in 1845 to Mauston and Stevens Point,\r\nWisconsin, and to Chippewa Falls in 1847. During these years he\r\nfollowed lumbering. In 1850 he came to the town of Elisabeth, St.\r\nCroix county, which on subsequent division of towns and counties left\r\nMr. Strahl in Clifton, where he has been engaged in farming. He was\r\nmarried in 1860 to Rebecca McDonald. They have two sons, Wm. Day,\r\nliving in Dakota, Howard P., in River Falls; three daughters, Mabel,\r\nwife of Joseph M. Smith, banker at River Falls, and two daughters\r\nunmarried. Mr. Strahl filled various town and county offices.\r\n\r\nCHARLES B. COX was born June 25, 1810, in Chenango county, New York.\r\nHe learned the trade of a miller, lived in Ohio seventeen years and\r\ncame to Clifton in 1849. He built at Clifton the first saw and grist\r\nmill in the Kinnikinic valley, in 1850. He changed his residence to\r\nRiver Falls in 1854, where he lived till 1874, when he removed to\r\nCalifornia. During the year 1851 he ground three hundred bushels of\r\nwheat, the sole product of the valley.\r\n\r\nEPHRAIM HARNSBERGER was born in Kentucky, Nov. 21, 1824, moved with\r\nhis parents to Illinois in 1832, and to Prescott in 1847, where he\r\npre-empted a homestead of one hundred and sixty acres. He was married\r\nat Alton, Illinois, in 1858, to Lizzie Johnson. Their children are\r\nCharles, Sarah Etta, and Jennie.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIAMOND BLUFF\r\n\r\nIs a triangular shaped town, the hypotenuse being formed by the\r\nMississippi river. It contains ten sections and three fractional\r\nsections in town 25, range 18, and five sections and five fractional\r\nsections in town 25, range 19. It is traversed in the eastern part by\r\nTrimbelle river. The town was established in 1857, and the first town\r\nmeeting was held that year at the home of David Comstock. The town\r\nboard consisted of: Supervisors--James Akers, chairman; Wilson Thing\r\nand C. F. Hoyt; justice, S. Hunter. Susan Rogers taught the first\r\nschool. This town has the honor of claiming the first white settler,\r\naside from traders, in the Upper Mississippi valley. He came to the\r\nsite of the present village of Diamond Bluff in 1800, and named it\r\nMonte Diamond. We give elsewhere a somewhat extended account of this\r\nancient pioneer, with some speculations concerning him and his\r\ndescendants that are plausible enough to warrant their insertion. In\r\nhistoric times a post office was established here in 1854, called at\r\nthe time, Hoytstown, from C.F. Hoyt, the first postmaster.\r\n\r\nOn the organization of the town the name was changed to Diamond Bluff.\r\nQuite a village has since grown up around it. The first frame house\r\nwas built in 1855, by Enoch Quinby. The first sermon was preached by\r\nRev. J. W. Hancock, a Presbyterian minister, for some years a\r\nmissionary among the Indians. The first birth was that of Mary Day, in\r\n1851, and the first death that of Daniel Crappers, in 1854.\r\n\r\nCAPT. JOHN PAINE.--Jack Paine, as he is familiarly called, was born in\r\nEngland, and for the greater part of his life has been a seafaring\r\nman. For the past thirty years he has been a steamboat man on the\r\nOhio, Mississippi and Missouri rivers. He has been married three\r\ntimes: first in Rhode Island, second to Mrs. La Blond, of St. Louis,\r\nand last to Miss Ressue, of Diamond Bluff. He came to Diamond Bluff in\r\n1848, with four children of his first wife, his second wife having\r\ndied childless. He is now living with his third wife in La Crosse.\r\nThey have three children.\r\n\r\nJOHN DAY was born in Martinsburg, Virginia. In 1850 he and his wife\r\nand three children, with Allen B. Wilson and his wife, came to Diamond\r\nBluff. Mr. Day is well known as a fearless and enthusiastic hunter. In\r\n1852 he had a close encounter with a large black bear, which, after a\r\ndesperate struggle, he killed with an axe. The Indians considered Mr.\r\nDay as \"waukon,\" supernatural, averring that their bravest warriors\r\nwould not have attacked singly so large an animal.\r\n\r\nSARAH A. VANCE, the wife of Mr. Day, was born in Kentucky. The Vance\r\nfamily were famous pioneers, and some of them were noted Methodist\r\npreachers. Miss Vance's first marriage was to John R. Shores, by whom\r\nshe had two children, one of whom, Isabella, became the wife of A. R.\r\nWilson.\r\n\r\nALLEN R. WILSON.--Mr. Wilson was born in Kentucky; spent his early\r\nboyhood in Shawneetown, Illinois; was married to Miss Shores at\r\nPotosi, Wisconsin, April 16, 1848, and in 1850 came to Diamond Bluff.\r\nMr. Wilson took great interest in politics, was an ardent Republican,\r\nand was among the first to volunteer his services for the suppression\r\nof the Rebellion in 1861. He enlisted in Company B, Sixth Regiment,\r\nWisconsin Volunteers, and fell in battle, Sept. 14, 1862, at South\r\nMountain. Mr. Wilson was well informed, a close observer of political\r\nevents at home and abroad, and was a brave and efficient soldier. He\r\nleft five children.\r\n\r\nE. S. COULTER.--Mr. Coulter is a Virginian by birth. In early manhood\r\nhe traveled extensively as a book agent, and finally settled at\r\nDiamond Bluff, where he successfully engaged in farming and dealing in\r\nwheat and merchandise.\r\n\r\nJAMES BAMBER, ex-musician in the British and United States armies.\r\n\r\nJACOB MEAD, ex-shoemaker, ex-soldier and miner, a man of superior\r\nnatural and acquired talent.\r\n\r\nCHARLES WALBRIDGE came to Diamond Bluff in 1852.\r\n\r\nJACOB MEAD died in 1884, leaving a large property.\r\n\r\nCHARLES F. HOYT, with his wife and one child, came to Diamond Bluff\r\nfrom Illinois, in 1853.\r\n\r\nENOCH QUINBY was born at Sandwich, New Hampshire; was married to\r\nMatilda Leighton, originally from Athens, Maine. Mr. Quinby and his\r\nwife came from Pittsfield, Illinois, to Diamond Bluff in 1854.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST SETTLER.\r\n\r\nThere is a pretty well grounded tradition that the first white man who\r\nfound his way to Diamond Bluff was a French Vendean loyalist of the\r\narmy of Jacques Cathelineau; that he fled from France in 1793 or 1794,\r\nlanded at Quebec, and was traced by his enemies to Mackinaw and\r\nChicago, where they lost his trail. He came to Diamond Bluff in 1800,\r\nand named it \"Monte Diamond.\" He had for his housekeeper the daughter\r\nof an Indian chief. He died here about 1824. After his death the\r\nIndians always called the place the \"Old White Man's Prairie.\" E.\r\nQuinby, of Diamond Bluff, to whom we are indebted for this account,\r\nadds: \"All the additional evidence I can give in regard to this\r\npioneer is that prior to 1793 his wife died, leaving him one daughter,\r\nwho was deformed. A former friend of his had a beautiful daughter of\r\nabout the same age of his own. After the uprising and defeat of the\r\nVendeans, they became enemies, and he, to save his life, took his\r\nformer friend's daughter, instead of his own, and fled to this\r\ncountry. The father pursued them as far as Chicago, where he saw his\r\ndaughter in company with some Indian girls, and having on her person\r\nsome ornaments once worn by her mother. He at once seized her and\r\ncarried her back with him to France, and the old Frenchman found his\r\nway to Diamond Bluff.\" Faribault's son,[C] now living somewhere in\r\nMinnesota, wrote me a few years since, inquiring about the old\r\nFrenchman, saying that his grandmother claimed that her husband was a\r\nFrench nobleman, and that he lived near Lake Pepin. He believed the\r\nold Frenchman was his grandfather. The above statements were\r\ncommunicated to the late Capt. Orin Smith, of Galena, Illinois, Allen\r\nB. Wilson and myself, in 1854, or in 1855, by an old Frenchman then\r\nresiding at Potosi, Wisconsin, who claimed to have seen and gathered\r\nthese facts from the old man himself. Capt. Smith was well acquainted\r\nwith the Frenchman at Potosi, and gave the fullest credence to his\r\naccount.\r\n\r\n\r\nEL PASO\r\n\r\nOccupies township 26, range 16. It is drained chiefly by Rush river\r\nand its tributary, Lost creek, on the west. The two post villages in\r\nthis town are, El Paso, located in section 5, and Lost Creek, in\r\nsection 3. George P. Walker was the first settler. He built the first\r\nhouse and raised the first crop; Thomas T. Magee came in 1855. In 1860\r\nthe town was organized, Thomas Hurley and Geo. P. Walker being\r\nsupervisors. In 1862 Mr. Magee built a saw and flour mill in section\r\n5, and platted the village of El Paso. In 1875 he removed to Clear\r\nLake, Polk county, of which town he was the first settler. Clara\r\nGreen taught the first school in El Paso, in 1861. There is one\r\nCatholic and one Lutheran church in the village. The name El Paso\r\nsignifying a crossing, is of somewhat obscure derivation.\r\n\r\n\r\nELLSWORTH\r\n\r\nWas organized under the name of Perry, March 3, 1857, but in 1862 it\r\nreceived its present name. It occupies a central position in the\r\ncounty and includes township 26, range 17. This is a rich farming\r\ntown, originally timbered with hardwood. The surface is elevated and\r\ngently undulating. It is drained on the east by the tributaries of\r\nRush river, but has no large or important streams. The first\r\nsupervisors were: P. M. Simons, chairman; Caleb Bruce and Wilson\r\nKinnie. The first settler was Anthony Huddleston, who came April 23,\r\n1856, and pre-empted the southeast quarter of section 20. On November\r\n26th, of the same year, came Caleb, Elihu W. and Eli T. Bruce, who\r\npre-empted farms on sections 18 and 19. During the same year Wilson\r\nand Norris Kinnie and David Klingensmith pre-empted farms in sections\r\n18 and 19. Lilly, Miscen, Russ, and Campbell came also in 1855. The\r\nfirst log house in the town was built by Anthony Huddleston in 1855.\r\nNorris Kinnie built the first in what was afterward the village of\r\nEllsworth. The first school house, a log building, built was in 1857,\r\nand Mary Filkins, now Mrs. G. H. Sargeant, of Minnesota, taught the\r\nfirst school. The first marriage was that of Charles Stannard and Mary\r\nLeonard, in 1855. The first birth, that of the twin children of\r\nWilson. Both died. The first death of an adult was that of Mrs. Jacob\r\nYoungman in the winter of 1855. The post office was opened in 1860,\r\nwith Seely Strickland as postmaster.\r\n\r\n\r\nELLSWORTH VILLAGE.\r\n\r\nThe original owners of the southern half of section 18, and the\r\nnorthern half of 19, Norris Kinnie, Eli T. Bruce, Henry P. Ames, and\r\nWm. Crippin laid out and platted the village of Ellsworth in 1862. Wm.\r\nCrippin, built a frame hotel there in 1860. C. S. Dunbar opened a\r\nstore in 1861. The prospect of Ellsworth becoming the county seat gave\r\na great impetus to business enterprises. This was decided by a popular\r\nvote in 1861, but owing to some technical defects was resubmitted to\r\nthe people of the county in 1862, and then definitely decided. In the\r\nyear 1862 the citizens of Ellsworth built a log house in which the\r\nfirst terms of court were held; meanwhile the county officers had\r\ntheir offices in the basement of Crippin's hotel. The permanent county\r\nbuildings were not erected until 1869. They are built of stone and\r\ncost $60,000. In 1863 a frame schoolhouse took the place of the old\r\nlog structure, and in 1874 a commodious brick building was erected, at\r\na cost of $5,000.\r\n\r\nThe Methodists, Lutherans and Catholics have church buildings. There\r\nis one newspaper, the _Pierce County Herald_, edited by E. F. Case and\r\nE. S. Doolittle. The Barnes saw mill built in 1867, burned down and\r\nrebuilt, has a capacity of about 5,000 feet per day. A branch\r\nrailroad, built from Hudson to River Falls, was extended to Ellsworth\r\nin 1885. The depot is one mile from the village. The Pierce County\r\nCentral fair grounds, containing seventeen acres, are located near the\r\nvillage. The grounds are inclosed and are covered with a fine maple\r\ngrove, in the midst of which is a large flowing spring. D. W.\r\nWoodworth was first president of the fair association. Ellsworth has\r\ntwo handsome cemeteries, Maplewood and the Catholic.\r\n\r\nThe village itself is beautifully situated on an elevated plateau\r\noriginally covered with hardwood timber. The streets are tastefully\r\nadorned with maple trees.\r\n\r\nANTHONY HUDDLESTON.--Mr. Huddleston is of Irish descent. He was born\r\nin West Virginia in 1804; had but limited educational privileges;\r\nlived for a part of his life in Ohio and Indiana, and settled in\r\nEllsworth in 1855, being the first settler in the town. He was a house\r\ncarpenter for over sixty years. He was a member of the Dunkard church\r\nsixty-two years. He was married in 1826, in Ripley, Indiana, to\r\nSusannah Whetstone. They have three sons and six daughters living.\r\n\r\nPERRY D. PIERCE was born in Harpersfield, Delaware county, New York.\r\nHe traces his lineage to ancestors who came across in the Mayflower\r\nand landed at Plymouth Rock. He received an academic education,\r\nstudied law with A. Reckor, Oswego, New York, and was admitted to\r\npractice at Cooperstown in 1843, practiced in Albany three years, and\r\nin 1854 came to the St. Croix valley, locating first at Prescott,\r\nwhere he served as district attorney for four years, and county judge\r\neight years. He was married in 1860, to Lua E. Searsdall. He is now a\r\nresident of Ellsworth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Very Respectfully Hans B. Warner_]\r\n\r\nHANS B.

Forgenbakke are among the\r\noldest citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\nHARTLAND.\r\n\r\nHartland occupies township 25, range 17. It has one post village,\r\nEsdaile. It has one saw mill and a factory for the manufacture of hubs\r\nand bent wood work, operated by Charles Betcher, of Red Wing,\r\nMinnesota, which gives employment to seventy-five men and ten teams\r\nthe year round. The village of Esdaile has also two general\r\nmerchandise stores and a hotel. Hartland was organized in 1859. The\r\nfirst supervisors were A. Harris, chairman; Joseph Sleeper and R. M.\r\nSproul. Amongst the first settlers were Augustus E. Hodgman, section\r\n24, 1854; James Buckingham, section 28, 1854; Lewis Buckmaster,\r\nsection 1, 1853.

The\r\nGood Templars have an organization.\r\n\r\n\r\nISABELLE.\r\n\r\nIsabelle consists of the two upper tiers of section 7, township 24,\r\nrange 17, the lower tier being much broken in outline by Lake Pepin on\r\nthe south. It contains also fractions of sections in the third tier.\r\nBay City, on the shore of the lake, is the postal town. It was\r\norganized in 1855. In 1869 it was annexed to Hartland, but in 1871 it\r\nwas re-established. The first chairman of supervisors was John\r\nBuckingham. The election was held at the house of Abner Brown. Charles\r\nR. Tyler and Lorenzo D. Philips settled here in 1854, and built a saw\r\nmill where now stands the thriving village of Bay City. Saratoga plat\r\nwas laid out upon this ground in 1856, by A. C. Morton. A. J. Dexter\r\nwas the original claimant of the land. Mr. Morton purchased the land\r\nwhich covered a part of Bay City from the government. A surveyor named\r\nMarkle was employed by Morton to run the lines, which Mr. Dexter\r\nconsidered an intrusion upon his rights, and he shot Markle. Dexter\r\nwas tried before Judge S. S. N. Fuller, in 1855, was convicted, and\r\nsentenced to prison for life. After a few years he was pardoned by\r\nGov. Barstow.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAIDEN ROCK.\r\n\r\nMaiden Rock occupies the four upper tiers of sections of township 24,\r\nranges 15 and 16, except such portions on the southwestern corner as\r\nare cut off by Lake Pepin. It contains about forty sections. The town\r\nwas organized under the name of Spring Valley, in 1857. Its postal\r\nvillages are Maiden Rock, on the lake shore, section 15, range 15, and\r\nWarren, also on the lake shore, section 7, range 15. The site of\r\nMaiden Rock village was purchased from the government in 1853, by\r\nAlbert Harris and J. D. Trumbull. In 1855 they erected the first\r\nhouse, and in 1856 built a saw and shingle mill. J. D. Trumbull\r\nplatted the village in 1857, and christened it Maiden Rock, from the\r\ncelebrated rock of that name a few miles further down the lake. Among\r\nthe first settlers in the village were J. H. Steel, J. D. Brown, John\r\nFoster, and Joseph B. Hull.\r\n\r\nThe first hotel was run by G. R. Barton, in a house built by J. D.\r\nTrumbull.

James Gurley, a Methodist preacher from\r\nNorth Pepin.\r\n\r\nA post office was established in 1856, of which J. D. Trumbull was\r\npostmaster. The receipts the first year were eleven dollars, the\r\nexpenses, fifty dollars, paid by the postmaster. The town of Maiden\r\nRock has six school houses, one saw and one grist mill.\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER L. TAYLOR was born in Oneida county, New York, in 1829;\r\ncame to Chicago at an early day, and to Maiden Rock in 1868, where he\r\nengaged in manufacturing. He served as county supervisor for eight\r\nyears, and as member of the Wisconsin legislature in 1876. He removed\r\nto St. Paul in 1880, where he still resides. He is a dealer in real\r\nestate.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARTELL.\r\n\r\nMartell occupies township 27, range 17. Joseph Martell, John Dee,\r\nLouis Lepau and Xerxes Jock, Frenchmen, were the first settlers. They\r\nlocated here in 1847, and remained till 1860, when they moved further\r\nwest, allured by the attractions of frontier life. Martell was\r\norganized in 1854, with the following supervisors: Amos Bonesteel,\r\nchairman; M. Statten and R.J. Thompson. The first school was taught in\r\n1857, by W. Bewel. Martell is the postal village. The first postmaster\r\nwas O. Rasmunson. There are two evangelical Lutheran churches in the\r\ntown, built at a cost of $3,500 and $5,000.

HARNSBERGER was born in Kentucky, April 18, 1822, and moved\r\nwith his parents to Illinois, where he lived nine years. He came to\r\nPrescott in 1846, and pre-empted a farm in Oak Grove, where he has\r\nsince continuously resided. He has filled many public positions\r\ncreditably. He was married to Annie Jeffreys, of Illinois, in 1860.\r\nTheir sons are Ephraim, Lewis and John.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESCOTT CITY\r\n\r\nIs beautifully located at the junction of the St. Croix and\r\nMississippi rivers. The business portion of the city is on a terrace\r\nat the base of the bluff, and between it and the river and lake. The\r\npublic buildings, churches, school house and residences are chiefly on\r\nthe upper terrace, or bluff, and command an extensive view of the\r\nvalley of the two rivers, the whole forming a landscape of unrivaled\r\nbeauty. The advantages of the position are by no means limited to its\r\npicturesque surroundings. Prescott, from its position at the junction\r\nof the two rivers, was early recognized as an important point for the\r\nreshipping of freight and re-embarkation of passengers. The St.\r\nCroix, which comes in from the north, rises within a few miles of Lake\r\nSuperior, and after running a course of two hundred miles, empties its\r\nwaters into Lake St. Croix, twenty-four miles above its outlet. The\r\nlake is navigable at all times to Stillwater and to Taylor's Falls at\r\nthe Dalles. The Mississippi comes in from the northwest, and is\r\nnavigable to St. Paul, a distance of thirty miles. The two channels at\r\nthe junction are each about 1,000 feet wide, with an average depth of\r\nfifteen feet, and the banks slope to the water's edge, or stand in\r\nsome places in vertical ledges, thus forming a natural quay along the\r\nentire front of the city. The quay, or landing, is semicircular in\r\nshape, the upper terrace, or bench, about one hundred feet in height,\r\nis likewise semicircular, the convexity being toward the river and\r\nlake. The crest of the terrace is worn down by the rains into ravines,\r\nleaving rounded points, or promontories, on the summit of which the\r\nancient mound builders have left traces of their peculiar art. The\r\nfirst settlement of Prescott was made by Philander Prescott, Col.\r\nThompson, Dr. Emerson, and Capt. Scott, the three last named being\r\narmy officers at Fort Snelling. Mr. Prescott, acting as agent for the\r\nothers, made the claim in 1836, remaining three years to hold it, when\r\nit was left in the care of Joseph Mosier until 1851.\r\n\r\nIn 1837 seven acres were broken and fenced, constituting the entire\r\nlanded improvements within the present bounds of Pierce county. In\r\n1849 one hundred and fifty acres were improved. Geo. Schaser and H.\r\nDoe were the first resident farmers. From 1838 to 1849 a trading post\r\nfor Indian supplies was kept by persons holding the claim. W. S.\r\nLockwood opened a store in 1842, and other improvements were made. As\r\nthe army officers were called to other fields of labor, Mr. Prescott\r\nsoon found himself in sole possession of the original claim, he\r\npurchasing their interests, and in 1849, when the lands had been\r\nsurveyed by the government, he entered sixty-one acres. In 1853 Dr. O.\r\nT. Maxon and W. J. Copp purchased a greater part of the town site and\r\nsurveyed and platted it as the city of Prescott. A charter was\r\nobtained in 1857. A post office had been established here in 1840,\r\ncalled the \"Mouth of St. Croix,\" but it was removed across the lake\r\nand named Point Douglas. The post office was re-established at\r\nPrescott in 1852. Dr. O. T. Maxon was first postmaster. The number of\r\npersons who came that year to Prescott is estimated at about one\r\nhundred and fifty.[D] Mr. Schaser platted an addition to the city of\r\nsixty-one acres in 1855. When the city received its charter the\r\nfollowing officers were elected: Mayor, J. R. Freeman; aldermen, First\r\nward, N. S. Dunbar, Thomas Dickerson and Seth Ticknor; Second ward,\r\nHilton Doe, George W. Oakley, N. A. Miller; president of the council,\r\nSeth Ticknor; justices of the peace, I. T. Foster, O. Edwards; city\r\nattorney, P. V. Wise; city surveyor, Wm. Howes; superintendent of\r\nschools, Thomas Dickerson.\r\n\r\nWm. Schaser built the first frame house, and Mrs. Wm. Schaser was the\r\nfirst white woman. Their daughter Eliza was the first white child born\r\nin the new settlement. The first marriage was that of G. W. McMurphy\r\nto a daughter of Mr. Rice, April 24, 1848. The first death was that of\r\nW. S. Lockwood, in 1847.\r\n\r\nWhen the county of Pierce was organized Prescott was designated as the\r\ncounty seat, and so remained until 1862, when, by popular election,\r\nEllsworth was chosen.\r\n\r\nIn 1856 Messrs. Silverthorn & Dudley started a saw mill, which they\r\noperated until 1861, when Mr. Dudley purchased his partner's interest,\r\nand erected a flouring and saw mill.\r\n\r\nA wagon and carriage manufactory was established by F. Menicke, in\r\n1862, the Prescott brewery in 1866, by N. P. Husting, and the Prescott\r\nmachine shops in 1876, by H. B. Failing. The City Bank of Prescott was\r\norganized in 1858, Charles Miller, president; W. P. Westfall, cashier;\r\ncapital stock, $50,000. It closed in 1862. The National Bank was\r\nestablished in 1877, by W. S. Miller. The first school in Pierce\r\ncounty was taught by a missionary named Denton, at Prescott, in 1843.\r\nIn 1851 Miss Oliver taught a private school. In 1853 the first\r\ndistrict school was established. The school board were: Directors, M.\r\nCraig, George W. McMurphy; treasurer, N. S. Dunbar; clerk, Dr. O. T.\r\nMaxon; teacher, Miss Matthews. The first school house was built in\r\n1854. A building for a graded school was erected in 1859. A high\r\nschool building was erected in 1847, at a cost of $20,000.\r\n\r\nThe first religious society was that of the Methodists, organized in\r\n1853, under the labors of Rev. Norris Hobart. Their first building\r\nwas erected in 1856. Its dimensions were 20 × 32 feet, ground plan. In\r\n1868 they erected a building 40 × 70 feet, ground plan, at a cost of\r\n$4,000.\r\n\r\nIn 1854 the Baptist church was organized by Rev. E. W. Cressy.\r\n\r\nIn 1854 the Congregationalists organized, with Rev. P. Hall as pastor,\r\nand in 1855 built a brick church, 40 × 50 feet, ground plan.\r\n\r\nIn 1855 the Presbyterians organized, and in 1866 built a church.\r\n\r\nThe Lutheran church was organized in 1865, by Rev. C. Thayer.\r\n\r\nUnder the preaching of Rev. M. Guild the Episcopal church was\r\norganized in 1872. Previous to this date Revs. Breck, Wilcoxson and\r\nPeabody had labored from time to time. The Catholic church was\r\norganized by Rev. Father Vervais in 1860. In 1868 a church edifice was\r\nbuilt.\r\n\r\nThe following social and benevolent orders have organizations in\r\nPrescott:\r\n\r\nNorthwestern Lodge, A. F. and A.

Fairs are held annually. Pine Glen cemetery is situated on\r\nthe bluff half a mile below the city. It was established in 1856.\r\nNature has done much for the site. The view of the Mississippi valley\r\nis unobstructed for a distance of from twelve to twenty miles on the\r\nsouth, and to the bend of the river bluffs above Hastings. The grounds\r\nare handsomely laid out and adorned with shrubbery.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESTRUCTIVE FIRES.\r\n\r\nPrescott has suffered severely from fires.

Total loss, nearly $75,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIOGRAPHICAL.\r\n\r\nPHILANDER PRESCOTT was born in 1801, at Phelpstown, Ontario county,\r\nNew York. Late in the year 1819 he came to Fort Snelling and remained\r\nthere, or in the vicinity, the greater part of his life. From his\r\nconstant association with the Indians, especially with the Sioux, he\r\nlearned to speak their language. He was also related to them by his\r\nmarriage with a Sioux woman. This fact, added to his influence among\r\nthem, and being a man not only of a high character for integrity, but\r\nwell educated and intelligent, he was able to render the officers of\r\nthe Fort much service. He made a translation into the Sioux dialect of\r\na number of English and French hymns for the use of the mission\r\nschools near Prescott. He gave his children an English education. In\r\n1835, while acting as Indian interpreter, he came to the present site\r\nof Prescott, and in conjunction with several officers of the Fort, he\r\nacting as their agent, laid claim to considerable territory, and made\r\nsome improvements in the shape of log buildings. When the army\r\nofficers were sent to other posts, Mr. Prescott purchased their\r\ninterests and held the claim. In 1849, after the government survey, he\r\npre-empted sixty-one acres and laid out what he called the city of\r\nPrescott. He resided here and at the Fort alternately until his death,\r\nwhich occurred in 1862. He had been sent by the government on a peace\r\nmission to the Indians in rebellion, met them at a point near Mankato,\r\nand was cruelly assassinated by those to whom he had ever proven a\r\ntrue friend, and whom he had every reason to suppose friendly to him.\r\n\r\nGEORGE SCHASER is a native of Austria, and came to the mouth of the\r\nSt. Croix in 1841. In 1842 he returned to St. Louis and married\r\nChristine Bucher. Mrs. Schaser was the first white woman resident in\r\nPrescott. Mr. Schaser built the first frame house in the settlement,\r\nin 1844. This house was regarded for many years as the finest house\r\nbetween Prairie du Chien and St. Paul. In 1855 Mr. Schaser surveyed an\r\naddition to Prescott on land he had pre-empted in 1849. In 1858 he\r\nbuilt the brick hotel known as the St. Nicholas. Mr. Schaser died May\r\n3, 1884, leaving a widow, three sons and one daughter. His sons are\r\nHenry, Edward and George A. His daughter Emma was married to Capt.\r\nJohn E. Ball (deceased 1881). An older daughter, Eliza, the first\r\nchild born in Pierce county, was married to E. W. Haviland, and died\r\nin 1880, near New Orleans.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM S. LOCKWOOD, a native of New York State, came to Prairie du\r\nChien in 1833, and to Prescott in 1842. The year following his family\r\nfollowed. Mr. Lockwood died in 1847. His widow, Georgiana Barton, was\r\nmarried to Orange B. Walker, of Marine Mills, and died at Marine, Oct.\r\n9, 1885.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE BAILEY was born in 1824, in Sullivan county, New York,\r\nwhere his youthful days were passed. He came to Prescott in 1849,\r\nwhere he has since been engaged in farming, mercantile and real estate\r\nbusiness. He was married in 1856, in Prescott, to Nettie Crippin. They\r\nhave one son, Victor, and two daughters, Myrtle, wife of E. L.\r\nMeacham, of Prescott, and Jessamine. Mr. Bailey has a very pleasant\r\nhome in Prescott. He has filled various offices, among them that of\r\ntreasurer and clerk of St. Croix county, prior to the organization of\r\nPierce.\r\n\r\nADOLPH WERKMAN was born in Germany in 1826; came to America in 1847,\r\nand to Prescott in 1848. He was married at Prescott in 1856.\r\n\r\nJOSEPH MANESE (alias Joseph Abear) was of French extraction and a\r\nnative of Lower Canada. While yet a youth he came into the Lake\r\nSuperior region, where he was employed most of his time in hunting and\r\ntrapping by the fur companies. His history, if written in full, would\r\nabound in stirring incidents and adventures. He was a man of unusual\r\nstrength and activity, and in disposition light hearted, vivacious and\r\ngay even to hilarity. He died in Prescott in 1884.\r\n\r\nHILTON DOE was a native of New York State, and came to Red Wing, as\r\nIndian farmer, about 1840. He settled in Prescott in 1844, in sections\r\n9 and 10, pre-emptions subsequently surveyed into town lots. Mr. Doe\r\nmarried Miss Daily, in Illinois, in 1844. Mrs. Doe died in 1860, Mr.\r\nDoe in 1884.\r\n\r\nLUTE A. TAYLOR, a young man of decided talent, a good classical\r\nscholar, a brilliant writer and humorist, came to River Falls in 1856,\r\nand in 1857, with his brother Horace, established the River Falls\r\n_Journal_, which they continued to publish jointly for three years,\r\nwhen Horace removed to Hudson and established the _Times_. Lute A.\r\nremoved to Prescott, taking with him the material of the _Journal_\r\noffice, and established the Prescott _Journal_, which he edited and\r\npublished until 1869, when he removed to La Crosse and published the\r\nLa Crosse _Leader_ until his death, which occurred in 1872.\r\n\r\nMr. Taylor was a correspondent of various papers and an entertaining\r\nlecturer. As a conversationalist and wit, he was without a rival. A\r\nslight impediment in his speech, if anything, added to the humorous\r\neffect of his pithy sayings. He is well remembered in the valley of\r\nthe St. Croix. A volume containing his biography and some\r\ncharacteristic sketches has been published since his death.\r\n\r\nJOHN HUITT, a Canadian, came to Prescott in 1847, and erected the\r\nfirst blacksmith shop in the village. He was married in Prescott to a\r\ndaughter of Joseph Mosier, and subsequently pre-empted a quarter\r\nsection of land on Prescott prairie. He built a saw and planing mill\r\non Trimbelle river. He died at Trimbelle in 1873.\r\n\r\nJOHN M. RICE was born in Sudbury, Massachusetts, in 1805; was married\r\nin 1828, in Massachusetts, to Mary A. Goodenough; came in 1837 to\r\nMarine, Illinois, and in 1847 to Prescott. Mr. Rice was a house\r\ncarpenter, but followed also the business of farming. He was an\r\nupright man and a member of the Congregational church. He died in\r\n1878, leaving one son, David O., living in Prescott; a daughter, Maria\r\nA., wife of G. W. McMurphy, of Prescott, and a daughter in Illinois.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN INDIAN BATTLE.\r\n\r\nThe feud between the Sioux and Chippewas originated in prehistoric\r\ntimes and from causes not now known. It has been a tribal vendetta,\r\ncontinuous and relentless, with the advantages in favor of the\r\nChippewas, who, in the course of time, have steadily forced the Sioux\r\nwestward from the Sault Ste. Marie to the Mississippi at Prescott. We\r\ngive the following account of one of their battles, being an Indian\r\nversion, translated and written out by Philander Prescott. This fight\r\noccurred in 1711, on the site of the city of Prescott. As the Indians\r\nhad been supplied by the French with firearms as early as 1700, there\r\nis nothing improbable in their alleged use on this occasion. But for\r\nthe story:\r\n\r\n     \"The Chippewas, a thousand strong, attacked a camp of\r\n     eighteen Sioux lodges by night and killed most of the\r\n     warriors. The women and children fled to the canoes, and,\r\n     jumping in, pushed from the shore, but, in their hurry,\r\n     without paddles. A large eddy in the river carried the\r\n     canoes round and round, and, as they swept near the shore,\r\n     the Chippewas seized them, pulled them to the shore and\r\n     butchered the women and children. A few Sioux warriors had\r\n     fled up the bank of the lake, where they hid in crevices and\r\n     caves of the rocks. The Chippewas discovered their hiding\r\n     places and killed all but one, who rushed from his retreat,\r\n     and, diving again and again in the lake, swam for the\r\n     opposite shore. As often as his head appeared above the\r\n     water the Chippewas fired a volley of bullets, which fell\r\n     around like hail, but harmlessly. The bold swimmer finally\r\n     reached the opposite shore unharmed, when he gave a whoop of\r\n     joy and disappeared in the thicket. The Chippewas, filled\r\n     with admiration at his daring exploit, returned his farewell\r\n     whoop with interest.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRIVER FALLS\r\n\r\nOccupies township 27, range 18, and a tier of two sections from range\r\n19. Trimbelle river drains the eastern portion and the Kinnikinic the\r\nnorthwest. Its early history is identified with the history of River\r\nFalls city, its first settlement. It was organized in 1854, as\r\nGreenwood, but in 1858 the name was changed to River Falls. As River\r\nFalls city was not incorporated until 1885, we shall give its early\r\nhistory in connection with that of the town.\r\n\r\nThe first settler was Joel Foster, in the fall of 1848. In 1849, came\r\nD. McGregor, James and Walter Mapes; in 1850, Messrs. Hayes, Tozer,\r\nPenn and Parks, and not long after the Powells and Clark Green. These\r\nearly settlers chose locations at, or near, the present site of River\r\nFalls city, and along the banks of the Kinnikinic, which here, owing\r\nto its numerous waterfalls, offered unusual facilities for milling and\r\nmanufacturing. The first crop was raised by Joel Foster, in 1849. The\r\nfirst saw mill was built in 1851 by the brothers N. N. and O. S.\r\nPowell, just below the site of the present Greenwood mill. This was\r\nburned in 1876. In 1854 the Powell brothers platted the village of\r\nRiver Falls, called at first, Kinnikinic, setting apart for that\r\npurpose two hundred acres of land. This plat included the upper\r\nwaterfalls within the present city limits. The largest water power\r\nthey donated to C. B. Cox as a mill site, to encourage settlement in\r\nthe village. The brothers co-operated in building up the village,\r\namongst other things building a frame store and stocking it with\r\ngoods. This was the first store in the Kinnikinic valley. They dealt\r\nalso in real estate and lumber. The name of River Falls, as applied to\r\nthe village, dates from the establishment of the first post office, in\r\n1854. Charles Hutchinson was the first postmaster, and the office was\r\nheld in this pioneer store. J. S. Rounce, in 1870, built the first\r\nfoundry in Pierce county.\r\n\r\nThe water powers of River Falls have been extensively utilized, many\r\nsaw and flouring mills having been erected at various times on the\r\nKinnikinic. Of these, in 1886, the more notable are, the Junction\r\nmills, owned by Freeman, Rhyder & Co., with a capacity of 400 barrels\r\ndaily, and a barrel manufactory attached, which gives employment to 40\r\nmen and turns off from 300 to 400 barrels daily. The Greenwood mills,\r\nowned by Geo. Fortune & Co., capacity 50 barrels; the Cascade mills,\r\nowned by the Baker estate, capacity 50 barrels; the Prairie mill,\r\nbuilt by C. B. Cox in 1858, and now owned by J. D. Putnam, capacity\r\n150 barrels.\r\n\r\nIn educational matters River Falls has taken and maintained an\r\nadvanced position. The first school house was built in 1854, by seven\r\nmen, at a cost of five hundred dollars. Helen Flint taught the first\r\nschool. In 1856 a joint stock association was incorporated as \"The\r\nRiver Falls Academy.\" A building was erected, 36 × 66 feet, ground\r\nplan, and two stories in height. Prof. Wilcox was the first principal.\r\nThis school was maintained as an academy until 1860, at which time it\r\nwas superseded by the free schools. In the fall of 1879 the building\r\nwas destroyed by fire. Subsequently a commodious brick structure was\r\nerected in its place at a cost of $15,000. Excellent private schools\r\nwere maintained by Hinckley, Cody and Baker, for five years during the\r\n'60s. The State Normal School, of which a more extended account is\r\ngiven elsewhere, was established here, and a building erected in 1874,\r\nat a cost of about $65,000, the people of River Falls and other towns\r\ncontributing to this fund $25,000, with private subscriptions to the\r\namount of $12,000, and a donation of ten acres of land. Of the $25,000\r\nRiver Falls gave $10,000, Troy $4,000, Clifton $3,000, while Pierce\r\ncounty contributed $5,000, and Kinnikinic, St. Croix county, gave\r\n$3,000. The building, a handsome brick, four stories high, including\r\nthe basement, stands on an elevated plat of ground in the southeastern\r\npart of the city. The first board of instruction consisted of W. D.\r\nParker, president, with the following assistants: J. B. Thayer,\r\nconductor of teachers' institute; A. Earthman, history, geography,\r\nmusic; Lucy E. Foot, English literature, reading, spelling; Julia A.\r\nMcFarlan, mathematics; Margaret Hosford, Latin and English literature.\r\nModel department, Ellen C. Jones, teacher, grammar grade; Mary A.\r\nKelley, teacher, intermediate grade; Lizzie J. Curtis, teacher,\r\nprimary grade.\r\n\r\nThe following are the churches of River Falls, with date of\r\nestablishment and name of first pastor when known: Congregational,\r\n1855, Rev. James Stirratt; Baptist, 1857, Rev. A. Gibson; Methodist,\r\n1858; Episcopal, 1871, Rev. Chas. Thorpe; Catholic, 1875, Rev. Father\r\nConnelly; Seventh Day Adventist, 1881.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the last named, these church organizations have\r\ngood buildings. The Congregational church building erected in 1857 was\r\nsuperseded by a building in 1867 that cost $10,000. This was destroyed\r\nby a tornado in 1868, but has since been rebuilt at the cost of the\r\nbuilding destroyed, and a parsonage has been added at a cost of\r\n$2,000.\r\n\r\nA Sunday-school was established in River Falls in 1853, and the first\r\nsermon was preached, in 1850 or 1851, by Rev. Julius S. Webber, a\r\nBaptist missionary. Rev. John Wilcoxson, an Episcopalian, held\r\noccasional services as early as 1859.\r\n\r\n\r\nASSOCIATIONS.\r\n\r\nThe following are the social and benevolent associations of River\r\nFalls, with dates of organization: Masonic Lodge, June, 1859; I. O. O.\r\nF., 1872; I. O. G. T., March 15, 1877; Juvenile Temple of Honor, March\r\n15, 1877; Temple of Honor, March 31, 1878; A. O. U. W., 1878. The\r\nhall, fixtures and charter of the Odd Fellows Lodge was destroyed in\r\nthe fire of 1876, but the lodge was rechartered the same year.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BANK OF RIVER FALLS\r\n\r\nWas organized Jan. 1, 1874. ---- Bartlett, president; Joseph M. Smith,\r\ncashier. Capital, $15,000. It was reorganized in 1883, under state\r\nlaw, R. S. Burhyte, president; W. D. Parker, vice president; J. M.\r\nSmith, cashier. Capital stock, $35,000. Total business in 1885,\r\n$5,770,733.98.\r\n\r\n\r\nHUDSON & RIVER FALLS RAILROAD.\r\n\r\nThis road was built in 1878, the people of River Falls contributing\r\n$60,000 to its construction. The road is ten miles in length. In 1885\r\nit was extended to Ellsworth, a distance of twelve miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nRIVER FALLS BOARD OF TRADE\r\n\r\nWas established in 1884. A. D. Andrews, president; C. H. Keys,\r\nsecretary.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRES.\r\n\r\nIn 1875 the Metropolitan Hotel, costing $15,000, and other buildings\r\nwere burned; loss $30,000. The insurance was light. In 1876 a large\r\nportion of the town was destroyed by fire.\r\n\r\n\r\nRIVER FALLS CITY.\r\n\r\nRiver Falls was incorporated as a city in 1885. At the first election\r\nfor city officers, held April 7th, three hundred and nineteen votes\r\nwere cast, and the following persons were declared duly elected to the\r\npositions named: Mayor, A. A. Andrews; treasurer, G. E. Pratt;\r\nassessor, E. H. Daniel; aldermen, First ward, W. W. Wadsworth; Second\r\nward, L. M. Rosenquist; Third ward, R. N. Jenson; Fourth ward, L.\r\nStyles; marshal, R. N. Bevens; city clerk, Allen H. Weld. The license\r\nfor the sale of intoxicants was fixed at $200. The population of River\r\nFalls in 1886 was 1,700. It is a lively, prosperous city, planned on a\r\nliberal scale, with wide streets, well shaded with ornamental trees.\r\nThe mills have reservations by which they are separated from the\r\nbusiness part of the city. The beauty of the original waterfalls is\r\nsomewhat marred by the mills and their debris. Originally they were\r\nvery beautiful and picturesque, and were widely celebrated, and much\r\nvisited by the lovers of Nature. Of these falls there are four, two on\r\nthe south branch, one on the north branch, and one some rods below\r\nthe junction of the two streams. The falls were not noted for their\r\ngrandeur, but rather for their quiet beauty, the water falling over\r\nledges but a few feet in height, and so broken in two of them as to\r\npresent the general appearance of a succession of stairs, or steps, of\r\nunequal elevation, over which the water falls. An interesting feature\r\nat the junction of the two rivers is the cave in which the pioneer\r\nsettler, Judge Joel Foster, with his negro boy, spent the winter of\r\n1848-49. From his cave cabin he had full view of the falls on the two\r\nstreams, no less beautiful in their winter dress of gleaming icicles,\r\nwith the frost-whitened boughs of the willow and alder drooping over\r\nthem, than in their summer brightness. The judge has told me that he\r\nloved, almost worshiped, this spot. The cave cabin stood about one\r\nhundred feet from the sparkling stream. There, in the early morning,\r\nhe could cast his line, and have for his regal breakfast the speckled\r\ntrout. Above him towered a precipice crowned with evergreen trees, and\r\naround him, on the borders of the streams, were the elm and maple, and\r\nan undergrowth of alder and birch. There certainly could have been no\r\nfairer scene in the West. To-day no traces remain of the old cave\r\ncabin. The Junction mills have effaced the more beautiful and poetic\r\nfeatures of the scene. The judge has passed away, and found a grave on\r\nan elevation overlooking his old home and the scenes he loved so well.\r\nThe judge, although a friend to progress, and active in advancing the\r\nmaterial interests of the locality in which he lived, was unalterably\r\nopposed to the movement to incorporate River Falls, and did all he\r\ncould to defeat the measure. When the incorporative act had been\r\npassed, he moved outside of the city limits, declaring that he would\r\nneither live nor die within them; but having been fatally injured by\r\nan accident, he was brought back to his old home, and died within the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOURTH STATE NORMAL SCHOOL AT RIVER FALLS--HISTORY.\r\n\r\nThe constitution of the State, adopted in 1848, provides \"that the\r\nrevenue of the school fund shall be exclusively applied to the\r\nfollowing objects:\r\n\r\n     \"_First_--To the support and maintenance of common schools\r\n     in each school district, and the purchase of suitable\r\n     libraries and appurtenances therefor.\r\n\r\n     \"_Second_--That the residue of the income of the school fund\r\n     shall be appropriated to the support of academies and normal\r\n     schools, and suitable libraries and appurtenances therefor.\"\r\n\r\nNo effort was made to take advantage of this provision of the\r\nconstitution for the endowment of normal schools until 1857, when an\r\nact was passed providing \"that the income of twenty-five per cent of\r\nthe proceeds arising from the sale of swamp and overflowed lands\r\nshould be appropriated to normal institutes and academies, under the\r\nsupervision and direction of a 'board of regents of normal schools,'\"\r\nwho were to be appointed in pursuance of the provisions of that act.\r\nUnder this law, the income placed at the disposal of the regents was\r\ndistributed for several years to such colleges, academies and high\r\nschools as maintained a normal class, and in proportion to the number\r\nof pupils in the class who passed satisfactory examinations, conducted\r\nby an agent of the board.\r\n\r\nThe law under which these schools are organized provides that \"the\r\nexclusive purpose of each normal school shall be the instruction and\r\ntraining of persons, both male and female, in the theory and art of\r\nteaching, and in all the various branches that pertain to a good\r\ncommon school education, and in all subjects needful to qualify for\r\nteaching in the public schools; also to give instruction in the\r\nfundamental laws of the United States and of this State, and in what\r\nregards the rights and duties of citizens.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULATIONS FOR ADMISSION TO THE NORMAL SCHOOLS.\r\n\r\nTuition is free to all students who are admitted to these normal\r\nschools under the following regulations of the board of regents:\r\n\r\n     _First_--Each assembly district in the State shall be\r\n     entitled to eight representatives in the normal schools, and\r\n     in case vacancies exist in the representation to which any\r\n     assembly district is entitled, such vacancies may be filled\r\n     by the president and secretary of the board of regents.\r\n\r\n     _Second_--Candidates for admission shall be nominated by the\r\n     superintendent of the county (or if the county\r\n     superintendent has not jurisdiction, then the nomination\r\n     shall be made by the city superintendent) in which such\r\n     candidate may reside, and shall be at least sixteen years of\r\n     age, of sound bodily health and good moral character. Each\r\n     person so nominated shall receive a certificate setting\r\n     forth his name, age, health and character.\r\n\r\n     _Third_--Upon the presentation of such certificate to the\r\n     president of a normal school, the candidate shall be\r\n     examined, under the direction of said president, in the\r\n     branches required by law for a third grade certificate,\r\n     except history, theory and practice of teaching, and if\r\n     found qualified to enter the normal school in respect to\r\n     learning, he may be admitted after furnishing such evidence\r\n     as the president may require of good health and good moral\r\n     character, and after subscribing to the following\r\n     declaration:\r\n\r\n     I, ---- ----, do hereby declare that my purpose in entering\r\n     this State Normal School is to fit myself for the profession\r\n     of teaching, and that it is my intention to engage in\r\n     teaching in the schools of the State.\r\n\r\n     _Fourth_--No person shall be entitled to a diploma who has\r\n     not been a member of the school in which such diploma is\r\n     granted, at least one year, nor who is less than nineteen\r\n     years of age; a certificate of attendance may be granted by\r\n     the president of a normal school to any person who shall\r\n     have been a member of such school for one term; provided,\r\n     that in his judgment such certificate is deserved.\r\n\r\nAs an addition to the work of the normal schools, the board of regents\r\nare authorized to expend a sum not exceeding $5,000 annually, to\r\nsustain teachers' institutes, and may employ an agent for that\r\npurpose. Institutes are regarded as important auxiliaries and feeders\r\nto the normal schools. At present one professor from each normal\r\nschool is employed conducting institutes every spring and fall.\r\n\r\nThe normal school fund now amounts to over $1,250,000, and yields an\r\nannual income of about $100,000. It will be increased by the further\r\nsale of swamp lands, and will prove ample for the objects for which it\r\nis set apart.\r\n\r\nIn 1865 the legislature divided the swamp lands and swamp land fund\r\ninto two equal parts, one for drainage purposes, the other to\r\nconstitute a normal school fund. The income of the latter was to be\r\napplied to establishing, supporting and maintaining normal schools,\r\nunder the direction and management of the board of regents of normal\r\nschools, with a proviso that one-fourth of such income should be\r\ntransferred to the common school fund, until the annual income of that\r\nfund should reach $200,000. During the same year, proposals were\r\ninvited for extending aid in establishment of a normal school, and\r\npropositions were received from various places.\r\n\r\nIn 1866 the board of regents was incorporated by the legislature.\r\n\r\nJOEL FOSTER.--Judge Foster was born at Meriden, Connecticut, Dec. 15,\r\n1814. He was liberally educated. He came to Edwardsville, Illinois, in\r\n1830, and to Hudson, then known as Buena Vista, in 1848. After a\r\ncareful exploration of the country he made choice of the valley of the\r\nKinnikinic, and made him a home in the fall of 1848, at the junction\r\nof the two branches of that stream, and within sound of its beautiful\r\ncascades. He was the pioneer settler of the River Falls of to-day. He\r\nbuilt the first dwelling house, raised the first crops, and ever\r\nproved himself a worthy citizen, first in every good work and\r\nenterprise. He was a man of far more than ordinary intelligence and\r\nmoral worth, was temperate, industrious, public spirited, sagacious\r\nand independent.

The first board of supervisors\r\nwere William Thing, chairman; Aaron Cornelius, and L. M. Harnsberger;\r\nclerk, Hilton Doe; treasurer, Geo. W. McMurphy. In 1851, by\r\nlegislative enactment, the name Elisabeth was changed to Prescott.\r\n\r\n[C] A member of the well known Faribault family, after whom the town\r\nof Faribault has been named.\r\n\r\n[D] NOTE.--When I touched at Prescott in 1845, it was generally known\r\nas the \"Mouth of St. Croix,\" though by some called \"Prescott's\r\nLanding.\" The residents were Hilton Doe, a farmer; Geo. Schaser,\r\nboarding house keeper; W. S. Lockwood, merchant; Joseph Mosier, an\r\nIndian trader or storekeeper. The principal trade was with Indians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nBURNETT, WASHBURN, SAWYER AND BARRON COUNTIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nBURNETT COUNTY.\r\n\r\nBurnett county was named in honor of a genial, kind hearted and\r\neccentric lawyer, Thomas Pendleton Burnett, of Prairie du Chien. It is\r\nsomewhat irregular in outline, and is bounded on the north by Douglas,\r\non the east by Barron, on the south by Polk and Barron counties, and\r\non the west by the St. Croix river. It includes townships 37 to 42,\r\nrange 14; from 38 to 42, range 15; from 38 to 41, ranges 16 and 17;\r\nfrom 37 to 40, ranges 18 and 19; from 37 to 38, range 20. Seven of\r\nthese townships bordering on the St. Croix are fractional. Much of the\r\nsoil of the county is a sandy loam admirably suited to cereals and\r\nvegetables. Some townships in the southeast are first class wheat\r\nlands. The timber is mostly a thicket-like growth of small pines,\r\nconstituting what is called pine barrens. The southeast portion of the\r\ncounty is timbered with hardwoods. It is drained by the St. Croix,\r\nTrade, Wood, Clam, Yellow, and Namakagon rivers, with their\r\ntributaries, and with the Wood lakes (Big and Little), Mud Hen, Trade,\r\nYellow, Spirit, and numerous other lakes. There are besides many\r\nthousand acres of marsh land. These marsh lands are by no means\r\nvalueless, as they have given rise to a very important industry--the\r\ngrowing of cranberries. There are fine deposits of iron. Large tracts\r\nof bog ore are found in townships 38 to 41, ranges 16 to 19. There is\r\nan abundance of wild meadow land, easily drained and profitable to\r\nstock growers.\r\n\r\nThe settlers of this county are, for the greater part, Swedish and\r\nNorwegian emigrants, an intelligent, moral and religious class of\r\npeople who, while they cherish the traditions, manners, customs and\r\nlanguage of their native country, still readily adapt themselves to\r\nAmerican institutions, taking kindly to our common school system and\r\nto other distinctive features of their adopted country. A liberal\r\nspirit has characterized these people in building roads, bridges,\r\nschool houses, churches, and making other public improvements. They\r\nhave succeeded well also in their private enterprises, the cultivation\r\nof farms and the building of homes.\r\n\r\n\r\nORGANIZATION.\r\n\r\nThe county, originally a part of Polk, was set off March 1, 1856, and\r\nincluded also at that time, and till the year 1877, the present county\r\nof Washburn. It was organized in 1865. The first county officers,\r\nappointed by the governor, were: Judge, Nimrod H. Hickerson; clerk of\r\ncourt, Canute Anderson; register of deeds, Peter Anderson; treasurer,\r\nS. Thompson; sheriff, Martin B. Johnson; district attorney, Jacob\r\nLarson. Grantsburg was selected as the county seat. The first county\r\nsupervisors, consisting of Michael Jenson, chairman, Thore Ingebritson\r\nand Peter Anderson, met Jan. 24, 1865. The first election was held at\r\nthe house of Nimrod H. Hickerson, Nov. 7, 1865. The first frame house\r\nin the county was built at Grantsburg in 1865, by W. H. Peck. The\r\nfirst crops were raised in township 39, range 18, by Charles Ayer. The\r\nfinances of the county have been managed discreetly. The state\r\ndrainage fund was judiciously expended. The first deed recorded in\r\nBurnett county was a tax deed from Polk county to Simon Estonson, of\r\nthe southeast quarter of the southwest quarter of section 35, township\r\n38, range 19. It bears date Jan. 20, 1866.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PINE BARRENS.\r\n\r\nSo prominent a feature in Burnett and other counties in Northwest\r\nWisconsin, consist of sandy stretches of undulating, though sometimes\r\nof level lands, sparsely covered with a growth of young pines,\r\ngenerally of the Black Prince variety. In some places, where the trees\r\nare crowded thickly together, they are not unlike immense cane-brakes.\r\nThe trees, from their proximity, have grown very tall and slender. The\r\nlateral branches, crowded together and deprived of sunshine, have\r\nperished early and the growth of the young trees is chiefly vertical.\r\nThe lower dead limbs remaining attached to the trunks give the young\r\nforest a peculiarly ragged and tangled appearance. There is abundant\r\nevidence to prove the existence of ancient pine forests where these\r\npine barrens are now the only growth. In fact some of the larger trees\r\nare still standing, and the charred trunks and decaying remnants of\r\nothers. The gradations from the younger to the older growth may be\r\nvery plainly seen. Fire is undoubtedly the efficient cause of the\r\nstunted and irregular growth of the pine barrens. The matured forests\r\nare destroyed by fire, and are succeeded by the young pines which are\r\nfurther reduced and injured by annual fires. It is a mistake to\r\nsuppose that the soil of these barrens is necessarily poor. Many of\r\nthem have a black, sandy soil, capable of producing fine crops. In\r\nmost of them there is a dense undergrowth of blueberry bushes,\r\nproducing annually millions and millions of bushels of their small but\r\nluscious fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\nMURDERS.\r\n\r\nBurnett county is not without the traditions of lawlessness and murder\r\nthat tarnish so many frontier settlements, and here, as elsewhere, the\r\nprimal cause of most of such crimes is whisky. Whisky maddens the\r\nbrain and nerves the arm of the assassin. Whisky hardens the heart and\r\nblinds the eyes to what is right, and the sale of whisky on the\r\nfrontier, authorized or unauthorized, in nearly all cases the latter,\r\nis the bartering of the human life for gold. The money received for it\r\nis the price of blood, although in some instances the seller himself\r\nmay be the victim. It is whisky that does the work.\r\n\r\nJack Drake, a whisky seller at Wood Lake, whose outfit was supplied by\r\nSamuels & Partridge, naturally of a quarrelsome disposition, was\r\nespecially so when under the influence of liquor. On one of these\r\noccasions he was killed by a half-breed known as Robideau, and his\r\nbody was buried on the shores of Little Wood lake. Robideau was\r\nimprisoned a short time at St. Croix Falls, but being carelessly\r\nguarded, easily made his escape and was not heard of afterward. What\r\ndid it matter? It was only the result of a drunken row.\r\n\r\nThe body of a murdered stranger was found by a crew of men working on\r\nLittle Wood river, in the spring of 1843. He had left Superior City\r\nwith an Indian guide for St. Paul, and was not afterward seen alive.\r\nHis land warrants and watch, which had been taken from him, were\r\nafterward recovered, and the Indian who had been his guide was\r\nhimself mysteriously assassinated the following spring.\r\n\r\nGEEZHIC.--At Wood Lake, Burnett county, Wisconsin, lived in 1874 an\r\naged and blind Indian woman who calculated her pilgrimage on earth by\r\nmoons. All traces of her traditional beauty as an Indian maiden had\r\nlong since departed. Shriveled, decrepit, bent, she was the\r\nimpersonation of all that is unlovely and repulsive in age. Taciturn\r\nand sullen, her mind lethargic and dull, she seemed but little more\r\nthan half alive, and could not easily be aroused to the comprehension\r\nof passing events, or to the recognition of those around her. She must\r\nhave been very old. When aroused to consciousness, which was but\r\nseldom, she would talk of things long past. A light would come into\r\nher sightless eyes as she recounted the traditions, or described the\r\nmanners and customs of her people, and spoke with evident pride of\r\ntheir ancient power and prowess when her people planted their tepees\r\non the shores of the \"Shining Big Sea Water\" (Lake Superior) and drove\r\ntheir enemies, the Dakotahs, before them. Her people wore blankets\r\nmade from the skins of the moose; elk and buffalo, with caps from the\r\nskins of the otter and beaver. There was then an abundance of \"kego\"\r\n(fish) and \"wash-kish\" (deer). There were no pale faces then in all\r\nthe land to drive them from their tepees and take their hunting\r\ngrounds. Of course there had been occasional whites, hunters, trappers\r\nand missionaries, but the formidable movements of the now dominant\r\nrace had not fairly commenced. Counting the years of her life on her\r\nfingers, so many moons representing a year, she must have numbered a\r\nscore beyond a century, and she had consequently witnessed, before her\r\neyes were dimmed, the complete spoliation of her people's ancestral\r\ndomain.\r\n\r\nThe physical features of the country have undergone a change. The\r\ntowering pines have decayed or been leveled by the woodman's axe. Some\r\nof the small lakes have receded, and tall grasses wave and willows\r\ngrow where once the \"kego\" sported in the clear blue waters. \"The sun\r\ndrew the waters up into the heavens,\" but the old shores may still be\r\ntraced, by the fresh water shells that are crushed by the foot of the\r\nexplorer, and by the ineffaceable mark of the water breaking upon the\r\nbeach and undermining the rocky ledges.\r\n\r\nA few Indians still linger on the old hunting grounds and about the\r\ngraves of their fathers, but as a race they are doomed, and the time\r\nis not far distant when their only memorials will be the printed or\r\nstriped rocks that are found along the streams and lakes, and here and\r\nthere the sunken graves of the vanquished race.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST MISSION.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of the year 1833 the first mission was established in\r\nthe St. Croix valley, at the outlet of Yellow lake, in Burnett county.\r\nThis may be considered the first actual movement in opening the way\r\nfor white settlements in the St. Croix valley. The good and\r\nindefatigable laborers, who came away into these western wilds, spent\r\nmany years in this valley endeavoring to improve the benighted\r\naborigines. Their labors were successful, until the bane of the human\r\nfamily--alcoholic drinks--was introduced by the corrupt border\r\ntraders. Rev. Fred Ayer (since a resident of Belle Prairie, Minnesota,\r\nand a member of the convention that framed our constitution), Mrs.\r\nAyer, with Miss Crooks (afterward Mrs. Boutwell) as teacher, arrived\r\nat Yellow Lake Sept. 16, 1833. Miss Crooks opened her school on the\r\ntwenty-fourth, with eight scholars. This was evidently the first\r\nschool in the St. Croix valley. This mission was under the patronage\r\nof the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. Thirty or\r\nforty Indians came to the trading house, a mile from the mission, for\r\nthe purpose of obtaining ammunition and moccasins for making what is\r\ncalled the fall hunt. During their visit at the traders', Mr. Ayer had\r\nthe opportunity of explaining the object of his mission--schooling\r\ntheir children, and aiding them in agriculture, planting their\r\ngardens, and furnishing them with seeds. To the objects of the mission\r\nall listened with interest, but, as the chiefs were not present, no\r\nreply was made to Mr. Ayer. After obtaining their supplies from the\r\ntraders, they dispersed for their fall hunt. The school in the\r\nmeantime progressed, and frequent opportunities occurred for giving\r\nreligious instructions to adults during the winter. In April some\r\ntwenty-five families encamped near the mission; many were interested\r\nin the objects which the mission proposed. In the spring of 1834 four\r\nfamilies made gardens by the mission and schooled their children;\r\nthree of the families belonged to the influential in the band. One of\r\nthese, the chief who visited Washington during the administration of\r\nAdams, was Gis-kil-a-way, or \"Cat Ear.\"\r\n\r\nThe Indian mind is suspicious of the white man. Waiingas, \"The Wolf,\"\r\nanother chief of considerable note, was prejudicing the minds of his\r\nfriends against the whites. He openly declared that if the Indians\r\nwould join him, he would burn the mission house and drive the teachers\r\nfrom his country. On one occasion a party of Indians, including this\r\nhostile chief, passed the evening at Mr. Ayer's. The chief closed his\r\nspeech at midnight with these words: \"The Indians are troubled in mind\r\nabout your staying here, and you must go--you shall go; not only I say\r\nso, but all here present say so!\" The next morning all the Indians\r\nassembled. The trader, the late Dr. Borup, and his wife were present.\r\nThe Wolf and his party were determined to expel all the whites. The\r\nfriend of the white man, Cat Ear, took the floor and shaking hands\r\nwith Dr. Borup and Mr. Ayer, began a speech of half an hour's length.\r\nPointing to The Wolf and to two other chiefs sitting side by side, he\r\nsays: \"I speak for them. Look at them. To them belong this land. Since\r\nlast evening we have considered this subject. We have changed our\r\nminds. The Great Spirit made us all--made us red--you white. He gave\r\nyou your religion, manners and customs--he gave us ours. Before we saw\r\nwhite man we dressed in skins and cooked with stones. You found our\r\nland on the map and come--since then you have clothed and provided for\r\nus. Why should we send you away? We only should be the sufferers--all\r\nof us tell you to stay--again we say, stay. We do not wish you to go;\r\nno, no--we say to you all, stay; you may plant and build, but the land\r\nis ours. Our Great Father has sent you here--we are glad--we will tell\r\nyou why we fear the whites--we fear you will get our land away. If\r\nthis room were full of goods we would not exchange our lands for them.\r\nThis land is ours and our children's; it is all we have.\"\r\n\r\nThe mission at Yellow Lake had been in progress two years. Several\r\nfamilies had listened with glowing interest to religious instruction,\r\nschooled their children, and cultivated gardens near the mission, when\r\nMr. Ayer visited the band of Indians at Pokegama. Here were some\r\nthirty-five or forty families in the year 1835. The chief and two or\r\nthree families expressed to him a desire to settle down and school\r\ntheir children. They requested him to come and bring all with him who\r\nwished to come from Yellow Lake. The reasons that induced him to\r\nPokegama were, first, the means of subsistence were more abundant,\r\nboth for the Indians and the mission family--wild rice and fish in\r\nparticular; this being the case the Indians could be more stationary\r\nand send their children to school. Second, the soil for agricultural\r\npurposes was superior to that of Yellow Lake. As one of the leading\r\nobjects of the mission was to induce the Indians to settle down and\r\nadopt habits of civilization, this object could be better attained at\r\nthis place than at Yellow Lake, where it was comparatively sterile and\r\nsandy. A third object gained would be to locate in the midst of a\r\nlarger number of Indians, with whom we could come in more frequent\r\ncontact, and last, but not least, put the mission in a nearer point of\r\ncommunication with St. Peter, from whence all the family necessaries\r\nwere obtained at that day. These reasons, together with the\r\nsolicitation of one of the chiefs, and his permission to build on his\r\nland, and use his wood, water and fish, led Mr. Ayer, in the fall of\r\n1835, to remove to Pokegama.\r\n\r\nFor the continued history of this mission the reader is referred to\r\nthe history of Pine county.\r\n\r\nCHIPPEWAS OF WOOD LAKE.--A small band of Chippewas, as late as 1870,\r\nlingered about Big Wood lake, unwilling to leave their old hunting\r\ngrounds. Though brought directly in contact with civilization, they\r\nadopted its vices, otherwise remaining savages, taking no part in\r\ncultivating the soil or educating their children, contented to live\r\nand die in the old fashion of their race. They subsist, as far as\r\npossible, by hunting and fishing, and are by no means above begging\r\nwhen occasion may offer. They retain their annual dances and\r\nfestivals, at the occurrence of which other bands join them from a\r\ndistance. A dance with its accompanying feasts occupies generally\r\nabout ten days, and is conducted according to rigid formulas. These\r\ndances are intended as representations of hunting, fishing or\r\nfighting, and are honored accordingly. They are accompanied with music\r\nupon rude instruments, and a weird chant in guttural and nasal tones,\r\nwhich may be understood as a poetic recital of their deeds or\r\nexpression of their feelings. Their dead are buried in conspicuous\r\nplaces. The graves are decorated with splints of timber. A pole with\r\nrags and trinkets is planted near the graves. There is nothing that\r\ncan long mark their resting places or keep them from being desecrated\r\nby the share of the plowman.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRANTSBURG\r\n\r\nWas founded by Canute Anderson, in 1865, in section 14, town 38, range\r\n19. He built a flour and saw mill, the first in the county, a good\r\nhotel, and opened a store. It became the centre of trade for the\r\ncounty, prospered continuously, and now (in 1886) contains a good\r\ncourt house, built at a cost of $7,000 (burned December, 1887), a\r\nschool house, four churches, two hotels, five stores and numerous\r\nshops and dwellings. There are two resident lawyers and one physician.\r\nGrantsburg is the terminus of the St. Paul & Duluth (branch) railroad,\r\ncompleted in 1884. The scheme of building a branch road to connect\r\nwith the St. Paul & Duluth railroad at Rush City was long cherished by\r\nCanute Anderson, and through his efforts the road was finally built.\r\nThe county voted $20,000 bonds, at seven per cent interest, which\r\nbonds the state of Wisconsin cashed. The road was graded from\r\nGrantsburg to the St. Croix river in 1878, from Rush City to St. Croix\r\nin 1882. The St. Paul & Duluth Railroad Company built the railroad and\r\nassumed the bonded indebtedness, payable in fifteen annual\r\ninstallments. Cars ran to the St. Croix river in 1883. The bridge over\r\nthe St. Croix, completed in 1883, cost $20,000. The road was opened to\r\nGrantsburg Jan. 22, 1884. At this opening over a thousand persons were\r\npresent, five hundred of whom came in on the train. Canute Anderson\r\nmade an address of welcome, followed by James Smith, president of the\r\nroad. Congratulatory letters were read from Hons. S. S. Fifield, Henry\r\nM. Rice, and W. H. C. Folsom, the tenor of which was highly\r\ncomplimentary to Mr. Anderson, and full of hope for the future of the\r\nrailroad and its terminus.\r\n\r\nCANUTE ANDERSON was born in Norway, 1830. He came to America in 1851,\r\nand three years later settled in the northeast quarter of section 2,\r\ntownship 37, range 19, making a large stock farm, part of it being a\r\nfine natural meadow, with running stream. In 1858 the first post\r\noffice in the county (called Anderson) was established at his house,\r\nand he was appointed postmaster. In 1878 he represented Ashland,\r\nBarron, Bayfield, Burnett, Douglas, and Polk counties in the\r\nlegislature. He is and ever has been a master spirit in his county,\r\nusing all his influence to further the interests of his adopted home.\r\nMany of the early settlers were poor,--strangers in a strange\r\nland,--and for them Mr. Anderson's house was ever a resort. It was\r\nalso an intelligence office, where the inquiring immigrant could\r\nobtain reliable information as to the country and its resources, and\r\nfacilities to the settler. In 1860 Mr. Anderson was married to\r\nCatharine Nelson, daughter of Magnus Nelson, one of Burnett county's\r\nfirst settlers.\r\n\r\nTHE HICKERSON FAMILY came from Ohio to Wisconsin. Nimrod H., the\r\noldest brother, settled on Wood river in 1859, built a saw mill, kept\r\na hotel and established a post office on the St. Paul and Bayfield\r\nstage route in 1860. Mr. Hickerson went to California in 1875, and\r\ndied there. Joel, the second brother, is a merchant at Grantsburg. He\r\nserved during the later years of the Civil War as a soldier, Company\r\nC, Seventh Minnesota Volunteers, and was pensioned for disabilities.\r\nHe was married in 1868 to Mary Anderson. Perry D., the third brother,\r\nkeeps a hotel in Grantsburg. He was also a member of Company C,\r\nSeventh Minnesota Volunteers, and with his brother was mustered out at\r\nthe close of the war, and has received a pension for disabilities. He\r\nwas married to Ellen M. Anderson, daughter of Peter Anderson. They\r\nhave eleven children. Newton, the fourth son, lives in Grantsburg. He\r\nwas a soldier in Company D, Twenty-first Ohio, during the war. Was\r\nwounded and totally disabled. He has no pension. He is unmarried.\r\n\r\nTHE ANDERSON FAMILY.--The four brothers, Peter, George, Hans and\r\nMartin, with their aged parents, came from Norway and settled in\r\nGrantsburg in 1883. The father but recently died. The mother is still\r\nliving, having reached the extreme age of ninety-seven years. During\r\nthe last six years she has been blind. Peter Anderson was married in\r\nNorway in 1846. His wife died in 1877, leaving three sons and four\r\ndaughters. He was married to his second wife in 1878. Peter has served\r\nas county supervisor, and filled other offices. The brothers have been\r\nactive in promoting the interests of their town and county.\r\n\r\nROBERT A. DOTY was born in Niagara county, New York; lived some years\r\nin Genesee county, Michigan, and settled in Sterling, Polk county, in\r\n1865. He subsequently became the first settler in the town of\r\nMarshfield, Burnett county. He was accidentally killed in 1879 by\r\nbeing thrown from his wagon. His widow and two sons live in\r\nGrantsburg. John H., the oldest son, resides on the old homestead in\r\nSterling.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRANBERRY MARSHES.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of the cranberry is an important industry in Burnett\r\ncounty. The berry is raised chiefly in townships 38 and 39, ranges 17\r\nand 18. The writer of these sketches visited the localities named in\r\n1873, and although there have been many changes and improvements since\r\nthen, the description quoted from an essay read before the\r\nHorticultural Society will still be generally applicable:\r\n\r\n     \"The scene on approaching these marshes, where the native\r\n     cranberry was found, before the white man had commenced to\r\n     improve them, was picturesque in the extreme to those who\r\n     have a taste for Nature's handiwork. There are extensive\r\n     tracts of land covering thousands of acres, dotted here and\r\n     there with islands of young pine and points of highland\r\n     projecting in various shapes into the marshes. It reminded\r\n     me of an ocean bay, in a calm, only changing the ocean water\r\n     color to endless green. There are in these marshes somewhere\r\n     from one to two townships of land, on which cranberries were\r\n     then growing, or susceptible of being improved so that\r\n     cranberries can be raised thereon. One township contains\r\n     23,040 acres. The parties operating on the marshes I visited\r\n     already have some 30 or 40 miles of ditch made, averaging 5\r\n     feet at the top, 3 feet at the bottom, with an average depth\r\n     of 4 feet, at a cost of about 75 cents per rod. These\r\n     ditches are to drain the water from the marshes when\r\n     desired. They have dams across these ditches, to flood the\r\n     marshes when desired. The flooding of the marshes aids in\r\n     subduing the wild grasses and other incumbrances, also is\r\n     essential to the growth of the berries. On these marshes,\r\n     wherever the flowage is killing the grass, the vine is\r\n     rapidly spreading, without transplanting. Undoubtedly they\r\n     would yield a quicker return by transplanting. Large tracts\r\n     of these lands, which, at this time have no vines, are\r\n     bought by companies, mostly from the cranberry lands in\r\n     Eastern Wisconsin, who are experienced in this business, and\r\n     know what they are doing. They openly declare that vines can\r\n     be grown on these marshes, where sufficient water can be\r\n     obtained and controlled to flow the lands. Mr. Irvine\r\n     informed me that this flooding process, and the manner in\r\n     which it was controlled, was the key to success. I examined\r\n     the effect which one year alone had accomplished, as these\r\n     companies commenced operations in 1872. It surprised me when\r\n     I saw the mode, and heard it explained, that so little was\r\n     generally known of this business. After the marshes are\r\n     subdued, dams and ditches built, there is comparatively\r\n     small cost in raising the fruit until the harvest, when men,\r\n     women and children flock in from the farming countries to\r\n     pick, to pack, to store, to dry, to box, and convey to\r\n     market. An expert will pick from five to ten bushels per day\r\n     by hand, no rakes being allowed. In 1873 these marshes had\r\n     an abundant yield. These companies paid to outsiders one\r\n     dollar and fifty cents per bushel. There are several\r\n     companies operating in Burnett county. They have made and\r\n     are making substantial improvements, in building roads, dry\r\n     houses, dwelling houses, etc. The past year a saw mill was\r\n     erected for sawing staves for barrels, lumber for boxes,\r\n     etc. These marshes are about twenty miles east of the\r\n     Superior railroad.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHBURN COUNTY.\r\n\r\nWashburn county was organized in 1883, and embraces townships 37 to\r\n42, inclusive, and ranges 10 to 13, inclusive, a total of 24\r\ntownships. It is drained by St. Croix waters with the exception of the\r\nsoutheast corner, which is drained by a branch of the Chippewa river.\r\nIt has been a rich timbered region and large forests of pine still\r\nremain. The greater part of the county is adapted to agriculture, and\r\nis settling rapidly. Two lines of railway traverse the county, one\r\nfrom south to north, and the other from southwest to northeast, giving\r\nthe county excellent facilities for transportation and marketing of\r\nproducts. The county is divided into two towns, Bashaw in the south\r\nand Veasie in the north. These towns were organized in 1877, while\r\nWashburn was a part of Burnett county. The first supervisors of Bashaw\r\nwere: L. E. Thomas, chairman; John Arbuckle and John McMullen. The\r\ntown of Bashaw was the first settled. John McMullen settled in\r\ntownship 38, range 13, in 1872, in Bashaw valley. He married a member\r\nof the Hart family, old settlers of the town. He died in 1878. L. E.\r\nThomas was the second settler in Bashaw and in Washburn county, and\r\nhas been officially connected with the town and county organization.\r\nHe is a native of Michigan, and has followed lumbering and farming. L.\r\nE. Thomas built the first house. Nellie Raberge taught the first\r\nschool in Bashaw, in 1881. Miss Raberge has since become the wife of\r\nMilton Stratton. The first post office was established in 1880, Mrs.\r\nMalcolm Dobie, postmistress. The first sermon was preached by Rev.\r\nEllingwood. G. P. Pearly was the first physician; A. L. Bugbee, the\r\nfirst lawyer. Messrs. Hart, Baker, Gardner and others have large farms\r\nin Bashaw valley. By the act organizing the county,\r\n\r\n\r\nSHELL LAKE\r\n\r\nwas made the county seat. It is beautifully located on the shores of\r\nSummit lake. It has a court house, built at a cost of $11,000, in\r\n1885, one of the most tasteful buildings of the kind in the St. Croix\r\nvalley. The town is built on railroad lands, purchased by the Shell\r\nLake Lumber Company, and by them surveyed into lots. The streets are\r\nfrom sixty-six to eighty feet wide. A restriction in the deeds to the\r\nlots and lands against the sale of alcoholic drinks has been\r\ncontinuously violated. In 1883 the town board fixed license at five\r\nhundred dollars, a plain violation of the original agreement.\r\n\r\nA fine school building with four apartments was built in 1885, at a\r\ncost of $5,000. Prof. Halphyde is principal of the schools. The\r\nEpiscopalians and Catholics have church buildings. The Baptists,\r\nMethodists, Lutherans and Presbyterians have church organizations. The\r\nMasons, Good Templars and Knights of Labor have organizations.\r\n\r\nSummit lake, on the west bank of which the town is situated, is about\r\ntwo and a half miles broad by three and a half long. It has bold,\r\ngravelly shores. The water is deep, clear and pure. The slopes\r\nsurrounding it are covered with evergreen, and hardwood timber. One\r\nsmall steamer floats upon its waters.\r\n\r\nThe first board of county officers was as follows: Treasurer, Leander\r\nE. Thomas; clerk, Frank B. Nelson; sheriff, James Wynne; attorney,\r\nFrank Gudette; register of deeds, Albert L. Bugbee; judge, L. H. Mead;\r\nclerk of court, A. Gibson; superintendent of schools, Clara Stratton;\r\nsurveyor, Patrick Kelly. The first circuit court was held in June,\r\n1883, Hon. S. S. Clough, presiding. The county has two court terms for\r\nthe year, in June and December.\r\n\r\nThe Shell Lake Lumber Company was organized in 1880, under Iowa laws.\r\nIt is composed of C. Lamb and David Joice and sons, of Clinton, Iowa;\r\nLaird, Norton & Co., of Winona; Weyerhauser & Dinkeman, of Rock\r\nIsland, Illinois; S. T. McKnight, of Hannibal, Missouri; D. R. Moore,\r\nEau Claire, Wisconsin. Their mills are located on the northwest side\r\nof Summit lake. They have a capacity of 50,000,000 feet per year. The\r\ncapital stock amounts to $500,000. Employment is furnished to 250 men.\r\nIn 1880 the hour system of labor was adopted. A narrow gauge railroad,\r\ntwelve miles long, supplied with two locomotives and fifty cars, is\r\nused for bringing logs to mill. This road has a steel track and 3,000\r\nfeet of piling. The refuse burner of the mill is 20 feet in diameter\r\nand 102 in height. There are 63 tenement houses to accommodate the\r\nlaborers. A. H. Earle superintends this vast concern.\r\n\r\nSawyer creek obtained its name from Seth M. Sawyer, of Stillwater.\r\nThis stream flows into Yellow river, five miles from Summit lake. It\r\nrises from springs three hundred feet from the lake, and one hundred\r\nfeet lower down, and may be considered its subterranean outlet, as\r\nvisible outlet there is none. The lake, literally a summit lake, the\r\nreceding and descending slopes, the springs uniting to form a larger\r\nstream, form a peculiar landscape, quite park-like in some of its\r\nfeatures, and worthy of being converted into a park.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPOONER,\r\n\r\nIn the township of Veazie, on the north branch of the Yellow river,\r\ntownship 39, range 12, is a dinner station on the North Wisconsin\r\nrailroad. The railroad company have fitted up an elegant eating house,\r\nand a few neat buildings, the nucleus of a much larger village,\r\ncluster around it.\r\n\r\n\r\nVEAZIE VILLAGE\r\n\r\nIs in township 41, range 10, and has a post office. The town of\r\nVeazie, occupying the northern part of the county, was organized in\r\n1877. Millions of feet of pine timber have been gathered and marketed\r\nfrom this town, and it is estimated that 150,000,600 feet still\r\nremain. Ames and Sinnot station are in the township of Veazie.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAWYER COUNTY.\r\n\r\nSawyer county was organized March 9, 1883. It is comprised of\r\ntownships 37 to 42, and ranges 5 to 9, inclusive. Of these townships\r\ntwenty-five are drained by Chippewa waters and five by Namakagon\r\nriver. The county is heavily timbered with pine, though vast\r\nquantities have been taken and marketed. The county seat was located\r\nat Hayward in the bill organizing the county. The county officers,\r\nappointed by Gov. Rusk, were: Sheriff, A. Blaisdell; clerk, C. H.\r\nClapperton; register of deeds, H. E. Ticknor; treasurer, R. L.\r\nMcCormack; county judge, H. W. Hart; attorney, N. E. Ticknor;\r\nsuperintendent of schools, Miss M. Mears; surveyor, W. J. Moulton;\r\ncoroner, E. G. Gregg.\r\n\r\nThe court house was built in 1885, at a cost of $18,000. The county at\r\nits organization assumed the following indebtedness:\r\n\r\nTo Ashland county                                       $25,000\r\nTo town of Ashland, Ashland county                        1,870\r\nTo town of Butternut, Ashland county                      2,050\r\nTo Chippewa county                                        1,900\r\nTo town of Flambeau, Chippewa county (disputed claim)     5,000\r\nTo town of Big Bend, Chippewa county                      3,000\r\nTo town of Sigel, Chippewa county                         2,000\r\n\r\nOutside indebtedness, total                             $40,820\r\n\r\nAll this indebtedness, with the exception of the unsettled claim of\r\nFlambeau, Chippewa county, has been paid. Since its organization the\r\ncounty has expended $30,000 on roads to Chippewa waters. This, added\r\nto the cost of the court house, $18,000, a school house for the town\r\nof Hayward, $6,500, town hall for Hayward $5,000, makes a total of\r\nexpenditures for the county within the past three years of $106,420, a\r\nremarkable sum for a new county with so sparse a population to pay,\r\nbut not so remarkable when we take into account the immense value of\r\nits lumber products and standing timber.\r\n\r\nHayward is the only town in the county. Its first board of supervisors\r\nwere: A. J. Hayward, chairman; Thos. Manwarin and Michael Jordan. A.\r\nL. McCormack was first treasurer, and C. C. Claghorn, clerk. The\r\nvillage is situated in sections 21 and 22, township 41, range 9, upon\r\na level pine plateau on the north side of Namakagon river, a tributary\r\nof the St. Croix. The village was platted in 1883, but a post office\r\nhad been established the year before, C. H. Clapperton being the first\r\npostmaster. The first marriage in the town of Hayward and county of\r\nSawyer was that of Fred Emmons and Mary Lindmark, in 1883. The first\r\nbirth was that of a daughter to Al. Blaisdell. The first death was\r\nthat of Nels J. Eggin. Rev. A. Safford preached the first sermon. Anna\r\nShafer taught the first school. E. G. Gregg opened the first store.\r\nH. E. Ticknor was the first lawyer and J. B. Trowbridge the first\r\nphysician.\r\n\r\nThe first school house, built at a cost of $5,000, was burned. There\r\nwas an insurance of $4,500. A new building was erected at a cost of\r\n$6,000, with three departments, and with steam heating apparatus.\r\nProf. F. A. Nichols was the principal.\r\n\r\nThe Congregational church at Hayward is one of the finest church\r\nbuildings in the Northwest. It is built in the Queen Anne style, with\r\ncircular seats, the whole finished in exquisite taste. Senator Sawyer,\r\nafter whom the county was named, contributed a town clock and bell\r\nworth $1,000. The Catholics have a church here, and the Lutherans an\r\norganization. The Odd Fellows and Knights of Labor have organizations.\r\n\r\nThe Sawyer County Bank was organized March 9, 1884, with a capital\r\nstock of $200,000, divided equally between three stockholders, R. L.\r\nMcCormack, A. J. Hayward and E. H. Halbert, the latter being general\r\nmanager and cashier. The bank deals in real estate, abstracts,\r\ninsurance and general monetary business. The business transacted for\r\nthe year ending June 6, 1886, amounted to $3,000,000. The bank\r\nbuilding is a substantial brick. The Hayward Lumber Company has a mill\r\non the Namakagon river. The water power has a fall of eighteen feet\r\nand a flowage of about three miles. A sixty foot channel has been left\r\nthrough the flowage for slucing logs. The saw mill has a capacity of\r\n35,000,000 feet per annum. It has a planing mill attached. The company\r\nis composed of T. F. Robinson, Weyerhauser & Dinkeman and R. L.\r\nMcCormack. Mr. Weyerhauser is president of the company. Mr.\r\nWeyerhauser is also president of the Rock Island Lumber Company and of\r\nWeyerhauser, Dinkeman & Co., of Rock Island, and is a stockholder in\r\nRenwick, Crosset & Co., Cloquet, Minnesota, Shell Lake, Barronett,\r\nMasons, White River, and Chippewa Falls Lumber companies, and is\r\npresident of the Beef Slough Boom and Chippewa and Mississippi Logging\r\ncompanies. Mr. Weyerhauser is the most extensive holder and owner of\r\nunoperated pine lands in the West, or probably on the continent. The\r\nstockholders of the Hayward Lumber Company are all men of wealth\r\naccumulated by their own industry. Mr. R. L. McCormack, the resident\r\nstockholder and manager, is admirably adapted for the position he\r\nholds. Mr. McCormack was a citizen of Minnesota for fourteen years,\r\nand a member of the Minnesota legislature in 1881. He was born in\r\nPennsylvania in 1847.\r\n\r\nDobie & Stratton, contractors for pine stumpage on the Lac Oreilles\r\nIndian reservation, reside in Hayward. They cut 28,000,000 feet of\r\nlogs in the winter of 1885-86.\r\n\r\nMALCOMB DOBIE, of this firm, is a native of Canada. He came to the St.\r\nCroix valley in 1864, and was married to Harriet Stratton, at St.\r\nCroix Falls, in 1874.\r\n\r\nMILTON V. STRATTON, brother of Mrs. Dobie, was raised at St. Croix\r\nFalls, and engaged in business with Mr. Dobie. In 1886, his health\r\nfailing, he removed to California.\r\n\r\n\r\nBARRON COUNTY.\r\n\r\nBarron county was formerly a heavily timbered tract of country, but is\r\nnow being rapidly cleared and settled. It is well watered by the Red\r\nCedar and its tributaries, and has many beautiful lakes, among them\r\nTurtle, Beaver, Chetek, Red Cedar, Rice, Bear, and Long lakes. The\r\ncounty was first established as Dallas county, in 1859, and attached\r\nto Polk for judicial purposes. In 1868 it was organized for county and\r\njudicial purposes, and the county seat was changed from Manhattan to\r\nBarron, section 26, township 34, range 12. By act of legislature in\r\n1869, the name of the county was changed to Barron, and the county\r\nseat was called by the same name, in honor of Hon. Henry D. Barron,\r\nthen judge of the Eleventh circuit. It comprises townships 32 to 36,\r\ninclusive, and ranges 10 to 14, in all 25 townships. Barron county has\r\nthree railroads, on the lines of which thriving settlements have\r\nsprung up. The railroads are three, the North Wisconsin, a branch line\r\nof the Omaha, and the Minneapolis, Soo Ste. Marie & Atlantic. The\r\nNorth Wisconsin railroad passes through the northwestern part of the\r\ncounty. The Chippewa Falls & Superior City branch of the Omaha enters\r\nthe southeast corner, and traverses the county in a direction west of\r\nnorth. The Minneapolis, Soo Ste. Marie & Atlantic passes through the\r\nmiddle of the county in a direction from east to west.\r\n\r\n\r\nTURTLE LAKE TOWN\r\n\r\nWas organized in 1879. The village of Turtle Lake is situated in\r\nsections 30 and 31, township 34, range 14. It contains a large saw\r\nmill with a capacity of 40,000,000 feet per annum; a union depot, used\r\nby the North Wisconsin, and Minneapolis, Soo Ste. Marie & Atlantic\r\nrailroads, and stores, shops and dwellings, all new. The Minneapolis,\r\nSoo Ste. Marie & Atlantic railroad was built through the county in\r\n1885, and completed in 1887.\r\n\r\n\r\nBARRON,\r\n\r\nThe county seat, is a growing lumber town, with farming lands to the\r\nsouth. It has a population of over 1,000. The \"Soo Line\" railway has a\r\nstation here.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERLEY VILLAGE\r\n\r\nIs located also in Turtle Lake town, in section 8, township 34, range\r\n14, and on the line of the North Wisconsin railroad. It has a large\r\nsaw mill with a capacity of 16,000,000 feet per annum. The village is\r\nbeautifully located on Horse Shoe lake.\r\n\r\n\r\nCUMBERLAND VILLAGE\r\n\r\nIs situated in the town of Cumberland, section 7, township 35, range\r\n15, on Beaver Dam lake. It is pleasantly situated, and is the largest\r\nvillage on the line of the Northwestern railroad. Its appearance gives\r\nevidence of enterprise and thrift on the part of its citizens. The\r\nBeaver Dam Lumber Company have here a saw mill with a capacity of\r\n24,000,000 feet per annum. Cook & Co. have a saw mill (burned and\r\nrebuilt) with a capacity of 6,000,000 feet. The village has a bank and\r\none newspaper, the Cumberland _Advocate_, first issued in 1880 as the\r\n_Herald_.\r\n\r\nCumberland was organized as a village in 1881, and organized under a\r\ncity charter in 1885. The population is now about 1,700. The\r\nmercantile business will aggregate about $500,000 annually. The\r\naggregate output of lumber is 30,000,000 feet, while other industries\r\naggregate $200,000 per annum. There are four churches, one graded\r\nschool of five departments in which students are prepared to enter\r\ncollege. There is here one banking house.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRAGUE\r\n\r\nIs a village in Cumberland, on the Northwestern railroad. It has a saw\r\nmill with a capacity of about 15,000,000 feet per annum.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMSTOCK,\r\n\r\nIn Cumberland, on the Northwestern railroad, has a shingle mill and\r\nsaw mill, the latter having a capacity of about 5,000,000 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\nBARRONETT,\r\n\r\nIn Cumberland, is located in township 36, range 13, in the midst of a\r\nwell timbered region. Its saw mill, directly on the county line, has a\r\ncapacity of 25,000,000 feet. M. Bowron has a farm adjoining the\r\nvillage of 250 acres, improved and yielding tame grass.\r\n\r\nDe Graw and Granite Lake Mills are also located on the Northwestern\r\nrailroad.\r\n\r\nTurtle Lake, Scott's Siding, Cosgrove, Barron, the county seat,\r\nCameron and Canton, are on the Minneapolis, Soo Ste. Marie & Atlantic\r\nrailroad.\r\n\r\nChetek, Cameron Junction, Rice Lake and Bear Creek are located on the\r\nOmaha branch.\r\n\r\nCHARLES SIMEON TAYLOR.--Mr. Taylor was born in Geneva, Wisconsin,\r\nOctober, 1851; graduated at the Wisconsin State University; studied\r\nlaw and settled at Barron, Barron county, in 1876, where he practices\r\nhis profession and edits the _Barron County Shield_. He was elected\r\nmember of the Thirty-seventh Wisconsin assembly in 1885-86 and\r\nrepresented the counties of Barron, Bayfield, Burnett, Douglas, and\r\nWashburn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nASHLAND, BAYFIELD AND DOUGLAS COUNTIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nASHLAND COUNTY.\r\n\r\nAshland was originally a part of Crawford county, afterward of St.\r\nCroix and La Pointe, and was set off from the latter March 27, 1860.\r\nIt is bounded on the north by Lake Superior and Montreal river, on the\r\neast by Oneida, on the south by Price and Chippewa, and on the west by\r\nBayfield and Chippewa counties. It includes townships 41 to 47, ranges\r\n1, 2, and 3 east of the fourth principal meridian, and townships 41 to\r\n48 west of the same; the northern towns bordering on Montreal river\r\nand Lake Superior are fractional. The group of Apostle islands belongs\r\nto this county. The surface is generally level except where broken by\r\nthe iron and copper ranges in the middle and southern part of the\r\ncounty. The Gogebic range, southeast of Ashland, is especially rich in\r\niron. A railroad along this range connects Ashland with the Michigan\r\nroads. The soil is somewhat varied, ranging from sandy loam in the\r\ninterior, to red clay on the lake shore. The county is drained by Bad,\r\nWhite and Montreal rivers and their tributaries, and the headwaters of\r\nthe Chippewa. The timber is pine, fir, birch, etc.\r\n\r\nThe Apostle islands, situated in Lake Superior at the mouth of\r\nChequamegon bay, form a fine natural harbor. The group consists of\r\ntwenty-two islands, the most considerable of which are Madeline,\r\nOatez, Oak, Hemlock, Rice, Basswood, Presque, Bear, Sand, and\r\nMichigan. The islands range in area from a very few acres up to\r\n14,804. They are heavily timbered with hardwood, have fertile soil,\r\nand are well adapted to farm and garden culture. The largest of these\r\nislands is Madeline, situated directly at the entrance to Chequamegon\r\nbay, and noted as containing the oldest settlement on the lake. Claude\r\nAllouez, a Jesuit missionary, landed at Madeline island Oct. 1, 1665,\r\nand erected a bark chapel at the place now known as La Pointe, and\r\ncommenced instructing the Indians of the Algonquin and Huron tribes.\r\nSince that time the island has been held by missionaries and trading\r\ncompanies, with some pretty long intervals of abandonment. In 1800, M.\r\nCadot, a French trader, came to La Pointe, erected fortified dwellings\r\nand lived here till his death, in 1837. At the commencement of the\r\npresent century the American Fur Company made its headquarters on the\r\nsouthern part of the island, and occupied a post there until 1835,\r\nwhen they removed to La Pointe. Rev. Sherman Hall, of the Presbyterian\r\nchurch, established a mission here in 1830. In 1835 Rev. Father\r\nBaraga, a Catholic missionary, arrived, and built a church which he\r\noccupied until 1841, when he built a better one, which still stands in\r\nthe inclosure of an ancient burying ground. This church contains a\r\npainting said to be over two hundred years old. Some of the graves are\r\nquite ancient, and have quaint inscriptions upon their tombstones. One\r\nthat has often been copied and commented on by tourists is as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"ERECTED\r\n    TO THE MEMORY OF ABRAHAM BEAULIEAU\r\n    WHO WAS ACCIDENTALLY SHOT\r\n    AS A MARK OF AFFECTION\r\n    BY HIS BROTHER.\"\r\n\r\nThese islands are becoming a fashionable resort for tourists, and many\r\nof them have been utilized as pleasant summer residences. Some of them\r\nare occupied by lighthouses of which there are five in all. The\r\nislands abound in brown stone, which is being quarried extensively for\r\nbuilding purposes. The stone for the Milwaukee court house was taken\r\nfrom the quarries on Basswood island.\r\n\r\nLA POINTE COUNTY ELECTION.--In 1848 La Pointe county was set off from\r\nSt. Croix county, and at an election held Nov. 10, 1848, John H. Wells\r\nand Leonard Wheeler were elected justices of the peace, and J. F.\r\nHughes was elected clerk of the board of county commissioners. Returns\r\nof their election and that of members of the legislature were made to\r\nHudson, county seat of St. Croix county.\r\n\r\nHON. JOHN W. BELL, born in New York City in 1805, in his eighth year\r\nwent to Canada with his parents, learned to be a watchmaker, a ship\r\nbuilder and a cooper, and came to La Pointe in 1835, where he has\r\nsince resided. He carried on the coopering business first, for the\r\nAmerican Fur Company, and then for himself established a trading post,\r\nbecame interested in mining stocks, and filled various county offices,\r\nhaving served as county judge and register of deeds a great many\r\nyears. In later life he was postmaster at La Pointe. He was married in\r\n1837 to Miss Margaret Brahant, in the Catholic chapel, by Bishop\r\nBaraga. He died in 1888.\r\n\r\n\r\nASHLAND\r\n\r\nIs situated on a plateau of about thirty feet elevation, on the south\r\nshore and near the head of Chequamegon bay. The first house, a cabin,\r\nwas built in 1854. Other cabins were added the same year. In the cabin\r\nerected by Mr. Asaph Whittlesey, in the winter of 1854-55, was\r\npreached the first sermon in Ashland by Rev. L. H. Wheeler, of the\r\nOdanah mission. A post office was established in March, 1855, Mr.\r\nWhittlesey, postmaster. The first American child born was the second\r\ndaughter of Asaph Whittlesey. The name of Ashland was conferred upon\r\nthe town by Martin Beaser, an ardent admirer of Henry Clay, it being\r\nthe name of Mr. Clay's homestead. The village and post office was\r\nfirst known as Whittlesey, but on the organization of the county in\r\n1860, the name of Ashland was applied to both. The new town was not\r\ndestined to immediate and continuous prosperity, and at one time, in\r\n1863, had decreased so much in population that its post office was\r\ndiscontinued for a period of nine years. After that date it entered\r\nupon an era of prosperity.\r\n\r\nJulia Wheeler taught the first school in 1859. The Methodists\r\norganized the first Protestant society in 1872. The Catholics\r\ncommenced a church building in 1873. In 1872 the first newspaper in\r\nAshland, the _Press_, was established by Sam S. and Hank O. Fifield,\r\nunder whose charge it remained until 1874, when S. S. Fifield bought\r\nhis brother's interest in the paper and has since published it\r\ncontinuously, and in 1888 established a daily.\r\n\r\nIn 1872 the Wisconsin Central railroad commenced work at the bay, and\r\nthe outlay for improvements that year amounted to $244,800. The\r\nWisconsin Central railroad built the Hotel Chequamegon in 1877. It is\r\nbuilt in the form of an L, 120 feet front and 80 feet deep with 400\r\nfeet of veranda, and accommodations for 100 guests. There are numerous\r\nother hotels in the city, and several boarding houses receive guests\r\nduring the summer season. Ashland has vast lumber interests. The\r\nAshland Lumber Company built the first mill, in 1872, which had a\r\ncapacity of about 15,000,000 feet per annum. The Union mill, built in\r\n1878, has a capacity of about 18,000,000 feet. Mueller & Richie's\r\nmill, built in 1881, has a capacity of about 20,000,000 feet. There is\r\nalso a planing mill belonging to Geo. White. Ashland has become a\r\nrailroad centre. The Wisconsin Central, St. Paul & Omaha, Milwaukee &\r\nLake Shore and Northern Pacific concentrate a heavy freight for their\r\nelevators and lake docks. The largest dock in the world was built in\r\nAshland in 1887. It was built almost expressly for iron ore shipments\r\nfrom Penoka and Gogebic ranges.\r\n\r\nASAPH WHITTLESEY selected the site of Ashland in 1854, and in\r\nconjunction with George Kilborn built the first dwelling. He was the\r\nfirst postmaster. He was appointed in 1855. He represented Ashland,\r\nBurnett, Douglas, La Pointe, Polk, and St. Croix in the Wisconsin\r\nassembly in 1860.\r\n\r\nJ. P. T. HASKELL was the second settler in Ashland. He came with his\r\nwife, Nov. 2, 1854, but did not long remain.\r\n\r\nS. S. VAUGHN was born in Cuyahoga county, Ohio, Sept. 2, 1830. He came\r\nwith his brother to La Pointe in 1852, and engaged in the fishing and\r\nfur trade until 1855, when he returned to Ohio. After taking a course\r\nin a commercial college, he returned to Wisconsin in 1856, took a\r\nclaim of one hundred and sixty acres at Ashland and opened a store at\r\nBayfield. In 1856 he surveyed and platted what is known as Vaughn's\r\naddition to Ashland. In 1871 he represented Ashland, Barron, Bayfield,\r\nBurnett, Douglas, and Polk counties in the Wisconsin assembly. At\r\nAshland he built docks, warehouses and a store, and in later years\r\ndealt largely in iron mines and in lumber. He was married to Miss E.\r\nPatrick, of Ohio, in 1864. He died at Ashland, February, 1886. He\r\ninduced the Wisconsin Central Railroad Company to make Ashland their\r\nlake terminus. He did more for that city than any other man.\r\n\r\nEDWIN ELLIS, M.D., was born in Oxford county, Maine; was educated in\r\nFarmington Academy, Colby University and Bowdoin College, where he\r\ngraduated and afterward completed a medical course at the University\r\nof New York. He came West in 1854, and located first at St. Paul, but\r\nin 1855 removed to Ashland where he made a claim, which, in part,\r\nbecame in 1873 Ellis' addition to Ashland. He practiced his profession\r\nat Ashland and Ontonagon, Michigan. He was married in 1850 to Martha\r\nB. Baker, of Sharon, Maine.\r\n\r\nMARTIN BEASER, one of the pre-emptors of the site of Ashland, was born\r\nin Erie county, New York, Oct. 22, 1822. For many years he was a\r\nseafaring man. He spent seven years in whaling, at the close of which\r\ntime he came to Ontonagon in a sailing vessel, and thence with three\r\ncompanions in a dog sledge to Ashland, arriving February, 1856. Here\r\nhe pre-empted land, and assisted in laying out the village. He engaged\r\nin the mercantile business. He was drowned in November, 1866, while\r\ntrying to cross Chequamegon bay in an open boat during a storm. Mr.\r\nBeaser was a public spirited man and freely used his wealth in\r\nattempting to build up Ashland. He never lost faith in the ultimate\r\nprosperity of his adopted home.\r\n\r\nHON. SAM S. FIFIELD was born in Corinna, Penobscot county, Maine, June\r\n24, 1839. His early days were spent in Bangor, and he had but limited\r\nschool privileges. He was early thrown upon his own resources and\r\nlearned lessons in the rough school of life. He spent his time\r\nvariously, as errand boy, hotel clerk, night watch on a steamboat,\r\ntoll keeper; but finally, having served a brief apprenticeship in a\r\nprinting office, he became the proprietor of the _Polk County Press_\r\nin 1862. In 1872 he and his brother Hank O. established the Ashland\r\n_Press_, of which he is now sole editor and publisher. Mr. Fifield\r\nentered the political arena as a Republican and has been remarkably\r\nsuccessful. His record from the Wisconsin blue book is as follows:\r\n\r\n1868-69--Assembly proof-reader and assistant sergeant-at-arms.\r\n1871-72--Assembly sergeant-at-arms.\r\n1874-75-76--Member of assembly from Ashland, Barron, Burnett, Douglas, and\r\nPolk counties.\r\n1876--Speaker of the assembly.\r\n1877--Member of the senate.\r\n1880-81--Member of the senate.\r\n1882-86--Lieutenant governor.\r\n\r\nMr. Fifield was married to Stella Grimes, at Prescott, 1863.\r\nConsidering the disadvantageous circumstances of his youth, Mr.\r\nFifield's career has been a notable one.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAYFIELD COUNTY.\r\n\r\nBayfield county includes townships 43 to 52, except as affected by the\r\nirregular outline of its lake boundary on the north, and ranges 5 to\r\n9. It has seventy-five miles of lake shore, with some fine harbors,\r\nthe finest of which are those in the shelter of the Apostle islands,\r\non the northeast. The country is covered with dense growths of\r\nevergreen and hardwood timber. Numerous streams flow into the lake on\r\nthe north, and into the tributaries of the St. Croix on the south. The\r\nChippewa Indians formerly occupied the country. The Red Cliff Indian\r\nreservation is located at Buffalo Bay, a short distance north of\r\nBayfield City. The territory of Bayfield county has been successively\r\nin the bounds of Crawford, St. Croix and La Pointe. By subsequent\r\nsubdivisions Douglas and Ashland counties were set off from La Pointe,\r\nand the Apostle islands given to Ashland, and the remaining part of La\r\nPointe was organized as Bayfield county, with the county seat at\r\nBayfield, in 1868. Aside from traders and adventurers and the\r\noccasional advent of a missionary, the first settler was Elisha Pike,\r\nwho came with his family in 1855, and settled in section 21, township\r\n50, range 4, not far from Bayfield. Bayfield was named in honor of\r\nAdmiral Bayfield of the British Navy, who made a survey of Lake\r\nSuperior in 1822-23.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAYFIELD.\r\n\r\nThe village of Bayfield was platted in 1856, by H. M. Rice. It has\r\nsince been incorporated. It is beautifully situated. The site slopes\r\ngently from high timbered regions to the shores of the bay. The waters\r\nof the bay are deep, clear, and, from the shelter afforded by the\r\nApostle islands, almost unruffled. The harbor thus afforded is among\r\nthe best on the lake. Bayfield was made a port of entry in 1858. The\r\ncity is well supplied with stores, mills, hotels, school houses, and\r\nchurches. There are many pleasant homes, with fountains playing in\r\nfront, lawns, shade trees and ornamental shrubs. The landscape,\r\nespecially to those residing in the rear of the city on the higher\r\ngrounds, is exquisitely beautiful. There are many beautiful trout\r\nbrooks and ponds in the suburbs. As a summer resort Bayfield is\r\nbecoming every year better appreciated. The Bayfield _Press_,\r\nestablished in 1874, is the local newspaper. It is edited and\r\npublished by Currie C. Bell.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHBURN\r\n\r\nIs a new town on the west side of Chequamegon bay. It is the lake\r\nterminus of the Omaha railroad. It has a fine harbor, large mills and\r\nother enterprises that mark it as a growing town.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRUMMOND, PRATT AND MASON\r\n\r\nAre prosperous manufacturing villages, with large saw mills, located\r\non White river, on the line of the North Wisconsin railroad.\r\n\r\n\r\nCABLE STATION,\r\n\r\nOn the railroad, in township 43, range 7, contains about a dozen\r\nbuildings. Mathews, Olson & Co. are working a silver mine near Cable\r\nwhich yields twenty-three dollars per ton. There are several other\r\nvillages and stations on the line of the two railroads passing through\r\nthis county.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOUGLAS COUNTY.\r\n\r\nThis county occupies the extreme northwestern corner of the State,\r\nhaving a frontage of six townships on the lake by six on the Minnesota\r\nstate line, making a total of thirty-six whole townships and five\r\nfractional, the latter lying along the lake. The northern part of the\r\ncounty is drained by the tributaries of St. Louis river and Lake\r\nSuperior, the principal streams being the Nemadji, Middle and Brule\r\nrivers. The southern part is drained by the St. Croix and tributaries.\r\nThe Omaha railroad intersects the county from south to north, having\r\nits northern terminus at West Superior. The Northern Pacific crosses\r\nthe upper tier of towns, having its principal station at Superior.\r\nThriving villages are growing up along these lines of railroad, and\r\nthe county is being rapidly settled. It was organized as a county in\r\nFebruary, 1854, from territory originally belonging successively to\r\nCrawford, St. Croix and La Pointe counties.\r\n\r\nThe first election was held Nov. 7, 1854. The following officers were\r\nelected: County judge, J. A. Markland; sheriff, Asa A. Parker;\r\ndistrict attorney, R. R. Nelson; register of deeds, F. A. Whitaker;\r\ncounty treasurer, Bradley Salter; supervisors, Frank Perfect, Chas. H.\r\nKimball and Alexander Paul; supervisors' clerk, C. H. Kingsbury;\r\nsuperintendent of schools, J. J. Post; coroner, R. H. Barrett. Judge\r\nJ. A. Markland held the first term of court, June 4, 1854. The first\r\ndeed filed in the county was from William Herbert to Geo. L. Becker,\r\nbeing a warranty in section 14, township 47, range 14. Consideration,\r\n$250. The deed was recorded February, 1854. At the organization of the\r\ncounty, Superior was made the county seat.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPERIOR CITY.\r\n\r\nThe site is on a beautiful plateau originally covered with pine, lying\r\non the southern shore of Lake Superior, separated, however, from it by\r\nthe waters of Superior bay, a fine natural harbor shut in from the\r\nlake by tongues of land called Minnesota and Wisconsin Points. These\r\napproach within a half mile of each other, the space thus left being\r\nthe original outlet of the bay. Between Wisconsin Point and the main\r\nland lie the waters of Allouez bay, extending in length a distance of\r\nthree miles, and in width in its widest part about one mile. The\r\nNemadji river flows into Superior bay near its outlet. The bay of St.\r\nLouis finds an outlet into Superior bay between Rice's Point and a\r\ntongue of land a mile or more in length, projecting from the Wisconsin\r\nmain land. Minnesota Point, which separates Superior bay from Superior\r\nlake, is a strip of land seven miles in length, with an average width\r\nof seven hundred feet, beautifully fringed with pines. At the outlet\r\nof Superior bay two piers have been constructed, extending into the\r\nlake three-fourths of a mile. On one of these piers is a forty-day\r\nlighthouse, constructed by the government. The bay forms one of the\r\nfinest harbors in the world.\r\n\r\nThe plateau on which Superior City is located is about thirty-five\r\nfeet above the waters of the bay. The site occupies the triangular\r\nspace lying between St. Louis bay and the bays of Allouez and\r\nSuperior, and has at least eleven miles of frontage on these bays,\r\nalong which numerous docks and piers have been built and projected,\r\nsome of them costing as much as $200,000. The government surveys were\r\nmade in 1853, by George R. Stuntz. In July of the same year J.\r\nAddison Bulmer made a location on Allouez Point. In August, John T.\r\nMorgan settled at the mouth of the Nemadji river. They were followed\r\nby Wm. H. Newton, George E. Nettleton, Benjamin Thompson, Col. D. A.\r\nRobertson, R. R. Nelson, and D. A. J. Baker, of St. Paul. In September\r\nthe Roy brothers and ---- Cadott came. The same autumn Frank Roy,\r\nAbraham Emmuit and Louis Souvenard made pre-emptions of frontage on\r\nSuperior bay. Several buildings were erected. Mr. Roy and others give\r\nto Col. Robertson the honor of building the first house in Superior.\r\nIt is still standing.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1853 mineral explorations were made, and mines were\r\nworked during the ensuing winter. An Indian trail was widened and a\r\nroad opened into the St. Croix valley by which supplies were brought\r\nfrom St. Paul. This road was not wide enough for wagons, but was\r\ntraveled during the winter in dog sledges and on snowshoes. The winter\r\nfollowing the opening of the road, Messrs. Robertson, Nelson and Baker\r\nwent over it to St. Paul on foot. In the spring of 1854 Newton and\r\nothers made additional surveys of the town site of Superior City, and\r\nthe same was recorded Nov. 6, 1854. Settlers came in rapidly. O. K.\r\nHall built a hotel. At the organization of Douglas county, in 1854,\r\nSuperior was made the county seat, the proprietors donating twelve\r\nacres of land for county buildings. Two lots for every eight blocks\r\nwere donated for schools, twenty lots for churches, and a square for a\r\npark. A weekly mail to and from St. Paul was established in July of\r\nthat year. A saw mill was erected. A land office was established at\r\nSuperior that year. Rev. David Brooks, a pioneer Methodist minister,\r\npreached the first sermon, using a carpenter's shop as an audience\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nAn old settlers' association was organized September, 1855, known as\r\nthe Fond du Lac Historical Society. Its officers were: R. B. Carlton,\r\npresident; W. H. Norton and E. F. Ely, vice presidents; E. W. Perry,\r\nsecretary. The Superior _Chronicle_ issued its first number June 12,\r\n1855. It was the first newspaper published at the head of Lake\r\nSuperior. Ashton & Wise were the publishers. The second number\r\ncontained the announcement of the opening of the Ste. Marie canal and\r\nthe passage through it of the first boat, the steamer Illinois. It\r\ncontained also the astonishing announcement, from the St. Anthony\r\n_Express_, that a salt lake had been discovered by W. H. Ingersoll,\r\none hundred and fifty miles west of St. Cloud. The salt was said to\r\nbe of good quality, and in such quantity that it could be gathered by\r\nthe bushel. Large beds of coal had also been discovered near the lake.\r\nThe _Chronicle_ was discontinued in 1863 and succeeded by the Superior\r\n_Gazette_ in 1864. The _Gazette_ has been succeeded by the Superior\r\n_Times_, now edited by J. Lute, Thomas Bardon, proprietor.\r\n\r\nSuperior City has passed through periods of depression as well as of\r\nadvancement. At an early period speculators were lured to the spot by\r\nthe manifest advantages it presented for the building of a great city.\r\nThe favorable site attracted attention throughout the Union. Wealthy\r\nmen and men prominent in the political history of the country invested\r\nlargely. Amongst these we find the names of W. W. Corcoran, of\r\nWashington; Robert J. Walker, of New York; G. W. Cass, of Pittsburgh,\r\nPennsylvania; Horace S. Walbridge, of Toledo, Ohio; the Breckenridges\r\nof Kentucky; the Rice brothers, of St. Paul; and James Stinson, of\r\nChicago. With the influence of these names, and the means furnished,\r\nthe new city had a rapid, if not healthy growth. The prosperity was\r\nshort lived. The adjacent country was not sufficiently developed, the\r\nshipping interests languished, and those who had been attracted hither\r\nby dreams of becoming suddenly rich, were discouraged and moved away,\r\ntill, in 1858, the city was half deserted. The period of depression\r\ncontinued through the Civil War, and for years afterward, until, by\r\nthe building of railroads and the consequent development of the\r\ncountry, the claims of Superior as a centre of trade were again\r\nacknowledged, and the tide of emigration was turned back. With\r\nAllouez, Superior and Duluth bays for its harbor, with its railroads\r\nalready built, building or projected, its enterprising people are\r\nready to contest with Duluth for the sovereignty of the Unsalted Seas.\r\n\r\nSuperior, being a combination of Old Superior and West Superior under\r\none municipality, was organized as a village Aug. 27, 1887, and held\r\nher first village election Sept. 24, 1887, with a population of 6,000\r\npeople. It was organized with the following officers: President, L. F.\r\nJohnston; trustees, Wm. Munro, Neil Smith, L. G. Moran, A. Lederman,\r\nA. A. Cross, and Howard Thomas.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEST SUPERIOR\r\n\r\nWas platted in 1884. The first buildings were erected in October of\r\nthe same year. The city has now a population of 3,000. It has\r\nexcellent graded schools, under the supervision of Prof. G. Glen\r\nWilliams. The Catholics, Presbyterians and Congregationalists have\r\nchurch buildings, and the Methodists are about to build. A hotel is in\r\nprocess of building that will cost when completed $100,000. West\r\nSuperior is supplied with water works, the electric light, extensive\r\ncoal docks and elevators, and has three newspapers, the Superior\r\n_Inter-Ocean_, established June 3, 1886; the West Superior _News_,\r\nestablished June 24, 1886; and the _Sunday Morning Call_, established\r\nJuly, 1887.\r\n\r\nTHE BARDON BROTHERS.--James, Thomas and John A. Bardon came early to\r\nSuperior City and upheld her doubtful fortunes in the days of trial,\r\nnever losing faith in her prospective greatness. They have not toiled\r\nand watched and waited in vain. The expected railways have been built;\r\nthe improved harbor, with dredge boats, well built piers and\r\nlighthouse, has been completed. Surveys and terminal approaches of\r\nother roads insure the commercial prosperity of the city. Thomas has\r\nfor some years been a resident of Ashland, Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nWM. H. NEWTON, an early citizen of Superior City, is among those who\r\nhave never lost faith in its future prosperity, believing the head of\r\nthe lake to be the natural terminus of European trade and a centre of\r\nAmerican commerce. He is an engineer, surveyor, real estate dealer,\r\nand is interested in some of the converging lines of railroad at\r\nSuperior City.\r\n\r\nSOLON H. CLOUGH.--Mr. Clough was born in Madison county, New York,\r\nAug. 31, 1828; was educated at Fulton Academy, since known as Falley\r\nSeminary, Oswego county, New York. He attended for a short time\r\nHamilton College, New York, studied law, and was admitted to the bar\r\nat Syracuse in 1851. He came to Hudson, Wisconsin, in the fall of\r\n1857; in 1861 was elected mayor of Hudson; in 1864, judge of the\r\nEleventh circuit, and removed to Osceola. In 1869 he removed to\r\nSuperior City; in 1876 returned to Hudson, but removed again to\r\nSuperior in 1881, where he still resides. He was re-elected circuit\r\njudge in 1870, and in 1882 was appointed by Gov. Rusk to fill the\r\nvacancy caused by the death of Judge Barron. At the conclusion of his\r\nterm he was re-elected for the ensuing term. Judge Clough was married\r\nin 1851 to Kate Taylor, of New York.\r\n\r\nVINCENT ROY, a brother of Peter Roy, well known among the pioneers of\r\nthe Northwest, was born in Fort Francis in 1825; came to La Pointe in\r\n1839; attended school a few terms, and engaged in the fur trade. In\r\n1854 he came to Superior, where he still resides, and is an active,\r\nenterprising merchant.\r\n\r\nD. GEORGE MORRISON, a son of William Morrison, the discoverer of the\r\nsource of the Mississippi, resides at Superior City, where he has\r\nserved as register of deeds for Douglas county since 1856, a period of\r\nthirty-one years. He came to Superior an 1854.\r\n\r\nAUGUST ZACHAU came to Superior in 1852, from Chicago, where he had\r\nbeen for three years, working at the carpenter's trade. He was then\r\ntwenty-seven years of age, and a Prussian by birth. He was engaged by\r\nthe Superior Town Site Company to superintend the building\r\nimprovements going on at what is now the East End. When he came up, no\r\nSte. Marie canal had been dug, and a portage was necessary between\r\nLakes Superior and Huron, involving a change in the line of vessels.\r\nHe built the first hotel in Superior, the old Pioneer House, which\r\nburned in 1857, and also the present Nicollet House, which was built\r\nof logs, cut on what is now Tower Slip. He also built the Quebec pier,\r\nthe first dock ever built at the head of Lake Superior. He also\r\nassisted in cutting the old government trail through to the St. Croix\r\nriver. He was an active participant in the defense of the town site\r\npeople in their battles with the claim jumping pre-emptioners, who had\r\nsettled on the lands adjoining, and who filed contests on much of the\r\ntown site as soon as the plats were returned to the land office at\r\nWillow River, now known as Hudson. In cutting the sixty miles of trail\r\nto the St. Croix, every able-bodied man turned out, except enough to\r\nguard the homes and cut kindling wood. The axemen ground their axes at\r\nFond du Lac, the only trading station of importance at that time on\r\nthe St. Louis river. He pre-empted, in the interest of his fellow\r\nsufferers on the town site, eighty acres of land, now part of\r\nSuperior. He has always led a quiet, laborious life; now runs a small\r\ngeneral store at the East End, and does a little general contracting\r\nfor ties and bridge timbers and dock piling. He has a family of five\r\nboys and one girl now living, all in Superior.\r\n\r\nAmong the first settlers were Judge Hiram Hayes, ---- Ritchie and ----\r\nGates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nPINE COUNTY.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrior to the organization of Minnesota Territory, in 1849, Pine county\r\nwas included within the limits of St. Croix county, Wisconsin. Until\r\nthe organization of Chisago county, in 1852, it was within the limits\r\nof Ramsey, and from thence until 1854, within the limits of Chisago,\r\nwhen it was organized under its present name. Until 1858 it included\r\nthe territory of the present counties of Kanabec and Carlton. It is\r\nbounded on the north by Carlton county, on the east by the St. Croix\r\nriver and the state line, and on the west by Aitkin and Kanabec\r\ncounties. It is well watered by the St. Croix, Kettle and Kanabec\r\nrivers with their numerous tributaries. There are many fine lakes\r\nwithin its borders. The finest of these are Cross, Pokegama, Pine and\r\nSturgeon lakes. This county was originally heavily timbered with pine,\r\nfrom which fact it derived its name. Though immense quantities have\r\nbeen removed, the supply is still great enough to make this region a\r\nlumberman's paradise for years to come.\r\n\r\nThe facilities for floating logs to the St. Croix are scarce equaled\r\nelsewhere. Since 1837 the Kanabec river has been a principal feeder to\r\nthe lumber trade of the St. Croix valley. In some of the forests a new\r\ngrowth has succeeded the old, and should the land be not otherwise\r\nused, the lumberman may yet reap successive harvests in periods\r\nranging from eight to fifteen years. Much of the land in this county\r\nis well adapted for agriculture. The soil is chiefly a sandy loam with\r\nclay subsoil. Much of the county will eventually become a good grazing\r\nand cereal growing region. The southern townships are heavily timbered\r\nwith hardwood and are rapidly being converted into good wheat farms. A\r\nlarge quantity of cordwood, piles and ties is annually marketed by\r\nmeans of the railroad. Kanabec river is navigable from Chengwatana and\r\nPine City to Brunswick, in Kanabec county. The same steamboat that\r\nsince 1881 has navigated the Kanabec, also makes trips, six miles up\r\nthe Rice and Pokegama rivers. The first crops raised in the county,\r\nexcept those raised by traders and missionaries, were raised on the\r\nGreeley farm, Kanabec river, near the western limits of the county, by\r\nRoyal C. Gray.\r\n\r\nAt the organization of the county, Herman Trott, George W. Staples and\r\nRoyal C. Gray were appointed commissioners. The county was attached\r\nfor judicial purposes to Chisago until 1872, at which date the county\r\nseat, located at Chengwatana by legislative enactment, was changed by\r\na popular vote to Pine City. The first district court was held in\r\nOctober, 1872, Judge Crosby, presiding; John D. Wilcox, clerk; Edward\r\nJackson, sheriff.\r\n\r\nThe first marriage license, issued in 1872, was to John Kelsey and\r\nMary Hoffman. The first board of county officers, after the removal of\r\nthe county seat, were: Commissioners, Hiram Brackett, George Goodwin\r\nand Edward Jackson; auditor, Adolph Munch; register of deeds, Don\r\nWillard; county attorney, treasurer and superintendent of schools,\r\nJohn D. Wilcox. The first article recorded by the register of Pine\r\ncounty was a military land warrant, No. 12702, in the name of Prudence\r\nRockwell, located by William Orrin Baker upon the southeast quarter of\r\nsection 32, township 38, range 20, subject to forty days' pre-emption,\r\ndated Stillwater, June 19, 1855; T. M. Fullerton, register. Assigned,\r\nJune 14, 1856, to Enos Jones. The second record is of a warranty deed\r\nfrom John F. Bradford to W. A. Van Slyke, of Ramsey county, of the\r\nwest half of the northwest quarter of section 30, township 39, range\r\n19, and the west half of the northwest quarter of the same section.\r\n\r\nThe finances of the county were in good condition until 1872, from\r\nwhich time, owing to heavy expenditures for new roads, with possibly\r\ninjudicious management, and two defalcations of county auditors,\r\nconsiderable embarrassment ensued. In 1876 the state legislature\r\nbonded the county indebtedness of $10,000, in ten year bonds, at ten\r\nper cent interest. These bonds were readily received by the creditors,\r\nand the county is now free from debt. During the last year a bridge\r\n800 feet long was built across the Kanabec river near Pine City, at a\r\ncost of $3,350, for which the State appropriated $1,500 and the county\r\n$1,850.\r\n\r\nThe Lake Superior & Mississippi railroad was completed to Kanabec\r\nriver in 1868, and in 1869 extended northwest to the county line. The\r\nbuilding of this road was speedily followed by the erection of\r\nnumerous mills along its line, a list of which is appended, with the\r\nvery remarkable statistics of the losses by fire, from which but four\r\nof these mills were exempt:\r\n\r\n     North Branch, Swenson & Co., flour mill; burned; loss,\r\n     $8,000.\r\n\r\n     Rush City, Taylor & Co., capacity 1,000,000 feet yearly;\r\n     burned; loss, $3,000.\r\n\r\n     Rock Creek, Edgerton & Co., capacity 2,000,000 feet yearly;\r\n     burned; loss, $8,000; rebuilt.\r\n\r\n     Rock Creek, Strong & Co., capacity 1,000,000 feet yearly;\r\n     burned; loss, $1,500; rebuilt.\r\n\r\n     Rock Creek, Long & Co., capacity 1,000,000 feet yearly;\r\n     removed.\r\n\r\n     Pine City, Ferson & Co., capacity 10,000,000 feet yearly;\r\n     burned; loss, $50,000; rebuilt.\r\n\r\n     Pine City, Ferson & Co., capacity 10,000,000 feet yearly;\r\n     burned; loss, $25,000; rebuilt.\r\n\r\n     Pine City, Munch & Burrows, stave mill; burned; loss,\r\n     $10,000.\r\n\r\n     Pine City, Brackett & Co., capacity 3,000,000 feet yearly.\r\n\r\n     Mission Creek, Taylor & Co., capacity 3,000,000 feet yearly;\r\n     burned; loss, $12,500; rebuilt.\r\n\r\n     Mission Creek, Taylor & Co., capacity 3,000,000 feet yearly;\r\n     burned; loss, $12,500.\r\n\r\n     Hinckley, Grant & Co., capacity 1,000,000 feet yearly;\r\n     burned; loss, $3,000.\r\n\r\n     Hinckley, McKean & Butler, capacity 3,000,000 feet yearly;\r\n     burned; loss, $7,000; rebuilt.\r\n\r\n     Miller Station, Robie & Co., shingle mill; burned; loss,\r\n     $3,000.\r\n\r\n     Kettle River, S. S. Griggs & Co., capacity 3,000,000 feet\r\n     yearly; never operated; loss, $5,000.\r\n\r\n     Moose Lake, McArthur & Co., capacity 2,000,000 feet yearly;\r\n     burned; loss, $30,000.\r\n\r\n     Barnum, Cooley & Co., capacity 1,000,000 feet yearly;\r\n     burned; loss, $5,000.\r\n\r\n     Barnum, Bliss & Co., capacity 10,000,000 feet yearly.\r\n\r\n     Northern Pacific Junction, Payne & Co., two mills burned;\r\n     loss, $50,000; rebuilt the third time.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOKEGAMA LAKE.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful lake lies in township 39, range 22. It is about five\r\nmiles in length by one in breadth and finds an outlet in Kanabec\r\nriver. It is celebrated for its historical associations. Thomas\r\nConner, an old trader, informed the writer of these sketches, in 1847,\r\nthat he had had a trading post on the banks of this lake thirty years\r\nbefore, or about the year 1816. This was before Fort Snelling was\r\nbuilt. Mr. Conner said that there was a French trading post at\r\nPokegama long before he went there. It was in the spring of 1847,\r\nafter a wearisome day's tramp, that I made his acquaintance and shared\r\nhis unstinted hospitality. His post, at that time, was located at the\r\nmouth of Goose creek, Chisago county, on the banks of the St. Croix.\r\nHis rude, portable house was built of bark, subdivided with mats and\r\nskins into different apartments. Although at an advanced period in\r\nlife, his mind was clear and he conversed with a degree of\r\nintelligence which caused me to ask him why he lived thus secluded,\r\naway from all the privileges of a civilized life. His reasons, some of\r\nthem, were forcible; he liked the quiet of the wilderness, away from\r\nthe turmoils of the envious white race. I learned from him many\r\ninteresting facts connected with travelers, traders and explorers of\r\nour St. Croix valley. This was the last season he spent on the river.\r\n\r\nIn 1847, when I visited Pokegama, Jeremiah Russell, an Indian farmer,\r\nhad a very pretty farm on a point of land on the southwest side of the\r\nlake, and between the lake and the river. A Frenchman, Jarvis, lived a\r\nshort distance from Russell. Across the lake from Russell's were the\r\nneat and tasteful log buildings and gardens of the Presbyterian\r\nmission. The mission was established in the spring of 1836, by Rev.\r\nFrederic Ayer and his associates, under the auspicies of the American\r\nBoard of Foreign Missions. Mr. Ayer had been laboring at Yellow Lake\r\nmission, but, owing to the growing unfriendliness of the Indians, had\r\nbeen removed to Pokegama. Much pertaining to the mission work, both at\r\nPokegama and elsewhere, will be found in the biographies of the\r\nprincipal missionaries. We mention here only such incidents as may be\r\nof more general interest. For many of these incidents we are indebted\r\nto Mrs. Elisabeth J. Ayer, of Belle Prairie, the widow of Rev.\r\nFrederic Ayer, for a long time missionary to the Ojibways. This\r\nestimable lady has passed her eighty-fifth year, but her mind is still\r\nclear and her hand steady, her manuscript having the appearance of the\r\nwork of a precise young schoolmistress. She mentions an old Canadian,\r\nwho had been in the country sixty years, and for seven or eight years\r\nhad been entirely blind. He was known as Mushk-de-winini\r\n(The-old-blind-prairie-man), also the old trader, Thomas Conner, the\r\nremains of whose mud chimney and foundation of the old trading house\r\nmay still be seen on the southern shore of the lake.\r\n\r\nFranklin Steele was the first white man to visit the mission. In the\r\nspring of 1837 the mission aided three or four families in building.\r\nFebruary, 1837, Rev. Mr. Hall, of the La Pointe mission, visited\r\nPokegama, and organized a church of seven members,--three of whom were\r\nnatives,--administered the ordinance of baptism to eight persons, and\r\nsolemnized two marriages, probably the first in the valley of the St.\r\nCroix. Revs. Boutwell and Ely came to the mission in 1837. A school\r\nhad been opened, some Indian houses built, and gardens enlarged, and\r\nthe future of the mission seemed assured. Mrs. Ayer relates the\r\nfollowing account of the\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF POKEGAMA.\r\n\r\nIn 1811 the Sioux selected this settlement as the place to avenge the\r\nwrongs of the Ojibways--some of recent date; the principal of which\r\nwas the killing of two sons of Little Crow (done in self defense)\r\nbetween Pokegama and the falls of the St. Croix. The Sioux arrived at\r\nPokegama in the night, and stopped on the opposite side of the lake,\r\ntwo miles from the mission. The main body went to the main settlement,\r\nand, after examining the ground where they intended to operate, hid\r\namong the trees and brush back of the Indian gardens, with orders that\r\nall keep quiet on both sides of the lake till a given signal, when the\r\nIndians were busy in their gardens, and then make quick work. But\r\ntheir plans failed. Most of the Ojibways of the settlement had, from\r\nfear of the Sioux, slept on an island half a mile out in the lake (I\r\nmean the women and children), and were late to their gardens. In the\r\nmeantime a loaded canoe was nearing the opposite shore and the few\r\nSioux who had remained there to dispatch any who, in time of battle,\r\nmight attempt to escape by crossing over, fired prematurely. This gave\r\nthe alarm, and saved the Ojibways. The chief ran to Mr. Ayer's door\r\nand said, expressively: \"The Sioux are upon us,\" and was off. The\r\nIndians seemed at once to understand that the main body of the enemy\r\nwas at hand. The missionaries stepped out of the door and had just\r\ntime to see a great splashing of water across the lake when bullets\r\ncame whizzing about their ears, and they went in. The Sioux had left\r\ntheir hiding place and the battle commenced in earnest. Most of the\r\nwomen and children of the settlement were yet on the island. The house\r\nof the chief was well barricaded and most of the men gathered in\r\nthere. The remainder took refuge in a house more exposed, at the other\r\nend of the village. The enemy drew up very near and fired in at the\r\nwindow. One gun was made useless, being indented by a ball. The owner\r\nretired to a corner and spent the time in prayer. The mother of the\r\nhouse, with her small children, was on her way to the island under a\r\nshower of bullets, calling aloud on God for help.\r\n\r\nThe missionaries seeing from their windows quantities of bloody flesh\r\nupon stumps in the battle field, thought surely that several of their\r\nfriends had fallen. It proved to be a cow and calf of an Ojibway. The\r\nmission children were much frightened and asked many questions, and\r\nfor apparent safety went up stairs and were put behind some well\r\nfilled barrels. In the heat of battle two Ojibways came from the\r\nisland and landed in front of Mr. Ayer's house. They drew their canoe\r\nashore and secreted themselves as well as the surroundings would\r\npermit. Not long after three Sioux ran down the hill and toward the\r\ncanoe. They were fired upon and one fell dead. The other two ran for\r\nhelp but before they could return the Ojibways were on the way back to\r\nthe island. Not having time to take the scalp of their enemy, they\r\nhastily cut the powder horn strap from his breast, dripping with\r\nblood, as a trophy of victory. The Sioux drew the dead body up the\r\nhill and back to the place of fighting. The noise ceased. The battle\r\nwas over. The missionaries soon heard the joyful words, quietly\r\nspoken: \"We still live.\" Not a warrior had fallen. The two school\r\ngirls who were in the canoe at the first firing in the morning were\r\nthe only ones killed, though half the men and boys in the fight were\r\nwounded. The Sioux women and boys who had come with their warriors to\r\ncarry away the spoils had the chagrin of returning as empty as they\r\ncame.\r\n\r\nThe Ojibways were careful that no canoe should be left within reach of\r\nthe Sioux. From necessity they took a canoe, made by Mr. Ely, and\r\nremoved their dead two miles up the river, dressed them (seemingly) in\r\nthe best the party could furnish, with each a double barreled gun, a\r\ntomahawk and scalping knife, set them up against some large trees and\r\nwent on their way. Some of these articles, including their\r\nhead-dresses, were sent to the museum of the American board, in\r\nBoston.\r\n\r\nIn the closing scene the missionaries had the opportunity of seeing\r\nthe difference between those Indians who had listened to instruction\r\nand those who had not. The second day after the battle the pagan party\r\nbrought back to the island the dead bodies of their enemies, cut in\r\npieces, and distributed parts to such Ojibways as had at any time lost\r\nfriends by the hands of the Sioux. One woman, whose daughter was\r\nkilled and mutilated on that memorable morning, when she saw the\r\ncanoes coming, with a head raised high in the air on a long pole,\r\nwaded out into the water, grabbed it like a hungry dog and dashed it\r\nrepeatedly on the stones with savage fierceness. Others of the pagans\r\nconducted themselves in a similar manner. They even cooked some of the\r\nflesh that night in their kettles of rice. Eunice (as she was named at\r\nher baptism) was offered an arm. At first she hesitated; but for\r\nreasons, sufficient in her own mind, thought best to take it. Her\r\ndaughter-in-law, widow of her son who had recently been killed and\r\nchopped into pieces by the Sioux, took another, and they went into\r\ntheir lodge. Eunice said: \"My daughter, we must not do as some of our\r\nfriends are doing. We have been taught better,\" and taking some white\r\ncloths from her sack they wrapped the arms in them, offered a prayer,\r\nand gave them a decent burial. About this time a Mr. Kirkland was sent\r\nfrom Quincy, Illinois, by a party who wished to plant a colony not far\r\nfrom the mission station. He arrived at Pokegama very soon after the\r\nbattle. Notwithstanding what had happened he selected a location on\r\nCross lake, just where a railroad has now been in operation for some\r\nyears. He worked vigorously for two or three weeks, and then went to\r\nconsult the Indian agent and the military at Fort Snelling. They gave\r\nhim no encouragement that the two tribes would ever live in peace; and\r\nhe went home. The Ojibways lived in constant fear, and the place was\r\nsoon deserted. This was a great trial to the missionaries; but they\r\ndid not urge them to stay. They separated into small parties and went\r\nwhere they could get a living for the present and be out of danger.\r\nThe teachers remained at their post, occasionally visiting the Indians\r\nin their retreat, hoping they might soon think it safe to return to\r\ntheir homes. In this they were disappointed. These visits were not\r\nalways very safe. On one of these trips Mr. Ayer was lost, and from\r\ncold and hunger came near perishing. Not finding the party he sought,\r\nhe wandered about for a day or two. In the meantime the weather became\r\nmuch colder. Not expecting to camp out he took only one blanket and\r\nfood enough for one meal. In crossing Kettle river on a self-made\r\nconveyance, and there being ice on the opposite shore, he got wet. The\r\nIndians, anticipating his visit, had sent a young man to the mission\r\nstation to guide him to, their new locality. He returned in haste,\r\nfell on Mr. Ayer's track, and a light sprinkle of snow enabled him to\r\nfollow it until he was found.\r\n\r\nMrs. Ayer relates several incidents illustrative of Indian character.\r\nAs her husband had been stationed at Yellow Lake, and afterward at Red\r\nLake, these incidents are not necessarily located at Pokegama:\r\n\r\n\r\nA NOBLE CHIEF.\r\n\r\nThe Red Lake Indians were a noble band--they had a noble chief. In\r\ncivilization he led the way, in religion he did not oppose. He\r\nshouldered a heavy axe, and could be seen chopping on one side of a\r\nlarge tree, in perspiration, while his wife was on the other side,\r\nhelping all she could with her hatchet. This chief was also an\r\nadvocate of temperance. Not that he didn't love whisky, but he hated\r\nthe effect of it on his band. He dictated a letter to the president,\r\nbegging him not to let the white faces bring any more firewater to his\r\npeople, giving as one reason that they had teachers among them who\r\nmust be protected, and if they had whisky he did not know what might\r\nhappen.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANK CONFESSIONS.\r\n\r\nIn the church there was much childish simplicity. Once when Mr. Ayer\r\nwas lecturing on the eighth commandment, he paused, and without\r\nexpecting an answer, said: \"Now who is there among you who has not\r\nstolen?\" One woman began to confess--another followed, then another.\r\nOne thought she had stolen about seven times. Another entered more\r\ninto particulars, mentioning the things she had stolen, till the scene\r\nwas quite amusing. Another rose to confess, but was cut short by her\r\nhusband, who said: \"Who knows how many times he has stolen? We are a\r\nnation of thieves.\" And with a few remarks the meeting closed.\r\n\r\n\r\nA COWARDLY DEED.\r\n\r\nAfter a medicine dance, according to Indian custom, they proposed a\r\nfeast, but there was nothing on which to feast. There was a large\r\ncompany and all were hungry. Mr. Ayer's cow was in the barnyard near.\r\nThree daring fellows sitting by themselves began to taunt each other\r\nin regard to their comparative prowess. After an excitement was\r\ncreated, one of them, to show his bravery, shot the cow. Mr. Ayer was\r\nin his garden and witnessed the performance. Two or three of the\r\nleading men in this pagan party came immediately to Mr. Ayer to learn\r\nwhether he would take the cow for his own use. While they were talking\r\n(perhaps twenty minutes) the cow was cut in pieces, and in the\r\nIndians' kettles preparatory to a good time. After the Indians had\r\nsold their land they paid for the cow.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN UNJUST ACCUSATION.\r\n\r\nIndians are said to be revengeful. They are. So are white men. They\r\nfight for their rights. So do white men. They are thieves and liars.\r\nSo are white men. Quarrelsome, envious, jealous. So are white men.\r\nExperience teaches that according to their knowledge they compare\r\nfavorably with Anglo-Saxons. Sin is none the better, nor less\r\nmischievous, for being civilized.\r\n\r\nA missionary, a good man, too, he was, accused an innocent woman of\r\nstealing his shirts that were laid out on the snow to whiten. His\r\nwife, not remembering that she had brought them in early in the\r\nmorning, asked him to go out and get them. But they were not to be\r\nfound! \"Who has been here this morning?\" was asked. \"Ekwazans; I don't\r\nremember any other.\" \"Well, she shan't have those shirts. I'll\r\novertake her before she gets home.\" He followed her four miles,\r\ndetermined to have his shirts. The woman declared her innocence, and\r\ntold him to search the wigwam. He did so, but said himself that it was\r\ndone rather roughly. In the meantime the wife espied the shirts just\r\nwhere she had put them. This affair was ever after a source of regret\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nSome of the Indians laughed heartily; others made remarks rather\r\nsarcastic. The woman herself felt disgraced by the accusation, but\r\nnever manifested signs of wanting to \"pay back,\" or in any way to\r\navenge the wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIAN MAGNANIMITY.\r\n\r\nAn employe of the American Fur Company, a \"green hand,\" was crossing a\r\nportage. The load on his back was topped off with a bag of flour. The\r\nhill was steep and long. Steps were cut in it like a flight of stairs.\r\nAs he reached the top a mischievous Indian touched the bag, and it\r\nwent tumbling to the foot of the hill. The Frenchman immediately sent\r\nthe Indian tumbling after it. Some of the company advised the\r\nFrenchman to run away, for the Indian might kill him. He told them\r\nboldly that he would not run away. The Indian gathered himself up,\r\ncame to the top of the hill, told the Frenchman he had done just\r\nright, offered his hand and they were firm friends. Magnanimous had it\r\nbeen a white man.\r\n\r\nREV. FREDERIC AYER was born in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, in 1803.\r\nWhen he was two years old the family moved to Central New York. His\r\nfather was a Presbyterian minister, and they intended that their son\r\nshould follow the same profession; but before he was prepared his\r\nhealth failed and he turned his attention to other business.\r\n\r\nHe commenced his labors for the Indians in 1829, by teaching the\r\nmission school at Mackinaw, under the superintendency of Rev. M.\r\nFerry. The pupils of this school were not all Ojibways but were from\r\nmany different tribes, and spoke different languages. Mackinaw was\r\nthen a general depot of the North American fur traders. They brought\r\nnot only their own children to the school but such others as parents\r\namong whom they were trading wished to send. They were gathered from\r\nLake Winnipeg, British America north, to Prairie du Chien and the head\r\nof Lake Michigan south. They were taught in English only.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1830 Mr. Ayer went to La Pointe, Lake Superior, with\r\nMr. Warren, opened a school and commenced the study of the Ojibway\r\nlanguage. In 1831 he met at Mackinaw, Revs. Hall and Boutwell, who\r\nwere sent out by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign\r\nMissions to the Indians, and he returned with Mr. and Mrs. Hall and\r\ntheir interpreter to spend another winter at La Pointe.\r\n\r\nThe next year, 1832, Mr. Ayer wintered with another trader at Sandy\r\nLake. He opened a school there and completed a little Ojibway\r\nspelling book which was commenced at La Pointe. In the spring of 1833\r\nhe left Sandy Lake for Utica, New York, to get the book printed. Mr.\r\nAitkin, with whom he had wintered, gave him eighty dollars, and with a\r\npack on his back and an experienced guide, he started on his journey.\r\nBefore they reached Sault Ste. Marie the ice on Lake Superior was so\r\nweak that Mr. Ayer broke through and was saved only by carrying\r\nhorizontally in his hands a long pole to prevent his sinking.\r\n\r\nMr. Ayer hastened on to complete the object of his journey, that he\r\nmight return to Mackinaw in time to go up Lake Superior with the\r\ntraders. Mr. Ayer, hitherto an independent worker, now put himself\r\nunder the direction of the \"American Board,\" and was sent to Yellow\r\nLake, within the present bounds of Burnett county, Wisconsin. Miss\r\nDelia Cooke, whose name should never be forgotten among the early\r\nmissionaries of the American board to the Indians, and Miss Hester\r\nCrooks, a girl educated at Mackinaw, and who had some experience in\r\nteaching, were among the number who coasted up Lake Superior in a\r\nMackinaw boat; the former to La Pointe mission, the latter to Yellow\r\nLake with Mr. and Mrs. Ayer. They wintered in Dr. Borup's family. Mrs.\r\nBorup also had, for some years, been a pupil at Mackinaw. The next\r\nyear Miss Crooks married Rev. Mr. Boutwell and went to Leech lake, and\r\nJ. L. Seymour and Miss Sabrian Stevens, also Henry Blatchford, an\r\ninterpreter from Mackinaw, were added to Yellow Lake mission. When Mr.\r\nAyer told the Indians his object in coming among them, they gave him a\r\nwelcome. But six months later, seeing two or three log houses in\r\nprocess of building, they were much troubled, and met in a body to\r\nrequest him to go away. A Menomonie from the region of Green Bay had\r\nstirred them up, not against the missionaries, but against the general\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThe speaker said: \"It makes the Indians sad to see the white man's\r\nhouse go up on their land. We don't want you to stay; you must go.\"\r\nFurther on he said: \"You shall go!\" Mr. Ayer answered him. The party\r\nleft at midnight, and the missionaries went to bed with heavy hearts,\r\nthinking they might be thurst out almost immediately. But before\r\nsunrise the next morning about two-thirds of the same party returned,\r\nand said they had come to take back what they said the night before.\r\nThe war chief was speaker, but his words were mild. \"Why,\" said he,\r\n\"should we turn these teachers away before they have done us any\r\nharm?\" They would like to have us stay, he said, but added that they\r\ndid not want any more to come, for the result might be the loss of\r\ntheir lands. We might use whatever their country afforded, but they\r\nwould not give us any land, or sell us any. \"For,\" said the speaker,\r\n\"if we should sell our land where would our children play?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Ayer finished his school house, and went on with his work as\r\nthough nothing had happened. But evidently things were not as they\r\nshould be. The chief seemed to \"sit on the fence,\" ready to jump\r\neither way. The war chief was always friendly, but he had not so much\r\ncontrol over what concerned us. He did what he could without giving\r\noffense, and was anxious that his daughter of fourteen years should be\r\ntaken into the mission family. Mr. Ayer remained two years longer at\r\nYellow Lake. In the meantime the chief of the Snake River band sent\r\nmessages inviting the teachers to come and live among them.\r\nAccordingly in the spring of 1836 the mission was removed to Pokegama\r\nlake, eighteen miles up the river. The chief did all he had promised,\r\nand showed himself a man. Nothing was said here to remind the\r\nmissionaries that they were using the Indians' wood, water and fish.\r\nOn the contrary, when they sold their land, it was urged that the\r\nteachers' children should be enrolled for annual payment, the same as\r\ntheir own. The chief said that as they were born on the land it was no\r\nmore than right, and he wished it might be done.\r\n\r\nIn 1842 Mr. Ayer went with his family to the States; and in Oberlin\r\nwas ordained preacher to the Ojibways. He soon returned to the Indian\r\ncountry, and David Brainard Spencer, an Oberlin student, with him.\r\nThey spent the winter of 1842-3 in traveling from one trading post to\r\nanother, selecting locations for missionary labor. For their own field\r\nthey chose Red Lake. When Mrs. Ayer, with her two little boys, six and\r\neight years old, went to join her husband at the new station, Alonzo\r\nBarnard and wife and S. G. Wright, all of Oberlin College, went with\r\nher. Other missionaries soon followed, and that station was for many\r\nyears supplied with efficient laborers. More recently the work there\r\nwas assigned to Bishop Whipple, and is still carried on.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Ayer, in 1865, offered their services to the freed-men of\r\nthe South and were employed at Atlanta, Georgia.\r\n\r\nMr. Ayer organized a Congregational church and a baptistry connected\r\nwith the house of worship, that he might baptise by immersion or\r\notherwise, according to the wishes of the candidate. He also formed a\r\ntemperance society, which some months before his death numbered more\r\nthan six hundred members.\r\n\r\nThere was great grief at his death amongst all classes. An aged man,\r\nwho had lost a small fortune in his devotion to the Confederacy,\r\nembraced the corpse, and said: \"If he had not holpen me, I should have\r\nbefore gone him.\" Many others, in word or action, expressed a similar\r\nfeeling. All classes of people were represented at his funeral. His\r\nremains were buried in the Atlanta cemetery, Oct. 1, 1867. Thus passed\r\naway one who had spent a life for the benefit of others.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Ayer in some instances taught three generations of\r\nOjibway blood, and North and South, they were, in the course of their\r\nlabors, associated for a longer or shorter time, with more than eighty\r\ndifferent missionaries,--a noble band,--with few exceptions worthy the\r\nname they bore. Most of them have passed away, and their graves are\r\nscattered here and there from British America to Georgia.\r\n\r\nREV. WILLIAM T. BOUTWELL, who figures so prominently in the history of\r\nthe early missions in the St. Croix valley, was born in Hillsborough\r\ncounty, New Hampshire, Feb. 4, 1803. He was educated at Dartmouth and\r\nAndover colleges, and in 1831, the year of his graduation at Andover,\r\nhe came to the Northwest as a Presbyterian missionary. He spent one\r\nyear at Mackinaw, learning the Chippewa language, under the\r\ninstruction of Rev. W. M. Ferry, father of Senator Ferry, of Michigan.\r\n\r\nIn 1832 our government sent an embassy of thirty men, under the\r\ncontrol of the Indian agent at Ste. Marie, Henry R. Schoolcraft, to\r\ntranquilize the tribes and effect some advantageous treaties. The\r\nembassy was accompanied by an outfit of soldiers under the command of\r\nLieut. Allen, Dr. Houghton, physician, George Johnson, interpreter,\r\nand Mr. Boutwell. The embassy had a liberal outfit of provisions,\r\nequipages and trinkets for the Indians, and was conveyed in a large\r\nbateau of several tons capacity, and some birch canoes, the largest of\r\nwhich was thirty feet long, and capable of containing nine persons. On\r\narriving at Fond du Lac, the head of navigation on the St. Louis\r\nriver, Mr. Boutwell wrote as follows to the missionary board:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM T. BOUTWELL.]\r\n\r\n\"On arriving here I was not a little surprised to find four hundred\r\nsouls, half-breeds and white men. The scene at our landing was such as\r\nI never before witnessed, and enough to fill one, unaccustomed to the\r\nlike as myself, with wonder, if not with fear. The yelling of Indians,\r\nbarking of dogs, crying of children, running of the multitude,\r\ndischarge of musketry, and flourish of flags, was noise in the\r\nextreme. At ten o'clock I preached to about forty in English, the\r\nfirst sermon ever preached here, and at 4 P. M. I addressed, through\r\nMr. Johnson, more than twice that number of French, half-breeds and\r\nIndians; many of the latter of whom for the first time listened to the\r\nword of Life. All listened with attention and interest. My interpreter\r\nsat on my right, while a chief occupied a seat at my left. Around and\r\nbelow me, on the floor, sat his men, women and children, in a state of\r\nalmost entire nudity, many of whom had no more than a cloth about the\r\nloins, and a blanket, but some of the children not even a\r\nblanket,--all with their pipes and tobacco pouches, painted with all\r\nthe variety of figures that can be imagined.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Fond du Lac he proceeded with the expedition up the St. Louis\r\nriver, crossing the falls by a portage, and ascending to the point\r\nnearest Sandy lake, which was reached by a portage. The expedition\r\nproceeded up the Mississippi to Leech lake. Learning from the Indians\r\nat this point that Cass lake, the reputed source of the Mississippi,\r\nwas not the real source, the expedition proceeded, under the guidance\r\nof a chief and a number of his tribe, to ascend the river further.\r\nWhen they reached the lake, now known as Itasca, five of the party,\r\nLieut. Allen, Schoolcraft, Houghton, Johnson, and Boutwell, were sent\r\nin canoes with Indian guides to explore the shores of the lake. No\r\ninlet being found the party came to the conclusion that this was, as\r\nthe Indians claimed, the true source of the Mississippi river. Mr.\r\nSchoolcraft being satisfied as to the correctness of the observations,\r\nlanded his party on an island near the middle of the lake.\r\n\r\nHe was puzzled to know what name to give the lake, and asked Mr.\r\nBoutwell if he knew of any word that would express the term \"true head\r\nof the river.\" Mr. Boutwell said he could think of no single word that\r\nwould express it, but there were two Latin words that would answer the\r\npurpose, and those were _veritas_--true, and _caput_--head. Mr.\r\nSchoolcraft immediately wrote on a piece of paper the two words, and\r\nthen erasing the first syllable of the first word and the last\r\nsyllable of the latter, joined the remaining syllables. He then\r\nplanted the stars and stripes on a little eminence, and formally\r\nchristened the lake \"Itasca.\" They then proceeded to descend the\r\nMississippi. \"As we were passing through the outlet of the lake,\" said\r\nMr. Boutwell, \"I stopped my canoe on the shore and jumped across the\r\nMississippi. I considered that a great thing to relate in after\r\nyears.\"\r\n\r\nThe party with their own boats descended the Mississippi, distributing\r\ntobacco, medals and flags to Indians on their way.[E] \"When I see the\r\ngreat cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul now,\" said Mr. Boutwell, \"I\r\nhave to reflect that when we made our memorable trip down the river in\r\n1832 we stopped at St. Anthony falls, and I stood on the east bank and\r\nlooked across the river in profound admiration of the most beautiful\r\nlandscape I had ever seen, with only a few head of government cattle\r\nbelonging at Fort Snelling grazing upon it. The whole country on both\r\nsides of the river was as God had made it. When we passed the locality\r\nof St. Paul there was not even an Indian tepee to be seen.\"\r\n\r\nThe party halted at a Sioux Indian village at Kaposia, a few miles\r\nbelow St. Paul, and after a short consultation proceeded to the mouth\r\nof the St. Croix, and ascending the St. Croix to its source, made a\r\nportage of two miles to the source of the Burnt Wood river, which they\r\ndescended to Lake Superior, and thence returned to their starting\r\nplace. In the following year Mr. Boutwell established a mission at\r\nLeech lake. In giving an account of his reception by the Indians, he\r\nsays: \"When I arrived the men, with a few exceptions, were making\r\ntheir fall hunts, while their families remained at the lake and its\r\nvicinity to gather their corn and make rice. A few lodges were\r\nencamped quite near. These I began to visit, for the purpose of\r\nreading, singing, etc., in order to interest the children and awaken\r\nin them the desire for instruction. I told them about the children at\r\nMackinaw, the Sault, and at La Pointe, who could read, write and sing.\r\nTo this they would listen attentively, while the mother would often\r\nreply: 'My children are poor and ignorant.' To a person unaccustomed\r\nto Indian manners and Indian wildness it would have been amusing to\r\nhave seen the little ones, as I approached their lodge, running and\r\nscreaming, more terrified, if possible, than if they had met a bear\r\nrobbed of her whelps. It was not long, however, before most of them\r\novercame their fears; and in a few days my dwelling, a lodge which I\r\noccupied for three or four weeks, was frequented from morning till\r\nevening by an interesting group of boys, all desirous to learn to\r\nread, sing, etc. To have seen them hanging, some on one knee, others\r\non my shoulder, reading and singing, while others, whether from shame\r\nor fear I know not, who dared not venture within, were peeping in\r\nthrough the sides of the cottage, or lying flat upon the ground and\r\nlooking under the bottom, might have provoked a smile; especially to\r\nhave seen them as they caught a glance of my eye, springing upon their\r\nfeet and running like so many wild asses colts. The rain, cold and\r\nsnow were alike to them, in which they would come, day after day, many\r\nof them clad merely with a blanket and a narrow strip of cloth about\r\nthe loins. The men at length returned, and an opportunity was\r\npresented me for reading to them. The greater part listened\r\nattentively. Some would come back and ask me to read more. Others\r\nlaughed, and aimed to make sport of both me and my mission.\"\r\n\r\nHe continued to labor here until 1837, when the Indians becoming\r\ntroublesome, and having murdered Aitkin, an agent of the fur company,\r\nhe deemed it advisable to remove the mission to Pokegama lake. He\r\nlabored here faithfully, much respected by the Indians for his\r\nfirmness and christian devotion. In 1847 he removed to Stillwater and\r\nsettled on a farm near the city, where he is spending the remainder of\r\nhis days, cared for by his affectionate daughter Kate and her kind\r\nhusband, ----Jones. Though infirm in body on account of advanced age\r\nhis mind is clear and his memory retentive. He enjoys the respect\r\naccorded to venerable age, and that which pertains to an early and\r\nmiddle life spent in unusual toils and hardships in the noblest work\r\nintrusted to the hands of man.\r\n\r\nMRS. HESTER CROOKS BOUTWELL deserves honorable mention as the early\r\ncompanion of the devoted missionary. She was the daughter of Ramsey\r\nCrooks, of New York, an Indian trader. Her mother was a half-breed\r\nOjibway woman. Hester Crooks was born on Drummond island, Lake Huron,\r\nMay 30, 1817. Her father gave her a superior education at Mackinaw\r\nmission. She was a woman of tall and commanding figure, her black hair\r\nand eyes indicating her Indian origin. She was a fluent\r\nconversationalist, and careful and tidy in her personal appearance.\r\nShe died in Stillwater in 1853, leaving a family of seven children.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHENGWATANA.\r\n\r\nThis town derived its name from the Chippewa words, \"cheng-wa\" (pine)\r\nand \"tana\" (city), applied to an Indian village which from time\r\nimmemorial had been located near the mouth of Cross lake. This\r\nlocality had long been a rallying point for Indians and traders. When\r\nthe writer visited it, in 1846, it had the appearance of an ancient\r\nplace of resort. Half-breeds and whites with Indian wives settled\r\nhere, and in 1852 there were several log houses, and a hotel kept by\r\none Ebenezer Ayer. There was also a dam built for sluicing logs. Among\r\nthe early settlers were Duane Porter, George Goodwin, Herman Trott,\r\nJohn G. Randall, Emil, Gustave and Adolph Munch. Mr. Trott built a\r\nfine residence on the shore of Cross lake, afterward the home of S. A.\r\nHutchinson. The Munch brothers built a store and made other\r\nimprovements. John G. Randall, in 1856-7-8, manufactured lumber, ran\r\nit down the Kanabec and St. Croix rivers to Rush Seba, Sunrise and\r\nTaylor's Falls. In 1852, and soon after the building of the government\r\nroad to Superior City, a post office and a stage route from St. Paul\r\nto Superior City were established. The dam, to which reference has\r\nbeen made, was built in 1848, by Elam Greely. It is at the outlet of\r\nCross lake and has ten feet head. The flowage covers many thousands of\r\nacres. The ownership has changed several times. The tolls levied\r\namount to from ten to fifteen cents per thousand feet. The chartered\r\noperators control the flowage completely, opening and shutting gates\r\nat their pleasure. Many of the first settlers removed to other\r\nlocalities. Mr. Trott and the Munch brothers to St. Paul, J. G.\r\nRandall to Colorado, and Louis Ayd to Taylor's Falls.\r\n\r\nIn 1856 an effort was made to found a village on the site of the old\r\nIndian town of Chengwatana. Judd, Walker & Co. and Daniel A. Robertson\r\nsurveyed and platted the village of Alhambra, but the name was not\r\ngenerally accepted, and the old Indian name of Chengwatana superseded\r\nit. The town of Chengwatana was organized in 1874. The first\r\nsupervisors were Duane Porter, Resin Denman and Ferdinand Blank.\r\n\r\nLOUIS AYD was born in Germany in 1840; came to America in 1852 and\r\nsettled in Chengwatana. He served three and a half years as a soldier\r\nduring the Rebellion, and was seriously injured in the service. On his\r\nreturn he settled in Taylor's Falls. He is a well-to-do farmer and\r\ndealer in live stock for the meat market. He has been a member of the\r\nRoman Catholic church from childhood. He was married to Rosabella\r\nHoffman, of Hudson, Wisconsin, in 1871.\r\n\r\nDUANE PORTER, the son of a surgeon in the United States Army in the\r\nwar of 1812, was born in Washington county, New York, in 1825; came\r\nWest as far as Illinois in 1852, and to St. Croix Falls in 1844. He\r\nwas married in 1848 to Mary Lapraire, and in the same year located at\r\nChengwatama. His occupation is that of an explorer and lumberman. He\r\nhas ten children living.\r\n\r\nS. A. HUTCHINSON.--Mr. Hutchinson was a native of Maine, and while\r\nyet a youth came to the valley of the St. Croix, and located at\r\nChengwatana, where he married a Chippewa woman, and raised a family of\r\nhalf-breed children. \"Gus\" Hutchinson, as he was familiarly called,\r\nhad many noble traits of character and was very popular with his\r\nassociates. He had a well trained mind; was skilled as a lumberman and\r\nexplorer, and was of a genial disposition, honest in heart and true in\r\nhis friendships. He was elected sheriff of Pine county, and served\r\nfour years. On the night of Aug. 16, 1880, he was found in a sitting\r\nposture on his bed, lifeless, a rifle ball having pierced his heart.\r\nIt appeared, on investigation, that his oldest son wanted to marry an\r\nIndian girl, to which his father objected. On the night after the\r\nmurder the marriage took place in Indian style. Suspicion pointing\r\nstrongly toward mother and son, they were arrested, and an indictment\r\nfound by the grand jury against the son. He was tried and acquitted.\r\n\r\n\r\nHINCKLEY.\r\n\r\nThe township of Hinckley was organized in 1872. It includes a large\r\narea of land; heavily timbered with pine and hardwood. The soil is\r\nvaried, consisting of black and yellow sand loam with clay subsoil. It\r\nabounds in meadows, marshes, tamarack swamps, pine and hardwood\r\nridges, and is capable of cultivation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VILLAGE OF HINCKLEY\r\n\r\nLies midway between St. Paul and Duluth, on the St. Paul & Daluth\r\nrailroad. It was founded soon after the completion of the road. The\r\nManitoba railroad passes through the village, running from St. Cloud\r\nto Superior. It was incorporated in 1885. The following were the first\r\nofficers: President, James J. Brennan; recorder, S. W. Anderson;\r\ntrustees, James Morrison, Nels Parson, John Perry; treasurer, John\r\nBurke; justices of the peace, John Brennan, A. B. Clinch; constable,\r\nAndrew Stone. Prior to this incorporation, Hinckley had suffered\r\nconsiderably from the lawlessness of its occasional or transient\r\nresidents and visitors, and the large majority of the vote in favor of\r\nincorporation is justly considered as a triumph of law and order. The\r\nvillage has a saw mill doing a large business, a good depot, round\r\nhouse, four hotels, several stores, shops, and fine residences, a\r\ncommodious school house, and two churches--a Lutheran and Catholic.\r\nThe Minneapolis & Manitoba railroad connects here with the St. Paul &\r\nDuluth railroad, and is being extended to Superior.\r\n\r\nJAMES MORRISON was born on Cape Breton island in 1840. Mr. Morrison\r\nwas one of the first settlers of Hinckley, having come to the\r\nsettlement in 1869, in the employ of the St. Paul & Duluth railroad.\r\nHe has followed farming and hotel keeping. He is an active and\r\nindustrious man, the proprietor of a large hotel, and a member of the\r\nPresbyterian church.\r\n\r\n\r\nSANDSTONE VILLAGE\r\n\r\nIs located in the northwest quarter of section 15, township 42, range\r\n20. It contains about forty dwellings, three large boarding houses,\r\ntwo stores, one hotel and a stone saw mill with diamond-toothed saw,\r\nbuilt by Ring & Tobin, at a cost of $30,000. The stone quarries of the\r\nKettle River & Sandstone Company are located on sections 3, 10 and 15,\r\nin township 42, range 20, and extend two and three-quarters miles on\r\neach side of Kettle river. The first work in opening the quarries was\r\ndone Aug. 22, 1885. The village plat was surveyed in June, 1887, and a\r\npost office established there the February preceding, W. H. Grant,\r\nJr., being the first postmaster. The saw mill and the quarries give\r\nemployment to about four hundred men. Sandstone is located on the old\r\nsite of Fortuna. The Kettle River railroad was built to the quarries\r\nin 1886, from the St. Paul & Duluth railroad, a distance of five\r\nmiles. The Manitoba railroad, running to Superior, passes through the\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM H. GRANT, SR., one of the founders of Hinckley, and the\r\nproprietor and founder of the Sandstone enterprise, was born Dec. 23,\r\n1829, at Lyndborough, New Hampshire. He received his education at\r\nHancock Academy, New Hampshire, and Yates Academy, Orleans county, New\r\nYork. He studied law and was admitted to practice in 1854 at\r\nHillsborough, New Hampshire. He came to St. Paul in 1859, where he\r\nstill resides, his property interests at Sandstone being immediately\r\nunder the super vision of his son, W. H. Grant, Jr. He sold his\r\ninterest in May, 1888, for $100,000. He was married to Martha McKean\r\nin New Hampshire, January, 1855.\r\n\r\n\r\nKETTLE RIVER.\r\n\r\nThe town of Kettle River, including townships 43 and 44, lying on the\r\nwest line of the county, was organized in 1874. S. S. Griggs was\r\nchairman of the first board of supervisors. The town contains but one\r\nschool district. The first settler was S. S. Griggs, who, in company\r\nwith John S. Prince, of St. Paul, built a saw mill at the St. Paul &\r\nDuluth railroad crossing on Kettle river, in 1871-72. This was not a\r\nsuccessful venture. A post office was established at the mill, and S.\r\nS. Griggs was appointed postmaster. The Manitoba and St. Paul & Duluth\r\nrailroads pass through the town from south to north. The township now\r\nhas no settlement except about twenty-four families at the station and\r\nvillage. It is heavily timbered with pine and hardwood. There are\r\nmeadows, marshes and tamarack swamps, fine streams and beautiful\r\nlakes, and much excellent farming land besides. The Pine lakes in\r\ntownship 43, range 21, are beautiful sheets of water. There are no\r\ngood roads or public improvements.\r\n\r\nJOHN C. HANLEY was born in Covington, Kentucky, and was educated at\r\nOxford College, Ohio. He came to St. Paul in 1849, as a machinist and\r\nmillwright. He was married in 1853, at St. Anthony, to Sophia\r\nRamsdale. In 1862 he enlisted in Company M, Minnesota Mounted Cavalry,\r\na company recruited principally at Sunrise, Chisago county, by Capt.\r\nJames Starkey. He was commissioned second lieutenant and was with Gen.\r\nSibleys expedition against the Sioux. Subsequently he received a\r\ncaptain's commission, and recruited Company M, Second Minnesota\r\nCavalry, stationed on the frontier. He was mustered out in 1865. He\r\nresides at Kettle River.\r\n\r\n\r\nMISSION CREEK\r\n\r\nWas organized as a town in 1880. The first supervisors were M. Thomas,\r\nT. Johnson, Wm. McKean; Messrs. H. A. Taylor and Philip Riley & Co.,\r\nof St. Paul, were the first operators here. They built a saw mill with\r\na capacity of 3,000,000 feet per annum. This property has changed\r\nowners, and is now held by the John Martin Lumber Company, of St.\r\nPaul. It was burned down in 1885, but was immediately rebuilt.\r\n\r\n\r\nPINE CITY.\r\n\r\nThe town of Pine City was organized in 1874. The first supervisors\r\nwere Hiram Brackett, H. B. Hoffman and James Griffith. The village of\r\nPine City was platted in 1869. The original proprietors were James and\r\nStephen H. Petrie, Catherine Sloan and Luther Mendenhall. The survey\r\nwas made by B. W. Brunson. Wm. Branch acted as attorney and the\r\nacknowledgment was made by J. J. Egan, notary public, of St. Louis\r\ncounty. The village was organized in 1881, but the officers did not\r\nqualify until the following year.\r\n\r\nThe oldest settler was probably a Mr. Kirkland, of Quincy, Illinois,\r\nwho worked for some time on the banks of Cross lake, on the present\r\nsite of Pine City, hoping to be able to plant a colony there, but,\r\naccording to the testimony of Mrs. E. T. Ayer, the missionary became\r\ndisheartened by the Indian troubles, and left in 1841, abandoning his\r\nscheme. The completion of the railroad which crosses the Kanabec river\r\nat this point gave a great impetus to the prosperity of the village\r\nand neighborhood. It now contains a fine court house, built at a cost\r\nof $8,000, Roman Catholic, Presbyterian and Lutheran churches, good\r\nbuildings for graded and common schools, and three hotels. Pine City\r\nhas besides a pleasant park, the gift of Capt. Richard G. Robinson,\r\nwhich has been adorned and embellished and named after the donor,\r\n\"Robinson Park.\"\r\n\r\nRICHARD G. ROBINSON was born in Jackson county, Iowa, in 1829; he\r\nmoved thence with his parents to Illinois, and to St. Croix Falls in\r\n1848, where he followed lumbering, scaling, surveying and exploring.\r\nHe lived at St. Croix and Taylor's Falls until 1872, when he received\r\nthe appointment of land examiner for the Lake Superior & Mississippi\r\nRailroad Company. He was in the employ of the company twelve years,\r\nmaking his home at Pine City, where he still lives, engaged in\r\nlumbering and real estate. He was married to Catharine A. Fullenwider,\r\nof Iowa. Mrs. Robinson died at Pine City in 1885.\r\n\r\nHIRAM BRACKETT was born in 1817, in China, Maine, and came to Pine\r\nCity in 1868 from Aroostook county, Maine. He was among the first to\r\nmake improvements. He built a hotel and was the first postmaster in\r\nthe town. He died in 1883, leaving an estimable widow, three sons,\r\nJohn, Albert and Frank, and two daughters, Emily, married to Henry A.\r\nLinn, of Milwaukee, and Louise, married to Henry D. Crohurst, of Pine\r\nCity.\r\n\r\nRANDALL K. BURROWS, a native of Connecticut, came to Pine City in\r\n1869, and, with Adolph Munch, built a large stave mill on the shores\r\nof Cross lake. This proved an unfortunate investment, resulting in\r\nlitigation, during the progress of which the mill was destroyed by\r\nfire, in 1878. Mr. Burrows was an active, enthusiastic man, and worked\r\nhard for the interests of Pine City, filling many positions of trust.\r\nHe was elected to the state senate from the Twenty-eighth district, in\r\n1874. His seat was contested by John Hallburg, of Centre City. The\r\nSenate referred the question to the people, but in the election that\r\nfollowed (1875) he was defeated. In 1879 he removed to Dakota, where\r\nhe died three years later.\r\n\r\nJOHN S. FERSON came from Michigan to Pine City in 1869. During that\r\nand the succeeding year he was principal in building a first class\r\nsteam saw mill. It was located on a bay in the western part of the\r\ncity. This mill was burned in 1872, rebuilt and burned again. Mr.\r\nFerson has since removed to Dakota.\r\n\r\nSAMUEL MILLET settled in Pine City in 1869, and in 1870 erected the\r\nBay View House, on an elevated plateau commanding a fine view of Cross\r\nlake and Kanabec river. Mr. Millet died in 1879, leaving a widow, two\r\nsons and three daughters.\r\n\r\n\r\nROCK CREEK\r\n\r\nWas organized March, 1874. The first supervisors were Enoch Horton,\r\nFrank England, and S. M. Hewson. Obadiah Hewsom was town clerk. Enoch\r\nHorton and C. W. Gill were justices of the peace. Mr. Horton was the\r\nfirst settler, he having come to the county in 1872. The year\r\nfollowing he raised the first crop. Mr. Horton was from Colchester,\r\nNew York. He was born in 1811, and came to Minnesota in 1862. He was\r\nthe first postmaster at Rock Creek. Other settlers came in slowly.\r\nEdgerton, Gill & Co. built a saw mill in 1873, with a capacity of\r\n3,000,000 feet. This property has changed hands several times.\r\n\r\nCAPT. ENOCH HORTON commenced official life at the age of twenty-two\r\nyears, in New York, where he served twenty-eight years as justice of\r\nthe peace and county judge. He served during the Rebellion as captain\r\nof a company of sharpshooters.\r\n\r\n\r\nROYALTON\r\n\r\nWas organized in 1880. The first supervisors were Edward Peterson,\r\nAlexis Kain and Joseph Heiniger. It is a good farming township with\r\nmany good farms. The first settlement was made by Elam Greely, in\r\n1849, who made a farm and built a large barn, hauling the lumber from\r\nMarine Mills, a distance of seventy miles. The town was named in\r\nhonor of Royal C. Gray, who located on the Greely farm in 1854, in the\r\nnorthwest quarter of section 15, township 38, range 22, on the banks\r\nof the Kanabec river.\r\n\r\n\r\nWINDERMERE\r\n\r\nWas organized as a town Jan. 3, 1882. The first supervisors were\r\nAugust Schog, William Champlain and Frank Bloomquist.\r\n\r\nThe towns of Kettle River, Hinckley and Pine City were organized, and\r\nChengwatana reorganized by special act of the legislature in 1874, and\r\nat that time embraced all the territory in the county. Since 1874,\r\nMission Creek, Rock Creek and Royalton have been set off from Pine\r\nCity and Windermere from Kettle River.\r\n\r\nThe following villages were platted at the dates named: Neshodana, by\r\nClark, Cowell & Foster, in townships 41 and 42, ranges 15 and 16, in\r\n1856; Fortuna, by W. A. Porter, surveyor, at the crossing of Kettle\r\nriver and the military road, January, 1857; St. John's, by M. L.\r\nBenson, surveyor, in section 26, township 41, range 17, October, 1857;\r\nMidway, by Frank B. and Julia L. Lewis, proprietors, in the northwest\r\nquarter of section 34, township 40, range 21, September, 1855.\r\n\r\n\r\nA ROCK CREEK MURDER.\r\n\r\nA man passing under the name of Harris had been arrested for stealing\r\nhorses. George Hathaway started with the prisoner to Sunrise. Five\r\ndays afterward Hathaway's dead body was found, and the inquest decided\r\nthat he probably met his death by stabbing or shooting at the hands of\r\nhis prisoner, who made his escape, and was never again heard from.\r\nHathaway was a native of Passadumkeag, Maine.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BURNING OF A JAIL.\r\n\r\nMarch 22, 1884, a couple of young men, John Cope and William Leonard,\r\nwere arrested for drunkenness and disorderly conduct, and confined in\r\nthe Pine City jail, a wooden structure. About three o'clock the next\r\nmorning the jail was found to be on fire. All efforts to extinguish\r\nthe flames or rescue the unhappy prisoners were unavailing. The fire\r\noriginated from within, in all probability from the careless action of\r\nthe prisoners themselves in striking matches, either for the purpose\r\nof smoking or of exploring their cells.\r\n\r\n\r\nA DISFIGURED FAMILY.\r\n\r\nMr. Redman, the agent at the Kettle River railroad station, called my\r\nattention to the fact that old Batice is singularly disfigured. He was\r\nborn without thumbs or big toes. The fingers and remaining toes\r\nresemble birds' claws. Two of the fingers of each hand and two of the\r\ntoes on each foot are united to the tips but have distinct nails. Of\r\nhis four children three are disfigured like the father. His\r\ngrandchildren are many of them worse than himself, one having but one\r\nfinger.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIAN FAITH CURE.\r\n\r\nA woman at Pokegama was badly burned by the explosion of gunpowder\r\nwhile she was putting it in a flask. Her face became terribly swollen\r\nand black. The missionaries did what they could for her, but thought\r\nshe must die. After two days the Indian doctors held a medicine dance\r\nfor her benefit. After they had gone through with their magic arts the\r\nwoman arose, and, without any assistance, walked around distributing\r\npresents to the performers of the ceremony. It was truly wonderful.\r\nShe recovered rapidly.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIAN GRAVES.\r\n\r\nThe Chippewas bury their dead much as the whites do. The body is\r\ndeposited in a grave and covered with earth. A low wooden covering,\r\nsomewhat like the roof of a house, is reared above it, the gables\r\nresting on the ground. The roof is covered with white or bleached\r\nmuslin, and surmounted by a board cross. An aperture about six inches\r\nsquare is left in each end of the structure. The head of the grave is\r\ntoward the west, and here are deposited offerings of fruits and\r\ntrinkets of various kinds. We found at one grave a broken saucer, an\r\noyster can filled with blueberries, a large red apple, and a pair of\r\nold shoes. Friends of the deceased visit the graves for one or two\r\nyears, renewing their tributes of affection, and bringing offerings of\r\nfruit according to the season, and various foods, from acorns to dried\r\nvenison, but in time these visits are discontinued and the graves are\r\nneglected and forgotten.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTOICISM OF THE INDIAN.\r\n\r\nOn the banks of the Kettle river a five-year-old boy burned his hand\r\nbadly. The mother, after examining the wound, decided that it was\r\nincurable, ordered the boy to place his hand upon a block, and by a\r\nsingle blow from a common hatchet severed it from the wrist. The boy\r\nendured the suffering without flinching.\r\n\r\nOLD BATICE, _alias_ \"Kettle,\" lived on Kettle river in 1880. Counting\r\nby moons he claims to have lived there ninety-nine years. He is\r\ncertainly very old. He says that he has always been a friend to the\r\nwhites, and that in the Sioux outbreak of 1862 he counseled his people\r\nto remain quiet; that he was the enemy of the Sioux, three of whom he\r\nhad killed and scalped. To commemorate his warlike deeds in\r\nslaughtering his enemies, he wore three large eagle feathers in his\r\ngray hair. He claims to be half French.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN INDIAN DANCE.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1880, the Indians were practicing a new dance near the Kettle\r\nRiver railroad station, part of which it was my privilege to witness.\r\nThe dance house was a rudely constructed pole frame covered with birch\r\nbark, fastened down with willow twigs. About thirty dancers, male and\r\nfemale, and of all ages, were crowded in the dance house, sweating,\r\ngrunting, hopping and bounding at the tap of a deer skin drumhead, and\r\nthe \"chi-yi-chi-yi-chi-hoo\" of a quartette of boys and girls, squatted\r\nin a corner of the bark house. The din was incessant, the chant of the\r\nsingers, or howlers, monotonous and wearisome, yet the dancers stepped\r\nand bounded to their rude music as readily as do civilized dancers to\r\nthe more exquisite music of stringed instruments. This dance was the\r\nsame that so frightened the Burnett county people, and required at\r\nleast ten days for its complete performance. A few minutes'\r\nobservation amply satisfied us, and we gladly withdrew.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[E] Several years prior to this William Morrison had a trading station\r\nupon the shores of this lake, and is probably the first white man who\r\nvisited it, but it does not appear that he identified it as the source\r\nof the Mississippi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nKANABEC COUNTY.\r\n\r\n\r\nKanabec county, prior to 1849, was included in St. Croix county,\r\nWisconsin; thence until 1852 it was a part of Ramsey county,\r\nMinnesota; until 1854 a part of Chisago county; and thence until its\r\norganization in 1859, a part of Pine county. It was attached for\r\njudicial purposes at various times to Chisago, Isanti and Pine\r\ncounties. In 1882 it was organized for judicial purposes, Judge Crosby\r\nholding the first term of court at Brunswick. The second term was held\r\nat Mora in 1884, in the new court house.\r\n\r\nThe writer, when a member of the Minnesota senate in 1858, selected\r\nthe name and introduced the bill for the formation of the county. Its\r\nboundaries are Aitkin county on the north, Pine on the east, Isanti on\r\nthe south, and Mille Lacs on the west. It is well watered and drained\r\nby the Kanabec and its tributaries. This river is navigable to\r\nBrunswick, and one of its tributaries, Rice river, is navigable six\r\nmiles from its mouth to Rice lake. The soil is a rich, sandy loam,\r\ndeep, strong and productive. One-fifth of the entire surface was\r\noriginally covered with pines. About 25,000 acres are natural meadows,\r\nwhile much of the remainder is covered with hardwood, and a small\r\nportion is brush prairie, which can be easily rendered fit for\r\ncultivation. The best crops are wheat, oats and potatoes, but Indian\r\ncorn can be grown profitably as compared with other localities in\r\nMinnesota. Small fruits, wild and cultivated, grow luxuriantly.\r\nCranberries have been shipped in considerable quantities. Redtop,\r\nclover, and timothy grow rank, and are profitably cultivated. Upward\r\nof 5,000 tons of hay are cured annually. The lumbering interests are\r\nstill important, about 75,000,000 feet of logs being annually driven\r\nto the Stillwater boom. This county is spotted with lakes and abounds\r\nin streams capable of being utilized as water powers. Good building\r\ngranite is found on the Kanabec river above Mora, which will\r\neventually be quarried and exported.\r\n\r\nThe first permanent settlers were George L. Staples and James\r\nPennington, who came in 1855. They were followed by Stephen W. Tolman,\r\nAlvin De Wolf, John L. Spence and others. Gov. Sibley appointed the\r\nfollowing as the first board of officers, June 10, 1859: County\r\ncommissioners, Geo. L. Staples, chairman; Daniel Gordon, Benj. L.\r\nGifford; clerk and register of deeds, James C. Morrison; treasurer,\r\nAlvah Lougee; sheriff, Benj. L. Gifford. The first election was held\r\nin October, 1859. The following were elected county officers: County\r\ncommissioners, Geo. L. Staples, chairman; James Pennington, Geo.\r\nMorrison; auditor, Benj. Bill.\r\n\r\nIn the bill organizing the county, Brunswick was designated as the\r\ncounty seat, and so remained until 1882, when by popular vote Mora was\r\nselected. In 1883 the county built a court house at a cost of $5,000,\r\nand a jail costing $2,000. In 1874 the county built a bridge across\r\nthe Kanabec at Brunswick, the bridge and its approaches being 1,300\r\nfeet in length, at a cost of $5,000. In 1879 the county built a bridge\r\nacross the Kanabec at Grass Lake at a cost of $4,000. As this bridge\r\nobstructed navigation in 1884, the county, at a cost of $4,000,\r\nrebuilt it in such a way that steamers could pass underneath. In 1883\r\nanother bridge was built across the Kanabec in the town of Arthur at a\r\ncost of $4,000.\r\n\r\nThe first post office was established at Brunswick in 1859, Geo. L.\r\nStaples, postmaster. The first mail was from Anoka via Cambridge to\r\nBrunswick. In 1847 Rev. W. S. Boutwell preached the first sermon\r\nwithin the present limits of the county. The first deed recorded was a\r\nwarranty deed from Ralph Potter to John A. Snyder, both of Illinois,\r\nin June, 1857, conveying lands in sections 3 and 10, township 38,\r\nrange 25. The second deed recorded was from David Bagley to Hersey,\r\nHall, Whitney and Fenno, of Boston, and Isaac Staples of Stillwater,\r\nconveying the northeast quarter of section 1, township 38, range 24,\r\nand other lands.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTHUR.\r\n\r\nThe town of Arthur includes township 39, ranges 23, 24 and 25. It was\r\norganized in 1883. The first supervisors were: Ira A. Conger, Andrew\r\nE. Westling and Charles A. Staples; clerk, Stanton D. Seavey. The\r\nvillage of Mora was the first settlement. Anna C. Larson was the first\r\nchild born in the town. The first marriage was that of Frederick G.\r\nTurner and Edith Perkins. The first death was that of Henry Rust, in\r\n1847, killed by Indians. There is one house of worship, at what is\r\nknown as the Swedish mission.\r\n\r\n\r\nMORA,\r\n\r\nA village, platted in 1882, is located in section 11, township 39,\r\nrange 24, on the Hinckley branch of the Manitoba railroad. Myron R.\r\nKent, owner of the town plat, made the first improvements, building a\r\nhotel and post office, of which he became postmaster. Alvah J. Conger\r\nopened the first store in 1882. The village now contains a court\r\nhouse, school house, two hotels, five stores, three saloons, and many\r\nfine residences. Lake Mora, a lovely sheet of deep, blue water, about\r\none hundred and fifty acres in extent, is located within the village\r\nlimits. The village is beautifully situated on a plateau on the east\r\nside of Kanabec river.\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN L. DANFORTH lived in the county of Kanabec during the '70s.\r\nHis occupation was that of a farmer or lumberman. He died in\r\nStillwater in 1884.\r\n\r\nN. H. DANFORTH, brother of S. L., also settled here in the '70s, and\r\nstill resides here, an active business man.\r\n\r\nALVAH J. AND IRA CONGER are cousins. They came from Maine to Minnesota\r\nin 1850. Alvah J. kept the Tombler House in Wyoming. Subsequently he\r\nremoved to Cambridge, where he kept a hotel and store, and thence\r\nremoved to Pine City, where he kept a store until 1882, when he moved\r\nto Mora. He was married to Charlotte Pennington. They have no\r\nchildren. Ira Conger has been actively engaged in business at\r\nCambridge and other places, and moved to Mora in 1883, where he is\r\nproprietor of a hotel and store. His oldest son, John, has charge of\r\nhis business interests.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRONSON.\r\n\r\nThis village is yet unplatted. It is located in section 21, range 24,\r\non the line of the Manitoba railroad. A post office was established\r\nhere in 1884, of which Frank P. Burleigh is postmaster. Adjoining and\r\nincluding this village is the large farm of Isaac Staples, including\r\n2,000 acres, of which six hundred and fifty acres are under\r\ncultivation. The improvements on the farm are two large barns, one\r\nstore, one blacksmith shop, one wood working shop, and commodious\r\ndwellings for employes. This farm is headquarters for the lumbering\r\ninterests of Mr. Staples in Kanabec county.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRUNSWICK\r\n\r\nIncludes township 38, ranges 24 and 25. The town was organized in\r\n1883. The first supervisors were Eric Hokansen, John Rines and Haquin\r\nEkman. The first school was taught by Charlotte Pennington, in 1856.\r\nThe first death was that of ---- Cowan, killed accidentally, in 1857.\r\nThere are two church organizations, Swedish Baptist and Swedish\r\nLutheran. Stephen E. Tallman built a saw mill in 1870, and a flour\r\nmill in 1879. The village of Brunswick is located in the southwest\r\nquarter of section 1, township 38; range 24. It was platted in 1856,\r\nby Isaac and George Staples. It was originally designated as the\r\ncounty seat.\r\n\r\n\r\nGROUND HOUSE CITY\r\n\r\nWas platted by Isaac Staples for Hersey, Staples & Co., Jan 17, 1857,\r\nin section 7, township 38, range 24.\r\n\r\nJAMES PENNINGTON was born in Queensborough, New Brunswick, in 1799. He\r\nlived in Houlton, Maine, fifteen years, and came to Kanabec county in\r\n1854 with his family, who were the first permanent settlers in the\r\ncounty. Mr. Pennington farmed and lumbered. He died in December, 1887.\r\nMrs. Pennington died in 1878. Six sons and three daughters are living.\r\nThe sons are residents of Minnesota. The daughters are married as\r\nfollows: Elisabeth to ---- Grant, of Detroit, Minnesota; Charlotte to\r\nA. J. Conger, of Mora, Minnesota; Augusta to B. C. Newport, of\r\nPipestone, Minnesota.\r\n\r\nGEORGE L. STAPLES settled in section 1, township 38, range 24, in\r\n1855. He lived there eight years and filled various responsible\r\noffices. He was an upright, conscientious man, much respected by all\r\nwho knew him. In 1863 he removed to Monticello, Minnesota, and died in\r\n1877, leaving a widow, five sons and a daughter. Mr. Staples raised\r\nthe first crop in the county, opened the first store, and gave the\r\nname of Brunswick to the town. Isaac Edwin Staples, son of George, was\r\nthe first white child born in the county. He was clerk of court in\r\nMorrison county in 1887.\r\n\r\nDANIEL GORDON was born in Readfield, Maine, in 1809. In 1856 he\r\nsettled in the southeast quarter of section 1, township 38, range 24.\r\nHe was married to widow Tallman in Brunswick. This was the first\r\nmarriage in the town. Mrs. Gordon died in June, 1885.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRASS LAKE\r\n\r\nIncludes township 38, range 23. It was organized in 1883. It is\r\nthickly settled, mostly by Swedes. They have good farms, roads and\r\nschools. The first settler was Solomon Anderson; the second, Benjamin\r\nNorton; both were farmers. There are in this town three houses of\r\nworship, two belonging to the Swedish mission, and one to the\r\nBaptists. There are five school houses.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the county, consisting mostly of pine lands, and\r\nincluding nine townships, is without organization or township\r\ngovernment. It is divided into three assessment districts over which\r\nthe county exercises jurisdiction, making levies and collecting taxes.\r\n\r\n\r\nISANTI COUNTY.\r\n\r\nIsanti county lies directly west of Chisago and south of Kanabec. It\r\nis bounded on the west and south by Sherburne, Mille Lacs and Anoka\r\ncounties, and contains about fourteen towns. The soil is well adapted\r\nfor agriculture. The county has no large lakes, but is well watered by\r\ntributaries of Rum and Sunrise rivers. It is well timbered in the\r\nnorth with sugar maple. The settlers are chiefly Scandinavians, who,\r\nby their industry, have made the plains and oak ridges to blossom with\r\nclover and the cereals. The county was organized Feb. 13, 1857. It\r\ntook its name from a tribe of Indians who some time ago occupied the\r\ncountry about Mille Lacs. The first board of county commissioners\r\nconsisted of Oscar Smith, Hugh Wylie and Elbridge G. Clough. The first\r\ncounty officers were: William Tubbs, auditor; F. H. Moon, treasurer;\r\nG. G. Griswold, register of deeds; Stephen Hewson, judge of probate;\r\nH. M. Davis, clerk; George L. Henderson, sheriff. The first court was\r\nheld by Judge C. E. Vanderburgh in October, 1871. Prior to this time\r\nIsanti had been attached to Auoka county for judicial purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE,\r\n\r\nThe county seat of Isanti, was incorporated as a village in 1876. It\r\nis pleasantly located on the west side of Rum river. It has one\r\nflouring mill, a newspaper office, and several stores, shops,\r\ndwellings and churches. The county buildings are neat and convenient.\r\nThe new court house cost $7,000. It is worthy of mention that B. A.\r\nLatta, as county treasurer, paid the first money into the hands of the\r\nstate treasurer for war purposes. The first postmasters in the county\r\nwere Van Vliet Ainsley, of Spencer Brook, and G. G. Griswold, in 1858.\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTH BRANCH TOWN\r\n\r\nLies on the headwaters of the Sunrise river. It was settled, as early\r\nas 1855, by John P. Owens, W. A. Hobbs, B. T. Huntley, and John\r\nSchinler. It was organized as a town in 1858, John P. Owens being\r\nchairman of the first board of supervisors. John Schinler raised the\r\nfirst crop, in 1857. Schools were established in 1860.\r\n\r\n\r\nOXFORD.\r\n\r\nRensselaer Grant, M. Hurley and Stephen Hewson settled within the\r\npresent limits of this town in 1855. At that time the town was not\r\norganized. In 1865 it was included within the limits of North Branch,\r\nbut in 1878 the town of Oxford was set off as now defined. The first\r\nsupervisors were John Bachelor, P. Lillygrin and P. Berg. Stephen\r\nHewson was town clerk, and has retained the office ever since. A post\r\noffice was established in 1863. Stephen Hewson was postmaster, and has\r\nheld the office continuously ever since. The town is well settled by\r\nfarmers. In 1870 a cyclone passed through the town, destroying\r\neverything in its track, which was about twenty rods wide. Not a\r\nbuilding was left on the homestead of Mr. Hewson. His fine large barn\r\nwas torn to pieces and the fragments scattered for the distance of a\r\nmile.\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN HEWSON is a native of England, which he left in 1844. He\r\nresided in Canada a few years, then came to Chicago, and later to\r\nMinnesota. He was for awhile a partner in the publishing firm of E. S.\r\nGoodrich & Co., then proprietors of the St. Paul _Pioneer_. He made\r\nhis present home in Oxford in 1855, and has since that time been\r\nintimately identified with its history and that of the county of\r\nIsanti. He was a representative from the Fourth district in the\r\nlegislature of 1865. He has filled the offices of county auditor,\r\ncounty commissioner and judge of probate court. As an ordained\r\nminister of the Methodist church he takes an active interest in\r\nreligious matters, serving as superintendent of the Sunday-school, and\r\noccasionally filling the pulpit. Five of his daughters are school\r\nteachers, one of whom, Mary, in 1870, taught the first school in\r\nOxford. He remains hale and hearty in his seventy-seventh year.\r\n\r\nGEORGE W. NESBIT was born in 1828, in Delaware county, New York. He\r\nreceived an academic education. He came in 1856 to St. Francis, Anoka\r\ncounty, Minnesota, and in 1863 to Isanti county. He has been engaged\r\nin farming and selling goods, and is an energetic, busy man. He made\r\nthe first pre-emption timber claim on the Mille Lacs reservation,\r\nwhich was rejected. Mr. Nesbit was married in New York and has a\r\nfamily of six children.\r\n\r\nRENSSELAER GRANT was born in New York in 1816. His father was a native\r\nof Scotland but emigrated to the United States and took part in the\r\nwar of 1812. Mr. Grant was married in Saratoga county, New York, in\r\n1837, to Libiah Mitchell. The Grants moved to Illinois in 1850, and to\r\nIsanti county in 1856. Mr. and Mrs. Grant died at North Branch, in\r\n1886, leaving, three married sons, two living in Isanti county, and\r\none at Rush City, and three daughters, the eldest married to J. W.\r\nDelamater, the second to W. H. Hobbs, the third living in St. Paul.\r\n\r\n\r\nMILLE LACS COUNTY.\r\n\r\nThis county is bounded on the north by Mille Lacs lake and Aitkin\r\ncounty, on the east by Isanti, Kanabec and Aitkin, on the south by\r\nSherburne and on the west by Morrison and Benton counties, and\r\nincludes about 17 townships extending from south to north a distance\r\nof 48 miles, and having a breadth of 12 miles, excepting the two upper\r\nseries of towns, which have a width of 18 miles. It is, excepting two\r\nagricultural towns in the south, heavily timbered, chiefly with pine.\r\nIt is well watered by Rum river and its tributaries, and by the body\r\nof water known as Mille Lacs, a large picturesque lake, which covers\r\nover one hundred and five sections of Aitkin, Crow Wing and Mille Lacs\r\ncounties. The tributaries of the St. Croix also drain the\r\nnortheastern part of the county. The southern townships consist of\r\nprairies and oak openings, the northern and central parts being\r\ncovered with hardwood and pine. Immense quantities have been already\r\nmarketed. The hardwood ridges and flats offer good farming lands, and\r\nthe wild meadows, scattered over the county, excellent hay and\r\npasturage.\r\n\r\nMille Lacs lake, the largest inland lake in Minnesota, is a beautiful\r\nand picturesque sheet of water, with receding wooded shores, with but\r\nlittle low land adjoining. The waters are deep and clear and\r\nabundantly supplied with fish. This lake, when reached by railways,\r\nwill be one of the most pleasant summer resorts in the Northwest. It\r\nalready attracts the attention of the tourist. A steamer built in 1885\r\nfloats upon its waters. The lake is about eighteen miles long by from\r\ntwelve to fifteen wide, and covers about six townships. Three small\r\nislands gem its surface, one of which, from its columnar appearance,\r\nseems to be of volcanic or igneous formation.\r\n\r\nThe Mille Lacs reservation covers about four fractional towns,\r\nbordering the southern shore of the lake. Since the treaty these lands\r\nhave been covered by pre-emptions, soldiers' warrants and half-breed\r\nscrip, but are held by a doubtful tenure owing to the uncertain and\r\nvarious rulings of the land department. Under the provisions of the\r\ntreaty, the Indians, a band of Chippewas, were allowed to retain\r\npossession until ordered to remove. In anticipation of this order\r\nsettlements have been made at various periods, and patents have been\r\nissued to the pre emptors in a few cases, but in many cases refused.\r\nHalf-breed scrip has been laid upon thousands of acres under one\r\nadministration at Washington, the permission to be countermanded by\r\nanother. Meanwhile the Indians, not having received the order for\r\nremoval, claim to be the owners of the land, and with some show of\r\njustice. In 1882 the Manitoba Railroad Company built a road through\r\nthe county from east to west, through township 40, ranges 26 and 27.\r\n\r\nIn the early divisions of Minnesota into counties, the territory of\r\nMille Lacs was included in Ramsey and Benton counties. Prior to its\r\npresent organization, a county called Monroe, covering the territory\r\nof Mille Lacs, was established but never organized. By legislative\r\nenactment in 1857 Mille Lacs county was established and organized by\r\nthe people in 1860, the counties of which its territory was originally\r\na part concurring, and Princeton was made the county seat. In 1859\r\nthere had been effected the organization of one town in the county,\r\nknown as Princeton. This has since been subdivided into Princeton\r\nGreenbush, and Milo. The officers of the town organization in 1859\r\nwere: Supervisors, C. W. Houston, Charles Pratt, Joseph L. Cater. The\r\nfirst county election, held April, 1860, resulted in the election of\r\nthe following officers: County commissioners, Joseph L. Cater,\r\nchairman; Samuel Orton, C. S. Moses; auditor and register of deeds, W.\r\nW. Payne; clerk of court, S. M. Byers; treasurer, E. J. Whitney;\r\nsheriff, Wm. McCauley; probate judge, Samuel Ross. The first term of\r\ncourt was held June 3, 1861, E. C. Vanderburgh, presiding judge. The\r\nfirst recorded deed was from E. J. Whitney to Isaac Staples, and bears\r\ndate Aug. 4, 1854.\r\n\r\n\r\nMILACCA\r\n\r\nHas a pleasant site on the Manitoba railroad, on the banks of Rum\r\nriver at the crossing of the Manitoba & Superior and the junction of\r\nthe Elk River & Princeton railroad. The Manitoba Company have a good\r\nsaw mill here, with a capacity of 125,000 feet per day, built at a\r\ncost of $50,000. A planing mill is attached. There is a good three\r\nstory hotel, well kept, here.\r\n\r\nThe village was surveyed and platted March 24, 1886; Chas. Keith,\r\nsurveyor; James J. Hill, president of the Mille Lacs Lumber Company,\r\nproprietor. It is located in the town of Greenbush.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRIDGMAN VILLAGE,\r\n\r\nLocated in the town of Milo, has a steam saw mill, spoke and hub\r\nfactory, around which are several residences.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINCETON.\r\n\r\nThe village of Princeton is located at the junction of the two\r\nbranches of the Rum river, on a beautiful prairie, surrounded by rich\r\nprairie and timber lands. The first log house was built in 1849, and\r\nkept as a stopping place by a mulatto known as \"Banjo Bill.\" This\r\nhouse is still standing. The first permanent settlers were A. B.\r\nDamon, O. E. Garrison, C. H. Chadbourne, Edwin Allen, John W. Allen,\r\nChas. Whitcomb, Joseph L. Cater, W. F. Dunham, and Samuel Ross. They\r\nwere also the first settlers in the county, and came in 1853-7. In\r\n1855 Messrs. Damon and Allen farmed on the present site of the\r\nvillage. The village was surveyed and platted Feb. 11, 1859, by S.\r\nRoss & Co. S. Ross also built a hotel where the North Star Hotel now\r\nstands. This year the first frame building was erected and used as a\r\nstore. W. F. Dunham built a steam saw mill. The first school house was\r\nbuilt, although school organization was not effected until 1858. James\r\nM. Dayton taught the first school. A post office was established with\r\nO. E. Garrison as postmaster. Samuel Ross brought the mail once a week\r\nfrom Anoka. A Congregational church was established, of which Rev.\r\nRoyal Twichell was chosen as pastor. The Methodists organized a\r\nsociety the following year.\r\n\r\nThe village was incorporated March 13, 1877, by legislative enactment.\r\nThe commissioners appointed under the organic act were E. C. Giles, H.\r\nB. Cowles, C. H. Rines, B. F. Whiting, and Charles Keith. At the\r\nelection ordered by them the following officers were chosen:\r\nPresident, C. H. Rines; trustees. F. M. Campbell, Isaiah S. Mudgett,\r\nThomas F. Caly; recorder, Silas L. Staples; treasurer, D. H. Murray;\r\njustices of the peace, Scott M. Justice, Charles Keith. The Princeton\r\n_Appeal_ was established by Rev. John Quigley in 1873, but\r\ndiscontinued in 1875. In December, 1876, Robert C. Dunn started the\r\nPrinceton _Union_, which he still publishes.\r\n\r\nThe Manitoba branch railroad from Elk River to Milacca village passes\r\nthrough Princeton. The first train arrived Nov. 30, 1880. The county\r\ncontributed $47,000 in bonds at five per cent interest for twenty\r\nyears, to aid in building the road. The St. Paul, Mille Lacs,\r\nBrainerd, Leech Lake & Crookston railroad will, when completed, pass\r\nthrough Princeton. An excellent school building was erected in 1885,\r\nat a cost of about $7,000. Guy Ewing is principal of the school, which\r\nis graded. The Grand Army of the Republic have a post here known as\r\nthe Wallace Rines post. The Masons have an organization, with a\r\nsplendid hall. A three story hotel, built by Samuel Ross, is kept by\r\nhis only daughter, Mrs. Barker. A two story brick hotel, the\r\nCommercial House, Henry Newbert, proprietor, a handsome structure, was\r\nbuilt in 1887. The Mille Lacs County Bank, located here, has a paid up\r\ncapital of $20,000. Charles Erickson is president; L. P. Hyberg, vice\r\npresident; Frank Hewse, clerk. Princeton has one steam saw mill, two\r\nflouring mills, one feed mill, two elevators with a capacity of 60,000\r\nbushels, and one brewery. A court house and jail are in process of\r\nerection at an estimated cost of $10,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIOGRAPHICAL.\r\n\r\nSAMUEL ROSS was born Aug. 22, 1812. He attended Western Reserve\r\nCollege, but through ill health did not graduate. He came to Iowa in\r\n1839, where he was married to Mary Vaughn in 1841. He came to\r\nPrinceton in 1855, where he took an active part in building up the\r\ntown and county, filled many prominent and responsible positions in\r\nthe village and county, and served as representative of the first\r\nstate legislature. Mrs. Ross died in 1851; Mr. Ross died in 1881,\r\nleaving an only daughter, Olive R., widow of A. P. Barker, who was a\r\nprominent lawyer of Princeton. Mrs. Barker was elected superintendent\r\nof schools in 1880, to which position she has been re-elected and is\r\nat present filling the office efficiently. She was the first female\r\nsuperintendent elected in Minnesota.\r\n\r\nJOSEPH L. CATER was born in Strafford county, New Hampshire, in 1828.\r\nHe came to Princeton in 1855 and engaged in farming. His name appears\r\nin all the original organizations of town and county. M. V. B. Cater\r\nand sons have also been active and prominent citizens of Princeton. M.\r\nV. B. Cater died some years since.\r\n\r\nEDWIN ALLEN, originally from Welton, Maine, came to Princeton in 1855\r\nand engaged in farming.\r\n\r\nJOHN H. ALLEN came from Maine to Princeton in 1854, engaged in farming\r\nand became prominent as a public spirited citizen. He held various\r\npositions of trust in the county and was appointed receiver of the\r\nland office at Fergus Falls by President Hayes, and resides there.\r\n\r\nA. B. DAMON came from Maine to Princeton in 1853 and made the first\r\nclaim on the town site.\r\n\r\nC. H. CHADBOURNE was born at Lexington, Massachusetts. At the age of\r\nsixteen he embarked in a seafaring life in which he continued nine\r\nyears. Mr. Chadbourne, wishing to abandon his seafaring ways, and to\r\nput himself beyond danger of resuming them, came to the centre of the\r\ncontinent and located on a farm near Princeton in 1856. He has since\r\nfollowed farming continuously. His farm consists of 900 acres under\r\ncultivation, 500 of which is devoted to tame grass and pasturage, on\r\nwhich he feeds 150 head of blooded stock. He has a large dairy which\r\nnets him $1,200 annually. He was a member of the state legislatures of\r\n1874-5 and was seven years county commissioner of Sherburne county.\r\nMr. Chadbourne was married in 1852 to Deborah Crowell. They have three\r\nsons and two daughters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nCHISAGO COUNTY.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATION--SURFACE--SCENERY.\r\n\r\nChisago county, located on the west bank of the St. Croix river,\r\nbetween the counties of Pine on the north and Washington on the south,\r\nthe St. Croix river on the east and the counties of Isanti and Anoka\r\non the west, presents an agreeable variety of surface, upland and\r\ngenerally undulating, covered with hard and soft wood timber, well\r\nwatered by lakes and streams. Its principal streams are the St. Croix\r\nand its tributaries, Rush and Sunrise rivers and Goose creek, and its\r\nprincipal lakes are Chisago, Sunrise, Green, Rush, and Goose lakes.\r\nIts lake scenery is unsurpassed in beauty. The county takes the name\r\nof its largest and most beautiful lake. In its original, or rather\r\naboriginal, form it was Ki-chi-sago, from two Chippewa words meaning\r\n\"kichi,\" large, and \"saga,\" fair or lovely. For euphonic\r\nconsiderations the first syllable was dropped.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHISAGO LAKE.\r\n\r\nThis lake is conspicuous for its size, the clearness of its waters,\r\nits winding shore and islands, its bays, peninsulas, capes, and\r\npromontories. It has fully fifty miles of meandering shore line. Its\r\nshores and islands are well timbered with maple and other hard woods.\r\nIt has no waste swamps, or marsh borders. When the writer first came\r\nto Taylor's Falls, this beautiful lake was unknown to fame. No one had\r\nseen it or could point out its location. Indians brought fish and\r\nmaple sugar from a lake which they called Ki-chi-sago Sagi-a-gan, or\r\n\"large and lovely lake.\" This lake, they said, abounded with \"kego,\"\r\nfish.\r\n\r\nIn 1851 the writer, with Bart Emery, made a visit to this beautiful\r\nsheet of water. We found it what its Indian name imports, \"fair and\r\nlovely water.\" The government had, the year before, completed a survey\r\nof the lake, and it was high time that it should be given a name by\r\nwhich it should be designated on the map and recognized by civilized\r\nvisitors. What name more beautiful and appropriate than that which the\r\nIndians had already given it. That name we at once recognized and used\r\nall our influence to perpetuate under somewhat adverse influences; for\r\nSwedish emigrants having settled in its neighborhood, a strong effort\r\nwas made to christen it \"Swede Lake,\" but the lake is to-day known as\r\nChisago, and Chisago it is likely to remain. We believe in the policy\r\nof retaining the old Indian names whenever possible. As a rule they\r\nare far more musical and appropriate than any we can apply. The\r\nIndians have left us their lands, their lakes, their streams; let us\r\naccept with them the names by which they were known. Some have been\r\ntranslated into English and appear on the maps as Goose, Elk, Beaver\r\nand Snake. By all means let us retranslate them in memory of the race\r\nthat once owned them.\r\n\r\n\r\nDALLES OF ST. CROIX.\r\n\r\nChisago county shares with Polk county in the ownership of the wildest\r\nand most peculiar scenery in the valley of the St. Croix. At Taylor's\r\nFalls, the head of navigation, the river flows between ledges of trap\r\nrock, varying in height from fifty to two hundred and fifty feet, for\r\nthe most part perpendicular, but wildly irregular, as is common in\r\ntrap rock formations. These ledges are crowned with pine trees and a\r\ndense undergrowth of bushes and vines. The prevailing color of the\r\nrock is a cold or bluish gray, but broken occasionally by brilliant\r\npatches of coloring, red, yellow or green, as they may be stained by\r\noxides of the metals, or covered with lichens and mosses. This\r\nformation is known as \"The Dalles,\" sometimes improperly styled\r\n\"Dells.\" The rocks composing it are porphyritic trap, an igneous rock\r\nforced upward from the interior of the earth through crevices in the\r\ncrust while still in a liquid state and then solidifying in masses,\r\nsometimes prismatic but oftener in irregular polygons, and broken by\r\nparallel lines of cleavage. Some geological experts claim that these\r\nrocks are \"in place\" as forming a part of the original crust of the\r\nearth, but the balance of evidence seems to be in favor of their\r\nhaving been erupted at a comparatively modern period. This is\r\nevidenced by the presence of water-worn boulders and pebbles, imbedded\r\nin the trap, somewhat like plums in a pudding, while it was yet\r\nplastic; and now forming a species of conglomerate as hard and compact\r\nas the trap itself. These rocks are supposed to be rich in copper and\r\nsilver, and miners have spent much time in prospecting for these\r\nmetals.\r\n\r\nWhatever the origin of the rocks, it is conceded that they were once\r\nplastic, at which time this region could not have been a safe or\r\npleasant dwelling place for such beings as now inhabit the world. The\r\ntheory of a comparatively recent eruption of these rocks is not a\r\npleasant one, for the suggestion forces itself upon the mind that that\r\nwhich has been, at least in recent times, may occur again. The\r\noccasional recurrence of earthquakes on our western coast, and the\r\nrecent severe disturbances in South Carolina and Georgia, raise the\r\nquery whether this region may not again be visited with an outburst\r\nand overflow of trap, terrible and destructive as the first. The\r\nfoundations, however, seem firm enough to last forever. The rocks are\r\nof unusual hardness, and the crust of the earth is probably as solid\r\nand thick here as elsewhere. The Dalles proper are about one mile in\r\nlength. The river, in its passage through them, varies in width from\r\none hundred and fifty to three hundred feet. It was formerly reported\r\nunfathomable, but in recent years, owing to a filling up process\r\ncaused by the debris of the log drivers, it is found to be not more\r\nthan a hundred feet in its deepest place. The river makes an abrupt\r\nbend about a bold promontory of trap known as Angle or Elbow Rock. To\r\nthe first voyageurs this seemed to be the end of the river, and gave\r\nrise to the story that at this point the river burst out of the rocks.\r\nMuch of the frontage of the rocks upon the river is smooth and\r\nperpendicular, and stained with oxides of iron and copper. In places\r\nit is broken. The upper rocks are disintegrated by the action of rain\r\nand frost, and, where far enough from the river, have fallen so as to\r\nform a talus or slope of angular fragments to the water's edge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DEVIL'S CHAIR.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEVIL'S CHAIR.\r\n\r\nThere are some instances in which, by the breaking away and falling of\r\nsmaller rocks, larger rocks have been left standing in the form of\r\ncolumns. Most notable of these are the \"Devil's Pulpit,\" and the\r\n\"Devil's Chair.\" The former, owing to surrounding shrubbery, is not\r\neasily seen. The latter is a conspicuous object on the western shore\r\nof the river a few rods below the lower landing. It stands on the\r\nslope formed by the debris of a precipice that rises here about 120\r\nfeet above the river. Its base is about 40 feet above low water mark;\r\nthe column itself reaches 45 feet higher. It is composed of many\r\nangular pieces of trap, the upper portion bearing a rude resemblance\r\nto a chair. It is considered quite a feat to climb to the summit. The\r\nface of the rocks is disfigured by the names of ambitious and\r\nundeserving persons. The nuisance of names and advertisements painted\r\nupon the most prominent rocks in the Dalles is one that every lover of\r\nNature will wish to have abated. To spend an hour climbing amongst\r\nthese precipices to find in some conspicuous place the advertisement\r\nof a quack medicine, illustrates the adage: \"There is but one step\r\nfrom the sublime to the ridiculous.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WELLS.\r\n\r\nA more remarkable curiosity may be found on that bench or middle\r\nplateau of the Dalles, lying between the upper and the lower Taylor's\r\nFalls landings, in what has been not inaptly styled \"The Wells.\" These\r\nare openings, or pits, not much unlike wells, in places where the trap\r\nis not more than 50 feet above water level, varying in width from a\r\nfew inches to 30 or 40 feet, the deepest being from 20 to 25 feet.\r\nThese seem to have been formed by the action of water upon pebbles or\r\nboulders, much as \"pot holes\" are now being formed in the rocky\r\nbottoms of running streams. The water falls upon the pebbles or\r\nboulders in such a way as to cause them to revolve and act as a drill,\r\nboring holes in the rock proportioned to the force of the agencies\r\nemployed. Some of these boulders and pebbles, worn to a spherical\r\nshape, were originally found at the bottoms of these wells, but have\r\nbeen mostly carried away by the curious. Some of the wells are cut\r\nthrough solid pieces of trap. The walls of others are seamed and\r\njointed; in some cases fragments have fallen out, and in others the\r\nentire side of the wells has been violently disrupted and partly\r\nfilled with debris. The extreme hardness of the trap rock militates\r\nsomewhat against the theory of formation above given. It is, however,\r\nnot improbable that this hardness was acquired after long exposure to\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\n\r\nSETTLEMENT AND ORGANIZATION.\r\n\r\nIn the history of St. Croix Falls mention has been made of some of the\r\npioneers of Chisago county. St. Croix Falls and Taylor's Falls, the\r\npioneer settlement of Chisago county, though a river divides them\r\nwhich is also the boundary line of two states, have much that is\r\ncommon in their early history. The inhabitants were always greatly\r\ninterested in what was going on over the river. We may add, that\r\nalthough they now stand in the attitude of rival cities, their\r\ninterests are still identical, and we believe that, but for the unwise\r\npolicy of making St. Croix river a state line, they might be to-day\r\nunder one city government, and as compact and harmonious as though no\r\nSt. Croix river rolled between them. The river is their joint\r\nproperty; both have the same heritage of trap rocks and pines, the\r\nsame milling privileges, the same lumbering interests, and, it must be\r\nconfessed, they remain up to the present time about equally mated. J.\r\nR. Brown was unquestionably the pioneer of the settlement. Frank\r\nSteele says he found J. R. Brown trading, in 1837, on the spot now the\r\nsite of Taylor's Falls.\r\n\r\nHe was not, however, the first white man upon the soil. There is some\r\ndocumentary evidence of the establishment by the French of a fort\r\nforty leagues up the St. Croix some time between the years 1700 and\r\n1703. This fort was in all probability erected on the plateau below\r\nthe Dalles, the distance given, forty leagues, being exaggerated after\r\nthe fashion of the early voyageurs. It was called Fort St. Croix.\r\nThere was also a prehistoric settlement, the ruins of which the writer\r\nnoted as early as 1851, on the school land addition to Taylor's Falls.\r\nThese were the foundations of nine houses, plainly visible. Over some\r\nof them trees two feet in diameter were growing. The rock foundations\r\nranged in size from twenty to thirty feet, with the hearth containing\r\nashes underlying the debris of ages, on smooth hearthstones showing\r\nyears of service, being apparently a century old. These were the\r\nhomes, undoubtedly, of a civilized people, and we may claim for\r\nTaylor's Falls, Chisago county, one of the first improvements made by\r\nwhites in the limits of Minnesota.\r\n\r\nDuring the last half of the last century a prominent trading post was\r\nestablished and maintained for many years on the St. Croix river,\r\nwhich was founded by Pierre Grinow, and during the close of the last\r\ncentury it was in the charge of one James Perlier, who afterward\r\nbecame one of the most useful citizens of Green Bay, Wisconsin.\r\nLawrence Barth was also here in 1793. The evidence of the existence of\r\nthis trading post rests upon traditions and the ruins referred to.\r\nRecurring to the pioneer Brown, the most irrepressible of all the\r\nadvance guard of civilization, we find him only a transient\r\ninhabitant. He stayed long enough to cut 200,000 feet of pine logs\r\nfrom the present site of Taylor's Falls, when the neighborhood lost\r\nits attractions. These were the first pine saw logs cut in the St.\r\nCroix valley.\r\n\r\nIn 1838 a French trader, Robinet, was located at the same place, but\r\nin the summer of the same year came Mr. Jesse Taylor from Fort\r\nSnelling where he had been following the business of a stonemason. He\r\nhad heard of the ratification of the Indian treaty by Congress, and he\r\ngreatly coveted some of the rich lands brought into market by that\r\ntreaty. Mr. Taylor, with an Indian guide, came to the Dalles of the\r\nSt. Croix. As Mr. Steele had already claimed the east side, Mr. Taylor\r\nconcluded that he would claim the west side. Returning to Fort\r\nSnelling he reported to an associate, Benjamin F. Baker, formed a\r\npartnership and returned with men, boats, provisions and building\r\nmaterial, but on his return to the falls he found Robinet, the trader,\r\nin a bark shanty (at the present junction of Bridge and River\r\nstreets). Robinet was in actual possession of the coveted acres.\r\nRobinet having no other function than that of a trader, and\r\nconsequently having no serious designs on the lands was easily bought\r\noff, and Baker & Taylor, in August, 1838, commenced improvements,\r\nbuilding a log house, a blacksmith shop, a mill, and commencing a mill\r\nrace which had to be blasted. They also built piers and a wing dam\r\njust above the present location of the bridge. The mill was located at\r\nwhat has since become the upper steamboat landing. Mr. Taylor named\r\nthe lower falls Baker's falls, and the settlement, Taylor's Place.\r\nWhen the town was platted, in 1850, it was called Taylor's Falls. The\r\nname came also to be applied to the lower falls.\r\n\r\nThe mill enterprise was a melancholy failure. The builders were not\r\npractical mill men. The improvements were expensive. The work of\r\nblasting rock and building made slow progress. There was no income as\r\nlong as the mill was in process of building. In the midst of these\r\nembarrassments, in 1840, Mr. Baker died. Mr. Taylor took entire\r\npossession with no other right than that of a squatter sovereign. In\r\n1843 Mr. Taylor sold the unfinished mill to parties in Osceola, and in\r\n1844 everything movable was transferred to that place. The double log\r\ncabin remained, and there Mr. Taylor lived for eight years on the\r\nproceeds of the sale, performing in all that time no work more worthy\r\nof the historian's notice than fixing his name upon the settlement and\r\nfalls. Many of the later residents query as to why it was ever called\r\nTaylor's Falls. It takes a keen eye to discover any fall in the river\r\nat the point named. The falls indeed were once far more conspicuous\r\nthan they are now, owing to the fact that a large rock rose above the\r\nwater at the ordinary stage, around which the crowded waters roared\r\nand swirled. That rock, never visible in later days, was called Death\r\nRock, because three hapless mariners in a skiff were hurled against it\r\nby the swift current and drowned.\r\n\r\nThe old log house, the sole remnant of the Baker and Taylor project,\r\nif we may except some holes in the rock made by blasting, and some\r\nsubmerged ruins of the wing dam and pier, has passed through various\r\nchanges. It has been used as a store, as a boarding house, as a\r\nwarehouse, as a church, as a school house, and as a stable. Part of it\r\nstill remains and is habitable. It is located on lot 18, block 15. In\r\n1846 Jesse Taylor sold his claim to Joshua L. Taylor for two hundred\r\ndollars. This claim, like most of the claims made prior to the survey\r\nof government lands, was not accurately defined. It included, however,\r\nall the lands, on the west side of the river, extending northward to\r\nthe St. Croix Company's claim, at the upper falls, and including the\r\npresent site of Taylor's Falls.\r\n\r\nAside from mill building, nothing was done in the way of improvements\r\nuntil 1846, when Jerry Ross and Benjamin F. Otis commenced farming on\r\nwhat was subsequently known as the Morton and Colby farms. Both raised\r\npotatoes and garden vegetables and built houses. This was the first\r\ncultivation of the soil in Chisago county. In 1847 Mr. Otis sold his\r\nimprovements to Wm. F. Colby, who, in that year, raised the first corn\r\ngrown by white men in the county. In 1846 Thornton Bishop commenced\r\nimprovements on a farm at the head of the rapids, six miles above\r\nTaylor's Falls. J. L. Taylor, in 1848, built a pre-emption shanty\r\nmidway between the upper and lower falls. In 1849 he proved up his\r\npre-emption to lots 5, 6 and 7, section 30, township 34, range 18. N.\r\nC. D. Taylor pre-empted the northeast quarter of the southeast quarter\r\nof section 25, and the west half of the same quarter section; also lot\r\n1, section 36, township 34, range 19.\r\n\r\nIn 1849 Lewis Barlow and Wm. E. Bush became citizens. An abstract of\r\nthe canvassed returns of an election held November 26th shows but six\r\nvotes in the settlement. In 1850 W. F. Colby pre-empted the northeast\r\nquarter of section 25, township 34, range 19, and W. H. C. Folsom the\r\nsoutheast quarter of the southeast quarter of the same.\r\n\r\nAt a regular meeting of the St. Croix county board, held at\r\nStillwater, April 2, 1850, the following judges of election were\r\nappointed within the present limits of Chisago county: St. Croix Falls\r\nprecinct, Wm. F. Colby, Wm. Holmes, N. C. D. Taylor; Rush Lake\r\nprecinct, Levi Clark, Walter Carrier and Richard Arnold. At a meeting,\r\nheld Oct. 7, 1850, the petition of Lewis Barlow and ten others, of St.\r\nCroix Falls precinct, was presented, asking for a special election, to\r\nelect two justices of the peace. Their petition was granted. The poll\r\nwas: Wm. E. Bush, one vote; John H. Reid, six votes; Ansel Smith, five\r\nvotes. Reid and Smith were declared elected. The first survey of town\r\nlots was made in 1851, by Theodore E. Parker, of Stillwater, and under\r\nthis survey the village was legally established as Taylor's Falls. The\r\nfirst deeds recorded in Chisago county were transcripts from\r\nWashington county of lands consisting of town site property, dated\r\n1851, conveyed to W. H. C. Folsom by J. L. and N. C. D. Taylor.\r\n\r\nThe movement for the organization of a new county from the northern\r\npart of Washington commenced in the winter of 1851-52. A formidable\r\npetition to the legislature to make such organization, drawn up and\r\ncirculated by Hon. Ansel Smith, of Franconia, and the writer, was duly\r\nforwarded, presented and acquiesced in by that body. The writer had\r\nbeen selected to visit the capital in the interest of the petitioners.\r\nSome difficulty arose as to the name. The writer had proposed\r\n\"Chi-sa-ga.\" This Indian name was ridiculed, and Hamilton, Jackson,\r\nFranklin and Jefferson were in turn proposed. The committee of the\r\nwhole finally reported in favor of the name, Chisaga, but the\r\nlegislature, in passing the bill for our county organization, by\r\nclerical or typographical error changed the last \"a\" in \"saga\" to \"o,\"\r\nwhich, having become the law, has not been changed.\r\n\r\nThe eastern boundary of the county was fixed as the St. Croix river;\r\nthe southern boundary, the line between townships 32 and 33; the\r\nwestern, the line between ranges 21 and 22, for three townships south,\r\nand the line between ranges 22 and 23 for the remaining townships\r\nnorth. To show how little was known of the geography of the section we\r\nrefer to the record of the county commissioners of Washington county,\r\ndated Dec. 15, 1848, at which St. Croix district, the present Chisago\r\ncounty, was established as \"bounded on the north by Sunrise river and\r\non the west by line between ranges 21 and 22\"--an utter impossibility,\r\nas the Sunrise river flows in a northerly direction entirely through\r\nthe county and at its nearest point does not come within three miles\r\nof the range line mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe election for the first board of county officers was held at the\r\nChisago House, Oct. 14, 1851. Twenty-three votes were polled at this\r\nelection. The following officers were elected: Commissioners, Samuel\r\nThomson, chairman; N. C. D. Taylor, Thomas F. Morton; clerk of board\r\nand register of deeds, F. W. Abbott; treasurer, W. H. C. Folsom. The\r\nbill establishing the county provided that \"the seat of justice of the\r\ncounty of Chisago shall be at such point in said county as the first\r\nboard of commissioners elected in said county shall determine.\" In\r\naccordance with this law, at the first meeting of the commissioners,\r\nheld at the office of N. C. D. Taylor in Taylor's Falls, Jan. 5, 1852,\r\nthe town of Taylor's Falls was chosen as the county seat, \"agreeable\r\nto the Revised Statutes, chapter 1st, section 14th.\"\r\n\r\nAs the population of the county increased the project of moving the\r\ncounty seat to a more nearly central position was agitated. In 1858 a\r\nvote was taken which resulted in favor of its removal to Centre City.\r\nThe matter of the legality of the vote was referred to the court, and\r\ndecided by Judge Welch adversely, on the ground that a majority of the\r\nvoters of the county had not voted. The county seat consequently\r\nremained at Taylor's Falls. In 1861 another vote was taken by which\r\nthe county seat was removed to Chisago City, and there it remained\r\nunder somewhat adverse circumstances. Chisago City having but a small\r\npopulation and no conveniences for such a purpose, and being for\r\nseveral years without even a post office, repeated efforts were made\r\nfor another removal, until in 1875 a vote to remove it to Centre City\r\ncarried. In January, 1876, the records were removed. The county\r\nauthorities issued $5,000 bonds for a court house which was erected on\r\na point of land extending into Chisago lake, a beautiful situation.\r\nThe bonds have been paid and the county is without indebtedness, and\r\nhas a surplus of about $10,000.\r\n\r\nThe town of Amador comprises two eastern tiers of sections of township\r\n35, range 20, and two fractional sections of township 36, range 20,\r\nfractional township 35, range 19, and one fractional section of\r\ntownship 36, range 19. The St. Croix river forms its boundary on the\r\nnorth and east. The surface is undulating. The western and southern\r\npart is covered with hardwood timber and has rich soil. The northern\r\npart has oak openings and prairie, with soil somewhat varied, in some\r\nplaces more or less sandy. It is well watered and drained. Thornton\r\nBishop, the first settler, came in 1846, and located a farm on the\r\nbanks of the St. Croix, at the head of the rapids, in section 34.\r\nRichard Arnold settled on Amador prairie in 1854, and was followed by\r\nJames P. Martin, Carmi P. Garlick and others. Garlick was a practicing\r\nphysician, but engaged in other work. He built a steam saw mill and\r\nmade many other improvements, among them laying out the village of\r\nAmador in section 9, township 35, range 20. H. N. Newbury, surveyor,\r\nnot succeeding in his undertaking, issued the prospectus of a paper to\r\nbe called the _St. Croix Eagle_ and to be published at Taylor's Falls.\r\nThis failing he removed to Osceola.\r\n\r\nAmador was organized in 1858. The first supervisors were C. P.\r\nGarlick, R. Arnold and James Martin. A post office was established in\r\n1857; Henry Bush, postmaster. Mr. Bush had a small farm at the mouth\r\nof Deer creek, where he built a large public house, two stories high.\r\nThis house burned down. He established a ferry across the St. Croix.\r\nHe had a large family of boys who roamed the woods freely until one of\r\ntheir number was lost. The other boys came home as usual but of one\r\nthey could give no account. Parties were organized for the search,\r\nwhich at last was given up as unsuccessful. A year afterward the bones\r\nof the missing boy were found some miles away, by the side of a log,\r\nwhere the little wanderer had doubtless perished of starvation and\r\nexposure. Mr. Bishop raised the first crops of the town. The first\r\nmarriage was that of Charles S. Nevers and Mary Snell, by John Winans,\r\nEsq., Feb. 23, 1860.\r\n\r\nTHORNTON BISHOP was a native of Indiana. He came to St. Croix Falls in\r\n1841 and was married to Delia Wolf in 1842, by Rev. W. D. Boutwell, at\r\nthe Pokegama mission. This wife was a well educated half-breed. They\r\nraised a large family of children. He came to Amador in 1846 and\r\nfarmed for some time at the head of the rapids, when he sold his farm\r\nand moved to Sunrise. In 1880 he removed to Kettle River station. In\r\n1883-84-85-86 he served as commissioner for Pine county.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM HOLMES came to Amador and settled on a farm at the head of the\r\nrapids in 1848. The farm is now held by John Dabney. Mr. Holmes\r\nmarried a sister of Mrs. Thornton Bishop. She was educated at\r\nPokegama mission. They raised a large family of children. In 1852 Mr.\r\nHolmes removed to Sunrise and thence to Trade River, Wisconsin, in\r\n1875, where he sickened. His brother-in-law, Bishop, came to his\r\nrelief, removed him to his own home and cared for him till he died,\r\nMay, 1876.\r\n\r\nJAMES M. MARTIN was one of the first settlers in Amador. He came\r\noriginally from Missouri, where he was married. He died July 17, 1887;\r\nMrs. Martin dying some years prior. Their sons are James M., Harvey,\r\nCharles, Isaac, and Theodore. Their daughters are Mrs. Cowan, Mrs.\r\nWilkes, Mrs. Nordine and Mrs. Lanon.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRANCH.\r\n\r\nThe town of Branch, occupying township 35, range 21, was set off from\r\nSunrise, and organized in 1872. The first supervisors were William\r\nWinston, Peter Delamater and Frank Knight. A post office was\r\nestablished in 1869; Geo. W. Flanders, postmaster. The surface is\r\nmostly undulating, and the soil a sandy loam. There are oak openings,\r\nand along the course of the north branch of the Sunrise river, which\r\nflows through the town from west to east, there are many excellent\r\nwild meadows. The north part originally contained pine forests; about\r\n5,000,000 feet have been cut away. Branch contains some pretty and\r\nwell cultivated farms. The St. Paul & Duluth railroad traverses the\r\ntown from south to north.\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTH BRANCH STATION.\r\n\r\nThe only village in the town of Branch was platted in January, 1870,\r\nthe proprietors being the Western Land Association, L. Mendenhall,\r\nagent. The plat includes the north half of the northwest quarter of\r\nsection 21, and the northeast quarter of section 20, township 35,\r\nrange 21. The first settler was G. M. Flanders, who opened a store\r\nhere in 1868, which was burned in 1869. Henry L. Ingalls erected a\r\ngood hotel and other buildings. In 1870 Gurley & Bros. established a\r\nstore; B. F. Wilkes built a hotel; Winston, Long & Co. established a\r\nstore. In 1874 J. F. F. Swanson built a flouring mill, which was\r\nburned in 1878. The loss was about $6,000, with but little insurance.\r\nThe village now contains two elevators, three hotels, six stores and\r\nthe usual proportion of dwellings. There are two churches, the\r\nEpiscopalian building, erected in 1883; and the Congregational, in\r\n1884. There is also a good school house. The village was incorporated\r\nin 1882. In December, 1884, the store of Singleton & Bonnafon was\r\nburned; loss estimated at $15,000, with but little insurance.\r\n\r\nHENRY L. INGALLS was born in Abingdon, Connecticut, in 1804. In 1832\r\nhe was married to Lavina L. Child, of Woodstock, Connecticut, and with\r\nhis wife and younger brother emigrated to Illinois, settling at\r\nChandler, Cass county. There he remained seventeen years, when, his\r\nimpaired health necessitating a change, with his son Henry he went to\r\nCalifornia. In 1853 he returned and settled on Sunrise prairie, then\r\nan unbroken wilderness. For seventeen years he lived on his farm and\r\nkept a popular country hotel. In 1870 he removed to North Branch and\r\nbuilt a large frame residence, where he lived until his death, which\r\noccurred Sept. 2, 1876. Mr. Ingalls left three sons, Ephraim, Henry\r\nand Van Rensselaer.\r\n\r\nMRS. LAVINA L. INGALLS, whose maiden name was Childs, was born in\r\nConnecticut in 1806; was married as above stated in 1832, from which\r\ntime she cheerfully and uncomplainingly shared the fortunes of her\r\nhusband in the West, undergoing the usual toils and privations of the\r\npioneer. While at Sunrise, during part of the time she had no\r\nneighbors nearer than Taylor's Falls. The first post office in Chisago\r\ncounty north of Taylor's Falls was at her house, and was known as\r\nMuscotink. She and her husband, during the later years of their lives,\r\nwere Spiritualists, and derived great comfort from their peculiar\r\nphase of belief. Mrs. Ingalls was a talented and kind hearted woman,\r\ncharitable in act and beloved by her associates. She died Dec. 29,\r\n1879.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHISAGO LAKE.\r\n\r\nThe town of Chisago Lake includes the four western tiers of sections\r\nof township 33, range 20, and township 34, range 20. A permanent\r\ncharacteristic of this town is its unrivaled lake scenery, rendering\r\nit not only attractive for residences but a favorite resort of\r\nvisitors. Its principal lake has already been described. The first\r\nsettler was John S. Van Rensselaer, who located on an island opposite\r\nthe present site of Centre City in the spring of 1851, and raised a\r\ncrop of corn and vegetables. He built him a cabin and lived there\r\nthree years. Eric Norberg, a prominent Swede, came to the lake from\r\nBishop's Hill, Illinois, in April, 1851, and being pleased with the\r\nlocality, came back with a colony of Swedes, including Peter Berg,\r\nAndrew Swenson, Peter Anderson, Peter Shaline, Daniel Rattick, and\r\nothers. They came by steamboat, landed at Taylor's Falls June 24,\r\n1851, cut a road to Chisago lake and took undisputed possession of its\r\nshores, finding no trace of human occupancy save some deserted Indian\r\ntepees and the claim cabin of Mr. Van Rensselaer on the island. Mr.\r\nBerg settled on the west part of lot 3, section 35, and southwest\r\nquarter of southwest quarter of section 26, township 34, range 20.\r\nPeter Anderson on the east part of lot 3, and northwest quarter of\r\nnortheast quarter of section 35, township 34, range 20. Andrew Swenson\r\non lot 5, section 27, township 34, range 20. Mr. Norberg had come\r\nfirst to the country at the invitation of Miles Tornell, who was\r\nmurdered in 1848, near St. Croix Falls, by some Indian assassins,\r\nhired to commit the deed by one Miller, a whisky seller. Mr. Norberg\r\noriginally intended to make his home at Chisago Lake, but died at\r\nBishop's Hill, Illinois, while on a visit in 1853.\r\n\r\nThe colony in 1852 raised the first rye, barley and flax in the\r\ncounty. They also raised potatoes, green corn and vegetables, cut out\r\nroads, cleared timber, and made other improvements. Peter Berg raised\r\nflax and made linen thread in 1852, the first made in Minnesota.\r\nSettlers came in rapidly. Among the arrivals in 1852 and soon after\r\nwere the Petersons, Strands, Johnsons, Frank Mobeck, Dahliam, Porter,\r\nand others. A post office was established in 1858; A. Nelson,\r\npostmaster. The town was organized in 1858. The first supervisors\r\nwere: Ephraim C. Ingalls, chairman; Frank Mobeck and Daniel Lindstrom.\r\n\r\nThe first church organization in the county was that of the Swedish\r\nEvangelical Lutheran, in 1854. Here was built the first church edifice\r\nin 1855, a frame structure subsequently enlarged, but in 1882\r\nsuperseded by a fine brick building, costing $30,000. Its dimensions\r\nare 116 × 66 feet, ground plan, and the spire is 135 feet in height. A\r\nfine organ was purchased at a cost of $1,500. This church building is\r\nan ornament to the town and the State, and would be creditable even to\r\nour great cities. The first pastor was Rev. P. A. Cedarstam. His\r\nsuccessors are Revs. C. A. Hedengrand and John J. Frodeen, the present\r\nincumbent. The communicants number about 1,300.\r\n\r\nIn 1880 the St. Paul & Duluth railroad extended a branch road from\r\nWyoming to Taylor's Falls. This passes through the town of Chisago\r\nLake, from west to east, crossing three arms of the lake. To secure\r\nthis road the town gave $10,000 in twenty year bonds. It obtains in\r\nexchange an outlet for the products of its farms and forests. The\r\nbridge across Chisago lake was built in 1857, at a cost of $1,500. It\r\nhas since been made an embankment bridge at an additional cost of\r\n$1,600. Of this the State furnished $1,000 and the county $600.\r\n\r\n\r\nCENTRE CITY,\r\n\r\nThe county seat of Chisago county, was platted May, 1857, on lot 5,\r\nsection 27, township 34, range 20; Andrew Swenson, proprietor; Alex.\r\nCairns, surveyor. It is located on a peninsula midway on the east\r\nshore of Chisago lake. Few villages are more beautifully situated. It\r\ncontains two hotels, three stores, a saw and feed mill, two church\r\nbuildings, a Swedish Lutheran and Swedish Methodist, a school house\r\nand many pleasant residences. The court house was built in 1876, at a\r\ncost of $5,000, on a promontory commanding a fine view of the lake.\r\nThe depot of the branch of the St. Paul & Duluth railroad is located\r\nhalf a mile south of the village. Summer excursionists assemble here\r\nin goodly numbers, and the location bids fair to become very\r\nattractive as a summer resort. During the Indian outbreak in 1862, and\r\nthe period of uncertainty as to the probable attitude of the Chippewa\r\nIndians, the people of Chisago Lake built breastworks for protection,\r\non the isthmus connecting Centre City with the mainland, and planted\r\ncannon upon them for defense. The remains of these old fortifications\r\nmay still be seen.\r\n\r\nANDREW SWENSON.--Mr. Swenson, the founder of Centre City, came to the\r\nshores of the lake in 1851, and made his home on the present site of\r\nthe city. He was born in Sweden in 1817; came to America in 1850, and\r\nremained a short time in New Orleans before coming to Minnesota. He\r\nwas a farmer and a member of the Methodist church. He was married to\r\nCatharine Peterson in 1838. He died in July, 1887, leaving two sons\r\nand two daughters.\r\n\r\nJOHN S. VAN RENSSELAER came to Chisago Lake in the spring of 1851, and\r\nsettled on an island, where he lived three years in hermit-like\r\nseclusion, raising corn and vegetables. His cabin, always neat and\r\ntasteful, was furnished with a choice library. In 1854 he removed to\r\nSunrise Lake, where he lived fifteen years, engaged in farming. He\r\nremoved thence to Sunrise City. Mr. Van Rensselaer was the founder of\r\nthe first cheese factories in the county, at Sunrise City and Centre\r\nCity. He is an honorable and upright man, whose high aim is to\r\nexemplify the golden rule in his life and deportment.\r\n\r\nAXEL DAHLIAM settled on the west shore of East Chisago lake in 1852.\r\nMr. Dahliam had been an officer in the Swedish Army. He was a\r\ncultivated gentleman. He died in 1869.\r\n\r\nNELS NORD was born in Lindhopsing, Sweden, in 1819. In his eighteenth\r\nyear he enlisted in the Swedish Army and served twelve years. He came\r\nto America in 1855 and located on Chisago lake, in the northeast\r\nquarter of section 32, township 34, range 20. He was married in Sweden\r\nto Lisa Anderson. They have one son, John P., who has been for seven\r\nyears the popular and efficient auditor of Chisago county. He was\r\nmarried in 1878 to Hildah, daughter of Rev. C. A. Hedengrand. They\r\nhave one daughter.\r\n\r\nJOHN A. HALLBERG was born at Smolland, Sweden, in 1830. He came to\r\nAmerica in 1853 and to Centre City in 1854. In 1872 he purchased a saw\r\nand feed mill of Shogren Brothers. In 1876 he built a hotel. He has\r\nheld the office of justice of the peace many years and has served four\r\nyears as county commissioner. He was married to Matilda E. Carlson in\r\n1870.\r\n\r\nCHAS. A. BUSH is of German descent. His father, Wm. H. Bush, lived in\r\nWyoming. His great grandfather came to this country in 1765 and fought\r\non the side of the colonies. Chas. A. came to Minnesota in 1869 from\r\nPennsylvania. He has served as treasurer of Chisago county four years.\r\n\r\nLARS JOHAN STARK was born in Sweden in 1826; came to America in 1850,\r\nand settled at Chisago Lake in 1852. He was married in 1865, and again\r\nin 1870. He has eleven children living. In Sweden he served as clerk\r\nten years. In his American home he has followed farming chiefly. He\r\nhas served as justice of the peace and county commissioner, and has\r\nfilled some town offices. He was engrossing clerk of the house of\r\nrepresentatives in 1864. He was a member of the house in the sessions\r\nof 1865 and 1875. In 1868 he moved to the town of Fish Lake, and in\r\n1877 to Harris.\r\n\r\nFRANK MOBECK was born in Sweden in 1814. He came to America in 1851,\r\nand in 1853 to Chisago Lake, where he settled on lot 5, section 34,\r\ntownship 34, range 20. His home is on a beautiful elevation, on a\r\npoint of land projecting into the lake. Mr. Mobeck served in the\r\nSwedish Army seventeen years. He has raised a large family of\r\nchildren, all of whom are good citizens.\r\n\r\nROBERT CURRIE was born in Ayrshire, Scotland. After reaching manhood\r\nhe was employed many years as superintendent of a fancy manufacturing\r\ncompany. He was married in Scotland. In 1854, after the death of his\r\nwife, he came to America, and in 1855 selected a place for a home on\r\nthe north shore of west Chisago lake, where he lived till his death by\r\ndrowning in 1883. The site of his home was well chosen. It commanded a\r\nbeautiful view of the lake, and in the summer months was luxuriantly\r\nadorned with flowers. Mr. Currie was a man of fine intellect, well\r\ncultivated, and an ardent admirer of his countryman Burns, from whom,\r\nand from Shakespeare and other masters of English literature he could\r\nquote for hours. Mr. Currie's occupation was farming, but he filled\r\nseveral offices acceptably. He was superintendent of schools, judge of\r\nprobate and clerk of district court. Though somewhat eccentric, he was\r\na social, kind hearted man.\r\n\r\nANDREW N. HOLM, formerly Andrew Nelson, his name having been changed\r\nby legislative enactment in 1867, was born in Sweden in 1829. He\r\nlearned the trade of carpenter, came to America in 1855 and located in\r\nCentre City in 1857, of which city he was first postmaster. He served\r\nas a soldier during the Civil War and at its close removed his family\r\nto Taylor's Falls, which is still his home.\r\n\r\n\r\nLINDSTROM VILLAGE,\r\n\r\nLocated on the line of the Taylor's Falls branch of the St. Paul &\r\nDuluth railroad, on lot 4, section 33, town 34, range 20, was platted\r\nin 1880 by G. W. Sewall, surveyor. The proprietors are James and\r\nElisabeth Smith. It is situated on high ground and almost surrounded\r\nby the waters of Lake Chisago. It would be difficult to find a\r\nlovelier site. Maurice Tombler built the first store and elevator\r\nhere, in 1881. There are now three stores, one hotel, one railroad\r\nstation and several shops and dwellings. A post office was established\r\nat Lindstrom in 1880; Charles H. Bush, postmaster.\r\n\r\nDANIEL LINDSTROM was born in 1825, in Helsingland, Sweden. He had no\r\nearly advantages for obtaining an education, and spent most of his\r\nyouth herding goats amongst the mountains in the north part of Sweden.\r\nIn 1854 he came to America and located on Chisago lake, choosing a\r\nbeautiful location, which has since been laid out as a village, and\r\nbids fair to become a place of popular resort. Mr. Lindstrom was\r\nmarried first in Sweden, and now lives with his second wife, the first\r\nhaving died in 1864. He has a family of three children. He has filled\r\nofficial positions in his town acceptably.\r\n\r\nMAGNUS S. SHALEEN was born in Sweden in 1796; came to America in 1855,\r\nand made a homestead near Lindstrom in section 29, town 34, range 20,\r\nwhere he died in 1869. Mrs. Shaleen died in 1873. John, the oldest\r\nson, resides on the family homestead. He has served as sheriff of\r\nChisago county six years, and state senator eight years. Peter, the\r\nsecond son, has served as postmaster of Centre City fourteen years,\r\nand clerk of the district court five years. Sarah, the eldest\r\ndaughter, married John Swenson. They have three sons, John H., Henry\r\nA. and Oscar, industrious, reliable young men, all in the employ of\r\nthe St. Paul & Duluth Railroad Company. Mary married Andrew Wallmark\r\nat Chisago Lake, in 1856. One daughter is unmarried.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHISAGO CITY.\r\n\r\nThe village of Chisago City is located on a hardwood ridge, between\r\nChisago and Green lakes, in sections 6 and 7, township 34, range 20.\r\nIt was platted by Isaac Bernheimer & Co., of Philadelphia, on lot 4,\r\nsection 7, township 34, range 20, in 1855. They built a hotel, several\r\ndwellings, and a saw and grist mill on the banks of Chisago lake, at\r\nan expense of about $7,000. These mills were burned in 1872. A stave\r\nfactory was built on the site of the burned mills, which was operated\r\nsuccessfully for many years under the management of George Nathan,\r\nOtto Wallmark, W. D. Webb and others. This stave mill gave a new\r\nimpetus to the prosperity of the village, under the influence of which\r\nthe county seat was transferred to it. Its subsequent growth, however,\r\ndid not justify expectations. It was for many years without even a\r\npost office. In 1875 the county seat was removed to Centre City. The\r\nLutherans have here one of the finest church buildings in the county.\r\nThe branch railroad depot is located one mile north, and quite a\r\nvillage has grown up around it.\r\n\r\nOTTO WALLMARK was born Dec. 7, 1830, in the province of Halland,\r\nSweden. In his minority he was nine years clerk in a store. He\r\nreceived a common school education. In 1854 he came to America and\r\ndirectly to Chisago City, where he lived many years, making a\r\nhomestead, which has since been his permanent home. He served eighteen\r\nyears as Chisago county auditor. He served several years as postmaster\r\nat Chisago City, and in 1886 was elected state senator for four years.\r\nHis first wife was Mary Helene, his second wife, Eva Palmgreen. They\r\nhave one son and one daughter.\r\n\r\nANDREW WALLMARK, brother of Otto, was born in Sweden in 1826; received\r\na liberal education, and came to Chisago Lake from Sweden in 1854. He\r\nhas filled several town offices; has been register of deeds for\r\nChisago county nineteen years; was married to Mary Shaleen in 1856.\r\nThey have two sons and three daughters.\r\n\r\n\r\nFISH LAKE.\r\n\r\nThe town of Fish Lake includes township 36, range 22. It was\r\noriginally well timbered, chiefly with hardwood, but 25,000,000 feet\r\nof pine timber has been cut from it and mostly manufactured in the\r\ntown. There are some fine lakes in the town, of which the largest and\r\nfinest are Horseshoe and Cedar. The soil is black clay loam with\r\nsubsoil of clay. The town was cut off from the town of Sunrise and\r\norganized in 1868. The first supervisors were Chas. F. Stark, Benjamin\r\nFranklin and John A. Hokanson. A post office was established in 1868;\r\nBenjamin Franklin, postmaster. The first settlers were Peter Olaf and\r\nPeter Bergland, in section 25. The first school was taught by Miss\r\nMattison. The first marriage was that of John Hokanson and Matilda\r\nSamuelson. The first death was that of John Erickson. The population\r\nis mostly from Sweden. There is a good Swedish Lutheran church built\r\nnear the centre of the town. There are also a Swedish Methodist and a\r\nSwedish Baptist society. The people are a well-to-do, independent\r\nclass. Fish Lake has a saw mill with a capacity of about 1,000,000\r\nfeet. In 1877 Hosburg, the watchman of this mill, was killed by\r\nPriestly, an Englishman. Hosburg, in accordance with the rules, had\r\nordered him not to smoke on the premises. The Englishman was arrested,\r\ntried for murder and acquitted.\r\n\r\nPETER BERG was born in Sweden in 1801; came to America in 1850, and\r\nsettled at Chisago Lake in 1851. Some time subsequently he settled on\r\nthe north shore of Fish lake. In 1886, at the age of eighty-five\r\nyears, he is still a vigorous, active man. Mr. Berg was married in\r\nSweden. He has one daughter, Katharine, who married Sam Hamilton, of\r\nTaylor's Falls. Mr. Hamilton died in 1871. She married as her second\r\nhusband Swain G. Yongren.\r\n\r\nBENJAMIN FRANKLIN, though he bears the name of America's most\r\nillustrious philosopher, is a native of Sweden, whence he came with a\r\nSwedish colony in 1852, settled at Taylor's Falls, and subsequently\r\nremoved to the northern shore of Fish lake. By way of explaining how\r\nhe came by his American name we add that soon after his arrival he\r\ncame to the writer somewhat puzzled as to how he should write his\r\nSwedish name in English. He gave it as \"Ben Franz Norel,\" but\r\npronounced it in such a way that it sounded rather like Benjamin\r\nFranklin. We suggested that name as a happy solution of the\r\ndifficulty, telling him something about the illustrious man who had\r\nmade it honorable. He adopted it at once, and has never disgraced it.\r\nHe is still a worthy, industrious and honorable citizen of Fish Lake.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCONIA\r\n\r\nIncludes the two eastern tiers of sections of township 33, range 20,\r\nand fractional township 33, range 19, including about fifteen whole\r\nsections, and four fractional. The soil is good, and originally\r\nsupported a growth of hardwood. The surface is undulating. It is well\r\nwatered by Lawrence and several other small creeks tributary to the\r\nSt. Croix, and has several small but clear lakes. Ansel Smith was the\r\nfirst settler of the town and village, which he named after Franconia\r\nin the White mountains. He came here in 1852, and located a claim on\r\nthe present site of the village, on the St. Croix river, section 10,\r\ntownship 33, range 19. He did much for the prosperity of the village\r\nand town. He raised the first crops and was the first postmaster\r\n(1854). The town was organized in 1858. The first supervisors were\r\nAnsel Smith, Leonard P. Day and A. J. Adams. The town is now well\r\nsettled and has many excellent farms. The branch St. Paul & Duluth\r\nrailroad has a depot three-fourths of a mile from the village of\r\nFranconia. A German Methodist church is located near the centre of the\r\ntown.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCONIA VILLAGE\r\n\r\nWas platted in 1858, by Ansel Smith. It was incorporated in 1884. Paul\r\nMunch, in 1860, erected a first class, three storied flouring mill on\r\nLawrence creek. A saw mill, erected in 1854 by the Clark brothers and\r\nAnsel Smith, has passed through many changes of ownership. It is now\r\nthe property of Matthews & Jourdain. Henry F. and Leonard P. Day built\r\nthe first good dwelling in the village, on the banks of the St. Croix,\r\njust above the steamboat landing. Margaret Smith taught the first\r\nschool. The first death in the village was that of Neil Monroe.\r\n\r\nANSEL SMITH came from Vermont to St. Croix Falls in 1850 and engaged\r\nin teaching.

He was an\r\nenergetic, active business man, and took an interest not only in the\r\naffairs of his town and neighborhood, but in the country at large. He\r\nrepresented his district in the fifth, sixth and seventh legislatures.\r\nHe was appointed register of the United States land office at Duluth\r\nin 1870 and served till 1872. Mr. Smith died at his residence in\r\nDuluth in 1878, leaving a wife and three promising sons, two of them\r\npracticing attorneys in Duluth; one cashier of a bank in Duluth.\r\n\r\nHENRY F.

Mr. Peterson owns one of the finest houses in the valley,\r\nromantically situated, which is supplied with pure spring water. It is\r\na pride to the village and attracts general attention. He is also the\r\ninventor and patentee of the Lindholm & Peterson adding machine.\r\n\r\n\r\nHARRIS.\r\n\r\nThe town of Harris contains twenty-four sections of township 36, range\r\n21, the four western tiers of sections. The soil is a sandy loam with\r\nclay subsoil. The town is well watered and drained by Goose creek,\r\nwhich entering the town from the northwest, and bending at first\r\nsouthward, then eastward, leaves the town near its southeastern line\r\nin section 22. The timber consisted originally of oak openings and\r\npine; 10,000,000 feet of the latter have been removed from the\r\nsoutheastern portion. Luxuriant wild meadows are found along Goose\r\ncreek. The first improvement was a farm, made by W. H. C. Folsom in\r\nsections 21 and 22 in 1854. The first permanent settler was Henry H.\r\nSevy, who located on this farm in 1856. The town of Harris was\r\norganized in 1884.\r\n\r\n\r\nHARRIS VILLAGE.\r\n\r\nA charter organizing Harris village was granted by the district court,\r\nunder the general law, in 1882. A question arose as to the legality of\r\nthe act. A subsequent legislature, by legislative act, confirmed all\r\nsimilarly organized villages in the State. The supreme court decided\r\nthe organization of such villages illegal and the legislative act\r\nsanctioning it unconstitutional. It was subsequently organized\r\nlegally. The village was surveyed by A. D. Miller and platted in May,\r\n1873, in the south half of section 21, township 36, range 21, Philip\r\nS. Harris and N. D. Miller, proprietors. It derived its name from\r\nPhilip S. Harris, a prominent officer of the St. Paul & Duluth\r\nrailroad. Fred Wolf was the first settler, in 1870, and first merchant\r\nand first railroad agent, in 1873. He acted as postmaster subsequently\r\nand filled other offices of trust. His interests are intimately\r\nblended with those of the village. Isaac Savage was the second settler\r\nand merchant. He was the first postmaster, in 1873. The first school\r\nwas taught by Mary Gwinn, in 1873. The first marriage was that of M.\r\nP. Smith and Charlotte Swenson. The first child born was Brague, son\r\nof W. D. Sayers.

The town was organized in 1872. The first\r\nsupervisors were Dawson, Moore and Robinson. The first post office was\r\nestablished in 1875, at Stacy, a railroad station on the St. Paul &\r\nDuluth railroad, which traverses this town from south to north. Frank\r\nDawson was the first postmaster.\r\n\r\n\r\nNESSELL.\r\n\r\nNessell includes township 37, range 22. The surface was originally\r\ncovered with a growth of hardwood, with some pine. Of the latter,\r\nabout 10,000,000 feet has been cut. The soil is adapted to wheat\r\nculture. It is well watered. Rush lake occupies a nearly central\r\nposition, and is a beautiful sheet of water with about fourteen miles\r\nof meandering shore line, crystal clear, and deep, well stocked with\r\nfish, and bordered with groves of maple, oak and linden. The town was\r\nset off from Rush Lake and organized in 1870. The first supervisors\r\nwere Wm. H. McCray, John H. Breit and Matts Colleen. The town is\r\nsettled by a class of industrious, upright people. There are three\r\nchurches, with prosperous societies, the Swedish Baptist, the Swedish\r\nLutheran and German Lutheran. Martin Linnell was the first child born.\r\nThe first marriage was that of Wm. Vanetta and Anna Johnson, in 1861.\r\nAlice Draper taught the first school. Rev. Cedarstam preached the\r\nfirst sermon.\r\n\r\nROBERT NESSELL was the oldest settler. The town was named for him. He\r\nwas born in Germany in 1834; came to America in 1847, and to Minnesota\r\nin 1854. He was married at Sunrise to Kate Torbert, of Shafer, in\r\n1856, and the same year located his present home. Other early settlers\r\nare John H. Breit, John Lindsey, P. Kelley, and the Jarchow brothers.\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN B. CLARK made Nessell his home in 1867. Mr. Clark was born in\r\nVermont in 1830; came to Marine in 1851. He served three years during\r\nthe Rebellion in the Second Wisconsin Cavalry. He removed to Rush City\r\nin 1856.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSH SEBA.\r\n\r\nRush Seba comprises township 37, range 21, and fractional part of\r\ntownship 37, range 20, consisting of about ten sections, irregularly\r\nbounded by the St. Croix river. It is timbered with hardwood, has good\r\nsoil, chiefly a black clay loam, with clay subsoil, and is well\r\nwatered by Rush river and Rock creek and tributaries. Wild meadows and\r\nmarshes are intermingled with the timber. The town was organized in\r\n1858, with George B. Folsom, Robert Newell and Timothy Ward as\r\nsupervisors. A post office was established in 1859, in section 14,\r\nGeorge B. Folsom, postmaster. George B. Folsom was the first settler,\r\nraising the first crops in the town in 1855. The St. Paul & Duluth\r\nrailroad traverses the town from south to north.

The first death\r\nwas that of James Ward, who died from accidental poisoning.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSH CITY.\r\n\r\nIn 1868, at the completion of the St. Paul & Duluth railroad, a depot\r\nwas built and a station established at the crossing of Rush river,\r\naround which rapidly grew up the village of Rush City. It was surveyed\r\nand platted by Benjamin W. Brunson, surveyor, in January, 1870, in the\r\nnortheast quarter of section 21, township 37, range 26. The Western\r\nLand Association, L. Mendenhall, agent, was proprietor. Thomas Flynn\r\nwas the first settler, he having in 1857 pre-empted the land which\r\nafterward became the site of the village. Among the improvements in\r\n1869 was a steam saw mill, built by Taylor & Co. This mill was burned\r\nin 1879, at a loss of $13,000. Rush City was incorporated in 1874.\r\nFrank H. Pratt was president of the first village council. Rush City\r\nhas now a commodious town hall, an exchange bank, one elevator, one\r\nfoundry, a good school house, built at a cost of $3,000; a good graded\r\nschool, under the supervision of Prof. V.

He came to\r\nAmerica in 1831, and lived in Canada East until 1857; when he located\r\nin Minnesota, pre-empting the northeast quarter of section 21,\r\ntownship 37, range 21. His farm became the site of the village of Rush\r\nCity in 1868, and in 1869 he built the first frame house in its\r\nlimits. Mr. Flynn has been married three times, losing each of his\r\nwives by death. He has two sons living, James H. and Frank A.\r\n\r\nPATRICK H.

Owens as assistant\r\neditor of the St. Paul _Minnesotian_. On Sunday, May 6, 1855, Mr.\r\nPratt went on board the steamer Royal Arch, which had landed at the\r\nSt. Paul levee that morning with a cargo of passengers, sick, dying\r\nand dead of cholera. Thirteen had already died on the boat. Mr.\r\nPratt, Sr., went on board to alleviate the sufferings of the sick and\r\ndying, and in consequence, within two days, himself sickened and died.\r\nThe writer and his family were passengers on the Royal Arch, and\r\nwitnesses to these scenes of suffering and death and Mr. Pratt's\r\nheroic self-devotion. After his father's death Frank continued in the\r\noffice of the _Minnesotian_ as printer. He worked also in the offices\r\nof the St. Paul and St. Peter _Tribune_ and the Prescott _Transcript_.\r\nIn 1858-59 he served as local editor and foreman in the _Transcript_\r\noffice.

EDDY was born in Java, Wyoming county, New York, Sept. 7,\r\n1840; received a common school education supplemented by two years'\r\nattendance at Griffith Institute, Springfield, New York; gave up his\r\nschool to enlist in his country's service, as a member of the\r\n\"Ellsworth Avengers\" (the Forty-fourth New York Volunteers). The\r\nregiment was mustered into service at Albany, New York, Aug. 8, 1861.\r\nHe served in this regiment until June 5, 1864, when he was taken\r\nprisoner at Old Church, Virginia. He endured the horrors of prison\r\nlife until Feb. 26, 1865, and was discharged from service May 20,\r\n1865. In 1868 he came to Taylor's Falls and engaged in teaching, which\r\nhe has made his profession, having taught continuously since 1869.

It was at first heavily timbered with\r\nhardwood, interspersed with marshes and meadows. The soil is good.\r\nLawrence and Dry creeks drain the greater part of the township. It is\r\nnow well settled, and has many fine farms. A Swedish colony settled\r\nhere in 1853, consisting of Peter Wyckland, Andros Anderson, Eric\r\nByland, Tuver Walmarson, and others. The town organized first as\r\nTaylor's Falls, but the name was changed to Shafer in 1873. John G.\r\nPeterson, John Nelson and John Carlson were the first supervisors. The\r\nfirst school was taught by Ella Wyckoff, in the Marshall district, in\r\n1859. The first marriage was that of Peter Abear to Kittie Wickland.\r\nThe branch St. Paul & Duluth railroad passes through the southern part\r\nof this township. The township contributed to this road $3,000 in\r\nbonds. A railroad station in the southwest quarter of section 32 bears\r\nthe name of Shafer, derived, together with the name of the township,\r\nfrom\r\n\r\nJACOB SHAFER, who, as early as 1847, cut hay in sections 4 and 5. He\r\nseems to have been in no sense worthy of the honor conferred upon him,\r\nas he was but a transient inhabitant, and disappeared in 1849. No one\r\nknows of his subsequent career. The honor ought to have been given to\r\nsome of the hardy Swedes, who were the first real pioneers, and the\r\nfirst to make substantial improvements.\r\n\r\nPETER WICKLAND came from Sweden in 1853, and settled in the northeast\r\nquarter of section 26. He moved to Anoka in 1860, and was drowned in\r\nRum river in 1880. His son Peter is a prominent merchant in Anoka.\r\n\r\nTUVER WALMARSON was born in Sweden in 1812. He was a member of the\r\nSwedish colony of 1853, settled in the northwest quarter of section\r\n26. Mr. and Mrs. Walmarson reared a fine family of children. Nelson\r\nTuver Walmarson, the eldest son, inherits the industry and frugality\r\nof both parents. By hard work and close attention to business the\r\nfamily has prospered abundantly.\r\n\r\nANDROS ANDERSON came also from Sweden in 1853 and settled in the east\r\nhalf of the northeast quarter of section 34. Mr. Anderson moved to\r\nTaylor's Falls in 1859 and died there in 1873. He left but one child,\r\nthe wife of Daniel Fredine, of Shafer. Mr. Anderson was a born\r\nhumorist and fond of practical jokes. On one occasion his ready wit\r\nwas exercised at the expense of a man to whom he had mortgaged his\r\nfarm. Deeming the house in which he lived his own, in the absence of\r\nthe mortgagee he removed it to Taylor's Falls. The mortgagee, E. W.\r\nHolman, told him that he had stolen the house and must replace it.\r\nAnderson told Holman to take the house and replace it himself, but if\r\nhe took his (Anderson's) family along with it he would have him sent\r\nto the penitentiary. Mr. Holman did not see his way clear and the\r\nhouse was not disturbed.\r\n\r\nERIC BYLAND, another of the Swedish colony, settled in the west half\r\nof the southeast quarter of section 23. In 1860 he sold out and moved\r\nfurther west. The farm he left is now owned by John Nelson and is one\r\nof the finest farms in Chisago county.\r\n\r\nJACOB PETERSON was born in 1847 and came with his parents to Chisago\r\ncounty in 1854. They located on a beautiful spot in Franconia, on the\r\nshore of a small lake, where they made a farm and where Jacob passed\r\nhis boyhood and youth. In 1881 he commenced business at Shafer station\r\nas a merchant and dealer in wood. He was the first postmaster at\r\nShafer. He was married in 1881 to Mary Heline.\r\n\r\nAMBROSE C. SEAVEY was born in Machias, Maine, in 1824; was married to\r\nElizabeth Ayers, in Crawford, Maine, in 1846, and came to St. Croix\r\nFalls in 1848. In 1852 he removed to Taylor's Falls, and opened the\r\nfirst blacksmith shop. He was absent two years in Colorado, and when\r\nhe returned settled on a farm in the town of Shafer. He has a family\r\nof four sons and six daughters.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUNRISE.\r\n\r\nThe town of Sunrise includes the two eastern tiers of sections of\r\ntownship 36, range 21, one whole and eight fractional sections of\r\ntownship 36, range 20, and all of township 35, range 20, except the\r\ntwo eastern tiers of sections. It is well watered by the St. Croix and\r\nSunrise rivers and their tributaries. The latter river rises in\r\nWashington county, having for its principal source Forest lake, and\r\nflows through the town in a northerly direction into the St. Croix. It\r\nhas three considerable tributaries from the west known as North,\r\nMiddle and South branches. St. Croix river has, as tributary, Goose\r\ncreek, which flows through the northern part of the town. The soil\r\nvaries from a rich sandy loam to a sandy soil. The town contains many\r\nfine farms. The old government road from Point Douglas to Superior\r\npasses through the town.\r\n\r\nSunrise was incorporated as a town Oct. 26, 1858; Isaac A. Parmenter,\r\nDavid Lovejoy and A. C. Mattison, supervisors. A post office was\r\nestablished in 1856; George S. Frost, postmaster. The first marriage\r\nwas that of Robert Nessell and Kate Torbert, by J. D. Wilcox, Esq. The\r\nfirst child born was Joshua Taylor Gallaspie. The first death was of\r\nan unknown man who died from the kick of a horse. Wm. Holmes, the\r\nfirst settler, located on Sunrise prairie in 1853, and raised crops on\r\nfifteen acres that year. John A. Brown and Patten W. Davis cultivated\r\nthirty-five acres the same year on Sunrise prairie. Messrs. Brown,\r\nDavis and Ingalls made a wagon road from Sunrise to St. Paul in 1853.\r\nJohn A. Brown, in the same year, built a hotel and opened a store. The\r\nhotel was built of logs, the store was a frame, the first erected in\r\nSunrise. In 1855 he built a saw mill. His hotel was burned in 1856.\r\nThese buildings were the nucleus of Sunrise village.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUNRISE VILLAGE\r\n\r\nWas platted July, 1857, in the north half of the northeast quarter of\r\nsection 8, and the west half of the southwest quarter and the\r\nnortheast quarter of the southeast quarter of section 4, and the\r\nsoutheast quarter of the southwest quarter of section 9, all of\r\ntownship 3, range 20. The proprietors were John A. Brown, J. S.\r\nCaldwell and C. L. Willis; surveyor, W. F. Duffy. It contains a first\r\nclass roller flour mill, a saw mill, both owned by Caspar Spivac, two\r\nstores, a school house and several shops and dwellings. In 1857 a\r\ncolony from Western New York settled in and around Sunrise village.\r\nThe Wilcoxes, Wilkes, Collins, Gwynne, Smith, and others were of this\r\ncolony. The village has suffered greatly from fires. The buildings\r\nlost at various times were one flouring mill, valued at $10,000, four\r\nhotels and several private dwellings. The flouring mill was the\r\nproperty of Mrs. J. G. Mold. Two lives were lost at the burning of the\r\nmill.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1862, immediately after the Sioux outbreak, and while\r\nconsiderable apprehension was felt as to the attitude of the Chippewas\r\ntoward the white settlers, a company of volunteers under Capt.\r\nAnderson was stationed at Sunrise. This company built temporary\r\nquarters of logs, and were very comfortably fixed during the winter.\r\nThey had presumably a very good time, but repelled no savage foes.\r\n\r\n\r\nKOST VILLAGE\r\n\r\nIs located in the west half of section 32, township 35, range 20. It\r\nhas a first class roller flouring mill, owned by Ferdinand A. Kost,\r\nerected in 1883 at a cost of $13,000, and a saw mill, also owned by F.\r\nA. Kost, erected the same year. It has two stores, a number of shops\r\nand dwellings and a post office, established in 1884, of which F. A.\r\nKost is postmaster.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHIPPEWA\r\n\r\nWas platted March, 1856, by Benj. Dinsmore, surveyor, in the northwest\r\nquarter of section 2, and the west half of the northeast quarter of\r\nsection 2, township 36, range 21. The proprietors were James Starkey,\r\nCharles S.

Caldwell and\r\nL. C. Kinney. On this site the Starkey Indian battle was fought.\r\n\r\nJOHN A. BROWN.--Mr. Brown, a native of Pennsylvania, came to Sunrise\r\nin 1853, and was for awhile quite prominent, building a store, hotel\r\nand other buildings. In 1855 he was married to Emeline Hartwell. He\r\nprospered in business, but owing to some domestic difficulties, in\r\n1857 left suddenly for parts unknown. His property was sacrificed to\r\nmeet obligations, and his wife left helpless. Mrs. Brown died in\r\nMinneapolis in 1880.\r\n\r\nPATTEN W. DAVIS was a native of Virginia. He came to Stillwater in\r\n1848, and soon after removed to Osceola Mills, where he lived two\r\nyears. In 1853 he removed to Sunrise, and was associated in business\r\nfor two years with John A. Brown. He has held the positions of\r\npostmaster, town clerk, treasurer, county commissioner, supervisor,\r\nand assessor. In 1876 he married a Virginia lady, and returned to his\r\nnative state.\r\n\r\nJAMES F. HARVEY was born in 1820, in Penobscot county, Maine. He came\r\nWest in 1847 and settled at Marine Mills. In 1854 he removed to\r\nSunrise and located in the northeast quarter of section 14, township\r\n36, range 21, at what was known as Goose Creek crossing. His first\r\nwife, whom he had married in Maine, died shortly after their arrival\r\nat Sunrise, leaving one daughter, Maria, wife of Leonard Clark, of\r\nStillwater. Mr. Harvey was married in 1856 to widow Patience Knight,\r\nthe mother of Mrs. Floyd S. Bates, Albert S. and Frank E., of Taylor's\r\nFalls, and Ella Medora Harvey, wife of J. A. Shores, of Minneapolis.\r\nMr. Harvey died at his home in 1864. Mrs. Harvey died at Taylor's\r\nFalls in 1871.\r\n\r\nFLOYD S.

He has three children. His eldest, a daughter, wife of\r\nSamuel McClure, a lumberman of Sunrise, died February, 1885. Mr.\r\nWarner removed to Dakota in 1883.\r\n\r\nCHARLES F. LOWE was born in 1815 in Concord, New Hampshire, received a\r\ncollegiate education and came to Sunrise in 1855. He interested\r\nhimself in real estate but devoted about one-half of his time to\r\ntravel, of which he was passionately fond. He made one trip around the\r\nglobe, writing back interesting letters descriptive of what he had\r\nseen. He made his last annual tour in 1873, and, while sailing in a\r\nsmall boat in some of the waters of Florida, the boat was struck by a\r\nsquall, capsized and Mr. Lowe was drowned. Mr. Lowe was a member of\r\nthe Minnesota constitutional convention.\r\n\r\nWELLS FARR came from New York State to Sunrise prairie in 1854, where\r\nhe has since lived in a comfortable home, a successful farmer. He has\r\na family of four sons and two daughters. His oldest daughter is the\r\nwife of Ephraim C. Ingalls. His second daughter is the wife of Frank\r\nDawson, of Lent. Mr. Farr died in March, 1888.\r\n\r\nJOHN G. MOLD came to Sunrise in 1854, where he engaged in milling,\r\nhotel keeping and mercantile business. He was the proprietor of the\r\nSunrise City mills, since burned. He died in 1873, aged fifty years,\r\nleaving a widow, two sons and two daughters.\r\n\r\nGEORGE L. BLOOD, during his early life, was a seafaring man, spending\r\nmany years upon the ocean, and visiting during this time many foreign\r\nports, keeping a daily record of his journeyings. Mr. Blood had\r\nlearned the trade of house joiner, but coming to Sunrise in 1854,\r\nattempted farming, at which he was not successful. In 1864 he removed\r\nto Taylor's Falls, where he died in 1869. His life was an exemplary\r\none, and his death that of a Christian. His family returned to their\r\nold home in Connecticut. His two sons reside in St. Paul.\r\n\r\nJOEL G. RYDER came from New York to the St. Croix and settled in the\r\ntown of Sunrise, near the village, about the year 1855. He was\r\nenergetic and able, and was called to fill many town and county\r\noffices. He was a representative in the fifteenth state legislature.\r\nIn 1860 he was married to Lizzie Perkins.\r\n\r\nJOHN DEAN was born in 18--; was married to Mary Draper in 1860; came\r\nto Minnesota in 18--; served some time as river pilot, and settled on\r\nhis farm near Sunrise City in 1860. Mr. Dean represented his district\r\nin the house of the twenty-first and twenty-second legislatures.\r\n\r\n\r\nTAYLOR'S FALLS.\r\n\r\nThe village of Taylor's Falls was platted in 1851, a survey of lots\r\nhaving been made at that time by Theodore S. Parker, of Stillwater.\r\nAdditions were made from time to time as the increasing population\r\ndemanded. A year before the survey a frame building was erected on\r\nwhat was subsequently the northwest corner of River and First streets.\r\nIn 1851 and 1852 some streets were opened, but with considerable\r\ndifficulty, on account of the trap rock, which to be removed required\r\nblasting. Bowlders that could not be removed were buried. The work of\r\ncutting a street to the upper steamboat landing was specially\r\ndifficult. There were no roads to the village, and the only means of\r\ntravel was by steamboat, bateaux, or birch bark canoes, until the\r\ngovernment road was opened sometime in 1856. A post office was\r\nestablished in March, 1851, and a weekly mail was ordered from\r\nStillwater. Prior to this time a semi-monthly mail had been carried\r\nbetween the points named. Of the office established in 1851, N. C. D.\r\nTaylor was first postmaster. The office was in W. H. C. Folsom's\r\nstore, Folsom acting as deputy postmaster. The successors of Mr.\r\nTaylor have been, Porter E. Walker, Edward P. Wyman, Thomas Holmes,\r\nOscar Roos, George W. Seymour, and N. M. Humphrey; not a long list for\r\nthirty-five years. The location of the office was changed with each\r\nsuccessive incumbent. The mail carrier in 1851 was the Hon. Warren\r\nBristol, since then four times a representative and senator from\r\nGoodhue county in the state legislature, and United States judge in\r\nArizona. The mail service has passed through all the gradations from a\r\nsemi-monthly to a semi-daily mail. The mail has been carried in canoes\r\nor bateaux, on foot, on horseback, on steamboat and rail car. It is\r\nnow carried by rail. Of the Baker & Taylor mill an account has been\r\ngiven elsewhere. The next mill, a grist mill, was built by N. C. D.\r\nTaylor, W. H. C. Folsom and the Day brothers, in 1852. It was several\r\nyears later remodeled and changed into a carding mill, and is now the\r\nproperty of Jonas Gray. Kingman Brothers built a saw mill in 1857,\r\nwith a capacity of 12,000 feet per day. Several parties succeeded to\r\nthe ownership and control of the mill, but, after doing good service\r\nfor many years, it was abandoned. Clark Brothers built a lumber and\r\nstave mill in 1868. After ten years this mill was removed.\r\n\r\nThe first merchant was Daniel Mears, who sold goods as early as 1848.\r\nW. H. C. Folsom opened a store in 1850; Taylor & Fox in 1852. The\r\nChisago House was built by Thomson & Smith in 1852, on the corner of\r\nBench and First streets. In 1870 the name was changed to Dalles House.\r\nIt has changed landlords many times, the last being Henry Kattenberg.\r\nThe Cascade House was built in 1853, on the corner of Walnut and Bench\r\nstreets, by Richard Arnold. It is no longer used. The Falls House was\r\nbuilt in 1870, on Bench street near Walnut, by Erastus Guard, and\r\nconverted into a hotel in 1880, with Henry Kattenberg as proprietor,\r\nby whom it was conducted as a temperance house. It is now in charge of\r\nEugene Fitzgerald.\r\n\r\nThe first physician was Lucius B. Smith. Susan Thomson taught the\r\nfirst school. The first marriage was that of Charles D. Turney and\r\nCecilia Ring, Ansel Smith, justice of the peace, tying the knot. Wm.\r\nColby was the first white child born in the village. The first death\r\nwas that of a three-year-old daughter of Ansel Smith, in 1852. Rev. W.\r\nT. Boutwell preached the first sermon, in 1851. In 1852 three young\r\nEpiscopal ministers, Revs. Breck, Myrick and Wilcoxson, alternated in\r\nholding services, but did not organize a society. Rev. Julius S.\r\nWebber, Baptist, preached occasionally in 1852 and 1853; Rev. W.\r\nMiner, Congregationalist, in 1856 and 1857 became the first resident\r\nminister. In April, 1859, Rev. Silas Bolles, a Methodist, organized a\r\nsociety, the first in the village. In June, 1859, Rev. A. M. Torbet\r\norganized a Baptist society and served as pastor four years. The\r\nsociety built a church in 1861 at a cost of $3,000.\r\n\r\nIn 1860 the Swedish Evangelical Lutherans built a church on the corner\r\nof Mulberry and Government streets, at a cost of $1,500. Rev. C. A.\r\nCedarstam was pastor in 1871-72-73, Rev. ---- Tornell the three\r\nsucceeding years, and three other pastors have served since. In 1866\r\nRev. John G. Hall organized a Presbyterian society, and built a church\r\nin 1868, on the corner of River and Chisago streets, at a cost of\r\n$1,500. Mr. Hall served as pastor four years. The Roman Catholics\r\nerected a church on the corner of Walnut and Centre streets in 1873,\r\nat a cost of $1,000. They have as yet no settled priest or parish\r\nschool.\r\n\r\nThe St. Croix Bridge Company was organized in 1854. The incorporators\r\nwere W. H. C. Folsom, Patrick Fox, Joshua L. Taylor, W. S. Hungerford,\r\nWm. Kent, Nelson McCarty, John Dobney, W. F. Colby, Orange Walker,\r\nFred W. Lammers, and N. C. D. Taylor. The bridge was built in 1856; W.\r\nS. Sewall, St. Paul, was the engineer. The capital stock amounted to\r\n$4,925, and was divided into 197 shares at $25 each. The bridge was\r\nrebuilt in 1870, on the same plan, and in 1884 was replaced by an iron\r\nbridge, at a cost of $6,253. The bridge has a span of 150 feet and is\r\na light and graceful structure. It was the first bridge that spanned\r\nthe St. Croix and Mississippi rivers.\r\n\r\nThe Chisago County Bank was organized in 1858, under the state banking\r\nlaw; capital stock, $25,000; Levi W. Folsom, president; S. C. Gould,\r\ncashier. It was closed in 1859.\r\n\r\nThe Taylor's Falls Copper Mining Company was organized Dec. 15, 1874;\r\nW. H. C. Folsom, president; George W.

Whiting, president; J. A. McGowan, secretary.\r\nWithin two years the library numbered 1,000 volumes and since that\r\ntime the number has been increased to 1,500.\r\n\r\nIn 1858 the village of Taylor's Falls was regularly incorporated with\r\nthe following board of officers: Trustees, Patrick Fox, president; W.\r\nH. C. Folsom, E. D. Whiting, L. W. Folsom; recorder, H. H. Newbury;\r\ntreasurer, Wm. Comer.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN INDIAN DANCE.\r\n\r\nThe last Indian dance in Taylor's Falls was given by a party of\r\nChippewas in 1856. They had come down the St. Croix in birch canoes\r\nwith furs and cranberries to exchange with Samuels in St. Croix\r\nvillage for \"scootawabo,\" or whisky. They remained about a week,\r\ndrinking and carousing in their peculiar style. One Sabbath, and when,\r\nfor a wonder, they were quite sober, they visited Taylor's Falls and\r\ngave a series of grotesque and laughable dances in the street,\r\nopposite Folsom's store, after which they called for presents as\r\ntokens of friendship and appreciation, kindly and gravely shook hands\r\nand recrossed the river.\r\n\r\n    \"Thus departed Hiawatha.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIOGRAPHICAL.\r\n\r\nJESSE TAYLOR, the first permanent settler of Taylor's Falls, came to\r\nthe Falls in 1838, as narrated in the general history of the village.\r\nNothing is known of his life before coming to the Falls, except that\r\nhe was originally from Kentucky, and lived at Fort Snelling, where he\r\nwas employed as a stonemason. By the death of his associate, B. F.\r\nBaker, he came into possession of the mill property and its\r\nbelongings. This he sold to Joshua L.

He remained\r\nwith the regiment, however, until, disabled by his wound and by\r\nsickness at the siege of Spanish Fort, he was compelled to return\r\nhome. He never recovered his health, but in 1867 peacefully passed\r\naway. He was a good man, a brave soldier, and an exemplary Christian.\r\n\r\nHENRY N.

At the age of seventeen he\r\ncommenced learning the printer's trade, served as an apprentice four\r\nyears, and graduated on his twenty-first birthday. Having some means\r\ninherited from his father, he commenced a newspaper enterprise at\r\nCincinnati, invested and lost all his money. For several years he was\r\nengaged as a reporter and assistant editor on various papers in\r\nCincinnati, Louisville, Vicksburg and New Orleans. In 1849 he formed a\r\nbusiness partnership with Nat. McLean, of Cincinnati, to establish a\r\npaper at St. Paul. He arrived at St. Paul May 27th of that year. The\r\nfirst number of the _Minnesota Register_ was printed in Cincinnati and\r\nbrought to St. Paul for distribution in July. In October the paper was\r\nunited with the _Minnesota Chronicle_, and so published until July,\r\n1850, when it was discontinued. In 1851 Mr. Owens and G. W. Moore\r\nstarted the _Weekly Minnesotian_, adding in 1854 a daily and\r\ntri-weekly edition. The _Minnesotian_ was ably edited, and was\r\nRepublican in politics. Owing to poor health, Mr. Owens sold his\r\ninterest in the _Minnesotian_. In 1862 he was appointed quartermaster\r\nof the Ninth Minnesota Volunteer Infantry. This regiment did service\r\nin the State during the Sioux War, but in 1864 was ordered South and\r\nattached to the Sixteenth Army Corps. Mr. Owens served as regimental\r\nand brigade quartermaster until the close of the war. In April, 1868,\r\nhe was appointed register of the United States land office, which\r\nposition he held until his death, Sept. 11, 1884. He was first Grand\r\nMaster of the I. O. O.

She left an only daughter, Mary Helen. Mr. Owens' second\r\nwife was Frances M. Hobbs, whom he married Oct. 26, 1853, in New York\r\nCity.\r\n\r\nANDREW CLENDENNING was born in 1798, in the north of Ireland. He was a\r\nProtestant, united with the Methodist church when a young man and\r\nproved ever after a consistent Christian, strong in his religious\r\nconvictions and a faithful worker. He crossed the ocean in 1835,\r\nlocating first at New Brunswick. In 1855 he came to Michigan, in 1859\r\nto St. Croix Falls, in 1870 to Taylor's Falls, where he resided until\r\nhis death, in 1875. He left three sons in Taylor's Falls, Andrew,\r\nJames and George, and one son in Oregon. One son, Joseph, died in the\r\nservice of his adopted country, having enlisted in Company C, Seventh\r\nMinnesota. One daughter, the wife of Thomas Thompson, of St. Croix\r\nFalls, died in 1886.\r\n\r\nSMITH ELLISON was born in Marine, Madison county, Illinois, March 15,\r\n1823. He came to Marine Mills in 1844. For two years he was in the\r\nemploy of Judd, Walker & Co. The next three years he spent at Osceola,\r\nWisconsin. In 1849 he engaged in logging and continued in that\r\nbusiness for many years. In 1856 he settled on and improved a farm in\r\nSunrise. In 1868 he removed to Taylor's Falls and formed a partnership\r\nwith L. K. Stannard in the mercantile and lumbering business. Mr.\r\nEllison was a representative in the eighth legislature, and served as\r\ncounty commissioner eight years. In late years he has been interested\r\nin a saw, planing and flour mill at Stillwater. He is a stockholder\r\nand director in the First National Bank at Stillwater and owns large\r\ntracts of pine lands. He has applied himself closely to business, is\r\nenergetic, cautious and thoroughly reliable. Mr. Ellison is unmarried.\r\n\r\n\r\nWYOMING\r\n\r\nIncludes township 33, range 21. The eastern half is well timbered, the\r\nwest has oak openings. Sunrise river flows in a northerly direction\r\nthrough the township, and with its tributaries and numerous lakes\r\nsupplies it abundantly with water. There are some wild meadows and\r\ntamarack swamps. Green lake, in the eastern part of the township, is a\r\npicturesque sheet of water, five miles in length by one and a half\r\nbroad, with sloping timbered shores and cedar points projecting into\r\nthe lake, in one place forming a natural roadway nearly across, which\r\nis connected with the mainland opposite by a bridge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SMITH ELLISON.]\r\n\r\nA colony from Eastern Pennsylvania settled the western part of the\r\ntownship in 1855. The colony was composed of L. O. Tombler, Dr. John\r\nW. Comfort, E. K. Benton, and some others, in all ten families. The\r\neastern part had been previously settled by Swedes. The township was\r\norganized in 1858. The supervisors were J. W. Comfort, L. O. Tombler\r\nand Fred Tepel. A post office was established at Wyoming with J. Engle\r\nas postmaster. The Catholics and Methodists erected churches in 1864.\r\nThe St. Paul & Duluth railroad was completed in 1868, and in 1879 the\r\nbranch road to Taylor's Falls. The township was settled rapidly after\r\nthe completion of the railroad. At the junction of the two roads there\r\nis a good depot, two stores and a fine hotel, the latter kept by L. O.\r\nTombler.\r\n\r\n\r\nWYOMING VILLAGE\r\n\r\nWas surveyed and platted by Ben. W. Brunson in 1869, in portions of\r\nsections 17, 19 and 20, township 33, range 21; proprietors, Western\r\nLand Association, L. Mendenhall, agent.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEER GARDEN VILLAGE\r\n\r\nWas surveyed and platted by Alex. Cairns, October, 1856, in sections 1\r\nand 12, township 33, range 21; proprietor, Erastus S. Edgerton.\r\n\r\nLUCIUS O. TOMBLER was born in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, in 1823. His\r\nancestors were Moravians, who, driven from Germany in the eighteenth\r\ncentury, came to America, and founded the colony of Bethlehem, a\r\ncolony famed for its thrift, advancement in educational matters, and\r\nhigh morality. Mr. Tombler and his wife, Christiana Brown, to whom he\r\nwas married in 1845, were educated in the Moravian schools. They came\r\nwith the colony from Bethlehem to Wyoming in 1855, and built a two\r\nstory log hotel on the St. Paul and Lake Superior stage road, which\r\nwas long noted as a rest for the weary traveler and a home for the\r\ninvalid. Mr. Tombler was an energetic, worthy man, genial in his\r\nmanners, a good farmer, a good landlord, and an accomplished musician\r\nbesides. Mrs. Tombler possessed superior endowments as a landlady, and\r\nthe house soon gained widespread popularity with the traveling public.\r\nThe first hotel was burned in 1876, but the year following a more\r\ncommodious building was erected on the grounds, which, with its modern\r\nimprovements within, and its park-like surroundings, is more popular\r\nwith the traveling public than its predecessor. The Tombler family\r\nconsists of Charles A., the father of Lucius O., born in 1800, but\r\nstill hale and vigorous, in the possession of all his faculties, two\r\nsons, Maurice and Milton, and one daughter, Laura. Charles A., the\r\ngrandfather, has received the thirty-third degree Scottish Masonic\r\nrite.\r\n\r\nDR. JOHN WOOLMAN COMFORT was born in Bucks county, Pennsylvania, in\r\n1804. He graduated at Jefferson Medical College, Philadelphia, in\r\n1836, and practiced medicine continuously, and, although an\r\naccomplished graduate of an allopathic school, was a zealous advocate\r\nand exponent of the Thompsonian system, in favor of which he published\r\nseveral works. He was also for some years editor of the _Thompsonian\r\nMedical Journal_. As a physician he was untiring, and impartial in the\r\nperformance of his duties, never refusing a medical call on account of\r\nthe poverty of the patient. He was especially kind to the poor. He\r\ncame to Wyoming with the colony in 1855, and died there Feb. 9, 1881,\r\nleaving a widow, since deceased, one son in Philadelphia, and two\r\ndaughters, Mrs. Markley, of Wyoming, and Mrs. Carter, of Melbourne,\r\nAustralia.\r\n\r\nISAAC MARKLEY was born in Montgomery county, Pennsylvania, April 2,\r\n1822.

At the first session of\r\nthe territorial legislature Washington county was established in full\r\nfor county and judicial purposes. It included all that part of the\r\nTerritory lying east of the range line between ranges 21 and 22 and\r\nnorth of the Mississippi as far as the British possessions and\r\nfractional parts of townships 29 and 30, range 22.\r\n\r\nThe courts held prior to this organization are referred to elsewhere.\r\nThe first territorial court in Washington county was held Aug. 13,\r\n1849, Judge Aaron Goodrich, presiding; Judge David Cooper, associate.\r\nIt continued in session six days. There were sixty cases on the\r\ncalendar. Harvey Wilson was clerk of court; A. M. Mitchell, of St.\r\nPaul, United States marshal; Henry L. Moss, district attorney; John\r\nMorgan, sheriff. The lawyers present were H. L. Moss; M. S. Wilkinson,\r\nM. E. Ames, A. M. Mitchell, L. Babcock, and David Lambert. The second\r\ncourt house (the first under the new organization) was built in\r\nStillwater, corner of Fourth and Chestnut streets, in 1849, at a cost\r\nof $3,600. This was the first court house in the territory of\r\nMinnesota. The lot was donated by John McKusick. In this building were\r\nheld all the courts from 1849 to 1867. In that year Churchill & Nelson\r\ndonated a city block on Nelson Hill, a fine location overlooking the\r\ncity and lake, and the county erected upon it a fine stone structure\r\ncosting $60,000, including jail and ground improvements.\r\n\r\nThe first election was held Nov. 26, 1849. The following board of\r\ncounty officers was elected: Commissioners, John McKusick, Hiram\r\nBerkey, Joseph Haskell; treasurer, Socrates Nelson; register of deeds,\r\nJohn S. Proctor; judge of probate, Harvey Wilson; sheriff, Jesse\r\nTaylor. At the same election the following persons were elected\r\njustices of the peace in their various precincts: St. Croix Falls,\r\nJerry Ross; Point Douglas, Martin Leavitt; Stillwater, Albert Harris\r\nand H. K. McKinstry; Marine, James Moore and W. H. Johnson.\r\n\r\nThe territory of the county has been from time to time divided and\r\nsubdivided for the organization of new counties. Washington county,\r\nhowever, was divided but once. In 1852 the county of Chisago was set\r\noff in the north, since which time its boundaries have been, Chisago\r\non the north, the St. Croix river and lake on the east, the\r\nMississippi river on the south, Anoka and Ramsey counties and the\r\nMississippi river on the west. It includes the following townships:\r\nFrom 27 to 32 inclusive, ranges 20 and 21, and fractional parts of\r\ntownships 31 and 32, range 19, and fractional part of township 26,\r\nrange 20.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTON\r\n\r\nWas organized as a town in 1858. Joseph Haskell, G. W. Cutler and H.\r\nL. Thomas were the first supervisors; Minor H. Thomas, clerk. It\r\nincludes a fractional part of township 28, range 20. It is well\r\nwatered by Bolles and Valley creeks, streams tributary to the St.\r\nCroix. The southwestern part of the township is rolling prairie, the\r\nremainder somewhat broken. The soil is all productive and the streams\r\nafford good water powers. The township had French settlers as early as\r\n1837,--Baptist Fornier and others. Joseph Haskell commenced his farm\r\nin 1839. Prior to 1850 A. Mackey, L. Bolles, P. J. Carli, T. F.\r\nRandolph, E. Bissell, N. H. Johnson, James Getchell, and A. McHattie\r\nlocated in the town.\r\n\r\nThe first crops were raised by the French settlers. The first marriage\r\nwas that of Andrew Mackey to Mrs. Hamilton, in 1844. The first child\r\nborn was Helen M. Haskell, daughter of Joseph Haskell. The first death\r\nwas that of Paul J. Carli, in 1844, accidentally drowned in the lake.\r\nThe first road was located between Stillwater and Point Douglas, in\r\n1847. A military road was surveyed from Point Douglas to Superior\r\nthrough this town in 1850. Lemuel Bolles erected a flouring mill on\r\nBolles creek, in the winter of 1845-46, the first to grind wheat\r\nnorth of Prairie du Chien. The old mill was long since replaced by a\r\nnew one, and the mill property has changed owners many times, Emil\r\nMunch being the last owner. The present mill is a fine structure with\r\na capacity of fifty barrels per day. The first post office was at the\r\nold mill; L. Bolles, postmaster. The first organized school was in the\r\nHaskell district, in 1855. The Scandinavian Methodists have a church\r\nin section 18, built in 1885. The German Lutherans have a church in\r\nsection 6, and a parochial school.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTON VILLAGE.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1855, Afton village was surveyed and platted by Haskell,\r\nGetchell & Thomas, in section 23; Emerson & Case were the surveyors.\r\nThe village is beautifully located on the shore of the lake and\r\ncontains one hotel, one church (Congregational), one school house, an\r\nacademy building, and several stores, shops and dwellings. The\r\nacademy, known as the St. Croix Academy, was established in 1868, and\r\nthe building, a handsome three story brick structure, erected the same\r\nyear. Mr. Gorrie was the first principal. Simon Putnam was the first\r\npastor of the Congregational church.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUTH AFTON\r\n\r\nIs located one mile south of Afton, on the shores of the lake. It has\r\nan elevator, store, warehouses and other buildings. A saw mill was\r\nbuilt by Lowry & Co., between Afton and South Afton; in 1854, and\r\nrebuilt in 1855 by Thomas & Sons. The Getchell Brothers built a mill\r\nin 1861, which was burned.\r\n\r\n\r\nVALLEY CREEK\r\n\r\nIs a small village on Bolles creek, in sections 9 and 10. Erastus\r\nBolles located here in 1857, and improved the water power, built a\r\nmachine shop and manufactured edge tools. He sold out to his son, C.\r\nE. Bolles, who further improved the property by building a corn and\r\nfeed mill. In 1860 Gilbert & Buswell erected a flour mill with three\r\nrun of stone. The post office in this village was established in 1874,\r\nwith Erastus Bolles as postmaster.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. MARY VILLAGE\r\n\r\nWas platted in 1855, on lots 1, 2 and 3, section 14. Thomas W.\r\nColeman, proprietor; James A. Carr, surveyor.\r\n\r\nJOSEPH HASKELL was born Jan. 9, 1805, in Kennebec county, Maine.\r\nDuring his minority he worked with his father on a farm at Skowhegan,\r\nMaine. In 1837 he came West, stopping two years in Indiana. July 24,\r\n1839, he arrived at Fort Snelling on the steamer Ariel, obtained\r\nemployment of Frank Steele for whom he, with others, rowed a mackinaw\r\nboat from Fort Snelling to St. Croix Falls. While at the falls he\r\nworked on the dam and mill, then in process of building. In the fall\r\nof 1839 he made a trip to Fort Snelling and returned to the Falls,\r\ncarrying the mail in a birch canoe to Catfish bar, and then across by\r\nIndian trail to the Fort. While on this trip he made the claim for his\r\nhomestead in Afton. In 1840 he put three acres under cultivation,\r\nraising corn and potatoes. This was the first attempt at farming,\r\nexcept by the French pioneers, who raised only garden crops, north of\r\nPrairie du Chien. September, 1844, he made a trip to Maine, and\r\nreturned bringing three sisters with him. They kept house for him\r\nuntil he married. Mr. Haskell was married to Olive Furber, sister of\r\nJ. W. Furber, in 1849. They have four children, Helen M., Mary E.,\r\nHenry Pitt and Hiram A. Mr. Haskell was a representative in the state\r\nlegislatures of 1869 and 1871. He was of most exemplary habits. He\r\ndied at his home Jan. 23, 1885.\r\n\r\nLEMUEL BOLLES was born in New York. He came to St. Croix Falls in\r\n1840. In 1843 he opened a grindstone quarry in the soft, coarse\r\nsandstones, a short distance below the Dalles. In 1844-45 his\r\ngrindstones were much used. He made Stillwater his home in 1844-55,\r\nwhen he removed to Afton. He was industrious, ingenious and eccentric.\r\nHe died in Stillwater in 1875.\r\n\r\nTAYLOR F. RANDOLPH was the first school teacher in Washington county.\r\nHe and his wife taught at Red Rock in 1837-38-39-40, under the\r\nsupervision of the Methodist mission at that place. In 1842 he settled\r\non a farm in a valley near Bissell's Mounds, Afton, where he and his\r\nwife died in 1846.\r\n\r\nELIJAH BISSELL, in 1842, located a farm near the three mounds in\r\nsection 8, which now bear his name. He left the county in 1850.\r\n\r\nANDREW MACKEY.--Mr. Mackey, of whom some mention is made in the\r\nchapter concerning the early history, is one of the first pioneers,\r\nhaving come in 1837 with John Boyce to the valley of the St. Croix in\r\na mackinaw boat, towed from St. Louis to the mouth of Lake St. Croix\r\nby a steamer, from which point they poled their boat up to the St.\r\nCroix falls, where they landed on the west side. From this point they\r\nmade a portage and cordelled their boat, and with poles and lines\r\nascended to Snake river. He engaged for some time in lumbering, and\r\nworked at the falls until 1841, when he settled on a beautiful farm,\r\non a part of which Afton is now situated. Mr. Mackey was born in\r\nKilkenny, Ireland, in 1804, and (in 1888) is still living. His wife\r\ndied in 1873.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAYTOWN\r\n\r\nComprises the north half of fractional township 28, range 20. The\r\nsurface is somewhat uneven and broken, owing to the lake bluff\r\nformation, but there is much good farming land. Originally it was\r\ncovered with oaks or oak openings. It derives its name from a bay\r\nindenting the western shore of Lake St. Croix. At South Stillwater\r\nvillage a considerable stream, known as Spring creek, flows from some\r\nlarge springs and forms a good water power in its descent to the lake.\r\nTwo flour mills are located on this stream. In 1842 Francis Bruce\r\nbuilt a house on the present site of the office of the St. Croix\r\nLumber Company. In the same year Norman Kittson built a trading post\r\nat what has been since known as Kittson's Point. Both of these parties\r\nleft in 1844 and John Allen built a house and cultivated a field on\r\nthe east side of Kittson's Point. Allen sold the place in 1846 and\r\nremoved to California. He raised the first crops in the town. In 1847\r\nJoseph Pero became a prominent settler and made him a good home on\r\nSpring creek. Other parties made claims and abandoned or sold them.\r\nFiske & Marty located here in 1848. In 1860 came Ambrose Secrest and\r\nsome others. In 1852 Nelson, Loomis & Co. built a steam saw mill on\r\nthe bay. In 1854 Secrest & Booth built a flour mill on Spring creek.\r\nIn 1858 Baytown was organized as a town. The first supervisors were\r\nAmbrose Secrest, John Parker and W. H. Crosby; John J. Hale, clerk.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAYTOWN VILLAGE.\r\n\r\nSocrates Nelson, D. B. Loomis, Levi Churchill, Daniel Mears, and James\r\nW. Hinton, in February, 1856, platted the village of Baytown. Harvey\r\nWilson was the surveyor. The location was on the lake shore, lots 3\r\nand 4, section 11, and lot 7, section 2. In 1872 a post office was\r\nestablished called South Stillwater; William Graves, postmaster.\r\n\r\n\r\nBANGOR VILLAGE\r\n\r\nWas platted May. 1857, by C. I. and J. E. Whitney, Albert and Edwin\r\nCaldwell, Wm. Hollinshead, Isaac Staples, and A. J. Short; J. J.\r\nCarleton, surveyor. It was situated on the shore of the lake south of\r\nBaytown.\r\n\r\n\r\nMIDDLETOWN VILLAGE\r\n\r\nWas platted in July, 1857, in parts of sections 2 and 3, by William\r\nHolcomb; Myron B.

S.\r\nSewall, surveyor. South Stillwater was made to include the platted\r\nvillages of Baytown, Bangor and Middletown. It has prospered greatly\r\nas a manufacturing village. In 1854 Torinus, Staples & Co. built a\r\nsteam saw mill, to which from time to time they added various\r\nmanufacturing establishments. Subsequently the firm became the St.\r\nCroix Lumber Company. In the spring of 1876 this company sustained a\r\nloss by fire on their mill and appurtenances to the value of $70,000,\r\nwhich was not insured: With indomitable energy they rebuilt, and\r\nprospered. The two leading business men in this firm were Louis\r\nTorinus and William Chalmers. Turnbull's steam saw mill, on the lake\r\nshore, has a capacity of 100,000 feet per day. The property is valued\r\nat $70,000. The South Stillwater Lumber Company has a mill with a\r\ncapacity of 90,000 feet per day, with planer and other machinery\r\nattached, in which they have invested $70,000. The firm consists of D.\r\nTozer, A. T. Jenks, H. McGlinn, E. W. Durant, and R. Wheeler. The\r\nmills of the Herschey Lumber Company, valued at $70,000, have a\r\ncapacity of 100,000 feet per day. The proprietor, ---- Herschey, lives\r\nin Muscatine, Iowa.\r\n\r\nThe Stillwater Dock Company was organized in 1877. The company\r\nconsists of Durant, Wheeler & Co., St. Croix Lumber Company and Jonah\r\nBachelder. They have built many fine steamers and barges. Their\r\nrepairing docks are a great convenience to steamboat lumbermen. The\r\nSouth Stillwater Soap Factory, owned by McKenzie & Co., deserves\r\nhonorable mention. The construction of the branch railroad from\r\nStillwater in 1872, and the St. Paul & Milwaukee railroad, built in\r\n1883, have greatly increased the prosperity of the village. Aside from\r\nmills and manufactories there are many private residences, one hotel,\r\nstores, shops, a Lutheran church, and a school house. There are three\r\ncemeteries in the village limits known as Hazlewood, St. Michael's,\r\nand the potter's field. The block for the former was contributed by\r\nSecrest & Pero, in 1858. St. Michael's was established by the\r\nCatholics in 1873. The potter's field was established by the city of\r\nStillwater in 1873. The first death in the limits of South Stillwater\r\nwas that of Sylvester, son of Joseph Pero. South Stillwater was\r\norganized in 1881. First board of officers were: President, B. E.\r\nMeigs; clerk, Edward Ivison; councilmen, Richard Burns, C. M.\r\nAnderson, Charles Kregor; justice of the peace, Ambrose Secrest.

Ferguson, Lewis Hill, James S. Davis, Jonathan Brown,\r\nand Jacob Moshier were the first settlers, locating here in 1844. The\r\nfirst marriage was that of Henry W. Crosby to Hannah Waterman, in\r\n1854. The first child born was Nathan, son of John Atkinson, in 1846;\r\nthe first death was that of Mehitable, wife of P. P. Furber, in 1851.\r\nA post office was established at Cottage Grove village in 1850; J. W.\r\nFurber was postmaster.

The early history of the town is\r\nsubstantially that of its earliest settlement, Point Douglas. It was\r\norganized in 1858. Supervisors, John Shearer, Thomas Wright and David\r\nHone.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINT DOUGLAS.\r\n\r\nLevi Hertzell and Oscar Burris, young men, located in 1839 on the\r\nextreme point of the delta between the Mississippi and St. Croix lake,\r\nwhere they cut wood and sold it to the steamboats. They built a log\r\ncabin and store, under one roof, and traded with Indians, discharged\r\nsoldiers and French settlers. They were diligent and industrious, and\r\nprospered. In 1846 they built a frame store building. Their trade\r\nincreased and they grew wealthy. Messrs.

The surface is somewhat\r\nrolling, and before settlement was timbered chiefly with hardwood. It\r\nis dotted with beautiful lakes, some of which have abrupt and hilly\r\nshores. The more noted of these lakes are Big, Carnelian, Square,\r\nBony, Terrapin, Long, Fish, and Hay.\r\n\r\nNext to St. Croix Falls, Marine contains the earliest settlement in\r\nthe valley. In September, 1838, Lewis Judd and David Hone were\r\ndeputized by a company of men residing in Marine, Illinois, to visit\r\nthe Northwest and examine the region recently secured by treaty from\r\nthe Chippewas, and to return the same year and report upon its\r\nadvantages of climate, soil and other resources. They were authorized\r\nalso to locate a claim for a future settlement, if they found one\r\nentirely suitable. They embarked on the steamer Ariel at St. Louis,\r\nSeptember 10th, and were twenty-five days reaching the head of Lake\r\nSt. Croix, whence they proceeded in a flatboat propelled by poles up\r\nthe St. Croix as far as the falls, and thence to the mouth of Kettle\r\nriver. Returning by birch canoes, they stopped at the site of the\r\npresent village of Marine, and there made a mill claim. They then\r\nreturned to Marine, Illinois, where they arrived November 10th, and\r\nreported favorably on the location chosen.\r\n\r\nDuring the following winter a verbal agreement was made by thirteen\r\npersons, all of Marine settlement, to start in the spring and build a\r\nsaw mill on the distant St. Croix. On April 27th this company left St.\r\nLouis on the steamer Fayette for the new settlement, which they\r\nreached on the thirteenth of May. The Fayette was chartered expressly\r\nfor this voyage. They took with them mill irons, farming tools,\r\nhousehold goods, three yoke of oxen, and cows.\r\n\r\nThe members of the party were Lewis, George and Albert Judd, David\r\nHone, Orange Walker, Asa S. and Madison Parker, Samuel Burkelo, Wm. B.\r\nDibble, Dr. Lucius Green, Joseph Cottrell, and Hiram Berkey. When they\r\nlanded they found Jeremiah Russell and Levi W. Stratton in possession\r\nof the claim, they having taken possession during the preceding\r\nwinter. These men demanded and received three hundred dollars for\r\nrelinquishing the claim to its rightful owners.\r\n\r\nThe colonists set to work immediately to build a log cabin as a\r\ntemporary shelter, which being completed, they commenced the mill, and\r\nworked with such energy that it was finished in ninety days. The first\r\nwheel used was a flutter wheel, which, not proving satisfactory, was\r\nreplaced by an overshot with buckets. This mill sawed the first lumber\r\nin the St. Croix valley.\r\n\r\nOrange Walker was the first clerk and chieftain of the concern, and\r\nwhen anything was wanted a call of the company would be made, and the\r\nmembers assembled. No article of agreement existed. Only one book was\r\nkept for a series of years--a unique affair, no doubt. The first\r\ninstallment was $200; second, $75; third, $50; all within two years,\r\nafter which the company became self sustaining. No partner forfeited\r\nhis stock. One by one the partners sold out their interest, until\r\nOrange Walker and G. B. Judd were the owners. The company was first\r\nknown as the Marine Lumber Company. In 1850 the name was changed to\r\nJudd, Walker & Co., the firm consisting then of the Judd brothers,\r\nOrange Walker, Samuel Burkelo, Asa Parker, and H. Berkey. In 1863,\r\nwhen Orange Walker was sole owner, he associated with him Samuel Judd\r\nand W. H. Veazie, and the firm name has since been Walker, Judd &\r\nVeazie.\r\n\r\nThe colonists raised, during the first year, corn, potatoes and garden\r\nvegetables. They found the Indians peaceably inclined toward the\r\nsettlers, though the Chippewas and Sioux kept up a constant warfare\r\nwith each other. During the winter of 1839-40 four members of the\r\ncompany, Parker, Berkey, Green and Dibble, were sent to the mouth of\r\nKettle river to cut logs. Marine was organized as a town in 1858, with\r\nthe following supervisors: J. R. M. Gaskell; John E. Mower and B. F.\r\nAllen.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARINE MILLS VILLAGE.\r\n\r\nThe settlement gradually grew into the village of Marine Mills, which\r\nwas not platted, however, until 1853, nor incorporated until 1875. The\r\nfollowing was the first board of officers: President, Orange Walker;\r\ncouncilmen, J. R. M. Gaskell, Ola Westergreen and Asa S. Parker. Until\r\n1842 the mail was received from Ft. Snelling by private conveyance,\r\nwhen a monthly mail service was established from Point Douglas, and\r\nSamuel Burkelo was appointed postmaster.\r\n\r\nThe first jury trial in the St. Croix valley was held at Marine, in\r\n1840, before Joseph R. Brown, justice of the peace. The case was that\r\nof Philander Prescott against Chas. D. Foote, plaintiff charging\r\ndefendant with jumping a claim. The jury consisted of Samuel Burkelo,\r\nOrange Walker, H. Berkey, David Hone. J. Haskell, J. S. Norris, A.\r\nMcHattie, A. Mackey, H. Sweezy, Francis Nason, and two others. The\r\nclaim in dispute was located near Prescott. The court adjourned to\r\nallow the jury to visit Prescott to ascertain if the claim had been\r\nmade in accordance with custom. On viewing the premises the jury\r\nfailed to agree, and the matter was compromised by Prescott allowing\r\nFoote eighty acres of the claim.\r\n\r\nThe first white child born in Marine was Sarah Anna Waterman, in 1844.\r\nDr. Wright, the first physician, located in Marine in 1849. The first\r\nmarriage was that of Wm. B. Dibble to Eliza McCauslin, in 1842. The\r\nfirst death was that of a child of W. H. Nobles, in 1843. The first\r\nsermon preached was by Rev. J. Hurlburt, a Methodist missionary, Jan.\r\n1, 1844. The first school was taught by Sarah Judd, in 1849. The\r\nSwedish Evangelical Lutherans built the first church in the town of\r\nMarine, in section 27, in 1856, a log structure afterward used as a\r\nschool, its place being supplied by a new structure in section 14 in\r\n1858. In 1874 a large church 50 × 80 feet, ground plan, and with\r\nsteeple 80 feet high, succeeded the second structure. A fine parsonage\r\nwas attached. This church was blown down by a cyclone in 1884, but was\r\nrebuilt.\r\n\r\nThe Swedish Methodists built a church on the south side of Long lake\r\nin 1856; C. P. Agrelius, pastor. The Congregationalists commenced the\r\nfirst church and perfected the first organization in Marine village,\r\nin 1857. The church was completed and dedicated in 1859. Rev Geo.\r\nSpaulding was the first pastor. The second Congregational church was\r\nerected in 1878, in section 21. The Swedish Lutherans have a church\r\nand congregation in the village of Marine. The church was built in\r\n1875. Rev. L. O. Lindh was the first pastor. Oakland Cemetery\r\nAssociation was organized in 1872 and the cemetery located near Marine\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVEMENTS.\r\n\r\nA passable road was opened from Stillwater to Marine in 1841. The\r\ngovernment road from Point Douglas to Superior was built through\r\nMarine in 1852-3. The company built the first frame dwelling, on a\r\npoint above the mill, in 1848. The mill company built a frame store in\r\nthe same year. This building was burned in 1863; loss, $4,000. The\r\nonly hotel until 1850 was a log building, when the Marine store was\r\nbuilt. The Lightner House was built in 1857, the St. Croix House in\r\n1858. The Marine flour mill was built in 1856 by Gaskell & Co. The\r\nfirst flour was manufactured in 1857. The mill is four stories high\r\nand is furnished with a turbine wheel. The water is brought a distance\r\nof 1,000 feet by an elevated race. The Arcola saw mills were built in\r\nthe winter of 1846-7, by Martin Mower, David B. Loomis, Joseph\r\nBrewster and W. H. C. Folsom. They were located on the river shore\r\nthree miles below Marine Mills. The motive power is an overshot wheel,\r\npropelled by water from two large springs. The mill is now the\r\nproperty of Martin Mower. The losses by fire in Marine have been:\r\n\r\n     The Marine saw mill, Sept. 16, 1863, loss $6,000; Judd &\r\n     Gaskell's store, Jan. 9, 1864, loss $4,000; Samuel B. Judd's\r\n     dwelling, April, 1884, loss $12,000;\r\n\r\n     W. H. Veazie's dwelling, April, 1885, loss $6,000.\r\n\r\nA heavy financial failure occurred in the winter of 1885-6. The firm\r\nof Walker, Judd & Veazio were compelled to make an assignment;\r\nindebtedness, $250,000. In the ensuing May, by order of the court, the\r\nmill property with its assets passed into the hands of a newly\r\nconstituted organization, styled the Marine Lumber Company. This\r\ncompany was composed of the creditors of Judd, Walker & Veazie; B. C.\r\nKeater, president; Ed. St. John, superintendent; capital stock,\r\n$750,000. In 1888 the property passed into the hands of Anderson &\r\nO'Brien.\r\n\r\n\r\nVASA VILLAGE\r\n\r\nWas platted in 1856, in section 30, township 32, range 19, by B. F.\r\nand Mary Jane Otis and John Columbus; W. P. Payte, surveyor. James\r\nRussell, James Cilley and Frank Register in 1857 built a steam saw\r\nmill. James Russell built a three story hotel. A saloon and other\r\nbuildings were erected, but the village did not prosper, and the site\r\nis now abandoned.

Hughes.\r\nThey have one son and one daughter.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEWPORT.\r\n\r\nThe town of Newport includes fractional townships 27 and 28, range 22,\r\nand part of sections 34, 35 and 36, in township 29, range 22: It was\r\norganized as a town Oct. 20, 1858. The first supervisors were William\r\nFowler, E. B. Schofield and John Willoughby. The surface is mostly\r\nprairie. This town has some points of great historic interest. Gray\r\nCloud island, in the southern part, in the Mississippi river,\r\nseparated from the mainland by a slough, is the place where, according\r\nto some historians, Le Sueur planted a French fort in 1695. It was\r\nstyled the \"Isle Pelee,\" and was described as a beautiful \"Prairie\r\nIsland.\"\r\n\r\nThe description of the island tallies precisely with that of Gray\r\nCloud, and is applicable to none of the other conjectured localities.\r\nIt is mentioned by many antiquarian writers as a place of rendezvous\r\nfor French traders during the French domination in this part of the\r\ncontinent. Gray Cloud has been known as a trading post for the last\r\nhundred years, and has the credit of being the first white settlement\r\nin Washington county, and probably in Minnesota. Here came Joseph R.\r\nBrown in 1838, and here he married the daughter of Dickson, the\r\ntrader. Hazen Mooers, one of the commissioners of St. Croix county in\r\n1840, Joseph Boucher and others were living at Gray Cloud when the\r\nMethodist mission was established at Kaposia in 1836. Gray Cloud is\r\nthe translation of the Indian name of the island. It was also borne by\r\nan Indian maiden, who became the wife of Hazen Mooers, who seems to\r\nhave been a man of excellent repute and considerable influence. The\r\nBrowns cherished for him a very warm feeling of regard.\r\n\r\nRed Rock, another historic locality, derives its name from a painted\r\nrock which seems to have been held in great reverence by the Sioux\r\nIndians. According to Rev. Chauncey Hobart, a veteran pioneer and\r\npreacher still living in Minnesota, it was the custom among the Sioux\r\nto worship the boulders that lie scattered along the hills and\r\nvalleys. When a Dakotah was in danger, it was his custom to clear a\r\nspot from grass and brush, roll a boulder upon it, paint it, deck it\r\nwith feathers and flowers, and pray to it for needed help.\r\n\r\nThe peculiarity of the painted boulder from which Red Rock took its\r\nname is that it was a shrine, to which from generation to generation\r\npilgrimages were made, and offerings and sacrifices presented. Its\r\nIndian name was \"Eyah Shah,\" or \"Red Rock.\" The stone is not naturally\r\nred, but painted with vermillion, or, as some say, with the blood of\r\nslaughtered victims. The Indians call the stone also \"Waukan,\" or\r\n\"mystery.\" It lies on a weathered stratum of limestone, and seems to\r\nbe a fragment from some distant granite ledge. The Dakotahs say it\r\nwalked or rolled to its present position, and they point to the path\r\nover which it traveled. They visited it occasionally every year until\r\n1862, each time painting it and bringing offerings. It is painted in\r\nstripes, twelve in number, two inches wide and from two to six inches\r\napart. The north end has a rudely drawn picture of the sun, and a rude\r\nface with fifteen rays.\r\n\r\nRed Rock is noted as the site of a mission planted here in 1837 by the\r\nMethodist Episcopal church, by Alfred Brunson, a distinguished pioneer\r\npreacher and missionary. The mission was originally established at\r\nKaposia, on the western bank of the river, in 1837, but removed by\r\nAlfred Brunson in the same year to Red Rock. Rev. B. T. Kavanaugh, of\r\nthis mission, and afterward a bishop of the Methodist Episcopal church\r\nSouth, superintended the erection of the first buildings. Taylor F.\r\nRandolph and wife were teachers here, as assistants in the Indian\r\nschool, and also in a school of mixed bloods and whites. B. T.\r\nKavanaugh was postmaster in 1841. John Holton was mission farmer in\r\n1841, under a commission from Maj. Taliaferro, of Fort Snelling. The\r\nmission was discontinued in 1842. Mr. Randolph and wife made them a\r\nhome in the town of Afton, where both died in 1844.\r\n\r\nThe first marriage was that of John A. Ford to Mary Holton, daughter\r\nof John Holton, in 1843. The first birth was that of Franklin C. Ford,\r\nSeptember, 1844. The first death was that of a child of Rev. B. T.\r\nKavanaugh. The village of Newport was platted in 1857. W. R. Brown's\r\naddition was platted in 1874. A steam saw mill was built in 1857 by E.\r\nM. Shelton & Brothers. The mill was destroyed by fire in 1874. A flour\r\nmill was built in its place by Joseph Irish. The first Baptist church\r\nwas organized Jan. 18, 1858. The first commodious house of worship was\r\nbuilt in 1878. The Red Rock Camp Meeting Association was organized in\r\n1869. A plat of ten acres, beautifully situated in a natural grove\r\nnear the village, and on the line of the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul\r\nrailroad, was donated to the association by John Holton. These grounds\r\nhave been improved, and adorned with tasteful cottages. The camp\r\nmeetings held during the summer are largely attended.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAY CLOUD CITY\r\n\r\nWas platted in June, 1856, by J. R. Brown and Truman W. Smith, and\r\nsurveyed by J. Donald McCullom.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEWPORT VILLAGE\r\n\r\nWas platted May 2, 1857, by Joseph H. Huganin, R. C. Knox, Wm. and\r\nJames Fowler, and surveyed by B. Densmore.\r\n\r\nJOHN HOLTON came to Red Rock in 1831, with the Methodist missionaries;\r\nserved some years as Indian farmer under Maj. Taliaferro, Indian\r\nagent, and afterward settled on a farm just above the mission ground.\r\nHe donated ten acres of this farm to the Methodists for camp meeting\r\ngrounds. Mr. Holton died in 1884, leaving two children, Mrs. Ford and\r\nMrs. Winters.\r\n\r\nJOHN A. FORD was born in Utica, New York, in 1811. He learned the\r\ntrade of edge tool and rifle making, and in 1834 came West with his\r\nfather, locating a land claim where Chicago now stands. In 1841 the\r\nson came to Red Rock and erected a store building in which he sold\r\ngoods for twelve years. Subsequently he engaged in farming. With the\r\nexception of the traders Mr. Ford was the first merchant in Washington\r\ncounty. Mr. Ford was a representative in the second territorial\r\nlegislature. He was married to May Holton in 1843. Their children are\r\nFranklin and Willis. Franklin, the eldest son, was married to Addie\r\nWitherspoon in 1870, and resides in Newport.\r\n\r\nDANIEL HOPKINS, a native of New Hampshire, came West at an early age.\r\nHe was a gunsmith by trade. He located in Green Bay in 1836, and\r\nremoved to Prairie du Chien in 1838, where he built a stone shop with\r\na large double window over his workbench and overlooking a spot where\r\nhe kept his money buried. A large mullein growing over it sufficiently\r\nindicated that his treasure was still undisturbed. Growing somewhat\r\ndoubtful of the security of his hoard, he removed and placed a\r\nthousand dollars in a stone quarry as a safer place of deposit.\r\nUnexpectedly to him, the quarry was reopened and a well placed blast\r\nscattered the old gentleman's treasure to the four winds. He recovered\r\nbut a portion of it. In 1844 he left Prairie du Chien and came to Red\r\nRock. He was three years associated with John A. Ford in selling\r\ngoods, after which, in 1848, he removed to St. Paul, where he opened a\r\nstore. He died in 1852, aged sixty-five years.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM R. BROWN was born in Urbana, Ohio, in 1816. He spent his\r\nboyhood at home on a farm and served as an apprentice to a carpenter\r\nin Mt. Carmel, Illinois. In April, 1848, he came to Red Rock mission\r\nin company with Rev. B. T. Kavanaugh, Charles Cavalier and Julia\r\nBosnell. He lived upon a farm until 1854, when he sold out and removed\r\nto St. Paul, where he dealt in real estate. During the Rebellion he\r\nserved three years in Company C, Sixth Minnesota Volunteers. He was\r\nmarried in 1841 to Martha Neuman. He died Nov. 25, 1874.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM FOWLER settled in Newport in 1852 and has become a prominent\r\nfarmer and successful stockman. His farm, which originally cost him\r\n$2,500, he sold in 1887 for $80,000. He was for two years president of\r\nthe Minnesota Agricultural Society, and five years of the Dairymen's\r\nAssociation. He was a member of the house of representatives in 1872.\r\nDuring the war he served as lieutenant in the Eighth Minnesota\r\nVolunteers.\r\n\r\n\r\nOAKDALE.\r\n\r\nOakdale includes township 29, range 21. Originally it was covered with\r\nwhite, black and burr oak timber; the surface is rolling, and the soil\r\nwell adapted to the cultivation of wheat. It is well watered and has\r\nnumerous lakes, among which Lake Elmo is favorably known as a summer\r\nresort.\r\n\r\nOakdale was organized as a town November, 1858. The first supervisors\r\nwere E. C. Gray, John Bershen and E. L. Morse. The clerk was W.\r\nArmstrong.\r\n\r\nThe first settler was B. B. Cyphers, who kept a hotel or stopping\r\nplace on Sun Fish lake in 1848. The year following John Morgan built a\r\nmore commodious house a mile and a half west on the stage road, and\r\nthis was afterward known as the \"Half-way House,\" it being nearly\r\nmidway between St. Paul and Stillwater. At this well known station the\r\npioneer stages of Willoughby & Powers changed horses at noon, and the\r\npassengers took dinner. In 1855 the property passed into the hands of\r\nE. C. Gray. The Malones, Lohmans, Grays, Day, Stevens, and Gardiner\r\nlocated here in the '50s.\r\n\r\nThe first post office established was in 1857, in the south part of\r\nthe town, in section 35. Arthur Stephens was for ten years postmaster.\r\nThe office was called Oakdale, and was discontinued and another\r\nestablished at the Half-way House, and called Lohmanville post office.\r\nIn 1873 it was transferred to the Oakdale station on the railroad. It\r\nwas discontinued in 1876, and re-established at Bass Lake station,\r\nwhere it has since remained but is now known as the Lake Elmo post\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nThe St. Paul & Stillwater railroad passes through this town from east\r\nto west. It has three stations, Lake Elmo, Oakdale and Midvale.\r\n\r\nThe churches of Oakdale are the St. John's Lutheran and the Church of\r\nthe Holy Angels. These churches have fine buildings and good\r\ncongregations. The buildings are located on the line of the old stage\r\nroad, and have spacious burial grounds attached.\r\n\r\nLake Elmo is the only village in the town. It is handsomely located on\r\nLake Elmo. The company that platted the village has expended over\r\n$65,000 on improvements. The hotel is an elegant and spacious\r\nbuilding, and a favorite resort for summer tourists. The lake was\r\noriginally known as Bass lake, and the station was known as Bass Lake\r\nstation. In 1879 the lake and station were rechristened Elmo, a name\r\ncertainly more musical and charming than the original, and inferior\r\nonly to the aboriginal name, which ought to have been retained.\r\n\r\nE. C. GRAY came originally from Pennsylvania, and located in Oakdale\r\nin 1855, having purchased the Half-way House of John Morgan. He died\r\nin 1874, leaving a large family of children. Two of his sons, M. P.\r\nand W. H., remain on the family homestead. Others are in St. Paul. All\r\nare known as men of good business ability.\r\n\r\nARTHUR STEPHENS was born in Scotland in 1830. He came to America in\r\n1839, lived awhile in Illinois, learned the trade of a mason and\r\nplasterer, came to St. Paul in 1849, worked at his trade until 1854,\r\nwhen he removed to Oakdale, where, with the exception of six years'\r\nresidence at Stillwater, he has since lived. Mr. Stephens served as\r\npostmaster ten years, as county commissioner three years, and has\r\nfilled town offices. He was married to Marie Payden in 1852. Their\r\nchildren are Harris S., Arthur, Elizabeth and Emma.\r\n\r\n\r\nONEKA.\r\n\r\nThe town comprises township 31, range 21. It was organized as a town\r\nin 1880. A. J. Soule was the first moderator, George Walker the first\r\nclerk and treasurer. The eastern and southern portions are\r\ndiversified, being quite rugged and uneven. The western part is quite\r\nlevel, and was originally timbered with burr oak and poplars. The town\r\nabounds with lakes. Bald Eagle lies partly in the town; Oneka; Rice,\r\nEgg, Eagle, Horseshoe, and others are within the town. Small springs\r\nand rivulets abound. A tamarack swamp, varying in width from a few\r\nrods to a half mile, traverses the town from north to south, forming a\r\nnatural barrier between the eastern and western divisions. The\r\nprincipal lake is Oneka, located in sections 9 and 16. Rice lake has\r\nbeen celebrated as the resort of Indians from Mendota, who camped here\r\nannually to gather wild rice for the St. Paul and Minneapolis markets.\r\n\r\nThe first settlers were Fayette Tainter and John Chester, young men\r\nwho came together in 1850 for the purpose of locating claims and\r\nbaling hay. They carried on a stock farm for five years. The next\r\nsettlers, Lewis Sempler and his son-in-law, Joseph Freeman, came in\r\n1855. They were followed by Dunn, Barnum, Hatch and Beecroft.\r\n\r\nThe St. Paul & Duluth railroad passes through the western part of the\r\ntown, entering in section 31, and leaving in section 5. There is but\r\none station upon the road, Centreville, a thriving little village,\r\nhaving a hotel, store, school house, etc. Its post office was\r\nestablished in 1874.\r\n\r\nThe first school district was organized in 1867. Ruth Miller taught\r\nthe first school. The first marriage was that of Joseph Lambert and\r\nMary Courtone. The first child born was Hoyt E., son of O. L. Kinyon,\r\nDec. 27, 1863. The first death was that of Herbert, son of O. L.\r\nKinyon, May 30, 1869.\r\n\r\n\r\nONEKA,\r\n\r\nLocated in the northeast quarter of section 8, was platted May, 1847,\r\nby Franklin Jones; Chas. B. Lowell, surveyor.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHADY SIDE VILLAGE,\r\n\r\nLocated on Bald Eagle lake, was platted in 1880, by Chas. P. Hill;\r\nBrinckerhoff & Phillips, surveyors.\r\n\r\nDANIEL HOPKINS, SR., son of Daniel Hopkins, of whom biographical\r\nmention is made in the history of Newport, was born in New Hampshire.\r\nHe came to St. Paul in 1850, and engaged in the mercantile business on\r\nThird street until 1852, when he removed to a farm between St. Anthony\r\nand St. Paul, and dealt extensively in blooded stock until about\r\n1855-56, when he purchased the farms of Austin and Tainter, on Rice\r\ncreek near the railroad. His farm consists of about 600 acres. The\r\nrailroad has a flag station at the farm known as Hopkins station.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTILLWATER.\r\n\r\nStillwater comprises fractional township 30, range 20, excepting the\r\nsite of the city of Stillwater. The surface is rolling and the soil\r\ngood. It is well watered with rivulets and small lakes. The first\r\nsettlers in the town outside the city limits were the Lymans,\r\nconsisting of the father (Cornelius) and two sons, C. Storrs and D.\r\nP., Charles Macy, W. T. Boutwell, Sebastian Marty, Wm. Rutherford, J.\r\nJ. McKenzie, Albion Masterman, and Dr. James Carey. The first white\r\nchild born in the town was Emily S., daughter of C. S. Lyman, in 1846.\r\nThe first death was that of Betsey, daughter of C. S. Lyman, in 1846.\r\nThe first marriage was that of Abraham Click and Jane Sample, in 1853.\r\nThe first school was taught by Cynthia Pond, in 1852. The first road\r\nthrough the town was from Dakota village via Carnelian lake and Marine\r\nto St. Croix Falls. Messrs. Rutherford & Booth in 1857 built a flour\r\nmill on Brown's creek, which empties into the St. Croix near the head\r\nof the lake. The mill was located above McKusick's lake, and has been\r\nfor some years abandoned. Brown's creek originally passed through\r\nsections 18, 19, 20 and 21 to the river, but was turned in 1843 from\r\nits natural course, and made to connect McKusick's lake with the St.\r\nCroix by a new channel cut through sections 28 and 29, thus giving to\r\nStillwater its initial advantages as a manufacturing centre. The\r\nWashington county poor farm, consisting of 207 acres of improved laud\r\nwith good buildings and other conveniences, was located in this town\r\nin 1858.\r\n\r\n\r\nOAK PARK\r\n\r\nWas platted May 27, 1857. It is situated between the city of\r\nStillwater and South Stillwater, with frontage on the lake. The\r\nproprietors were John Parker, Wm. Dorr, Gold T. Curtis, Mary Curtis,\r\nOlive A. B. Anderson, and Wm. M. McCluer. The surveyor was A. Van\r\nVoorhes.\r\n\r\nThe township of Stillwater was organized April 3, 1860, with the\r\nfollowing board of officers: Moderator, Cornelius Lyman; judges of\r\nelection, H. Packard, W. T. Boutwell, D. P. Lyman; supervisors, C.\r\nStorrs Lyman, H. Packard, Henry A. Jackman; clerk, Sylvanus Trask.\r\n\r\nDAVID P. LYMAN was born in St. Lawrence county, New York, in 1822. In\r\n1844 he came with his parents to Marine. In 1846 he removed to his\r\npresent residence in the town of Stillwater. He was married to Anna J.\r\nHannah, at Farmingdale, Illinois, in 1850.

JACKMAN, a native of Robbinstown, Maine, was born July 30,\r\n1819. He was married to Sarah Blanchard in 1848. Mr. Jackman, with his\r\nfamily, his father and his wife's parents, came West in 1849 and\r\nlocated in Stillwater. In 1851 he removed to his farm. He has since\r\nengaged in farming and lumbering, and has filled several important\r\npositions. He served as school trustee for 30 years, as county\r\ncommissioner 8 years, as warden of state prison 4 years, as state\r\nprison inspector 20 years, and was a representative in the territorial\r\nlegislature of 1856, and the state legislature of 1867.

He was a man honored\r\nfor his kindness and sterling integrity. His wife, the mother of Henry\r\nA., died in Maine in 1844. Three sons and four daughters survive them.\r\nThe children of Henry A. Jackman are Mary E. (Mrs. Russell Pease),\r\nJames E. and Alice (Mrs. Wm. A. Boxwell).\r\n\r\nFREDERIC J. CURTIS, a native of Ireland, was born in 1818. Before\r\ncoming to America he learned the trade of boot and shoe making. He\r\ncame to America in 1843, and spent two years in New York City working\r\nat his trade. He also spent two years in St. Louis and New Orleans. He\r\ncame to Stillwater in 1848 and settled on his farm in section 9, where\r\nhe has since lived. He held the office of sheriff two years. He was\r\none of the first police of the city of Stillwater and has been town\r\ntreasurer and school director. He was married to Bridget Fenton in\r\n1849. Their children are Daniel, Thomas, James, Elisabeth, Mary,\r\nMaggie, and Ellen B.\r\n\r\nDAVID COVER was born in Westmoreland county, Pennsylvania, May 22,\r\n1826. In 1844 he came with his parents to St. Louis, Missouri, where\r\nhe became a river pilot, and engaged in lumbering for eight years,\r\nwhen he came to Stillwater, and for some years gave his attention\r\nlargely to selling logs and lumber between Stillwater and St. Louis.\r\nDuring the years between 1860 and 1870 his business transactions were\r\nheavy, involving hundreds of thousands of dollars annually, and from\r\nsome injudicious movements, due to lack of experience, resulted in\r\ndisastrous failure. After his failure he devoted himself to farming\r\nand fire insurance business. He was married in 1850 to Elisabeth\r\nHarrold. They are the parents of three sons. Mr. Cover was\r\naccidentally drowned in Lake St. Croix Sept. 14, 1884. His life was\r\ninsured for $17,000.\r\n\r\nJOHN PARKER came from Vermont to the valley of the St. Croix in 1848,\r\nlocated for a couple of years at St. Croix Falls, and came to Oak\r\nPark, town of Stillwater, about 1850. In 1848 Mr. Parker was married\r\nto Susan, daughter of David Cover, who bore him three children: Edwin\r\nE., the oldest, killed by the explosion of the boilers of the steamer\r\nPenn Wright, near Winona; John E., living at home with his mother, and\r\nElla, wife of Henry Pevey, of Stillwater. Mr. Parker was a kind\r\nhearted, genial man. He was one of the early river pilots, and came to\r\nhis death in June, 1867, while in the performance of his duties as a\r\npilot. In handling a line to \"snub\" a raft, he was caught in its coils\r\nand so bruised that he died.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOODBURY,\r\n\r\nAs at present organized, includes township 28, range 21. At the date\r\nof its organization, in 1868, it was named Red Rock, and made to\r\ninclude a little over two sections of fractional township 28, range\r\n22. This fragment contains the famous painted rock, now included in\r\nthe town of Newport, and from this rock, familiarly called Red Rock,\r\nthe town received its first name. The first board of town officers\r\nconsisted of John Colby; moderator; David Little and C. Schmeiding,\r\njudges of election; John Colby, John A. Ford, J. J. Miller,\r\nsupervisors; Ebenezer Ayers, clerk.\r\n\r\nThe town held the name of Red Rock until 1859, when, by notification\r\nfrom the legislature that another town bore the same name, the board\r\nchanged the name to Woodbury, a name given in honor of Judge Woodbury,\r\nof New Hampshire, a particular friend of Mr. Colby, at that time\r\nchairman of the board. The fraction containing the painted rock was\r\nset off by order of the board of county commissioners, meeting at\r\nStillwater in 1861, and added to Newport. It is said that this act did\r\nnot meet with the hearty approval of the citizens of the town.\r\n\r\nThe town was originally timbered with various species of oak. The\r\nsurface is undulating, and in the western part there are abrupt hills\r\nor bluffs. It is a fine agricultural town, well watered with creeks,\r\nsprings and small lakes.\r\n\r\nThe first settlers were the McHatties, Middletons, Robert Cummings,\r\nJohn Towner, and Joseph Cooper. The first marriage was that of John\r\nMcHattie and Jane Middleton, Jan. 15, 1847. The first child born was\r\nSarah Middleton, afterward the wife of Anthony Fritz, of Newport. The\r\nfirst death was that of Sarah Middleton, May 4, 1849. The first\r\ntraveled road in the town was from Stillwater to St. Paul via\r\nBissell's Mound. The first post office was established in 1850, at\r\nOakdale, in the northern part of the town; G. Hartoung, postmaster.\r\nThe first school was taught in 1855 by Miss A. F. Colby. The German\r\nMethodist church was organized in 1855; Rev. Jacob Young, pastor. The\r\nchurch and parsonage are built of stone. The Salem Evangelical\r\nLutheran church was organized in 1865; Rev. J. W. Huffman, pastor.\r\n\r\nJACOB FOLSTROM.--The history of Jacob Folstrom reads like a romance.\r\nHe was born in Sweden June 25, 1793, and when he was nine years of age\r\nleft home as cabin boy on a steamer commanded by his uncle. The\r\nsteamer was wrecked on the coast of England. He escaped with his uncle\r\nto London, and there lost sight of him. What was his uncle's fate he\r\nnever knew. He understood nothing of the English language, and\r\napplied to the Swedish consul for aid. Lord Selkirk was then raising a\r\ncompany of men to go to his settlement on Red river, British America,\r\nand Selkirk, who could speak Swedish, spoke kindly to the friendless\r\nlad, and offered to take him with him to the New World. He, not\r\nknowing what else to do, consented to go. After his arrival he found\r\nemployment with the Hudson Bay Company for a time, and subsequently\r\ncame down to the Fort Snelling reservation. When the settlers were\r\ndriven from the reservation in 1839; he made a farm in what is now\r\nWoodbury, Washington county. At Lake Superior, in 1823, he had been\r\nmarried to Margaret Burgo, a woman of fine mind. With her limited\r\neducational privileges, very few of any age or race can be found her\r\nequal. Mr. and Mrs. Folstrom were both consistent Christians, and\r\nmembers of the Methodist church for many years. He lived a stirring,\r\nadventurous life, and, during his service as mail carrier between\r\nPrairie du Chien and Fort Snelling, he had many hairbreadth escapes\r\nfrom hostile Indians. He died in July, 1859. His wife survived him\r\ntill Feb. 6, 1880.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER MCHATTIE.--At the age of sixteen Mr. McHattie left his home\r\nand worked as a teamster and farmer for about five years; and in 1833\r\ncame from Scotland, his native country, to America. He lived a couple\r\nof years in Vermont, a short time in New York, Ohio and Indiana. In\r\n1839 he came to Galena, Illinois, and migrated thence in the same year\r\nto St. Croix Falls. He also made a short stay at Gray Cloud island;\r\nwas in Prescott in 1840; in 1841 made a home in Afton, and in 1845 at\r\nWoodbury. He married Margaret Middleton in 1848.\r\n\r\nJOHN MCHATTIE.--John, the oldest brother of Alexander McHattie, came\r\nfrom Scotland to this country in 1833, and settled in Woodbury in\r\n1841. He was married in 1846 to Jane Middleton.\r\n\r\nTHE MIDDLETON FAMILY.--James Middleton, Sr., with his wife, three\r\nsons, William, Samuel, and James, and five daughters, came to this\r\ncountry from Ireland. William, the oldest, inspired by filial duty,\r\ncame first, it being his ambition to secure for his parents a home on\r\nAmerican soil. He was not of age when, in 1838, he left Ireland, full\r\nof hope and enthusiasm for his project. He found his way to St. Louis\r\nin 1842, and came thence with Hungerford & Livingston to St. Croix\r\nFalls. He remained with them two years and then, removing further\r\nsouth, made a claim on unsurveyed government land in what is now the\r\ntown of Woodbury. During the succeeding year, 1845, he and his brother\r\nSamuel worked for John McKusick, and by diligence and self denial\r\nsucceeded in earning enough to pay the passage of his father and his\r\nfamily to the United States, and to bring them to their claim on the\r\nprairie. It was a joyful day when the parents arrived, and since then\r\nthe united family have their home at and near the selected homestead,\r\na model family in their unity of purpose and affectionate regard for\r\neach other. William visited California. He died at his home in 1855.\r\nSamuel enlisted and did gallant service in the Union Army during the\r\nlate Civil War as a member of Company E, Tenth Minnesota Volunteers,\r\nand died in the hospital at Memphis, Feb. 29, 1865. James, a younger\r\nbrother, was born in 1833. He made a claim near that of his brother,\r\nand is prominent in the community, in which he lives. He was\r\nsergeant-at-arms in the legislature, a member of the house in 1876,\r\nand served five years in Washington county as county commissioner. Mr.\r\nMiddleton removed to St. Paul in 1880, where he now resides. The\r\nfather died in 1854, the mother in 1876.\r\n\r\nNEWINGTON GILBERT was born in Onondaga county, New York, Feb. 17,\r\n1815. Mr. Gilbert settled in Woodbury in 1851. In company with Mr.\r\nBuswell he built the North Star flouring mill in 1860. He operated\r\nthis mill eleven years. Mr. Gilbert was a member of the Democratic\r\nwing of the constitutional convention in 1857. He was married to\r\nCelestia Bangs in 1860. They have two children.\r\n\r\nEBENEZER AYERS was born in Herkimer county, New York. His early life\r\nwas devoted to hard labor, still such was his zeal for study and the\r\nacquisition of general knowledge, that he managed to acquire a very\r\nrespectable and thorough education. In 1856 he came with his parents\r\nto Fort Wayne. He commenced teaching school soon after and taught\r\neight years. In 1844 he removed to Shelby county, Kentucky. He was\r\nmarried in 1846 to Lucy Connelly, of Shelby county. He removed to\r\nBuffalo, New York, in 1850, and sold goods until the spring of 1854,\r\nwhen he located in Woodbury and engaged in farming. He was a man of\r\nenergy, and possessed of great will power. He took a deep interest in\r\ntown and county affairs, and served as town clerk in Woodbury eleven\r\nyears. He was a representative in the Minnesota state legislature in\r\n1867 and 1872, and while in that capacity proved himself a ready\r\ndebater. He had natural ability as an organizer. He was an active\r\nmember of the Greenback party, and was rigidly opposed to monopolies.\r\nHe died in 1883.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON COUNTY--CONTINUED.\r\n\r\n\r\nCITY OF STILLWATER.\r\n\r\nThe organization of the territory of Minnesota in 1849 naturally gave\r\na new impetus to settlement, and marked an era in the progress of the\r\nsettlements already made. None profited more by the new order of\r\nthings than did Stillwater. The future metropolis of the St. Croix\r\nvalley, though yet unorganized even as a village, and governed by town\r\nand county law, in 1850 presented a scene of unwonted activity. Out of\r\nnearly a hundred arrivals we find the names of John C, Gardiner,\r\nSamuel M. Register, H. C. Van Voorhees, John N. Ahl, Ralph Wheeler,\r\nDr. E. G. Pugsley, Dr. Morey, dentist, and Theodore E. Parker, a\r\nlawyer. This year was rendered notable by the establishment of a\r\nlivery stable, by Holcomb & Johnson, a new store by Burkelo & Mower, a\r\nbakery by R. Hersey, by the building of the second saw mill by Sawyer\r\n& Heaton, by the commencement of Remmick's brewery, by the advent of\r\nAntonio Brothers' circus, and the occurrence of a remarkable freshet,\r\non which occasion the steamer Lamartine, taking advantage of the high\r\nwater, made a pleasure excursion up the river, and over the shallows\r\nat the mouth of Apple river and a short distance up that stream.\r\nMorton Wilkinson and Michael Ames were amongst the excursionists, and,\r\nlooking out from the steamboat upon the broad, deep expanse of the\r\nswollen river, congratulated their fellow passengers upon the\r\ndiscovery of a hitherto unknown navigable stream, tributary to the\r\nmajestic St. Croix. The Swiss Bell Ringers were on board, and added\r\ngreatly to the pleasure of the occasion by their weird and peculiar\r\nmusic. The Lamartine, on returning to Stillwater, found the shores\r\nand levees submerged, and passing over them landed her passengers\r\ndirectly from the boat upon the floor of the Minnesota House, on the\r\nsouthwest corner of Chestnut and Main. The water was four or five feet\r\ndeep in the street before the hotel. The streets in the lower part of\r\nthe city have since been raised several feet, so that a flood of the\r\nsame dimensions would not overflow them as it did then. There has,\r\nhowever, in the memory of the oldest inhabitant, been no other flood\r\nequal to that of 1850.\r\n\r\nAllusion has been made in the history of Stillwater town to the\r\ndiversion of the waters of McKusick's lake by a new outlet to the\r\nriver. This device, so beneficial to the city of Stillwater in other\r\nrespects, came near resulting in disaster. The old outlet of the lake\r\nhad been obstructed by a dam, while the waters were conducted by a new\r\noutlet down a deep ravine and confined to their channel by dikes\r\nconsisting of a mixture of clay, sand and gravel. This extended to\r\nwithin six hundred feet of the mill on the lake shore. On May 14,\r\n1852, during a terrible storm, the dam at the new outlet gave way and\r\na tremendous body of water, carrying with it the debris of dikes and\r\ndams, rushed tumultuously down the ravine, covering the low shores of\r\nthe lake beneath, and depositing a new geological stratum of drift\r\nover a surface of at least six acres to an average depth of about ten\r\nfeet. It was wittily said at the time that such an extraordinary\r\nmovement in real estate had never before been known; but, although a\r\ndownward movement, that seemed very much like ruin to all concerned,\r\nespecially to the mill, the machinery of which was completely buried,\r\nit nevertheless heralded a rise in prices. Quagmires were filled,\r\nunsightly obstructions buried or swept away and a fine plateau for\r\nbuildings was formed along the lake.\r\n\r\nThe dam was replaced and greatly strengthened, and the water was\r\nconducted through pipes and hydrants to the city. Occasionally, for\r\nyears afterward, the diggers of cellars or cisterns in the buried\r\nregion would unearth interesting antediluvian relics. Three barrels of\r\npork were exhumed from the cellar of McKusick's store, and found in a\r\ngood state of preservation. Some years later remains of a far more\r\nancient character were also unearthed near the corner of Third and\r\nMyrtle streets. The tusk of a mastodon was brought up from a depth of\r\nthirty-six feet below the surface.\r\n\r\n\r\nCITY GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\nStillwater was incorporated as a city in 1854. The following officers\r\nwere elected on the first Monday in April of that year: Mayor, John\r\nMcKusiek; recorder, C. D. Gilfillan; treasurer, W. H. Mower;\r\nCouncilmen, J. C. York, J. N. Masterman, C. Carli. We append a list of\r\nmayors from 1854 to the present time: John McKusick, 1854; John\r\nFisher, 1855; Wm. Willim, 1856-66-67; Albert Stinson, 1857; A. B.\r\nGorgas, 1858; T. M. Fullerton, 1859; Mahlon Black, 1860-61; F. R.\r\nDelano, 1862; David Bronson, 1863-64; Wm. Grover, 1865; C. J. Butler,\r\n1868; Wm. Holcombe, 1869-70; Wm. McKusick, 1871-72; A. K. Doe, 1873;\r\nWm. G. Bronson, 1874-75-76; E. W. Durant, 1877; John S. Proctor,\r\n1878-79-80; Samuel Mathews, 1881-82-83-84; Hollis R. Murdock, 1885;\r\nIsaac Staples, 1886; George M. Seymour, 1887-88.\r\n\r\n\r\nCITY MARSHALS.\r\n\r\nThe following is a complete list of city marshals since 1854: Jonathan\r\nE. McKusick, 1854; John Parker, 1855; John Cilly, 1856; Dennis\r\nSullivan, 1557; Robert Hasty, 1858; Thomas Sinclair, 1859; Duncan\r\nChisholm, 1860-61-62-63; John Shortall, 1864-65; John May, 1866, six\r\nmonths; P. E. Keefe, 1867; John May, 1868, six months; John Shortall,\r\n1869; H. McIntyre, 1870; Duncan Chisholm, 1871; John Lyons, 1872-3,\r\neighteen months; Mathew Shortall, 1873, and continuously to the\r\npresent time. Mr. Shortall's long term of office proves him an\r\neffective and popular officer. F. L. McKusick is police court officer.\r\nHe is a veteran of the police force and has acquitted himself to the\r\nsatisfaction of the people of Stillwater.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POST OFFICE,\r\n\r\nEstablished in 1845, was located first at the corner of Main and\r\nChestnut streets. The first postmaster was Elam Greely. His successors\r\nwere John McKusick, John S. Proctor, Harley D. Curtis, Mahlon Black,\r\nAbraham Van Voorhes, H. D. Cutler, E. J. Butts, and ---- McCarthy.\r\nDuring 1845 a citizens' mail was brought from Point Douglas. Its\r\nregularity depended somewhat on the season. During the winter it was\r\nbrought some times as infrequently as once a month. In 1846 a\r\ngovernment line was established from Point Douglas, and the mail was\r\nbrought with greater regularity. In 1848 a mail coach line was\r\nestablished between Stillwater and St. Paul. The year following a\r\nweekly mail was established. The rapid increase of settlements on the\r\nUpper Mississippi created a demand for more frequent mails;\r\nconsequently from 1850 to the completion of the railroad leading into\r\nStillwater, a daily mail was brought into Stillwater during the summer\r\nby steamboats, and by the Wisconsin overland route during the winter.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAPID GROWTH.\r\n\r\nAs an evidence of the growth of the city we append post office\r\nstatistics of salaries, expenses and income for the year 1885:\r\n\r\nRECEIPTS.\r\n\r\nSales of postage stamps, envelopes,\r\n  newspaper wrappers, postal cards, etc.             $12,693 34\r\nBox rent received                                      2,166 25\r\n                                                    -----------\r\n      Total                                          $14,859 59\r\n\r\nEXPENSES.\r\n\r\nPostmaster's salary                      $2,400 00\r\nExpenses for rent, fuel, lights, clerk\r\n  hire, etc.                              3,300 00    $5,700 00\r\n                                                     ----------\r\n     Net income                                       $9,159 59\r\n\r\nMONEY ORDER BUSINESS.\r\n\r\nReceived for domestic orders                         $30,305 62\r\nReceived for fees on same                                131 50\r\nReceived for international orders                      1,518 81\r\nReceived for fees on same                                 24 95\r\n                                                     ----------\r\n                                                     $31,980 88\r\nMoney orders paid                       $24,140 88\r\nCertificates of deposit                   7,840 00   $31,980 88\r\n\r\nREGISTRY BUSINESS.\r\n\r\nDomestic and foreign letters and packages registered   1,621\r\nRegistered matter in transit                           2,327\r\n                                                       -----\r\nTotal pieces handled                                   3,948\r\n\r\nNumber of pouches dispatched daily                                  24\r\nNumber of pouches dispatched semi-weekly                             2\r\nNumber of pouches received daily                                    24\r\nNumber of pouches received semi-weekly                               2\r\n\r\n\r\nHOTELS.\r\n\r\nThe following hotels were built in Stillwater prior to 1850:\r\n\r\n     Northrup House, built by Anson Northrup, northwest corner\r\n     Main street and Nelson alley, 1844.\r\n\r\n     Stillwater House, built by Anson Northrup, lot 2, Main\r\n     street, 1845.\r\n\r\n     Minnesota House, built by Elam Greeley, southwest corner\r\n     Main and Myrtle, 1846.\r\n\r\n     Lake House, built by John W.

It was built in 1857, by Henry Sawyer, opened by G. E.\r\nB. Whitcher, and kept in succession by J. and A. Lowell, Isaac\r\nStaples, A. Lowell and A. K. Doe. The other hotels built during this\r\nperiod were the Liberty House, by John N.

In 1855 he issued and redeemed fractional\r\ncurrency. Darling, Caswell & Scheffer, Jan. 27, 1857, opened a private\r\nbanking house, and from 1859 to 1865 operated it as a state bank, when\r\nit was changed into the\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST NATIONAL BANK\r\n\r\nof Stillwater. The capital stock was $50,000. The first officers were:\r\nCharles Scheffer, president; O. R. Ellis, cashier. The officers in\r\n1886 were: Louis Hospes, president; C. N. Nelson, vice president; F.\r\nM. Prince, cashier. The capital stock is $250,000. The gross amount of\r\ndebits and credits during the year closing June 3, 1886, were\r\n$20,000,000. We append the annual report of 1886:\r\n\r\nRESOURCES.\r\n\r\nLoans and discounts                                        $727,286 70\r\nOverdrafts                                                    1,745 82\r\nUnited States bonds to secure circulation                    50,000 00\r\nDue from approved reserve agents              $30,999 72\r\nDue from other national banks                   4,266 85\r\nDue from state banks and bankers                3,491 48     38,758 05\r\nReal estate, furniture and fixtures                          12,000 00\r\nCurrent expenses and taxes paid                              11,108 56\r\nPremiums paid                                                 9,000 00\r\nChecks and other cash items                     1,662 91\r\nBills of other banks                            1,295 00\r\nFractional paper currency, nickels and pennies     77 07\r\nSpecie                                         33,392 00\r\nLegal tender notes                             17,440 00     53,866 98\r\nRedemption fund with United States treasurer\r\n   (five per cent of circulation)                             2,250 00\r\n                                                           -----------\r\nTotal                                                      $906,016 11\r\n\r\nLIABILITIES.\r\n\r\nCapital stock paid in                                      $250,000 00\r\nSurplus fund                                                 60,000 00\r\nUndivided profits                                            25,617 60\r\nNational bank notes outstanding                              45,000 00\r\nDividends unpaid                                                 20 00\r\nIndividual deposits subject to check         $236,095 72\r\nDemand certificates of deposit                  6,305 93\r\nTime certificates of deposit                  224,223 41\r\nCashier's checks outstanding                      679 95\r\nDue to other national banks                     3,507 67\r\nDue to state banks and bankers                  5,266 78    476,079 46\r\nNotes and bills rediscounted                                 49,299 05\r\n                                                            ----------\r\nTotal                                                      $906,016 11\r\n\r\n\r\nLUMBERMAN'S NATIONAL BANK,\r\n\r\nOrganized Jan. 10, 1871.

The present\r\nofficers are: President, Isaac Staples; vice president, R. F. Hersey;\r\nboard of directors, Isaac Staples, R. F. Hersey, E. S. Edgerton, David\r\nTozer, E. W. Durant, David Bronson, J. McKusick, Matt Clark, Wm. G.\r\nBronson, E. L. Hersey, R. S. Davis.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTILLWATER SAVINGS BANK,\r\n\r\nOrganized Jan. 10, 1873, under an act of the legislature of 1867, with\r\nthe following board of trustees: Isaac Staples, president; David\r\nBronson, Dwight M. Sabin, Lewis E. Torinus, Wm. Willim, I. E. Staples,\r\nand H. W. Cannon.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. CROIX LUMBERMEN'S BOARD OF TRADE\r\n\r\nWas incorporated March 8, 1867. The first officers were: President,\r\nDavid Cover; vice president, Louis Hospes; secretary, E. W. Durant;\r\ntreasurer, David Bronson, Jr.; surveyor, Ivory E. McKusick.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTILLWATER BOARD OF TRADE.\r\n\r\nThe board was organized in January, 1871. The first officers were:\r\nPresident, David Bronson; vice president, C. J. Butler; secretary, D.\r\nW. Armstrong; treasurer, C. N. Nelson; board of directors, John\r\nMcKusick, Isaac Staples, J. E. Schlenk, J. O'Shaughnessy, M. Moffatt,\r\nE. W. Durant, J. N. Castle, B. G. Merry, G. M. Seymour, L. E. Torinus.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTILLWATER WATER COMPANY.\r\n\r\nThe site of the city abounds in beautiful springs. Charles Hathaway,\r\nwhile excavating on his lot near Third street, struck a large vein\r\ncapable of supplying 1,000 barrels per day. He constructed a reservoir\r\nwith an elevation of about fifty feet above the street, and from this\r\nsource supplies the city with water for sprinkling streets and other\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nThe Stillwater Water Company was organized April 15, 1880, with a\r\ncapital stock of $100,000, and commenced at once the work of\r\nimprovement. This company has never yet declared a dividend, having\r\napplied all its surplus earnings upon improvements. They have now 8\r\n1/2 miles of water mains, 88 hydrants and about 260 taps. The water\r\nsupply is obtained from Lake McKusick, which is supplied from Brown's\r\ncreek. The lake is 155 feet above the business portion of the city and\r\nis about a mile distant from the same. The water is pumped into a\r\nreservoir on the highest spot of ground in the city, which is 110 feet\r\nabove the lake. The system is similar to that of St. Paul, the city\r\nbeing supplied in part by gravitation, and in part by direct pressure.\r\nThe elevation of the reservoir results in a saving to the city in the\r\nmatter of fire engines, etc. Any fire in the business part of the city\r\ncan be extinguished with the use of hose alone. One fire engine\r\nanswers the purposes of the city. The first board of officers were:\r\nPresident, Edward Durant; vice president, R. F. Hersey; secretary and\r\ntreasurer, H. W. Cannon.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRE DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\nFutile efforts had been made as early as 1859 for the organization of\r\na fire department. In 1872 a fire company of sixty was organized and\r\nan engine worth $7,500 was purchased. The first officers of the\r\ncompany were: Chief engineer, David Bronson; first assistant, B. G.\r\nMerry; second assistant, H. P. West; engineer, C. C. Johnson;\r\nsecretary; N. T. Lee; treasurer, Fayette Marsh.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ST. CROIX HOOK AND LADDER COMPANY\r\n\r\nWas organized in 1872, by the election of the following officers:\r\nForeman, Charles McMillan; assistant, D. B. Loomis; secretary and\r\ntreasurer, A. K. Doe. The company has received awards of honor for\r\nmeritorious performance of duty.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTILLWATER GASLIGHT COMPANY.\r\n\r\nThis company was organized May 12, 1874, with a capital stock of\r\n$25,000 and the exclusive right to the sale and manufacture of gas for\r\na period of forty years.

Sabin, Isaac Staples,\r\nDavid Bronson, L. E. Torinus, H. W. Cannon, C. H. Nash.\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAPH OFFICE.\r\n\r\nIn 1863 a telegraph office was located in Stillwater by a A. C. Lull,\r\nand a line extended to St. Paul. The office is on Main street between\r\nChestnut and Myrtle.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NATIONAL BELL TELEPHONE COMPANY\r\n\r\nEstablished a line from Stillwater to St. Paul in January, 1880. It\r\nhas a branch to Marine.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNION ELEVATOR COMPANY\r\n\r\nBuilt an elevator near the Stillwater & White Bear depot in 1870-71.\r\nIt has a capacity of 300,000 bushels.

This company was succeeded\r\nin 1858 by the American, and in 1869 the United States also\r\nestablished an office here.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STILLWATER BRIDGE.\r\n\r\nA charter was obtained from the legislature in 1875 to build a bridge\r\nacross Lake St. Croix, from Stillwater to Houlton. The bridge was\r\ncompleted the ensuing year at a cost of $24,000. It is 1,500 feet\r\nlong, and is furnished with a pontoon draw 300 feet in length,\r\noperated by an engine.\r\n\r\n\r\nLUMBERING INTERESTS.\r\n\r\nStillwater is the metropolis of the lumbering interests of the St.\r\nCroix valley, and is indebted to them chiefly for its welfare. These\r\nare considered separately in other parts of this history. The local\r\ninterests are centred chiefly in mills and manufactories, of\r\nthemselves an important element in the prosperity of the city. The\r\nprincipal proprietors of the saw mills since the first settlement of\r\nStillwater have been McKusick & Co., Sawyer & Heaton, McHale. & Co.,\r\nSchulenberg & Co., Hersey, Staples & Co., Hersey, Bean & Brown, Isaac\r\nStaples, Seymour, Sabin & Co., Herschey Lumbering Company and Turnbull\r\nLumbering Company.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLOURING MILLS.\r\n\r\nIn 1872 J. H. Townshend and W. F. Cahill erected a flouring mill on\r\nThird street. It was run by water brought from McKusick creek, the\r\nmotive power being an overshot wheel forty-five feet in diameter. In\r\n1880 D. M. Sabin became interested in the firm. The capacity of the\r\nmill was increased from fifty to three hundred barrels per day. A\r\nCorliss engine and other improvements were added, and the mill was run\r\non the Hungarian roller system. The firm name was changed to Townshend\r\n& Co.\r\n\r\nThe St. Croix flouring mill was built in 1877, on Upper Main street,\r\nnear the lake, by Isaac Staples. Its dimensions were 40 × 50 feet. Its\r\ncapacity was two hundred and fifty barrels per day. It was removed to\r\nmake way for the buildings of the Car Company.\r\n\r\nThe Stillwater Flour Mill Company was organized under state laws in\r\n1878, and mills were erected on the lower levee, 50 × 70 feet, ground\r\nplan, and five stories high. These mills were run on the Hungarian\r\nroller system. The cost was $100,000. Their capacity is four hundred\r\nbarrels per day. The motive power is a Corliss engine of one hundred\r\nand seventy-five horse power. The principal owners are R. F. Hersey,\r\nSmith Ellison, D. M. Sabin and L. Hospes.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANUFACTORIES.\r\n\r\nSwain's machine shop, D. M. Swain, proprietor, was established in\r\n1873, on Third street between Myrtle and Chestnut. Geo. Swain\r\nestablished a foundry on Third street in 1874. His manufactures\r\nconsist chiefly of engines, mill machinery and farm utensils. The St.\r\nCroix Iron Works, Door, Sash and Blind Factory, established originally\r\nas a machine shop in 1865, on the river bank, near the Chicago & Omaha\r\nround house, has been owned by various parties. A foundry was added in\r\n1874, and in 1878 Isaac Staples added a sash and blind factory.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARRIAGE MANUFACTORIES.\r\n\r\nRichard Daw established the Novelty Carriage Works in 1875, one door\r\neast of the Sawyer House.\r\n\r\nD. J. Sullivan established the Stillwater Carriage Works in 1878, one\r\ndoor east of the Sawyer House, but afterward removed to a better\r\nlocation on Second street.\r\n\r\nWm. Miller erected the Pioneer Carriage Manufactory in 1866, on Main\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\nAlbert Saeker in 1872 established a wagon shop on Second street\r\nbetween Myrtle and Chestnut.\r\n\r\nFrederick Steinacker commenced the manufacture of brick in 1859, in a\r\nyard located in Ramsey & Carter's addition, but afterward removed to\r\nthe lower end of Sunfish lake.\r\n\r\nIt is claimed that Herman Tepass' brewery is the outgrowth of the\r\nfirst in the county, if not in the State, a still having been located\r\nat the corner of Third and Chestnut streets in 1851. The present site\r\nis on Lower Main street. Joseph Wolff's brewery is located on the\r\ncorner of Main and Nelson streets, and was established in 1868.\r\n\r\nHeitman & Becker established a bakery in 1879. Messrs. Muller Brothers\r\nestablished a boat factory in 1873. A vinegar factory was commenced by\r\nCiopac & Tuor in 1875, and is continued by the latter. Of the several\r\nlivery stables in Stillwater the first was established by C. A.\r\nBromley in 1853.\r\n\r\nThe Stillwater Building Association, organized under the laws of the\r\nState, March 23, 1887, has done much for the prosperity of the city,\r\naffording as it does to persons of limited capital an opportunity of\r\nbuilding suitable homes and business houses. Private enterprise has\r\ndone much in the erection of substantial blocks for business purposes.\r\nHenry Sawyer, in 1856, built the first stone block in the city. It is\r\nlocated on Main street. Other fine blocks were built by McComb,\r\nEldridge, Bernheimer, Elam Greely, Wm. Holcombe, Schlenk, L. E.\r\nTorinus, Hersey & Staples, McKusick, and others. Many of these blocks\r\nare fireproof and built of stone, and are fine specimens of\r\narchitecture, convenient and commodious.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHURCH SOCIETIES AND BUILDINGS.\r\n\r\nStillwater has sixteen church organizations and fifteen buildings, the\r\nlatter having a total valuation of $315,000.\r\n\r\nThe Ascension church (Episcopal) originated in the labors of Rev. E.\r\nA. Greenleaf, in 1846. The corner stone of the first building was laid\r\nin 1851. Rev. Joseph A. Russell was the first rector. In 1873 the\r\ncorner stone of the present edifice was laid by Bishop Welles of\r\nWisconsin. This building cost $10,000, and was burned in 1886 and\r\nrebuilt in 1887.\r\n\r\nThe First Presbyterian church grew out of the missionary labors of\r\nRev. W. T. Boutwell, in 1847 and 1848. The church was organized in\r\n1849; Rev. J. S. Whitney, pastor. The first building was erected in\r\n1851, and the second, the armory, in 1857. The present edifice,\r\nlocated on the corner of Myrtle and Third, was built in 1884, at a\r\ncost of $22,000, and the total value of building and ground is\r\n$30,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH\r\n\r\nDates its beginning from a society formed by Rev. James Harrington in\r\n1850. It was organized regularly in 1853 by Rev. T. M. Fullerton. The\r\nfirst house of worship was a small frame on Myrtle street, between\r\nSecond and Third streets. It was enlarged and improved in 1862. The\r\npresent edifice on Third street near Myrtle, with the parsonage\r\nadjoining, cost about $4,200. The church has a membership of two\r\nhundred.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. MICHAEL'S (CATHOLIC) CHURCH\r\n\r\nWas organized in 1853, the first services being held by Rev. Father\r\nPeyragrosse, a missionary. The first edifice was built on Fourth and\r\nMulberry streets, and Rev. Father Fisher was the first clergyman in\r\ncharge. The building was enlarged and improved in 1857. The present\r\ncommodious edifice was commenced in 1872 and dedicated in 1875. The\r\nchurch property, including the school parish buildings and cemetery of\r\ntwelve acres in South Stillwater, is worth $130,000. There are now two\r\nresident clergymen, Revs. Murphy and Gaughan.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. MARY'S (CATHOLIC) CHURCH,\r\n\r\nRev. P. Alphonse Krusle, pastor, was organized in 1865, and owns a\r\nchurch building on Fifth street, near Pine, valued at $25,000. The\r\ntotal value of church and parish buildings, and of the six lots on\r\nwhich they are located, amounts to $55,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNIVERSALIST CHURCH\r\n\r\nSociety was incorporated June 6, 1868, and the first preaching was by\r\nRev. E. A. Hodsdon, of St. Anthony. The edifice is on Third street\r\nSouth; cost about $15,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nSWEDISH LUTHERAN.\r\n\r\nThe society was organized in 1871; the church building was erected in\r\n1882-83, at a cost of $15,000. The pastor is Rev. A. F. Tornell.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST GERMAN LUTHERAN\r\n\r\nChurch was organized in 1871. The church building and parsonage are on\r\nThird street, near Olive, and are valued at $4,500. The pastor is Rev.\r\nJ. J. Weiss.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NORWEGIAN LUTHERAN\r\n\r\nSociety uses the German Lutheran church buildings, corner of Olive and\r\nFourth streets.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GERMAN METHODIST\r\n\r\nCongregation worships in a frame building, corner of Linden and\r\nEverett streets.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SALEM GERMAN LUTHERAN CHURCH\r\n\r\nWas formed by the withdrawal of a part of the members of the First\r\nGerman Lutheran church for separate worship. The Swedish church and\r\nschool, on the corner of Olive and Fourth streets, were purchased for\r\n$2,150. To this a parsonage was added at a cost of $2,150. Rev. L. F.\r\nFrey is the pastor.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DANISH LUTHERAN CHURCH\r\n\r\nHas a cosy frame edifice on Laurel, between Williams and Owen, but is\r\nnot holding services at present. The edifice cost $7,000 and the\r\nmembership is one hundred and fifty.\r\n\r\n\r\nSWEDISH CONGREGATIONAL.\r\n\r\nThe Swedish Congregational church occupies a frame building on Fourth\r\nstreet, between Hickory and Elm streets, which cost $2,000 and has\r\nsixty members.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ST. JOSEPH'S (CATHOLIC) CHURCH\r\n\r\nWas organized by the present pastor, Rev. Father E. Roe, in 1882, with\r\nseventeen members, which has since been increased to eighty families.\r\nA frame edifice was erected in 1884, with a seating capacity of four\r\nhundred, costing about $8,000, corner of Olive and Greely streets. The\r\nchurch property consists of the edifice and the priest's house, and\r\ncost $11,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SWEDISH METHODIST CHURCH\r\n\r\nWas organized in 1880 by Rev. C. S. Carlander. The church building is\r\nlocated on Myrtle and Fourth streets, and cost $2,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG MEN'S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION\r\n\r\nHas a membership of seventy-five and a frame building erected in 1872\r\nat a cost of $1,200.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLIC BUILDINGS.\r\n\r\nThe court house and other public buildings of the city are creditable\r\nspecimens of architecture, rooms convenient and well adapted to the\r\npurposes of their construction. The present court house building is\r\nthe third erected. Its cost, including that of the jail buildings, the\r\nwall around them and other improvements, has been something over\r\n$75,000. The city hall, at the corner of Myrtle and Third streets, is\r\na substantial and convenient building. It contains also room for the\r\ncity officers. The public school buildings have kept pace with the\r\ngrowth of the city. In the summer of 1887 the city erected a high\r\nschool building at a cost of $60,000. The engine house is a good\r\nbuilding, centrally located. An elegant union depot was built in 1887,\r\nof brown stone from the Apostle islands, at a cost of $30,000.\r\n\r\nTHE OPERA HOUSE.--The opera house occupies the site of the old Lake\r\nHouse, on Main street between Nelson and Chestnut streets. It was\r\ncommenced in 1880 and finished in 1881, under the supervision of L.\r\nW. Eldred, architect. Its size is 90×120 feet, ground plan, and four\r\nstories in height, or seventy-one feet from lower floor to cornice.\r\nThe style of architecture is a blending of the Queen Anne, Victoria\r\nand Gothic. The entrance to the upper part of the building is by a\r\nstairway twelve feet wide, in a lofty, ornamental turret. The\r\nauditorium is 64×120 feet, and beautifully and elaborately finished\r\nand furnished, and is capable of seating over 1,200 persons. It is\r\nwell lighted, being supplied with 130 gas jets, warmed by steam, and\r\nwell ventilated. The stage is 39×64 feet, complete in all its\r\nappointments, and supplied with all the necessary stage scenery,\r\nwings, border bridge, balcony, interior and other decorations. The\r\nceiling of the auditorium is superbly frescoed and the cornice is\r\nadorned with medallions of Shakespeare, Haydn, Schiller, Goethe,\r\nDickens, Handel, Scott, Longfellow, Mozart, Tennyson, and Beethoven.\r\nThe parts of the building not occupied for stage purposes are\r\nappropriated to halls, offices and stores.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOCIETIES AND ASSOCIATIONS.\r\n\r\nI. O. O. F.--Lodge No. 1, organized June, 1849; Stillwater Lodge, No.\r\n51, organized January, 1876.\r\n\r\nMasonic.--St. John's Lodge No. 1, organized 1849; Washington, Royal\r\nArch Chapter, No. 17, organized March, 1868; Bayard Commandery, K.

A. R., Stillwater Post, No. 13, organized March, 1868.\r\n\r\n\r\nCEMETERIES.\r\n\r\nThe first burial ground was selected in 1846. Ten years later, by a\r\nsurvey of the city, these grounds were included in what is now known\r\nas block 3. These grounds were used until the organization of the\r\nFairview Cemetery Association in 1867, when the bodies were removed to\r\nthe new cemetery in the burial ground in South Stillwater. Fairview\r\ncemetery is beautifully located on undulating or hilly ground and is\r\nadorned with shrubbery and made attractive by the hand of art. Its\r\nlocation is within the city limits, near the corner of Orleans and\r\nFourth streets.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON COUNTY AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY.\r\n\r\nAn attempt was made at organization in 1856, but it proved premature.\r\nThe present society was organized in February, 1871, at Cottage Grove,\r\nand incorporated the same year. The first board of officers consisted\r\nof J. W. Furber, president; J. S. Norris, vice president; T. Elwell,\r\nsecretary, and James Middleton, treasurer. In 1873 the fair grounds\r\nwere established near Stillwater, under the joint control of the\r\nAgricultural Society and the Driving Park Association. In 1875 the\r\nfair grounds were established at Lake Elmo. But one fair had been held\r\nthere when a cyclone struck the grounds and swept away all the\r\nimprovements. The society again effected an arrangement by which their\r\nfairs were held on the grounds near Stillwater.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINNESOTA STATE PRISON.\r\n\r\nAt the organization of Minnesota Territory Congress appropriated\r\n$5,000 for a territorial prison. The legislature expended the money\r\nthus appropriated in building a prison at Stillwater. The site was\r\nlocated by a commission appointed by the legislature in 1849,\r\nconsisting of John McKusick, E. A. C. Hatch and Lewis Robert. The\r\ncommission was also authorized to locate the Territorial University\r\nand select a site in St. Paul for the capitol. Their task was not\r\ncompleted until the ensuing year. Their selection of a location for\r\nthe university and of a site for the capitol were satisfactory, but it\r\nwas generally conceded that the site for the prison was badly chosen.\r\nThe ground, nine acres, was mostly quagmire, and was, moreover,\r\ncrowded in a ravine between high bluffs. However, it was convenient to\r\nthe lake and steamboat landing, and was well watered with pure spring\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nIn 1851 Jesse Taylor, F. R. Delano, Martin Mower, J. E. McKusick, and\r\nJacob Fisher entered into contract with the commissioners, under the\r\nfirm name of Jesse Taylor & Co., to build one stone wing of the prison\r\nbuilding, to be inclosed with a stone wall. The dimensions of the wing\r\nwere 30 × 40 feet and three stories high. In 1853 an addition was\r\nbuilt, and Francis R. Delano was appointed warden. Until 1858 the\r\nexpenditure of the public money used in building and other expenses\r\nwas under the control of the warden. Under state rule the warden was\r\nrelieved of this burden of responsibility. The legislature had\r\nprovided that prisoners might be received in the penitentiary not yet\r\nconvicted of crime, on condition that their board should be defrayed\r\nby the counties from which they were sent. When this expense was not\r\npromptly met by the counties the prisoners thus held were set at\r\nliberty. The Washington county grand jury investigated the matter and\r\nmemorialized the ensuing legislature, which effected a change in the\r\nlaws regarding such commitments. Wings were added to the prison, walls\r\nwere built, shops and other accessories added from year to year, and\r\nappropriations were made from time to time. In 1870 an appropriation\r\nof $74,000 was made for extending the building. Outside companies were\r\npermitted to build shops and manufactories within the prison limits\r\nthat they might avail themselves of convict labor.\r\n\r\nThe following are the wardens who have served since the prison was\r\nbuilt: Territorial, F. R. Delano; state government: Francis O. J.\r\nSmith, appointed March 4, 1858; Henry N. Setzer, Aug. 4, 1858; John S.\r\nProctor, Jan. 1, 1860; Joshua L. Taylor, Feb. 16, 1868; A. C. Webber,\r\nMarch 16, 1870; Henry A. Jackman, Oct. 10, 1870; John A. Reid, Aug. 3,\r\n1874; H. G. Stordock, 1887.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the number of convicts each year up to the\r\npresent time:\r\n\r\n    1853                0\r\n    1854                2\r\n    1855                8\r\n    1856                1\r\n    1857                0\r\n    1858                2\r\n    1839                5\r\n    1860               16\r\n    1861               12\r\n    1862                7\r\n    1963                8\r\n    1864                7\r\n    1865               11\r\n    1866               29\r\n    1867               36\r\n    1868               31\r\n    1869               47\r\n    1870               39\r\n    1871               60\r\n    1872               59\r\n    1873               64\r\n    1875               93\r\n    1876               90\r\n    1877              145\r\n    1878              218\r\n    1879              254\r\n    1880              254\r\n    1881              247\r\n    1882              279\r\n    1883              301\r\n    1884              356\r\n    1885              395\r\n    1886, Mar. 31     416\r\n\r\nThe prison on the whole has been well and humanely managed. There have\r\nbeen occasional outbreaks, easily suppressed, or cases of individual\r\ninsubordination, two or three with fatal results to the\r\ninsubordinates.\r\n\r\nThe prison buildings have been several times visited by damaging and\r\ndisastrous fires. The most serious were in 1884. The first occurred\r\nJanuary 8th, by which the large workshop and machinery owned by the\r\nState and the Northwestern Car Company were destroyed. The second\r\noccurred January 26th, and destroyed the main prison buildings,\r\nincluding the cells, from which the prisoners were rescued with the\r\ngreatest difficulty. One perished of suffocation. On this occasion\r\nguards, prison officials and some of the convicts displayed heroism\r\nworthy of the highest commendation. The convicts on the whole behaved\r\nwell. Mr. Reid, the warden of the prison, behaved with great coolness\r\nand decision, and so averted what might have been a fearful disaster.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRES.\r\n\r\nStillwater has suffered occasionally from fires. The first house\r\nburned was the McKusick boarding house, in 1846. The Northrup hotel\r\nwas burned in 1847. In 1866 a fire occurred on the west side of Main\r\nstreet, between Myrtle and Chestnut, in which twelve buildings were\r\nburned, principally frame structures. In 1872 the Lake House and four\r\nadjacent buildings were burned. The Schulenburg mill was burned in\r\n1878. Two great fires occurred in the penitentiary in 1884. The\r\nEpiscopal church building and the mills of Hersey & Bean were burned\r\nin 1887. Numerous smaller fires occurred at intervals, but owing to\r\nthe efficiency of the fire companies they were easily suppressed.\r\n\r\n\r\nBONDS AND INDEBTEDNESS.\r\n\r\nUp to 1886 the bonded indebtedness of the city has aggregated the sum\r\nof $345,000. The bonds were issued at various times for railway and\r\nlevee improvements, city bridge, city buildings, water works and\r\ncurrent funds. The interest on these bonds has always been promptly\r\nmet, and the expenditures for improvements have been more than repaid\r\nto the taxpayers by the increased valuation of property within the\r\ncity limits.\r\n\r\nISSAC STAPLES, son of Rev. Winslow Staples, was born in Topsham,\r\nMaine, Sept. 25, 1816. At eighteen years of age he bought his time of\r\nhis father for three hundred and sixty dollars. He found employment on\r\nthe Penobscot river at lumbering for two years, when he engaged in\r\nselling goods at Old Town, but soon after went into the lumbering\r\nbusiness with S.F. Hersey. In 1849 Mr. Staples was appointed agent for\r\nthe Penobscot Indians living at Old Town, twelve miles above Bangor,\r\non the Penobscot. In October, 1853, Mr. Staples came to Minnesota for\r\nthe purpose of purchasing pine lands, and located at Stillwater,\r\nmoving his family here in 1854. Mr. Staples represented a wealthy\r\ncompany, composed of himself, S. F. Hersey and some Massachusetts men,\r\nwho furnished all the money needed to buy pine land or make any other\r\ninvestments deemed advisable. They, through the agency of Mr. Staples,\r\npurchased immense quantities of pine timber. They built a large saw\r\nmill in Stillwater, and dealt in any and all branches of business\r\nconsidered remunerative. The advent of Isaac Staples in Stillwater\r\ngave to the city new life. Mr. Staples was indefatigable in his\r\nlabors, full of vigor and in prime health. His ambition was unlimited,\r\nhis judgment good. Backed up by a successful lumbering experience in\r\nMaine, and with money sufficient to meet all necessary calls, he was\r\nfinancially progressive and prosperous. In after years Messrs. Staples\r\n& Hersey purchased the entire interest of the firm of Hersey, Staples\r\n& Co. Subsequently the firm changed to Hersey & Staples and Hersey,\r\nStaples & Bean, and finally a division of property was agreed upon.\r\nSince the division Mr. Staples has been just as extensively engaged in\r\nthe name of Isaac Staples in doing business as at any period in his\r\npast life.\r\n\r\nIn 1887 Mr. Staples purchased the property of the Cushing Company,\r\nlocated at St. Croix and Taylor's Falls, for $50,000. This property\r\nhas long been in litigation and consequently has been unimproved. The\r\nadvent of Mr. Staples, as proprietor, opens a new era in the history\r\nof the two villages at the head of navigation on the St. Croix.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his lumbering and real estate interests, Mr. Staples\r\nhas also engaged in farming and stock raising on an extensive scale.\r\nHe owns one farm of six hundred and forty acres within the limits of\r\nStillwater. This farm is well stocked and supplied with stores, barns,\r\nshops and other buildings. It is used as a stork farm, and as a\r\nheadquarters for supplying his lumbering camps.\r\n\r\nMr. Staples has another farm located on the line of the Minneapolis,\r\nSoo & Atlantic railway, eleven miles northwest of Stillwater, known as\r\nthe Maple Island farm, which contains 1,400 acres of land, inclosed\r\nand supplied with barns, farm houses and other buildings. There are\r\nfine wells and lakes and some well stocked fish ponds. He owns a\r\nflouring mill on this farm.\r\n\r\nMr. Staples has a third farm at Bronson, Kanabec county, containing\r\n2,000 acres of land, well under cultivation. Ann river flows through\r\nthis farm, and is supplied with a dam to facilitate the driving of\r\nlogs into Fish lake. The farm is also made a fitting-out place for the\r\nlumbering camps. These three farms are valued at $250,000.\r\n\r\nMr. Staples has lived an unusually busy life, and has been unusually\r\nsuccessful. Though past the ordinary limit of human life, he is still\r\nactive, and will probably continue to plan and work as long as he\r\nlives. He is happiest when most busily employed. His mind is of the\r\nactive type. He is restless, alert, far-seeing, systematic, and\r\npersistent. Without these qualities he never could have achieved the\r\nsuccess that has crowned his career. He has been twice married; first\r\nin 1839, to Miss Caroline B. Rogers, of Old Town, Maine, by whom he\r\nhad one child, who is still living. Mrs. Staples died in 1810. He was\r\nagain married, Jan, 31, 1841, to Miss Olivia J. Pettengill, of Old\r\nTown, Maine, by whom he has had eight children,--four sons and four\r\ndaughters,--four of whom are living.\r\n\r\nSAMUEL F. HERSEY, of the late firm of Hersey, Staples & Co., was born\r\nin Sumner, Maine, in 1812. At an early day he became a citizen of\r\nBangor, Maine, and wisely invested in pine timber lands on the\r\nPenobscot waters, when lands were cheap. Their true value was not\r\nappreciated by many. The business interests of the county had not been\r\ndeveloped and lumber dealing was not profitable. The increase in value\r\non his investments made him a wealthy man. He was a banker, merchant\r\nand lumberman. His investments always yielded a rich return. His\r\nassociates and townsmen often elected him to posts of honor and trust.\r\nIn 1842-57-65-67 and 69 he was in the Maine state legislature.

He is of French\r\ndescent, and some of his ancestors took part in the Revolutionary War.\r\nHe was born in 1827, and came to Stillwater in 1850, where he engaged\r\nactively in business, dealing in lumber and pine lands, piloting,\r\nsteamboating and farming. He was at one time a member of the city\r\ncouncil, and a representative in the territorial legislature of\r\n1854-5. He was married to Minerva Causlin in 1856.\r\n\r\nJ. A. JOHNSON was born near the city of Wexio, Sweden, April 24, 1842.\r\nIn 1854 he emigrated with his parents to the United States, arriving\r\nat Marine Mills, Washington county, Minnesota late in the fall of that\r\nyear. He remained at Marine and Stillwater till 1858, attending school\r\na large portion of the time. In the fall of that year he went to\r\nschool at Dubuque, Iowa. After completing the course of study he\r\nlearned the trade of locomotive engineer, which occupation he followed\r\ntill 1866, being in the employ of the United States government the\r\nlast years of the war, in Alabama, Georgia and Tennessee. After the\r\nclose of the war, in 1865, he returned north as far as St. Louis,\r\nMissouri, where he married Miss Agnes A. Coler, of that city. He has 5\r\nchildren, 3 boys and 2 girls. His health having been impaired in the\r\ngovernment service, he returned to Marine in 1866, where he remained\r\ntill Jan. 1, 1874. In the fall of 1873 he was elected to the office of\r\nsheriff of Washington county, which position he held for six years,\r\nand has been twice re-elected without opposition. Retiring from the\r\nsheriff's office in 1880, he removed to Fargo, Dakota, and engaged in\r\nthe sale of agricultural implements, in which business he has remained\r\nup to the present time.\r\n\r\nDuring his residence in the city of Fargo he has held various offices,\r\nsuch as alderman, member of the board of education, etc. In the fall\r\nof 1884 he was nominated for the territorial senate and received a\r\nmajority of 1,133 votes in Cass county, and 835 out of a total of\r\n1,669 in the city of Fargo. In the spring of 1885 he was elected\r\nmayor of Fargo by over 300 majority, after one of the most hotly\r\ncontested campaigns in the political history of the city. In 1886 he\r\ndeclined a re-election. While sheriff of Washington county he devoted\r\nhis leisure moments to the study of law, and was admitted to practice\r\nin all the courts of Minnesota. Although not in active practice his\r\nknowledge of law has been of great value to him in the business in\r\nwhich he has been engaged since that time.\r\n\r\nGOLD T. CURTIS was born in Morrisville, New York, Aug. 16, 1821. At\r\nthe age of eighteen he graduated at Hamilton College, New York, and\r\nentered upon the study of law with Judge Morrill, Chenango county, New\r\nYork. He commenced practicing law at Belleville, New York, in 1850.\r\nDuring the same year he was married to Abigail Anderson, a descendant\r\nof Gen. John Stark, of Revolutionary fame, and of the Protestant\r\nbranch of the royal house of the Stuarts, some of whom came from\r\nScotland to America in 1742. Mrs. Curtis is a lineal descendant of the\r\nunfortunate Mary, Queen of Scots. Mr. Curtis removed to Stillwater in\r\n1854 and entered upon a lucrative law practice. He was elected a\r\nmember of the Minnesota constitutional convention. In 1857 he was also\r\nnominated for the position of district judge, but was defeated by S.\r\nJ. R. McMillan. He was much respected and held some offices of trust\r\nin the city and county. At the breaking out of the Rebellion he\r\nenlisted in Company I, Fifth Minnesota, and was promoted to the\r\ncaptaincy of the company, but his health failed and he died in St.\r\nLouis July 24, 1862. His remains were brought to Stillwater and\r\ninterred with military and masonic honors, Aug. 2, 1862.\r\n\r\nHARLEY D. CURTIS, a native of New York and a brother of Gold T.\r\nCurtis, came to Stillwater in 1851. He held the positions of\r\npostmaster and justice of the peace.\r\n\r\nFRANCIS ROACH DELANO.--The ancestors of Mr. Delano came to America in\r\n1621, and were active participants in the stirring scenes and\r\ncontroversies preceding the Revolution. Francis Roach, after whom Mr.\r\nDelano was named, was the owner of the ship Dartmouth, one of the\r\nvessels out of which the tea was cast into Boston harbor, on the\r\nmemorable occasion of the Tea Party of 1774. Notwithstanding the\r\naffair of the tea, the family, who were ardent patriots, have\r\npreserved as a precious relic some of the tea rescued from the general\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nMr. Delano is one of sixteen children in his father's family. He was\r\nborn in Worcester, Massachusetts, Nov. 20, 1823; received a common\r\nschool and academic education, and was employed in a machine shop some\r\nyears. At the age of twenty he was employed in an engineering corps\r\nand served two years. He was for two years superintendent of the\r\nBoston & Worcester railroad. In 1844 he came to St. Louis, Missouri,\r\nand was variously employed until 1848, when he removed to Minnesota\r\nand was engaged for a year in St. Anthony (now Minneapolis), in\r\nrunning the government mill. The mill had been leased for five years.\r\nMr. Smith fulfilled the contract, and Mr. Delano, being released from\r\nit, came to Stillwater in 1851 and entered into contract with Jesse\r\nTaylor, Martin Mower, Jonathan E. McKusick, and Jacob Fisher, under\r\nthe firm name of Jesse Taylor & Co., to build the territorial prison.\r\nMr. Delano was appointed first warden, March, 1853, and served until\r\n1858. He was intrusted with the expenditure of public moneys from\r\nterritorial authorities, in caring for and improving the prison. When\r\nthe state government was organized he was released. He was afterward a\r\nmember of the firm of Delano, McKusick & Co., sawing and selling\r\nlumber. J. E. McKusick and Robert Simpson were members of this firm.\r\nMr. Delano moved to St. Paul in 1862, and was afterward engaged in\r\nrailroad employment. In 1862 he was commissioned colonel to take\r\ncommand of five companies during the Indian outbreak. The command was\r\nstationed at Chengwatana, Pine county. He died February, 1887. He was\r\nmarried Oct. 11, 1846, to Calista Ann Cavander, who, with two sons,\r\nsurvives him.\r\n\r\nHENRY W. CANNON was born in Delhi, New York, Sept. 25, 1852. He was\r\neducated at Delaware Literary Institute. He came to St. Paul in 1870,\r\nand in 1871 to Stillwater, where he accepted the position of cashier\r\nof the Stillwater Lumberman's Bank. In 1882 he was appointed by\r\nPresident Arthur United States bank comptroller. He was removed by\r\nPresident Cleveland. He is now a resident of New York City, and is\r\nengaged in banking.\r\n\r\nDWIGHT M. SABIN was born at Marseilles, La Salle county, Illinois,\r\nApril 25, 1843. The ill health of the father, who was an extensive\r\nland owner and stock raiser, necessitated a removal to the seaside in\r\nConnecticut in 1856. In consequence of the continued ill health of\r\nthe father and his death in 1864, young Dwight was deprived of the\r\nthorough education to which he aspired, and, being the oldest son,\r\nfound the cares and responsibilities of managing his father's business\r\nthrown upon his shoulders while he was yet a boy. In 1867 he removed\r\nwith his mother and younger brother to Minnesota, the year following\r\nto Stillwater, where he engaged in business with the firm of Seymour,\r\nSabin & Co. This firm contracted for the convict labor in the state\r\nprison, and engaged in the manufacture of doors, sash, blinds and\r\ncooperage. The business in 1874 was extended and made to include the\r\nmanufacture of agricultural implements, including also a machine,\r\nboiler shop and foundry, until it is now one of the most extensive\r\nestablishments in the country.\r\n\r\nMr. Sabin is also interested in other manufactures, among them the C.\r\nN. Nelson Lumber Company and the Duluth Iron Company. In 1882 Mr.\r\nSabin was the prime organizer of the Northwestern Car Company, with a\r\ncapital of $5,000,000. The company was to receive a bonus from the\r\ncity of Stillwater of $100,000 in bonds, on certain conditions. The\r\ncompany purchased the interests of Seymour, Sabin & Co., thereby\r\ncoming into possession of their immense manufactories, including those\r\nmanaged under the prison contracts, and elected Mr. Sabin president,\r\nand was making rapid progress toward the completion of its plans,\r\nwhen, owing to the stringency of the financial world, it was compelled\r\nto make an assignment.\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. Sabin has been busy with the management of his vast\r\nmanufacturing establishments, he has been no less active and\r\nconspicuous as a public spirited citizen, ever taking a great interest\r\nin the affairs of his adopted city, of the State and country at large,\r\nand his talents and efficiency have been recognized by his fellow\r\ncitizens, who elected him to the state senate in 1871-72-73, and to\r\nthe house of representatives in 1878 and 1881. He has several times\r\nbeen a delegate to the National Republican convention, and was\r\nchairman of the convention at which James G. Blaine was nominated for\r\nthe presidency. He was elected to the United States senate in 1883 as\r\nthe successor of Hon. Wm. Windom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nSTEARNS, ANOKA AND SHERBURNE COUNTIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEARNS COUNTY.\r\n\r\nStearns county derived its name from Hon. Charles T. Stearns, a\r\nprominent citizen of St. Cloud, a representative of the precinct of\r\nSt. Anthony Falls in the fifth and sixth territorial councils.\r\n\r\nIt is bounded on the north by Todd and Morrison counties, on the east\r\nby Benton, Sherburne and Wright counties, the Mississippi forming the\r\ndividing line against Benton and Sherburne, and Clearwater against\r\nWright county, on the south by Kandiyohi and Mecker, and on the west\r\nby Pope county. It contains an area equal to thirty-six townships. It\r\nis a fine agricultural county and is well watered by the tributaries\r\nof the Mississippi, the principal of which is Sauk river. It has also\r\nan abundance of small lakes. Its oldest settlement and principal city\r\nis St. Cloud, and among its most flourishing villages are Sauk Centre,\r\nFair Haven, Clearwater, Melrose, St. Joseph, Albany, Paynesville,\r\nRichmond, and Cold Springs.\r\n\r\nThe county was organized in 1855, under the legislative act of that\r\nyear. Gov. Willis A. Gorman appointed the following commissioners:\r\nDavid T. Wood, John Ferschniller and John L. Wilson. They held their\r\nfirst meeting at the house of John L. Wilson, April 9, 1855. J. L.\r\nWilson acted as chairman. The board appointed the following county\r\nofficers: Charles Ketchum, clerk; Robert B. Blake, treasurer; L. B.\r\nHammond, sheriff; N. N. Smith, judge of probate; R. B. Blake,\r\nsurveyor; and John Harry Weltshimer, assessor. The board established\r\nthree precincts, viz.: St. Augusta, St. Cloud and Tamarack. The judges\r\nof election for St. Augusta were John M. Feble, John G. Lodenbeck and\r\nAnton Emholt; for St. Cloud, Joseph Demil, L. B. Hammond and Battise\r\nArsenan; for Tamarack, Henry Foster, Louis Amel and John Smith.\r\nLicense was granted to Joseph P. Wilson, George F. Brott, L. B.\r\nHammond, and O. Carter to run a ferry across the Mississippi river.\r\nApril 30, 1855, Farmington precinct was established. John M. Lindeman,\r\nJacob C. Staples and D. T. Wood were judges of election. July 5, 1855,\r\nthe first rate of taxation was fixed for the county at one per cent.\r\n\r\nThe first license to sell spirituous liquors was granted to Anton\r\nEdelbrock. The first order issued was to pay for county books, $31.86,\r\nto John L. Wilson. Ordered that Washington avenue and St. Augusta\r\nstreet be adopted as county roads. Aug. 27, 1855, it was ordered that\r\nChippewa Agency precinct (now in Crow Wing county) be and remain as it\r\nwas when a part of Benton county, and J. D. Crittenden, Truman Warren\r\nand D. B. Herriman were appointed judges of election. It was ordered\r\nthat Long Prairie precinct (now in Todd county) remain as it was when\r\na part of Benton county, and Anson Northrup, Lewis Stone and Harman\r\nBecker were appointed judges of election. On Jan. 6, 1856, a new board\r\nof commissioners qualified, consisting of Anton Edelbrock, chairman,\r\nReuben M. Richardson, and M. J. Orth. H. C. Waite was appointed\r\nprosecuting attorney. The county was organized for judicial purposes\r\nin 1855, and the counties of Crow Wing and Todd were attached. The\r\nfirst term of court was held June 25, 1855; Hon. Moses Sherburne,\r\npresiding, Taylor Dudley, clerk, and Joseph Edelbrock, sheriff. The\r\nwriter is indebted to the efficient clerk of court of 1887, A. L.\r\nCramb, for collecting data, as the old records are quite\r\nunintelligible.\r\n\r\nJudge E. O. Hamlin held the first term of court under the state\r\norganization. At the session of the commissioners in July, 1856, the\r\nfirst bonds of the county were ordered for building a court house,\r\namounting to $7,000, at twelve per cent interest for eight years. The\r\nbonds were offered in New York City by an agent. These bonds were\r\nlost, and only two of them were recovered. At the session of the\r\ncommissioners for August, the donation of John L. Wilson of four\r\nblocks of ground, containing eight acres, for court house purposes,\r\nwas accepted. Three-fourths of the ground was sold by the county, and\r\nthe funds received from the sale, together with $6,000 in bonds issued\r\nin 1857, and other bonds issued later, were used in erecting the\r\ncourt house.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. CLOUD.\r\n\r\nThe eastern side of the Mississippi river was the first settled. As\r\nearly as 1848 David Gilman had located at a point now called Watab.\r\nDuring the ensuing year, Jeremiah Russell, Philip Beaupre and James\r\nBeatty were keeping trading posts at Sauk Rapids. In 1849 J. Q. A. and\r\nW. H. Wood, brothers, located there. In 1854 the Rapids had become\r\nquite a point with its Indian trading posts, its stores and its United\r\nStates land office. Among the early residents were many subsequently\r\nidentified with the interests of St. Cloud. In the spring of 1854 John\r\nL. Wilson crossed the river at the point now known as the upper\r\nlanding, then covered with a dense growth of trees and underbrush. On\r\nthe adjoining prairie, a Norwegian, Ole Burgerson by name, had staked\r\nout a claim and put up a shanty. Mr. Wilson purchased his interest and\r\nin June of the same year erected a frame dwelling (still standing)\r\nnear the railroad bridge. Nicholas Lake put up a blacksmith shop near\r\nby. During this year James Hitchins put up a small log dwelling for\r\nGen. S. B. Lowry, who platted the township of Acadia, now Lowry's\r\naddition to St. Cloud. A post office was established here through his\r\ninfluence. The same year Brott & Co. laid out St. Cloud city. The\r\nearliest claimants of the town site, owning claims fronting on the\r\nriver, were S. B. Lowry, Ole Burgerson, Martin Woolley, and Michael\r\nZoms. John L. Wilson having purchased the claim of Ole Burgerson,\r\nplatted the village of St. Cloud, and this was the first recorded of\r\nany of the St. Cloud plats. The village of St. Cloud made but little\r\nprogress until 1856, when a hotel known as the Stearns House, now used\r\nin connection with the normal school, was built, a ferry established\r\nand other improvements made. A notable incident connected with this\r\nferry is the fact that the Rev. Abbot Alexius Edelbrock, now president\r\nof St. John's University, then a lad of thirteen years of age, was\r\nferryman, he being the son of the proprietor of the ferry. The craft\r\nwas swung back and forth like a pendulum, by the current acting\r\nagainst its keel, being fastened by a long rope some distance up the\r\nriver. It was not therefore beyond the ability of so youthful a\r\nferryman to manage. The post office, established first at Acadia,\r\nbecame the St. Cloud post office and Joseph Edelbrock was appointed\r\npostmaster. He was reappointed by President Cleveland to the same\r\nposition in 1886. The first newspaper in St. Cloud was the _Visitor_,\r\nestablished in 1857, by the gifted and somewhat erratic journalist and\r\nreformer, Jane Grey Swisshelm. This paper had but a brief and troubled\r\ncareer--the advanced views and dictatorial style of its publisher and\r\neditor proving somewhat distasteful to the community at large. Mrs.\r\nSwisshelm, who had already won a national reputation, went to\r\nWashington, became a contributor to the New York _Tribune_, and had\r\nthereafter a somewhat variable, and upon the whole brilliant, career\r\nas a lecturer, editor and reformer. She was amongst the strongest,\r\nthough not the most radical, of the advocates of woman's rights. She\r\nwas not a woman suffragist, but directed her efforts chiefly toward\r\nestablishing the legal identity of married women. She was also very\r\npronounced in her anti-slavery views.\r\n\r\nThe first records of the organization of St. Cloud as a village have\r\nbeen lost. It was reorganized by legislative enactment in 1862, and\r\nthe following were the first officers: Mayor, Judge L. A. Evans;\r\ncouncilmen, H. C. Burbank, John W. Tenvoorde, Joseph Broker and Barney\r\nOverbeck; clerk, A. B. Curry.\r\n\r\nSt. Cloud was organized as a city in 1868, under the following\r\nofficers: Mayor, Judge E. O. Hamlin; aldermen, L. A. Evans, president;\r\nPeter Smith, Thomas Smith, T. C. Alden, Leander Gorton, T. R. Bennett,\r\nO. Tenny, C. Bridgman, Andrew Fritz, L. R. Roberts, Lewis Clarke, H.\r\nC. Burbank; clerk, N. F. Barnes. The city government has been\r\njudiciously managed. The United States land office, established first\r\nat Sauk Rapids in 1853, was removed to St. Cloud in May, 1858. The\r\nfirst receiver was W. H. Wood. His successors have been S. B. Hayes,\r\nC. A. Gilman, W. B. Mitchell, H. G. Burbank, Ole Peterson, and C. F.\r\nMcDonald, the present incumbent. The first register was George W.\r\nSweet. His successors have been W. A. Caruthers, T. C. McClure, H. C.\r\nWaite, H. L. Gordon, J. A. Brower, and D. H. Freeman.\r\n\r\nThe city has paid for various improvements as follows: City water\r\nworks on the Holly system, $25,000; city bridge over the Mississippi,\r\n500 feet in length, $12,000; to the Manitoba railroad in real estate\r\nand bonds, $100,000; in cash, $27,000; gas works, $10,000. The fire\r\ndepartment is well equipped. An electric light plant has been\r\nestablished. Considerable money and work have been expended in\r\ndredging Lake George, a beautiful lake about fifty-five acres in\r\nextent, lying in the heart of the city, and surrounding it with parks.\r\nStreet cars have been introduced and altogether the city has made most\r\ncommendable advancement in all those things that pertain to beauty and\r\ncomfort.\r\n\r\nNot less rapid and substantial are its advances in commerce and\r\nmanufactures. Before the completion of the railway it had regular\r\ncommunication by water with all river points, and since its facilities\r\nfor transportation have made it the peer of any inland city of its\r\nsize in the State. The railroads of St. Cloud are the Manitoba with\r\nits various branches and the Northern Pacific, the latter passing\r\nthrough East St. Cloud. Among the improvements of which its citizens\r\nare justly proud we may mention the St. Cloud dam, constructed in\r\n1886, at a cost of $200,000. The city gave $100,000 for this\r\nimprovement. The dam has for its foundation the underlying granite of\r\nthis section. It is intended as a permanent structure and must conduce\r\nlargely to the growth and prosperity of the city. The dam has 10 feet\r\nhead of water and furnishes 1,500 horse power. A flour mill with a\r\ncapacity of 300 barrels per day is run by the water power. The\r\nPhoenix Iron Works, established at a cost of $175,000, give\r\nemployment to 100 men. Bridgman's steam saw mill has a capacity of\r\nabout 40,000 feet of lumber per day.\r\n\r\nSt. Cloud is backed by a rich agricultural and timbered district. In\r\nthe vicinity are valuable quarries of jasper, and of gray and red\r\ngranite. Two granite polishing works, operated by steam, are located\r\nnear the city. These quarries stretch away to the northeast, through\r\nthe counties of Benton, Morrison, Mille Lacs and Kanabec. They give\r\nemployment to 1,000 men. The Manitoba Railroad Company has purchased\r\nrecently about 400 acres of land, on which to build extensive shops\r\nand stock yards, calculated to give employment, when completed, to\r\n1,000 men. The principal hotels are the Grand Central and the West\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nThe first bank in St. Cloud was established by Waite & McClure in\r\n1859. This bank, a private institution, was the beginning of the\r\nbanking system in St. Cloud. It is now operated by N. P. Clarke. The\r\nFirst National Bank was organized as a private bank in 1867, with a\r\ncapital stock of $25,000; James A. Bell, president; Joseph G. Smith,\r\ncashier. It was reorganized as a state bank in 1879, with a capital\r\nstock of $50,000. In 1886 it was reorganized as a national bank. The\r\nfirst board of officers have served continuously to date. The business\r\nof the bank amounts to over $300,000. The German American National\r\nBank was organized in 1883; Chas. A. Hull, president; Edgar Hull,\r\ncashier; capital stock $50,000. The business (in 1886) amounts to\r\n$250,000. The present board of officers are: F. E. Searle, president;\r\nJohn Cooper, vice president; F. M. Morgan, cashier.\r\n\r\nSt. Cloud has many fine buildings. The court house cost $40,000, and\r\nfour school buildings an aggregate of $75,000. The bishop's cathedral\r\ncost $40,000, and the Catholic church $30,000. The Episcopalians,\r\nPresbyterians, Baptists, Methodists, Congregationalists, and Lutherans\r\nhave organizations and good church buildings. The normal school\r\nbuildings located here cost $100,000. St. Cloud University is a\r\nflourishing institution. St. John's University, although located in\r\nthe adjoining town of St. Joseph, has been identified more or less\r\nwith the interests of St. Cloud, and deserves mention in its history.\r\nIt was originally located two miles south of St. Cloud, but was\r\nsubsequently removed to a point northwest, a mile distant from the\r\nthriving village of Collegeville.\r\n\r\nThe university owes its existence to the zeal, energy and self\r\ndevotion of the Benedictine Fathers, a colony of whom came to America\r\nin 1846. This colony settled first in Westmoreland, Pennsylvania, but\r\nin 1856, at the invitation of Bishop Cretin, came to Minnesota, where,\r\nthe year following, they commenced their educational work on the banks\r\nof the Mississippi near St. Cloud. The school was commenced as a\r\nseminary, but in 1869 the state legislature granted authority to\r\nconfer degrees, and in 1883 formally changed the name from St. John's\r\nSeminary to St. John's University. The buildings are ample and\r\ncommodious, and located pleasantly on the banks of a beautiful lake.\r\nThe faculty consists of Rt. Rev. Alexius Edelbrock and twenty-two\r\nprofessors. In 1885 St. Benedict's Hospital was erected at a cost of\r\nabout $15,000. It is under the supervision of the Benedictine Nuns.\r\nThe state reformatory was located at East St. Cloud in 1887.\r\n\r\n\r\nLA SAUK,\r\n\r\nFormerly St. Joe, adjoining St. Cloud on the north, had a saw and\r\nflour mill erected in 1855. These mills were burned in 1886, and\r\nrebuilt in 1887. Amongst the early settlers were J. H. Lineman in\r\n1854, J. A. Upham and George Rieder in 1855.\r\n\r\nPETER SCHAELER, a farmer, a native of Germany, came to America in\r\n1850, and to St. Joseph in 1856. John, his only son, retains the old\r\nhomestead, and was in 1883 engaged in the insurance business in St.\r\nCloud.\r\n\r\nJOHN L. WILSON was born in Columbia, Washington county, Maine, in\r\n1820. He came to Minnesota in 1851, locating at St. Anthony, but in\r\nthe following year removed to Sauk Rapids and in 1854 to St. Cloud.\r\nThe first deed on record in Stearns county was from John L. Wilson to\r\nL. C. Kenna, and bears date of 1855. In 1855 he was married to Harriet\r\nN. Corbett. They have three children living.\r\n\r\nCHARLES T. STEARNS, from whom the county took its name, has been for\r\nmany years a resident of Louisiana, and is a wealthy planter.\r\n\r\nHENRY G. FILLMORE, a nephew of President Fillmore, was born in the\r\nstate of New York in the '20s, and came to Watab in 1848. He has lived\r\nin St. Cloud many years.\r\n\r\nNATHANIEL GETCHELL was born in Washington county, Maine, in 1828. He\r\ncame to St. Anthony in 1852, and to Stearns county in 1855.\r\n\r\nJAMES KEOUGH came from Ireland to America in 1850, and directly to\r\nWatab. He settled in St. Cloud in 1854, was married in 1855, and has a\r\nlarge family.\r\n\r\nLOREN W. COLLINS was born in Lowell, Massachusetts, Aug. 22, 1839. He\r\nreceived a common school education; came to Hastings, Minnesota, some\r\ntime prior to the Rebellion, studied law with Smith & Crosby and was\r\nadmitted to practice, but in August, 1862, entered the service of his\r\ncountry in Company F, Seventh Minnesota Volunteers, of which company\r\nhe was commissioned second lieutenant, and a year later first\r\nlieutenant. He was discharged with his regiment at the close of the\r\nwar, and returned to his law practice. In 1866 he removed to St. Cloud\r\nand practiced law. He served as county attorney a number of years; was\r\na member of the Minnesota house of representatives in 1881-83; was\r\nappointed judge of the Seventh Judicial district April 8, 1883, and\r\nelected to that office in 1884. Nov. 12, 1887, he was appointed to\r\nfill the vacancy caused by the death of Judge Berry, an appointment\r\nthat gives general satisfaction, Judge Collins having won an enviable\r\nreputation as a jurist and as a man.\r\n\r\nHENRY C. WAITE was born in Albany county, New York, in 1830; graduated\r\nat Union College, Schenectady, New York; was admitted to practice law\r\nin 1852, and the same year came to Iowa. A year later he removed to\r\nWisconsin, and located at Madison, where he practiced law two years.\r\nIn May, 1855, he came to St. Cloud, where he has since continuously\r\nresided. The first ten years of his residence in St. Cloud he devoted\r\nto the practice of his profession, after which he devoted his time to\r\nfarming and milling.\r\n\r\nMr. Waite was a member of the constitutional convention in 1857. He\r\nalso served several terms in the senate and house. During President\r\nLincoln's administration he served as register of the land office. He\r\nwas married to Maria D. Clark in 1860. He has two sons.\r\n\r\nGEN. S. B. LOWRY was the son of the devoted and zealous missionary,\r\nRev. David Lowry, who labored among the Winnebagoes in Northern Iowa\r\nin the '30s and '40s. He located first at Brockway, ten miles above\r\nSt. Cloud, and established a trading post, but in 1853 removed to St.\r\nCloud, where he surveyed and platted the village of Acadia, afterward\r\nknown as \"Lowry's addition.\" He made St. Cloud his home until his\r\ndeath, which occurred in 1861.\r\n\r\nANTHONY EDELBROCK was the first resident of St. Cloud. His oldest son\r\nwas the first child born there. This son died in infancy. His second\r\nson became the abbot of St. John's University. Mr. Edelbrock is now a\r\nresident of Missouri.\r\n\r\nJOSEPH EDELBROCK was born in Westphalia, Prussia, in 1826. He learned\r\nthe trade of a carpenter, came to America in 1847, and lived in\r\nChicago until 1855, when he came to St. Cloud and engaged in\r\nmercantile pursuits. He is the oldest merchant continuously in\r\nbusiness in the city. He served as sheriff two years and as register\r\nof deeds four years. He was married in Chicago in 1852, and has six\r\nchildren living. A daughter, the second child born in St. Cloud, is\r\nthe wife of Peter E. Kaiser.\r\n\r\nJOHN RENGEL, made a claim here in 1855. He has been and still is a\r\nprosperous citizen. He has a family of ten children.\r\n\r\nLOUIS A. EVANS was born near Philadelphia, Nov. 2, 1822. His\r\nforefathers came to America with William Penn and bought of him a\r\ntownship of land, on which still reside many of his descendants. His\r\nfather served as a soldier in the war of 1812. Louis was educated at\r\nthe graded schools in Philadelphia; was apprenticed to a piano maker,\r\nand worked at his trade at Cincinnati, Ohio, Clinton, Mississippi, and\r\nNew Orleans until 1856, when he came to St. Cloud, where he still\r\nresides. During his residence he has served as postmaster, judge of\r\nprobate, clerk of the district court, editor of the St. Cloud _Times_,\r\nmayor of St. Cloud, and president of the council and member of the\r\nhouse and senate of the state legislature. He was married to Elisabeth\r\nW. Libby in 1871.\r\n\r\nAMBROSE FREEMAN.--We have no datum as to when Mr. Freeman came to St.\r\nCloud, but it was probably prior to 1860. He was a stonemason, and\r\nwhile working on a cellar wall heard the report of the Sioux uprising\r\nand massacre (in 1862), and, dropping his tools, hurried off to\r\nsatisfy himself as to the truth of the reports, called a meeting of\r\ncitizens, and organized a company of twenty-five volunteers to assist\r\nin caring for the wounded and burying the dead. On his return he was\r\ncommissioned captain of the Northern Rangers and marched with his\r\ncommand to the relief of Forest City and Fort Abercrombie. He was with\r\nGen. Sibley's command in 1863, and while riding over the prairie was\r\nshot with an arrow by an Indian, and expired instantly.\r\n\r\nNATHAN F. BARNES has lived a somewhat eventful life. He was born at\r\nPortland, Maine, June 26, 1817; received an academic education; served\r\nas a midshipman in the navy from 1834 to 1839, visiting many parts of\r\nthe globe. In 1840 he commenced the study of law, was admitted to\r\npractice in 1843 and practiced awhile at Conway, New Hampshire, where\r\nin 1844 he was married. In 1850 he was appointed mail agent on the\r\nIsthmus route to California, served six years, and then located in\r\nCalifornia. Two years later, in 1858, he removed to Alexandria,\r\nMinnesota. During the Sioux massacre he and Andreas Darling were the\r\nonly persons remaining in the neighborhood who escaped being killed.\r\nIn 1865 he came to St. Cloud, where he has been an active and\r\nprominent citizen. He served many years as city clerk and city\r\njustice and was elected to the house of the state legislature in 1875.\r\nHe was influential in securing the location of the normal school in\r\nSt. Cloud. One son, Percival S., died in the Saulsbury prison during\r\nthe Civil War. He has one son and one daughter living.\r\n\r\nNEHEMIAH P. CLARK was born in Worcester county, Massachusetts, April\r\n8, 1836. In his youth he attended school in Kentucky and at seventeen\r\nyears of age was clerking in a store at Fond du Lac, Wisconsin. In\r\n1856 he came to St. Cloud and engaged actively in business, selling\r\ngoods, farming, staging, lumbering, and dealing in pine lands. He has\r\na farm in Le Sauk of 2,000 acres, a creamery, a cheese factory, and\r\none of the largest and best herds of cattle, horses, hogs and sheep in\r\nthe State. For office and official honors he has no taste. He served,\r\nhowever, as president of the State Agricultural Society in 1886.\r\n\r\nOSCAR E. GARRISON was born at Fort Ann, New York, in 1825, and was\r\nearly thrown upon his own resources. He came to Minnesota in 1850, and\r\nbuilt the first house on the shores of Lake Minnetonka where Wayzata\r\nis now located. In 1850 he surveyed and platted the village of\r\nWayzata. In 1860 he came to St. Cloud. He made a land claim in Polk\r\ncounty in 1862 and narrowly escaped being murdered by the Sioux at\r\ntheir uprising. His house and property were destroyed. While hiding\r\nwith his wife and four-year-old son, Indians passed within twenty feet\r\nof him. After a perilous night journey, during which he came almost\r\nwithin touching distance of sleeping Indians, he arrived safely at\r\nSauk Centre.\r\n\r\nTHE GILMAN FAMILY.--The Gilman family of which Charles A. is a\r\ndescendant came to America from Hingham, England, with the Folsoms, in\r\n1638, and are the founders of the town of Hingham, Massachusetts. The\r\nGilmans were renowned for their loyalty to the colonies, and later to\r\nthe state and national government.\r\n\r\nCHARLES A. GILMAN was born in Gilmanton, New Hampshire, Feb. 9, 1833.\r\nHis youth was spent at home, where he received a common school and\r\nacademic education, the latter at Gilmanton Academy. He taught school\r\nduring the winters. In 1855 he came to Sauk Rapids, Benton county,\r\nwhere he engaged in farming and real estate business; he also filled\r\nthe offices of auditor and register of deeds. In 1861 he removed to\r\nSt. Cloud, having been appointed register of the United States land\r\noffice for that place. He served seven years as register and receiver.\r\nHe studied law, and was admitted to practice in 1876. Mr. Gilman has\r\nlived a busy life, and besides his real estate, law, surveying and\r\nexploring business, he has taken a conspicuous position in the\r\npolitics of his State, having served as state senator in the years\r\n1868-69, and as representative from 1875 to 1879. In 1878-79 he served\r\nas speaker of the house. From 1881 to 1884 he was lieutenant governor\r\nof the State. He was elected to the legislature several times as a\r\nRepublican, when the district was strongly Democratic, a high\r\ncompliment to his ability and integrity. He was married to Hester\r\nCronk, at Sauk Rapids, Jan. 1, 1857. They have six children living. He\r\nhas lived at St. Cloud since 1861, where he has a delightful home.\r\n\r\nOf St. Cloud citizens not elsewhere mentioned in this work, and who\r\nhave been prominent in advancing its interests, are Charles Bridgman,\r\nHenry G. Mitchell and son, C. F. McDonald, Lewis Clark, Alonzo F.\r\nCramb, C. F. Davis, Levi S. Geer, Josiah G. Hayward, David L. Kiehle,\r\nA. Montgomery, Overbeck brothers, John H. Owen, and John Cooper. St.\r\nCloud has furnished three able jurists for the supreme bench in this\r\ndistrict, E. O. Hamlin, J. M. McKelvy and L. W. Collins.\r\n\r\n\r\nANOKA COUNTY.\r\n\r\nAnoka county was organized in 1857, the nucleus or first settlement\r\nbeing a small village on the Mississippi, at the month of Rum river,\r\nnamed Anoka, from a Chippewa word meaning work or labor. The county\r\nhas a fine location on the east bank of the Mississippi. Its\r\nboundaries on the north are Isanti county, on the east Chisago and\r\nWashington counties, on the south Ramsey county, and on the west\r\nSherburne county and the Mississippi river. Rum river flows in a\r\nsoutheasterly direction through the county, and by this river, its\r\ntributaries and those of the Mississippi and St. Croix, the county is\r\nwell watered and drained. The valleys of these streams furnish many\r\nfine natural meadows. The soil is a black sandy loam with clay\r\nsubsoil. Townships 31, 32 and 33, range 22, are drained by the\r\ntributaries of the St. Croix. Originally consisting of oak openings,\r\nnatural meadows and tamarack swamps, interspersed with small lakes,\r\nwith excellent roads, school houses, churches and town organizations,\r\nthe county is well settled and has many fine farms under a high state\r\nof cultivation. Its proximity to the pineries of Rum river and to the\r\nmarkets of Minneapolis and St. Paul makes it a desirable location for\r\nthe lumbermen and farmers.\r\n\r\nThe county is subdivided into the following townships: Anoka, Bethel,\r\nBlaine, Burns, Centreville, Columbus, Fridley, Grow, Ham Lake,\r\nLinwood, Oak Grove, Ramsey, and St. Francis. The Northern Pacific and\r\nSt. Paul, Minneapolis & Manitoba railroads traverse this county near\r\nits western boundary, following the course of the Mississippi river.\r\nOutside of Anoka the first settlement in the county was within the\r\nbounds of the present town of Ramsey. Nathan Shumway, Cornelius Pitman\r\nand Daniel Hawthorne settled there in 1850.\r\n\r\nThe first county commissioners were appointed by the governor. They\r\nwere E. C. H. Davis, J. P. Austin and Silas O. Lum. They met June 30,\r\n1857, and appointed the following officers: Sheriff, James C. Frost;\r\ntreasurer, James M. McGlauflin; coroner, Joseph C. Varney; assessors,\r\nDaniel Robbins, S. L. Guice, Francis Peeler. The first deed on record\r\nin the county bears date of June 30, 1857. It conveys the northwest\r\nquarter of section 26, township 33, range 24, from Nathaniel S. Davis\r\nto Mary S. Small, for a consideration of five hundred dollars. There\r\nis, however, a transcript of a deed from Ramsey county bearing\r\noriginal date of Sept. 11, 1849, conveying the north half of the\r\nnorthwest quarter of section 35, township 31, range 24, from Abel\r\nBloodgood, of Minnesota Territory, to Henry M. Rice, for a\r\nconsideration of two hundred dollars. The first town plat, that of\r\nAnoka, bears date of July 5, 1854.\r\n\r\n\r\nANOKA.\r\n\r\nThis town lies on the east shore of the Mississippi and includes part\r\nof fractional township 31, range 24. It is watered by Rum river, which\r\ntraverses the northwestern part, and by Coon creek in the eastern\r\npart. The town originally was chiefly prairie. Its early history is\r\nincluded in that of Anoka county.\r\n\r\n\r\nANOKA CITY.\r\n\r\nThe county seat of Anoka county is located on the Mississippi at the\r\nmouth of Rum river and dates its settlement to the year 1847, when\r\nThomas Holmes located on the east bank of the river, and built the\r\nfirst log house for a trading post. Aaron Betts, in the employ of\r\nHolmes, brought his family with him, the first family in the town. In\r\nthe winter of 1847-48 Holmes sold out to Simeon P. Folsom, whose\r\nfamily was the second in the town. Mr. Folsom raised the first crop in\r\nthe township. In September, 1848, Mr. Folsom removed to Sherburne\r\ncounty, selling out his claim to Louis Roberts. In the winter of the\r\nsame year Wm. Dahl took possession for Mr. Roberts. In the spring of\r\n1849 Antoine Roberts, brother of Louis, came from Prairie du Chien,\r\ntook possession of the home, and lived there some years, when he was\r\nkilled by an Indian. When the land on which the improvements were made\r\nwas brought into market Louis Roberts entered it.\r\n\r\nIn 1851 Anton Guion entered a quarter section of land on the west\r\nside. He immediately sold his claim to Henry M. Rice, who bought it\r\nwith the intention of platting it as a town site. His brother, Orrin\r\nRice, occupied it and made improvements. Rum river has a fall of five\r\nfeet, which is fully utilized at Anoka.\r\n\r\nIn 1851 Geo. W. Branch took up a claim on the west side, and built a\r\nhouse near what is now the corner of Main and Ferry streets. This was\r\nthe first frame house in Anoka, which, from this time forward, grew\r\nalmost imperceptibly into a village, till in 1855 the census showed\r\nnearly 300 inhabitants. In 1860 the population was 602, and in 1886,\r\n5,000. Anoka was incorporated as a city in 1878, with the following\r\nboard of officers: Mayor, G. W. Church; aldermen, D. C. Dunham, D. H.\r\nLane, L. G. Browning, A. Davis, H. N. Seelye, and J. H. Pierce;\r\ntreasurer, H. E. Lepper; justices of the peace, W. W. Fitch and E. S.\r\nTeller; constables, George Geddes and Norman McLean. At that time the\r\ncity was divided into two wards, the First including the east side,\r\nand the Second the west side, of Rum river. In 1881 the west side was\r\nchanged to the First ward, and the east side became the Second and\r\nThird wards.\r\n\r\nIn 1853 Ed. I. Shaw built and opened the first store. It was on the\r\nwest side, and the building still stands, and is known as the Schuler\r\nbuilding. It is now the hospital: Caleb and W. H. Woodbury erected a\r\nsaw mill on the east side. It was subsequently owned by Woodbury, Shaw\r\n& Farnham. During the same year a bridge was built across Rum river by\r\nthe government; Orrin Rice, contractor. The first flour will was\r\nfinished in 1855. It was burned ten days after with $5,000 worth of\r\nwheat and corn a total loss, as there was no insurance. It was owned\r\nby A. P. Lane, Caleb and Henry Woodbury. The mill was rebuilt by Caleb\r\nWoodbury and Wm. L. Barnes. In 1855 H. L. Ticknor erected and opened\r\nthe first store on the east side. Rev. Royal Twitchell preached the\r\nfirst sermon and taught the first school. The first mill was utilized\r\non Sundays as a church.\r\n\r\nThe Congregationalists organized the first church in Anoka in 1855,\r\nand erected a church building in 1857. The Baptists and Catholics\r\norganized in 1856, the Methodists and Episcopalians in 1860, the\r\nUniversalists in 1867, the Swedish Lutherans in 1870, the Adventists\r\nin 1880, and the Free Methodists in 1882. The Masons organized a lodge\r\nin 1866, the Knights of Pythias in 1872, the United Workmen in 1877,\r\nthe Patrons of Husbandry in 1874, and the Odd Fellows in 1882.\r\n\r\nAnoka has suffered from time to time by fires. A flour mill, two saw\r\nmills, half a dozen hotels, and a large number of stores have been\r\nburned at different times, and twice the business part of the city has\r\nbeen destroyed. Aug. 16, 1884, the entire business portion of the\r\ncity, including 60 business blocks and the Washburn mills, was\r\nconsumed. The loss amounted to $750,000, on which there was an\r\ninsurance of $316,000. The burnt district has since been handsomely\r\nrebuilt, and the Washburn flour mill has been replaced with a superior\r\nbuilding, five stories high, 60 × 180, ground plan, and rising to the\r\nheight of 112 feet. This is one of the finest mills in the State.\r\n\r\nThe court house is valued at $35,000, the city hall at $12,000, and\r\nfour school buildings at $75,000. The bridge across the Mississippi, a\r\nfine structure, 700 feet long, was built at a cost of $100,000. Street\r\ncars have been introduced on some of the streets. The principal\r\nmanufactories are the Lincoln flouring mill, with a capacity of seven\r\nhundred bushels per day, owned by the Washburn Mill Company; four saw\r\nmills belonging to the Washburn Mill Company, with a capacity of\r\n50,000,000 feet per year; the Anoka Sash and Door Factory, one of the\r\nmost thriving industries in the city, Jonas Morell, manager; a starch\r\nfactory, a boot and shoe company, with a capital of $30,000, recently\r\norganized. Other industries are well represented; the whole giving\r\nemployment to over 1,000 men.\r\n\r\nThe First National Bank of Anoka was organized as a private banking\r\ninstitution in 1872. It became a state bank in 1882, with a capital\r\nstock of $25,000, and a national bank in 1883, with a paid up capital\r\nof $50,000. The officers are: President, H. L. Ticknor; cashier, B. F.\r\nPratt. The Anoka National Bank was organized in 1883, with a paid up\r\ncapital of $100,000. The officers are: President, W. D. Washburn; vice\r\npresident, C. C. Crane; cashier. C. S. Guderian.\r\n\r\n\r\nBETHEL\r\n\r\nIncludes township 33 and the twelve south sections of township 34,\r\nrange 23. Its surface is partially prairie land, and is dotted with\r\nsmall lakes. The first settlers were Quakers, with the exception of\r\nRice, Price, O. Evans and Robert Minard, who came in 1855. Bethel post\r\noffice is located at what is known as Bethel Corners. The town was\r\norganized in 1858. The first supervisors were O. Evans, W. Dickens and\r\nR. Price.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLAINE,\r\n\r\nNamed in honor of James G. Blaine, embraces township 31, range 23. It\r\nwas originally included in Anoka, but was set off and organized in\r\n1877. The first supervisors were Moses Ripley, George Tisdale and\r\nRichard de Long. The records have not been kept with sufficient\r\naccuracy to enable us to determine who were the first settlers. It\r\nappears, however, that the first comers abandoned their claims. Green\r\nChambers is the first settler recorded. He came in 1865.\r\n\r\n\r\nBURNS\r\n\r\nIncludes township 33, range 25, and is in the northwestern part of the\r\ncounty. The soil is clay loam, and in the western part are many lakes.\r\nOf these Twin lakes are ninety feet in depth.

The first settlers were George Armsby and E. Fowler, in 1855.\r\nThe town was organized in 1857, but the records have been lost. Dwight\r\nWoodbury, who has been prominent in the history of the county, located\r\na water power flour and saw mill and built a hotel on Rum river where\r\nthe village of St. Francis has since been built, and surveyed the\r\nvillage plat. The mills were destroyed by fire in 1869, but were\r\nimmediately rebuilt. In 1880 a bridge across Rum river was built at an\r\nexpense of $7,000. Mr. Woodbury's investments have been over $25,000.\r\nMr. Streetly opened the first store and was first postmaster at St.\r\nFrancis.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN INDIAN RIOT.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1847 a German baron, a single man, and Wm. Noot and\r\nwife settled on Big island, in the Mississippi, about two miles above\r\nthe mouth of Rum river. They were traders. In March, 1848, in\r\nconsequence of the revolution in Germany, the baron returned to his\r\nnative land. Noot remained until June, when the Winnebago Indians were\r\nremoved by Gen. Fletcher. Pending their removal the Winnebagoes made a\r\nraid on the trading post, confiscated the whisky and provisions and\r\nfastened Noot in a stable and his wife and child in a small cabin,\r\nwhere they were found by S. P. Folsom the same day, surrounded by\r\ndrunken Indians and in imminent peril. Noot appealed to Folsom for\r\naid. The Indians, however, were furious and threatened Folsom's life.\r\nThe chief, \"Whistling Thunder,\" used his influence in a novel way to\r\nquiet the turbulent, by placing before them all that remained of the\r\nbarrel of whisky, which they eagerly drank. Folsom then released Noot.\r\nThe wife, who had been previously released, ran with her child,\r\nfrightened out of her wits, no one knew whither. After a long search\r\nthe captain found her, and at great risk took her across a slough to\r\nthe mainland in a canoe, which nearly sank before the shore was\r\nreached. Noot afterward went to St. Paul and purchased eighty acres of\r\nland, now in the heart of the city. He was a member of the house,\r\nFourth and Fifth Minnesota legislatures. At present he resides at Big\r\nLake, Sherburne county.\r\n\r\nJARED BENSON.--Mr. Benson was the son of Jared and Sallie Taft Benson,\r\nand was born in Blackstone. Massachusetts, Nov. 8, 1821.

It was\r\nnamed in honor of Judge Moses Sherburne, an appointee to the bench of\r\nthe supreme court of Minnesota Territory. The county is bounded on the\r\nnorth by Benton, on the east by Anoka and Isanti counties, and on the\r\nsouth by the Mississippi river. It is somewhat irregularly timbered\r\nwith pine and hardwood, interspersed with oak openings, rolling\r\nprairie lands and natural meadows. The surface is generally\r\nundulating. A prominent ridge of high land, from three to five miles\r\nwide, extends from Elk river in a northeasterly direction into Anoka\r\ncounty. The county is well watered by tributaries of the Mississippi,\r\nElk and St. Louis rivers, and has besides many clear and sparkling\r\nlakes. The soil is mostly sandy loam with clay subsoil, and valuable\r\ngranite quarries are found in the northern tier of towns.\r\n\r\nDavid Faribault was the first settler or trader, he having established\r\na post on the Elk river in 1846, where he made a garden and raised\r\npotatoes. In September, 1848, H. M. Rice and S. P. Folsom bought\r\nFaribault's improvements, and Folsom moved his family to the place and\r\nbuilt a log cabin on what is now Auditor's addition to Elk River\r\nvillage. He was succeeded in the ownership by Pierre Bottineau.\r\n\r\nThe county was organized in 1856, under territorial law. The governor,\r\nWillis A. Gorman, appointed J. H.

Jamieson, county attorney; Orlando Bailey, sheriff.\r\nThe first commissioners' meeting was held at the house of Joseph\r\nBrown, at the village of Humboldt, which was made the county seat and\r\nso remained until 1867, when it was removed to Elk River village. The\r\ncounty was attached to Benton for judicial purposes until 1862. Prior\r\nto this Mr. Brown's house was used for county commissioners' meetings\r\nand for courtrooms until burned down some years later, when the\r\ncommissioners met at the house of John E. Putnam.\r\n\r\nA court house was built at Elk River on lots donated by J. Q. A.\r\nNickerson, the village donating $1,000 and the county the remainder\r\nnecessary for the building.\r\n\r\nPrior to the formation of the state government, the county was divided\r\ninto election precincts. The first term of district court was held at\r\nHumboldt in December, 1862; Judge C. E. Vanderburgh, presiding; J. E.\r\nPutnam acting as clerk. The first commissioners who held their meeting\r\nat Elk River were H. Houlton, chairman; A. Boyington and O. Bailey.\r\nThe first meetings were held at the house of J. Q. A. Nickerson.\r\n\r\nIn 1867 the St. Paul, Minneapolis & Manitoba railroad was completed\r\nthrough the county on a line parallel with the general course of the\r\nMississippi river. The North Pacific railroad, since built, runs\r\nparallel on the same grade. The depots were built upon the same plan\r\nand placed on opposite sides of the two tracks. The stations are Elk\r\nRiver, Big Lake, Becker, Clear Lake, and East St. Cloud. The Manitoba\r\nhas a branch line from Elk River to Princeton and Milacca, built in\r\n1884.\r\n\r\nThe first deed recorded was transcribed from the Benton county\r\nrecords, transfers of property from James Beatty to Richard Chute and\r\nDavid Olmstead, and bears date of July 28, 1851.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOWNS.\r\n\r\nThe towns in Sherburne are: Baldwin, deriving its name from F.

The office was\r\nmerged into the Elk River post office in 1853. This post office, with\r\nthe mills erected in 1851, became the nucleus of the Elk River\r\nsettlement, which some years later became Elk River village, within\r\nthe corporate limits of which Orono is now situated. Orono was\r\nsurveyed and platted May, 1855; Ard Godfrey, proprietor.\r\n\r\n\r\nELK RIVER,\r\n\r\nLocated originally about a mile below Orono, was not platted as a\r\nvillage until 1865. J. Q. A. and Julia Nickerson were the proprietors.\r\nIt is on the east bank of the Mississippi, at its junction with Elk\r\nriver, above which it now extends a distance of two miles. It has a\r\npleasant location. It was incorporated in 1881, with C. S. Wheaton,\r\npresident; W. T. Struble, recorder; N. K. Whittemore, H. P. Burrell\r\nand L. Pollard, commissioners. Elk river affords a fine water power\r\nwith ten feet head. Mills were erected here in 1851. A great fire in\r\nMay, 1887, destroyed mill property valued at $50,000. Since the fire a\r\nflour mill with a capacity of 250 barrels a day has been completed at\r\na cost of $25,000. A saw mill is also in process of construction. The\r\nvillage has an elevator with a capacity of 10,000 bushels, 2 town\r\nhalls, 3 churches, Episcopal, Free Will Baptist and Congregational; a\r\nfirst class school building, with rooms for four departments; a school\r\nbuilding at Orono, with two departments; and two railroad depots,\r\nbuilt at a cost of $9,000.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1885, a private bank was incorporated as the Bank of Elk\r\nRiver.\r\n\r\n\r\nEAST ST. CLOUD,\r\n\r\nIn the town of Haven, is a thriving village. It has one of the best\r\ngranite quarries in the State.

Its first settler was Joseph Brown,\r\na veteran pioneer, but not to be confounded with the invincible Joe R.\r\nBrown, elsewhere referred to. Mr. Brown came here in 1848, and made\r\nsubstantial improvements. He died in 1886. His family still reside\r\nhere. James Ely and Newell Houghton also settled here in 1884. Mr.\r\nHoughton was killed at the New Ulm massacre in 1862.\r\n\r\nJOHN QUINCY ADAMS NICKERSON was born in New Salem, Franklin county,\r\nMaine, March 30, 1825.

F.\r\nHildreth, purchased for a hotel. The house has been enlarged from time\r\nto time, and has been continuously under the charge of Mr. Nickerson.\r\nHe has besides employed much of his time in farming and lumbering, and\r\nhas dealt in village lots. He was appointed postmaster at an early\r\nday. He has filled various responsible offices, among them that of\r\ncounty treasurer and town and county supervisor. He was married to\r\nJulia A. Farnham, of St. Anthony Falls, Oct. 2, 1852.

Taylor through the Mexican lines to an American\r\nfort. He was a target for the bullets of the Mexican Army, but arrived\r\nat his destination severely wounded. He was discharged on account of\r\nhis wounds. In 1855 he came to Clear Lake and made him a home. He\r\noffered himself as a volunteer during the late Civil War, but was not\r\nreceived on account of age and disability. He died at his home at\r\nClear Lake in 1885.\r\n\r\nFRANCIS DE LILLE, of French descent, was born in Canada in 1782. He\r\ncame with his family to St. Anthony in 1848, and in 1852 to Elk River,\r\nwhere he occupied the first house built in the lower town.

Howard was\r\nnear his father and was struck senseless by the same flash that\r\ndeprived him of a father. Recovering, he set himself earnestly and\r\nseriously to the duties of life, performed his allotted tasks about\r\nthe household, and succeeded in obtaining a good high school\r\neducation. He came to Princeton, Mille Lacs county, in 1856, studied\r\nlaw and was admitted to practice in Mille Lacs county in 1863.\r\nSubsequently he practiced law five years in St. Cloud. He came to Elk\r\nRiver in 1876. He has held official positions in Mille Lacs, Stearns\r\nand Sherburne counties. Mr. Atkins has acquired an honorable position\r\nthrough his own exertions and richly deserves the respect of his\r\nfellow citizens. He was married in 1862 to Virginia Sinclair, of\r\nIllinois. They have two sons and four daughters.\r\n\r\nB. F. HILDRETH was born in Milford, Maine, March, 1822. He learned the\r\ntrade of a blacksmith and came to St. Anthony in 1849, and the year\r\nfollowing did part of the crew work of the first steamer launched on\r\nthe Mississippi above the falls. Since then he has engaged chiefly in\r\nlumbering and farming. In 1850 he was married to M. E. Farnham, of St.\r\nAnthony. He removed to Elk River in 1873.\r\n\r\nSAMUEL HAYDEN was born Oct. 12, 1806, at Madison, Maine. He came to\r\nLivonia, Sherburne county, in 1856. He has a family of four sons and\r\nthree daughters, residents of Minnesota. His brother, the Hon.\r\nWentworth Hayden, was a member of the constitutional convention of\r\n1857.\r\n\r\nThe writer of these sketches had known Mr. Samuel Hayden in early\r\nlife, and distinctly remembered seeing him the winter of 1827, driving\r\nan ox team in the pineries on Dead river, Maine. He was then a young\r\nman of twenty-one, and the writer was a boy of ten. Sixty years later\r\nthey met in Sherburne county, and the writer recognized in the aged\r\nman of eighty-one years the young man of twenty-one, though for the\r\nmoment unable to call his name. It is seldom that memory bridges so\r\nwide a chasm.\r\n\r\nJOSEPH JEROME settled in the town of Haven in 1846, and is therefore\r\namong the first of the pioneers. In 1848 he sold his property to\r\nSamuel Sturgis and removed to Michigan.\r\n\r\nJOSHUA O. CATER came from Stafford county, New Hampshire, and was one\r\nof the earliest settlers of the town of Haven, where he still lives.\r\n\r\nJ. F. BEAN also came from New Hampshire to Sherburne county, and is\r\nnow a resident of Livonia, and postmaster at Lake Fremont.\r\n\r\nJ. H. FELCH, of Maine, an early settler of Livonia, is now living at\r\nElk River.\r\n\r\nJAMES BRADY came to Palmer in 1855. He died about 1868.\r\n\r\nJOSHUA BRIGGS settled in Palmer in 1855, and died there in 1881.\r\n\r\nROBERT ORROCK, for whom the town of Orrock was named, died at his\r\nhome, at a good old age, January, 1885.\r\n\r\nJOHN G. JAMIESON died at Elk River in 1869.\r\n\r\nA. B. HEATH removed to Oregon in 1873, where he still lives.\r\n\r\nDR. B. R. PALMER, for whom the town of Palmer was named, was a\r\nresident of Sauk Centre and died there in 1885.\r\n\r\nJUDGE MOSES SHERBURNE, for whom the county was named, died at Elk\r\nRiver in 1869.\r\n\r\nCHAS. F. GEORGE, who settled in Santiago in 1856, is at present\r\nchairman of the board of county commissioners.\r\n\r\nROYAL GEORGE, a pioneer of the same date, returned to Vermont, where\r\nhe died in 1887.\r\n\r\nW. L. BABCOCK, a merchant of Santiago, still resides here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nBENTON COUNTY.\r\n\r\nAt the organization of Minnesota Territory three counties were\r\ncreated, of which Benton was one. Its eastern boundary followed the\r\ncourse of Rum river from its mouth to its junction with the west\r\nbranch and thence a line due north to the Mississippi river. The\r\nboundary line upon the west followed the windings of the Mississippi\r\ndown to its junction with Rum river, making a county large and\r\nirregular in outline, extending from north to south about one hundred\r\nmiles, and about forty at its widest point from east to west. The\r\nformation of new counties since that time has left it with less than\r\neleven townships lying east of the Mississippi river and bounded on\r\nthe north by Morrison, on the east by Mille Lacs, and on the south by\r\nSherburne counties. The soil is diversified. There is black sandy loam\r\nin the plains and a black vegetable mould in the timber, with clay\r\nsubsoils. It is a fair agricultural district, having groves of pine\r\nand hardwood in the east and natural meadows, prairies and oak\r\nopenings in the central and western portions. It is well watered by\r\nthe Mississippi and its tributaries, Elk, Little Rock and Platte\r\nrivers. It has some fine lakes, of which Mayhew, Briggs and Little\r\nRock are the largest. A granite formation underlies most of this\r\ncounty and crops out in many places, furnishing valuable quarries. The\r\ngranite is plain and variegated and is being worked and shipped\r\nextensively. Near the village of Watab there is a rich upheaval. The\r\nSt. Paul custom house is made of the Watab granite.\r\n\r\nThe Northern Pacific railway passes through this county parallel with\r\nthe channel of the Mississippi river. The Manitoba, St. Cloud &\r\nHinckley branch passes through the southern tier of towns. The\r\norganized towns are Alberta, Gilmanton, Glendorado, Granite Lodge,\r\nMaywood, Minden, Sauk Rapids, St. George, and Watab. The villages are\r\nEast St. Cloud, Foley, Oak Grove, Rice's, and Watab.\r\n\r\nThe first settlers were Philip Beaupre, in 1844; David Gilman, in\r\n1848; Jeremiah Russell, Wm. H. Wood, James Beatty, Ellis Kling, Wm.\r\nSmith, and J. C. Mayhew, in 1849. Sauk Rapids was made the county\r\nseat, then Watab, then Sauk Rapids.\r\n\r\nThe first board of officers, qualified Jan. 7, 1850, were:\r\nCommissioners, Wm. A. Aitkin, chairman; Joseph Brown and James Beatty;\r\nassessors, Truman A. Warren and Reuben M. Richardson; attorney, W. D.\r\nPhillips. The voting precincts were at Sauk Rapids, Swan River and\r\nCrow Wing. The judges of election were: For Sauk Rapids, J. Russell,\r\nWm. Sturgis and Curtis Bellows; for Swan River, Philip Beaupre, James\r\nGreen and Duncan Stewart; for Crow Wing, Allen Morrison, Wm. Morrison\r\nand Sylvester Stateler. The first election was held at Pierre\r\nBottineau's house, now in Sherburne county. George Egbert and Thomas\r\nHolmes were judges of election.\r\n\r\nThe first court in the county was held Nov. 11, 1850; Bradley B.\r\nMeeker, presiding. David Gilman was the first sheriff, John C. Hawley\r\nthe second. The first deed recorded was from James Hitchins to Wm. F.\r\nCoblett. It bore date of Oct. 21, 1850. Taylor Dudley was register of\r\ndeeds. The land conveyed was a tract lying at the foot of Sauk Rapids,\r\nbeing a land claim of one hundred and sixty acres, purchased from\r\nCalvin Potter.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAUK RAPIDS.\r\n\r\nThe site of the village of Sauk Rapids was judiciously chosen. It\r\nslopes gently to the river's east bank, giving a pleasant frontage to\r\nthe rapids. Philip Beaupre came here first in 1844. His son, William\r\nP., was the first white child here, born May 24, 1852. Geo. O. Sweet\r\nwas the second, born Aug. 22, 1852. Several Indian traders located\r\nhere and at Watab. Following Mr. Beaupre came T. A. Holmes, James\r\nBeatty, J. Russell, Calvin Potter, James Hitchins, Curtis Bellows, and\r\nCharles Webb. The first plat of Sauk Rapids was made and recorded in\r\n1854. The proprietors were J. Russell, G. M. Sweet and S. Van Nest.\r\nThe surveyor was C. B. Chapman.\r\n\r\nThe village was incorporated in 1881. The commissioners appointed\r\nunder the general act to effect the organization were Alphonso J.\r\nDemenles, Erasmus Cross, B. K. Knowlton. A wagon bridge built across\r\nthe Mississippi at this point cost $25,000. It was greatly damaged by\r\na storm, and partially destroyed by the cyclone of 1886.\r\n\r\nThe dam across the Mississippi at Sauk Rapids was built in 1870 at a\r\ncost of $140,000. The east wing is owned by the Commodore Davidson\r\nestate; the west, by the Sauk Rapids Manufacturing Company.\r\n\r\nThe rapids are formed by the eruption of granite ledges across the\r\nchannel of the river. A flour mill built here with a capacity of three\r\nhundred barrels per day was totally destroyed by the cyclone of April\r\n16, 1886, which was one of the most destructive on record. The\r\nestimated loss in Sauk Rapids was $300,000, of which $108,000 was made\r\nup by voluntary contributions from St. Paul, Minneapolis and other\r\nportions of the State.\r\n\r\nThe public buildings, including the court house, school buildings and\r\nseveral churches, were destroyed, together with many fine stores and\r\ndwellings.\r\n\r\nSince the cyclone the village has been handsomely rebuilt. A new court\r\nhouse has replaced the old one at a cost of $6,000, a new school house\r\nhas been built at a cost of $12,000--a model building with rooms for\r\nfive departments. There are five new church buildings, an Episcopal,\r\nCongregational, Methodist and two Lutheran.\r\n\r\n\r\nWATAB.\r\n\r\nWatab appears to have been a noted Indian trading post from 1844 to\r\n1855. Asa White, D. Gilman, C. W. Borup, N. Myrick, Gen. Lowry, and\r\nothers were located, or had stations here. Watab was for a short time\r\nthe county seat of Benton county. A bridge was once built across the\r\nMississippi here, but it has disappeared. The village site was\r\nsurveyed and platted, and a post office established in 1853. P. Lamb\r\nwas postmaster. A steam saw mill was erected here, but was afterward\r\nremoved. The first improved farm in Benton county was located in the\r\nvicinity. David Gilman, Benjamin Bright and George Goodhue were early\r\nsettlers.\r\n\r\nPHILIP BEAUPRE was born in Lower Canada, in 1823. As his name\r\nindicates, he is of French descent. He received a French education. He\r\ncame West in 1841; entered the employ of the fur company in 1843, and\r\nlocated at Sauk Rapids in 1844. When he arrived there were no white\r\ninhabitants, save Indian traders, on the Mississippi north of St.\r\nAnthony. Mr. Beaupre built a log house in 1851, and was continuously\r\nengaged in trade until succeeded by his sons. He assisted in forming\r\nthe county, town and village organizations, filling many offices of\r\ntrust and honor. In 1880 he served as judge of the probate court, and\r\nsince as collector of customs at Pembina. In 1851 he was married to\r\nTeresa de Noyes, of St. Louis, and has a family of seven sons and six\r\ndaughters, all residing in Benton county.\r\n\r\nDAVID GILMAN.--Hon. David Gilman, of Watab, was born April 29, 1812,\r\nat Saratoga, New York. He was left fatherless at the age of six\r\nmonths, and his mother subsequently placed him in the family of a\r\nneighbor to be brought up and cared for until the age of twenty-one.\r\nAs he grew older he was not pleased with this arrangement, and at the\r\nage of fourteen left his home to adventure for himself. His\r\nopportunities for securing an education were limited. In 1836 he came\r\nto Michigan. In 1844 he married Nancy W. Lamb, of Woodstock, Vermont.\r\nIn 1848 he came to Watab, Minnesota, and made him a permanent home,\r\nmaking himself a useful, influential and public spirited citizen,\r\nfilling many positions of trust in his town, county and state\r\ngovernments. Amongst the offices filled by him were those of deputy\r\nUnited States marshal, member of the second territorial legislature,\r\nand of the constitutional convention. He was postmaster at Watab from\r\nthe establishment of the office in 1849 until 1885, when he died,\r\ngreatly lamented by his friends and honored by all who knew him. Mrs.\r\nGilman and four children survive him.\r\n\r\nJAMES BEATTY was born in Fairfield county, Ohio, April 27, 1816. When\r\nfourteen years of age he went to Cass county, Michigan. He farmed for\r\nthe Winnebago Indians near Fort Atkinson, Iowa, for several years, and\r\ncoming to Minnesota in 1848 located at Sauk Rapids, which he made his\r\npermanent home. He has been engaged as Indian trader, hotel keeper,\r\nmerchant and farmer. He was a member of the Minnesota territorial\r\nlegislatures of 1851, 1853 and 1854. He was married to Eliza Foscet,\r\nof New York, in 1854. They have three children living.\r\n\r\nELLIS KLING was born in Dauphin county, Pennsylvania, Oct. 15, 1824.\r\nHe was brought up as a farmer, and has made farming his occupation\r\nthrough life. He came to Sauk Rapids in 1851. In 1854 he was married\r\nto Lucy Lewis, of Belle Prairie. They have five sons and one daughter.\r\n\r\nGEORGE W. BENEDICT.--Mr. Benedict was born at Rochester, New York, in\r\n1827. He served an apprenticeship to a printer in Canada for five\r\nyears. In 1851 he was married to Anna Cronk, a native of Prince Edward\r\ncounty, Canada. For four years he published the Tecumseh (Mich.)\r\n_Herald_ and in 1854, having removed to Sauk Rapids, established the\r\n_Frontiersman_ for Jeremiah Russell. This paper he conducted for three\r\nyears. He then conducted the _New Era_ for one year. In 1868 he\r\nestablished the Sauk Rapids _Sentinel_, which he conducted four years,\r\nwhen he started the Alexandria _Post_ and also became a member of a\r\ncompany that published the St. Cloud _Press_, with which he was\r\nconnected one year. In 1872 he re-established the Sauk Rapids\r\n_Sentinel_, which he sold to W. L. Nieman, but repurchased after the\r\ncyclone of 1886. Mr. Benedict was in the United States revenue service\r\nten years, and served as a member of the state senate one term.\r\n\r\nJ. Q. A. WOOD was born in Chichester, New Hampshire, in 1815. He\r\ngraduated at Union College, New York, in 1843; studied law with\r\nPresident Franklin Pierce; was admitted to practice in 1846, and made\r\nhis home at Sauk Rapids in 1854, which has been his home ever since,\r\nwith the exception of some years spent in Kentucky as editor of the\r\n_Southern Kentucky Shield_. This paper was suppressed in 1862.\r\nReturning to Sauk Rapids in 1864, he engaged in the practice of law,\r\nin which he has since continued. During this period he served eleven\r\nyears as county attorney, and also a term as probate judge. Mr. Wood\r\nwas seriously injured in the great cyclone, having been buried in the\r\ndebris of the court house, from which, with great difficulty, he\r\nextricated himself. Mr. Wood is a poetical writer of some reputation,\r\nmany of his productions having been received with great favor. Among\r\nthem we may mention \"Father is Growing Old, John,\" \"Ode to New\r\nHampshire,\" and \"The Wine of Cyprus.\" He has one son, a resident of\r\nDakota, and one daughter, the wife of D. C. Roberts of West Superior.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM H. WOOD was born in London, New Hampshire, Feb. 2, 1817. When\r\nhe was fourteen years of age his father removed to Tecumseh, Michigan.\r\nHe graduated at Dartmouth College in 1839 and afterward took a course\r\nin Union College, New York, graduating in 1843. He then returned to\r\nTecumseh, Michigan, where he studied law with Judge Stacy. In 1845 he\r\nwas admitted to the bar in Lenawee county, Michigan. During the\r\npresidential campaign of the year following he edited a paper in\r\nKentucky, the _Rough and Ready_, advocating the claims of Gen. Taylor\r\nfor the presidency. In 1848 he located in Greensburg, Kentucky, and in\r\n1849 was married to a lady of refinement, known to the literary world\r\nunder the _nom de plume_ of \"Minnie Mary Lee.\" In 1849 he removed to\r\nSauk Rapids, Minnesota. He was there editor of the pioneer paper, the\r\n_Frontiersman_. He afterward owned, and with his gifted wife edited,\r\nthe _New Era_, in which he was an ardent supporter of Mr. Lincoln for\r\nthe presidency in 1860. Meanwhile he practiced his profession and held\r\nthe office of county attorney for many years. When the land office was\r\nestablished at Sauk Rapids he was appointed receiver and served a\r\nnumber of years. He was a member of the first state legislature. In\r\n1869 he was elected president of the New Athens College, Greensburg,\r\nKentucky, and served a short time, when he contracted the disease that\r\nafterward terminated his earthly career. Mr. Wood was a man of more\r\nthan ordinary ability, an eloquent speaker, a fluent and gifted\r\nwriter, whose influence will long be felt. He left a widow and three\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nMRS. W. H. WOOD has been a liberal contributor to magazines and the\r\nauthor of several volumes, of which a list is here appended: \"The\r\nHeart of Myrrha Lake;\" \"Into the Light of Catholicity;\" \"Hubert's\r\nWife;\" \"The Brown House at Duffield;\" \"Strayed from the Fold;\" \"Three\r\nTimes Three; or, Basil, Beatrice, Ethel;\" \"Story of Annette;\" \"Hazel\r\nGreen's Rival.\"\r\n\r\nA. DE LACY WOOD, son of Mrs. W. H. Wood, edits the Two Harbor _Iron\r\nPost_, in Lake county.\r\n\r\nP. H. WOOD, second son of Mrs. W. H. Wood, edits the Sauk Rapids _Free\r\nPress_.\r\n\r\nREV. SHERMAN HALL was born in Weathersfield, Vermont; was educated at\r\nExeter Academy, Dartmouth College and Andover Theological Seminary. He\r\nwas married to Betsey Parker in 1831, and ordained the same year as a\r\nmissionary to the Chippewa Indians at La Pointe. With them he remained\r\nuntil 1854, when he transferred his residence to Sauk Rapids and\r\norganized a Congregational church, of which he continued pastor until\r\nhis death, Sept. 1, 1859. Mr. Hall made a translation of parts of the\r\nBible into the Ojibway tongue. He was greatly beloved amongst his\r\npeople for his firm, christian demeanor and publicly recognized as a\r\nman of integrity and sound judgment. He served the people of Benton\r\ncounty as judge of probate court and county superintendent of schools.\r\n\r\nJEREMIAH RUSSELL was born in Eaton, Madison county, New York, Feb. 2,\r\n1809. He received a common school and academic education, and learned\r\nto set type in the office of the Chautauqua _Gazette_. He subsequently\r\ntaught school and worked for awhile in printing offices. Removing to\r\nPalmyra, he clerked in a store several years. In 1835 he came to\r\nMichigan, and thence to the Lake Superior country, where he\r\nsuperintended a copper mine for a couple of years, at Left Hand river,\r\nnear the head of the lake. In 1837 he came to Fort Snelling, and in\r\n1839 accompanied Frank Steele and others to St. Croix Falls, and\r\nengaged in building a saw mill. In 1840 he went to Pokegama mission as\r\ngovernment farmer and blacksmith. About 1842, at the closing up of the\r\nPokegama mission in consequence of Indian disturbances, he purchased\r\nthe old Connor trading post and farm. In 1843, with Elam Greely, he\r\nwent down the St. Croix and up the Mississippi and Rum rivers in a\r\nbirch canoe, exploring for pine timber. They found Rum river blockaded\r\nat one place a distance of three-quarters of a mile, with drifts or\r\nrafts of trees, consolidated and held together by the roots of grasses\r\nand water willows, the accumulations apparently of ages. Around this\r\nraft they made a portage, and ascended a tributary of Rum river to its\r\nsource, thence down the Kanabec or Snake river to Pokegama. In 1848\r\nMr. Russell came to Crow Wing, Minnesota, as agent for Borup & Oakes,\r\nIndian traders and fur dealers. In the autumn of 1849 he established\r\nhimself at a point two miles above Sauk Rapids, and opened up a farm\r\nof one hundred and thirty acres. At the end of four years he moved\r\ndown the river and made a land claim on the west side, including the\r\nwater power of Sauk Rapids. He owned an interest also in the water\r\npower on the east side. In 1854 he was one of the company that\r\nsurveyed and platted the village of Sauk Rapids. He established the\r\npioneer newspaper, the Sauk Rapids _Frontiersman_.\r\n\r\nMr. Russell for several years held the office of county auditor and\r\ntreasurer, and in 1849 was elected to the territorial legislature. His\r\nname appears in the list of members, but he was present only at the\r\nopening sessions, and voted for but a single measure. He had told his\r\nconstituents before his election that he would not serve. At this time\r\nhe was Democratic in politics but in later life voted the Republican\r\nticket. Mr. Russell possessed a warm, generous nature, combined with\r\nintegrity of character, which gained for him the love and esteem of\r\nhis many friends. Ever ready to extend a willing hand to those in\r\nneed, and, as far as lay in his power, to assist those in distress, he\r\nwill ever be remembered with kindly feelings by all who knew him.\r\nThough exposed to all the temptations and vicissitudes of an early\r\nsettler's life, coming in contact with all kinds of social conditions,\r\nhe never departed from the path of christian rectitude, and those with\r\nwhom he came in contact will ever remember him for his kind\r\nheartedness and gentlemanly bearing.\r\n\r\nSept. 20, 1843, he was united in marriage to Miss Sophia Oakes\r\n(daughter of the late Chas. H. Oakes), who survives him. Seven\r\nchildren were born unto them, but only three are now alive. These are\r\nMrs. W. L. Nieman, Miss Julia A. and Mr. J. A. Russell. Mr. Russell\r\ndied at his home in Sauk Rapids in 1885.\r\n\r\nEDWARD OSCAR HAMLIN was born at Bethany, Wayne county, Pennsylvania,\r\nJune 12, 1828. He received his preparatory education at his native\r\nplace; entered Hamilton College, Clinton, New York, in 1848, and\r\ngraduated in 1858, third in his class, and in three years received the\r\ndegree of A.M. He read law first at Wilkesbarre, Pennsylvania, with\r\nHon. Geo. W. Woodward (afterward one of the judges of the supreme\r\ncourt of Pennsylvania); at Honesdale, Pennsylvania, later with Earl\r\nWheeler, Esq., and was admitted to the bar Sept. 7, 1852. After\r\npracticing for two years at Honesdale, he decided to go West, and in\r\n1855 settled in Sauk Rapids. He was admitted to practice in the\r\nterritorial courts, and in 1856 was admitted to practice by the\r\nsupreme court. Judge Hamlin was elected the first mayor of the city of\r\nSt. Cloud. He was nominated by the Democratic party for governor, and\r\nsubsequently for judge of the supreme court. He was also, in 1860,\r\nappointed by Gov. Ramsey \"a regent of the University of the State of\r\nMinnesota,\" and was subsequently an efficient and zealous member of\r\nthe state board of normal instruction.\r\n\r\nSoon after the outbreak of the Rebellion, in 1861, Gov. Ramsey\r\ntendered him the commission of major of the Seventh Regiment,\r\nMinnesota Volunteers, but his eyesight being defective, he was obliged\r\nto decline it. In 1864 Judge Hamlin was chosen by the Democratic party\r\nas one of the delegates to the Democratic national convention. He was\r\nappointed as one of the committee on platform, and openly denounced,\r\nwith three others, the platform before it was adopted, because it\r\ndeclared the war for the Union a failure. Judge Hamlin was a war\r\nDemocrat, and hung out the stars and stripes over his residence in\r\nSauk Rapids, the first one in that town to do so. In 1873, being an\r\nonly child and yielding to the solicitations of his parents, Judge\r\nHamlin returned to his native county and opened an office in\r\nHonesdale. After a short residence there he removed to Bethany, which\r\nhas since been his home. He continued the practice of his profession\r\nin Honesdale until June, 1885, when failing health compelled him to\r\nretire.\r\n\r\nJudge Hamlin has been twice married. His first wife was Mary A.,\r\ndaughter of Judge Eldred, who for a quarter of a century graced the\r\nbench of Pennsylvania. She died at St. Cloud, Sept. 27, 1868. In\r\nOctober, 1870, Judge Hamlin married Ella F., daughter of E. B. Strong,\r\nEsq., for years clerk of the district court of Stearns county.\r\n\r\n\r\nMORRISON COUNTY.\r\n\r\nMorrison county is somewhat irregular in outline. It is bounded on the\r\nnorth by Crow Wing and Cass, on the east by Mille Lacs, on the south\r\nby Benton and Stearns, on the west by Stearns and Todd counties. The\r\nportion east of the Mississippi originally belonged to Benton county,\r\nand the portion on the west side to Todd county. It contains 1,139\r\nsquare miles. The eastern part is well covered with pine and hardwood\r\nforests. The west and central portions consist of oak openings and\r\nbrush prairies. The groves are interspersed with poplar. The surface\r\nis generally level, but is well drained by the Mississippi and its\r\ntributaries, mostly small streams. It has some fine lakes in the\r\nnorthern and central parts. The soil is well adapted to farming. A\r\ngranite range, an extension of the range of Sauk Rapids and St. Cloud,\r\npasses through the county.\r\n\r\nWilliam Nicholson was probably the first settler in this county. He\r\nfirst came to Swan River in 1847, in company with ten other men. They\r\nforded the Mississippi near the mouth of Swan river, made a raft and\r\nfloated down the river a few miles, where they abandoned it on account\r\nof low water, and returned south, whence they came. The next summer\r\nNicholson returned with twenty-two men, crossed the river at the same\r\nplace, and cut a road through to the Winnebago agency at Long Prairie.\r\nReturning the same year to the crossing, he found Wm. Aiken had made a\r\nclaim and was building a hotel and store on the east bank of the\r\nriver. Mr. Nicholson remained some years in the vicinity, but is now a\r\nresident of Little Falls. Wm. Aiken permanently located at Swan River\r\nin 1848, one year after Nicholson's arrival at that point. He died in\r\n1851, aged about sixty-five years. He had two Indian wives. They\r\nquarreled and fought savagely at the funeral as to which was entitled\r\nto the position of chief mourner, wife number one coming off\r\nvictorious. James Green made a squatter's claim in 1848, and built a\r\nsaw mill on the east side of the Mississippi by the island at the\r\nfalls. Wm. Knowles located at the mouth of Rabbit river in 1849. John\r\nStillwell came to Swan River in 1849. He was a carpenter and worked at\r\nhis trade until 1866, when he went into the hotel business. He now\r\nresides at Little Falls. He and Nicholson are the only old settlers of\r\nSwan River remaining in the county.\r\n\r\nAt the organization of the county in 1856, Little Falls, located on\r\nthe Mississippi a short distance above Swan River, became the county\r\nseat. The year before and the two years following were years of wild\r\nspeculation. The chief ambition of the speculators was to found a\r\ncity. During these years twenty-four village or town plats were\r\nrecorded in the office of the register of deeds in Morrison. Not all,\r\nhowever, were located within the bounds of the county, some being\r\nplatted on unsurveyed government lands. Of these towns, the only one\r\nremaining, or of note, is Fergus Falls, Otter Tail county, platted by\r\na company from Little Falls. Of the towns located in Morrison county,\r\nevery one vanished except Little Falls, though Swan River, Belle\r\nPrairie and Granite City kept up an appearance of prosperity for a\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe early history of Morrison county is enlivened by many thrilling\r\nincidents of Indian warfare, chiefly of contests between the Sioux and\r\nChippewas. The Sioux had claimed the territory from time immemorial,\r\nbut over a hundred years ago the Chippewas had driven them westward\r\nacross the Mississippi and were in possession of the soil. The tribal\r\nhostility of the two races continued to manifest itself in predatory\r\nand retaliatory raids, and from these the early settlers were often\r\nsufferers.\r\n\r\nNathan Richardson, the historian of Morrison county, an authority to\r\nwhom we are greatly indebted, says that the country was acknowledged\r\nto be Chippewa ground before and during the settlement by the whites,\r\nbut that the Sioux made frequent raids through the counties in parties\r\nof from five to twenty-five, their principal object being to possess\r\nthemselves of Chippewa scalps. The Chippewas retaliated by pursuing\r\nthe Sioux into their own prescribed limits. Mr. Richardson avers that\r\nthe Chippewas were seldom known to treat the white settlers uncivilly,\r\nwhile the Sioux would kill stock to supply their wants, for which the\r\nsettlers were left without compensation from Indians or government.\r\n\r\nThe Winnebagoes were for some years located within the bounds of Todd\r\nand Morrison counties. In 1848 Gen. Fletcher removed them from Fort\r\nAtkinson, Iowa, to Long Prairie, west side of the Mississippi; but\r\nalthough the agency was located at Long Prairie, the Indians occupied\r\nthe Swan River valley within the present limits of Morrison and Todd\r\ncounties for a period of seven years, where they engaged partly in\r\nhunting and partly in farming, having about two hundred acres under\r\ncultivation, when they became dissatisfied and were removed to the\r\nBlue Earth country.\r\n\r\nWhen the Winnebago Indians were brought to Long Prairie and the Swan\r\nRiver valley, in 1848, the government built Fort Ripley on the west\r\nbank of the Mississippi, about twenty miles above the mouth of Swan\r\nriver. The government still owns the fort and reservation around it,\r\nand keeps a garrison there. Fort Ripley, however, has other\r\nassociations than those connected with the Winnebagoes. It was\r\nnecessary to place a force here during the Indian outbreak in 1862,\r\nthe object being to overawe and hold in check the Chippewas, who were\r\nmore than suspected of an intention to make common cause with the\r\nSioux in their warfare against the whites. There the Seventh Regiment,\r\nMinnesota Volunteers, had its headquarters for a time.\r\n\r\nMorrison county was named in honor of Hon. Allen W. Morrison, who came\r\nto Minnesota some time in the '20s, and was prominent in the early\r\nhistory of the Territory. It was organized April 18, 1856, by the\r\nelection of the following county officers: Commissioners, Wm. Trask,\r\nElliott J. Kidder and W. W. Stebbins; register of deeds and clerk of\r\nboard of commissioners, Nathan Richardson; judge of probate, James\r\nFergus; sheriff, Jonathan Pugh; district attorney, W. B. Fairbanks;\r\nassessors, W. B. Tuttle and John Fry.\r\n\r\nThe first term of court was held May 15, 1856; Judge Moses Sherburne,\r\npresiding. The first deed recorded was dated June 19, 1854, conveying\r\nfrom William Shelafoo to Louis Robair the northeast quarter of the\r\nsouthwest quarter, and lots 3, 4 and 5 of section 30, township 40,\r\nrange 32.\r\n\r\nMorrison county is subdivided into the following towns: Agram, Belle\r\nPrairie, Buckman, Bellevue, Culdrum, Elmdale, Green Prairie, Little\r\nFalls, Morrill, Motley, Parker, Pierz, Pike Creek, Ripley, Swan River,\r\nand Two Rivers.\r\n\r\n\r\nLITTLE FALLS VILLAGE,\r\n\r\nThe county seat of Morrison county, is located on the east bank of the\r\nMississippi river, in sections 7, 8, 18 and 19 of township 40, range\r\n32. It derives its name from a rapid in the Mississippi river, formed\r\nby the extension across the river of the slate stone ledges of the St.\r\nLouis. The site is a prairie, sloping gently to the water's edge. The\r\nfirst survey was made in 1855, by S. M. Putnam. The village grew\r\nrapidly from the first, and in 1857 the best lots were selling for\r\n$1,000 each. Previous to 1855 the only houses in the place were two\r\ncabins, a frame building in which E. J. Kidder lived, and a school\r\nhouse. Two hotels were built that year, one by Joseph Batters, the\r\nother by W. B. Fairbanks and Nathan Richardson.\r\n\r\nThe first settlers were the Kidders, Fairbanks, Batters, Richardson,\r\nJames Green, William Sturgis, William Butler, and O. A. Churchill.\r\nJames Green came as early as 1848, and took a squatter's claim on the\r\neast bank, including the water power, and built a saw mill, but soon\r\nafter died, and the property passed into the hands of H. M. Rice and\r\nCapt. Todd, who in 1850 sold their right to Wm. Sturgis. In 1852 John\r\nM. Kidder pre-empted the mill power, transferring it to the Little\r\nFalls Company, consisting of Wm. Sturgis and Calvin Tuttle, organized\r\nin 1854 for the improvement of the falls. This company purchased\r\nabout 1,000 acres of adjoining land from the government, and in 1855\r\nmerged into a stock company with a capital of $100,000, of which the\r\noriginal company retained one-half, the remaining half being converted\r\ninto cash. The stock rose in value at one time two hundred and fifty\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\nThe company built a new dam and mills, but the revenue did not keep\r\nthe property in good condition after the expenditures. These valuable\r\nimprovements, including the dam and mills, were all swept away by high\r\nwater in 1860; the firm became bankrupt, and the valuable power became\r\nnearly worthless and entirely useless, until 1887, when a new company,\r\nknown as the Little Falls Water Power Company, was formed with a paid\r\nup capital of $600,000, which is distributed among eastern and western\r\ncapitalists. The company is now constructing very extensive works, the\r\npower of which will have a head, or fall, of twenty feet, thus making\r\nit the largest water power, next to Minneapolis, to be found in the\r\nwhole Northwest. The dam, now about completed, has cost about\r\n$200,000.\r\n\r\nSo thoroughly convinced are the people of Morrison county of the great\r\nfuture before it, that, by a majority of over 2 to 1, they voted a\r\nsubscription of $100,000 in 5 per cent bonds as a bonus to be\r\ndelivered to the company upon the completion of the work. The village\r\nof Little Falls also entered into a contract with the company,\r\nagreeing to pay annually a sum of money equal to the taxes imposed\r\nupon that corporation, and also to exempt from taxation any\r\nmanufactory using the water power for a period of five years. The\r\nimprovements under process of construction consist, first, of a dam\r\nacross the entire river, resting, however, against the head of Mill\r\nisland; second, a canal on the west side, starting from a point\r\nopposite the head of Mill island, and extending 1,000 feet down\r\nstream. This canal is 80 feet wide and 13 feet deep, is lined with a\r\nretaining wall, and provided with head gates at the upper end and with\r\na waste way at the lower end; third, a wheel house, races, and, if\r\nfound desirable, a wire rope tower for transmitting power to Mill\r\nisland and to the east shore. Basing the rental of this power on that\r\nof the water power at Lowell, Massachusetts, it would be worth\r\n$150,000 per annum. The officers of the company are W. H. Breyfogle,\r\nof Louisville, Kentucky, president; M. M. Williams, of Little Falls,\r\nsecretary and treasurer.\r\n\r\nLittle Falls was incorporated as a village in 1880, Louis Houde\r\npresident of the board. The improvement of the water power has given a\r\nstrong impulse to the prosperity of the village. It numbers now\r\namongst its public buildings a court house, school house having rooms\r\nfor six grades, two Catholic churches, one Congregational, one\r\nEpiscopal and one Methodist church. In Belle Prairie, four miles\r\ndistant, there is also a Catholic church, school and a nunnery.\r\n\r\nA bridge, built at a cost of $24,000, crosses the Mississippi at this\r\npoint. The bridge is 400 feet in length. The Little Falls & Dakota\r\nrailroad, a branch of the Northern Pacific, is finished from Little\r\nFalls to Morris in Stevens county, a distance of 85 miles. In addition\r\nto the mills connected with the water power there is also a steam saw\r\nmill.\r\n\r\n\r\nROYALTON VILLAGE\r\n\r\nIs located in an oak grove on the Northern Pacific railroad, twenty\r\nmiles above Sauk Rapids, and ten below Little Falls near the south\r\nline of Morrison county. It includes some lands in Benton county.\r\nPlatte river flows through the village and furnishes a water power of\r\n8 feet head, improved by a dam, supplying a flour mill which has a\r\ncapacity of 250 barrels per day, and a saw mill with a capacity of\r\n40,000 feet. There is 65 feet fall on the Platte within five miles of\r\nRoyalton below, and 45 feet above the village, yet unimproved. James\r\nHill, of Baldwin, St. Croix county, Wisconsin, with Putney and Nobles\r\nerected the flour mill, John D. Logan, the proprietor, having donated\r\nthe water power and grounds for manufacturing purposes. Mr. Logan has\r\na steam saw mill with a capacity of 30,000 feet per day. The Platte is\r\nspanned by an iron bridge. The village has, in addition to its mills,\r\na weekly newspaper, a large elevator, a good graded school with six\r\ndepartments, and three churches, Episcopal, Presbyterian and\r\nMethodist. It was surveyed and platted in 1879 by John D. Logan, and\r\nincorporated in 1887. The first officers were: President, J. D. Logan;\r\nrecorder, John Holmes; trustees. J. C. Wakefield, J. C. Higgins, R.\r\nLambert; treasurer, G. E. Putney; justices, Robert Brown, Wm. Jones;\r\nconstables, Wm. Roller, C. O. Brannen.\r\n\r\nPETER ROY, a mixed blood of French and Chippewa parentage, was born in\r\nRainy Lake, in 1829. He was educated at La Pointe, Wisconsin. At the\r\nage of twenty-one he came to the agency at Long lake, where he served\r\nas interpreter until 1853, when he was elected to the territorial\r\nlegislature. He opened a farm at Belle Prairie in 1855; became a\r\nmember of the state legislatures of 1860 and 1862. In 1866 he removed\r\nto Little Falls, where he resided until his death, in 1883. He was a\r\nman of large frame and of generous impulses, liberal and open-handed,\r\neven to his own pecuniary disadvantage.\r\n\r\nWM. STURGIS came to this county from Big Meadow, Sherburne county,\r\nMinnesota, in 1850, and located at Little Falls, where he put a ferry\r\nacross the Mississippi. He also laid out a town and built a saw and\r\ngrist mill at the mouth of Little Elk river. He was a member of the\r\nterritorial council from Crow Wing and Sauk Rapids precincts in 1849\r\nand 1851; of the territorial house in 1856, and of the constitutional\r\nconvention, Democratic wing, in 1857. Some years later he removed,\r\nfirst to Montana, and then to Sturgis, Michigan.\r\n\r\nJAMES FERGUS was born in the parish of Glassford, Lanarkshire,\r\nScotland, Oct. 8, 1813. His parents were well-to-do farmers, and gave\r\nhim a good education along with excellent moral and religious\r\ntraining. In his youth he was noted for his thoroughness in whatever\r\nwork he undertook, and his fondness for good books. At the age of\r\nnineteen years he came to America to improve his fortunes, locating\r\nfirst in Canada, where he spent three years, and learned the trade of\r\na millwright. Becoming involved in some political troubles just before\r\nthe outbreak of the Papineau Rebellion, he left Canada for the United\r\nStates, and spent a couple of years in Green Bay and Milwaukee,\r\nWisconsin, and at Chicago and Buffalo Grove, Illinois, going thence to\r\nIowa, and thence to Moline, Illinois, where he found employment in the\r\nmachine shops and foundries of Buford, Sears & Wheelock. In 1854 he\r\nremoved to Little Falls, and in company with C. A. Tuttle built a dam\r\nacross the Mississippi and platted the village. He subsequently owned\r\nthe site of Fergus Falls, now a thriving city, that has done well in\r\nassuming his name. In 1862 he drove his own team from Little Falls to\r\nBannock, then in Idaho, now in Montana Territory. He became prominent\r\nin territorial affairs; was influential in the organization of the new\r\ncounty of Madison, and held many positions of trust and\r\nresponsibility. He was the commissioner appointed for Madison county,\r\nserved two terms in the Montana legislature, and was a member of the\r\nconstitutional convention of 1887. At one time he lived in Lewis and\r\nClark counties; he now resides in Meagher county, near Fort Maginnis,\r\nwhere he is engaged in stock raising.\r\n\r\nHis main characteristics are an aptitude for mechanical enterprises, a\r\nsturdy independence of thought, a strict integrity of purpose, and an\r\nardent love of study and good books. He is a typical pioneer, and in\r\nthe mellow light of his declining days has the respect and love of his\r\ncontemporaries to a remarkable degree. He is the first president of\r\nthe Montana Pioneer Association, a position which he worthily fills.\r\n\r\nMr. Fergus was married March 16, 1845, to Parnelia Dillin, of\r\nJefferson county, New York. Mrs. Fergus died Oct. 6, 1887. He has one\r\nson and three daughters, the latter married and living in Montana.\r\n\r\nNATHAN RICHARDSON was born in Wayne county, New York, in 1829. He was\r\nraised on a farm, educated at Romeo, Michigan, and came to Little\r\nFalls in 1855. He served as register of deeds for Morrison county\r\neight years, and was postmaster eleven years. He also served as county\r\nsurveyor and county attorney, having been admitted to the bar in 1877.\r\nHe was notary public twenty-five years. He was a representative in the\r\nMinnesota legislatures of 1867, 1872 and 1878. During his first term\r\nin the house he represented nineteen counties, nearly one-half the\r\nterritory of the State. He served as judge of probate two terms. Mr.\r\nRichardson has prepared, by order of the board of county\r\ncommissioners, and published in the local papers, a complete and\r\nvaluable history of Morrison county, to which we are greatly indebted.\r\nHe was married to Mary A. Roof in 1857, and has a family of three sons\r\nand two daughters.\r\n\r\nMOSES LA FOND, a Canadian Frenchman, came to Morrison county in 1855,\r\nand located at Little Falls, where he commenced as a teamster for the\r\nLittle Falls Manufacturing Company. He found more lucrative\r\nemployment, became a butcher, then a merchant, then a legislator,\r\nhaving been elected a representative in the legislature of 1874.\r\n\r\nO. A. CHURCHILL.--Orlando A. Churchill was born in Windsor county,\r\nVermont, in 1825. He came to Illinois in 1843, and to Little Falls in\r\n1855, where he engaged in mercantile pursuits. He was elected to the\r\nlegislature of 1858, but did not serve, as no session of the\r\nlegislature was held that year. He served several years as auditor of\r\nMorrison county. He removed to St. Paul a few years ago, and later to\r\nCalifornia, but is now again a resident of Little Falls.\r\n\r\nJOHN M. KIDDER made a claim of government land on the east side of the\r\nMississippi, on the site of Little Falls. He died in 1855, before the\r\nland was entered, and the claim was purchased by Wm. Sturgis, a\r\nson-in-law of Mr. Kidder, and by him sold to the Little Falls Company.\r\nElliott J., a son of John M. Kidder, is still a resident of Little\r\nFalls.\r\n\r\nWARREN KOBE located at Royalton in 1880 and built an elevator, store\r\nand first class hotel. Mr. Kobe is a public spirited citizen and has\r\nexpended much in improving the town.\r\n\r\nOLA K. BLACK, of Norwegian birth, was one of the first settlers.\r\n\r\nIRA W. BOUCH came from Buchanan county, Iowa, in 1880, and opened the\r\nfirst store in Royalton.\r\n\r\nROBERT RUSSELL, living on a farm near the village, came from Scotland\r\nto America in 1850 and settled here in 1853. Mr. Russell died in July,\r\n1862; Mrs. Russell died in 1876. Three sons and five daughters survive\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nPETER A. GREEN, a farmer, pre-empted one hundred and sixty acres in\r\n1854, a part of which is surveyed into town lots. He built the second\r\nbuilding on the town site. Mr. Green was born in 1817, in Green\r\ncounty, New York, where he married. He died January, 1884. His widow\r\nand two sons survive him.\r\n\r\nRODOLPHUS D. KINNEY was the first settler on the town site of\r\nRoyalton, in 1854, erected the first house and was the first\r\npostmaster, in 1856. Mr. Kinney gave the name of Royalton to the post\r\noffice, the name being that of his birthplace, in the state of\r\nVermont. He was born in 1828; had good educational advantages in youth\r\nand attended Fairmount Theological Seminary in Cincinnati; was an\r\nassociate of the early Presbyterian missions and was the first school\r\nteacher in Morrison county, in 1851 and 1852, at Belle Prairie. He was\r\nmarried in St. Paul in 1852. His eldest son, Jonathan, was born in\r\n1853. One daughter lives in Alabama and his youngest son is a\r\nphysician at Royalton.\r\n\r\nJOHN D. LOGAN came to Minnesota from Philadelphia in 1855 and located\r\nin Hastings; served during the war in Company G. First Minnesota\r\nRegular Volunteers. In 1879 he came to Royalton and devoted himself to\r\nthe development of the water power and the building up of the village.\r\nHe has a wife and three children.\r\n\r\n\r\nCROW WING COUNTY.\r\n\r\nThe county of Crow Wing was organized in 1857. Prior to this period it\r\nwas included in Benton and other counties. It now includes eleven\r\nwhole and eight fractional townships in townships 43 to 47, ranges 28\r\nto 31, inclusive. The Mississippi river bounds it on the west and\r\nnorthwest, Aitkin county on the east and Morrison on the south. Its\r\nsoil ranges from a light sandy to a dark loam, with clay subsoil, and\r\nthe timber includes the pines and the hardwoods common to the\r\nlatitude. There are also fine meadows and burr oak openings. It is\r\nwatered by the tributaries of the Mississippi and its surface is\r\ndotted with lakes. It is well adapted to stock raising and\r\nagriculture.\r\n\r\nC. H. Beaulieu appears to have been the first white man to locate\r\nwithin its boundaries. He established a trading post as early as 1837,\r\nnear the mouth of Crow Wing river. His successors in trade were Allen\r\nMorrison and Donald McDonald. Philip Beaupre was here in 1844. When\r\nFort Ripley was built S. B. Olmstead, with his family, built a house\r\nand improved a farm opposite the fort on the east bank of the\r\nMississippi. Mr. Olmstead came from Prairie du Chien in 1849. While\r\nresiding here he served as a member of the second, fifth and sixth\r\nterritorial legislatures, and in 1854 was elected president of the\r\ncouncil. After living here several years, he removed to Texas, and\r\ndied there some years ago. Mr. Olmstead kept a hotel and managed to\r\nsecure most of the hay, beef and wood contracts for the fort. Henry M.\r\nRice had a trading post at one time at Crow Wing village, about eight\r\nmiles above the fort. John H. Fairbanks ran a ferry at the village.\r\nOther settlers were Wallace Bean, Henry Whipple, F. M. Campbell, W. B.\r\nWakefield, Ed. Lyndes, Albert Fuller, Thomas Cathcart, Daniel S.\r\nMooers, S. C. Abbe, and members of the Beaulieu family. James A.\r\nParish was the first justice of the peace. John McGillis, who lived at\r\nCrow Wing in 1853, was the second and served about fifteen years. In\r\n1856 the first farm was opened on government land, not far from Crow\r\nWing village, by Wallace Bean. The second farm was taken by David\r\nMcArthur, a Canadian, originally from Scotland. George Van Valkenburg\r\nopened a blacksmith shop at Crow Wing in 1856, lived there two years\r\nand was then employed as government blacksmith by the Indian\r\ndepartment, and served as such for twelve years. Crow Wing county was\r\norganized in 1857, with the following board of officers: County\r\nauditor, C. H. Beaulieu; register of deeds, F. M. Campbell; county\r\ntreasurer, Robert Fairbanks; county commissioners, J. H. Fairbanks,\r\nAllen Morrison, S. B. Olmstead; judge of probate court, Dennis Shaff.\r\nThe county organization took effect Jan. 1, 1858. The county was\r\nattached for judicial purposes, first to Ramsey, and then to Morrison\r\ncounty. F. W. Peake came to Crow Wing in 1858, and opened a trading\r\npost, and was afterward one of the mercantile firm of Peake &\r\nWakefield. Rev. E. S. Peake, an Episcopal clergyman, came to Crow Wing\r\nabout the same time, built a church and remained as rector till the\r\nbreaking out of the war, when he accepted the chaplaincy of a\r\nWisconsin regiment. After the war he removed to California, and\r\ncarried on a mission a few years, but later returned to Minnesota and\r\nis now stationed at Detroit. Rev. Francis Pierz, a Catholic priest,\r\nofficiated at Crow Wing and Belle Prairie until 1870, when he returned\r\nto his home in Austria.\r\n\r\nThe first district court was held at Crow Wing in 1871, J. M. McKelvey\r\nofficiating as judge, Chas. Beaulieu as clerk of court, and Wm. Wood\r\nas sheriff.\r\n\r\nSoon after the county organization was abandoned, to be reresumed in\r\n1870 by legislative enactment. The county officers at the organization\r\nwere: Commissioners, Wallace Bean, Henry Whipple and F. W. Peake;\r\ntreasurer, E. B. Snyder; auditor, J. W. Campbell; clerk of court,\r\nChas. H. Beaulieu; sheriff, Wm. Wood.\r\n\r\n\r\nMURDERERS LYNCHED.\r\n\r\nIn 1871, Ellen, daughter of David McArthur, living near Crow Wing\r\nvillage, was murdered by Indians. The murderers were arrested and\r\nplaced in jail at Brainerd, from which they were taken by a mob and\r\nhanged.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRAINERD\r\n\r\nIs situated on the east bank of the Mississippi, and is a prosperous\r\ncity. The settlement commenced with the opening of the Northern\r\nPacific railroad. This road has a branch from Brainerd to St. Paul.\r\nThe railroad company have made Brainerd headquarters for repairing\r\nshops; have expended large amounts in improvements, and employ in\r\ntheir business here nearly 1,000 men. The first through train arrived\r\nat Brainerd March 11, 1871.\r\n\r\nIn 1870 several claims were made for purposes of speculation, and\r\nafterward sold to Mrs. Hester Gilman, of St. Cloud, and other parties,\r\nbut the greater part of the city site was purchased of the government\r\nin 1870, by Hester Gilman and Thomas H. Campbell. The Lake Superior &\r\nPuget Sound Company, organized under the laws of Maine, and duly\r\nauthorized by the laws of Minnesota, purchased Gilman's and Campbell's\r\nclaims and made the original survey and plat of the town on Sept 25,\r\n1871. The name, Brainerd, was given to the new town in honor of Mrs.\r\nBrainerd Swift, wife of the first president of the Northern Pacific\r\nroad. In 1883 a new survey was made by Heinze Brothers. The site was a\r\nhandsome plain, originally covered with prince pine trees, many of\r\nwhich were left standing as ornamental trees.\r\n\r\nAmong the first settlers we find the names of Charles Darby, E. H.\r\nBly, L. P. White, W. P. Spalding, W. W. Hartley, Stuart Seely, F. W.\r\nPeake, S. W. Taylor, E. B. Lynde, John Bishop, T. C. Barnes, and John\r\nMartin. The first permanent dwelling, a log house, was built by\r\nCharles Darby, the next was built by Stuart Seely, and the third by L.\r\nP. White. E. H. Bly built the first store. The Headquarters Hotel,\r\nsubsequently destroyed by fire, was built in 1871. Many of the\r\nbuildings of ancient Crow Wing were moved to Brainerd. The Leland\r\nHouse was built in 1871-2; the Merchants in 1879. The post office was\r\nestablished in 1871, with S. W. Thayer as postmaster. The county seat\r\nwas removed to this place in 1871, and a court house and jail built by\r\nL. P. White, at an expense of $971.60. The first marriage, that of\r\nJoseph Gronden and Miss Darby, occurred in 1870. A city charter was\r\nobtained Jan. 11, 1873. The following were the first officers: Mayor,\r\nEber H. Bly; aldermen, L. P. White, M. Tuttle, W. S. Heathcote, Wm.\r\nMurphy, T. X. Goulett; president of the council, L. P. White.\r\n\r\nBrainerd has a court house, built at a cost of $45,000, and school\r\nbuildings worth $45,000. The Northern Pacific depot and shops were\r\nbuilt at a cost of $500,000, and the Northern Pacific sanitarium at a\r\ncost of $35,000. The sanitarium is a hospital for the sick or disabled\r\nemployes of the entire line of road, and is supported by monthly\r\ninstallments from the employes. Dr. Beger is superintendent. Brainerd\r\nhas one steam saw mill with a capacity of 12,000,000 feet per annum,\r\nanother with a capacity of 3,000,000 feet, and many fine business\r\nblocks and tasteful residences. It has also electric lights, water\r\nworks, and street cars, and is making rapid progress as a city.\r\n\r\nIn 1886 a charter was obtained by Charles F. Kindred & Co. to build a\r\ndam across the Mississippi. The dam has been completed at a cost of\r\n$125,000. It has a head of 20 feet, with sufficient flow to secure\r\n25,000 horse power, and a boomage overflowing 3,000 acres, forming a\r\nreservoir 12 miles in length, with side lakes, the whole capable of\r\nholding 1,000,000,000 feet of logs. The whole city machinery,\r\nincluding electric lights, water works, street cars, and Northern\r\nPacific railroad shops, will be attached to this water power. Crow\r\nWing county contributed $50,000 in bonds to the building of this dam.\r\nBrainerd has an opera house, and is well supplied with churches, the\r\nCatholics, Presbyterians, Baptists, Congregationalists, Episcopalians,\r\nLutherans, and Methodists having organizations and buildings.\r\n\r\nL. P. WHITE was born in Vermont in 1811. He was self educated. He was\r\nmarried in Vermont, came to Chicago in 1858, and engaged in\r\nrailroading until arriving at Brainerd, in 1870, where he built the\r\nfirst frame house. His wife was the first white woman resident of the\r\ncity. Since locating at Brainerd, Mr. White has been the acting agent\r\nof the Lake Superior & Puget Sound Company, which has laid out all the\r\ntown sites from Northern Pacific Junction to Moorhead with the\r\nexception of Detroit.\r\n\r\nALLEN MORRISON was one of a family of twelve, seven boys and five\r\ngirls. His father was born in Scotland, but emigrated to Canada, where\r\nhe died in 1812. Two of the boys were in the English Navy, and killed\r\nat the battle of Trafalgar, in Egypt. William Morrison, a brother of\r\nAllen, and several years his senior, was among the early explorers of\r\nNorthern Minnesota, having visited the Territory as early as 1800, and\r\nwas one of the party who discovered Lake Itasca, the source of the\r\nMississippi river. Allen's first visit to this region was in 1820,\r\nwhen he came to Fond du Lac, as a trader in what was then known as the\r\n\"Northern Outfit.\" For several years he was associated with his\r\nbrother William in the Fond du Lac department, during which time he\r\nwas stationed at Sandy Lake, Leech Lake, Red Lake, Mille Lacs, and\r\nCrow Wing, and when the Indians were removed to White Earth, went\r\nthere also, and remained until his death. In 1826 he was married to\r\nMiss Charlotte Chaboullier, who died at Crow Wing in the fall of 1872.\r\nShe was a daughter of a member of the old Northwestern Fur Company,\r\nwho was a trader on the Saskatchewan, and died in Canada in 1812. Mr.\r\nMorrison was the father of eleven children. Caroline, now in Brainerd,\r\nwas married to Chris. Grandelmyer in April, 1864. Rachel resides with\r\nher sister, Mrs. Grandelmyer. John J. and Allen, at White Earth; Mary,\r\nthe eldest, now Mrs. J. R. Sloan, at St. Cloud; and Louisa, now Mrs.\r\nJohn Bromley, at Northern Pacific Junction. Mr. Morrison died on the\r\ntwenty-eighth of November, 1878, and was buried at White Earth, in the\r\nhistoric valley where he had passed so many eventful years. His name,\r\nhowever, will not perish, nor his virtues be forgotten. In the first\r\nterritorial legislature he represented the district embracing the\r\nvoting precincts of Sauk Rapids and Crow Wing, and when the present\r\ncounty of Morrison was set off, the legislature named it in honor of\r\nthis esteemed veteran pioneer.\r\n\r\nCHARLES F. KINDRED, an active, enterprising citizen of Brainerd, is\r\ndoing for his adopted city all that one man can do. Mr. Kindred, for\r\nmany years after his arrival in Minnesota, was a trusted agent of the\r\nNorthern Pacific Railroad Company, and while in their employ acquired\r\na thorough knowledge of the resources of North Minnesota, which he\r\nuses to the best interest of the section in which he has made his\r\nhome. He is at present superintending the building of the Kindred\r\ndam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nAITKIN COUNTY.\r\n\r\nThis county consists of an oblong section, six towns in width, lying\r\nbetween Mille Lacs and Kanabec counties on the south, and Itasca on\r\nthe north. It is a heavily timbered region, upon which the lumberman\r\nhas drawn for hundreds of millions of feet of lumber, with but little\r\napparent diminution in the quantity of the supply. The whole surface\r\nis dotted with lakes and variegated with natural meadows. The southern\r\nportion of the county affords good farming lands. Mille Lacs, in the\r\nsouthern part of the county, is the largest lake, and settlements have\r\nalready been made along its shores. Sandy lake is second in size. It\r\nlies on the great portage route from Winnipeg, by way of St. Louis\r\nriver to Lake Superior, and has been a noted point on that route for\r\ntwo hundred years. The missions of the Jesuits, and later, of the\r\nPresbyterians and Methodists, had been located here and abandoned. The\r\nfur trader and the Indian trader have made their headquarters here.\r\nSandy lake has become historic. The county contains about one hundred\r\nand three townships, which are drained chiefly by the Mississippi and\r\nits tributaries. The Mississippi is navigable from Aitkin to Pokegama\r\nfalls, a distance of over one hundred miles.\r\n\r\nAitkin county was created May 23, 1857, but was not organized until\r\nJuly 30, 1872. The first officers chosen were: County commissioners,\r\nNathaniel Tibbetts, chairman; Wm. Hallstrom, Wm. Wade; treasurer, Geo.\r\nClapp; register of deeds, Wm. Hallstrom; auditor, W. E. Crowell;\r\nsheriff, James W. Tibbetts. That part of the county including the\r\nvillage of Aitkin was organized into a town in 1873; N. Tibbetts,\r\nchairman. The Northern Pacific railroad passes through six townships\r\nof this county, namely: townships 27 and 28, range 22 to 27,\r\ninclusive. While the road was in process of building in 1870,\r\nNathaniel Tibbetts made a claim where the village of Aitkin now\r\nstands, and built the first house, a hotel known as the Ojibway House,\r\nand the next spring built the Aitkin House. He moved his family here\r\nin 1471. He was appointed the first postmaster at the organization of\r\nthe county. The county and village of Aitkin were named after Wm. A.\r\nAitkin, who was a prominent trader on the Upper Mississippi for a\r\nnumber of years.\r\n\r\n\r\nAITKIN VILLAGE.\r\n\r\nAitkin was made the county seat at the organization of the county. It\r\nis pleasantly situated on the west branch of Ripple creek, near the\r\neast branch of the Mississippi. It is now a prosperous and thriving\r\nvillage with heavy mercantile establishments, two first class hotels,\r\na good school house, and pleasant homes. One newspaper, the Aitkin\r\n_Age_, is published here. Warren Potter, Richard Mills, William Wade\r\nand George Jenkins are early citizens. In 1873 Capt. Houghton built a\r\nsteamer, called the Pokegama, to run from Aitkin to Pokegama Falls.\r\nThis steamer was burned in 1878. Capt. Houghton replaced it with a new\r\nboat called the City of Aitkin, which still plies the Mississippi\r\nriver between the points named.\r\n\r\nPokegama Falls is a headquarters for lumbermen and a place for general\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nWM. A. AITKEN.--The date and place of Mr. Aitkin's nativity are not\r\npositively known. He came to the Chippewa country when a boy of\r\nfifteen, as servant to a trader named John Drew, and in time became a\r\nsuccessful and well known trader. He died at Sandy Lake in 1851. His\r\nlife, in common with that of the early traders, was adventurous. He\r\nwitnessed many stirring scenes, among them the battle of Stillwater\r\nRavine, in 1839. Although raised among the Indians, and continually on\r\nthe frontier, he was noted for his urbanity and geniality, and is well\r\nspoken of by the early explorers.\r\n\r\nALFRED AITKIN, son of the foregoing, was killed by a Chippewa Indian\r\nat Cass lake in 1836. He had stolen the wife of the Indian, and\r\nrefusing to return her to the enraged husband, was shot by him. The\r\nmurderer was arrested, taken to Prairie du Chien for trial, tried\r\nbefore Judge Drum's court and acquitted.\r\n\r\nNATHANIEL TIBBETTS was born in New Sharon, Maine, March 21, 1824.\r\nWhile a mere boy he moved to Piscataquis county, and in 1845 came to\r\nPlover, Wisconsin, and two years later to Stillwater, Minnesota. He\r\nengaged in lumbering until 1850, when he moved to St. Anthony, and\r\nsoon afterward made a claim at the mouth of Elk river, then in Benton\r\ncounty, where he remained until the Civil War, when he enlisted in\r\nCompany A, Eighth Minnesota, of which company he was commissioned\r\nfirst lieutenant, and was afterward appointed regimental\r\nquartermaster. He was mustered out with his regiment at the close of\r\nthe war, when he returned to his home at Elk River, and resumed his\r\nold business of lumbering. In 1870 he was engaged in the preliminary\r\nsurvey of the Northern Pacific railroad, and located the same year at\r\nAitkin, of which village he was the pioneer, building the first house\r\nand barn, keeping the first hotel and serving as the first postmaster.\r\nHe served four years as county commissioner. He has also served as\r\nregister of deeds and sheriff. Ten years after his location at Aitkin\r\nhe removed to Morrison county, where he now resides. His health is\r\nsomewhat impaired from the exposure and fatigue of army life.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARLTON COUNTY.\r\n\r\nCarlton county lies between St. Louis county on the north, Pine on the\r\nsouth, Douglas county, Wisconsin, on the east and Aitkin on the west,\r\nand contains twenty-four townships. It is abundantly watered by the\r\nSt. Louis river and its many tributaries on the northeast, by the\r\ntributaries of the Nemadji and Kettle rivers on the south. It is well\r\ntimbered with pine and hardwoods. The St. Louis river affords one of\r\nthe finest water powers in the Northwest. The rapids of this stream\r\nextend from the falls at Cloquet to Fond du Lac, a distance of twelve\r\nmiles. The channel is rocky, the rocks being of a trappean or slaty\r\nformation, not easily worn by the water, and capable of furnishing\r\ngood foundations for dams and mills. The first settlers were A. K.\r\nLovejoy, Cephas Bradley, Joseph Meyers, Sexton Lyons, and some others.\r\nMr. Lovejoy died at Thomson, Feb. 11, 1888, aged sixty-three years,\r\nleaving a wife. They had been the parents of twenty-four children,\r\ntwelve pairs of twins. The county was named in honor of R. B. Carlton,\r\nwho was a representative in the first state legislature. Mr. Carlton\r\ndied at Fond du Lac, Sept. 10, 1863.\r\n\r\nThe county was organized in 1858, and the county seat located at Twin\r\nLakes, but changed by act of legislature to Thomson. It is subdivided\r\ninto five towns, Knife Falls, Mahtowa, Moose Lake, Thomson, and Twin\r\nLakes. It has a well defined slate stone range running from northeast\r\nto southwest. The same range crops out at Little Falls, Morrison\r\ncounty.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMSON.\r\n\r\nThe village of Thomson, the county seat of Carlton county, is located\r\non the St. Louis river. The Northern Pacific railroad crosses at this\r\npoint. A. M. Miller erected a steam saw mill here in 1873. The mill\r\nhas a capacity of 100,000 feet per day, and has been a profitable\r\nenterprise. A. K. Lovejoy operates a saw mill six miles northwest,\r\nwhich has a capacity of 35,000 feet. The village of Thomson has a good\r\ngraded school with two departments.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLOQUET,\r\n\r\nLocated on the St. Louis river, was surveyed and platted in 1871. In\r\n1878 Charles D. Harwood erected a steam saw mill at this point with a\r\ncapacity of 50,000 feet. This was the beginning of a thriving\r\nmanufacturing village. In 1883 the Knife Falls Lumber Company rebuilt\r\nthe Harwood mill, increasing its capacity to 180,000 feet per day. In\r\n1884 the property was transferred to Renwick, Crossett & Co. James\r\nPaine, McNair and others built a water power saw mill in 1880, with a\r\ncapacity of 100,000 feet per day. The C. N. Nelson Company, in 1880,\r\nbuilt two steam saw mills with a capacity of 350,000 feet per day. A\r\npost office was established in 1879; C. D. Harwood, postmaster. The\r\nvillage was platted and incorporated in 1882; William P. Allen was the\r\nfirst president of the council. It has two newspapers, the _Pine Knot\r\nJournal_, established by Ed. Gottry and J. H. Page in 1884, and the\r\n_Industrial Vidette_, established in 1887. It contains three church\r\norganizations with good buildings, the Catholic, Methodist and\r\nPresbyterian.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOOSE LAKE STATION,\r\n\r\nOn the St. Paul & Duluth railroad, is surrounded by a good farming\r\ncountry, and is a pretty, prosperous village. It has a post office,\r\nabout sixty dwellings and a saw mill.\r\n\r\n\r\nBARNUM STATION,\r\n\r\nOn the line of the same road, contains a post office, a saw mill with\r\na capacity of about 50,000 feet daily, a few fine residences, with\r\nfine farms adjoining.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAHTOWA STATION,\r\n\r\nOn the same road, has a saw mill and about twenty dwellings. An\r\nextensive stock farm is located here.\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTH PACIFIC JUNCTION\r\n\r\nIs situated on the St. Louis river, at the junction of the St. Paul &\r\nDuluth and Northern Pacific railroads. There are about one hundred\r\nbuildings here including a large saw mill built by Paine & Co., having\r\na capacity of 10,000,000 feet per annum; one school house, one church,\r\nand hotels, stores, shops and dwellings. The village was organized in\r\n1881; Cephas Bradley, president.\r\n\r\nFRANCIS ASBURY WATKINS is a native of the state of New Hampshire. He\r\nwas born in 1853; came to Baraboo, Wisconsin, in 1866, to North\r\nPacific Junction in 1881; was married to Anna Wicks, of Pine City,\r\nMinnesota, in 1882, and was admitted to practice law in 1883. He is a\r\ngraduate of Lawrence University, Appleton, Wisconsin. He has served as\r\nauditor of Carlton county four years.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. LOUIS COUNTY.\r\n\r\nSt. Louis county takes its name from St. Louis river, the river itself\r\nhaving been named by some of the early French travelers or Jesuit\r\nmissionaries, possibly by Duluth or Buade.\r\n\r\nThe county is bounded on the north by Rainy lake and the British\r\nboundary, on the east by Lake county, on the south by Lake Superior,\r\nSt. Louis river and Carlton, and on the west by Aitkin county. The\r\nsurface is variegated, much of it being broken with deep ravines. It\r\nis well watered by streams tributary to Rainy lake and Superior, and\r\nby innumerable small lakes. Portions of it are heavily timbered with\r\npines and hardwoods, and the northern portion is traversed by a rich\r\nmineral belt extending through the Vermillion Lake region. The\r\nsettlements are chiefly along the shores of Lake Superior and St.\r\nLouis river, and on the shores of Vermillion lake. The falls and\r\nrapids of St. Louis river are noted for their wildness and grandeur.\r\n\r\nThe scenery on its northern boundary, including the Dalles of the\r\nRainy Lake waters, is not surpassed or even equaled at any point east\r\nof the Rocky mountains. The geological formation consists largely of\r\nprimitive or igneous rocks, trappean, basaltic and granite, and the\r\nscenery has a peculiarly grand and sombre appearance. Notwithstanding\r\nthe igneous character of the formation there is much excellent farming\r\nland on plains and intervales, while the more abrupt and rocky\r\nportions are rich in iron and the precious metals. The region about\r\nVermillion lake has become a centre of mining operations. The region\r\nis rich in iron ores. Gold has also been discovered. A mineral region\r\nabounding in gold, silver and iron extends from Vermillion lake to\r\nThunder Bay. St. Louis county was organized in 1856. The territorial\r\ngovernor appointed the following officers: Clerk of district court, J.\r\nB. Culver; sheriff, J. B. Ellis; register of deeds, R. H. Barrett;\r\nauditor, J. E. Brown.\r\n\r\nThe first board of county commissioners elected were C. E. Martin,\r\nVose Palmer and Z. J. Brown. The first meeting was held at Portland,\r\nJan. 4, 1858. At an adjourned meeting held Jan. 20, 1858, the\r\ncommissioners drew a grand and petit jury. The meetings were held\r\nsometimes at Portland and sometimes at Duluth. At a meeting held April\r\n5, 1858, the county was divided into four towns--Duluth, Martin, Carp\r\nRiver and Carlton. At an adjourned meeting three assessor's districts,\r\nsix school districts and four road districts were formed. The records\r\ndo not show any previous division into districts or precincts, nor\r\ndoes the name of any clerk appear until the meeting of September 14th,\r\nwhen A. B. Robbins attests as clerk. At a meeting held Sept. 23, 1858,\r\nthe village of Oneota was established. November 1st E. H. Brown was\r\nappointed clerk in place of A. B. Robbins. November 14th a bill\r\nallowing R. H. Barrett compensation for services as clerk prior to\r\nSeptember 1st was passed. His name does not appear prior to this\r\nentry.\r\n\r\nThe records show that a court was held in 1859, S. J. R. McMillan\r\nofficiating as judge. Also that a road was made from Oneota to\r\nBuchanan and the mouth of Knife river, through Fremont, Portland and\r\nEndion, following a trail to Lester's river and across French river to\r\nMontezuma, and another from Oneota to Fond du Lac. The town of Milford\r\nis mentioned as accepting the report. The assessment for St. Louis\r\ncounty for 1859 amounted to $96,836.76. At a special meeting of the\r\ncounty commissioners held Jan. 10, 1866, a resolution was adopted\r\nasking the legislature to grant authority to St. Louis county to issue\r\n$150,000 to aid in building the Lake Superior & Mississippi railroad.\r\nThe legislature granted the request and twenty year bonds were issued.\r\n\r\nWe append a list of county commissioners to the year 1863: E. C.\r\nMartin, Vose Palmer, Zach T. Brown, 1858; E. C. Martin, Vose Palmer,\r\nW. E. Wright, 1859; W. E. Wright, S. A. Forbes, Sidney Luce, 1860; E.\r\nF. Ely, Joseph B. Culver (first meeting), 1861; E. F. Ely, Harvey\r\nFargo, Levi B. Coffrey (second meeting), 1861; E. F. Ely, R. B.\r\nCarlton, H. Fargo, 1862; H. Fargo, R. B. Carlton, E. G. Swanstrom,\r\n1863.\r\n\r\nNames of villages that appear in the old records of the board have\r\nentirely disappeared. Those villages nearest to Duluth have been\r\nabsorbed by that vigorous young city. We find a record, bearing date\r\n1859, authorizing an election to decide upon the question of the\r\nremoval of the county seat from Duluth to Port Byron. There is no\r\nrecord of the result of the election, nor is Port Byron found in a\r\nrecent map.\r\n\r\n\r\nDULUTH.\r\n\r\nThe site of Duluth was visited as long ago as 1659, by two adventurous\r\nFrenchmen, Grosselier and Redission. This was twenty-one years prior\r\nto the coming of Greyson Duluth, in whose honor the city of Duluth was\r\nnamed two hundred years later. Capt. Duluth visited the western end of\r\nthe lake in 1680. Three or four years later Jean Duluth, a brother of\r\nthe captain, established two trading posts, one at the mouth of Pigeon\r\nriver, the other on Minnesota Point. Le Sueur followed in 1683,\r\naccompanied by a French surveyor, Franquelin, who made a fairly\r\ncorrect map of the region. The attraction to the early voyageurs was\r\nthe rich furs to be obtained in the wild regions adjacent. The great\r\nAmerican Fur Company early established posts along the northern shore\r\nof Lake Superior, and later the Astor Fur Company made its\r\nnorthwestern headquarters at Fond du Lac, a few miles above the\r\npresent site of Duluth. Nothing was done toward permanent settlement\r\nuntil about the year 1854, when the tide of immigration set in toward\r\nthe head of the lake, and it became evident that here was to rise\r\ncities of no mean importance, one upon the western shore of the lake,\r\nrising from the base of Minnesota Point, and the other Superior City,\r\nacross the gleaming waters of St. Louis bay.\r\n\r\nFor several years the growth of Duluth was slow, and sometimes its\r\nfortunes seemed on the wane, but the construction of a railroad to St.\r\nPaul, completed in 1870, and a sudden influx of capital consequent\r\nupon this new outlet of trade, and more than all this, the proposed\r\nconstruction of the great Northern Pacific railroad, gave a new\r\nimpetus to the growth of the city. The three years succeeding were\r\nyears of great activity and progress. The population increased from\r\n3,000 to 5,000, and many of the finer older buildings of the city were\r\nconstructed. The canal was cut through Minnesota Point, thus giving to\r\nDuluth the most magnificent harbor on the lake, if not in the world.\r\n\r\nIn 1873 the failure of Jay Cooke, who had largely contributed the\r\nmeans for the construction of the Northern Pacific railroad, caused a\r\nfinancial depression similar in its effects to that of 1857. Banks\r\nfailed, merchants became bankrupt, and the population of the city was\r\nreduced to 1,300 souls. The \"hard times\" lasted until some time in\r\n1878, when the opening up of the great wheat fields in the Red River\r\nvalley, and the completion of the Northern Pacific railroad, again\r\nbrought prosperity to the more than half deserted city. The population\r\nincreased in 1878 from 1,300 to 2,200 souls. Two years later the\r\ncensus showed 3,470; and a year later, 7,800. In 1882 the population\r\nhad increased to 12,000; in 1883 to 14,000; in 1884 to 16,690; in 1885\r\nto 18,036, and in 1886 to 26,000 souls.\r\n\r\nDuluth has now a well organized board of trade, produce exchange and\r\nchamber of commerce. It has four banks, the American Exchange, Duluth\r\nNational, Merchants National, and Bell & Eyster's. These banks had, in\r\n1886, an aggregate capital of $300,000, with deposits of $2,034,281,\r\namounts greatly increased during the year 1887. The taxable valuation\r\nof property in Duluth for the year 1886 was $11,773,720. The taxes\r\npaid in 1887 amount to $261,376.\r\n\r\nDuluth has one immense flour mill, with a capacity of 250 barrels per\r\nday. It is five stories in height, and favorably situated; having the\r\nlake upon one side and the railroads upon the other, so that loading\r\nand unloading can be carried on at once from vessels and cars.\r\n\r\nDuluth has also two large flour warehouses with a capacity of 200,000\r\nbarrels each. Large warehouses are also being built by the Northern\r\nPacific and Omaha Railroad companies. The annual shipment of flour\r\nfrom Duluth has ranged from 164,000 barrels in 1871 to 1,500,000 in\r\n1886, making an aggregate of 8,285,000 barrels in that time.\r\n\r\nThe lumber industry of Duluth is no small factor in the prosperity of\r\nthe city. The cut of the Duluth district for the past season amounts\r\nto 160,000,000 feet of lumber, 43,000,000 shingles, and 22,600,000\r\nlath, of which the city mills have manufactured one-third. Much of\r\nthis lumber has been shipped to Chicago and the East, and a new\r\ndistrict, the Tower mining region, has lately been opened for\r\nshipment.\r\n\r\nWe have alluded to the harbor of Duluth as one of the best on the\r\nlake. It consists of what is known as the Bay of Superior, a body of\r\nwater about seven miles long by one mile in width, almost entirely\r\nshut off from the lake by a narrow strip of land known as Minnesota\r\nPoint. The original entrance to this bay was through a channel on the\r\nsoutheast of the Point, separating it from Wisconsin Point, a similar\r\ntongue of land in the same line of direction. As this entrance was\r\ninconvenient and difficult, a canal was cut across the point near the\r\nmainland, sufficiently large to admit all vessels that pass through\r\nSte. Marie's canal. Since the construction of the canal through\r\nMinnesota Point, the old landing in front of the city has been\r\nabandoned, and elevators have been built on the shores of the bay.\r\nThese elevators are the best of their class, and have a total capacity\r\nof 20,000,000 bushels. They were ten in number, exclusive of several\r\nwarehouses; two, however, have been destroyed by fire. The walls of\r\nthe canal have been extended in the form of piers 1,000 feet into the\r\nlake. One of these piers is supplied with a lighthouse and a fog horn.\r\nThe canal is 700 feet long and 250 feet in width. The arrivals and\r\nclearances for the port of Duluth in 1886 were 2,180.\r\n\r\nThe fish trade is no inconsiderable part of the industries of Duluth.\r\nTwo large firms have their headquarters here and the amount of capital\r\ninvested in the business amounts to $165,000. During 1886 1,200,000\r\npounds of fish were shipped to Duluth for reshipment to other places,\r\nfrom the various fisheries of these companies. The United States fish\r\ncommissioners, realizing the value of Lake Superior as a reservoir\r\nfor food fish, have projected the largest fish hatchery on the lakes,\r\nto be located at Lester's Park. It is to be under government and state\r\ncontrol and will supply the lakes of Superior and Michigan with about\r\n500,000,000 eggs yearly.\r\n\r\nDuluth was organized and laid out as a village under the town site law\r\nof 1844; Richard Ralf, surveyor; Geo. E. Nettleton, J. B. Culver, O.\r\nW. Rice, Wm. Nettleton, and Robt. E. Jefferson, proprietors. The date\r\nof this organization is not known. We have a statement from Hon. W. G.\r\nLe Duc, of Hastings, to the effect, that in the winter of 1852-53, A.\r\nRamsey, H. M. Rice, Maj. Watrous and himself, with two others whose\r\nnames he can not recall, organized as a company and projected a town\r\nsite at the west end of the lake, on the present site of Duluth. Maj.\r\nWatrous, the Indian agent, was instructed to take necessary measures\r\nto secure the land. Watrous failed to secure the property and the\r\nscheme failed. Mr. Le Duc projected and introduced a charter in the\r\nterritorial legislature, which was passed, for a railroad to Duluth.\r\n\r\nIn 1870 the city of Duluth was first incorporated, and five years\r\nlater a portion of the same territory was incorporated as the village\r\nof Duluth, and the two municipal corporations were still in existence\r\nFeb. 25, 1887, when the act imposing certain political obligations\r\nupon the then existing city of Duluth became a law. The second day of\r\nMarch another law went into effect incorporating both the city and\r\nvillage of Duluth as the present city.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOND DU LAC,\r\n\r\nLocated at the head of navigation on St. Louis river, and at the foot\r\nof the rapids, is a point of considerable historical interest, it\r\nhaving long been in use as a trading post. It has been a place of\r\noutfit and departure for trading expeditions for two hundred years.\r\nThe old stone trading house of the Astor Fur Company still remains. It\r\nis surrounded by about twenty buildings of more recent date. It is now\r\nbetter known as a station on the Northern Pacific railroad. It was\r\nsurveyed in 1856 by Richard Ralf and platted into village lots. The\r\nplats were signed by James A. Markland, attorney for the proprietors.\r\nFond du Lac is now a village of some magnitude.\r\n\r\n\r\nONEOTA\r\n\r\nWas settled some time in the '40s, by Edmund F. Ely and others, and\r\nbecame a village of some note, containing a post office, church and\r\nother evidences of prosperity. It was platted as a village in 1856; H.\r\nW. Wheeler, surveyor; Marcus W. McCracken, Bion W. Bacon, Edmund F.\r\nEly, proprietors. The first recorded deed in St. Louis county is a\r\nquitclaim deed from B. H. Baer to E. F. Ely, of the town site of Ely;\r\nconsideration, $1,500. The deed bears date of April 20, 1856. Oneota\r\nis now included in the plat of Duluth.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLIFTON.\r\n\r\nThis village was platted in 1858, by John S. Watrous, on the shores of\r\nthe lake north of Duluth. It is now within the Duluth city limits.\r\n\r\n\r\nPORTLAND,\r\n\r\nA village on the lake shore above Duluth, was platted in 1856. The\r\nproprietors were Aaron B. Robbins, James D. Ray, C. Marshall and J. J.\r\nPost. It is now within the Duluth city limits.\r\n\r\n\r\nENDION,\r\n\r\nLocated on the north shore, was surveyed Dec. 15, 1856, by Chas.\r\nMartin; M. 7P. Niel and others, proprietors. It is now within the\r\nDuluth city limits.\r\n\r\n\r\nMIDDLETON,\r\n\r\nLocated on Minnesota Point, was surveyed Aug. 1, 1856; proprietors,\r\nRobert Reed, T. A. Markland.\r\n\r\n\r\nMONTEZUMA,\r\n\r\nLocated on the north shore, was surveyed in May, 1856, by Vose Palmer;\r\nproprietor, Frederic Ottoman.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUCHANAN,\r\n\r\nLocated on the north shore, was surveyed in October, 1856; proprietor,\r\nW. G. Cowell.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. LOUIS FALLS\r\n\r\nWas surveyed in 1857, by C. E. Clark; Thos. H. Hogan, attorney for\r\nproprietors.\r\n\r\n\r\nFREMONT ISLAND.\r\n\r\nA peculiar feature of St. Louis bay has been the formation of floating\r\nislands, possibly the result of the collection of driftwood and other\r\ndebris at the mouth of St. Louis river. The rafts thus formed in time\r\nbecame consolidated by the deposition of earthy materials, leaves,\r\ntwigs and vegetable matter, and are covered with a rank growth of\r\nvegetation, at first shrubby, but at last arboreous. The roots of the\r\nshrubs and trees interlace, and hold the material of the raft more\r\ntightly together. These island rafts are sometimes loosened and float\r\ninto the bay, and are driven about by the winds from one side of the\r\nbay to the other.\r\n\r\nOne of these islands, supposed to be stationary, known as Fremont\r\nisland, was surveyed and platted in 1856, by C. P. Heustis and Chas.\r\nA. Post. On the completion of the canal it broke loose from its\r\nmoorings, floated away and disappeared, in all probability going to\r\npieces in the rough waters of the lake.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOWER,\r\n\r\nLocated on the southern shore of Vermillion lake, was surveyed Aug. 4,\r\n1884. The proprietors are the Minnesota Iron Company, of which\r\nCharlemagne Tower is president. The iron mines located in this\r\nvicinity are amongst the richest on the continent. Attention was first\r\ncalled to the Vermillion by the reported discovery of gold. Machinery\r\nfor crushing and smelting was transported thither, but the thousands\r\nwho rushed to the reputed gold field expecting to become suddenly\r\nrich, returned disappointed and disheartened. Attention had long\r\nbefore been called to the fact that there were rich iron mines in the\r\ndistrict, but the circumstances were unfavorable for their\r\ndevelopment. They were in a remote position and accessible only by a\r\njourney of several days through woods and swamps. These mines could be\r\nreached and developed only by state aid, which was given in the shape\r\nof a grant of swamp lands, to be applied to building a railway from\r\nthe lake to the mines. This grant having been obtained, Mr. Tower and\r\nother capitalists at once invested their millions in the mines,\r\npurchasing some 8,000 acres of land, covering the larger portion of\r\nthe iron deposits in the district, embracing the present site of the\r\nvillage of Tower. A railroad sixty-eight miles in length was\r\nconstructed from Tower to Two Harbors, a point twenty-seven miles\r\nnorth of Duluth. This road was completed in the spring of 1884, and\r\nthe first shipment was made July 3d of that year, the total shipments\r\nfor the year being 62,124 tons. The shipments for 1885 were 225,484\r\ntons, and for 1886, 304,000 tons. Over $3,000,000 was paid to laborers\r\nin the Tower mines in 1887.\r\n\r\nCOL. GEORGE E. STONE, of Duluth, is deserving of praise for his\r\nforesight and energy in opening the Tower mines. Mr. Stone labored\r\nwith untiring zeal after the land grant to aid in building the road\r\nwas given until the road was built and the mines opened.\r\n\r\nGEORGE R. STUNTZ is well known as the government surveyor of the Lake\r\nSuperior region, whose work covers thousands of miles of North\r\nWisconsin lands, lying along the southern shore of the lake, and who\r\nhas accurately mapped the meanderings of the influent streams, the\r\nbays and shaggy projecting shores of the great \"Unsalted Sea.\" There\r\nis no better topographical authority than Mr. Stuntz, and no one\r\nbetter posted as to the location and value of the Northern Wisconsin\r\nareas and the Vermillion mines.\r\n\r\nHaving early made Superior City and Duluth his home, and for nearly\r\nforty years having been identified with the interests of the West\r\nSuperior country, he is an oft-quoted authority. Many of his published\r\narticles contain most valuable information concerning the feasibility\r\nof connecting St. Croix and Superior waters. His assertions concerning\r\nthe mineral wealth of the lake country, made before the development of\r\nthe mines, have since been verified. Mr. Stuntz is a typical, sensible\r\nfrontiersman, of American birth, aged about seventy years.\r\n\r\nCHARLES HINMAN GRAVES, a native of Springfield, Massachusetts, born in\r\n1839, received a liberal education, and in 1861 enlisted as a private\r\nin the Fortieth Massachusetts Volunteers, but was promoted step by\r\nstep to the rank of lieutenant colonel. He was severely wounded at the\r\nbattle of Gettysburg. In 1865 he was commissioned as a colonel in the\r\nregular army, but resigned in 1870, and located at Duluth. From 1873\r\nto 1876 he was a member of the state senate. He has held several\r\npublic positions in Duluth, and stands deservedly high as a citizen.\r\nHe has labored zealously and efficiently for the prosperity of Duluth.\r\n\r\nOZRO P. STEARNS was born Jan. 13, 1831, at De Kalb, Lawrence county,\r\nNew York. In his youth he was dependent upon his own resources. He\r\ngraduated at Michigan University in 1858, after which he visited\r\nCalifornia, tried mining for a short time, and returning graduated in\r\nthe law department of Michigan University. In 1860 he came to\r\nRochester, Minnesota, and opened a law office. In 1862 he enlisted in\r\nCompany F, Ninth Minnesota Volunteers, of which he was commissioned\r\nfirst lieutenant, but in 1864 was promoted to the colonelcy of the\r\nThirty-ninth United States Infantry (colored). He served through many\r\nbattles and campaigns, and was mustered out at the close of the war.\r\nIn January, 1866, he returned to Rochester; in 1867 was appointed\r\nregister in bankruptcy for Southern Minnesota; in January, 1871, he\r\nwas elected to the United States senate for a short term to fill the\r\nvacancy caused by the death of D. S. Norton. In 1872 he removed to\r\nDuluth, and in 1874 was appointed judge of the Eleventh Judicial\r\ndistrict, to which office he was elected in the fall of the same year,\r\nwhich position, by re-election, he still holds. Judge Stearns was\r\nmarried in February, 1863, to Sarah Burger, of Detroit, Michigan.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAKE COUNTY.\r\n\r\nThis county lies on the north shore of Lake Superior, between the\r\ncounties of Cook and St. Louis, extending northward to the British\r\nline. The whole region is abrupt, broken into hills and valleys, and\r\nrich in silver, iron and other metals.\r\n\r\nThe great Vermillion iron mines of St. Louis county find an outlet\r\nthrough this county by the Duluth & Iron Range railroad, which finds a\r\nlake station at Two Harbors. The road was built from Two Harbors to\r\nVermillion lake in 1885, from Two Harbors to Duluth in 1887. The\r\nentire road and extensive mines were sold in June, 1887, for\r\n$8,000,000, to Porter and others, who are now extending the road from\r\nVermillion lake eastward to Thunder Bay and Port Arthur. It is already\r\ncompleted to Ely, a distance of twenty miles.\r\n\r\nEmigration during the years 1886-7 to this county has been very\r\nextensive. The two counties, Lake and Cook, have many features in\r\ncommon. They are similar in geological formation, produce the same\r\nmetals in the same generous abundance, and being in the same latitude,\r\nand bordering upon the same lake, differ in no wise in climate and but\r\nlittle in productions. Large quantities of pine timber may be found in\r\nthese counties, and saw mills are located along the lake shore where\r\nan accessible harbor can be found. There are several harbors between\r\nDuluth and Thunder Bay that might be improved by the government,\r\ngreatly to the advantage of the country.\r\n\r\nThe silver mines of Isle Royal and along the national boundary are\r\nextensive, and yield rich returns to the companies working them.\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO HARBORS,\r\n\r\nA flourishing village located on the shore of Lake Superior, takes its\r\nname from two small harbors bearing that name. The Vermillion Iron\r\nCompany have built extensive piers into the lake to facilitate the\r\nshipping of ores. They have large shops for railroad purposes, with an\r\nelectric light plant. The company employ about two hundred men. Two\r\nHarbors is the county seat of Lake county.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOOK COUNTY.\r\n\r\nGrand Marais is the county seat of Cook county. It is a round,\r\nland-locked harbor. It has a lighthouse, and the government has built\r\na breakwater four hundred feet long, thus making it a harbor of\r\nrefuge, so that boats can lie with safety in any storm. Grand Marais\r\nis one hundred and ten miles from Duluth, on the north shore of Lake\r\nSuperior. It is the best harbor that Minnesota has except Duluth. It\r\nis thirty miles south of the international boundary line, and\r\nforty-five miles northeast of the line by Lake Superior. It is the\r\nnatural outlet for the mineral deposits north. There are large\r\nquantities of iron ore within thirty-five miles of the harbor. A\r\nrailroad line has been run, and men are now at work on the iron\r\ndeposits with a view of shipping the ore from Grand Marais to points\r\nwhere it is wanted for smelting purposes.\r\n\r\nGrand Marais was in early days one of the Northwest Fur Company's\r\ntrading posts, but of late years has been used as a fishing station.\r\nStreets in the town are now being laid out, and from present\r\nindications Cook county, with its pine lands, iron ore and other\r\nmineral resources, will be one of the most thriving counties in the\r\nState, with Grand Marais as not only a harbor of refuge, but one of\r\nthe competing ports for the shipment of iron ore.\r\n\r\nH. Mayhew, to whom we are indebted for items of interest concerning\r\nCook county, is the oldest resident of Grand Marais, and one of the\r\ntown proprietors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nHENNEPIN COUNTY.\r\n\r\nHennepin county was organized March 6, 1852. Prior to the organization\r\nof Minnesota Territory it was in Clayton county, Iowa. At the\r\norganization of the Territory, in 1849, it was included in Dakota\r\ncounty, and so remained until set off in 1852. Hon. Bradley B. Meeker\r\nheld the first court within the present limits of the county, at the\r\nold government mill, in 1849. Taylor Dudley was clerk of court,\r\nFranklin Steele, foreman of grand jury. The first board of\r\ncommissioners were Alex. Moore, chairman, John Jackins and Joseph\r\nDean. The first election was held Oct. 21, 1852, at the house of Col.\r\nJohn H. Stevens, on the west side. The county is a rich agricultural\r\nregion, abounding with beautiful lakes, of which Minnetonka is the\r\nlargest and finest. The county is bounded on the north by the\r\nMississippi river and Wright county, on the east by the Mississippi\r\nriver and Ramsey county, on the south by the Minnesota river and\r\nCarver county, on the west by Wright and Carver counties. It is\r\nsubdivided into the following towns: Bloomington, Brooklyn, Champlin,\r\nCrystal Lake, Corcoran, Dayton, Eden Prairie, Excelsior, Greenwood,\r\nHasson, Independence, Maple Grove, Medina, Minneapolis, Minnetonka,\r\nMinnetrista, Osseo, Plymouth, Richfield, and St. Anthony.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FORT SNELLING, ON LINE OF C., M. & ST. P. RY.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFORT SNELLING.\r\n\r\nFort Snelling owes its origin to the encroachments of British traders\r\non our northern frontier. As early as 1805 Lieut. Zebulen Montgomery\r\nPike, United States Army, was sent with a detachment of troops to\r\nexplore the Upper Mississippi river to expel British traders who might\r\nbe found encroaching upon our territory, and to secure by treaty a\r\nmilitary reservation. Sept. 21, 1805, he encamped on Pike island, at\r\nthe junction of the Minnesota and Mississippi rivers, and, being\r\npleased with the situation, forthwith made a treaty with chiefs of the\r\nSioux nation to include all that tract of land lying from below the\r\nconfluence of the two rivers, up the Mississippi, including the falls\r\nof St. Anthony, nine miles in width on each side of the river. The\r\nprice paid was $2,000. The reserve thus purchased was not used for\r\nmilitary purposes until 1819, when a detachment of the Fifth United\r\nStates Infantry, commanded by Lieut. Col. Henry Leavenworth, was sent\r\nto occupy the reservation and build a fort. The building of the fort,\r\nwith its various stone and wooden buildings, was the work of years.\r\nThe site of the fort was selected in 1820, by Col. Josiah Snelling,\r\nwho named it Fort St. Anthony, but at the suggestion of Gen. Winfield\r\nScott, in 1824 the name was changed to Fort Snelling as a worthy\r\ncompliment to its founder and builder. Notwithstanding the treaty made\r\nby Col. Pike in 1805, the Indian claim to the reservation was not\r\nextinguished until the treaty of 1837, ratified by the senate in 1838.\r\nIn 1836, before the extinction of the Indian title, many settlers\r\nlocated on the reservation on the left bank of the Mississippi. These\r\nwere forcibly removed by the United States government in 1840, under\r\nthe act of March 3, 1807, an act to prevent settlements being made on\r\nceded lands until duly authorized by law. The reservation was reduced\r\nfrom time to time, portions being sold. In 1857 Franklin Steele\r\npurchased the entire reservation, with the exception of two small\r\ntracts, including the fort itself, for the sum of $90,000, to be paid\r\nin three yearly installments. The first payments were actually made,\r\nthe troops were withdrawn, and Mr. Steele assumed possession. Default\r\nhaving been made in the two remaining payments, the government resumed\r\npossession of a small portion of the reservation and fort in 1861. The\r\nyear following, by act of Congress, the reservation was reduced. In\r\n1870 it was permanently reduced to 1,531.20 acres. A suit at law\r\nbetween Mr. Steele and the United States government was compromised by\r\nreleasing him from further payments and granting him a large tract of\r\nland lying along the right bank of the Mississippi, north of the fort,\r\nwith a portion of Pike's island.\r\n\r\nMaj. Plympton and other officers of the fort, in company with Franklin\r\nSteele, made the first land claim, by permit of the government, at\r\nEast St. Anthony, in 1838. They built a shanty and hired a Frenchman\r\nto occupy it. Steele bought out the interests of the officers\r\nassociated with him and in 1848 secured a title from the United\r\nStates. The first saw mill built on this claim was commenced by Mr.\r\nSteele, in conjunction with Boston parties in 1847, but was not\r\ncompleted until the following year.\r\n\r\nThe next land claim on the river was made further up, by R. P. Russell\r\nand S. J. Findley. This was sold to Bottineau and afterward passed to\r\nother parties. The land claim adjoining Steele's, below, was\r\npurchased of a Frenchman by C. A. Tuttle in 1848. This claim is now\r\npartially occupied by the State University. W. Henry Cheever made a\r\nclaim south of Tuttle's, on which, in 1849, he built a hotel and a\r\nhuge wooden tower or observatory, nearly one hundred feet in height,\r\nover the entrance to which was a rhyming couplet:\r\n\r\n    \"Pay your dime\r\n    And climb.\"\r\n\r\nFranklin Steele, before completing his mill and dam, became sole owner\r\nof the water power on the east side of the river. During the periods\r\nfollowing the property has often changed owners, and sometimes the\r\nchange has resulted in unprofitable litigation. James J. Hill, in\r\nlater years, has become the owner of most of the water power of\r\nNicollet and Hennepin islands and of the east shore, and is making\r\nvaluable improvements.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. ANTHONY FALLS.\r\n\r\nSt. Anthony Falls was platted as a village in 1849, and was included\r\nin Ramsey county until 1856. In 1861 the legislature established\r\nsatisfactory boundaries, annexing part of town 29, range 24, to\r\nHennepin county.\r\n\r\nAmong the first settlers of the Falls was Ard Godfrey. The first white\r\nchild born here was a son of C. A. Tuttle, millwright. The Luther\r\nPatch family, consisting of four sons and two daughters, was the first\r\nresident American family at the Falls. Mr. Patch's sons were Edward,\r\nWallace, Gibson, and Lewis; the daughters, Marion, who became the wife\r\nof R. P. Russell, the first marriage at the Falls, Oct. 3, 1848, and\r\nCora, who became the wife of Joseph Marshall. An earlier marriage was\r\ncelebrated at Fort Snelling May 27, 1835, that of Lieut. Edmund A.\r\nOgden and Eliza Edna Loomis; Rev. Thos. S. Williamson officiating.\r\nThis was the first marriage north of Prairie du Chien. The first store\r\nwas opened by R. P. Russell in 1847, the second, in 1849, by Joseph\r\nMarshall. We find Jacob Fisher, of Stillwater, here in 1847, building\r\nthe dam from Nicollet island to the east shore. Among the operators of\r\nthe mill who have been prominent citizens of St. Anthony Falls are\r\nSumner W. Farnham, John Rollins, Caleb W. Dorr, John McDonald, and\r\nRobert W. Cummings. Some of these men brought their families here. The\r\nbuilding of the mill was somewhat delayed by the sinking in the Erie\r\ncanal of the boats containing the machinery, hardware, etc. Standing\r\npine to be used in the mill was purchased of Hole-in-the-Day, a\r\nChippewa chief, cut and floated down from Sauk Rapids to the Falls.\r\nSome timber was also brought from Rum river, the first cut on that\r\nstream, except for government use. At the land sale in 1848, Mr.\r\nSteele secured all the land above Tuttle's to the north limits of the\r\ncity. Amongst the settlers in 1848 were the Getchells, Smiths, Rogers'\r\nand Huse. In 1849, at the organization of the territory of Minnesota,\r\na number of others arrived, among them Judge B. B. Meeker, Dr. John H.\r\nMurphy, John W. North, J. P. Wilson, and John G. Lennon. During this\r\nyear the west half of sec. 14, range 29, was surveyed and platted into\r\ntown lots by W. R. Marshall, B. W. Bronson and S. P. Folsom. Anson\r\nNorthrup commenced the erection of the first hotel, the St. Charles.\r\n\r\nJohn Rollins was elected to the territorial council, W. R. Marshall\r\nand Wm. Dugas to the house of representatives. The district was\r\ncomprised of St. Anthony Falls and Little Canada.\r\n\r\nThe first school was taught by Miss Electa Bachus, in the summer of\r\n1849. A post office was established and Ard Godfrey was appointed\r\npostmaster. There were occasional mails brought in John Rollins'\r\npassenger wagon. In 1850 Willoughby & Powers ran a daily stage line\r\nfrom St. Paul and the mail thenceforth was carried regularly. John W.\r\nNorth built a dwelling on Nicollet island, which became a social\r\ncentre, and was made attractive by a piano. In 1850 a public library\r\nwas established, the first in Minnesota. Rev. E. D. Neill, the\r\nhistorian of Minnesota, delivered the first public lecture and\r\npreached the first sermon in 1849. The following year, the Baptists,\r\nMethodists, Congregationalists and Presbyterians organized societies,\r\nand in 1851 the Episcopalians and Universalists. Amongst the\r\naccessions to the population were Judge Isaac Atwater, W. W. Wales, J.\r\nB. Bassett, C. W. Christmas, and Joseph Dean. Col. Alvaren Allen\r\nopened a livery stable. The St. Anthony _Express_, the first\r\nnewspaper, was established May 31, 1851; E. Tyler, proprietor, Judge\r\nI. Atwater, editor. Measures were taken to locate the university in\r\nSt. Anthony Falls. Citizens contributed $3,000 aid to in the erection\r\nof the building.\r\n\r\nFacilities of communication with the surrounding country were none of\r\nthe best, yet communication was early established with the Red River\r\ncountry, a dog train having arrived from Pembina, distant four hundred\r\nmiles, in sixteen days. On this train Kittson, Rolette and Gingras\r\ncame down to attend the territorial legislature at St. Paul as\r\nrepresentatives of Pembina county.\r\n\r\nFranklin Steele, in 1847, established a ferry above the Falls. In 1854\r\nthe Minnesota Bridge Company was organized, consisting of Franklin\r\nSteele, H. T. Wells, R. P. Russell, and others. A handsome suspension\r\nbridge was finished in 1855. This bridge remained in the control of\r\nthe company fifteen years, when by an act of the legislature the value\r\nwas assessed and Hennepin county purchased the bridge, and it became a\r\nfree thoroughfare.\r\n\r\nApril 13, 1855, St. Anthony Falls was incorporated as a city with the\r\nfollowing officers: Mayor, H. T. Welles; clerk, W. F. Brawley;\r\naldermen, B. F. Spencer, John Orth, Daniel Stanchfield, Edward\r\nLippincott, Caleb W. Dorr, and Robert Cummings.\r\n\r\nIn 1872 St. Anthony Falls was annexed to Minneapolis, and placed under\r\nthe same government, a movement which has resulted in great benefit to\r\nboth cities.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. ANTHONY FALLS.\r\n\r\nThe earliest written descriptions of St. Anthony falls were by the\r\nRoman Catholic missionaries, Hennepin and LaSalle. The former with\r\nAccault and Du Gay ascended the river in a canoe until captured by a\r\nband of Sioux Indians. These Indians left the river at a point now the\r\npresent site of St. Paul and took their prisoners to Mille Lacs. In\r\nSeptember, when the Indians set out on their annual hunt, the captives\r\nwere left to go where they pleased. Accault preferred remaining with\r\nthe Indians. Hennepin and Du Gay obtained a small canoe and commenced\r\nthe descent of the Rum and Mississippi rivers to the falls, then\r\ncalled by the Indians Ka-ka-bi-ka Irara or \"Severed Rock.\" They\r\nreached the falls about the first of October, and named them after St.\r\nAnthony of Padua. The description given by La Salle, a second hand\r\none, was probably derived from Hennepin, Accault or Du Gay, as La\r\nSalle did not visit the falls, and these voyageurs were his\r\nsubordinates, and had been sent by him to explore the Upper\r\nMississippi.\r\n\r\nHe says: \"In going up the Mississippi again, twenty leagues above the\r\nSt. Croix is found the falls, which those I sent named St. Anthony.\r\nThey are thirty or forty feet high, and the river is narrower here\r\nthan elsewhere. There is a small island in the midst of the chute, and\r\nthe two banks of the river are bordered by hills which gradually\r\ndiminish at this point, but the country on each side is covered by\r\nthin woods, such as oaks and other hardwoods, scattered wide apart.\"\r\n\r\nThis description corresponds very well with the earliest pictures of\r\nthe falls, which with \"the small island in the midst of the chute\"\r\nmake them resemble slightly a Niagara considerably diminished in\r\nheight. The historic falls have almost entirely disappeared or so\r\nchanged as to become unrecognizable. Spirit island, if this be the\r\nisland referred to by La Salle as in the midst of the chute, is now so\r\nfar below the falls that it can scarcely be brought into the same\r\npicture with them. The falls have undoubtedly receded, by a process\r\neasily explained by a geologist, some distance up the river, and have\r\ndiminished somewhat in altitude. The movement of the falls up stream,\r\ncaused by the breaking off of limestone ledges, overlying sandstone,\r\neasily washed from beneath by the falling water, threatened the total\r\nobliteration of the cataract unless arrested by artificial means, as\r\nthe dip or inclination of the rock is such that the altitude of the\r\nfalls diminishes with the wearing away of these ledges: It has been\r\nfound necessary to strengthen the ledges and prevent further erosion\r\nby means of aprons, till the present appearance of the falls is not\r\nunsuggestive of a series of dams. The entire cost of these\r\nimprovements has amounted to more than $1,000,000. The shores of the\r\nislands and mainlands have been covered with mills and manufactories,\r\nwhile the scene is still further disfigured by a maze of railway and\r\nother bridges, waterways and flumes. Scarce a vestige of the original\r\nfalls remain to recall their appearance as they were when the sandaled\r\nand robed Franciscan, Hennepin, first gazed upon them. In the midst of\r\nthis solitude, and on the banks once covered by a sparse growth of\r\ntrees, one of the finest cities in the West has sprung up as if by\r\nmagic, and the scene is one of busy life. This marvelous change has\r\noccurred within a space of fifty years.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINNEAPOLIS.\r\n\r\nFrom the establishment and occupation of Fort Snelling in 1819, to the\r\nsettlement of the county in 1840, numerous traders and adventurers,\r\ngenerally of French or Canadian origin, and not infrequently\r\nintermarried with Indians, and semi-Indian in their habits of life,\r\noccupied transient homes on or near the military reservation; but\r\nthese have exercised so little influence upon the development of the\r\ncountry that they merit no recognition or record from the historian.\r\nAs a general thing, they disappeared before the march of civilization.\r\nA few, wiser, stronger, more far-seeing than the rest, adapted\r\nthemselves to the new order, made claims, engaged in the enterprises\r\nof civilized life, and thus obtained an honorable position amongst the\r\npioneers of the country.\r\n\r\nOf these, Joseph R. Brown, by far the most distinguished, by\r\npermission of the military authorities, located in Hennepin county\r\nnear the falls of Minnehaha, in 1829. He is the first white settler.\r\nMaj. Taliaferro, then in command of the Fort, in the same year made a\r\nfarm on the shores of Lake Calhoun, and placed Philander Prescott in\r\ncharge. In 1834 the Pond brothers, missionaries, located on Lake\r\nCalhoun and erected the first dwelling worthy of the name within the\r\npresent limits of the county of Hennepin. In 1849 Philander Prescott\r\nmade a claim on what is now Minnehaha avenue. Frank Steele obtained\r\npermission from the secretary of war to occupy this claim, whereupon\r\nMr. Prescott abandoned it, and made another on laud adjoining. This he\r\nwas allowed to retain. Charles Mosseaux, by permission of the military\r\nauthorities, made a claim on Lake Calhoun in 1856. This claim is now\r\noccupied by the pavillion. Rev. E. G. Gear, chaplain at Fort Snelling,\r\nby permission of the military authorities, made a claim near Lake\r\nCalhoun and employed Edward Brissett to live upon it. Afterward a\r\ncontest arose as to the ownership. Chaplain Gear, by the aid of Judge\r\nBlack and H. M. Rice, secured a congressional enactment allowing him\r\nto purchase the land from the government. David Gohram made a claim on\r\nthe Lake of the Isles, but subsequently sold out to R. P. Russell.\r\nJohn Berry, the Blaisdells, Pierce Lowell and many others located in\r\nthe vicinity of Lakes Calhoun and Harriet, and in 1853 were followed\r\nby settlers on nearly all the lands lying immediately west of the\r\nMississippi, in the vicinity of the falls. In 1854 there were twelve\r\nfarm houses scattered widely from the falls to the vicinity of the\r\nlakes. It had been evident for some time that a city of considerable\r\npretensions must arise somewhere in the vicinity of the Fort and the\r\nfalls. The locality of the coming city was decided largely by\r\nadvantages of situation, and these were in favor of the locality\r\nimmediately adjoining the falls, the water power there afforded being\r\na powerful attraction. For the first recognition of these advantages\r\nwe must go back to a period several years anterior to the location of\r\nthese claims and there find a starting point in the history of\r\nMinneapolis.\r\n\r\nIn 1820 the military authorities at Fort Snelling had erected a stone\r\nmill for sawing their own lumber and grinding the grain shipped from\r\nSt. Louis. They also built a log house and cultivated a few acres of\r\nadjacent ground. This mill, run by the water of the falls, was located\r\na short distance below. This was the first utilization of the water\r\npower. The mill, which has long since disappeared, was located on the\r\npresent site of Sidle, Fletcher & Holmes' flouring mill. In 1854 one\r\nsaw mill, the first in Minneapolis aside from the old government mill,\r\nwas located just below the falls. It had a capacity of 1,500,000 feet\r\nper annum and besides manufactured great quantities of shingles. It\r\nwas under the direction of C. King. A steam saw mill was built at the\r\nmouth of Bassett's creek, above the falls, in 1856, and another the\r\nfollowing year, half a mile further up the river. Thus began the great\r\nlumber business of Minneapolis, in 1857 there being three mills with\r\nan aggregate capacity of 75,000,000 feet per annum.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the government with regard to the lands reserved about\r\nthe Fort, the act of 1839, driving off those who had settled upon them\r\nand destroying their property, and the uncertainty with regard to the\r\ntenure of land claims, acted as an effectual bar to further\r\nimprovement until ten years later, when Hon. Robert Smith, member of\r\nCongress from Alton district, Illinois, and Col. John H. Stevens, the\r\npioneer of Minneapolis, each obtained permits from the secretary of\r\nwar and the officers of the Fort to occupy one hundred and sixty acres\r\nof the reservation. Smith's location included the stone mill, which he\r\nagreed to use in grinding Fort Snelling grain. Mr. Smith engaged C. A.\r\nTuttle to operate the mill and hold the claim. Mr. Tuttle was to have\r\nan interest for his labor. This interest he afterward sold to Smith,\r\nwho, when the government relinquished the reservation, transferred his\r\nclaim to Anson Northrup and others, who were organized into an\r\nassociation for the entry of land. Soon as the entries were completed\r\nthe land passed into the hands of the Minneapolis Water Power Company,\r\nwhich proceeded at once to improve the water power.\r\n\r\nCol. J. H. Stevens meanwhile located in person on his permit, and in\r\n1849 built the first frame house in Minneapolis, on the ground now\r\noccupied by the union depot. J. B. Bassett purchased the fraction of\r\nland on the river above Stevens, Col. Emanuel Case the fraction above\r\nBassett's, A. E. Ames the eighty where the court house stands, and\r\nEdwin Hedderly the fraction below the water power. Mr. Stevens made\r\nthe first survey of village lots in the spring of 1854; Chas. W.\r\nChristmas, surveyor.\r\n\r\nThe Smith claim was surveyed by W. R. Marshall in the fall of 1854. In\r\n1856 Atwater's addition was surveyed. Other additions were added from\r\nyear to year as the growth of the city demanded. At the release of the\r\nreservation in 1855, the entire present site of the city was covered\r\nwith claims.\r\n\r\nThe name Minneapolis, derived from an Indian word _minne_, meaning\r\n_water_, and a Greek word _polis_, meaning _city_, had been early\r\napplied to the new village, Chas. Hoag having first suggested the\r\nname. In March, 1853, the commissioners of Hennepin county adopted the\r\nname as that of a territorial precinct. A government land office had\r\nbeen established in 1854, of which M. L. Olds was register and R. P.\r\nRussell receiver. The first, newspaper, the Minneapolis _Democrat_,\r\nwas established in 1854. During the same year the Masons and Odd\r\nFellows organized lodges, the Presbyterians, Baptists and Methodists\r\norganized societies, and public schools were established. In 1857 the\r\ncourt house, at a cost of $12,000, a school house, and several\r\nchurches were erected.\r\n\r\nThe village of Minneapolis was organized in 1858. H. T. Welles was the\r\nfirst president. In 1867 Minneapolis obtained a city charter.\r\nMinneapolis and St. Anthony Falls were united under the same\r\ngovernment, by act of legislature, approved Feb. 28, 1872, under the\r\nname of Minneapolis, St. Anthony Falls being recognized in the\r\ndirectory as East Minneapolis. The united cities elect in common a\r\nmayor and city council, but each is financially responsible as to\r\ncontracts existing previous to the union, and each maintains its own\r\nschools.\r\n\r\nWe append a list of mayors of the two cities prior and subsequent to\r\nthe union:\r\n\r\n    MAYORS OF ST.

The question is partly an economical one, as\r\nowing to the heavy expenses entailed upon mill owners to prevent the\r\nretrogression of the falls, it may be cheaper for saw mill owners to\r\nuse steam, especially as they can feed their furnaces with but little\r\nexpense from the slabs and debris of their own lumber; but in this\r\ncase a weightier reason may be found in the fact that the west side\r\nof the river has been occupied chiefly by flouring mills, and the saw\r\nmills are moved to less eligible localities, and find it more\r\nconvenient and economical to use steam instead of water.\r\n\r\n\r\nTERRIFIC EXPLOSION AT THE FLOUR MILLS.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable mill disasters of modern times occurred May\r\n2, 1878, in the Washington A mill. About 7 P. M. the sound of a\r\nterrific explosion was heard and the city was shaken as by an\r\nearthquake. The mill in which it occurred was utterly demolished, as\r\nwere also the Humboldt, the Zenith and the Palisade, while several\r\nothers were badly wrecked. There were fourteen lives lost and the\r\nproperty destroyed amounted in value to over $1,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe cause of the explosion was at first not understood, but on\r\nthorough investigation was finally attributed to a mixture of\r\nexceedingly fine grain and flour dust with the air of the mills, in\r\nsuch proportion as to form a combustible mixture, which was\r\naccidentally ignited. The mills destroyed have since been replaced by\r\nbetter ones. The great Pilsbury A mill, which is perhaps beyond\r\nquestion the largest in the world, was begun in the following year. A\r\ncanal was cut to supply it with power, and it was equipped with two\r\nVictor turbine water wheels of 1,450 horse power each and a 1,400\r\nhorse power engine; it was furnished with 400 pairs of rollers, 200\r\nmiddlings purifiers, 20 run of stone, 200 bolting reels and other\r\ndevices in keeping.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBURBAN RESORTS--LAKE MINNETONKA.\r\n\r\nThis magnificent lake is 10 miles southwest of Minneapolis, and 20\r\nmiles from St. Paul. Its extreme length is about 18 miles, varying in\r\nwidth from 1 to 5 miles. Its water area is about 15,000 acres, and its\r\nshore line is estimated at nearly 300 miles. A glance at the map will\r\nshow what a variety of scenery it must have, being so broken and\r\nirregular. Its banks and islands are covered with forest trees except\r\nat a few points where villages have been located, or where some farmer\r\nhad, years ago, cleared himself a farm.\r\n\r\nThere are three villages on Minnetonka, viz.: Excelsior, Wayzata and\r\nMound City. Excelsior was settled in 1852, by a colony from New York\r\nState, and named from the title adopted by the organization before\r\nleaving home. It was incorporated about 1879. It is located on a range\r\nof hills on the south shore of Lake Minnetonka, of which it has a\r\ncommanding view. Its present population is about 850. It has two\r\nrailways, the Minneapolis & St. Louis and the St. Paul, Minneapolis &\r\nManitoba, and a motor line. It is distant 18 miles from Minneapolis.\r\nThe oldest settlement on the lake is Wayzata, on the north shore of\r\nLake Minnetonka, 10 miles from Minneapolis, via the St. Paul,\r\nMinneapolis & Manitoba railway, which passes through the village. The\r\nname Wayzata is a corruption of the Indian word Wy-ze-a-ta, meaning\r\nNorth Shore, or North Side. The village contains about 400\r\ninhabitants, and commands considerable trade from the surrounding\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThere are several fine hotels upon the lake, equal if not superior to\r\nthe famous hotels of eastern watering places. Prominent among these\r\nare the Hotel Lafayette, built at a cost of $200,000, the Lake Park\r\nHotel and Excelsior House. Railways reach the lake at several points,\r\nand steamers make regular trips for tourists.\r\n\r\nMinnehaha Falls, rendered famous in Longfellow's poems of Hiawatha, is\r\nlocated on Minnehaha creek, midway between Fort Snelling and St.\r\nAnthony Falls. It is deservedly a favored resort.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC BUILDINGS IN MINNEAPOLIS COSTING $100,000 AND UPWARD.\r\n\r\n    Court house (not completed)                 $2,000,000\r\n    Post office                                    500,000\r\n    Exposition Hall                                350,000\r\n    Science Hall                                   125,000\r\n    Library building                               190,000\r\n    Soldiers' Home, near Minnehaha Falls           100,000\r\n    State University                               150,000\r\n    Chamber of Commerce                            285,000\r\n    Temple Court                                   250,000\r\n    Masonic Temple                                 200,000\r\n    City Market House                              225,000\r\n    Athenæum                                       250,000\r\n    Hennepin Avenue Theatre                        140,000\r\n    Washburn Orphan Asylum                         125,000\r\n    House of Good Shepherd                         200,000\r\n    Loan and Trust Company                         125,000\r\n    Guaranty Life and Trust                        300,000\r\n    Lumber Exchange                                150,000\r\n    Builders' Exchange                             100,000\r\n    Knights of Labor Exchange                      100,000\r\n    S.

He received an academic education, and remained with his parents\r\nuntil of age. He learned the trade of millwright with his father. In\r\n1832 he went to Bangor, Maine, and worked at his trade until 1835,\r\nwhen he removed to Alton, Illinois. He came to St. Croix in 1838, and\r\nsuperintended the building of a mill. In 1841 he returned to Alton,\r\nwhere he was married to Charlotte Winkler. He lived in Davenport,\r\nIowa, four years and one year at Chippewa Falls. In 1846 he removed to\r\nSt. Anthony Falls, where he helped build the first saw mill. Here he\r\nworked eight years almost continuously at his trade. He purchased two\r\nhundred acres of land here, including university lands, which he sold\r\nfor $3,500. He removed to West St. Anthony in 1852, to Robert Smith's\r\ngovernment permit, and then ran the old government flouring mill,\r\ngrinding only for the government. The grain, about 5,000 bushels\r\nannually, was brought from St. Louis. For holding Smith's permit, and\r\ngrinding, he received one-eighth of the property. The government\r\ngrinding was done for the privilege of making a claim on the\r\ngovernment reservation. This claim, eighty acres in extent, located in\r\nwhat was then called West St. Anthony, now in the heart of\r\nMinneapolis, is worth millions of dollars. Mr. Tuttle sold his\r\ninterest for $5,000. The old mill was built of stone, 30 x 30 feet,\r\nground dimensions, two stories in height, with one run of stone. The\r\nmill was built in 1822. There was a farm near the mill, cultivated by\r\nsoldiers. Mr. Tuttle returned to East St. Anthony in 1857, and removed\r\nto Minnetonka in 1858, where he lived five years. Thence he removed to\r\nTwin Rivers, Morrison county. He has a saw mill, farm and good home at\r\nTwin Rivers. In 1887 he returned to Minneapolis to spend the remainder\r\nof his days.\r\n\r\nCYRUS ALDRICH.--The subject of this memoir was born June 18, 1808, in\r\nSmithfield, Rhode Island. His father was Dexter Aldrich, and was\r\nengaged in shipping and merchandising. His mother's maiden name was\r\nHannah White. She was a descendant of Peregrine White, the first male\r\nchild born after the landing of the Pilgrim Fathers. He received such\r\nan education as could be obtained at the common schools until he was\r\neighteen years of age, when he left home to engage for a few years in\r\na seafaring life. This life not proving to his taste, he abandoned it\r\nand engaged in other pursuits. At the age of twenty-nine he emigrated\r\nto Illinois and located at Alton, where he took a contract on the\r\nMichigan and Erie canal. In 1841, or about four years later, he\r\nremoved to Galena, Illinois, where he secured employment with the firm\r\nof Galbraith & Porter, and engaged in staging and mail contracts. In\r\n1845 he was elected to the Illinois legislature. The same year he was\r\nmarried to Clara Heaton, of Indiana, who, with one son and one\r\ndaughter, survives him. In 1847 he was elected register of deeds of\r\nJoe Daviess county; in 1849 was appointed receiver of the land office\r\nat Dixon, Illinois; and in 1852 ran for Congress on the Whig ticket\r\nagainst Long John Wentworth, but was defeated by a small majority. He\r\nremoved to Minnesota in 1855, locating at Minneapolis, then but a\r\nsmall village. In 1857 he was elected a member of the Republican wing\r\nof the constitutional convention, where his ability for leadership\r\nsoon brought him to the front. In 1858 he was nominated and elected\r\nrepresentative to Congress, Minnesota having meanwhile become a state.\r\nIn 1860 he was re-elected. This was a trying time, but Mr. Aldrich\r\nacquitted himself well, and was especially commended for his devotion\r\nto the interests of the soldiers. In 1862 he declined a re-election,\r\nbut allowed his name to be used (though unsuccessfully) as a candidate\r\nfor the senate. He did not, however, entirely withdraw from public\r\naffairs, but accepted an appointment from President Lincoln as a\r\nmember of the indemnity committee to adjust claims of settlers who had\r\nsuffered during the Indian outbreak of 1862. He also devoted much of\r\nhis time and energy to the establishment of the Northern Pacific\r\nrailway.\r\n\r\nIn 1865 he was elected to the Minnesota legislature. In 1867 he was\r\nappointed postmaster of Minneapolis, which position he held for four\r\nyears. His long and busy life has been spent chiefly in public\r\nservice. He had not quite reached the scriptural limit of human life,\r\nbut it was evident that his iron constitution had been overtasked and\r\nthat he needed rest. The retirement and rest came too late. His\r\nhealth gradually failed until Oct. 5, 1871, when he closed his eyes\r\nupon the scenes of earth. His funeral, conducted from the Universalist\r\nchurch, of which he was a member, was one of the largest ever held in\r\nthe State. Citizens of all parties and classes, the masonic and other\r\nsocial and civil bodies combined in paying the last tribute of respect\r\nto one who for fifteen years had been the most active, best known and\r\nmost respected of their number.\r\n\r\nALFRED ELISHA AMES, M.D., was born at Colchester, Vermont, Dec. 13,\r\n1814. He was the oldest son of Billy and Phebe (Baker) Ames, whose\r\nancestors were early colonists from England. Alfred E. commenced the\r\nstudy of medicine in 1832. He occasionally taught school and worked at\r\nhis trade of brickmason. He also varied his labors by publishing an\r\narithmetic. He came West in 1838, locating first at Springfield,\r\nIllinois; concluded his medical studies at Rush Medical College,\r\nChicago, in 1845. Before leaving Illinois he was elected to the state\r\nsenate. In 1851 he came to St. Anthony Falls, made a claim, and\r\nentered into partnership with Dr. J. H. Murphy. In 1852 he served as\r\nsurgeon at Fort Snelling, and in 1853 was elected to the territorial\r\nlegislature as a member of the house. In 1854 he was elected probate\r\njudge; in 1857 member of the Democratic wing of the constitutional\r\nconvention, and in 1860 became a member of the state normal board.\r\nDuring the remainder of his life he devoted himself to the practice of\r\nmedicine, but also served the public in many positions of trust. He\r\ndied Dec. 24, 1874. His wife and five children survive him.\r\n\r\nALBERT ALONZO AMES, son of Dr. A. E. and Martha (Pratt) Ames, was born\r\nat Garden Prairie, Illinois, Jan. 18, 1842. He received a high school\r\neducation at Minneapolis, studied medicine at Rush Medical College,\r\nChicago, and graduated February, 1862. In August, 1863, he enlisted in\r\nthe Ninth Minnesota Volunteers, but shortly after was commissioned\r\nassistant surgeon of the Seventh Minnesota Volunteers. He served for\r\nawhile in the Indian campaigns. In the fall of 1863 the regiment was\r\nordered South. In July, 1864, he was commissioned as surgeon of the\r\nSeventh regiment in place of Dr. L. B. Smith, killed at Tupelo. He was\r\nmustered out of service at the close of the war with an excellent\r\nrecord as a physician and surgeon. After the war he devoted himself to\r\nthe practice of his profession and to public services in Minneapolis,\r\nexcepting a period of six years spent in editorial life in California,\r\nfirst on the staff of the _Daily Times_, and later as managing editor\r\nof the _Alta Californian_. At the death of his father, in 1874, he\r\nreturned to Minneapolis and resumed practice. He has filled the\r\nfollowing positions of trust: 1867, member of the Minnesota\r\nlegislature (house); 1875, member of the city council; 1876, mayor of\r\nMinneapolis; 1877, Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor (not\r\nelected); 1886, Democratic candidate for governor (not elected);\r\n1886-87-88, again mayor of Minneapolis. Dr. Ames is a member of such\r\nprominent fraternities as the Masonic, Odd Fellows, Druids, Knights of\r\nPythias, and Order of Elks.\r\n\r\nDr. Ames was married April 21, 1862, to Sarah, daughter of Capt.\r\nRichard Strout, of Minneapolis.\r\n\r\nJESSE AMES was born in Vinalhaven, Maine, Feb. 4, 1808. From the age\r\nof fourteen till his retirement in 1861, Mr. Ames devoted himself to a\r\nseafaring life. At the age of twenty-three he was captain of a\r\nschooner, and afterward of different ships, brigs, barks or schooners,\r\nall of them in the mercantile trade. He made between twenty and thirty\r\nvoyages to Europe, circumnavigated Cape Horn several times, and sailed\r\ntwice round the globe. Few men have seen more of the world. His last\r\nvoyage was from New Zealand to London, where he sold his ship, and,\r\ncoming to America, found him a beautiful home in the North Star State.\r\nHe is a resident of Northfield, and is, with his son John T., the\r\nowner of the well known flouring mills at that place. He was married\r\nOct. 27, 1832, to Margaret Tolman, of Rockland, Maine. They have two\r\nsons, one of whom, John T., is a resident of Northfield. The other\r\nson, Adelbert A., won distinction during the Civil War, leaving the\r\nservice with the brevet rank of major general. Since the war he has\r\nserved as senator from Mississippi, and as governor of that state.\r\n\r\nCADWALLADER C. WASHBURN.--Hon. C. C. Washburn was a man of rare\r\nnobility of character and possessed of an acute and powerful mind. He\r\nused his great talents for the good of the country. He was a man of\r\nphilanthropic impulses and great generosity, as the following\r\nmunificent gifts to the public will attest:\r\n\r\n_First_--To the state of Wisconsin, in 1876, an astronomical\r\nobservatory, located on the university lands at Madison, in style of\r\narchitecture and apparatus to carry into execution the design of the\r\ninstitution, equal, if not superior, to that of any like institution\r\nin the world.\r\n\r\n_Second_--The donation of his \"Edgewood Home,\" near Madison,\r\nWisconsin, for educational purposes.\r\n\r\n_Third_--The generously established school located on the shores of\r\nLake Harriet, near Minneapolis, \"The Washburn Home for Orphans,\" for\r\nthe poor and unfortunate children of Minnesota.\r\n\r\nMr. Washburn was born in Livermore, Maine, April 22, 1818; lived at\r\nhome until 1838, and devoted some time to obtaining a classical\r\neducation. In 1838 and 1839 he taught school and clerked in Hallowell\r\nand Wiscassett, Maine. In the spring of 1839 he came West to\r\nDavenport, Iowa, and was employed a few months with David Dale Owen,\r\non geological work. In 1840 and 1841 he studied law at Rock Island.\r\nIllinois. In 1842 he settled in Mineral Point, Wisconsin, and was\r\nadmitted to practice law at Lancaster, Grant county, in Judge Dunn's\r\ncourt. He continued in practice at Mineral Point; also engaged in real\r\nestate and dealing in land warrants, and in 1852 established the Bank\r\nof Mineral Point. Mr. Washburn was elected representative to the\r\nthirty-fourth, thirty-fifth, thirty-sixth, and fortieth congresses. In\r\nFebruary, 1861, the house appointed a special committee of\r\nthirty-three members on the state of the Union. A majority of the\r\ncommittee reported an amendment to the constitution of the United\r\nStates, making slavery perpetual. Mr. Washburn and others made a\r\nminority report against making slavery perpetual. On this report we\r\nsubjoin his remarks: \"If this Union must be dissolved, whether by\r\npeaceable process or through fire and blood or civil war, we shall\r\nhave the consolation of knowing that when the conflict is over those\r\nwho survive will be what they never have been--inhabitants of a free\r\ncountry.\" Mr. Washburn changed his residence to La Crosse in 1861. He\r\nreceived a colonel's commission to recruit a cavalry regiment that\r\nyear, and subsequently was promoted to the rank of brigadier general.\r\nHe was elected governor of Wisconsin in 1872. In 1876 he erected a\r\nlarge flour mill at Minneapolis, which burned in 1878. It was soon\r\nafter rebuilt. In this mill he introduced the first Hungarian patent\r\nprocess for making flour used in America. Mr. Washburn died at Eureka\r\nSprings, Arkansas, May 14, 1882. His body was brought to Wisconsin and\r\nburied at La Crosse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: W. D. Washburn]\r\n\r\nWILLIAM DREW WASHBURN, the youngest of the Washburn brothers, was born\r\nat Livermore, Maine, Jan. 14, 1831. He worked upon his father's farm\r\nuntil twenty years of age; prepared himself for college by his own\r\nunaided efforts, entered Bowdoin College, and graduated in 1854. He\r\nstudied law and was admitted to the bar in 1857, and in the same year\r\ncame to Minneapolis as agent of the Minneapolis Mill Company, of which\r\nhe became a partner. In 1861 President Lincoln appointed him surveyor\r\ngeneral of Minnesota. During his term of office, which continued four\r\nyears, he lived in St. Paul. On his return to Minneapolis he built a\r\nlarge saw mill and engaged extensively in the lumber trade. He was the\r\nchief mover in the Minneapolis & St. Louis and Minneapolis & Pacific\r\nrailways. He has a large lumber and flour mill at Anoka, and with\r\nothers erected the Palisade flour mill at Minneapolis. In 1878 he was\r\nelected representative to Congress from the Third district and\r\nre-elected in 1880. He has also served in the state legislature. He\r\nwas a principal proprietor of the Minneapolis, Sault Ste. Marie &\r\nAtlantic railway, and was elected president of the company in 1883.\r\nMr. Washburn has been successful in his business ventures, has\r\naccumulated a handsome property, and been liberal in using his means\r\nin the interests of Minneapolis and the State. He is eminently\r\npractical in his business ideas and methods, and affable and\r\nprepossessing in his manners. He married Lizzie Muzzy, of Bangor,\r\nMaine, in 1850, and has two sons and two daughters living.\r\n\r\nJOSEPH CLINTON WHITNEY was born in Springfield, Vermont, April 14,\r\n1818. In 1829 he removed with his parents to Lower Canada, where he\r\nremained till he was twenty years of age. He went to Oberlin, Ohio,\r\n1840; graduated from the college in 1845, and from Union Theological\r\nSeminary in 1849. The same year he removed to Stillwater, where he\r\norganized the First Presbyterian church, of which he served as pastor\r\nuntil 1853, when he was called to the pastorate of the First\r\nPresbyterian church at Minneapolis, where he remained four years. He\r\nremoved to Forest City, Meeker county, but returned to Minneapolis in\r\n1860. In 1862 he enlisted in Company D, Sixth Minnesota Volunteers,\r\nand served three years. In 1865 President Lincoln appointed him\r\nquartermaster with the rank of captain. In 1866 he returned to\r\nMinneapolis and engaged in business. In 1867 he was elected state\r\nsenator from the Fifth district. Mr. Whitney has been greatly\r\ninterested in the cause of education. He was a principal mover in\r\nestablishing the public schools of Minneapolis, of Bennett Seminary\r\nfor Young Ladies, and of Macalester College. He is president of the\r\nboard of Bennett Seminary, and is one of the members of the state\r\nnormal board. He was married July 10, 1849, to Eliza Baird. They have\r\nthree sons and two daughters.\r\n\r\nCHARLES HOAG was born in Sandwich, New Hampshire, in 1808. He received\r\na good education and taught school fifteen years. He came to\r\nMinneapolis in 1852, and occupied various positions of trust, having\r\nbeen a member of the first town council, the second treasurer of\r\nHennepin county, and the superintendent of schools four years,\r\ncommencing with 1870. Mr. Hoag suggested the name of Minneapolis for\r\nthe growing young city of his adoption. He was a man of marked ability\r\nand refinement, and although a strong partisan his many admirable\r\npersonal qualities won the esteem of those who most radically differed\r\nfrom him. He was twice married, his first wife dying in 1871. In 1873\r\nhe was married to Miss Susan F. Jewett who, with a daughter, Mrs. C.\r\nH. Clark, and one son, Levi, survives him. Mr. Hoag died February,\r\n1888.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN STEELE.--No other pioneer has been more prominent in the\r\nearly history of Minneapolis than Franklin Steele. A bold, sagacious,\r\nenterprising man, he came in the very vanguard of civilization, and\r\npromptly and fearlessly availed himself of the splendid opportunities\r\nthat this, then almost unknown, frontier afforded. We have not many\r\ndata of his early life, but his history since he set foot in Fort\r\nSnelling is elsewhere given as a part of the early history of the\r\nsection in which he located, and need not be here repeated.\r\n\r\nFranklin Steele was born in Lancaster county, Pennsylvania. He came\r\nWest by the advice of President Andrew Jackson, and arrived at Fort\r\nSnelling just after the conclusion of the treaty by which the Indians\r\nceded their St. Croix lands to the government; whereupon Mr. Steele\r\nvisited St. Croix Falls, made a claim and proceeded to make further\r\nimprovements, such as building mills, as elsewhere narrated.\r\n\r\nWhen appointed sutler of the army at Fort Snelling, he sold his St.\r\nCroix claims and identified himself thereafter with the interests of\r\nSt. Anthony Falls and the section adjacent thereto, where he made\r\nclaims and improvements. Among other enterprises illustrative of the\r\nfaith of Steele and others in the future greatness of the prospective\r\nriver cities, the fact may be mentioned that an organized company\r\nbuilt a wire suspension bridge over the river just above the falls, a\r\nwork projected while the adjacent lands were still in the hands of the\r\ngovernment, and completed in 1855, at a time when such a structure was\r\nmost needed and advantageous.\r\n\r\nMr. Steele was a man of far more than ordinary ability. Col. J. H.\r\nStevens says of him: \"He has been a good friend to Hennepin county,\r\nand as most of the citizens came here poor they never had to ask Mr.\r\nSteele a second time for a favor. Fortune has favored him, and while\r\nmany a family has reason to feel thankful for his generosity and\r\nkindness, he constantly made money.\" The county of Steele was named\r\nafter him. Mr. Steele was married to Miss Barney, a relative of the\r\ndistinguished naval officer of that name. He died in Minneapolis in\r\n1880.\r\n\r\nROSWELL P. RUSSELL was born in Richland, Vermont, March 15, 1820. His\r\nprivileges for education were limited. He came to Michigan in 1836 and\r\nto Fort Snelling in 1839. He came from Prairie du Chien to the Fort in\r\na mackinaw boat, part of the way on foot over the ice, and suffered\r\nmuch for want of food, sleep and from exposure. Mr. Russell remained\r\nat Fort Snelling until 1845, engaged for two years in the Indian\r\ntrade, made a claim at St. Anthony Falls in 1847, and opened the first\r\nstore, in a log building, at that place. In 1854 he was appointed\r\nreceiver of the land office at Minneapolis. He has since been actively\r\nengaged in farming, merchandising and real estate transactions. He was\r\nthe first chairman of the St. Anthony Falls town board, and has served\r\none term as representative in the state legislature. He was a true and\r\nsteadfast friend to his adopted city. He was married at St. Anthony\r\nFalls, Oct. 3, 1848, to Marion Patch. They have a family of seven sons\r\nand three daughters: Lucy C., wife of W. C. Colbrath; Charles M.,\r\nRoswell P., Mary Bell, wife of F. M. Prince, of Stillwater; Carrie E.,\r\nwife of F. L. Lovejoy, of Fargo, Dakota; Frank and Fred, twin\r\nbrothers; Geo. B. Mc----, died in 1881; William and Edward E.\r\n\r\nHORATIO PHILLIPS VAN CLEVE was born in Princeton, New Jersey, Nov. 22,\r\n1809. He was educated at Princeton College and West Point, graduating\r\nfrom the latter institution in 1831. He served five years in the army,\r\nresigning in 1836. He followed farming and engineering in Michigan\r\nuntil 1856, when he came to Morrison county, Minnesota. In 1861 he\r\nenlisted as a volunteer in the Second Regiment, Minnesota Infantry, of\r\nwhich regiment he was commissioned colonel. He served during the war\r\nand left the service with a major general's commission, and has since\r\nserved as adjutant general of the state of Minnesota. He was the\r\npostmaster of St. Anthony Falls prior to the union of that city with\r\nMinneapolis. He was married to Charlotte O. Clarke, daughter of Maj.\r\nGen. Clarke of the United States Army. They have seven children.\r\n\r\nCHARLOTTE OUISCONSIN VAN CLEVE, a daughter of Gen. Clarke of the\r\nUnited States Army, was born at Fort Crawford, Prairie du Chien,\r\nWisconsin, in 1819. Soon after her birth her father came up the river\r\non a flatboat to the site of Fort Snelling. They were six weeks making\r\nthe voyage. Miss Charlotte grew up amidst military surroundings, and\r\non a remote frontier, and was married at Fort Winnebago, Wisconsin, to\r\nHoratio P. Van Cleve, when she had barely attained the age of sixteen\r\nyears. Her husband resigned his position in the army about the time of\r\nhis marriage, and removed to Michigan, but since 1856 her home has\r\nbeen in Minnesota. Of her children six sons are living in Hennepin\r\ncounty. A daughter is the wife of H. V. Hall, a missionary to the\r\nSandwich Islands. Besides her own family she has reared five orphans.\r\nShe is intellectually active and vigorous, takes great interest in the\r\nreforms of the day, and is a noble specimen of the pioneer women of\r\nthe State. She is the founder of the Bethany Home in Minneapolis. She\r\nhas specially interested herself in the poor, the downtrodden and the\r\noutcast classes of human society, and has exercised in this direction\r\nan untold influence for good.\r\n\r\nARD GODFREY was born at Orono, Maine, Jan. 18, 1813. He came to St.\r\nAnthony Falls in 1847, and was among the first to make improvements in\r\nutilizing the water power furnished by the falls. He built a dam and\r\nmill, and subsequently engaged in lumbering. In 1852 he settled on a\r\nclaim near Minnehaha falls, where he built a saw and grist mill, some\r\nyears later destroyed by fire. He was married in Maine, January,\r\n1838, and has a family of six children. He still lives at his old\r\nhomestead near Minnehaha falls.\r\n\r\nRICHARD CHUTE was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, Sept. 22, 1820. He first\r\nvisited St. Anthony Falls in 1844, and built a trading house. He was\r\none of the firm of W. G. Ewing & Co. In 1854 he located permanently at\r\nthe Falls where he has been engaged in real estate operations, milling\r\nand other branches of business. He has been successful in his\r\nundertakings, and is a man of excellent standing in the community.\r\n\r\nLUCIUS N. PARKER was born in Chester, Vermont, Dec. 11, 1823. He came\r\nto Illinois in his boyhood and remained there till eighteen years of\r\nage, when he came to Marine, Minnesota, and engaged in lumbering. In\r\n1846 he was one of the proprietors of the Osceola (Polk county,\r\nWisconsin) mills. In 1849 he sold out his interest, removed to St.\r\nAnthony Falls and carried the mail between St. Paul and that city. He\r\nremoved to the west side of the river, known now as Minneapolis, and\r\nhas since resided there. He was married to Amanda Huse in 1849.\r\n\r\nCAPT. JOHN ROLLINS was born in March, 1806, at New Sharon, Maine.\r\nWhile in Maine he followed lumbering and hotel keeping. In 1848 he\r\ncame to the Falls and engaged in lumbering, steamboating, milling and\r\nfarming. He was a member of the first territorial council of\r\nMinnesota, in 1849-50. He was married to Betsey Martin at Newport,\r\nMaine, in 1832. They have seven children living. Capt. Rollins died in\r\n1885.\r\n\r\nJOHN G. LENNON was born in Bolton, England, July 6, 1815. He came to\r\nAmerica in 1841 as supercargo of a vessel bound to New Orleans.

The Indians would travel hundreds of miles to\r\n_the place where they sell Minne waukan_ (whisky). The location was\r\nnear the once well known Fountain Cave. The name of \"Pig's Eye\" might\r\nhave been perpetually fastened upon the young city but for the timely\r\narrival of Father Galtier, who gave to it the name of St. Paul,\r\nbecause, as he says in a letter to Bishop Grace, referring to the fact\r\nthat the name St. Peter (Mendota) had already been affixed to a place\r\nsome miles above, \"As the name of St. Paul is generally associated\r\nwith that of St. Peter, and the Gentiles being well represented in the\r\nnew place in the persons of the Indians, I called it 'St. Paul.'\"\r\n\r\nIt does not appear that Father Galtier was ever a resident of St.\r\nPaul, as he only came at stated times to hold services and administer\r\nthe sacraments. The name Pig's Eye was subsequently transferred to a\r\nplace several miles below, where it is still retained. The best known\r\nof the first settlers of St. Paul are B. Gervais, Vetal Guerin and\r\nPierre Bottineau. The two former gave to Father Galtier the ground\r\nnecessary for a church site and cemetery. \"Accordingly,\" writes the\r\ngood father, \"in the month of October logs were prepared and a church\r\nerected so poor that it would well remind one of the stable at\r\nBethlehem. It was destined, however, to be the nucleus of a great\r\ncity. On the first day of November in the same year I blessed the new\r\n_basilica_ and dedicated it to St. Paul, the apostle of nations. I\r\nexpressed a wish at the same time that the settlement would be known\r\nby the same name, and my desire was obtained.\" During the fall of 1841\r\nFather Augustin Ravoux arrived from below and became a resident of\r\nMinnesota and later of St. Paul. In 1841 Rev. B. T. Kavanaugh\r\nestablished a mission at Red Rock. Henry Jackson came from Galena the\r\nsame year, established a trading post and did well. He was afterward a\r\nmember of the first territorial legislature and of the first town\r\ncouncil. Jackson street perpetuates his name. Sergt. Mortimer and\r\nStanislaus Bilanski also came in 1842.\r\n\r\nThe accessions of 1843 were John R. Irvine. C. C. Blanchard, J. W.\r\nSimpson, A. B. Coy, Wm. Hartshorn, A. L. Larpenteur, Scott Campbell,\r\nAntoine Pepin, Alexander Mege, A. R. McLeod, Alexis Clautier, Joseph\r\nGobin, David T. Sloan, Joseph Desmarais, Louis Larrivier and Xavier\r\nDelonais. These mostly engaged in trade. Messrs. Irvine, Blanchard,\r\nHartshorn and Coy, and later, Mege, were associated together. Some of\r\nthe last named accessions of 1843 were Canadian French, half-breeds,\r\nor allied by marriage to the Indians. There were other settlers of\r\nwhom we can find only casual mention, probably transients or\r\nadventurers.\r\n\r\nThe prominent accessions of 1844 were Capt. Louis Robert, Charles\r\nBazille, Wm. Dugas, Francis McCoy and Joseph Hall. Louis Robert was a\r\ntrader, Bazille was a carpenter and built this summer for Capt. Robert\r\nthe first frame house in St. Paul. This house was built of hewn\r\nlumber, sawed lumber not being obtainable. It was on the lower levee,\r\nand was used as a warehouse but was moved to East Fourth street,\r\nwhere, as No. 58, it was still standing a few years ago. Dugas was a\r\nmillwright and built a saw and grist mill on Phalen's creek (spelled\r\nin an old deed Faylin's creek). The mill was a failure. Dugas was a\r\nman of some prominence and represented the New Canada precinct in the\r\nfirst territorial legislature.\r\n\r\nMcCoy and Hall were carpenters. This year the governor of Wisconsin\r\nTerritory appointed Henry Jackson a justice of the peace. Jackson,\r\nbefore his commission arrived, married an eager couple by bond, they\r\ngiving bond to reappear when he should receive his commission and be\r\nlegally united. Jackson was justice of the peace, postmaster, hotel\r\nkeeper, legislator, and clerk of court combined in one.\r\n\r\nThis fall Father Galtier was transferred to Keokuk and Father A.\r\nRavoux took charge of the churches at Mendota and St. Paul. Rev. J.\r\nHurlbut, a Methodist missionary, held the first Protestant service,\r\nusing the house of Henry Jackson for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThe first deed on record bears date of April 23, 1844, and transfers\r\nfrom Henry Jackson, St. Croix county, Wisconsin Territory, to William\r\nHartshorn, of St. Louis, Missouri, for a consideration of $1,000, half\r\nof the following tract of land in St. Croix county, Wisconsin\r\nTerritory, being the place where the said Jackson now lives, situate\r\nimmediately on the Mississippi river and known as the St. Paul\r\nlanding, containing three acres, with all buildings and improvements\r\nthereon. The permanent accessions of 1845 were Francis Chenevert,\r\nDavid Benoit, Leonard H. La Roche, Francis Robert, Augustus and David\r\nB. Freeman, W. G. Carter and Charles Cavileer. La Roche was a\r\ncarpenter, but engaged in trade. He bought the land on which the\r\nMerchants Hotel now stands for $165, and the year following built a\r\ncabin of tamarack logs, which was known as the St. Paul House. This\r\nproperty he sold to S. P. Folsom. La Roche died at Crow Wing in 1859.\r\n\r\nW. G. Carter, better known as \"Gib\" Carter, was a member of the\r\nStillwater convention in 1848. He died in 1852. Francis Robert was a\r\nyounger brother of Louis Robert. He died in 1849, from an injury\r\nreceived while running the St. Croix rapids in a birch canoe.\r\nChenevert clerked for Capt. Robert. He was unmarried, and died in\r\n1865. Of Benoit little or nothing is known. The Freeman brothers were\r\nengaged in trade in connection with Hartshorn and Randall. David died\r\nin 1850, and was buried by the Odd Fellows, the first Odd Fellow\r\nfuneral in the Territory. Augustus Freeman died in New York. Cavileer\r\nwas a saddler, and was connected at first with the Red Rock mission.\r\nHe was territorial librarian for awhile, and is now a resident of\r\nPembina. Miss Matilda Ramsey opened a school (the first in St. Paul)\r\nand taught a short time, when she was married to Alexander Mege, and\r\nthe school was abandoned.\r\n\r\nAlexander R. McLeod, who came from Selkirk settlement in 1837 with\r\nPierre Bottineau, erected in 1845 and 1846 a log house between the\r\nCatholic church and Jackson's store. This was the first house built in\r\nSt. Paul expressly for a hotel. It was afterward enlarged and called\r\nthe Central House, and was kept by Robert Kennedy and others. The\r\nsecond deed on record bears date of May 1, 1845, and transfers, for a\r\nconsideration of $500, from William Douglass to H. H. Sibley, of\r\nClayton county, Iowa, lands situate on what is known as Faylin's\r\n(Phalen's) creek, and more fully known as Faylin's falls, 100 acres,\r\nwhere said Douglass now lives. This was a mortgage deed. A subsequent\r\ndeed conveys the same premises from Edward Faylin to Wm. Douglass, for\r\na consideration of $70. In February, 1846, a quitclaim deed conveys\r\nthe same tract to Alexander McLeod.\r\n\r\nThe settlers in 1846 were William H. and William Randall, Jr., father\r\nand son, James McBoal, Thos. S. Odell, John Banfil, Harley D. White,\r\nDavid Faribault, Louis Denoyer, Jo Monteur, and Charles Roleau.\r\nRandall, Sr., engaged in trade and became immensely rich, but was\r\nwrecked in the financial panic of 1857. He died in 1861. Randall, Jr.,\r\nis best remembered as an artist and caricaturist of no mean ability.\r\nHe died in 1851. McBoal was also an artist, the first who pursued\r\nthat calling in St. Paul. He was a member of the territorial council\r\nin 1849-50, and was adjutant general of the Territory during Gov.\r\nRamsey's administration. He died in Mendota in 1862.\r\n\r\nOdell had been a soldier, but on being mustered out at Fort Snelling\r\ncame to St. Paul. He died in 1879. We have made mention of White in\r\nbiographical sketches. Crittenden went to Crow Wing and represented\r\nthe Twenty-first district in the first state legislature. Denoyer\r\nmarried a sister of Louis Robert and in 1850 removed to Belle Plaine.\r\nDavid Faribault was a son of Jean Baptiste Faribault. He now resides\r\nin Dakota. Banfil removed to Manomin, and represented his district as\r\nsenator in the first state legislature.\r\n\r\nThe writer of these sketches visited St. Paul in 1846, and was\r\nentertained at Jackson's hotel, which he well remembers as a log\r\nbuilding, one story high, with store and post office in the east end,\r\na dining room in the west end, with small, low sleeping rooms in the\r\nrear. The hotel stood on a romantic elevation, a precipitious bluff,\r\nand commanded a magnificent view of the river and valley. Louis\r\nRobert's tamarack pole store was located east of Jackson's, under the\r\nbluff, and directly on the bank of the river, a good steamboat landing\r\nin front. West of Jackson's was J. W. Simpson's store, and still\r\nfurther west the store of Faribault & Co., beyond which were two small\r\ndwellings, all these buildings fronting the river. Still further west,\r\nAlexander McLeod was building a handsome hewed log house. On the next\r\nrise of ground stood the Catholic church. On the next plateau the\r\nstore of Wm. Hartshorn, and near a small creek the dwelling of John R.\r\nIrvine. There were two residences on a plateau a short distance north\r\nof Jackson's hotel. There were in all five stores, one tavern and a\r\nfew dwellings, mostly built of logs. A few United States soldiers and\r\nIndians were lounging about the stores, some drunk, some sober. Such\r\nwas St. Paul in 1846. The settlers of 1847 were Jacob W. Bass, Harriet\r\nE. Bishop, Benj. W. Brunson, Dr. J. J. Dewey, G. A. Fonrnier, Simeon\r\nP. Folsom, W. H. Forbes, Aaron Foster, Daniel Hopkins, Parsons K.\r\nJohnson, C. P. V. Lull, and W. C. Renfro. Bass and Johnson had been in\r\nthe lumber business at Chippewa Falls. On arriving at St. Paul Mr.\r\nBass leased a hotel on the corner of Third and Jackson streets, known\r\nas the St. Paul House. He was appointed postmaster in 1849, and in\r\n1852 opened a commission and forwarding warehouse on the levee. Mr.\r\nBrunson was a surveyor, and, assisted by his brother, Ira B., laid off\r\nthe town plat of St. Paul, also a plat known as Brunson's addition, in\r\nthe fall of 1847. He was a member of the first and second territorial\r\nlegislatures, and justice of the peace for several years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nMiss Bishop was one of the company of teachers sent West by Gov.\r\nSlade. She organized the first permanent day school and the first\r\nSunday-school in St. Paul. The school house was a cabin on the corner\r\nof Third and St. Peter streets. Miss Bishop, later Mrs. McConkey, was\r\nthe author of a valuable book of frontier sketches entitled \"Floral\r\nHomes.\" She died in 1884.\r\n\r\nOf Mr. Forbes mention is made in biographical sketches. Aaron Foster\r\ncame from Stillwater. He was a carpenter by trade. He married Fanny\r\nMortimer, daughter of Sergt. Mortimer. He died in 1864. S. P. Folsom\r\nis mentioned in biographical sketches. Dr. Dewey, the first practicing\r\nphysician in St. Paul, was a member of the first territorial\r\nlegislature, and established the first drug store in Minnesota.\r\nParsons Johnson, a descendant on his mother's side of Jonathan Carver,\r\nengaged in tailoring, the first of his trade in St. Paul. He was a\r\nmember of the first territorial legislature.\r\n\r\nCornelius V. P. Lull was a carpenter. He served as sheriff in 1849,\r\nand still lives in the city. Daniel Hopkins engaged in general\r\nmerchandising. He died in 1852. W. O. Renfro, a cousin of Henry\r\nJackson, had studied medicine, was a young man of ability but addicted\r\nto drinking habits. The winter after his arrival he wandered forth,\r\nsuffering from _mania a potu_, and froze to death near the bend in\r\nPhalen's creek.\r\n\r\nThis year was memorable for the organization of a regular steamboat\r\nline from Galena to Mendota and Fort Snelling. The steamer Argo was\r\npurchased for the trade. M. W. Lodwick was made commander and Russell\r\nBlakely, clerk. The Argo was designed to make weekly trips, but sank\r\nbefore the close of the season, and the Dr. Franklin was purchased to\r\ntake her place the ensuing year. St. Paul had not increased largely in\r\npopulation this year. One hotel and two dwellings had been built. Some\r\nprogress had been made in farming and gardening, and there was much\r\nlively talk on the subject of making claims. The prospective\r\nseparation of Minnesota into a territory, and the opening of the\r\ncountry for settlement gave a new impetus to business. The Wisconsin\r\nconvention for the adoption of a state constitution was held Dec. 13,\r\n1847. Its effects, however, were not greatly felt until toward the\r\nmiddle of the ensuing year.\r\n\r\nAmong the prominent accessions in 1848 to the population were Henry M.\r\nRice, Henry C. Rhodes, David Olmsted, W. D. Phillips, E. A. C. Hatch,\r\nBushrood W. Lott, W. H. Nobles, Nathan Myrick, A. H. Cavender,\r\nBenjamin F. Hoyt, William Freeborn, David Lambert, W. C. Morrison, Lot\r\nMoffett, and W. D. Brown. Of these Rice, Noble, Hoyt and Myrick are\r\nreferred to in biographical sketches. Mr. Olmsted was a trader, and in\r\nthe summer of the year 1848 established a trading post at Long\r\nPrairie, whither the Winnebagoes had removed. He was a member of the\r\nfirst and second territorial councils, and the first mayor of St.\r\nPaul, in 1854. He removed to Winona in 1855, and died in 1861. Olmsted\r\ncounty, Minnesota, is named in his honor. W. D. Phillips, better known\r\nas \"Billy\" Phillips, was a somewhat eccentric character who passed for\r\nawhile as a lawyer in St. Paul, and in 1856 drifted off into a\r\nclerkship at Washington, since which time nothing has been heard of\r\nhim. E. A. C. Hatch was appointed Indian agent to the Blackfeet\r\nIndians by President Pierce in 1856. In 1863 he was commissioned as\r\nmajor in the volunteer service, and acquitted himself creditably.\r\nWhile stationed at Pembina, by strategy he captured the insurgent\r\nIndians, Shakopee and Medicine Bottle, who were hanged at Fort\r\nSnelling in 1865. He died in 1881. H. O. Rhodes was engaged in trade\r\nwith David Olmsted. He died in California some years ago. A. H.\r\nCavender was a blacksmith and wagonmaker on Robert street in 1849.\r\n\r\nWm. Freeborn was quite a prominent citizen and member of the town\r\ncouncil. He is better known as one of the founders of Red Wing, to\r\nwhich place he removed in 1853. He represented his district in the\r\nterritorial councils of 1854, 1855, 1856 and 1857. He removed to\r\nCalifornia in 1862. Freeborn county is named for him. David Lambert, a\r\nprominent member of the Stillwater convention, was a young man of\r\npromise, but addicted to drink. In 1849, while suffering from a\r\ndelirious paroxysm induced by drink, he jumped from the deck of a\r\nsteamer and was drowned. W. C. Morrison originally came from New\r\nYork, thence to Cleveland, Detroit, Chicago, Galena, Dubuque, and\r\nother places and lastly to St. Paul, where he is widely and favorably\r\nknown as a business man. Lot Moffett will be remembered as the builder\r\nand proprietor of the picturesque heap of rocks known as \"Moffett's\r\nCastle,\" where he kept a temperance hotel for several years. He was a\r\nman of patriarchal appearance, wearing a long, white beard. He was\r\nknown as an honest, kind hearted, benevolent man. He died in 1870. W.\r\nB. Brown came from Wisconsin and purchased the corner on which the\r\nWarner block now stands. He died some years ago. To enumerate the\r\naccessions to the population in 1849 would require more space than we\r\nare allowed. The fact that St. Paul was this year designated as the\r\nterritorial capital brought in a great number of official personages,\r\nand an army of traders, boarding house keepers, builders and\r\nadventurers. Heretofore Mendota had seemed to be the objective point\r\nof steam navigation. It also aspired to be the capital of the new\r\nterritory. Senator Douglas, chairman of the committee on territories,\r\nfavored Mendota. Gen. Sibley, the territorial delegate, favored St.\r\nPaul, and earnestly solicited the senator to yield, which, along with\r\nthe personal appeals of H. M. Rice, finally secured his acquiescence,\r\nand the bill to form Minnesota Territory, with St. Paul as its\r\ncapital, finally passed March 3, 1849. The news, however, did not\r\nreach the capital until April 9th, it having been brought up on the\r\nDr. Franklin, No. 2, the first boat of the season.\r\n\r\nOn May 27th the newly appointed governor, Alexander Ramsey, arrived\r\nwith his wife, but not being able to obtain accommodations in St. Paul\r\nwent for the time to Mendota, where they were entertained by Hon. H.\r\nH. Sibley. Every succeeding boat was crowded with emigrants. A\r\nnewspaper was an immediate necessity. The first steps had been taken\r\nthe year before by Dr. A. Randall, of Owen's Geological Survey. Dr.\r\nRandall was not immediately able to carry his project into effect, and\r\nnot till April 27, 1849, did the promised paper, the _Minnesota\r\nRegister_, appear. The first copy had, however, been printed at\r\nCincinnati two weeks earlier. Of this paper Maj. John P. Owens was\r\npublisher.\r\n\r\nThe first number of the second paper in the city was issued April\r\n28th. This was the St. Paul _Pioneer_, James M. Goodhue, publisher and\r\neditor. These papers and others established later became faithful\r\nchroniclers of the progress of the city, and invaluable as historical\r\ndocuments.\r\n\r\nThe first number of Goodhue's paper, the St. Paul _Pioneer_, bearing\r\ndate of April 28, 1849, contains what we may designate as the earliest\r\nnews. We cull a few items that maybe of interest to antiquarians:\r\n\r\nIt announces Congressman Sibley's return from Washington, Rev. E. D.\r\nNeill's removal to St. Paul, and that the latter would preach the\r\nfollowing Sabbath at the school house.\r\n\r\nAn editorial paragraph calls attention to the fact that the _Pioneer_\r\nis printed in a building situated on Third street near Robert, and\r\nthat the building has five hundred apertures through which the\r\ndaylight is streaming.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of steamer Franklin, No. 2, bringing the tidings of the\r\npassage of the bill organizing Minnesota Territory, is announced. The\r\nsteamer was greeted by a large crowd of eager and excited citizens,\r\nwhose shouts re-echoed amongst the adjacent hills.\r\n\r\nArrival of steamers Cora and Dr. Franklin, No. 1, is announced.\r\n\r\nThe following advertisements will show who were the most enterprising\r\nof the early settlers:\r\n\r\nH. Jackson, postmaster; D. Lambert, real estate dealer; W. H. Nobles,\r\nwagonmaker; J. J. Dewey, M.D.; W. D. Phillips, lawyer; J. Monteur, D.\r\nC. Taylor, blacksmiths; J. R. Irvine, plasterer; B. L. Sellers,\r\nstonemason; Lot Moffett, Anson Northrup, hotel keepers; James Pomeroy,\r\nFrancis McCoy, house builders; McBoal & Gilbert, stock dealers; Henry\r\nJackson, W. H. Forbes, Daniel Hopkins, Freeman, Larpenteur & Co., J.\r\nW. Simpson, Olmsted & Rhodes, Fuller & Brothers, R. P. Russell,\r\nmerchants.\r\n\r\nA road notice completes the list.\r\n\r\nAmong the prominent citizens who arrived in 1849, David Day became the\r\nfirst register of deeds in Ramsey county. He served in the territorial\r\nhouse in 1852 and 1853, and was speaker during the last session. He\r\nserved as postmaster from 1874 to 1887. D. F. Brawley established the\r\nfirst brickyard in the Territory, and made the brick for the first\r\nbrick building north of Prairie du Chien, which was built by Rev. E.\r\nD. Neill. Willoughby & Powers introduced the first stage coaches, and\r\nestablished the first livery stable. Nathaniel McLean came as a Sioux\r\nIndian Agent and served four years. He died in 1871, aged eighty-four\r\nyears. Henry F. Masterman, a prominent lawyer, died in 1883. J. D.\r\nCrittenden, who served in the late war and rose to the position of\r\ncolonel. Orlando Simmons, a useful citizen and sound jurist, still\r\nlives in St. Paul. Wm. Hollinshead, a brother-in-law of Edmund and H.\r\nM. Rice, died some time in the '50s. J. W. Bond was the author of the\r\nfirst history of Minnesota. Chauncey Hobart was chaplain of the first\r\nlegislature. John B. Spencer, carpenter and contractor, built the\r\nfirst breakwater and dock at Duluth.\r\n\r\nThomas Foster became editor of the _Minnesotian_, and subsequently\r\nissued a paper at Duluth. He gave the name of \"The Zenith City of the\r\nUnsalted Sea\" to Duluth. He was too much of a critic to be popular. He\r\ndied near Washington, District of Columbia, in 1884. The first\r\nMasonic, Odd Fellows and Sons of Temperance lodges were organized this\r\nyear. The Bank of St. Croix, with headquarters at St. Paul, was\r\nestablished this year. Its paper was the first issued in the form of\r\nbank notes in the city and Territory. Nevertheless it was a fraud. Its\r\npaper was quoted in New York at one per cent. The proprietors were\r\nYoung & Sawyer.\r\n\r\nFor a few terse comparisons and statistics with regard to the St. Paul\r\nof the past and of the present we are indebted to a writer in the \"Soo\r\nLine edition\" of the _St. Croix Standard_:\r\n\r\n\"Twenty-six years ago there were no railroads in St. Paul, now there\r\nare 26 trunk lines entering the city, with over 3,000 miles of track\r\nand more than 20,000 miles of mileage, 90,000 cars in use and 100,000\r\nmen employed. Beside this is the river trade, which employs two lines\r\nof boats and affords a very considerable commerce to St. Paul. In the\r\nmanufacturing interests St. Paul has shown a great increase, and in\r\nevery department of trade manufactories are springing up in all\r\ndirections, and the business has already reached the large sum of\r\n$45,000,000, with not less than 1,200 factories and 22,000 men\r\nemployed. Forty-six hotels accommodate the traveling public. The fire\r\ndepartment is one of the best in the West, consisting of 8 steam fire\r\nengines, 7 chemical engines, hose carts, 159 men, 78 horses, etc., and\r\nthe value of all the property belonging to the fire department is\r\n$316,367. The city is abundantly supplied with good, pure water,\r\nobtained from several lakes. One year ago there were 1,800 miles of\r\nmains and 1,000 new water connections, so it is safe to say that at\r\npresent there are 2,000 miles of mains and 1,200 connections.

PAUL.\r\n\r\nThe flourishing suburb of West St. Paul is rapidly approaching\r\nmetropolitan dimensions. The original settlement took place almost\r\nsimultaneously with that of St. Paul, but its growth until late years\r\nhas not been rapid. It was originally within the limits of Dakota\r\ncounty, but that portion included in its plat has been annexed to\r\nRamsey county, and West St. Paul has become a part of St. Paul and has\r\nbeen placed under the municipal government of that city. The city is\r\nconnected with St. Paul by two free bridges for carriages and\r\npedestrians and by several railroad bridges.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOWNS OF RAMSEY COUNTY.\r\n\r\nAfter the state organization in 1858, Ramsey county was subdivided\r\ninto the following towns: Little Canada, McLean, Mounds View, Reserve,\r\nRose, St. Paul, and White Bear. From year to year the city of St. Paul\r\nhas made encroachments upon the towns adjacent--Little Canada, McLean,\r\nReserve, and Rose--until they have been in part or wholly absorbed. Of\r\nthe remaining towns we shall refer only to White Bear, which, owing\r\nto the beauty of its lake scenery and its attractiveness as a place of\r\npopular resort, deserves special mention.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE BEAR.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear, the northeastern township of Ramsey county, contains\r\nthirty-six sections. Its surface is agreeably diversified with lakes.\r\nAbout six sections in all are occupied by these lakes, of which there\r\nare several large and beautiful ones, among which may be mentioned\r\nWhite Bear, Bald Eagle, Pleasant, Lambert's, Vadnais, Birch, Goose,\r\nOtter, etc. The surface is undulating, and in no place actually hilly,\r\nwhile there is much level and very desirable land. Extensive meadows\r\nborder some of the lakes, and are found in most of the intervales\r\nwatered by running streams. These produce enormous crops of hay.\r\nPortions of these marshy localities are thickly grown with tamaracks,\r\nwhich were invaluable to the early settler, furnishing him with a\r\nsupply of logs and poles for his improvements. The timber consists\r\nprincipally of red, white and black oak, sugar maple, tamarack,\r\npoplar, elm, elder, and ash.\r\n\r\nThe township derives its name from White Bear lake. This lake was so\r\nnamed, it is asserted, by the Dakota Indians, a tradition existing\r\namongst them that a grizzly bear once made its appearance on the\r\nisland, with which one of their bravest hunters engaged in mortal\r\nconflict, each slaying the other. The Indians called this a grizzly,\r\npolar or white bear, and named an adjacent locality \"Mah-to-me-di\" or\r\n(M'de), _i. e._, Mahto, gray polar bear, and M'de, lake. It is not\r\nprobable, however, that a polar bear ever reached this spot, and a\r\nvisit from a grizzly is nearly as improbable. Indian legends are very\r\nfrequently made to order by those who succeed them as owners of the\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\nNot much is known of White Bear prior to 1851. No human habitations,\r\nsave those of Indians, were to be seen. There were no roads to this\r\nregion, and none nearer than Little Canada. The lake itself seems to\r\nhave been little known to white men.\r\n\r\nJ. Fletcher Williams, in a sketch contributed to the _Pioneer_, and to\r\nwhich we are indebted for many of our statements, says that Hugh I.\r\nVance, a typo employed in the _Pioneer_ office at that time, was\r\nprobably about the first settler of White Bear; that in the spring of\r\n1851 he wended his way to this region in search of a claim, selected\r\na piece of land on Bald Eagle lake, erected a cabin, resided here with\r\nhis family several years, and was probably the first man to drive a\r\nplowshare in this locality. Mr. Vance joined the Union Army in 1861,\r\nand with his two sons was killed in Missouri the year following. In\r\nthe spring of 1851 V. B. Barnum selected a tract on the south shore of\r\nWhite Bear lake, and hired Geo. O. Nichols to run out the lines. Mr.\r\nBarnum entered one hundred and seventy-five acres. On this land he\r\nbuilt a cabin near the present Leip House, which burned down in 1857.\r\nJas. B. Clewett, one of the pioneers of St. Paul as early as 1840,\r\ndrove his stakes at White Bear in the spring of 1851. He afterward\r\nbuilt a house on the island, where he yet resides, a mile north of the\r\nlake. Soon after Wm. Freeborn and B. F. Hoyt entered a tract of land\r\nin sections 13 and 14. Isaac Banta built a cabin on it, near the point\r\nby the island, resided there three or four years, and moved to Forest\r\nLake. This land was afterward bought by the Murray family. Thomas\r\nMilner came in about the same time. Daniel Getty came and located on\r\nthe east side of the lake at a later day, becoming a resident of the\r\nvillage proper, of which he is now postmaster, superintendent of the\r\nSunday-school, elder in the church, school trustee, etc.\r\n\r\nMr. Barnum opened a hotel, which he kept till 1856, and then sold out\r\nto John M. Lamb. In 1855 James F. Murray, his three sons and O. R.\r\nStratton settled at White Bear. W. W. Webber, John Aubery, Joseph\r\nFreeman, Ross Wilkinson, Frank Perfect, Fred Whittaker, George\r\nStarbuck, Duncan Ross, Charlie A. Morgan, and others came here in\r\n1857. The early settlers were much disturbed by roving bands of\r\nChippewa and Sioux Indians. White Bear being debatable ground, and\r\nsometimes a battlefield between hostile parties. The Sioux claimed the\r\nright, under the treaty of 1851, to hunt, fish and gather berries and\r\nrice in that region. In the fall of 1855 a party of Sioux from Kaposia\r\nwent by the lake on a hunting expedition. Near Oneka lake, a few miles\r\nabove, they fell in with some Chippewas, one of whom they killed and\r\nscalped, but had two of their own number mortally wounded. Returning,\r\nthey camped on Goose lake, just about where St. John's church was\r\nfirst built, and had a scalp dance, lasting two days and nights. It\r\nwas from time immemorial a grand battle field for them. Hardly a foot\r\nof the soil around the lake but what has been ensanguined with the\r\nblood of the hereditary foes. Many are the tales told of their\r\nencounters. \"Spirit Island\" seems to have been the hardest fought\r\nspot, and to this day it is honeycombed with the remains of rifle\r\npits, redoubts and earth works made by the contending parties, while\r\ninnumerable bodies of the slain have enriched its soil. It is a\r\nperfect Golgotha--an island cemetery. If but a fraction of these\r\nsavage combats and sieges were truly narrated, no romance could equal\r\nit in thrilling interest. These fierce combats continued as late as\r\n1855.\r\n\r\nMiss Mary Stiles, daughter of William Stiles, was the first white\r\nchild born at White Bear. Miss Mary E. Barnum was married to Richard\r\nMcLagan--being the first wedding which occurred at White Bear. 'Squire\r\nJacob J. Noah, justice of the peace of St. Paul, tied the knot.\r\n\r\nThe first death was that of Clara Murray, aged four years, daughter of\r\nMr. and Mrs. J. C. Murray, in July, 1856. J. G. Riheldaffer preached\r\nat the funeral service at Mr. Murray's house the first sermon in the\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\nA lay Methodist named Hoffman held services on the Sabbath several\r\ntimes at Barnum's hotel.\r\n\r\nA Baptist clergyman from Diamond Bluff, Wisconsin, named Messer, also\r\noccasionally held services in the early days, at the school house, a\r\nlog house built in 1857.\r\n\r\nThe Episcopal church of St. John in the Wilderness was built in 1861\r\nand consecrated in August of the same year. It was located at the\r\nlower end of the lake, but in 1874 was moved to its present site on\r\nClarke avenue.\r\n\r\nThe Presbyterian church was organized May 28, 1864, with eight\r\nmembers, two of whom were elected ruling elders, James F. Murray and\r\nDaniel Getty. The corner stone of the present church edifice was laid\r\nNov. 8, 1871, and the foundation laid in the following spring. The\r\nchurch was completed in 1872.\r\n\r\nA Catholic church was built in 1879, on a block between First and\r\nSecond streets and Bald Eagle avenue, in which services are held every\r\ntwo weeks.\r\n\r\nThe post office of White Bear was established in November, 1859, and\r\nJ. C. Murray appointed postmaster.\r\n\r\nThe township of White Bear was organized May 11, 1858, with the\r\nfollowing officers: Clerk, G. Schnabel; supervisor, J. F. Murray;\r\nassessor, V. B. Barnum; justices of the peace, J. R. Clewett and Alex.\r\nPepin.\r\n\r\nThe village is easy of access, and abundantly supplied with railroad\r\nfacilities. The St. Paul & Duluth Railroad Company has built a double\r\ntrack to St. Paul. This company built a road to Stillwater known as\r\nthe Stillwater & White Bear railroad. There is in addition to this\r\nroad an extension to Minneapolis known as the Minneapolis & White Bear\r\nrailroad. The Sault Ste. Marie passes through the north part of the\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE BEAR LAKE\r\n\r\nIs one of the most famous pleasure resorts in the vicinity of St.\r\nPaul. Its clear waters, gently sloping wooded shores, and the entire\r\nabsence of marsh or swamp lands adjoining, render the situation at\r\nonce pleasant and salubrious. It has an extreme length of 6-1/2 miles,\r\nand a width of 2-3/4. It has, according to survey meanders, a shore\r\nline of over 20 miles, and its area is 3,940 acres, or 62 square\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nBeautiful parks surround the lake. Prominent among these are Wildwood\r\nPark and Mahtomedi, the latter renowned as a camp ground, and later as\r\nthe site of a summer school, modeled after that at Chautauqua, and one\r\nof a system of schools of which the Chautauqua school is the principal\r\nand central institution. Spirit island, connected with the mainland by\r\na bridge, is also a charming resort.\r\n\r\nThe lake shore is crowded with hotels and cottages for the use of\r\nsummer visitors. Among these the Leip House is especially worthy of\r\nmention, the proprietor having beautified the grounds and built around\r\nthe hotel a small village of cottages for excursionists. Other houses\r\nare the Ramaley, the Williams, the Chateaugay, the Dellwood, etc.,\r\nwith pleasant surroundings. The appearance of this resort during the\r\nsummer months is one of great animation. Tourists and summer visitors\r\ncrowd the hotel, or gather in groups along the lake shore, while the\r\nlake is dotted with their sailing vessels. A small steamer makes\r\nregular trips to points of interest about the lake.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear Lake village was incorporated by the legislature in 1881,\r\nthe following being chosen as the first officers under their charter:\r\nDaniel Getty, chairman of council; James C. Murray, Luke H. Bacon,\r\nAbel E. Leaman, and Fred W. Benson, councilmen; B. E. McGurk,\r\nrecorder; H. K. Getty, treasurer; Wm. Clark, village justice; Reuben\r\nClewett, marshal.\r\n\r\nDANIEL GETTY was born in the north of Ireland in 1826. His ancestors\r\nwere Scotch-Irish. He came with his parents to Philadelphia in 1832;\r\nwas educated in the common schools, and learned the trade of a cabinet\r\nmaker. He came to White Bear in 1855, and opened the first store in\r\nthe place. He has four sons associated with him in business. He has\r\ndone much to promote the prosperity of White Bear, and by enterprise\r\nand close attention to business, both as a merchant and a dealer in\r\nreal estate, he has been successful.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUTH ST. PAUL\r\n\r\nIs located in the northeastern corner of Dakota county, four and a\r\nhalf miles below St. Paul, the site of the Presbyterian and Methodist\r\nmissions of old Kaposia. It is situated on a plateau considerably\r\nabove high water mark, in the rear of which the grounds rise gradually\r\nto a rich agricultural plain. It is connected with St. Paul by an\r\nhourly motor line of cars. It has communication with St. Paul by the\r\nChicago, St. Paul & Kansas City railway, and also has communication by\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe famous St. Paul Union Stockyards are located here, and occupy two\r\nhundred acres of land. This great enterprise was founded by A. B.\r\nStickney and Ansel Oppenheim, president of the company. W. M. Littell\r\nis general superintendent; Arnold Kalman, secretary and treasurer. The\r\nstockyards were located here in 1886, and now (1888) possess a capital\r\nof $1,500,000 in grounds and necessary buildings pertaining to such an\r\nenterprise. There are eight miles of railroad track upon the grounds.\r\nThe stock is brought from Montana, Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and\r\nIowa by railroad.\r\n\r\nThe city was organized in 1887, with the following board of officers;\r\nJoseph H. Lawrence, mayor; George W. Wentworth, Philip Crowley, J. W.\r\nMcGrath, and Irwin Marshall, aldermen.\r\n\r\nA post office was established in 1888, of which H. M. Littell is\r\npostmaster.\r\n\r\nThe city embraces South Park, and there are five churches, English and\r\nGerman Methodist, a Congregational and two Baptist churches.\r\n\r\nAn electric motor line is being established. The city of South St.\r\nPaul has about 6,000 inhabitants. Its progress is upward.\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTH ST. PAUL.\r\n\r\nThis rapidly growing suburb of St. Paul is situated on the shores of\r\nSilver lake, a lovely sheet of water lying six miles northeast of the\r\ncourt house. The grounds about the lake were converted into farms soon\r\nafter the settlement of St. Paul. In 1886 the Wisconsin Central\r\nRailroad Company extended their St. Paul branch through the\r\nneighborhood. Capt. H. A. Castle established suburban residences near\r\nthe lake. In March, 1887, the North St. Paul Land Company was formed\r\nfor the purpose of encouraging manufactures and furnishing homes and\r\nfacilities for business. Their plant was located on the farm of Capt.\r\nCastle. The company consists of H. A. Castle, Lane K. Stone, Frederick\r\nDriscoll, W. S. Morton, and George A. Sexias. The capital stock of the\r\ncompany was fixed at $1,000,000. Under their enterprising management\r\ntwenty miles of street has been graded, a boulevard extended around\r\nthe lake, five miles of sidewalk completed and numerous cottages\r\nerected. A railroad depot has been built at a cost of $8,000; two\r\nhotels and fifteen manufacturing establishments have been erected.\r\nThere are (in May, 1888) 3,000 inhabitants, with eight church\r\norganizations and six buildings, and a school house, built at a cost\r\nof $11,000. The growth of this village since its commencement in 1887\r\nhas been remarkable.\r\n\r\nNew, populous and important suburbs of St. Paul are Merriam Park, St.\r\nAnthony Park, and St. Paul Park in Washington county.\r\n\r\nThe following table gives the population of St. Paul from 1838 to May,\r\n1888.\r\n\r\nYEAR.

GEN. HENRY H. SIBLEY.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nBIOGRAPHICAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY HASTINGS SIBLEY.--The father of Gen. Sibley, Judge Solomon\r\nSibley, of Massachusetts, was a well known pioneer of the Northwest.\r\nHe settled in Ohio in 1795, but two years later removed to Michigan,\r\nwhich he represented as delegate to Congress in 1800. In 1799 he\r\nserved as member of the first legislature of the Northwest Territory.\r\nHe was judge of the supreme court from 1824 to 1836, and died in 1846,\r\nuniversally lamented. The mother of Gen. Sibley was the daughter of\r\nCol. Ebenezer Sproat, and a granddaughter of Commodore Whipple of the\r\nAmerican Navy. She was a cultured lady, of unusual personal beauty and\r\nof rare accomplishments. She was married to Judge Sibley in 1802, and\r\ndied at Detroit Jan. 22, 1851. Henry H. Sibley was born in Detroit,\r\nMichigan, Feb. 20, 1811. He received an academic education, and two\r\nyears' tuition in the classics. In 1828 he came to the Sault Ste.\r\nMarie and secured employment as a clerk. In 1829 he entered the\r\nservice of the American Fur Company at Mackinaw. In 1834 he came to\r\nthe mouth of St. Peter's river, to the post afterward known as\r\nMendota, as the agent of the American Fur Company. He made the journey\r\nfrom Prairie du Chien, a distance of nearly three hundred miles, on\r\nhorseback. At that time there was but a single civilized habitation on\r\nthe way. In 1836 he built a stone house at Mendota, the first in\r\nMinnesota, in which he resided twenty-four years. This house is still\r\nstanding. He continued to act as agent for the American Fur Company\r\nuntil called to act as delegate to Congress for Wisconsin Territory\r\nwest of the St. Croix, in 1848. Mr. Sibley, when elected, was a\r\ncitizen of Mendota, Clayton county, Iowa, but the question of\r\ncitizenship was not raised. He was recognized as the ablest and best\r\nrepresentative that could be chosen for the difficult task of securing\r\nthe organization of Minnesota Territory. In this he was successful.\r\nIn the fall of 1849 he was re-elected as a delegate from the new\r\nterritory he had been instrumental in forming, and served in that\r\ncapacity until March 4, 1853, rendering the Territory important\r\nservices. In 1855 he was elected a member of the Minnesota territorial\r\nlegislature from Dakota county, and in 1857 was a member and president\r\nof the Democratic wing of the constitutional convention. On the\r\nadmission of Minnesota as a state he was elected governor, taking his\r\nseat May 24, 1858. His term expired Jan. 1, 1860. Aug. 19, 1862, his\r\nsuccessor, Gov. Ramsey, appointed him commander of the forces sent to\r\nquell the Sioux outbreak. He marched with his command in pursuit of\r\nthe Indians, defeating them in several skirmishes and battles,\r\nreleasing 250 captives held by them and capturing about 2,000\r\nprisoners, over 400 of whom were tried by court martial and sentenced\r\nto be hanged. Of this number thirty-eight were executed at Mankato,\r\nDec. 26, 1862, President Lincoln having pardoned the remainder. Col.\r\nSibley was commissioned brigadier general for his gallant services,\r\nand retained in command of the frontier. In 1863 he led another\r\nexpedition into the Indian country, driving the hostiles across the\r\nMissouri river, and returning to Fort Snelling in September. The years\r\n1864 and 1865 were employed in securing the defense of the frontier.\r\nNov. 29, 1865, Gen. Sibley was commissioned major general for\r\nefficient and meritorious services. He continued in the service until\r\nAugust, 1866, when he was relieved of his command and detailed as a\r\nmember of the commission to negotiate treaties with the hostile Sioux\r\nand other bands on the Upper Missouri river.\r\n\r\nIn 1871 Gen. Sibley was elected to represent the Fifth ward, St. Paul,\r\nin the legislature. He became a resident of St. Paul in 1862, but, in\r\ncompany with Louis Robert and A. L. Larpenteur, had entered land for\r\nthe town site there as early as 1854.\r\n\r\nGen. Sibley has been for several years president of the Gas Company,\r\ndirector of the First National Bank, director of the Sioux City\r\nrailway, etc. He has at different times filled other responsible\r\npositions; has been park commissioner, president of the Historical\r\nSociety, president of the Chamber of Commerce, and was once the\r\ncandidate of his party for Congress, but unsuccessful. He has\r\ncontributed many valuable papers to the State Historical Society and\r\nhas written much on topics relating to the welfare of the State, of\r\nwhich, with the exception of his personal friend, W. T. Boutwell, he\r\nis now the oldest resident.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Alex. Ramsey]\r\n\r\nGen. Sibley, for his integrity, persistent devotion to the welfare of\r\nthe State, for his indomitable persistence in upbuilding its\r\ninterests, has won a lasting place in the confidence and respect of\r\nthe people. His history is inseparably interwoven with the history of\r\nthe State, and he is justly regarded as one of its first and best\r\ncitizens. The town and county of Sibley bear his name.\r\n\r\nHe was married May 2, 1843, to Sarah J., sister of Frank Steele. Mrs.\r\nSibley died May 21, 1869, much respected for her many virtues and rare\r\naccomplishments.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER RAMSEY, the first territorial governor of Minnesota, was\r\nborn in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Sept. 8, 1815. His paternal\r\nancestors were Scotch-Irish. His mother was of German descent. His\r\nparents were Thomas and Elisabeth (Kelker) Ramsey. His father was an\r\nofficer in the war of 1812, and died when the son was but ten years\r\nold. Frederic Kelker, an uncle, assisted in the education of the son,\r\nwho in turn assisted as salesman in the store of his uncle. At the age\r\nof eighteen he entered Lafayette College; at Easton, Pennsylvania;\r\nattended college but a short time, when he commenced the study of law\r\nwith Hon. Hamilton Alricks, of Harrisburg, graduating afterward in the\r\nlaw school at Carlisle, and commenced the practice of law in 1839. He\r\ncommenced his political life in 1840, the year of the Harrison\r\ncampaign, and was made secretary of the electoral college. In 1841 he\r\nwas appointed clerk of the Pennsylvania house of representatives. He\r\nwas in the lower house of Congress from 1843 to 1846, and was\r\nrenominated for a third term, but declined. In 1848 he was made\r\nchairman of the Whig state central committee, and the following year\r\nwas appointed governor of the newly formed territory of Minnesota by\r\nPresident Taylor. He entered upon his duties as governor in May, 1849.\r\nThe territorial government was organized in June, and the governor\r\nissued his proclamation establishing three judicial districts, and\r\nproviding for the election of members of the first legislature. He\r\nserved as governor four years. In 1855 he was elected mayor of St.\r\nPaul. In 1857 he was candidate for governor of the State, but was not\r\nelected. He was elected to that office in 1859, and re-elected in\r\n1861. In 1863, before the expiration of his second term, he was\r\nelected to the United States senate, and re-elected in 1869. March 4,\r\n1875, he accepted the position of secretary of war in the cabinet of\r\nPresident Hayes, and for a time was acting secretary of the navy. In\r\n1883 he was appointed chairman of the Utah commission under the\r\nEdmunds bill.\r\n\r\nIn the various departments of public service to which he has been\r\ncalled, Gov. Ramsey has acquitted himself well, displaying rare\r\nqualities of statesmanship. He is remarkable for his caution, which\r\nleads him sometimes almost into conservatism, but results have\r\ngenerally proved the sagacity of his apparently tardy movements. He is\r\na master in the exercise of a wise caution in the conduct of public\r\naffairs. He has, in fact, great political sagacity. He has made\r\nseveral favorable treaties with the Indians, being empowered during\r\nhis term as governor to act also as superintendent of Indian affairs.\r\n\r\nDuring his two terms as state governor, he rendered the country great\r\nservice by his prompt response to the calls for volunteers and his\r\ndecisive and unwavering support of the general government. He also\r\nacted with great promptness and resolution in the suppression of the\r\nIndian outbreak. As a senator he supported all measures for the\r\nprosecution of the war for the preservation of the Union; advocated\r\nthe abolition of the franking privilege and assisted in procuring aid\r\nfor the building of the Northern Pacific railroad, favoring the\r\nproject of three trunk lines between the Mississippi and the Pacific\r\nStates and the general plan of aiding these roads by the donation of\r\nalternate sections of public land, and was also active in promoting\r\nthe improvement of the Upper Mississippi and navigable tributaries.\r\n\r\nIn person Gov. Ramsey is a hale, hearty, and well preserved gentleman,\r\nwho is passing gracefully into what with many is the season of the\r\nsere and yellow leaf. He is genial and pleasant in his manners, and\r\nwould impress the ordinary observer as one whose \"lines have fallen in\r\npleasant places,\" and who is the happy possessor of a good digestion,\r\na serene temper and a clear conscience.\r\n\r\nOn Sept. 10, 1845, he was married to Anna Earl Jenks, daughter of Hon.\r\nMichael H. Jenks, for many years judge of Bucks county, Pennsylvania,\r\na lady of rare accomplishments, and in every way fitted to shine in\r\nthe society into which she was introduced as the wife of a governor,\r\nsenator and cabinet officer. In private life she was not less noted\r\nfor her kindness of heart, amiability and christian virtues. This\r\nestimable lady died in 1883, leaving a daughter, Marion, the wife of\r\nCharles Elliott Furness, of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nMAJ. WM. H. FORBES was born on Montreal island, Canada, Nov. 3, 1815.\r\nHis father was a Scotchman by birth, and was a member of the Hudson\r\nBay Company as early as 1785. Maj. Forbes was educated at Montreal,\r\nwhere he also served an apprenticeship at the hardware business, and\r\nafterward became junior partner in the same establishment. At that\r\ntime Montreal was the chief depot of supplies for the Indian trade of\r\nthe Northwest, and the reports which continually came to him of that\r\nromantic region, together with the sight of the Indians and voyageurs\r\nreturning with their furs, so excited his love of adventure that he\r\nresigned his position as partner in the hardware business and accepted\r\na clerkship with the American Fur Company. John Jacob Astor was then\r\npresident. The conditions were that the clerk should speak and write\r\nthe French language, which Mr. Forbes could do with facility. Having\r\nengaged as clerk, his outfit was conveyed in bark canoes from\r\nMontreal, in charge of fifty men enlisted for a three years' cruise.\r\nTheir route lay by way of the lakes to La Pointe, on Lake Superior,\r\nand up the Brule river, from which the canoes and baggage were carried\r\nacross to the waters of the St. Croix, and descended thence to the\r\nMississippi. From the Sault Ste. Marie to La Pointe they were\r\ntransported on one of the company's schooners. They arrived at Mendota\r\nin 1837. Gen. Sibley was then in charge at Mendota. Mr. Forbes clerked\r\nfor him ten years, and in 1847 took charge of an establishment\r\nbelonging to the company (called the St. Paul Outfit), and became a\r\nresident of St. Paul until his death, twenty-eight years later. Mr.\r\nForbes was a member from St. Paul of the first territorial council,\r\nand served four terms. In March, 1853, he was appointed postmaster at\r\nSt. Paul by President Pierce, and held the office three years. In 1853\r\nhe also formed a business partnership with Norman W. Kittson for the\r\ngeneral supplying of the Indian trade. In 1858 Mr. Kittson retired\r\nfrom the firm, but the business was continued by Maj. Forbes until\r\n1862, when the Indian outbreak put an end to the trade. During the\r\ncampaign he served as a member of Gen. Sibley's staff, and acted as\r\nprovost marshal at the trial of the three hundred Indians condemned to\r\ndeath. At the close of this campaign he was commissioned by President\r\nLincoln commissary of subsistence in the volunteer service with the\r\nrank of captain. He was elected auditor of Ramsey county in 1863, and\r\nserved two years, though sometimes absent on military duty. In 1864 he\r\nwas ordered to the district of Northern Missouri as chief commissary,\r\nremained two years and was breveted major. In 1871 he was appointed\r\nIndian agent at Devil's Lake reservation, which position he held at\r\nthe time of his death, July 20, 1875.\r\n\r\nMaj. Forbes was twice married; first in 1846, to Miss Agnes, daughter\r\nof Alexander Faribault, by whom he had one daughter, the wife of Capt.\r\nJ. H. Patterson, United States Army; again in 1854, to Miss A. B.\r\nCory, of Cooperstown, New York, by whom he had four children, three of\r\nwhom are living.\r\n\r\nHENRY M. RICE.--The family of Mr. Rice came originally from\r\nHertfordshire, England, to Sudbury, Massachusetts, in 1638. Members of\r\nthe family figured conspicuously in the struggle for American\r\nindependence. His parents were Edmund and Ellen Durkee Rice. His\r\ngrandfather Durkee was in the French war of 1755. Mr. Rice was born in\r\nWaitsfield, Vermont, Nov. 29, 1816; attended common school three\r\nmonths in the year and a private school and academy in Burlington. He\r\nwent to Detroit, Michigan Territory, in 1835; was engaged in making\r\nthe first survey of the Sault Ste. Marie canal, made by the state of\r\nMichigan in 1837, and went to Fort Snelling in 1839. He was post\r\nsutler in 1840, United States Army, Fort Atkinson, Iowa Territory, and\r\nwas connected with the old fur company for several years. He was\r\nelected delegate to Congress in 1853 for Minnesota Territory and\r\nre-elected in 1855. He was elected first United States senator for\r\nMinnesota, in 1857, admitted to his seat May 11, 1858, and served\r\nuntil March 3, 1863. In 1860 he was a member of the senate special\r\ncommittee of thirteen on the condition of the country. During his term\r\nin the senate he was a member of the following standing committees:\r\nIndian affairs, post office and post roads, public lands, military,\r\nfinance. He was on the last four named committees at the expiration of\r\nthe term of March 3, 1863.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Henry M. Rice]\r\n\r\nIn 1865 he was nominated for governor but was defeated by Gen. W. R.\r\nMarshall. In 1866 he was delegate to the Philadelphia Union\r\nconvention. He also served in the following various capacities: United\r\nStates commissioner in making several Indian treaties; as a member of\r\nthe board of regents of the University of Minnesota; as president of\r\nthe Minnesota State Historical Society; as president of the St. Paul\r\nBoard of Public Works; and as treasurer of Ramsey county, Minnesota.\r\nHe is the author of the law extending the right of pre-emption over\r\nunsurveyed lands in Minnesota. He has obtained land grants for\r\nnumerous railroads in Minnesota, and, with the assistance of Senator\r\nDouglas, framed the act authorizing Minnesota to form a state\r\nconstitution preparatory to admission, fixing boundary, etc.\r\n\r\nAs a public man Mr. Rice has pursued a policy at once independent and\r\noutspoken, not hesitating to express his convictions on the great\r\nnational questions of the day, and to place himself upon a national\r\nrather than a party platform. During the war he upheld the\r\nadministration in a vigorous prosecution of the war, as the speediest\r\nand most honorable means of obtaining peace. His letter to the St.\r\nPaul _Press_ of Nov. 1, 1864, contains sentiments that must commend\r\nthemselves to every true lover of his country. We quote a few\r\nextracts:\r\n\r\n\"I believe Gen. McClellan and Mr. Lincoln both desire peace--both the\r\nrestoration of the Union. The one favors the return of the Southern\r\nStates with slavery; the other wishes these states to return without\r\nthat institution. I believe that the revolted citizens forfeited all\r\nrights they had under the constitution when they turned traitors; that\r\nthe Emancipation Proclamation legally and rightfully set every slave\r\nfree. I am as much opposed to again legalizing that institution in the\r\nSouth as I would be to its introduction in the Northern States.\"\r\n\r\n* * * \"I am in favor of the return of the Southern States, and think\r\nthe day is not far distant when the same flag will float over us all,\r\nand when that happy day shall arrive, I hope that the rights we enjoy\r\nwill be freely accorded to them, and no more.\"\r\n\r\n* * * \"When the Southern States return I shall be in favor of their\r\nvoting population being equally represented with our own, and no\r\nfurther.\"\r\n\r\n* * * \"I think that in the long future, when all other of Mr.\r\nLincoln's acts shall be forgotten, his Emancipation Proclamation will\r\nadorn history's brightest page. I am opposed to slavery for the reason\r\nthat _I am in favor of the largest human liberty_, and I can not\r\nunderstand why some of our fellow citizens who come here that they\r\nmight be free can deny freedom to others.\"\r\n\r\n* * * \"I think it illy becomes those who took up arms to defend their\r\nhomes, their country, yea, liberty! to make overtures to armed\r\nrebellion. I believe that by a rigorous prosecution of the war peace\r\nwill soon come, our liberties will be secured forever, and that\r\nprosperity will follow. Union with slavery will be only a temporary\r\ncheat, and can not last. Dissolution will bring ruin, anarchy and an\r\nendless effusion of blood and money.\"\r\n\r\nHe has been a liberal contributor to the various public enterprises of\r\nthe city, to churches, public institutions and private parties. He has\r\nbuilt warehouses, business blocks and hotels. The park in front of the\r\ncity hall was donated by him. His name is inseparably interwoven with\r\nthe history of St. Paul and the State. Rice county bears his name. He\r\nwas married to Matilda Whitall, of Richmond, Virginia, in 1849.\r\n\r\nEDMUND RICE, brother of Hon. Henry M. Rice, was born in Waitsfield,\r\nVermont, Feb. 14, 1819. His father died in 1829. He received a\r\nsomewhat limited common school education and spent most of his early\r\nlife clerking. In 1838 he came to Kalamazoo, Michigan, where he read\r\nlaw with Stuart & Miller, and was admitted to the bar in 1842, making\r\ncommendable progress in his profession. While a resident of Michigan\r\nhe was master in chancery, register of court of chancery and clerk of\r\nthe supreme court. In 1847 he enlisted in Company A, First Michigan\r\nVolunteers, of which company he was made first lieutenant, and served\r\nthrough the Mexican War until its close.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1849, he came to Minnesota Territory, locating in St. Paul,\r\nwhere he became one of the firm of Rice, Hollinshead & Becker until\r\n1855, when he embarked in railroad enterprises. In 1857 he was elected\r\npresident of the Minnesota & Pacific Railroad Company, and afterward\r\nof its successors, the St. Paul & Pacific and the St. Paul & Chicago\r\nRailroad companies. He has been long regarded as one of the most\r\nenergetic and competent railroad men in the State. Mr. Rice has\r\nfigured largely in the politics of the State, having served several\r\nterms in the territorial and state legislatures. He was a\r\nrepresentative in the territorial legislature of 1851, a senator in\r\nthe state legislatures of 1864, 1865, 1873, 1874, and a representative\r\nin the sessions of 1872, 1877 and 1878.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Edmund Rice]\r\n\r\nIn 1885 he was elected mayor of St. Paul, and in 1886 was chosen\r\nrepresentative in Congress. Mr. Rice is an uncompromising Democrat in\r\nhis politics, and is so recognized by his party, which he served as\r\nchairman of the state central committee in the presidential campaign\r\nof 1872, and elector at large in the campaign of 1876. He was married\r\nin November, 1848, to Anna M. Acker, daughter of Hon. Henry Acker, of\r\nKalamazoo, Michigan. Of eleven children, the fruit of this union, all\r\nare living but the second daughter, Jessie, who married Frank H.\r\nClark, of Philadelphia, in 1870, and died in October, 1874. The eldest\r\ndaughter, Ellen, is the wife of Henry A. Boardman, of St. Paul.\r\n\r\nLOUIS ROBERT.--Capt. Louis Robert was a descendant of the French\r\nsettlers who occupied Kaskaskia and St. Louis when they were in the\r\nterritory of Louisiana, then a French province. He was born at\r\nCarondelet, Missouri, Jan. 21, 1811, and his early life was spent in\r\nthat region and on the Upper Missouri river. In 1838 he went to\r\nPrairie du Chien, and in the fall of 1843 visited St. Paul and removed\r\nthither the ensuing year, identifying himself with the interests of\r\nthat growing young city.\r\n\r\nTo say the least, he was a remarkable character. He possessed all the\r\npoliteness and suavity of his nationality, was impulsive, warm\r\nhearted, generous and yet, as a business man, far-seeing and\r\nloquacious. His broken English added a peculiar charm and quaintness\r\nto his conversation, and he will be long remembered for his odd\r\nexpressions and his keen but homely wit. He was generous in aiding any\r\nworthy object, and, as a devoted Catholic, gave liberally to the\r\nsupport of his church. He donated valuable property to church building\r\nand gave the bells to the French Catholic church and the cathedral in\r\nSt. Paul. His private charities were also liberal.\r\n\r\nIn 1847 Capt. Robert was one of the original proprietors of St. Paul.\r\nHe took a prominent part in the Stillwater convention of 1848. In 1849\r\nhe was appointed commissioner on territorial buildings. In 1853 he\r\nengaged in steamboating, and at different times owned as many as five\r\nsteamers. He was also largely engaged in the Indian trade until the\r\nmassacre of 1862. He died, after a painful illness, May 10, 1874,\r\nleaving an estate valued at $400,000. He was married in 1839, at\r\nPrairie du Chien, to Mary Turpin, who, with two daughters, survives\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAUGUSTE LOUIS LARPENTEUR, the son of Louis Auguste, and Malinda\r\n(Simmons) Larpenteur, was born in Baltimore, Maryland, May 16, 1823.\r\nHis grandfather, Louis Benoist Larpenteur, left France about the time\r\nof the banishment of Napoleon Bonaparte to St. Helena, determined not\r\nto live under the rule of the Bourbons. Auguste L., the grandson, was\r\nreared in the family of his grandfather, his mother having died while\r\nhe was an infant. At the age of eighteen years, with his uncle, Eugene\r\nN. Larpenteur, he came to St. Louis. Two years later he came to St.\r\nPaul as clerk for Wm. Hartshorn and Henry Jackson, Indian traders. The\r\nfirm of Hartshorn & Jackson gave place to Freeman, Larpenteur & Co.\r\nMr. Larpenteur has been continuously engaged in commercial pursuits\r\nsince his arrival in St. Paul in 1843. He has seen the city grow from\r\na hamlet of five cabins to its present metropolitan dimensions, and\r\nhas been from the first one of its most enterprising and reliable\r\ncitizens.

In 1848 he\r\nremoved from Stillwater to St. Paul, and opened the first\r\nblacksmithing and wagon shop in that city. He made the first wagon in\r\nthe Territory. He was a member of the house, fifth territorial\r\nlegislature, in 1855, from Ramsey county. In 1853 he made an overland\r\ntrip to California, and discovered one of the best passes in the\r\nmountains. 1857 he returned and surveyed a government wagon road\r\nthrough that pass. As a recognition of his services the pass received\r\nthe name of \"Noble's Pass,\" and a county in Minnesota was also named\r\nafter him. In 1857 he laid out a government road from St. Paul to the\r\nMissouri river. In 1862 he entered the army and was appointed\r\nlieutenant colonel of the Seventy-ninth New York Volunteers, better\r\nknown as the \"Highlanders.\" While on duty in South Carolina, a\r\npersonal collision with another officer led to his resignation. He was\r\nafterward cotton collector for the government, United States revenue\r\nofficer, and master of transportation at Mobile. His health failing\r\nduring his arduous service, he returned to St. Paul, and died at St.\r\nLuke's Hospital, on Eighth street, aged sixty years.\r\n\r\nCol.

At that time it was the largest building in the city,\r\nand many of the old residents remember the ceremonies attendant upon\r\nthe raising of the frame. The dramatic hall was in one of the upper\r\nstories, being known as Mazourka Hall. The materials used in its\r\nconstruction were brought from long distances, coming up the river by\r\nboat, and the laborers employed on the building were paid five dollars\r\na day for their services. Into this building the Elfelt brothers\r\ntransferred their store, stocking it at first with both dry goods and\r\ngroceries, but afterward limiting their trade to dry goods\r\nexclusively.\r\n\r\nMr. Abram Elfelt originated the first Board of Trade, in 1864, and\r\nwhen that body was merged into the Chamber of Commerce became one of\r\nits directors.

He commenced as a clerk in a\r\nstore in Providence, Rhode Island, and by faithfulness and industry\r\nbecame in time a wholesale dry goods merchant. His health failing, he\r\nsought the West in 1849, and selected for his home a high bluff, to\r\nwhich his name has been affixed, near the city of St. Paul. He\r\npurchased over 5,000 acres of land in the vicinity. The bluff is now\r\ncovered with palatial residences, business, church and school\r\nbuildings.\r\n\r\nMr. Dayton lived much of his time at a village founded by himself at\r\nthe junction of Crow river with the Mississippi.

He enjoyed good educational advantages, first in the\r\ncommon schools and later had as a tutor Rev. Brooks, a Methodist\r\nclergyman, an accomplished gentleman and scholar, who gave him\r\nthorough instruction in the sciences and classics. In 1839 he entered\r\nPenn College, where he became a ready writer and pleasant speaker.\r\nAfter leaving college he studied law with his brother, Senator Cooper,\r\nand in 1845 was admitted to practice. He practiced in several\r\ncounties, showed rare ability, espoused with enthusiasm the politics\r\nof the Whig party, and on the accession of Gen. Taylor to the\r\npresidency, in 1849, was appointed by him first assistant judge of the\r\nsupreme court for the territory of Minnesota. He arrived in Minnesota\r\nin June, 1849, and located in Stillwater; was assigned by Gov. Ramsey\r\nto the Second Judicial district, and held his first court at Mendota.\r\nHe changed his residence to St. Paul in 1853, and, leaving the bench,\r\ndevoted himself to law practice in St. Paul. He was a Republican\r\ncandidate for Congress in 1858, at the first session of the state\r\nlegislature.\r\n\r\nHe left Minnesota for Nevada in 1864, then went to Salt Lake City,\r\nwhere he died in a hospital in 1875.

He was\r\neducated at the St. Louis University, and studied law in Quincy,\r\nIllinois, being admitted to practice in 1847. A year later he\r\naccompanied Gen. Samuel Leech to St. Croix Falls, and was clerk during\r\nthe first land sales in that region, while Gen. Leech was receiver.\r\nThe same year he came to St. Paul, settling down to the legal\r\nprofession. He was a Democrat in politics, and held the office of\r\nchief clerk of the house in the legislature of 1851, being elected in\r\n1853 and re-elected in 1856 as a representative. In 1853 he was beaten\r\nfor the speakership by Dr. David Day, after balloting for twenty-two\r\ndays. About ten years after this he became president of the town\r\ncouncil for two years, and was city clerk for a year and a half.\r\nPresident Lincoln appointed him consul to Tehuantepec, Mexico, in\r\n1862, where he served until 1865.

DAVIDSON, better known as \"Commodore\" Davidson, was born in\r\nLawrence county, Ohio, Feb. 14, 1825. He was early associated with his\r\nfather in canal boating and river life and acquired a strong\r\npredilection for the pursuit in which he afterward became\r\ndistinguished. His father was a Baptist preacher, and the influence of\r\nhis teachings was apparent in many acts of the son's later life. His\r\nadvantages for education were limited, as his chief training was on\r\nboard the boats on which he was employed. In 1854 he came to St. Paul.\r\nBefore coming West he was interested in boating on the Ohio river, and\r\nwas the owner of several steamers. His first work in Minnesota was on\r\nthe Minnesota river, but soon afterward he became president of a\r\ncompany known as the La Crosse & Minnesota Packet Company. His\r\nexperience and superior ability placed him at the head of river\r\nnavigation, and for many years he had scarce a rival, earning by this\r\nsupremacy the familiar cognomen of \"Commodore,\" first applied to him,\r\nwe believe, by John Fletcher Williams.\r\n\r\nDuring ten years of his river life he resided in St. Louis. With the\r\nincrease of railroads and the brisk competition of later days, he\r\ngradually withdrew from the river trade and interested himself in real\r\nestate in St. Paul, buying largely and building many fine blocks.\r\n\r\nThough never an aspirant for office, Commodore Davidson was public\r\nspirited and interested greatly in public enterprises involving the\r\nprosperity of St. Paul. He was married in Ohio in 1856, to a daughter\r\nof Judge Benjamin Johnson. He died in St. Paul, May 26, 1887, leaving\r\na widow, one son and one daughter. Capt. Thomas L. Davidson is a\r\nbrother, and Jerry and Robert R. are half brothers. Col. J. Ham\r\nDavidson, a cousin and a man of considerable oratorical ability, was\r\nassociated with him in business.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WM. H. FISHER.]\r\n\r\nWILLIAM H.

He entered the\r\nrailway service of the Dubuque & Sioux City railroad as check clerk at\r\nDubuque, Iowa, in 1864, serving as such and in other positions of\r\nresponsibility until 1873, when he removed to St. Paul, Minnesota,\r\nentering the service of the St. Paul & Pacific railroad as\r\nsuperintendent. He built the Breckenridge extension in 1877, and was\r\ninfluential in relieving the St. Paul & Pacific railroad and branches\r\nfrom financial embarrassment, which resulted in the organization of\r\nthe present St. Paul, Minneapolis & Manitoba system. In June, 1884, he\r\nwas elected general superintendent, and in June, 1885, president and\r\ngeneral superintendent, of the St. Paul & Duluth Railroad Company,\r\nwhich position he at present worthily fills.\r\n\r\nCHARLES H.

In 1853 he entered the banking\r\nfirm of Borup & Oakes, the first banking firm in St. Paul, since which\r\ntime he has lived a quiet and retired life, that contrasts strongly\r\nwith the strange and adventurous life he led as an Indian trader. Mr.\r\nOakes' only public life was during the Indian outbreak, when he\r\naccepted a position as colonel on the staff of Gen. Sibley. He was a\r\nmember of the Protestant Episcopal church. By his first wife Mr. Oakes\r\nhad four children, two of them daughters, now living. Sophia is the\r\nwidow of the late Jeremiah Russell, and Eliza is the wife of Col.\r\nGeorge W. Sweet, of Minneapolis. A son, Lieut. David Oakes, was in the\r\nCivil War, and was killed in battle. The other child died in infancy.\r\n\r\nMr. Oakes was married to his second wife, Julia Beaulieu, of Sault\r\nSte. Marie, July 29, 1831.

In 1854 the\r\nbanking house of Borup & Oakes, of which he was senior partner, was\r\nestablished. Dr. Borup died of heart disease, July 6, 1859, but the\r\nbanking business was continued under the firm name many years later.\r\nHe was married July 17, 1832, to Elizabeth Beaulieu, a daughter of\r\nBasil Beaulieu, a French trader of Mackinaw. His widow died in St.\r\nPaul several years ago. Of a family of eleven children, nine survive.\r\n\r\nCAPT. RUSSELL BLAKELEY, one of the best known of the early steamboat\r\nmen, was born in North Adams, Massachusetts, April 19, 1815.

His paternal great-grandfather came from Ireland in 1764.\r\nHis grandfather was born in Ireland, but came to this country in his\r\nchildhood. His father, Samuel Nelson, was associate justice of the\r\nUnited States supreme court. His father served as a soldier in the war\r\nof 1812, and the son located the land warrant given for his services\r\nin Minnesota. The mother of Rensselaer was Catharine Ann (Russell), a\r\ndescendant of Rev.

SANBORN was born Dec. 5, 1826, in Merrimac county, New\r\nHampshire, on the farm which had been in the possession of his\r\nancestors for four generations. After a common school education he\r\nentered the law office of Judge Fowler, of Concord, New Hampshire,\r\nwhere he remained for three years, when he was admitted to practice by\r\nthe superior court of New Hampshire, in 1854. In the following\r\nDecember he came to Minnesota, where he has remained, a citizen of St.\r\nPaul, and in the practice of his profession, except what time he has\r\nbeen absent in the public service.\r\n\r\nHis public career began in 1859-60, in the house of representatives.\r\nThe following year he was sent to the senate, and that had adjourned\r\nbut a little over a month when he was appointed adjutant general and\r\nacting quartermaster general of the State, and entered upon the\r\narduous duties of organizing the first regiment of volunteers in the\r\nState for the war of the Rebellion.\r\n\r\nIn the following December he was commissioned colonel of the Fourth\r\nMinnesota, and, with headquarters at Fort Snelling, garrisoned all the\r\nposts and commanded all the troops along the Minnesota frontier during\r\nthe winter. Early in the spring of 1862 he left with his entire\r\ncommand for Pittsburgh Landing, and was assigned to the command of a\r\ndemi-brigade, which he commanded till the evacuation of those works,\r\nand was thereupon assigned to the command of the First Brigade,\r\nSeventh Division, Army of the Mississippi, afterward the Seventeenth\r\nArmy Corps.\r\n\r\nOn the nineteenth of September following, with this brigade he fought\r\nthe battle of Iuka and won the victory for which he was promoted by\r\nthe president to brigadier general of Volunteers.\r\n\r\nHe participated in the battles of Port Gibson, Raymond, Jackson,\r\nChampion Hills, and the assault on Vicksburg--a portion of which time\r\nhe was in command of a division. After the surrender of Vicksburg he\r\nwas assigned to the command of the Southwest District of Missouri,\r\nwhere, after the campaign against Price, he was promoted to brevet\r\nmajor general.\r\n\r\nAfter the close of the war, by a few months' campaign on the Upper\r\nArkansas and along the Smoky Hill river, he opened to travel the long\r\nlines across the plains to Colorado and New Mexico, which had been\r\nclosed for nearly two years, and restored peace to that frontier. Upon\r\na mission to the Indian Territory, to establish the relations which\r\nshould exist between the slaves of the Indians and their former\r\nmasters, he solved the questions and determined the relations, and\r\nestablished them upon a firm foundation in the short space of ninety\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nIn 1866 he was appointed, with Gens. Sherman, Harney, Terry, and\r\nSenator Henderson, a special peace commissioner to the Indians, and\r\nfor eighteen months served upon that board. This commission visited\r\nand made treaties with the Camanche, Cheyenne, Arrapahoe, Apache,\r\nNavajo, Shoshone, Northern Cheyenne, Northern Arrapahoe, and Crow\r\ntribes; and with the Ogalalla, Brule, Minneconjon, Sausauche, Black\r\nFeet, Umkapapa, Santee, and Yankton bands of the Sioux nation. They\r\nsettled upon and recommended to Congress a fixed policy to be pursued\r\ntoward the Indians, which, while followed, resulted in comparative\r\nsafety to the frontier, and greater economy in the service. Since\r\nthese services the general has devoted himself entirely to his\r\nprofession, and with more than ordinary success.\r\n\r\nJOHN R. IRVINE was born in Dansville, Livingston county, New York,\r\nNov. 3, 1812, and was brought up there till seventeen years of age.\r\nHis education when a boy was obtained at the common schools, and was\r\nquite limited.

Soon after his marriage he returned to Dansville. The\r\nfollowing spring he went to Buffalo, New York; in the spring of 1837\r\nemigrated to Green Bay, Wisconsin, and in the spring of 1840 removed\r\nto Prairie du Chien.\r\n\r\nWhile in Prairie du Chien Mr. Irvine kept a grocery. During that time\r\nhe made two trips to St. Paul--the last one with a team loaded with\r\nprovisions, on the ice the most of the way--and on the third of\r\nAugust, 1843, arrived in St. Paul with his family. On his arrival he\r\nbought of Joseph Rondeau a claim of 240 acres of land, afterward\r\nconverted into Rice & Irvine's addition, Irvine's enlargement and\r\nIrvine's addition to the city of St. Paul, including most of the\r\npresent city from St. Peter street to Leech's addition, for about\r\n$300. Mr. Irvine entered it in 1848. The east 80 acres of a quarter\r\nincluded in this claim Mr. Irvine sold to Henry M. Rice in 1848, and\r\nin the winter they laid off Rice & Irvine's addition, and commenced\r\nselling lots and making improvements on the property.\r\n\r\nSince living in St. Paul Mr. Irvine has been engaged in farming,\r\nmilling, storekeeping, working at his trade, and managing his estate.\r\nHe was one of the earliest settlers of St. Paul, whose life amidst its\r\nmany changes has been contemporaneous with its history from the very\r\nbeginning. Mr. Irvine has had eight children, seven of whom, namely,\r\nsix daughters and one son, are living. Mr. Irvine died in 1878.\r\n\r\nHORACE RANSOM BIGELOW was born in Watervliet, New York, March 13,\r\n1820. His father, Otis Bigelow, was a Revolutionary patriot and\r\nsoldier.

His father,\r\nHoratio N. Davis, removed to Wisconsin in August or September of the\r\nsame year, and settled on the present site of Waukesha. His father was\r\nquite prominent; had served during the Civil War, and retired from the\r\nservice with the brevet rank of major; had held various municipal\r\noffices, and had been a member of the Wisconsin senate. Cushman, his\r\noldest son, received as good an education as the times afforded, at\r\nthe common schools, at Carroll College, a Waukesha institution, and at\r\nAnn Arbor, Michigan, where he graduated in 1857. He read law with Gov.\r\nRandall, was admitted to the bar in 1859, and practiced at Waukesha\r\nuntil 1862, when he enlisted in the Twenty-eighth Wisconsin Infantry,\r\ngoing in as first lieutenant of Company B, but was adjutant general\r\nunder Gen.

His lecture\r\non \"Feudalism\" was delivered in 1870, and this lecture probably\r\nsecured him the nomination for governor in 1873. He has also lectured\r\non \"Hamlet\" and \"Madam Roland,\" and in 1884 delivered a lecture before\r\nthe Army of the Tennessee and in 1886 a lecture to the graduating\r\nclass at Michigan University.

It was originally\r\nwell diversified with timber and prairie lands, and is well watered by\r\nthe tributaries of the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers. Vermillion\r\nriver, which flows through this county, has near its junction with the\r\nMississippi a picturesque waterfall, now somewhat marred by the\r\nerection of mills and manufactories.\r\n\r\n\r\nHASTINGS,\r\n\r\nLying near the mouth of the Vermillion river, is a wide-awake,\r\nthriving city, beautifully located on the banks of the Mississippi. It\r\nhas a fine court house, good hotels, manufactories and business\r\nblocks. The Hastings & Dakota railroad has its eastern terminus here.\r\nThe St. Paul & Milwaukee, Burlington & Northern railroads pass through\r\nthe city. The river is bridged at this place.\r\n\r\n\r\nFARMINGTON,\r\n\r\nNear the centre of the county, on the Chicago, St. Paul & Minneapolis\r\nrailroad, is a thriving business village. West St. Paul has encroached\r\nlargely upon the north part of the county.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIOGRAPHICAL.\r\n\r\nIGNATIUS DONNELLY.--The parents of Ignatius Donnelly came from the\r\nGreen Isle in 1817, settling in Philadelphia, where Ignatius was born,\r\nNov. 3, 1831.

A\r\ncaptivating and fluent speaker, and besides a man of far more than\r\nordinary native ability and acquirements, he was not suffered to\r\nremain on his Dakota farm. In 1859 he was elected lieutenant governor\r\nof the newly admitted state, and was re-elected in 1861, serving four\r\nyears. He served his district in the thirty-seventh, thirty-eighth and\r\nthirty-ninth congresses. During his congressional term he advocated\r\nmany important measures, taking an advanced position in regard to\r\npopular education, and the cultivation and preservation of timber on\r\nthe public lands. For his advocacy of the last named measure he was\r\nmuch ridiculed at the time, but has lived to see his views generally\r\nunderstood, and his measures to a great extent adopted in many of the\r\nWestern States. He advocated amending the law relating to railroad\r\nland grants, so as to require their sale, within a reasonable period,\r\nat low prices.\r\n\r\nWhen he entered Congress, he gave up his law practice, and since his\r\nlast term he has devoted himself chiefly to farming, journalism and\r\ngeneral literature. In July, 1874, he became editor and proprietor of\r\nthe _Anti-Monopolist_, which he conducted several years. Within the\r\nlast decade he has published several works that have given him both\r\nnational and transatlantic fame. His works on the fabled \"Atlantis\"\r\nand \"Ragnarok\" prove him to be not only a thinker and scientist, but a\r\nwriter, the charms of whose style are equal to the profundity of his\r\nthought. His last work on the authorship of the Shakespearean plays\r\nhas attracted universal attention, not only for the boldness of his\r\nspeculations, but for the consummate ingenuity he has shown in\r\ndetecting the alleged cipher by which he assumes to prove Lord Bacon\r\nto be the author of the plays in question. The book has excited much\r\ncontroversy, and, as was to be expected, much adverse criticism. Mr.\r\nDonnelly was married in Philadelphia, Sept. 10, 1855, to Miss\r\nCatherine McCaffrey of that city. They have three children living.\r\n\r\nFRANCIS M. CROSBY.--The ancestors of Mr. Crosby were of Revolutionary\r\nfame. He was born in Wilmington, Windham county, Vermont, Nov. 13,\r\n1830. He received a common and high school education and spent one\r\nyear at Mount Cæsar Seminary, at Swansea, New Hampshire. He studied\r\nlaw and was admitted to practice at Bennington, Vermont, in 1855. He\r\nserved in the Vermont house of representatives in 1855-56. He\r\ncontinued the practice of law until 1858, when he came to Hastings and\r\nengaged in the practice of law. He served as judge of probate court in\r\n1860-61, acted as school commissioner several years in Dakota county,\r\nand was elected, in 1871, judge of the First Judicial district\r\ncomprising the counties of Goodhue, Dakota, Washington, Chisago, Pine,\r\nand Kanabec. He held the first courts in Pine and Kanabec counties.\r\nJudge Crosby is held in high esteem, not only by the bar, but by the\r\npeople at large. He is gentlemanly in his manners, yet prompt and\r\ndecisive in action.\r\n\r\nHe was married to Helen A. Sprague, in New York, May 13, 1866. Mrs.\r\nCrosby died in 1869. He married a second wife, Helen M. Bates, in New\r\nYork, in 1872. They have two sons and three daughters.\r\n\r\nHON. G. W. LE DUC was born at Wilkesville, Gallia county, Ohio, March\r\n29, 1823. His father, Henry Savary Duc, was the son of Henri Duc, an\r\nofficer of the French Army, who came over with D'Estaing to assist the\r\ncolonies in the Revolutionary struggle. The grandfather, after some\r\nstirring adventures in Guadaloupe, where he came near being murdered\r\nin a negro insurrection, escaped and came to Middletown, Connecticut,\r\nin 1796, where he was married to Lucy, daughter of Col. John Sumner,\r\nof Duryea's Brigade, Continental Troops, and a member of the Sumner\r\nfamily which came to Massachusetts in 1637. The father was married to\r\nMary Stewell, of Braintree, New York, in 1803. The family name,\r\noriginally written Duc, was changed to Le Duc in 1845. The grandfather\r\nremoved to Ohio and founded the town of Wilkesville. G. W. Le Duc, the\r\ngrandson, spent his early life at this place, but was educated at\r\nLancaster Academy, a school that numbered amongst its scholars Gen. W.\r\nT. and Senator John Sherman, the Ewing brothers, and others prominent\r\nin the history of the country. He entered Kenyon College in 1844,\r\ngraduated in 1848, and was employed for awhile by the firms of H. W.\r\nDerby & Co., of Cincinnati, and A. S. Barnes & Co., of New York.\r\nMeanwhile he studied law, and in 1850 was admitted to practice in the\r\nsupreme court of Ohio. July 5, 1850, he came to St. Paul and engaged\r\nin selling books, supplying the legislature and the government\r\nofficers at the Fort, but gradually turned his attention to practice\r\nin land office courts. At the breaking out of the Rebellion he\r\nenlisted, and was assigned to duty as captain A. Z. in the Army of the\r\nPotomac. During his term of service he was promoted to the grades of\r\nlieutenant colonel, colonel and brigadier general by brevet. Since the\r\nwar his most important official position has been that of commissioner\r\nof agriculture through the administration of President Hayes. In 1856\r\nhe removed to Hastings, and has ever since been identified with the\r\nprogress and prosperity of that city, and is the owner of large\r\nproperty interests there.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HON. G. W. LE DUC.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGOODHUE COUNTY.\r\n\r\nThis county lies on the west bank of the Mississippi river, between\r\nthe counties of Dakota and Wabasha. It derived its name from James M.\r\nGoodhue, pioneer editor and publisher in St. Paul. It is a rich and\r\npopulous county. The county seat is Red Wing, a thriving city of 7,000\r\ninhabitants, located on the banks of the Mississippi a short distance\r\nbelow the mouth of Cannon river, and at the outlet of several valleys\r\nforming a larger valley, well adapted to become the site of a city.\r\nThe hills surrounding the city are high, bold and many of them\r\nprecipitous. Mount La Grange, commonly known as Barn Bluff, a large\r\nisolated bluff, a half mile in length and three hundred and twenty\r\nfeet in height, stands between the lower part of the city and the\r\nriver. Part of the county lies upon the shore of Lake Pepin, and\r\nincludes the famous Point no Point, a bold promontory extending far\r\nout into the lake, with a curve so gradual that the eye of the person\r\nascending or descending the lake is unable to define the Point, which\r\nappears to recede before him as he approaches, till at last it\r\ndisappears, when looking backward he sees it in the part of the lake\r\nalready traversed. Cannon river, a considerable stream, passes through\r\nthe county from west to east.\r\n\r\nCannon Falls, on this river, once a picturesque and wild waterfall, is\r\nnow surrounded by the mills, manufactories and dwellings of a\r\nflourishing village, named after the falls. Goodhue county was\r\norganized under territorial law. In 1845 the principal point was Red\r\nWing. There we found a Swiss missionary named Galvin, an Indian farmer\r\nname Bush and the noted Jack Frazer, a half-breed trader, all living\r\nin log buildings. Mr. Galvin had a school of Indian children. Near by\r\nwas an Indian cemetery--burying ground it could not be called, as the\r\nbodies of the dead were elevated upon the branches of trees and upon\r\nstakes to be out of reach of animals. The bodies were wrapped in\r\nblankets and exposed until the flesh had decayed, when the bones were\r\ntaken and buried. Red Wing's band of Sioux Indians had their\r\nencampment here. It is said that Red Wing, the chief for whom the\r\nvillage and city was afterward named, chose for his burial place the\r\nsummit of Barn Bluff, and that when he died he was buried there,\r\nseated upon his horse, with his face turned to the Happy Hunting\r\nGround, the Indians heaping the earth around him till a huge mound was\r\nformed. The legend may need confirmation, but a mound is there to this\r\nday, on the highest part of the bluff, and the high spirited chief\r\ncould certainly have wished no nobler grave.\r\n\r\nRed Wing city bears few traces of its humble origin. It is a fine,\r\ncompactly built city, with handsome public and private buildings. It\r\nwas for some years the seat of Hamline University, now removed to St.\r\nPaul.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIOGRAPHICAL.\r\n\r\nHANS MATTSON.--Col. Mattson is a native of Onestad, Sweden. He was\r\nborn Dec. 23, 1832. His parents were Matts and Ilgena (Larson)\r\nMattson, both now residents of Vasa, Minnesota. The son was educated\r\nat a high classical school in Christianstad, and in his seventeenth\r\nyear entered the military service as a cadet and served one year.\r\nDisliking its monotony, and having an adventurous spirit he embarked\r\nfor America, where he found himself abjectly poor, and worked as a\r\ncabin boy on a coasting vessel, as a farm hand, and afterward with a\r\nshovel on an Illinois railroad until 1853, when he secured a position\r\nas an emigrant agent, whose business it was to select homes for\r\nSwedish colonists. He, with others, came to Vasa, Goodhue county,\r\nMinnesota, where he dealt in real estate, studying law meanwhile with\r\nWarren Bristol. He was admitted to the bar in 1858. He was elected\r\ncounty auditor the same year and served till 1860, when he entered the\r\narmy as captain of Company D, Third Minnesota Infantry. At the end of\r\nfour years he left the service with the rank of colonel. After his\r\nreturn from the war he formed a law partnership with C. C. Webster,\r\nand a year later he accepted the position of editor of a Swedish\r\nnewspaper in Chicago. In 1867 Gov. Marshall appointed him secretary of\r\nthe state board of immigration, which position he held several years,\r\ndoing the State excellent service. In 1869 he was elected secretary of\r\nstate, but before his term of office expired resigned to accept the\r\nappointment of land agent of railway corporations, which enabled him\r\nto spend four years abroad.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: L. F. Hubbard]\r\n\r\nCol. Mattson was for some time editor of the _Staats Tidning_, a\r\nSwedish paper in Minneapolis, and a large owner and general manager of\r\nthe _Swedish Tribune_ published in Chicago. He was a presidential\r\nelector in 1876. He was again elected secretary of state for 1887-88.\r\nHe is a versatile writer and a fluent speaker, a frank, outspoken and\r\nhonorable man. He was married Nov. 23, 1855, to Cherstin Peterson, a\r\nnative of Bullingslof, Sweden. They have five children living.\r\n\r\nLUCIUS FREDERICK HUBBARD was born Jan. 26, 1836, at Troy, New York. He\r\nwas the oldest son of Charles F. and Margaret (Van Valkenburg)\r\nHubbard, his father being a descendant of the Hubbard family that\r\nemigrated from the mother country and settled in New England in 1595;\r\nhis mother coming from the Holland Dutch stock that has occupied the\r\nvalley of the Hudson river since its earliest history.\r\n\r\nThe father dying early, the son found a home with an aunt at Chester,\r\nVermont, until he was twelve years old, when he was sent for three\r\nyears to the academy at Granville, New York. At the age of fifteen he\r\nwas apprenticed to a tinner at Poultney, Vermont, and completed his\r\ntrade at Salem, New York, in 1854, when he removed to Chicago for\r\nthree years. He then removed to Red Wing, Minnesota, and started the\r\nRed Wing _Republican_. In 1858 he was elected register of deeds of\r\nGoodhue county. In 1861 he sold out his interest in the _Republican_\r\nand ran for the state senate, but was defeated by the small majority\r\nof seven votes. In December, 1861, he enlisted in Company A, Fifth\r\nMinnesota Volunteers, and was elected captain. In March, 1862, he\r\nbecame lieutenant colonel; in August, colonel; and for conspicuous\r\ngallantry at the battle of Nashville was promoted to the position of\r\nbrigadier general. He participated in the battles of Farmington; of\r\nCorinth, where he was severely wounded; of Iuka, the second battle of\r\nCorinth; of Jackson and Mississippi Springs; in the siege of\r\nVicksburg; in the battle of Richmond, Louisiana; of Greenfield,\r\nLouisiana; of Nashville, where he was wounded and had two horses\r\nkilled under him, and at the siege of Spanish Fort. He was mustered\r\nout in October, 1865, at Mobile, Alabama. He was engaged in\r\ntwenty-four battles and minor engagements and won an enviable record\r\nfor his intrepidity and coolness. He returned to Red Wing with broken\r\nhealth, the result of fatigue and exposure.\r\n\r\nIn 1866 he engaged in the grain business at Red Wing, and soon\r\nthereafter in milling operations on a large scale in Wabasha county.\r\nIn 1872 he purchased an interest in the Forest mill, at Zumbrota,\r\nGoodhue county, and in 1875, with others, bought the mills and water\r\npower at Mazeppa, in Wabasha county, the mills soon after being\r\nrebuilt and enlarged.\r\n\r\nIn 1868 he raised, through his personal influence, the money necessary\r\nfor the completion of the Midland railway, a line extending from\r\nWabasha to Zumbrota.\r\n\r\nHe subsequently projected and organized the Minnesota Central railway\r\n(Cannon Valley), to run from Red Wing to Mankato. As president of the\r\ncompany he secured the building of the road from Red Wing to\r\nWaterville, about sixty-six miles.\r\n\r\nIn 1878 Gen. Hubbard was nominated for Congress in the Second district\r\nof Minnesota, but declined. In 1872 he was elected to the state\r\nsenate, and again in 1874, declining a re-election in 1876. In the\r\nsenate he was regarded as one of the best informed, painstaking and\r\ninfluential members. He was on the committee to investigate the state\r\ntreasurer's and state auditor's offices, and was largely instrumental\r\nin recommending and shaping legislation that brought about the\r\nsubstantial and much needed reform in the management of those offices.\r\nHe was also one of the three arbitrators selected to settle the\r\ndifficulties between the State and the prison contractors at\r\nStillwater. He was appointed commissioner, with John Nichols and Gen.\r\nTourtelotte, in 1866, to investigate the status of the state railroad\r\nbond, levied in 1858, and finally settled in 1881.\r\n\r\nOn Sept. 28, 1881, Gen. Hubbard was nominated for governor of\r\nMinnesota, and was elected by a majority of 27,857, the largest\r\nmajority ever received by any governor elected in the State. In 1883\r\nhe was renominated and re-elected by a very large majority.\r\n\r\nGov. Hubbard is an affable, genial, courteous gentleman, whose\r\nintegrity has never been questioned; a man of the people, and in\r\nsympathy with them and the best interests and general prosperity of\r\nthe State.\r\n\r\nGov. Hubbard was married in May, 1868, at Red Wing, to Amelia,\r\ndaughter of Charles Thomas, a merchant of that place. He has three\r\nchildren, two boys, aged seventeen and eleven respectively, and a\r\ngirl.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM COLVILLE is of Scotch descent on his father's side. The\r\nancient homestead of the family at Ochiltree is mentioned by Sir\r\nWalter Scott in his novel, \"The Antiquary.\" On his mother's side he is\r\nof Irish descent. His ancestors participated in the American\r\nRevolution. He was born in Chautauqua county, New York, April 5, 1830;\r\nwas educated at the Fredonia Academy, taught school one winter, read\r\nlaw in the office of Millard Fillmore and Solomon L. Haven, of\r\nBuffalo, and was admitted to the bar in 1851. He practiced law at\r\nForestville three years, and then removed to Red Wing, Minnesota. His\r\nfirst winter he spent in St. Paul as enrolling clerk of the\r\nterritorial council, and the winter following was secretary of the\r\ncouncil. In the spring of 1855 he established the Red Wing _Sentinel_,\r\na Democratic paper, and conducted it until the Civil War broke out. In\r\n1861 he entered the service as captain of Company F, First Minnesota\r\nInfantry, and served with that regiment three years, conducting\r\nhimself with such gallantry as to win promotion. He was wounded at the\r\nfirst battle of Bull Run, at Nelson's Farm and at Gettysburg, the last\r\nwounds received maiming him for life, and necessitating a close of his\r\nmilitary career. At the end of three years he left the service with\r\nthe rank of colonel, and edited the _Sentinel_ until January, 1865,\r\nwhen he took his seat as representative in the legislature. At its\r\nadjournment he was appointed colonel of the First Minnesota Heavy\r\nArtillery which was stationed at Chattanooga till the close of the\r\nwar. Col. Colville was mustered out of the service with the brevet\r\nrank of brigadier general. In the autumn of 1865 he was elected\r\nattorney general of the State on the Union ticket and served two\r\nyears. In 1866 he ran for Congress in opposition to the Republican\r\nnominee. In 1877 he was elected as a Democrat to the lower house of\r\nthe state legislature in the strongest Republican county in the State.\r\nThe same year he was appointed by President Cleveland register of the\r\nland office at Duluth, to which place he has removed his residence. He\r\nwas married to Miss Jane E. Morgan, of Oneida, New York, in 1867, a\r\ndescendant of Elder Brewster, who came over in the Mayflower.\r\n\r\nMARTIN S. CHANDLER, for twenty-two years sheriff of Goodhue county,\r\nMinnesota, was born in Jamestown, New York, Feb. 14, 1827. He came to\r\nGoodhue county in 1856 and engaged for awhile farming at Pine Island.\r\nHe was elected county commissioner in 1856, and served until 1858,\r\nremoving meanwhile to Red Wing, which has since been his home. In 1859\r\nhe was elected sheriff of Goodhue county, and held the office for\r\neleven consecutive terms, until 1882, when he was elected to the state\r\nsenate. He was presidential elector in 1872. He was appointed surveyor\r\ngeneral in 1883, which office he held until 1887. He was married to\r\nFannie F. Caldwell, of Jamestown, New York, in 1848. His only\r\ndaughter, Florence C., is the wife of Ira S. Kellogg, of Red Wing, one\r\nof the oldest druggists in the State.\r\n\r\nCHARLES MCCLURE was born in Virginia in 1810; was graduated at\r\nLewisburg, Virginia, in 1827; studied law and was admitted to practice\r\nin 1829. He came to Minnesota and located at Red Wing in 1856, where\r\nhe opened a law office. In 1857 he was a member of the constitutional\r\nconvention, presidential elector in 1861, state senator in 1862-63 and\r\nin 1864, judge of the First district, filling the vacancy caused by\r\nthe retirement of Judge McMillan. At the fall election of the same\r\nyear he was elected judge of the First district and served seven\r\nyears. This district embraced Washington, Chisago, Goodhue and Dakota\r\ncounties. Judge McClure is a man of unquestionable ability and\r\nintegrity.\r\n\r\nHORACE B. WILSON was born in Bingham; Somerset county, Maine, March\r\n30, 1821. His grandfather settled in Maine twenty years prior to the\r\nRevolution. He had a fair common school education until sixteen years\r\nold, when he attended the Maine Wesleyan Seminary, graduating four\r\nyears later. He devoted himself chiefly to teaching, and studied law\r\nmeanwhile, but never practiced. He taught in Cincinnati, Ohio,\r\nLawrenceburg and New Albany, Indiana, until 1850, when he was elected\r\ncity civil engineer, which position he filled six years. In 1858 he\r\nremoved to Red Wing, Minnesota, and taught, as professor of\r\nmathematics, natural science and civil engineering in Hamline\r\nUniversity four years. In 1862 he enlisted in Company F, Sixth\r\nMinnesota Infantry, was elected captain, and mustered out at the close\r\nof the war. His military service was quite arduous, including\r\ncampaigning against the Sioux until 1864, when the regiment was\r\nordered South and attached to the Sixteenth Army Corps.\r\n\r\nIn 1866 he was appointed superintendent of schools for Goodhue county.\r\nIn 1870 he was appointed state superintendent of schools, which\r\nposition he held five years. He was elected representative in the\r\nstate legislature in 1877, and subsequently he served four terms as\r\nsenator, and was president _pro tem._ of that body during the trial of\r\nE. St. Julien Cox, and in the absence of the lieutenant governor\r\npresided during the trial. For the past few years he has devoted\r\nhimself to civil engineering, and has had charge of the public\r\nimprovements of Red Wing. In 1844 he was married to Mary J. Chandler,\r\nwho died in 1887.\r\n\r\nAmong the prominent early settlers of Red Wing not mentioned in our\r\nbiographical notices were William Freeborn, for whom Freeborn county\r\nwas named, and who was a senator in the fifth, sixth, seventh and\r\neighth legislatures. Judges Welch and Wilder, W. C. Williston and\r\nWarren Bristol, lawyers, both state senators from Goodhue, and the\r\nlatter a judge in Arizona. Rev. Chauncey Hobart, D.D., a Methodist\r\npioneer preacher, and author of a history of Methodism in Minnesota\r\nand an autobiography; Rev. Peter Akers, D.D., an eminent educator;\r\nRev. M. Sorin, D.D., an eloquent preacher, and Rev. Samuel Spates and\r\nJ. W. Hancock, prominent as missionaries, the latter the first pastor\r\nlocated in the village. Andrew S. Durant, first hotel keeper; Calvin\r\nF. Potter, first merchant. W. W. Phelps and Christopher Graham were\r\nappointed to the land office in 1855.\r\n\r\n\r\nWABASHA COUNTY.\r\n\r\nThis county, named in honor of a Sioux chief, lies on the west shore\r\nof the Mississippi river and Lake Pepin, between Goodhue and Winona\r\ncounties. It has a majestic frontage of bold bluffs on the lake and\r\nriver. From the summit of these bluffs stretch away broad undulating\r\nprairie lands, with occasional depressions, or valleys, caused by the\r\nstreams tributary to the river.\r\n\r\nWabasha village is the county seat. The county is traversed by the St.\r\nPaul & Milwaukee railway, and the Zumbrota Valley Narrow Gauge\r\nrailroad has its eastern terminus at Wabasha village. A railroad from\r\nMinneiska to Eyota, in Olmsted county, through Plainview, also passes\r\nthrough this county. Lake City is a thriving village on the lake\r\nshore, beautifully situated. The Grand Encampment, located about two\r\nmiles below Wabasha village, was once a point of great interest. It\r\nwas from time immemorial a camping ground for Indians. It has an\r\nabundance of ancient mounds. The only people in the county in 1845,\r\nwhen the author first visited this section, were the Campbell, Cratt,\r\nBessian, and a few other French families. Bailey and sons, Dr. Francis\r\nH. Milligan, B. S. Hurd, Samuel S. Campbell, a prominent lawyer, and\r\nWm. L. Lincoln came later to Wabasha. Reed's Landing, at the foot of\r\nLake Pepin, was early settled by Messrs. Reed, Fordyce, Richards, and\r\nothers. This point controls an immense trade for the Chippewa river,\r\nwhich empties its waters into the Mississippi just opposite.\r\n\r\nNATHANIEL STACY TEFFT is a native of Hamilton, Madison county, New\r\nYork, where he was born July 16, 1830. He was educated in the common\r\nschools and academy; in 1848 commenced studying medicine and received\r\nhis diploma the same year at Cincinnati, after attending lectures at\r\nthe medical college in that city. In 1856 he came to Minnesota and\r\nlocated in Minneiska, where he practiced medicine, served as\r\npostmaster, justice of the peace, and member of the legislature. In\r\n1861 he removed to Plainview, where he has taken rank as a leading\r\nsurgeon and physician in that part of the State. He has also served as\r\nmember of the state senate (in 1871-72). The writer had the pleasure\r\nof meeting him in the legislature of 1858 and found him a strong\r\nopponent of the $5,000,000 bill. Dr. Tefft was married to Hattie S.\r\nGibbs, of Plainview, Nov. 10, 1866.\r\n\r\nJAMES WELLS.--In 1845 the writer found Mr. Wells living in a stone\r\ntrading house on the west shore of Lake Pepin, on the first high\r\nground on the shore above Lake City. Mr. Wells had a half-breed family\r\nand was very reticent in his manner. He was a member of the first\r\nterritorial house of representatives. When the country became more\r\nthickly settled he went West and was killed by the Sioux Indians in\r\nthe massacre of 1862.\r\n\r\n\r\nWINONA COUNTY\r\n\r\nWas named after the daughter of the Indian chief who, according to the\r\nwell known legend, precipitated herself from the famous rock on the\r\neastern shore of Lake Pepin, which has ever since been known as\r\n\"Maiden's Rock.\" The county lies on the west shore of the Mississippi,\r\nbelow Wabasha county. The frontage of the bluffs on the river is\r\nunsurpassed for grandeur and beauty, the bluffs here attaining an\r\naltitude of six hundred feet above the river. The natural castles and\r\nturrets crowning these bluffs remind the traveler of the towns on the\r\nRhine and Danube, and it is difficult to realize that they are the\r\nhandiwork of Nature and not of man. The most striking of these bluffs\r\noccupies a position in the rear of the beautiful city of Winona,\r\noverlooking the city and the valley, and affording from its summit\r\npossibly the finest view on the river. The city of Winona lies on a\r\nspacious plateau between the bluffs and the river. In 1845 a solitary\r\nlog cabin, the resting place of the mail carrier, marked the site, and\r\na large Indian village, belonging to the band of Chief Wapashaw,\r\noccupied a portion of the present site of the city. All traces of this\r\nvillage have long since disappeared, and given place to one of the\r\nfairest and most flourishing cities on the river. The First State\r\nNormal School is located here. The St. Paul & Milwaukee railroad\r\npasses through, and the Winona & St. Peter railroad has its eastern\r\nterminus in this city. It is also the western terminus of the Green\r\nBay & Mississippi. The Chicago, Burlington & Northern crosses the\r\nriver here, and has a depot in the city.\r\n\r\nDANIEL S. NORTON, at the time of his death United States senator from\r\nMinnesota, was born in Mount Vernon, Ohio, in April, 1829. He was\r\neducated at Kenyon College, Gambier, Ohio; enlisted in the Third Ohio\r\nVolunteer Infantry in 1846 for service in the Mexican War; had his\r\nhealth seriously impaired in the service; spent two years in\r\nCalifornia, Mexico and Central America; returned to Ohio and read law\r\nwith his father-in-law, Judge R. C. Hurd, practiced in Mount Vernon,\r\nOhio, with Hon. William Windom and came with him to Minnesota in 1855,\r\nlocating at Winona. Mr. Norton served as senator in the first state\r\nlegislature, where the writer served with him on several committees,\r\namong them the committee on the $5,000,000 bond bill, a bill which Mr.\r\nNorton strongly and earnestly opposed, predicting clearly its\r\ndisastrous results. He also served as senator in the legislatures of\r\n1861-64 and 65, when he was elected to the United States senate, which\r\nposition he held at the time of his death, in 1870. He was twice\r\nmarried, first in 1856, to Miss Lizzie Sherman, of Mount Vernon, Ohio,\r\nwho died in 1862. The second time to Miss Laura Cantlan, of Baltimore,\r\nin 1868.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM WINDOM, a native of Ohio, came to Winona in 1855. He had been\r\nadmitted to practice in 1853, and formed a partnership with D. S.\r\nNorton in Mount Vernon, Ohio, who came with him to Winona, where they\r\ncontinued their law partnership.

An obituary notice from the daily\r\npress gives a fair estimate of his character:\r\n\r\n\"He was not a man that mingled much in society or put himself forward\r\non any occasion, yet he had a very social, genial disposition, and\r\nevery one that knew him valued the acquaintance highly. As a judge he\r\nwas universally esteemed. His decisions were always marked by a\r\npeculiarly vigorous grasp of bottom facts. His mind was a naturally\r\njudicial one. His own ideas were fresh and original, and his way of\r\nexpressing them unusually vigorous. He devoted himself wholly to his\r\njudicial duties and to his family. He was a great reader and student\r\nand a great home man. His affections were wholly centred in his wife\r\nand children.

By virtue of De Soto's discovery of the Mississippi, the\r\nSpaniards now laid claim to the land along that river and its\r\ntributaries. They also claimed land lying along the Atlantic coast,\r\nwithout limit, northward. This large and somewhat indefinite empire\r\nwas by them styled Florida, after the name of the peninsula on which\r\nthey gained their first foothold. Unable to defend or enforce their\r\nclaims, they gradually relinquished them, giving up tract after tract,\r\nuntil the peninsula of Florida alone remained to them. This was ceded\r\nto the United States in 1819.\r\n\r\nThe government of the Territory was vested in the discoverers. Ponce\r\nde Leon was governor from 1512 until 1521. De Soto was governor of\r\nFlorida and Cuba until 1541. Melendez, by compact with King Philip,\r\nsucceeded him, his commission giving him a life tenure. The history of\r\nthe Spanish possessions is by no means interesting, and illustrates\r\nchiefly the Spanish greed for gold.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRENCH CLAIMS.\r\n\r\nThe French early disputed the claims of the Spaniards and Portuguese\r\nto the possession of the New World, and accordingly in 1524 sent a\r\nFlorentine, Jean Verrazzani, who explored the coast from Carolina to\r\nNova Scotia, took possession of it, and called it New France. Ten\r\nyears later Cartea continued the work, sailing around New Foundland\r\nand ascending the St. Lawrence as far as the site of Montreal. In 1564\r\na French colony located in Florida, but were almost immediately\r\nexterminated by the Spaniards. During the following century the French\r\npushed their explorations to the regions of the Mississippi and the\r\ngreat lakes. In the year 1603 Champlain was engaged in the exploration\r\nof the St. Lawrence, and in 1609, he, with two other Frenchmen,\r\nexplored Lake Champlain and the country of the Iroquois and took\r\npossession of it in the name of Henry IV of France. In 1611 and 1612\r\nhe explored Lake Huron, entered Saginaw bay, passed down Detroit\r\nriver, exploring Lake Erie, and laid the foundation of French\r\nsovereignty in the valley of the St. Lawrence. Champlain for many\r\nyears prosecuted the fur trade where Boston now stands, prior to the\r\nlanding of the Pilgrims at Plymouth Rock.\r\n\r\nWe have not space for a complete account of the conflicting claims of\r\nthe French and English, but will give the boundaries of New France as\r\ndefined by French and English authorities at different times: 1609--L'\r\nEscartot, in his \"Histoire de la Nouvelle France,\" defines the French\r\nboundaries as extending \"on the west to the Pacific ocean, on the\r\nsouth to the Spanish West Indies, on the east to the North Atlantic,\r\nand on the north to the Frozen Sea.\" 1683--Baron La Honton says, \"All\r\nthe world knows that Canada reaches from the 39th to the 65th degrees\r\nof north latitude and from the 284th to the 336th degrees of\r\nlongitude.\" [More accurately from about 45 to 90 degrees west, or from\r\nCape Race to the Mississippi.] The French government persistently\r\ndenied the right of the English to any territory west of the\r\nAlleghanies. The great Northwest, therefore, was for a long time under\r\nFrench rule and influence. We must accord to France the credit of\r\nmaking the first progress in civil government in the Northwest. They\r\nmade many permanent settlements and by a wise and pacific policy so\r\nconciliating the Indian tribes that they were able to hold their\r\npositions on the frontier at will. They were early and persistent\r\nexplorers, and, under the guidance of pious and devoted Jesuit\r\nmissionaries, planted settlements in the most desirable places. They\r\nmade a cordon of posts reaching from Louisiana to the Gulf of St.\r\nLawrence, along the Mississippi and Ohio rivers, and along the chain\r\nof the great lakes, completely surrounded the English colonies and\r\ndisputed with them the possession of the country. The French-English\r\nWar of 1689 to 1697 failed to decide satisfactorily the question of\r\nthe interior domain.\r\n\r\nIn 1712 New France was divided into two provinces, that of Canada and\r\nthat of Louisiana, the dividing line being the Ohio, Mississippi and\r\nMissouri rivers, the Mississippi boundary line extending from the\r\nmouth of the Ohio to the mouth of the Missouri river. Mobile was made\r\nthe capital of the southern province. The patent or commission of the\r\nnew province was issued to Crozat, Marquis du Chatel. The Illinois\r\ncountry was afterward added, and it seems probable that the country\r\neast of the Wabash was also included in it. All north of the boundary\r\nnamed formed part of the province of Canada. Other boundaries than\r\nthese have been given by geographers, but these boundaries are\r\nsufficiently established by official documents.\r\n\r\nIn 1763 all of the territory claimed by France lying east of the\r\nMississippi river was ceded to the English, the territory lying west\r\nto Spain. Virginia, by three royal charters, given in 1606, 1607 and\r\n1611, by the English government, held a part of the Northwest\r\nTerritory, and in 1776 established three counties north of the Ohio\r\nriver, named Ohio, Youghiogheny and Monongahela, but in 1787 ceded\r\nthis territory to the United States. Its settlement was somewhat\r\nimpeded by the perils of the wilderness, not the least of which was\r\nthe doubtful and often unfriendly attitude of the Indians, resulting\r\nin many cases from the changes in the tenure of the lands, and the\r\ninfluence of French or English emissaries, generally hostile to\r\nAmerican claims. The history of these early settlements is replete\r\nwith thrilling adventures.\r\n\r\nThe first settlement made in the newly ceded territory was at\r\nMarietta, Ohio, in 1788, under the supervision of Gen. Rufus Putnam,\r\nnephew of Gen. Israel Putnam, and first surveyor general of the\r\nNorthwest Territory. The settlement was named Marietta, in honor of\r\nQueen Marie Antoinette, who had been a firm friend to the colonies\r\nduring the Revolutionary struggle. Gen. Arthur St. Clair was appointed\r\ngovernor July 15, 1788, of the newly organized Ohio Territory.\r\n\r\nThe country claimed by Virginia under the royal charters included the\r\nland lying between the sea shore on the east, and the Mississippi on\r\nthe west, the Ohio river on the south, and the British possessions on\r\nthe north. It will be seen, therefore, that that part of the Northwest\r\nTerritory lying immediately along the eastern banks of the Mississippi\r\nnow comprised in the state of Wisconsin and part of Minnesota, has\r\nbeen successively claimed by Spain, France, England, Virginia, and the\r\nUnited States, and under the territorial governments of the\r\nNorthwest--Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin\r\nterritories. That part of Minnesota lying west of the Mississippi\r\nbelonged to the French by right of discovery, but passed into the\r\nhands of Spain, thence back again into the hands of France, by whom,\r\nwith the territory known as Louisiana, it was sold to the United\r\nStates in 1803. The original grant to Virginia included far more than\r\nthe area of the State and that of the Northwest Territory, but was\r\nsubsequently reduced by grants made by states lying north of Virginia,\r\nand vexatious disputes arose as to titles, a circumstance calculated\r\nto retard rapid settlement.\r\n\r\nWe append the following data concerning the early history of the\r\nterritory included in the present states of Wisconsin and Minnesota,\r\ntabulated for more convenient reference:\r\n\r\n1634. Jean Nicollet ventured into Wisconsin, and explored the country\r\nfrom Lake Michigan for a considerable distance down the Wisconsin\r\nriver.\r\n\r\n1658.

About the first of May Father Louis Hennepin arrived at Mille\r\nLacs, as prisoner of a Dakotah war party, who captured him at Lake\r\nPepin, while on his way up the Mississippi. He remained at Mille Lacs\r\nseveral months. On his return homeward, after being released, he\r\ndiscovered the falls, which he named for his patron saint, Anthony of\r\nPadua. His book, published after his return to Europe, is the first\r\nprinted account of Minnesota.\r\n\r\n1683. Le Sueur made a voyage of the Fog and Wisconsin rivers to the\r\nMississippi.\r\n\r\n1688.

Gorrell, abandoned Green Bay in\r\nconsequence of the Indian War under Pontiac.\r\n\r\nTreaty of Paris, by which all the territory of New France, including\r\nWisconsin, was surrendered to the English.\r\n\r\nAbout this date the Canadian-French trading establishment at Green Bay\r\nripened into a permanent settlement, the first upon any portion of the\r\nterritory now forming the state of Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nBy the treaty of Versailles, France ceded Minnesota east of the\r\nMississippi to England, and west of it to Spain.\r\n\r\n1766. Capt. Jonathan Carver visited St. Anthony falls and Minnesota\r\nriver.

This bill established the present boundary. The\r\nmajority of the people residing in the valley of the St. Croix were\r\nopposed to it on the ground that the interests of the valley on both\r\nsides were identical, and that it was not proper that the two sides\r\nshould be separated by a state line. The question became a political\r\none, and at the election of delegates for the constitutional\r\nconvention of Oct. 5, 1846, Wm. Holcombe was elected over Joseph\r\nBowron, as representing the sentiments of the people of the valley as\r\nopposed to the proposed boundary line.\r\n\r\nIn convention Mr. Holcombe advocated a boundary line commencing at\r\nMount Trempeleau on the Mississippi, running due north to Lake\r\nSuperior. Failing in this, he advocated a boundary line to be\r\nestablished at a point fifteen miles due east of the most easterly\r\npoint on Lake St. Croix, said line extending from that point due south\r\nto the Mississippi and due north to the tributary waters of Lake\r\nSuperior. In this he was successful, and the constitution in which\r\nthis boundary line was thus fixed went to the people and was rejected,\r\ngreatly to the disappointment of the people of the St. Croix valley,\r\nwho felt that they had been unjustly dealt with. There seems, indeed,\r\nto be but little excuse for the attitude of the majority of the\r\ncitizens of Wisconsin with regard to this boundary. Certainly but\r\nlittle attention was shown to the interests of the people in the\r\nwestern section of the Territory.\r\n\r\nPrior to the meeting of the second constitutional convention, Dec. 15,\r\n1847, public meetings were held at St. Croix Falls and in Stillwater,\r\nat which latter place enthusiastic resolutions were passed\r\nremonstrating against this unnatural boundary, which resolutions were\r\nsigned by nearly all the citizens of the St. Croix valley, and a few\r\nin and around St. Paul, asking the convention to establish the western\r\nboundary on a line running due north from the foot of Lake Pepin to\r\nLake Superior. George W. Brownell was elected from the St. Croix\r\ndistrict to the second convention, with instructions to work for this\r\nboundary. Joseph Bowron, Brownell's opponent, was defeated by a large\r\nmajority. The following is the abstract of votes:\r\n\r\n                                 BOWRON.          BROWNELL.\r\n    Willow River (now Hudson)       7                 4\r\n    Lake St. Croix                  7                14\r\n    Stillwater                      9                39\r\n    St. Paul                       41                40\r\n    Marine Mills                  ...                22\r\n    St. Croix Falls                26                18\r\n    Clam River                      6                17\r\n    Apple River                     1                 6\r\n    Wood Lake                       2                 6\r\n    Rush Lake                       2                 8\r\n    Osceola (no election)         ---               ---\r\n     Totals                       101               174\r\n\r\nMr. Brownell made strong and persistent efforts to have the boundary\r\nline adjusted in accordance with the sentiments of the people of the\r\nvalley, but in vain. Morgan L. Martin, delegate to Congress from\r\nWisconsin Territory, had framed the bill establishing the present\r\nboundary, and it was urged that any effort to change the line would\r\ntend to prevent the immediate admission of the State, and it was\r\nthought a political necessity that the State should be admitted at\r\nonce, that it might take part in the ensuing presidential election.\r\nUnder such pressure the convention made haste to adopt, and the people\r\nto accept, a constitution with boundary lines that should never have\r\nbeen made. The State was admitted in time to cast its electoral vote\r\nfor Gen. Zachary Taylor and Millard Fillmore.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting held by the people of the St. Croix valley, subsequent\r\nto this convention and prior to its adoption by the people, the\r\nfollowing resolutions were passed, and we append them as expressing\r\nvery generally the sentiments of the people of the valley:\r\n\r\nWHEREAS, By the establishment of the St. Croix river as a part of the\r\nboundary line between the State and territory of Wisconsin, the\r\ninhabitants of our remote settlements are greatly aggrieved, our local\r\nrights and privileges neglected and abridged, our geographical,\r\nmaterial and natural political alliance with our neighbors of the new\r\nterritory will be cut off; and\r\n\r\nWHEREAS, Our oft repeated remonstrances and appeals to the authorities\r\nof the new state have been unavailing; therefore\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That the establishment of the St. Croix river as a part of\r\nthe boundary of the state of Wisconsin, against the will of the\r\ninhabitants of the valley of said river, is unjust, unreasonable and\r\ncontrary to the principles upon which our government is founded.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That in establishing the present boundary, our known and\r\nacknowledged wishes and interests are invaded by the might of a\r\nmajority; that as the boundary is now established, so great is the\r\ndistance and obstacles intervening, severing us, together with the\r\npeople of Lake Superior, from the seat of government, that we can not\r\nenjoy a prompt and equitable share in representation, and we would\r\nrespectfully admonish our brethren that equal representation involves\r\na principle which is deeply and peculiarly American.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That the interests of the inhabitants of St. Croix, being\r\nidentical from the nature of the staple business of the country, the\r\nriver being the natural centre to which all the business of the valley\r\ntends, a boundary severing the natural ties in connection is uncalled\r\nfor, inconvenient and vexatious.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That the inhabitants of the territory of the whole\r\nNorthwest are deeply interested in procuring a just and wise\r\nalteration of the present line of divisions, because from the\r\ngeography of the country, the line as now established, we are robbed\r\nof a future star in the galaxy of the American sisterhood of states.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That we pledge ourselves to stand united and unceasingly\r\nuse all honorable means in our power to procure the establishment of a\r\nboundary east of St. Croix valley.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That a committee of three be appointed to prepare and\r\nforward a memorial to the present legislature on this subject.\r\n\r\nThe resolutions as a whole were unanimously adopted.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the last resolution the chair appointed Wm. R.\r\nMarshall, G. W. Brownell and W. H. C. Folsom, Esqs., a committee.\r\n\r\nOn motion the secretary was instructed to forward copies of the\r\nproceedings of the meeting to the Prairie du Chien _Patriot_, Galena\r\n_Gazette_ and Wisconsin _Argus_, requesting their publication.\r\n\r\n                        H. H. PERKINS,\r\n                        _Chairman_.\r\n\r\n                        R. V. D. SMITH,\r\n                        _Secretary_.\r\n\r\nNo attention was paid to the action of the public meeting. It is\r\npossible that none was expected. It was some satisfaction to the\r\npeople of the valley to give such an expression of their opinion of\r\nthe wrong done them. The admission of Wisconsin with the St. Croix as\r\na boundary line left the country immediately west of that river\r\nvirtually without law. Nevertheless, Wisconsin territorial laws were\r\nacknowledged west of the St. Croix and were generally considered\r\nbinding until a new territorial government should be organized. The\r\nterritorial governor, Gen. Henry Dodge, had been elected United States\r\nsenator and therefore could not claim jurisdiction over this part of\r\nthe territory lying beyond state limits. John Catlin, territorial\r\nsecretary, held that the territorial government still existed in the\r\npart of the original territory excluded.\r\n\r\nAt a public meeting held in Stillwater, Aug. 26, 1848 (a preliminary\r\nmeeting having been held August 24th, at which an understanding was\r\neffected with Mr. Catlin and he invited to exercise authority as a\r\nterritorial officer), steps were taken for the organization of a new\r\nterritory, and Mr. Catlin, having removed to Stillwater, issued a\r\nproclamation in his official capacity, ordering an election to be held\r\nfor the selection of a delegate to Congress. To facilitate this\r\nmovement John H. Tweedy, territorial delegate from Wisconsin,\r\nresigned. The election was held Oct. 30, 1848, and H. H. Sibley was\r\nelected as a successor to John H. Tweedy, his papers being certified\r\nby John Catlin, secretary of Wisconsin Territory. Mr. Sibley proceeded\r\nto Washington, presented his credentials and patiently awaited\r\nrecognition, which was not very speedily accorded, there being\r\nconsiderable discussion as to the right of excluded territory to\r\ncontinued political existence. His admission, on the fifteenth of\r\nJanuary, as a delegate, settled the question and established a\r\nprecedent that the creation of a state government does not deprive\r\nportions of the territory not included within state limits of the\r\nright to existence and representation. Mr. Sibley ably presented the\r\nclaims of his constituents and with great difficulty succeeded in\r\nprocuring the passage of a bill organizing the new territory of\r\nMinnesota.\r\n\r\nWith all respect to the action of Congress in receiving Mr. Sibley as\r\na legally elected delegate (and, under the circumstances, the action\r\nseems wise), the question still rises: \"Had we a legal territorial\r\ngovernment?\" If we had, what was the necessity for a new organization?\r\nWhy could not the excluded territory continue under the old _regime_,\r\nor inherit, so to speak, the old government machinery? If we had no\r\nlegal existence, by what authority could Mr. Sibley represent us? The\r\nWisconsin territorial government had ceased to exist. Ours had not\r\nbegun to live.\r\n\r\nThe territory of Minnesota was created by act of Congress, March 3,\r\n1849, a little over thirty days after the introduction of the bill\r\ncreating it. There had been some discussion as to the name. In the\r\nbill presented by Morgan L. Martin it was named Minnesota. Senator\r\nStephen A. Douglas, chairman of the committee on territories,\r\nrecommended the passage of the bill, and that the new territory be\r\nnamed Itasca. When the bill was before the house the names Chippewa,\r\nJackson and Washington were proposed, but the name in the original\r\nbill was adopted. It is a compound word, taken from the Sioux\r\nlanguage, and has for its meaning \"Land of sky-tinted water.\" The news\r\nof the passage of the bill reached Stillwater April 9th, and was\r\nreceived with great rejoicing.\r\n\r\nThe United States land office which had been established at St. Croix\r\nFalls in 1848 was removed to Stillwater July 1, 1849. Abraham Van\r\nVoorhes was appointed register and William Holcombe receiver.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIAN TREATIES.\r\n\r\nSept. 23, 1805, at the mouth of St. Peter's river (now Mendota) with\r\nthe Sioux. (For account of this treaty see \"Gen. Pike and the\r\nIndians.\")\r\n\r\nJuly 29, 1837, at St. Peter (now Mendota), Wisconsin Territory, the\r\nChippewa Indians ceded to the United States the following tract of\r\ncountry: Beginning at the junction of the Crow Wing and Mississippi\r\nrivers, between twenty and thirty miles, above where the Mississippi\r\nis crossed by the forty-sixth parallel of north latitude, and running\r\nthence to the north point of Lake St. Croix, one of the sources of the\r\nSt. Croix river; thence to and along the dividing ridge between the\r\nwaters of Lake Superior and those of the Mississippi, to the sources\r\nof the Ochasua-sepe, a tributary of the Chippewa river; thence to a\r\npoint on the Chippewa river twenty miles below the outlet of Lake De\r\nFlambeau; thence to the junction of the Wisconsin and Pelican rivers;\r\nthence on an east course twenty-five miles; thence southerly on a\r\ncourse parallel with that of the Wisconsin river to the line dividing\r\nthe territories of the Chippewas and the Menomonies; thence to the\r\nPlover portage; thence along the southern boundary of the Chippewa\r\ncountry to the commencement of the boundary line dividing it from that\r\nof the Sioux, half a day's march below the falls on the Chippewa\r\nriver; thence with said boundary line to the month of the Waw-tab[F]\r\nriver, at its junction with the Mississippi; and thence up the\r\nMississippi to the place of beginning.\r\n\r\n                        HENRY DODGE,\r\n                        _Commissioner_.\r\n\r\nSept. 29, 1837, at Washington, District of Columbia, the Sioux nation\r\nof Indians ceded to the United States all their lands east of the\r\nMississippi river, and all of their islands in the said river, Joel R.\r\nPoinsett, secretary of war, commanding, which cession embraced all\r\ntheir land east of the Mississippi and west of the following lines\r\ncommencing at the Chippewa river, half a day's march below the falls,\r\nfrom thence to Red Cedar river, immediately below the falls; thence to\r\nthe St. Croix river at a point called the Standing Cedar, about a\r\nday's paddle in a canoe, above the lake at the mouth of that river;\r\nthence passing between two lakes called by the Chippewas, \"Green,\r\nLakes,\" and by the Sioux, \"The Lakes they Bury the Eagles in,\" thence\r\nto the Standing Cedar, that \"the Sioux split;\" thence to Rum river,\r\ncrossing at the mouth of a small creek called Choking creek, a long\r\nday's march from the Mississippi; thence to a point of woods that\r\nproject into the prairie, half a day's march from the Mississippi;\r\nthence in a straight line to the mouth of the first river which enters\r\nthe Mississippi at the east side above the mouth of Sac river (Watab\r\nriver). The above boundary line was established between the Sioux and\r\nChippewa Indiana at Prairie du Chien, Aug. 19, 1825.\r\n\r\n                        WILLIAM CLARK,\r\n                        LEWIS CASS,\r\n                        _Commissioners_.\r\n\r\nSt. Paul, East Minneapolis and Stillwater are embraced within the\r\nabove limits.\r\n\r\nNov. 1, 1837, at Washington, District of Columbia, with the\r\nWinnebagoes.\r\n\r\nThe Winnebagoes at this treaty ceded all their lands lying east of the\r\nMississippi river, and received in return $200,000. Of this amount\r\n$150,000 was reserved to satisfy the claims of Indian traders, and the\r\nremaining $50,000 was paid to certain individuals of the tribe. There\r\nwas set apart the further sum of $100,000, to be paid, by order of the\r\npresident of the United States, to mixed blood relatives of these\r\nIndiana. Simon Cameron, of Pennsylvania, and James Murray, of\r\nMaryland, were commissioned to adjust claims, pay debts and partition\r\nthe amount alloted to the mixed bloods. The Winnebagoes, including\r\nmixed blood relatives, numbered over 4,000 souls. The payments and\r\nadjustments were made at Prairie du Chien, October, 1838. Soon after\r\ncomplaints were made of the arbitrary and unjust distribution of these\r\nfunds. The secretary of war, Joel R. Poinsett, countermanded the\r\naction of the commissioners and appointed Judge Fleming, of New York,\r\nto act as commissioner. The parties were reassembled at Prairie du\r\nChien in September, 1839, and the unpleasant business was in some way\r\nadjusted and closed up.\r\n\r\nAug. 2, 1847, at Fond du Lac of Lake Superior, the Chippewa Indians of\r\nthe Mississippi and Lake Superior ceded to the United States the\r\ncountry beginning at the junction of the Crow Wing and Mississippi\r\nrivers, thence up the Crow Wing river to the junction of that river\r\nwith the Long Prairie river; thence up the Long Prairie river to the\r\nboundary line between the Sioux and Chippewa Indians; thence southerly\r\nalong said boundary line to a lake at the head of Long Prairie river;\r\nthence in a direct line to the sources of the (Waw-tab) river; thence\r\ndown that river to its junction with the Mississippi river; thence up\r\nthe Mississippi river to the place of beginning.\r\n\r\n                        ISSAC A. VERPLANCK,\r\n                        HENRY M. RICE,\r\n                        _Commissioners_.\r\n\r\nAug. 21, 1847, at Leech Lake, the Pillager band of Chippewa Indians\r\nceded to the United States the country beginning at the south end of\r\nOtter Tail lake; thence southerly on the boundary line between the\r\nSioux and Chippewa Indians to Long Prairie river; thence up said river\r\nto Crow Wing river; thence up Crow Wing river to Leaf river; thence up\r\nLeaf river to its head; thence in a direct line to the place of\r\nbeginning.\r\n\r\n                        ISSAC A. VERPLANCK,\r\n                        HENRY M. RICE,\r\n                        _Commissioners_.\r\n\r\nJuly 23, 1851, at Traverse des Sioux (now St. Peter), the See-see-toan\r\nand Wah-pay-toan bands of Dakotah or Sioux Indians ceded to the United\r\nStates all their lands in the state of Iowa; and the territory of\r\nMinnesota, lying east of a line beginning at the junction of the\r\nBuffalo river and the Red River of the North; thence along the western\r\nbank of said river to the mouth of the Sioux Wood river; thence along\r\nthe western bank of said Sioux Wood river to Lake Traverse; thence\r\nalong the western shore of said lake to the northern extremity\r\nthereof; thence in a direct line to the junction of Kampeska lake with\r\nthe Tchan-kas-an-data or Sioux river; thence along the western bank of\r\nsaid river to its point of intersection with the northern line of the\r\nstate of Iowa, including all the islands in said rivers and lake.\r\n\r\n                        LUKE LEA, Commissioner of Indian Affairs,\r\n                        ALEXANDER RAMSEY, Governor and\r\n                        _Ex-officio_ Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\r\n                        _Commissioners_.\r\n\r\nA small reservation was set apart for said Indians, which they\r\nforfeited by their attack upon the whites in 1862.\r\n\r\nAug. 5, 1851, at Mendota, the Med-ay-wa-kan-toan and Wah-pay-koo-tay\r\nbands of Dakotah and Sioux Indians ceded to the United States all of\r\ntheir lands in the territory of Minnesota and state of Iowa.\r\n\r\n                        LUKE LEA,\r\n                        ALEXANDER RAMSEY,\r\n                        _Commissioners_.\r\n\r\nThe two treaties made by Commissioners Lea and Ramsey included the\r\nfollowing area:\r\n\r\nBeginning at the junction of Buffalo river with the Red River of the\r\nNorth, in Clay county; thence along the western bank of the Red River\r\nof the north to the mouth of Sioux Wood river; thence along the\r\nwestern bank of Sioux Wood river to Lake Traverse; thence along its\r\nwestern shore to its southern extremity; thence to the head of Sioux\r\nriver; thence along said Sioux river to the northern line of the state\r\nof Iowa; thence along the southern boundary of the state of Minnesota\r\nto the Mississippi river; thence up said river to the mouth of Waw-tab\r\nriver (just north of St. Cloud in Stearns county); thence up that\r\nriver to its head; thence to the place of beginning. A part of the\r\nstate of Iowa not included in the above was also ceded to the United\r\nStates. A large strip of Dakota Territory is included. This last tract\r\nincludes nearly one-half of the state of Minnesota, containing its now\r\nrichest and most populous counties.\r\n\r\nSept. 30, 1854, at La Pointe, Lake Superior, Wisconsin, the Chippewas\r\nof Lake Superior ceded to the United States all of their lands lying\r\neast of a line beginning at a point where the east branch of Snake\r\nriver crosses the southern boundary line of the Chippewa country,\r\nrunning thence up the said branch to its source; thence nearly north\r\nin a straight line to the mouth of East Savannah river; thence up the\r\nSt. Louis river to the mouth of East Swan river; thence up the East\r\nSwan river to its source; thence in a straight line to the most\r\nwesterly bend of Vermillion river, and thence down the Vermillion\r\nriver to its mouth.\r\n\r\n                        HENRY C. GILBERT,\r\n                        DAVID B. HERRIMAN,\r\n                        _Commissioners_.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing treaty embraced all of the country bordering upon Lake\r\nSuperior in the state of Minnesota, including the valuable iron and\r\nother mines.\r\n\r\nThe city of Duluth is within the limits of the cession.\r\n\r\nOwing to the efforts of Henry M. Rice, then in Congress, the\r\ncommissioners were appointed, and to his personal influence with the\r\nChippewas the treaty was made.\r\n\r\nFeb. 22, 1885, at Washington, District of Columbia, the Mississippi,\r\nPillager, and Lake Winnibigoshish bands of Chippewa Indians ceded to\r\nthe United States all the lands owned or claimed by them in the\r\nterritory of Minnesota, and included within the following boundaries,\r\nviz.: \"Beginning at a point where the east branch of Snake river\r\ncrosses the southern boundary line of the Chippewa country, east of\r\nthe Mississippi river, as established by the treaty of July 29, 1837,\r\nrunning thence up the said branch to its source; thence nearly north\r\nin a straight line to the mouth of East Savannah river; thence up the\r\nSt. Louis river to the mouth of East Swan river; thence up said river\r\nto its source; thence in a straight line to the most westerly bend of\r\nVermillion river; thence northwestwardly in a straight line to the\r\nfirst and most considerable bend in the Big Fork river; thence down\r\nsaid river to its mouth; thence down Rainy Lake river to the mouth of\r\nBlack river; thence up that river to its source; thence in a straight\r\nline to the northern extremity of Turtle Lake; thence in a straight\r\nline to the mouth of Wild Rice river; thence up the Red River of the\r\nNorth to the mouth of Buffalo river; thence in a straight line to the\r\nsouthwestern extremity of Otter Tail lake; thence through said lake to\r\nthe source of Leaf river; thence down said river to its junction with\r\nCrow Wing river; thence down Crow Wing river to its junction with the\r\nMississippi river; thence to the place of beginning.\"\r\n\r\n                        GEORGE W. MANYPENNY,\r\n                        _Commissioner_.\r\n\r\nAll lands in Minnesota Territory east of the foregoing boundary line\r\nwere ceded to the United States at La Pointe, Lake Superior, Sept. 30,\r\n1854. Several reservations were set aside in each purchase for the\r\nfuture residence of various bands of said Chippewa and Pillager\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\nIt was by the efforts of Henry M. Rice, then in Congress, that the\r\nIndians were invited to Washington, and through his personal influence\r\nthat the treaty was made. Several treaties were afterward made with\r\nthe Chippewa and Pillager Indians, merely changing or reducing their\r\nreservation.\r\n\r\nOct. 2, 1863, at the old crossing of the Red Lake river, in the state\r\nof Minnesota, the Red Lake and Pembina bands of Chippewa Indians ceded\r\nto the United States all their right, title and interest in and to all\r\nthe lands now owned and claimed by them in the state of Minnesota and\r\nin the territory of Dakota within the following boundaries, to wit:\r\n\"Beginning at the point where the international boundary between the\r\nUnited States and the British possessions intersects the shore of the\r\nLake of the Woods; thence in a direct line southwestwardly to the head\r\nof Thief river; thence down the main channel of said Thief river to\r\nits mouth on the Red Lake river; thence in a southeasterly direction,\r\nin a direct line toward the head of Wild Rice river, to a point where\r\nsuch line would intersect the northwestern boundary of a tract ceded\r\nto the United States by a treaty concluded at Washington on the\r\ntwenty-second day of February, 1855, with the Mississippi, Pillager\r\nand Lake Winnibigoshish bands of Chippewa Indians; thence along said\r\nboundary line of said cession to the mouth of Wild Rice river; thence\r\nup the main channel of the Red river to the mouth of the Sheyenne;\r\nthence up the main channel of the Sheyenne river to Poplar Grove;\r\nthence in a direct line to the head of the main branch of Salt river;\r\nthence in a direct line due north to the international boundary line;\r\nthence eastwardly to the place of beginning.\"\r\n\r\n                        ALEXANDER RAMSEY,\r\n                        ASHLEY C. MORRILL,\r\n                        _Commissioners_.\r\n\r\nAll the lands included in the foregoing treaty east of the Red River\r\nof the North are within the state of Minnesota.\r\n\r\nThe heretofore mentioned treaties include all the lands within the\r\nstate of Minnesota originally owned by Indian tribes, except the Red\r\nLake reservation, and for its cession a treaty was negotiated in 1886,\r\nwhich to this date, April, 1888, has not been ratified.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEN. PIKE AND THE INDIANS.\r\n\r\nGen. Zebulon M. Pike, United States Army, was sent by the government\r\nin 1805-6 on a tour of inspection, to select sites for forts, and to\r\ntreat and hold councils with the various Indian tribes of the Upper\r\nMississippi. He met the Sioux in council at the junction of the St.\r\nPeter's and Mississippi rivers, Sept. 23, 1805, and informed them\r\nthat he came to purchase lands for government forts, and to tell them\r\nwhat the Great Father at Washington desired them to know about his\r\npeople and their government. A part of his speech we subjoin:\r\n\r\n\"BROTHERS: You old men probably know that about thirty years ago we\r\nwere subject to the king of England, and governed by his laws. But he\r\nnot treating us as children we refused to acknowledge him as father.\r\nAfter ten years of war, in which he lost 100,000 men, he acknowledged\r\nus as a free and independent nation. They knew that not many years\r\nsince we received Detroit, Michilmackinac, and all the ports on the\r\nlakes from the English, and now but the other day, Louisiana from the\r\nSpanish; so that we put one foot on the sea at the east, and the other\r\non the sea at the west, and if once children are now men; yet I think\r\nthat the traders who come from Canada are bad birds amongst the\r\nChippewas, and instigate them to make war on their red brothers, the\r\nSioux, in order to prevent our traders from going high up the\r\nMississippi. This I shall inquire into, and so warn those persons of\r\ntheir ill conduct.\r\n\r\n\"Brothers, I expect that you will give orders to all your young\r\nwarriors to respect my flag and protection, which I may send to the\r\nChippewa chief who may come down with me in the spring; for was a dog\r\nto run to my lodge for safety, his enemy must walk over me to hurt\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"Brothers, I am told that the traders have made a practice of selling\r\nrum to you. All of you in your right senses must know that this is\r\ninjurious and occasions quarrels, murders, etc., amongst yourselves.\r\nFor this reason your father has thought proper to prohibit the traders\r\nfrom selling you rum.\r\n\r\n\"Brothers, I now present you with some of your father's tobacco, and\r\nsome other trifling things, as a memorandum of my good will, and\r\nbefore my departure _I will give you some liquor to clear your\r\nthroats_.\"\r\n\r\nAt this conference the Sioux granted to the United States government a\r\ntract nine miles square at the mouth of the St. Croix, and a similar\r\ntract at the mouth of the St. Peter's, lying on both sides of the\r\nMississippi and including the falls of St. Anthony. Pike says: \"They\r\ngave the land required, about 100,000 acres of land (equal to\r\n$200,000), and promised me a safe passage for myself and any chief I\r\nmight bring down. I gave them presents to the amount of about two\r\nhundred dollars, and as soon as the council was over allowed the\r\ntraders to present them with liquor which, with what I gave, was equal\r\nto sixty gallons.\" Pike in his journeying through the territory\r\nordered Dickson and others to haul down the British flag. It is on\r\nrecord that the flags were hauled down, but also that they were\r\nhoisted again after Pike's departure.\r\n\r\nFrom Pike's own account of one of his inland tours he was hospitably\r\nentertained by his red brothers, as the following paragraph from his\r\njournal will show:\r\n\r\n\"After making this tour we returned to the chief's lodge and found a\r\nberth provided for each of us, of good soft bear skins nicely spread,\r\nand on mine there was a large feather pillow. I must not here omit to\r\nmention an anecdote which serves to characterize more particularly\r\ntheir manners. This, in the eyes of the contracted moralist, would\r\ndeform my hospitable host into a monster of libertinism; but by a\r\nliberal mind would be considered as arising from the hearty generosity\r\nof the wild savage. In the course of the day, observing a ring on one\r\nof my fingers, he inquired if it was gold; he was told it was the gift\r\nof one with whom I should be happy to be at that time; he seemed to\r\nthink seriously, and at night told my interpreter, 'that perhaps his\r\nfather (as they all called me) felt much grieved for the want of a\r\nwoman; if so, he could furnish him with one.' He was answered that\r\nwith us each man had but one wife, and that I considered it strictly\r\nmy duty to remain faithful to her. This he thought strange (he himself\r\nhaving three) and replied that 'he knew some Americans at his nation\r\nwho had half a dozen wives during the winter.' The interpreter\r\nobserved that they were men without character; but that all our great\r\nmen had each but one wife. The chief acquiesced; but said he liked\r\nbetter to have as many as he pleased.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ESTABLISHMENT OF UNITED STATES SURVEYS IN THE NORTHWEST--A\r\nCONDENSED STATEMENT FROM THE RECORDS OF THE BOOKS IN THE SURVEYOR\r\nGENERAL'S OFFICE.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-sixth day of January, 1796, when the American Congress\r\nwas in session at Philadelphia, a bill was reported for establishing\r\nland offices in the Northwestern Territory. The bill was ably\r\ndiscussed and there was much variance of opinion as to the\r\ndisposition of the lands to be surveyed and brought into the market.\r\nSome favored a proposition to give the lands to actual settlers, and\r\nothers favored selling the lands at a stipulated price, applying the\r\nproceeds to the payment of the national debt. The bill, when agreed\r\nupon, bore the following title: \"An act providing for the sale of the\r\nlands of the United States in the territories northwest of the river\r\nOhio, and above the mouth of the Kentucky river.\" The bill was\r\napproved by President Washington May 18, 1796.\r\n\r\nThis law established the office of surveyor general with powers\r\nspecifically limited. It directed him to run lines north and south\r\naccording to the true meridian, to be known as range lines, and\r\nothers, crossing them at right angles, to be known as township lines,\r\nthe townships thus formed to consist of areas six miles square, the\r\nwhole to be subdivided into 36 sections, each a mile square, each to\r\ncontain 640 acres of land, as near as may be, and to be subdivided\r\ninto quarters, containing 160 acres, and these quarters to be further\r\nsubdivided into forties. Marks were to be established at the corners\r\nof every township and section. These surveys were not to conflict with\r\nIndian treaty and military land warrants, or the course of navigable\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\nThis admirable device for surveying the public lands grew out of a\r\ncorrespondence between Gen. Rufus Putnam and President Washington, in\r\n1875, in which the former proposed the division of the public lands\r\ninto townships six miles square, to be marked by township and range\r\nlines. Perhaps no more convenient and acceptable plan of survey could\r\nhave been devised. Gen. Benjamin Tupper was one of a company of\r\nsurveyors in 1796 that established the first lines under this new\r\nsystem. This survey was made in Southeast Ohio.\r\n\r\nThe first surveyor general's office was opened at Marietta, Ohio, soon\r\nafter the approval of the bill, and Rufus Putnam was appointed\r\nsurveyor general. In 1803 he was removed by President Jefferson and\r\nthe office was located at Vincennes. A year later it was removed to\r\nCincinnati, in 1814 to Chillicothe, in 1829 to Cincinnati, in 1845 to\r\nDetroit, and in 1857 to St. Paul, where it has since remained. The act\r\nfor the survey of the public lands has since been modified and\r\nimproved. In 1804 an act was approved providing for the marking of\r\nquarter sections on the section lines.\r\n\r\nBy the same law under which the lands were subdivided and opened to\r\nthe public, one section, No. 16, in every township was reserved from\r\nsale for the support of common schools. Two townships were also set\r\napart for the support of a university. This was the beginning of the\r\ndonations of land for school and other purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNITED STATES LAND OFFICE.\r\n\r\nThe first government land office in Wisconsin north of Mineral Point\r\nwas located at St. Croix Falls in 1848. Township plats were received,\r\nlands advertised and offered for sale in September, covering the\r\nground where the cities of Stillwater and St. Paul are now located,\r\nand adjacent country. The office was removed to Stillwater in 1849,\r\nand the land district divided by the St. Croix river. The land office\r\nfor the east side was located at Willow River in 1849, and there\r\nremained till 1860, when it was removed to St. Croix Falls. The\r\nfollowing are the receivers and registers:\r\n\r\n    1848. Samuel Leach, receiver; Charles S. Whiting, register.\r\n    1849. Moses S. Gibson, receiver; T. D. Catlin, register.\r\n    1853.

The oldest record to be\r\nfound in the office is the proving up by James Purinton of his\r\npre-emption, July 24, 1848. The first recorded correspondence is a\r\nletter from S. Leach, receiver, to Geo. W. Jones, surveyor general,\r\nDubuque, Iowa. In June, 1863, under the receivership of Mr. Reynolds,\r\nthe safe in the office was blown open with powder and the contents\r\nstolen. Some time afterward, in 1865, fifty land warrants and a bunch\r\nof keys from the articles missing were thrown in at the office\r\nwindow. They had the appearance of having been buried in the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST ENTRIES.\r\n\r\nJuly 24, 1848. James Purinton, residence, St. Croix Falls.

Its most important measure was the passage of the $5,000,000\r\nloan bill. At the twentieth session a law was passed changing the\r\nsessions of the legislature from annual to biennial.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION OF 1857.\r\n\r\nAs a delegate to the constitutional convention of 1857, and a member\r\nof what was styled the Republican wing, the writer considers it not\r\namiss to insert a chapter concerning that somewhat famous and farcical\r\naffair.\r\n\r\nThe Congress of 1856-57 passed an enabling act for the formation of a\r\nstate government in Minnesota, providing that a constitutional\r\nconvention of delegates, chosen by the people, should assemble at\r\nmidday, July 13, 1857, at the hall of the house of representatives at\r\nthe state capitol, and adopt a constitution, subject to the\r\nratification of the people.\r\n\r\nThe territorial governor, Samuel Medary, ordered an election to be\r\nheld on the first Monday in June, 1857, for delegates, the number to\r\nconsist of one hundred and eight. The State was nearly equally divided\r\nbetween the Republicans and Democrats; still the question of politics\r\ndid not enter largely into the contest, except as a question of party\r\nsupremacy. The people were a unit on the question of organizing a\r\nstate government under the enabling act, and in many cases there was\r\nbut a single ticket in the field. It was a matter, therefore, of some\r\nsurprise that there should be a separation among the delegates into\r\nopposing factions, resulting practically in the formation of two\r\nconventions, each claiming to represent the people, and each proposing\r\na constitution. The delegates, although but 108 were called, were\r\nnumbered on the rolls of the two wings as 59 Republican and 53\r\nDemocratic, a discrepancy arising from some irregularity of\r\nenrollment, by which certain memberships were counted twice. The\r\nRepublican members, claiming a bare majority, took possession of the\r\nhall of the house at midnight, twelve hours before the legal time for\r\nopening the convention, the object being to obtain control of the\r\noffices and committees of the convention, a manifest advantage in the\r\nmatter of deciding upon contested seats.\r\n\r\nIn obedience to the call of the leaders of the party, issued the day\r\nbefore, the writer with other Republicans repaired to the house at the\r\nappointed hour, produced his credentials as a delegate, and was\r\nconducted into the illuminated hall by Hon. John W. North. The\r\ndelegates were dispersed variously about the hall, some chatting\r\ntogether, others reading newspapers, smoking, or snoring, as here and\r\nthere one had fallen asleep in his seat. Occasionally a delegate\r\nnervously examined his revolver as if he anticipated some necessity\r\nfor its use.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic delegates were elsewhere probably plotting in secret\r\nconclave to capture the hall, and perhaps it might be well enough to\r\nbe prepared for the worst. Thus the remainder of the night passed and\r\nthe forenoon of July 13th. As soon as the clock struck twelve, the\r\nDemocratic delegates rushed tumultuously in, as if with the purpose of\r\ncapturing the speaker's stand. That, however, was already occupied by\r\nthe Republican delegates, and the storming party was obliged to\r\ncontent itself with the lower steps of the stand. Both parties at the\r\nmoment the clock ceased striking were yelling \"order\" vociferously,\r\nand nominating their officers, _pro tem._ Both parties effected a\r\ntemporary organization, although in the uproar and confusion it was\r\ndifficult to know what was done.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic wing adjourned at once to the senate chamber, and there\r\neffected a permanent organization. The Republicans being left in the\r\nundisturbed possession of the hall, perfected their organization, and\r\nthe two factions set themselves diligently to work to frame a\r\nconstitution, each claiming to be the legally constituted convention,\r\nand expecting recognition as such by the people of the State and by\r\nCongress. The debates in each were acrimonious. A few of the more\r\nmoderate delegates in each recognized the absurdity and illegality of\r\ntheir position, and questioned the propriety of remaining and\r\nparticipating in proceedings which they could not sanction.\r\n\r\nThe conventions continued their sessions inharmoniously enough. Each\r\nframed a constitution, at the completion of which a joint committee\r\nwas appointed to revise and harmonize the two constitutions, but the\r\nmembers of the committees were as belligerent as the conventions they\r\nrepresented. Members grew angry, abusing each other with words and\r\neven blows, blood being drawn in an argument with bludgeons between\r\nHon. Willis A. Gorman, Democratic, and Hon. Thomas Wilson, Republican.\r\nAn agreement seemed impossible, when some one whose name has not found\r\nits way into history, made the happy suggestion that alternate\r\narticles of each constitution be adopted. When this was done, and the\r\njoint production of the two conventions was in presentable shape,\r\nanother and almost fatal difficulty arose, as to which wing should be\r\naccorded the honor of signing officially this remarkable document. One\r\nbody or the other must acknowledge the paternity of the hybrid.\r\nIngenuity amounting to genius (it is a pity that the possessor should\r\nbe unknown) found a new expedient, namely, to write out two\r\nconstitutions in full, exact duplicates except as to signatures, the\r\none to be signed by Democratic officers and members, and the other by\r\nRepublicans These two constitutions were filed in the archives of the\r\nState and one of them, which one will probably never be known, was\r\nadopted by the people Oct. 13, 1857.\r\n\r\nThe question arises in the writer's mind as to the legality of the\r\nconstitution of Minnesota. Have we a constitution? If so, which one?\r\nThe question of legality, however, has never been raised before the\r\nproper tribunals, and it is perhaps well to leave it thus\r\nunquestioned.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST MINNESOTA STATE LEGISLATURE, HELD 1857-8.\r\n\r\nUnder a provision of the constitution adopted Oct. 13, 1857, the\r\nlegislature was elected and convened December 2d of that year,\r\nalthough the State had not then been admitted to the Union, and Gen.\r\nSam Medary was still recognized as governor, though not at the time in\r\nthe Territory, and acting through his private secretary. The whole\r\nstate, judicial and legislative ticket had been elected in October,\r\nbut none of the state officers could qualify prior to the formal\r\nadmission of the State. The legality of their proceedings was called\r\nin question. The Republicans entered a protest against legislation\r\nuntil after the admission of the State, but the Democratic party was\r\nin the majority, and territorial Democratic officers governed the\r\nlegislature, and the protest was unheeded. Notwithstanding the\r\ndoubtful validity of acts passed by this body, some bold and\r\nextravagant measures were proposed and passed, among them the famous\r\n$5,000,000 loan bill, authorizing the issue of bonds to that amount,\r\nostensibly to aid in the construction of railroads in Minnesota, and\r\nto be used as a basis for banking. This bill was passed near the close\r\nof the session, which lasted ninety days, and was an amendment to the\r\nconstitution to be voted on April 15, 1858.[J] The result proved even\r\nworse than had been predicted by the most ardent opposers of the bill,\r\nand although adopted by an overwhelming majority, speedily fulfilled\r\nthe predictions of its opponents. The State was flooded with worthless\r\nbank issues, based upon these worthless bonds. Financial distress and\r\npanic ensued. A reaction followed, and in November, 1860, the\r\namendment to the constitution was expunged. Of these bonds, $2,275,000\r\nhad already been issued, when the section granting their issue was\r\nrepealed. These the State subsequently redeemed.\r\n\r\nThis bill, though afterward adopted as an amendment to the\r\nconstitution by an overwhelming majority, was opposed most vigorously\r\nin both houses of the legislature, and characterized at the time as\r\nmischievous and infamous. Though not present at the time of its\r\npassage, on account of sickness, the author fully committed himself as\r\nan opponent of the bill, and placed himself on record in an address to\r\nhis constituents dated March 19th, at the senate chamber, which\r\naddress was circulated extensively at the time. The views and\r\npredictions therein expressed as to the disastrous character of the\r\nbill have been amply justified and verified by subsequent events.\r\n\r\nHon. Chas. F. Lowe, when a member of the Republican wing of the\r\nconstitutional convention, had designed and prepared a seal to be used\r\nby the incoming state government. It was adopted by that wing of the\r\nconvention, and Mr. Lowe hoped to have it formally adopted by the\r\nfirst state legislature. At the request of Mr. Lowe, it was presented\r\nby the writer, then a member of the senate, and was adopted by the\r\nsenate and house with many encomiums upon its beauty and\r\nappropriateness. The design was indeed a beautiful one, and the\r\nworkmanship of the seal, by Buechner, of St. Paul, was admirable. The\r\ndesign of the seal was as follows:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STATE SEAL.]\r\n\r\nA waterfall (supposed to be that of Minnehaha) within a shield; this\r\npart of the device was intended to symbolize the idea of water for the\r\namount and varied forms of which Minnesota is distinguished above any\r\nother part of our country. In addition was represented the figure of\r\nan Indian pointing toward the setting sun, as his course of destiny\r\nruns, with his tomahawk, bow and arrows; at his feet opposite the\r\nIndian was the figure of a white man, with a sheaf of wheat and the\r\nimplements of agriculture at his feet, representing to the Indian that\r\nhe must partake of the habits of civilized life or depart toward the\r\nsetting sun. In one corner of the field appeared a distant view of\r\nLake Superior, with a ship in sail. In another was a view of a river,\r\nindicating the Minnesota river, running from the westward, with a\r\nsteamboat ascending its stream. In rear of the shield and waterfall\r\nwere three trees, which are typical of the three timbered regions, the\r\noak on the left typifying the south and southwest portion of the\r\nState, the pine in the centre typifying the great pine regions of Lake\r\nSuperior, Upper Mississippi and St. Croix, and the maple on the right\r\ntypifying the north and northwestern portion of the State. For a motto\r\nto accompany the words state of Minnesota, A. D. 1858, which were\r\nplaced upon the upper rim of the seal, the words placed upon the lower\r\nrim of the seal were, \"Liberty and Union, Now and Forever One and\r\nInseparable.\" The act of the legislature went to the governor, who\r\nreturned it to the senate approved and signed, July 14, 1858.\r\n\r\nSome length of time elapsed before the appearance of the great seal as\r\nappended to official documents, and when it did appear it was very\r\ndifferent from the one adopted, and the credit of the design was given\r\nto Rev. E. D. Neill by the newspapers commenting upon it. However\r\nbeautiful and appropriate the design of the present great seal of the\r\nstate of Minnesota, there seems to be no evidence that it was ever\r\nlegally adopted, and the question may well be raised as to its\r\nvalidity. It lies, however, in the eternal fitness of things that a\r\nstate without a legal constitution should also be without a seal.\r\n\r\nAt the joint convention of Dec. 19, 1857, Hon. Henry M. Rice and Gen.\r\nJames Shields, of Mexican War fame, were elected senators. The\r\nRepublicans supported David Cooper and Henry D. Huff. During this\r\nsession the presiding officer of the senate was Richard G. Murphy, a\r\nsomewhat eccentric character. His decisions were often diverting. When\r\nperplexing questions arose he would say gravely, \"The chair can not\r\ndecide more than two questions at oncet.\" After passing many really\r\nimportant measures, the legislature adjourned March 25, to meet June\r\n2, 1858.\r\n\r\n\r\nADJOURNED SESSION.\r\n\r\nThe legislature met, pursuant to adjournment, June 2d, the State\r\nhaving been admitted in the interim. Lieut. Gov. Holcombe presided\r\nover the senate and proved an acceptable and able presiding officer.\r\nThe five million amendment having been approved by the people, this\r\nlegislature passed a banking law, establishing banks in various parts\r\nof the State with the five million bonds as a basis.\r\n\r\nIt can do no good at this late day to raise a question as to the\r\nvalidity of the acts of the first state legislature, but it is due to\r\nourselves and others who with us at the time protested against the\r\nvalidity of acts passed at this session, to give a few extracts from\r\nsenate and house journals tending to show that a feeling of distrust\r\nwas quite general. The ground of this opinion was the fact that the\r\nlegislature elected as a state legislature held its first session\r\nprior to the admission of the State, and under the administration of\r\nthe territorial governor, Medary, through his secretary, acting in his\r\nplace. The question was openly discussed, not only in the legislature\r\nbut in the public press of the State.\r\n\r\nAs early as Dec. 8, 1887, the following protest was presented in the\r\nsenate:\r\n\r\n\r\nSENATE CHAMBER, ST. PAUL.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned senators of the state of Minnesota, do hereby\r\nenter and record this, our _solemn_ PROTEST, against the recognition\r\nby this body, in any manner, directly or indirectly, of Samuel Medary,\r\nEsquire, governor of the territory of Minnesota, as the governor of\r\nthe state of Minnesota, or as being invested with any of the rights,\r\nauthority, privileges, powers or functions of governor of said state\r\nof Minnesota.\r\n\r\nAnd we do _solemnly_ PROTEST against the recognition by this body, in\r\nany manner, of the claims of the said Samuel Medary, to exercise any\r\nof the rights, authority, privileges, powers or functions of the\r\ngovernor of the state of Minnesota--such claim being wholly\r\nunauthorized and unwarranted by the constitution of the state of\r\nMinnesota; and in violation of the expressed will of the people of the\r\nstate of Minnesota, and an attempted usurpation of office, at war with\r\nthe fundamental principles of free government, and dangerous to the\r\nliberties of the people.\r\n\r\n    D. G. NORTON,\r\n    LEWIS MCKUNE>,\r\n    GEO. WATSON,\r\n    EDWIN M. SOMERS,\r\n    BOYD PHELPS,\r\n    J. K. REINER,\r\n    H. L. THOMAS,\r\n    JAMES RIDPATH,\r\n    MICHAEL COOK,\r\n    CHARLES H. LINDSLEY,\r\n    E. N. BATES,\r\n    E. HODGES,\r\n    A. G. HUDSON,\r\n    JONATHAN CHASE,\r\n    W. H. C. FOLSOM,\r\n    S. S. BEMAN,\r\n    DELANO T. SMITH.\r\n\r\nOn December 8th Mr. Norton offered the following resolution to the\r\nsenate:\r\n\r\n\"WHEREAS, By the provisions of the constitution the executive officers\r\nof the State can not qualify until after the admission of the State by\r\nCongress, and\r\n\r\n\"WHEREAS, There is no governor of the state of Minnesota to whom acts\r\nmay be submitted, as required by the constitution; therefore,\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That this legislature can pass no acts which could become\r\na law until after the admission of the State by Congress, and the\r\nqualification of the governor elected by the people.\"\r\n\r\nThe resolution was adopted and referred to the following committee:\r\nVan Etten, Streeter, Jones, Norton, and Folsom.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the select committee reported December 21st, claiming\r\nthat by the enabling act the people of the Territory were empowered to\r\nform a state government, which they did, electing their delegates on\r\nthe second Monday in July, 1857, to form a state constitution, and\r\ntake necessary steps for establishment of a state government; that\r\nthese delegates met at the time and place appointed, and on the\r\ntwenty-ninth of August adopted a constitution which was submitted to\r\nthe people and adopted by a majority of over 28,000 votes. That on the\r\nthirteenth of October, in conformity with an article (section 16,\r\narticle 16) of the constitution then adopted, the people had elected\r\nrepresentatives to Congress, governor and lieutenant governor, judges\r\nand members of both houses of the legislature, the latter to meet on\r\nthe first Wednesday in December at St. Paul.\r\n\r\nThe majority admitted that the governor elected under the act could\r\nnot qualify until after the admission of the State, but claimed that\r\nthe members of the legislature did not rest under the same disability,\r\nbut were competent to legislate because they derived their power from\r\nthe constitution itself, and had been directed to meet for that\r\npurpose on the first Monday in December, and that because they were\r\nthus required to meet they were authorized to act. The people were\r\nomnipotent in the premises. They had declared that the governor should\r\nnot qualify until after the admission of the State, and that the\r\nmembers of the legislature should meet. It was absurd to suppose this\r\nbody should be called together and have no power to act. They held,\r\nmoreover, that the territorial governor was empowered to act until his\r\nsuccessor could legally qualify; that the framers of the constitution\r\nof Minnesota and the people had declared that he should be continued\r\nin office until superseded by a state officer, and that the very time\r\nhad been specified when he should be thus superseded, namely, on the\r\nadmission of the State into the Union, and therefore that Samuel\r\nMedary was, _de facto_ and _de jure_, governor of Minnesota; that\r\nMinnesota was then a state _out_ of the Union, and that the acts of\r\nthe first legislature would be legalized when the State was admitted.\r\n\r\nThe minority report, signed by D. S. Norton and W. H. C. Folsom,\r\nclaimed that the constitution contemplated an admission into the Union\r\nas a prerequisite to the exercise of state sovereignty, in article 5,\r\nsection 7, where it is enacted that \"the term of each of the executive\r\nofficers named in this article shall commence upon taking the oath of\r\noffice, _after the State shall be admitted by Congress into the Union,\r\netc._\"\r\n\r\nSection 9, same article, provides that \"Laws shall be passed at the\r\nfirst session of the legislature _after the State is admitted into the\r\nUnion_ to carry out the provisions of this article.\r\n\r\n\"Section 1, article 16, _schedule_, provides that all process which\r\nmay be issued under the authority of the territory of Minnesota\r\nprevious to its _admission into the Union of the United States_, shall\r\nbe as valid as if issued in the name of the State.\"\r\n\r\nSection 8, same article, provides that if the constitution shall be\r\nadopted by a vote of the people, the governor of the Territory shall\r\nforward a certified copy of the same to the president of the United\r\nStates, \"_to be by him laid before the Congress of the United\r\nStates_.\"\r\n\r\nThe minority claimed that under the first of the above cited sections\r\nthere can be no qualified governor (_elected under, and according to\r\nthe provisions of the constitution_) to whom \"bills\" _must_ be\r\nsubmitted before they can become laws, until _after_ \"admission\"--nor\r\nindeed can there be _any_ executive officers, contemplated to perform\r\nthe duties of their several offices, until that time.\r\n\r\nIn reference to the provisions of section 18, article 16, _schedule_,\r\nas inconsistent with that view, it was claimed that the territorial\r\ngovernment should continue, and that its officers should exercise the\r\nsovereign powers delegated to them by the Union, until, upon an\r\nadmission by Congress, and a surrender of sovereignty to the State,\r\nits authority should commence.\r\n\r\nIt was claimed that this section (6) of article 16, requiring the\r\nlegislature to convene on the first Wednesday of December, 1857, was\r\nan oversight or error. After considerable debate the majority report\r\nwas adopted by a party vote. A similar protest, signed by all the\r\nRepublican members of the house, was presented to that body. In\r\naddition to these protests there was in both branches of the\r\nlegislature continuous and various protests by the minority against\r\nthe exercise of legislative functions.\r\n\r\nIn the house, on Jan. 25, 1858, Mr. Sheetz offered a resolution with\r\nreference to the causes of the delay in the admission of Minnesota,\r\nasking that a committee of three be appointed with instructions to\r\ninvestigate the circumstances of this delay and report to this house\r\nupon these points:\r\n\r\n_First_--As to whose duty it was to forward to the president for\r\nsubmission to Congress a copy of the constitution.\r\n\r\n_Second_--Why an incorrect or incomplete copy of said constitution was\r\nforwarded to the president.\r\n\r\n_Third_--What official correspondence, if any, has passed between the\r\ngovernor and the acting governor in regard to this matter.\r\n\r\nOn motion the resolution was adopted.\r\n\r\nMr. Sheetz, from the committee appointed to communicate with the\r\nacting governor relative to the admission of the state of Minnesota,\r\nsubmitted the following report:\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Honorable House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nYour committee appointed to inquire into the causes of the probable\r\ndelay in the admission of Minnesota into the Union, ask leave to make\r\nthe following report:\r\n\r\nYour committee find that according to section 8 of the schedule to the\r\nconstitution, it is made the duty of the governor of the Territory,\r\nupon the adoption of the constitution by the people, to forward a\r\ncertified copy of the constitution to the president of the United\r\nStates, to be by him submitted to Congress.\r\n\r\nYour committee have conferred with his excellency, Acting Gov. Chase,\r\nand have ascertained from him that at or about the time of the\r\nadjournment of the constitutional conventions, there were deposited\r\nwith him, as acting governor in the absence of Gov. Medary, two copies\r\nof the constitution as adopted by the two branches of the\r\nconstitutional convention, one copy signed by _fifty-one_ members of\r\nthe Democratic branch of the convention, and the other signed by\r\n_fifty-three_ members of the Republican branch of the convention, that\r\nthe two copies were preserved by him in the same safe, side by side\r\nwhere they now are.\r\n\r\nYour committee are further informed that a short time prior to the\r\ndeparture of our senators and representatives elect for Washington,\r\nthe governor caused to be made a transcript of the constitution as\r\nrequested by the schedule and that instrument, which transcript was\r\nforwarded to the president of the United States.\r\n\r\nNo record is known to your committee to exist of the time and manner\r\nof making such transcript, and your committee, in the absence of the\r\ngovernor and his private secretary, can not ascertain whether said\r\ntranscript contained the names of the members of the two branches of\r\nthe constitutional convention or not.\r\n\r\nYour committee are also informed by Acting Gov. Chase that there has\r\nbeen no official correspondence between the governor and himself upon\r\nthis subject since the departure of the former for Washington.\r\n\r\nAll of which is respectfully submitted and signed.\r\n\r\n                        H. W. SHEETZ,\r\n                        G. L. OTIS,\r\n                        J. J. CRUTTENDEN,\r\n                        _Committee_.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAND GRANTS, RAILROAD SURVEYS AND CONSTRUCTION.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1857, Congress gave to Minnesota, then a territory, a\r\nmagnificent grant of about 9,000,000 acres of land, to aid in the\r\nconstruction of several projected trunk roads through her bounds. The\r\nroads specified were: From Stillwater, by way of St. Paul and St.\r\nAnthony Falls, to a point between the foot of Big Stone lake and the\r\nmouth of the Sioux Wood river, with a branch via St. Cloud and Crow\r\nWing to the navigable waters of the Red River of the North; from St.\r\nPaul and St. Anthony via Minneapolis to a convenient point of junction\r\nwest of the Mississippi to the southern boundary of the Territory in\r\nthe direction of the mouth of the Big Sioux river, with a branch via\r\nFaribault to the north line of the state of Iowa, west of range 16;\r\nfrom Winona to a point on the Big Sioux river south of the forty-fifth\r\nparallel of north latitude; also from La Crescent via Target lake, up\r\nthe valley of Root river, to a point of junction with the last\r\nmentioned road, east of range 17, every alternate section of land\r\ndesignated by odd numbers, for six sections in width on each side of\r\nsaid road and branches. It was enacted that the lands granted were to\r\nbe subject to the disposal of the legislature.\r\n\r\nAn extra session of the legislature was convened in June, 1857, to\r\naccept the grant and devise means to build the road.\r\n\r\nThe financial crisis of 1857 and unwise legislation in 1858, notably\r\nthe attempt to issue $5,000,000 in bonds to aid in building the roads,\r\nserved to delay the various enterprises projected, and for many years\r\nbut little work was done, notwithstanding persistent effort at every\r\nstate legislature to effect favorable changes in the condition of\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nA few of the $5,000,000 bonds were issued, but the general\r\ndissatisfaction, and feeling that they were not issued on a legal or\r\nrational basis, depreciated their value, and they were sold at a\r\nsacrifice and afterward redeemed by the State.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NORTHERN PACIFIC RAILROAD.\r\n\r\nThe idea of a railroad from the Atlantic to the Pacific was openly\r\ndiscussed as early as 1837, in which year Dr. Hartwell Carver\r\nmemorialized Congress on the subject and promulgated his views through\r\nthe press and by pamphlets. In 1845 Asa Whitney evolved a plan for\r\nthe northern route, and awakened considerable popular enthusiasm, but\r\nby many the project was considered as a swindling scheme, or at best a\r\nvisionary enterprise. Mr. Whitney made a preliminary survey from\r\nPrairie du Chien as far as the Rocky mountains. Mr. Josiah Perham,\r\nafterward the first president of the Northern Pacific Railroad\r\nCompany, in 1857 projected a road from Maine to Puget Sound, to be\r\nknown as the People's Pacific Railway, and obtained a charter from the\r\nMaine legislature, but on bringing his scheme to the attention of\r\nCongress was prevailed upon by Thaddeus Stevens to abandon this scheme\r\nfor another, agreeing to aid him in the passage of a bill for the\r\nconstruction of the present Northern Pacific route. The bill passed\r\nboth houses and was signed by President Lincoln, July 2, 1864. The\r\nfirst permanent officers were: Josiah Perham, president; Willard Sear,\r\nvice president; Abiel Abbott, secretary; J. S. Withington, treasurer.\r\n\r\nThe grants of land voted by Congress were accepted, and in the\r\nfollowing year the states of Wisconsin and Minnesota granted right of\r\nway. Not much was done until 1869, when Jay Cooke & Co. became\r\nfinancially interested in the road, and might have been successful in\r\nplacing the bonds of the road upon the eastern markets but for the\r\nEuropean war, during which time the firm of Jay Cooke & Co. went down\r\noverburdened with railroad securities. The financial panic of 1873\r\nwhich followed found the company in possession of 555 miles of\r\ncompleted railroad, of which 450 reached from Duluth to Bismarck, and\r\n105 from Klamath to Tacoma on Puget Sound; but embarrassed by want of\r\nfunds the enterprise made but little headway, and in 1875 Henry\r\nVillard was appointed receiver, and a decree of sale obtained by which\r\nthe bondholders were enabled to become the preferred stockholders.\r\nUnder the new arrangement and by the powerful aid of Henry Villard and\r\nThomas F. Oakes, the public, and especially the capitalists of the\r\ncountry, regained faith in the enterprise, and the work was pushed\r\nsteadily forward until September, 1883, when the golden spike was\r\ndriven at Gold Creek by Henry Villard. Mr. Villard resigned the\r\npresidency of the road in December of the same year, and Robert Harris\r\nsucceeded him. The main line of this road extends from Duluth to\r\nTacoma, a distance of nearly 2,000 miles, and the number of miles on\r\nthe main and branch lines aggregates 3,395.\r\n\r\nThe magnitude of the work, the leagues of wilderness to be traversed,\r\nthe mountain ranges to be crossed, the streams to be bridged, the\r\nsupposed obstructions from wintry storms to be overcome, all these\r\nwere of such a nature as to make the project seem impossible. It was,\r\nnevertheless, through the liberality of the government and the\r\nenthusiasm and executive ability of its managers, accomplished in a\r\ncomparatively short time.\r\n\r\nThe government contributed to this road a land grant of forty sections\r\nto the mile. With this liberal basis, bonds for the required amount of\r\nmoney were speedily furnished to build and equip the road from Lake\r\nSuperior to the Pacific coast. This road has, however, the advantage\r\nof southern roads, in that it traverses a rich agricultural and\r\nmineral region throughout almost its entire extent, passing through\r\nbelts of timbered land not excelled in the quantity and quality of\r\ntheir production. The mineral regions are rich in gold, silver,\r\ncopper, lead and coal.\r\n\r\nThe country along the road is being rapidly settled, and the property\r\nin its possession, and that of those who have made improvements along\r\nits line, has increased to many hundred times its original value.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHICAGO, ST. PAUL, MINNEAPOLIS & OMAHA RAILROAD.\r\n\r\nThe Wisconsin legislature in 1854 chartered a company to construct and\r\noperate this road, then called the St. Croix, Superior & Bayfield\r\nrailroad. May 3, 1856, Congress granted twelve sections of land to the\r\nmile to aid in building a railroad from Hudson in the St. Croix valley\r\nto Bayfield on Lake Superior, with a branch to Superior City. July 5,\r\n1864, this grant was increased to twenty sections per mile, with\r\nindemnity lands to make up deficiencies. These lands were ceded\r\ndirectly to the State. A company was created by the state legislature\r\nof Wisconsin, to which were consigned the lands and franchises granted\r\nby the government for the purpose of building the road. The lands and\r\nfranchises passed through several organized companies. Impediments to\r\nconstruction arising, extension of time was asked and obtained from\r\nthe United States and Wisconsin governments, complications arose,\r\ndelaying the construction still further, other companies claimed part\r\nof the indemnity lands, and litigation ensued. The state legislature\r\nupheld the chartered right, and appointed agents to watch the timber\r\nand protect the interests of the company. A sum amounting to $200,000\r\nwas collected from trespassers and at once applied to the building of\r\nthe roads in 1879.\r\n\r\nThe St. Paul, Stillwater & Taylor's Falls Company in 1872 had built a\r\nline of railroad from Hudson to New Richmond. In 1874 the St. Croix,\r\nSuperior & Bayfield Company obtained possession of this line of road\r\nand continued it in the direction of Superior, completing it in 1883\r\nto Superior City, Bayfield, Washburn, and Ashland. The company have\r\nbuilt a road from Hudson by River Falls to Ellsworth in Pierce county.\r\nThe main line to Lake Superior passes through a rich agricultural and\r\nimmense pine region. The company have constructed at Washburn, on\r\nChequamegon bay, extensive docks, elevators, warehouses and shops.\r\nThere are on the main line 20 wooden bridges from 25 to 100 feet long,\r\n10 from 100 to 300 feet, 10 from 300 to 500 feet, one of them on a\r\nbranch of White river being 90 feet high. The amount of logs and\r\nlumber carried over this road amounts (1888) to 1,240,000,000 feet,\r\nand 1,500,000,000 feet remain. There are few trips more enjoyable to\r\nthe tourist than the one over this road, terminating as it does on the\r\nnorth, in a region attractive for its beautiful scenery, including the\r\nlovely bays of Ashland, Washburn and Bayfield, with their picturesque\r\nshores, hills green with spruce pine and balsam, and the Apostle\r\nislands, favorite haunts of summer travelers. The road is splendidly\r\nequipped and well officered.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ST. PAUL & DULUTH RAILROAD (FORMERLY KNOWN AS THE LAKE SUPERIOR &\r\nMISSISSIPPI).\r\n\r\nThe first land grant for Minnesota was made in 1854, for a road from\r\nSt. Paul to Lake Superior. This bill gave twenty sections per mile to\r\nthe company building. While the bill was in the hands of the enrolling\r\ncommittee, some fraudulent changes were made in its provisions, as a\r\nconsequence of which, after it had passed both houses and was in the\r\nhands of the president, it was recalled by the house of\r\nrepresentatives, which had originated it, the fraudulent passages were\r\npointed out, and the further consideration of the bill was\r\nindefinitely postponed.\r\n\r\nRailroad enterprise received a check from which it did not recover in\r\nmany years. May 5, 1864, Congress gave ten alternate sections on each\r\nside of lands to aid in building the Lake Superior & Mississippi\r\nrailroad. This grant was increased to twenty sections per mile, and\r\nindemnity lands were given. The state of Minnesota has also given\r\nseven sections of swamp land per mile. The city of St. Paul also gave\r\na bonus of $250,000 in city bonds, to run twenty years, and St. Louis\r\ncounty gave $150,000 in bonds for a like period. From the proceeds of\r\nthese lands and bonds an excellent thoroughfare has been built and\r\nmaintained. The franchises pertaining to this road changed holders\r\nmany times before the road was completed.\r\n\r\nThe original incorporators were mostly citizens of Philadelphia who,\r\nunder the name and title of the \"Nebraska & Lake Superior Company,\"\r\nobtained their charter from the territorial legislature May 25, 1857.\r\nTheir chartered rights were amended and their name changed to that of\r\n\"Lake Superior & Mississippi Railroad Company.\" The times for building\r\nwere extended by Congress and the state legislature from time to time,\r\nas asked for by the company. The road was commenced in 1867 and\r\ncompleted to Duluth in 1870, and the name changed to \"St. Paul &\r\nDuluth\" in 1875. The first cost of building was $7,700,000. The\r\ncompany have in addition built branch roads from White Bear to\r\nMinneapolis, from White Bear to Stillwater, from Wyoming to Taylor's\r\nFalls, from Rush City to Grantsburg, from North Pacific Junction to\r\nCloquet, and a branch in Pine county to Sandstone City. The Taylor's\r\nFalls & Lake Superior branch road received seven sections per mile of\r\nswamp lands from the State, $10,000 in ten per cent bonds from the\r\ntown of Chisago Lake, $5,000 from the town of Shafer, and $18,600 from\r\nthe town of Taylor's Falls.\r\n\r\nPresidents of the St. Paul & Duluth railroad: Lyman Dayton, W. L.\r\nBanning, Frank Clark, John P. Illsley, H. H. Porter, James Smith, Jr.,\r\nand Wm. H. Fisher.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINNESOTA & MANITOBA RAILROAD.\r\n\r\nUnder the land grant of 1857 a road was projected between St. Paul and\r\nSt. Anthony Falls, and completed in 1862, the first railroad in\r\nMinnesota, though others had been projected at an earlier period. This\r\nroad was afterward extended to Breckenridge on Red river, and branches\r\nwere built to St. Cloud, and from St. Cloud via Fergus Falls and\r\nCrookston to the national boundary at St. Vincent, and from\r\nBrekenridge through Dakota to the Great Falls in Montana. Subordinate\r\nbranches to various points in Northern Minnesota, Dakota and Montana\r\nwere also built. The roads from Minneapolis to St. Cloud and\r\nBreckenridge were built with German capital.\r\n\r\nAfter the completion of the main lines a financial depression\r\noccurred, the bonds were sold at a low figure and subsequently passed\r\ninto the hands of J. J. Hill and others. The aggregate mileage of this\r\nroad and its branches amount to 2,685 miles. It traverses a wheat\r\ngrowing region not surpassed on the continent. The present terminus,\r\nthe Great Falls of Missouri, is a mining centre for gold and silver.\r\nThe country tributary to the road can not fail to make it one of the\r\nmost important highways of commerce in the great West, and thus far\r\nthe energy and ability of its managers has made it equal to the\r\nimmense demands upon it.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTILLWATER, WHITE BEAR & ST. PAUL RAILROAD.\r\n\r\nUnder the grant of 1857, a road from Stillwater to St. Paul was\r\nprojected, the road to commence at Stillwater and to proceed via St.\r\nPaul and Minneapolis to the western boundary of the State. The company\r\nholding the grant, through legislative action effected a change in the\r\nconditions of the grant allowing them to commence at St. Paul,\r\nbuilding west and northwest, as a result of which the road from\r\nStillwater to St. Paul was not built. After ten years of inactivity\r\nupon this portion of the road, the Stillwater people demanded, through\r\ntheir representatives in the legislature of 1867, legislation\r\ncompelling the building of the road as originally devised. At this\r\nsession Hon. John McKusick, not then a member of the legislature, but\r\nstill an influential man, and representing public sentiment,\r\nimportuned the company holding the franchises, through the president,\r\nHon. Edmund Rice, either to build the road or to transfer the\r\nfranchises to some responsible company who would build it. Hon. Henry\r\nA. Jackman and the writer, members of the ninth legislature, after\r\nconference with the president of the company, introduced a bill\r\nconveying the franchises from the original company to a company of St.\r\nCroix valley men, to be organized forthwith, with the conditions that\r\nthey at once proceed to build the road from Stillwater to White Bear,\r\nconnecting with the St. Paul & Duluth at that point. A section was\r\nplaced in the bill locating the railroad lands near Kandiyohi lake.\r\nThese lands were among the most valuable in the grant and were to\r\ninure to the new company at the completion of the road. The bill was\r\npassed and approved by the governor. The road was completed to\r\nStillwater Dec. 20, 1869.\r\n\r\nThe legislature of 1869 transferred 44,246 acres, or one-half of the\r\nKandiyohi lands, to the St. Paul, Stillwater & Taylor's Falls\r\nrailroad.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ST. PAUL, STILLWATER & TAYLOR'S FALLS RAILROAD.\r\n\r\nPart of the lands originally granted to the Stillwater, White Bear &\r\nSt. Paul railroad were transferred by the legislature of 1869 to the\r\nSt. Paul, Stillwater & Taylor's Falls railroad. The proceeds of the\r\nsale were to be applied to the construction of the above named road.\r\nThe company was organized under the general laws of the State and\r\nincorporated Sept. 23, 1869. The route of the road defined in the\r\narticles of incorporation is between St. Paul and Taylor's Falls by\r\nway of Stillwater, passing through or near Marine, with a branch road\r\nto Hudson, Wisconsin. Length of main line from St. Paul to Stillwater\r\nis seventeen and fifty-four one hundredths miles. Hudson branch line\r\nfrom Stillwater junction to Lake St. Croix, three and one-fourth.\r\nSouth Stillwater branch line from Stillwater to South Stillwater,\r\nthree miles. The first train by this line reached Stillwater from St.\r\nPaul Feb. 9, 1872. The capital stock, $1,000,000, may be increased at\r\npleasure. The number of shares of capital stock is 10,000 of $100\r\neach, limit of indebtedness, $1,500,000.\r\n\r\nThat part of the road to be built from Stillwater to Taylor's Falls up\r\nto the present date has not been completed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WISCONSIN CENTRAL (BRANCH) RAILROAD.\r\n\r\nIn 1884 the Wisconsin Central built a branch road from Chippewa Falls\r\nvia New Richmond to St. Paul, passing into Ramsey county east and\r\nsouth of White Bear. The bridge over the St. Croix river about four\r\nmiles above Stillwater, belonging to this road, is a fine piece of\r\nworkmanship, built entirely of iron and resting on solid stone piers.\r\nThe total length of the structure is 2,400 feet, there being ten\r\nspans, each 160 feet long, and a viaduct, 800 feet long, on the\r\nWisconsin side.\r\n\r\nThe track is 87 feet above low water mark. The entire cost of the\r\nbridge was about $197,000. It was damaged by a cyclone in 1885 to the\r\namount of $10,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nTAYLOR'S FALLS & LAKE SUPERIOR RAILROAD.\r\n\r\nThe franchises and swamp land grant of the Lake Superior & Mississippi\r\nrailroad pertaining to the Taylor's Falls branch were in 1875, by\r\nlegislative enactment, transferred to the Taylor's Falls & Lake\r\nSuperior Company. In 1879 these franchises and lands were transferred\r\nto the Minneapolis & St. Louis Railroad Company. In the fall of 1879\r\nthe St. Paul & Duluth Company built a branch road to Centre City. In\r\nthe spring of 1880 the Minneapolis & St. Louis Company built three\r\nmiles of road southward from Taylor's Falls, accomplishing in that\r\ndistance as difficult and expensive work of its kind as had been done\r\nin the State, the grading being made through the trap rock ledges of\r\nthe Dalles, and along the face of the nearly perpendicular bluffs\r\noverlooking the river. In the summer of 1880 they transferred their\r\nfranchises and one-half their swamp land grant to the St. Paul &\r\nDuluth Company, by whom the road was completed from Centre City to the\r\nroad already built at Taylor's Falls, Oct. 29, 1880.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHICAGO, MILWAUKEE & ST. PAUL RAILROAD--RIVER DIVISION.\r\n\r\nThe river division of this road follows the west bank of the river\r\nfrom Dubuque to Hastings, passing through all the river towns.\r\nCrossing the river at Hastings it passes through the towns of Newport,\r\nCottage Grove and Denmark, and the cities of St. Paul and Minneapolis,\r\nterminal stations. The line from St. Paul to Hastings was built in\r\n1869, by the Chicago & St. Paul Railway Company, under charter granted\r\nto the Minnesota & Pacific Railroad Company in 1857. The present\r\nmanagement obtained control of the line in 1872. The bridge across the\r\nMississippi at Hastings was constructed in 1878, and was the first\r\niron railroad bridge in the State. In respect to cost and workmanship\r\nit ranked with the important structures of the Northwest. The total\r\nlength of the river bridge is 706 feet, and consists of an iron draw\r\nspan 300 feet long, two fixed spans each of 150 feet in length, and a\r\ncombination span on the north shore 106 feet in length. The cost of\r\nthe structure was $200,000. In 1884 a branch line was extended from\r\nPoint Douglas to Stillwater.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINNEAPOLIS, SAULT STE. MARIE & ATLANTIC.\r\n\r\nThe following memorial, introduced by the writer while a member of the\r\nstate senate of 1877, is the first public mention or suggestion of\r\nthis road as far as we are aware. It was adopted by the legislature,\r\nforwarded to Washington, read and duly referred to the committee on\r\nrailroads:\r\n\r\n    STATE OF MINNESOTA.\r\n    NINETEENTH SESSION.   S.F.   NO. 36.\r\n\r\n    A MEMORIAL\r\n      _Introduced by Mr. Folsom, Jan. 12, 1877._ TO CONGRESS FOR\r\n    RIGHT OF WAY AND GRANT OF LAND FOR RAILROAD PURPOSES.\r\n\r\n    _To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\n    States in Congress assembled:_\r\n\r\nYour memorialists, the legislature of the state of Minnesota,\r\nrespectfully represent that the rapidly increasing settlements of the\r\nNorthwest, the surplus agricultural products and material developments\r\ndemand greater and cheaper facilities than now existing, and a more\r\ndirect transit to the Atlantic seaboard and European ports, and\r\neastern products transported to the Northwest.\r\n\r\nThat the saving in the distance to eastern markets of three hundred\r\nmiles, by a railroad route from St. Paul and Minneapolis to Sault Ste.\r\nMarie, will tend to more fully develop the great wheat growing region\r\nof Wisconsin, Minnesota, Dakota, and Montana. The surplus of wheat,\r\nwhich forms one of the most reliable exports from our government, in\r\nshortening the distance to European markets three hundred miles will\r\ngive encouragement to this great source of wealth to our whole land,\r\nand deserves aid and protection.\r\n\r\nThat by reason of the facts set forth in this memorial, and many\r\nother considerations, the nearest transit makes cheap transportation\r\nand thereby develops the country and increases prosperity.\r\n\r\nTo further these objects, we ask Congress to donate land to aid, and\r\nthe right of way through government land to build, a railroad from the\r\ncities of St. Paul and Minneapolis to the falls of St. Marie's river.\r\n\r\nSept. 20, 1879, a large mass meeting was held at St. Croix Falls, the\r\nobject being to consider the feasibility of the \"Soo\" route. Over five\r\nhundred persons were present, among them delegates from Minneapolis,\r\nSt. Paul, Stillwater, and Superior City. The subject was discussed and\r\nresolutions passed favoring the building of the road to Sault Ste.\r\nMarie via the Dalles of St. Croix.\r\n\r\nNot, however, till Sept. 12, 1883, were the articles of incorporation\r\nfiled in Wisconsin and Minnesota by W. D. Washburn and others of\r\nMinneapolis, for the Minneapolis, Sault Ste. Marie & Atlantic Railroad\r\nCompany.\r\n\r\nThe road was completed to the \"Soo\" in December, 1887. At that point\r\nit connects with a branch of the Canadian Pacific. The St. Marie river\r\nis to be crossed on a union bridge built by the roads centring at that\r\npoint. It is now under construction, and will cost when completed over\r\na million dollars. The length of the line is about 225 miles. The\r\ncapital stock is $12,000,000, divided into 80,000 shares of common\r\nstock, and 40,000 shares preferred. The board of directors for the\r\nfirst year is composed of the following persons, all residents of\r\nMinneapolis: W. D. Washburn, president; H. T. Welles, John Martin,\r\nThomas Lowry, George R. Newell, Anthony Kelly, M. Loring, Clinton\r\nMorrison, J. K. Sidle, W. W. Eastman, W. D. Hale, C. A. Pillsbury, and\r\nChas. J. Martin.\r\n\r\nThe following comparison of distance will be of interest to the people\r\nof the Northwestern States:\r\n\r\n                                      MILES.

The cost complete,\r\nincluding rolling stock, was $30,000 per mile. The road was built on a\r\ngrade of nine and eight-tenths feet to the mile, and its curvature\r\nnowhere exceeds three degrees in one hundred feet. The St. Croix,\r\nChippewa, Wisconsin, Platte, Grant, and Fever rivers are crossed by\r\niron bridges.\r\n\r\n\r\nMILEAGE OF ROADS CENTRING IN ST.

CROIX\r\nRIVER.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1858, when the writer was a member of the Minnesota\r\nsenate, he introduced a memorial to Congress for the improvement of\r\nthe St. Croix river, and of the Mississippi at Beef Slough bar, below\r\nLake Pepin. This was the first memorial presented on this subject.\r\nSubsequent legislatures continued to memorialize Congress, but it was\r\ntwenty years of continuous pleading before any attention was paid to\r\nthe subject. In 1878 Thaddeus C. Pound, representing the St. Croix\r\nvalley in Congress, secured the first appropriation. Mr. Pound also\r\nsecured the first appropriation for the Mississippi reservoirs.\r\n\r\nThe following appropriations were made from time to time: 1878,\r\n$8,000; 1879, $10,000; 1880, $8,000; 1881, $10,000; 1882, $30,000;\r\n1883, $7,500.\r\n\r\nThis money has been expended under the supervision of Maj. Farquier\r\nand Charles J. Allen of the United States engineering corps, with\r\nheadquarters at St. Paul. The improvements carried out consisted in\r\nremoving snags and all impediments in the channel or along shore,\r\nremoving sandbars, thus deepening the channel, building wing dams, and\r\nriprapping the shores. The work has been well done, and the\r\nexpenditure is a most judicious one.\r\n\r\n\r\nINLAND NAVIGATION.\r\n\r\nAs the prosperity of a country depends, next to its natural resources,\r\nupon the avenues of communication with other countries, the people of\r\nthe Northwest naturally took a great interest in the improvement of\r\ntheir waterways. The states lying along the Mississippi and its\r\ntributaries found by these streams an advantageous southern outlet for\r\ntheir produce. But much needed to be done in the direction of\r\nimproving navigation by clearing away obstructions, deepening the\r\nchannels, and affording facilities for crossing rapids. As the\r\nsettlements extended toward the great lakes, it became evident that\r\nthe prosperity of the country would be greatly enhanced by\r\ncommunication with the lakes. In the absence or scarcity of navigable\r\nstreams this communication, if obtained, must be by the improvement of\r\nnavigation of the upper portion of these streams having their source\r\nnear the lakes and their connection by canals with the lakes or their\r\ntributaries. By this means it was thought a better route to the\r\nAtlantic and to the Eastern States would be afforded for grain and\r\nother products than that afforded by the Mississippi. In the Minnesota\r\nstate legislature of 1875 a bill was introduced making an\r\nappropriation of $10,000 for a survey of the route connecting the\r\nwaters of Lake Superior with those of the St. Croix. This bill met\r\nwith much opposition, but was finally passed, the amount having been\r\nreduced by amendment to $3,000. Lucas R. Stannard and Robert B. Davis\r\nwere appointed commissioners, and with the meagre amount did all that\r\nwas possible to be done in surveying the route. As the author of the\r\nbill, I insert here, as a matter of history, and as a sufficient\r\nexplanation of my own views and those of the friends of the measure, a\r\nsynopsis of the arguments presented to the senate advocating the\r\nmeasure:\r\n\r\n\"The route from Duluth via the lakes and St. Lawrence, and the\r\nAtlantic to England, according to correct computation, is about six\r\nhundred miles shorter than the route via Chicago and New York. The\r\nnorthern route is being made feasible by the improvements made by the\r\nBritish government on the Welland canal and Lachine rapids, and by the\r\nimprovements made by our own government on the St. Clair flats and the\r\nSault Ste. Marie canal, by which a depth of water is obtained\r\nsufficient to float vessels drawing twenty feet. This route to Europe\r\nwill be traversed in much less time than the New York route. Vessels\r\nwill be constructed for this inland American trade, and starting from\r\nthe west end of Lake Superior with a cargo of grain that two weeks\r\nbefore was waving in the sunlight on northwestern prairies, will pass\r\ndirect to Europe without breaking of bulk or reshipping, while the\r\nsouthern route requires reshipments at Buffalo and New York. Figures\r\ncan scarcely do justice to the vast business that will be transacted\r\non this open route as the northern part of the United States and the\r\nadjacent British possessions are settled.\r\n\r\n\"The opening of this route will tend to create new treaty stipulations\r\nand unlooked for interpretations of the old with the Dominion\r\ngovernment, and establish commercial confidence and secure trade not\r\nrealized to-day. Cheap transportation is the demand of the age, and\r\nthis route will afford to the hundreds of millions of bushels of wheat\r\nand the commerce of Central North America the desired outlet to the\r\nbest markets of the world. To many these ideas may seem chimerical,\r\nbut we believe that the progress of the country and the development of\r\nher commerce in the not distant future will justify them, and that\r\npredictions now regarded as fanciful will be fulfilled to the letter.\r\n\r\n\"Minnesota as a state is just in the age of development. She is rising\r\nto power and influence. Much depends upon our legislature, more than\r\ndepended upon the legislature of New York when, actuated by good\r\ncounsels it connected the waters of the Hudson with those of Lake\r\nErie by the 'Clinton Ditch,' so called in derision by the enemies of\r\nthe measure. But the wisdom of Dewitt Clinton, the originator of that\r\nfamous waterway, advanced the settlement of the great West at least a\r\nquarter of a century.\r\n\r\n\"Minnesota in her location holds the key that will unlock the largest\r\nbody of fresh water on the globe, and open to it one of the most\r\nfertile and extensive wheat growing districts on the continent, a\r\ncountry that will soon vie with the country around the Black sea in\r\nthe quantity and quality of its grain production.\r\n\r\n\"Shall we stand idly by whilst our neighboring states are moving to\r\nsecure cheaper communications with the seaboard states? Cheap\r\ntransportation, the lever that moves the world, is claiming the\r\nfavorable attention of Congress, and men and means have been provided\r\nto ascertain the most feasible routes on which to bestow her aid for\r\nthe transferring of the surplus products of the country to the markets\r\nof the East.\r\n\r\n\"The reports made thus far by the national committee make no allusion\r\nto Minnesota's great gateway to the East by Lake Superior, nor to the\r\nimprovement of the Sault Ste. Marie canal. The committee dwelt\r\nsomewhat elaborately upon the project of connecting the Mississippi\r\nwith the lakes by means of a canal between the waters of Wisconsin and\r\nFox rivers, neither of them good navigable streams. No authorized\r\nsurvey has ever commended this as a cheap route. Only one plan can be\r\nadopted by which a thoroughfare can be made profitable to the\r\ngovernment and to the Northwest over this route, and that is to\r\nconstruct a ship canal along the Wisconsin river from the portage to\r\nthe mouth.\r\n\r\n\"If the government can be prevailed upon to open up this route no one\r\nwill deny that it will be of incalculable benefit to the people of\r\nWisconsin, and to those further up the valley of the Mississippi. Let\r\nits friends do all they can to push forward the great movement.\r\n\r\n\"To Minnesotians I would say, let Wisconsin have much of our aid. I\r\ntrust it will not take thirty-five years of the future to open up what\r\nthirty-five years of the past has projected. Wisconsin alone and\r\nunassisted ought to have accomplished this great work years ago, if\r\nthe work could have been accomplished as cheaply as it has been\r\nrepresented.\r\n\r\n\"Let Minnesota look nearer home. The headwaters of the St. Croix are\r\nnearer to Lake Superior than those of any other navigable stream.\r\nLarge Mississippi boats, whenever occasion has demanded, have made\r\ntheir way to the Dalles of the St. Croix. The falls and rapids above\r\nthis point for a distance of four miles have a fall of but\r\nseventy-four feet, an elevation that could be overcome by means of\r\nlocks. By means of wing dams at Kettle River falls, and other\r\nimprovements at no very great cost, the river could be made navigable\r\nto the mouth of the Namakagon. This river, though put down as a\r\ntributary, is in reality the main stream, and can be navigated to\r\nNamakagon lake, which is but thirty miles from Ashland, and can be\r\nconnected by a canal with Chequamegon bay, or with White river, a\r\ndistance of only a few miles.\r\n\r\n\"If we pass up the St. Croix from the mouth of the Namakagon river, we\r\nshall find no serious obstructions to navigation till we reach the\r\ngreat dam built by the lumbermen twenty miles below Upper Lake St.\r\nCroix. The conformation here is of such a character that an\r\ninexhaustible supply of water can be held--more than three times what\r\nis held in the celebrated Summit lake in Ohio, which feeds the canal\r\nconnecting the waters of the Ohio and Lake Erie. It is but a mile from\r\nthe former lake to the source of Brule river, an affluent of Lake\r\nSuperior, but as the waters of the Brule are rapid and the channel\r\nrocky, and its outlet is on a bleak and unhospitable stretch of lake\r\nshore, destitute of any harbor, we prefer the route from the Upper St.\r\nCroix lake to the bay of Superior, a distance of about thirty miles, a\r\nroute well supplied by reservoirs of water, and with no difficult or\r\ninsurmountable hills to overcome.\r\n\r\n\"Hon. H. M. Rice, who was one of the commissioners to survey the St.\r\nMarie's canal, pronounces this the most feasible and direct route for\r\nour contemplated canal.\r\n\r\n\"Other routes have been proposed, as from the St. Croix to the Nemadji\r\nand St. Louis rivers, but of the feasibility of these I am not so\r\ndefinitely informed.\r\n\r\n\"Believing, gentlemen of the senate, that you are in full accord with\r\nme that this great Northwest demands not only state aid in developing\r\nour natural resources, but the assistance of the general government, I\r\nrecommend the proper presentation of this subject before Congress by\r\nour senators and representatives until our prayers are granted for\r\nthe improvement of the same.\"\r\n\r\nIn the session of the Minnesota legislature of 1876 I again introduced\r\na memorial to Congress asking for an appropriation of $10,000 to make\r\na government survey of the St. Croix and Lake Superior routes.\r\n\r\nGeorge R. Stuntz, the veteran explorer, surveyor and civil engineer,\r\nwho accompanied the United States reservoir commission to the Upper\r\nSt. Croix waters, and who had made previous scientific examinations\r\nfor the purpose of forming a correct idea of the contour of the summit\r\ndividing the waters flowing north and south, and of the practicability\r\nof constructing reservoirs, and of the cost of connecting the Lake\r\nSuperior and St. Croix waters, makes the following report, which is\r\nvaluable for the reliable data given:\r\n\r\n\"There are evidences that in the glacial period this was the channel\r\nthrough which flowed a river of ice, and that subsequently for a long\r\nperiod a vast volume of water coursed through this channel from Lake\r\nSuperior to and down the Mississippi. The valley is everywhere of\r\ngreat width in proportion to the present volume of water, showing\r\nevidences of currents of great velocity fifty feet above the high\r\nwater marks of the present time. These ancient banks of the river are\r\ncomposed of heavy drift gravel and boulders bearing the marks of the\r\nglacial action and having their origin north of Lake Superior. This\r\nvalley extends across the height of land in township 45, in range 11\r\nwest, and in the northern part of it the Brule river rises and flows\r\nnorth into Lake Superior.\r\n\r\n\"At the copper range in township 48, range 10 west, section 23, a\r\nledge of trap rock stands in the valley. In the eddy of this rock and\r\nextending to the southward or up the present stream is a well defined\r\nmoraine of large boulders and gravel showing that the glacial river\r\nran south. To the north of this point the Brule river makes a straight\r\ncut to the lake through sandy red clay deposits peculiar to that\r\nregion.\r\n\r\n\"In this ancient valley the lowest point on the summit at the\r\nheadwaters of these two streams is about 460 feet above Lake Superior\r\n[Lake St. Croix, at Stillwater, is 117 feet higher than Lake Superior]\r\nand 346 feet above Lake St. Croix. Upper Lake St. Croix is 12 feet\r\nbelow this summit. The St. Croix river one mile above the mouth of\r\nMoose river is 25 feet below this summit. The St. Croix river\r\ndischarges 15.360 cubic feet of water per minute at the mouth of Moose\r\ncreek. The Brule river discharges about 5.805 cubic feet of water per\r\nminute in the north part of township 46, range 10. The distance from\r\nTaylor's Falls to Lake Superior by the valley of the St. Croix and the\r\nvalley of the Brule river is nearly 150 miles.\r\n\r\n\"There are several exposures of trap rock along these streams and an\r\nabundance of brown sandstone of good quality for building purposes,\r\nbeing easily worked.\r\n\r\n\"Can Lake St. Croix, at Stillwater, be connected with Lake Superior by\r\ncanal and slackwater navigation? Yes. This question has been\r\ndefinitely settled by the recent examination of the United States\r\nengineers, under the direction of Maj. Chas. J. Allen, of the sources\r\nof the St Croix river, with reference to the construction of\r\nreservoirs to improve the navigation of that river and the\r\nMississippi.\r\n\r\n\"By constructing a dam one mile above the mouth of Moose creek, on the\r\nSt. Croix, of sufficient height to raise the water 25 feet, cutting a\r\ncanal 75 feet wide, 12 feet deep, 1-1/2 miles long, across the summit,\r\nand building a dam in township 46, range 10, across the Brule river,\r\nhigh enough to raise the water to the same height as the dam on the\r\nSt. Croix, and you construct a lake over thirty miles long, affording\r\nuninterrupted navigation across the summit for that distance, and\r\nutilize the waters of the St. Croix and its branches and the Brule,\r\nand by the capacity before given the amount of water is sufficient to\r\npass vessels through locks 75 feet wide, 300 feet long, 12-1/2 feet\r\nlift, at the rate of 3 per hour, or 73 in 24 hours, at the dryest\r\nseason of the year. This settles the question of practicability.\r\n\r\n\"The whole improvement will cost less than $8,000,000, and by placing\r\nthe lowest dam and lock at Prescott so as to always hold Lake St.\r\nCroix at the high water mark will give two hundred miles of slackwater\r\nnavigation connecting the Mississippi river with Lake Superior,\r\naccommodating boats of large size and deep draft, propelled by steam,\r\nat the usual rates of speed used on the rivers. Average cost per mile,\r\n$40,000.\r\n\r\n\"It would accomplish another object. The improvement of navigation on\r\nthe Mississippi river by a system of reservoirs on its tributaries\r\nwould be most effectually accomplished by holding one or two feet of\r\nextra head upon each of the thirteen dams proposed, thus storing up\r\nduring the spring freshets vastly more water than can be held in the\r\nsmall reservoirs on the tributaries of the St. Croix. There are no\r\nvery large natural reservoirs in the Upper St. Croix valley.\r\n\r\n\"Hold a three foot head on the lake as a reserve from the spring\r\nfreshets and you have stored up 34,073,000 cubic yards of water to be\r\nused in the dry season in August and September. Continue this plan to\r\nthe source and you have in the St. Croix valley a continuous reservoir\r\none hundred and fifty miles long. Connect the two systems as proposed\r\nabove and you have a route furnishing the cheapest transportation that\r\ncan be had and at the same time obtain a system of large reservoirs to\r\nimprove the navigation of the Mississippi river.\r\n\r\n\"This is one of the improvements that the Northwest needs for its\r\npresent, future and more perfect development.\r\n\r\n\"The proposition and figures are given, after a series of examinations\r\nextending through a period of over twenty-five years, for the purpose\r\nof calling out investigation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WATERWAYS CONVENTION OF 1885.\r\n\r\nPublic discussions of the matter in the legislature and in conventions\r\nwere not entirely in vain. Public attention was aroused and interest\r\nawakened in the great question of inland navigation. In 1885 the great\r\nwaterways convention convened in St. Paul, at the call of Gov.\r\nHubbard, of Minnesota. This convention was attended by over 1,000\r\ndelegates from the states of Florida, Louisiana, Missouri, Kansas,\r\nNebraska, Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin, and Minnesota, and from the\r\nterritories of Dakota and Montana. Ex-Gov. Bross, of Illinois, acted\r\nas temporary chairman. The permanent organization elected Maj. Wm.\r\nWarren, of Kansas City, president, Gen. G. W. Jones, of Iowa, vice\r\npresident, and Platt B. Walker, of Minnesota, secretary.\r\n\r\nVarious schemes for internal improvement were brought before the\r\nconvention and ably advocated, but each in the interest of a\r\nparticular section. The members from Florida wanted a ship canal for\r\nthat State. Illinois and Eastern Iowa advocated the Hennepin canal\r\nscheme. Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, Western Iowa, Dakota, and Montana\r\ndemanded the improvement of the Missouri river. Wisconsin and\r\nNorthern Iowa the completion of the Fox and Wisconsin canal. Minnesota\r\nand Wisconsin agreed with all for the improvement of the Mississippi\r\nfrom the falls of St. Anthony to the Balize, for the improvement of\r\nthe Sault Ste. Marie canal, and for the internal improvements asked\r\nfor generally in the states and territories represented.\r\n\r\nThe result was the passage of a series of resolutions recommending a\r\nliberal policy in the distribution of improvements, and favoring every\r\nmeritorious project for the increase of facilities for water\r\ntransportation, but recommending as a subject of paramount importance\r\nthe immediate and permanent improvement of the Mississippi and\r\nMissouri rivers and their navigable tributaries. It was recommended\r\nthat the depth of the Mississippi be increased to six feet between\r\nCario and the falls of St. Anthony. The Hennepin canal was strongly\r\nindorsed, as was also the improvement of the Sault Ste. Marie, and of\r\nthe navigation of Wisconsin and Fox rivers, of the Red River of the\r\nNorth, and of the Chippewa, St. Croix and Minnesota rivers. The\r\nconvention unanimously recommended as a sum proper for these\r\nimprovements the appropriation of $25,000,000.\r\n\r\nSome of the papers presented were elaborately prepared, and deserve to\r\nbe placed on permanent record. The memorial of Mr. E. W. Durant, of\r\nStillwater, contains many valuable statistics. We quote that portion\r\ncontaining a statement of the resources and commerce of the valleys of\r\nthe Mississippi and St. Croix:\r\n\r\n\"The Northwestern States have not had the recognition that is due to\r\nthe agricultural and commercial requirements of this vast and poplous\r\nterritory, whose granaries and fields not only feed the millions of\r\nthis continent, but whose annual export constitutes a most important\r\nfactor in the food calculation of foreign nations. During the past\r\ndecade the general government has expended $3,000,000 on the waterways\r\nof the Upper Mississippi. The improvements inaugurated by the general\r\ngovernment in removing many of the serious impediments to navigation\r\nwarrants the belief that still more extensive improvements should be\r\nmade. It is an error to suppose that the palmy days of steamboating on\r\nwestern rivers has passed. In demonstration of this take the quantity\r\nof lumber sent down the Mississippi. There was shipped from the St.\r\nCroix river during the year 1884 to various distributing points along\r\nthe Mississippi river 250,000,000 feet of lumber, 40,000,000 of lath,\r\n37,000,000 of shingles, 2,000,000 of pickets; from the Chippewa river\r\nduring the same period, 883,000,000 feet of lumber, 223,000,000 of\r\nshingles and 102,000,000 of lath and pickets; from Black river during\r\nthe same period was shipped 250,000,000 feet of lumber, 40,000,000\r\nshingles, and 32,000,000 lath and pickets, aggregating 1,383,000,000\r\nfeet of lumber, 300,000,000 of shingles and 176,000,000 of lath. The\r\ntonnage of this product alone foots up over 3,000,000 tons. The lumber\r\nvalue of raft and cargoes annually floated to market on the\r\nMississippi will not vary far from $20,000,000. The capital invested\r\nin steamboats, 100 in number, used for towing purposes is $1,250,000;\r\nwhile the saw mills, timber plants and other investments incidental to\r\nthe prosecution of this branch of industry will foot up fully\r\n$500,000; while the labor and their dependences engaged in this\r\npursuit alone will equal the population of one of our largest western\r\nstates. There are sixteen bridges spanning the river between St. Paul\r\nand St. Louis, and it is important that some additional safeguards be\r\nthrown around these bridges to afford greater safety to river\r\ncommerce.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Durant says there has been a general cry for some time past that\r\nthe days of steamboating on the Northern Mississippi and tributaries\r\nwere over; but he thinks it will be forcibly shown in the coming\r\nconvention that, if they are, the only cause for it is the extremely\r\nshort and uncertain seasons for steamboating, resulting from the\r\nneglected and filled up channels. If the channels can be improved, so\r\nthat steamers can be sure of five months' good running each year, he\r\nthinks they will prove to be one of the most important means of\r\ntransportation in the Upper Mississippi valley. They will then be used\r\nfor the transportation up and down stream of all heavy and slow\r\nfreights in preference to railroads, on account of cheapness. It would\r\nprove a new and the greatest era in upper river steamboating.\r\n\r\nIt appears from a report made at the convention, that during the year\r\n1884 there were 175 steamboats plying on the Mississippi from St.\r\nLouis to points above. Two thousand seven hundred rafts from the St.\r\nCroix and Chippewa passed the Winona bridge, and the total number of\r\nfeet of logs and lumber floated down the Mississippi from the St.\r\nCroix, Chippewa and Black rivers was 1,366,000,000. The total\r\npassages of steamers through the Winona bridge for 1887 was 4,492. On\r\nthe St. Croix, above Lake St. Croix, during the season of 1887 there\r\nwere 3 steamers and 25 barges engaged in freight and passenger traffic\r\nonly. The steamers made 141 round trips between Stillwater and\r\nTaylor's Falls, 75 round trips between Marine and St. Paul, and 20\r\nround trips between Franconia and St. Paul.\r\n\r\nThe following is a showing of the lumber, logs, rafting, and towing\r\nbusiness on the St. Croix during 1887: There were 51 steamers engaged\r\nin towing logs and lumber out of the St. Croix and down the\r\nMississippi, the total number of feet handled by them being\r\n250,000,000, board measure: The total number of feet of logs (board\r\nmeasure) which passed through the St. Croix boom in 1887 was\r\n325,000,000. The lumber manufacture of the St. Croix during that year\r\nwas valued at $2,393,323.\r\n\r\n\r\nRESOLUTION INTRODUCED AT THE WATERWAYS CONVENTION HELD IN ST. PAUL,\r\nSEPTEMBER, 1885.\r\n\r\nWHEREAS, The North American continent is penetrated by two great water\r\nsystems both of which originate upon the tablelands of Minnesota, one\r\nthe Mississippi river and its tributaries, reaching southward from the\r\nBritish line to the Gulf of Mexico, watering the greatest body of\r\nfertile land on the globe,--the future seat of empire of the human\r\nfamily on earth,--the other the chain of great lakes flowing\r\neastwardly and constituting with the St. Lawrence river a great water\r\ncauseway in the direct line of the flow of the world's commerce from\r\nthe heart of the continent to the Atlantic; and\r\n\r\nWHEREAS, Between the navigable waters of these continental dividing\r\nsystems there is but a gap of ninety miles in width from Taylor's\r\nFalls on the St. Croix, to Duluth on Lake Superior, through a region\r\nof easily worked drift formation, with a rise of but five hundred and\r\nsixty feet to overcome, and plentifully supplied with water from the\r\nhighest point of the water-shed; therefore,\r\n\r\n_Resolved_. That we demand of Congress the construction of a canal\r\nfrom Taylor's Falls to Duluth, using the Upper St. Croix and the St.\r\nLouis rivers as far as the same can be made navigable, the said canal\r\nto be forever free of toll or charge, and to remain a public highway\r\nfor the interchange of the productions of the Mississippi valley and\r\nthe valley of the great lakes; and should the railway interests of the\r\ncountry prove powerful enough to prevent congressional action to this\r\nend, we call upon the states of the Northwest to unite and build, at\r\ntheir own cost, such a canal, believing that the increased value of\r\nthe productions of the country would speedily repay the entire outlay.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY STEAMBOAT NAVIGATION.\r\n\r\nThe Pennsylvania was the first steamer that descended the Mississippi.\r\nShe came down the Ohio from Pittsburgh, creating the utmost terror in\r\nthe minds of the simple-hearted people who had lately been rather\r\nrudely shaken by an earthquake, and supposed the noise of the coming\r\nsteamer to be but the precursor of another shake. When the\r\nPennsylvania approached Shawneetown, Illinois, the people crowded the\r\nriver shore, and in their alarm fell down upon their knees and prayed\r\nto be delivered from the muttering, roaring earthquake coming down the\r\nriver, its furnaces glowing like the open portals of the nether world.\r\nMany fled to the hills in utter dismay at the frightful appearance of\r\nthe hitherto unknown monster, and the dismal sounds it emitted. It\r\nproduced the same and even greater terror in the scant settlements of\r\nthe Lower Mississippi.\r\n\r\nIn 1823 Capt. Shreve commanded the Gen. Washington, the fastest boat\r\nthat had as yet traversed the western rivers. This year the Gen.\r\nWashington made the trip from New Orleans to Louisville, Kentucky, in\r\ntwenty-five days. When at Louisville he anchored his boat in the\r\nmiddle of the river and fired twenty-five guns in honor of the event,\r\none for each day out. The population of Louisville feted and honored\r\nthe gallant captain for his achievement. He was crowned with flowers,\r\nand borne through the streets by the huzzaing crowd. A rich banquet\r\nwas spread, and amidst the hilarity excited by the flowing bowl, the\r\ncaptain made an eloquent speech which was vociferously applauded. He\r\ndeclared that the time made by the Gen. Washington could never be\r\nequaled by any other boat. Curiously enough, some later in the season,\r\nthe Tecumseh made the trip in nine days. The time made by the Tecumseh\r\nwas not beaten until 1833, when the Shepherdess carried away the\r\nlaurels for speed.\r\n\r\nWe have but little definite information as to navigation on the\r\nMississippi during the ten years subsequent to the trip of the\r\nPennsylvania. The solitude of the Upper Mississippi was unbroken by\r\nthe advent of any steamer until the year 1823. On the second of May in\r\nthat year the Virginia, a steamer 118 feet in length, 22 in width,\r\nwith a draught of 6 feet, left her moorings at St. Louis levee for\r\nFort Snelling laden with stores for the fort. She was four days\r\npassing the Rock Island rapids, and made but slow progress throughout.\r\nIt is heedless to say that the Indians were as much frightened at the\r\nappearance of the \"fire canoe\" as the settlers of the Ohio valley had\r\nbeen, and made quick time escaping to the hills.\r\n\r\nJudge James H. Lockwood narrates (see Vol. II, Wisconsin Historical\r\nCollections, page 152) that in 1824 Capt. David G. Bates brought a\r\nsmall boat named the Putnam up to Prairie du Chien, and took it thence\r\nto Fort Snelling with supplies for the troops. The steamer Neville\r\nalso made the voyage to Prairie du Chien in 1824. The following year\r\ncame the steamer Mandan and in 1826 the Indiana and Lawrence. Fletcher\r\nWilliams, in his history of St. Paul, says that from 1823 to 1826 as\r\nmany as fifteen steamers had arrived at Fort Snelling, and that\r\nafterward their arrivals were more frequent.\r\n\r\nDuring this primitive period, the steamboats had no regular time for\r\narrival and departure at ports. A time table would have been an\r\nabsurdity. \"Go as you please\" or \"go as you can,\" was the order of the\r\nday. Passengers had rare opportunities for observation and discovery,\r\nand were frequently allowed pleasure excursions on shore while the\r\nboat was being cordelled over a rapid, was stranded on a bar, or\r\nwaiting for wood to be cut and carried on board at some wooding\r\nstation. Sometimes they were called upon to lend a helping hand at the\r\ncapstan, or to tread the gang plank to a \"wood up\" quickstep. When on\r\ntheir pleasure excursion they strayed away too far, they were recalled\r\nto the boat by the firing of a gun or the ringing of a bell. It is\r\ndoubtful if in later days, with all the improvements in steamboat\r\ntravel, more enjoyable voyages have been made than these free and easy\r\nexcursions in the light draught boats of the decades between 1830 and\r\n1850, under such genial captains and officers as the Harrises,\r\nAtchinson, Throckmorton, Brasie, Ward, Blakeley, Lodwick, Munford,\r\nPim, Orrin Smith and others.\r\n\r\nBefore the government had improved navigation the rapids of Rock\r\nIsland and Des Moines, and snags, rocks and sandbars elsewhere were\r\nserious obstructions. The passengers endured the necessary delays from\r\nthese causes with great good nature, and the tedium of the voyage was\r\nfrequently enlivened by boat races with rival steamers. These\r\npassenger boats were then liberally patronized. The cost of a trip\r\nfrom St. Louis to St. Paul was frequently reduced to ten dollars, and\r\nconsidering the time spent in making the trip (often as much as two or\r\nthree weeks) was cheaper than board in a good hotel, while the fare on\r\nthe boat could not be excelled. The boats were frequently crowded with\r\npassengers, whole families were grouped about the tables or strolling\r\non the upper decks, with groups of travelers representing all the\r\nprofessions and callings, travelers for pleasure and for business,\r\nexplorers, artists, and adventurers. At night the brilliantly lighted\r\ncabin would resound with music, furnished by the boat's band of sable\r\nminstrels, and trembled to the tread of the dancers as much as to the\r\nthrobbing of the engine.\r\n\r\nThe steamer, as the one means of communication with the distant world,\r\nas the bearer of mails, of provisions and articles of trade, was\r\ngreeted at every village with eager and excited groups of people, some\r\nperhaps expecting the arrival of friends, while others were there to\r\npart with them. These were scenes to be remembered long, in fact many\r\nof the associations of river travel produced indelible impressions. In\r\nthese days of rapid transit by rail more than half the delights of\r\ntraveling are lost. Before the settlement of the country the wildness\r\nof the scene had a peculiar charm. The majestic bluffs with their\r\nrugged escarpments of limestone stretched away in solitary grandeur on\r\neither side of the river. The perpendicular crags crowning the bluffs\r\nseemed like ruined castles, some of them with rounded turrets and\r\nbattlements, some even with arched portals. Along the slopes of the\r\nbluffs was a growth of sturdy oaks, in their general contour and\r\narrangement resembling fruit trees, vast, solitary orchards in\r\nappearance, great enough to supply the world with fruit. On the slopes\r\nof the river bank might have been seen occasionally the bark wigwams\r\nof the Indian, and his birch canoe gliding silently under the shadow\r\nof the elms and willows lining the shore. Occasionally a deer would be\r\nseen grazing on some upland glade, or bounding away in terror at sight\r\nof the steamer.\r\n\r\nA complete history of early steamboat navigation on the Upper\r\nMississippi would abound with interesting narratives and incidents;\r\nbut of these, unfortunately, there is no authentic record, and we can\r\nonly speak in general terms of the various companies that successively\r\ncontrolled the trade and travel of the river, or were rivals for the\r\npatronage of the public. During the decade of the '30s, the Harrises,\r\nof Galena, ran several small boats from Galena to St. Louis,\r\noccasionally to Fort Snelling, or through the difficult current of the\r\nWisconsin to Fort Winnebago, towing barges laden with supplies for the\r\nWisconsin pineries. Capt. Scribe Harris' favorite boat from 1835 to\r\n1838 was the Smelter. The captain greatly delighted in her speed,\r\ndecorated her gaily with evergreens, and rounding to at landings, or\r\nmeeting with other boats, fired a cannon from her prow to announce her\r\nimperial presence.\r\n\r\nThe Smelter and other boats run by the Harris family held the commerce\r\nof the river for many years. In 1846 the first daily line of steamers\r\nabove St. Louis was established. These boats ran independently, but on\r\nstated days, from St. Louis to Galena and Dubuque. They were the\r\nTempest, Capt. John J. Smith; War Eagle, Capt. Smith Harris; Prairie\r\nBird, Capt. Niebe Wall; Monona, Capt. ---- Bersie; St. Croix, Capt.\r\n----; Fortune, Capt. Mark Atchinson. These boat owners, with others,\r\nsubsequently formed a consolidated company.\r\n\r\nIn 1847 a company was formed for the navigation of the Mississippi\r\nabove Galena. The first boat in the line, the Argo, commanded by\r\nRussell Blakeley, was placed upon the river in 1846. The boats in this\r\nline were the Argo, Dr. Franklin, Senator, Nominee, Ben Campbell, War\r\nEagle, and the Galena.\r\n\r\nIn 1854 the Galena & Minnesota Packet Company was formed by a\r\nconsolidation of various interests. The company consisted of the\r\nfollowing stockholders: O. Smith, the Harrises, James Carter, H.\r\nCorwith, B. H. Campbell, D. B. Morehouse, H. M. Rice, H. L. Dousman,\r\nH. H. Sibley, and Russell Blakeley. The boats of the new company were\r\nthe War Eagle, Galena, Dr. Franklin, Nominee, and the West Newton. In\r\n1857 a new company was formed, and the Dubuque boats, the Itasca and\r\nKey City, were added to the line. This line continued until 1862, and\r\nthe new boats, Dr. Franklin, No. 2, and the New St. Paul, were added.\r\nThe Galena had been burned at Red Wing in the fall of 1857.\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of the earliest arrivals at St. Paul after the\r\nopening of navigation between the years 1843 and 1858: April 5, 1843,\r\nsteamer Otter, Capt. Harris; April 6, 1844, steamer Otter, Capt.\r\nHarris; April 6, 1845, steamer Otter, Capt. Harris; March 31, 1846,\r\nsteamer Lynx, Capt.

Ward; Pembina, Capt. Griffith; Denmark, Capt. Gray;\r\nMetropolitan, Capt. Rhodes; Lucy May, Capt. Jenks; Wm. L. Ewing, Capt.\r\nGreen; Henry Clay, Capt. Campbell; Fred Lorenz, Capt. Parker;\r\nNortherner, Capt. Alvord; Minnesota Belle, Capt. Hill; Northern Light\r\nand York State, Capt. ----.\r\n\r\nCommodore W. F. Davidson commenced steamboating on the Upper\r\nMississippi in 1856 with the Jacob Traber. In 1857 he added the Frank\r\nSteele, and included the Minnesota river in his field of operations.\r\nIn 1859 he added the Æolian, Favorite and Winona. In 1860 he organized\r\nthe La Crosse & Minnesota Packet Company, with the five above named\r\nsteamers in the line. In 1862 the Keokuk and Northern Belle were\r\nadded.\r\n\r\nIn 1864 the La Crosse & Minnesota and the Northern Line Packet\r\ncompanies were consolidated under the name of the Northwestern Union\r\nPacket Company, with the following steamers: The Moses McLellan, Ocean\r\nWave, Itasca, Key City, Milwaukee City, Belle, War Eagle, Phil\r\nSheridan, S. S. Merrill, Alex. Mitchell, City of St. Paul, Tom Jasper,\r\nBelle of La Crosse, City of Quincy, and John Kyle. This line\r\ncontrolled the general trade until 1874.\r\n\r\nThere were upon the river and its tributaries during the period named\r\nthe following light draught boats: The Julia, Mollie Mohler, Cutter,\r\nChippewa Falls, Mankato, Albany, Ariel, Stella Whipple, Isaac Gray,\r\nMorning Star, Antelope, Clara Hine, Geo. S. Weeks, Dexter, Damsel,\r\nAddie Johnson, Annie Johnson, G. H. Wilson, Flora, and Hudson.\r\n\r\n\r\nLATER NAVIGATION ON THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI.\r\n\r\nThe Northwestern Union Packet Company, more familiarly known as the\r\n\"White Collar Line,\" from the white band painted around the upper part\r\nof the smokestacks, and the Keokuk Packet Company, sold their steamers\r\nto the Keokuk Northern Line Packet Company, which continued until\r\n1882, when the St. Louis & St. Paul Packet Company was organized. Its\r\nboats were: The Minneapolis, Red Wing, Minnesota, Dubuque, Rock\r\nIsland, Lake Superior, Muscatine, Clinton, Chas. Cheever, Dan Hine,\r\nAndy Johnson, Harry Johnson, Rob Roy, Lucy Bertram, Steven Bayard, War\r\nEagle, Golden Eagle, Gem City, White Eagle, and Flying Eagle.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEAMBOATING ON THE ST. CROIX.\r\n\r\nThe steamer Palmyra was the first boat to disturb the solitude of the\r\nSt. Croix. In June, 1838, it passed up the St. Croix lake and river as\r\nfar as the Dalles. The steamer Ariel, the second boat, came as far as\r\nMarine in 1839. In the fall of 1843, the steamer Otter, Scribe Harris,\r\ncommanding, landed at Stillwater. The steamer Otter was laden with\r\nirons and machinery for the first mill in Stillwater. Up to 1845\r\nnearly every boat that ascended the Mississippi also ascended the St.\r\nCroix, but in later years, as larger boats were introduced, its\r\nnavigation was restricted to smaller craft, and eventually to\r\nsteamboats built for the special purpose of navigating the St. Croix.\r\nQuite a number of these were built at Osceola, Franconia and Taylor's\r\nFalls. The following is a list of boats navigating the St. Croix from\r\nthe year 1852 to the present time: Humboldt, 1852; Enterprise, 1853;\r\nPioneer, 1854; Osceola, 1854; H. S. Allen, 1857; Fanny Thornton, 1862;\r\nViola, 1864; Dalles, 1866; Nellie Kent, 1867; G. B. Knapp, 1866;\r\nMinnie Will, 1867; Wyman X, 1868; Mark Bradley, 1869; Helen Mar, 1870;\r\nMaggie Reany, 1870; Jennie Hays, 1870; Cleon, 1870.\r\n\r\nA number of raft steamers, built at South Stillwater and elsewhere,\r\nhave plied the river within the last ten years. A number of barges\r\nwere built at South Stillwater, Osceola and Taylor's Falls.\r\n\r\nThe passenger travel on the St. Croix has decreased since the\r\ncompletion of the railroad to Taylor's Falls and St. Croix Falls.\r\n\r\nAn interesting chapter of anecdotes and incidents might be compiled,\r\nillustrating the early steamboat life on the St. Croix. We find in\r\n\"Bond's Minnesota\" a notice of one of the first boats in the regular\r\ntrade, which will throw some light on the subject of early travel on\r\nthe river. It describes the Humboldt, which made its first appearance\r\nin 1852:\r\n\r\n\"In addition, some adventurous genius on a small scale, down about\r\nOquaka, Illinois, last year conceived the good idea of procuring a\r\nsteamboat suitable to perform the duties of a tri-weekly packet\r\nbetween Stillwater and Taylor's Falls, the extreme point of steam\r\nnavigation up the St. Croix. It is true he did not appear to have a\r\nvery correct idea of the kind of craft the people really wanted and\r\nwould well support in that trade, but such as he thought and planned\r\nhe late last season, brought forth. * * Indeed, the little Humboldt is\r\na great accommodation to the people of the St. Croix. She stops\r\nanywhere along the river, to do any and all kinds of business that may\r\noffer, and will give passengers a longer ride, so far as _time_ is\r\nconcerned, for a dollar, than any other craft we ever traveled upon.\r\nShe is also, to outward appearances, a temperance boat, and carries no\r\ncooking or table utensils. She stops at the 'Marine,' going and\r\nreturning, to allow the people aboard to feed upon a good, substantial\r\ndinner; and the passengers are allowed, if they feel so disposed, to\r\ncarry 'bars' in their side pockets and 'bricks' in their hats. A very\r\naccommodating craft is the Humboldt, and a convenience that is already\r\nset down on the St. Croix as one indispensable.\"\r\n\r\nThe Diamond Jo line of steamers was established in 1867. Jo Reynolds\r\nwas president of the company and has served as such continuously to\r\ndate. Under his general supervision the company has been quite\r\nsuccessful. The business has required an average of six steamers\r\nyearly. In 1888 the line consists of the boats the Sidney, Pittsburgh\r\nand Mary Morton.\r\n\r\nThe St. Louis & St. Paul Packet Company, successors of the various old\r\ntransportation companies, is in successful operation in 1888,\r\nemploying three steamers. There are but few transient boats now on the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\n\r\nICE BOATS.\r\n\r\nSeveral attempts have been made to navigate the river during the\r\nwinter months by means of ice boats, but the efforts have uniformly\r\nfailed. Of these attempts we mention the two most notable:\r\n\r\nNoman Wiard, an inventor of some celebrity, made an ice boat in 1856\r\nand placed it on the river at Prairie du Chien, intending to run\r\nbetween that point and St. Paul. It was elaborately planned and\r\nelegantly finished, and resembled somewhat a palace car mounted on\r\nsteel runners. It failed on account of the roughness of the ice, never\r\nmaking a single trip. It, however, proved somewhat remunerative as a\r\nshow, and was for some time on exhibition within an inclosure at\r\nPrairie du Chien.\r\n\r\nMartin Mower, of Osceola, Minnesota, invented a boat to run on the\r\nice between Stillwater and Taylor's Falls, in the winter of 1868-9. It\r\nmade several trips, carrying passengers and freight. The rough ice\r\nprevented regular trips and the project was abandoned.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEAMBOAT LIFE--1846.\r\n\r\nJames W. Mullen, of Taylor's Falls, spent much of his early and middle\r\nlife on the river, and cherishes many pleasant recollections of the\r\nearly days. We have been favored with a few of these, which will give\r\nthe reader a vivid idea of the scenes depicted:\r\n\r\n\"A. D. 1816 found me a cabin boy on the War Eagle at the St. Louis\r\nlevee, with sign board up for Stillwater and Fort Snelling. The levee\r\nwas a wonder to behold. It was thronged with teams, policemen keeping\r\nthem in rank. Piles of freight were awaiting shipment. Steamboats for\r\nthree-quarters of a mile along the levee were discharging and\r\nreceiving freight; passengers were rushing frantically to and fro;\r\nbells were ringing, and boats leaving for the Cumberland, Tennessee,\r\nMissouri and Illinois rivers; and New Orleans, Cincinnati, Pittsburgh,\r\nKeokuk, Galena, Stillwater, and Fort Snelling.\r\n\r\n\"It was a delightful June day on which we pulled out from this busy\r\nscene and commenced our voyage to the far off north land, then known\r\nas Wisconsin Territory. Capt. Smith Harris gave the last tap of the\r\nbell; the lines were loosened; the wheels of the War Eagle revolved\r\nslowly at first, and we were soon on the broad bosom of the\r\nMississippi, heading northward in the wake and black smoke of the\r\nsteamers Ocean Wave, Tobacco Plant and Western Belle. The Luella, the\r\nAlton packet, followed us closely, racing with us. All was enjoyment.\r\nWe pass the steamers Osprey and Di Vernon. At Nauvoo we note the\r\nmagnificent Mormon temple on the high ground, and also long files of\r\nMormons going westward. We pass many fine farms, much beautiful\r\nscenery, and many growing towns, among them Rock Island and Davenport,\r\nthe latter the home of Antoine Le Clair, a half-breed Indian trader\r\nand heavyweight, tipping the beam at three hundred and fifty pounds\r\navoirdupois. He lives there in sumptuous splendor from his profits\r\nmade in trade. The villages, or tepees, of Sac and Fox Indians are\r\nseen along the shores; their bark canoes glide silently over the\r\nwaters. Further on we ascend for seven miles the sluggish and narrow\r\nchannel of Fever river, and find ourselves at Galena, the home of the\r\nHarrises, river captains.\r\n\r\n\"We find at the levee here the steamers Falcon and St. Croix, laden\r\nwith lead for St. Louis. Back through Fever river to the Mississippi\r\nand past Dubuque, an active, rising town; past Cassville, the expected\r\nbut disappointed capital city of Wisconsin Territory, a lovely\r\nlocation, its castellated hills frowning above it and its fine three\r\nstory brick hotel and other buildings; past Prairie du Chien and Fort\r\nCrawford, with soldiers drilling on the green. Here Amable Moreau, a\r\nFrench Upper Mississippi pilot, came on board. Squads of Indians were\r\nhanging around begging for whisky and tobacco. Resuming our way,\r\nstemming the current of the river we pass other scenes, other birch\r\ncanoes gliding over the waves, other tepees and Indian villages along\r\nthe shore. At La Crosse we find a few whites and lots of Indians on an\r\nunimproved prairie, with a background of high bluffs. We pass\r\nTrempeleau and then Winona prairie, on which we find an old Indian\r\nvillage, dating back to unknown time. Opposite the mouth of the\r\nChippewa river we pass Nelson's Landing with its two log warehouses\r\nand mackinaw boats loading for the Chippewa river. We pass into lovely\r\nLake Pepin, Maiden's Rock or Lover's Leap rising into a battlement on\r\nthe right, and the famous Point-no-Point on the left. Out of the\r\nbeautiful lake again into the river, between low, forest covered\r\nislands, till we pass Barn Bluff or Mount La Grange, a bold, abrupt\r\nand isolated hill just below Red Wing. We passed more Indian tepees,\r\nvillages and burying grounds,--not that, for the dead bodies of the\r\nIndians were not buried but fastened upon scaffolds and the limbs of\r\ntrees, according to Sioux custom. At the mouth of St. Croix river we\r\npass Prescott Landing, where lives the old pioneer trader Philander\r\nPrescott. Across the St. Croix, opposite Prescott Landing, is Point\r\nDouglas. Some miles above Point Douglas we pass Little Crow village, a\r\nmissionary station, where young Indian boys ran down to the landing\r\nand greeted us with such yells as have not rung through these wilds,\r\nperhaps, for ages past.\r\n\r\n\"We find St. Paul to be a small village. There are a few houses on a\r\nhigh, almost perpendicular bluff, overlooking the river. At the base\r\nof the bluff on the river shore stands a warehouse with the sign\r\n'Choteau & Valle.' We are soon at Mendota and Fort Snelling. A squad\r\nof soldiers guard the freight over night. We have ample time in the\r\nmorning to visit the post before starting down the river, and the\r\nfollowing morning finds the prow of the War Eagle resting against the\r\nStillwater landing. Here Capt. Harris greets his friends and is warmly\r\nwelcomed. So far, Stillwater seemed the most active and enterprising\r\nvillage on the whole route. Joe Brown's town, Dakota, lies a short\r\ndistance above at the head of the lake. Capt. Harris on his return\r\ntowed a raft comprising ten acres of logs. Big Joe was one of the\r\npilots on the raft.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nST. CROIX BOOM COMPANY.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the organization of the boom company, in 1857, the logs\r\nwere floated down the St. Croix and caught in side booms by individual\r\nowners, and owners of lake booms would raft them indiscriminately,\r\nregardless of log marks, but with the mark side up for the convenience\r\nof scaling. The scaling was done by some responsible party in the\r\ninterest of the various owners, and balances were settled by\r\nexchanges, or if not balanced by cash or by note, to be paid out of\r\nthe profits of the next year's logs. Instances of fraud seldom\r\noccurred. When Minnesota became a territory this system was superseded\r\nby another method of handling, assorting or delivering. The\r\nlegislature established surveyor general districts, of which the St.\r\nCroix valley was designated as the First. The surveyors general were\r\nelected in a joint convention of the two houses of the legislature,\r\nand the candidacy for this office, together with questions of salary,\r\nbecame a leading feature in the politics of the district.\r\n\r\nThe surveyors general of the First district have been, Robert Harsy,\r\nSamuel Winship, Charles J. Gardiner, Ivory McKusick, James D. McComb,\r\nZ. Wilder Chase, John S. Proctor, and Al. Hospice. The law defining\r\nthe duties of the surveyors general has been awarded from time to\r\ntime, and the system of scaling improved till it has reached its\r\npresent form, in which it meets with very general approval. In 1867 a\r\nlaw was passed giving to the governor the power of appointing\r\nsurveyors general.\r\n\r\nThe boom company was organized by the territorial legislature, Feb. 7,\r\n1851, with a capital stock of $10,000, with privileges of increase to\r\n$25,000. The incorporators were Orange Walker and George B. Judd, of\r\nMarine; John McKusick, Socrates Nel son and Levi Churchill, of\r\nStillwater; Daniel Mears and William Kent, of Osceola; and W. H. C.\r\nFolsom, of Taylor's Falls. Fred R. Bartlett was the first secretary,\r\nbut was superseded by David B. Loomis.\r\n\r\nThe first boom was built near an island lying opposite and above\r\nOsceola. The surveyor general had his office at Stillwater, an\r\narrangement that gave great satisfaction, but as the boom was not\r\nadvantageously located, the channel of the river above being too\r\nnarrow for the annually increasing production of logs, the company, in\r\n1856, obtained a new charter with power to construct booms from the\r\nhead of Lake St. Croix to Taylor's Falls. The capital stock was\r\nincreased to $25,000 with the privilege of increasing it to $50,000.\r\nIt was subsequently increased to $100,000. The incorporators of the\r\nnew company were Martin Mower, W. H. C. Folsom, Isaac Staples,\r\nChristopher Carli and Samuel Burkelo.\r\n\r\nThe company placed a second boom a mile and a half above Stillwater.\r\nThe increase of their business compelled them from time to time to\r\nbuild side booms and shear booms to prevent the logs from lodging\r\nagainst the banks or passing bayous or secondary channels, and also to\r\nkeep the primary channel free from obstructions to navigation. They\r\nbuilt firm and expensive piers, drove piling and made canals for the\r\nuse of steamboats when the main channel was wanted for booming\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all this care, navigation was frequently obstructed by\r\nthe accumulation of logs. Litigation ensued, and heavy expenses were\r\nincurred in defending the rights of the company or paying damages.\r\nThese controversies were not unattended with ill feeling. Public\r\nmeetings were frequently held and denunciating resolutions adopted. In\r\none case, when navigation had been interrupted for fifty-seven days,\r\nthe damages were estimated at $146,525. Some controversies also arose\r\nas to jurisdiction. St. Croix river being the boundary line between\r\ntwo states, the Wisconsin authorities claimed concurrent jurisdiction.\r\nThe boom company was organized under Minnesota law and its members\r\nwere residents of Minnesota. The surveyor general of the First\r\ndistrict claimed entire jurisdiction and scaled the logs irrespective\r\nof the state in which they were cut. The action of the surveyor\r\ngeneral had been accepted both by the original owners and purchasers\r\nof the logs.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1885, Gov. Hubbard, of Minnesota, appointed A. L. Hospes\r\nsurveyor general, and the appointment creating some dissatisfaction, a\r\nlumberman's board of exchange was organized, and Judson McKusick was\r\nappointed as private scaler. He proceeded, under the direction of the\r\nexchange, to scale logs that had already been scaled by Hospes. When\r\nthe members of the exchange proceeded to take possession of their logs\r\nand run them out into the lake, Hospes commenced a series of\r\ninjunction cases to prevent them from so doing. The exchange brought\r\nsuit against Hospes in Wisconsin courts to prevent him from scaling\r\nlogs owned by the exchange. The exchange also declared that McKusick\r\nwas a deputy of the general surveyor of the Fourth district,\r\nWisconsin. Pending these suits, Hospes commenced a _quo warranto_\r\nproceeding in the Minnesota supreme court to have the articles of\r\nincorporation of the exchange annulled, but was defeated on the ground\r\nthat the exchange could employ a private scaler at will, but held that\r\nsuch scaler could not interfere with the claims of Hospes, he being\r\nrecognized as surveyor general. In July of the same year the claims of\r\nthe conflicting parties were settled by the parties themselves,\r\noutside the courts, and the question of conflicting jurisdiction has\r\ntherefore never been legally determined. It is true that some courts\r\nhave passed upon the question, and appeals have been taken to higher\r\ncourts. The decision of Judge Nelson of the supreme court has been\r\ngiven, a decision that the surveyor general of the First district of\r\nMinnesota has a right to scale all logs in his district, yet by his\r\nown decision Wisconsin has equal rights under concurrent jurisdiction.\r\nShould both state authorities under their surveyors general claim\r\njurisdiction at the same time, concurrent jurisdiction would lead to a\r\ndouble taxation upon log owners. It seems, however, to be an admitted\r\nprinciple that when suits between the same parties, in relation to the\r\nsame matter, are pending at the same time in different courts of\r\njurisdiction, a judgment in the one may act as a bar to further\r\nproceedings in the other. The question ought to be more definitely and\r\nsatisfactorily settled.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LANGUAGE OF THE LOGS.\r\n\r\nIt may not be amiss to explain somewhat in detail the system of\r\nmarking adopted by the lumbermen. Owners of logs must be able to\r\nidentify their property or lose the reward of their labor. A system of\r\nmarking each log has, therefore, become a feature of the lumbering\r\nbusiness, and has been in existence ever since lumbering has been\r\nprosecuted. When the business was confined to a limited number of\r\nfirms it was an easy matter, and one of mutual arrangement, to select\r\nthe property. But firms change; from a score the number of lumber\r\nfirms increased to hundreds. A record of ownership of log marks is\r\nnecessary, and a law has been enacted protecting the ownership of a\r\nmark as thoroughly as a trade mark is protected. This system of marks\r\nin the process of time has become a language in itself deep and\r\nintricate to the average mind, but as plain as the alphabet to every\r\nman having to do with the manufacture of logs. It is the aim of every\r\nlumberman originating a mark to make it simple, containing as many\r\nstraight lines as possible, so that it can be put on the log speedily.\r\nThese marks are cut on the logs, through the bark and a few inches\r\ninto the body of the timber, soon after the tree is felled, by a\r\nskilled axeman who is charged with the duty. The cut is made deeper\r\nthan the bark so it will be preserved after the bark comes off. The\r\nmark is made upon the side of the log.\r\n\r\nThis system of marks is a language in itself. Every prominent firm has\r\na particular character, which, in a general way, is indicative of his\r\nownership or interest in the log. This mark may be varied by\r\nadditional or supplementary characters, indicating who cut the log, on\r\nwhose land it was cut, or under what particular contract it was put\r\ninto the stream. Some idea of the extent and variety of these marks\r\ncan be formed from the statement that there is recorded in the St.\r\nCroix district--only a small portion of the entire lumber region of\r\nthe Northwest--over 1,700 different and distinct characters. Many of\r\nthese are quaint and interesting, and the whole etymology curious in\r\nthe extreme.\r\n\r\nIn the books in the surveyor general's office these marks and figures\r\nare the only characters used except in the recording of the marks\r\nthemselves and of instruments and agreements. The identity of mark and\r\nits association of ownership necessarily calls into play the utmost\r\nfamiliarity. To one not thoroughly familiar with the method the books\r\nare about as intelligible as the figures on the side of a Chinese tea\r\nchest to the average American. Once a man becomes thoroughly familiar\r\nwith the marks on a river where lumbering is so extensively carried on\r\nas on the St. Croix, he becomes invaluable in the surveyor general's\r\noffice, or in the booms, identified in some capacity with the scaling\r\nprocess. The fact that some particular character runs through the\r\nvaried marks of all the leading firms is a key to the readiest\r\nunderstanding, just as the twenty-six characters in the alphabet are\r\nnecessarily understood before one can read readily or intelligently.\r\n\r\nWhen the logs reach the booms the marks serve as a guide in their\r\ndistribution by the scaler, whose business it is to measure the logs,\r\ncall out the number of feet in each log to the tallyman, who records\r\nit in a book kept for the purpose, the record, together with the mark\r\nattached, to be forwarded to the surveyor general's office, there to\r\nbe posted and footed. A small army of men is engaged in bringing logs\r\nto the gap, a narrow passage admitting scarcely more than one log at a\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nA catch mark is a mark representing the original mark and is so placed\r\nas to appear always upon the upper side when the log floats at rest.\r\nOnce through the gap, experienced men gather the logs, as they are\r\nfloated downward by the current, into brills. These are subsequently\r\ngathered together in rafts, laid, as a rule, with the logs headed in\r\nthe direction of the current. Rafts may be transported to any distance\r\nsouthward by the current of the stream, and through the waters of the\r\nlake, and not infrequently the whole distance by tow boats.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMOUNT OF LOGS CUT FROM 1857 TO 1888.\r\n\r\nThe earliest statistics in the following table are from persons\r\noperating, and the later from record books.

In\r\n1870, by legislative act, the charter was amended by permission to\r\nerect sixteen dams, to be built severally on the waters of the Upper\r\nSt. Croix, Moose, Eau Claire, Namakagon, Totogatic, Yellow, and Clam\r\nrivers. The name was changed to the \"St. Croix Dam Company,\" and the\r\ncapital stock was fixed at $50,000. The incorporators were A. M.\r\nChase, Joel Nason, Henry D. Barron, Wm. Kent, and S. B. Dresser. A. M.\r\nChase was the first president. The company had permission under the\r\ncharter to hold the water during the seasons when it was not necessary\r\nto navigation on the St. Croix. These dams were usually shut down to\r\ngather a head during the months of March and April, with the exception\r\nof the dams on the Namakagon and Eau Claire, which have the privilege\r\nof gathering and retaining a head of water during any part of the\r\nyear. The head of water above these dams varied from seven to ten\r\nfeet, and the average cost of construction was $4,000. The tolls per\r\n1,000 feet at these dams were as follows: Namakagon and Clam, 25 and\r\n20 cents; at Totogatic, 20 and 15 cents; St. Croix, 20 and 15 cents;\r\nother dams, 3 to 10 cents.\r\n\r\nA. M. Chase was the original mover in organizing the corporation and\r\nforwarding its interests. He was foreman in selecting sites and\r\nbuilding the various dams. He was also owner and general agent until\r\nwithin the last few years, when he transferred his interests to other\r\nparties. The charter expires in 1893.\r\n\r\nThe dam on Clam river, built at a cost of $10,000, was, in 1886, blown\r\nup by dynamite and destroyed by Robert Davidson, who claimed that the\r\nflowage interfered with his meadow lands.\r\n\r\n\r\nLUMBERING ON THE ST. CROIX IN 1845.\r\n\r\nThe progress of civilization involving the building of railways, the\r\ntransformation of the wilderness into cultivated fields, the growth of\r\nvillages and cities, the increased facilities for manufacturing and\r\nthe bringing the forest domain under law, has created such changes in\r\nthe business of lumbering as to justify the insertion of a chapter\r\nrelating to the life and surroundings of the early lumberman. Let us\r\ngo back to the year 1845. The country, save a few sparse settlements\r\non the navigable streams, is as yet an unbroken wilderness, and\r\ntenanted only by wild beasts and roving Indians. There are vast\r\nregions, densely wooded, in which the sound of the woodman's axe has\r\nnever been heard, lying about the headwaters of the Chippewa, St.\r\nCroix and other streams. These pineries can only be reached by\r\nstemming the currents of the minor streams in bateaux or birch bark\r\ncanoes, or by traversing the country on foot or with teams. Parties\r\noperating must purchase their outfit, consisting of teams, supplies of\r\nflour, pork, etc., in Illinois or Missouri. Sometimes they drive their\r\nteams through unsettled country, without roads, swimming and fording\r\nstreams, clearing away obstructions, and camping where night overtakes\r\nthem. Sometimes they ship their supplies by steamer to Stillwater or\r\nSt. Croix Falls. When landed at Stillwater the supplies are packed\r\nupon flatboats and poled to Taylor's Falls, where they are to be\r\nportaged to the head of the rapids, a distance of six miles, and\r\ntransferred to bateaux. The portage is a difficult one. The goods are\r\nto be hoisted up over the rocks of the Dalles and placed upon sleds\r\ncalculated to run upon the bare ground. Considering the inequalities\r\nof the surface from the Dalles to the head of the rapids, the portage\r\nis an immensely difficult one. They are then taken to their place of\r\ndestination, the bateaux returning to the Falls for successive loads,\r\nthe whole transfer requiring considerable time. Sometimes, if late in\r\nthe season, part or whole of the fleet of bateaux may be caught in the\r\nice, in which case a bushed road must be made, and the supplies\r\ntransported by teams and men.\r\n\r\nArriving on the ground, the operators blaze trees on lines surrounding\r\nthe region which they wish to work during the winter. These claims are\r\ngenerally respected by others. The first work to be done is making a\r\ncamp, building stables, clearing streams of obstructions, and making\r\nroads. Incidentally the Indians, certain to be visitors at the camps,\r\nare to be propitiated with presents of flour, pork and tobacco. These\r\npacified and out of the way, the lumberman may say with Alexander\r\nSelkirk--\r\n\r\n    \"I am monarch of all I survey;\r\n    My right there is none to dispute.\"\r\n\r\nTrespassing is unknown. The lumberman is not conscious that he himself\r\nis a trespasser on the domain of Uncle Sam. Nor is he. Has he not the\r\nbest title in the world? Who is there to dispute it? No government\r\nagent ever troubles him, or questions his right to fell the royal\r\ntrees and dispose of them as he may choose. He is earning by his\r\nstrong right arm his title to the trees. He endures much, accomplishes\r\nmuch and is the advance courier of civilization. He spends long months\r\naway from the common haunts of men. He is cut off from the mails and\r\nfrom home pleasure. He lives an industrious life. Cold is the day when\r\nthe stroke of his axe is not heard. The snow deepens around him, the\r\ntemperature sinks lower and lower, till it would not discredit\r\nLabrador; still he toils on unceasingly, and at night builds high his\r\nblazing fire, wraps himself up in his buffalo robe and blankets, and\r\nsleeps through the night the sleep of the tired and the just.\r\nMeanwhile his appetite is marvelous. The cooking (done by one of the\r\ncrew) maybe of the rudest, and the provisions none of the daintiest,\r\nbut exercise and the cold gives a relish to the food not often found\r\nin the fashionable restaurants. The members of the crew have each\r\nallotted duties. To one is intrusted the cooking department, to\r\nanother the position of teamster, to another that of sled tender;\r\nsome are choppers, some are swampers, some are sawyers. The records of\r\nthe camp are kept by the foreman or some person detailed for that\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nThe winter over, the teams are returned to the settlements. The log\r\ndriving crew succeeds the choppers and other workers. The logs, having\r\nbeen hauled upon the ice of the driving streams, with the melting of\r\nsnow are afloat on the swollen streams, and the drivers commence their\r\nwork, following the logs in their downward course to the mills or\r\nbooms, dislodging them when they are driven upon shore, and breaking\r\njams when they occur. This work is difficult and attended by\r\nconsiderable exposure, as the driver is often obliged to go into the\r\nstream. It therefore commands higher wages than other work. The\r\ndrivers are without tents, but a wangan, or small flat boat,\r\ncontaining bedding, provisions and a cooking kit, is floated down the\r\nstream so as to be convenient at night. The wangan is managed by the\r\ncook alone, and his work, when he ties up for the night, is to take\r\nashore the bedding, cooking material, etc., build a fire and provide a\r\nmeal for the hungry crew. His cooking utensils are of the rudest kind,\r\nconsisting of a tin reflector and a few iron pots and pans. The savory\r\nrepast is scarce finished before the arrival of the crew, cold, wet,\r\ntired, and hungry. They are not particular about a table with its\r\nfurniture, but are satisfied to eat from a tin plate, sitting or lying\r\non the ground. Hunger satisfied, they spend their evenings by the\r\nblazing fire, drying their clothing, jesting, story telling, or\r\nrecalling the events of the day, or scanning the open or clouded sky\r\nfor indications of weather changes. When the sky is clear they trace\r\nthe constellations, locate the principal stars and planets, or follow\r\nthe devious windings of the milky way. Some of them have studied\r\nastronomy, and some have learned from others, and all are intent,\r\nthough without books or teachers, on learning the wisdom that Nature\r\nteaches, and some are found who have learned to look \"from Nature up\r\nto Nature's God.\"\r\n\r\nOccasionally some rougher specimen mars the order and pleasantness of\r\nthis wild-wood converse by an oath or coarse remark, heard, perhaps,\r\nbut unheeded by the more serious and thoughtful. Such men are found\r\neverywhere, in the streets, saloons, and even in the wilderness, men\r\nwho pollute the air in which they move with profanity and obscenity.\r\nThese are not the men who succeed and build up great fortunes; these\r\nare not the true conquerors of the wilderness. The sober, thoughtful\r\nman is the man who succeeds. It is not necessary that he have the\r\nlearning acquired from books, or a smattering of science from the\r\nschools. He may acquire great knowledge by close study of men, and\r\nobservation of the phenomena of nature, and so make himself a peer of\r\nthe book worm and scholar of the library and schools.\r\n\r\nThe acquaintances formed in these camp scenes and toils often result\r\nin life long friendships, and the scenes of camp, river and forest\r\nbecome cherished reminiscences to the actors, who are as fond of\r\nrecalling them as veteran soldiers are of recounting the hairbreadth\r\nescapes and stirring incidents of campaign life.\r\n\r\nThe drive ends with the delivery of the logs at the booms and mills,\r\nthe men are paid off and devote themselves for the remainder of the\r\nsummer to other work.\r\n\r\n\r\nLUMBERING ON THE ST. CROIX IN 1886.\r\n\r\nThe St. Croix lumberman, after the lapse of nearly fifty years, is\r\nstill a picturesque figure, clad, as he is, in coarse, strong woolen\r\ngarments, these of brilliant red, yellow, blue and green, or in some\r\ncases as variegated as Joseph's coat of many colors. He is usually a\r\nman of stalwart frame, which is set off to advantage by his close\r\nfitting garments. His circumstances are, however, widely different\r\nfrom his old time predecessor.\r\n\r\nThe rough, hard work of the wilderness, including the building of\r\ndams, the construction of reservoirs and roads, and the improvement of\r\nthe streams, has been accomplished chiefly by his predecessors. He is\r\nabundantly supplied with food, produced almost in the neighborhood of\r\nthe scenes of his winter's work. He travels by rail almost to his\r\ndestination or drives blooded teams over comparatively good roads,\r\nwhere his predecessors tediously blazed the way and cleared it of\r\nunderbrush. His camp accommodations are far superior. He is housed in\r\ncomfortable cabins, warmed with large stoves and heaters, whereas the\r\ncabin of the lumberman of 1845 had a fire built on the ground in the\r\ncentre of the room. The modern camp is well furnished with tables and\r\nother conveniences. The cook has a separate room furnished with a\r\ncooking stove and modern appliances for cooking. He has his assistant,\r\nknown as the \"cookee\" or second cook. The table is spread with a\r\nvariety of food, and delicacies that would have astounded the\r\nlumberman of 1845. Each operator is limited to his own special work.\r\nHis bounds are set and he can go no further, except at the risk of the\r\nloss of his labor.\r\n\r\nThe work goes on with clock-like precision and is comparatively easy.\r\nEverything is done on a larger scale and more economically. The crews\r\nare larger and the life is not near so solitary. The various crews\r\nemployed for the spring drive combine and thereby greatly increase\r\ntheir efficiency. They are supplied with better and covered boats. The\r\ncook in the drive has in addition to his \"cookee\" a wangan man to\r\nassist in managing the boat. The drives are larger and yet more easily\r\nhandled, the conveniences are greater and the expenses less. The men\r\nare more independent, and owing to the number employed, and the\r\nnearness of settlements and villages, more sociable, and possibly more\r\nhilarious and less thoughtful. We shall nevertheless find among them\r\nmen of character, thoughtful, industrious and earnest men, who would\r\nhave shone in the associations of the earlier camps and who will\r\ndoubtless in the future be ranked among the successful and capable\r\nmen, worthy successors of the veterans now leaving the stage of\r\naction.\r\n\r\nConjecture as to the future of the lumbering industry, and\r\nconsequently as to the character of the men engaged in it, would be\r\nidle. Who can tell what a day or another fifty years may bring forth?\r\nThe pine woods will not last always; already the camps are being\r\npushed further and further to the north and west, and whereever the\r\ndenuded pine lands are arable the farmer is making his home. The\r\nlumbering industry is also passing into the hands of corporations, and\r\nwith their extensive means and the armies of men employed by them the\r\nforests are disappearing more rapidly than ever. It is possible that\r\nthe present generation of lumbermen may be the last in the valley of\r\nthe St. Croix, and that before another fifty years have passed the\r\nlast of the number may have shouldered his axe or peavy and passed\r\n\"over the divide.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LOG JAMS OF THE ST. CROIX.\r\n\r\nThe St. Croix river in its passage through the Dalles is compressed\r\ninto a comparatively narrow channel, by which means the logs driven\r\ndown the stream are crowded closely together, so closely as to\r\nsometimes become firmly wedged or jammed together. The jam generally\r\noccurs at a point known as Angle Rock, a huge promontory of massive\r\ntrap rock extending into the middle of the channel from the Minnesota\r\nside, and opposite to the St. Croix landing. The river makes a bend\r\naround this rock nearly at a right angle with the channel above. At\r\nthis point jams are, under certain conditions, almost inevitable.\r\nSometimes they are of small dimensions and are easily broken.\r\nSometimes the logs gather in such quantity and become so tightly\r\nwedged that it is a labor of weeks to break them.\r\n\r\nThe first jam worthy of note occurred in 1865, during the prevalence\r\nof high water. It is, in fact, only during high water that jams can\r\noccur, the current being at such time swift and strong, and the logs\r\napt to accumulate in greater number than in the regular drives, from\r\nthe fact that logs that have been stranded in former seasons or at low\r\nwater are floated off, and the river is thus filled with logs from\r\nbank to bank. These are crowded into the narrow channel of the Dalles\r\nfaster than they can be discharged, and a jam results. An obstruction\r\nonce formed, the logs continuing to come in from above fill the\r\nchannel. The tide of logs arrested, crowd downward until they rest\r\nupon the bottom of the river, and are heaped upward sometimes to a\r\nheight of twenty or thirty feet above the surface. The river thus\r\nchecked in its course rises, wedging the logs more closely and heaping\r\nthem higher.\r\n\r\nIn the jam of 1865 the river channel was filled nearly to the St.\r\nCroix dam, a distance of a mile and a quarter above Angle Rock. This\r\nbeing the first of the great jams excited unusual attention.\r\nExcursionists came up daily in the boats to look upon it. It was\r\nindeed a wonderful sight. The logs were heaped together in the wildest\r\nconfusion, and wedged in at all angles. Men and horses were employed\r\nto break the jam, which at that time, owing to the inexperience of the\r\nworkers, was no light task. The _modus operandi_ of jam breaking is to\r\nremove logs from the lower part of the jam till some log which serves\r\nas a key to the jam is reached. This being removed the logs above\r\ncommence moving, and, if the haul be a long one, in a short time the\r\nmovement is extended to the head of the jam. Perhaps the logs are so\r\nheaped above that no water is visible. It matters not; the tremendous\r\ncurrent beneath sweeps downward, carrying the logs along, and the\r\nspectator beholds a wonderful scene, a river of logs, the current\r\nswiftest in the centre of the stream, the logs rolling, tumbling,\r\ncrashing, grinding, sometimes snapped in sunder like pipestems. The\r\njam breakers are in the wildest excitement, cheering and hurrahing,\r\nand some may be seen out in the current of logs, jumping from one to\r\nanother, or making their escape to the shore. Others on the lower part\r\nof the jam at the moment of breaking are carried down the river.\r\nThough apparently a scene of great danger, comparatively few accidents\r\noccur. The workers are cool, experienced men with steady nerves and\r\nstalwart arms, a race of men not surpassed for muscular development.\r\n\r\nIn 1877 another jam took place nearly as large as that of 1865. This\r\njam came near destroying the beautiful bridge that spanned the river\r\nat the head of the Dalles. Many of the logs carried high in air by the\r\npressure of the logs below struck the bridge, and at times its\r\ndestruction seemed inevitable. This bridge has since been replaced by\r\nan iron structure, much higher than the first, but even this\r\noccasionally received a blow from some log carried along by the\r\ncurrent at a \"present arms.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1883 another jam of considerable dimensions occurred, but it was\r\nremoved with less labor and expense than its predecessors, and\r\nsteamboats anchored below were used to aid in breaking it. It cost\r\nfrom $5,000 to $10,000 to break these jams.\r\n\r\nBy far the greatest of the jams occurred in June, 1886. The water was\r\nhigh, the current strong and the river above so full of logs that a\r\nlog driver might have crossed upon them. This abundance was owing to\r\nother causes than those mentioned in the account of the jam of 1865.\r\nThe dams at Snake, Kettle and other rivers had been simultaneously\r\nopened, and the logs in these streams all set free at once in the\r\ncurrent of the St. Croix. On they came in long procession with but\r\nlittle obstruction till they reached Angle Rock, where they were\r\nsuddenly arrested, and, owing to the force of the current, wedged more\r\ntightly and heaped higher than on any previous occasion, and the river\r\nchannel was filled with logs to a point two miles above the St. Croix\r\nfalls formerly known as the dam. To break this jam, two steamers, two\r\nengines, several teams of horses and over two hundred men were\r\nemployed, and during the six weeks that occurred before it was broken,\r\nthousands of visitors came by rail and steamboat to look upon it. This\r\njam was estimated to hold during its continuance 150,000,000 feet of\r\nlogs.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOPULATION OF WISCONSIN.\r\n\r\nThe first census of the Northwest Territory, taken in 1790, does not\r\nshow the population of the region now known as Wisconsin. The census\r\nof 1800 gave the following figures: Ohio, 45,363; Indiana Territory,\r\n5,641; Green Bay, 50; Prairie du Chien, 65. According to the census of\r\n1880, the original Northwest Territory contained a population of\r\n12,989,571, or more than one-quarter of the population of the United\r\nStates. The population of Crawford county in 1820 was 492; in 1830,\r\n692; in 1834, 810; in 1836, 1,220; in 1838, 850; in 1841, 1,503; in\r\n1847, 1,409.\r\n\r\nIn 1836, when Wisconsin Territory was organized, the population of the\r\nTerritory was, 11,883. The whole number of votes cast at the election\r\nin 1836 was 2,462. The population, according to the census taken at\r\nthe close of every five years, was as follows: In 1840, 30,945; in\r\n1845, 155,275; in 1850, 305,301; in 1855, 552,109; in 1860, 775,881;\r\nin 1865, 868,325; in 1870, 1,054,670; in 1875, 1,236,729; in 1880,\r\n1,315,480; in 1885, 1,563,423.\r\n\r\nThe official compilation of the census of Wisconsin gives the\r\nfollowing details: Total population, 1,563,423; white, males, 806,342;\r\nfemales, 748,810; negroes, in full, 5,576; Indians, 2,695.

At the time the Territory was organized,\r\nhowever (June 1, 1849), the _permanent_ seat of government had not\r\nbeen determined on, and the money was therefore not available. The\r\nCentral House in St. Paul, a log tavern weather-boarded, situated at\r\nthe corner of Bench and Minnesota streets, where the rear of the\r\nMannheimer block now is, was rented for the public offices and\r\nlegislative assembly. It was for some months known as \"The Capitol.\"\r\nOn the lower floor was the secretary of state's office, and the house\r\nof representatives chamber. On the second floor was the council\r\nchamber and the territorial library. Neither of these legislative\r\nhalls was over sixteen or eighteen feet square. The rest of the\r\nbuilding was used as an inn. The Union colors, floating from a flag\r\nstaff on the bank in front of the building, was the only mark of its\r\nrank. During his entire term of office, Gov. Ramsey kept the executive\r\noffice in his private residence, and the supreme court met in rented\r\nchambers here and there.\r\n\r\nOn Sept. 3, 1849, the first session of the legislature assembled at\r\nthe above temporary capitol. Gov. Ramsey delivered his message to the\r\ntwo houses in joint convention assembled, in the hotel dining room.\r\nThe whole fitting of the assembly rooms was of the plainest\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nConsiderable discussion ensued during the session on this subject, as\r\nto whether the Territory had a right to expend the $20,000\r\nappropriated in the organic act, for a capitol building. The question\r\nhaving been submitted to Hon. Wm. Meredith, secretary of the treasury,\r\nhe replied that the \"Department can not doubt that the public\r\nbuildings in question can only be erected at the _permanent_ seat of\r\ngovernment, located as described.\"\r\n\r\nThe second session assembled Jan. 2, 1851, in a brick building, since\r\nburned, which occupied the site of the Third street front of the\r\nMetropolitan Hotel. At this session the seat of government was fixed\r\nat St. Paul, as above noted. D. F. Brawley, Jonathan McKusick, Louis\r\nRobert and E. A. C. Hatch were elected building commissioners. Charles\r\nBazille, a pioneer resident and large property owner of St. Paul,\r\ndonated to the government the block of ground since known as \"Capitol\r\nSquare,\" and plans drawn by N. C. Prentiss were adopted. The contract\r\nwas let to Joseph Daniels for $33,000, but the building finally cost\r\nover $40,000. It was commenced at once, but not completed until the\r\nsummer of 1853. The third and fourth sessions of the legislature were\r\ncompelled, therefore, to meet in rented buildings. That of 1852\r\nassembled in Goodrich's block on Third street below Jackson, and that\r\nof 1853 in a two story brick row on Third street, where the front of\r\nthe Mannheimer block now is.\r\n\r\n\r\nBURNING OF THE CAPITOL.\r\n\r\nAt nine o'clock on the evening of March 1, 1881, while both houses of\r\nthe legislature were in session, and all the halls and departments\r\nwere crowded with visitors, the dome of the building was found to be\r\non fire. The flames spread with too great rapidity to be checked, and\r\nall that could be done was to save the contents of the building. The\r\nmost valuable records and papers of the various offices, and of the\r\nlegislature, with some of the furniture, were carried out, but the\r\ngreater part of the contents of the building, including the valuable\r\nlaw library, the supply of state laws, documents and reports, and all\r\nthe stationery in the secretary of state's store rooms, etc., were a\r\ntotal loss. The Historical Society's library was mostly saved. The\r\nentire loss to the State was fully $200,000.\r\n\r\nFortunately the city of St. Paul had just completed a fine and\r\nspacious market house, which was still unoccupied, and its use was at\r\nonce tendered the State by the city authorities, and while the flames\r\nwere still burning the furniture and effects saved from the old\r\ncapitol were removed thither. At nine o'clock next morning the state\r\ndepartments and both houses of the legislature were again at work in\r\ntheir new quarters. But two days of the session yet remained. Gov.\r\nPillsbury immediately secured estimates for rebuilding the burned\r\nedifice, using the old walls, and an act appropriating $75,000 for\r\nthat purpose was passed. Work was commenced at once. It was then found\r\nthat the old walls were too unsafe to use, and at the extra session in\r\nSeptember, 1881, the further sum of $100,000 was appropriated for the\r\ncompletion of the building. Its total cost was about $275,000. The\r\ndome of the building is two hundred feet above the ground, giving a\r\nnoble view to the visitor who ascends it. The exterior of the edifice\r\nis neat and tasty, and it is altogether creditable to the State,\r\nconsidering its comparatively small cost.\r\n\r\n\r\nSELKIRK VISITORS.\r\n\r\nIn the early days a somewhat primitive people inhabited the Northwest,\r\nmaking their homes on the banks of the Red River of the North and on\r\nthe shores of Winnipeg, in what was known as the Selkirk settlement,\r\nnow included in the province of Manitoba. They were a mixed race of\r\nScotch, French and Indian stock, born and raised under the government\r\nof the Northwest British Fur Company. They were a peaceable, partly\r\npastoral and partly nomadic, trading people. They cultivated the\r\nground quite successfully considering the high latitude of their home\r\nand the absence of machinery for farm work, raising wheat, vegetables,\r\ncattle and horses. They engaged in hunting and trapping and yearly\r\nvisited St. Paul with the surplus products of their labor to be\r\ndisposed of for money or goods. They came usually in caravans\r\nconsisting of files of carts drawn by cows, oxen and ponies, and\r\ncommanded by a captain elected to the position who exercised over them\r\na rigid military rule. Their carts were rude, creaking affairs, made\r\nentirely without iron, all the fastenings being sinews and leathern\r\nthongs. This harness was made of raw hides, Indian tanned, and sewed\r\nwith animal sinews. Their costume was a happy cross between the\r\ncivilized and savage. Their caravans included from 100 to 600 carts,\r\nwhich were laden with furs, buffalo robes, buffalo tongues, dried\r\npemmican, etc. As they came a distance of 450 miles, the journey\r\nrequired many days, but was made in good military order. The raising\r\nof a flag was the signal for starting, the lowering, for stopping. At\r\nnight the carts were ranged in a circle about the encampment, and\r\nsentinels posted. Their encampment within the suburbs of St. Paul\r\nattracted great crowds of the curious. In 1857 their train consisted\r\nof 500 carts, and in 1858 of 600, but later, as railroads were built\r\nnorthward and steamers were placed upon the Red River of the North,\r\ntheir number gradually diminished and finally their visits ceased\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\n\r\nCYCLONES.\r\n\r\nRecorded and unrecorded, Minnesota and Wisconsin have had their full\r\nshare of those atmospheric disturbances that have wrought so much\r\ndestruction in the Western States. In the early days, when the country\r\nwas sparsely settled and villages and towns were few and far between,\r\nthey came and went unnoted, or attracting but little attention. They\r\nleft no traces on the plain, and in the forests only a belt of fallen\r\ntimber, known as a \"windfall.\" These belts are sufficiently numerous\r\nto establish the fact that these storms were probably as frequent in\r\nearly, even in prehistoric, times as at the present. Their movements\r\nare more destructive in later times because of the improvements of\r\ncivilization, the increased number of human habitations and the growth\r\nof towns and cities. The tornado has more to destroy, and as a\r\ndestroying agent, its movements are better known and more widely\r\npublished.\r\n\r\nScientists are not agreed as to the cause of these destructive\r\nphenomena, but enough is known to overthrow the theory so persistently\r\nadvanced that it is in consequence of the cutting away of the forests\r\nand the substitution of farms. In fact much of the country was already\r\nprairie land and abundant evidences of tornadoes are found in the\r\nmidst of old forests in which have since grown up trees of\r\nconsiderable size, and this at a period long before the lumberman\r\ncommenced his destructive work.\r\n\r\nWe append a few sketches of cyclones that have occurred in\r\ncomparatively recent times.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ISANTI COUNTY CYCLONE.\r\n\r\nThis storm occurred in September, 1865, and spent its fury chiefly in\r\nIsanti county, but extended beyond and was felt even in Wisconsin.\r\nThe tornado gathered its wrath in the southwestern region of Isanti\r\ncounty, in what is called the \"Lake Typo settlement,\" some forty miles\r\nnorth of St. Paul. It was first discovered in the shape of \"two\r\nclouds,\" as the people there residing expressed it, \"approaching each\r\nother from different directions.\" Suddenly the mingling of these\r\ncounter currents of strong winds appeared to form the blackened\r\nheavens into a funnel-shaped mass. The direction of the whirlwind was\r\nfrom southwest to northeast, and after crossing the St. Croix river\r\npassed through an unsettled portion of timber lands known as \"pine\r\nbarrens,\" a growth of scattering pines interspersed with black oaks of\r\nmedium size.\r\n\r\nOn Wood river, Burnett county, Wisconsin, the trunks of pine trees,\r\nthree feet in diameter and eighty feet high, were twisted into \"broom\r\nsplints\" and carried high in air. The intervening oaks were also\r\nserved the same way; and the whole track of the tornado, from thirty\r\nrods to three-fourths of a mile in width, had left no tree standing.\r\nPines and oaks were all prostrate, and promiscuously heaped up in\r\nwinrows over the ground, their branches and trunks interlocked, and in\r\nsome places piled to the height of thirty feet.\r\n\r\nThe author of this work lost about 10,000,000 feet of pine logs in\r\nWood river in this cyclone. On Clam river, Wisconsin, for four miles\r\nin length and about half a mile in width, the forest was laid in\r\nwinrows, and parties who came through soon after the tempest had to\r\ncut their way.\r\n\r\nThe tornado, traveling with the velocity of lightning to the\r\nnortheast, overtook Dr. Comfort, of Wyoming, as he was crossing\r\nSunrise prairie with a mule team, accompanied by a hired man. The\r\ndoctor and man saved themselves by clinging to some shrubs near by,\r\nbut when the fury of the whirlwind had passed, all they could find of\r\ntheir outfit was the poor mules, half frightened to death, and the\r\nfore wheels and tongue of the wagon. The hind wheels, box, and the\r\nrest of the outfit, together with the doctor's medicine kit, which he\r\nhad along, when last seen, were bound zenithward.\r\n\r\nWm. A. Hobbs, late quartermaster sergeant of the Third Minnesota\r\nBattery, Light Artillery, and Orville Grant and brother--sons of R.\r\nGrant, Esq., a farmer living in Isanti county--were out hunting, and\r\nhappened to be caught where the storm passed through the heaviest\r\ntimber. They saw it approaching, and at first attempted to take\r\nshelter in an old school house near by, but soon saw that was no place\r\nfor them and made for an old pine log which they got behind; soon that\r\ncommenced to move. Hobbs seized hold of an oak, some ten inches in\r\ndiameter, which immediately commenced to be loosened at the roots and\r\nto spin around like a top. The tree was prostrated and he with it--he\r\nreceiving very severe injuries. The Grant boys, were also injured, but\r\nnone near so badly as Hobbs. The log school house shared the fate of\r\nthe surrounding forest. A resident near by states that he saw one-half\r\nthe roof sailing upward at least four hundred feet above the tops of\r\nthe tallest trees.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COTTAGE GROVE CYCLONE.\r\n\r\nOn June 15, 1877, a terrific cyclone visited the town of Cottage\r\nGrove, Washington county, Minnesota. We append the correct and vivid\r\ndescription taken from the \"History of Washington County:\"\r\n\r\n\"At 9 o'clock P. M. there arose in the southwest a dark and heavy\r\ncloud, attended with loud thunder, vivid lightning and a strong wind.\r\nThe cloud moved forward rapidly; soon the rain began to fall in\r\ntorrents, when suddenly the wind came dashing with great violence,\r\nsweeping everything before it. There seemed to be two currents of\r\nwind, one coming from the west and the other from the southwest. These\r\ntwo currents came together in section 22. The stronger current being\r\nfrom the southwest, the storm took a northwestern direction, and did\r\nsome damage in section 27, taking away a portion of the roof of Ethan\r\nViall's house, and a trunk out of the chamber, no trace of which could\r\nbe found. A corn cultivator was taken up, some portions of which were\r\nnever found, while other parts were found two miles from the place of\r\nits taking. In section 22, when the currents met, the destruction of\r\nproperty beggars description. The timber in its track was prostrated;\r\nfences were torn up and scattered in every direction; E. Welch's house\r\ncame in the line of desolation; Mr. and Mrs. Welch had stepped out to\r\nlook after some chickens in which Mrs. Welch was specially interested,\r\nand, startled by the roar of the wind, were in the act of returning to\r\nthe house. When near the door the wind took up the house, bearing it\r\naway, and a stick of timber struck both Mr. and Mrs. Welch, knocking\r\nthem down. When Mr. Welch recovered he had hold of his wife, but she\r\nwas dead. The stick of timber struck her on the head and caused\r\ninstant death. The next object in the path of destruction was C. D.\r\nTuttle's two story dwelling, located in the northwest corner of\r\nsection 26. The main part of the house was torn to pieces and\r\nscattered in every direction, while the wing was left unmoved. The\r\nfamily, consisting of six persons, fled to the cellar and were\r\nmiraculously preserved. The large barn a few rods further on was\r\ncompletely destroyed. Next in its course was Mr. J. C. Tucker's barn,\r\nthe roof of which suddenly passed along on the breeze. At this point\r\nthe storm turned, taking a northeasterly direction, and struck the\r\nhouse of Robert Williams, damaging the house and entirely destroying\r\nthe barn. A horse tied to a girder in the barn was found, uninjured,\r\nsixty feet outside of the limits of the building, with the girder\r\nlying across him, and the strap still tied to it. Next in line was a\r\nsmall lake in the southwest corner of section 23. It was almost robbed\r\nof its treasure. The water and mud was carried a long distance up the\r\nbluffs, fifty feet above the level of the lake. Next came the fine\r\nhouse of John Morey, giving a portion of its roof to the excited wind;\r\nthen passed into the town of Denmark, continuing its destructive\r\ncourse, killing a horse for W. G. Wagner, near the town line. A man\r\nknown as Michael Schull, a farm hand, was taken up by the wind and\r\ndashed against a pile of wood, injuring his brain, causing him to\r\nbecome dangerous. He is now at St. Peter in the insane asylum. The\r\ndestruction of property was great. No accurate account of the amount\r\nof damage done has been compiled. Mr. Tuttle, living in section 26,\r\nsuffered the most. He estimated his loss at $7,000. His house was\r\nsituated in a valley surrounded by oak trees, and we would suppose was\r\nprotected by the strong bulwarks of Nature, and yet house, barn,\r\nfarming utensils, and machinery were scattered over the country. The\r\nnext morning sheets of tin two feet square, found in Mr. Tuttle's\r\nyard, were supposed to have come from a church in Dakota county.\r\nPortions of Mr. Tuttle's house were found miles away.\"\r\n\r\nThe same cyclone visited Lake Elmo and did great damage, blowing down\r\nthe depot buildings, Lake Elmo Hotel and other structures. The\r\nbuildings and trees of the agricultural fair grounds were destroyed.\r\nSome parts of the buildings were carried miles away by the storm.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CYCLONE AT WHITE BEAR AND MARINE, MINNESOTA, AND CLEAR LAKE,\r\nWISCONSIN.\r\n\r\nSept. 9, 1884, a storm arose in Hennepin county and did some damage;\r\ncontinuing to White Bear lake, Oneka and Grant, in Washington county,\r\nit gathered force and proved very destructive to life and property. As\r\nit passed through Oneka and Grant its path was about ten miles in\r\nwidth. Churches, school houses, dwellings, barns, grain stacks, and\r\nfences in its way were either partially or wholly destroyed, and the\r\nwrecked property was distributed for miles around. The cyclone passed\r\non over Marine, Big Lake and Scandia, crossed the St. Croix, passed\r\nover the town of Somerset, Star Prairie, New Richmond, in St. Croix\r\ncounty, and over Black Brook, Clear Lake, Pineville and Clayton in\r\nPolk county and Turtle Lake in Barron, pursuing the usual\r\nnortheasterly direction common to these cyclones, and disappearing in\r\nterrific thunderstorms, in the timbered lands of Barron and Chippewa\r\ncounties. An eye witness, Mr. Ivory Hatch, of Oneka, thus describes\r\nthe approach of the storm:\r\n\r\n\"I was standing near a shed in the barnyard, when suddenly the sky\r\nbecame black and threatening. In about five minutes I saw two\r\nfunnel-shaped clouds descend and approach each other. I started for\r\nthe house to warn my family, when, as quick as a flash, I was\r\nenveloped in the cloud, and while clinging to a post for safety my\r\ngrain stacks and buildings disappeared. The storm did not continue\r\nover a minute and a half. I escaped almost miraculously without a\r\nbruise.\" The testimony of others in the neighborhood is substantially\r\nthe same. In the town of Oneka the destruction was worse than in any\r\nother locality.\r\n\r\nIn the track of the storm through Washington county not less than\r\nfifty houses were demolished. The loss on each averaged $600, making a\r\ntotal of $30,000. Losses on barns, machinery and stock raised this sum\r\nto $50,000. The loss at Marine was computed roughly at $75,000, which\r\nmade a total of $135,000, not including hay and grain. The entire loss\r\nto Clear Lake was estimated at $200,000. Three persons lost their\r\nlives, Mrs. P. Burdick, Willie Kavanagh and John Saunders. The\r\nMethodist, Congregational and Swedish churches were leveled with the\r\nground. The timber losses were close to $1,000,000; private property\r\nin villages, loss near $500,000, and all other losses, such as farm\r\nproperty and the like, in the hundred thousands. The total loss in\r\nWisconsin has been placed at six lives and $4,000,000 in property.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ST. CLOUD AND SAUK RAPIDS CYCLONE OF 1886.\r\n\r\nThe most destructive storm yet recorded occurred on the afternoon of\r\nApril 14, 1886. The clouds were first seen from St. Cloud to gather a\r\nshort distance over the basin of the Masour cemetery about three\r\no'clock, Sunday afternoon, in dark, overhanging masses. Then sharp\r\ntongues of lightning darted down with terrific force, and the storm\r\nwith all its fury burst upon the doomed cities. The south end, or\r\nbeginning of the cyclone track, was located two or three miles south\r\nand a little west of St. Cloud and its total length was twenty-four\r\nmiles. The property destroyed amounted to over a quarter of a million\r\nof dollars, and the loss of life at St. Cloud and Sauk Rapids was\r\nseventy-five. If we include those who died later of injuries from\r\nwounds, exposure and fright, we may safely say a hundred.\r\n\r\nThe first victim of the cyclone was Nicholas Junneman. The cyclone\r\nrising, as we have said, over or near Calvary cemetery, for a space of\r\nabout three hundred yards in diameter the trees were uprooted or\r\ntwisted off, gravestones were thrown flat, and fences demolished.\r\nCrossing over Calvary Hill, in a path about one hundred feet wide, it\r\nwrecked the small Catholic chapel and badly injured the crucifix\r\nlocated there. Next in its course was the farm house of Nicholas\r\nJunneman which was left a pile of ruins, and Mr. Junneman was killed,\r\nwhile his wife was dangerously injured. The first house struck within\r\nthe city limits was J. W. Tenvoorde's. Just across the street J.\r\nSchwartz's two story brick house was almost wrecked. Here the path of\r\nthe tornado was about two hundred feet wide, and increased until by\r\nthe time it reached the Manitoba depot the width was six hundred feet,\r\ntaking in in its fearful embrace during the length of its course half\r\na hundred or more buildings, which were totally wrecked, moved from\r\ntheir foundations, or more or less damaged. In many instances there\r\nwas nothing left to show where a house had stood, and the prairie was\r\ncovered far and wide with the debris of the demolished buildings. Over\r\nfifty houses in St. Cloud were totally destroyed and as many more\r\nbadly damaged. Before striking the river it swerved slightly\r\nnorthward, and thus the costly building blocks and crowded streets in\r\nthe heart of the city were spared. Had the cyclone veered in its\r\ncourse more to the south, the loss of property and life in St. Cloud\r\nwould have been incalculable.\r\n\r\nStriking the river the cyclone appeared to be almost motionless for a\r\nfew moments, or moved so slowly as to seem to hang over the face of\r\nthe water, its huge black column rising toward the zenith. Then\r\nleaving the river, this monster of the air struck Sauk Rapids at\r\nStanton's large flouring mill, which was left a heap of ruins. It then\r\ntook Demeules' store and the Northern Pacific depot, and passed on\r\nthrough the main business part of the place, leaving but one important\r\nbusiness house standing, Wood's store, which was badly damaged. Court\r\nhouse, church, school building, post office, newspaper offices,\r\nhotels, dwelling houses, all went down under the relentless power of\r\nthe storm. Streets were blockaded with the wreck so as to be\r\npractically impassable. The list of dead out of a village of about\r\n1,000 population included some of the leading county officials and\r\nprominent citizens. Amongst them were John Renard, county auditor, and\r\nGregg Lindley, register of deeds; also Edgar Hull, president of the\r\nGerman-American National Bank; E. G. Halbert, of the New York\r\nInsurance Company, with whom Mr. Hull had just filed an application\r\nfor a $5,000 policy, was so badly injured that he died in a few days.\r\nThe destruction of property in Sauk Rapids was far greater than in St.\r\nCloud, as the business portion of the city was almost entirely swept\r\naway. The loss of life was also proportionately greater.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Sauk Rapids the cyclone struck Rice's, a station on the\r\nNorthern Pacific road, about fourteen miles from the former village.\r\nSome four miles southeast of the station, at the house of a farmer\r\nnamed Schultz, a happy wedding party was gathered, a daughter of the\r\nfarmer having been married to Henry Friday, chairman of the board of\r\nsupervisors of Langola. Almost before they realized it the terrible\r\npower of the storm encircled them, and in the twinkling of an eye nine\r\nof the goodly company were mangled corpses, among the number being the\r\ngroom, while the bride was dangerously if not fatally injured. The\r\nvictims also included the Rev. G. J. Schmidt, pastor of the German\r\nEvangelical church of Sauk Rapids. The Rev. Mr. Seeder, pastor of the\r\nTwo Rivers district, was found out on the prairie with both legs\r\nbroken.\r\n\r\nAt Buckman, Morrison county, several persons were killed, and six or\r\nseven farm houses destroyed. The suffering caused by this most\r\nterrible of cyclones evoked the liveliest sympathy, and large\r\ncontributions of money, food and clothing were forwarded by the\r\ncitizens of St. Paul, Minneapolis and other cities throughout the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nG. W. Benedict, of Sauk Rapids, relates his experience in the storm as\r\nfollows: \"I was in the yard at my residence half a mile north of the\r\ndepot, when I heard a terrible deafening roar, and on looking up I saw\r\nwhat first appeared to be a very heavy black volume of smoke from a\r\nrailroad engine, but in a moment I realized what it was. The volume of\r\nblack cloud soon increased to double its size, and had a funnel shape,\r\ngyrating in a peculiar zigzag form. Untold amounts of debris of\r\nhouses, fences and everything above the surface were shooting and\r\nflying with terrific velocity from the cloud, which took a northerly\r\ndirection. The horrible writhing demon of destruction, with its\r\ndeafening roar, increased in volume and force, and hurled to utter\r\ndestruction everything in its path, a great portion of which was\r\ncarried miles in the air out of sight as though but trifles of\r\nlightest chaff.\"\r\n\r\nThos. Van Etten was walking on the street, going home, when the\r\ncyclone struck the town, and he was bodily lifted into the air,\r\ncarried four hundred feet up a steep hill and landed in a street,\r\nliterally plastered over with mud. A young man fishing near the end of\r\nthe bridge, on the opposite side from Sauk Rapids, says that many of\r\nthe houses were lifted high in the air, and did not seem to be injured\r\nuntil they were dashed to the ground, when they collapsed, and the\r\npieces were scattered in all directions. None of the very large number\r\nof persons who went into a cellar for protection from the storm were\r\nbadly injured. The Fink family, the mother and four children of which\r\nwere almost instantly killed, were in a house which had an excellent\r\ncellar, but the family forgot to utilize it. Near the ruins of the\r\nCarpenter house is a tree about ten inches in diameter, through which\r\na pine board was driven so that it protruded at both sides of the\r\ntree. The property loss in Benton county was estimated at $300,000,\r\nand in St. Cloud at $56,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRUCK BY LIGHTNING.\r\n\r\nSome time in the '50s Messrs. Oaks, Rand, Witham, Carson, and twelve\r\nother men were in a tent on the banks of Lake St. Croix, just below\r\nthe mouth of Willow river, during a severe thunder storm. It was about\r\n9 o'clock P. M. when lightning struck the tent and passing down killed\r\nWitham and Carson, and severely stunned Oaks and Rand. The other men\r\nwere not injured, but, being badly frightened, ran away, and did not\r\nreturn till the following morning, when they found two of the men\r\nsupposed killed still alive, but dazed and motionless. The two killed\r\nwere lying close together, while Mr. Oaks lay upon one side and Mr.\r\nRand upon the other. The lightning had struck the men who were killed\r\nupon the head, and traversing the body had passed out below the\r\nankles. The current of electricity had passed up the arm of Mr. Oaks\r\nand down his body, burning spots the size of a pea, and plowing lines\r\nunder the skin, the scars of which, after recovery, were raised in\r\nwelts nearly as large as a whipcord. Mr. Oaks was nearly a year\r\nrecovering. He says that during the time he lay motionless and\r\napparently stunned he was in full possession of his faculties. Mr.\r\nRand had one side of his body burned to a blister. Prior to this he\r\nhad been affected with weak eyes, but the electrical treatment there\r\nreceived effected a complete cure.\r\n\r\n\r\nASIATIC CHOLERA.\r\n\r\nMinnesota was early visited by this scourge of the eastern world. It\r\nwas brought up the river on the crowded steamers and created the\r\nutmost consternation, and even panic. No one on board the Royal Arch,\r\nMay, 1853, can forget the dreadful scenes upon this boat. The first\r\ncase occurred at Galena, that of a child, and the next at La Crosse,\r\nthat of a woman, who was put ashore in a dying condition twenty miles\r\nabove. From thence to St. Paul the boat was a floating hospital, and\r\nthirteen corpses lay under a canvas on the lower deck.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the ghastly freight carried by the steamer, and its\r\nsick and dying passengers in the cabin above, kind hearts sympathized\r\nand kind hands were extended to help; and the dead were buried and\r\nevery thing possible was done for the sick and suffering survivors,\r\nmany of whom died after being carried ashore at St. Paul. What these\r\ngood Samaritans did was at the risk of their own lives, and more than\r\none, among them Henry P. Pratt, editor of the St. Paul _Minnesotian_,\r\nsickened and died from infection caught by ministering to the stricken\r\nones.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECREE OF CITIZENSHIP.\r\n\r\nThe first naturalization papers on record in Minnesota are somewhat\r\nunique, and for that reason worthy of preservation, and are herewith\r\npresented _et literatim_:\r\n\r\n\r\n     DECREE OF CITIZENSHIP.\r\n\r\n     TERRITORY OF WISCONSIN,\r\n     ST. CROIX COUNTY.\r\n\r\n     I, William Willim, an alien by birth, aged twenty-six years,\r\n     do hereby, upon my oath, make known that I was born in the\r\n     county of Hereford, in the kingdom of Great Britain and\r\n     Ireland, on the twenty-sixth day of June, A. D. 1821; that I\r\n     emigrated from the kingdom aforesaid, and landed in New\r\n     York, in the state of New York, on the first day of October,\r\n     1838; that I was at that time a minor aged seventeen years,\r\n     and that I have since that time resided in the United States\r\n     of America; that it is my _bona fide_ intention to become a\r\n     citizen of the United States, to renounce forever all\r\n     allegiance and fidelity which I, in anywise, owe to any\r\n     foreign power, potentate, state or sovereignty whatever, and\r\n     more particularly all allegiance and fidelity which I, in\r\n     anywise, owe to Victoria, queen of Great Britain, of whom I\r\n     have heretofore been a subject, and, further that I do not\r\n     possess any hereditary title, or belong to any of the order\r\n     of nobility in the kingdom from whence I came; so help me\r\n     God.\r\n\r\n                                               WILLIAM WILLIM.\r\n\r\n     Sworn and subscribed to before me on this eighteenth day of\r\n     June, 1847, in open court.\r\n\r\n                                               JOSEPH R. BROWN,\r\n     _Clerk of District Court of St. Croix County, Wisconsin Territory._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother oath, such as is now administered, to support the constitution\r\nof the United States, was signed and attested in like manner.\r\n\r\n\r\nBURNING OF THE INTERNATIONAL HOTEL.\r\n\r\nOn a clear, cold night in February, 1869, the International Hotel,\r\nlocated at the corner of Seventh and Jackson streets, took fire and\r\nwas speedily consumed. The alarm was sounded at two o'clock in the\r\nmorning. The hotel was crowded with boarders, among whom were many\r\nmembers of the legislature, then in session, and their families. The\r\nwriter occupied a room on the second floor and was among the first\r\naroused. Hastily seizing my trunk I hurried down stairs and returned\r\nto assist others, but was stopped by the smoke at the entrance. The\r\nguests of the house were pouring from every outlet. A group of ladies\r\nhad escaped to the sidewalk, partly clad, some with bare feet. Ladders\r\nwere placed to the windows to save those who had failed to escape in\r\nthe hallway. Senators C. A. Gilman and Seagrave Smith, with their\r\nwives, were rescued in this manner. Many diverting circumstances\r\noccurred illustrative of nonchalance, coolness and daring, as well as\r\nof bewilderment and panic.\r\n\r\nSenator Armstrong tried in vain to throw his trunk from a window in\r\nwhich it was wedged fast and was obliged to leave it to the flames.\r\nJudge Meeker came out of the house carrying his clothing upon his arm,\r\nhaving a shawl wrapped round his head, and bewailing the loss of the\r\nmaps and charts of Meeker's dam. Seagrave Smith tarried too long\r\nsearching for a senate bill, and narrowly escaped sharing the fate of\r\nthe bill. Many of the guests escaped in their night clothing, and\r\ncarrying their clothing with them completed their toilet standing in\r\nthe snow in the light of the burning building. Considering the\r\nrapidity of the fire, and the hour at which it occurred it seemed\r\nmarvelous that no lives were lost.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRASSHOPPERS.\r\n\r\nMinnesota has been visited at intervals by that scourge of some of the\r\nWestern States, grasshoppers. The first visitation was from the\r\nSelkirk (now Manitoba) settlement, about 1838-9. The pests are said to\r\nhave accompanied some of the early immigrants from Selkirk who came\r\ndown to the reservation about Fort Snelling. They made yearly\r\nvisitations and threatened to become a serious obstacle to the\r\nsettlement of the country. Some seasons they proved quite destructive.\r\nIn 1874-5-6-7 the state legislature made appropriations to relieve\r\nthose suffering from their ravages in the western and southwestern\r\nparts of the State. There were also large private contributions to the\r\nrelief fund. One of the acts passed at the session of 1877\r\nappropriated $100,000 for bounties to pay for the destruction of\r\ngrasshoppers and their eggs. Townships and villages were also\r\nauthorized to levy taxes for the destruction of the common enemy, and\r\n$75,000 was appropriated to furnish seed grain for those who had lost\r\ntheir crops, and $5,000 was voted for a common relief fund. Special\r\nprayers were offered for an abatement of the scourge. In 1877, when\r\nthe grasshopper appeared in myriads again, the governor appointed a\r\nday of fasting and prayer for riddance from the calamity. From some\r\nunknown cause the grasshoppers disappeared, and have not since\r\nreturned in such numbers as to prove a plague. These grasshoppers were\r\na species known as the Rocky Mountain locusts.\r\n\r\n\r\nANCIENT MOUNDS.\r\n\r\nThe valley of the Mississippi and the valleys of its tributary streams\r\nabound with mounds of various sizes and fashions, circular, oval or\r\noblong, serpentine and sometimes irregular in outline, and all works\r\nof intelligence and design, wrought by some ancient people for\r\npurposes now not fully known. It is probable, however, that some were\r\nused as places of defense, others were built for sacrificial or\r\nreligious purposes, others for sepulture, and others still may be the\r\nremains of dwellings. Most of them contain relics, coins or implements\r\nmade of shells, of flints and in some instances of baked earthenware,\r\nand lastly human remains. These relics are not necessarily of\r\ncotemporaneous date, and many of them are comparatively modern. Such\r\nmounds were used for burial places long after their original builders\r\nhad passed away.\r\n\r\nThat they are very ancient is unquestionable. They outdate the\r\ntraditions of the Indians who inhabited this country at the date of\r\nits discovery, while the most ancient remains taken from them indicate\r\nas their builders a people widely different from the present\r\naborigines, and possessed of arts unknown to them. Conjecture points\r\nto a race from the South, probably the Aztecs, as the mound builders.\r\nThis race was exterminated in some way, or driven away by some\r\nstronger tribes, who may in turn have given place to our present race\r\nof Indians. A full description of these ancient works would require\r\nvolumes; we can therefore allude only to a few that may be considered\r\ntypical specimens of their class.\r\n\r\nAt Prairie Village, now Waukesha, Wisconsin, in 1836, the writer saw a\r\nmound six feet high, representing a tortoise, the head, feet and tail\r\nbeing still distinctly traceable. Many mounds exist at Prairie du\r\nChien, some quite large, and of varying shape, some representing\r\ninclosures or fortifications, with gateways or openings. These are\r\nlocated on the high bluffs east of the Prairie. Many of these, very\r\ndistinct in the early days, are now almost obliterated by the\r\nplowshare of the farmer and the spade of the relic hunter.\r\n\r\nThe builders of the ancient mounds certainly exercised great taste in\r\ntheir location, as they are generally found in pleasant localities, on\r\ngrassy plateaus or elevated lands, and by the shores of lakes and\r\nstreams. Some, originally built on plains, have since been overgrown\r\nwith trees. In some cases trees of immense size have been found\r\ngrowing even on the summit of the mounds. The most notable mounds of\r\nthe St. Croix valley are at Vasa village, in Marine township,\r\nWashington county, Minnesota, and in the neighborhood of Osceola\r\nMills, Polk county, Wisconsin. We append notes of a survey of the\r\nlatter, made in 1870. They are sixteen in number and we mention only\r\nthe most remarkable.\r\n\r\nNo. 1 is of circular form, 20 feet in height and 60 in diameter. Trees\r\n2 feet in diameter are found on this mound. Mound No. 2 has a diameter\r\nof 90 feet, and was originally 30 feet high; at present but 20. This\r\nmound is also of circular formation. Mound No. 3 is circular in form,\r\n36 feet in diameter and 2 feet high. Mound No. 4 is circular, 40 feet\r\nin diameter and 5 feet high. Mound No. 5 is oblong and 40×60 feet in\r\ndimensions, and 4 feet high. The largest and finest of these mounds\r\nhave been nearly destroyed by the encroachments of the road makers.\r\nThese mounds are located two miles north of Osceola, on Close creek.\r\nAlanson Thompson made a homestead of the land on which they are\r\nsituated, and built his home immediately in the rear of the two larger\r\nmounds. His garden included many of the mounds.\r\n\r\nMr. T. H. Lewis, of St. Paul, made a later survey of these ancient\r\nmounds. In the group north of the creek and near the school house,\r\nwhich he classifies as the upper group, he finds ninety-six well\r\ndeveloped mounds, and some of them of peculiar shape and great\r\ninterest. In the group south of the creek, which he calls the lower\r\ngroup, he finds forty-nine mounds, a total of one hundred and\r\nforty-five in the two groups; at least five times as many as has been\r\nsupposed to be there.\r\n\r\nBut one of the mounds is an effigy mound, and this is not clearly\r\ndefined, plowing in the field having disturbed the outline of the\r\neffigy. The most of them contain bones, as has long been known, and\r\nMr. Lewis finds in them shell relics, which are rarely found in any\r\nmounds; also pottery, and beads made from shells.\r\n\r\nAnother peculiar mound not included in this description may be found\r\non the bluff overlooking the St. Croix, not far from the Close creek\r\nseries of mounds. It is over one hundred feet in length and serpentine\r\nin form, one end being enlarged to represent the head. There are also\r\nfine specimens of ancient mounds on Chisago lake, near Centre City and\r\nChisago City.\r\n\r\nThe subject is a fascinating one to the archaeologist, but it behooves\r\nhim to make haste with his investigations, as these marvelous works\r\nare rapidly disappearing, being dug over by the irresponsible and\r\nunscientific relic hunter, or worn down by the plow, or carted away\r\nfor loose earth to mend a roadway or fill a sinkhole.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAKE ITASCA.\r\n\r\nThe Mississippi appropriately takes its name at the outlet of Lake\r\nItasca, its reputed source. This lake, although known to the fur\r\ncompany adventurers of the eighteenth, and the early part of the\r\nnineteenth centuries, received the name Itasca in 1832 from\r\nSchoolcraft and Boutwell. A complete account of the naming of the lake\r\nwill be found in the biography of Rev. W. T. Boutwell, attached to the\r\nhistory of Pine county in this work. Itasca lies in range 36,\r\ntownships 133 and 134, and is about three miles in length by one and\r\none-half in width. Its title to the distinction of being the true\r\nsource of the Mississippi has been frequently called in question.\r\nThere are tributary lakes of smaller size lying near it, connected\r\nwith it by small streams, barely navigable for birch canoes. Elk lake,\r\na body of water three-fourths of a mile in length, lying south, is\r\nconnected with it by a stream 25 links wide and 30 rods in length.\r\nElk lake has an influent stream 2 miles in length, which drains a\r\nswamp lying south.\r\n\r\nAnother stream from the south, two miles in length, flows into Itasca,\r\nand has its source in a lake one-fourth of a mile long. As this lake\r\nhas not been named in any original or later township map, United\r\nStates Surveyor Chandler, Chief Clerk B. C. Baldwin and the writer, in\r\nJanuary, 1887, agreed to give it the name of Boutwell, in honor of the\r\ndevoted missionary who visited Itasca in company with Schoolcraft in\r\n1832. This lake is really the source of the Mississippi, though from\r\nits small size is not likely to receive general recognition as such.\r\nLakes Itasca, Elk and Boutwell lie in range 36, township 143, west of\r\nthe 5th principal meridian, United States survey, latitude 47.10, and\r\nlongitude 95.30 west from Greenwich United States survey. The lands\r\nbordering on and adjacent to these lakes were surveyed in October,\r\n1875, by Edwin Hall, and lie in Beltrami county, which was named after\r\nan Italian traveler who visited this section in 1823.\r\n\r\nHon. B. C. Baldwin, a member of the Minnesota constitutional\r\nconvention of 1857, told the writer that when surveying government\r\nlands in 1874, he discovered in range 37, township 143, six miles west\r\nof Itasca, a lake two and a half miles in length, without inlet or\r\noutlet, the waters apparently rising, as trees were standing in the\r\nwater near the shore and submerged at least eight feet. Small lakes of\r\nsimilar character were also discovered. Twelve miles west of Itasca\r\nthe tributaries of the Red River of the North have their source.\r\n\r\nThe latest claim made as to the discovery of the source of the\r\nMissispippi is that of Capt. Willard Glazier, who, in 1881, claimed to\r\nhave discovered Elk lake as the source of the Mississippi. The\r\nMinnesota State Historical Society promptly repudiated his\r\nassumptions, and protested against affixing to Elk lake the name\r\nGlazier, as the captain was in no sense a discoverer, either of the\r\nlake or its connections with Itasca, the adjacent lands having been\r\nsurveyed in 1875, and partially covered with claims in 1881. With far\r\nmore justice we might claim for Lake Boutwell, a more remote lake, the\r\ndistinguished honor of being the true source of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOPPER MINING ON THE ST. CROIX.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1842, a company, composed of the Harris brothers and\r\nothers, of Galena, Illinois, prospected in the Upper St. Croix valley\r\nfor copper. Their superintendent, Mr. Crosby, located a mineral permit\r\nat Pine island, one mile above St. Croix Falls, where he found rich\r\nspecimens. Citizens and operatives at St. Croix Mills gave liberally\r\nto aid the enterprise, but Mr. Crosby's health having failed he left\r\nexpecting to spend the winter in Cuba, but sickened and died at New\r\nOrleans, and the mining enterprise of the Galena company was never\r\nresumed.\r\n\r\nIn 1847, a Boston company, composed of Caleb Cushing, Robert Rantoul,\r\nDexter and Harrington, and others, of Boston, and some other\r\ncapitalists, located a mineral permit one mile square at St. Croix\r\nFalls, and another of the same dimensions on the St. Croix and Kettle\r\nRiver rapids. This proved to be a speculative scheme of Boston and\r\nWashington capitalists and politicians.\r\n\r\nIn 1848, David Dale Owen, a prominent geologist, made an exploration\r\nof the territory now included in Minnesota and Wisconsin and published\r\na report. His work being done at the order of the government, he was\r\naccompanied by a corps of scientific men, and had time and means to\r\nmake thorough investigations. He reported that the trap rock ranges of\r\nthe St. Croix, a continuation of the copper ranges of Superior, are\r\nrich in specimens of copper. These ranges crop out every few miles in\r\na southwesterly direction from Superior. The most southerly are those\r\nknown as the Dalles of the St. Croix, including as a part the\r\nFranconia ledge three miles below. The Kanabec river range crops out\r\nnear Chengwatana. The Kettle river range crosses the St. Croix further\r\nnorth.\r\n\r\nIn 1865 the Minnesota legislature placed the sum of $1,000 in the\r\nhands of N. C. D. Taylor for the purpose of examining and reporting\r\nthe different mineral prospects on the St. Croix and its tributaries.\r\nHe reported the Kettle river veins as being very promising. Mr. Taylor\r\nsunk a shaft in a locality in Taylor's Falls to a depth of forty feet\r\nand found excellent indications of copper, and some good specimens. He\r\nreports most of the rock in the St. Croix valley above Taylor's Falls\r\nto be of the different kinds of trap rock, with belts of conglomerate\r\nrunning through them in a direction from northeast to southwest, the\r\nconglomerate being most abundant on the Kettle river. There are\r\nlimited patches of sandstone which in places contain marine shells,\r\nbut no rock in place. Prof. Hall says of the Taylor's Falls vein that\r\nit is a very distinct vein and shows quite equal to the early showing\r\nof many of the best paying mines of Superior. He regards the Kettle\r\nriver vein as one of the most promising yet found in the country.\r\n\r\nOther veins have been discovered in the vicinity of the St. Croix\r\nDalles. Considerable money has been spent in prospecting and\r\ndevelopment, but more capital is needed than miners have yet been able\r\nto obtain.\r\n\r\nTaylor's Falls Copper Mining Company was organized Dec. 15, 1874, W.\r\nH. C. Folsom, president; Geo. W. Seymour, secretary; Levi W. Folsom,\r\ntreasurer; David A. Caneday, mining agent. They sunk a shaft one\r\nhundred and thirty feet deep and found good indications. This mine was\r\nworked in 1875-76, at an expenditure of over $5,000. Excellent\r\nspecimens were found but not in paying quantities. The rock increased\r\nin richness as the shaft sunk in depth. The work was suspended for\r\nwant, of material aid. There is but little doubt that as the valley\r\nbecomes known and populated, that as wealth increases, the mineral\r\nresources of the country are better known, mining will become a\r\nprominent and profitable industry.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMINISCENCES OF REV. JULIUS S. WEBBER.[K]\r\n\r\nWe reached Stillwater, June 3, 1850, and moved into the Elfelt house\r\non North Hill. The village contained at that time about thirty\r\ndwellings, two hotels, three stores, and a number of saloons. Three\r\nreligious denominations held services each Sabbath, the missionaries\r\nin charge alternating through the successive Sabbaths, and supporting\r\nin addition a union prayer meeting and Sabbath-school, of which Capt.\r\nWm. Holcomb was the first superintendent. The meetings were held in a\r\nschool house on Third street.\r\n\r\nMy appointments outside of Stillwater were at Willow River, Kinnikinic\r\nand Prescott, Wisconsin, and at Cottage Grove and Point Douglas in\r\nMinnesota. In 1852 Rev. S. T. Catlin was appointed to that part of my\r\nfield lying east of the St. Croix river, and I formed appointments at\r\nArcola, Marine, Taylor's and St. Croix Falls. We organized a Baptist\r\nsociety at Stillwater, Oct. 26, 1850, consisting of eight members;\r\nRev. J. P. Parsons and wife, Dean A. H. Cavender and wife of St. Paul,\r\nJ. S. Webber and wife, constituting a council of recognition. Rev. J.\r\nP. Parsons preached the sermon of recognition, and J. S. Webber\r\nextended the right hand of fellowship. The first baptism by immersion\r\nin the county was administered in a large spring just below Nelson's\r\nstore, Jan. 30, 1853, the waters of the spring being free from ice.\r\nThe candidate was Margaret Towner, of Pembina. In 1853 I made a tour\r\nof the Minnesota valley to Mankato. On the first day, September 23d, I\r\ntraveled from Fort Snelling to Shakopee and saw not a human habitation\r\nnor a human being on the trail. At Shakopee I found a home with Judge\r\nDowling. On the next day I traveled to Le Sueur. On Sabbath morning I\r\npreached at Traverse des Sioux, and in the afternoon I went to\r\nMankato, and stopped at the house of Mr. Hannah, where I preached in\r\nthe evening, to a congregation that had come together hastily from the\r\nneighborhood, the first sermon preached in Mankato. On the\r\ntwenty-sixth I preached the first sermon at Le Seuer, and the first\r\nsermon at Shakopee on my return.\r\n\r\nIn 1854 I opened on the South Hill, known later as Nelson's addition\r\nto Stillwater, a school known as Washington Seminary, which received\r\nliberal patronage from the citizens of Stillwater and surrounding\r\ncountry. In May, 1855, I sold the school to Mr. Kent, and it passed\r\ninto the hands of an Episcopal clergyman. I returned to New York where\r\nI have since lived, pursuing my calling, which has suffered thus far\r\nno interruption from sickness or infirmities.\r\n\r\nThe remembrance of my association with the people of the St. Croix\r\nvalley is pleasant. Amongst the most pleasant of my recollections are\r\nthose of the lumbermen of St. Croix, who often made up a large portion\r\nof my congregation. They were kind and courteous, attentive hearers\r\nand valued as friends and associates.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN AMUSING INCIDENT.\r\n\r\nAn amusing incident occurred in Carver county, in Judge E. O. Hamlin's\r\ndistrict (an account of which was published in \"The Drawer\" of\r\nHarper's _Monthly_, some years after it occurred). Judge Hamlin,\r\ngoing to Chaska to hold his first term of court in Carver county,\r\nfound the sheriff absent, and his deputy, a foreigner who could speak\r\nEnglish very imperfectly, ignorant alike of his duties and of the\r\nlanguage in which they were to be performed, confessed his entire\r\nignorance of \"how to open court,\" but said he could read writing.\r\nTherefore Judge Hamlin wrote out the form for opening court, and\r\ninstructed him when the order was given for \"the sheriff to open\r\ncourt,\" to stand up and read distinctly the form prepared for him.\r\nThis was in the usual terms, beginning \"Hear ye, hear ye, all manner\r\nof persons having any business,\" etc., etc., and ending with \"come\r\nforward and give your attendance, and you shall be heard.\" At the hour\r\nfixed the court room was reasonably well filled. Parties, witnesses\r\nand jurors, together with the district attorney (who at that time went\r\nwith the judge over the whole district) were in attendance. The judge\r\nwas on the bench, and the deputy sheriff, fully conscious of the\r\ndignity of his office, awaited the order of the judge. Upon being told\r\nto \"make proclamation for the opening of court,\" this officer arose,\r\nand holding the written form before his eyes, roared out in stentorian\r\ntones: \"_Here we are! Here we are!_\" and running through the remainder\r\nof the form closed with \"come forward and give your attendance, and\r\nyou _will be sure to be here_!\" The air of importance with which it\r\nwas said, together with his self complacency in the discharge of his\r\nnew duties, was scarcely less amusing than the mistake he had made.\r\nIts effect may be better imagined than described.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OLD SETTLERS ASSOCIATION.\r\n\r\nBy an act of the legislature approved May 33, 1857, the \"Old Settlers\r\nAssociation\" was incorporated with the following charter members: H.\r\nH. Sibley, Socrates Nelson, Franklin Steele, A. L. Larpenteur, Wm.\r\nHolcombe, Wm. H. Randall, Wm. Hartshorn, Cornelius Lyman, Lorenzo A.\r\nBabcock, J. D. Ludden, David Olmsted, H. M. Rice, Alex. Ramsey, Wm. R.\r\nMarshall, Jos. R. Brown, Chas. W. Borup, Henry Jackson, Martin McLeod,\r\nNorman W. Kittson, Vetal Guerin, J. W. Selby, Aaron Goodrich, and\r\nPhilander Prescott. These members, with those whom they might\r\nassociate with them, were duly empowered to buy, sell, hold property,\r\nto sue or be sued, to receive donations, to keep a common seal, and to\r\nenjoy all the franchises incident to a corporate body.\r\n\r\nIt was provided that no person should be eligible to a membership who\r\nhad not been a resident of the Territory prior to Jan. 1, 1850. The\r\nseal of the association was devised by Aaron Goodrich. On the two\r\nsides of the seal were represented the past and the future. In the\r\nbackground of the side representing the past is delineated a plain; in\r\nthe distance are seen the last rays of the declining sun; nearer are\r\nseen Indian hunters, their lodges, women and children, and a herd of\r\nbuffalo.\r\n\r\nProminent in the foreground of the side representing the future stands\r\nan aged man with silvered hair; he leans upon his staff; he is in the\r\nmidst of a cemetery; the spire of a church is seen in the distance; as\r\nhe turns from a survey of the various monuments which mark the resting\r\nplace of departed old settlers, his eye rests upon a new made grave.\r\nIt is that of his last associate; _he is the last survivor_; his\r\ncompanions have fallen asleep. A group of children in the foreground\r\nrepresents the rising generation of Minnesota which shall reap the\r\nfruits of the pioneer's toil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEAL OF THE ASSOCIATION.]\r\n\r\n\r\nORGANIZATION.\r\n\r\nThe first meeting of the Old Settlers Association was held, in\r\npursuance of public notice, at the hall of the Historical Society of\r\nMinnesota, in the capitol, in St. Paul, on Saturday, Feb. 27, 1858.\r\n\r\nOn motion of Judge Goodrich, his excellency Henry H. Sibley was\r\nunanimously elected president. Hon. Aaron Goodrich and Hon. L. A.\r\nBabcock were unanimously elected vice presidents, A. L. Larpenteur,\r\nEsq., secretary, and J. W. Bass, Esq. treasurer. After which Gov.\r\nSibley addressed the meeting in a manner able, pertinent and feeling.\r\nSeveral other members spoke.\r\n\r\nOn motion a committee of three was appointed by the chair to report\r\nby-laws for the government of the association. Also a committee of\r\nthree to report such measures as shall be deemed best calculated to\r\neffectuate the objects of the charter.\r\n\r\nThe president appointed H. L. Moss, L. A. Babcock and T. R. Potts\r\ncommittee on by-laws, and Aaron Goodrich, B. W. Lott and Chas. S. Cave\r\ncommittee on charter.\r\n\r\nJudge Goodrich said this occasion was one of deep and abiding interest\r\nto the pioneers of Minnesota; that there were epochs in our history\r\nthat should be commemorated. He desired that the first day of June be\r\nfixed upon as the day for the future meetings of the association; he\r\nnamed this day for the reason that on the first day of June, 1849, the\r\nlocal organization of this Territory took place.\r\n\r\nThe following resolution was adopted:\r\n\r\n_Resolved, That the annual meeting of this association be held_ on the\r\nfirst day of June, providing that when said month shall commence on\r\nthe Sabbath, said meeting shall be held on the following Monday.\r\n\r\nOn motion of Judge Goodrich the following preamble and resolution were\r\nadopted:\r\n\r\nWHEREAS, The object of this association and the individuals composing\r\nthe same are closely _allied_ to and identified with that of the\r\nHistorical Society of Minnesota, therefore\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That up to the period in which this association shall\r\npossess a hall in which to meet, its place of meeting shall be the\r\nhall of said Historical Society.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of history we record the names of the members originally\r\nand subsequently enrolled.\r\n\r\n    Ames, Michael E.*\r\n    Ayer, Frederick.*\r\n    Abbott, G.

The original\r\ncharter of the society stated its objects to be: \"The collection and\r\npreservation of a library, mineralogical and geological specimens,\r\nIndian curiosities, and other matters and things connected with, and\r\ncalculated to illustrate and perpetuate the history and settlement of\r\nsaid Territory.\" The amended charter of 1856 enacted: \"The objects of\r\nsaid society, with the enlarged powers and duties herein provided,\r\nshall be in addition to the collection and preservation of\r\npublications, manuscripts, antiquities, curiosities, and other things\r\npertaining to the social, political and natural history of Minnesota,\r\nto cultivate among the citizens thereof a knowledge of the useful and\r\nliberal arts, science and literature.\"\r\n\r\nThe work of this society may therefore be formulated thus:\r\n\r\nI. (1) The collection, (2) the preservation, (3) the publication of\r\nmaterials for the history of Minnesota and its people.\r\n\r\nII. The collection and management of a library containing useful works\r\nof reference on the most valuable departments of knowledge.\r\n\r\nIII. The diffusion among citizens of the State of useful knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\nITS PROGRESS.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of the Territory, owing to its want of means, the\r\nsparse population and its poverty, and the infancy of the commonwealth\r\ngenerally, the society accomplished but little beyond collecting some\r\ninformation regarding the early history of this region, and printing\r\nthe same in several pamphlet volumes. In 1864 it had only eight\r\nhundred and forty volumes in its library. It was then reorganized, and\r\nwith the aid of a small annual appropriation from the State, since\r\nenlarged, has been able to make very gratifying progress.\r\n\r\n\r\nITS PRESENT CONDITION.\r\n\r\nIt has now comfortable apartments in the state capitol, a building\r\nbelieved to be fireproof; a sufficient income to pay its current\r\nexpenses, granted partly by the State and partly contributed by its\r\nmembers; one of the largest and most valuable libraries in the State,\r\ncontaining 22,000 volumes of choice works, together with a cabinet or\r\nmuseum of historical and archælogical curiosities, and a number of\r\nhistorical pictures, engravings, manuscripts, etc. An endowment fund\r\nof several thousand dollars, accumulated by gifts and membership fees;\r\ntwo lots, eligibly situated, on which at no distant day, will be\r\nerected a fireproof building.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPOSED BUILDING FOR THE SOCIETY.\r\n\r\nReference was made before to the building lots of the society. These\r\nwere purchased by a subscription of the members in 1855, for the sum\r\nof $1,500, in hopes that the society would be enabled to erect thereon\r\na fireproof building for its use, but up to this time it has not been\r\nable to do so. The lots are now valued at $20,000 or more. Several\r\nmonths ago an effort was made by the president of the society to raise\r\nenough by subscription to insure the commencement of a building to\r\ncost, completed, $50,000; of this amount $14,500 was subscribed, and\r\nit is believed that there are liberal and public spirited citizens of\r\nour State who will contribute the balance when called on, or provide,\r\nby will, for bequests in its aid. Such an edifice would be a\r\nperpetual monument to their generosity and public spirit, and would be\r\nan inestimable boon to succeeding generations, who will frequent our\r\nlibrary in pursuit of knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENTS OF THE OLD SETTLERS ASSOCIATION.\r\n\r\n    1858.

Winfield Scott, when a young man, was stationed at Fort Snelling,\r\nat that day perhaps the remotest outpost of the United States. When\r\nthe Black Hawk War was inaugurated some militia from Illinois\r\nproffered their services to aid in conquering the savages. With a view\r\nto mustering them into the service of the United States two\r\nlieutenants were sent by Scott to the then village of Dixon. One of\r\nthese was a very fascinating, good-looking, easy-mannered, affable,\r\nand fluent young gentleman. The other equally pleasant, but an\r\nexceedingly modest young man. On the morning when the mustering in was\r\nto take place a tall, gawky, slab-sided, homely young man, dressed in\r\na suit of home-made blue jeans, presented himself to the two\r\nlieutenants as the captain of the recruits, and was duly sworn in.\r\nThis was he who afterward became the president of the United\r\nStates--the lamented Lincoln. One of the lieutenants, the modest\r\nyouth, was he who fired the first gun from Sumter, Maj. Anderson. The\r\nother, and he who administered the oath, was in after years president\r\nof the southern confederacy, Jefferson Davis.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN EARLY RUNAWAY MATCH.\r\n\r\nWe have gleaned from the newspapers the particulars of a love romance\r\nin which Jefferson Davis was the central figure.\r\n\r\nIt was down at old Fort Crawford, whose ruins are still to be seen\r\njust south of Prairie du Chien. It was away back in 1834, when\r\nex-President Zachariah Taylor, then a colonel in the regular army, was\r\ncommandant of the post. Jeff. Davis, who was then a young lieutenant,\r\nwas assigned to duty under Col. Taylor, and fell in love with his\r\ncommander's beautiful daughter. The love making between the young\r\npeople was the most natural thing in the world under the\r\ncircumstances, but for some reason Col. Taylor had taken the most\r\nintense dislike to the young lieutenant and frowned upon his suit. In\r\norder to prevent his daughter from marrying Davis the grim old warrior\r\nsent her to a convent at Baton Rouge.\r\n\r\nSome months afterward the young lieutenant appeared before Col. Taylor\r\nwith a document which required his signature. It was an order from\r\nGen. Wayne granting a furlough to Davis. Old Zach. understood human\r\nnature well enough to know that when young Davis got his leave of\r\nabsence he would take a bee line for Baton Rouge, so he immediately\r\ndispatched his swiftest messenger to bring his daughter home by the\r\nmost circuitous route, and thus thwart the young officer, who he knew\r\nwould be hurrying to meet her. When Davis returned to Fort Crawford\r\nthe coldness between himself and his old commander grew more frigid,\r\nwhile the young woman pined away in the seclusion of a log hut, where\r\nher father had established his headquarters, until at last she was\r\nreleased from her imprisonment by her lover, who took her from her\r\nfather's roof by stealth and in the night, and taking her across the\r\nriver to a spot where a priest was in waiting, they were made man and\r\nwife.\r\n\r\nGeorge Green, an old river man, now eighty years old, who still lives\r\nat Prairie du Chien, is the person who rowed them over the river that\r\nnight. He says that Davis took the young woman from an upper window in\r\nthe log cabin and by the assistance of the chaplain was able to get\r\nher beyond the picket lines unobserved. Green was at the river bank in\r\nwaiting with a canoe and took them to the spot where the marriage\r\nceremony was performed. He says the young lady cried a good deal\r\nduring the voyage across the river, but she leaned her head on the\r\nyoung lieutenant's bosom in a way that assured him that she was not\r\naltogether unhappy. Soon after the marriage a steamboat from St. Paul\r\ncame down the river and by a preconcerted arrangement halted, took the\r\nbridal couple on board and passed on down the Mississippi to Jeff.\r\nDavis' home in the South.\r\n\r\nGen. Taylor never did forgive Davis for marrying his daughter. He\r\nnever spoke to him from that time until the evening after the close of\r\nthe battle of Buena Vista. Jeff. Davis had undoubtedly won the battle\r\nwith his Mississippi Rifles, and as he lay wounded in his tent that\r\nnight Gen. Taylor walked in, extended his hand in friendly greeting\r\nand thanked him for his gallant services. But there was no further\r\nattempt at reconciliation after that. Mrs. Davis did not live long,\r\nand the lady who now presides over Beauvoir is Mr. Davis' second wife.\r\nShe was a Miss Howell, of Georgia.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRED SCOTT AT FORT SNELLING.\r\n\r\nThe following incident connected with the famous Dred Scott case,\r\ntaken from a St. Paul paper of 1887, may prove of interest to the\r\npresent generation of readers, few of whom are aware that the\r\nprincipal personage in the case was a resident of Fort Snelling, or\r\nmore exactly speaking, the chattel of an American officer at that\r\nplace:\r\n\r\nIn the year 1839 the Fifth United States Infantry was stationed on the\r\nUpper Mississippi and Wisconsin rivers, and, although Fort Crawford\r\n(Prarie du Chien) was their headquarters, Fort Snelling was the most\r\nimportant, it being the only military post north of Prairie du Chien,\r\nbetween Lake Superior and the Pacific ocean, and far from the\r\nfrontier, as the nearest settlement was several hundred miles away.\r\n\r\nDuring the season of open water the post was reached by boats, and in\r\nthe winter by pony or dog trains, but in the spring before the river\r\nwas free of floating ice and in the fall before it was frozen, the\r\ninhabitants were almost cut off from civilization, as the place was\r\nconsidered inaccessible, by all but the hardy voyageur and the\r\npostman, who brought the mail on his back twice a month from Prairie\r\ndu Chien. Fort Snelling was the only post office in what is now\r\nMinnesota, Dakota and Montana.\r\n\r\nIt was seldom that a stranger made his appearance after the close of\r\nnavigation, for the timid did not venture so far from the comforts of\r\nlife. During the winter the weather was severe, the houses were not so\r\ncomfortable as now, storm windows and furnaces were unthought of, and\r\nstoves were considered luxuries.\r\n\r\nIt happened that on a cold, dreary day in the early winter the\r\nquartermaster was distributing stoves, but did not have more than\r\nenough to supply the officers and the married men of the command, and\r\nnot all of the latter. The surgeon, Dr. Emerson, a giant in body,\r\napplied for one for his slave, Dred Scott, but was told by Lieut.\r\nMcPhail, the quartermaster, who was a man under size, that the darkey\r\nwould have to wait until the others were supplied, and it was doubtful\r\nif there were enough for all. The doctor became very much excited and\r\ninsinuated that McPhail was lying, whereupon the latter hit the doctor\r\nbetween the eyes, breaking his spectacles and bruising his nose.\r\nEmerson, very much infuriated, rushed to his quarters, loaded a pair\r\nof huge flintlock pistols, returned to McPhail, who was unarmed, and\r\nwithout ceremony presented them to the head of the little\r\nquartermaster. He, not liking their looks, sought safety in flight,\r\nand with a speed that showed a good condition of body ran across the\r\nparade ground, followed by the doctor. As they neared McPhail's\r\ncompany quarters a friend of his, Lieut. Whitall, and a sergeant,\r\nseized firearms and prepared to give their assistance if it was\r\nneeded. The commanding officer, Maj. Plympton, armed with a cane, ran\r\nafter the doctor, and upon overtaking him put him under arrest. By\r\nthis time the occupants of all the quarters had gathered upon the\r\nscene, too excited to feel the cold or think of stoves, and two\r\nparties were quickly formed. The smaller party consisted of the young\r\nmen, who, anxious for a fight, insisted that by running McPhail had\r\nbrought disgrace upon himself which could be wiped out only by blood.\r\nThe other and influential side was composed of men with families, who\r\nknew that in case of illness no other physician could be had except\r\nfrom Prairie du Chien, and the roads were such that it might be\r\nimpossible to get one at all; therefore they urged peace, and after\r\nseveral days of excitement they were able to unfurl the flag of\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\nThe terms of settlement between the belligerents were not made known,\r\nand those who had hoped for a fight felt that the secrecy added\r\nlargely to their already heavy disappointment; but the men of peace\r\nwore an expression of relief when they realized that if ill, their\r\nvictory would enable them to obtain the immediate services of the\r\ndoctor, and that there would not be a repetition of the duel which had\r\nbeen fought there many years before, the first and last duel ever\r\nfought in Minnesota. Although peace was declared, bitter feelings\r\nwhich had risen during the strife still lingered in the heads of all\r\nbut Dred Scott, the innocent cause of the trouble, who for the first\r\ntime in his life became at all conspicuous. Shortly after, however,\r\nhis name was as well known, and oftener heard in social, military and\r\npolitical circles than any other, not only in his own country, but\r\nabroad. He left Fort Snelling with Dr. Emerson, and was afterward in\r\nMissouri, where he was one day whipped, as he had often been before.\r\nBut this proved to be the last time the poor fellow intended\r\nsubmitting as a slave, for immediately after a suit was commenced for\r\nassault and battery, claiming that as he had been in a free territory\r\nhe was a free man. His master dying, his widow and daughter defended\r\nthe suit, which was decided in their favor two days after the\r\ninauguration of President Buchanan, and Dred Scott was remanded to\r\nslavery. This was considered a great victory for the South, but in\r\nreality was not, for the civilized world became aroused in behalf of\r\nfreedom, and public opinion, the higher law, was invoked. Civil war\r\nsoon followed; slavery was abolished, and Dred Scott made free. It was\r\nhalf a century ago that this simple-minded negro lived in slavery in\r\nHennepin, the historic county of Minnesota.\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD BETZ AND THE ST. PAUL TRIBE OF INDIANS.\r\n\r\nNo history of the early days would be complete without mention of the\r\ncelebrated and picturesquely homely squaw known as Old Betz and the\r\ntribe to which she belonged. The camp of the latter may still be seen\r\nat South St. Paul to the number of three or four tepees. The Indians\r\nare the descendants of the warriors of Little Crow. They live in\r\ncanvas tepees of primitive style, but with the exception of moccasins\r\nand a few Indian trinkets they have conformed somewhat to the costumes\r\nof the civilized people around them.\r\n\r\nThe Indians living in this vicinity, says A. L. Larpenteur in the\r\n_Pioneer Press_, represent a remnant of the Minnesota Sioux who were\r\nnot taken to the reservation after the massacre of 1861. There may be\r\nnearly a score of families in all, including the inhabitants of the\r\nlittle Indian village at South St. Paul, the aboriginal residents at\r\nMendota, and some red men living near Newport. These are mostly\r\ndescendants of the members of Little Crow's band. Three or four\r\nfamilies have descended from the famous old squaw known as \"Old Betz,\"\r\nwho died at an advanced age only two years ago. At least two of old\r\nBetz's daughters are living. They are very large, fleshy squaws, and\r\nare frequently seen on the streets of St. Paul. When you catch sight\r\nof a big squaw with a heavy pack slung over her shoulders, seated in\r\nsome doorway down street panting for breath, you may make up your mind\r\nthat it is one of Old Betz's daughters--either Doo-to-win (Scarlet\r\nFemale) or Pa-zen-ta-win (Medicine Woman); for such are their names.\r\n\r\nThey obtain a livelihood suitable to their lingering aboriginal tastes\r\nand their condition of life, by selling moccasins, ginseng and wild\r\nflowers in their season, and the skins of animals which they hunt or\r\ntrap. These skins are chiefly muskrat skins. They bring several\r\nhundred to market in the course of the season. Then the squaws do the\r\nbegging, and the great white packs which these dusky females carry\r\nupon their backs as they trudge along the streets of the city are\r\nfilled with specked fruit, tainted chickens and meat, dried up\r\ncranberries and other unsalable stuff that the commission men of the\r\ncity have kindly bestowed upon them. An Indian is not so particular\r\nabout what he eats as a white person. When meat is tainted he boils it\r\nuntil he gets all the taint out. What remains serves as savory sauce\r\nfor the meat. The Indians are intelligent. They don't have much to say\r\nto strangers, but among themselves they are quite sociable, and sit\r\ntogether by the hour smoking pipes and recounting traditions and\r\nincidents. They are very fond of story telling. They also discuss\r\ntopics of interest with a freedom and intelligence worthy of a modern\r\nwhite man's debating society. \"I have sat with them in their lodges by\r\nthe hour,\" says Mr. Larpenteur, \"and have been vastly entertained by\r\ntheir anecdotes and discussions.\" So it appears that the Indians\r\nhereabout are not so glum and reticent as red men in general are\r\ncredited with being.\r\n\r\nThere are a great many people in St. Paul who remember Old Betz, and\r\nthe stories that were told in relation to her, quite well. She was\r\nsaid to be one hundred and twenty years old when she died, and, as\r\nthere was no evidence to the contrary, and she certainly bore the mark\r\nof great age, this estimate of her years was generally accepted. Mr.\r\nLarpenteur has reason for thinking that her age has been very much\r\nexaggerated. Old Betz told him one day, a short time before her death,\r\nin a confidential way, that when soldiers first came to Fort Snelling\r\nshe was still in her teens. That was in 1819, and, therefore, Old Betz\r\ncould not have been over eighty-eight when she died.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[F] NOTE.--The Wah-tap--or Wa-tab--empties from the west into the\r\nMississippi just above Sauk Rapids--H. M. R.\r\n\r\n[G] The rejection of Thomas P. Burnett as a member of the council, by\r\nGov. Dodge, created great excitement at the time, and the governor was\r\nseverely criticised for his action. In making the apportionment the\r\ngovernor had made Crawford county a district, but had left it without\r\na representative in the council, although two had been assigned to the\r\nhouse, the governor claiming that this was equivalent to one in the\r\nsenate and one in the house. His action, to say the least, was curious\r\nand unprecedented.\r\n\r\n[H] Jean Brunet was of French extraction. He made the first\r\nmanufacturing improvements at Chippewa Falls.\r\n\r\n[I] Alexander McGregor, a Scotchman, built a large hotel in Prairie du\r\nChien, and located a claim on the western side of the Mississippi\r\nrivers opposite which has become the site of the city of McGregor. In\r\nthe third session of the territorial legislature he was elected to\r\nrepresent the Dubuque district, and charges were preferred against him\r\nof accepting a bribe. Pending the investigation of the charges he\r\nresigned, removed to the east side of the river and was elected to\r\nrepresent the Crawford district. The ensuing session, the house, by\r\nresolution, declared him unworthy of confidence.\r\n\r\n[J] The loan amendment was approved by Gov. Medary, through his\r\nprivate secretary, March 9, 1858. The amendment was adopted by the\r\npeople April 15, 1858, by a vote of 25,023 to 6,733. The amount of\r\nbonds issued was $2,275,000. The expunging resolution was adopted Nov.\r\n6, 1860, by a popular vote of 19,308 to 710.\r\n\r\n[K] Rev Mr. Webber was born in the state of New York in 1821; was\r\neducated for the ministry ordained and sent to Minnesota as a\r\nmissionary by the Calvinistic Baptist church. He came to Stillwater in\r\n1850. He is now a resident of Fleming, Cayuga county, New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDENDA.\r\n\r\n\r\nA history of the Northwest that would omit any mention of the war of\r\nthe Rebellion would be an unfinished work. It was the original\r\nintention of the author of this work to add a military history in\r\nwhich should be placed upon record not only some statistics as to the\r\nnumber of troops contributed to the United States service from the\r\nparts of Minnesota and Wisconsin lying along the Mississippi river,\r\nbut some account of incidents connected with the war, which the\r\ncitizens of the valley would take pride in perusing. The plan was\r\nabandoned reluctantly on account of the want of space for such a\r\nrecord. We are able to furnish a synopsis of the military history of\r\nMinnesota taken from a recent address made by ex-Gov. Ramsey before\r\nthe Loyal Legion at St. Paul. It is doubly interesting, coming as it\r\ndoes from the governor of the State during the earlier portion of the\r\nwar:\r\n\r\nEx-Gov. Alexander Ramsey was called upon to respond to the toast,\r\n\"Minnesota and the War; For God, Our Country and the Right.\" He said:\r\n\r\n\"Amid the many evidences of harmony and prosperity in all sections of\r\nthe great republic it is difficult to realize that the citizens of\r\nMinnesota, within the memory of many still alive, were called upon to\r\npreserve the integrity of the United States of America by the force of\r\narms.\r\n\r\n\"There has ever been a community of interest between our own State, in\r\nwhose midst are found the sources of the Mississippi, and the several\r\nstates on its borders toward the Gulf of Mexico; the wheat fields of\r\nMinnesota, the cotton and sugar plantations of Mississippi and\r\nLouisiana must be inseparable, yet it can not be disguised that a\r\nshort-sighted statesmanship made a vigorous attempt to separate those\r\nwhom an all-wise Providence had joined together.\r\n\r\n\"In the month of April, 1861, upon official business as governor of\r\nMinnesota, I was called to the city of Washington. The knots of\r\nearnest men and anxious faces in the corridors and reading rooms of\r\nthe hotels indicated a widespread belief that there was an impending\r\nperil, a serious conspiracy upon the part of some in the cotton\r\nproducing and slave holding states to secede from the Union, although\r\nthe general government had never infringed upon their rights under the\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\n\"On Saturday night, April 13th, the population of Washington was\r\ndeeply moved by the intelligence that Fort Sumter in the harbor of\r\nCharleston had been attacked by insurgents, and that the garrison had\r\nsurrendered.\r\n\r\n\"Early Sunday morning, accompanied by two citizens of Minnesota, I\r\nvisited the war department, and found the secretary with his hat on\r\nand papers in his hand about to leave his office. I said 'My business\r\nis simply as governor of Minnesota to tender a thousand men to defend\r\nthe government.' 'Sit down immediately,' he replied, 'and write the\r\ntender you have made, as I am now on my way to the president's\r\nmansion.'\r\n\r\n\"This was quickly done, and thus Minnesota became the first to cheer\r\nthe president by offers of assistance in the crisis which had arrived.\r\n\r\n\"My action and the acceptance of this offer were dispatched to St.\r\nPaul, and in a few days companies in the different towns in Minnesota\r\nwere being organized, and on the twenty-seventh of the month Adjt.\r\nGen. John B. Sanborn issued an order that more companies had been\r\norganized than were necessary to complete the First regiment of\r\nMinnesota, and on the third of May, having returned to St. Paul during\r\nApril, I sent a telegram to the president offering a second regiment.\r\n\r\n\"On the twenty-first of June the First regiment, under Col. Gorman,\r\nleft Fort Snelling, and in one month, on Sunday, the twenty-first of\r\nJuly, distinguished itself as the advance of Heintzleman's division in\r\nthe battle of Bull Run, Virginia. The Second regiment, in command of\r\nCol. H. P. Van Cleve, a graduate of West Point, left Fort Snelling in\r\nOctober, and on the nineteenth of January was in close conflict with\r\nthe enemy near Mill Springs, Kentucky, Gen. Zollicoffer and other\r\ninsurgent officers having fallen under their fire. A third regiment,\r\nunder Col. H. C. Lester, left the State in November, 1861, and a\r\nfourth regiment, under Col. John B. Sanborn, was soon organized, and\r\nnot long after a fifth, under Col. Borgersrode, was formed. In the\r\nspring of 1862, within a few weeks of each other, the last two left\r\nfor the seat of war, and were assigned to the Army of the Mississippi,\r\nand before the close of May were, with their comrades of the Second,\r\nin the action at Corinth.\r\n\r\n\"But while Minnesota was thus rapidly sending forth her able bodied\r\nmen, she was called upon to endure a trial greater than any of her\r\nsister states. On the nineteenth of August there rushed into the\r\ngovernor's office at the capitol a dusty and exhausted messenger who\r\nhad been fifteen hours in the saddle with dispatches from Galbraith,\r\nthe Sioux agent, containing the startling intelligence that the Sioux\r\nhad risen and were murdering the settlers and plundering and burning\r\ntheir houses. An hour or two later another messenger arrived from\r\nForest City with information that the Sioux had also killed many\r\nwhites at Acton. It was evident that there was a general uprising, and\r\nthat no time was to be lost.\r\n\r\n\"I immediately proceeded to Fort Snelling and consulted as to the best\r\nmeasures to protect our people. Here were only raw recruits, without\r\narms or clothing, but at length four companies of the Sixth regiment\r\nwere organized, and that night sent up the Minnesota river to\r\nShakopee, and ex-Gov. H. H. Sibley, who had had a long acquaintance\r\nwith the Sioux, was placed in command.\r\n\r\n\"From that point they were directed to proceed by land. Telegrams were\r\nsent to President Lincoln and the governors of Wisconsin, Iowa,\r\nIllinois, and Michigan relative to the horrible outbreak and asking\r\nfor aid.\r\n\r\n\"When the troops reached St. Peter they were delayed in moulding balls\r\nto fit their arms and in preparing canister shot. By September\r\nportions of the Third regiment, which had returned to the State, and\r\nthe Sixth and Seventh regiments, which had been organized, were in the\r\nfield, and on the twenty-third of the month had a battle with the\r\nIndians at Wood lake, Lieut. Col. Marshall, of the Seventh regiment,\r\nyour late commander of this legion, leading five companies of his own\r\nand two of the Sixth in a successful charge, clearing a ravine of\r\nhostile savages.\r\n\r\n\"Never before in the history of the republic had so many settlers\r\nfallen from Indian barbarity. In ten days in August about eight\r\nhundred white men, women and children were killed, and at least 15,000\r\npersons fled from the scalping knife to St. Paul and other places of\r\nsecurity.\r\n\r\n\"During the summer of 1862 the Eighth, Ninth and Tenth Minnesota\r\nregiments of Volunteers were organized. In January, 1863, having been\r\nelected to represent the State in the United States senate, Lieut.\r\nGov. Swift on and after the tenth of July acted as governor for the\r\nunexpired term, who was succeeded by Gov. Stephen H. Miller, both of\r\nwhom, in every way possible, sustained the general government.\r\n\r\n\"Minnesota during the war had surely not more than 40,000 citizens\r\nable to bear arms. She furnished eleven regiments of infantry, one of\r\nheavy artillery, three batteries of light artillery, four cavalry\r\norganizations and two companies of sharpshooters, and official returns\r\nshow that she contributed 25,000 soldiers in all.\"\r\n\r\nMention of George H. Hazzard, of St. Paul, unintentionally omitted\r\nfrom the body of the work, is appended below.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GEORGE H. HAZZARD.]\r\n\r\nGeorge H.
