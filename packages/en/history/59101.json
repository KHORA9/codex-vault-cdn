The Type uſed is _Caſlon_, developed in the\r\nearly Part of the eighteenth Century by _William Caſlon_, the greateﬅ of\r\nthe Engliſh Letter Founders. _Caſlon_ in 1734 iſſued his firﬅ Broadſide\r\nSpecimen Sheet of Type Faces cut at his Foundry during the preceding\r\nDecade and a Half.\r\n\r\nAlthough _Caſlon_ is famous for the beautiful Type that bears his Name,\r\nhe deſerves equal Credit for deſigning ſome of the moﬅ handſome Type\r\nOrnaments or “Flowers” ever developed, before or after his Time. Such\r\nType Flowers had many Uſes—to embelliſh Initial Letters at the Beginning\r\nof a Chapter in a Book; as decorative Devices in a ſingle Row over a\r\nType Heading ﬅarting a new Page in a Book; or over Headings each Time a\r\nnew Subject was introduced in a Text. Flowers were caﬅ to all the\r\nregular Bodies of the Letter from the ſmall (_Nonpareil_) to the large\r\n(_Great Primer_) Size. The Type Flowers uſed at the Head of this Page,\r\nin the built-up Initial opening the firﬅ Paragraph, and elſewhere in\r\nthis Publication are reproduced from original eighteenth-century Flowers\r\nexcavated at the Site of the Printing Office on _Duke of Glouceﬅer_\r\nStreet in _Williamſburg_.\r\n\r\nThe longs “s” ſo evident in theſe Paragraphs originated in the _German_\r\nHand Script. Early _German_ Type Founders attempted to reproduce\r\nHandwriting as cloſely as poſſible. In the Attempt the long “s” was\r\nevolved and was adopted by the firﬅ _Engliſh_ Printers who learned their\r\nTrade from the _Germans_. The long “s” remained in general Uſe until\r\nabout the Year 1800. It was always uſed at the Beginning and in the\r\nMiddle of a Word, but never to terminate a Word. It can eaſily be\r\nrecognized by the Fact of having only half a Croſſbar or none at all,\r\nwhereas the Letter “f” has a full Croſſbar.\r\n\r\nLigatures, ſuch as ct, ſb, ſſ, ſi, ſſi, ſk, ſl, ſſl, ﬅ, ﬁ, ﬃ, ﬀ, ﬂ, ﬄ,\r\nwere developed where a long “s” or an “f” overlapped the following\r\nLetter. Caﬅing the two Characters together avoided Damage to the\r\noverlapping Letter. Although ſome Ligatures have fallen into Diſuſe, the\r\nﬁ, ﬃ, ﬀ, ﬂ, and ﬄ are ﬅill common today.\r\n\r\nPrinters alſo applied, through much of the Century, ſome Rules of Style\r\nwhich the modern Reader may find odd if not awkward. For Example, they\r\nbegan all Nouns with a capital Letter, thus diﬅinguiſhing them from\r\nother Parts of Speech ſuch as Adjectives, Verbs, &c. In the ſame\r\nFaſhion, they capitalized Expreſſions of particular Emphaſis, and Titles\r\nof Honor and Eminence. The Names of Perſons and Places they not only\r\nbegan with capital Letters but usually ſet in _Italic_ Type as well.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of certain _Scottiſh_ faces, small Capitals were\r\nfound in _Roman_ Fonts of Type only. They were employed to denote\r\nEmphaſis and Streſs, and were uſed where the large Capitals would not\r\nfit, i.e., were too long. Small Capitals were alſo found in the firﬅ\r\nWord of the firﬅ Paragraph after every Break in Context of a Chapter or\r\nSection of Text.\r\n\r\nStrange though ſome eighteenth-century Printing may appear to today’s\r\nReader, there is one Point that ſhould be ﬅreſſed. The Idioſyncracies of\r\na Type Page of the Period were not merely Whims of individual Printers.\r\nThey were the Faſhion of the Time. When a Printer uſed ſeveral Sizes and\r\nStyles of Type on a Page, he was practicing what he and his\r\nContemporaries conſidered to be good Typography.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             The Printer in\r\n                           Eighteenth-Century\r\n                             _Williamsburg_\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Decorative header.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            _The Printer in Eighteenth-Century_ Williamsburg\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Decorative Capital.]\r\n\r\nIf you had visited Williamsburg in the year 1743, say, and wanted to\r\npost a letter, buy a book, a newspaper, or some writing paper, or talk\r\nwith an influential townsman, you would have sought out the shop of\r\nWilliam Parks on Duke of Gloucester Street. Parks published the\r\n_Virginia Gazette_, the first newspaper in the Virginia colony, and his\r\nprinting office served also as post office, bookshop, stationery store,\r\nand general information center.\r\n\r\nIt was a place of many sounds and smells, and of much activity. There\r\nyou would find ink-smudged printer’s devils carefully sorting type under\r\nthe watchful eye of the journeyman printer, an accomplished craftsman\r\nand exacting instructor. There you would also find the bookbinder among\r\nhis calfskins, marbled papers, glues, and presses. And on the shelves,\r\nwaiting for buyers, were pamphlets and leatherbound volumes produced in\r\nthe shop or imported from England.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, if you were lucky, you might see a postrider burst in with\r\nLondon papers, rushed from a ship just arrived from England. Then the\r\nprinting shop was never livelier, for the coming of news from abroad was\r\nan exciting event. At such times, Printer Parks probably stopped what he\r\nwas doing, culled the choicest items from the London journals, and made\r\nspace for them on the front page of the next issue of the _Gazette_. In\r\na day or so, “the freshest Advices, Foreign and Domestick,” would be on\r\ntheir way to Parks’s subscribers.\r\n\r\nIn the small (1,500 people) capital of Williamsburg, this printing\r\noffice was a nerve center through which news of the vast outer world\r\nreached Virginians and, in turn, news of His Majesty’s largest American\r\ncolony was conveyed to other colonists and their homeland. By modern\r\nstandards it was a small printing shop. But in its effect on the people\r\nof the Virginia colony, it was a powerful civilizing force. As one of\r\neight or nine printers of colonial newspapers, moreover, William Parks,\r\nthrough his paper, kept the people of the other colonies informed of the\r\nmajor events that were taking place in the oldest and largest outpost of\r\nBritain in America.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _THE PRINTING OFFICE TODAY_\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, Colonial Williamsburg has re-created an\r\neighteenth-century printing office as one of its series of craft shops.\r\nHere the twentieth-century visitor will find equipment such as was used\r\ntwo hundred years ago in similar printing establishments on Duke of\r\nGloucester Street operated by Parks and later by William Hunter, Joseph\r\nRoyle, Alexander Purdie, John Dixon, William Hunter, Jr., William Rind,\r\nand their successors. Here a master printer and his apprentice, in the\r\nleather aprons and full-cut breeches of the period, set by hand type\r\nclosely resembling that which Parks used.\r\n\r\nTo print its pages of hand-set type, the present Printing Office has in\r\noperation three so-called “English Common Presses” such as were built in\r\nthe eighteenth century. One, believed to have been made about 1750, was\r\ngiven to Colonial Williamsburg by American Type Founders, Incorporated,\r\nand the Rochester Institute of Technology. Of the other two, one was\r\ndesigned by Ralph Green of Chicago after a careful study of the handful\r\nof known eighteenth-century presses in the United States, and both were\r\nbuilt by Colonial Williamsburg craftsmen.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the _Gazette_, tracts, pamphlets, and books poured from\r\nParks’s press from the time he came to Williamsburg about 1730 until he\r\ndied on a voyage to England in 1750. Surviving examples of his work\r\nreveal that he first used Dutch type, which was followed by the more\r\npleasing face so “friendly to the eye” developed by William Caslon in\r\nEngland. From matrices similar to Caslon’s originals, his successors in\r\nthe type-founding business have cast the letters used on the restored\r\nWilliamsburg press. Parks’s neat printing and binding ornaments, so\r\ncharacteristic of the classical-minded eighteenth century, have been\r\nsimilarly reproduced. Eighteenth-century printers’ tools were made from\r\nthe careful drawings in Diderot’s Encyclopedia and from other sources.\r\n\r\nTo provide the kind of paper used by eighteenth-century printers,\r\nColonial Williamsburg began research in the 1930s into the history of\r\nthe town’s only paper mill. Started by Parks about 1743 with the help of\r\nhis friend Benjamin Franklin, the mill is believed to have outlived him.\r\nExamples of its product were identified in 1936 in a German Bible and a\r\nsong book printed in Pennsylvania in 1763. Paper that simulated the\r\nParks paper was thereupon reproduced, and was used in some of the work\r\nof the Printing Office and in some Colonial Williamsburg books designed\r\nafter examples of Parks’s work. Even the specks and spots of the\r\noriginal Parks paper were imitated by a mixture of ground flaxseed\r\nincorporated into the paper to insure the appearance of authenticity.\r\n\r\nVisitors to the Printing Office today may not see counterparts of the\r\npostriders who brought mail to Parks’s printing shop and post office,\r\nbut nearly everything else is there. As in colonial days, the central\r\nfigure is still the printer, bending over his press and producing in a\r\nday’s work what one modern, mechanized press can turn out in a few\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _WILLIAMSBURG’S FIRST PRINTER_\r\n\r\nAlthough the colony of Virginia was founded in 1607, it was not until\r\nthe eighteenth century that printing was established there. This delay\r\nwas largely due to governmental policy. In seventeenth-century England\r\nand her colonies, freedom of the press was yet to be established. Even\r\nlaws passed by governing bodies could not without official permission be\r\nprinted and circulated for the benefit of citizens. Until the Licensing\r\nAct of 1662 expired in 1695, the printing trade in England was confined\r\nto London, the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, and to the English\r\ncity of York. The governors of the royal colony of Virginia felt\r\nempowered to refuse permission for the establishment of printing until\r\nthe year 1690, after which printers were governed by royal instructions\r\nwhich required a license and permission from the governor as a\r\nprerequisite to setting up shop.\r\n\r\nSir William Berkeley, who was governor of Virginia from 1642 to 1652 and\r\nagain from 1660 to 1677, summarized the attitude of most officials of\r\nhis day in his famous statement, “But, I thank God, there are no free\r\nschools nor printing, and I hope we shall not have these hundred years;\r\nfor learning has brought disobedience, and heresy, and sects into the\r\nworld, and printing has divulged them, and libels against the best\r\ngovernment. God keep us from both.” (Berkeley was in error: free schools\r\n_had_ existed in Virginia, though printing had not.)\r\n\r\nIn 1682, a few years after Berkeley wrote, a printer named William\r\nNuthead came to Jamestown, then the capital of Virginia, proposing to\r\nserve the government by printing the acts of the Assembly. He was\r\nordered by the Governor’s Council to await royal approval. Several\r\nmonths later a new governor arrived with an order from the king that “no\r\nperson be permitted to use any press for printing upon any occasion\r\nwhatsoever.” Nuthead moved to Maryland, and printing in Virginia was\r\ndelayed fifty years.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Title page of TYPOGRAPHIA, printed by William Parks\r\n    upon the establishment of his press in Williamsburg; reproduced from\r\n    the only surviving copy—in the John Carter Brown Library,\r\n    Providence, Rhode Island._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _TYPOGRAPHIA._\r\n                                   AN\r\n                                  ODE,\r\n                                   ON\r\n                               PRINTING.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Inſcrib’d to the Honourable\r\n                         WILLIAM GOOCH, ^_Eſq_;\r\n          His Majesty’s Lieutenant-Governor, and Commander in\r\n                  Chief of the Colony of   _VIRGINIA_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  —— _Pleni ſunt omnes Libri, plenæ ſapientum voces, plena Exemplorum\r\n  vetuﬅas; quæ jacerent in Tenebris omnia, niſi Literarum Lumen\r\n  accederet._\r\n                                                  Cic. Orat. pro Archia.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _WILLIAMSBURG:_\r\n                  Printed by William Parks. M,DCC,XXX.\r\n\r\nBefore 1730, however, a more tolerant attitude had developed. With the\r\npermission of Governor William Gooch, the English-born William Parks\r\nmoved that year from Annapolis to Williamsburg, which had succeeded\r\nJamestown as the capital of Virginia in 1699. He was designated public\r\nprinter of Virginia, at an annual salary of £120 a year, eventually\r\nincreased to £280. Parks continued to print the acts of the Virginia\r\nAssembly, which he had begun several years before in Maryland, and soon\r\nadvertised for subscriptions for a proposed _Virginia Miscellany_ “at\r\nhis House, near the Capitol, in Williamsburg.” Before the year was out\r\nhe had printed several works, at least five of which are known by title.\r\nOne of these is an ode to printing, _Typographia_, by one “J. Markland,”\r\nwhich salutes Gooch for his encouragement of printing. In the high-flown\r\nstyle of its day, the ode concludes:\r\n\r\n  “_A Ruler’s gentle Influence\r\n  Shall o’er his Land be shewn;\r\n  Saturnian Reigns shall be renew’d\r\n  Truth, Justice, Vertue, be pursu’d\r\n  Arts flourish, Peace shall crown the Plains,\r\n  Where GOOCH administers, AUGUSTUS reigns._”\r\n\r\nParks was Williamsburg’s most distinguished eighteenth-century printer\r\nand probably its most successful. In the annals of his craft in America\r\nhe is ranked with Benjamin Franklin and William Bradford, the foremost\r\nprinters in Pennsylvania and New York. Parks, like all of his brethren,\r\ndepended for his bread and butter on printing blank forms (deeds,\r\nmortgages, bills, and the like), government work (such as proclamations,\r\nforms, and laws), almanacs, and other job work, but he helped establish\r\nin the American colonies that dependence upon free and fair discussion\r\nof issues in the newspapers which strengthened the concept of a free\r\npress. He gave impetus to literature in a colony that had lacked the\r\nlocal means for its encouragement. By his example, he was partly\r\nresponsible for the rash of journalistic enterprise in pre-Revolutionary\r\nWilliamsburg.\r\n\r\nParks’s most influential act was his founding of the _Virginia Gazette_,\r\nthe first newspaper to be published in Virginia and the second south of\r\nMaryland. Begun in 1736, this weekly was the leader of a colorful\r\nsuccession of similarly named sheets in Williamsburg and later in\r\nRichmond, to which the Virginia government removed in 1780. And in these\r\n_Gazettes_—in the 1770s published by as many as three competing printers\r\nat a time—can be found a rich chronicle of the events in the colonies\r\nleading to the American Revolution. Important foreign and domestic\r\noccurrences were described in dispatches—perhaps taken in some cases\r\nfrom private correspondence—and in excerpts from other newspapers. The\r\neditor rarely reported local happenings beyond a brief mention of ship\r\narrivals, marriages, deaths, fires, and the like. He often printed legal\r\nnotices and entire acts of the Virginia Assembly, without comment.\r\nFulsomely phrased letters to the editor posed weighty questions of\r\ngovernment, science, or theology.\r\n\r\nThe modern reader will find the _Virginia Gazette_ of 1736 to 1750\r\nundramatic in its lack of headlines, pictures, and display type. But the\r\ningredients of human interest are there, subtly in the note of\r\ncontroversy which gradually built up to the Revolution, and emphatically\r\nin the advertisements, which largely financed the _Gazette_. Many are\r\nthe notices of runaway slaves, strayed farm animals, husbands deserted\r\nby wives, or blooded horses available for racing or breeding. From the\r\nadvertisements, also, the contemporary Virginia reader could learn of\r\nthe arrival of goods from London—articles of fashion that were highly\r\nprized by Virginians as evidence of their Englishness. In an early issue\r\nof the _Gazette_, Parks states:\r\n\r\n               “Advertisement, concerning Advertisements\r\n\r\n  “All Persons who have Occasion to buy or sell Houses, Lands, Goods, or\r\n  Cattle; or have Servants or Slaves Runaway; or have lost Horses,\r\n  Cattle, &c. or want to give any Publick Notice; may have it advertis’d\r\n  in all these _Gazettes_ printed in one Week, for Three Shillings, and\r\n  for Two Shillings _per_ Week for as many Weeks afterwards as they\r\n  shall order, by giving or sending their Directions to the _Printer_\r\n  hereof.\r\n\r\n  “And, as these Papers will circulate (as speedily as possible) not\r\n  only all over This, but also the Neighbouring Colonies, and will\r\n  probably be read by some Thousands of People, it is very likely they\r\n  may have the desir’d Effect; and it is certainly the cheapest and most\r\n  effectual Method that can be taken, for Publishing any Thing of this\r\n  Nature.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _PRINTING IN AN AGRICULTURAL ECONOMY_\r\n\r\nWilliam Parks’s significant achievements seem even greater if one\r\nunderstands the difficulties of operating a business in the Williamsburg\r\nof 1730-1750. Because Virginia’s colonial prosperity was based on a\r\none-crop economy—tobacco—little “ready money” was in circulation within\r\nthe colony. The weed itself became a sort of currency. The usual\r\npractice was for the plantation owner or the small farmer to subsist on\r\nhis produce and his credit until the crop was harvested and shipped to\r\nEnglish merchants, who from the proceeds of its sale bought for the\r\nplanter such articles as he had directed. Because all American tobacco\r\nwas transported to Britain in British vessels, shipping space was\r\nplentiful on the westward passage, and shipowners and British merchants\r\noffered Virginia buyers cheap freight rates on finished goods. Thus such\r\nEnglish manufactures as cloth, furniture, pewter, silver, and ceramics\r\nwere sold to Virginia planters and merchants.\r\n\r\nThe two-way trade between Virginia planters and British merchants slowed\r\ndown the development of a large Virginia artisan group. Accordingly,\r\nlocal industry was limited in eighteenth-century Virginia, even in an\r\nurban center such as Williamsburg. Virginia craftsmen complained\r\nbitterly of unpaid accounts, the necessity of accepting such “country\r\npay” as tobacco, corn, and beef, and the paucity of buyers who offered\r\nready money.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand why William Parks found relatively few\r\ncraftsmen in the Williamsburg of his day. Except for a few trades such\r\nas cabinetmaking, blacksmithing, coopering, wigmaking, tailoring, and\r\nshoemaking, the Virginia capital was largely a community of taverns,\r\ntownhouses, and governmental institutions, and the colony itself was\r\noverwhelmingly rural. There is no doubt that Virginia’s reliance on\r\nagriculture, a reliance approved by British mercantile theory, resulted\r\nin an overdependence on the industry of the mother country. We can thank\r\nthe peculiarities of Parks’s situation—the inability of English printers\r\nto satisfy Virginians’ desire for regional news, and the subsidy Parks\r\nreceived as public printer—that his craft became firmly established in\r\nthe 1730s in Virginia. Indeed, it seems clear that the prospect of\r\nbecoming Virginia’s public printer was what lured Parks from Annapolis\r\nto Williamsburg in the first place.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  _PARKS’S SUCCESSORS IN WILLIAMSBURG_\r\n\r\nAltogether, Williamsburg had at least twelve master printers and three\r\nseparate printing locations or offices during the colonial period. After\r\nParks died on a voyage to England, William Hunter, the man whom he had\r\nleft in charge, bought the business. Publication of the _Virginia\r\nGazette_ continued, and Hunter became public printer and postmaster. In\r\nthe latter capacity he worked in close association with an astute\r\nPhiladelphia printer, Benjamin Franklin, with whom he served jointly as\r\ndeputy postmaster-general for all the colonies. Hunter printed in 1754\r\nthe first published writing of George Washington, entitled _The Journal\r\nof Major George Washington, sent by the Hon. Robert Dinwiddie, Esq; His\r\nMajesty’s Lieutenant-Governor, and Commander in Chief of Virginia, to\r\nthe Commandant of the French Forces on Ohio...._\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Masthead of Purdie’s VIRGINIA GAZETTE before the\r\n    adoption of the Virginia Resolution for American Independence on May\r\n    15, 1776, by the Virginia Convention of Delegates meeting at the\r\n    Capitol in Williamsburg._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      May 10, 1776.

As tension increased between Great Britain and her\r\nAmerican colonies, especially after the adoption of the Stamp Act in\r\n1765, the relation of public printer to government became more\r\ndifficult. The printer faced the necessity of maintaining good relations\r\nwith both loyalist and patriot elements in the House of Burgesses. One\r\nloyalist reader of the _Gazette_, the Reverend John Camm, complained in\r\nthe early 1760s that Hunter’s successor, Joseph Royle, refused to\r\npublish Camm’s pamphlet arguing the cause of Church of England clergymen\r\nbecause of its “Satyrical Touches upon the Late Assembly.” On the other\r\nhand, certain patriot members criticized Royle in the columns of the\r\n_Maryland Gazette_ for allegedly refusing to print their criticisms of\r\nlocal government. The printer was caught between fires.\r\n\r\nCriticism of the _Gazette_ continued after Royle died in January 1766,\r\nand Alexander Purdie, a Scotsman, took over the business. In what is\r\nthought to have been his first issue, Purdie announced that “the press\r\nshall likewise be as free as any Gentleman can wish, or desire; and I\r\ncrave the countenance and favour of the publick no longer than my\r\nconduct may appear to merit their approbation.” Later the same month,\r\nPurdie wrote, “As I understand it is thought by some that I have\r\nneglected, or refused, to publish the account of a late transaction at\r\nHobb’s Hole [Tappahannock], this is to assure the publick ... that I\r\nnever saw the same, nor was it ever offered to me to publish, otherwise\r\nit would have seen the light before this time: For I do now, as I have\r\nheretofore declared, that my press shall be as free as any Gentleman can\r\nwish or desire; that is, as free as any publick press upon the\r\ncontinent.” In 1775, after Purdie established another _Virginia\r\nGazette_, his paper bore the appealing motto “Always for Liberty, and\r\nthe Publick Good.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _TOWARD A FREE PRESS_\r\n\r\nIn spite of Purdie’s efforts, the trend was toward a competitive press.\r\nA rival _Virginia Gazette_ was set up in Williamsburg in 1766 by William\r\nRind, a Maryland printer who was more sympathetic to the protesting\r\ncolonists than Royle and Purdie were thought to be. The motto of his\r\npaper cannily proclaimed “Open to all Parties but influenced by None.”\r\nGovernor Francis Fauquier at this time reported to the British Board of\r\nTrade: “The late printer to the Colony [Royle] is dead, and as the press\r\nwas then thought to be too complaisant to me, some of the hot Burgesses\r\ninvited a printer [Rind] from Maryland. Upon which the foreman [Purdie]\r\nto the late printer, who is also a candidate for the place, has taken up\r\nthe newspaper again in order to make interest with the Burgesses.”\r\nJefferson, who in 1766 was completing his study of law, and was a friend\r\nand admirer of Fauquier’s, recalled later: “We had but one press, and\r\nthat having the whole business of the government, and no competitor for\r\npublic favor, nothing disagreeable to the governor could be got into it.\r\nWe procured Rind to come from Maryland to publish a free paper.”\r\n\r\nThe hot-spirited Rind was elected public printer by the House of\r\nBurgesses. However, the job being too much for one printer alone, the\r\nAssembly in 1769 authorized both _Gazette_ publishers, Rind and Purdie,\r\nto print a large volume containing the Acts of Assembly then in force.\r\nRind continued in office until his death in 1773 when his widow,\r\nClementina Rind, took over the business as Virginia’s first woman\r\nprinter.\r\n\r\nThe number of weekly newspapers in Williamsburg increased again in 1775\r\nwhen Purdie, who had taken John Dixon into his business nine years\r\nbefore, withdrew in favor of William Hunter, Jr., the son of William\r\nParks’s successor, and established his own _Virginia Gazette_. When the\r\nRevolution broke in 1776, Williamsburg thus had three newspapers, each\r\ncalled the _Virginia Gazette_. Rind’s _Gazette_ expired by 1777, after a\r\nsuccession of managers, and Purdie’s (which was continued after his\r\ndeath in 1779 by Clarkson and Davis) ceased publication in 1780. Dixon\r\nformed a new partnership with Thomas Nicolson in 1779 after William\r\nHunter, Jr., had joined the British forces. Their newspaper was called\r\nthe _Phoenix Gazette and Williamsburg Intelligencer_, but it expired the\r\nfollowing year when these printers followed the seat of government to\r\nestablish Richmond’s first press.\r\n\r\nSo pronounced was the decline in Williamsburg’s fortunes that from the\r\nyear of the government’s removal until forty-four years later, in 1824,\r\nWilliamsburg had no newspaper. Old copies of the three _Gazettes_ were\r\ntreasured reminders of the town’s past glory. The name, _Virginia\r\nGazette_, and some of the tradition of Parks’s skill were remembered,\r\nbut little was done to perpetuate them until the late Dr. W. A. R.\r\nGoodwin in 1926 invited Mr. John D. Rockefeller, Jr., to restore\r\nWilliamsburg. As a by-product of that movement, the proud masthead of\r\nWilliam Parks’s original _Virginia Gazette_ was revived in 1930 by the\r\nlate Joseph A. Osborne and his family. Likewise, in the realm of paper\r\nmanufacture, typography, book production, and bookbinding, Colonial\r\nWilliamsburg has revived the workmanship of William Parks and his\r\nconfreres. In such publications as _The Williamsburg Art of Cookery, or,\r\nAccomplish’d Gentlewoman’s Companion_, published in 1938, and _A Brief &\r\nTrue Report concerning Williamsburg in Virginia_, first published in\r\n1935, Colonial Williamsburg emulated type, paper, format, and binding of\r\nsimilar volumes from Parks’s press. And at its Printing Office, it has\r\nsought to recapture the manner and mood of a colonial printing shop as a\r\npart of its program to teach twentieth-century Americans more about the\r\nlives and ideas of their pre-Revolutionary ancestors.\r\n\r\n\r\n              _TECHNIQUES OF EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY PRINTING_\r\n\r\nIn considering the craft of printing, it is important to remember that\r\nthe western world has enjoyed the invention of movable type only since\r\nthe middle of the fifteenth century. For several centuries thereafter,\r\nthe new development was regarded with suspicion by church and state,\r\nwhich, as we have seen, feared the freedom of thought that would ensue\r\nif reading matter were readily available. Even in the eighteenth\r\ncentury, an era of enlightenment, printing was suspect.\r\n\r\nAn equally difficult obstacle facing the colonial printer was the cost\r\nof his press, his type, his paper, and his equipment. Eighteenth-century\r\nindustry was largely home operated, based on the capital and ingenuity\r\nof one family. Yet the cost of equipping even the modest one- or\r\ntwo-press shops of eighteenth-century America was a burden for most\r\npeople of the working class. In his famous _Autobiography_, Benjamin\r\nFranklin gives a vivid picture of the immense labor and thought that lay\r\nbetween a printer’s apprenticeship and ownership. To reach the level of\r\nsuccess that Franklin and Parks achieved required not only skill but\r\nunusual industry and shrewdness.\r\n\r\nEighteenth-century appraisals of several printing houses indicate an\r\naverage value of £100 to £125 currency. We may suppose that William\r\nParks set up shop in Williamsburg in 1730 on some such scale as this,\r\nadding type and other equipment to the value of £359 Virginia currency\r\nor £288 sterling at the time his equipment was sold to William Hunter in\r\n1751. Undoubtedly Parks’s three presses and his type constituted his\r\nchief equipment. The presses presumably were of the English common sort,\r\nwhich had then been in standard use in the British Isles for nearly one\r\nhundred years. The type was an alloy of lead, tin, and antimony, the\r\nletters having been cast in Holland or England, and probably was valued\r\nat more than the rest of Parks’s facilities together. For the rest,\r\nequipment consisted of such printers’ staples as poles for drying paper,\r\n“shooting sticks,” quoins, planes, type cases, type racks, composing\r\nsticks, lye troughs, wetting troughs, and other paraphernalia. For\r\nbookbinding the printer needed other instruments, some of which could be\r\nmade in Williamsburg. The majority of the tools, however, were imported\r\nfrom Great Britain or Holland.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _A paper mill.

(6) Details of the vat._ DIDEROT.]\r\n\r\nAs he received each font or size of type, the colonial printer would\r\ndistribute it in a set of four wooden trays, two for Roman type and two\r\nfor italic. These contained partitions for each “character,” or “sort,”\r\nas the letters and numerals were called. Such partitions varied in size\r\ndepending on the frequency of use of each letter or numeral, and they\r\nwere so placed as to permit the printer to assemble type with a minimum\r\nof movement. (Because capital letters are usually arranged in the upper\r\ntwo cases and small letters in the lower two, printers traditionally\r\nrefer to them as “upper case” or “lower case,” respectively.)\r\n\r\nIn setting a page of printed matter the colonial printer rapidly plucked\r\nthe necessary characters, one by one, from their compartments in the\r\nupper and lower cases. He placed them, with proper spacing, in a\r\n“composing stick” set to the proper length of line. When the stick was\r\nfull he transferred the type to a shallow wooden tray called a “galley.”\r\nHaving assembled in the galley enough type to form a page, the printer\r\n“tied it off,” i.e., bound a piece of string tightly around the whole\r\nmass. Then he could slide the assembled page off the galley onto the\r\nsurface of the “imposing stone,” a flat marble working surface. Such\r\ntransfers of type—especially from composing stick to galley—were often\r\nattended with accidents. One of the printer’s commoner frustrations was\r\nto have a stick, a galley, or even a whole page form of type dropped and\r\n“pied.”\r\n\r\nOn the imposing stone a rectangular wrought-iron frame or “chase” was\r\nthen placed around the type, and the finished page was locked into place\r\nwith wooden blocks and wedges called “furniture” and “quoins.” After\r\nbeing locked, it could be picked up and moved to the printing press\r\nwithout danger of the type falling out of place.\r\n\r\nThe eighteenth-century printer used paper made by hand from linen rags,\r\nimporting it from Great Britain in the earlier years while domestic\r\nmills were gradually developing. Because such paper was uneven in\r\ntexture and poorly sized, it was dampened before being put on the press\r\nto provide a more pliant working surface. For ink, Parks and his\r\ncontemporaries used a combination of lampblack and varnish, which remain\r\nthe chief constituents of printer’s ink today. Lampblack was obtained by\r\nburning various materials and collecting the carbon in flues, while\r\nvarnish was made of pine resin boiled in linseed oil until a clear\r\nliquid resulted. Most printers “rubbed” or mixed the lampblack and\r\nvarnish thoroughly. If the mixture was too thick, it could be thinned\r\nwith linseed oil or whale oil. If red ink was desired for two-color\r\nprinting, vermilion could be substituted for lampblack.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _A view of a typical eighteenth-century printer’s\r\n    composing room. Here type was set by hand to be printed on the\r\n    press. (1) Setting type in a composing stick. (2) Transferring a\r\n    stick of set type to a galley.

The puller and beater are\r\n    shown in two stages of the operations. On the left, a sheet of paper\r\n    is placed on the tympan by the puller, and the type is inked by the\r\n    beater. On the right, the puller is printing an impression on the\r\n    paper, and the beater is distributing ink on his stocks while he\r\n    inspects the previous pull._ DIDEROT.]\r\n\r\nOnce the printer or his apprentices had set the type, pulled a proof,\r\n“made up” the type into pages with the proper spacing and ornaments, and\r\nthen locked it into forms by means of furniture and quoins, he placed\r\nhis form on the press and adjusted it to get the most even impression.\r\nThen he was ready to begin the actual process of printing. Whereas\r\nprinting is commonly done today by automatic presses, fed with paper\r\neither mechanically or by hand, it had to be done one sheet at a time in\r\nthe eighteenth century. Two men usually worked the press, and the\r\nprinting of a single impression required approximately a dozen different\r\nmanual operations.\r\n\r\nTo ink his press, preparatory to printing, the “beater” spread the\r\nnecessary amount of ink on his mixing block and rubbed it to an even\r\nconsistency—that of stiff molasses—with a wooden brayer. With two\r\nleather-covered balls attached to wooden handles, he then collected ink\r\nfrom the stone, beat the “ink balls” together to distribute the sticky\r\nfluid over their surfaces, and then with a rapid rocking and rolling\r\nmotion, transferred it onto the type. Then the “puller” placed his paper\r\non a skin-covered wooden frame called a tympan and folded over it\r\nanother light covered frame, called a frisket. These two frames in turn\r\nfolded down onto the bed of the press, where the type was locked in its\r\niron form or chase.\r\n\r\nThe actual impression was made by rolling the bed of the press, complete\r\nwith folded tympan and frisket, beneath the platen, which was suspended\r\nfrom a large metal screw. By applying the force of the screw, the puller\r\npressed the paper firmly against the inked type. The size of the printed\r\nmatter might vary from a small bookplate or lottery ticket to a sheet\r\ntwelve by eighteen inches, which was roughly the page size of Purdie and\r\nDixon’s _Virginia Gazette_ of 1759. Whatever the dimension, the beater\r\nhad to ink his form and the puller had to close and open his press again\r\neach time a surface was printed. Since the platen was so small, only\r\none-half of a two-page wide newspaper could be printed at a time on the\r\nearly press, and a repeat operation was required to complete one side of\r\nthe sheet. Thus the press was sometimes called a “two-pull” press.\r\n\r\nTwo experienced pressmen, working at full speed, could turn out a\r\n“token” or 240 printed sheets (with two pulls and on one side only) per\r\nhour. Such a speed could not long be maintained; the practical output\r\nwas closer to 200 sheets per hour. But wages were low, working hours\r\nwere long, and the printer could keep his force on the job until the\r\nwork was done.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _THE PRINTER AND HIS MEN_\r\n\r\nBecause of its close association with literature, the craft of printing\r\nhas generally attracted a more intellectual type of craftsman and\r\nenjoyed a prestige greater than most others. Over the centuries, master\r\nprinters have jealously enforced the standards of their predecessors,\r\ninsisting today, as in the eighteenth century, on a long apprenticeship\r\nfor learners. Upon completion of the stipulated learning period and\r\nachievement of the required proficiency, the apprentice then, as now,\r\nbecame a journeyman. A mature and experienced worker at this stage, he\r\nwas qualified to take his leave of his master, if he desired, and to\r\npractice his craft where he wished. When such a printer engaged in work\r\nfor himself and employed others, he became a master printer.\r\n\r\nThe apprentice system was in some respects a great boon to\r\neighteenth-century craftsmen, for it provided cheap labor in return only\r\nfor training and the necessities of life. Each master took into his\r\nestablishment a number of youngsters, hoping that some might prove of\r\n“bright genius and good disposition.” To these he obligated himself to\r\nprovide food, shelter, and in most cases, clothing. The apprentice\r\nthereupon became a member of the printer’s household, performing any\r\nchores assigned to him in the home, shop, or printing office. But\r\nalthough apprentice labor was cheap, it was unskilled and often inept.\r\nApprenticeships were frequently broken off, and only the relatively few\r\nyouths who were suited for the work and desirous of learning the “art\r\nand mystery” of the craft kept at it until accepted as journeymen at the\r\nage of twenty-one.\r\n\r\nMany accounts have come down to us of the abuses as well as the uses of\r\nthe apprentice system. Runaways were frequent, as attested by\r\nadvertisements such as the one William Parks ran in the _Virginia\r\nGazette_ in 1745 for the return of a “smooth-tongued” apprentice “who\r\nmakes Locks, and is dexterous at picking them.” Sometimes mere children\r\nwere apprenticed by poorer families who were unable to support them.\r\nIsaiah Thomas, a New England printer, was indentured at the age of six.\r\nIn return for his training and keep, he bound himself to avoid\r\ndrunkenness and carnal pursuits and to serve his master until he became\r\ntwenty-one. However, the majority of apprentices were indentured at\r\nfourteen, to serve until they reached man’s estate.\r\n\r\nThe apprentice system largely supplied the printer’s need for unskilled\r\nlabor, but he could supplement it with slaves or with indentured\r\nservants. The latter were usually young Englishmen of the lower classes\r\nwho had emigrated to America and who had bound themselves to a term of\r\nlabor in return for their voyage. Unlike apprentices, however, they were\r\nnot required to be taught to print.\r\n\r\nTrained, or journeymen, printers were scarce in colonial times, and they\r\nseem to have been often on the go. Even master printers moved about\r\nfrequently. William Parks had engaged in printing in three English towns\r\nand in Annapolis before coming to Williamsburg in 1730. William Rind,\r\nwho established his paper in Williamsburg in 1766, came there from\r\nAnnapolis. Of Williamsburg’s other master printers and journeymen, some\r\nwere locally trained but others had been apprenticed in England.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _A NOTE ON THE PRINTING OFFICE_\r\n\r\nAlthough the Printing Office of Colonial Williamsburg does not attempt\r\nprecisely to re-create any particular colonial printing shop, it does\r\nrepresent the craft as it was practiced in the mid-1700s. Here the\r\ntwentieth-century American is invited to pause and look about him.\r\nPerhaps, if he is in a receptive mood, he may sense the spirit of the\r\ntalented William Parks, keeping a watchful eye over apprentices and\r\njourneymen while type is set, presses are inked, and impressions are\r\npulled from the press. Perhaps he can discern some Virginia planter\r\nmaking his way to Parks’s bookshelf, to buy Allestree’s _The Whole Duty\r\nof Man_ or Bayly’s _The Practice of Piety_ to take with him to his\r\nplantation and read during winter evenings.\r\n\r\nEntering the Printing Office, the visitor finds himself in a typical\r\nWilliamsburg structure of the eighteenth century. Fireplaces on each\r\nfloor of the shop warm the workers in cold weather and dry the printed\r\nsheets of paper hung on overhead racks. Many-paned windows provide most\r\nof the shop’s illumination during daylight hours, and also a place—in\r\nthe bays on Duke of Gloucester Street—for the printer to post signs and\r\nsamples of his work. At night and on dark days candelabra hanging from\r\nthe ceiling and tin sconces against the walls hold candles whose smoky\r\nflames blacken the plaster as they help to light the working areas.\r\n\r\nOn the street floor are the post office, stationery, and bookselling\r\ncounter—one of the important areas of the normal colonial printing\r\noffice, since it combined three of the most important sidelines. Along\r\nwith the shelves of books for sale, some bound in leather and some in\r\ntemporary paper covers, there is a mail rack with slots for letters and\r\nnewspapers.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _A bookbindery. In this view, several important\r\n    binding operations can be seen. (a) Beating folded sections of a\r\n    book so that they will lie flat.

Eighteenth-century printers often engaged in several other\r\nbusinesses at the same time—importing goods of almost any kind, selling\r\nfarm products on commission, and trying anything that might turn a\r\npenny.\r\n\r\nExcavation of the Printing Office site and careful study of the\r\nsurviving eighteenth-century foundations and brick flooring gave\r\nevidence—in the form of reinforced footings—as to where at least one\r\npress may have stood. This was in the lower floor of the building, where\r\nagain today the shop’s printing operation is concentrated. There the\r\nthree presses mentioned earlier occupy the center of the room, all of\r\nthem in working order. Large racks for the storage of type line the\r\nwall, surmounted by open, slanting cases of type in current use. The\r\ncases contain a complete set of Caslon letters, from the diminutive\r\nNonpareil (6-point) to Six Line Pica (72-point), which is one inch tall.\r\nUsually the printer employs the Pica (12-point) and English (14-point)\r\nsizes, which were customarily used in colonial times. He and his\r\ncolleagues identified type sizes by name only; since the present point\r\nsystem was not in use then.\r\n\r\nPrinter’s ink and its ingredients—varnish, lampblack or vermilion, and\r\nlinseed oil—are kept in saltglaze jugs. Other vessels contain drinking\r\nwater, and the wetting trough is filled, ready for dampening paper\r\nbefore printing. On the floor, weighted boards atop stacks of wetted\r\npaper keep the sheets from curling as the dampness permeates evenly\r\nthroughout the pile.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Title page of AN INQUIRY ..., printed by Alexander\r\n    Purdie.

The printed sheets, in the meantime,\r\nmay have to be hung on ceiling racks to allow both ink and paper to dry\r\nout.\r\n\r\nIn the small back shop, a separate building, the similarly cluttered\r\nbookbinding shop may be found. In it the bookbinder of today, working\r\nwith the tools and methods of his eighteenth-century predecessors, sews\r\ntogether the printed and folded signatures that make a book, binds them\r\nin boards, and covers the boards—perhaps in elegantly decorated leather\r\nbindings. He may use marbled paper of his own making for end-papers or\r\non the outer covers of smaller books. For tooling and lettering the\r\ncover he has a collection of brass dies, some of which are designed from\r\nlettering stamps excavated in the vicinity of his—and William Parks’s\r\nworkshop.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _OUR PRINTING HERITAGE_\r\n\r\nFrom the crude presses of Williamsburg came an ingredient essential to\r\nthe movement toward American self-government and independence—the\r\npolitical pamphlet. In the world of the eighteenth century, devoid of\r\nradio, television, or the bulky daily paper, the substance of political\r\ndebate came from such pamphlets. It was also an era which took its\r\npolitical philosophy seriously, and the author of a pamphlet could count\r\non wide readership among the planter-aristocrats who controlled the\r\nmachinery of government. Williamsburg, as the colony’s capital and its\r\npolitical and intellectual center, was the obvious city to lend its\r\nimprint to the speculations of Virginia’s pamphleteers.\r\n\r\nOne of the most significant early tracts was Richard Bland’s _An Inquiry\r\ninto the Rights of the British Colonies_, printed by Alexander Purdie in\r\nMarch 1766. Writing in the aftermath of the previous year’s fiery Stamp\r\nTax debates, Bland vigorously proclaimed his belief in Locke’s doctrines\r\nof natural rights and natural law. Reprinted in London, Bland’s tract\r\nwas evidence of the mounting sentiment for self-rule in the colonies.\r\nBland’s _Inquiry_ was also a memorial to its author, a man who devoted\r\nmuch of his life to public service. An aged delegate to Virginia’s first\r\nstate legislature in October 1776, Bland collapsed in the Williamsburg\r\nstreets on his way to a session, and died hours later in the home of his\r\nfriend, John Tazewell.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Jefferson’s SUMMARY VIEW, from the press of\r\n    Williamsburg’s only woman printer.

Printed by Clementina Rind, this is an example of the\r\n    type of document not readily accepted by some Williamsburg printers\r\n    and for which the Rinds were encouraged to establish themselves in\r\n    the eighteenth-century Virginia capital._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   A\r\n                              SUMMARY VIEW\r\n                                 OF THE\r\n                                 RIGHTS\r\n                                   OF\r\n                            BRITISH AMERICA.\r\n                           SET FORTH IN SOME\r\n                              RESOLUTIONS\r\n                            INTENDED FOR THE\r\n                               INSPECTION\r\n                             OF THE PRESENT\r\n                               DELEGATES\r\n                                 OF THE\r\n                          PEOPLE OF VIRGINIA.\r\n                                 NOW IN\r\n                              CONVENTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     By a NATIVE, and MEMBER of the\r\n                          HOUSE of BURGESSES.\r\n                         _by Thomas Jefferson._\r\n\r\n\r\n                             WILLIAMSBURG:\r\n                      Printed BY CLEMENTINA RIND.\r\n\r\nThe most important pamphlet printed in Williamsburg was _A Summary View\r\nof the Rights of British America_, from the pen of Thomas Jefferson.\r\nLying ill up-country in August of 1774, when Virginia’s legislators were\r\nconvened in Williamsburg to send off delegates for the First Continental\r\nCongress, Jefferson wrote his tract to suggest instructions that might\r\nguide these delegates at Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nThe _Summary View_ was read aloud by Peyton Randolph in his home on\r\nMarket Square to a room filled with Virginia patriots. It was too\r\nradical for some, but moving to all. It was at once set in type by\r\nClementina Rind, Williamsburg’s only woman printer. Among the first to\r\npurchase a copy was George Washington, who noted in his diary that it\r\ncost him three shillings ninepence. The pamphlet was reprinted in\r\nPhiladelphia and London and has been described as second only to the\r\nDeclaration of Independence in charting the American course toward\r\nindependence. John Adams of Massachusetts testified that the _Summary\r\nView_ gave Jefferson “the reputation of a masterly pen” among Congress\r\ndelegates in 1776 and won for the Virginian his assignment to draft the\r\nDeclaration.\r\n\r\nTo the Williamsburg printer we owe a word of thanks for the important\r\npart that he has played in the affairs of this early Virginia\r\ncapital—affairs that had notable influence on the course of American\r\nhistory. Since civilization began, the communication of ideas has\r\nlargely depended upon the written word. The eighteenth-century printers\r\nof Williamsburg—and all America—served that need at a time of great\r\nmoment, when the destiny of the emerging ideals of political democracy,\r\nfree speech, a free press, and freedom of conscience was uncertain. They\r\nhad the privilege of enlisting their craftsmanship in the service of\r\nfreedom, peace, and plenty, goals that continue to beckon mankind.\r\n\r\nTo the printer’s art, then, we wholeheartedly render the tribute which\r\nJ. Markland pronounced in _Typographia_, in 1730, as he saluted Governor\r\nGooch and Printer Parks for giving Virginia its first press:\r\n\r\n        “_Happy the Art, by which we learn\r\n        Gloss of Errors to detect,\r\n        The Vice of Habits to correct,\r\n  And sacred Truths, from Falsehood to discern!\r\n        By which we take a far-stretch’d View,\r\n  And learn our Fathers Vertues to pursue,\r\n        Their Follies to eschew._”\r\n              _1730-1780_\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Decorative footer.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Decorative header.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _The Master Printers of_ Williamsburg\r\n                              _1730-1780_\r\n\r\n\r\n1730-1750 _William Parks._ Printer and publisher in three English towns\r\n      and in Annapolis before he opened the first printing office in\r\n      Williamsburg in 1730; founded the _Virginia Gazette_ in 1736; died\r\n      in 1750.\r\n\r\n1751-1761 _William Hunter._ Probably learned printing as an apprentice\r\n      to Parks, whose foreman he became; bought the printing office from\r\n      Parks’s estate in 1751; was jointly with Franklin deputy\r\n      postmaster-general for the colonies from 1753 until his death in\r\n      1761.\r\n\r\n1761-1766 _Joseph Royle._ Born in England; became Hunter’s foreman about\r\n      1758 and married Hunter’s sister; co-legatee, with Hunter’s minor\r\n      son, of the printing business; died in 1766.\r\n\r\n1766-1773 _William Rind._ Came from Maryland to Williamsburg in 1766 on\r\n      the invitation of Jefferson and other “hot Burgesses” who thought\r\n      Royle too submissive to the governor; established a rival\r\n      _Virginia Gazette_ and continued it until he died in 1773.\r\n\r\n1766-1779 _Alexander Purdie._ Born and trained in Scotland; was foreman\r\n      to Royle, whose will bequeathed him an interest in the business\r\n      along with Royle’s minor son and William Hunter, Jr.; took John\r\n      Dixon as partner, and himself stepped out when young Hunter came\r\n      of age in 1774; established a new printing office and issued a\r\n      third _Virginia Gazette_ until his death in 1779.\r\n\r\n1766-1780 _John Dixon._ Had been Royle’s business manager before the\r\n      latter’s death, and thereafter married his widow; partner in turn\r\n      of Purdie, William Hunter, Jr., and Thomas Nicolson; moved to\r\n      Richmond in 1780.\r\n\r\n1773-1774 _Clementina Rind._ Widow of William Rind; continued his\r\n      printing business for one year—from his death in 1773 until her\r\n      own in 1774.\r\n\r\n1774-1777 _John Pinkney._ Continued the Rind printing business and\r\n      _Gazette_ on behalf of the Rind children from Clementina’s death\r\n      until some time in 1777.\r\n\r\n1775-1777 _William Hunter Jr._ Natural son of William Sr., who\r\n      bequeathed him the printing shop, lot, and half-interest in the\r\n      business; on coming of age became active partner of Dixon;\r\n      partnership dissolved in 1777; Hunter, a loyalist, followed\r\n      Cornwallis to Yorktown in 1781 and thence to exile.\r\n\r\n1779-1780 _Thomas Nicolson._ Succeeded William Hunter, Jr., as Dixon’s\r\n      partner in 1779; the firm moved to Richmond the following year.\r\n\r\n1779-1780 _John Clarkson._ Nephew of Alexander Purdie; continued\r\n      Purdie’s _Gazette_ and printing business for about a year in\r\n      partnership with Augustine Davis.\r\n\r\n1779-1780 _Augustine Davis._ Had been one of Purdie’s printers; with\r\n      Clarkson continued as successor to Purdie until 1780.\r\n\r\n  _Henry Bowcock_, _William Stark_, and _Robert Miller_ were connected\r\n  with printing in Williamsburg during the years 1730-1780, but it is\r\n  not known in what capacity.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Decorative header.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   _Suggestions for Further Reading_\r\n\r\n\r\nBernard Bailyn, ed., _Pamphlets of the American Revolution, 1750-1776_.\r\n      Vol. I: _1750-1765_.
