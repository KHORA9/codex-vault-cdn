C. HALL, F.S.A.\r\n\r\nComplete in Two Series.\r\n\r\nIllustrated with Three Hundred and Eighty Engravings on Wood\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNew York\r\nA. W. Lovering, Importer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nENGLAND is rich—immeasurably richer than any other country under the\r\nsun—in its “Homes;” and these homes, whether of the sovereign or of\r\nthe high nobility, of the country squire or the merchant-prince, of the\r\nartisan or the labourer, whether, in fact, they are palace or cottage,\r\nor of any intermediate grade, have a character possessed by none other.\r\nEngland, whose\r\n\r\n  “Home! sweet home!”\r\n\r\nhas become almost a national anthem—so closely is its sentiment\r\nentwined around the hearts of the people of every class—is, indeed,\r\nemphatically a Kingdom of Homes; and these, and their associations and\r\nsurroundings, and the love which is felt for them, are its main source\r\nof true greatness. An Englishman feels, wherever he may be, that\r\n\r\n  “Home _is_ home, however lowly;”\r\n\r\nand that, despite the attractions of other countries and the glare and\r\nbrilliancy of foreign courts and foreign phases of society, after all\r\n\r\n  “There’s no place like home”\r\n\r\nin his own old fatherland.\r\n\r\nBeautifully has the gifted poet, Mrs. Hemans, sung of English “Homes,”\r\nand charmingly has she said—\r\n\r\n  “The Stately Homes of England,\r\n    How beautiful they stand\r\n  Amidst their tall ancestral trees\r\n    O’er all the pleasant land!”\r\n\r\nand thus given to us a title for our present work. Of these “Stately\r\nHomes” of our “pleasant land” we have chosen some few for illustration,\r\nnot for their stateliness alone, but because the true nobility of\r\ntheir owners allows their beauties, their splendour, their picturesque\r\nsurroundings, and their treasures of art to be seen and enjoyed by all.\r\n\r\nWhether “stately” in their proportions or in their style of\r\narchitecture, in their internal decorations or their outward\r\nsurroundings, in the halo of historical associations which encircle\r\nthem, or in the families which have made their greatness, and whose\r\nhigh and noble characters have given them an enduring interest, these\r\n“Homes” are indeed a fitting and pleasant subject for pen and pencil.\r\nThe task of their illustration has been a peculiarly grateful one to\r\nus, and we have accomplished it with loving hands, and with a sincere\r\ndesire to make our work acceptable to a large number of readers.\r\n\r\nIn the first instance, our notices of these “Stately Homes” appeared in\r\nthe pages of the _Art-Journal_, for which, indeed, they were specially\r\nprepared, with the ultimate intention, now carried out, of issuing them\r\nin a collected form. They have, however, now been rearranged, and have\r\nreceived considerable, and in many instances very important, additions.\r\nThe present volume may be looked upon as the first of a short series\r\nof volumes devoted to this pleasant and fascinating subject; others\r\nof a similar character, embracing many equally beautiful, equally\r\ninteresting, and equally “stately” Homes will follow.\r\n\r\n  LLEWELLYNN JEWITT.\r\n\r\n  WINSTER HALL, DERBYSHIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS OF FIRST SERIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                          PAGE\r\n\r\n     I.—ALTON

TOWERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWE commence this series with ALTON TOWERS, one of the most interesting\r\nof the many Stately Homes of England that dignify and glorify the\r\nKingdom; deriving interest not alone from architectural grandeur and\r\nthe picturesque and beautiful scenery by which it is environed, but as\r\na perpetual reminder of a glorious past—its associations being closely\r\nallied with the leading heroes and worthies of our country.\r\n\r\nThe Laureate asks, apparently in a tone of reproach—\r\n\r\n            “Why don’t these acred sirs\r\n  Throw up their parks some dozen times a year,\r\n  And let the people breathe?”\r\n\r\nThe poet cannot be aware that a very large number of the “parks” of\r\nthe nobility and gentry of England are “thrown up” not a “dozen times”\r\nbut a hundred times in every year; and that, frequently, thousands of\r\n“the people” breathe therein—as free to all the enjoyments they supply\r\nas the owners themselves. Generally, also, on fixed days, the chief\r\nrooms, such as are highly decorated or contain pictures—the STATE\r\nAPARTMENTS—are open also; and all that wealth has procured, as far as\r\nthe eye is concerned, is as much the property of the humblest artisan\r\nas it is of the lord of the soil.\r\n\r\nAnd what a boon it is to the sons and daughters of toil—the\r\nhard-handed men—with their wives and children—workers at the forge,\r\nthe wheel, and the loom,—who thus make holiday, obtain enjoyment,\r\nand gain health, under the shadows of “tall ancestral trees” planted\r\ncenturies ago by men whose names are histories.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Ruins of Alton Castle._]\r\n\r\nIndeed a closed park, and a shut-up mansion, are, now, not the rule,\r\nbut the exception; the noble or wealthy seem eager to share their\r\nacquisitions with the people; and continually, as at Alton Towers,\r\npicturesque and comfortable “summer houses” have been erected for the\r\nease, shelter, and refreshment of all comers. Visitors of any rank or\r\ngrade are permitted to wander where they will, and it is gratifying\r\nto add, that very rarely has any evil followed such license. At Alton\r\nTowers, a few shillings usually pays the cost consequent upon an inroad\r\nof four thousand modern “iconoclasts:” the grounds being frequently\r\nvisited by so many in one day.\r\n\r\nThe good that hence arises is incalculable: it removes the barriers\r\nthat separate the rich from the poor, the peer from the peasant, the\r\nmagnate from the labourer; and contributes to propagate and confirm the\r\ntrue patriotism that arises from holy love of country.\r\n\r\nAlton, Alveton, Elveton, or Aulton, was held by the Crown at the\r\ntime of taking the Domesday survey, but, it would appear, afterwards\r\nreverted to its original holders; Rohesia, the only child of the last\r\nof whom, brought Alton, by marriage, to Bertram de Verdon, who had been\r\npreviously married to Maude, daughter of Robert de Ferrars, first Earl\r\nof Derby. Alveton thus became the _caput baroniæ_ of the Verdon family,\r\nits members being Wooton, Stanton, Farley, Ramsor, Coton, Bradley,\r\nSpon, Denston, Stramshall, and Whiston.\r\n\r\nFrom the Verdons, through the Furnivals and Neviles, Alton passed to\r\nthe Earls of Shrewsbury, as will be seen from the following notice\r\nof the Verdon family. Godfreye Compte le Verdon, surnamed de Caplif,\r\nhad a son, Bertram de Verdon, who held Farnham Royal, Bucks, by grand\r\nsergeantry, circa 1080. He had three sons, one of whom, Norman de\r\nVerdon, Lord of Weobly, co. Hereford, married Lasceline, daughter\r\nof Geoffrey de Clinton, and by her had, with other issue, Bertram\r\nde Verdon, who was a Crusader, and founded Croxden, or Crokesden,\r\nAbbey, near Alton, in the twenty-third year of Henry II., anno 1176.\r\nHe married twice: his first wife being Maude, daughter of Robert de\r\nFerrars, first Earl of Derby (who died without issue in 1139), and\r\nhis second being Rohesia, daughter and heiress of a former possessor\r\nof Alton, through which marriage he became possessed of that manor,\r\ncastle, &c. He was Sheriff of the counties of Warwick and Leicester,\r\nand, dying at Joppa, was buried at Acre. By his wife Rohesia (who died\r\nin 1215) he had issue—William; Thomas, who married Eustachia, daughter\r\nof Gilbert Bassett; Bertram; Robert; Walter, who was Constable of\r\nBruges Castle; and Nicholas, through whom the line is continued through\r\nJohn de Verdon, who, marrying Marjorie, one of the co-heiresses of\r\nWalter de Lacie, Lord Palatine of the county of Meath, had issue by\r\nher—Sir Nicholas de Verdon of Ewyas-Lacie Castle; John de Verdon, Lord\r\nof Weobly; Humphrey; Thomas; Agnes; and Theobald, who was Constable\r\nof Ireland, 3rd Edward I., and was in 1306 summoned as Baron Verdon.\r\nHe died at Alton in 1309, and was buried at Croxden Abbey. His son,\r\nTheobald de Verdon, by his first wife, Elizabeth, widow of John de\r\nBurgh, Earl of Ulster, and daughter and one of the co-heiresses of\r\nGilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, by “Joane de Acres,” had a\r\ndaughter, married to Lord Ferrars of Groby; and, by his second wife,\r\nMaude, daughter of Edmund, first Baron Mortimer of Wigmore, had issue,\r\nbesides three sons who died during his lifetime, three daughters, who\r\nbecame his co-heiresses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Alton Towers, from the Terrace._]\r\n\r\nOne of these, Margaret (who married three times), had Weobly Castle\r\nfor her portion; another, Elizabeth, married to Lord de Burghersh,\r\nhad Ewyas-Lacie Castle for her portion; and the other, Joan, had for\r\nher portion Alton, with its castle and dependencies. This lady (Joan\r\nde Verdon) married, firstly, William de Montague; and, secondly,\r\nThomas, second Lord Furnival, who, for marrying her without the king’s\r\nlicence, was fined in the sum of £200. She had by this marriage two\r\nsons, Thomas and William, who were successively third and fourth Barons\r\nFurnival, lords of Hallamshire. This William, Lord Furnival, married\r\nThomasin, daughter and heiress of Nicholas, second Baron Dagworth of\r\nDagworth, and had by her a sole daughter and heiress, Joan de Furnival,\r\nwho, marrying Thomas Neville of Hallamshire, brother to the Earl of\r\nWestmoreland, conveyed to him the title and estates, he being summoned\r\nin 1383 as fifth Baron Furnival. By her he had issue, two daughters\r\nand co-heiresses, the eldest of whom, Maude, “Lady of Hallamshire,”\r\nmarried, in 1408, John Talbot, afterwards first Earl of Shrewsbury\r\nand sixth Baron Talbot of Goderich—“_Le Capitaine Anglais_.” This\r\nnobleman, whose military career was one of the most brilliant recorded\r\nin English history, was summoned as Baron Furnival of Sheffield in\r\n1409; created Earl of Shrewsbury, 1442; and Earl of Waterford, &c.,\r\n1446. He was slain, aged eighty, at Chatillon, in 1453, and was buried\r\nat Whitchurch. This Earl of Shrewsbury, who so conspicuously figures\r\nin Shakespeare’s _Henry VI._, enjoyed, among his other titles, that\r\nof “Lord Verdon of Alton”—a title which continued in the family, the\r\nAlton estates having now for nearly five centuries uninterruptedly\r\nbelonged to them.\r\n\r\nThe titles of this great Earl of Shrewsbury are thus set forth by\r\nShakespeare, when Sir William Lucy, seeking the Dauphin’s tent, to\r\nlearn what prisoners have been taken, and to “survey the bodies of the\r\ndead,” demands—\r\n\r\n  “Where is the great Alcides of the field,\r\n  Valiant Lord Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury?\r\n  Created, for his rare success in arms,\r\n  Great Earl of Washford, Waterford, and Valence\r\n  Lord Talbot of Goodrig and Urchinfield,\r\n  Lord Strange, of Blackmere, _Lord Verdun of Alton_,\r\n  Lord Cromwell of Wingfield, Lord Furnival of Sheffield,\r\n  The thrice victorious Lord of Falconbridge;\r\n  Knight of the noble order of Saint George,\r\n  Worthy Saint Michael, and the Golden Fleece;\r\n  Great Mareshal to Henry the Sixth\r\n  Of all his wars within the realm of France.”\r\n\r\nTo which, it will be remembered, La Pucelle contemptuously replies—\r\n\r\n  “Here is a silly stately style indeed!\r\n  The Turk, that two-and-fifty kingdoms hath—\r\n  Writes not so tedious a style as this—\r\n  Him that thou magnifiest with all these titles,\r\n  Stinking and fly-blown, lies here at our feet.”\r\n\r\nFrom this John, Earl of Shrewsbury,—“the scourge of France,” “so much\r\nfeared abroad that with his name the mothers still their babes,”—the\r\nmanor and estates of Alton and elsewhere passed to his son, John,\r\nsecond earl, who married Elizabeth Butler, daughter of James, Earl of\r\nOrmond, and was succeeded by his son, John, third earl, who married\r\nCatherine Stafford, daughter of Humphrey, Duke of Buckingham; and was\r\nin like manner succeeded by his son, George, fourth earl, K.G., &c.,\r\nwho was only five years of age at his father’s death. He was succeeded,\r\nas fifth earl, by his son, Francis; who, dying in 1560, was succeeded\r\nby his son, George, as sixth earl.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Alton Towers, from the Lake._]\r\n\r\nThis nobleman married, first, Gertrude Manners, daughter of Thomas,\r\nEarl of Rutland; and, second, Elizabeth (generally known as “Bess of\r\nHardwick,” for an account of whom, see the article on Hardwick Hall\r\nin the present volume), daughter of John Hardwick, of Hardwick Hall,\r\nDerbyshire, and successively widow, first, of Robert Barlow, of Barlow;\r\nsecond, of Sir William Cavendish, of Chatsworth; and, third, of Sir\r\nWilliam St. Loe. She was the builder of Chatsworth and of Hardwick\r\nHall. To him was confided the care of Mary Queen of Scots. He was\r\nsucceeded by his son Gilbert, as seventh earl. This young nobleman\r\nwas married before he was fifteen to Mary, daughter of Sir William\r\nCavendish of Chatsworth. He left no surviving male issue, and was\r\nsucceeded by his brother, Edward, as eighth earl, who, having married\r\nJane, daughter of Cuthbert, Lord Ogle, died, without issue, being the\r\nlast of this descent, in 1617. The title then passed to a distant\r\nbranch of the family, in the person of George Talbot, of Grafton;\r\nwho, being descended from Sir Gilbert Talbot, third son of the second\r\nearl, succeeded as ninth earl. From him the title descended in regular\r\nlineal succession to Charles, twelfth earl, who was created by George\r\nI. _Duke_ of Shrewsbury and _Marquis of Alton_, and a K.G. At his\r\ndeath, the dukedom and marquisate expired, and from that time, until\r\n1868, the earldom has never passed directly from a father to a son.\r\nThe thirteenth earl was a Jesuit priest, and he was succeeded by his\r\nnephew as fourteenth earl. Charles, fifteenth earl, dying without\r\nissue, in 1827, was succeeded by his nephew, John (son of John Joseph\r\nTalbot, Esq.), who became sixteenth earl. That nobleman died in\r\n1852, and was succeeded as seventeenth earl, by his cousin, Bertram\r\nArthur Talbot (nephew of Charles, fifteenth earl), who was the only\r\nson of Lieut.-Colonel Charles Thomas Talbot. This young nobleman was\r\nbut twenty years of age when he succeeded to the title and estates,\r\nwhich he enjoyed only four years, dying unmarried at Lisbon, on the\r\n10th of August, 1856. Earl Bertram, who, like the last few earls his\r\npredecessors, was a Roman Catholic, bequeathed the magnificent estates\r\nof Alton Towers to the infant son of the Duke of Norfolk, Lord Edward\r\nHoward, also a Roman Catholic; but Earl Talbot (who was opposed in his\r\nclaim by the Duke of Norfolk, acting for Lord Edward Howard; by the\r\nPrincess Doria Pamphili, of Rome, the only surviving child of Earl\r\nJohn; and by Major Talbot, of Talbot, co. Wexford) claimed the peerage\r\nand estates as rightful heir. After a long-protracted trial, Earl\r\nTalbot’s claim was admitted by the House of Lords, in 1858; and after\r\nanother trial his lordship took formal possession of Alton Towers and\r\nthe other estates of the family, and thus became eighteenth Earl of\r\nShrewsbury, in addition to his title of third Earl of Talbot.\r\n\r\nHis lordship (the Hon. Henry John Chetwynd Talbot, son of Earl Talbot)\r\nwas born in 1803. He served in the Royal Navy, and became an admiral\r\non the reserved list. He was also a Knight of the Order of St. Anne\r\nof Russia, and of St. Louis of France, a Knight of the Bath, and a\r\nPrivy Councillor. In 1830, his lordship, then Mr. Talbot, represented\r\nThetford in Parliament; and in the following year was elected for\r\nArmagh and for Dublin; and from 1837 until 1849, when he entered the\r\nUpper House as Earl Talbot, he represented South Staffordshire. In 1852\r\nhis lordship was made a Lord in Waiting to the Queen; in 1858 Captain\r\nof the Corps of Gentlemen at Arms; and was also Hereditary Lord High\r\nSteward of Ireland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Octagon._]\r\n\r\nHe married in 1828 Lady Sarah Elizabeth Beresford, eldest daughter\r\nof the second Marquis of Waterford, and by her had issue living four\r\nsons, viz.—Charles John, present, nineteenth, Earl of Shrewsbury;\r\nthe Hon. Walter Cecil Talbot, who, in 1869, assumed, by Royal Sign\r\nManual, the surname of Carpenter in lieu of that of Talbot, on his\r\nsucceeding to the Yorkshire estates of the late Countess of Tyrconnell;\r\nthe Hon. Reginald Arthur James Talbot, M.P. for Stafford; and the\r\nHon. Alfred Talbot; and three daughters, viz.: Lady Constance Harriet\r\nMahunesa, married to the Marquis of Lothian; Lady Gertrude Frances;\r\nand Lady Adelaide, married at her father’s death-bed, June 1st, 1868,\r\nto the Earl Brownlow. The eighteenth Earl died in June, 1868, and\r\nwas succeeded by his son, Charles John, Viscount Ingestre, M.P., as\r\nnineteenth earl.\r\n\r\nThe present peer, the noble owner of princely Alton, of Ingestre, and\r\nof other mansions, Charles John Talbot, nineteenth Earl of Shrewsbury,\r\nfourth Earl of Talbot, of Hemsoll, in the county of Glamorgan, Earl of\r\nWaterford, Viscount Ingestre, of Ingestre, in the county of Stafford,\r\nand Baron Talbot, of Hemsoll, in the county of Glamorgan, Hereditary\r\nLord High Steward of Ireland, and Premier Earl in the English and Irish\r\npeerages, was born in 1830, and was educated at Eton and at Merton\r\nCollege, Oxford. In 1859 he became M.P. for North Staffordshire, and,\r\nin 1868, for the borough of Stamford. In 1868 he succeeded his father\r\nin the titles and estates, and entered the Upper House. He formerly\r\nheld a commission in the 1st Life Guards. His lordship married, in\r\n1855, Anne Theresa, daughter of Commander Richard Howe Cockerell, R.N.,\r\nand has issue one son, Charles Henry John, Viscount Ingestre, born in\r\n1860; and three daughters, the Hon. Theresa Susey Helen Talbot, born in\r\n1856; the Hon. Gwendoline Theresa Talbot, born in 1858; and the Hon.\r\nMuriel Frances Louisa Talbot, born in 1859.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Shrewsbury is patron of thirteen livings, eight of\r\nwhich are in Staffordshire, two in Worcestershire, and one each in\r\nOxfordshire, Berkshire, and Shropshire.\r\n\r\nThe arms of the earl are, _gules_, a lion rampant within a bordure\r\nengrailed, _or_. Crest, on a chapeau, _gules_, turned up, _ermine_, a\r\nlion statant, with the tail extended, _or_. Supporters, two talbots,\r\n_argent_.\r\n\r\nWe have thus given a history of this illustrious family from its\r\nfounder to the present day, and proceed to describe its principal seat\r\nin Staffordshire—the beautiful and “stately home” of Alton Towers.\r\n\r\nThe castle of the De Verdons, which was dismantled by the army of the\r\nParliament, stood on the commanding and truly picturesque eminence now\r\noccupied by the unfinished Roman Catholic Hospital of St. John and\r\nother conventual buildings, &c. A remarkably interesting view, showing\r\nthe commanding site of the castle, and the valley of Churnet, with\r\nAlton Church, &c., is fortunately preserved in an original painting\r\nfrom which our first engraving is made.\r\n\r\nThe site of Alton Towers was originally occupied by a plain house,\r\nthe dwelling of a steward of the estate. A hundred and forty years\r\nago it was known as “Alveton (or Alton) Lodge,” and was evidently a\r\ncomfortable homestead, with farm buildings adjoining.\r\n\r\nWhen Charles, fifteenth Earl of Shrewsbury, succeeded to the titles\r\nand estates of his family, in the beginning of the present century,\r\nhe made a tour of his estates, and on visiting Alton was so much\r\npleased with the natural beauties of the place, and its surrounding\r\nneighbourhood, that he determined upon improving the house and laying\r\nout the grounds, so as to make it his summer residence.[1] With that\r\nview he added considerably to the steward’s dwelling, and having, with\r\nthe aid of architects and landscape gardeners, converted that which\r\nwas almost wilderness into a place of beauty, he called it “Alton\r\nAbbey,”—a name to which it had no right or even pretension. To his\r\ntaste, the conservatories, the temples, the pagoda, the stone circle,\r\nthe cascades, the fountains, the terraces, and most of the attractive\r\nfeatures of the grounds, owe their origin, as do many of the rooms of\r\nthe present mansion. A pleasant memory of this excellent nobleman is\r\npreserved at the entrance to the gardens, where, in a noble cenotaph,\r\nis a marble bust, with the literally true inscription—\r\n\r\n  “He made the desert smile.”\r\n\r\nAfter his death, in 1827, his successor, Earl John, continued the\r\nworks at Alton, and, by the noble additions he made to the mansion,\r\nrendered it what it now is—one of the most picturesque of English\r\nseats. In 1832 his lordship consulted Pugin as to some of the\r\nalterations and additions, and this resulted in his designing some new\r\nrooms, and decorating and altering the interior of others. Mr. Fradgley\r\nand other architects had also previously been employed, and to their\r\nskill a great part of the beauty of Alton Towers is attributable. The\r\nparts executed by Pugin are the balustrade at the great entrance,\r\nthe parapet round the south side, the Doria apartments over Lady\r\nShrewsbury’s rooms, on the south-east side of the house, called\r\nsometimes the “plate-glass drawing-room,” the apartments over the\r\nwest end of the great gallery, and the conservatory, &c. The fittings\r\nand decorations of many of the other rooms and galleries, including\r\nthe unfinished dining-hall and the chapel, are also his. The entrance\r\nlodges near the Alton Station are likewise from Pugin’s designs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Conservatories and Alcove._]\r\n\r\nThe principal, or state, entrance to the mansion is on the east side,\r\nbut the private foot entrance from the park is by the drawbridge,\r\nwhile that from the gardens and grounds is by a path leading over the\r\nentrance gateway or tower. To reach the state entrance the visitor\r\non leaving the park, passes a noble gateway in an embattled and\r\nmachicolated tower, with side turrets and embrasures, near to which\r\nhe will notice the sculptured arms of De Verdon, of Furnival, and\r\nof Raby, and on the inner side of the tower, those of Talbot, with\r\nthe date, 1843. Passing between embattled walls, the entrance to the\r\nright is a majestic tower, bearing sculptured over the doorway the\r\narmorial bearings, crest, supporters, with mantling, &c., of the Earl\r\nof Shrewsbury. The steps leading to the doorway are flanked on either\r\nside by a life-size “talbot,” bearing the shield and the family arms,\r\nwhile on the pedestals, &c., are the monogram of Earl John, and the\r\nmotto “Prest d’accomplir.” Passing through the doors the visitor enters\r\nthe ENTRANCE TOWER, a square apartment of extremely lofty proportions.\r\n“The doors being closed after him, he will at once notice the most\r\nstriking feature of this hall to be, that the entrance-doors and the\r\npair of similar folding-doors facing them—each of which is some twenty\r\nfeet high, and of polished oak—are painted on their full size with the\r\narms, supporters, &c., of the Earl of Shrewsbury. This fine effect,\r\nuntil the place was dismantled a few years since, was considerably\r\nheightened by the assemblage of arms, and armour, and of stags’\r\nantlers, &c., with which the walls were decorated. In this apartment\r\nthe old blind Welsh harper, a retainer of the family, with his long\r\ndress, covered with medals and silver badges, sat for years and played\r\nhis native strains on the ancient bardic instrument of his country.\r\n\r\n“From this apartment one of the immense pairs of heraldic doors opens\r\ninto ‘THE ARMOURY,’ a fine Gothic apartment of about 120 feet in\r\nlength, with oak roof, the arches of which spring from carved corbels,\r\nwhile from the central bosses hang a series of pendant lanterns.\r\nThe ‘armoury’ is lit on its north side by a series of stained-glass\r\nwindows, the first of which bears, under a canopy, &c., the portrait\r\nand armorial bearings of William the Conqueror; the next those of\r\n‘Marescallus pater Gilberti Marescalli Regis Henrici Primi, temp.\r\nWill^{m.} Conq^r.;’ the third, those of Donald, King of Scotland,\r\n1093; the fourth, those of Raby; the fifth, those of De Verdun, the\r\nfounder of the castle of Alton (‘Verdun fund: Cast: de Alveton,\r\noriginalis familiæ de Verdun, temp. Will. Conq^r.’); and the sixth, of\r\nLacy—‘Summa soror et heres Hugonis de Lacy, fundatoris de Lanthony in\r\nWallia; Mater Gilberti de Lacy, temp. Will. Conq^r.’ In this apartment,\r\nfrom which a doorway leads to the billiard and other rooms, hang a\r\nnumber of funeral and other banners of the house of Talbot, and at one\r\nend is the Earl’s banner as Lord High Seneschal or Lord High Steward of\r\nIreland—a blue banner bearing the golden harp of ‘Old Ireland’ which\r\nwas borne by the Earl of Shrewsbury at the funeral of King William IV.\r\nIn the palmy days of Alton this apartment was filled with one of the\r\nmost magnificent assemblages of arms and armour ever got together,\r\namongst which not the least noticeable feature was a life-size\r\nequestrian figure of ‘the great Talbot’ in full armour, and bearing on\r\nhis head an antique coronet, in his hand a fac-simile of the famous\r\nsword which he wielded so powerfully while living, bearing the words—\r\n\r\n  ‘Ego sum Talboti pro vincere inimicos meos\r\n\r\nand on his shoulders his magnificent ‘Garter’ mantle, embroidered with\r\nheraldic insignia. The horse was fully armed and caparisoned, the\r\ntrappings bearing the arms and insignia of its noble owner. The figure\r\nwas placed on a raised oak platform, richly carved; and on this, at\r\nthe horse’s feet, lay the fine war helmet of the grand old Earl. At\r\nthe farther or west end of the armoury, a pair of open screen-work\r\ndoors of large size, formed of spears and halberds, and surmounted\r\nby a portcullis—the whole being designed by a former Countess of\r\nShrewsbury—opens into—\r\n\r\n“THE PICTURE-GALLERY.—This noble gallery, about 150 feet in length,\r\nhas a fine oak and glass ceiling, supported by a series of arches,\r\nwhich spring from corbels formed of demi-talbots, holding in their\r\npaws shields with the Talbot arms, while in each spandrel of the roof\r\nare also the same arms. The room is lit with sumptuous chandeliers.\r\nIn this gallery was formerly a series of tables, containing articles\r\nof _vertu_ and a large assemblage of interesting objects, while the\r\nwalls were literally covered with paintings of every school, including\r\nthe collection formed by Letitia Buonaparte, which was purchased in\r\nParis by Earl John. It is now entirely denuded of this treasure of art.\r\nFrom the Picture-Gallery a pair of Gothic screen-work oak and glass\r\nfolding-doors, with side lights to correspond, opens into—\r\n\r\n“THE OCTAGON (sometimes called the ‘Saloon,’ or ‘Sculpture-Gallery’),\r\nan octagonal room designed to some extent from the splendid Chapter\r\nHouse at Wells Cathedral. Like this it has a central pier, or clustered\r\ncolumn, of sixteen shafts, from the foliated capital of which the ribs\r\nof the vaulted roof radiate. Other radiating ribs spring from shafts\r\nat the angles of the room; and where the radiations meet and cross\r\nare sculptured bosses, while a series of geometric cuspings fills in\r\nbetween the intersecting ribs at the points of the arches. Around the\r\nbase of the central column is an octagonal seat, and stone benches\r\nare placed in some parts of the sides. It is lit with pendant Gothic\r\nlanterns.\r\n\r\n“The ‘Octagon’ opens on its east side into the ‘Picture-Gallery;’\r\non its west into the ‘Talbot Gallery;’ and on its north into the\r\n‘Conservatory.’ On its south is a fine large window of Perpendicular\r\ntracery filled with stained glass, while on the other four sides are\r\nsmall windows, diapered in diagonal lines, with the motto, ‘Prest\r\nd’Accomplir,’ alternating with monograms and heraldic devices of\r\nthe family. Over the Picture-Gallery doorway the following curious\r\nverses—a kind of paraphrase of the family motto, ‘Prest d’Accomplir,’\r\nwhich is everywhere inscribed—are painted in old English characters on\r\nan illuminated scroll:—\r\n\r\n  “‘The redie minde regardeth never toyle,\r\n  But still is Prest t’accomplish heartes intent;\r\n  Abrode, at home, in every coste or soyle.\r\n  The dede is done, that inwardly is meante;\r\n  Which makes me saye to every vertuous dede,\r\n  I am still Prest t’accomplish what’s decreede.\r\n\r\n  “‘But byd to goe I redie am to roune,\r\n  But byd to roune I redie am to ride;\r\n  To goe, roune, ride, or what else to bee done.\r\n  Speke but the word, and sone it shall be tryde;\r\n  Tout prest je suis pour accomplix la chose,\r\n  Par tout labeur qui vous peut faire repose.\r\n\r\n  “‘Prest to accomplish what you shall commande,\r\n  Prest to accomplish what you shall desyre,\r\n  Prest to accomplish your desires demande,\r\n  Prest to accomplish heaven for happy hire;\r\n  Thus do I ende, and at your will I reste,\r\n  As you shall please, in every action Prest.’\r\n\r\n“Above this, and other parts of the walls, are the emblazoned arms of\r\nTalbot, Furnivall, De Verdun, Lacy, Raby, and the other alliances of\r\nthe family; while in the large stained-glass window on the south side\r\nare splendid full-length figures of six archbishops and bishops of the\r\nTalbot family, with their arms and those of the sees over which they\r\npresided. Beneath this window are two beautiful models, full size, of\r\nancient tombs of the great Talbots of former days. One of these is the\r\nfamous tomb, from Whitchurch, of John, first Earl of Shrewsbury, who\r\nwas killed in battle July 7, 1453. It bears a full-length effigy of the\r\nEarl in his Garter robes and armour, and bears on its sides and ends a\r\nnumber of emblazoned shields of the Talbot alliances, and the following\r\ninscription:—\r\n\r\n “‘_Orate pro anima prœnobilis domini, domini Johanis Talbot, Comitis\r\n Salopiæ, domini Furnival, domini Verdun, domini Strange de Blackmere,\r\n et Mareschalli Franciæ; qui obiit, in bello apud Burdeux_ VII _Julii_\r\n MCCCCLIII.’\r\n\r\n“It is related that when this noble warrior was slain, his herald\r\npassing over the battle-field to seek the body, at length found it\r\nbleeding and lifeless, when he kissed it, and broke out into these\r\npassionate and dutiful expressions:—‘Alas! it is you: I pray God\r\npardon all your misdoings. I have been your officer of arms forty years\r\nor more. It is time I should surrender it to you.’ And while the tears\r\ntrickled plentifully down his cheek, he disrobed himself of his coat of\r\narms and flung it over his master’s body. This is the knight of whom we\r\nread—\r\n\r\n  “‘Which Sir John Talbote, first Lord Fournivall,\r\n    Was most worthie warrior we read of all.\r\n  For by his knigh thode and his chivalrye\r\n    A Knight of the Garter first he was made;\r\n  And of King Henry, first Erle Scrovesberye.\r\n    To which Sir John, his sone succession hade,\r\n    And his noble successors now therto sade;\r\n  God give them goode speede in their progresse,\r\n  And Heaven at their ende, both more or lesse.\r\n  The live to report of this foresaid lorde\r\n    How manly hee was, and full chivalrose:\r\n  What deedes that he did I cannot by worde\r\n    Make rehersal, by meter ne prose;\r\n    How manly, how true, and how famose,\r\n  In Ireland, France, Normandy, Lyon, and Gascone\r\n  His pere so long renyng I rede of none.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Which while he reigned was most knight\r\n    That was in the realme here many yere,\r\n  Most dughty of hand and feresest in fight,\r\n    Most drede of all other with French men of werr\r\n  In Ireland, France, Gyon; whose soule God absolve\r\n  And bring to that Llyss that will not dissolve.’\r\n\r\n“From the north side of the ‘Octagon’ a flight of stone steps leads\r\nup to a glass doorway, which opens into a glass vestibule, forming a\r\npart of the ‘Conservatory,’ of which I shall speak a little later on.\r\nThis conservatory leads into the ‘Dining-room’ and the suite on the\r\nnorth side, and the view along it from the Octagon is charming in the\r\nextreme, not the least striking and sweetly appropriate matter being\r\nthe motto painted above the flowers and around the cornice of the\r\nvestibule:—\r\n\r\n  “‘The speech of flowers exceeds all flowers of speech.’\r\n\r\n“On the west side a similar flight of steps and doorway open into\r\n\r\n“THE TALBOT GALLERY, a magnificent apartment of about the same size\r\nand proportions as the ‘Picture-Gallery.’ It has a fine Gothic ceiling\r\nof oak and glass, supported, like that of the Picture-Gallery, on\r\narches springing from demi-talbots bearing shields. The walls, to about\r\ntwo-thirds of their height, are covered with a rich arabesque paper of\r\nexcellent design, while the upper part is painted throughout its entire\r\nsurface in diagonal lines with the Talbot motto ‘Prest d’Accomplir,’\r\nalternating with the initials T. (Talbot) and S. (Shrewsbury). On this\r\ndiapered groundwork are painted, at regular intervals, shields of arms,\r\nfully blazoned, with tablets beneath them containing the names of their\r\nillustrious bearers. The series of arms on the south side shows the\r\ndescent of the Earl of Shrewsbury from the time of the Conquest, while\r\nthose on the north side exhibit the armorial bearings of the alliances\r\nformed by the females of the House of Talbot. As these series are of\r\ngreat importance, and have only heretofore been given in Mr. Jewitt’s\r\nwork upon Alton Towers, from which the whole of the description of the\r\ninterior here given is copied, I have carefully noted them for the\r\nreader’s information. On the south side, commencing at the end next the\r\n‘Octagon,’ the arms are as follows, the arms being all impaled:—\r\n\r\n  “William the Conqueror and Matilda of Flanders.\r\n  King Henry I. and Matilda of Scotland.\r\n  Geoffrey Plantagenet, Earl of Anjou, and Matilda, daughter of King\r\n      Henry I.\r\n  King Henry II. and Eleanor of Aquitaine.\r\n  King John and Isabella d’Angoulême.\r\n  King Henry III. and Eleanor of Provence.\r\n  King Edward I. and Eleanor of Castile.\r\n  Humphrey Bohun, Earl of Hereford, and Elizabeth, daughter of King\r\n      Edward I.\r\n  James Butler, Earl of Ormond, and Eleanor, daughter of the Earl of\r\n      Hereford.\r\n  James, Earl of Ormond, and Elizabeth, daughter of the Earl of Kildare.\r\n  James, Earl of Ormond, and Anne, daughter of Baron Welles.\r\n  James, Earl of Ormond, and Joane, daughter of William de Beauchamp.\r\n  John Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury, and Elizabeth, daughter of the Earl\r\n      of Ormond.\r\n  Sir Gilbert Talbot, Knight of the Garter, and Audrey Cotton.\r\n  Sir John Talbot and Ada Troutbecke.\r\n  Sir John Talbot and Frances Clifford.\r\n  John Talbot and Catherine Petre.\r\n  John Talbot and Eleanor Baskerville.\r\n  John, Earl of Shrewsbury, and Mary Fortescue.\r\n  Gilbert Talbot and June Flatsbury.\r\n  George, Earl of Shrewsbury, and Mary Fitzwilliam.\r\n  Charles Talbot and Mary Mostyn.\r\n  John Joseph Talbot and Mary Clifton.\r\n  ‘John, now Earl of Shrewsbury, Waterford, and Wexford,’ and Maria\r\n      Talbot.\r\n  Richard, Baron Talbot, ancestor of the Earl of Shrewsbury, and\r\n      Elizabeth Cummin.\r\n  John, father of Elizabeth Cummin, and Joane de Valence.\r\n  William de Valletort, Earl of Pembroke, and Joane Mountchesney.\r\n  Hugh, Count de la Marche, and Isabel d’Angoulême.\r\n  Aymer, Count d’Angoulême, and Alice de Courteney.\r\n  Peter, fils de France, and the Heiress of Courteney.\r\n  Louis VI., King of Fiance, father of Peter de Courteney.\r\n  Richard Talbot and Eva, daughter of Gerrard de Gournay.\r\n  Hugh Talbot and Beatrix, daughter of William de Mandeville.\r\n  Richard Talbot and Maud, daughter of Stephen Bulmer.\r\n  Richard Talbot and Aliva, daughter of Alan Bassett.\r\n  William Talbot and Gwendiline, daughter of Rhys ap Griffith, Prince of\r\n      Wales.\r\n  Richard Baron Talbot and Elizabeth Cummin.\r\n  John Cummin, grandfather of Elizabeth, and Margery Baliol.\r\n  John Baliol and Dorvegillia, Lady of Galloway.\r\n  David the First, King of Scotland, and the Lady of Galloway.\r\n\r\n“On the north side, beginning at the west end, the arms of the female\r\nalliances are as on the other side—impaled—and are as follows:—\r\n\r\n  “Joane Talbot, married to John Carew.\r\n  Joane Talbot to John de Dartmouth.\r\n  Elizabeth Talbot to Waren Archdekene.\r\n  Katherine Talbot to Sir Roger Chandos.\r\n  Phillippa Talbot to Sir Matthew Gournay.\r\n  Jane Talbot to Sir Nicholas Poynings.\r\n  Anne Talbot to Hugh, Earl of Devon.\r\n  Mary Talbot to Sir Thomas Greene.\r\n  Elizabeth Talbot to Sir Thomas Barre.\r\n  Jane Talbot to Hugh de Cokesay.\r\n  Elizabeth Talbot to Thomas Gray, Viscount Lisle.\r\n  Margaret Talbot to Sir George Vere.\r\n  Anne Talbot to Sir Henry Vernon.\r\n  Margaret Talbot to Thomas Chaworth.\r\n  Eleanor Talbot to Thomas, Baron Sudeley.\r\n  Margaret Talbot to Henry, Earl of Cumberland.\r\n  Mary Talbot to Henry, Earl of Northumberland.\r\n  Elizabeth Talbot to Lord Dacre of Gilsland.\r\n  Anne Talbot to Peter Compton.\r\n  Anne Talbot to William, Earl of Pembroke.\r\n  Anne Talbot to John, Baron Bray.\r\n  Anne Talbot to Thomas, Lord Wharton.\r\n  Catherine Talbot to Edward, Earl of Pembroke.\r\n  Mary Talbot to Sir George Saville.\r\n  Grace Talbot to Henry Cavendish.\r\n  Mary Talbot to William, Earl of Pembroke.\r\n  Elizabeth Talbot to Henry, Earl of Kent.\r\n  Alatheia Talbot to Thomas, Earl of Arundel.\r\n  Gertrude Talbot to Robert, Earl of Kingston.\r\n  Mary Talbot to Thomas Holcroft.\r\n  Mary Talbot to Sir William Airmine.\r\n  Margaret Talbot to Robert Dewport.\r\n  Elizabeth Talbot to Sir John Littleton.\r\n  Mary Talbot to Thomas Astley.\r\n  Joane Talbot to Sir George Bowes.\r\n  Mary Talbot to Mervin, Earl of Castlehaven.\r\n  Barbara Talbot to James, Lord Aston.\r\n  Mary Talbot to Charles, Baron Dormer.\r\n  Mary Alathea Beatrix Talbot to Prince Filippo Doria Pamfili.\r\n  Gwendaline Catherine Talbot to Prince Marc Antonio Borghese.\r\n\r\n“On and over the doorway are the arms and quarterings of the Talbots,\r\nand the sculptured stone chimney-pieces are of the most exquisite\r\ncharacter, having Talbots supporting enamelled banners of arms under\r\nGothic canopies, and shields on the cuspings. At the top also is a\r\nshield, supported by two angels. The fire-place is open, and has\r\nfire-dogs; and the tiles are decorated alternately with the letter S\r\nfor Shrewsbury, and I T conjoined, for John Talbot.\r\n\r\n“At the west end is a splendid stained-glass window, exhibiting the\r\nnames, armorial bearings, and dates of Earl John and nine of his\r\nancestors, who have been Knights of the Garter—the garter encircling\r\neach of the shields. The names are Gilbert, Lord Talbot, 19 Henry VI.;\r\nJohn, Earl of Shrewsbury, 1460; George, 4th Earl of Shrewsbury; George\r\nTalbot; Francis, 5th Earl of Shrewsbury; Sir Gilbert Talbot, 1495;\r\nGeorge, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury; Gilbert, 7th Earl of Shrewsbury, 1592;\r\nCharles, Earl of Shrewsbury, 1604; and John, Earl of Shrewsbury, 1840.\r\n\r\n“In the palmy days of Alton Towers, this room, the Talbot Gallery,\r\ncontained a splendid collection of choice paintings, a fine assemblage\r\nof rare china, some exquisite sculpture, and a large number of articles\r\nof _vertu_ of every imaginable class and character. From the north side\r\na small door opens into—\r\n\r\n“THE OAK CORRIDOR, a narrow passage leading in a straight line to the\r\nNorth Library, and having doorways opening on its left into both of the\r\nstate-rooms. The first of these rooms, after passing the ‘waiting-room’\r\nor ‘ante-room,’ is—\r\n\r\n“THE STATE BOUDOIR, an octagonal apartment with a magnificent carved,\r\npainted, and gilt Gothic ceiling. This, in former days, when it\r\ncontained some fine old cabinets, a service of regal Sèvres china, and\r\nsome exquisite portraits, and was filled with sumptuous furniture, was\r\none of the most charming rooms imaginable. Next to this is—\r\n\r\n“THE STATE BED-ROOM.—The ceiling is panelled, being divided by deep\r\nribs into squares, having the ground painted a pale blue; rich tracery\r\nof oak and gold stretches toward the centre of each compartment, and\r\nterminates with a gold leaf; the hollow mouldings of the ribs are\r\ncrimson, studded with gold; below is a deep cornice of vine-leaves and\r\nfruit picked out green and gold; and the walls are hung with paper of\r\nan azure ground, relieved with crimson and gold.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Temple._]\r\n\r\n“The State Bed, which is about 18 feet in height and 9 feet in width,\r\nis a sumptuous piece of massive Gothic furniture, all gilt in every\r\npart and massively carved. Around the canopy hangs the most costly\r\nof bullion fringe, and the hangings, as well as those of the windows\r\nand other furniture, are of the richest possible golden Indian silk.\r\nThis room formerly contained a toilet service of gold, and the whole\r\nof the furniture and decorations were of the grandest character. The\r\nchimney-piece is of white marble, exquisitely carved, and bearing\r\non the spandrels the Talbot arms—a lion rampant within a bordure\r\nengrailed. The furniture is all gilt like the bed, with which also the\r\ndrapery is _en suite_. The windows, as do also those of the boudoir,\r\nlook out upon a perfect sea of magnificent rhododendrons. One door\r\nopens into the Oak Corridor, and another into—\r\n\r\n“THE DINING-ROOM, from which, by a doorway, the Oak Corridor is also\r\nentered, and from which, by a light staircase, access to the upper\r\nsuite of sleeping apartments, including the ‘Arragon room’ (and to the\r\nlower rooms) is gained. From this ante-room—\r\n\r\n“THE WEST LIBRARY is entered. This apartment, a fine, sombre,\r\nquiet-looking room, has a panelled ceiling, at the intersections of\r\nthe ribs of which are carved heraldic bosses. In the centre is a large\r\nand massive dark oak table, and around the sides of the room are\r\nranged fine old carved and inlaid cabinets and presses for books. Over\r\nthese presses, and in different parts of this room and of the ‘North\r\nLibrary,’ are a number of well-chosen mottoes, than which for a library\r\nnothing could well be more appropriate. Thus, in these mottoes, among\r\nothers we read—\r\n\r\n  “‘Study wisdom and make thy heart joyful.’\r\n  “‘The wise shall inherit glory, but shame shall be the portion of\r\n        fools.’\r\n  “‘They that be wise shall shine as the firmament.’\r\n  “‘Blessed is the man that findeth wisdom, and is rich in prudence.’\r\n  “‘The heart of the wise shall instruct his mouth and add grace to his\r\n        lips.’\r\n  “‘Take hold on instruction; leave it not; keep it because it is thy\r\n        life.’\r\n  “‘Knowledge is a fountain of life to him that possesseth it.’\r\n\r\n“From this fine apartment the NORTH LIBRARY is entered by two open\r\narchways. This room is similar in its appointments to the West Library,\r\nand with it forms one magnificent whole. At the north-west corner of\r\nthis room (in the tower) is a charming apartment, connected with the\r\nlibrary by an open archway, called—\r\n\r\n“THE POET’S BAY or ‘Poet’s Corner,’ which is one of the most charming\r\nof all imaginable retreats. The bay window overlooks the park and the\r\ndistant country for miles away, while the side windows overlook parts\r\nof the grounds and buildings. The ceiling is of the most elaborate\r\ncharacter, covered with minute tracery and exquisite pendents\r\npicked out in gold and colours. At the west end of the library is a\r\nstained-glass window with full-length figures of ‘Gilbert Talbot’ and\r\nthe ‘Lady Joan,’ with their arms under Gothic canopies. From this room\r\na door on the south side opens into the ‘Oak Corridor,’ while two open\r\narches at the east end connect it with—\r\n\r\n“THE MUSIC-ROOM, the ceiling of which is an elegant example of\r\nflamboyant tracery, the ground being blue, and the raised tracery\r\nwhite and gold. The chimney-piece of white marble is elaborately\r\nsculptured, and from it rises a majestic pier-glass. On either side are\r\nportraits of Earl John and his Countess, life-size, surmounted by their\r\ncoronets. The furniture which remains is of remarkably fine character,\r\ncarved and gilt, and the walls are here and there filled in with\r\nmirrors, which add much to the effect. On the south side is a large\r\nand deeply-recessed bay window, like the rest, of Gothic design, with\r\nstained glass in its upper portion, representing King David playing on\r\nthe harp, St. Cecilia, and angels with various musical instruments.\r\nIn front of this window is a beautiful parterre of flowers, the\r\nConservatory being to the left, and the state-rooms to the right. From\r\nthe ‘Music-Room,’ glass doors, in a Gothic screen, open into a small\r\nlibrary, with Gothic presses and stained-glass window with Talbot arms,\r\n&c. From this room another similar door opens into—\r\n\r\n“THE DRAWING-ROOM, a remarkably fine and strikingly grand Gothic\r\napartment, with a ceiling of flamboyant tracery of very similar design\r\nto the one already named. To the right, on entering, a central door of\r\nGothic screen-work and glass opens into the CONSERVATORY, which, as I\r\nhave before said, connects this room and those on the north side with\r\nthe Octagon and those on the south side. The CONSERVATORY is entirely\r\nof glass, both roof and sides, and has a central transept. It is filled\r\nwith the choicest plants, and in every part, except the vestibule,\r\nthe sweetly pretty and appropriate text, ‘Consider the lilies of the\r\nfield how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin, yet I say\r\nunto you, that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like unto\r\none of these,’ is painted around the cornice. In the vestibule, as I\r\nhave said, the motto is, ‘The speech of flowers exceeds all flowers of\r\nspeech.’ Over the Conservatory door, in stained glass, are the arms of\r\nTalbot, Verdun, &c.; the crowned rose and thistle; and other devices.\r\nOpposite to the Conservatory, on the north side, is the ‘Saloon.’\r\nThe furniture of the ‘Drawing-room,’ the chairs, couches, and seats,\r\nare all of the most costly character, some of them draped with the\r\narms, supporters, &c., of the earl in gold and crimson damask. On a\r\ntable in this room are arranged the various addresses, in cabinets,\r\n&c., presented to the late Earl of Shrewsbury on his accession to the\r\nearldom and estates after the trial in 1860, and a magnificent ancient\r\ncasket, the outer glass case of which bears the inscription—‘La casset\r\nTalbot presente par Jean, premier Comte de Shreusburie, sur son mariage\r\na Marguerite Beauclerc.’ On the walls, besides other paintings, is\r\na fine full-length seated figure of Queen Adelaide. The ends of the\r\nroom are Gothic screen-work, with doors and mirrors. One of these, at\r\nthe east end, leads into another small library, and so on by a small\r\ngallery, denuded of its objects of interest, to the CHAPEL CORRIDOR\r\n(elaborately groined and panelled in oak), from which the private\r\napartments are gained, and which also leads direct to—\r\n\r\n“THE CHAPEL, which, although ruthlessly shorn of its relics, its\r\npaintings, its altar, its shrines, and all its more interesting\r\nobjects, is still one of the most gorgeous and beautiful of rooms. It\r\nis enough to say that it is one of Pugin’s masterpieces, and that the\r\nstained glass is perhaps the finest that even Willement, by whom it was\r\nexecuted, ever produced. It is impossible to conceive anything finer\r\nthan was the effect of this chapel when it was in perfect order.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Conservatories._]\r\n\r\n“With the drawing-room, as I have said, an open archway connects\r\nanother magnificent apartment, the SALOON, which has a fine oak-groined\r\nceiling, with elegantly carved, gilt, and painted bosses. In the centre\r\nof the west side is a fine stained-glass window, representing Edward,\r\nthe Black Prince, full length, in armour, and with his garter robes,\r\npainted by Muss; and opposite to this a doorway opens into a corridor\r\nleading to the drawing and other rooms. The view from the north end\r\nof the saloon, looking down its full length, across the splendid\r\ndrawing-room, down the long vista of the conservatory, and into the\r\noctagon at the farthest end, is fine in the extreme, and is indeed\r\nmatchless.\r\n\r\n“THE CORRIDOR, of which I have just spoken, is one of the most dainty\r\nand minutely beautiful ‘bits’ of the whole building. It is of oak, the\r\nsides are panelled and gilt, and from small clustered pilasters rises\r\nthe elaborate oak groining of the ceiling, the groining being what can\r\nonly be expressed as ‘skeleton groining,’ the ribs alone being of oak,\r\npartly painted and gilt, and the space between them being filled in\r\nwith a minute geometric pattern in stained glass. From this corridor a\r\ndoor in the north side opens into the—\r\n\r\n“SMALL or FAMILY DINING-ROOM, a fine sombre-looking apartment, about\r\n25 feet square, and furnished with a magnificent central table, and\r\nevery accompaniment that wealth can desire. The ceiling is of oak,\r\npanelled, and has a rich armorial cornice, with arms of Talbot, running\r\naround it. The chimney-piece, of dark oak, is a splendid piece of\r\nancient carving. From the corridor another doorway leads to a staircase\r\nconnecting other private apartments above, while at its east end it\r\nopens into—\r\n\r\n“THE GRAND DINING-HALL, near which are the kitchens. This hall, which\r\nwas being remodelled and altered by Pugin at the time of the Earl’s\r\ndeath, remains to this day in an unfinished state, but shows how\r\ntruly grand in every way it would have been had it been completed.\r\nThe roof is one of the finest imaginable, and from its centre rises\r\na majestic louvre, which at once admits a subdued light and acts as\r\na ventilator. It is of truly noble proportions, and the fire-places\r\nand carved stone chimney-pieces are grand in the extreme—the latter\r\nbearing the arms, crest, supporters, motto, chapeau, &c., of the Earl\r\nof Shrewsbury. The sides of the room were intended to be panelled, as\r\nwas also the minstrels’ gallery, with carved oak, and a part of this\r\nis already placed. At the north end is a fine large window, the upper\r\npart of which is filled with armorial bearings, but the lower part\r\nhas never been completed, and is filled in with plain quarries. The\r\narms in this window are those of Talbot Earl of Shrewsbury, Clifford,\r\nBeauchamp, De Valence, Comyn, Mountchesny, Nevile, Middleham, Clifford,\r\nBohun, Strange of Blackmere, Tailebot, Troutbeke, Claveringe, Buckley,\r\nPembroke, Borghese, Doria, Lovetoft, Mareschal, Strongbow, King Donald,\r\nRaby, Lacy, De Verdun, Castile and Leon, D’Angoulême, William the\r\nConqueror, Bagot, Mexley, Aylmer, and others.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Pagoda._]\r\n\r\n“From here a short corridor leads to a small vestibule, from which\r\nthe other private apartments extend. Of these the principal one is the\r\nBOUDOIR of the Countess of Shrewsbury—a charming apartment, replete\r\nwith every luxury and with every appliance which taste and art can\r\ndictate. The ‘Doria’ and other apartments are reached from near this by\r\na circular staircase. From the vestibule the private entrance to the\r\nTowers is gained, and from it is the private way across the entrance\r\ngateway into the grounds; and also through the small tower and across\r\nthe drawbridge the park is reached. The drawbridge crosses the moat,\r\nand the entrance is fully guarded, and has all the appliances of an old\r\nbaronial castle.”[2]\r\n\r\nAnd now let us speak briefly of the situation of Alton Towers, and\r\nof its grounds of matchless charms. Situate almost in the centre of\r\nEngland—in busy Staffordshire, but on the borders of picturesque\r\nDerbyshire—Alton Towers is within easy reach of several populous\r\ncities and towns, the active and laborious denizens of which frequently\r\n“breathe” in these always open gardens and grounds the pure and\r\nfragrant air.\r\n\r\nThe roads to it are, moreover, full of interest and surpassing beauty;\r\napproached from any side, the traveller passes through a country rich\r\nin the picturesque. Those who reach it from thronged and toiling\r\nManchester, from active and energetic Derby, from the potteries of busy\r\nStaffordshire, are regaled by Nature on their way, and are refreshed\r\nbefore they drink from the full cup of loveliness with which the\r\nmansion and its grounds and gardens supply them.\r\n\r\nThe route from Derby passes by way of Egginton; Tutbury, whose grand\r\nold church and extensive ruins of the castle are seen to the left of\r\nthe line; Sudbury, where the seat of Lord Vernon (Sudbury Hall) will be\r\nnoticed to the right; Marchington, Scropton, and Uttoxeter. Here, at\r\nUttoxeter Junction, the passenger for Alton Towers will alight, and,\r\nentering another carriage, proceed on his way, passing the town of\r\nUttoxeter on his left, and Doveridge Hall, the seat of Lord Waterpark,\r\non his right, by way of Rocester (where the branch line for Ashbourne\r\nand Dove-Dale joins in), to the Alton Station. Arrived here, he will\r\nnotice, a short distance to the left, high up on a wooded cliff, the\r\nunfinished Roman Catholic Hospital of St. John, and on the right, close\r\nto the station, the entrance lodge to the Towers.\r\n\r\nFrom Manchester the visitor proceeds by way of Stockport and\r\nMacclesfield to the North Rode Junction, and so on by Leek and\r\nOakamoor, &c., through the beautiful scenery of the Churnet valley, to\r\nAlton Station, as before.\r\n\r\nFrom the Staffordshire Potteries the visitor, after leaving\r\nStoke-upon-Trent, will pass through Longton, another of the pottery\r\ntowns, Blythe Bridge, Cresswell, and Leigh, to Uttoxeter, whence he\r\nwill proceed in the same manner as if travelling from Derby.\r\n\r\nThere are, besides others of less note, two principal entrances to the\r\npark and grounds of Alton Towers. One of these, the “Quicksall” Lodge,\r\nis on the Uttoxeter Road, about a quarter of a mile from Ellastone. By\r\nthis the “Earl’s Drive” is entered, and it is, for length and beauty,\r\nthe most charming of the roads to the house. The drive is about three\r\nmiles in length from the lodge to the house, and passes through some\r\ntruly charming scenery along the vale and on the heights of the Churnet\r\nvalley—the river Churnet being visible at intervals through the first\r\npart of its route. Within about half a mile of the house, on the right,\r\nwill be seen the conservatory, ornamented with statues, busts, and\r\nvases, and on the left a lake of water. A little farther on is the\r\nGothic temple, close to the road-side. At this point Alton Towers and\r\nthe intervening gardens burst upon the eye in all their magnificence\r\nand beauty. It is a peep into a terrestrial paradise. Proceeding\r\nonwards another quarter of a mile through a plantation of pines, the\r\nnoble mansion stands before us in all the fulness of its splendour.\r\nThe lake, the lawn, the arcade bridge, the embattled terrace, the\r\ntowers, and the surrounding foliage come broadly and instantaneously\r\nupon the view—a splendid and imposing picture—a place to be gazed on\r\nand wondered at. By this drive the Towers are reached by way of the\r\ncastellated stable-screen, and so on over the bridge and the entrance\r\nto the gardens.\r\n\r\nThe other, and usual, lodge, is close by the Alton Station on the\r\nChurnet Valley (North Staffordshire) Railway. This lodge, designed by\r\nPugin, and decorated with the sculptured arms of the family, is about\r\na mile from the house, and the carriage-drive up the wood is on the\r\nascent all the way. A path, called “the steps,” for foot passengers,\r\nturns off from the lodge, and winds and “zig-zags” its way up, arriving\r\nat the house opposite to the Clock Tower, and passing on its way some\r\ncharming bits of rocky and wooded scenery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Choragic Temple._]\r\n\r\nThe gardens are entered from the park by a pair of gates (on either\r\nside of which is a superb cedar) in an archway, under the “Earl’s\r\nDrive” Bridge. Near this spot is the CHORAGIC TEMPLE, designed from\r\nthe Choragic monument of Lysicrates, at Athens; it contains a bust\r\nof Earl Charles, the founder of the gardens, with the appropriate\r\ninscription—“He made the desert smile.” From here the visitor then\r\nproceeds along a winding path with an arcaded wall on one side, and the\r\nvalley, from which come up the music of the stream and the bubbling\r\nof the miniature fountains, on the other. This passes between myriads\r\nof standard roses on either side, and long continuous beds of “ribbon\r\ngardening,” or what, from its splendid array of continuous lines of\r\ncolours, may very appropriately be termed “rainbow gardening,” and\r\npathways winding about in every direction, among roses, hollyhocks, and\r\nshrubs and flowers of divers kinds, to a pleasant spot to the left,\r\nwhere is a terrace garden approached by steps with pedestals bearing\r\nchoice sculptures. In the centre is a sundial; behind this, a fine\r\ngroup of sculpture, and behind this again a fountain, surmounted by a\r\nlion. The wall is covered with luxuriant ivy, and headed by innumerable\r\nvases of gay-coloured flowers, above which, a little to the back, rises\r\none of the many conservatories that are scattered over this portion of\r\nthe grounds.\r\n\r\nPassing onwards, the visitor soon afterwards reaches the GRAND\r\nCONSERVATORIES—a splendid pile of buildings on his left. These\r\nconservatories are three hundred feet in length, and consist of a\r\ncentral house for palm-trees, and other plants of a similar nature; two\r\nglass-roofed open corridors filled with hardy plants, and decorated\r\nwith gigantic vases filled with flowers; and, at one end, a fine\r\norangery, and at the other end a similar house filled with different\r\nchoice plants and trees. In front of the Grand Conservatory the\r\ngrounds are terraced to the bottom of the valley, and immediately\r\nopposite, on the distant heights, is the “Harper’s Cottage.” At the\r\nend of the broad terrace-walk, in front of the conservatory, is THE\r\nTEMPLE—a semi-open temple, or alcove, of circular form, fitted with\r\nseats and central table. From this charming spot, which the visitor\r\nwill find too tempting to pass by without a rest, a magnificent view\r\nof the grounds is obtained. Immediately beneath are the terraces,\r\nwith their parterres, ponds, arcades, and fountains, receding gently\r\nfrom the view till they are lost in the deep valley, beyond which\r\nrise the wooded heights, terrace on terrace, on the other side, and\r\nterminated with tall trees and the buildings of the tower. From the\r\ntemple a broad pathway leads on to the GOTHIC TEMPLE, and so to the\r\nmodern STONEHENGE—an imitation Druidical circle—and other interesting\r\nobjects. Retracing his path, the visitor will do well to descend by the\r\nsteps to a lower terrace, where he will find an open alcove beneath the\r\ntemple. From here many paths diverge amid beds of the choicest flowers\r\nlaid out with the most exquisite taste, and of every variety of form,\r\nand studded in all directions with vases and statuary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Alton Towers, from the Lower Terrace._]\r\n\r\nDescending a flight of steps beneath a canopy of ivy, a rosery, arched\r\nbehind an open arcade of stone, is reached. This arcade is decorated\r\nwith gigantic vases and pedestals, and from here, arcade after arcade,\r\nterrace after terrace, and flight of steps after flight of steps, lead\r\ndown to the bottom of the valley, where the “lower lake,” filled with\r\nwater-lilies and other aquatic plants, is found. In this lake stands\r\nthe PAGODA, or CHINESE TEMPLE. Before reaching this, about halfway\r\ndown the hill-side, will be seen the “upper lake,” a charming sheet of\r\nwater, filled with water-lilies and other plants, and containing, among\r\nits other beauties, a number of fish and water-fowl. Over this lake\r\nis a prettily designed foot-bridge forming a part of what is called\r\n“Jacob’s Ladder”—a sloping pathway with innumerable turnings, and\r\ntwinings, and flights of steps. Arrived at the PAGODA FOUNTAIN, the\r\nvisitor will choose between returning by the same route, or crossing\r\nor going round the lake, and pursuing his way up the opposite side,\r\nby winding and zig-zag pathways and small plateau, to the top of the\r\nheights.\r\n\r\nThe ornamental grounds are, as will have been gathered from this\r\ndescription, a deep valley or ravine, which, made lovely in the highest\r\nand wildest degree by nature, has been converted by man into a kind of\r\nearthly paradise. The house stands at one end or edge of this ravine,\r\nand commands a full view of the beauties with which it is studded.\r\nThese garden grounds, although only some fifty or sixty acres in\r\nextent, are, by their very character, and by their innumerable winding\r\npathways, and their diversified scenery, made to appear of at least\r\ntwice that extent. Both sides of the ravine or gorge, are formed into\r\na series of terraces, each of which is famed for some special charm of\r\nnatural or artificial scenery it contains or commands; while temples,\r\ngrottoes, fountains, rockeries, statues, vases, conservatories,\r\nrefuges, alcoves, steps, and a thousand-and-one other beauties, seem\r\nto spring up everywhere and add their attractions to the general\r\nscene. Without wearying the visitor by taking him along these devious\r\npaths—which he will follow at will—a word or two on some of the main\r\nfeatures of the gardens, besides those of which we have already spoken,\r\nwill suffice. Some of these are:—\r\n\r\nThe HARPER’S COTTAGE, in which the Welsh harper—a fine old remnant\r\nof the bardic race of his country, and an esteemed retainer of the\r\nfamily—resided, is near the summit of the heights opposite to the\r\n“Grand Conservatories.” It is in the Swiss style, and commands one of\r\nthe most gorgeous views of the grounds and their surroundings. It was\r\nbuilt from the designs of Mr. Fradgley, who was employed during no less\r\nthan twenty-two years on works at Alton Towers.\r\n\r\nThe CORKSCREW FOUNTAIN, standing in the midst of a pool filled with\r\naquatic plants, is a column of unequal thickness of five tiers, each\r\nof which is fluted up its surface in a spiral direction, giving it a\r\ncurious and pleasing effect.\r\n\r\nThe GOTHIC TEMPLE, at the summit of the heights, on the opposite side\r\nfrom the “Harper’s Cottage,” and closely adjoining the “Earl’s Drive,”\r\nis a light and picturesque building of four stories in height, with a\r\nspiral staircase leading to the top. From it a magnificent view of the\r\ngrounds, the towers, and the surrounding country, is obtained.\r\n\r\nThe REFUGE is a pretty little retreat—a recessed alcove with inner\r\nroom in fact—which the visitor, if weary with “sight-seeing,” or, for\r\na time, satiated with beauty, will find pleasant for a rest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Gothic Temple._]\r\n\r\nThe PAGODA FOUNTAIN is built in form of a Chinese pagoda. It is placed\r\nin the lower lake, and from its top rises a majestic jet of water which\r\nfalls down into the lake and adds much to the beauty of the place.\r\n\r\nSTONEHENGE.—This is an imitation “Druidic Circle” formed of stones,\r\nof about nine tons in weight each; it is highly picturesque, and forms\r\na pleasing feature. Near to it is the upper lake.\r\n\r\nThe FLAG TOWER, near the house, is a prospect-tower of six stories\r\nin height. It is a massive square building with circular turrets at\r\nits angles. The view from the top is one of the most beautiful and\r\nextensive which the country can boast—embracing the house, gardens,\r\ngrounds, and broad domains of Alton Towers; the village of Alton\r\nwith its church and parsonage; the ruins of the old castle of the De\r\nVerduns; the new monastic buildings—the Hospital of St. John, the\r\nInstitution, the Nunnery, and the Chapel; the valley of the Churnet;\r\nToot Hill; and the distant country stretching out for miles around.\r\n\r\nINA’S ROCK is one of the many interesting spots in the grounds. It is\r\nabout three-quarters of a mile from the Towers, on what is called the\r\n“Rock Walk.” It is said that after a great battle fought near the spot\r\n(on a place still called the “battle-field”), between Ceolred and Ina,\r\nKings of Mercia and Wessex, the latter chieftain held a parliament at\r\nthis rock; whence it takes its names. We have thus guided the reader\r\nthrough the house and grounds of Alton Towers.\r\n\r\nThe district around Alton Towers is rich in interesting places, and\r\nin beautiful localities where the visitor may while away many an hour\r\nin enjoyment. The monastic buildings, on the site of old Alton Castle,\r\nare charmingly situated, and deserve a few words at our hands. These\r\nwe quote from Mr. Jewitt’s “Alton Towers:”—“The monastic buildings,\r\nwhich form such a striking and picturesque object from the railway\r\nstation, and indeed from many points in the surrounding neighbourhood,\r\nwere erected from the designs, and under the immediate superintendence,\r\nof the late Mr. Pugin, and are, for stern simplicity and picturesque\r\narrangement, perhaps the most successful of all his works. The\r\nbuildings have never been—and probably never will be—completed, and\r\nthey remain a sad instance of the mutability of human plans. Commenced\r\nat the suggestion, and carried out at the expense, of a Roman Catholic\r\nnobleman; planned and erected by a Roman Catholic architect; and\r\nintended as a permanent establishment for Roman Catholic priests, &c.,\r\n&c., the buildings rose in great pride and beauty, and were continued\r\nwith the utmost spirit, until the death of Earl Bertram, when, after\r\nthe trials I have recounted, the estates passed into Protestant hands,\r\nthe works were at once discontinued, and the buildings have since been\r\nallowed, with the exception of the chapel and the apartments devoted\r\nto the residence of a priest (and the school), to become dilapidated.\r\nThe castle grounds on which these buildings are erected are situated\r\nnear the church, the buildings forming three sides of a quadrangle—one\r\nbeing the school and institution, and the others the cloisters,\r\npriest’s house, chapel, and other buildings. From this the moat is\r\ncrossed by a wooden bridge to the ruins of the castle and the hospital\r\nof St. John. The buildings are beautifully shown on the engraving on\r\nthe next page.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Part of the Grounds._]\r\n\r\n“The erection of these Roman Catholic buildings gave rise to much\r\nannoyance, and much ill-feeling was engendered in the neighbourhood;\r\nand a hoax was played on Pugin, whose susceptibilities were strong and\r\nhasty. It was as follows: One day—of all days ‘April fool day’—he\r\nreceived the following letter:—\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Alton—Hospital of St. John._]\r\n\r\n“‘Dear Sir—It is with deep sorrow that I venture to inform you of a\r\ncircumstance which has just come to my knowledge; and, though an entire\r\nstranger, I take the liberty of addressing you, being aware of your\r\nzeal for the _honour_ and welfare of the Catholic Church. What, then,\r\nwill be your grief and indignation (if you have not already heard it)\r\nat being told that—fearing the bazaar, in behalf of the Monastery of\r\nSt. Bernard, may prove unsuccessful—it has been thought that more\r\npeople would be drawn to it were the _monks to hold the stalls_! Was\r\nthere ever such a scandal given to our most holy religion? It may\r\nhave been done ignorantly or innocently; but it is enough to make a\r\nCatholic of feeling shudder! _I_ am not in a situation to have the\r\nslightest influence in putting an end to this most dreadful proceeding;\r\nbut knowing you to be well acquainted with the head of the English\r\nCatholics—the good Earl of Shrewsbury—would you not write to him,\r\nand request him to use his influence (which must be great) in stopping\r\nthe _sacrilege_, for such it really is? Think of your Holy Church thus\r\n_degraded_ and made a by-word in the mouths of Protestants! I know how\r\nyou love and venerate her. Aid her then now, and attempt to rescue her\r\nfrom this calamity! Pray excuse the freedom with which I have written,\r\nand believe me, dear sir, A SINCERE LOVER OF MY CHURCH, BUT AN ENEMY TO\r\nTHE PROTESTANT PRINCIPLE OF BAZAARS.’\r\n\r\n“Pugin wrote immediately to the earl in an impassioned strain, but,\r\nin reference to this trick, when the light had at length dawned upon\r\nhim, in writing to Lord Shrewsbury, he says—‘I have found out at\r\nlast that the alarm about the monks at the bazaar was all a hoax; and\r\nrumour mentions some ladies, not far distant from the Towers, as the\r\nauthors. I must own it was capitally done, and put me into a perfect\r\nfever for some days. I only read the letter late in the day, and sent a\r\nperson all the way to the General Post Office to save the post. I never\r\ngave the day of the month a moment’s consideration. I shall be better\r\nprepared for the next 1st of April.’\r\n\r\n“The school, which was intended also as a literary institution, a hall,\r\nand a lecture-room for Alton, will be seen to the right on entering\r\nthe grounds; the house, to the left, now occupied as a convent, being\r\nintended for a residence of the schoolmaster. In the original design\r\nthe cloistered part of the establishment was intended to be the convent\r\n(the chapel being a nuns’ chapel), and the parish church of Alton\r\nwas intended to be rebuilt in the same style as the splendid church\r\nat Cheadle. The hospital was to be for decayed priests. The chapel\r\nis a beautiful little building, highly decorated in character, and\r\nremarkably pure and good in proportions. In it, to the north of the\r\naltar, are buried Earl John and his Countess, and to the south Earl\r\nBertram. The following are the inscriptions on the brasses to their\r\nmemory:—\r\n\r\n “‘Hic jacet corpus Johannis quondam Comitis Salopiæ XVI. qui hunc\r\n Sacellum et hospitium construere fecit A.D. MDCCCXLIV. Orate pro anima\r\n misserimi peccatoris obiit Neapoli die IX No MDCCCLII Ætatis suæ LXI.’\r\n\r\n “‘In Memoriam Mariæ Teresiæ, Johannis Comitis Salopiæ Viduæ, Natæ\r\n Wexfordiæ XXII Maii MDCCXCV. Parissis obiit IV Junii MDCCCLVI quorum\r\n animas Viventium Amor Sanctissimus incor unum conflasse Videbatur\r\n corpora eodem sepulchro deposita misericordiam ejusdem redemptoris\r\n expectant. R.I.P.’\r\n\r\n “‘Orate pro anima Bertrami Artheri Talbot XVII Com: Salop: ob: die:\r\n 10º August 1856. Requiescat in pace.’\r\n\r\n“In the cloisters is another beautiful brass, on which is the following\r\ninscription:—\r\n\r\n “‘Good Christian people of your charity pray for the soul of Mistress\r\n Anne Talbot wife of Will^m Talbot Esquire of Castle Talbot Wexford\r\n who died on the V day of May A.D. MDCCCXLIV. Also for the soul of the\r\n above named Will^m Talbot Esq^{re} who died the II^{nd} day of Aug^t\r\n MDCCCXLIX aged LXXXVI years. May they rest in peace.’\r\n\r\n“On a slab on the floor:—\r\n\r\n “‘Of your charity pray for the soul of Sister Mary Joseph Healy of the\r\n Order of Mercy. Who died 4th August 1857 in the 31st year of her age,\r\n and the 5th of her Religious Profession. R.I.P.’\r\n\r\n“On a brass:—\r\n\r\n “‘Orato pro anima Domini Caroli quondam Comitis Salopiæ qui obiit VI\r\n die Aprilis anno domini MDCCCXXVII Ætatis suæ LXIV.’”[3]\r\n\r\nALTON CHURCH is also worthy of a visit, not because of any special\r\narchitectural features which it contains, but because of its commanding\r\nsituation and its near proximity to the Castle. It is of Norman\r\nfoundation. The village itself (visitors to the locality will be glad\r\nto learn that it contains a very comfortable inn, the “Wheatsheaf”) is\r\nlarge and very picturesque, and its immediate neighbourhood abounds in\r\ndelightful walks and in glorious “bits” of scenery.\r\n\r\nDEMON’S DALE—a haunted place concerning which many strange stories are\r\ncurrent—is also about a mile from Alton, and is highly picturesque.\r\n\r\nCROXDEN ABBEY (or Crokesden Abbey) is a grand old ruin, within an easy\r\nwalk of Alton. It was founded by Bertram de Verdun, owner of Alton\r\nCastle, in 1176.\r\n\r\nIt will be readily understood that the renown of Alton Towers arises\r\nprincipally from the garden and grounds by which the mansion is\r\nenvironed. But if to nature it is indebted for its hills and dells, its\r\nsteep ascents and graceful undulations, art has done much to augment\r\nits attractions. It may have been a “desert” when Earl Charles strove,\r\nand successfully, to convert it into a paradise; but the rough material\r\nwas ready to his hand, and to taste, with judicious expenditure, the\r\ntask was not difficult to make it what it became, and now is—one of\r\nthe most exquisitely beautiful demesnes in the British dominions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOBHAM HALL.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE county of Kent is one of the pleasantest of the English shires;\r\nrich in cultivated and pictorial beauty, it has been aptly and justly\r\ncalled “the garden of England.” Patrician trees are found everywhere:\r\nfor centuries the hand of ruthless and reckless war has never touched\r\nthem; its chalky soil is redolent of health; its pasture lands are\r\nproverbially fertile; its gentle hills are nowhere barren; in many\r\nparts it borders the sea; and to-day, as it did ages ago,—\r\n\r\n                          “It doth advance\r\n  A haughty brow against the coast of France;”\r\n\r\nthe men of Kent are, as they ever have been, and by God’s blessing ever\r\nwill be, the “vanguard of liberty.” Moreover, it is rich, above all\r\nother counties, in traditions and antiquities; some of its customs have\r\ncontinued unchanged for centuries; its ecclesiastical pre-eminence is\r\nstill retained; while some of the noblest and most perfect of British\r\nbaronial mansions are to be found in the graciously endowed county that\r\nborders the metropolis.\r\n\r\nAmong the most perfect of its stately mansions is that to which we\r\nintroduce the reader—Cobham Hall, the seat of the Earl of Darnley,\r\nBaron Clifton.[4] Its proximity to the metropolis—from which, if we\r\nmeasure distances by time, it is separated by little more than an\r\nhour—would alone supply a sufficient motive for its selection into\r\nthis series. It is situated about four miles south-east of Gravesend,\r\nnearly midway between that town and Rochester, but a mile or so out of\r\nthe direct road. The narrow coach-paths which lead to it are shaded by\r\npleasant hedgerows, and run between lines of hop-gardens—the comely\r\nvineyards of England.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cobham Hall._]\r\n\r\nThe mansion stands in the midst of scenery of surpassing loveliness,\r\nalternating hill and valley, rich in “patrician trees” and “plebeian\r\nunderwood,” dotted with pretty cottages, and interspersed with\r\nprimitive villages: while here and there are scattered “old houses” of\r\nred brick, with their carved wooden gables and tall twisted chimneys;\r\nand glimpses are caught occasionally of the all-glorious Thames. A\r\nvisit to Cobham Hall, therefore, furnishes a most refreshing and\r\ninvigorating luxury to dwellers in the metropolis; and the liberality\r\nof its noble owner adds to the rich banquet of Nature as rare a treat\r\nas can be supplied by Art. The Hall, independent of the interest it\r\nderives from its quaint architecture, its fine, although not unmixed,\r\nremains of the Tudor style, contains a gallery of pictures, by the best\r\nmasters of the most famous schools, large in number and of rare value.\r\n\r\nBefore we commence our description of the Hall, the demesne, the\r\nChurch, the College, and the village of Cobham,[5] it is necessary that\r\nwe supply some information concerning the several families under whose\r\nguardianship they have flourished.\r\n\r\nCobham Hall has not descended from sire to son through many\r\ngenerations. Its present lord is in no way, or at least but remotely,\r\nconnected with the ancient family who for centuries governed the “men\r\nof Kent,” and who, at one period, possessed power second only to that\r\nof the sovereign. That race of bold barons has been long extinct, the\r\nlast of them dying in miserable poverty; and if their proud blood is\r\nstill to be found within their once princely barony, it runs, probably,\r\nthrough the veins of some tiller of the soil.\r\n\r\nThe Cobhams had been famous from the earliest recorded times. In\r\nPhilipot’s “Survey of Kent”—1659—it is said that “Cobham afforded a\r\nseat and a surname to that noble and splendid family; and certainly,”\r\nadds the quaint old writer, “this place was the cradle or seminary of\r\npersons who, in elder ages, were invested in places of as signall and\r\nprincipal a trust or eminence, as they could move in, in the narrow\r\norbe of a particular county.” In the reign of King John, Henry de\r\nCobham gave 1,000 marks to the king for his favour. He left three sons,\r\nviz., John, who was Sheriff of Kent, Justice of Common Pleas, and Judge\r\nItinerant; Reginald, also Sheriff of Kent, Constable of Dover Castle,\r\nand Warden of the Cinque Ports; and William, also Justice Itinerant.\r\nThe eldest, John de Cobham, was succeeded by his son John, who in turn\r\nbecame Sheriff of Kent, one of the Justices of King’s Bench and Common\r\nPleas, and Baron of the Exchequer. His son Henry de Cobham was Governor\r\nof Guernsey and Jersey, Constable of Dover Castle, and Warden of the\r\nCinque Ports; so was also, again, _his_ son Henry, who likewise was\r\nGovernor of Tunbridge Castle, and was summoned to Parliament 6 to 9\r\nEdward III. He was succeeded by his son John de Cobham, Admiral of the\r\nFleet, Justice of _Oyer_ and _Terminer_, and Ambassador to France, who\r\nin “10 Richard II. was one of the thirteen appointed by the predominant\r\nlords to govern the realm, but was after impeached for treason, and\r\nhad judgment pronounced against him, but obtained pardon, being sent\r\nprisoner to the island of Jersey.” Dying in the ninth year of Henry\r\nIV., he left his granddaughter, Joan, his heiress. This lady married\r\nfor her third husband Sir John Oldcastle, who assumed the title of Lord\r\nCobham. Reginald de Cobham, half brother to John, was Justice of King’s\r\nBench, an Admiral, an Ambassador to the Pope, and commander of the van\r\nof the army at Crecy. He was succeeded by his son, Reginald de Cobham,\r\nwho likewise was succeeded by _his_ son Reginald; he left an only\r\ndaughter as heir.\r\n\r\nNo less than four Kentish gentlemen of the name embarked with the first\r\nEdward in his “victorious and triumphant expedition into Scotland,” and\r\nwere knighted for services rendered to that prince in his “successful\r\nand auspicious siege of Caerlaverock.” With Reginald de Cobham, as has\r\nbeen shown, the male line determined. Joan, his daughter, is said to\r\nhave had five husbands, by only one of whom, Sir Reginald Braybrooke,\r\nshe left issue, Joan, who being married to Sir Thomas Broke, of the\r\ncounty of Somerset, Knight, “knitt Cobham, and a large income beside,\r\nto her husband’s patrimony.”[6]\r\n\r\nTheir eldest son, Sir Edward Broke, was summoned to parliament,\r\nas Baron Cobham, in the 23rd Henry VI. In 1559 Sir William Broke\r\nentertained Queen Elizabeth at Cobham Hall, in the first year of her\r\nreign, “with a noble welcome as she took her progress through the\r\ncounty of Kent.” His son and successor, Henry, Lord Cobham, was Lord\r\nWarden of the Cinque Ports; but “being too deeply concerned in the\r\ndesign of Sir Walter Raleigh,” he was deprived of his estates, though\r\nnot his life.[7]\r\n\r\nHis younger brother, George, was executed; but Cobham “lived many\r\nyears after in great misery and poverty,” dying in January, 1619;\r\nand sharing the humble grave of some lowly peasant, apart from the\r\nmagnificent tombs which cover the remains of his great and gallant\r\nancestors. He is said, by Weldon, to have been reduced to such extreme\r\nnecessity, that “he had starved, but for a trencher-scraper, some time\r\nhis servant at court, who relieved him with scraps.”\r\n\r\nA sister of Lord Cobham’s was married to Secretary Sir Robert Cecil:\r\nhis estimable and greatly beloved lady died in January, 1596-7. She was\r\nalso a kinswoman of Sir Walter Raleigh, and in one of his letters to\r\nCecil he says:—“It is trew that you have lost a good and vertuous wife\r\nand my sealf an honorable frinde and kinswoman. Butt ther was a tyme\r\nwhen shee was unknowne to you, for whom you then lamented not. Shee\r\nis now no more your’s, nor of your acquayntance, butt immortall, and\r\nnot needinge nor knowynge your love or sorrow. Therfor you shall but\r\ngreve for that which now is as it was, when not your’s; only bettered\r\nby the differance in this, that shee hath past the weresome jurney of\r\nthis darke worlde, and hath possession of her inheritance. Shee hath\r\nleft behind her the frute of her love, for whos sakes you ought to take\r\ncare for your sealf, that you leve them not without a gwyde, and not\r\nby grevinge to repine att His will that gave them yow, or by sorrowing\r\nto dry upp your own tymes that ought to establish them.” This lady was\r\nsister to two of the unhappy conspirators of 1603 and kinswoman to the\r\nthird, as well as being wife of the chief officer of state by whom\r\nthese conspiracies had to be brought to light. Well therefore was it,\r\nfor her, that her pure spirit had taken its flight before the time of\r\nattainder of her brothers, Henry, Lord Cobham, and George Broke, and\r\ntheir baseness by falsity and otherwise in leading the much-injured\r\nRaleigh to the scaffold. “Whatever mysteries,” says Mr. Edwards, “may\r\nyet hang over the plots and counterplots of 1603, it is certain that\r\nGeorge Broke proved in the issue to have been the _instrument_ of the\r\nruin alike of his brother Cobham and of Raleigh. It is also certain\r\nthat mere ‘credulity of the practices of malice and envy’ could never\r\nhave ripened, save in a very congenial soil, into the consummate\r\nbaseness displayed both in the examinations and in some of the letters\r\nof George Broke after his arrest. In certain particulars his baseness\r\nexceeded his brother Cobham’s, and that is saying not a little as\r\nto its depth.” His estates, at the time of their confiscation, are\r\nestimated to have been worth £7,000 per annum; and he possessed £30,000\r\nin goods and chattels. His nephew was restored in blood; but not to\r\nthe title or property. These were transferred—“the manor and seat of\r\nCobham Hall, and the rest of Lord Cobham’s lands”—by James I. to one\r\nof his kinsmen, Ludovick Stuart, Duke of Lennox, whose male line became\r\nextinct in 1672.\r\n\r\nThe Lady Katherine, sister of the last Duke of Richmond and Lennox,\r\nmarried into the princely family of the O’Briens of Thomond; but the\r\nDuke “dying greatly in debt” the estates were sold. Cobham Hall was\r\npurchased by the second husband of the Lady Katherine, Sir Joseph\r\nWilliamson, who resided there for some time.[8] In 1701 he died,\r\nbequeathing two-thirds of his property to his widow. This proportion\r\ndescended, on her demise, to Edward Lord Clifton and Cornbury,\r\nafterwards Lord Clarendon, who had married the sole child of this Lady\r\nKatherine, by her first husband, Henry Lord O’Brien;[9] and on Lord\r\nClarendon’s death without issue, in 1713, his sister, Lady Theodosia\r\nHyde, inherited; she married John Bligh, of the kingdom of Ireland,\r\nEsq.; created, in 1721, an Irish peer by the title of Lord Clifton of\r\nRathmore, and, in 1725, Earl of Darnley in that kingdom.\r\n\r\nFor some years the Cobham estate was in Chancery. After a tedious suit\r\nit was purchased by Lord Darnley for the sum of £51,000, to the third\r\npart of which a Mrs. Hornby became entitled, as relict of the gentleman\r\nto whom Sir Joseph Williamson had devised one third part.[10]\r\n\r\nThe Blighs are an ancient family, connected with Devonshire and other\r\nparts of the West of England as well as with Ireland. One of them,\r\na merchant of Plymouth, an ancestor of the present peer, married\r\nCatherine Fuller, sister to William Fuller, Bishop of Limerick and\r\nLincoln (1667-1675). In 1721 John Bligh of Rathmore, in the kingdom of\r\nIreland, Esquire, who had married the Lady Theodosia Hyde, sister to\r\nEdward, Earl of Clarendon (whose wife Catherine, daughter of Katherine\r\nLady Thomond, who had successfully claimed the barony of Clifton of\r\nLeighton Bromswold, in the peerage of the United Kingdom, as being\r\ndescended from the first Lord Clifton, inherited the said barony from\r\nher mother), from whom he inherited the title and the estates, was\r\ncreated Baron Clifton of Rathmere, in the kingdom of Ireland, in 1721.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Three Sisters._]\r\n\r\nIn 1723 he was created Viscount Darnley of Athboy, and in 1725 Earl\r\nof Darnley, both in the peerage of Ireland. He also succeeded to the\r\ntitle of Baron Clifton of Leighton Bromswold, in the peerage of the\r\nUnited Kingdom, by which title he and his successors sit in the House\r\nof Lords. His lordship was succeeded, as second Earl of Darnley, by\r\nhis son, who was again, on his death, succeeded by his son John, as\r\nthird earl. This nobleman, who was born in 1719, married in 1766 Mary,\r\ndaughter and heiress of John Stoyt, of Street, co. Westmeath, and by\r\nher, who died in 1803, had issue John, afterwards fourth earl; Lady\r\nMary, married to Sir Lawrence Palk, Bart.; the Hon. Edward Bligh, a\r\ngeneral in the army; Lady Theodosia, married to her cousin, Thomas\r\nCherbourgh Bligh; Lady Catherine, married to Hon. Charles William\r\nStewart, afterwards Marquis of Londonderry; and the Hon. William, a\r\ncolonel in the army. The Earl died in 1781, and was succeeded by his\r\nson John, as fourth earl. He married, in 1791, Elizabeth, daughter\r\nof the Right Hon. William Brownlow of Lurgan, and by her had issue\r\nEdward, fifth earl; Lady Mary, married to Charles Brownlow, Esq.; Hon.\r\nJohn Duncan Bligh, Secretary of Legation at St. Petersburgh; and the\r\nLady Elizabeth, married to the Rev. J. Brownlow. His lordship died\r\nin 1831, and was succeeded by his son Edward, fifth earl, who (born\r\nin 1795), married in 1825 Emma Jane, third daughter of Sir Henry\r\nBrooke Parnell, Bart., M.P.,—who, having held office as Secretary\r\nat War, Paymaster-General of the Forces, and Treasurer of the Navy\r\nand Ordnance, was created Baron Congleton in 1841,—and sister to the\r\npresent Lord Congleton. By this lady, who is still living, his lordship\r\nhad issue, John Stuart Bligh, sixth and present earl of Darnley; the\r\nHon. and Rev. Edward Vesey Bligh; the Hon. and Rev. Henry Bligh; the\r\nLady Elizabeth Caroline, and the Lady Emma Bess, both of whom are\r\nmarried and bear the name of Cust—the first being the wife of Reginald\r\nCust, Esq., and the latter the wife of the Rev. Arthur Perceval\r\nPurey-Cust. His lordship died in 1835, and was succeeded by his eldest\r\nson, John Stuart Bligh, as sixth earl.\r\n\r\nThe present peer, John Stuart Bligh, sixth Earl of Darnley, Viscount\r\nDarnley of Athboy, Baron Clifton of Leighton Bromswold, and Baron\r\nClifton of Rathmore, was born in 1827, and was educated at Eton and\r\nChrist Church, Oxford, being B.A. in 1848, and M.A. in 1851. He married\r\nin 1850 the Lady Harriet Mary Pelham, eldest daughter of the third\r\nEarl of Chichester, and has by her issue, living, the Hon. Edward\r\nHenry Stuart Bligh, Lord Clifton, who was born in 1851; the Hon. Ivo\r\nFrancis Walter Bligh, born 1859; the Hon. Arthur Frederick Pelham\r\nBligh, born 1865; the Lady Edith Louisa Mary, born 1853; the Lady\r\nKathleen Susan Emma, born 1854; the Lady Alice Isabella Harriet, born\r\n1860; the Lady Mary Rose Florence, born 1868; and the Lady Constance\r\nViolet Lucy, born in 1869. His lordship is a Deputy Lieutenant of the\r\ncounty of Kent; Hereditary High Steward of Gravesend with Milton; and\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Commandant of the West Kent Yeomanry Cavalry. He is\r\npatron of the living of Cobham. He has, besides Cobham Hall, a seat in\r\nIreland, Clifton Lodge, Athboy, co. Meath, and a town residence.\r\n\r\nThe arms of the Earl of Darnley are:—_Azure_, a griffin segreant,\r\n_or_, between three crescents, _argent_. Crest:—A griffin’s head,\r\nerased, _or_, Supporters:—Two griffins, wings elevated, _or_, ducally\r\ncollared and chained, _azure_. Motto:—“_Finem Respice_.”\r\n\r\nSuch is a brief history of the several noble families through whom the\r\nmansion, demesne, and estates of Cobham have passed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Lodge._]\r\n\r\nThe Hall is backed by a noble park, amply stocked with deer, and\r\ncontaining trees of great variety and immense size, some of them\r\nmeasuring above thirty feet in circumference. It comprises 1,800\r\nacres, and encloses an area of about seven miles. The old approach,\r\nlong disused, was through an avenue of lime trees, consisting of four\r\nrows, and extending more than half a mile in length from the dependent\r\nvillage. The present entrance is through a red-brick, turreted\r\ngateway, adjacent to which is the “LODGE.” On nearing the house, the\r\neye encounters a cedar of magnificent growth, and to the left are the\r\ngardens, into which there are two terrace-walks—one from the great\r\ngate, and another, at a considerable elevation, from the suite of\r\napartments which constitute the first floor. The view we have given\r\nis the more ancient portion of the venerable edifice—the north wing,\r\nwith which the south wing mainly corresponds. They are, however,\r\nconnected by a centre, built by Inigo Jones; and this centre, which\r\nconsists of a façade with Corinthian pilasters, is out of keeping with\r\nthe quaint gables, octagonal turrets, ornamental doorways, carved\r\ncornices, projecting mullioned windows, and elaborated chimneys,\r\nwhich distinguish the earlier dwelling of the Cobhams. The structure\r\nthus assumes the form of a half H, the wings being terminated by\r\noctagonal towers; a sunken wall in front encloses a quadrangular\r\nlawn, ornamented with vases and statues. The wings exhibit the dates\r\n1582 and 1594, and retain all the characteristics of the later\r\nTudor style; although, as we have intimated, it has been materially\r\ncorrupted by the several alterations to which, from time to time,\r\nthe mansion has been subjected. The ordinary entrance is through a\r\nvaulted passage, “built in the form of a Gothic cloister by James\r\nWyatt,” which contains the arms of the Cobhams, with the date 1587.\r\nThis passage leads to the grand staircase, and the several apartments\r\non the ground-floor. The first to which strangers are conducted is\r\nthe dining-hall, which contains an elaborately carved black-and-white\r\nmarble chimney-piece, having quaint and curious figures and buildings,\r\nand a series of portraits of rare excellence. The Music-room, one of\r\nthe suite added to the ancient building, affords a brilliant contrast\r\nto the sombre and solid character of the dining-room. It contains\r\nbut one picture—full-length portraits of the Lords John and Bernard\r\nStuart, sons of the Duke of Lennox—a _chef-d’œvre_ of Vandyke. The\r\nchimney-piece is formed of the purest white marble, sculptured in\r\nbas-relief after Guido’s “Aurora,” by the elder Westmacott, with fauns\r\nlife-size, as supporters. The ceiling was designed by Inigo Jones;\r\nit is divided into several square and circular compartments, with a\r\ndeep oval in the centre, “superbly gilt and enriched by appropriate\r\nornaments, among which are twelve pendant coronets.” The apartment is\r\nin length 50 feet, in breadth 36 feet, and height 32 feet! and although\r\nsuperbly ornamented and richly gilt—the pillars of the Composite\r\norder, being of white marble, and the lining of scagliola—the whole is\r\nin fine harmony with the grace and chasteness of the design. There are\r\ntwo galleries, one of which contains an organ. The vestibule is a small\r\nchamber, decorated with valuable vases of verd-antique. The Library\r\ncontains a series of portraits of eminent literary men—Bolingbroke,\r\nSidney, Shakespere, Swift, and others; none of them, however, advance\r\nstrong claims to originality. On the walls of the Great Staircase are\r\nhung several large pictures, which may bear examination before the\r\ngallery is entered.\r\n\r\nThe grand staircase conducts, first to the Portrait Gallery, and\r\nnext to the Picture Gallery. The walls of the former are hung with\r\nportraits, among which are many of exceeding interest, including those\r\nof heroes, statesmen, kings and queens, church reformers, and poets,\r\nmingled without regard to date or order. At the end of this gallery\r\nare, branching to the right and left, the private apartments of the\r\nfamily; and in a room opening out of the west end of the Picture\r\nGallery, Queen Elizabeth is reported to have slept when she honoured\r\nthe Lord Cobham with a visit during her progress through Kent. In the\r\ncentre of the ancient ceiling are still preserved her arms, with the\r\ndate, 1599. The Picture Gallery is the great “show-room” of the house.\r\nIt is a noble apartment, the walls of which are covered with works\r\nof Art, of rare value and unsurpassed excellence, the productions of\r\nnearly all the great masters of Italy—including admirable examples\r\nof Guido, Titian, Salvator Rosa, Rubens, Raphael, Spagnoletto, P.\r\nVeronese, Giorgione, N. Poussin, and Guercino.\r\n\r\nEvery part of the venerable edifice contains, indeed, some object of\r\ninterest. The rooms, and halls, and galleries are thronged with rare\r\nand beautiful works of Art; a series of perfect vases from Herculaneum\r\nlie on the tables of the Picture Gallery; several antique busts and\r\nstatues line the hall; a magnificent bath, of red Egyptian granite,\r\nis placed in the entrance passage; and the furniture and interior\r\ndecorations are all of corresponding excellence and beauty.\r\n\r\nAlthough necessarily limited in our description of Cobham Hall, we\r\nhave sufficiently shown the rare treat a visit to it will afford those\r\nwho, “in populous city pent,” desire to convert occasional holidays\r\ninto contributions to intellectual enjoyment. The Hall and its contents\r\nwill amply repay examination; and the noble park is full of natural\r\ntreasures—thronged with deer, singularly abundant in singing birds,\r\nand containing trees unsurpassed in magnificent size and graceful\r\nproportions. A group of these trees, known as “the Three Sisters”\r\n(why we cannot say), we have engraved. One of the walks conducts to\r\na hillock, from the summit of which there is a splendid prospect of\r\nthe adjacent country, commanding views of the Thames and Medway, and\r\ntaking in the venerable castle, cathedral, and town of Rochester, the\r\ndockyards at Sheerness, and the whole course of the great English river\r\nto its mouth at the Nore. The pedestrian, pursuing this route, will\r\npass the Mausoleum, an elegant structure, built conformably with the\r\nwill of the third Earl of Darnley, and designed for the sepulture of\r\nhis family. It was never consecrated.\r\n\r\nBut Cobham has other objects of interest: the venerable Church, and\r\nno less venerable “College.” The “CHURCH,” dedicated to St. Mary\r\nMagdalen, stands upon elevated ground at the entrance of the village.\r\nIt consists of a nave, aisles, and chancel, with an embattled tower,\r\nentered by an antique porch. The tower is obviously of a more recent\r\ndate than the chancel; the former is very ancient. As in many of the\r\nKentish churches, the walls were formerly painted in fresco, of which\r\nevidence may be easily obtained by those who examine them narrowly;\r\nthe steps of the altar are paved with encaustic tiles, of about the\r\nperiod of Edward III., of various patterns, but most of them containing\r\nthe _fleur-de-lis_. The whole aspect of the place indeed supplies\r\nindubitable proof of very remote antiquity. It has been recently\r\nrestored, but with sound judgment and skill, by the accomplished\r\narchitect, Sir Gilbert Scott, R.A.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Interior of the Church._]\r\n\r\nThe roof of huge oak rafters, the Gothic arches, the brasses, broken\r\nand entire, which cover the floor, the quaint monuments let into the\r\nwalls, the delicately-sculptured piscina, the sedilia of carved stone,\r\nthe singular font, the rude vestry-room with its massive oak chest, the\r\nScripture passages painted on the walls, all bespeak the antiquity of\r\nthe building.\r\n\r\n“Nearly in the centre is the still beautiful tomb of Sir Thomas Broke,\r\nthe Lady Joan, and their ten sons and four daughters. It is of white\r\nmarble, over which, upon a black slab, lie the effigies of the knight\r\nand dame. On either side are those of five of their sons, kneeling, and\r\nwearing tabards, with their swords girded on. The figures of the four\r\ndaughters are carved on the east and west ends of the superb monument.\r\nIt bears the date 1561, under the arms of the Brokes quartered with\r\nthose of the Cobhams.\r\n\r\n“On the floor of the chancel are the famous ‘Cobham Brasses,’ the most\r\nperfect and most numerous assemblage now existing in the kingdom. The\r\nseries consists of thirteen, recording the memory of the Cobhams and\r\nBrokes, ‘lords and barons of this manor of Cobham, with many of their\r\nkindred, who for many descents did flourish in honourable reputation.’\r\nOf the thirteen, eight are in honour of the knights, and five are\r\nmemorials of the dames. These brasses, one and all, deserve the most\r\ncareful examination and notice. The earliest is to the memory of _John\r\nde Cobham_, the first Knight Banneret, and Constable of Rochester;\r\nhe is dressed in a shirt of mail: round his waist is a rich girdle,\r\nsustaining a long sword. Eight lines of Norman French are inscribed\r\nround the verge of the slab. The others are to _Maude, Lady Cobham_\r\n(1370), probably wife of Baron Cobham, who was Warden of the Cinque\r\nPorts in the time of Edward III., who is represented with a dog at her\r\nfeet. Over her head are the words ‘Icy gist dame Maude de Cobham.’\r\n_Maude, Lady Cobham_ (c. 1385) supposed to have been the wife of Thomas\r\nde Cobham. She has a flounce of fur at the bottom of her dress. There\r\nare the remains of a mutilated canopy over her, and a fragment of\r\ninscription says, ‘Icy gist dame Maude de Cobehm qe....’ _Margaret,\r\nLady Cobham_ (1385), wife of John de Cobham, the founder of Cobham\r\nCollege. This is a remarkably beautiful canopied brass; the finial of\r\nthe canopy bearing a figure of the Virgin and Child. Around the brass\r\nis the inscription, ‘Isy gist dame Margarete de Cobeham, iadiis fille\r\na noble en le Comte de Deuenischire; feme le sire de Cobeham, foundour\r\nde ... morust le secounde in dimoys D’agust lan de grace, MCCCLXXXV.,\r\nlalme de qy deux eut mercy. Amen.’ _Joan, Lady Cobham_ (c. 1320), who\r\nwas daughter of John, Lord Beauchamp of Stoke-under-Hamden, and first\r\nwife of Sir John de Cobham. The inscription, in Longobardic capitals,\r\nis:—\r\n\r\n  “‘Dame Jone de Kobeham gist isi\r\n  Deus de sa alme eit merci\r\n  Kike pur le Alme Priera\r\n  Quaraunte jours de pardoun avera.’”\r\n\r\n_Reginald de Cobham_ (c. 1420), an ecclesiastic, under a triple canopy,\r\nthe shaft and some other portions being lost. _Sir Thomas de Cobham_, a\r\nknight in mixed armour, 1367.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The College Porch._]\r\n\r\n_Ralph de Cobham_, 1405, a semi-effigy in armour, holding in his hands\r\na tablet, bearing the inscription in old English characters. _John de\r\nCobham_, the founder of the College, bearing in his hands the model\r\nof a church. _John Broke_ and _Lady Margaret_ his wife, under a rich\r\ncanopy with pendants and other ornaments, with triangular compartments,\r\ncontaining circles with shields, one of which bears the crown of\r\nthorns, and the other the five wounds; between the pinnacles, in the\r\ncentre, is a curious representation of the Trinity, in which the Deity\r\nis delineated with a triple crown, and the Holy Spirit has a human\r\nface. The figure of the knight is gone, but that of his lady remains;\r\nand beneath are groups of eight sons and ten daughters. _Sir Reginald\r\nBraybroke_, the second husband of Joan, Lady Cobham. _Sir Nicholas\r\nHauberk_, her third husband. _Joan de Cobham_: she died, as appears\r\nfrom the inscription, ‘on the day of St. Hilary the Bishop, A.D.\r\n1433.’ At her feet are six sons and four daughters; and surrounding\r\nher, are six escutcheons of the Cobham arms and alliances. _Sir Thomas\r\nBroke_ and one of his three wives. Below them are seven sons and five\r\ndaughters. Sir Thomas died 1529.”\r\n\r\n“The COLLEGE of Cobham” is now only a collection of almshouses, to\r\nwhich presentations are made—of old people, without restriction to\r\neither sex—as vacancies occur, by the parish and ten other parishes\r\nadjacent. It lies immediately south of the church, and is entered\r\nby a small Gothic gateway. Its occupants are twenty aged men and\r\nwomen, who have each a little dwelling, with a neat garden and an\r\nallowance monthly, sufficient to secure the necessaries of life. It\r\nis a quadrangular building, of stone, measuring about 60 feet by 50;\r\nand contains a large hall, with painted windows, a roof of blackened\r\nrafters, an old oak screen, and a fire-place of cut stone. The history\r\nof the college is curious and interesting. A college or chantry was\r\noriginally founded here, about the year 1362, by John de Cobham, thence\r\ncalled “the founder,” in the reign of Edward III. In the Church is a\r\nbrass to the memory of William Tanner, Master of the College, who died\r\nin 1418. The brass consists of a half-length of the master, in clerical\r\ncostume, with the inscription in black letter:—“Hic jacet Willmus\r\nTannere qui prim obiit magister istuis Collegii xxii. die mensis\r\nJunii Anno Dni. M°CCCC°XVIII. cujus anime propicietur deus Amen.”\r\nTowards the end of the reign of Elizabeth it was rebuilt, as appears\r\nby a record—“finished in September 1598”—inscribed over the south\r\nportal, under the arms and alliances of the Brokes, Lords Cobham. The\r\nendowments of the old foundation were ample, and were, with the college\r\nitself, bestowed by Henry VIII., at the dissolution, upon George, Lord\r\nCobham, who had the “king’s roiall assent and licence by hys grace’s\r\nword, with any manner of letters patent or other writings, to purchase\r\nand receyve to his heires for ever, of the late master and brethren, of\r\nthe college or chauntry of Cobham, in the countie of Kent, now being\r\nutterly dissolved, the scite of the same colledge or chauntry, and al\r\nand singular their heridaments and possessions, as well temporall as\r\necclesiasticall, wheresoever they lay, or were, within the realm of\r\nEngland.” The walls of the ancient college may be clearly traced, and a\r\nsmall portion still endures, comparatively uninjured. It is a gateway,\r\nsurmounted by the arms of the Cobhams, luxuriantly overgrown with ivy,\r\nforming a fine example of picturesque antiquity. The present structure\r\nwas erected pursuant to the will of Sir William Broke, Lord Cobham,\r\nwho devised “all those edifices, ruined buildings, soil and ground,\r\nwith the appurtenances which some time belonged to the late suppressed\r\ncollege for the use of the ‘new’ college.” By an act of the 39th of\r\nElizabeth, the wardens of Rochester Bridge for the time being were made\r\na body corporate, and declared perpetual presidents of the new college,\r\nthe government of which they retain to this day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The College._]\r\n\r\nThe dependent village of Cobham is one of the neatest and most\r\npleasant of the fair villages of Kent. There are, no doubt, many\r\nnobler and more perfect examples of the domestic architecture of “old”\r\nEngland than is supplied by Cobham Hall, but it would be difficult to\r\ndirect attention to any that affords so rich a recompense at so small\r\na cost; taking into account its genuine remains of antiquity, the\r\nmagnificent works of Art that decorate its walls, its easy access from\r\nthe metropolis, and the primitive character and surpassing beauty of\r\nthe locality in which it is situated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMOUNT EDGCUMBE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWE cannot say in what month these details will be read, but they are\r\nwritten on a morning of May, in one of the loveliest spots of the\r\nfairest of our English shires: a mild and genial day of mid-spring—\r\n\r\n  “The soote season that bud and blome forth brings;”\r\n\r\nwhen the apple orchards—prides of Devon—are in full blossom; the\r\nhawthorns have donned their snow-white draperies; the gorse its garment\r\nof gold; and every hedgerow is rich in the hundred hues of flowers\r\nthat herald summer: while all the hill-slopes and meadows, “in verdure\r\nclad,” seem rejoicing over the prospective abundance that Nature\r\npromises to healthy toil. We have passed through the fifty-three miles\r\nthat separate Exeter from Plymouth. It would be hard to find in any\r\npart of the world, in equal space, a road so lavishly endowed with\r\ngifts of the fertile and the beautiful. Part of the way by the open\r\nsea, then by estuaries, then by the banks of broad rivers, then by\r\nnarrow and rapid streams, then under the shadows of tree-clad hills,\r\ngreen from base to summit, with frequent views of prosperous towns and\r\nhappy villages, with venerable churches continually showing their tall\r\nspires above the tree-tops—in thoroughly rural England, far from the\r\ntall chimneys and dense atmosphere that betoken manufactures and their\r\nresults—the railway runs through many scenes of surpassing loveliness,\r\nany one of which might tempt the traveller who is in search of either\r\nhealth or pleasure, with assurance of an ample supply of both.\r\n\r\nThe GREAT WESTERN conveys us from Paddington to Exeter. We leave\r\nExeter by the South Devon Railway (proverbially well managed, in\r\nall respects): it may take us to Penzance; but its great station is\r\nmidway, at Plymouth, where has been recently erected for the especial\r\naccommodation of railway travellers and tourists, an admirable\r\nhotel (the Duke of Cornwall—there is none more comfortable in the\r\nkingdom).[11] Here we arrest the tourist, in order to visit the\r\npromontory of Mount Edgcumbe, that occupies one side of the famous\r\nharbour.\r\n\r\nFirst, however, let us glance at the several points of interest that\r\nclaim our attention _en route_. Leaving Exeter and its many attractions\r\nother than its renowned Cathedral, we first reach the marine village of\r\nStarcross, opposite to which are old Topsham (full of memories of our\r\nown boyhood, when “a stranger yet to pain”), and young Exmouth; stately\r\nvillas and pretty cottages occupy slopes of the hill range. Then, at\r\nDawlish, a graceful village, we front the sea, and pass some singular\r\nrocks of red sandstone, that stand like sentinels along the shore—and\r\nhere, it may be well to note, some extraordinary inroads upon the\r\nsea-wall of the railway have lately been made by the ocean—Teignmouth\r\nand Shaldon come next, towns on both sides of the river Teign,\r\nconnected by a narrow wooden bridge more than a quarter of a mile in\r\nlength. We next arrive at Newton Junction, where a railway branch\r\nconducts to Torquay and Dartmouth; soon afterwards Totnes is reached,\r\nan old town on the Dart, one of the most beautiful of all the rivers in\r\nDevonshire, whence a steamboat issues daily to visit Dartmouth. Here\r\nwe have left the sea, and have only in view rich pasture land—ever\r\ngreen, the hills tree-clad to their topmost heights. Passing Brent and\r\nKingsbridge Stations, Ivy Bridge next comes in sight, a deep dell, over\r\nwhich a viaduct passes: a dell of singular beauty, one of the finest in\r\nall Devonshire. Soon we pass Cornwood and Plympton,—the latter famous\r\nas the birthplace of Sir Joshua Reynolds,—and, skirting the Plym,\r\nenter Plymouth.\r\n\r\nThe eye is at once arrested by a sylvan spot, running out into the sea,\r\nbeyond the docks, and their manifold adjuncts; a mass of greenery,\r\nunbroken except by trees of varied foliage, that rise continually in\r\ngroups, from all parts of the promontory that, thus seen, seems an\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nThe admiral of the “Invincible” Armada had taste, at least, in fixing\r\nupon Mount Edgcumbe as his dwelling-place, when settled in the country\r\nhe was “about” to conquer. God’s providence gave the invader a\r\ndifferent locality; and the beautiful domain continues to be, as it was\r\nthen, the home of the family of the Edgcumbes, now earls of “that ilk.”\r\n\r\nMount Edgcumbe is in Cornwall; but until recently it was a part of\r\nDevonshire; the Act of Parliament that removed it from one county to\r\nthe other dating no further back than 1854. But Acts of Parliament have\r\ndone other wonders in this district, for it was only in 1824 that an\r\nact was passed giving to the town of “Plymouth Dock,”—or, as it was\r\nthen generally called, “Dock,”—the new and more pretentious name which\r\nit now holds of _Devonport_. The “Mount” is about half a mile across\r\nthe bay which divides it from the now “united” towns of Devonport,\r\nStonehouse, and Plymouth, which, together, contain a population of\r\n150,000 “souls.” From any of the adjacent heights, especially the Hoe\r\nat Plymouth, we obtain a glorious view of the road-stead—fortified\r\neverywhere. In mid-distance is seen the Breakwater, one of the\r\nmarvels of engineering art; and far off, yet within view, the famous\r\nlighthouse—the Eddystone, some fourteen miles from the nearest shore.\r\nBetween these objects and the port are, at all times, many ships of the\r\nnavy: they rule the waves of ocean in the seas that encircle earth;\r\nand Plymouth will be especially glorified when the triumphs of British\r\nsailors, from the admiral to the able seaman, supply subjects of\r\ndiscourse.\r\n\r\nThe Breakwater, one of the most gigantic works in the kingdom, lies in\r\nPlymouth Sound, where it forms a line between Bovisand Bay on the east,\r\nand Cawsand Bay on the west. It is about three miles from Plymouth,\r\nand is a mile in length. In form it is a straight line, with a kant or\r\narm at each end, branching off towards the shore. At its eastern end\r\na clear passage between it and the Bovisand shore of about a mile in\r\nwidth is left for ships, while at the western end the passage is about\r\na mile and a half in width. The idea of the Breakwater originated with\r\nEarl St. Vincent in 1806, and Mr. Rennie and Mr. Whidbey surveyed the\r\nSound for the purpose. In 1811 the plan was decided upon. The first\r\nstone was deposited on the birthday of the Prince Regent (afterwards\r\nGeorge IV.), 1812. In 1817, and again in 1824, much damage was done\r\nto the progressing work. The quantity of stone used in its formation\r\nis estimated at about four millions of tons, exclusive of about\r\ntwo millions and a half of tons of granite and other stones used\r\nfor paving, facings, &c. At the east end is a beacon, and at the\r\nwest end a lighthouse 60 feet high. The spirited engraving of this\r\ngigantic undertaking, which we here give, is taken from Mr. Jewitt’s\r\nrecently published “History of Plymouth,” where it forms one of many\r\nillustrations. The view, as will be seen, is a kind of bird’s-eye, and\r\nshows the form of the Breakwater, with its new central fort and its\r\nlighthouse and beacon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Plymouth Breakwater._]\r\n\r\nThe Eddystone Lighthouse, in the English Channel, is fourteen miles\r\nfrom Plymouth, from which town its light is distinctly visible under\r\nfavourable atmospheric circumstances. It is erected on one of the\r\nEddystone rocks, probably so called from the eddies, or whirls, which\r\nsurround them. The rocks themselves are completely covered at high\r\ntide. The first attempt to erect a lighthouse on these rocks was made\r\nby Mr. Winstanley in 1696. This was completed in about four years,\r\nbut was washed away in a hurricane. In 1706 a new lighthouse, for\r\nwhich an Act of Parliament had been passed, was begun to be erected\r\nby Mr. John Rudyerd, silk mercer, of London, who was of the famous\r\nfamily of Rudyerd, of Rudyerd, in the county of Stafford, and a man\r\nof considerable engineering and architectural skill. He, wishing to\r\nprofit by experience, determined that as the former lighthouse had\r\nbeen angular, his should be round, and that as it was mainly of stone\r\nhis should be of wood. In 1709 Rudyerd’s lighthouse was completed, and\r\ngave promise of being a great success. Years passed on, storms rose,\r\nthe waves dashed over and around it wildly, but it remained firm and\r\nunshaken even through the dreadful tempest of 1744. What wind and\r\nwater could not do, was, however, soon after fearfully accomplished\r\nby fire—the lighthouse being burned down in 1755. Immediately after\r\nthis Mr. Smeaton undertook the task of erecting a new lighthouse\r\nof stone. This, the present Eddystone Lighthouse, was commenced in\r\n1756 and completed in 1759. In construction it is the most complete\r\nexample of architectural and engineering skill. The lower part is\r\nsolid throughout, being literally as firm as the rock itself, on which\r\nit is immovably and permanently fixed. The stones are all dovetailed\r\ntogether, so that, in reality, it becomes but one stone throughout. In\r\nthe upper portion, which is equally strong, the rooms and staircase\r\ntake up the hollow centre. The lantern is octagonal. This building,\r\nwhich has given to the name of Smeaton an imperishable fame, bears on\r\nits granite cornice the truly appropriate inscription:—“Except the\r\nLord build the house, they labour in vain that build it. Psalm cxxvii.\r\n1;” and over the lantern, “24th August, 1759. Laus Deo.” Of this we\r\ngive an engraving on our initial letter on page 54.\r\n\r\nBut we have a theme that demands all the space we can give—MOUNT\r\nEDGCUMBE, and that other seat of the ancient family, COTHELE.\r\n\r\nFor Mount Edgcumbe art has done little; but it was here unnecessary\r\nfor art to do much: like some women, whose charms of expression and\r\nperfect “loveliness” do not seem to require beauty, this delicious\r\npeninsula has been so richly gifted by Nature, that, perhaps, efforts\r\nto enhance its attractions might have lessened instead of augmenting\r\nthem. Hill and dell, heights and hollows, pasture slopes and rugged\r\nhillocks, succeed each other with a delicious harmony we have rarely\r\nseen elsewhere. On one side of the bay are the three busy towns,\r\nactive with energetic life; on another are the cultivated hill-sides\r\nof productive Devon; on another is the open sea, with the two objects\r\nwe have noted—the Breakwater and the marvellous Eddystone. Everywhere\r\nNature has had its own sweet will; even the laurel hedges have risen\r\nthirty feet in height; the lime trees grow as if they had never been\r\ntrimmed; while the slopes, from the hill-heights to the sea-rocks,\r\nappear as sheen as if the scythe had been perpetually smoothing them.\r\nHere and there, pretty and pleasant shelters have been provided for\r\nvisitors who throng hither for health and relaxation;[12] “look\r\nout” seats are provided on many of the hill-tops; and the deer and\r\nthe rabbits have free pasturage in the noble Park that occupies a\r\nspace of many hundred acres between the harbour and the sea. Nor may\r\nwe forget the “defences” of the peninsula: the battery that would\r\nhere, as elsewhere, “keep the foreigner from fooling us,” and that\r\nbattery called “the Salute,” in which the huge “Armstrongs” are\r\nhidden, but where may be seen, by all on-lookers, twenty-one mounted\r\ncannon—“prizes” from ships of “the enemy” taken during the war with\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Mount Edgcumbe, from Stonehouse Pier._]\r\n\r\nAll, therefore, is not left to Nature. Nor must we forget the gardens:\r\nprettily laid out; enriched by rare trees, with vases and statues\r\njudiciously intermixed; and, especially, a grove of orange trees, with\r\nseveral summer-houses in pleasant nooks, where cedars, magnolias, cork\r\ntrees, and other trees, supply shade and shelter from rain and sun.\r\nArt has here been aiding Nature, but its influence is felt rather than\r\nseen; those to whom the “grounds” owe much seem to have been ever\r\nmindful that their profuse and natural luxuriance needed few checks\r\nof the pruner and trainer. The name of one of these benefactors is\r\nrecorded—a votive urn contains a tablet to the memory of that countess\r\n“whose taste embellished these retreats, herself their brightest\r\nornament”—Countess Sophia, who could not have found on earth a home\r\nmore lovely than that which, in 1806, she was called to leave for one\r\nstill more perfect and more beautiful.\r\n\r\nThe great charm of Mount Edgcumbe, however, consists in the five-mile\r\ndrive through the Park, along a road that everywhere skirts the harbour\r\nor the sea. It is perpetual hill and dell; a mimic ruin, intended\r\nas a view tower, and answering its purpose well, is the only object\r\nremarkable on the higher grounds, if we except the church—Maker\r\nChurch—neither venerable nor picturesque, but containing many\r\ninteresting memorials of the Edgcumbe family;[13] but down in the dales\r\n(in nearly all of them) are the pretty “lodges,” where the keepers and\r\ngardeners reside, and where simple “refreshments” of milk and hot water\r\nare provided for the crowds who are weekly visitors to the domain. One\r\nof these we have pictured on page 64.\r\n\r\nLady Emma’s cottage—Lady Emma being the first Countess of Mount\r\nEdgcumbe, wife of George, first Baron and Earl of that title—is\r\ncharmingly situated in one of the most lovely of the dells of this\r\ndomain, surrounded by soft grassy turf, and overhung by lofty trees;\r\nthe cottage itself is completely embosomed in creeping plants, and\r\nhas a rustic verandah exquisitely decorated with fir-cones and other\r\nnatural productions, so disposed as to give considerable richness to\r\nthe effect of the building. The little valley in which it stands,\r\nhollowed out with great regularity by Nature, and sloping gently down\r\ntowards the sea, is one of the sweetest spots on the whole estate. The\r\nfootway winds round the upper part of the valley, and at the head of\r\nthe dell is a spacious alcove composed of Gothic fragments, called the\r\n“Ruined Chapel,” from which a glorious view is obtained.\r\n\r\nIn the grounds the most famous points for the attraction of visitors\r\nare “Thomson’s Seat;” the “Temple of Milton;” a recess called the\r\n“Amphitheatre;” a charming alcove, the “White Seat,” which commands\r\na splendid prospect; “the Arch,” which overlooks the Sound; and the\r\n“zig-zag walks,” which lead down along the cliffs and through the\r\nwoods, and are the favourite resorts of visitors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Mansion._]\r\n\r\nThe gardens are three in number, and called respectively the “Italian,”\r\nthe “French,” and the “English” gardens, in each of which the special\r\ncharacteristics of planting and arrangement of those countries are\r\ncarried out—the conservatories, fountains, orangeries, terraces, etc.,\r\nbeing, in each instance, built in accordance with the tastes of the\r\nthree kingdoms.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it is difficult to convey an idea of the grandeur, beauty,\r\nand interest of the views from every portion of the Park; they are\r\nperpetually varied as the eye turns from sea to shore, and from shore\r\nto sea; each one of them enhanced by ships at anchor or in full sail;\r\nwhile boats of all forms and sizes are continually passing to and fro.\r\nOne of the most prominent objects from the park is Drake’s Island; an\r\nisland in mid-channel between Plymouth and Mount Edgcumbe; it appears\r\non the map, however, as St. Nicholas Island, its original name, but it\r\nhas, in later times, been occasionally called Drake’s Island, after\r\nthe great admiral, Sir Francis Drake—one of the many sea-heroes of\r\nwhom Plymouth is justly proud. This island is connected with the shore\r\nat Mount Edgcumbe by a submarine ridge of rocks, called the “Bridge,”\r\nwhich renders the passage, on that side, dangerous to ships of even\r\nmoderate burthen. On the island was formerly an ancient chapel,\r\ndedicated to St. Michael, which was converted in the fifteenth century\r\ninto a bulwark. The island contains about three acres of land, and is\r\nstrongly fortified.\r\n\r\nWe turn our backs on the Breakwater and distant Eddystone, to mark the\r\nsteamer passing under the most remarkable effort of engineering skill\r\nin England—one of the legacies of Brunel—the “Albert Bridge” that\r\ncrosses the Tamar from Devonshire into Cornwall; and long to visit\r\n(which we may easily do, for steam-boats run daily up it in summer)\r\nthe beautiful river Tamar and its grand tributary, the Tavy. A drive\r\nof a mile, and before us is a continuation of the promontory, still\r\ncharming; and a little farther on, but across the river Lynher—and\r\nadjacent to the ancient borough of St. Germans, with its venerable\r\nchurch, once the cathedral of the See of Cornwall—is Port Eliot, the\r\nresidence of the noble family of Eliot, Earls of St. Germans. In a\r\nword, a hundred points of deep and exciting interest, picturesquely\r\nbeautiful and historically interesting, may be seen and “taken note\r\nof,” from the several points to which a drive through the Park conducts.\r\n\r\nWe give an engraving of the mansion. Parts of it are as old as the\r\nreign of Henry VIII., but its outward signs of remote age are few; it\r\nseems built for comfort; it is thoroughly a domestic house; the rooms\r\nare neither large, lofty, nor stately; but all of them are made to live\r\nin—so many parts of a home. We may except the Great Hall, however;\r\nthat is “grand.” There is a minstrels’ gallery, and it is often used\r\nfor music. The house is square in general form, and originally had\r\na circular tower at each angle; these, however, have been rebuilt\r\nof an octagonal form, and additions have been carried in different\r\ndirections. The front faces down a grassy slope to the sea at Cremill,\r\nand thus a charming prospect is always before its windows; the rooms\r\nare full of family and historic portraits: some of them by the great\r\nold masters, many by Sir Joshua Reynolds, “dear Knight of Plympton,”\r\nwhile ten or twelve Vanderveldes grace the several apartments. Of\r\nthese some are stated to have been painted by the artist, Vandervelde\r\nhimself, at Mount Edgcumbe. Of one, which formed the subject of\r\ncorrespondence between Sir Richard Edgcumbe and the artist, the\r\noriginal and amended sketches hang beside the picture. The portraits\r\nby Sir Joshua Reynolds are of individuals of three generations, and\r\nthose by Lely are in his best style. Among the national pictures are\r\nfull-length and other portraits of Charles I., Charles II., James II.,\r\nPrince Rupert, William III., the Duke of Monmouth, and others.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to add that delicious views are obtained from the\r\nwindows of all the leading chambers, not only on the upper but on\r\nthe ground floors, as well as from the several terraces by which the\r\ndwelling is, on all sides, environed—occupying as it does an elevation\r\non the side of one of the hill slopes.\r\n\r\nBefore we visit COTHELE—the other mansion of the Mount-Edgcumbes—we\r\ngive some account of the ancient and long-honoured family, who have\r\nbeen their lords for many hundred years.\r\n\r\nThe family of Edgcumbe, or Edgcomb, is one of the most ancient and\r\nvenerable in the county of Devon, the name being derived from their\r\noriginal possession of Eggescomb, Egecomb, or Edgcombe (now called\r\nLower Edgcumbe), in the parish of Milton Abbots, in that county. From\r\nthis family and this place, the noble family of the Earls of Mount\r\nEdgcumbe is descended as a younger branch.\r\n\r\nIn 1292 Richard Edgcumbe was Lord of Edgcumbe, in Milton Abbots, and\r\nhe was direct ancestor, both of the present representative of the main\r\nline, who is twentieth in direct lineal descent, and of the present\r\nennobled family, as well as of the branches settled in Kent and\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Edward III., William de Eggescombe, or Edgcombe, second\r\nson of the House of Edgcumbe, having married Hilaria, sole daughter and\r\nheiress of William de Cothele, of Cothele, or Coteel, in the parish\r\nof Calstock, in Cornwall, a fine old Cornish family, became possessed\r\nof Cothele and the other estates, and removed into Cornwall. Here, at\r\nCothele, he and his descendants resided for several generations.\r\n\r\nRichard Edgcumbe, great grandson of William de Edgcumbe and Hilaria\r\nde Cothele, is said to have built the greater part of the grand\r\nold residence of Cothele as it remains at the present day: of this\r\nsingular mansion we shall furnish some details. At Bosworth Richard\r\nEdgcumbe received the honour of knighthood from his victorious\r\nleader, Henry VII., was made comptroller of his household, and one\r\nof his Privy Council, and had the castle and lordship of Totnes, in\r\nDevonshire—forfeited to the crown on the attainder of John Lord Zouch\r\nfor high treason—conferred upon him by that monarch, with many other\r\nhonours and dignities, and large extents of land, including those of\r\nSir Henry Bodrugan, who had likewise been attainted for high treason.\r\nHe also held, as he had previously done, the offices of Recorder, and\r\nConstable of the castle of Launceston, and Constable of Hertford, &c.\r\nIn 1488 Sir Richard was sent into Ireland, as Lord Deputy, by his royal\r\nmaster, to take the oaths of allegiance of the Irish people, embarking\r\nat Mounts Bay in the _Anne of Fowey_, and attended by other ships,\r\nand a retinue of five hundred men. He died in 1489, at Morlaix, while\r\nholding the appointment of ambassador to France. He married Joan,\r\ndaughter of Thomas Tremaine of Collacombe, by whom he had issue.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Lady Emma’s Cottage._]\r\n\r\nOf Sir Richard Edgcumbe, Fuller tells a romantic story. He says he was\r\n“memorable in his generation for being zealous in the cause of Henry,\r\nEarl of Richmond, afterwards King Henry VII. He was, in the time of\r\nRichard III., so hotly pursued, and narrowly searched for, that he\r\nwas forced to hide himself in his wood, at his house, in Cuttail, in\r\nCornwall. Here extremity taught him a suddain policy, to put a stone\r\nin his capp and tumble the same into the water, whilst these rangers\r\nwere fast at his heels, who, looking down after the noise, and seeing\r\nthe cap swimming therein, supposed that hee had desperately drowned\r\nhimself, and deluded by this honest fraud, gave over their further\r\npursuit, leaving him at liberty to shift over into Brittany. Nor was\r\nhis gratitude less than his ingenuity, who, in remembranse of his\r\ndelivery, after his return built a chappel (which still remains) in\r\nthe plase where he lurked, and lived in great repute with prince and\r\npeople.” After thus cleverly misleading his pursuers, Richard Edgcumbe\r\ncrossed the Channel in a small ship, to the Earl of Richmond, in\r\nBrittany, with whom he afterwards returned to England, and was engaged\r\nin the battle of Bosworth Field, in Leicestershire, where King Richard\r\nwas killed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _In the Gardens._]\r\n\r\nHis son, Piers Edgcumbe, was Sheriff of the county of Devon, 9th, 10th,\r\nand 13th Henry VII. and 2nd Henry VIII. “At the creation of Prince\r\nArthur he was one of the twenty individuals who were made Knights of\r\nthe Cross of St. Andrew.” He, with others, was “appointed to review\r\nand array all men at arms, archers, and others, who were to accompany\r\nSir Thomas D’Arcy in his expedition against the Moors and infidels.”\r\nHe was one of the expedition into France, 5th Henry VIII., and for\r\nhis distinguished gallantry at the sieges of Tournay and Thurovenne,\r\nand at the battle of Spurs, he was created a knight-banneret. Sir\r\nPiers Edgcumbe was married twice: first to the daughter and heiress\r\nof Stephen Durnford, by his wife the heiress of Rame; and, second, to\r\nKatherine, daughter of Sir John St. John, and widow of Sir Griffith\r\nAp Rys, by whom he had no issue. By the first of these marriages,\r\nSir Piers Edgcumbe acquired the manors and estates of the Durnfords,\r\nincluding that of West Stonehouse (now Mount Edgcumbe). He had issue\r\nby her, three sons, Richard, John, and James, and three daughters,\r\nElizabeth, Jane, and Agnes (or Anne). Sir Piers Edgcumbe died in 1539,\r\nand was succeeded as heir by his eldest son, Richard Edgcumbe, who was\r\nknighted in 1536.\r\n\r\nThis Sir Richard Edgcumbe built the present family mansion, on a\r\npart of the estate which his father had acquired by marriage with\r\nthe heiress of the Durnfords (who had inherited it from the ancient\r\nfamily of Stonehouse or Stenhouse), and gave to it the name of “Mount\r\nEdgcumbe.” He was Sheriff of Devon 35th Henry VIII. and 1st Queen\r\nMary. He married first a daughter of Sir John Arundel, by whom he had\r\nno issue; and, second, Winifred Essex, and by her had, besides other\r\nissue, a son, Piers, or Peter, who succeeded him. Sir Richard Edgcumbe,\r\nwho kept up a fine establishment, and at one time entertained at Mount\r\nEdgcumbe the English, Spanish, and Netherlands admirals, died in 1561.\r\nPiers (or Peter) Edgcumbe, who was member of Parliament, and was also\r\nSheriff of Devon 9th Elizabeth, married Margaret, daughter of Sir\r\nAndrew Lutterell, by whom he had five sons and four daughters, and was\r\nsucceeded by his eldest son, Richard.\r\n\r\nPiers Edgcumbe died in 1607, and on his tomb his honours are thus set\r\nforth:—\r\n\r\n  “Lief Tenant to my Queen long Time\r\n  And often for my Shire and Knighte;\r\n  My merit did to Creddit clime,\r\n  Still bidinge in my Callinge righte;\r\n  By Loyalty my faith was tryede,\r\n  Peacefull I liv’d, hopeful I diede.”\r\n\r\nHis son, Sir Richard Edgcumbe, knighted by James I., was member of\r\nParliament for Totnes, for Grampound, and for Bossiney; he married\r\nMary, daughter and heiress of Sir Richard Coteele, or Cottle, of\r\nLondon, and by her, who died eighteen years before him, had issue, two\r\nsons, Piers and Richard, by the eldest of whom, Piers Edgcumbe, he was\r\nsucceeded. This gentleman distinguished himself by his devotion to the\r\nroyal cause; he “was a master of languages and sciences, a lover of the\r\nking and church, which he endeavoured to support in the time of the\r\ncivil wars to the utmost of his power and fortune.” Sir Alexander Carew\r\nand Major Scawen, for holding connection with Piers Edgcumbe, who held\r\na colonel’s commission in the king’s army, were beheaded. He married\r\nMary, daughter of Sir John Glanvil, and died in 1660, being succeeded\r\nby his eldest son, Sir Richard Edgcumbe, who had been knighted during\r\nhis father’s lifetime. He was also a member of Parliament. He married\r\nAnne Montague, daughter of Edward, Earl of Sandwich, by whom he had\r\nissue two sons, Piers, who died young and unmarried, and Richard; and\r\nsix daughters. He died in 1688.\r\n\r\nTo this time, for several generations, it will have been noticed, the\r\ninheritors of the estate alternated, in name, between Piers (or Peter)\r\nand Richard. This succession of name was now broken by the death of\r\nPiers, the eldest son.\r\n\r\nRichard Edgcumbe, soon after coming of age, was chosen M.P. for\r\nCornwall, and continued to sit for various places until 1742. In 1716\r\nand 1720 he was one of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, and\r\nin 1724 was Vice-Treasurer, and Paymaster of the Taxes, &c. In 1742\r\nhe was created BARON EDGCUMBE of Mount Edgcumbe, and was afterwards\r\nmade Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, one of the Privy Council,\r\nand Lord-Lieutenant of Cornwall. His lordship, by his wife Matilda,\r\ndaughter of Sir Henry Furnese, had issue, three sons, Richard, Henry\r\n(who died an infant), and George; he died in 1758, and was succeeded\r\nin his title and estates by his eldest son, Richard, second Baron\r\nEdgcumbe, member of Parliament for various places, one of the Lords of\r\nthe Admiralty, and afterwards appointed Comptroller of his Majesty’s\r\nHousehold. He was a man of great talent, and is thus spoken of by\r\nHorace Walpole in his “Royal and Noble Authors:”—“His lordship’s skill\r\nas a draughtsman is said to have been such as might entitle him to\r\na place in the ‘Anecdotes of English Painting,’ ‘while the ease and\r\nharmony of his poetic compositions give him an authorised introduction\r\nhere.’ ... ‘a man of fine parts, great knowledge, and original wit,\r\nwho possessed a light and easy vein of poetry; who was calculated by\r\nnature to serve the public, and to charm society; but who unhappily\r\nwas a man of pleasure, and left his gay associates a most affecting\r\nexample how health, fame, ambition, and everything that may be laudable\r\nin principle or practice, are drawn into and absorbed by that most\r\ndestructive of all whirlpools—gaming.’”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Ruin, the Sound, Drake’s Island, &c._]\r\n\r\nHis lordship, dying unmarried in 1761, was succeeded by his brother\r\nGeorge as third baron. This nobleman, who had sat in several\r\nparliaments, and held various public offices (among them the\r\nLord-Lieutenancy of Cornwall), and was Vice-Admiral of the Blue,\r\nmarried Emma, only daughter and heiress of John Gilbert, Archbishop of\r\nYork, by whom he had issue an only son, who succeeded him. His lordship\r\nwas, on the 17th February, 1781, created in addition to his title of\r\nBaron Edgcumbe, _Viscount Mount Edgcumbe and Valletort_; and in 1789 he\r\nwas further advanced to the dignity of an earl, by the title of _Earl\r\nof Mount Edgcumbe_. Dying in 1795, he was succeeded by his only son,\r\nRichard, as second earl.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Salute Battery._]\r\n\r\nThis nobleman, who also held the office of Lord-Lieutenant of\r\nCornwall, married Lady Sophia Hobart, daughter of John, second Earl of\r\nBuckinghamshire, and by her had issue, two sons, Ernest Augustus, and\r\nGeorge, and two daughters. His lordship died in 1839, and was succeeded\r\nby his eldest son, Ernest Augustus, as third earl, who (born in 1797)\r\nwas Aide-de-Camp to the Queen and Colonel of the Cornwall militia.\r\nHe married, in 1831, Caroline Augusta, daughter of Rear-Admiral\r\nCharles Feilding, who still survives him, and is an extra Lady of the\r\nBed-chamber to the Queen. By her his lordship had issue two sons: viz.,\r\nWilliam Henry and Charles Ernest, and two daughters, of whom Ernestine\r\nEmma Horatia is still living. The earl died in 1861, and was succeeded\r\nby his eldest son as fourth earl.\r\n\r\nThe present nobleman, William Henry Edgcumbe, fourth Earl of Mount\r\nEdgcumbe, Viscount Mount Edgcumbe and Valletort, and Baron Edgcumbe\r\nof Mount Edgcumbe, the noble owner of Mount Edgcumbe and of the large\r\nestates concentrated in the family, was born in 1832. He was educated\r\nat Harrow, and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he became B.A. in 1856,\r\nand sat as M.P. for the borough of Plymouth from 1859 to 1861, when,\r\nby the death of his father, he entered the Upper House. His lordship\r\nis an extra Lord of the Bed-chamber to H.R.H. the Prince of Wales; is\r\nLieutenant-Colonel of the 2nd battalion and Captain Commandant of the\r\n16th corps of Devon Rifle Volunteers; is a Special Deputy Warden of the\r\nStannaries, &c., &c. He married in 1858 the Lady Katherine Elizabeth\r\nHamilton, fourth daughter of the first Duke of Abercorn, and has by her\r\nissue one son, Piers Alexander Hamilton Edgcumbe Viscount Valletort\r\n(born 1865), and three daughters, Victoria Frederica Caroline, born\r\n1859, Albertha Louisa Florence, born 1861, and Edith Hilaria, born\r\n1862. His lordship is patron of five livings; viz., Dittisham and\r\nBeer Ferrers, in Devonshire; and Landrake, Rame, and Millbrook, in\r\nCornwall. The arms of the Earl of Mount Edgcumbe are—_gules_, on a\r\nbend _ermines_, cottised, _or_, three boars’ heads, _argent_. Crest—a\r\nboar, statant, _argent_, gorged with a leaf of oak, _vert_, fructed,\r\n_or_. Supporters—two greyhounds, _argent_, gutté de poix, and gorged\r\nwith a collar, dovetailed, _gules_.\r\n\r\nFrom the ancient mansion at Mount Edgcumbe we proceed to that which is\r\nstill older and more venerable—\r\n\r\nCOTHELE.—It is difficult to imagine a house continuing—and but\r\nlittle changed—to be inhabited by the same family, or, indeed,\r\ninhabited at all, during a period approaching three centuries; yet\r\nthat is the case with Cothele, pride of the beautiful river Tamar, and\r\none of the “gems” of Cornwall;[14] its gigantic oaks, and chestnuts\r\nare obviously so old; but it is requisite to examine the exterior,\r\nand especially the interior, to obtain conviction that the mansion\r\ndates from the reign of the seventh Henry; while its present lord is\r\nthe lineal representative of the knight who built it—Sir Richard\r\nEdgcumbe—whose house it is we see, nearly as he left it:[15] but,\r\nalso, we may examine the armour he wore, for it still hangs in this\r\nhall; the table at which he feasted (the worm of time only has touched\r\nit); the chairs on which he and his dame sat, the very bed on which\r\nthey slept, while the tapestry, woven by fair hands that have been\r\ndust for three centuries, still cover the old walls. Charles I.\r\ncertainly slept in one of these rooms, and it demands no great stretch\r\nof imagination to believe that the illustrious Sir Walter Raleigh was\r\noften its honoured guest. We may have been seated in the very chair\r\nin which the great knight recounted his adventurous exploits against\r\nthe hated Spaniards under his cousin’s roof-tree. Memories haunt every\r\nroom; every hole and corner, so to speak, has a tale to tell of the\r\nlong past.\r\n\r\nThe house is one of the finest remaining examples of the period to\r\nwhich it belongs, and, with Haddon Hall, in Derbyshire, which it\r\nclosely resembles in general plan and in some of its details, is one\r\nof the best existing specimens of mediæval domestic architecture in\r\nEngland. Although, doubtless, the greater part of the building was\r\nerected by Sir Richard Edgcumbe, it is evident that the whole was\r\nnot built by him, but that he added to, and enlarged the then family\r\nresidence of the Cotheles, many portions of which exist at the present\r\ntime.[16] The buildings surround two court-yards, or quadrangles, the\r\nentrance being surmounted by an embattled tower; the main buildings and\r\nlarge tower are also embattled.\r\n\r\nThe banqueting-hall is a noble apartment, 42 feet long by 22 feet wide.\r\nIt has a remarkably fine timber roof, with intersecting arches in its\r\ncompartments. At the upper end, to the left, the lord’s table stood\r\nbeneath the bayed window, and opposite to it a doorway leads to the\r\nprincipal staircase. At the bottom of the hall are three doorways, one\r\nof which led to the great kitchen, and the other two to the buttery and\r\nthe cellar. On the walls are suits of armour, helmets, breastplates,\r\nwarders’ horns, gauntlets, matchlocks, cross-bows, shields,\r\nbattle-axes, halberts, pikes, swords, pistols, gisarmes, petronels, and\r\ntwo-handed swords and spears that may have been\r\n\r\n        “Bathed in gore\r\n  On the plains of Azincourt.”\r\n\r\nIn the windows are the royal arms, the arms and impalements of\r\nEdgcumbe, Cothele, Holland, Tremaine, Trenchard, Durnford, Rame,\r\nCotterell, Raleigh (for Sir Walter Raleigh’s grandmother was Elizabeth,\r\ndaughter of Sir Richard Edgcumbe of Cothele), Trevanion (Sir William\r\nTrevanion married another daughter of Sir Richard Edgcumbe, and fought\r\nby his side at Bosworth Field, and accompanied him in his pursuit of\r\nthe mutual enemy, Sir Henry Bodrugan), Carew, of Anthony (of the family\r\nof Carew the historian), St. Maur, Courtenay, Bigbury, Fitzwalter, &c.\r\n\r\nThe dining-room is a charming tapestried apartment, with mullioned\r\nwindows and a fine old fire-place. The tapestry is highly interesting,\r\none of the subjects being the story of Eurydice, another Diana and\r\nApollo, and the others rural scenes, equestrian figures, &c.\r\n\r\nAdjoining the dining-room is an ante-room of surpassing interest. “The\r\ntapestry in this room represents the Sciences, and might be called the\r\nschool of Athens, from the similarity of the subject to the celebrated\r\npicture of Raphael.” In this room, as in others, has been collected\r\ntogether a fine assemblage of old earthenware and other interesting\r\nmatters relating to the life of the inmates in times of old.\r\n\r\nThe chapel, which is in the corner of the court-yard, contains a pretty\r\nopen-work oak screen, and an arched roof at the intersections of\r\nwhich are carved bosses. The bowl of the original font is preserved.\r\nIn the east window, in stained glass, are considerable portions of\r\nfull-length figures, probably of saints, but the names do not appear,\r\nwhile in the upper light is represented the Annunciation. The angel is\r\nred with green wings, and on a label, in black letter, the words “Ave\r\nMaria gracia plena, D̄ns tecum.” The Virgin is on the other side, near\r\na building resembling a church, with a label also, on which once was\r\n“Ecce ancilla D̄ni; fiat ̄mi s̄cdm verbū-tuū.” In the lower compartment\r\nof the window will be noticed three shields of arms: the first being\r\nEdgcumbe, quartering Tremaine (or Trenchard); the second, first, and\r\nfourth Edgcumbe, second Holland, third Tremaine, impaling first and\r\nfourth Durnford, second Fitzwalter, and third, now blank but probably\r\noriginally containing Bigbury; and the third which contained Edgcumbe\r\nand several quarterings, much injured. In the south window are two\r\nfemale saints, St. Ann and St. Katherine. “An ancient altar-piece has\r\nthe date 1589, and in the centre the adoration of the Magi; while on\r\none door is the portrait of a man with ‘æt suæ 38,’ and on the other\r\nof a female, with ‘æt suæ 28,’ and on each door a shield with _or_, an\r\narrow, _sable_.” The chapel is entered from the dining-room as well as\r\nfrom the court-yard and domestic offices. It has a small bell turret.\r\n\r\nThe bed-rooms—“the white room,” the “red room,” the “best room,”\r\n“King Charles’s room,” and “Queen Anne’s room”—are all hung with fine\r\ntapestry, and furnished in a style strictly in keeping with the place\r\nitself. The ceiling of the first of these is of geometric design. The\r\ncarved furniture in these rooms is of the most interesting character,\r\nand among the decorations are many shields of arms of the Edgcumbes and\r\ntheir alliances. The tapestry is of the finest character, the furniture\r\ngrand as old furniture well can be, the hangings rich in material\r\nand hoary with age, and the ornaments of the most veritable _vertu_\r\ncharacter—each room in this grand old mansion offers subject-matter\r\nenough for a separate volume.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Mansion._]\r\n\r\nThe drawing-room is also a fine tapestried apartment, furnished with\r\nmassive ebony chairs, ebony sofa, and ebony carved cabinet, and all\r\nthe appliances _en suite_. The kitchen and the other domestic offices\r\nare each and all of the most interesting character, and convey to the\r\nmind a vivid picture of the life of the inmates in days gone by. It\r\nis impossible, indeed, to conceive anything better than Cothele as\r\nan illustration of the home-life of our mediæval ancestors; for the\r\nbuilding, the furniture, and the appliances, as they are to-day, so\r\nwere they three hundred years ago. As it was in the days of Henry VII.,\r\nso it is in those of Queen Victoria; and so, thanks to the preserving\r\nspirit of the Edgcumbes, it is likely to remain for centuries to come.\r\n\r\nOn some of the previous pages mention is made of Sir Richard Edgcumbe’s\r\nescape from his pursuers, and of his founding a chapel on the spot of\r\nhis deliverance. This little chapel still stands to mark the spot,\r\nand to bring back to the mind the circumstances of his escape, and of\r\nthe discomfiture of his pursuers. The chapel is built on the edge of\r\nthe rock overlooking the water, and from the east window the view is\r\nwonderfully grand. In this east window is a figure of St. George in the\r\ncentre, with the Annunciation and the Crucifixion on either side. It\r\nalso bears the arms of Edgcumbe and Tremaine. In the other windows are\r\nalso figures in stained glass, and on the altar is a triptych. Among\r\nother interesting features in this chapel—and they are many—is a\r\nfac-simile of the ancient tomb of Sir Richard Edgcumbe, at Morlaix.\r\n\r\nThe grounds are charmingly wild, yet graceful. Nature is in a great\r\ndegree left to have her own way; the trees are of magnificent size\r\n(one of them indeed measures 28 feet in girth), ferns and wild flowers\r\ngrow in rich luxuriance: every now and then glimpses are obtained of\r\nthe beautiful river, and, on the opposite side, of the hill-steeps and\r\nthick woods of Devonshire. A pretty landing-place for boats is among\r\nthe most picturesque points in the landscape; a lesser river here flows\r\ninto the Tamar; a waterfall adds to the interest of the scene; and a\r\nneat little inn, close to the bank, gives refreshment to the wayfarer;\r\nabove all its attractions is to be counted this—it is distant a dozen\r\nmiles from a railway, and the shrill whistle never breaks the harmony\r\nof the song-birds, who “cannot help but sing” in every bush, brake, and\r\ntree of the demesne. The scenery on the river in the neighbourhood of\r\nCothele is extremely beautiful, and in many places thickly overhung by\r\nskirting woods. Danescombe, a deep hollow in the woods, is a charming\r\nspot, as are the Morwell rocks, and many other places.\r\n\r\nWe have directed attention to but one of a hundred attractions in\r\nDevonshire and Cornwall: Devonshire is rich in the picturesque at\r\nall seasons; and the wild grandeur of the Cornish coast has for\r\ncenturies been a theme of special laudation. Here and there, no doubt,\r\nother countries may supply us with finer examples of the sublime and\r\nbeautiful in scenery; but they are to be reached only by sacrifices,\r\nsuch as the HOME TOURIST is not called upon to make: our own Islands\r\nhave been gifted by God with so much that is refreshing as well as\r\nexciting to the eye and mind, that he or she must be fastidious indeed\r\nwho fails to be content with the beauties that Nature presents so “near\r\nat hand”—accessible at comparatively easy cost of time, toil, and\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Landing Place._]\r\n\r\nBetween Exeter and Plymouth there may be a tour for every day of a\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\nAmong the more delightful trips, where all is so beautiful, and\r\nwhere it is impossible to turn in any direction without finding some\r\ndelightful place or some interesting object, may be named as especially\r\nwithin the reach of visitors, those to Ivy Bridge, with its abundant\r\ncharms of hill, dell, wood, and river; to Saltram, the seat of the\r\nEarl of Morley, on the banks of the Laira; to the Beacon and moors of\r\nBrent; to the picturesque and pleasant dingles and combs of Cornwood;\r\nto Plympton, with its historic sites and its pleasant associations;\r\nto Bickleigh and its poetical vale; to Dartmoor, with its gloomy\r\nwaste, its wild and romantic “breaks” of scenery, and its endless\r\nantiquities; and to scores of other delicious spots. The trip up the\r\nriver Tamar to the Weir-head is one which ought to be taken by every\r\nvisitor, embracing, as it does, besides hundreds of other points of\r\ninterest, the dockyards, gun-wharf, Keyham steam-yard, Mount Edgcumbe,\r\nTorpoint, Thanckes, Gravesend House, the mouth of the sweet river\r\nLynher, by which St. Germans is reached; Saltash, whose women are\r\nproverbial for their dexterity and strength in aquatic exercises, and\r\nwho often carry off regatta prizes; St. Budeaux, with its conspicuous\r\nchurch; the junction of the Tavy with the Tamar; Warleigh, Beer Ferris,\r\nand Maristow; Cargreen and Landulph, in whose churchyard Theodore\r\nPalæologus, the last male descendant of the Christian emperors of\r\nGreece, rests in peace; Pentillie Castle, with its romantic love\r\nstories and tales of change of fortune; Cothele, of which we have\r\nspoken; Calstock, with its fine old church situated on a promontory;\r\nHarewood House, the seat of the Trelawneys, and the scene, in Mason’s\r\n_Elfrida_, of the love of Ethelwold and of the misfortunes consequent\r\non his marriage with the daughter of Ordgar; and the sublime and\r\nbeautiful Morwell Rock.\r\n\r\nStaddon Heights, Mount Batten, Penlee Point, Hooe, and many other\r\nplaces, are within short distances of the Hoe, at Plymouth, and can\r\nbe easily reached. Trematon Castle and St. John’s are also near at\r\nhand, and pleasure trips are frequently made in steam-boats round the\r\nEddystone.\r\n\r\nFor those who make a longer stay in South Devon, visits may well be\r\nmade to Tavistock, to Totnes, to Berry Pomeroy Castle, to Torquay,\r\nwith a long _et cetera_.[17] Besides the trip up the Tamar, there are\r\nother rivers in South Devon whose charms are of a totally different,\r\nbut perhaps even more exquisitely beautiful character. Thus the Dart,\r\nthe Lynher, the Plym, the Yealm, the Erme, and the Tavy, all present\r\nattractions to the tourist.\r\n\r\nIt cannot fail to augment the enjoyment of those who visit this\r\nbeautiful county—the fairest, the brightest, and the “greenest” of all\r\nour English shires—to recall the many “worthies” to whom Devonshire\r\nand Cornwall have given birth; men renowned in art, in science, and in\r\nletters: and the gallant men, the “adventurers,” who carried the flag\r\nof England into every country of the world, braving the battle and the\r\nbreeze in all the seas that surround earth in the four quarters of the\r\nglobe. It is a long list—the names of Drake, of Raleigh, and of Davy;\r\nof Reynolds, Northcote, Haydon, and Eastlake; of Carew, of Hawkins,\r\nand of Gilbert; of Kitto, of Bryant, and of Hawker, being not a tithe\r\nof the eminent men to which this district has given birth—of whom the\r\nwestern shires are rightly and justly proud.\r\n\r\nShame be to those who seek in other lands the enjoyment they may find\r\nso abundantly at home—who talk freely of the graces and grandeurs of\r\nfar-off countries, and do not blush to acknowledge entire ignorance of\r\nthose that bless and beautify their own.\r\n\r\nEngland, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, are, each and all, rich in “the\r\npicturesque;” to the artist and art-lover they present attractions\r\nsecond to none they will find in any country of the Continent: that\r\nis the truest “patriotism,” which inculcates, as a first duty, a full\r\nappreciation of\r\n\r\n  “Our own, our native land!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALNWICK CASTLE.[18]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWITH the single exception of Royal Windsor, ALNWICK CASTLE is second\r\nto none of the mediæval British strongholds which, in our own times,\r\ncombine the characteristics of the early fortress and the modern\r\npalace. With its magnificent architectural features, all of them deeply\r\nimpressed with the attributes of a baronial castle of the olden time,\r\nand placed in the midst of that famous scene of long-continued strife,\r\nof daring deeds, and of summary retribution, the Northern Border,\r\nAlnwick may truly be said to be an historical monument, standing upon\r\nhistoric ground. The names of the great barons, in like manner, who\r\nhave successively been lords of Alnwick, have been enrolled by English\r\nchroniclers among the foremost ranks of their countrymen, so that their\r\nown biographies, interwoven with the history of their renowned castle,\r\nare written in the annals of England. Then, on the other hand, while in\r\nan extraordinary degree rich as well in relics as in memories of the\r\npast, Alnwick still maintains the unclouded splendour of its ancient\r\ndignity in its present capacity as the residence of an existing ducal\r\nfamily. Thus, from whatever point of view it may be regarded, Alnwick\r\nCastle must be esteemed as one of the finest and most interesting of\r\nour national edifices, and it also always will establish its claim to a\r\nforemost place among “the stately homes of England.”\r\n\r\nWhen Nature declined to provide any one of her own emphatic\r\nboundary-lines, such as a mountain-chain or a broad and deep river,\r\nto determine the frontier which should divide England from Scotland,\r\nshe left a very delicate and difficult international question to be\r\nadjusted by the rulers of the two adjacent realms, so long as this\r\nsingle island of Britain should be divided into two distinct, and\r\nby no means necessarily friendly, kingdoms. An artificial line of\r\ndemarcation, accordingly, had to be drawn, and was drawn, which was\r\nsupposed to be accepted and recognised both to the north and to the\r\nsouth of it. Here and there, as if to show in the clearest manner\r\npossible the unsatisfactory character of a frontier such as this, to\r\na tract of country the ominous name of “Debateable Land” was assigned\r\nby common consent. On either side of the frontier-line, again, and\r\nincluding all the “Debateable Land,” the “Border” stretched far away\r\nto both the north and the south; and, throughout its whole extent, it\r\nformed a decidedly exceptional territory, in which there prevailed\r\na system of wild laws that were administered after a still wilder\r\nfashion: hence, whatever may have been the state of things between\r\nEngland and Scotland, and between the two sovereigns and the two\r\nnations, along the Border there flourished a chronic local warfare,\r\nduly distinguished by gallant exploits, desperate enterprises, and\r\nbarbarous devastation, with the occasional variety of an expedition of\r\nsufficient magnitude almost to constitute a regular campaign, or the\r\nformal investment, and perhaps the storm and sack, of some important\r\nfortified castle.[19]\r\n\r\nThe Borderers appear to have become so accustomed to this kind of life,\r\nthat they looked upon it as their proper lot, and after a manner even\r\nregarded it with a kind of grim approval. Among them, doubtless, there\r\nwere but too many who were thoroughly in earnest in their devotion to\r\nwhat may be styled the Border system—men\r\n\r\n  “Stout of heart and steady of hand,”\r\n\r\nwho, living in the constant expectation of some sudden assault, were\r\nboth “good at need,” and ready and resolute at all times to take\r\nadvantage to the utmost of every promising opportunity for successfully\r\nand profitably assaulting their hostile neighbours. In order to keep\r\na check upon this predatory warfare, and to maintain something more\r\nthan the semblance of a supreme constituted authority, certain warlike\r\nbarons, intrusted with high powers as Lords Wardens, were established\r\nin fortified castles of great strength along the line of the Border,\r\nand in those northern districts of England which adjoined it. Of these\r\nearly strongholds one of the proudest and the sternest was the Castle\r\nof Alnwick.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Plan of Alnwick Castle._]\r\n\r\nDistant from London, north by west, 313 miles (by railway), Alnwick,\r\nthe county-town of Northumberland, is pleasantly situated on high\r\nground, rising about 200 feet above the sea-level, on the south bank\r\nof the river Aln. From the name of this river, with the addition of\r\n_wick_, a place of human habitation, ALNWICK, always pronounced by its\r\nnative inhabitants “Annick,” is evidently derived.[20]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Alnwick Castle, from the River Aln._]\r\n\r\nStill remaining but little changed from what it was in times long\r\npassed away, while from the humblest of origins other towns have grown\r\nup and increased until they have attained to great magnitude and\r\nwealth and importance, Alnwick derives its interest from its early\r\nassociation with our national history—an association blended with the\r\nconnection of the town with its castle, and with the great barons, the\r\nlords of that castle. The site of the castle and town of Alnwick is of\r\na character which necessarily leads to the conclusion, that it must\r\nhave been occupied both by a settlement and by some stronghold from a\r\nvery remote period; and this opinion is confirmed by the presence of\r\nnumerous relics in the immediate neighbourhood, that may be assigned\r\nwithout hesitation to ages anterior to the Roman settlement in Britain:\r\nthe authentic history of Alnwick, however, cannot be carried back\r\nfurther than the era of the Norman Conquest, and even then for awhile\r\nmore than a little of uncertainty overshadows the earliest pages of the\r\nchronicle. There exists no evidence to show that in the year 1066 any\r\ncastle was standing at Alnwick; nor have we any knowledge of what lords\r\nmay have held the high ground on the southern bank of the Aln during\r\nthe Anglo-Saxon rule.\r\n\r\nOn Alnwick Moor, and in many places in the neighbourhood, are some\r\nremarkably interesting camps and other earth-works, and also some\r\nbarrows, in which various relics have been discovered. In one of these\r\nwas found a stone cist, containing a skeleton in the usual contracted\r\nposition of Celtic interments; and in another, in a similar cist,\r\nwas found a fine food-vessel, ornamented with a lozenge pattern. In\r\nother barrows Celtic remains, including cinerary urns, drinking-cups,\r\nfood-vessels, flints, celts, and other implements of stone, bronze\r\ndaggers, &c., have been found, and prove incontestably the early\r\noccupation of the site of Alnwick. In the neighbourhood, too, occur\r\nmany of those curious remains of antiquity, sculptured stones, bearing\r\ncircles and other rude and singular characters, which are supposed to\r\nbe inscriptions.\r\n\r\nIt may be accepted as probable that the first Norman by whom this\r\nbarony was held was Gilbert Tyson, standard-bearer of the Conqueror,\r\nthe kind of personage who very naturally would be intrusted with the\r\ncharge of a remote and turbulent northern district. His descendants\r\ncontinued to hold some estates under the lords of Alnwick in the reign\r\nof Edward III., but there is no foundation for the legend that the\r\nbarony of Alnwick passed to Yvo de Vesci by his marriage with Alda,\r\na granddaughter of Gilbert Tyson. Still, by whatever means he may\r\nhave acquired possession, Yvo de Vesci was lord of Alnwick about the\r\nyear 1096; and he also is the first Norman baron of this barony whose\r\nhistory, scanty as it is, rises above doubt and speculation. He died\r\nabout the year 1134, leaving, without any male issue, an only daughter,\r\nBeatrix, his sole heiress.\r\n\r\nBefore we pass on to trace the fortunes of the descendants of Yvo\r\nde Vesci, a brief notice must be taken of a memorable incident which\r\ntook place in the immediate neighbourhood of Alnwick before Yvo\r\nhimself had become its lord. After the Norman Conquest many of the\r\nAnglo-Saxon nobles found a sympathizing refuge to the north of the\r\nBorder, under the protection of Malcolm Caenmore, or “great head,” King\r\nof Scotland, whose queen was an Anglo-Saxon princess, being sister\r\nto Edgar Atheling. Malcolm, in his zeal for the fallen Anglo-Saxon\r\ndynasty, five times made incursions into Northumberland, laid waste\r\nthe country far and wide with fire and sword, and carried away almost\r\nthe entire adult population as slaves into Scotland. This devastating\r\nwarfare was suspended in consequence of a treaty, during the concluding\r\nyears of the reign of the Conqueror; but it broke out afresh after\r\nthe succession of Rufus, and Malcolm, accompanied by Prince William,\r\nhis eldest son, in person led an expedition as far south as Alnwick;\r\nand there, on the 13th of November, 1093, the king himself fell in\r\nan ambuscade, his son at the same time was mortally wounded, and the\r\nScottish army was dispersed by Earl Robert de Mowbray, the governor\r\nof Bamborough Castle. The body of Malcolm, having rested about thirty\r\nyears at Tynemouth, was removed and re-interred at Dunfermline by his\r\nson Alexander. There still remain two fragments of a rude memorial\r\ncross, which, from an early period, has marked the spot assigned by\r\ntradition to the scene of Malcolm’s discomfiture and death; and, in\r\n1774, one of his descendants, Elizabeth, Duchess of Northumberland,\r\nerected on the same spot another cross, designed in accordance with the\r\ndebased architectural taste of that period.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Barbican._]\r\n\r\nThe one circumstance connected with the career of Yvo de Vesci that\r\nhas come down to us is the fact that he began to build the earliest\r\nparts of the existing castle of Alnwick. With the barony, the castle\r\nof Alnwick passed to Eustace Fitz-John by his marriage with Beatrix,\r\nthe heiress of Yvo de Vesci. In the hands of this able baron, Alnwick\r\nCastle was “most strongly fortified:” he also founded the monastery of\r\nAlnwick, and in 1157 was succeeded by his eldest son, William, who, in\r\nhonour of his mother, assumed the name of De Vesci. In the time of this\r\nbaron, another King of Scotland found that the neighbourhood of Alnwick\r\nCastle was no place of safety. In the year 1174 William the Lion, while\r\nbesieging the fortress of the De Vescis, was taken prisoner, and the\r\nlarge army under his command was completely routed, De Vesci himself\r\ntaking an active part in the fierce struggle. His descendant, John De\r\nVesci, who died in 1288, leaving no issue, founded and endowed Hulne\r\nAbbey; and he was the first baron of his house who was summoned by the\r\nking to the parliament by writ, his predecessors having been barons by\r\ntenure. William De Vesci III., one of the claimants of the Scottish\r\ncrown, was born in 1245, and succeeded to the barony of Alnwick on the\r\ndeath of his brother. The last baron of Alnwick of his race, he died in\r\n1297, without legitimate issue, having infeoffed the celebrated Anthony\r\nBec, Bishop of Durham, with all his lands and his castle of Alnwick, to\r\nhold them in trust for an illegitimate son. But in 1309 the bishop sold\r\nthe castle and barony of Alnwick to Henry de Percy; and this conveyance\r\nwas confirmed by Edward II. in 1310.\r\n\r\nDeriving, as it would seem, their memorable name from that district\r\nin Normandy in which from an early period, long before the Norman\r\nConquest of England, their family had been established, the PERCIES\r\nwere represented in the ranks of the Conqueror at Hastings by William\r\nde Percy, who assumed the additional name of Le Gernons, or Algernon,\r\nas a personal epithet denoting the mass of hair which he wore about\r\nhis face. About 1166, or almost an exact century after the battle of\r\nHastings, the wealth, dignities, and power of the Percies centred in an\r\nheiress who, perhaps in 1168, married Josceline de Louvain, second son\r\nof the Duke of Brabant, and half-brother to the second queen of Henry\r\nI. of England. A legend has been preserved, which relates that on her\r\nmarriage with Josceline, Agnes de Percy stipulated that her husband,\r\nat his own option, should assume either the arms or the name of Percy;\r\nand it is added that the bridegroom elected to retain his own arms, the\r\nblue lion rampant of Brabant, while he assumed the paternal surname\r\nof his bride. This legend, however, must be regarded as the poetic\r\noffspring of a later age, since at the time of the marriage of Agnes de\r\nPercy armorial insignia had neither assumed any definite character, nor\r\nhad any such insignia become hereditary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Prudhoe Tower and Chapel._]\r\n\r\nThere is nothing to show that Josceline de Louvain ever bore the name\r\nof Percy; but it is certain that the surname of his mother was assumed\r\nand borne by the second son of Josceline’s marriage with the Percy\r\nheiress, Henry de Percy; and by his descendants and successors the\r\nsame name was regularly borne. It was Sir Henry de Percy, third of the\r\nname, who in 1309, the second year of Edward II., when already he was\r\npossessed of vast wealth, and great power, became the _first Lord of\r\nAlnwick of the House of Percy_, by purchase from Bishop Anthony Bec.\r\nHaving taken an active part in the wars with Scotland and otherwise\r\ndistinguished himself among the foremost men of his time, Henry, first\r\nBaron Percy of Alnwick, died in 1315, and was buried at Fountains\r\nAbbey, to which institution he had been a munificent benefactor. One of\r\nthe powerful barons who signed the memorable letter to Pope Boniface\r\nVIII., in which the peers of England refused to recognise or allow the\r\ninterference of Papal authority with the independent sovereignty of\r\nthis realm, he married Eleanor Fitz-Alan, daughter of Richard, Earl of\r\nArundel, by whom he had two sons, and of these the elder, another Henry\r\nde Percy, succeeded his father as second Baron Percy of Alnwick, to\r\nwhom was granted by Edward III. the castle and manor of Warkworth “for\r\nservice in peace and war,” as appears from the original grant now in\r\nthe Duke of Northumberland’s possession. This Lord Percy was interred\r\nat Alnwick Abbey, the only head of the family buried in Northumberland.\r\nThe history of the lords of Alnwick from this period becomes so closely\r\ninterwoven with the history of England, that it would be superfluous\r\nin such a sketch as the present to attempt to introduce even a slight\r\noutline of the career of each of those renowned barons; and, indeed,\r\nif it were desirable, it would not be possible here to find space for\r\nthe very slightest outline of so comprehensive a subject. Accordingly,\r\nwe now are content to give but little more than the succession of the\r\nPercies after they became lords of Alnwick.\r\n\r\nHenry de Percy, eldest son of the first baron, succeeded his father\r\nas second Baron Percy of Alnwick; he died in 1352, leaving, by his\r\nwife Idonea de Clifford (whose magnificent monument, with its rich and\r\nsplendid architectural canopy, unsurpassed in England, and also without\r\na rival in its remarkable condition of preservation, is the pride of\r\nBeverley Minster), four sons, of whom the eldest, Henry, succeeded as\r\nthird Baron Percy of Alnwick. This baron died in 1368; his eldest son,\r\nby Mary of Lancaster, Henry de Percy, sixth of his name and fourth\r\nbaron, was created EARL OF NORTHUMBERLAND by Richard II., and High\r\nConstable of England. This great noble fell a victim to the tyranny of\r\nHenry IV., at Bramham Moor, in 1409. He was thrice married: first to\r\nElizabeth, heiress to the Earl of Angus, by whom he acquired the barony\r\nof Prudhoe; secondly to Margaret de Neville; and thirdly to Maud de\r\nLucy, sister and heiress of Lord Lucy, widow of Gilbert de Umfraville,\r\nand mother of her second husband’s first wife: and by these alliances\r\nthe barony of Prudhoe, with the estates of the Lucys and the castle\r\nand honour of Cockermouth, became annexed to the Percy earldom. Sir\r\nHenry de Percy, known by his surname of HOTSPUR as well in song as in\r\nhistory,—\r\n\r\n  “Who was sweet Fortune’s minion and her pride,”\r\n\r\nthe earl’s eldest son, was killed near Shrewsbury in 1403. At Trotton,\r\nin Sussex, a fine monumental brass commemorates Elizabeth de Mortimer,\r\nwife of Hotspur, and afterwards of Lord Camoys.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Keep._]\r\n\r\nAfter several years the fortified honours and estates of the Percies\r\nwere restored to Henry, the son of Hotspur, who thus became the second\r\nEarl of Northumberland. This great earl was killed, fighting under\r\nthe red-rose banner, at St. Albans, in 1455; and was succeeded by his\r\nfourth surviving son, by his marriage with Eleanor de Neville, another\r\nHenry, who, with one of his brothers, fell at the disastrous rout of\r\nTowton, in 1461. Two other brothers of this earl died in arms in the\r\nLancastrian cause; one of them, Sir Ralph de Percy, a few days before\r\nthe final catastrophe at Hexham in 1464, was killed fighting bravely on\r\nHedgeley Moor, where a cross was erected as a memorial of his valour\r\nand his fall: of this cross the shaft, adorned with the heraldic\r\ninsignia of Percy and Lucy, is still standing. Under the third earl,\r\nwho, by his marriage with Eleanor de Poynings, acquired the baronies\r\nof Poynings, Fitzpayne, and Bryan, the estates attached to the earldom\r\nreached their greatest territorial extent, and constituted a vast\r\nprincipality.\r\n\r\nIn 1469 the attainder of the third earl having been reversed, his only\r\nson, Henry, became the fourth earl; he was killed in a popular tumult\r\nin 1489, when his eldest son, by his marriage with Maud de Herbert,\r\nHenry Algernon, succeeded as fifth earl. Remarkable rather for an\r\nalmost regal state and magnificence than for the warlike qualities that\r\nbefore his time had been hereditary in his house, he was the first\r\nEarl of Northumberland who did not fall in battle or otherwise suffer\r\na violent death. He died in 1527, having married Catherine Spense, or\r\nSpencer. The Household Book of this earl, which has been published\r\nby Bishop Percy, is one of the most remarkable and characteristic\r\ndocuments that illustrate the personal history of the greatest English\r\nnobles in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. His son, the sixth\r\nearl, a second Henry Algernon de Percy, the lover of Anne Boleyn in\r\nher earlier and really happier days, married Mary Talbot, daughter of\r\nthe Earl of Shrewsbury, but in 1537 died without issue, when the grand\r\nPercy earldom became extinct.\r\n\r\nTwenty years later, “in consideration of his noble descent, constancy,\r\nvirtue, and valour in deeds of arms, and other shining qualifications,”\r\nof which last recommendations to royal favour the fact that he was a\r\nzealous Roman Catholic certainly was not the least influential, Thomas\r\nde Percy, eldest son of the second son of the fifth earl (Sir Thomas\r\nPercy), was created by Queen Mary, Baron Percy, and also restored to\r\nthe earldom of Northumberland; but the tenure by which the restored\r\nearl was to hold his dignities and lands restricted the succession\r\nabsolutely to the heirs male of his own body, and to those of his\r\nbrother. This the seventh earl was executed, as a traitor, at York,\r\nin 1572, leaving no surviving son. Accordingly, his brother, Henry\r\nde Percy, became the eighth earl: he died in 1585, having been shot\r\n(it was said, but most doubtfully, by his own hand) while a prisoner\r\nin the Tower. The eldest son of this earl, by Catherine de Neville,\r\nHenry, succeeded as ninth earl: he was a learned, eccentric personage,\r\ncommonly known as “the Wizard,” and died, after an imprisonment of\r\nfifteen years in the Tower, in 1632. He married Dorothy Devereux,\r\nand was succeeded by his eldest son, Algernon, one of the noblest of\r\nhis race. This great earl died in 1668, having married, first, Anne\r\nCecil, and, secondly, Elizabeth Howard. His successor, his only son\r\n(by his second marriage), Josceline de Percy, the eleventh and last\r\nearl of Northumberland of the direct lineage of the Percies, died in\r\n1670, leaving, by his wife Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas, Earl of\r\nSouthampton, an only child, a daughter, Elizabeth de Percy, four years\r\nold at the time of her father’s death.\r\n\r\nHere we pause, before we trace onwards the fortunes of the later lords\r\nof Alnwick, that we may direct our attention to the history of their\r\ngrandest northern fortress-home, Alnwick Castle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Norman Gateway in the Keep._]\r\n\r\nThe plan of the castle, as it exists at the present time, is shown in\r\nour engraving; and it will be seen that five distinct periods in the\r\narchitectural history are indicated by varieties of shading introduced\r\ninto the outlines. The extreme extent of the walls from east to west\r\nslightly exceeds 1,000 feet; while that from north to south is somewhat\r\nless than 600 feet. The varied outline of the space enclosed within\r\nthe walls, which in a great measure has been determined by the nature\r\nof the ground, in an infinite degree enhances the equally noble and\r\npicturesque aspect of the edifice. The figures in the plan refer to\r\nthe various parts of the castle in the manner following:—1, is the\r\nBarbican; 2, the Gateway to the second Baly; 3, the Octagonal Towers;\r\n4, the Norman Gateway; 5, the Grand Staircase; 6, the Guard Chamber;\r\n7, the Principal Ante-Room; 8, the Library; 9, the Saloon; 10, the\r\nDrawing-Room; 11, the Dining Hall; 12, the Chapel; 13 and 14, State\r\nBed-Rooms, 15, Boudoir of the Duchess; 16, Kitchen; 17, Estate Offices;\r\n18, Laundry; 19, Guest-Hall; 20, Stables; 21, Riding-School; 22, West\r\nGarret; 23, Abbot’s Tower; 24, Falconer’s Tower; 25, Postern Tower;\r\n26, Constable’s Tower; 27, Ravine Tower; 28, East Garret; 29, Warder’s\r\nTower; 30, Auditor’s Tower; 31, Clock Tower; and 32, the Avener’s\r\nTower. Thus, the open ground within the circumvallation, as will be\r\nseen by the plan, is divided into two irregular spaces, the outer and\r\nthe inner Baly, the outer being toward the west. Occupying a central\r\nposition is the Keep, a grand cluster of towers and curtain-walls,\r\nenclosing an open court-yard: of these towers, the new Prudhoe Tower,\r\nwithin which is the Library (No. 8), with its lofty banner-turret,\r\nis the most conspicuous. Running south, commencing with No. 13 and\r\nextending to No. 2, a new range of buildings connects the Keep with\r\nthe early Percy gateway between the balies, and with the main southern\r\ncurtain. In this direction, all the buildings, from No. 29 to No. 17,\r\nand from thence (with the exception of No. 31, which is one of the\r\nflanking towers of the main curtain) to No. 19 southward, and to No. 21\r\nwestward, are new, and they have been erected beyond and without the\r\nlimits of the proper fortification. In like manner, the whole line of\r\ncurtain-wall, from No. 24 to No. 25, is new. To the north of the Keep\r\nthe ground falls somewhat rapidly in the direction of the river; from\r\nthe bridge which here crosses the Aln, the view of THE CASTLE, as its\r\ngroups of towers and its far-extending walls rise proudly above the\r\nencircling woods, is particularly fine and impressive.\r\n\r\nThe principal approach and entrance to the castle are from the west.\r\nHere, to the westward of the original outer face of the fosse, stands\r\nthe Barbican; an embattled outwork of equal strength and dignity, the\r\nwork of the first of the Percies, about A.D. 1310. The rounded arch of\r\nthe entrance gateway here is an example of a usage not very uncommon\r\nat the period which has just been specified, and always present in the\r\nworks of Lord Henry de Perci. The Barbican, which covers an area of 55\r\nfeet in length by 32 feet in width, is a perfect example of the style\r\nof fortification that was held to be essential for defence against\r\nassault in mediæval warfare. One remarkable feature, which is repeated\r\nagain and again in various parts of the castle, cannot fail at once\r\nto attract attention when approaching the Barbican; this is the array\r\nof tall figures representing armed warders of the fourteenth century,\r\nsculptured in stone, which surmount the parapet, and stand upon the\r\nmerlons of the embattling, casting their long shadows upon the grey\r\nmasonry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Armourer’s Tower._]\r\n\r\nHaving entered the Barbican, passed under the sculptured Percy\r\nlion which keeps guard over the archway, and traversed the entrance\r\ntower, we find ourselves within the enclosure of the first or outer\r\nbaly; here, turning to the left, we commence our survey of the castle\r\nwithin the lines of circumvallation. The curtain-wall, extending from\r\nthe entrance northwards at a right angle to the Abbot’s Tower, and\r\nhaving midway a garret or wall-tower (No. 22 in plan) built upon it,\r\nis part of the old Norman work of the De Vescis, with evident tokens\r\nof important reparation a little before the middle of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, by the father of Hotspur, the sixth lord of Alnwick. The\r\nArmourer’s Tower (No. 23 in plan), which occupies the N.W. angle\r\nof the _enceinte_, is a noble piece of Edwardian architecture; it\r\nconsists of a vaulted basement, with two stories above it, connected\r\nby a turret-stair: and its external massive effectiveness is greatly\r\nenhanced by the square turret at the N.W. angle of the tower, which\r\nrises boldly above the embattled parapet, having its own merlons\r\ncrowned with weather-beaten sculptured warders. Now facing eastwards,\r\nand soon making a slight inclination towards the east, again we follow\r\nthe line of the Norman curtain-walls, until we reach the new Falconer’s\r\nTower (No. 24 in plan), which has been built on the site of the razed\r\nearly Armourer’s and Falconer’s Towers; the original curtain apparently\r\nextended in a direct line from No. 24 to the Keep. Passing onwards\r\nalong the new curtain-wall due east from No. 24, we follow the line\r\nof this wall as it turns towards the south, and at No. 25 in the plan\r\nbrings us to the Postern Tower, another massive relic of the first Lord\r\nPercy, placed at the base of the eminence upon which the Keep stands;\r\nthis tower protects a postern or sally-port, and it has a curious\r\nstaircase in the thickness of its walls: it is now used as a museum for\r\nRoman and British antiquities. Advancing still further eastwards, but\r\nwith an inclination to the north, and again following the course of De\r\nVesci’s curtain, we reach the Constable’s Tower (No. 26 in plan), of\r\nEdwardian architecture, to which there are three external entrances,\r\none in each floor: one chamber in this tower is used as an armoury.\r\nAgain, as we follow the guidance of the curtain-wall towards the S.E.,\r\nwe have before us the Norman masonry, with traces of Edwardian, or\r\nfirst Percy, reparation. Here, about midway between Nos. 26 and 27 of\r\nthe plan, an embattled projection from the line of the wall has been\r\nentitled “Hotspur’s Chair,” and to the east of this projection a gap in\r\nthe curtain is filled up with eighteenth-century masonry; this gap a\r\nnot very well-supported tradition assigns to a fierce assault by some\r\nScots, who are said to have been so far successful as to beat down\r\nthis portion of the castle-wall, after which exploit the tradition\r\nadds that the assailants were cut off to a man by the garrison. This\r\ntower, which is called both the Ravine Tower and the Record Tower\r\n(No. 27 of plan), stands at the easternmost extremity of the castle;\r\nwith Edwardian remains in its walls, it was for the most part rebuilt\r\nin the last century: on the ground-floor is the muniment-room, in\r\nwhich the records are kept. From this point our course inclines in\r\na south-westerly direction, the curtain being eighteenth-century\r\nwork, until again, at No. 28 in the plan, we welcome traces of the\r\nearly masonry: here another garret occurs, with the junction of the\r\nNorman and modern masonry; then yet another succeeds, as once more\r\nwe follow an eighteenth-century wall until we reach the new Lion or\r\nGarden Gatehouse, No. 29 in the plan, through which a road leads to\r\nBarneyside, where are situated the extensive and beautiful gardens of\r\nthe castle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _On the Barbican._]\r\n\r\nFrom within this gateway, which is flanked by two octagonal towers,\r\none of them—the Warder’s Tower—larger and loftier than the other,\r\nthe curtain-wall of the first Lord Percy’s work leads in a direct line\r\nnearly due west; we follow the course of this wall, we pass through\r\nthe middle gate-house, erected by the first of the Percies, which both\r\nseparates and connects the inner and the outer baly; again, on our\r\nleft, we have early Norman masonry in the curtain, and then we reach\r\nthe Auditor’s Tower (No. 30 in plan), another relic of the first Lord\r\nPercy: here was held the court of the lord of the barony; here now\r\nis the private Library of the Duke; and here also is the Museum of\r\nEgyptian Antiquities, collected by Duke Algernon, the last munificent\r\nrestorer of Alnwick. Still following the line of the curtain, we\r\nreach the Clock Tower. From this tower, the curtain, built in the\r\nlast century, leads in a northerly direction to the entrance gateway\r\nconnected with the Barbican, to which, thus completing our entire\r\ncircuit, we now return, having passed, since leaving the Clock Tower,\r\nthe Avener’s Tower or Garner (No. 32 of plan), like the adjoining\r\ncurtain, a modern work.\r\n\r\nDuring our progress from the garden gate (No. 29 in plan) westward\r\nand northward to the Barbican, we have passed the long ranges of new\r\nbuildings that either adjoin or actually abut upon the outer face of\r\nthe curtain-walls (Nos. 16 to 21 in plan), by no means unimportant\r\nparts of the latest restoration, which comprise all the domestic\r\noffices and the whole stable department of the castle. These buildings,\r\nwhich have been planned and constructed with the highest architectural\r\nand engineering skill, are on a scale of princely magnitude; and of\r\nthem it may truly be said that they leave nothing to be desired. Of\r\none only of these new edifices is it necessary that we should make\r\nparticular mention; this is No. 19 on the plan, a noble apartment,\r\ncovered with an open timber hammer-beam roof. In consequence of there\r\nbeing in the restored castle no such baronial hall as invariably formed\r\nthe principal feature in a great mediæval stronghold, Duke Algernon\r\nbuilt this Guest Hall in its stead, which might enable himself and his\r\nsuccessors to assemble his and their tenantry and friends to partake of\r\nthe always splendid hospitality of the Percies. This hall has also been\r\nused for concerts and various other purposes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Well in the Keep._]\r\n\r\nFrom the Barbican we retrace our steps so far as to traverse the\r\nroadway that leads to the inner Gate-House (No. 2 in plan), that we may\r\nexplore the magnificent Keep: this, however, is a duty we postpone;\r\npausing for a while, and resting beneath the tree that grows beside\r\nthe Barbican. Presently, we shall resume our biographical sketch, and\r\nobserve by what means an only daughter once again became the ancestress\r\nof a noble lineage, and through them brought to the house and castle of\r\nthe Percies a still more exalted dignity and a still higher honour than\r\never before had been attained by them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Constable’s Tower._]\r\n\r\nAnd we rejoice to know that the noble line of the Percies was not\r\ndestined finally to fail with a failure of a direct heir male; it also\r\nis a subject for rejoicing that over the towers of Alnwick there still\r\nshould wave a banner, charged with the same quarterings that in the\r\nolden time were so well known to the breezes of Northumberland. As it\r\nhas been well said, Alnwick Castle has ever been esteemed as the old\r\nhead-quarters of border chivalry; and, in truth, it is a subject for\r\nnational pride to feel it has that same aspect still. No one assuredly\r\ncan “look upon this very ‘gudlye howsse,’ as King Harry’s commissioners\r\ncalled it, or upon its grassy courts fringed with ‘faire towres,’ its\r\nstately keep with its ‘marveylouse fare vaulte’ ‘and tryme ladgings,’”\r\nas they are described about the middle of the sixteenth century, in the\r\nsurvey made by Clarkson for the seventh earl, “without feeling that he\r\nhad seen the martial, social, and most knightly centre of mediæval life\r\nin Northumberland.” And so also, in like manner, no one now can visit\r\nAlnwick Castle, and not feel deeply impressed with the conviction that\r\nthe England, of which the past history possesses monumental records\r\nand still living witnesses such as this, is a land rich as well in the\r\nmost precious elements of present strength as in the most glorious of\r\nmemories; and so, when her true sons look forward to the future of\r\nEngland, they may do so in the spirit of the fine old motto of the\r\nPercies—ESPERANCE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe annals of the truly noble family of the Percies, as we have seen,\r\ndown to the death of Josceline, the eleventh earl, in 1670, extend\r\nover five centuries, during three hundred and sixty-one years of\r\nwhich period, almost without interruption, the family was intimately\r\nconnected with Alnwick. By the limitation of the patent of 1557, the\r\nyouthful daughter of Earl Josceline was incapable of inheriting her\r\nfather’s honours, and thus, at last, the Percies’ earldom again became\r\nextinct, when no inconsiderable part of their immense possessions\r\nlapsed to the crown: the great northern earldom, however, was not\r\npermitted in this manner to pass away without more than one fruitless\r\neffort on the part of collateral descendants to establish a claim to\r\nthe succession.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the alienation of some of the estates consequent upon\r\nthe extinction of the Earldom of Northumberland, Elizabeth Percy, the\r\ndaughter of the last earl, was the most wealthy heiress in the realm;\r\nand, accordingly, it was considered to be a matter of the greatest\r\nimportance that a suitable alliance should be arranged for her with\r\nthe least possible delay. When but little more than a child, in 1679,\r\nshe was married to Henry Cavendish, Earl of Ogle, and heir to the Duke\r\nof Newcastle, who died in the following year. Before another year\r\nhad expired, the youthful widow was again married to Thomas Thynn of\r\nLongleat; but once more the heiress became a widow very shortly after\r\nher marriage. Her second husband was murdered early in 1682, as he was\r\npassing in his coach along Pall Mall. While she was still not more than\r\nfifteen years of age, within three months after the tragedy in Pall\r\nMall, Elizabeth Percy became the wife of Charles Seymour, sixth Duke\r\nof Somerset, by whom only she had issue: she died in 1722, leaving,\r\nbesides three daughters, one only surviving son, Algernon, who in 1748\r\nsucceeded his father as seventh Duke of Somerset. In 1749 this duke was\r\ncreated Baron of Warkworth and Earl of Northumberland, with remainder\r\nof those dignities to the heirs male of his daughter, his only\r\nsurviving child, by her marriage with Sir Hugh Smithson. The duke died\r\nin 1750, when the Seymour dignities reverted to the male descendants of\r\nthe Protector Somerset by his first marriage. Thus, once more, an only\r\ndaughter, now bearing the paternal name of Seymour, was the heiress and\r\nrepresentative of the Percy lords of Alnwick: and thus, by reason of\r\nhis alliance with this lady, Sir Hugh Smithson became _jure uxoris_, by\r\nspecial Act of Parliament, Earl of Northumberland; and he himself, his\r\ncountess, and their descendants, were empowered and authorised to take\r\nand use the surname of Percy alone, and to bear and quarter all the\r\narmorial insignia of that noble house.\r\n\r\nThe fortunate husband of this last heiress of the Percies, on the death\r\nof his grandfather, Sir Hugh Smithson, in the year 1729, succeeded to\r\nthe baronetcy, which had been conferred by Charles II. in 1663 on that\r\ngrandfather’s grandfather, also a Hugh Smithson. A remarkably handsome\r\nman, with a refined taste, and in many other respects well qualified\r\nfor the distinguished destiny which awaited him, Sir Hugh Smithson\r\nis said to have been in no slight degree indebted for his eventual\r\nsplendid matrimonial success to a previous failure. He had attracted\r\nthe attention of Lady Percy, who, on hearing that some other lady had\r\nrejected the suit of Sir Hugh Smithson, expressed her surprise that any\r\nlady should have refused to accept such a man. The words of the fair\r\nand noble heiress reached the ears of the disconsolate baronet, and\r\nthey promptly wrought a marvellous change in his views and aspirations.\r\nUpon the hint so given Sir Hugh spoke, and—his words were not in\r\nvain. In nearly all the “Peerages,” borrowed one from another, it is\r\nstated that this Sir Hugh Smithson early in life went to London, where\r\nhe established himself in business as an apothecary. Although no slur\r\nwould thus have been cast on the illustrious race, it is simply untrue.\r\nThe following statement, extracted from a “Baronetage” published in\r\n1727, may be accepted in proof:—\r\n\r\n“The present Sir Hugh Smithson married a sister of the late Lord\r\nLangdale, and had two sons, who lived to man’s estate. Hugh, the\r\neldest, died unmarried before his father; Langdale Smithson, the second\r\nson, married Miss Revely, by whom he left only one son, Hugh—now a\r\nminor, and a most hopeful young gentleman—so that there now remain\r\nonly two heirs to the title and estate—this young gentleman, Sir\r\nHugh’s grandson, and Hugh Smithson, of Tottenham, Esq., cousin of Sir\r\nHugh.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The East Garret._]\r\n\r\nThe “young gentleman” in question succeeded his grandfather as Sir\r\nHugh Smithson, of Stanwick. There was no trace in any documents\r\nor papers of his ever having been in any position but that of the\r\nacknowledged heir to a considerable estate and to a baronetage, granted\r\nto his ancestor for his loyalty and sacrifices in the royal cause\r\nduring the civil wars of Charles I.[21] He married Lady Percy on the\r\n16th of July, 1740, when he became Earl of Northumberland with all the\r\nterritorial greatness attendant on that earldom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Garden Gate, or Warder’s Tower._]\r\n\r\nIn 1766 the earl was created Duke of Northumberland and Earl Percy,\r\nwith succession to his heirs male; and, finally, in 1784, the barony of\r\nLovaine was added to the duke’s accumulated dignities, with remainder\r\nto the younger of his two sons. The duchess died in 1776, but the duke\r\nsurvived till 1786: they had one daughter, who died unmarried, and\r\ntwo sons, Hugh and Algernon, of whom the elder succeeded his father\r\nas second Duke of Northumberland, a distinguished general officer in\r\nthe first American War. The second duke married, first, a daughter of\r\nthe then Earl of Bute; and, secondly, Frances Julia, third daughter of\r\nPeter Burrell, Esquire, a Commissioner of the Excise, by whom he had\r\na numerous family: the duke died in 1817, and was succeeded by Hugh,\r\nhis eldest son, who thus became the third Duke of Northumberland, the\r\nprincely representative of George IV. at the coronation of Charles X.\r\nof France. This third duke died, without issue, in 1847, having married\r\nLady Charlotte Florentia Clive, youngest daughter of Earl Powis: and\r\nthus the dukedom passed to the third duke’s brother, the younger son of\r\nthe second duke, who at the time of his brother’s death bore the title\r\nof Baron Prudhoe—an independent peerage to which he himself had been\r\nelevated in 1816, in consideration of his services as an officer in the\r\nnavy.\r\n\r\nAlgernon Percy, fourth Duke of Northumberland, was born in 1792; in\r\n1842 he married the Lady Eleanor Grosvenor, daughter of the Marquis of\r\nWestminster; in 1847 he succeeded to the honours and possessions of his\r\nfamily; he was created a K.G. in 1852, when he also held the office of\r\nFirst Lord of the Admiralty; and on February 12th, 1865, he died at\r\nAlnwick Castle, and, as his brother and predecessor had died, without\r\nany issue. Like the great soldier, with whose memory the dukedom of\r\nWellington must ever be directly associated, Sir Algernon Percy will\r\nlong be remembered with affectionate and grateful admiration as THE\r\nDuke of Northumberland. A true English sailor, a princely English\r\nNobleman, an elegant scholar and an accomplished gentleman, large of\r\nheart too and open of hand, with his commanding presence Duke Algernon\r\nlooked every inch a Percy; and, in very deed, in his person were\r\ncentred the brightest of the brilliant qualities of his forefathers, in\r\nhappy combination with those admirable endowments that were peculiarly\r\nhis own.\r\n\r\nThe two sons of the first duke (as we have seen) bore the same names\r\nas the two sons of his successor the second duke—Hugh and Algernon\r\nPercy. The two brothers, the sons of the first duke, married two\r\nsisters, daughters of Mr. Burrell.[22] With Duke Algernon the line of\r\nHugh, the elder of the sons of the first duke, became extinct; and,\r\nconsequently, the succession to the dukedom passed to the descendants\r\nof that other Algernon who was the younger son of the first duke. This\r\nAlgernon, who on the death of his father became Baron Lovaine, in 1798\r\nwas created Earl of Beverley: he died in 1830. George Percy, his son,\r\nthen succeeded as Earl of Beverley; and subsequently, in 1865, at that\r\ntime being in the 87th year of his age, this venerable nobleman became\r\nthe fifth Duke of Northumberland. He died August 21, 1867; and was\r\nsucceeded by his eldest surviving son (by his marriage with Louisa,\r\ndaughter of the Hon. A. Stuart Wortley). The present peer, Algernon\r\nGeorge Percy, sixth Duke and eighteenth Earl of Northumberland, Earl\r\nPercy, Earl of Beverley, Baron Warkworth, Baron Lovaine of Alnwick,\r\nand a baronet, was born May 2nd, 1810, and was educated at Eton. He\r\nentered the army in 1827, and retired in 1836. In 1858 he was a Lord of\r\nthe Admiralty, in 1859 Vice-President of the Board of Trade, and from\r\n1831 to 1865 sat in Parliament, first for Beeralston and afterwards for\r\nNorth Northumberland. He is Colonel of the Northumberland Militia, Hon.\r\nColonel of the Percy Northumberland Volunteer Artillery, and President\r\nof the National Lifeboat Institution. In 1845 his grace married Louisa,\r\ndaughter of the late Henry Drummond, Esq., M.P., of Abury Park, Surrey,\r\nby whom he has issue living two sons, viz., Henry George Percy, Earl of\r\nPercy, married, in 1868, to Lady Edith Campbell, eldest daughter of the\r\nDuke of Argyll, by whom he has issue; and Lord Algernon Malcolm Arthur\r\nPercy. His grace is patron of twenty-two livings, nineteen of which are\r\nin Northumberland and one each in Yorkshire, Dorsetshire, and Surrey.\r\n\r\nThe arms of the Duke of Northumberland are: Quarterly, 1st and 4th\r\nLovaine and Lucy quarterly (viz., 1st and 4th, _or_, a lion rampant,\r\n_azure_, for Lovaine, 2nd and 3rd, _gules_, three luces or pikes,\r\nhauriant, for Lucy), 2nd and 3rd, _azure_, five lozenges conjoined\r\nin fesse, _or_, for Percy. Crest: On a chapeau, _gules_, turned up,\r\n_ermine_, a lion statant, tail extended, _azure_. Supporters: Dexter, a\r\nlion, _azure_; sinister, a lion, guardant, _or_, gorged with a collar\r\ncompony, _argent_ and _azure_.\r\n\r\nHis grace’s other seats are, Keilder, Prudhoe, and Warkworth castles,\r\nin Northumberland; Sion House, Middlesex; Stanwick Park, Yorkshire;\r\nAlbury Park; and Northumberland House, Charing Cross.\r\n\r\nThus having brought down our sketch of the lords of Alnwick, from the\r\nearly days in English history that immediately followed the Norman\r\nConquest to the times now present, we return to their noble castle on\r\nthe banks of the Aln.\r\n\r\nWithin a few years of the Conquest, the Normans erected in various\r\nparts of England important edifices, both military and ecclesiastical,\r\nin truly astonishing numbers: and of these, in addition to the\r\ncathedrals and the greater churches, there still exist many noble\r\ncastellated relics, some of them in a proximate degree retaining the\r\nleading features of their original arrangement, form, and appearance.\r\nAt the same time, even in the case of the most perfect of the existing\r\ncastles, many changes of grave importance have been introduced as\r\ncentury has succeeded to century; so that now, whenever any one early\r\ncastle is examined with a view to trace out and to determine both what\r\nit was at the first, and in what order and with what motives certain\r\npalpable alterations and innovations have followed one another, it\r\nalways is highly satisfactory to feel that an unquestionable general\r\nuniformity of plan and arrangement in all the early castles enables\r\neach one of them that is still in being, in some degree at any rate,\r\nto illustrate and explain every other. As a matter of course, whenever\r\nthe architectural features in any old castle are original, the great\r\nart of the architect is able, unaided and beyond all controversy, to\r\ntell its own historical tale: but, genuine original architectural\r\nfeatures are not always available to give their conclusive evidence;\r\nand, but too frequently, without some external aid, it is not possible\r\nto follow the career of the two terrible adversaries of early\r\nedifices (and particularly those of the noblest rank), demolition and\r\nrestoration—demolition, either wilful or the result of accident and\r\nchance; and restoration, which always is wilful, though happily not\r\nalways equally destructive.\r\n\r\nAs it now stands, in every quality of high merit ALNWICK CASTLE\r\ncertainly yields to no other restored edifice of a similar rank. Of\r\nthe castle of to-day it may truthfully be affirmed that, with a close\r\napproach to an exact fidelity, in its prevailing external arrangements\r\nand its general features it represents the grand old fortress of\r\ntimes long passed away. Time had dealt somewhat hardly with the Percy\r\nstronghold, and injudicious attempts to make good the ravages of the\r\ndestroyer had aggravated the evil, when the recent great work of\r\nrestoration was taken in hand. Then every vestige of the old structure\r\nwas diligently and carefully examined, and every available early\r\ndocument was critically studied; the remains also of other castles then\r\nwere investigated, and all that they could suggest was applied by the\r\nrestorers of Alnwick to the furtherance of their great project. Hence\r\nthe plan of Alnwick, as we now have it, while it can scarcely claim\r\nto be absolutely identical with the original plan, may be accepted as\r\nnot greatly differing from it in any essential particulars. Whether\r\nYvo de Vesci, the undoubted founder of the castle, was enabled fully\r\nto carry out his own original plans, we are not able at the present\r\ntime accurately to determine; but, still it may be assumed that the\r\nplans of De Vesci, to whatever degree they may have been realised by\r\nhimself, both in extent and in general configuration closely resembled\r\nthose which were worked out by the Percies, when they had become lords\r\nAlnwick, as these, in their turn, were afterwards followed as their\r\nguides by the recent restorers who were employed by Duke Algernon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Bond Gate: “Hotspur’s Gate.”_]\r\n\r\nThe great epochs in the architectural history of Alnwick Castle may be\r\nthus distinguished.\r\n\r\nI. DE VESCI, about A.D. 1150: the original founding of the castle, and\r\nits erection as an Anglo-Norman stronghold.\r\n\r\nII. FIRST PERCY, from 1309 to 1315: the second founding and great\r\nreparation of the castle, with either the complete rebuilding or the\r\noriginal erection of many of its most important parts. At this period\r\nwere erected the Barbican, the Gate-House, the Western Garret; the\r\nAbbot’s, Falconer’s, Armourer’s, Constable’s, and Auditor’s Towers;\r\nalso the Postern and the Ravine Towers, the Gateway between the first\r\nand second baly, with the adjoining curtain-walls both east and west,\r\na great portion of the east side of the Keep, the Well, and the grand\r\nBaronial Hall.\r\n\r\nIII. SECOND PERCY, from 1315 to 1352; the completion of portions of the\r\nworks of the preceding period, and the erection of the two flanking\r\ntowers (No. 8 in plan) in advance of the Norman entrance to the Keep:\r\nthese towers are represented in our engraving.\r\n\r\nIV. THIRD PERCY, ending in 1455: various important reparations and\r\nadditions, most of the latter having been removed by the first duke in\r\nthe next period.\r\n\r\nV. FIRST DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND, from 1750 to 1786: general reparation,\r\nafter a long period of neglect and ruin, including a material\r\ntransformation of the greater part of the castle. The Keep was almost\r\nentirely demolished, and rebuilt after the manner that was called (and,\r\nin one sense of that term, really was) “Gothic” in the eighteenth\r\ncentury in England; and the towers and curtain of the circumvallation\r\nsuffered in like manner.\r\n\r\nVI. FOURTH DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND, from 1854 to 1865: complete\r\nrestoration of the entire castle. The important works erected by Duke\r\nAlgernon along the lines of the circumvallation, and to the south and\r\nthe south-west of these lines, have already been described; in addition\r\nto these, the duke rebuilt the range of apartments extending from the\r\nKeep southwards to the Edwardian Gateway from the first to the second\r\nbaly; and he built the noble Prudhoe Tower, with the chapel adjoining\r\nit, the Ante-Room, the Guard Chamber, the present Dining-Hall, and the\r\ncompletion of the Keep.\r\n\r\nThe governing idea of this restoration was _really to restore_, in\r\nall their leading and most characteristic features, the mediæval\r\narrangements and aspect of Alnwick Castle so far as its exterior was\r\nconcerned; while, at the same time, the whole of the interior of the\r\nrestored edifice was to be planned, fitted, and adorned, in the most\r\nsumptuous style, after the manner of a cinquecento Roman palace, and\r\nwith all the luxurious splendour and the various skilful contrivances\r\nrequired and suggested by the taste and the usages of the present\r\nday. The only important deviation from the former part of the duke’s\r\nplan, was the removal of the Edwardian Towers, and the adjoining\r\ncurtain-wall between the Abbot’s Tower and the Postern Tower, in order\r\nto open the view from the windows of the new Prudhoe Tower towards the\r\nnorth: but the Italian portion of the scheme was accomplished in its\r\nintegrity. The whole of the architectural restoration and rebuilding\r\nwas carried out with the most perfect success, under the direction\r\nof Mr. Salvin, an architect eminently distinguished for his practical\r\nknowledge of the Early Gothic of England in its military aspect, as\r\nalso for both the conscientious fidelity of his restorations and the\r\njudicious consistency of his original designs. We can easily understand\r\nwith what satisfaction Mr. Salvin must have removed the Strawberry\r\nHill pseudo-Gothic of the first duke, as well as the far higher\r\ngratification which must have attended the progressive realisation of\r\nhis own truly admirable compositions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Alnwick Abbey._]\r\n\r\nThe project for causing the thoroughly English mediæval military-Gothic\r\ncasket of Mr. Salvin to enclose contents that should be in every\r\nrespect the very reverse of what is either English or mediæval or\r\nmilitary or Gothic, was discussed and finally adopted at a congress\r\nheld in the castle under the presidency of Algernon, Duke of\r\nNorthumberland, and attended by the English professors of classic\r\narchitecture, Cockerell and Donaldson; the Roman antiquary, the\r\nCommendatore Canina; and the Italian architect, Signor Montiroli. It is\r\nto be regretted that such masters of Gothic Art as Scott, Waterhouse,\r\nStreet, and Burges had not also been present, who might have saved\r\nthe Border Castle of the Percies from the magnificent anomaly of\r\nbeing externally English and internally Roman. The execution of the\r\nwhole of the interior can be described only in terms of the highest\r\ncommendation; and it is especially satisfactory to know that the\r\nprofusion of carved work in an Italian style which was required for\r\nthe various purposes of decoration, and which has been pronounced to\r\nbe “a marvel of delicacy and finish,” was produced under the direction\r\nof Signor Bulletti of Florence, by a staff of English and Scottish\r\ncarvers, who worked for several years in a studio established for that\r\nparticular purpose in the castle. There also was a second studio, in\r\nwhich the more important of the decorations in plaster were modelled\r\nand cast. It is scarcely necessary to add that in all the minor\r\ndetails of furnishing, the grand original plan has been fully and\r\nfaithfully carried into effect. While we cordially recognise as well\r\nthe enlarged views and the princely munificence of the duke himself,\r\nas the skill, the taste, and the ability of every individual who took\r\npart in his great work of restoration, it is impossible not to regret\r\nthat so glorious an opportunity for vindicating the versatile and\r\ncomprehensive powers of true Gothic art should have been permitted to\r\npass away. There can be no question as to the capacity of the same\r\ngreat style to have rendered the interior of Alnwick Castle a type of\r\nsplendid, and yet agreeable, magnificence, which on the exterior has\r\ndisplayed its structural resources in a manner at once so noble and\r\nso consistent. But, as this was not to be, we rejoice in knowing that\r\nwhat has been done within the Percy walls has been done so well; and\r\nour gratification is the more sincere and the more hearty, because at\r\nevery point the Percy walls themselves, true to their grand traditions,\r\nwear such an aspect as Hotspur might have recognised with an approving\r\nsmile, and the old Earls of Northumberland would have been proud to\r\naccept as becoming their northern home.[23]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Percy Cross._]\r\n\r\nAnd here we resume our survey of the castle, setting forth towards\r\nthe Keep from within the Gate-House, which is itself situated within\r\nthe Barbican. We proceed eastwards to the gateway (No. 2 in plan),\r\nwhich admits us to the second or inner baly. From this we approach the\r\nentrance to the Keep, and pass between the Edwardian flanking towers\r\nwith their octagonal fronts (No. 3 in the plan): thus we reach the\r\ngrand old Norman arch, De Vesci’s work, massive and deeply recessed,\r\nrich with zig-zags and bands of sharp indentations, which forms the\r\nmain entrance to the innermost court or ward of the Keep itself.\r\nImmediately adjoining the Norman archway is the draw-well constructed\r\nby the first Percy. Now we have before us the new Corridor, carried\r\nround a part of the court on piers and corbels. We pass the inner\r\nporches, and the entrance-halls, and reach the Grand Staircase (No. 5\r\nin plan), worthily so called, and we find that we have entered such a\r\npalace as might overlook, not the Aln, but the Tiber. At the head of\r\nthe noble flight of steps, each one of them a single block of white\r\nRothbury stone, twelve feet in length, is the Guard-Chamber, with its\r\nfloor of rich Venetian mosaic, its panelled ceiling, and the deep\r\nfrieze reflecting the memories of Chevy Chase. Corridors lead to both\r\nthe right hand and the left from the Guard-Room; and it also gives\r\naccess to a gorgeous Ante-Room, placed between the great Library, 54\r\nfeet long, which occupies the entire range of the Prudhoe Tower, and\r\nfollows its contour; and the Saloon, another magnificent apartment, in\r\nlength 42 feet with a bay formed by a circular tower. Next succeeds\r\nthe State Drawing-Room, of irregular form, its largest measurements\r\nbeing 46 by 34 feet. Then we enter the grand Dining-Hall, 60 feet\r\nlong, and in both width and height 24 feet, which covers the site\r\nof the old baronial hall of the early Percies. The Breakfast-Room\r\nadjoins this most princely hall, and, passing it, the Corridor leads\r\nus in succession to the State Bed-Rooms and Dressing-Rooms, and to\r\nthe private apartments of the duke and duchess, together with other\r\nstaircases. Thus, on the principal floor there are two staircases\r\nbesides the grand staircase, and eighteen chambers, exclusive of the\r\nchapel. The Chapel (No. 12 in plan), of which we give a view from\r\nthe outer baly, is a building of great beauty and interest, having a\r\nstone-vaulted ceiling within a roof of a high pitch, a semi-octagonal\r\napsidal end towards the south-west, and lancet windows: its total\r\nlength is 46 feet, and in the interior it is enriched with Italian\r\nmosaic, after the manner of the Henry III. work in the Confessor’s\r\nChapel in Westminster Abbey. We must be content, in a single brief\r\nsentence (the space at our disposal restricts us absolutely to one such\r\nsentence), to state concerning every apartment in the grand range of\r\nthe entire circuit of the Keep, and also in the southern wing, which\r\nextends to the Percy gateway, that the most gorgeous Art of the Italian\r\n_Renaissance_, with all its manifold resources, has been taxed to the\r\nutmost in order to produce a palace of the highest rank, pervaded\r\nthroughout with harmonious, yet ever-varied, magnificence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Hulne Abbey: The Percy Tower._]\r\n\r\nOn the ground-floor, which is on the same level with the entrance-hall,\r\nare the various apartments, consistently grouped and classified,\r\nrequired by the principal domestics of the household, together with the\r\nwine-cellars, pantries, and such other chambers and appliances as would\r\nbe necessary to complete this department of the ducal establishment.\r\nOnce more we return to the Prudhoe Tower, and ascend above its two\r\nupper floors of bed and dressing-rooms, to the Banner-turret, which\r\nrises to the height of two additional floors; and here, having gained\r\nthe leads, standing beneath the proud insignia of the Percies, heavily\r\nblazoned upon their broad silken banner, we lean over the embattled\r\nparapet, and look down upon the Keep, and around upon the cordon of\r\ntowers and walls, and the fair domains and the silvery river beyond,\r\nand so we bid farewell to the lordly castle of Alnwick.\r\n\r\nUntil the middle of the fifteenth century was near at hand the town of\r\nAlnwick remained unprotected by a wall, and open consequently to all\r\nperils incidental to its position on the Border. About the year 1433,\r\nhowever, the good town was fortified with walls, and the four entrances\r\nwere defended each by its own strong tower-guarded gateway. One only of\r\nthese early gateways still remains in a fair condition of preservation;\r\nthis, the Bond Gate, sometimes (but without any other reason than a\r\nlingering delight to associate any fine old relic at Alnwick with that\r\nname) is called “Hotspur’s Gate.” It bears a badge of the second Percy\r\nlord of Alnwick, and in all probability was erected by him; its outer\r\nface is represented in the engraving.\r\n\r\nThe other gateways have disappeared;[24] and from the time that\r\nborder-strife passed into the domain of history, the walls of Alnwick\r\ngradually ceased to exist, until now traces only of their former\r\nexistence, and of these “few and far between,” remain to attest the\r\nrecord of their having ever existed. Devoutly it is to be hoped that\r\nthe one relic of the town of the olden time, the Bond Gate, will be\r\ncherished, simply because it is such a relic—because it links the\r\ntown to the castle, and the castle to the town, with the strong tie\r\nof historical association. Again space, or rather the want of it,\r\nconstrains us to leave unnoticed the fine church of St. Michael, the\r\nchurch of St. Paul, founded and erected by Duke Hugh, and the other\r\npublic buildings in Alnwick; and, with them, the privileges, usages,\r\nand the entire local history of the town.[25]\r\n\r\nOf the remains of the early edifices, both ecclesiastical and\r\ncastellated, which are closely associated with Alnwick Castle, all of\r\nthem of great interest, and all of them also no less worthy of detailed\r\ndescription than of careful examination, we must be content briefly to\r\nnotice two—Alnwick Abbey, and Hulne, or Holn, Priory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Hulne Abbey: The Church._]\r\n\r\nBuilt to the north of the Aln, at an easy distance from the castle,\r\nupon a rich soil and in a scene of sequestered beauty, Alnwick Abbey,\r\nfounded in 1147 by Eustace de Vesci for Premonstratensian Canons, was\r\nrichly endowed by the founder and also by his successor. The Percies,\r\nin like manner, were in every respect as munificent as the earlier\r\nbenefactors of the abbey, so that it long occupied an honourable\r\nposition among the religious establishments of the country. The canons\r\nof Alnwick, however, did not rise to distinction in consequence of any\r\neminent attainments; but, on the other hand, while in earlier times\r\nthey were somewhat notorious for a turbulent spirit, the report on\r\ntheir abbey made to Henry VIII. contains a truly deplorable record\r\nof the degrading superstitions by means of which, in common with but\r\ntoo many of their brethren, the monks imposed on the people, and\r\nsometimes even succeeded in deceiving themselves. Of the buildings\r\nof the abbey, which, without doubt, were worthy to take rank with\r\nthose of the castle, the sole relic that is still in existence is a\r\nturreted and embattled gateway, a structure not earlier than the middle\r\nof the fifteenth century. The eastern face of this gateway displays\r\nthe quartered arms of Percy and Lucy; on the other faces are the\r\ninsignia of De Vesci. The other buildings have altogether disappeared,\r\nexcept here and there some sculptured stones which have found their\r\nway into the walls of houses constructed by modern masons. The site\r\nof the abbey, with the Northumberland estates once annexed to it,\r\nafter various vicissitudes, has become the property of the Dukes of\r\nNorthumberland.\r\n\r\nDistant from Alnwick Abbey about two miles along the northern bank of\r\nthe Aln, and like the abbey placed in the midst of the most lovely\r\nscenery, the Priory of HULNE, or HOLN, has so far been more fortunate\r\nthan its more dignified neighbour, that it yet possesses considerable\r\nremains of its original buildings in a condition of picturesque ruin.\r\nA lofty wall still encircles the entire area of the priory—a feature\r\nsufficiently significant of the lawless character of early Border-life,\r\nand of the stern necessity which constrained even a religious community\r\nto rely for security upon the strength of its fortifications. In our\r\nengraving we show the present aspect of the tower, built, as will\r\nbe seen, with massive solidity, by Henry de Percy, fourth Earl of\r\nNorthumberland, in the year 1488; and in another engraving, we give\r\na general view of the ruins of the church, as they are seen from the\r\nnorth-east. It is pleasant to be able to add that the remains of Hulne\r\nPriory are carefully preserved and freely shown. The brethren, who for\r\nmore than three centuries found a secure dwelling-place surrounded\r\nwith the most beautiful scenery, were Carmelite or White Friars; and\r\na romantic story (of which several versions are in existence) is told\r\nconcerning their order in connection with the foundation of this\r\npriory. The site of the priory was given by the second William de Vesci\r\nabout 1240; but the chief endowment came, between 1252 and 1289, from\r\nJohn de Vesci; the house itself, however, appears to have been erected\r\nby Ralph Fulborne, a wealthy landholder of Northumberland, who lived in\r\nthe stirring times when the lords of broad and fertile acres went armed\r\nto fight in the Holy Land against the infidels.[26] In after times the\r\nPercies confirmed the grants of the earlier benefactors of Hulne, and\r\nmade to them some slight additions. The Carmelites of Hulne were men\r\nwho, according to the light of their times, cultivated learning; this\r\nis shown by the still existing catalogue of the numerous manuscripts\r\nthat once formed their library. There has also been preserved another\r\nequally curious and interesting document, formerly the property of\r\nthese Carmelite brethren; it is an inventory of their vestments and\r\nof the fittings of their church, which must have been very costly as\r\nwell as numerous and splendid. Inventories and catalogues such as these\r\npossess a peculiar value, as illustrations of the intellectual pursuits\r\nand character of the monastic age, and also in consequence of the light\r\nthey throw upon the sentiments and usages that then were prevalent in\r\nour country.\r\n\r\nDescending from the secluded hill-side where the ruins of Hulne Priory\r\nnestle amidst the thick woods, and crossing both the vale below, and\r\nthe river beyond it, a roadway leads to the beautiful pleasure-grounds\r\nof Hulne Park. Here on one of the highest of the many elevated points,\r\nand rising above the surrounding trees, is the Tower on the Hill, or\r\nBrislee Tower, erected by the first duke in 1781. This structure is a\r\ncharacteristic specimen of the _Gothesque_ architecture, of which so\r\nmuch was happily removed during the recent restorations, from Alnwick\r\nCastle. From the upper balcony of this tower, at a height of about 70\r\nfeet from the ground, the view is singularly fine, and in its extent\r\ntruly extraordinary. At different points of the compass, and at varying\r\ndistances, this panoramic view comprehends the vale of Whittingham and\r\nthe windings of the Aln; the range of the Cheviots, with a glimpse\r\nof the hills of Teviotdale forty miles away; the memorable high land\r\nof Flodden may also be distinguished; and, towards the sea, are the\r\ncastles of Warkworth, Bambro’, and Dunstanburgh; and beyond them, in a\r\nfringe-like line, lies the sea itself.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that the hospitality for which the lords of\r\nAlnwick have been renowned since the first stone of the castle was laid\r\nis still maintained within its princely walls; its list of “visitors”\r\nduring many centuries past has contained the names of those who were\r\nnot only the loftiest in rank but the most eminent in Art, Science, and\r\nLetters.\r\n\r\nIts park and grounds are among the most perfect in the kingdom;[27]\r\nsuccessive lords have laboured to make them beautiful, and Nature had\r\ngiven auspicious ground on which to work—hill and dell alternate; a\r\nlovely and rapid, though narrow, river runs through them; on either\r\nside are green banks, in many places overhung by the rich foliage\r\nof varied trees; here and there views are obtained of the distant\r\nhills—the Cheviots—with their thousand traditions of times happily\r\ngone by, but which excite interest by their associations with heroic\r\ndeeds—and not unfrequently their “opposites”—of which every spot is\r\nfertile on the border that separates Scotland from England.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Brislee Tower._]\r\n\r\nHappily, there is now no sensation of jealousy or envy, nothing that\r\ncan either humiliate or exasperate, when the Scottishman boasts of\r\ntriumphs over his southern neighbours; nor when he admits that, often,\r\nbefore the bold men of Northumberland he shrunk back in mortal dread.\r\nThe glories of the one have long ceased to be the degradations of the\r\nother; and the spirit of rivalry is only that which has for its aim and\r\nobject the supremacy of the country of both. Will the happy time ever\r\narrive when the three kingdoms shall be as essentially one as the two\r\nhave been for centuries past?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHARDWICK HALL.\r\n\r\n\r\nHARDWICK HALL may take rank among the more stately of the “homes of\r\nEngland.” Stately in its outer aspect, stately in its antique furniture\r\nand its interior fittings and appointments, and truly stately in its\r\nassociations, it is one of the most historically interesting, and\r\none of the most singular and picturesque, of the many “homes” whose\r\ncountless stores of natural beauties and acquired treasures are,\r\nthrough the kindness and liberality of their owners, made accessible\r\nalike to peer and peasant; while it is one of the fullest in its\r\nhistorical associations, and in its power of carrying the mind of the\r\nvisitor back through a long vista of years to those stirring times\r\nwhen “Good Queen Bess,” the strong-minded and strong-headed “master”\r\nof its noble owner, sate on the throne of England. Hardwick and its\r\nsurroundings belong essentially to those times, and to the people who\r\nmoved prominently in them: the very furniture we see to-day pertains to\r\nthat eventful era—for not only is the building itself of the period to\r\nwhich we refer, but so are even the “fittings;” the beds—for here is\r\nthe very bed used by Mary, Queen of Scots, and covered with needlework,\r\nthe work of her own fair hands; the tables around and at which sate\r\n“Bess of Hardwick” with her historic family and brilliant friends; the\r\ntapestry is that which then hung around them, and on which the eyes\r\nof royalty and nobility have rested and “feasted with admiration;”\r\nthe screens, the chairs, the couches,—nay, almost all the objects\r\nthat meet the eye are of those stirring times, and have about them an\r\nhistoric air which seems irresistibly to subdue the mind and to expand\r\nthe thoughts of the visitor.\r\n\r\nEven a _glance_ at the graces and beauties of Derbyshire would demand\r\nfar greater space than we can accord to them: for it is the shire of\r\nall the English shires in which natural beauties are most happily\r\ncombined with cultivated graces; hill and dale alternate at every mile;\r\nrich valleys, through which run fertilising rivers, shut in by mountain\r\nrocks, tree-clad from base to summit; singular peaks, that seem as if\r\nnot formed by Nature, but the work of giant hands; delicious dells,\r\nwhere rivulets sing perpetually, and myriad birds rejoice in spring or\r\nsummer. Other counties may be more sublimely grand, and others more\r\nabundantly fertile, but there is none so truly rich in the picturesque;\r\nwhether of distant views or of by-paths up hill-sides, or through lanes\r\nclothed in perpetual verdure.\r\n\r\nAnd then its history, a page of which may be read at every turn—the\r\nCelt, the Roman, the Saxon, the Dane, the Norman, all the “peoples and\r\nnations” that have made Britain their home, have left in this shire\r\nenduring evidence of possession and progress; and many of its customs\r\nremain unchanged, not only since the beacons were lit on Blakelow or\r\non Bruncliffe, but since the Baal fires were burning on Axe-Edge or\r\nChelmorton.\r\n\r\nProofs of a milder occupancy, too, are to be found in abundance.\r\nNowhere are peaceful “Halls” more numerous—remains of prosperous\r\nepochs: Haddon, of an early date; Wingfield and Hardwick, of a later\r\nperiod; Chatsworth, of a time comparatively recent; and Kedleston, of\r\nan age scarce removed from living memory,—are but a few of the many\r\nthat glorify this beautiful shire. No wonder, therefore, that it is the\r\ncounty of all others to which the tourist is most frequently attracted.\r\n\r\nSurrounded on all sides by charming scenery, and the richest and most\r\nabundant land, Hardwick stands in all its majesty and grace, and\r\nforms—both in the distance, when a first glimpse of its bold outline\r\nis gained from Brackenfield or other heights, or when viewed from\r\nnearer points—a striking feature in the landscape. When approached\r\nfrom one of the great centres for Derbyshire tourists, Matlock, the\r\ndrive is of peculiar interest, and may be, with profit to the future\r\nvisitor, briefly described. Leaving Matlock by way of Matlock Bridge,\r\nthe road passes through what is called Matlock Town, whose picturesque\r\nchurch is seen overtopping the rocks to the right, where the graceful\r\nbend of the river Derwent adds its beauties to the scene; thence\r\npassing along the roadway, Riber—an immense and very steep hill—rises\r\nto the right, and will be noticed as surmounted by the massive\r\nmodern erection of Riber Castle, the residence of Mr. Smedley, the\r\nhydropathist.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Hardwick Hall, with the Entrance Gateway._]\r\n\r\nThe road continues by Tansley, with its church, its mills, and its\r\npretty dales; Tansley, or Dethick, Moor, a wild unreclaimed tract of\r\nmoorland, purple with heather and untrammelled with fences; Washington,\r\nwith its village-green, its stocks, and its duck-ponds; Higham, a\r\npicturesque village with an ancient cross; Shirland, with its fine\r\nmonuments, some of which are of remarkable character and full of\r\ninterest; Morton, with its pretty church and charming cottages; for\r\na short distance the coal district, with their pits and shafts and\r\never-creaking engines; Pilsley and its pleasant lanes; Hardstoft and\r\nDeeplane, to the lower entrance to the Park: through these and other\r\nplaces of deep and varied interest we go, until we reach the Hardwick\r\nInn—a pretty house of entertainment close to the entrance to the\r\nPark, from which a winding ascent of less than a mile leads to the\r\nHall. By this route some curious transitions from the lead-mining\r\ndistrict to that of coal, and from the limestone to the sandstone,\r\nwith their varied scenery and their diversified aspects, will be\r\nnoticed; and Derbyshire, rich both in minerals beneath the surface and\r\nin arable, meadow, and pasture land on its face, as well as in rock,\r\nand tree, and wood, and hill, will be seen to great advantage. From\r\nChesterfield, too, the road is beautiful; and the visitor may make a\r\ndelightful “day’s round” by driving direct to Hardwick by way of Temple\r\nNormanton; Heath, with its truly picturesque and interesting church and\r\nparsonage; Ault Hucknall, in the church of which are many monuments\r\nof the Cavendish family, and where lies buried that sometime “world’s\r\nwonder,” “Hobbes of Malmesbury;” thence through the lodge-gates and\r\ndown the fine old deer-park to the Hall, and then returning by way of\r\nBolsover Castle, a magnificent old building, the former residence of\r\nthe Cavendishes, Earls and Dukes of Newcastle, and rendered famous in\r\nthe Duke of Newcastle’s work on horsemanship, 1658, and now for many\r\nyears the residence of Mrs. Hamilton Gray, the authoress of “Etruria.”\r\nBut from whatever side Hardwick is approached, the land is full of\r\nbeauty, and rich in the picturesque.\r\n\r\nHardwick Hall is one of the many princely seats—Chatsworth, Bolton\r\nAbbey, Lismore Castle, Holker Hall, Compton Place, Eastbourne, and\r\nDevonshire House, London, being among the others—of his Grace the\r\nDuke of Devonshire, in which resides the duke’s eldest son and heir,\r\nthe Marquis of Hartington, M.P., at this time Her Majesty’s Secretary\r\nof State for Ireland. It is distant from London about 140 miles,\r\nfrom Derby 20 miles, from Chesterfield 9, and from Matlock 15 miles,\r\nand these are perhaps the more general routes by which visitors will\r\nproceed. Whatever road is taken, they will find natural beauties in\r\nabundance greeting the eye at every mile of a delicious journey.\r\n\r\nBefore we describe the venerable Hall, we give a brief history of\r\nthe noble family to which it now belongs, reserving that of its\r\npredecessors for a later page.\r\n\r\nThe family of Cavendish, of which his Grace the present Duke of\r\nDevonshire, K.G., Lord Lieutenant of the county of Derby, is the\r\nrepresentative, traces back to the Conquest, when Robert de Gernon came\r\nover with the Conqueror, and so distinguished himself in arms that\r\nhe was rewarded with considerable grants of land in Hertfordshire,\r\nGloucestershire, &c. His descendants held considerable land in\r\nDerbyshire; and Sir William Gernon, who was one of the witnesses to\r\na confirmation charter of Henry III. to Basingdale Priory, obtained\r\na grant of a fair at Bakewell, in that county. He had two sons, Sir\r\nRalph de Gernon, lord of Bakewell, and Geoffrey de Gernon, of Moor\r\nHall, near Bakewell. From the second of these, Geoffrey de Gernon, the\r\nCavendishes are descended. His son, Roger de Gernon (who died 1334),\r\nmarried the heiress of John Potton, or Potkins, Lord of the Manor\r\nof Cavendish, in Suffolk, and by her had issue, four sons, who all\r\nassumed the name of Cavendish from their mother’s manor. These were\r\nSir John Cavendish, Chief Justice of the King’s Bench, in the time\r\nof Edward III., Chancellor of Cambridge, 4th of Richard II.; he was\r\nbeheaded by the insurgents of Suffolk in that reign; Roger Cavendish,\r\nfrom whom descended the celebrated navigator, Sir Thomas Cavendish;\r\nStephen Cavendish, Lord Mayor, member of Parliament, and Sheriff of\r\nLondon; and Richard Cavendish. Sir John married Alice, daughter of Sir\r\nJohn Odyngseles, Chief Justice of the King’s Bench, who brought to her\r\nhusband the manor of Cavendish Overhall, and by her, who died before\r\nhim, had issue, two sons, Andrew and John, and a daughter, Alice,\r\nmarried to William Nell. Sir Andrew Cavendish, the eldest son, was\r\nSheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk. By his wife, Rose, he left issue, one\r\nson, William, from whom the estates passed to his cousin. Sir Andrew\r\nwas succeeded by his brother, Sir John Cavendish, Esquire of the Body\r\nto Richard II. and Henry V., who, for his gallant conduct in killing\r\nthe rebel, Wat Tyler, in his conflict with Sir William Walworth, was\r\nknighted by Richard II. in Smithfield, and an annuity of £40 per annum\r\ngranted to him and his sons for ever. He was also made broiderer of\r\nthe wardrobe to the king. He married Joan, daughter of Sir William\r\nClopton, of Clopton, in Suffolk; and by her had issue, three sons,\r\nWilliam, his successor; Robert, Serjeant-at-Law; and Walter. William\r\nCavendish, who was a citizen and mercer of London, and of Cavendish\r\nOverhall, married Joan Staventon, by whom he had two sons, Thomas and\r\nWilliam. This Thomas Cavendish, who was of Cavendish and Pollingford,\r\nin Suffolk, married Katherine Scudamore, and left by her, as son and\r\nheir, Sir Thomas Cavendish, who, having studied the law, was employed\r\nby Thomas, Earl of Surrey, Treasurer of the King’s Exchequer. He was\r\nalso Clerk of the Pipe in the Exchequer to Henry VIII.—the office of\r\nthe Clerk of the Pipe being to make out leases of Crown lands, accounts\r\nof the sheriffs, &c. He married twice, and left, by his first wife,\r\nAlice, daughter and co-heir of John Smith, of Podbrooke Hall, besides\r\nother issue, three sons, George Cavendish, Sir William Cavendish, and\r\nSir Thomas Cavendish.\r\n\r\nGeorge Cavendish, the eldest of these three sons, was of Glemsford,\r\nand Cavendish Overhall, and is said to have been the author of\r\n“Cavendish’s Life of Wolsey,” although the authorship of that work\r\nis also attributed to his brother Sir William Cavendish. He received\r\na liberal education, and was endowed by his father with considerable\r\nlanded property in Suffolk. His character and learning seem to have\r\nrecommended him to the special notice of Cardinal Wolsey, who “took\r\nhim to be about his own person, as gentleman usher of his chamber, and\r\nplaced a special confidence in him.” George Cavendish was succeeded\r\nby his son William; the latter was succeeded by his son William, who\r\npassed away the manor of Cavendish Overhall to William Downes.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Cavendish was one of the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem,\r\nand died unmarried.\r\n\r\nSir William Cavendish, the second son of the first Sir Thomas, became\r\nthe founder of several noble families. He was married three times:\r\nfirst to a daughter of Edward Bostock, of Whatcross in Cheshire;\r\nsecondly, to a daughter of Sir Thomas Conyngsby, and widow of William\r\nParis; and thirdly, to Elizabeth, daughter of John Hardwick, of\r\nHardwick, and widow of Robert Barley, of Barley. He was “a man of\r\nlearning and business,” and was much employed in important affairs by\r\nhis sovereigns; filling the posts of Treasurer of the Chamber and Privy\r\nCouncillor to Henry VIII., Edward VI., and Mary. At the suppression\r\nof the religious houses under Henry VIII., he was “appointed one of\r\nthe Commissioners for visiting them, and afterwards was made one of\r\nthe auditors of the Court of Augmentation,” which was instituted\r\nfor the purpose of augmenting the revenues by the suppression of\r\nthe monasteries; for his services he received three valuable manors\r\nin Hertfordshire which, later on, he exchanged for other lands, in\r\nDerbyshire and other counties. He was also knighted by Henry VIII. By\r\nhis first wife he had issue, one son and two daughters who died young,\r\nand two other daughters, one of whom, Catherine, married Sir Thomas\r\nBrooke, son of Lord Cobham, and Anne, who married Sir Henry Baynton.\r\nBy his second wife he had three daughters, who all died young, and\r\nshe herself died in child-birth. By his third marriage, with “Bess\r\nof Hardwick,” he had a numerous family, viz.:—Henry Cavendish, of\r\nTutbury, Member of Parliament for Derbyshire, who married Grace,\r\ndaughter of George, Earl of Shrewsbury, but died without lawful issue;\r\nSir William Cavendish, created Earl of Devonshire, of whom hereafter;\r\nSir Charles Cavendish, of Bolsover Castle and of Welbeck Abbey (whose\r\nson, William Cavendish, by his first wife, was created Duke, Marquis,\r\nand Earl of Newcastle, Baron Ogle, Baron Cavendish, of Bolsover,\r\nViscount Mansfield, K.G., Commander-in-Chief, &c., &c., and was the\r\nauthor of the splendid work on Horsemanship, &c., and whose life was\r\ncharmingly written by his wife, Margaret Lucas, Maid of Honour to Queen\r\nHenrietta), ancestor of the Dukes of Newcastle, Portland, &c.; Frances,\r\nmarried to Sir Henry Pierrepoint, ancestor to the Dukes of Kingston;\r\nElizabeth, married to Charles Stuart, Duke of Lennox (younger brother\r\nof Lord Darnley, the husband of Mary, Queen of Scots, and father of\r\nKing James I.), the issue of which marriage was the sadly unfortunate\r\nlady, Arabella Stuart; and Mary, married to Gilbert, Earl of Shrewsbury.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The West Front._]\r\n\r\nSir William Cavendish was created Baron Cavendish, of Hardwick, and\r\nEarl of Devonshire, by King James I., “at which time of his creation,\r\nhis majesty stood under a cloth of state in the hall at Greenwich,\r\naccompanied with the princes, his children, the Duke of Holstein, the\r\nDuke of Lennox, and the greatest part of the nobility, both of England\r\nand Scotland.” His lordship was one of the first adventurers who\r\nsettled a colony and plantation in Virginia, and on the discovery of\r\nthe Bermuda Islands, he and others had a grant of them from the king,\r\none of the cantons being called after him. He married twice—his first\r\nwife being Anne, daughter of Henry Kighley, of Kighley, by whom he had\r\nissue, besides William, his successor, Gilbert, who died without issue;\r\nFrances, wife of Lord Maynard; and three others, who died in infancy:\r\nby his second wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Edward Boughton, and\r\nwidow of Sir Richard Wortley, he had a son, Sir John Cavendish. His\r\nlordship’s successor was his second son, Sir William (who had been\r\nunder the tuition of Thomas Hobbes, of whom more will be said on\r\nsubsequent pages); he married Christian, only daughter of Edward, Lord\r\nBruce, of Kinloss, a kinswoman of the king, “who gave her, with his own\r\nhand, and made her fortune ten thousand pounds.” By her he had three\r\nsons and one daughter, viz.:—William, his successor; Charles, who was\r\nLieutenant-General of Horse to his cousin the Earl of Newcastle, and\r\nwas slain at Gainsborough; Henry, who died young; and Anne, wife of\r\nLord Rich, eldest son of the Earl of Warwick.\r\n\r\nWilliam Cavendish, third Earl of Devonshire, was only ten years of age\r\nwhen his father died, and he was placed, as we have just said, under\r\nthe care of Hobbes, who travelled and remained with him, and was, for\r\nthe rest of his life, supported by the earl’s family. The earl married\r\nElizabeth Cecil, daughter of the Earl of Salisbury, by whom he had two\r\nsons, William (who succeeded him), Charles, and one daughter. William,\r\nfourth Earl of Devonshire, before succeeding to the title, sat in the\r\nLong Parliament for Derbyshire, and, as a youth, he was one of the\r\ntrain-bearers to the king at his coronation. He was among the principal\r\npersons who brought about the “Glorious Revolution” of 1688, and the\r\nplacing of William III. on the throne. He married Mary, daughter of the\r\nDuke of Ormonde, and had issue by her, William, his successor; Henry,\r\nJames, and Elizabeth. His lordship was the rebuilder of Chatsworth, and\r\nwas by William III. advanced to the dignity of Marquis of Hartington\r\nand Duke of Devonshire. He was succeeded in his titles and estates by\r\nhis son. His Grace died in 1707, and his funeral sermon, preached by\r\nWhite Kennett, Bishop of Peterborough, has been many times printed, and\r\nis attached to the memoirs of the family of Cavendish by that prelate.\r\n\r\nWilliam Cavendish, second Duke and fifth Earl of Devonshire, was\r\nCaptain of the Yeomen of the Guard, and succeeded to all his father’s\r\nappointments, among which were Lord Steward of the Household, Privy\r\nCouncillor, Lord Warden and Chief Justice in Eyre of all places north\r\nof the Trent, Lord-Lieutenant, K.G.; he was also constituted one of the\r\nregents of the kingdom. He married Rachel, daughter of William Lord\r\nRussell, and by her had issue, with several others, his successor,\r\nWilliam, who became third Duke of Devonshire, and married Catherine,\r\nheiress of John Hoskins, by whom he had a numerous family. His Grace\r\nheld many important posts in the State; among which were those of Lord\r\nLieutenant of Ireland, Lord Lieutenant of Derbyshire, Lord Keeper of\r\nthe Privy Seal, Lord Steward of the Household, and Lord Justiceship for\r\nthe administration of Government during his Majesty’s absence. He was\r\nsucceeded by his son—\r\n\r\nWilliam, fourth Duke of Devonshire, who was, during his father’s\r\nlifetime, called to the Upper House by his title, hitherto of courtesy,\r\nof Marquis of Hartington. He was appointed Master of the Horse and\r\na Privy Councillor. In 1754 he was one of the Lords of the Regency,\r\nand Governor of the County of Cork; in the following year he was Lord\r\nHigh Treasurer of Ireland; and in 1756 was Lord Lieutenant of Ireland,\r\nand First Commissioner of the Treasury. In 1757 he was Chamberlain of\r\nthe Household to the king, and held, besides, many other offices. His\r\nGrace married Charlotte, daughter, and ultimately heiress, of Richard\r\nBoyle, Earl of Burlington and Cork, by which union—the lady being\r\nBaroness Clifford in her own right—the Barony of Clifford came into\r\nthe Cavendish family. By this issue he had three sons and one daughter,\r\nviz.:—William, who succeeded him; Richard, who died unmarried; George\r\nAugustus Henry, created Earl of Burlington, from whom the present\r\nnoble representative of the House of Cavendish, the seventh Duke of\r\nDevonshire, is descended; and Dorothy, married to the Duke of Portland.\r\n\r\nWilliam, fifth Duke of Devonshire, the eldest son of the last named\r\npeer, was married twice: first, to the Lady Georgiana, daughter of\r\nEarl Spencer, one of the most accomplished and elegant women of the\r\ntime, and who is perhaps better known as “The Beautiful Duchess” than\r\nby any other name; and, secondly, to Lady Elizabeth Foster, daughter\r\nof the Earl of Bristol, and widow of John Thomas Foster, Esq. By the\r\n“Beautiful Duchess” his grace had issue, one son, William Spencer\r\nCavendish, who succeeded him, and two daughters: Georgiana, married to\r\nthe Earl of Carlisle; and Harriet Elizabeth, married to Earl Granville.\r\nOn his death, in 1811, the title and estates passed to his only son—\r\n\r\nWilliam Spencer Cavendish, sixth Duke and ninth Earl of Devonshire, one\r\nof the most liberal-minded of men and one of the most genuine patrons\r\nof Art and Literature. His Grace, whose career earned for him the\r\nproud title of “The good Duke”—a title which, with all his others,\r\nhas descended to his successor—was born in Paris in 1790, and besides\r\nholding office as Lord High Chamberlain, &c., went in a style of\r\nmore than princely splendour on an embassy to Russia from the British\r\nCourt, and so conducted that important mission as to gain exceeding\r\ndistinction and general applause. His Grace, who never married,\r\ndied in 1858, and was succeeded in his titles and estates—with the\r\nexception of the Barony of Clidord, which fell in abeyance between his\r\nsisters—by his second cousin, the present noble peer, who, as we have\r\nsaid, was grandson to the first Earl of Burlington, brother to the\r\nfifth duke.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Great Hall._]\r\n\r\nThe present peer, William Cavendish, Duke of Devonshire, Marquis of\r\nHartington, Earl of Devonshire, Earl of Burlington, Baron Cavendish\r\nof Hardwick, Baron Cavendish of Keighley, &c., &c., K.G., LL.D.,\r\nF.R.S., Lord Lieutenant and Custos Rotulorum of the County of Derby,\r\nChancellor of the University of Cambridge, Steward of the Borough\r\nof Derby, &c., &c., was born in 1808, and was educated at Eton, and\r\nat Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated as M.A., and was\r\nSecond Wrangler, Senior Smith’s Prizeman, and in the first class\r\nof the Classical Tripos, 1829. In the same year he became M.P. for\r\nthe University of Cambridge, which he held until 1831, when he\r\nwas returned for Malton, and afterwards for North Derbyshire, for\r\nwhich constituency he sat until he succeeded his father as Earl of\r\nBurlington, in 1834. In 1856 he was made Lord Lieutenant of Lancashire,\r\na post he held until 1858, when, on attaining to the Dukedom of\r\nDevonshire, he was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Derbyshire. From 1836\r\nto 1856 he was Chancellor of the University of London, and he has held,\r\nand still holds, several other important offices. In 1829 his Grace,\r\nthen Mr. Cavendish, married his cousin, the Lady Blanche Georgiana\r\nHoward, fourth daughter of George, sixth Earl of Carlisle, by the Lady\r\nGeorgiana Dorothy Cavendish, daughter of the fifth Duke of Devonshire.\r\nBy this truly estimable lady, who died in 1840, his Grace had surviving\r\nissue, three sons and one daughter, viz.:—Spencer Compton Cavendish,\r\nMarquis of Hartington; Lord Frederick Charles Cavendish, M.P. for\r\nthe West Riding of Yorkshire, Private Secretary to the Right Hon. W.\r\nE. Gladstone, married to the Hon. Lucy Caroline, daughter of Baron\r\nLyttelton; Lord Edward Cavendish, late M.P. for East Sussex, married to\r\nEmma, daughter of the late Hon. William Lascelles; and the Lady Louisa\r\nCavendish, married to Rear-Admiral the Hon. Francis Egerton, M.P. for\r\nEast Derbyshire, brother to the late, and uncle to the present, Earl of\r\nEllesmere.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis of Hartington, the heir to the titles and estates, was\r\nborn in 1833, and was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he\r\ngraduated as B.A. in 1852, M.A. in 1854, and LL.D. in 1862. He is a\r\nPrivy Councillor, and was Lord of the Admiralty in 1863, Undersecretary\r\nof State for War from 1863 to 1866; Secretary of State for War in 1866;\r\nand Postmaster-General from 1868 to 1871. He was attached to Lord\r\nGranville’s special mission to Russia in 1856, and has filled many\r\nimportant posts. His lordship, who is unmarried, is M.P. for Radnor,\r\nand is now Secretary of State for Ireland.\r\n\r\nLord George Henry Cavendish, brother to the Duke of Devonshire, is M.P.\r\nfor North Derbyshire, which constituency he has represented since the\r\nyear 1834. He married in 1835 the Lady Louisa, daughter of the Earl\r\nof Harewood. Lord Richard Cavendish, another brother of the duke, is\r\nunmarried.\r\n\r\nHis Grace is patron of thirty-nine livings, and in Derbyshire alone is\r\nLord of the Manor of forty-six places.\r\n\r\nThe arms of the duke are—_Sable_, three harts’ heads, caboshed,\r\n_argent_, attired _or_. Crest, a serpent, noued, _proper_. Supporters,\r\ntwo bucks, _proper_, each wreathed round the neck with a chaplet of\r\nroses, alternately _argent_ and _azure_.\r\n\r\nWe now, for the present, leave the genealogical part of our story to\r\nturn to the attractions of the interior of the Hall. Of the exterior\r\nand interior of the old hall and their surroundings we shall speak\r\nlater on.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Grand Staircase._]\r\n\r\nPassing through the entrance gateway, shown in one of our\r\nillustrations, the visitor to Hardwick will see before him, across\r\nthe quadrangular space laid out in magnificent flower-beds in the\r\npure Elizabethan style—the most striking feature of which are two\r\nimmense beds, one on either side the central pathway, formed in the\r\nshape of the letters E and S, the initials of Elizabeth, Countess of\r\nShrewsbury—in all its grandeur, the principal front of the Hall, which\r\nbears out to the full the truth of the common saying—\r\n\r\n  “Hardwick Hall,\r\n  More glass than wall.”\r\n\r\nThe house is in reality “all windows,” and has a peculiarity of\r\nappearance possessed by no other existing mansion. Passing under the\r\ncolonnade, seen in the centre of the building in our illustration on\r\npage 122, the visitor arrives at the entrance door, and will, before\r\nentering, do well to glance at an inscription, now nearly defaced, on\r\none of the pillars:—\r\n\r\n  “Hic locus est quem si verbis audacia detur\r\n  Haud meum magni dixisse palatia coeli,”\r\n\r\nwhich may be thus freely rendered:—\r\n\r\n  “Could any adventurous muse these portals sing,\r\n  No more to Heaven’s gate her flight she’d wing.”\r\n\r\nThe GREAT HALL, which is first entered, is of considerable magnitude,\r\nand very lofty, taking in the whole height of two stories of the noble\r\nbuilding. Its lower part is wainscoted; its upper, hung with fine\r\nGobelins tapestry. Along one side stands an enormous and massive oak\r\ntable, and carved chairs and seats in abundance are ranged around the\r\nroom. Over the entrance end a spacious gallery, supported on pillars,\r\nleads from the dining-room to the drawing-room, on the first floor; and\r\nat the opposite end is a charming piece of sculpture, a full-length\r\nstatue of Mary, Queen of Scots, by Westmacott, with the inscription—\r\n\r\n  “Maria Scotorum Regina\r\n          Nata 1542\r\n  A suis in exilium acta 1568\r\n  Ab hospita neci data 1587.”\r\n\r\nOn the wall over this is a large and very curious cartoon full-length\r\nfigure of Henry VIII. On the wainscot and in different parts of the\r\nhall are some fine antlers, a series of helmets and breastplates, and\r\nother relics; while over the fire-place, which is of great size and\r\nbeauty, and has its original brass fire-dogs, are the arms of the\r\nfoundress of the house, Elizabeth (Hardwick), Countess of Shrewsbury,\r\nof gigantic size, in raised plaster-work. Some remarks here seem\r\nrequisite concerning the heraldry of the place. The arms represented in\r\nthe great hall, and shown in our engraving of that splendid apartment,\r\nare _argent_, a saltire, engrailed, _azure_; on a chief of the second\r\nthree cinquefoils of the field. These, which are in a lozenge-shaped\r\nshield, are surmounted by an earl’s coronet, and have for supporters,\r\ntwo stags, _proper_, each gorged with a chaplet of roses, _argent_,\r\nbetween two bars _azure_. The arms are those of Hardwick of Hardwick,\r\nthe maiden name of the Countess; the supporters, which she had no\r\nright to assume, the family of Hardwick not being entitled to any,\r\nwere assumed from the crest of that family, which, with a slight\r\nvariation, formed those granted to her son, the first Baron Cavendish,\r\nof Hardwick, and Earl of Devonshire. The coronet is, of course, hers as\r\nCountess of Shrewsbury, the hall being built during the latter part of\r\nthe life of her _fourth_ husband, the Earl of Shrewsbury, and in the\r\nfirst nine years of her fourth widowhood. From the Great Hall a wide\r\npassage to the right leads to the grand staircase, the muniment-room,\r\nthe sitting and other rooms, on the ground-floor, and, to the left,\r\nto the kitchens and offices, and to another staircase. Ascending\r\nthese massive stone stairs hung with framed pieces of needlework and\r\nwith curious old paintings, some of which are dated 1576, and were\r\nprincipally brought from the old hall, an open oak screen-work on the\r\nlanding opens into\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Chapel._]\r\n\r\nTHE CHAPEL. In this truly interesting little room, the walls are\r\nnotable for being partly hung with painted tapestry of extremely good\r\ncharacter, and the only examples in the house. On the ceiling is a fine\r\npiece of tapestry, representing our Lord, with two of His disciples,\r\nblessing the bread. The pulpit is dressed with some of the earliest\r\nembroidery—portions of a cope, &c.; and on the rails hangs a very rich\r\nand curious altar-cloth, 80 feet long, with figures of saints under\r\ncanopies, wrought in very rich and early needlework. The chapel is\r\nshown in one of our illustrations. On the landing hangs a remarkably\r\ncurious lantern.\r\n\r\nOpposite to the chapel, a doorway opens into the DINING-ROOM, a noble\r\napartment, the lower part of the walls being wainscoted, and the\r\nupper hung with a number of family portraits, amongst which are an\r\ninteresting painting of “Bess of Hardwick,” with this inscription upon\r\nit:—“Elizabeth Hardwick, daughter and co-heir of John Hardwick, of\r\nHardwick, in the county of Derby. To her second husband, Sir William\r\nCavendish, of Chatsworth, in the same county. She settled her third\r\nson, Sir Charles Cavendish, at Welbeck, in the county of Nottingham.”\r\nOther portraits are those of her husband, Sir William Cavendish, at\r\nthe age of forty-four; “the Beautiful Duchess,” Georgiana, Duchess of\r\nDevonshire; the late Duke of Devonshire; Lord George Cavendish, second\r\nson of the third duke, known as “Truth and Daylight,” &c., &c. Over the\r\nfire-place is a fine specimen of parget-work, a kind of plaster-stone,\r\nwith figures, &c., and in the centre the inscription, “The conclusion\r\nof all things is to feare God and keepe his Commaundementes,” and the\r\nconjoined initials E.S. with the date 1597. The large recess of this\r\nroom is converted into a billiard-room.\r\n\r\nThe CUT-VELVET ROOM, leading from the dining-room, is a noble\r\napartment, hung with tapestry, and containing a stately bed with\r\nplumes. Over the fire-place, in parget-work, as in other rooms, is\r\na series of armorial bearings, among which again occur the arms of\r\nHardwick, with supporters and coronet. Adjoining this is a charming\r\ndressing-room, hung with the most exquisite needlework in silk. Passing\r\ndown the minstrels’ gallery from the dining-room to the drawing-room,\r\nsome fine specimens of needlework, by the Countess of Shrewsbury, and\r\nby Mary, Queen of Scots, are carefully preserved in frames.\r\n\r\nThe DRAWING-ROOM is a large well-proportioned apartment, the lower part\r\nof the walls wainscoted, and the upper hung with fine old tapestry,\r\nrepresenting the story of Esther and Ahasuerus. Over the fire-place\r\nare the arms of Hardwick, with quarterings, in a lozenge shield,\r\nsupporters, and coronet. Among the paintings will be specially noticed\r\na fine portrait of Arabella Stuart, several portraits by Holbein, and\r\nothers of Henry VII. and VIII., Edward VI., &c., &c. There are, also,\r\nsome curious pieces of needlework, framed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Presence Chamber._]\r\n\r\nFrom the drawing-room the DUKE’S BED ROOM, and other apartments,\r\nare reached. This room, so called because it is the room occupied\r\nby the late Duke of Devonshire, and in which he died, is a splendid\r\napartment, hung with tapestry representing scriptural subjects.\r\nOver the fire-place, which has large carved figures in stone on\r\neither side, is a fine piece of parget-work surrounding a painting.\r\nOn the bed a curious needlework counterpane invites attention. The\r\ndressing-room adjoining is one of the most interesting in the house.\r\nIt is hung with silk needlework tapestry of the finest and most choice\r\ncharacter, one piece of which bears the date of 1574. There are also\r\npaintings of the entombment of our Saviour, and of the Annunciation,\r\nwith the arms, in tapestry, of the Cavendishes, Talbots, and others.\r\nNear this room is the bed-room occupied, on his occasional visits to\r\nHardwick, by the present duke, on the tapestry of which cupids are\r\nrepresented playing at mall—the progenitor, apparently, of our modern\r\ncroquet. Near this, too, is the Marquis of Hartington’s room, in\r\nwhich are several interesting coats of arms in parget-work, including\r\nthe bearings of Hardwick, Cavendish, Talbot, and others. Returning\r\nthrough the drawing-room, the visitor next passes out to the GRAND\r\nSTAIRCASE, of which we give an engraving. Near the drawing-room door\r\nwill be noticed a fine old chest, said to have belonged to the Earl\r\nof Shrewsbury. The staircase is hung with some of the finest tapestry\r\nwhich any house can boast. One portion represents a classical story;\r\nthe boar-hunts and similar subjects are fine, and powerful in the\r\nextreme. On the second landing is an interesting inlaid table with the\r\narms of Hardwick impaling Talbot, and on the wall by it hangs some of\r\nthe oldest tapestry in the house. Continuing up the staircase, with\r\ntapestry on either side, the state-rooms are approached. The entrance\r\nis by a doorway surmounted by the Hardwick arms, over which is the most\r\ngorgeously fine piece of tapestry, representing Juno. On the door a\r\nmarvellously beautiful lock is still preserved. It, with the arms of\r\nHardwick, forms one of our initial letters. This door opens into the\r\n\r\nPRESENCE-CHAMBER, State-Room, or Audience-Room, as it is variously\r\ncalled. This splendid apartment, which is 65 feet long, 33 feet wide,\r\nand 26 feet in height, is one of the finest proportioned and most\r\nimposing in appearance even in this perfect house. The upper portion\r\nof the walls of this magnificent chamber is covered with parget-work\r\nin high coloured-relief, representing hunting scenes, Orpheus, and the\r\ncourt of Diana. Below this, for full 15 feet in height, the walls are\r\nhung with tapestry of the finest character.\r\n\r\nOver the fire-place of this room are the arms and supporters of Queen\r\nElizabeth, in coloured relief parget-work. The furniture is remarkably\r\nfine, as will be seen from our engraving of this room. At the north\r\nend is a majestic canopy, decorated in minute needlework with figures\r\nof the cardinal virtues, “Verecundia,” “Prudentia,” “Sobrietas,”\r\n&c., alternating with monograms and arms of the family. Under the\r\ncanopy is a state-chair; and in front, one of the most curious and\r\ninteresting tables in existence. It is of large size, and elaborately\r\ninlaid over the entire surface of its top with musical instruments of\r\nvarious kinds, backgammon and chess boards, cards, and various games,\r\nfoliage and other devices. In its centre is a tablet with the quaint\r\ninscription:—\r\n\r\n  THE REDOLENT SMLE\r\n  OF ÆGLENTYNE\r\n  WE STAGGES EXAVLT\r\n  TO THE DEVEYNE.\r\n\r\nThe “stagges” being, no doubt, the stags of the Hardwick arms. On\r\neach side of the tablet are the arms of Hardwick and Talbot impaled,\r\n&c. From this room a doorway in the tapestry opens into the\r\npicture-gallery, and another at the north end leads into the LIBRARY,\r\nover the chimney-piece of which is a splendid piece of sculpture,\r\nApollo and the Muses; over the figures on one side are the arms of\r\nQueen Elizabeth, and on the other her initials, E. R., in a knot, and\r\ncrowned. This fine group, found not many years ago in a case in one of\r\nthe servants’ rooms at Chatsworth, is supposed to have been presented\r\nto the countess by Queen Elizabeth, and it has, therefore, been most\r\nappropriately brought and placed in its present position. In this\r\nroom, among other interesting pictures, is a portrait of James V. of\r\nScotland, when very young. It belonged to Queen Mary, and was taken\r\nwith her from place to place. Passing through the library and the GREEN\r\nBED-ROOM, where the majestic state-bed and the tapestry are sure to\r\nexcite attention, one of the most interesting little rooms in the whole\r\nbuilding is gained:—\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Mary Queen of Scots’ Room._]\r\n\r\nMARY QUEEN OF SCOTS’ ROOM—a room which, it appears to us, the Countess\r\nof Shrewsbury prepared expressly for the reception of the furniture\r\nused by the truly unfortunate captive who had for so many years been a\r\nprisoner in charge of her and her husband, and in which, when finished,\r\nshe placed her bed and other furniture, so as to preserve them as\r\nprecious relics. On the panels of the wainscoting of the room are the\r\ninitials of the countess, E.S., with the coronet and the date 1599;\r\nand on the door the same date twice occurs. The woodwork is “tricked”\r\nin arabesque patterns; over the door, on the interior side, are carved\r\nthe royal arms of Scotland, with the order of St. Andrew, supporters,\r\ncrown, &c., and the letters M. S., and the motto, IN · MY · DE · FENS.\r\nAround the whole is the inscription, MARIE · STEWART · PAR · LA · GRACE\r\n· DE · DIEV · ROYNE · DE · SCOSSE · DOVARIERE · DE · FRANCE. Over the\r\nfire-place, in parget-work, are the arms of Hardwick in lozenge, with\r\ncoronet and supporters; the arms of Hardwick impaling Leake; and those\r\nof Cavendish, with a crescent for difference, impaling _argent_ a fesse\r\n_gules_. The bed—the very one in which the poor queen lay during a\r\npart of her captivity—is adorned with the work of her own hands,\r\nbearing her monogram. The counterpane, too, is an elaborate piece of\r\nneedlework, said to be her own work; and some of the furniture is of\r\nthe same period. We have engraved this historically interesting room as\r\none of our illustrations.\r\n\r\nNear this is the BLUE BED-ROOM, hung with tapestry, and containing a\r\nnoble bed, hung with blue, to which needlework by Christian Bruce,\r\nCountess of Devonshire, has been transferred with much judgment and\r\ncare. Over the chimney-piece is the “Marriage of Tobias.” Other\r\nbed-rooms adjoin, which it is not necessary to notice.\r\n\r\nThe PICTURE-GALLERY, the “great glory” of Hardwick, occupies the\r\nentire length of the building from north to south, on the upper floor\r\nof its eastern front. Its length is 170 feet, and its width 40 feet,\r\nincluding the recessed windows; its height being 26 feet. The walls\r\nof this superb gallery are hung with the finest tapestry, almost\r\nhidden, however, by the magnificent assemblage of portraits with\r\nwhich it is, as will be seen from our engraving, literally covered.\r\nThe tapestry here is, as has been said, remarkably fine, and is very\r\nearly, some of it bearing the date of 1478. It was brought from the old\r\nmansion and from Chatsworth. The gallery is lit by eighteen enormous\r\nwindows, each 20 feet in height, on its eastern side, which is deeply\r\nrecessed. In the centre of this side is a gorgeous canopy over the\r\nstate seat, bearing the monogram of W.D., with a coronet; and on the\r\nwestern side are two gigantic chimney-pieces, reaching from the floor\r\nto the cornice, composed of Derbyshire black marble, alabaster, and\r\nother marbles, one bearing in the centre of its upper height a finely\r\nsculptured figure of Pity, and the other that of Justice. They are\r\nsaid to be the work of “Stephens, a Flemish sculptor, or of Valerio\r\nVicentino.” The ceiling is of geometric design, in raised plaster-work;\r\nit gives that finish to the room which is wanting in other of the\r\napartments. The upper portion of the walls, above the wainscoting and\r\narras, is worked in panels and festoons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Picture-Gallery._]\r\n\r\nThe furniture is of the most costly and curious character, and in\r\nperfect preservation. Much of it, indeed, belongs to the time, or to a\r\ntime not much later, when the house was constructed, and indicates the\r\nartistic feeling and manual dexterity of the foundress. Here are beds\r\nof state, with their curtains of black and silver; Venetian velvets and\r\ndamascenes; “cloth of Raynes to slepe on softe,” and hangings “raied\r\nwith gold;” hard cushions of blue baudekyn; high-seated chairs, covered\r\nwith samit and powdered with flowers, yet most uncomfortable for use;\r\nscreens of crimson velvet, covered with patterns worked in silver\r\nwires; couches, every portion of which is thickly overlaid with threads\r\nof silver and of gold; tables with legs twisted and turned about\r\nin the most picturesque manner; fire-dogs of gorgeous description;\r\nand a magnificent giant-glass, with the arms of Devonshire impaling\r\nOrmonde—these are among the beauties which greet the eye at every\r\nturn in its progress through Hardwick.\r\n\r\nAs we said at the commencement of this chapter, there is no place so\r\nlikely as Hardwick to carry the mind back to those times which we have\r\nindicated and to which it belongs. One is unresistingly and forcibly\r\ncarried by the imagination back to the time of Elizabeth, and while\r\npacing along through these rooms, we are led, “in the mind’s eye,” to\r\npeople them with the forms of those who lived and moved and had their\r\nbeing within its walls.\r\n\r\nTo the paintings in the picture-gallery and those scattered through the\r\nseveral rooms, the dining-room more especially, we can but make slight\r\nreference. They count some hundreds of the finest and most historically\r\ninteresting portraits of which any mansion can boast. To enumerate them\r\nwould occupy a dozen of our pages: we must, therefore, be content to\r\nsay that among them are original portraits of Queen Elizabeth; of Mary,\r\nQueen of Scots; of Elizabeth, Queen of Bohemia; of Arabella Stuart; of\r\nthe foundress of the building, “Bess of Hardwick,” afterwards Countess\r\nof Shrewsbury; of Kings Henry VII. and Henry VIII.; of Georgiana, the\r\n“Beautiful Duchess” of Devonshire; of Robert Boyle, the philosopher; of\r\nthe seventh and unfortunate Earl of Derby; of Lord Treasurer Burleigh;\r\nof Queen Mary; of Sir William St. Loe, third husband of “Bess of\r\nHardwick;” of George, sixth Earl of Shrewsbury; of Henry VII. and Henry\r\nVIII., cartoons by Holbein; of James V. of Scotland, and his queen; of\r\nGilbert, Earl of Shrewsbury; of Mary, Countess of Shrewsbury; of Lady\r\nGrace Talbot; of several distinguished members of the Clifford family;\r\nof Queen Catherine of Arragon; of Christian, Countess of Devonshire;\r\nof Lady Jane Seymour; of Elizabeth, Countess of Devonshire; of the\r\nfirst Duke of Ormond; of Rachel, Duchess of Devonshire; of Edward\r\nRussell, Duke of Bedford; of John, first Duke of Rutland; of Henry\r\nFitzalan, Earl of Arundel; of William, Lord Russell; of the Marchioness\r\nof Hartington; of Queen Anne; of Frederick, Prince of Wales; of King\r\nWilliam III.; of King George III.; of King James I.; of Sir Robert\r\nWalpole; of Francis Bacon, Lord Verulam; of the Princess of Orange; and\r\nof most of the noted men of the time; of numerous celebrities of the\r\nCavendish family and their alliances; and of Thomas Hobbes—“Leviathan\r\nHobbes,” or “Hobbes of Malmesbury,” as he is called.\r\n\r\nFrom the leads of Hardwick Hall, which are gained by a spacious\r\nstaircase, the upper rooms of the towers are reached, and a magnificent\r\nview of the surrounding country is obtained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHaving described HARDWICK HALL as it now exists, and given a brief\r\nhistory of the noble family of Cavendish to whom it belongs, we\r\nresume the subject, to speak of the older mansion, now in ruins; of\r\nthe Hardwicks to whom it belonged; of the marvellous daughter of that\r\nhouse, “Bess of Hardwick,” and her alliances; and of AULT HUCKNALL, the\r\nparish church, and its many monuments, among which is that to the great\r\nphilosopher, “Hobbes of Malmesbury,” who lived and died at Hardwick.\r\n\r\nAnd, first, as to the family.\r\n\r\nThe family of Hardwick is one of considerable antiquity in the county\r\nof Derby, although now extinct, and was for several generations settled\r\nat Hardwick, from which place, indeed, it is probable the name was\r\nassumed.\r\n\r\nIn 1203 the manor of Hardwick was granted by King John to Andrew de\r\nBeauchamp, but in 1288 it was held of John le Savage—who owned the\r\nneighbouring manor of Steynsby, and was probably of the same family\r\nas the later Savages, of Castleton and other places—by William de\r\nSteynsby, by the annual render of _three pounds of cinnamon and one\r\npound of pepper_. The grandson of William de Steynsby, John Steynsby,\r\ndied seized of the manor in 1330. It afterwards passed into the\r\nhands of the Hardwicks, and was held by them until it passed to the\r\nCavendishes by the marriage of the heiress to Sir William Cavendish.\r\nThe first of the Hardwick family known was William, who married the\r\ndaughter of Goushill, of Barlborough (which family of Goushill, in\r\nthe time of Henry III., married the heiress of Hathersage, and whose\r\nheiress, in the sixteenth century, married Wingfield), and by her had\r\ntwo sons, Roger and William, the latter of whom was living in the\r\nthirty-second year of Henry VI. Roger Hardwick, of Hardwick, married\r\nthe daughter of Robert Barley, of Barley, and had issue by her, John,\r\nwho succeeded him. John Hardwick, of Hardwick, married Elizabeth,\r\ndaughter of Henry Bakewell, of Bakewell, one of the co-heiresses of\r\nwhich family married Linacre before the year 1400. By her he had\r\nissue, a son, John Hardwick, who, marrying Elizabeth, daughter of —\r\nPinchbeck, of Pinchbeck, was, in turn, succeeded by his son, John\r\nHardwick, who married Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Leake, of Hasland,\r\na younger branch of the Leakes, Earls of Scarsdale. By this lady\r\nJohn Hardwick, who died January 24, 1527, had issue, one son and four\r\ndaughters, viz., John, Mary, Elizabeth, Alice, and Jane. John Hardwick,\r\nthe last male representative of the family, who was only three years\r\nold at his father’s death, married Elizabeth, daughter of Philip\r\nDraycott, of Paynsley, but died without issue, leaving his sisters his\r\nco-heiresses. Of these, Mary married, first, Wingfield, and, second,\r\none of the Pollards, of Devonshire, who was Gentleman Usher to the\r\nQueen; Alice married Francis Leech, of Chatsworth, and died without\r\nissue; Jane married Godfrey Bosville of Gunthwaite; and Elizabeth\r\n(“Bess of Hardwick”) married, first, Robert Barley, of Barley; second,\r\nSir William Cavendish; third, Sir William St. Loe; and fourth, Gilbert,\r\nEarl of Shrewsbury. The Francis Leech just named, who married “Bess’s”\r\nsister Alice, was the last of his family. He sold Chatsworth to Agard,\r\nwho resold it to the second husband of “Bess,” Sir William Cavendish,\r\nby whom it was rebuilt in almost regal magnificence.\r\n\r\nElizabeth Hardwick was, it will have been seen, one of the co-heiresses\r\nof her father, and ultimately heiress to her brother, from whom she\r\ninherited Hardwick and other estates. She was a most remarkable,\r\nclever, and accomplished woman, and one of the most successful, in her\r\nmany marriages, in her acquisition of property, in the alliances of her\r\nfamily, and in the erection of magnificent mansions; and no account\r\nof Hardwick would be complete without, at all events, a brief notice\r\nof her extraordinary and brilliant career. When very young—indeed,\r\nit is said, when scarcely fourteen years of age—Elizabeth Hardwick\r\nbecame the wife of Robert Barley, of Barley (or Barlow), in the\r\ncounty of Derby, son of Arthur Barley, of Barley-by-Dronfield, by his\r\nwife, Elizabeth Chaworth. This young gentleman, who was devotedly\r\nattached to his young and charming wife, died within a few months\r\nafter their marriage, leaving his possessions to her. By this short\r\nmarriage there was no issue. Remaining a young, indeed childlike, widow\r\nfor some twelve years or thereabouts, she then married Sir William\r\nCavendish, as detailed in our former chapter, and so brought to him\r\nthe possessions of the Hardwicks, which she had inherited from her\r\nfather and brother, as well as those of the Barleys, acquired by her\r\nfirst marriage. By Sir William Cavendish she had a family of three\r\nsons and three daughters, viz., Henry Cavendish, of Tutbury, ancestor\r\nof the Barons Waterpark; Sir William Cavendish, of Chatsworth, created\r\nBaron Cavendish of Hardwick, and Earl of Devonshire, and ancestor\r\nof the present Ducal house of Devonshire; Sir Charles Cavendish, of\r\nBolsover Castle, ancestor of the Barons Cavendish, Viscounts Mansfield,\r\nEarls, Marquises, and Dukes of Newcastle; Frances, wife of the Duke of\r\nKingston; Elizabeth, wife of Charles Stuart, Duke of Lennox, and mother\r\nby him of Arabella Stuart; and Mary, wife of Gilbert, seventh Earl of\r\nShrewsbury.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Hardwick Hall, from the Park._]\r\n\r\nSir William Cavendish died in 1557, and his lady was thus a second time\r\nleft a widow. A few years later she married her third husband, Sir\r\nWilliam St. Loe, Captain of the Guard to Queen Elizabeth, “owner of a\r\ngreat estate, which,” as Bishop Kennett says, “in articles of marriage\r\nshe took care should be settled on her and her own heirs, in default of\r\nissue; and, accordingly, having no child by him, she liv’d to enjoy his\r\nwhole estate, excluding his former daughters and brothers;” thus adding\r\nhis property to the already immense possessions she had acquired in her\r\nown right and by her two former marriages. The death of Sir William\r\nleft her for the third time a widow; but she was soon after wooed and\r\nwon by George, sixth Earl of Shrewsbury, who had not long before lost\r\nhis countess, Gertrude Manners, daughter of the Earl of Rutland. Before\r\nshe would consent, however, to be united to the first peer of the\r\nrealm, she stipulated that he should give his daughter to her eldest\r\nson, and that Gilbert Talbot, his second son (the eldest being already\r\nmarried) should espouse her youngest daughter. These family nuptials\r\nwere solemnised at Sheffield on the 9th of February, 1567-8; her\r\ndaughter being at the time not quite twelve years old, and her husband\r\nbeing under fifteen. Gilbert Talbot became seventh Earl of Shrewsbury.\r\n\r\nThe history of the events of her life while Countess of Shrewsbury\r\nis that of the kingdom at large; for it was during this time, from\r\n1568 to 1584, that Mary, Queen of Scots, was confided to the care of\r\nthe earl and his lady, and by them was kept a close prisoner. Into\r\nthese annals—known by every student of English history—it is not our\r\nprovince now to enter. Suffice it to say, that the wearisome task,\r\nimposed by a rigorous and arbitrary sovereign, was executed with a\r\nzeal and with a diligence that were worthy a far better cause. In 1568\r\nthe earl received from his royal mistress the intimation of the trust\r\nshe was about to confide to him, and on the 20th of the following\r\nJanuary, 1569, the order for removing Mary from Bolton to Tutbury was\r\nmade. Here the poor captive was received by the Earl and Countess of\r\nShrewsbury; and here, kept a close prisoner, she remained for several\r\nmonths, passing her time as best she might in needlework. “I asked\r\nhir grace,” says White, “sence the wether did cutt of all exercises\r\nabrode, howe passed the tyme within? She sayd that all the day she\r\nwrought with hir nydill, and that the diversitie of the colours made\r\nthe worke seme lesse tedious, and contynued so long at it till veray\r\npayn made hir to give over; and with that layd hir hand upon hir left\r\nsyde and complayned of an old grief newely increased there.” In June\r\nthe earl removed her to Wingfield Manor, in Derbyshire, now, like\r\nTutbury itself, a splendid ruin; and later on in the same year back\r\nagain to Tutbury. In 1570 Mary was removed to Chatsworth, and from\r\nthence to Sheffield, also now a ruin. Here she remained, occasionally\r\nstaying at Chatsworth for some length of time. In 1584 she was again\r\nremoved to Wingfield, in 1585 to Tutbury, and in the following year to\r\nChartley, to Fotheringhay, and that fatal block, which will ever remain\r\na dark blot on the escutcheon of “good Queen Bess.” It is a somewhat\r\nremarkable circumstance, touching the captivity of Mary under the\r\nconstableship of the Earl of Shrewsbury, that the places belonging to\r\nhim where she was confined, Sheffield Castle and Manor, Tutbury Castle,\r\nWingfield Manor, and Chartley (as well as Fotheringhay, where she was\r\nexecuted), have all fallen to ruin, while Chatsworth and other places\r\nwhich belonged to the countess still flourish.\r\n\r\nIt is not certain, although there is every probability that such was\r\nthe case, that Mary was ever at Hardwick. There can be but little doubt\r\nshe spent, at all events, a few days there; but this would, of course,\r\nbe at the old Hall, as will be shown later on.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Shrewsbury, about whom strange rumours regarding his\r\nconduct and intentions towards his captive at the time of his\r\ndischarge from his trust were afloat, and over whom a female domestic,\r\nEleanor Britton, had gained an injurious ascendency, afterwards, in\r\nconsequence, living a not very happy life with his second countess,\r\ndied in 1590; and thus “Bess of Hardwick” became, for the fourth time,\r\na widow. “A change of conditions,” says Bishop Kennett, “that, perhaps,\r\nnever fell to the lot of one woman, to be four times a creditable and\r\nhappy wife, to rise by every husband into greater wealth and higher\r\nhonours, to have a numerous issue by one husband only; to have all\r\nthose children live, and all, by her advice, be creditably disposed of\r\nin her lifetime; and, after all, to live seventeen years a widow in\r\nabsolute power and plenty.”\r\n\r\nThe countess, besides being one of the most beautiful, accomplished,\r\nand captivating women of her day, was, without exception, the most\r\nenergetic, business-like, and able of her sex. In architecture her\r\nconceptions were grand; while in all matters pertaining to the Arts,\r\nand to comforts and elegancies of life, she was unsurpassed. To\r\nthe old Hall of her fathers, where she was born and resided, she\r\nmade vast additions—indeed, so much so as almost to amount to a\r\nrecreation of the place; and she entirely planned and built three of\r\nthe most gorgeous edifices of the time—Hardwick Hall, Chatsworth, and\r\nOldcotes—the first two of which were transmitted entire to the first\r\nDuke of Devonshire. “At Hardwick she left the ancient seat of her\r\nfamily standing, and at a small distance, still adjoining to her new\r\nfabric, _as if she had a mind to preserve her Cradle, and set it by her\r\nBed of State_,” as Kennett so poetically expresses it.\r\n\r\nHer “Bed of State”—the present Hall, erected by her—we have already\r\ndescribed. Her “Cradle”—the old Hall, wherein she was born and nursed,\r\nbut which is now in ruins—we shall describe presently.\r\n\r\nThe latter part of her long and busy life she occupied almost entirely\r\nin building, and it is marvellous what an amount of real work—hard\r\nfigures and dry details—she got through; for it is a fact, abundantly\r\nevidenced by the original accounts, remaining to this day, that not a\r\npenny was expended on her buildings, and not a detail added or taken\r\naway, without her special attention and personal supervision. Building\r\nwas a passion with her, and she indulged it wisely and well, sparing\r\nneither time, nor trouble, nor outlay, to secure everything being done\r\nin the most admirable manner. It is said, and it is so recorded by\r\nWalpole, that the countess had once been told by a gipsy fortune-teller\r\nthat she would never die so long as she continued building, and she so\r\nimplicitly believed this, that she never ceased planning and contriving\r\nand adding to her erections; and it is said that at last she died in a\r\nhard frost, which totally prevented the workmen from continuing their\r\nlabours, and so caused an unavoidable suspension of her works. Surely\r\nthe fortune-teller here was a “wise woman” in more senses than one;\r\nfor it was wise and cunning in her to instil such a belief into the\r\ncountess’s mind, and thus insure a continuance of the works by which so\r\nmany workmen and their families gained a livelihood, and by which later\r\ngenerations would also benefit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Old Hall at Hardwick._]\r\n\r\nBesides Hardwick, Chatsworth (for which a good part of the old Hall at\r\nHardwick was, at a later period, removed), Oldcotes, and other places,\r\nthe countess founded and built the Devonshire Almshouses at Derby, and\r\ndid many other good and noble works. She died, full of years and full\r\nof honours and riches, on the 23rd of February, 1607, and was buried in\r\nAll Saints’ Church, Derby, under a stately tomb which she had erected\r\nduring her lifetime, and on which a long Latin inscription is to be\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nOf the countess—the “Bess of Hardwick,” who was one of the greatest\r\nof the subjects of that other “Bess” who sat on the throne of\r\nEngland—portraits are still preserved at Hardwick, and show that she\r\nmust have been, as Dugdale says of her, “faire and beautiful.” Whatever\r\nfaults of temper or of disposition she had—and she is said to have\r\nhad plenty of both—she had good qualities which, perhaps, outbalanced\r\nthem; and she, at all events, founded one of the most brilliant\r\nhouses—that of Cavendish—which this nation has ever produced.\r\n\r\nThe old Hall at Hardwick, of the ruins of which we give an engraving,\r\nwas, in its palmy days, a place of considerable extent and beauty,\r\nand from its charming situation—being built on the edge of a rocky\r\neminence overlooking an immense tract of country—must have been a most\r\ndesirable residence. In it a long line of the ancestors of the countess\r\nwere born, and lived, and died; and in it she too was born and lived,\r\nas maiden, as four times wife, and four times widow. In it, if Mary,\r\nQueen of Scots, was ever at Hardwick, she must have been received, and\r\nin it the larger part of the great works of its remarkable owner must\r\nhave been planned. It was her “home,” and her favourite residence; and\r\nit is said that when she began to build the new Hall—which, as we have\r\nsaid, closely adjoins the old one—she still intended making the older\r\nbuilding her abode, and keeping the new one for state receptions and\r\npurposes of hospitality. This plan, however, if ever laid down, was\r\nultimately discarded, and the old mansion, after all the improvements\r\nwhich had been made in it, was in great measure stripped and dismantled\r\nfor the requirements of the new Hall, and of Chatsworth.\r\n\r\nA tolerably good idea of the extent of the ruins of the old Hall will\r\nbe gained from our engraving, which shows, perhaps, its most imposing\r\nside, with the green sward in front. In its interior, several rooms,\r\nin a more or less state of dilapidation, still remain, and can be\r\nseen by the visitor. The kitchens, with their wide chimneys, and the\r\ndomestic offices on the ground-floor, amply testify to the almost regal\r\nhospitality which must at one time have characterized the place; while\r\nthe chambers, the state-rooms, and the other apartments for the family,\r\ntestify to the magnificence of its appointments.\r\n\r\nThe principal remaining apartment—and of this we give an\r\nillustration—is at the top of that portion of the building which\r\noverlooks the valley. It is called the “Giants’ Chamber,” taking its\r\nname from the two colossal figures in Roman armour, which they term\r\n_Gog_ and _Magog_, in raised plaster-work over the fire-place. This\r\npargetting is bold in the extreme, and in very high relief, and the two\r\nfigures, between which is a remarkably free and artistic winged figure\r\nwith a bow, must have had a wondrous effect as they frowned down upon\r\nthe gay throng assembled in olden times on the rush-strewn floors. The\r\nroom, which has been wainscoted, is 55 feet 6 inches in length, 30 feet\r\n6 inches in width, and 24 feet 6 inches in height; and of it Bishop\r\nKennett thus speaks: “That old house has one room in it of such exact\r\nproportion, and such convenient lights, that it has been thought fit\r\nfor a pattern of measure and contrivance to the most noble Blenheim.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Interior of the Old Hall._]\r\n\r\nIn other apartments, pargetting of the same general character as\r\ndistinguishes the rooms in Hardwick Hall itself is to be seen over\r\nthe fire-places. In one place a figure or two; in another, animals of\r\nthe chase; in a third, a moated and fortified building; in another,\r\narmorial bearings; and in yet another, the same motto—now from the\r\ndangerous state of the walls and floors not discernible—which occurs\r\non the fine old table described in our last—\r\n\r\n  “The redolent smell of eglantyne\r\n  We stagges exault to the devyne”—\r\n\r\nwill be noticed, and all of the highest order of workmanship. Of the\r\nmoated and fortified building just alluded to, we give an engraving\r\non our initial letter, and beneath it, we have added the arms of the\r\npresent noble house of Cavendish.\r\n\r\nWe have, on a previous page, spoken of the marvellous aptitude for\r\nbusiness, and the careful attention to even the minutest details of\r\nexpenditure, &c., evinced by the Countess of Shrewsbury, and we purpose\r\nnow to make this a little more evident by giving some particulars of\r\nthe erection of Hardwick Hall built by her.\r\n\r\nThe Hall, as it now stands—for it is, in every essential part, just\r\nas the countess left it—was, it is thought, commenced about the year\r\n1576, and finished in 1599. The book of accounts of the wages paid is\r\nvery curious and interesting, and gives the names of all the various\r\nwallers, ditchers, stone breakers, labourers, &c., with the gardeners,\r\nthatchers, moss-getters, &c., employed by the countess between January,\r\n1576, and December, 1580. The accounts are made up every fortnight\r\nduring that time, and all the items are carefully ticked off with a\r\ncross by the countess, and each fortnight’s accounts signed by her. Of\r\none of the signatures we have engraved a fac-simile: it reads—“thre\r\nponde hyght pence. E. SHROUESBURY.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOf the items of which this fortnight’s accounts, amounting only to £3\r\n0_s._ 8_d._ are composed, we copy the following:—\r\n\r\n “This fortnight work begane one Munday beinge the xxjth of January,\r\n viz.:—\r\n\r\n  George Hickete       xj days      v_s._ vj_d._\r\n  his mane             xj days      iij_s._. viij_d._\r\n  and his boy          xj days      iij_s._ viij_d._\r\n  Robert bucknail      vj days      ij_s._\r\n  his mane             vj days      xviij_d._”\r\n\r\nIn the park are some remarkably fine old oak and other forest trees,\r\nround which almost countless herds of deer may be seen browsing. Some\r\nof these trees are of gigantic size, of considerable girth, and of\r\ngreat beauty. Our engraving on page 139 gives a distant view of the\r\nHall, with some of these fine trees in the foreground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Hault Hucknall Church._]\r\n\r\nHAULT HUCKNALL (Haute Hucknall, as it is called in the early registers,\r\nand Ault Hucknall, as it is now not unfrequently spelt) is the\r\nparish in which Hardwick Hall stands; and it is therefore necessary,\r\nespecially as the two places are intimately connected in more ways than\r\none, to say a few words about its church and monuments. The church,\r\nwhich is dedicated to St. John the Baptist, formerly belonged to the\r\nAbbey of Beauchief, but was, with the impropriate rectory, granted\r\nin 1544 to Francis Leake, from whom it passed to the Cavendishes, and\r\nnow belongs to the Marquis of Hartington. The church contains some\r\ninteresting remains of Norman and of Early English work, among which\r\nare the aisle under the tower, the window in the west end of the north\r\naisle, and the old plain font,—the font now in use having been brought\r\nhere from Bamford Church in the same county. In the south wall of the\r\nchancel is a pretty little piscina, and there are aumbries in the north\r\naisle and in the Hardwick Chapel. At these places it is supposed altars\r\nformerly stood, and one of the altar-stones, with the five crosses\r\nemblematic of the five wounds of our Saviour, may be seen forming one\r\nof the paving-stones of the floor near the altar-rails. The porch has a\r\nvaulted stone-roof, and in the nave are remains of wall-paintings.\r\n\r\nSome portions of an elegant carved-oak screen which formerly separated\r\nthe Hardwick Chapel from the south aisle are still preserved, as are\r\nalso several of the original massive oak benches. In the east window\r\nof the Hardwick Chapel, as shown in our engraving, the stained glass\r\nrepresents our Saviour on the cross, with the figures of the Virgin\r\nMary and of St. John, &c. There are also some kneeling figures, and the\r\narms of Hardwick and of Savage.\r\n\r\nAmong the monuments in this interesting church are some deserving\r\nespecial attention. In the floor of the chancel is a monumental brass,\r\nthe figure belonging to which is unfortunately lost, commemorative\r\nof Richard Pawson, 1536, sometime vicar of the parish, bearing the\r\nfollowing inscription in black letter:—\r\n\r\n    “Orate pro aia domini Ricardi Pawson Vicarii\r\n  Istius qui obiit die qua Vocavit eū d̄ns post an̄m\r\n  d̄ni millesimum quingentesimū tricesimū sextum\r\n  cujus aiē ppicietur deus. A.”\r\n\r\nAt the east end of the Hardwick Chapel, beneath the window, as shown\r\nin the engraving on the next page, is an elegant tomb, of Derbyshire\r\nmarble, to the memory of Anne, daughter and co-heiress of Henry\r\nKighley, of Kighley, in Yorkshire, and first wife of the second Sir\r\nWilliam Cavendish, created, after her death, Baron Cavendish of\r\nHardwick, and Earl of Devonshire. She was the mother of William, second\r\nEarl of Devonshire, and Gilbert Cavendish, author of “Horæ Subsecivæ,”\r\nFrances, wife of Lord Maynard, and James, Mary, and Elizabeth, who all\r\ndied young.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting tomb, however, in this pretty church, is that of\r\nThomas Hobbes, who is best known as “Hobbes, of Malmesbury,” or as\r\n“Leviathan Hobbes.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Grave of Hobbes of Malmesbury in Hault Hucknall\r\nChurch._]\r\n\r\nThe monument to this great “philosopher” and free-thinker is a plain\r\nslab of stone in the Hardwick Chapel—the raised slab shown on the\r\nfloor in this engraving—which bears the following inscription:—\r\n\r\n  CONDITA HIC SUNT OSSA\r\n  THOMÆ HOBBES,\r\n  MALMESBURIENSIS,\r\n  QVI PER MULTOS ANNOS SERVIVIT\r\n  DUOBUS DEVONIÆ COMITIBUS\r\n  PATRI ET FILIO\r\n  VIR PROBUS, ET FAMA ERUDITIONIS\r\n  DOMI FORISQUE BENE COGNITUS\r\n  OBIIT ANN^o DOMINI 1679,\r\n  MENSIS DECEMBRIS DIE 4º\r\n  ÆTATIS SUÆ 91.\r\n\r\nBefore speaking of Hobbes and his connection with Hardwick, where\r\nhe died, it will be well to note that the parish registers of Hault\r\nHucknall commence in the year 1662, and that the entry regarding the\r\nburial of Hobbes, for the copy of which we have to express our thanks\r\nto the Rev. Henry Cottingham, the respected vicar of the parish, is as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n  “Anno Regni   } 31      Law. Waine, { James Hardwick,\r\n  Caroli Sucund }           _Vicar_.  { Thomas Whitehead,\r\n  Anno dom. 1679.                        _Churchwardens_.\r\n\r\n  “Hardwick    | Thomas Hobbs Magnus Philosophus,\r\n                   Sepul. fuit et affidavit in Lana\r\n                   Sepoliendo exhibit. Decem. 6” (or 8).\r\n\r\nThomas Hobbes[28] was born at Malmesbury on Good Friday, 1588, in\r\nthe year of “the Spanish Armada,” and it is said that his birth was\r\nhastened by his mother’s terror of the enemy’s fleet, and that a\r\ntimidity with which through life he was afflicted was thus induced. He\r\nand fear, he was wont to say, “were born together.” His being born on\r\nGood Friday has also been turned to account in the way of accounting\r\nfor his wonderful precocity as a child, and his subsequent intellectual\r\nprogress. At the age of fifteen he was sent to Oxford, and there made\r\nsuch progress that before he was twenty years old he was taken into\r\nthe service of Sir William Cavendish, who had a few years before been\r\ncreated Baron Cavendish of Hardwick, as tutor to his sons, Gilbert,\r\nwho died before attaining his majority, and William, who became second\r\nEarl of Devonshire. With the latter young nobleman, who married, as\r\nalready narrated, Christian, daughter of Lord Bruce, of Kinloss, Hobbes\r\ntravelled through France and Italy. At his death he left, besides\r\nother issue, William, Lord Cavendish, who succeeded him as Earl of\r\nDevonshire, and who, at that time, was only in the tenth year of his\r\nage. This Lord Hardwick was, as his father had been before him, placed\r\nunder the tuition of Hobbes, “who instructed him in the family for\r\nthree years, and then, about 1634, travelled with him as his governor\r\ninto France and Italy, with the longest stay in Paris for all the\r\npoliter parts of breeding. He returned in 1637, and, when he soon after\r\ncame of age, his mother (Christian, Countess of Devonshire), delivered\r\nup to him his great houses in Derbyshire all ready furnished.”\r\n\r\nWith this nobleman (who married Elizabeth, daughter of the Earl of\r\nSalisbury, and was succeeded by his son, afterwards created Duke of\r\nDevonshire) Thomas Hobbes remained for the rest of his life. “The earl\r\nfor his whole life entertained Mr. Hobbes in his family as his old\r\ntutor rather than as his friend or confidant; he let him live under his\r\nroof in ease and plenty and his own way, without making use of him in\r\nany publick or so much as domestick affairs. He would often express an\r\nabhorrence of some of his principles in policy and religion; and both\r\nhe and his lady would frequently put off the mention of his name and\r\nsay ‘He was an humourist, and that nobody could account for him.’”\r\n\r\nOf Hobbes’s works—of his “De Cive,” his “Leviathan,” his “Elémens\r\nPhilosophiques de Citoyen,” his “Behemoth,” or his hundred other\r\nwritings—it is, of course, not here our province to speak; but one\r\nof his smaller productions, because of its connection with the family\r\nof his noble patron, his “De Mirabilibus Pecci,” may claim a passing\r\nword. This is a Latin poem descriptive of the “Wonders of the Peak, in\r\nDerbyshire”—the same subject which Charles Cotton, later on, wrote\r\nupon in his “Wonders of the Peak”—wherein Hobbes describes a tour\r\nwhich he, with a friend, took on horseback, starting from Chatsworth,\r\nwhere he was residing, and visiting Pilsley, Hassop, Hope, Castleton,\r\nPeak Forest, Eldon Hole, the Ebbing and Flowing Well, Buxton, Poole’s\r\nHole, Chelmorton, Sheldon, Ashford, and so back to Chatsworth, quaintly\r\ndescribing all he saw on his journey.\r\n\r\nIf the earl was attached to Hobbes, he was at least amply repaid by the\r\ndevotion and fondness his old tutor showed to him and to his family.\r\nIndeed, so intimate was the old man with the family of his patron,\r\nthat whenever the earl removed from one of his houses to another,\r\nHobbes accompanied them, even to the last of his long life. “There is a\r\ntradition in the family,” said Bishop Kennett, in 1707, “of the manners\r\nand customs of Mr. Hobbes somewhat observable. His professed rule of\r\nhealth was to dedicate the morning to his health and the afternoon\r\nto his studies. And therefore at his first rising he walk’d out and\r\nclimb’d any hill within his reach; or, if the weather was not dry, he\r\nfatigued himself within doors by some exercise or other to be in a\r\nsweat; recommending that practice upon this opinion, that an old man\r\nhad more moisture than heat, and therefore by such motion heat was to\r\nbe acquired and moisture expelled. After this he took a comfortable\r\nbreakfast, and then went round the lodgings to wait upon the earl, the\r\ncountess, and the children, and any considerable strangers, paying some\r\nshort address to all of them.” ... “Towards the end of his life he had\r\nvery few books, and those he read but very little, thinking he was now\r\nonly to digest what formerly he had fed upon. If company came to visit\r\nhim, he would be free in discourse till he was pressed or contradicted,\r\nand then he had the infirmities of being short and peevish, and\r\nreferring to his writings for better satisfaction. His friends, who had\r\nthe liberty of introducing strangers to him, made these terms with them\r\nbefore their admission—that they should not dispute with the old man,\r\nnor contradict him.”\r\n\r\nThus lived Hobbes, whether at Hardwick or at Chatsworth, and thus\r\nwere all his foibles kindly looked upon and administered to, and his\r\nlife made happy by allowing him in everything—even his attendance on\r\nworship in the private chapel, and his leaving before the sermon—to\r\nhave, literally, “his own way.” In December, 1679, the earl and\r\ncountess went from Chatsworth to Hardwick Hall, probably with the\r\nintention of keeping up their Christmas festivities there, and even\r\nat that time the old man—for he was ninety-one years of age—would\r\naccompany them. “He could not endure to be left in an empty house,\r\nand whenever the earl removed he would go along with him, even to his\r\nlast stage from Chatsworth to Hardwick; when in a very weak condition\r\nhe dared not be left behind, but made his way upon a feather bed in a\r\ncoach, though he survived the journey but a few days. He could not bear\r\nany discourse of death, and seemed to cast off all thoughts of it. He\r\ndelighted to reckon upon long life. The winter before he died he had\r\nmade a warmer coat, which he said must last him three years, and then\r\nhe would have such another. In his last sickness his frequent questions\r\nwere whether his disease was curable; and when intimations were given\r\nthat he might have ease, but no remedy, he used this expression:—‘I\r\nshall be glad then to find a hole to creep out of the world at;’ which\r\nare reported to have been his last sensible words, and his lying some\r\ndays following in a silent stupefaction did seem owing to his mind\r\nmore than to his body. The only thought of death that he appeared to\r\nentertain in time of health was to take care of some inscription on his\r\ngrave. He would suffer some friends to dictate an epitaph, among which\r\nhe was best pleased with this honour, ‘_This is the true philosopher’s\r\nstone_;’ which, indeed,” adds the bishop, “would have had as much\r\nreligion in it as that which now remains,” and of which we have just\r\ngiven a copy.\r\n\r\nAs we have already remarked, it is not our business to discuss the\r\npolitical or philosophical principles which Hobbes expressed in his\r\nwritings: these, both in and after his time, were the subject of much\r\ncontroversy. We may, however, remark that it was well for those who\r\nwere committed to his tutelage and close companionship, that their\r\nminds do not seem to have been corrupted by his avowed rejection, not\r\nonly of the Christian faith, but apparently of any faith at all in the\r\nexistence of a Deity. Nowhere—and he had abundance of opportunity in\r\nsome, at least, of his voluminous writings—does he show any glimmering\r\neven of religious belief; and the history of his latest years, and the\r\nlast expression which proceeded from his mouth, testify to his fear of\r\ndeath, and his dislike to have the subject mentioned in his hearing.\r\nA mere materialist would not thus have been “subject to bondage,”\r\ninasmuch as the conviction of utter annihilation must remove all ground\r\nof apprehension regarding the “something after death.” Hobbes closed\r\nhis eyes a resolute doubter, if not an actual disbeliever; and no ray\r\nof comfort or of hope came to brighten his last moments as he passed\r\ninto the world of spirits to exchange uncertainty for certainty, the\r\nmortal for the immortal.\r\n\r\nThe late Sir William Molesworth endeavoured to rekindle some interest\r\nin Hobbes’s writings by republishing an edition of his works: happily,\r\nthe attempt was a failure, so far, we believe, as to any extensive sale\r\nof the poison contained in them.\r\n\r\nExternally, Hault Hucknall Church, although highly picturesque and\r\nvenerable in appearance, presents not many striking features. The\r\ntower, which stands between nave and chancel, was probably terminated\r\nby a spire—the upper remaining part being of much later date than the\r\nlower.\r\n\r\nWe have thus described the seat, next in importance to that of\r\nChatsworth, of the long-descended and long-ennobled family of\r\nCavendish. Their principal residence, Chatsworth, we describe and\r\nillustrate in another part of this volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARUNDEL CASTLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nARUNDEL castle takes high rank among the “Stately Homes of England.”\r\nSome of its more prominent features we present to our readers. Of very\r\nremote antiquity—for it traces back to a period long anterior to the\r\nConquest; deeply interesting in its historical associations—for it has\r\nplayed a leading part in the principal events of the kingdom; and of\r\ngreat importance in its family connections—for a long line of noble\r\nand illustrious names, from the reign of Alfred the Great to our own\r\ntime, are associated with its history—Arundel stands, a proud monument\r\nof England’s greatness, and of the beauty of England’s fair domains.\r\n\r\nThe manor of Arundel was, it is stated, given in the will of Alfred\r\nthe Great (“Æthelme mines brother suna thone ham æt Ealdingburnam, &\r\næt Cumtune, & æt Crundellan, & æt Beadingum, & æt Beadingahamme, & æt\r\nBurnham, & æt Thunresfelda, & æt Æscengum”) to his nephew, Æthelm,\r\nthe son of his brother. To Earl Godwine, and to King Harold, it is\r\nalso stated successively to have passed. At the time of the Norman\r\nConquest the possessions and the earldoms of Arundel, Chichester,\r\nand Shrewsbury, were given to Roger de Montgomery, a relative of\r\nthe Conqueror, and “one of the council which formed the invasion of\r\nEngland, leading the centre of the army in that famous battle of\r\nBattle Abbey, wherein the crown accrued to the Norman.” He commanded\r\nthe entire army of archers and light infantry in the decisive battle;\r\nand to his superior skill in military tactics was principally owing\r\nthe successful issue. To requite him for his valuable services, and\r\nplace him in a position of advantage, the Conqueror established him at\r\nArundel in all the magnificence of the age. Of his immense possessions,\r\nthose by which he was immediately surrounded constituted three\r\nlordships, ten hundreds and their courts and suits of service, eighteen\r\nparks, and seventy-seven manors. He took a prominent part in affairs of\r\nstate, both in the reign of the Conqueror and in that of William Rufus,\r\nand at last entered the monastery at Shrewsbury, which he had founded,\r\nand where he died. He was succeeded in his possessions in Normandy by\r\nhis eldest son, Robert, Comte de Belesme, and in his English earldoms\r\nand possessions by his youngest son, Hugh, who led a turbulent life,\r\nand met with a premature death at Anglesey, in repulsing the descent\r\nmade by Magnus, King of Norway, on that island; he was shot from his\r\nhorse by an arrow, which pierced through his brain.\r\n\r\nOn the death of Hugh, his elder brother, Robert, came over from\r\nNormandy to claim the earldoms and inheritance, to which, on paying\r\na heavy fine, he succeeded. “He was a cruel, crafty, and subtle man,\r\nbut powerful in arms, and eloquent in speech, and for fifteen years\r\nseldom out of rebellion; till at length peace being made between the\r\nking and his competitor, he was called to account for all his actions,\r\nbut shifted away and fortified his castles, which the king (Henry I.)\r\nbesieged, and forced him to sue for clemency, which was granted; but\r\nall his possessions were seized, and himself banished.” He ultimately\r\ndied in Warwick Castle—the earldoms reverting to the crown.\r\n\r\nBefore tracing the descent to a later time, a word on the derivation of\r\nthe name Arundel may not be out of place. It has been conjectured to\r\nbe derived from various sources. Thus, Hirundelle, from _Hirundo_, a\r\nswallow; from the name of a famous horse, _Hirondelle_, which was the\r\nfavourite of its owner, one Sir Bevis, who is said to have been warder\r\nor constable of the castle; from _Arundo_, a reed, which grows in the\r\nriver; from _Portus Adurni_; and from _Arun_, the name of the river,\r\nand _dell_, from the valley along which it flows; as well as from\r\n_araf_ and _del_, and other sources.[29]\r\n\r\nThe estates and earldom having reverted to the crown under Henry I.,\r\nwere settled upon that monarch’s second wife, Adeliza, daughter of\r\nthe Duke of Lorraine, who married, for her second husband, William\r\nde Albini (son of William de Albini, surnamed Pincerna, who came over\r\nwith the Conqueror), who is said to have been called “William of the\r\nStronghand,” because, when cast into a lion’s den—so the story goes,\r\nin consequence of his refusal to marry the Queen of France—he seized\r\nthe lion, thrust his hand into its mouth, and down his throat, and\r\ntore out its heart! He was Lord of Buckenham, and one of the most\r\npowerful of the barons. In the troublous reign of Stephen, Albini and\r\nhis royal wife lived at Arundel Castle, and here received the Empress\r\nMatilda, daughter of Henry I. by his first wife, and mother of Henry\r\nII., who, with her half-brother, Robert of Gloucester, and a retinue of\r\nknights and retainers, remained there for some time. Stephen, on news\r\nreaching him of the presence of his rival, the Empress, drew his forces\r\nto Arundel, and laid close siege to the castle. Albini, however, not\r\nonly preserved his royal guest from violence, but by good generalship\r\nor caution, secured for her a safe conduct to Bristol, from which she\r\ntook ship, and returned to the Continent. Albini was, subsequently,\r\nthe meditator between Stephen and the son of Queen Matilda, Henry,\r\nafterwards Henry II., by which the crown was secured to that prince\r\nand his heirs, and so brought about a happy peace. For his loyalty and\r\ngood services he was, by Henry II., confirmed in the estates and titles\r\nhe had enjoyed through his wife Queen Adeliza, and was, in addition to\r\nthe earldoms of Arundel and Chichester, created Earl of Sussex. Besides\r\ntaking a very prominent part in most affairs of the nation, Albini\r\nwas one of the deputation to the Pope in the matter of the king’s\r\ndispute with A’Beckett; was sent to conduct the daughter of Matilda\r\ninto Germany on her marriage with the Duke of Saxony; was one of the\r\nking’s trustees to the treaty of the marriage of Prince John to the\r\ndaughter of the Count of Savoy; and commanded the royal forces against\r\nthe rebellious princes, taking prisoners the Earl of Leicester, and his\r\ncountess, and all the retinue of knights. He and his wife founded the\r\nPriory of Calceto, near Arundel; built the Abbey of Buckenham; endowed\r\nprebends in Winchester; founded the Priory of Pynham, near Arundel; and\r\nthe Chapel of St. Thomas at Wymondham. This earl having, in conjunction\r\nwith his wife, founded the Priory of Calceto, near Arundel, granted\r\nits priors many privileges: among which were an annual allowance of\r\ntimber for the repairs of the bridge, and a right of pasturage for\r\ncattle in common with the burgesses of Arundel. At the dissolution of\r\nthe monasteries, the office of bridge-warden, previously held by the\r\nfriars, devolved on the Mayor of Arundel, who still continues the\r\noffice. The meadows were retained in the possession of the burgesses,\r\nand are still held by them. He died in 1176, and was succeeded by his\r\neldest son (or grandson), William de Albini, who married Maud, widow of\r\nthe Earl of Clare, by whom he had issue, two sons, William and Hugh,\r\nand six daughters. He was succeeded by his eldest son, William, who,\r\ndying without issue, was succeeded by his brother, Hugh de Albini, the\r\nyoungest son, who married Isabel, daughter to the Earl of Warren and\r\nSurrey, but died without issue. The estates then passed to his sisters\r\nand co-heiresses; that of Arundel descending to John Fitzalan, son of\r\nthe second sister of Hugh de Albini, by her husband, John Fitzalan,\r\nBaron of Clun and Oswestry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Quadrangle, Arundel Castle._]\r\n\r\nHe was succeeded in the earldom and estates by his son, John, who dying\r\ntwo years afterwards, was succeeded by his son, Richard, then only five\r\nyears of age. That nobleman greatly improved the Castle of Arundel, and\r\nis thus described in “the Siege of Caerlaverock:”—\r\n\r\n  “Richard, the Earl of Arundel,\r\n    A well-beloved and handsome knight,\r\n  In crimson surcoat marked, and well\r\n    With gold and rampant lion dight.”\r\n\r\nIn 1302 King Edward I. was the guest of the earl, at Arundel, and at\r\nthat time created Arundel a borough, and granted the earl certain\r\nprivileges, of taxes, &c., for the purpose of fortifying it. He was\r\nsucceeded by his son, Edmund Fitzalan, who, being taken prisoner by\r\nMortimer, was beheaded at Hereford. He was succeeded by his son,\r\nRichard Fitzalan, to whom Arundel Castle, which had, on the execution\r\nof the last earl, been giving to the Earl of Kent, was restored, as\r\nwere also the baronies of Fitzalan, Clun, and Oswestry. He led an\r\nactive and useful life, and distinguished himself at Crescy, Vannes,\r\nThouars, and other places, and founded a chantry of six priests at\r\nArundel. He was succeeded by his son, Richard, in his titles and\r\nestates; he died on the scaffold, in Cheapside, in 1397, the king,\r\nRichard II., being present at the execution. Ten days afterwards, “it\r\nbeing bruited abroad for a miracle that his head should be grown to his\r\nbodye againe,” the king sent, secretly, by night, “certaine nobilitye\r\nto see his bodie taken up, that he might be certified of the truth,\r\nwhich done, and perceiving that it was a fable,” he had the grave\r\nclosed up again. Through this attainder Arundel reverted to the crown,\r\nand was given to the Duke of Exeter.\r\n\r\nThe earl was succeeded by his son, Thomas Fitzalan, who was, by Henry\r\nIV., restored both in blood and in all his possessions and titles. He\r\nheld, among other important offices, those of Warden of the Cinque\r\nPorts, Constable of Dover Castle, and Lord High Treasurer of England.\r\nHe married, in the presence of the king and queen, Beatrix, daughter of\r\nJohn, King of Portugal, but died without issue, when the Arundel estate\r\npassed, by entail, to his cousin, Sir John Fitzalan (or Arundel, as he\r\ncalled himself), Lord Maltravers. His son, John, succeeded him as Baron\r\nMaltravers and Earl of Arundel, and was created Duke of Touraine, but\r\nbeing wounded before Beavois, was carried prisoner to that place, where\r\nhe died, and was succeeded by his son, Humphrey, who died a minor. The\r\ntitle and estates then passed to the brother of Earl John, William\r\nFitzalan, who, in his turn, was succeeded by his son, Thomas, who again\r\nwas succeeded by his son, William, who died in 1543. This nobleman was\r\nsucceeded in his titles and estates by his son, Henry Fitzalan, who in\r\nthe four reigns of Henry VIII., Edward VI., Mary, and Elizabeth, led\r\na most eventful life, holding many important offices, and acquitted\r\nhimself nobly in all. He left issue, two daughters (his only son having\r\ndied a minor in his father’s lifetime), Joan, married to Lord Lumley,\r\nand Mary, married to Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk. But the latter\r\nlady having died after giving birth to a son, Philip Howard, and the\r\nother, Lady Lumley, having been married twenty years without issue,\r\nthe earl entailed the estates, &c., on Lord and Lady Lumley for their\r\nlives, and then to Philip Howard, the son of his sister Mary. Thus\r\nended the Fitzalan family, and from that time the titles and estates\r\nhave belonged to the ducal family of Howard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Entrance Gate—from the Interior._]\r\n\r\nPhilip Howard, so christened after Philip I., of Spain, one of his\r\ngodfathers, was only son by his first wife, Mary, daughter of the Earl\r\nof Arundel, of Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk, who was beheaded for\r\nhigh treason in 1572. The title of Duke of Norfolk being lost by his\r\nattainder, Philip Howard did not enjoy it, but was Earl of Arundel and\r\nSurrey. He was also unjustly attainted, was tried for high treason,\r\nsentenced for execution, but ultimately died, during his imprisonment,\r\nin the Tower. This ill-fated young nobleman had married Anne, daughter\r\nand heiress of Lord Dacres of Gillesland, by whom he had an only\r\nchild, born after he was cast into prison, and who succeeded him.\r\nThis was Thomas Howard, the celebrated Earl of Arundel and Surrey\r\n(and afterwards Earl of Norfolk), whose brilliant career and high\r\nattainments are matters of history. His lordship, who is so well known\r\nas the founder of the collection of marbles, &c., married the Lady\r\nAlathea Talbot, daughter and one of the co-heiresses of Gilbert Talbot,\r\nEarl of Shrewsbury, by whom he had issue, Henry Frederick, Lord Mowbray\r\nand Maltravers (who succeeded him), Sir William Howard, ancestor of the\r\nEarls of Stafford, and James, Thomas, Gilbert, and Charles, who all\r\ndied unmarried.\r\n\r\nHenry Frederick, the eldest son, who, during his father’s lifetime,\r\nhad been called to the Upper House by the title of Baron Mowbray and\r\nMaltravers, married the Lady Elizabeth Stuart, eldest daughter of the\r\nDuke of Lennox, of the blood royal, for which, for a time, he incurred\r\nthe displeasure of his Majesty, and, with his lady, was placed in\r\nconfinement. He had issue, ten sons and three daughters. These sons\r\nwere, Thomas, who succeeded him; Henry; Philip, who became a cardinal,\r\nand was variously styled Cardinal of Norfolk and Cardinal of England;\r\nCharles, who married Mary Tattershall and founded the Greystocke line;\r\nTalbot, Edward, and Francis, who died unmarried; Bernard, who married\r\nCatherine Tattershall; and two others.\r\n\r\nThomas Howard, who succeeded his father as Earl of Arundel, Surrey, and\r\nNorfolk, &c., had restored to him, and to the heirs male of himself\r\nand his father, the dukedom of Norfolk and all the honours belonging\r\nto that title. He thus became fifth Duke of Norfolk, a title which\r\nhas continued without further interruption till the present time.\r\nHe died unmarried in 1677, when the title and estates passed to his\r\nbrother Henry, sixth Duke of Norfolk, who had been previously created\r\na peer by the title of Baron Howard of Castle Rising, Earl of Norwich,\r\nand Earl Marshal of England. He married, first, Lady Anne Somerset,\r\ndaughter of the Marquis of Worcester, and by her had issue, two sons\r\nand three daughters; and secondly, Grace Bickerton, by whom he had\r\nthree sons and three daughters. Dying in 1684, he was succeeded by his\r\neldest son, Henry Howard (who had been summoned to Parliament in his\r\nfather’s lifetime as Baron Mowbray), as seventh Duke of Norfolk, who\r\nwas one of the supporters of the Prince of Orange. He married the Lady\r\nMary Mordaunt, daughter of the Earl of Peterborough, from whom he was\r\ndivorced in 1700, but died without issue in 1701, when the title and\r\nestates passed to his nephew—\r\n\r\nThomas, eighth Duke of Norfolk, who married Mary, daughter of Sir\r\nNicholas Sherburn, by whom he had no issue; and dying in 1732, was\r\nsucceeded, as ninth Duke of Norfolk, by his brother Edward, who\r\nmarried, in 1727, Mary Blount, but died without issue in 1777,\r\nat the age of ninety-one. The titles and estates then passed to a\r\ndistant member of the family, his third cousin, Charles Howard, of the\r\nGreystocke family, who thus became tenth Duke of Norfolk. He married\r\nCatherine, daughter of John Brocholes, Esq., and by her had issue,\r\nbesides a daughter who died young, one son, Charles, who succeeded him,\r\nas eleventh Duke of Norfolk, in 1786.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Keep._]\r\n\r\nThis nobleman, who was the restorer, or rebuilder, of Arundel Castle—a\r\nman of considerable literary and scientific attainments—married,\r\nfirst, Mary Anne Copinger, and second, Frances Scudamore, but had no\r\nissue by either. He was succeeded by his relative, Bernard Edward\r\nHoward, as twelfth Duke of Norfolk, who, marrying the Lady Elizabeth\r\nBelasyse, daughter of Earl Faulconberg (from whom he was divorced), had\r\nan only son, Henry Charles, who succeeded him in 1842.\r\n\r\nHenry Charles, thirteenth duke, who was born in 1791, married, in 1814,\r\nthe Lady Charlotte Leveson Gower, daughter of the Duke of Sutherland\r\n(she is still living), by whom he had issue, Henry Granville, Earl\r\nof Surrey, who succeeded him; Lord Edward George Fitzalan Howard, of\r\nGlossop Hall, Derbyshire, created, 1869, “Baron Howard, of Glossop;”\r\nLord Bernard Thomas; and the Ladies Mary Charlotte and Adeliza Matilda.\r\nHis Grace died in 1856, and was succeeded as fourteenth duke by his\r\neldest son, Henry Granville Fitzalan-Howard (who had assumed, by\r\nroyal sign-manual, in 1842, the surname of Fitzalan before that of\r\nHoward). He married, in 1839, Augusta Mary Minna Catherine, daughter\r\nof the first Baron Lyons (she still survives), by whom he had issue,\r\ntwo sons, viz., Henry Fitzalan-Howard, the present Duke of Norfolk,\r\nand Lord Edward Bernard Fitzalan-Howard; and seven daughters, viz.,\r\nthe Lady Victoria Alexandrina, born 1840, and married in 1861 to\r\nJames Robert Hope-Scott, Esq., Q.C.; the Lady Minna Charlotte, born\r\n1843; the Lady Mary Adeliza, born 1845; the Lady Ethelreda, born\r\n1849; the Lady Philippa, born 1852; the Lady Anne, born 1857; and the\r\nLady Margaret, born 1860. During the life of this nobleman, who was\r\nuniversally beloved and respected, her Majesty Queen Victoria and the\r\nPrince Consort paid a visit of three days to Arundel Castle, where the\r\nreception was kept up with regal magnificence. His Grace died in 1860,\r\nand was succeeded by his eldest son, then in his thirteenth year.\r\n\r\nThe present peer, his Grace Henry Fitzalan-Howard, fifteenth Duke\r\nof Norfolk, Earl of Arundel, Earl of Surrey, Earl of Norfolk, Baron\r\nMaltravers, Baron Fitzalan, Baron Clun, Baron Oswestry, Premier Duke\r\nand Earl next to the blood royal, Hereditary Earl Marshal, and Chief\r\nButler of England, was born on the 27th of December, 1847, and attained\r\nhis majority in 1868. His grace is unmarried. He is the patron of seven\r\nlivings; but, “being a Roman Catholic, cannot present.”\r\n\r\nThe arms of the Duke of Norfolk are—Quarterly: first, _gules_, on a\r\nbend between six cross-crosslets, fitchée, _argent_, an escutcheon,\r\n_or_, charged with a demi-lion rampant, pierced through the mouth with\r\nan arrow, within a double tressure, flory counter-flory, all _gules_,\r\nfor Howard; second, the arms of England (_gules_, three lions passant\r\nguardant, _or_), charged with a label of three points, _argent_, for\r\ndifference, for Plantagenet; third, chequy, _or_ and _azure_, for\r\nWarren; fourth, _gules_, a lion rampant, _argent_, for Mowbray. Crest,\r\non a chapeau _gules_, turned up, _ermine_, a lion statant-guardant,\r\n_or_ ducally gorged, _argent_. Behind the arms two marshal’s staves\r\nin saltire, _or_, enamelled at each end, _sable_. Supporters:—on the\r\ndexter side a lion, _argent_, and on the sinister, a horse of the\r\nsame, holding in his mouth a slip of oak, fructed, _proper_. The motto\r\nis “Sola Virtus Invicta.”\r\n\r\nThus having briefly traced the history of the house of Howard, so far\r\nas the main line connected with Arundel Castle is concerned, we turn\r\nour attention to some of the many beauties and attractions of the\r\ndomain of Arundel.\r\n\r\nIn situation, as a fortress, few sites were so well chosen as that of\r\nArundel Castle. At the southern extremity of the elevated platform on\r\nwhich it stands a strong wall enclosed the inner court, containing\r\nupwards of five acres; on the north-east and south-east a precipitous\r\ndip of the hill to ninety feet, rendered the castle inaccessible.\r\nOn the remaining sides a deep _fosse_, protected on the north by a\r\ndouble vallation, and cutting off all external communication in that\r\ndirection, secured the garrison from any sudden incursion or surprise.\r\nIn the centre rose the Donjon, or Keep, circular in form, enormous\r\nin strength, crowning a lofty artificial mound, and commanding a\r\nwide and uninterrupted view of all the neighbouring approaches. “The\r\nwalls, from eight to ten feet in thickness, enclosed a nearly circular\r\nspace of more than sixty feet in diameter, and of great height—the\r\napartments being all lit from the central well-staircase, and there\r\nbeing no loopholes in the walls. This Keep—which still stands in all\r\nits venerable and hoary age—is supposed to have been built by Alfred\r\nthe Great, and to have been recased in Norman times, when the present\r\ndoorway was made. To the same period belongs a portion of the tower\r\nnear it, and which is connected with the Keep by a covered passage\r\ncarried across the moat. The Barbican, or Bevis’s Tower, occupying the\r\nnorth-west side of the ditch surrounding the Keep, has also some good\r\nNorman features, and it, as well as the Keep covered with luxuriant\r\nivy, and the old entrance, built by Fitzalan, form the most interesting\r\nand picturesque portions of the venerable place.”\r\n\r\nThe entrance to the castle at the present time is at the top of High\r\nStreet. The approach is enclosed by embattled walls with turrets,\r\nand the entrance gateway, surmounted by a portcullis and the arms of\r\nHoward, is between two massive embattled towers: of this gateway we\r\ngive an engraving, taken from the interior. Following the carriage-way,\r\nthe visitor arrives at the entrance to the grand quadrangle, a massive\r\nand lofty arched gateway flanked by two towers. Passing through this\r\ngateway the appearance of the castle is grand and imposing. On the\r\nright of the gateway is the CHAPEL, and adjoining it is the BARON’S\r\nHALL, or Banqueting Chamber; on the south side is the grand, or state\r\nentrance; and in the north-east wing is the Library, &c. None of these\r\nbuildings, however, are of ancient times.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Library._]\r\n\r\nOne of the first objects that will be noticed by the visitor is a\r\nbas-relief, which occupies a large space in the front wall of the\r\nALFRED SALOON, next to the Great Library. It represents Alfred the\r\nGreat instituting, or founding, trial by jury—the king himself\r\nstanding in the centre surrounded by his nobles and people, and\r\ndelivering a scroll, which he holds in his hand, bearing the words, in\r\nSaxon characters, “That man fiœbe gemot on cum Wapentace” (That man, in\r\nevery hundred (Wapentake), shall find twelve jury). It was designed by\r\nRossi, a sculptor of modern time.\r\n\r\nThe castle is entered from this quadrangle or court-yard, by the grand\r\nentrance, or state entrance, as it is called. This is a fine modern\r\ndoorway, of Norman design, in a machicolated central tower of three\r\nstories in height. Over the doorway is a large central window, on\r\neach side of which is a colossal figure of Hospitality and Liberty\r\nrespectively. Over this again are the arms of the Howards, sculptured,\r\nand these again are surmounted by the machicolations, parapet, &c.\r\nImmediately on entering this splendid ducal residence, the visitor\r\nreaches the GRAND-STAIRCASE leading to its various apartments.\r\n\r\nThe BARON’S HALL, or BANQUETING CHAMBER, is a remarkably fine, and even\r\ngorgeous, apartment. “Its architecture, like that of the chapel, is in\r\nthe style of the fourteenth century. It is 71 feet in length, by 35\r\nin breadth, lofty in proportion, and, as a whole, produces a striking\r\neffect on the spectator.” The roof is of Spanish chestnut, elaborately\r\ncarved, and the sculptures around the walls and on the windows are of\r\nelegant design. The stained-glass windows are, however, “the grand\r\nattraction, for in these the story of English freedom is brilliantly\r\ntold. They are thirteen in number. The great window illustrates the\r\nratification of the great charter by King John, who seems to pause\r\nin the act of affixing his signature to the instrument.” Behind him\r\nare several prelates, while to his right are the Pope’s Legate and\r\nthe Archbishop of Dublin, and, to his left, Cardinal Langton. There\r\nare also Baron Fitzwalter, the Master of the Knights Templars, the\r\nLord Mayor, and others. In the other windows, which were superbly\r\nexecuted by Eginton, one of the best of our artists in stained glass,\r\nare full-length figures of eight barons of the Norfolk family, who\r\naided in procuring the charter—the heads, however, as well as those\r\nin the large window, being portraits of members of the Howard family\r\nof the beginning of the present century, at which time the windows\r\nwere executed. On the walls are several fine suits of armour, &c. This\r\nmagnificent hall was first opened on the 15th of June, 1815, being the\r\n600th anniversary of the signing of the charter.\r\n\r\nThe GREAT DRAWING-ROOM is a noble apartment, commanding a magnificent\r\nand extensive view of the valley of the Arun, and the surrounding\r\ncountry. In it is a large collection of family portraits, among which\r\nare Thomas Howard, Earl of Surrey, vindicating himself (“Sire, he was\r\nmy crowned king. If the authority of Parliament had placed the crown\r\non that stake, I would have fought for it. Let it place it on your\r\nhead and you will find me as ready in your defence”) before Henry VII.\r\nfor the part he took at the battle of Bosworth field; John, Duke of\r\nNorfolk, who fell at Bosworth, and who is generally known as “Jocky of\r\nNorfolk,” from the rude couplet:—\r\n\r\n  “Jocky of Norfolk, be not too bold,\r\n  For Dickon thy master is bought and sold”—\r\n\r\nwhich was found written on his gate, as a warning, on the morning\r\nwhen he set out on his fatal expedition; Henry, Earl of Surrey, the\r\ngreat poet of his age, “who was not only the ornament of the court\r\nof Henry VIII., which he attended in the capacity of companion to the\r\nDuke of Richmond, but of the still more brilliant and chivalrous court\r\nof Francis I. His travels on the Continent were those of a scholar\r\nand knight-errant; and the vision which he had in Agrippa’s magic\r\nmirror of his lady-love, the ‘Fair Geraldine,’ whom he has so nobly\r\nperpetuated in verse, excited in him such a transport of enthusiasm,\r\nthat, at a tournament in Florence, he challenged all who could handle\r\na lance—Turk, Saracen, or cannibal—to dispute against him her claims\r\nto the supremacy of beauty, and came off victorious: but the well-known\r\nhatred of the tyrant Henry to all the Howards prematurely extinguished\r\nthis bright promise of excellence, and Surrey, the last victim of\r\nthe royal murderer, perished on the scaffold at the early age of\r\ntwenty-seven:”—\r\n\r\n  “Who has not heard of Surrey’s fame?\r\n  His was the hero’s soul of fire,\r\n  And his the bard’s immortal name.”\r\n\r\nIn 1547, he was beheaded on Tower Hill. One of the dark blots on\r\nBritish history, was the execution of this true hero of the pen and\r\nsword. The portraits also include those of Thomas, Duke of Norfolk\r\n(by Holbein), who was beheaded, and his wife, Mary Fitzalan; Henry\r\nFitzalan; Cardinal Howard; “Belted Will Howard,” of whom we shall speak\r\nin our account of Castle Howard; and various other members of this\r\ndistinguished family.\r\n\r\nThe DINING-ROOM, formed out of the ancient family chapel, is\r\nprincipally remarkable for its large stained-glass window, the subject\r\nof which is the meeting of King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba—the\r\nheads being portraits of the twelfth duke and his duchess. On each side\r\nis respectively the mercy-seat in the tabernacle, and the interior of\r\nthe tabernacle.\r\n\r\nThe LIBRARY, the building of which was commenced in 1801, is an\r\napartment of much magnificence. The book-cases and reading-galleries\r\nare supported by fifteen columns, wrought out of the richest Spanish\r\nmahogany; while the spidered roof displays a beauty of workmanship and\r\ndelicacy of carving, enriched with fruit-foliage, which have seldom\r\nbeen surpassed. It is divided into several compartments for reading\r\nrecesses, and communicates with the ALFRED SALOON by folded doors.\r\n\r\nThe CHAPEL adjoins the Baron’s Hall, and is a chaste and beautiful\r\napartment.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary further to describe the interior of the castle; but\r\nit will be well to note that a chamber over the inner gateway enjoys\r\nthe traditionary fame of having been the sleeping-place of the Empress\r\nMatilda. It is a low square apartment, and contains a bedstead which\r\nthe queen is said to have occupied; but, unfortunately for the charm\r\nof the tradition, it is some centuries later in date than the time in\r\nwhich she lived.\r\n\r\nUnder the east end of the castle is a large vault, upwards of 60 feet\r\nin length, the massive walls of which are formed of blocks of chalk,\r\nstrengthened with ribs of stone, and are of about 7 feet in thickness.\r\nThis vault was used, of course, as a place of safety for prisoners,\r\nand a curious instance of escape from it is recorded. It seems that in\r\nthe year 1404 one John Mot was here confined on a charge of robbery,\r\nbut contrived to make his escape. Before he could get clear away, his\r\nflight was discovered, and he was followed. Finding himself closely\r\npursued, he suddenly turned to the College of the Holy Trinity, and\r\nseizing the ring attached to the gate just as his captors were about\r\nto lay hands on him, claimed the right of sanctuary. He was, however,\r\nforcibly seized, and carried back to prison. Knowledge of the affair\r\nreaching the ears of the priests, two of the parties who assisted the\r\nconstable in making the seizure of Mot were summoned before the bishop,\r\nfound guilty, and “ordered to make a pilgrimage on foot to the shrine\r\nof St. Richard at Chichester, to present an offering there according\r\nto their ability, to be cudgelled (_fustigati_) five times through the\r\nchurch of Arundel, and five times to recite the paternoster, ave, and\r\ncreed, upon their knees before the crucifix of the high altar.” Before\r\nthe sentence, however, could be carried into execution, the prisoner\r\nwas wisely restored to the church, the cudgelling was remitted, and\r\nofferings of burning tapers were substituted.\r\n\r\nA word may be said about the fine old horned owls that at one time\r\ngave renown to the Keep—owls of a peculiar breed, and about whom many\r\ncurious anecdotes have been related. At present, however, they greet\r\nthe visitors under glass, in cases; but it is understood that some\r\nof their progeny are preparing to take the places in life of the old\r\ndenizens of the time-honoured ruin.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that all the inhabited portions of Arundel Castle are\r\nof comparatively recent date; they are fitted up with much judgment and\r\ntaste, but by no means gorgeously. In one of the lesser chambers are\r\nhung some modern drawings of great merit and value, by Prout, Hunt,\r\nCopley Fielding, David Cox, and other artists of the best days of the\r\nBritish school.[30]\r\n\r\nThe KEEP is the great attraction of the castle and domain of Arundel.\r\nThough now but a picturesque ruin, it has been prominent in all the\r\ninternal contests of the kingdom, from the days of Alfred the Great\r\nto the reign of the third William. To this relic of a remote age the\r\npublic are freely admitted; and a courteous custodier is always at hand\r\nto detail its history, and conduct through its winding and tortuous\r\npaths from base to summit.\r\n\r\nDating from a time certainly anterior to the Conquest, before\r\nthe application of “villainous saltpetre,” it must have been\r\nimpregnable—commanding the adjacent country on all sides, and\r\nrendering the Arun a mere tributary to the will of its lords; it had\r\na large share in controlling the destinies of the kingdom during the\r\nseveral civil wars to which it had been subjected. It remains one of\r\nthe most picturesque of the ruins that in England recall the memories\r\nof battles lost and won, of glories continually claimed and resigned by\r\nrival competitors, and of heroes whose mortal parts have been dust from\r\nages so remote that their records are read only in “the dim twilight of\r\ntradition.”\r\n\r\nThe historian, Tierney, states that the Keep probably comprised\r\nthe principal feature of the Saxon stronghold. It is of a circular\r\nformation, and of immense strength. The height from the bottom of\r\nthe fosse, on the external side, was 70 feet; on the internal, 69;\r\nwhich, with walls and battlements, produced an elevation altogether of\r\n96 feet on the east; 103 on the west. The walls varied from 8 to 10\r\nfeet, strengthened by ribs and buttresses. The inner space, which is\r\ncircular, afforded accommodation to the garrison; in extent it varied\r\nfrom 59 to 67 feet in diameter. In the interior were several chambers,\r\nconverging towards a subterraneous room in the centre. Differing from\r\nother Keeps, it contained no openings or loopholes from which the enemy\r\ncould be annoyed, and it was only from the ramparts and battlements\r\nthat the garrison could repel the assaults of the assailant. No traces\r\ncan be seen of the original Saxon entrance.\r\n\r\nConnected with the Keep is, of course, the Well-tower. Bevis’s Tower,\r\nthe Barbican, is seen immediately underneath, while, at a short\r\ndistance, is “the Chapel of St. Mary, over the gate.”\r\n\r\nThe square building, known as the Clock Tower (introduced in the\r\nengraving), and through which a vaulted Norman passage leads to the\r\nKeep, dates from a period not long after the Conquest; parts of it\r\nbear unequivocal marks of so early an origin. The upper portion of the\r\nbuilding has been renovated; but the lower portion remains almost as\r\nperfect as when completed, as it is said to have been, by the first\r\nEarl of Arundel. “The passage abutted to the fosse, and was defended by\r\na portcullis and drawbridge.” A window is pointed out from which, A.D.\r\n1139, the Empress Maud, it is said, “scolded” the King, Stephen, who\r\nbesieged the castle in which she was a guest.\r\n\r\nThe CHURCH OF ST. MARTIN forms a portion of the Keep, and some relics\r\nof the ancient and venerable structure yet endure. It was the oratory\r\nof the garrison, and is “mentioned in Domesday Book as enjoying an\r\nannual rent of twelve pence, payable by one of the burgesses of\r\nArundel.” From a window of an early date is obtained a view of the\r\ncastle immediately beneath; but the prospect of the adjacent country is\r\nvery beautiful, not only of the fertile land and bountiful river, but\r\nof the far-off sea; and hours may be pleasantly and profitably spent\r\non this mount that time has hallowed. In bidding the pleasant theme\r\nfarewell, we cannot do better than quote the old rhyme:—\r\n\r\n  “Since William rose, and Harold fell,\r\n  There have been counts of Arundel;\r\n  And earls old Arundel shall have,\r\n  While rivers flow and forests wave.”\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to add that the grounds and park are worthy of\r\nthe castle; they are especially beautiful, varied in hill and dale—the\r\nfree river at their base—full of magnificently grown trees, and\r\ncomprise eleven hundred acres, well stocked with deer.\r\n\r\nIn the park, which was originally the hunting forest of the old Earls\r\nof Arundel, will be noticed Hiorn’s Tower—a triangular, turreted\r\nbuilding, of about 50 feet in height, and designed as a prospect tower\r\nby the architect whose name it bears. Near to it is Pugh-Dean, where,\r\nit is said, Bevis, the Great Castellan of Arundel, and his famous\r\nhorse, “Hirondelle,” are buried. A mound, covered with a clump of\r\nScotch fir-trees, is pointed out as his burial-place. Near this place,\r\ntoo, is the site of the old chapel and hermitage of St. James.\r\n\r\nThe old bridge over the river Arun was situated a short distance below\r\nthe present structure. It is first mentioned in the charter which\r\nQueen Adeliza granted to the monks of the Priory de Calceto, in which\r\nlands for their support, and an allowance of timber for repairs of the\r\nbridge, were granted. It was entirely rebuilt in 1724, principally of\r\nstone taken from the ruins of the adjoining hospital. In 1831 it was\r\nwidened and improved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Church of the Holy Trinity, Arundel._]\r\n\r\nThe CHURCH OF THE HOLY TRINITY. All that remains of this once famous\r\nestablishment is a square building “enclosing a square yard, partly\r\noccupied by cloisters, and partly devoted to other purposes of a\r\nmonastic establishment.” In it are some splendid monuments to members\r\nof the noble families who have owned the place. One of the principal is\r\nthat of Thomas, Earl of Arundel, and his countess, Beatrix, daughter of\r\nJohn, King of Portugal; and another striking feature is a canopied tomb\r\nnear the altar.\r\n\r\nThe CHURCH possesses many highly interesting features, and forms a\r\npleasing object in the landscape, from whichever side it is seen. It\r\nis cruciform, and consists of a nave with side aisles, a chancel,\r\nand transept; and in the centre rises a low tower, surmounted by a\r\ndiminutive spire.\r\n\r\nThe original ecclesiastical foundation was that of the alien priory, or\r\ncell, dedicated to St. Nicholas, established by Roger de Montgomery,\r\nEarl of Arundel, soon after the Conquest, and subjected to the\r\nBenedictine Abbey of Seez, or de Sagio, in Normandy. It consisted\r\nonly of a prior and three or four monks, who continued to conduct the\r\nestablishment for nearly three centuries, until the third year of the\r\nreign of Richard II., when Richard Fitzalan obtained a licence to\r\nextinguish the priory and to found a chantry for the maintenance of a\r\nmaster and twelve secular canons with their officers. Upon this change,\r\nit was styled “the Church of the Holy Trinity.” At the suppression, it\r\nwas endowed with a yearly revenue of £263 14_s._ 9_d._\r\n\r\nBeing intended as the mausoleum of his family, the founder supplied\r\nample means to enrich it with examples of monumental splendour. The\r\ntomb of his son, Thomas Fitzalan, and his wife, Beatrix, daughter of\r\nJohn, King of Portugal, was the earliest of those placed in the church.\r\nIt is of alabaster, finely sculptured, and was formerly painted and\r\ngilt. It contains the effigies of the earl and his lady; at the feet\r\nof the earl is a horse, the cognizance of the Fitzalans; and at those\r\nof his lady are two lap-dogs. Around, in niches, are small standing\r\nfigures of ecclesiastics, or pleureurs, with open books, as performing\r\nfuneral obsequies; and above them as many escutcheons. Other stately\r\ntombs are erected to the memory of John Fitzalan and his wife, and\r\nThomas Arundel and his wife, “one of the eyres of Richard Woodevyle,\r\nEarl Rivers, sister to Elizabeth, Queen of England, sometime wife to\r\nKing Edward IV.”\r\n\r\nThe chapel which contains these monuments is still in a dilapidated\r\nstate, as was the whole church—“ruinated” during the temporary\r\npossession of the Iconoclasts of the Commonwealth—until Henry Charles,\r\nDuke of Norfolk, restored it, and put upon it a roof, which it had long\r\nbeen without.\r\n\r\nVisitors to Arundel will note near the bridge some ancient ruins.\r\nAccording to the historian, Tierney, they are the remains of the\r\n_Maison Dieu_, that owed its origin to the same munificence as the\r\ncollegiate chapel and church. It formed a quadrangle, which was\r\noccupied by the chapel, refectory, and its offices, and the various\r\nchambers. There was a cloister round the court-yard. Quoting the\r\nstatutes, “the establishment,” says Mr. Tierney, “was to consist of\r\ntwenty poor men, either unmarried or widowers, who, from age, sickness\r\nor infirmity, were unable to provide for their own sustenance. They\r\nwere to be selected from among the most deserving of the surrounding\r\nneighbourhood, giving the preference only to the servants or tenants\r\nof the founder and his heirs; they were to be men of moral lives and\r\nedifying conversation, and were required, as a qualification for\r\ntheir admission, to know the ‘Pater Noster,’ the ‘Ave-Maria,’ and the\r\n‘Credo,’ in Latin.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Tombs of Thomas Fitzalan and Lady Beatrix, Arundel\r\nChurch._]\r\n\r\nThese buildings were dismantled at the time of the dissolution of the\r\nmonasteries, and no doubt suffered much at the time of the siege and\r\nsack of Arundel, during the Civil War, by the Parliamentarians under\r\nthe command of Sir William Waller; in 1724 a large quantity of the\r\nmaterials was used in the building of the bridge, that portion only\r\nbeing rescued which is now seen, and which has been preserved by the\r\nDuke of Norfolk because of the interest attached to the once sacred\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\nArundel, with its many attractions, is barely two hours distant from\r\nLondon, and within half an hour of populous Brighton; yet visits of\r\nstrangers to the old town and venerable castle are comparatively few.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPENSHURST.\r\n\r\n\r\nPENSHURST—the “Home” of the Sidneys—the stately Sidneys: stately\r\nin their character, in their careers, in their patriotism, in their\r\nheroism, in their rectitude, and in their verse—is surely one of the\r\nbest of the Stately Homes of England to be included in our series. The\r\nvery name of Penshurst seems to call up associations of no ordinary\r\ncharacter connected with that heroic race, and with many of the most\r\nstirring incidents of British history. With Penshurst every great\r\nname memorable in the Augustan age of England is linked for ever;\r\nwhile its venerable aspect, the solemnity of the surrounding shades,\r\nthe primitive character of its vicinity, together with its isolated\r\nposition—away from the haunts of busy men—are in harmony with the\r\nmemories it awakens.\r\n\r\nHere lived the earliest and bravest of the Anglo-Norman knights. Here\r\ndwelt the ill-fated Bohuns—the three unhappy Dukes of Buckingham,\r\nwho perished in succession, one in the field and two on the scaffold.\r\nAnd here flourished the Sidneys! Here, during his few brief years of\r\nabsence from turmoil in the turbulent countries of Ireland and Wales,\r\nresided the elder Sidney, Sir Henry, who, although his fame has been\r\neclipsed by the more dazzling reputation of his gallant son, was in all\r\nrespects good as well as great—a good soldier, a good subject, a good\r\nmaster, and a good counsellor and actor under circumstances peculiarly\r\nperilous. This is the birthplace of “the darling of his time,” the\r\n“chiefest jewel of a crown,” the “diamond of the court of Queen\r\nElizabeth.” Here, too, was born—and here was interred the mutilated\r\nbody of—the “later Sidney:” he who had “set up Marcus Brutus for his\r\npattern,” and perished on the scaffold—a martyr for the “good old\r\ncause,” one of the many victims of the meanest and most worthless of\r\nhis race. With the memories of these three marvellous men—the Sidneys,\r\nHenry, Philip, and Algernon—are closely blended those of the worthies\r\nof the two most remarkable eras in English history. Who can speak of\r\nPenshurst without thinking of Spenser,\r\n\r\n  (“For Sidney heard him sing, and knew his voice,”)\r\n\r\nof Shakspere, of Ben Jonson—the laureate of the place—of Raleigh,\r\nthe “friend and frequent guest” of Broke, whose proudest boast is\r\nrecorded on his tomb, that he was “the servant of Queen Elizabeth, the\r\ncounsellor of King James, and THE FRIEND of Sir Philip Sidney”—of the\r\nmany other immortal men who made the reign of Elizabeth the glory of\r\nall time? Reverting to a period less remote, who can think of Penshurst\r\nwithout speaking of the high spirits of a troubled age—\r\n\r\n  “The later Sidney, Marvel, Harrington,\r\n  Young Vane, and others, who called Milton—friend.”\r\n\r\nAlthough its glory is of the past, and nearly two centuries have\r\nintervened between the latest record of its greatness and its present\r\nstate; although it has been silent all that time—a solemn silence,\r\nbroken only by the false love-note of an unworthy minstrel, for the\r\nnames of “Waller” and “Sacharissa” discredit rather than glorify its\r\ngrey walls—who does not turn to Penshurst as to a refreshing fountain\r\nby the wayside of wearying history?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Penshurst, from the President’s Court._]\r\n\r\nThe history of the descent of Penshurst to the Sidneys may be summed\r\nup in few words—that of the Sidneys themselves will require greater\r\nspace. It was “the ancient seat of the Pencestres, or Penchesters, who\r\nsettled here in Norman times,[31] and one of whom was Sir Stephen, that\r\nfamous Lord Warden of the Five Ports, and Constable of Dover Castle,\r\nwho flourished in the reigns of Henry III. and Edward I., and who was a\r\nvery learned man, and ordered all the muniments, grants, &c., relating\r\nto Dover Castle to be written in a fair book, which he called _Castelli\r\nFeodarium_, and out of which Darell composed the history of that\r\nfortress.” Dying without male issue, his estates were divided between\r\nhis two daughters and co-heiresses, Joan, wife of Henry Cobham, and\r\nAlice, wife of John de Columbers, to the latter of whom fell Penshurst,\r\n&c., which was soon afterwards conveyed to Sir John de Poultney,\r\nwho (15th Edward II.) had license to embattle his mansion houses at\r\nPenshurst and elsewhere. He was four times Lord Mayor of London, and,\r\ndying, his widow “married Lovaines, and conveyed these estates into\r\nthat family with consent of her first husband’s immediate heirs;” and\r\nthey afterwards passed, by an heiress, to Sir Philip St. Clere, whose\r\nson sold them to the Regent Duke of Bedford. On his decease in Paris\r\nin the reign of Henry VI., Penshurst and other manors passed to his\r\nnext brother, Humphrey, the “good Duke of Gloucester,” after whose\r\nsad death, in 1447, they reverted to the crown, and were, in that same\r\nyear, granted to the Staffords. On the attainder of Edward, Duke of\r\nBuckingham, Penshurst reverted to the Crown.\r\n\r\nThat brilliant nobleman—whose principal crimes were his wealth,\r\nhis open, manly, and generous nature, and his wise criticisms of\r\nthe ruinous expenditure on the “field of the cloth of gold”—was\r\ntreacherously invited to court by the king, and, suspecting no\r\nmischief, he obeyed the summons, and set out on his journey from\r\nThornbury, not observing for some time that he was closely followed\r\nby three knights of the king’s body-guard, “and a secret power of\r\nservants-at-arms.” His suspicions were first awakened at Windsor, where\r\nhe lodged for the night, “the same three knights lying close by,” and\r\nwhere he was treated with marked disrespect by the king’s gentleman\r\nharbinger. From Windsor, Buckingham rode on to Westminster, and then\r\ntook his barge to row down to Greenwich, where the court then was,\r\ncalling, however, on his way, at York House, to see Cardinal Wolsey,\r\nwho was denied to him. “Well, yet will I drink of my lord cardinal’s\r\nwine as I pass,” said the duke: “and then a gentleman of my lord\r\ncardinal’s brought the duke with much reverence into the cellar, where\r\nthe duke drank; but when he saw and perceived no cheer to him was made,\r\nhe changed colour, and departed.” Passing forward down the Thames,\r\nas he neared the City, his barge was hailed and boarded by Sir Henry\r\nMarney, captain of the body-guard, who, in the king’s name, attached\r\nhim as a traitor. He was at once carried on shore and taken through\r\nThames Street to the Tower, “to the great astonishment and regret of\r\nthe people, to whom he was justly endeared.” This was on the 16th of\r\nApril, 1521. On the 13th of May he was put on his mock trial and was\r\ncondemned. “I shall never sue the king for life,” said he; and he kept\r\nhis word. On the 17th he was executed, without having once supplicated\r\nhis brutal king to spare the life he was unjustly taking away. “He\r\nwas as undaunted in sight of the block as he had been before his\r\njudges; and he died as brave men die—firmly and meekly, and without\r\nbravado.” His death was the grief of the people. “God have mercy on his\r\nsoul, for he was a most wise and noble prince, and the mirrour of all\r\ncourtesie”—that was written of him at the time.\r\n\r\nBy this detestable piece of royal treachery Henry became possessed\r\nof the estates of the duke, and held them in his own hands for\r\nseveral years, enlarging Penshurst Park, and reaping benefit from\r\nhis unhallowed acquisitions. By Edward VI., Penshurst, with its\r\nappurtenances, was “granted to Sir Ralph Fane, who, within two years,\r\nwas executed as an accomplice of the Protector Somerset.”\r\n\r\nSoon after this, the young monarch gave Penshurst, with other adjoining\r\nestates, to Sir William Sidney, one of the heroes of Flodden Field,\r\n“who had been his tutor, chamberlain, and steward of his household from\r\nhis birth to his coronation.” Thus Penshurst came into the family of\r\nthe Sidneys, concerning whom we will proceed to give some particulars.\r\n\r\nThe earliest member of the family of whom aught authentic is known\r\nis Sir William Sidney, who lived in the reign of Stephen. His son,\r\nSir Simon (1213), married Margaret, daughter of Sir Thomas Delamere;\r\nand their son again, Sir Roger (1239), married Eleanor, daughter of\r\nSir John Sopham, by whom he had issue two sons, Sir Henry (1268), who\r\nsucceeded him, and Simon; and a daughter, married to Sir John Wales.\r\nSir Henry Sidney married Maud, daughter of Robert d’Abernon, and\r\ngranddaughter of Sir John d’Abernon. By her he had issue four sons and\r\ntwo daughters, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Sir Henry Sidney,\r\nwho, marrying a daughter of Sir Ralph Hussey, died in 1306, and was\r\nsucceeded by his son, Sir William Sidney, who took to wife Elizabeth,\r\ndaughter of Sir Richard Ashburnham, by whom he had three sons, viz.:\r\nWilliam, who married a daughter of John de Altaripa, but died without\r\nheirs male; John, who died young; and another John, who succeeded him,\r\nand marrying Helen, daughter of Robert Batisford, was the father, by\r\nher, of Sir William Sidney. This Sir William took to wife Joanna,\r\ndaughter of William Brokhull, who married, first, Margaret Orre, and\r\nsecond, Isabell. By his first wife he had issue two sons, John, who\r\nsucceeded him, and William (of whom presently). This John Sidney had\r\na son John, who married Isabell Payteuine, by whom he had an only\r\ndaughter and heiress Johanna, who married William Appesley. William\r\nSydney, by his wife, Alicia, daughter and heiress of John Clumford,\r\nhad one son, William, and four daughters. This William Sidney married\r\nCicely, daughter and co-heiress of Sir John Michell, and Margaret, his\r\nwife, who was daughter and heiress of Matham. He was succeeded by his\r\nson, William Sidney, who married twice. By his first wife, Isabell St.\r\nJohn, he had a son, William, whose line ended in co-heiresses, married\r\nto William Vuedall and John Hampden; and by his second wife, Thomasen,\r\ndaughter and heiress of John Barrington, and widow of Lonsford (and\r\nwho, after Sidney’s death, became wife of Lord Hopton), he had issue\r\na son, Nicholas Sidney, who married Anne, cousin and co-heiress of\r\nCharles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _North and West Fronts._]\r\n\r\nBy her he had a son, Sir William Sidney, who married Anne, daughter of\r\nHugh Pagenham, and by her had, besides Sir Henry, who succeeded him,\r\nfour daughters, viz.: Frances, who became Countess of Sussex by her\r\nmarriage to Thomas Ratcliffe, Earl of Sussex, Viscount Fitzwalter,\r\nLord Egremont and Burnell, Lord Chamberlain, Knight of the Garter, and\r\none of the Privy Council; Mary, married to Sir William Dormer; Lucy,\r\nmarried to Sir James Harrington; and Anne, married to Sir William\r\nFitzwilliam. This Sir William Sidney was made a knight, 3rd Henry\r\nVIII., at the burning of Conquest, and a banneret on Flodden Field,\r\n5th Henry VIII. He was chamberlain to Prince Edward (afterwards Edward\r\nVI.), and also steward of his household; and his wife was “governesse\r\nof the sayd prince while he was in his nurse’s handes.” To him it\r\nwas that Penshurst was given by Edward VI. as a mark of affectionate\r\nregard. Dying in 1553, he was succeeded by his son, Sir Henry Sidney,\r\nwho was a Knight of the Garter, Lord President of Wales, and one of the\r\nPrivy Council; he married Lady Mary, eldest daughter of John, Duke of\r\nNorthumberland, and by her had issue “the incomparable” Sir Philip,\r\nand two other sons, Robert and Thomas, and a daughter, Mary, married\r\nto Henry Herbert, Earl of Pembroke. This Henry Sidney was knighted,\r\n3rd Edward VI., and was, when only twenty-two years of age, sent by\r\nthat amiable young monarch as ambassador to the French court. Under\r\nQueen Mary he was Lord Treasurer of Ireland, and Lord Chief Justice,\r\nand under Elizabeth was, in 1564, made Lord President of the Council in\r\nthe Marches of Wales; Knight of the Garter in 1564; and was twice Lord\r\nDeputy of Ireland and Lord President of Wales.\r\n\r\nSir Henry Sidney had been brought up and educated with Edward VI.,\r\n“being companion and many times the bedfellow of the prince;” and\r\nthat young king died in his arms. This death so affected Sir Henry,\r\n“that he returned to Penshurst to indulge his melancholy. Here he soon\r\nafterwards sheltered the ruined family of his father-in-law, the Duke\r\nof Northumberland, in whose fall he would in all probability have been\r\nimplicated but for his retirement.” He died at Ludlow, the seat of his\r\ngovernment, in 1586—his heart being there buried, but his body was\r\ninterred with great solemnity, by the queen’s order, at Penshurst. The\r\nconcurring testimony of all historians and biographers, such as Camden,\r\nSir Richard Cox, Campian (in his “History of Ireland”), Hollinshed,\r\nAnthony-à-Wood, and Lloyd (in his “State Worthies”), proves the\r\nextraordinary courage, abilities, and virtue of Sir Henry Sidney. These\r\nqualities made him the most direct and clear politician. He seems to\r\nhave been incapable of intrigue and the supple arts of the court. “His\r\ndispatches are full, open, and manly; and Ireland, and perhaps Wales,\r\nto this day experience the good effects of his wise government.”\r\n\r\n“As the father was, so was the son;” the son being Sir Philip Sidney,\r\nto whom we have alluded. Sir Philip was born at Penshurst, November\r\n29th, 1554. His life was one scene of romance from its commencement to\r\nits close. His early years were spent in travel; and on his return he\r\nwas married to the daughter of Sir Francis Walsingham, a lady of many\r\naccomplishments, and of “extraordinary handsomeness,” but his heart was\r\ngiven to another. The Lady Penelope Devereux won it, and kept it till\r\nhe fell on the field of Zutphen. Family regards had forbidden their\r\nmarriage, but she was united to the immortal part of him, and that\r\ncontract has not yet been dissolved. She is still the Philoclea of the\r\n“Arcadia,” and Stella in the poems of “Astrophel.” It is unnecessary\r\nto follow in detail the course of Sir Philip Sidney’s life. There is\r\nno strange inconsistency to reason off, no stain to clear, no blame to\r\ntalk away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _View from the Garden._]\r\n\r\nWe describe it when we name his accomplishments; we remember it as\r\nwe would a dream of uninterrupted glory. His learning, his beauty,\r\nhis chivalry, his grace, shed a lustre on the most glorious reign\r\nrecorded in the English annals. England herself, “by reason of the\r\nwidespread fame of Sir Philip Sidney,” rose exalted in the eyes of\r\nforeign nations—he was the idol, the darling of his own. For with\r\nevery sort of power at his command, it was his creed to think all\r\nvain but affection and honour, and to hold the simplest and cheapest\r\npleasures the truest and most precious. The only displeasure he ever\r\nincurred at court was when he vindicated the rights and independence of\r\nEnglish commoners in his own gallant person against the arrogance of\r\nEnglish nobles in the person of the Earl of Oxford. For a time, then,\r\nhe retired from the court, and sought rest in his loved simplicity. He\r\nwent to Wilton; and there, for the amusement of his dear sister, Mary,\r\nCountess of Pembroke, he wrote, between the years 1579 and 1581, the\r\n“Arcadia,” a work whose strange fortune it has been to be too highly\r\nvalued in one age, and far too underrated in another. Immediately\r\nafter its publication it was received with unbounded applause. “From\r\nit was taken the language of compliment and love; it gave a tinge of\r\nsimilitude to the colloquial and courtly dialect of the time; and\r\nfrom thence its influence was communicated to the lucubrations of the\r\npoet, the historian, and the divine.” The book is a mixture of what\r\nhas been termed the heroic and the pastoral romance, interspersed\r\nwith interludes and episodes, and details the various and marvellous\r\nadventures of two friends, Musidorus and Pyrocles. It was not intended\r\nto be published to the world, but was written merely to pleasure the\r\nCountess of Pembroke—“a principal ornament to the family of the\r\nSidneys.” The famous epitaph, usually ascribed to the pen of Ben\r\nJonson, though in reality, it appears, written by William Browne, the\r\nauthor of “Britannia’s Pastorals,” and preserved in a MS. volume of his\r\npoems in the Lansdowne Collection in the British Museum, although so\r\nwell known, will bear repeating here:—\r\n\r\n  “Underneath this sable hearse\r\n  Lies the subject of all verse,\r\n  _Sidney’s_ sister! _Pembroke’s_ mother\r\n  Death, ere thou hast slain another\r\n  Fair, and learn’d, and good as she,\r\n  Time shall throw a dart at thee!\r\n  Marble piles let no man raise\r\n  To her name for after-days;\r\n  Some kind woman, born as she,\r\n  Reading this, like Niobe,\r\n  Shall turn marble, and become\r\n  Both her mourner and her tomb.”\r\n\r\nAgain, however, Sidney returned to court, and his queen seized every\r\nopportunity to do him honour. He received her smiles with the same high\r\nand manly gallantry, the same plain and simple boldness, with which\r\nhe had taken her frowns. In the end, Elizabeth, who, to preserve this\r\n“jewel of her crown,” had forcibly laid hands on him when he projected\r\na voyage to America with Sir Francis Drake, and placed her veto on his\r\nquitting England when he was offered the crown of Poland, could not\r\nrestrain his bravery in battle when circumstances called him there. At\r\nZutphen, on the 22nd of September, 1586, he received a mortal wound;\r\nand here occurred the touching incident to which, perhaps, more than\r\nto any other circumstance, Sir Philip is indebted for his heroic fame.\r\nIt is thus related by his friend and biographer, Fulke Greville, Lord\r\nBroke:—“In his sad progress, passing along by the rest of the army,\r\nwhere his uncle, the general, was, and being thirsty from excess of\r\nbleeding, he called for drink, which was presently brought him; but, as\r\nhe was putting the bottle to his mouth, he saw a poor soldier carried\r\nalong, who had been wounded at the same time, ghastly, casting up his\r\neyes at the bottle; which Sir Philip perceiving, took it from his head\r\nbefore he drank, and delivered to the poor man with these words: ‘Thy\r\nnecessity is yet greater than mine.’ He lived in great pain for many\r\ndays after he was wounded, and died on the 17th of October, 1586.” The\r\nclose of his life affords a beautiful lesson. “Calmly and steadily he\r\nawaited the approach of death. His prayers were long and fervent; his\r\nbearing was indeed that of a Christian hero.” He had a noble funeral;\r\nkings clad themselves in garments of grief: a whole people grieved for\r\nthe loss of the most accomplished scholar, the most graceful courtier,\r\nthe best soldier, and the worthiest man of the country and the age.\r\nHe was buried in state, in the old Cathedral of St. Paul, on the 16th\r\nof February. Both Universities composed verses to his memory, and so\r\ngeneral was the mourning for him, that, “for many months after his\r\ndeath, it was accounted indecent for any gentleman of quality to appear\r\nat court or in the city in any light or gaudy apparel.”\r\n\r\nWe may place implicit faith in the testimony of the contemporaries of\r\nSir Philip Sidney; and by all of them he is described as very near\r\nperfection. Their praises must have been as sincere as they were\r\nhearty; for his fortune was too poor to furnish him with the means\r\nto purchase them with other than gifts of kindly zeal, affectionate\r\nsympathy, cordial advice, and generous recommendations to more\r\nprosperous men. From Spenser himself we learn that Sidney\r\n\r\n  “First did lift my muse out of the floor.”\r\n\r\nIn his dedication of the “Ruins of Time” to Sidney’s sister, he speaks\r\nof her brother as “the hope of all learned men, and the patron of my\r\nyoung muse.” “He was,” writes Camden, “the great glory of his family,\r\nthe great hope of mankind, the most lively pattern of virtue, and the\r\ndarling of the learned world.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Baron’s Court._]\r\n\r\nSir Philip, dying without issue, was succeeded by his brother, Sir\r\nRobert Sidney, who was created Lord Sidney of Penshurst, and afterwards\r\nViscount Lisle and Earl of Leicester, and a Knight of the Garter, by\r\nJames I. He died at Penshurst in July, 1626, and was succeeded in his\r\ntitle and estates by his son, Robert, as second Earl of Leicester. This\r\nnobleman was “several times ambassador to foreign courts, and in 1641\r\nwas appointed Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, but, through some unfounded\r\naspersions cast against his fidelity and honour, he was never permitted\r\nto seat himself in his new station, and was ultimately dispossessed of\r\nit.” He retired in disgust to Penshurst, where he spent his time in\r\nliterary retirement, for he was well read in the classics, and spoke\r\nLatin, French, Italian, and Spanish, and purchased most of the curious\r\nbooks in those languages, “and several learned men made him presents\r\nof their works.” He remained in retirement at Penshurst during the\r\ndomination of the Parliament and the rule of the Protector, and died\r\nthere in November, 1677, in the eighty-second year of his age. His\r\nlordship, who married the Lady Dorothea Percy, had fourteen children,\r\nsix sons and eight daughters. His eldest son, Philip, succeeded to the\r\ntitle and estates, and lived in troubled times the life of an easy\r\ngentleman. Not so the second son, Algernon, the famous scion of the\r\nSidneys, whose name is scarcely less renowned in history than that of\r\nhis great-uncle, Sir Philip. Of the daughters, Lady Dorothea became\r\nCountess of Sunderland, and she was the famous “Sacharissa” of the poet\r\nWaller. Waller wooed her in vain; she estimated the frivolous poet\r\nat his true value. He called her “Sacharissa—a name, as he used to\r\nsay pleasantly, derived from _saccharum_, sugar.” Sacharissa and her\r\nlover met long after the spring of life, and on her asking him “when\r\nhe would write such fine verses on her again?” the poet ungallantly\r\nreplied, “Oh, madam, when you are as young again!” Algernon Sidney\r\nwas born at Penshurst, in 1621. He had scarcely reached the age of\r\nmanhood when he was called upon to play his part in the mighty drama\r\nthen acting before the world. He joined the Parliament, and became a\r\nbusy soldier—serving with repute in Ireland, where he was “some time\r\nLieutenant-General of the Horse and Governor of Dublin,” until Cromwell\r\nassumed the position of a sovereign, when Sidney retired in disgust to\r\nthe family seat in Kent, and began to write his celebrated “Discourses\r\non Government.” At the Restoration he was abroad, and “being so noted\r\na republican,” thought it unsafe to return to England; for seventeen\r\nyears after this event he was a wanderer throughout Europe, suffering\r\nsevere privations, “exposed (according to his own words) to all those\r\ntroubles, inconveniences, and mischiefs into which they are liable who\r\nhave nothing to subsist upon, in a place farre from home, wheare no\r\nassistance can possibly be expected, and wheare I am known to be of a\r\nquality which makes all lowe and meane wayes of living shamefull and\r\ndetestible.” The school of adversity failed to subdue the proud spirit\r\nof the republican; and on his return to his native country, 1677, at\r\nthe entreaty of his father, “who desired to see him before he died,”\r\nthe “later Sidney” became a marked man, whom the depraved Charles and\r\nhis minions were resolved to sacrifice. He was accused of high treason,\r\nimplicated in the notorious Rye House Plot, carried through a form of\r\ntrial on the 21st of November, and beheaded on Tower Hill on the 8th of\r\nDecember, 1683. His execution was a judicial murder.\r\n\r\nPhilip, third earl, lived to a great age, eighty-two, and dying in\r\n1696, was succeeded by his grandson, John, who, dying unmarried, was\r\nsucceeded successively by two of his brothers; the last earl, Jocelyn,\r\ndied in 1748, without any legitimate issue. He, however, left a natural\r\ndaughter, afterwards married to Mr. Streatfield, to whom he devised the\r\nwhole of his estates. His next elder brother, Colonel Thomas Sidney,\r\nwho died before him, had, however, left two daughters, to whom the\r\nestate properly devolved as co-heiresses; and after a long course\r\nof litigation their right was established, and the guardians of the\r\nyoung lady found it necessary to consent to a compromise (sanctioned\r\nby Act of Parliament) with the husbands of the two co-heiresses. In\r\nthe division of the property, Penshurst passed to the younger of the\r\nco-heiresses, Elizabeth, wife of William Perry, Esq. (who assumed the\r\nname of Sidney), of Turville Park, Buckinghamshire, who repaired the\r\nmansion, and added to its collection of pictures. He died in 1757, and\r\nhis widow, Mrs. Perry-Sidney, was left in sole possession. This lady,\r\nafter the death of her elder sister, Lady Sherrard, purchased most of\r\nthe family estates which had fallen to that lady’s share. A claim to\r\nthe estates and title of Earl of Leicester was made by a son of the\r\ncountess of the last earl (Jocelyn), born after her separation from her\r\nhusband, but was unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nMrs. Perry-Sidney had an only son, Algernon Perry-Sidney, who died\r\nduring her lifetime, but left two daughters, his and her co-heiresses,\r\nto the elder of whom, Elizabeth, who was married to Bysshe Shelley,\r\nEsq., Penshurst passed. Their son, Sir John Shelley Sidney, Bart.,\r\ninherited Penshurst and the manors and estates in Kent; he was created\r\na baronet in 1818. He was succeeded as second baronet by his son, Sir\r\nPhilip Charles Sidney, D.C.L., G.C.H., &c., who was an equerry to\r\nthe king. He was born in 1800, and in 1825 married the Lady Sophia\r\nFitzclarence, one of the daughters of his Majesty King William IV. and\r\nMrs. Jordan, and sister to the Earl of Munster. In 1835 he was raised\r\nto the peerage by William IV., by the title of Baron de L’Isle and\r\nDudley. By his wife, the Lady Sophia Fitzclarence (who died in 1837),\r\nhis lordship had issue one son, the present peer, and three daughters,\r\nthe Honourable Adelaide Augusta Wilhelmina, married to her cousin, the\r\nHonourable Frederick Charles George Fitzclarence (who has assumed the\r\nname of Hunlocke), son of the first Earl of Munster; the Honourable\r\nErnestine Wellington, married to Philip Percival, Esq.; and the\r\nHonourable Sophia Philippa.\r\n\r\nThe present noble owner of Penshurst, Philip Sidney, second Baron de\r\nL’Isle and Dudley, and a baronet, was born in 1828. He was educated\r\nat Eton, and was an officer in the Royal Horse Guards. He is a\r\nDeputy-Lieutenant of Kent and of Yorkshire, and Hereditary Visitor\r\nof Sidney-Sussex College, Cambridge. His lordship, who succeeded his\r\nfather in 1851, married, in 1850, Mary, only daughter of Sir William\r\nFoulis, Bart., of Ingleby Manor, and has issue living, by her, four\r\nsons, the Honourable Philip, the heir-presumptive to the title, born\r\n1853; the Honourable Algernon, born 1854: the Honourable Henry, born\r\n1858; and the Honourable William, born 1859; and one daughter, the\r\nHonourable Mary Sophia, born 1851.\r\n\r\nThe arms of Lord de L’Isle and Dudley are, quarterly, first and fourth,\r\n_or_, a phoon, _azure_, for Sidney; second and third, _sable_, on\r\na fesse engrailed, between three whelk shells, _or_, a mullet for\r\ndifference, for Shelley. Crests, first, a porcupine, statant, _azure_,\r\nquills collar and chain, _or_, for Sidney; second, a griffin’s head\r\nerased, _argent_, ducally gorged, _or_, for Shelley. Supporters,\r\ndexter, a porcupine, _azure_, quills collar and chain, _or_; sinister,\r\na lion, queue fourchée, _vert_. Motto: “Quo Fata Vocant.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Village and Entrance to Churchyard._]\r\n\r\nPENSHURST, or, as it is called, Penshurst House, or Castle, or Place,\r\n“the seat of the Sidneys,” adjoins the village to which it gives a\r\nname. It is situated in the weald of Kent, nearly six miles south-west\r\nof Tunbridge, and about thirty miles from London. The neighbourhood\r\nis remarkably primitive. As an example of the prevailing character\r\nof the houses, we have copied a group that stands at the entrance of\r\nthe churchyard—a small cluster of quiet cottages (recently, however,\r\nrebuilt upon the old model), behind which repose the rude forefathers\r\nof the hamlet, with brave knights of imperishable renown, and near\r\nwhich is an elm of prodigious size and age, that has seen generations\r\nafter generations flourish and decay. The sluggish Medway creeps lazily\r\nround the park, which consists of about 400 acres, finely wooded, and\r\nhappily diversified with hill and dale. A double row of beech-trees of\r\nsome extent preserves the name of “Sacharissa’s Walk,” and a venerable\r\noak, called “Sidney’s Oak,” the trunk of which is hollowed by time, is\r\npointed out as the veritable tree that was planted on the day of Sir\r\nPhilip’s birth; of which Rare Ben Jonson thus writes:—\r\n\r\n  “That taller tree of which a nut we set\r\n  At his great birth when all the muses met;”—\r\n\r\nto which Waller makes reference as “the sacred mark of noble Sidney’s\r\nbirth;” concerning which Southey also has some lines; and from which a\r\nhost of lesser poets have drawn inspiration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Record Tower and the Church, from the Garden._]\r\n\r\nUntil within the last thirty or forty years Penshurst House was in a\r\nsadly dilapidated state. Its utter ruin, indeed, appeared a settled\r\nthing, until Lord de L’Isle set himself to the task of its restoration,\r\nand under his admirable direction it rapidly assumed its ancient\r\ncharacter—a combination of several styles of architecture, in which\r\nthe Tudor predominated. One of our views is of the mansion, from the\r\nprincipal approach through the park. In another view the west front\r\nis shown, the north front being seen in short perspective; on the\r\nleft is “Sir Henry’s Tower,” containing his arms, and an inscription\r\nstating that he was “Lord Deputie General of the Realm of Ireland in\r\n1579.” This tower terminates the north wing, in which is the principal\r\nentrance, by an ancient gateway, leading through one of the smaller\r\ncourts to the great hall. Over this gateway is an antique slab, setting\r\nforth that “The most religious and renowned Prince, Edward the Sixt,\r\nKinge of England, France, and Ireland, gave this house of Pencestre\r\nwith the manors, landes and appurtenaynces thereunto belonginge to,\r\nunto his trustye and well-beloved servant, Syr William Sidney, Knight\r\nBanneret.”\r\n\r\nWe cannot do better than ask our readers to accompany Mr. Parker in\r\nhis tour through the house. Ascending the staircase on one side of\r\nthe hall, the company passed through the solar or lord’s chamber, at\r\none end of which Mr. Parker thought the chapel had been originally\r\nscreened off, and that it was changed into a ball-room in the reign\r\nof Queen Anne. The Buckingham Building, which was next visited, was\r\nfound to have been admirably restored, although it had fallen into a\r\nsad state of ruin. Fragments of one of the old windows, however, were\r\ndiscovered, and these enabled the architect to restore it completely.\r\nMr. Parker considered it to be one of the most beautiful instances of\r\nrestoration he had seen. It gave a most vivid idea of its original\r\nstate. The company then descended into the lower chamber or parlour of\r\nthe house of the time of Edward III., which was perfectly preserved,\r\nand an excellent example of a mediæval vaulted substructure. Passing to\r\nthe Elizabethan house, the company entered a suite of rooms elegantly\r\nfurnished, and containing many exceedingly interesting objects. The\r\nchairs were of the time of Charles II., of English manufacture, and\r\nthe best specimens of that date that could be found. There were also\r\na couch of the same period, and an Augsburg clock of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, some very old and valuable paintings, and choice cabinets\r\nof carved ebony. Among other curiosities was an illustration of the\r\nfuneral procession of Sir Philip Sidney. Mr. Parker then drew attention\r\nto the exterior architectural style of the Buckingham Building, added\r\nin the time of Richard II., and admirably restored by the architect.\r\nThe recent restoration of the Elizabethan Building had also been ably\r\ndone. The windows were especially noticeable, by the skilful manner\r\nin which the work had been executed after the style of fragments\r\nof the old work. The Elizabethan front was also an object of much\r\ninterest. The exterior architecture in the servants’ court was a noble\r\ncomposition, full of interest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Hall and Minstrels’ Gallery._]\r\n\r\nThus the “restorations” have been made in good taste and with sound\r\njudgment; and the seat of the Sidneys has regained its rank as one of\r\nthe finest and most extensive edifices in the county of Kent.\r\n\r\nIn the interior the “Hall” is remarkably fine and interesting, with\r\ngood architectural features. The pointed timber roof, upon which the\r\nslates are laid, is supported by a series of grotesque life-size\r\ncorbels; and the screen of the gallery is richly carved and panelled.\r\nThe gallery—“The Minstrels’ Gallery”—fills the side opposite the\r\ndais, and the Gothic windows are narrow and lofty. Every object,\r\nindeed, calls to mind and illustrates the age of feudalism. The oak\r\ntables, on which retainers feasted, still occupy the hall, and in its\r\ncentre are the huge dogs in an octagonal enclosure, beneath the louvre,\r\nor lanthorn, in the roof, which formerly permitted egress to the smoke.\r\n\r\n“On each side of the hall,” writes Mr. Parker, “were two tables and\r\nbenches, which, if not actually contemporaneous with it, were certainly\r\namong the earliest pieces of furniture remaining in England. There was\r\nno doubt a similar—or probably a more ornamental—one on the daïs at\r\nthe upper end of the hall where the Elizabethan table now stood, which\r\nwas used by the lord and his more honoured guests, the side tables in\r\nthe lower part of the hall being for the domestics and retainers, and\r\nguests of that class. One end of the daïs had been altered, so that the\r\noriginal arrangement could not be seen; but there would necessarily\r\nbe at one end the sideboard, or buffet, filled with plate, arranged\r\non shelves to be well displayed, whilst it also formed a sort of\r\ncupboard, with doors which could be closed and locked. This piece of\r\nfurniture was usually placed in the recess formed by a bay window in\r\nhalls of the fifteenth century, but it was doubtful whether the bay\r\nwindow was in use as early as the fourteenth. At the opposite end of\r\nthe daïs was the door to the staircase of the solar or upper chamber,\r\nused as the withdrawing-room for the ladies after dinner; and by its\r\nside there was another door leading to the cellar. This was originally\r\nthe lower chamber under the solar, but afterwards there was often a\r\nshort passage to the cellar, which was sometimes underground, and the\r\noriginal cellar, or lower chamber, became the parlour. But there were\r\nalways two chambers, one over the other, behind the daïs, the two\r\ntogether often not reaching so high as the roof of the hall. The upper\r\nroom was the lord’s chamber, from which there was usually a look-out\r\ninto the hall, as a check to the more riotous proceedings after the\r\nlord and his family or his guests had retired; or for the lords to\r\nsee that the guests were assembled before descending with his family\r\ninto the hall. In the centre of the hall was the original hearth or\r\nreredos, almost the only one, he believed, remaining. By the side of it\r\nwere the andirons, or fire-dogs, for arranging logs of wood upon the\r\nhearth, and over it was an opening in the roof, with a small ornamented\r\nturret to cover it, called a smoke-louvre, which unfortunately had\r\nbeen removed, after having been previously Italianised and spoilt. The\r\ncustom of having a large fire of logs of wood in the hall continued\r\nlong after fire-places and chimneys were used in the other chambers;\r\nand it was a mistake to suppose that they were unknown in this country\r\nuntil the fifteenth century. There were many fire-places and chimneys\r\nof the twelfth and thirteenth centuries in the chambers, but it was not\r\ncustomary to use them in the hall before the fifteenth. In spite of all\r\nthe modern contrivances for warming rooms, it might be doubted whether\r\nfor warming a large and lofty hall it was possible to obtain more heat\r\nfrom the same quantity of fuel than was obtained from the open fire,\r\nand where the space was so large and the roof so high that no practical\r\ninconvenience could be felt from the smoke, which naturally ascended\r\nand escaped by the louvre.”\r\n\r\nLeaving the hall, the Ball-room is entered; it is long and narrow,\r\nthe walls being covered with family portraits—some original, some\r\ncopies. Queen Elizabeth’s room succeeds: it contains much of the\r\nfurniture, tapestry-covered, that was placed there when the virgin\r\nqueen visited the mansion. In one corner is an ancient mandoline; some\r\nportraits of the chiefs of the heroic race are here; and here is a\r\nsingular picture, representing Queen Elizabeth dancing with the Earl of\r\nLeicester. The family portraits are gathered in the “Picture Gallery;”\r\nit contains no others; none but a member of it has been admitted with\r\none exception—that of Edward VI., who gave the estate to the Sidneys.\r\nAmong them are several of Sir Philip and Algernon Sidney, one of Sir\r\nPhilip’s sister, the Countess of Pembroke, to whom he addressed the\r\n“Arcadia,” and who is immortalised in the epitaph we have just given,\r\nand one by Lely of the “Sacharissa” of the muse of Waller. A small\r\nchamber in the mansion contains, however, a few treasures of rarer\r\nvalue than all its copies of “fair women and brave men.” Among some\r\ncurious family relics and records is a lock of Sir Philip Sidney’s\r\nhair; it is of a pale auburn. A lock of the hair of the ill-fated\r\nAlgernon is also with it, and in tint nearly resembles that of his\r\nillustrious great-uncle.\r\n\r\nThere are many other relics of interest and value scattered throughout\r\nthe mansion, but towards the close of the last century a grand\r\ncollection of ancient armour, worn by generations of the Sidneys,\r\nrichly emblazoned and inlaid, was sold as old iron that cumbered\r\none of the rooms of the house; while MSS. of inestimable worth,\r\nincluding correspondence with the leading worthies of many centuries,\r\nmysteriously disappeared, and were probably consumed as waste paper,\r\nuseful only for lighting fires.\r\n\r\nThe church at Penshurst is dedicated to St. John the Baptist. It\r\nimmediately adjoins the park, and is connected, by a private walk,\r\nwith the gardens of the mansion. It is an ancient and very venerable\r\nstructure, containing many monuments to the Sidneys, and to members of\r\nthe families of Dragnowt, Cambridge, Egerton, Head, Darkenol, Pawle,\r\nand Yden. The most interesting and beautifully wrought of the tombs is\r\nto the memory of Sir William Sidney, Knight Banneret, Chamberlain and\r\nSteward to Edward VI., and Lord of the Manor of Penshurst, who died\r\nin 1553. It stands in a small chapel at the west end of the chancel,\r\nand at the foot of the tomb is a very antique figure, carved in\r\nmarble, supposed to be a memorial to Sir Stephen de Pencestre. Below\r\nis the vault which contains the dust of generations of the Sidneys.\r\nSir William Sidney’s monument is a fine example of art, elaborately\r\nand delicately sculptured; it contains a long inscription, engraved\r\non a brass tablet, the lettering in which is as clear and as sharp\r\nas if it were the work of yesterday. The roof of this chapel is\r\npeculiarly light and elegant. In both exterior and interior it is\r\nhighly picturesque. The oak gallery is one of the earliest erections\r\nof the kind that followed the Reformation. Mr. Parker, in his address\r\nto the Archæological Society, thus spoke of the church:—“It exhibited\r\nspecimens of the architecture of various periods, and is interesting as\r\nthe burial-place of the ancient families that inhabited the mansion.\r\nThe north side was of the time of Henry III., and was probably built by\r\nSir Stephen Penchester; the south side in the time of Edward III. The\r\nchancel chapel at the end of the south aisle was the burial-place of\r\nthe Pulteney family. There were also two chantry chapels on the north\r\nside, one of the time of Edward I., and the other of the time of Henry\r\nVI. Amongst the other interesting monuments and tablets there is one\r\ncommemorative of the late illustrious Lord Hardinge.”\r\n\r\nIn all respects, therefore, a visit to PENSHURST—now by railroad\r\nwithin an hour’s distance of the metropolis—may be described as a\r\nrare intellectual treat, opening a full and brilliant page of history,\r\nabundant in sources of profitable enjoyment to the antiquary, affording\r\na large recompense to the lover or the professor of Art, and exhibiting\r\nnature under a vast variety of aspects.[32]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWARWICK CASTLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWARWICK CASTLE holds foremost rank among the Stately Homes of England,\r\nboth from its historical associations, and the important positions\r\nwhich, in every age, its lords have occupied in the annals of our\r\ncountry. Situated in one of the most romantic and beautiful districts\r\nof a fertile and productive shire, overlooking the “sweet-flowing\r\nAvon,” and retaining all its characteristics of former strength and\r\ngrandeur, Warwick Castle is renowned among the most interesting\r\nremains of which the kingdom can boast. Of its original foundation,\r\nlike that of other of our older strongholds, nothing is really known,\r\nalthough much is surmised. It is said to have been a Celtic settlement,\r\nconverted into a fortress by the Roman invaders. However this may\r\nbe—and there were several ancient British and Roman roads and stations\r\nin the county—it is not our purpose to inquire. It will suffice to\r\nsay that at the time of the Roman conquest of Warwickshire, which is\r\nsaid to have occurred about the year 50, the county was occupied by\r\ntwo tribes of ancient Britons, the Cornavii and Dobuni, the boundary\r\nbetween these territories being, it would seem, the river Avon. Near\r\nthe Avon, relics of frontier fortresses on either side have—as at\r\nBrownsover, Brailes, Burton Dassett, Brinklow, &c.,—been found; the\r\nprincipal British and Roman roads being the Icknield Street, the\r\nFosse Way, and Watling Street. Warwick is believed, and not without\r\nreason, to have been one of these frontier fortresses; its situation\r\nwould seem to lend strength to the supposition. In Anglo-Saxon\r\ntimes, Warwick formed a part of the kingdom of Mercia, the capital\r\nof which was at Repton, in the neighbouring county of Derby. At that\r\nperiod it “fell under the dominion of Warremund, who rebuilt it,\r\nand called it Warrewyke, after his own name.” Having been taken and\r\ndestroyed by the Danes, it “so rested,” says Dugdale, “until the\r\nrenowned Lady Ethelfled, daughter to King Alfred—who had the whole\r\nearldom of Mercia given her by her father to the noble Etheldred in\r\nmarriage—repaired its ruins, and in the year of Christ DCCCCXV made a\r\nstrong fortification here, called the dungeon, for resistance of the\r\nenemy, upon a hill of earth, artificially raised near the river side;”\r\nand this formed the nucleus of the present building. In 1016 it is\r\nstated to have again suffered from an attack by the Danes, who nearly\r\ndemolished the fortifications of the castle and did great damage to the\r\ntown. At the time of making the Domesday survey, Warwick was a royal\r\nburgh, and “contained 261 houses, and with its castle was regarded as\r\na place of much consequence; for orders were issued by the Conqueror\r\nto Turchel to repair and fortify the town and castle of Warwick.\r\nThis was carried into effect, by surrounding the town with a strong\r\nwall and ditch, and by enlarging the castle and strengthening its\r\nfortifications.”\r\n\r\nIn 1172 (19th Henry II.), Warwick Castle was provisioned and garrisoned\r\nat an expense of £10 (which would be equivalent to about £200 of our\r\npresent money), on behalf of the king; and during those troublous times\r\nit remained about three years in his hands. In 1173 a sum equal to\r\nabout £500 of our money was paid to the soldiers in the castle; and\r\nin the following year, the building requiring considerable repair,\r\nabout £50 was laid out upon it, and a considerable sum was paid to\r\nthe soldiers who defended it for the king. In 1191 it was again\r\nrepaired, and also in the reign of King John. In the 48th of Henry\r\nIII. (1263), William Mauduit, Earl of Warwick, was surprised by the\r\nadherents of Simon de Montfort, then holding Kenilworth, and the walls\r\nof the castle were completely destroyed; indeed, so complete was the\r\ndevastation, that in 1315 “it was returned in an inquisition as worth\r\nnothing excepting the herbage in the ditches, valued at 6_s._ 8_d._”\r\nIn 1337 (12th Edward III.) a new building was commenced, and in that\r\nyear a royal licence was granted for the founding of a chantry chapel\r\nin the castle. The building was commenced by Thomas Beauchamp, Earl\r\nof Warwick, whose monument is preserved in the Beauchamp Chapel. In\r\n1394 (17th Richard II.) Guy’s Tower is said to have been completed by\r\nThomas Beauchamp, second son of the last named Thomas, at a cost of\r\n£395 5_s._ 2_d._, and by him to have been named “Guy’s Tower.” In the\r\nreign of James I. a sum of about £20,000 was expended by the then owner\r\nof the castle, Fulke Greville, Lord Broke, “in making it habitable and\r\nrestoring it to its former importance.” From this time downwards, the\r\ncastle has undergone many alterations, and so-called “beautifyings,” at\r\nthe hands of its different owners; but, despite all, it retained its\r\nancient grandeur and its most interesting features, and was, as Sir\r\nWalter Scott has said, “the fairest monument of ancient and chivalrous\r\nsplendour which remains uninjured by time.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Castle, from the Temple Field._]\r\n\r\nAnd now as to its long line of illustrious and valiant owners.\r\n\r\nPassing over the whimsical list of earls, &c., in Rous’s Roll, beginning\r\nwith “King Guthelyne, about the sixth of Kinge Alexander the greate\r\nconqueror,” and “Kinge Gwydered, who began to reigne the 4th yere\r\nfrom the birth of our Lord,” reminding one very forcibly of the\r\n“Promptuaire des Medalles,” which commences the series with those of\r\n“Adam” and of “Heva vx Adam,”—the first we need even hint at, so\r\nobscure is the matter, is Rohan de Arden, who is stated to have married\r\na daughter and heiress of “Æneas, Earl of Warwick, in the time of\r\nthe Saxons,” and to have succeeded to that title and estates. Rohan\r\nde Arden is said to have lived in the reigns of Alfred and Edward\r\nthe Elder, and to have been succeeded by the “renowned Guy,” Earl of\r\nWarwick (the legend connected with him will be noticed on subsequent\r\npages), who had married his only daughter and heiress, Felicia. This\r\nSir Guy “is said to have been son of Syward, Lord of Wallingford, which\r\npossession Guy also enjoyed.” “He was often in conflicts with the Danes\r\nin defence of his country; did many brave exploits; and, lastly, as\r\nthe story goes, after his return from the Holy Land, retired from the\r\nworld, and turn’d hermit, and lived in an adjacent cave, now called\r\n‘Guy’s Cliff,’ wherein he died, and was buried in a chapel there,\r\nanno 929, aged about seventy years, leaving issue, by Felicia his\r\nwife, Reynborne,” who succeeded him, and “married Leonora, or Leoneta,\r\ndaughter to King Athelstan.” From him the descent is said to have been\r\ncontinued in regular succession through father and son (Wegeat or\r\nWeyth, Wygod, Alcuin or Aylwin, &c.) to Turchel, who was earl at the\r\ntime of the Norman Conquest, and who was allowed by that monarch to\r\nretain possession of the estates, but was ultimately deprived of both\r\nthem and of the earldom.\r\n\r\nThe castle having been strengthened and enlarged, its custody was given\r\nto Henry de Newburgh, a Norman, who had accompanied the Conqueror,\r\nand to him was afterwards granted all the possessions of Turchel de\r\nWarwick, and he was made Earl of Warwick. By some he is said to have\r\nmarried the daughter of Turchel, but he is also stated to have married\r\nthree other ladies. He was succeeded by his son, Roger Newburgh, as\r\nsecond Earl of Warwick, who married Gundred, daughter of the second\r\nEarl Warren, by whom he had a son, William, who succeeded him as third\r\nearl, and dying without issue, was succeeded by his brother Walleran\r\nas fourth earl, who married twice—first, Margaret de Bohun, and\r\nsecond, Alice de Harcourt. By his first wife he had two sons, Henry,\r\nwho succeeded him, and Walleran. Henry de Newburgh, fifth Earl of\r\nWarwick, was a minor at his father’s death in 1205, and was placed\r\nunder Thomas Bassett, of Headington, near Oxford. In the thirteenth\r\nyear of King John, he was certified as holding 107 knights’ fees of the\r\nking _in capite_. Having led an active military life, and married two\r\nwives—Margaret D’Oyley and Philippa Bassett—he died 1229, and was\r\nsucceeded as sixth earl by his son, Thomas de Newburgh.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Keep, from the Inner Court._]\r\n\r\nThis nobleman married a daughter of the Earl of Salisbury, but died\r\nwithout issue. His sister and heiress, Margery, who was married to\r\nJohn de Mareschal, brother to the Earl of Pembroke, succeeded to the\r\nestates, and her husband became seventh earl. This honour he did not\r\nenjoy long, but died without issue “within about half a year of his\r\nbrother-in-law the late earl.” The widow then, by special arrangement\r\nof Henry III., married John de Placetis, or Plessitis, a Norman by\r\nbirth, and a great favourite of the king. By the Countess of Warwick\r\nhe had no issue, and therefore at her death the estates passed to her\r\ncousin, William Mauduit, Baron of Hanslape, who died without issue.\r\nThe title and estates then at his death passed to his sister, Isabel\r\nMauduit, wife of William de Beauchamp, heir of Walter de Beauchamp,\r\nBaron of Elmley, who thus through her became heir to the title, which\r\nhowever,—she having entered a nunnery,—was not claimed, but passed,\r\nin the person of their son William, into the powerful family of\r\nBeauchamp. By Isabel Mauduit William de Beauchamp the elder had four\r\nsons—William, who succeeded him; John, whose grandson was created\r\nBaron Beauchamp; Walter, ancestor of Fulke Greville, Lord Broke; and\r\nThomas, who died unmarried. William de Beauchamp, who bore the title\r\nof Earl of Warwick during his father’s lifetime, married Maud, one\r\nof the co-heiresses of Richard Fitzjohn, by whom he had issue with\r\nothers, Guy de Beauchamp, who succeeded him as Earl of Warwick. This\r\nGuy, so called, no doubt, after the “renowned Guy,” attended the\r\nking into Scotland, and for his valour at the battle of Falkirk, had\r\ngranted to him all the lands of Geoffrey de Mowbray in that kingdom,\r\nwith the exception of Okeford, and all the lands of John de Strivelin,\r\nwith the castle of Amesfield, and the lands of Drungery. He was one\r\nof the noblemen who seized Piers Gaveston,—against whom he held a\r\nmortal hatred for having called him “the black hound of Arden,”—whom\r\nhe conveyed to Warwick Castle, from whence he was removed to Blacklow\r\nHill, near Warwick, and beheaded. This Guy married Alice, sister and\r\nheiress to Robert de Toni, Baron of Flamstead, and widow of Thomas de\r\nLeybourne, and by her had issue two sons and five daughters. He died\r\n(it was suspected by poison) in 1315, and was succeeded by his eldest\r\nson, Thomas de Beauchamp, who married Catherine Mortimer, daughter of\r\nthe Earl of March, by whom he had issue seven sons and ten daughters.\r\nThe sons were—Sir Guy, “a stout soldier,” who died in his father’s\r\nlifetime, leaving three daughters, all nuns, at Shouldham; Thomas, his\r\nsuccessor; Reynbourne, so called in memory of the son of the “renowned\r\nGuy;” William, who became Lord Abergavenny; Roger, John, and Jerome.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThomas Beauchamp, the eldest son, who succeeded to the honours, was\r\nknighted in the lifetime of his father. He, like his predecessor, made\r\nmany additions to the castle, the principal of which was the building\r\nof Guy’s Tower. Having passed a troublous life, being at one time\r\nconfined and condemned in the Tower of London, he died in 1401, leaving\r\nby his wife Margaret, daughter of Lord Ferrars of Groby, two daughters,\r\nnuns, and one son, Richard Beauchamp, who succeeded him. This Richard,\r\nEarl of Warwick, is said to “have surpassed even the great valour and\r\nreputation of his ancestors;” and, indeed, his career seems altogether\r\nto have been one of the most brilliant and successful on record; and\r\nbesides having a special herald of his own, “Warwick Herald,” he was\r\nstyled the “Father of Courtesye.” “He founded the Chantry of Guy’s\r\nCliff, where before this foundation were Guy’s Chappel and Cottage.”\r\nIn this he placed the statue of Guy (still seen, though much defaced),\r\nmade several pious donations, and died at Roan in the 17th of Henry VI.\r\nThere is extant a very remarkable and curious MS. Life of this renowned\r\nwarrior; it is preserved in the British Museum (Julius, E. IV.).\r\nIn it the illuminations are very spirited, and are highly valuable\r\nas examples of armour, &c., of the time, no less than as genuine\r\nrepresentations of various valiant deeds in which he was engaged.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThree of these we give. Our first shows the figures of the Earl of\r\nWarwick and Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, from a picture of the fight\r\nwith Philip, Duke of Burgundy, before Calais. The next represents “how\r\na mighty duke challenged Erle Richard (Beauchamp) for his lady sake,\r\nand in justyng slewe the Duke, and then the Empresse toke the Erle’s\r\nstaff and bear from a knight’s shouldre, and for great love and favour\r\nshe sett it on her shouldre. Then Erle Richard made one of perle and\r\nprecious stones, and offered her that, and she gladly and lovynglee\r\nreseaved it.” The engraving shows the Earl vanquishing the Duke—his\r\nlance has run through his body—and the heralds proclaiming his\r\nvictory. Behind are the Emperor Sigismund and his Empress, the latter\r\nof whom is taking, as recounted, the Earl’s badge of the bear and\r\nragged staff from the shoulders of the knight to place upon her own. On\r\nthe Earl’s helmet will be seen his crest of the bear and ragged staff.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn the third engraving we see the Earl of Warwick setting out in his\r\nown ship, on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. He is dressed in pilgrim\r\nguise, and, staff in hand, is just stepping into the boat to be\r\nconveyed to the ship, his attendants and luggage following him. The\r\nship is sumptuously fitted with castle and state apartments, and has\r\nthe sail emblazoned with the Beauchamp arms, and the pennon, besides\r\nthe St. George’s cross of England, bears the bear and ragged staff many\r\ntimes repeated. This badge will be best understood by the accompanying\r\nengraving. The Earl had two wives; first, Elizabeth, daughter and\r\nheiress of Thomas, Lord Berkley; and second, Isabel, daughter of Thomas\r\nle Despencer, Earl of Gloucester. He was succeeded by his son Henry,\r\nwho was then barely fourteen years old.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis Henry de Beauchamp—who had during his father’s lifetime been\r\ncalled De Spencer, through his mother’s possessions—when only nineteen\r\nyears of age tendered his services to Henry VI. for the defence of\r\nAcquitane, for which the king created him Premier Earl of England,\r\nwith leave to distinguish himself and his heirs male by wearing in his\r\npresence a gold coronet.\r\n\r\nThree days later, he was created DUKE of Warwick, with precedence\r\nnext to the Duke of Norfolk. After this, he had granted to him, in\r\nreversion, the Islands of Guernsey, Jersey, Sark, Erme, and Alderney,\r\nwhich he was to hold for the yearly tribute of a rose. He was also by\r\nhis sovereign crowned King of the Isle of Wight, his Majesty himself\r\nplacing the crown upon his head. This young nobleman, however, with all\r\nhis honours thick upon him, lived but a short life of greatness, and\r\ndied at Warwick at the early age of twenty-two, in 1445. He married\r\nCicely, daughter of Richard Nevil, Earl of Salisbury, by whom he had an\r\nonly child, Anne, Countess of Warwick, who died when only six years of\r\nage, leaving her aunt Anne, wife of Richard Nevil, Earl of Salisbury,\r\nheir to the titles and estates, and thus they passed to the family of\r\nNevil.\r\n\r\nThis Richard Nevil, then Earl of Warwick, is the one so well\r\nknown in English history as “the stout Earl of Warwick, the\r\nking-maker,”—“peremptory Warwick,” the “wind-changing Warwick,” of\r\nShakspere—who, “finding himself strong enough to hold the balance\r\nbetween the families of York and Lancaster, rendered England during\r\nthe reign of his power a scene of bloodshed and confusion; and made\r\nor unmade kings of this or that house as best suited his passions,\r\npleasures, or interests. His life was passed in wars and broils,\r\ndestructive to his country and his family.” He was killed at the battle\r\nof Barnet in 1471. He left issue two daughters, Isabel, married to\r\nGeorge, Duke of Clarence and brother to Edward IV.; and Anne, married\r\nfirst to Edward, Prince of Wales, and secondly, to his murderer,\r\nRichard, Duke of Gloucester, subsequently King Richard III. To the\r\neldest of these daughters, Isabel, came the Warwick estates; and her\r\nhusband, George Plantagenet, Duke of Clarence, was, by his brother\r\nEdward IV., created Earl of Warwick and Salisbury. That ill-fated and\r\nindiscreet nobleman, however, did not live to carry out improvements he\r\nhad commenced at Warwick. His wife was poisoned; and he himself, later\r\non, was attainted of high treason, and was drowned in a butt of Malmsey\r\nwine in the Tower, by order of his brother, the Duke of Gloucester.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cæsar’s Tower._]\r\n\r\nDuring all this time, Anne, Countess of Warwick, widow of Richard\r\nNevil, had undergone great privations—her possessions being taken from\r\nher for her daughters’ husbands—and had been living in obscurity;\r\nby Act 3rd Henry VII. she was recalled from such obscurity to be\r\nrestored to the possessions of her family; “but that was a refinement\r\nof cruelty, for shortly after obtaining possession she was forced” to\r\nsurrender to the king all these immense possessions. After her death,\r\nEdward Plantagenet, eldest son of George, Duke of Clarence, assumed\r\nthe title of Earl of Warwick, but was beheaded on Tower Hill. On his\r\ndeath the title was held in abeyance, and was, after a time, granted\r\nto John Dudley, Viscount Lisle, who was descended in the female line\r\nfrom the old Earls of Warwick. This John Dudley, Earl of Warwick, and\r\nViscount Lisle, was made Lord High Chamberlain, a Knight of the Garter,\r\nLord Warden of the North, and Earl Marshal: and was created Duke of\r\nNorthumberland, but was attainted for the part he took relating to\r\nLady Jane Grey, and beheaded on Tower Hill in 1553. He married Jane,\r\ndaughter of Sir Edward Guildford, by whom he had a large family, of\r\nwhom the eldest, Henry, was killed at the siege of Boulogne; the\r\nsecond, John, was called Earl of Warwick during his father’s lifetime;\r\nAmbrose, who was created Earl of Warwick; Guildford, who was beheaded\r\nwith his father; Robert, who was created Earl of Leicester, and\r\nothers. In 1557 Ambrose Dudley, the third son, having obtained a\r\nreversion of the attainder, had the estates restored to him, and was\r\nre-created Earl of Warwick. He married three wives, but had no issue by\r\neither, and dying in 1589, the title became extinct.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Castle, from the Bridge._]\r\n\r\nIn 1618 the title of Earl of Warwick was conferred by James I. on\r\nRobert, Lord Rich, but, not being descended from the former earls, the\r\nestates did not fall into his hands. Dying in a few months after his\r\ncreation, he was succeeded by his son, Robert Rich, Lord High Admiral\r\nfor the Long Parliament, whose son (afterwards Earl of Warwick) married\r\nFrances, the youngest daughter of Oliver Cromwell. After passing\r\nthrough five other members of this family, the title again became\r\nextinct, on the death of the last earl of that name, Edward Rich, in\r\n1759.\r\n\r\nIn November of that year (1759) the title was conferred upon Francis\r\nGreville, Lord Brooke, of the long and illustrious line of the\r\nGrevilles, and a descendant of Fulke Greville, the “servaunt to Quene\r\nElizabeth, Concellor to King James, and Frend to Sir Philip Sidney,”\r\nto whom we have alluded in our account of Penshurst. Francis, Lord\r\nBrooke, succeeded his father in the barony, when only eight years of\r\nage. In 1746 he was raised to the dignity of Earl Brooke, of Warwick\r\nCastle; and in 1759 was created Earl of Warwick, with patent to bear\r\nthe ancient crest of the earls—the bear and ragged staff. He married\r\na daughter of Lord Archibald Hamilton, by whom, besides others, he had\r\na son, George Greville, who succeeded him as second earl of that line.\r\nHis lordship married, first, Georgiana, only daughter of Lord Selsey,\r\nwho died soon after the birth of her only child, a year after marriage;\r\nthe child, a son, living to the age of fourteen. He married, secondly,\r\nHenrietta, daughter of R. Vernon, Esq., and his wife, the Countess of\r\nOssory, and sister of the Marquis of Stafford. By that lady he had\r\nthree sons and six daughters. Dying in 1816, he was succeeded by his\r\neldest son, Henry Richard Greville, as Earl Brooke, Earl of Warwick,\r\n&c., who, in 1816, married Lady Sarah Elizabeth Saville, daughter of\r\nthe Earl of Mexborough, and widow of Lord Monson: she died in 1851. By\r\nthis lady his lordship (who died in 1853) had an only son, the present\r\npeer.\r\n\r\nGeorge Guy Greville, Earl Brooke, Earl of Warwick, and Baron Brooke of\r\nBeauchamp’s Court, all in the peerage of the United Kingdom, was born\r\nin March, 1818, and was educated at St. John’s College, Cambridge,\r\nwhere he took his degrees. In 1853 he succeeded his father as fourth\r\nEarl of Warwick, of that line, and in the previous year (1852) married\r\nthe Lady Ann Charteris, eldest daughter of the Earl of Wemyss, by\r\nwhom he has issue living, four sons and one daughter, viz.:—the\r\nHon. Francis Richard Charles Guy Greville (Lord Brooke), born in\r\n1853, his heir-presumptive; the Hon. Alwyn Henry Fulke Greville,\r\nborn in 1854; the Hon. Louis George Greville, born in 1856; the Hon.\r\nSidney Robert Greville, born in 1866; and the Hon. Eva Sarah Louisa\r\nGreville, born in 1860. His lordship, who sat in Parliament for South\r\nWarwickshire from 1846 to the time of succeeding to the title in 1853,\r\nis Lieutenant-Colonel of the Warwickshire Yeomanry, a Trustee of Rugby\r\nSchool, and is patron of five livings.\r\n\r\nThe arms of the present peer are—_sable_, on a cross within a\r\nbordure, all engrailed, _or_, five pellets. Crests—first, out of a\r\nducal coronet, _gules_, a demi-swan with wings expanded and elevated,\r\n_argent_, for Brooke; second, a bear sejant, supporting a ragged\r\nstaff, _argent_, muzzled, _gules_, for Beauchamp, &c. Supporters—two\r\nswans, wings inverted, _argent_, ducally gorged, _gules_. Motto, “Vix\r\nea nostra voco.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Castle, from the Island._]\r\n\r\nHaving thus glanced at the history of the place, and spoken of the\r\nlong line of noble and illustrious owners, both of the estates and the\r\ntitle, let us turn to the castle itself, as it stood and was furnished,\r\nat the time of our visit. Alas! that we should have to write this in\r\na past sense, and say “stood” in place of “stands.” Alas! that within\r\na few short weeks of our visit, and of our writing these notes, a\r\ngreat part of the building was “gutted” by fire, and many of its\r\nmost important and interesting features destroyed. It is, however,\r\nbeing rapidly and wisely restored, and doubtless will, ere long, rise\r\n“phœnix-like” from the ashes, with renewed beauty. We give our notes as\r\nwe wrote them before this calamity occurred.\r\n\r\nTHE Castle occupies the summit of a steep hill, which must greatly have\r\naided its artificial defences in the “olden time.” The present approach\r\nto it is by a narrow passage cut through the solid rock, and extending\r\nfrom the main entrance to the porter’s lodge fronting the road to\r\nLeamington. Passing through this lodge, the visitor, after proceeding\r\nsome distance along the rocky passages, enters the outer court-yard,\r\n“where the stupendous line of fortifications breaks suddenly upon the\r\nsight in all its bold magnificence.” Of the two famous towers that\r\nof Guy is on the right, while that of Cæsar is on the left; they are\r\nconnected by a strong embattled wall, in the centre of which is the\r\nponderous arched gateway, flanked by towers, and succeeded by a second\r\narched gateway, with towers and battlements, “formerly defended by two\r\nportholes, one of which still remains; before the whole is a disused\r\nmoat, with an arch thrown over it at the gateway, where was once a\r\ndrawbridge.” Passing the double gateway the court-yard is entered. Thus\r\nseen, the castellated mansion of the most famous of the feudal barons\r\nhas a tranquil and peaceful aspect; fronting it is a green sward and\r\nthe “frowning keep,” which conceals all its gloomier features behind a\r\nscreen of ivy and evergreen shrubs. Uninjured by time, and unaltered in\r\nappearance by modern improvements, except in being surrounded and made\r\npicturesque by trees and shrubs, it still stands, as of old, on the top\r\nof its mound. The “Bear Tower,” with a flight of steps descending to a\r\nsubterranean passage, leading no one knows whither, will be noticed, as\r\nalso will “Guy’s Tower.”\r\n\r\nFrom the inner court a flight of stone steps leads to the entrance to\r\nthe GREAT HALL, which is of large size; its walls are decorated with\r\narms and armour of various periods and descriptions, and with antlers\r\nand other appropriate objects. On one side of this hall are the state\r\nrooms, and on the other the domestic apartments, forming a line of\r\n333 feet in length. The Hall, and indeed the whole of the interior,\r\nhave been “subjected to the deleterious influence of the upholsterer,”\r\nand are made gorgeous and beautiful in accordance with modern\r\ntaste, while they have lost their original features and interesting\r\ncharacteristics. This work was, however, done some time ago, and\r\nit must remain as it is: comfort and convenience have been studied\r\ncertainly; but all associations with the glory of ancient Warwick were\r\nrejected by the modern architect in his restoration of the apartments\r\nof the venerable castle. In the hall, however, there are many objects\r\nof rare interest; among others the helmet studded with brass worn\r\nby the Protector Cromwell; the suit of armour worn by Montrose; the\r\ndoublet, “blood-spotted,” in which Lord Broke was slain at Lichfield,\r\nin 1643; and the warder’s horn, the history of which is told in this\r\ninscription:—\r\n\r\n PHIL · THOMASSINUS · FEC · ET · EXCUD · CUM · PRIVIL · SUMMI ·\r\n PONTIFICES · ET · SUPERIOR : LICENTIA · ROMÆ · FLORUIT · 1598.\r\n\r\nThere is also a breech-loading revolving musket, some hundreds of years\r\nold probably, which, but for the evidence of Time, might seem a direct\r\nplagiarism on the revolver of Colonel Colt. The roof of the hall was\r\ndesigned by the architect Poynter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe RED DRAWING-ROOM contains many fine paintings and several articles\r\nof _vertu_.\r\n\r\nThe CEDAR DRAWING-ROOM is a remarkably elegant apartment, sumptuously\r\nfurnished, and having a magnificent and, said to be, unique chimney\r\npiece. In this room are many remarkably fine paintings, including\r\n“Charles I.,” by Vandyck; “Circe,” by Guido; the “Family of Charles\r\nI.,” &c.; and some highly interesting bronzes, Etruscan vases, &c. The\r\nmain feature of—\r\n\r\nThe GILT DRAWING-ROOM is its superb geometric ceiling, which is richly\r\npainted and gilt—the walls being decorated in a corresponding manner.\r\nAmong the paintings in this room may be noted the “Earl of Strafford,”\r\nby Vandyck; “Algernon Percy,” by Dodson; “Charles I.,” “Henrietta\r\nMaria,” and “Prince Rupert,” by Vandyck; “Ignatius Loyola,” by Rubens;\r\n“Robert Bertie, Earl of Lindsay,” by Cornelius Jansen; “Robert Rich,\r\nEarl of Warwick,” after Vandyck; a “Young Girl,” by Murillo; “Robert\r\nDudley, Earl of Leicester,” and many others.\r\n\r\nThe STATE BED-ROOM. The bed and furniture in this room are said\r\noriginally to have belonged to Queen Anne, and were presented to the\r\nWarwick family by King George III. The walls are hung with Brussels\r\ntapestry of the date of 1604. The bed and hangings are of crimson\r\nvelvet. Over the chimney-piece is a fine full-length portrait of Queen\r\nAnne by Sir Godfrey Kneller; the room also contains other interesting\r\npaintings and ornaments.\r\n\r\nThe BOUDOIR is a lovely little room, forming the extreme west end of\r\nthe suite of rooms. The ceiling is enriched with the family crest\r\nand coronets, and there are among the paintings a portrait of Henry\r\nVIII. by Holbein;[33] of the Duchess of Cleveland, Barbara Villiers,\r\nby Lely; “A Dead Christ,” by Carracci; “A Boar Hunt,” by Rubens;\r\n“Martin Luther,” by Holbein; “A Sketch of the Evangelists,” by Rubens;\r\nand examples of Gerard Dow, Teniers, Salvator Rosa, Hayter, Vandyck,\r\nHolbein (Anne Boleyn and Mary Boleyn being especially interesting),\r\nAndrea del Sarto, &c., &c.\r\n\r\nThe COMPASS-ROOM contains many fine old paintings and much among its\r\narticles of _vertu_ that will interest the visitor. In—\r\n\r\nThe CHAPEL PASSAGE, too, are highly interesting paintings; and in the\r\nCHAPEL are some stained glass and interesting local relics.\r\n\r\nThe GREAT DINING-ROOM, built by Francis, Earl of Warwick, is a noble\r\nroom, decorated with some fine antique busts and paintings. Among the\r\nlatter will be specially noticed portraits of “Sir Philip Sidney,”\r\nconsidered the best in existence, and bearing in the corner the\r\nwords, “The Original of Sir Philip Sidney;” “Robert Dudley, Earl of\r\nLeicester;” “Frederick, Prince of Wales;” “The Princess of Wales and\r\nGeorge III. when an Infant;” and many family portraits. At the east\r\nend is the celebrated “Kenilworth Buffet,” manufactured by Cookes of\r\nWarwick, from an oak-tree on the Kenilworth estate, and representing\r\nin its panels various incidents connected with Queen Elizabeth’s visit\r\nto that venerable pile, and presented to the present earl, on his\r\nmarriage, by the town and county of Warwick.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Castle, from the Outer Court._]\r\n\r\nThe private apartments of the Castle consist of a remarkably elegant\r\nsuite of rooms, which are, of course, not shown to visitors. Of these,\r\ntherefore, only a few words need be said. The ARMOURY PASSAGE and the\r\nARMOURY contain a rare assemblage of arms and armour of various ages\r\nand descriptions, and many antiquities and “curiosities,” as well as\r\nmineralogical, geological, and other collections of great interest. In\r\nthe BILLIARD-ROOM, the OAK SITTING-ROOM, the EARL’S ROOM, and all the\r\nremaining apartments, are many remarkably fine paintings.\r\n\r\nThroughout the state apartments, as well as the private rooms, is\r\ndistributed a marvellous collection of treasures of art—“superb\r\ngarde-robes, encoigneurs, cabinets, and tables of buhl and marqueterie\r\nof the most costly finish; splendid cups, flasks, and vases in ormolu,\r\ncrystal, china, and lava; Etruscan vases, marble and _pietra dura_\r\ntables; bronzes and busts displaying the utmost efforts of art; costly\r\nbijouteries, and rare antiques;” more especially a large collection of\r\nLimousin enamels are among the treasures which meet the eye at every\r\nturn in the interior of Warwick Castle.\r\n\r\nIt will be readily understood that the prospect from any of the windows\r\nis singularly beautiful; so beautiful, indeed, that if the stately\r\ncastle lacked all other interest, a look over these grand woods, a fair\r\nstream consecrated by the bard of Avon, richly cultivated gardens, and\r\nrare trees of prodigious size, would amply compensate the visitor.\r\n\r\nIn the grounds are many charming objects and delicious spots,\r\nconcerning some of which the visitor, naturally, will desire\r\ninformation. Of these, CÆSAR’S TOWER is one of the most sadly\r\ninteresting, from the fact that beneath it is a dark and damp dungeon,\r\nin which many a sad heart has died out in solitude. On the walls are\r\nsome touching inscriptions and rude carvings done by the miserable\r\nbeings who have been incarcerated there. Among these the following is\r\nspecially curious:—\r\n\r\n  Ma_ʃ_TER : IOHN : SMyTH : GVNER : TO : HIS :\r\n  MAIESTyE : HIghNES : WAS : A PRISNER IN THIS\r\n  PlACE : AND : lAy HERE frOM 1642 TEll th\r\n  WillIAM SIDIaTE ROT This SAME\r\n  ANd if My PIN HAd Bin BETER fOR\r\n  HIs sake I WOVlD HAVE MENdEd\r\n  EVERRi leTTER.\r\n\r\nThat was the last person known to have been confined in the dungeon.\r\nBesides this, there are crosses, crucifixes, cross-bows, and other\r\nobjects and inscriptions traceable on the walls.\r\n\r\nGUY’S TOWER (to which we have alluded, and which forms our initial\r\nletter on page 206) contains several rooms appropriated to various\r\npurposes. Its summit is reached by a flight of 133 steps—a most\r\nfatiguing ascent, but amply repaid by the magnificent panoramic\r\nview obtained from the battlements. Hence “are seen the spires of\r\nthe Coventry churches, the Castle of Kenilworth, Guy’s Cliff, and\r\nBlacklow Hill; Grove Park, the seat of Lord Dormer; Shuckburgh and\r\nthe Shropshire Hills; the Saxon Tower on the Broadway Hills; the\r\nfashionable spa of Leamington, which appears almost lying underneath\r\nthe feet, and the wide-extended park; while village churches, lifting\r\nup their venerable heads from amidst embowering trees, fill up a\r\npicture pleasing, grand, and interesting. In the various rooms will\r\nbe noticed carvings and inscriptions which possess interest. From\r\nthe BEAR COURT a portcullised doorway in the north wall opens to the\r\nmoat, across which is a bridge leading to the pleasure-grounds and\r\nCONSERVATORY. In this is placed one of the wonders of the “Stately\r\nHome”—the celebrated _Warwick Vase_, rescued from the bottom of a lake\r\nat Adrian’s Villa, near Tivoli, by Sir William Hamilton, from whom it\r\nwas obtained by the late Earl of Warwick.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Inner Court, from the Keep._]\r\n\r\nIt has been copied a hundred times, and its form and character\r\nare known to every reader. It stands on a pedestal formed for its\r\nreception, on which is this inscription:—\r\n\r\n  HOC PRISTINÆ ARTIS\r\n  ROMANÆ Q. MAGNIFICENTIÆ MONUMENTUM\r\n  RUDERIBUS VILLÆ TIBURTINÆ\r\n  HADRIANO AUG. IN DELICIIS HABITÆ EFFOSSUM\r\n  RESTITUTI CURAVIT\r\n  EQUES GULIELMUS HAMILTON\r\n  A GEORGIO III., MAG. BRIT.

DCCLXXIV.\r\n\r\nFrom the conservatory, after crossing the lawn, the banks of the river\r\nare gained, and after passing the PAVILION, the visitor reaches a spot\r\nfrom which the immense height of the castle on its rocky base is best\r\nseen. Returning to the HILL TOWER, the magnificent cedars of Lebanon\r\nand chestnuts will strike the eye; but the visitor will pass on to the\r\ntop of the mount on which, in Saxon times, the stronghold of Ethelfleda\r\nwas erected, and he will then find much for his mind to dwell upon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Guy’s and the Clock Tower, from the Keep._]\r\n\r\nIn the PORTER’S LODGE are preserved a number of relics, said to have\r\nbelonged to the “Renowned Guy”—but, as they represent so many periods,\r\nthey must have appertained to “Many Guys.” The articles shown are\r\n“Guy’s Porridge-pot;” “Guy’s Sword,” for taking care of which William\r\nHoggeson, Yeoman of the Buttery, had a salary of 2_d._ a day, temp. H.\r\nVIII.; parts of his armour, of which the “bascinet is of the time of\r\nEdward III.; and a breastplate partly of the fifteenth century, and\r\npartly of the time of James I.; the sword of the reign of Henry VIII.;\r\nthe staff, an ancient tilting lance;” the horse armour of the fifteenth\r\ncentury; the “flesh fork;” and other articles, among which are his\r\nfair “Felicia’s slippers,” which are a pair of footed stirrup-irons of\r\nthe fifteenth century. The “rib of the dun cow,” and a joint of the\r\nspine of the same, as well as the tusk and blade bone of a wild boar,\r\nare also shown, and are still looked upon with wonder, as belonging\r\nto veritable animals slain by Guy. There are also other “curiosities”\r\nshown in this lodge, and visitors eagerly inspect them, often as\r\ngreater attractions than matters more worthy. Into the wild old legend\r\nconnected with Guy, Earl of Warwick, it is not necessary here to\r\nenter at length. It was a popular legend in the Middle Ages, and his\r\nencounter with the Danish champion, Colbrand, as well as his victory\r\nover the dun cow, was a favourite subject of the wandering minstrel.\r\nDugdale has given the narrative of his battle with Colbrand, which he\r\nseems inclined to believe to be true in the main features, although\r\n“the monks may have sounded out his praises hyperbolically.” According\r\nto him, “in year three of King Athelstan, A.D. 826, the Danes having\r\ninvaded England, cruelly wasted the countrys where they marcht, so that\r\nthere was scarce a town or castle that they had not burnt or destroyed\r\nalmost as far as Winchester,” where the king resided, and to whom they\r\nsent a message, requiring him to resign his crown to their generals,\r\nholding his power at their hands, and paying them yearly tribute for\r\nthe privilege of ruling; or that the whole dispute for the kingdom be\r\ndetermined in a single combat, by two champions for both sides. The\r\nking having chosen the latter alternative, enjoins a fast for three\r\ndays, and, in great anguish of heart that Guy the famous warrior is\r\nabsent on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, prays Heaven for assistance.\r\nAn angel appears to the king as he is on his bed, and directs him to\r\narise early on the morrow, and take two bishops with him to the north\r\ngate of the city, and stay there “till the hour of prime,” until the\r\npoor people and pilgrims arrive, among whom he must choose a champion,\r\nand the choice must fall upon him who goes barefooted, with a wreath of\r\nwhite roses on his head. The king goes and meets the pilgrim, accosts\r\nhim, and asks his championship, which he hesitates to give, excusing\r\nhimself on the ground of his weakness with much travel, and exhorts\r\nhim to seek fitter help. To this the king bitterly answers, “I had but\r\none valiant knight, which was Earl of Warwick, called Guy, and he had\r\na courageous servant, named Sir Heraud de Ardene; would to God I had\r\nhim here, for then should this duel be soon undertaken, and the war\r\nfinished; and as he spake these words, the tears fell from his eyes.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Castle, from the banks of the Avon._]\r\n\r\nThe pilgrim is moved, and ultimately consents, and after three weeks\r\nspent in prayer and preparation the battle begins. Colbrand “came so\r\nweightily harnessed, that his horse could scarcely carry him, and\r\nbefore him a cart loaded with Danish axes, great clubs, with knobs\r\nof iron, squared bars of steel, lances, and iron hooks, to pull his\r\nadversary to him.” The giant uses a bar of steel in the combat, which\r\nlasts the whole day. Guy in the end proving victorious, and taking\r\na farewell of the king, to whom he declares himself, goes towards\r\nWarwick, and thence to a hermit in its neighbourhood, living with\r\nhim till his death, and succeeding him in his cell until his own\r\ndecease.[34] The spot is still pointed out, and bears the name of\r\nGuy’s Cliff. But this is not the only giant-story connected with the\r\nfamily. Their well-known crest, or cognisance, is said to come from one\r\nMorvidus, an Earl of Warwick in the days of King Arthur, “who being\r\na man of valour, slew a mighty gyant in a single duell, which gyant\r\nencountered him with a young tree pulled up by the root, the boughs\r\nbeing nog’d from it; in token whereof, he and his successors, Earles\r\nof Warwick in the time of the Brittons, bore a ragged staff of silver\r\nin a sable shield for their cognisance.” Other stories are the combat\r\nand overcoming of the famous dun cow, the slaying of a ferocious lion,\r\nand “the greatest boar that man e’er saw,” the killing of “the mighty\r\ndragon in Northumberland that destroyed men, women, and children,” and\r\nthe killing of the fifteen armed knights. Such were the old fables with\r\nwhich our ancient family histories were obscured, or rendered romantic\r\nand wonderful to the subordinate classes.\r\n\r\nIntimately connected with Warwick Castle and its former lords, is the\r\nBeauchamp Chapel attached to St. Mary’s Church. The chapel is one of\r\nthe most exquisitely beautiful buildings remaining in this country, and\r\nought to be seen by every visitor to Warwick. It is placed on the south\r\nside of the choir of the church, from which it is entered by a descent\r\nof several steps beneath a doorway said to have been carved by a mason\r\nof Warwick in 1704, but probably being only a freshening and touching\r\nup, or restoration, of the original design. The size of the chapel is\r\n58 feet in length, 25 in breadth, and 32 in height, and its design and\r\nfinish are of the most chaste and beautiful and elaborate character.\r\nIt was built in the reign of Henry VI., in accordance with the will of\r\nits founder, Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, who died in 1439. The\r\nfoundation was laid in 1443, and in 1475 the chapel was consecrated,\r\nand the body of its founder with much solemnity laid therein. It is\r\nstated to have cost £2,481 4_s._ 7_d._, an enormous sum in those days,\r\nwhen the value of a fat ox was only 13_s._ 4_d._: and the contracts for\r\nsome of the work are still preserved. In the chapel is the monument\r\nof the founder, which is, with only one exception, the most splendid\r\nmonument of its kind in the kingdom. It is an altar-tomb of Purbeck\r\nmarble, bearing the recumbent effigy of the great earl, in fine latten\r\nbrass, gilt. His head, uncovered, rests upon a helmet, and at his feet\r\nare a bear and a griffin. The tomb is surmounted by one of the few\r\n“hearses” that yet remain in our churches. It consists of six hoops\r\nof brass, extended by five transverse brass rods, on which formerly\r\nwas hung a pall, “to keep the figure reverently from the dust.” Around\r\nthe tomb, in niches, are fourteen figures in “divers vestures, called\r\nweepers,” friends and relatives of the deceased who mourn his loss.\r\nBetween the weepers are smaller niches, raised upon pillars, containing\r\nwhole-length figures of angels holding scrolls, inscribed “Sit deo\r\nlaus in gloria, defunctis misericordia.” The effigy of the earl is the\r\nfinest of its class, and it is a perfect figure, the armour on the\r\nback, and all the details being as highly and carefully finished as\r\nthose on the front of the figure. For this effigy in brass, William\r\nAusten was paid (exclusive of cost of workmen, carriage, &c.) £40, and\r\nthe goldsmith, Bartholomew Lambespring, was paid £13 for gilding it;\r\nthe “weepers” cost in brass, 13_s._ 4_d._ each, and the angels 5_s._\r\neach; and the gilding of these, and preparing them for gilding, cost\r\nalso a considerable sum—the contracts being of the highest interest,\r\nand very minute in every particular.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Beauchamp Chapel, monument of the founder._]\r\n\r\nIn the same chapel are monuments, &c., to Robert Dudley, Earl of\r\nLeicester, and his Countess Lettice, 1588; to Ambrose Dudley, Earl of\r\nWarwick, 1589; to Robert Dudley, Lord Denbigh, 1584; to Lady Katherine\r\nLeveson, and others.\r\n\r\nThe windows were filled with stained glass, for which the contract with\r\nJohn Prudde of Westminster is preserved; but it has undergone much\r\nchange and mutilation: it still, however, especially that of the east\r\nwindow, is of great beauty.[35] Adjoining the chapel is an exquisite\r\nlittle oratory, with a confessional near; of these we give engravings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Confessional._]\r\n\r\nThe Church of St. Mary is of considerable antiquity, and is mentioned\r\nin Domesday Book. The Norman Earl, Henry de Newburgh, formed the\r\nintention of uniting the endowments of St. Nicholas within the Castle\r\nwith St. Mary’s, which was carried out by his son, whose grant of\r\nincorporation was executed in 1123. Probably the church was built about\r\nthat time, as the crypt is of Norman character. In the reign of Edward\r\nIII., Thomas Beauchamp ordained by his will in 1369, that a choir\r\nshould be erected; and many alterations have at one time or other been\r\nmade. A great part of the church was burnt down in 1694, and rebuilt at\r\na cost of £5,000, to which Queen Anne contributed £1,000. In the crypt\r\nis preserved the ducking stool.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Oratory._]\r\n\r\nIt is desirable to add a word or two concerning “Guy’s Cave” and the\r\n“Statue of Guy” at Guy’s Cliff, to which the visitor ought by all\r\nmeans to “wend his way.” Indeed, the town of Warwick, and the whole of\r\nthe neighbourhood by which it is surrounded, is one grand assemblage\r\nof interesting objects, of which the mind cannot tire or become\r\nsatiated. To all we have described—the towers, the lodges, the several\r\napartments of the castle, and to the gardens and grounds—the publicly\r\nis freely, graciously, and generously admitted: a boon for which we are\r\nsure every visitor will be grateful.\r\n\r\nOne of the few remaining “antiques” that yet endure to the town we\r\nhave selected for engraving—the EAST GATE; but, as will be seen, the\r\nbase only can be considered ancient; it has been “transmogrified,” yet\r\nis still striking and interesting. The Earl of Leicester’s Hospital,\r\nfounded by Robert Dudley in 1586, is a singularly beautiful and perfect\r\nspecimen of the half-timber houses; it escaped the great fire that\r\nnearly destroyed the town in 1694. There are not many other ancient\r\nedifices in the venerable town.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Warwick: the East Gate._]\r\n\r\nThus, it will be readily understood that a day at Warwick supplies a\r\nrare treat; not only to the antiquary, and the historian, but to the\r\nlover of nature. The best views of the Castle are obtained from the\r\nopposite side of the Avon, near a narrow stream crossed by a bridge,\r\nwhich is part of the main road;[36] of the old bridge there are some\r\nremains, rendered highly picturesque by ivy and lichens that grow in\r\nprofusion there, and near the old mill, the date of which is coeval\r\nwith that of the Castle. Superb trees grow in the immediate grounds,\r\nhuge chestnuts and gigantic cedars, that have sheltered the stout earls\r\ntime out of mind: the walls are grey with age; but it is a sober livery\r\nthat well suits the stronghold of the bold barons, and suggests the\r\ntranquillity of repose after the fever of battles, sieges, and deeds\r\nthat cannot fail to be summoned from history as one looks from the\r\nfilled-up moat to the towers and battlements that still smile or frown\r\nupon the environing town they controlled or protected.\r\n\r\nIt demands but little imagination to carry the visitor of to-day back\r\nthrough long-past centuries, from the moment we enter the picturesque\r\nyet gloomy passage cut through the rock, covered with ivy, lichens,\r\nand wild flowers in rich abundance, and pass under the portcullis that\r\nyet frowns above the porter’s lodge: the whole seems so little changed\r\nby time, that one might wait for the king-maker and his mighty host to\r\nissue through the gateway, and watch the red rose or the white rose\r\non the helmets of attendant knights; by no great stretch of fancy one\r\nmight see the trembling Gaveston, the petted minion of a weak monarch,\r\ndragged forth to death: a hundred events or incidents are associated\r\nwith these courts and towers, inseparably linked with British history;\r\nand it is impossible to resist a feeling of reverence approaching awe\r\nwhile pacing peacefully among them.\r\n\r\nThe “frowning keep,” nearly hidden by the green foliage of surrounding\r\ntrees, may be accepted as an emblem of the Castle; where tranquillity\r\nand peace are in the stead of fierceness and broil. Warwick, while it\r\nhas lost little of its grandeur, has obtained much of grace from time;\r\nTime which\r\n\r\n  “Moulders into beauty many a tower,\r\n  That when it frowned with all its battlements\r\n  Was only terrible.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHADDON HALL.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Dorothy Vernon’s Door._]\r\n\r\nHADDON HALL is, perhaps, the most interesting, and is certainly\r\nthe most attractive, of all the ancient mansions of England: and\r\nnone have been so fertile of material to Artists. Situate in one\r\nof the most picturesque, if not the most beautiful, of our English\r\nshires, absolutely perfect as an example of the Baronial Halls of our\r\nancestors, and easily accessible by charming routes from populous\r\ntowns, it is not surprising that it should be visited annually by tens\r\nof thousands; and that in America it is regarded as one of the places\r\nin the “Old Country,” which no visitors, even of a week, to the classic\r\nland of their History, should neglect to see, examine, and describe.\r\n\r\nHADDON HALL is distant fourteen miles from BUXTON; perhaps the most\r\nfashionable, as it certainly is one of the most cheerful, and, we\r\nbelieve, the most healthful of all the Baths of England. Its waters are\r\nas efficacious, in certain ailments, as are those of Southern Germany;\r\nwhile the surrounding district is so grand and beautiful, so happily\r\nmingling the sublime and the graceful, as to compete, and by no means\r\nunfavourably, with the hills and valleys that border the distant Rhine.\r\n\r\nThe poet, the novelist, the traveller, the naturalist, the sportsman,\r\nand the antiquary have found appropriate themes in Derbyshire, in\r\nits massive rocks—“Tors”—and deep dells; its pasture-lands on\r\nmountain-slopes; its rapid, yet never broad, rivers—delights of the\r\nangler; its crags and caves; its rugged and ragged or wooded steeps;\r\nabove all, its relics of the earlier days when Briton, Roman, Saxon,\r\nand Norman, held alternate sway over the rich lands and prolific mines\r\nof this lavishly endowed county; and of a later time, when shrewd monks\r\nplanted themselves beside the clear streams and rich meadows, to which\r\nthey bequeathed magnificent ruins to tell of intellectual and material\r\npower in the time of their vigorous and prosperous strength.\r\n\r\nUnequivocal evidence exists that the Romans knew the curative\r\nproperties of the Baths at Buxton; and it is almost certain, from the\r\nmany Celtic barrows and stone circles found in the neighbourhood, that\r\na still earlier race was acquainted with them. Probably, therefore,\r\nfor more than a thousand years Buxton has been one of the principal\r\n“health-resorts” of this island. Yet few remains of antiquity exist\r\nin the town. The dwelling—in which was lodged Mary, Queen of Scots,\r\non her several visits, while in custody of the Earl of Shrewsbury,\r\nand to which “good Queen Bess,” while sojourning at Kenilworth, sent\r\nthe Earl of Leicester, that he might drink of the healing waters,\r\n“twenty days together”—was removed just a century ago: a handsome and\r\nvery commodious hotel occupies the site: it is still called the “Old\r\nHall;” and immediately behind it are the two springs—the Saline and\r\nthe Iron—the Chalybeate and the Tonic. On a window-pane of one of the\r\nrooms in this Old Hall, Mary, Queen of Scots, is said to have scratched\r\nthe following touching and kindly farewell—the pane of glass having\r\nbeen preserved until recent years:—\r\n\r\n  “Buxtona, quæ calidæ celebrare nomine lymphæ,\r\n  Forte mihi posthac non adeunda vale!”\r\n\r\nCheerfulness is the handmaid of health: and, although there are many\r\npatients in and about Buxton, they do not seem to suffer much: there\r\nare more smiles than moans in the pump-room; and rheumatism is not a\r\ndisease that makes much outer show of anguish.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to find in any part of the British dominions a\r\ndrive so grandly beautiful as that between Buxton and Haddon. Within\r\nhalf a mile of its centre is “the Duke’s Drive” (formed in 1795 by the\r\nthen Duke of Devonshire): it runs through Ashwood Dale, Miller’s Dale,\r\nand Monsal Dale, passing “the Lover’s Leap” and “Chee Tor”—stupendous\r\ncrags, from the crevices of which grow small trees, partially crowned\r\nand covered with ivy, ferns, and lichens, groups of varied foliage\r\nintervening; with here and there umbrageous woods; and the river\r\nWye—not the “sylvan Wye, thou wanderer through the woods,” of\r\nWordsworth, but its namesake of lesser fame, that has its source a mile\r\nor two north of Buxton—journeying all the way, until at Rowsley it\r\njoins the Derwent (not the Derwent of the English lakes), from whence\r\nthe blended waters, running by Matlock, Belper, and Derby, flow into\r\nthe Trent, and so make their way to the sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Haddon, from the Meadows on the Bakewell Road._]\r\n\r\nTo give a list of the several objects that delight the eye and mind\r\nduring this comparatively short drive, would fill more pages than we\r\nhave at our disposal. The lowest part of the town of Buxton is one\r\nthousand feet above the level of the sea; the naturalist, the botanist,\r\nand the geologist will find treasure-troves in any of the surrounding\r\nhills and valleys: while natural marvels abound, within a few miles,\r\nin all directions—such as Poole’s Hole, the Blue-John Mine, the Ebbing\r\nand Flowing Well, and the Peak Cavern, with its summit crowned by the\r\nfine old castle of “Peveril of the Peak.” Majestic Chatsworth—to\r\nwhich, on certain days, the people are admitted, the park being at all\r\ntimes freely open to all comers—is distant about three miles from\r\nHaddon, across Manners Wood and intervening hills: in short, there are\r\na hundred places of deep interest within a drive of Buxton, and, if it\r\nbe a long drive, Dovedale—the loveliest dale in England—is easily\r\nreached; so, indeed, is far-famed Alton Towers.\r\n\r\nFrom Manchester and Buxton the way to Haddon is through the ancient\r\ntown of Bakewell, to the venerable parish church of which we shall, in\r\ndue course, conduct the reader—for it contains the monuments of THE\r\nVERNONS. But before entering the old Hall, we must ask the reader to\r\nglance at another route to Haddon—that which he will probably take if\r\nhis tour be made direct from London.\r\n\r\nNo doubt many visitors to Haddon will start from DERBY; and if the road\r\nfrom Buxton is charming, so also is that from the capital of the shire:\r\nit is more open; the vales are wider; the views are more extensive;\r\nthere are the same attractions of hill and dell and rock and river;\r\ncottages embosomed in foliage; church steeples seen among richly-clad\r\ntrees; clean and happy-looking villages; and distant towns, never\r\nindicated, except in one case—that of Belper—by the chimneys and\r\nsullen shadows of manufactories. For more than twenty miles there is an\r\nunbroken continuation of scenic loveliness, such as, in its calm and\r\nquiet charm, its simple grace, and all the attractions of home nature,\r\ncan be found nowhere else in the wide world.\r\n\r\nLeaving Derby, and passing by the famous “Boar’s Head” cotton\r\nmanufactory of Messrs. Evans on the left, and Breadsall on the right,\r\nthe first station arrived at is Duffield, a delightful village, where\r\nwas once the castle of the Peverels, and so on to Belper, famous for\r\nits cotton mills of the Messrs. Strutt; thence through a delightful\r\ncountry to the pleasant Junction of Ambergate, from whence the railway\r\nruns by the picturesque village of Cromford, the creation of one\r\ngreat man, Sir Richard Arkwright; Matlock Bath, the most popular and\r\nbeautiful of inland watering-places, whose villa residences peep out\r\nfrom the heights in every direction, and whose “High Tor” frowns down\r\nupon the railway beneath; Matlock Bridge, whose hill-side of Matlock\r\nBank is studded with famous hydropathic establishments; and Darley\r\nDale, with its fine old church, and grand old yew tree, the largest in\r\nthe kingdom, until the train stops at Rowsley. Here the passenger for\r\nHaddon, or Chatsworth, will alight, and here he will find conveyances,\r\nshould he care to ride on. Here too he will find a pleasant hostel,\r\n“The Peacock,” in which to refresh the inner man.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Peacock at Rowsley._]\r\n\r\n“The Peacock” at Rowsley is one of the prettiest and pleasantest inns\r\nin “all England:” it has ever been in high favour with “brethren of\r\nthe angle”—long before the neat and graceful railway station stood\r\nso near it that the whistle of the train is audible a dozen times a\r\nday, and twice or thrice at night. The fine old bridge close at hand\r\nthrows its arches across the Derwent; neatly and gracefully trimmed\r\ngardens skirt the banks of that clear and bright river, into which\r\nflows the Wye about a furlong off; and rivers, meadows, rocks and\r\ndells, and hills and valleys “all round about,” exhibit to perfection\r\nthe peculiarities of the vale, so rich in the beautiful and the\r\npicturesque. “The Peacock” is the nearest inn to Haddon; and here\r\nhundreds of travellers from all parts of the world have found not only\r\na tranquil resting-place, but a cheerful home.[37] We have thought it\r\nwell to picture it, and have placed at its doors one of the waggonettes\r\nthat drive hither and thither from Buxton and other places; and the\r\ntourist may rest assured that this pretty inn is indeed a place at\r\nwhich he may “rest, and be thankful.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Haddon, from the Rowsley Road._]\r\n\r\nAt Rowsley the tourist is but three miles from Chatsworth, and two\r\nmiles from Haddon. A pleasant walk through the valley brings him in\r\nsight of Haddon Hall; and from this road he obtains, perhaps, the best\r\nview of it. Partly hidden, as it is, by tall and full-leaved trees,\r\nits grandeur is not at once apparent; but the impression deepens as he\r\nascends the steep pathway and pauses before the nail-studded door that\r\nopens into the court-yard.\r\n\r\nBefore we proceed to describe the HALL, however, we shall give\r\nsome accounts of its earlier owners—the VERNONS—reserving for an\r\nafter-part the history of their successors, the illustrious family of\r\nMANNERS, from their origin, as knights, to the period of their high\r\nelevation, as Earls and Dukes of Rutland, and so down to the present\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe history of Haddon, unlike that of most of our ancient baronial\r\nresidences, has always been one of peace and hospitality, not of war\r\nand feud and oppression; and however much its owners may, at one period\r\nor other, have been mixed up in the stirring events of the ages in\r\nwhich they lived, Haddon itself has taken no part in the turmoils. It\r\nhas literally been a stronghold: but it has been the stronghold of home\r\nand domestic life, not of armed strife.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Arms of Vernon quartering Avenell._]\r\n\r\nHADDON, at the time of taking the Domesday survey, when the manor of\r\nBakewell belonged to, and was held by, the king, was a berewite of\r\nthe manor; and there one carucate of land was claimed by Henry de\r\nFerrars. Over-Haddon, a village two or three miles off, on the hills,\r\nwas also another berewite of the same manor. To whom Haddon belonged\r\nin the Saxon period is not clear; the first owner of which there is\r\nany distinct knowledge is this Henry de Ferrars, who held it in 1086,\r\nand who, by grant of the Conqueror, had no less than 114 manors in\r\nDerbyshire alone; he built Duffield Castle, and founded the Church of\r\nthe Holy Trinity, near the Castle of Tutbury.\r\n\r\nHaddon was at a very early period held, it is said, by tenure of\r\nknight’s service, by William Avenell, who resided there, and was\r\npossessed of much land in the neighbourhood. Soon after the foundation\r\nof Roche Abbey, in 1147, William de Avenell, Lord of Haddon, gave to\r\nthat establishment the grange of Oneash and its appurtenances. One\r\nof the daughters and co-heiresses of William de Avenell, Elizabeth,\r\nmarried Simon Bassett, of the fine old family of Bassett, owners of\r\nmuch property in this and the neighbouring counties; the other married\r\nRichard de Vernon; and thus Haddon passed into that noted family, of\r\nwhich we proceed to give some particulars.\r\n\r\nThe House of Vernon is of very considerable antiquity, and derives its\r\nname, as do many others in the Baronage of England, from its primitive\r\ndomicile in Normandy—the _Châtellenie_ of Vernon, forming one of\r\nthe territorial subdivisions of that country: the castle, with its\r\nhereditary lords, is recorded in the Anglo-Norman chronicles. According\r\nto the present territorial division of France, Vernon is a commune in\r\nthe _Département de l’Eure_ and _Arrondissement d’Evreux_; and as being\r\nthe _chef-lieu_, gives name to the canton in which it is situate. From\r\nthis locality, one of the most picturesque and luxuriant of the vine\r\ndistricts, the family of Vernon takes its origin; and also the ancient\r\nfamily of De Redvers—the two families, indeed, being originally\r\nidentical, the name of De Redvers having been assumed by a Vernon in\r\nthe eleventh century, from the place of his residence, Révière, in\r\nNormandy: his family were “Comtes de Révières and Vernon, and Barons\r\nde Néhou;” both families tracing from the d’Ivry stock. Mauriscus\r\nd’Ivry (father of Robert d’Ivry), who was father of Alselin Goël—the\r\nnames of whose sons, Roger Pincerna, surnamed “the stammerer,” Lord of\r\nthe Castle of Grossœuvre; William Lupellus (Lovel), who acquired the\r\ncastle of Ivry on the death of his elder brother; and Robert Goël—are\r\nwell known in history; the one as holding the Honour of Ivry in right\r\nof his descent from Count Ralph, uterine-brother of Richard I., Duke\r\nof Normandy; another as the founder of the family of Lovel; and the\r\nthird as having held his castle of Grossœuvre against King Stephen;\r\nhe had a son, Baldwin, who took the surname of De Revers from the\r\nplace of his residence: and two generations later, William, the son\r\nof Richard, assumed the name of Vernon, from the _Châtellenie_ of\r\nthat name which he held. His son, Hugh de Revers, or Vernon, usually\r\ncalled Hugh de Monachus, had a son, William de Vernon, Lord of Vernon,\r\nwho founded the Abbey of Montebourg. By his wife Emma he had issue\r\ntwo sons, Walter and Richard: the latter of whom, Richard de Redvers\r\n(as the name became afterwards spelled), or Vernon, came over at the\r\nConquest, and was created Baron of Shipbroke in Cheshire. He married\r\nAdeliza, daughter of William Peverel of Nottingham, and received with\r\nher in frank-marriage—that is, a free gift of an estate given with a\r\nwife on her marriage, and descendable to their joint heirs—the manor\r\nof Wolleigh, Buckinghamshire. One of these sons, Baldwin de Redvers,\r\nwas created Earl of Devon, and from him descended the line of earls of\r\nthat name; while William de Redvers, who inherited the Norman baronies\r\nof Vernon, Révières, and Néhou, re-assumed the surname of Vernon from\r\nthose possessions. He had an only son and heir, Hugh de Vernon, Baron\r\nof Shipbroke, who married a daughter of Raynold Badgioll, Lord of\r\nErdiswicke and Holgrave. By this lady he had a numerous issue: the\r\neldest, Warin, continuing the barony of Shipbroke; Matthew, inheriting\r\nthe lordships of Erdeswicke and Holgrave, who was ancestor of the\r\nVernons of those places, and Richard, already alluded to. This Richard\r\nde Vernon married Avice, the daughter and co-heiress of William de\r\nAvenell, Lord of Haddon; his other daughter and co-heiress marrying Sir\r\nSimon Bassett. By marriage with this lady Richard de Vernon acquired\r\nHaddon and other estates, and thus became settled at Haddon Hall.\r\nHe had issue, an only daughter and heiress, who married Gilbert le\r\nFrancis; and their son, Richard le Francis, took the name of Vernon,\r\non coming into the property, and settled at Haddon. He married Mary,\r\ndaughter of Robert, Baron of Stockport. His descendant, Sir Richard\r\nVernon, Lord of Haddon and of Appleby, &c., married Maude, daughter and\r\nco-heiress of William de Camville, by whom he had an only son and heir,\r\nWilliam Vernon, who was only ten years of age at his father’s death in\r\n1422, when he was found heir to his grandfather. In 1330 he obtained\r\na grant of free warren, or the exclusive right of killing beasts and\r\nbirds of warren within prescribed limits in the royal forests, &c.,\r\nfrom the king. He married Joan, daughter of Rhee, or Rhis, ap Griffith,\r\nand heiress of Richard Stackpole, and had issue by her Sir Richard\r\nVernon, Knt., of Pembrugge (sometimes called Sir Richard de Pembrugge),\r\nLord of Haddon and Tonge, which latter lordship he acquired by his\r\nmarriage with the sister and heiress of Sir Fulke de Pembrugge, or\r\nPembridge, Lord of Tonge in Shropshire. Their son, Richard Vernon, was\r\nfather of Richard Vernon, Treasurer of Calais, Captain of Rouen, and\r\nSpeaker in the Parliament at Leicester in 1426. By his wife, Benedict,\r\ndaughter of St. John Ludlow of Hodnet, he had issue, with others, Sir\r\nWilliam Vernon, Knt., who, marrying Margaret, daughter of Sir Robert\r\nPype of Spernore, acquired that manor and lordship. He was buried at\r\nTonge, where a monument was placed to his memory.\r\n\r\nHis son, or grandson, Sir Henry Vernon, was made governor to Prince\r\nArthur by King Henry VII., with whom he was a great favourite. He\r\nmarried Anne, daughter of John, second Earl of Shrewsbury, by Elizabeth\r\nButler, daughter of James, Earl of Ormond. By this marriage he had\r\nissue, Sir Henry Vernon, who was made High Steward of the King’s Forest\r\nin the Peak by Henry VIII., and held many other posts. He had issue,\r\ntwo sons, Sir George Vernon and Sir John Vernon. Sir Henry died in\r\n1515, and was succeeded by his oldest son, Sir George, “the King of the\r\nPeak,” who succeeded to the Haddon and other estates, as will presently\r\nbe shown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Arms of Lord Vernon._]\r\n\r\nSir John Vernon, Knt., married Helen, daughter and co-heiress of John\r\nMontgomery, of Sudbury, in Derbyshire, with whom he received the\r\nSudbury and other estates, and thus founded the family of Lords Vernon.\r\nHe was one of the King’s Council in Wales, and Custos Rotulorum of\r\nDerbyshire, and dying in 1540, was buried at Clifton Camville. He was\r\nsucceeded by his son, Henry Vernon, who, in his turn, was succeeded\r\nby his son, John Vernon, who married Mary, widow of Walter Vernon, of\r\nHoundhill, and daughter of Sir Edward Littleton, of Pillaton Hall,\r\nby whom, however, he had no issue. On his death in 1600, the estates\r\npassed to his stepson, Edward Vernon, the eldest son of his wife by her\r\nformer husband, the family consisting of three surviving sons—Edward,\r\nThomas, and Walter—and four daughters. By this lady, while a second\r\ntime a widow, Sudbury Hall is said to have been erected. Edward Vernon\r\nwas succeeded by his son, Henry Vernon, who married the sole daughter\r\nof Sir George Vernon, of Haslington, in Cheshire, and by her had\r\nissue a son, George, who succeeded him. This George Vernon was thrice\r\nmarried: first to Margaret, daughter of Edward Onely, by whom he had\r\nno issue; and, third, to Catherine, daughter of Sir Thomas Vernon,\r\nKnt., merchant, of London. By this lady he had a numerous family, and\r\nwas succeeded by his eldest and sole-surviving son and heir, Henry\r\nVernon, who married, first, Anne, sole daughter of Thomas Pigott,\r\nEsq., and heiress of her mother, who was sister and sole heiress of\r\nPeter Venables, last Baron Kinderton; and, second, Matilda, daughter\r\nof Thomas Wright, Esq., of Longston. Henry Vernon, who thus inherited\r\nthe estates of the Venables, assumed that surname in addition to his\r\nown. He had issue by his first wife, among others, a son, George\r\nVenables-Vernon, by whom he was succeeded. George Venables-Vernon\r\nmarried three times. By his first wife, the Hon. Mary Howard, daughter\r\nand co-heiress of Thomas Howard, sixth Lord Howard of Effingham, he had\r\nissue a son, the second Lord Vernon, and a daughter, Mary, married to\r\nGeorge Anson, of Orgrave, the father of the first Viscount Anson. By\r\nhis second wife, Anne, daughter of Sir Thomas Lee, he had no issue;\r\nbut by his third wife, Martha, sister to Simon Harcourt, first Earl\r\nHarcourt, he had a numerous family, as will be shown. This George\r\nVenables-Vernon was created Baron Vernon of Kinderton in 1762, and at\r\nhis death was succeeded in his titles and estates by the eldest son\r\nof his first marriage, George Venables-Vernon, as second Lord Vernon,\r\nwho married, first, the Hon. Louisa Barbarina, daughter of Bussey,\r\nLord Mansell, by whom he had an only daughter, who died unmarried;\r\nand, second, to Georgiana, daughter of William Fanquier, Esq., by whom\r\nhe had also an only daughter, Georgiana, married to Lord Suffield.\r\nHis lordship was succeeded in title and estates by his brother, the\r\nHon. Henry Vernon, as third Lord Vernon. This nobleman—whose brother\r\nEdward took the surname of Harcourt, and became Archbishop of York,\r\nand one of whose sisters, as has been shown, married the father of\r\nthe first Viscount Anson, and another, Elizabeth, became the wife of\r\nGeorge Simon, second Lord Harcourt—married twice. By his first wife,\r\nElizabeth Rebecca Anne, daughter of Charles Sedley, Esq., of Nuttall,\r\nhis lordship had issue two daughters (one of whom the Hon. Catherine,\r\ndied unmarried; and the other, the Hon. Louisa Henrietta, married the\r\nRev. Brooke Boothby, Prebendary of Southwell) and one son, George\r\nCharles Venables-Vernon, who succeeded him as fourth Lord Vernon. This\r\nnobleman married, in 1802, Frances Maria, daughter and heiress of\r\nSir John Borlase Warren, Bart., K.B., of Stapleford, by whom he had\r\nissue the Hon. George John Venables-Vernon, fifth Lord Vernon, who\r\nassumed the surname of Warren by sign manual in 1837, for himself and\r\nthe children only who should be born after that date. His lordship\r\nmarried twice: first to Isabella Caroline, eldest daughter of Cuthbert\r\nEllison, Esq., M.P., by whom he had issue the present Lord Vernon,\r\nand the Hon. William John Borlase Warren Venables-Vernon (who assumed\r\nthe additional surname of Warren), and three daughters; and second,\r\nin 1859, his cousin, Frances Maria Emma, daughter of the Rev. Brooke\r\nBoothby, who still survives him, without issue. Lord Vernon, as the\r\nHon. George John Vernon, was M.P. for Derbyshire from 1830 until, on\r\nthe death of his father, he entered the Upper House. He was one of the\r\nmost energetic supporters of the rifle movement, being himself the most\r\nskilful rifle-shooter of his day, carrying off the principal prizes at\r\nthe various Swiss Tirs, as well as elsewhere. As a scholar his lordship\r\nranked very high, and the “Dante,” edited by him, is the most sumptuous\r\nwork of its kind ever attempted. Lord Vernon died in 1866, and was\r\nsucceeded by his eldest son, the Hon. Augustus Henry Venables-Vernon,\r\nas sixth Lord Vernon, the present peer, who was born in Rome in 1829,\r\nand was Captain in the Scots Fusilier Guards, and Captain Commandant\r\nof the Second Battalion of Derbyshire Rifle Volunteers. His lordship\r\nmarried, in 1851, Lady Hariet Anson, daughter of the Earl of Lichfield,\r\nby whom he has issue two sons and four daughters.\r\n\r\nHaving now shown the descent of the Lords Vernon from the old lords of\r\nHaddon, we return to the “King of the Peak”—Sir George Vernon—and\r\nhis heiresses. He, as has been stated, succeeded to the estates in\r\n1515, and at the time of his death, in 1567, was possessed of no fewer\r\nthan thirty manors in Derbyshire alone. He was married twice: first,\r\nto Margaret, daughter of Sir Gilbert Taylebois, Knt.; and, secondly,\r\nto Maude, daughter of Sir Ralph Langford. He had issue, two daughters,\r\nhis co-heiresses, Margaret and Dorothy, whose husbands inherited his\r\nimmense possessions. Margaret Vernon married Sir Thomas Stanley, Knt.,\r\nof Winwick, in Lancashire, second son of Edward Stanley, third Earl of\r\nDerby; and Dorothy Vernon, whose name has become “a household word” in\r\nthis locality, married Sir John Manners, Knt., second son of Thomas\r\nManners, first Earl of Rutland, and direct ancestor of the present Duke\r\nof Rutland. To this branch we shall presently have to refer at greater\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nSir George Vernon lived at Haddon in such a style of princely\r\nmagnificence and hospitality as to earn for himself the title of “King\r\nof the Peak.” It is said that he was generous and hospitable, as well\r\none of as just and strict, of men, although given perhaps to undue\r\nseverity and to an indulgence in “Lynch law;” and that he lived and\r\ndied in the “good esteem” of all men.\r\n\r\nOne tradition, briefly told, will sufficiently illustrate the firmness\r\nand decision of his character, and the power he held over the actions\r\nand even the lives of the people around him. It is related that a\r\npedlar who had been hawking his wares in the neighbourhood was found\r\nmurdered in a lonely spot. He had been seen the evening before to enter\r\na cottage, and never afterwards seen alive. As soon as Sir George\r\nbecame aware of the fact of the crime having been committed, he had the\r\nbody of the pedlar removed to Haddon, laid in the hall, and covered\r\nwith a sheet. He then sent for the cottager to come immediately, and,\r\non his arrival, at once questioned him as to where the pedlar was who\r\nwas seen to enter his house the night before. The man denied having\r\nseen him or knowing anything about him; when Sir George uncovered the\r\nbody before him, ordering that all persons present should touch the\r\nbody in succession, at the same time declaring their innocence of the\r\nmurder. The suspected man, when his turn came, declined to touch the\r\nbody, and instantly rushed out of the Hall, and made his way, “as fast\r\nas his legs could carry him,” through Bakewell and towards Ashford.\r\nSir George instantly ordered his men to mount and follow him, and to\r\nhang him wherever they caught him. The murderer was caught in a field\r\nopposite the present toll-bar at Ashford, and at once hanged, and the\r\nfield still bears the name of the “Gallows Acre,” or “Galley Acre.”\r\nSir George is said to have been cited to London for this extraordinary\r\npiece of Lynch law, and when he appeared in court he was summoned twice\r\nto surrender as “the King of the Peak.” To these he made no reply, and\r\nthe third time he was called on as Sir George Vernon, when he stepped\r\nforward and acknowledged himself—“Here am I!” Having been summoned as\r\n“the King of the Peak,” the indictment fell through, and Sir George\r\nwas admonished and discharged. Sir George Vernon is buried in Bakewell\r\nChurch, where a remarkably fine and well-preserved altar-tomb bears the\r\nrecumbent effigies of himself and his two wives.\r\n\r\nDorothy Vernon, the youngest daughter and co-heiress of Sir George, and\r\nover whom such “a halo of romantic interest” rests, is said to have\r\nbeen one of the most beautiful of all beautiful women, and possessed\r\nof so sweet a temper, that she was idolised by all who knew her. If it\r\nwere so, however, the monument at Bakewell does not fairly represent\r\nher, for it exhibits her with an expression of countenance far from\r\neither amiable or attractive. The story of her life, according to\r\npopular belief, is that, while her elder sister, fortunate in an open\r\nattachment to Sir Thomas Stanley, the son of the Earl of Derby, and\r\nhis affianced bride, was petted and “made much of,” she, the younger,\r\nwas kept in the background, having formed a secret attachment to\r\nJohn Manners, son of the Earl of Rutland—an attachment which was\r\nopposed by her father, sister, and stepmother; she was, therefore,\r\nclosely watched, and kept almost a prisoner. Her lover is said to have\r\ndisguised himself as a woodman, or forester, and to have remained\r\nin hiding in the woods around Haddon for several weeks, in order to\r\nobtain stolen glances of, and occasional brief meetings with, Dorothy.\r\nAt length, on a festive night at Haddon—tradition states it to have\r\nbeen on one of the “merry meetings,” consequent on the marriage of her\r\nsister Margaret—Dorothy is said to have stolen away unobserved in the\r\nmidst of the merriment in the ball-room, and to have quietly passed out\r\nof the door of the adjoining ante-room on to the terrace, which she\r\ncrossed, and having ascended the steps on the other side, her lover’s\r\narms received her; horses were in waiting, and they rode off in the\r\nmoonlight all through the night, and were married in Leicestershire\r\nthe next morning. The door through which the heiress eloped is always\r\npointed out to visitors as “Dorothy Vernon’s Door.”\r\n\r\nThus the Derbyshire estates of Sir George Vernon passed to John\r\nManners, and thus it was the noble house of Rutland became connected\r\nwith Haddon and the county of Derby.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Haddon: from the Meadows._]\r\n\r\nJohn Manners, the husband of Dorothy Vernon, was knighted shortly\r\nafter his marriage. They had issue three sons: Sir George Manners, who\r\nsucceeded to the estates; John Manners, who died in 1590, aged 14; and\r\nSir Roger Manners of Whitwell, who died in 1650; also one daughter,\r\nGrace, who became the wife of Sir Francis Fortescue. Dorothy died\r\nin 1584, and her husband in 1611. They were both buried in Bakewell\r\nChurch, where their monument will no doubt be looked upon with interest\r\nby all visitors to the district.\r\n\r\nHaddon continued to be one of the residences of this branch of the\r\nManners family, ennobled in 1641 by the inheritance of the Rutland\r\npeerage, until they quitted it in the early part of the last century\r\nfor Belvoir Castle, of which we shall, on a future occasion, take note.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Main Entrance._]\r\n\r\nThe HALL stands on a natural elevation—a platform of limestone—above\r\nthe eastern bank of the Wye: the river is crossed by a pretty, yet\r\nvenerable, bridge, passing which, we are at the foot of the rock,\r\nimmediately fronting the charming cottage which is the lodge of\r\nthe custodian who keeps the keys. In the garden we make our first\r\nacquaintance with the boar’s head and the peacock—shaped from growing\r\nyew-trees—the crests of the families whose dwelling we are about to\r\nenter. This cottage adjoins the old stables; their antiquity is denoted\r\nby several sturdy buttresses. To the right of the great entrance-door\r\nare the steps—placed there long ago—to assist ladies in mounting\r\ntheir steeds, when ladies used to travel sitting on a pillion behind\r\nthe rider: the custom is altogether gone out; but in our younger days,\r\nnot only did the farmer’s wife thus journey to market, but dames of\r\ndistinction often availed themselves of that mode of visiting, carrying\r\nhood and farthingale, and hoop also, in leathern panniers at their\r\nsides, and jewels for ornament in caskets on their laps.\r\n\r\nThe visitor now stands before the old gateway, with its massive\r\nnail-studded door, and will note the noble flight of freestone steps,\r\nwhere time and use have left the marks of frequent footsteps. Indeed,\r\nthe top step—just opposite the small entrance wicket in the larger\r\ndoor—is actually worn through in the shape of a human foot. He will\r\nalso notice the extreme beauty and elegance of design of the Gothic\r\narchitecture of this part of the building, and the heraldic bearings\r\nwith which it is decorated. Beneath the entrance archway on the right\r\nis the guard-room of the “sturdy porter” of old times: his “peep-hole”\r\nis still there, the framework of his bedstead, and the fire-place that\r\ngave him comfort when keeping watch and ward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAfter mounting the inner steps, the visitor passes into the first\r\ncourt-yard, and will not fail to notice the remarkable character of the\r\nsplaying and chamfering of the building in the angle over the inner\r\narchway. This is one of the most remarkable features of the building.\r\nIts strange character is to some extent occasioned by the winding of a\r\ndouble spiral stone staircase, leading to the tower over the entrance\r\narchway. The inside of this gateway, with the enormous hoop, said to\r\nhave been the hoop of a mash-tub, hanging on the wall, is shown in our\r\nvignette.\r\n\r\nWe are now in the lower court-yard, and at once perceive that Haddon\r\nconsists of two court-yards, or quadrangles, with buildings surrounding\r\neach. Immediately opposite the gateway are the stone steps that lead\r\nto the state apartments; to the right is the chapel, and to the left,\r\nthe HALL proper, with its minstrels’ gallery and other objects of\r\ncurious—some of unique interest. The general arrangement will be\r\nbest understood by the ground-plan, which, however, requires some\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GROUND AND GARDEN PLAN OF HADDON]\r\n\r\nOn account of the abruptness of the slope on which Haddon is built, it\r\nstands so unevenly, that a horizontal line drawn from the ground in the\r\narchway under the Peverel Tower would pass _over_ the entrance archway.\r\nConsequently, that archway, the porter’s lodge, and entrance to the\r\nspiral staircase on its right hand, and on the left the two rooms\r\nentered from the walk behind the partition wall, and before mounting\r\nthe steps, form what may, looking at it in that light, be called a\r\nbasement story, to which also belongs the cellar, entered by a flight\r\nof fourteen steps descending from the buttery. Lysons, in his “Magna\r\nBritannia,” vol. v., engraves—first, a basement plan, comprising the\r\nentrance archway and the low rooms above alluded to; second, a ground\r\nplan; third, a plan of the upper floor, including the ball-room and\r\nother state rooms; and the numerous bed-rooms and other apartments on\r\nthe north and west sides. These plans are extremely correct and minute:\r\nit transpires from letters in the Lysons’ correspondence (Addit.\r\nMS. 9,423, British Museum), that they were made by the surveyor of\r\nthe then duke, to illustrate a little privately printed account of\r\nHaddon, written by himself, and were lent to Lysons for his work by\r\nD’Ewes Coke, Esq., barrister-at-law, then steward to the duke. The\r\ndesignations given by Lysons to the apartments are therefore probably\r\ncorrect. From his lists, and a curious catalogue of the apartments\r\nat Haddon, date 1666, we gather the general inference that the rooms\r\non the west side of the lower court were, in the latter days of its\r\noccupation, occupied by the officials of the household; those on the\r\nentire south side were the state rooms; those on the east side of the\r\nupper court were the family apartments—the bed-rooms extending down\r\nto the intersection of the lower court; those over the front archway,\r\n&c., were the nursery apartments; and the library is believed to have\r\noccupied the rooms between these and the entrance tower.\r\n\r\nThere are second-floor apartments, not planned in Lysons, over the\r\nPeverel Tower and its adjoining rooms, and over one half of the north\r\nside, from that tower to the junction of the courts. Also solitary\r\nsecond-floor rooms in the Entrance Tower, Central Tower, and over the\r\nstaircase leading to the ball-room. There is but one third-floor room,\r\nit is in the Eagle Tower, and is the highest apartment in the Hall.\r\n\r\nThe plan we engrave will be found the most useful to visitors. It gives\r\nthe ground-plan irrespective of levels (which would only be bewildering\r\nto the visitor), with the exception of the slightly elevated ball-room\r\nand state-rooms in the upper court-yard. In fact, from even these being\r\nentered from the terrace, the whole of the plan we have prepared may,\r\nfor _general_ purposes, be said to be that of the ground-floor.\r\n\r\nOn the east side there are but slight differences between the\r\nground-floor and first-floor rooms, excepting those over the kitchen\r\nand adjoining offices, and over the central archway. On the south side\r\nthe differences are material. The ball-room covers six ground-floor\r\ncellar rooms. The drawing-room is over the dining-room; and the earl’s\r\nbed-chamber and other rooms are over the long narrow ground-floor\r\npassages between that and the chapel. On the west side also the\r\narrangement differs considerably.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The first Court-yard._]\r\n\r\nSome portions of the building are of undoubted Norman origin, and\r\nit is not unlikely that even they were grafted on a Saxon erection.\r\nNorman remains will be noticed in the chapel, and, therefore, it is\r\ncertain that that portion of the building, as well as others which\r\ncould be pointed out, are the same as when the place was owned by the\r\nPeverels and Avenells. Before the year 1199, John, Earl of Morteigne,\r\nafterwards King John, by writ directed to his justices, sheriffs,\r\nbailiffs, ministers, and all his lieges, granted a licence to Richard\r\nde Vernon to fortify his house of Haddon with a wall to the height of\r\ntwelve feet, without kernel (or _crenelle_, which was an open parapet\r\nor battlement with embrasures or loopholes to shoot through), and\r\nforbidding his being disturbed in so doing. This interesting licence,\r\nnow in possession of the Duke of Rutland, is as follows:—“Johannes\r\ncom. Moret. justic. vice-com. baillivis, ministris, et omnibus\r\nfidelibus suis salutem. Sciatis me concessisse et licenciam dedisse\r\nRic. de Vern. firmandi domum suum de Heddon, muro exaltato xij pedibus\r\nsine kernello, et idem prohibeo nequis vestrum eum inde disturbet.\r\nTest. Rob. de Mara apud Clipeston.” It is endorsed “Breve patens Com.\r\nJohannis.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gateway under the Eagle Tower._]\r\n\r\nThe earliest portions of the buildings of Haddon now remaining appear\r\nto be a part of the chapel, and lower portions of the walls of the\r\nsouth front and of the north-east tower. To the next period, from 1300\r\nto about 1380 (according to Duesbury), belong the hall-porch, the\r\nmagnificent kitchen and adjoining offices, the great or banqueting\r\nhall, the lower west window of the chapel, part of the north-east\r\ntower, and part of the cellarage under the long gallery. In the third\r\nperiod, from about 1380 to 1470, were added the east, and part of the\r\nwest end of the chapel, and the remaining buildings on the east side of\r\nthe upper court-yard. The fourth period, from 1470 to 1530, comprises\r\nthe fittings and interior finishings of the dining-room, the western\r\nrange of buildings in the lower court, and the west end of the north\r\nrange. The fifth period, from about 1530 to 1624, seems to comprise\r\nalterations in the upper court-yard, the long gallery, and terrace and\r\ngardens; the pulpit, desk, and pews in the chapel; and the barn and\r\nbowling-green. The juxtaposition of the kitchen and great hall show\r\nthat they belong to the same period. The alterations since that period\r\nappear mainly to have been necessary repairs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Chaplain’s Room._]\r\n\r\nThe principal apartments of Haddon Hall are the Chapel, the Great, or\r\nBanqueting-Hall, with the Minstrels’ Gallery occupying two sides of it;\r\nthe Dining-room; the Drawing-room; the earl’s Bed-room and adjoining\r\nsuite of rooms; the Ball-room, or Long Gallery; the Ante-room, from\r\nwhich Dorothy Vernon’s door opens on to the terrace; the State\r\nBed-room; the Ancient State Room, or Page’s Room; the Kitchens; and\r\nthe Eagle, or Peverel, or King John’s Tower. The entrance in this\r\nlatter was the principal entrance to the Hall, and communicated with\r\nRowsley and Bakewell by an old road which still exists. It was the\r\nonly entrance by which horsemen or carriages could enter the Hall.\r\nThe gateway by which visitors now enter, being intended only for\r\nfoot-approach, mounted guests had to leave their horses at the gate.\r\nPassing in by this gateway, the visitor enters the first, or lower\r\ncourt-yard, and sees around him the chief features of this once gay,\r\nbut now deserted mansion, grand in its solitude and attractive in its\r\nloneliness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Chapel._]\r\n\r\nThe first room usually shown to visitors is the so-called CHAPLAIN’S\r\nROOM, the first door on the right, after mounting the steps into the\r\nlower court. In this small room, and in the closet attached to it,\r\nseveral objects of interest are preserved. Among these are a pair of\r\nremarkably fine fire-dogs, a warder’s horn, gigantic jack-Boots,\r\na thick leathern doublet, some matchlocks and some pewter dishes.\r\nIn this room, a few years ago, a remarkably curious and interesting\r\nwashing-tally, engraved and described in the “Reliquary,” was found\r\nbehind the wainscoting. The articles enumerated on this curious\r\nrelic are “ruffes,” “bandes,” “cuffes,” “handkercher,” “capps,”\r\n“shirtes,” “halfshirts,” “boote hose,” “topps,” “sockes,” “sheetes,”\r\n“pillowberes,” “tableclothes,” “napkins,” and “towells.” It is in the\r\npossession of the Duke of Rutland.\r\n\r\nThe CHAPEL, which, after the so-called Chaplain’s Room, is the first\r\npart of the interior of Haddon Hall shown to visitors, is, as will\r\nbe seen by reference to the ground-plan, at the south-east corner of\r\nthe building. It consists, at present, of a nave with side aisle and\r\na chancel, and is entered from the court-yard by an arched doorway\r\nopening into a small ante-chapel, or vestibule, through which the\r\nvisitor passes. At the entrance is a _stoup_, or holy-water basin, and\r\nfrom the ante-chapel a staircase leads up to the turret. The arches\r\nand pillars of the nave are Norman; but the arches have been cut from\r\ntheir original semicircular to their present arched form, and the\r\npillars cut and “shaved down,” and their capitals altered in character.\r\nSufficient of these capitals, however, remains to show what was their\r\noriginal design. At the west end of the nave is a remarkably fine and\r\nlarge vestment chest of very thick timber, having carved on its front\r\ntwo shields of arms. At the opposite (east) end of the nave is a carved\r\ncorbel, and, on the floor, is the fine old altar-table of stone bearing\r\nthe usual five incised _crosses pattée_, emblematical of the five\r\nwounds of our blessed Saviour.\r\n\r\nAgainst one of the pillars is a massive circular Norman font, on which\r\nis a curiously constructed cover. This font is engraved on the next\r\npage, but unfortunately the artist has omitted the cover. The chancel\r\nis raised a little above the nave; and on each side is a large high\r\npew, with open railings in their upper portions, which have been used\r\nfor the noble families who have inhabited the place; and the carved\r\npanels, and the traces of gilding and colour they contain, show, along\r\nwith the remains of paintings on the walls, how magnificent must have\r\nbeen this place of worship in its palmy days.\r\n\r\nThe chapel consists of a nave with two aisles of unequal width, and a\r\nchancel. The entire length of the chapel is 49 feet, the chancel being\r\n28 feet long, and the nave 21 feet. Each aisle has an arcade of two\r\npointed arches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Norman Font in the Chapel._]\r\n\r\nThe entrance to the chapel is on the north side, near to the west end.\r\nThe different parts of the chapel appear to be of about the following\r\ndates, viz.:—\r\n\r\nThe south aisle, and centre circular column of its arcade, A.D. 1160.\r\nThe five windows of this aisle are each of a single light and pointed.\r\nThe capital of the circular column of the arcade has been cut so as to\r\nfit the arches subsequently erected over it. The lower west window,\r\nand the north aisle (except the doorway), and the north arcade, are\r\nabout _A.D._ 1310. A window of this aisle formerly existed to the east\r\nof the doorway, but was blocked up when a staircase was made in the\r\nvestibule of the chapel, to give access to a small room. The chancel,\r\nthe clerestory of the nave, and the south arcade, except the circular\r\ncolumn, are of about 1425, at which time the glass of the east window\r\nwas put in by Richard Vernon, as recorded in an inscription on the\r\nwindow itself. The bell-turret is supposed to have been erected by\r\nWilliam, son of Richard Vernon, about 1455. The letter W, supposed\r\nto be his initial, is carved on the outside of its wall, towards the\r\ncourt-yard. The blocking up of the window of the north aisle, and the\r\nconstruction of the entrance doorway, may be of the same date. William\r\nVernon married Margaret de Pype; and the Pype arms are on one of the\r\nsouth windows of the chancel.\r\n\r\nThe partial removal of the whitewash of the chapel walls, in 1858, led\r\nto several discoveries of the former arrangements of the building, and\r\nof the coloured decorations of the walls; and, were it desirable, a\r\ncomplete restoration of the interior to its former state would not be\r\ndifficult.\r\n\r\nThere were two altars in the chapel—one at the east end, as usual,\r\nand one under the east window of the south aisle. This latter was, no\r\ndoubt, a chantry. The stone slabs which formed the tops of the altars\r\nstill exist, and are raised, to the extent of their thickness, above\r\nthe floor: the east altar-stone is 8 feet by 3 feet, and is 8 inches\r\nthick, the edge being a fillet of 3 inches, and a chamfer; the surface\r\nis so decayed that only one of its original five _crosses pattée_ now\r\nremains.\r\n\r\nThe altar-stone of the south aisle is 5 feet 6 inches by 2 feet 6\r\ninches, the edge showing a fillet and chamfer. The five _crosses\r\npattée_ on it are still perfect. The piscina in the chancel still\r\nremains, recessed in a fenestella.\r\n\r\nThe sill of the south window, near the altar, is low, so as to form a\r\nsedilia bench. In the middle of the sloping sill of the east window\r\na step has been cut, no doubt for the crucifix to stand on; and on\r\neach side of it is a similar step, probably for candlesticks. On the\r\neast wall, on each side of the window, is a stone bracket, probably to\r\nsupport an image.\r\n\r\nOn the east wall of the south aisle there is a bracket with a grotesque\r\nhead, which was probably intended to support a figure. There are signs\r\nof a large bracket having existed on the north side of the altar; and\r\nthe base-mould of a small column, which possibly supported its front\r\nedge, may be seen on a block of stone rising above the pavement.\r\n\r\nA very remarkable squint was discovered and reopened in 1859 in the\r\nsouth-west angle of the chancel, through which a view of the priest\r\nofficiating at the chantry altar could be obtained from the rood-loft\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nIn the wall, opposite to this squint, is a doorway, which gave passage\r\nfrom the bell-turret to the rood-loft. The sill of this doorway is 13\r\nfeet 9 inches above the chapel floor. The bell itself is now (1871)\r\nin use at the new church at Rowsley. It had been taken down from the\r\nturret many years ago.\r\n\r\nTwo fragments of the open-work of the rood-screen may be seen in the\r\nwest ends of the chancel pews. They are carved in oak.\r\n\r\nThe font, which is round and perfectly plain, is of the Norman period,\r\nand probably of the same date as the early part of the chapel. It is\r\nnot in its original position. The stoup for holy water is near the\r\nentrance door of the chapel.\r\n\r\nThe windows are not architecturally remarkable, but the glass is\r\ndeserving of careful attention. It gives an excellent example of\r\nvery good effect produced by very simple means, and excluding very\r\nlittle light from the interior. Each principal light in the east\r\nwindow, and each light in the head, has a single figure. The drawing,\r\nboth in expression and in the grace of the drapery, is often very\r\ngood. Yellow stain is extensively employed, but otherwise colour is\r\nsparingly, though very effectively used. There are no canopies, or\r\nother architectural accessories. The quarries, forming the groundwork\r\nof the windows, come close up to the figures. There are eight patterns\r\nof quarries remaining, besides six birds, each of a different form.\r\nMost of these patterns are good, and the whole of them may be found in\r\nthe east window, except one which is in the south-west window of the\r\nchancel.\r\n\r\nThe east window has five lights. Much of the glass has been destroyed;\r\nwhat remains was re-leaded in 1858, and arranged according to the\r\noriginal design. No new coloured glass was introduced, but some old\r\nquarries were collected from other windows of the chapel, and placed\r\nin the east window to complete the groundwork. In the centre light\r\nthe figure of our Saviour on the cross is nearly perfect. In the next\r\nlight, on either side, is a figure more or less mutilated, and each has\r\nlost the head. One of them represents the Virgin; the other appears to\r\nbe St. John, though, apparently through some mistake of the artist, he\r\nhas the emblems of St. John the Baptist. The figures of the two outer\r\nlights are entirely gone. The emblems of two of the evangelists remain.\r\nIn the lights of the head are figures of saints, generally well drawn.\r\nBelow the principal figures of this window are three shields of arms,\r\nsupported by angels, gracefully drawn. These arms are, _argent_, a lion\r\nrampant _gules_, ducally crowned, _or_; _argent_, fretty, _sable_, a\r\ncanton of the first; and another shield, the bearing on which has been\r\nlost. At the bottom of the window are the remains of an inscription to\r\nSir Richard Vernon and Benedict Ludlow his wife, as follows:—_Orate\r\npro āiābus Ricardi Vernon et Benedicite uxoris eius qui fecerunt anō\r\nd̄ni milesimo_ CCCCXXVII. This Sir Richard Vernon, who was born in\r\n1391, and succeeded his father in 1401, married Benedict, daughter\r\nof Sir John Ludlow of Hodnet, and died in 1451. He was “Treasurer of\r\nCalais, Captain of Rouen, and Speaker of the Parliament of Leicester,\r\nin the fourth year of Henry VI. in 1426.” Above the crucifix are the\r\nroyal arms, quarterly, first and fourth France, second and third\r\nEngland. In the outer lights are a knight kneeling at a table, and\r\nfragments of an ecclesiastic.\r\n\r\nThe flat-headed windows on each side of the altar, in the north and\r\nsouth sides of the chancel, have each three principal lights, and\r\nsix lights in the heads, each containing the figure of an apostle,\r\neffectively drawn.\r\n\r\nThe centre light of the north window has a figure of the Virgin being\r\ntaught to read by St. Anne. To the right of this, as we face the\r\nwindow, is the figure of St. George slaying the dragon, and in the\r\nother light is the figure of St. Michael trampling on a six-headed\r\ndragon. Beneath, there are three mutilated shields of arms of Vernon,\r\n&c., and in the bottom of the window are the remains of a candlestick\r\nor hour-glass stand. In the south window are the arms of Pype, _azure_,\r\ncrucilly of cross-crosslets and two pipes in pale, _or_; and those of\r\nVernon, _argent_, fretty, _sable_, on the dexter side of an impaled\r\nshield, the impalement on which is lost. Over the arms of Pype is the\r\nfragment of the original inscription, reading “Margareta Pype, vxo.”\r\n\r\nThe mural decorations, of which traces have been found, are of various\r\ncharacter and of much interest. The oldest fragments are two running\r\npatterns of good design. One is on the arches of the north arcade, and\r\nof the same date as the stonework on which it appears, viz., about\r\n1310. The other, which seems to be of the same age, is on one of the\r\njambs of the east window of the south aisle, over the altar. In this\r\nwindow there are traces of a figure, now almost entirely destroyed.\r\nOver the arches of the nave there are traces of two different designs,\r\none on each wall. Both are much defaced. On the west wall of the nave\r\nthere is a design consisting of a running pattern of rose branches\r\nand leaves, with red flowers of five petals. The stems and leaves are\r\nshaded grey and black. Traces of the same design have been found on the\r\nwalls of the south aisle, and on the jambs of its west window. The date\r\nof this rose pattern is probably about 1427, when the glass of the east\r\nwindow of the chancel was put in.\r\n\r\nThere is a pattern of green and dull red on the east wall of the\r\nchancel, and on the south wall is a very similar pattern, which\r\nenclosed four groups of figures, two on each side of the window over\r\nthe sedilia bench. There is no border surrounding each group, but\r\nmerely the diaper pattern. They are probably of the same date as the\r\nglass in the east window. The figures of these groups are generally\r\neffectively drawn, though with occasional exaggeration and distortion.\r\nThey are in distemper on the plaster, and are black, with the exception\r\nof some dresses, which are green. There are scrolls to each group,\r\ncorresponding with the number of figures, but without any name. These\r\ngroups had been much injured before they were covered with whitewash,\r\nand the injury appears as if partially intentional. The groups form\r\na series of subjects, and commence with the upper group on the east\r\nside of the window. The subject is the presentation of the Virgin\r\nin the Temple by Joachim and Anna. The three figures remain. Below\r\nthis is a group, much injured, apparently Anna teaching the Virgin to\r\nread, whilst Joachim stands by. Two of these groups, for which we are\r\nindebted to the “Reliquary,” are here shown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Wall-paintings in the Chapel._]\r\n\r\nThe upper group on the west is a Holy Family. The Virgin holds the\r\ninfant Jesus in her arms; St. Joseph stands by; St. John the Baptist\r\nraises his hands and eyes towards the infant Saviour.\r\n\r\nBelow this is a group, much injured, with four scrolls, and apparently\r\nfour figures. A female figure, probably the Virgin, seems to be\r\ncarrying a child, whilst a male figure follows behind. There seem to be\r\nindications of a fourth and small figure. The subject appears to be\r\nthe flight into Egypt, with, contrary to custom, the figure of St. John\r\nintroduced.\r\n\r\nTraces of colour are found on the fenestella of the piscina, on the\r\ncircular columns of the south arcade, and on the brackets near the\r\naltar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Steps to State Apartments._]\r\n\r\nLeaving the chapel, the visitor will cross the court-yard to the\r\nBANQUETING-HALL; but he will notice on his way a flight of stone steps\r\nleading from the court-yard, near the doorway of the ante-chapel, up\r\nto the state apartments, so that the family could attend the chapel\r\nwithout passing through the hall, and could also, with their guests, be\r\nadmitted at other times to their suite of rooms.\r\n\r\nIn this first court-yard he will also do well to take especial notice\r\nof the beautiful and intricate designs on the lead-work of the heads of\r\nthe spouts—many of which are filled with delicate Gothic tracery—and\r\nthe gargoyles, or water-spouts, some of which are grotesquely carved in\r\nfigures of curious character, and some of them of uncouth shape. One\r\nor two of these we have engraved on another page.\r\n\r\nEntering the open doorway of the advanced porch, which, with a wide\r\npassage adjoining, forms the way through to the inner, or second\r\ncourt-yard, the visitor will notice, standing on the stone bench on his\r\nleft hand, a fine Roman altar which, many years ago, was dug up in the\r\ngrounds. It bears the inscription,—\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Roman Altar, Haddon Hall._]\r\n\r\n  DEO\r\n  MARTI\r\n  BRACIACÆ\r\n  OSITTIVS\r\n  CAECILIANS\r\n  PRAEFECT\r\n  COH I AQVITANO\r\n  V S\r\n\r\nwhich may be rendered, “To the God Mars, Braciaca, Osittius,\r\nCaecilianus, Prefect of the first Cohort of the Aquitani, in\r\nperformance of a vow”—the term _Braciacæ_: as applied to Mars being\r\nsingular.\r\n\r\nTo the left of the passage four arched doorways conduct respectively\r\nto the buttery, the great kitchen, and other domestic offices, and to\r\na staircase leading to the long suite of chambers on the north side,\r\nand also communicating, by means of a gallery in the Banqueting-Hall,\r\nwith all the other apartments of the building. To the right is a\r\nmassive and time-worn oak screen, with two open doorways, which\r\ndivides the Banqueting-Hall from the passage. Entering by the first of\r\nthese openings in the screen, the visitor will not fail to notice a\r\nsuspicious-looking little iron bracket with ring attached, high above\r\nhis head. This, tradition says, was an instrument of punishment for\r\nenforcing the observance of laws of conviviality. For it is said, if,\r\nin the days of feasting and merriment in the “good old times,” a man\r\nshould fail to drink up his quota of liquor, he was fastened up by\r\nthe wrist to this ring, and the liquor poured down his sleeve so as\r\ngradually to trickle down him on to the floor; or, if guilty of any\r\nother breach of the law or decorum of the board, he was similarly tied\r\nup, and compelled so to remain during the carousal, and was treated now\r\nand then not only with a stream of cold water poured down his sleeve,\r\nbut by other indignities forced upon him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Banqueting-Hall: with the Minstrels’ Gallery._]\r\n\r\nThe BANQUETING-HALL, or GREAT HALL, as it is sometimes called,\r\nmeasures, within the screen, about 35 feet in length, and about 25\r\nin width, and it is of the full height of the building, with an open\r\ntimber roof. It is entered, as has just been stated, by two open\r\ndoorways in the screen which separates it from the passage. The screen\r\nalso forms the front of the MINSTRELS’ GALLERY over the passage. The\r\nscreen is beautifully panelled, each panel being headed with cinquefoil\r\ncusps, above which is other Gothic tracery of elegant design. At the\r\nopposite end from this screen is the raised daïs for the lord and his\r\nfamily and honoured guests, where still stands the grand old table on\r\nwhich so many of the good things of this life have been spread in ages\r\nlong since passed away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Old Oak Table in the Banqueting Hall._]\r\n\r\nThis table is one of the finest examples of its kind yet remaining\r\nanywhere in existence—it is now worm-eaten and decayed, like those who\r\nonce feasted around it; but still it stands, a proud monument of those\r\nancient times so long gone by. Over the daïs a modern window has been\r\ninserted, and formerly a doorway, to the left of the lord as he sat in\r\nthe centre of the large table, opened into what is now the dining-room,\r\nbut in those days was the withdrawing-room.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Hand-lock in the Banqueting-Hall._]\r\n\r\nTo the right hand, on entering, is the gigantic fire-place with its\r\nhuge open chimney; and on the opposite side, at the end next the high\r\ntable, a flight of steps leads up to the state apartments; and close\r\nby, through a corner partitioned off by the oak wainscoting, another\r\ndoor leads to the private dining-room and to the grounds. On the walls\r\nof the Banqueting-Hall are some magnificent stags’ heads and antlers,\r\nwhich bear evidence not only of extremely fine growth, but of great\r\nage, since they fell to the lord of the chase. There are also several\r\npieces of old furniture: and on the walls are oil-paintings of Martin\r\nMiddleton of Hazelbadge, and of an old and favourite huntsman and\r\ngamekeeper—honoured and respected retainers of the family.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Staircase to Minstrels’ Gallery._]\r\n\r\nThe galleried passage, of a later date, to the Minstrels’ Gallery,\r\noccupies one side, and the “Minstrels’ Gallery” itself one end, of the\r\nBanqueting-Hall—that portion of the gallery along the side forming a\r\npassage from the drawing-room and state apartments on one side to the\r\nrange of rooms on the other. The portion of the gallery over the end\r\nof the hall is considerably wider than the other, and would hold a\r\ngoodly company of minstrels, or of guests, to look down on the “lord of\r\nmisrule” and other revels below. In one of our engravings we show the\r\npanelled front of the Minstrels’ Gallery, and on the preceding page we\r\ngive a vignette of the entrance to the gallery from the drawing room.\r\n\r\nPassing out from the Banqueting-Hall, the visitor should next enter\r\nthe DINING-ROOM, which is one of the most charming, and certainly one\r\nof the most interesting, apartments in the whole building. The end\r\nopposite to the entrance doorway is entirely taken up by a Gothic\r\nwindow of eight lights, filled with glass disposed in an elaborate\r\ngeometric pattern. In some of the lights are shields of arms in stained\r\nglass, one of which displays the arms of Vernon with its quarterings\r\nof Avenell, Pype, &c., &c.; another, Vernon only; and another, Vernon\r\nimpaled. This room is wainscoted, the upper row of panels throughout\r\nbeing filled in with exquisitely-carved Gothic tracery and with\r\nheraldic bearings, &c.\r\n\r\nOver the centre of the fire-place are the royal arms of England\r\n(quarterly France and England) with the supporters, a greyhound and a\r\ngriffin, and on the one side a shield bearing the three feathers of the\r\nPrince of Wales, with the initials E. P., and on the other the arms\r\nof Vernon with its quarterings, and supported by a lion and a boar.\r\nBelow these is the motto, “DREDE GOD AND HONOR THE KYNG,” carved in\r\nGothic capitals. Near this also is the carved inscription, “Anno Dni\r\n1545. Monseigneir de Vernon,” and, with arms, the initials “G. V.,”\r\nand “M. V.” The remainder of this fine old heraldic frieze contains\r\na large number of shields bearing the arms of the Vernons and of\r\nthe various families allied with them, interspersed with the Vernon\r\ncrest, &c. At the end of the room next the fire-place is a small,\r\nbut exquisitely beautiful, recessed or oriel window, with seats on\r\nall sides, and forming one of the most delicious little retirements\r\nimaginable—overlooking, as it does, the lawns and terraces, and the\r\nromantic grounds and winding river, of Haddon. This recess is panelled\r\nin the same elaborate heraldic and Gothic manner as the room itself,\r\nand, besides the coats of arms and crests, bears on one of its panels\r\na grotesque head of a court fool, or jester, traditionally said to\r\nhave been intended as a portrait of Will Somers, jester to the “merry\r\nmonarch” and to his predecessor; and on two others the heads of Henry\r\nVII. and his Queen, Elizabeth of York.\r\n\r\nThe ceiling of the dining-room is divided into compartments by\r\ntransverse beams, and has been elaborately painted and decorated. In\r\nthe large window will be noticed a fine old wine-cooler of bronze, and\r\nthe fire-place and fire-dogs are also very curious and interesting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Oriel Window in the Dining-room._]\r\n\r\nPassing out from the dining-room, the visitor will next ascend\r\nthe stone stairs leading up from the Banqueting-Hall to the state\r\napartments. Arriving at the top of this short staircase he will find\r\nthree doorways, that to the left opening into the long gallery, or\r\nball-room; the one to the right giving access to the drawing-room, the\r\nEarl’s room, &c.; and the third simply opening to a staircase to the\r\nleads, &c. Passing through the door to the right the visitor enters the\r\nDRAWING-ROOM, which is situated over the Dining-room just described.\r\nIt is a charming room, hung with grand old tapestry, above which is a\r\nfrieze of ornamented mouldings, in pargetting work. This frieze is of\r\nfive heights, each being decorated with a separate moulding of raised\r\nfestoons, fruits, flowers, &c.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Ante-room to the Earl’s Bed room._]\r\n\r\nTo the left, on entering, is a beautiful recessed, or bay, window, over\r\nthe similar one in the Dining-room; and from this window one of the\r\nmost beautiful views of the terrace, the foot-bridge, the river, and\r\nthe grounds, is obtained. This window recess is wainscoted in panels,\r\nwhich have originally been painted and gilt—portions of the colour and\r\ngilding still remaining; its ceiling is in the form of a large star\r\nof eight points, with intersecting segments of circles attaching the\r\ninner angles to each other, and forming a geometric pattern of great\r\nbeauty. The ceiling of the room is also richly ornamented. Above and\r\naround the fire-place the wall is wainscoted in panels, in a similar\r\nmanner to the recess. In the fire-place is one of the most curious\r\nof existing grates, the alternate upright bars of which terminate in\r\n_fleurs-de-lis_, and a pair of exquisitely beautiful fire-dogs; the\r\ntwo bosses on each being of open metal-work, of the most chaste and\r\nelaborate design and workmanship. They are of brass; and the bosses,\r\nwhich are circular, are designed in foliage and flowers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Ball-room, or Long Gallery._]\r\n\r\nIn these beautiful remains Haddon is especially rich; but the pair\r\nin this room, and the two remarkably fine enamelled bosses in the\r\nso-called “Chaplain’s Room,” are the most interesting and elegant.\r\nOpposite to the recessed window, a doorway in the tapestry opens upon\r\nthe side gallery of the “Banqueting Hall,” and so gives access to,\r\nand communication with, the apartments on the opposite side of the\r\nquadrangle.\r\n\r\nThe opposite end of the Drawing-room from the entrance doorway is\r\noccupied by a large window, of similar size to that in the Dining-room\r\nbeneath it, which overlooks the lower court-yard or quadrangle. In this\r\nroom are still preserved some pieces of ancient furniture. Near the\r\nfurther window a doorway opens into what is called\r\n\r\nThe EARL’S DRESSING-ROOM, a small but remarkably pretty apartment, hung\r\nwith tapestry, and lighted by a recessed window. This room, as shown in\r\nour engraving, immediately communicates with\r\n\r\nThe EARL’S BED-CHAMBER, so called in connection with the one just\r\ndescribed, because thus occupied by the Earls of Rutland when residing\r\nat Haddon. This room is hung with tapestry representing hunting scenes,\r\n&c. From this chamber a doorway opens into\r\n\r\nThe LADY’S DRESSING-ROOM, also hung with tapestry, and lighted with a\r\nrecessed window. From this room a doorway opens out to the top of the\r\nflight of steps already spoken of as giving access to these apartments\r\nfrom the lower court-yard. By this means access was easily obtained to\r\nthe chapel, and the lord and lady could enter or leave these apartments\r\nwithout passing through the Banqueting Hall. A small padlocked door,\r\nin the tapestry of this room, leads up a narrow flight of steps to the\r\nleads over the chapel and to the open side of the belfry tower, where\r\nthe works of the old clock may be seen.\r\n\r\nReturning through the Earl’s Bed-chamber and Dressing-room, from the\r\nfire-grate in which it is said “the celebrated Count Rumford obtained\r\nhis plan to prevent chimneys smoking,” and retracing his steps through\r\nthe Drawing-room, the visitor passes out to the landing-place of the\r\nstaircase leading up from the Banqueting Hall. From this a doorway\r\nleads up to a small rude apartment, with a fire-place, and an old\r\nchest; and also leads to the leads of the roof of the Drawing-room,\r\nEarl’s Bed-room, Long Gallery, &c.\r\n\r\nThe LONG GALLERY, or BALL-ROOM, one of the glories of fine old Haddon,\r\nis next entered by a flight of semicircular steps of solid oak, said to\r\nhave been cut from the root of a single tree that grew in the park of\r\nHaddon, the trunk and arms of which are also asserted to have furnished\r\nthe whole of the timber of the floor of the Long Gallery, or Ball-room,\r\nitself. Thus, if the story be true, the whole of the flooring of this\r\nsuperb apartment, which is 109½ feet in length, and 18 feet in width,\r\nas well as these massive steps outside the room, were obtained from one\r\nsingle oak-tree grown on the spot.\r\n\r\nAscending the STEPS, of which we give an engraving, the visitor will\r\ndo well to notice the lock and other details of the door, which are\r\nsomewhat curious. This noble apartment extends, as will be seen on\r\nreference to the engraved plan already given, nearly the entire\r\nlength of the south side of the upper court-yard—commencing near the\r\nBanqueting Hall, and, running the entire remaining length of the upper\r\ncourt-yard, is carried out into the winter garden beyond.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Steps to the Ball-room._]\r\n\r\nThis grand room is wainscoted throughout its entire dimensions with\r\noak panelling of remarkably good architectural character. The general\r\ndesign is a series of semicircular arches, alternately large and small,\r\ndivided by pilasters with foliated capitals, and surmounted by a frieze\r\nand a turreted and battlemented cornice. The pilasters, divided like\r\nthe whole design up to the frieze, are of three heights. The basement\r\nof the wainscoting, about one-eighth of its entire height, is plainly\r\npanelled, and devoid of all ornament. The second height, rising to\r\nmore than a third of the whole, is of a much more decorated character.\r\nThe pilasters are fluted, and the spaces between them filled in with\r\ngeometric designs, the narrower spaces being by far the most elaborate\r\nin their design. The third height is a series of semicircular arches,\r\nalternately wide and narrow, divided by the pilasters, the crown of\r\nthe arch of the narrower ones being on a level with the springing of\r\nthe larger ones. The whole of the arches, in which pictures formerly\r\nhung, spring from small brackets and semi-pilasters at the sides\r\nof the pilasters, and are elaborately decorated. Over each of the\r\nsmaller arches is a shield of the arms of Manners, with a crescent for\r\ndifference, and surmounted on the frieze by their crest, a peacock\r\ndisplayed, also differenced with a crescent, alternating with those\r\nof the Vernon crest, a boar’s head. The pilasters in this height are\r\ncarved in scale pattern, and are finished with capitals of foliage\r\nfilling up the spandrels of the arches. Above these is the frieze, the\r\nspaces of which are occupied respectively with the crests just named,\r\nalternating with the rose and thistle conjoined on one stem. Above this\r\nis a remarkably fine turreted and battlemented cornice, in which the\r\nloopholes, &c., are cut quite through the whole thickness of the wood.\r\n\r\nThe ceiling of this magnificent room is coved—the coving receding for\r\nthe cornice. It is covered with elaborate and exquisitely designed\r\ngeometric tracery, consisting of squares, lozenges, quatrefoils, &c.,\r\nbeautifully foliated at their points, and containing shields of arms\r\nand crests, the arms being those of Manners impaling Vernon, and the\r\ncrests those of Manners and Vernon alternately. This ceiling was\r\noriginally painted and gilt in a very rich manner, remains of the\r\ncolouring and gilding being still distinguishable, here and there,\r\nthrough the whitewash. On the walls still hang one or two pictures,\r\nwhich perhaps, however, only add to the solitariness of its appearance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Dorothy Vernon’s Door: Interior._]\r\n\r\nOn the south side of this noble apartment is a charming central\r\nrecessed window of large size, 15 feet by 12 feet—large enough, in\r\nfact, to accommodate a goodly party around the fine old central table,\r\nwhich still remains—and two smaller recessed, or bay, windows. On\r\nthe north side are two windows looking into the upper court-yard; the\r\neast end is entirely taken up by a strongly stone-mullioned window of\r\ntwenty-four lights, with a side window on each side. In the recessed\r\nwindows are the royal arms of England, and the arms of Vernon, Manners,\r\nTalbot, &c., in stained glass. Our engraving shows about one-half, in\r\nlength, of this noble room.\r\n\r\nOpposite to the central recess is a fire-place, which still holds the\r\noriginal fire-dogs rising from goats’ feet, and decorated with human\r\nheads and heads of goats. In the centre of the large window at the\r\nend will be observed a glass case, containing a cast of the head of\r\nLady Grace Manners, whose monument is in Bakewell Church. She was the\r\ndaughter of Sir Henry Pierrepoint, and wife of Sir George Manners, of\r\nHaddon, the eldest son and heir of Sir John Manners and Dorothy Vernon\r\nhis wife. Lady Grace “bore to him (her husband) four sons and five\r\ndaughters, and lived with him in holy wedlock thirty years. She caused\r\nhim to be buried with his forefathers, and then placed this monument\r\n(at Bakewell) at her own expense, as a perpetual memorial of their\r\nconjugal faith, and she joined the figure of his body with hers, having\r\nvowed their ashes and bones should be laid together.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Dorothy Vernon’s Door: Exterior._]\r\n\r\nFrom near the upper end of this Long Gallery, or Ball-room, a highly\r\nenriched doorway opens into the Ante-room, or Lord’s Parlour.\r\n\r\nThe ANTE-ROOM, now occasionally called the “Lord’s Parlour,” and, two\r\ncenturies ago, was designated the “Orange Parlour,” is a small room,\r\nhung with paintings, and having around the upper part of its walls a\r\ncornice embellished with the crests of the Vernon and Manners families.\r\nThe interest, however, attached to this apartment rests in the\r\nstrongly barred door which opens from it on to a flight of stone steps\r\nleading down to the terrace and winter-garden. This doorway, known\r\nfar and wide as DOROTHY VERNON’S DOOR, we have engraved, both as seen\r\nfrom its exterior side and its interior side, and have also given the\r\n“initial” illustration on page 221.\r\n\r\nIt is said, and no doubt with truth, that it was through this doorway\r\nand down these steps that the lovely Dorothy Vernon, one of the\r\nco-heiresses of that grand old family, passed on the night of her\r\nelopement, and that at the top of the opposite flight of steps, shown\r\nin our ground plan, and known as “Dorothy Vernon’s Steps,” she was\r\nreceived into the arms of her ardent and true lover, John Manners,\r\nwho had horses in waiting; and that they flew through the woods and\r\nfields until they gained the high road, and made their way into the\r\nneighbouring county. It was through this doorway then that not only the\r\nlovely Dorothy passed, but with her the fine old mansion itself and all\r\nits broad lands, into the hands of the noble family now owning it.\r\n\r\nVery sweetly has the tradition of the love and elopement of this\r\nnoble pair been worked up by imagination in a story, “The Love-steps\r\nof Dorothy Vernon,” by a popular writer in the “Reliquary;” and thus\r\nanother modern author very pleasantly embodies it in verse:—\r\n\r\n  “The green old turrets, all ivy-thatch,\r\n    Above the cedars that girdle them, rise,\r\n  The pleasant glow of the sunshine catch,\r\n    And outline sharp on the bluest of skies.\r\n\r\n  “All is silent within and around;\r\n    The ghostly house and the ghostly trees\r\n  Sleep in the heat, with never a sound\r\n    Of human voices or freshening breeze.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  “It is a night with never a star,\r\n    And the Hall with revelry throbs and gleams;\r\n  There grates a hinge—the door is ajar—\r\n    And a shaft of light in the darkness streams.\r\n\r\n  “A faint sweet face, a glimmering gem,\r\n    And then two figures steal into light;\r\n  A flash, and darkness has swallowed them—\r\n    So sudden is Dorothy Vernon’s flight!”\r\n\r\nPassing through the Ante-room, the visitor next enters the STATE\r\nBED-ROOM, known two hundred years ago, it seems, as the “Blue\r\nDrawing-room.” The walls are hung with Gobelins tapestry, the subjects\r\nbeing illustrations of Æsop’s Fables; and above this is a frieze,\r\nsimilar to that in the Ante-room, bearing the crests of Vernon and\r\nManners. This apartment is lighted by a large bay-window, overlooking\r\nthe upper court-yard, and raised a couple of steps above the level\r\nof the floor of the room itself. In this window stands an antique\r\ndressing-table and a grand old looking-glass, which are worthy of the\r\nmost careful examination. Over the chimney-piece is a fine example of\r\npargetting, representing Orpheus, by his musical powers, charming the\r\nbrute creation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The State Bed-room._]\r\n\r\nThe STATE BED, shown in our engraving, measures 14 feet 6 inches\r\nin height. It is furnished in green silk velvet and white satin,\r\nexquisitely embroidered and enriched with needlework. It is one of the\r\nfinest remaining beds in existence, and is presumed to be the work\r\nof Eleanor, daughter of Thomas, and eldest sister and co-heiress of\r\nEdmund, Lord Roos, of Hamlake, and wife of Sir Robert Manners; which\r\nlady died in 1487. According to traditional report, it was removed\r\nmany years ago from Haddon to Belvoir Castle, and afterwards restored\r\nto Haddon. The last person who ever slept in it is said to have been\r\nGeorge IV., when Prince Regent; he occupied it during his visit to\r\nBelvoir Castle.\r\n\r\nFrom the State Bed-room a doorway behind the tapestry opens upon a\r\nshort flight of stone steps, leading to what is usually called the\r\nANCIENT STATE ROOM, or PAGE’S ROOM, and which two centuries ago was\r\ncalled the “Best Lodging-room.”\r\n\r\nThis apartment, like the previous one, is hung with Gobelins tapestry,\r\nthe subjects being illustrations of some of the events in the life of\r\nMoses. The thickness of the walls, the small size of the windows, and\r\nthe lowness of these rooms, show that they belong to the more ancient\r\npart of the building.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Archers’ Room—for Stringing Bows, &c._]\r\n\r\nFrom the Page’s Room a short flight of steps leads into a passage,\r\nor small room, which may appropriately be called the ARCHERS’ ROOM\r\nand is shown in our engraving, where the visitor will notice a\r\nremarkable WOODEN FRAME for the stringing of bows and cross-bows—the\r\nonly one probably which he will ever see preserved. It forms one of\r\nour illustrations. The passage leads by a few stone steps into a\r\nrude apartment, probably a guard-room, where, behind the rafters,\r\ninnumerable bats now build their nests; also into the cross-bow\r\nroom, where the bows were hung; and into several other old and\r\ncheerless-looking rooms; also to a spiral stone staircase, which,\r\nspringing from the gateway under the PEVEREL TOWER, leads by seventy\r\nsteps, some so worn that they have been covered by wooden ones, to the\r\ntop of the tower, the ascent of which will amply repay the visitor for\r\nhis trouble by the grand and interestingly beautiful view he obtains\r\nof the mansion and the neighbourhood. Of the turret on the PEVEREL, or\r\nEAGLE TOWER, we give an engraving.\r\n\r\nHaving descended the tower, the visitor returns through the State\r\nBed-room into the Ante-room, and is here usually dismissed into the\r\ngrounds, through “Dorothy Vernon’s Door.” As we have not, however,\r\ninitiated _our_ tourist into the mysteries of all the rooms and\r\npassages of this noble pile of building, we will not dismiss _him_\r\nin this summary manner, but bring him back into the Banqueting Hall,\r\nwhence we will show him the kitchens and suite of rooms on the\r\nnorth side, and then conduct him to the grounds and to some of the\r\ninteresting places in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Rack for Stringing the Bows._]\r\n\r\nThe KITCHEN and range of domestic offices at Haddon are very large\r\nand extensive, and show, more strikingly than any description, the\r\nmarvellous amount of cooking that must have been carried on, and the\r\nmore than princely hospitality observed by its owners in its palmy days.\r\n\r\nThe four doorways, already spoken of as existing in the wall of the\r\npassage opposite to the screen of the Banqueting-Hall, and beneath the\r\nMinstrels’ Gallery, have all of them pointed arches. The first of these\r\ndoorways, on entering from the lower court-yard, or quadrangle, yet\r\nretains its old oaken door. This room was the _buttery_, and the door\r\nstill has perfect its buttery-hatch in the middle. This is a small\r\nopening, with a little wicket to close and fit, just large enough to\r\npass out a trencher of provisions to the servants or retainers, or as\r\nalms to wayfarers. From this room a flight of stone steps conducts to\r\nthe vaulted cellars, and it also communicates with the storerooms and\r\nother offices, &c.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Eagle, or Peverel Tower._]\r\n\r\nThe second doorway, which is open, leads down a long passage to the\r\nGREAT KITCHEN. At the end, the passage terminates in a strong and\r\nmassive half-door, the top of which is formed into a broad shelf. To\r\nthis point only were the servants permitted to come, but were forbidden\r\naccess to the kitchen itself. The dishes were placed on the door-shelf\r\nby the cooks on the one side, and removed by the servitors on the\r\nother, and by them carried up the passage into the Banqueting-Hall.\r\nThe kitchen is of immense size, its ceiling supported by massive\r\nbeams and by a central support of solid oak. It contains two enormous\r\nfire-places, stoves for various purposes, and spits, pot-hooks, and\r\ntenter-hooks by the score; enormous chopping-blocks, dressers of all\r\nsorts and sizes, tables of solid oak, six or seven inches in thickness,\r\nand hollowed into circular chopping-troughs—one of which is worn\r\nthrough by constant use—and every possible appliance for keeping open\r\nhouse in the most lavish style. Adjoining the kitchen are a number of\r\nrooms, bakehouse, larders, pantries, salting-rooms, &c., all fitted in\r\nthe same marvellously massive manner. In one of these should be noticed\r\nan enormous salting-trough, hollowed out of one immense block of wood,\r\nwithout joint or fastening. This is among the most wonderful relics of\r\nthe place, and ought to claim attention from the visitor.\r\n\r\nThe third doorway opens into what is conjectured to have been the\r\nwine-cellar—a vaulted room well adapted for the purpose, and close at\r\nhand for the Banqueting Hall.\r\n\r\nThe fourth doorway opens at the foot of a flight of stairs leading\r\nup to the apartments on the north side, which, for more than half\r\nits length, contains a second as well as a first floor. These rooms\r\nare many in number, and curiously labyrinthine in construction, and\r\nalthough not possessing attraction enough to be shown to the general\r\nvisitor, are nevertheless among the most interesting in the mansion.\r\nSome of them are hung with tapestry which ranks among the best in the\r\nhouse: one room especially, where groups of children gathering fruit\r\nare depicted, is peculiarly beautiful. In two of the apartments on this\r\nside are charming little closets, on the tapestry of one of which the\r\nroyal arms are depicted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gallery across Small Yard._]\r\n\r\nOne of these tapestried rooms is named in an old list of apartments\r\nof 1666 as “Lady Dorothy’s Chamber,” and a neighbouring apartment\r\nis called “Lady Cranborne’s Chamber.” A third tapestried apartment\r\nwas called “Roger Manners’ Room.” All these rooms are on the central\r\nportion of the northern side of the Hall, over the kitchen and\r\nadjoining rooms. The apartment over the buttery was the “Great Nursery.”\r\n\r\nMost of the rooms on this side of the building have evidently been\r\nintended for sleeping apartments; and there is a staircase with\r\nornamental rails, on which remains of the original gilding still serve\r\nas a relief to the sombre colour of the oak.\r\n\r\nOne of the most charming “bits” on this side is a short WOODEN GALLERY,\r\nhere engraved, with oak balustrades, which leads across a tiny little\r\nopen court from one of the tapestried apartments to another, and on\r\nthe walls of which mosses and lichens grow in luxuriance. It is just\r\nthe spot, opening from the heated rooms, for a lounge in the pure\r\nair; and no doubt from this gallery Dorothy Vernon, and many another\r\nhigh-bred dame, has looked up to the stars overhead while passing from\r\nroom to room, on a festive night, as well as on many a quiet evening.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Room over the Entrance Gateway._]\r\n\r\nAmong the apartments not usually shown are also two handsome wainscoted\r\nrooms, with carved ceilings, situated over each other, in the entrance\r\ngateway tower. Above the uppermost of these is a room supposed to have\r\nbeen a place of confinement, because there are traces of _external_\r\nbolts and bars. It has two windows, in one of which are two massive\r\nstone seats inserted in the wall. It has also a door leading out to the\r\nleads.\r\n\r\nMost of the points of interest have now been described; but the curious\r\nrambler, who may choose to linger and pry into nooks and corners, will\r\ndo well to visit some of the basement rooms—as that on the left-hand\r\nside under the Eagle or Peverel Tower—an arched warder’s room, where\r\nhe will note the thickness of the walls (7 feet); the next room\r\nwestward, which seems to have been the earlier kitchen and bakehouse;\r\nthe room under the State Bed-room, used in later times as a gymnasium\r\nfor the family; the Armoury, which is under that portion of the Long\r\nGallery with the deep projecting recess; and the rooms under the Long\r\nGallery nearer the Dining-room, where the splay of the windows is\r\nnearly 9 feet, and which seem to have been used as washing-houses. Also\r\nthe so-called Aviary, which opens toward the garden, under the Earl’s\r\nBed-room and adjoining rooms; and of the rooms yet unmentioned on the\r\nwest side of the lower courts, suffice it to say, that on the ground\r\nfloor, next to the so-called Chaplain’s Room, were two waiting-rooms;\r\nand then the Steward’s Room, next to the chapel entrance; over this\r\nentrance the Steward’s Bed-room, approached by a spiral staircase near\r\nthe belfry tower from a closet in which access is gained to the leads;\r\nand after passing the clerestory windows of the chapel, there is an\r\nangle commanding a good view of the lower court. Then on this first\r\nfloor are a bed-room, the “Barmaster’s Room;” the real Chaplain’s Room,\r\nin which is now a collection of bones; a small room still used by the\r\nduke for private papers; and another bed-room, which brings us back to\r\nthe entrance gateway.\r\n\r\nBut enough has been said of the interior of Haddon to satisfy the\r\nwants of the tourist, and, although we could linger for hours over the\r\nvarious rooms not yet specifically described, and fill several chapters\r\nwith their description, we must reluctantly leave them, and pass on\r\ninto the grounds, and so make our way to Bakewell, to show the visitor\r\nthe last resting-places of the noble families to whom Haddon has\r\nbelonged.\r\n\r\nLeaving, then, by a small doorway at the end of a passage leading out\r\nfrom the Banqueting-Hall, and passing the Dining-room on the right, the\r\nvisitor will enter what is called the “Upper Garden.” To his right he\r\nwill see below him, on looking over the strongly-buttressed wall—one\r\nof the oldest parts of the building—the “Lower Garden,” roughly\r\nterraced down the hill side, and to his right a gravelled path leads by\r\nthe side of the building to the wall of the chapel, where, by a long\r\nflight of sixty-seven steps, it descends to the old foot-bridge—one of\r\nthe prettiest objects in the grounds: this we have engraved.\r\n\r\nTo his left, the “Upper Garden,” 120 feet square, is a lawn; up its\r\ncentre, as well as around it, runs a broad gravel walk, opposite\r\nto which rises a splendid wide flight of stone steps, with stone\r\nbalustrades, leading to the TERRACE and WINTER GARDEN. Along the sides\r\nof this garden are beds partitioned off by hedges, or as they may more\r\nappropriately be called, walls of yew and box.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Terrace._]\r\n\r\nThe TERRACE, one of the glories of Haddon, extends the full width of\r\nthe Upper Garden, the balustraded wall running flush with the end\r\nof the Long Gallery. From this terrace the finest view of the south\r\nfront of Haddon is obtained, and it is indeed a view to revel in, and\r\nnot to be forgotten. The WINTER GARDEN of the terrace is planted with\r\nyew-trees, many centuries old, whose gnarled and knotted roots may be\r\nseen curiously intertwining and displacing the stone edgings of the\r\nparterres. It is altogether one of the most charming outdoor “bits”\r\nwhich even the most romantic and vivid imagination can conceive.\r\n\r\nAt the north end of the Winter Garden of Haddon Hall, in that\r\ncharmingly shady corner formed by the wall of the Long Gallery on the\r\none side, the outer wall of the garden on the opposite, and overhung\r\nwith a grand melancholy-looking yew-tree, which casts a sombre and\r\neven gloomy shadow across it, is that most attractive feature of the\r\nmansion, “Dorothy Vernon’s Door,” previously spoken of as opening out\r\nof the Ante-room.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Hall from the Terrace._]\r\n\r\nFrom the interior, by the way of Dorothy Vernon’s Door, a short flight\r\nof stone steps, with balustrated sides, leads down to the Winter\r\nGarden, on the opposite side of which, nearly opposite to this doorway,\r\na long flight of stone steps leads up to another, and considerably\r\nhigher terrace, called DOROTHY VERNON’S WALK—a broad pathway, or\r\npromenade, passing between an avenue of lofty lime and sycamore\r\ntrees—and one of the most secluded and romantic “lovers’ walks” in the\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThe old BOWLING GREEN, near the summit of the hill above Haddon,\r\noccupied an acre of ground, and was approached by an avenue of trees.\r\nIt was enclosed by a thick hedge of yew, with a flight of stone steps\r\nfor an entrance. On one side was a lodge, or summer-house, over one of\r\nthe doorways of which are initials and the date of 1696. The “Green”\r\nis now converted into a garden. The old kitchen-garden, years ago taken\r\naway, was situated near the foot-bridge.\r\n\r\nThere is also a plot of ground, levelled, and in form a parallelogram,\r\nwhich is known as the “Archery Ground.”\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Haddon, the visitor should step inside the building\r\nnow used as a stable, in which he will find some features worthy of\r\nobservation. In the cottage inhabited by the kindly and respected\r\ncustodian of Haddon, is some fine carved furniture, and in the garden\r\nin front, the yew trees, cut into the form of a peacock and a boar’s\r\nhead—the crests of Manners and of Vernon—form pleasing objects, and\r\nare sure to attract the attention of the visitor.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMANY other interesting particulars regarding this grand old mansion\r\nmight be given, but we now proceed to speak of the family of its\r\npresent noble owner, the Duke of Rutland, in the same way as we have\r\nalready done of its former possessors, the Avenells and Vernons.\r\n\r\nThe noble family of Manners, like that of Vernon, is of considerable\r\nantiquity; and, although the records of its early members do not extend\r\nso far back as those of the Vernons, its history is more illustrious,\r\nand its dignities are more exalted. The most ancient of the ancestors\r\nof the present Duke of Rutland, of whom there is direct evidence, was\r\nSir Robert Manners, Lord of the Manor of Ethale, in Northumberland,\r\nfrom whom descended another Sir Robert, who married Philippa, daughter\r\nof St. Bartholomew de Mont Bouchier, by whom he had issue, a son,\r\nalso named Robert, who married Hawise, daughter of Robert, Baron de\r\nMuschamp, in the reign of Henry I. Their great-grandson, another Sir\r\nRobert Manners, married Agnes, daughter of Sir David Coupland. Their\r\nson, Sir Robert, had issue by his wife, Joan de Heton, four sons; three\r\nof whom dying without issue, the second son, William Manners, inherited\r\nthe estates. He married Ellen, or Janetta, daughter of David Baxter, of\r\nDerby, by whom he had a son, Sir Robert Manners.\r\n\r\nThis Sir Robert was returned in the seventeenth year of Edward III.,\r\nas one of the principal persons in the county of Northumberland, and\r\nwas entitled to bear arms by descent. In the first year of Edward’s\r\nreign, being governor of Norham Castle, he distinguished himself by\r\nhis successful defence of that stronghold against the Scots, who\r\n“despising King Edward’s youth, on the very night of that day on\r\nwhich King Edward was crowned, intended to take Norham Castle by\r\nsurprise; and so well managed their design, that about sixteen of them\r\nhad already mounted the walls. But the captain, Sir Robert Manners,\r\nbeing warned of the matter beforehand, by one of his garrison, who\r\nwas a Scotsman, had so well prepared to receive them, that of those\r\nwho had mounted he took five or six, and put the rest to the sword,\r\ntheir companions below, upon this disappointment, retiring.” In the\r\nnext year he was constituted one of the “conservators of the truce\r\nmade with the Scots for all hostilities to cease.” Soon afterwards he\r\nwas made Sheriff of the county of Selkirk, and appointed to keep and\r\ndefend the forts of Selkirk, and Ettrick, &c. In the fourteenth of\r\nthe same reign he represented Northumberland in Parliament, and again\r\nsubdued Scotch incursions. Soon afterwards he obtained a licence from\r\nthe king “to strengthen and embattle his dwelling-house at Ethale,\r\nin Northumberland, with a wall made of stone and lime, and to hold\r\nthe same to himself and his heirs for ever.” The next year he was\r\nconstituted one of the Commissioners to treat with David Bruce and his\r\nadherents for a peace, and subsequently was made Lord of the Marches.\r\nAt the battle of Neville’s Cross, in 1346, under Queen Philippa, in\r\nwhich the Scottish king was taken prisoner, Sir Robert displayed\r\ngreat valour, and was entrusted to keep charge of the prisoners, and\r\ndeliver them to the Constable at the Tower of London. He died in 1355,\r\nleaving his son and heir, John de Manners (by his wife Aliva, or Alice,\r\ndaughter of Henry Strather), only one year and three weeks old.\r\n\r\nThis John Manners received the honour of knighthood, and married Alice,\r\nwidow of William de Whitchester; and, dying in 1402, was succeeded by\r\nhis son, Sir John Manners, who was Sheriff of Northumberland, and, with\r\nhis son John, was accused of the murder of William Heron and Robert\r\nAtkinson or Akyman; they were prosecuted by Sir Robert de Umphreville,\r\nand Isabel, widow of William Heron, and were ordered to “cause 500\r\nmasses to be sung for the health of the soul of the same William\r\nHeron within one year then next ensuing, and pay unto Sir Robert de\r\nUmphreville, and Isabel, to the use of the said Isabel and her children\r\nby Heron, 200 marks.” He was succeeded by his son Robert, who married\r\nJoan, daughter of Sir Robert Ogle, and had issue by her, with others, a\r\nson, Robert, by whom he was succeeded. This Sir Robert Manners married\r\nEleanor, daughter of Thomas, Lord Roos (by Philippa his wife, daughter\r\nof John, Lord Tiptoft, Earl of Worcester), and sister and co-heiress of\r\nEdmund Lord Roos, “whereby he greatly increased his estate, and among\r\nother possessions, had the ancient seat of Belvoir Castle, built by\r\nRobert de Todenei, a noble Norman, on a stately ascent, overlooking the\r\nbeautiful valley adjacent (thence by him called _Belvoir_, from the\r\nfair view of the country thereabouts), and it became the chief seat of\r\nthat great barony, bestowed on him by William the Conqueror; which seat\r\nand barony, in the reign of Henry III., devolved upon Robert de Roos,\r\na great baron, by marriage with Isabel, daughter and heir of William\r\nde Albini, the fourth of that name, descended from the said Robert de\r\nTodenei; and from the Lord Roos it came to Sir Robert Manners by his\r\nmarriage,” as did also many other estates in other counties. The issue\r\nof this marriage was three daughters, who each married into the family\r\nof Fairfax, and two sons. The eldest of these sons was Sir George\r\nManners, who, on the death of his mother, became Lord Roos, and was\r\nalso lineal heir to the baronies of Riveaulx, Trusbut, and Belvoir. He\r\nmarried Anne, only daughter and heiress of Sir Thomas St. Leger, by his\r\nwife Anne, daughter of Richard, Duke of York, and sister to King Edward\r\nIV., and widow of John Holland, Duke of Exeter. By this lady, who\r\nbrought royal blood into the family, Sir George had a numerous family,\r\nthe eldest of whom succeeded him.\r\n\r\nThat was Sir Thomas Manners, who, on the death of his father, became\r\nthirteenth Lord Roos of Hamlake, and Baron Trusbut, Riveaulx, and\r\nBelvoir. He was with Henry VIII. and his Queen at the celebrated\r\ninterview between that monarch and the King of France at Guisnes, and\r\nin the same reign was made Warden of the East Marches, and had many\r\nother honours granted him. In the seventeenth year of the same monarch\r\nhe was created Earl of Rutland—“a title which none but the royal\r\nfamily had ever borne, and, by reason of his descent from the sister\r\nof King Edward IV., had an augmentation to his ancient arms,” _or_,\r\ntwo bars _azure_, and a chief, _gules_: which chief was augmented\r\nthus:—quarterly _azure_ and _gules_:—in the first and fourth two\r\n_fleurs-de-lis_, and in the second and third a lion _passant guardant_,\r\nall _or_. He was also installed a Knight of the Garter. A few years\r\nlater this nobleman was present at the second interview between Henry\r\nVIII. and Francis I.: he was also present at the marriage of his\r\nsovereign with the ill-fated Anne Boleyn; and, later on, attended Anne\r\nof Cleves to England, and was made her chamberlain. His lordship, who,\r\nbesides the honours we have briefly indicated, took part in most of\r\nthe events of this stirring reign and held numerous important offices,\r\nmarried twice, first, Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Robert Lovel; and\r\nsecond, Eleanor, daughter of Sir William Paston, by the latter of whom\r\nonly he had issue. To the eldest and second of that issue we now refer.\r\n\r\nThe eldest son, Henry Manners, succeeded his father, in 1543, as second\r\nEarl of Rutland. He was married twice: first to Margaret, daughter of\r\nthe fourth Earl of Westmoreland, by whom he had issue; and, second, to\r\nBridget, daughter of Lord Hussey, by whom he had no children. He was\r\nsucceeded by his eldest son, Edward Manners, as third Earl of Rutland,\r\nwho, dying without male issue, was succeeded by his brother, John\r\nManners (the second son of the second Earl), as fourth Earl of Rutland.\r\nThis nobleman married Elizabeth, daughter of Francis Charlton of\r\nApsley, by whom he had issue, with others, three sons—Roger Manners,\r\nSir Francis Manners, and Sir George Manners—who successively became\r\nfifth, six, and seventh Earls of Rutland. All these dying without\r\nsurviving male issue, the title passed to the descendants of the second\r\nson of the first Earl.\r\n\r\nSir John Manners, second son of the first Earl of Rutland, and who was\r\nconsequently great grandson of the sister of King Edward IV., is the\r\none member of this illustrious family with whom Haddon is especially\r\nconnected. This John Manners, before he was knighted, became attached\r\nto Dorothy Vernon, the youngest daughter and co-heiress of Sir George\r\nVernon of Haddon Hall, known far and wide as “the King of the Peak.”\r\nDisguised, as we have already related, as a forester or woodman, John\r\nManners for some time lived in the woods about Haddon, in the hope of\r\nobtaining occasional glimpses of, and stolen interviews with, Dorothy\r\nVernon; and at length so wooed that he won her, and carried her off on\r\nhorseback into his own county of Leicester, and there married her. The\r\nstory of this romantic elopement is one of the pleasantest episodes\r\nin the history of Haddon, and will have again to be alluded to later\r\non. By that marriage the grand old mansion of Haddon Hall, and the\r\nDerbyshire property of the “King of the Peak,” passed into the family\r\nof Manners, and helped to swell its already large rent-roll of estates.\r\n\r\nThis John Manners, who was knighted in 1603, had issue by his wife,\r\nDorothy Vernon, three sons: Sir George Manners who succeeded him; John\r\nManners, who died at the age of fourteen years; Sir Roger Manners, of\r\nWhitwell; and Grace Manners, who married Sir Francis Fortescue, of\r\nSalden. He died June 4th, 1611; his wife died in 1584.\r\n\r\nSir George Manners, their son, married Grace, daughter of Sir Henry\r\nPierrepoint, and sister to the Earl of Kingston, by whom he had issue,\r\nwith others, John Manners, his eldest son, who not only succeeded him,\r\nbut also succeeded his own cousin George, seventh Earl of Rutland,\r\nin his title and estates, and thus became eighth Earl of Rutland. He\r\nmarried Frances, daughter of Edward, Lord Montague of Boughton, by whom\r\nhe had issue four sons and seven daughters.\r\n\r\nHe was Sheriff of Derbyshire in the ninth and eleventh years of Charles\r\nI., and also represented that county in Parliament. His lordship was\r\nattached to the Parliamentary interest during the Civil Wars, and was\r\none of the twenty-two peers who remained at Westminster when the king\r\nsummoned both houses to attend him at Oxford. As a consequence, his\r\ncastle of Belvoir was seized by the Royalists, and was held by them\r\nand Sir Gervase Lucas, and here the king frequently resided; it was\r\nfinally surrendered to the Parliamentarians in January, 1645-6. In 1649\r\nthe castle was demolished, by consent of the earl, who soon afterwards\r\nset about rebuilding it, which he completed in 1668. During this time\r\nthe earl lived principally at Haddon Hall, where he died in 1679. Here\r\nhe lived in a style of almost princely magnificence, maintaining a\r\nlarge number of servants and retainers, and dispensing, especially at\r\nChristmas time, his hospitality with a lavish hand.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, from 1660 to 1670, although the family only\r\noccasionally resided here, there were generally killed and consumed\r\nevery year at Haddon between thirty and forty beeves, from four to five\r\nhundred sheep, and a number of swine, so that there was no lack of the\r\ngood things of this world for visitors to this hospitable place.\r\n\r\nThis nobleman was succeeded by his third and only surviving son, John\r\nManners, as ninth Earl of Rutland. This nobleman was born in 1638, and,\r\nin 1679, was created a peer in his own right by the title of Baron\r\nManners of Haddon; and in September of the same year, his father dying,\r\nhe became Earl of Rutland. When twenty years of age he had married the\r\nLady Anne Pierrepoint, daughter of the Marquis of Dorchester, from whom\r\nhe was afterwards divorced; and married, secondly, Lady Diana Bruce,\r\nwidow of Sir Seymour Shirley, and daughter of the Earl of Aylesbury,\r\nwho died in child-bed. His lordship married, thirdly, Catherine,\r\ndaughter of Baptist Noel, Viscount Campden, by whom only he had\r\nsurviving issue. He lived a country life, and “kept up his old mansion\r\nat a bountiful old rate,” and in a style of even greater magnificence\r\nand open-handedness than his father. It is said that at Haddon alone\r\nhe kept seven score of servants, and that every day saw his grand old\r\nbanqueting-hall filled to overflowing with retainers and guests. In\r\n1703 the Earl was raised to the highest dignity in the realm, by the\r\ntitles of Marquis of Granby and Duke of Rutland. He died in January,\r\n1710-11, aged seventy-three, and was succeeded by his only surviving\r\nson, John Manners.\r\n\r\nJohn, second Duke of Rutland, when scarcely seventeen years of age,\r\nwas married to Katherine, second daughter of Lord William Russell,\r\nwho was beheaded in 1683. He then bore the title of Lord Roos; and\r\nthe wedding festivities seem, judging from some curious letters still\r\nextant concerning them, to have been of the most lavishly extravagant\r\ncharacter. This lady who was sister to the Duchess of Devonshire and to\r\nthe Duke of Bedford, gave birth to five sons and four daughters, and\r\ndied in child-bed, in 1711. The Duke married, secondly, Lucy, daughter\r\nof Lord Sherard, and sister of the Earl of Harborough, by whom also he\r\nhad issue, six sons and two daughters: his grace died in 1721, and was\r\nsucceeded, as third Duke of Rutland, by his eldest son, John Manners.\r\nThis nobleman, who was born in 1696, married, in 1717, Bridget, only\r\ndaughter and heiress of Lord Lexington (an alliance that gave him a\r\nlarge accession of estates), by whom he had issue thirteen children,\r\nnearly all of whom died young.\r\n\r\nHe was the last of the family who made Haddon Hall a residence.\r\n\r\nThe estates of Lord Lexington having been settled upon the younger\r\nbranch of the family, the second and surviving sons, successively,\r\ntook, by Act of Parliament, the additional surname of Sutton, and thus\r\nfounded the family of Manners-Sutton.\r\n\r\nThe Duke, who was familiarly known as “the old man of the hill,” dying\r\nin 1779, was succeeded by his grandson, Charles Manners, son of the\r\ncelebrated Marquis of Granby, Commander-in-chief of the British forces\r\nin Germany, and Master of the Ordnance, who died during his father’s\r\nlifetime. Charles, fourth Duke of Rutland, married Mary Isabella,\r\ndaughter of Charles Noel, Duke of Beaufort, by whom he had issue four\r\nsons—viz., John Henry, who succeeded him, Charles Henry Somerset,\r\nRobert William, and William Robert Albini; and two daughters—viz.,\r\nthe Lady Elizabeth Isabella, married to Richard Norman, Esq., and\r\nLady Catherine Mary, married to Lord Forester. His grace died while\r\nholding office as Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, and was succeeded by his\r\neldest son—John Henry Manners, as fifth Duke of Rutland, who married\r\nElizabeth, daughter of the Earl of Carlisle, and by her had issue,\r\namong others, his grace the present Duke of Rutland (third son, the two\r\nelder ones having died before their father), and Lord John Manners,\r\nM.P. His grace died in 1857, aged seventy-nine.\r\n\r\nThe present peer, Charles Cecil Manners, sixth Duke of Rutland, Marquis\r\nof Granby, Earl of Rutland, and Baron Manners of Haddon, &c., &c., was\r\nborn in 1815, and has held many important appointments. His grace is\r\nnot married: the heir to the title and estates being his brother, Lord\r\nJohn Robert Manners (Marquis of Granby, by courtesy), M.P. for North\r\nLeicestershire, who is also known for the official posts he has held in\r\nthe government of this country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe arms of the Duke of Rutland are, _or_, two bars, _azure_; augmented\r\nby a chief, quarterly, first and fourth _azure_, two _fleurs-de-lis_,\r\n_or_ (France), second and third _gules_, a lion _passant-guardant_,\r\n_or_ (England). Crest, on a _chapeau_, _gules_, turned up, _ermine_, a\r\npeacock in pride, proper. Supporters, two unicorns, _argent_, horns,\r\nmanes, tufts, and hoofs, _or_. Motto, “Pour y parvenir.”\r\n\r\nThe meadows around Haddon—with the river Wye twisting and turning\r\nabout in all imaginable forms—are very delightful, and some of the\r\npleasantest strolls conceivable may be taken along them, both up and\r\ndown the stream, which is full of fine trout, and is, therefore, a\r\nsource of endless delight to the angler.\r\n\r\nHaving thus given our readers as full an account as would appear\r\nnecessary both of the noble families to whom Haddon has belonged,\r\nand of the Hall itself, and told them as much of its history as is\r\nrequisite for our purpose, we take leave of this interesting pile, and\r\nproceed to speak of one or two matters connected with its immediate\r\nneighbourhood, before passing on to the fine old church at Bakewell,\r\nwhere lie interred so many of the families of Vernon and Manners.\r\n\r\nHaddon has been a prolific theme for writers, and an endless source of\r\ninspiration for poets and artists, and long will it continue to be so,\r\nfor no “olden” place can be more picturesque or more romantic. It is\r\nsaid that Mrs. Radcliffe was so struck with it, that she laid the scene\r\nof her “Mysteries of Udolpho” here; and Allan Cunningham, the Countess\r\nde Carabrella, and numberless other writers, have made it a theme for\r\nsome of their pleasantest productions; William Bennett took it and\r\nits hospitable owner, Sir George Vernon, as the subject of one of his\r\nmost successful novels, “The King of the Peak;” while D. Cox, Nash,\r\nCattermole, Harding, Rayner, Morrison, and a host of other artists,\r\nhave added to their reputations by painting some of its more attractive\r\nfeatures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Foot-Bridge._]\r\n\r\nAs may naturally be expected, in a neighbourhood so rich in interest\r\nas that of Haddon, some singular discoveries have at one time or other\r\nbeen made. Among these the Roman altar, described on a preceding page,\r\nis perhaps the most important.\r\n\r\nThe opening of barrows in the neighbourhood has brought to light\r\nmany interesting remains of the ancient British period, and also of\r\nRomano-British times. These consist of interments in which have been\r\nfound cinerary urns, drinking-cups, bone mesh-rules, flint implements,\r\nbronze celts, and other articles.\r\n\r\nSome fine antlers, and parts of antlers, of the red deer, one of which,\r\nwith four points at the top, measured more than three feet along its\r\nouter curve, and was six-and-a-half inches in medium circumference,\r\nhave also been found. But these are not the only remains of extinct\r\nanimals found in the neighbourhood, for those of the wild dog, the wild\r\nhog, the horse, the deer, the roebuck, and the ox—both the _Bos urus_\r\nand the _Bos longifrons_—all of which once ran wild in Derbyshire,\r\nhave been found, in the course of deep draining near the Hall, and\r\npreserved under the careful direction of Mr. Nesfield.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Ring found at Haddon Hall._]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most elegant relic yet discovered is the ring shown\r\nin our engraving, which is in possession of his Grace the Duke of\r\nRutland. It was found a few years ago, not far from the “Bowling\r\nGreen,” and is evidently of the fifteenth century, and is of extremely\r\nfine workmanship and elegant design. The hoop is wreathed, and\r\nhas originally been enamelled, and bears between the foliage the\r\ninscription, in old English letters, “de boen cuer,” which is one\r\nof frequent occurrence as a posy upon mediæval rings, probably in\r\nthis case, meaning _de bon cœur_, and showing the hearty affection\r\nof the giver to the receiver. The little figure engraved on the\r\nbesel is St. John the Baptist, with the Lamb enfolded in his mantle,\r\nand has most likely also been enamelled. It is probably a kind of\r\ncharm-ring—_i.e._, a ring possessing physical or phylacteric qualities\r\nagainst epilepsy, the _mal de St. Jean_. It is of the purest gold, and\r\nweighs ninety-seven grains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Washing-Tally found at Haddon Hall._]\r\n\r\nAnother interesting “find” was the Washing-Tally already referred\r\nto, which is of the time of Charles I, and of extreme rarity. Of\r\nthis tally, as intimately connected with the inner and home life of\r\nHaddon, at the period of the height of its hospitality and glory,\r\nwe give the accompanying accurate engraving, which is drawn of a\r\nsomewhat reduced size, and for which, as for the ring, and other\r\nengravings, our readers are indebted to the _Reliquary Archæological\r\nJournal_, edited by Llewellynn Jewitt, F.S.A. This very interesting\r\nrelic is five-and-a-half inches in length and four-and-a-half inches\r\nin depth. It is formed of a piece of beech-wood, a quarter of an\r\ninch in thickness, covered with linen on the back and sides. Its\r\nconstruction is precisely that of a “horn-book.” In front, the names\r\nof the different articles of clothing are printed from a copper plate\r\nand protected by a sheet of horn. Around the edge, a narrow slip of\r\nthin brass, fastened down with highly ornamented nails, attaches the\r\nhorn, the paper, and the linen, to the wood. The “tally” is divided\r\ninto fifteen squares, in each of which is a dial numbered from 0 to 12,\r\nand above each square is the name of the article of clothing intended\r\nto be taken into account. These are “Ruffes,” “Bandes,” “Cuffes,”\r\n“Handkercher,” “Capps,” “Shirtes,” “Half-Shirtes,” “Boote-hose,”\r\n“Topps,” “Sockes,” “Sheetes,” “Pillowberes,” “Tableclothes,”\r\n“Napkins,” and “Towells.” On each of the dials is a circular brass\r\nindicator, fastened by a little pin in its centre, so as to be turned\r\nround at pleasure. Each indicator is pierced on one side, close to the\r\nedge, with a round hole through which one number only on the dial is\r\nvisible at a time, and opposite to this hole is a raised point by which\r\nthe indicator can be turned as required.\r\n\r\nIt may here be well to note, that although Haddon Hall is no longer\r\nused as a residence by the Duke of Rutland, he has within three or four\r\nmiles of it a delightful shooting-box, Stanton Woodhouse, pleasantly\r\nsituated and charming in every respect, where he and others of his\r\nfamily occasionally sojourn. This and his other shooting-lodge,\r\nLongshawe, some distance across the moors of the same county, are two\r\ncharming retreats for the sportsman. It may be mentioned, too, that at\r\nRowsley, close at hand, is the admirably executed effigy of Lady John\r\nManners and her infant, by W. C. Marshall, R.A.\r\n\r\nPassing on from Haddon to Bakewell, the tourist will not fail to notice\r\nthe Dove-cote on a mound near the road-side, and from this road-side he\r\nwill obtain one of the best and most charming views of the Hall to be\r\ngained from any point.\r\n\r\nBAKEWELL CHURCH, the burial-place of some of the members of the Vernon\r\nand Manners families, to whom Haddon Hall successively belonged, is\r\nnearly two miles distant from Haddon, and may be seen on looking up\r\nthe valley of the Wye. Bakewell itself is a pleasant and remarkably\r\nclean little market-town, built on the banks of the Wye; there are\r\nseveral good public buildings in the town itself, and many substantial\r\nresidences in its neighbourhood. It is, however, to the church only\r\nthat we now desire to call attention in a short description.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Bakewell Church._]\r\n\r\nIt is a cruciform building, of about 150 feet in length from west to\r\neast, and about 105 feet in width across from wall to wall of the north\r\nand south transepts, with a central tower and spire. It contains some\r\nextremely fine Norman and Early-English features, and is lofty and\r\nremarkably well proportioned. In the centre rises a noble tower, the\r\nlower part of which is square, and the upper octagonal, with the angles\r\nboldly chamfered, and this is surmounted by a lofty spire. There can\r\nbe no doubt, from remains which have been found, that a church had\r\nexisted on this spot from very early pre-Norman times. In Domesday\r\nsurvey, it is stated there were two priests for the church of Bakewell.\r\nIt was afterwards made a collegiate church. It was granted by William\r\nthe Conqueror to William Peverel, his natural son, but was, with the\r\nother immense possessions of that family, forfeited by attainder by\r\none of his descendants in 1154; it remained in the possession of the\r\ncrown till it was given by Richard I., on his accession to the throne\r\nin 1189, to his brother John, Earl of Morteigne, afterwards King John.\r\nTo him is traditionally ascribed the rebuilding of the nave (with the\r\nexception of the west end, which he is said to have left standing),\r\nand its endowment; but it is more probable that it was built and\r\nendowed by a Peverel, who gave part of the Bakewell tithes to Lenton\r\nPriory. In 1192, Earl John gave the church, with all its prebends and\r\nother appurtenances, to the present cathedral of Lichfield. In 1365, a\r\nchantry was founded in the church by Sir Godfrey Foljambe and Avena\r\nhis wife, whose beautiful little monument will be seen on one of the\r\npiers of the nave. The nave, which was erected probably about 1110,\r\nis separated from the side-aisles by semicircular arches, rising\r\nfrom piers of solid masonry instead of pillars. At the west end is\r\na fine Norman doorway ornamented with beak-head mouldings and other\r\ncharacteristic features.\r\n\r\nThe church was extensively repaired and restored in 1841, when numerous\r\nvery interesting remains were brought to light. These included an\r\nextensive series of incised sepulchral slabs, of very early date,\r\nbearing crosses of various forms, and many interesting devices; several\r\nancient crosses used as headstones; a considerable and extremely\r\nbeautiful assemblage of fragments of encaustic paving tiles; and\r\nseveral fragments of coped tombs, and of crosses with the interlaced\r\nornament so characteristic of the Saxon period, as well as many\r\nstone coffins, and sculptured fragments of mouldings, capitals, &c.,\r\nbelonging to the more ancient edifice.\r\n\r\nOf these curious remains the greater part were preserved in the porch\r\nof the church, and consist of considerably more than fifty incised\r\nslabs—some of which are perfect, and others in fragments—and perhaps\r\na score or two of other stones. It is also stated, and is much to be\r\nregretted, that at least four times the number of sculptured stones\r\npreserved were rebuilt into the walls during the alterations, so that,\r\nincluding a number taken away and now preserved at Lomberdale, there\r\nmust have been from three to four hundred found. In the same porch, a\r\nselection of the ornamented paving tiles is also preserved; among the\r\npatterns are many of extreme beauty and elegance.\r\n\r\nThe font is also deserving of especial notice. It is octagonal, each of\r\nits sides bearing a figure beneath a crocketed canopy. A fragment of\r\nanother ancient font will be seen in the porch.\r\n\r\nThe part of Bakewell Church, however, with which we have now\r\nparticularly to do is the VERNON CHAPEL, in which, divided from the\r\nsouth transept by a beautiful open oak screen, lie buried the later\r\nVernons and the earlier members of the Manners family connected with\r\nHaddon. This chapel was, it appears, erected “late in the Decorated\r\nperiod, about 1360, upon the walls of the former chapel. The\r\nEarly-English half-pillars at each extremity of the arches had been\r\nretained, and were very beautiful examples, well worthy of imitation.\r\nThe hollows of the mouldings, up to a certain height, being filled\r\nwith bold roses, capitals in a different style were afterwards added\r\nto suit the decorated arches. The central pillars, with their central\r\nclustered shafts, are of singularly elegant design; the tracery of the\r\nwindows partakes of the flamboyant character. The upper part of the\r\nbuttresses was also altered to correspond with the new work.” It will\r\nbear comparison with any structure of the kind in England, and has been\r\nrebuilt in good taste.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the Vernon Chapel stands a fine altar-tomb, bearing\r\nthe recumbent effigies of Sir George Vernon, the “King of the Peak,”\r\nand his two wives, Margaret Taylebois and Maude Langford. This tomb is\r\nan extremely beautiful and characteristic example of the elaborately\r\ndecorated monuments of the period to which it belongs. Along its sides,\r\nunder a series of canopied arches, are figures bearing shields of the\r\narms of the Vernons and their alliances and those of the families of\r\nhis two wives. Sir George is habited in plate armour and surcoat,\r\nand wears a straight long beard and straight hair. He has a double\r\nchain and a sword. The inscription on this interesting tomb is as\r\nfollows:—“Here lyeth S^r George Vernon, Knight, deceased ye —— daye\r\nof —— an^o 1561, and Dame Margaret his wyffe, daughter of Sir Gylbert\r\nTayleboys, deceased ye —— daye of —— 156—; and also dame Mawde\r\nhis wyffe, dawght^r to S^r Ralphe Langford, deceased ye —— daye of\r\n—— anno 156— whose solles God pdon.” The inscription, it will be\r\nseen, has never been finished, the blanks for the dates not having been\r\nfilled up. The surcoat worn by the knight is elaborately emblazoned\r\nwith his own arms with all its quarterings; and, taken altogether, this\r\nis a remarkably fine and interesting monument.\r\n\r\nAt the south end of the chapel stands, to visitors to Haddon, perhaps\r\nthe most interesting of its monuments. It is that of Dorothy Vernon,\r\nabout whose elopement we have already discoursed, and her husband, Sir\r\nJohn Manners, with their children. This lady, it will be recollected,\r\nwas one of the daughters and co-heiresses of Sir George Vernon, whose\r\nmonument we have just been describing, and his first wife Margaret\r\nTaylebois, and by her marriage with Sir John Manners, she conveyed\r\nHaddon Hall and the other Derbyshire estates of the Vernons to the\r\nfamily of Manners, to whom they still belong. This monument we, for the\r\nfirst time, engrave. It is a large and very imposing-looking erection.\r\nAt the top, in the centre, is a large shield, bearing the shield of\r\nManners, with its sixteen quarterings, and on either side is an obelisk\r\nornament, one of which bears the arms of Manners and the other of\r\nVernon. Beneath these is a bold cornice and ornamental frieze, on which\r\nagain occur three shields with the arms, respectively, in the centre\r\nManners impaling Vernon; and on one side Avenell, and on the other\r\nRoos.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Monument of Sir John Manners and his wife, Dorothy\r\nVernon._]\r\n\r\nThis cornet and frieze surmount a semicircular arch, beneath which\r\nare the kneeling figures, facing each other, of Sir John Manners, in\r\nplate armour, and his wife, Dorothy Vernon, in close-fitting dress,\r\nwith cap, and frill or ruff around the neck. Between them there is\r\na pedestal, bearing the following incription:—“Here lyeth S^r John\r\nManners, of Haddon, Knight, second sonne of Thoas, Erle of Rutland, who\r\ndyed the 4 of June, 1611, and Dorothie his wife, one of the daughters\r\nand heires to S^r George Vernon, of Haddon, Knight, who deceased the 24\r\nday of June, in the 26 yere of the raigne of Queen Elizabeth, 1584.”\r\nAbove the pedestal is a large shield, with quarterings of the armorial\r\nbearings of the families of Manners and Vernon and their alliances;\r\nthe shields bearing the sixteen quarterings of Manners, differenced\r\nwith a crescent, impaled with the twelve quarterings of Vernon. On the\r\nspandrels are also shields of arms, the one bearing Manners quartering\r\nRoos and two others; and the other, Vernon quartering Avenel and two\r\nothers. The lower part of the monument contains four figures of the\r\nchildren of Sir John and his wife Dorothy, and two shields, the one\r\nbearing the arms of Manners, and the other those of Vernon.\r\n\r\nAt the opposite or north end of the chapel is a much larger and more\r\npretentious monument, that of Sir George Manners, son and heir of Sir\r\nJohn Manners and Dorothy Vernon, and of his wife, Grace Pierrepoint.\r\nAt the top is a large shield bearing the arms of Manners with its\r\nsixteen quarterings, and on each side is an obelisk. Beneath these is\r\na massive and bold cornice, supported on Corinthian pillars, forming a\r\nrecess in which is a semicircular arch, elaborately carved, and over\r\nit the inscription, “The day of a man’s death is better than the day\r\nof his birth.” Under this arch and cornice are the effigies of Sir\r\nGeorge Manners and his wife, kneeling, and facing each other, while\r\nbetween them is a double desk, or lectern, on the front of which are\r\nthe words—“Thy prayers and thine alms are gone up before thee,” and\r\na shield bearing the arms of Manners impaling Pierrepoint. Behind the\r\nfigures, on a tablet, is a Latin inscription, which has been thus\r\ntranslated:—“Sir George Manners of Haddon, Knt., here waits the\r\nresurrection of the just in Christ. He married Grace, second daughter\r\nof Sir Henry Pierrepoint, Knt., who afterwards bore to him four sons\r\nand five daughters, and lived with him in holy wedlock thirty years.\r\nShe caused him to be buried with his forefathers, and then placed this\r\nmonument, at her own expense, as a perpetual memorial of their conjugal\r\nfaith, and she joined the figure of his body with hers, having vowed\r\ntheir ashes and bones should be laid together. He died 23rd April,\r\n1623, aged 54. She died ——.” Sir George is represented in armour,\r\nand his lady is habited in close dress, with ruff, hood or coif, and\r\nlong veil. Beneath the figures of the knight and his lady, the monument\r\nis divided into two heights, each of which is formed into an arcade\r\nholding the effigies of their children. The upper arcade consists\r\nof four semicircular arches, with shields of armorial bearings in\r\nthe spandrels. Within the first of these arches is the effigy of the\r\neldest son—a “chrisom child”—who died in infancy and is, as usual,\r\nrepresented bound up, mummy fashion, in swaddling-clothes; in the\r\nsecond, the kneeling effigy, in armour, of John Manners, who ultimately\r\nsucceeded to the title of eighth Earl of Rutland; and in the third\r\nand fourth, those of two of the daughters. In the lower arcade, which\r\nis formed of five archways, the first two being semicircular and the\r\nremaining three pointed, are respectively the kneeling effigies of\r\nHenry Manners, who died at the age of fourteen, and is habited as a\r\nyouth; Roger Manners, in armour; and three daughters. In the spandrels\r\nof the arches, as in the upper arcade, are a series of shields with\r\narmorial bearings. Over the nine arches are the nine inscriptions as\r\nfollows:—Over the “chrisom child,” “Mine age is nothing in respect\r\nof thee;” over the son and heir, “One generation passeth and another\r\ncometh;” over the youth, Henry Manners, “My days were but a span long;”\r\nover the fourth son, Roger, “By the grace of God I am what I am;” over\r\nthe daughters, beginning with the eldest, “A virtuous woman is a crown\r\nto her husband,” “The wise woman buildeth her house,” “A gracious woman\r\nretaineth honour,” “A prudent wife is from the Lord,” and “She that\r\nfeareth the Lord shall be praised.” On the pedestal by Sir George,\r\n“Christ is to me both in death and life an advantage,” and on the\r\nopposite one, by his wife, “I shall go to him, he shall not return to\r\nme.” The arms on the shields are those of Manners, differenced with\r\na crescent; Pierrepoint; Manners impaling Montague; Sutton impaling\r\nManners; Howard impaling Manners; and the other alliances also impaled.\r\n\r\nOn the wall is a memorial to John Manners, son of Dorothy Vernon and\r\nher husband, Sir John Manners, with the inscription—“Heare lieth\r\nburied John Manners, gentleman, third son of S^r John Manners, Knight,\r\nwho died the xvi day of July, in the yeere of our Lord God 1590, being\r\nof the age of 14 yeers.”\r\n\r\nThe most ancient, and certainly one of the most interesting, monuments\r\nin the church, is that of Sir Thomas de Wendesley, or Wensley, of\r\nWensley, who was killed at the battle of Shrewsbury in 1403. It is an\r\naltar-tomb, with the recumbent effigy of the knight in plate armour,\r\nwearing the conical helmet or bascinet, and camail or tippet of chain\r\nmail, with gussets of the same at the arm-pits. His girdle, which is\r\nexceedingly rich, encircles his hips; the sword is lost, but the dagger\r\nremains. His surcoat is emblazoned with his arms, and he wears the\r\ncollar of SS. On the front of the helmet is inscribed IHO NAZAREN.\r\n\r\nIn the chancel is an altar-tomb to John Vernon, 1477, the inscription\r\non which runs as follows:—“Hic jacet Johis Vernon filius et heres\r\nHenrici Vernon qui obiit xii die mensis Augusti Anno Dni Mo cccclxxvii\r\ncuj anime piciet̄ dē;” and in the Vernon Chapel is an incised slab,\r\nwith the arms of Eyre.\r\n\r\nIn the nave is a small but exceedingly beautiful monument bearing the\r\nhalf-length effigies, side by side, under an elaborately-crocketed\r\ncanopy, of Sir Godfrey Foljambe and Avena his wife. The knight is\r\nrepresented in armour, with conical helmet or bascinet, and tippet of\r\nchain mail; his surcoat bearing the arms of Foljambe. The lady wears a\r\nreticulated caul. In each of the spandrels is a shield, the one bearing\r\nthe arms of Foljambe, the other that of the family of Ireland, of\r\nHartshorne, to which the lady belonged.\r\n\r\nThere are several tablets and inscriptions in various parts of the\r\nchurch which are worthy of a passing glance, and there are also some\r\nmemorial stained-glass windows of good design. Among these is one in\r\nmemory of the late Duke of Rutland, representing the Resurrection,\r\nbearing the following inscription:—“The above window was erected,\r\nby subscription, in memory of John Henry, Duke of Rutland, who died\r\n20th January, 1857, aged seventy-nine years.” Others are put in to the\r\nmemory of the late Mr. Allcard and of Mr. Jonathan Wilson and others.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the interior of this fine old church, it will, no doubt,\r\ninterest the visitor to be told in fewer words, and more correctly\r\nthan could be gleaned from the strange tales sometimes told in the\r\nplace, the story of the uncovering of the remains of Dorothy Vernon,\r\nher husband, and other members of the family, during the rebuilding\r\nand alteration of the church. When the excavations were commenced on\r\nthe site of the monument of Sir John Manners and his wife Dorothy\r\nVernon, the remains of two persons, supposed to be the knight and his\r\nlady, were found; the skull of the one was identified as that of Sir\r\nJohn, by its peculiar form and its likeness to his sculptured effigy;\r\nthat of the other, which lay near it, with beautiful auburn hair still\r\nattached, among which were some pins that had been used to fasten\r\nit—was naturally, and no doubt correctly, considered to be that of the\r\nonce lovely Dorothy. In another part three children’s leaden coffins\r\nwere found, but not opened, and the bones of an infant (probably the\r\n“chrisom child,” represented on the tomb of Sir George Manners) were\r\ndiscovered rolled up in a sheet of lead. These, no doubt, were the\r\nchildren of different members of the Manners family. A leaden coffin\r\nwas also found which contained the body of a lady. The part of the lid\r\nover the head had been violently torn away—the piece of the sheet of\r\nlead being missing—and this was carefully and thoroughly examined. The\r\nbody had been buried in lime, but the part of the lid had been torn\r\noff, the head cut off, taken out and surgically examined, and then\r\nhastily replaced, but with the face downwards. The rest of the body was\r\nundisturbed. Several other bodies were, of course, found, as were some\r\nfew other interesting matters which require no notice here.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Ancient Cross, Bakewell Churchyard._]\r\n\r\nIn the churchyard, near the east wall of the south transept, stands\r\none of the finest so-called “Runic crosses” in the kingdom. It is,\r\nexclusive of the modern pedestal, about eight feet in height: the upper\r\nlimb of the cross is broken off. Of this fine old cross we give an\r\nengraving. The front of the cross, which in bad taste has been turned\r\ntowards the wall, is sculptured in four heights, with figures beneath\r\narches—the upper group being the Crucifixion: the whole, however,\r\nis much defaced. The opposite side, the one shown in our engraving,\r\nis boldly sculptured, with a beautiful scroll-pattern of foliage\r\nterminating at the top in an animal, and at the bottom is a cross\r\nwithin a circle; on the head is a figure on horseback. The sides of\r\nthe cross are sculptured in scroll-work of foliage, of much the same\r\ndesign as the side just described; the end of one of the limbs bears an\r\ninterlaced ornament, and the other a figure. This cross, and the one\r\nat Eyam, a few miles distant, are among the most perfect and beautiful\r\nremaining examples of the early period to which they belong.\r\n\r\nIf the tourist still wishes to linger for a few minutes in the\r\nchurchyard, he will find much to interest, to please, and to amuse him.\r\nTo _interest_ him in examining the external features of the church,\r\nespecially the Norman doorway and arcade, &c., at the west end, and the\r\nbeautiful doorway of Early-English design on the south side, as well as\r\nthe stone coffins grouped together in one corner. To _please_ him, in\r\nthe magnificent view he obtains of the surrounding country, especially\r\nof the valley of the Wye as it runs its zig-zag course towards Haddon;\r\nand to _amuse_ him, in reading the strange verses which occur on some\r\nof the grave-stones which crowd around him on every side, and in the\r\nchurch itself.\r\n\r\nOne of these, to the memory of a former parish clerk and leader of the\r\nchoir, reads as follows:—\r\n\r\n “ERECTED TO THE MEMORY OF PHILIP ROE, WHO DIED 12TH SEPTEMBER, 1815,\r\n AGED 52 YEARS.\r\n\r\n  “The vocal Powers, here let us mark,\r\n  Of PHILIP, our late Parish Clerk.\r\n  In church, none ever heard a Layman\r\n  With a clearer Voice say Amen!\r\n  Oh! who with Hallelujah’s Sound\r\n  Like Him can make the Roofs resound.\r\n  The Choir lament his Choral Tones,\r\n  The Town—so soon here lie his Bones.\r\n  Sleep undisturbed, within thy peaceful shrine,\r\n  Till angels wake thee with such tones as thine.”\r\n\r\nAnother long inscription to the memory of John Dale, barber-surgeon, of\r\nBakewell, and his two wives, Elizabeth Foljambe and Sarah Bloodworth,\r\n1757, thus curiously ends:—\r\n\r\n “Know, posterity, that on the 8th of April, in the year of grace 1757,\r\n the rambling remains of the above-said John Dale were, in the 86th\r\n yeare of his pilgrimage, laid upon his two wives.\r\n\r\n  “This thing in life might raise some jealousy,\r\n  Here all three lie together lovingly,\r\n  But from embraces here no pleasure flows,\r\n  Alike are here all human joys and woes;\r\n  Here Sarah’s chiding John no longer hears,\r\n  And old John’s rambling Sarah no more fears;\r\n  A period’s come to all their toilsome lives,\r\n  The good man’s quiet; still are both his wives.”\r\n\r\nAnother reads as follows:—\r\n\r\n  “These lines I with watery eye\r\n    For my dear friend indite,\r\n  Who for his worth, none such on earth,\r\n    Heaven crown him with true light.\r\n\r\n  “A lawyer just, a steward most just,\r\n    As ever sate in court,\r\n  Who lived beloved, with tears interred,\r\n    This is his true report.”\r\n\r\nAnother, locally said to have been written by Charles Wesley, brother\r\nto the founder of Methodism, reads as follows:—\r\n\r\n  “Beneath, a sleeping infant lies,\r\n    To earth whose body lent,\r\n  More glorious shall hereafter rise,\r\n    Though not more innocent;\r\n  When the Archangel’s trump shall blow,\r\n    And souls to bodies join,\r\n  Thousands shall wish their lives below\r\n    Had been as short as thine.”\r\n\r\nIt may be as well to note that the principal inn at Bakewell is the\r\nRutland Arms: it is a family hotel, but there are other comfortable\r\ninns in the place. Opposite the Rutland Arms are the baths and\r\nbath-gardens: the baths, which were known to the Romans, have the\r\nreputation of being efficacious in rheumatism.\r\n\r\nHaving already very briefly alluded to the routes by which Haddon Hall\r\nmay be visited both from Buxton on the one hand, and from Derby on the\r\nother, and having then spoken of some of the attractions of Buxton,\r\nit may be well now to say a few words regarding Matlock Bath, through\r\nwhich the visitor will pass by rail on his journey from London, from\r\nDerby, or from the North.\r\n\r\nMATLOCK BATH is about seven miles from Haddon Hall; and, exclusive of\r\nits baths, which are as famous as those of Buxton, and for the benefit\r\nof which the invalid may pass the season pleasantly and profitably,\r\nit has attractions of scenery which no other inland watering-place\r\ncan boast. Its “High Tor” rising almost perpendicularly to a height\r\nof about 400 feet above the river Derwent, which flows at its base;\r\nits “Lovers’ Walks,” winding along by the side of the river, and\r\nzig-zagging up the mountain side; its “Heights of Abraham” and “Masson”\r\ntowering over the valley: its “romantic rocks,” and its many caverns;\r\nits petrifying wells, its “grottoes,” and its other attractions, render\r\nMatlock Bath a place of delight to the tourist; while the surrounding\r\ndistrict, rich in minerals, in ferns, and in other botanical specimens,\r\nand full of gorgeous scenery, is “passing beautiful,” and will amply\r\nrepay the pleasant labour of exploring.\r\n\r\nAt Matlock Bath the principal hotels are the “New Bath,” “Walker’s\r\nTerrace Hotel,” “The Temple,” and “Hodgkinson’s,” and the place swarms\r\nwith lodging-houses and all things to attract and to keep the tourist.\r\nFrom Matlock, delightful day-trips may be made to Haddon Hall, to\r\nHardwick Hall, to Chatsworth, the “Palace of the Peak”—the princely\r\nseat of the Duke of Devonshire; to Dovedale, with its glorious scenery,\r\nand its pleasant associations with old Izaac Walton and Charles Cotton;\r\nto the Via Gellia and its surroundings; to Lea Hurst, the early home of\r\nFlorence Nightingale; and to numberless other places of interest—all\r\neasily attainable by railroad or carriage.\r\n\r\nAnd now, may not a visit to this grand old Hall be productive of\r\nthought? First, let us give thanks to the noble owner—the Duke of\r\nRutland—that he freely opens its gates to all comers, keeps it in a\r\nstate of neatness and order, and takes special care that Time shall\r\nmake no farther inroads on the mansion of his ancestors, preserving\r\nit for the enjoyment of all who seek instruction and pleasure there;\r\npermitting them, indeed, to make of one of its rooms a dinner-room for\r\nthe day; rendering it, in fact, the common property of the public,\r\nand by his occasional presence ascertaining that all is done that can\r\nbe done for their happiness while in its gardens or within its walls:\r\nthus practically commenting on the exhortation and protest of the\r\nPoet-laureate—\r\n\r\n  “Why don’t those acred sirs\r\n  Throw up their parks some dozen times a year,\r\n  And let the people breathe?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHATFIELD HOUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nHATFIELD is entitled to high rank among the Stately Homes of England,\r\nwhether we consider its architectural merits, its historical\r\nassociations, or the picturesque attractions by which it is surrounded.\r\nSeven centuries have passed since Hatfield became a place of note; and\r\nthe crown, the mitre, and the coronet have successively held sway over\r\nits destinies. Of its architectural glories, little now remains of a\r\ndate anterior to that of James I., in whose reign the present noble\r\nhouse was built. A part, however, of the previous _palace_ of Hatfield\r\nstill exists, interesting as the home of the Princess Elizabeth, during\r\nthe reign of her sister, Queen Mary. Nor was her residence here, though\r\ncompulsory, a state of imprisonment and oppression, as some have said;\r\nfor it is proved, from various records, that she met with considerate\r\ntreatment, and lived in a state befitting her lofty rank and queenly\r\nprospects, till, on the death of Mary, she proceeded hence to take\r\npossession of the throne of England.\r\n\r\nHatfield House lies some twenty miles from London, in the county\r\nof Hertford, and is the seat of the most noble the Marquis of\r\nSalisbury—the representative of the grand old line of the Cecils.\r\nThe history of the mansion is one of considerable interest, dating,\r\nas its name _Hetfelle_ indicates, from Saxon times, and undergoing\r\nmany changes under its royal and noble and ecclesiastical owners. It\r\nbelonged to the Saxon kings until, in the reign of Edgar, it was given\r\nby that monarch to the monastery of St. Etheldreda, at Ely, which was\r\nfounded in 673, destroyed in 870, and refounded in 970, and erected\r\ninto a bishopric in 1108, in the reign of Henry I.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Old Palace at Hatfield._]\r\n\r\nThus Hatfield being attached to the new bishopric, and the manor\r\nbecoming one of the many residences of the prelates, acquired, it is\r\nsaid, its appellation of “Bishop’s Hatfield.” Hatfield continued to be\r\none of the palaces of the Bishops of Ely, and was occasionally used as\r\na royal residence, until the reign of Henry VIII., when it was made\r\nover to the crown. “William de Hatfield, second son of Edward the\r\nThird, was born at the palace,” and at various times before it finally\r\nbecame vested in the crown, it was used and frequented by royalty.\r\nDuring the latter part of the reign of Henry VIII. the young Prince\r\nEdward, afterwards Edward VI., resided at this palace, and is variously\r\nstated to have been here and at Hertford when the news of the death of\r\nhis father was conveyed to him, and when, consequently, his accession\r\nto the crown took place. In the fourth year of his reign the youthful\r\nmonarch conveyed Hatfield to his sister, the Princess Elizabeth,\r\nafterwards Queen Elizabeth, and here she frequently resided. Indeed,\r\nthe greater part of the troublous reign of Mary, the Princess passed at\r\nHatfield, “with few privations and no personal hardships to endure,”\r\nbut with much mental torture; for it must not be forgotten that she\r\nhad been removed from Ashbridge to London and imprisoned in the Tower,\r\nfor her supposed participation in Wyatt’s rebellion, and was then,\r\nunder surveillance, permitted to retire to Hatfield. It was at Hatfield\r\nthat Elizabeth, it is said, while seated under an oak, received the\r\nwelcome intelligence of the death of her sister, “the bloody Queen”\r\nMary, and on hearing the news she fell upon her knees, exclaiming in\r\nLatin, _A Domino factum est istud, et est mirabile oralis nostris_ (“It\r\nis the Lord’s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes”), words which\r\nshe adopted as a motto for her gold coinage, while on her silver issue\r\nshe chose the somewhat similar one, _Posui Deum adjutorem meum_ (“I\r\nhave chosen God for my helper”). Thus Hatfield became identified with\r\nthe coinage of the realm as well as with many of its rulers. The day\r\nfollowing this event Elizabeth was waited upon at Hatfield by several\r\nnoblemen of the late queen’s Council, whom she received very kindly,\r\n“but presently showed her decided preference for Sir William Cecil\r\n(afterwards Lord Burleigh)—the astute, the most politic Cecil—whom\r\nshe instantly appointed principal Secretary of State.” On the 23rd of\r\nNovember the Queen removed from Hatfield with an escort of more than\r\na thousand persons, and made her progress by slow degrees to Somerset\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nIn 1587 Elizabeth had, it is recorded, been visited at Hatfield by\r\nMary, whom she received with much state, and with great festivity,\r\nplaying herself upon the virginals, to accompany a child who sang. It\r\nwas at Hatfield, too, it is said, that Elizabeth received the proposals\r\nof marriage from the King of Sweden for his son Eric, which she turned\r\nto such profitable account with her sister by declaring that she would\r\nnever listen to any overtures of this nature which had not previously\r\nreceived her Majesty’s sanction.\r\n\r\nIt does not appear that after her accession to the throne Queen\r\nElizabeth ever resided at Hatfield, although she had previously been\r\nmuch attached to the place, and had kept up Christmas revels and\r\nShrovetide and other festivities in a liberal manner. At one of these,\r\nSir Thomas Pope, her guardian, made “for the Ladie Elizabeth, alle\r\nat his own costes, a greate and rich maskinge, in the great hall\r\nat Hatfielde, where the pageauntes were marvelously furnished” with\r\n“banket of sweete dishes,” “a suttletie in thirty spyce,” and wonderful\r\ngarnishings, but for which “folliries” Sir Thomas got “snubbed” by his\r\nqueen, who ordered these mummeries to cease.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Front View._]\r\n\r\nJames I., in the third year of his reign, exchanged Hatfield for the\r\nhouse, manor, and park of Theobalds, with his minister, Sir Robert\r\nCecil, afterwards created Earl of Salisbury, whose descendant, the\r\nMarquis of Salisbury, is the present owner, the estates passing in\r\nregular succession from that time to the present day, and continuing to\r\nbe the principal residence of that noble family, about whom we now give\r\nsome details.\r\n\r\nThe family of Cecil is one of considerable antiquity, and many of its\r\nmembers have distinguished themselves both in statesmanship, in the\r\nfield, and in the arena of literature. The greatness of the family was\r\nlaid by Sir William Cecil, the friend and adviser of Queen Elizabeth\r\nbefore she came to the throne, and her first chief Secretary of State.\r\n“This distinguished statesman,” says Sir Robert Naunton, “was the son\r\nof a younger brother of the Cecills of Hertfordshire, a family of my\r\nown knowledge, though now private, yet of no mean antiquity, who, being\r\nexposed and sent to the city, as poor gentlemen used to do their sons,\r\nbecame to be a rich man on London Bridge, and purchased (estates) in\r\nLincolnshire where this man was born.” First he became Secretary to\r\nthe Protector Somerset, and afterwards, on the accession of Elizabeth,\r\nhe was appointed Secretary of State. In 1561 he was made President of\r\nthe Court of Wards. His great talent and assiduity won for him much\r\nregard at court, where he was treated with great favour. In 1571 he\r\nwas created Lord Burleigh, and continued to maintain his distinguished\r\nposition in the state till his death. He resided chiefly at Theobalds,\r\nwhere he often had the honour of entertaining his sovereign, who was\r\n“sene in as great royalty, and served as bountifully and magnificently,\r\nas at anie other tyme or place, all at his lordship’s chardge,” &c. The\r\nevents in the life of this statesman are so closely associated with the\r\nhistory of England itself in the stirring times in which he lived, that\r\nthey are too well known to need more than a passing notice. After being\r\nmixed up in every affair of state from some time before the accession\r\nof Elizabeth, having taken part in all the proceedings connected with\r\nthe unfortunate Mary Queen of Scots, and with his own hand drawn up her\r\ndeath-warrant, and after having for forty years mainly directed the\r\ncouncils of the “Virgin Queen,” Sir William Cecil, now Lord Burleigh,\r\ndied on the 4th of August, 1598, in the seventh-eighth year of his age,\r\nto the great grief of Elizabeth, who is said to have wept bitter tears\r\nat his death.\r\n\r\nThe eldest son of Lord Treasurer Burleigh succeeded him in his title,\r\nwhich has since been augmented by the Earldom and Marquisate of Exeter;\r\nwhile his youngest son, Sir Robert Cecil, inherited much of his\r\nfather’s talent and wisdom, “with a more subtle policy and a superior\r\ncapacity for state intrigue.” For certain secret services to James,\r\nduring the life of Elizabeth, he was raised by the king to the peerage.\r\nIn 1604 he was created Viscount Cranborne, and, in the year following,\r\nhe was made Earl of Salisbury. After filling the office of sole\r\nSecretary of State, he succeeded, on the death of the Earl of Dorset,\r\nto the high post of Lord Treasurer. “Shrewd, subtle, and penetrating,”\r\nhe discharged his duties with great ability, and while attending to\r\nthe interests of his country, forgot not his own, having, “by various\r\nmethods,” increased his inheritance to a very ample extent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Garden Front of Hatfield House._]\r\n\r\nAfter taking a prominent part in the affairs of state during\r\nElizabeth’s reign, he was the one who, on her death-bed, succeeded in\r\ninducing her to name her successor. Cecil, who was then her Secretary,\r\napproached her bed with the lord-keeper and the lord-admiral, and\r\nbegged the dying Queen to name her successor, when she started and\r\nsaid, “I told you my seat had been the seat of kings; I will have no\r\n_rascal_ to succeed me!”—when Cecil boldly asked her what she meant by\r\n“no rascal?”—to which she replied, a king should succeed her, and who\r\ncould that be but her cousin of Scotland? and she begged to be no more\r\ntroubled. Nevertheless, some hours later Cecil again “besought her, if\r\nshe would have the King of Scots to succeed her, she would show a sign\r\nunto them, whereat, suddenly heaving herself up in her bed, she held\r\nboth her hands joined together over her head in manner of a crown. Then\r\nshe sank down, fell into a doze, and at three o’clock in the morning\r\ndied in a stupor.” Five hours after her death, Cecil proclaimed James\r\nof Scotland, King of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland, Defender\r\nof the Faith, &c., and thus at once secured the country against\r\nconflicting claimants to the crown. Soon afterwards he received the new\r\nmonarch at Theobalds, who a few days later rewarded him by important\r\noffices, and by creating him Baron Cecil and afterwards Viscount\r\nCranborne and Earl of Salisbury. From the moment of James’s accession,\r\nthrough all the troublous times of the gunpowder plot, and all the\r\nmatters relating to Lady Arabella Stuart, to Sir Walter Raleigh, and\r\nothers, down to 1612, Cecil’s was one of the most prominent names\r\nin the kingdom. In that year “he died, worn out and wretched, at\r\nMarlborough, on his way back to court.” In his last moments he said,\r\n“Ease and pleasure quake to hear of death; but my life, full of cares\r\nand miseries, desireth to be dissolved.” It was this nobleman who\r\nexchanged his mansion of Theobalds, with the king, for Hatfield. On\r\nhis death, his title and estates descended to his only son, William\r\nCecil, who became second Earl of Salisbury; and, dying in 1688, was\r\nsucceeded by James Cecil, as third Earl of Salisbury. The fourth Earl\r\nof Salisbury, also named James, died in 1694, and his great grandson,\r\nJames Cecil, the seventh Earl, was created Marquis of Salisbury by\r\nGeorge III., in 1789. This nobleman had succeeded his father in 1780.\r\nHe married the Lady Mary Amelia Hill, second daughter of the Marquis\r\nof Downshire, by whom he had issue a son, who succeeded him, and two\r\ndaughters. He died in 1823, and was succeeded, as second Marquis of\r\nSalisbury, by his only son, James Brownlow Williams Cecil, Viscount\r\nCranborne, who was born in 1791. His lordship married, first, in 1821,\r\nFrances Mary Gascoigne, daughter and heiress of Bamber Gascoigne, Esq.,\r\nand assumed the surname of Gascoigne-Cecil. By this marriage he had\r\nissue three sons, Lord James Emilius William Evelyn Gascoigne-Cecil\r\n(who died during the lifetime of his father), Lord Robert Arthur Talbot\r\nGascoigne-Cecil, the present Marquis, and Lord Eustace Brownlow Henry\r\nGascoigne-Cecil, M.P.; and two daughters, the Lady Mildred Arabella\r\nCharlotte Henrietta, married to A. J. B. Beresford Hope, M.P., and\r\nthe Lady Blanche Mary Harriet, married to the late J. M. Balfour,\r\nEsq. The marquis married secondly, in 1847, the Lady Mary Catherine\r\nSackville-West, daughter of Earl Delawarr, by whom he had issue three\r\nsons and two daughters, Lords Sackville Arthur, Arthur, and Lionel; and\r\nLadies Mary Isabella (married to the Earl of Galloway), and Margaret\r\nElizabeth. His lordship died in 1868, and his widow, the Marchioness of\r\nSalisbury, was re-married, in 1870, to the present Earl of Derby. He\r\nwas succeeded by his son, the present peer.\r\n\r\nRobert Arthur Talbot Gascoigne-Cecil, third Marquis and sixth Earl\r\nof Salisbury, Viscount Cranborne, and Baron Cecil, Chancellor of\r\nthe University of Oxford, was born in 1830, was educated at Eton and\r\nat Christ Church, Oxford (B.A., 1850, M.A. and Fellow of All Souls’\r\nCollege, 1853), and in 1853 was returned to parliament as M.P. for\r\nStamford, for which place he sat until, in 1868, he succeeded to the\r\ntitle. In 1866-7 he held the office of Secretary of State for India,\r\nand still holds many important local appointments. In 1857 his lordship\r\nmarried Georgina, daughter of Sir Edward Hall Alderson, Baron of the\r\nCourt of Exchequer, by whom he has issue living four sons, viz., James\r\nEdward Hubert, Viscount Cranborne, born 1861; Rupert William Ernest,\r\nborn 1863; Algernon Edward Robert, born 1864, and another born 1869;\r\nand two daughters, Beatrix, born in 1858, and Gwendolen, born in 1860.\r\nHis lordship is patron of eight livings in Hertfordshire, Dorsetshire,\r\nand Essex. The arms of the Marquis of Salisbury are quarterly, first\r\nand fourth CECIL, viz., barry of ten, _argent_ and _azure_, over all\r\nsix escutcheons, three, two and one, _sable_, each charged with a lion\r\nrampant, _argent_, a crescent, _gules_, for difference; second and\r\nthird GASCOIGNE, viz., _argent_, on a pale, _sable_, a conger’s head,\r\nerased and erect, _or_, charged with an ermine spot. Crests, first, on\r\na wreath six arrows in saltire, _or_, barbed and feathered, _argent_,\r\nbanded, _gules_, buckled and garnished, _or_, surmounted by a morion or\r\nsteel cap, proper (Cecil); second, on a wreath a conger’s head erased\r\nand erect, _or_, charged with an ermine spot (Gascoigne). Supporters,\r\ntwo lions, ermine.\r\n\r\nHatfield House is of vast extent; it is of brick, with stone dressings.\r\nIt was built between the years 1605 and 1611 by Robert Cecil, first\r\nEarl of Salisbury. After being suffered to fall into decay, it was\r\nrestored and beautified by the sixth earl, about the middle of the last\r\ncentury.[38] In 1835, a great part of the west wing was destroyed by\r\nfire (in which the Dowager Marchioness of Salisbury perished), little\r\nbeing left of that part of the house besides the outer walls. On this\r\ndisaster occurring, occasion was taken to effect a general reparation\r\nof the entire building. The house is built in the form of a half H,\r\ncomprising a centre and two wings, the hollow part being turned towards\r\nthe south. The centre is a magnificent example of the Palladian style,\r\nand, although of mixed architecture, presents, in its totality, a\r\ndesign of great richness and beauty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The East View._]\r\n\r\nThe basement-story contains an arcade with eight arches, divided\r\nexternally by pilasters, whereof the upper parts are fluted, and the\r\nlower parts enriched with Elizabethan arabesques. The lower pilasters\r\nare Doric, the upper Ionic. The wings are massive and comparatively\r\nplain, supported at each corner by square turrets, seventy feet high\r\nto the gilded vanes: the space between, comprising three stories, is\r\nrelieved by a fine oriel window of two stories. The centre tower, over\r\nthe grand entrance, is also seventy feet high; it has three stories\r\nwith coupled columns at the corners, the whole having an agreeable\r\npyramidal effect. The third story of the tower contains a clock, and\r\nalso the armorial bearings of the founder, with the date 1611, in which\r\nyear the present house was finished. The length of the southern front\r\nis 300 feet, the centre being 140 feet, and each wing 80 feet wide,\r\nwith a projection from the centre of 100 feet.\r\n\r\nThe northern front is plain—a severe simplicity, nearly allied to\r\ngrandeur, being its chief characteristic; the centre compartment, with\r\nits entrance-doorway below and noble clock-tower above, being the only\r\nelaboration it contains.\r\n\r\nThe south front contains the principal entrance, and, from its symmetry\r\nand ornate character, is, architecturally at least, the principal\r\none. The east front has, however, certain advantages, which go far\r\ntowards making it the most interesting, as it certainly is the most\r\npicturesque. The view in that direction, whether from the house or\r\nof it, is by far the most pleasing, as the founder well knew when he\r\ncaused the principal apartments to be placed on this side. The scene\r\nfrom these rooms is of remarkable interest and variety; first there is\r\na noble terrace-walk, with enriched parapet, over which the eye wanders\r\nat will among the clustering flowers of the Elizabethan garden, and\r\nfrom thence to the maze, beyond which is the park, with its fine sheet\r\nof water surrounded by noble old trees.\r\n\r\nEntering the mansion the visitor is admitted into a spacious HALL\r\nwhich leads to the GALLERY, in which are preserved many interesting\r\nrelics of former days. Among these are the saddle-cloth on which “good\r\nQueen Bess” sat on her white charger at Tilbury Fort, and another\r\nsaddle-cloth used by the first Earl of Salisbury, the celebrated Sir\r\nRobert Cecil; a large collection of arms, many of which were taken from\r\nthe “invincible Armada” of the Spaniards; and a number of models and\r\nother interesting objects. It contains also several effigies of men in\r\narmour, one of which is given in our initial letter.\r\n\r\nThe GRAND STAIRCASE is one of the most magnificent parts of this\r\npalatial residence. It occupies, in plan, a space of 35 by 21 feet,\r\nand comprises flights with five landings. “The balusters are massive,\r\nand carved in the Italian form; above the handrail are represented\r\ngenii, armorial lions, &c., and here is a hatch-gate, probably to keep\r\nthe favourite dogs from ascending to the drawing-rooms. The upper\r\ndivision of the ceiling is enriched by a very beautiful pendant in\r\nthe Florentine style,” relieved by gold and silver and colour. On the\r\nwalls are hung a series of family portraits of the Cecils by Lely,\r\nKneller, Vandyke, Zucchero, Reynolds, and others. At the foot of\r\nthe staircase is the DINING-ROOM, panelled throughout with oak, and\r\nhaving an enriched ceiling. Over the door is a marble bust of Lord\r\nBurleigh. Near this are the breakfast, summer, drawing, and other\r\nrooms, all of which are fitted and furnished in a style of sumptuous\r\nmagnificence, and contain a vast number of very valuable paintings.\r\nAmong the pictures contained in this noble mansion are no fewer than\r\nfive original portraits of Queen Elizabeth, including the celebrated\r\nlarge one by Zucchero; and many portraits, &c., which were the private\r\nproperty of that sovereign.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Gallery._]\r\n\r\nThe GREAT HALL, or MARBLE HALL, is 50 feet by 30 feet, and is extremely\r\nlofty. It is lit by an oriel window at the upper or daïs end, and\r\nby three bay windows; and is panelled with oak and lined with fine\r\nold tapestry. A carved screen, with an open gallery, decorated with\r\narmorial bearings, badges, &c., is at the east end, and the ceiling,\r\nwhich is coved and divided into compartments, is decorated with the\r\nheads of the Cæsars. Here are deposited two banners presented to the\r\nlate marquis by the Duke of Wellington—part of the “spoil” of Paris in\r\n1814: here are also two other banners taken in the Crimea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Hall._]\r\n\r\nThe Staircase leads, almost direct, to KING JAMES’S ROOM, or the GREAT\r\nCHAMBER, one of the noblest apartments of the house, the extreme\r\nmagnificence of which it is not easy to describe; in truth, it is too\r\nrich, and the eye turns involuntarily to the grand oriel windows for\r\nrelief. The ceiling is of exquisite design, and was till recently plain\r\nwhite; now it is all gold and colours. The chimney-piece is massive, of\r\nwhite marble; and a central niche over the fire contains a life-size\r\nstatue of James I. in dark stone. The fire-dogs are of silver; the\r\nfurniture and the six chandeliers are gilt; the curtains are of white\r\nsatin; the chair and sofa coverings are crimson velvet; and the carpet,\r\n“patent Axminster,” is of Elizabethan design, worked in brown, gold,\r\nscarlet, and blue. This room, which is very large, contains some of the\r\nmost important pictures, including Reynolds’s portraits of George III.\r\nand Queen Charlotte.\r\n\r\nThe GALLERY extends the whole length of the south front; it is about\r\n60 feet long and 20 feet wide. The ceiling is of remarkable beauty,\r\nand of the finest examples of a period that was most prolific in such\r\ndesigns. The walls are panelled with oak, and are profusely carved.\r\n\r\nThe LIBRARY, of equal dimensions with King James’s Room, is enriched\r\nover the chimney-piece with a fine mosaic portrait of the first Earl\r\nof Salisbury—1608. The collection of books and MSS. is of extreme\r\ninterest and value. Here, among other treasures, are preserved “the\r\nforty-two articles of Edward VI., with his autograph;” Cardinal\r\nWolsey’s instructions to the ambassador sent to the Pope by Henry\r\nVIII., with Wolsey’s autograph; and a pedigree of Queen Elizabeth,\r\nemblazoned, tracing her ancestry to Adam. The state papers in the\r\ncollection extend through the successive administrations of Lord\r\nBurleigh and his son, the first Earl of Salisbury, and include\r\ndocuments which came into Lord Burleigh’s hands through his connection\r\nwith the court. Here are no fewer than 13,000 letters, from the reign\r\nof Henry VIII. to that of James I. Among the earlier MSS. are copies\r\nof William of Malmesbury’s and Roger de Hoveden’s English History;\r\na splendid MS., with miniature of Henry VII.; another, with the\r\nautograph of Henry VI.; a treatise on Councils, by Archbishop Cranmer;\r\nthe original depositions touching the divorce of Anne of Cleves; the\r\nproclamation of Edward VI. on ascending the throne; the original\r\ncouncil-book of Queen Mary I.; historical MSS. by Lord Burleigh;\r\nthe Duke of Norfolk’s book of copies of his letters on the affairs\r\nof Mary Queen of Scots; accounts of the Earl of Northumberland’s\r\nconspiracies, and the actual draft, in the handwriting of Sir Robert\r\nCecil, of the proclamation declaring James of Scotland King of England,\r\nas well as the papers relating to the gunpowder plot, and to the\r\nRaleigh conspiracy, &c. Here are also many autograph letters of Queen\r\nElizabeth, and the famous Cecil papers, “the oak cradle of Queen\r\nElizabeth, the pair of silk stockings presented to her by Sir Thomas\r\nGresham, and the purse of James I.”\r\n\r\nThe CHAPEL is a remarkably fine and interesting room, with a\r\nrichly-painted window, and a gallery decorated with paintings of\r\nscriptural subjects.\r\n\r\nThe Park and grounds are full of fine trees, which from many points\r\noffer beautiful pictures, more particularly when seen in combination\r\nwith the house or garden-terraces. Among the grand old trees in the\r\npark are the “Lion Oak,” nearly 60 feet in girth, and a thousand years\r\nold; and “Queen Elizabeth’s Oak,” under which she is said to have been\r\nsitting when she received the news of her accession to the throne. The\r\nGardens and Vineyard are remarkably beautiful and interesting. The\r\nlatter, which is entered through an avenue of yew trees forming a\r\npicturesque wall on either side, and cut so as to give the appearance\r\nof walls and towers, with loopholes and battlements, is immortalised by\r\nPepys.\r\n\r\nThe Privy Garden, on the west side of the mansion, is enclosed within\r\na high and closely-cut hedge, with a close walk or avenue all around\r\nit. In each of the four angles stood a mulberry tree, said to have been\r\nplanted by King James I., and in the centre is a pond surrounded by\r\nrock-work.\r\n\r\nThe three pairs of splendid entrance-gates, of French metal work, and\r\nof the most elaborate and artistic character, were put up by the late\r\nMarquis of Salisbury in 1846, when Hatfield House was honoured by the\r\npresence of her Majesty and the Prince Consort.\r\n\r\nThe town of Hatfield presents few objects of antiquity; it stands\r\non the side of a hill, on the height of which are the gates of the\r\nmansion. Close at hand is the parish church, a structure with little\r\npretence to architectural beauty.\r\n\r\nWe may not omit to mention that at the termination of the grounds runs\r\nthe clear and beautiful river Lee—here of considerable depth. There is\r\nno bridge to cross to the other side, where are the kitchen gardens of\r\nthe house, but a ferry-boat is always at hand.\r\n\r\nOn a steep above the river is the yew-tree walk—a series of pathways\r\nbordered by the venerable trees, dwarfed generally, but producing a\r\nmost agreeable effect.\r\n\r\nIn all respects, therefore, Hatfield House is largely gifted by Nature\r\nas well as Art.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCASSIOBURY.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASSIOBURY, or Cashiobury, as it is sometimes spelt, lies about a mile\r\ndistant from Watford, in Hertfordshire. It is, therefore, within easy\r\ndistance—sixteen miles—from London, and may be considered as one\r\nof the breathing places of denizens of the Metropolis. The name of\r\nCassiobury is said, and with reason to be derived from the Casii, a\r\ntribe of the Britons who occupied the district, and whose stronghold,\r\nVerulamium, lies only a few miles away. The Casii were, at the time\r\nof the landing of Julius Cæsar, commanded by Cassivelanus, under whom\r\nthey fought many battles with the invaders. The hundred is still called\r\nthe hundred of Cassio, and the affix of _bury_ evidently signifies an\r\nassemblage of dwellings surrounded by walls, or a burgh or borough.\r\n“Being as its name implies, the only _bury_ within the manor of Cassio\r\nduring the Saxon era, it might have been either the seat of justice\r\nfor the hundred (for the name _bury_ will admit of this construction),\r\nor an occasional retreat of some of the British princes residing at\r\nVerulamium, of whom Cassivelanus was one,” and by some writers it is\r\nstated to have been “the actual seat or home of Cassivelanus.”\r\n\r\nUnder the Saxons the manor of Cassio was, it has been stated, among the\r\nnumerous possessions of Offa with which he endowed the Abbey of St.\r\nAlbans, and it remained attached to that abbey until the dissolution of\r\nthe religious houses by Henry VIII. In Domesday Book it is stated that\r\n“the Abbot of St. Albans holds Cassiou; it answers for twenty hides; of\r\nthese the abbot holds nineteen. There is land for twenty-two ploughs.\r\nSix hides are in demesne, and there are five ploughs, and a sixth\r\nmay yet be made. Three foreigners and thirty-six villeins with eight\r\nbordars have there fifteen ploughs, and one may yet be made. There\r\nare, moreover, three bordars and two bondmen, and four mills of 26_s._\r\n8_d._ Meadow for twenty-two ploughs. Pasture for the cattle. Pannage\r\nfor 1,000 hogs. Its whole value is £28; when received £24; and in King\r\nEdward’s time £30. St. Alban held and holds this manor in demesne.”\r\nIn the twelfth century the revenue duties payable from Cassio to the\r\nabbey were, at Christmas 2_s._ and twenty-four hens; at Easter, 2_s._\r\nand 600 eggs; and on St. Alban’s day, 2_s._ and twenty-four cheeses.\r\nBy Henry I. the whole liberty of Cassio was formally made over to the\r\nabbey. In 1546, after the dissolution of the monasteries, “the lordship\r\nor manor of Cayshobury” and other places was granted to Sir Richard\r\nMorrison, Knight, in consideration of certain property in Yorkshire\r\nand Worcestershire, and of the sum of £176 17_s._ 6_d._ in money; to\r\nhold the same by the service of the tenth part of a knight, and paying\r\nfor the same yearly £5 12_s._ 6½_d._ Soon after this, Sir Richard\r\ncommenced the erection of “a fayre and large house, situated upon a dry\r\nhill not far from a pleasant river in a fayre park, and had prepared\r\nmaterials for the finishing thereof; but before the same could be half\r\nbuilt, he was forced to fly beyond the seas.” The mansion was completed\r\nby his son, Sir Charles Morrison, who died in 1599. On the marriage of\r\nElizabeth Morrison, the only surviving child of Sir Richard’s grandson,\r\nthe property passed to her husband, Arthur Capel, created Baron Capel\r\nof Hadham in 1641, from whom the present possessor, the Earl of Essex,\r\nis lineally descended. Baron Capel appears to have resided more at\r\nHadham than at Cassiobury, but his son, Arthur Capel, created Viscount\r\nMalden and Earl of Essex in 1661, after residing there for a time, took\r\nup his residence at Cassiobury, the greater part of which he is said to\r\nhave rebuilt—indeed, it is said that the whole of the mansion, with\r\nthe exception of the north-west wing, was rebuilt by him, employing for\r\nthe house May, the architect, and for the laying out of his gardens\r\nMoses Cooke—who in 1675 published a volume on fruit-trees—and, it is\r\nalso said, Le Notre, and Rose, his head-gardener at Essex House, in the\r\nStrand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Back View._]\r\n\r\nOf the house and its gardens, Evelyn, on the 16th April, 1680, thus\r\nwrote:—“On the earnest invitation of the Earl of Essex, I went with\r\nhim to his house at Cassioberie in Hartfordshire. It was on Sunday, but\r\ngoing early from his house in the square of St. James’s, we arrived\r\nby ten o’clock; this we thought too late to go to church, and we had\r\nprayers in his chapell. The house is new, a plaine fabric built by\r\nmy friend Mr. Hugh May. There are divers faire and good roomes, and\r\nexcellent carving by Gibbons, especially the chimney-piece of ye\r\nlibrary. There is in the porch or entrance a painting by Verrio, of\r\n‘Apollo and the Liberal Arts.’ One room parquetted with yew which\r\nI lik’d well. Some of the chimney-mantles are of Irish marble,\r\nbrought by my lord from Ireland, when he was Lord-Lieutenant, and\r\nnot much inferior to Italian. The tympanum or gable at the front is\r\na _basso-relievo_ of Diana hunting, cut in Portland stone handsomely\r\nenough. I did not approve of the middle dores being round, but when the\r\nHall is finished as design’d, it being an oval with a cupola, together\r\nwith the other wing, it will be a very noble palace. The library is\r\nlarge, and very nobly finished, and all the books are richly bound\r\nand gilded; but there are no MSS. except the parliament rolls and\r\njournals, the transcribing and binding of which cost him, as he assured\r\nme, £500. No man has been more industrious than this noble lord in\r\nplanting about his seat, adorned with walkes, ponds, and other rural\r\nelegancies; but the soile is stonie, churlish, and uneven, nor is the\r\nwater neere enough to the house, though a very swift and cleare streame\r\nrun within a flight shot from it in the valley, which may be fitly\r\ncall’d Coldbrook, it being indeed excessive cold, yet producing fair\r\ntroutes. ‘Tis pitty the house was not situated to more advantage, but\r\nit seems it was built just where the old one was, which, I believe, he\r\nonlley meant to repaire; this leads men into irremediable errors, and\r\nsaves but a little. The land about it is exceedingly addicted to wood,\r\nbut the coldnesse of the place hinders the growth. Black cherry-trees\r\nprosper even to considerable timber, some being 80 foote long; they\r\nmake alsoe very handsome avenues. There is a pretty oval at the end of\r\na faire walke, set about with treble rows of Spanish chesnut-trees. The\r\ngardens are very rare, and cannot be otherwise, having so skilful an\r\nartist to govern them as Mr. Cooke, who is, as to ye mechanick part,\r\nnot ignorant in mathematiks, and portends to astrologie. There is an\r\nexcellent collection of the choicest fruit.”\r\n\r\nBy the second Earl of Essex the gardens were altered and improved; and\r\nit is said that those of the old mansion of the Morrisons which had\r\nnot been reconstructed by the first earl, were restored or rebuilt by\r\nhim. With the exception of these alterations and a few other occasional\r\nrepairs, the house remained as it was left by the first Earl of Essex,\r\nuntil the beginning of the nineteenth century, when the greater part\r\nwas again rebuilt by the late earl, from the designs of James Wyatt.\r\n\r\nWe now proceed to speak of the families of Morrison and Capel, to whom\r\nCassiobury has successively belonged.\r\n\r\nWilliam Morrison, or Morysine, in the reign of Henry VI. resided at\r\nChardwell, Yorkshire, and it was his grandson, Thomas Morrison, of\r\nChardwell, son of William Morrison by a daughter of Roger Leigh,\r\nof Preston, who removed into Hertfordshire. He married a daughter\r\nof Thomas Merry, of Hatfield, by whom he had a son, Sir Richard\r\nMorrison, who, in 1537, succeeded Cardinal Pole in the prebend of\r\nYatsminster-Seconda in Salisbury Cathedral. In 1539 he was appointed\r\nby Henry VIII. ambassador to Charles V., Emperor of Germany, in which\r\nhe was accompanied by Roger Ascham, and, in 1546, had a grant of the\r\nmanor of Cashiobury, and soon after commenced building there a mansion\r\nof considerable size. Besides Cashiobury he had grants, and acquired\r\nmuch property, in London, Wiltshire, Hampshire, and Somersetshire.\r\nUnder Queen Mary and her persecutions Sir Richard was compelled to fly\r\nfrom England, and died at Strasburg in 1556. He married Bridget Hussey,\r\ndaughter of Lord Hussey (who, after his death, married successively\r\nHenry, second Earl of Rutland, and Francis, third Earl of Bedford),\r\nby whom he had issue one son, Sir Charles Morrison, Knight, and three\r\ndaughters, Elizabeth, married first to Henry Norris, son of Lord\r\nNorris, of Rycote, and secondly to Henry, second Earl of Lincoln;\r\nMary, married to Bartholomew Hales, of Chesterfield; and Jane Sibilla,\r\nmarried, first to Edward, Lord Russell, and, second, to Arthur, Lord\r\nGrey, of Wilton. Sir Charles Morrison, who was knighted by Queen\r\nElizabeth, and was a minor at the time of his father’s death, married\r\nDorothy, daughter of Nicholas Clarke, and widow of Henry Long, of\r\nShengie, and by her had issue a son, Sir Charles Morrison, and three\r\ndaughters, Bridgett, married to Robert, fifth Earl of Sussex, and\r\nElizabeth and Catherine, who died unmarried. This second Sir Charles,\r\nwho succeeded his father in 1599, and was then a minor, was created\r\na baronet by letters patent, June 29, 1611, and on the coronation\r\nof Charles I. was installed a Knight of the Bath. He married Mary,\r\ndaughter and co-heiress of Baptist, Lord Hicks and Viscount Campden\r\n(the lady afterwards married successively Sir John Cooper, Bart.,\r\nand Sir Richard Alford, Knight), and by her had issue two sons, who\r\ndied young, and a daughter, Elizabeth Morrison, who thus became his\r\nonly heir. This lady, Elizabeth Morrison, married Arthur Capel, who,\r\nby letters patent, dated August 6, 1641, was created Baron Capel, of\r\nHadham, and thus the large estates of the Morrisons, both at Cashiobury\r\nand elsewhere, passed into the family of Capel, its present holders.\r\nThe arms of Morrison were, _or_, on a chief, _gules_, three chaplets of\r\nthe first. Crest, specially conferred on Sir Richard, in allusion to\r\nhis literary attainments, a Pegasus rising, _or_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From the Wood Walks._]\r\n\r\nThe noble family of Capel to whom Cassiobury, as has been stated,\r\npassed by marriage with the heiress of Morrison, and to whom it\r\nstill belongs, is of considerable antiquity, and few families have\r\nbeen enriched by so many scions of brilliant intellect. The family\r\nappears to have been originally of Capel’s Moan, hear Stoke Neyland,\r\nin Suffolk, and here, in 1261, resided Sir Richard de Capel, Lord\r\nJustice of Ireland: in 1368, Lionel, Duke of Clarence, son of Edward\r\nIII., left by will “to John de Capell, my chaplain, a girdle of gold,\r\nto make a chalice in memory of my soul.” Later on another John Capel,\r\nwho died in 1441, left, by his wife, Joan, besides a son, John, a\r\nsecond son, William Capel, who was a draper and citizen of London,\r\n“and successively alderman, sheriff, representative of the city in\r\nParliament, and lord mayor, and had the honour of knighthood conferred\r\non him by Henry VII.” He was twice lord mayor, and several times M.P.\r\nof the city. He died in 1515, and “was buried in a chapel founded by\r\nhimself on the south side of the church of St. Bartholomew, near the\r\nRoyal Exchange, London.” He also gave his name to Capel Court. He\r\nmarried Margaret, daughter of Sir Thomas Arundell, of Lanhorne, by\r\nwhom, besides two daughters, he had a son, Sir Giles Capel, Knight, who\r\nsucceeded him, and married, first, Mary, daughter of Richard Roos, son\r\nof Lord Roos, and, secondly, Isabel, daughter of Sir Thomas Newton, by\r\nwhom he had issue a daughter, and two sons, Sir Henry and Sir Edward.\r\nSir Henry Capel married Anne, daughter of Lord Roos, and granddaughter\r\nof the Duchess of Exeter, sister to King Edward IV.: he died without\r\nsurviving issue, and was succeeded by his brother, Sir Edward Capel,\r\nwhose wife was Anne, daughter of Sir William Pelham, ancestor of the\r\nDukes of Newcastle; he, dying in 1577, was succeeded by his eldest son.\r\nSir Henry Capel, Knight, who, by his second wife, Catherine, daughter\r\nof Thomas, Earl of Rutland, had, besides several others, a son, Sir\r\nArthur Capel, Knight, who succeeded him, and was in turn succeeded by\r\nhis son, Sir Henry Capel. This gentleman, who, like many of his family,\r\nhad been Sheriff of Herts, married twice. By his first wife, Theodosia,\r\ndaughter of Sir Edward Montagne, he had issue, besides others, a son,\r\nArthur Capel, who was a minor at the time of his death.\r\n\r\nArthur Capel was born about the year 1614, and, both his parents dying\r\nwhen he was young, he was brought up by his grandfather, Sir Arthur.\r\nHe espoused the royal cause in the troublous times of Charles I., and\r\nbecame one of his most valued and zealous adherents. He was rewarded\r\nwith a peerage, being created Baron Capel of Hadham, the king in\r\ndesiring this reward having written to the Queen, “there is one that\r\ndoth not yet pretend, that deserves as well as any; I mean Capel;\r\ntherefore I desire thy assistance to find out something for him before\r\nhe ask.” After taking an active part in support and defence of the\r\nking, Lord Capel was imprisoned in the Tower, and on the 9th of March,\r\n1649, he was beheaded before the great gate of Westminster Hall. “His\r\nbody was buried at Little Hadham, with an inscription stating him to\r\nhave been murdered for his loyalty to King Charles I.; and his heart,\r\naccording to a wish he had expressed to Bishop Morley, was enclosed\r\nin a silver cup and cover, to be eventually buried at the feet of the\r\nmaster whom he had so zealously served. But no funeral rites being\r\nperformed to the memory of Charles I., the cup was kept in a press at\r\nHadham, where it was discovered in 1703, and its contents placed in the\r\nfamily vault.” It was this Lord Capel who, before his elevation to the\r\npeerage, had married Elizabeth Morrison, and so acquired Cassiobury\r\nand the rest of the large possessions of the Morrison family. The\r\nissue of this marriage was four sons and four daughters, viz., Arthur,\r\nwho succeeded his father; Sir Henry Capel, created Baron Capel of\r\nTewkesbury; Charles and Edward, who died unmarried; Mary, married,\r\nfirst, to Lord Beauchamp, and, secondly, to Henry, Duke of Beaufort;\r\nElizabeth, married to the Earl of Carnarvon; Theodosia, wife of the\r\nEarl of Clarendon; and Anne, of John Strangeways.\r\n\r\nArthur, second Baron Capel, was, in 1601, created Viscount Maiden and\r\nEarl of Essex, and in 1670 was appointed ambassador to the court of\r\nDenmark. He it was who, as has already been stated, rebuilt Cassiobury,\r\nand formed its beautiful gardens. In 1683 his lordship was apprehended\r\nat Cassiobury on a charge of being concerned in the famous “Rye House\r\nPlot,” and was committed to the Tower, where he was, as is believed,\r\nfoully murdered, or at all events, where he was found dead with his\r\nthroat cut. The earl married Elizabeth, only daughter of Algernon\r\nPercy, Earl of Northumberland, by whom he had six sons and two\r\ndaughters, most of whom dying young, he was at his death succeeded by\r\nhis fifth son, Algernon Capel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From the South West._]\r\n\r\nAlgernon, second Earl of Essex, was Gentleman of the Bed-chamber\r\nto King William III., and held important offices under Queen Anne.\r\nHe married Mary, daughter of the Earl of Portland, by whom he had\r\nissue two daughters and one son, William Capel, who succeeded him as\r\nthird Earl of Essex. This Earl married twice, and had, by his first\r\nwife, Jane, daughter of the Earl of Clarendon, four daughters; and\r\nby his second wife, Elizabeth, daughter of the Duke of Bedford, four\r\ndaughters, and one son, by whom he was succeeded. This was—\r\n\r\nWilliam Anne Holles Capel, fourth Earl of Essex, one of the Lords of\r\nthe Bed-chamber to George II. and George III., and Lord-Lieutenant of\r\nHertfordshire. He married Frances, daughter of Sir Charles Hanbury\r\nWilliams, Bart., by whom he acquired the estate of Hampton Court,\r\nHerefordshire, which was afterwards sold to Richard Arkwright, Esq.,\r\nof Cromford, Derbyshire, and by her had issue two daughters, and\r\na son, George Capel, who succeeded him, in 1759, as fifth Earl of\r\nEssex; and, secondly, Harriet, daughter of Colonel Thomas Bladen, by\r\nwhom he had issue five sons, viz., one who died young; John Thomas,\r\nwhose son succeeded to the title and estates as sixth Earl of Essex;\r\nLieut.-General Thomas Edward Capel; Hon. and Rev. William Robert Capel,\r\nchaplain to the King; and Rear-Admiral the Hon. Bladen Thomas Capel.\r\nHis lordship died in 1799, and was succeeded by his son, George Capel,\r\nwho, having succeeded to the estates of his maternal grandmother,\r\nassumed the name of Coningsby, and became George Capel-Coningsby, fifth\r\nEarl of Essex, Viscount Malden, and sixth Baron Capel. His lordship\r\nmarried twice, first, in 1786, Sarah, daughter of Henry Bazett, Esq.,\r\nof St. Helena, and widow of Edward Stephenson, Esq.; and secondly,\r\nin 1838, Catherine, daughter of Mr. E. Stephens, but had no issue by\r\neither marriage. His lordship died in 1839, and was succeeded in his\r\ntitle and estates by his nephew, Arthur Algernon Capel, the son of his\r\nhalf-brother, the Hon. John Thomas Capel.\r\n\r\nArthur Algernon Capel, sixth Earl of Essex and Viscount Malden, and\r\nseventh Baron Capel of Hadham, was born January 28th, 1803. In 1825 he\r\nmarried the Lady Caroline Jeanetta Beauclerk, third daughter of the\r\neighth Duke of St. Albans, and by her, who died in 1862, had issue:\r\nArthur De Vere Capel, Viscount Malden, born 1826 (heir to the title\r\nand estate, who married, in 1853, Emma Martha, daughter of Sir Henry\r\nMeux, Bart., and has issue), the Hon. Adela Caroline Harriet Capel, now\r\ndeceased, married to the Earl of Eglintoun; the Hon. Reginald Algernon\r\nCapel, married to Mary, daughter of John Nicholas Fazkerly, Esq., and\r\nniece of the Earl of Rokeby; and the Hon. Randolph Capel. In 1863, his\r\nlordship married, secondly, the Lady Louisa Caroline Elizabeth Boyle,\r\ndaughter of Viscountess Dungarvon, and sister to the Earl of Cork, and\r\nby her has issue living, the Hon. Arthur Algernon Capel, born 1864,\r\nand the Hon. Beatrice Mary, born 1870. His lordship is patron of the\r\nlivings of Watford, in Hertfordshire, Rayne, in Essex, and Shuttington,\r\nin Warwickshire.\r\n\r\nThe arms of the Earl of Essex are—_Gules_, a lion rampant between\r\nthree cross-crosslets fitchée, _or_; crest, a demi-lion rampant\r\nsupporting a cross-crosslet fitchée, _or_; supporters, two lions, _or_,\r\nducally crowned, _gules_; motto, “Fide et Fortitudine.”\r\n\r\nThe park of Cassiobury embraces an area of nearly seven hundred acres,\r\nof which more than three hundred and fifty are called “the Home Park,”\r\nand about two hundred and fifty the “Upper Park;” they are separated\r\nfrom each other by the river Gade, which flows between them. The\r\nremainder of the ground is divided into woods, lawns, gardens, and all\r\nthe other elegancies of grounds around the house, the site of which is\r\nalso included in it. The parks are well wooded with majestic trees,\r\namong which are a profusion of beech, oak, elm, and fir—some of the\r\nlatter resembling in their enormous size those of Norway. Several of\r\nthe beech-trees, too, are of gigantic size, some being said to cover an\r\narea of ground nearly 150 feet in diameter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Swiss Cottage._]\r\n\r\nThe present mansion was built from the designs of Mr. James Wyatt,\r\nat that time the fashionable architect of Fonthill Abbey, of parts\r\nof Windsor Castle, and other places: it is of that peculiar style of\r\nGothic architecture which characterizes most buildings erected by him.\r\nThe general plan is a square; the building surrounding a court-yard or\r\nquadrangle, with a cloister on two of its sides; the entrance being\r\nto the west, the chief room to the south, the private or family rooms\r\nto the east, and the kitchen, servants’ offices, &c., to the north. A\r\nporch screens the entrance-doorway, that opens into a narrow cloister,\r\non the right of which is a small vestibule and enclosed staircase.\r\nEastward of these is the great cloister, having five windows, partly of\r\nstained glass, and its walls adorned with full-length family portraits\r\nand other paintings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Lodge._]\r\n\r\nBranching off from the cloisters is the SALOON, placed between the\r\ndining and drawing-rooms. “Its ceiling is adorned with the painting\r\nEvelyn mentions as belonging to the hall of the old mansion, and to\r\nhave been the work of Verrio, the subject being composed chiefly of\r\nallegorical figures—Painting, Sculpture, Music, and War. In this\r\napartment are two cabinets, containing numerous miniatures painted by\r\nthe Countess of Essex,” and many family and other portraits.\r\n\r\nIn the DINING-ROOM, which is a noble apartment, with wainscoted\r\nwalls, also hang several remarkably fine family and other portraits,\r\nby Vandyke, Hoppner, and other painters; and several fine\r\npictures,—notably, “The Cat’s Paw,” by Landseer, and “The Highlander’s\r\nHome,” by Wilkie.\r\n\r\nThe GRAND DRAWING-ROOM, which is filled with all the elegancies and\r\nluxuries of the most refined taste, and with the choicest cabinets, is\r\nadorned with paintings by Turner, Callcott, Collins, and others. These\r\nare of the highest order—rare and beautiful examples of the great\r\nEnglish masters in art. Adjoining the drawing-room is the conservatory\r\ncloister, which is entered both from it and from the library.\r\n\r\nThe LIBRARY, which occupies four rooms,—respectively known as the\r\nGreat Library, the Inner Library, the Dramatists’ Library, and the\r\nSmall Library,—is remarkably extensive; and contains, as such a\r\nlibrary ought, a rare collection of valuable books in every class of\r\nliterature. In these various rooms is preserved a fine collection of\r\nfamily paintings; and here, too, will be seen some of Grinling Gibbon’s\r\nmatchless carvings, which are noticed by Evelyn as being there in\r\nhis day. Among the historical relics preserved in the Library is the\r\nhandkerchief which Lord Coningsby applied to the shoulder of King\r\nWilliam III., when that monarch was wounded, in 1690, at the battle\r\nof the Boyne. It is stained with the blood of the king. There is also\r\nhere a piece of the velvet pall of Charles I., taken from the tomb at\r\nWindsor, when it was opened in 1813, with a fragment of the Garter worn\r\nby the king at his execution.\r\n\r\nLike these, the other apartments at Cassiobury are filled with choice\r\npaintings and with everything that good taste and a lavish hand can\r\nsuggest. The family portraits are, as might be expected, numerous,\r\nand of the highest order of art, several are by Vandyke, Cornelius\r\nJansen, Sir Peter Lely, Sir Joshua Reynolds, and other famous artists.\r\nThroughout the rooms are scattered admirable works by Rembrandt, Cuyp,\r\nTeniers, &c., &c.\r\n\r\nWe have made but brief reference to the gardens and grounds, and\r\nscarcely noticed the spacious and very beautiful Park. They are charms\r\nthat neither lofty descent nor large wealth could purchase—the\r\nbequests only of Time. Centuries have passed since some of these\r\nmagnificent trees were planted. The house is best seen from one of the\r\nhigh steeps on the opposite side of the river that runs through the\r\ndemesne; lines of venerable chestnuts border a greensward that extends\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nHere and there glimpses are caught of the mansion, made by distance\r\nmore picturesque than it is at a nearer range. In fact, there is at\r\nCassiobury the happy combination of grandeur and beauty, natural grace\r\nin association with rich cultivation, that makes so many of the Stately\r\nHomes of England the boast and glory of the country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _In the Church at Watford._]\r\n\r\nThe family burial-place of the Morrison and Capel families of\r\nCassiobury is at Watford, where a fine monumental chapel exists in\r\nthe parish church. This chapel “contains sepulchral memorials to the\r\nMorrison and Capel families, from that of Lady Morrison, wife of Sir\r\nRichard Morrison, who directed the chapel to be built in 1595.” In\r\nthe centre is an altar-tomb, supported upon six pillars, of various\r\ncoloured marbles, on which rests the recumbent figure of “Lady Bridget,\r\nCountess of Bedford”—the lady by whom the chapel was founded—and\r\ndaughter of Lord Hussey. She died in 1600.\r\n\r\nOn the south side “is a large and gorgeous monument to Sir Charles\r\nMorrison the elder, whose effigy, in armour, in a reclining posture,\r\nis placed under the canopy.” On either side of the tomb, in kneeling\r\npositions upon pedestals, are figures of the son and daughter of Sir\r\nCharles Morrison, and Bridget Morrison, Countess of Sussex. This work\r\nwas executed by Nicholas Stone, in 1619, who agreed with Sir Charles\r\nto make “a tomb of alabaster and touchstone,” and whose entry in his\r\nnote-book as to price is very curious. He says he made it with “one\r\npictor of white marble for his father, and his own, and his sister, the\r\nCountess of Sesex, as great as the life, of alabaster, for the which I\r\nhad well payed £260, and four pieces given to drinke.”\r\n\r\nOn the opposite side of the chapel is another large monument to the\r\nsecond Sir Charles Morrison, designed and executed by the same “carver\r\nand tomb-maker,” as he is termed in the contract, and for which he\r\nagreed with the widow to receive £400. There are also several other\r\ninteresting monuments and monumental slabs; the chapel is hung with\r\nbanners and hatchments.\r\n\r\nAt this time, the church is undergoing thorough repair and restoration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHATSWORTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Entrance to the Stables._]\r\n\r\nCHATSWORTH, the “Palace of the Peak,” perhaps more than any other house\r\nin England, merits its proud distinction as a “STATELY HOME.” Situated\r\nin the most beautiful district of Derbyshire; possessing many natural\r\nadvantages within the circuit of its domain—of hill and valley, wood\r\nand water, rugged rock and verdant plain, and rendered attractive by\r\nevery means the most poetic imagination could conceive and unbounded\r\nwealth accomplish, it is foremost among the finest and most charming\r\nseats in the kingdom; where the delights of natural beauty, aided\r\nby Art, may be fully and freely enjoyed by all comers. Belonging to\r\nhis Grace the Duke of Devonshire—one of the most enlightened and\r\nliberal-minded of our English aristocracy—Chatsworth, with its park\r\nand grounds, is thrown open to “the people,” under such restrictions\r\nonly as are essentially necessary to its well-being and proper\r\nconservation. Assuredly no mansion and grounds are more freely and\r\nliberally made available to the public, while none are more worthy of\r\nbeing visited. It will be our task, therefore, to endeavour to describe\r\nseveral of its beauties and attractions, and to unfold and spread out\r\nbefore our readers some of the rich treasures of Nature and of Art it\r\ncontains.\r\n\r\nAnd, first, a few words on its geographical position and history.\r\n\r\nChatsworth lies in the parish of Edensor, in the hundred of High Peak,\r\nin the county of Derby. It is three miles from the Midland Railway\r\nStation at Rowsley (of which we have spoken in our account of Haddon\r\nHall, and which is the most convenient station for visitors from the\r\nsouth), three-and-a-half miles from Bakewell (where there is a station\r\nconvenient for visitors from the north) two from Baslow, twenty-six\r\nfrom Derby, ten from Matlock Bath, nine from Chesterfield, twelve from\r\nSheffield, fourteen from Buxton, thirty-seven from Manchester, and\r\nabout one hundred and fifty-four from London. The railway stations\r\nfrom which Chatsworth is best reached are, as just stated, Rowsley\r\nand Bakewell; the line from London and the south to the former\r\npassing through Derby, Duffield, Belper, Ambergate (where the lines\r\nfrom Sheffield, Leeds, York, and the north join in), Whatstandwell,\r\nCromford, Matlock Bath, Matlock Bridge, and Darley Dale; and to the\r\nlatter from Manchester and Buxton, passing Miller’s Dale, Monsal Dale,\r\nLongstone, and Hassop.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the Domesday Survey of William the Conqueror, Chatsworth\r\nbelonged to the Crown, and was held by William Peverel, the entry\r\nbeing as follows: “In Langlie and Chetesuorde, Leuenot and Chetel\r\nhad ten ox-gangs of land for geld [land for ten oxen]. This belonged\r\nto Ednesoure. William Pevrel keeps them for the king. Five villanes\r\nand two bordars have two ploughs and one acre of meadow there. Wood,\r\npasturable, one mile in length and one in breadth, and a little\r\nunderwood. In the time of King Edward it was worth twenty shillings;\r\nnow, sixteen shillings.” The name of _Chetesuorde_, now altered into\r\nChatsworth, was doubtless originally _Chetelsuorde_, from the name\r\nof one of its Saxon owners, Chetel. After the Peverels, the manor of\r\nChatsworth was held by the family of Leche, who had long been settled\r\nthere before they became possessed of the manor, and who held it for\r\nseveral generations. In the reign of Edward III. one member of this\r\nfamily, John Leche, of Chatsworth, whose father is said to have been\r\nof Carden (a line continued by a younger son), was one of the surgeons\r\nto the king. In the reign of Henry IV. Sir Roger Leche, knight, held,\r\namong other property, lands at Glossop. They also held, among others,\r\nthe manors of Totley. Shipley, Willersley, Cromford, and the prebendal\r\nmanor of Sawley. John Leche, surgeon to Edward III., was, it appears,\r\ngrantee of Castle Warin and other lands, and had a son, Daniel Leche,\r\nwhose son, John Leche, married Lucy de Cawarden, and thus became\r\npossessed of the manor of Carden. The family of Leche of Chatsworth\r\nbecame extinct in the reign of Edward VI., by the death of Francis\r\nLeche, who had, however, previously sold this manor to the Agards. One\r\nof the co-heiresses of Ralph Leche, of Chatsworth, uncle to Francis,\r\nmarried Thomas Kniveton, of Mercaston, father of Sir William and\r\ngrandfather of Sir Gilbert Kniveton; another married a Wingfield, and\r\nthe third espoused Slater, of Sutton, in the county of Lincoln. Francis\r\nLeche, to whom we have referred, married Alice, daughter of John\r\nHardwick, of Hardwick, by his wife Elizabeth, daughter of John Leake,\r\nof Hasland, a branch of the Leakes, Earls of Scarsdale. This Alice, on\r\nthe death of her only brother, John Hardwick, without issue, became\r\none of his co-heiresses, with her three sisters—Mary, who married,\r\nfirst, Wingfield, and, second, Pollard, of Devonshire; Jane, married to\r\nGodfrey Bosville, of Gunthwaite; and Elizabeth, better known as “Bess\r\nof Hardwick,” who married, first, Robert Barley, of Barley—second, Sir\r\nWilliam Cavendish—third, Sir William St. Loe—and fourth, Gilbert,\r\nfourth Earl of Shrewsbury. This Francis Leche, as has just been\r\nstated, sold the manor and estates of Chatsworth to Agard, who shortly\r\nafterwards resold it to Sir William Cavendish, the husband of “Bess of\r\nHardwick,” and, consequently, the brother-in-law of Alice Leche.\r\n\r\nThe family of Agard is of very ancient origin in the county of Derby,\r\nbeing settled at Foston as early as 1310. In the reign of Charles II.\r\nthe Foston estate was sold by John Agard, and about the same time,\r\none of the co-heiresses of Charles Agard, the last heir-male of the\r\nmain line, married John Stanhope, of Elvaston, the ancestor of the\r\nEarls of Harrington. Another branch of the Agards settled at Sudbury,\r\nin the same county, and one of them married the heiress of Ferrars,\r\nof Tamworth. The Agards, as feodaries or bailiffs of the honour of\r\nTutbury, were possessed of a horn (described in the “Archæologia”)\r\nwhich passed, with the office, to Charles Stanhope, Esq., of Elvaston,\r\non his marriage with the heiress. Arthur Agard, born at Foston, in\r\n1540, was an able and eminent antiquary, and was one of the members of\r\nthe first Society of Antiquaries. His essays read to the Society occur\r\nin Hearne’s “Discourses,” and a treatise by him on the obscure words\r\nin Domesday-book, are, with other papers, in the Cottonian Collection\r\nin the British Museum. He held office as Deputy-Chamberlain of the\r\nExchequer, and died in 1615. A John Agard founded a chantry at Lupton.\r\n\r\nShortly after acquiring Chatsworth by purchase from the Agards, Sir\r\nWilliam Cavendish pulled down the old Hall of the Leches, and began the\r\nerection of the mansion which, in a few years after its construction,\r\nwas destined to become a place of historical interest. Sir William\r\nCavendish, it appears, died before his plans for building had been\r\ncarried out to any great extent; and its completion, on a much larger\r\nscale than he had intended, was left to his widow (who ultimately\r\nbecame Countess of Shrewsbury), by whom Hardwick Hall and other places\r\nwere erected; and of whom it was said that, having a firm belief she\r\nshould never die so long as she continued building, kept on year after\r\nyear; until at last, a terrible frost coming on, the masons were thrown\r\nout of work, when she languished and died. The mansion, commenced by\r\nSir William Cavendish, and completed by his widow, was a quadrangular\r\nbuilding, the west front of which had a square tower at each end,\r\nand the entrance, in the centre, was between four angular towers. Of\r\nthis front of the building a representation is happily preserved at\r\nChatsworth, which, through the kindness and courtesy of its noble\r\nowner, the present Duke of Devonshire, we are enabled to engrave.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Old Hall as it formerly stood._]\r\n\r\nIt was in this mansion that that truly unhappy sovereign, Mary, Queen\r\nof Scots, was kept so long a prisoner under the care of the Earl of\r\nShrewsbury—the suite of rooms occupied by her being on the upper, or\r\nstate-room story, of the east side of the quadrangle, and immediately\r\nopposite to the then principal entrance. The unfortunate queen was\r\nfirst brought captive to Chatsworth in May or June, 1570, from Tutbury\r\nCastle, probably spending a short time on her way at another of the\r\nearl’s residences, Wingfield Manor: here she remained for some months,\r\nand here, it is pleasant to know, the severity of her confinement was\r\nin some degree relaxed; yet the surveillance kept over her by the Earl\r\nof Shrewsbury was enough to disappoint a scheme laid for her release\r\nby two sons of the Earl of Derby, and a Derbyshire gentleman named\r\nHall. At this time the Queen of Scots’ establishment consisted of\r\nthirty persons, among whom was John Beton, a member of the same family\r\nto which Cardinal Beton belonged. This faithful servant, who was her\r\n“prægustator”—an office in royal households of which frequent mention\r\nis made in the old writers of the Middle Ages—died while Mary was in\r\ncaptivity at Chatsworth, and was buried in the church of Edensor, close\r\nby, where a monument, which yet remains, was erected by his attached\r\nmistress. Of this monument we shall give an engraving later on. During\r\nthis same year at Chatsworth it was that the series of personal\r\nnegotiations which kept hope alive in the breast of the fair captive\r\nwas commenced, and in which Cecil and Mildmay, who were at Chatsworth\r\nin October, took part. At this time the project of removing her to\r\nSheffield was mooted, and on his return to court from Chatsworth, Cecil\r\nwrote his memorable letter, allowing her a little horse-exercise about\r\nthe grounds of Chatsworth.\r\n\r\n “Now for the removing of yt quene, hir Maty said at the first that she\r\n trusted so to make an end in short tyme yt your L. shuld be shortly\r\n ac’qted of hir; nevertheless when I told her Maty that yow cold not\r\n long indure your howshold there for lack of fewell and other thyngs,\r\n and yt I thought Tutbury not so fitt a place as it was supposed, but\r\n yt Sheffield was ye metest, hir Maty sayd she wold thynk of it, and\r\n wtin few dayes gyve me knolledg: Only I see her Maty loth to have\r\n yt Q. to be often removed, supposying that therby she cometh to new\r\n acqueyntance; but to that I sayd Yor L. cold remove hir wtout callying\r\n any to you but your owne. Uponn motiō made by me, at the B. of Ross’s\r\n request, the Q. Maty is pleased yt your L. shall, whan yow see tymes\r\n mete, suffer ye Quene to take ye ayre about your howss on horssback,\r\n so your L. be in copany; and therein I am sure your L. will have good\r\n respect to your owne company, to be suer and trusty; and not to pass\r\n fro yowr howss above one or twoo myle, except it be on ye moores; for\r\n I never feare any other practise of strangers as long as ther be no\r\n corruptiō amongst your owne.”\r\n\r\nThis letter was followed by another, giving the irate queen’s promise\r\nto remove Mary to Sheffield, whither she was taken a little before\r\nChristmas. The orders for the government of the household of the\r\ncaptive queen after her removal were so stringent and curious that\r\nthey will, no doubt, be read with interest. The original document is\r\npreserved in the Cottonian Library in the British Museum. It is as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n “To the Mr of the Scotts Queene’s household, Mr Beton.\r\n\r\n “First,—That all your people wch appertayneth to the Queen shall\r\n depart from the Queen’s chamber or chambers to their own lodging at\r\n IX. of the clock at night, winter and summer, whatsoever he or she;\r\n either to their lodging within the house or without in the Towne,\r\n there to remain till the next day at VI. of the clock.\r\n\r\n “Item,—That none of the Queen’s people shall at no time wear his\r\n sword neither within the house, nor when her Grace rydeth or goeth\r\n abroade: unless the Master of the Household himself to weare a sword,\r\n and no more without my special license.\r\n\r\n “Item,—That there shall none of the Queen’s people carry any bow or\r\n shaftes, at no tyme, neither to the field nor to the butts, unless it\r\n be foure or fyve, and no more, being in the Queen’s companye.\r\n\r\n “Item,—That none of the Queen’s people shall ryde or go at no tyme\r\n abroad out of the House or towne without my special license: and if\r\n he or they so doth, they or he shall come no more in at the gates,\r\n neither in the towne, whatsoever he or she or they be.\r\n\r\n “Item,—That youe or some of the Queen’s chamber, when her Grace will\r\n walke abroad, shall advertyse the officiar of my warde who shall\r\n declare the messuage to me one houer before she goeth forth.\r\n\r\n “Item,—That none of the Queen’s people whatsoever he or they be,\r\n not once offer at no tyme to come forth of their chamber or lodging\r\n when anie alarum is given by night or daie, whether they be in the\r\n Queen’s chambers or in their chambers within the house, or without\r\n in the towne. And yf he or they keepe not their chamber or lodgings\r\n whatsoever that be, he or they shall stande at their perill for deathe.\r\n\r\n  “At Shefeild, the 26th daie of April, 1571, per me,\r\n\r\n  “SHREWSBURIE.”\r\n\r\nThese orders satisfied Elizabeth, for Cecil says:—“The Q. Maty\r\nlyketh well of all your ordres.”\r\n\r\nIt will no doubt interest our readers to be put in possession of a list\r\nof her attendants at this time. They were as follows:—\r\n\r\n  “My Lady Leinstoun, dame of honour to the quene’s Ma^{te}.\r\n  M’rez Leinstoun.\r\n  M’rez Setoun.\r\n  Maistresse Brusse.\r\n  M’rez Courcelles.\r\n  M’rez Kennett.\r\n  My Lord Leinstoun.\r\n  M^{re} Betown, mr. howshold.\r\n  M^{re} Leinstoun, gentilman servāt.\r\n  M^{re} Castel, physition.\r\n  Mr Raullett, secretaire.\r\n  Bastien, page.\r\n  Balthazar Huylly.\r\n  James Lander.\r\n  Gilbert Courll.\r\n  William Douglas.\r\n  Jaquece de Sanlie.\r\n  Archibald Betoun.\r\n  Thomas Archebald.\r\n  D—— Chiffland.\r\n  Guyon l’Oyselon.\r\n  Andro Matreson.\r\n  Estien Hauet, escuyer.\r\n  Martin Huet, m^{re} cooke.\r\n  Piere Madard, potiger.\r\n  Jhan de Boyes, pastilar.\r\n  Mr. Brusse, gentilman to my Lord Leinstoun.\r\n  Nicholl Fichar, servant to my Lady Leinstoun.\r\n  Jhon Dumfrys, servant to Maistresse Setoun.\r\n  William Blake, servant to Maistresse Courcelles, to serve in absence\r\n      of Florence.”\r\n\r\nBesides these the following supernumerary servants were kindly allowed\r\nby the earl and approved by the queen:—\r\n\r\n  “Christilie Hog, Bastiene’s wyff.\r\n  Ellen Bog, the Mr cooke’s wyff.\r\n  Cristiane Grame, my Lady Leinstoun’s gentilwoman.\r\n  Janet Lindesay, M’rez Setoun’s gentilwoman.\r\n  Jannette Spetell.\r\n  Robert Hamiltoun, to bere fyre and water to the quene’s cuysine.\r\n  Robert Ladel, the quene’s lacquay.\r\n  Gilbert Bonnar, horskeippar.\r\n  Francoys, to serve M^{re} Castel, the phesitien.”\r\n\r\nThe earl, to insure her safe-keeping, took to himself forty extra\r\nservants, chosen from his tenantry, to keep watch day and night: so\r\nthis must, indeed, have been a busy and bustling, as well as an anxious\r\ntime, at Chatsworth and at Sheffield.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1578 Mary was once more at Chatsworth, but in November\r\nwas back again, as close a prisoner as ever at Sheffield. Again in 1577\r\nshe was, for a short time, at Chatsworth, at which period the Countess\r\nof Shrewsbury was still building there. It was in this year that the\r\ncountess wrote to her husband the letter endeavouring to get him to\r\nspend the summer there, in which she uses the strange expressions,\r\n“Lette me here how you, your charge _and love_ dothe, and commende me I\r\npray you.” In 1581 Mary was again brought to Chatsworth, and probably\r\nwas there at other times than those we have indicated. In any case,\r\nthe fact of her being there kept a captive, invests the place with a\r\npowerful interest of a far different kind from any other it possesses.\r\nOne solitary remain—“Mary Queen of Scots’ Bower”—of this ill-starred\r\nsovereign’s captivity at Chatsworth now exists; to this reference will\r\nbe made later on.\r\n\r\nIt is also essential here to note, that during these troublous times,\r\nthe ill-fated Lady Arabella Stuart—the child of Charles Stuart,\r\nEarl of Lennox, and of his wife Elizabeth Cavendish, daughter of\r\nSir William Cavendish, by his wife “Bess of Hardwick”—was born at\r\nChatsworth. The beautiful, much-injured, and ill-fated Lady Arabella,\r\nwhose sole crime was that she was born a Stuart, is thus in more ways\r\nthan one, like her relative, Mary Queen of Scots, not only mixed up\r\nwith Chatsworth, but with the family of its noble possessor. The\r\nincidents of the life of this young, beautiful, and accomplished\r\nlady, which form one of the most touching episodes in our national\r\nhistory—the jealous eye with which Elizabeth looked upon her from\r\nher birth—the careful watch set over her by Cecil—the trials of\r\nRaleigh and his friends—her troubles with her aunt (Mary, Countess\r\nof Shrewsbury)—her being placed under restraint—her marriage with\r\nSeymour—her seizure, imprisonment, sufferings, and death as a hopeless\r\nlunatic in the Tower of London, where she had been thrown by her\r\ncousin, King James I., are all matters of history, and invest her\r\nshort, sad life with a melancholy interest. One of the old ballads to\r\nwhich her misfortunes gave rise, thus alludes to her connection with\r\nDerbyshire:—\r\n\r\n  “My lands and livings, so well known,\r\n    Unto your books of majesty,\r\n  Amount to twelve-score pounds a week,\r\n    Besides what I do give,” quoth she.\r\n\r\n  “In gallant Derbyshire likewise,\r\n    I nine-score beadsmen maintain there,\r\n  With hats and gowns and house-rent free,\r\n    And every man five marks a year.”\r\n\r\nDuring the civil wars the old hall of Chatsworth was taken possession\r\nof, and garrisoned, in 1643, for the Parliament by Sir John Gell,\r\nbeing then placed under the command of Captain Stafford, from whose\r\ncompany at Chatsworth in the latter part of the year, forty musqueteers\r\nwere ordered to be drafted off, and joined to the army of Fairfax\r\nfor his proposed march to Chesterfield and the North. At the end of\r\nthe same year the Earl of Newcastle’s forces having taken Wingfield\r\nManor, and other places in the county, made themselves masters of\r\nChatsworth (which had been evacuated on his approach to Chesterfield),\r\nand garrisoned it for the king under Colonel Eyre, who the following\r\nspring received reinforcements from Tissington and Bakewell. In\r\nSeptember, 1645, “the governor of Welbecke having gotten good strength\r\nby the kinges coming that way, came to Derbyshire with 300 horse and\r\ndragoones, to sett upp a garrison at Chatsworth, and one Colonel\r\nShallcross, for governor there. Colonel Gell having intelligence\r\nthereof, sent presently Major Molanus with 400 foott to repossess the\r\nhouse; and having layn theire 14 days, and hearing of the demolishinge\r\nof Welbecke, Bolsover, and Tickhill castles, was commanded by Colonel\r\nGell to return to Derby.”\r\n\r\nA little before these troublous times, in 1636, Thomas Hobbes, best\r\nknown as “Leviathan Hobbes” or “Hobbes of Malmesbury,” who, before\r\nhe was twenty years of age, became tutor to the sons of Sir William\r\nCavendish (then recently created Baron Cavendish of Hardwick), and who\r\nlived and died in the family, thus wrote of the beauty of Chatsworth,\r\nand of the nobleness of soul of its owner, his patron and friend:—\r\n\r\n  “On th’ English Alps, where Darbie’s Peak doth rise\r\n  High up in Hills that emulate the skies,\r\n  And largely waters all the Vales below\r\n  With Rivers that still plentifully flow,\r\n  Doth CHATSWORTH by swift Derwin’s Channel stand,\r\n  Fam’d for its pile, and Lord, for both are grand.\r\n  Slowly the River by its Gates doth pass,\r\n  Here silent, as in wonder of the place,\r\n  But does from rocky precipices move\r\n  In rapid streams below it; and above\r\n  A lofty Mountain guards the house behind\r\n  From the assaults of the rough eastern wind;\r\n  Which does from far its rugged Cliffs display,\r\n  And sleep prolongs by shutting out the day.\r\n  Behind, a pleasant Garden does appear:\r\n  Where the rich earth breathes odours everywhere;\r\n  Where, in the midst of Woods, the fruitful tree\r\n  Bears without prune-hook, seeming now as free;\r\n  Where, by the thick-leav’d roof, the walls are made—\r\n  Spite of the Sun where all his beams display’d—\r\n  More cool than the fam’d Virgil’s beechen shade;\r\n  Where Art (itself dissembling), rough-hewn stone\r\n  And craggy flints worn out by dropping on\r\n  (Together joyning by the workman’s tool),\r\n  Makes horrid rocks and watry caverns cool.”\r\n\r\nOf Hobbes we give an interesting and curious memoir in the present\r\nvolume, under the head of “Hardwick Hall.” Of the old house as it\r\nexisted in 1680-1, we have, fortunately, a very graphic word-picture,\r\npreserved to us in Charles Cotton’s “Wonders of the Peak;” and\r\nan admirable pictorial representation in one of Knyff’s careful\r\ndrawings, engraved by Kipp, of the same house, when the south front\r\nand other parts had been rebuilt, but the west front with its towers\r\nwas remaining entire. Cotton’s—friend and companion of Izaak\r\nWalton—description of the place is so clever and so graphic that it\r\ncannot fail to interest our readers. We can, however, find room for but\r\na few passages:—\r\n\r\n  “This _Palace_, with wild prospects girded round,\r\n  Stands in the middle of a falling ground,\r\n  At a black _mountain’s_ foot, whose craggy brow,\r\n  Secures from _eastern tempests_ all below,\r\n  Under whose shelter _trees_ and _flowers_ grow,\r\n  With early blossom, maugre native snow;\r\n  Which elsewhere round a _tyranny_ maintains,\r\n  And binds crampt _nature_ long in _crystal chains_.\r\n  The _fabrick’s_ noble front faces the _west_,\r\n  Turning her fair broad shoulders to the _east_;\r\n  On the _south_ side the stately _gardens_ lye,\r\n  Where the scorn’d _Peak_ rivals proud _Italy_.\r\n  And on the _north_ several inferior _plots_\r\n  For servile use do scatter’d lye in spots.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Environ’d round with _Nature’s_ shames and ills,\r\n  Black heaths, wild rocks, bleak craggs and naked hills\r\n  And the whole prospect so informe and rude,\r\n  Who is it, but must presently conclude\r\n  That this is _Paradise_, which seated stands\r\n  In midst of _desarts_, and of barren _sands?_”\r\n\r\nThe engraving from Knyff’s drawing illustrates, to a remarkable\r\ndegree, this description by Cotton, but for our present purpose\r\nit is not necessary, perhaps, to enter further into it. The house\r\nformed a quadrangle, the west front being the principal. An enclosed\r\ncarriage-drive with large gates led up to the north front; the stables\r\nand stable-yard were at the north-west angle; and the part where now\r\nthe Italian garden stands, was a large square pool of water with a\r\nfountain in its midst. Since then the whole of the grounds have been\r\nremodelled, the immense fish-pools, the stables, &c., taken away, and\r\na new part added to the mansion. The grounds were as fine, according\r\nto the taste of the times, as any then existing, and the description\r\ngiven of them by Charles Cotton brings vividly to the mind the time\r\nwhen “Sunday posies,” of “roses and lilies and daffy-down-dillies” were\r\nin vogue, and when peonies were worn in the button-hole; while rosemary\r\nand bay were the choicest of scents.\r\n\r\nFountains and statues as described by Hobbes and by Cotton still adorn\r\nthe grounds, and it may be well to note that the busts on the pillars\r\nin the Italian garden, which we engrave, originally belonged to the\r\ninner court of the old mansion.\r\n\r\nIn 1687, William Cavendish, third Earl of Devonshire, who was\r\nafterwards created Duke of Devonshire, after making considerable\r\nalterations in the gardens and grounds, commenced rebuilding the\r\nhouse. The first part commenced was the south front, which appears\r\nto have been begun to be rebuilt on the 12th of April, 1687, under\r\nthe direction of William Talman, the architect. The east side next\r\nfollowed; the great hall and staircase being covered in, in April,\r\n1690. In 1692 Sir Christopher Wren came down and surveyed the works, at\r\nwhich time it appears that about £9,000 had been expended. In 1693 the\r\neast front and the north-east corner were commenced, Talman receiving\r\n£600 in advance for the work. In 1700 the east front appears to have\r\nbeen completed, and about the same time the principal, or west, front\r\nof the old mansion was taken down, and the rebuilding completed in\r\n1706. In 1703 the old south gallery was demolished and rebuilt, and\r\nin 1704 the north front was removed, and the building of the new one\r\nto take its place commenced. The whole edifice appears to have been\r\nfinished in 1706, but its noble owner, whose munificence and taste\r\nreared the magnificent pile, did not long live to enjoy its beauties,\r\nfor he died in the following year, 1707. Dr. White Kennett, Bishop of\r\nPeterborough, who preached the funeral sermon of this nobleman, wrote\r\nat the time some account of the Cavendish family, in the course of\r\nwhich he introduced some highly interesting particulars relating to\r\nthe mansion and grounds, remarking that “tho’ such a vast pile (of\r\nmaterials entirely new) required a prodigious expense, yet the building\r\nwas the least charge, if regard be had to his gardens, water-works,\r\npictures, and other of the finest pieces of Art and Nature that could\r\nbe obtained abroad or at home.”\r\n\r\nThe Duke seems to have determined to erect a true Palace of Art, and\r\nfor that purpose he employed the best artists of the time in its\r\ndecoration. Among the painters employed to decorate the ceilings\r\nand walls of the various rooms with the creations of their genius,\r\nwere Verrio, Laguerre, Sir James Thornhill, Ricard, Highmore\r\n(sergeant-painter to William III.), Price, and Huyd. The carvers in\r\nstone and wood, whose names appear in the accounts, were Caius Gabriel\r\nCibber, Samuel Watson, Henry Watson his son, Mons. Nadauld, J. T.\r\nGeeraerslius, Augustine Harris, Nost, William Davies, M. Auriol, Joel\r\nLobb, and Lanscroon. The principal iron-worker appears to have been\r\nMons. Tijou, a French smith, whose daughter was wife of Laguerre the\r\npainter; and the lead-worker, who did the regular plumber’s work, as\r\nwell as the lead-piping of the willow-tree, and other water-works under\r\nthe guidance of Mons. Grillet, was a Mr. Cock, of London, whose bill\r\ncame to about £1,000.\r\n\r\nIn 1820 the late Duke—William Spencer Cavendish, sixth Duke of\r\nDevonshire—who had succeeded to the title in 1811, commenced some\r\ngreat improvements at Chatsworth by erecting, from the designs of\r\nSir Jeffrey Wyatt, the north wing, containing, with all the domestic\r\noffices, a number of other apartments, as well as the dining-room,\r\nsculpture-gallery, orangery, banqueting-room, and pavilion; and by\r\naltering and re-arranging several other rooms. The grounds and gardens,\r\nalso, were by this gifted nobleman, very materially remodelled and\r\nimproved under the direction of his head-gardener, the late Sir Joseph\r\nPaxton, to whose labours, including the erection of the gigantic\r\nconservatory, the forming of the artificial rocks, &c., we shall have\r\nto refer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Chatsworth from the River Derwent._]\r\n\r\nHaving now traced so far as is necessary for our present purpose the\r\nhistory of Chatsworth, we proceed to speak of the noble and historical\r\nfamily of Cavendish, its princely owners. This, however, we shall do\r\nbut briefly; having already, in our account of Hardwick Hall, gone into\r\nthe family history at some length.\r\n\r\nThe family of Cavendish, to whose noble head Chatsworth belongs, traces\r\nback to the Conquest, when Robert de Gernon, who came over with the\r\nConqueror, was rewarded by him for his services with large grants of\r\nlands in Hertfordshire, Gloucestershire, &c. His descendants held\r\nconsiderable land in Derbyshire; and Sir William Gernon, _temp._ Henry\r\nIII., had two sons, Sir Ralph de Gernon, lord of Bakewell, and Geoffrey\r\nde Gernon, of Moor Hall, near Bakewell. From the second of these,\r\nGeoffrey de Gernon, the Cavendishes are descended; his son, Roger de\r\nGernon (who died in 1334), having married the heiress of the lord of\r\nthe manor of Cavendish, in Suffolk; and by her had issue four sons, who\r\nall assumed the name of Cavendish from that manor. These sons were Sir\r\nJohn Cavendish, Chief Justice of the King’s Bench; Roger Cavendish,\r\nfrom whom descended the celebrated navigator, Sir Thomas Cavendish;\r\nStephen Cavendish, Lord Mayor of London; and Richard Cavendish. Sir\r\nJohn married Alice Odyngseles, who brought to her husband the manor of\r\nCavendish Overhall; and their eldest son, Sir Andrew Cavendish, left\r\nissue, one son, William, from whom the estates passed to his cousin.\r\nSir Andrew was succeeded by his brother, Sir John Cavendish, who, for\r\nhis gallant conduct in killing the rebel, Wat Tyler, was knighted\r\nby the king; he married Joan, daughter to Sir William Clopton, and\r\nwas succeeded by his eldest son, William, a citizen and mercer of\r\nLondon, who married Joan Staventon, by whom he had issue two sons, the\r\neldest of whom, Thomas, succeeded him; and whose son and heir, Sir\r\nThomas Cavendish, Clerk of the Pipe, &c., married twice, and left by\r\nhis first wife three sons, George Cavendish, who wrote the “Life of\r\nCardinal Wolsey,” Sir William Cavendish, and Sir Thomas Cavendish. The\r\nsecond of these sons, Sir William Cavendish, became the founder of the\r\npresent ducal house of Devonshire and of several other noble families.\r\nHe married, first, a daughter of Edward Bostock, of Whatcross, in\r\nCheshire; second, a daughter of Sir Thomas Conyngsby, and widow of\r\nWilliam Paris; and third, Elizabeth, daughter of John Hardwick, of\r\nHardwick, Derbyshire, and widow of Robert Barley, of Barley, in the\r\nsame county. Of this lady, who became much celebrated as the Countess\r\nof Shrewsbury—“Bess of Hardwick,” as she was called—an account will\r\nbe found in the present volume under the head of Hardwick Hall. By\r\nthese three wives Sir William had a numerous family. By his first he\r\nhad one son and two daughters who died young, and two daughters who\r\nmarried; by his second he had three daughters, who died young; and by\r\nhis third (“Bess of Hardwick”), he had also several children. These\r\nwere Henry Cavendish of Tutbury; Sir William Cavendish, created Earl of\r\nDevonshire, and who was the direct ancestor of the Dukes of Devonshire;\r\nSir Charles Cavendish, whose son was created Baron Cavendish of\r\nBolsover, Baron Ogle, Viscount Mansfield, and Earl, Marquis, and Duke\r\nof Newcastle; Frances, married to Sir Henry Pierrepoint, ancestor of\r\nthe Duke of Kingston; Elizabeth, married to Charles Stuart, Duke of\r\nLennox (brother of Lord Darnley, the husband of Mary, Queen of Scots,\r\nand father of King James I.), the issue of which marriage was the\r\nill-fated Arabella Stuart, who was born at Chatsworth; and Mary, who\r\nbecame the wife of Gilbert, Earl of Shrewsbury. Sir William Cavendish\r\nwas succeeded by his son, Sir William Cavendish, who was created Baron\r\nCavendish of Hardwick, and Earl of Devonshire, by King James I., “at\r\nwhich time of his creation his Majesty stood under a cloth of state\r\nin the hall at Greenwich, accompanied with the princes, his children,\r\nthe Duke of Holstein, the Duke of Lennox, and the greatest part of the\r\nnobility, both of England and Scotland.” The earl married, first, Anne,\r\ndaughter of Henry Kighley, of Kighley; and, second, Elizabeth, daughter\r\nof Sir Edward Boughton, and widow of Sir Richard Wortley.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Entrance Gates._]\r\n\r\nHe was succeeded by his second son by his first wife, Sir William\r\nCavendish, as second Earl of Devonshire. This nobleman—who had been\r\nunder the tuition of the famous philosopher, Thomas Hobbes—married\r\nChristiana, only daughter of Edward, Lord Bruce of Kinloss, a kinswoman\r\nof the king, “who gave her with his own hand, and made her fortune ten\r\nthousand pounds.” By her he had issue three sons and one daughter, and\r\nwas succeeded by his eldest son, William, as third Earl of Devonshire,\r\nwho was only ten years of age at his father’s death. This nobleman\r\nmarried Elizabeth Cecil, daughter of the Earl of Salisbury, by whom\r\nhe had two sons, William (who succeeded him) and Charles, and one\r\ndaughter. William, fourth Earl of Devonshire, before succeeding to\r\nthe title, was one of the train-bearers to the king on his coronation,\r\nand sat in the Long Parliament as member for Derbyshire. His lordship\r\nwas one of the principals in bringing about “the Glorious Revolution”\r\nof 1688, and placing William III. on the throne; the place of meeting\r\nfor plotting for the great and good change being on Whittington Moor,\r\nnot many miles from Chatsworth, at a small cottage-inn belonging to\r\nthe Duke of Devonshire, known as the “Cock and Pynot” (_pynot_ being\r\nthe provincial name of the magpie), still existing, but recently\r\npartly rebuilt. The “plotting parlour,” as the room in this cottage is\r\ncalled, in which the Earl of Devonshire met Earl Danby, John d’Arcy,\r\nand others, to plan the revolution, is held in veneration, and the very\r\nchair in which the earl sat during the deliberations is preserved by\r\nhis Grace at Hardwick Hall, where it has been taken, and is, indeed, a\r\nmost interesting historical relic. The earl, who, as we have already\r\nstated, was the rebuilder of Chatsworth, married Mary, daughter of\r\nthe Duke of Ormonde, by whom he had issue three sons, William (his\r\nsuccessor), Henry, and James; and one daughter, Elizabeth. His lordship\r\nwas, in 1694, advanced by William III. to the dignity of Marquis of\r\nHartington and Duke of Devonshire. He died in 1707, and was succeeded,\r\nas second duke and fifth earl, by his son, William Cavendish,\r\ncaptain of the yeomen of the guard to the king, who succeeded to\r\nall his father’s appointments, including being Lord Steward of the\r\nHousehold, Privy Councillor, Lord Warden and Chief Justice in Eyre,\r\nLord Lieutenant, K.G., &c.; he was also made one of the Regents of the\r\nkingdom. His grace married Rachel, daughter of William, Lord Russel,\r\nand on his death was succeeded by his son William as third Duke of\r\nDevonshire.\r\n\r\nThe third Duke, who became Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Lord Keeper of\r\nthe Privy Seal, Lord Steward of the Household, Lord Justice for the\r\nadministration of government during the king’s absence, Lord Lieutenant\r\nof Derbyshire, &c., married Catherine, heiress of John Hoskins, by whom\r\nhe had a numerous family. He was succeeded by his son—\r\n\r\nWilliam, as fourth Duke of Devonshire, who had, during his father’s\r\nlifetime, been called to the Upper House by the title, hitherto of\r\ncourtesy, of Marquis of Hartington. His grace was made Master of the\r\nHorse, a Privy Councillor, one of the Lords of the Regency, Governor\r\nof the County of Cork, Lord High Treasurer of Ireland, Lord-Lieutenant\r\nof Ireland, First Commissioner of the Treasury, and Chamberlain of the\r\nHousehold, &c. He married Charlotte, daughter, and ultimately heiress,\r\nof Richard Boyle, Earl of Burlington and Cork, by which alliance—the\r\nlady being Baroness Clifford in her own right—the barony of Clifford\r\ncame into the Cavendish family. The issue of this marriage was three\r\nsons and one daughter—viz., William, who succeeded to the title and\r\nestates; Lord Richard, who died unmarried; Lord George Augustus Henry,\r\nwho was created Earl of Burlington, from whom the present noble Duke\r\nof Devonshire is descended; and Lady Dorothy, married to the Duke of\r\nPortland.\r\n\r\nWilliam, fifth Duke of Devonshire, married—first, the Lady Georgiana,\r\ndaughter of Earl Spencer, one of the most accomplished and elegant\r\nwomen of the time, and who is best and most emphatically known as “the\r\nbeautiful Duchess,” by whom he had issue one son, William Spencer\r\nCavendish (who succeeded him), and two daughters, the Lady Georgiana,\r\nmarried to the Earl of Carlisle; and the Lady Harriet Elizabeth,\r\nmarried to Earl Granville. His grace married secondly the Lady\r\nElizabeth Foster, daughter of the Earl of Bristol, and widow of John\r\nThomas Foster, Esq. On his death, in 1811, the title and estates passed\r\nto his only son—\r\n\r\nWilliam Spencer Cavendish, sixth Duke and ninth Earl of Devonshire,\r\none of the most kindly, generous, and liberal-minded men, and one of\r\nthe most zealous patrons of art and literature. He was born in Paris\r\nin 1790, and, besides holding the office of Lord High Chamberlain,\r\n&c., went on a special embassy to Russia from the British court. This\r\nembassy his grace conducted on a scale of princely magnificence at\r\nhis own charge, and concluded it to the entire satisfaction of both\r\nnations. By him the modern improvements of Chatsworth were, with\r\nmaster-mind and lavish hand, planned and carried out. His grace, who\r\nnever married, died in January, 1858, and was succeeded in his titles\r\nand estates—with the exception of the barony of Clifford, which\r\nfell into abeyance between his sisters—by his second cousin, the\r\npresent noble head of the house, who was grandson of the first Earl of\r\nBurlington. The sixth Duke—the “Good Duke,” for by that title he is\r\nknown best, and it is as amply merited by the present noble peer—was,\r\nby express wish, buried in the churchyard at Edensor, just outside the\r\npark at Chatsworth, where a plain and perfectly simple coped tomb, with\r\nfoliated cross, covers his remains.\r\n\r\nThe present noble owner of princely Chatsworth, William Cavendish,\r\nseventh Duke of Devonshire, Marquis of Hartington, Earl of Devonshire,\r\nEarl of Burlington, Baron Cavendish of Hardwick, Baron Cavendish of\r\nKeighley, &c., Knight of the Garter, LL.D., F.R.S., Lord Lieutenant and\r\nCustos Rotulorum of the County of Derby, Chancellor of the University\r\nof Cambridge, High Steward of the Borough of Derby, &c., was born 27th\r\nApril, 1808. His grace is the eldest son of William Cavendish, eldest\r\nson (by his wife the Lady Elizabeth Compton, daughter and heiress\r\nof Charles, seventh Earl of Northampton), of George Augustus Henry\r\nCavendish (third son of the fourth Duke of Devonshire, by his wife the\r\nLady Charlotte Boyle, as already stated), first Earl of Burlington,\r\nand Baron Cavendish, of Keighley, which titles were created in his\r\nfavour in 1831: he died in 1834. William Cavendish, just referred to,\r\nwas born in 1783, and in 1807 married the Hon. Louisa O’Callaghan,\r\neldest daughter of Cornelius, first Baron Lismore, by whom he had issue\r\nthree sons and one daughter, viz., the present Duke of Devonshire;\r\nLord George Henry Cavendish, the present highly-respected M.P. for\r\nNorth Derbyshire, of Ashford Hall, in that county, married to Lady\r\nLouisa, youngest daughter of the second Earl of Harewood; Lady Fanny\r\nCavendish, married to Frederick John Howard, Esq.; and Lord Richard\r\nCavendish, all of whom are still living. Mr. Cavendish died in 1812,\r\nbefore his eldest child, the present Duke, was four years of age, his\r\nwife surviving him until 1864. His grace was educated at Eton, and\r\nat Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated as M.A., and was\r\nSecond Wrangler, Senior Smith’s Prizeman, and in the first class of\r\nthe Classical Tripos, 1829. In the same year he became M.P. for the\r\nUniversity of Cambridge, which seat he held until 1831, when he was\r\nreturned for Malton, and in the same year, as Lord Cavendish, for\r\nDerbyshire, and at the general election in the following year, for\r\nNorth Derbyshire, which constituency he represented until 1834, when\r\nhe succeeded his grandfather as second Earl of Burlington. In 1856 he\r\nwas, as Earl of Burlington, made Lord-Lieutenant of Lancashire, a post\r\nhe held until 1858, when, on succeeding to the Dukedom of Devonshire,\r\nhe was appointed Lord-Lieutenant of Derbyshire. From 1836 to 1858 he\r\nwas Chancellor of the University of London, and, besides many other\r\nimportant appointments, is at the present time President of Owen’s\r\nCollege, Manchester.\r\n\r\nHis grace, at that time Mr. Cavendish, married, 1829, his cousin, the\r\nLady Blanche Georgiana Howard, fourth daughter of the sixth Earl of\r\nCarlisle, by his wife the Lady Georgiana Dorothy Cavendish, daughter\r\nof the fifth Duke of Devonshire. By this beautiful and accomplished,\r\nas well as truly estimable lady, who died in 1840, his grace had issue\r\nfour sons and one daughter, who, with the exception of the eldest, are\r\nstill living. These are—\r\n\r\n1st. Spencer Compton Cavendish, Marquis of Hartington, M.P., P.C.,\r\nLL.D., was born in 1833, and is unmarried. The Marquis was educated at\r\nTrinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated as B.A. in 1852, M.A. in\r\n1854, and LL.D. in 1862. He holds at the present time the responsible\r\npost of Her Majesty’s Chief Secretary of State for Ireland, and has\r\nsuccessively held office as a Lord of the Admiralty, Under-Secretary of\r\nState for War, Secretary of State for War, and Postmaster-General, and\r\nwas attached to Lord Granville’s special mission to Russia.\r\n\r\n2nd. The Lady Louisa Caroline Cavendish, born in 1835, and married\r\nin 1865 to Admiral the Hon. Francis Egerton, R.N., M.P. for East\r\nDerbyshire, son of the first Earl of Ellesmere, by whom she has issue\r\ntwo sons and one daughter.\r\n\r\n3rd. Lord Frederick Charles Cavendish, M.P. for the north division of\r\nthe West Riding of Yorkshire, born in 1836, and married in 1864 to the\r\nHon. Lucy Caroline, daughter of Baron Lyttelton.\r\n\r\n4th. Lord Edward Cavendish, late M.P. for East Sussex, born in 1838,\r\nand married in 1865 to Emma Elizabeth Lascelles, a maid of honour to\r\nthe Queen, and granddaughter to the Earl of Harewood, by whom he has\r\nissue two sons.\r\n\r\nHis grace is patron of thirty-nine livings, and in Derbyshire alone\r\nis lord of forty-six manors. His other seats are:—Hardwick Hall,\r\nDerbyshire, about fifteen miles from Chatsworth; Holkar Hall, in\r\nCartmel; Bolton Abbey, Yorkshire; Lismore Castle, Ireland; Compton\r\nPlace, Eastbourne, Sussex; and Devonshire House, London.\r\n\r\nThe arms of the Duke of Devonshire are—_sable_, three harts’ heads,\r\ncaboshed, _argent_, attired, _or_. Crest: a serpent noued, _proper_.\r\nSupporters: two bucks, _proper_, each wreathed round the neck with a\r\nchaplet of roses, alternately _argent_ and _azure_.\r\n\r\nThere are four principal entrances to Chatsworth Park, two of\r\nwhich—those at Edensor and Edensor Mill—are public, and the other two\r\n(at Baslow and at Beeley) are private. The Baslow Lodge, shown on our\r\nengraving, is stately and noble in the extreme, and forms a fitting\r\nentrance to so magnificent a domain. The Beeley Lodge is simple and\r\nunassuming; and that at Edensor, with its rustic cottages, remarkably\r\npretty. The most picturesque, however, in regard to its situation,\r\nis the Edensor Mill Lodge, which we also engrave. Near it runs the\r\nriver Derwent, spanned by the single arch of Beeley Bridge, and it is\r\ncharmingly embosomed in trees and shrubs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Grand Entrance-Lodge at Baslow._]\r\n\r\nBy whichever of the lodges the visitor enters this “wide domain,”—if\r\nfrom the south, it will be at Edensor Mill or Beeley, and from the\r\nnorth and other parts at Edensor or Baslow,—he will have a rich treat,\r\nindeed, of scenery to interest him on his progress to the mansion.\r\nThe park is divided in two by the river Derwent, which flows through\r\nit, the mansion and the Baslow and Beeley Lodges being on one side,\r\nand Edensor, Edensor Lodge, and Edensor Mill Lodge on the other. From\r\neither of these latter routes, which are on the higher side of the\r\npark, the visitor obtains the finest views of the house and grounds,\r\nand will, in his approach, cross the Derwent by the elegant bridge\r\nshown in the engraving on page 343.\r\n\r\nArrived at the house, he will—after proper application at the\r\nLodge, and the necessary permission obtained—be ushered through the\r\nexquisitely beautiful gates shown on the engraving on the next page,\r\nand be conducted through the court-yard—where stands a magnificent\r\nweeping ash-tree, of enormous size (we well remember seeing it removed,\r\nbodily, from Mile-Ash, near Derby, to its present proud position, as\r\nlong ago as 1830)—to the state entrance. Admitted to the princely\r\nmansion, the first room the visitor enters is—\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Edensor Mill Lodge and Beeley Bridge._]\r\n\r\nThe SUB-HALL, a spacious apartment, the ceiling of which is enriched by\r\na copy of Guido’s “Aurora,” painted by Miss Curzon. The sculpture in\r\nthis sub-hall includes a statue of Domitian; busts of Homer, Jupiter,\r\nAriadne, Socrates, Caracalla, and others. From this hall the visitor\r\nnext enters the North Corridor, and, turning to his left, passes along\r\nits exquisitely inlaid marble floor, to the Great Hall, which occupies\r\nthe whole length of the eastern side of the quadrangle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe GREAT HALL, or GRAND HALL, is a noble room, 60 feet in length by\r\n27 feet in width, and of the full height of the two principal stories\r\nof the mansion. The floor is formed of polished marble, laid in a\r\nremarkably striking geometric design, in mosaic, of black and white and\r\nveined marbles. It was originally the work of Henry Watson, being laid\r\ndown by him in 1779; but was taken up and relaid, with considerable\r\nalterations, by the late Duke. In the centre of the hall stands an\r\nimmense marble table, of Derbyshire marble, and the chimney-piece,\r\nwhich is very massive, is also of marble. At the south end of the\r\nhall is the grand staircase, leading to the state apartments, and at\r\nthe north end, beyond the corridor, are the north stairs. The hall is\r\nfour windows in length, and galleries of communication between the\r\nnorth and south run, midway in height, along the sides. The ceiling\r\nand walls of the upper story are painted in the most masterly manner\r\nin historical subjects, by Laguerre and Verrio. The series of subjects\r\nare events in the life of Julius Cæsar:—They are, his passing the\r\nRubicon; his passing over to his army at Brundusium; sacrificing before\r\ngoing to the Senate, after the closing of the temple of Janus; and his\r\ndeath in the Senate House at the foot of Pompey’s pillar; and on the\r\nceiling is his apotheosis or deification. Between the windows, and in\r\nthe window-cases, are also painted trophies of arms, and wreaths of\r\nflowers, &c. In the hall are two remarkably fine bronze busts placed\r\nupon pedestals, and other interesting objects, among which is a fine\r\ncanoe, the gift of the Sultan to the late Duke. Over the fire-place is\r\na marble tablet bearing the following inscription:—\r\n\r\n  “ÆDES HAS PATERNAS DILECTISSIMAS.\r\n  ANNO LIBERTATIS ANGLICÆ MDCLXXXVIII INSTITUTAS.\r\n  GUL : S : DEVONIÆ DUX, ANNO MDCCCXI HÆRES ACCEPIT,\r\n  ANNO MŒRORIS SUI MDCCCXL PERPECIT;”\r\n\r\nwhich may be thus translated:—\r\n\r\n  “These well-loved ancestral halls,\r\n  Begun in the year of English Freedom, 1688,\r\n  William Spencer, Duke of Devonshire, inherited in 1811,\r\n  And completed in the year of sorrow, 1840.”\r\n\r\nThe “year of sorrow,” so touchingly alluded to, being that of the death\r\nof the much-loved and highly-gifted Countess of Burlington, the wife of\r\nthe present noble owner of Chatsworth. On the exterior of this grand\r\nhall, on the east side of the quadrangle, are some trophies of arms,\r\n&c., magnificently and boldly carved in _alto-relievo_ in stone, by\r\nWatson.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Bridge over the River Derwent, in the Park._]\r\n\r\nIn this hall, of which our engraving gives but a sorry representation,\r\nthe visitor is usually asked to remain for a short time, and to\r\ninscribe his name in the visitors’ book on the central table. From the\r\ncentre of the south end of this noble room, the grand staircase leads\r\nup to the various suites of apartments on the library and state-room\r\nstories, and on either side of this staircase an open archway gives\r\naccess to the “Grotto-Room,” the south corridor, and the apartments on\r\nthe ground floor. From the corridor at the north end, the north stairs\r\ngive access in like manner to the various apartments and to the north\r\nwing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Great Hall and Staircase._]\r\n\r\nThe house is three stories in height, and these are known as the\r\nbasement, the library, and the state-room stories. Through the\r\nextreme kindness and liberality of the noble Duke a part of each of\r\nthese stories is, under proper regulations, permitted to be shown to\r\nvisitors. It is not our intention to describe these various apartments\r\nin the order in which they are shown to visitors—for this would for\r\nmany reasons be an inconvenient and unwise arrangement—but will speak\r\nof them according to the stories on which they occur. And first we take\r\nthe upper, or state-room story, which, like the others, runs round\r\nthe four sides of the quadrangle. The State-rooms and Sketch-Gallery\r\noccupy the south side; the grand staircase is at the south-east angle;\r\nthe continuation of the gallery of old masters, the west stairs, and a\r\nnumber of bed-rooms, including the Sabine-room, occupy the west side;\r\nthe north is taken up with bed-rooms, with the north staircase at the\r\nnorth-east angle; while on the east are “Mary Queen of Scots’ Rooms,”\r\nso called because occupying the same position as those used by her\r\nin the old mansion which was removed and rebuilt, and other suites\r\nof splendid sleeping apartments which of course are not shown to the\r\nvisitor.\r\n\r\nThe SKETCH-GALLERY, which, as we have said, occupies the south and a\r\npart of the west side, contains perhaps the most choice and extensive\r\ncollection of original drawings by the old masters in any private\r\ncollection, embracing the Italian, French, Flemish, Venetian, Spanish,\r\nand other schools; and containing matchless examples of Raffaelle,\r\nMichael Angelo, Albert Dürer, Titian, Rembrandt, Rubens, Leonardo da\r\nVinci, Poussin, Claude, Salvator Rosa, Correggio, Luca Signorelli,\r\nAndrea del Sarto, Lo Spagna, Giulio Romano, Caravaggio, Zucchero,\r\nAndrea Mantegna, Parmigiano, Giorgione, Giulio Campagnola, Paul\r\nVeronese, the Carracci, Guido Reni, Domenichino, Guercino, Holbein,\r\nLucas Cranach, Lucas Van Leyden, Vandyke, Van der Velde, Jan Miel, and\r\nindeed of almost every well-known name. The collection was formed by\r\nthe second Duke of Devonshire at considerable cost; the nucleus being\r\npurchased at Rotterdam. Among those by Michael Angelo are a study for\r\nthe ceiling of the Sistine Chapel; some spirited studies of figures\r\nfor the same ceiling; and a Virgin and Child. By Leonardo da Vinci a\r\nfine head of the Virgin. By Raffaelle are the sketch for the picture\r\nby Pinturicchio at Sienna, of “Æneas Silvius kissing the foot of Pope\r\nEugenius IV. at the Council of Basle;” the figure of St. Paul for the\r\ncartoon of “The Sacrifice at Lystra;” “St. Catherine,” the original\r\nsketch for the picture now in the National Gallery; “the Virgin and\r\nChild;” “Joseph discovering himself to his Brethren;” and others. By\r\nHolbein, some of the finest known examples, including “the Fall of\r\nPhaeton,” “the Last Judgment,” “Hagar and Ishmael,” “Diana and Actæon,”\r\nand others. By Albert Dürer several fine examples. Altogether the\r\ncollection is the most remarkable in any mansion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Vista of the State Apartments._]\r\n\r\nThe State-apartments, which are entered from this Gallery, consist of a\r\nsplendid suite of rooms, occupying the entire length of the building.\r\nThe entrance is through a small apartment around the walls of which\r\nis arranged a fine collection of examples of Ceramic Art, including\r\nmany good specimens of the more famous English and foreign makes.\r\nThese were, in great measure, removed here from the Duke’s villa at\r\nChiswick. Adjoining this, at the south-west angles, is—\r\n\r\nThe STATE DRESSING-ROOM, the coved ceiling of which is beautifully\r\npainted, the subject being, in the centre, the flight of Mercury on\r\nhis mission to Paris, and, on the coving, groups representing the Arts\r\nand Sciences. The wood-carving in this room, as in the whole of this\r\nsuite of apartments, is of the most wonderful and most exquisitely\r\nbeautiful character, and is unmatched in any other existing mansion.\r\nOn the west side are four pendants and a group of the most delicate\r\nworkmanship, and over the principal doorway is represented a group of\r\ncarvers’ tools, &c.—a globe, compass, brace and bit, square, augurs,\r\nchisels, gouges, _cum multis aliis_, and a small bust. This apartment\r\ncontains some fine Japan, inlaid, and other cabinets, and curious old\r\nearthenware; and on the walls, besides a clever picture in mosaic, is a\r\nframe containing what is universally admitted to be the finest and most\r\nwonderful specimen of wood-carving ever executed;—this we engrave.\r\nIt is usually called “Grinling Gibbons’ masterpiece,” and whether by\r\nGibbons or not (and there is no direct authority either one way or\r\nother), it is, _indeed_, a masterpiece of art. Concerning the question\r\nwhether the carving is by Gibbons or not, we shall have a few words to\r\nsay when writing of the chapel. The “masterpiece” is a group consisting\r\nof a cravat of point-lace, as clear and delicate in the open-work as\r\nthe finest lace itself, a woodcock, some foliage, and a medal with a\r\nbust in relief. Of this group Horace Walpole thus wrote:—“When Gibbons\r\nhad finished his work at that palace (Chatsworth) he presented the\r\nDuke with a point cravat, a woodcock, and a medal with his own head,\r\nall preserved in a glass-case in the gallery;” but he had no authority\r\nfor any such statement, nor is there any record of Gibbons having ever\r\nbeen at Chatsworth. From the door of this room the vista, when looking\r\nthrough the state-apartments, is remarkably striking and effective; the\r\nflooring throughout the suite being of oak parqueterie which reflects\r\nthe light in a pleasing manner. This we engrave.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Grinling Gibbons’ Masterpiece._]\r\n\r\nThe OLD STATE-BED-ROOM, the first apartment seen through the doorway in\r\nour engraving, is a fine and very interesting apartment. The ceiling,\r\nwhich is coved, is splendidly painted, the principal subject being\r\n“Aurora chasing away the Night;” and the walls are hung with embossed\r\nleather of rich arabesque pattern, heavily gilded; the frieze, also\r\nof embossed leather, is richly foliated, with medallions bearing\r\nrespectively the bust of the late Duke of Devonshire, his crest and\r\ncoronet, and his monogram, alternating round the room. Over the\r\ndoorways are splendid examples of wood-carving of groups of musical\r\ninstruments; on one group is suspended a medallion head of Charles II.,\r\nand the words “CAROLVS II. DEI GRATIA,” and on the other a watch. Over\r\nand around the chimney-piece are cherubs’ heads, birds, foliage, &c.,\r\nof the same fine class of wood-carving. In this room (besides cabinets,\r\nvases, and beakers, and a charming model of the tomb of Madame Langlan,\r\nat Hildebank, near Berne, in which the spirits of the mother and child\r\nare seen bursting through their broken tomb) is a noble and ancient\r\nembroidered canopy and state-chair, the work of Christiana, Countess of\r\nDevonshire, the wife of the second Earl of Devonshire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Old State Bed-room._]\r\n\r\nThe canopy is of crimson velvet, exquisitely covered with needlework\r\nin gold and colours, in groups of figures, trees, animals, and\r\ninsects;—here, a goat, a stag, a fox, a rabbit, a pig, dogs both\r\nleashed and single, a horse, an eagle, and a swan; there, butterflies,\r\nflies, and innumerable other devices around; while inside the top\r\na group of three figures within a border is in the centre, and the\r\nrest dotted with animals, flowers, &c., with a border of figures and\r\nfoliage. The back of the canopy bears, above the chair, the arms of\r\nCavendish (_sable_, three bucks’ heads caboshed, _argent_, attired\r\n_or_) impaling those of Bruce of Kinloss (_or_, a saltire and a\r\nchief, _gules_, on a canton, _argent_, a lion rampant, _azure_), with\r\nmantling, helmet, crest, &c. Supporters, dexter, a stag, proper,\r\ngorged with a wreath of roses, _argent_ and _azure_, attired _or_,\r\nfor Cavendish; sinister, a wild man, proper, wreathed round the\r\nhead and loins with laurel, _vert_, for Bruce. Motto, CAVENDO TVTVS\r\nFVIMVS; the first part, “Cavendo Tvtvs,” being the Cavendish motto,\r\nand the latter part, “Fvimvs,” that of Bruce; the rest of the velvet\r\nis covered with flowers, animals, &c., and surrounded by a border of\r\ngroups and flowers. The chair is of the same character, Christiana,\r\nCountess of Devonshire, to whose fair hands is owing this charming\r\npiece of embroidery, and to whose good taste the arrangement of these\r\nblended armorial insignia is due, was the daughter of Edward, Lord\r\nBruce of Kinloss, and sister of the first Earl of Elgin, from whom the\r\npresent ninth Earl is lineally descended. The armorial bearings upon\r\nthis canopy are therefore peculiarly interesting as showing, not only\r\nthe impaled arms themselves, but the blended supporters and motto, of\r\nCavendish and Bruce. In this room are also preserved the coronation\r\nchairs and foot-stools of George III., and Queen Charlotte, and of\r\nWilliam IV. and Queen Adelaide; and a wardrobe which is said, whether\r\ncorrectly or not, to have belonged to Louis XVI.\r\n\r\nThe STATE MUSIC-ROOM, like the others, contains some exquisite\r\nwood-carving. Over one doorway are flowers, fruit, wreaths, wings, &c.,\r\nand a ribbon with the family motto “CAVENDO TVTVS;” over the other,\r\nflowers, fruit, and cornucopia; and over the chimney-piece are heads,\r\nfestoons, flowers, fruit, corn, foliage, &c., all true to nature.\r\nOver the central door is a group of musical instruments, and in the\r\ncentre of the frieze is a garter and monogram. The walls are hung with\r\nembossed leather, richly gilt and heightened with blue, and the frieze\r\nhas the medallion heads, crest, and monogram of the late Duke, as in\r\nthe apartment just described. The ceiling is splendidly painted with\r\nmythological subjects, and several interesting pictures, busts, and\r\nother objects, are arranged in the room. One of the features of this\r\napartment remains to be noticed. It is a curious piece of deceptive\r\npainting on one of the double doors leading to the gallery—a fiddle\r\npainted so cleverly on the door itself as to have, in the subdued light\r\nof the half-closed door, all the appearance of the instrument itself\r\nhanging upon a peg. The tradition of Chatsworth is, that this matchless\r\npiece of painting was done by Verrio to deceive Gibbons, who, in his\r\ncarvings, had deceived others by his close imitation of nature.\r\n\r\nThe STATE DRAWING-ROOM has its walls hung with tapestry from\r\nRaffaelle’s cartoons, and its carved ceiling is splendidly painted\r\nwith mythological and allegorical subjects, in the same manner as the\r\nrest of this suite of rooms. The carving over one of the doors is a\r\nmilitary trophy, consisting of swords, drum, battle-axes, shield,\r\nhelmet, with dragon crest, foliage, &c.; and over the other, military\r\nmusic and foliage. Above the chimney-piece, around an oval in which is\r\na portrait of the first Duke, are Cupids, trophies, shells, foliage,\r\nmasks, helmets, arms, &c., and an owl; beneath these are two carved\r\nbanners with the Cavendish arms, tied together with a snake (the family\r\ncrest). Among the furniture and adornments of this room are some fine\r\nexamples of china and earthenware, and a remarkably large malachite\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The State Drawing-room._]\r\n\r\nThe STATE DINING-ROOM, which forms the south-east angle of the\r\nbuilding, is a splendid apartment, the ceiling of which, by Verrio, is\r\nof the most masterly conception, and represents, among an assemblage of\r\ngods and goddesses, the Fates cutting the thread of life, &c., and on\r\none side of the coving is a monogram of the letter D.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The State Dining-room._]\r\n\r\nThe carvings in this noble apartment are of matchless character, and\r\nhang in a profusion that is almost bewildering. In the panels of the\r\nwainscoted walls are festoons of flowers, &c.; over one doorway is a\r\ngroup of leaves and corn, and over the other two are splendid groups\r\nof crabs, lobsters, fish, and shells, all “as true to nature as nature\r\nitself.” Over the fire-place, across the top, and hanging down the\r\nsides of an octagonal tablet, is the richest of all the rich carvings\r\nof this suite of rooms. It consists of dead game—heron, pheasants,\r\n&c., at the top; over and around these a net is loosely thrown, which,\r\nhanging down the sides, forms a groundwork of festoons, on which hang\r\npheasants, woodcocks, grouse, partridges, snipes, and other birds, so\r\ntrue to life that it is only by careful examination that the spectator\r\ncan discover that they, with the net and all the mouldings, are carved\r\nout of solid wood. In this room are several busts in marble by\r\nChantrey, Nollekens, and others. Among these are the Emperor Nicholas\r\nof Russia, and his Empress; Fox; Canning; Francis, Duke of Bedford;\r\nLord G. H. Cavendish, &c. There are also cabinets of rare old china. On\r\nthe central table will be noticed, among rare and valuable articles,\r\nthe rosary of King Henry VIII.; a fine set of carved ivory chessmen;\r\nivory-carvings, rare glass and china; and silver filigree and other\r\nornaments. And there is also the malachite clock presented to the late\r\nDuke by the Emperor Nicholas of Russia, and an exquisitely sculptured\r\nmarble model of the Victoria Regia.\r\n\r\nFrom this room a doorway opens on to the GRAND STAIRCASE—the casings\r\nof the doorways, of exquisitely-carved marble, being worthy of especial\r\nnote—in the south-east angle. Opposite this doorway another door opens\r\ninto a suite of apartments, of course not shown to visitors, but to\r\nwhich some brief allusion may here be made. Here are the rooms usually\r\nknown as MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS’ ROOMS, but which really have no possible\r\nconnection with that ill-fated lady. They are so called because they\r\noccupy the same position in the present building as those used by her\r\ndid in the old one; they overlook the inner court, or quadrangle, on\r\nits east side. The other suites of bed-rooms adjoining are known as the\r\n“Leicester” and “Wellington” rooms, and they are fitted, as may well be\r\nsupposed, in a style of princely magnificence. In one of these rooms\r\nis the bed and bed-room suite used by Her Majesty Queen Victoria when\r\na guest at Chatsworth. This suite is of satin-wood, hung in green and\r\nwhite satin.\r\n\r\nOn this same floor is the SABINE-ROOM, so called from the subject\r\nof the “Rape of the Sabines,” by which it is adorned. This singular\r\napartment, when the doors are closed, is one large painting, the whole\r\nsurface, from floor to ceiling, doors included, being painted with\r\nfigures, groups, and architecture, &c. The ceiling, too, is splendidly\r\npainted with an allegorical subject. At the angles of the coving is the\r\nmonogram of the Duke of Devonshire, within a garter, and surmounted by\r\nthe Ducal coronet. The furniture of this and the adjoining room is of\r\nthe finest, most massive, and sumptuous description.\r\n\r\nThe MIDDLE, or LIBRARY STORY, besides occupying the four sides of the\r\nquadrangle or inner court (in the same manner as the upper story),\r\nextends the whole length of the north wing; it is, therefore, the\r\nmost extensive and important part of the mansion. The grand staircase\r\nis at the inner south-east angle, and the north stairs at the inner\r\nnorth-east angle. The south side is taken up with the gallery of\r\npaintings, the chapel (at the south-west angle), the billiard-rooms,\r\nand the two drawing-rooms; the west by the gallery of paintings,\r\nthe west staircase, and suites of bed-rooms; the north side by the\r\nlibrary-corridor and sumptuous bed-rooms, &c.; and the east side by\r\ngalleries of the great hall, and the library and ante-library. The\r\nnorth wing, continuing in a line with the libraries, comprises the\r\ndining-room, sculpture-gallery, and orangery.\r\n\r\nThe GALLERY OF PAINTINGS, which occupies two sides of the quadrangle,\r\nand from which access is had to the various apartments, contains,\r\nwith the adjoining ante-room, many remarkably fine and valuable\r\nart-treasures—such, indeed, as no other mansion can boast. Among\r\nthese, it will be sufficient to name Landseer’s original paintings\r\nof “Bolton Abbey in the Olden Time,” and “Laying down the Law,” a\r\nnumber of family portraits by Reynolds, Lawrence, and others; with two\r\nremarkable representations of the old mansion, one of which we engrave\r\non page 325.\r\n\r\nThe BILLIARD or MUSIC-ROOM, and the GRAND DRAWING-ROOMS, which form one\r\ncontinued suite, are as well-proportioned, as chastely and elegantly\r\ndecorated, and as magnificently furnished, as can well be imagined,\r\nand they contain a matchless collection of works of art. In the\r\nbilliard-room, from which a door opens into the gallery of the chapel,\r\nare several remarkably good paintings, the most striking of which are\r\nan admirable full-length portrait of the present Duke of Devonshire,\r\nseated, and a full-length portrait of the father of the present noble\r\nDuke. Among the treasures of art in the drawing-room (the ornaments\r\nof the ceiling and cornices of which are richly gilt) may just be\r\nnamed Reynolds’s celebrated portrait of “the beautiful Duchess” of\r\nDevonshire, Rembrandt’s grand head of a Jewish Rabbi, and picture-gems\r\nby Claude, Murillo, Bassano, Steinwyck, Salvator Rosa, Titian, Berghem,\r\nGaspar Poussin, Leonardo da Vinci, Primaticcio, Parmigiano, Watteau,\r\nTeniers, Breughel, Guercino, Giordione, Carlo Maratti, Jan Miel, and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nIn the Grand Drawing-room, which has a splendid ceiling divided into\r\ncompartments, and, with the massive panellings of the pictures let into\r\nthe walls, is richly gilt, are some rare and priceless full-length\r\npaintings. These are Philip II., by Titian; Admiral Capella, and\r\nAntonio de Dominis, by Tintoretto; the Duke of Albemarle, by Dobson;\r\nHenry VIII., by Holbein; Mary Queen of Scots, by Zucchero; and Charles\r\nI., by Jansen. The furniture is of the most sumptuous character, and\r\nevery elegancy which the most perfect taste can desire, or the most\r\nliberal expenditure secure, adds endless charms to the room. We\r\nengrave one portion of this apartment, and also the Hebe of Canova,\r\nwith which, and other rarities, it is graced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Drawing-room._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Hebe of Canova._]\r\n\r\nFrom the south windows of this suite of rooms a magnificent view of the\r\ngrounds is obtained. Immediately beneath is the spacious lawn, bordered\r\nwith raised parterres, festoon flower-beds, and sculpture; in the\r\ncentre of the lawn is a basin with a central and four other fountains.\r\nBeyond this is seen the lake, with the “Emperor” fountain casting up\r\nits waters to an enormous height, and skirted on its sloping sides with\r\nmajestic forest trees, and with grassy slopes and statuary; the park\r\nstretching out to the right. From the east window of the drawing-room\r\nthe view is equally fine, but of different character. Here is seen, in\r\nall its beauty, the wonderful cascade shown in one of our engravings,\r\nthe waters of which come rolling down from the dome of the temple to\r\nthe head of the broad walk in the middle of the grassy slope where\r\nit disappears under the ground and is no more seen. To the right and\r\nleft beautiful glimpses of the grounds are obtained, while beneath the\r\nwindow, to the right, a flight of steps, guarded by two sculptured\r\nlions, forms a striking foreground. From this room, besides the doorway\r\nwhich connects it with apartments we have been describing, one door\r\ngives access to the grand staircase, and another to the library.\r\n\r\nOf the various apartments composing the north and west sides, it will\r\nbe unnecessary for our present purpose here to speak, further than\r\nto say that they are as sumptuously and as tastefully arranged and\r\nfurnished as such a palace with such a princely owner requires.\r\n\r\nThe LIBRARY, which is about 90 feet long by 23 in width, and of\r\ncorresponding height, is one of the most elegant, best arranged, and\r\nmost perfect libraries in existence. This noble apartment has eight\r\nwindows in length on its east side, between which are presses for\r\nbooks, surmounted by looking-glass; the opposite side and the ends are\r\nalso lined with books, and an elegant gallery, to which access is had\r\nby a concealed spiral staircase, runs along the ends and one side.\r\nThe ceiling is white and gold, and is adorned with three large, and\r\nfive smaller, circular paintings of the most exquisite colouring, by\r\nLouis Charon. The mahogany book-cases are divided into presses by gilt\r\nmetal-columns, from which stand out the brackets supporting the gallery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Library._]\r\n\r\nThe chimney-piece, of Carrara marble, has beautifully sculptured\r\ncolumns with wreaths of foliage, and is surmounted by candelabra,\r\nmassive vases, and a magnificent mirror. In the glass-cases and\r\ntable-presses, as well as on the shelves, are preserved, as may well\r\nbe supposed, one of the richest and rarest collections of books and\r\nMSS. which any house can boast. It would be an endless task, and indeed\r\nquite out of place in this work, much as we desire to linger in the\r\nroom, to attempt to give even a very brief _résumé_ of the treasures\r\nit contains. We cannot, however, resist the temptation of saying that\r\nhere is the famous Anglo-Saxon MS. of Caedmon, which is altogether,\r\nperhaps, the most important, and the finest MS. of the period. The\r\nprayer-book of Henry VII. is highly interesting, both historically and\r\nartistically. It is of 8vo size, and consists of 186 leaves of vellum,\r\non several of which are beautiful miniatures in the most exquisite\r\ncolouring and design; many of these designs, as notably, our Saviour\r\nin the act of benediction, the murder of St. Thomas A’Becket, and St.\r\nGeorge, are remarkably fine both in conception and execution. It was\r\ngiven by the king, Henry VII., to his daughter, Margaret, Queen of\r\nScotland, mother to the Lady Margaret Douglas, who in turn gave it to\r\nthe Archbishop of St. Andrew’s. It contains the following among other\r\ntouching gift lines:—\r\n\r\n “Remembre yr kynde and louyng fader in yo^r good prayers. Henry R.”\r\n\r\n “Pray for your loving father that gave you this booke and gave you\r\n God’s blessing and mine.”\r\n\r\n “My good Lorde of St. tandrews, I pray you pray for me that gave you\r\n thys bouk. Yours to my powr, Margaret,”\r\n\r\nand many other MSS. The _compotus_ of Bolton Abbey, 1287 to 1385; the\r\n“Liber Veritas” of Claude Lorraine (for which, we believe, no less\r\nthan £20,000 was at one time offered); a splendid collection of Wynkyn\r\nde Worde’s and Caxton’s printings; a marvellously fine assemblage of\r\nearly editions;—altogether, as rich, as curious, as important, and as\r\nvaluable a collection of books as can anywhere be found. We know of no\r\nplace where we should so much delight to remain as among the literary\r\ntreasures in this grand library, which has for us many hidden charms.\r\n\r\nPassing out from this splendid apartment, is the ANTE-LIBRARY, formed\r\nof two exquisitely beautiful little rooms, filled with books of the\r\ngreatest value and interest. The ceiling of the first or larger room of\r\nthese is richly gilt, and adorned with paintings by Hayter and Charles\r\nLandseer. The smaller apartment is a perfect architectural gem, of\r\napsidal form, the dome supported by a series of columns and pilasters\r\nwith Corinthian capitals. In this room are some remarkably fine\r\nvases on pedestals. From the Ante-Library a door opens on the NORTH\r\nSTAIRCASE, on which are hung a fine full-length portrait of the late\r\nDuke of Devonshire, by Sir Francis Grant; full-length portraits of the\r\nEmperor Nicholas of Russia, and of his Empress; Sir Thomas Lawrence’s\r\nfull-length portrait of George IV. in his coronation robes; and a\r\ncurious old painting, nearly life-size, of the “Flying Childers,” with\r\nthe following “certificate” of the age of the horse;—“September ye 28,\r\n1719. This is to certifie that the bay stoned horse his Grace the Duke\r\nof Devonshire bought of me was bred by me, and was five years old last\r\ngrass, and noe more. Witness my hand, Leo. Childers.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fireplace by Westmacott in the Dining-room._]\r\n\r\nThe DINING-ROOM is a large and noble apartment with a slightly\r\n“barrel-shaped” ceiling, divided into hexagonal panels filled with\r\nroses and foliated flowers richly gilt. The doors, at one end opening\r\ninto the vestibule leading into the cabinet library, and at the\r\nother into the sculpture-gallery, have their cases of white marble,\r\nthe entablatures supported on massive Ionic columns. The room is\r\nlit by five windows on its east side, and opposite to these are two\r\nexquisitely beautiful white marble chimney-pieces, each of which has\r\ntwo life-size statues, two by Westmacott and two by Sievier. Around\r\nthe room are six side-tables; two are of hornblende, two of Siberian\r\njasper, and two of porphyritic sienite. The furniture is massive and\r\nappropriate, and the walls display family portraits, chiefly by Vandyke.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Sculpture Gallery._]\r\n\r\nThe SCULPTURE GALLERY, one of the “glories” of Chatsworth, is entered\r\nfrom the dining-room at one end, and at the other opens into the\r\nOrangery. This noble gallery is 103 feet in length and 30 in width, is\r\nof proportionate height, and is lighted from the roof. The walls are of\r\nfinely-dressed sandstone, and the door-cases of Derbyshire marble; the\r\nentablatures supported by Corinthian columns and pilasters of various\r\nmarbles with gilt capitals. Of the precious treasures contained in this\r\ngallery it would be impossible, in the space we have at our disposal,\r\nto speak at length. We shall, therefore, content ourselves with simply\r\nenumerating some of the more prominent sculptures, noting that the\r\npedestals, columns, &c., are all of the most choice and valuable\r\nmaterials. Among the examples here, and in other parts of the mansion,\r\nso charmingly and effectively arranged, are the following:—\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Mater Napoleonis._]\r\n\r\nBy Canova, a statue of Endymion sleeping, his dog watching at his feet;\r\na statue of Hebe; a statue of Madame Mère, the mother of Napoleon; a\r\ncolossal bust of Napoleon; a bust of Madame Mère; a noble bust of the\r\nlate Duke of Devonshire; some female heads; and a bust of Petrarch’s\r\nLaura. By Thorwaldsen, a fine statue of Venus with the apple; a bust\r\nof Gonsalvi; _bassi-relievi_ of Day and Night; Priam petitioning\r\nAchilles for the dead body of Hector; Briseis taken from Achilles by\r\nthe heralds; and others. By Chantrey, a bust of George IV.; a bust of\r\nCanning. &c. By Schadow, a statue of the Filatrice, or Spinning-Girl;\r\nand some beautiful bas-reliefs. By Finelli, a statue of Cupid playing\r\nwith a butterfly. By Trentanove, a seated figure of Cupid in thought;\r\na relief-profile; a bust of a Vestal, after Canova. By Kessels, a fine\r\nstatue of a Discobolus or quoit-thrower. By Tadolini, a powerful\r\nstatue of Ganymede with the eagle. By Albacini, a statue of Achilles\r\nwounded. By Pozzi, a fine group of Latona reproaching the shepherds,\r\naccompanied by the young Apollo and Diana. By Tenerani, a group of\r\nCupid taking out a thorn from the foot of Venus. By Gibson, a splendid\r\ngroup of Mars and Cupid. By Wyatt, a charming statue of Musidora. By\r\nGott, a statue of Musidora; a colossal bust of Ariadne; and a group of\r\ngreyhound and puppies. By R. Westmacott, a statue of a cymbal-player;\r\nand a bas-relief of Bacchantes springing through the air. By Bartolini,\r\na recumbent statue of a Bacchante; statue of the Venus de Medici; a\r\nbust of the Countess Maria Potocka; and the Medici Vase. By Barruzzi,\r\na group of Venus and Cupid. By Prosalendi, a statue of Diana. By T.\r\nCampbell, a statue of the Princess Pauline Borghese; a bust of the\r\nsame princess; a colossal bust of the late Duke of Devonshire; a bust\r\nof Thomas, Earl of Newburgh. By Rinaldi, a bust of Ceres and a bust\r\nof a Bacchante; a colossal bust of Canova. By Rennie, a colossal bust\r\nof Achilles. By Rauch, a bust of the Emperor Nicholas. By Wickmann, a\r\nbust of the Empress Alexandra Feoderowna. By Nollekens, busts of C. J.\r\nFox; Francis, Duke of Bedford; William, fifth Duke of Devonshire; and\r\nLord George Cavendish. By Bonelli, a bust of Lady George Cavendish. By\r\nDantan Jeune, a bust of Bellini. Many of the busts here named are in\r\nthe state-rooms, and besides the sculptures we have enumerated there\r\nare many other beautiful examples of this art in various parts of the\r\nhouse and grounds. From the Sculpture Gallery—\r\n\r\nThe ORANGERY is entered by a massive doorway between two splendidly\r\ncarved colossal lions, after Canova. It is 108 feet in length and 27 in\r\nwidth, and, beside its myriads of beauties as a conservatory, contains\r\nsome exceedingly fine specimens of sculpture. From the centre of the\r\nOrangery egress is had to the grounds, and at its north end a corridor\r\n(in which are some pieces of ancient sculpture and mosaic) leads to\r\nthe baths and to a staircase which gives access to the banqueting or\r\nball-room, and the open pavilion. These are not, of course, shown to\r\nthe public; but, nevertheless, a few words may well be added concerning\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe BALL-ROOM, or BANQUETING-ROOM, as it is sometimes called, is a\r\nmagnificent apartment, 81 feet long by 30 in width, and very lofty.\r\nThe ceiling is divided into compartments, each of which contains\r\na beautiful painting set in richly-gilt framing; the whole of the\r\nintermediate parts being painted in fresco, with medallions of crest\r\nand coronet and monogram of the Duke. Prominent among the subjects\r\non the ceiling are Sir James Thornhill’s “Perseus and Andromeda,”\r\npaintings by Louis Charon, and a view of Chatsworth, with allegorical\r\nfigures in the front. Over this room is the open PAVILION, from which\r\nextensive and charming views of the surrounding country are obtained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Pavilion and Orangery, from the East._]\r\n\r\nThe lower, or BASEMENT STORY, remains to be noticed. This, like the\r\nother stories we have described, runs round the four sides of the\r\nquadrangle of the main building; the basement of the north wing being\r\ndevoted to the kitchens and domestic and business offices. The grand\r\nstaircase occupies the inner south-east angle, the grand hall and\r\nvarious private apartments taking up the east side. On the north is\r\nthe entrance, the sub-hall, the north corridor, and various private\r\napartments. The west front is occupied by the Duke’s private suite of\r\nrooms, the Marquis of Hartington’s private rooms, the west entrance,\r\nthe west staircase, and corridor. The south side comprises the south\r\ncorridor, the Chapel at the south-west corner, the Oak Room, the south\r\nentrance, the Stag Parlour, and other apartments. It will only be our\r\nprovince on this story (having already described the sub-hall, north\r\ncorridor, and grand hall), to speak of the corridors, the Chapel, and\r\ncursorily of one or two other of the apartments on this floor. Passing\r\nbeneath the grand staircase in the great hall is the “GROTTO ROOM,”\r\nthe ceiling of which, supported by four massive pillars and twelve\r\npilasters, is divided into compartments; some of them being enriched\r\nby the _insignia_ of the Order of the Garter. Opposite the entrance is\r\na boldly and powerfully sculptured fountain-piece, the central subject\r\nof which is Venus at the Bath; the accessories being dolphins, crabs,\r\nlobsters, fish, and other appropriate objects. To the east of this\r\nroom is an ante-room giving access to the south-east sitting-room (a\r\ncharming apartment filled with interesting pictures and other works of\r\nart), and to the apartments on the east, as well as to the grounds. On\r\nthe west is the SOUTH CORRIDOR, from which doors open into the various\r\nrooms on this side. In this corridor are several curious old paintings,\r\nand it is further adorned with bronzes and some splendidly-carved\r\nantique coffers. In the centre of this corridor a door opens into\r\nthe OAK ROOM, and, although this is not shown to visitors, it is so\r\ntruly and strikingly beautiful that we cannot resist the temptation\r\nof just alluding to it. This was formerly the “Chaplain’s Room,” but\r\nby the good taste of its late noble owner was altered and made what\r\nit certainly now is, one of the gems of the house. It is lined on all\r\nsides with the most magnificent old oak carving of panels, figures,\r\nbusts, &c.; and the ceiling is supported by four majestic twisted oak\r\npillars, with composite capitals, carved in foliage, and reminding\r\none forcibly of Raffaelle’s celebrated cartoon. The entablature is\r\nheraldic: it is composed of thirty shields of arms, emblazoned in their\r\nproper colours. The lower part of the “wooden walls” are arranged as\r\nbook-cases, and above these the panels are doubly filled with a series\r\nof beautiful landscapes and sea-pieces, by Carmichael. The centre of\r\nthe floor, within the oak piers, is of oak parqueterie; the remainder\r\nis filled with tiles, in imitation of tesselated pavement. Adjoining\r\nthis room is the Chapel.\r\n\r\nThe CHAPEL at Chatsworth, which occupies the south-west angle of the\r\nmansion, is perhaps the most striking and peculiar to be seen in any of\r\nthe “stately homes” of our country. Its arrangement also—for its altar\r\nis at the _west_ end—is somewhat unusual, and its decorations are of\r\nthe most exquisitely beautiful character. This elegant chapel is 47\r\nfeet 4 inches in length by 23 feet 10 inches in width, and in height\r\nit occupies two entire stories, reaching from the ground-floor up to\r\nthe floor of the upper, or state-room, story. At its east end, midway\r\nin height, and communicating with the gallery of paintings and with the\r\nbilliard-room, is a gallery supported upon two massive pillars of black\r\nmarble, with white marble capitals and bases. The chapel is lighted\r\nby three windows on the upper story. The floor is paved with marble,\r\nand the altar-piece is also of marble; the pillar and steps of black,\r\nand the remainder of white marble. On the sides are two fine figures\r\nof Faith and Hope, by Caius Gabriel Cibber (father of Colley Cibber),\r\nwho was much employed at Chatsworth from 1688 to 1690, or thereabouts,\r\nand who, besides these marble figures, carved two large Sphinxes,\r\nstatues of Pallas, Apollo, a Triton, and other figures. The top of the\r\naltar-piece is exquisitely sculptured with cherubs and festoons, and at\r\nthe sides are vases of flowers. In the lower pediment or recess is a\r\ndove, and there are also some charming figures of cherubs, &c.; under\r\nthe recess is a most chaste and beautiful bust of our Saviour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Carving over one of the Doors of the Chapel._]\r\n\r\nThe chapel is wainscoted throughout in its lower story with cedar,\r\nwhich, besides its beautiful rich colour, gives a peculiar yet very\r\ngrateful odour to the place, and accords well with the subdued light\r\nand its general effect. The reading-desk also is of cedar. The ceiling\r\nand the upper story of the apartment are painted in the same remarkably\r\nfine manner as those of the state-rooms, by Verrio and Laguerre; the\r\nsubjects being, “The Incredibility of St. Thomas,” “Christ and the\r\nWoman of Samaria,” “Christ Healing the Blind,” and the “Ascension of\r\nour Saviour.” There are, also, figures of the Christian attributes,\r\nJustice, Mercy, Charity, and Liberality.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Carving over one of the Doors of the Chapel._]\r\n\r\nThe great glory, artistically, however, of the Chapel at Chatsworth,\r\nand, indeed, as we have already said, of the state-rooms of this noble\r\npile, are the splendid wood-carvings which adorn its walls and the\r\nheads of its upper doors. Between the large panels of the cedar walls\r\nare exquisite pendants, ten in number, and others occur on each side of\r\nthe altar. The pendants consist of flowers, fruit, foliage, and corn,\r\nfestooned and entwined with drapery in the most free and graceful\r\nmanner, and so true to nature in every detail as to be deceptive.\r\nOver the doors in the gallery are fine figures of Cupids with musical\r\ninstruments. These, and some of the pendants, we engrave.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Carvings in the Chapel._]\r\n\r\nAnd now it becomes necessary to say a word or two as to the authors\r\nof these and the other exquisite carvings which adorn the rooms of\r\nChatsworth. Those in the chapel, as well as some others, are generally\r\nbelieved and generally stated to be by Grinling Gibbons; and if\r\nmarvellous skill in execution, masterly conception, delicate handling,\r\nand purity of design, be any special characteristic of the work of\r\nthat great genius, then, most assuredly, there is sufficient in these\r\nexamples to lead the most able judges to appropriate them to him;\r\njudgment, however, and popular belief must not be allowed to usurp the\r\nplace of facts, and it is an undoubted fact that in the accounts of\r\nthe building of Chatsworth, although the names of all the more noted\r\nartists and contractors appear, that of Grinling Gibbons does not, it\r\nis stated, once occur; still it is possible that work might have been\r\ndone by him, and it is conjectured that as the sum of £14 15_s._ was\r\npaid to Henry Lobb, the carpenter, for cases in which some _carved\r\nwork_, statues, and pictures, were conveyed to Chatsworth from London,\r\nthis carved work _might_ be by Gibbons.\r\n\r\nThe principal wood-carvers were Thomas Young, William Davies, Joel\r\nLobb, and Samuel Watson, to the latter of whom is undoubtedly due\r\nthe credit of much of the work which has of late been ascribed to\r\nGibbons. Those who have admired the exquisite carving of flowers, dead\r\ngame, fish, nets, festoons, &c., in the State Dining-room, to which\r\nwe have alluded, and have considered them to be by the master-hand of\r\nGibbons, will perhaps learn, with some little surprise, that they are\r\nthe creations of the genius of Watson (a Derbyshire worthy), and his\r\nco-labourers, Lobb and Davies. The following is the memorandum relating\r\nto the agreement as to this work, contained in the original book of\r\nwork done by Watson from 1690 to 1712. “Sept. 9, 1692. Joel Lobb,\r\nWilliam Davies, and Samuel Watson agreed with the Earl of Devonshire\r\nto execute in lime-tree, the carving of the great chamber, to be done\r\nequal to anything of the kind before executed, for which they were to\r\nreceive £400; this carving consists of flowers, wreaths, dead game,\r\ncherubs,” &c. The original designs by Watson for some of the carving in\r\nthis room (as well as in others) are preserved.\r\n\r\nSamuel Watson was born at Heanor, in Derbyshire, in 1662, and is said\r\nto have studied under—indeed to have been an apprentice of—C. Oakley,\r\nin London. Soon after completing his apprenticeship he commenced work\r\nat Chatsworth, and here he continued to be employed, as the accounts\r\nshow, until 1712, only three years before his death, which took place\r\nin 1715. He was buried at his native village, Heanor, where a tablet\r\nremains to his memory, bearing the following verse:—\r\n\r\n  “Watson is gone, whose skilful Art display’d\r\n  To the very life whatever Nature made;\r\n  View but his wondrous works in Chatsworth hall,\r\n  Which are so gazed at and admired of all\r\n  You’ll say ‘tis pity he should hidden lie,\r\n  And nothing said to revive his memory.\r\n  My mournful friends, forbear your tears,\r\n  For I shall rise when Christ appears.\r\n\r\n “This SAMUEL WATSON died 29th March, 1715, aged 53 years.”\r\n\r\nThere is nothing, so far as we are aware, to show by whom the carvings\r\nin the chapel were executed, but they have been pronounced by competent\r\njudges, and by no less an authority in late years than Mr. Rogers, to\r\nbe the work of Gibbons. The probability is they are by him, and it is\r\nalso equally probable that he was the presiding genius of the place,\r\nsupplying designs, and, besides working himself, directing the labours\r\nof others. We regret that space will not admit of our speaking at\r\ngreater length upon this tempting and fascinating subject; but, giving\r\none or two engravings of portions of the carvings,[39] we must now pass\r\non to say a few words concerning the exquisite modern decorations of\r\nthe private library and rooms adjoining.\r\n\r\nThe WEST LIBRARY and the LEATHER ROOM are, without exception, the\r\nmost purely elegant and chaste in their fittings and decorations of\r\nany apartments we know, and nothing could possibly exceed the purity\r\nof taste displayed in them. The ceiling of the Library is delicately\r\nfrescoed in arabesque foliage, and groups of figures in rich colours,\r\nand the spaces between the book-presses are similarly decorated.\r\nAmong the decorations of the ceiling are several beautifully painted\r\nmedallion-heads of Virgilius Maro, Marcus Tullius Cicero, Horatius\r\nFlaccus, Titus Livius, and others: over the book-cases are also\r\nmedallion-portraits, supported by figures and foliage, of famous poets,\r\nwith appropriate sentiments: thus, over Shakspeare occurs “Exhausted\r\nworlds and then imagined new;” over Milton, “A Poet blind yet bold;”\r\nByron, “The wandering outlaw of his own brave land;” Scott, “The\r\nAriosto of the North;” Chaucer, “Well of English undefiled;” Thomson,\r\n“As Nature various, and as Art complete,” and so on. The doors of this\r\nand the adjoining room are so arranged with imitation book-backs, that,\r\nwhen they are closed, it is impossible to see any means of egress or\r\ningress. The books on these doors (like those in the Great Library)\r\nhave fictitious names, many of which, written by Hood, although perhaps\r\nnot in good keeping with the excellent taste of the rest of the\r\nfittings, are extremely amusing, and worthy of his inimitable vein of\r\nhumour. Of these it is difficult to resist giving an example or two.\r\nHere they are:—“Horn Took on Catching Cows;” “Wren’s Voyage to the\r\nCanaries;” “Dyspepsia and Heartburn, by the Bishop of Sodor;” “Dibdin’s\r\nCream of Tar;” “Minto’s Coins;” “Merry’s Gay;” “Esterhazy on Spring\r\nFogs;” “Inigo Jones on Secret Entrances;” “Hyde upon Wood;” “Macadam’s\r\nRhodes;” “Egg, by Shelley;” “Skye, by McCloud;” “Bramah’s Rape of the\r\nLock;” “Beveridge on the Beer Act;” “D. Cline on Consumption,” and many\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Private or West Library._]\r\n\r\nThe “Leather Room” has its walls and ceiling formed entirely of\r\nembossed leather richly gilt; the ceiling heightened in medallions\r\nwith blue ground and relief-painted figures, and with richly decorated\r\npendants. Adjoining these rooms is the West Entrance, the floor of\r\nwhich is of mosaic, and the ceiling bears an allegorical painting of\r\nthe Arts; in the centre is Architecture, holding a drawing of the west\r\nfront of Chatsworth, crowned by Fame, and beneath are Cupids with plan\r\nof Chatsworth, and compasses, &c. In the coving are Cupids, and on the\r\nwalls hang some interesting pictures.\r\n\r\nIn the West Corridor are preserved some highly-interesting Roman\r\ninscribed sepulchral stones, and other sculptures. One of these is\r\ninscribed:—\r\n\r\n  “DIS MANIBVS\r\n  LUCCIAE · NYMPHICES\r\n  QVAE · VIXIT · ANNIS · XVIII\r\n          FECIT\r\n  M · ATILIVS · PHILOLOGVS\r\n          CONIVGI\r\n  CARISSIMAE\r\n              ET · SIBI.”\r\n\r\nAnd another is inscribed as follows:—\r\n\r\n        “DIS MANIBVS\r\n    TI · CLAVDI · THALLIANI\r\n  VIX · AN · XX · DIEB · XX\r\n      CLAVDIA · FELICVLA\r\n        MATER · FILIO\r\n          PIISIMO.”\r\n\r\nIn the West Lodge, at the entrance gates, are also preserved many\r\nfragments of ancient sculpture, and a portion of a Roman tesselated\r\npavement with _guilloche_ pattern and other borders. Among the\r\nsculptures is a marble cinerary urn bearing the following inscription:—\r\n\r\n              “DIS MANIBVS\r\n      CARIIAPMIIB MVSA F · APOIII\r\n    NARIS · PATRONVS CONIVGI BENI\r\n  MIRENII H IVIIA MYRAMAIIRE F PIIS.”\r\n\r\nAnother cinerary urn is inscribed:—\r\n\r\n  “D M\r\n  REMNO.”\r\n\r\nThere are also other portions of inscriptions, and among the more\r\ninteresting of these remains are:—A fine _torso_ of Venus, and\r\nanother _torso_ of a female, of very similar dimensions; the head of\r\na stag, life-size, presented to the Duchess of Devonshire by the King\r\nof Naples; heads of fawns, of Jupiter, of a Cupid, of Silenus, &c.;\r\npart of a colossal medallion of Lucius Verus; a bas-relief of Bacchus,\r\nsupported by a younger male figure; an _alto-relievo_ of a procession\r\nof Silenus, in which that god is shown seated on a chariot, and leaning\r\non a young Bacchante, and a fawn is playing on the double pipe; a\r\nnumber of architectural ornaments; some fine masks and portions of\r\nmasks; an _alto-relievo_ of three female figures and the dog Cerberus;\r\na fragment representing Diana and Actæon; two right hands, one grasping\r\nthe other firmly, as if struggling in wrestling or fighting; some\r\nEgyptian figures, &c., and many other fragments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Sculpture Gallery and Orangery._]\r\n\r\nAbove the Lodge, too, some good architectural and other fragments of\r\nsculpture are preserved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Bust of the late Duke of Devonshire._]\r\n\r\nThe gardens and grounds of Chatsworth are marvels of beauty, and are,\r\nindeed, in many respects, matchless both for their picturesqueness,\r\ntheir elegance, and the skill with which they have been laid out.\r\nLeaving the mansion from the door of the Orangery, to the left is a\r\nspacious alcove, and to the right, running in a direct line for more\r\nthan a quarter of a mile in length, is a broad gravel path, at the\r\nsummit of which, beneath a lofty avenue of trees, is seen a gigantic\r\nvase, bearing the simple name of “Blanche,” in touching memory of the\r\nmuch-loved and accomplished Lady Blanche Georgiana Howard, the wife of\r\nthe present Duke of Devonshire.\r\n\r\nFrom this spot the view on all sides is truly grand (embracing the\r\nmansion, the gardens, the lakes, basins and fountains, the woods and\r\nshrubberies, the park and the river, and the distant country towards\r\nRowsley), and paths lead in various directions among the beauties of\r\nthe place: here a delightful little dell or a fernery where ferns and\r\nheaths grow in wild profusion, there another dell of rhododendrons, or\r\nwith statuary among heathery banks and masses of rock. Near here, too,\r\nis a sylvan slope, headed by a gigantic bronze bust of the late Duke,\r\nmounted on a pillar, composed of fragments of an ancient Greek fluted\r\ncolumn from the Temple of Minerva at Sunium. On the base are these\r\nbeautiful verses by Lord Carlisle:—\r\n\r\n  “These fragments stood on Sunium’s airy steep;\r\n  They reared aloft Minerva’s guardian shrine;\r\n  Beneath them rolled the blue Egean deep;\r\n  And the Greek pilot hail’d them as divine.\r\n\r\n  “Such was, e’en then, their look of calm repose.\r\n  As wafted round them came the sounds of fight,\r\n  When the glad shouts of conquering Athens rose\r\n  O’er the long track of Persia’s broken flight.\r\n\r\n  “Tho’ clasped by prostrate worshippers no more,\r\n  They yet shall breathe a thrilling lesson here;\r\n  Tho’ distant from their own immortal shore,\r\n  The spot they grace is still to freedom dear.”\r\n\r\nOf this classic pedestal, with its crowning bust, we give an engraving\r\non the preceding page.\r\n\r\nOpposite to the Orangery is the FRENCH GARDEN, with its forest of\r\npillars surmounted by busts, its grand old Egyptian figures, its\r\nChinese beakers and vases, its sculptured figures and groups, and its\r\nraised parterres: near this are green-houses, conservatories, and\r\ncamelia and orchid houses, with their endless store of beauties; while\r\nhere and there an antique tomb, or sculptured figures, or groups of\r\nstatuary, add their charms to the place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The French Garden._]\r\n\r\nFrom above this part of the gardens a broad path to the right leads on\r\nto the Great Conservatory, passing on its way the Cascade, the Willow\r\nTree, and other interesting spots. The Grand Cascade, of which we\r\ngive an engraving, the Willow Tree, and other parts of the artificial\r\nwater-works, were designed and executed, as already stated, in the\r\nearly part of last century, by M. Grillet, and added to and repaired\r\nby the late Duke, under the direction of Sir J. Paxton. The water\r\nsupplying the Great Cascade, the fountains, and the other portions of\r\nthe works, falls, as will be seen in our engraving, from the summit of\r\nthe wooded heights at the back of the grounds, and is then conveyed\r\nalong a lofty arched aqueduct, from the end of which it falls with\r\nconsiderable force, and is then carried underground to the temple, at\r\nthe head of the cascade. Here it rises to the domed roof of the temple,\r\nwhich becomes a sheet of water, and, rushing through the various carved\r\nchannels prepared for it in the groups of figures, &c., makes its way\r\ndown the cascade, formed of a long series of stone steps with flats at\r\nregular intervals, and at the bottom sinks into a subterranean channel\r\nat the spectator’s feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Great Cascade._]\r\n\r\nThe Temple, which is open, is of circular form in its interior, with\r\nrecess and niches with stone seats, the niches enriched with carved\r\nshell-heads and festoons of flowers. Externally, an open temple\r\nsupported on six pillars surmounts the dome. In front, over the central\r\narch, is a powerfully-carved recumbent figure of Neptune holding an\r\nurn; below him, on either side, is an immense dolphin, with head\r\ndownwards; and on the sides are water-nymphs with vases. On either side\r\nthe open archway is a gigantic dolphin’s head, and at the base are\r\ndragons. From the whole of these figures and heads the water rushes\r\nout, and, simultaneously, two beautiful fountains rise in front of the\r\ntemple.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Alcove._]\r\n\r\nIn the grounds not far from this temple is a charming ALCOVE of\r\nMoresque design, which forms a beautiful retreat, at a bend in the\r\ndrive, with a pleasant little rill running down near it. The front\r\nof the alcove is formed of two horse-shoe shaped arches supported on\r\ngranite pillars, the spandrels carved with monograms; on the ceiling\r\nare the Cavendish arms and motto twice repeated. On the wall inside are\r\ntwo tablets, one bearing the following lines:—\r\n\r\n  “Won from the brow of yonder headlong hill,\r\n  Through grassy channels, see the sparkling rill\r\n  O’er the chafed pebbles, in its murmuring flow,\r\n  Sheds freshness on the thirsty vale below,\r\n  Quick’ning the ground till trees of every zone\r\n  In Chatsworth’s soil and clime, forget their own.”\r\n\r\n  H. L. Sept. MDCCCXXXIX.\r\n\r\nOn the other is this inscription:—\r\n\r\n  “Ecce, supercilio clivosi tramitis undam\r\n  Elicit: illa cadens raucum per levia murmur\r\n  Saxa ciet, scatebrisque arentia temperat arva.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Waterworks—The Willow Tree._]\r\n\r\nThe WILLOW-TREE, one of the most striking and clever of the\r\nwater-works, is a weeping willow, about twenty feet in height, entirely\r\nformed of copper and lead, and coloured in imitation of a real tree. It\r\nstands in a charming little circular dell, overhung with forest-trees,\r\nand surrounded by banks and rockeries covered with luxuriant ferns and\r\nother plants, itself rising from a central rock-work, around which runs\r\na path. At the entrance to this little dell are a vase and fountain,\r\nand at the opposite side is a leaden statue of Pan, holding in his hand\r\nthe Pandean pipes, and having a goat at his feet. From each leaf and\r\nstem of this remarkable tree, the water, when turned on from a small\r\nhidden cave in the rock in front, rushes out in a rapid stream, and\r\nthus forms a novel kind of “shower-bath” to any luckless visitor who\r\nmay happen to be beneath it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Part of the Rock-work._]\r\n\r\nAt the same time, a number of jets rise up from hidden pipes all around\r\nthe dell, and these streams being directed angularly upwards towards\r\nthe centre, while those from the tree fall in all directions downwards,\r\nthere is no way of escape without being caught in the heavy shower. Of\r\nthis tree we give an engraving from a photograph taken specially for\r\nthe purpose, with others of our illustrations, by Mr. George Green, of\r\nWorthing, an eminent photographic artist, whom we specially engaged for\r\nthese Chatsworth views, and whose skill deserves high commendation.\r\nNear the Willow-tree, passing onwards towards the grand conservatory,\r\nis a rocky archway of wondrous construction, and a little beyond this\r\na “rocky portal”—an immense block of unhewn stone, turning upon an\r\naxis with such ease as to be moved with the pressure of a single finger.\r\n\r\nPassing through this portal, one of the next most striking objects is\r\na perpendicular rock, of great altitude, down whose face a stream of\r\nwater is for ever falling, and this water supplies some charming little\r\nlakes filled with aquatic plants, in whose windings and intricacies the\r\nbotanist and lover of nature might revel for hours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Great Conservatory._]\r\n\r\nThe GREAT CONSERVATORY, one of the wonders of Chatsworth, besides its\r\nown attraction as the finest conservatory in the kingdom, possesses\r\nan historical interest as being the first of its kind ever erected,\r\nand from which the idea of the Great Exhibition building of 1851, and\r\nall the later exhibition buildings, including the “Crystal Palace” at\r\nSydenham, was taken. This splendid conservatory was erected some years\r\nago by Sir Joseph, at that time Mr., Paxton, and is, in its interior,\r\n277 feet in length, 123 feet in width, and no fewer than 67 feet in\r\nheight in its centre. Its form is that of a trefoil; the transverse\r\nsection showing a semicircle 70 feet in diameter, rising from two\r\nsegments of circles springing from breast-walls. The whole building is\r\nof glass, constructed on the “ridge and furrow” principle, with iron\r\nribs. About 70,000 square feet of glass are used in this gigantic\r\nbuilding, and the iron sash ribs alone are calculated to extend, if\r\nlaid together lengthways, no less than forty miles. At each end is a\r\nlarge doorway, and along the centre is a wide carriage-drive, so that\r\nseveral carriages can, on any special occasion, as on the Queen’s\r\nvisit in 1843, be within the building at the same time. Besides the\r\ncentral drive, there are side-aisles running the entire length, and\r\na cross-aisle in the centre of the building. A light and elegant\r\ngallery also runs round the entire interior, and is approached by a\r\nstaircase hidden among the rockery. Of the collection of trees and\r\nplants preserved in this giant conservatory, it is not necessary to\r\nspeak further than to say that from the smallest aquatic plants up to\r\nthe most stately palm-trees, and from the banana down to the papyrus\r\nand the delicate ferns, every conceivable rarity and beauty is here,\r\nflourishing in native luxuriance and in endless profusion. Beneath the\r\nconservatory a railway runs around the entire building, for fuel and\r\nother purposes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Part of the Rock-work—the Rocky Portal._]\r\n\r\nNot far from the conservatory, and approached by a path between tall\r\nand stately yew hedges, is a sweetly pretty circular pool of water,\r\nwith central fountain, filled with water-lilies, and surrounded\r\nfirst by a broad circular band of grass, then by a broad encircling\r\ngravel-path, edged on half its circumference with a closely-cut yew\r\nhedge with arched entrances, and the other half planted at regular\r\nintervals with cypress-trees. This, however, is but one of many\r\ncharming spots which characterize the grounds at Chatsworth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Emperor Fountain._]\r\n\r\nThe EMPEROR FOUNTAIN is one of the great attractions of Chatsworth,\r\nand one that to see is to remember. This marvellous fountain throws\r\nup a thick jet of water no fewer than 267 feet in height, which,\r\nspreading out as it falls, forms a liquid sheet of spray, on which, not\r\nunfrequently, the sunlight produces an exquisite rainbow. The quantity\r\nof metal, we are told, required in the formation of the pipes, &c.,\r\nfor this gigantic work, amounts to nearly 220 tons. The force of the\r\nwater is so great that it is said to rush out of the pipe at the rate\r\nof a hundred miles a minute. Near the “Emperor” are other fountains\r\nof great beauty, and when all are playing, the effect is beyond\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Garden on the West Front._]\r\n\r\nOf the truly elegant and indeed wondrous gardens and parterres on the\r\nwest and south fronts of the mansion, and of the thousand and one\r\nother attractions of the place, we have not time to speak, so lengthy\r\nhas our article upon this “Palace of the Peak” already become; but\r\nthere are yet two or three objects before passing out into the outer\r\ngrounds and the kitchen-garden &c., on which we must say a word. These\r\nare the trees that were planted by royalty, and which most loyally\r\nhave been tended, and grown up to a wondrous size. One of these is an\r\noak-tree planted (well do we remember the circumstance, and the pretty,\r\nsimple, earnest, and interesting appearance of the youthful princess\r\nat the time) in 1832, by our present beloved Queen, when, as a child\r\nof thirteen, then the “Princess Victoria,” she visited Chatsworth,\r\nwith her august mother the Duchess of Kent. This tree, which in its\r\nforty years’ growth has become a stately oak, bears the label,—“This\r\nOak planted by Princess Victoria, October 11th, 1832.” Near it is a\r\nSpanish chestnut thus labelled—“Spanish chestnut, planted by the\r\nDuchess of Kent, October 17th, 1832.” Then comes a sycamore planted\r\nwhen the Queen and the Prince Consort, “Albert the Good,” visited\r\nChatsworth in 1843; it is labelled—“This Sycamore planted by Prince\r\nAlbert, 1843.” In another part of the garden, opposite the west front,\r\nare a “Sweet Chestnut, planted by the (late) Emperor of Russia, 1816;”\r\nand a “Variegated Sycamore, planted by the Archduke Michael of Russia,\r\n1818.” A tree was also planted by H. R. H. the Prince of Wales, on the\r\nvisit of himself and H. R. H. the Princess of Wales, to Chatsworth, in\r\nDecember, 1872.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _West Front from the South._]\r\n\r\nChatsworth Park and grounds, from the Baslow Lodge on the north to\r\nEdensor Mill Lodge on the south, and from the East Moor on the east to\r\nHolme Wood on the west, are somewhere about ten miles in circumference,\r\nand comprise an area, in round numbers, of about 1,200 acres; and it\r\nwould be difficult to find anywhere, in the same space, so great\r\na variety of scenery ranging from the purely sylvan to the wildly\r\nromantic, and from the luxuriant wood to the rugged and barren rock,\r\nwhere beauties of one kind or other crowd together so thickly, or where\r\nsuch a charming alternation from one phase to another exists. But it\r\nis impossible even briefly to attempt to speak of these beauties—our\r\nengravings will have shown some of their features; others must be left\r\nfor the eye of the visitor to revel in while there. On one or two more\r\npoints only can we touch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Hunting Tower._]\r\n\r\nThe HUNTING TOWER, which forms so conspicuous an object in the\r\nlandscape, crowning the wooded heights at the back of the house, and\r\nfrom which floats a huge flag whenever the Duke is at Chatsworth, was\r\nbuilt in the reign of Queen Elizabeth as a prospect-tower, from which\r\nthe ladies of the family, and guests, might watch the progress of\r\nthe chase. It is a massive erection, of square form, with a circular\r\nturret at each angle, and is about ninety feet in height; it commands a\r\nmagnificent prospect on every side. Near it, by the lake, or reservoir,\r\nis the SWISS COTTAGE—a perfect cottage ornée.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Mary Queen of Scots’ Bower._]\r\n\r\nQUEEN MARY’S BOWER is one of the best-known objects in the park,\r\nbeing situated near the drive leading from the bridge to the house,\r\nand at a short distance only from the banks of the river Derwent.\r\nThis interesting relic of the unfortunate queen is a raised enclosure\r\nsurrounded by a deep moat, and approached by a flight of steps which\r\nbridge over the water on its south side. Externally the “bower,”\r\noverhung with trees and covered here and there with ivy which reaches\r\nup to its open balustrade, is highly picturesque; internally it is a\r\npleasant enclosed grassy retreat, rendered shady by the trees which\r\ngrow in and around it.\r\n\r\nThe KITCHEN GARDENS lie to the left of the drive from the house to\r\nBaslow, and near to the banks of the Derwent. They are of great\r\nextent, and of the most perfectly scientific character in the\r\narrangements—indeed, it would be impossible to find finer or better\r\nconstructed gardens attached to any mansion. At the entrance to\r\nthe gardens, shortly after passing through the lodge, is the house\r\nformerly inhabited by the late Sir Joseph Paxton, M.P., who was head\r\ngardener to the late Duke of Devonshire. This house, originally a fit\r\ndwelling-place for the head gardener of such a grand establishment as\r\nChatsworth, but which had “grown with the greatness” of Sir Joseph\r\nuntil it became in itself an elegant mansion, is now very properly\r\naltered and divided into two residences. Sir Joseph Paxton, whose\r\ncareer was marked with great success, was born at Milton Bryant, in\r\nBedfordshire, on the 3rd of August, 1803, his father, a small farmer,\r\nbeing a tenant of the Duke of Bedford.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Late Sir Joseph Paxton’s House._]\r\n\r\nSir Joseph was brought up to be a gardener, and was, when quite a boy,\r\ntaken under the care of his elder brother, at that time head gardener\r\nat Wimbledon House. When a little more than twenty years of age he\r\nwas placed in the Horticultural Gardens at Chiswick, and, being quick\r\nand clever, he had the charge of a plant-range committed to his care.\r\nThese grounds joined those of the Duke of Devonshire’s seat, Chiswick\r\nHouse, and his grace, finding young Paxton attentive and intelligent,\r\ntook much notice of him. The result was that his grace, a short time\r\nbefore leaving England as Ambassador to Russia, made an engagement with\r\nhim. In May, 1826, shortly after the Duke’s return, Paxton entered\r\nupon his new duties as head gardener at Chatsworth, being at that time\r\nabout twenty-three years of age. In the following year he married Miss\r\nSarah Bown, and soon after was made forester, and next, manager, of\r\nthe parks, and of the game department, and was consulted by his noble\r\nemployer upon most subjects connected with the household and estates,\r\nand ultimately, he added to his already important offices that of agent\r\nfor the home district of Chatsworth.\r\n\r\nIn 1831, Mr. Paxton, in conjunction with Mr. Harrison, commenced the\r\npublication of “The Horticultural Register.” Other works followed,\r\nincluding his “Magazine of Botany,” a “Practical Treatise on the\r\nCulture of the Dahlia,” a “Pocket Botanical Dictionary,” the “Flower\r\nGarden,” and others, and these will undoubtedly remain standard works.\r\nDuring the whole of this time, and to the time of the death of the\r\nduke, Mr. Paxton’s mind was actively engaged, and his energy constantly\r\nemployed, in the improvement of the gardens and grounds at Chatsworth,\r\nand the erection of the grand conservatory and other plant-houses,\r\n&c. In 1851 he brought his talents to bear in a national matter—the\r\ndesigning and erecting of the Great Exhibition building of that year,\r\ntaking as his model the conservatory which, on his own design in every\r\nparticular, he had a few years before erected. In the same year he\r\nwas knighted by the Queen, at Windsor, on the 23rd of October, and\r\nin 1854 was elected M.P. for the City of Coventry. Sir Joseph Paxton\r\ndesigned the present Crystal Palace, and it is not too much to say that\r\nto his principle of glass buildings, of a wide span, and glazed on\r\nthe ridge-and-furrow principle (invented by him), there is scarcely a\r\nrailway-station, conservatory, or large public hall or pavilion, that\r\ndoes not trace its origin. Sir Joseph died in 1865, and Lady Paxton in\r\n1871.\r\n\r\nOf the interior of the VICTORIA REGIA HOUSE we give an engraving,\r\nshowing the gigantic leaf and flower of this royal plant, which was\r\nfirst grown, and first flowered, at Chatsworth, and named after our\r\nbeloved Queen, to whom the first flower was presented in 1849. Besides\r\nthe “Victoria Regia House,” other points of interest in the kitchen\r\ngardens are the “New Holland House,” the “Amherstia House,” the “Pine\r\nHouses” and the “Vineries.” The kitchen gardens are not, of course,\r\nopen to visitors.\r\n\r\nThe village of EDENSOR, closely adjoining the park, was, with the\r\nexception of the church and one or two houses, removed to its present\r\nposition from its former site in the park some forty years ago. It\r\nis, indeed, the most perfect model village we have ever seen, and the\r\nbeauty of its villas—for every cottage in the place _is_ a villa—the\r\ncharm of its scenery, and the peace and quietness which seem to\r\nreign in and around it, make it as near an _Eden_ on earth as one\r\ncan expect any place to be, and to which its name most curiously and\r\nappropriately points. Edensor is entered by a very picturesque lodge\r\nfrom the park, and the outlet at its upper extremity is also closed by\r\ngates, so that the only thoroughfare through the place is a highway\r\nto Bakewell. Besides the Agent’s house, there are in Edensor a good\r\nparsonage house and a village school, but, luckily, there is neither a\r\nvillage ale-house, blacksmith’s forge, wheelwright’s shop, or any other\r\ngossiping place; and unpleasant sights and discordant sounds are alike\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Victoria Regia._]\r\n\r\nThe old church of Edensor was taken down a few years ago, and the\r\npresent one, from the design of Gilbert Scott, erected on its site by\r\nhis grace the present Duke of Devonshire. The old church consisted\r\nof a nave with side aisles and a chancel, and it had a square\r\nbattlemented tower at its west end. The nave and western porch were\r\nalso battlemented; the battlements being carried over the gable of the\r\nchancel-arch, in the centre of which was a niche for a sanctus-bell.\r\nThe east window was of decorative character, as were those at the east\r\nend of the south aisle, and one near the priests’ door on the south\r\nside of the chancel. Interiorly the church possessed many interesting\r\nfeatures, including some remarkable capitals, which have mostly been\r\npreserved, with the curious monuments, in the new edifice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Edensor Church and Village._]\r\n\r\nThe present church, completed in 1870, is a remarkably fine and elegant\r\nstructure, with a lofty tower and broach spire at its west end; of it\r\nwe give an engraving, as seen from the upper part of the village, from\r\na photograph by Mr. E. F. Bampton, of Edensor. It consists of a nave\r\nwith side aisles, a chancel, and a monumental chapel opening from the\r\nsouth side of the chancel. The font, which is of marble, and extremely\r\nchaste and beautiful, is at the west end, and the pulpit, which also\r\nis of marble, is placed against the chancel-arch. In the chancel are\r\nvery elegant _sedilia_, and the floor is laid with encaustic tiles.\r\nOne of the most historically interesting remains in this church is a\r\nbrass plate in the chancel to the memory of John Beton, one of the\r\nhousehold and confidential servants of Mary Queen of Scots, who died at\r\nChatsworth while his royal mistress was a captive there, in 1570. At\r\nthe head of the plate are the arms of Beton (who was of the same family\r\nas Cardinal David Beton, who took so prominent a part in the affairs\r\nof Scotland in the reign of James V. and of Mary, and of James Beton,\r\nArchbishop of St. Andrew’s), quarterly first and fourth a fesse between\r\nthree mascles; second and third, on a chevron an otter’s head, erased;\r\nwith the crest a talbot’s head. At the bottom is a figure of Beton,\r\nin plate armour, lying dead upon a pallet, his hands by his side and\r\nhis head resting on a pillow. Of this historically interesting brass\r\nwe give a careful engraving on the opposite page. For this, with some\r\nother illustrations, we are indebted to “The Reliquary, Archæological\r\nJournal.”\r\n\r\nAnother brass plate, near the chancel-arch, bears the following\r\ninscription:—\r\n\r\n      “Here lies ye Body of Mr. Iohn Philips,\r\n      sometime Houskeeper at Chatsworth,\r\n      who departed this life on ye 28th of May,\r\n      1735, in ye 73rd year of his age, and 60th\r\n      of his Service in ye most Noble Family\r\n      of His Grace the Duke of\r\n      Devonshire.\r\n      Pray let my Bones together lie\r\n      Until that sad and joyfull Day,\r\n      When from above a Voice shall say,\r\n      Rise, all ye Dead, lift up your Eyes,\r\n      Your great Creator bids you rise;\r\n      Then do I hope with all ye Just\r\n      To shake off my polluted Dust,\r\n      And in new Robes of Glory Drest\r\n      To have access amongst ye Bless’d.\r\n  Which God of his infinite Mercy Grant,\r\n  For the sake & through ye Merits of my\r\n  Redeemer, Jesus Christ ye Righteous.\r\n\r\n                                        Amen.”\r\n\r\nIn the chapel alluded to is a large and remarkably fine monument,\r\nentirely filling up its west side, and of somewhat remarkable\r\ncharacter. On either side is a massive pedestal, supporting a life-size\r\nstatue, and pilasters which rise behind them support a pediment for the\r\nsculptured arms, crest, and supporters of the Earl of Devonshire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Monumental Brass to John Beton._\r\n\r\nDEO OPT MAX ET POSTERITATI SACRVM.\r\n\r\nIoanni Betonio Scoto, nobilis & optimi viri Ioannis Betonii ab\r\nAnthmwthy filio, Dauidis Betonii Illustriss.

Here, in a grassy\r\nenclosure at the top of the churchyard, too, lies the “good duke,”\r\nunder a plain and simple coped tomb, with a foliated cross, and this\r\nsimple inscription on its south side:—\r\n\r\n  “William Spencer Cavendish,\r\n  Sixth Duke of Devonshire.\r\n\r\n  Born May 21, 1790. Died January 18, 1858.”\r\n\r\nNear this, on a coped tomb, with a plain cross standing at the head,\r\nis the following inscription to the mother of the present Duke of\r\nDevonshire:—\r\n\r\n “In the Faith and Peace of Christ, Here Resteth all that was Mortal of\r\n Louisa Cavendish, Daughter of Cornelius, First Lord Lismore, widow of\r\n William Cavendish, Eldest Son of George Henry Augustus, First Earl of\r\n Burlington, and Mother of William, Seventh Duke of Devonshire. Born\r\n August 5th, 1779. Died April 17th, 1863.\r\n\r\n “‘As in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.’—1\r\n Cor. xv. 22.”\r\n\r\nAnd another is thus inscribed:—\r\n\r\n “Henry George Cavendish. Born May 24, 1836. Died November 9, 1865.”\r\n\r\nIn the churchyard is the heavy tomb of Sir Joseph Paxton, sometime head\r\ngardener at Chatsworth; it bears the following inscriptions:—\r\n\r\n “In memory of Sir Joseph Paxton, born at Milton Bryant, Bedfordshire,\r\n August IIIrd, MDCCCIII., died at Rockhills, Sydenham, June VIIIth,\r\n MDCCCLXV., aged LXI. years.\r\n\r\n “In memory of Laura, the lamented daughter of Sir Joseph and Lady\r\n Paxton, who departed this life, January VIIIth, MDCCCLV., aged XVI.\r\n years. ‘Her sun is gone down while it was yet day.’—Jer. xv. 9.\r\n\r\n “In Memory of William, Son of Sir Joseph and Lady Paxton, who departed\r\n this life Dec. XVIth, MDCCCXXXV., aged VII. years. ‘He shall gather\r\n the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom.’—Isaiah xl. 2.”\r\n\r\nAmong the other inscriptions, the following are particularly worth\r\nnoticing:—\r\n\r\n    “Of Stature Great,\r\n    Of Mind most Just,\r\n    Here lies Will Grumbold\r\n    In the Dust.\r\n  Who died 25 May, 1690.”\r\n\r\n “Here lieth ye body of James Brousard, who departed this life April\r\n the 10th, 1762, aged 76 yrs.\r\n\r\n Also Sarah, ye wife of James Brousard, who departed this life February\r\n ye 10th, 1765, aged 77 yrs.\r\n\r\n  Ful forty years as Gardener to ye D of Devenshire,\r\n  to propigate ye earth with plants it was is ful desire;\r\n  but then thy bones, alas, brave man, earth did no rest afoard,\r\n  but now wee hope ye are at rest with Jesus Christ our lord.”\r\n\r\n “Here lieth the Body of William Dunthin, who departed this life\r\n September the 12th, 1787, aged 21 years.\r\n\r\n “I was like grass, cut down in haste, for fear too long should grow. I\r\n hope made fit in heaven to sit, so why should I not go?”\r\n\r\nAnother, to William Mather, 1818, says:—\r\n\r\n  “When he that day with th’ Waggon went,\r\n  He little thought his Glass was spent;\r\n  But had he kept his Plough in Hand,\r\n  He might have longer till’d the Land.”\r\n\r\nThe CHATSWORTH HOTEL, at Edensor—the only one in the place—is\r\nsituate close outside the park gates, with an open space of ground in\r\nfront, and surrounded by the most magnificent of trees and the most\r\nbeautiful of scenery. It is fitted with every appliance for comfort;\r\nhas an excellent _cuisine_; is liberally and well conducted; has every\r\npossible convenience of stabling and coach-houses; and is, altogether,\r\none of the most desirable and comfortable of hotels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Chatsworth Hotel, Edensor._]\r\n\r\nFrom this house, which is an excellent centre for tourists, for\r\nenjoying the neighbourhood, and who have the magnificent park to stroll\r\nabout in at all hours, delightful excursions may be made to places in\r\nthe neighbourhood. Chatsworth is at hand; Haddon Hall is only some\r\nthree miles away for a walk, or six for a delightful drive, round by\r\nway of Bakewell; Monsall Dale, Cressbrook Dale, Middleton Dale, and a\r\nhost of other “dales” are all within a short distance; and, indeed, a\r\nradius of ten miles from the hotel takes in almost every well-known\r\nbeautiful or romantic spot of the district; while Buxton, with its\r\nmany attractions, and Dove-Dale, with all its beauties, are only a\r\nlittle beyond this distance. It is, indeed, a district to revel in,\r\nand the tourist who “pitches his tent” at the Chatsworth Hotel will be\r\nconveniently placed for access to all.\r\n\r\nWe have spoken of Edensor, which closely adjoins one of the entrances\r\nto Chatsworth Park. Near the other lodges are the picturesque villages\r\nof Baslow and Beeley, to which we must pay passing attention.\r\n\r\nBASLOW is a large and somewhat picturesque village; it lies on the\r\nhigh road from Bakewell to Chesterfield, Sheffield, &c., and the river\r\nDerwent runs through one part of it. The churchyard is skirted by the\r\nriver, and near it is a fine old bridge spanning the stream. The church\r\nis a singular, but very picturesque old building, with a low tower and\r\nbroad spire at its north-west corner, and it possesses many features\r\nworthy of careful examination. At Baslow are some very good inns, the\r\nprincipal of which are the “Peacock” and the “Wheatsheaf.”\r\n\r\nBEELEY, which the visitor will pass through on his way to Chatsworth\r\nfrom the Rowsley Station, is a pretty little village, with a\r\nquaint-looking old church, an elegant Gothic parsonage-house, and many\r\nvery pretty residences. Beeley Bridge, with the public lodge near it,\r\nwe have shown in one of our engravings, from a photograph by Green.\r\nOf other places in the neighbourhood, some of which we have already\r\ntouched upon in our account of Haddon Hall, space will not permit us to\r\ndescribe.\r\n\r\nWe take leave of “princely Chatsworth.” It is a place worthy of all\r\nthat can be said in its praise; and to its noble owner—one of the\r\nkindliest, most enlightened, and liberal men of the age—we tender, not\r\nonly our own, but public thanks for the generous manner in which he\r\nthrows its beauties and its treasures open to the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Agard, Family of, 324.\r\n\r\n  Alnwick Castle, 78 to 115;\r\n    History of, 82 to 96, 101 to 110;\r\n    Situation, 81;\r\n

SERIES_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE noble mansions which have been chosen to form the second series\r\nof our “Stately Homes of England” will, it gives us pleasure to know,\r\nbe found to fully bear out what was said in the Introduction to the\r\nfirst volume, that England is emphatically a Kingdom of Homes, and that\r\nthese and their associations, and the love which is felt for them, are\r\nits main source of happiness and true greatness. For assuredly those\r\nwe have now selected, like those already illustrated, are noble in\r\ntheir plans, their proportions, and their architecture; stately and\r\nmagnificent in their appointments and internal arrangements; stirring\r\nin the historical incidents with which they have been connected;\r\ninteresting from the grand old families by whom they have been, and\r\nare still, inhabited; and more than passingly interesting from their\r\nantiquarian character, their architectural features, their romantic\r\nbeauties, their picturesque surroundings, and the invaluable treasures\r\nof Art enshrined within their walls. No matter in what Shire they\r\nare situated—and we have selected them alike from east and west,\r\nfrom north and south, as well as from the “lovely midlands”—these\r\n“Homes” serve but as examples of innumerable others that, dotted over\r\nthe surface of the country, form the glory of England, and, through\r\ntheir noble owners, add to the stability, the greatness, and the proud\r\nsupremacy of\r\n\r\n  “Our own, our native land.”\r\n\r\nEngland has, indeed, reason to be proud of her Homes, and it has been\r\na pleasant and a loving task to describe and to illustrate some of\r\nthem in these volumes; to give records of the historical incidents with\r\nwhich they have been associated; and to add the ample genealogical\r\nnotices of the families to whom they belong.\r\n\r\nLike those in the first volume, these notices were prepared for,\r\nand originally appeared in, the _Art Journal_, but they have been\r\nrearranged, here and there rewritten, and in every case materially\r\nadded to. We shall hope to follow up the present volume—the second of\r\nthe series—with two or three more of a similar character, in which\r\nother houses, equally beautiful, equally interesting, and equally\r\n“stately” with those we have described, will form the theme of our pen\r\nand the subject of our pencil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS OF SECOND SERIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n

Stately among the stateliest, and\r\nstanding on an eminence in the midst of an undulating country, the one\r\nobject on which the eye rests from whichever side it is approached,\r\nthe castle commands uninterrupted views ranging over three separate\r\ncounties, and embracing within its ken such a variety of plain and\r\nwater, wood and valley, hill and meadow, as no other “Home” can boast.\r\nSituated nearly at the junction of the three counties of Leicester,\r\nNottingham, and Lincoln, the panoramic view obtained from the castle\r\ncombines the characteristics of each, and its extent ranges over an\r\narea of fifty or sixty miles in diameter—being on one side bounded by\r\nLincoln Minster (which is, in a clear atmosphere, distinctly visible)\r\nand the hills beyond, although thirty miles off “as the crow flies.”\r\nIts immediate neighbourhood, the lovely and fertile “vale of Belvoir,”\r\nthe theme of poet and prose-writer, and the delight of the painter and\r\nlover of nature, lies immediately below, while beyond are miles of\r\nlovely country, gloriously diversified with wood and water, and studded\r\nat intervals with hamlets, villages, and homesteads, which add greatly\r\nto the beauty of the scene.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Belvoir Castle from the Grantham Road._]\r\n\r\nA marked and peculiar character of Belvoir, and one of its greatest\r\ncharms, is that it stands in the midst of this open country, not within\r\nthe confines of its own park. There is no enclosed park; and park\r\npalings, lodges, bolts, bars, and locks are unknown. The Duke, in this\r\nnoble mansion, rests in the midst of his immense estates, and draws no\r\ncordon around him. The roads, right up to the very castle, are open and\r\nfree to all, and restriction is unknown. For miles in extent, and from\r\nevery side, the public may wander on foot, or ride or drive, through\r\nthe estate and up to the very doors, unmolested, and untrammelled by\r\nfear of porters, or deterred by appliances of state or ceremony. The\r\nstronghold of the De Todenis, the Albinis, the Especs, the De Ros’, and\r\nthe Manners’, thus nestles securely in the very heart of the country,\r\nas does its noble owner—the descendant and representative of this long\r\nline of illustrious men—in the hearts of his tenantry, his friends,\r\nand all who have the privilege of knowing him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Arms of De Todeni, De Albini, and De Ros._]\r\n\r\nThe history of Belvoir Castle dates back to very early times, and is\r\ninvested with more than ordinary interest. Leaving the question as to\r\nits site having originally been a Celtic stronghold taken possession\r\nof and formed into a station, or something of the kind, by the Romans,\r\nto be discussed elsewhere, it is sufficient for our present purpose to\r\nsay that at the Norman Conquest, Belvoir, with some fourscore manors,\r\nwas given by William the Conqueror to his faithful standard-bearer,\r\nRobert de Todeni, who here built a castle and founded a monastery.\r\nThis monastery, situated at the foot of the castle hill, and on whose\r\nsite many interesting remains have in late years been exhumed, was\r\nestablished in 1077, and was endowed with large estates; its founder,\r\nRobert Belvidir or De Todeni, agreeing to give to it for ever a tenth\r\npart of all the lands he might acquire by the help of God or the\r\ngrant of the King. This priory was established for four monks of the\r\nBenedictine Order (and afterwards became a cell of the Abbey of St.\r\nAlbans), who were to pray for the souls of the King, of the Earl of\r\nCornwall, of Robert de Todeni, and Adelais, his wife, and of their\r\nparents and children. Robert de Todeni died in 1088, and, with his\r\nwife, who predeceased him, was buried in the priory at Belvoir which he\r\nhad founded. He was succeeded by his son William, who took the surname\r\nof De Albini Brito, by whom the grants to the priory were confirmed and\r\nincreased, and he obtained for the monks a grant of a fair for eight\r\ndays in the year on the feast of St. John the Baptist. He married Maud\r\nde St. Liz, widow of Robert de Tonebrigg, daughter of Simon, Earl of\r\nNorthampton and Huntingdon, and, dying in 1155, he, too, was buried at\r\nBelvoir, and was succeeded by his son, William de Albini, or Meschines\r\n(also buried here), who in turn was succeeded by his son, the third\r\nWilliam de Albini, whose name, in connection with King John and Magna\r\nCharta, is matter of history. During his imprisonment at Corfe Castle\r\nby his unforgiving king, Belvoir Castle was, at the summons of the\r\nsovereign, surrendered into his hands. Under Henry III., Albini, being\r\nreinstated in favour, had a chief command at the battle of Lincoln,\r\nand took part in most of the stirring events of the period. Besides\r\nadding to the endowments of Belvoir Priory, he founded the Hospital of\r\nOur Lady at Newstead, for the health of the souls of himself and his\r\ntwo wives, and there his body was buried in 1236, while his heart was\r\nplaced under the wall opposite the high altar at Belvoir. He married\r\nAgatha Trusbut, for the privilege of marrying whom he gave the King 600\r\nmarks (about £6,000 of our money). He was succeeded by his son, the\r\nfourth William de Albini, or, as he was called, William de Belvoir,\r\nwho left no male issue, but, by his wife Albreda Biset, had an only\r\nchild, a daughter Isabel, who married Robert de Ros, Lord of Hamlake,\r\nfifth in regular descent from Peter de Ros, who, by marriage with\r\nAdeline, daughter of Walter Espec, became the inheritor of two princely\r\nfortunes. Thus by the marriage of Isabel de Albini with Robert de Ros\r\nthe estates of Espec, Ros, and Albini became united.\r\n\r\nThis Robert de Ros, after his accession to the Belvoir estates,\r\nobtained a grant of free warren and a weekly market there from Henry\r\nIII. Later on, as one of the insurgent barons, he was imprisoned and\r\nfined. In 1267 he raised a new embattled and fortified wall at Belvoir\r\nCastle. He died in 1285; his body being buried at Kirkham, his bowels\r\nbefore the high altar at Belvoir, and his heart at Croxton Abbey. At\r\nthe suppression of the monasteries part of the monument which had been\r\nplaced over his heart at Croxton was removed to Bottesford Church,\r\nwhere it still remains in the chancel wall. His widow, Isabel, died\r\nin 1301, and was buried at Newstead. He was succeeded by his son,\r\nWilliam de Ros, who became an unsuccessful competitor for the crown of\r\nScotland, founding his claim on his descent from his great-grandmother\r\nIsabel, daughter to William the Lion, King of Scotland. By his marriage\r\nwith Matilda de Vaux he added to the family estates and ecclesiastical\r\npatronage; and on his death, in 1317, was succeeded by his son, William\r\nde Ros, who was created Lord Ros of Werke; became Baron Ros of Hamlake,\r\nWerke, Belvoir, and Trusbut; was summoned to Parliament, second Edward\r\nII. to sixteenth Edward III.; was made Lord High Admiral, and one of\r\nthe Commissioners to treat for peace with Robert Bruce. He died in\r\n1342, and was succeeded by his son, William de Ros, who, after a busy\r\nmilitary life, fighting against the Scots, at the siege of Calais,\r\nand against the Saracens, died on his way to the Holy Land, and was\r\nburied abroad. He married Margaret, daughter of Ralph, Lord Nevill, who\r\nsurvived him, and afterwards married Sir Henry de Percy.\r\n\r\nDying without issue he was succeeded by his brother, Thomas de Ros;\r\nwho, having married, in 1359, Beatrice, daughter of the Earl of\r\nStrafford and widow of the Earl of Desmond, was in turn followed by\r\nhis son, John de Ros, who dying without issue, was succeeded by his\r\nbrother, Sir William de Ros. Sir William was, with Walter, Bishop of\r\nDurham, and the Earl of Northumberland, sent by King Henry IV. to\r\narrange a treaty of peace with Scotland. He was a favourite with the\r\nKing, who gave him many important offices; made him a K.G.; and granted\r\nhim the town of Chingford, in Essex. By his wife, Margaret, of the\r\nfamily of the Earl of Arundel, Sir William had issue five sons and four\r\ndaughters. He died at Belvoir Castle in 1414, and was buried in the\r\nchoir of that priory, his monument being now at Bottesford. The next\r\nin succession was John de Ros, son of the last named, who came to the\r\ntitle and estates when only seventeen years of age. He was killed along\r\nwith the Duke of Clarence and others in 1421; and, dying without issue,\r\nhad for successor his brother, Sir Thomas de Ros, who married Eleanor,\r\ndaughter of Richard de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, by whom he had issue\r\nthree sons, of whom his successor, Thomas, Lord Ros, was the eldest,\r\nand who, at his father’s death in 1431, was only four years of age.\r\n\r\nThis nobleman, Thomas, Baron Ros of Hamlake, Trusbut, and Belvoir, was\r\nby the King put into full possession of his father’s estates when only\r\neighteen years of age. He married Philippa, eldest daughter of John\r\nde Tiptoft, by whom he had issue one son and four daughters. For his\r\nfidelity to the House of Lancaster in the Wars of the Roses, he was,\r\nwith his adherents, attainted in Parliament in 1461, and is said by\r\nRapin to have been beheaded. His estates were confiscated, and given\r\nto various adherents of the House of York; Lord Hastings receiving\r\nBelvoir and its members. By him Belvoir Castle was utterly despoiled,\r\nhe carrying away the lead from the roofs to Ashby-de-la-Zouch, to use\r\nin his own castle there, and rendering the place no better than a ruin.\r\n\r\nThe next in succession, Edmund, Lord Ros, was by Henry VII. (who had\r\nunited the rival houses) restored to his father’s state and dignity;\r\nthe attainder was removed; and the Belvoir and other estates returned\r\nto him. He died in 1508, at his house of Elsinges, at Enfield (in the\r\nchurch at which, place is a noble monument erected to his memory),\r\nwithout issue, and his estates were divided between his sisters and\r\nco-heiresses—viz. Eleanor, married to Sir Robert Manners, Knight;\r\nand Isabel, married to Sir Thomas Lovel. Belvoir, with Hamlake in\r\nYorkshire, and Orston in Nottinghamshire, being the portion of the\r\nelder sister, Eleanor, thus passed into the hands of the family of\r\nManners, in whom it has remained in unbroken succession to the present\r\nhour. The manor of Elsinges, which had passed to Sir Thomas Lovel,\r\nas part of his wife’s portion, was bequeathed by him to the Earl of\r\nRutland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Ancient Arms of Manners._]\r\n\r\nThis Sir Robert Manners, who, as we have said, acquired Belvoir through\r\nhis marriage with one of the co-heiresses of the last Lord de Ros, was\r\ndescended from a long line of Manners’ of Northumberland. The earliest\r\nof these of whom there is direct evidence was Sir Robert Manners, lord\r\nof the manor of Ethale, in Northumberland, from whom descended another\r\nSir Robert, who married Philippa, daughter of Sir Bartholomew de Mont\r\nBouchier, by whom he had issue a son, also named Robert, who married\r\nHawise, daughter of Robert, Baron de Muschamp, in the reign of Henry\r\nI. Their great-grandson, another Sir Robert Manners, married Agnes,\r\ndaughter of Sir David Coupland. Their son, Sir Robert, had issue by his\r\nwife, Joan de Heton, four sons, three of whom dying without issue, the\r\nsecond son, William Manners, inherited the estates. He married Ellen,\r\nor Janetta, daughter of David Bagster, of Derby, by whom he had a son,\r\nSir Robert Manners.\r\n\r\nThis Sir Robert was returned, in the seventeenth year of Edward III.,\r\nas one of the principal persons in the county of Northumberland, and\r\nwas entitled to bear arms by descent. In the first year of Edward’s\r\nreign, being governor of Norham Castle, he distinguished himself by\r\nhis successful defence of that stronghold against the Scots, who,\r\n“despising King Edward’s youth, on the very night of that day on\r\nwhich King Edward was crowned, intended to take Norham Castle by\r\nsurprise; and so well managed their design that about sixteen of them\r\nhad already mounted the walls. But the captain, Sir Robert Manners,\r\nbeing warned of the matter beforehand by one of his garrison, who\r\nwas a Scotsman, had so well prepared to receive them, that of those\r\nwho had mounted he took five or six, and put the rest to the sword,\r\ntheir companions below, upon this disappointment, retiring.” In the\r\nnext year he was constituted one of the “conservators of the truce\r\nmade with the Scots for all hostilities to cease.” Soon afterwards\r\nhe was made sheriff of the county of Selkirk, and appointed to keep\r\nand defend the forts of Selkirk and Ettrick, &c. In the fourteenth of\r\nthe same reign he represented Northumberland in Parliament, and again\r\nsubdued Scotch incursions. Soon afterwards he obtained a license from\r\nthe King “to strengthen and embattle his dwelling-house at Ethale,\r\nin Northumberland, with a wall made of stone and lime, and to hold\r\nthe same to himself and his heirs for ever.” The next year he was\r\nconstituted one of the commissioners to treat with David Bruce and his\r\nadherents for a peace, and subsequently was made Lord of the Marches.\r\nAt the battle of Neville’s Cross in 1346, under Queen Philippa, in\r\nwhich the Scottish king was taken prisoner, Sir Robert displayed great\r\nvalour, and was intrusted to keep charge of the prisoners, and deliver\r\nthem to the Constable at the Tower of London. He died in 1355, leaving\r\nhis son and heir, John de Manners (by his wife, Aliva, or Alice,\r\ndaughter of Henry Strather), only one year and three weeks old.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Belvoir Castle from the North-west, showing the Grand\r\nEntrance._]\r\n\r\nThis John Manners received the honour of knighthood, and married Alice,\r\nwidow of William de Whitchester; and, dying in 1402, was succeeded by\r\nhis son, Sir John Manners, who was sheriff of Northumberland, and, with\r\nhis son John, was accused of the murder of William Heron and Robert\r\nAtkinson, or Akyman. They were prosecuted by Sir Robert de Umphreville,\r\nand Isabel, widow of William Heron, and were ordered to “cause 500\r\nmasses to be sung for the health of the soul of the same William\r\nHeron within one year then next ensuing, and pay unto Sir Robert de\r\nUmphreville, and Isabel, to the use of the said Isabel and her children\r\nby Heron, 200 marks.” He was succeeded by his son Robert, who married\r\nJoan, daughter of Sir Robert Ogle, and had issue by her, with others, a\r\nson, Robert, by whom he was succeeded. This was the Sir Robert Manners\r\nwho married Eleanor, daughter of Thomas, Lord Ros, as already shown.\r\nSir Robert Manners had issue by his wife, Eleanor Ros, three daughters,\r\nwho each married into the family of Fairfax, and two sons. The elder\r\nof these sons was Sir George Manners, who, on the death of his mother,\r\nbecame Lord Ros or Roos, and was also lineal heir to the baronies of\r\nVaux, Trusbut, and Belvoir.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Augmented Arms of Manners._]\r\n\r\nMARRYING Anne, only daughter and heiress of Sir Thomas St. Leger,\r\nby his wife Anne, daughter of Richard, Duke of York, and sister to\r\nKing Edward IV., and widow of John Holland, Duke of Exeter, this lady\r\nbrought royal blood into the family. By her Sir George had a numerous\r\nfamily, the eldest of whom, Thomas, succeeded him.\r\n\r\nThis Sir Thomas Manners, on the death of his father, became thirteenth\r\nLord Ros, of Hamlake, and Baron Trusbut, Riveaulx, and Belvoir. He was\r\nwith Henry VIII. and his queen at the celebrated interview between that\r\nmonarch and the King of France at Guisnes, and in the same reign was\r\nmade Warden of the East Marches, and had many other honours granted\r\nhim. In the seventeenth year of the same monarch he was created Earl\r\nof Rutland—“a title which none but royal family had ever borne, and\r\nby reason of his descent from the sister of King Edward IV. had an\r\naugmentation to his ancient arms.” The old arms were—_or_ two bars\r\n_azure_, and a chief _gules_; which chief was augmented thus quarterly\r\n_azure_ and _gules_, in the first and fourth two fleurs-de-lis and in\r\nthe second and third a lion passant guardant, all _or_. He was also\r\ninstalled a Knight of the Garter. A few years later this nobleman\r\nwas present at the second interview between Henry VIII. and Francis\r\nI.; he was also present at the marriage of his sovereign with the\r\nill-fated Anne Boleyn; and, later on, attended Anne of Cleves to\r\nEngland, and was made her chamberlain. He was made Chief Justice in\r\nEyre of all the King’s lands north of the Trent, and obtained grants\r\nof the manors of Muston, Waltham, Croxton, Upwell, Bilsdale, Helmsley,\r\nOutwell, Elm, Emneth, Branston, &c., and lands belonging to several\r\ndissolved monasteries. He rebuilt Belvoir Castle, and removed many of\r\nthe monuments from the dissolved priories of Croxton and Belvoir to\r\nBottesford, where he himself was buried in 1543. His lordship—who took\r\npart in most of the events of this stirring reign, and held numerous\r\nimportant offices—married twice: first, Elizabeth, daughter of Sir\r\nRobert Lovel; and second, Eleanor, daughter of Sir William Paston, by\r\nthe latter of whom only he had issue. To the eldest and second of that\r\nissue we now refer.\r\n\r\nThe eldest son, Henry Manners, succeeded his father, in 1543, as second\r\nEarl of Rutland. He continued the rebuilding of Belvoir Castle, and was\r\nmade Constable of Nottingham Castle, Chief Justice in Eyre of Sherwood\r\nForest, &c. He was married twice: first, to Margaret, daughter of the\r\nfourth Earl of Westmoreland, by whom he had issue; and second, to\r\nBridget, daughter of Lord Hussey, by whom he had no children. He was\r\nsucceeded by his eldest son, Edward Manners, as third Earl of Rutland,\r\nwho, dying without male issue, was succeeded by his brother, John\r\nManners (the second son of the second earl), as fourth Earl of Rutland.\r\nThis nobleman married Elizabeth, daughter of Francis Charlton, of\r\nApsley, by whom he had issue, with others, three sons—Roger Manners,\r\nSir Francis Manners, and Sir George Manners—who successively became\r\nfifth, sixth, and seventh Earls of Rutland. All these dying without\r\nsurviving male issue, the title passed to the descendants of the second\r\nson of the first Earl, as we shall now show.\r\n\r\nSir John Manners, second son of the first Earl of Rutland, and\r\ngreat-grandson of the sister of King Edward IV., became, before he\r\nwas knighted, attached to Dorothy Vernon, the youngest daughter and\r\nco-heiress of Sir George Vernon of Haddon Hall, known as “the King of\r\nthe Peak,” and so effectually wooed and won her, that he at length\r\ncarried her off on horseback into his own county of Leicester, and\r\nthere married her. By this marriage Haddon Hall, and the Derbyshire\r\nproperty of the “King of the Peak,” passed into the family of Manners.\r\nSir John Manners had issue by his wife, Dorothy Vernon, three sons—Sir\r\nGeorge, who succeeded him; John, who died at the age of fourteen;\r\nand Sir Roger, of Whitwell; and one daughter, Grace, who married Sir\r\nFrancis Fortescue, of Salden. Sir George Manners, their son, married\r\nGrace, daughter of Sir Henry Pierrepoint, and sister to the Earl\r\nof Kingston, by whom he had issue, with others, John Manners, his\r\neldest son, who not only succeeded him, but also succeeded his cousin\r\nGeorge, seventh Earl of Rutland, in his title and estates, and thus\r\nbecame eighth Earl of Rutland. He married Frances, daughter of Edward,\r\nLord Montague of Boughton, by whom he had issue four sons and seven\r\ndaughters. He was sheriff of Derbyshire in the ninth and eleventh years\r\nof Charles I., and also represented that county in Parliament. His\r\nlordship was attached to the Parliamentary interest during the civil\r\nwars, and was one of the twenty-two peers who remained at Westminster\r\nwhen the King summoned both Houses to attend him at Oxford. As a\r\nconsequence, his castle of Belvoir was seized by the Royalists, and\r\nwas held by them and Sir Gervase Lucas, and here the King frequently\r\nresided. It was finally surrendered to the Parliamentarians in January,\r\n1645-6. In 1649 the castle was demolished, by consent of the Earl, who\r\nsoon afterwards set about rebuilding it, which he completed in 1668.\r\nDuring this time the Earl lived principally at Haddon Hall, where he\r\ndied in 1679, and was succeeded by his third and only surviving son,\r\nJohn Manners, as ninth Earl of Rutland.\r\n\r\nThis nobleman was born in 1638, and, in 1679 was created a peer in his\r\nown right by the title of Baron Manners of Haddon; and in September of\r\nthe same year, his father dying, he became Earl of Rutland. When twenty\r\nyears of age he had married the Lady Anne Pierrepoint, daughter of the\r\nMarquis of Dorchester, from whom he was afterwards divorced; and he\r\nmarried, secondly, Lady Diana Bruce, widow of Sir Seymour Shirley, and\r\ndaughter of the Earl of Aylesbury, who died in child-bed. His lordship\r\nmarried, thirdly, Catherine, daughter of Baptist Noel, Viscount Camden,\r\nby whom only he had surviving issue. In 1703 the Earl was raised to the\r\nhighest dignity in the realm, by the titles of Marquis of Granby and\r\nDuke of Rutland. He died in January, 1710-11, aged seventy-three, and\r\nwas succeeded by his only surviving son, John Manners.\r\n\r\nJohn, second Duke of Rutland, when scarcely seventeen years of age,\r\nwas married to Katherine, second daughter of Lord William Russell,\r\nwho was beheaded in 1683. He then bore the title of Lord Roos; and\r\nthe wedding festivities seem, judging from some curious letters still\r\nextant concerning them, to have been of the most lavishly extravagant\r\ncharacter. This lady, who was sister to the Duchess of Devonshire and\r\nto the Duke of Bedford, gave birth to five sons and four daughters, and\r\ndied in child-bed in 1711. The Duke married, secondly, Lucy, daughter\r\nof Lord Sherard, and sister of the Earl of Harborough, by whom also he\r\nhad issue six sons and two daughters. His grace died in 1721, and was\r\nsucceeded, as third Duke of Rutland, by his eldest son, John Manners.\r\nThis nobleman, who was born in 1696, married, in 1717, Bridget, only\r\ndaughter and heiress of Robert Sutton, Lord Lexington (an alliance that\r\ngave him a large accession of estates), by whom he had issue thirteen\r\nchildren, nearly all of whom died young. He it was who built the\r\nhunting-seat at Croxton, and made many improvements at Belvoir Castle.\r\nHe was the last of the family who made Haddon Hall a residence. The\r\nestates of Lord Lexington having been settled upon the younger branch\r\nof the family, the second and surviving sons, successively, took, by\r\nAct of Parliament, the additional surname of Sutton, and thus founded\r\nthe family of Manners-Sutton.\r\n\r\nThe Duke, who was familiarly known as “Old John of the Hill,” dying\r\nin 1779, was succeeded by his grandson, Charles Manners, son of the\r\ncelebrated Marquis of Granby, Commander-in-chief of the British forces\r\nin Germany, and Master of the Ordnance, who died during his father’s\r\nlifetime. Charles, fourth Duke of Rutland, married Mary Isabella,\r\ndaughter of Charles Noel, Duke of Beaufort, by whom he had issue four\r\nsons—viz. Lord John Henry (who succeeded him), Lord Charles Henry\r\nSomerset, Lord Robert William, and Lord William Robert Albini; and two\r\ndaughters—viz. the Lady Elizabeth Isabella, married to Richard Norman,\r\nEsq., and Lady Catherine Mary, married to Lord Forester. His Grace died\r\nwhile holding office as Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, and was succeeded\r\nby his eldest son—\r\n\r\nJohn Henry Manners, as fifth Duke of Rutland, who married Elizabeth,\r\ndaughter of the Earl of Carlisle, and by her had issue six sons and\r\nfive daughters. The sons were—Lord George Henry Manners, to whom King\r\nGeorge III. stood sponsor in person, but who died in infancy; Lord\r\nGeorge John Frederick Manners, to whom the Prince Regent and H.R.H. the\r\nDuke of York stood sponsors in person, but who also died in infancy;\r\nLord Charles Cecil John Manners (the present Duke of Rutland); Lord\r\nAdolphus Edward Manners, who died in infancy: Lord John James Robert\r\nManners, M.P., the present eminent statesman and man of letters; and\r\nLord George John Manners, M.P., who married in 1855 the Lady Adeliza\r\nMatilda Howard, daughter of the thirteenth Duke of Norfolk, and died in\r\n1875. The five daughters were—the Lady Caroline Isabella Manners, who\r\ndied in infancy; the Lady Elizabeth Frederica Manners, now the widow\r\nof Andrew Robert Drummond, Esq.; the Lady Emmeline Charlotte Elizabeth\r\nManners (deceased), married to the Hon. Charles Stuart Wortley; the\r\nLady Katherine Isabella Manners (deceased), married to Earl Jermyn;\r\nand the Lady Adeliza Gertrude Elizabeth Manners, married to the Rev.\r\nFrederick John Norman, Rector of Bottesford.\r\n\r\nThe present noble head of the House of Manners is, as we have just\r\nstated, his Grace Charles Cecil John Manners, the sixth Duke of\r\nRutland, Marquis of Granby, fourteenth Earl of Rutland, Baron Manners\r\nof Haddon, Baron Ros of Hamlake, Baron Trusbut, Riveaulx, and Belvoir,\r\nK.G., &c., the “King of Belvoir,” as he may not inaptly be called, for\r\nhis is a regal residence, and he reigns in the hearts of the people\r\naround him. He is, therefore, the direct descendant and representative\r\nin unbroken succession of the grand old standard-bearer of William\r\nthe Conqueror, Robert de Todeni, and of the families of De Albini,\r\nEspec, De Ros, and Manners; and by equally direct descent he has\r\nroyal blood coursing through his veins. His grace was born in 1815,\r\nand was educated at Eton and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where\r\nhe took his M.A. degree in 1835; was M.P. for Stamford from 1837 to\r\n1852, and from that time to his accession to the titles in 1867, for\r\nNorth Leicestershire; and he was a Lord of the Bed-chamber to the late\r\nPrince Consort. His grace is not married, the heir to his titles,\r\nestates, and revenues being his brother, Lord John Manners, who is a\r\nworthy representative of the long and illustrious line from which he\r\nhas sprung. The Duke is patron of twenty-four livings, of which one\r\nis in Rutland, fifteen in Leicestershire, two in Lincolnshire, two in\r\nCambridgeshire, two in Nottinghamshire, and two in Derbyshire. His\r\nseats are—Belvoir Castle, in Leicestershire; Haddon Hall and Longshawe\r\nLodge, in Derbyshire; and Cheveley Park, in Cambridgeshire.\r\n\r\nLord John Manners was born in 1818, and in 1851 married Louisa\r\nCatherine, daughter of Colonel Marlay, by whom he had issue one son\r\n(the present Henry John Brinsley Manners), and another who died in\r\ninfancy. This lady, dying in 1854, was buried at Rowsley, where\r\na magnificent monument—one of the happiest efforts of W. Calder\r\nMarshall—has been erected to her memory. His lordship married\r\nsecondly, in 1862, Janetta, eldest daughter of Thomas Hughan, Esq., by\r\nwhom he has issue several children. Lord John Manners has held many\r\nimportant offices. He was sworn a Privy Councillor, and appointed First\r\nCommissioner of Works and Buildings, which office he held many years,\r\nand in 1874 was appointed Postmaster-General.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Arms of Duke of Rutland._]\r\n\r\nThe arms of the Duke of Rutland are—_or_, two bars, _azure_; augmented\r\nby a chief, quarterly, first and fourth _azure_, two fleurs-de-lis,\r\n_or_ (France), second and third _gules_, a lion passant guardant, _or_\r\n(England). Crest, on a chapeau, _gules_, turned up, _ermine_, a peacock\r\nin pride, _proper_. Supporters, two unicorns, _argent_, horns, manes,\r\ntufts, and hoofs, _or_. Motto, “Pour y parvenir.” The ancient arms of\r\nManners, before the augmentation, were, _or_, two bars, _azure_, and a\r\nchief, _gules_.\r\n\r\nBelvoir Castle, as it now stands, is an erection of the present\r\ncentury, built upon Norman foundations. As we have already stated, the\r\nfirst castle was built by Robert de Todeni, standard-bearer to William\r\nthe Conqueror, and considerably extended by his successors. In 1461,\r\nor thereabouts, it was despoiled (on the attainder of its noble owner)\r\nby the Lord Hastings, to whom it had been granted by the King. “The\r\ntimber of the roof, being” by him “despoiled of the lead with which it\r\nwas covered, rotted away; and the soil between the walls at the last\r\ngrew full of elders, in which state the castle remained till it was\r\npartially rebuilt by the first Earl of Rutland, and completed by the\r\nsecond.” On the dissolution of the monasteries, many of the monuments\r\nof the Albini and Ros families were, by order of the first Earl, and\r\nlater, by his successor, removed from Belvoir Priory to Bottesford\r\nChurch, and others were also brought to the same place from Croxton\r\nAbbey. He commenced the rebuilding of the castle, which was completed\r\nby his son in 1555, “making it a nobler structure than it was before.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Belvoir Castle from the North-west._]\r\n\r\nIn 1619 the singular trial of an old woman, named Joan Flower, of\r\nBelvoir, and her two daughters, Margaret and Philippa, for sorcery, and\r\ncausing the deaths of the two sons of the Earl of Rutland, took place,\r\nand resulted in the execution of the two younger “witches,” the old\r\n“monstrous malicious woman,” or “devil incarnate,” as she was styled,\r\nhaving died as she was being taken to gaol; and the destruction of her\r\ncat, “Rutterkin.” The two sons, whose deaths were laid to the charge\r\nof these miserable victims of superstition, were Henry, Lord Ros, and\r\nFrancis Manners, his brother, sons of Francis, sixth Earl of Rutland,\r\nby his second wife, Cecilia, daughter of Sir John Tufton, and widow\r\nof Sir Henry Hungerford. That Joan Flower, aided by her profligate\r\ndaughters, did cause the deaths of the two children, and attempt\r\nthe lives of the Earl and Countess, probably by poison, seems most\r\nprobable, and they were justly punished. The following account of this\r\nsingular transaction, printed in 1619, describes—\r\n\r\n “Joan Flower as a monstrous woman, full of oaths, curses, and\r\n imprecations; and for any thing they saw by her, a plain atheist.\r\n Besides, of late days, her very countenance was estranged, her eyes\r\n very fiery and hollow, her speech fell and envious, her demeanour\r\n strange and exotic, and her conversation sequestered; so that the\r\n whole course of her life gave great suspicion that she was a\r\n notorious witch; yea, some of her neighbours dared to affirm that\r\n she dealt with familiar spirits, and terrified them all with curses\r\n and threatening of revenge, if there were never so little cause of\r\n displeasure and unkindness. Concerning Margaret, the daughter, that\r\n she often resorted from the castle to her mother, bringing such\r\n provision as they thought was unbefitting for a servant to purloin;\r\n and coming at such unseasonable hours that they could not but\r\n conjecture some mischief between them, and that their extraordinary\r\n riot and expenses tended both to rob the lady and to maintain certain\r\n deboist and base company, which frequented this Joan Flower’s house,\r\n the mother, and especially the youngest daughter. Concerning Philippa,\r\n that she was leudly transported with the love of one Thomas Simpson,\r\n who presumed to say that she had bewitched him, for he had no power\r\n to leave her, and was, as he supposed, marvellously altered both in\r\n mind and body, since her acquainted company. These complaints began\r\n many years before either their conviction or public apprehension.\r\n Notwithstanding, such was the honour of this earl and his lady; such\r\n was the cunning of this monstrous woman, in observation towards them;\r\n such was the subtlety of the devil, to bring his purposes to pass;\r\n such was the pleasure of God, to make trial of his servants; and such\r\n was the effect of a damnable woman’s wit and malicious envy, that\r\n all things were carried away in the smooth channel of liking and\r\n good entertainment, on every side, until the earl refused to give\r\n that credence to her, on some complaint preferred, which he had been\r\n accustomed to give; and the countess discovering in the daughter\r\n Margaret some indecencies of her life, and neglect of her business,\r\n discharged her from lying any more in the castle; dismissing her with\r\n handsome presents, but commanding her to go home. This inflamed the\r\n mother with hatred and rancour towards the earl, and his family.\r\n\r\n “When the devil perceived the inficious disposition of this wretch,\r\n and that she, and her daughters, might easily be made instruments\r\n to enlarge his kingdom; and be, as it were, the executioners of his\r\n vengeance, not caring whether it lighted upon innocents, or no; he\r\n came more near unto them, and in plain terms, to come quickly to the\r\n purpose, offered them his service, and that in such a manner, as they\r\n might easily command what they pleased; for he would attend you in\r\n such pretty forms of dog, cat, or rat, that they should neither be\r\n terrified, nor any body else suspicious of the matter. Upon this, they\r\n agree, and (as it should seem) give away their souls to the service of\r\n such spirits, as he had promised them; which filthy conditions were\r\n ratified with abominable kisses, and an odious sacrifice of blood,\r\n not leaving out certain charms and conjurations, with which the devil\r\n deceived them, as though nothing could be done without ceremony,\r\n and a solemnity of orderly ratification. By this time doth sathan\r\n triumph, and goeth away satisfied to have caught such fish in the net\r\n of his illusions: by this time, are these women devils incarnate, and\r\n grow proud again in their cunning and artificial power, to do what\r\n mischief they listed. By this time, they have learnt the manner of\r\n incantations, spells, and charms. By this time, they kill what cattle\r\n they list; and under the cover of flattery and familiar entertainment,\r\n keep hidden the stinging serpent of malice, and a venomous inclination\r\n to mischief. By this time, is the earl and his family threatened,\r\n and must feel the burthen of a terrible tempest, which, by these\r\n women’s devilish devices, fell upon him; he neither suspecting nor\r\n understanding the same. By this time, both himself and his honourable\r\n countess, are many times subject to sickness and extraordinary\r\n convulsions; which they, taking as gentle corrections from the hand of\r\n God, submit with quietness to his mercy, and study nothing more than\r\n to glorify their Creator in heaven, and bear his crosses on earth.\r\n\r\n “At last, as malice increased in these damnable women, so his family\r\n felt the smart of their revenge and inficious disposition; for his\r\n eldest son, Henry, Lord Rosse, sickened very strangely, and after\r\n awhile, died. His next, named Francis, Lord Rosse accordingly, was\r\n severely tormented by them, and most barbarously, and inhumanly\r\n tortured by a strange sickness. Not long after, the Lady Catherine was\r\n set upon by their dangerous and devilish practices; and many times\r\n in great danger of life, through extreme maladies and unusual fits,\r\n nay, (as it should seem, and they afterwards confessed) both the earl\r\n and his countess were brought into their snares, as they imagined,\r\n and indeed determined to keep them from having any more children. Oh\r\n unheard of wickedness and mischievous damnation! Notwithstanding all\r\n this, did the noble earl attend his majesty, both at Newmarket, before\r\n Christmas; and at Christmas, at Whitehall; bearing the loss of his\r\n children most nobly; and little suspecting that they had miscarried\r\n by witchcraft, or such like inventions of the devil; until it pleased\r\n God to discover the villanous practices of these women, and to command\r\n the devil from executing any further vengeance on innocents, but leave\r\n them to their shames, and the hands of justice, that they might not\r\n only be confounded for their villanous practices, but remain as a\r\n notorious example to all ages, of his judgment and fury. Thus were\r\n they apprehended, about Christmas, and carried to Lincoln gaol; after\r\n due examination, before sufficient justices of the peace, and discreet\r\n magistrates, who wondered at their audacious wickedness. But Joan\r\n Flower, the mother, before her conviction, (as they say,) called for\r\n bread and butter, and wished it might never go through her, if she\r\n were guilty of that whereupon she was examined; so, mumbling it in her\r\n mouth, never spake more words after; but fell down and died, as she\r\n was carried to Lincoln gaol, with a horrible excruciation of soul and\r\n body, and was buried at Ancaster.\r\n\r\n “When the earl heard of their apprehension, he hasted down with\r\n his brother, Sir George, and sometimes examined them himself, and\r\n sometimes sending them to others; at last, left them to the trial\r\n of law, before the judges of assize at Lincoln; and so they were\r\n convicted of murder, and executed accordingly, about the eleventh of\r\n March, to the terror of all beholders as example of such dissolute and\r\n abominable creatures.”\r\n\r\nOn the stately monument of the Earl at Bottesford the death of these\r\ntwo sons is thus alluded to:—“In 1608 he married the Lady Cecelia\r\nHungerf’rd, daughter to the Hon’ble Knight, Sir John Tufton, by whom he\r\nhad two sonnes, both which dyed in their infancy, by wicked practice\r\nand sorcerye.”\r\n\r\nIn the civil wars Belvoir Castle was taken by the Royalist party\r\nin 1642, and placed under command of Colonel Lucas. In 1645 the\r\nKing himself was there. In the same year Prince Rupert and Prince\r\nMaurice were at Belvoir. Soon afterwards it was besieged by the\r\nParliamentarians; the outworks and stables, which had been fortified,\r\nwere taken by storm; the entire village of Belvoir was demolished; and\r\non the 3rd of February, 1646, the castle, with its appurtenances, was,\r\nin pursuance of terms of capitulation, surrendered to the Parliament,\r\nwho immediately appointed Captain Markham as its governor. Shortly\r\nafterwards the castle was disgarrisoned and restored to its owner,\r\nthe Earl of Rutland. In 1649 the Council of State reported “their\r\nresolution for demolishing the castle; which the Earl of Rutland was\r\ncontent with,” and it was accordingly demolished, the Earl receiving a\r\nmiserable pittance by way of compensation, and taking up his residence\r\nat Haddon Hall. About 1662 the Earl appears to have commenced the\r\nrebuilding of the castle, which was completed in 1668. In 1801 the\r\nthen Duke of Rutland, father of the present duke, who had, during his\r\nminority, conceived the idea of rebuilding and extending the castle,\r\nbegan to carry out his design by pulling down the south and west fronts\r\nnext to the court-yard, and continued rebuilding under Wyatt till 1816,\r\nby which time the south-west and south-east parts were completed, and\r\nthe Grand Staircase and Picture Gallery in the north-west front were\r\nnearly finished. In that year a fire broke out in the castle, by which\r\nthe north-east and north-west fronts were entirely destroyed. By that\r\nfire a large number of valuable paintings, estimated at nearly eleven\r\nthousand pounds in value, were totally destroyed. Among these were no\r\nless than nineteen by Sir Joshua Reynolds (including the “Nativity”\r\nand a number of family portraits); and many by Rubens, Vandyke, Carlo\r\nMaratti, Lely, Domenichino, Rembrandt, Velasquez, Titian, Poussin,\r\nWest, and others. Fortunately, although five children of the Duke and\r\nDuchess (who themselves were at Cheveley), and all the household were\r\nsleeping in the castle, no loss of life occurred. In March, 1817, the\r\nDuke commenced rebuilding the castle, the architect being the Rev. Sir\r\nJohn Thoroton, of Bottesford, to whose good taste and that of the Duke\r\nand his amiable duchess, are due the fine proportions and the majestic\r\ncharacter of the building as it now stands.\r\n\r\nBelvoir has often been visited by royalty. James I. and Charles I.\r\nboth stayed there, and in 1813, the Prince Regent, afterwards George\r\nIV., and the Duke of York, spent several days there. In 1839 the\r\nDowager Queen Adelaide remained there for nearly a week, and in 1843\r\nour present beloved Queen Victoria, with the Prince Consort, the Queen\r\nDowager, the Duke of Wellington, and others, visited the Duke, and\r\nremained his guests for four days. In 1866 their Royal Highnesses the\r\nPrince and Princess of Wales visited Belvoir, and the Prince again\r\nremained there in 1873. Other members of the royal family have also\r\nbeen received within its walls.\r\n\r\nThe principal apartments of the castle are, by kind permission of the\r\nDuke, shown to visitors, and the surrounding grounds are literally, as\r\nwe have before said, open to all, “without let or hindrance.”\r\n\r\nPassing up the steep ascent from near the cosy inn (on, or closely\r\nadjoining to, the site of the old priory), the visitor, if on foot,\r\nwends his way along the path among magnificent forest trees, and up\r\na flight of stone steps to the basement story of the castle, where,\r\nin the solid masonry from which the superstructure rises, are the\r\nworkshops of the artisan retainers of the family; and from hence by a\r\nrising pathway to the bastion, mounted with cannon, which gives an air\r\nof baronial importance to the place. If the visitor ride or drive, the\r\nascent is somewhat more circuitous, but the carriage-way leads to the\r\nsame point—the Grand Entrance to the Castle.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Entrance, which is shown to the spectator’s left in our\r\ngeneral views from the north-west, opens from an advanced groined\r\nporch, into which carriages drive from one side, and out at the other,\r\nmassive doors enclosing them while visitors alight. Over the doors are\r\narmorial bearings of the family and its alliances. From the porch the\r\nentrance doorway opens into the groined entrance passage, or corridor,\r\ndecorated with stands of arms, banners (among which is the one borne by\r\nthe present Duke of Rutland at the funeral of the Duke of Wellington),\r\nand military trophies, which leads to the Guard-room, or Great Hall\r\nof the mansion. This noble room, which has a groined ceiling, and a\r\nmosaic floor of black and white marble and Nottinghamshire freestone,\r\nbears in recesses and arcades on its walls groups of arms and armour,\r\ntrophies of war, and other appropriate decorations; and in two glazed\r\nrecesses a number of relics of the great Marquis of Granby, and of\r\nhis brilliant military achievements, and his well-earned decorations.\r\nBesides many other objects of peculiar interest in this room are two\r\ntables made from remarkable deposits, of eleven years’ formation, in\r\nthe wooden water-pipes of the Blithe Mine in Derbyshire; a model of the\r\nold castle; standards, arms, and armour from the field of Waterloo; a\r\nChinese junk; and some good armour.\r\n\r\nOpposite the entrance are the Grand Staircase and the Guard-room\r\nGallery. In the windows of the latter are finely executed stained-glass\r\nfigures (by Wyatt) of Robert de Todeni, William de Albini, Walter\r\nEspec, and Robert de Ros, with their armorial insignia. From the\r\nlanding at the head of the Guard-room Staircase, which contains\r\nfull-length portraits of Queen Anne and George Prince of Denmark,\r\naccess is gained to the Grand Staircase leading to the principal\r\napartments; the walls of the staircase itself being hung with\r\nfull-length paintings of the first eight Earls of Rutland, with their\r\narmorial bearings within the archways. The ceiling is richly groined.\r\n\r\nThe Regent’s Gallery, so called from the Prince Regent (George IV.),\r\nfor whose use it was fitted up on his visit to Belvoir in 1813, is one\r\nof the main features of the castle. It is a noble apartment, 128 feet\r\nlong by 18 feet wide, with a central bow, formed by the central tower,\r\nof 36 feet wide. At one end is Nollekens’ fine bust of George IV., and\r\nat the other the equally fine bust of the late estimable duke, while\r\nother parts of the room are adorned with corresponding sculptures\r\nof the late Duchess of Rutland, the Marquis of Granby, Lord Robert\r\nManners, Pitt, Cromwell, William III., George II., Earl of Mansfield,\r\nDuke of Somerset, Earl of Chatham, Admiral Keppel, and others. One\r\nstriking feature of this gallery is the Gobelins tapestry (eight\r\npieces) which adorns the walls. It is in perfect preservation, and\r\nrepresents scenes in the story of Don Quixote from designs by Coypel,\r\nand appear to have been made in 1770. The walls are also adorned\r\nby many family portraits and other paintings by Reynolds, Hoppner,\r\nKneller, Smirke, Lely, Bishop, Zucchero, Stothard, and others. The\r\nappointments of this splendid room are arranged with perfect taste, and\r\nit is filled with objects of interest and beauty; one object that often\r\nattracts attention being a carved chair, bearing an inscription showing\r\nthat it was made, as is also one belonging to the Queen, from the wood\r\nof the tree at La Haye Sainte, against which the Duke of Wellington\r\ntook up his station at the battle of Waterloo. The opposite end of the\r\nRegent’s Gallery to that at which the visitor enters from the Grand\r\nStaircase is one gigantic mirror filling the whole space, and thus,\r\nin appearance, giving it a double length. From this end one doorway\r\nleads to the private gallery of the chapel, and another opens into the\r\nlibrary.\r\n\r\nThe Library is entirely of oak, the ceiling divided into compartments,\r\nwith carved bosses at the intersections, and armorial bearings\r\ndecorating other parts. Over the fire-place Grant’s fine portrait of\r\nthe late duke, “presented to his grace as a token of affection and\r\nesteem by his tenantry, 27th February, 1856,” is placed, and forms a\r\npleasant feature in the room. The collection of books is, as is natural\r\nto expect, of the most choice and costly kind, many of the literary\r\ntreasures being priceless gems of past ages. Among these are several\r\ncurious and valuable MS. rarities and sketches by the old masters.\r\n\r\nThe Picture Gallery, a noble apartment of admirable proportions, has\r\na coved ceiling, rising from a cornice richly ornamented in gold and\r\nwhite, with figures and foliage in bold relief. The collection of\r\npictures in this gallery, some two hundred in number, is remarkably\r\nfine and choice, and contains many notable examples of the best and\r\nmost reputed masters—Murillo, Rubens, Teniers, Gerard Douw, Rembrandt,\r\nClaude, Gaspar Poussin, Parmigiano, Carlo Dolce, Berghem, Carracci,\r\nGuido, Vandyke, Holbein, Bassano, Paul Veronese, Bronzino, Van der\r\nHeyden, Netscher, Van der Velde, Reynolds, Jansen, Ruysdael, Correggio,\r\nAlbert Dürer, Dekker, Schalken, Spagnoletto, Caravaggio, Wouvermans,\r\nCuyp, and a host of others.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Grand Corridor, or Ball-room._]\r\n\r\nThe Duchess’s Boudoir, a lovely room, commanding an almost enchanting\r\nview of the grounds and distant country, was the favourite apartment\r\nof the late duchess, and remains as left by her. Like the other private\r\nrooms, passages, and corridors, it contains many genuine pictures of\r\nnote as well as family portraits.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Corridor, or Ball-room, which, seen from the landing of the\r\nstaircase, is shown in the engraving on the preceding page, is one\r\nof the most striking features of the interior of the castle. It is\r\nof Gothic design, the whole being of stone, and copied from various\r\nparts of Lincoln Cathedral. It is lit by nine windows in length, with\r\nstained-glass armorial decorations, and has an elegant groined ceiling,\r\nwith carved bosses at the intersections; and the walls are arcaded,\r\nand contain full-length life-size and other portraits of the present\r\nnoble duke (two) by Grant; the late Lady John Manners, by Buckner; Lord\r\nRobert Manners, by Reynolds; and several others.\r\n\r\nThe Queen’s Sitting-room, or Green Assembling-room, in the Staunton\r\nTower, besides being an elegant apartment, commands a magnificent view\r\nof the charming grounds and the distant country, including Croxton with\r\nthe Duke’s Deer Park, Woolsthorpe, Harlaxton, the Kennels, and the\r\nLake. Adjoining this are the Chinese Rooms—a suite of bed and dressing\r\nrooms, so called from the style of their furniture and papering—which\r\nwere occupied by our beloved Queen in 1843.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Dining-room has a richly panelled ceiling of white and gold,\r\nand contains a side-table of white marble, carved by Wyatt, so as to\r\nlook like a table “covered with a white linen table napkin; the folds\r\nbeing so accurately represented in the marble as to require a close\r\ninspection to convince the observer of the solidity of the material.”\r\nIt weighs between two and three tons. In this room are magnificent\r\nexamples, life-size full-length portraits, by Sir Joshua Reynolds, and\r\nothers by Sir Godfrey Kneller.\r\n\r\nThe Elizabeth Saloon, so called after the late duchess (Elizabeth,\r\nsecond daughter of Frederick Howard, Earl of Carlisle, and wife of\r\nJohn Henry, fifth Duke of Rutland), by whose taste and judgment it was\r\narranged and decorated. The walls are hung with satin drapery, and\r\nthe ceiling, which was painted by Wyatt, is filled with mythological\r\nsubjects and family and other portraits. The furniture and appliances\r\nare sumptuous and elegant, and altogether this saloon is the most\r\ngorgeous in the castle. Among its Art treasures are a full-length\r\nmarble statue of the late duchess by Wyatt; two full-length life-size\r\nportraits of the late duke and duchess by Sanders; several rare enamels\r\nand pictures; a number of choice watercolour drawings; an extensive\r\nseries of cabinet portraits, &c.; and many cabinets, caskets, and other\r\nchoice objects.\r\n\r\nOther apartments are the King’s Rooms, so called because used by\r\nthe Prince Regent while at Belvoir; the Hunters’ Dining-room; the\r\nWellington Rooms, so named because occupied by the Duke of Wellington;\r\nthe Family Dining-room, &c., but these require no word of comment.\r\n\r\nThe Chapel, with panelled stone walls and elegant groined ceiling, has\r\na canopied reredos, containing one of Murillo’s grandest and choicest\r\nworks—the “Holy Family,” whose value is estimated at four thousand\r\nguineas.\r\n\r\nThe Wine Cellar in the Staunton Tower, with its vaulted ceiling and\r\ncarved boss with crowned monogram of the Blessed Virgin, is one of\r\nthe oldest parts of the castle. The Ale Cellar is said to contain\r\nthirty-one thousand gallons of liquor! The largest tun, which holds\r\nabout thirteen hundred gallons of ale, is called after the founder\r\nof the castle, “Robert de Todeni,” while the next three largest are\r\nnamed respectively the “Marquis of Granby,” “Lord John,” and “Lord\r\nGeorge.” The Housekeeper’s Rooms, with their fine assemblage of old\r\nChelsea, Derby, Sèvres, and other china services; the Steward’s Room;\r\nthe Plate Pantry, with the grand and invaluable services of plate; the\r\nkitchens and other offices, perhaps the most perfect of any in their\r\narrangements and appliances, are all deserving more notice than the\r\nmere mention we can give them.\r\n\r\nThe Muniment-room, under the able guardianship of Mr. Green, is, in our\r\neyes, one of the most important and interesting features of the castle,\r\nand one in which we would fain “live and move and have our being” for\r\nthe rest of our lives. It is a perfect mine of historical wealth, and\r\nas a storehouse of genealogical and antiquarian lore is unsurpassed\r\nby any other mansion. It literally overflows with deeds and MSS. of\r\none kind or other, and all in the most admirable order and condition.\r\nThe deeds in this room are above four thousand in number, the greater\r\npart of which date back to the twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, and\r\nfifteenth centuries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Duchess’s Garden._]\r\n\r\nAmong the treasures are the cartularies and registers of Belvoir Priory\r\nand Croxton Abbey; rent-rolls of Croxton; household books of various\r\nearly periods; a vast amount of original letters; personal accounts and\r\nbills relating to Haddon Hall; inventories of Riveaulx Abbey, Belvoir,\r\nCroxton, St. Dunstans-in-the-West, Haddon, &c.; plea-rolls, charters,\r\nand grants and confirmations of lands, pedigrees, agreements, &c.\r\n\r\nOne of the great glories of Belvoir, however, is its grounds and\r\nsurroundings; but to these, which to do them justice would require a\r\nspecial article to themselves, we can only devote a few brief lines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Statue Garden._]\r\n\r\nThe whole place is a labyrinth of beauty, each separate spot that we\r\ncome to exceeding in exquisite loveliness those we have passed, and\r\neach turn bringing to view fresh glimpses of charming scenery which\r\nshow how well Nature has been studied, and how thoroughly Art, with the\r\npure and accomplished taste of the late duchess, has been wedded to\r\nher. The Duchess’s Garden, below the slope on the west of the castle,\r\nis formed in an exquisite glade, surrounded on all sides by grand old\r\ntrees and luxuriant shrubs; the beds terraced one above the other,\r\nor gently sloped and planted in amphitheatre form, with masses of\r\ncolour which give a richness and peculiarity to the scene. The Duke’s\r\nWalk—an avenued path extending in its devious way for about three\r\nmiles in length—passes above this garden, and is broken by glimpses\r\nof all the varied scenery on the way, and rendered pleasant by rustic\r\nsummer-houses, seats, and other resting-places. Near to the Duchess’s\r\nGarden, in this walk, a tablet, admirably carved by the late Mr. Bath,\r\nof Haddon, bears a sonnet from the pen of the fifth duke in memory of\r\nthe duchess. It runs as follows:—\r\n\r\n  “One cultivated spot behold, which spreads\r\n    Its flowery bosom to the noontide beam—\r\n  Where num’rous rosebuds rear their blushing heads,\r\n    And poppies rich, and fragrant violets teem.\r\n  Far from the busy world’s unceasing sound—\r\n    Here has Eliza fixed her favourite seat,\r\n  Chaste emblem of the scene around—\r\n    Pure as the flower that smiles beneath her feet.”\r\n\r\nOf the character of the Duchess’s Garden a writer in the _Journal\r\nof Horticulture_ (to which we are indebted for the two beautiful\r\nengravings on pages 8 and 24), thus speaks:—“This is a beautiful glade\r\nof considerable extent, surrounded on all sides by trees of grand\r\ndimensions, which on our visit were in their early beauty, developing\r\nthose varied tints of green which, if not quite so glowing as the\r\nautumnal ones, are at any rate fresher, and, moreover, are associated\r\nwith the thoughts of the lengthening and brightening days of summer,\r\nand not with the shortening and darkening days of winter. In this glade\r\nthe natural rocks have been accommodated to the requirements of Alpine\r\ngardening, while the upper portion has been arranged in beds.” “The\r\nbedding pansies, the oxlips (of which the Belvoir strain is remarkably\r\nfine), were in flower. The beautiful _Gentiana verna_, accommodated\r\nwith nice little ledges on which its brilliant blue shone out\r\nbrilliantly, the bright yellow _Doronicum Austriacum_, and other fine\r\nplants were there. And then how beautiful were the blue forget-me-nots!\r\nhow luxuriantly fine the _Saxifraga crassifolia_! Then, again, we had\r\nthe brilliant blue of _Lithospermum prostratum_ as it trailed over the\r\nrockery, and that of its larger congener, _L. Gastoni_. Of a softer but\r\nno less beautiful shade of blue was _Myosotis dissitiflora_, though now\r\nnearly past, as it is the earliest of the tribe. Then how fine was\r\n_Veratrum nigrum_, beautiful for its foliage!” “Then there were bright\r\nmasses of _Dianthus neglectus_ and _alpinus_, with their dense tufts\r\nof lovely pink flowers; and turn which way you will, gems of rarity\r\nor beauty met the eye.” “One likes to linger on these slopes; and as\r\none stands on the upper portion of it, and looks down on the carpet of\r\nlovely green backed by the feathery and elegant foliage of the birch,\r\nit is indeed hard to be obliged to tear one’s self away from it.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Belvoir Castle, from the Stables, showing the Covered\r\nExercise-ground._]\r\n\r\nThe Statue Garden, one of the most striking “bits” in the grounds,\r\nis so called from a number of statues by Cibber which adorn it.\r\nThis garden, when viewed from the terrace, entirely screened from\r\nobservation from the castle, is one of marvellous and old-world beauty;\r\nthe majestic and venerable silver firs—remarkable for their gigantic\r\ngrowth and their hoary age—the grounds, half garden, half wood (a\r\nstrange combination of natural wildness with artificial planting),\r\nadding much to the effect of the scene.\r\n\r\nThe Dairy, the Kennels, the Stables with the covered Exercise-ground,\r\nand the Farm, as well as the magnificent Lake of ninety acres in\r\nextent, are all objects of special interest, but to them we can only\r\nthus allude.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Gardener’s Cottage._]\r\n\r\nThe Mausoleum is situated on the summit of an eminence on the opposite\r\nside of the valley from the castle, on a spot immediately facing the\r\nwindows of the Duchess’s boudoir, chosen by herself as a fit place\r\nwherein she might rest. Her grace died in 1825, and was buried at\r\nBottesford Church. In 1826 the mausoleum was commenced, and completed\r\nin 1828, when her body, and those of nine other members of the family,\r\nwere removed to it and deposited in the vault. Since then others have\r\nbeen removed there, and the “good duke” also there rests, as does the\r\nlamented Lord George Manners (brother of the present duke), who died in\r\nNovember, 1874. The mausoleum is approached by an avenue of grand old\r\nyews, which give a solemnity to the place which is eminently in keeping\r\nwith its character. The building is in the Norman style, and consists\r\nof what may perhaps be called a chapel, with apse and a projecting\r\nporch, and vaults beneath. Within the apse, lit with a flood of golden\r\nlight from above, is one of the most exquisitely beautiful pieces of\r\nsculpture it has been our good fortune to see. On it the Duchess is\r\nrepresented as rising from the admirably sculptured tomb with expanded\r\narms, and her face elevated towards the clouds, in which are seen four\r\ncherubs—the children who preceded her to the grave—one of whom is\r\nholding over her a crown of glory. It is by Wyatt, and is considered to\r\nbe his masterpiece.\r\n\r\nThe Kitchen and Fruit Gardens are about eight acres in extent within\r\nthe walls, and more than that outside. They are arranged in the most\r\neffective, convenient, and admirable manner, and managed with that care\r\nand judgment which are the distinguishing characteristics of the head\r\ngardener’s skill. His charming cottage forms one of our vignettes;\r\nit is overgrown with clematis and other climbing plants, which grow\r\nwith natural luxuriance over its porch and hedgerows. Nature, indeed,\r\nin the grounds and gardens of Belvoir, is the first, the main, and\r\nthe ultimate study; and thus at all points, and in every direction,\r\nnatural instead of artificial beauties present themselves to the eye,\r\nand give the greatest charm of all to whatever the visitor sees.\r\nWild flowers are especially cultivated and bedded out in all their\r\nnative simplicity, while numbers of Alpine and other plants are also\r\nacclimatised, and mingle their beauties with those of our own country.\r\n_Belvoir_ is indeed well named, not only for its “beautiful prospect”\r\nfrom the building itself, but its hundreds of beautiful prospects\r\nwithin its own boundaries.\r\n\r\nWell might a gifted authoress thus write on leaving so lovely a place\r\nas Belvoir Castle and its surroundings:—\r\n\r\n  “Farewell, fair castle, on thy lordly hill\r\n  Firm be thy seat, and proud thy station still:\r\n  Soft rise the breezes from the vale below—\r\n  Bright be the clouds that wander o’er thy brow:\r\n  O’er the fair lands that form thy broad domain,\r\n  Short be the winter—long the summer reign.\r\n  Pilgrim of pleasure to thy stately towers,\r\n  Fain would I leave among thy friendly bowers\r\n  Some votive offering—and, ere on my way\r\n  With many a backward glance I turn to stray,\r\n  Bid virtue, strength, and honour crown thy walls;\r\n  Joy, love, and peace abide within thy halls;\r\n  While grateful mirth and noble courtesy,\r\n  As now, for ever, hold their seat in thee;\r\n  And still upon thy lordly turrets rest\r\n  The grateful blessing of each parting guest.”\r\n\r\nThe neighbourhood of Belvoir Castle is one of great beauty, and it\r\nis rich in objects of interest both to the botanist, the naturalist,\r\nand the geologist; while to the lover of Nature it presents charms of\r\nunusual attraction. In the hills and vales surrounding the castle,\r\nnearly the whole series of lower oolitic rocks may be traced, from\r\nthe white limestone down to the black liassic shales. Capping the\r\nhills to the south, which are of greater elevation than the castle, is\r\nthe inferior oolite, or rather a variety of it called “Lincolnshire\r\nlimestone,” a hard, light rock, very rich in fossil remains. On these\r\nhills the growth of trees is stunted, but the ground is covered with a\r\nprofusion of lovely flowers. Underlying the oolite is the upper lias\r\nclay, rich in fossils and shells. Belvoir Castle itself stands on the\r\nextremity of a long northern spur of these hills, upon the middle lias,\r\nor marlstone, which caps all the neighbouring heights, and gives their\r\nsoil a remarkably red tinge. It is very rich in iron, both in veins and\r\nin lump ore. The vale of Belvoir, below the castle, towards the north,\r\nlies mostly upon the lower lias, which is celebrated for its richness\r\nin fossil remains, some of the ammonites here found being of gigantic\r\nsize. The vale is, however, best known to geologists on account of\r\nits sauria, which are both numerous and well preserved. In the old\r\nriver-ways and hollows of the vale, in the drift, are also found traces\r\nof the mammoth, gigantic antlers, and other remains of extinct races of\r\nanimals, which through untold ages have been hidden from sight.\r\n\r\nOur views of Belvoir, we may add, are engraved from photographs, taken\r\nspecially for the purpose, by Mr. R. Keene, and by Mr. George Green.\r\n\r\nBottesford Church, a fine structure of the Perpendicular period, with a\r\nlofty crocketed spire, is mainly interesting as being the resting-place\r\nfor several of the old monuments of the successive owners of Belvoir,\r\nremoved hither from the priories of Belvoir and Croxton, and as the\r\nburial-place of several generations of the family of Manners. The\r\nearliest of the monuments is one which has been variously ascribed to\r\nRobert de Todeni and the third William de Albini: if to either, it\r\nmost probably commemorates the latter of these. Other early monuments\r\nare to members of the De Ros family. Among these are William de Ros,\r\n1414; Margaret, his wife; and John, Lord Ros. Among the monuments of\r\nthe Manners family are those of Thomas, first Earl of Rutland, and his\r\ncountess, 1543; Henry, Earl of Rutland, and Margaret, his countess,\r\n1563; Edward, third Earl of Rutland, 1587; John, fourth Earl of\r\nRutland, 1588; Roger, fifth Earl of Rutland, 1612; Francis, sixth Earl\r\nof Rutland (and his “two sonnes, both which dyed in their infancy, by\r\nwicked practice and sorcerye”), 1632; George, seventh Earl of Rutland,\r\n1641; John, eighth Earl of Rutland, and his countess, 1670; and others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRENTHAM.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRENTHAM, the magnificent seat of his Grace the Duke of Sutherland,\r\nis beautifully situated not far from the rise of the river Trent, in\r\none of the most charming parts of Staffordshire. Its nearest town is\r\nNewcastle-under-Lyme, closely adjacent to the most important centre of\r\nBritish industry, the Pottery district, rendered famous in the world of\r\ncommerce by its vast productions, which supply every civilised country,\r\nand in the world of Art by the “things of beauty” produced by its\r\nmatchless artists, and which will literally remain a “joy for ever,” in\r\nwhatever place they may be preserved.\r\n\r\nThe history of Trentham is not one that requires much attention, for,\r\nunlike many other places, it has had no stirring historical incidents\r\nconnected with it, and its story is therefore one of peace. Its\r\nvicissitudes have not been unpleasant ones, not one scene of rapine\r\nor war or murder being recorded in its annals; and it has become\r\nthe “home”—literally the most charming and comfortable of English\r\nhomes—of one of our greatest nobles, where domestic comforts take\r\nthe place of state and ceremony, and homelike surroundings supplant\r\nunmeaning grandeur.\r\n\r\nTrentham Monastery was, it is stated, founded by Ethelred, who\r\nsucceeded his brother Wulphere as King of Mercia in 675, and who\r\ninduced his niece Werburgh (daughter of Wulphere) “to leave the\r\nreligious house at Ely, where she was abbess, to superintend the\r\nnunnery he had built at Trentham, as well as other similar religious\r\nfoundations in Mercia—viz. Hanbury, near Burton-on-Trent; Repton\r\n(the capital of the Mercian kingdom), in Derbyshire; and Weedon, in\r\nNorthamptonshire. Werburgh died at Trentham, after leading a long\r\nand pious and eminently useful life, and, being shortly afterwards\r\ncanonised, became one of the most celebrated of Anglo-Saxon saints. It\r\nis supposed that the original site of St. Werburgh’s Nunnery was at\r\nHanchurch, about a mile from Trentham, the spot being marked by some\r\nvenerable yews of great antiquity, which still form three sides of a\r\nsquare. It was called Tricengham, and is by that name described by\r\nTanner, Dugdale, and others.\r\n\r\nThere is no record for the next four hundred years; but in the Domesday\r\nsurvey a priest is mentioned as being there. In the time of William\r\nRufus (1027 to 1100), the priory having been restored or rebuilt by the\r\nEarl of Chester, “the prior and canons entered upon Trentham by a deed\r\nof gift from Hugh, first Earl of Chester; and a deed of institution\r\nby Roger de Clinton, Bishop of Lichfield (1139), describes John, the\r\nprior, as instituted to the priory of Trentham and its appendages, on\r\nthe presentation of the Empress Maude, at a synod held at Lichfield.”\r\nThe building appears to have been continued by the fourth Earl of\r\nChester, as the charter, commonly known as the deed of “Restoration,”\r\nis that of Randle, the fourth earl (about 1152). It is the remains\r\nof this building which have furnished the fine Norman pillars of\r\nthe present church. In 1162 the church of Sutton-en-le-Felde, in\r\nDerbyshire, was given to Trentham by Ralph de Boscherville. The\r\nchapelries of Whitmore and Newcastle also belonged to it; and soon\r\nafter this date Hugh Kyveliok, Earl of Chester, gave to it the church\r\nof Bettesford. In the next century Clayton Griffith became an appanage\r\nof the priory, as did Over-Elkiston. In 1321 the advowson was claimed\r\nby the Earl of Lancaster, who instituted a prior (Richard of Dilhorne),\r\nwhose election was afterwards confirmed by the King.\r\n\r\nEarly in the reign of Henry VI. the priory obtained from the King in\r\nvery express terms a confirmation and enlargement of former grants.\r\nAfter reciting the original deeds of gift of Henry II. and Randolph,\r\nEarl of Chester, the King bestows on “my Canons of Trentham” “Crofts\r\nfor cultivation, and all other lands belonging to the manor (_in\r\nmalo territoris_), and the two moores on either side of the village\r\nbetween the wood and the river of Trentham for the purpose of being\r\nmade into meadow land for the maintenance of the brotherhood and of the\r\nhospitalities of the house.... And forbid any man to sue them at law\r\nin opposition to this deed, except in my own court.” Given at Dover,\r\n23rd of May, 6th Henry VI. In the latter part of this deed the prior\r\nis described as abbot. The _territorium_ which was to be taken into\r\ncultivation appears to have been the land extending from the King’s\r\nWood and the High Greaves, and North Wood down to the river. The field\r\nlying on the sloping ground between the farmhouse of North Wood and the\r\nriver is still called the Prior’s More, or Moor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Trentham, from Monument Hill, Tittensor._]\r\n\r\nAfter the dissolution of the monasteries in 1531, the priory of\r\nTrentham (whose last prior was Thomas Bradwell, who, elected 22nd\r\nHenry VIII., held office at the time), whose annual value was returned\r\nat £106 2_s._ 9_d._ clear, was granted, in 1539, to Charles Brandon,\r\nDuke of Suffolk, brother-in-law to Henry VIII., and afterwards came\r\ninto the possession of the Levesons, a Staffordshire family of great\r\nantiquity seated at Willenhall. Nicholas Leveson, Lord Mayor of\r\nLondon, died in the year that Trentham was granted to the Duke of\r\nSuffolk. His great-grandson, Sir John Leveson, left two daughters only,\r\nhis co-heiresses, one of whom, Frances, by marrying Sir Thomas Gower of\r\nSittenham, carried Trentham and other extensive possessions into this\r\nancient Yorkshire family, which dates from the Conquest.\r\n\r\nSir Richard Leveson was distinguished as a naval commander. He is\r\nconsidered to be the subject of the fine old plaintive ballad “The\r\nSpanish Lady’s Love,” although the same honour has been ascribed to Sir\r\nJohn Bolle, for he accompanied the Earl of Nottingham in his expedition\r\nagainst Cadiz when he was twenty-seven years of age. The ballad, one of\r\nthe best in our language, tells the story of a “Spanish lady” “by birth\r\nand parentage of high degree,” who, being detained as a prisoner by the\r\nEnglish captain, was so overcome with his kindness that she conceived a\r\nviolent attachment towards him; so much so, indeed, that when—\r\n\r\n    “... At last there came commandment\r\n      For to set the ladies free,\r\n    With all their jewels still adornéd,\r\n      None to do them injury;\r\n  Then said this lady gay, ‘Full woe is me!\r\n  O, let me still sustain this kind captivity!\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Thou hast set this present day my body free,\r\n  But my heart in prison strong remains with thee.’”\r\n\r\nThe captain urged many objections, each one of which in turn she argued\r\naway and removed, even when he said—\r\n\r\n  “I have neither gold nor silver\r\n    To maintain thee in this case,\r\n  And to travel is great charges\r\n    As you know in every place.”\r\n\r\nShe answered—\r\n\r\n  “My chains and jewels every one shall be thine own,\r\n  And the five hundred pounds in gold that lies unknown.”\r\n\r\nAt length, finding all other argument useless, he is made boldly to\r\ndeclare—\r\n\r\n    “I in England have already\r\n      A sweet woman to my wife;\r\n  I will not falsify my vow for gold or gain,\r\n  Nor yet for all the fairest dames that live in Spain.”\r\n\r\nTo which she makes him the magnanimous answer—\r\n\r\n    “Oh! how happy is that woman\r\n      That enjoys so true a friend!\r\n    Many happy days God send her!\r\n      Of my suit I’ll make an end:\r\n  On my knees I pardon crave for this offence,\r\n  Which love and true affection did first commence.\r\n\r\n    Commend me to thy loving lady,\r\n      Bear to her this chain of gold\r\n    And these bracelets for a token,\r\n      Grieving that I was so bold:\r\n  All my jewels in like sort bear thou with thee,\r\n  For they are fitting for thy wife, and not for me.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Statue of Sir Richard Leveson in the Court-yard at\r\nTrentham._]\r\n\r\nAnd she, taking an affecting leave of him, declares her intention of\r\nspending her days in prayer in a nunnery. Sir Richard married the\r\ndaughter of the famous Earl of Nottingham, who was Lord High Admiral\r\nand Commander-in-chief of the fleet which defeated the Armada.\r\nSir Richard Leveson, who was in this engagement, was, in 1601,\r\nmade Vice-Admiral, and died in 1605. In the collegiate church at\r\nWolverhampton was formerly a “stately monument in black marble erected\r\nto his memory, by which were two brass plates, the one inscribed with\r\nthe chief events of his life, registered at length in Latin,” and the\r\nother in English, erected by Sir Richard Leveson. It was executed by\r\nLe Sueur for £300, the original contract being still preserved at\r\nTrentham. During the civil wars “this bronze effigy was ordered by the\r\nCommittee of Sequestrations at Stafford to be taken away and cast into\r\ncannon; but by the timely interposition of Lady Leveson, the Admiral’s\r\nwidow, it was redeemed for a sum of money, and deposited in Lilleshall\r\nChurch till the strife was over. The marble monument being destroyed,\r\nit now occupies a niche in the church of Wolverhampton,” and a copy is\r\npreserved in a recess in the court-yard at Trentham.\r\n\r\nSir Richard Leveson, Knight of the Bath, M.P. for Shropshire, and\r\nafterwards for Newcastle-under-Lyme, was devoted to the cause of\r\nCharles I. He made his residence at Trentham, “being accounted one of\r\nthe best housekeepers and landlords in the county. In consequence of\r\nhis adherence to the royal cause, his property was sequestrated, for\r\nwhich he compounded by the payment of more than £6,000—the largest\r\ncomposition obtained. A letter of his to the Governor of Shrewsbury\r\nstrikingly indicates the distresses sustained even by persons of\r\ndistinction during those troubled times:—\r\n\r\n  “_S^r_\r\n\r\n “Since the unhappy surprise of Stafford by the rebelles, the place\r\n where I am is not safe, either for myselfe or my goodes, and therefore\r\n I have sent 2 wagons loaded with some household stuffe, which I\r\n desire, with your dispensacon, may be received into your towne of\r\n Shrewsbury, into a roome which I have longe reserved in myne owne\r\n handes for this purpose against a tyme of neede; and that to this\r\n effecte you will please to give order unto your watch for free passage\r\n to and fro, whereby you will oblige mee more and more to remayne\r\n\r\n  “Yo^r ever affectionate frende\r\n  “R. LEVESON.”\r\n\r\n  “LILLESHALL LODGE, _16 May, 1643_.\r\n\r\n  “To my much respected frende\r\n  “S^R FRANCIS OTELEY, Kt\r\n  “Governour of Shrewsbury—Haste these.”\r\n\r\nThe Sir Richard Leveson who built the old hall at Trentham in 1633\r\n(two views of which are given in Plot) died in 1661. His widow, Lady\r\nKatharine Leveson (daughter of Robert, Duke of Northumberland, and\r\nLady Alice Dudley), was a great benefactress to the parish. She died\r\nat Trentham in 1674, and was buried at Lilleshall. Her charities\r\nwere almost boundless. Sir Richard Leveson dying without issue, the\r\nTrentham estates passed to his sister and co-heiress, who had married\r\nSir Thomas Gower, and in the Gower family they have remained to this\r\nday. Sir William Leveson-Gower, his second son, who inherited the\r\nestates on the deaths of his elder brother and nephew, married Lady\r\nJane Granville, eldest daughter of the Earl of Bath, by whom he had\r\nissue, with others, Sir John Leveson-Gower, who in 1703 was created\r\nBaron Gower of Sittenham. He married Catherine, daughter of the first\r\nDuke of Rutland, by whom he had four sons and two daughters. The eldest\r\nof these sons, John, was in 1746 advanced to the dignity of Viscount\r\nTrentham and Earl Gower. He was married three times: first, to Evelyn,\r\ndaughter of the Duke of Kingston, by whom he had four sons and seven\r\ndaughters; secondly, to Penelope, daughter of Sir John Stonehouse, by\r\nwhom he had one daughter; and, thirdly, to Lady Mary Tufton, daughter\r\nof the Earl of Thanet, by whom he had three sons and one daughter,\r\none of whom was the famed Admiral John Leveson-Gower. His lordship\r\nwas succeeded by his third son by his first wife, Granville Leveson\r\nGower, who in 1786 was raised to the dignity of Marquis of Stafford. He\r\nmarried three times: first, Elizabeth Fazakerly, by whom he had a son,\r\nwho died in infancy; second, Lady Louisa Egerton, daughter of the first\r\nDuke of Bridgewater, by whom he had issue a son, George Granville,\r\nwho succeeded him, and three daughters (Lady Louisa, married to Sir\r\nArchibald Macdonald; Lady Caroline, married to Frederick, Earl of\r\nCarlisle; and Lady Anne, married to Edward Vernon Harcourt, Archbishop\r\nof York); third, Lady Susan Stewart, daughter of the Earl of Galloway,\r\nby whom he had issue one son, Granville Leveson-Gower, created Baron\r\nLeveson of Stone, and Viscount and Earl Granville (who married Lady\r\nHarriet Elizabeth Cavendish, daughter of the fifth Duke of Devonshire,\r\nand was father of the present eminent statesman, Earl Granville), and\r\nthree daughters—viz. Lady Georgiana Augusta, married to the Earl of\r\nSt. Germains; Lady Charlotte Sophia, married to the Duke of Beaufort;\r\nand Lady Susanna, married to the Earl of Harrowby. The Marquis, who\r\nheld many important public offices, died in 1803, and was succeeded by\r\nhis eldest son—\r\n\r\nGeorge Granville Leveson-Gower, as second Marquis of Stafford. This\r\nnobleman married, in 1785, Elizabeth, Countess of Sutherland and\r\nBaroness Strathnaver (a title dating from 1228), and was, in 1833,\r\nadvanced to the dignity of Duke of Sutherland. His grace, who had been\r\ncalled to the Upper House during his father’s lifetime as Baron Gower,\r\nbecame heir to the Duke of Bridgewater, and thus added immense wealth\r\nto the family property. He had surviving issue two sons—viz. George\r\nGranville, by whom he was succeeded, and Lord Francis, who took the\r\nname and arms of Egerton, by sign-manual, in 1833, and was raised to\r\nthe peerage as Earl of Ellesmere in 1846 (he married Harriet Catherine,\r\neldest daughter of Charles Greville, Esq., by whom he had issue, with\r\nothers, the second Earl of Ellesmere, and Admiral Egerton, who married\r\nLady Louisa Cavendish, daughter of the present Duke of Devonshire)—and\r\ntwo daughters, viz. Lady Charlotte Sophia, married to the Duke of\r\nNorfolk; and Lady Elizabeth Mary, married to Richard, Marquis of\r\nWestminster, father of the present Duke of Westminster.\r\n\r\nA noble colossal bronze statue of the Duke (who died in 1833), the\r\nfigure being sixteen feet in height, and placed on a lofty column on\r\nTittensor Hill (called “Monument Hill”), forms a conspicuous object\r\nagainst the sky from the house and gardens of Trentham. It is one\r\nof Chantrey’s masterpieces of Art. The column, base, and steps were\r\ndesigned by Barry. The entire height is fifty-nine feet, including the\r\nfigure. It bears the following appropriate inscription:—\r\n\r\n  IN LASTING MEMORIAL OF\r\n  GEORGE GRANVILLE,\r\n  DUKE OF SUTHERLAND, MARQUIS OF STAFFORD, K.G.\r\n  AN UPRIGHT AND PATRIOTIC NOBLEMAN,\r\n  A JUDICIOUS, KIND, AND LIBERAL LANDLORD;\r\n  WHO IDENTIFIED THE IMPROVEMENT OF HIS VAST ESTATES WITH\r\n  THE PROSPERITY OF ALL WHO CULTIVATED THEM;\r\n  A PUBLIC YET UNOSTENTATIOUS BENEFACTOR,\r\n  WHO, WHILE HE PROVIDED USEFUL EMPLOYMENT\r\n  FOR THE ACTIVE LABOURER,\r\n  OPENED WIDE HIS HAND TO THE DISTRESSES OF THE WIDOW\r\n  THE SICK, AND THE TRAVELLER;\r\n  A MOURNING AND GRATEFUL TENANTRY,\r\n  UNITING WITH THE INHABITANTS OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD,\r\n  ERECTED THIS PILLAR A.D. MDCCCXXXIV.\r\n\r\nGeorge Granville Leveson-Gower, second Duke of Sutherland, was called\r\nto the Upper House during his father’s lifetime as Baron Gower. He\r\nwas born in 1786, and married, in 1823, the Lady Harriet Elizabeth\r\nGeorgiana Howard, daughter of the Earl of Carlisle. By this happy\r\nunion his grace had issue four sons and seven daughters. Among these\r\nwere—the present Duke of Sutherland, of whom more presently; Lord\r\nAlbert Sutherland Leveson-Gower, who married, in 1872, a daughter of\r\nSir Thomas Nevill Abdy, Bart., and died in 1874, leaving issue one\r\ninfant; Lord Ronald Charles Leveson-Gower, late M.P. for Sutherland;\r\nLady Elizabeth Georgiana, married, in 1844, to the present Duke of\r\nArgyll, and is mother of the Marquis of Lorne; Lady Evelyn, married to\r\nLord Blantyre; Lady Caroline, married to the Duke of Leinster; and Lady\r\nConstance Gertrude, married to the present Duke of Westminster. His\r\nGrace the Duke of Sutherland died in 1861, aged seventy-four, and was\r\nburied in the Mausoleum at Trentham. He was a man of liberal, kindly,\r\ngentle, and benevolent disposition, and was beloved by people of every\r\nclass; indeed, such was the affectionate attachment of his tenants,\r\nthat after his death they erected statues to his memory on most of his\r\nestates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Monument of Harriet, Duchess of Sutherland, Trentham\r\nChurch._]\r\n\r\nThe Duchess, whose refined taste, attachment to Art, amiability of\r\ndisposition, winning manners, and energetic character were beyond\r\npraise, died in 1868, and was also buried in the mausoleum at Trentham.\r\nShe was Mistress of the Robes to the Queen, by whom she was esteemed\r\nas a beloved friend. To her pure taste Trentham owes many of its most\r\nattractive features, and had she lived to carry out the full bent of\r\nher inclination, much more would have been accomplished. A chastely\r\nbeautiful altar-tomb, with a recumbent effigy of the Duchess, by Noble,\r\nhas been erected in Trentham Church, and is one of the highest and\r\npurest achievements of sculptural Art. “Recurring to the monument in\r\nTrentham Church,” says the Rev. Prebendary Edwards, “it tells us,\r\nthough in silence, of a rare combination of affection, thought, and\r\nartistic skill in all who have been engaged upon it. It could not have\r\nbeen confided to better hands than Mr. Noble’s, who, as sculptor, has\r\nhad his heart in his work. Resting in calm and the deepest repose,\r\nas between life and death, the figure recalls with wonderful truth\r\nthe beauty of feature and gentleness of expression of her whom it\r\nrepresents.” The monument is placed at the east end of the south aisle,\r\nand the sculptor has been happy in finding a spot for his marble where\r\nthe light of a south window falls on the countenance of the figure\r\non the tomb beneath. The floor is laid with encaustic tiles, bearing\r\nthe arms of the family and the initials of the deceased. The monument\r\ncontains the following inscription, written by Mr. Gladstone:—\r\n\r\n  HENRIETTÆ DUCISSÆ DE SUTHERLAND\r\n  FIDO MARMORE DESCRIPTA EFFIGIES\r\n  EJUS CARISSIMA IMAGO\r\n  NUNQUAM NON VIDEBITUR INTER SUOS MORARI\r\n  QUIPPE QUÆ ET MULTUM ET A MULTIS AMATA\r\n  HAUD SCIAS AN NON MAGIS IPSA AMAVERIT\r\n  EGREGIA MENTIS ET FORMÆ DOTIBUS\r\n  GNATA SOROR UXOR MATER PARENS\r\n  ABSOLUTISSIMA\r\n  HABUIT INSUPER E CORDIS BENEVOLENTIA\r\n  QUOD IN AMICOS LARGE DIMANARET\r\n  DULCEDINUM ET DELICIARUM OMNIA\r\n  QUEIS FRUI DATUM EST HOMINIBUS\r\n  ILLI CARPERE DIUTIUS LICUIT\r\n  ILLI QUOD RIRIUS CIRCA SE DIFFUNDERE\r\n  SUB EXTREMUM VITÆ SPATIUM\r\n  ETIAM IN DOLORIBUS SPECTATA\r\n  NUSQUAM MEDIOCREM SE PRÆBUIT\r\n  DENIQUE DEI OPT.

I only share with him in the love and reverence\r\nwhich prompted it. SUTHERLAND, 1871.”\r\n\r\nThe present noble peer, George Granville William Sutherland\r\nLeveson-Gower, third Duke of Sutherland, Marquis of Stafford, Earl\r\nGower, Viscount Trentham, Baron Gower of Sittenham, in the peerage\r\nof the United Kingdom; Earl of Sutherland and Lord Strathnaver\r\nin the peerage of Scotland; Knight of the Garter and a Baronet;\r\nLord-Lieutenant of Cromartie and of Sutherland, was born December 19th,\r\n1828, and succeeded his father in his titles and estates in 1861,\r\nhaving previously sat (as Marquis of Stafford) as M.P. for Sutherland\r\nfrom 1852 to 1861. He married in 1849 Anne (born 1829), daughter and\r\nonly child of John Hay Mackenzie, Esq., created in her own right, in\r\n1861, Countess of Cromartie, Viscountess Tarbat, Baroness Castle-Avon,\r\nand Baroness McLeod, all in the peerage of the United Kingdom, with\r\nremainder to her eldest surviving son. By this lady (who has held the\r\nappointment of Mistress of the Robes to the Queen) the Duke has issue,\r\nliving, two sons and two daughters. These are—Cromartie Sutherland\r\nLeveson-Gower, Marquis Stafford, M.P. for Sutherlandshire (heir to the\r\ndukedom), who was born in 1851, educated at Eton, and is in the Life\r\nGuards; Francis Sutherland Leveson-Gower, Viscount Tarbat (heir to\r\nthe earldom of Cromartie), born in 1852; the Lady Florence, born in\r\n1855; and the Lady Alexandra, born in 1866. His grace (who accompanied\r\nH.R.H. the Prince of Wales to India in 1875-6) is patron of thirteen\r\nlivings—viz. Trentham, Blurton, Sheriff Hales, Hanford, Barlaston,\r\nand Normacott, in Staffordshire; and Donnington Wood, Pains Lane,\r\nKinnersley, Lilleshall, Longdon-upon-Terne, Ketley, and Donington, in\r\nShropshire.\r\n\r\nThe arms of the Duke of Sutherland are—quarterly, 1 and 4, barry of\r\neight, _argent_ and _gules_, a cross fleury, _sable_, for Gower; 2,\r\n_azure_, three laurel-leaves, _or_, for Leveson; 3, _gules_, three\r\nmullets, _or_, within a bordure, _or_, charged with a double tressure\r\nflory counter-flory, _gules_, for Sutherland. Crests—1st, a goat’s\r\nhead erased, _ermine_, for Leveson; 2nd, a wolf passant, _argent_,\r\ncollared and lined, _or_, for Gower; 3rd, a cat-a-mountain, _proper_,\r\nfor Sutherland. Supporters—dexter, a wolf (locally called a “gower”),\r\n_argent_, collared and lined, _or_; sinister, a savage, wreathed\r\nabout the temples and loins with laurels, holding in his dexter hand a\r\nclub, resting on his shoulder, all _proper_, and supporting with his\r\nsinister hand an antique shield, charged with the arms of the ancient\r\nfamily of Sutherland in proper blazonry. Motto—“Frangas non flectes”\r\n(You may break, but shall not bend me). The arms of the Duke are\r\nengraved on our initial letter (page 32). The principal seats of the\r\nDuke are—Trentham, Staffordshire; Dunrobin Castle, Golspie, Scotland;\r\nLilleshall, Shropshire; Loch Inver House, Sutherland; House of Tongue,\r\nSutherland; Tarbat House, Ross-shire; Castle Leod, Dingwall; and\r\nStafford House, St. James’s, London.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The South Front, from the Italian Gardens._]\r\n\r\nThe old hall at Trentham, previously referred to, and which was usually\r\ncalled Trentham Priory, through having been built on the foundations\r\nof that religious house, was altered and enlarged, and in the main\r\nrebuilt, by the second duke. The work was intrusted to Sir Charles\r\nBarry, and was commenced in 1834, and carried out at a cost of about\r\n£150,000. It had, however, previously undergone much alteration at the\r\nhands of Mr. Tatham, who endeavoured to approximate it, in appearance,\r\nto the old Buckingham Palace.\r\n\r\n\r\nPURSUING the carriage-way to Trentham, the visitor passes to the\r\nhouse from the park through a pair of gates, the posts of which are\r\nsurmounted with life-size bronze stags. In the centre of the circular\r\ndrive is a fine bronze statue of Diana at the chase. The carriage\r\nporch, which, unlike the rest of the building, is of solid stone, forms\r\na square, arched upon columns, with an entablature and attic surmounted\r\nwith a balustrade, and piers and bases. Over the arches are the arms\r\nof the Duke, boldly carved in stone; the supporters, wolves, as large\r\nas life. From this porch the entrance door opens into an elegant\r\nsemicircular corridor, which is one of the prettiest features of the\r\nplace. To the left, on entering, the corridor leads to the Entrance\r\nHall, Grand Staircase, Billiard, and other rooms; and, on the right, to\r\nthe Private Conservatory, Drawing-room, the private rooms, &c.; while\r\nin front it encloses the West Court, with its shell-fountain, statue of\r\n“Venus rising from the Bath,” and other attractions.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to minutely describe the various rooms of this\r\ncharming and purely domestic “Home,” nor to observe any consecutive\r\narrangement regarding those upon which we may remark. All we need do is\r\nto briefly allude to some of the apartments, and then pass on to the\r\ncharming grounds—the glory of Trentham.\r\n\r\nAmong the more notable rooms are the following:—The Venetian Room,\r\nor the Duchess’s Boudoir, is, without exception, the most perfect gem\r\nof a room which any mansion can boast. It, as well as the Duke’s Room\r\nand Private Dining-room, opens from the corridor to the private rooms,\r\nlined with presses of books, and is lighted by three windows in the\r\nsouth front. The walls are divided into five large panels, painted by\r\nClarkson Stanfield, in his best and most brilliant style, with scenes\r\nin Venice; the panels being separated from each other, and surrounded\r\nby gilt reticulated work on a crimson velvet ground. Of the furnishing\r\nand decorations of this exquisite apartment it is enough to say that\r\nit is arranged with that refined and faultlessly pure taste, which can\r\nnowhere be expected to be better shown than in the surroundings of so\r\ngood and amiable and accomplished a woman as the Duchess of Sutherland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The South Front, with Grecian Temple._]\r\n\r\nThe Duke’s Room closely adjoins this apartment. It is fitted with\r\npresses filled with the choicest and most rare printed books and\r\nmanuscripts, and contains some remarkably fine paintings. Among the\r\nliterary treasures here preserved we cannot forbear noting the original\r\nmanuscript of old John Gower’s poems, in his own handwriting, and, as\r\nshown by an inscription at the commencement, presented by the poet\r\nto King Henry IV., on his coronation, and given back to the family\r\nof Gower, some centuries later, by Sir Thomas Fairfax; and among the\r\ntreasures of Art, of which there are many, is one of the original\r\n“first fifty” copies of the Portland vase by old Josiah Wedgwood, in\r\nperfect preservation. And here it may be well to note that through\r\nthe kind thoughtfulness of the Duke on our visit, we were shown a\r\nfine and remarkably interesting old Wedgwood jasper chimney-piece in\r\nthe Bath-room; it is one of the best remaining specimens. Adjoining\r\nthe Venetian Room, on the other side, is the Private Dining-room, the\r\nwalls of which are hung with a fine collection of landscapes by Penry\r\nWilliams, and paintings by other artists. Leading to the corridor, at\r\none end, is the Private Arcade, at the extremity of which, next to the\r\nDuke’s Room, has recently been placed Noble’s magnificent statue of\r\nthe late duke—a work of Art which takes rank with any of that eminent\r\nsculptor’s productions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Conservatory and Private Wing, South Front._]\r\n\r\nThe Dining-room, at the east end of the south terrace, contains some\r\nchoice sculpture by Antonio Sola, Wolff, and others, and some gigantic\r\nvases of Minton’s creation. Adjoining this is the Marble Hall, or\r\nAnte Dining-room, lighted from the ceiling, and containing, besides\r\na fine sculptured figure of Canning—copied from that by Chantrey\r\nin Westminster Abbey—a full-length life-size portrait of the late\r\nHarriet, Duchess of Sutherland, by Winterhalter. The Breakfast-room,\r\namong its other pictorial treasures, contains Wilkie’s “Breakfast,”\r\npainted for the first duke; Gainsborough’s “Landscape with Sheep;”\r\nJackson’s “Infant Moses,” exhibited in 1818; Callcott’s “Italian\r\nLandscape,” and other paintings by Poussin, Stothard, Moulson,\r\nFrearson, Rogers, Wilson, &c.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Private Conservatory._]\r\n\r\nThe Library, which contains a marvellous collection of choice and\r\nvaluable books, is enriched by a frieze from the Elgin and Phigalean\r\nmarbles, and is a charming and highly interesting room. In the Saloon,\r\nor Music-room, a pretty apartment whose ceiling is supported on\r\npilasters, are some exquisite family busts, a charming bust of the late\r\nduchess by Noble, and other attractions. The carpet is characterized\r\nby the same pattern as the terrace garden. The Drawing-room, with its\r\nsweetly pretty painted ceiling, contains many good pictures: among\r\nthese are Hofland’s “Storm off the Coast at Scarborough;” Sir Thomas\r\nLawrence’s portraits of Lord Francis Leveson-Gower (Egerton), and of\r\nthe second Duke of Sutherland; Vandyke’s “Children of Charles I.;”\r\nCharles Landseer’s “Benediction,” and others. The Billiard-room has\r\na lofty coved ceiling, and was the Great Hall of the old mansion. In\r\nit are Winterhalter’s grand full-length figure of Queen Victoria,\r\npresented by her Majesty to the late duchess; a copy of Reynolds’s\r\nportrait of George III.; Romney’s portrait of Queen Charlotte, Lord\r\nChancellor Thurlow, and the first Marquis of Stafford, and others.\r\n\r\nIn the Entrance Hall is a copy of Michael Angelo’s statue of “Thought;”\r\nand on the Grand Staircase is a rich assemblage of family and other\r\nportraits. In the various bed-rooms and other apartments, too, are\r\ncontained a vast number of valuable paintings and works of Art.\r\n\r\nThe Private Conservatory, however, is one of the “gems” of Trentham,\r\nand is as elegant in its arrangements and decorations as the most\r\nfastidious taste can desire or Art accomplish. Of this miniature “world\r\nof flowers” we give an engraving, from a special photograph taken by\r\nHarrison, but of its Eastern splendour of rich colours we can offer\r\nno idea. It is a square apartment, with Italian windows and trellised\r\nwalls, and is also trellised between the lights of the ceiling. In the\r\ncentre is a fine figure of “Venus at the Bath.” The noble ferns and the\r\nexotic and other plants are of the choicest kinds, and the arrangement\r\nof colour, especially when all are lighted from the number of lamps\r\nsuspended from the roof, is exquisitely beautiful.\r\n\r\nA pleasant feature of Trentham is the Bowling Alley—formerly the\r\nOrangery Arcade—which affords an almost unique and very pleasing\r\nindoor pastime for the family and friends. This feature, we believe,\r\nwas much enjoyed by the Shah on his visit to Trentham, which was\r\nrendered lavishly enjoyable to him in every conceivable way.\r\n\r\nFrom the Entrance Hall a doorway opens into the Church, which thus\r\nbecomes not only the parish church, but the private chapel of the Duke.\r\nThe Church thus forms a part of, or at all events is attached to, the\r\nhouse; and the transition from the elegances of modern life to the\r\ngrand old house of prayer is very striking and solemn. The Church,\r\nwhich was restored in 1842 at the cost of the Duke, by Sir Charles\r\nBarry, is the nave of the old abbey of Trentham, the chancel having\r\nextended considerably beyond the present east wall of the churchyard.\r\nThe Church, as it now exists, consists of a nave with clerestory,\r\nnorth and south aisles, and chancel, with a mortuary chapel at the\r\neast end of the south aisle. The pillars which divide the aisles from\r\nthe nave are Norman, and are the original pillars, carefully replaced\r\nand restored, of the old priory; from them now spring acutely pointed\r\narches of a later, and consequently incongruous, character. The\r\nchancel is divided from the nave by an elaborate oak screen of late but\r\ngood character, the altar-piece, by Hilton, being the “Taking down from\r\nthe Cross.” There is an eagle lectern at the east end of the nave; and\r\nthe pulpit is hung with a fine Moorish horsecloth, elaborately worked\r\nin silver on crimson velvet. At the west end is a gallery forming the\r\nfamily pew. At the back of this, beneath the window, is a bust of\r\nthe late duke; on the south side, a bust, by Noble, of a son of the\r\npresent duke, who died young; and, on the north side, a tablet to Lord\r\nFrederick Leveson-Gower, who lost his life during the Crimean war. At\r\nthe same end of the Church is a poor’s box, bearing date 1698. The\r\nfont, the gift of the parishioners, is also at the west end.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Trentham Church._]\r\n\r\nIn the Memorial Chapel, besides the exquisitely beautiful altar-tomb\r\nto the late duchess by Noble, to which we have already referred, are\r\nmonuments and tablets to the Levesons and Gowers; and here, too, is\r\nplaced a memorial bust to Lord Albert, recently deceased. Of the\r\nbeautiful monument to the late duchess we have given an engraving on\r\npage 40, copied from a clever photograph by M. De Tejada, taken from\r\nthe admirable picture by Mr. John O’Connor, painted, we believe, for\r\nLord Ronald Gower, and in his lordship’s possession. In the north wall\r\nof the Church is a recessed arched tomb, on which lie the fragments of\r\na highly interesting effigy in chain-mail, dug up in the churchyard a\r\nfew years ago; and over the north door are the royal arms, dated 1663,\r\npierced with Parliamentarian bullets.[40]\r\n\r\nOne feature yet remains to be noted; it is the introduction on the\r\nnorth wall of encaustic wall-tiles, each one of which, enclosed in a\r\nreticulated pattern, bears a memorial of some departed parishioner, in\r\nmanner following:—\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n                                   +\r\n\r\n                             JAMES SHELDON\r\n                          DEPARTED THIS LIFE\r\n                            JULY 3RD, 1822,\r\n                               AGED 49.\r\n                      +                          +\r\n                                 ALSO\r\n                            IANE HIS WIFE,\r\n                           APRIL 3RD, 1851,\r\n                               AGED 74.\r\n\r\n                                   +]\r\n\r\nThese, which are many in number, are arranged above the oak lining on\r\nthe seats, and have appropriate texts, &c., also in tiles, running\r\nabove and below the series. It is a pretty and very lasting, as well\r\nas inexpensive, kind of memorial, and one that might with advantage be\r\nadopted in many churches. In the churchyard are the remains of a cross,\r\nand some other interesting matters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Upper Terrace Garden, Italian Garden, and Lake._]\r\n\r\nThe great features of Trentham are, as we have before said, its grounds\r\nand its matchless lake. To these, however, we have but little space to\r\ndevote, though a bare enumeration of their points of beauty would fill\r\na volume. To the park the public are, thanks to the liberality of the\r\nDuke of Sutherland, and which is one of the innate features of himself\r\nand the noble family of which he is the head, freely admitted. The\r\ngardens and pleasure-grounds (which, until the great alterations made\r\nsome years ago, was simply a sheep pasture railed off from the park)\r\ncan only, however, and very rightly, be seen by special permission.\r\nTo these we must devote a few words. The principal or south front of\r\nthe house—two charming views of which we have given on pages 45 and\r\n46—looks across the grounds and lake to the distant wooded hills\r\nskirting the horizon, and crowned in one place by the colossal statue\r\nof the first duke, to which we have already alluded. A part of this\r\nview, as seen from the windows of this front, we have depicted in\r\nthe accompanying engraving. First comes the Terrace (not included in\r\nour view), studded with statues and vases; next, the Terrace Garden,\r\nwith its central fountain, its grand bronze vases and sculptures,\r\nits flower-beds laid out in the form of a letter S for Sutherland,\r\nits recessed alcoves, and its Grecian temples, containing marvellous\r\nexamples of antique sculpture; next, beyond, come the Italian Gardens\r\n(approached by a fine semicircular flight of steps), about ten acres in\r\nextent, with their parterres and borders and sunk beds, their statues,\r\nfountain, and busts, and their thousand and one other attractions;\r\nthen the Lake Terrace, with its balustrade, its line of vases, its\r\nmagnificent colossal statue of “Perseus and Medusa” (which cost its\r\nnoble owner £1,600), its descending steps for landing, its boat-houses,\r\nand other appliances; then, next beyond, the Lake, eighty-three acres\r\nin extent, on which sailing and rowing boats and canoes find ample\r\nspace for aquatic exercise; then the Islands—one of which alone is\r\nfour acres in extent, and the other a single acre—beautifully planted\r\nwith trees and shrubs; and, beyond this again, the woods of Tittensor,\r\nwith the crowning monument. To the left are the grand wooded heights\r\nof King’s Wood Bank, a part of the ancient forest of Needwood, and\r\nconsequently the remains of the old hunting-grounds of the Kings\r\nof Mercia; and, to the right, the American Grounds, planted with a\r\nprofusion of rhododendrons and other appropriate shrubs and plants;\r\nwhile the Italian Garden is skirted on its east side by a deliciously\r\ncool and shady trellised walk—a floral tunnel, so to speak, some two\r\nhundred yards long, formed of trellised arches the whole of its length,\r\novergrown with creeping plants and flowers, and decorated with busts,\r\nornamental baskets, &c., forming a vista of extreme loveliness.\r\n\r\nNear this is a pleasant glade, having the Orangery, now the Bowling\r\nAlley, at its extremity; and near here is the iron bridge—one hundred\r\nand thirty years old, and one of the _chefs-d’œuvre_ of the old\r\nCoalbrookdale Works—crossing the river Trent, which flows through the\r\ngrounds. Standing on this bridge, the view both up and down the Trent\r\nis strikingly beautiful. Looking up the stream, the “solemn Trent” is\r\nseen crossed by the old stone bridge, while, to the left, a view of\r\nthe house is partially obtained through the trees, the original course\r\nof the river, before it was altered, being distinctly traceable, and\r\npresenting a broader surface and a more graceful sweep than at present.\r\nLooking down the stream, the view is more charming still, and embraces\r\nthe river, the lake (into which, until a few years back, the Trent\r\nflowed), the islands, the American and other gardens, and the wooded\r\nheights that skirt the domain.\r\n\r\nCrossing the bridge, a little to the right is the Conservatory, filled\r\nwith the choicest trees and flowering plants, and kept, as all the rest\r\nof the gardens and grounds are, in the most perfect order. In front of\r\nthis Conservatory is a pretty feature—the poetical idea of the late\r\nduchess—consisting of the names of her daughters (the sisters of the\r\npresent Duke of Sutherland) planted in box on a ground of white spar.\r\nThe words as they appear are—\r\n\r\n  ELIZABETH LORNE.\r\n  EVELYN BLANTYRE.\r\n  CAROLINE KILDARE.\r\n  CONSTANCE GROSVENOR.\r\n  VIRET MEMORIA.\r\n\r\nThus the “memory” of the four daughters of the late duchess—viz. the\r\npresent Duchess of Argyll, the Lady Blantyre, the Duchess of Leinster,\r\nand the Duchess of Westminster—is kept “ever green.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Gardener’s Cottage._]\r\n\r\nNear by are the Kitchen Gardens, Conservatories, Vineries,\r\nPeach-houses, Pine-houses, Orchid-houses, and all the usual appliances\r\nof a large and well-devised establishment; and it is a notable\r\nfeature that all round the Kitchen Gardens, some thirteen acres\r\nin extent, is carried what is known as the Trentham Wall-Case—a\r\nglass-sided and covered passage, filled with peaches and nectarines,\r\nand forming an enclosed walk all round the place. Near the garden\r\nentrance is the pleasant residence of the head-gardener, shown in the\r\npreceding engraving. It was erected from the designs of Sir Charles\r\nBarry; and near it is another excellent building, a “bothie” for\r\nthe young gardeners, erected from the designs of Mr. Roberts, the\r\nDuke’s architect and surveyor at Trentham. In this cottage the young\r\ngardeners, several in number, board and lodge, and have a reading-room,\r\nhealthful and amusing games, and other comforts provided for them. The\r\nChildren’s Cottage, with the grounds around, is also a pretty little\r\nspot, and, indeed, the whole of the grounds are one unbroken succession\r\nof beauties.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Children’s Cottage and Gardens._]\r\n\r\nJust outside the park is the Mausoleum—the burial-place of the\r\nfamily—behind which is the present graveyard of the parish.\r\n\r\nOf the Poultry-houses (the finest in existence), the Stables, the\r\nKennels, and the Estate Offices and Works it is not our province to\r\nspeak. They are all that can be desired in arrangement, and are\r\nlavishly fitted with every convenience.\r\n\r\nWe reluctantly take our leave of Trentham, congratulating alike its\r\nnoble owner on the possession of so lovely an estate, and the Pottery\r\ndistrict in having in its midst a nobleman of such refined taste as his\r\nGrace the Duke of Sutherland, of such liberal and kindly disposition,\r\nand of such boundless wealth, which he has the opportunity of disposing\r\nin an open-hearted and beneficial manner; and this it is his pride to\r\ndo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKNOLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fire Dogs._]\r\n\r\n\r\nKNOLE HOUSE adjoins the pleasant and picturesque town of Sevenoaks, in\r\nthe fertile and beautiful county of Kent—the “garden of England”—and\r\nis situate in its most charming and productive district, neighbouring\r\nthe renowned Wealds, and distant but an hour from the metropolis of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nThe principal approach to the mansion is by a long and winding avenue\r\nof finely grown beech-trees, through the extensive park—the road\r\nsloping and rising gradually, and presenting frequent views of hill and\r\ndale—terminated by the heavy and sombre stone front of the ancient and\r\nvenerable edifice. Passing under an embattled tower, the first or outer\r\nquadrangle is entered; hence there is another passage through another\r\ntower-portal, which conducts to the inner quadrangle, and so to the\r\n\r\n  “Huge hall, long galleries, spacious chambers,”\r\n\r\nfor which Knole has long been famous.\r\n\r\nOf Knole, as with most of our grand old mansions, it is impossible to\r\nfix, with any degree of certainty, the date of its original foundation;\r\n“but the evident connection between the several properties of Knole\r\nand Sevenoaks with Kemsing, Otford, and Seale, coupled with the gifts\r\nof certain lands in Kemsing to the royal abbey at Wilton, appears to\r\nidentify those manors with the _terra regia_ of the Saxon Kings of\r\nKent, who had, it is supposed, one of their palaces at Otford, to which\r\nplace Sevenoaks and Knole have always been esteemed appendant, and were\r\nfor some time after Domesday survey held by the same owners.” Early\r\nin the reign of King John, the manor and estates of Knole, with those\r\nof Braborne (Bradborne), Kemsing, and Seale, were held by Baldwin de\r\nBethun, or Betune, Earl of Albemarle.\r\n\r\nThe first Earl of Albemarle was Odo, Count of Champaigne, a near\r\nrelative by birth to William the Conqueror, and the husband of his\r\nsister, Adeliza. He was succeeded by his son, surnamed _Le Gros_, who\r\nwas also made Earl of Yorkshire. This nobleman appears to have had an\r\nonly child, a daughter named Hawise, who espoused William Mandeville,\r\nEarl of Essex, who, on her father’s death in 1179, succeeded to the\r\ntitle and estates. After his death without issue, his widow, Hawise,\r\nmarried William de Fortibus, who enjoyed the title, as did also her\r\nthird husband, Baldwin de Betune, or Bethun. On his death the earldom\r\nreverted to William de Fortibus, the son of Hawise by her second\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\nIn the fifth year of King John, Baldwin de Betune gave the manors of\r\nKnole, Sevenoaks, Bradborne, Kemsing, and Seale in “frank marriage”\r\nwith his daughter Alice, on her marriage to William Mareschal, Earl\r\nof Pembroke, who was succeeded by his brother, who, being attainted,\r\nthe lands were escheated to the Crown. These manors were next, it is\r\nsaid, given to Fulk de Brent; but he having been banished the realm,\r\nthey again reverted to the Crown, and, the family having returned\r\nto allegiance, the lands were restored to them, and the Earl’s\r\nbrothers—Gilbert, Walter, and Anselme—successively became Earls\r\nof Pembroke and Lords-Marshal. These earls having all died without\r\nissue, the estates “devolved on their sisters, in consequence of\r\nwhich Roger, son of Hugh Bigod, Earl of Norfolk, who married Maud,\r\nthe eldest sister, became entitled, and died seized of these estates\r\nabout 54 Henry III., without issue, leaving Roger Bigod, his nephew,\r\nhis next heir, who, in the 11th of Edward I., conveyed them to Otho\r\nde Grandison, who, dying without issue, was succeeded by his brother,\r\nWilliam de Grandison; and his grandson, Sir Thomas de Grandison,\r\naccording to Philpot, transferred Knole to Geoffrey de Say, and the\r\nrest of the estates to other hands.”\r\n\r\nGeoffrey de Say was summoned to Parliament by Edward III.; was Admiral\r\nof the King’s Fleet, and a knight-banneret; and distinguished himself\r\nin the wars with France and Flanders. He married Maud, daughter of Guy\r\nde Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, by whom he left issue William, his son\r\nand heir, and three daughters, who eventually became co-heiresses “to\r\nthis property, which continued in the family till the reign of Henry\r\nVI., when one Ralph Leghe conveyed the whole estate by sale to James\r\nFiennes,” the grandson of the youngest of the three co-heiresses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Front View from the Park._]\r\n\r\nJames Fiennes, who had distinguished himself in the wars with France\r\nin the reign of Henry V., was created Lord Say and Sele. The Fiennes\r\nwere an ancient family, descended from John, Baron of Fiennes,\r\nHereditary Constable of Dover Castle and Warden of the Cinque Ports,\r\nwho was father of James, and he of John, who had issue Ingelram de\r\nFiennes, who was slain at Acon, in the Holy Land, in 1190. “He married\r\nSybil de Tyngrie, daughter and heiress to Erasmus de Bologne, nephew\r\nto Maud, Queen of England, wife of King Stephen, from which match\r\nproceeded William de Fiennes, who succeeded to the estates of the Earl\r\nof Bologne. He was succeeded by his son Ingelram, whose son William\r\nwas educated with Prince Edward, and was, in turn, succeeded by his\r\nson John, of whom no issue remained. His uncle, Sir Giles Fiennes,\r\nsucceeded. By his wife Sybil he had issue John, his son and heir, and\r\nby Joan, his wife, had issue John de Fiennes, who had to wife Maud,\r\nsister and heir of John Monceaux, of Hurst-Monceaux, in Sussex; and\r\ndying, left issue Sir William Fiennes, Knt., who having married Joan,\r\nyoungest daughter to Geoffrey, Lord Say, and at length co-heir to\r\nWilliam, her brother, his posterity thereby shared in the inheritance\r\nof that family, being succeeded by William, his son and heir.” He\r\nmarried Elizabeth Battisford, by whom he had issue two sons, Roger\r\nand James, the elder of whom left a son, Richard, who, marrying Joan,\r\ndaughter and heiress of Thomas, Lord Dacre, was declared Lord Dacre,\r\nand was ancestor of that noble family.\r\n\r\nJames Fiennes, the second son, of whom we have already spoken as having\r\nbeen called to Parliament as Lord Say and Sele, became Constable of\r\nDover Castle and Warden of the Cinque Ports, Lord Chamberlain to the\r\nKing, Constable of the Tower of London, and Lord Treasurer of England.\r\nSuch rapid advancement was, however, distasteful to the malcontents of\r\nthis kingdom; and the King, to appease them, sequestered Lord Say from\r\nhis office of Treasurer, and, as is supposed, to insure his safety from\r\nhis enemies, committed him to the Tower. The rebels, under Jack Cade,\r\nhowever, forced the Tower, carried Lord Say to the Guildhall, and after\r\na mock trial, hurried him to the Standard in Cheapside, where “they cut\r\noff his head, and carried it on a pole, causing his naked body to be\r\ndrawn at a horse’s tail into Southwark, to Sir Thomas of Waterings, and\r\nthere hanged and quartered.”[41]\r\n\r\nThe murder of Lord Say took place July 4th, 29th Henry VI. He was\r\nsucceeded by his son, Sir William Fiennes (by his wife, Emeline\r\nCromer), who, suffering much in the Wars of the Roses, was compelled to\r\npart with the greater portion of his estates and offices. His patent of\r\nConstable of Dover Castle and Warden of the Cinque Ports he assigned\r\nto Humphrey, Duke of Buckingham, and the manor and estate of Knole he\r\nsold, in 1456, to Thomas Bourchier, Archbishop of Canterbury, for four\r\nhundred marks. After an eventful life he was killed at the battle of\r\nBarnet, and the title died with him. Archbishop Bourchier is said to\r\nhave “rebuilt the manor-house, enclosed a park around the same, and\r\nresided much at it.” At his death, in 1486, he bequeathed the estate to\r\nthe see of Canterbury. Archbishop Morton, who was visited at Knole by\r\nKing Henry VII., died there in 1500; and Archbishop Wareham, who was\r\nfrequently visited at Knole by Kings Henry VII. and VIII., also died\r\nthere. Archbishop Cranmer likewise resided here, and he, by indenture\r\ndated November 30th, 29 Henry VIII., conveyed Knole and other manors\r\nto the King and his successors, in whose hands it remained until the\r\nreign of Edward VI., when that monarch, in his fourth year, granted it\r\nby letters patent to John Dudley, Earl of Warwick (afterwards Duke of\r\nNorthumberland), on whose attainder and execution, in 1553, it again\r\nreverted to the Crown.\r\n\r\nKnole was next, by Queen Mary, granted to Cardinal Pole, then\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury, for life. By Queen Elizabeth, in the third\r\nyear of her reign, it, with other estates, was granted to Sir Robert\r\nDudley, afterwards Earl of Leicester, but was again surrendered, a few\r\nyears later, into the hands of the Queen, who then granted it to Thomas\r\nSackville, afterwards Lord Buckhurst and Earl of Dorset.\r\n\r\nIt were indeed a long story to tell of all the famous deeds of the\r\nnoble family of Sackville, and one that would take more space than we\r\ncan spare. We therefore pass over the earlier members of the family,\r\nso as to reach the first who owned Knole and its surroundings—Thomas\r\nSackville, Lord Buckhurst. He was the son of Richard Sackville, Lent\r\nReader to Henry VIII. and Treasurer to the Army of that monarch, by his\r\nfirst wife, who was daughter of Sir John Bruges, Lord Mayor of London.\r\nWhen only nineteen years of age he married Cicely, daughter of Sir John\r\nBaker, and held many offices in the realm, being selected by the Queen,\r\n“by her particular choice and liking, to a continual private attendance\r\nupon her own person.” In 1567 he was created Baron Buckhurst. In 1571\r\nhe was sent on a special mission to Charles IX. of France to negotiate\r\nthe proposed marriage of his royal mistress, Queen Elizabeth, with the\r\nDuke of Anjou; and later on he was deputed to convey the sentence of\r\nher doom to Mary, Queen of Scots. In 1587 he went on a mission to the\r\nLow Countries, and figured prominently in almost all the incidents of\r\nthe eventful period in which he lived. After the death of Elizabeth,\r\nLord Buckhurst was created, by James I., Earl of Dorset, and was\r\ncontinued in his office of Lord High Treasurer of England. He died\r\nin 1608. Of his abilities as an author (for he was one of the most\r\nbrilliant of his age) Spenser wrote—\r\n\r\n  “Whose learned muse hath writ her own record\r\n  In golden verse, worthy immortal fame.”\r\n\r\nAnd this opinion is indorsed, not only by his contemporaries, but by\r\npeople of every age since his time. He is chiefly celebrated as the\r\nauthor of the earliest English tragedy in blank verse, _Gordubuc_,\r\nand _The Induction to a Mirrour for Magistrates_, one of the noblest\r\npoems in the language. _Gordubuc_ is praised by Sidney for its “notable\r\nmoralitie,” and the poem is believed to have given rise to the “Faery\r\nQueen.” All contemporaries agree in bearing testimony to the virtues of\r\nthis truly noble man. One of them thus draws his character:—“How many\r\nrare things were in him! Who more loving unto his wife? who more kind\r\nunto his children? who more fast unto his friend? who more moderate\r\nunto his enemy? who more true to his word?”\r\n\r\nThis nobleman was succeeded by his son Robert as second Earl of Dorset,\r\nwho died within a year of attaining to that dignity. He married,\r\nfirst, Margaret, only daughter of Thomas, Duke of Norfolk, and,\r\nsecond, Anne, daughter of Sir George Spencer, and was succeeded by his\r\nsecond son of the first marriage, Richard, as third Earl of Dorset.\r\nThis nobleman—who was notorious for the prodigal magnificence of his\r\nhousehold, and had to sell Knole to a Mr. Smith of Wandsworth—married,\r\ntwo days before his father’s death, the famous Lady Ann Clifford,\r\ndaughter of the Earl of Cumberland. He was succeeded by his brother\r\nEdward Sackville, whose name is notorious in history in the matter of\r\nhis unfortunate and fatal duel with Lord Bruce, of Kinloss. He married\r\nMary, third daughter of Sir George Curzon, of Croxhall, in Derbyshire,\r\n“to whose charge the instruction of the young princess was committed\r\nby the unfortunate Charles, to whom the Earl and Countess continued to\r\nthe last to be most faithfully attached.” He was succeeded by his son\r\nRichard as fifth Earl of Dorset, who married Lady Frances Cranfield,\r\ndaughter of Lionel, Earl of Middlesex, who repurchased Knole of the\r\ntrustees of Henry Smith, and was succeeded, as sixth earl, by his son\r\nCharles, who had previously been created Baron Cranfield, and who\r\nmarried, first, Elizabeth, daughter of Hervey Bagot and widow of the\r\nEarl of Falmouth, and, second, Mary, daughter of James Compton, Earl of\r\nNorthampton, by whom he had a son, Lionel, who succeeded him, and was\r\nadvanced to the dignity of Duke of Dorset, and made Constable of Dover\r\nCastle, Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, Lord High Steward of England,\r\nLord-Lieutenant of Ireland, Lord President of the Council, and held\r\nmany other offices, and took an active part in all affairs of the State.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The South Front._]\r\n\r\nHe was succeeded, as second Duke of Dorset, by his son Charles, who,\r\namong his other offices, held that of Master of the Horse to Frederick,\r\nPrince of Wales. He married Grace, daughter of Viscount Shannon, who\r\nwas Mistress of the Robes to Augusta, Princess of Wales, but had no\r\nissue. He was succeeded in 1769 by his nephew, John Frederick, as\r\nthird duke. He married, in 1790, Arabella Diana, daughter and heiress\r\nof Sir John Cope, by whom he had issue George John Frederick (who\r\nsucceeded him as fourth duke); Mary, married to the Earl of Plymouth;\r\nand Elizabeth, married to Earl Delawarr. The third duke died in 1799,\r\nhis only son being at that time in his sixth year. The Duchess, who\r\nmarried, secondly, Lord Whitworth, resided at Knole till her death\r\nin 1825; the fourth duke, her son, who had only three months before\r\nattained his majority, being killed by a fall from his horse in 1815.\r\nAt his death Knole and some other estates passed to his sister and\r\nco-heiress, the Lady Mary Sackville, who married first, in 1811, Other\r\nArcher, sixth Earl of Plymouth, and, second, William Pitt, second Baron\r\nand first Earl Amherst, but had no issue by either of those marriages.\r\nHer ladyship died in 1864, and the estates then passed to her sister\r\nand co-heiress, the Lady Elizabeth Sackville, created in 1864 the\r\nBaroness Buckhurst, wife of the late George John Sackville-West, fifth\r\nEarl Delawarr, with remainder to her second and younger sons, and was\r\nmother of the late peer, Charles Richard, sixth Earl Delawarr; the\r\npresent peer, the Right Hon. Reginald Windsor Sackville-West, seventh\r\nEarl Delawarr and Baron Buckhurst; the Hon. Mortimer Sackville-West,\r\nmarried to Charlotte, daughter of Major-General William Dickson, and\r\nis a claimant for the barony of Buckhurst, the present owner of Knole;\r\nthe Hon. Lionel Sackville-West; the Hon. William Edward Sackville-West,\r\nmarried to Georgiana, daughter of George Dodwell, Esq.; the Lady\r\nElizabeth, married to the present Duke of Bedford; the Lady Mary\r\nCatherine, married first, in 1847, to the second Marquis of Salisbury,\r\nand second, in 1870, to the fifteenth (present) Earl of Derby; and the\r\nLady Arabella Diana, married to Sir Alexander Bannerman, Bart.\r\n\r\nThe sixth Earl of Delawarr, Charles Richard Sackville-West, C.B., was\r\nborn in 1815, and succeeded his father in 1869; educated at Harrow,\r\nand entered the 43rd Foot, 1833; Captain 21st Fusiliers, 1842; Major\r\nin the army, 1846; Brevet-Colonel, 1850; Lieut.-Colonel and Colonel,\r\n1854; Major-General, 1864. His lordship, as Lord West, served in the\r\nSutlej campaign, 1845; was Aide-de-camp to Lord Gough at the battles\r\nof Moodkee and Ferozeshah, and Military Secretary during the remainder\r\nof the campaign; was present at Sobraon, and has received medal and\r\nclasps; served in the Crimea, including the battles of the Alma and\r\nBalaclava; commanded a detached wing of the 21st Fusiliers at the\r\nbattle of Inkermann, and also that regiment at Sebastopol. In the\r\nexpedition to Kinbourn he was in command of a brigade, and afterwards\r\ncommanded one at Shorncliffe Camp. His lordship was an Officer of the\r\nLegion of Honour, a Knight of the Medjidie, &c.\r\n\r\nHis lordship, who was unmarried, died, by his own hand, April 23rd,\r\n1873, and was succeeded by his brother, the Hon. and Rev. R. W.\r\nSackville.\r\n\r\nThe present noble peer, the Hon. and Rev. Reginald Windsor Sackville,\r\nseventh Earl Delawarr, Viscount Cantelupe, Baron Delawarr, Baron\r\nWest, and Baron Buckhurst, second son of the fifth Earl Delawarr, and\r\nbrother of the sixth earl, was born in 1817; was educated at Balliol\r\nCollege, Oxford, where he proceeded B.A. in 1838, and M.A. in 1842;\r\nand became Rector of Withyham, in Sussex. He assumed, in 1871, the\r\nsurname of Sackville only, in lieu of that of Sackville-West. His\r\nlordship married, in 1867, Constance Mary Elizabeth, daughter of A. D.\r\nR. W. Baillie-Cochrane, Esq., M.P., by whom he has issue living, the\r\nHon. Lionel Charles Cranfield Sackville, Viscount Cantelupe, born in\r\n1868; the Hon. Gilbert George Reginald Sackville, born in 1869; the\r\nHon. Edeline Sackville, born in 1870; and the Hon. Leonore Mary, born\r\nin 1872. His lordship is patron of six livings, four of which are in\r\nSussex and two in Oxfordshire.\r\n\r\nThe arms of Earl Delawarr are—quarterly, _or_ and _gules_, a bend\r\nvaire, _argent_ and _azure_. Crest—on a ducal coronet composed of\r\nfleurs-de-lis, as estoile, _argent_, supporters on either side,\r\na leopard, _argent_, spotted _sable_. Motto—“Nunquam tentes aut\r\nperfice.” His seats are—Buckhurst, Tunbridge Wells; and Bourn Hall,\r\nCambridge.\r\n\r\nThe present owner of Knole is the Hon. Mortimer Sackville-West, son\r\nof the fifth and brother of the sixth and seventh (present) Earl\r\nDelawarr, to whom it passed on the demise of his mother, the Baroness\r\nBuckhurst, to which title, now assumed by Earl Delawarr, he is a\r\nclaimant. Mr. Sackville-West, who was born in 1820, became Captain\r\nGrenadier Guards in 1845, and is a Groom in Waiting in Ordinary to her\r\nMajesty. He married first, in 1847, Fanny Charlotte, daughter of the\r\nlate Major-General William Dickson, C.B., E.I.C.S., of Beenham House,\r\nBerkshire, who died in 1870; and second, in 1873, Elizabeth, second\r\ndaughter of Charles Wilson Faber, Esq.\r\n\r\nKnole House is full of highly honourable and deeply interesting\r\nassociations with the past. Seen from a distance, the mansion appears\r\nirregular; but, although the erection of several periods, and enlarged\r\nfrom time to time to meet the wants and wishes of its immediate\r\noccupiers, it exhibits few parts out of harmony with the whole, and\r\npresents a striking and very imposing example of the earlier Baronial\r\nMansion, such as it was before settled peace in Britain warranted\r\nthe withdrawal of all means of defence in cases of attack from open\r\nor covert enemies. The neighbourhood, as well as “the house,” is\r\nsuggestive of many sad or pleasant memories. From the summits of\r\nknolls, in the noble and well-stocked park, extensive views are\r\nobtained of the adjacent country. Scattered about the wealds of Kent\r\nare the tall spires of scores of village churches: Hever—recalling\r\nthe fate of the murdered Anne Boleyn and the destiny of the deserted\r\nAnne of Cleves; Penshurst—the cradle and the tomb of the Sidneys;\r\nEridge—once great Warwick’s hunting-seat; the still frowning\r\nbattlements of Tunbridge Castle; these and other subjects within ken\r\ndemand thought and induce reflection, both of which obtain augmented\r\npower while treading the graceful corridors and stately chambers of the\r\ntime-honoured mansion. The walls are hung with authentic portraits of\r\nthe great men of various epochs who, when living, flourished here; not\r\nalone the noble and wealthy owners of the old hall, but the worthies\r\nwho sojourned there as guests, to have sheltered, aided, and befriended\r\nwhom is now the proudest, as it will be the most enduring, of all the\r\nboasts of lordly Knole.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Knole, from the Garden._]\r\n\r\nVisitors are generously admitted into the more interesting and\r\nattractive of the apartments; and they are full of treasures of\r\nArt—not of paintings alone, although of these every chamber is\r\na storehouse, but of curious and rare productions, from the most\r\nelaborate and costly examples of the artists of the Middle Ages, to\r\nthe characteristic works of the English artisan during the reigns of\r\nElizabeth and James, when a vast amount of labour was bestowed upon the\r\ncommonest articles of every-day use.\r\n\r\nIn the Porter’s Apartments, adjoining the entrance, is what may be\r\ncalled the Retainers’ Armoury—an apartment lined with old flint and\r\nsteel muskets of formidable bore, cutlasses, skull-caps, and other\r\nwarlike implements, including some fine halberds. It is said that\r\nCromwell, on taking Knole House, carried away several waggon-loads\r\nof arms. Even now the position is so strong, that a garrison of five\r\nhundred men, loopholing the walls, and taking the defensive measures\r\nprescribed by the military science of the day, would be able to make\r\nit a “tough job” to turn them out. The curious brick loopholing of the\r\nwall of a large building, looking like a barn, at the north-east corner\r\nof the pile, seems as if it had been prepared for the use of archers.\r\nIn a court-yard near, the wall has been raised, and that at a period\r\nwhich is widely removed from the date of its erection. In the lower and\r\nthicker portion is a window of the style introduced in the reign of\r\nHenry III. Close by, in the upper and receding portion, is an opening\r\nwith the flat, four-centred arch of the Tudor times.\r\n\r\nThe first court entered by the visitor is the Green Court, in which are\r\nthe famous figures of the “Gladiator,” and of “Venus rising from the\r\nBath.” Around this court are Lord John’s Apartments, the Greenhouse,\r\nthe Bishop’s Stables, and various offices. The next court is known as\r\nthe Stone Court, from which Knole House itself is entered. From the\r\nGreat Hall a fine old staircase leads to the Brown Gallery.\r\n\r\nThe Brown Gallery is oak-panelled, and contains a large number of\r\nportraits—copies, principally, in one style, apparently by one hand,\r\nand in similar frames: they are chiefly of the worthies of the age\r\nof Elizabeth and James, and form a series of much interest. In this\r\ngallery, also, are many of those “easy-chairs” of the same epoch, for\r\nwhich the house at Knole has long been famous, and which have been\r\nso valuable to artists. It is a long and narrow apartment, panelled,\r\nroofed, and floored with oak. Here the antique fastenings to the doors\r\nand windows are preserved in their early purity; the stained windows\r\nare fresh, as if painted yesterday; while the historic portraits give\r\nvitality to the striking and interesting scene, and seem to remove two\r\ncenturies from between the present and the past.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Brown Gallery._]\r\n\r\nFrom the Brown Gallery a passage leads to the Chapel, fitted up with\r\ntapestry, with stained-glass windows, and the other accessories of a\r\nplace of worship. The Chapel is of stately proportions, and flooded\r\nwith a golden light, admitted through the eastern window, which is full\r\nof old yellow stained glass. It is kept in perfect order for daily\r\nservice; but the appearance of English texts, written in that imitation\r\nof old English which has lately become prevalent, seems to jar with the\r\ntraditional Catholicity of the spot. The private gallery is, in fact,\r\na large room, in which the members of the family can be present at the\r\nworship, unseen by the servants or any other attendants. The gallery is\r\nhung with some very fine tapestry, of a bold style of execution, and in\r\nexcellent preservation. The subject is not explained by the tradition\r\nof the spot. It appears to refer to the legend of St. Veronica, as the\r\nmarvellous _sudarium_, or handkerchief, bearing the impression of the\r\nfeatures of Christ, is displayed in one scene, to the astonishment of\r\na truculent personage in an enormous crown, who appears repeatedly in\r\nvarious parts of the canvas, and no doubt represents “the Emperor”—a\r\ntitle of singular elasticity in monkish stories. The Chapel is directly\r\nconnected with the home chambers of the family: these are hung with\r\nrare pictures by the great old masters, filled with objects of _virtu_\r\ngathered in various countries by several members of the race, and\r\ndistributed with judgment and taste.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the Brown Gallery are Lady Betty Germaine’s\r\nBed-room and Dressing-room: here, also, are fire-dogs, cabinets, and\r\neasy-chairs, that time has made picturesque. Lady Betty Germaine, from\r\nwhom this room is named, was a great patroness of literature and the\r\nArts. She was daughter of the Earl of Berkeley, and second wife to Sir\r\nJohn Germaine. Dying without issue, she left, as did her husband, an\r\nimmense property to her nephew, Lord George Sackville, who assumed the\r\nname of Germaine. After his disgrace for alleged military incompetency\r\nin the reign of George II., he was loaded with honours by George III.,\r\nand by him created Viscount Sackville and Baron Bolebrooke. Lady Betty,\r\nby her will, bequeathed to Lady Vere £20,000; to Lord George Sackville\r\n£20,000, and Drayton House and estate; and, after other legacies, left\r\nthe residue of her property to be equally divided between them. Here,\r\ntoo, is the Spangled Bed-room, which owes its name to the character\r\nof its draperies. The Billiard-room is then reached, and then the\r\nLeicester Gallery, the most interesting of the whole range: it is\r\nfull of portraits of the highest merit by great masters—that of the\r\npoet-Earl of Surrey being among its chief attractions. Leading from\r\nthis gallery is the Venetian Bed-room with its Dressing-room; between\r\nthem hangs a portrait of the Venetian ambassador, who gave the gallery\r\nits name—Nicolo Molino. The looking-glass in this apartment repays\r\ncareful attention. It is framed in ebony, banded with silver; and in\r\nthis and similar articles of furniture the examples afforded of a free,\r\nbold style of silver-work, English in its character, and eminently\r\nadapted to show to advantage the lustrous surface of the noble metal,\r\nare very striking. In some of the vases and sconces, of which copies\r\nare now to be seen at South Kensington, the same class of workmanship\r\nmay be studied.\r\n\r\nLovers of heraldic antiquity will look with respectful affection at the\r\npedigree of the noble family, a ponderous roll of parchment, fixed in\r\na frame, as on the roller of a blind, so that it can be drawn out for\r\nconsultation. The arms blazoned on the portion visible are those borne\r\nin 1586. Close by is a second roll of equal length, but of narrower\r\nwidth, which appears to contain drawings of tombs and monuments, and\r\ncopies of painted windows, illustrative of the pedigree.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Cartoon Gallery._]\r\n\r\nThe Cartoon Gallery—so called as containing copies in oil by Mytens\r\nof six of the cartoons of Raffaelle—is also full of historic\r\nportraits. In this room are some remarkably fine fire-dogs. Two of\r\nthese interesting objects from the Cartoon Gallery are engraved on our\r\ninitial letter on page 56.\r\n\r\nThe King’s Room, the room in which it is said, though without any\r\ndirect evidence, that James I. slept when a guest at Knole, is lined\r\nwith tapestry detailing the story of Nebuchadnezzar; the hangings of\r\nthe bed are thickly “inlaid” with silver—it is tissue of the costliest\r\nkind; a mirror of silver, an Art specimen of the rarest order; the\r\nvarious articles of the toilet in the same metal; two marvellous ebony\r\ncabinets; and other objects of great worth, account for the expenditure\r\nsaid to have been incidental to the visit of the sovereign: it is added\r\nthat as they were there placed and arranged in the first years of the\r\nseventeenth century they have remained ever since. It is probable that\r\nthe furniture of this room is what was prepared for the King at the\r\ngrand reception given to him at Oxford by the Duke, and afterwards\r\nbrought to Knole. Knole has not, however, been without its royal\r\nvisitors, as we have already stated: among them were Henry VII., Henry\r\nVIII., and Queen Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The King’s Bed-room._]\r\n\r\nThe Dining-room contains the portraits of men made famous by genius\r\nrather than rank. Here are Shakspere, Beaumont, Fletcher, Chaucer,\r\nCongreve, Gay, Rowe, Garth, Cowley, Swift, Otway, Pope, Milton,\r\nAddison, Waller, Dryden, Hobbes, Newton, Locke (the six last named by\r\nKneller), Goldsmith, Dr. Johnson, Garrick (marvellous paintings by Sir\r\nJoshua Reynolds), Walter Scott, and other heroes of the pen, many of\r\nwhom were honoured visitors at Knole during their lives, and have been\r\nreverenced there since they left earth.\r\n\r\nThe Staircase at the Grand Entrance is singular and interesting: parts\r\nof it are old, but the decorative portions are of a modern, and not of\r\na good character.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Staircase._]\r\n\r\nThe Crimson Drawing-room contains pictures by Reynolds, Wouvermans,\r\nParmigiano, Vandyke, Holbein, Lely, the Carracci, Titian, Berghem, and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe Retainers’ Gallery, a gallery that runs the whole length of the\r\nhouse, is on the topmost floor. From its peculiarly picturesque\r\ncharacter it has been drawn or painted by nearly every artist whose\r\npencil has found work at Knole: we engrave one portion of it.\r\n\r\nThe collection of fire-dogs at Knole is singularly rich; they adorn\r\nevery room throughout the mansion, the greater number being of chased\r\nsilver. The chairs and seats of various kinds, to be seen in all parts\r\nof the house, are, as we have intimated, so many models for the artist.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Retainers’ Gallery._]\r\n\r\nThe Great Hall has its dais, its Minstrels’ Gallery, and even\r\nits oak tables, where retainers feasted long ago. In a window of\r\nthe Billiard-room is a painting on glass of a knight in armour,\r\nrepresenting the famous ancestor of the Sackvilles; and in the Cartoon\r\nGallery are, also on glass, the armorial bearings of twenty-one of his\r\ndescendants, ending with Richard, the third Earl of Dorset. Of the\r\nseveral Galleries and the Drawing-rooms it is sufficient to state that\r\nthey are magnificent in reference to their contents, and beautiful as\r\nregards the style of decoration accorded to each. There is, indeed, no\r\npart of the building which may not afford exquisite and useful models\r\nto the painter—a fact of which the noble owners are fully aware, for\r\nto artists they have afforded repeated facilities for study. It will\r\nnot be difficult to recognise, in some of the best productions of\r\nmodern art, copies of the gems which give value and adornment to the\r\nnoble House of Knole.\r\n\r\nThe beeches of Knole have long been famous: they are of magnificent\r\ngrowth, gnarled by time into picturesque forms, sometimes singly, here\r\nand there in groups, and occasionally in long and gracefully arched\r\navenues: of the latter is the Duchess’s Walk. The gardens, too, are\r\nlaid out with much taste. The park is, indeed, one of the grandest and\r\nmost striking, if not the most extensive, in the kingdom.\r\n\r\nThere is not a gallery, not a room, that does not teach to the present\r\nand the future the lessons that are to be learned from the past. Every\r\nstep has its reminder of the great men who have flourished in times\r\ngone by, to leave their impress on their “hereafter”—\r\n\r\n  “Footprints on the sands of time.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCASTLE HOWARD.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS princely seat of the Howards is distant about twenty miles from\r\nthe venerable city of York, on the road from thence to Malton. The\r\nrailway station, four miles from the mansion, on the borders of the\r\nDerwent, and not far from one of the most interesting of monastic\r\nruins, the ancient abbey of Kirkham, is pretty and picturesque, and the\r\ndrive from thence to the castle is by a road full of beauty—passing\r\nby tranquil villages and umbrageous woods, and commanding, here and\r\nthere, glorious and extensive views of fertile country, far away from\r\nthe active bustle of busy life. Castle Howard, one of the most perfect\r\nof the “dwellings” that succeeded the castles and “strong houses” of\r\nour forefathers, with its gardens, grounds, lawns, plantations, woods,\r\nand all the accessories of refined taste, is a model of that repose\r\nwhich speaks of happiness—and makes it; and it is pleasant to imagine\r\nthere the good statesman, retiring from the political warfare in which\r\nhe had so large a share, to leave earth, “after life’s fitful fever,”\r\nin the midst of the graces of the demesne, and the honourable and lofty\r\nassociations connected with a numerous list of heroic ancestors.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Carlisle, the owner of Castle Howard, is descended from\r\na long line of noble and distinguished men whose services to their\r\nsovereigns and their country gained for them the highest honours and\r\ndistinctions; yet the parts they took in the troublous times in which\r\nthey lived brought no less than three of their brightest ornaments to\r\nthe block under charges of high treason.\r\n\r\nThe House of Howard, although not of the oldest of English families, is\r\none that claims precedence of rank over all others; for its head, the\r\nDuke of Norfolk, is Premier Duke and Earl, Hereditary Earl Marshal, and\r\nChief Butler of England, and has, therefore, extraordinary importance\r\nattached to it.\r\n\r\nThis great historical House can only with certainty be traced to Sir\r\nWilliam Howard, Judge of Common Pleas in the year 1297, although\r\nplausible, and indeed highly probable, connections have been made\r\nout to a much earlier period. They inherit much of their Norfolk\r\nproperty from their ancestors, the Bigods. In the fourteenth century,\r\nby the match of the then head of the family, Sir Robert Howard, with\r\nthe heiress of Thomas de Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk, the foundation of\r\nthe splendour and consequence of the Howards was laid. That lady was\r\nMargaret, eldest daughter of the Duke of Norfolk by his wife Elizabeth,\r\ndaughter and co-heiress of Richard, Earl of Arundel. The said Thomas de\r\nMowbray, Duke of Norfolk, was son and heir to John, Lord Mowbray, by\r\nElizabeth, his wife, daughter and heiress to John, Lord Segrave, and\r\nMargaret, his wife, daughter and heiress of Thomas de Brotherton, Earl\r\nof Norfolk and Earl Marshal of England, the eldest son of King Edward\r\nI., by his second wife Margaret, daughter to Philip the Hardy, King of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nBy this splendid alliance Sir Robert Howard had an only son and two\r\ndaughters. The son, Sir John Howard, was created Lord Howard, and\r\nafterwards Duke of Norfolk, and had the highest offices bestowed\r\non him—a title and honours which have (excepting the periods of\r\nsequestration) remained in the family ever since.\r\n\r\nAll the present English peers of the noble House of Howard descend from\r\na common ancestor in Thomas, the second Duke of Norfolk of the name\r\nof Howard, who died in 1524. Thus the Duke of Norfolk, the Earl of\r\nSuffolk, and the Earl of Carlisle are descended from his first wife,\r\nMary, daughter and heiress to Henry Fitzalan, Earl of Arundel; and the\r\nEarl of Effingham from his second wife, Margaret, daughter and heiress\r\nof Thomas, Lord Audley of Walden, and widow of Lord Henry Dudley, son\r\nof the Duke of Northumberland. The Howards of Greystoke, in Cumberland,\r\nare a younger branch of the present ducal House, as are the Howards\r\nof Glossop, &c. The Howards of Corby Castle descend from the Carlisle\r\nbranch, tracing from “Belted Will Howard.” The titles and dignities\r\nnow enjoyed by different members of the family of Howard are—Duke of\r\nNorfolk, Earl Marshal, and Hereditary Marshal of England; Premier Duke\r\nand Earl next to the royal blood; Earl of Norfolk, Earl of Surrey, Earl\r\nof Arundel, Baron Fitzalan, Baron Clun, Baron Oswaldestre, and Baron\r\nMaltravers; Earl of Suffolk, Earl of Berkshire, Viscount Andover, and\r\nBaron Howard; Earl of Carlisle, Viscount Howard of Morpeth (generally\r\ncalled Viscount Morpeth), and Baron Dacre of Gillesland; Earl of\r\nEffingham, Viscount Howard of Effingham, and Baron Howard of Effingham;\r\nBaron Howard of Glossop; Baron Lanerton of Naworth; Earl of Wicklow,\r\nViscount Wicklow, and Baron Clonmore.\r\n\r\nThe earldom of Carlisle was originally enjoyed by Ranulph de Meschines,\r\nnephew of Hugh Lupus, Earl of Chester. The earldom appears next to\r\nhave been given to Andrew de Harcla, who was son of Michael de Harcla,\r\nGovernor of Carlisle, who afterwards “being condemned for a traytor, he\r\nwas at first in form degraded, having his knightly spurs hew’d off from\r\nhis heels; and at last hang’d, drawn, and quartered, 3rd March, 1322.”\r\n\r\nThe title was next enjoyed by the Plantagenets, and thus again merged\r\ninto the Crown. In 1620, the title—with those of Viscount Doncaster\r\nand Baron Hay—was conferred on Sir James Hay: he was succeeded by his\r\nson James, who died without issue. The title thus again became extinct,\r\nand so remained until it was conferred on the Howards.\r\n\r\nLord William Howard—third son of the Duke of Norfolk, already spoken\r\nof—was the “Belted Will Howard” of history, one of the leading heroes\r\nof Border minstrelsy—the hero of whom Sir Walter Scott writes—\r\n\r\n  “Costly his garb—his Flemish ruff\r\n  Fell o’er his doublet, shaped of buff,\r\n    With satin slashed and lined;\r\n  Tawny his boot, and gold his spur,\r\n  His cloak was all of Poland fur,\r\n    His hose with silver twined;\r\n  His Bilboa blade, by Marchmen felt,\r\n  Hung in a broad and studded belt;—\r\n  Hence, in rude phrase, the Borderers still\r\n  Called noble Howard ‘BELTED WILL.’”\r\n\r\nHe was, as we have stated, the third son of the fourth Duke of Norfolk,\r\nand grandson of the famous Earl of Surrey:—\r\n\r\n  “Who has not heard of Surrey’s fame?”\r\n\r\nHis father lost his title, his estates, and his head on Tower Hill, and\r\nbequeathed him to the care of his elder brother, as “having nothing\r\nto feed the cormorants withal.” He was married, in 1577, to the Lady\r\nElizabeth Dacre, daughter of Thomas, and sister and co-heiress of\r\nGeorge, Lord Dacre of Gillesland, the ages of both together being\r\nshort of eight-and-twenty—he being fourteen years old, and she a few\r\nmonths younger. During the whole of the reign of Elizabeth, however,\r\nhe and his brother Arundel, and several other members of his family,\r\nwere greatly oppressed—subjected repeatedly to charges of treason, and\r\nkept in a state of poverty, “very grievous to bear.” On the accession\r\nof James I. their prospects brightened; Lord William was received into\r\nspecial favour, and, in 1605, was appointed to the perilous post of\r\nKing’s Lieutenant and Lord Warden of the Marches, when the northern\r\nshires of England were exposed to perpetual inroads of Border caterans.\r\nThe onerous and very difficult duties imposed upon him he discharged\r\nwith equal fearlessness and severity. His boast was so to act that the\r\nrush-bush should guard the cow; so that, to quote “quaint old Fuller,”\r\n“when in their greatest height, the moss-troopers had two fierce\r\nenemies—the laws of the land, and Lord William Howard, who sent many\r\nof them to Carlisle, that place where the officer does his work by\r\ndaylight.”\r\n\r\nAlthough formidable to his enemies, Lord William Howard was fervent\r\nand faithful to his friends. His attachment to his lady was of the\r\n“truest affection, esteem, and friendship;” and his love of letters\r\nand the refined pursuits of leisure and ease rendered him conspicuous\r\neven among the many intellectual men of the period. He was the friend\r\nof Camden and other men of note. For Camden he copied the inscriptions\r\non the Roman remains in his district; and he collected together a fine\r\nlibrary of the best authors (part of which still exists), and, in\r\naddition, he himself edited the “Chronicle of Florence of Worcester.”\r\nHe collected a number of valuable MSS., which now form a part of the\r\nArundel Collection in the British Museum. An excellent portrait of\r\nthis great man, of whom the Howards may well feel proud, is preserved\r\nat Castle Howard. His dress is a close jacket of thick black figured\r\nsilk, with rounded skirts to mid-thigh, and many small buttons. The\r\nrest of his dress is also of black silk. His sleeves are turned up,\r\nand he has a deep white falling collar. He wears a dress rapier, and\r\nis bareheaded. The dress in which he is painted is, curiously enough,\r\nascertained, from the steward’s accounts of the time, to have cost £17\r\n7_s._ 6_d._ There is also a portrait by the same artist (Cornelius\r\nJansen) of the Lady Elizabeth, his wife. To the courage of the soldier\r\n“Belted Will” added the courtesy of the scholar, and, although the\r\n“tamer of the wild border” has been pictured as a ferocious man-slayer,\r\nhistory does him but justice in describing him as a model of chivalry,\r\nwhen chivalry was the leading characteristic of the age. He died in\r\n1640, surviving the Lady Bessy—“Bessie with the braid apron”—only\r\none year, their union having continued during sixty-three years, and\r\nleaving by her ten sons and five daughters, the eldest of the sons\r\nbeing the direct ancestor of the Earls of Carlisle. Their sons and\r\ndaughters, with their wives and husbands and children, are said,\r\nall at one time, to have lived with them; the family numbering\r\nfifty-two persons. The sobriquet of “Belted Will” was “not, it is\r\nunderstood, derived from the breadth of the baldric, a broad belt,\r\nthe distinguishing badge of high station, but rather meant ‘bauld,’\r\nor bold, Willie; and that the term ‘Bessie with the braid apron’ did\r\nnot refer to that portion of a lady’s dress, but to the _breadth_, or\r\nextent, of her possessions.”\r\n\r\nTheir eldest son, Sir Philip Howard, died in his father’s lifetime,\r\nleaving by his wife Margaret, daughter of Sir John Carryl, a son, Sir\r\nWilliam Howard, who succeeded his grandfather, Lord William, in the\r\nenjoyment of his estates. He married Mary, eldest daughter of William,\r\nLord Eure, by whom he had issue five sons—William (who died in the\r\nlifetime of his father), Charles, Philip, Thomas, and John—and five\r\ndaughters. He was succeeded by his second son, Charles, who, for\r\nmany loyal services to his king, was, in 1661, created Baron Dacre\r\nof Gillesland, Viscount Howard of Morpeth, and Earl of Carlisle. He\r\nalso enjoyed many high appointments and privileges. He married Anne,\r\ndaughter of Edward, Lord Howard of Escrick, and had issue by her two\r\nsons, Edward and Frederick Christian, and three daughters. Dying in\r\n1684, his lordship was succeeded by his eldest son, Edward Howard.\r\n\r\nEdward, second Earl of Carlisle, married Elizabeth, daughter of Sir\r\nWilliam Berkeley, by whom he had issue three sons and two daughters.\r\nHis lordship died in 1692, and was succeeded by his only surviving son,\r\nCharles, as third earl, who, during the minority of his kinsman, the\r\nDuke of Norfolk, held the office of Deputy Earl Marshal: many important\r\nposts were conferred upon, and trusts reposed in, him. He married Lady\r\nElizabeth Capel, daughter of the Earl of Essex, by whom he left issue\r\ntwo sons—Henry, who succeeded him, and Charles, a general of the\r\narmy—and three daughters.\r\n\r\nHenry, who succeeded his father, in 1738, as fourth Earl of Carlisle,\r\nmarried, first, Lady Frances Spencer, only daughter of Charles, Earl of\r\nSunderland, by whom he had issue three sons, who predeceased him, and\r\ntwo daughters; and, secondly, in 1743, Isabella, daughter of William,\r\nfourth Lord Byron, by whom he left issue one son—Frederick, who\r\nsucceeded him—and four daughters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The South Front._]\r\n\r\nFrederick, fifth Earl of Carlisle, succeeded his father in the title\r\nand estates in 1758, being at the time only ten years of age. In\r\n1768 he was made a Knight of the Thistle, and in 1793 installed as\r\nK.G. His lordship, who was a man of letters and of high intellectual\r\nattainments, in 1801 published “The Tragedies and Poems of Frederick,\r\nEarl of Carlisle, K.G.” This lord was the guardian of Lord Byron, and\r\nto him the “Hours of Idleness” was dedicated. Some severe and satiric\r\npassages concerning the Earl may be called to mind in “English Bards\r\nand Scotch Reviewers”—passages which the erratic poet afterwards\r\nregretted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Garden Front._]\r\n\r\nHe married the Lady Margaret Caroline Leveson-Gower, daughter of\r\nGranville, first Marquis of Stafford, by whom he had issue—the Hon.\r\nGeorge, Viscount Morpeth; Lady Isabella Caroline, who was married,\r\nfirst, to Lord Cawdor, and, secondly, to the Hon. Captain George Pryse;\r\nLady Charlotte; Lady Susan Maria; Lady Louisa; Lady Elizabeth, who\r\nmarried John Henry, Duke of Rutland, and was mother of the present\r\nDuke of Rutland, of Lord John Manners, and a numerous family;[42] the\r\nHon. William Howard, who died unmarried; Lady Gertrude, who married\r\nWilliam Sloane Stanley, Esq.; Major the Hon. Frederick Howard, who\r\nmarried Frances Susan Lambton, sister to the Earl of Durham (he was\r\nkilled at the battle of Waterloo), who married, secondly, the Hon. H.\r\nF. C. Cavendish, second son of the Earl of Burlington; and the Hon. and\r\nVery Rev. Henry Edward John Howard, Dean of Lichfield, &c., who married\r\nHenrietta Elizabeth, daughter of Ichabod Wright, Esq. His lordship died\r\nin 1825, and was succeeded by his son—\r\n\r\nGeorge, Viscount Morpeth, as sixth Earl of Carlisle, who filled many\r\nimportant offices. He married the Lady Georgiana Dorothy Cavendish,\r\ndaughter of William, fifth Duke of Devonshire, and sister to the late\r\nduke, and by her had issue—George William Frederick, Lord Morpeth\r\n(who succeeded his father); Lady Caroline Georgiana, married to the\r\nHon. William Saunders Sebright Lascelles, brother to the Earl of\r\nHarewood; Lady Georgiana, married to Lord Dover; the Hon. Frederick\r\nGeorge; Lady Harriet Elizabeth Georgiana, married to the Duke of\r\nSutherland, and mother to the present illustrious nobleman of that\r\ntitle;[43] the Hon. and Rev. William George Howard (the present peer);\r\nthe Hon. Edward Granville George, Baron Lanerton, married to Diana,\r\nniece of Lord Ponsonby; Lady Blanche Georgiana, married to William\r\nCavendish, afterwards second Earl of Burlington, and now the present\r\nhighly esteemed and illustrious Duke of Devonshire, by whom she had\r\nissue—the present Marquis of Hartington, M.P., Lord Frederick Charles\r\nCavendish, M.P., Lord Edward Cavendish, M.P., and Lady Louisa Cavendish\r\n(Egerton); the Hon. Charles Wentworth George Howard, M.P., married to\r\nMary, daughter of Judge Parke; Lady Elizabeth Anne Georgiana Dorothea,\r\nmarried to the Hon. and Rev. F. R. Grey, brother to Earl Grey; the Hon.\r\nHenry George Howard, married to a niece of the Marchioness Wellesley;\r\nand Lady Mary Matilda, married to the Right Hon. Henry Labouchere,\r\nBaron Taunton. His lordship, who died in 1848, was succeeded by his\r\nson—\r\n\r\nGeorge William Frederick, Viscount Morpeth, as seventh earl, one of\r\nthe most distinguished men of the age in literature and science, as\r\nwell as in the senate. His lordship, as Lord Morpeth, took a prominent\r\npart in the political affairs of the kingdom, and among the important\r\noffices he held, at one time or other in his useful life, were those of\r\nLord-Lieutenant of Ireland, Chief Commissioner of Woods and Forests,\r\nand Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. He was a man of the most\r\nrefined taste and of the highest intellectual culture, and his writings\r\nwere of a rare order of merit. He died unmarried in 1864, and was\r\nsucceeded by his brother—\r\n\r\nThe present noble peer, the Hon. and Rev. William George Howard,\r\neighth Earl of Carlisle, Viscount Howard of Morpeth, and Baron Dacre\r\nof Gillesland, in the titles and estates. His lordship was born in\r\n1808, and was educated at Eton and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he\r\ntook honours, and proceeded M.A. in 1840. In 1832 he was appointed\r\nto the rectory of Londesborough, which living he held until 1866. He\r\nis senior co-heir to the barony of Clifford, and is unmarried, the\r\nheir-presumptive to the earldom being his brother, Admiral the Hon.\r\nEdward Granville George Howard, R.N., Lord Lanerton. His lordship is\r\npatron of five livings—viz. Brampton, Farlam, and Lanercost Abbey, in\r\nCumberland; Slingsby, in Yorkshire; and Morpeth, in Northumberland.\r\n\r\nThe arms of the Earl of Carlisle are—quarterly of six: 1st, _gules_,\r\na bend between six cross crosslets fitchée, _argent_, on the bend an\r\nescutcheon, _or_, charged with a demi-lion, pierced through the mouth\r\nwith an arrow, within a double tressure flory counter-flory, all\r\n_gules_, and above the escutcheon a mullet, _sable_, for difference,\r\nHoward; 2nd, _gules_, three lions passant guardant, _or_, and a label\r\nof three points, _argent_, Thomas of Brotherton, son of Edward I.; 3rd,\r\nchecky, _or_ and _azure_, Warren, Earl Warren and Surrey; 4th, _gules_,\r\na lion rampant, _argent_, Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk; 5th, _gules_, three\r\nescallops, _argent_, Dacre; 6th, barry of eight, _argent_ and _azure_,\r\nthree chaplets of roses, _proper_, Greystock. Crest—on a chapeau,\r\n_gules_, turned up ermine, a lion statant guardant, with the tail\r\nextended, _or_, ducally gorged, _argent_. Supporters—dexter, a lion,\r\n_argent_, charged with a mullet, _sable_, for difference; sinister,\r\na bull, _gules_, armed, unguled, ducally gorged and lined, _or_.\r\nMotto—“Valo non valeo” (“I am willing, but not able”).\r\n\r\nHis seats are Castle Howard, Yorkshire, and Naworth Castle, Cumberland.\r\n\r\nThe heir-presumptive to the titles and estates is, as just stated,\r\nAdmiral the Right Hon. Edward Granville George Howard, Baron Lanerton\r\nof Naworth, which peerage was bestowed on him in 1873. He was born in\r\n1809, entered the Royal Navy in 1823, and advanced step by step till\r\nhe became Admiral in 1870. He married, in 1842, Diana, daughter of the\r\nHon. George Ponsonby, by whom, however, he has no issue.\r\n\r\nIn the grounds of Castle Howard an avenue of about a mile in\r\nlength, bordered on either side by groups of ash-trees, leads to\r\na pretty, cosy, and comfortable inn, on the front of which is the\r\ninscription:—“CAROLUS HOWARD, COMES CARLIOLENSIS, HOC CONDIDIT ANNO\r\nDOMINI MDCCXIX.” It forms a sort of entrance gate to the park: the\r\nmansion, however, is a long way off, the whole length of the avenue\r\nfrom the road to the house being four miles, with the avenue of trees\r\ncontinued all the way. Midway is an obelisk one hundred feet in height,\r\nwhich contains the following inscriptions:—\r\n\r\n  “Virtute et Fortunæ, Johannes, Marlburiæ\r\n  Ducis Patriæ Europæquæ Defensoris.\r\n  Hoc saxum admirationi ac famæ\r\n  Sacrum Carolus Comes Carliol posuit,\r\n          Anno Domini MDCCXIV.”\r\n\r\n      “If to perfection these plantations rise,\r\n      If they agreeably my heirs surprise,\r\n      This faithful pillar will their age declare,\r\n      As long as time these characters shall spare;\r\n  Here then with kind remembrance read his name,\r\n  Who for posterity perform’d the same.”\r\n\r\n “Charles, the third Earl of Carlisle of the family of Howards, erected\r\n a Castle where the old Castle of Henderskelf[44] stood, and called it\r\n Castle Howard. He likewise made the plantations in this park, and all\r\n the outworks, monuments, and other plantations belonging to the said\r\n seat.\r\n\r\n “He began these works in the year MDCCII, and set up this inscription\r\n anno Domin MDCCXXXI.”\r\n\r\nThe history of the house is thus told; but it has no pretensions to the\r\nname of a castle: the mansion is free from all semblance of character\r\nas a place for defence, being simply and purely the domestic home of\r\nan English nobleman, though, as our engravings show, very beautiful in\r\nconstruction, of great extent, and perfect in all its appliances.\r\n\r\nIt is the _chef-d’œuvre_ of the architect, Sir John Vanbrugh, he\r\nwho laid in England “many a heavy load,” and whose graceful and\r\nemphatically “comfortable” structures, including notably that of\r\nBlenheim, adorn several of our English shires. Comparing Castle Howard\r\nwith Blenheim, Dr. Waagen writes—“The former is less ‘broken up’\r\nthan the latter, and though not of equal extent, has a grander and\r\nmore massive appearance. In the whole arrangement of the mansion and\r\nthe garden, the architect evidently had Versailles in his mind as the\r\nperfection of this style.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Mausoleum._]\r\n\r\nSir John Vanbrugh was, as his name indicates, of Dutch descent. He was\r\nborn at Chester in 1666. his father being a sugar-baker in that city.\r\nIn 1695, his architectural skill having acquired him some reputation,\r\nhe was appointed one of the commissioners for completing Greenwich\r\nPalace, at the time when it was about to be converted into a hospital.\r\nIn 1702 he built Castle Howard for the Earl of Carlisle, who was so\r\npleased with his skill, that, being at the time Deputy Earl Marshal of\r\nEngland, he conferred upon him the important appointment of Clarencieux\r\nKing-of-arms. In 1726 he died, and was buried in the church of St.\r\nStephen, Walbrook.\r\n\r\n_En route_ to the house, we pass, to the left, in a hollow adjoining\r\na broad lake, the Dairy, a pretty building picturesquely placed;\r\nand right before us is a steep ascent, from which there is a fine\r\nview—north, south, east, and west.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Dairy._]\r\n\r\nThe South Front shows Castle Howard in its finest point of view: it is\r\nin length 323 feet; the centre consists of a pediment and entablature\r\nsupported by fluted Corinthian pilasters; and the door is reached by\r\na flight of stately steps. “The North Front consists of an elaborate\r\ncentre of the Corinthian order, with a cupola rising from the top, and\r\non either side extensive wings—the east according to the original\r\ndesign, the west from a design by Sir James Robinson, which has been\r\nmore recently built in a very different style from the other wing; and,\r\nas the building has been deemed by some architectural critics to be\r\nwanting in the qualities of lightness and elegance, and uniformity of\r\nparts, to this circumstance is owing the alleged incongruity.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Great Hall._]\r\n\r\nFrom this point is the main or state entrance into the Great Hall,\r\npictured in the engraving. It is 65 feet high; a square of 35 feet; lit\r\nfrom a dome, the top of which is 100 feet from the floor. The principal\r\nentrance is on its north side, and the spaces between the piers on\r\nthat and on the south side are open the whole height of the arches.\r\nThe south side opens to the suite of apartments on the garden front,\r\nand a richly balustraded gallery gives access to the upper rooms.\r\nThe east and west sides are partly filled, the upper portions being\r\nopen, and showing the splendid ceilings of the staircase, &c. On one\r\nof these sides is the fire-place, and on the other a canopied recess.\r\nThe fire-place is a rich piece of sculptured marbles, and there are\r\npanels filled with pendent groups of musical instruments; allegories\r\ngrace the ceilings and walls, principally painted by Pellegrini; and\r\nstatues and busts are placed on pedestals, and otherwise adorn the\r\nsides. These allegorical paintings are, on the ceiling, the Fall of\r\nPhaëton; and on the walls, the four seasons, the signs of the zodiac,\r\nthe four quarters of the world, Apollo and Midas, Apollo and the Muses,\r\nMercury and Venus, Vulcan and his attributes, &c. Among the sculptures\r\nare Augustus, Marcus Aurelius, Sabina, Julia Mammea, Bacchus, Ceres,\r\nDiodumenus, Paris, Hadrian, Lucius Verus, Vitellius, Epaphroditus, Marc\r\nAntony, a bacchanal, and others.\r\n\r\nSeveral doors lead to the various apartments, the state-rooms being\r\nhung with pictures of inestimable worth, and all being decorated in\r\npure taste. To the pictures we shall presently refer.\r\n\r\nA gallery called the Antique Gallery—160 feet long, by 20 in\r\nwidth—contains a number of rare, beautiful, and valuable examples\r\nof Roman, Egyptian, and Greek antiquities, among which are many\r\nreally fine and unique specimens of early Art. It also contains many\r\ninteresting pictures and some good old tapestry. In the Museum has been\r\ncollected an immense variety of objects, gathered by several lords in\r\nvarious countries, with not a few precious relics found in the ancient\r\nlocalities of Yorkshire and Cumberland: among these are some examples\r\nof ancient mosaic-work, a curious basso-relievo of Mercury, a number of\r\nurns and inlaid marbles, and other objects. There is also here shown\r\na casket or wine-cooler of bog-oak, mounted in solid silver, a gift\r\nto the good Lord Carlisle by his constituents of the West Riding; it\r\nmeasures 3 feet 6 inches in length, by 2 feet 4 inches in height and\r\nbreadth, and cost about a thousand guineas; and “a monster address, 400\r\nfeet long,” presented to him on his retiring from the office of Chief\r\nSecretary for Ireland. One object of more than passing interest is\r\nan altar supposed to have “stood in the temple of Apollo at Delphi.”\r\nOn its top is a tablet bearing the following lines from the pen, we\r\nbelieve, of the Earl of Carlisle:—\r\n\r\n  “Pass not this ancient altar with disdain,\r\n    ’Twas once in Delphi’s sacred temple rear’d;\r\n  From this the Pythian pour’d her mystic strain,\r\n    While Greece its fate in anxious silence heard.\r\n\r\n  What chief, what hero of the Achaian race,\r\n    Might not to this have bow’d with holy awe,\r\n  Have clung in pious reverence round its base,\r\n    And from the voice inspired received the law?\r\n\r\n  A British chief, as famed in arms as those,\r\n    Has borne this relic o’er th’ Italian waves,\r\n  In war still friend to science, this bestows,\r\n    And Nelson gives it to the land he saves.”\r\n\r\nThe Saloon has an exquisitely painted allegorical ceiling representing\r\nAurora, and is also adorned by a large number of statues and busts, as\r\nwell as valuable paintings.\r\n\r\nThe Drawing-room is hung with rich tapestry after Rubens’ designs, and\r\nthe walls are adorned with many gems of Art. Among the other treasures\r\nin this elegant apartment are some fine antique bronzes.\r\n\r\nThe Gold or State Bed-room is hung with the finest Brussels tapestry,\r\nafter designs by Teniers. The chimney-piece is very elegant, being\r\nsupported by Corinthian columns, the shafts of Sienna marble, the\r\ncapitals, bases, and cornice white, with pigeons of polished white\r\nmarble in the centre of the frieze. Upon it stands a bust of Jupiter\r\nSerapis.\r\n\r\nThe Breakfast and Dining Rooms—and, indeed, the whole of the\r\napartments in the mansion—are elegantly and even sumptuously\r\nfurnished, and filled to repletion with objects of interest and of\r\n_virtu_.\r\n\r\nThe Crimson-figured Room has its walls painted, by Pellegrini, with a\r\nseries of incidents of the Trojan war: these are—the Rape of Helen,\r\nAchilles in disguise amidst the daughters of Lycomedes, King of Scyros,\r\nand Ulysses in search of him, Ajax and Ulysses contending for the\r\narmour of Achilles, Troy in flames, and Æneas bearing on his shoulders\r\nAnchises from the burning city.\r\n\r\nThe Blue Drawing-room, the Green Damask Room, the Yellow Bed-chamber,\r\nthe Silver Bed-room, the Blue Silk Bed-room, and, indeed, all the\r\nremaining apartments, need no further remark than that they are, in\r\ntheir furnishing and appointments, all that the most fastidious taste\r\ncould desire them to be.\r\n\r\nThe pictures that so lavishly adorn Castle Howard have been long\r\nrenowned. The collection contains some of the very finest examples\r\nof the great old masters to be found in Europe. The best of them\r\nonce formed part of the famous Orleans Gallery, and were acquired by\r\nthe Earl of Carlisle when the French Revolution of 1789 caused their\r\ndistribution.\r\n\r\nTo name all the works in this collection would occupy more space than\r\nwe can spare: chief among them all is “The Three Marys,” by Annibale\r\nCarracci; it suffices to name it as one of the world’s wonders in Art.\r\nAnd also “The Adoration of the Wise Men,” by Mabuse, the _chef-d’œuvre_\r\nof the master. Other grand examples are by Titian, Correggio,\r\nDomenichino, Guercino, Carlo Maratti, Giorgione, Primaticcio, Julio\r\nRomano, Tintoretto, Paolo Veronese, Velasquez, Cuyp, Claude, Ruysdael,\r\nVandyke, Rubens, Wouvermans, Breughel, Berghem, Jansen, Holbein,\r\nHuysman, Mabuse, Van der Velde, Teniers, and Canaletti. Of Canaletti\r\nthere are no fewer than forty-five examples—his best productions in\r\nhis best time—scattered throughout the corridors and rooms, with\r\nfamous specimens of Reynolds and Lawrence, and family portraits by\r\nother artists; notably those of Jackson, an artist who, from his\r\nobscure boyhood in Yorkshire, was encouraged and upheld by the House of\r\nCarlisle.\r\n\r\nThe history of the dispersion of the Orleans Gallery deserves\r\nrecord here. When the French prince, Philippe of Orleans, surnamed\r\n_Égalité_, wanted a sum of money to carry out his political projects,\r\nhe sold his entire gallery of pictures (in 1792) for a comparatively\r\ninsignificant amount: those of the Italian and French schools to a\r\nbanker of Brussels, and those of the Flemish, Dutch, and German schools\r\nto an Englishman, Mr. T. M. Slade. The Italian and French pictures\r\nsubsequently passed into the hands of a French gentleman, M. Laborde\r\nde Mèreville, who, being compelled to quit his country during the\r\nRevolution, caused his pictures to be brought to London, and ultimately\r\nsold them to Mr. Jeremiah Harman, a wealthy merchant. “Thus matters\r\nstood,” says Dr. Waagen, in his “Treasures of Art in Great Britain,”\r\n“till the year 1798, when Mr. Bryan”—the well-known picture-buyer, and\r\nauthor of the “Dictionary of Painters and Engravers,” a standard book\r\nof reference—“prevailed on the late Duke of Bridgewater, Earl Gower,\r\nafterwards Marquis of Stafford, and the Earl of Carlisle, to purchase\r\nthis splendid collection for the sum of £43,000, and thus to secure it\r\nfor ever to England.”\r\n\r\nThe Conservatories are remarkably fine, and well ordered with all the\r\nfloral treasures of the world, while the collection of hardy herbaceous\r\nplants congregated at Castle Howard, numbering upwards of six hundred\r\nspecies, is unmatched elsewhere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Garden._]\r\n\r\nOf the Gardens we give two engravings: the one chiefly to show a\r\ncharming fountain, a work of great merit, the production of the\r\nsculptor Thomas; the other to convey an idea of the peculiar and very\r\nbeautiful character of the grounds and their adornments—the terrace\r\nwalks, the lake, the summer-house (Temple of Diana), and the Mausoleum,\r\nenvironed by umbrageous woods; here and there vases judiciously\r\ninterspersed with memorial pillars, commemorating some striking event\r\nor some renowned benefactor of the race of the Howards.\r\n\r\nThe lawns and gardens are admirably laid out, somewhat trim and\r\nformal, but not out of character with the building of which they are\r\nadornments. The grounds are unsurpassed in beauty—that of which Nature\r\nhas been lavish, and that which is derived from Art.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Grand Fountain._]\r\n\r\nThe ornamental grounds are of vast extent, and are beautifully\r\ndiversified with the varied attractions of lake, lawn, and forest.\r\nThe parterre “occupies several acres of a cheerful lawn, of which a\r\nconsiderable space on the south front of the mansion is laid out in the\r\nmost tasteful and pleasing manner, and interspersed with flower-beds,\r\nclumps of evergreens and shrubs, and statuary.” The Raywood, approached\r\nby a gravel walk 687 yards in length, with its delightful walks and\r\ngrand old trees, also abounds with statuary. Near the iron gates at\r\nwhich this walk commences is the Rosary, and close by is a pedestal\r\nerected by one earl, and inscribed with some chastely beautiful lines\r\nby his successor. The Green Terrace Walk, 576 yards in length, is\r\nadorned with statuary, and Lady Mary Howard’s Garden is one of the most\r\nlovely features on the south front.\r\n\r\nThe Temple of Diana, from which charming views of the mansion and its\r\nsurroundings are obtained, is an Ionic erection, and bears in niches\r\nover its doors busts of Vespasian, Faustina, Trajan, and Sabina.\r\n\r\nThe Mausoleum, a circular domed structure, 35 feet in diameter in its\r\ninterior, and 98 feet in height, contains in its basement sixty-four\r\ncatacombs built under ground arches. Externally, it is surrounded by\r\na colonnade of twenty-one Doric columns. In the vaults are interred\r\nmany illustrious members of this truly noble family: among these are\r\nthe third, fourth, fifth, and sixth Earls of Carlisle; Frances and\r\nCaroline, Countesses of Carlisle; and some of the sons and daughters of\r\nthese “peerless peers and peeresses.” The Mausoleum is interesting as\r\nbeing the first, unconnected with a church, erected in England.\r\n\r\nThe Pyramid, on St. Ann’s Hill, 28 feet square at its base, and 50 feet\r\nin height, was raised in 1728 to the memory of William, Lord Howard,\r\nthird son of Thomas, Duke of Norfolk, who died in 1639. It contains in\r\nits interior a bust, with the inscription—\r\n\r\n “Gulielmus Dominus Howard, obiit x die Martis, ætatis suæ octogesimo\r\n primo, anno salutis MDCXXXIX;”\r\n\r\nand on its north side, on the exterior, the following inscription in\r\nmarble:—\r\n\r\n “William, Lord Howard, third son to Thomas, Duke of Norfolk, who\r\n was beheaded by Queen Elizabeth, married Elizabeth, one of the\r\n co-heiresses of William, Lord Dacre; by which marriage, and the said\r\n William’s great industry and ability, are descended to me most of the\r\n estates that I now possess; in grateful remembrance therefore of that\r\n noble and beneficent parent, and of that pious and virtuous lady, this\r\n monument is erected by Charles, the third Earl of Carlisle of the\r\n family of the Howards, their great-great-great-grandson, Anno Domini,\r\n 1728.\r\n\r\n  “To thee, O venerable shade,\r\n  Who long hast In oblivion laid,\r\n    This pile I here erect;\r\n  A tribute small for what thou’st done.\r\n  Deign to accept the mean return,\r\n    Pardon the long neglect.\r\n\r\n  “To thy long labours, to thy care,\r\n  Thy sons deceased, thy present heir,\r\n    Their great possessions owe.\r\n  Spirit Divine, what thanks are due?\r\n  This will thy memory renew,\r\n    It’s all I can bestow.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKEDLESTON HALL.\r\n\r\nKEDLESTON, the seat of Lord Scarsdale, is justly considered to be one\r\nof the most pure and chaste in design of any of the classical mansions\r\nof our English aristocracy. It may, therefore, both on that account\r\nand from the beauty of its situation, the interest attaching to the\r\nfamily of its noble owner, and the many associations which surround it,\r\nwell be called a “Stately Home,” and thus claim to be included in our\r\npresent volume. At the time of its erection, in 1761, it was pronounced\r\nto be one of the most perfect specimens of architectural taste in\r\nthe kingdom, and it has, consequently, been visited by many persons\r\nof note: these have, one and all been lavish in their praises of its\r\nproportions and parts, of the interior details and finishing, of the\r\npictures and articles of _virtu_ which it contains, and of its grand\r\nold park, studded with the finest of oaks and other forest trees.\r\n\r\nBray, who wrote in 1777, says of the present building—then, it must\r\nbe remembered, only newly erected—“Kedleston may properly be called\r\nthe glory of Derbyshire, eclipsing Chatsworth, the ancient boast of the\r\ncounty; the front is magnificent and beautiful, the apartments elegant,\r\nat the same time useful, a circumstance not always to be met with in\r\na great house.” This, of course, was before the great additions and\r\nalterations were made to and at Chatsworth, and therefore must not\r\nbe taken to refer to that palatial residence as it now stands. Since\r\nBray’s time, every writer who has spoken of Kedleston speaks in the\r\nsame strain of praise of its symmetry and design.\r\n\r\nBefore describing the hall, or speaking of its history, we will, as\r\nusual, give a brief genealogical account of the family of its noble\r\nowner. The Curzons are said to be descended from Geraline de Curson,\r\nor Curzon, who came over with the Conqueror, and was of Breton origin.\r\nThis Geraline de Curzon was lord of the manor of Locking, in Berkshire,\r\nand held, by the grant of the King, many other manors and lands in that\r\ncounty and in Oxfordshire. He was a great benefactor to the abbey of\r\nAbingdon. He had three sons, Stephen, Richard, and Geraline, by the\r\nfirst of whom he was succeeded. This Stephen de Curzon, besides the\r\nestates in Oxon and Berks to which he had succeeded, had the manor of\r\nFauld, in Staffordshire, granted to him by William de Ferrars, Earl of\r\nDerby. He had an only daughter, married to Nicholas Burton, of Fauld,\r\nand was succeeded by his brother, Richard de Curzon, who, in the reign\r\nof Henry I., held four knight’s fees in Kedleston, Croxhall, Twyford,\r\nand Edinghall, in the county of Derby. He was succeeded by his son\r\nRobert, who married Alice de Somervile, and was, in turn, succeeded\r\nby his eldest son, Richard, who married Petronel, daughter of Richard\r\nde Camville, Lord of Creek, or Creeth, by whom he had a son, Robert\r\nde Curzon, of Croxhall, “whose line terminated in an heir female,\r\nMary, daughter and sole heiress of Sir George Curzon, who was married\r\nto Edward Sackville, Duke of Dorset. Of this family was Cardinal de\r\nCurzon, so famous about the time of King John.” Thomas Curzon, grandson\r\nof Robert, was succeeded by another Thomas, whose son, Engelard Curzon\r\n(_temp._ Henry III.), left issue a son, Richard, who (25 Edward I.)\r\nheld a fourth part of a knight’s fee at Kedleston. His son, Ralph, was\r\nfather of Richard de Curzon, who (4 Edward III.) held three parts of a\r\nknight’s fee at Kedleston, and was succeeded by his son, Sir Roger de\r\nCurzon, of Kedleston, Knt., who was living _temp._ Richard I. His son,\r\nSir John Curzon, who was one of the King’s Council, married Eleanor,\r\ndaughter of Sir Robert Twyford, and was succeeded by his son John,\r\nwho married Margaret, daughter of Sir Nicholas de Montgomery, by whom\r\nhe had issue three sons—viz. Richard, who succeeded him; Walter, who\r\nmarried Isabel, daughter of Robert Saunders, Esq., of Harrington, in\r\nthe county of Northampton, from which marriage descended the Curzons\r\nof Water-Perry; and Henry, who was the great-grandfather of Sir Robert\r\nCurzon, created a baron of the German empire by Maximilian in 1500, and\r\na baron of England by Henry VIII., but died without issue. The line of\r\nCurzon of Water-Perry, just now alluded to, passed successively from\r\nWalter Curzon through his son and grandson, Richard and Vincent, to Sir\r\nFrancis Curzon, Knt., who married Anne, daughter of Judge Southcote;\r\nhis son, Sir John Curzon, who married Mary, daughter of Robert, Lord\r\nDormer; Sir Thomas Curzon, Bart. (son of the last), who married\r\nElizabeth Burrow, and was created a baronet in 1661; his son, Sir John\r\nCurzon, Bart., who was succeeded by his son, Sir Francis Curzon, Bart.,\r\nwho died without surviving issue. The baronetcy thus became extinct,\r\nthe family estates of Water-Perry devolving eventually upon Francis,\r\nLord Teynham, who, in consequence, assumed the surname of Curzon in\r\naddition to that of Roper.\r\n\r\nRichard Curzon, the eldest son and successor of John Curzon and his\r\nwife, Margaret Montgomery (just named), was, in the 11th year of\r\nHenry VI., Captain of Sandgate Castle, Kent, and was succeeded by\r\nhis son, John Curzon, of Kedleston. This gentleman, generally known\r\nas “John with the white head,” was high sheriff of the counties of\r\nNottingham and Derby in the 15th year of Henry VI., and, four years\r\nlater, escheator for the same. He married Joan, daughter of Sir John\r\nBagot, by whom he had issue one son, Richard, and four daughters,\r\none of whom married John Ireton, of Ireton, in Derbyshire, and was\r\ngreat-great-grandmother of General Henry Ireton, the celebrated\r\nParliamentarian officer.\r\n\r\nRichard Curzon married Alice Willoughby, of Wollaton, of the family\r\nof Lord Middleton, and, dying in 1496, left issue by her, two\r\nsons—John and Henry—and a daughter, Elizabeth, who was prioress of\r\nKing’s Mead, Derby. This John de Curzon was high sheriff on three\r\ndifferent occasions, and died in the 4th year of Henry VIII. He married\r\nElizabeth, daughter of Stephen Eyre, of Hassop, and was succeeded by\r\nhis only son and heir, Richard, who married Helen, daughter of German\r\nPole, of Radbourne, by whom he had issue four sons and three daughters.\r\nThe eldest son, John, dying without issue, was succeeded by his\r\nbrother Francis (aged twenty-five, 2 Edward VI.), who married Eleanor,\r\nco-heiress of Thomas Vernon, of Stokesley, through whom a claim to the\r\nbarony of Powis was brought into the family. By this lady he had issue\r\nfour sons (from one of whom the Curzons of Minley were descended) and\r\ntwo daughters. He was succeeded by his eldest son, John Curzon, who\r\ntook to wife Millicent, daughter of Sir Ralph Sacheverell, and widow\r\nof Sir Thomas Gell, of Hopton. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Sir\r\nJohn Curzon, created a baronet by Charles I. Sir John, who represented\r\nthe county of Derby in Parliament, 15 and 16 of Charles I., married\r\nPatience, daughter of Sir Thomas Crewe, and sister of John, Lord Crewe,\r\nof Steene, by whom he had issue four sons—John, Francis, and Thomas,\r\nwho all died without issue, and Nathaniel, who succeeded him—and three\r\ndaughters—Patience, who died unmarried; Eleanor, who married Sir John\r\nArcher, one of the judges of the Court of Common Pleas; and Jane, who\r\nmarried John Stanhope, son of Sir John Stanhope, of Elvaston, brother\r\nof Philip, Earl of Chesterfield.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Hall and Bridge from the Park._]\r\n\r\nSir Nathaniel Curzon, Bart., succeeded his father in 1686. He married\r\nSarah, daughter of William Penn, of Penn, in the county of Bucks, by\r\nwhom he had issue five sons and four daughters, and died in 1718.\r\nHis sons were—Sir John, who succeeded him; Sir Nathaniel, who also\r\nsucceeded to the title and estates; Francis, who was a Turkey merchant,\r\nand died at Aleppo unmarried; William, who represented Clitheroe in\r\nParliament; and Charles, LL.D. Sir John Curzon, Bart., who represented\r\nthe county of Derby in Parliament during the whole of the reign of\r\nQueen Anne, died unmarried in 1727, when the baronetcy and estates\r\npassed to his brother, Sir Nathaniel Curzon, who also represented, till\r\nhis death in 1758, the county of Derby in Parliament. He married Mary,\r\ndaughter and co-heiress of Sir Ralph Assheton, Bart., of Middleton,\r\ncounty Lancaster, by whom he had issue three sons—-John, who died in\r\ninfancy; Nathaniel, first Baron Scarsdale; and Assheton, first Viscount\r\nCurzon, and father of the first Earl Howe. This Assheton Curzon,\r\ncreated Baron and Viscount Curzon of Penn, was member of Parliament\r\nfor Clitheroe. He married, first, Esther, daughter of William Hanmer,\r\nEsq., by whom he had issue the Hon. Penn Assheton Curzon; secondly,\r\nDorothy, sister of the first Earl of Grosvenor, by whom, with other\r\nissue, he had a son, Robert, who married the Baroness Zouche; and,\r\nthirdly, Anna Margaretta Meredith, by whom he had no issue. The Hon.\r\nPenn Assheton Curzon, just alluded to, eldest son of Viscount Curzon,\r\nmarried Charlotte Sophia, Baroness Howe, by whom he had issue seven\r\nsons and three daughters, the eldest of whom was Richard William Penn\r\nCurzon-Howe, created Earl Howe, who married twice—first, the Lady\r\nHarriet Georgiana Brudenell, daughter of the Earl of Cardigan, by whom,\r\nwith others, he had issue the late Earl Howe; and, secondly, Ann Gore,\r\nmaid of honour to Queen Adelaide, by whom also he had issue. The Earl\r\ndied in 1870, and was succeeded by his eldest son, George Augustus\r\nFrederick Louis Curzon-Howe, as second Earl Howe, Viscount Curzon,\r\nBaron Curzon of Penn, and Baron Howe of Langar, who was born in 1821,\r\nand was M.P. for South Leicestershire from 1857 to the time of his\r\naccession to the peerage. His lordship married, in 1846, Harriet Mary,\r\ndaughter of the late Henry Charles Sturt, Esq., M.P., by whom, however,\r\nhe had no issue. He died in 1876, and was succeeded by his brother,\r\nthe Hon. Richard William Penn Curzon-Howe. The present peer, who is\r\nthird Earl Howe, Viscount Curzon, Baron Curzon of Penn, and Baron Howe\r\nof Langar, was born in 1822, and, having entered the army, became\r\nCaptain in 1844, Major 1853, Lieut.-Colonel 1854, Colonel 1857, and\r\nMajor-General 1868. Having served in the Kaffir war as Aide-de-camp to\r\nSir George Cathcart, and at the siege of Delhi, at which time he was\r\nActing Assistant Quartermaster-General, he became Military Secretary\r\nto the Commander-in-chief in India, and was also an Aide-de-camp to\r\nH.R.H. the Duke of Cambridge. His lordship married, in 1858, Isabella\r\nKatherine, daughter of Major-General the Hon. George Anson, and has\r\nissue, besides other children, a son, the Hon. George Richard Penn\r\nCurzon-Howe, who is heir to the titles and estates.\r\n\r\nSir Nathaniel Curzon died in 1758, and was succeeded by his eldest son,\r\nNathaniel Curzon, who, in 1761, was raised to the peerage by the style\r\nand title of Baron Scarsdale of Scarsdale, in the county of Derby—the\r\ntitle being derived from the hundred of Scarsdale in that county. His\r\nlordship had previously married the Lady Catherine Colyear, daughter of\r\nthe Earl of Portmore, by whom he had issue five sons and one daughter.\r\nHe died in 1804, and was succeeded in his title and estates by his\r\neldest son, the Hon. Nathaniel Curzon, as second Lord Scarsdale. This\r\nnobleman married, first, the Hon. Sophia Susannah Noel, sister and\r\nco-heiress of Thomas, Viscount Wentworth, by whom (who died in 1782) he\r\nhad issue the Hon. Nathaniel, who succeeded him, and the Hon. Sophia\r\nCaroline, who married Robert Viscount Tamworth, son of Earl Ferrars.\r\nLord Scarsdale married, secondly, a Roman Catholic lady, Félicité Anne\r\nde Wattines, of Tournay, in Belgium, by whom (who died in 1850) he had,\r\nwith other issue, the Hon. and Rev. Alfred Curzon; the Hon. Francis\r\nJames Curzon, barrister-at-law; the Hon. Mary Elizabeth, married to\r\nJohn Beaumont, Esq., of Barrow; and the Hon. Caroline Esther, married\r\nto William Drury Holden, Esq., of Locko Park, in Derbyshire, who\r\nassumed the surname of Lowe instead of that of Holden, and is well\r\nknown as William Drury Lowe, Esq.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Nathaniel Curzon succeeded his father as third Lord Scarsdale\r\nin 1837, but died unmarried in 1856, when the title and estates\r\npassed to his nephew, the present peer, the Rev. Alfred Nathaniel\r\nHolden Curzon, second son of the Hon. and Rev. Alfred Curzon, already\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. and Rev. Alfred Curzon, eldest son, by his second marriage,\r\nof the second Lord Scarsdale, was born in 1801, and married in 1825\r\nSophia, daughter of Robert Holden, Esq., of Nuttall Temple, by whom he\r\nhad issue two sons—George Nathaniel Curzon, Esq., who was accidentally\r\nkilled by being thrown from his horse, and the Rev. Alfred Nathaniel\r\nHolden Curzon, the present Lord Scarsdale—and two daughters, Sophia\r\nFélicité Curzon and Mary Curzon, the elder being married to W. H. De\r\nRodes, Esq., of Barlborough Hall, and the younger to Lord Arthur Edwin\r\nHill-Trevor, son of the Marquis of Downshire. He died in January, 1850.\r\n\r\nThe present peer, the Rev. Alfred Nathaniel Holden Curzon, succeeded\r\nhis uncle in the title and estates as fourth Baron Scarsdale, and as\r\na baronet, in 1856. His lordship, who was born in 1831, was educated\r\nat Rugby, and at Merton College, Oxford, where he graduated B.A. in\r\n1852, and M.A. in 1865. In 1856 he became Rector of Kedleston, and in\r\nthe same year married Blanche, second daughter of Joseph Pocklington\r\nSenhouse, Esq., of Nether Hall, Cumberland, by whom he has issue\r\nliving—the Hon. George Nathaniel, heir-apparent, born 1859; the Hon.\r\nAlfred Nathaniel, born 1860; the Hon. Francis Nathaniel, born 1865;\r\nthe Hon. Assheton Nathaniel, born 1867; the Hon. Sophia Caroline, born\r\n1857; the Hon. Blanche Felicia, born 1861; the Hon. Eveline Mary, born\r\n1864; the Hon. Elinor Florence, born 1869; the Hon. Geraldine Emily,\r\nborn 1871; and the Hon. Margaret Georgiana, born 1874. Lady Scarsdale\r\ndied in 1875. His lordship is patron of five livings (viz. Kedleston,\r\nQuarndon, Mickleover, and Littleover, in Derbyshire, and Worthington,\r\nin Leicestershire), and is a magistrate for the county of Derby.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Arms of Scarsdale._]\r\n\r\nThe arms of Lord Scarsdale are—_argent_, on a bend, _sable_, three\r\npopinjays, _or_, collared, _gules_. Crest—a popinjay rising, wings\r\ndisplayed and inverted, _or_, collared, _gules_. Supporters—dexter,\r\na female figure representing Prudence, habited, _argent_, mantled,\r\n_azure_, holding in her sinister hand a javelin, entwined with a\r\nremora, _proper_; sinister, a female figure representing Liberality,\r\nhabited, _argent_, mantled, _purpure_, holding in both hands a\r\ncornucopia, resting against her shoulder, _proper_. Motto—“Recte et\r\nsuaviter.”\r\n\r\nThe title of “Scarsdale” had previously been held by the family\r\nof Leake, but had become extinct. The Leakes were descended from\r\nAdam de Leca, of Leak, in Nottinghamshire, who was living in 1141.\r\nWilliam Leake, or Leke, who settled at Sutton-in-the-Dale, or, as it\r\nis frequently called, Sutton-Scarsdale, in Derbyshire, early in the\r\nfifteenth century, was a younger son of Sir John Leake, of Gotham.\r\nOne of his descendants, Sir Francis Leke, Knt., married one of the\r\nco-heiresses of Swift, of Rotherham, and by her had issue a son,\r\nFrancis Leke, who, on the institution of the order of baronetcy, was\r\ncreated a baronet in 1611. In 1624 he was created Baron Deincourt\r\nof Sutton, and, having taken an active part for the King during the\r\ncivil wars, was in 1645 raised to the dignity of Earl of Scarsdale.\r\nHe married Anne, daughter of Sir Edward Carey, Knt., and had issue\r\nby her—Nicholas, his successor; Francis, Edward, and Charles, slain\r\nin battle; and six daughters, one of whom was married to Viscount\r\nGormanston, and another to Charles, Lord Lucas. His lordship felt\r\nthe execution of his royal master, Charles I., so acutely, that he\r\nclothed himself in sackcloth, and, causing his grave to be dug some\r\nyears before his death, laid himself in it every Friday for divine\r\nmeditation and prayer. He died in 1665, and was succeeded by his son\r\nNicholas as second Earl of Scarsdale and Baron Deincourt. This nobleman\r\nmarried Lady Frances Rich, daughter of the Earl of Warwick, and died\r\nin 1680. His eldest son, Robert, succeeded to the titles and estates,\r\nand having married Mary, one of the co-heiresses of Sir John Lewis, was\r\nmade Lord-Lieutenant of Derbyshire, Colonel of Horse, and Groom of the\r\nStole to Prince George of Denmark. Dying in 1707, he was succeeded,\r\nas fourth Earl of Scarsdale and Baron Deincourt, by his nephew, Sir\r\nNicholas Leke, who, dying unmarried in 1736, the titles, including the\r\nbaronetcy, became extinct.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Arms of Leke._]\r\n\r\nThe old hall of Kedleston, the ancient residence of the Curzon family\r\nfor many generations, stood nearly on the site occupied by the present\r\nmagnificent mansion. It was a fine quadrangular brick building of three\r\nstories in height, the entrance being under an advanced balustraded\r\nportico of three arches. Adjoining the house were training paddocks\r\nand all the appliances for the stud which was kept up. Of this house,\r\nfortunately, a painting is preserved in the present mansion. Not so\r\nof the still older house, of which no representation appears to be\r\nremaining. It must, however, judging from the records of the armorial\r\nbearings which decorated its stained-glass windows when the survey\r\nwas made in 1667, have been a building possessed of many noticeable\r\nfeatures. In the north window of the hall of 1677 we find recorded\r\nsome of the bearings of the most distinguished families of the time,\r\nwhich seem to throw a strong light on the connections of the Curzon\r\nfamily. Among the arms, either alone or quartered or impaled, were, it\r\nseems, in the north window of the hall, Curzon, Twyford, Arden, Bek\r\nor Beke, Gresley, Wasteneys, Chandos of Radborne, Talbot, Furnival,\r\nand Montgomery of Cubley; in the south windows those of Curzon and\r\nBagot; in another window those of Curzon, Vernon, Ludlow, Poole or\r\nPole, and the device of the House of Lancaster; at the upper end of the\r\nhall, Curzon and Pole with Pole’s quarterings, Curzon alone, Curzon\r\nand Vernon with Vernon’s quarterings, and Curzon and Sacheverell\r\nwith Sacheverell’s quarterings. About the room the following coats\r\nwere irregularly dispersed—viz. Sacheverell, Vernon, Pole, Bagot,\r\nMontgomery, Ireton, Minors, Curzon, Twyford, and Brailsford; and on the\r\ninside of the large chimney of the Buttery were Touchet, Lord Audley\r\nof Marston, Erm, a chevron and lion rampt, but the colours gone, and\r\nLatimer or Greville (a cross fleury), and Frecheville. On the outside\r\nof the same chimney, a saltier without colour; Montgomery as before;\r\na border of horse-shoes, probably Ferrers; Griffith of Whichnor, &c.\r\nThese were presumed to be about the date of Henry IV., and the door was\r\nsupposed at that time to be at least three hundred years old.\r\n\r\nThe old hall and the venerable church are said to have stood about the\r\ncentre of the then village of Kedleston, and a corn-mill was near. The\r\nwhole of the village, every house and every vestige of habitation,\r\nthe “small inn for the accommodation of those who came to drink of a\r\nmedicinal well, which has the virtues of the Harrogate water,” the\r\ncorn-mill, and the old hall itself, were removed by the first Lord\r\nScarsdale to make room for the present mansion, which he erected in\r\n1765: the church alone remained. The village was removed to a charming\r\nspot a short distance off; the corn-mill was taken away; the stream\r\nwhich turned its wheel was converted into the magnificent lake that\r\nforms so fine a feature in the present park; the turnpike-road was\r\nremoved to a distance of more than half a mile; and the “small inn” was\r\nreplaced by the present capacious Kedleston Inn, some three-quarters of\r\na mile away from its original site.\r\n\r\nThe present edifice was built from the designs of Robert Adam, one\r\nof the architect brothers of the Adelphi, and is considered to\r\nbe his masterpiece. It consists of a noble central pile with two\r\nadvanced wings or pavilions, with which it is connected by two curved\r\ncorridors. The principal or north front has a grand central portico,\r\nthe entablature and pediment of which are supported by six magnificent\r\ncolumns, 30 feet high, and 3 feet in diameter: some of these are\r\ncomposed of one single stone their entire length. They are designed\r\nfrom those at the Pantheon at Rome. The entrance in the portico is\r\napproached by a double or reflected flight of stone steps, which again\r\nare marvellous for the size of the stones: they are 10 feet in length,\r\nand each stone forms two steps. The pediment is surmounted by figures\r\nof Venus, Bacchus, and Ceres, and the sculptured _bassi-relievi_\r\n(by Collins) represent vintage, pasturage, harvest, ploughing, and\r\nboar-hunting; while within the porticos are statues of a Bacchante, two\r\nof the Muses, and a Vestal. The Arcade, leading to Cæsar’s Hall, and\r\nthe Corridors, are designed from the Amphitheatre. The Grand Entrance\r\nis in the centre of the portico, and opens at once into the Great Hall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The North Front._]\r\n\r\nThe Great Hall, a noble room, and one of the finest classical\r\napartments in existence in the purity of its style, the beauty of its\r\ndetails, and the perfection of its proportions, is about 67 feet in\r\nlength by 42 feet in width, and 40 feet in height. The vaulted ceiling\r\nrises to the full height of the house, and is supported on twenty\r\nfluted Corinthian columns 25 feet in height, and 2 feet 6 inches in\r\ndiameter. These columns, which are “the glory of Kedleston,” are\r\nof native alabaster from Red Hill, in Leicestershire. The Hall is\r\ndecorated with paintings and sculpture, the whole being classical,\r\nand in perfect keeping with the design of the building itself. The\r\nsubjects of the _chiaro-oscuro_ paintings on the east side are—“Helen\r\nreproaching Paris, and silenced by Venus,” “Achilles receiving Armour\r\nfrom Thetis,” “Achilles delivering his Armour to Patroclus,” and\r\n“Mercury, Juno, and Neptune before Jupiter;” on the west side, “Helen\r\nand Paris,” “The Judgment of Paris,” “Hector and Andromache,” and\r\n“Juno and Minerva.” At the ends are “Apollo and the Hours,” “Night\r\ndistributing her Poppies,” and “Sacrifices to Sylvanus, Diana, Apollo,\r\nand Mars.” Over the doors are four marriage subjects. The statues\r\nare Apollo Belvedere, Meleager, Idol, Venus, Faun, Apollo Vil. Med.,\r\nUrania, Faun, Venus, Ganymede, Antinous, and Mercury. From the Hall the\r\nDining-room is entered on the right, the Music-room on the left, and\r\nthe Saloon at the south end.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Great Hall._]\r\n\r\nOur account of the principal rooms must necessarily be very brief. It\r\nis enough to say that they are all fitted and finished in the most\r\nexquisite taste and in the most sumptuous manner, and are hung, or\r\nrather decorated—for the greater part of the pictures are let into\r\nthe walls, as a part of the original design—with one of the best\r\ncollections of paintings any house can boast.\r\n\r\nThe Music-room, a remarkably elegant apartment, contains many notable\r\npictures, especially an “Old Man’s Head” by Rembrandt, Giordano’s\r\n“Triumph of Bacchus,” Guido’s “Bacchus and Ariadne,” Guercino’s\r\n“David’s Triumph,” and Leonardo da Vinci’s “Holy Family.” The\r\nchimney-piece contains a beautiful bas-relief by Spang. The Corridor\r\nand Corridor Staircase also contain many choice pictures.\r\n\r\nThe Drawing-room is a gorgeous apartment, hung with blue damask.\r\nIt is 44 feet in length and 28 feet in width and height, and has a\r\nbeautiful coved ceiling. The door-cases are finished with Corinthian\r\ncolumns of Derbyshire alabaster, and the chimney-piece of Italian\r\nmarble is supported by two exquisitely sculptured whole-length female\r\nfigures. The furniture, especially the couches, is of the most gorgeous\r\ncharacter—the carved and gilt figures and foliage being in the very\r\nhighest and purest style of Art. The paintings in this room include\r\nsplendid examples by Annibale Carracci, Paul Veronese, old Francks,\r\nBreughel, Teniers, Cuyp, Mompert, Andrea del Sarto, Domenichino,\r\nRaffaelle, Swanevelt, Guido Reni, Benedetto Luti, Polemberg, Bernardo\r\nStrozzi, Claude Lorraine, Tintoretto, Parmigiano, and others of the old\r\nmasters.\r\n\r\nThe Library—a noble room fitted with mahogany book-cases, a Doric\r\nentablature, and mosaic ceiling—contains among its pictures Vandyke’s\r\n“Shakspere,” Rembrandt’s “Daniel interpreting to Nebuchadnezzar,” and\r\nexamples of Giordano, Carlo Loti, Drost, Michael Angelo, Salvator Rosa,\r\nPoussin, and others. It also contains busts of Homer, Sappho, Socrates,\r\nVirgil, Anacreon, Pindar, and Horace.\r\n\r\nThe Saloon is a grand circular apartment, 42 feet in diameter, and 63\r\nfeet high to the rose in the dome. It is considered, and truly, to be\r\none of the most beautiful rooms of its kind in Europe. Its decorations\r\nare interesting from the classic taste displayed in designing them,\r\nand the elegance with which they are executed. It is divided into four\r\nrecesses, or alcoves, having fire-places representing altars, with\r\nsphinxes, &c., adorned with classical figures in bas-relief; these\r\nalternate with as many doors; the whole painted and ornamented with\r\nwhite and gold. Over the doors are paintings of ruins by Hamilton (the\r\nframes representing the supporters of the family arms), and above the\r\nrecesses are delineations in _chiaro-oscuro_ by Rebecca—the subjects\r\nfrom English history. The pillars, of scagliola marble, are by Bartoli.\r\nThe dome is white and gold, finished in octagonal compartments with\r\nroses. The candle branches are of peculiar elegance, and beneath them\r\nis a charming series of exquisite bas-reliefs of Cupids, &c. The Saloon\r\nopens on its respective sides into the Great Hall, the Library, the\r\nAnte-chamber, and the south or garden front of the hall. From the\r\nante-chamber, in which are Carlo Maratti’s “St. John” and many other\r\nvaluable paintings, is reached—\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Saloon._]\r\n\r\nThe Principal Dressing-room, hung with blue damask, which contains,\r\namong others, life-size portraits of the first Lord and Lady Scarsdale\r\nby Hone; the second Lord Scarsdale by Reinagle, and his first wife\r\nby Hone; Charles I. by Vandyke; Prince Rupert’s daughter by Kneller;\r\nPrince Henry by Jansen; Prior by Kneller; and other paintings by Lely,\r\nVandyke, Cimaroli, and others.\r\n\r\nThe State Bed-room is hung with blue damask, and contains a remarkably\r\nfine assemblage of family portraits, landscapes, and other pictures,\r\namong which are Sir Nathaniel and Lady Curzon by Richardson; Duchess of\r\nYork by Lely; and the Countess of Dorset, daughter of George Curzon,\r\nafter Mytens.\r\n\r\nThe Wardrobe, which adjoins, is principally remarkable for a fine\r\ncollection of thirty-six ancient enamels after Albert Dürer,\r\nrepresenting the life of our Saviour, and for the many fine family\r\nportraits and other paintings which it contains. Among these are—Lady\r\nCurzon and her sons, by Dobbs; Countess of Dorchester, by Kneller; the\r\nwife and child of Quentin Matsys, by himself; Hon. Caroline Curzon, by\r\nAngelica Kauffmann; Hon. H. Curzon, by Hamilton; family portraits, by\r\nHone and Barber; the “Nativity” and the “Resurrection,” by Murillo; and\r\nthe first Lady Scarsdale, by Hudson.\r\n\r\nThe Dining-room is of faultless proportions, and its fittings—all\r\nprecisely as originally planned by the architect—are in the best and\r\npurest taste. The ceiling is magnificently painted in compartments by\r\nZucchi. The centre represents “Love embracing Fortune;” the oblong\r\nsquares, the four Seasons; and the small circles, Europe, Asia, Africa,\r\nand America. In front of the recessed sideboard is a magnificent\r\ncistern, or cooler, cut out of a solid block of Sicilian jasper; and\r\namong the pictures are examples of Snyders, Zuccarelli, Ciro Ferri,\r\nClaude Lorraine, Jean Fyt, Romanelli, Helmbrecker, and others, and\r\nbas-reliefs by Collins and Spang.\r\n\r\nOn the Great Staircase are also many choice paintings (including, among\r\nothers, examples of Carlo Maratti, Hamilton, and old Stone, and some\r\nfine statues and candelabra), while in the family wing of the house—in\r\nLady Scarsdale’s Boudoir, the Ante-room, the Breakfast-room, and the\r\nother apartments—the assemblage of works of Art is very extensive\r\nand valuable. In the Corridor, too, are some good paintings, and many\r\narticles of _virtu_; while in the chimney-piece is an extremely fine\r\nplaque of Wedgwood’s jasper-ware.\r\n\r\nThe opposite wing is occupied by the Kitchen—a noble apartment with\r\na gallery at one end, supported on Doric columns, and having over its\r\nfire-place the admirable motto, “Waste not, want not”—and the other\r\ndomestic offices.\r\n\r\nCæsar’s Hall is the basement story beneath the portico, and is\r\ndecorated with busts of the Cæsars, and medallions of Homer, Hesiod,\r\nHorace, and Tully; and in the Tetrastyle Hall, the staircases, and\r\nother parts of the building, are numerous works of Art of one kind or\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe Garden Front, shown in the opposite engraving, is an adaptation of\r\nan idea taken from the design of the Arch of Constantine. The statues\r\nin the niches are Flora Farnese and an antique Bacchus. Over the\r\npillars are medallions of Apollo and Diana, and the statues above are\r\nthe Pastoral and the Comic Muses, Prudence, and Diana. By the steps are\r\nthe Medicean and Borghese vases.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The South or Garden Front._]\r\n\r\nThe entrance to the noble park of Kedleston is by a lodge, designed\r\nby Adams from the Arch of Octavia. From it the drive to the house\r\nis about a mile in length, amidst the finest forest trees, beneath\r\nwhich hundreds of deer browse in every direction. Nearing the house,\r\nthe drive is carried over the magnificent lake on a bridge of purely\r\nclassical design, enriched by statuary; and from it one of the finest\r\nviews of the mansion and its surroundings is obtained. Near to the\r\ndrive is a charmingly picturesque fountain, whose waters are constantly\r\nflowing through a lion’s mouth.\r\n\r\nIn the park are the medicinal springs known as “Kedleston Baths,” over\r\nwhich a plain, but picturesque, building was erected many years ago.\r\nThe waters are the best of the sulphureous springs of Derbyshire,\r\nand approach closely, on analysis, to those of Harrogate. They were\r\nformerly in much repute, and years ago it was quite a trade for the\r\npoor people of Derby to fetch these waters to the town, where they\r\nwere sold at a penny per quart, and were drunk in place of malt liquor\r\nby many of the inhabitants. Kedleston, in the latter part of last\r\ncentury, was, indeed, a very favourite resort with the Derby people,\r\nas is evidenced by the following curious advertisement of the year\r\n1776:—“Kedleston Fly. Twice a day during the Summer Season. Will set\r\nout on Monday next, the 20th inst., from John Campion’s, the Bell Inn,\r\nin Sadler-gate, Derby; each person to pay One Shilling and Sixpence. A\r\ngood Ordinary is provided each day at Kedleston Inn. If desired, the\r\ncoach may be had from nine in the morning till two in the afternoon.”\r\nAt Quarn, or Quarndon, about a mile distant, is another medicinal\r\nspring—this time of chalybeate waters, which were, and yet are, with\r\nthose of Kedleston, much esteemed.\r\n\r\nOf the fine old oaks in Kedleston Park it is enough to say they are\r\namong the largest and most picturesque in the kingdom, the “King Oak”\r\nbeing twenty-two feet in circumference at the bole, and the “Queen Oak”\r\nnearly as much—a truly stately and royal pair. Many others are also\r\nenormous in girth and stature. Of these oaks the Hon. Grantley Berkeley\r\nthus graphically writes:—“In the park and vale of Berkeley, as well\r\nas in the Forest of Dean, I have been used to view the oak-tree in\r\nperfection, as well as in gigantic decay, as in the case at Berkeley\r\nof ‘King William’s Oak,’ at the entrance to the park, set down as that\r\ntree was, and is now, in Domesday Book as a tree then so much larger\r\nthan its fellows as to be selected in the survey as a mark for the\r\nparish or hundred of Berkeley. With all this timber lore, however, the\r\ntall oaks of Kedleston Hall astonished me, not in a few instances,\r\nbut in hundreds, or indeed all over the park. Timber of all kinds\r\nstood on those emerald undulations (for never was a park or pasture\r\ngreener), valued by their proprietor as much for intrinsic worth as\r\nfor picturesque beauty, honoured in age, as they had been spared when\r\nfrom their ranks might have been hewn a fortune. So struck was I with\r\nthe invariable size of these trees, that while casting a curious eye\r\nthrough the herds of deer to make myself acquainted with the best buck\r\nin that early season, destined for a trial of Pape’s breech-loading\r\nrifle—which had been returned to his hands to be rearranged after\r\nthe trick it played me in the forest of Lord Breadalbane some time\r\nago—I could not help stepping their circumference at the roots\r\nof some of them, the extent of which was as follows. The oaks very\r\ncommonly reached to fourteen yards where they entered the ground, and\r\nranged from that to fifteen and seventeen yards; while the ‘King Oak,’\r\nstanding by his ‘Queen’ of nearly the same size, measured twenty-two\r\nyards where it sought the earth. Three feet from the ground the girth\r\nof this monarch of the forest is twenty-five feet nine inches, and the\r\ntimber contained in the tree is calculated at from eleven hundred to\r\ntwelve hundred feet. The extraordinary beauty of these oaks—and their\r\nname, so to speak, is legion—lies in their immensely tall straight\r\ngrowth from the ground, scarcely ever putting forth a limb within reach\r\nof my upstretched hand. The same luxuriant fact in this enchanting park\r\nexists with all kinds of trees, and some of the broad-leafed elms round\r\nwhose boles I stepped measured fifteen yards. Lord Scarsdale takes\r\nbeautiful care of his trees, and when some high wind tears down a huge\r\narm from his favourites, the splinters are all sawn smoothly off from\r\nthe stem, and the wound is capped with lead to prevent the entrance of\r\nwater.”\r\n\r\nAnd now for a word or two on the Church, which is one of the most\r\ncharming old buildings in the country. Long may it be kept from the\r\nhands of the “restorer!” The edifice is cruciform, consisting of a\r\nnave, chancel, north and south transepts, and central tower—the\r\nsouth transept being the mortuary chapel of the Curzons. The south\r\ndoorway of the nave is early Norman, with beak-head mouldings and a\r\nsculptured tympanum; and the “priest’s door” in the chancel is equally\r\ninteresting, although of later date.\r\n\r\nIn the chancel is a remarkably fine monument to Sir Nathaniel Curzon,\r\nBart., who died in 1758, aged eighty-four, designed by Robert Adam,\r\nthe architect of Kedleston, and executed by Michael Rysbrach in 1763;\r\nand another monument erected in 1737 to Sir Nathaniel Curzon, and Dame\r\nSarah, his wife, daughter of William Penn, Esq. There are also a fine,\r\nbut partially mutilated, brass to an early Curzon, and an incised slab\r\nto William Curzon, 1544. The east window of stained glass, “In Memory\r\nof George Nathaniel Curzon, born Oct. 1826; died June 17, 1855,” is of\r\nbeautiful design. In the floor of the chancel, on removing two massive\r\ncircular pieces of wood mounted with rings, about a foot below the\r\nsurface, each within a deeply cut quatrefoil, are the heads of a knight\r\nin armour and of a lady in veil and whimple. There is no inscription\r\nconnected with these extremely curious and unusual monuments, but they\r\nmost probably represent a knight and lady of the Curzon family.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Kedleston Church, from the West._]\r\n\r\nIn the Curzon Chapel, south transept, are fine old monuments, some of\r\nwhich are shown in the opposite engraving. One of these is a knight\r\nand lady on an altar tomb, the knight in plate armour with collar of\r\nSS, and the other the monument of a knight, also in collar of SS.\r\nBesides these are monuments and tablets to Sir John Curzon and Patience\r\nCrewe, his wife, 1604; Sir John Curzon, 1727; Nathaniel, second Lord\r\nScarsdale, 1837, and his lady, 1850; and many others to different\r\nmembers of the family, besides a fine canopy of a “founder’s tomb.”\r\n\r\nThe Church closely adjoins the hall, from which there is an entrance\r\ninto the churchyard. At the east end of the Church is a quaintly\r\ncurious sundial, bearing, above the dial itself, the words _We shall_,\r\nand thus reading—\r\n\r\n  WE SHALL\r\n    DIAL\r\n\r\n(the latter word, of course, not being there, but implied by the dial\r\nitself): the meaning is, “We shall die all,” or, “We shall all die.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Kedleston Church, Interior._]\r\n\r\nNot far from Kedleston are the picturesque ruins of Mackworth Castle,\r\nthe ancient stronghold of the De Mackworths, and in its neighbourhood\r\nare Quarndon, with its medicinal springs; Markeaton Hall, the seat of\r\nthe Mundys; Kirk Ireton, famous as the place from whence the two great\r\nParliamentary officers, General Ireton and Colonel Sanders, sprang;\r\nDuffield, once the stronghold and seat of the Norman family of Ferrars,\r\nEarls of Derby; Mugginton, anciently the seat of the Knivetons; and\r\nmany other places of note.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUDLEY END.\r\n\r\nOF the earlier life of Sir Thomas Audley, the founder of Audley End,\r\nor of the family from which he sprang, but little is known. His rise\r\nwas rapid, as his rapacity was great, and, like others in the very\r\nextraordinary times in which he lived, he fawned on his sovereign\r\nand preyed on the possessions of others until he had raised himself\r\nto a high position. “Thomas Audley,” says a writer in 1711, “being\r\na sedulous student in the law, became Autumne Reader to the Inner\r\nTemple, temp. Henry VIII., and was after chosen Speaker of the House\r\nof Commons, in the 21st of Henry VIII. In which station (this being\r\nthe parliament that gave the finishing hand to the dissolution of\r\nmonasteries) he was so acceptable to the king that he at first made\r\nhim Attorney of the Duchy of Lancaster, next Serjeant-at-Law, being\r\nafter the King’s Own Serjeant; and upon the resignation of the Lord\r\nChancellor More, he was knighted, made Lord Keeper of the Great Seal,\r\nand, before the end of the year, Lord Chancellor of England. And the\r\n30th of Henry VIII. sat as Steward upon the arraignment of Henry\r\nCourtney, Marquis of Exeter, for endeavouring to advance Cardinal Pole\r\nto the crown. And subtilly, at length, obtaining the great Abbey of\r\nWalden, in Essex, he was, in the 30th of Henry VIII., created Lord\r\nAudley of Walden, and died the 35th of Henry VIII., leaving issue by\r\nElizabeth his wife, daughter of Thomas Grey, Marquis of Dorset, only\r\ntwo daughters his heirs—Mary, who died unmarried; and Margaret, who\r\nbecame his sole heir, first married to the Lord Henry Dudley, and after\r\nto Thomas, Duke of Norfolk, as second wife, whose son by her, Thomas,\r\nEarl of Suffolk, Lord Treasurer of England, built upon the ruines of\r\nthe abby that stately fabrick at Walden, call’d Audley-End, in memory\r\nof this Lord Audley.”\r\n\r\nThomas Audley, who, as has just been stated, was the principal agent\r\nin the great work of spoliation, the dissolution of monasteries,\r\nwas rewarded for his zeal by grant after grant from the spoils, and\r\nyet was always, as is shown by his letters, whining and craving for\r\nmore. The rich priory of Christchurch, Aldgate, London, “with all the\r\nchurch plate and lands belonging to that house, was first granted to\r\nhim; and afterwards many portions of the estates previously belonging\r\nto the lesser religious houses of Essex, with licenses to alienate\r\nthem, of which he duly availed himself. Thus St. Botolph’s Priory, at\r\nColchester, with all its revenues, the Priory of the Crutched Friars,\r\nin the same town, and Tiltey Abbey, near Thaxted, were added to the\r\nlist of his monastic spoils, after the gifts from the king, in 1538,\r\non Sir Thomas’s application, of the rich Abbey of Walden, with all the\r\nestates, manors, and advowsons thereunto attached. He was also created\r\nLord Audley of Walden, and installed a Knight of the Garter. Yet,”\r\nsays the late Lord Braybrooke, “instead of Audley being contented with\r\nthese repeated marks of the royal favour, we are compelled to admit\r\nthat every grant which he obtained encouraged him to importune the king\r\nfor further recompense; and his letters, preserved in the Cottonian\r\nLibrary, prove that, in making these applications, he was mean enough\r\nto plead poverty as an excuse, and even to assert that his character\r\nhad suffered in consequence of the public services which he had been\r\nobliged to perform.”\r\n\r\nLord Audley, at his death in 1544, left two daughters, his\r\nco-heiresses; but the younger one dying in 1546, the eldest, Margaret\r\nAudley, became sole heiress to the estates. This lady was married\r\ntwice: first, at the age of fourteen, to Lord Henry Dudley, younger\r\nbrother to Lord Guildford Dudley, husband of the unfortunate Lady\r\nJane Grey, by whom she had no issue; and secondly, in 1557, to Thomas\r\nHoward, fourth Duke of Norfolk, as his second wife. She thus, the\r\ndaughter of one of the most aspiring men of the time, became allied to\r\nthe two most powerful and ambitious families in the kingdom—those of\r\nNorthumberland and Howard. By this second marriage, Margaret Audley\r\n(who died when only at the age of twenty-three) became the mother of\r\ntwo sons—Lord Thomas Howard, afterwards created Earl of Suffolk, of\r\nwhom we shall speak presently, and Lord William Howard, ancestor of the\r\nEarls of Carlisle, &c.—and two daughters, Elizabeth, who died in her\r\ninfancy, and Margaret, who became the wife of Robert Sackville, Earl of\r\nDorset.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Lodge._]\r\n\r\nThe elder of these sons, Thomas Howard, inherited Audley End and the\r\nother family estates from his mother. Having, by Act of Parliament,\r\n27th of Elizabeth, been restored in blood, he was, in 1588, knighted\r\nfor his gallant behaviour in the engagement with the Spanish Armada,\r\nand in 1597 was created Baron Howard of Walden. “He was a brave\r\nsea officer, and successively employed upon many trying occasions,\r\nsometimes as chief, sometimes as second in command, during that\r\nreign, and in particular contributed greatly to the reduction of the\r\ntown and castle of Cadiz.” In 1597 he was installed Knight of the\r\nGarter, and, according to some accounts, was made Constable of the\r\nTower. On the accession of James I., Lord Howard was, in 1603, sworn\r\na Privy Councillor, created Earl of Suffolk, and made one of the\r\nCommissioners for the office of Earl Marshal. In 1608 he was appointed\r\nLord Chamberlain, and in 1614 Lord High Treasurer of England. He it\r\nwas who, with Lord Monteagle, made the discovery of the Gunpowder Plot\r\nwhile performing the routine business pertaining to his office of Lord\r\nHigh Chamberlain on the 4th of November, 1605.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The West Front._]\r\n\r\nLord Suffolk was married twice: first, to Mary, sister and co-heiress\r\nof Thomas, Lord Dacres of Gillesland, by whom he had no issue; and,\r\nsecondly, to Elizabeth, daughter and co-heiress of Sir Henry Knevett,\r\nof Charlton, and widow of Richard, eldest son of Lord Rich, by whom he\r\nhad four daughters—viz. Elizabeth, who married successively William\r\nKnolles, Earl of Banbury, and Edward, Lord Vaux; Frances, married first\r\nto Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex, from whom she was divorced, and next\r\nto Robert Carr, Earl of Somerset, Margaret; and Catherine, married to\r\nWilliam Cecil, Earl of Salisbury—and eight sons, viz. Theophilus, who\r\nsucceeded him; Sir Thomas, who was created Earl of Berkshire, and is\r\nthe direct ancestor of the present Earl of Suffolk and Berkshire—the\r\nearldom of Suffolk having reverted to this branch in 1733—whose\r\ndescendants later on succeeded to the titles; Henry, who married\r\nElizabeth Bassett, of Blore, by whom he had a daughter, Elizabeth, who\r\nbecame successively the wife of Sir John Howard, of Swarkeston, in\r\nDerbyshire, and of William Cavendish, Duke of Newcastle; Sir Charles;\r\nSir Robert, “a gallant cavalier soldier, was but too notorious in his\r\nown day for his intrigue with the Viscountess Purbeck, the beautiful\r\nand ill-assorted daughter of the Chief Justice Coke;” Sir William; Sir\r\nJohn; and Sir Edward, who was created Baron Howard of Escrick.\r\n\r\nThe first Earl of Suffolk built the magnificent mansion of Audley\r\nEnd, over which he is stated to have expended the enormous sum, for\r\nthose days, of more than £190,000. It is said of him that although he\r\nhad, from his many high and lucrative offices and his large estates,\r\nmore ample means of displaying his magnificence than had any of his\r\nancestors, he eclipsed them all in extravagance and show. His wife,\r\nLady Suffolk, too, “was unfortunately a woman of a covetous mind, and\r\nhaving too great an ascendancy over her husband, used it in making him\r\na party to her extortions on persons who had business to transact at\r\nthe Treasury, or places to obtain at Court; and her husband was charged\r\nwith embezzlement, deprived of his office, and fined £30,000, but which\r\nwas reduced by the King to £7,000. He was generally considered to have\r\nbeen chiefly guilty in concealing the malpractices of his wife, who\r\neventually died in debt and difficulty.” Probably one great reason for\r\nthese things being laid to his charge was that, through having for\r\na son-in-law the fallen and disgraced courtier Robert Carr, Earl of\r\nSomerset, he had become obnoxious to the new favourite, Buckingham,\r\nthrough whose influence it appears he and his countess were, for a\r\nshort time, committed to the Tower. He died at Suffolk House (where\r\nSuffolk Street, Strand, now stands), in 1626, and was buried at Walden.\r\nHe was succeeded by his eldest son, Theophilus Howard (who during his\r\nfather’s lifetime had been summoned to Parliament as Lord Howard of\r\nWalden) as second Earl of Suffolk. He was a Knight of the Garter, Lord\r\nWarden, Chancellor, and Admiral of the Cinque Ports, Constable of Dover\r\nCastle, &c., and married Elizabeth, daughter and co-heiress of the Earl\r\nof Dunbar, by whom he had issue four sons and five daughters, three of\r\nthe sons becoming successively Earls of Suffolk.\r\n\r\nHe was succeeded by his son James (third Earl of Suffolk), who, like\r\nhis father, for a time resided at Audley End in quiet retirement. The\r\ncost of the building had so greatly involved the first earl that, at\r\nthe time of his committal to the Tower, he was about £40,000 in debt,\r\nalthough he had then but recently sold the Charter House to Mr. Sutton\r\nfor £13,000, and his property at Aynhoe, in Northamptonshire, for a\r\nconsiderable sum. The charges thus entailed on the estate, and the cost\r\nof maintaining it, so affected his successors that they were unable to\r\nsupport an establishment commensurate with the size and magnificence of\r\nthe house. After the Restoration, Earl James, therefore, gladly took\r\nthe opportunity which offered of selling the park and mansion of Audley\r\nEnd to the King, Charles II.\r\n\r\nThe purchase-money of this estate (which, as already stated, in\r\nbuilding alone had cost £190,000) was £50,000, of which but £30,000 was\r\npaid by the King, the remaining £20,000 being left on mortgage. This\r\nwas in 1666, and in 1670 the Court was regularly established at Audley\r\nEnd; the Queen very frequently resided there; and, being convenient for\r\nNewmarket, festivities were kept up on a large scale.\r\n\r\nAfter the sale of the house, the Earl of Suffolk and his successor,\r\nthe fourth earl, resided in comparative retirement, Audley End being,\r\nby the King, “committed to the charge of one of the family, who held\r\nthe office of housekeeper and keeper of the wardrobe, with a salary;\r\nand this arrangement continued till 1701, when the house and park were\r\nreconveyed” back to the Suffolk family. The £20,000 left on mortgage\r\ncontinued unpaid by the King at the revolution of 1688, “nor is it\r\nclear that any interest had ever been paid upon it” during the many\r\nyears it had remained. In 1701, therefore, the demesne was, as just\r\nstated, conveyed back to the Howards, the fifth Earl of Suffolk, on\r\nreceiving it, relinquishing his claim on the Crown for the debt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _East Front, from the Garden._]\r\n\r\nJames, the third Earl of Suffolk, already spoken of, married, first,\r\nSusan, daughter of the Earl of Holland, by whom he had an only\r\ndaughter, Essex, married to Edward, Lord Griffin of Braybrooke;\r\nsecondly, Barbara, daughter of Sir Edward Villiers and widow of Sir\r\nRichard Wenman, by whom he had a daughter, who became the wife of\r\nSir Thomas Felton; and, thirdly, to Anne, daughter of the Earl of\r\nManchester, by whom he had no issue. Dying in 1688, he was succeeded\r\nby his brother, George Howard, as fourth earl, who enjoyed the title\r\nonly three years; when, dying without surviving male issue, he was\r\nsucceeded by his brother, Henry Howard, as fifth earl. This nobleman\r\nmarried twice: first, Mary, daughter of Lord Castle Stewart, by whom\r\n(besides a daughter) he had three sons—Henry, Edward, and Charles—who\r\neach successively became Earl of Suffolk; and, secondly, the widow of\r\nSir John Maynard, by whom he had no issue. He died in 1709, and was\r\nsucceeded by his eldest son, Henry Howard, created in his father’s\r\nlifetime Baron Chesterford and Earl of Bindon, who was succeeded by\r\nhis eldest son, Charles William, as seventh Earl of Suffolk, and\r\nsecond Earl of Bindon and Baron of Chesterford. He married Elizabeth,\r\ndaughter of Sir Thomas Astrey, but had no issue; and, dying in 1721-2,\r\nthe titles of Baron of Bindon and Earl of Chesterford became extinct,\r\nwhile those of Earl of Suffolk and Baron Howard of Walden passed to his\r\nfather’s brother Edward, and, at his death, to _his_ brother Charles,\r\nas ninth earl. He dying in 1733, left one only son, Henry Howard, who\r\nthus became tenth Earl of Suffolk. This tenth earl married Sarah,\r\ndaughter of Thomas Irwin, but died without issue in 1745, his widow\r\nafterwards becoming the wife of Viscount Falkland.\r\n\r\nOn the death of the tenth earl, the title of Earl of Suffolk, &c.,\r\npassed to his distant relative, Henry Bowes Howard, Earl of Berkshire,\r\nViscount Andover, &c., who, descended from Sir Thomas Howard, second\r\nson of the first Earl of Suffolk, was direct ancestor of the present\r\nEarl of Suffolk and Berkshire, the barony of Howard de Walden remaining\r\nin abeyance between the descendants of the two co-heiresses of the\r\nthird earl.\r\n\r\nThese were, as already shown, Essex, wife of Edward, Lord Griffin\r\nof Braybrooke, and Elizabeth, wife of Sir Thomas Felton. The\r\nrepresentatives of the elder of these were the Hon. Elizabeth Griffin,\r\nmarried, first, to Henry Neville Grey, and, secondly, to the Earl\r\nof Portsmouth; and her sister, Ann, wife of William Whitwell. Lady\r\nPortsmouth having no issue by either of her husbands, the real descent\r\nlay with the son of Mrs. Whitwell, in whose favour the abeyance\r\nterminated, and who thus became Lord Howard of Walden. The possession\r\nof the Audley End estates was disputed by Thomas Howard, second Earl\r\nof Effingham, who claimed under a settlement in his favour, made by\r\nthe seventh Earl of Suffolk, who, however, having been proved to have\r\nhimself only been a tenant for life, the claim was disallowed, and\r\nthe estates passed to Lady Portsmouth, from whom, by bequest, they\r\nultimately came to John Griffin Whitwell, Lord Howard of Walden.\r\n\r\nThis nobleman was created Baron Braybrooke in 1788, with remainder to\r\nhis relative, Richard Neville, whose father, Richard Aldworth, was\r\nmaternally descended from the Nevilles; and, dying without issue,\r\nthe title of Lord Howard of Walden passed to a distant descendant of\r\nthat family. He was succeeded, as second Baron Braybrooke, in 1797,\r\nby this Richard Neville, who assumed the name of Griffin. He married,\r\nin 1780, Catherine, daughter of the Right Hon. George Grenville, who\r\nwas maternally descended from Theophilus, second Earl of Suffolk,\r\nand sister of the first Marquis of Buckingham, and had by her,\r\nbesides other issue, the Hon. Richard, who succeeded him, and who, by\r\narrangement with the deceased peer’s only sister and heiress (wife of\r\nthe Rev. Dr. Parker), obtained immediate possession of the mansion and\r\nunentailed portion of the estate, the other portion coming to him at\r\nthe death, without issue, of that lady.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _South Front._]\r\n\r\nRichard, third Baron Braybrooke, born in 1783, succeeded his father\r\nin 1825, and married the Lady Jane, eldest daughter of Charles,\r\nMarquis Cornwallis, by whom he had issue five sons—Richard Cornwallis\r\nNeville, Charles Cornwallis Neville, Henry Aldworth Neville, Rev.\r\nLatimer Neville (now Master of Magdalen College, Cambridge, and\r\nheir-presumptive to the title), and Grey Neville—and three daughters.\r\nLord Braybrooke was well known as the author of the “History of Audley\r\nEnd,” and as the editor of the “Diary and Correspondence of Samuel\r\nPepys.” He was succeeded by his eldest son, Richard Cornwallis Neville\r\n(better known as the Hon. R. C. Neville), as fourth Baron Braybrooke.\r\nThis nobleman, who was born in 1820, was an eminent antiquary, and was\r\nauthor of several important works. He was educated at Eton, and in\r\n1837 entered the army, serving in Canada till 1838. Ill-health, which\r\ncontinued throughout his life, compelled him to retire from the army\r\nin 1841, and he devoted himself thenceforward to the study of history\r\nand antiquities. He became a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries,\r\na member of other learned bodies, and contributed many papers to\r\nthe _Archæologia_ and to the _Transactions of the Archæological\r\nAssociation_ and _Institute_. Having undertaken and carried out some\r\nimportant excavations at Chesterford, &c., he published his “Antiqua\r\nExplorata,” which afterwards he followed by another volume, “Sepulchra\r\nExposita.” In 1852 he issued his great work, “Saxon Obsequies;” and,\r\nlater still, the “Romance of the Ring; or, the History and Antiquity\r\nof Finger Rings.” His lordship married, in 1852, the Lady Charlotte\r\nSarah Graham Toler, sixth daughter of the second Earl of Norbury (who\r\nafterwards married Frederick Hetley, Esq., and died in 1867), by\r\nwhom he left two daughters, and, dying in 1861, was succeeded by his\r\nbrother, the Hon. Charles Cornwallis Neville, the present peer.\r\n\r\nCharles Cornwallis Neville, fifth Baron Braybrooke, was born in 1823,\r\nand educated at Eton and at Magdalen College, Cambridge, of which he\r\nis Hereditary Visitor. In 1849 he married the Hon. Florence Priscilla\r\nAlicia Maude, third daughter of the third Viscount Hawarden, by whom\r\nhe has issue one daughter, the Hon. Augusta Neville, born 1860. The\r\nheir-presumptive to the title is, therefore, his brother, the Rev.\r\nLatimer Neville, Master of Magdalen College, Cambridge, and Chaplain\r\nto the Bishop of Rochester, who is married to Lucy Frances, eldest\r\ndaughter of John Le Marchant, Esq., by whom he has issue.\r\n\r\nLord Braybrooke is patron of seven livings—viz. Arborfield, Waltham\r\nSt. Lawrence, and Wargrave, in Berkshire; Shadingfield, in Sussex;\r\nand Littlebury, Saffron Walden, and Heydon, in Essex. His arms\r\nare—quarterly, first and fourth, _gules_, on a saltire, _argent_,\r\na rose of the field; second and third, _or_, fretty, _gules_, on a\r\ncanton of the first, a lymphad, _sable_. Crests—first, a rose, seeded\r\nand barbed, _proper_; second, out of a ducal coronet, _or_, a bull’s\r\nhead; third, a portcullis, _proper_. Supporters—two lions reguardant,\r\n_argent_, maned, _sable_, gorged with wreaths of olive, _proper_.\r\nMotto—“Ne vile velis.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Entrance Porch, West Front._]\r\n\r\nThe history of Audley End has been pretty fully told in the history of\r\nthe families to whom it has belonged; but little, therefore, need be\r\nadded. The architect of the mansion has been variously stated to be\r\nBernard Jansen and John Thorpe, but the weight of evidence seems to be\r\nin favour of the latter. Regarding the house itself, and especially\r\nthe “admirable drink” kept in the cellar, we have two striking\r\npictures written by “quaint old Pepys” in 1659-60 and 1667. “Up by\r\nfour o’clock,” he says on the 27th February, “Mr. Blayton and I took\r\nhorse and straight to Saffron Walden, where, at the White Hart, we set\r\nup our horses, and took the master of the house to show us Audley End\r\nHouse, who took us on foot through the park, and so to the house, where\r\nthe housekeeper showed us all the house, in which the stateliness of\r\nthe ceilings, chimney-pieces, and form of the whole was exceedingly\r\nworth seeing. He took us into the cellar, where we drank most admirable\r\ndrink, a health to the king. Here I played on my flageolette, there\r\nbeing an excellent echo. He shewed us excellent pictures; two\r\nespecially, those of the Four Evangelists, and Henry VIII. After that I\r\ngave the man 2_s._ for his trouble and went back again. In our going,\r\nmy landlord carried us through a very old hospital, or almshouse, where\r\nforty poor people was maintained; a very old foundation: and over the\r\nchimney-piece was an inscription in brass, ‘Orate pro animâ Thomæ\r\nBird,’ &c., and the poor-box also was on the same chimney-piece, with\r\nan iron door and locks to it, into which I put 6_d._ They brought me\r\na draft of their drink in a brown bowl tipt with silver,[45] which I\r\ndrank off, and at the bottom was a picture of the Virgin and the Child\r\nin her arms, done in silver. So we went to our Inn, and after eating of\r\nsomething, and kissed the daughter of the house, she being very pretty,\r\nwe took leave, and so that night, the road pretty good, but the weather\r\nrainy, to Epping, where we sat and played a game at cards, and after\r\nsupper and some merry talk with a playne bold mayde of the house we\r\nwent to bed.” Again, in 1667, he says: “I and my wife and Willet (the\r\nmaid), set out in a coach I have hired with four horses, and W. Hewer\r\nand Murford rode by us on horseback; and before night come to Bishop’s\r\nStortford. Took coach to Audley End, and did go all over the house and\r\ngardens; and mighty merry we were. The house indeed do appear very\r\nfine, but not so fine as it hath heretofore to me; particularly, the\r\nceilings are not so good as I always took them to be, being nothing\r\nso well wrought as my Lord Chancellor’s are; and though the figure of\r\nthe house without be very extraordinary good, yet the stayre-case is\r\nexceeding poore; and a great many pictures, and not one good one in the\r\nhouse but one of Henry VIII., done by Holbein; and not one good suit of\r\nhangings in all the house, but all most ancient things, such as I would\r\nnot give the hanging up of in my house; and the other furniture, beds,\r\nand other things, accordingly. Only the gallery is good, and above all\r\nthings the cellars, where we went down and drank of much good liquor.\r\nAnd indeed the cellars are fine: and here my wife and I did sing to my\r\ngreat content. And then to the garden, and there eat many grapes, and\r\ntook some with us; and so away thence exceeding well satisfied, though\r\nnot to that degree that by my old esteem of the house I ought and did\r\nexpect to have done, the situation of it not pleasing me; thence away\r\nto Cambridge, and did take up at the Rose.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Temple of Concord._]\r\n\r\nEvelyn, who wrote a little before Pepys—in 1654—says he “went to\r\nAudley End, and spent some time in seeing that goodly palace, built\r\nby Howard, Earl of Suffolk, once Lord Treasurer. It is a mixed fabric\r\n‘twixt ancient and modern, but observable for its being completely\r\nfinished; and it is one of the stateliest palaces in the kingdom. It\r\nconsists of two courts, the first very large, winged with cloisters.\r\nThe front hath a double entrance; the hall is faire, but somewhat too\r\nsmall for so august a pile; the kitchen is very large, as are the\r\ncellars, arched with stone, very neat, and well disposed. These offices\r\nare joyned by a wing out of the way very handsomely. The gallery is\r\nthe most cheerful, and, I think, one of the best in England; a faire\r\ndining-roome and the rest of the lodginges answerable, with a pretty\r\nchapel. The gardens are not in order, though well inclosed; it has also\r\na bowling-alley, and a nobly walled, wooded, and watered park. The\r\nriver glides before the palace, to which is an avenue of lime-trees;\r\nbut all this is much diminished by its being placed in an obscure\r\nbottom. For the rest it is perfectly uniform, and shows without like\r\na diadem, by the decoration of the cupolas and other ornaments on the\r\npavilions. Instead of railings and ballusters, there is a bordure of\r\ncapital letters, as was lately also in Sussex House.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Garden._]\r\n\r\nIn 1721, on the advice of that man of little taste, Sir John Vanbrugh\r\nthe architect, the three sides of the grand quadrangle, which formed\r\nso magnificent an entrance to this splendid mansion, were destroyed,\r\nalong with the kitchen and offices, which were behind the north wing.\r\nThe chapel and cellars, which projected from the gallery wing at\r\neach end, soon shared the same fate. The inner court thus was alone\r\nallowed to remain untouched, and the mansion was confined to one hollow\r\nsquare. In 1747 the house was in a state of dilapidation, and projects\r\nwere set on foot both for pulling it down, and for converting it into\r\na silk manufactory. Two years later, the eastern wing, whose feature\r\nwas the magnificent gallery, was pulled down. The house was, at an\r\nenormous expense, restored, repaired, and made habitable by the first\r\nLord Braybrooke, and, though there remains but a small portion of the\r\noriginal edifice, it is yet a noble and stately building.\r\n\r\nWe have left ourselves scant space for a description of the noble and\r\nvery beautiful house, one of the best of those of the Elizabethan\r\nera that time has left us, though it is not now as it was when\r\nEvelyn pictured it in the quotation we have given; but the gardens\r\nare charmingly kept, and have been laid out with taste and skill;\r\nthe classic river Cam runs in front, and it is here of considerable\r\nbreadth, Art having utilised the small stream, and made what is\r\ntechnically termed “a sheet of ornamental water;” it is also used to\r\nsupply fountains and _jets d’eau_ in various parts of the grounds.\r\n\r\nThe house is distant about a mile from the pretty and picturesque\r\ntown of Saffron Walden, whose Church holds rank among four of the\r\nmost perfect examples in Great Britain; and close to it is a Museum\r\ncontaining much that is deeply interesting—many specimens of the\r\nearliest races by whom this island was inhabited in the pre-historic\r\nages.\r\n\r\nWe give several engravings of the house; one of its principal Lodge,\r\none of its attractive Gardens, and one of a comparatively modern\r\nstructure in the grounds, called the Temple of Concord, built, it\r\nis said, to commemorate the recovery of George III. from his first\r\nafflicting illness.\r\n\r\nBefore we reach the house, proceeding from the Audley End station, we\r\nmay pause awhile to examine the Abbey Farm-buildings and a square of\r\nvenerable and very comfortable Almshouses, in which “nine old ladies”\r\nare passing in ease the residue of their lives—blessing, as we bless,\r\nthe lord who founded them.\r\n\r\nThe grand feature of the house is the Hall: it is not, as Evelyn\r\nthought it was, “somewhat too small,” but is finely proportioned, in\r\nsome parts admirably carved, and it contains many portraits—among\r\nothers that of the founder and his wife and daughter. The ceilings\r\nthroughout the mansion are of much beauty, and, besides several grand\r\nexamples of the ancient masters and “throngs” of family portraits,\r\nthere are some rare specimens of china. There are other curious\r\nrelics—among them the chair of Alexander Pope, and the carved oak head\r\nof Cromwell’s bed, converted into a chimney-piece.\r\n\r\nAudley End is not often visited: it is somewhat out of the highway of\r\nEngland, but of a surety it will largely repay those who love Nature\r\nand appreciate Art, and who rejoice that one of the grandest and most\r\nbeautiful of our landmarks of family history is yet in its perfection\r\nand thoroughly “well cared for.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBURLEIGH.\r\n\r\n\r\n“BURLEIGH HOUSE by Stamford town,” as Tennyson has it in his simple\r\nand beautiful ballad, “The Lord of Burleigh,” stands in a noble\r\npark just outside the fine old town of Stamford. Stamford is in\r\ntwo counties—Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire—on the river\r\nWelland, which here divides them, and at the same time separates six\r\nparishes, five being in Lincolnshire, and the sixth, St. Martin’s,\r\nor Stamford-Baron, in Northamptonshire. In this latter county are\r\nBurleigh House and its surrounding demesne. The park for pedestrians is\r\nconveniently entered at Burleigh Lane, one of the outer streets of the\r\ntown; thus the grounds, being so ready of access, are an incalculable\r\nboon to the inhabitants. The principal Lodges are on the North Road,\r\nimmediately south of St. Martin’s, and are noble and important\r\nbuildings, erected in 1801 at a cost of more than £5,000, by the tenth\r\nearl, the approach being greatly improved in 1828 by his immediate\r\nsuccessor.\r\n\r\nThe park, nearly seven miles in circumference, was planted by\r\n“Capability Brown,” and besides its attractions of wood and temples,\r\ngrottoes and other buildings, contains a fine sheet of water\r\nthree-quarters of a mile in length, spanned by a handsome bridge of\r\nthree arches, with noble sculptures of lions. The Roman road, Ermine\r\nStreet, may be traced in some parts of the park on its way from Caistor\r\nto Stamford. The park, which contains about fourteen hundred acres,\r\nwas principally laid out by the first Lord Burleigh, but has been\r\nsince then considerably extended and improved, one of the greatest\r\nimprovements being the filling up of the fish-pond, and the formation\r\nof the serpentine lake on the south front. The house is a mile distant\r\nfrom the Grand Lodge entrance, the approach being, for a considerable\r\ndistance, among magnificent oak and other forest trees, through\r\nbeautiful upland scenery.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Edward the Confessor, Burleigh (variously spelled\r\nBurleigh, Burghley, and Burley) was let to farm by the Church at Burgh\r\nto Alfgar, the King’s chaplain, at whose death it was seized by the\r\nCrown, and afterwards redeemed for eight marks by Abbot Leofric, and\r\nwas confirmed to Peterborough Abbey in 1146. At the time of taking the\r\nDomesday survey it was held of the Abbot of Peterborough by Goisfrid.\r\nIn the reign of Henry III. it is stated to have been in like manner\r\nheld by Thomas de Burghley, who died in 1280, and remained in that\r\nfamily for two or three generations. “Peter de Burlegh, it appears,”\r\nsays Sharpe, “held possession here in the twenty-fourth of Edward I.,\r\nand obtained a grant of free warren in the third of Edward II. Geoffry,\r\nhis son, succeeded him, but, dying without issue, his widow, Mariot,\r\nmarried John de Tichmersh, who, in her right, held the manor in the\r\nthird of Edward III., and continued to do so until the twentieth year\r\nof the same reign.” Somewhat later it is said to have belonged to\r\nNicholas de Segrave, it “having descended to Alice de Lisle as part\r\nof the inheritance of John de Armenters. From Nicholas de Segrave it\r\npassed to Warine de Lisle, who, with others, took up arms against the\r\nking, was defeated at Borough Bridge, and executed at Pontefract.\r\nBy Edward III., Gerard de Lisle, son of Warine, was restored to his\r\nfather’s possessions, and held Burleigh with the other estates.” In\r\n1360, Sharpe states, Burleigh was in the possession of Robert Wykes,\r\none of whose descendants, Margaret Chambers, sold it to Richard Cecil,\r\nfather of the Lord Treasurer, who also purchased the adjoining manor of\r\nLittle Burleigh.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Burleigh House, from the Park._]\r\n\r\nThe present mansion was commenced in 1575 by the first Lord Burleigh,\r\nwhose principal residence was, however, at Theobalds, in Hertfordshire.\r\nThe old structure was mainly retained, the existing portions being “in\r\nthe eastern part of the present building, and are exceedingly fine and\r\nsubstantial; they are—the kitchen, with a groined roof of vast extent\r\nand most peculiar construction (perhaps the largest apartment in Europe\r\ndevoted to culinary purposes); the imposing banqueting-hall, with its\r\nmagnificent bay window and open carved roof, surpassed by only one\r\nother in England (Westminster); and the chapel, reached by a unique\r\nvaulted stone staircase, elaborately ornamented, and remarkable for its\r\nradiating arch.” The building, when completed and finished, was said to\r\nbe the most complete and splendid in the kingdom. It is recorded that\r\nwhen, in the civil wars, Burleigh was taken by the Parliamentarians,\r\nCromwell and his officers and army behaved with the utmost\r\nconsideration and courtesy to the family. Cromwell himself, “when he\r\nbeheld it (Burlegh), forgot his rage for destruction, and, charmed with\r\nits magnificence, displayed his republican generosity by depositing\r\nhis own picture (by Walker) among those of its fine collection.” It is\r\nalso recorded that later on, William III., when he saw Burleigh, “with\r\na jealousy and a littleness of spirit unworthy of a monarch, declared\r\nthat it was much too gorgeous for a subject.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _West View._]\r\n\r\nQueen Elizabeth delighted to visit Burleigh; and we read that “twelve\r\ntimes did he (Lord Treasurer Cecil) entertain the Queen at his house\r\nfor several weeks together, at an expense of £2,000 or £3,000 each\r\ntime.” It is traditionally said that on one of her visits, when the\r\nLord Treasurer was pointing out its beauties to Elizabeth, her Majesty,\r\ntapping him familiarly on the cheek, said to him, “Ay, _my_ money and\r\n_your_ taste have made it a mighty pretty place!” Burleigh was, in\r\n1603, visited by King James I. on his way from Scotland, and in 1695\r\nby King William III. The most magnificent royal visit was, however,\r\nthat of Queen Victoria with the Prince Consort in 1842, when she was\r\naccompanied by her ministers and the Court.\r\n\r\nThe family of Cecil seems to be derived from Robert ap Seisylt, or\r\nSitsilt, or Seisel, a Welsh chieftain, who, in 1091, assisted Robert\r\nFitzhamon in his conquest of Glamorganshire, for which he received a\r\ngrant of lands in that county. Without entering particularly into the\r\ngenealogy of the early members of this family, it will be sufficient\r\nfor our present purpose to say that fifteenth in succession from this\r\nRobert ap Seisylt was David Sicelt, who, having joined the Earl of\r\nRichmond (Henry VII.) in Brittany, was rewarded for his service by a\r\ngrant of land in Lincolnshire. Under Henry VIII. he “was constituted\r\nWater Bailiff of Wittlesey, in the county of Huntingdon, as also\r\nKeeper of the Swans there and throughout all the waters and fens in\r\nthe counties of Huntingdon, Cambridge, Lincoln, and Northampton for\r\nthe term of thirty years; also, in the fifth of Henry VIII., he was\r\nmade one of the King’s Sergeants-at-arms; and, having this employment\r\nat court, obtained for Richard, his son and heir, the office of a page\r\nto the Crown. Likewise, in the eighth of Henry VIII., he obtained a\r\ngrant for himself and son of the Keepership of Clyff Park, in the\r\ncounty of Northampton; and in the fifteenth of Henry VIII. (continuing\r\nstill Sergeant-at-arms) was constituted Sheriff of the King’s Lordship\r\nof Coly Weston, in that county; and was Escheator of the county of\r\nLincoln from November 15th, 1529, to November 15th following. In the\r\ntwenty-third of Henry VIII. he was constituted Sheriff of Northampton;\r\nand having been three times Alderman of Stamford,” departed this life\r\nin the year 1541. He married the heiress of John Dicons, of Stamford,\r\nby whom he had a son, Richard Cecil, who succeeded him.\r\n\r\nThis Richard Cecil, as a page, attended Henry VIII. at the Field of\r\nthe Cloth of Gold, and afterwards became Groom and Yeoman of the\r\nRobes, Constable of Warwick Castle, Bailiff of Whittlesea Mere, with\r\nthe custody of swans, and steward of several manors. He purchased the\r\nmanors of Burleigh and Little Burleigh, and had grants of land at\r\nMaxey, Stamford, &c. He married Jane, daughter and heiress of William\r\nHeckington, of Bourn, by whom he had, with other issue, a son, William\r\nCecil, the famous Lord Treasurer.\r\n\r\nThis William Cecil, first Lord Burleigh, was born in 1520 at his\r\nmother’s house at Bourn, and early received marks of royal favour under\r\nHenry VIII. Under Edward VI. and Queen Elizabeth he held, with other\r\noffices, that of Secretary of State; and by the latter was made Lord\r\nHigh Treasurer of England, and created Baron Burleigh of Burleigh, and\r\ninstalled a Knight of the Garter. His lordship remained Lord Treasurer\r\nuntil within a few days of his death in 1598. Lord Burleigh married\r\ntwice, each time gaining a large increase both to his fortunes and to\r\nhis social and political influence. His first wife, to whom he was\r\nmarried in 1541, was Mary, sister of Sir John Cheke, who, within a year\r\nof their marriage, died, after giving birth to his son and successor,\r\nThomas Cecil. In 1545 he married, secondly, Mildred, daughter of Sir\r\nAnthony Cooke, by whom he had, with numerous other issue, a son, Robert\r\nCecil, who was created Earl of Salisbury, and was the progenitor of\r\nthe present Marquis of Salisbury. Lord Burleigh died in 1598, and was\r\nsucceeded by his son—\r\n\r\nThomas Cecil, second Baron Burleigh, who held many important offices,\r\nand was, by King James I., in 1605, created Earl of Exeter. He married,\r\nfirst, Dorothea, one of the co-heiresses of John Nevil, Lord Latimer,\r\nand by her had issue five sons—viz. William, who succeeded him; Sir\r\nRichard, whose son David also became Earl of Exeter; Sir Edward, who\r\nwas created Baron Cecil of Putney and Viscount Wimbledon; Christopher;\r\nand Thomas—and eight daughters. Lord Burleigh married, secondly, a\r\ndaughter of the fourth Lord Chandos and widow of Sir Thomas Smith, by\r\nwhom he had issue one daughter.\r\n\r\nWilliam Cecil, third Baron Burleigh and second Earl of Exeter, married,\r\nfirst, Elizabeth, only child of Edward, Earl of Rutland, by whom he had\r\nissue an only child, William Cecil, who, in his mother’s right, became\r\nBaron Roos, but who died without issue in his father’s lifetime; and,\r\nsecondly, Elizabeth, daughter of Sir William Drury. Dying in 1640, he\r\nwas succeeded by his nephew, David Cecil, as fourth Baron Burleigh and\r\nthird Earl of Exeter; he married Elizabeth, daughter of John, Earl of\r\nBridgewater; and, dying in 1643, was succeeded by his son, John Cecil,\r\nwho was only fifteen years old at his father’s death. He married,\r\nfirst, Lady Frances Manners, daughter of the Earl of Rutland; and,\r\nsecondly, Lady Mary, daughter of the Earl of Westmoreland and widow\r\nof Sir Bryan Palmes. By his first wife he had issue one son, John,\r\nwho succeeded him; David, who died young; and a daughter, Frances,\r\nmarried to Viscount Scudamore. He died in 1687, aged fifty-nine, and\r\nwas buried at Stamford. John Cecil, who succeeded his father as sixth\r\nBaron Burleigh and fifth Earl of Exeter, espoused Lady Anne Cavendish,\r\nonly daughter of the Earl of Devonshire and sister of the first Duke\r\nof Devonshire (widow of Lord Rich), by whom he had issue, John, who\r\nsucceeded him, and other children.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _North View._]\r\n\r\nJohn Cecil, seventh baron and sixth earl, married, first, Annabella,\r\ndaughter of Lord Ossulston; and, secondly, Elizabeth, daughter and\r\nco-heiress of Sir John Brownlow, by whom he had, with other issue,\r\nJohn and Brownlow, who succeeded as seventh and eighth earls. He died\r\nin 1721. John Cecil, his eldest son, who succeeded on his father’s\r\ndeath in 1721 as seventh earl and eighth baron, died unmarried in 1722,\r\nwhen the titles and estates devolved on his brother, Brownlow Cecil,\r\nwho thus became ninth Baron Burleigh and eighth Earl of Exeter. This\r\nnobleman married, in July, 1724, Hannah Sophia, daughter and heiress of\r\nThomas Chambers, of Derby and London, a beautiful and amiable woman,\r\nto whom a monument is erected in the gardens, bearing the following\r\ntouching lines:—\r\n\r\n  “Oh, thou most loved, most valued, most revered,\r\n    Accept this tribute to thy memory due;\r\n  Nor blame me, if by each fond tie endeared,\r\n    I bring again your virtues unto view.\r\n\r\n  “These lonely scenes your memory shall restore,\r\n    Here oft for thee the silent tear be shed;\r\n  Beloved through life, till life can charm no more,\r\n    And mourned till filial piety be dead.”\r\n\r\nBy this lady, who died in 1765, aged sixty-three, the Earl had issue\r\nthree sons—Brownlow Cecil, ninth Earl of Exeter; Thomas Chambers\r\nCecil, whose son ultimately became tenth earl; and David Cecil—and two\r\ndaughters, viz. Margaret Sophia and Elizabeth (who became the wife of\r\nJohn Chaplin, Esq.). His lordship died in 1754, and was succeeded by\r\nhis son.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _East View._]\r\n\r\nBrownlow Cecil, tenth baron and ninth earl, succeeded to the titles and\r\nestates in 1754, and having married Letitia, only daughter and heiress\r\nof the Hon. Horatio Townsend, he died without issue in 1793, and was\r\nsucceeded in his title and estates by his nephew, Henry Cecil, only son\r\nof the Hon. Thomas Chambers Cecil, by his wife, Charlotte Garnier.\r\n\r\nHenry Cecil, eleventh Baron Burleigh, tenth Earl of Exeter, and first\r\nMarquis of Exeter, was born at Brussels in 1754, and for many years in\r\nhis early life was M.P. for Stamford. His lordship was married three\r\ntimes: first, to Emma, only daughter and heiress of Thomas Vernon,\r\nEsq., of Hanbury, from whom he was divorced in 1791, after having issue\r\nby her one son, Henry, who died young; secondly, to Sarah, daughter\r\nto Thomas Hoggins, of Bolas, Shropshire, by whom he had issue four\r\nchildren, viz. the Lady Sophia Cecil, married to the Hon. Henry Manvers\r\nPierrepoint (whose daughter married Lord Charles Wellesley, second\r\nson of the first Duke of Wellington, and was mother of the present\r\nheir-presumptive to that dukedom); Lord Henry Cecil, who died young;\r\nLord Brownlow Cecil, who became second Marquis of Exeter; and Lord\r\nThomas Cecil, who married Lady Sophia Georgiana Lennox; and, thirdly,\r\nto Elizabeth, Duchess of Hamilton, by whom he had no issue. The second\r\nof these three marriages has supplied a theme to many novelists and\r\ndramatists. They have used the poet’s license somewhat; but it is\r\ncertain that the bride and her family had no idea of the rank of the\r\nwooer until the Lord of Burleigh had wedded the peasant-girl. Thus\r\nMoore pictures Ellen, the “hamlet’s pride,” loving in poverty, leaving\r\nher home to seek uncertain fortune. Stopping at the entrance to a\r\nlordly mansion, blowing the horn with a chieftain’s air, while the\r\nporter bowed as he passed the gate, “she believed him wild,” when he\r\nsaid, “This castle is thine, and these dark woods all;” but “his words\r\nwere truth,” and “Ellen was Lady of Rosna Hall.”\r\n\r\nThe story is more accurately and more plaintively poetically told by\r\nthe Laureate Tennyson, who undoubtedly adheres more literally to fact\r\nwhen he describes the lady as bowed down to death by the heavy weight\r\nof honour laid upon her, “unto which she was not born.” Tennyson’s\r\nballad of “The Lord of Burleigh,” in which the story of the “village\r\nmaiden,” from her wooing when she was plain Sarah Hoggins to the time\r\nof her early death as Countess of Exeter, is so sweetly and touchingly\r\ntold, is too sadly beautiful to be omitted here. It is as follows:—\r\n\r\n  “In her ear he whispers gaily,\r\n    ‘If my heart by signs can tell,\r\n  Maiden, I have watched thee daily,\r\n    And I think thou lov’st me well.’\r\n\r\n  “She replies, in accents fainter,\r\n    ‘There is none I love like thee.’\r\n  He is but a landscape painter,\r\n    And a village maiden she.\r\n\r\n  “He to lips that fondly falter\r\n    Presses his without reproof,\r\n  Leads her to the village altar,\r\n    And they leave her father’s roof.\r\n\r\n  “‘I can make no marriage present,\r\n    Little can I give my wife,\r\n  Love will make our cottage pleasant\r\n    And I love thee more than life.’\r\n\r\n  “They by parks and lodges going,\r\n    See the lordly castles stand;\r\n  Summer woods about them blowing,\r\n    Made a murmur in the land.\r\n\r\n  “From deep thought himself he rouses,\r\n    Says to her that loves him well—\r\n  ‘Let us see these handsome houses,\r\n    Where the wealthy nobles dwell.’\r\n\r\n  “So she goes by him attended,\r\n    Hears him lovingly converse,\r\n  Sees whatever fair and splendid\r\n    Lay betwixt his home and hers.\r\n\r\n  “Parks with oak and chestnut shady,\r\n    Parks and order’d gardens great,\r\n  Ancient homes of lord and lady,\r\n    Built for pleasure and for state.\r\n\r\n  “All he shows her makes him dearer;\r\n    Evermore she seems to gaze\r\n  On that cottage growing nearer,\r\n    Where they twain will spend their days.\r\n\r\n  “Oh, but she will love him truly,\r\n    He shall have a cheerful home;\r\n  She will order all things duly,\r\n    When beneath his roof they come.\r\n\r\n  “Thus her heart rejoices greatly,\r\n    Till a gateway she discerns,\r\n  With armorial bearings stately,\r\n    And beneath the gate she turns;\r\n\r\n  “Sees a mansion more majestic\r\n    Than all those she saw before;\r\n  Many a gallant gay domestic\r\n    Bows before him at the door.\r\n\r\n  “And they speak in gentle murmur,\r\n    When they answer to his call,\r\n  While he treads with footstep firmer,\r\n    Leading on from hall to hall.\r\n\r\n  “And, while now she wonders blindly,\r\n    Nor the meaning can divine,\r\n  Proudly turns he round and kindly,\r\n    ‘All of this is mine and thine.’\r\n\r\n  “Here he lives in state and bounty,\r\n    Lord of Burleigh, fair and free,\r\n  Not a lord in all the county,\r\n    Is so great a lord as he.\r\n\r\n  “All at once the colour flushes\r\n    Her sweet face from brow to chin;\r\n  As it were with shame she blushes,\r\n    And her spirit changed within.\r\n\r\n  “Then her countenance all over,\r\n    Pale again as death doth prove;\r\n  But he clasp’d her like a lover,\r\n    And he cheer’d her soul with love.\r\n\r\n  “So she strove against her weakness,\r\n    Tho’ at times her spirits sank,\r\n  Shaped her heart with woman’s meekness\r\n    To all duties of her rank.\r\n\r\n  “And a gentle consort made he,\r\n    And her gentle mind was such,\r\n  That she grew a noble lady,\r\n    And the people loved her much.\r\n\r\n  “But a trouble weigh’d upon her,\r\n    And perplex’d her night and morn,\r\n  With the burthen of an honour\r\n    Unto which she was not born.\r\n\r\n  “Faint she grew, and even fainter,\r\n    As she murmur’d, ‘Oh, that he\r\n  Were once more that landscape painter,\r\n    Which did win my heart from me.’\r\n\r\n  “So she droop’d and droop’d before him,\r\n    Fading slowly from his side;\r\n  Three fair children first she bore him,\r\n    Then before her time she died.\r\n\r\n  “Weeping, weeping late and early,\r\n    Walking up and pacing down,\r\n  Deeply mourn’d the Lord of Burleigh,\r\n    Burleigh House by Stamford town.\r\n\r\n  “And he came to look upon her.\r\n    And he look’d at her and said,\r\n  ‘Bring the dress and put it on her\r\n    That she wore when she was wed.’\r\n\r\n  “Then her people, softly treading,\r\n    Bore to earth her body, drest\r\n  In the dress that she was wed in,\r\n    That her spirit might have rest.”\r\n\r\nThe Countess, whose story is thus so plaintively told, died on the 18th\r\nof January, 1797, at the early age of twenty-four, and her portrait,\r\npreserved in the house, cannot but interest every visitor. The Earl,\r\nher husband, was in February, 1801, advanced to the dignity of Marquis\r\nof Exeter, and in May, 1804, he died, and was succeeded by his son by\r\nthis romantic and happy, though brief, espousal.\r\n\r\nThis son, Brownlow Cecil, second Marquis and eleventh Earl of Exeter,\r\nand twelfth Baron Burleigh, was only nine years of age when, on the\r\ndeath of his father in 1804, he succeeded to the titles and estates. In\r\n1824 his lordship married Isabella, daughter of William Stephen Poyntz,\r\nEsq., by whom he had issue eleven children—viz. William Alleyne, Lord\r\nBurleigh, the present Marquis of Exeter; a daughter, born in 1826; Lord\r\nBrownlow Thomas Montague Cecil; Lady Isabella Mary Cecil, who died in\r\ninfancy; Lady Mary Frances Cecil, married to Viscount Sandon, M.P.,\r\nheir to the earldom of Harrowby; Lord Edward Henry Cecil; Lady Dorothy\r\nAnne Cecil, who died in infancy; Lord Henry Poyntz Cecil; a son, who\r\ndied as soon as born; Lord Adelbert Percy Cecil, to whom Queen Adelaide\r\nstood as sponsor; and Lady Victoria Cecil, to whom her Most Gracious\r\nMajesty Queen Victoria and the Prince Consort were sponsors, married\r\nto the Hon. William Charles Evans-Freke, brother of Lord Carbery. His\r\nlordship died in 1867, and was succeeded by his son—\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Quadrangle, looking West._]\r\n\r\nThe present noble peer, William Alleyne Cecil, third Marquis and\r\ntwelfth Earl of Exeter, and thirteenth Baron Burleigh of Burleigh,\r\na Privy Councillor, and Hereditary Grand Almoner of England, who\r\nwas born on the 30th of April, 1825, and was educated at Eton and\r\nSt. John’s College, Cambridge, where he graduated as M.A. in 1847.\r\nHe sat as M.P. for South Lincolnshire from 1847 to 1857, and for\r\nNorth Northamptonshire from 1857 to 1867, in which year he succeeded\r\nto the titles, and took his seat in the Upper House. In 1856 he was\r\nappointed Militia Aide-de-camp to the Queen, and in 1866 was made\r\nTreasurer of her Majesty’s Household. In 1867 and 1868 he was Captain\r\nof her Majesty’s Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms, and he holds\r\nmany local and other appointments. His lordship married, in 1848,\r\nLady Georgiana Sophia Pakenham, second daughter of the second Earl\r\nof Longford, and has issue living—Brownlow Henry George Cecil, Lord\r\nBurleigh, born in 1849, and married to Isabella, daughter of Sir Thomas\r\nWhichcote, Bart.; Lord Francis Horace Pierrepoint Cecil, born 1851,\r\nmarried to Edith, youngest daughter of W. Cunliffe-Brooks, Esq., M.P.;\r\nLord William Cecil, born 1854; Lord John Pakenham Cecil, born 1867;\r\nLady Isabella Georgiana Katharine Cecil, born 1853; Lady Mary Louisa\r\nWellesley Cecil, born 1857; Lady Catherine Sarah Cecil, born 1861; Lady\r\nFrances Emily Cecil, born 1862; and Lady Louisa Alexandrina Cecil, born\r\n1864.\r\n\r\nHis lordship is patron of seventeen livings, five being in Rutland, one\r\nin London, and eleven in Northamptonshire and Lincolnshire.\r\n\r\nThe arms of the Marquis of Exeter, engraved on our initial letter,\r\nare—barry of ten, _argent_ and _azure_; six escutcheons, three, two,\r\nand one, _sable_, each charged with a lion rampant, _argent_. Crest—on\r\na chapeau, _gules_, turned up, _ermine_, a garb, _or_, supported\r\nby two lions rampant, the dexter _argent_, the sinister _azure_.\r\nSupporters—two lions, _ermine_. Motto—“Cor unum via una.” His seats\r\nare Burleigh, near Stamford, and Brookfield House, Ryde, in the Isle of\r\nWight.\r\n\r\nThe visitor to Burleigh House is admitted by the Porter’s Lodge into\r\nthe Outer Court, which is a quadrangle surrounded by the domestic\r\nand business offices of the establishment. He then passes into the\r\nCorridor, decorated with bas-reliefs by Nollekens, and so reaches the\r\nGreat Hall, or Queen Victoria’s Hall, a banqueting-room of magnificent\r\nsize and of matchless beauty, with open-work timber roof, stained-glass\r\nwindows, richly carved gallery, and royal and other portraits. This\r\nnoble apartment, shown in the accompanying engraving, which, with\r\nothers of our series, is taken from a photograph by F. Robinson, is 68\r\nfeet long, 60 feet in height, and 30 feet in width, with, in addition,\r\na deeply recessed bay window.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Great Hall._]\r\n\r\nIt has a magnificent open timber-work roof of carved oak, and the\r\nlower portions of the walls are wainscoted; and at one end is a\r\nmusic gallery, the cornice of the panelling and the gallery being\r\nsupported on a number of richly carved spiral Corinthian columns. The\r\nfire-place is remarkably fine, and the window is filled with stained\r\nglass. Among the pictures in the Hall are a portrait of the Prince\r\nConsort in his Garter robes, presented to the Marquis by the Prince;\r\nDahl’s full-length portraits of George I., George II., and the Queen\r\nof George II.; and portraits of Viscount and Viscountess Montague,\r\nEarl of Peterborough, Sir Walter Raleigh, &c. From the Hall, passing\r\nthrough Vestibule and Corridor, which contain busts of the Cæsars and\r\nother examples of sculpture, and the Ancient Stone Staircase—a part\r\nof the original building, shown in the opposite engraving—the Chapel\r\nis reached. The Chapel contains, among its other attractions, a fine\r\nassemblage of carving, said to be by Grinling Gibbons, and among the\r\nbest of his productions; an altar-piece by Paul Veronese, the subject\r\nbeing the “Wife of Zebedee;” the seat used by Queen Elizabeth when\r\nshe worshipped here, and used also for the same purpose by Queen\r\nVictoria; and many good paintings. The communion-table and altar-rails\r\nare of cedar-wood, and the pulpit and reading-desk of mahogany. The\r\nmagnificent chimney-piece of various marbles was brought from a\r\nconvent near Lisbon. The Ante-chapel is also an interesting room.\r\nThe Chapel-room contains many paintings by Carlo Dolce, Domenichino,\r\nLanfranco, Albert Dürer, Guercino, Andrea Sacchi, Parmigiano, the\r\nCarracci, Guido, Teniers, Bassan, Rubens, Carlo Maratti, Bolognese,\r\nGiulio Romano, Le Brun, and others.\r\n\r\nThe Billiard-room, panelled with Norway oak and enriched with a\r\ndecorated ceiling, is hung with family and other portraits. Among\r\nthem are Lawrence’s full-length group portraits of the tenth Earl and\r\nCountess—Sarah the “village maiden”—and their daughter, the Lady\r\nSophia; several other Earls and Countesses of Exeter, and others of\r\ntheir families; the first Duke and Duchess of Devonshire; Barbara\r\nVilliers, Duchess of Cleveland; Duchess of Montrose, &c.\r\n\r\nWe will not, however, go through the various rooms in the order in\r\nwhich they are visited, but select, here and there, an apartment for\r\nnotice, our object being, not to furnish a guide for the visitor’s use,\r\nbut to give a general sketch of the mansion and its surroundings.\r\n\r\nThe Ball-room has its walls and ceiling painted by Laguerre in his best\r\nstyle, the subject of the latter being described as the “History of the\r\nPlanetary System.” On the east side of the walls is painted “The Battle\r\nof Cannæ,” and on the west “The Continence of Scipio;” the others being\r\n“The Loves of Antony and Cleopatra,” &c. The Brown Drawing-room, lined\r\nwith oak, contains many valuable paintings as well as some exquisite\r\nexamples of Gibbons’s carvings, as also do the Black and Yellow\r\nBed-rooms. In this latter room is the ancient state bed from which it\r\ntakes its name. This is hung with black satin, ornamented with fine\r\nold needlework, and lined with yellow silk. In the windows is some good\r\nstained glass, and over the chimney-piece a fine example of Gibbons’s\r\ncarving. Among the paintings in this and the West and North-west\r\nDining-rooms are pictures by Guercino, old Franck, Libri, Angelica\r\nKauffmann, Rubens, Scilla, Cimabue, Giordano, the Carracci, Elsheimer,\r\nVan Balen, Salvator Rosa, Castiglione, G. Bolognese, Van Eyck, Murillo,\r\nClaude Lorraine, Domenichino, Mola, Jordaens, and others.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Ancient Stone Staircase._]\r\n\r\nIn the China Closet, besides several good paintings, a case of ceramic\r\ntreasures is preserved.\r\n\r\nQueen Elizabeth’s Bed-room is one of the most interesting apartments\r\nin the mansion, “and presents almost the same appearance as on the day\r\nwhen the great virgin queen first reposed therein—the very bed on\r\nwhich her royal form reclined, the same rich ancient tapestry which\r\nthen decorated the walls, and the same chairs which then furnished the\r\nroom, and upon some of which Elizabeth herself was once seated. The bed\r\nis hung with dark green velvet, embroidered with gold tissue, and the\r\nwalls are hung with tapestry representing Bacchus and Ariadne, Acis\r\nand Galatea, and Diana and Actæon.” Queen Elizabeth’s Dining-room,\r\nor the Pagoda Room, looks out upon the lawn, in the centre of which\r\nis a majestic and venerable tree planted by the “Virgin Queen,” the\r\n“Good Queen Bess,” herself. In this room are a Chinese pagoda and many\r\ninteresting portraits and other paintings. Among these are Shee’s\r\nportrait of the late marquis; Cranach’s head of Luther; Holbein’s Henry\r\nVIII., Thomas Cromwell, Edward VI., Queen Mary, Duke of Newcastle, and\r\nQueen Elizabeth; Mark Gerard’s Queen Elizabeth and the Lord Treasurer\r\nBurleigh; Zucchero’s Robert Devereux; Rembrandt’s Countess of Desmond;\r\nand admirable examples of Van Eyck, Annibale Carracci, Velasquez,\r\nTitian, Cranach, Paul Veronese, Cornelius Jansen, Dobsone, Vandyke, old\r\nStone, Dance, Romney, and others. The Purple Satin Rooms are also hung\r\nwith valuable paintings, and the furniture is of superb character.\r\n\r\nThe George Rooms, as a magnificent suite of five apartments, occupying\r\nthe south side of the mansion, are called, have the whole of their\r\nceilings painted with allegorical and mythological subjects by Verrio.\r\nThese are the apartments specially set aside for royalty, and have\r\nbeen repeatedly so occupied. The first George Room has its floor of\r\noak inlaid with walnut, and the carvings over the doors are among the\r\nbest existing examples of Gibbons. The Jewel Closet has a similar floor\r\nand equally good carvings; and in the centre, in a large glass case,\r\nare preserved numerous jewels and curiosities of great separate and\r\ncollective value. “Here are a plate of gold, a basin, and spoons, used\r\nby Queen Elizabeth at her coronation; a curiously ornamented busk, also\r\nused by Queen Elizabeth, and a jewelled crystal salt-cellar, supposed\r\nto have belonged to that great queen; a minute jewelled trinket sword,\r\nonce belonging to the unfortunate Mary Queen of Scots; a handkerchief\r\nof William III.; Cæsar’s head carved in onyx (a choice antique, 2½\r\ninches oval, and set in diamonds); Henry VIII. and his children cut in\r\nsardonyx; the head of the Lord Treasurer Burleigh on the back of an\r\nantique intaglio of Caracalla, depending from which is a small head\r\nof Elizabeth, both cameo on onyx. There are, besides, a multitude of\r\nenamelled trinkets, miniature vases in gold filigree, amber, diamonds,\r\nprecious stones, &c., &c. To this collection have been added, of late\r\nyears, a chrysanthemum wreath worn by Queen Victoria at the baptism of\r\nthe Lady Victoria Cecil, youngest daughter of the second marquis, and\r\na pair of white kid gloves worn by her Majesty at the same time: the\r\nwreath has been incrusted with metal by a process of electro-gilding,\r\nbut in effecting this it was broken into several pieces. There is\r\nalso a very elaborately ornamented trowel, used by Prince Albert,\r\nin 1842, in the ceremony of laying the first stone of the present\r\nbuilding of the Royal Exchange, London, and presented by him to the\r\nMarquis of Exeter, who attended his Royal Highness at the time as Groom\r\nof the Stole. There are also here a magnificent jewelled crucifix,\r\nseveral feet in height, and of great value, some rare china, and other\r\narticles. One other object remains to be noticed in this apartment:\r\nthis is a beautiful specimen of carving in white wood of a bird, nearly\r\nthe colour and about the size of a canary: it is represented as dead,\r\nhanging by one leg from a nail, and so exquisitely is it worked, that\r\nlooking upon it it is difficult to believe it merely the resemblance of\r\nreality.”\r\n\r\nThe State Bed-room, or second George Room, is the bed-room set apart\r\nfor the repose of royalty, and its furniture and decorations are of\r\ngreat richness. A magnificent bed was here erected by the then marquis,\r\nin preparation for a visit from George IV. when Prince of Wales, and\r\nwas subsequently several times used by various members of the royal\r\nfamily; but when Queen Victoria visited Burleigh in 1844, a bed even\r\nmore rich and costly was substituted, in which her Majesty and her\r\nroyal consort, Prince Albert, reposed during their stay. The hangings\r\nare of crimson velvet lined with white satin. The walls are hung with\r\nrare tapestry.\r\n\r\nThe State Dining-room, and the Great Drawing-room, or fourth George\r\nRoom, are gorgeous in the extreme, and filled to repletion with choice\r\nworks of Art and antiquity; while the fifth of these George apartments,\r\nnamed the Heaven, from the subjects of Verrio’s paintings, which cover\r\nalike the ceiling and walls, contains cabinets, paintings, and busts\r\nof great value. The whole of this suite of rooms is hung with choice\r\npictures, of which, of course, space prevents our giving an account.\r\nThe Grand Staircase, leading to the Great Hall, completes this suite;\r\nits ceiling is by Verrio, and the staircase and landings are adorned\r\nwith sculpture and paintings.\r\n\r\nWe regret that we cannot find space to describe the numerous other\r\nadmirably constructed and beautifully furnished apartments of this\r\nnoble mansion, one of the most interesting of the many glorious\r\nbaronial halls of the kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe burial-place of the family of Cecil is St. Martin’s Church,\r\nStamford, where many monuments exist; and the visitor will find much to\r\ninterest him in this and the other churches of that town.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEVER CASTLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEVER CASTLE was originally the stronghold of the family of De Hevre,\r\nsaid to have been of Norman extraction, one of whom, William De Hevre,\r\nis stated to have had license from King Edward III. to embattle this\r\nhis manor-house. His daughters and co-heiresses inherited the estates,\r\nand through them, by marriage, they were conveyed to the families of\r\nCobham and Brocas, the former of whom, having obtained the whole by\r\npurchase, sold it to Sir Geoffrey Bullen, or Boleyn, in which family it\r\nremained until it was seized by the Crown.\r\n\r\nThe family of Boleyn, or Bullen, traces from Sir Thomas Bullen, Knt.,\r\nof Blickling and Saul, in Norfolk, and Joan, his wife, daughter and\r\nheiress of Sir John Bracton, Knt. The grandson of Sir Thomas was Sir\r\nGeoffrey Bullen, the purchaser of Hever Castle and other estates of\r\nthe De Hevre family. Sir Geoffrey “was a wealthy mercer in London,\r\nas also Lord Mayor of that city in 37 Henry VI., and, having married\r\nAnne, eldest daughter and co-heiress to John, Baron Hoo and Hastings,\r\nby his second wife, Elizabeth, daughter and heiress of Sir Nicholas\r\nWichingham, he had issue, Sir William Bullen, Knight of the Bath at\r\nthe coronation of King Richard III.” Sir William married Margaret,\r\ndaughter and co-heiress of Thomas Butler, Earl of Ormond (third brother\r\nto James, Earl of Wiltshire), and by her had, with other issue, a son,\r\nThomas Bullen, afterwards created Earl of Wiltshire and Ormond.\r\n\r\nThis Thomas Bullen, or Boleyn, whose career, and that of his\r\nunfortunate daughter, Queen Anne Boleyn, are so intimately woven into\r\nthe history of our country, was, in 1496, in arms with his father for\r\nsuppressing the Cornish rebellion; and, under Henry VIII., “being one\r\nof the knights of the king’s body, was, jointly with Sir Henry Wyat,\r\nKnt., constituted governor of the Castle of Norwich. In the following\r\nyear he was one of the ambassadors to the Emperor Maximilian, touching\r\na war with France, and soon after was sole governor of Norwich Castle.”\r\n\r\nIn the eleventh year of this sovereign’s reign “he arranged the famous\r\ninterview of King Henry VIII. and Francis I. between Guisnes and\r\nArdres, and in the thirteenth year was accredited ambassador to the\r\nlatter. The next year, being treasurer of the King’s household, he\r\nwas sent ambassador to Spain, to advise with King Charles upon some\r\nproceedings in order to the war with France.” In 1525, with a view to\r\nfurther the suit of the monarch to his daughter Anne, Sir Thomas Bullen\r\nwas created Baron and Viscount Rochfort, and afterwards successively\r\nEarl of Wiltshire and Earl of Ormond, a Knight of the Garter, and Lord\r\nPrivy Seal. “He subscribed the articles against Cardinal Wolsey in 21\r\nHenry VIII., and soon after was sent again ambassador to the Emperor\r\nCharles V.”\r\n\r\nThis Sir Thomas Bullen, afterwards, as we have shown, created Baron\r\nRochfort, Viscount Rochfort, Earl of Ormond, and Earl of Wiltshire,\r\nmarried Elizabeth daughter of Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk, and by\r\nher had issue one son—George, commonly called Viscount Rochfort, but\r\nsummoned as Baron Rochfort during the lifetime of his father—and two\r\ndaughters, Anne and Mary. Lord Rochfort married Jane, daughter of\r\nHenry Parker, Earl of Morley. He was beheaded during the lifetime of\r\nhis father, and left no issue. Of the daughters, the Lady Anne Bullen,\r\nwho was created Marchioness of Pembroke, became second queen to King\r\nHenry VIII.; and the Lady Mary Bullen, married, first, William Cary,\r\nEsquire of the Body to King Henry VIII., and brother of Sir John Cary\r\nof Plashley, one of the gentlemen of the bed-chamber to the same\r\nmonarch; and, secondly, Sir William Stafford, Knt. The husband of this\r\nlady, William Cary, was the son of Thomas Cary, of Chilton Foliat, in\r\nWiltshire (son of Sir William Cary, of Cockington, Devon, Knt.—who\r\nwas slain at the battle of Tewkesbury—by his second wife, Alice,\r\ndaughter of Sir Baldwin Fulford), by his wife, Margaret, daughter and\r\nco-heiress of Sir Robert Spencer, of Spencer Combe, by the Lady Eleanor\r\nBeaufort, daughter of Edmund, and sister and co-heiress of Henry, Duke\r\nof Somerset. Lady Mary Bullen had, by her first husband, William Cary,\r\na daughter, Catherine, married to Sir Francis Knollys, K.G.; and a son,\r\nSir Henry Cary, Knt., who was created Baron Hunsdon at the coronation\r\nof Queen Elizabeth, and from whom descended the Barons Hunsdon and\r\nEarls of Dover and Monmouth; while from his brother, Sir John Cary, of\r\nPlashley, Knt., by his wife, Joyce, sister of Sir Anthony Denny, king’s\r\nremembrancer, are descended the Viscounts Falkland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Entrance Gateway, with Portcullis._]\r\n\r\nAnne Boleyn, or Bullen, was born at Hever in or about the year 1507;\r\nand in 1514, when only seven years of age, was appointed one of the\r\nmaids of honour to the King’s sister—who had then just been married to\r\nLouis XII. of France—and was allowed to remain with her when her other\r\nEnglish attendants were unceremoniously sent out of the country. On\r\nthe Queen’s second marriage with Brandon, Anne Boleyn was left under\r\nthe powerful protection of the new queen, Claude, wife of Francis I.\r\nShe was thus brought up at the French Court. When war was declared\r\nagainst France in 1522, at which time her father, Sir Thomas Boleyn,\r\nwas ambassador to that country, it is thought she was brought back\r\nto England by him, and, shortly afterwards, was appointed one of the\r\nmaids of honour to Queen Catherine, wife of Henry VIII., and was thus\r\nbrought under the notice of that detestable and profligate monarch.\r\nShe had not been long at Court when, it is said by Cavendish, a strong\r\nand mutual attachment sprang up between her and the young Lord Percy,\r\nson and heir of the Earl of Northumberland, who made her an offer of\r\nmarriage, and was accepted. At this time she was only sixteen years of\r\nage. The match, however, was not destined to be made, for the King “had\r\nalready turned his admiring eyes in the same direction, and, jealous of\r\nthe rivalry of a subject, he caused the lovers to be parted through the\r\nagency of Cardinal Wolsey, in whose household Percy had been educated;\r\nand that young nobleman, probably under compulsion, married, in 1523, a\r\ndaughter of the Earl of Shrewsbury.” Anne, on being thus compulsorily\r\nseparated from her young and fond lover, was removed to Hever. Here,\r\nwithin a few weeks, she heard of the marriage of her accepted lover,\r\nand, with feelings which can well be imagined, kept herself secluded.\r\n\r\nTo Hever the King repaired on a visit, but probably suspecting the\r\ncause of his arrival, Anne, under the pretext of sickness, kept closely\r\nto her chamber, which she did not leave until after his departure.\r\n“But this reserve was more likely to animate than daunt a royal lover;\r\nand Henry, for the purpose of restoring the reluctant lady to court,\r\nand bringing her within the sphere of his solicitations,” created her\r\nfather Baron and Viscount Rochfort, and gave him the important post\r\nof Treasurer of the Royal Household. He also surrounded himself with\r\nher relatives and friends. Among those who were his chief companions\r\nwere her father, Thomas, Viscount Rochfort; her brother George; her\r\nuncle, the Duke of Norfolk; her cousin, Sir Francis Bryan; her near\r\nrelative and admirer, Sir Henry Norris; her intimate friend, Sir\r\nWilliam Compton; and the King’s old favourite, the Duke of Suffolk—a\r\nlively but dissolute society, not one of whom showed any high regard\r\nfor marriage vows, or treated their infringement as anything but a\r\njest. “Suffolk,” says Mr. Brewer, “had been betrothed to one lady;\r\nthen married another; then abandoned her, on the plea of his previous\r\ncontract, for the lady whom he had in the first instance rejected.\r\nNorfolk lived with his duchess on the most scandalous terms. Sir\r\nWilliam Compton had been cited in the Ecclesiastical Court for living\r\nin open adultery with a married woman. The fate of Norris and George\r\nBoleyn is too well known to require comment. Sir Francis Bryan, the\r\nchief companion in the King’s amusements, and the minister of his\r\npleasures, was pointed out by common fame as more dissolute than all\r\nthe rest.” Sir Thomas Wyatt, though married, wore her miniature round\r\nhis neck, and sang of her love. Still, however, Henry’s suit, which was\r\ndishonourable even to one so depraved and lost to honour as he was,\r\nwas unprosperous when made; and she is said by an old writer, and one\r\nnot favourable to her, to have replied firmly to the King, “Your wife\r\nI cannot be, both in respect of my own unworthiness, and also because\r\nyou have a queen already; and your mistress I will not be.” Foiled in\r\nhis attempt to gain her by any other means, the unscrupulous monarch\r\nnow began seriously to set himself to the task of obtaining a divorce\r\nfrom Queen Catherine, who had been his wife for seventeen years, in\r\norder that he might replace her by Anne Boleyn. The history of these\r\nproceedings is a part of the history of the kingdom, and need not be\r\nhere detailed. It is, however, a tradition of Hever that when the\r\nKing came “a wooing” he sounded his bugle in the distance, that his\r\nlady-love might know of his approach. The divorce being obtained, Anne\r\nBoleyn, having previously been married to the King, became “indeed a\r\nqueen;” and having given birth to two children—Queen Elizabeth and a\r\nstill-born son—was arrested on a false and disgraceful charge, and was\r\nbeheaded, to make room for a new queen in the person of one of her own\r\nmaids of honour, Jane Seymour.\r\n\r\nOf the personal appearance of Queen Anne Boleyn Mr. Brewer thus\r\npleasantly discourses:—“The blood of the Ormonds ran in her veins.\r\nFrom her Irish descent she inherited—\r\n\r\n  ‘The black-blue Irish hair and Irish eyes.’\r\n\r\nAnd, like the Irish Isolt of the great poet, Anne Boleyn was remarkable\r\nfor the exquisite turn of her neck and her glossy throat. She was a\r\nlittle, lively, sparkling brunette, with fascinating eyes and long\r\nblack hair, which, contrary to the sombre fashion of those days,\r\nshe wore coquettishly floating loosely down her back, interlaced\r\nwith jewels. The beauty of her eyes and hair struck all beholders\r\nalike—grave ecclesiastics and spruce young sprigs of nobility.\r\n‘Sitting _in_ her hair on a litter’ is the feature at her coronation\r\nwhich seems to have made the deepest impression upon Archbishop\r\nCranmer. ‘On Sunday morning (1st September, 1532), solemnly and in\r\npublic, Madame Anne being then at Windsor, _con li capilli sparsi_,\r\ncompletely covered with the most costly jewels, was created by the king\r\nCountess of Pembroke.’ George Wyatt, grandson of Sir Thomas Wyatt, the\r\npoet, one of her admirers, describes her, in the fantastic language of\r\nthe sixteenth century, as having ‘a beauty not so whitely as clear and\r\nfresh above all that we may esteem, which appeared much more excellent\r\nby her favour passing sweet and cheerful. There was found, indeed, upon\r\nthe side of her nail upon one of her fingers some little show of a\r\nnail, which yet was so small, by the report of some that have seen her,\r\nas the work-master seemed to leave it an occasion of greater grace to\r\nher hand, which, with the tip of one of her fingers, might be and was\r\nusually by her hidden, without any least blemish to it.’”\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Wiltshire (Sir Thomas Boleyn), father of the ill-fated\r\nqueen, died in 1538—two years after witnessing the beheading of his\r\nonly son, Viscount Rochfort, and of his daughter, Queen Anne Boleyn;\r\nand on his death the family of Boleyn, in the main line, became extinct.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of the Earl, Henry, with the rapacity that kept pace\r\nwith his profligacy, claimed and seized the castle of Hever in right\r\nof his murdered wife, and subsequently settled it upon one of his\r\nlater wives. He also purchased adjoining lands from others of the\r\nBoleyn family, and thus enlarged the estate. The castle and manor of\r\nHever, and other adjoining lands, were settled upon Anne of Cleves,\r\nafter her divorce, for life, or so long as she should remain in the\r\nkingdom, at the yearly rent of £93 13_s._ 3½_d._ She made Hever her\r\ngeneral place of residence, and died there according to some writers,\r\nbut at Chelsea according to others, in 1557. In “the same year the\r\nHever estates were sold by commissioners, authorised by the Crown,\r\nto Sir Edward Waldegrave, lord chamberlain to the household of Queen\r\nMary, who, on the accession of Elizabeth, was divested of all his\r\nemployments, and committed to the Tower, where he died in 1561.” The\r\nestates afterwards passed through the family of Humphreys to that of\r\nMedley.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Hever Castle, from the East._]\r\n\r\nIn 1745 Hever Castle was purchased by Timothy Waldo, of London, and\r\nof Clapham, in Surrey. The family of Waldo is said to derive itself,\r\naccording to Hasted, from Thomas Waldo, of Lyons, in the kingdom of\r\nFrance, and was among the first who publicly renounced the doctrines of\r\nthe Church of Rome, “one of the descendants of whom, in the reign of\r\nElizabeth, in order to escape the persecutions of the Duke d’Alva, came\r\nover, it is said, and settled in England.” In 1575 Peter Waldo resided\r\nat Mitcham. His eldest son, Lawrence—according to Mr. Morris Jones,\r\nwho has made much laudable research into the history of the family—had\r\nissue, by his wife Elizabeth, no fewer than fifteen children. Of these\r\nthe twelfth child, Daniel Waldo, is the one pertaining to our present\r\ninquiry. He was a citizen and clothworker of London, and was fined\r\nas alderman and sheriff in 1661. He married Anne Claxton, by whom he\r\nhad issue nine children. Of these the eldest son, Daniel Waldo, some\r\nof whose property was burnt down in the great fire of London in 1666,\r\nmarried twice, and from him are descended the Waldos of Harrow. Edward,\r\nthe second son, became the purchaser, after the fire, of the sites\r\nof the “Black Bull,” the “Cardinal’s Hat,” and the “Black Boy,” in\r\nCheapside, on which he erected a “great messuage,” where he dwelt; and\r\nin which, when it was taken down in 1861, was some fine oak carving,\r\nnow at Gungrog.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Hever Castle, from the West._]\r\n\r\nThis Edward Waldo was knighted—“at his own house in Cheapside,” the\r\nvery house he had built—by the King, who was his guest, in 1677.\r\nOn this occasion “he had the honour of entertaining his sovereign,\r\ntogether with the Princesses Mary and Anne and the Duchess of York,\r\nwho, from a canopy of state in front of his house, viewed the civic\r\nprocession pass along Cheapside on its way to Guildhall.” Sir Edward\r\nmarried three times. He died at his residence at Pinner in 1705, aged\r\nseventy-five, and was buried at Harrow. Nathaniel and Isaac, third\r\nand fourth sons of Daniel Waldo, died unmarried. Timothy, the fifth\r\nson, we shall speak of presently. Samuel, the sixth son, citizen and\r\nmercer of London, and freeman of the Clothworkers’ Company, married,\r\nfirst, a daughter of Sir Thomas Allen, of Finchley; and, secondly,\r\nSusan Churchman; and had, among other issue, Daniel Waldo, one of whose\r\ndaughters, Sarah (married to Israel Woolliston), died at the age of\r\nninety-eight, leaving her cousin, Col. Sibthorpe, M.P., her executor;\r\nIsaac Waldo, one of whose daughters, Sarah, married Humphrey Sibthorpe,\r\nM.D., Sheridan Professor of Botany, whose son, Humphrey Sibthorpe, M.P.\r\n(father of Col. Sibthorpe, M.P.), assumed for himself and his heirs,\r\nby royal sign-manual, the additional name and the arms of Waldo on\r\ninheriting the property left him by his relative, Peter Waldo, Esq., of\r\nMitcham and of Warton.\r\n\r\nSir Timothy Waldo, to whom allusion has been made, the purchaser of\r\nHever Castle, was admitted attorney of the King’s Bench and solicitor\r\nin Chancery in 1730; in 1739 he was under-sheriff of the city of\r\nLondon, and he was a liveryman and the clerk of the Salters’ Company.\r\nIn 1736 he married Catherine Wakefield, and had by her an only child,\r\nJane, who married, in 1762, George Medley, Esq., M.P., of Buxted. Sir\r\nTimothy, who was knighted in 1769, died at Clapham in 1786, his wife\r\nsurviving him, and dying in 1806, aged ninety-five.\r\n\r\nTheir sole daughter and heiress, Jane, wife of George Medley, inherited\r\nall the property, including Hever Castle. She had no issue, and died\r\nin 1829, in her ninety-second year, leaving her large possessions,\r\nthe personalty of which was sworn under £180,000, to her cousin,\r\nJane Waldo, only daughter and heiress of Edward Waldo, of London,\r\nwho administered to the estate as cousin and only next of kin. This\r\nlady, who thus became the possessor of Hever Castle, died at Tunbridge\r\nWells in 1840, when the family became extinct. The name of Waldo had,\r\nhowever, been taken by royal sign-manual, in 1830, by Edmund Wakefield\r\nMeade, Esq., of Newbridge House, Dawlish, son of Francis Meade, of\r\nLambeth. Edmund Meade-Waldo, Esq., became resident at Stonewall Park,\r\nnear Hever Castle, which memorable edifice is still in possession of\r\nthis family. He married Harriet, second daughter of Colonel Rochfort,\r\nM.P., by whom he left issue two sons and one daughter; the eldest son\r\nand heir being Edmund Waldo Meade-Waldo, Esq. The daughter, Harriet\r\nDorothea, was married, in 1850, to the Rev. W. W. Battye, Rector of\r\nHever, to which living he was presented by his father-in-law.\r\n\r\nThere are few ancient houses in the kingdom more deeply interesting\r\nto the curious occasional visitor than Hever; it does not, however,\r\nconvey ideas of grandeur or magnificence. It never could have been\r\nlarge. Certainly at no period did it supply ample room to accommodate\r\nthe suite of a luxurious monarch; and there is little doubt that the\r\nvisits of the eighth Henry were made, if not secretly, without state,\r\nwhen he went to woo the unhappy lady he afterwards—and not long\r\nafterwards—murdered.\r\n\r\nIn the small chamber of the ground-floor, which still retains its\r\nminstrel’s gallery and its panelling of oak, was the bad king\r\nentertained by his victims; and in a very tiny chamber slept in pure\r\ninnocence the object of his lust—a most reluctant bride and most\r\nmiserable wife.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Anne Boleyn’s Chamber._]\r\n\r\nYet Hever Castle was a stronghold, and a place well calculated for\r\nsafety in the troublous times in which it was built and embattled. It\r\nis surrounded by a moat, across which a bridge leads to the entrance\r\ngateway. The entrance is defended by a strong portcullis, composed of\r\nseveral large pieces of wood laid across each other like a harrow,\r\nand riveted throughout with iron, designed to be let down in case\r\nof surprise, and when there was not time to shut the gate. To this\r\nsucceeds an iron portcullis. It is followed by an inner solid oaken\r\ndoor, riveted with iron, firmly bound with iron pieces going the whole\r\nlength across, and studded with iron knobs. A wooden portcullis then\r\nfollows. Immediately adjoining these are two guardrooms, in which a\r\ndozen men-at-arms might long dispute the passage of an enemy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Hever Castle: the Court-yard._]\r\n\r\nOver the external gate, directly under the battlements, a series of\r\nmachicolations project boldly forward: from these molten lead and\r\nother deadly appliances and missiles could be poured and discharged on\r\nthe heads of assailants with terrible effect. Passing through these\r\ngates and beneath the portcullises, the visitor enters a spacious\r\ncourt-yard, surrounded on all its sides by the building. From this\r\ncourt-yard or quadrangle he enters the old Dining-hall, where the racks\r\nfor hunting-spears are still visible, and where grotesque decorations\r\nwill not fail to be noticed. In the stained-glass windows are the\r\narms of the Boleyns and the Howards. Near this is the Chapel, and\r\ncontinuing along the passages are two rooms bearing the names of Anne\r\nBoleyn’s Bed-room and Anne of Cleves’ Room. Anne Boleyn’s Room “is\r\nreally an interesting apartment, beautifully panelled, and contains\r\nthe original family chairs, tables, muniment box, and what is called\r\nAnne’s bed.”[46] To this apartment several ante-rooms succeed, and the\r\nsuite terminates in a grand Gallery occupying the whole length of the\r\nbuilding, in which the judicial meetings and the social gatherings of\r\nthe ancient family were held. It is about 150 feet in length, by 20\r\nfeet in width, with a vaulted roof, and panelled throughout with carved\r\noak. On one side, placed at equal distances apart, are three recesses:\r\nthe first, having a flight of three steps, is fitted up with elbowed\r\nbenches, where the lord of the castle in old times held his courts,\r\nand where Henry VIII. is said, on the occasions of his visits, to have\r\nreceived the congratulations of the gentry; a second was occupied by\r\nthe fire; and the third was used as a quiet corner for the old folks,\r\nwhile the younger ones frolicked throughout the mazes of the dance. At\r\none end of the Gallery a trap-door leads to a dark chamber, called the\r\nDungeon, in which the family are believed to have sheltered themselves\r\nin time of trouble, although it is manifest that the height of the\r\nroom, compared with that of the building, must have betrayed its\r\nexistence to even a careless observer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _In the Long Gallery._]\r\n\r\nThe interior of that part properly called “the castle”—_e.g._ the\r\nentrance—is approached by a winding staircase in one of the towers.\r\n“About midway the staircase opens into the narrow vestibule of the\r\ngreat state-room. The Gothic tracery over the fire-place is extremely\r\nbeautiful both in design and in execution. It consists of two angels,\r\neach bearing two shields, showing the arms and alliances of the Cary\r\nand Boleyn families, of Cary and Waldo, Boleyn and Howard, and Henry\r\nVIII. and Boleyn.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWESTWOOD PARK.\r\n\r\n\r\nWESTWOOD—one of the very finest, most perfect, and most interesting\r\nof the Elizabethan mansions that yet remain in England—lies about\r\ntwo miles from Droitwich, in Worcestershire, and six or seven from\r\nthe “faithful city.” It stands in its own grand old deer park of some\r\nhundreds of acres in extent, and studded with such an assemblage of\r\nnoble forest trees as is seldom seen. The oaks with which the park\r\nabounds are almost matchless for their beautiful forms and for their\r\nclean growth (for they are clear from moss or other extraneous growth\r\nfrom bole to crest), as well as, in some instances, for their gigantic\r\nstature. One of these “brave old oaks” in front of the mansion we had\r\nthe curiosity to measure, and found it to be no less than eighteen\r\nyards in circumference of bole on the ground, and thirty-one feet in\r\ncircumference at three feet from the earth, with a stem hollowed by\r\ntime. It is one of the lions of the place, and looks venerable and\r\ntime-worn enough to have braved the tempests of a thousand years.\r\nAnother oak, not far from this, is one of the finest in England, having\r\na clear trunk, without bend or branch, “straight as a mast,” to some\r\nforty feet or more in height before a single branch appears.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Entrance Lodge._]\r\n\r\nThere are two Entrance Lodges to the park from the road leading from\r\nDroitwich to Ombersley; the principal of these we engrave. Entering the\r\ngates at this Lodge, the drive leads up the park to the mansion, which\r\nforms a conspicuous and striking object in front, the house and its\r\nsurroundings being effectively situated on rising ground. Immediately\r\nin front of the mansion is the Gatehouse, one of the most quaintly\r\npicturesque in the kingdom. It consists of twin lodges of red brick,\r\nwith ornamental gables and hip-knobs, with a central open-spired turret\r\ncovering the entrance gates. The gates, which are of iron, and bear\r\nthe monogram J P (for John Pakington), are surmounted by an open-work\r\nparapet, or frieze, of stone, in which stand clear the three garbs and\r\nthe three mullets of the Pakington arms. Over this rises the open tower\r\nbefore spoken of. Passing through these gates, the drive sweeps up\r\nbetween the smooth grass lawns to the slightly advanced front portico\r\nwhich gives access to the mansion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Westwood, from the Main Approach._]\r\n\r\nBefore we enter let us say a few words on the general design and\r\nappearance of this unique and remarkable building. The general\r\nblock-plan of the house may be described as a combination of the square\r\nand saltire, the arms of the saltire projecting considerably from the\r\nangles of the square, and forming what may almost be called wings,\r\nradiating from its centre—the whole of the surface of this general\r\nblock-plan being cut up with numberless projecting mullioned windows.\r\nThe four projecting wings, which, like the rest of the building, are\r\nthree stories in height, are each surmounted with a spire. Around the\r\nwhole building runs a boldly carved stone parapet, bearing the garbs\r\nand mullets of the Pakington arms, alternating the one with the other,\r\nand producing a striking and pleasing effect, while the mullets also\r\nappear on the ornamental gables, and on the vanes and hip-knobs. The\r\nadvanced porch, erected at a later period, is of stone, and is in the\r\n_Renaissance_ style; over its central arch is Jove on the eagle; and\r\nin front of the main building, over the porch, are the Pakington arms\r\nboldly carved.\r\n\r\nStanding clear from the mansion, and at some distance in front of the\r\nnorth-east and south-east wings, are two so-called “turrets.” These\r\nare small residences, if they may so be termed, each three stories\r\nin height, and each having two entrance doors. They are surmounted\r\nwith picturesquely formed spire roofs, covered with scale slating.\r\nOriginally there were four of these square towers—the two now\r\nremaining, and two other corresponding ones at the opposite angles.\r\nThey were all four in existence in 1775, but two have since been\r\nremoved. At that time they were connected with the wings by walls,\r\nand then again were connected with the Gatehouse and other walls in\r\na peculiar and geometrically formed device. A highly interesting and\r\ncurious bird’s-eye view of Westwood, drawn by Dorothy Anne Pakington\r\nin the year above named, is preserved in the Hall, and shows the\r\narrangement of the ornamental flower-beds, terraces, fruit walls, &c.,\r\nwith great accuracy.\r\n\r\nFrom the Gatehouse, on either side, an excellent fence of pillar\r\nand rail encloses in a ring fence the mansion and its surrounding\r\nornamental grounds, and kitchen and other gardens. These\r\npleasure-grounds, several acres in extent, are admirably laid out,\r\nand planted with evergreens of remarkably fine growth. The hedges,\r\nor rather massive walls, of laurel, box, Portugal laurel, and other\r\nshrubs; the grand assemblage of conifers, which here seem to find a\r\ngenial home, and to grow with unequalled luxuriance; and the cedars of\r\nLebanon, yews, and numberless other evergreens, form these grounds into\r\none of the most lovely winter gardens we have ever visited. Among the\r\nmain features of these ornamental grounds are the “Ladies’ Garden,” a\r\nretired spot enclosed in walls of evergreens seven or eight feet in\r\nheight, having on one side an elegant summer-house, which commands\r\na beautiful view of the Malvern Hills and of the rich intervening\r\ncountry, and in the centre a sundial surrounded by a rosary and beds\r\nof rich flowers; and the Lavender Walk, where, between a long avenue\r\nof tall lavender-bushes, planted by the present Lady Hampton, the\r\nelegant and accomplished successors of the “stately dames of yore”\r\ncan stroll about and enjoy the delicious scent. Another great feature\r\nis the splendid growth of some of the trees—notably a Wellingtonia,\r\nnine feet in girth at the ground, and fully thirty feet in height,\r\nand a magnificent specimen of _Picea pinsapo_, measuring ninety feet\r\nin circumference of its branches, and said truly to be the finest and\r\nmost perfectly-grown tree of the kind in the kingdom. The kitchen\r\ngardens are of considerable extent, and well arranged, but there is no\r\nconservatory. Altogether the ornamental grounds are of great beauty,\r\nand harmonize well with the character of the building.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Gatehouse, as seen from the Mansion._]\r\n\r\nOne of the great glories of Westwood is its water. It has three lakes,\r\nthe largest of which, no less than seventy acres in extent, forms\r\na grand feature in the landscape, and, with its many swans and the\r\nnumbers of wild fowl that congregate upon and around it, adds much to\r\nthe beauty of the park scenery. On one side the lake is backed up by a\r\nwood through which, on the banks, a delightful grassy walk leads to the\r\nBoat-house, from whose upper rooms delightful views of land and water\r\nare obtained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Entrance Porch._]\r\n\r\nThe principal apartments in this noble mansion are the Great Hall,\r\nor Front Hall, as it is usually called; the Library, the Dining and\r\nDrawing Rooms, the Saloon, the Grand Staircase, and the Chapel; but,\r\nbesides these, there are a number of other rooms, and all the usual\r\nfamily and domestic apartments and offices. To the interior, however,\r\nwe can but devote a very brief space.\r\n\r\nThe Entrance Porch (shown in the preceding engraving), on the north\r\nfront, opens into the Front Hall. This occupies the entire length of\r\nthe main body of the building from east to west, and is about sixty\r\nfeet in length. The entrance door is in the centre, and on either side\r\nare deeply recessed mullioned and transomed windows, and there is a\r\nsimilar window at each end. From one of the recesses a doorway and\r\nsteps lead up to the Dining-room; while from the other, in a similar\r\nmanner, access is gained to the Library. On the opposite side a doorway\r\nleads to the Grand Staircase. This hall, one part of which is also used\r\nas a billiard-room, contains some magnificent old carved furniture and\r\ncabinets, and the walls are hung with family portraits. In the windows\r\nare a series of stained-glass armorial bearings and inscriptions,\r\nrepresenting the arms of Pakington and the family alliances. These\r\nare:—\r\n\r\n  1413. Robert Pakington and Elizabeth Acton.\r\n\r\n  1436. John Pakington and Margaret Ballard.\r\n\r\n  1490. John Pakington and Elizabeth Washbourne.\r\n\r\n  1537. Robert Pakington and Anne Baldwynne.\r\n\r\n  1559. Sir John Pakington and Anne Darcy.\r\n\r\n  1575. Sir Thomas Pakington and Dorothy Kytson.\r\n\r\n  1620. Sir John Pakington and Frances Ferrars.\r\n\r\n  1625. Sir John Pakington and —— Smith.\r\n\r\n  1633. Sir John Pakington and Margaret Keys.\r\n\r\n  1679. Sir John Pakington and Dorothy Coventry.\r\n\r\n  1727. Sir John Pakington and Hester Preest.\r\n\r\n  1727. Sir John Pakington and Frances Parker.\r\n\r\n  1743. Sir Herbert Perrot Pakington and Elizabeth Conyers.\r\n\r\n  1762. Sir John Pakington and Mary Bray.\r\n\r\n  1795. Sir Herbert Perrot Pakington and Elizabeth Hawkins.\r\n\r\n  “1822. John Somerset Pakington, Esq., born 1799, wedyd 1stly, Mary,\r\n  dau. of Moreton Aglionby Slaney, of Shiffnall, Esq.”\r\n\r\n  1830. Sir John Pakington died unmarried.\r\n\r\n  “1844. John Somerset Pakington, Esq., created Bart. 1846, wedyd\r\n  2ndly, Augusta, dau. of Geo. Murray, Bp. of Rochester.”\r\n\r\nAmong the portraits in this fine old room are the present Lord Hampton;\r\nthe Earl of Strafford; Hester Perrott, daughter and sole heiress of\r\nSir Herbert Perrott, of Haroldstone, and second wife of Sir John\r\nPakington, Bart.; Sir John Perrott, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, 1583;\r\nMargaret Pakington (afterwards Mrs. Dowdeswell), daughter of Sir John\r\nPakington of Hampton Lovett, the celebrated Recorder of Worcester; Sir\r\nJohn Pakington, M.P. for Worcester from 1690 to 1727; Ursula, Lady\r\nScudamore, daughter of Sir John Pakington; and many others.\r\n\r\nThe Dining-room, which occupies the lower story of the north-east\r\nradiating wing, has an effective geometrical ceiling, and its walls\r\nare hung with family portraits. The Library similarly occupies\r\nthe lower story of the corresponding or south-east wing. It is a\r\nnoble room, lined with a large and valuable assemblage of books,\r\nand fitted and furnished in an appropriate manner. The ceiling,\r\nwhose geometric panelling and other decorations are in high relief,\r\nbears among its other devices the mullet of the family arms. In the\r\nLibrary are, among many other Art treasures, two important historical\r\npictures—contemporary portraits of Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, and Mary,\r\nhis wife, daughter of Henry VII., King of England, and widow of Louis\r\nXII. of France—on panel.\r\n\r\nThe view from these rooms is truly magnificent. Immediately in front\r\nis the enclosed space already spoken of, with its grass lawns, its\r\nbroad carriage drives, its luxuriant shrubberies; the ivy-grown and\r\npicturesque towers, one on either side; the grand old Gatehouse,\r\nwith its central open-work tower, and picturesque boundary railings\r\ncutting it off from the park. Beyond this is seen the park, with its\r\nherds of deer, its forest trees of centuries of growth dotted about\r\nthe landscape; its noble sheet of water, on which swans and wild fowl\r\nabound; and beyond, again, the thickly wooded confines of the grounds\r\nand the distant heights. Thus a view of imposing loveliness and of\r\nvast extent is gained from the windows of this side of the mansion.\r\nBut, indeed, one of the main characteristics of Westwood is that, from\r\nwhatever point the mansion is seen, it forms a striking and a pleasing\r\nobject; and that, from whatever window one looks, a scene of surpassing\r\nbeauty is presented to the eye.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Grand Staircase._]\r\n\r\nThe Grand Staircase, of which we give an engraving, is a marked feature\r\nof the interior of the house, and differs in general character from\r\nany other with which we are acquainted. It is of four landings, and\r\nat each angle, as well as in the intermediate spaces, standing clear\r\nto a considerable height above the banisters, rises a Corinthian\r\npillar with richly carved capital, supporting a ball. The whole is of\r\ndark oak, and has a rich and singular appearance. The series of these\r\npillars and balls numbers thirteen. The Staircase has a panelled oak\r\nceiling, which forms the floor of the upper gallery, from which the\r\nbed-rooms are gained. The walls of the Staircase are hung with fine old\r\nportraits, and others of more modern date: among them are the “Du^{sse}\r\nDou^e de la Tremouille, née Princesse d’Orange,” 1626; General Monk;\r\nMaster Herbert and Miss Cecilia Pakington; and the late Bishop Murray,\r\nof Rochester, full length, by Falconer. At the foot of the Staircase\r\nis the Baron Marochetti’s admirable bust of Lord Hampton, before that\r\nwell-deserved title was conferred upon him. It bears the following\r\ninscription:—“Presented to Lady Pakington by the Medical Officers of\r\nthe Royal Navy, in grateful acknowledgment of the benefits conferred\r\nupon that department of H.M. service during the administration of the\r\nRight Hon. Sir John S. Pakington, Bart., G.C.B., &c., 1858-9.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Saloon._]\r\n\r\nFrom the landing at the head of the Grand Staircase access is gained,\r\non the one hand, to the Saloon and the apartments connected with it;\r\nand, on the other, to Lady Hampton’s private rooms, the sleeping\r\napartments on the same floor, and to the staircase to the upper story.\r\n\r\nThe Private Chapel, approached from the foot of the Staircase, occupies\r\nthe wing at the opposite angle from the Library. Its ceiling is of\r\noak, and it is fitted with open seats, also of oak, with fleur-de-lis\r\npoppy-heads. The stained-glass window, representing the Adoration and\r\nthe Ascension, is remarkably good in design and pure in colouring. On\r\na bracket on the wall is a splendid piece of sculpture, representing\r\nMary Magdalene supporting the dead Christ.\r\n\r\nThe Saloon—the principal internal feature of Westwood—occupies the\r\nentire space, in the central block of building, over the Front Hall.\r\nIt is a noble and lofty apartment, lit by two deeply recessed large\r\nmullioned and transomed windows to the front, and one, of equally\r\nlarge size, at each end. The ceiling, although of a somewhat later\r\nperiod, is a marvellously fine example of modelled plaster-work, the\r\nwreaths and festoons of flowers standing out clear from the surface,\r\nand modelled true to Nature. It is divided into ornamental panels,\r\nenclosing wreaths and festoons, and round the room is a boldly moulded\r\nand richly decorated oak frieze. In the centre of the side opposite\r\nthe windows is a massive and elaborately designed oak chimney-piece,\r\nreaching up to the ceiling. The pillars, and mouldings, and panels,\r\nand, indeed, every part of this fine example of ancient Art, are\r\nelaborately carved with arabesques and foliage; the mouldings and\r\ncornices being likewise richly carved with grotesque figures and other\r\ncharacteristic ornaments. In the centre panel, over the fire-place, is\r\na fine contemporary half-length portrait of King Henry VIII.\r\n\r\nThe walls are hung with grand old tapestry, and this, at three of the\r\ncorners, conceals the doors leading respectively to the Drawing-room,\r\nthe Staircase, and another apartment. The subjects of the tapestry,\r\ncommencing at the doorway from the Staircase, are—First, “Isaac,\r\nblind; Rebecca sends Jacob for two kids.” Second, “Laban overtakes\r\nJacob at Mount Gilead; kisses his daughter.” Third, “Jacob kisses\r\nRachel at the well, and removes the stone from its mouth.” Fourth,\r\n“Jacob brings home the kids.” Fifth, “Jacob meets his brother Esau, and\r\nbows at his feet.” Sixth, “Jacob divides his flocks.”\r\n\r\nThe Drawing-room opens from the Saloon, and is over the Library: it\r\nis an elegant room, with a ceiling of moulded pargetting in scrolls\r\nand foliage, and is of great elegance in all its appointments. At the\r\nopposite end of the Saloon a doorway opens into an apartment over the\r\nDining-room. It is now disused, but, with its panelled frescoed walls\r\nand beautifully decorated ceiling, is an apartment of much interest.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the rooms of this grand old mansion do not require\r\nspecial notice; it is enough to say they are all full of interest, and\r\nthat they contain many pictures of value.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOF the many families of note upon which we have treated in these pages,\r\nfew are of greater antiquity or possessed of more historic interest\r\nthan that of Pakington, of which the Right Hon. Lord Hampton is the\r\nhead. It dates from Norman times, and presents a long succession of\r\nnotables, whose history is that of the various ages in which they\r\nlived, and moved, and had their being. It is clear, from the foundation\r\nof Kenilworth Monastery, that the family flourished in the reign of\r\nHenry I., and from that time down to the present moment its members\r\nhave been among the most celebrated men of the country. In the reign\r\nof Henry IV. Robert Pakington died, and was succeeded by his son John,\r\nwho in turn was succeeded by his son of the same name, who married\r\nElizabeth, daughter and heiress of Thomas Washbourne, of Stanford, and\r\nthus the family became connected with the county of Worcester. By this\r\nlady he had issue three sons—John, Robert, and Humphrey. The eldest\r\nof these, John Pakington, was of the Inner Temple, and was constituted\r\nChirographer of the Common Pleas in the reign of Henry VII., and in the\r\nnext reign was made Lent Reader and Treasurer of the Inner Temple; and\r\nin the same year (20 Henry VIII.) had a grant from the King “that he,\r\nthe said John Pakington, for the time to come shall have full liberty\r\nduring his life to wear his hat in his presence, and his successors, or\r\nany other person whatsoever; and not to be uncovered on any occasion or\r\ncause whatsoever, against his will and good liking; also that he shall\r\nnot be appointed, called, or compelled to take the order of knighthood,\r\nor degree, state, or order of a baron of the Exchequer, serjent-at-law,\r\nor any office or encumbrance thereto relating.”\r\n\r\nIn 1532, however, he was appointed serjeant-at-law, and received a\r\ndischarge so as to enable him to accept that office. Having been\r\nappointed a justice of North Wales, he was, in 1535, commissioned to\r\nconclude and compound all forfeitures, offences, fines, and sums of\r\nmoney due to the King or to his late father, Henry VII. He received\r\nmany other appointsovereign ments and honours, and was ultimately\r\nknighted. He received from the a grant of all the manors belonging\r\nto the dissolved monastery of Westwood, and thus that fine property\r\ncame to the Pakingtons. At the time of his death, in 1560, Sir John\r\nwas seized of thirty-one manors, and of much other land which he had\r\npurchased from seventy different persons. Leland says that he resided\r\n“at a goodly new house of brick, called Hampton Court, six miles from\r\nWorcester.” Sir John is variously stated to have married Anne Rolle\r\n(widow of Tychebourne) and Anne Dacres. Whichever of these is correct,\r\nhe died without male issue, leaving his estates divided amongst his\r\ntwo daughters—Ursula and Bridget—and his two brothers, Robert and\r\nHumphrey.\r\n\r\nHis brother, Robert Pakington, was M.P. for the City of London in the\r\ntime of Henry VIII., and was murdered in the streets of that city in\r\n1537. By his wife, Catherine, daughter of Sir John Baldwin, Lord Chief\r\nJustice of the Common Pleas (by his wife, a daughter of Dormer of\r\nWycombe, through whom the manor of Ailsbury came to the family), he had\r\nissue one son—Sir Thomas—and three daughters.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Pakington, who was knighted by Queen Mary, succeeded\r\nto the estates of the Pakingtons and Baldwins. He was sheriff of\r\nWorcestershire in the 3rd of Elizabeth, and, dying in 1571, at Bath\r\nPlace, Holborn, was conveyed in great pomp to Ailsbury, the officers\r\nof the College of Arms attending, and buried there in state. By his\r\nwife (who survived him, and married, secondly, Sir Thomas Kitson, of\r\nHargrave), Sir Thomas had, with other issue, a son—Sir John, by whom\r\nhe was succeeded—and three daughters.\r\n\r\nSir John Pakington, the “Lusty Pakington” of Queen Elizabeth’s Court,\r\nwas an especial favourite of the “Virgin Queen,” and a man of rank in\r\nhis day and generation. It is said that “Good Queen Bess” “first took\r\nnotice of Sir John in her progress to Worcester, where she invited\r\nhim to attend her Court, where he lived at his own expense in great\r\nsplendour and reputation, with an equipage not inferior to some of the\r\nhighest officers, although he had no greater honour than Knight of the\r\nBath, which was conferred upon him in the lifetime of his father. He\r\nwas remarkable for his stature and comely person, and had distinguished\r\nhimself so much by his manly exercises that he was called ‘Lusty\r\nPakington.’”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _North-east View._]\r\n\r\n“Having by his expensive life contracted great debts, he took the wise\r\nresolution of retiring into the country, and said he would feed on\r\nbread and verjuice until he had made up for his extravagances; which\r\ncoming to the royal ear, the queen gave him a grant of a gentleman’s\r\nestate in Suffolk, worth eight or nine hundred pounds a year, besides\r\ngoods and chattels, which had been escheated to the Crown; but after\r\nhe had been in the country to take possession, he could not behold\r\nthe miseries of the distressed family without remorse and compassion;\r\nand the melancholy spectacle of the unhappy mother and her children\r\nwrought so effectually upon his fine feelings, that he repaired to\r\ncourt immediately, and humbly besought the queen to excuse him from\r\nenriching himself by such means, and did not leave the presence until\r\nhe had obtained his request, which involved the restoration of the\r\nproperty to the rightful owner. Soon after this he left the court,\r\nbut not before he had liquidated all his debts, and then, with great\r\nreputation and honour, he commenced his journey into the country, being\r\nhandsomely attended by servants and tenants to the number of sixty,\r\nwell mounted and appointed, who came purposely from his estates to\r\npay him this compliment, and waited at the court gates while he was\r\ntaking leave of the queen. After settlement in the country, Elizabeth\r\ngranted him for sixty years (in the 25th of her reign), for his good\r\nand faithful services, several lordships, manors, and lands which had\r\nfallen to the Crown, in no less than seventeen counties. He was also\r\nconstituted lieutenant and _Custos Rotulorum_ of Worcestershire, and\r\nappointed bowbearer of Malvern Chase, one of the best in England, which\r\nhe retained until he had finished his noble park at Hampton Lovet;\r\nand then, that chase being at too great a distance from his dwelling,\r\nhe obtained the queen’s leave to dispose of it. He was in Elizabeth’s\r\nfavour to the end, as appears as well from other evidence as from a\r\ngrant she made him for eight years (in the 40th year of her reign, he\r\npaying into the Exchequer £40 per annum) that no one should import\r\ninto the kingdom, or make any starch, but by his permission. By his\r\naffability and obliging deportment he acquired the good opinion of his\r\nequals and inferiors, and by his courage and resolution on occasions\r\nrequiring the exercise of those attributes, he became formidable\r\nto persons in power. A memorable instance of this occurred when he\r\nexecuted the office of sheriff for his county. The Lord Chief Baron\r\nPeriam having committed a gentleman at the assizes, Sir John, sitting\r\nin his sheriff’s seat, called to him to stay, telling the judge he\r\nwould answer for his forthcoming; neither could he be dissuaded by\r\nall the menaces he received, boldly alleging in his defence that the\r\ngentleman was his prisoner, and he as sheriff was accountable for him.\r\nSir John is said on one occasion to have betted with three courtiers\r\nto swim against them from Westminster, _i.e._ Whitehall Stairs, to\r\nGreenwich for a stake of £3,000; but Queen Elizabeth, out of her\r\nspecial regard for him, and her fear for his life or health, by her\r\nimperative command prevented it.” “The good queen,” it is said, “who\r\nhad particular tenderness for ‘handsome fellows,’ would not permit Sir\r\nJohn to run the hazard of the trial.”\r\n\r\nFrom this worthy member of a worthy family the popular tune of\r\n“Pakington’s Pound,” or “Paggington’s Pound,” which has held its own\r\nfor three centuries, takes its origin. This tune, which in Queen\r\nElizabeth’s Virginal Book is named “Packington’s Pound,” is called by\r\nBen Jonson “Paggington’s Pound,” as also in an ancient MS. “A Fancy\r\nof Sir John Paginton” appears in many of the early books of tunes,\r\nand numberless ballads were written to it. Even Shakspere’s ballad\r\n(supposed to have been written by him) on Sir Thomas Lucy is written\r\nto this tune. It has been stated by some writers that, besides the tune\r\nof “Pakington’s Pound,” that of “Sir Roger de Coverley” took its origin\r\nfrom this worthy; but this is surely a mistake, as the latter tune\r\ntakes its origin from one of the Calverleys of Yorkshire.\r\n\r\nSir John Pakington married the daughter of Mr. Humphrey South, Queen\r\nElizabeth’s silkman, of Cheapside, London, the representative of\r\nan ancient family in Leicestershire. She was the widow of Alderman\r\nBarnham, “who left her very rich; and that consideration, together\r\nwith her youth and beauty, made it impossible for her to escape the\r\naddresses even of the greatest persons about the court; but Sir John\r\nwas the only happy man who knew how to gain her, being recommended\r\nby his worthy friend, Mr. William Seabright, town clerk of London,\r\nwho had purchased the manor of Besford, in Worcestershire.” This\r\nlady, by her first husband, had four daughters; and by Sir John one\r\nson—John, his successor—and two daughters: Anne, married, first, to\r\nSir Humphrey Ferrars, Knt., of Tamworth, and, secondly, to Philip,\r\nEarl of Chesterfield; and Mary, who married Sir Robert Brooke, of\r\nNacton, Master of the Ceremonies to James I. Sir John died in 1625,\r\naged seventy-seven, and his widow married, thirdly, Lord Kilmurry; and,\r\nfourthly, Thomas, Earl of Kelly.\r\n\r\nBy this great Sir John Pakington the house at Westwood was erected.\r\n“After he had finished his stately structure at Westwood,” it is\r\nrecorded, “Sir John invited the Earl of Northampton, Lord President,\r\nand his countess to a housewarming; and as his lordship was a jovial\r\ncompanion, a train of above one hundred knights and gentlemen\r\naccompanied him, who staid for some time, and at their departure\r\nacknowledged they had met with so kind a reception _that they did not\r\nknow whether they had possessed the place or the place them_. The\r\ndelightful situation of his mansion was what they had never before\r\nseen, the house standing in the middle of a wood cut into twelve large\r\nridings, and at a good distance one riding through all of them: the\r\nwhole surrounded by a park of six or seven miles, with, at the further\r\nend facing the house, an artificial lake of one hundred and twenty-two\r\nacres. His most splendid entertainment was given, however, to James I.\r\nand his queen at Ailsbury, when his majesty honoured him with a visit\r\nafter his arrival from Scotland, before his coronation. Upon this\r\noccasion he set no bounds to expense, thinking it a disparagement to be\r\noutdone by any fellow-subject when such an opportunity offered; and\r\nthe king and court declared that they had never met with a more noble\r\nreception.”\r\n\r\nLloyd, in his “Lives of the Statesmen and Favourites of England since\r\nthe Reformation,” thus speaks of Sir John Pakington:—“His handsome\r\nfeatures look the most, and his neat parts the wisest at court. He\r\ncould smile ladies to his service, and argue statesmen to his design\r\nwith equal ease. His reason was powerful, his beauty more. Never was\r\na brave soul more bravely seated; nature bestowed great parts on him,\r\neducation polished him to an admirable frame of prudence and virtue;\r\nQueen Elizabeth called him her Temperance, and Leicester his Modesty.\r\nIt is a question to this day whether his resolution took the soldiers,\r\nhis prudence the politicians, his compliance the favourites, his\r\ncomplaisance the courtiers, his piety the clergy, his integrity and\r\ncondescension the people, or his knowledge the learned, most. This new\r\ncourt star was a nine days’ wonder, engaging all eyes until it set,\r\nsatisfied with its own glory. He came to court, he said, as Solomon\r\ndid, to see its vanity, and retired, as he did, to repent it. It was\r\nhe who said first, what Bishop Sanderson urged afterwards, _that a\r\nsound faith was the best divinity, a good conscience the best law, and\r\ntemperance the best physic_. Sir John Pakington in Queen Elizabeth’s\r\ntime was virtuous and modest, and Sir John Pakington in King Charles’s\r\ntime loyal and valiant; the one did well, the other suffered so.\r\nGreenham was his favourite, Hammond his; the one had a competent\r\nestate and was contented, the other hath a large one and is noble;\r\nthis suppresseth factions in the kingdom, the other composed them in\r\nthe court, and was called by courtiers Moderation. Westmorland tempted\r\nhis fidelity, and Norfolk his steadfastness, but he died in his bed an\r\nhonest and a happy man.”\r\n\r\nHis son and heir, John Pakington, was created a baronet in 1620, as\r\nSir John Pakington of Ailsbury, where he resided. He married Frances,\r\ndaughter of Sir John Ferrars, of Tamworth (who married, as her second\r\nhusband, the Earl of Leven): by her he had issue one son, John, and\r\ntwo daughters. John died at the early age of twenty-four, during\r\nthe lifetime of his father, and was succeeded in the baronetcy by\r\nhis infant son, who ultimately became possessed of the whole of his\r\ngrandfather’s estates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The North Front._]\r\n\r\nSir John Pakington, the second baronet, who was only five years of\r\nage when he succeeded, was placed under the guardianship of the Lord\r\nKeeper Coventry, “by whose vigilant care of his education, both by\r\ntravel and other advantages, he became a most accomplished gentleman.”\r\nHe was elected M.P. for Worcestershire (15 Charles I.), and when\r\nthe rebellion broke out was member for Ailsbury; and, having on all\r\noccasions given proofs of his fidelity to the Crown and the rights of\r\nthe subject, was intrusted by the King, in 1642, with a commission for\r\narraying men for his service in Worcestershire, on account of which he\r\nwas taken prisoner, committed to the Tower, and fined £5,000; had his\r\nestate sequestered, his house in Buckinghamshire (one of the best in\r\nthat county) levelled with the ground, and such great waste committed\r\nin his woods, that an estimate of the loss, still remaining, in the\r\nhandwriting of his lady, amounts to £20,348. His zeal in the loyal\r\ncause never swerved, for, notwithstanding he had suffered so much for\r\nhis loyalty, he had the courage to join King Charles II. with a troop\r\nof horse at the battle of Worcester, and was taken prisoner there,\r\nyet was so popular that, when afterwards tried for his life, not one\r\nwitness could be produced to swear against him. He was consequently\r\nacquitted and set at liberty, but afterwards fined £7,670, and\r\ncompelled, “for the said fine, to convey the market-house, the tolls,\r\nthe court leet, and certain grounds called Heyden Hill, parcel of the\r\nestate at Ailsbury, to Thomas Scott (who was one of the king’s judges),\r\nand other trustees, for the use of the town, which they kept until\r\nafter the Restoration, when, by a special act of parliament, the said\r\nconveyances were made void.”\r\n\r\nSir John married Dorothy, daughter of his guardian, the Lord Keeper\r\nCoventry, by whom he had issue one son, his successor, and two\r\ndaughters. This lady, Dorothy Pakington, was a woman of remarkable\r\ntalent, and possessed of every acquirement which a natural goodness of\r\ndisposition and the best tutorship could give. To her gifted mind it\r\nis, with all but positive certainty, averred that the world is indebted\r\nfor that admirable book—about which almost as much controversy has\r\nbeen evoked as over the “Letters of Junius”—“The Whole Duty of Man,”\r\nand for the several other works by the same pen. The authorship of\r\n“The Whole Duty of Man” has been variously ascribed to Lady Pakington,\r\nArchbishop Sancroft, Archbishop Frewen, Archbishop Sterne, Bishop Fell,\r\nBishop Chapel, William Allestry, Abraham Woodhead, William Fulman, and\r\nothers; but the weight of probability, and certainly the weight of\r\nevidence, goes to prove that that honour belongs to her ladyship. An\r\nalmost incontrovertible evidence of Lady Pakington being its authoress\r\n“arises from the assertions of Archbishop Dolben, and Bishops Fell and\r\nAllestry, who are said to have declared this of their own knowledge,\r\nafter her death, which she obliged them to keep private during her\r\nlife—_that she really was the author of that best and most masculine\r\nreligious book extant in the English language, ‘The Whole Duty of\r\nMan.’_” Upon a finely sculptured monument in Hampton Lovett Church\r\nshe and her husband are recorded in these words:—“In the same church\r\nlyes Sir John Pakington, Kt. and Bart., and his lady, grandfather and\r\ngrandmother to the said Sir John. The first, try’d for his life and\r\nspent the greatest part of his fortune in adhering to King Charles I.;\r\nand the latter justly reputed the authoress of the Whole Duty of Man,\r\nwho was exemplary for her great piety and goodness.” Sir John died in\r\n1680, and was succeeded by his son—\r\n\r\nSir John Pakington, who, having married Margaret, daughter of Sir John\r\nKeys, died in 1688, and was in turn succeeded by his only child, Sir\r\nJohn Pakington, the fourth baronet, who, when only nineteen years\r\nof age, became M.P. for Worcestershire, and so remained, with one\r\nexception, when he voluntarily withdrew himself, to the time of his\r\ndeath. He was “a strenuous asserter of the rights and liberties of\r\nthe country,” and in 1702 preferred that remarkable complaint against\r\nthe Bishop of Worcester and his son for unduly interfering in the\r\nelections, which resulted in the Bishop being removed by the Queen from\r\nhis office of almoner, and other proceedings being taken. Sir John\r\nmarried, first, Frances, daughter of Sir Henry Parker; and, secondly,\r\nHester, daughter and sole heiress of Sir Herbert Perrott. By his first\r\nmarriage he had issue two sons, who died young, and two daughters, one\r\nof whom married Viscount Tracy. By his second wife, Hester Perrott, Sir\r\nJohn had a son, Sir Herbert Perrott Pakington, by whom, on his death in\r\n1727, he was succeeded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Principal Front._]\r\n\r\nSir Herbert Perrott Pakington, fifth baronet, M.P. for Worcestershire,\r\nmarried, in 1721, Elizabeth, daughter of John Conyers, Esq., of\r\nWalthamstow, and by her had issue two sons—John and Herbert Perrott,\r\neach of whom enjoyed the baronetcy—and two daughters. Dying in 1748,\r\nhe was succeeded by his son—\r\n\r\nSir John Pakington, as sixth baronet, who married Mary, daughter of\r\nHenry Bray, Esq., of Bromyard, but, dying in 1762 without issue, was\r\nsucceeded by his brother—\r\n\r\nSir Herbert Perrott Pakington, as seventh baronet. Sir Herbert married,\r\nin 1759, Elizabeth, daughter of Cæsar Hawkins, Esq., and widow of\r\nHerbert Wylde, Esq., of Ludlow, and by her had issue two sons and four\r\ndaughters—viz. John, his successor; Thomas, who died without issue;\r\nDorothy; Anne; Louisa; and Elizabeth, who married William Russell,\r\nEsq., of Powick, Worcestershire, by which marriage she had an only son,\r\nthe present Lord Hampton, who, as will be shown, ultimately succeeded\r\nto the estates. Sir Herbert Perrott Pakington died in 1795, and was\r\nsucceeded, as eighth and last baronet, by his son—\r\n\r\nSir John Pakington, D.C.L. This gentleman was born in 1760, and\r\ndied without issue, and unmarried, in 1830, when the title became\r\nextinct, and the estates passed to his nephew, John Somerset Russell,\r\nEsq. (son of his sister, Elizabeth Pakington, by her marriage with\r\nWilliam Russell, Esq., of Powick), who at once assumed the family name\r\nof Pakington in lieu of that of Russell, and became John Somerset\r\nPakington, Esq., and is the present noble owner of Westwood.\r\n\r\nThe Right Hon. Lord Hampton—the first peer of the family—was born in\r\n1799, and, as we have stated, is the son of William Russell, Esq., by\r\nhis wife, Elizabeth Pakington. He succeeded, as John Somerset Russell,\r\nto the estates of his uncle, Sir John Pakington, in 1830, and assumed\r\nthe patronymic of Pakington in lieu of his own name of Russell. He\r\nwas educated at Eton and at Oriel College, Oxford. In 1837 he was\r\nelected M.P. for Droitwich, which town he continued to represent until\r\n1874, when, after nearly forty years of able, useful, and faithful\r\npublic servitude, he was defeated at the general election. In 1846 he\r\nwas created a baronet, by the name of Sir John Somerset Pakington,\r\nof Westwood Park. In 1852 Sir John held office as Secretary of State\r\nfor the Colonies; in 1858-9 was a member of the Committee of Council\r\nfor Education; in 1858-9, and again in 1866-7, was first Lord of the\r\nAdmiralty; and in 1867-8 was Secretary of State for War. In 1874\r\nhe was created Baron Hampton, of Hampton Lovett and of Westwood, in\r\nthe county of Worcester, in the peerage of the United Kingdom. Lord\r\nHampton, who is a Privy Councillor, a G.C.B., an Hon. D.C.L. of Oxford,\r\nan Elder Brother of the Trinity House, a Magistrate, for many years\r\nChairman of the County Quarter Sessions, and Deputy Lieutenant of the\r\ncounty, has married three times: first, in 1822, Mary (who died in\r\n1843), daughter of Moreton Aglionby Slaney, Esq., by whom he has issue\r\nliving one son, the Hon. John Slaney Pakington (heir to the title and\r\nestates), who was born in 1826, and married, in 1849, the Lady Diana\r\nBoyle, daughter of the Earl of Glasgow; secondly, in 1844, Augusta\r\nAnne (who died in 1848), daughter of the Right Rev. George Murray,\r\nD.D., Bishop of Rochester, by whom he has issue living one son, the\r\nHon. Herbert Perrott Murray Pakington, born in 1848; thirdly, in 1851,\r\nAugusta, daughter of Thomas Champion de Crespigny, Esq., and widow of\r\nColonel Davis, M.P., of Elmley Park, Worcestershire, by whom he has no\r\nissue.\r\n\r\nLord Hampton is by no means entirely, or even mainly, indebted for\r\nrenown to the high positions he has occupied, although they are among\r\nthe very highest. There have been, of late years, few projects designed\r\nand calculated to benefit mankind to which he has not been, in some\r\nway, a contributor; foremost, indeed, he has always been in every good\r\nwork that may lessen suffering, extend social advantages, and advance\r\nthe cause of education and religion. The descendant and representative\r\nof a race that has for centuries given to England true patriots, in the\r\nbest sense of the word, he has been a powerful benefactor wherever his\r\ninfluence could reach.\r\n\r\nThe arms of Lord Hampton, who is patron of the living of Hampton\r\nLovett, are—per chevron, _sable_ and _argent_; in chief three mullets,\r\n_or_, and in base as many garbs, one and two, _gules_. Crest—an\r\nelephant, _or_. Supporters—dexter, an elephant, _or_; sinister, a\r\ntalbot, _argent_; each charged on the shoulder with a mullet, pierced,\r\n_sable_. Motto—“Fidelis et audax.” His seats are Westwood Park,\r\nDroitwich, and Powick Court, Worcester.\r\n\r\nThe pretty little Church of Hampton Lovett—one of the burial-places\r\nof the family—lies about two miles from the mansion, from which it\r\nis approached by a delightful drive across the park and the outlying\r\nportions of the estate. The Church is charmingly situated, and\r\npossesses some features of interest. It consists of a nave, chancel,\r\nand north aisle, with a tower at the west end, and contains a modern\r\nstone pulpit of exquisite design; and, besides recent stained-glass\r\nwindows, there are some good remains of ancient armorial stained glass,\r\nincluding the royal and Pakington arms, &c. In the chancel, which is\r\npaved with encaustic tiles, is a piscina on the south side, and on the\r\nnorth a fine canopied tomb, on which has been placed an explanatory\r\nbrass plate, bearing the inscription, “This monument was discovered\r\nbehind another, which was removed to the west wall of the side chapel,\r\nduring the repair of the church in 1859. Though much mutilated,\r\nthe design was preserved, and the heraldic escutcheons (which were\r\nuninjured) show it to have been erected to the memory of Sir John\r\nPakington, Kt., of Hampton Lovett, and Anne, his wife, daughter of\r\nHenry Dacres, sometime Sheriff of London. He was eminent as a Lawyer\r\nand a Judge, and amongst other honours received a grant of the lands of\r\nWestwood from King Henry VIII.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Hampton Lovett Church._]\r\n\r\nThe monument here noted as being removed in 1859 stands against the\r\nwest wall of the north aisle, or “side chapel.” It is a fine piece of\r\nsculpture in the style of Roubilliac, with a semi-recumbent figure of\r\nSt. John. It bears this highly interesting inscription:—“Here lyes\r\nSir John Pakington, Kt. and Bart., aged 55 years, an indulgent father\r\nto his children, a kind master to his servants, charitable to the poor,\r\nloyal to the king, and faithful to his country. Who served in many\r\nparliaments for the county of Worcester speaking his mind there without\r\nreserve; neither fearing nor flattering those in power, but despising\r\nall their offers of title and preferment upon base and dishonourable\r\nterms of competition. He was chosen Recorder for the City of Worcester\r\nthe 21st day of February, 1725, in the room of Other, Earl of Plymouth,\r\ndeceased, which few ever enjoyed the honour of under the degree of a\r\nPeer of the Realm. He dyed the 13th of Augt., 1727. In the same church\r\nlyes Sir John Pakington, Kt. and Bart., and his lady, grandfather and\r\ngrandmother to the said Sir John. The fyrst try’d for his life and\r\nspent the greatest part of his fortune in adhering to King Charles I.,\r\nand the latter justly reputed the Authoress of The Whole Duty of Man,\r\nwho was exemplary for her great piety and goodness.” There is also a\r\ntablet to Dorothy Anne, second daughter and co-heiress of Sir Herbert\r\nPerrott Pakington, 1846; her father, 1785; her mother, Dame Elizabeth\r\nPakington, daughter of Sir Cæsar Hawkins, 1783; and Sir John Pakington,\r\n1830; and one to the memory of Mary, the first wife of Lord Hampton,\r\nand daughter of Moreton Aglionby Slaney, Esq., who was born in 1799 and\r\ndied in 1843.\r\n\r\nIn the churchyard are some venerable yew-trees, and near the path is a\r\ntall and lovely cross, of simple but effective design, restored by Lord\r\nHampton in memory of his second wife. At the head of the lofty shaft\r\nis a crocketed cross bearing the sacred monogram: beneath this are\r\nbeautifully sculptured figures of the four evangelists under crocketed\r\ncanopies. At the base are the four evangelistic symbols, and beneath is\r\nthe inscription, “To the beloved memory of Augusta Anne, second wife\r\nof Sir John Pakington, Bart., this cross was restored A.D. MDCCCXLIX.\r\nShe was the daughter of George Murray, Lord Bishop of Rochester, and\r\ndeparted this life in the true faith of Christ, February xxiii.,\r\nMDCCCXLVIII., after the birth of her second child, and in the XXXIST\r\nyear of her age. + Not my will but thine be done.”\r\n\r\nWe said, at the commencement of our notice, that Westwood Park lies\r\na couple of miles or so from Droitwich, and it therefore behoves us,\r\nbefore closing, to say a word or two about that town, and the “healing\r\nwaters” which are its great attraction and blessing.\r\n\r\nThe neighbourhood of Westwood and Droitwich is very charming, the\r\nwalks and drives are beautiful, and the whole locality is rich in\r\nhistoric lore and in antiquated traditions. Venerable church towers,\r\npretty villages, homely yet comfortable cottages, fruitful orchards,\r\nproductive meadows and corn lands, delicious lanes rich in wild\r\nflowers, wooded slopes, broad and narrow rivers (notably, majestic\r\nSevern), are in view from any ascent. But the eye takes in more than\r\nthese: ancient mansions are numerous; among them several of our\r\njustly boasted baronial halls. There are houses of prosperous gentry,\r\nand picturesque dwellings of wood and plaster of a long-ago time.\r\nIndeed, the rich and the poor may be equally content with their lot\r\nin this fair, fertile, and rarely gifted locality. It is suggestive\r\nof prosperity, and indicative of content, although the whistle of the\r\nrailroad is often heard, and the mysterious wires of the telegraph\r\nskirt the principal highways. The distant views are even more graceful\r\nand majestic than those near at hand. Grand old Malvern, the Abberley\r\nHills, the Clees, the “hunchbacked Wrekin,” the Clents, the Lickeys,\r\nTardebigge, Astwood, and even the far-off Cotswolds, may be seen from\r\nany of the neighbouring heights.\r\n\r\nDroitwich itself is a town devoid of beauty or interest, but it is\r\nsituated in a lovely district, with a glorious country around it, and a\r\nneighbourhood rich in scenery and in picturesque localities. Internally\r\nthe town is a “land of many waters,” its brine wells, from which\r\nthousands of gallons per hour are constantly being pumped up, producing\r\nan enormous quantity of salt, which is sent out to supply the tables,\r\nand the workshops, and the manufactories of our native population, as\r\nwell as to help to render our fields more prolific, and find employment\r\nfor nearly the whole of its population. Droitwich, there can be no\r\ndoubt, is a town of Roman foundation, and its salt-works were worked by\r\nthat people on precisely the same system of evaporation in vats as now.\r\nA portion of an interesting Romano-British tesselated pavement—part of\r\na Roman villa—was discovered here some few years ago, and is preserved\r\nat Worcester. It is indisputable evidence of Droitwich and its springs\r\nbeing known to the Romans. Although small, and mainly depending for\r\nits prosperity on its salt-works, Droitwich has always, since the\r\nConquest, been a place of importance, and until the passing of the\r\nReform Bill sent two members to Parliament; it now sends only one. It\r\nis governed by a mayor and corporation, possesses abundance of schools\r\nand charitable institutions, has spacious churches and other places of\r\nworship, and has every facility of railway and canal communication.\r\n\r\nThe main feature of the place, however, is its recently re-established\r\nBrine Baths. The efficacy of the saline springs was first brought into\r\nnotice of late years during the sad visitation of cholera to the town\r\nin 1831. In that year, when numbers of the inhabitants were being\r\ncarried off by the pest, some parties, in their agonies of distress and\r\ntheir desire to find means of saving the lives of those near and dear\r\nto them, dipped the sufferers into the warm brine in the evaporating\r\nvats of the salt-works, and this was found to produce such marvellous\r\nresults that it was generally adopted; indeed, it is affirmed that all\r\nwho were so treated, even those in a state of collapse, recovered from\r\nthe attack. The fame of these cures spread far and wide, and numbers\r\nbeing brought there for that and other complaints, it was determined\r\nto form a bath. This was done, and the efficacy of the brine firmly\r\nestablished. Later on a company was formed; but although baths were\r\nerected, and patients were not wanting to visit them, the whole matter\r\nfell into a state of unfortunate inanition, despite the attention\r\nwhich had been directed to the place by Dr. Hastings and other men of\r\neminence. In 1871 Mr. Bainbrigge, F.R.C.S., a medical man of enlarged\r\nexperience and skill, visited the baths for the purpose of examining,\r\nand analyzing, and reporting upon their properties and efficacy.\r\nThe result was, that a joint-stock company for the erection of new\r\nbaths, the opening up of the curative properties of the waters, and\r\nthe development of Droitwich into an inland sea-bathing place, was\r\nformed, and baths were erected. These baths were opened in 1873, and\r\nsince then the whole affair has passed into the hands of a few private\r\nindividuals. The old George Hotel, with its pleasant garden (closely\r\nadjoining the bath), has been converted into a private boarding-house,\r\nand about eight acres of pleasure-grounds and gardens, with here and\r\nthere a pleasant residence attached, have been added and laid out with\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\nThe visitor will find many objects of interest in Droitwich; and many\r\nplaces of note—Whitely Court, the truly “Stately Home” of the Earl of\r\nDudley, being one of them—are within easy drive of the place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMELBOURNE HALL.\r\n\r\n\r\nMELBOURNE HALL is interesting from the curious and unique character of\r\nits gardens rather than from the elegance or beauty of the house; but\r\nit possesses in its historical associations, and its connection with\r\nfamous families, a larger share of importance than falls to the lot\r\nof many more pretentious places. It is to the history of the “Home,”\r\nand its charming and curious grounds, as well as to the history of the\r\nnoble families to which it has belonged, that we purpose to direct\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nMelbourne itself—from which is derived the title of Viscount\r\nMelbourne, as well as the name of the thriving city of Melbourne,\r\nin our far-distant dominion of Australia—is a small manufacturing\r\nand market town in Derbyshire, being situated on the borders of\r\nLeicestershire, and lying in the charming valley of the Trent. It\r\nis only eight miles from Derby, from which place it is conveniently\r\nreached by a branch railway; it is, therefore, now, since the opening\r\nof this line, of easy access from that great centre of railway traffic.\r\nThe town contains some goodly manufactories of silk and Lisle-thread\r\ngloves, figured lace, &c., for which it is much noted; and it is also\r\nwell known for its productive gardens and nurseries. It is but seven\r\nmiles from famous Ashby-de-la-Zouch, the scene of Sir Walter Scott’s\r\nundying “Ivanhoe,” and where the splendid ruins of the grand old\r\ncastle of the Zouches still stand in all their beauty, and are among\r\nthe most majestic and picturesque in the kingdom, Kenilworth scarcely\r\nexcepted. Melbourne is also within some few miles of Calke Abbey, the\r\nelegant seat of Sir John Harpur Crewe, Bart.; and not much farther\r\nfrom Donington Park, the seat of the late Marquis of Hastings and the\r\npresent Earl of Loudoun; Staunton Harold, the charming residence of\r\nEarl Ferrers; and Elvaston Castle, the ancient seat of the Earl of\r\nHarrington, whose gardens are much of the same character as those we\r\nare about to describe. Indeed, the whole district, turn in whatever\r\ndirection one may, is full of interest and beauty.\r\n\r\nAt Melbourne, as stated in Domesday Book, King Edward VI. held “six\r\ncarucates of land for geld. Land for six ploughs. The King has one\r\nplough there, and twenty villanes, and six bordars, having five\r\nploughs. A priest and a church there, and one mill of three shillings,\r\nand twenty-four acres of meadow. Wood, pasturable, one mile in length\r\nand half a mile in breadth. In the time of King Edward it was worth\r\nten pounds; now six pounds; yet it renders ten.” It was from very\r\nearly times a royal manor, and was granted by King John to Hugh de\r\nBeauchamp, whose eldest son gave it in marriage with his daughter to\r\nWilliam Fitz-Geoffrey, but within a short period it again reverted to\r\nthe Crown. By Henry III. it was, in 1229, granted to Philip de Marc,\r\nfrom whom it again passed into the sovereign’s hands. The manor and\r\ncastle were afterwards held by Edmund, Earl of Lancaster, brother to\r\nEdward I., and passed to his son Thomas, by whom they were conveyed\r\nto King Edward II., who granted them to Robert de Holland. This\r\nperson was summoned to Parliament as a baron, but having joined in\r\nthe insurrection, he surrendered himself at Derby, and was ultimately\r\nbeheaded for high treason, and his estates were confiscated. They\r\nwere then held by Henry, Earl of Lancaster, who had a grant of a\r\nmarket, &c.; and they continued attached to the earldom and duchy\r\nof Lancaster until 1604, when they were given by King James to the\r\nEarl of Nottingham, who soon afterwards conveyed them to the Earl of\r\nHuntingdon, from whom they passed to the Marquis of Hastings.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Henry V. the country around the royal manor and castle\r\nof Melbourne sent many warriors to the battle of Agincourt; and\r\nalthough it may be a question whether the hills in the neighbourhood,\r\nwhich are called “Derby Hills” to this day, or those in the Peak, at\r\nthe north end of the county, are intended in the ballad—\r\n\r\n  “Recruit me Cheshire and Lancashire,\r\n    And Derby Hills that are so free;\r\n  No marry’d man or widow’s son:\r\n    For no widow’s curse shall go with me.\r\n\r\n  “They recruited Cheshire and Lancashire,\r\n    And Derby Hills that are so free;\r\n  No marry’d man or widow’s son:\r\n    Yet there was a jovial bold company”—\r\n\r\ncertain it is that Derbyshire men were among the most valiant in\r\nthat battle, and that John, Duke of Bourbon, who was taken prisoner,\r\nwas brought to Melbourne Castle, and there kept in close confinement\r\nfor nineteen years. Melbourne Castle, now entirely destroyed, is\r\ntraditionally said to have been founded by Alfred the Great in 900.\r\nThere appears, however, to be no mention of it until 1307. In 1319 it\r\npassed into the hands of Thomas de Holland, who obtained a license to\r\ncrenellate the place in the fourth year of Edward II. In 1322 “John de\r\nHardshull was joined in the governorship of the castles of Melbourne\r\nand Donington,” and a few years later it became the property of Thomas,\r\nEarl of Lancaster. In 1414. as already stated, John, Duke of Bourbon,\r\nwas prisoner here under Sir Ralph Shirley, the governor of the castle,\r\nand afterwards under Nicholas Montgomery, the then governor. It is\r\nsaid to have been dismantled by order of Margaret, Queen of Henry VI.\r\nIt was, it seems, repaired by Edward IV., and in Henry VIII.’s reign\r\nis said to have been in “good reparation.” In 1602 a survey was made,\r\nby order of Queen Elizabeth, by Thomas Fanshawe, then auditor of the\r\nduchy of Lancaster, in which it is said, “Her Majesty hath a faire and\r\nancient castle which she keepeth in her own hands, and that Gilbert,\r\nEarl of Shrewsbury, was then constable of the same and bailiffe there\r\nby letters patent during his life, with the annual fee of £10.” It\r\nafterwards came into the hands of the Huntingdons, and was suffered to\r\nfall into decay. The site now belongs to Mr. Hastings.\r\n\r\nMelbourne was formerly in the honour of Tutbury, its officers in that\r\nhonour being the “Steward of Melbourne,” the “Constable of Melbourne\r\nCastle,” the “Keeper of Melbourne Park,” and the “Bayliffe of\r\nMelbourne.”\r\n\r\nThe Bishops of Carlisle had formerly a palace and a park at Melbourne,\r\nand occasionally resided there, the palace being near the church,\r\ntolerably close to the castle, and on the site of what is now Melbourne\r\nHall. After being long held on lease from the see, it ultimately became\r\nthe property of the Coke family. An arch, in the early English style,\r\nconjectured to have belonged to the old nunnery near the church, was\r\ntaken down about 1821.\r\n\r\nThe Cokes, to whom Melbourne Castle and Hall belonged, are an\r\nold Derbyshire family, whose estates lay principally at Trusley,\r\nMarchington, Thurvaston, Pinxton, Egginton, and other places, The head\r\nof the family, in the forty-third year of the reign of Edward III.,\r\nwas Hugh Coke, son of Robert Coke. His eldest son, Thomas, married\r\nElizabeth, daughter and co-heiress of Thomas Odingsells. By this lady,\r\nwho brought the Trusley estates into the family, he had issue a son,\r\nWilliam Coke, who, marrying Joan, daughter of John Hilton, by her had\r\nissue a son, William Coke, who, by his first wife, Cicely Brentwood,\r\nhad a son, also William Coke, by whom he was succeeded. This William\r\nCoke married a daughter of Sir Ralph Longford, by whom he had issue\r\nhis son and successor, William Coke, who, marrying Dorothy, daughter\r\nof Ralph Fitzherbert, of Tissington, had issue two sons—John and\r\nRichard—and six daughters, viz. Elizabeth, Dorothy, Margaret, Anne,\r\nEllen, and Mabel. He was succeeded by his son, Richard Coke, who\r\nmarried Mary, daughter and sole heiress to Thomas Sacheverell, by\r\nwhom he acquired considerable property. By this marriage Richard Coke\r\nhad issue six sons—viz. Sir Francis Coke, of Trusley, Knt.; Sir John\r\nCoke, Secretary of State; Thomas Coke; Philip Coke; George Coke, Bishop\r\nof Hereford and Bristol; and Robert Coke—and four daughters, viz.\r\nElizabeth, Mary, Margaret, and Dorothy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Arms of Coke._]\r\n\r\nSir John Coke, the first of the family who settled at Melbourne, was\r\nborn in 1563, and greatly distinguished himself by his learning. He was\r\nsuccessively Professor of Rhetoric at Cambridge, Secretary of the Navy,\r\nMaster of the Court of Requests, Secretary of State to King Charles I.,\r\nand for several years a member of Parliament, where he took an active\r\nand dignified part in the debates. Sir John, who died in 1644, was\r\nmarried twice: first, to Mary, daughter of John Powell, of Presteign,\r\nby whom he had issue; and, secondly, to Joan, daughter of Alderman Sir\r\nJohn Lee, Knt., and widow of Alderman Gore. He was succeeded by his son\r\n(by his first wife), Thomas Coke, whose son (by his wife Mary, daughter\r\nof —— Pope, of Wolferston), John Coke, married Mary, daughter of Sir\r\nThomas Leventhorpe, by whom, with other issue, he had three sons, one\r\nof whom, the Right Hon. Thomas Coke, became Vice-Chamberlain to Queen\r\nAnne and King George I., and served in Parliament for many years.\r\nThis gentleman was so great a favourite with his sovereign, Queen\r\nAnne, that she presented to him, among other marks of royal favour,\r\nthe two splendid vases now placed in the grounds of Melbourne Hall.\r\nBy his first wife, Mary, daughter of Philip, Earl of Chesterfield,\r\nhe had issue two daughters—Mary, married to Viscount Southwell, and\r\nElizabeth, married to Bache Thornhill, Esq.; and by his second wife,\r\nthe Hon. Mary Hale, sister of Bernard Hale, Esq., one of the maids of\r\nhonour to Queen Anne, he had issue, with others, a daughter, Charlotte,\r\nwho became his sole heiress on the death of her brother, George Lewis\r\nCoke.\r\n\r\nThis Charlotte Coke married, in 1740, Sir Matthew Lamb, Bart., of\r\nBrockett Hall, Hertfordshire, nephew and co-heir of Peniston Lamb,\r\nEsq., and was the mother, by him, of Sir Peniston Lamb, Bart., who\r\nwas created Baron Melbourne, Baron Kilmore, and Viscount Melbourne of\r\nMelbourne. His wife was Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Ralph Milbanke, by\r\nwhom he had four sons and three daughters—viz. the Hon. Peniston Lamb,\r\nwho died unmarried; the Hon. William Lamb, who succeeded him; the Hon.\r\nFrederick James Lamb, who also succeeded to the titles and estates; the\r\nHon. George Lamb, M.P. (well known for his literary attainments), who\r\nmarried Mdlle. Caroline Rosalie St. Jules; the Hon. Emily Mary Lamb,\r\nmarried, first, to Earl Cowper, and, secondly, to Viscount Palmerston;\r\nthe Hon. Harriette Lamb; and a daughter who died in infancy. Lord\r\nMelbourne, who died in 1828, was succeeded in his titles and estates,\r\nas second viscount, by his second son, William, who, after holding many\r\nimportant posts, and taking an active part in the administration of\r\nthis country, became Prime Minister. He was born in 1779, and educated\r\nat Eton, Cambridge, and Glasgow, and in 1804 was called to the bar. In\r\n1805 he entered Parliament, and in the same year married Lady Caroline\r\nPonsonby, daughter of the Earl of Bessborough, a lady who became, as\r\n“Lady Caroline Lamb,” distinguished in the literary circles of the day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Melbourne Hall, from the Garden._]\r\n\r\nIn 1818 Mr. Lamb became Secretary for Ireland under Canning, and so\r\ncontinued under the next two administrations. In 1828 he succeeded to\r\nthe titles and estates as second Viscount Melbourne, Baron Melbourne,\r\nand Baron Kilmore. In 1830 his lordship became Home Secretary, and\r\nin July, 1834, was made Prime Minister, but only retained that\r\noffice till the following November. In 1835 he again became Prime\r\nMinister, and so continued until 1841. Being Premier at the time\r\nof the Queen’s accession to the throne, Lord Melbourne became her\r\nMajesty’s confidential adviser. His lordship died, in 1848, without\r\nsurviving issue, when the title passed to his brother, the Hon.\r\nFrederick Lamb, who had been, in 1839, created Baron Beauvale, and\r\nhad held many important posts. His lordship, who married the Countess\r\nAdela, daughter of Count Maltzan, Prussian Ambassador at Vienna, died\r\nwithout issue, when the title became extinct. The estates then passed\r\nto his only surviving sister, the Hon. Emily Mary, married, first,\r\nto Earl Cowper, and, secondly, to the late Prime Minister, Viscount\r\nPalmerston. This lady was born in 1787, and married, in 1805, Peter\r\nLeopold Louis Francis, fifth Earl Cowper, by whom she had issue—George\r\nAugustus Frederick, Viscount Fordwich, who became sixth Earl Cowper;\r\nLady Emily Caroline Catherine, married, in 1830, to the present Earl\r\nof Shaftesbury; the Hon. William Francis Cowper, who, on the death of\r\nLady Palmerston, in 1869, became the owner, under his will, of Lord\r\nPalmerston’s estates, and assumed the additional surname of Temple\r\n(Cowper-Temple); the Hon. Charles Spencer Cowper, who married the\r\nLady Blessington, and afterwards Jessie Mary, only surviving child\r\nof Colonel Clinton McLean; and the Lady Frances Elizabeth. Earl\r\nCowper dying in 1837, Lady Cowper, in 1839, was married to Viscount\r\nPalmerston, who, dying in 1865, left her again a widow, and his title\r\nbecame extinct. At Lady Palmerston’s death, in 1869, her estates passed\r\nto her grandson, the present Earl Cowper, who now owns Melbourne Hall\r\nand its surrounding estates.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Henry John Temple, third Viscount Palmerston and Baron Temple\r\nof Mount Temple, was the son of Henry, second Viscount Palmerston,\r\nby his second wife, Mary, daughter of Benjamin Mee, of Bath. He was\r\nborn in 1784, and was educated at Harrow and at St. John’s College,\r\nCambridge, and succeeded his father in the titles and estates as third\r\nViscount Palmerston and Baron Temple in 1802, and entered Parliament\r\nin 1807, from which time his name was intimately mixed up with the\r\npolitical history of this country. He successively became a Knight of\r\nthe Garter and a Knight Grand Cross of the Bath, and, among other\r\noffices, Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, Constable of Dover Castle,\r\nElder Brother of Trinity House, Lord Rector of the University of\r\nGlasgow, a Lord of the Admiralty, Secretary at War, Foreign Secretary,\r\nand Home Secretary. In 1855 he became Prime Minister, and so continued\r\nuntil 1858. In 1859 he again became Prime Minister, and died whilst\r\nholding that office in 1865. The title then became extinct. Lord\r\nPalmerston by his will, dated November 22nd, 1864, left his real\r\nand leasehold estates in England and Ireland to Lady Palmerston for\r\nlife, and after her decease to her second son, the Right Hon. William\r\nFrancis Cowper. The will expressed an earnest wish that Mr. Cowper,\r\nupon coming into possession of the estates, should immediately apply\r\nfor a royal license to take and use, for himself and his descendants,\r\nthe surname of Temple, either in substitution for, or in addition to,\r\nthat of Cowper, but so that Temple should be the final name; and the\r\nfamily arms of Temple to be quartered with those of Cowper. This was\r\naccordingly done. The arms of Lord Palmerston were—quarterly, first\r\nand fourth, _or_, an eagle displayed, _sable_; second and third,\r\n_argent_, two bars, _sable_, each charged with three martlets, _or_.\r\nSupporters—dexter, a lion reguardant, _pæan_; and sinister, a horse\r\nreguardant, _argent_, maned, tailed, and hoofed, _or_. Crest—a hound\r\nsejant, _sable_, collared, _or_. Motto—“Flecti non frangi.”\r\n\r\nIt is a somewhat curious circumstance, as will have been gleaned, and\r\none worth noting, that Melbourne Hall became the seat, within twenty\r\nyears, of two Prime Ministers, and that the titles of each, Lords\r\nMelbourne and Palmerston, have become extinct.\r\n\r\nThe present noble owner of Melbourne Hall and its surrounding estates\r\nis the Right Hon. Francis Thomas De Grey Cowper, seventh Earl Cowper,\r\nViscount Fordwich, Baron Cowper, Baron Butler, and Baron Dingwall, and\r\na Baronet. His lordship (who is grandson of Lady Palmerston) was born\r\nin 1834, and is the son of George Augustus Frederick, sixth earl, by\r\nhis wife, Anne Florence, Baroness Lucas, daughter of the second Earl De\r\nGrey, and was educated at Harrow and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he\r\nproceeded M.A. in 1855. He succeeded to the titles and estates on the\r\ndeath of his father in 1856, and from 1871 to 1874 was Captain and Gold\r\nShell of H.M. Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms. In 1870 Earl Cowper married\r\nKatrine Cecilia, daughter of Lord William Compton, heir-presumptive\r\nto the Marquis of Northampton, by whom, however, he has no issue, the\r\nheir-presumptive being his brother, the Hon. Henry Frederick Cowper,\r\nM.P.\r\n\r\nThe arms of Earl Cowper are—_argent_, three martlets, _gules_; on a\r\nchief engrailed, of the last, three annulets, _or_. Crest—a lion’s\r\njamb erased, _or_, holding a cherry branch, _vert_, fructed, _gules_.\r\nSupporters—two dun horses, close cropped (except a tuft on the\r\nwithers) and docked, a large blaze down the face, a black list down\r\nthe back, and three white feet, viz. both hind and the near fore foot.\r\nMotto—“Tuum est.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Gardens and Yew Tunnel._]\r\n\r\nThe Gardens and Grounds of Melbourne Hall are its chief attractions\r\nThey are a curious and elegant relic of the old style of horticulture,\r\nwhich was brought from Holland by William III., consisting of groves,\r\nfountains, statues, &c., and are of the most strikingly peculiar\r\ncharacter. In one place, on entering, the visitor finds himself in the\r\nLover’s Walk, a literal tunnel (the outside, of which is shown in our\r\nview of the grounds) formed of very aged yew-trees, arched and netted\r\nand intergrown one with another, only here and there pierced by rays\r\nof light. In another he finds himself by the side of a basin, in the\r\ncentre of which a fountain is ever playing; while in its clear waters\r\nmagnificent carp are lazily swimming or basking in the sun. In another\r\nplace he comes upon a “cool grot”—a mineral spring, over which is\r\nerected a charming rustic grotto of spars, shells, stalactites, and\r\nother natural objects, and bearing on a marble tablet lines by the Hon.\r\nGeorge Lamb:—\r\n\r\n  “Rest, weary stranger, in this shady cave,\r\n  And taste, if languid, of the mineral wave;\r\n  There’s virtue in the draught; for health that flies\r\n  From crowded cities and their smoky skies,\r\n  Here lends her power from every glade and hill,\r\n  Strength to the breeze, and medicine to the rill.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Gardens, as seen from the Hall._]\r\n\r\nThe lawn in front of the mansion is laid out in ornamental beds, filled\r\nwith the choicest flowers, and dotted over with groups, single figures,\r\nvases, &c., of fine sculpture, of which it may be interesting to note\r\nthat the pair of black figures only cost, about the year 1630, £30,\r\nand the Perseus and Andromeda £45. At the opposite side of the grounds\r\nfrom the house is an alcove of elaborate design in wrought-iron,\r\nbearing the arms of Coke, which, with the central basin and fountain,\r\nis shown in our engraving of the gardens as seen from the hall. The\r\nScotch firs which form the background of the gardens were planted in\r\nthe time of William III., the trunks being, in many instances, 80 feet\r\nin height, and 13 or 14 feet in circumference. One of these Scotch\r\nfirs, which fell in the spring of 1875, was known to be one hundred and\r\nseventy-six years old; its dimensions were extraordinary. They were\r\nas follows:—Height, 82 feet; length of butt, 39 feet; circumference\r\nat eight feet from the ground, 10 feet 8 inches; circumference at\r\nthirty-nine feet from the ground, 9 feet 2 inches; total contents of\r\ntimber, 340 cubic feet. Leading in a south-easterly direction from the\r\nparterred lawn, the gardens become entirely changed in character, and\r\nthe visitor wanders through sylvan walks, bounded on either side by\r\nimpenetrable yew hedges, which intersect each other in every direction,\r\nat every turn coming upon a fine piece of sculpture, or rippling\r\nstream, or bubbling fountain.\r\n\r\nOne of the walks leads to a gentle eminence at the junction of three\r\nsplendid glades, with gigantic lime hedges, in the centre of which\r\nis placed the enormous bronzed vase of lead—one of the finest pieces\r\nof modelling in existence—called the “Seasons,” which, with another\r\nexquisite, though plainer, vase placed almost in close contiguity, was\r\npresented by Queen Anne to her Vice-Chamberlain, Thomas Coke. On the\r\npedestals is the monogram, “T. C.,” of the Thomas Coke to whom they\r\nwere given. On occasion of its being repaired, in 1840, the following\r\ninscription, written by Mr. H. Fox, was placed in its interior:—\r\n\r\n                            HOC SIMULACRUM\r\n                          EX DONO ANNÆ REGINÆ\r\n                THOMA COKE ARMIGERO DOMINI CUBICULARII\r\n                            VICEM FUNGENTE\r\n                                POSITUM\r\n                      E LOCO MOTUM ET AD VETEREM\r\n                           NORMAM RESTITUTUM\r\n                     GULIELMUS VICECOMES MELBOURNE\r\n                   PRINCEPS DOMINORUM REGII THESAURI\r\n                               REPOSUIT\r\n                       ANNO VICTORIÆ REG. QUARTO\r\n                          ANNO CHRISTI 1840.\r\n\r\nThe Terrace Walk, formed so as to overlook the magnificent lake, is\r\na pleasant and favourite promenade for visitors, and commands some\r\ncharming views of the grounds, the lake, the church, and neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThe Lake, or Pool, as it is commonly called, is nearly twenty-two\r\nacres in extent, and is beautifully wooded on its banks, and, with its\r\nisland, the swans which are always sailing on its surface, and the\r\npleasure-boats frequently gliding about, forms a beautiful picture from\r\nwhatever point it is viewed. The gardens, it may be added, cover an\r\nextent of nearly twenty acres of ground; and it is worth noting that\r\non the wall near the Conservatory and the Muniment-room is the finest\r\nand largest _Wistaria_ in existence—its extent along the wall being no\r\nless than two hundred and sixty-four feet.\r\n\r\nIn the hall itself is a splendid collection of pictures, including\r\nmany very rare examples—family portraits, principally of the old\r\ncelebrities of the Coke family and others. In this house Baxter wrote\r\nhis “Saint’s Rest;” and here many distinguished men have at one time\r\nor other resided. Of this Baxter himself thus wrote:—“The second book\r\nwhich I wrote (and the first which I began) was that called ‘Saint’s\r\nEverlasting Rest.’ While I was in health I had not the least thoughts\r\nof writing books, or in serving God in any more public way than that\r\nof preaching; but when I was weakened with much bleeding, and left\r\nsolitary in my chamber at Sir John Coke’s in Derbyshire, without any\r\nacquaintance but my servant about me, and was sentenced to death by\r\nmy physicians, I began to contemplate more seriously the _Everlasting\r\nRest_ which I apprehended myself just on the borders of; and that my\r\nthoughts might not be scattered too much in my meditation, I began\r\nto write something upon that subject, intending but a sermon or\r\ntwo (which is the cause that the beginning is in brevity and style\r\ndisproportionable to the rest); but being continued long in sickness,\r\nwhere I had no poor or better employment, I followed it on till it was\r\nenlarged to the bulk in which it is now published.” The hall was at one\r\ntime, about 1811, occupied by Sir Sidney Smith, the “Hero of Acre,”\r\nand also by Sir William Rumbold: it was likewise for many years in the\r\noccupation of Colonel Gooch, one of the heroes of Waterloo—in fact,\r\none of the seven brave men immortalised in history as having defended\r\nthe important and critical post of Houguemont in that great battle. It\r\nis now occupied by William Dashwood Fane, Esq.\r\n\r\nClosely adjoining the hall is Melbourne Church, which is, without\r\ndoubt, one of the very finest and most perfect Norman structures\r\nremaining to us, reminding one forcibly, in its massive piers and other\r\nfeatures, of Durham Cathedral. Indeed, it is far more of a cathedral\r\nin appearance than a parish church. The western doorway is one of its\r\nmost striking external features; but internally it is full of interest\r\nin every part. It is a cruciform structure, with massive central tower,\r\nand two other lantern towers at its west end. The nave is divided\r\nfrom the side-aisles by a series of massive round piers supporting\r\nsemicircular arches, above which is a fine open triforium running\r\nentirely round the nave. Remains of a circular apse are to be traced at\r\nthe east end. Its monuments, too, are worthy of careful examination;\r\nthey are mainly to the family of Hardinge, of King’s Newton, the head\r\nof which family is the present Lord Hardinge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _West Doorway, Melbourne Church._]\r\n\r\nOne mile from Melbourne is the pleasant village of King’s Newton,\r\nwith its Holy Well and its Hall, now in ruins, but long the\r\npaternal residence of the Hardinge family, and from which its then\r\nrepresentative, Viscount Hardinge, of King’s Newton—the heroic\r\nGovernor-General of India—took his title. This distinguished family\r\nhad been settled at this place for several centuries, the hall being\r\nbuilt by them _circa_ 1400. Sir Robert Hardinge, who was Master of the\r\nCourt of Chancery and Attorney-General to Charles II., resided here,\r\nand was visited by that monarch, who remained his guest for some days.\r\nOn the glass of the window of his room King Charles scratched the\r\nanagram, _Cras ero lux_, being a clever transposition of the words,\r\n_Carolus rex_, and meaning “To-morrow I shall shine.” In the garden is\r\na famous old mulberry-tree, under which it is said the monarch used\r\nto sit: it is still luxuriant in foliage and in fruit. The hall was\r\ndestroyed by fire only a few years ago, and its picturesque ruins and\r\ngrounds are now open to the public, who during the summer months “there\r\ndo congregate” for pic-nic parties and rural enjoyments. Our engraving\r\nshows the hall as it appeared before the fire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _King’s Newton Hall as it was._]\r\n\r\nThe village of King’s Newton, one of the most delightful of villages,\r\nhas a literary celebrity attaching to it. Here Thomas Hall, who wrote\r\n“Wisdom’s Conquest” in 1640, resided; and here, too, Speechly, the\r\nRural Economist; Mundy, who wrote “The Fall of Needwood” and “Needwood\r\nForest;” Mrs. Green, the authoress of “John Gray of Willoughby;”\r\nthe Ortons, one of whom is known by his “Excelsior” and his “Three\r\nPalaces,” and the other by his varied writings, were residents, as\r\nwas also the author of “Thurstan Meverell;” and here, in his native\r\nplace, resided till his death, in February, 1876, the able historian of\r\nMelbourne, Mr. John Joseph Briggs, who also ranked high as a writer\r\non natural history. The locality has other attractions “too numerous\r\nto mention.” Independently of its great natural beauties, its most\r\nattractive associations are undoubtedly with a grand and honourable\r\npast. Of King’s Newton Mr. Briggs thus wrote:—\r\n\r\n  “Sweet Newton, first to thee my song I raise.\r\n  Thy charms, loved hamlet, need no poet’s praise;\r\n  O’er thy green meads first trips the laughing Spring,\r\n  And shakes primroses from each flower-wreathed wing:\r\n  There the first swallow skims the daisied vale,\r\n  And the loved cuckoo breathes her mellow tale,\r\n  And merry chiff-chaff from the budding tree\r\n  Gives out his joyous notes so wild and free.\r\n  And when old Autumn sheds o’er field and bower\r\n  The radiant hues of many a gorgeous flower,\r\n  And bids the sun lead down his stately dance,\r\n  Thy fields are last to catch his parting glance.\r\n  Within thy bounds I drew mine earliest breath,\r\n  And there, grant Heaven, these eyes may close in death!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Holy Well, King’s Newton._]\r\n\r\nBesides its ruined hall, there is at King’s Newton a Holy Well, the\r\nstructure over which was erected by Robert Hardinge in 1660, and\r\nrestored a few years back by one of his descendants. It bears on\r\nits front the inscription—“FONS SACER HIC STRVITVR ROBERTO NOMINIS\r\nHARDINGE, 1660.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Trent and Weston Cliff._]\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of Melbourne, too, are many pleasant places and\r\ndelightful “bits” of scenery. Weston Cliff,\r\n\r\n  “Just rising from fair fields clad now in green,\r\n  Its beauteous church-spire tap’ring o’er the wood,”\r\n\r\non the banks of “silver Trent,” is one of the most favourite and famous\r\nfishing resorts of the district, and its manifold attractions have\r\noften been the theme of the local poet’s song:—\r\n\r\n  “Sweet Weston Cliff! how beautiful art thou!\r\n  How dark the firs that crown thy rugged brow!\r\n  Adown thy sides the straggling white sloe falls,\r\n  And blossom’d thorns outspread their snowy palls,\r\n  And the glad furze hath beauteously unrolled\r\n  For the Spring’s feet her gorgeous cloth of gold.”\r\n\r\nDonington Cliff, too, on the river margin of the broad lands of\r\nDonington, the seat of the late Marquis of Hastings and of Mr.\r\nHastings, father of the present Earl of Loudoun, is a charming spot,\r\nespecially where, as shown in our engraving,\r\n\r\n  “Proud trees bend, and on Trent’s waves descry\r\n  Their own bright image as it passes by,”\r\n\r\njust where the boat-house and landing-place are situated. But we have\r\nno space wherein to describe the beauties of the neighbourhood, and\r\nmust leave Melbourne to pass on to our next chapter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Trent and Donington Cliff._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMERLEYTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMERLEYTON, the Sumerledetun of Domesday survey, and occasionally in\r\nlater times written Somerley, lies about six miles from Lowestoft, in\r\nthe county of Suffolk, its nearest point on the coast being some four\r\nmiles distant. At the time of the Conquest, Wihtred, a free man and a\r\npriest, held forty acres for a manor, and Ulf, a free man under the\r\nprotection of Earl Gurth, held two carucates of land for a manor. The\r\nwhole place was seized by the Conqueror, and given to Roger Bigod as\r\nsteward. It was soon after held as one manor by Sir Peter Fitz-Osbert,\r\nwhose son, Sir Roger Fitz-Osbert, was lord of the place, _temp._ Henry\r\nIII., and was, 22nd Edward I. summoned to Parliament as Baron Osborne:\r\nhe died in 1305-6. His sister, Isabel Fitz-Osbert, wife of Sir Walter\r\nJernegan, or Jerningham, of Horham Jernegan, in Suffolk, and widow of\r\nSir Henry de Walpole, became heiress to the Somerleyton estates on the\r\ndeath of her brother, and thus they passed into the Jernegan family.\r\n\r\nThe Jernegans, even at that time, boasted an ancient pedigree. The\r\nearliest of whom there is any record was living in 1182, and left\r\nby his wife Sibilla a son, Hubert, who, in 1203, married Margery,\r\ndaughter and heiress of De Harling, of East Harling, and by her had\r\nissue, besides others, a son, Sir Hugh Jernegan, who married Ellen,\r\ndaughter and heiress of Sir Thomas Englethorpe. Their son it was\r\nwho married Isabel Fitz-Osbert, and thus acquired the manor of\r\nSomerleyton in her right. Their son, Sir Peter Jernegan, Knt., married\r\nthree wives: first, Alice, daughter of Sir Hugh Germayne; secondly,\r\nMatilda, daughter of Sir Roger Herling; and thirdly, Ellen, daughter\r\nof Sir Roger de Huntingfield. By his first wife he had issue Sir John\r\nJernegan, Knt., of Somerleyton, whose wife was Agatha, daughter of Sir\r\nRobert Shelton, of Shelton, Knt. Their son, Sir John Jernegan, who\r\ndied in 1375, married Joan, daughter and co-heiress of Sir William de\r\nKelveden and widow of Sir John Lowdham, by whom he had issue his son\r\nand successor, Sir John Jernegan, who, by his wife Margaret, daughter\r\nof Sir Thomas Vise de Lou, Knt., of Shotley, had, besides other issue,\r\na son, Sir Thomas Jernegan, Knt., who succeeded him, and who married\r\nJoan Appleyard, of Dunston, by whom he left a son, John Jernegan,\r\nwho succeeded him. This gentleman married twice: by his first wife,\r\nJane, daughter of Sir John Darell, of Calehill, he had a son and\r\nheir, John Jernegan, who married Isabel, daughter and heiress of Sir\r\nGervase Clifton, Knt. The issue of this marriage was a son, Sir Edward\r\nJernegan, who was knighted, and succeeded his father in the estates.\r\n\r\nThis Sir Edward Jernegan was married twice: first, to Margaret,\r\ndaughter of Sir Edmund Bedingfield, Knt.; and, secondly, to Mary,\r\ndaughter and co-heiress of Richard Scroope, son of Lord Scroope. By\r\nthis second marriage he had, among other issue, a son, Sir Henry\r\nJerningham, of Wingfield and Huntingfield Hall, in Suffolk, and of\r\nConey, in Norfolk, Vice-Chamberlain and Master of the Horse to Queen\r\nMary, from whom are descended the present Jerninghams of Staffordshire\r\nand other counties. By his first wife Sir Edward had issue six\r\nsons—Sir John, Sir Robert, Thomas, Olyf, Nicholas, and Edward—and two\r\ndaughters: Ann, who became the wife of five husbands, and Margaret, who\r\nwas twice married. He died in 1515, and was succeeded by his eldest\r\nson, Sir John Jernegan, of Somerleyton, who married Bridget, daughter\r\nof Sir Robert Drury, Knt., of Halsted, by whom, with other issue, he\r\nhad a son, George Jernegan, who succeeded him, and who, having espoused\r\nElye, daughter of Sir John Spelman, of Narborough, Knt., was succeeded\r\nby his son, John Jernegan. This gentleman married Catherine, daughter\r\nof George Brooke, Lord Cobham, and had by her issue four daughters,\r\nhis co-heiresses—viz. Elizabeth; Katherine, married to Wymond Carew;\r\nFrances, married, first, to Thomas Bedingfield, and, secondly, to her\r\nrelative Henry Jerningham, of Coney Park; and Margaret, married to ——\r\nFord, of Butley. Frances, the third daughter, inherited Somerleyton,\r\nand conveyed it to her second husband, Henry Jerningham, who sold it to\r\nJohn Wentworth, Esq.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The South Lodge._]\r\n\r\nIt will thus have been seen that the Jernegans (whose arms\r\nwere—_argent_, three buckles, _gules_) held Somerleyton for no fewer\r\nthan thirteen generations. In addition to this, they became possessed\r\nof the greater part of the King’s manor of the Island of Lothingland—a\r\ndistrict occupying the north-east corner of the county of Suffolk, and\r\ncontaining the sixteen parishes of Somerleyton, Lowestoft, Corton,\r\nGunton, Oulton, Ashby, Lound, Fritton, Flixton, Hopton, Blundeston,\r\nGorleston, Belton, Burgh, Bradwell, and Herringfleet. In 1619 Henry\r\nJerningham died at Cossey, nine years after having sold Somerleyton to\r\nJohn Wentworth, whose son was Sir John Wentworth, one of the chiefs\r\nof the Cavalier party of the district during the civil wars; and\r\nCromwell and his troopers paid several visits to the old hall, making\r\nfree with its forage, and “carrying away its musquets.” The village of\r\nSomerleyton appears, like its master, to have been staunchly loyal,\r\nand was harassed in consequence by the quartering of soldiers and the\r\nexaction of forced loans by the partisans of the Commonwealth. Ireton,\r\nin 1648, summoned the bailiffs of Yarmouth to meet him in conference\r\nat Somerleyton Hall, and there delivered to them the Lord General’s\r\nperemptory command, either to “ingarrison their town, or to demolish\r\ntheir walls and fortifications.” A rousing bonfire and bountiful\r\ndistribution of bread and beer celebrated the restoration of King\r\nCharles II.\r\n\r\nSir John Wentworth records that “on the 14th day of March, 1642,\r\nCollonell Cromwell’s troope, and Captain Fountayne with his troope,\r\nand divers others, to the number of 140, came to Somerley Hall;” the\r\nday after they “tooke away muskets, bandeliers, rests, head-pieces,\r\nand one fowling-piece,” and other things of which no note was made.\r\nThe Protector was, therefore, certainly an inmate of Somerleyton, and\r\nprobably more than once. Matters changed, however: in 1660 an order\r\nwas issued to the constables of Somerleyton and Ashby “to re-provide\r\nprayer books for their churches;” also to warn “all alehouse-keepers\r\nand butchers to enter recognisance for the observation of Lent and\r\nfish dayes.” The stout old knight did not live to see the King “enjoy\r\nhis own again;” but his loyal widow did, and subscribed ten shillings\r\n“towards the building of a bone fire” upon St. George’s Day, 1661.\r\n\r\nSir John Wentworth married Anne Soame, but died without issue in 1651.\r\nFrom the Wentworths, Somerleyton passed to John Garneys, the son of\r\nElizabeth Wentworth, sister of Sir Thomas Wentworth, who had become\r\nthe wife of Charles Garneys, a member of the fine old Suffolk family\r\nwho bore the alliterative motto of “God’s Grace Guides Garneys.” The\r\nGarneys (whose arms were—_argent_, a chevron engrailed, _azure_,\r\nbetween three escallop shells, _sable_) were originally seated at\r\nBoyland Hall, Morningthorpe, Norfolk, and at Heveringham and Kenton,\r\nin Suffolk. In 1672 the then representative of the family, Thomas\r\nGarneys, sold the estate to Admiral Sir Thomas Allin, Bart., a Suffolk\r\nworthy whose name figures prominently in history. Thomas Garneys then\r\nremoved from Somerleyton to Boyland Hall, where he had a son, Wentworth\r\nGarneys, who married Mary, daughter of Sir Thomas Abdy. Sir Thomas\r\nAllin was born in 1613, and was captain of one of the ships in the\r\nservice of the Commonwealth which went over to the Prince of Wales.\r\nIn 1663 he was constituted commander-in-chief in the Downs, and later\r\non of the Mediterranean. In 1665 he struck the first blow of war with\r\nthe Dutch by attacking their Smyrna fleet of forty ships with eight\r\nsail of the line, when, after making prizes of four ships, he drove\r\nthe remaining thirty-six into Cadiz harbour. In the same year, in the\r\ngreat sea-fight off Lowestoft, when the English fleet, under the Duke\r\nof York, Prince Rupert, and others, engaged the Dutch fleet under Van\r\nTromp, Admiral Allin held a command.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Front._]\r\n\r\nIn the following year Allin was at the head of the White Squadron\r\nwhen the fleet fell upon the Dutch van, routing it and killing the\r\nthree Dutch admirals who commanded that division. In the same year\r\nAllin attacked the French fleet, boarding and capturing the _Ruby_ of\r\nfifty-four guns. Three years later “he sailed with a strong squadron\r\nto chastise the Algerines,” which he accomplished, and returned home\r\nworn out in the heavy services of his country. In consideration of\r\nthese many services Admiral Allin was created a baronet in 1673, and\r\nretired to Somerleyton, which, as has been stated, he had recently\r\npurchased. A portrait of the brave old admiral, who was called “the\r\nScourge of Yarmouth,” is now at Somerleyton. That town took the side\r\nof the Parliament in the civil war, while Lowestoft was profoundly\r\nloyal. Sir Thomas married, first, Alice, daughter of Captain Whiting,\r\nof Lowestoft, by whom he had issue one son—Thomas Allin, his\r\nsuccessor—and two daughters: Anne, who died unmarried, and Alice,\r\nmarried to Edmund Anguish, Esq., of Moulton, in the county of Norfolk,\r\nwhose son inherited the estates and title; and, secondly, Elizabeth,\r\ndaughter of Thomas Anguish, Esq., and sister of his son-in-law, by whom\r\nhe had no issue. Sir Thomas died in 1686 or 1688, and was buried at\r\nSomerleyton. He was succeeded by his son, Sir Thomas Allin, who married\r\nMary, daughter of John Caldwall, of London; but, dying without issue\r\nin 1696, the baronetcy became extinct, and the estates devolved upon\r\nhis nephew, Richard Anguish, Esq., son of Alice Allin and her husband,\r\nEdmund Anguish, Esq. The arms of Allin were—_gules_, three swords\r\nbarwise, points to the sinister side, _argent_, hilts and pomels,\r\n_or_, between four mullets of the third. Crest—a sword in pale, point\r\nupwards.\r\n\r\nThis Alice Allin had issue by her husband, Edmund Anguish, three\r\nsons—Richard, Edmund, and Allin—the eldest of whom, Richard,\r\ninherited Somerleyton, and having, in accordance with the will of his\r\nuncle, assumed the arms and surname of Allin, was created a baronet in\r\n1699: the descendants of Edmund, the second son, afterwards inherited\r\nthe estates. Sir Richard Allin (formerly Anguish) married Frances,\r\nonly daughter of Sir Henry Ashurst, Bart., of Waterstock, by whom he\r\nhad issue four sons—Thomas Allin, Henry Allin, Richard Allin, and\r\nthe Rev. Ashurst Allin—and one daughter, Diana, married to Thomas\r\nHenry Ashurst, Esq., of Waterstock. Sir Richard died in 1725, and was\r\nsucceeded in his title and estates by his eldest son, Sir Thomas Allin,\r\nBart., who, dying unmarried in 1764, was succeeded by his brother,\r\nthe Rev. Sir Ashurst Allin, Bart., Rector of Blundeston-cum-Flixton,\r\nwho married Thomasin Norris, and, dying in 1770, was succeeded by his\r\nonly son, Sir Thomas Allin, Bart. This gentleman died unmarried in\r\n1794, when the baronetcy again became extinct, the Somerleyton estates\r\npassing to his distant kinsman, Thomas Anguish, Esq., as will now be\r\nshown.\r\n\r\nEdmund Anguish, second son of Alice Allin, and her husband, Edmund\r\nAnguish, married Mary Betts, by whom he had issue two sons—the\r\nRev. Thomas and Edmund—and two daughters, Mary and Dorothy. The\r\nRev. Thomas Anguish, who was of Halesworth, married Mary Eling,\r\nof Beccles, and, dying in 1763, was succeeded by his son, Thomas\r\nAnguish, Accountant-General to the Court of Chancery; who, marrying\r\nSarah Henley, of Docking, had issue by her three sons—Thomas, the\r\nRev. George, and Charles—and three daughters, Catherine, Anne, and\r\nCharlotte. The eldest of the sons, Thomas Anguish, it was who inherited\r\nthe estates of Somerleyton on the death of his kinsman, Sir Thomas\r\nAllin, Bart., when the title became extinct. This Thomas Anguish died\r\nunmarried in 1810, and was succeeded by his brother, the Rev. George\r\nAnguish, from whom, in 1843 (when the line became extinct), the estates\r\npassed to the son of his sister, Catherine Anguish, who, in 1788, had\r\nmarried Francis Godolphin-Osborne, fifth Duke of Leeds, she being his\r\nsecond wife. By this union she had issue Lord Sidney Godolphin-Osborne\r\nand Lady Anne Sarah Godolphin, married to John Whyte-Melville, Esq.\r\nTheir son, Captain Whyte-Melville, is the distinguished author of many\r\nworks of fiction. The arms of Anguish were—_gules_, a cinquefoil,\r\npierced, _or_; the crest—a snake coiled, encircled with grass; and the\r\nmotto—“Latet anguis in herbâ.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The West Front._]\r\n\r\nThe Somerleyton estate, having come by descent to Lord Sidney\r\nGodolphin-Osborne, was sold by him, in 1844, to Samuel Morton Peto,\r\nEsq., the extensive “contractor,” who had become the purchaser of the\r\nNorwich and Lowestoft ship canal, and to whose enterprise Lowestoft\r\nowes its railway, its pier, its harbour, &c. By Samuel Morton Peto the\r\nold mansion was entirely rearranged, extended, and altered; and by him\r\nalso was the church, in a measure, rebuilt, and the village entirely\r\nremodelled, at a large outlay.\r\n\r\nWe should neglect an essential part of our duty if we omitted to do\r\ntender homage to that most enterprising and liberal gentleman. He\r\n“created” Somerleyton, so to speak, made it the grand and beautiful\r\nedifice it now is, formed its grounds, constructed and ornamented its\r\ndelicious winter garden, hung the rooms with pictures, and filled\r\nthe library with useful and pleasant books. Unhappily, circumstances\r\nprevented his enjoying them. Fortune, ever capricious, consigned it\r\nto other hands; the rich contractor had to sustain a reverse, and\r\nthe “earthly paradise” passed from his hands into those of another.\r\nHappily, however, that other was the well-known late Sir Francis\r\nCrossley, who became the owner of the property, by purchase, in 1862.\r\n\r\nSir Francis Crossley had no pedigree to trace; his father was a\r\nself-made man, and he a self-made millionaire. His father was a\r\njourneyman carpet-weaver; his mother, herself a farmer’s daughter, was\r\na farm servant. The mother lived to a ripe old age; the father to start\r\nthe now famous firm of Crossley and Sons, and see it in a fair way to\r\nsuccess. The humble origin of Sir Francis Crossley was a matter which\r\nhe loved unostentatiously to trace. “Many years after the marriage,”\r\nhe related on one occasion, “my father and mother took Dean Clough\r\nMills. As my mother went with her usual energy to that place, down the\r\nyard at four o’clock in the morning, she made a vow—‘If the Lord does\r\nbless us at this place, the poor shall taste of it.’ It is to this\r\nvow, given with so much faithfulness, and kept with so much fidelity,\r\nthat I attribute the great success my father had in business.” Sir\r\nFrancis Crossley’s benefactions were large. To the town of Halifax,\r\nin 1857, he gave the People’s Park, at a cost of about £40,000. About\r\n1861 there was commenced the erection of the Crossley Orphan Home\r\nand School on Skircoat Moor, which was built and endowed by Messrs.\r\nJohn, Francis, and Joseph Crossley, at a cost of £65,000. The building\r\nhas accommodation for four hundred children. It was provided by the\r\nMessrs. Crossley with an endowment of £3,000 a year, but this sum has\r\nbeen increased from other sources. In 1871 he gave £10,000 to the\r\nCorporation of Halifax as a loan fund for the benefit of deserving\r\ninhabitants. Out of this fund men may borrow to the extent of £300, and\r\nwomen to the extent of £100, at 2½ per cent., on certain conditions,\r\none being that £10 of the principal shall be paid back annually. Then\r\nhe gave £10,000 to the Congregational Pastors’ Retiring Fund; £10,000\r\nto a fund for the relief of widows of Congregational pastors; and\r\n£20,000 to the London Missionary Society—making a total within a short\r\ntime of £60,000. He was a member of the Independent body, but he was a\r\nliberal contributor to every good cause. Sir Francis was born in 1817,\r\nand from 1852 to 1859 sat as M.P. for Halifax; from 1859 to 1865 for\r\nthe West Riding of Yorkshire; from 1865 to 1868 for the North-west\r\nRiding; and from the latter year until 1872 for the north division of\r\nthe West Riding of the same county; having thus sat in Parliament for\r\nan unbroken period of twenty years. He married, in 1845, Martha Eliza,\r\ndaughter of the late Henry Brinton, Esq., of Kidderminster, by whom\r\nhe left issue an only surviving child, the present Sir Savile Brinton\r\nCrossley. Sir Francis was created a baronet in 1863.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _North-east View._]\r\n\r\nThe present baronet, and owner of the immense estates and wealth of Sir\r\nFrancis, is his son, Sir Savile Brinton Crossley, who was born in 1857,\r\nand succeeded to the title in 1872.\r\n\r\nThe arms of Crossley are—_gules_, a chevron indented, _ermine_,\r\nbetween two cross-crosslets in chief, and a saltire couped in base,\r\n_or_. Crest—a demi-hind erased, _proper_, charged with two bars, _or_,\r\nand holding between the feet a cross-crosslet, _or_. Motto—“Omne bonum\r\nab alto.” The family seats are Somerleyton, near Lowestoft, in Suffolk,\r\nand Belle Vue, Halifax, Yorkshire.\r\n\r\nThe old hall of Somerleyton was one of the finest of the old brick\r\nmansions remaining, and possessed many interesting features. Fuller,\r\nthe quaint old writer whose words are so often quoted, ranked it among\r\nthe best of the many fine houses of the county of Suffolk, and says\r\nthat it well deserved the name of Somerleyton, for here summer is to be\r\nseen in the depth of winter—the grounds being planted with evergreens,\r\nand the pleasant walks beset on both sides with fir-trees, green all\r\nthe year round, besides other curiosities.\r\n\r\nThe Park, about two hundred acres in extent, is rich in beauty, and\r\nincludes a deer park. Two miles from the house, in the direction of\r\nYarmouth, there is a drive through ornamental grounds, and a “decoy”\r\non a splendid sheet of water three miles long, and a quarter of a mile\r\nin breadth, called Fritton Lake. It abounds with a variety of fish,\r\nand is the resort of widgeons, ducks, teal, grebes, and other wild\r\nfowl during the season, which begins in October and ends in April.\r\nVast quantities are taken yearly. The banks of this fine sheet of\r\nwater are fringed with wood, and two or three gentlemen’s houses and\r\npleasure-grounds add interest to the scenery. The lake separates the\r\nparishes of Fritton, Herringfleet, Belton, Lound, and Ashby; and in the\r\nHerringfleet woods, belonging to Major Leathes, there is a heronry. The\r\nowner of Somerleyton, to whom belongs a large portion of the lake, has\r\na beautiful drive on one side of it, extending for nearly two miles,\r\nwinding through plantations comprising choice specimens of pines,\r\n&c., with occasional peeps of the lake on one side, and heath and\r\nwoods on the other. The lake—such is its natural and yet cultivated\r\nbeauty—might be a bit of the lovely shire of Devon planted among the\r\nbare plains of Suffolk. It is zig-zag in form; tiny peninsulas jut\r\ninto it, clothed with graceful firs and thick underwood, among which\r\ntall ferns luxuriate; the steeps have gradual ascents from the banks;\r\nclosely planted trees of many varieties completely cover them; and it\r\nis only now and then that glimpses are caught of the water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _In the Winter Garden. Spanish Dancers, Hautmann._]\r\n\r\nThe lake is close and compact, and on no side does there seem any\r\nopening, only footpaths lead to it from the adjacent roads. Its\r\nsolitary character—out of the way of passing intruders—and its\r\nthickness of composition, render it a favourite shelter of wild fowl.\r\nThey do not, however, enjoy solitude in security. Man is always astir\r\nin search of prey: three “decoys” are active at all seasons to entrap\r\nthe unsuspicious and unwary. One of them was in operation during our\r\nvisit. Domestic ducks were sailing in and out of a narrow passage,\r\nquacking and playing and feeding, to show their wild cousins outside\r\nthat no danger was near. Two or three bolder than the rest summoned\r\ncourage to enter, and very soon were in the net-trap that furnished the\r\nbag of the gamekeeper.\r\n\r\nThis charming scene of mingled wood and water adds materially to the\r\nattractions of the locality; and here Art has been brought to the aid\r\nof Nature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _In the Winter Garden. Statue, Hautmann._]\r\n\r\nPassing in at the North Lodge, visitors are generally conducted\r\nthrough the kitchen and fruit gardens, the vineries, hothouses, and\r\nconservatories, to a sloping lawn facing the Winter Garden and north\r\nfront of the house, from which point a charming scene presents itself.\r\n“Before us,” says a recent writer, “in a setting of old forest trees,\r\ncedars, aged thorns, clumps of azaleas, and rhododendrons, rises, as\r\nif evoked by a magician’s wand, a range of fantastic palaces of glass,\r\ntheir many sheeny domes and pinnacles sparkling like diamond facets in\r\nthe noonday sun, and their contours and traceried outlines of graceful\r\narabesques backed and thrown into relief by the deep red brick-work of\r\nthe towers, gables, and campaniles of the hall.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _In the Winter Garden. Statue of Hymen, Byrtrom._]\r\n\r\nOn the left is an aviary of gold and silver pheasants, screening a part\r\nof the offices. The area covered by the Winter Garden is one hundred\r\nfeet square. Within the decorations are Renaissance, of a light and\r\nelegant character. Four main alleys converge under the great mosque\r\ndome, beneath which is a fountain supported on a rockery of ferns by\r\nfour dolphins, and surmounted by a marble statue of the “Nymph of the\r\nLily.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _In the Winter Garden. Nymph at her Toilet, Haudmauer._]\r\n\r\nFrom the central alley numerous aisles diverge to an outer one,\r\ncircumscribing the building. The roof is supported by light iron\r\ncolumns covered with fuchsias and beautiful creepers, with wire baskets\r\nof flowers suspended overhead. Parterres of rare exotics, and large\r\nmajolica vases filled with flowers, occupy the grand space. At the\r\ncorners and in other parts are life-sized statues: mirrors and other\r\nappliances add to the beauty of the whole. The south side opens to the\r\nBilliard, Morning, and Withdrawing Rooms. Aviaries of singing-birds are\r\nplaced at intervals throughout the garden, and in the corridor leading\r\nto the Palm-house are a fern-grotto and fountain. The whole, it should\r\nbe specially noted, may be lit with gas.\r\n\r\nFrom the Winter Garden the visitor is shown the Italian Garden,\r\nopposite the west front. This front of the house opens upon a noble\r\nterrace, three hundred feet in length, enriched with statuary, vases,\r\n&c., from which three flights of steps lead down to the Dutch Garden,\r\nlaid out in geometrical form by Nesfield, in the same general manner\r\nas that by him at Castle Howard, which we have heretofore described.\r\nIn the centre of this parterre is a noble sundial, and from this\r\npoint, looking to the south, a view is obtained of the grand avenue\r\nof fine old lime-trees, four hundred and fifty yards in length, at\r\nthe termination of which the Church of Somerleyton is seen. Near to\r\nthis avenue, in which are some fine sculptured figures and groups and\r\nother objects, is a double avenue of elm-trees. In this garden will\r\nbe especially noticed two admirably sculptured figures of “Night” and\r\n“Morning,” by the late John Thomas, an artist of eminence and great\r\nability, whose advice is understood to have greatly guided Sir Morton\r\nPeto in the adornment of the beautiful house; he may, indeed, be\r\ndescribed as “the architect.” There is also (but on the other side of\r\nthe Winter Garden) a drinking-fountain, created by a statue, the work\r\nof Joseph Durham, A.R.A., of a milkmaid, her pail at her feet, in an\r\nattitude that implies outlook for the kine.\r\n\r\nThe West Front, one hundred and fifty feet in length, is composed of a\r\ncentral tower and two wings, with large bay windows. The entrance is by\r\na porch in the central tower.\r\n\r\nThe Corridor, lined with wainscot, leads to a finely panelled Hall,\r\nfrom which a staircase ascends to the upper suites of apartments. The\r\nHall is hung with arms and curious and valuable armour, one suit of\r\nwhich, of remarkably fine design and the most exquisite workmanship,\r\nis inlaid with gold, and bears a German motto, and the date 1652. Over\r\nthe massive chimney-piece the wall is decorated by Maclise’s large\r\noil-painting of “Chivalry.” It contains also other valuable works\r\nof Art; among them a fine picture of deer by Sir Edwin Landseer, in\r\nhis best manner and his best time. In the stained-glass windows are\r\nthe arms of some of the successive owners of Somerleyton—Allin,\r\nAnguish, Godolphin-Osborne, Peto, Crossley, &c. On the landing is a\r\nportrait-picture of George and Robert Stephenson, and in the passage\r\nfrom the Staircase to the Boudoir are “Edward the Confessor leaving his\r\nCrown to Harold,” and “Harold’s Oath to William, Duke of Normandy,”\r\npictures of great merit by John Cross. There is also in the Hall a\r\ngrand colossal statue of Æneas. In the outer Hall—placed on a very\r\ngraceful pedestal—is a marble statue of a boy who has been gathering\r\nshells by the seashore; it is a portrait-statue of the present baronet,\r\nand is one of the charming works of Joseph Durham, A.R.A.\r\n\r\nThe Dining-hall, which is two stories in height, has a rich carved\r\npolychrome ceiling in compartments, and cornices of oak, with gilt\r\nreliefs, and clusters of fruit and wreaths of flowers. It has a huge\r\npyramidal chimney-piece, supported by two full-length caryatides,\r\n“Summer” and “Winter,” by John Thomas. The ceiling is carried on\r\nbrackets supported by heads of the roebuck, wild boar, &c. In the\r\nstained-glass windows are medallion-portraits of Newton, Watt, Chaucer,\r\nShakspere, Wren, and Reynolds, surmounted by allegorical figures of the\r\nliberal sciences. On either side the fire-place are _chefs-d’œuvre_\r\nof Stanfield fitted into panels, and above these are frescoes by\r\nMaclise and Horsley. The furniture is massive and appropriate, and a\r\nfine minstrel’s gallery adds much to the beauty of the room. In this\r\ngallery is a fine mechanical orchestral organ. The two paintings by\r\nStanfield are, we believe, the largest in size of his productions,\r\nand undoubtedly his best works. They are so well known as to need no\r\ndescription here: one is the Storming of St. Sebastian, the other\r\nthe dismantled _Victory_ towed into Gibraltar after the battle of\r\nTrafalgar. These are monuments to the memory of one of the greatest\r\npainters of any age. In this most beautiful room also hang a “St.\r\nSimeon,” by Guido, and a large and very fine example of G. Lance: it is\r\ncalled “The Seneschal,” and is certainly the best work of this artist.\r\n\r\nThe Breakfast-room, a charming apartment filled with choice objects,\r\ncommands a view down one of the avenues; in it are the “Italian\r\nPeasants,” by Armitage, landscapes by Constable, a fruit-piece by Hunt,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\nThe Library has a beautiful ceiling, and is fitted with carved\r\nbook-cases, containing editions of all modern authors. In the extensive\r\ncollection few works of merit and interest are omitted. Over the\r\nchimney-piece, with its motto, “Learn to live, live to learn,” is\r\nRembrandt’s grand picture of “Ferdinand and Isabella;” and there are\r\nalso portraits of Milton and Shakspere, the latter a “life” portrait\r\nfrom Stowe.\r\n\r\nThe old Drawing-room is wainscoted throughout, and the cornices,\r\ndoor-heads, and mirror-frame are exquisitely and elaborately carved\r\nwith game, and groups and festoons of fruit and flowers, attributed\r\nto Gibbons. In the upper lights of tho windows, of modern insertion,\r\nlandscapes are introduced.\r\n\r\nThe Drawing-room, Billiard-room, and other apartments are all of equal\r\nelegance, and all filled with costly furniture and choice works of Art,\r\namong which are paintings by Beverley, Lance, Solomon, Mole, and others.\r\n\r\nIn the upper rooms of the house—not, of course, shown to visitors—is\r\npreserved the ancient tapestry which adorned the walls of the old\r\nmansion; and here, too, are many gems of Art, including examples of\r\nWright of Derby, Wilson, Bright, and others; with Manuel’s “Voyage\r\nSubjects,” twenty-two in number. The subjects of the tapestry are\r\nas follows:—In the Tapestry-room, the “Story of Lucretia;” in the\r\nDressing-room, portions of a very large tapestry, “The Passage of the\r\nRed Sea,” “Moses striking the Rock,” &c. The “Story of Lucretia” is in\r\nfive panels, very beautifully wrought, obviously from the designs of an\r\naccomplished artist. There are also pictures of great worth in some of\r\nthese rooms; notably a portrait by Holbein of his mother, a series of\r\ncharming drawings by Henry Bright, and several fine proof engravings\r\nof great pictures. Many of the pieces of furniture were purchased at\r\nStowe, and are of great rarity and worth—brilliant examples of Art of\r\na past but honoured age.\r\n\r\nThe Business-room is a finely groined apartment, hung with rich old\r\ntapestry, and contains, among other works of Art, three pictures by\r\nHerring, one attributed to Rubens, and some good examples of the old\r\nDutch masters.\r\n\r\nThe Stables (flanked by a clock-tower of much elegance) lie to the\r\nright of the main entrance; they are models of architectural beauty,\r\nand are, of course, fitted up with all the modern appliances of comfort\r\nand convenience.\r\n\r\nIn the Church of Somerleyton are preserved the old rood-screen,\r\ncontaining sixteen painted panels of saints, and some of the monuments\r\nfrom the older edifice. Among these are memorials to Admiral Sir\r\nThomas Allin, to Sir John Wentworth and his lady, and to Sir Thomas\r\nJernegan—an altar-tomb, on which, according to Weever and Camden,\r\nthere was formerly the inscription—\r\n\r\n  “Jesu Christ, both God and Man,\r\n  Save thy servant Jernegan.”\r\n\r\nOn the front of the tomb are three, and at each end one, lozenge-formed\r\npanels, in each of which is a quatrefoil with trefoiled cusps. In the\r\ncentre of each is a shield of arms. On the top of the tomb are places\r\nwhere brasses have at one time been fixed. Among the arms are Appleyard\r\nimpaled with Jernegan. This tomb has been much impaired by time. It is\r\nnow, however, carefully preserved.\r\n\r\nAnother slab bears the inscription, “Margaret Jernegan, the wyef of\r\nEdward Jernegan, Esquyer, daughter of Sir Edmund Bedingfelde, Knt.,\r\nwhich Margaret dyed the xxiiij of Marche, anno MDIII.”\r\n\r\nThe monument to Sir John Wentworth and his lady bears figures of the\r\nknight in armour, with the peaked beard of the times, and the lady\r\nhabited in a plain dress; an escutcheon has the arms of Wentworth,\r\n_azure_, a saltire, _ermine_, between four eagles displayed, _or_;\r\nimpaling Soame, _gules_, a chevron between three mullets, _or_,\r\nquartered with, second, _azure_, two bars gemelles and a canton, _or_,\r\ncharged with a tun, and, third, _gules_, six annulets, _or_.\r\n\r\nThe memorial to Sir Thomas Allin is a tablet bearing the following\r\ninscription:—“Near this place lies interred Sir Thomas Allin, Bart.,\r\nwhose unshaken fidelity to his sovereign, Charles ye 2nd, was rewarded\r\nwith many marks of his royal favour, having had the honour of serving\r\nhim as Admiral in his fleets, in the British and Mediterranean Seas;\r\nController of the Navy, Captain of Sandgate Castle, and Master of the\r\nTrinity House. He died in 1686 in ye 73 year of his age.”\r\n\r\nThe Church is seen from many parts of the grounds of Somerleyton\r\nHall—always a pleasant object in the landscape—through a grand avenue\r\nof elms: a wood-walk footpath leads to it from the house. A fine piece\r\nof the park forms a portion of the glebe. The Church is dedicated to\r\nSt. Mary. A singular and interesting octangular font (in some parts\r\nrecut), with an inscription, now illegible, is one of its few remains\r\nof antiquity.\r\n\r\nThere is also a small modern Chapel at a little distance from the\r\nhouse, where service is held on Sundays. It was originally erected\r\nas a Baptist chapel by Sir Morton Peto. Close to it is a Maze of\r\ndwarf yews, kept with exceeding nicety: in the centre is a graceful\r\ntemple, from the seats of which views are obtained of the gardens and\r\nconservatories.\r\n\r\nThe Conservatories are of great extent, divided into “houses” for\r\nall the rarer plants, with vineries, pine-pits, and all the other\r\naccessories of abundance at every season of the year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Somerleyton Church._]\r\n\r\nThe principal entrance to the mansion is through iron gates, the stone\r\npiers, supporting deer _couchant_, sculptured by John Thomas. This view\r\nwe have engraved on page 207: it is at once graceful and commanding.\r\n\r\nSomerleyton is a magnificent house, but it was erected with a view to\r\ncomfort as well as elegance; all the rooms, both above and below, are\r\nso constructed as to suggest the idea of home; the “appliances and\r\nmeans” of wealth have been judiciously exerted to promote the rational\r\nenjoyment of life; ease has not been sacrificed to state; and grandeur\r\nhas been less studied than content. The house is splendid, and yet\r\nhomely; there is none of the burden of magnificence either in the\r\nmansion or the grounds, while ostentation seems as far removed from\r\nthe lofty and munificently furnished apartments as from those which\r\nornament a simple cottage dwelling.\r\n\r\nIts perfect architectural details, its noble conservatories, its\r\ngarden, its avenues—one of elm, another of lime trees, stretching from\r\nthe house across the park—its numerous vases and statues, happily\r\nplaced—and especially its Winter Garden—all perfect when viewed\r\nseparately, and all joined in admirable harmony—render Somerleyton\r\nremarkable among the most beautiful modern mansions of the kingdom,\r\nand do honour to the sculptor-architect under whose superintendence it\r\nwas planned and executed. Somerleyton, therefore, may be described as\r\none of the gems of the county of Suffolk—a county rich in baronial\r\nmansions, abundant of historic events, and full of traditions of the\r\nearliest, as well as of mediæval, ages in England.\r\n\r\nIt would be a long list that which gave even the names of the baronial\r\nhalls in this grand historic county, and it would far exceed our space\r\nto give details of its ancient monuments—Roman, Saxon, Danish, and\r\nNorman—to say nothing of those that have descended to us from the\r\nstill earlier Britons, many relics of whom are yet to be found in the\r\nneighbourhood. Suffolk is, indeed, if less graced by natural beauties\r\nthan some other of our English shires, rich among the richest of them\r\nin antiquities and in traditions, while it has a high and prominent\r\nplace in British history.\r\n\r\nThe scenery that neighbours Somerleyton is purely English; the lanes\r\nare pleasant and picturesque in spring and summer; the land is\r\nproductive; the broad river Waveney fertilises miles upon miles of\r\ngreen or arable banks between which it runs; the trees have prodigious\r\ngrowth; and, above all, the sea is near at hand; the German Ocean rolls\r\nits waves into the harbours of these eastern shores, bearing the wealth\r\nthat thousands of hardy fishermen gather in during every month of the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nFrom any of the heights, which, though not numerous, occur\r\noccasionally, and, in a degree, from any of the roads that skirt the\r\nshore, may be seen a “multitudinous shipping,” so to say, from the\r\nhuge three-master and the grand steamship to the comparatively small\r\nfishing-smacks that dot the sea-scape, and the heavily weighted coal\r\nvessels that are bearing sources of wealth to all parts of the world.\r\nIt is to the fishing-smacks the locality is mainly indebted for its\r\nprosperity; but Lowestoft now holds rank among the fashionable and most\r\nfrequented sea watering-places of the kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILTON HOUSE.\r\n\r\nWE do not refer to the earlier families who held the title of Earls,\r\n&c., of Pembroke—those of Montgomery, of Clare, of Marshall, of De\r\nValence, and of Hastings—as they, although the predecessors of the\r\nHerberts in the title, were not so in regard to the estates. It has\r\nbeen well said by Sir Bernard Burke that “the name of Pembroke, like\r\nthe scutcheons and monuments in some time-honoured cathedral, cannot\r\nfail to awaken a thousand glorious recollections in the bosoms of all\r\nwho are but tolerably read in English chronicles. Sound it, and no\r\ntrumpet of ancient or modern chivalry would peal a higher war-note. It\r\nis almost superfluous to repeat that this is the family of which it has\r\nbeen so finely said, that ‘all the men were brave, and all the women\r\nchaste;’ and what nobler record was ever engraved upon the tomb of\r\ndeparted greatness?”\r\n\r\nWe commence our notes with William ap Thomas, whose ancestors traced\r\nback to Henry Fitz-Herbert, chamberlain to King Henry I. This Sir\r\nWilliam ap Thomas (who was the son of Thomas ap Gwillim ap Jenkin, by\r\nhis wife Maud, daughter and heiress of Sir John Morley, Knight, Lord\r\nof Raglan Castle) married Gladys, daughter of Sir Richard Gam, and\r\nwidow of Sir Roger Vaughan, by whom he had three sons and a daughter.\r\nThe eldest of these sons was “created Lord of Raglan, Chepstow, and\r\nGower, and commanded to assume the surname of Herbert, in honour of\r\nhis ancestor,” the chamberlain to King Henry I., and afterwards Earl\r\nof Pembroke. “He was succeeded by his son, who renounced the earldom\r\nof Pembroke for that of Huntingdon, at the request of King Edward\r\nIV., that monarch being anxious to dignify his son, Prince Edward,\r\nwith the title of Earl of Pembroke.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Principal Front._]\r\n\r\nThe honour, however, reverted to the Herberts in the reign of Edward\r\nVI., who conferred it upon Sir William Herbert.” This William Herbert,\r\nwho had married Anne, sister of Queen Catherine Parr, was knighted\r\nby Henry VIII., and was appointed executor, or “conservator,” of the\r\nKing’s will; and shared with Sir Anthony Denny the honour of riding\r\nto Windsor in the chariot with the royal corpse, when Henry’s ashes\r\nwere committed to their final resting-place. By Edward VI. Sir William\r\nwas elevated to the peerage by the titles of Baron Herbert of Cardiff\r\nand Earl of Pembroke. In 1551 his wife, the Countess of Pembroke,\r\n“died at Baynard’s Castle, and was carried into St. Paul’s in this\r\norder: first, there went an hundred poor men and women in mantle-freez\r\ngowns; next followed the heralds, and then the corse, about which were\r\neight bannerels of armes, then came the mourners, lordes, knights,\r\nand gentlemen; after them the ladies and gentlewomen mourners, to the\r\nnumber of 200 in all; next came in coats 200 of her own and other\r\nservants. She was interred by the tomb of the Duke of Lancaster; and\r\nafter, her banners were set up over her, and her armes set on divers\r\npillars.” The Earl died March 17th, 1569-70, and was succeeded by\r\nhis son Henry as Earl of Pembroke. This nobleman was thrice married;\r\nfirst, to Catherine, daughter of Henry Grey, Duke of Suffolk, from\r\nwhom he was afterwards divorced; secondly, to Catherine, daughter of\r\nGeorge, Earl of Shrewsbury; and, thirdly, to Mary Sidney, daughter to\r\nSir Henry Sidney, Knight of the Garter, by his wife, the Lady Mary,\r\ndaughter of John, Duke of Northumberland. This lady, the third wife of\r\nthe Earl of Pembroke, was sister to one of the greatest of all great\r\nEnglishmen—Sir Philip Sidney; and it was for her special delight that\r\nhe, while visiting her at Wilton, wrote his inimitable “Arcadia.” By\r\nthis lady the Earl of Pembroke had two sons, William and Philip, both\r\nof whom in turn succeeded to the earldom. The Countess, “Sidney’s\r\nsister, Pembroke’s mother,” “a principal ornament to the family of the\r\nSidneys,” and of whom Spenser wrote that she was\r\n\r\n  “The gentlest shepherdess that liv’d that day,\r\n  And most resembling, both in shape and spirit,\r\n  Her brother dear,”\r\n\r\nsurvived her husband some time, and at her death, which took place in\r\n1621, that beautiful epitaph so often quoted, and as often erroneously\r\nascribed to Ben Jonson, was penned by William Browne, and will bear\r\nagain quoting here:—\r\n\r\n  “Underneath this sable hearse\r\n  Lies the subject of all verse;\r\n  _Sidney’s_ sister! _Pembroke’s_ mother!\r\n  Death, ere thou hast slain another\r\n  Fair, and learn’d, and good as she,\r\n  Time shall throw a dart at thee!\r\n  Marble piles let no man raise\r\n  To her name for after days;\r\n  Some kind woman, born as she,\r\n  Reading this, like Niobe\r\n  Shall turn marble, and become\r\n  Both her mourner and her tomb.”\r\n\r\nWilliam, third Earl of Pembroke under the new creation, eldest son of\r\nthe Earl and of “Sidney’s sister,” succeeded to the title and estates\r\non the death of his father in 1600-1. Of him Aubrey says, “He was of\r\na most noble person, and the glory of the court in the reigne of King\r\nJames and King Charles. He was handsome and of an admirable presence.\r\n\r\n  ‘Gratior et pulchro veniens a corpore virtus.’\r\n\r\nHe was the greatest Mecænas to learned men of any peer of his time—or\r\nsince. He was very generous and open-handed. He gave a noble collection\r\nof choice bookes and manuscripts to the Bodleian Library at Oxford,\r\nwhich remain there as an honourable monument of his munificence. ‘Twas\r\nthought, had he not been suddenly snatcht away by death, to the grief\r\nof all learned and good men, that he would have been a great benefactor\r\nto Pembroke College, in Oxford; whereas, there remains only from him\r\na great piece of plate that he gave there. He was a good scholar, and\r\ndelighted in poetrie; and did sometimes, for his diversion, write some\r\nsonnets and epigrammes which deserve commendation. Some of them are\r\nin print in a little book in 8vo., intituled ‘Poems writt by William,\r\nEarle of Pembroke, and Sir Benjamin Ruddyer, Knight, 1660.’”\r\n\r\nHis lordship married Mary, eldest daughter and co-heiress of\r\nGilbert, seventh Earl of Shrewsbury, by his countess, Mary, daughter\r\nof Sir William Cavendish, of Chatsworth, and his wife, Elizabeth\r\nHardwick—“Bess of Hardwick”—afterwards Countess of Shrewsbury. By\r\nthis marriage the Earl of Pembroke had two sons, who died in their\r\ninfancy. Dying without surviving issue, he was succeeded in the title\r\nand estates by his brother, Philip Herbert, who thus became fourth Earl\r\nof Pembroke, and was shortly afterwards created Earl of Montgomery, and\r\nappointed Lord Chamberlain, Gentleman of the King’s Bed-chamber, and\r\nLord Warden of the Stannaries. He was twice married: first, to Lady\r\nSusan Vere, daughter to the Earl of Oxford, by whom he had a numerous\r\nfamily; and, secondly, to Anne, daughter and heiress of George, Earl of\r\nCumberland, and widow of Richard, Earl of Dorset.\r\n\r\nDying in 1649-51, the Earl was succeeded by his fourth but eldest\r\nsurviving son, Philip, as Earl of Pembroke and Montgomery. This\r\nnobleman married, first, Penelope, daughter and heiress of Sir Robert\r\nNaunton; and, secondly, Catherine, daughter of Sir William Villiers,\r\nand, dying in 1669-70, was in his turn succeeded by the eldest son\r\nof his first marriage, William, who, dying unmarried, was succeeded\r\nby his half-brother, Philip (the son of his father by his second\r\nwife), who thus became seventh Earl of Pembroke, and fourth Earl of\r\nMontgomery. This nobleman married Henrietta de Querouaille, sister to\r\nthe Duchess of Portsmouth, but dying without male issue, the title\r\nand estates devolved on his younger brother, Thomas, eighth Earl of\r\nPembroke, who held distinguished offices under William III., Queen\r\nAnne, and George I., and was the founder of the noble collection of\r\nsculptures, &c., at Wilton. His lordship married three times, and was\r\nsucceeded by his eldest son, Henry, as ninth earl, of whose taste Lord\r\nOrford says, “Besides his works at Wilton, the new lodge in Windsor\r\nPark, the Countess of Suffolk’s house at Marble Hill, Twickenham, the\r\nwater house in Lord Orford’s park at Houghton, are incontestable proofs\r\nof his taste: it was more than taste, it was passion for the utility\r\nand honour of his country, that engaged his lordship to promote and\r\nassiduously overlook the construction of Westminster Bridge by the\r\ningenious Monsieur Labeyle.”\r\n\r\nHe was succeeded in the title and estates by his son, Henry, as tenth\r\nEarl of Pembroke and Earl of Montgomery, who, marrying Elizabeth,\r\nsecond daughter of Charles Spencer, Duke of Marlborough, had issue one\r\nson and one daughter, and, dying in 1794, was succeeded by his son,\r\nGeorge Augustus Herbert, as eleventh Earl of Pembroke, &c.\r\n\r\nThat nobleman married, first, in 1784, Elizabeth, daughter of Topham\r\nBeauclerk, Esq., son of Lord Sidney Beauclerk, and by her, who died\r\nin 1793, had issue the Lady Diana, married to the Earl of Normanton,\r\nand one son, Robert Henry, who succeeded him; and, secondly, in 1808,\r\nCatherine, daughter of Count Woronzow, the Russian ambassador, by whom\r\nhe had issue one son, the Hon. Sidney Herbert, M.P., and Secretary\r\nfor War, created, in 1861, Lord Herbert of Lea (which title has now\r\nmerged into the earldom of Pembroke), and five daughters—viz. the\r\nLady Elizabeth, married to the Earl of Clanwilliam; the Lady Mary\r\nCaroline; the Lady Catherine; the Lady Georgiana; and the Lady Emma.\r\nHis lordship, dying in 1827, was succeeded by the son of his first\r\nmarriage, Robert Henry Herbert, as twelfth Earl of Pembroke, &c. This\r\nnobleman was born in 1791, and married, in 1814, the Princess Octavia\r\nSpinelli, daughter of the Duke of Lorraine, and widow of the Sicilian\r\nPrince Buttera de Rubari, by whom he had no issue. He died in 1862, and\r\n(his half-brother, Sidney Herbert, Baron Herbert of Lea, the heir to\r\nthe title, having died a few months before him) was succeeded by his\r\nnephew (the son of that honoured statesman), George Robert Charles\r\nHerbert, the present peer—the thirteenth earl—then a minor.\r\n\r\nThe Right Hon. Sidney Herbert, who was born in 1810, married, in\r\n1846, Elizabeth, only daughter of Lieutenant-General Charles Ashe\r\nA’Court, who survives him, and is the present Baroness Herbert of\r\nLea. By her he had issue four sons and three daughters—viz. George\r\nRobert Charles Herbert, now Earl of Pembroke; Sidney, Lord Herbert,\r\nwho is heir-presumptive to his brother, and was born in 1853; William\r\nReginald Herbert, born in 1854; Michael Henry Herbert, born in 1857;\r\nMary Catherine Herbert, born in 1849; Elizabeth Maude Herbert, born in\r\n1851; and Constance Gwladys, born in 1859. Lord Herbert of Lea died in\r\n1861, and was succeeded in that title by his eldest son, George Robert\r\nCharles Herbert, then eleven years of age, and who, eight months later,\r\nsucceeded to the full family estates and earldom.\r\n\r\nThe present peer, the Right Hon. George Robert Charles, thirteenth\r\nEarl of Pembroke, Earl of Montgomery, Baron Herbert of Cardiff, Baron\r\nHerbert of Shurland, and Baron Herbert of Lea, Hereditary Visitor of\r\nJesus College, Oxford, and High Steward of Wilton, was born July 6th,\r\n1850, and succeeded his father as second Baron Herbert of Lea, in 1861,\r\nand his uncle as Earl of Pembroke and Montgomery, &c., in 1862. His\r\nlordship, in 1874, married the Lady Gertrude Frances Talbot, daughter\r\nof the eighteenth Earl of Shrewsbury, and sister of the present earl.\r\n\r\nThe arms of the Earl of Pembroke are—party per pale, _azure_ and\r\n_gules_, three lions rampant, _argent_. The crest is a wyvern, _vert_,\r\nholding in its mouth a sinister hand couped at the wrist, _gules_.\r\nThe supporters are—dexter, a panther guardant, _argent_, incensed,\r\nspotted, _or_, _vert_, _sable_, _azure_, and _gules_ alternately,\r\nducally collared, _azure_; sinister, a lion, _argent_, ducally\r\ncollared, _or_. Motto—“Ung je serviray.” The Earl is patron of twelve\r\nlivings, ten of which are in Wiltshire, one in Dorsetshire, and one in\r\nShropshire.\r\n\r\nHis lordship’s brothers and sisters, children of Lord Herbert of Lea,\r\nwere, on his succeeding to the earldom, raised to the rank of earls’\r\nchildren by royal warrant in 1862.\r\n\r\nWilton, a town of “great antiquity,” is situated at the conflux of the\r\nrivers Nadder and Willey, from the latter of which it is said to derive\r\nits name—“Willytown” or “Wilton:” “in Latin it is called Ellandunum.”\r\nThe ancient Britons had one of their chief seats here; it was a capital\r\nof the West Saxons, and was undoubtedly famous long before the Norman\r\nConquest. Afterwards it obtained renown from the number and importance\r\nof its monastic establishments. Leland informs us that it had over\r\ntwelve parish churches. Of its abbey there are no remains. It was\r\ndissolved in the thirty-fifth year of King Henry VIII., and the site\r\nand buildings given to Sir William Herbert, afterwards created Earl of\r\nPembroke; while from its relics Wilton House was principally built.[47]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Wilton, from the River._]\r\n\r\nWilton House—one of the grandest and most beautiful in the kingdom,\r\nand the entrance to which adjoins the town—stands on the site of a\r\nmonastery of Saxon foundation, which, on the dissolution, was levelled\r\nwith the ground. As we have just intimated, no portion whatever of the\r\nmonastic buildings remains, but there can be no doubt they were of\r\nconsiderable extent and importance. The mansion was built partly from\r\nthe designs, it is said, of Hans Holbein, to whom is ascribed the\r\nporch, which, however, in the early part of the present century was\r\nmuch altered. “The garden front was built by M. Solomon de Caus in the\r\nreign of Charles I., and, having been destroyed by fire in 1648, was\r\nre-erected by Webb from plans which are presumed to have been furnished\r\nby Inigo Jones. In the commencement of the present century the house\r\nwas considerably enlarged and remodelled by James Wyatt, R.A., one\r\nof the principal additions being the cloisters for the display and\r\npreservation of the magnificent collection of sculptures. The general\r\nplan of the house is a hollow square, the glazed cloister occupying the\r\ncentral space.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Cedars._]\r\n\r\nIn this Cloister, and in the Hall that leads to it, are the famous\r\n“marbles” which form so prominent a feature in the attractions of\r\nWilton—statues, busts, bassi-relievi, urns, vases, fragments of\r\nvarious kinds—a wonderful assemblage of remains of Greece and\r\nRome.[48] The collection was formed towards the close of the last\r\ncentury by Thomas, Earl of Pembroke, who purchased such of the Earl\r\nof Arundel’s collection as had been placed in the house, which were\r\nprincipally busts; to these he added many purchased at the dispersion\r\nof the Giustiniani collection of marbles, and also at the dispersion of\r\nthe Mazarin collection, and from various other sources.\r\n\r\nThe Hall contains several statues; but its interest is derived from the\r\nmany suits of armour by which it is adorned: they are chiefly trophies\r\nand memorials of the battle of St. Quentin, fought in 1557, in which\r\nthe Earl of Pembroke commanded the forces of England. One of the suits\r\nwas worn by the Earl, and two of them were, it is said, worn by the\r\nConstable Montmorency and the Duc de Montpensier, both taken prisoners\r\nat that eventful fight. A passage from the Hall leads to the Cloisters,\r\nfrom which, on either side, are entrances to the various apartments:\r\nthese are furnished with judgment and taste, but their attractions are\r\nthe pictures that adorn the walls.\r\n\r\nThe renowned “family picture” by Vandyke is beyond question the great\r\npainter’s masterpiece: it is 17 feet in length, by 11 feet in height,\r\nand fills one end of the drawing-room. It contains ten whole-length\r\nfigures, the two principal of which are Philip, Earl of Pembroke, and\r\nhis lady, Susan, daughter of Edward, Earl of Oxford. On the right stand\r\ntheir three sons, on the left their daughter and her husband, Robert,\r\nEarl of Carnarvon. Before them is Lady Mary, the wife of Charles, Lord\r\nHerbert, and above them, in the clouds, are two sons and a daughter who\r\ndied young. It is a most grand and glorious work, the value of which is\r\nnot to be estimated by money.\r\n\r\nThe room, which is called also the Cube Room, contains some thirteen\r\nother pictures, the productions of Vandyke.\r\n\r\nOther of the great old masters are well represented in the several\r\napartments of the mansion: many of them are, indeed, of great beauty\r\nand value.\r\n\r\nWe might occupy much space by printing a list of these pictures:\r\nthey comprise a large number of the great Italian artists. They are,\r\nhowever, such as one usually meets in these palatial residences, and\r\nare thrown into comparative obscurity by the glorious assemblage of\r\nVandykes.\r\n\r\nIn Lady Pembroke’s Summer Dressing-room there is a Gothic window by\r\nPrice, “to whom Parliament granted £5,000 for having discovered the\r\nancient method of staining glass.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Hall._]\r\n\r\nThe house is made thoroughly comfortable as a home; it has never been\r\nabandoned by the family, but has been their continual residence.\r\nEverywhere, consequently, there is an aspect of thorough comfort.\r\nGrace, elegance, and indeed splendour, are sufficiently apparent, but\r\nthe obvious study has long been to render the dwelling in all respects\r\nthe abode of an English nobleman who loved to live among his own\r\npeople. None will wonder at this who knew the late Lord Herbert of\r\nLea, who so long and so continuously lived in that delightful home.\r\n\r\nTo the Gardens and Grounds of Wilton House we desire to direct\r\nthe reader’s especial attention; they have been by no means left\r\nsolely to the guardianship of Nature. Art has done much to give\r\naid to the beauties of hill and dell, and river and wooded slopes\r\nand pasture-land. Immediately around the mansion the skill of the\r\ngardener is manifest: trim walks, and pastures, and summer-houses, and\r\nconservatories add to the natural grace and beauty of the scene. One\r\ngarden especially, into which there is a passage from the Drawing-room,\r\nis very beautifully laid out, overlooked by a graceful arcade, in which\r\nare vases and busts, and to which, no doubt, the family and their\r\nguests often retreat to enjoy the bounties of free air and light among\r\nthe adornments that are here so lavish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Drawing-room._]\r\n\r\nA most picturesque and singularly beautiful bridge joins the park\r\nto the grounds, crossing the Nadder. It was built from a design by\r\nPalladio, and has an open Ionic colonnade. The park slopes up from the\r\nriver; and in the grounds are some of the finest cedars to be seen in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nHere, it is said, Sir Philip Sidney wrote the “Arcadia;” and the\r\nmemorable book bears conclusive evidence that he drew much of his\r\ninspiration from these gardens and grounds. The book may be, as Milton\r\nstyles it, “a vain amatorious poem;” but it is full of beautiful\r\ndescriptions of Nature, and shows how dearly the chivalric writer\r\nreally loved the natural and the true; and it demands no strong stretch\r\nof fancy to imagine Philip Sidney, accompanied by William Shakspere,\r\nEdmund Spenser, and Philip Massinger (he was born in the place, and\r\nprobably in the house), walking among these now aged trees, along these\r\nembowered walks, and by the banks of the fair river that runs to enrich\r\nthem as it did centuries ago:—\r\n\r\n  “And all without were walkes and alleys dight\r\n  With divers trees enrang’d in even rankes;\r\n  And here and there were pleasant arbors pight,\r\n  And shadie seates and sundry flowring bankes,\r\n  To sit and rest the walker’s wearie shankes.”\r\n\r\nYes; it is obviously to these grounds and gardens that reference is\r\nmade in the “Arcadia:”—\r\n\r\n “There were hilles which garnished their proud heights with stately\r\n trees; humble vallies whose base estate seemed comforted with\r\n refreshing of silver rivers; medowes enamel with all sortes of\r\n eypleasing floures; thickets, which, being lined with most pleasant\r\n shade, were witnessed so too, by the cheerfull disposition of many\r\n well-tuned birds; each pasture stored with sheepe feeding with sober\r\n securitie, while the pretie lambes with bleating oratorie craved the\r\n dams’ comfort; here a shepheard’s boy piping as though he should neuer\r\n be old; there a young shepherdesse knitting and withall singing; and\r\n it seemed that her voice comforted her hands to worke, and her hands\r\n kept time to her voice’s musick.”\r\n\r\nIt is to-day as it was so long ago—when the sweetest of all the\r\nsingers and the most heroic of all the cavaliers of old times had\r\ntheir healthy walks through these woods, and their poetic “talks”\r\nunder the branches of these patrician trees—old then, and very old\r\nnow. Truly Wilton is “a place for pleasantnesse,” and “not unfit for\r\nsolitarinesse.”\r\n\r\n“Gloriana”—Queen Elizabeth—did certainly visit this “chosen plot of\r\nfertile land;” partook of “a very fair and pleasant banquet” in this\r\npark; and from Wilton she carried away many rich gifts, including “a\r\nmermaid of gold, having a maid upon her back garnished with sparks of\r\ndiamonds.”\r\n\r\nFrom a queen to a man of genius, who was a good man, is not a long\r\nleap. What visitor to Wilton will forget the name of that George\r\nHerbert who was the humble and faithful servant of God—who did His\r\nwork in this locality, and who, while he threw a line across the\r\nglistening Nadder (for he was the disciple as well as the friend of\r\nIzaak Walton), here wove those fancies into verse which after ages have\r\nnot suffered to die?\r\n\r\nAnd surely we may well close our notes on Wilton by quoting good old\r\nIzaak’s summary of the character of Lord Edward Herbert:—\r\n\r\n “He was one of the handsomest men of his day, of a beauty alike\r\n stately, chivalric, and intellectual. His person and features were\r\n cultivated by all the disciplines of a time when courtly graces were\r\n not insignificant, because a monarch-mind informed the court, nor\r\n warlike customs rude or mechanical, for industrial nature had free\r\n play in the field, except as restrained by the laws of courtesy and\r\n honour. The steel glove became his hand, and the spur his heel;\r\n neither can we fancy him out of his place, for any place he would have\r\n made his own.”\r\n\r\nThere is yet another of the worthies of Wilton to claim and receive\r\nthe homage of every visitor—the Right Hon. Sidney Herbert, created\r\nLord Herbert of Lea before his premature death. He did not outlive his\r\nbrother, the Earl, but his son inherited the titles and estates, and is\r\nnow, as we have stated, the thirteenth Earl of Pembroke.\r\n\r\nThere is a statue of Sidney Herbert, by Marochetti, in the Market-place\r\nat Salisbury; and a far better statue of him, by Foley, fronts the War\r\nOffice in Pall Mall: it honours him as the Secretary of War, and makes\r\nrecord of some of his triumphs as the gentle and genial advocate of\r\npeace and Christian charity to all mankind. “Sidney Herbert,” says Mr.\r\nHall, who was associated with him as one of the Honorary Secretaries\r\nof the Nightingale Fund, “seemed to me a copy, and without an atom\r\ndeteriorated, of his renowned relative-predecessor, Lord Herbert\r\nof Cherbury. He lived in another age, and had to discharge very\r\ndifferent duties; but there was the same heroic sentiment, the same\r\nhigh chivalry, the same generous sympathy with suffering, the same\r\nstern and steady resolve to right the wrong. It is not too much to say\r\nthat what we may have imagined of the chivalry of a past age we have\r\nwitnessed in our own: a gentleman who gave dignity to the loftiest\r\nrank; who thought it no condescension to be kind and courteous to\r\nthe very humblest who approached him. To rare personal advantages he\r\nadded those of large intellectual acquirements. He spoke, if not as an\r\norator, with impressive eloquence; as a man of practical business, few\r\nwere his superiors; he had the mind of a statesman, yet gave earnest\r\nand thoughtful care to all the minor details of life. His death was a\r\npublic calamity.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The New Church at Wilton._]\r\n\r\nNo one who visits Wilton—either the town or the mansion—will leave\r\nit without seeing and examining “the New Church,” of which we give\r\nan engraving. It was erected in 1844, at the cost of Sidney Herbert,\r\nthe architects being F. H. Wyatt and D. Brandon. The style, as will\r\nbe perceived, is that of the ordinary Romanesque. It is a singularly\r\nbeautiful and very gorgeous structure, built without regard to\r\nexpense: perhaps there is nothing more perfect, of its class, in the\r\nkingdom. The following details from a local newspaper give a technical\r\ndescription of this edifice:—\r\n\r\n “The church is raised on a terrace with a noble flight of steps 100\r\n feet long, and a platform 20 feet in width. The centre entrance of the\r\n east front forms an open-recessed porch within a rich archway, which\r\n contains four columns on each side. Over this centre entrance is a\r\n series of small circular-headed arches, forming a sort of exterior\r\n gallery at the back of the one within, and producing a good deal\r\n of relief and richness. Immediately above it is a very large rose\r\n window, of elaborate design, set within a square, whose spandrils\r\n are sculptured with the emblems of the four evangelists. The lofty\r\n campanile tower is connected with the south-east angle of the building\r\n by a vestibule or cloister, whose elaborately carved open arches and\r\n columns present a pleasing contrast to the breadth and solidity of\r\n the other parts. On the same side of the church, at the west end, is\r\n a projecting porch (or vestry), which naturally increases the play\r\n and picturesqueness of the composition. Upon entering the rich door\r\n in the east front, already described, we pass between two screens of\r\n twisted columns, dividing the gallery staircase from the centre porch.\r\n Immediately opposite to this entrance is placed the font, a massive\r\n structure of black and variegated Italian marble. It is carved with\r\n lions’ heads at the corners, and the basin is richly foliated. The\r\n pedestal is of white marble in panels, inlaid with vine-leaves in\r\n black marble. The whole is raised on a black marble plinth.... The\r\n pulpit is of stone, inlaid with panels of marble, and glittering with\r\n rich mosaic-work, having also four twisted columns wholly composed\r\n of ancient mosaic, and supported by the black marble columns with\r\n alabaster capitals. The roofing of the nave and aisles is of open\r\n timber-work, stained to imitate dark chestnut.... The height of the\r\n campanile is 100 feet; and in it are hung a peal of six bells, brought\r\n from the old church. The remaining dimensions are as under: from the\r\n western porch to the chancel apse, 120 feet; width, 53 feet; width of\r\n nave between the columns, 24 feet; height, 57 feet; aisles, 13 feet\r\n wide, and 24 feet high.”\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting places in Wilton is the famous “Royal\r\nAxminster and Wilton Carpet Factory” of Messrs. Yates and Co., and\r\nthis, through the courtesy of the proprietors, may be seen by visitors\r\nto this district. This manufactory, which occupies nearly two acres\r\nof ground and gives employment to nearly four hundred people, was the\r\nfirst place in England where carpets were made. A charter was granted\r\nin 1701, and other charters of 1706 and 1725 (by which the weavers were\r\nmade a corporate body, with stewards, &c.) were also granted. By these\r\nall persons who were not members of the body of weavers were prevented\r\nfrom carrying on the same business within three miles of the borough\r\nof Wilton, stamped certificates, after seven years’ apprenticeship,\r\nbeing given by the corporation to such men as were elected by them.\r\nThe carpets then made were naturally of a coarse and very inferior\r\ncharacter to those produced after on. To Henry, ninth Earl of Pembroke\r\nand sixth Earl of Montgomery, of whom we have spoken in a preceding\r\npage, and who died in 1751, England is indebted for the introduction\r\nof the manufacture of superior descriptions of carpets. Like many of\r\nhis ancestors, he was a man of refined taste, and spent large sums\r\nof money in adorning his mansion at Wilton. Lord Orford says of him,\r\n“The soul of Inigo Jones, who had been patronised by his ancestors,\r\nseems still to hover over its favourite Wilton, and to have assisted\r\nthe muses of Art in the education of this noble person. The towers,\r\nthe chambers, the scenes which Holbein, Jones, and Vandyke decorated,\r\nand which Earl Thomas had enriched with the spoil of the best ages,\r\nreceived the last touches of beauty from Earl Henry’s hand.” The Earl\r\nduring his travels in Flanders and France had taken great interest\r\nin the carpet works of those countries, and he noticed the much more\r\ngeneral use of this article of furniture there than in England, where\r\nit was then regarded as an exotic luxury, and the idea occurred to him\r\nthat the manufacture might be established in England, so as to form a\r\nnew industry, and be a source of employment to the poor. He therefore\r\nentered into arrangements with artists, superintendents, and a body of\r\nworkmen; brought them to England about the year 1745; and settled them\r\nin Wilton—thus laying the foundation of that branch of manufacture\r\nwhich now in England surpasses by far that of any other country.\r\n\r\nThe productions of this famous historical factory, to which, years\r\nago, the looms and trade from Axminster were transferred, are entirely\r\nhand-made, and in this particular the manufactory is the only one in\r\nexistence in this kingdom. Carpets of various degrees of quality and of\r\ndifferent descriptions are here made, but whether “Brussels,” “Saxony,”\r\n“Velvet-pile,” “Axminster,” or what not, all are “real hand-made,” and\r\nall of extreme excellence, both in design and in superiority of make.\r\n“Royal carpets” for Windsor Castle, for Buckingham Palace, and other\r\nabodes of royalty, may now and then be seen by the visitor in course\r\nof weaving, and many of these better-class carpets, which are an inch\r\nor more in thickness, and of the softness of down to the tread, are of\r\nthe most gorgeous character in design and in brilliancy and arrangement\r\nof colours. A “Wilton carpet” indicates a high degree of refinement in\r\nfurnishing, and its enduring quality gives it a strong recommendation.\r\n\r\nWilton House is within three miles of venerable Salisbury, six miles\r\nor so from Stonehenge, and some three or four miles from “Old Sarum;”\r\nthe visitor may, therefore, with but little sacrifice of time, examine\r\nthree of the most interesting of all the relics of ancient England,\r\nwhile Wilton itself may well be ranked as a fourth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Salisbury Cathedral._]\r\n\r\nIf we have cathedrals grander, more extensive, and more magnificent\r\nthan that of Salisbury, we have none more graceful: “the singular\r\nuniformity displayed in its design and style, the harmony which\r\npervades its several parts and proportions, and the striking air of\r\nbrightness, simplicity, and elegance, that reigns throughout the whole,\r\nall conspire to invest it with a charm peculiarly its own; whilst the\r\ngreat elevation of its graceful spire renders it without exception the\r\nmost lofty building in the kingdom.” Grace is, indeed, its especial\r\nattribute, and beauty has not been here “a fatal gift;” for the sacred\r\nedifice seems as perfect to-day as it was many centuries ago.\r\n\r\nStonehenge is near at hand; that wonderful assemblage of stones which\r\ntell us—nothing, defying even the guess-work of the antiquary,\r\nconcerning which tradition is dumb; yet there they stand as they stood\r\nthousands of years ago, solitary in their solemn grandeur upon the\r\nplain where the grouse and hares are even now their only neighbours.\r\n\r\n“Old Sarum” seems but a huge waste heap: it rises high above environing\r\nscenery; there are no dwellings on the “mound”—not even one where\r\nmight have been registered the return to Parliament of the member by\r\nwhom it was represented, until Reform arrested its chronicles, and\r\nswept it away as a city for ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRABY CASTLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEW counties are so rich in ancient fortresses and castellated\r\nbuildings as Durham; but pre-eminent among these in historical\r\ninterest, and perhaps in antiquity, is Raby Castle, which we add to our\r\nseries. Situate about six or seven miles from Barnard Castle, a trifle\r\nmore than that from Bishop Auckland, and about a dozen from Darlington,\r\nRaby Castle, with its grand old park, lies close to the pretty little\r\ntown of Staindrop, about which we shall say a few words later on. The\r\ncastle itself, with its many massive towers and turrets, is built on\r\nrising ground, on a foundation of solid rock, and is surrounded and\r\nenclosed by a massive battlemented wall, the area of the edifice,\r\nwithin the wall, comprising about two acres of land. The castle was\r\nformerly surrounded by a moat, the course of which, although now filled\r\nup, is clearly traceable; in its place extensive sheets of ornamental\r\nwater have been very judiciously laid out, and give to the scene the\r\neffect, in approaching the castle from the park, of a fine but placid\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nRaby Park, which surrounds the castle, consists of several hundred\r\nacres of the finest land, and contains a noble herd of more than five\r\nhundred red and fallow deer. The park is entered by three Lodges of\r\nancient and unpretentious appearance. The South Lodge, which is the\r\nmain entrance, is situated about one hundred yards from Staindrop\r\nChurch. On entering the Lodge, within a very short distance from here\r\nthe towers of the castle are visible, and continue in sight for some\r\nconsiderable distance, when a sharp incline cuts off the view. On\r\nattaining the summit the grand old pile is again seen standing boldly\r\nout from the grounds, and forming a most imposing prospect, which is\r\ngreatly enhanced by the sheet of water that at this point separates\r\nthe castle from the observer. The carriage drive from the Lodge has\r\nhitherto been wavy and circuitous in its route, but from here it takes\r\na straight course across the Pond, or Lake, of ten acres in extent,\r\nby means of an embankment, and again continues in a circuitous form\r\nthrough an avenue of grand old venerable beech-trees, which terminates\r\nat the entrance, or Porter’s Lodge, to the castle itself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _South Side._]\r\n\r\nThe Pond, or Lake, which is divided by the carriage drive, is situated\r\non the west side of the castle, its western portion overflowing into\r\nthe eastern half, that flows to and surrounds the south battlement\r\nwalls; the Moat, which is now dry, receding from it to the east and\r\nwest. The Lake is well supplied with swans and other aquatic birds.\r\n\r\nThe East Lodge is a foot entrance for the workpeople; the North Lodge,\r\nor back entrance, has two low castellated towers, one on each side of\r\nthe entrance gates.\r\n\r\nThe Home Park and Woods consist of nine hundred and forty acres, which\r\nare intersected by fifteen miles of drives and walks. The Woods are\r\nbeautifully varied and picturesque, especially the North Wood, which\r\nforms the north boundary of the park, and rises considerably above the\r\ncastle, commanding a most extensive and charming landscape, especially\r\non a clear sunset evening, when the old dark walls of the castle are\r\nlit up by its golden rays, which are also reflected on the far-distant\r\nYorkshire and Richmond hills.\r\n\r\nThe Bath Wood, which is quite of a different nature from the North\r\nWood, is situated a short distance to the west of the castle in a\r\nvalley that is thickly wooded, and through which walks and drives\r\nwind their way in such varied forms as to render it one of the most\r\nenjoyable summer retreats that can possibly be desired. The walks and\r\ndrives all terminate at the Bath-house, somewhat west of the centre of\r\nthe wood. In front of the Bath, which consists of two rooms, supplied\r\nby a natural spring of intensely cold water, is a fine open lawn, well\r\nlaid out with rhododendron beds and single specimens of conifers, with\r\na lake-stream of water winding its way in various falls and artificial\r\nforms. This open space, or lawn, is thickly surrounded with grand old\r\nbeech and spruce-fir trees, blending most charmingly together. At the\r\nback and on the north side of the Bath-house is a picturesquely built\r\nlodge or cottage, inhabited by persons who have charge of the Baths.\r\n\r\nThe Gardens are situated on the north side of the castle, on a slight\r\nincline, which commands some of the most interesting views of the north\r\nside of the building. The whole grounds pertaining to the Gardens,\r\nincluding the head and under gardeners’ dwellings, are enclosed within\r\nsubstantial time-worn brick walls, which are strictly in keeping with\r\nthe castle itself. The interior is formed into various sections by\r\nbrick walls and massive yew hedges, that are kept closely clipped in\r\ntapering form; in measure they are ten feet wide, and eleven feet high,\r\nand probably were planted in the days of the first occupiers of the\r\ncastle. Formerly these sections were almost exclusively devoted to\r\nthe culture of fruit and vegetables, but of late years bedding plants\r\nof all descriptions have been extensively introduced, associating\r\nvery agreeably the ornamental with the useful. On a terrace which is\r\nbounded on one side by a stream of water is a ribbon border extending\r\nits whole length; and on the south side of the boundary wall the\r\neffect produced by the bends and receding form of the border is very\r\ncharming, and the perfection of what a ribbon border should be. Glass\r\nstructures are extensive, and principally devoted to fruit culture,\r\nespecially to pines and grapes. Excepting the Conservatory and two or\r\nthree other houses containing some very fine specimens of tropical\r\nplants, plant culture is little regarded. Most of these houses have\r\nbeen reconstructed on the most approved modern principles, but they are\r\nscattered about in all directions. The noble range of vineries erected\r\nsome thirty years since, that contained the vines which caused so much\r\ncontroversy amongst horticulturists on the carrion system of vine\r\nculture, are now things of the past, and are succeeded by fine healthy\r\ncanes, which must, to all present appearance, produce in the future\r\nfruit of the most approved excellence. In addition to the many glass\r\nstructures devoted to fruit culture, hot-air walls are also introduced\r\nfor the same purpose, which, especially in the case of apricots, insure\r\na full crop in spite of unpropitious weather.\r\n\r\nThe most-cared-for antique occupant in the Garden is, however, the\r\nfamous “Raby Fig-tree,” which, although known to be upwards of one\r\nhundred years old, still produces annually thousands of figs of the\r\nfinest quality. This remarkable tree is covered by a primitive glass\r\nstructure, very much in keeping with its own venerable character. The\r\nhouse in which the tree is planted is fifty feet in length, eight feet\r\nin width, and nearly twelve feet in height; and every possible space of\r\nthis house, both walls and rafters, is occupied by this one tree, which\r\nbids fair to live and flourish and produce fruit for many a century\r\nyet to come. The house is heated by flues. Another speciality of the\r\nGardens is the original “Raby Red Currant,” whose trees are still in as\r\ngood preservation, as prolific, and as much in repute as ever.\r\n\r\nThe name of Raby points to a Danish origin, and it is first named, so\r\nfar as any record is known, in connection with King Canute, who, after\r\nmaking his celebrated pilgrimage over Garmondsway Moor to the shrine of\r\nSt. Cuthbert at Durham, offered it, with Staindrop and its shire, to\r\nthe shrine of that saint. It continued, except for a time during the\r\nlife of Bishop Flambard, in the peaceful possession of the monks until\r\n1131, when they granted it, for an annual rent of £4, to Dolfin, son of\r\nUghtred, of the blood royal of Northumberland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _North-east Side._]\r\n\r\nTo him, Mr. Hodgson is of opinion, is to be ascribed the first\r\nfoundation of the manor. The descendant of Dolfin, Robert Fitz-Maldred,\r\nlineal heir to Ughtred, Earl of Northumberland, was described as\r\n“Dominus de Raby,” when, early in the thirteenth century, he married\r\nIsabel de Nevil (daughter to Geoffrey de Nevil, the grandson of Gilbert\r\nde Nevil, who came over with the Conqueror, by the daughter and sole\r\nheiress of Bertram de Bulmer), who, by the death of her brother, the\r\nlast male of his line, became sole heiress and representative of the\r\ngreat Saxon house of Bulmer, Lords of Brancepath and Sheriff-Hutton.\r\nTheir son Geoffrey assumed his mother’s surname of Nevil, and thus laid\r\nafresh the foundation of the great house of that name. He had issue\r\ntwo sons—Robert, who succeeded him, and Geoffrey, who became Constable\r\nof Scarborough Castle and Justice Itinerant, and from whom the Nevils\r\nof Hornby, afterwards merged in the Beauforts, descended. Robert de\r\nNevil, who was Governor of Norham, Werke, York, Devizes, and Bamborough\r\nCastles, Warden of all the King’s forests north of the Trent, Justice\r\nItinerant, General of all forces beyond the Trent, and Sheriff of\r\nYorkshire, joined the rebellious barons, but was afterwards restored\r\nto favour. His son Robert, called the “Peacock of the North,” dying\r\nwithout issue during his lifetime, this elder Robert was succeeded by\r\nRalph de Nevil, who took a prominent part in the troublous internal\r\nwars of his time. He in turn was succeeded by his son, John de Nevil,\r\nBaron of Raby, who was Admiral of the King’s fleet from the Thames\r\nnorthward, Warden of the East Marches, Lieutenant of the Duchy of\r\nAquitaine, and Seneschal of Bordeaux. He died 12th Richard II., and was\r\nsucceeded by his eldest son, Ralph, his second son being Thomas, Lord\r\nFurnival. This John, Lord Nevil, was the builder of the present castle\r\nof Raby.\r\n\r\nRalph, Lord Nevil of Raby, held many important offices, and founded\r\nthe collegiate church of Staindrop. By his first wife, Margaret,\r\ndaughter of Hugh, Earl of Stafford, he had issue two sons—John, who\r\ndied during his father’s lifetime, and Ralph, “who married the daughter\r\nand heir of Ferrers of Oversley, by whom he had John Nevil, called\r\nLord Ferrers, whose daughter Joan (heir to the baronies of Oversley\r\nand Newmarch), being married to Sir William Gascoigne, brought forth\r\nMargaret Gascoigne, their daughter and heir, wife to Wentworth; whence\r\nthe Barons Raby of that surname do descend”—and seven daughters:\r\nMaud, married to Baron de Mauley; Alice, to Sir Thomas Grey; Philippa,\r\nto Baron Dacres of Gillesland; Margaret, to Baron Scrope; Anne, to\r\nSir Gilbert de Umfraville; Margery and Elizabeth, nuns. His second\r\nwife was Joan, daughter of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, “by\r\nwhom he had issue eight sons—Richard, Earl of Salisbury; William,\r\nBaron Falconberg; George, Baron Latimer; Edward, Baron Bergavenny;\r\nRobert, Bishop of Durham; Cuthbert, Henry, and Thomas, which three\r\nlast died issueless. Also five daughters—Catherine, married first to\r\nJohn Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk, secondly to Thomas Strangways, Esq.,\r\nthirdly to John, Viscount Beaumont, and lastly to Sir John Widville,\r\nKnight; Eleanor, or Elizabeth, to Richard, Baron Spencer, secondly to\r\nHenry Percy, Earl of Northumberland; Anne, to Humphrey, Duke of Bucks,\r\nand afterwards to Walter Blunt, Baron Mountjoy; Jane, a nun; and\r\nCiceley, to Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York.” He was created Earl\r\nof Westmoreland, being “the first who was made earl of this county;”\r\nand at his death, in the 4th of Henry VI., he was succeeded by his\r\ngrandson, Ralph Nevil, as second Earl of Westmoreland and Baron Nevil\r\nof Raby, who in turn was succeeded by his cousin, Ralph Nevil, son to\r\nSir John Nevil, as third Earl of Westmoreland. He married Margaret,\r\ndaughter of Sir Roger Booth, by whom he had issue, with others, one\r\nson, who died in his father’s lifetime, leaving a son, Ralph, who in\r\nturn succeeded his grandfather.\r\n\r\nRalph, fourth Earl of Westmoreland and Baron Nevil of Raby, married\r\nCatherine, daughter of Edward Stafford, Duke of Buckinghamshire, by\r\nwhom he had issue seven sons and five daughters, and was, at his death,\r\nsucceeded by his eldest son, Henry Nevil, as fifth earl. This earl\r\nmarried Anne, daughter to Thomas Manners, Earl of Rutland, by whom,\r\namongst others, he had issue a son, Charles, who succeeded him as fifth\r\nEarl of Westmoreland and Baron Nevil of Raby.\r\n\r\nThis nobleman, Charles, fifth Earl of Westmoreland, having taken\r\nan active part in the rebellion against Queen Elizabeth, known as\r\nthe “Rising in the North,” was defeated, and all his possessions\r\nconfiscated to the Crown. He left only female issue.\r\n\r\nRaby, having passed into the hands of the Crown, was afterwards sold to\r\nthe Vanes, to which family we now draw attention.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that Raby Castle holds a very high rank among the\r\nancient castles of England, and is one of the few of its old glories\r\nthat continue to be the habitation of its lords.\r\n\r\nThe family of Vane, of which the Duke of Cleveland, the owner of Raby\r\nCastle, is the head, is of very high antiquity, and, unlike many of our\r\nnoted families, has been continued in unbroken succession from at least\r\nthe time of the Norman Conquest down to the present hour. The first of\r\nwhom we have any authentic record—although doubtless the family might\r\nbe traced much further back still—is Howell ap Vane, who was living in\r\nMonmouthshire antecedently to the Conquest. His son, Griffith ap Howell\r\nVane, married Lettyce, daughter of Bledwyn ap Kynvyn, Lord of Powys,\r\nwho was founder of three noble tribes of Wales, and by usurpation\r\nsovereign of North and South Wales. Their son was Enyon, or Ivon,\r\n“the Fair,” who married a daughter of Owen ap Edwyn Meredith. Passing\r\non through the next three generations, we come to Sir Henry Vane,\r\nknighted at the battle of Poitiers, in 1356, where he claimed to have\r\nassisted in taking prisoner John, King of France, who, in token of his\r\ncaptivity, took off his dexter gauntlet and gave it to Vane: from that\r\nmoment he adopted it as his cognisance, and it has been continued both\r\nas a crest and as a charge on the shield of arms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _South and East Sides._]\r\n\r\nHe married Grace, daughter of Sir Stephen de la Leke, and was succeeded\r\nby his son, John Vane, whose great-grandson, Henry Vane (his elder\r\nbrother having died without issue), married Isabella, daughter of Henry\r\nPersall, or Peshall, by whom he had a family of eight sons and two\r\ndaughters, and, in default of issue of the eldest two, was succeeded\r\nby his third son, John Vane (whose younger brother, Sir Ralph Vane,\r\nmarried Elizabeth, known as “the good Lady Vane,” and was knighted at\r\nthe siege of Bulleyn, in 1544; he afterwards purchased Penshurst,\r\nwas attainted 4th Edward VI., executed on Tower Hill, and his estates\r\nforfeited). John Vane, who was of Hilden, in Kent, assumed the name of\r\nFane in lieu of Vane, and married Isabella, daughter of John Darknoll,\r\nor Darrell, and was succeeded by their second son, Richard Fane,\r\nof Tudeley, at whose death, in 1540, he was succeeded by his only\r\nson, George Fane, of Badsall, who married Joan, daughter of William\r\nWaller, of Groombridge, from whom the present Earl of Westmoreland is\r\ndescended. The fourth son of John Vane, or Fane, of Hilden, was John\r\nFane, who was in possession of Hadlow when his uncle, Sir Ralph, was\r\nexecuted. He married Joan, daughter and co-heiress of Sir Edward Hawte,\r\nof Tonbridge, by whom, with others, he had a son, his successor, Henry\r\nFane, of Hadlow, who took part in Wyatt’s insurrection, was committed\r\nto the Tower, but afterwards pardoned and released.\r\n\r\nHis grandson, Sir Henry Fane, resumed the ancient patronymic of\r\nhis family, Vane, in lieu of Fane, and this has continued to the\r\npresent time. This Henry Fane, or Vane, was knighted in 1611, and was\r\nconstituted one of the regents of the kingdom for the safe keeping\r\nof the Queen, Prince Charles, and the rest of the royal children. In\r\n1616, on the disgrace of Robert Carr of Fernyhurst, Earl of Somerset,\r\nSir Henry Vane received a lease from the trustees for support of the\r\nhousehold of Charles, Prince of Wales, for the remainder of the term\r\ngranted to Carr. He was principal Secretary of State to James I., and\r\nCofferer of the Household to Charles I. In 1626 he purchased the castle\r\nand manor of Raby, and in 1632 was sent as ambassador to Sweden to\r\nexpostulate with Gustavus Adolphus in favour of the Elector Palatine.\r\nIn the following year he nobly entertained the King at Raby, on his\r\njourney to and from Scotland, on the occasion of his coronation. He\r\nmarried Frances, daughter of Thomas Darcy, of Tolleshunt Darcy, and\r\ndied at Raby Castle in 1654. By this union he had seven sons—viz.\r\nThomas and John, who died in infancy; Sir Henry Vane, who succeeded\r\nhim; and Sir George Vane, from whom the Marquis of Londonderry, who\r\nsits as Earl Vane, is descended; Sir Walter Vane, Charles Vane, and\r\nWilliam Vane—and eight daughters, among whom were Margaret, married to\r\nSir Thomas Pelham, from whom are descended the Duke of Newcastle and\r\nthe Earl of Chichester; and Frances, wife of Sir Robert Honeywood.\r\n\r\nSir Henry Vane (third son), who succeeded his father in the estates of\r\nRaby, Fairlawn, Shipborne, &c., in 1654, had a very chequered, but\r\nhistorical life. He was educated at Westminster and Oxford, proceeded\r\nto Geneva, and afterwards to America, where he was elected Governor\r\nof Massachusetts. He was also M.P. for Hull and other places, and was\r\nknighted in 1640. He is characterized as “one of the most turbulent\r\nenthusiasts produced by the rebellion, and an inflexible Republican,”\r\nby some, but by Milton as\r\n\r\n “Vane, young in years, but in sage counsel old.”\r\n\r\nIn 1659 he was, in Pepys’s own words, “this day voted out of the House,\r\nand to sit no more there; and that he would retire himself to his house\r\nat Raby.” And again, a month later, “This day, by an order of the\r\nHouse, Sir H. Vane was sent out of town to his house in Lincolnshire.”\r\nIn 1661 he, with Lambert and others, was sent prisoner to Scilly.\r\nHe had in former years been joined with Sir William Russell in the\r\noffice of Treasurer of the Navy, which yielded an annual income of\r\n£30,000; but although, as survivor of Russell, the whole of this was\r\nhis by patent for life, he voluntarily and disinterestedly gave it up\r\nto Parliament, reserving only a salary of £2,000 a year for an agent.\r\nA series of charges having been drawn up against Vane—principally\r\narising out of his just indignation at the title of Raby having been\r\nbestowed upon the Earl of Strafford—he was, on the 6th of June, 1662,\r\nfound guilty of high treason, and, on the 14th of the same month,\r\nbeheaded on Tower Hill. Of this execution it is needless to give any\r\nparticulars beyond those written, the same day, by Pepys. He says, “Up\r\nby four o’clock in the morning and upon business at my office. Then we\r\nsat down to business, and about eleven o’clock, having a room got ready\r\nfor us, we all went out to the Tower Hill; and there over against the\r\nscaffold, made on purpose this day, saw Sir Henry Vane brought. A very\r\ngreat press of people. He made a long speech, many times interrupted by\r\nthe sheriffe and others there; and they would have taken his paper out\r\nof his hand, but he would not let it go. But they caused all the books\r\nof those that writ after him to be given the sheriffe; and the trumpets\r\nwere brought under the scaffold that he might not be heard. Then he\r\nprayed and so fitted himself, and received the blow; but the scaffold\r\nwas so crowded that we could not see it done. But Boreman, who had been\r\nupon the scaffold, came to us and told us, that first he began to speak\r\nof the irregular proceeding against him; that he was, against Magna\r\nCharta, denied to have his exceptions against the indictment allowed:\r\nand that there he was stopped by the sheriffe. Then he drew out his\r\npaper of notes, and began to tell them first his life; that he was born\r\na gentleman, that he was bred up and had the quality of a gentleman,\r\nand to make him in the opinion of the world more a gentleman, he\r\nhad been till he was seventeen years old a good fellow, but then it\r\npleased God to lay a foundation of grace in his heart by which he was\r\npersuaded, against his worldly interest, to leave all preferment and\r\ngo abroad, where he might serve God with more freedom. Then he was\r\ncalled home and made a member of the Long Parliament, where he never\r\ndid to this day anything against his conscience, but all for the glory\r\nof God. Here he would have given them an account of the proceedings of\r\nthe Long Parliament, but they so often interrupted him that at last\r\nhe was forced to give over, and so fell into prayer for England in\r\ngenerall, then for the churches of England, and then for the City of\r\nLondon: and so fitted himself for the block, and received the blow. He\r\nhad a blister, or issue, upon his neck, which he desired them not hurt:\r\nhe changed not his colour or speech to the last, but died justifying\r\nhimself and the cause he had stood for; and spake very confidently of\r\nhis being presently at the right hand of Christ; and in all things\r\nappeared the most resolved man that ever died in that manner, and\r\nshowed more of heate than cowardice, but yet with all humility and\r\ngravity. One asked him why he did not pray for the King? He answered,\r\n‘Nay,’ says he, ‘you shall see I can pray for the King: I pray God\r\nbless him!’ The King had given his body to his friends, and, therefore,\r\nhe told them that he hoped they would be civil to his body when dead;\r\nand desired they would let him die like a gentleman and a Christian,\r\nand not crowded and pressed as he was.”\r\n\r\nThis unfortunate, but gifted member of the family of Vane had married,\r\nin 1639, Frances, daughter of Sir Christopher Wray, Bart., of Ashby\r\nand Glentworth, in Lincolnshire, by whom he had issue seven sons,\r\nfive of whom died young. The fifth son was Sir Christopher Vane, who\r\nwas knighted in 1688, made a Privy Councillor, and in July, 1699,\r\ncreated Baron Barnard of Barnard Castle, county of Durham. He married\r\nElizabeth, eldest daughter of Gilbert Holles, third Earl of Clare, and\r\nsister of John Holles, Duke of Newcastle. By her Baron Barnard had\r\nissue, with others, a son—Gilbert Vane, who succeeded him; and another\r\nson—William Vane, who was created Viscount Vane and Baron Duncannon.\r\nThis Viscount Vane married Lucy, daughter of William Jolliffe, Esq.,\r\nof Caverswall, in Staffordshire, and was father, by her, of William\r\nHolles Vane, second Viscount, whose wife (Frances, daughter of Francis\r\nHawes, of Purley Hall, and widow of Lord William Hamilton) was the\r\nnotorious Lady Vane, whose intrigues and disreputable course of life\r\nform the subject of the “Memoirs of a Lady of Quality” in “Peregrine\r\nPickle,” which were “written by herself, which she coolly told her lord\r\nto read.”\r\n\r\nGilbert Vane, second Baron Barnard, who succeeded his father, the first\r\nbaron, in 1723, and died in 1753, married Mary, daughter and heiress\r\nof Morgan Randyll, of Chilworth, by whom he had six sons and three\r\ndaughters. His eldest son and successor was Henry, third Baron Barnard,\r\na Lord of the Treasury, who, in 1754, was advanced to the dignity of\r\nViscount Barnard and Earl of Darlington. This nobleman, of whom Lord\r\nOrford wrote, “He never said a false thing nor did a bad one,” married,\r\nin 1725, the Lady Grace, daughter of Charles Fitzroy, first Duke of\r\nCleveland, by whom he had issue three sons and three daughters. The\r\neldest son was Lord Henry Vane, who succeeded his father as second Earl\r\nof Darlington and fourth Baron Barnard; he married Margaret, sister of\r\nthe first Earl of Lonsdale; and, dying in 1792, was succeeded by their\r\neldest son, William Henry, as fifth baron and third earl.\r\n\r\nThis nobleman, who held many important appointments, was born in 1766;\r\nin 1827 he was advanced to the dignity of Marquis of Cleveland; and\r\nin 1833 was again advanced to the title of Duke of Cleveland, and had\r\nthe barony of Raby conferred upon him. He was married twice: first, in\r\n1787, to the Lady Katharine Margaretta Powlett, daughter and co-heiress\r\nof the sixth and last Duke of Bolton, and a co-heiress of the barony\r\nof St. John of Basing; and secondly, in 1813, to Elizabeth Russell,\r\nof Newton House, Yorkshire. By his first marriage the Duke had issue\r\nthree sons (who have each in succession become Dukes of Cleveland) and\r\nfive daughters—one of whom, Lady Louisa Catherine Barbara, married a\r\nbrother of the first Lord Forester, and another, the Lady Arabella,\r\nmarried the third Lord Alvanley. The Duke was succeeded at his death,\r\nin 1842, by his eldest son—\r\n\r\nHenry Vane, second duke and marquis, third earl and viscount, and sixth\r\nbaron, who was born in 1788, and died, without issue, in 1864, having\r\nmarried, in 1809, Lady Sophia, daughter of the fourth Earl Powlett. He\r\nwas succeeded by his brother, William John Frederick Vane, as third\r\nduke and marquis, fourth earl and viscount, and seventh baron, who\r\nassumed the surname of Powlett in lieu of that of Vane, but in 1864\r\nresumed his original patronymic of Vane. His grace married, in 1815,\r\nCaroline, fourth daughter of the first Earl of Lonsdale, but died\r\nwithout issue in 1864, when he was in turn succeeded in his titles and\r\nestates by his brother, the present Duke of Cleveland.\r\n\r\nThe present noble head of this grand old family, whose genealogy we\r\nhave thus briefly traced, is Harry George Powlett (late Vane), Duke\r\nof Cleveland, Marquis of Cleveland, Earl of Darlington, Viscount\r\nBarnard of Barnard Castle, Baron Barnard, and Baron Raby, a Knight of\r\nthe Garter, &c. His grace is, as has been shown, a son of the first\r\nDuke of Cleveland, and brother of the second and third dukes. He was\r\nborn in 1803, and succeeded to the titles and estates in 1864, when,\r\nby royal license, he assumed the surname and arms of Powlett in lieu\r\nof those of Vane. His grace, who was educated at Eton and at Oriel\r\nCollege, Oxford, was attached to the embassy at Paris in 1829, and\r\nwas appointed Secretary of Legation at Stockholm in 1839. In 1854 he\r\nmarried Lady Catherine Lucy Wilhelmina Stanhope, daughter of the late\r\nEarl Stanhope (President of the Society of Antiquaries), and widow of\r\nLord Dalmeny, son of the Earl of Rosebery, by whom, however, he has\r\nno issue, so that at his decease—his brothers, the second and third\r\ndukes, having also died without issue—the titles, with the exception\r\nof that of Baron Barnard, will become extinct. The heir to the barony\r\nof Barnard is Morgan Vane, Esq. (only son of the late Rev. Robert\r\nMorgan Vane), great-grandson of the Hon. Morgan Vane, brother of Henry,\r\nthird Baron Barnard, who, as we have shown, was created Viscount\r\nBarnard and Earl of Darlington. This Robert Morgan Vane married, as\r\nhis first wife, Margaretta, daughter of Robert Knight, and ultimately\r\nheiress to Robert, Earl of Catherlough, from which marriage the present\r\nheir-presumptive is descended.\r\n\r\nThe arms of Vane are (as already explained, from the circumstance of\r\none of the family taking the French king prisoner at the battle of\r\nPoitiers)—_azure_, three dexter gauntlets, _or_. These were borne\r\nby the Duke of Cleveland quarterly with those of Fitzroy, being the\r\nroyal arms of King Charles II., viz.—one and four France and England\r\nquarterly, two Ireland, three Scotland; the whole debruised by a baton\r\nsinister, componé of six pieces, _ermine_ and _azure_, the supporters\r\nbeing dexter, a lion guardant, _or_, ducally crowned with a ducal\r\ncoronet, _azure_, gorged with a collar counter-componé, _ermine_ and\r\n_azure_; sinister, a greyhound, _argent_, gorged with a collar,\r\ncounter-componé, _ermine_ and _azure_, being the supporters of Fitzroy,\r\nDuke of Cleveland, granted to Vane on being advanced to the marquisate\r\nin 1827. Crests: Vane—a dexter arm in a gauntlet grasping a dagger;\r\nFitzroy—on a chapeau, _gules_, turned up, _ermine_, a lion passant\r\nguardant, _or_, crowned with a ducal coronet, _argent_, and gorged with\r\na collar, counter-componé, _ermine_ and _azure_. Motto—“Nec temere,\r\nnec timide.” On the assumption of the name and arms of Powlett, the\r\narms, as now borne by the Duke of Cleveland, are—_sable_, three swords\r\nin pile, points downwards, _proper_, pomels and hilts, _or_. Crest,\r\non a wreath, a falcon rising, _or_, belled of the last, and ducally\r\ncrowned, _gules_. Supporters and motto as before. The arms of the Earl\r\nof Catherlough, which the heir-presumptive is entitled to quarter with\r\nhis own of Vane, are—_argent_, three bendlets, _gules_; on a canton,\r\n_azure_, a spur with the rowel downwards, strapped, _or_. Crest, on a\r\nwreath, _argent_ and _gules_, a spur, _or_, between two wings erect,\r\n_gules_. Motto—“Te digna sequere.”\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Cleveland is patron of twenty-four livings, thirteen of\r\nwhich are in Shropshire, one in Northamptonshire, two in Durham, two\r\nin Somersetshire, one in Yorkshire, two in Devonshire, two in Dorset,\r\nand one in Cornwall. His principal seats are Raby Castle, Durham, and\r\nBattle Abbey, Sussex.\r\n\r\nThe present castle of Raby, it would appear, was built by John, Lord\r\nNevil, who died in 1388. In 1379 he had license from Thomas Hatfield,\r\nBishop of Durham, to crenellate. Whether the old castle was mainly\r\npulled down and rebuilt by John Nevil, or whether he simply added to\r\nit fresh towers and fortifications, is a matter we have not space, nor\r\nis it necessary to our purpose, to inquire into. That it could not all\r\nhave been taken down is, however, pretty evident, as the lozenge-shaped\r\ntower in the centre is said to have been built by Bertram de Bulmer,\r\nor Bolemes, in 1162. The Nevils, who were at the same time Lords of\r\nRaby, Brancepath, Sheriff-Hutton, and Middleham, were all described as\r\n“Dominus de Raby;” and thus it is evident that Raby was their chief\r\nresidence and stronghold.\r\n\r\nRaby, says the Rev. Mr. Hodgson (who has done more than any other\r\nantiquary in searching into and elucidating the history of this grand\r\nold pile, and to whom we express our deep obligation for much of the\r\ncritical description of the building we are about to give), in its\r\npresent state (although some parts of the older edifice were left and\r\nincorporated in it) “presents essentially the work and ideas of one\r\nperiod,” the fourteenth century. Leland speaks of it as “the largest\r\ncastell of logginges in al the north cuntrey, and is of a strong\r\nbuilding, but not set other on the hill or very strong ground;” but he\r\ndoes not mention the moat, which was probably filled up and the water\r\ndrawn off before his time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _East Side._]\r\n\r\nThe general arrangement of the castle is as follows:—First, the\r\ncentral nucleus, or castle proper, consisting of a compact mass of\r\ntowers connected by short curtains, and of which the block shape may be\r\ndescribed as something between a right-angled triangle and a square,\r\nhaving the right angle to the south-west. Next, a spacious platform\r\nentirely surrounding this central mass; then a low embattled wall of\r\nenceinte, strengthened by a moat-house, and perhaps a barbican, as\r\nwell as by numerous small square bastions rising from its exterior\r\nbase; and then the moat. The south front of the castle being so\r\namply defended by water, its structural defences were naturally less\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Raby Castle, from the West._]\r\n\r\nQuite unlike the others, it was, with the exception of the flanking\r\ntowers at either end, nearly flat. The first, or western of these,\r\ncalled the Duke’s Tower, is very large and square, and of different\r\nheights, being, in fact, two towers laid together. Considerably in\r\nrecess, a rather low curtain connected it with the end of the Great\r\nHall, which, till lately, rose up tower-like, but without projection.\r\nBeyond, and nearly in a line, came another curtain, short, but lofty;\r\nand then the wedge-like projection of Bulmer’s Tower, which flanked the\r\nwhole towards the east. This tower, which commemorates Bertram Bulmer,\r\none of the Saxon ancestors of the Nevils, by two raised B’s in its\r\nupper story, being of somewhat unusual shape, viz. a pentagon, formed\r\nby the application of an equilateral triangle to a square, has given\r\nrise to comments and conjectures of the wildest sort. An underground\r\npassage, there is little or no doubt, extends from the substructure of\r\nthis tower to a small blocked-up doorway in one of the bastions of the\r\nwall of enceinte above the lake, from which, again, there is reason to\r\nthink, another traverses its whole length westwards. Passing onwards,\r\nwe come to the east or north-east front. This is a very fine work,\r\nextremely bold and vigorous, set thick with towers, and broken by deep\r\nre-entering angles into immense masses. Thoroughly fortress-like and\r\nutilitarian in its character, without the least pretence to ornament,\r\nit is a masterpiece no less of artistic than constructive skill.\r\nBeginning at the south-east angle, we have, in the first place, the\r\ngreat pentagon of Bulmer’s Tower, and the short curtain spoken of\r\nas connecting it with the Hall, standing out transept-wise from the\r\nlatter, and defending it to the east.\r\n\r\nA little farther on, and about midway in its length, the Chapel, with\r\nits substructure terminating in a lofty tower, performs the same\r\nservice. Projecting from the lower part of this tower, until destroyed\r\nin modern times, was an advanced portal, the exact nature of which\r\ncannot be particularised. Again, at about an equal distance, a third\r\ntranseptal mass, terminating in a tower called Mount Raskelf, stands\r\nout from and protects the Hall. A short high curtain, extending between\r\nthe Chapel Tower and this last, forms at the same time the limit of a\r\nsmall court-yard and a screen to that portion of the Hall which lies\r\nbehind it. Mount Raskelf is the angle tower between what are, strictly\r\nspeaking, the east and north fronts. Its northern face and curtain fall\r\nback deeply till they join the great square of the Kitchen Tower, which\r\nprojects at right angles, and is connected by a strong machicolated\r\ncurtain to the east fabric of Clifford’s Tower, by far the largest\r\nin the castle, and of immense strength. This tower is planned with\r\nconsummate skill. In shape an oblong square, standing almost detached,\r\nand set diagonally to the north and west fronts, it not only completely\r\nflanks them both, but also, from its close proximity to the Moat-house,\r\ncould either lend it effectual aid in case of an assault, or render\r\nit, if captured, utterly untenable. Turning the angle of Clifford’s\r\nTower, we gain the west front. A strong machicolated curtain, bending\r\nslightly westward, connects it with a lofty tower of slight projection,\r\nand separated by a short wall space from the well-advanced and\r\ndiagonally set turrets of the great Gatehouse. A deep recess in the\r\nelevation intervenes between the latter and our starting-point, the\r\nDuke’s Tower, which stands well out again, and terminates the whole.\r\nPassing under the long vault of the great Gatehouse, we reach the\r\nCourt-yard. Lofty walls close it in on all sides with very picturesque\r\nand fine effect, the Great Hall lying to the east. A central tower of\r\nbeautiful proportion, which stands out at right angles to it, shuts\r\noff a smaller court-yard to the north. There are many points about the\r\nexterior which require careful examination. First as to detail. What\r\nmay be considered the typical form of window is very characteristic\r\nand peculiar—a single square-topped light, with a rounded trefoil\r\nin the head, the eye of which is either sunk or pierced. It is very\r\ndomestic, and has an excellent effect. In Clifford’s Tower they\r\nare superimposed. The windows of the Chapel, which, though good in\r\nthemselves, are of an ordinary form, square-headed, with net tracery,\r\nraise an important and interesting question, viz. What is their\r\nprobable date, and can we possibly assign them to what may fairly\r\nbe called the time of the builder of the great Gatehouse? Now the\r\nChapel, which is unquestionably the earliest part of the castle, and\r\nthoroughly fortress-like in character, determines by its date the\r\nperiod when the general work of reconstruction and fortifying began. In\r\nthe Moat Tower, above segmental, circular, and depressed four-centred\r\narches, we have on the summit concave, shoulder-arched doorways of\r\nwonderfully pure and early-looking character. The side-windows of the\r\nGreat Hall, again—pairs of long lancets set closely together, and\r\nwithout hood-moulds—though Transition or Early Perpendicular in date,\r\nare almost Early English in composition. We need feel no very great\r\nsurprise, therefore, if in the Chapel we find a type adopted which\r\nwas generally expiring. An examination of the masonry on either hand\r\nof the great Gate Tower will show that an extensive alteration was\r\nmade in that part of the castle. It would seem that the face of the\r\noriginal Gatehouse, which probably stood midway between the back and\r\nfront of the present one, just about where the inner doorway spans\r\nthe passage, was taken down, and the whole structure brought forward\r\nas we see it. The roof proves this almost to demonstration. Within\r\nthe central archway, towards the Court-yard, it is a simple barrel\r\nvault, strengthened with plain chamfered ribs. Without it, where\r\nthe passage-way widens, it is a well-moulded, beautiful lierne, the\r\nribs producing, perhaps intentionally, the Nevil saltire four times\r\nrepeated. At the same time the short curtain which connected the old\r\nGatehouse with the tower to the north was advanced level with the\r\nface of the latter, and the western half of the Duke’s Tower, already\r\ndescribed as a double one, added, so as to flank the front, which now,\r\ninstead of having a salient angle in the centre, as at first, was,\r\nso to say, made square. The outer entrance of the Gatehouse is very\r\nfine. Its boldly moulded four-centred arch is surmounted by a second\r\nof the same contour, but richly cusped and trefoiled. Above it are\r\nthree shields, each surrounded with the garter. They are—1st, Nevil;\r\n2nd, St. George; 3rd, Latimer; and fix certainly the erection of this\r\nGatehouse, though it looks so much later, between 1382—the probable\r\ndate of John Nevil’s second marriage with Elizabeth Latimer—and his\r\ndeath in 1389.\r\n\r\nAnother most noticeable point about the work is the entire absence of\r\nbuttresses. Every tower and curtain stands in its own unaided strength.\r\nThe great diversities of design, especially as seen in the towers,\r\nshould also be noticed. Without the least approach to affectation or\r\nextravagance in any, yet of all the nine included in the central group\r\nthere are no two which bear the faintest resemblance to each other—the\r\nvariety and beauty of proportion in its parts, and the admirable way\r\nin which they are combined, producing, as they did once, a sky-line\r\nperhaps unmatched in England, are really the glories of the castle. A\r\nperfect simplicity and directness of purpose, with infinite change and\r\nplay of line, characterize the building throughout, and stamp it as the\r\nwork of a master.\r\n\r\nModern alterations have so obscured and destroyed John Nevil’s work in\r\nthe interior that there is little of it left to see. Still there is\r\nsomething. Leland, who mentions it, says, “The Haul and al the Houses\r\nof Offices be large and stately. The Great Chaumber was exceeding\r\nlarge, but now it is fals rofid and divided into two or three partes.”\r\nNow if by the “Haul” and “Great Chaumber” he refers to the same\r\nthing, which internal evidence seems to show he must, then the worthy\r\nitinerant was entirely mistaken. “A recent investigation, accompanied\r\nby a vigorous use of the pick, has shown me,” says Mr. Hodgson, “that\r\nthe Hall, as its external appearance indicates, was always, from\r\nthe very first, a double one, consisting, that is, of two halls of\r\nnearly equal height, one above the other. About ten feet below the\r\npresent floor I came upon the line of the old one, which had been of\r\nwood carried on pillars (whence, perhaps, the mistake of being ‘fals\r\nrofid’), the mutilated remains of the great fire-place, and three\r\ndoorways, all of which I partially opened out. The upper, or Baron’s\r\nHall, called so, perhaps, to distinguish it from the lower, was a noble\r\nroom. Ranges of long narrow transomed windows lighted it on each side,\r\nas well as two large traceried ones of three lights to the south, and\r\nanother to the north. The roof, a very fine one of oak, was carried\r\non cambered beams, each displaying the saltire on its centre. These\r\nwere the ordinary arrangements. Extending the full width of the north\r\nend was a lofty stone music gallery, with arch cornice. In advance\r\nof it the screens, behind which, and leading to the Kitchen, Pantry,\r\nand Buttery, were once most likely the usual three doorways, but of\r\nthese, owing to mutilations, I could only find one. At either end of\r\nthe passage was a large arched doorway. One of these opened upon a\r\nstaircase close to the Chapel door, the other upon the roof of a sort\r\nof cloister in the Great Court, which must have formed a promenade, and\r\nof which also I have found the traces. Platforms of this sort, carried\r\non arches, and occupying an exactly similar position, occur in the\r\ncastles of Coucy and Creil.”\r\n\r\nThe Kitchen, though it has a certain air of rudeness, and has lost its\r\nancient fire-place, is still a very interesting relic, and one of the\r\nmost perfect things in the castle. It occupies the whole interior of a\r\nlarge strong square tower. The windows, which have stepped sills, are\r\nset high up in the walls, and are connected by a perforated passage\r\nof defence provided with garde-robes, which runs all round. Two pairs\r\nof very strong vaulting ribs, intersecting in the centre, carry the\r\nlouvre, which is of stone and of immense size. The lower part, twelve\r\nfeet square, rises to upwards of the same height above the leads, and\r\nis surmounted by an octagon fifteen feet higher still. Externally it\r\nforms a very striking and effective feature. Below the Kitchen a cellar\r\nof the same shape and size has a well-groined vaulted roof carried\r\non a central pillar. Another to the east, which has a large double\r\nfire-place at one end, has a strongly ribbed circular segmental vault.\r\nAll the first-floor chambers of the west front, including Clifford’s\r\nTower, have plain barrel vaults. The lower chamber of Bulmer’s Tower\r\nhad till lately a richly groined vault of great strength and beauty.\r\nThe Hall Tower has both its lower stories vaulted; the first ribbed,\r\nthe second plain. The whole of this tower, inside and out, has been\r\nwonderfully preserved. Vaults, windows, grilles, doorways, stairs,\r\ngarde-robes, all are nearly intact, and will bear careful examination.\r\nIt is really the most perfect thing in the place. The Chapel, all\r\nmutilated as it is, still deserves notice. The Sanctuary, which forms\r\nthe central portion of a tower, has a boldly ribbed quadripartite\r\nvault. Above it is a guard-chamber. Its exterior window, above the\r\neastern one of the Chapel, is marked by a very remarkable little\r\nhanging machicoulis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Raby Castle, West Side._]\r\n\r\nThe entrance to Raby is by the Porter’s Lodge in the north-west portion\r\nof the embattled outer wall. In this Lodge are found some family\r\nrelics; among others, the sword worn by Lord Barnard, son of the first\r\nEarl of Darlington, at the battle of Fontenoy, where a bullet, striking\r\nhis sword, broke it, and then, glancing off, disabled its wearer. The\r\nGateway is flanked by two towers, each of which is surmounted by a\r\nfigure of a mail clad warrior.\r\n\r\nThe main entrance to the castle itself is on the west side, between\r\ntwo towers. It is a long passage, with groined roof and traces of\r\nportcullis; and carriages drive through this passage into the\r\nQuadrangle, or Court-yard. Crossing this, and facing the main entrance\r\njust alluded to, is the enormous doorway opening into the Great or\r\nEntrance Hall. Through this doorway the carriages literally drive into\r\nthe mansion, and there set down the guests in the Hall itself, which\r\nis of great size, with an arched roof, supported by eight octagonal\r\npillars in its centre. “When the brilliant gas above combines its glare\r\nwith that of two enormous fires, and the roof is echoing to the tramp\r\nof horses and the roll of wheels, the visitor cannot but be struck\r\nwith the unusual entrance,” says a recent writer. In this Hall is hung\r\nTurner’s famous picture of Raby Castle.\r\n\r\nAbove this Great Hall is the famous Baron’s Hall immortalised by\r\nWordsworth, where\r\n\r\n  “Seven hundred knights, retainers all\r\n  Of Neville, at the muster’s call,\r\n  Had sate together in Raby’s hall.”\r\n\r\nThis Hall, which is 126 feet long by 36 feet broad, is ceiled with\r\noak and contains a large number of family portraits; also “Interior\r\nof an Artist’s Studio,” by Teniers, and portraits of Queen Elizabeth,\r\nCromwell, James II., and Frederick, Prince of Wales. The south end\r\nof the room is modern, being built over the Octagon Drawing-room. A\r\nstaircase leads from the Baron’s Hall to the Chapel, renovated by the\r\nsecond duke. Some of the windows are filled with stained glass by\r\nWailes; others with old German glass. The Chapel contains Murillo’s\r\n“St. Catherine” and “The Saviour bearing the Cross.”\r\n\r\nIn most of the apartments of the castle are many fine pictures,\r\nportraits and others, among which are the Duke of Cleveland, son of\r\nCharles II.; Barbara Villiers, Duchess of Cleveland; Lady Barnard, wife\r\nof Christopher, Lord Barnard; Harry, second Duke of Cleveland, in his\r\nGarter robes; and the first Duke of Cleveland in his uniform as Colonel\r\nof the Durham Militia. The Octagon Drawing-room, built by the second\r\nduke, is, in all its details, a most elaborate and highly finished\r\napartment. The furniture is elegant. In this room is Hiram Powers’\r\ncelebrated statue of the “Greek Slave,” purchased by the second Duke of\r\nCleveland for £1,800.\r\n\r\nThe Kitchen is a fine specimen of mediæval architecture, and is\r\nevidence of the lavish hospitality of a former age. “The enormous oven\r\nwould have baked bread for an army, and is described by Pennant as\r\nbeing, in his time, used as a wine-cellar, ‘the sides being divided\r\ninto two parts, and each part holding a hogshead of wine in bottles.’”\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary for us to enter further into the details of the\r\ninterior arrangements of the castle. All we need say is, that the rooms\r\nare fitted and furnished with all the appliances of Art which might be\r\nexpected in the home of so enlightened and so liberal-minded a nobleman\r\nas his Grace the Duke of Cleveland.\r\n\r\nStaindrop, closely adjoining Raby Park, is an interesting town, whose\r\nChurch contains many monuments to members of the noble families of\r\nNevil and Vane. The Church was restored in 1849. Among the monuments,\r\nperhaps the most interesting are an altar-tomb, with recumbent\r\neffigies, to Ralph Nevil, Earl of Westmoreland, and his two wives,\r\nMargaret, daughter to Hugh, Earl of Stafford, and Joan, daughter to\r\nJohn of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster; and a monument in wood, with effigies\r\nof Henry, fifth Earl of Westmoreland (1564), and his two wives. There\r\nis also a magnificent white marble altar-tomb to the first Duke of\r\nCleveland, by Westmacott, the recumbent figure on which is beautifully\r\nexecuted. In the chancel there is a monument, of exquisite design, in\r\nthe purest white marble, in memory of Sophia, Duchess of Cleveland\r\n(wife of the second duke), who died in 1859. Within the altar-rails are\r\nother monuments, including those of Henry, second Earl of Darlington,\r\nwho died in 1792; Margaret, Countess of Darlington, who died in 1800;\r\nand Katharine Margaret, Countess of Darlington, who died in 1807. There\r\nare also stained-glass windows in memory of Henry, second Duke of\r\nCleveland; one erected by the friends and tenants of the Duke, and the\r\nother by Lady Augusta Powlett, his sister-in-law. A monumental brass of\r\nchaste design, on the north side of the Church, preserves the memory of\r\nWilliam, third Duke of Cleveland. North of the Church is a Mausoleum,\r\nerected by the second Duke of Cleveland, in which the remains of the\r\nDuke and other members of the family repose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLIEFDEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR notice of “charming Cliefden” must necessarily be brief; not\r\nbecause the “Stately Home” itself lacks of stateliness, of beauty, of\r\ngrandeur, or of interest; not because the episodes in its history are\r\n“few and far between,” or devoid of incident; not because its glorious\r\nsituation and its picturesque surroundings present few features for the\r\npen to dwell upon, and the poetic or artistic mind to linger over; and\r\nnot because the genealogies of the families to which it has belonged\r\nwill not vie both in point of antiquity, in fame, and in noble and\r\nillustrious actions with others; but simply because the space at our\r\ndisposal will admit only of words where we would gladly have written\r\nparagraphs. In interest, in beauty, and picturesque surroundings,\r\nCliefden will bear favourable comparison with most others of our\r\nseries, while it yields to none in the loveliness, the romantic beauty,\r\nand the attractiveness of its situation. To take only a cursory glance\r\nat such a place is like peeping in at the door of a picture gallery,\r\nwithout having time to note any of the treasures spread on its walls.\r\n\r\nCliefden, now one of the seats of his Grace the Duke of Westminster,\r\nis situated in Buckinghamshire, and overlooks the river Thames in its\r\nmost attractive part. It is to Cliefden that the river here owes its\r\nchief loveliness, but it is also to the river that Cliefden is indebted\r\nfor one of its principal attractions. From the Berkshire side of the\r\nThames the woods and the mansion form a magnificent scene, but it is\r\nfrom the bosom of the stream that its beauties are best understood\r\nand most enjoyed. “Cliefden runs along the summit of a lofty ridge\r\nwhich overhangs the river. The outline of this ridge is broken in the\r\nmost agreeable way; the steep bank is covered with luxuriant foliage,\r\nforming a hanging wood of great beauty, or in parts bare, so as to\r\nincrease the gracefulness of the foliage by the contrast; and the whole\r\nbank has run into easy-flowing curves at the bidding of the noble\r\nstream which washes its base. A few islands deck this part of the\r\nriver, and occasionally little tongues of land run out into it, or a\r\ntree overhangs it, helping to give vigour to the foreground of the rich\r\nlandscape. From the summit the views are really magnificent; both up\r\nand down the river they are of surpassing beauty. Looking over Windsor,\r\nthe eye ranges far away till it loses itself in the hazy distance, to\r\nwhich the royal pile gives an aërial grace, while it adds majesty to\r\nthe whole view. Looking up the river towards Hedsor the charming seat\r\nof Lord Boston, we have a prospect little less splendid, though of\r\na different character. A vast extent of country lies at one’s feet,\r\ncovered with dense wooded tracts, from which ever and anon peeps up an\r\nold grey tower; and the blue smoke marks a secluded village, while the\r\nglorious river winds away like a broad stream of molten silver.” The\r\nimmediate grounds, whether Thamesward or landward, are well laid out,\r\nand present at every turn spots of beauty and loveliness not excelled\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cliefden._]\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the river scenery about Cliefden, Mr. Hall, in his “Book\r\nof the Thames,” says, “Those who accuse our great island river of\r\ninsipidity, who, if they concede its claims to beauty, deny its\r\npretensions to grandeur, will do well to row beneath the thick\r\nwoods of Taplow and Cliefden, and, looking up, they will have no\r\ndifficulty in imagining themselves in one of the grandest and richest,\r\nin picturesque attractions, of our English lakes; indeed, they will\r\nrequire only the near and distant mountains to fancy themselves under\r\nthe heights of Glena, in all-beautiful Killarney. Well may we rejoice\r\nto scan the charms of our glorious river, and ask the aid of Poetry\r\nand Art to give them fame and power. But the painter will fail here.\r\nHe may select graceful nooks, and a thousand objects will, singly or\r\nin groups, present themselves as fitting subjects for his pencil;\r\nbut he cannot convey to the eye and mind a just idea of the mingled\r\ngrandeur and beauty of this delicious locality; while the poet will\r\nfind only themes which have been, ever and everywhere, the chosen and\r\nthe favoured of his order. Those who row past these charming woods,\r\nand note what has been done by taste, in association with wealth, to\r\nrender every part delightful, ascend any of the heights and examine the\r\n‘prospect,’ near or distant, their enjoyment will be largely enhanced.\r\nIt is impossible, indeed, to exaggerate the beauty and harmony of the\r\nfoliage which everywhere surrounds us:—\r\n\r\n  ‘Beautiful in various dyes,\r\n  The gloomy pine, the poplar blue,\r\n  The yellow beech, the sable yew,\r\n  The slender fir that taper grows.\r\n  The sturdy oak with broad-spread boughs;\r\n  And, beyond., the purple grove.\r\n  Haunt of Phyllis—Queen of Love!’\r\n\r\nBut there are here hundreds of other trees which the poet could\r\nnot commemorate, for they were unknown in England in his time. All\r\nclimes and countries have contributed to the wealth of foliage at\r\nCliefden—woods, lawns, and gardens are enriched by tributes from\r\nevery land to which enterprise has conducted British science to gather\r\ntreasures converted from exotics into subjects naturalised and ‘at\r\nhome.’”\r\n\r\nCliefden formerly belonged to the ancient family of Manfeld, of\r\nBuckinghamshire, from whom it was purchased by the infamously\r\nprofligate George Villiers, second Duke of Buckingham, who built the\r\nmansion, and expended large sums of money in laying out the grounds and\r\nplanting them with all the rarities of arboriculture he could procure.\r\nHe employed Archer, the architect, to design and erect the mansion, and\r\nto adorn the grounds with alcoves and other buildings of a like nature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Thames at Cliefden._]\r\n\r\nThe house was a commanding square structure, of three stories in\r\nheight, besides the terrace (440 feet long), and it had wings connected\r\nwith the main building by a colonnade. It was built of red brick, with\r\nstone dressings. He furnished it in a sumptuous manner, and hung its\r\nwalls with fine tapestry and valuable pictures. Here the Duke brought\r\nhis mistress, the Countess of Shrewsbury, and here gave full bent to\r\nhis licentious habits. Thus Cliefden gained an unenviable notoriety,\r\nand has been immortalised in song and in prose:—\r\n\r\n  “Gallant and gay, in Cliefden’s proud alcove,\r\n  The bower of wanton Shrewsbury and love.”\r\n\r\nIn 1667-8 the Duke had taken part in a singular triple duel about the\r\nCountess, and had mortally wounded her husband by running him through\r\nthe body. Pepys thus wrote of this duel:—“January 17th. Much discourse\r\nof the duell yesterday between the Duke of Buckingham, Holmes, and\r\none Jenkins, on one side, and my Lord of Shrewsbury, Sir John Talbot,\r\nand one Bernard Howard, on the other side: and all about my Lady\r\nShrewsbury, who is at this time, and hath for a great while been, a\r\nmistress to the Duke of Buckingham. And so her husband challenged him,\r\nand they met yesterday in a close near Barne-Elmes, and there fought:\r\nand my Lord Shrewsbury is run through the body, from the right breast\r\nthrough the shoulder; and Sir John Talbot all along up one of his\r\narmes; and Jenkins killed upon the place, and the rest all in a little\r\nmeasure wounded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cliefden: the Cottage._]\r\n\r\nThis will make the world think that the King hath good counsellors\r\nabout him, when the Duke of Buckingham, the greatest man about him,\r\nis a fellow of no more sobriety than to fight about a mistress. And\r\nthis may prove a very bad accident to the Duke of Buckingham, but that\r\nmy Lady Castlemaine do rule all at this time as much as ever she did,\r\nand she will, it is believed, keep all matters well with the Duke of\r\nBuckingham; though this is a time that the King will be very backward,\r\nI suppose, to appear in such a business. And it is pretty to hear how\r\nthe King had some notice of this challenge a week or two ago, and did\r\ngive it to my Lord Generall to confine the Duke, or take security that\r\nhe should not do any such thing as fight: and the Generall trusted to\r\nthe King that he, sending for him, would do it; and the King trusted\r\nto the Generall. And it is said that my Lord Shrewsbury’s case is to\r\nbe feared that he may die too: and that may make it much worse for the\r\nDuke of Buckingham: and I shall not be much sorry for it, that we may\r\nhave some sober man come in his room to assist in the Government.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cliefden: the Summer Cottage._]\r\n\r\nThe Countess of Shrewsbury (the Duke’s mistress), who was Anna Maria,\r\ndaughter of Robert, Earl of Cardigan, is said to have held the Duke’s\r\nhorse, habited as a page, while the duel was being fought, and that\r\nshe thus not only saw her husband mortally wounded, but then went\r\nhome with the murderer, where she took him to her arms “in the shirt\r\ncovered with her husband’s blood.” The Duke was married to the Hon.\r\nMary Fairfax, daughter and heiress of Lord Fairfax, the Parliamentary\r\ngeneral—a woman of pure tastes and faultless habits—whom he\r\nshamefully neglected. Pepys, under date the 15th of May, 1668, says, “I\r\nam told also that the Countesse of Shrewsbury is brought home by the\r\nDuke [the Earl had died of his wounds in March] of Buckingham to his\r\nhouse, where his Duchesse, saying that it was not for her and the other\r\nto live together in a house, he answered, ‘_Why, madam, I did think so,\r\nand therefore have ordered your coach to be ready to carry you to your\r\nfather’s_;’ which was a devilish speech, but, they say, true; and my\r\nLady Shrewsbury is there, it seems.”\r\n\r\nLarge as was the income of the Duke, his profligacy, extravagance, and\r\nimmoralities so swallowed it up that he did not complete Cliefden, and\r\ndied in wretchedness; and but for the timely help of Lord Arran, a\r\nfew days before his decease, in abject poverty and loneliness. “There\r\nis not,” wrote Lord Arran, “so much as one farthing towards defraying\r\nthe least expense;” and Pope, in one of his epistles to Lord Bathurst,\r\nremarks—\r\n\r\n  “Behold! what blessings wealth to life can lend,\r\n  And see what comforts it affords our end!\r\n  In the worst inn’s worst room, with mat half-hung,\r\n  The floors of plaster, and the walls of dung,\r\n  On once a flock bed, but repaired with straw,\r\n  With tape-tied curtains, never meant to draw,\r\n  The George and Garter dangling from that bed,\r\n  Where tawdry yellow strove with dirty red,\r\n  Great Villiers lies—alas! how changed from him,\r\n  That life of pleasure, and that soul of whim,\r\n  Gallant and gay in Cliefden’s proud alcove,\r\n  Tho bower of wanton Shrewsbury and love;\r\n  Or just as gay at council in a ring\r\n  Of mimick’d statesmen and their merry king.\r\n  No wit to flatter, left off all his store;\r\n  No fool to laugh at, which he valued more;\r\n  There victor of his health, of fortune, friends,\r\n  And fame, this lord of useless thousands ends.”\r\n\r\nSoon after the Duke’s death all his property, being deeply mortgaged,\r\nwas sold, but did not realise enough to pay his debts; and dying\r\nwithout issue, “his titles, which had been undeservedly conferred on\r\nhis father, and only disgraced by himself, became extinct.”\r\n\r\nCliefden was purchased by Lord George Hamilton (fifth son of the Duke\r\nof Hamilton), who was created Baron Dechemont of Linlithgow, Viscount\r\nKirkwall of Orkney, and Earl of Orkney, in 1696. His lordship completed\r\nthe mansion, and did much towards beautifying the grounds. Dying\r\nwithout male issue in 1737, his eldest daughter, Anne, became Countess\r\nof Orkney, and succeeded to the Cliefden estate. She, however, did\r\nnot reside here, but let it to H.R.H. Frederick, Prince of Wales,\r\nfather of King George III., who for many years made it his summer\r\nresidence. Here, at Cliefden, on the 1st of August, 1740, was first\r\nperformed Thomson and Mallet’s masque of _Alfred_, in which occurs\r\nthe ever-famous and patriotic “ode in honour of Great Britain,” “Rule\r\nBritannia”—\r\n\r\n  “When Britain first, at Heav’n’s command,\r\n    Arose from out the azure main”—\r\n\r\nthe music of which was composed by Dr. Arne. It was, therefore, within\r\nthe walls of Cliefden that “Rule Britannia” was first heard, and this\r\ngives it a literary interest of no small note. The masque in which\r\nit formed so prominent a feature was prepared and given at Cliefden,\r\nto commemorate the accession to the throne, in 1714, of King George\r\nI. (grandfather of Frederick, Prince of Wales), and in honour of the\r\nthird birthday of his daughter, the young Princess Augusta. It was\r\nrepeated the following night, and soon became the most popular of all\r\ncompositions.\r\n\r\nIn 1795 the mansion (it is traditionally said through the carelessness\r\nof a maid-servant reading a novel in bed) was totally destroyed by\r\nfire, the wings, at some distance from the main building, being alone\r\nsaved; while nearly all the sumptuous furniture, pictures, and tapestry\r\nwere devoured by the flames. The estate was afterwards purchased by Sir\r\nGeorge Warrender, by whom the mansion, which had been left in ruins\r\nsince the fire, was rebuilt in 1830. After his death the estate was\r\nsold by Sir George’s executors to his Grace the Duke of Sutherland,\r\nand on the 15th of November, 1849 (the day of thanksgiving for the\r\ncessation of the cholera), only a few months after its purchase, it was\r\nagain burned down.\r\n\r\nIn the following year, 1850, the Duke of Sutherland set about\r\nrebuilding the mansion on a scale of princely magnificence, and having\r\nengaged the services of Barry as architect, the present pile soon rose\r\nfrom the ruins of the former buildings. The “centre portion, which is\r\na revival of the design for old Somerset House, now extends to the\r\nwings, which, together with the terrace, are made to harmonize with\r\nthe new building.” The house and grounds, like Trentham, owe much of\r\ntheir beauty and loveliness to the good taste of the Duke and Duchess,\r\nthe latter of whom, when a dowager, made it one of her favourite\r\nresidences. The interior of this “Stately Home” needs no particular\r\ndescription. The rooms are, of course, one and all sumptuously\r\nfurnished with all the appliances of wealth and taste, and are lavish\r\nin their attractions. It is truly a “home of beauty and of taste.”\r\n\r\nCliefden passed from the Duke of Sutherland to his daughter, the Lady\r\nConstance Leveson-Gower, married to the present Duke of Westminster,\r\nwhose property this splendid domain is.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Principal Front._]\r\n\r\nThe family of Grosvenor, of which the present owner of Cliefden is\r\nthe illustrious head, is one of high antiquity, tracing, as it does,\r\nin England, from the Norman conquest, when his grace’s ancestor came\r\nover with William the Conqueror. The principal line of the Grosvenors\r\nwas seated at Hulme, in the hundred of Northwich, in Cheshire, and was\r\ndescended in direct line from Gilbert le Grosvenour, nephew of Hugh\r\nLupus, the Norman Earl Palatine of Chester, whom he accompanied to this\r\ncountry. The name, it is said, was derived from _le Gros Venour_, from\r\nthe family having held the hereditary post of chief huntsman to the\r\nDukes of Normandy. This main line was extinct in the twenty-second year\r\nof the reign of Henry VI., the line being continued by Ralph Grosvenor,\r\nsecond son of Sir Thomas Grosvenor, of Hulme. He married Joan Eaton,\r\ndaughter and sole heiress of John Eaton, of Eaton, or Eton, in\r\nCheshire, Esq., early in the fifteenth century. In 1621-2 a baronetcy\r\nwas conferred on the representative of the family; and in 1676, Sir\r\nThomas Grosvenor having married Mary, sole daughter and heiress of\r\nAlexander Davies, of Ebury, in the county of Middlesex, Esq., laid the\r\nfoundation of the immense wealth and rapidly increasing honours of the\r\nGrosvenors.\r\n\r\nIn 1761 the then baronet, Sir Richard Grosvenor, was elevated to the\r\npeerage by the title of Baron Grosvenor of Eaton, in Cheshire, and\r\nin 1781 was advanced to the titles of Viscount Belgrave and Earl\r\nGrosvenor. He married Henrietta, daughter of Henry Vernon, Esq., by\r\nwhom he had issue an only son, Robert Grosvenor. The Earl died in 1802,\r\nand was succeeded by his son, Robert Grosvenor, as second earl.\r\n\r\nThis nobleman was born in 1767, and married, in 1794, the Lady Eleanor\r\nEgerton, daughter of the first Earl of Wilton, by whom he had issue his\r\nsuccessor, Lord Richard, who became third earl and second marquis; Lord\r\nThomas, who became Earl of Wilton; and Lord Robert, M.P. In 1831 Earl\r\nGrosvenor was advanced to the dignity of a marquis, by the title of\r\nMarquis of Westminster being conferred upon him. He died in 1845, and\r\nwas succeeded by his eldest son—\r\n\r\nRichard, second Marquis of Westminster and third Earl Grosvenor.\r\nHe was born in 1795, and in 1819 married the Lady Elizabeth Mary\r\nLeveson-Gower, second daughter of the first Duke of Sutherland, and by\r\nher had issue a family of four sons and nine daughters. His lordship,\r\ndying in 1869, was succeeded by his eldest son, the present peer, Hugh\r\nLupus Grosvenor, in all his titles and estates, who, in 1874, was\r\ncreated Duke of Westminster.\r\n\r\nThe present noble head of this illustrious family, his Grace, Hugh\r\nLupus, first Duke and third Marquis of Westminster, Earl Grosvenor,\r\nViscount Belgrave, Baron Grosvenor of Eaton, a Baronet, and a Knight\r\nof the Garter, was born on the 13th of October, 1825, and succeeded\r\nhis father in 1869. His grace was educated at Eton and at Balliol\r\nCollege, Oxford, and represented Chester in Parliament from 1847 to\r\n1869, when he entered the Upper House. In 1852 his grace, then Marquis\r\nof Westminster, married his cousin, the Lady Constance Leveson-Gower,\r\ndaughter of the second Duke of Sutherland, and sister of the present\r\nnoble owner of Trentham. By this union his grace has issue, living,\r\nfive sons and three daughters. These are—Victor Alexander, by courtesy\r\nMarquis of Westminster, to whom (born in 1853) her Majesty the Queen\r\nstood sponsor in person, who married, in 1874, the Lady Sibell Mary\r\nLumley, daughter of the Earl of Scarborough, by whom he has issue, and\r\nis heir to the titles and estates; Lord Arthur Hugh Grosvenor, born in\r\n1863; Lord Henry George Grosvenor, born in 1864; Lord Robert Edward\r\nGrosvenor, born in 1869; Lord Gerald Richard Grosvenor, born in 1874;\r\nthe Lady Elizabeth Harriet, born in 1856; the Lady Beatrice Constance,\r\nborn in 1858; and the Lady Margaret Evelyn, born in 1873.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Westminster is patron of eleven livings, four of which are\r\nLondon churches; and his seats are Eaton Hall, Cheshire; Cliefden,\r\nBuckinghamshire; Halkin, Flintshire; and the mansion in Upper Grosvenor\r\nStreet.\r\n\r\nThe ancient arms of the Grosvenors, settled in the famous Scrope and\r\nGrosvenor trial in the fourteenth century, were claimed to be _azure_,\r\na bend, _or_; but these were declared to belong to Scrope. Sir Richard\r\nGrosvenor then, after the trial, assumed the arms _azure_, a garb,\r\n_or_, as showing his descent from the ancient Earls of Chester. On\r\nor after the creation of the marquisate of Westminster the arms of\r\nthat city were granted as an augmentation, and ordered to be borne\r\nquarterly with those of Grosvenor. The arms now are—quarterly, first\r\nand fourth, _azure_, a portcullis with chains pendent, _or_; on a chief\r\nof the last, in pale, the arms of King Edward the Confessor, between\r\ntwo united roses of York and Lancaster (being the arms of the city of\r\nWestminster); second and third, _azure_, a garb, _or_, for Grosvenor.\r\nCrest—a talbot statant, _or_. Supporters—two talbots reguardant,\r\n_or_, collared, _azure_. Motto—“Virtus non stemma.”\r\n\r\nThe glorious grounds of Cliefden have been pleasantly discoursed upon\r\nby many writers, but by none more graphically or technically than in\r\na brief notice in the _Garden_, which to some extent we cannot do\r\nbetter than quote. Cliefden, “the birthplace of spring gardening,” he\r\nsays, “well maintains the high character it has so long and deservedly\r\nreceived for the beauty of its early flowers, its banks full of wild\r\nhyacinths, primroses, and forget-me-nots; its closely shaven lawns\r\nso overspread with wild thyme that every footstep brushes up its\r\nfragrance; and, above all, its flower-beds brimful of spring beauty,\r\nwhich in turn give place to summer bedding plants. Looking from the\r\nterrace on the lawn, a huge sunken panel with flower-beds proportionate\r\nin size on either side of it, the floral display when we saw it was\r\nmagnificent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Summer House._]\r\n\r\nBrilliant pink, supplied by a large circle of _Silene pendula\r\ncompacta_, set in emerald green, was conspicuous in the distance;\r\nnearer were lavender and blue, furnished by _Nepeta cærulea_ and\r\nforget-me-nots; buff, by _Limnanthes Douglasi_; golden yellow, by\r\n_Lasthenia Californica_; and crimson, by the old China rose of that\r\ncolour and rhododendrons. Other colours, too, were equally striking,\r\nand these only a secondary display, that earlier and brighter being\r\nmade by early tulips. The plan is, when the tulips are planted, to\r\ncover the surface of the beds with annuals, sown in July and August,\r\nand transplanted when the bulbs are put in. These commence flowering\r\nwhen the tulips are over, and remain in beauty until the bedding plants\r\nare planted out. Vasefuls of Tom Thumb pelargoniums stand on the\r\ngrass near the walk at the base of the terrace wall, close to which\r\nis a ribbon border bright with pansies, for which Cliefden is justly\r\ncelebrated; and right and left are gardens of early flowers, arranged\r\non the one hand in the form of a huge shell, and on the other in beds\r\non the grass that have been bright all the season with spring flowers\r\nin great beauty. But, brilliant as the floral display on the dressed\r\nground undoubtedly has been, and soon will be again, it cannot arrest\r\nattention long. The eye is naturally carried beyond it to the wood-clad\r\nhills and dales, the rich meadows, and the river Thames, at this season\r\nalive with water-parties from Maidenhead and pleasure-boats of every\r\ndescription. These form the foreground, as it were, to a landscape\r\nunmatched for picturesque beauty, its distant boundary being the Surrey\r\nhills on the one hand, and the Chilterns, in Buckinghamshire, on the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n“Vistas, too, have been cut here and there through the trees, so as\r\nto bring into view the water or some more distant object of interest.\r\nBy reclaiming pieces of land here and there from the river, a wide\r\nand agreeable promenade has been formed along its bank, overhung at\r\nintervals by stately trees, consisting of beech, ash, and elm, with\r\nhere and there a tulip-tree and scarlet chestnut. This is reached\r\nfrom the plateau above, on which the mansion stands, by means of\r\nwinding walks and flights of rustic steps, through what may be\r\ntermed a gigantic wild garden, consisting of ancient yews, whose\r\nhold on mother earth is but small, their roots—weather-beaten and\r\nweird-looking—being half out of the ground, and tangled brushwood,\r\nfantastically overrun in places with honeysuckle and traveller’s\r\njoy. Here, too, even on the chalk, are masses of ferns, and nearer\r\nthe river-side a very fine Judas-tree, clumps of pampas grass,\r\nmulberry-coloured hazels, and other flowering and fine-leaved subjects,\r\nwhile in spring every open space is a garden of wild flowers.\r\n\r\n“Let us now return to the entrance front of the mansion. This has been\r\nstrikingly improved, by removing the old kitchen garden, and laying\r\nits site down in grass as level as a bowling-green, cut off from its\r\nsurroundings right and left by newly built walls, and in front by a\r\nthick yew hedge, still kept in vigour by means of good root treatment.\r\nThese, with the mansion, enclose a spacious quadrangle, on the side\r\nof which farthest from the windows are large vases; these in early\r\nspring are gay with tulips, and later in the season with annuals, the\r\nmost effective of which is _Silene pendula compacta_ in masses of rosy\r\nblossoms. On the walls, which are covered with climbing and other wall\r\nplants, are rare roses, and honeysuckles in profusion. In another part\r\nis a rose hedge, consisting of Fellenberg, a kind not very full when\r\nopen, but excellent in the bud state for table decoration.\r\n\r\n“Shut out from view of the mansion by these walls are the glasshouses,\r\na conservatory being on the one side, and the forcing-houses on the\r\nother—all new, and arranged with consummate skill and forethought,\r\nas regards saving of labour: the whole, with the exception of the\r\nconservatory, are built in parallel lines right and left of a central\r\npathway, under which are the hot-water pipes, a glass-covered corridor\r\nrunning round the whole, and binding them, as it were, together. Close\r\nto them are the offices and young men’s rooms, the latter built in a\r\nstyle and furnished with appliances such as are to be found in but few\r\ngardens. Grapes, peaches, and other tender fruits are grown here in\r\nperfection, and among other things we noticed a houseful of tree, or\r\nperpetual, carnations in flower, a brilliant sight—the blooms being\r\nabundant, large, and fragrant. The extension system of vine-growing\r\nis that which is most in favour here. In one vinery—an old one,\r\nsixty feet long—one vine has been allowed to fill the house; it is\r\nin excellent condition, and is carrying some two hundred bunches of\r\npromising fruit. Near here, too, is a glass corridor, the roof of which\r\nis covered with an aged fuchsia of the corallina kind; several other\r\nvarieties have been grafted on it, all of which are literally masses\r\nof flower, and most effective, owing to the contrast produced by their\r\ndifferent colours. Ivies, grown in zinc boxes and trained on trellises\r\nfor indoor screens, are here out of doors in the shade. These fit\r\ninto ornamental trays, and when taken indoors have a pelargonium or\r\nnasturtium, or some other flowering plant plunged in the box in front\r\nof them.\r\n\r\n“The conservatory is fifty-six yards in length and twelve yards in\r\nwidth, and span-roofed, the spans being placed at right angles with the\r\nwall against which it is built. It is in two divisions, but so arranged\r\nthat both can be thrown into one, which, when lighted up at night\r\n(which it is on certain occasions) has a fine effect. It is as gay as\r\na house of the kind can well be—arum lilies, as they are called, being\r\nespecially good and conspicuous. Among the more arborescent vegetation\r\nwhich it contains are oranges, carrying heavy crops of ripe fruit,\r\nand a vigorous specimen of _Abutilon Boule de Neige_, loaded with\r\ndrooping white bell-shaped flowers, which, when inverted in bouquets\r\nwith the stamens removed, have a charming effect. Against the back wall\r\nis _Lantana mutabilis_, quite a mass of variously coloured flowers,\r\nexhibiting, in fact, a luxuriance of blossom wholly unattainable by\r\nplants in pots.\r\n\r\n“With the noble entrance to Cliefden most people are familiar. It\r\nconsists of a straight avenue of dimensions commensurate with the\r\npalatial residence to which it leads. This remains as it always has\r\nbeen; but the approach in connection with it has of late been greatly\r\naltered and improved. On the one side we have natural wood intermixed\r\nwith flowering shrubs and trees; and on the other, here and there\r\nglades of grass pleasantly undulated, and furnished with clumps of\r\nrhododendrons and azaleas—some near, some distant, but all effectively\r\nplanted, and more or less over-canopied with lofty trees, chiefly\r\nbeeches, whose stems rise for an unusual height clear of branches.\r\nA large stagnant pond, by which the road passes, has been drained,\r\nfilled up, and converted into a grassy lawn, one side of which hugs\r\nthe approach for a considerable distance, while the other loses itself\r\nin the wood on the other side of the valley. Vistas, too, have been\r\njudiciously cut through the trees where the planting and views are most\r\nbeautiful, thus rendering this portion of the grounds by no means the\r\nleast interesting feature of Cliefden.\r\n\r\n“Of the kitchen garden we have said nothing; nor of the miles of green\r\ndrives, in summer shady and pleasant, with which the woods abound;\r\nnor of the indoor fruit-growing, which is excellent; but enough has\r\nbeen said to show that Cliefden, since it has become the property of\r\nthe Duke of Westminster, has been greatly improved, both as regards\r\nits buildings and its gardens, and is now one of the most charming of\r\nseats.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWARNHAM COURT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE have chosen Warnham Court to form one of our present series, not\r\nbecause it is, strictly speaking, a “_Stately_ Home,” nor because\r\nits history is a stirring one, or the family to whom it belongs can\r\nboast of high antiquity in descent, or of nobility in extraction;\r\nbut simply because it is a good and pleasing and fine example of a\r\nmodern Elizabethan home, the characteristic features of which have\r\nbeen made suitable for the tastes and requirements of the present day.\r\nIts beauties are manifold, but they are purely of that quiet domestic\r\ncharacter that is utterly opposed to ostentation and show, and that\r\ngive it an air of comfort possessed by but few of its more pretentious\r\nneighbours.\r\n\r\nSussex is a county of “many mansions,” and they are as varied in their\r\nstyle and their architectural character as they are in the periods in\r\nwhich they have been erected; but few can, out of the whole, compare\r\nwith Warnham Court in pleasantness of situation, in beauty of external\r\nsurroundings, or in comfort of internal arrangements. It is a house\r\nfitted for hospitality, and for the enjoyment of the guests its owner\r\ndelights to have around him.\r\n\r\nWarnham Court lies near the village of Warnham, which is about three\r\nmiles from Horsham, and it has a station on the Horsham line of the\r\nLondon, Brighton, and South Coast Railway. The village—and a pretty\r\nSussex village it is—consists mainly of one long street, running north\r\nand south, and it has many pleasant residences in its neighbourhood.\r\nThe Church, dedicated to St. Margaret, is of Norman foundation, but was\r\nenlarged and altered in 1848. It consists of “a nave, with north and\r\nsouth aisles, with three chancels, the north of these latter portions\r\nbeing divided from the south aisle by a fine Gothic oak screen. It\r\nhas a square embattled tower, with clock and six bells. The interior\r\ncontains several monuments” to the Carills and others.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Distant View from the Lake._]\r\n\r\nThe Court was built in the Elizabethan style, in place of an older\r\nhouse, in the beginning of this century, by Henry Tredcroft, Esq.,\r\nof Horsham—a fine old Sussex squire—and, at his death, was sold\r\nto Sir Thomas Pelley, Bart., who made it his residence. The whole\r\nestate passed, by purchase, from the executors of Sir Henry Pelley,\r\nin 1866, to its present owner, Charles T. Lucas, Esq., the head\r\nof the well-known firm of Lucas Brothers, the eminent builders\r\nand contractors. By Mr. Lucas the house has been remodelled and\r\nconsiderably enlarged, its Elizabethan character being, however,\r\ncarefully preserved in every detail. He has also built new stabling,\r\nlodges, gardener’s house, terraces, garden appliances, &c., at a very\r\nlarge outlay, which, however, has been most judiciously expended.\r\n\r\nMr. Lucas, who is the eldest son of the late James Lucas, Esq., was\r\nborn in 1820, and in 1840 was married to Miss Tiffin, by whom he\r\nhas, with other issue, a son, Charles James Lucas, born in 1853,\r\nand educated at Harrow. Mr. Lucas is Lord of the Manor of Warnham,\r\na governor of Christ’s Hospital, and a magistrate for the county of\r\nSurrey. He is brother to his partner, Thomas Lucas, Esq., of Eastwicke\r\nPark, Surrey, who was born in 1822, and in 1852 married Mary Amelia,\r\ndaughter of Robert Chamberlain, Esq., of Cotton Hall, Norfolk, by whom,\r\nwith other issue, he has a son, Arthur Charles Lucas, born in 1853, and\r\neducated at Harrow: he is a J.P. and D.L. for Suffolk, and a magistrate\r\nfor Middlesex and Westminster. Both are gentlemen highly esteemed and\r\nhonoured, and few are more thoroughly entitled to the lofty positions\r\nto which, by honourable industry, great ability, and high character,\r\nthey have attained.\r\n\r\nThe arms of the family of Lucas are—party per bend, _gules_ and\r\n_argent_, a bend, dovetailed, between six annulets, all counterchanged;\r\na crescent for difference. Crest—a demi-griffin, wings expanded,\r\n_gules_, semée of annulets, _argent_. Motto—“Spes et fides.”\r\n\r\nThe mansion is approached from the principal Lodge Entrance by a drive\r\nthrough the park, which is finely timbered with forest trees of large\r\ngrowth. These are chiefly oaks, of which there are some remarkably\r\nfine and gigantic examples. Under these roam innumerable herds of red\r\nand fallow deer, which add much to the beauty of the park scenery.\r\nThe Lodge, with its overhanging roofs, its mullioned windows, its\r\ngeometrical chimney-shafts, and its advanced porch, is one of the most\r\npicturesque and pleasant in the county.\r\n\r\nThe mansion itself is situated on an eminence, and commands extensive\r\nviews of the surrounding country. On the east side is the Carriage\r\nEntrance, which is a spacious gravelled court-yard, enclosed next the\r\npark by a stone balustrade. On the south side is the South or Grand\r\nTerrace, a fine promenade walk some six hundred feet in length by\r\ntwenty feet in width, adorned with statuary, and overhung and shaded by\r\nmagnificent trees. This terrace is supported, at an elevation from the\r\npark of about ten feet, by a massive stone wall and elegantly designed\r\nbalustrade. In the recesses are fine examples of sculpture, and the\r\nbalustrade itself supports a number of elegant vases, terminals, and\r\nother ornaments, placed at regular distances. The park from this point\r\nslopes gently away till it ends in a fine ornamental Lake. Looking\r\nto the eastward, down a lovely glade in the park, another and more\r\nmagnificent piece of water, covering an area of over thirty acres, is\r\nseen in the distance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The South or Grand Terrace._]\r\n\r\nOn the right, while passing along to the west end of this terrace,\r\nstands the Conservatory. It is filled with the choicest exotic palms,\r\ntree ferns, and flowering plants; and in the centre, on a massive\r\nmarble base, stands a magnificent sculptured group of figures in white\r\nmarble. The floor is geometrical in pattern, and the appointments, the\r\nvases, the flower-stands, &c., are all characterized by good taste in\r\ntheir arrangement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Garden Front._]\r\n\r\nThe surrounding grounds are beautifully undulating and diversified,\r\nand comprise the Flower Garden, Croquet Lawn, and American Garden. The\r\nlatter is situated in a natural dip of the grounds, and is completely\r\nencircled and sheltered by a dense mass of oaks and other forest trees,\r\nat the foot of which is a broad belt of common laurel, rhododendron,\r\n&c. Then follows a winding walk, encircling about an acre of grass\r\nlawn, on which are planted masses of azalea, rhododendron, kalmea,\r\nandromeda, specimen coniferæ, &c., the whole producing a strikingly\r\npleasing effect. Arrived at the end of this terrace, the visitor\r\ndescends, by means of a broad flight of steps, to another terrace walk\r\nnearly a quarter of a mile in length, and flanked for most of that\r\ndistance on each side with masses of rhododendrons alternated with\r\nsome fine specimens of _Cedrus deodara_ and the Chinese juniper. Again\r\ndescending by another flight of steps to the left, access is gained to\r\nthe Rose Garden. This “garden of roses,” which is of perfect Eastern\r\nloveliness, takes the form of a half-circle, the whole of which is\r\nfilled with the choicest roses, the outer line being backed by a broad\r\nbelt of flowering rhododendrons. Some idea may be formed of the size\r\nand importance of this Rose Garden from the fact that it contains\r\nupwards of a thousand standard roses, and nearly as many dwarf roses,\r\nand these comprise examples of every colour, shade, and variety that\r\nare worth cultivating. The effect, when these are fully in flower, is\r\nenchanting in the extreme.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Mansion and Conservatory, from the Grounds._]\r\n\r\nIn close proximity to this, but shut out by a high wall covered with\r\n_Magnolia grandiflora_, are the Forcing and Plant Houses: these occupy\r\nthree sides of a square. Passing through the upper side, which is a\r\nrange of span-roofed houses, we find it embraces a Show House (kept\r\ngay with flowers the year round), Fernery, Plant, Stove, and Camellia\r\nHouse, in which latter is a plant of the old double white camellia\r\ntwenty feet across, and rather more than that in height, besides many\r\nother fine specimens of those choicest and most beautiful of flowers.\r\nLeaving this house, the visitor passes through about two hundred feet\r\nin length of Vineries and Peach Houses, filled with their luscious\r\ntreasures in different stages of growth. Thus the third side of the\r\nsquare is gained. This is another range of span Plant Houses, the\r\ncentre division being a Rose House, planted chiefly with tea-scented\r\nroses. In the centre of this square, and running parallel with the two\r\nend ranges, is a large late Peach House, 65 feet long by 24 feet wide:\r\nthis spans the walk which connects this square with the lower terrace.\r\n\r\nAt the back of these houses are the Kitchen Gardens, which comprise\r\nabout four acres: these are well walled, and have a good wall to the\r\nsouth. The soil being a retentive clay, fruit trees, as well as most\r\nvegetables, thrive well. Here, also, are extensive ranges of pits used\r\nfor forcing early vegetables, pot vines, melons, cucumbers, and bedding\r\nplants, of which latter about thirty thousand are grown and planted\r\nannually. Here, too, are the Orchid House, containing many valuable\r\nplants; Gardenia House; and range of Fig Houses. Covering the back wall\r\nof the range of Vineries before alluded to, and facing the Kitchen\r\nGardens, are the Fruit Rooms, Mushroom House, Potting Sheds—also the\r\nyoung men’s rooms: these are spacious, and contain every convenience\r\nfor their comfort. Too much credit cannot be given Mr. Lucas for the\r\nmanner in which he thus studies the comfort of his _employés_, both in\r\nthis and in other particulars.\r\n\r\nThe most striking feature in the Kitchen Gardens is the Head Gardener’s\r\nCottage. This is a picture of architectural beauty, and, from its\r\nelevated position, commands a view of every part of the gardens, as\r\nwell as most extensive prospects of the surrounding country. Not only\r\nhas the external appearance of this model cottage been made matter\r\nof study, but the interior, also, is replete with every domestic\r\nconvenience. It is one of the most charming of residences, and its\r\noccupant, Mr. Lucas’s head gardener, is one of the most accomplished\r\nin his profession. To his good taste and skill much of the beauty and\r\nattractiveness of the place is due.\r\n\r\nThe north side of these gardens is bounded by a newly planted Orchard,\r\ncontaining above a hundred fine standard trees of all the best\r\nvarieties of apples, pears, plums, &c. This is followed by about two\r\nacres planted as a Pinetum, in which are many valuable and promising\r\nyoung specimen coniferæ. This is continued down to the north carriage\r\ndrive, where it is bounded by a belt of evergreen shrubs, &c. It may\r\nnot be out of place here to add that the whole of these gardens owe\r\ntheir existence, as well as their present state of high keeping, to\r\ntheir present estimable owner, who has spared no expense in their\r\nformation or subsequent management, and whose love of the beautiful,\r\nwhether in Nature or in Art, is unbounded.\r\n\r\nThe internal arrangements of the house—which, besides all the\r\ncustomary reception and state apartments and the domestic offices,\r\ncontains an unusual number of bed-rooms—are all that can be desired,\r\nboth for elegance and for home comforts; and the furnishing and\r\nappointments are such as eminently to entitle Warnham Court to be\r\nranked as a home of taste. Mr. Lucas is a liberal patron of Art, and\r\nboth here and at his town mansion the walls are hung with pictures of\r\nmatchless excellence and of great price. They are chiefly by modern,\r\nand most of them by British, artists: a list of them would include\r\nnearly all the best painters of the age.\r\n\r\nThe park is some three hundred and fifty acres in extent, the farm\r\noccupies about six hundred acres more, and the pleasure-grounds add\r\nanother fifty acres to the total, so that Warnham Court is a fine and\r\nnoble property, and one unmatched in its district.\r\n\r\nIt would ill become us, in any notice of the parish of Warnham, to\r\nomit the mention of one of its worthies—Percy Bysshe Shelley. This\r\nill-fated, but gifted, poet was born at Field Place, on Broad-bridge\r\nHeath, Warnham, on the 4th of August, 1792. He was the grandson of\r\nSir Bysshe Shelley, Bart., of Castle Goring, who married twice, and\r\nhad, by his first wife, with other issue, a son and successor, Sir\r\nTimothy Shelley, who married Elizabeth, daughter of Charles Pinfold,\r\nEsq., of Etchingham, in Surrey: their eldest son was the poet. Percy\r\nBysshe Shelley received his first education from the Rev. Mr. Edwards,\r\nvicar of Warnham, and was then sent to school at Brentford, with his\r\nyoung cousin, Thomas Medwin. At thirteen Shelley was sent to Eton. At\r\neighteen, having previously written much poetry, he produced his “Queen\r\nMab;” and in 1810 he entered University College, Oxford. “At the age of\r\nnineteen he published a pamphlet embodying the arguments of Voltaire\r\nand the false philosophy of that school, which was speedily circulated\r\namongst those in authority.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _View from the North-west._]\r\n\r\nThis reckless act coloured all his subsequent life: it led to his\r\nexpulsion from college, to the breaking off of a match with his cousin,\r\nand to his being discarded by his father. Soon afterwards young Shelley\r\nmarried Miss Westbrook, at Gretna Green, and resided first at Keswick,\r\nnext in Ireland (where he published some political pamphlets), and\r\nafterwards in Wales. After three years of married life and the birth of\r\ntwo children, Shelley and his wife separated in 1814, and he went to\r\nSwitzerland, where he formed the friendship of Lord Byron, which closed\r\nonly with his death. In 1816 he was recalled from Switzerland by the\r\ntragic fate of his wife, who committed suicide by drowning; and shortly\r\nafterwards, her father, Mr. Westbrook, succeeded in an application to\r\ndeprive him of the guardianship of his children. Soon after the death\r\nof his wife, Shelley married Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin, daughter of\r\nthe notorious free-thinker William Godwin, and herself the authoress of\r\n“Frankenstein,” and they settled at Great Marlow, where he published\r\nhis “Alastor” and “The Revolt of Islam.” In 1818 they quitted England\r\nfor Italy, and from that time to his death every year “gave evidence of\r\nShelley’s untiring intellectual energy in the production of numerous\r\npoems and other pieces,” including “Adonais,” “The Cenci,” “Prometheus\r\nBound,” &c. After spending some time in Rome and Naples and various\r\nplaces, “Mr. and Mrs. Shelley engaged a house at Lerici, on the Bay of\r\nSpezzia, and it was here that he met his premature and lamented death.\r\nOn the 8th of July, 1822, he set sail in his little schooner-yacht,\r\na vessel wholly unfit to encounter the squalls of the Mediterranean,\r\naccompanied by his friend Captain Williams, to meet Leigh Hunt, who\r\nwas with Lord Byron at Pisa. A few days afterwards Shelley left his\r\nfriends, intending to return with Captain Williams, and set sail, in\r\nspite of the unfavourable change in the weather, with an English boy,\r\nnamed Charles Vivian, added to the party. They were off Via Reggio,\r\nat some distance from the shore, when a storm was driven over the sea\r\nwhich enveloped all in darkness; the cloud passed onwards, but the\r\nlittle schooner had vanished. At the end of a dreadful week of suspense\r\nthe worst fears of his friends were confirmed. The body of Shelley was\r\nwashed on shore near Via Reggio, that of Captain Williams at a spot\r\nabout four miles distant, but that of Charles Vivian was not found for\r\nthree weeks afterwards. The bodies were burnt in accordance with the\r\nItalian laws of quarantine, in the presence of Lord Byron and Leigh\r\nHunt, and Shelley’s ashes were afterwards enclosed in an urn, and\r\ndeposited in the English cemetery at Rome, by the side of his infant\r\nson William.” “You will have heard by this time,” says Byron, when\r\nwriting to Moore on the 2nd of August, 1822, “that Shelley and another\r\ngentleman (Captain Williams) were drowned about a month ago (a month\r\nyesterday), in a squall off the Gulf of Spezzia. There is thus another\r\nman gone about whom the world was ill-naturedly, and ignorantly, and\r\nbrutally mistaken. It will perhaps do him justice _now_, when he can\r\nbe no better for it.” Dying before his father (Sir Timothy), Shelley\r\ndid not, of course, succeed to the family estates; but, on the death of\r\nSir Timothy in 1844, the son of the poet succeeded, and is the present\r\nhead of the family, Sir Percy Florence Shelley, Bart., of Field Place,\r\nWarnham.\r\n\r\nAround Warnham the neighbourhood is one unbroken succession of pleasant\r\nscenery and of delightful “nooks and corners;” and the district is\r\nstudded with many pleasant residences. Within a few miles, too, are\r\nHorsham, with its fine old church and other objects of interest; St.\r\nLeonard’s Forest, Longhurst, Graylands, Rusper, and a score or two\r\nother places that are full of beauty and interest, and show well what\r\ncharms are furnished by the scenery of Sussex.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOWTHER CASTLE\r\n\r\n\r\nWHETHER from its own nobleness of character, the innate beauty and\r\nloveliness of its situation, the magnificence and even sublimity of its\r\nsurroundings, the grandeur and sumptuous richness of its appointments,\r\nthe extent of its domains, the historical incidents with which it\r\nis connected, the interesting and stirring events which have been\r\nassociated with its history, or the true nobility of character of its\r\nlong line of illustrious owners, Lowther Castle may indeed be classed\r\nas one of the finest, most important, and most stately of the “Stately\r\nHomes” of this favoured land of ours. Situate in one of the most lovely\r\nof shires—Westmoreland—and surrounded on all sides by the most\r\nmagnificent of scenery, Lowther is indeed a “favoured spot”—a spot\r\nwhere Nature has been profuse in her gifts, and where Art has found a\r\nfitting shrine. Here\r\n\r\n          “hills on hills, on forests forests rise;\r\n  Spurn the low earth, and mingle with the skies.”\r\n\r\nMountain and dale, hill and valley, fell and lake, moor and meadow,\r\nwood and stream, are spread around in such lavish profusion that the\r\neye wanders on from one to another in constant change of scene, and the\r\nmind vainly endeavours to grasp their varied beauties. Its situation\r\nis, indeed, a scene of loveliness not easily conceived, and which but\r\nfew “earthly Edens” surpass.\r\n\r\nThe castle itself, as it now stands, is modern; but it was erected\r\non the site of an older mansion, belonging to the same family, which\r\nwas taken down by Sir John Lowther in 1685, who enlarged and rebuilt\r\nit on a scale of much magnificence. The greater part of this second\r\nbuilding, Lowther Hall as it was called, was destroyed by fire in 1720,\r\nthe wings only being left standing; but these were sufficient “to show\r\nthe ancient magnitude and grandeur of this formerly noble structure.”\r\nIn 1808 Lord Lonsdale, whose predecessor for very many years had been\r\nmaking preparations by cutting down timber and collecting together\r\nmaterials for the work, commenced the erection of the present edifice.\r\nIn January, 1808, the first stone was laid, and by the summer of\r\n1809 a portion of the mansion was inhabited by the family. This new\r\nstructure, which is of castellated character, was dignified by the name\r\nof “Lowther Castle,” in place of the old designation of “Hall.” It was\r\nerected from the designs of Sir Robert Smirke, at an enormous cost, and\r\nis considered to be his _chef-d’œuvre_ in that style of architecture,\r\nin which, however, he was not at all times happy. The north front\r\nis thoroughly castellated in its style, the south more ornate and\r\necclesiastical in its character; the whole, however, from whichever\r\nside it is seen, or from whatever point a glimpse is obtained, has a\r\npicturesque appearance and an air of princely magnificence about it\r\nthat are eminently striking and pleasing to the eye.\r\n\r\nLowther Castle stands in a grand old well-wooded park of some six or\r\neight hundred acres. In front, at a little distance, runs the lovely\r\nriver Lowther, with its rocky bed and its wildly romantic banks; at the\r\nback (the south front) are the Lawns and the Deer Park; to the west are\r\nthe Terrace and Pleasure Gardens and wooded walks; and to the east the\r\nStables, Kitchen Gardens, and village.\r\n\r\nThe family of Lowther, of which the present Earl of Lonsdale is the\r\nnoble head, is of considerable antiquity in the border counties of\r\nWestmoreland and Cumberland.\r\n\r\nThe names of William and Thomas Lowther appear as witnesses to a grant\r\nas early as the reign of Henry II., and in the reign of Henry III. were\r\nSir Thomas de Lowther, Knight, Sir Gervase de Lowther, Knight, and\r\nGervase de Lowther, Archdeacon of Carlisle. Succeeding them was Sir\r\nHugh de Lowther, Knight, who was Attorney-General in 1292, represented\r\nthe county in 1300 and 1305, became Justice-Itinerant and Escheator in\r\nEyre north of the Trent; and was in 1331 made one of the Justices of\r\nKing’s Bench. Sir Hugh married a daughter of Sir Peter Tilliol, Knight,\r\nand was succeeded by his eldest son, Sir Hugh Lowther.\r\n\r\nThis Sir Hugh was married twice: first, to a daughter of Lord Lucy, of\r\nCockermouth; and, secondly, to Margaret, daughter of William de Quale.\r\nAt his death, after serving in many important offices, he was succeeded\r\nby his son(?) Sir Robert Lowther, Knight, who died in 1490, leaving\r\nissue by his wife, Margaret Strickland, a son, Sir Hugh, who succeeded\r\nhim, and three daughters, married respectively to Sir Thomas Curwen,\r\nSir James Pickering, and William Lancaster.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Lowther Castle, North Front._]\r\n\r\nSir Hugh de Lowther married Margaret, daughter of John de Derwentwater,\r\nby whom he left, with other issue, his son and successor, Sir Hugh de\r\nLowther, Knight, who represented the county of Cumberland. He married\r\nMabel, daughter of Sir William Lancaster, of Sockbridge, by whom he had\r\na son and heir, Sir Hugh de Lowther, Knight of the Bath, who married\r\nAnne, daughter of Sir Launcelot Threlkeld, and died _circa_ 1511.\r\n\r\nSir John de Lowther, his eldest son, succeeded him, and having married\r\nLucy, daughter of Sir Thomas Curwen, of Workington, had issue by her\r\na son, Sir Hugh, who, having married Dorothy, daughter of Henry, Lord\r\nClifford, had issue as follows:—Sir Richard Lowther, who succeeded to\r\nthe estates (of whom presently); Gerard Lowther, a bencher of Lincoln’s\r\nInn; Margaret Lowther, married to John Richmond, Esq., of Highead\r\nCastle; Anne, married to Thomas Wybergh, Esq., of Clifton; Frances,\r\nmarried to Sir Henry Goodyer, Knight of Powlesworth; and Barbara,\r\nmarried to Thomas Carleton, of Carleton. Sir Hugh, dying during his\r\nfather’s lifetime, the estates passed to his eldest son—\r\n\r\nSir Richard Lowther, Knight, who succeeded his cousin, Henry Lord\r\nScrope, as Lord Warden of the West Marches. Sir Richard “was three\r\ntimes commissioner in the great affairs between England and Scotland\r\nunder Elizabeth.” He had also the unfortunate and ill-fated Mary Queen\r\nof Scots under his charge, and conveyed her to Carlisle. He died in\r\n1607, leaving with other issue, by his wife, Frances, daughter of John\r\nMiddleton, Esq., four sons—viz. Sir Christopher (of whom presently);\r\nSir Gerard Lowther, Chief Justice of Common Pleas and Lord Chancellor\r\nof Ireland; Sir Launcelot Lowther, Knight, a Baron of the Exchequer in\r\nIreland; and William Lowther, Esq., of Ingleton.\r\n\r\nSir Christopher Lowther was knighted by King James at\r\nNewcastle-on-Tyne. He married Eleanor, daughter of Sir William\r\nMusgrave, of Hayton, by whom he had a family of eight sons and four\r\ndaughters. He was succeeded by his son, Sir John Lowther, M.P. for\r\nWestmoreland (married to Eleanor, daughter of William Fleming, of\r\nRydal), who, dying in 1637, was in turn succeeded by his son, Sir John\r\nLowther, M.P. for the same county, who was created a baronet in 1640.\r\nDying in 1675, he was succeeded by his grandson, Sir John Lowther,\r\nwho was “the thirty-first knight of the family in nearly direct\r\nsuccession.” In 1689 he was made Lord-Lieutenant of Westmoreland and\r\nCumberland, and the following year appointed First Commissioner of the\r\nTreasury. In 1696 Sir John was created Baron Lowther of Lowther and\r\nViscount Lonsdale, and, in 1698, was made Lord Privy Seal, and held\r\nmany other offices. Dying in 1700, he was succeeded in his titles and\r\nestates by his son—\r\n\r\nRichard, second Viscount Lonsdale, who died in 1713, when the titles\r\nand estates devolved on his brother Henry, third Viscount Lonsdale, at\r\nwhose death the barony of Lowther and viscountcy of Lonsdale ceased,\r\nthe estates and baronetcy devolving upon his great-nephew, Sir James\r\nLowther, eldest son of Robert Lowther, Esq., Governor of Barbadoes.\r\n\r\nSir James was M.P. for Cumberland and Westmoreland. In 1782 he offered\r\nto build and completely to furnish at his own expense a man-of-war\r\nof seventy guns, but the coming peace rendered this unnecessary.\r\nSir James was, in 1784, created Baron Lowther of Lowther, Viscount\r\nLowther, and Earl of Lonsdale. He married a daughter of the Earl of\r\nBute, but, having no issue by her, his lordship, in 1797, obtained a\r\nnew patent, creating him Baron and Viscount Lowther, with remainder to\r\nthe heirs male of his cousin, the Rev. Sir William Lowther, Bart., of\r\nSwillington. Dying in 1802, the earldom and other titles of the first\r\ncreation became extinct, those of the second patent descending to Sir\r\nWilliam Lowther, who thus became Baron Lowther and Viscount Lowther,\r\nand was, in 1807, created Earl of Lonsdale. His lordship married the\r\nLady Augusta Fane, daughter of John, ninth Earl of Westmoreland, by\r\nwhom he had issue—William, Viscount Lowther, by whom he was succeeded;\r\nthe Hon. Henry Cecil Lowther, M.P.; the Lady Elizabeth Lowther, who\r\ndied unmarried; the Lady Mary Lowther, who married Major-general Lord\r\nFrederick Cavendish-Bentinck, third son of the third Duke of Portland,\r\nand was mother of Mr. G. A. F. Cavendish-Bentinck, M.P. for Whitehaven;\r\nthe Lady Anne Lowther, married to the Right Hon. Sir John Beckett,\r\nBart.; and the Lady Caroline Lowther, married to Lord William John\r\nFrederick Poulett, son of the Duke of Cleveland. Dying in 1844, the\r\nEarl was succeeded by his eldest son—\r\n\r\nWilliam, second Earl of Lonsdale, Viscount and Baron Lowther, and\r\na baronet, who had been summoned to the House of Peers during his\r\nfather’s lifetime as Baron Lowther. He had sat as M.P. for various\r\nplaces from 1801 to 1841, and, among other appointments, successively\r\nheld those of a Lord of the Admiralty, a Lord of the Treasury,\r\nFirst Commissioner of Woods and Forests, Treasurer of the Navy,\r\nVice-President of the Board of Trade, Postmaster-General, and President\r\nof Council. His lordship died unmarried on the 4th of March, 1872, and\r\nwas succeeded by his nephew—\r\n\r\nHenry Lowther, as third Earl of Lonsdale and Viscount and Baron Lowther\r\nof Whitehaven, of the second creation, who was the son of Colonel the\r\nHon. Henry Cecil Lowther (second son of the first earl, by Lady Lucy,\r\ndaughter of the fifth Earl of Harborough). He was born on the 27th\r\nof March, 1818, and succeeded his uncle at his death in 1872. His\r\nlordship was educated at Westminster and at Trinity College, Cambridge,\r\nwhere he took the degree of M.A. in 1838. He was appointed cornet and\r\nsub-lieutenant in the 1st Life Guards in 1841, became lieutenant in\r\n1843, captain in 1849, and retired in 1854. For twenty-four years he\r\nretained the confidence of the electors of West Cumberland, sitting\r\nuninterruptedly for this division from 1847 to 1872, when he succeeded\r\nhis uncle in the title and estates. The seat thus vacant by the late\r\nearl’s accession to the House of Lords was obtained without a contest\r\nby Lord Muncaster. His lordship was Lord-Lieutenant and _Custos\r\nRotulorum_ of Cumberland and Westmoreland, a magistrate for Rutland,\r\nHon. Colonel of the Royal Cumberland Militia and of the Cumberland\r\nRifle Volunteers, Lieutenant-Colonel of the Westmoreland and Cumberland\r\nYeomanry Cavalry, and a member of the Carlton, Boodle’s, Jockey, and\r\nTurf Clubs. Lord Lonsdale married, in 1852, Emily Susan, daughter\r\nof St. George Francis Caulfield, Esq., of Dunamon Castle, county\r\nRoscommon, by whom he left issue living four sons and two daughters.\r\nThese are—St. George Henry Lowther, the present Earl of Lonsdale; the\r\nHon. Hugh Cecil Lowther, born in 1857; the Hon. Charles Edwin Lowther,\r\nborn in 1859; the Hon. Lancelot Edward Lowther, born in 1867; the Lady\r\nSybil Emily Lowther; and the Lady Verena Maud Lowther. His lordship\r\ndied somewhat suddenly on the 15th of August, 1876, and was buried the\r\nSaturday following in Lowther Church.\r\n\r\nThe present noble head of the House of Lowther, St. George Henry,\r\nfourth Earl of Lonsdale and Viscount and Baron Lowther of Whitehaven,\r\nand a baronet, was born on the 4th of October, 1855, and therefore\r\nsucceeded to the titles and estates a few weeks before attaining\r\nhis majority. His lordship was, in 1875, appointed Sub-Lieutenant of\r\nthe Royal Cumberland Militia, and shortly afterwards transferred to\r\nthe Nottingham Royal Sherwood Rangers. He is patron of forty-three\r\nlivings—viz. Aikton, Armathwaite, Bootle, Bolton, Bowness, Brigham,\r\nButtermere, Cockermouth, Cleator, Corney, Distingdon, Embleton,\r\nGosforth, Hensingham, Haile, Kirkandrews-upon-Eden, Kirkbride, Lorton,\r\nLoweswater, Moresby, Mosser, St. Bees, Threlkeld, Whicham, Whitbeck,\r\nSt. James, Christchurch, St. Nicholas, and Holy Trinity, Whitehaven;\r\nAskham, Bampton, Barton, Kirkby Stephen, Lowther, Patterdale, Clifton,\r\nRavenstonedale, Shap, Startforth (Yorkshire), Bampton Kirk, Orton, St.\r\nJohn’s-in-the-Vale, and Crosthwaite.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe arms of the Earl of Lonsdale are—_or_, six annulets, three, two,\r\nand one, _sable_. Crest, a dragon, _argent_. Supporters, two horses,\r\n_argent_, gorged with wreaths of laurel, _vert_. His seats are Lowther\r\nCastle, Westmoreland; Whitehaven Castle, Cumberland; Barleythorpe, near\r\nOakham, Rutland; and Carlton House Terrace, London.\r\n\r\nLowther Castle is entered by a massive porch in the centre of its north\r\nfront, the door, which is garnished with magnificent bronze knockers,\r\ngiving access to the grand Entrance Hall. This is a noble Gothic\r\napartment, some sixty feet long by thirty feet in width, ceiled with\r\npanelled oak. The entrance doorway is in the centre of the north side,\r\nand immediately in front is the Grand Staircase, across the landing of\r\nwhich is a noble arcade of three lofty pointed archways rising from\r\nclustered columns. From the angled corners of the Hall doorways open\r\nto passages leading to the domestic offices. At each end of this fine\r\napartment, and again in front of each pillar between and adjoining\r\nthe flights of stairs, are suits of ancient armour standing on lofty\r\npedestals, ranges of the old “Black Bess” guns of the old Cumberland\r\nMilitia and other trophies of arms decorating the walls.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Staircase, sixty feet square and ninety feet in height,\r\nleads up from the Entrance Hall to the various suites of apartments.\r\nIt is entirely of stone, and has a richly groined ceiling rising from\r\nclustered columns. Facing the entrance, on the first landing, is a\r\nmagnificent vase, and in canopied niches in the wall are exquisitely\r\nsculptured figures, the arms of Lowther and the alliances of the family\r\nalso appropriately decorating the walls. The Staircase is of four\r\nheights, the upper forming a triforium passage, over which are windows\r\nfilled with rich Gothic tracery and stained glass. The centre of the\r\nelaborately groined ceiling is panelled, and bears the inscription:\r\n“+ Edif^t. Cul^s. Com. de Lonsdale an^o. Regni L^o. R^s. Geo^i. III.\r\nA^o. D^i. MDCCCX: cur^e. Rob^o. Smirke.” Arms and banners decorate the\r\nwalls, and plants and flowers, arranged to line the staircases in every\r\ndirection, add immeasurably to the beauty and the comfort as well as to\r\nthe stateliness of this fine portion of the edifice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Lowther Castle, South Front._]\r\n\r\nIt will not be necessary to enter fully into a description of the\r\nvarious apartments of this noble residence; they are all sumptuous in\r\ntheir furnishing, admirable in their appointments, and replete with\r\neverything that can make a “home of taste” enjoyable. Some of the\r\napartments, however, require special notice, and to each of these we\r\nproceed to devote a few lines—not taking them in any given order, but\r\nas we saw them on our recent visit.\r\n\r\nPassing to the second landing through an “ante-room to the sleeping\r\napartments,” in which are preserved a valuable and extensive collection\r\nof Ceramics arranged in glass cases, and also a number of antiquities,\r\nare the State Bed-room and its suite of dressing-rooms. These are all\r\nhung with remarkably fine Gobelins tapestry. These noble apartments\r\noccupy the space in the centre of the south front, and from the windows\r\nare lovely views of the Grounds and Deer Park. The state bed, which is\r\nhung with white satin richly embroidered, is of black and gold, the\r\nmassive cornice, solidly gilt, being surrounded by angels, five on each\r\nside and four at the foot, and reminding one of the charming nursery\r\nrhyme of our childish days:—\r\n\r\n  “Four corners to my bed,\r\n  Four angels round me spread;\r\n  One to sing, and one to pray,\r\n  And two to carry my soul away!”\r\n\r\nThe appointments of the room are of the most sumptuous character, the\r\ntoilet service of silver gilt adding much to its magnificence.\r\n\r\nOn the landing of the Grand Staircase, among other Art treasures are\r\nLawrence’s full-length portrait of George IV., Greenhill’s Walpole,\r\nKneller’s Duke of Marlborough, Addison, and other paintings; and in the\r\neast ante-room leading to the sleeping apartments in that part of the\r\ncastle are various objects of note.\r\n\r\nOn the first or ground floor landing of the Grand Staircase, to the\r\nright, between the private apartments, is a corridor leading to various\r\nrooms, and to the left a similar corridor, from which open the Library\r\nand other apartments, leads to the Gallery of Worthies, and gives\r\naccess to the Sculpture Gallery; it has a groined ceiling, and contains\r\na large and powerful organ, wall-cases of books, and some valuable\r\npaintings and busts.\r\n\r\nThe Library is in the north front, and is a noble and well-appointed\r\nroom, fitted in a style of quiet sumptuousness that is in full accord\r\nwith the rich collection of rare literary treasures with which\r\nthe walls are lined. The ceiling is of panelled oak of suitable\r\nGothic character, heightened with gold, and the presses for books\r\nare also of oak richly adorned with cinquefoil cusps. Besides its\r\nliterary treasures, the Library is hung with a fine collection of\r\nfamily portraits of surpassing interest. These are (beginning at the\r\nnorth-east corner of the apartment)—Sir John Lowther, of Lowther,\r\nBart., 1657; Sir John Lowther, _fils_, 1675; James, Earl of Lonsdale,\r\nknown as “the eccentric earl;” Sir Christopher Lowther, Bart.;\r\nEleanor, wife of Sir John Lowther; Henry, third Viscount Lonsdale;\r\nRichard, second Viscount Lonsdale; Sir John Lowther, Bart.; Hon.\r\nAnthony Lowther; Jane, wife of Sir John Lowther; Rev. Sir William\r\nLowther, Bart.; Sir James Lowther, Bart.; Robert Lowther, Esq.; Sir\r\nJohn Lowther, Bart.; and William, Earl of Lonsdale, K.G. Among other\r\nobjects of interest preserved in this room is a table formed of the\r\nwood of one of the piles of old London Bridge, with a small portion of\r\nthe “Abdication Tree” of Napoleon inserted. It bears this inscription,\r\n“Made out of one of the piles supporting the chapel arch of London\r\nBridge. Supposed date, 1176. The gift of John Rennie, architect, 1829.”\r\n“Le cinq d’avril dix-huit cent quatorze Napoleon Bonaparte signa son\r\nabdication sur cette table dans le cabinet de travail du Roi, le 2^{me}\r\naprès la chambre à coucher à Fontainebleau.” “Wilkinson & Sons, 14,\r\nLudgate Hill, 6881.”\r\n\r\nThe Billiard-room, not on account of any architectural features or of\r\nthe use to which it is assigned, but from the remarkably interesting\r\ncharacter of the collection of pictures contained within its walls,\r\nis one of the most important features of the castle. Its walls are\r\nhung with portraits of “Westmoreland Worthies,” forming a gallery of\r\ncelebrities of which not only the county, but the nation may indeed\r\nwell be proud, and the founding of which is a lasting honour to the\r\nHouse of Lowther. Well indeed would it be if the example of forming\r\nlocal Galleries of Worthies, so nobly set by the second Earl of\r\nLonsdale, were followed by the Lords-Lieutenant of other counties\r\nwhose high functions and important positions point them out especially\r\nas the right parties to honour native worth, and their mansions as\r\nthe right and proper and only place in which such a gallery should be\r\nenshrined. The collection of “Westmoreland Worthies” at Lowther Castle\r\nis a noble beginning in the right direction, and it is to be hoped\r\nthe spirit and feeling that caused its foundation by one of the noble\r\nheads of the House of Lowther may still actuate his successors, and\r\ncause what is now a glorious nucleus to become a full and complete\r\ncollection. The portraits at present contained in this gallery\r\nare—Queen Catherine Parr, wife of Henry VIII., born at Kendal Castle;\r\nChristopher Baynbrigg, Cardinal of St. Praxede, Legate to the Court of\r\nRome, Archbishop of York, Master of the Rolls, &c.; George Clifford,\r\nEarl of Cumberland; Sir Gerard Lowther, Lord Chief Justice of the Court\r\nof Common Pleas, Ireland; the Marquis of Wharton; the Right Hon.\r\nJoseph Addison; John, First Viscount Lonsdale; the Hon. Justice Wilson;\r\nSir Alan Chambre; Dr. Burn, LL.D., the historian of Westmoreland and\r\nCumberland, and author of the “Justice of the Peace;” Lord Langdale;\r\nAlderman Thompson, Lord Mayor of London; Sir George Fleming, Bishop\r\nof Carlisle; Gibson, Bishop of London; John Bell, Chancery barrister;\r\nRichard Braithwaite, author of the “English Gentleman,” &c.; Dean\r\nAddison; Dr. Shaw; Waugh, Bishop of Carlisle; Duke of Wharton;\r\nAdmiral Sir Charles Richardson; John Langhorne, D.D.; Watson, Bishop\r\nof Llandaff; Bernard Gilpin; General Bowser; Thomas Barlow; William\r\nHogarth, whose ancestors belonged to the county; Dr. Fothergill; the\r\nCountess of Pembroke, who once wrote, when pressed to put in a court\r\ncandidate for the borough of Appleby, “Sir, I have been bullied by an\r\nusurper, I have been neglected by a court, but I will not be dictated\r\nto by a subject. Your man shan’t stand;” Admiral Pearson, famous for\r\nhis engagement with Paul Jones; John Robinson, Surveyor-General of\r\nWoods and Forests, who is represented holding in his hand a “Report of\r\nAcorns planted in and about Windsor Great Park,” &c.[49]\r\n\r\nIt may be named _en passant_ that in various parts of the castle are\r\na number of paintings—supposed to be veritable Hogarths—which were\r\nbrought from the old Vauxhall Gardens.\r\n\r\nThe Drawing-room, opposite the Library, is a lovely apartment—the\r\nwalls hung with costly figured satin, the ceiling richly groined in\r\nelaborate fan-tracery, and the furniture as sumptuous and elegant as\r\nthe most exquisite and fastidious taste could desire, or the most\r\nlavish expenditure procure. Among the furniture is a magnificent suite\r\nof couch, chairs, and stools, which are of historic interest; they\r\nbelonged to Tippoo Sahib, and are marvels of Indian Art workmanship in\r\nivory and gold. It is not, however, our province to speak in detail\r\nof any of the appointments or furnishing of the rooms; all we can say\r\nis that the Drawing-room and other apartments are rich storehouses\r\nof exquisite gems of loveliness, such as one might naturally expect\r\nwould characterize a home presided over by a lady of such pure taste\r\nand such high accomplishments as the present Countess of Lonsdale.\r\nWe must, however, casually allude to one literary treasure which is\r\nkept in the Drawing-room—an album in which have been written by their\r\nown hands, at various times when visiting Lowther, poetical or prose\r\ncontributions by Sir Walter Scott, William Wordsworth, Robert Southey\r\n(13th October, 1824), Samuel Rogers (January 23rd, 1826), the Duke of\r\nWellington (January 2nd, 1829), Sir Humphry Davy (Sept. 11th, 1826),\r\nHon. G. O’Callagan, Amelia Opie, and others; while it is also graced\r\nby original drawings made on its pages by Dewint, Page, Sir George\r\nBeaumont, Lady Anne Beckett, Lady Delamere, Lady Farnborough, Lady F.\r\nBentinck, the Marchioness of Stafford, &c.\r\n\r\nThe Saloon, in the centre of the south front, has a Gothic panelled\r\nceiling, and contains many fine paintings by Zuccarelli, Guido,\r\nElisabetta Sirani, &c., and (as well as other parts of the house) some\r\ngrand old china. The Dining-room has two fine paintings—Pitt, by\r\nHoppner, and Wellington, by Jackson; and in the centre of the gorgeous\r\ndisplay of gold plate on the buffet is a full-sized silver-gilt copy of\r\nFlaxman’s _chef-d’œuvre_, the Shield of Achilles.\r\n\r\nThe Countess’s or Breakfast Room contains some of the richest treasures\r\nof Art in the castle. Among them are the Wakes, the Feast, and the\r\nFête Champêtre of Teniers; a Holy Family of Rubens; and marvellously\r\nfine examples of Vandyke, Fyt, Wouvermans, Leonardo da Vinci, Gerard\r\nDouw, FrankHals, Ruysdael, Borgognone, Rembrandt, Jan Steen, Bischey,\r\nSassoferrato, Titian, and others.\r\n\r\nThe Picture Gallery, with its glass ceiling, is a noble room, filled\r\nwith pictures of high merit, many being _chefs-d’œuvre_ of the various\r\nartists. It will be sufficient to say that it contains, among others,\r\nno less than ten Snyders of large size and of almost unmatched\r\nexcellence (the only others we know of equal or more excellence being\r\nthose at Welbeck), and admirable examples of Tintoretti, Titian (a\r\nremarkably fine picture), Guido, Paolo Veronese, Paris Bordone, Luca\r\nGiordano, Backhuysen, Zuccarelli, Hogarth, Bernardo Canaletto, Poussin,\r\nCarlo Cignani, Salvator Rosa, Bordenone, Lely (a nude Nell Gwynne,\r\nwhich contrasts very unfavourably with the Titian on the same walls),\r\nPaul Bril, Bronzino, Bassano, Fyt, Delia Nottie, Murillo, Zucchero, &c.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Lowther Castle, the Sculpture Gallery._]\r\n\r\nThe other apartments, beautiful as they all undoubtedly are, and filled\r\nas they are with choice works of Art, are not necessary to be named.\r\nThere are, however, two of the most important features of Lowther yet\r\nto be noticed. These are the two Sculpture Galleries and the passages\r\nand corridors leading to them. To these we proceed to direct brief\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Roman Sculptured Stone from Kirkby Thore._]\r\n\r\nIn one part of the Gallery is a marvellously extensive and highly\r\nimportant assemblage of Roman inscribed stones—altars, monumental\r\nstones, inscriptions of cohorts, &c.—from the Roman wall and from\r\nthe old stations in the three counties; mediæval sculptures from\r\nthe neighbourhood; and a number of Celtic and Roman urns and other\r\nantiquities of more than passing interest: to these, however, we cannot\r\nfind space to direct attention.[50] Among the Roman sculptured stones\r\nat Lowther Castle are the following:—From Drumburgh a fragment,\r\nbearing the words—\r\n\r\n  PEDATVRA\r\n  VINDO\r\n  MORVCI\r\n\r\nVindomora being a station in the first Iter of Antonine; another\r\nwith the words COH VII (cohors septima); and a stone bearing a\r\nfemale helmeted figure, holding a wreath in her right, and a distaff\r\nin her left, hand. From Kirkby Thore the upper part of an altar,\r\ninscribed IOVI SERAPI L ALFENVS PATE[RNVS] (Iovi Serapi Lucius Alfenus\r\nPate[rnus]); a singular sculptured stone bearing a representation of a\r\ndeath-bed scene, the sufferer partaking of her last meal preparatory to\r\nher departure, the only inscription left being FILIA CRESC IMAG NIER\r\n(Filia Crescentis imag[i]nif[e]r[i]); a stone representing a mounted\r\nwarrior with uplifted sword, trampling on a foe; a fragment of another,\r\nwhere the mounted warrior is in full career, spearing his prostrate\r\nfoe; another stone, bearing much the same design as the last, but in a\r\nmore complete state; a fir-cone; a female head; and a lion overpowering\r\na ram. From Plumpton, or Old Penrith, a remarkably fine sepulchral\r\ninscribed stone, bearing a figure, probably intended to represent a\r\ndeceased child. He is dressed in a tunic, and holds in his left hand a\r\nwhip, and in his right a kind of toy. The inscription is—\r\n\r\n  DIS\r\n  MANIB M COCCEI\r\n  NONNI ANNOR V\r\n  HIC SITVS EST\r\n\r\n(Diis Manibus Marci Cocceii Nonni annorum quinque his situs est); and\r\nanother bearing the inscription—\r\n\r\n        D M\r\n  YLAE ALVM\r\n  NI KARIS\r\n  SIMI VIXI[T]\r\n  [A]N XIII CL S[E]\r\n  VERVS INL ...\r\n\r\n(Diis Manibus Ylæ alumni carissimi. Vixit annos tredecim. Claudius\r\nSeverus....)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Roman Altars from Old Penrith._]\r\n\r\nAmong the antique sculpture contained in the galleries is the Venus\r\nfrom the temple to that goddess at Cnidus. The exquisite torso, the\r\nremainder of the figure being restored, was from the Stowe collection;\r\nand it is undoubtedly an example of the purest Greek, of an age “when\r\nArt was a religion.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Roman Remains from Kirkby Thore._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Roman Remains from Drumburgh and Kirkby Thore._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Roman Remains from Kirkby Thore._]\r\n\r\nIt has with reason been attributed to Praxiteles; and it is believed\r\nto be the work alluded to by Lucian and Pliny as one of the triumphs\r\nof Greek Art—a belief which obtains force with all Art-lovers by\r\nwhom it has been seen. There are also a statue of Diana, of exceeding\r\ngrace and beauty; a Statue of Julius Caesar, half life-size, seated in\r\na consular chair, and of fine conception; the upper half of a seated\r\nfemale figure, draped, brought to England by Lord Guildford, and the\r\nonly specimen brought home by him—a great work, certainly a production\r\nof the best era of Greece, and a majestic, yet tender creation; a\r\nstatue of Agrippina, of rare excellence, from the Stowe collection; a\r\ntorso of a Venus, from the Marquis of Hertford’s collection—a work of\r\nrefined delicacy, yet exhibiting intense power; a statue of Bacchus, a\r\nrelic of great worth; a beautiful statue of Hygeia, from the Besborough\r\ncollection—a work of pure Art, originally from the Capitol; a Roman\r\nsarcophagus, from the same collection, with Cupids hunting in relief; a\r\nmonument from the Besborough collection, inscribed “Honos est præmium\r\nvirtutis,” and several other sarcophagi and monuments; a rich example\r\nof moulding from the Palace of the Cæsars; a figure of Mars; some\r\nvases; statues of Marcus Aurelius, Bacchus, Agrippina, and Diana; busts\r\nof Livia, Trajan, Janus, Cato, Vitellius, Nero, Sylla, Seneca, Plato,\r\nMarcus Pompeius, Galba, Agrippina, Faustina, Matidia, Homer, Nerva, the\r\nCæsars, and Æsculapius; and a bronze statue of Hercules.\r\n\r\nThere are also some fine stone chairs, an Egyptian bath, statues of\r\nPan, Augustus, a roman Senator, Hygeia, Euterpe, Flora, Cybele, Adonis,\r\nParis, the Water-carrier, Sphinx, Cicero, Aristides, &c.; and “the\r\nOlympian Meta, brought from Greece by the Emperor Nero, and placed\r\nin the circus at Rome.” It was purchased by the Marquis of Hertford,\r\nand was formerly in his collection. It now forms one of the more\r\ninteresting features of the Lowther Gallery.\r\n\r\nAmong other interesting objects are roman sarcophagi (the form of one\r\nof which was copied for one of the Earls of Lonsdale to be interred in)\r\nbearing the inscriptions—\r\n\r\n                 D M                   D M\r\n              C MESSIO          C TVTILIO RVPINO\r\n              SEQVMDINO           XVO VENATORI\r\n              QVI VIXIT        T.

Discovered in\r\nthe ruins of the Palace of Pope Leo the 12th, at Villa Chichignola.\r\nPresented by Pope Gregory the 16th to Sir Edward Thomason, in the year\r\n1832;” and some other mosaics. There are also exquisite marble busts\r\nof Pitt, Wellington, George III., the Duke of York, Lord Liverpool,\r\nand others, as well as Chantrey’s charming head of our present beloved\r\nQueen Victoria when a little child.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _In the Grounds of Lowther Castle._]\r\n\r\nThe Grounds and Gardens of Lowther Castle are among its most glorious\r\nand charming attractions. Nature has done much for it in the beauty of\r\nits situation and the majestic character of its surroundings; and the\r\npurest taste in Art, allied to the most consummate skill, has taken\r\nadvantage of those natural beauties, and added charm upon charm to\r\nthe place. On the west front are lawns (divided from the Deer Park by\r\na sunk fence) laid out tastefully in beds rich in their profusion of\r\ncolours. At the west end of the mansion is the Conservatory, and near,\r\nbut below it, approached by a flight of steps from the Terrace, is\r\nthe Countess’s Garden. The site of this exquisitely lovely spot is a\r\nnatural dell, and its sloping sides are turfed and planted, while the\r\ncentre is somewhat elaborately, and with faultless taste, laid out in\r\ngeometrical form, and filled with the choicest and richest of flowers;\r\nthe disposition of the vases, the arrangement of the beds, and the\r\nharmonious blending of the colour showing the purest taste and a high\r\norder of skill on the part of the head-gardener, to whom it owes its\r\norigin. Near this is the Yew Avenue—a walk densely covered in by the\r\nintertwined branches and foliage of the rows of yew-trees, hundreds of\r\nyears old, which range along its sides. From here pathways lead on to\r\nthe Terrace outside the wood.\r\n\r\nOf the Terrace it is impossible to convey an idea. It is simply a\r\ntract of high land, thickly wooded with the finest of forest trees and\r\nthe most majestic of conifers, around the outer edge of which runs a\r\nbroad grassy walk or drive, commanding almost a panorama of the finest\r\nof views that even this district of marvellous scenery can produce.\r\nFrom here, in one direction, is Knipe Scar, rising above the village\r\nof Bampton; and behind it, again, are Swindale, Walla Crag, beneath\r\nwhich is the lovely lake of Haweswater, and above these, again, rise\r\nHarter Fell and High Street (over which runs the old Roman road). Then\r\nthe hamlet of Helton, and further to the right Helvellyn and other\r\nmountains above Ulleswater. Again, there is Askham, with the heights of\r\nBlencathra or Saddleback, and the mountains in the Keswick district;\r\nwhile through the Park, far down below, runs the river Lowther, whose\r\nmurmurs over its rocky bed are distinctly audible. In the wood which\r\nskirts the Terrace are some gigantic conifers and other trees which are\r\n“great among the greatest.”[51]\r\n\r\nThe Kitchen Gardens, at some distance from the mansion, are well\r\narranged, very extensive (about seven acres), and extremely productive;\r\nand their pleasing effect is much heightened by the judicious\r\nintroduction of richly arranged flower borders: the glass houses of all\r\nkinds are of great extent.\r\n\r\nAt a little distance across the park is Lowther Church, with the family\r\nMausoleum in its churchyard. The Mausoleum, upon which the gifted poet,\r\nthe Rev. James Dixon, wrote the following stanza—\r\n\r\n  “A grander, fairer spot of English ground\r\n    To rest in till the trump of doom shall blow\r\n    From the high heavens through land and sea below,\r\n  In all this ancient realm could not be found.\r\n  Sheer from beneath, the river’s amber flood,\r\n    Breaking in white waves ‘gainst the stony shores,\r\n    Round this green eminence for ever pours\r\n  The loud voice of its waters, through the wood\r\n  That clothes its banks, and crowns the airy hills\r\n    And verdant slopes of Lowther’s wide domain,\r\n    Swelling and falling with the grand refrain\r\n  Of Nature’s voice omnipotent. What heart but thrills\r\n    To these wild charms, lit by the vernal beams,\r\n    Grey wood, green lawn, and river’s dancing gleams?”——\r\n\r\nis a plain Gothic building, containing in its upper room a finely\r\nsculptured figure, by Stephens, of “William, Earl of Lonsdale,” 1863.\r\nThe Church possesses some good Norman features which are worthy of\r\ncareful examination, and many interesting monuments to the Lowther\r\nfamily. Among these may be named the following:—\r\n\r\nIn the north transept a large altar tomb to William, first Earl of\r\nLonsdale of the second creation, who died March 19th, 1844; and\r\nAugusta, his countess (daughter of John, ninth Earl of Westmoreland),\r\nwho died March 6th, 1838. Here, too, was buried the late third Earl,\r\nwho died in August, 1876. There are also tablets to the memory of\r\nJames, first Earl of Lonsdale, 1802, and his countess, Mary, daughter\r\nof John, Earl of Bute, 1824; and to Richard, Lord Lonsdale; and brasses\r\nto Colonel the Hon. Henry Cecil Lowther (father of the late earl),\r\n1867; and to Lucy Eleanor, his wife, daughter of Philip, fifth Earl of\r\nHarborough, 1848; and to the Hon. Arthur Lowther, their son, 1855.\r\n\r\nIn the south transept are a remarkably finely sculptured monument with\r\na reclining figure to the memory of John, Viscount Lonsdale and Baron\r\nLowther, 1700, and Catherine, his countess; and other noble monuments\r\nto Sir John Lowther, 1637; Sir John, 1675; and Lord William Frederick\r\nCavendish-Bentinck, who married the Hon. Mary Lowther, 1828. In the\r\nsame transept is a recumbent effigy in plate armour, over which is a\r\ntablet of remarkable character, bearing a family pedigree. This almost\r\nunique example of inscription is as follows, each item being, on the\r\ntablet, enclosed in squares, which, however, we have not followed:—\r\n\r\n      “IOHN LOWTHER of Lowther in ye═╤═LUCYE his wife davghter of S^r\r\n       Covetye of Westmerland Knight │ Christopher Curwin Knight\r\n                                     │\r\n         ┌————————————————————————┬——┘\r\n         │                        │\r\n       HVGNE LOWTHER Esqvire═╤═DORATHYE davghter of Hen^{ry}\r\n              married        │ L^d Clifford  They had issve\r\n                             │\r\n     ┌——————————————┬————————┴———————┬————————————————————————*\r\n     │              │                │\r\n  MARGARET        ANNE married    FRAVNCIS married\r\n  married to Ioh  to Tho Wibersh  to S^r Henrye\r\n  Richmond of     of Clif to      Goodyer\r\n  Highet Esq^r    Esqvire they    of Powlswoorth\r\n  Hath issve      Have issve      Knight\r\n                                  they have iss^e\r\n\r\n *——————┬————————————————————————————————┬———————————————┐\r\n        │                                │               │\r\n  RICHARD LOWTHER═╤═FRANCES the     GERARD LOWTHER   BARBERRIE\r\n  Knight          │ davghter of     Esqvier          married to\r\n  married and     │ Iohn Middleton  Tho Carleton     Esqvier\r\n  had issve       │ of Middleton    of Carleton      Apprentice\r\n  by              │ Esq             Esqvi            of y^e Law\r\n                  │                                  they have iss^e\r\n                  │\r\n                  │\r\n        ┌——————┬——┴—————┬—————————┬———————————┬———┬——————┐\r\n        │      │        │         │           │   │      │\r\n  ANNE married │ GERARD LOWTHER   │ HVGH LOWTHER  │ WILLIAM LOWTHER\r\n  to Alexander │ Esq: one         │ Capitayne     │ married\r\n  Fetherston   │ of y^e Ivstices  │ in y^e voyage │ Elinor Wel-Berye\r\n  of Fetherst  │ of y^e Comon     │ of Portvgale  │ and by\r\n  Esqvire they │ Pleas in Ireland │ A Dni  is     │ Her hath\r\n  Have issue   │                  │               │  issve\r\n               │                  │               │\r\n         ┌—————┘                  │               │\r\n         │                        │               │\r\n      FRAVNCIS married       S CHRISTOPH       LANCELLOTT\r\n      to Tho:                LOWTHER Knt       LOWTHER Esqvire\r\n      Cliborne of            married Elinor    Sollicitor\r\n      Cliborne Esq           Musgrave          General\r\n      and hath               and hath          to Qveene Anne\r\n      issve                  issve\r\n\r\n “S^r Rich: Lowther Knig: succeded Hen: Lo^d: Scroope in ye office\r\n of Lo Warden of y^e West Marches, & was thrice a Commissionor in\r\n y^e grete affayres betweene England & Scotland, all in ye time of\r\n Qveene Elizabeth & after he had seene his children to ye 4th degree\r\n geven them vertuous edvcation & meanes to live advanced his brothers\r\n & sisters ovt of his owne patrimonye governed his family & kept\r\n plentifvll hospitalitye for 57 yeares together, he ended his life ye\r\n 27th of Ian: A^o Dni. 1607. Ætas. svæ 77 vttring at his last breth\r\n these verses followinge”\r\n\r\n\r\nBeneath this inscription is a plain black tablet let into the stone,\r\nwhich has, there can be no doubt, at one time borne, or been intended\r\nto bear, the verses. It is now quite black and plain, so that the\r\n“verses” Sir Richard was “vttring at his last breth” are literally\r\n“blank verse.”\r\n\r\nIn the south aisle are tablets to Colonel Lowther (grandfather of the\r\npresent Earl of Londale), 1867, and Lucy Eleanor Shorard, his wife,\r\n1848; to Elizabeth, second daughter of William, Earl of Lonsdale, 1869;\r\nto Mary, third daughter of the same earl, and widow of Lord Frederick\r\nBentinck, 1863; and to Anne, fourth daughter of the same, and widow of\r\nSir John Beekett of Sowerby, 1871.\r\n\r\nFrom Lowther Church a delightful path leads by the side of the river\r\nLowther to Askham Bridge, near which are the village Church, the\r\ncharming Rectory-house, and Askham Hall, a noble old Border stronghold,\r\nnow the residence of the Rev. Dr. Jackson, the respected and venerable\r\nProvost of Queen’s College and Rector of Lowther. Few spots in the\r\nwhole district can compare in loveliness with Askham Bridge. The\r\nrocky bed of the river—flat table rock, full of deep wide cracks—the\r\nmasses of stone hurled down upon its surface, the rich green and brown\r\nof its water, the number of fish seen disporting among the rocks, and\r\nthe rich, deeply tinted, and massive foliage by which the whole is\r\noverhung, form a picture of faultless loveliness.\r\n\r\nOf the district around Lowther we cannot say more than a few brief\r\nwords. It is, as we have already observed, a district rich in natural\r\nbeauties of mountain and lake, of hill and valley, of wood and river;\r\nbut it is also equally rich in places of historic interest and in\r\nobjects of antiquarian importance. The whole of the Lake district,\r\nincluding the two counties of Westmoreland and Cumberland, is, indeed,\r\none grand storehouse of places of note, and objects to which attention\r\nis worthy to be drawn. It is only of a few that we can speak.\r\n\r\nPenrith, one of the oldest towns of the district, with its ruined\r\ncastle, its beacon, its “giant’s grave” and other Danish or Saxon\r\nremains, its famous old grammar school, its interesting church, its\r\nplague record,[A] and its altar-piece, the exquisite work of Jacob\r\nThompson; Clifton, memorable as the scene of the battle of Clifton\r\nMoor, and where the old border stronghold, the house where the Duke\r\nof Cumberland slept, and the oak-tree under which the slain were\r\nburied, are still pointed out; Eamont Bridge, where “A welcome into\r\nCumberland” is held out as the sign of the inn on crossing the river\r\ninto that county, and close by which are the curious earth-works of\r\n“King Arthur’s Round Table” and “Mayborough;” Brougham Castle, a grand\r\nold ruined fortress, on the site of the Roman station _Broconiacum_,\r\nand the place from which Lord Brougham derives his title; Brougham\r\nHall, “the Windsor of the North,” the seat of Lord Brougham and Vaux,\r\na fine castellated mansion, with a glorious chapel, full to repletion\r\nwith Art-work of costly and elaborate character; the famous stone\r\ncircle “Long Meg and her daughters,” three hundred and fifty yards\r\nin circumference; Dacre Castle, a grand old fortress, whose owners\r\nfought at the siege of Acre under Cœur de Lion, and thus named their\r\nown stronghold now in ruins; Eden Hall, famous as the hall where is\r\npreserved the goblet called the “Luck of Eden Hall,” about which hangs\r\nso much traditional mystery, and the prophetic import of the couplet—\r\n\r\n  “If that glass should break or fall,\r\n  Farewell the luck of Eden Hall”—\r\n\r\nis implicitly believed in; Askham, of which we have already spoken;\r\nGreystoke Castle, where “Belted Will” Howard and his wife, “Bessie with\r\nthe braid apron,” lived; Shap, with its ruined abbey; Ulleswater, the\r\ngrandest of lakes—wild, lovely, and beautiful, with its banks at its\r\nmore sylvan end here and there studded with charming villas; Sharrow\r\nBay, a “home of taste,” the seat of Anthony Parkin, Esq., where Art\r\nis more happily wedded to Nature than is usually the case, and where\r\nthe views of the lake are more charming than from any other point;\r\nLyulph’s Tower; Haweswater, another exquisite lake; Hackthorpe, rich in\r\nantiquarian interest, but rendered for all time famous as the residence\r\nof one of the most gifted sons of Art, Jacob Thompson,[52] from whose\r\neasel at the “Hermitage” emanate those marvellous conceptions which\r\nhave created for him his “name and fame for all time;” Lowther village,\r\nplanned in military style, and with adjoining battery; Bampton,\r\nHelton, and a score or two other places—these are not a tithe of\r\nthe attractions which the immediate neighbourhood of Lowther Castle\r\npresents, and which are all easily visited by the stranger. Thanks to\r\nthe railway companies—to the Midland more especially, by the formation\r\nof its Settle and Carlisle line—the Lake district is opened out to\r\nthe world, and is able to be visited with real pleasure, with economy\r\nof time, with immense benefit, and with perfect comfort. By the line\r\nto which we have alluded the traveller passes along the side of one of\r\nthe loftiest of the whole ranges of mountains, and sees the country\r\nmapped out beneath him in rich profusion of wood and meadow and stream,\r\nthe towns and villages dotted about here and there, and the becks and\r\nstreams, the tarns and lakes, the rocks and mountains, opened out\r\nbefore him, charmingly diversified and rendered rich in colouring by\r\nthe ever-changing atmosphere. From London, without change, all this\r\ncan be reached by the Settle and Carlisle route, and the visitor may\r\nthus in a few brief hours be transported from the busy town life of the\r\nmetropolis into the very heart of the most lovely scenery the world can\r\nproduce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLUMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLUMBER, the seat of his Grace the Duke of Newcastle, is charmingly\r\nsituated within about four miles from Worksop, and on the borders of\r\nSherwood Forest. The drive from Worksop, up Sparkin Hill, and so along\r\nthe highway for the forest, is lovely in the extreme, the road being\r\nwell wooded on either side, and presenting glimpses of forest scenery\r\nthat are peculiarly grateful to the eye. Leaving the main road to the\r\nleft, and entering the grounds by the Lodge, a carriage drive of a mile\r\nor more in length through the well-wooded park leads to the mansion,\r\nwhich is at once elegant, picturesque, and “homely.” To it, however, we\r\nare only able to devote very brief attention.\r\n\r\nClumber is of comparatively modern erection, having been first built\r\nin 1770, and received since then many important additions. It has,\r\ntherefore, no history attached to it. The place was, till about that\r\ntime, simply a wild tract of forest land, which the then noble duke who\r\nplanned and carried out the works cleared and cultivated at an enormous\r\noutlay, forming the extensive lake at an expense of some £7,000, and\r\nerecting the mansion at a princely cost.\r\n\r\nThe main feature of the house is its west front, facing the lake: this\r\nwe have engraved. Its centre is a colonnade, and this gives access to\r\nthe entrance hall, the oldest portion of the house being a part of the\r\nshooting-box, to which magnificent additions have been made. Between\r\nthe mansion and the lake are the Italian gardens, elegantly laid out\r\nin beds of the richest flowers, and well diversified with vases and\r\nstatuary; in the centre is a fountain of large size (the bowl being\r\nnearly thirteen feet in diameter), of white marble and of Italian\r\nworkmanship.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Clumber, West Front._]\r\n\r\nThe family of Pelham, which, with that of Clinton, is represented by\r\nthe Duke of Newcastle, is of considerable antiquity in the county of\r\nHertford, deriving the name from the manor or lordship of Pelham, in\r\nthat county, which, in the reign of Edward I., belonged to Walter de\r\nPelham. He died in 1292, leaving two sons—William, who died without\r\nissue, and Walter, who was succeeded by his son, Thomas de Pelham.\r\nJohn de Pelham, the grandson of this latter, “was a person of great\r\nfame in the reign of King Edward III.; and in memory of his valiant\r\nacts, his figure, in armour, with the arms of the family on his breast,\r\nwas painted on glass in the Chapter-house at Canterbury, being (’tis\r\nprobable) a benefactor to the cathedral, or was buried there.” At the\r\nbattle of Poictiers he shared the glory of taking the French king\r\nprisoner with “Lord la Warr, and in memory of so signal an action,\r\nand the king’s surrendering his sword to them, Sir Roger la Warr,\r\nLord la Warr, had the crampet or chape of his sword for a badge of\r\nthat honour, and John de Pelham (afterwards knighted) had the buckle\r\nof a belt as a mark of the same honour, which was sometimes used by\r\nhis descendants as a seal manual, and at others the said buckle on\r\neach side a cage, being an emblem of the captivity of the said King\r\nof France, and was therefore borne as a crest, as in those times was\r\ncustomary.” The “Pelham buckle” is still the badge of the family. Sir\r\nJohn married Joan, daughter of Vincent Herbert, or Finch, ancestor of\r\nthe Earls of Winchelsea and Nottingham, and was succeeded by his son,\r\nJohn de Pelham, who was no less famous than his father for many great\r\nachievements and honourable exploits. He was Constable of Pevensey\r\nCastle, Treasurer to the King, Ambassador to the French King, and\r\nheld many other important offices, and was knighted. Dying in 1428,\r\nSir John was succeeded by his son, Sir John de Pelham, who also held\r\nmany offices. He married twice: first, Joan, co-heiress of Sir John\r\nd’Escures; and, secondly, Joan de Courcy, by whom he had issue, with\r\nothers, his son and successor, Sir John de Pelham, who married Alice,\r\ndaughter of Sir Thomas Lewknor, but died without male issue, when the\r\nestates passed to his brother, William de Pelham, who also died without\r\nissue, and was succeeded by his brother Thomas.\r\n\r\nThomas Pelham was consecutively succeeded by his sons, John and Sir\r\nWilliam, the latter of whom married, first, Mary, daughter of Sir\r\nRichard Carew; and, secondly, Mary, daughter of William, Lord Sands\r\nof the Vine, Lord Chamberlain to Henry VIII. By his first wife he\r\nhad issue, with others, a son Nicholas, of whom hereafter; and by\r\nhis second, with others, a son William, who became famous: from him\r\ndescended the Pelhams of Brocklesby. Sir Nicholas Pelham married Anne\r\nSackville, and, at his death in 1559, was succeeded by his son, Sir\r\nJohn Pelham, who married Judith, daughter of Oliver, Lord St. John of\r\nBletsoe, by whom he had a son, Oliver, who died young four years after\r\nhis father. He was succeeded by Thomas, brother to Sir John, who was\r\ncreated a baronet in 1611. He married Mary, daughter of Sir Thomas\r\nWalsingham, and was succeeded by his son, Sir Thomas Pelham, as second\r\nbaronet, who married three times, and left issue by his first and third\r\nwives. The eldest of these was his successor, Sir John Pelham, Bart.,\r\nwho married the Lady Lucy, daughter of the Earl of Leicester, by whom\r\nhe had a family of three sons and three daughters. He died in 1702-3,\r\nand was succeeded by his eldest son, Sir Thomas Pelham, Bart., who,\r\nin 1706, was raised to the peerage by the title of Baron Pelham of\r\nLaughton, in Sussex.\r\n\r\nLord Pelham married, first, Elizabeth, daughter of Sir William Jones,\r\nAttorney-General, and, secondly, the Lady Grace Holles, youngest\r\ndaughter of Gilbert, Earl of Clare, and sister of John Holles, fourth\r\nEarl of Clare, created Duke of Newcastle (who had married the Lady\r\nMargaret Cavendish, daughter and co-heiress of Henry Cavendish,\r\nsecond Duke of Newcastle), by whom he had issue two sons—Thomas and\r\nHenry—and five daughters. He died in 1711-12, and was succeeded by his\r\neldest son, Thomas, as second Baron Pelham.\r\n\r\nThis peer was born in 1693, and by the will of his uncle, John Holles,\r\nDuke of Newcastle, “was made his heir, and authorised to bear the name\r\nand arms of Holles.” Besides many other important offices, he was made\r\nSteward, Keeper, and Warden of the Forest of Sherwood and the Park of\r\nFolewood, in the county of Nottingham, and in 1714 was promoted to\r\nthe dignity of Earl of Clare and Viscount Haughton, with remainder,\r\nin default of male issue, to his brother, the Hon. Henry Pelham and\r\nhis heirs male. In the following year he was created Marquis of Clare\r\nand Duke of Newcastle, with the like remainder, and was made a K.G. He\r\nmarried, in 1717, Lady Harriet Godolphin, co-heiress of Lord Godolphin,\r\nand granddaughter of John, Duke of Marlborough, but died without issue\r\nin 1768. His brother, Henry Pelham, who had married Lady Catherine\r\nManners, daughter of the Duke of Rutland, having also died without\r\nsurviving male issue, the estates and the titles of Duke of Newcastle\r\nand Baron Pelham passed to Henry Clinton, ninth Earl of Lincoln, who\r\nhad married Catherine, daughter of Henry Pelham, and whose mother was\r\nthe Lady Lucy Pelham, the Earl assuming the name of Pelham in addition\r\nto that of Clinton. His grace had issue—Henry Pelham-Clinton, Earl of\r\nLincoln, who died during his father’s lifetime without male issue, and\r\nLord Thomas Pelham-Clinton, who succeeded to the titles and estates.\r\n\r\nThomas Pelham-Clinton, third Duke of Newcastle, was born in 1752, and\r\nmarried the Lady Anna Maria Stanhope, daughter of the second Earl of\r\nHarrington, and by her had issue two sons and two daughters. He died in\r\n1795, and was succeeded by his eldest son—\r\n\r\nHenry Pelham Pelham-Clinton, fourth Duke of Newcastle and eleventh Earl\r\nof Lincoln, who held many local appointments, and was a man of high\r\nattainments. He married, in 1807, Georgiana Elizabeth, daughter of\r\nEdward Miller Mundy, Esq., of Shipley Hall, Derbyshire, and by her had\r\nissue five daughters—viz. the Ladies Anna Maria, Georgiana, Charlotte,\r\nCaroline Augusta, and Henrietta—and six sons, viz. Henry Pelham,\r\nEarl of Lincoln (who succeeded him), and Lords Charles Pelham, Thomas\r\nCharles Pelham, William, Edward, and Robert Renebald. His grace died in\r\n1864, and was succeeded by his eldest son—\r\n\r\nHenry Fiennes Pelham-Clinton, as fifth duke. This nobleman was born\r\nin 1811, and, as Earl of Lincoln, represented South Nottinghamshire\r\nand the Falkirk burghs in Parliament. His grace, who was a man of the\r\nhighest integrity, was the confidential friend of H.R.H. the Prince of\r\nWales (who visited Clumber in 1861), was successively Lord Warden of\r\nthe Stannaries, Chief Secretary for Ireland, Secretary of State for the\r\nColonies, and Secretary of State for War. He married, in 1832, the Lady\r\nSusan Harriet Catherine, daughter of the tenth Duke of Hamilton (which\r\nmarriage was dissolved in 1850, the Duchess in 1860 being married to\r\nM. Opdebeck, of Brussels), and by her had issue three sons and one\r\ndaughter. These were—the present duke (of whom directly); Lord Edward\r\nWilliam Pelham-Clinton, born in 1836, married to Matilda, daughter of\r\nSir W. E. Cradock-Hartopp, Bart.; Lord Arthur Pelham-Clinton, M.P.,\r\nborn 1840, who died in 1870; Lord Albert Sydney Pelham-Clinton, born in\r\n1845, and married to Frances Evelyn, widow of Captain E. Stotherd; and\r\nthe late Lady Susan Charlotte Catherine Pelham-Clinton, born in 1839,\r\nmarried to Lord Adolphus Frederick Charles William Vane-Tempest, son of\r\nthe third Marquis of Londonderry.\r\n\r\nThe present head of this illustrious house, Henry Pelham Alexander\r\nPelham-Clinton, sixth Duke of Newcastle, of Newcastle-under-Lyme, and\r\nthirteenth Earl of Lincoln, was born in 1834, and educated at Eton and\r\nat Christ Church, Oxford. He sat, when Earl of Lincoln, for Newark, and\r\nwas attached to Lord Grenville’s mission to Russia in 1856. In 1861 his\r\ngrace married Henrietta Adela, only daughter of the late Henry Thomas\r\nHope, Esq., of Deepdene, Surrey, and Castle Blaney, county Monaghan (by\r\nhis wife, the Hon. Gertrude Elphinstone, daughter of the fourteenth\r\nLord Elphinstone), by whom he has issue living—Henry Pelham Archibald\r\nDouglas, Earl of Lincoln, born in 1864; Lord Henry Francis Hope\r\nPelham-Clinton, born in 1866; the Lady Beatrice Adeline Pelham-Clinton,\r\nborn in 1862; and the Lady Emily Augusta Mary Pelham-Clinton, born in\r\n1863.\r\n\r\nThe arms of the Duke of Newcastle are—quarterly, first and fourth\r\n_argent_, six cross-crosslets, three, two, and one, _sable_, on a\r\nchief, _azure_, two mullets pierced, _or_, for Clinton; second and\r\nthird, the two coats of Pelham, quarterly, viz. first and fourth\r\n_azure_, three pelicans vulning themselves, _argent_, second and third\r\n_gules_, two pieces of belts with buckles erect, in pale, the buckles\r\nupwards, _argent_ (being an augmentation in commemoration of the part\r\nSir William Pelham took in the capture of the French king at the battle\r\nof Poictiers). Crests—first, out of a ducal coronet, _gules_, a plume\r\nof five ostrich feathers, _argent_, banded _azure_, for Clinton;\r\nsecond, a peacock in pride, _proper_, for Pelham. Supporters—two\r\ngreyhounds, _argent_, plain collared and lined, _gules_.\r\n\r\nHis grace is patron of ten livings—viz. Worksop, Shireoaks, Cromwell,\r\nElksley, Bothansall, Brinsley, Markham Clinton, East Markham, Kirton,\r\nand Mapplebeck.\r\n\r\nIt will not be necessary to describe minutely any of the apartments\r\nof this “Home” of the Newcastles—Clumber. The house has been said,\r\nvery absurdly, to be “a second Chatsworth,” and that “it embraces\r\nmagnificence and comfort more than any other nobleman’s mansion in\r\nEngland;” but it is not so. It is a noble mansion, some of its rooms\r\nbeing characterized by great elegance and beauty, and by pureness of\r\ntaste, while others are of a more mediocre character. To some of the\r\napartments and their contents we proceed to direct attention.\r\n\r\nThe Entrance Hall, with an arcade supporting its ceiling, contains,\r\namong other works of Art, a semi-colossal statue of Napoleon, which has\r\nusually been ascribed to Canova, but has also, with reason, been stated\r\nto be Franzoni’s reproduction of Chaudet’s great work: it was purchased\r\nat Carrara, in 1823, by the then Duke of Newcastle. In the same hall,\r\nbesides others, are Bailey’s statue of the poet Thomson, a fine figure\r\nof Paris, and busts of the Duke of Newcastle by Nollekens, Sir Robert\r\nPeel, Cromwell, Verschaffer’s Triton and Dolphins, &c.\r\n\r\nThe Library, perhaps the finest apartment in the mansion, is a noble\r\nroom, of large size and lofty proportions, and fitted in a style of\r\ngreat magnificence. The geometric ceiling is richly decorated, and\r\naround the upper part of the room is a light and elegant gallery.\r\nBesides the choice collections of rare old books, and those of more\r\nmodern times, which are arranged round the walls of the Library and the\r\nReading-room (to which access is gained by a lofty arch springing from\r\npilasters of the composite order), they contain Sir R. Westmacott’s\r\nnoble statue of Euphrosyne, Bailey’s Thetis and Achilles, many good\r\nbronzes, and an assemblage of objects of _virtu_. From the windows\r\nof these rooms fine views of the Grounds, the Park, and the Lake are\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nThe State Dining-room, an elegant apartment, has a richly decorated\r\ngeometric ceiling and a recessed buffet, the recess being formed by\r\nwell-proportioned Corinthian columns. The rich cornice, the gilt\r\nfestoons that adorn the walls, the mirrors between the windows, the\r\nantique Venetian crystal-glass chandelier and side lights, and the\r\nsilver-gilt service on the buffets give a sumptuous air to the room,\r\nwhile the four magnificent Snyders, and the other fine old paintings\r\nwhich adorn the walls, add materially to its beauty.\r\n\r\nThe principal Drawing-room, hung with satin damask, and the furniture\r\nof the most costly and elegant character, is a noble apartment, and\r\ncontains, besides Lawrence’s portraits of the fourth Duke of Newcastle\r\nand his duchess, good examples of the Carracci, Vandyke, Castiglione,\r\nand others; while in the Crimson Drawing-room are pictures by\r\nRembrandt, Rubens, Poussin, Guido Reni, and Canaletti.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Staircase, with its iron-work railing, originally described\r\nas being “curiously wrought and gilt in the shape of crowns, with\r\ntassels hanging down between them from cords twisted in knots and\r\nfestoons,” has stained-glass windows, and is enriched with a number of\r\nportraits and other paintings. Among the portraits are Pitt, Thomson,\r\nScott, Southey, Campbell, King George II., Queen Caroline, Prince\r\nRupert, Dante, Cowley, and Hatton; and among the other paintings are\r\nexamples of Snyders, Westall, Van Oss, Andrea Sacchi, Lely, Shackleton,\r\nDiepenbeck, and others.\r\n\r\nThe other apartments—the Breakfast-room, Billiard-room, Smoking-rooms,\r\nAnte-rooms, and what not—as well as the bed-room suites, are mostly\r\nelegant in their fittings, convenient in their appointments, and\r\nreplete with choice works of Art. We, however, pass them over, simply\r\nremarking that among these Art treasures are striking examples of\r\nGainsborough (the “Beggar Boys”), Gerard Douw, Poussin, Borgognone,\r\nNeefs, Van der Meulin, Carlo Dolce (the “Marriage of St. Catherine”),\r\nVandyke, Titian, Rembrandt, Breughel, Ruysdael, Teniers, Lely,\r\nRubens (his wife), Andrea del Sarto, Salvator Rosa, Claude Lorraine,\r\nWouvermans, Hogarth (portraits of himself and wife), Reynolds, Jansen,\r\nHolbein, Van Loo, Creswick, Dahl, Domenichino, Dobson, Rigaud,\r\nCranach, Kneller, and others. Many of these are gems of Art of a high\r\norder of excellence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAt Clumber, too, are preserved four highly interesting Roman sepulchral\r\naltars, which were thus described by the Rev. Archdeacon Trollope,\r\nwith the accompanying engravings:[53]—“No. 1 bears the following\r\ninscription on the two small front panels: M. CAEDICI . FAVSTI .\r\nNEGOTIATOR . DE . SACRA . VIA . CAEDICIA . SYNTYCHE . CONLIBERTA—one\r\nthat is interesting as bearing reference to a tradesman of the\r\ncelebrated _Via Sacra_ at Rome. The birds pecking at a basket of fruit\r\nbetween them would seem to claim a Christian origin for this work of\r\nArt, had not the ox’s head and pendent sacrificial garland in addition\r\nto the heads at the angles—apparently of Jupiter Ammon—pointed to\r\nheathenism; the garland intermixed with birds, below the inscription,\r\nis both rich and graceful. No. 2 rises from an enriched plinth,\r\nbearing, first, on the pediment of its coped lid, the inscription: D.\r\nM. M. IVNI . IVNIANI, and, on a panel below, D. M. ANTONIA . TARENTINA\r\n. CONIVGI . BENE . MERENTI . FECIT, forming a short but affectionate\r\nepitaph from a wife to a husband, worthy in these respects of modern\r\nimitation. Four masks are placed at the corners of the lid, and on\r\nanother part of the lid appears a boar, for which animal Tarentum was\r\nfamous. The figures sculptured in front perhaps represent one of the\r\nfunereal games. No. 3 is a well-designed coped urn, both its form and\r\ndetails having received much careful attention. Within a long panel,\r\nsurrounded by an enriched moulding, is the inscription, TI . IVLIO\r\n. FELICI . MANNEIA . TREPTEETTI . IVLIVS . PHILONICVS . HEREDES .\r\nFECERVNT. No. 4 is a longer and lower urn than the others, having two\r\nsmall panels prepared for inscriptions, which never appear to have been\r\nfilled up. Small fanciful pillars, or candelabra, surmounted by birds,\r\nform the angles of the urn, from which depend rich garlands of fruit.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAdjoining the mansion, but apart from it, is the unfinished Chapel—a\r\ndesign of much elegance, the work of Messrs. Hine, of Nottingham—which\r\nforms a prominent and pleasing feature from the grounds and lake. It\r\nconsists of a nave and chancel, with chancel-screen and semicircular\r\napse, and has on its north side an organ loft, and on its south a\r\nsacristy; and it has an elegant bell-turret and spire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe Pleasure-grounds of Clumber are very extensive, and laid out with\r\nmuch taste. The terrace, which runs along by the lake, is of vast\r\nlength, and is beautifully diversified with statuary, vases, lovely\r\nbeds of flowers, and shrubs and trees; from it flights of steps lead\r\ndown to the lake, and other steps give access to the Italian Gardens. A\r\ngreat feature of the grounds is the enormous size and singular growth\r\nof the cedars: some of these are said to be unsurpassed in England both\r\nfor their girth and for their magnificently picturesque and venerable\r\nappearance. Some of the conifers, too, are of extraordinary size and\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\nThe Kitchen Gardens are extensive and well arranged, and the Park well\r\nstocked.\r\n\r\nThe Lake is one of the glories of Clumber. It is a splendid sheet of\r\nwater, covering some eighty or ninety acres of ground, and beautifully\r\ndiversified on its banks with woods of tall forest trees and rich\r\nverdant glades. On the bosom of the Lake rest two ships—one a fine\r\nthree-master, forming a striking feature in the view.\r\n\r\nThe neighbourhood of Clumber is rich in places of interest and\r\nin lovely localities;[54] and its near proximity to Sherwood\r\nForest—indeed, it is itself a part of that forest reclaimed—to\r\nThoresby, to Hardwick Wood, to Welbeck, to Osberton, to Worksop and\r\nits manor, to Bilhagh, to Rufford, and to a score of other inviting\r\nlocalities, renders it one of the pleasantest, most desirable, and most\r\nenjoyable of “Homes.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWELBECK.\r\n\r\n\r\nWELBECK, which we have chosen as the subject of our present chapter,\r\nhas a history, a character, an appearance, and an interest that are\r\nentirely and peculiarly its own. In its external character it differs\r\nvery materially in many points from any other mansion yet built; while\r\nits internal arrangements and means of access from one part to another\r\nare so original, and so entirely distinct from what has anywhere else\r\nbeen adopted, as at once to prove its noble owner, his Grace the Duke\r\nof Portland, by whom it has been planned, and is being carried out, to\r\nbe a man of enlarged mind, of princely ideas, of noble conceptions,\r\nof high engineering skill, and of great constructive ability. It is a\r\nplace, as we have said, entirely to itself, by itself, and of itself;\r\nit is a place many of whose features, both in general plan and in\r\nminute detail, might with advantage be taken as examples for others\r\nto follow. Vying in extent with some of the largest mansions of the\r\nkingdom, Welbeck cannot, like them, be all seen on the surface, for\r\nmany of its noblest and grandest features, and much of the finest and\r\nmost complicated parts of its constructive skill, are hidden away from\r\nthe general observer, and only flash upon him as brilliant creations\r\nof genius when he is permitted to approach them by descending into the\r\n“bowels of the earth;” then, and then only, does the magnificence of\r\nthe design of the noble owner become apparent, and then only does the\r\nvastness of the work become manifest. But of these features we shall\r\nspeak presently; first let us say a few words upon its past history and\r\nthe changes it has undergone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Welbeck, West Front and Oxford Wing._]\r\n\r\nWelbeck, with its broad domain, is situated in Nottinghamshire, about\r\nfour miles from Worksop, and close to the borders of the county of\r\nDerby. Its parks are one grand succession of fine old forest trees,\r\nand its herds of deer—for it has its herd of white deer, its herd\r\nof fallow deer, and its separate herds of red and other deer—are of\r\ngreat extent and of fine and noble quality. Before the Conquest Welbeck\r\nwas held by the Saxon Sweyn, but afterwards it passed to the Flemangs\r\nas part of the manor of Cuckney. By Thomas de Cuckney (grandson of\r\nJoceus de Flemang) the Abbey was founded, and here, in the reign of\r\nHenry II., he planted a settlement of Præemonstratensian or White\r\nCanons from Newhouse, in Lincolnshire, the first house in which they\r\nwere established in England. The Abbey was dedicated to St. James, and\r\nendowed with grants of lands. These were from time to time considerably\r\naugmented, and “in 1329 the Bishop of Ely bought the whole of the\r\nmanor of Cuckney, and settled it upon the Abbey on condition of their\r\nfinding eight canons who should enjoy the good things and pray for\r\nEdward the Third and his queen, their children and ancestors, &c.; also\r\nfor the bishop’s father and mother, brother, &c.; ‘but especially for\r\nthe health of the said lord bishop whilst he lived, and after his death\r\nfor his soul, and for all theirs that had faithfully served him or done\r\nhim any good;’ to which was added this extraordinary injunction, that\r\nthey should observe his anniversary, and on their days of commemorating\r\nthe dead ‘should absolve his soul by name;’ a process whose frequent\r\nrepetition might naturally be considered as needless, unless the pious\r\nbishop supposed that he might perhaps commit a few additional sins\r\nwhilst in purgatory.”\r\n\r\nIn 1512, it is stated, the Abbey at Welbeck was made the head of the\r\norder. At the dissolution it was granted to Richard Whalley, and\r\nlater on, after other changes, passed to Sir Charles Cavendish, of\r\nwhom we shall speak presently. By him the Abbey was converted into a\r\nnoble mansion, but little of the original religious house being left\r\nstanding, and these parts only used as cellars, or here and there a\r\nwall, for the new building. The present mansion is said to have been\r\ncommenced in 1604, and was afterwards much altered and enlarged, the\r\nriding-house being built in 1623, and the stables two years afterwards,\r\nfrom the designs of John Smithson. By the late Duke of Portland many\r\nalterations in the mansion were effected, and the grounds were also\r\nmuch improved.\r\n\r\nWe have just alluded to Sir Charles Cavendish, and this leads us on\r\nto the consideration of the descent of the estates from his time down\r\nto that of the present noble owner, and enables us to give, as is\r\nour wont, a genealogical account of the great and important families\r\nto whom Welbeck has belonged. The family of Cavendish, as already\r\nmore fully detailed in our account of Chatsworth, traces back to the\r\nConquest, when Robert de Gernon, who came over with the Conqueror,\r\nso distinguished himself in arms that he was rewarded with grants\r\nof land in Hertfordshire, Gloucestershire, &c. His descendants held\r\nconsiderable lands in Derbyshire, and Sir William Gernon obtained a\r\ngrant of a fair at Bakewell, in that county. He had two sons—Sir\r\nRalph de Gernon, Lord of Bakewell, and Geoffrey de Gernon, of Moor\r\nHall, near Bakewell. From the second of these, Geoffrey de Gernon,\r\nthe Cavendishes descend. His son, Roger de Gernon (who died in 1334),\r\nmarried the heiress of John Potton, or Potkins, lord of the manor of\r\nCavendish, in Suffolk, and by her had issue four sons, who all assumed\r\nthe name of Cavendish from their mother’s manor. These were—Sir\r\nJohn Cavendish, Chief Justice of the King’s Bench in the time of\r\nEdward III., and Chancellor of Cambridge, 4th of Richard II., who was\r\nbeheaded by the insurgents of Suffolk in that reign; Roger Cavendish,\r\nfrom whom descended the celebrated navigator, Sir Thomas Cavendish;\r\nStephen Cavendish, Lord Mayor, member of Parliament, and Sheriff of\r\nLondon; and Richard Cavendish. Sir John married Alice, daughter of\r\nSir John Odyngseles, Chief Justice of the King’s Bench, who brought\r\nto her husband the manor of Cavendish-Overhall, and by her, who died\r\nbefore him, had issue two sons—Andrew and John—and a daughter, Alice,\r\nmarried to William Nell. Sir Andrew Cavendish, the eldest son, was\r\nSheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk. By his wife, Rose, he left issue one\r\nson, William, from whom the estate passed to his cousin. Sir Andrew\r\nwas succeeded by his brother, Sir John Cavendish, Esquire of the Body\r\nto Richard II. and Henry V., who, for his gallant conduct in killing\r\nWat Tyler, in his conflict with Sir William Walworth, was knighted by\r\nRichard II. in Smithfield, and an annuity of £40 per annum granted to\r\nhim and his sons for ever. He was also made Broiderer of the Wardrobe\r\nto the King. He married Joan, daughter of Sir William Clopton, of\r\nClopton, in Suffolk, and by her had issue three sons—William, his\r\nsuccessor; Robert, serjeant-at-law; and Walter. William Cavendish, who\r\nwas a citizen and mercer of London, and of Cavendish-Overhall, married\r\nJoan Staventon, by whom he had two sons—Thomas and William. This\r\nThomas Cavendish, who was of Cavendish and Pollingford, in Suffolk,\r\nmarried Katharine Scudamore, and left by her, as son and heir, Sir\r\nThomas Cavendish, who, having studied the law, was employed by Thomas,\r\nEarl of Surrey, Treasurer of the King’s Exchequer. He was also Clerk of\r\nthe Pipe in the Exchequer to Henry VIII. He married twice, and left,\r\nby his first wife, Alice, daughter and co-heiress of John Smith, of\r\nPodbroke Hall, besides other issue, three sons—George Cavendish, Sir\r\nWilliam Cavendish, and Sir Thomas Cavendish.\r\n\r\nGeorge Cavendish, the eldest of these three sons, was of Glemsford and\r\nCavendish-Overhall, and is said to have been the author of “Cavendish’s\r\nLife of Wolsey,” although the authorship of that work has also been\r\nattributed to his brother, Sir William Cavendish. He received a\r\nliberal education, and was endowed by his father with considerable\r\nlanded property in Suffolk. His character and learning seem to have\r\nrecommended him to the special notice of Cardinal Wolsey, who “took him\r\nto be about his own person, as gentleman usher of his chamber, and\r\nplaced a special confidence in him.” George Cavendish was succeeded by\r\nhis son William, and ultimately the manor of Cavendish-Overhall passed\r\nto William Downes. Sir Thomas Cavendish was one of the knights of St.\r\nJohn of Jerusalem, and died unmarried.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Arms of Cavendish._]\r\n\r\nSir William Cavendish, the second son of the first Sir Thomas, became\r\nthe founder of the ducal House of Devonshire and of several other\r\nnoble families. He was married three times: first, to a daughter of\r\nEdward Bostock, of Whatcross, in Cheshire; secondly, to a daughter\r\nof Sir Thomas Conyngsby, and widow of William Paris; and, thirdly,\r\nto Elizabeth, daughter of John Hardwick, of Hardwick, and widow of\r\nRobert Barley, of Barley, all in the county of Derby. He was “a man of\r\nlearning and business,” and was much employed in important affairs by\r\nhis sovereigns, filling the posts of Treasurer of the Chamber and Privy\r\nCouncillor to Henry VIII., Edward VI., and Mary. At the suppression\r\nof the religious houses under Henry VIII. he was “appointed one of\r\nthe commissioners for visiting them, and afterwards was made one of\r\nthe auditors of the Court of Augmentation,” which was instituted for\r\nthe purpose of augmenting the revenues by the suppression of the\r\nmonasteries. For his services he received three valuable manors in\r\nHertfordshire, which, later on, he exchanged for lands in Derbyshire\r\nand other counties. He was also knighted by Henry VIII. By his first\r\nwife he had issue one son and two daughters who died young, and two\r\nother daughters, one of whom, Catherine, married Sir Thomas Brooke,\r\nson of Lord Cobham, and the other, Anne, married Sir Henry Baynton.\r\nBy his second wife he had three daughters, who all died young, and\r\nshe herself died in child-birth. By his third marriage with “Bess of\r\nHardwick” he had a numerous family—viz. Henry Cavendish, of Tutbury,\r\nmember of Parliament for Derbyshire, who married Grace, daughter of\r\nGeorge, Earl of Shrewsbury, but died without lawful issue; Sir William\r\nCavendish, created Earl of Devonshire, and direct ancestor of the\r\nDukes of Devonshire; Sir Charles Cavendish, of Bolsover Castle and of\r\nWelbeck Abbey, ancestor of the Dukes of Newcastle, Portland, &c. (of\r\nwhom presently); Frances, married to Sir Henry Pierrepoint, ancestor to\r\nthe Dukes of Kingston; Elizabeth, married to Charles Stuart, Duke of\r\nLennox (younger brother of Lord Darnley, the husband of Mary, Queen\r\nof Scots, and father of King James I.), the issue of which marriage\r\nwas the sadly unfortunate Lady Arabella Stuart; and Mary, married to\r\nGilbert, Earl of Shrewsbury.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Arms of Hardwick._]\r\n\r\nOf the Countess of Shrewsbury, “Bess of Hardwick,” mother of the\r\nfounder of this house, it will now be well to say a few words. The\r\nfamily to which she belonged, and of which she eventually became\r\nheiress, that of Hardwick, of Hardwick was one of considerable\r\nantiquity in the county of Derby. One of the family, William Hardwick,\r\nmarried the heiress of Goushill, of Barlborough, and by her had two\r\nsons, the eldest of whom, Roger Hardwick, married the daughter of\r\nRobert Barley, of Barley, and had issue by her, John, who married\r\nElizabeth, daughter of Henry Bakewell, of Bakewell. Their son, John\r\nHardwick, married Elizabeth Pinchbeck, of Pinchbeck, and was succeeded\r\nby his son, John Hardwick, who espoused Elizabeth, daughter of\r\nThomas Leake, of Hasland, of the same family as the Leakes, Earls of\r\nScarsdale. By this marriage John Hardwick, who died in 1527, had issue\r\none son—John Hardwick—and four daughters—Mary, Elizabeth, Alice,\r\nand Jane. The son, John, who was only three years old at his father’s\r\ndeath, married Elizabeth, daughter of Philip Draycott, of Paynsley,\r\nbut died without issue, leaving his four sisters his co-heiresses. Of\r\nthese Elizabeth, afterwards Countess of Shrewsbury, inherited Hardwick\r\nand other estates. When very young—indeed, it is said when scarcely\r\nfourteen years of age—she married Robert Barley, of Barley (son of\r\nArthur Barley, of Barley-by-Dronfield, in Derbyshire, by his wife,\r\nElizabeth Chaworth), who died a few months after marriage, leaving\r\nhis possessions to her and her heirs. By this short-lived marriage\r\nshe had no issue, and, after remaining a widow for some twelve years\r\nor so, she married, as his third wife, Sir William Cavendish, by whom\r\nshe had a numerous issue, as will be presently shown. To Sir William\r\nCavendish this remarkable lady brought not only Hardwick and the other\r\npossessions of her own family, but also those of the Barleys, which\r\nshe had acquired by her first marriage. Sir William died in 1557, and\r\na few years later his widow married, as her third husband, Sir William\r\nSt. Loe, or Santloe, Captain of the Guard to Queen Elizabeth, who\r\nsettled the whole of his estates upon her and her heirs, and thus\r\ngreatly added to her already immense possessions. By this marriage\r\nthere was no issue, and, on the death of Sir William St. Loe, she\r\nwas a third time left a widow. Soon afterwards she married, as his\r\nsecond wife (he being, of course, her fourth husband), George, sixth\r\nEarl of Shrewsbury, stipulating, however, that the Earl’s eldest\r\ndaughter, the Lady Grace Talbot, should marry her eldest son, Sir Henry\r\nCavendish, and that his second son, Gilbert Talbot (eventually Earl of\r\nShrewsbury), should marry her youngest daughter, Mary Cavendish. These\r\nfamily nuptials were solemnised at Sheffield on the 9th of February,\r\n1567-8, the younger of the two couples being at the time only about\r\nfifteen and twelve years of age respectively.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Autograph of the Countess of Shrewsbury._]\r\n\r\nThe events of the Countess of Shrewsbury’s life are so thoroughly mixed\r\nup with those of the stirring times of the kingdom at large, more\r\nespecially during the period when the truly unfortunate Mary, Queen\r\nof Scots, was in the custody of the Earl and his countess, that it is\r\nunnecessary here to enter into them. By the Earl of Shrewsbury the\r\nCountess had no issue, and he dying in 1590, she, “Bess of Hardwick,”\r\nbecame, for the fourth time, a widow. “A change of conditions,” says\r\nBishop Kennet, “that perhaps never fell to the lot of one woman, to\r\nbe four times a creditable and happy wife; to rise by every husband\r\ninto greater wealth and higher honours; to have a numerous issue by\r\none husband only; to have all those children live, and all by her\r\nadvice be creditably disposed of in her lifetime; and, after all,\r\nto live seventeen years a widow in absolute power and plenty.” The\r\nCountess, as we have before written, “besides being one of the most\r\nbeautiful, accomplished, and captivating women of her day, was,\r\nwithout exception, the most energetic, business-like, and able of her\r\nsex. In architecture her conceptions were grand, while in all matters\r\npertaining to the arts, and to the comforts and elegancies of life,\r\nshe was unsurpassed. To the old hall of her fathers, where she was\r\nborn and resided, she made vast additions, and she entirely planned\r\nand built three of the most gorgeous edifices of the time—Hardwick\r\nHall, Chatsworth, and Oldcotes—the first two of which were transmitted\r\nentire to the first Duke of Devonshire. The latter part of her\r\nlong and busy life she occupied almost entirely in building, and\r\nit is marvellous what an amount of real work—hard figures and dry\r\ndetails—she got through; for it is a fact, abundantly evidenced by\r\nthe original accounts remaining to this day, that not a penny was\r\nexpended on her buildings, and not a detail added or taken away,\r\nwithout her special attention and personal supervision. Building was a\r\npassion with her, and she indulged it wisely and well, sparing neither\r\ntime, nor trouble, nor outlay to secure everything being done in the\r\nmost admirable manner. It is said, and it is so recorded by Walpole,\r\nthat the Countess had once been told by a gipsy fortune-teller that\r\nshe would never die so long as she continued building, and she so\r\nimplicitly believed this that she never ceased planning and contriving\r\nand adding to her erections; and it is said that at last she died in a\r\nhard frost, which totally prevented the workmen from continuing their\r\nlabours, and so caused an unavoidable suspension of her works. Surely\r\nthe fortune-teller here was a “wise woman” in more senses than one,\r\nfor it was wise and cunning in her to instil such a belief into the\r\nCountess’s mind, and thus insure a continuance of the works by which so\r\nmany workmen and their families gained a livelihood, and by which later\r\ngenerations would also benefit. Besides Chatsworth, Hardwick, Oldcotes,\r\nand other places, the Countess founded and built the Devonshire\r\nAlmshouses at Derby, and did many other good and noble works. She died,\r\nfull of years and full of honours and riches, on the 23rd of February,\r\n1607, and was buried in All Saints’ Church, Derby, under a stately tomb\r\nwhich she had erected during her lifetime, and on which a long Latin\r\ninscription is to be seen.”\r\n\r\nBy her second husband, Sir William Cavendish, she alone had issue.\r\nThese were, as already detailed, Sir Henry Cavendish, of Tutbury, who\r\nmarried the Lady Grace Talbot; Sir William Cavendish, created Earl of\r\nDevonshire, from whom the Dukes of Devonshire and other lines of peers\r\nare lineally descended; Sir Charles Cavendish, the founder of the\r\nnoble House of Newcastle; Frances, married to Sir Henry Pierrepoint,\r\nancestor of the Dukes of Kingston; Elizabeth, married to Charles\r\nStuart, Duke of Lennox, and mother of Lady Arabella Stuart; and Mary,\r\nmarried to Gilbert, Earl of Shrewsbury. It is with the third of these,\r\nSir Charles Cavendish, that we have now to do.\r\n\r\nSir Charles Cavendish married Elizabeth, daughter and heiress of\r\nCuthbert, Lord Ogle, and Baroness Ogle in her own right. He left issue\r\nby his first wife, Margaret Kitson, three sons—Charles, who died\r\nan infant; William, created Duke of Newcastle; and Sir Charles, of\r\nBolsover. Dying in 1617, the estates passed to the eldest surviving\r\nson, William Cavendish, who became one of the greatest men of the age.\r\n\r\nSir William was successively created Baron Cavendish, of Bolsover, in\r\nthe county of Derby, Baron Ogle, Viscount Mansfield, Earl of Newcastle,\r\nEarl of Ogle, Marquis of Newcastle, and Duke of Newcastle, was a Knight\r\nof the Garter, and held many very important appointments. He was a\r\nstaunch Royalist, and suffered many losses and privations through his\r\nwise adherence to the royal cause. He fortified the town of Newcastle,\r\nthe Castle of Bolsover, and other places, and did good service in\r\novercoming the Parliamentarian forces at Gainsborough, Chesterfield,\r\nBradford, and many other places. His grace built the greater part of\r\nWelbeck, including the famous riding-house, yet standing, and the\r\nstables. He was the most accomplished horseman of the time, and his\r\nname will ever remain known as the author of the finest, most learned,\r\nand most extensive work on horsemanship ever written. The original MS.\r\nof this marvellous treatise is carefully preserved at Welbeck Abbey,\r\nand copies of the work, especially the first French edition, with all\r\nthe original plates, are of great rarity. He also wrote some volumes of\r\npoetry. The “Horsemanship” is particularly interesting to an historian\r\nof Welbeck, from the many plates in which views of the mansion as it\r\nthen existed are given: to these we may again refer.\r\n\r\nThe Duke was married twice. First, to Elizabeth, daughter and sole\r\nheiress of William Bassett, of Blore and Langley, Derbyshire, and\r\nwidow of the Hon. Henry Howard, third son of the Earl of Suffolk and\r\nBerkshire; and, secondly, to Margaret, daughter of Sir Charles Lucas,\r\nand maid of honour to Queen Henrietta. By his first wife the Duke had\r\nissue ten children, six sons and four daughters, of whom five died\r\nyoung.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Margaret (Lucas), Duchess of Newcastle._]\r\n\r\nThe surviving sons were Charles, who died during his father’s\r\nlifetime without issue, and Henry, who succeeded to the titles and\r\nestates; and the three surviving daughters were—Mary, married to\r\nCharles Cheney, of Chesham-Boys; Elizabeth, married to the Earl of\r\nBridgewater; and Frances, married to Lord Bolingbroke. By his second\r\nwife, Margaret Lucas, the Duke had no issue; but to this lady, who\r\nwas of rare accomplishments and virtues—“a very learned lady and\r\na philosopher”—the world is indebted for many valuable writings.\r\nForemost among these is the admirable and interesting “Life” of her\r\nhusband, the Duke of Newcastle, to which too much justice for its\r\ntruthfulness, its precision of details, and its purity of affection\r\ncannot be done. It is a “book for all time,” and to it we refer our\r\nreaders who may desire to peruse a worthy memoir of a worthy man. The\r\nDuchess died in 1673, and the Duke three years afterwards: they are\r\nburied under a magnificent monument in Westminster Abbey, where the\r\nfollowing is one of the inscriptions:—“Here lyes the Loyall Duke of\r\nNewcastle and his Dutchess his second wife, by whom he had no issue:\r\nHer name was Margarett Lucas, youngest sister to the Lord Lucas, of\r\nColchester; a noble familie, for all the brothers were valiant, and all\r\nthe sisters virtuous. This Dutchess was a wise, wittie, and learned\r\nlady, which her many books do well testifie; she was a most virtuous\r\nand a loveing and carefull wife, and was with her Lord all the time of\r\nhis banishment and miseries, and when he came home never parted from\r\nhim in his solitary retirements.”\r\n\r\nHenry, second Duke, Marquis, and Earl of Newcastle, Earl and Baron of\r\nOgle, Viscount Mansfield, Baron Cavendish of Bolsover, and Baron Bothal\r\nand Hepple, and a Knight of the Garter, succeeded his father, the first\r\nduke. He married Frances Pierrepoint, of Thoresby, granddaughter of\r\nthe Earl of Kingston, by whom he had issue three sons (only one of\r\nwhom lived) and five daughters. The son, Henry Cavendish, Viscount\r\nMansfield, married a daughter of Percy, Duke of Northumberland,\r\nwhose name he assumed, but died during his father’s lifetime without\r\nsurviving issue. The daughters were—Elizabeth, married, first, to the\r\nEarl of Albemarle, and, secondly, to the Duke of Montague; Frances,\r\nmarried to the Earl of Bredalbane; Catherine, married to the Earl of\r\nThanet; Arabella, married to the Earl of Sunderland; and Margaret,\r\nmarried to John Holles, Earl of Clare, afterwards Duke of Newcastle.\r\nThe second duke died in 1671, and the titles, in default of male issue,\r\nthen became extinct.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Arms of Holles._]\r\n\r\nBy the marriage of the Lady Margaret Cavendish with John Holles, fourth\r\nEarl of Clare, Welbeck and other estates of the Duke of Newcastle\r\npassed into his hands. In 1694 the Earl of Clare was created Duke of\r\nNewcastle. His grace died at Welbeck, through a fall from his horse,\r\nin 1711, and the title thus again became extinct. He left issue an\r\nonly daughter, the Lady Henrietta Cavendish Holles, who married\r\nEdward Harley, second Earl of Oxford and Mortimer, and thus conveyed\r\nthe Welbeck and Bolsover estates to that nobleman. The issue of this\r\nmarriage was an only daughter and heiress, the Lady Margaret Cavendish\r\nHarley, who married William Bentinck, Duke of Portland. and thus\r\ncarried the Cavendish estates into that illustrious family. She died in\r\n1785.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Arms of Bentinck._]\r\n\r\nWilliam Bentinck, the first Earl of Portland, was a member of the\r\nillustrious family of Bentinck, of Holland, and came over on his\r\nfirst visit to England as page of honour to William, Prince of Orange\r\n(afterwards King William III.), and was ambassador to this country\r\nto arrange the marriage of that prince with our Princess Mary. On\r\nthe accession of William III. William Bentinck was created Baron of\r\nCirencester, Viscount Woodstock, and Earl of Portland, and had many\r\nimportant appointments conferred upon him. He married, first, Anne,\r\ndaughter to Sir Edward Villiers and sister of the Earl of Jersey, by\r\nwhom he had issue three sons (one of whom only survived and succeeded\r\nhim) and five daughters—viz. the Lady Mary, married to the Earl\r\nof Essex, and afterwards to the Hon. Conyers D’Arcy; the Lady Anne\r\nMargaretta, married to M. Duyvenvorde, one of the principal nobles\r\nof Holland; the Lady Frances Wilhelmina, married to Lord Byron; the\r\nLady Eleanora, who died unmarried; and the Lady Isabella, married\r\nto the Duke of Kingston. His lordship married, secondly, Jane,\r\ndaughter of Sir John Temple, sister of Lord Palmerston, and widow of\r\nJohn, Lord Berkeley of Stratton, and by her had issue two sons and\r\nfour daughters—viz. the Hon. William, who married the Countess of\r\nAldenburgh; the Hon. Charles John, who married the daughter and heiress\r\nof the Earl of Cadogan; the Lady Sophia, married to Henry de Grey,\r\nDuke of Kent; the Lady Elizabeth, married to the Bishop of Hereford,\r\nbrother to the second Duke of Bridgewater; the Lady Harriette, married\r\nto Viscount Limerick; and the Lady Barbara, married to Godolphin, Dean\r\nof St. Paul’s. The Earl died in 1735, and was succeeded by his son—\r\n\r\nHenry, second Earl of Portland, who married the Lady Elizabeth Noel,\r\neldest daughter of the Earl of Gainsborough, by whom he received, with\r\nother accessions, the lordship of Tichfield and its manor-house. His\r\nlordship, who was advanced to the dignities of Marquis of Tichfield\r\nand Duke of Portland, and held many important appointments, had issue\r\nthree sons and seven daughters, whereof two sons and three daughters\r\nsurvived him. These were—William second Duke of Portland; Lord George\r\nBentinck, aide-de-camp to King George II.; the Lady Anne, married to\r\nLieutenant-colonel Paul; the Lady Anne Isabella, married to Henry\r\nMonk, Esq.; and the Lady Emilia Catherine, married to Jacob Arrant Van\r\nWassenar, a noble of Holland.\r\n\r\nWilliam, second Duke of Portland, was born in 1709, and married, in\r\n1734, the Lady Margaret Cavendish Harley, daughter and sole heiress of\r\nthe Earl of Oxford by his countess, daughter and sole heiress of John\r\nHolles, Duke of Newcastle, who thus brought the estates of Welbeck,\r\n&c., to the Bentinck family. By this union his grace had issue three\r\nsons and three daughters. These were—the Lady Elizabeth Cavendish\r\nBentinck, married to the Marquis of Thomond; Lady Henrietta Cavendish\r\nBentinck, married to the Earl of Stamford; William Henry Cavendish\r\nBentinck, Marquis of Tichfield (his successor), of whom presently; Lady\r\nMargaret Cavendish Bentinck and Lady Frances Cavendish Bentinck, who\r\ndied young; and Lord Edward Charles Cavendish Bentinck, who married\r\nElizabeth Cumberland, and had numerous issue. The Duke died in 1762,\r\nand was succeeded in his titles and estates by his eldest son—\r\n\r\nWilliam Henry Cavendish Bentinck, as third Duke of Portland. This\r\nnobleman, who was born in 1738, married, in 1766, the Lady Dorothy\r\nCavendish, only daughter of William, fourth Duke of Devonshire, and\r\nby her had issue four sons and two daughters. These were—William\r\nHenry, Marquis of Tichfield (his successor); General Lord William Henry\r\nCavendish Bentinck, Governor-General of India, who married a daughter\r\nof the Earl of Gosford; Lady Charlotte Bentinck, married to Charles\r\nGreville, Esq.; Lady Mary Bentinck; Lord William Charles Augustus\r\nCavendish Bentinck, who married, first, Miss G. A. F. Seymour, and,\r\nsecondly, Anne, daughter of the Marquis Wellesley, and divorced wife of\r\nSir William Addy; and Major-General Lord Frederick Cavendish Bentinck,\r\nwho married the Lady Mary Lowther, daughter of William, first Earl of\r\nLonsdale of the second creation, and by her, with other issue, became\r\nfather of the present Right Hon. George Augustus Frederick Cavendish\r\nBentinck, M.P. for Whitehaven, and a member of the Administration. The\r\nnoble Duke died in 1809, and was succeeded by his eldest son—\r\n\r\nWilliam Henry, fourth Duke of Portland, who was born in 1768,\r\nmarried in 1795 Henrietta, eldest daughter and co-heiress of General\r\nJohn Scott, of Balconnie, county Fife, by whom he received a large\r\naccession of property. His grace, by royal sign manual, assumed the\r\nadditional surname and arms of Scott, thus altering the family name to\r\nScott-Bentinck. By this marriage his grace had issue four sons and\r\nfour daughters. These were—William Henry Cavendish Scott-Bentinck,\r\nMarquis of Tichfield, who died unmarried during his father’s lifetime;\r\nthe Lady Henrietta; William John, Marquis of Tichfield, who succeeded\r\nto the dukedom and estates; Major Lord William George Frederick\r\nCavendish Scott-Bentinck (known as Lord George Bentinck), the eminent\r\nstatesman and patriot, who died in 1848, to whom a fine Gothic\r\nmemorial, somewhat after the manner of the “Martyrs’ Memorial,” has\r\nbeen erected by public subscription at Mansfield, from the design of\r\nMr. T. C. Hine. It bears the following inscription:—\r\n\r\n “To the memory of Lord George Frederick Cavendish Bentinck, second\r\n surviving son of William Henry Cavendish-Scott, fourth Duke of\r\n Portland. He died the 21st day of September, An. Dom. MDCCCXLVIII.,\r\n in the forty-seventh year of his age. His ardent patriotism and\r\n uncompromising honesty were only equalled by the persevering zeal and\r\n extraordinary talents which called forth the grateful homage of those\r\n who, in erecting this memorial, pay a heartfelt tribute to exertions\r\n which prematurely brought to the grave one who might long have lived\r\n the pride of this his native county.”\r\n\r\nLord Henry William Cavendish Scott-Bentinck; the Lady Charlotte,\r\nmarried to John Evelyn Denison, M.P.; the Lady Lucy, married to Lord\r\nHoward de Walden; and the Lady Mary. His grace, who was a fellow of\r\nthe Royal Society, a trustee of the British Museum, and a man of high\r\nscientific attainments, died in 1854, and was succeeded by his eldest\r\nsurviving son, the present noble head of this illustrious house.\r\n\r\nWilliam John Cavendish Scott-Bentinck, the present peer, fifth Duke of\r\nPortland, Marquis of Tichfield, Earl of Portland, Viscount Woodstock,\r\nBaron of Cirencester, and a co-heir to the barony of Ogle, was born on\r\nthe 17th of September, 1800, and represented the borough of Lynn in\r\nParliament. In 1854 he succeeded his father in the titles and estates.\r\nThe Duke, who is unmarried, is a trustee of the British Museum, and\r\na deputy-lieutenant of the county of Nottingham. His grace, who is a\r\nman of the most refined taste in all matters of Art, an accomplished\r\nscholar, and of high attainments, is patron of thirteen livings—viz.\r\nHendon, in Middlesex; Hucknall-Torkard, Sutton-cum-Lound, Cotham,\r\nKirkby-in-Ashfield, Gotham, and Sibthorpe, in Nottinghamshire; Bredon,\r\nin Worcestershire; Elsworth, in Cambridgeshire; Whitwell, Elmton, and\r\nBolsover, in Derbyshire; and Bothal, in Northumberland.\r\n\r\nThe arms of the Duke of Portland are—quarterly, 1st and 4th grand\r\nquarters, quarterly 1 and 4, _azure_, a cross moline, _argent_ (for\r\nBentinck) 2 and 3, _sable_, three stags’ heads caboshed, _argent_, a\r\ncrescent for difference (for Cavendish), 2nd and 3rd grand quarters,\r\n_or_, on a bend, _azure_, a mullet of six points between two crescents,\r\n_or_, within a bordure engrailed, _gules_ (for Scott). Crests—1st, out\r\nof a marquis’s coronet, _proper_, two arms counter embowed, vested,\r\n_gules_, on the hands gloves, _or_, each holding an ostrich feather,\r\n_or_ (for Bentinck); 2nd, a snake nowed, _proper_ (for Cavendish).\r\nSupporters—two lions, double queued, the dexter one _or_, the sinister\r\none _sable_. Motto—“Craignez honte.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Arms of the Duke of Portland._]\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Portland’s seats are—Welbeck Abbey, Nottinghamshire;\r\nFullarton House, Troon, Ayrshire; Langwell, Goldspie, Caithness; Bothal\r\nCastle, Northumberland; Harcourt House, Cavendish Square; and Hyde Park\r\nGardens.\r\n\r\nThe heir-presumptive to the titles and estates of the Duke of Portland\r\nis his grace’s cousin, Major-general Arthur Cavendish Bentinck,\r\nyoungest son of the late Lord William Charles Augustus Cavendish\r\nBentinck, brother of the fourth duke. He was born in 1819, and married,\r\nfirst, in 1857, a daughter of Sir Vincent Whitshed, Bart., who died in\r\n1858 (by whom he has a son, William John Arthur Charles James Cavendish\r\nBentinck); and, secondly, in 1862, Augusta Mary Elizabeth, daughter of\r\nthe Hon. and Very Rev. Henry Montague Browne, Dean of Lismore, by whom\r\nhe has also issue.\r\n\r\nThe earliest views of the mansion of Welbeck are those which occur\r\non the magnificent folio plates which accompany the Duke (at\r\nthat time Marquis) of Newcastle’s splendid and matchless work on\r\n“Horsemanship”[55] in 1658. The plates are all splendidly engraved from\r\nDiepenbeck’s drawings, and are among the most valuable illustrations\r\nof the period left to us. One of these plates gives a general view of\r\nWelbeck (“La Maison de Welbeck appartenant à Monseigneur le Marquis\r\nde Newcastle, le quel est dans la Province de Nottingham”), showing\r\nan extensive building four stories in height, and partly enclosed\r\nwith battlemented and other walls; the end having three gables, with\r\na central doorway, and the side of three distinct lengths. The main\r\nbuilding, that with the three gables, is four stories in height, with\r\nmullioned and transomed windows, hipped windows in the roof, and\r\nornamental clustered chimney-shafts; the next portion three stories\r\nhigh, and three windows in width, with rustic arched doorway, windows\r\nof three semicircular-headed lights, and hipped windows in the roof;\r\nand the third portion two stories in height, with a noble portico\r\napproached by steps, and an outer gateway. Of this we give a carefully\r\nreduced engraving.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Part of Welbeck in 1658._]\r\n\r\nAnother plate shows a different part of the mansion—a façade twelve\r\nwindows in length, and two stories in height; the windows transomed and\r\nmullioned, and the whole surmounted by a bold balustrade. Above the\r\nbuilding in one part rises a square tower, and in another part a larger\r\nand more ornamental tower, with a circular domed flag-turret and\r\ntall chimney-shafts. It has simply the name “Welbeck.” A third plate,\r\nwhich is extremely interesting, shows the exterior of the Riding-house\r\n(still standing, but now converted to other uses), “Le Manege couert\r\nvoute de bois large de 40 pieds, longe de 120 pieds,” and “La boutique\r\ndu Marechall,” or the house of the officer in charge of the horses.\r\nAdjoining the Riding-house is a noble sculptured Entrance Gateway. The\r\nfourth engraving is the most elaborate, and certainly most interesting\r\nof the whole. Over the main portion of the piles of buildings—that\r\nto the left, with a central and two side doors, pilastered front,\r\nseries of windows, domed circular towers, and ornamental cornice—is\r\nthe inscription, “L’Ecurie voutèe de pierre, les piliers de pierre, la\r\nmangeoire de pierre à l’Italienne, et une fontaine qui coule le long de\r\nla mangeoire, et se rend dans une voute au dessous ou coule un petit\r\nruisseau. Contre la teste de Chague Cheval il y a une petite cheminèe\r\npour l’haleine du Cheval, la quelle, s’ouvre se ferme, selon a chaleur,\r\nou froideur; Elle est parè de pierre de taille.” Over the next portion,\r\nwhich is four stories high, pilastered, and seven windows in length,\r\nis the name “Le Grenier de l’Ecurie.” Next comes the gateway with\r\nthe noble residence above it, and then the other buildings, bearing\r\nabove them the inscription, “Il y a d’autres Ecuries pour quatre-vint\r\nchevaux.”\r\n\r\nAnother plate is a fine view of the Park at Welbeck, with a noble\r\navenue of trees in the centre, and abundance of deer, with hunting,\r\nshooting, &c. It is entitled “Le Parc de Welbeck appartenant à\r\nMonseigneur le Marquis de Newcastle. Le Parc est dans la Province de\r\nNottingham.” A spirited equestrian figure of the Marquis is introduced\r\nin the foreground.\r\n\r\nThe old Riding-house of the Duke of Newcastle still stands, as we\r\nhave said, but has been denuded of its internal arrangements, and\r\nconverted to a nobler purpose. The old “bell-boxes” for horses, and\r\nthe coach-houses, which formerly occupied a considerable part of the\r\ninterior (leaving the Riding-house “longe de 120 pieds,” as named on\r\nthe engraving), have been entirely taken away, and the whole building\r\nis now one grand room, 177 feet in length by 40 feet in width, and of\r\ngreat and exquisitely proportionable height. It would form one of the\r\nfinest banqueting halls in existence. It has a massive open-work timber\r\nroof of high pitch, and of admirable design. The timber-work has,\r\nduring the course of the decorations, been all painted white, the roof\r\nitself being, with much taste, painted like a natural sky. The walls\r\nare to some height wainscoted, and the folding doors at the ends of\r\nthe apartments, as well as the walls, are, with a marvellous effect,\r\ncovered with “looking-glass,” glass of the same character adorning the\r\nside-walls. By this means a strikingly beautiful vista-like effect\r\nis produced, and the whole room is rendered charmingly delightful.\r\nFrom the roof are suspended a series of magnificent crystal-glass\r\nchandeliers, and side-lights of the same kind are arranged along the\r\nwalls. Externally the roof is covered with copper, with admirable\r\neffect, while two clock-towers add much to the general contour of the\r\nbuilding. These towers contain clocks that are marvels of constructive\r\nskill. They are thus spoken of by their maker, Mr. Benson, in his “Time\r\nand Time Tellers:”—“In a set of clock-calendars which I some time\r\nsince provided for his Grace the Duke of Portland, the clock showed\r\nthe time on four dials five feet-nine inches in diameter, chiming\r\nquarters, hours, &c. (the well-known Cambridge chimes), on bells of 12\r\ncwt., repeating the hour after the first, second, and third quarters.\r\nThe two sides of an adjoining tower show a calendar which indicates\r\non special circles of a large dial, by means of three separate hands,\r\nthe month of the year, the day of the month, and the day of the week”\r\n(needing no correction for the long and short months, nor even for the\r\nmonth of February, with its occasional twenty-nine days). It has also\r\na wind dial, lettered with the four cardinal points and the twelve\r\nintermediates; there is also an extra circle on the dial to mark the\r\nage of the moon and the equation of time, so that each dial has four\r\ncircles, besides the circle of the moon, shifted simultaneously at\r\ntwelve o’clock every night by the complicated and wonderful mechanism\r\nof its interior.\r\n\r\nAdjoining this noble room is a pile of building of exactly the same\r\nsize and character, devoted to kitchen and other domestic purposes,\r\nwith apartments over. The Kitchen is lofty, spacious, and well\r\narranged, and fitted with every possible convenience; the Servants’\r\nHall, an admirable stone groined apartment, is near; and in the larders\r\nand other offices fountains of clear water keep the air admirably\r\ncool. From the Kitchen an underground railway with an hydraulic lift\r\nis constructed for conveying the comestibles for serving in the\r\ndining-rooms.\r\n\r\nIt is not our intention to follow any regular order in briefly speaking\r\nof the different rooms of this noble and unique mansion, but simply to\r\nallude to some of them, and then to speak of the Stables, Gardens, and\r\noutside arrangements.\r\n\r\nThe Gothic Hall, a part of the old building, and altered and restored\r\nby the Countess of Oxford in 1751, is a noble apartment in the centre\r\nof the west front. The ceiling is of pendent fan-tracery of the most\r\nelaborate design, and the whole of the decorations are of Gothic\r\ncharacter, in keeping with the ceiling. Over the fire-place rises an\r\nelaborate Gothic canopy, in three arches, over the arms, with crest,\r\nsupporters, &c., of the Countess, and the letters\r\n\r\n  HC\r\n  HOM\r\n  1751.\r\n\r\nOver the doorways, beneath cusped Gothic arches, are also the arms of\r\nCavendish, with crescent for difference. This room, like every other\r\nportion of the edifice, has been greatly improved by the taste of its\r\nnoble owner, and the mechanical skill of those employed by him: this is\r\nevidenced in a remarkably ingenious and original contrivance for the\r\nraising and lowering of the sashes of the windows, and in other ways.\r\nThe suite of rooms in this pile of building consists, among others, of\r\nthe Dining-room, admirably furnished, and hung with a fine collection\r\nof paintings; the Small Drawing-room, an exquisite Doric apartment,\r\nin which, among other Art treasures, are some of the finest existing\r\nsamples of Snyders, Rembrandt’s masterly portrait of himself, and the\r\ngrand picture of St. Cecilia, as well as some sumptuous inlaid ivory\r\nfurniture; the Drawing-room, filled with the choicest of pictures and\r\nthe most superb of furniture; the Saloon, &c. From the windows of these\r\napartments, looking to the east, lovely views are obtained of the Lawns\r\nand Italian Gardens, planted with shrubs and laid out in exquisite\r\ntaste, with beds of gorgeously coloured flowers; the Lake, with its\r\nbroad expanse of water, some three miles or more in length, and with a\r\ncontour well broken by headings; the extent of Deer Park beyond (the\r\ncentral object being the grand old lime-tree shown in a portrait of the\r\nold duke); and the belt of gigantic forest trees beyond. Altogether it\r\nis a charming scene, and one that shows well the noble character of the\r\nscenery by which Welbeck is surrounded.\r\n\r\nThe “Oxford,” or “Lady Oxford’s” wing, to which another story, as well\r\nas new towers and additional rooms in length, has been added by the\r\npresent duke, forms the south angle of the mansion. The apartments in\r\nthis wing are chastely beautiful, alike in their decorations, their\r\nfurnishing, and their appointments. The walls in most cases are in\r\ndistemper, of a warm roseate tint, and the carved panelling and other\r\ndecorations are of dead and burnished gold; while the furnishing,\r\nwhether with furniture of Louis XVI. style, or of gold and figured silk\r\ndamask, or what not, is, while of costly and sumptuous character, all\r\narranged with the most faultless purity of taste. The chimney-pieces,\r\ntoo, are in good taste; they are mostly of white marble, artistically\r\ncarved in medallion heads, foliage, &c., by workmen employed at\r\nWelbeck. One fine old chimney-piece in the late duchess’s room is a\r\ngrand example of Wedgwood’s sage-green plaques inlaid in the marble. In\r\nthis Oxford wing an hydraulic lift, and every other possible appliance\r\nand convenience for the comfort of the guests, have been added; indeed,\r\nin the whole mansion nothing is left to be desired.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Welbeck, from the South-east._]\r\n\r\nThe Libraries are a suite of five superb apartments opening by wide\r\ncentral doorways one into another, thus forming one great whole. It is\r\nnot usual with us to give dimensions of rooms, but, as this suite has\r\nsome striking peculiarities connected with it, we in this instance give\r\nthem. They are, in round numbers, 43 by 38 feet, 59 by 43 feet, 59 by\r\n31 feet, 59 by 31 feet, and 58 by 31 feet. At the side of these runs,\r\non one side, a charming glass-roofed corridor of considerable width,\r\nand, on the other, an arched covered corridor of great length. The\r\nceilings of this suite of rooms are geometrically panelled and highly\r\nenriched, and the whole is lighted from the top.\r\n\r\nAdjoining these is a spacious room 158 feet 10 inches in length by 63\r\nfeet 6 inches in width, the ceiling of which is one mass of chaste and\r\nbeautiful ornamentation. Its ceiling, flat and of geometrical design,\r\nis supported on a series of eight wrought-iron girders, each weighing\r\nno less than twenty-two tons, and the whole of the light is from the\r\nceiling.\r\n\r\nThe peculiarity of the construction of these rooms—the library suite\r\nand the one last named, some stables, gardening and potting sheds,\r\nlodges, &c., as well as others in progress—is that they are entirely\r\nunderground, and are approached from, and connected with, the rest\r\nof the mansion by underground corridors and passages. The ground has\r\nbeen excavated to an enormous depth, and at a princely cost, and these\r\nlofty rooms are erected below the surface—a novelty in construction\r\nunattained elsewhere, and one that possesses many decided advantages.\r\nThe light is equal to any to be attained in buildings on the surface,\r\nand it has an additional softness that is peculiarly graceful; the\r\ndrainage is thorough and complete, the ventilation admirable, and\r\nthe annoyances of wind and of draughts entirely avoided. Verily the\r\nfairies, who in their day had their underground palaces, and\r\n\r\n  “Held their courtly revels\r\n  Down, down below,”\r\n\r\nmust have been clever and far-seeing architects, for they thus kept\r\nthemselves clear from the elements, and could enjoy the summer sun in\r\ncoolness, and the winter’s wrath in warmth. This feature of Welbeck is,\r\nindeed, like fairyland in its novelty and in its inward comforts, and\r\nits adoption was a grand conception on the part of its noble owner. And\r\nnow a few words on other portions of the arrangements at Welbeck.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Welbeck, the Riding School._]\r\n\r\nThe Riding School—the finest in existence—is a noble room, measuring\r\nin its interior no less than 379 feet in length, by 106 feet in width,\r\nand above 50 feet in height. It is covered by a semicircular and highly\r\nornate iron and glass roof, rising from iron columns, which form the\r\nside of a charming corridor running round it. This corridor has an open\r\ncarved timber-work roof, of elegant but massive design. The general\r\nidea of the design of this roof has been taken from that of the old\r\nRiding-house, but altered in its details, and rendered more elaborate\r\nand elegant: the cornice round the main building is chastely decorated\r\nwith wreaths of foliage, birds, and other objects, arranged with great\r\ntaste. The room is at night lighted by nearly eight thousand gas\r\njets, and has a strikingly beautiful effect. Near it are the Hunting\r\nStables, unequalled for amplitude of accommodation and for excellence\r\nof arrangement, with their accompanying saddle-rooms, offices, and\r\ngrooms’ barracks. These stables form a quadrangle, the yard being\r\nnearly 180 feet square, and contain some six-and-thirty spacious loose\r\nboxes and a number of stalls, the planning and arrangement of the\r\nwhole being perfection itself. Not far from these are the coach-houses\r\nand coach-house stabling, and the covered “gallop” and lunging-rooms.\r\nThese form another marked feature of Welbeck. The gallop is, in its\r\nentire interior length, 1,072 feet, and its general central width 33\r\nfeet; while the lunging-rooms at either end are about 70 feet in width,\r\nand 191 and 293 feet in length respectively. The whole of this immense\r\nspace is covered with glass, and laid down in tan, &c.; it is believed\r\nto be the finest covered gallop in existence. Besides this are outdoor\r\ntan gallops, roughing and brood boxes, &c. The Kennels are also very\r\nextensive.\r\n\r\nThe Cowyards, Cowhouses, Sheds, and Dairy are of great extent, and\r\nare arranged with every modern appliance. The Dairy, in the centre of\r\nwhich is a crystal sparkling fountain rising from a marble bowl, is\r\nunsurpassed anywhere; the floor is of Minton’s encaustic tiles, and the\r\nfittings and wall-tiles of chastely beautiful patterns. Near it are\r\nthe steward’s and other offices, the visitors’ stables, the telegraph\r\noffice, and many other buildings.\r\n\r\nThe Gardens of Welbeck are one of its great glories, so extensive, so\r\nwell arranged, so liberally provided, and so productive are they. Among\r\nthe special features—arrangements nowhere else on the same principle\r\nadopted—are the peach wall, nearly one thousand feet in length, with\r\nlean-to glass on Rendle’s patent, but so arranged, with a series\r\nof strawberry beds on the other side of the path, that they can be\r\nlifted down and run, as on a tramway, to cover the strawberries; thus\r\neach division of the lean-to forms a frame to cover a strawberry bed\r\nof its exact size. The fruit walls are built with recesses in their\r\nbacks, in which braziers of fire can be placed, so as to hasten and\r\nhelp the ripening of the fruit. The range of pine-houses is about the\r\nsame length, as are also the magnificent vineries. A pretty and novel\r\nfeature, too, is a fruit arcade. This arcade is nearly one thousand\r\nfeet in length, and is formed of a series of ornamental iron arches,\r\nand over the whole of this are trained a number of apple-trees up\r\none side, and pear-trees up the other, and bearing profusely for the\r\nwhole of this immense length. Then there are the orchard-houses, in\r\nwhich hundreds of standard peach and other trees grow in pots; the\r\npotting-houses, the pine-pits, the conservatories, the forcing-houses,\r\nthe giant mulberry-tree, and a host of other gardening attractions.\r\n\r\nAnother important part of Welbeck is the series of Workshops and\r\nYards. Here are immense carpenters’ yards and workshops, fitted with\r\nevery possible kind of machinery and every mechanical appliance—fit\r\nfor the most extensive contractor; there the extensive stoneyards\r\nand masons’ workshops; in another place the painters’ sheds and the\r\nforging-sheds; in another the smiths’ and engineers’ shops; and in yet\r\nanother the powerful steam-engines for driving the various kinds of\r\nmachinery. Here, too, are extensive gas-works, consisting of no less\r\nthan four huge gasometers; the fire-engine house, fitted with engines\r\nin constant readiness and with gear of every kind; the immensely\r\nponderous traction engines, for which his grace is so justly famous,\r\nand of which some six or seven are constantly at work; and many other\r\nmatters to which we need not allude.\r\n\r\nThe works now for many years carried on by the Duke of Portland have\r\nbeen, and yet are, of the most stupendous character, and must have been\r\naccomplished at a lavish and princely outlay. His grace has, however,\r\ndone all things “wisely and well,” and if his outlay _has_ been\r\nprincely, it has been expended in a princely manner, and to the benefit\r\nof thousands of his fellow-creatures. It is not for us, in a work like\r\nours, to moralise, but it strikes us that to enter upon and carry out\r\nlarge and important works in a liberal, energetic, and spirited manner\r\nis a far better, far higher, and far nobler way of filling a mission\r\non earth than getting rid of capital in some objectionable pursuits.\r\nThe Duke of Portland is a great benefactor to his race, and by finding\r\nemployment, as he does, to some two thousand persons or more, the good\r\nhe does is incalculable.\r\n\r\nThe collection of pictures at Welbeck is very fine and very extensive,\r\nand embraces many paintings, family portraits, and others of note\r\nand of matchless value. Among these portraits are several of the\r\ncelebrated Duke of Newcastle, of his countesses, and of his horses,\r\nwith views of Welbeck, &c.; a remarkably fine original portrait of the\r\nCountess of Shrewsbury, “Bess of Hardwick,” bearing the inscription,\r\n“Eliz: Hardwick, Daughter and Coheir of John Hardwick, of Hardwick\r\nin the County of Derby, Esq^{re.} Married to her second husband, Sir\r\nWm. Cavendishe of Chatsworth, in the same County. She settled her\r\n3rd son Charles Cavendishe at Welbeck in the County of Nottingham;”\r\na remarkably fine original portrait of Mary, Queen of Scots; an\r\nequally fine one of the Lady Arabella Stuart, by Zucchero; portraits\r\nof most of the members of the Bentinck family and their alliances,\r\nand of the Cavendish, Harley, and Holles families, besides a large\r\nnumber of general subjects. Among them may be named as a few of the\r\nmore interesting:—Elizabeth Basset, of Blore, first wife of William\r\nCavendish, first Duke of Newcastle, by Mytens, signed “Ætatis suæ\r\n25 anno 1624. D. Mytens fct.;” Sir Charles Cavendish, father of the\r\nfirst Duke of Newcastle, and his wife, Lady Ogle of Ogle, daughter\r\nof Cuthbert, Lord Ogle, by Mytens; Sir Charles Cavendish; William\r\nCavendish, first Duke of Newcastle, by Vandyke; Margaret Lucas, Duchess\r\nof Newcastle, the gifted authoress, second wife of the first Duke of\r\nNewcastle, by Lely; Henry Cavendish, second Duke of Newcastle, by\r\nLely; Elizabeth Cavendish, Duchess of Albemarle and Montague, by Lely;\r\nthe second Duke of Albemarle, by Lely; Elizabeth Cavendish and her\r\nhusband, the Earl of Bridgewater, by Lely; Henry Bentinck, Earl of\r\nPortland, and Henrietta Cavendish Holles, wife of the second Earl of\r\nOxford, by Kneller; Henrietta Cavendish Harley, Duchess of Portland,\r\nby Hudson; Edward Harley, second Earl of Oxford, by Dahl; Robert\r\nHarley, Earl of Oxford, by Kneller; Duke of Portland, by Sir Joshua\r\nReynolds; Napoleon, by Paul de la Roche; “Angel Contemplation,” by Sir\r\nJoshua Reynolds, and bequeathed by him to the then Duke of Portland;\r\nMargaret Cavendish Harley, by Michael Dahl; and another of the same, by\r\nCharles Jervas; Lucy Harrington, Countess of Bedford; Frances Howard,\r\nCountess of Essex, by Vansomer; Henry Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton,\r\nand his countess, Elizabeth Vernon, by Holbein; Henry, Prince of\r\nWales, by Zucchero; George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, by Jansen;\r\nMargaret Wooton, wife of Sir Thomas Grey, and grandmother of Lady Jane\r\nGrey, by Holbein; King Edward VI., by Holbein; the bloody-shouldered\r\nArabian horse, sent over from Aleppo by Mr. Nathaniel Harley, with\r\nfigures of the Turk and his dog, by John Wootton, 1724; Sir Francis\r\nVere, and Edward Vere, Earl of Oxford, by Mark Garrard; Robert Cecil,\r\nfirst Earl of Salisbury; Ben Jonson; Philip Herbert, Earl of Pembroke\r\nand Montgomery, by Vandyke; Sir Hugh Myddelton, by Jansen; William\r\nWentworth, Earl of Strafford, by Vandyke; Gervase Holles, son of\r\nFreschevelle Holles; Gerard Thomas Fairfax; John Holles, second Earl of\r\nClare; Sir Edward Harley; Denzil Holles, Lord Holles, by Holbein; King\r\nCharles II.; James Butler, second Duke of Ormond, by Lely; William III.\r\nin his coronation robes, and Queen Mary II., by Kneller; Lord Cornbury\r\nand lady, by Lely; Lady Ogle, Duchess of Somerset, by Kneller; William\r\nIII. when Prince of Orange, given by him to the Earl of Portland; Lady\r\nFrances Villiers, by Lely; Catherine Harley, Duchess of Buckingham,\r\nby old Zeeman; Matthew Prior, the poet, by Jonathan Richardson, and\r\nanother, by Rigaud; Charlotte Davis, Viscountess Sundon; and Queen\r\nElizabeth, by Lucas de Heere. These, however, are not a tithe of the\r\nrare and excellent pictures contained in this splendid collection,\r\nwhich our limits alone prevent us from enumerating. As an assemblage\r\nof historical and family portraits, as well as of rare examples of\r\nthe best masters, the Welbeck collection takes high rank among the\r\nchoicest private galleries of the kingdom. The collection also includes\r\nsome good ivories and a large number of valuable miniatures. Among the\r\ntreasures here preserved, too, are the original MS. of the Duke of\r\nNewcastle’s grand book on “Horsemanship,” already alluded to; a large\r\nnumber of letters from royal, noble, and celebrated personages; several\r\npatents of creation; a MS. account of the regalia, jewels, plate, &c.,\r\nof Henry VIII., signed in several places by that monarch; some curious\r\nMS. inventories; and many other matters of historical value.\r\n\r\nWelbeck formerly had its share of royal visits, and of these some\r\ncurious accounts are given in the Duchess of Newcastle’s “Life” of her\r\nhusband. Thus—“When his Majesty (Charles I.) was going into Scotland\r\nto be crowned, he took his way through Nottinghamshire; and lying at\r\nWorksopp-Mannor, hardly two miles distant from _Welbeck_, where my\r\nLord then was, my Lord invited His Majesty thither to a Dinner, which\r\nhe was graciously pleased to accept of: this entertainment cost my\r\nLord between Four and Five thousand pounds; which His Majesty liked so\r\nwell, that a year after His Return out of _Scotland_, He was pleased\r\nto send my Lord word, that Her Majesty the Queen was resolved to make\r\na Progress into the Northern parts, desiring him to prepare the like\r\nEntertainment for Her, as he had formerly done for Him: Which my Lord\r\ndid, and endeavour’d for it with all possible Care and Industry,\r\nsparing nothing that might add splendor to that Feast, which both Their\r\nMajesties were pleased to honour with their Presence. _Ben Jonson_ he\r\nemployed in fitting such Scenes and Speeches as he could best devise;\r\nand sent for all the Gentry of the Country to come and wait on their\r\nMajesties; and in short, did all that ever he could imagine, to render\r\nit Great and worthy Their Royal Acceptance. This Entertainment he made\r\nat _Bolsover Castle_, in Derbyshire, some five miles distant from\r\n_Welbeck_, and resigned _Welbeck_ for Their Majesties Lodging; it cost\r\nhim in all between Fourteen and Fifteen thousand pounds. Besides these\r\ntwo, there was another small Entertainment which my Lord prepared for\r\nHis late Majesty, in his own Park at _Welbeck_, when his Majesty came\r\ndown, with his two Nephews, the now Prince Elector Palatine, and His\r\nBrother Prince _Rupert_, into the Forrest at _Sherwood_, which cost him\r\nFifteen hundred pounds. And this I mention not out of a vain-glory, but\r\nto declare the great love and Duty my Lord had for His Gracious King\r\nand Queen, and to correct the mistakes committed by some Historians,\r\nwho not being rightly informed of those Entertainments, make the World\r\nbelieve Falsehood for Truth.” The first of Ben Jonson’s masques here\r\nalluded to was entitled “Love’s Welcome. The King’s entertainment at\r\nWelbeck, in Nottinghamshire, a house of the Right Honourable William,\r\nEarl of Newcastle, Viscount Mansfield, Baron of Bothal, Bolsover, &c.,\r\nat his going into Scotland, 1633.” It was one of the best of Jonson’s\r\nmasques, and the quintain was introduced and performed by gentlemen of\r\nthe county in the garb of rustics.\r\n\r\nAnd now it only remains to say a word or two as to the surroundings of\r\nWelbeck.\r\n\r\nWelbeck Park, and the closely adjoining forest of Sherwood, have ever\r\nbeen noted for their fine venerable trees—oaks that have stood for\r\nages, and bid fair to stand for ages yet to come. Many of the then\r\nfine old trees were cut down “by the rebels” when Welbeck became for\r\na time their prey during the civil wars, but many still remained; and\r\nthose then in their prime have now become more venerable with age. A\r\nfew of the more noted may just be named. The “Duke’s Walking-stick,” so\r\ncalled from its long straight stem, when described in 1813, and earlier\r\nby Major Rooke, who considered it to be unmatched in the kingdom,\r\nmeasured 111 feet 6 inches in height, was estimated to weigh about 11\r\ntons, and contained about 440 solid cubic feet of timber. It no longer\r\nexists, but another tree, a “young walking-stick,” we are informed,\r\nof nearly a century and a half’s growth, is about 100 feet in height.\r\nThe “Two Porters,” standing a little distance apart, and named “the\r\nPorters” from a gate and fence having formerly stood between them,\r\nare described as being about 98 and 88 feet in height, and 38 and 34\r\nfeet in circumference; they stand nearly at the north extremity of the\r\npark, not far from the south lodge of Worksop Manor, and are marvels of\r\ngrowth and girth.\r\n\r\nThe “Seven Sisters,” situated about half a mile from the “Two Porters,”\r\nis one of the most remarkable trees anywhere in existence. It consisted\r\noriginally of seven stems springing from one general root, and\r\nrising perpendicularly to a great height—no less than 88 feet, the\r\ncircumference of the common trunk close to the ground being over 30\r\nfeet. Some of the sister stems have from time to time been blown down,\r\nbut the tree is still a noble and interesting one. Near it “a hollow\r\ntree, in circumference 20 feet 9 inches, supposed to be three hundred\r\nyears old, was used as a place of concealment from whence the keeper\r\ncould aim at the deer.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Greendale Oak._]\r\n\r\nThe “Ruysdael Oak,” so called because of being in form and condition\r\none of those peculiar trees which that painter delighted to introduce\r\ninto his pictures, stands on a commanding eminence in the park, not far\r\nfrom the “Seven Sisters,” and forms a striking object from whichever\r\nside it is seen. Venerable in its age, lovely in its decay, this\r\n“grand old oak” stretches out its weird-like naked branches in every\r\ndirection, and forms a landmark that cannot be mistaken. From it, and,\r\nindeed, from many points on this side of the park, some strikingly\r\nbeautiful views of the mansion, the lake, and the grounds are obtained.\r\n\r\nIn the part of the grounds known as “The Wilderness;” in the various\r\ndrives that intersect the forest; in the remains of “Merrie Sherwood,”\r\nwhich form a part of the estate; and, indeed, in every direction, noble\r\noaks many centuries old, limes of marvellous beauty, and chestnuts of\r\nenormous growth are abundant, and give an air of unsurpassed grandeur\r\nto the domain. There is also, in another part of the grounds, a fine\r\navenue of aged oaks.\r\n\r\nThe “Greendale Oak” is, however, of all trees, the most curious,\r\nvenerable, and interesting. It lies some half a mile south of the\r\nAbbey, and is computed to be one of the oldest trees in existence in\r\nthis country. Throsby, in his “Thoroton,” supposed it to be, when he\r\nwrote, “upwards of 1,500 years old,” and Major Rooke, a few years\r\npreviously, that it was “thought to be above seven hundred years old;”\r\nthus opinions of contemporary people varied some eight hundred years in\r\ntheir computations. “In Evelyn’s time it was 33 feet in circumference\r\nat the bottom; the breadth of the boughs was 88 feet, covering a space\r\nequal to 676 square yards.” In 1724, the opening, from decay, in the\r\nstem of the tree was enlarged sufficiently to allow of the passage of\r\nan ordinary carriage, or three horsemen abreast. Through this opening\r\none of the noble owners is said, with his bride, to have been driven\r\nin a carriage drawn by six horses, on the occasion of his marriage.\r\nThe tree has been repeatedly engraved, one old plate representing the\r\ncarriage being driven through the opening, and another representing a\r\nhorseman passing through it. In 1727 the Countess of Oxford, the then\r\nowner of Welbeck, had a cabinet made from a portion of the wood taken\r\nout of the opening. It is inlaid with representations of the carriage\r\nand six horses passing through the tree, and other designs, and bears\r\nthe following quotation from Ovid:—\r\n\r\n  “Sæpe sub hac Dryades festas duxure choreas\r\n  Sæpe etiam manibus nexis ex ordine trunci,\r\n  Curcuiere modum mensuraque roboris ulnas.\r\n  Quinque ter implebat. Nec non et cætera lentum\r\n  Silva sub hac omnis, quantum fuit herba sub omni;”\r\n\r\nand Chaucer’s lines—\r\n\r\n  “Lo the Oke! that hath so long a norishing\r\n  Fro the time that it ginneth first to spring,\r\n  And hath so long a life, as we may see,\r\n  Yet, at the last, wasted is the tree.”\r\n\r\nThe Greendale Oak, the “Methuselah of trees,” still stands, and is\r\npreserved with religious care. Long may this “brave old oak” remain one\r\nof the landmarks of past ages at lordly Welbeck!\r\n\r\nLong, too, may the “Parliament Oak,” where Edward I. summoned his\r\nParliament to meet him; the “Shamble Oak,” where Robin Hood and his\r\n“merry, merry men, all under the greenwood tree,” hung their deer, but\r\nwhich has lately been nearly destroyed by fire; the “Major Oak,” the\r\n“Simon Forester Oak,” and their brethren, be spared to us, and remain\r\nas landmarks of history and of tradition!\r\n\r\nThe neighbourhood of Welbeck is rich in historical associations, in\r\nobjects of interest, and in places of note. Sherwood Forest, with its\r\nhero-lore of Robin Hood; Clipstone, with its grand old Park; Clumber,\r\nwith its noble mansion; Worksop, with its Manor House, its Abbey\r\nChurch, its grand old gateway, and its other attractive features;\r\nThoresby, with its palatial Hall; Bolsover, with its grand old Castle;\r\nand Steetley, with its Saxon Church: these are but a few, a very few,\r\nof the places that lie around and invite a visit; but these we must\r\npass over, and, for a time, bid adieu to Welbeck and its charms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abbey of Welbeck, 1326.\r\n\r\n  Adam, Robert, 1101.\r\n\r\n  Agincourt, Battle of, 1188.\r\n\r\n  Albini, Family of, 1003 _et seq._\r\n\r\n  Allin, Family of, 1206 to 1209, 1220;\r\n    Admiral, 1207, 1208, 1220.\r\n\r\n  Anagram of Charles I., 1189.\r\n\r\n  Anguish, Family of, 1208, 1220.\r\n\r\n  Anne of Cleves, 1152.\r\n\r\n  “Arcadia,” Sidney’s, 1235.\r\n\r\n  Archer,1267.\r\n\r\n  Armada, Spanish, 1036, 1114.\r\n\r\n  Arms of Manners, 1001, 1006, 1009, 1014;\r\n    De Todeni, 1003;\r\n    De Albini, 1003;\r\n    De Ros, 1003;\r\n    Duke of Rutland, 1001, 1009, 1014;\r\n    Duke of Sutherland, 1033, 1042;\r\n    Leveson, 1042;\r\n    Earl Delawarr, 1064;\r\n    Gower, 1042;\r\n    Howard, 1082;\r\n    Earl of Carlisle, 1082;\r\n    Brotherton, 1082;\r\n    Curzon, 1099;\r\n    Warren, 1082;\r\n    Lord Scarsdale, 1099, 1100;\r\n    Mowbray, 1082;\r\n    Leake, 1100;\r\n    Cecil, 1140;\r\n    Dacre, 1082;\r\n    Neville, 1121;\r\n    Greystock, 1082;\r\n    Lord Braybrooke, 1121;\r\n    Earl of Stamford, 1128, 1140;\r\n    Pakington, 1160, 1166, 1171, 1181;\r\n    Coke, 1189;\r\n    Lord Hampton, 1160, 1166, 1171, 1181;\r\n    Lord Palmerston, 1193;\r\n    Earl Cowper, 1194;\r\n    Jernegan, 1205;\r\n    Allin, 1208;\r\n    Anguish, 1209;\r\n    Crossley, 1212;\r\n    Earl of Pembroke, 1229;\r\n    Duke of Cleveland, 1254, 1255;\r\n    Vane, 1254;\r\n    Fitzroy, 1254;\r\n    Duke of Westminster, 1275;\r\n    King Edward the Confessor, 1275;\r\n    Lucas, 1292;\r\n    Lowther, 1297;\r\n    Grosvenor, 1275;\r\n    Earl of Lonsdale, 1295;\r\n    Clinton, 1322;\r\n    Pelham, 1322;\r\n    Cavendish, 1331, 1341;\r\n    Hardwick, 1332;\r\n    Holles, 1337;\r\n    Bentinck, 1338, 1341;\r\n    Duke of Portland, 1341;\r\n    Scott, 1341.\r\n\r\n  Arne, Dr., 1272.\r\n\r\n  Arundel Marbles, 1232.\r\n\r\n  Audley End, 1112 to 1127;\r\n    Family of Audley, 1112 to 1121;\r\n    Family of Howard, 1112 to 1121;\r\n    Neville Family, 1119 to 1121;\r\n    History of, 1121 to 1126;\r\n    Pepys’s Visits to, 1122 to 1125;\r\n    Grounds, 1126, 1127.\r\n\r\n  Audley, Lords, 1112 to 1127.\r\n\r\n  Axminster Carpets, 1238, 1239.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ballad of the Spanish Lady, 1035;\r\n    Henry V. and the King of France, 1188;\r\n    Lord of Burleigh, 1136;\r\n    Luck of Eden Hall, 1315.\r\n\r\n  Bath, 1026.\r\n\r\n  Baths, Kedleston, 1107;\r\n    Harrogate, 1108;\r\n    Quarndon, 1108;\r\n    Droitwich, 1185.\r\n\r\n  Baxter, Richard, 1197.\r\n\r\n  “Belted Will,” 1076.\r\n\r\n  Belvoir Castle, 1001 to 1031;\r\n    Situation, 1001;\r\n    History of, 1017;\r\n    Families of Ros, Manners, &c., 1003 to 1014;\r\n    Witches of, 1014 to 1017;\r\n    Description of, 1018 to 1023;\r\n    Gardens and Grounds, 1023 to 1030;\r\n    Neighbourhood of, 1030.\r\n\r\n  Belvoir Monastery, 1003.\r\n\r\n  Bentinck, Family of, 1338 to 1341;\r\n    Lord George, 1340.\r\n\r\n  “Bess of Hardwick,” 1227, 1334, 1335, 1350.\r\n\r\n  Boleyn, Anne, 1065, 1146 to 1159;\r\n    Family of, 1146 to 1159.\r\n\r\n  Bottesford, 1017, 1030, 1031.\r\n\r\n  Bourbon, John, Duke of, at Melbourne, 1188.\r\n\r\n  Braybrooke, Baron, 1119 to 1127.\r\n\r\n  Briggs, J.

with the laying out of\r\nthe grounds.\r\n\r\n[2] “Alton Towers and Dove-Dale.” By Llewellynn Jewitt, F.S.A. (Black\r\nand Co.) The Roman Catholic establishment just referred to is close\r\nto the pretty little town of Alton, in which the visitor will find an\r\nexcellent and comfortable inn (the “White Hart”). The intention of\r\nthe founder, and of the architect, Pugin, in the establishment of the\r\npicturesque pile of buildings referred to, was to found an institution,\r\nlecture-hall, schools, &c., for the town of Alton; a large cloistered\r\nestablishment for nuns, a chapel, and a hospital for decayed priests.\r\nThe chapel alone is finished, and in it service is regularly performed\r\nby a resident priest, who lives in one part of the monastic buildings.\r\nThe schools, too, are in use, and the building erected as a residence\r\nfor the master is used as a small nunnery. In the chapel, which is\r\nelegantly fitted up, are buried John, Earl of Shrewsbury, the founder\r\nof the hospital, who died in 1852; his Countess (Maria Theresa), who\r\ndied in 1856, to each of whom are splendid monumenta\r\n\r\n[3] Jewitt’s “Alton Towers and Dove Dale.”\r\n\r\n[4] Parts of this account are borrowed from Mr. S. C. Hall’s\r\ndescription of Cobham, printed in 1848 in the “Baronial Halls.” During\r\nthe summer of 1867, Mr. Hall revisited the venerable mansion, its\r\ngardens and park, with the members of the Society of Noviomagus.\r\n\r\n[5] “Cobham, anciently Coptham; that is, the head of a village, from\r\nthe Saxon _copt_, a head.”—PHILIPOT. _Survey of Kent_.\r\n\r\n[6] Sir Thomas Broke and Joan de Cobham, his wife, had ten sons and\r\nfour daughters. It is their tomb which occupies so prominent a position\r\nin the chancel of Cobham Church.\r\n\r\n[7] Under a most iniquitous sentence, Raleigh was executed fifteen\r\nyears after it was pronounced; and Cobham (by whose treachery the brave\r\nknight was chiefly convicted) had been a houseless wanderer meanwhile,\r\nperishing unpitied and unwept. Of their intimacy there is no doubt;\r\nand it is more than probable, that the old Hall we are describing was\r\noften the home of Sir Walter Raleigh when conspicuous as “the noble\r\nand valorous knight.” It is grievous to think that so great a “worthy”\r\nshould have been sacrificed to the pitiful cowardice of so “poor a\r\nsoul” as the last of the Cobhams—the degenerate scion of a munificent\r\nand valorous race.\r\n\r\n[8] Sir Joseph Williamson was the son of a clergyman of Cumberland. He\r\nheld various appointments under the Crown, was President of the Royal\r\nSociety, and was buried in Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\n[9] “Lady Katherine O’Brien died in November following; upon which\r\nher two-thirds of this manor and seat, which, with the rest of\r\nthe estates of the late Duke of Richmond, purchased by Sir Joseph\r\nWilliamson, descended to Edward, Lord Clifton and Cornbury (son of\r\nEdward, Lord Cornbury, afterwards Earl of Clarendon, and Catherine his\r\nwife, the only daughter and heir of the said Lady Katherine, by her\r\nfirst husband, Henry Lord O’Brien), and on his death, without issue,\r\nin 1713, to his only surviving sister and heir, the Lady Theodosia\r\nHyde.”—HASTED’S _Kent_.\r\n\r\n[10] In 1718 Sir Richard Temple, Bart., was created Baron and Viscount\r\nCobham (the Temples, it appears, being in the female line connected\r\nwith the Brokes), and this title is still held and enjoyed by his\r\ndescendant the present Duke of Buckingham, K.G., whose titles are Baron\r\nCobham, of Cobham in Kent; Viscount Cobham of the same place; Earl\r\nNugent (in the peerage of Ireland); Earl Temple; Marquis of Chandos,\r\nMarquis of Buckingham, and Duke of Buckingham.\r\n\r\n[11] The architect is C. F. Hayward, F.S.A. It is a handsome building,\r\nimmediately fronting the Terminus, of a style which may be described\r\nas a free treatment of Gothic architecture, without any of the special\r\ncharacteristics which refer to one particular date—in fact, it is\r\na modern design, well adapted to its purposes and position, and of\r\nsubstantial build, being of granite and limestone—combined with\r\nlightness and even elegance in certain details of terra-cotta work,\r\nfrom the well-known manufactory of Blashfield of Stamford.\r\n\r\nFrom the lantern tower of the hotel, rising far above the buildings\r\nnear, and also from some of the windows in the upper floor, is to be\r\nobtained a magnificent view of the Sound, with the near Breakwater, and\r\nthe Eddystone Lighthouse, “far out at sea;” while the grassy slopes of\r\nlovely Mount Edgcumbe and its tree-capped heights are seen to rise in\r\nfront, overhanging the land-locked harbour, called Hamoaze.\r\n\r\n[12] The grounds are on Mondays freely open to all comers; but on any\r\nday visitors will be admitted to them by application at the Manor\r\nOffice, Stonehouse, near to the ferry by which passengers are conveyed\r\nacross. There is, however, a road for carriages; but that implies a\r\ndrive of twelve miles there and twelve miles back, besides the drive of\r\nfive or six miles round the Park.\r\n\r\n[13] The date of the erection of Maker Church is not known. It was\r\noriginally dedicated to St. Julian, and there is a well near the church\r\nstill designated St. Julian’s well.\r\n\r\n[14] The name of Cothele is conjectured to be hence derived: _coit_\r\nbeing a wood in ancient Cornish, and _hel_ a river: the wood by the\r\nriver, or, in a mixture of British and Old English, the hall in the\r\nwood, _healle_ being a hall or manor-house. The name occurs in many\r\nvery ancient records, _temp._ Henry III., “William Cothele engages\r\nto defend by his body, _in duel_, the right of Roger de Wanton and\r\nKaterine, his wife, to lands in Somerset against William de Deveneys.”\r\n\r\n[15] It is now the residence of the Dowager Countess Mount-Edgcumbe,\r\nwho, we rejoice to know, cherishes every portion of the venerable\r\nmansion, with its decorations and contents. It is made thoroughly\r\ncomfortable, yet without in the slightest degree impairing its\r\n“natural” character; scarcely, indeed, displacing a single relic of\r\nantiquity, of which every room contains some singular, interesting,\r\nand often beautiful, examples. The people are admitted freely to the\r\nwoods and grounds; and parties visit there nearly every day—a steamboat\r\nrunning daily, in summer, up the Tamar, from Plymouth.\r\n\r\n[16] Carew describes the building as “_auncient_, large, strong, and\r\nfaire;” he was born in 1555, and wrote before 1600; and would scarcely\r\nhave described a building as “auncient,” which had been erected only\r\na century before his time. He describes also the chapel as “richly\r\nfurnished by the devotion of times past.”\r\n\r\n[17] At Watcombe, a pretty village two miles from Torquay, there has\r\nrecently been established a manufactory of works in terra-cotta.\r\nThey originated in the discovery of clay of remarkable fineness and\r\ndelicacy, and beauty of colour. The productions issued by the works\r\nare of great excellence in design and execution: they are deservedly\r\npopular.\r\n\r\n[18] For several of the engravings that are introduced into the\r\nfollowing papers upon Alnwick Castle we desire to tender our best\r\nthanks to his Grace the Duke of Northumberland; they were originally\r\nprinted in a history of the illustrious family of the Percies, of which\r\na few copies were presented to private friends.\r\n\r\n[19] Thus writes one of the Lords Wardens, _temp._ Eliz.: “God blessed\r\nme so well in all my designs as I never made journey in vain, but did\r\nwhat I went for;” _i.e._, “hanging or heading.”\r\n\r\n[20] The name of Alnwick has been variously spelt at different periods.\r\nThus, among other ways, it has been spelt Alnawic, Alnewyke, Alnewyc,\r\nAlnewick, Annwik, Annewic, Annewyke, Anwik, Anwick, &c. Formerly it\r\nappears to have been pronounced with the Scotch twang, _An-ne-wick_,\r\nas though spelt in three syllables. It is now by all natives of the\r\nplace called Annick. _Aln_ (the name of the river), like the names of\r\nour rivers, hills, and mountains, is Celtic, or ancient British, and\r\nwas given by one of the earliest tribes settling in Britain; for in\r\nHiberno-Celtic we have _Alain_, signifying white, bright, or clear.\r\nAlnwick (_wick_ being a street, village, or dwelling-place), therefore,\r\nis the town on the bright clear river.\r\n\r\n[21] The first Sir Hugh Smithson died in 1670: he had a nephew who was\r\na physician in Sussex, and spent almost all his fortune also in the\r\nroyal cause. His son again was a physician, and practised in London,\r\nand married a daughter of Sir Edward Walpole, of Lincolnshire. The fact\r\nof these two collaterals being medical men, probably gave rise to the\r\nstory of Sir Hugh having been brought up to be an apothecary.\r\n\r\n[22] Mr. Burrell had four daughters, of whom the eldest married\r\nCaptain Bennett, R.N.; the second married Lord Algernon Percy,\r\nsecond son of the first duke, and was grandmother of the present\r\nDuke of Northumberland; the third sister was the second Duchess of\r\nNorthumberland; and the youngest sister married, first, the Duke of\r\nHamilton, and, secondly, the Marquess of Exeter. Mr. Burrell’s only\r\nson married a peeress in her own right, and was himself created Baron\r\nGwydyr.\r\n\r\n[23] Minute and most faithful descriptions of the restorations at\r\nAlnwick Castle are given by Mr. George Tate, F.G.S., of Alnwick, in his\r\ncopious and excellent “History of the Borough, Castle, and Barony of\r\nAlnwick,” a work which does honour to the literature, not of the north\r\nonly, but of England, and will always be highly esteemed as a valuable\r\ncontribution to that important department of the national literature\r\nwhich comprehends our topographical histories.\r\n\r\n[24] There is, however, one of comparatively recent date, built on the\r\nsite of the ancient gate: it is still called the Potter Gate.\r\n\r\n[25] The fine five-light east window of St. Paul’s Church is filled\r\nwith some of the most remarkable stained glass in England; it was\r\nexecuted by Max Ainmüller at Munich, in 1856, from cartoons designed\r\nand drawn by Mr. Dyce, R.A., and is a memorial window erected by public\r\nsubscription to commemorate the noble founder of the church.\r\n\r\n[26] While serving in the Crusade under Richard, Earl of Cornwall,\r\nRalph Fulborne visited the friars who were then established upon Mount\r\nCarmel; and attracted, it is said, by their piety and holy lives, he\r\nbrought back with him to his Northumbrian home some of the Carmelite\r\nbrethren, and built them a house in his own land, which might serve in\r\nsome degree to remind them of their Syrian Carmel: for at Hulne they\r\nfound a hill, with a river flowing at the foot of it, and around was a\r\nforest, just as a forest had surrounded them when far away in the East.\r\n\r\n[27] The park and grounds are always freely open to “the people,” and,\r\non stated occasions, parts of the castle. This is a boon of magnitude,\r\nnot only to the inhabitants of the town and district, but to many who\r\ncome from far distances to obtain free air and healthful recreation\r\nfrom Nature where her aspect is most cheering and her influence most\r\ninvigorating. On the 20th of August, 1868, on arriving at the Alnwick\r\nStation, we met upwards of 2,000 men, women, and children, who had\r\nbeen enjoying a day in the Park. It was the annual pic-nic of persons\r\nemployed by the Jarrow Chemical Works (Newcastle-on-Tyne), they were\r\naccompanied, not only by the overseers, but the partners of the firm. A\r\nmore orderly crowd it would have been impossible to have met anywhere.\r\n\r\n[28] A further notice of Hobbes and his works will be found in our\r\naccount of Chatsworth, on a subsequent page.\r\n\r\n[29] In Domesday it is stated that in the time of King Edward the\r\nConfessor the Castle of Arundel yielded 40_s._ for a mill, 20_s._ for\r\nthree feasts, and 20_s._ for a pasture. This is of itself sufficient\r\nevidence of the high antiquity—going back to Saxon times—of the Castle\r\nof Arundel.\r\n\r\n[30] It is a curious fact that the ground-rents accruing from streets\r\nin the Strand, London—Arundel and Norfolk Streets—are still devoted to\r\nthe improving and repairing of Arundel Castle. In 1786, considerable\r\narrears being due, the tenants were called upon to pay them; but\r\nrefused, unless it were agreed to devote them, according to ancient\r\ntenure, to such improvements and repairs. The then Duke of Norfolk was\r\ncompelled to yield a matter in serious dispute; and the result was a\r\nthorough restoration of the venerable castle, which, up to that time,\r\nhad been almost such a ruin as it was left by Sir William Waller during\r\nthe war between the King and the Parliament. It is said that in these\r\nrestorations, between the years 1786 and 1816, no less a sum than\r\n£600,000 was expended.\r\n\r\n[31] In 1863 Penshurst was visited by the Kent and Sussex Archæological\r\nSociety, when Mr. Parker, of Oxford (to whom archæology owes a large\r\ndebt of gratitude), read a paper descriptive of the seat of the\r\nSidneys. From that paper we shall quote:—“Mr. Parker said that in the\r\ntime of William the Conqueror there was a house of importance in that\r\nplace, occupied by a family named after it, Penchester (the castle on\r\nthe hill), which showed that the house was fortified at that time,\r\ndoubtless according to the fashion of the age, with deep trenches and\r\nmounds and wooden palisades, as represented in the Bayeux tapestry;\r\nand the house within the fortifications must have been a timber house,\r\nbecause if a Norman keep had been there built, there would certainly be\r\nsome remains of it.”\r\n\r\n[32] To the park and to the several state rooms the public are on\r\nfixed days freely, graciously, and most generously admitted; and the\r\nhistory of the several leading attractions is related by attentive and\r\nintelligent custodians.\r\n\r\n[33] Dr. Waagen writes thus of this marvellous work of the great\r\nmaster:—“There is in these features a brutal egotism, an obstinacy,\r\nand a harshness of feeling such as I have never yet seen in any human\r\ncountenance. In the eyes, too, there is the suspicious watchfulness of\r\na wild beast, so that I became quite uncomfortable from looking at it\r\nfor a long time; for the picture, a masterpiece of Holbein, is as true\r\nin the smallest details as if the king himself stood before you.”\r\n\r\n[34] It is a pretty legend—and one to which we direct the attention\r\nof artists—that while Guy was doing penance as a hermit, his lady was\r\nmourning his absence, and praying for his return at the castle. It was\r\nher daily custom to bestow alms upon the suffering, sorrowful, and\r\nneedy; and dole was, among others, frequently given to the husband by\r\nthe unconscious wife. He was dying at length, and then made himself\r\nknown to her by the transmission of a ring. So she watched, and prayed,\r\nand comforted, beside his death-bed, surviving him but fourteen days;\r\nand they were both buried in the cave where the poor penitent had lived\r\nand died.\r\n\r\n[35] For an account of this stained glass see the “Archæological\r\nJournal,” No. 84.\r\n\r\n[36] The bridge was erected at the commencement of the present century\r\nby George Greville, Earl of Warwick. It is a single arch, forming the\r\nsegment of a circle, 105 feet in span.\r\n\r\n[37] A very pretty little book, entitled “The Peacock at Rowsley,”\r\nby John Joseph Briggs. Esq., deserves a friendly recognition. As the\r\njournal of a naturalist, an angler, and a lover of nature, it is so\r\nsweetly written as to place its author, as a worthy associate, side by\r\nside with dear “Old Izaak” or “White of Selborne.”\r\n\r\n[38] The old palace is now the stables; its roof of arches, supported\r\nby corbels, is intact, and singularly beautiful. Immediately underneath\r\none of the windows is a stone with the inscription, “The last charger\r\nof Arthur, Duke of Wellington (descended from his Waterloo charger,\r\nCopenhagen), was presented by the second duke to Mary, Marchioness of\r\nSalisbury, June 18, 1852, and was buried near this spot Feb. 24, 1861.”\r\n\r\n[39] Some highly interesting information upon this subject will be\r\nfound in Mr. Jewitt’s “Chatsworth.”\r\n\r\n[40] For the loan of the engravings of the Church, the Children’s\r\nCottage, the Statue of Sir R. Leveson, and the View from Tittensor we\r\nare indebted to Messrs. Albut and Daniel, to whom we desire to express\r\nour best thanks.\r\n\r\n[41] These are the charges which, according to Shakspere, Jack Cade\r\nurged against the Lord Say:—\r\n\r\n“Thou hast most traitorously corrupted the youth of the realm, in\r\nerecting a grammar-school: and whereas, before, our forefathers had no\r\nother books but the score and the tally, thou hast caused printing to\r\nbe used; and, contrary to the king, his crown and dignity, thou hast\r\nbuilt a paper-mill. It will be proved to thy face, that thou hast men\r\nabout thee that usually talk of a noun, and a verb; and such abominable\r\nwords as no Christian ear can endure to hear. Thou hast appointed\r\njustices of peace, to call poor men before them about matters they were\r\nnot able to answer. Moreover, thou hast put them in prison; and because\r\nthey could not read thou hast hanged them; when, indeed, only for that\r\ncause they have been most worthy to live.”\r\n\r\n[42] For an account of this lady and the noble House of Manners see\r\n“Belvoir Castle,” pages 6-14.\r\n\r\n[43] See page 39 for an account of this lady and her family.\r\n\r\n[44] The old castle of Henderskelf, an ancient seat of the Greystocks,\r\nwas built in the reign of Edward III.; it passed into the hands of the\r\nHowards by the marriage of Belted Will with Bessie of the braid apron,\r\n“the word Henderskelf; meaning hundred-hill, or the hill where the\r\nhundreds meet.”\r\n\r\n[45] This bowl and the inscription are still preserved in the Almshouse\r\n\r\n[46] We believe, however, these interesting objects have been removed.\r\n\r\n[47] The prioress was, in right of her title, a baroness of England. It\r\nwas of the Benedictine order.\r\n\r\n[48] A _catalogue raisonné_ of the marbles is printed in the “Salisbury\r\nVolume” of the Archæological Institute (1849), by Charles F. Newton,\r\nEsq., M.A., of the British Museum.\r\n\r\n[49] The following is this curious report:—\r\n\r\nJOHN ROBINSON, ESQ., SECRETARY-GENERAL OF WOODS.\r\n\r\n_Report of Acorns planted in and about Windsor Great Park, &c._\r\n\r\n Year when                              Computed number\r\n  planted.                              of Acorns planted.\r\n\r\n  1788 }\r\n  1789 }                                    4,220,000\r\n  1790 }\r\n\r\n  1791                                      1,098,000\r\n\r\n  1792                                      1,530,000\r\n\r\n  1793                                        680,000\r\n\r\n  1794                                        260,000\r\n\r\n  1795                                        136,000\r\n\r\n  1796                                      1,160,000\r\n\r\n  1797                                        280,000\r\n\r\n  1798                                        720,000\r\n\r\n  1799                                        420,000\r\n\r\n  1800                                        441,000\r\n\r\n  1801                                        280,000\r\n\r\n                                           ——————————\r\n\r\n  Total                                    11,225,000\r\n\r\n\r\n[50] We cordially recommend readers, for a description, with\r\nengravings, of many of the principal inscribed stones in this\r\ncollection, to consult our friend Dr. Bruce’s superb work, the\r\n“Lapidarium Septentrionale,” in which many of them are figured; to this\r\nwe are indebted for the accompanying beautiful engravings, which have\r\nbeen placed at our disposal by Dr. Bruce.\r\n\r\n[51] The dimensions of some of these trees are as follows:—The Douglas\r\nFir (_Abies Douglasii_), 75 ft. in height, 6½ ft. circumference a\r\nyard from the ground, and 49 ft. across from point to point of the\r\nbranches; _Abies Menziesii_, height 65 ft., girth 6 ft. at a yard\r\nfrom the ground; _Picea Cephalonica_, 50 ft. high, girth 4 ft. at a\r\nyard from the base; _Abies Canadensis_, 42 ft. in height, girth 3\r\nft.; _Picea pinsapo_, 40 ft. high; and the “Adam and Eve” ash-trees,\r\none of which measures 21 ft. in girth at 5 ft. from the ground. For\r\nthese dimensions we are indebted to that admirable publication, the\r\n_Gardener’s Chronicle_, in which an excellent account of the grounds of\r\nLowther appeared. To that publication we have to express our obligation\r\nfor the woodcut of the north front of the castle. “A.D. MDXCVIII ex\r\ngravi peste, quæ regionibus hisce incubuit, obierunt apud Penrith 2260,\r\nKendal 2500, Richmond 2200, Carlisle 1196. Posteri, Avertite vos et\r\nvivite.”\r\n\r\n[52] We need only to name one or two of Jacob Thompson’s pictures—the\r\n“Harvest Home in the time of Queen Elizabeth,” the “Highland Ferry\r\nBoat,” “The Proposal,” “Ulleswater from Sharrow Bay,” the “Highland\r\nBride’s Separation,” “Going to Church,” the “Mountain Ramblers,”\r\n“Proserpine,” “Sunny Hours of Childhood,” the “Pet Lamb,” “The Signal,”\r\n“Rush-bearing,” “The Vintage,” and “Homeward Bound”—to direct attention\r\nto the marvels of high Art which issue from his pencil.\r\n\r\n[53] “Transactions of the Architectural Society of the Diocese of\r\nLincoln, 1860.”\r\n\r\n[54] Those who desire to know more of the neighbourhood cannot do\r\nbetter than consult Mr. White’s “Worksop, the Dukery, and Sherwood\r\nForest:” it is an interesting, valuable, and useful book. To it we are\r\nindebted for the engraving of the Greendale Oak on page 354.\r\n\r\n[55] “Le Methode nouvelle & Invention extraordinaire de dresser les\r\nChevaux, les travailler selon la nature et parfaire la nature par la\r\nsubtilité de l’art; la quelle n’a jamais été treuvée que.
