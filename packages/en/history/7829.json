There is little\r\nthat is original in the compilation. The reader will find that extensive\r\nuse has been made of such narratives as that Captain Dring has left us.\r\nThe accounts could have been given in the compiler’s own words, but they\r\nwould only, thereby, have lost in strength. The original narratives are\r\nall out of print, very scarce and hard to obtain, and the writer feels\r\njustified in reprinting them in this collection, for the sake of the\r\ngeneral reader interested in the subject, and not able to search for\r\nhimself through the mass of original material, some of which she has\r\nonly discovered after months of research. Her work has mainly consisted\r\nin abridging these records, collected from so many different sources.\r\n\r\nThe writer desires to express her thanks to the courteous librarians\r\nof the Library of Congress and of the War and Navy Departments; to Dr.\r\nLangworthy for permission to publish his able and interesting paper\r\non the subject of the prisons in New York, and to many others who have\r\nhelped her in her task.\r\n\r\nDANSKE DANDRIDGE.\r\n\r\n_December 6th, 1910._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER\r\n\r\n         PREFACE\r\n\r\n      I.

BIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is with no desire to excite animosity against a people whose blood\r\nis in our veins that we publish this volume of facts about some of the\r\nAmericans, seamen and soldiers, who were so unfortunate as to fall into\r\nthe hands of the enemy during the period of the Revolution. We have\r\nconcealed nothing of the truth, but we have set nothing down in malice,\r\nor with undue recrimination.\r\n\r\nIt is for the sake of the martyrs of the prisons themselves that this\r\nwork has been executed. It is because we, as a people, ought to know\r\nwhat was endured; what wretchedness, what relentless torture, even unto\r\ndeath, was nobly borne by the men who perished by thousands in British\r\nprisons and prison ships of the Revolution; it is because we are in\r\ndanger of forgetting the sacrifice they made of their fresh young\r\nlives in the service of their country; because the story has never been\r\nadequately told, that we, however unfit we may feel ourselves for the\r\ntask, have made an effort to give the people of America some account of\r\nthe manner in which these young heroes, the flower of the land, in the\r\nprime of their vigorous manhood, met their terrible fate.\r\n\r\nToo long have they lain in the ditches where they were thrown, a\r\ncart-full at a time, like dead dogs, by their heartless murderers,\r\nunknown, unwept, unhonored, and unremembered. Who can tell us their\r\nnames? What monument has been raised to their memories?\r\n\r\nIt is true that a beautiful shaft has lately been erected to the martyrs\r\nof the Jersey prison ship, about whom we will have very much to say.\r\nBut it is improbable that even the place of interment of the hundreds of\r\nprisoners who perished in the churches, sugar houses, and other places\r\nused as prisons in New York in the early years of the Revolution, can\r\nnow be discovered. We know that they were, for the most part, dumped\r\ninto ditches dug on the outskirts of the little city, the New York\r\nof 1776. These ditches were dug by American soldiers, as part of the\r\nentrenchments, during Washington’s occupation of Manhattan in the spring\r\nof 1776. Little did these young men think that they were, in some cases,\r\nliterally digging a grave for themselves.\r\n\r\nMore than a hundred and thirty years have passed since the victims of\r\nCunningham’s cruelty and rapacity were starved to death in churches\r\nconsecrated to the praise and worship of a God of love. It is a tardy\r\nrecognition that we are giving them, and one that is most imperfect, yet\r\nit is all that we can now do. The ditches where they were interred have\r\nlong ago been filled up, built over, and intersected by streets. Who of\r\nthe multitude that daily pass to and fro over the ground that should be\r\nsacred ever give a thought to the remains of the brave men beneath their\r\nfeet, who perished that they might enjoy the blessings of liberty?\r\n\r\nRepublics are ungrateful; they have short memories; but it is due to the\r\nmartyrs of the Revolution that some attempt should be made to tell to\r\nthe generations that succeed them who they were, what they did, and why\r\nthey suffered so terribly and died so grimly, without weakening, and\r\nwithout betraying the cause of that country which was dearer to them\r\nthan their lives.\r\n\r\nWe have, for the most part, limited ourselves to the prisons and prison\r\nships in the city and on the waters of New York. This is because such\r\ninformation as we have been able to obtain concerning the treatment\r\nof American prisoners by the British relates, almost entirely, to that\r\nlocality.\r\n\r\nIt is a terrible story that we are about to narrate, and we warn the\r\nlover of pleasant books to lay down our volume at the first page.\r\nWe shall see Cunningham, that burly, red-faced ruffian, the Provost\r\nMarshal, wreaking his vengeance upon the defenceless prisoners in his\r\nkeeping, for the assault made upon him at the outbreak of the war, when\r\nhe and a companion who had made themselves obnoxious to the republicans\r\nwere mobbed and beaten in the streets of New York. He was rescued by\r\nsome friends of law and order, and locked up in one of the jails\r\nwhich was soon to be the theatre of his revenge. We shall narrate the\r\nsufferings of the American prisoners taken at the time of the battle of\r\nLong Island, and after the surrender of Fort Washington, which events\r\noccurred, the first in August, the second in November of the year 1776.\r\n\r\nWhat we have been able to glean from many sources, none of which\r\ncontradict each other in any important point, about the prisons and\r\nprison ships in New York, with a few narratives written by those who\r\nwere imprisoned in other places, shall fill this volume. Perhaps others,\r\nfar better fitted for the task, will make the necessary researches, in\r\norder to lay before the American people a statement of what took place\r\nin the British prisons at Halifax, Charleston, Philadelphia, the waters\r\noff the coast of Florida, and other places, during the eight years of\r\nthe war. It is a solemn and affecting duty that we owe to the dead, and\r\nit is in no light spirit that we, for our part, begin our portion of the\r\ntask.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE RIFLEMEN OF THE REVOLUTION\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will first endeavor to give the reader some idea of the men who were\r\nimprisoned in New York in the fall and winter of 1776, It was in the\r\nsummer of that year that Congress ordered a regiment of riflemen to be\r\nraised in Maryland and Virginia. These, with the so-called “Flying Camp”\r\n of Pennsylvania, made the bulk of the soldiers taken prisoners at Fort\r\nWashington on the fatal 16th of November. Washington had already proved\r\nto his own satisfaction the value of such soldiers; not only by his\r\nexperience with them in the French and Indian wars, but also during the\r\nsiege of Boston in 1775-6.\r\n\r\nThese hardy young riflemen were at first called by the British\r\n“regulars,” “a rabble in calico petticoats,” as a term of contempt.\r\nTheir uniform consisted of tow linen or homespun hunting shirts,\r\nbuckskin breeches, leggings and moccasins. They wore round felt hats,\r\nlooped on one side and ornamented with a buck tail. They carried long\r\nrifles, shot pouches, tomahawks, and scalping knives.\r\n\r\nThey soon proved themselves of great value for their superior\r\nmarksmanship, and the British, who began by scoffing at them, ended by\r\nfearing and hating them as they feared and hated no other troops. The\r\nmany accounts of the skill of these riflemen are interesting, and some\r\nof them shall be given here.\r\n\r\nOne of the first companies that marched to the aid of Washington when he\r\nwas at Cambridge in 1775 was that of Captain Michael Cresap, which was\r\nraised partly in Maryland and partly in the western part of Virginia.\r\nThis gallant young officer died in New York in the fall of 1775, a year\r\nbefore the surrender of Fort Washington, yet his company may be taken as\r\na fair sample of what the riflemen of the frontiers of our country\r\nwere, and of what they could do. We will therefore give the words of\r\nan eyewitness of their performances. This account is taken from the\r\n_Pennsylvania Journal_ of August 23rd, 1775.\r\n\r\n“On Friday evening last arrived at Lancaster, Pa., on their way to the\r\nAmerican camp, Captain Cresap’s Company of Riflemen, consisting of one\r\nhundred and thirty active, brave young fellows, many of whom have been\r\nin the late expedition under Lord Dunmore against the Indians. They\r\nbear in their bodies visible marks of their prowess, and show scars and\r\nwounds which would do honour to Homer’s Iliad. They show you, to use the\r\npoet’s words:\r\n\r\n  “‘Where the gor’d battle bled at ev’ry vein!’\r\n\r\n“One of these warriors in particular shows the cicatrices of four bullet\r\nholes through his body.\r\n\r\n“These men have been bred in the woods to hardships and dangers since\r\ntheir infancy. They appear as if they were entirely unacquainted with,\r\nand had never felt the passion of fear. With their rifles in their\r\nhands, they assume a kind of omnipotence over their enemies. One cannot\r\nmuch wonder at this when we mention a fact which can be fully attested\r\nby several of the reputable persons who were eye-witnesses of it. Two\r\nbrothers in the company took a piece of board five inches broad, and\r\nseven inches long, with a bit of white paper, the size of a dollar,\r\nnailed in the centre, and while one of them supported this board\r\nperpendicularly between his knees, the other at the distance of upwards\r\nof sixty yards, and without any kind of rest, shot eight bullets through\r\nit successively, and spared a brother’s thigh!\r\n\r\n“Another of the company held a barrel stave perpendicularly in his\r\nhands, with one edge close to his side, while one of his comrades, at\r\nthe same distance, and in the manner before mentioned, shot several\r\nbullets through it, without any apprehension of danger on either side.\r\n\r\n“The spectators appearing to be amazed at these feats, were told that\r\nthere were upwards of fifty persons in the same company who could do the\r\nsame thing; that there was not one who could not ‘plug nineteen bullets\r\nout of twenty,’ as they termed it, within an inch of the head of a\r\nten-penny nail.\r\n\r\n“In short, to evince the confidence they possessed in these kind of\r\narms, some of them proposed to stand with apples on their heads, while\r\nothers at the same distance undertook to shoot them off, but the people\r\nwho saw the other experiments declined to be witnesses of this.\r\n\r\n“At night a great fire was kindled around a pole planted in the Court\r\nHouse Square, where the company with the Captain at their head, all\r\nnaked to the waist and painted like savages (except the Captain, who was\r\nin an Indian shirt), indulged a vast concourse of people with a perfect\r\nexhibition of a war-dance and all the manoeuvres of Indians; holding\r\ncouncil, going to war; circumventing their enemies by defiles;\r\nambuscades; attacking; scalping, etc. It is said by those who are judges\r\nthat no representation could possibly come nearer the original. The\r\nCaptain’s expertness and agility, in particular, in these experiments,\r\nastonished every beholder. This morning they will set out on their march\r\nfor Cambridge.”\r\n\r\nFrom the _Virginia Gazette_ of July 22nd, 1775, we make the following\r\nextract: “A correspondent informs us that one of the gentlemen appointed\r\nto command a company of riflemen to be raised in one of the frontier\r\ncounties of Pennsylvania had so many applications from the people in\r\nhis neighborhood, to be enrolled in the service, that a greater number\r\npresented themselves than his instructions permitted him to engage,\r\nand being unwilling to give offence to any he thought of the following\r\nexpedient: He, with a piece of chalk, drew on a board the figure of a\r\nnose of the common size, which he placed at the distance of 150 yards,\r\ndeclaring that those who came nearest the mark should be enlisted. Sixty\r\nodd hit the object.--General Gage, take care of your nose!”\r\n\r\nFrom the _Pennsylvania Journal_, July 25th, 1775: “Captain Dowdle with\r\nhis company of riflemen from Yorktown, Pa., arrived at Cambridge about\r\none o’clock today, and since has made proposals to General Washington to\r\nattack the transport stationed at Charles River. He will engage to take\r\nher with thirty men. The General thinks it best to decline at present,\r\nbut at the same time commends the spirit of Captain Dowdle and his brave\r\nmen, who, though they just came a very long march, offered to execute\r\nthe plan immediately.”\r\n\r\nIn the third volume of American Archives, is an extract from a letter to\r\na gentleman in Philadelphia, dated Frederick Town, Maryland, August\r\n1st, 1775, which speaks of the same company of riflemen whose wonderful\r\nmarksmanship we have already noted. The writer says:\r\n\r\n“Notwithstanding the urgency of my business I have been detained here\r\nthree days by a circumstance truly agreeable. I have had the happiness\r\nof seeing Captain Michael Cresap marching at the head of a formidable\r\ncompany of upwards of one hundred and thirty men from the mountains\r\nand backwoods; painted like Indians; armed with tomahawks and rifles;\r\ndressed in hunting shirts and moccasins; and, tho’ some of them had\r\ntravelled hundreds of miles from the banks of the Ohio, they seemed to\r\nwalk light and easy, and not with less spirit than at the first hour of\r\ntheir march.\r\n\r\n“I was favored by being constantly in Captain Cresap’s company, and\r\nwatched the behavior of his men and the manner in which he treated them,\r\nfor is seems that all who go out to war under him do not only pay the\r\nmost willing obedience to him as their commander, but in every instance\r\nof distress look up to him as their friend and father. A great part of\r\nhis time was spent in listening to and relieving their wants, without\r\nany apparent sense of fatigue and trouble. When complaints were before\r\nhim he determined with kindness and spirit, and on every occasion\r\ncondescended to please without losing dignity.\r\n\r\n“Yesterday, July 31st, the company were supplied with a small quantity\r\nof powder, from the magazine, which wanted airing, and was not in good\r\norder for rifles: in the evening, however, they were drawn out to show\r\nthe gentlemen of the town their dexterity in shooting. A clap board with\r\na mark the size of a dollar was put up; they began to fire offhand, and\r\nthe bystanders were surprised. Few shots were made that were not close\r\nto, or into, the paper. When they had shot some time in this way, some\r\nlay on their backs, some on their breasts or sides, others ran twenty or\r\nthirty steps, and, firing as they ran, appeared to be equally certain\r\nof the mark. With this performance the company were more than satisfied,\r\nwhen a young man took up the board in his hand, and not by the end, but\r\nby the side, and, holding it up, his brother walked to the distance, and\r\ncoolly shot into the white. Laying down his rifle he took the board, and\r\nholding it as it was held before, the second brother shot as the former\r\nhad done.\r\n\r\n“By this exhibition I was more astonished than pleased, but will you\r\nbelieve me when I tell you that one of the men took the board, and\r\nplacing it between his legs, stood with his back to a tree, while\r\nanother drove the centre?\r\n\r\n“What would a regular army of considerable strength in the forests of\r\nAmerica do with one thousand of these men, who want nothing to preserve\r\ntheir health but water from the spring; with a little parched corn (with\r\nwhat they can easily procure by hunting); and who, wrapped in their\r\nblankets in the dead of night, would choose the shade of a tree for\r\ntheir covering, and the earth for their bed?”\r\n\r\nThe descriptions we have quoted apply to the rifle companies of 1775,\r\nbut they are a good general description of the abilities of the riflemen\r\nraised in the succeeding years of the war, many indeed being the same\r\nmen who first volunteered in 1775. In the possession of one of his\r\ndescendants is a letter from one of these men written many years after\r\nthe Revolution to the son of an old comrade in arms, giving an account\r\nof that comrade’s experiences during a part of the war. The letter was\r\nwritten by Major Henry Bedinger of Berkeley County, Virginia, to a son\r\nof General Samuel Finley.\r\n\r\nHenry Bedinger was descended from an old German family. His grandfather\r\nhad emigrated to America from Alsace in 1737 to escape persecution for\r\nhis religious beliefs. The highest rank that Bedinger attained in the\r\nWar of the Revolution was that of captain. He was a Knight of the Order\r\nof the Cincinnati, and he was, after the war, a major of the militia of\r\nBerkeley County. The document in possession of one of his descendants\r\nis undated, and appears to have been a rough copy or draught of the\r\noriginal, which may now be in the keeping of some one of the descendants\r\nof General Finley. We will give it almost entire. Such family letters\r\nare, we need scarcely say, of great value to all who are interested in\r\nhistorical research, supplying, as they do, the necessary details which\r\nfill out and amplify the bare facts of history, giving us a living\r\npicture of the times and events that they describe.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART OF A LETTER FROM MAJOR HENRY BEDINGER TO A SON OF GENERAL SAMUEL\r\nFINLEY\r\n\r\n“Some time in 1774 the late Gen’l Sam’l Finley Came to Martinsburg,\r\nBerkeley County, Virginia, and engaged with the late Col’o John Morrow\r\nto assist his brother, Charles Morrow, in the business of a retail\r\nstore.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Finley continued in that employment until the spring of 1775, when\r\nCongress called on the State of Virginia for two Complete Independent\r\nVolunteer Companies of Riflemen of l00 Men each, to assist Gen’l\r\nWashington in the Siege of Boston & to serve one year. Captains Hugh\r\nStephenson of Berkeley, & Daniel Morgan of Frederick were selected to\r\nraise and command those companies, they being the first Regular troops\r\nrequired to be raised in the State of Virginia for Continental service.\r\n\r\n“Captain Hugh Stephenson’s rendezvous was Shepherd’s Town (not\r\nMartinsburg) and Captain Morgan’s was Winchester. Great exertions were\r\nmade by each Captain to complete his company first, that merit might\r\nbe claimed on that account. Volunteers presented themselves in every\r\ndirection in the Vicinity of these Towns, none were received but young\r\nmen of Character, and of sufficient property to Clothe themselves\r\ncompletely, find their own arms, and accoutrements, that is, an approved\r\nRifle, handsome shot pouch, and powder horn, blanket, knapsack, with\r\nsuch decent clothing as should be prescribed, but which was at first\r\nordered to be only a Hunting shirt and pantaloons, fringed on every edge\r\nand in Various ways.\r\n\r\n“Our Company was raised in less than a week. Morgan had equal\r\nsuccess.--It was never decided which Company was first filled--\r\n\r\n“These Companies being thus unexpectedly called for it was a difficult\r\ntask to obtain rifles of the quality required & we were detained at\r\nShepherds Town nearly six weeks before we could obtain such. Your Father\r\nand some of his Bosom Companions were among the first enrolled. My\r\nBrother, G. M. B., and myself, with many of our Companions, soon joined\r\nto the amount of 100--no more could be received. The Committee of Safety\r\nhad appointed Wm Henshaw as 1st Lieut., George Scott 2nd, and Thomas\r\nHite as 3rd Lieut to this Company, this latter however, declined\r\naccepting, and Abraham Shepherd succeeded as 3d Lieut--all the rest\r\nStood on an equal footing as _Volunteers_--We remained at Shepherds\r\nTown untill the 16th July before we could be Completely armed,\r\nnotwithstanding the utmost exertions. In the mean time your Father\r\nobtained from the gunsmith a remarkable neat light rifle, the stock\r\ninlaid and ornamented with silver, which he held, untill Compelled, as\r\nwere all of us--to ground our arms and surrender to the enemy on the\r\nevening of the 16th day of November 1776.\r\n\r\n“In our Company were many young men of Considerable fortune, & who\r\ngenerally entered from patriotic motives ... Our time of service being\r\nabout to expire Captain Hugh Stephenson was commissioned a Colonel;\r\nMoses Rawlings a Lieutenant Colonel, and Otho Williams Major, to raise a\r\nRifle Regiment for three years: four companies to be raised in Virginia\r\nand four in Maryland.\r\n\r\n“Henshaw and Scott chose to return home. Abraham Shepherd was\r\ncommissioned Captain, Sam’l Finley First Lieutenant, William Kelly\r\nSecond Lieutenant, and myself 3rd Lieutenant. The Commissions of the\r\nField Officers were dated the 8th July, 1776, & those of our Company the\r\n9th of the same month. Shepherd, Finley and myself were dispatched to\r\nBerkeley to recruit and refill the old Company, which we performed\r\nin about five weeks. Col’o Stephenson also returned to Virginia to\r\nfacilitate the raising the additional Companies. While actively employed\r\nin August, 1776, he was taken sick, and in four days died. The command\r\nof the Regiment devolved on Lieutenant Colonel Moses Rawlings, a Very\r\nworthy and brave officer.\r\n\r\n“Our Company being filled we Marched early in September to our\r\nRendezvous at Bergen. So soon as the Regiment was formed it was ordered\r\nup the North River to the English Neighborhood, & in a short time\r\nordered to cross the River and assist in the defence of Fort Washington,\r\nwhere were about three thousand men under the command of Col’o Magaw, on\r\nNew York Island. The enemy in the mean time possessed New York, and\r\nhad followed General Washington to the White Plains, from whence, after\r\nseveral partial actions, he returned, and approached us by the way of\r\nKing’s bridge, with a force of from 8 to 12000 Men. Several frigates ran\r\nup the Hudson from New York to cut off our intercourse with Fort Lee, a\r\nfort on the opposite bank of the North River: and by regular approaches\r\ninvested us on all sides.\r\n\r\n“On the 15th November, 1776, the British General Pattison appeared with\r\na flag near our Guards, demanding a surrender of Fort Washington and the\r\nGarrison. Col’o Magaw replied he should defend it to the last extremity.\r\nPattison declared all was ready to storm the lines and fort, we of\r\ncourse prepared for the Pending contest.\r\n\r\n“At break of day the next morning, the enemy commenced a tremendous\r\nCannonade on every side, while their troops advanced. Our Regt. tho\r\nweak, was most advantageously posted by Rawlings and Williams, on a\r\nSmall Ridge, about half a mile above Fort Washington. The Ridge ran from\r\nthe North River, in which lay three frigates, towards the East River. A\r\ndeep Valley divided us from the enemy, their frigates enfiladed, & their\r\nCannon on the heights behind the advancing troops played incessantly on\r\nour party (consisting of Rawling’s Regiment, say 250 men, and one other\r\ncompany from Maryland, and four companies of Pennsylvania Flying Camp,\r\nalso for the present commanded by Rawlings and Williams).\r\n\r\n“The Artillery were endeavoring to clear the hill while their troops\r\ncrossing the Valley were ascending it, but without much effect. A few of\r\nour men were killed with Cannon and Grape Shott. Not a Shott was fired\r\non our side untill the Enemy had nearly gained the Sumit. Though at\r\nleast five times our numbers our rifles brought down so many that they\r\ngave way several times, but by their overwhelming numbers they at last\r\nsucceeded in possessing the summit. Here, however, was great carnage,\r\neach making every effort to possess and hold so advantageous a position.\r\nThis obstinacy continued for more than an hour, when the enemy brought\r\nup some field pieces, as well as reinforcements. Finding all resistance\r\nuseless, our Regiment gradually gave way, tho’ not before Col’o\r\nRawlings, Major Williams, Peter Hanson, Nin Tannehill, and myself\r\nwere wounded. Lt. Harrison [Footnote: Lieutenant Battaille Harrison\r\nof Berkeley County, Va.] was the only officer of our Regiment Killed.\r\nHanson and Tannehill were mortally wounded. The latter died the same\r\nnight in the Fort, & Hanson died in New York a short time after. Capt.\r\nA. Shepherd, Lieut. Daniel Cresap and myself, with fifty men, were\r\ndetailed the day before the action and placed in the van to receive the\r\nenemy as they came up the hill.\r\n\r\n“The Regiment was paraded in line about fifty yards in our rear, ready\r\nto support us. Your Father of course on that day, and in the whole\r\nof the action commanded Shepherd’s Company, which performed its\r\nduty admirably. About two o’clock P. M. the Enemy obtained complete\r\npossession of the hill, and former battle-ground. Our troops retreated\r\ngradually from redoubt to redoubt, contesting every inch of ground,\r\nstill making dreadful Havoc in the ranks of the enemy. We laboured too\r\nunder disadvantages, the wind blew the smoke full in our faces. About\r\ntwo o’clock A. Shepherd, being the senior Captain, took command of the\r\nRegiment, [Footnote: After Rawlings and Williams were disabled.] and by\r\nthe advice of Col’o Rawlings & Major Williams, gradually retreated from\r\nredoubt to redoubt, to & into the fort with the surviving part of the\r\nRegiment. Col’o Rawlings, Major Williams, and Lt Hanson and myself\r\nquitted the field together, and retreated to the fort. I was slightly\r\nwounded, tho my right hand was rendered entirely useless. Your Father\r\ncontinued with the regiment until all had arrived in the fort. It was\r\nadmitted by all the surviving officers that he had conducted himself\r\nwith great gallantry and the utmost propriety.\r\n\r\n“While we were thus engaged the enemy succeeded much better in every\r\nother quarter, & with little comparative loss. All were driven into the\r\nfort and the enemy began by sundown to break ground within 100 yards of\r\nthe fort.\r\n\r\n“Finding our situation desperate Col’o Magaw dispatched a flag to\r\nGen. Howe who Commanded in person, proposing to surrender on certain\r\nconditions, which not being agreed to, other terms were proposed and\r\naccepted. The garrison, consisting of 2673 privates, & 210 officers,\r\nmarched out, grounded arms, and were guarded to the White House that\r\nsame night, but instead of being treated as agreed on, and allowed to\r\nretain baggage, clothes, and Side Arms, every valuable article was torn\r\naway from both officers and soldiers: every sword, pistol, every good\r\nhat was seized, even in presence of Brittish officers, & the prisoners\r\nwere considered and treated as _Rebels_, to the king and country. On\r\nthe third day after our surrender we were guarded to New York, fourteen\r\nmiles from Fort Washington, where in the evening we received some\r\nbarrels of raw pork and musty spoiled biscuit, being the first Morsel of\r\nprovision we had seen for more than three days. The officers were then\r\nseparated from the soldiers, had articles of parole presented to\r\nus which we signed, placed into deserted houses without Clothing,\r\nprovisions, or fire. No officer was permitted to have a servant, but we\r\nacted in rotation, carried our Cole and Provisions about half a mile on\r\nour backs, Cooked as well as we could, and tried to keep from Starving.\r\n\r\n“Our poor Soldiers fared most wretchedly different. They were crowded\r\ninto sugar houses and Jails without blankets or covering; had Very\r\nlittle given to them to eat, and that little of the Very worst quality.\r\nSo that in two months and four days about 1900 of the Fort Washington\r\ntroops had died. The survivors were sent out and receipted for by\r\nGeneral Washington, and we the officers were sent to Long Island on\r\nparole, and billetted, two in a house, on the families residing in the\r\nlittle townships of Flatbush, New Utrecht, Newlots, and Gravesend, who\r\nwere compelled to board and lodge us at the rate of two dollars per\r\nweek, a small compensation indeed in the exhausted state of that section\r\nof country. The people were kind, being mostly conquered Whigs, but\r\nsometimes hard run to provide sustenance for their own families, with\r\nthe addition, generally, of two men who must have a share of what\r\ncould be obtained. These people could not have furnished us but for the\r\nadvantage of the fisheries, and access at all times to the water. Fish,\r\noysters, clams, Eels, and wild fowl could always be obtained in their\r\nseason.\r\n\r\n“We were thus fixed on the inhabitants, but without money, or clothing.\r\nSometimes a companion would receive a few hard dollars from a friend\r\nthrough a flag of truce, which was often shared by others to purchase a\r\npair of shoes or a shirt.\r\n\r\n“While in New York Major Williams received from a friend about forty\r\nsilver dollars. He was still down with his wound, but requested Captain\r\nShepherd, your Father and myself to come to his room, and there lent\r\neach of us ten Dollars, which enabled each of us to purchase a pair\r\nshoes, a shirt, and some other small matters: this liberality however,\r\ngave some offence. Major Williams was a Marylander, and to assist\r\na Virginian, in preference to a Marylander, was a Crime almost\r\nunpardonable. It however passed off, as it so happened there were some\r\nrefugees in New York from Maryland who had generosity enough to relieve\r\nthe pressing wants of a few of their former acquaintances.\r\n\r\n“We thus lived in want and perfect idleness for years: tho sometimes\r\nif Books could be obtained we made out to read: if paper, pen, and ink\r\ncould be had we wrote. Also to prevent becoming too feeble we exercised\r\nour bodies by playing fives, throwing long bullets, wrestling, running,\r\njumping, and other athletick exercises, in all of which your Father\r\nfully participated. Being all nearly on the same footing as to Clothing\r\nand pocket money (that is we seldom had any of the latter) we lived on\r\nan equality.\r\n\r\n“In the fall of 1777 the Brittish Commander was informed a plan was\r\nforming by a party of Americans to pass over to Long Island and sweep\r\nus off, release us from captivity. There were then on the Island about\r\nthree hundred American officers prisoners. We were of course ordered off\r\nimmediately, and placed on board of two large transports in the North\r\nRiver, as prison ships, where we remained but about 18 days, but it\r\nbeing Very Cold, and we Confined between decks, the Steam and breath of\r\n150 men soon gave us Coughs, then fevers, and had we not been removed\r\nback to our billets I believe One half would have died in six weeks.\r\nThis is all the imprisonment your----”\r\n\r\nThe rest of this valuable letter has been, most unfortunately lost, or\r\npossibly it was never completed.\r\n\r\nWe have given a great deal of it because of its graphic description of\r\nthe men who were captured at Fort Washington, and of the battle itself.\r\nMajor Bedinger was a dignified, well-to-do, country gentleman; honored\r\nand respected by all who knew him, and of unimpeachable veracity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nNAMES OF SOME OF THE PRISONERS OF 1776\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, the officers fared well in comparison with the wretched\r\nprivates. Paroled and allowed the freedom of the city, they had far\r\nbetter opportunities to obtain the necessities of life. “Our poor\r\nsoldiers fared most wretchedly different,” says Major Bedinger.\r\n\r\nBefore we begin, however, to speak of the treatment they received, we\r\nmust make some attempt to tell the reader who they were. We wish it were\r\npossible to give the name of every private who died, or rather who was\r\nmurdered, in the prisons of New York at this time. But that, we fear, is\r\nnow an impossibility. As this account is designed as a memorial to those\r\nmartyred privates, we have made many efforts to obtain their names.\r\nBut if the muster rolls of the different companies who formed the Rifle\r\nRegiment, the Pennsylvania Flying Camp, and the other troops captured by\r\nthe British in the summer and fall of 1776 are in existence, we have not\r\nbeen able to find them.\r\n\r\nThe records of the Revolution kept in the War Department in England\r\nhave been searched in vain by American historians. It is said that the\r\nProvost Marshal, William Cunningham, destroyed his books, in order to\r\nleave no written record of his crimes. The names of 8,000 prisoners,\r\nmostly seamen, who were confined on the prison ship Jersey, alone,\r\nhave been obtained by the Society of Old Brooklynites, from the British\r\nArchives, and, by the kind permission of this Society, we re-publish\r\nthem in the Appendix to this volume.\r\n\r\nHere and there, also, we have obtained a name of one of the brave young\r\nriflemen who died in torment a hundred times worse, because so much less\r\nswift, than that endured on a memorable occasion in India, when British\r\nsoldiers were placed, during a single night, into one of their own\r\n“Black Holes.” But the names of almost all of these our tortured\r\ncountrymen are forgotten as completely as their places of interment are\r\nneglected.\r\n\r\nIn the hands of the writer, however, at this time [Footnote: This\r\nmuster roll was lent to the writer by Henry Bedinger Davenport, Esq, a\r\ndescendant of Major Bedinger] is the pay-roll of one of these companies\r\nof riflemen,--that of Captain Abraham Shepherd of Shepherdstown,\r\nVirginia. It is in the handwriting of Henry Bedinger, one of the\r\nlieutenants of the company.\r\n\r\nWe propose to take this list, or pay roll, as a sample, and to follow,\r\nas well as we can, at this late day, the misfortunes of the men named\r\ntherein. For this purpose we will first give the list of names, and\r\nafterwards attempt to indicate how many of the men died in confinement,\r\nand how many lived to be exchanged.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSTER ROLL\r\n\r\nThe paper in question, falling to pieces with age, and almost illegible\r\nin places, is headed, “An ABSTRACT of the Pay due the Officers and\r\nPrivates of the Company of Riflemen belonging to Captain Abraham\r\nShepherd, being part of a Battalion raised by Colonel Hugh Stevenson,\r\ndeceased, and afterwards commanded by Lieut Colonel Moses Rawlings, in\r\nthe Continental Service from July 1st, 1776, to October 1st, 1778.” The\r\npaper gives the dates of enlistment; those who were killed; those who\r\ndied; those who deserted; those who were discharged; drafted; made\r\nprisoners; “dates until when pay is charged;” “pay per month;” “amount\r\nin Dollars,” and “amount in lawful Money, Pounds, Shillings and pence.”\r\n From this account much information can be gleaned concerning the members\r\nof the company, but we will, for the present, content ourselves with\r\ngiving the muster roll of the company.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSTER ROLL OF CAPTAIN ABRAHAM SHEPHERD’S COMPANY OF RIFLEMEN RAISED IN\r\nJULY, 1776\r\n\r\nCaptain Abraham Shepherd.

He adds that, as\r\nfar as is known, all of these perished in prison, after inscribing their\r\nnames high up upon the walls.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME PRIVATES OF THE PENNSYLVANIA FLYING CAMP WHO PERISHED IN PRISON IN\r\n1776-7\r\n\r\n“Charles Fleming, John Wright, James McKinney, Ebenezer Stille, Jacob\r\nLeinhart, Abraham Van Gordon, Peter D’Aubert, William Carbury, John\r\nMcDowell, Wm.

Scoonover, James Rosencrants.”\r\n\r\nThe names of the officers who were prisoners in New York after the\r\nbattle of Long Island and the surrender of Fort Washington, can easily\r\nbe obtained. But it is not with these, at present, that we have to\r\ndo. We have already seen how much better was their treatment than that\r\naccorded to the hapless privates. It is chiefly to commemmorate the\r\nsufferings of the private soldier and seaman in the British prisons that\r\nthis account has been written.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE PRISONS OF NEW YORK--JONATHAN GILLETT\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will now endeavor to describe the principal places of confinement\r\nused by the British in New York during the early years of the war.\r\nLossing, in his Field Book of the Revolution, thus speaks of these dens\r\nof misery: “At the fight around Fort Washington,” he says, “only one\r\nhundred Americans were killed, while the British loss was one thousand,\r\nchiefly Hessians, But the British took a most cruel revenge. Out of over\r\n2600 prisoners taken on that day, in two months & four days 1900 were\r\nkilled in the infamous sugar houses and other prisons in the city.\r\n\r\n“Association of intense horror are linked with the records of the\r\nprisons and prison ships of New York. Thousands of captives perished\r\nmiserably of hunger, cold, infection, and in some cases, actual poison.\r\n\r\n“All the prisoners taken in the battle near Brooklyn in August, 1776 and\r\nat Fort Washington in November of the same year, were confined in New\r\nYork, nearly 4000 in all. The New Jail and the New Bridewell were the\r\nonly prisons. The former is the present Hall of Records. Three sugar\r\nhouses, some dissenting churches, Columbia College, and the Hospital\r\nwere all used as prisons. The great fire in September; the scarcity of\r\nprovisions; and the cruel conduct of the Provost Marshal all combined\r\nto produce intense sufferings among the men, most of whom entered\r\ninto captivity, strong, healthy, young, able-bodied, the flower of the\r\nAmerican youth of the day.\r\n\r\n“Van Cortlandt’s Sugar House was a famous (or infamous) prison. It stood\r\non the northwest corner of Trinity church-yard.\r\n\r\n“Rhinelander’s Sugar House was on the corner of William and Duane\r\nStreets. Perhaps the worst of all the New York prisons was the third\r\nSugar House, which occupied the space on Liberty Street where two\r\nbuildings, numbers 34 and 36, now stand.\r\n\r\n“The North Dutch Church on William Street contained 800 prisoners, and\r\nthere were perhaps as many in the Middle Dutch Church. The Friends’\r\nMeeting House on Liberty and several other buildings erected for the\r\nworship of a God of love were used as prisons.\r\n\r\n“The New Jail was made a Provost Prison, and here officers and men of\r\nnote were confined. At one time they were so crowded into this building,\r\nthat when they lay down upon the floor to sleep all in the row were\r\nobliged to turn over at the same time at the call, ‘Turn over! Left!\r\nRight!’\r\n\r\n“The sufferings of these brave men were largely due to the criminal\r\nindifference of Loring, Sproat, Lennox, and other Commissaries of the\r\nprisoners.\r\n\r\n“Many of the captives were hanged in the gloom of night without trial\r\nand without a semblance of justice.\r\n\r\n“Liberty Street Sugar House was a tall, narrow building five stories in\r\nheight, and with dismal underground dungeons. In this gloomy abode jail\r\nfever was ever present. In the hot weather of July, 1777, companies of\r\ntwenty at a time would be sent out for half an hour’s outing, in the\r\ncourt yard. Inside groups of six stood for ten minutes at a time at the\r\nwindows for a breath of air.\r\n\r\n“There were no seats; the filthy straw bedding was never changed. Every\r\nday at least a dozen corpses were dragged out and pitched like dead\r\ndogs into the ditches and morasses beyond the city. Escapes, deaths, and\r\nexchange at last thinned the ranks. Hundreds left names and records on\r\nthe walls.”\r\n\r\n“In 1778 the hulks of decaying ships were moored in the Wallabout. These\r\nprison ships were intended for sailors and seaman taken on the ocean,\r\nmostly the crews of privateersmen, but some soldiers were also sent to\r\nlanguish in their holds.\r\n\r\n“The first vessels used were transports in which cattle and other stores\r\nhad been brought over by the British in 1776. These lay in Gravesend Bay\r\nand there many of the prisoners taken in battle near Brooklyn in August,\r\n1776, were confined, until the British took possession of New York, when\r\nthey were moved to that city. In 1778 the hulks of ships were moored in\r\nthe Wallabout, a sheltered bay on the Long Island shore, where the Navy\r\nYard now is.”\r\n\r\nThe sufferings of the prisoners can be better understood by giving\r\nindividual instances, and wherever this is possible it shall be done. We\r\nwill commence by an abstract of\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CASE OF JONATHAN GILLETT OF WEST HARFORD\r\n\r\nThis man with seven others was captured on Long Island on the 27th of\r\nAugust, 1776, before they could take to their boats. He was at first\r\nconfined in a prison ship, but a Masonic brother named John Archer\r\nprocured him the liberty of the city on parole. His rank, we believe,\r\nwas that of a lieutenant. He was a prisoner two years, then was allowed\r\nto go home to die. He exhibited every symptom of poison as well as\r\nstarvation.\r\n\r\nWhen he was dying he said to his son, Jonathan Gillett, Junior, “Should\r\nyou enlist and be taken prisoner as I was, inquire for Mr. John Archer,\r\na man with whom I boarded. He will assist you.”\r\n\r\nIn course of time his son enlisted, was taken prisoner, and confined\r\nin the Old Sugar House on Liberty Street. Here he was nearly starved to\r\ndeath. The prisoners ate mice, rats, and insects. He one day found\r\nin the prison yard the dry parings of a turnip which seemed to him\r\na delicious banquet. It is recorded that Jonathan Gillett, Jr., was\r\nfinally freed from captivity through the efforts of the same gentleman,\r\nMr. John Archer, who had aided his father.\r\n\r\nIn 1852 Jacob Barker offered to present survivors who had been confined\r\nin the Old Sugar House with canes made from the lumber used in its\r\nconstruction. Four of these survivors were found. Their names were\r\nWilliam Clark, Samuel Moulton, Levi Hanford, and Jonathan Gillett, Jr.\r\nThe latter’s father during his confinement wrote a letter to his friends\r\nwhich has been preserved, and is as follows:\r\n\r\nMy Friends,\r\n\r\nNo doubt my misfortunes have reached your ears. Sad as it is, it is\r\ntrue as sad. I was made prisoner the 27th day of August past by a people\r\ncalled heshens, and by a party called Yagers the most Inhuman of all\r\nMortals. I can’t give Room to picture them here but thus much--I at\r\nfirst Resolved not to be taken, but by the Impertunity of the Seven\r\ntaken with me, and being surrounded on all sides I unhapily surendered;\r\nwould to God I never had--then I should never (have) known there\r\nunmerciful cruelties; they first disarmed me, then plundered me of all I\r\nhad, watch, Buckles, money, and sum Clothing, after which they abused\r\nme by bruising my flesh with the butts of there (guns). They knocked me\r\ndown; I got up and they (kept on) beating me almost all the way to\r\nthere (camp) where I got shot of them--the next thing was I was allmost\r\nstarved to death by them. I was keept here 8 days and then sent on board\r\na ship, where I continued 39 days and by (them was treated) much worse\r\nthan when on shore--after I was set on (shore) at New York (I was)\r\nconfined (under) a strong guard till the 20th day of November, after\r\nwhich I have had my liberty to walk part over the City between sun and\r\nsun, notwithstanding there generous allowance of food I must inevitably\r\nhave perished with hunger had not sum friends in this (city) Relieved my\r\nextreme necessity, but I cant expect they can always do it--what I\r\nshall do next I know not, being naked for clothes and void of money, and\r\nwinter present, and provisions very skerce; fresh meat one shilling per\r\npound, Butter three shillings per pound, Cheese two shillings, Turnips\r\nand potatoes at a shilling a half peck, milk 15 Coppers per quart, bread\r\nequally as dear; and the General says he cant find us fuel thro’ the\r\nwinter, tho’ at present we receive sum cole. [Footnote: I have made no\r\nchanges in this letter except to fill up some blanks and to add a few\r\nmarks of punctuation.]\r\n\r\n“I was after put on board siezed violently with the disentarry--it\r\nfollowed me hard upwards of six weeks--after that a slow fever, but now\r\nam vastly better * * * my sincere love to you and my children. May God\r\nkeep and preserve you at all times from sin, sickness, and death * * *\r\nI will Endeavor to faintly lead you into the poor cituation the soldiers\r\nare in, espechally those taken at Long Island where I was; in fact these\r\ncases are deplorable and they are Real objects of pitty--they are still\r\nconfined and in houses where there is no fire--poor mortals, with little\r\nor no clothes--perishing with hunger, offering eight dollars in paper\r\nfor one in silver to Relieve there distressing hunger; occasioned for\r\nwant of food--there natures are broke and gone, some almost loose there\r\nvoices and some there hearing--they are crouded into churches & there\r\nguarded night and day. I cant paint the horable appearance they make--it\r\nis shocking to human nature to behold them. Could I draw the curtain\r\nfrom before you; there expose to your view a lean Jawd mortal, hunger\r\nlaid his skinny hand (upon him) and whet to keenest Edge his stomach\r\ncravings, sorounded with tattred garments, Rotten Rags, close beset\r\nwith unwelcome vermin. Could I do this, I say, possable I might in some\r\n(small) manner fix your idea with what appearance sum hundreds of these\r\npoor creatures make in houses where once people attempted to Implore\r\nGod’s Blessings, &c, but I must say no more of there calamities. God be\r\nmerciful to them--I cant afford them no Relief. If I had money I soon\r\nwould do it, but I have none for myself.--I wrote to you by Mr. Wells to\r\nsee if some one would help me to hard money under my present necessity\r\nI write no more, if I had the General would not allow it to go out, & if\r\never you write to me write very short or else I will never see it--what\r\nthe heshens robbed me of that day amounted to the value of seventy two\r\ndollars at least. * * * I will give you as near an exact account of how\r\nmany prisoners the enemy have taken as I can. They took on Long Island\r\nof the Huntingon Regiment 64, and of officers 40, of other Regiments\r\nabout 60. On Moulogin Island 14, Stratton Island (Staten) 7, at Fort\r\nWashington 2200 officers and men. On the Jersey side about 28 officers\r\nand men. In all 3135 and how many killed I do not know. Many died of\r\nthere wounds. Of those that went out with me of sickness occasioned by\r\nhunger eight and more lie at the point of death.\r\n\r\n“Roger Filer hath lost one of his legs and part of a Thigh, it was his\r\nleft. John Moody died here a prisoner.\r\n\r\n“So now to conclude my little Ragged History * * * I as you know did\r\never impress on your mind to look to God, for so still I continue to do\r\nthe same--think less of me but more of your Creator, * * * So in this\r\nI wish you well and bid you farewell and subscribe myself your nearest\r\nfriend and well wisher for Ever\r\n\r\nJohn’a Gillett\r\n\r\nNew York, Dec. 2nd, 1776. To Eliza Gillett at West Harford\r\n\r\nThe figures given in this pathetic letter may be inaccurate, but the\r\ndescription of the sufferings of the prisoners is unexaggerated. Of all\r\nthe places of torment provided for these poor men the churches seem\r\nto have been the worst, and they were probably the scenes of the most\r\nbrutal cruelty that was inflicted upon these unfortunate beings by the\r\nwicked and heartless men, in whose power they found themselves. Whether\r\nit was because the knowledge that they were thus desecrating buildings\r\ndedicated to the worship of God and instruction in the Christian duties\r\nof mercy and charity, had a peculiarly hardening effect upon the jailers\r\nand guards employed by the British, or whether it was merely because\r\nof their unfitness for human habitation, the men confined in these\r\nbuildings perished fast and miserably. We cannot assert that no\r\nprisoners shut up in the churches in New York lived to tell the awful\r\ntale of their sufferings, but we do assert that in all our researches\r\nwe have never yet happened upon any record of a single instance of a\r\nsurvivor living to reach his home. All the information we have gained\r\non this subject we shall lay before the reader, and then he may form his\r\nown opinion of the justice of these remarks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nWILLIAM CUNNINGHAM, THE PROVOST MARSHAL\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will condense all that we have to say of this man, whose cruelty and\r\nwickedness are almost inconceivable, into one chapter, and have done\r\nwith the dreadful subject. As far as we have been able to learn, the\r\nfacts about his life are the following.\r\n\r\nWilliam Cunningham was an Irishman, born in Dublin Barracks in 1738.\r\nHis father was a trumpeter in the Blue Dragoons. When he was sixteen he\r\nbecame an assistant to the riding-master of the troop. In 1761 he\r\nwas made a sergeant of dragoons, but peace having been proclaimed the\r\nfollowing year, the company to which he belonged was disbanded. He\r\nafterwards commenced the business of a scaw-banker, which means that\r\nhe went about the country enticing mechanics and rustics to ship to\r\nAmerica, on promise of having their fortunes made in that country; and\r\nthen by artful practices, produced their indentures as servants, in\r\nconsequence of which on their arrival in America they were sold, or at\r\nleast obliged to serve a term of years to pay for their passage. This\r\nbusiness, no doubt, proved a fit apprenticeship for the career of\r\nvillainy before him.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1774 he appears to have embarked from Newry in the ship\r\nNeedham for New York, with some indentured servants he had kidnapped in\r\nIreland. He is said to have treated these poor creatures so cruelly on\r\nthe passage that they were set free by the authorities in New York upon\r\ntheir arrival.\r\n\r\nWhen Cunningham first appeared in New York he offered himself as a\r\nhorse-breaker, and insinuated himself into the favor of the British\r\nofficers by blatant toryism. He soon became obnoxious to the Whigs of\r\nthat city, was mobbed, and fled to the Asia man-of-war for protection.\r\nFrom thence he went to Boston, where General Gage appointed him Provost\r\nMarshal. When the British took possession of New York he followed them\r\nto that city, burning with desire to be revenged upon the Whigs.\r\n\r\nHe is said to have compassed the death of thousands of prisoners by\r\nselling their provisions, exchanging good for spoiled food, and even by\r\npoisoning them. Many also fell victims to his murderous violence. About\r\ntwo hundred and fifty of these poor creatures were taken out of their\r\nplaces of confinement at midnight and hung, without trial, simply to\r\ngratify his bloodthirsty instincts. Private execution was conducted in\r\nthe following manner. A guard was first dispatched from the Provost,\r\nabout midnight, to the upper barracks, to order the people on the\r\nline of march to shut their window shutters and put out their lights,\r\nforbidding them at the same time to presume to look out of their windows\r\non pain of death. After this the prisoners were gagged, and conducted\r\nto the gallows just behind the upper barracks and hung without ceremony\r\nthere. Afterwards they were buried by his assistant, who was a mulatto.\r\n\r\nThis practice is said to have been stopped by the women along the line\r\nof march from the Provost to the barracks. They appealed to General\r\nHowe to prevent further executions, as the noise made by the sufferers\r\npraying for mercy, and appealing to Heaven for justice was dreadful to\r\ntheir ears.\r\n\r\nIt would seem from this account that, although the wretched men were\r\ngagged as they were conveyed along the streets, their ferocious murderer\r\ncould not deny himself the pleasure of hearing their shrieks of agony at\r\nthe gallows.\r\n\r\nWatson, in his “Annals of New York,” says that Cunningham glutted his\r\nvengence by hanging five or six of his prisoners every night, until the\r\nwomen who lived in the neighborhood petitioned Howe to have the practice\r\ndiscontinued.\r\n\r\nA pamphlet called “The Old Martyrs’ Prison,” says of Cunningham: “His\r\nhatred of the Americans found vent in torture by searing irons and\r\nsecret scourges to those who fell under the ban of his displeasure.\r\nThe prisoners were crowded together so closely that many fell ill from\r\npartial asphyxiation, and starved to death for want of the food which he\r\nsold to enrich himself.”\r\n\r\nThey were given muddy and impure water to drink, and that not in\r\nsufficient quantities to sustain life. Their allowance was, nominally,\r\ntwo pounds of hard tack and two of pork _per week_, and this was often\r\nuncooked, while either the pork, or the biscuit, or both, were usually\r\nspoiled and most unwholesome.\r\n\r\nCunningham’s quarters were in the Provost Prison, and on the right hand\r\nof the main door of entry. On the left of the hall was the guard room.\r\nWithin the first barricade was the apartment of his assistant, Sergeant\r\nO’Keefe. Two sentinels guarded the entrance day and night; two more were\r\nstationed at the first and second barricades, which were grated, barred,\r\nand chained.\r\n\r\n“When a prisoner was led into the hall the whole guard was paraded,\r\nand he was delivered over to Captain Cunningham or his deputy, and\r\nquestioned as to his name, age, size, rank, etc., all of which was\r\nentered in a record book. These records appear to have been discreetly\r\ndestroyed by the British authorities.\r\n\r\n“At the bristling of arms, unbolting of locks and bars, clanking of\r\nenormous iron chains in a vestibule dark as Erebus, the unfortunate\r\ncaptive might well sink under this infernal sight and parade of\r\ntyrannical power, as he crossed the threshold of that door which\r\nprobably closed on him for life.\r\n\r\n“The north east chamber, turning to the left on the second floor, was\r\nappropriated to officers of superior rank, and was called Congress Hall.\r\n* * * In the day time the packs and blankets used by the prisoners to\r\ncover them were suspended around the walls, and every precaution was\r\ntaken to keep the rooms clean and well ventilated.\r\n\r\n“In this gloomy abode were incarcerated at different periods many\r\nAmerican officers and citizens of distinction, awaiting with sickening\r\nhope the protracted period of their liberation. Could these dumb walls\r\nspeak what scenes of anguish might they not disclose!\r\n\r\n“Cunningham and his deputy were enabled to fare sumptuously by dint\r\nof curtailing the prisoners’ rations, selling good for bad provisions,\r\netc., in order to provide for the drunken orgies that usually terminated\r\nhis dinners. Cunningham would order the rebel prisoners to turn out\r\nand parade for the amusement of his guests, pointing them out with such\r\ncharacterizations as ‘This is the d----d rebel, Ethan Allen. This is a\r\nrebel judge, etc.’”\r\n\r\nCunningham destroyed Nathan Hale’s last letters containing messages to\r\nhis loved ones, in order, as he said, that “the rebels should not know\r\nthat they had a man in their army who could die with such firmness.”\r\n\r\nFrom Elias Boudinot’s “Journal of Events” during the Revolution we\r\nextract the following account of his interview with Cunningham in\r\nNew York. “In the spring of 1777 General Washington wrote me a letter\r\nrequesting me to accept of a Commission as Commissary General of\r\nPrisoners in the Army of America. I waited on him and politely declined\r\nthe task, urging the wants of the Prisoners and having nothing to supply\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\nWashington, however, urged him not to refuse, saying that if no one in\r\nwhom he could trust would accept the office, the lot of the prisoners\r\nwould be doubly hard. At last Boudinot consented to fill the position as\r\nbest he could, and Washington declared that he should be supplied with\r\nfunds by the Secret Committee of Congress. “I own,” he says, “that after\r\nI had entered on my department, the applications of the Prisoners were\r\nso numerous, and their distress so urgent, that I exerted every nerve\r\nto obtain supplies, but in vain--Excepting £600 I had received from the\r\nSecret Committee in Bills of exchange, at my first entrance into\r\nthe Office--I could not by any means get a farthing more, except in\r\nContinental Money, which was of no avail in New York. I applied to the\r\nGeneral describing my delicate Situation and the continual application\r\nof the Officers, painting their extreme distress and urging the\r\nassurance they had received that on my appointment I was to be furnished\r\nwith adequate means for their full relief. The General appeared greatly\r\ndistressed and assured me that it was out of his power to afford me any\r\nsupplies. I proposed draining Clothing from the public stores, but to\r\nthis he objected as not having anything like a sufficient supply for the\r\nArmy. He urged my considering and adopting the best means in my power to\r\nsatisfy the necessities of the Prisoners, and he would confirm them. I\r\ntold him I knew of no means in my Power but to take what Monies I had\r\nof my own, and to borrow from my friends in New York, to accomplish the\r\ndesirable purpose. He greatly encouraged me to the attempt, promising me\r\nthat if I finally met with any loss, he would divide it with me. On this\r\nI began to afford them some supplies of Provisions over and above what\r\nthe Enemy afforded them, which was very small and very indifferent.\r\n\r\n“The complaints of the very cruel treatment our Prisoners met with in\r\nthe Enemy’s lines rose to such a Heighth that in the Fall of this\r\nYear, 1777 the General wrote to General Howe or Clinton reciting their\r\ncomplaints and proposing to send an Officer into New York to examine\r\ninto the truth of them. This was agreed to, and a regular pass-port\r\nreturned accordingly. The General ordered me on this service. I\r\naccordingly went over on the 3rd of Feb. 1778, in my own Sloop.”\r\n\r\nThe Commandant at this time was General Robertson, by whom Boudinot was\r\nvery well treated, and allowed, in company with a British officer, to\r\nvisit the prisons. He continues: “Accordingly I went to the Provost\r\nwith the Officer, where we found near thirty Officers from Colonels\r\ndownwards, in close confinement in the Gaol in New York. After some\r\nconversation with the late Ethan Allen, I told him my errand, on which\r\nhe was very free in his abuse of the British. *** We then proceeded\r\nupstairs to the Room of their Confinement. I had the Officers drawn up\r\nin a Ring and informed them of my mission, that I was determined to hear\r\nnothing in secret. That I therefore hoped they would each of them in\r\ntheir turn report to me faithfully and candidly the Treatment they\r\nseverally had received,--that my design was to obtain them the proper\r\nredress, but if they kept back anything from an improper fear of their\r\nkeepers, they would have themselves only to blame for their want of\r\nimmediate redress. That for the purpose of their deliverance the British\r\nofficer attended. That the British General should be also well informed\r\nof the Facts. On this, after some little hesitation from a dread of\r\ntheir keeper, the Provost Martial, one of them began and informed us\r\nthat * * * some had been confined in the Dungeon for a night to await\r\nthe leisure of the General to examine them and forgot for months; for\r\nbeing Committee men, &c, &c. That they had received the most cruel\r\nTreatment from the Provost Martial, being locked up in the Dungeon on\r\nthe most trifling pretences, such as asking for more water to drink on\r\na hot day than usual--for sitting up a little longer in the Evening\r\nthan orders allowed--for writing a letter to the General making their\r\nComplaints of ill-usage and throwing (it) out of the Windows. That some\r\nof them were kept ten, twelve, and fourteen weeks in the Dungeon on\r\nthese trifling Pretenses. A Captain Vandyke had been confined eighteen\r\nmonths for being concerned in setting fire to the City, When, on\r\nmy calling for the Provost Books, it appeared that he had been made\r\nPrisoner and closely confined in the Provost four days before the fire\r\nhappened. A Major Paine had been confined eleven months for killing a\r\nCaptain Campbell in the Engagement when he was taken Prisoner, when on\r\nexamination it appeared that the Captain had been killed in another\r\npart of the Action. The charge was that Major Paine when taken had no\r\ncommission, though acknowledged by us as a Major.\r\n\r\n“Most of the cases examined into turned out wholly false or too trifling\r\nto be regarded. It also appeared by the Declaration of some of the\r\nGentlemen that their water would be sometimes, as the Caprice of the\r\nProvost Martial led him, brought up to them in the tubs they used in\r\ntheir Rooms, and when the weather was so hot that they must drink or\r\nperish. On hearing a number of these instances of Cruelty, I asked who\r\nwas the Author of them--they answered the provost keeper--I desired\r\nthe Officer to call him up that we might have him face to face. He\r\naccordingly came in, and on being informed of what had passed, he was\r\nasked if the complaints were true. He, with great Insolence answered\r\nthat every word was true--on which the British Officer, abusing him very\r\nmuch, asked him how he dared to treat Gentlemen in that cruel Manner.\r\nHe, insolently putting his hands to his side, swore that he was as\r\nabsolute there as General Howe was at the head of his Army. I observed\r\nto the Officer that now there could be no dispute about Facts, as the\r\nfellow had acknowledged every word to be true. I stated all the Facts in\r\nsubstance and waited again on General Robertson, who hoped I was quite\r\nsatisfied with the falsity of the reports I had heard. I then stated to\r\nhim the Facts and assured him that they turned out worse than anything\r\nwe had heard. On his hesitating as to the truth of this assertion--I\r\nobserved to him the propriety of having an Officer with me, to whom\r\nI now appealed for the truth of the Facts. He being present confirmed\r\nthem--on which the General expressed great dissatisfaction, and promised\r\nthat the Author of them should be punished. I insisted that the Officers\r\nshould be discharged from his Power on Parole on Long Island, as other\r\nOfficers were--To this after receiving from me a copy of the Facts I had\r\ntaken down, he assented, & all were discharged except seven, who were\r\ndetained some time before I could obtain their release. I forgot to\r\nmention that one Officer, Lieutenant--was taken Prisoner and brought in\r\nwith a wound through the leg. He was sent to the Provost to be examined,\r\nnext night he was put into the Dungeon and remained there ten weeks,\r\ntotally forgotten by the General, and never had his wound dressed\r\nexcept as he washed it with a little Rum and Water given to him by the\r\nCentinels, through the--hole out of their own rations. Captain--and a\r\nCaptain Chatham were confined with them and their allowance was four\r\npounds hard spoiled Biscuit, and two pounds Pork per week, which they\r\nwere obliged to eat raw. While they were thus confined for the\r\nslightest Complaints, the Provost Martial would come down and beat them\r\nunmercifully with a Rattan, and Knock them down with his fist. After\r\nthis I visited two Hospitals of our Sick Prisoners, and the Sugar\r\nHouse:--in the two first were 211 Prisoners, and in the last about 190.\r\nThey acknowledged that for about two months past they fared pretty well,\r\nbeing allowed two pounds of good Beef and a proportion of flour or Bread\r\nper week, by Mr. Lewis, My Agent, over and above the allowance received\r\nfrom the British, which was professed to be two thirds allowance;\r\nbut before they had suffered much from the small allowance they had\r\nreceived, and and that their Bread was very bad, being mostly biscuit,\r\nbut that the British soldiers made the same complaint as to the bread.\r\nFrom every account I received I found that their treatment had been\r\ngreatly changed for the better within a few months past, except at\r\nthe Provost. They all agreed that previous to the capture of General\r\nBurgoyne, and for some time after, Their treatment had been cruel\r\nbeyond measure. That the Prisoners in the French church, amounting on an\r\naverage to three or four hundred, could not all lay down at once, that\r\nfrom the 15th October to the first January they never received a single\r\nstick of wood, and that for the most part they eat their Pork Raw, when\r\nthe Pews and Door, and Wood on Facings failed them for fuel.\r\n\r\n“But as to my own personal knowledge I found General Robertson very\r\nready to agree to every measure for alleviating the miseries of War and\r\nvery candidly admitted many faults committed by the inferior Officers,\r\nand even the mistakes of the General himself, by hearkening to the\r\nrepresentations of those around him. He showed me a letter from General\r\nHowe who was in Philadelphia, giving orders that we should not be at\r\nliberty to purchase blankets within their lines, and containing a copy\r\nof an order I had issued that they should not purchase provisions within\r\nours, by way of retaliation, but he represented it as if my order was\r\nfirst. I stated the facts to General Robertson, who assured me that\r\nGeneral Howe had been imposed upon, and requested me to state the facts\r\nby way of letter, when he immediately wrote to General Howe, urging the\r\npropriety of reversing his orders, which afterwards he did in a very\r\nhypocritical manner as will appear hereafter.”\r\n\r\nIt does not seem that Cunningham was very seriously punished. It is\r\nprobable that he was sent away from New York to Philadelphia, then in\r\nthe hands of General Howe. Cunningham was Provost Marshal in that city\r\nduring the British occupancy, where his cruelties were, if possible,\r\nmore astrocious than ever before.\r\n\r\nDr. Albigense Waldo was a surgeon in the American army at Valley Forge,\r\nand he declares in his Journal concerning the prisoners in Philadelphia\r\nthat “the British did not knock the prisoners in the head, or burn them\r\nwith torches, or flay them alive, or dismember them as savages do, but\r\nthey starved them slowly in a large and prosperous city. One of these\r\nunhappy men, driven to the last extreme of hunger, is said to have\r\ngnawed his own fingers to the first joint from the hand, before he\r\nexpired. Others ate the mortar and stone which they chipped from the\r\nprison walls, while some were found with bits of wood and clay in\r\ntheir mouths, which in their death agonies they had sucked to find\r\nnourishment.” [Footnote: This account is quoted by Mr. Bolton in a\r\nrecent book called “The Private Soldier under Washington,” a valuable\r\ncontribution to American history.]\r\n\r\nBoudinot has something to say about these wretched sufferers in the\r\nCity of Brotherly Love during the months of January and February, 1778.\r\n“Various Reports having reached us with regard to the Extreme\r\nSufferings of our Prisoners in Philadelphia, I was directed by the\r\nCommander-in-Chief to make particular inquiry into the truth. After some\r\ntime I obtained full Information of their Sufferings. It was proved by\r\nsome Militia of good Character that on being taken they were put under\r\nthe care of the General’s Guard, and kept four or five days without\r\nthe least food. That on the fifth day they were taken into the Provost,\r\nwhere a small quantity of Raw Pork was given to them. One of their\r\nnumber seized and devoured it with so much eagerness that he dropped\r\ndown dead:--that the Provost Martial used to sell their provisions and\r\nleave them to starve, as he did their Allowance of Wood. I received\r\ninformation from a British Officer who confided in my integrity, that he\r\nhappened in the Provost just at the time the Provost Martial was locking\r\nup the Prisoners. He had ordered them from the Yard into the House. Some\r\nof them being ill with the Dysentery could scarcely walk, and for not\r\ncoming faster he would beat them with his Rattan. One being delayed\r\nlonger than the rest. On his coming up Cunningham gave him a blow with\r\none of the large Keys of the Goal which killed him on the Spot. The\r\nOfficer, exceedingly affected with the sight, went next day and lodged\r\na formal Complaint of the Murder with General Howe’s Aid. After waiting\r\nsome days, and not discovering any measures taken for the tryal of\r\nCunningham, he again went to head quarters and requested to see the\r\nGeneral, but was refused. He repeated his Complaint to his Aid, and told\r\nhim if this passed unpunished it would become disreputable to wear a\r\nBritish uniform. No notice being taken the Officer determined to furnish\r\nme privately with the means of proof of the Facts, so that General\r\nWashington might remonstrate to General Howe on the subject:--I reported\r\nthem with the other testimony I had collected to General Washington.\r\nHe accordingly wrote in pretty strong Terms to General Howe and fixed\r\na day, when if he did not receive a satisfactory answer, he would\r\nretaliate on the prisoners in his Custody. On the day he received an\r\nanswer from General Howe, acknowledging that, on Examination he found\r\nthat Cunningham had sold the Prisoners’ rations publicly in the Market.\r\nThat he had therefor removed him from the Charge of the Prisoners\r\nand appointed Mr. Henry H. Ferguson in his place. This gave us great\r\npleasure as we knew Mr. Ferguson to be a Gentleman of Character and\r\ngreat Humanity, and the issue justified our expectations. But to our\r\ngreat surprise Mr. Cunningham was only removed from the Charge of the\r\nPrisons in Philadelphia, and sent to that of New York. Soon after this\r\ngreat complaints being made of our Prisoners being likely to perish for\r\nwant of Cloathing and Blankets, having been mostly stripped and robbed\r\nof their Cloaths when taken, application was made for permission to\r\npurchase (with the provisions which the British wanted,) Blankets\r\nand cloathing, which should be used only by the Prisoners while in\r\nConfinement. This was agreed to, as we were informed by our own Agent\r\nas well as by the British Commissioner. Provisions were accordingly\r\nattempted to be sent in, when General Howe pretending to ignorance in\r\nthe business, forbid the provisions to be admitted, or the Blankets to\r\nbe purchased. On this I gave notice to the British Commissary that after\r\na certain day they must provide food for their prisoners south west of\r\nNew Jersey, and to be sent in from their lines, as they should no longer\r\nbe allowed to purchase provisions with us. The line drawn arose from our\r\nbeing at liberty to purchase in New York. This made a great noise,\r\nwhen General Howe on receiving General Robertson’s letter from New York\r\nbefore mentioned, urging the propriety of the measures, issued an order\r\nthat every Person in Philadelphia, who had a Blanket to sell or to spare\r\nshould bring them into the King’s Stores. When this was done he then\r\ngave my Agent permission to purchase Blankets and Cloathing, in the City\r\nof Philadelphia. On my Agent attempting it he found every Blanket in the\r\nCity purchased by the Agents for the Army, so that not a Blanket could\r\nbe had. My Agent knowing the necessities of our Prisoners, immediately\r\nemployed persons in every part of the city and before General Howe could\r\ndiscover his own omission, purchased up every piece of flannel he could\r\nmeet with, and made it up into a kind of Blanket, which answered our\r\npurpose.”\r\n\r\nWherever General Howe and Cunningham were together, either in New York\r\nor in Philadelphia, the most atrocious cruelties were inflicted upon\r\nthe American prisoners in their power, and yet some have endeavoured to\r\nexcuse General Howe, on what grounds it is difficult to determine. It\r\nhas been said that Cunningham _acted on higher authority than any in\r\nAmerica_, and that Howe in vain endeavored to mitigate the sufferings of\r\nthe prisoners. This, however, is not easy of belief. Howe must at least\r\nhave wilfully blinded himself to the wicked and murderous violence of\r\nhis subordinate. It was his duty to know how the prisoners at his mercy\r\nfared, and not to employ murderers to destroy them by the thousands as\r\nthey were destroyed in the prisons of New York and Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nOliver Bunce, in His “Romance of the Revolution,” thus speaks of the\r\ninhumanity of Cunningham.\r\n\r\n“But of all atrocities those committed in the prisons and prison ships\r\nof New York are the most execrable, and indeed there is nothing in\r\nhistory to excel the barbarities there inflicted. Twelve thousand\r\nsuffered death by their inhuman, cruel, savage, and barbarous usage on\r\nboard the filthy and malignant prison ships--adding those who died and\r\nwere poisoned in the infected prisons in the city a much larger number\r\nwould be necessary to include all those who suffered by command of\r\nBritish Generals in New York. The scenes enacted in these prisons\r\nalmost exceed belief. * * * Cunningham, the like of whom, for unpitying,\r\nrelentless cruelty, the world has not produced, * * * thirsted for\r\nblood, and took an eager delight in murder.”\r\n\r\nHe remained in New York until November, 1783, when he embarked on board\r\na British man-of-war and America was no longer cursed with his presence.\r\nHe is said to have been hung for the crime of forgery on the tenth of\r\nAugust, 1791. The newspapers of the day contained the accounts of his\r\ndeath, and his dying confession. These accounts have, however, been\r\ndiscredited by historians who have in vain sought the English records\r\nfor the date of his death. It is said that no man of the name of\r\nCunningham was hung in England in the year 1791. It is not possible\r\nto find any official British record of his transactions while Provost\r\nMarshal, and there seems a mystery about the disappearance of his books\r\nkept while in charge of the Provost, quite as great as the mystery which\r\nenvelopes his death. But whether or no he confessed his many crimes;\r\nwhether or no he received in this world a portion of the punishment\r\nhe deserved, it is certain that the crimes were committed, and duly\r\nrecorded in the judgment book of God, before whose awful bar he has been\r\ncalled to account for every one of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE CASE OF JABEZ FITCH\r\n\r\n\r\nIn presenting our gleanings from the books, papers, letters, pamphlets,\r\nand other documents that have been written on the subject of our\r\nprisoners during the Revolution, we will endeavor to follow some\r\nchronological order, so that we may carry the story on month by month\r\nand year by year until that last day of the British possession of New\r\nYork when Sergeant O’Keefe threw down upon the pavement of the Provost\r\nthe keys of that prison, and made his escape on board a British\r\nman-of-war.\r\n\r\nOne of the prisoners taken on Long Island in the summer of 1776 was\r\nCaptain Jabez Fitch, who was captured on the 27th of August, of that\r\nyear. While a prisoner he contracted a scorbutic affection which\r\nrendered miserable thirty years of his life.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of August he was taken to the transport Pacific. It was a\r\nvery rainy day. The officers, of whom there were about twenty-five,\r\nwere in one boat, and the men “being between three and four hundred\r\nin several other Boats, and had their hands tied behind them. In this\r\nSituation we were carried by several Ships, where there appeared great\r\nnumbers of Women on Deck, who were very liberal of their Curses and\r\nExecrations: they were also not a little Noisy in their Insults, but\r\nclap’d their hands and used other peculiar gestures in so Extraordinary\r\na Manner yet they were in some Danger of leaping overboard in this\r\nsurprising Extacy.” On arriving at the Pacific, a very large transport\r\nship, they were told that all officers and men together were to be\r\nshut down below deck. The master of the ship was a brute named Dunn. At\r\nsundown all were driven down the hatches, with curses and execrations.\r\n“Both ye lower Decks were very full of Durt,” and the rains had leaked\r\nin and made a dreadful sloppy mess of the floor, so that the mud was\r\nhalf over their shoes. At the same time they were so crowded that only\r\nhalf their number could lie down at a time.\r\n\r\n“Some time in the Evening a number of the Infernal Savages came down\r\nwith a lanthorn and loaded two small pieces or Cannon with Grape shot,\r\nwhich were pointed through two Ports in such a manner as to Rake ye deck\r\nwhere our people lay, telling us at ye same time with many Curses yt in\r\nCase of any Disturbance or the least noise in ye Night, they were to be\r\nImediately fired on ye Damned Rebels.” When allowed to come on deck\r\n“we were insulted by those Blackguard Villians in the most vulgar\r\nmanner....We were allowed no water that was fit for a Beast to Drink,\r\nalthough they had plenty of good Water on board, which was used\r\nplentifully by the Seamen, etc.\r\n\r\n“Lieutenant Dowdswell, with a party of Marines sent on board for our\r\nGuard; this Mr. Dowdswell treated us with considerable humanity, and\r\nappeared to be a Gentleman, nor were the Marines in General so Insolent\r\nas the Ships Crew....On the 31st the Commissary of Prisoners came on\r\nBoard and took down the names, etc, of the prisoners....he told us\r\nColonel Clark and many other Officers were confined at Flatbush. On\r\nSunday, September 1st, we were removed to the ship Lord Rochford,\r\ncommanded by one Lambert. This ship was much crowded. Most of\r\nthe Officers were lodged on the quarter deck. Some nights we were\r\nconsiderably wet with rain.”\r\n\r\nThe Lord Rochford lay off New Utrecht. On the third of September the\r\nofficers that had been confined at Flatbush were brought on board the\r\nsnow called the Mentor. “On the fifth,” says Fitch, in his written\r\naccount, of which this is an abstract, “we were removed on board this\r\nSnow, which was our prison for a long time. * * * We were about 90 in\r\nnumber, and ye Field Officers had Liberty of ye Cabbin, etc. * * * This\r\nSnow was commanded by one Davis, a very worthless, low-lived fellow. * *\r\n* When we first met on board the Mentor we spent a considerable time in\r\nRelating to each other ye particular Circumstances of our first being\r\nTaken, and also ye various Treatment with which we met on yt occasion,\r\nnor was this a disagreeable Entertainment in our Melancholy Situation.\r\n* * * Many of the officers and men were almost Destitute of Clothes,\r\nseveral having neither Britches, Stockings or Shoes, many of them when\r\nfirst taken were stripped entirely naked. Corporal Raymond of the 17th\r\nRegiment after being taken and Stripped was shamefully insulted and\r\nAbused by Gen’l Dehightler, seized by ye Hair of his head, thrown on\r\nthe ground, etc. Some present, who had some small degree of humanity in\r\ntheir Composition, were so good as to favor them (the prisoners) with\r\nsome old durty worn Garments, just sufficient to cover their nakedness,\r\nand in this Situation (they) were made Objects of Ridicule for ye\r\nDiversion of those Foreign Butchers.\r\n\r\n“One Sam Talman (an Indian fellow belonging to the 17th Regiment) was\r\nStripped and set up as a mark for them to Shoot at for Diversion or\r\nPractice, by which he Received two severe wounds, in the neck and arm\r\n* * * afterwards they destroyed him with many hundreds others by\r\nstarvation in the prisons of New York.\r\n\r\n“On October first orders came to land the prisoners in New York. This\r\nwas not done until the seventh. On Monday about four o’clock Mr. Loring\r\nconducted us to a very large house on the West side of Broadway in the\r\ncorner south of Warren Street near Bridewell, where we were assigned a\r\nsmall yard back of the house, and a Stoop in ye Front for our Walk. We\r\nwere also Indulged with Liberty to pass and Repass to an adjacent pump\r\nin Ye Street.”\r\n\r\nAlthough paroled the officers were closely confined in this place for\r\nsix weeks. Their provisions, he says: “were insufficient to preserve ye\r\nConnection between Soul and Body, yet ye Charitable People of this City\r\nwere so good as to afford us very considerable Relief on this account,\r\nbut it was ye poor and those who were in low circumstances only who were\r\nthoughtful of our Necessities, and provisions were now grown scarce and\r\nExcessive dear. * * * Their unparalleled generosity was undoubtedly ye\r\nhappy means of saving many Lives, notwithstanding such great numbers\r\nperished with hunger.\r\n\r\n“Here we found a number of Officers made prisoners since we were,\r\nColonel Selden, Colonel Moulton, etc. They were first confined in Ye\r\nCity Hall. Colonel Selden died the Fryday after we arrived. He was\r\nBuried in the New Brick Churchyard, and most of the Officers were\r\nallowed to attend his Funeral. Dr. Thatcher of the British army attended\r\nhim, a man of great humanity.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Fitch declares that there were two thousand wounded British\r\nand Hessians in the hospitals in New York after the battle of Fort\r\nWashington, which is a much larger estimate than we have found in other\r\naccounts. He says that the day of the battle was Saturday, November\r\n16th, and that the prisoners were not brought to New York until the\r\nMonday following. They were then confined in the Bridewell, as the City\r\nJail was then called, and in several churches. Some of them were soon\r\nafterwards sent on board a prison ship, which was probably the Whitby.\r\n“A number of the officers were sent to our place of confinement; Colonel\r\nRawlings, Colonel Hobby, Major (Otho) Williams, etc. Rawlings and\r\nWilliams were wounded, others were also wounded, among them Lieutenant\r\nHanson (a young Gent’n from Va.) who was Shot through ye Shoulder with a\r\nMusq’t Ball of which wound he Died ye end of Dec’r.\r\n\r\n“Many of ye charitable Inhabitants were denied admittance when they came\r\nto Visit us.”\r\n\r\nOn the twentieth of November most of the officers were set at liberty on\r\nparole. “Ye first Objects of our attention were ye poor men who had been\r\nunhappily Captivated with us. They had been landed about ye same time yt\r\nwe were, and confined in several Churches and other large Buildings\r\nand although we had often Received Intelligence from them with ye most\r\nDeplorable Representation of their Miserable Situation, yet when we came\r\nto visit them we found their sufferings vastly superior to what we had\r\nbeen able to conceive. Nor are words sufficient to convey an Adequate\r\nIdea of their Unparalled Calamity. Well might ye Prophet say, ‘They yt\r\nbe slain with ye sword are better than they yt be slain with hunger, for\r\nthese pine away, etc.’\r\n\r\n“Their appearance in general Rather Resembled dead Corpses than living\r\nmen. Indeed great numbers had already arrived at their long home, and ye\r\nRemainder appeared far advanced on ye same Journey: their accommodations\r\nwere in all respects vastly Inferior to what a New England Farmer would\r\nhave provided for his Cattle, and although ye Commissary pretended to\r\nfurnish them with two thirds of ye allowance of ye King’s Troops, yet\r\nthey were cheated out of one half of that. They were many times entirely\r\nneglected from Day to Day, and received no Provision at all; they were\r\nalso frequently Imposed upon in Regard to ye Quality as well as Quantity\r\nof their provision. Especially in the Necessary article of Bread of\r\nwhich they often received such Rotten and mouldy stuff, as was entirely\r\nunfit for use.\r\n\r\n“* * * A large number of ye most feeble were Removed down to ye Quaker\r\nMeeting House on Queen Street, where many hundreds of them perished in\r\na much more miserable Situation than ye dumb Beasts, while those whose\r\nparticular business it was to provide them relief, paid very little or\r\nno attention to their unparalleled sufferings. This house I understand\r\nwas under ye Superintendence of one Dr. Dibuke * * * who had been\r\nat least once convicted of stealing (in Europe) and had fled to this\r\ncountry for protection: It was said he often made application of his\r\nCane among ye Sick instead of other medicines. * * * I have often been\r\nin danger of being stabbed for attempting to speak to a prisoner in ye\r\nyard. * * *\r\n\r\n“About the 24th December a large number of prisoners were embarked on\r\na ship to be sent to New England. What privates of the 17th Regiment\r\nremained living were Included in this number, but about one half had\r\nalready perished in Prison. I was afterwards informed that the Winds\r\nbeing unfavourable and their accommodations and provisions on board ye\r\nShip being very similar to what they had been provided with before, a\r\nlarge proportion of them perished before they could reach New England,\r\nso that it is to be feared very few of them lived to see their native\r\nhomes.\r\n\r\n“Soon after there was large numbers of the prisoners sent off by land\r\nboth to the Southward and Eastward so yt when ye Officers were Removed\r\nover into Long Island in the latter part of January there remained but\r\nvery few of the privates in that City except those released by Death\r\nwhich number was supposed to be about 1800.\r\n\r\n“General Robertson, so famous for Politeness and Humanity was commanding\r\nOfficer at New York during the aforesaid treatment of the prisoners.\r\nGovernor Scheene was said to have visited the prisoners at the Churches\r\nand manifested great dissatisfaction at their ill Usage, yet I was never\r\nable to learn that ye poor Sufferers Rec’d any Advantage thereby.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Jabez Fitch was a prisoner eighteen months. After the Revolution\r\nhe lived in Vermont, where he died in 1812.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE HOSPITAL DOCTOR--A TORY’S ACCOUNT OF NEW YORK IN 1777--ETHAN ALLEN’S\r\nACCOUNT OF THE PRISONERS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe doctor spoken of by Jabez Fitch as Dr. Dibuke is perhaps the\r\nnotorious character described by Mr. Elias Boudinot in the Journal from\r\nwhich we have already quoted. On page 35 of this book he gives us the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n“AN ACCOUNT OF THE FRENCHMAN WHO POISONED. AMERICAN PRISONERS IN NEW\r\nYORK, AND WAS REWARDED FOR SO DOING BY GENERAL, HOWE\r\n\r\n“When the British Army took possession of New York they found a\r\nFrenchman in Goal, under Condemnation for Burglery and Robbery. He was\r\nliberated. He was a very loos, ignorant man. Had been a Servant. This\r\nfellow was set over our Prisoners in the Hospital, as a Surgeon, though\r\nhe knew not the least principle of the Art. Dr. McHenry, a Physician\r\nof note in the American Army, and then a Prisoner, finding the extreme\r\nignorance of this man, and that he was really murdering our people,\r\nremonstrated to the British Director of the Hospital, and refused\r\nvisiting our sick Prisoners if this man was not dismissed. A British\r\nOfficer, convinced that he had killed several of our People, lodged\r\na complaint against him, when he was ordered to be tryed by a Court\r\nMartial, but the morning before the Court were to set, this Officer was\r\nordered off to St Johns, and the Criminal was discharged for want of\r\nEvidence. During this man having the Charge of our Prisoners in the\r\nHospital, two of our Men deserted from the Hospital and came into our\r\nArmy when they were ordered to me for Examination. They Joined in this\r\nstory. That they were sick in the Hospital under the care of the above\r\nFrenchman. That he came and examined them, and gave to each of them a\r\ndose of Physick to be taken immediately. A Young Woman, their Nurse,\r\nmade them some private signs not to take the Physick immediately. After\r\nthe Doctor was gone, she told them she suspected the Powder was poison.\r\nThat she had several times heard this Frenchman say that he would have\r\nten Rebels dead in such a Room and five dead in such a Room the next\r\nmorning, and it always so happened. They asked her what they should do:\r\nShe told them their only chance was to get off, sick as they were,\r\nthat she would help them out and they must shift for themselves. They\r\naccordingly got off safe, and brought the Physick with them. This was\r\ngiven to a Surgeon’s Mate, who afterwards reported that he gave it to a\r\nDog, and that he died in a very short time. I afterwards saw an account\r\nin a London Paper of this same Frenchman being taken up in England for\r\nsome Crime and condemned to dye. At his Execution he acknowledged the\r\nfact of his having murdered a great number of Rebels in the Hospitals at\r\nNew York by poyson. That on his reporting to General Howe the number\r\nof the Prisoners dead, he raised his pay. He further confessed that he\r\npoisoned the wells used by the American Flying Camp, which caused such\r\nan uncommon Mortality among them in the year 1776.”\r\n\r\nJabez Fitch seems to have been mistaken in thinking that General\r\nRobertson instead of Lord Howe was commanding in New York at this time.\r\n\r\nWe will now give the account written by a Tory gentleman, who lived in\r\nNew York during a part of the Revolution, of Loring, the Commissary of\r\nPrisons, appointed by General Howe in 1776. Judge Thomas Jones was a\r\nnoted loyalist of the day. Finding it inconvenient to remain in this\r\ncountry after the war, he removed to England, where he died in 1792,\r\nhaving first completed his “History of New York during the Revolution.”\r\n He gives a much larger number of prisoners in that city in the year\r\n1776 than do any of the other authorities. We will, however, give his\r\nstatements just as they were written.\r\n\r\n“Upon the close of the campaign in 1776 there were not less than 10,000\r\nprisoners (Sailors included) within the British lines in New York. A\r\nCommissary of Prisoners was therefore appointed, and one Joshua Loring,\r\na Bostonian, was commissioned to the office with a guinea a day, and\r\nrations of all kinds for himself and family. In this appointment there\r\nwas reciprocity. Loring had a handsome wife. The General, Sir William\r\nHowe, was fond of her. Joshua made no objections. He fingered the cash:\r\nthe General enjoyed Madam. Everybody supposing the next campaign (should\r\nthe rebels ever risk another) would put a final period to the rebellion.\r\nLoring was determined to make the most of his commission and by\r\nappropriating to his own use nearly two thirds of the rations allowed\r\nthe prisoners, he actually starved to death about three hundred of the\r\npoor wretches before an exchange took place, and which was not until\r\nFebruary, 1777, and hundreds that were alive at the time were so\r\nemaciated and enfeebled for the want of provisions, that numbers died on\r\nthe road on their way home, and many lived but a few days after reaching\r\ntheir habitations. The war continuing, the Commissaryship of Prisoners\r\ngrew so lucrative that in 1778 the Admiral thought proper to appoint one\r\nfor naval prisoners. Upon the French War a Commissary was appointed for\r\nFrance. When Spain joined France another was appointed for Spain. When\r\nGreat Britain made war upon Holland a Commissary was appointed for\r\nDutch prisoners. Each had his guinea a day, and rations for himself and\r\nfamily. Besides, the prisoners were half starved, as the Commissaries\r\nfilched their provisions, and disposed of them for their own use. It\r\nis a known fact, also, that whenever an exchange was to take place the\r\npreference was given to those who had, or could procure, the most money\r\nto present to the Commissaries who conducted the exchange, by which\r\nmeans large sums of money were unjustly extorted and demanded from the\r\nprisoners at every exchange, to the scandal and disgrace of Britons.\r\nWe had five Commissaries of Prisoners, when one could have done all the\r\nbusiness. Each Commissary had a Deputy, a Clerk, a Messenger in full\r\npay, with rations of every kind.”\r\n\r\nAs Judge Jones was an ardent Tory we would scarcely imagine that he\r\nwould exaggerate in describing the corruptions of the commissaries.\r\nHe greatly deplored the cruelties with which he taxed General Howe and\r\nother officials, and declared that these enormities prevented all hopes\r\nof reconciliation with Great Britain.\r\n\r\nWe will next quote from the “Life of Ethan Allen,” written by himself,\r\nas he describes the condition of the prisoners in the churches in New\r\nYork, more graphically than any of his contemporaries.\r\n\r\n\r\nETHAN ALLEN’S ACCOUNT OF THE AMERICAN PRISONERS\r\n\r\n“Our number, about thirty-four, were all locked up in one common large\r\nroom, without regard to rank, education, or any other accomplishment,\r\nwhere we continued from the setting to the rising sun, and as sundry of\r\nthem were infected with the gaol and other distempers, the furniture\r\nof this spacious room consisted principally of excrement tubs. We\r\npetitioned for a removal of the sick into hospitals, but were denied.\r\nWe remonstrated against the ungenerous usage of being confined with\r\nthe privates, as being contrary to the laws and customs of nations, and\r\nparticularly ungrateful in them, in consequence of the gentleman-like\r\nusage which the British imprisoned officers met with in America; and\r\nthus we wearied ourselves petitioning and remonstrating, but o no\r\npurpose at all; for General Massey, who commanded at Halifax, was as\r\ninflexible as the d---l himself. * * * Among the prisoners were five\r\nwho had a legal claim to a parole, James Lovel, Esq; Captain Francis\r\nProctor; a Mr. Rowland, Master of a Continental armed vessel; a Mr.\r\nTaylor, his mate, and myself. * * * The prisoners were ordered to go\r\non board of a man-of-war, which was bound for New York, but two of them\r\nwere not able to go on board and were left in Halifax: one died and\r\nthe other recovered. This was about the 12th of October, 1776. * * * We\r\narrived before New York and cast an anchor the latter part of October,\r\nwhere we remained several days, and where Captain Smith informed me that\r\nhe had recommended me to Admiral Howe, and General Sir Wm. Howe, as a\r\ngentleman of honor and veracity, and desired that I might be treated\r\nas such. Captain Burk was then ordered on board a prison ship in the\r\nharbor. I took my leave of Captain Smith, and with the other prisoners\r\nwas sent on board a transport ship. * * * Some of the last days of\r\nNovember the prisoners were landed at New York, and I was admitted to\r\nparole with the other officers, viz: Proctor, Rowland, and Taylor.\r\nThe privates were put into the filthy churches in New York, with the\r\ndistressed prisoners that were taken at Fort Washington, and the second\r\nnight Sergeant Roger Moore, who was bold and enterprising, found means\r\nto make his escape, with every of the remaining prisoners that were\r\ntaken with me, except three who were soon after exchanged: so that out\r\nof thirty-one prisoners who went with me the round exhibited in these\r\nsheets, two only died with the enemy, and three only were exchanged, one\r\nof whom died after he came within our lines. All the rest at different\r\ntimes made their escape from the enemy.\r\n\r\n“I now found myself on parole, and restricted to the limits of the\r\ncity of New York, where I soon projected means to live in some measure\r\nagreeable to my rank, though I was destitute of cash. My constitution\r\nwas almost worn out by such a long and barbarous captivity. * * * In\r\nconsequence of a regular diet and exercise my blood recruited, and\r\nmy nerves in a great measure recovered their former tone * * * in the\r\ncourse of six months.\r\n\r\n“* * * Those who had the misfortune to fall into the enemy’s hands at\r\nFort Washington * * * were reserved from immediate death to famish\r\nand die with hunger: in fine the word rebel’ was thought by the enemy\r\nsufficient to sanctify whatever cruelties they were pleased to inflict,\r\ndeath itself not excepted. * * *\r\n\r\n“The prisoners who were brought to New York were crowded into churches,\r\nand environed with slavish Hessian guards, a people of a strange\r\nlanguage * * * and at other times by merciless Britons, whose mode of\r\ncommunicating ideas being unintelligible in this country served only\r\nto tantalize and insult the helpless and perishing; but above all the\r\nhellish delight and triumph of the tories over them, as they were dying\r\nby hundreds. This was too much for me to bear as a spectator; for I saw\r\nthe tories exulting over the dead bodies of their countrymen. I have\r\ngone into the churches and seen sundry of the prisoners in the agonies\r\nof death, in consequence of very hunger; and others speechless and\r\nnear death, biting pieces of chips; others pleading, for God’s sake for\r\nsomething to eat, and at the same time shivering with the cold. Hollow\r\ngroans saluted my ears, and despair seemed to be imprinted on every of\r\ntheir countenances. The filth in these churches, in consequence of the\r\nfluxes, was almost beyond description. I have carefully sought to direct\r\nmy steps so as to avoid it, but could not. They would beg for God’s sake\r\nfor one copper or morsel of bread. I have seen in one of the churches\r\nseven dead, at the same time, lying among the excrements of their\r\nbodies.\r\n\r\n“It was a common practice with the enemy to convey the dead from these\r\nfilthy places in carts, to be slightly buried, and I have seen whole\r\ngangs of tories making derision, and exulting over the dead, saying\r\n‘There goes another load of d----d rebels!’ I have observed the British\r\nsoldiers to be full of their blackguard jokes and vaunting on those\r\noccasions, but they seemed to me to be less malignant than the Tories.\r\n\r\n“The provision dealt out to the prisoners was by no means sufficient for\r\nthe support of life. It was deficient in Quantity, and much more so in\r\nQuality. The prisoners often presented me with a sample of their bread,\r\nwhich I certify was damaged to such a degree that it was loathsome and\r\nunfit to be eaten, and I am bold to aver it as my opinion, that it had\r\nbeen condemned and was of the very worst sort. I have seen and been\r\nfed upon damaged bread, in the course of my captivity, and observed the\r\nquality of such bread as has been condemned by the enemy, among which\r\nwas very little so effectually spoiled as what was dealt out to these\r\nprisoners. Their allowance of meat, as they told me, was quite trifling\r\nand of the basest sort. I never saw any of it, but was informed, bad as\r\nit was, it was swallowed almost as quick as they got hold of it. I saw\r\nsome of them sucking bones after they were speechless; others who could\r\nyet speak and had the use of their reason, urged me in the strongest\r\nand most pathetic manner, to use my interest in their behalf: ‘For you\r\nplainly see,’ said they, ‘that we are devoted to death and destruction,’\r\nand after I had examined more particularly into their truly deplorable\r\ncondition and had become more fully apprized of the essential facts, I\r\nwas persuaded that it was a premeditated and systematized plan of the\r\nBritish council to destroy the youths of our land, with a view thereby\r\nto deter the country and make it submit to their despotism: but as I\r\ncould not do them any material service, and by any public attempt for\r\nthat purpose I might endanger myself by frequenting places the most\r\nnauseous and contagious that could be conceived of, I refrained going\r\ninto the churches, but frequently conversed with such of the prisoners\r\nas were admitted to come out into the yard, and found that the\r\nsystematical usage still continued. The guard would often drive me away\r\nwith their fixed bayonets. A Hessian one day followed me five or six\r\nrods, but by making use of my legs, I got rid of the lubber.\r\n\r\n“Sometimes I could obtain a little conversation notwithstanding their\r\nseverities.\r\n\r\n“I was in one of the yards and it was rumoured among those in the\r\nchurch, and sundry of the prisoners came with their usual complaints to\r\nme, and among the rest a large-boned, tall young man, as he told me from\r\nPennsylvania, who was reduced to a mere skeleton. He said he was glad\r\nto see me before he died, which he had expected to have done last night,\r\nbut was a little revived. He further informed me that he and his brother\r\nhad been urged to enlist into the British army, but had both resolved to\r\ndie first; that his brother had died last night, in consequence of that\r\nresolve, and that he expected shortly to follow him; but I made the\r\nother prisoners stand a little off and told him with a low voice to\r\nenlist; he then asked whether it was right in the sight of God? I\r\nassured him that it was, and that duty to himself obliged him to deceive\r\nthe British by enlisting and deserting the first opportunity; upon which\r\nhe answered with transport that he would enlist. I charged him not to\r\nmention my name as his adviser, lest it should get air and I should be\r\nclosely confined, in consequence of it.\r\n\r\n“The integrity of these suffering prisoners is incredible. Many hundreds\r\nof them, I am confident, submitted to death rather than enlist in the\r\nBritish service, which, I am informed, they most generally were\r\npressed to do. I was astonished at the resolution of the two brothers,\r\nparticularly; it seems that they could not be stimulated to such\r\nexertions of heroism from ambition, as they were but obscure soldiers.\r\nStrong indeed must the internal principle of virtue be which supported\r\nthem to brave death, and one of them went through the operation, as did\r\nmany hundreds others * * * These things will have their proper effect\r\nupon the generous and brave.\r\n\r\n“The officers on parole were most of them zealous, if possible, to\r\nafford the miserable soldiers relief, and often consulted with one\r\nanother on the subject, but to no effect, being destitute of the means\r\nof subsistence which they needed, nor could they project any measure\r\nwhich they thought would alter their fate, or so much as be a mean of\r\ngetting them out of those filthy places to the privilege of fresh air.\r\nSome projected that all the officers should go in procession to General\r\nHowe and plead the cause of the perishing soldiers, but this proposal\r\nwas negatived for the following reasons: viz: because that General Howe\r\nmust needs be well acquainted and have a thorough knowledge of the state\r\nand condition of the prisoners in every of their wretched apartments,\r\nand that much more particular and exact than any officer on parole could\r\nbe supposed to have, as the General had a return of the circumstances of\r\nthe prisoners by his own officers every morning, of the number who\r\nwere alive, as also of the number who died every twenty-four hours: and\r\nconsequently the bill of mortality, as collected from the daily returns,\r\nlay before him with all the material situations and circumstances of the\r\nprisoners, and provided the officers should go in procession to General\r\nHowe, according to the projection, it would give him the greatest\r\naffront, and that he would either retort upon them, that it was no part\r\nof their parole to instruct him in his conduct to prisoners; that\r\nthey were mutinying against his authority, and, by affronting him, had\r\nforfeited their parole, or that, more probably, instead of saying one\r\nword to them, would order them all into as wretched a confinement as the\r\nsoldiers whom they sought to relieve, for at that time the British, from\r\nthe General to the private centinel, were in full confidence, nor did\r\nthey so much as hesitate, but that they should conquer the country.\r\n\r\n“Thus the consultation of the officers was confounded and broken to\r\npieces, in consequence of the dread which at the time lay on their minds\r\nof offending General Howe; for they conceived so murderous a tryant\r\nwould not be too good to destroy even the officers on the least pretence\r\nof an affront, as they were equally in his power with the soldiers;\r\nand as General Howe perfectly understood the condition of the private\r\nsoldiers, it was argued that it was exactly such as he and his council\r\nhad devised, and as he meant to destroy them it would be to no purpose\r\nfor them to try to dissuade him from it, as they were helpless and\r\nliable to the same fate, on giving the least affront. Indeed anxious\r\napprehensions disturbed them in their then circumstances.\r\n\r\n“Meantime mortality raged to such an intolerable degree among the\r\nprisoners that the very school boys in the street knew the mental design\r\nof it in some measure; at least they knew that they were starved\r\nto death. Some poor women contributed to their necessity till their\r\nchildren were almost starved; and all persons of common understanding\r\nknew that they were devoted to the cruellest and worst of deaths.\r\n\r\n“It was also proposed by some to make a written representation of the\r\ncondition of the soldiery, and the officers to sign it, and that it\r\nshould be couched in such terms, as though they were apprehensive that\r\nthe General was imposed upon by his officers, in their daily returns to\r\nhim of the state and condition of the prisoners, and that therefor the\r\nofficers moved with compassion, were constrained to communicate to him\r\nthe facts relative to them, nothing doubting but that they would meet\r\nwith a speedy redress; but this proposal was most generally negatived\r\nalso, and for much the same reason offered in the other case; for it was\r\nconjectured that General Howe’s indignation would be moved against such\r\nofficers as should attempt to whip him over his officers’ backs; that he\r\nwould discern that he himself was really struck at, and not the officers\r\nwho made the daily returns; and therefor self preservation deterred\r\nthe officers from either petitioning or remonstrating to General Howe,\r\neither verbally or in writing; as also they considered that no valuable\r\npurpose to the distressed would be obtained.\r\n\r\n“I made several rough drafts on the subject, one of which I exhibited\r\nto the Colonels Magaw, Miles, and Atlee; and they said that they would\r\nconsider the matter. Soon after I called on them, and some of the\r\ngentlemen informed me that they had written to the General on the\r\nsubject, and I concluded that the gentlemen thought it best that they\r\nshould write without me, as there was such spirited aversion subsisting\r\nbetween the British and me.”\r\n\r\nEthan Allen goes on to say: “Our little army was retreating in New\r\nJersey and our young men murdered by hundreds in New York.” He then\r\nspeaks of Washington’s success at Trenton in the following terms: “This\r\nsuccess had a mighty effect on General Howe and his council, and\r\nroused them to a sense of their own weakness. * * * Their obduracy and\r\ndeath-designing malevolence in some measure abated or was suspended.\r\nThe prisoners, who were condemned to the most wretched and cruellest\r\nof deaths, and who survived to this period, _though most of them died\r\nbefore,_ were immediately ordered to be sent within General Washington’s\r\nlines, for an exchange, and in consequence of it were taken out of their\r\nfilthy and poisonous places of confinement, and sent out of New York to\r\ntheir friends in haste. Several of them fell dead in the streets of New\r\nYork, as they attempted to walk to the vessels in the harbor, for their\r\nintended embarkation. What number lived to reach the lines I cannot\r\nascertain, but, from concurrent representations which I have since\r\nreceived from numbers of people who lived in and adjacent to such parts\r\nof the country, where they were received from the enemy, _I apprehend\r\nthat most of them died in consequence of the vile usage of the enemy._\r\nSome who were eye witnesses of the scene of mortality, more especially\r\nin that part which continued after the exchange took place, are of\r\nopinion that it was partly in consequence of a slow poison; but this\r\nI refer to the doctors who attended them, who are certainly the best\r\njudges.\r\n\r\n“Upon the best calculation I have been able to make from personal\r\nknowledge, and the many evidences I have collected in support of the\r\nfacts, I learn that, of the prisoners taken on Long Island and Fort\r\nWashington and some few others, at different times and places, about\r\ntwo thousand perished with hunger, cold, and sickness, occasioned by the\r\nfilth of their prisons, at New York; and a number more on their passage\r\nto the continental lines; most of the residue who reached their\r\nfriends having received their death wound, could not be restored by\r\nthe assistance of their physicians and friends: but like their brother\r\nprisoners, fell a sacrifice to the relentless and scientific barbarity\r\nof the British. I took as much pains as the circumstances would admit of\r\nto inform myself not only of matters of fact, but likewise of the very\r\ndesign and aims of General Howe and his council, the latter of which I\r\npredicated on the former, and submit it to the candid public.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE ACCOUNT OF ALEXANDER GRAYDON\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting and best memoirs of revolutionary times is\r\nthat written by Alexander Graydon, and as he was taken prisoner at Fort\r\nWashington, and closely connected with the events in New York during the\r\nwinter of 1776-7, we will quote here his account of his captivity.\r\n\r\nHe describes the building of Fort Washington in July of 1776 by the men\r\nof Magaw’s and Hand’s regiments. General Putnam was the engineer. It was\r\npoorly built for defence, and not adapted for a siege.\r\n\r\nGraydon was a captain in Colonel Shee’s Regiment, but, for some reason\r\nor other, Shee went home just before the battle was fought, and his\r\ntroops were commanded by Cadwallader in his stead. Graydon puts the\r\nnumber of privates taken prisoner at 2706 and the officers at about 210.\r\nBedinger, as we have already seen, states that there were 2673 privates\r\nand 210 officers. He was a man of painstaking accuracy, and it is\r\nquite probable that his account is the most trustworthy. As one of the\r\nprivates was Bedinger’s own young brother, a boy of fifteen, whom he\r\nundoubtedly visited as often as possible, while Graydon only went\r\nonce to the prisons, perhaps Bedinger had the best opportunities for\r\ncomputing the number of captives.\r\n\r\nGraydon says that Colonel Rawlings was, some time late in the morning\r\nof the 16th of November, attacked by the Hessians, when he fought with\r\ngreat gallantry and effect as they were climbing the heights, until the\r\narms of the riflemen became useless from the foulness they contracted\r\nfrom the frequent repetition of their fire.\r\n\r\nGraydon, himself, becoming separated from his own men, mistook a party\r\nof Highlanders for them, and was obliged to surrender to them. He\r\nwas put under charge of a Scotch sergeant, who said to him and his\r\ncompanion, Forrest: “Young men, ye should never fight against your\r\nKing!”\r\n\r\nJust then a British officer rode up at full gallop exclaiming, “What!\r\ntaking prisoners! Kill them, Kill every man of them!”\r\n\r\n“My back was towards him when he spoke,” says Graydon, “and although\r\nby this time there was none of that appearance of ferocity in the guard\r\nwhich would induce much fear that they would execute his command, I yet\r\nthought it well enough to parry it, and turning to him, I took off my\r\nhat, saying, ‘Sir, I put myself under your protection!’\r\n\r\n“No man was ever more effectually rebuked. His manner was instantly\r\nsoftened; he met my salutation with an inclination of his body, and\r\nafter a civil question or two, as if to make amends for his sanguinary\r\nmandate, rode off towards the fort, to which he had enquired the way.\r\n\r\n“Though I had delivered up my arms I had not adverted to a cartouche\r\nbox which I wore about my waist, and which, having once belonged to\r\nhis British Majesty, presented in front the gilded letters, G. R.\r\nExasperated at this trophy on the body of a rebel, one of the soldiers\r\nseized the belt with great violence, and in the act to unbuckle it, had\r\nnearly jerked me off my legs. To appease the offended loyalty of the\r\nhonest Scot I submissively took it off and handed it to him, being\r\nconscious that I had no longer any right to it. At this moment a Hessian\r\ncame up. He was not a private, neither did he look like a regular\r\nofficer. He was some retainer, however, to the German troops, and as\r\nmuch of a brute as any one I have ever seen in human form. The wretch\r\ncame near enough to elbow us, and, half unsheathing his sword, with a\r\ncountenance that bespoke a most vehement desire to use it against us, he\r\ngrunted out in broken English, ‘Eh! you rebel! you damn rebel!’\r\n\r\n“I had by this time entire confidence in our Scotchmen, and therefore\r\nregarded the caitiff with the same indifference that I should have\r\nviewed a caged wild beast, though with much greater abhorrence. * * *\r\n\r\n“We were marched to an old stable, where we found about forty or fifty\r\nprisoners already collected, principally officers, of whom I only\r\nparticularly recollect Lieutenant Brodhead of our battalion. We remained\r\non the outside of the building; and, for nearly an hour, sustained a\r\nseries of the most intolerable abuse. This was chiefly from the officers\r\nof the light infantry, for the most part young and insolent puppies,\r\nwhose worthlessness was apparently their recommendation to a service,\r\nwhich placed them in the post of danger, and in the way of becoming\r\nfood for powder, their most appropriate destination next to that of the\r\ngallows. The term ‘rebel,’ with the epithet ‘damned’ before it, was\r\nthe mildest we received. We were twenty times told, sometimes with\r\na taunting affectation of concern, that we should every man of us be\r\nhanged. * * * The indignity of being ordered about by such contemptible\r\nwhipsters, for a moment unmanned me, and I was obliged to apply my\r\nhandkerchief to my eyes. This was the first time in my life that I had\r\nbeen the victim of brutal, cowardly oppression, and I was unequal to the\r\nshock; but my elasticity of mind was soon restored, and I viewed it with\r\nthe indignant contempt it deserved.\r\n\r\n“For the greater convenience of guarding us we were now removed to the\r\nbarn of Colonel Morris’s house, which had been the head-quarters of our\r\narmy. * * * It was a good, new building. * * * There were from a hundred\r\nand fifty to two hundred, comprising a motley group, to be sure. Men and\r\nofficers of all descriptions, regulars and militia, troops continental\r\nand state, and some in hunting shirts, the mortal aversion of a red\r\ncoat. Some of the officers had been plundered of their hats, and some\r\nof their coats, and upon the new society into which we were introduced,\r\nwith whom a showy exterior was all in all, we were certainly not\r\ncalculated to make a very favorable impression. I found Captain Tudor\r\nhere, of our regiment, who, if I mistake not, had lost his hat. * * * It\r\nwas announced, by an huzza, that the fort had surrendered.\r\n\r\n“The officer who commanded the guard in whose custody we now were, was\r\nan ill-looking, low-bred fellow of this dashing corps of light infantry.\r\n* * * As I stood as near as possible to the door for the sake of air,\r\nthe enclosure in which we were being extremely crowded and unpleasant,\r\nI was particularly exposed to his brutality; and repelling with some\r\nseverity one of his attacks, for I was becoming desperate and careless\r\nof safety, the ruffian exclaimed, ‘Not a word, sir, or damme, I’ll give\r\nyou my butt!’ at the same time clubbing his fusee, and drawing it back\r\nas if to give the blow, I fully expected it, but he contented himself\r\nwith the threat. I observed to him that I was in his power, and disposed\r\nto submit to it, though not proof against every provocation. * * * There\r\nwere several British officers present, when a Serjeant-Major came to\r\ntake an account of us, and particularly a list of such of us as were\r\nofficers. This Serjeant, though not uncivil, had all that animated,\r\ndegagè impudence of air, which belongs to a self complacent,\r\nnon-commissioned officer of the most arrogant army in the world; and\r\nwith his pen in his hand and his paper on his knee applied to each of\r\nus in his turn for his rank. * * * The sentinels were withdrawn to the\r\ndistance of about ten or twelve feet, and we were told that such of us\r\nas were officers might walk before the door. This was a great relief to\r\nus.”\r\n\r\nThe officers were lodged in the barn loft quite comfortably. A young\r\nLieutenant Beckwith had them in charge, and was a humane gentleman. In\r\nthe evening he told them he would send them, if possible, a bottle of\r\nwine, but at any rate, a bottle of spirits. He kept his word as to the\r\nspirits, which was all the supper the party in the loft had. “In the\r\nmorning a soldier brought me Mr. B.’s compliments, and an invitation\r\nto come down and breakfast with him. * * * I thankfully accepted his\r\ninvitation, and took with me Forrest and Tudor. * * * He gave us a dish\r\nof excellent coffee, with plenty of very good toast, which was the only\r\nmorsel we had eaten for the last twenty-four hours. * * * Our fellow\r\nsufferers got nothing until next morning. * * *\r\n\r\n“All the glory that was going (in the battle of Fort Washington) had, in\r\nmy idea of what had passed, been engrossed by the regiment of Rawlings,\r\nwhich had been actively engaged, killed a number of the enemy, and lost\r\nmany themselves.\r\n\r\n“About two o’clock Mr. B. sent me a plate amply supplied with corned\r\nbeef, cabbage, and the leg and wing of a turkey, with bread in\r\nproportion.”\r\n\r\nThough Mr. Graydon calls this gentleman Mr. Becket, it seems that there\r\nwas no young officer of that name at the battle of Fort Washington.\r\nBecket appears to be a mistake for Lieutenant Onslow Beckwith. The\r\nprisoners were now marched within six miles of New York and Graydon’s\r\nparty of officers were well quartered in a house. “Here,” he continues,\r\n“for the first time we drew provisions for the famished soldiers. * *\r\n* Previously to entering the city we were drawn up for about an hour on\r\nthe high ground near the East River. Here, the officers being separated\r\nfrom the men, we were conducted into a church, where we signed a\r\nparole.”\r\n\r\nAt this place a non-commissioned British officer, who had seen him at\r\nthe ordinary kept by his widowed mother in Philadelphia, when he was a\r\nboy, insisted on giving him a dollar.\r\n\r\n“Quarters were assigned for us in the upper part of the town, in what\r\nwas called ‘The holy ground.’ * * * I ventured to take board at four\r\ndollars per week with a Mrs. Carroll. * * * Colonel Magaw, Major West,\r\nand others, boarded with me.”\r\n\r\nHe was fortunate in obtaining his trunk and mattress. Speaking of the\r\nprisons in which the privates were confined he says: “I once and\r\nonce only ventured to penetrate into these abodes of human misery and\r\ndespair. But to what purpose repeat my visit, when I had neither relief\r\nto administer nor comfort to bestow? * * * I endeavoured to comfort them\r\nwith the hope of exchange, but humanity forbade me to counsel them to\r\nrush on sure destruction. * * * Our own condition was a paradise to\r\ntheirs. * * * Thousands of my unhappy countrymen were consigned to slow,\r\nconsuming tortures, equally fatal and potent to destruction.”\r\n\r\nThe American officers on parole in New York prepared a memorial to Sir\r\nWilliam Howe on the condition of these wretched sufferers, and it was\r\nsigned by Colonels Magaw, Miles, and Atlee. This is, no doubt, the paper\r\nof which Colonel Ethan Allen writes. Captain Graydon was commissioned to\r\ndeliver this document to Sir William Howe. He says: “The representation\r\nwhich had been submitted to General Howe in behalf of the suffering\r\nprisoners was more successful than had been expected. * * * The\r\npropositions had been considered by Sir William Howe, and he was\r\ndisposed to accede to them. These were that the men should be sent\r\nwithin our lines, where they should be receipted for, and an equal\r\nnumber of the prisoners in our hands returned in exchange. * * * Our\r\nmen, no longer soldiers (their terms for which they had enlisted having\r\nexpired) and too debilitated for service, gave a claim to sound men,\r\nimmediately fit to take the field, and there was moreover great danger\r\nthat if they remained in New York the disease with which they were\r\ninfected might be spread throughout the city. At any rate hope was\r\nadmitted into the mansions of despair, the prison doors were thrown\r\nopen, and the soldiers who were yet alive and capable of being moved\r\nwere conveyed to our nearest posts, under the care of our regimental\r\nsurgeons, to them a fortunate circumstance, since it enabled them to\r\nexchange the land of bondage for that of liberty. * * * Immediately\r\nafter the release of our men a new location was assigned to us. On the\r\n22nd of January, 1777, we were removed to Long Island.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nA FOUL PAGE OF ENGLISH HISTORY\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will not follow Mr. Graydon now to Long Island. It was then late in\r\nJanuary, 1777. The survivors of the American prisoners were, many\r\nof them, exchanged for healthy British soldiers. The crime had been\r\ncommitted, one of the blackest which stains the annals of English\r\nhistory. By the most accurate computation at least two thousand helpless\r\nAmerican prisoners had been slowly starved, frozen, or poisoned to death\r\nin the churches and other prisons in New York.\r\n\r\nNo excuse for this monstrous crime can be found, even by those who are\r\nanxiously in search of an adequate one.\r\n\r\nWe have endeavored to give some faint idea of the horrors of that\r\nhopeless captivity. As we have already said scarcely any one who endured\r\nimprisonment for any length of time in the churches lived to tell the\r\ntale. One of these churches was standing not many years ago, and the\r\nmarks of bayonet thrusts might plainly be seen upon its pillars. What\r\nterrible deeds were enacted there we can only conjecture. We _know_ that\r\ntwo thousand, healthy, high-spirited young men, many of them sons of\r\ngentlemen, and all patriotic, brave, and long enduring, even unto death,\r\nwere foully murdered in these places of torment, compared to which\r\nordinary captivity is described by one who endured it as paradise. We\r\nknow, we say, that these young men perished awfully, rather than enlist\r\nin the British army; that posterity has almost forgotten them, and\r\nthat their dreadful sufferings ought to be remembered wherever American\r\nhistory is read.\r\n\r\nWe have already said that it is impossible now to obtain the names of\r\nall who suffered death at the hands of their inhuman jailors during the\r\nfall and winter of 1776-7. But we have taken Captain Abraham Shepherd’s\r\ncompany of riflemen as a sample of the prisoners, and are able, thanks\r\nto the pay roll now in our care, to indicate the fate of each man upon\r\nthe list.\r\n\r\nIt is a mistake to say that no prisoners deserted to the British. After\r\nthe account we have quoted from Ethan Allen’s book we feel sure that\r\nno one can find the heart to blame the poor starving creatures who\r\nendeavored to preserve their remains of life in this manner.\r\n\r\nHenry Bedinger gives the names of seven men of this company who\r\ndeserted. They are Thomas Knox, a corporal; William Anderson, Richard\r\nNeal, George Taylor, Moses McComesky, Anthony Blackhead and Anthony\r\nLarkin. Thomas Knox did not join the British forces until the 17th of\r\nJanuary, 1777; William Anderson on the 20th of January, 1777. Richard\r\nNeal left the American army on the tenth of August, 1776. He, therefore,\r\nwas not with the regiment at Fort Washington. George Taylor deserted\r\non the 9th of July, 1776, which was nine days after he enlisted. Moses\r\nMcComesky did not desert until the 14th of June, 1777. Anthony Blackhead\r\ndeserted November 15th, 1776, the day before the battle was fought;\r\nAnthony Larkin, September 15th, 1776. We cannot tell what became of any\r\nof these men. Those who died of the prisoners are no less than fifty-two\r\nin this one company of seventy-nine privates and non-commissioned\r\nofficers. This may and probably does include a few who lived to be\r\nexchanged. The date of death of each man is given, but not the place in\r\nwhich he died.\r\n\r\nA very singular fact about this record is that no less than _seventeen_\r\nof the prisoners of this company died on the same day, which was the\r\nfifteenth of February, 1777. Why this was so we cannot tell. We can\r\nonly leave the cause of their death to the imagination of our readers.\r\nWhether they were poisoned by wholesale; whether they were murdered in\r\nattempting to escape; whether the night being extraordinarily severe,\r\nthey froze to death; whether they were butchered by British bayonets, we\r\nare totally unable to tell. The record gives their names and the date of\r\ndeath and says that all seventeen were prisoners. That is all.\r\n\r\nThe names of these men are Jacob Wine, William Waller, Peter Snyder,\r\nConrad Rush, David Harmon, William Moredock, William Wilson, James\r\nWilson, Thomas Beatty, Samuel Davis, John Cassody, Peter Good, John\r\nNixon, Christopher Peninger, Benjamin McKnight, John McSwaine, James\r\nGriffith, and Patrick Murphy.\r\n\r\nTwo or three others are mentioned as dying the day after. Is it possible\r\nthat these men were on board one of the prison ships which was set on\r\nfire? If so we have been able to discover no account of such a disaster\r\non that date.\r\n\r\nMany of the papers of Major Henry Bedinger were destroyed. It is\r\npossible that he may have left some clue to the fate of these men, but\r\nif so it is probably not now in existence. But among the letters and\r\nmemoranda written by him which have been submitted to us for inspection,\r\nis a list, written on a scrap of paper, of the men that he recruited for\r\nCaptain Shepherd’s Company in the summer of 1776. This paper gives the\r\nnames of the men and the date on which each one died in prison. It is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF MEN RAISED BY LIEUTENANT HENRY BEDINGER, AND THAT HE BROUGHT\r\nFROM NEW TOWN, BERKELEY COUNTY, VA., AUGUST FIRST, 1776\r\n\r\nDennis Bush, Fourth Sergeant. (He was taken prisoner at Fort Washington,\r\nbut lived to be exchanged, and was paid up to October 1st, 1778, at the\r\nend of the term for which the company enlisted.)\r\n\r\nConrad Cabbage, Prisoner, Died, Jan. 7th, 1777. John Cummins, Prisoner,\r\nDied, Jan. 27th, 1777. Gabriel Stevens, Prisoner, Died, March 1st,\r\n1777. William Donally, Prisoner, Died, Jan. 10th, 1777. David Gilmer,\r\nPrisoner, Died, Jan. 26th, 1777. John Cassady, Prisoner, Died, Feb.\r\n15th, 1777. Samuel Brown, Prisoner, Died, Feb. 26th, 1777. Peter Good,\r\nPrisoner, Died, Feb. 13th, 1777. William Boyle, Prisoner, Died, Feb.\r\n25th, 1777. John Nixon, Prisoner, Died, Feb. 18th, 1777. Anthony\r\nBlackhead, deserted, Nov. 15th, 1776. William Case, Prisoner, Died,\r\nMarch 15th, 1777. Caspar Myres, Prisoner, Died, Feb. 16th, 1777. William\r\nSeaman, Prisoner, Died, July 8th, 1777. Isaac Price, Prisoner, Died,\r\nFeb. 5th, 1777. Samuel Davis, Prisoner, Died, Feb. 15th, 1777.\r\n\r\nWilliam Seaman was the son of Jonah Seaman, living near Darkesville.\r\nIsaac Price was an orphan, living with James’ Campbell’s father. Samuel\r\nDavis came from near Charlestown.\r\n\r\nHenry Bedinger.\r\n\r\nThis is all, but it is eloquent with what it does not say. All but two\r\nof this list of seventeen young, vigorous riflemen died in prison or\r\nfrom the effects of confinement. One, alone had sufficient vitality to\r\nendure until the 8th of July, 1777. Perhaps he was more to be pitied\r\nthan his comrades.\r\n\r\nWe now begin to understand how it happened that, out of more than 2,600\r\nprivates taken prisoner at Fort Washington, 1,900 were dead in the space\r\nof two months and four days, when the exchange of some of the survivors\r\ntook place. Surely this is a lasting disgrace to one of the greatest\r\nnations of the world. If, as seems undoubtedly true, more men perished\r\nin prison than on the battle fields of the Revolution, it is difficult\r\nto see why so little is made of this fact in the many histories of that\r\nstruggle that have been written. We find that the accounts of British\r\nprisons are usually dismissed in a few words, sometimes in an appendix,\r\nor a casual note. But history was ever written thus. Great victories are\r\nelaborately described; and all the pomp and circumstance of war is set\r\ndown for our pleasure and instruction. But it is due to the grand solemn\r\nmuse of history, who carries the torch of truth, that the other side,\r\nthe horrors of war, should be as faithfully delineated. Wars will not\r\ncease until the lessons of their cruelty, their barbarity, and the dark\r\ntrail of suffering they leave behind them are deeply impressed upon\r\nthe mind. It is our painful task to go over the picture, putting in the\r\nshadows as we see them, however gloomy may be the effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nA BOY IN PRISON\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1761 a boy was born in a German settlement near\r\nLancaster, Pennsylvania, the third son of Henry Bedinger and his wife,\r\nwhose maiden name was Magdalene von Schlegel. These Germans, whom we\r\nhave already mentioned, moved, in 1762, to the neighborhood of the\r\nlittle hamlet, then called Mecklenburg, Berkeley County, Virginia.\r\nAfterwards the name of the town was changed to Shepherdstown, in honor\r\nof its chief proprietor, Thomas Shepherd.\r\n\r\nDaniel was a boy of fourteen when the first company of riflemen was\r\nraised at Shepherdstown by the gallant young officer, Captain Hugh\r\nStephenson, in 1775.\r\n\r\nThe rendezvous of this company was the spring on his mother’s farm, then\r\ncalled Bedinger’s Spring, where the clear water gushes out of a great\r\nrock at the foot of an ancient oak. The son of Daniel Bedinger, Hon.\r\nHenry Bedinger, Minister to the Court of Denmark in 1853, left a short\r\naccount of his father’s early history, which we will quote in this\r\nplace. He says: “When the war of the Revolution commenced my father’s\r\neldest brother Henry was about twenty-two years of age. His next\r\nbrother, Michael, about nineteen, and he himself only in his fifteenth\r\nyear. Upon the first news of hostilities his two brothers joined a\r\nvolunteer company under the command of Captain Hugh Stephenson, and set\r\noff immediately to join the army at Cambridge.\r\n\r\n“My father himself was extremely anxious to accompany them, but they and\r\nhis mother, who was a widow, forbade his doing so, telling him he was\r\nentirely too young, and that he must stay at home and take care of his\r\nyounger brothers and sisters. And he was thus very reluctantly compelled\r\nto remain at home. At the expiration of about twelve months his brothers\r\nreturned home, and when the time for their second departure had arrived,\r\nthe wonderful tales they had narrated of their life in camp had wrought\r\nso upon my father’s youthful and ardent imagination that he besought\r\nthem and his mother with tears in his eyes, to suffer him to accompany\r\nthem. But they, regarding his youth, would not give their consent, but\r\ntook their departure without him.\r\n\r\n“However, the second night after their arrival in camp (which was at\r\nBergen, New Jersey), they were astonished by the arrival of my father,\r\nhe having run off from home and followed them all the way on foot, and\r\nnow appeared before them, haggard and weary and half starved by the\r\nlengths of his march. * * * My father was taken prisoner at the battle\r\nof Fort Washington, and the privations and cruel treatment which he then\r\nunderwent gave a blow to his constitution from which he never recovered.\r\nAfter the close of the Revolution he returned home with a constitution\r\nmuch shattered. * * *”\r\n\r\nMany years after the Revolution Dr. Draper, who died in Madison,\r\nWisconsin, and left his valuable manuscripts to the Historical Society\r\nof that State, interviewed an old veteran of the war, in Kentucky. This\r\nvenerable relic of the Revolution was Major George Michael Bedinger, a\r\nbrother of Daniel. Dr. Draper took down from his lips a short account\r\nof the battle of Fort Washington, where his two brothers were captured.\r\nMajor G. M. Bedinger was not in service at that time, but must have\r\nreceived the account from one or both of his brothers. Dr. Draper\r\nsays: “In the action of Fort Washington Henry Bedinger heard a Hessian\r\ncaptain, having been repulsed, speak to his riflemen in his own\r\nlanguage, telling them to follow his example and reserve their fire\r\nuntil they were close. Bedinger, recognizing his mother tongue, watched\r\nthe approach of the Hessian officer, and each levelled his unerring\r\nrifle at the other. Both fired, Bedinger was wounded in the finger: the\r\nball passing, cut off a lock of his hair. The Hessian was shot through\r\nthe head, and instantly expired. Captain Bedinger’s young brother\r\nDaniel, in his company, then but a little past fifteen, shot\r\ntwenty-seven rounds, and was often heard to say, after discharging his\r\npiece, ‘There! take that, you----!’\r\n\r\n“His youthful intrepidity, and gallant conduct, so particularly\r\nattracted the attention of the officers, that, though taken prisoner, he\r\nwas promoted to an ensigncy, his commission dating back six months that\r\nhe might take precedence of the other ensigns of his company.\r\n\r\n“These two brothers remained prisoners, the youngest but a few months,\r\nand the elder nearly four years, both on prison ships, with the most\r\ncruel treatment, in filthy holds, impure atmosphere, and stinted\r\nallowance of food. With such treatment it was no wonder that but eight\r\nhundred out of the 2800 prisoners taken at Fort Washington survived.\r\n\r\n“During the captivity of his brother Henry, Major Bedinger would\r\nby labor, loans at different times, and the property sold which he\r\ninherited from his father, procure money to convey to the British\r\nCommissary of Prisoners to pay his brother Henry’s board. Then he was\r\nreleased from the filthy prison ship, limited on his parole of honor to\r\ncertain limits at Flatbush, and decently provisioned and better treated,\r\nand it is pleasant to add that the British officers having charge of\r\nthese matters were faithful in the proper application of funds thus\r\nplaced in their hands. Major Bedinger made many trips on this labor of\r\nfraternal affection. This, with his attention to his mother and family,\r\nkept him from regularly serving in the army. But he, never the less,\r\nwould make short tours of service.”\r\n\r\nSo far we have quoted Dr. Draper’s recollections of an interview with\r\nGeorge Michael Bedinger in his extreme old age. We have already given\r\nHenry Bedinger’s own acount of his captivity. What we know of Daniel’s\r\nfar severer treatment we will give in our own words.\r\n\r\nIt was four days before the privates taken at Fort Washington had one\r\nmorsel to eat. They were then given a little mouldy biscuit and raw\r\npork. They were marched to New York, and Daniel was lodged with many\r\nothers, perhaps with the whole company, in the Old Sugar House on\r\nLiberty Street. Here he very nearly died of exposure and starvation.\r\nThere was no glass in the windows and scarce one of the prisoners was\r\nproperly clothed. When it snowed they were drifted over as they slept.\r\n\r\nOne day Daniel discovered in some vats a deposit of sugar which he was\r\nglad to scrape to sustain life. A gentleman, confined with him in the\r\nOld Sugar House, used to tell his descendants that the most terrible\r\nfight he ever engaged in was a struggle with a comrade in prison for the\r\ncarcass of a decayed rat.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that Henry Bedinger, an officer on parole in New York,\r\nmay have found some means of communicating with his young brother, and\r\neven of supplying him, sometimes, with food. Daniel, however, was soon\r\nput on board a prison ship, probably the Whitby, in New York harbor.\r\n\r\nBefore the first exchange was effected the poor boy had yielded to\r\ndespair, and had turned his face to the wall, to die. How bitterly he\r\nmust have regretted the home he had been so ready to leave a few months\r\nbefore! And now the iron had eaten into his soul, and he longed for\r\ndeath, as the only means of release from his terrible sufferings.\r\n\r\nDaniel’s father was born in Alsace, and he himself had been brought up\r\nin a family where German was the familiar language of the household.\r\nIt seems that, in some way, probably by using his mother tongue, he had\r\ntouched the heart of one of the Hessian guards. When the officers\r\nin charge went among the prisoners, selecting those who were to be\r\nexchanged, they twice passed the poor boy as too far gone to be moved.\r\nBut he, with a sudden revival of hope and the desire to live, begged and\r\nentreated the Hessian so pitifully not to leave him behind, that that\r\nyoung man, who is said to have been an officer, declared that he would\r\nbe responsible for him, had him lifted and laid down in the bottom of\r\na boat, as he was too feeble to sit or stand. In this condition he\r\naccompanied the other prisoners to a church in New York where the\r\nexchange was effected. One or more of the American surgeons accompanied\r\nthe prisoners. In some way Daniel was conveyed to Philadelphia, where he\r\ncompletely collapsed, and was taken to one of the military hospitals.\r\n\r\nHere, about the first of January, 1777, his devoted brother, George\r\nMichael Bedinger, found him. Major Bedinger’s son, Dr. B. F. Bedinger,\r\nwrote an account of the meeting of these two brothers for Mrs. H. B.\r\nLee, one of Daniel’s daughters, which tells the rest of the story. He\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“My father went to the hospital in search of his brother, but did not\r\nrecognize him. On inquiry if there were any (that had been) prisoners\r\nthere a feeble voice responded, from a little pile of straw and rags in\r\na corner, ‘Yes, Michael, there is one.’\r\n\r\n“Overcome by his feelings my father knelt by the side of the poor\r\nemaciated boy, and took him in his arms. He then bore him to a house\r\nwhere he could procure some comforts in the way of food and clothing.\r\nAfter this he got an armchair, two pillows, and some leather straps.\r\n\r\n“He placed his suffering and beloved charge in the chair, supported him\r\nby the pillows, swung him by the leather straps to his back, and carried\r\nhim some miles into the country, where he found a friendly asylum for\r\nhim in the house of some good Quakers. There he nursed him, and by the\r\naid of the kind owners, who were farmers, gave him nourishing food,\r\nuntil he partially recovered strength.\r\n\r\n“But your father was very impatient to get home, and wished to proceed\r\nbefore he was well able to walk, and did so leave, while my father\r\nwalked by his side, with his arm around him to support him. Thus they\r\ntravelled from the neighborhood of Philadelphia, to Shepherdstown\r\n(Virginia) of course by short stages, when my father restored him safe\r\nto his mother and family.\r\n\r\n“Your father related some of the incidents of that trip to me when I\r\nlast saw him at Bedford (his home) in the spring of 1817, not more\r\nthan one year before his death. Our uncle, Henry Bedinger, was also a\r\nprisoner for a long time, and although he suffered greatly his suffering\r\nwas not to be compared to your father’s.\r\n\r\n“After your father recovered his health he again entered the service\r\nand continued in it to the end of the war. He was made Lieutenant, and\r\nI have heard my father speak of many battles he was in, but I have\r\nforgotten the names and places.” [Footnote: Letter of Dr B. F. Bedinger\r\nto Mrs H. B. Lee, written in 1871.]\r\n\r\nAfter Daniel Bedinger returned home he had a relapse, and lay, for a\r\nlong time, at the point of death. He, however, recovered, and re-entered\r\nthe service, where the first duty assigned him was that of acting as one\r\nof the guards over the prisoners near Winchester. He afterwards fought\r\nwith Morgan in the southern campaigns, was in the battle of the Cowpens,\r\nand several other engagements, serving until the army was disbanded.\r\nHe was a Knight of the Order of the Cincinnati. His grandson, the Rev.\r\nHenry Bedinger, has the original parchment signed by General Washington,\r\nin his possession. This grandson is now the chaplain of the Virginia\r\nbranch of the Society.\r\n\r\nIn 1791 Daniel Bedinger married Miss Sarah Rutherford, a daughter of\r\nHon. Robert Rutherford, of Flowing Springs, in what is now Jefferson\r\nCounty, West Virginia, but was then part of Berkeley County, Virginia.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Bedinger lived in Norfolk for many years. He was first\r\nengaged in the Custom House in that city. In 1802 he accepted the\r\nposition of navy agent of the Gosport Navy Yard. He died in 1818 at his\r\nhome near Shepherdstown, of a malady which troubled him ever after\r\nhis confinement as a prisoner in New York. He hated the British with\r\na bitter hatred, which is not to be wondered at. He was an ardent\r\nsupporter of Thomas Jefferson, and wrote much for the periodicals of\r\nthe time. Withal he was a scholarly gentleman, and a warm and generous\r\nfriend. He built a beautiful residence on the site of his mother’s old\r\nhome near Sheperdstown; where, when he died in 1818, he left a large\r\nfamily of children, and a wide circle of friends and admirers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE NEWSPAPERS OF THE REVOLUTION\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat we have been able to glean from the periodicals of the day about\r\nthe state of the prisons in New York during the years 1776 and 1777 we\r\nwill condense into one short chapter.\r\n\r\nWe will also give an abstract taken from a note book written by General\r\nJeremiah Johnson, who as a boy, lived near Wallabout Bay during the\r\nRevolution and who thus describes one of the first prison ships used by\r\nthe British at New York. He says: “The subject of the naval prisoners,\r\nand of the British prisons-ships, stationed at the Wallabout during the\r\nRevolution, is one which cannot be passed by in silence. From printed\r\njournals, published in New York at the close of the war, it appeared\r\nthat 11,500 American prisoners had died on board the prison ships.\r\nAlthough this number is very great, yet if the numbers who perished had\r\nbeen less, the Commissary of Naval Prisoners, David Sproat, Esq., and\r\nhis Deputy, had it in their power, by an official Return, to give the\r\ntrue number taken, exchanged, escaped, and _dead_. Such a Return has\r\nnever appeared in the United States.\r\n\r\n“David Sproat returned to America after the war, and resided in\r\nPhiladelphia, where he died. [Footnote: This is, we believe, a mistake.\r\nAnother account says he died at Kirkcudbright, Scotland, in 1792.] The\r\nCommissary could not have been ignorant of the statement published here\r\non this interesting subject. We may, therefore, infer that about that\r\nnumber, 11,500, perished in the Prison ships.\r\n\r\n“A large transport called the Whitby, was the first prison ship anchored\r\nin the Wallabout. She was moored near Remsen’s Mill about the 20th of\r\nOctober, 1776, and was then crowded with prisoners. Many landsmen were\r\nprisoners on board this vessel: she was said to be the most sickly of\r\nall the prison ships. Bad provisions, bad water, and scanted rations\r\nwere dealt to the prisoners. No medical men attended the sick. Disease\r\nreigned unrelieved, and hundreds died from pestilence, or were starved\r\non board this floating Prison. I saw the sand beach, between a ravine in\r\nthe hill and Mr. Remsen’s dock, become filled with graves in the course\r\nof two months: and before the first of May, 1777, the ravine alluded to\r\nwas itself occupied in the same way.\r\n\r\n“In the month of May, 1777, two large ships were anchored in the\r\nWallabout, when the prisoners were transferred from the Whitby to them.\r\nThese vessels were also very sickly from the causes before stated.\r\nAlthough many prisoners were sent on board of them, and none exchanged,\r\ndeath made room for all.\r\n\r\n“On a Sunday afternoon about the middle of October, 1777, one of these\r\nprison ships was burnt. The prisoners, except a few, who, it was said,\r\nwere burnt in the vessel, were removed to the remaining ship. It was\r\nreported at the time, that the prisoners had fired their prison,\r\nwhich, if true, proves that they preferred death, even by fire, to\r\nthe lingering sufferings of pestilence and starvation. In the month of\r\nFebruary, 1778, the remaining prison ship was burnt, when the prisoners\r\nwere removed from her to the ships then wintering in the Wallabout.”\r\n\r\nOne of the first notices we have in the newspapers of the day of\r\nAmerican prisoners is to the following effect: “London, August 5th,\r\n1775. As every rebel, who is taken prisoner, has incurred the pain\r\nof death by the law martial, it is said that Government will charter\r\nseveral transports, after their arrival at Boston to carry the culprits\r\nto the East Indies for the Company’s service. As it is the intention of\r\nGovernment only to punish the ringleaders and commanders _capitally_,\r\nand to suffer the inferior Rebels to redeem their lives by entering into\r\nthe East India Company’s service. This translation will only render them\r\nmore useful subjects than in their native country.”\r\n\r\nThis notice, copied from London papers, appeared in Holt’s _New York\r\nJournal_, for October 19th, 1775. It proved to be no idle threat. How\r\nmany of our brave soldiers were sent to languish out their lives in the\r\nBritish possessions in India, and on the coast of Africa, we have no\r\nmeans of knowing. Few, indeed, ever saw their homes again, but we\r\nwill give, in a future chapter, the narrative of one who escaped from\r\ncaptivity worse than death on the island of Sumatra.\r\n\r\nAn account of the mobbing of William Cunningham and John Hill is given\r\nin both the Tory and Whig papers of the day. It occurred in March, 1775.\r\n“William Cunningham and John Hill were mobbed by 200 men in New York,\r\ndragged through the green, Cunningham was robbed of his watch and the\r\nclothes torn off his back, etc., for being a Tory, and having made\r\nhimself obnoxious to the Americans. He has often been heard blustering\r\nin behalf of the ministry, and his behavior has recommended him to\r\nthe favor of several men of eminence, both in the military and civil\r\ndepartments. He has often been seen, on a footing of familiarity, at\r\ntheir houses, and parading the streets on a horse belonging to one of\r\nthe gentlemen, etc., etc.”\r\n\r\nThe _Virginia Gazette_ in its issue for the first of July, 1775, says:\r\n“On June 6th, 1775, the prisoners taken at Lexington were exchanged.\r\nThe wounded privates were soon sent on board the Levity. * * * At about\r\nthree a signal was made by the Levity that they were ready to deliver up\r\nour prisoners, upon which General Putnam and Major Moncrief went to\r\nthe ferry, where they received nine prisoners. The regular officers\r\nexpressed themselves as highly pleased, those who had been prisoners\r\npolitely acknowledged the genteel kindness they had received from\r\ntheir captors; the privates, who were all wounded men, expressed in the\r\nstrongest terms their grateful sense of the tenderness which had been\r\nshown them in their miserable situation; some of them could do it only\r\nby their tears. It would have been to the honor of the British arms\r\nif the prisoners taken from us could with justice have made the same\r\nacknowledgement. It cannot be supposed that any officers of rank or\r\ncommon humanity were knowing to the repeated cruel insults that were\r\noffered them; but it may not be amiss to hint to the upstarts concerned,\r\ntwo truths of which they appear to be wholly ignorant, viz: That\r\ncompassion is as essential a part of the character of a truly brave man\r\nas daring, and that insult offered to the person completely in the power\r\nof the insulters smells as strong of cowardice as it does of cruelty.”\r\n [Footnote: The first American prisoners were taken on the 17th of June,\r\n1775. These were thrown indiscriminately into the jail at Boston without\r\nany consideration of their rank. General Washington wrote to General\r\nGage on this subject, to which the latter replied by asserting that\r\nthe prisoners had been treated with care and kindness, though\r\nindiscriminately, as he acknowledged no rank that was not derived from\r\nthe King. General Carleton during his command conducted towards the\r\nAmerican prisoners with a degree of humanity that reflected the\r\ngreatest honor on his character.” From Ramsay’s “History of the American\r\nRevolution”]\r\n\r\nAt the battle of the Great Bridge “the Virginia militia showed the\r\ngreatest humanity and tenderness to the wounded prisoners. Several\r\nof them ran through a hot fire to lift up and bring in some that were\r\nbleeding, and whom they feared would die if not speedily assisted by the\r\nsurgeon. The prisoners had been told by Lord Dunmore that the Americans\r\nwould scalp them, and they cried out, ‘For God’s sake do not murder us!’\r\nOne of them who was unable to walk calling out in this manner to one of\r\nour men, was answered by him: ‘Put your arm about my neck and I’ll show\r\nyou what I intend to do.’ Then taking him, with his arm over his\r\nneck, he walked slowly along, bearing him with great tenderness to the\r\nbreastwork.” _Pennsylvania Evening Post_, January 6th, 1776.\r\n\r\nThe Great Bridge was built over the southern branch of the Elizabeth\r\nRiver, twelve miles above Norfolk. Colonel William Woodford commanded\r\nthe Virginia militia on this occasion.\r\n\r\n“The scene closed with as much humanity as it had been conducted\r\nwith bravery. The work of death being over, every one’s attention was\r\ndirected to the succor of the unhappy sufferers, and it is an undoubted\r\nfact that Captain Leslie was so affected with the tenderness of our\r\ntroops towards those who were yet capable of assistance that he gave\r\nsigns from the fort of his thankfulness for it.” _Pennsylvania Evening\r\nPost_, Jan. 6th, 1776.\r\n\r\nThe first mention we can find of a British prison ship is in the _New\r\nYork Packet_ for the 11th of April, 1776: “Captain Hammond * * * Ordered\r\nCaptain Forrester, his prisoner, who was on board the Roebuck, up to the\r\nprison ship at Norfolk in a pilot boat.”\r\n\r\n_The Constitutional Gazette_ for the 19th of April, 1776, has this\r\nannouncement, and though it does not bear directly on the subject of\r\nprisoners, it describes a set of men who were most active in taking\r\nthem, and were considered by the Americans as more cruel and vindictive\r\nthan even the British themselves.\r\n\r\n“Government have sent over to Germany to engage 1,000 men called Jagers,\r\npeople brought up to the use of the rifle barrel guns in boar-hunting.\r\nThey are amazingly expert. Every petty prince who hath forests keeps a\r\nnumber of them, and they are allowed to take apprentices, by which means\r\nthey are a numerous body of people. These men are intended to act in the\r\nnext campaign in America, and our ministry plume themselves much in the\r\nthought of their being a complete match for the American riflemen.”\r\n\r\nFrom Gaine’s _Mercury_, a notorious Tory paper published in New York\r\nduring the British occupancy, we take the following: “November 25th,\r\n1776. There are now 5,000 prisoners in town, many of them half naked.\r\nCongress deserts the poor wretches,--have sent them neither provisions\r\nnor clothing, nor paid attention to their distress nor that of their\r\nfamilies. Their situation must have been doubly deplorable, but for\r\nthe humanity of the King’s officers. Every possible attention has been\r\ngiven, considering their great numbers and necessary confinement, to\r\nalleviate their distress arising from guilt, sickness, and poverty.”\r\n\r\nThis needs no comment. It is too unspeakably false to be worth\r\ncontradicting.\r\n\r\n“New London, Conn., November 8th, 1776. Yesterday arrived E. Thomas, who\r\nwas captured September 1st, carried to New York, and put on board the\r\nChatham. He escaped Wednesday sennight.”\r\n\r\n“New London, Nov. 20th, 1776. American officers, prisoners on parole,\r\nare walking about the streets of New York, but soldiers are closely\r\nconfined, have but half allowance, are sickly, and die fast.”\r\n\r\n“New London, Nov. 29th, 1776. A cartel arrived here for exchange of\r\nseamen only. Prisoners had miserable confinement on board of store ships\r\nand transports, where they suffered for want of the common necessaries\r\nof life.”\r\n\r\n“Exact from a letter written on board the Whitby Prison Ship. New York,\r\nDec. 9th, 1776. Our present situation is most wretched; more than 250\r\nprisoners, some sick and without the least assistance from physician,\r\ndrug, or medicine, and fed on two-thirds allowance of salt provisions,\r\nand crowded promiscuously together without regard, to color, person or\r\noffice, in the small room of a ship’s between decks, allowed to walk the\r\nmain deck only between sunrise and sunset. Only two at a time allowed to\r\ncome on deck to do what nature requires, and sometimes denied even that,\r\nand use tubs and buckets between decks, to the great offence of every\r\ndelicate, cleanly person, and prejudice of all our healths. Lord Howe\r\nhas liberated all in the merchant service, but refuses to exchange those\r\ntaken in arms but for like prisoners.” (This is an extract from the\r\nTrumbull Papers.)\r\n\r\nFrom a Connecticut paper: “This may inform those who have friends in New\r\nYork, prisoners of war, that Major Wells, a prisoner, has come thence to\r\nConnecticut on parole, to collect money for the much distressed officers\r\nand soldiers there, and desires the money may be left at Landlord Betts,\r\nNorwalk; Captain Benjamin’s, Stratford; Landlord Beers, New Haven;\r\nHezekiah Wylly’s, Hartford; and at said Well’s, Colchester, with proper\r\naccounts from whom received, and to whom to be delivered. N. B. The\r\nletters must not be sealed, or contain anything of a political nature.”\r\n Conn. Papers, Dec. 6th, 1776.\r\n\r\n“Conn. _Gazette_, Feb. 8th, 1777. William Gamble deposes that the\r\nprisoners were huddled together with negroes, had weak grog; no swab\r\nto clean the ship; bad oil; raw pork; seamen refused them water; called\r\nthem d----d rebels; the dead not buried, etc.”\r\n\r\n“Lieut. Wm. Sterrett, taken August 27, 1776, deposes that his clothing\r\nwas stolen, that he was abused by the soldiers; stinted in food; etc.,\r\nthose who had slight wounds were allowed to perish from neglect. The\r\nrecruiting officers seduced the prisoners to enlist, etc.”\r\n\r\n“March 7th, 1777. Forty-six prisoners from the Glasgow, transport ship,\r\nwere landed in New Haven, where one of them, Captain Craigie, died and\r\nwas buried.” (Their names are published in the Connecticut _Courant_.)\r\n\r\nConnecticut _Gazette_ of April 30th, 1777, says: “The Connecticut\r\nAssembly sent to New York a sufficient supply of tow shirts and trousers\r\nfor her prisoners, also £35 to Col. Ethan Allen, by his brother Levi.”\r\n\r\n“Lt. Thos. Fanning, now on parole from Long Island at Norwich, a\r\nprisoner to General Howe, will be at Hartford on his return to New\r\nYork about September 8th, whence he proposes to keep the public road to\r\nKing’s Bridge. Letters and money left at the most noted public houses\r\nin the different towns, will be conveyed safe to the prisoners.\r\nExtraordinaries excepted.” Connecticut _Gazette_, Aug. 15th, 1777.\r\n\r\n“Jan. 8th, ‘77. A flag of truce vessel arrived at Milford after\r\na tedious passage of eleven days, from New York, having above 200\r\nprisoners, whose rueful countenances too well discovered the ill\r\ntreatment they received in New York. Twenty died on the passage, and\r\ntwenty since they landed.” New Haven, Conn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE TRUMBULL PAPERS AND OTHER SOURCES OF INFORMATION\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will now quote from the Trumbull Papers and other productions, what\r\nis revealed to the public of the state of the prisoners in New York\r\nin 1776 and 1777. Some of our information we have obtained from a book\r\npublished in 1866 called “Documents and Letters Intended to Illustrate\r\nthe Revolutionary Incidents of Long Island, by Henry Onderdonk, Jr.” He\r\ngives an affecting account of the wounding of General Woodhull, after\r\nhis surrender, and when he had given up his sword. The British\r\nruffians who held him insisted that he should cry, “God save the King!”\r\n whereupon, taking off his hat, he replied, reverently, “God save all\r\nof us!” At this the cruel men ran him through, giving him wounds that\r\nproved mortal, though had they been properly dressed his life might have\r\nbeen spared. He was mounted behind a trooper and carried to Hinchman’s\r\nTavern, Jamaica, where permission was refused to Dr. Ogden to dress\r\nhis wounds. This was on the 28th of August, 1776. Next day he was taken\r\nwestward and put on board an old vessel off New Utrecht. This had been a\r\ncattle ship. He was next removed to the house of Wilhelmus Van Brunt at\r\nNew Utrecht. His arm mortified from neglect and it was decided to take\r\nit off. He sent express to his wife that he had no hope of recovery, and\r\nbegged her to gather up what provisions she could, for he had a large\r\nfarm, and hasten to his bedside. She accordingly loaded a wagon with\r\nbread, ham, crackers, butter, etc., and barely reached her husband\r\nin time to see him alive. With his dying breath he requested her to\r\ndistribute the provisions she had brought to the suffering and starving\r\nAmerican prisoners.\r\n\r\nElias Baylis, who was old and blind, was chairman of the Jamaica\r\nCommittee of Safety. He was captured and first imprisoned in the church\r\nat New Utrecht. Afterwards he was sent to the provost prison in New\r\nYork. He had a very sweet voice, and was an earnest Christian. In\r\nthe prison he used to console himself and his companions in misery by\r\nsinging hymns and psalms. Through the intervention of his friends, his\r\nrelease was obtained after two months confinement, but the rigor of\r\nprison life had been too much for his feeble frame. He died, in the arms\r\nof his daughter, as he was in a boat crossing the ferry to his home.\r\n\r\nWhile in the Presbyterian church in New Utrecht used as a prison by the\r\nBritish, he had for companions, Daniel Duryee, William Furman, William\r\nCreed, and two others, all put into one pew. Baylis asked them to get\r\nthe Bible out of the pulpit and read it to him. They feared to do this,\r\nbut consented to lead the blind man to the pulpit steps. As he returned\r\nwith the Bible in his hands a British guard met him, beat him violently\r\nand took away the book. They were three weeks in the church at New\r\nUtrecht. When a sufficient number of Whig prisoners were collected there\r\nthey would be marched under guard to a prison ship. One old Whig\r\nnamed Smith, while being conducted to his destination, appealed to an\r\nonlooker, a Tory of his acquaintance, to intercede for him. The cold\r\nreply of his neighbor was, “Ah, John, you’ve been a great rebel!” Smith\r\nturned to another of his acquaintances named McEvers, and said to him,\r\n“McEvers, its hard for an old man like me to have to go to a prison!\r\nCan’t you do something for me?”\r\n\r\n“What have you been doing, John?”\r\n\r\n“Why, I’ve had opinions of my own!”\r\n\r\n“Well, I’ll see what I can do for you.”\r\n\r\nMcEvers then went to see the officers in charge and made such\r\nrepresentations to them that Smith was immediately released.\r\n\r\nAdrian Onderdonk was taken to Flushing and shut up in the old Friends’\r\nMeeting House there, which is one of the oldest places of worship in\r\nAmerica. Next day he was taken to New York. He, with other prisoners,\r\nwas paraded through the streets to the provost, with a gang of loose\r\nwomen marching before them, to add insult to suffering.\r\n\r\nOnderdonk says: “After awhile the rigor of the prison rules was somewhat\r\nabated.” He was allowed to write home, which he did in Dutch, for\r\nprovisions, such as smoked beef, butter, etc. * * * His friends procured\r\na woman to do his washing, prepare food and bring it to him. * * *\r\nOne day as he was walking through the rooms followed by his constant\r\nattendant, a negro with coils of rope around his neck, this man asked\r\nOnderdonk what he was imprisoned for.\r\n\r\n“‘I’ve been a Committee man,’” said he.\r\n\r\n“‘Well,’ with an oath and a great deal of abuse, ‘You shall be hung\r\ntomorrow.’”\r\n\r\nThis mulatto was named Richmond, and was the common hangman. He used\r\nto parade the provost with coils of ropes, requesting the prisoners to\r\nchoose their own halters. He it was who hung the gallant Nathan Hale,\r\nand was Cunningham’s accessory in all his brutal midnight murders. In\r\nGaine’s paper for August 4th, 1781, appears the following advertisement:\r\n“One Guinea Reward, ran away a black man named Richmond, being the\r\ncommon hangman, formerly the property of the rebel Colonel Patterson of\r\nPa.\r\n\r\n“Wm. Cunningham.”\r\n\r\nAfter nearly four weeks imprisonment the friends of Adrian Onderdonk\r\nprocured his release. He was brought home in a wagon in the night, so\r\npale, thin, and feeble from bodily suffering that his family scarcely\r\nrecognized him. His constitution was shattered and he never recovered\r\nhis former strength.\r\n\r\nOnderdonk says that women often brought food for the prisoners in little\r\nbaskets, which, after examination, were handed in. Now and then the\r\nguard might intercept what was sent, or Cunningham, if the humor took\r\nhim, as he passed through the hall, might kick over vessels of soup,\r\nplaced there by the charitable for the poor and friendless prisoners.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACT FROM A BETTER FROM DR. SILAS HOLMES\r\n\r\n“The wounded prisoners taken at the battle of Brooklyn were put in the\r\nchurches of Flatbush and New Utrecht, but being neglected and unattended\r\nwere wallowing in their own filth, and breathed an infected and impure\r\nair. Ten days after the battle Dr. Richard Bailey was appointed to\r\nsuperintend the sick. He was humane, and dressed the wounded daily; got\r\na sack bed, sheet, and blanket for each prisoner; and distributed the\r\nprisoners into the adjacent barns. When Mrs. Woodhull offered to pay Dr.\r\nBailey for his care and attention to her husband, he said he had done no\r\nmore than his duty, and if there was anything due it was to me.”\r\n\r\nWoodhull’s wounds were neglected nine days before Dr. Bailey was allowed\r\nto attend them.\r\n\r\nHow long the churches were used as prisons cannot be ascertained, but\r\nwe have no account of prisoners confined in any of them after the year\r\n1777. In the North Dutch Church in New York there were, at one time,\r\neight hundred prisoners huddled together. It was in this church that\r\nbayonet marks were discernible on its pillars, many years after the war.\r\n\r\nThe provost and old City Hall were used as prisons until Evacuation Day,\r\nwhen O’Keefe threw his ponderous bunch of keys on the floor and retired.\r\nThe prisoners are said to have asked him where they were to go.\r\n\r\n“To hell, for what I care,” he replied.\r\n\r\n“In the Middle Dutch Church,” says Mr. John Pintard, who was a nephew\r\nof Commissary Pintard, “the prisoners taken on Long Island and at Fort\r\nWashington, sick, wounded, and well, were all indiscriminately huddled\r\ntogether, by hundreds and thousands, large numbers of whom died by\r\ndisease, and many undoubtedly poisoned by inhuman attendants for the\r\nsake of their watches, or silver buckles.”\r\n\r\n“What was called the Brick Church was at first used as a prison, but\r\nsoon it and the Presbyterian Church in Wall Street, the Scotch Church\r\nin Cedar Street, and the Friends’ Meeting House were converted into\r\nhospitals.”\r\n\r\nOliver Woodruff, who died at the age of ninety, was taken prisoner at\r\nFort Washington, and left the following record: “We were marched to New\r\nYork and went into different prisons. Eight hundred and sixteen went\r\ninto the New Bridewell (between the City Hall and Broadway); some into\r\nthe Sugar House; others into the Dutch Church. On Thursday morning they\r\nbrought us a little provision, which was the first morsel we got to eat\r\nor drink after eating our breakfast on Saturday morning. * * * I was\r\nthere (in New Bridewell) three months. In the dungeons of the old City\r\nHall which stood on the site of what was afterwards the Custom House at\r\nfirst civil offenders were confined, but afterwards whale-boatmen and\r\nrobbers.”\r\n\r\nRobert Troup, a young lieutenant in Colonel Lasher’s battalion,\r\ntestified that he and Lieut. Edward Dunscomb, Adjutant Hoogland, and\r\ntwo volunteers were made prisoners by a detachment of British troops at\r\nthree o’clock a m. on the 27th of August, 1776. They were carried before\r\nthe generals and interrogated, with threats of hanging. Thence they were\r\nled to a house near Flatbush. At 9 a. m. they were led, in the rear\r\nof the army, to Bedford. Eighteen officers captured that morning were\r\nconfined in a small soldier’s tent for two nights and nearly three days.\r\nIt was raining nearly all the time. Sixty privates, also, had but one\r\ntent, while at Bedford the provost marshal, Cunningham, brought with him\r\na negro with a halter, telling them the negro had already hung several,\r\nand he imagined he would hang some more. The negro and Cunningham also\r\nheaped abuse upon the prisoners, showing them the halter, and calling\r\nthem rebels, scoundrels, robbers, murderers, etc.\r\n\r\nFrom Bedford they were led to Flatbush, and confined a week in a house\r\nbelonging to a Mr. Leffert, on short allowance of biscuit and salt pork.\r\nSeveral Hessians took pity on them and gave them apples, and once some\r\nfresh beef.\r\n\r\nFrom Flatbush after a week, he, with seventy or eighty other officers,\r\nwere put on board a snow, lying between Gravesend and the Hook, without\r\nbedding or blankets; afflicted with vermin; soap and fresh water for\r\nwashing purposes being denied them. They drank and cooked with filthy\r\nwater brought from England. The captain charged a very large commission\r\nfor purchasing necessaries for them with the money they procured from\r\ntheir friends.\r\n\r\nAfter six weeks spent on the snow they were taken on the 17th of October\r\nto New York and confined in a house near Bridewell. At first they were\r\nnot allowed any fuel, and afterwards only a little coal for three days\r\nin the week. Provisions were dealt out very negligently, were scanty,\r\nand of bad quality. Many were ill and most of them would have died had\r\ntheir wants not been supplied by poor people and loose women of the\r\ntown, who took pity on them.\r\n\r\n“Shortly after the capture of Fort Washington these officers were\r\nparoled and allowed the freedom of the town. Nearly half the prisoners\r\ntaken on Long Island died. The privates were treated with great\r\ninhumanity, without fuel, or the common necessaries of life, and were\r\nobliged to obey the calls of nature in places of their confinement.”\r\n It is said that the British did not hang any of the prisoners taken in\r\nAugust on Long Island, but “played the fool by making them ride with a\r\nrope around their necks, seated on coffins, to the gallows. Major Otho\r\nWilliams was so treated.”\r\n\r\n“Adolph Myer, late of Colonel Lasher’s battalion, says he was taken by\r\nthe British at Montresor’s Island. They threatened twice to hang him,\r\nand had a rope fixed to a tree. He was led to General Howe’s quarters\r\nnear Turtle Bay, who ordered him to be bound hand and foot. He was\r\nconfined four days on bread and water, in the ‘condemned hole’ of the\r\nNew Jail, without straw or bedding. He was next put into the\r\nCollege, and then into the New Dutch Church, whence he escaped on the\r\ntwenty-fourth of January, 1777. He was treated with great inhumanity,\r\nand would have died had he not been supported by his friends. * * * Many\r\nprisoners died from want, and others were reduced to such wretchedness\r\nas to attract the attention of the loose women of the town, from whom\r\nthey received considerable assistance. No care was taken of the sick,\r\nand if any died they were thrown at the door of the prison and lay there\r\nuntil the next day, when they were put in a cart and drawn out to the\r\nintrenchments beyond the Jews’ burial ground, when they were interred\r\nby their fellow prisoners, conducted thither for that purpose. The\r\ndead were thrown into a hole promiscuously, without the usual rites of\r\nsepulchre. Myer was frequently enticed to enlist.” This is one of the\r\nfew accounts we have from a prisoner who was confined in one of the\r\nchurches in New York, and he was so fortunate as to escape before it\r\nwas too late. We wish he had given the details of his escape. In such a\r\ngloomy picture as we are obliged to present to our readers the only high\r\nlights are occasional acts of humanity, and such incidents as fortunate\r\nescapes.\r\n\r\nIt would appear, from many proofs, that the Hessian soldier was\r\nnaturally a good-natured being, and he seems to have been the most\r\nhumane of the prison guards. We will see, as we go on, instances of the\r\nkindness of these poor exiled mercenaries, to many of whom the war\r\nwas almost as great a scene of calamity and suffering as it was to the\r\nwretched prisoners under their care.\r\n\r\n“Lieutenant Catlin, taken September 15th, ‘76, was confined in prison\r\nwith no sustenance for forty-eight hours; for eleven days he had only\r\ntwo days allowance of pork offensive to the smell, bread hard, mouldy\r\nand wormy, made of canail and dregs of flax-seed; water brackish. ‘I\r\nhave seen $1.50 given for a common pail full. Three or four pounds of\r\npoor Irish pork were given to three men for three days. In one church\r\nwere 850 prisoners for near three months.’”\r\n\r\n“About the 25th of December he with 225 men were put on board the\r\nGlasgow at New York to be carried to Connecticut for exchange. They were\r\naboard eleven days, and kept on coarse broken bread, and less pork than\r\nbefore, and had no fire for sick or well; crowded between decks, where\r\ntwenty-eight died through ill-usage and cold.” (This is taken from the\r\n“History of Litchfield,” page 39.)\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER DATED NEW YORK, DEC. 26, 1776\r\n\r\n“The distress of the prisoners cannot be communicated in words. Twenty\r\nor thirty die every day; they lie in heaps unburied; what numbers of my\r\ncountrymen have died by cold and hunger, perished for want of the common\r\nnecessaries of life! I have seen it! This, sir, is the boasted British\r\nclemency! I myself had well nigh perished under it. The New England\r\npeople can have no idea of such barbarous policy. Nothing can stop such\r\ntreatment but retaliation. I ever despised private revenge, but that of\r\nthe public must be in this case, both just and necessary; it is due to\r\nthe manes of our murdered countrymen, and that alone can protect the\r\nsurvivors in the like situation. Rather than experience again their\r\nbarbarity and insults, may I fall by the sword of the Hessians.”\r\n\r\nOnderdonk, who quotes this fragment, gives us no clue to the writer. A\r\nman named S. Young testifies that, “he was taken at Fort Washington\r\nand, with 500 prisoners, was kept in a barn, and had no provisions\r\nuntil Monday night, when the enemy threw into the stable, in a confused\r\nmanner, as if to so many hogs, a quantity of biscuits in crumbs, mostly\r\nmouldy, and some crawling with maggots, which the prisoners were obliged\r\nto scramble for without any division. Next day they had a little pork\r\nwhich they were obliged to eat raw. Afterwards they got sometimes a bit\r\nof pork, at other times biscuits, peas, and rice. They were confined\r\ntwo weeks in a church, where they suffered greatly from cold, not being\r\nallowed any fire. Insulted by soldiers, women, and even negroes. Great\r\nnumbers died, three, four, or more, sometimes, a day. Afterwards they\r\nwere carried on board a ship, where 500 were confined below decks.”\r\n\r\nThe date of this testimony is given as Dec. 15th, 1776: “W. D. says the\r\nprisoners were roughly used at Harlem on their way from Fort Washington\r\nto New York, where 800 men were stored in the New Bridewell, which was a\r\ncold, open house, the windows not glazed. They had not one mouthful from\r\nearly Saturday morning until Monday. Rations per man for three days were\r\nhalf a pound of biscuit, half a pound of pork, half a gill of rice, half\r\na pint of peas, and half an ounce of butter, the whole not enough for\r\none good meal, and they were defrauded in this petty allowance. They had\r\nno straw to lie on, no fuel but one cart load per week for 800 men. At\r\nnine o’clock the Hessian guards would come and put out the fire, and lay\r\non the poor prisoners with heavy clubs, for sitting around the fire.\r\n\r\n“The water was very bad, as well as the bread. Prisoners died like\r\nrotten sheep, with cold, hunger, and dirt; and those who had good\r\napparel, such as buckskin breeches, or good coats, were necessitated to\r\nsell them to purchase bread to keep them alive.” Hinman, page 277.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. White left New York Jan. 20th, 1777. She says Bridewell, the\r\nCollege, the New Jail, the Baptist Meeting House, and the tavern lately\r\noccupied by Mr. De la Montaigne and several other houses are filled with\r\nsick and wounded of the enemy. General Lee was under guard in a small\r\nmean house at the foot of King Street. Wm. Slade says 800 prisoners\r\ntaken at Fort Washington were put into the North church. On the first\r\nof December 300 were taken from the church to the prison ship. December\r\nsecond he, with others, was marched to the Grosvenor transport in the\r\nNorth River; five hundred were crowded on board. He had to lie down\r\nbefore sunset to secure a place.” Trumbull Papers.\r\n\r\n“Henry Franklin affirms that about two days after the taking of Fort\r\nWashington he was in New York, and went to the North Church, in which\r\nwere about 800 prisoners taken in said Fort. He inquired into their\r\ntreatment, and they told him they fared hard on account both of\r\nprovisions and lodging, for they were not allowed any bedding, or\r\nblankets, and the provisions had not been regularly dealt out, so that\r\nthe modest or backward could get little or none, nor had they been\r\nallowed any fuel to dress their victuals. The prisoners in New York were\r\nvery sickly, and died in considerable numbers.”\r\n\r\n“Feb. 11, 1777. Joshua Loring, Commissary of Prisoners, says that but\r\nlittle provisions had been sent in by the rebels for their prisoners.”\r\n Gaine’s Mercury.\r\n\r\n_Jan. 4th_. 1777. “Seventy-seven prisoners went into the Sugar House. N.\r\nMurray says 800 men were in Bridewell. The doctor gave poison powders to\r\nthe prisoners, who soon died. Some were sent to Honduras to cut logwood;\r\nwomen came to the prison-gate to sell gingerbread.” Trumbull Papers.\r\n\r\nThe _New York Gazette_ of May 6th, 1777, states that “of 3000 prisoners\r\ntaken at Fort Washington, only 800 are living.”\r\n\r\nMr. Onderdonk says: “There seems to have been no systematic plan adopted\r\nby the citizens of New York for the relief of the starving prisoners.\r\nWe have scattering notices of a few charitable individuals, such as the\r\nfollowing:--‘Mrs. Deborah Franklin was banished from New York Nov. 21st,\r\n1780, by the British commandant, for her unbounded liberality to the\r\nAmerican prisoners. Mrs. Ann Mott was associated with Mrs. Todd and Mrs.\r\nWhitten in relieving the sufferings of American prisoners in New York,\r\nduring the Revolution. John Fillis died at Halifax, 1792, aged 68. He\r\nwas kind to American prisoners in New York. Jacob Watson, Penelope Hull,\r\netc., are also mentioned.’”\r\n\r\n\r\nBRITISH ACCOUNT OF MORTALITY OF PRISONERS\r\n\r\n“P. Dobbyn, master of a transport, thus writes from New York, Jan. 15th,\r\n1777. ‘We had four or five hundred prisoners on board our ships, but\r\nthey had such bad distempers that each ship buried ten or twelve a day.’\r\nAnother writer, under date of Jan. 14th, ‘77, says, ‘The Churches are\r\nfull of American prisoners, who die so fast that 25 or 30 are buried\r\nat a time, in New York City. General Howe gave all who could walk\r\ntheir liberty, after taking their oath not to take up arms against his\r\nMajesty.’” (From a London Journal.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nA JOURNAL KEPT IN THE PROVOST\r\n\r\n\r\nAn old man named John Fell was taken up by the British, and confined\r\nfor some months in the Provost prison.

We have already seen how Mr Elias Boudinot, American\r\nCommissary of Prisoners, came to that place of confinement, and what\r\nhe found there. This was in February, 1778. Boudinot also describes\r\nthe sufferings of the American prisoners in the early part of 1778 in\r\nPhiladelphia, and Mr. Fell speaks of Cunningham’s return to New York.\r\nHe had, it appears, been occupied in starving prisoners in Philadelphia\r\nduring his absence from the Provost, to which General Howe sent him\r\nback, after he had murdered one of his victims in Philadelphia with the\r\ngreat key.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the prisoners in the Provost sent an account of their\r\ntreatment to General Jones, by Mr. Pintard, in September, 1777, several\r\nmonths before the visit of Mr. Elias Boudinot. They complained that\r\nthey were closely confined in the jail without distinction of rank\r\nor character, amongst felons, a number of whom were under sentence\r\nof death: that their friends were not allowed to speak to them, even\r\nthrough the grates: that they were put on the scanty allowance of two\r\npounds hard biscuit, and two pounds of raw pork per week, without fuel\r\nto dress it. That they were frequently supplied with water from a pump\r\nwhere all kinds of filth was thrown, by which it was rendered obnoxious\r\nand unwholesome, the effects of which were to cause much sickness. That\r\ngood water could have been as easily obtained. That they were denied the\r\nbenefit of a hospital; not permitted to send for medicine, nor to have\r\nthe services of a doctor, even when in the greatest distress. That\r\nmarried men and others who lay at the point of death were refused\r\npermission to have their wives or other relations admitted to see them.\r\nAnd that these poor women, for attempting to gain admittance, were often\r\nbeaten from the prison door. That commissioned officers, and others,\r\npersons of character and reputation, were frequently, without a cause,\r\nthrown into a loathsome dungeon, insulted in a gross manner, and vilely\r\nabused by a Provost Marshal, who was allowed to be one of the basest\r\ncharacters in the British Army, and whose power was so unlimited, that\r\nhe had caned an officer, on a trivial occasion; and frequently beaten\r\nthe sick privates when unable to stand, “many of whom are daily\r\nobliged to enlist in the New Corps to prevent perishing for want of the\r\nnecessaries of life.\r\n\r\n“Neither pen, ink, or paper allowed (to prevent their treatment being\r\nmade public) the consequence of which indeed, the prisoners themselves\r\ndread, knowing the malignant disposition of their keeper.”\r\n\r\nThe Board of War reported on the 21 of January, 1778, that there were\r\n900 privates and 300 officers in New York, prisoners, and that “the\r\nprivates have been crowded all summer in sugar houses, and the officers\r\nboarded on Long Island, except about thirty, who have been confined in\r\nthe Provost-Guard, and in most loathsome jails, and that since Oct. 1st,\r\nall those prisoners, both officers and privates, have been confined\r\nin prisons, prison ships, or the Provost.” Lists of prisoners in the\r\nProvost; those taken by the Falcon, Dec. 1777, and those belonging to\r\nConnecticut who were in the Quaker and Brick Meeting House hospitals in\r\nJan. 1778, may be found in the Trumbull Papers, VII, 62.\r\n\r\nIt seems that General Lee, while a prisoner in New York, in 1778, drew\r\na prize of $500 in the New York Lottery, and immediately distributed\r\nit among the prisoners in that city. A New London, Connecticut,\r\npaper, dated Feb. 20, 1778, states that “it is said that the American\r\nprisoners, since we have had a Commissary in New York, are well served\r\nwith good provisions, which are furnished at the expense of the States,\r\nand they are in general very healthy.”\r\n\r\nWe fear this was a rose-colored view of the matter, though there is\r\nno doubt that our commissaries did what they could to alleviate the\r\nmiseries of captivity.\r\n\r\nOnderdonk quotes from Gaine’s _Mercury_ an advertisement for nurses in\r\nthe hospital, but it is undated. “Nurses wanted immediately to attend\r\nthe prison hospitals in this city. Good recommendations required, signed\r\nby two respectable inhabitants. Lewis Pintard.”\r\n\r\nFrom the New York _Gazette_, May 6, 1778, we take the following:\r\n“Colonel Miles, Irvin, and fifty more exchanged.”\r\n\r\n“Conn. _Gazette_. July 10, ‘78. About three weeks ago Robert Shefield,\r\nof Stonington, made his escape from New York after confinement in a\r\nprison ship. After he was taken he, with his crew of ten, were thrust\r\ninto the fore-peak, and put in irons. On their arrival at New York they\r\nwere carried on board a prison ship, and to the hatchways, on opening\r\nwhich, tell not of Pandora’s box, for that must be an alabaster box in\r\ncomparison to the opening of these hatches. True there were gratings (to\r\nlet in air) but they kept their boats upon them. The steam of the hold\r\nwas enough to scald the skin, and take away the breath, the stench\r\nenough to poison the air all around.\r\n\r\n“On his descending these dreary mansions of woe, and beholding the\r\nnumerous spectacles of wretchedness and despair, his soul fainted within\r\nhim. A little epitome of hell,--about 300 men confined between decks,\r\nhalf Frenchmen. He was informed there were three more of these vehicles\r\nof contagion, which contained a like number of miserable Frenchmen also,\r\nwho were treated worse, if possible, than Americans.\r\n\r\n“The heat was so intense that (the hot sun shining all day on deck) they\r\nwere all naked, which also served the well to get rid of vermin, but the\r\nsick were eaten up alive. Their sickly countenances, and ghastly looks\r\nwere truly horrible; some swearing and blaspheming; others crying,\r\npraying, and wringing their hands; and stalking about like ghosts;\r\nothers delirious, raving and storming,--all panting for breath; some\r\ndead, and corrupting. The air was so foul that at times a lamp could\r\nnot be kept burning, by reason of which the bodies were not missed until\r\nthey had been dead ten days.\r\n\r\n“One person alone was admitted on deck at a time, after sunset, which\r\noccasioned much filth to run into the hold, and mingle with the bilge\r\nwater, which was not pumped out while he was aboard, notwithstanding the\r\ndecks were leaky, and the prisoners begged permission to let in water\r\nand pump it out again.\r\n\r\n“While Mr. Sheffield was on board, which was six days, five or six died\r\ndaily, and three of his people. He was sent for on shore as evidence in\r\na Court of Admiralty for condemning his own vessel, and happily escaped.\r\n\r\n“He was informed in New York that the fresh meat sent in to our\r\nprisoners by our Commissary was taken by the men-of-war for their own\r\nuse. This he can say: he did not see any aboard the ship he was in, but\r\nthey were well supplied with soft bread from our Commissaries on shore.\r\nBut the provision (be it what it will) is not the complaint. Fresh air\r\nand fresh water, God’s free gift, is all their cry.”\r\n\r\n“New London, Conn. July 31. 78. Last week 500 or 600 prisoners were\r\nreleased from confinement at New York and sent out chiefly by way of New\r\nJersey, being exchanged.”\r\n\r\n“New London Conn. Sep. 26, 78. All American prisoners are nearly sent\r\nout of New York, but there are 615 French prisoners still there.”\r\n\r\n“Oct 18, 78. The Ship, Good Hope, lies in the North River.”\r\n\r\n“New London Dec. 18, 78. A Flag with 70 men from the horrible prison\r\nships of New York arrived: 30 very sickly, 2 died since they arrived.”\r\n\r\n“N. London. Dec. 25, 78. A cartel arived here from New York with 172\r\nAmerican prisoners. They were landed here and in Groton, the greater\r\npart are sickly and in most deplorable condition, owing chiefly to the\r\nill usage in the prison ships, where numbers had their feet and legs\r\nfrozen”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE OLD SUGAR HOUSE--TRINTY CHURCHYARD\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will now take our readers with us to the Sugar House on Liberty\r\nStreet, long called the Old Sugar House, and the only one of the three\r\nSugar Houses which appear to have been used as a place of confinement\r\nfor American prisoners of war after the year 1777.\r\n\r\nWe have already mentioned this dreary abode of wretchedness, but it\r\ndeserves a more elaborate description.\r\n\r\nFrom Valentine’s Manual of the Common Council of New York for 1844 we\r\nwill copy the following brief sketch of the British Prisons in New York\r\nduring the Revolution.\r\n\r\n“The British took possession of New York Sep. 15, ‘76, and the capture\r\nof Ft. Washington, Nov. 16, threw 2700 prisoners into their power.\r\nTo these must be added 1000 taken at the battle of Brooklyn, and such\r\nprivate citizens as were arrested for their political principles, in\r\nNew York City and on Long Island, and we may safely conclude that Sir\r\nWilliam Howe had at least 5000 prisoners to provide for.\r\n\r\n“The sudden influx of so many prisoners; the recent capture of the city,\r\nand the unlooked-for conflagration of a fourth part of it, threw his\r\naffairs into such confusion that, from these circumstances alone, the\r\nprisoners must have suffered much, from want of food and other bodily\r\ncomforts, but there was superadded the studied cruelty of Captain\r\nCunningham, the Provost Marshal, and his deputies, and the criminal\r\nnegligence of Sir Wm. Howe.\r\n\r\n“To contain such a vast number of prisoners the ordinary places of\r\nconfinement were insufficient. Accordingly the Brick Church, the Middle\r\nChurch, the North Church, and the French Church were appropriated to\r\ntheir use. Beside these, Columbia College, the Sugar House, the New\r\nGaol, the new Bridewell, and the old City Hall were filled to their\r\nutmost capacity.\r\n\r\n“Till within a few years there stood on Liberty Street, south of the\r\nMiddle Dutch Church, a dark, stone building, with small, deep porthole\r\nlooking windows, rising tier above tier; exhibiting a dungeon-like\r\naspect. It was five stories high, and each story was divided into two\r\ndreary apartments.\r\n\r\n“On the stones and bricks in the wall were to be seen names and dates,\r\nas if done with a prisoner’s penknife, or nail. There was a strong,\r\ngaol-like door opening on Liberty St., and another on the southeast,\r\ndescending into a dismal cellar, also used as a prison. There was a walk\r\nnearly broad enough for a cart to travel around it, where night and day,\r\ntwo British or Hessian guards walked their weary rounds. The yard was\r\nsurrounded by a close board fence, nine feet high. ‘In the suffocating\r\nheat of summer,’ says Wm. Dunlap, ‘I saw every narrow aperture of these\r\nstone walls filled with human heads, face above face, seeking a portion\r\nof the external air.’\r\n\r\n“While the gaol fever was raging in the summer of 1777, the prisoners\r\nwere let out in companies of twenty, for half an hour at a time, to\r\nbreathe fresh air, and inside they were so crowded, that they divided\r\ntheir numbers into squads of six each. No. 1 stood for ten minutes as\r\nclose to the windows as they could, and then No. 2 took their places,\r\nand so on.\r\n\r\n“Seats there were none, and their beds were but straw, intermixed with\r\nvermin.\r\n\r\n“For many days the dead-cart visited the prison every morning, into\r\nwhich eight or ten corpses were flung or piled up, like sticks of wood,\r\nand dumped into ditches in the outskirts of the city.”\r\n\r\nSilas Talbot says: “A New York gentleman keeps a window shutter that was\r\nused as a checkerboard in the Sugar House. The prisoners daily unhinged\r\nit, and played on it.”\r\n\r\nMany years ago a small pamphlet was printed in New York to prove that\r\nsome of the American prisoners who died in the Old Sugar House were\r\nburied in Trinity church-yard. Andrew S. Norwood, who was a boy during\r\nthe Revolution, deposed that he used to carry food to John Van Dyke, in\r\nthis prison. The other prisoners would try to wrest away the food, as\r\nthey were driven mad by hunger. They were frequently fed with bread made\r\nfrom old, worm-eaten ship biscuits, reground into meal and offensive\r\nto the smell. Many of the prisoners died, and some were put into oblong\r\nboxes, sometimes two in a box, and buried in Trinity church-yard, and\r\nthe boy, himself, witnessed some of the interments. A part of Trinity\r\nchurch-yard was used as a common burying-ground,--as was also the yard\r\nof St. George’s Church, and what was called the Swamp Burying-Ground.\r\n\r\nThis boy also deposed that his uncle Clifford was murdered during the\r\nRevolution, it was supposed by foreign soldiers, and he was buried in\r\nTrinity church-yard.\r\n\r\nJacob Freeman, also a boy during the Revolution, deposed that his father\r\nand several other inhabitants of Woodbridge were arrested and sent to\r\nNew York. His grandfather was sixty years old, and when he was arrested,\r\nhis son, who was concealed and could have escaped, came out of his\r\nhiding-place and surrendered himself for the purpose of accompanying his\r\nfather to prison. The son was a Lieutenant. They were confined in the\r\nSugar House several months. Every day some of the prisoners died and\r\nwere buried in Old Trinity church-yard. Ensign Jacob Barnitz was wounded\r\nin both legs at the battle of Fort Washington. He was conveyed to New\r\nYork and there thrown into the Sugar House, and suffered to lie on\r\nthe damp ground. A kind friend had him conveyed to more comfortable\r\nquarters. Barnitz came from York, or Lancaster, Pa.\r\n\r\nLittle John Pennell was a cabin boy, bound to Captain White of the sloop\r\nof war, Nancy, in 1776. He testified that the prisoners of the Sugar\r\nHouse, which was very damp, were buried on the hill called “The Holy\r\nGround.” “I saw where they were buried. The graves were long and six\r\nfeet wide. Five or six were buried in one grave.” It was Trinity Church\r\nground.\r\n\r\nWe will now give an account of Levi Hanford, who was imprisoned in the\r\nSugar House in 1777. Levi Hanford was a son of Levi Hanford, and was\r\nborn in Connecticut, in the town of Norwalk, on the 19th of Feb., 1759.\r\nIn 1775 he enlisted in a militia company. In 1776 he was in service in\r\nNew York. In March 1777, being then a member of a company commanded by\r\nCaptain Seth Seymour, he was captured with twelve others under Lieut. J.\r\nB. Eels, at the “Old Well” in South Norwalk, Conn. While a prisoner in\r\nthe Old Sugar House he sent the following letter to his father. A friend\r\nwrote the first part for him, and he appears to have finished it in his\r\nown handwriting.\r\n\r\nNew York June 7. 1777\r\n\r\nLoving Father:--\r\n\r\nI take the opportunity to let you know I am alive, and in reasonable\r\nhealth, since I had the small-pox.--thanks be to the Lord for it. * * *\r\nI received the things you sent me. * * * I wish you would go and see if\r\nyou can’t get us exchanged--if you please. Matthias Comstock is dead.\r\nSam. Hasted, Ebenezer Hoyt, Jonathan Kellog has gone to the hospital to\r\nbe inoculated today. We want money very much. I have been sick but hope\r\nI am better. There is a doctor here that has helpt me. * * * I would not\r\ngo to the Hospital, for all manner of disease prevail there. * * * If\r\nyou can possibly help us send to the Governor and try to help us. * * *\r\nRemember my kind love to all my friends. I am\r\n\r\nYour Obedient son, Levi Hanford.\r\n\r\nPoor Levi Hanford was sent to the prison ship, Good Intent, and was not\r\nexchanged until the 8th of May, 1778.\r\n\r\nIn the “Journal of American History,” the third number of the second\r\nvolume, on page 527, are the recollections of Thomas Stone, a soldier\r\nof the Revolution, who was born in Guilford, Conn., in 1755. In April,\r\n1777, he enlisted under Capt. James Watson in Colonel Samuel Webb’s\r\nRegiment, Connecticut line. He spent the following campaign near the\r\nHudson. The 9th of December following Stone and his comrades under Gen.\r\nParsons, embarked on board some small vessel at Norwalk, Conn, with a\r\nview to take a small fort on Long Island. “We left the shore,” he says,\r\n“about six o’clock, P. M. The night was very dark, the sloop which I was\r\naboard of parted from the other vessels, and at daybreak found\r\nourselves alongside a British frigate. Our sloop grounded, we struck\r\nour colors-fatal hour! We were conducted to New York, introduced to the\r\nJersey Prison Ship. We were all destitute of any clothing except what we\r\nhad on; we now began to taste the vials of Monarchial tender mercy.\r\n\r\n“About the 25th of Jan. 1778, we were taken from the ships to the Sugar\r\nHouse, which during the inclement season was more intolerable than the\r\nShips.\r\n\r\n“We left the floating Hell with joy, but alas, our joy was of short\r\nduration. Cold and famine were now our destiny. Not a pane of glass, nor\r\neven a board to a single window in the house, and no fire but once in\r\nthree days to cook our small allowance of provision. There was a scene\r\nthat truly tried body and soul. Old shoes were bought and eaten with as\r\nmuch relish as a pig or a turkey; a beef bone of four or five ounces,\r\nafter it was picked clean, was sold by the British guard for as many\r\ncoppers.\r\n\r\n“In the spring our misery increased; frozen feet began to mortify; by\r\nthe first of April, death took from our numbers, and, I hope, from\r\ntheir misery, from seven to ten a day; and by the first of May out of\r\nsixty-nine taken with me only fifteen were alive, and eight out of that\r\nnumber unable to work.\r\n\r\n“Death stared the living in the face: we were now attacked by a fever\r\nwhich threatened to clear our walls of its miserable inhabitants.\r\n\r\n“About the 20th of July I made my escape from the prison-yard. Just\r\nbefore the lamps were lighted. I got safely out of the city, passed all\r\nthe guards, was often fired at, but still safe as to any injury done me;\r\narrived at Harlem River eastward of King’s Bridge.\r\n\r\n“Hope and fear were now in full exercise. The alarm was struck by the\r\nsentinels keeping firing at me. I arrived at the banks of Harlem,--five\r\nmen met me with their bayonets at my heart; to resist was instant death,\r\nand to give up, little better.\r\n\r\n“I was conducted to the main guard, kept there until morning then\r\nstarted for New York with waiters with bayonets at my back, arrived at\r\nmy old habitation about 1 o’clock, P. M.; was introduced to the Prison\r\nkeeper who threatened me with instant death, gave me two heavy blows\r\nwith his cane; I caught his arm and the guard interfered. Was driven to\r\nthe provost, thrust into a dungeon, a stone floor, not a blanket, not\r\na board, not a straw to rest on. Next day was visited by a Refugee\r\nLieutenant, offered to enlist me, offered a bounty, I declined. Next\r\nday renewed the visit, made further offers, told me the General was\r\ndetermined I should starve to death where I was unless I would enter\r\ntheir service. I told him his General dare not do it. (I shall here omit\r\nthe imprecations I gave him in charge.)\r\n\r\n“The third day I was visited by two British officers, offered me a\r\nsergeant’s post, threatened me with death as before, in case I refused.\r\nI replied, ‘Death if they dare!’\r\n\r\n“In about ten minutes the door was opened, a guard took me to my old\r\nhabitation the Sugar House, it being about the same time of day I left\r\nmy cell that I entered it, being three days and nights without a morsel\r\nof food or a drop of water,--all this for the crime of getting out of\r\nprison. When in the dungeon reflecting upon my situation I thought if\r\never mortal could be justified in praying for the destruction of his\r\nenemies, I am the man.\r\n\r\n“After my escape the guard was augmented, and about this time a new\r\nprison keeper was appointed, our situation became more tolerable.\r\n\r\n“The 16th of July was exchanged. Language would fail me to describe the\r\njoy of that hour; but it was transitory. On the morning of the 16th,\r\nsome friends, or what is still more odious, some Refugees, cast into\r\nthe Prison yard a quantity of warm bread, and it was devoured with\r\ngreediness. The prison gate was opened, we marched out about the number\r\nof 250. Those belonging to the North and Eastern States were conducted\r\nto the North River and driven on board the flag ship, and landed at\r\nElizabethtown, New Jersey. Those who ate of the bread soon sickened;\r\nthere was death in the bread they had eaten. Some began to complain\r\nin about half an hour after eating the bread, one was taken sick after\r\nanother in quick succession and the cry was, ‘Poison, poison!’ I was\r\ntaken sick about an hour after eating. When we landed, some could walk,\r\nand some could not. I walked to town about two miles, being led most\r\nof the way by two men. About one half of our number did not eat of the\r\nbread, as a report had been brought into the prison _that the prisoners\r\ntaken at Fort Washington had been poisoned in the same way_.\r\n\r\n“The sick were conveyed in wagons to White Plains, where I expected\r\nto meet my regiment, but they had been on the march to Rhode Island\r\nI believe, about a week. I was now in a real dilemma; I had not the\r\nvestige of a shirt to my body, was moneyless and friendless. What to\r\ndo I knew not. Unable to walk, a gentleman, I think his name was Allen,\r\noffered to carry me to New Haven, which he did. The next day I was\r\nconveyed to Guilford, the place of my birth, but no near relative to\r\nhelp me. Here I learned that my father had died in the service the\r\nSpring before. I was taken in by a hospitable uncle, but in moderate\r\ncircumstances. Dr. Readfield attended me for about four months I was\r\nsalivated twice, but it had no good effect. They sent me 30 miles to\r\nDr Little of East Haddam, who under kind Providence restored me to such\r\nstate of health that I joined my Regiment in the Spring following.\r\n\r\n“In the year 1780, I think in the month of June, General Green met the\r\nenemy at Springfield, New Jersey, and in the engagement I had my left\r\nelbow dislocated in the afternoon. The British fired the village and\r\nretreated. We pursued until dark. The next morning my arm was so swollen\r\nthat it _could_ not, or at least was not put right, and it has been ever\r\nsince a weak, feeble joint, which has disabled me from most kinds of\r\nmanual labor.”\r\n\r\nTo this account the grandson of Thomas Stone, the Rev. Hiram Stone, adds\r\nsome notes, in one of which he says, speaking of the Sugar House: “I\r\nhave repeatedly heard my grandfather relate that there were no windows\r\nleft in the building, and that during the winter season the snow would\r\nbe driven entirely across the great rooms in the different stories,\r\nand in the morning lie in drifts upon our poor, hungry, unprotected\r\nprisoners. Of a morning several frozen corpses would be dragged out,\r\nthrown into wagons like logs, then driven away and pitched into a large\r\nhole or trench, and covered up like dead brutes.”\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the custom of sending the exchanged prisoners as far as\r\npossible from their own homes, he says: “I well remember hearing my\r\ngrandfather explain this strange conduct of the enemy in the following\r\nway. Alter the poison was thus perfidiously administered, the prisoners\r\nbelonging at the North were sent across to the Jersey side, while those\r\nof the South were sent in an opposite direction, the intention of the\r\nenemy evidently being to send the exchanged prisoners as far from home\r\nas possible, that most of them might die of the effect of the poison\r\nbefore reaching their friends. Grandfather used to speak of the\r\ntreatment of our prisoners as most cruel and murderous, though charging\r\nit more to the Tories or Refugees than to the British.\r\n\r\n“The effects of the poison taken into his system were never eradicated\r\nin the life-time of my grandfather, a ‘breaking out,’ or rash, appearing\r\nevery spring, greatly to his annoyance and discomfort.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE CASE OF JOHN BLATCHFORD\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our attempt to describe the sufferings of American prisoners taken\r\nduring the Revolution, we have, for the most part, confined ourselves\r\nto New York, only because we have been unable to make extensive research\r\ninto the records of the British prisons in other places. But what little\r\nwe have been able to gather on the subject of the prisoners sent out of\r\nAmerica we will also lay before our readers.\r\n\r\nWe have already stated the fact that some of our prisoners were sent to\r\nIndia and some to Africa. They seem to have been sold into slavery, and\r\npurchased by the East India Company, and the African Company as well.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful if any of the poor prisoners sent to the unwholesome\r\nclimate of Africa ever returned to tell the story of British cruelties\r\ninflicted upon them there,--where hard work in the burning sun,--scanty\r\nfare,--and jungle fever soon ended their miseries. But one American\r\nprisoner escaped from the Island of Sumatra, where he had been employed\r\nin the pepperfields belonging to the East India Company. His story is\r\neventful, and we will give the reader an abridgement of it, as it was\r\ntold by himself, in his narrative, first published in a New England\r\nnewspaper.\r\n\r\nJohn Blatchford was born at Cape Ann, Mass., in the year 1762. In June,\r\n1777, he went as a cabin boy on board the Hancock, a continental ship\r\ncommanded by Capt. John Manly. On the 8th of July the Hancock was\r\ncaptured by the Rainbow, under Sir George Collier, and her crew was\r\ntaken to Halifax.\r\n\r\nJohn Blatchford was, at this time, in his sixteenth year. He was of\r\nmedium height, with broad shoulders, full chest, and well proportioned\r\nfigure. His complexion was sallow, his eyes dark, and his hair black and\r\ncurly. He united great strength with remarkable endurance, else he could\r\nnot have survived the rough treatment he experienced at the hands of\r\nfate. It is said that as a man he was temperate, grave, and dignified,\r\nand although his strength was so great, and his courage most undaunted,\r\nyet he was peaceable and slow to anger. His narrative appears to have\r\nbeen dictated by himself to some better educated person. It was first\r\npublished in New London, Conn., in the year 1788. In the year 1797\r\nan abstract of it appeared in Philip Freneau’s _Time Piece_, a paper\r\npublished in New York. In July, 1860, the entire production was\r\npublished in the _Cape Ann Gazette_. We will now continue the narrative\r\nin Blatchford’s own words:\r\n\r\n“On our arrival at Halifax we were taken on shore and confined in a\r\nprison which had formerly been a sugar-house.\r\n\r\n“The large number of prisoners confined in this house, near 300,\r\ntogether with a scanty allowance of provisions, occasioned it to be very\r\nsickly. * * * George Barnard, who had been a midshipman on the Hancock,\r\nand who was confined in the same room as myself, concerted a plan to\r\nrelease us, which was to be effected by digging a small passage under\r\nground, to extend to a garden that was behind the prison, and without\r\nthe prison wall, where we might make a breach in the night with safety,\r\nand probably all obtain our liberty. This plan greatly elated our\r\nspirits, and we were anxious to proceed immediately in executing it.\r\n\r\n“Our cabins were built one above another, from the floor to the height\r\nof a man’s head; and mine was pitched upon to be taken up; and six of us\r\nagreed to do the work, whose names were George Barnard, William Atkins,\r\nlate midshipmen in the Hancock; Lemuel Towle of Cape Ann, Isaiah\r\nChurchill of Plymouth; Asa Cole of Weathersfield, and myself.\r\n\r\n“We took up the cabin and cut a hole in the plank underneath. The sugar\r\nhouse stood on a foundation of stone which raised the floor four feet\r\nabove the ground, and gave us sufficient room to work, and to convey\r\naway the dirt that we dug up.\r\n\r\n“The instruments that we had to work with were one scraper, one long\r\nspike, and some sharp sticks; with these we proceeded in our difficult\r\nundertaking. As the hole was too small to admit of more than one person\r\nto work at a time we dug by turns during ten or twelve days, and carried\r\nthe dirt in our bosoms to another part of the cellar. By this time\r\nwe supposed we had dug far enough, and word was given out among the\r\nprisoners to prepare themselves for flight.\r\n\r\n“But while we were in the midst of our gayety, congratulating\r\nourselves upon our prospects, we were basely betrayed by one of our own\r\ncountrymen, whose name was Knowles. He had been a midshipman on board\r\nthe Boston frigate, and was put on board the Fox when she was taken by\r\nthe Hancock and Boston. What could have induced him to commit so vile an\r\naction cannot be conceived, as no advantage could accrue to him from\r\nour detection, and death was the certain consequence to many of his\r\nmiserable countrymen. That it was so is all that I can say. A few\r\nhours before we were to have attempted our escape Knowles informed\r\nthe Sergeant of the guard of our design, and by his treachery cost his\r\ncountry the lives of more than one hundred valuable citizens,--fathers,\r\nand husbands, whose return would have rejoiced the hearts of now\r\nweeping, fatherless children, and called forth tears of joy from wives,\r\nnow helpless and disconsolate widows.\r\n\r\n“When we were discovered the whole guard were ordered into the room and\r\nbeing informed by Knowles who it was that performed the work we were all\r\nsix confined in irons; the hole was filled up and a sentinel constantly\r\nplaced in the room, to prevent any further attempt.\r\n\r\n“We were all placed in close confinement, until two of my\r\nfellow-sufferers, Barnard and Cole, died; one of which was put into the\r\nground with his irons on his hands.\r\n\r\n“I was afterwards permitted to walk the yard. But as my irons were too\r\nsmall, and caused my hands to swell, and made them very sore, I asked\r\nthe Sergeant to take them off and give me larger ones. He being a person\r\nof humanity, and compassionating my sufferings, changed my irons for\r\nothers that were larger, and more easy to my hands.\r\n\r\n“Knowles, who was also permitted to walk the yard, for his perfidy,\r\nwould take every opportunity to insult and mortify me, by asking me\r\nwhether I wanted to run away again, and when I was going home, etc?\r\n\r\n“His daily affronts, together with his conduct in betraying, his\r\ncountrymen, so exasperated me that I wished for nothing more than an\r\nopportunity to convince him that I did not love him.\r\n\r\n“One day as he was tantalizing over me as usual, I suddenly drew my one\r\nhand out of my irons, flew at him and struck him in the face, knocked\r\nout two or three of his teeth, and bruised his mouth very much. He cried\r\nout that the prisoner had got loose, but before any assistance came, I\r\nhad put my hand again into the hand-cuff, and was walking about the\r\nyard as usual. When the guard came they demanded of me in what manner I\r\nstruck him. I replied with both my hands.\r\n\r\n“They then tried to pull my hands out, but could not, and concluded it\r\nmust be as I said. Some laughed and some were angry, but in the end I\r\nwas ordered again into prison.\r\n\r\n“The next day I was sent on board the Greyhound, frigate, Capt. Dickson,\r\nbound on a cruise in Boston Bay.\r\n\r\n“After being out a few days we met with a severe gale of wind, in which\r\nwe sprung our main-mast, and received considerable other damage. We were\r\nthen obliged to bear away for the West Indies, and on our passage fell\r\nin with and took a brig from Norwich, laden with stock.\r\n\r\n“The Captain and hands were put on board a Danish vessel the same day.\r\nWe carried the brig into Antigua, where we immediately repaired, and\r\nwere ordered in company of the Vulture, sloop of war, to convoy a sloop\r\nof merchantmen into New York.\r\n\r\n“We left the fleet off Sandy Hook, and sailed for Philadelphia, where\r\nwe lay until we were made a packet, and ordered for Halifax with\r\ndispatches. We had a quick passage, and arrived safe.\r\n\r\n“While we lay in the road Admiral Byron arrived, in the Princess Royal\r\nfrom England, who, being short of men, and we having a surplusage for\r\na packet, many of our men were ordered on board the Princess Royal, and\r\namong them most of our boat’s crew.\r\n\r\n“Soon after, some of the officers going on shore, I was ordered into the\r\nboat. We landed at the Governor’s slip--it being then near night. This\r\nwas the first time since I had been on board the Greyhound that I\r\nhad had an opportunity to escape from her, as they were before this\r\nparticularly careful of me; therefore I was determined to get away if\r\npossible, and to effect it I waded round a wharf and went up a byway,\r\nfearing I should meet the officers. I soon got into the street, and made\r\nthe best of my way towards Irishtown (the southern suburbs of Halifax)\r\nwhere I expected to be safe, but unfortunately while running I was met\r\nand stopped by an emissary, who demanded of me my business, and where I\r\nwas going? I tried to deceive him, that he might let me pass, but it was\r\nin vain, he ordered me to follow him.\r\n\r\n“I offered him what money I had, about seven shillings, sixpence, to let\r\nme go, this too was in vain. I then told him I was an American, making\r\nmy escape, from a long confinement, and was determined to pass, and took\r\nup a stone. He immediately drew his bayonet, and ordered me to go back\r\nwith him. I refused and told him to keep his distance. He then run upon\r\nme and pushed his bayonet into my side. It come out near my navel;\r\nbut the wound was not very deep; he then made a second pass at me, and\r\nstabbed me through my arm; he was about to stab me a third time, when\r\nI struck him with the stone and knocked him down. I then run, but the\r\nguard who had been alarmed, immediately took me and carried me before\r\nthe Governor, where I understood the man was dead.\r\n\r\n“I was threatened with every kind of death, and ordered out of the\r\nGovernor’s presence. * * * Next day I was sent on board the Greyhound,\r\nthe ship I had run from, and we sailed for England. Our captain being\r\na humane man ordered my irons off, a few days after we sailed, and\r\npermitted me to do duty as formerly. Being out thirteen days we spoke\r\nthe Hazard sloop of war, who informed that the French fleet was then\r\ncruising in the English Channel. For this reason we put into Cork, and\r\nthe dispatches were forwarded to England.\r\n\r\n“While we lay in the Cove of Cork I jumped overboard with the intention\r\nof getting away; unfortunately I was discovered and fired at by the\r\nmarines; the boat was immediately sent after me, took me up, and carried\r\nme on board again. At this time almost all the officers were on shore,\r\nand the ship was left in charge of the sailing-master, one Drummond, who\r\nbeat me most cruelly. To get out of his way I run forward, he followed\r\nme, and as I was running back he came up with me and threw me down the\r\nmain-hold. The fall, together with the beating was so severe that I was\r\ndeprived of my senses for a considerable time. When I recovered them\r\nI found myself in the carpenter’s berth, placed upon some old canvas\r\nbetween two chests, having my right thigh, leg and arm broken, and\r\nseveral parts of my body severely bruised. In this situation I lay\r\neighteen days till our officers, who had been on business to Dublin,\r\ncame on board. The captain inquired for the prisoners, and on being\r\ninformed of my situation came down with the doctor to set my bones, but\r\nfinding them callussed they concluded not to meddle with me.\r\n\r\n“The ship lay at Cork until the French fleet left the Channel, and then\r\nsailed for Spithead. On our arrival there I was sent in irons on\r\nboard the Princess Amelia, and the next day was carried on board the\r\nBrittania, in Portsmouth Harbor, to be tried before Sir Thomas Pye, lord\r\nhigh admiral of England, and President of the court martial.\r\n\r\n“Before the officers had collected I was put under the care of a\r\nsentinel, and the seamen and women who came on board compassionated my\r\nsufferings, which rather heightened than diminished my distress.\r\n\r\n“I was sitting under the awning, almost overpowered by the reflection\r\nof my unhappy situation, every morning expecting to be summoned for my\r\ntrial, when I heard somebody enquire for the prisoner, and supposing it\r\nto be an officer I rose up and answered that I was there.\r\n\r\n“The gentleman came to me, told me to be of good chear, and taking out a\r\nbottle of cordial, bade me drink, which I did. He then enquired where I\r\nbelonged. I informed him. He asked me if I had parents living, and if I\r\nhad any friends in England? I answered I had neither. He then assured me\r\nhe was my friend, and would render me all the assistance in his power.\r\nHe then enquired of me every circumstance relative to my fray with the\r\nman at Halifax, for whose death I was now to be tried and instructed me\r\nwhat to say on my trial, etc.”\r\n\r\nWhether this man was a philanthropist, or an agent for the East India\r\nCompany, we do not know. He instructed Blatchford to plead guilty, and\r\nthen defended him from the charge of murder, no doubt on the plea\r\nof self-defence. Blatchford was therefore acquitted of murder, but\r\napparently sold to the East India Company as a slave. How this was\r\ncondoned we do not know, but will let the poor sailor continue his\r\nnarrative in his own words.\r\n\r\n“I was carried on board an Indiaman, and immediately put down into the\r\nrun, where I was confined ten days. * * * On the seventh day I heard the\r\nboatswain pipe all hands, and about noon I was called up on board, where\r\nI found myself on board the Princess Royal, Captain Robert Kerr, bound\r\nto the East Indies, with six others, all large ships belonging to the\r\nEast India Company.” He had been told that he was to be sent back to\r\nAmerica to be exchanged, and his disappointment amounted almost to\r\ndespair.\r\n\r\n“Our captain told me if I behaved well and did my duty I should receive\r\nas good usage as any man on board; this gave me great encouragement. I\r\nnow found my destiny fixed, that whatever I could do would not in the\r\nleast alter my situation, and therefor was determined to do the best I\r\ncould, and make myself as contented as my unfortunate situation would\r\nadmit.\r\n\r\n“After being on board seven days I found there were in the Princess\r\nRoyal 82 Americans, all destined to the East Indies, for being what they\r\ncalled ‘Rebels.’\r\n\r\n“We had a passage of seventeen weeks to St Helena, where we put in and\r\nlanded part of our cargo, which consisted wholly of provisions. * * *\r\nThe ship lay here about three weeks. We then sailed for Batavia, and on\r\nthe passage touched at the Cape of Good Hope, where we found the\r\nwhole of the fleet that sailed with us from England. We took in some\r\nprovisions and necessaries, and set sail for Batavia, where we arrived\r\nin ten weeks. Here we purchased a large quantity of arrack, and remained\r\na considerable time.\r\n\r\n“We then sailed for Bencoulen in the Island of Sumatria, and after a\r\npassage of about six weeks arrived there. This was in June, 1780.\r\n\r\n“At this place the Americans were all carried on shore, and I found that\r\nI was no longer to remain on board the ship, but condemned to serve as a\r\nsoldier for five years. I offered to bind myself to the captain for five\r\nyears, or any longer term if I might serve on board the ship. He told me\r\nit was impossible for me to be released from acting as a soldier, unless\r\nI could pay £50, sterling. As I was unable to do this I was obliged to\r\ngo through the manual exercise with the other prisoners; among whom was\r\nWm. Randall of Boston, and Josiah Folgier of Nantucket, both young men,\r\nand one of them an old ship-mate of mine.\r\n\r\n“These two and myself agreed to behave as ignorant and awkward as\r\npossible, and what motions we learned one day we were to forget the\r\nnext. We pursued this conduct nearly a fortnight, and were beaten every\r\nday by the drill-sergeant who exercised us, and when he found we were\r\ndetermined, in our obstinacy, and that it was not possible for him\r\nto learn us anything, we were all three sent into the pepper gardens\r\nbelonging to the East India Company; and continued picking peppers\r\nfrom morning till night, and allowed but two scanty meals a day. This,\r\ntogether with the amazing heat of the sun, the island lying under the\r\nequator, was too much for an American constitution, unused to a hot\r\nclimate, and we expected that we should soon end our misery and our\r\nlives; but Providence still preserved us for greater hardships.\r\n\r\n“The Americans died daily with heat and hard fare, which determined my\r\ntwo comrades and myself in an endeavor to make our escape. We had been\r\nin the pepper-gardens four months when an opportunity offered, and we\r\nresolved upon trying our fortune. Folgier, Randall and myself sat out\r\nwith an intention of reaching Croy (a small harbor where the Dutch often\r\ntouched at to water, on the opposite side of the island). Folgier had by\r\nsome means got a bayonet, which he fixed in the end of a stick. Randall\r\nand myself had nothing but staves, which were all the weapons we carried\r\nwith us. We provided ourselves with fireworks [he means flints to strike\r\nfire] for our journey, which we pursued unmolested till the fourth day\r\njust at night, when we heard a rustle in the bushes and discovered nine\r\nsepoys, who rushed out upon us.\r\n\r\n“Folgier being the most resolute of us run at one of them, and pushed\r\nhis bayonet through his body into a tree. Randall knocked down another;\r\nbut they overpowered us, bound us, and carried us back to the fort,\r\nwhich we reached in a day and a half, though we had been four days\r\ntravelling from it, owing to the circle we made by going round the\r\nshore, and they came across the woods being acquainted with the way.\r\n\r\n“Immediately on our arrival at the fort the Governor called a court\r\nmartial, to have us tried. We were soon all condemned to be shot next\r\nmorning at seven o’clock, and ordered to be sent into the dungeon and\r\nconfined in irons, where we were attended by an adjutant who brought a\r\npriest with him to pray and converse with us, but Folgier, who hated the\r\nsight of an Englishman, desired that we might be left alone. * * *\r\nthe clergyman reprimanded him, and told him he made very light of his\r\nsituation on the supposition that he would be reprieved; but if\r\nhe expected it he deceived himself. Folgier still persisted in the\r\nclergyman’s leaving us, if he would have us make our peace with God,\r\n‘for,’ said he, ‘the sight of Englishmen, from whom we have received\r\nsuch treatment, is more disagreeable than the evil spirits of which you\r\nhave spoken;’ that, if he could have his choice, he would choose death\r\nin preference to life, if he must have it on the condition of such\r\nbarbarous usage as he had received from their hands; and the thoughts of\r\ndeath did not seem so hideous to him as his past sufferings.\r\n\r\n“He visited us again about midnight, but finding his company was not\r\nacceptable, he soon left us to our melancholy reflections.\r\n\r\n“Before sunrise we heard the drums beat, and soon after heard the\r\ndireful noise of the door grating on its iron hinges. We were all taken\r\nout, our irons taken off, and we conducted by a strong guard of soldiers\r\nto the parade, surrounded by a circle of armed men, and led into\r\nthe midst of them, where three white officers were placed by our\r\nside;--silence was then commanded, and the adjutant taking a paper out\r\nof his pocket read our sentence;--and now I cannot describe my feelings\r\nupon this occasion, nor can it be felt by any one but those who have\r\nexperienced some remarkable deliverance from the grim hand of death,\r\nwhen surrounded on all sides, and nothing but death expected from\r\nevery quarter, and by Divine Providence there is some way found out for\r\nescape--so it seemed to me when the adjutant pulled out another\r\npaper from his pocket and read: ‘That the Governor and Council, in\r\nconsideration of the youth of Randall and myself, supposing us to be\r\nled on by Folgier, who was the oldest, thought proper to pardon us from\r\ndeath, and that instead we were to receive 800 lashes each.’\r\n\r\n“Although this last sentence seemed terrible to me, yet in comparison\r\nwith death, it seemed to be light. Poor Folgier was shot in our\r\npresence,--previous to which we were told we might go and converse with\r\nhim. Randall went and talked with him first, and after him I went up to\r\ntake my leave, but my feelings were such at the time I had not power to\r\nutter a single word to my departing friend, who seemed as undaunted and\r\nseemingly as willing to die as I was to be released, and told me not\r\nto forget the promises we had formerly made to each other, which was to\r\nembrace the first opportunity to escape.\r\n\r\n“We parted, and he was immediately after shot dead. We were next taken\r\nand tied, and the adjutant brought a small whip made of cotton, which\r\nconsisted of a number of strands and knotted at the ends; but these\r\nknots were all cut off by the adjutant before the drummer took it, which\r\nmade it not worse than to have been whipped with cotton yarn.\r\n\r\n“After being whipped 800 lashes we were sent to the Company’s hospital,\r\nwhere we had been about three weeks when Randall told me he intended\r\nvery soon to make his escape:--This somewhat surprised me, as I had lost\r\nall hopes of regaining my liberty, and supposed he had. I told him I\r\nhad hoped he would never mention it again; but however, if that was his\r\ndesign, I would accompany him. He advised me, if I was fearful, to tarry\r\nbehind; but finding he was determined on going, I resolved to run\r\nthe risque once more; and as we were then in a hospital we were not\r\nsuspected of such a design.\r\n\r\n“Having provided ourselves with fire-works, and knives, about the\r\nfirst of December, 1780, we sat out, with the intent to reach the Dutch\r\nsettlement of Croy, which is about two or three hundred miles distance\r\nupon a direct line, but as we were obliged to travel along the coast\r\n(fearing to risque the nearest way), it was a journey of 800 miles.\r\n\r\n“We took each a stick and hung it around our neck, and every day cut a\r\nnotch, which was the method we took to keep time.\r\n\r\n“In this manner we travelled, living upon fruit, turtle eggs, and\r\nsometimes turtle, which we cooked every night with the fire we built\r\nto secure us from wild beasts, they being in great plenty,--such as\r\nbuffaloes, tigers, jackanapes, leopards, lions, and baboons and monkies.\r\n\r\n“On the 30th day of our traveling we met with nothing we could eat and\r\nfound no water. At night we found some fruit which appeared to the eyes\r\nto be very delicious, different from any we had seen in our travels. It\r\nresembled a fruit which grows in the West Indies, called a Jack, about\r\nthe size of an orange. We being very dry and hungry immediately gathered\r\nsome of this fruit, but finding it of a sweet, sickish taste, I eat but\r\ntwo. Randall eat freely. In the evening we found we were poisoned: I\r\nwas sick and puked considerably, Randall was sick and began to swell\r\nall round his body. He grew worse all night, but continued to have his\r\nsenses till the next day, when he died, and left me to mourn my greater\r\nwretchedness,--more than 400 miles from any settlement, no companion,\r\nthe wide ocean on one side, and a prowling wilderness on the other,\r\nliable to many kinds of death, more terrible than being shot.\r\n\r\n“I laid down by Randall’s body, wishing, if possible, that he might\r\nreturn and tell me what course to take. My thoughts almost distracted\r\nme, so that I was unable to do anything untill the next day, during all\r\nwhich time I continued by the side of Randall. I then got up and made a\r\nhole in the sand and buried him.\r\n\r\n“I now continued my journey as well as the weak state of my body would\r\npermit,--the weather being at the time extremely hot and rainy.\r\nI frequently lay down and would wish that I might never rise\r\nagain;--despair had almost wholly possessed me; and sometimes in a\r\nkind of delirium I would fancy I heard my mother’s voice, and my father\r\ncalling me, and I would answer them. At other times my wild imagination\r\nwould paint to my view scenes which I was acquainted with. Then\r\nsupposing myself near home I would run as fast as my legs could carry\r\nme. Frequently I fancied that I heard dogs bark, men cutting wood, and\r\nevery noise which I have heard in my native country.\r\n\r\n“One day as I was travelling a small dog, as I thought it to be, came\r\nfawning round me and followed me, but I soon discovered it to be a\r\nyoung lion. I supposed that its dam must be nigh, and therefore run. It\r\nfollowed me some time and then left me. I proceeded on, but had not got\r\nfar from it before it began to cry. I looked round and saw a lioness\r\nmaking towards it. She yelled most frightfully, which greatly terrified\r\nme; but she laid down something from her mouth for her young one, and\r\nthen with another yell turned and went off from me.\r\n\r\n“Some days after I was travelling by the edge of a woods, which from its\r\nappearance had felt severely the effects of a tornado or hurricane, the\r\ntrees being all torn up by the roots, and I heard a crackling noise in\r\nthe bushes. Looking about I saw a monstrous large tiger making slowly\r\ntowards me, which frightened me exceedingly. When he had approached\r\nwithin a few rods of me, in my surprise I lifted up my hands and\r\nhollowed very loud. The sudden noise frightened him, seemingly as much\r\nas I had been, and he immediately turned and run into the woods, and I\r\nsaw him no more.\r\n\r\n“After this I continued to travel on without molestation, only from the\r\nmonkies who were here so plentiful that oftentimes I saw them in large\r\ndroves; sometimes I run from them, as if afraid of them, they would then\r\nfollow, grin, and chatter at me, and when they got near I would turn,\r\nand they would run from me back into the woods, and climb the trees to\r\nget out of my way.\r\n\r\n“It was now 15 weeks since I had left the hospital. I had travelled most\r\nall of the day without any water and began to be very thirsty, when I\r\nheard the sound of running water, as it were down a fall of rocks. I\r\nhad heard it a considerable time and at last began to suspect it was\r\nnothing, but imaginary, as many other noises I had before thought\r\nto have heard. I however went on as fast as I could, and at length\r\ndiscovered a brook. On approaching it I was not a little surprised and\r\nrejoiced by the sight of a Female Indian, who was fishing at the\r\nbrook. She had no other dress on than that which mother nature affords\r\nimpartially to all her children, except a small cloth which she wore\r\nround her waist.\r\n\r\n“I knew not how to address myself to her. I was afraid if I spoke she\r\nwould run, and therefore I made a small noise; upon which she looked\r\nround, and seeing me, run across the brook, seemingly much frightened,\r\nleaving her fishing line. I went up to her basket which contained five\r\nor six fish which looked much like our trout. I took up the basket and\r\nattempted to wade across where she had passed, but was too weak to wade\r\nacross in that place, and went further up the stream, where I passed\r\nover, and then looking for the Indian woman I saw her at some distance\r\nbehind a large cocoa-nut tree. I walked towards her but dared not keep\r\nmy eyes steadily upon her lest she would run as she did before. I called\r\nto her in English, and she answered in her own tongue, which I could not\r\nunderstand. I then called to her in the Malaysian, which I understood\r\na little of; she answered me in a kind of surprise and asked me in the\r\nname of Okrum Footee (the name of their God) from whence I came, and\r\nwhere I was going. I answered her as well as I could in the Melais, that\r\nI was from Fort Marlborough, and going to Croy--that I was making my\r\nescape from the English, by whom I had been taken in war. She told me\r\nthat she had been taken by the Malays some years before, for that the\r\ntwo nations were always at war, and that she had been kept as a slave\r\namong them three years and was then retaken by her countrymen. While we\r\nwere talking together she appeared to be very shy, and I durst not come\r\nnearer than a rod to her, lest she should run from me. She said that\r\nCroy, the place I was bound to, was about three miles distant: That if I\r\nwould follow her she would conduct me to her countrymen, who were but a\r\nsmall distance off. I begged her to plead with her countrymen to spare\r\nmy life. She said she would, and assured me that if I behaved well I\r\nshould not be hurt. She then conducted me to a small village, consisting\r\nof huts or wigwams. When we arrived at the village the children that saw\r\nme were frightened and run away from me, and the women exhibited a great\r\ndeal of fear and kept at a distance. But my guide called to them and\r\ntold them not to be afraid, for that I was not come to hurt them, and\r\nthen informed them from whence I came, and that I was going to Croy.\r\n\r\n“I told my guide I was very hungry, and she sent the children for\r\nsomething for me to eat. They came and brought me little round balls\r\nof rice, and they, not daring to come nigh, threw them at me. These I\r\npicked up and eat. Afterwards a woman brought some rice and goat’s milk\r\nin a copper bason, and setting it on the ground made signs for me to\r\ntake it up and eat it, which I did, and then put the bason down again.\r\nThey then poked away the bason with a stick, battered it with stones,\r\nand making a hole in the ground, buried it.\r\n\r\n“After that they conducted me to a small hut, and told me to tarry there\r\nuntil the morning, when they would conduct me to the harbor. I had but\r\nlittle sleep that night, and was up several time to look out, and saw\r\ntwo or three Indians at a little distance from the hut, who I supposed\r\nwere placed there to watch me.\r\n\r\n“Early in the morning numbers came around the hut, and the female\r\nwho was my guide asked me where my country was? I could not make her\r\nunderstand, only that it was at a great distance. She then asked me if\r\nmy countrymen eat men? I told her, no, and seeing some goats pointed at\r\nthem, and told her we eat such as them. She then asked me what made me\r\nwhite, and if it was not the white rain that come upon us when we were\r\nsmall * * * as I wished to please them I told her that I supposed it\r\nwas, for it was only in certain seasons of the year that it fell, and\r\nin hot weather when it did not fall the people grew darker until it\r\nreturned, and then the people all grew white again. This seemed to\r\nplease them very much.\r\n\r\n“My protectress then brought a young man to me who she said was her\r\nbrother, and who would show me the way to the harbour. She then cut a\r\nstick about eight feet long, and he took hold of one end and gave me the\r\nother. She told me that she had instructed her brother what to say at\r\nthe harbour. He then led off, and I followed. During our walk I put\r\nout my hand to him several times, and made signs of friendship, but he\r\nseemed to be afraid of me, and would look upwards and then fall flat on\r\nthe ground and kiss it: this he repeated as often as I made any sign or\r\ntoken of friendship to him.\r\n\r\n“When we had got near the harbor he made a sign for me to sit down upon\r\na rock, which I did. He then left me and went, as I supposed, to talk to\r\nthe people at the water concerning me; but I had not sat long before I\r\nsaw a vessel coming round the point into the harbor.\r\n\r\n“They soon came on shore in the boat. I went down to them and made my\r\ncase known and when the boat returned on board they took me with them.\r\nIt was a Dutch snow bound from China to Batavia. After they had wooded\r\nand watered they set sail for Batavia:--being out about three weeks we\r\narrived there: I tarried on board her about three weeks longer, and\r\nthen got on board a Spanish ship which was from Rio de la Plate bound to\r\nSpain, but by stress of weather was obliged to put into this port. After\r\nthe vessel had repaired we sailed for Spain. When we made the Cape of\r\nGood Hope we fell in with two British cruisers of twenty guns each, who\r\nengaged us and did the vessel considerable damage, but at length we beat\r\nthem off, and then run for the coast of Brazil, where we arrived safe,\r\nand began to work at repairing our ship, but upon examination she\r\nwas found to be not fit to proceed on her voyage. She was therefore\r\ncondemned. I then left her and got on board a Portuguese snow bound up\r\nto St. Helena, and we arrived safe at that place.\r\n\r\n“I then went on shore and quitted her and engaged in the garrison there\r\nto do duty as a soldier for my provisions till some ship should arrive\r\nthere bound for England. After serving there a month I entered on board\r\na ship called the Stormont, but orders were soon after received that no\r\nIndiaman should sail without convoy; and we lay here six months, during\r\nwhich time the Captain died.\r\n\r\n“While I was in St. Helena the vessel in which I came out from England\r\narrived here, homeward bound; she being on the return from her second\r\nvoyage since I came from England. And now I made known my case to\r\nCaptain Kerr, who readily took me on board the Princess Royal, and used\r\nme kindly and those of my old ship-mates on board were glad to see me\r\nagain. Captain Kerr on first seeing me asked me if I was not afraid to\r\nlet him know who I was, and endeavored to frighten me; yet his conduct\r\ntowards me was humane and kind.\r\n\r\n“It had been very sickly on board the Princess Royal, and the greater\r\npart of the hands who came out of England in her had died, and she\r\nwas now manned chiefly with lascars. Among those who had died was the\r\nboatswain, and boatswain’s mate, and Captain Kerr made me boatswain of\r\nthe ship, in which office I continued until we arrived in London, and it\r\nprotected me from being impressed upon our arrival in England.\r\n\r\n“We sailed from St. Helena about the first of November, 1781, under\r\nconvoy of the Experiment of fifty guns, commanded by Captain Henry, and\r\nthe Shark sloop of war of 18 guns, and we arrived in London about the\r\nfirst of March, 1782, it having been about two years and a half from the\r\ntime I had left it.\r\n\r\n“In about a fortnight after our arrival in London I entered on board the\r\nKing George, a store-ship bound to Antigua, and after four weeks passage\r\narrived there.\r\n\r\n“The second night after we came to anchor in Antigua I took the ship’s\r\nboat and escaped in her to Montserrat (in the West Indies) which place\r\nhad but just before been taken by the French.\r\n\r\n“Here I did not meet with the treatment which I expected; for on my\r\narrival at Montserrat I was immediately taken up and put in prison,\r\nwhere I continued twenty-four hours, and my boat taken from me. I was\r\nthen sent to Guadaloupe, and examined by the Governor. I made known my\r\ncase to him, by acquainting him with the misfortunes I had gone through\r\nin my captivity, and in making my escape. He seemed to commiserate\r\nme, gave me ten dollars for the boat that I escaped in, and provided\r\na passage for me on board a French brigantine that was bound from\r\nGaudaloupe to Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n“The vessel sailed in a few days, and now my prospects were favorable,\r\nbut my misfortunes were not to end here, for after being out twenty-one\r\ndays we fell in with the Anphitrite and Amphene, two British cruizers,\r\noff the Capes of Delaware, by which we were taken, carried in to New\r\nYork and put on board the Jersey prison ship. After being on board about\r\na week a cartel was fitted out for France, and I was sent on board as\r\na French prisoner. The cartel was ordered for St. Maloes, and after a\r\npassage of thirty-two days we arrived safe at that place.\r\n\r\n“Finding no American vessel at St. Male’s, I went to the Commandant, and\r\nprocured a pass to go by land to Port l’Orient. On my arrival there\r\nI found three American privateers belonging to Beverley in the\r\nMassachusetts. I was much elated at seeing so many of my countrymen,\r\nsome of whom I was well acquainted with. I immediately entered on board\r\nthe Buccaneer, Captain Pheirson. We sailed on a cruise, and after being\r\nout eighteen days we returned to L’Orient with six prizes. Three days\r\nafter our arrival in port we heard the joyful news of peace; on which\r\nthe privateer was dismantled, the people discharged, and Captain P\r\nsailed on a merchant voyage to Norway.\r\n\r\n“I then entered on board a brig bound to Lisbon (Captain Ellenwood of\r\nBeverley) and arrived at Lisbon in eight days. We took in a cargo of\r\nsalt, and sailed for Beverley, where we arrived the ninth of May, 1783.\r\nBeing now only fifteen miles from home, I immediately set out for Cape\r\nAnn, went to my father’s house, and had an agreeable meeting with my\r\nfriends, after an absence of almost six years.\r\n\r\n“John Blatchford\r\n\r\n“New London, May 10th, 1788.\r\n\r\n“N. B. Those who are acquainted with the narrator will not scruple to\r\ngive full credence to the foregoing account, and others may satisfy\r\nthemselves by conversing with him. The scars he carries are a proof of\r\nhis narrative, and a gentleman of New London who was several months with\r\nhim, was acquainted with part of his sufferings, though it was out of\r\nhis power to relieve him. He is a poor man with a wife and two children.\r\nHis employment is fishing and coasting. _Editor_.”\r\n\r\nOur readers may be interested to know what became of John Blatchford,\r\nwho wrote, or dictated, the narrative we have given, in the year 1788.\r\nHe was, at that time, a married man. He had married a young woman named\r\nAnn Grover. He entered the merchant marine, and died at Port au Prince\r\nabout the year 1794, when nearly thirty-three years of age. Thus early\r\nclosed the career of a brave man, who had experienced much hardship, and\r\nhad suffered greatly from man’s inhumanity to man, and who is, as far\r\nas we know, the only American prisoner sent to the East Indies who ever\r\nreturned to tell the story of the barbarities inflicted upon him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nBENJAMIN FRANKLIN AND OTHERS ON THE SUBJECT OF AMERICAN PRISONERS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Benjamin Franklin and Silas Deane were in Paris they wrote the\r\nfollowing letter to Lord Stormont, the English Ambassador to France.\r\n\r\nParis, April 2nd, 1777.\r\n\r\nMy Lord:--\r\n\r\nWe did ourselves the honor of writing some time since to your Lordship\r\non the subject of exchanging prisoners: you did not condescend to give\r\nus any answer, and therefore we expect none to this. We, however, take\r\nthe liberty of sending you copies of certain depositions which we shall\r\ntransmit to Congress, whereby it will be known to your Court, that the\r\nUnited States are not unacquainted with the barbarous treatment their\r\npeople receive when they have the misfortune to be your prisoners here\r\nin Europe, and that if your conduct towards us is not altered, it is\r\nnot unlikely that severe reprisals may be thought justifiable from a\r\nnecessity of putting some check to such abominable practices. For the\r\nsake of humanity it is to be wished that men would endeavor to alleviate\r\nthe unavoidable miseries attending a state of war. It has been said that\r\namong the civilized nations of Europe the ancient horrors of that state\r\nare much diminished; but the compelling men by chains, stripes, and\r\nfamine to fight against their friends and relatives, is a new mode of\r\nbarbarity, which your nation alone has the honor of inventing, and the\r\nsending American prisoners of war to Africa and Asia, remote from all\r\nprobability of exchange, and where they can scarce hope ever to hear\r\nfrom their families, even if the unwholesomeness of the climate does not\r\nput a speedy end to their lives, is a manner of treating captives that\r\nyou can justify by no other precedent or custom except that of the\r\nblack savages of Guinea. We are your Lordship’s most obedient, humble\r\nservants, Benjamin Franklin, Silas Deane.\r\n\r\nThe reply to this letter was laconic.\r\n\r\n“The King’s Ambassador recognizes no letters from Rebels, except when\r\nthey come to ask mercy.”\r\n\r\nInclosed in the letter from our representatives were the following\r\ndepositions.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEPOSITION OF ELIPHALET DOWNER\r\n\r\nEliphalet Downer, Surgeon, taken in the Yankee privateer, testifies\r\nthat after he was made prisoner by Captains Ross and Hodge, who took\r\nadvantage of the generous conduct of Captain Johnson of the Yankee\r\nto them his prisoners, and of the confidence he placed in them in\r\nconsequence of that conduct and their assurances; he and his countrymen\r\nwere closely confined, yet assured that on their arrival in port they\r\nshould be set at liberty, and these assurances were repeated in the most\r\nsolemn manner, instead of which they were, on their approach to land,\r\nin the hot weather of August, shut up in a small cabin; the windows of\r\nwhich were spiked down and no air admitted, insomuch that they were all\r\nin danger of suffocation from the excessive heat.\r\n\r\nThree or four days after their arrival in the river Thames they were\r\nrelieved from this situation in the middle of the night, hurried on\r\nboard a tender and sent down to Sheerness, where the deponent was\r\nput into the Ardent, and there falling sick of a violent fever in\r\nconsequence of such treatment, and languishing in that situation for\r\nsome time, he was removed, still sick, to the Mars, and notwithstanding\r\nrepeated petitions to be suffered to be sent to prison on shore, he was\r\ndetained until having the appearance of a mortification in his legs, he\r\nwas sent to Haslar hospital, from whence after recovering his health, he\r\nhad the good fortune to make his escape.\r\n\r\nWhile on board those ships and in the hospital he was informed and\r\nbelieves that many of his countrymen, after experiencing even worse\r\ntreatment than he, were sent to the East Indies, and many of those taken\r\nat Quebec were sent to the coast of Africa, as soldiers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEPOSITION OF CAPTAIN SETH CLARK OF NEWBURY PORT IN THE STATE OF\r\nMASSACHUSETTS BAY IN AMERICA\r\n\r\n“This deponent saith that on his return from Cape Nichola Mole to\r\nNewbury Port, he was taken on the 17th of September last by an armed\r\nschooner in his British Majesty’s service, ---- Coats, Esquire,\r\nCommander, and carried down to Jamaica, on his arrival at which place\r\nhe was sent on board the Squirrel, another armed vessel, ---- Douglas,\r\nEsquire, Commander, where, although master and half owner of the vessel\r\nin which he was taken, he was returned as a common sailor before the\r\nmast, and in that situation sailed for England in the month of November,\r\non the twenty-fifth of which month they took a schooner from Port a Pie\r\nto Charlestown, S. C., to which place she belonged, when the owner, Mr.\r\nBurt, and the master, Mr. Bean, were brought on board. On the latter’s\r\ndenying he had any ship papers Captain Douglas ordered him to be\r\nstripped and tied up and then whipped with a wire cat of nine tails that\r\ndrew blood every stroke and then on his saying that he had thrown his\r\npapers overboard he was untied and ordered to his duty as a common\r\nsailor, with no place for himself or his people to lay on but the decks.\r\nOn their arrival at Spithead, the deponent was removed to the Monarch,\r\nand there ordered to do duty as a fore-mast-man, and on his refusing on\r\naccount of inability to do it, he was threatened by the Lieutenant,\r\na Mr. Stoney, that if he spoke one word to the contrary he should be\r\nbrought to the gangway, and there severely flogged.\r\n\r\n“After this he was again removed and put on board the Bar-fleur, where\r\nhe remained until the tenth of February. On board this ship the deponent\r\nsaw several American prisoners, who were closely confined and ironed,\r\nwith only four men’s allowance to six. These prisoners and others\r\ninformed this deponent that a number of American prisoners had been\r\ntaken out of the ship and sent to the East Indies and the coast of\r\nAfrica, which he has told would have been his fate, had he arrived\r\nsooner.\r\n\r\n“This deponent further saith, That in Haslar hospital, to which place on\r\naccount of sickness he was removed from the Bar-fleur, he saw a Captain\r\nChase of Providence, New England, who told him he had been taken in\r\na sloop of which he was half owner and master, on his passage from\r\nProvidence to South Carolina, by an English transport, and turned\r\nover to a ship of war, where he was confined in irons thirteen weeks,\r\ninsulted, beat, and abused by the petty officers and common sailors, and\r\non being released from irons was ordered to do duty as a foremost man\r\nuntil his arrival in England, when being dangerously ill he was sent to\r\nsaid hospital.”\r\n\r\nParis March 30th. 1777.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Franklin, in a letter written in 1780, to a Mr. Hartley, an\r\nEnglish gentleman who was opposed to the war, said that Congress\r\nhad investigated the cruelties perpetrated by the English upon their\r\ndefenceless prisoners, and had instructed him to prepare a _school book_\r\nfor the use of American children, to be illustrated by thirty-five\r\ngood engravings, each to picture some scene of horror, some enormity of\r\nsuffering, such as should indelibly impress upon the minds of the school\r\nchildren a dread of British rule, and a hatred of British malice and\r\nwickedness!\r\n\r\nThe old philosopher did not accomplish this task: had he done so it is\r\nimprobable that we would have so long remained in ignorance of some of\r\nthe facts which we are now endeavoring to collect. It will be pleasant\r\nto glance, for a moment, on the other side the subject. It is well known\r\nthat there was a large party in England, who, like Benjamin Franklin’s\r\ncorrespondent, were opposed to the war; men of humanity, fair-minded\r\nenough to sympathize with the struggles of an oppressed people, of the\r\nsame blood as themselves.\r\n\r\n“The Prisoners of 1776, A Relic of the Revolution,” is a little book\r\nedited by the Rev. R. Livesey, and published in Boston, in 1854. The\r\nfacts in this volume were complied from the journal of Charles Herbert\r\nof Newburyport, Mass. This young man was taken prisoner in December,\r\n1776. He was a sailor on board the brigantine Dolton. He and his\r\ncompanions were confined in the Old Mill Prison in Plymouth, England.\r\n\r\nHerbert, who was in his nineteenth year, was a prisoner more than two\r\nyears. He managed to keep a journal during his captivity, and has left\r\nus an account of his treatment by the English which is a pleasant\r\nrelief in its contrast to the dark pictures that we have drawn of the\r\nwretchedness of American prisoners elsewhere. A collection of upwards of\r\n$30,000 was taken up in England for the relief of our prisoners confined\r\nin English jails.\r\n\r\nHerbert secreted his journal in a chest which had a false bottom. It is\r\ntoo long to give in its entirety, but we have made a few extracts which\r\nwill describe the treatment the men received in England, where all\r\nthat was done was open to public inspection, and where no such inhuman\r\nmonsters as Cunningham were suffered to work their evil will upon their\r\nvictims.\r\n\r\n“Dec. 24th, 1776. We were taken by the Reasonable, man-of-war of 64\r\nguns. I put on two shirts, pair of drawers and breeches, and trousers\r\nover them, two or three jackets, and a pair of new shoes, and then\r\nfilled my bosom and pockets as full as I could carry. Nothing but a few\r\nold rags and twelve old blankets were sent to us. Ordered down to the\r\ncable tier. Almost suffocated. Nothing but the bare cable to lie on, and\r\nthat very uneven.\r\n\r\n“Jan. 15, 1777. We hear that the British forces have taken Fort\r\nWashington with a loss of 800.”\r\n\r\nAfter several changes Herbert was put on board the Tarbay, a ship of 74\r\nguns, and confined between decks, with not room for all to lie down at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n“Very cold. Have to lie on a wet deck without blankets. Some obliged to\r\nsit up all night.”\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of February they received flock beds and pillows, rugs, and\r\nblankets. “Ours are a great comfort to us after laying fifty-five nights\r\nwithout any, all the time since we were taken. * * *\r\n\r\n“We are told that the Captain of this ship, whose name is Royer, gave us\r\nthese clothes and beds out of his own pocket.”\r\n\r\nOn the twelfth of April he was carried on shore to the hospital, where\r\nhis daily allowance was a pound of beef, a pound of potatoes, and three\r\npints of beer.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of May he writes: “I now have a pound of bread, half a pound\r\nof mutton and a quart of beer daily. The doctor is very kind. Three of\r\nour company have died.”\r\n\r\nOn the fifth of June he was committed to the Old Mill Prison at\r\nPlymouth. Many entries in his journal record the escapes of his\r\ncompanions. “Captain Brown made his escape.” “William Woodward of the\r\ncharming Sallie escaped, etc., etc.”\r\n\r\nJune 6th he records: “Our allowance here in prison is a pound of beef,\r\na pound of greens, and a quart of beer, and a little pot liquor that\r\nthe greens and beef were boiled in, without any thickening.” Still he\r\ndeclares that he has “a continued gnawing in his stomach.” The people of\r\nthe neighborhood came to see them daily when they were exercising in the\r\nprison yard, and sometimes gave them money and provisions through the\r\npickets of the high fence that surrounded the prison grounds. Herbert\r\nhad a mechanical turn, and made boxes which he sold to these visitors,\r\nprocuring himself many comforts in this manner.\r\n\r\nAbout ten prisoners were brought in daily. They were constantly digging\r\ntheir way out and were sometimes recaptured, but a great number made\r\ntheir escape. On the twentieth of July he records that they begin to\r\nmake a breach in the prison wall. “Their intention is to dig eighteen\r\nfeet underground to get into a field on the other side of the wall.\r\n\r\n“We put all the dirt in our chests.”\r\n\r\nAugust third he says: “There are 173 prisoners in the wards. On the\r\nfifth thirty-two escaped, but three were brought back. These were\r\nconfined in the Black Hole forty days on half allowance, and obliged to\r\nlie on the bare floor.\r\n\r\n“September 12th. We had a paper wherein was a melancholy account of the\r\nbarbarous treatment of American prisoners, taken at Ticonderoga.\r\n\r\n“Sept. 16th. Today about twenty old countrymen petitioned the Board for\r\npermission to go on board His Majesty’s ships.\r\n\r\n“Jan. 7th. 1778. 289 prisoners here in Plymouth. In Portsmouth there\r\nare 140 prisoners. Today the prison was smoked with charcoal and\r\nbrim-stone.”\r\n\r\nHe records the gift of clothes, blankets, and all sorts of provisions.\r\nThey were allowed to wash at the pump in relays of six. Tobacco and\r\neverything necessary was freely given them.\r\n\r\n“Jan. 27th. The officers in a separate prison are allowed to burn\r\ncandles in the evening until gun-fire, which is eight o’clock.\r\n\r\n“28th. Today some new washing troughs were brought up for us to wash our\r\nclothes in; and now we have plenty of clothes, soap, water, and tubs to\r\nwash in. In general we are tolerably clean.\r\n\r\n“Feb. 1st. Sunday. Last evening between 7 and 9 o’clock five of the\r\nofficers in a separate prison, who had agreed with the sentry to let\r\nthem go, made their escape and took two sentries with them. The five\r\nofficers were Captain Henry Johnston, Captain Eleazar Johnston, Offin\r\nBoardman, Samuel Treadwell, and one Mr. Deal.\r\n\r\n“Feb. 8th. Sunday. We have the paper wherein is an account of a letter\r\nfrom Dr. Franklin, Dean, and Lee, to Lord North, and to the ministry,\r\nputting them in mind of the abuse which the prisoners have had from\r\ntime to time, and giving them to know that it is in the power of the\r\nAmericans to make ample retaliation. * * * We learn that their answer\r\nwas that in America there was an exchange.”\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of March he writes: “We are all strong, fat and hearty.\r\n\r\n“March 12th. Today our two fathers came to see us as they generally do\r\nonce or twice a week. They are Mr. Heath, and Mr. Sorry, the former a\r\nPresbyterian minister, in Dock, the latter a merchant in Plymouth. They\r\nare the two agents appointed by the Committee in London to supply us\r\nwith necessaries. A smile from them seems like a smile from a father.\r\nThey tell us that everything goes well on our side.\r\n\r\n“April 7th. Today the latter (Mr. Sorry) came to see us, and we desired\r\nhim, for the future, to send us a four penny white loaf instead of a\r\nsix-penny one to each mess, per day, for we have more provision than\r\nmany of us want to eat, and any person can easily conjecture that\r\nprisoners, in our situation, who have suffered so much for the want of\r\nprovisions would abhor such an act as to waste what we have suffered so\r\nmuch for the want of.”\r\n\r\nHerbert was liberated at the end of two years. Enough has been quoted to\r\nprove the humanity with which the prisoners at Plymouth were treated. He\r\ngives a valuable list of crews in Old Mill Prison, Plymouth, during\r\nthe time of his incarceration, with the names of captains, number that\r\nescaped, those who died, and those who joined the English.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                             Joined\r\n   NAMES OF SHIPS AND CAPTAINS     No. of                   British\r\n                                      Men     Escaped  Died   Ships\r\n   Brig Dolton, Capt.

The English crew put in charge\r\nof the prize procured liquor, and, in company of some of the loose women\r\nof the town, went below to make a night of it. In the dead of night the\r\nFrenchmen seized the ship, secured the hatches, cut the cable, took her\r\nout of port, homeward bound, and escaped.\r\n\r\nA writer in the London _Gazette_ in a letter to the Lord Mayor, dated\r\nAugust 6th, 1776, says: “I was last week on board the American privateer\r\ncalled the Yankee, commanded by Captain Johnson, and lately brought into\r\nthis port by Captain Ross, who commanded one of the West India sugar\r\nships, taken by the privateer in July last: and as an Englishman I\r\nearnestly wish your Lordship, who is so happily placed at the head\r\nof this great city (justly famed for its great humanity even to its\r\nenemies), would be pleased to go likewise, or send proper persons, to\r\nsee the truly shocking and I may say barbarous and miserable condition\r\nof the unfortunate American prisoners, who, however criminal they may\r\nbe thought to have been, are deserving of pity, and entitled to common\r\nhumanity.\r\n\r\n“They are twenty-five in number, and all inhumanly shut close down,\r\nlike wild beasts, in a small stinking apartment, in the hold of a sloop,\r\nabout seventy tons burden, without a breath of air, in this sultry\r\nseason, but what they receive from a small grating overhead, the\r\nopenings in which are not more than two inches square in any part, and\r\nthrough which the sun beats intensely hot all day, only two or three\r\nbeing permitted to come on deck at a time; and then they are exposed in\r\nthe open sun, which is reflected from the decks like a burning glass.\r\n\r\n“I do not at all exaggerate, my lord, I speak the truth, and the\r\nresemblance that this barbarity bears to the memorable Black Hole at\r\nCalcutta, as a gentleman present on Saturday observed, strikes every eye\r\nat the sight. All England ought to know that the same game is now acting\r\nupon the Thames on board this privateer, that all the world cried out\r\nagainst, and shuddered at the mention of in India, some years ago, as\r\npractised on Captain Hollowell and other of the King’s good subjects.\r\nThe putrid steams issuing from the hold are so hot and offensive that\r\none cannot, without the utmost danger, breathe over it, and I should not\r\nbe at all surprised if it should cause a plague to spread.\r\n\r\n“The miserable wretches below look like persons in a hot bath, panting,\r\nsweating, and fainting, for want of air; and the surgeon declares that\r\nthey must all soon perish in this situation, especially as they are\r\nalmost all in a sickly state from bilious disorders.\r\n\r\n“The captain and surgeon, it is true, have the liberty of the cabin (if\r\nit deserves the name of a cabin), and make no complaints on their own\r\naccount. They are both sensible and well behaved young men, and can give\r\na very good account of themselves, having no signs of fear, and being\r\nsupported by a consciousness of the justice of their cause.\r\n\r\n“They are men of character, of good families in New England, and highly\r\nrespected in their different occupations; but being stripped of their\r\nall by the burning of towns, and other destructive measures of the\r\npresent unnatural war, were forced to take the disagreeable method of\r\nmaking reprisals to maintain themselves and their children rather than\r\nstarve. * * * English prisoners taken by the Americans have been treated\r\nwith the most remarkable tenderness and generosity, as numbers who are\r\nsafely returned to England most freely confess, to the honor of our\r\nbrethern in the colonies, and it is a fact, which can be well attested\r\nin London, that this very surgeon on board the privateer, after the\r\nbattle of Lexington, April 19th, 1775, for many days voluntarily and\r\ngenerously without fee or reward employed himself in dressing the King’s\r\nwounded soldiers, who but an hour before would have shot him if\r\nthey could have come at him, and in making a collection for their\r\nrefreshment, of wine, linen, money, etc., in the town where he lived.\r\n* * * The capture of the privateer was, solely owing to the ill-judged\r\nlenity and brotherly kindness of Captain Johnson, who not considering\r\nhis English prisoners in the same light that he would French or Spanish,\r\nput them under no sort of confinement, but permitted them to walk the\r\ndecks as freely as his own people at all times. Taking advantage of this\r\nindulgence the prisoners one day watched their opportunity when most of\r\nthe privateer’s people were below, and asleep, shut down the hatches,\r\nand making all fast, had immediate possession of the vessel without\r\nusing any force.”\r\n\r\nWhat the effect of this generous letter was we have no means of\r\ndiscovering. It displays the sentiments of a large party in England, who\r\nbitterly condemned the “unnatural war against the Colonies.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE ADVENTURES OF ANDREW SHERBURNE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile we are on the subject of the treatment of American prisoners\r\nin England, which forms a most grateful contrast to that which they\r\nreceived in New York, Philadelphia, and other parts of America, we will\r\ngive an abstract of the adventures of another young man who was confined\r\nin the Old Mill Prison at Plymouth, England. This young man was named\r\nAndrew Sherburne. He was born at Rye, New Hampshire, on the 3oth of\r\nSeptember, 1765.\r\n\r\nHe first served on the continental ship of war, Ranger, which shipped\r\na crew at Portsmouth, N. H. His father consented that he should go with\r\nher, and his two half uncles, Timothy and James Weymouth, were on\r\nboard. There were about forty boys in the crew. Andrew was then in his\r\nfourteenth year, and was employed as waiter to the boatswain. The vessel\r\nsailed in the month of June, 1779. She took ten prizes and sailed for\r\nhome, where she arrived in August, 1779. Next year she sailed again on\r\nanother cruise, but was taken prisoner by the British at Charleston, S.\r\nC., on the 12th of May, 1780.\r\n\r\n“Our officers,” says Sherburne, “were paroled and allowed to retain\r\ntheir waiters. We were for several days entirely destitute of provisions\r\nexcept muscles, which we gathered from the muscle beds. I was at this\r\ntime waiter to Captain Pierce Powers, master’s mate of the Ranger. He\r\ntreated me with the kindness of a father.”\r\n\r\n“At this time,” he continues, “Captain Simpson and the other officers\r\nprocured a small vessel which was employed as a cartel, to transport\r\nthe officers, their boys and baggage, agreeably to the terms of\r\ncapitulation, to Newport, R. I. It being difficult to obtain suitable\r\ncasks for water they procured such as they could. These proved to be\r\nfoul, and after we got to sea our water became filthy and extremely\r\nnoxious. Very few if any on board escaped an attack of the diarrhoea.”\r\n\r\nAfter his return he next shipped under Captain Wilds on the Greyhound,\r\nfrom Portsmouth, N. H., and at last, after many adventures, was taken\r\nprisoner by Newfoundlanders, off Newfoundland. He was then put on board\r\nthe Fairy, a British sloop of war, commanded by Captain Yeo, “a complete\r\ntyrant” “Wilds and myself,” he continues, “were called to the quarter\r\ndeck, and after having been asked a few questions by Captain Yeo, he\r\nturned to his officers and said: ‘They are a couple of fine lads for his\r\nMajesty’s service. Mr. Gray, see that they do their duty.’”\r\n\r\nWhen the sloop arrived in England the boys complained that they were\r\nprisoners of war, in consequence of which they were sent to the Old Mill\r\nPrison at Plymouth, accused of “rebellion, piracy, and high treason.”\r\n\r\nHere they found acquaintances from Portsmouth, N. H. The other prisoners\r\nwere very kind to young Sherburne, gave him clothing and sent him to a\r\nschool which was kept in the prison. Ship building and other arts were\r\ncarried on in this place, and he learned navigation, which was of great\r\nservice to him in after life.\r\n\r\nThe fare, he declared, was tolerably good, but there was not enough\r\nof it. He amused himself by making little toy ships. He became ill and\r\ndelirious, but recovered in time to be sent to America when a general\r\nexchange of prisoners was effected in 1781. The rest of his adventures\r\nhas nothing to do with prisons, in England, and shall not now be\r\ndetailed.\r\n\r\nAlthough the accounts of the English prisons left by Herbert, Sherburne\r\nand others are so favorable, yet it seems that, after the year 1780,\r\nthere was some cause of complaint even there. We will quote a passage\r\nfrom the British Annual Register to prove this statement. This passage\r\nwe take from the Register for 1781, page 152.\r\n\r\n“A petition was presented to the House the same day (June 20th) by Mr.\r\nFox, from the American prisoners in Mill Prison, Plymouth, setting forth\r\nthat they were treated with less humanity than the French and Spanish,\r\nthough by reason that they had no Agent established in this country\r\nfor their protection, they were entitled to expect a larger share of\r\nindulgence than others. They had not a sufficient allowance of _bread_,\r\nand were very scantily furnished with clothing.\r\n\r\n“A similar petition was presented to the House of Peers by the Duke of\r\nRichmond, and these petitions occasioned considerable debate in both\r\nHouses. Several motions were grounded on these petitions, but to those\r\nproposed by the Lords and gentlemen in the opposition, were determined\r\nin the negative, and others to _exculpate_ the Government in this\r\nbusiness were resolved in the affirmative. It appeared upon inquiry,\r\nthat the American prisoners were allowed a half pound of bread less\r\nper day than the French and Spanish prisoners. But the petitions of the\r\nAmericans produced no alterations in their favor, and the conduct of\r\nthe Administration was equally unpolitic and illiberal. The additional\r\nallowance, which was solicited on behalf of the prisoners, could be\r\nno object, either to Government or to the Nation, and it was certainly\r\nunwise, by treating American prisoners worse than those of France or\r\nSpain, to increase the fatal animosity which had unhappily taken place\r\nbetween the mother country and the Colonies, and this, too, at a period\r\nwhen the subjugation of the latter had become hopeless.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nMORE ABOUT THE ENGLISH PRISONS--MEMOIR OF ELI BICKFORD--CAPTAIN FANNING\r\n\r\n\r\nEli Bickford, who was born on the 29th of September, 1754, in the town\r\nof Durham, N. H., and enlisted on a privateer, was taken prisoner by\r\nthe British, confined at first on the Old Jersey, and afterwards sent\r\nto England with many others, in a vessel commanded by Captain Smallcorn,\r\nwhom he called “a sample of the smallest corn he had ever met.” While\r\non board this vessel he was taken down with the smallpox. No beds or\r\nbedding were provided for the prisoners and a plank on deck was his only\r\npillow. He and his fellow sufferers were treated with great severity,\r\nand insulted at every turn. When they reached England they were sent to\r\nprison, where he remained in close confinement for four years and six\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nFinding a piece of a door hinge, he and some of the others endeavored\r\nto make their escape by digging a passage under the walls. A report of\r\ntheir proceedings reached the jailer, but, secure in the strength of\r\nthe walls he did not believe it. This jailor would frequently jest with\r\nBickford on the subject, asking him when he intended to make his escape.\r\nHis answers were so truthful and accurate that they served to blind the\r\njailor still further. One morning as this official entered the prison he\r\nsaid: “Well, Bickford, how soon will you be ready to go out?”\r\n\r\n“Tomorrow night!” answered Bickford.\r\n\r\n“O, that’s only some of your nonsense,” he replied.\r\n\r\nHowever, it was true.\r\n\r\nAfter digging a passage for some days underground, the prisoners found\r\nthemselves under an adjoining house. They proceeded to take up the brick\r\nfloor, unlocked the door and passed out, without disturbing the inmates,\r\nwho were all asleep. Unable to escape they concealed themselves for\r\nawhile, and then tamely gave themselves up. Such a vigilant watch was\r\nkept upon the house after they were missed from the prison, that they\r\nhad no other choice. So they made a contract with a man who was to\r\nreturn them to the prison, and then give them half of the reward of\r\nforty shillings which was offered for their re-capture. So successful\r\nwas this expedient that it was often put into operation when they needed\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nAs a punishment for endeavoring to escape they were confined in the\r\nBlack Hole for a week on bread and water.\r\n\r\nBickford describes the prison regulations for preserving order which\r\nwere made and carried out by the prisoners themselves. If a difficulty\r\narose between two of them it was settled in the following manner. The\r\nprisoners formed a circle in the centre of which the disputants took\r\ntheir stand, and exchanged a few rounds of well-directed blows, after\r\nwhich they shook hands, and were better friends than before.\r\n\r\nBickford was not released until peace was declared. He then returned to\r\nhis family, who had long thought him dead. It was on Sunday morning\r\nthat he reached his native town. As he passed the meeting house he was\r\nrecognized, and the whole congregation ran out to see and greet him.\r\n\r\nHe had but seven dollars as his whole capital when he married. He moved\r\nto Vermont, where he farmed a small place, and succeeded in making a\r\ncomfortable livelihood. He attained the great age of 101, and was one of\r\nthe last surviving prisoners of the Revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ADVENTURES OF A NAVAL OFFICER\r\n\r\nIn the year 1806 a little book with this title was published in New\r\nYork, by Captain Nathaniel Fanning. It was dedicated to John Jackson,\r\nEsquire, the man who did so much to interest the public in the\r\npreservation and interment of the remains of the martyrs of the\r\nprisonships in the Wallabout.\r\n\r\nFanning was born in Connecticut, in the year 1755. On the 26th of May,\r\n1778, he went on board the brig Angelica, commanded by Captain William\r\nDennis, which was about to sail on a six months cruise. There were 98\r\nmen and boys in the crew, and Fanning was prize-master on board the\r\nprivateer. She was captured by the Andromeda, a frigate of 28 guns, five\r\ndays from Philadelphia, with General Howe on board on his way back to\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nAll the prisoners were paraded on deck and asked if they were willing\r\nto engage in his British Majesty’s service. Nearly all answered in the\r\nnegative. They were then told that they were “a set of rebels,” and that\r\nit was more than probable that they would all be hung at Portsmouth.\r\n\r\nTheir baggage was then taken away, and they were confined in the hold\r\nof the ship. Their clothes were stolen by the sailors, and a frock and\r\ncheap trousers dealt out to each man in their place.\r\n\r\nThe heat was intolerable in the hold, although they went naked. In this\r\ncondition they plotted to seize the vessel, and procured some weapons\r\nthrough the agency of their surgeon. Spencer, the captain’s clerk,\r\nbetrayed them to the captain of the Andromeda, and, after that, the\r\nhatches were barred down, and they began to think that they would all\r\ndie of suffocation. The sentence pronounced upon them was that they\r\nshould be allowed only half a pint of water a day for each man, and\r\nbarely food enough to sustain life.\r\n\r\nTheir condition would have been terrible, but, fortunately for them,\r\nthey were lodged upon the water casks, over which was constructed a\r\ntemporary deck. By boring holes in the planks they managed, by means of\r\na proof glass, to obtain all the water they needed.\r\n\r\nBetween them and the general’s store room was nothing but a partition of\r\nplank. They went to work to make an aperture through which a man could\r\npass into this store room. A young man named Howard from Rhode Island\r\nwas their instigator in all these operations. They discovered that one\r\nof the shifting boards abaft the pump room was loose, and that they\r\ncould ship and unship it as they pleased. When it was unshipped there\r\nwas just room for a man to crawl into the store room. “Howard first went\r\nin,” writes Captain Fanning, “and presently desired me to hand him a\r\nmug or can with a proof glass. A few minutes after he handed me back the\r\nsame full, saying ‘My friends, as good Madeira wine as ever was drank at\r\nthe table of an Emperor!’\r\n\r\n“I took it from his hands and drank about half a pint.\r\n\r\n“Thus we lived like hearty fellows, taking care every night to secure\r\nprovisions, dried fruit, and wines for the day following * * * and all\r\nwithout our enemies’ knowledge.”\r\n\r\nScurvy broke out among the crew, and some of the British sailors died,\r\nbut the Americans were all “brave and hearty.”\r\n\r\n“The Captain would say, ‘What! are none of them damned Yankees sick?\r\nDamn them, there’s nothing but thunder and lightning will kill ‘em.’”\r\n On the thirtieth of June the vessel arrived at Portsmouth. The prisoners\r\nwere sent to Hazel hospital, to be examined by the Commissioners of the\r\nAdmiralty, and then marched to Forton prison, where they were committed\r\nunder the charges of piracy and high treason. This prison was about two\r\nmiles from Portsmouth harbor, and consisted of two commodious buildings,\r\nwith a yard between them large enough to parade a guard of 100 men,\r\nwhich was the number required to maintain law and order at the station.\r\n\r\nThey also had a spacious lot of about three quarters of an acre in\r\nextent, adjoining the houses, in which they took their daily exercise.\r\nIn the middle of this lot was a shed with seats. It was open on all\r\nsides. The lot was surrounded by a wall of iron pickets, eight feet in\r\nheight. The agent for American prisoners was nicknamed by them “the old\r\ncrab.” He was very old and ugly.\r\n\r\nOnly three-fourths of the usual allowance to prisoners of war was dealt\r\nout to them, and they seem to have fared much worse than the inmates of\r\nthe Old Mill Prison at Plymouth.\r\n\r\nCaptain Fanning declares that they were half starved, and would\r\nsometimes beg bones from the people who came to look at them. When they\r\nobtained bones they would dig out the marrow, and devour it. The guard\r\nwas cruel and spiteful. One day they heated some pokers red hot and\r\nbegan to burn the prisoners’ shirts that were hung up to dry. These men\r\nbegged the guard, in a very civil manner, not to burn all their shirts,\r\nas they had only one apiece. This remonstrance producing no effect they\r\nthen ran to the pickets and snatched away their shirts. At this the\r\nofficer on command ordered a sentinel to fire on them. This he did,\r\nkilling one prisoner, and wounding several. There were three hundred\r\nAmerican prisoners in the yard at this time.\r\n\r\nThese prisons appear to have been very imperfectly guarded, and the\r\nregular occupation of the captives, whenever their guards were asleep\r\nor absent, was to make excavations for the purpose of escaping. A\r\ngreat many regained their freedom in this manner, though some were\r\noccasionally brought back and punished by being shut up for forty days\r\nin the Black Hole on bread and water. Some, less fortunate, remained\r\nthree or four years in the prison.\r\n\r\nThere was always digging going on in some part of the prison and as soon\r\nas one hole was discovered and plastered up, another would be begun.\r\nFor a long time they concealed the dirt that they took out of these\r\nexcavations in an old stack of disused chimneys. The hours for\r\nperforming the work were between eleven and three o’clock at night.\r\nEarly in the morning they ceased from their labors, concealing the hole\r\nthey had made by pasting white paper over it.\r\n\r\nThere was a school kept constantly in the prison, where many of them had\r\nthe first opportunity that had ever been granted them of receiving an\r\neducation. Many learned to read and write, and became proficient in\r\nFrench.\r\n\r\nAt one time there were 367 officers confined in this place. In the\r\ncourse of twelve months 138 of them escaped and got safely to France.\r\nWhile some of the men were digging at night, others would be dancing\r\nto drown the noise. They had several violins, and seem to have been a\r\nreckless and jovial set.\r\n\r\nThe officers bunked on the second floor over the guard room of the\r\nEnglish officers. At times they would make so much noise that the guard\r\nwould rush up the stairs, only to find all lights out and every man\r\n_asleep and snoring_ in his hammock. They would relieve their feelings\r\nby a volley of abusive language and go down stairs again, when instantly\r\nthe whole company would be on their feet, the violins would strike up,\r\nand the fun be more fast and furious than ever. These rushes of the\r\nguard would sometimes be repeated several times a night, when they would\r\nalways find the prisoners in their hammocks. Each hammock had what was\r\ncalled a “king’s rug,” a straw bed, and pillow.\r\n\r\nAt one time several men were suddenly taken sick, with strong symptoms\r\nof poison. They were removed to the hospital, and for a time, there was\r\ngreat alarm. The prisoners feared that “the same game was playing here\r\nas had been done on the Old Jersey, where we had heard that thousands of\r\nour countrymen had died.” The poison employed in this instance was glass\r\npounded fine and cooked with their bread.\r\n\r\nAn English clergyman named Wren sympathized strongly with the prisoners\r\nand assisted them to escape. He lived at Gosport, and if any of the\r\ncaptives were so fortunate as to dig themselves out and succeed in\r\nreaching his house, they were safe. This good man begged money and food\r\nfor “his children,” as he called them.\r\n\r\nOn the second of June, 1779, 120 of them were exchanged. There were then\r\n600 confined in that prison. On the 6th of June they sailed for Nantes\r\nin France. The French treated them with great kindness, made up a purse\r\nfor them, and gave them decent clothing.\r\n\r\nFanning next went to L’Orient, and there met John Paul Jones, who\r\ninvited him to go on board the Bon Homme Richard as a midshipman. They\r\nsailed on the 14th of August on the memorable expedition to the British\r\nChannel.\r\n\r\nAfter being with Jones for some time Fanning, on the 23rd of March,\r\n1781, sailed for home in a privateer from Morlaix, France. This\r\nprivateer was captured by the English frigate, Aurora.\r\n\r\n“Captain Anthon and myself and crew,” writes Mr. Fanning, “were all\r\nordered to a prison at about two miles from Falmouth. The very dirtiest\r\nand most loathsome building I ever saw. Swarms of lice, remarkably fat\r\nand full grown; bed bugs, and fleas. I believe the former were of Dutch\r\nextraction, as there were confined here a number of Dutch prisoners of\r\nwar, and such a company of dirty fellows I never saw before or since.”\r\n\r\nYet these same poor fellows ceded to Captain Anthon and Mr. Fanning a\r\ncorner of the prison for their private use. This they managed to get\r\nthoroughly cleansed, screened themselves off with some sheets, provided\r\nthemselves with large swinging cots, and were tolerably comfortable.\r\nThey were paroled and allowed full liberty within bounds, which were a\r\nmile and a half from the prison. In about six weeks Fanning was again\r\nexchanged, and went to Cherbourg in France, where he met Captain Manly,\r\nwho had just escaped from the Mill prison after three years confinment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nSOME SOUTHERN NAVAL PRISONERS\r\n\r\n\r\nVery little is known of the State navies of the south during the\r\nRevolution. Each State had her own small navy, and many were the\r\ninteresting adventures, some successful, and others unfortunate, that\r\nthe hardy sailors encountered. The story of each one of these little\r\nvessels would be as interesting as a romance, but we are here only\r\nconcerned with the meagre accounts that have reached us of the\r\nsufferings of some of the crews of the privateers who were so unlucky as\r\nto fall into the hands of the enemy.\r\n\r\nIn the infant navy of Virginia were many small, extremely fleet\r\nvessels. The names of some of the Virginia ships, built at Gosport,\r\nFredericksburg, and other Virginia towns, were the Tartar, Oxford,\r\nThetis, Virginia, Industry, Cormorant, Loyalist (which appears to\r\nhave been captured from the British), Pocohontas, Dragon, Washington,\r\nTempest, Defiance, Oliver Cromwell, Renown, Apollo, and the Marquis\r\nLafayette. Virginia also owned a prisonship called the Gloucester. Brigs\r\nand brigantines owned by the State were called the Raleigh, Jefferson,\r\nSallie Norton, Northampton, Hampton, Greyhound, Dolphin, Liberty,\r\nMosquito, Rochester, Willing Lass, Wilkes, American Fabius, Morning\r\nStar, and Mars. Schooners were the Adventure, Hornet, Speedwell, Lewis,\r\nNicholson, Experiment, Harrison, Mayflower, Revenge, Peace and Plenty,\r\nPatriot, Liberty, and the Betsy. Sloops were the Virginia, Rattlesnake,\r\nScorpion, Congress, Liberty, Eminence, Game-Cock, and the American\r\nCongress. Some of the galleys were the Accomac, Diligence, Hero,\r\nGloucester, Safeguard, Manly, Henry, Norfolk, Revenge, Caswell,\r\nProtector, Washington, Page, Lewis, Dragon, and Dasher. There were\r\ntwo armed pilot boats named Molly and Fly. Barges were the York and\r\nRichmond. The Oxford, Cormorant, and Loyalist were prizes. The two\r\nlatter were taken from the English by the French and sold to Virginia.\r\n\r\nWhat an interesting book might be written about this little navy! Nearly\r\nall were destined to fall at last into the hands of the enemy; their\r\ncrews to languish out the remainder of their days in foul dungeons,\r\nwhere famine and disease made short work of them. Little remains to us\r\nnow except the names of these vessels.\r\n\r\nThe Virginia was built at Gosport. The Dragon and some others were built\r\nat Fredericksburg. Many were built at Norfolk.\r\n\r\nThe Hermit was early captured by the British. The gallant little\r\nMosquito was taken by the Ariadne. Her crew was confined in a loathsome\r\njail at Barbadoes. But her officers were sent to England, and confined\r\nin Fortune jail at Gosport. They succeeded in escaping and made their\r\nway to France. The names of these officers were Captain John Harris;\r\nLieutenant Chamberlayne; Midshipman Alexander Moore; Alexander Dock,\r\nCaptain of Marines; and George Catlett, Lieutenant of Marines.\r\n\r\nThe Raleigh was captured by the British frigate Thames. Her crew was so\r\nshamefully maltreated that upon representations made to the Council\r\nof State upon their condition, it was recommended that by way of\r\nretaliation the crew of the Solebay, a sloop of war which had fallen\r\ninto the hands of the Americans, should be visited with the like severe\r\ntreatment. To what extent this was carried out we cannot discover.\r\n\r\nThe Scorpion was taken by the British in the year 1781, a fatal year for\r\nthe navy of Virginia.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1857 an unsigned article on the subject of the Virginia Navy\r\nwas published in the _Southern Literary Messenger_, which goes on to\r\nsay: “But of all the sufferings in these troublous times none endured\r\nsuch horrors as did those Americans who were so unfortunate as to become\r\nprisoners of war to the British. They were treated more as felons than\r\nas honorable enemies. It can scarcely be credited that an enlightened\r\npeople would thus have been so lost to the common instincts of humanity,\r\nas were they in their conduct towards men of the same blood, and\r\nspeaking the same language with themselves. True it is they sometimes\r\nexcused the cruelty of their procedures by avowing in many instances\r\ntheir prisoners were deserters from the English flag, and were to be\r\ndealt with accordingly. Be this as it may, no instance is on record\r\nwhere a Tory whom the Americans had good cause to regard as a traitor,\r\nwas visited with the severities which characterized the treatment of the\r\nordinary military captives, on the part of the English authorities. *\r\n* * The patriotic seamen of the Virginia navy were no exceptions to the\r\nrule when they fell into the hands of the more powerful lords of the\r\nocean. They were carried in numbers to Bermuda, and to the West Indies,\r\nand cast into loathsome and pestilential prisons, from which a few\r\nsometimes managed to escape, at the peril of their lives. Respect\r\nof position and rank found no favor in the eyes of their ungenerous\r\ncaptors, and no appeal could reach their hearts except through the\r\npromises of bribes. Many languished and died in those places, away from\r\ncountry and friends, whose fate was not known until long after they had\r\npassed away. But it was not altogether abroad that they were so cruelly\r\nmaltreated. The record of their sufferings in the prisons of the\r\nenemy, in our own country, is left to testify against these relentless\r\npersecutors.\r\n\r\n“In New York and Halifax many of the Virginian officers and seamen were\r\nrelieved of their pains, alone by the hand of death; and in their own\r\nState, at Portsmouth, the like fate overtook many more, who had endured\r\nhorrors rivalled only by the terrors of the Black Hole of Calcutta. *\r\n* * The reader will agree that we do not exaggerate when he shall have\r\nseen the case as given under oath by one who was in every respect a\r\ncompetent witness.\r\n\r\n“It will be remembered that, in another part of this narrative, mention\r\nwas made of the loss in Lynhaven Bay of the galley Dasher, and the\r\ncapture of the officers and the crew. Captain Willis Wilson was her\r\nunfortunate commander on that occasion. He and his men were confined in\r\nthe Provost Jail at Portsmouth, Virginia, and after his release he\r\nmade public the ‘secrets’ of that ‘Prison House,’ by the following\r\ndeposition, which is copied from the original document.\r\n\r\n“‘The deposition of Willis Wilson, being first sworn deposes and sayeth:\r\nThat about the 23rd July last the deponent was taken a prisoner of war;\r\nwas conducted to Portsmouth (Virginia) after having been plundered of\r\nall his clothing, etc., and there lodged with about 190 other prisoners,\r\nin the Provost. This deponent during twenty odd days was a spectator to\r\nthe most savage cruelty with which the unhappy prisoners were treated\r\nby the English. The deponent has every reason to believe there was\r\na premeditated scheme to infect all the prisoners who had not been\r\ninfected with the smallpox. There were upwards of 100 prisoners\r\nwho never had the disorder, notwithstanding which negroes, with the\r\ninfection upon them, were lodged under the same roof of the Provost.\r\nOthers were sent in to attend upon the prisoners, with the scabs of that\r\ndisorder upon them.\r\n\r\n“‘Some of the prisoners soon caught the disorder, others were down with\r\nthe flux, and some from fevers. From such a complication of disorders\r\n‘twas thought expedient to petition General O’Hara who was then\r\ncommanding officer, for a removal of the sick, or those who were not, as\r\nyet, infected with the smallpox. Accordingly a petition was sent by Dr.\r\nSmith who shortly returned with a verbal answer, as he said, from the\r\nGeneral. He said the General desired him to inform the prisoners that\r\nthe _law of nations was annihilated_, that he had nothing then to bind\r\nthem but bolts and bars, and they were to continue where they were, but\r\nthat they were free agents to inoculate if they chose.\r\n\r\n“‘About thirty agreed with the same Smith to inoculate them at a guinea\r\na man; he performed the operation, received his guinea from many, and\r\nthen left them to shift for themselves, though he had agreed to attend\r\nthem through the disorder. Many of them, as well as those who took it\r\nin the natural way, died. Colonel Gee, with many respectable characters,\r\nfell victims to the unrelenting cruelty of O’Hara, who would admit of no\r\ndiscrimination between the officers, privates, negroes, and felons; but\r\npromiscuously confined the whole in one house. * * * They also suffered\r\noften from want of water, and such as they got was very muddy and unfit\r\nto drink.\r\n\r\n“‘Willis Wilson.\r\n\r\n“‘This day came before me Captain Willis Wilson and made oath that the\r\nabove is true.\r\n\r\n“‘Samuel Thorogood.’”\r\n\r\nThere is much of great interest in this article on the Virginia Navy\r\nwhich is not to our present purpose. The writer goes on to tell how, on\r\none occasion, the ship Favorite, bearing a flag of truce, was returning\r\nto Virginia, with a number of Americans who had just been liberated or\r\nexchanged in Bermuda, when she was overhauled by a British man-of-war,\r\nand both her crew and passengers robbed of all they had. The British\r\nships which committed this dastardly deed were the Tiger, of 14 guns,\r\nand the schooner Surprise, of 10 guns.\r\n\r\nCaptain James Barron, afterwards Commodore Barren, was the master\r\nspirit of the service in Virginia. One of the Virginian vessels, very\r\nappropriately named the Victory, was commanded by him, and was never\r\ndefeated.\r\n\r\nIn 1781 Joseph Galloway wrote a letter to Lord Howe in which he says:\r\n“The rebel navy has been in a great measure destroyed by the small\r\nBritish force remaining in America, and the privateers sent out from\r\nNew York. Their navy, which consisted, at the time of your departure,\r\nof about thirty vessels, is now reduced to eight, and the number of\r\nprivateers fitted out in New England amounting to an hundred and upwards\r\nis now less than forty.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nEXTRACTS FROM NEWSPAPERS--SOME OF THE PRISON SHIPS--CASE OF CAPTAIN\r\nBIRDSALL\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the risk of repetition of some facts that have already been given, we\r\nmust again refer the reader to some extracts from the newspapers of the\r\nday. In this instance the truth can best be established by the mouths of\r\nmany witnesses, and we do not hesitate to give the English side whenever\r\nwe have been able to discover anything bearing on the subject in the\r\nso-called loyal periodicals of the time.\r\n\r\nFrom Freeman’s _Journal,_ date of Jan. 19th, 1777, we take the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n“General Howe has discharged all the privates who were prisoners in New\r\nYork. Half he sent to the world of spirits for want of food: the others\r\nhe hath sent to warn their countrymen of the danger of falling into\r\nhis hands, and to convince them by ocular demonstration, that it is\r\ninfinitely better to be slain in battle, than to be taken prisoner by\r\nBritish brutes, whose tender mercies are cruelties.”\r\n\r\nIn the _Connecticut Journal_ of Jan. 30th, 1777, is the following:\r\n\r\n“This account of the sufferings of these unfortunate men was obtained\r\nfrom the prisoners themselves. As soon as they were taken they were\r\nrobbed of all their baggage; of whatever money they had, though it were\r\nof paper; of their silver shoe buckles and knee buckles, etc.; and many\r\nwere stripped almost of their clothes. Especially those who had good\r\nclothes were stripped at once, being told that such were ‘too good for\r\nrebels.’\r\n\r\n“Thus deprived of their clothes and baggage, they were unable to shift\r\neven their linen, and were obliged to wear the same shirts for even\r\nthree or four months together, whereby they became extremely nasty; and\r\nthis of itself was sufficient to bring on them many mortal diseases.\r\n\r\n“After they were taken they were in the first place put on board the\r\nships, and thrust down into the hold, where not a breath of fresh air\r\ncould be obtained, and they were nearly suffocated for want of air.\r\n\r\n“Some who were taken at Fort Washington were first in this manner thrust\r\ndown into the holds of vessels in such numbers that even in the cold\r\nseason of November they could scarcely bear any clothes on them, being\r\nkept in a constant sweat. Yet these same persons, after lying in this\r\nsituation awhile, till the pores of their bodies were as perfectly\r\nopen as possible, were of a sudden taken out and put into some of the\r\nchurches of New York, without covering, or a spark of fire, where they\r\nsuffered as much by the cold as they did by the sweating stagnation of\r\nthe air in the other situation; and the consequence was that they took\r\nsuch colds as brought on the most fatal diseases, and swept them off\r\nalmost beyond conception.\r\n\r\n“Besides these things they suffered severely for want of provisions.\r\nThe commissioners pretended to allow a half a pound of bread, and four\r\nounces of pork per day; but of this pittance they were much cut short.\r\nWhat was given them for three days was not enough for one day and, in\r\nsome instances, they went for three days without a single mouthful of\r\nfood of any kind. They were pinched to such an extent that some on board\r\nthe ships would pick up and eat the salt that happened to be scattered\r\nthere; others gathered up the bran which the light horse wasted, and eat\r\nit, mixed with dirt and filth as it was.\r\n\r\n“Nor was this all, both the bread and pork which they did allow them was\r\nextremely bad. For the bread, some of it was made out of the bran which\r\nthey brought over to feed their light horse, and the rest of it was so\r\nmuddy, and the pork so damnified, being so soaked in bilge water during\r\nthe transportation from Europe, that they were not fit to be eaten by\r\nhuman creatures, and when they were eaten were very unwholesome. Such\r\nbread and pork as they would not pretend to give to their own countrymen\r\nthey gave to our poor sick dying prisoners.\r\n\r\n“Nor were they in this doleful condition allowed a sufficiency of water.\r\nOne would have thought that water was so cheap and plentiful an element,\r\nthat they would not have grudged them that. But there are, it seems,\r\nno bounds to their cruelty. The water allowed them was so brackish, and\r\nwithal nasty, that they could not drink it until reduced to extremity.\r\nNor did they let them have a sufficiency of even such water as this.\r\n\r\n“When winter came on, our people suffered extremely for want of fire and\r\nclothes to keep them warm. They were confined in churches where there\r\nwere no fireplaces that they could make fires, even if they had wood.\r\nBut wood was only allowed them for cooking their pittance of victuals;\r\nand for that purpose very sparingly. They had none to keep them warm\r\neven in the extremest of weather, although they were almost naked,\r\nand the few clothes they had were their summer clothes. Nor had they\r\na single blanket, nor any bedding, not even straw allowed them until a\r\nlittle before Christmas.\r\n\r\n“At the time those were taken on Long Island a considerable part of them\r\nwere sick of the dysentery; and with this distemper on them were first\r\ncrowded on board the ships, afterwards in the churches in New York,\r\nthree, four or five hundred together, without any blankets, or anything\r\nfor even the sick to lie upon, but the bare floors or pavements.\r\n\r\n“In this situation that contagious distemper soon communicated from the\r\nsick to the well, who would probably have remained so, had they not in\r\nthis manner been thrust in together without regard to sick or well, or\r\nto the sultry, unwholesome season, it being then the heat of summer. Of\r\nthis distemper numbers died daily, and many others by their confinement\r\nand the sultry season contracted fevers and died of them. During their\r\nsickness, with these and other diseases, they had no medicines, nothing\r\nsoothing or comfortable for sick people, and were not so much as visited\r\nby the physician for months together.\r\n\r\n“Nor ought we to omit the insults which the humane Britons offered to\r\nour people, nor the artifices which they used to enlist them in their\r\nservice to fight against their country. It seems that one end of their\r\nstarving our people was to bring them, by dint of necessity, to turn\r\nrebels to their own country, their own consciences, and their God. For\r\nwhile thus famishing they would come and say to them: ‘This is the just\r\npunishment of your rebellion. Nay, you are treated too well for rebels;\r\nyou have not received half you deserve or half you shall receive. But if\r\nyou will enlist into his Majesty’s service, you shall have victuals and\r\nclothes enough.’\r\n\r\n“As to insults, the British officers, besides continually cursing and\r\nswearing at them as rebels, often threatened to hang them all; and, on a\r\nparticular time, ordered a number, each man to choose his halter out\r\nof a parcel offered, wherewith to be hanged; and even went so far as to\r\ncause a gallows to be erected before the prison, as if they were to be\r\nimmediately executed.\r\n\r\n“They further threatened to send them all into the East Indies, and sell\r\nthem there for slaves.\r\n\r\n“In these and numberless other ways did the British officers seem to\r\nrack their inventions to insult, terrify, and vex the poor prisoners.\r\nThe meanest, upstart officers among them would insult and abuse our\r\ncolonels and chief officers.\r\n\r\n“In this situation, without clothes, without victuals or drink, or even\r\nwater, or with those which were base and unwholesome; without fire, a\r\nnumber of them sick, first with a contagious and nauseous distemper;\r\nthese, with others, crowded by hundreds into close confinement, at the\r\nmost unwholesome season of the year, and continued there for four months\r\nwithout blankets, bedding, or straw; without linen to shift or clothes\r\nto cover their bodies;--No wonder they all became sickly, and having at\r\nthe same time no medicine, no help of physicians, nothing to refresh\r\nor support nature, died by scores in a night, and those who were so far\r\ngone as to be unable to help themselves lay uncared for, till death,\r\nmore kind than Britons, put an end to their misery.\r\n\r\n“By these means, and in this way, 1,500 brave Americans, who had nobly\r\ngone forth in defence of their injured, oppressed country, but whom the\r\nchance at war had cast into the hands of our enemies, died in New York,\r\nmany of whom were very amiable, promising youths, of good families, the\r\nvery flower of our land; and of those who lived to come out of prison,\r\nthe greater part, as far as I can learn, are dead or dying. Their\r\nconstitutions are broken; the stamina of nature worn out; they cannot\r\nrecover--they die. Even the few that might have survived are dying of\r\nthe smallpox. For it seems that our enemies determining that even these,\r\nwhom a good constitution and a kind Providence had carried through\r\nunexampled sufferings, should not at last escape death, just before\r\ntheir release from imprisonment infected them with that fatal distemper.\r\n\r\n“To these circumstances we subjoin the manner in which they buried those\r\nof our people who died. They dragged them out of the prison by one leg\r\nor one arm, piled them up without doors, there let them lie until a\r\nsufficient number were dead to make a cart load, then loaded them up in\r\na cart, drove the cart thus loaded out to the ditches made by our people\r\nwhen fortifying New York; there they would tip the cart, tumble the\r\ncorpses together into the ditch, and afterwards slightly cover them\r\nwith earth. * * * While our poor prisoners have been thus treated by our\r\nfoes, the prisoners we have taken have enjoyed the liberty of walking\r\nand riding about within large limits at their pleasure; have been freely\r\nsupplied with every necessary, and have even lived on the fat of the\r\nland. None have been so well fed, so plump, and so merry as they; and\r\nthis generous treatment, it is said, they could not but remember.\r\nFor when they were returned in the exchange of prisoners, and saw the\r\nmiserable, famished, dying state of our prisoners, conscious of the\r\ntreatment they had received, they could not refrain from tears.”\r\n _Connecticut Journal,_ Jan. 30th, 1777.\r\n\r\nIn April of the year 1777 a committee that was appointed by Congress\r\nto inquire into the doings of the British on their different marches\r\nthrough New York and New Jersey reported that “The prisoners, instead\r\nof that humane treatment which those taken by the United States\r\nexperienced, were in general treated with the greatest barbarity. Many\r\nof them were kept near four days without food altogether. * * * Freemen\r\nand men of substance suffered all that generous minds could suffer from\r\nthe contempt and mockery of British and foreign mercenaries. Multitudes\r\ndied in prison. When they were sent out several died in being carried\r\nfrom the boats on shore, or upon the road attempting to go home. The\r\ncommittee, in the course of their inquiry, learned that sometimes\r\nthe common soldiers expressed sympathy with the prisoners, and the\r\nforeigners (did this) more than the English. But this was seldom or\r\nnever the case with the officers, nor have they been able to hear of any\r\ncharitable assistance given them by the inhabitants who remained in,\r\nor resorted to the city of New York, which neglect, if universal, they\r\nbelieve was never known to happen in any similar case in a Christian\r\ncountry.”\r\n\r\nWe have already shown that some of the citizens of New York, even a\r\nnumber of the profligate women of the town, did their best to relieve\r\nthe wants of the perishing prisoners. But the guards were very strict,\r\nand what they could do was inadequate to remove the distresses under\r\nwhich these victims of cruelty and oppression died. As we are attempting\r\nto make this work a compendium of all the facts that can be gathered\r\nupon the subject, we must beg the reader’s indulgence if we continue to\r\ngive corroborating testimony of the same character, from the periodicals\r\nof the day. We will next quote from the _New Hampshire Gazette,_ date of\r\nFebruary 4th, 1779.\r\n\r\n“It is painful to repeat the indubitable accounts we are constantly\r\nreceiving, of the cruel and inhuman treatment of the subjects of these\r\nStates from the British in New York and other places. They who hear our\r\ncountrymen who have been so unfortunate as to fall into the hands of\r\nthose unrelenting tyrants, relate the sad story of their captivity, the\r\ninsults they have received, and the slow, cool, systematic manner in\r\nwhich great numbers of those who could not be prevailed on to enter\r\ntheir service have been murdered, must have hearts of stone not to\r\nmelt with pity for the sufferers, and burn with indignation at their\r\ntormentors. As we have daily fresh instances to prove the truth of such\r\na representation, public justice requires that repeated public mention\r\nshould be made of them. A cartel vessel lately arrived at New London in\r\nConnecticut, carrying about 130 American prisoners from the prison ships\r\nin New York. Such was the condition in which these poor creatures\r\nwere put on board the cartel, that in the short run, 16 died on board;\r\nupwards of sixty when they were landed, were scarcely able to move, and\r\nthe remainder greatly emaciated and enfeebled; and many who continue\r\nalive are never likely to recover their former health. The greatest\r\ninhumanity was experienced by the prisoners in a ship of which one\r\nNelson, a Scotchman, had the superintendence. Upwards of 300 American\r\nprisoners were confined at a time, on board this ship. There was but\r\none small fire-place allowed to cook the food of such a number. The\r\nallowance of the prisoners was, moreover, frequently delayed, insomuch\r\nthat, in the short days of November and December, it was not begun to be\r\ndelivered out until 11 o’clock in the forenoon so that the whole\r\ncould not be served until three. At sunset the fire was ordered to be\r\nquenched; no plea from the many sick, from their absolute necessity,\r\nthe shortness of the time or the smallness of the hearth, was allowed to\r\navail. The known consequence was that some had not their food dressed at\r\nall; many were obliged to eat it half raw. On board the ship no flour,\r\noatmeal, and things of like nature, suited to the condition of infirm\r\npeople, were allowed to the many sick, nothing but ship-bread, beef,\r\nand pork. This is the account given by a number of prisoners, who are\r\ncredible persons, and this is but a part of their sufferings; so that\r\nthe excuse made by the enemy that the prisoners were emaciated and\r\ndied by contagious sickness, which no one could prevent, is futile. It\r\nrequires no great sagacity to know that crowding people together without\r\nfresh air, and feeding, or rather starving them in such a manner as the\r\nprisoners have been, must unavoidably produce a contagion. Nor is it\r\na want of candor to suppose that many of our enemies saw with pleasure\r\nthis contagion, which might have been so easily prevented, among the\r\nprisoners who could not be persuaded to enter the service.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CASE OF CAPTAIN BIRDSALL\r\n\r\nSoon after the battle of Long Island Captain Birdsall, a Whig officer,\r\nmade a successful attempt to release an American vessel laden with\r\nflour for the army, which had been captured in the Sound by the British.\r\nCaptain Birdsall offered, if the undertaking was approved of by his\r\nsuperior officer, to superintend the enterprise himself. The proposal\r\nwas accepted, when Birdsall, with a few picked men, made the experiment,\r\nand succeeded in sending the vessel to her original destination. But he\r\nand one of his men fell into the hands of the enemy. He was sent to the\r\nProvost Jail under surveillance of “that monster in human shape, the\r\ninfamous Cunningham.” He requested the use of pen, ink, and paper, for\r\nthe purpose of acquainting his family of his situation. On being refused\r\nhe made a reply which drew from the keeper some opprobious epithets,\r\naccompanied by a thrust from his sword, which penetrated the shoulder of\r\nhis victim, and caused the blood to flow freely. Being locked up alone\r\nin a filthy apartment, and denied any assistance whatever, he was\r\nobliged to dress the wound with his own linen, and then to endure, in\r\nsolitude and misery, every indignity which the malice of the Provost\r\nMaster urged him to inflict upon a _damned rebel_, who, he declared,\r\nought to be hung. “After several months of confinement and starvation he\r\nwas exchanged.”\r\n\r\nTwo Whig gentlemen of Long Island were imprisoned in the Provost Prison\r\nsome time in the year 1777. Two English Quakers named Jacob Watson and\r\nRobert Murray at last procured their release. Their names were George\r\nTownsend and John Kirk. Kirk caught the smallpox while in prison. He was\r\nsent home in a covered wagon. His wife met him at the door, and tenderly\r\nnursed him through the disorder. He recovered in due time, but she and\r\nher infant daughter died of the malady. There were hundreds of such\r\ncases: indeed throughout the war contagion was carried into every part\r\nof the country by soldiers and former prisoners. In some instances the\r\nBritish were accused of selling inoculated clothing to the prisoners.\r\nLet us hope that some, at least, of these reports are unfounded.\r\n\r\nThe North Dutch Church was the last of the churches used as prisons\r\nto be torn down. As late as 1850 it was still standing, and marks of\r\nbayonet thrusts were plainly to be discerned upon its pillars. How many\r\nof the wretched sufferers were in this manner done to death we have no\r\nmeans of discovering, but it must have been easier to die in that manner\r\nthan to have endured the protracted agonies of death by starvation.\r\n\r\nJohn Pintard, who assisted his uncle, Lewis Pintard, Commissioner for\r\nAmerican prisoners in New York, thus wrote of their sufferings. It must\r\nbe remembered that the prisoners taken in 1776 died, for the most\r\npart, before our struggling nation was able to protect them, before\r\nCommissioners had been appointed, and when, in her feeble infancy, the\r\nRepublic was powerless to aid them.\r\n\r\n“The prisoners taken on Long Island and at Fort Washington, sick,\r\nwounded, and well, were all indiscriminately huddled together, by\r\nhundreds and thousands, large numbers of whom died by disease, and\r\nmany undoubtedly poisoned by inhuman attendants, for the sake of their\r\nwatches or silver buckles.”\r\n\r\nIt was on the 20th of January, 1777, that Washington proposed to\r\nMr. Lewis Pintard, a merchant of New York, that he should accept the\r\nposition as resident agent for American prisoners. In May of that year\r\nGeneral Parsons sent to Washington a plan for making a raid upon Long\r\nIsland, and bringing off the American officers, prisoners of war on\r\nparole. Washington, however, disapproved of the plan, and it was not\r\nexecuted.\r\n\r\nNo one sympathized with the unfortunate victims of British cruelty more\r\ndeeply than the Commander-in-chief. But he keenly felt the injustice\r\nof exchanging sound, healthy, British soldiers, for starved and dying\r\nwretches, for the most part unable even to reach their homes. In a\r\nletter written by him on the 28th of May, 1777, to General Howe, he\r\ndeclared that a great proportion of prisoners sent out by the British\r\nwere not fit subjects for exchange, and that, being made so unfit by the\r\nseverity of their treatment, a deduction should be made. It is needless\r\nto say that the British General refused this proposition.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of June, 1777, Washington, in a long letter to General Howe,\r\nstates that he gave clothing to the British prisoners in his care.\r\nHe also declares that he was not informed of the sufferings of the\r\nAmericans in New York until too late, and that he was refused permission\r\nto establish an agency in that city to purchase what was necessary to\r\nsupply the wants of the prisoners.\r\n\r\nIt was not until after the battle of Trenton that anything could be done\r\nto relieve these poor men. Washington, by his heroism, when he led his\r\nlittle band across the half frozen Delaware, saved the lives of the\r\nsmall remnant of prisoners in New York. After the battle he had so many\r\nBritish and Hessian prisoners in his power, that he was able to impress\r\nupon the British general the fact that American prisoners were too\r\nvaluable to be murdered outright, and that it was more expedient to keep\r\nthem alive for purposes of exchange.\r\n\r\nRivington’s _Gazette_ of Jan. 15th, 1779, contains this notice:\r\n“Privateers arriving in New York Harbor are to put their prisoners on\r\nboard the Good Hope or Prince of Wales prison ships.\r\n\r\n“James Dick.”\r\n\r\nIf the Jersey were in use at that time it must have been too crowded\r\nfor further occupancy. But although there is frequent mention in the\r\nperiodicals of the day of the prison ships of New York the Jersey did\r\nnot become notorious until later.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of June, 1779, Sir George Collier, in a notice in\r\nRivington’s _Gazette_, forbids “privateers landing prisoners on Long\r\nIsland to the damage and annoyance of His Majesty’s faithful servants.”\r\n\r\nThis order was no doubt issued, in fear of contagion, which fear led\r\nthe British to remove their prison ships out of New York Harbor to the\r\nretired waters of Wallabout Bay, where the work of destruction could go\r\non with less fear of producing a general pestilence.\r\n\r\nIn the issue for the 23rd of August, 1779, we read: “To be sold, The\r\nsails and rigging of the ship Good Hope. Masts, spars, and yards as good\r\nas new.”\r\n\r\nAmong the accounts of cruelty to the prisoners it is refreshing to come\r\nupon such a paragraph as this, from a New London, Conn. paper, dated\r\nAugust 18th, 1779. “Last week five or six hundred American prisoners\r\nwere exchanged. A flag returned here with 47 American prisoners, and\r\nthough taken out of the Good Hope prison ship, it must (for once) be\r\nacknowledged that all were very well and healthy. Only 150 left.”\r\n\r\nThe next quotation that we will give contains one of the first mentions\r\nof the Jersey as a prison ship, that we have been able to find.\r\n\r\n“New London, Sept. 1st, 1779. D. Stanton testifies that he was taken\r\nJune 5th and put in the Jersey prison ship. An allowance from Congress\r\nwas sent on board. About three or four weeks past we were removed on\r\nboard the Good Hope, where we found many sick. There is now a hospital\r\nship provided, to which they are removed, and good attention paid.”\r\n\r\nA Boston paper dated September 2nd, 1779, has the following: “Returned\r\nto this port Alexander Dickey, Commissary of Prisoners, from New\r\nYork, with a cartel, having on board 180 American prisoners. Their\r\ncountenances indicate that they have undergone every conceivable\r\ninhumanity.”\r\n\r\n“New London, Sep. 29th 1779. A Flag arrived here from New York with 117\r\nprisoners, chiefly from New England.”\r\n\r\nFrom Rivington’s _Gazette,_ March lst, 1780. “Last Saturday afternoon\r\nthe Good Hope prison ship, lying in the Wallebocht Bay was entirely\r\nconsumed after having been wilfully set on fire by a Connecticut\r\nman named Woodbury, who confessed to the fact. He with others of the\r\nincendiaries are removed to the Provost. The prisoners let each other\r\ndown from the port holes and decks into the water.”\r\n\r\nSo that was the end of the Good Hope. She seems to have been burned\r\nby some of the prisoners in utter desperation, probably with some hope\r\nthat, in the confusion, they might be enabled to escape, though we do\r\nnot learn that any of them were so fortunate, and the only consequence\r\nof the deed appears to have been that the remaining ships were crowded\r\nto suffocation.\r\n\r\nA writer in the Connecticut _Gazette,_ whose name is not given, says:\r\n“May 25th, 1780. I am now a prisoner on board the Falmouth, a place the\r\nmost dreadful; we are confined so that we have not room even to lie down\r\nall at once to sleep. It is the most horrible, cursed, hole that can\r\nbe thought of. I was sick and longed for some small beer, while I lay\r\nunpitied at death’s door, with a putrid fever, and though I had money I\r\nwas not permitted to send for it. I offered repeatedly a hard dollar for\r\na pint. The wretch who went forward and backward would not oblige me. I\r\nam just able to creep about. Four prisoners have escaped from this ship.\r\nOne having, as by accident, thrown his hat overboard, begged leave to\r\ngo after it in a small boat, which lay alongside. Having reached the hat\r\nthey secured the sentinel and made for the Jersey shore, though several\r\narmed boats pursued, and shot was fired from the shipping.”\r\n\r\nThe New Jersey _Gazette_ of June 4th, 1780, says: “Thirty-five\r\nAmericans, including five officers, made their escape from the prison\r\nship at New York and got safely off.”\r\n\r\n“For Sale. The remains of the hospital ship Kitty, as they now lie at\r\nthe Wallebocht, with launch, anchors, and cables.” Gaine’s _Mercury_,\r\nJuly 1st, 1780.\r\n\r\nNew Jersey _Gazette_, August 23, 1780. “Captain Grumet, who made his\r\nescape from the Scorpion prison ship, at New York, on the evening of\r\nthe 15th, says more lenity is shown the prisoners. There are 200 in the\r\nStrombolo, and 120 in the Scorpion.”\r\n\r\nIt was in 1780 that the poet Freneau was a prisoner on the Scorpion,\r\nwhich, at that time, was anchored in the East River. In Rivington’s\r\n_Gazette_, at the end of that year, the “hulks of his Majesty’s sloops\r\nScorpion and Hunter” are advertised for sale. Also “the Strombolo\r\nfire-ship, now lying in North River.” It appears, however, that there\r\nwere no purchasers, and they remained unsold. They were still in use\r\nuntil the end of the year 1781. Gaine’s _Mercury_ declares that “the\r\nStrombolo, from August 21st to December 10th, 1781, had never less than\r\n150 prisoners on board, oftener over 200.”\r\n\r\n“Captain Cahoon with four others escaped from a prison ship to Long\r\nIsland in a boat, March 8, notwithstanding they were fired on from the\r\nprison and hospital ships, and pursued by guard boats from three in the\r\nafternoon to seven in the evening. He left 200 prisoners in New York.”\r\n _Connecticut Journal_, March 22, 1781.\r\n\r\nThe _Connecticut Gazette_, in May, 1781, stated that 1100 French and\r\nAmerican prisoners had died during the winter in the prison ships. “New\r\nLondon, November 17th, 1781. A Flag of truce returned here from New York\r\nwith 132 prisoners, with the rest of those carried off by Arnold. They\r\nare chiefly from the prison ships, and some from the Sugar House, and\r\nare mostly sick.”\r\n\r\n“New London, Jan. 4th, 1782. 130 prisoners landed here from New York\r\nDecember third, in most deplorable condition. A great part are since\r\ndead, and the survivors so debilitated that they will drag out a\r\nmiserable existence. It is enough to melt the most obdurate heart to see\r\nthese miserable objects landed at our wharves sick and dying, and the\r\nfew rags they have on covered with vermin and their own excrements.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nTHE JOURNAL OF DR. ELIAS CORNELIUS--BRITISH PRISONS IN THE SOUTH\r\n\r\n\r\nWe must now conduct our readers back to the Provost Prison in New York,\r\nwhere, for some time, Colonel Ethan Allen was incarcerated. Dr. Elias\r\nCornelius, a surgeon’s mate, was taken prisoner by the British on the\r\n22nd of August, 1777. On that day he had ridden to the enemy’s advanced\r\npost to make observations, voluntarily accompanying a scouting party. On\r\nhis way back he was surprised, over-powered, and captured by a party of\r\nBritish soldiers.\r\n\r\nThis was at East Chester. He seems to have lagged behind the rest of\r\nthe party, and thus describes the occurrence: “On riding into town (East\r\nChester) four men started from behind a shed and took me prisoner. They\r\nimmediately began robbing me of everything I had, horse and harness,\r\npistols, Great Coat, shoe-buckles, pocket book, which contained over\r\nthirty pounds, and other things. The leader of the guard abused me very\r\nmuch. * * * When we arrived at King’s Bridge I was put under the Provost\r\nGuard, with a man named Prichard and several other prisoners.” They were\r\nkept at the guard house there for some time, and regaled with mouldy\r\nbread, rum and water, and sour apples, which were thrown down for them\r\nto scramble for, as if they were so many pigs. They were at last marched\r\nto New York. Just before reaching that city they were carried before a\r\nHessian general to be “made a show of.” The Hessians mocked them, told\r\nthem they were all to be hung, and even went so far as to draw their\r\nswords across their throats. But a Hessian surgeon’s mate took pity on\r\nCornelius, and gave him a glass of wine.\r\n\r\nOn the march to New York in the hot summer afternoon they were not\r\nallowed to stop even for a drink of water. Cornelius was in a fainting\r\ncondition, when a poor woman, compassionating his sad plight, asked to\r\nbe allowed to give them some water. They were then about four miles from\r\nNew York. She ran into her house and brought out several pails of\r\nbeer, three or four loaves of bread, two or three pounds of cheese, and\r\nbesides all this, she gave money to some of the prisoners. Her name was\r\nMrs. Clemons. She was from Boston and kept a small store along the road\r\nto New York.\r\n\r\nCornelius says: “We marched till we come to the Bowery, three quarters\r\nof a mile from New York. * * * As we come into town, Hessians, Negroes,\r\nand children insulted, stoned, and abused us. * * * In this way we were\r\nled through half the streets as a show. * * * At last we were ordered to\r\nthe Sugar House, which formerly went by the name of Livingstone’s\r\nSugar House. Here one Walley, a Sergeant of the 20th Regiment of Irish\r\ntraitors in the British service, had the charge of the prisoners. This\r\nman was the most barbarous, cruel man that ever I saw. He drove us into\r\nthe yard like so many hogs. From there he ordered us into the Sugar\r\nHouse, which was the dirtiest and most disagreeable place that I ever\r\nsaw, and the water in the pump was not better than that in the docks.\r\nThe top of the house was open * * * to the weather, so that when it\r\nrained the water ran through every floor, and it was impossible for us\r\nto keep dry. Mr. Walley gave thirteen of us four pounds of mouldy bread\r\nand four pounds of poor Irish pork for four days. I asked Mr Walley if\r\nI was not to have my parole. He answered ‘No!’ When I asked for pen and\r\nink to write a few lines to my father, he struck me across the face with\r\na staff which I have seen him beat the prisoners.” (with)\r\n\r\nOn the next morning Cornelius was conveyed to the Provost Guard. “I was\r\nthen taken down to a Dungeon. The provost marshal was Sergeant\r\nKeith” (Cunningham appears to have been, at this time, murdering the\r\nunfortunate prisoners in his power at Philadelphia).\r\n\r\n“There was in this place a Captain Travis of Virginia, and Captain of\r\na sloop of war. There were also in this dismal place nine thieves,\r\nmurderers, etc. A Captain Chatham was taken sick with nervous fever.\r\nI requested the Sergeant to suffer me to send for some medicine, or I\r\nbelieved he might die, to which he replied he might die, and if he did\r\nhe would bury him.\r\n\r\n“All the provisions each man had was but two pounds meat and two pounds\r\nbread for a week, always one and sometimes both was not fit to eat. *\r\n* * I had no change of linen from the 25th of August to the 12th of\r\nSeptember.”\r\n\r\nIt seems that the father of Cornelius, who lived on Long Island, was an\r\nardent Tory. Cornelius asked Sergeant O’Keefe to be allowed to send\r\nto his father for money and clothing. But this was refused. “In this\r\nhideous place,” he continues, “I was kept until the 20th of September;\r\nwhen Sergeant Keath took Captains C., and Travis, and myself, and led us\r\nto the upper part of the prison, where were Ethan Allen, Major Williams,\r\nPaine and Wells and others. Major Williams belonged at Maryland and was\r\ntaken prisoner at Fort Washington. * * *\r\n\r\n“While at this place we were not allowed to speak to any friend, not\r\neven out of the window. I have frequently seen women beaten with canes\r\nand ram-rods who have come to the prisons’ windows to speak to their\r\nHusbands, Sons, or Brothers, and officers put in the dungeon just for\r\nasking for cold water.”\r\n\r\nDried peas were given out to the prisoners, without the means of cooking\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWhen Fort Montgomery was taken by the British the American officers who\r\nhad been in command at that post were brought to the Provost and\r\nput into two small rooms on the lower floor. Some of them were badly\r\nwounded, but no surgeon was allowed to dress their wounds. Cornelius\r\nasked permission to do so, but this was refused. “All of us in the\r\nupper prison,” he continues, “were sometimes allowed to go on top of the\r\nhouse. I took this opportunity to throw some Ointment and Lint down the\r\nchimney to the wounded in the lower rooms with directions how to use it.\r\nI knew only one of them--Lt. Col. Livingstone.”\r\n\r\nAt the time of Burgoyne’s surrender a rumor of the event reached the\r\nprisoners, and women passing along the street made signs to assure them\r\nthat that general was really a captive. Colonel Livingstone received a\r\nletter from his father giving an account of Burgoyne’s surrender. “Soon\r\nwe heard hollooing and other expressions of joy from him and others in\r\nthe (lower) rooms. * * * He put the letter up through a crack in\r\nthe floor for us to read. * * * The whole prison was filled with joy\r\ninexpressible. * * * From this time we were better treated, although\r\nthe provision was bad, but we drew rather larger quantities of it. Some\r\nbutter, and about a gill of rice and some cole were dealt out to us,\r\nwhich we never drew before.\r\n\r\n“About this time my father came to see me. I was called down to the\r\ngrates. My heart at first was troubled within me; I burst into tears,\r\nand did not speak for some minutes. I put my hand through the grates,\r\nand took my father’s and held it fast. The poor old gentleman shed many\r\ntears, and seemed much troubled to see me in so woeful a place. * * *\r\nHe asked me what I thought of myself now, and why I could not have been\r\nruled by him. * * * Soon the Provost Marshal came and said he could not\r\nallow my father to stay longer.\r\n\r\n“* * * Toward the latter part of December we had Continental bread and\r\nbeef sent us, and as much wood as we wished to burn. A friend gave me\r\nsome money which was very useful.\r\n\r\n“Jan. 9th, 1778. This day Mr. Walley came and took from the prison\r\nmyself and six others under guard to the Sugar House. * * * At this time\r\nmy health was bad, being troubled with the scurvy, and my prospects for\r\nthe winter were dark.”\r\n\r\nHe describes the Sugar House as a dreadful place of torment, and\r\nsays that thirty disorderly men were allowed to steal from the other\r\nprisoners the few comforts they possessed. They would even take the sick\r\nout of their beds, steal their bedding, and beat and kick the wretched\r\nsufferers. The articles thus procured they would sell to Mr. Walley (or\r\nWoolley) for rum.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of January Cornelius was sent to the hospital. The Brick\r\nMeeting House was used for the sick among the prisoners.\r\n\r\n“Here,” he continues, “I stayed until the 16th. I was not much better\r\nthan I was in the Sugar House, no medicine was given me, though I had a\r\ncough and a fever. The Surgeon wished me as soon as I got better to take\r\nthe care of the sick, provided I could get my parole.\r\n\r\n“Jan. 16th. On coming next morning he (the surgeon) said he could get\r\nmy parole. I was now determined to make my escape, though hardly able to\r\nundertake it. Just at dusk, having made the Sentinel intoxicated, I with\r\nothers, went out into the backyard to endeavor to escape over the fence.\r\nThe others being backward about going first, I climbed upon a tombstone\r\nand gave a spring, and went over safe, and then gave orders for the\r\nothers to do so also. A little Irish lad undertook to leap over, and\r\ncaught his clothes in the spikes on the wall, and made something of a\r\nnoise. The sentinel being aroused called out ‘Rouse!’ which is the same\r\nas to command the guards to turn out. They were soon out and surrounded\r\nthe prison. In the mean time I had made my way to St. Paul’s Church,\r\nwhich was the wrong way to get out of town.\r\n\r\n“The guards, expecting that I had gone towards North River, went in that\r\ndirection. On arriving at the Church I turned into the street to go by\r\nthe College and thus go out of town by the side of the river. Soon after\r\nI was out of town I heard the eight o’clock gun, which * * * was the\r\nsignal for the sentinels to hail every man that came by. I wished much\r\nto cross the river, but could not find any boat suitable. While going\r\nalong up the side of the river at 9 P.M., I was challenged by a sentinel\r\nwith the usual word (Burdon), upon which I answered nothing, and on\r\nbeing challenged the second time I answered ‘Friend.’ He bade me advance\r\nand give the countersign, upon which I fancied (pretended) I was drunk,\r\nand advanced in a staggering manner, and after falling to the ground he\r\nasked me where I was going. I told him ‘Home,’ but that I had got lost,\r\nand having been to New York had taken rather too much liquor, and become\r\nsomewhat intoxicated. He then asked me my name which I told him was\r\nMatthew Hoppen. Mr. Hoppen lived not far distant. I solicited him to\r\nput me in the right direction, but he told me I must not go until the\r\nSergeant of the guard dismissed me from him, unless I could give him the\r\ncountersign. I still entreated him to let me go. Soon he consented and\r\ndirected my course, which I thanked him for. Soon the moon arose and\r\nmade it very light, and there being snow on the ground, crusted over,\r\nand no wind, therefore a person walking could be heard a great distance.\r\n\r\n“At this time the tumor in my lungs broke, and being afraid to cough for\r\nfear of being heard, prevented me from relieving myself of the pus that\r\nwas lodged there.\r\n\r\n“I had now to cross lots that were cleared and covered with snow, the\r\nhouses being thick on the road which I was to cross, and for fear of\r\nbeing heard I lay myself flat on my stomach and crept along on the\r\nfrozen snow. When I come to the fence I climbed over, and walked down\r\nthe road, near a house where there was music and dancing. At this time\r\none of the guards came out. I immediately fell down upon my face. Soon\r\nthe man went into the house. I rose again, and crossed the fence into\r\nthe field, and proceeded towards the river. There being no trees or\r\nrocks to prevent my being seen, and not being able to walk without being\r\nheard, and the dogs beginning to bark, I lay myself down flat again, and\r\ncrept across the field, which took me half an hour. I at length reached\r\nthe river and walked by the side of it some distance, and saw a small\r\ncreek which ran up into the island, and by the side of it a small house,\r\nand two Sentinels one on each side of it. Not knowing what to do I crept\r\ninto a hole in the bank which led in between two rocks. Here I heard\r\nthem talk. I concluded to endeavor to go around the head of the creek,\r\nwhich was about half a mile, but on getting out of the hole I took\r\nhold of the limb of a tree which gave way, and made a great noise. The\r\nsentinel, on hearing it said, ‘Did you not hear a person on the creek?’\r\n\r\n“I waited some minutes and then went around the head of the creek and\r\ncame down the river on the other side to see if I could not find a boat\r\nto cross to Long Island. But on finding sentinels near by I retreated\r\na short distance back, and went up the river. I had not gone more than\r\nthirty rods when I saw another sentinel posted on the bank of the river\r\nwhere I must pass. * * * I stood some time thinking what course to\r\npursue, but on looking at the man found he did not move and was leaning\r\non his gun. I succeeded in passing by without waking him up. After this\r\nI found a Sentinel every fifteen or twenty rods until I came within two\r\nmiles of Hell Gate. Here I stayed until my feet began to freeze, and\r\nhaving nothing to eat I went a mile further up the river. It now being\r\nlate I crept into the bushes and lay down to think what to do next.\r\nI concluded to remain where I was during the night, and early in the\r\nmorning to go down to New York and endeavor to find some house to\r\nconceal myself in.\r\n\r\n“In the morning as soon as the Revelry Beating commenced I went on my\r\nway to New York which was eight miles from this place. After proceeding\r\nawhile I heard the morning guns fired from New York, though I was four\r\nmiles from it. I passed the sentinels unmolested down the middle of\r\nthe road, and arrived there before many were up. I met many British and\r\nHessian soldiers whom I knew very well, but they did not know me.\r\n\r\n“I went to a house, and found them friends of America, and was kindly\r\nreceived of them, and (they) promised to keep me a few days.\r\n\r\n“I had not been here but three quarters of an hour when I was obliged to\r\ncall for a bed. After being in bed two or three hours I was taken with\r\na stoppage in my breast, and made my resperation difficult, and still\r\nbeing afraid to cough loud for fear of being heard. The good lady of the\r\nhouse gave me some medicine of my own prescribing, which soon gave\r\nme relief. Soon after a rumor spread about town among the friends of\r\nAmerica of my confinement, and expecting soon to be retaken, they took\r\nmeasures to have me conveyed to Long Island, which was accordingly done.\r\n\r\n“Feb. 18th, 1778. The same day I was landed I walked nine miles, and put\r\nup at a friend’s house, during my walk I passed my Grandfather’s house,\r\nand dare not go in for fear he would deliver me up to the British. Next\r\nmorning I started on my journey again, and reached the place I intended\r\nat 12 o’clock, and put up with two friends. The next morning I and\r\ntwo companions started from our friends with four days provisions, and\r\nshovels and axes to build us a hut in the woods. We each of us had a\r\nmusket, powder, and balls. After going two miles in the woods we dug\r\naway the snow and made us a fire. After warming ourselves we set to work\r\nto build ourselves a hut; and got one side of it done the first day,\r\nand the next we finished it. It was tolerably comfortable. We kept large\r\nfires, and cooked our meat on the coals. In eight or ten days we had\r\nsome provisions brought us by our friends. At this time we heard that\r\nCaptain Rogers was cast away on Long Island, and concealed by some of\r\nhis friends. We went to see him, and found him. We attempted to stay in\r\nthe house in a back room. At about ten A. M. there came in a Tory, he\r\nknowing some of us seemed much troubled. We made him promise that he\r\nwould not make known our escape. The next day our two comrades went back\r\nto their old quarters, and Captain Rogers and myself and a friend\r\nwent into the woods and built us a hut, about ten miles from my former\r\ncompanions, with whom we kept up a constant correspondence. Soon a man\r\nwas brought to us by our friends, whom we found to be John Rolston, a\r\nman who was confined in the Provost Jail with us, and was carried to\r\nthe Hospital about three weeks after I was, and made his escape the same\r\nway, and by friends was brought to Long Island.\r\n\r\n“March 19th, 1778. About 5 o’clock a friend came to us and and said we\r\nhad an opportunity to go over to New England in a boat that had just\r\nlanded with four Tories, that had stolen the boat at Fairfield, Conn.\r\nWe immediately sent word to our two friends with whom I first helped to\r\nbuild a hut, but they could not be found. At sunset those that came in\r\nthe boat went off, and some of our friends guided us through the woods\r\nto the boat, taking two oars with us, for fear we should not find any\r\nin the boat. On arrival at the place our kind friends helped us off. We\r\nrowed very fast till we were a great distance from land. The moon rose\r\nsoon, and the wind being fair we arrived we knew not where, about a half\r\nhour before day. We went on shore, and soon found it was Norwalk, Conn.\r\nWe had bade farewell to Long Island, for the present, upon which I\r\ncomposed the following lines:--\r\n\r\n  “O fair you well, once happy land,\r\n    Where peace and plenty dwelt,\r\n  But now oppressed by tyrants’ hands,\r\n    Where naught but fury’s felt\r\n\r\n  “Behold I leave you for awhile,\r\n    To mourn for all your sons,\r\n  Who daily bleed that you may smile\r\n    When we’ve your freedom won\r\n\r\n“After being rested, just as the day began to dawn, we walked to a place\r\ncalled the Old Mill, where we found a guard (American) who hailed us at\r\na distance, and on coming up to him kindly received us, and invited\r\nus to his house to warm us. This being done we went home with Captain\r\nRodgers, for he lived in Norwalk. Here we went to bed at sunrise, and\r\nstayed till 10 o’clock. After dinner we took leave of Captain Rodgers\r\nand started for head-quarters in Pennsylvania, where the grand Army was\r\nat that time. In seven days we arrived at Valley Forge.\r\n\r\n“Elias Cornelius.”\r\n\r\nThis portion of the journal of Dr. Cornelius was published in the\r\n_Putnam County Republican_, in 1895, with a short account of the author.\r\n\r\nDr. Cornelius was born on Long Island in 1758, and was just twenty at\r\nthe time of his capture. His ancestors came from Holland. They were\r\nof good birth, and brought a seal bearing their coat of arms to this\r\ncountry. On the 15th of April, 1777, he was appointed surgeon’s mate to\r\nthe Second Regiment of Rhode Island troops under Colonel Israel Angell.\r\n\r\nThe article in the _Republican_ gives a description of Cunningham and\r\nthe Provost which we do not quote in full, as it contains little that\r\nis new. It says, however that “While Cunningham’s victims were dying\r\noff from cold and starvation like cattle, he is said to have actually\r\nmingled an arsenical preparation with the food to make them die the\r\nquicker. It is recorded that he boasted that he had killed more rebels\r\nwith his own hand than had been slain by all the King’s forces in\r\nAmerica.”\r\n\r\nCornelius continued in the Continental service until January 1st,\r\n1781, and received an honorable discharge. After the war he settled\r\nat Yorktown, Westchester County, and came to be known as the “beloved\r\nphysician.” He was very gentle and kind, and a great Presbyterian. He\r\ndied in 1823, and left descendants, one of whom is Judge C. M. Tompkins,\r\nof Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, Cunningham was not always in charge of the Provost. It\r\nappears that, during his absence in Philadelphia and other places, where\r\nhe spread death and destruction, he left Sergeant O’Keefe, almost as\r\ngreat a villian as himself, in charge of the hapless prisoners in New\r\nYork. It is to be hoped that his boast that he had killed more Americans\r\nthan all the King’s forces is an exaggeration. It may, however, be true\r\nthat in the years 1776 and 1777 he destroyed more American soldiers than\r\nhad, at that time, fallen on the field of battle.\r\n\r\nWhen an old building that had been used as a prison near the City Hall\r\nwas torn down a few years ago to make way for the Subway Station of\r\nthe Brooklyn Bridge, a great number of skeletons were found _in its\r\ncellars_. That these men starved to death or came to their end by\r\nviolence cannot be doubted. New York, at the time of the Revolution,\r\nextended to about three-quarters of a mile from the Battery, its suburbs\r\nlying around what is now Fulton Street. Cornelius speaks of the Bowery\r\nas about three-quarters of a mile from New York! “St. Paul’s Church,”\r\n says Mr. Haltigan, in his very readable book called “The Irish in the\r\nAmerican Revolution,” “where Washington attended divine service, is now\r\nthe only building standing that existed in those days, and that is a\r\nveritable monument to Irish and American patriotism. * * * On the Boston\r\nPost Road, where it crossed a brook in the vicinity of Fifty-Second\r\nstreet and Second avenue, then called Beekman’s Hill, William Beekman\r\nhad an extensive country house. During the Revolution this house was the\r\nBritish headquarters, and residence of Sir William Howe, where Nathan\r\nHale was condemned to death, and where Major Andrè received his last\r\ninstructions before going on his ill-fated mission to the traitor\r\nArnold.”\r\n\r\nLossing tells us of the imprisonment of one of the signers of the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, in the following language: “Suffering and\r\nwoe held terrible sway after Cornwallis and his army swept over\r\nthe plains of New Jersey. Like others of the signers of the great\r\nDeclaration, Richard Stockton was marked for peculiar vengeance by the\r\nenemy. So suddenly did the flying Americans pass by in the autumn of\r\n1776, and so soon were the Hessian vultures and their British companions\r\non the trail, that he had barely time to remove his family to a place of\r\nsafety before his beautiful mansion was filled with rude soldiery. The\r\nhouse was pillaged, the horses and stock were driven away, the furniture\r\nwas converted into fuel, the choice old wines in the cellar were drunk,\r\nthe valuable library, and all the papers of Mr. Stockton were committed\r\nto the flames, and the estate was laid waste. Mr. Stockton’s place of\r\nconcealment was discovered by a party of loyalists, who entered the\r\nhouse at night, dragged him from his bed, and treating him with every\r\nindignity that malice could invent, hurried him to New York, where he\r\nwas confined in the loathsome Provost Jail and treated with the utmost\r\ncruelty. When, through the interposition of Congress he was released,\r\nhis constitution was hopelessly shattered, and he did not live to\r\nsee the independence of his country achieved. He died at his home at\r\nPrinceton, in February, 1781, blessed to the last with the tender and\r\naffectionate attentions of his noble wife.”\r\n\r\nWe have gathered very little information about the British prisons in\r\nthe south, but that little shall be laid before the reader. It repeats\r\nthe same sad story of suffering and death of hundreds of martyrs to the\r\ncause of liberty, and of terrible cruelty on the part of the English as\r\nlong as they were victorious.\r\n\r\nMr. Haltigan tells of the “tender mercies” of Cornwallis at the south in\r\nthe following words: “Cornwallis was even more cruel than Clinton, and\r\nmore flagrant in his violations of the conditions of capitulation. After\r\nthe fall of Charleston the real misery of the inhabitants began. Every\r\nstipulation made by Sir Henry Clinton for their welfare was not only\r\ngrossly violated, but he sent out expeditions in various sections to\r\nplunder and kill the inhabitants, and scourge the country generally.\r\nOne of these under Tarleton surprised Colonel Buford and his Virginia\r\nregiment at Waxhaw, N. C., and while negotiations were pending for a\r\nsurrender, the Americans, without notice, were suddenly attacked and\r\nmassacred in cold blood. Colonel Buford and one hundred of his men saved\r\nthemselves only by flight. Though the rest sued for quarter, one hundred\r\nand thirteen of them were killed on the spot, and one hundred and fifty\r\nmore were so badly hacked by Tarleton’s dragoons that they could not\r\nbe removed. Only fifty-three out of the entire regiment were spared and\r\ntaken prisoners. ‘Tarleton’s quarter’ thereafter became the synonym for\r\nbarbarity. * * * Feeling the silent influence of the eminent citizens\r\nunder parole in Charleston, Cornwallis resolved to expatriate them to\r\nFlorida.\r\n\r\n“Lieutenant Governor Gadsden and seventy-seven other public and\r\ninfluential men were taken from their beds by armed parties, before\r\ndawn on the morning of the 27th of August, 1780, hurried on board\r\nthe Sandwich prison ship, without being allowed to bid adieu to their\r\nfamilies, and were conveyed to St. Augustine.\r\n\r\n“The pretence for this measure, by which the British authorities\r\nattempted to justify it, was the false accusation that these men were\r\nconcerting a scheme for burning the town and massacring the loyal\r\ninhabitants. Nobody believed the tale, and the act was made more\r\nflagrant by this wicked calumny. Arrived at St. Augustine the prisoners\r\nwere offered paroles to enjoy liberty within the precincts of the town.\r\nGadsden, the sturdy patriot, refused acquiescence, for he disdained\r\nmaking further terms with a power that did not regard the sanctity of a\r\nsolemn treaty. He was determined not to be deceived the second time.\r\n\r\n“‘Had the British commanders,’ he said, ‘regarded the terms of\r\ncapitulation at Charleston I might now, although a prisoner, enjoy the\r\nsmiles and consolations of my family under my own roof; but even without\r\na shadow of accusation preferred against me, for any act inconsistent\r\nwith my plighted faith, I am torn from them, and here, in a distant\r\nland, invited to enter into new engagements. I will give no parole.’\r\n\r\n“‘Think better of it,’ said Governor Tonyn, who was in command, ‘a\r\nsecond refusal of it will fix your destiny,--a dungeon will be your\r\nfuture habitation.’\r\n\r\n“‘Prepare it then,’ replied the inflexible patriot, ‘I will give no\r\nparole, so help me God!’\r\n\r\n“And the petty tyrant did prepare it, and for forty-two weeks that\r\npatriot, of almost threescore years of age, never saw the light of the\r\nblessed sun, but lay incarcerated in the dungeon of the castle of St\r\nAugustine. All the other prisoners accepted paroles, but they were\r\nexposed to indignities more harrowing to the sensitive soul than close\r\nconfinement. When they were exchanged, in June, 1781, they were not\r\nallowed even to touch at Charleston, but were sent to Philadelphia,\r\nwhither their families had been banished when the prisoners were taken\r\nto the Sandwich. More than a thousand persons were thus exiled, and\r\nhusbands and wives, fathers and children, first met in a distant State\r\nafter a separation of ten months.\r\n\r\n“Nearly all the soldiers taken prisoners at Charleston were confined in\r\nprison ships in the harbor, where foul air, bad food, filth, and\r\ndisease killed hundreds of them. Those confined at Haddrell’s Point also\r\nsuffered terribly. Many of them had been nurtured in affluence; now\r\nfar from friends and entirely without means, they were reduced to the\r\ngreatest straits. They were not even allowed to fish for their support,\r\nbut were obliged to perform the most menial services. After thirteen\r\nmonths captivity, Cornwallis ordered them to be sent to the West Indies,\r\nand this cruel order would have been carried out, but for the general\r\nexchange of prisoners which took place soon afterwards.\r\n\r\n“Governor Rutledge, in speaking before the South Carolina Assembly at\r\nJacksonboro, thus eloquently referred to the rigorous and unjustifiable\r\nconduct of the British authorities:\r\n\r\n“‘Regardless of the sacred ties of honor, destitute of the feelings\r\nof humanity, and determined to extinguish, if possible, every spark\r\nof freedom in this country, the enemy, with the insolent pride of\r\nconquerors, gave unbounded scope to the exercise of their tyrannical\r\ndisposition, infringed their public engagements, and violated their most\r\nsolemn treaties. Many of our worthiest citizens, without cause, were\r\nlong and closely confined, some on board prison ships, and others in the\r\ntown and castle of St. Augustine. Their properties were disposed of\r\nat the will and caprice of the enemy, and their families sent to\r\na different and distant part of the continent without the means of\r\nsupport. Many who had surrendered prisoners of war were killed in cold\r\nblood. Several suffered death in the most ignominious manner, and others\r\nwere delivered up to savages and put to tortures, under which they\r\nexpired. Thus the lives, liberties, and properties of the people were\r\ndependent solely on the pleasure of the British officers, who deprived\r\nthem of either or all on the most frivolous pretenses. Indians, slaves,\r\nand a desperate banditti of the most profligate characters were\r\ncaressed and employed by the enemy to execute their infamous purposes.\r\nDevastation and ruin marked their progress and that of their adherents;\r\nnor were their violences restrained by the charms or influence of beauty\r\nand innocence; even the fair sex, whom it is the duty of all, and\r\nthe pleasure and pride of the brave to protect, they and their tender\r\noffspring, were victims to the inveterate malice of an unrelenting foe.\r\nNeither the tears of mothers, nor the cries of infants could excite pity\r\nor compassion. Not only the peaceful habitation of the widow, the aged\r\nand the infirm, but the holy temples of the Most High were consumed in\r\nflames, kindled by their sacrilegious hands. They have tarnished\r\nthe glory of the British army, disgraced the profession of a British\r\nsoldiery, and fixed indelible stigmas of rapine, cruelty and peridy, and\r\nprofaneness on the British name.’”\r\n\r\nWhen in 1808 the Tammany Society of New York laid the cornerstone of a\r\nvault in which the bones of many of the prison ship martyrs were laid\r\nJoseph D. Fay, Esq., made an oration in which he said:\r\n\r\n“But the suffering of those unfortunate Americans whom the dreadful\r\nchances of war had destined for the prison-ships, were far greater than\r\nany which have been told. In that deadly season of the year, when the\r\ndog-star rages with relentless fury, when a pure air is especially\r\nnecessary to health, the British locked their prisoner, after long\r\nmarches, in the dungeons of ships affected with contagion, and reeking\r\nwith the filth of crowded captives, dead and dying. * * * No reasoning,\r\nno praying could obtain from his stern tyrants the smallest alleviation\r\nof his fate.\r\n\r\n“In South Carolina the British officer called Fraser, after trying in\r\nevery manner to induce the prisoners to enlist, said to them: ‘Go to\r\nyour dungeons in the prison ships, where you shall perish and rot, but\r\nfirst let me tell you that the rations which have been hitherto allowed\r\nfor your wives and children shall, from this moment, cease forever; and\r\nyou shall die assured that they are starving in the public streets, and\r\nthat _you_ are the authors of their fate.’\r\n\r\n“A sentence so terribly awful appalled the firm soul of every listening\r\nhero. A solemn silence followed the declaration; they cast their\r\nwondering eyes one upon the other, and valor, for a moment, hung\r\nsuspended between love of family, and love of country. Love of country\r\nat length rose superior to every other consideration, and moved by one\r\nimpulse, this glorious band of patriots thundered into the astonished\r\nears of their persecutors, ‘The prison-ships and Death, or Washington\r\nand our country!’\r\n\r\n“Meagre famine shook hands with haggard pestilence, joining a league to\r\nappall, conquer, and destroy the glorious spirit of liberty.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nA POET ON A PRISON SHIP\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilip Freneau, the poet of the Revolution, as he has been called, was\r\nof French Huguenot ancestry. The Freneaus came to New York in 1685. His\r\nmother was Agnes Watson, a resident of New York, and the poet was born\r\non the second of January, 1752.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1780 a vessel of which he was the owner, called the Aurora,\r\nwas taken by the British. Freneau was on board, though he was not the\r\ncaptain of the ship. The British man-of-war, Iris, made the Aurora her\r\nprize, after a fight in which the sailing master and many of the crew\r\nwere killed. This was in May, 1780. The survivors were brought to New\r\nYork, and confined on board the prison ship, Scorpion. Freneau has left\r\na poem describing the horrors of his captivity in very strong language,\r\nand it is easy to conceive that his suffering must have been intense\r\nto have aroused such bitter feelings. We give a part of his poem, as\r\nit contains the best description of the indignities inflicted upon the\r\nprisoners, and their mental and physical sufferings that we have found\r\nin any work on the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART OF PHILIP FRENEAU’S POEM ON THE PRISON SHIPS\r\n\r\n  Conveyed to York we found, at length, too late,\r\n  That Death was better than the prisoner’s fate\r\n  There doomed to famine, shackles, and despair,\r\n  Condemned to breathe a foul, infected air,\r\n  In sickly hulks, devoted while we lay,--\r\n  Successive funerals gloomed each dismal day\r\n\r\n  The various horrors of these hulks to tell--\r\n  These prison ships where Pain and Penance dwell,\r\n  Where Death in ten-fold vengeance holds his reign,\r\n  And injured ghosts, yet unavenged, complain:\r\n  This be my task--ungenerous Britons, you\r\n  Conspire to murder whom you can’t subdue\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  So much we suffered from the tribe I hate,\r\n  So near they shoved us to the brink of fate,\r\n  When two long months in these dark hulks we lay,\r\n  Barred down by night, and fainting all the day,\r\n  In the fierce fervors of the solar beam\r\n  Cooled by no breeze on Hudson’s mountain stream,\r\n  That not unsung these threescore days shall fall\r\n  To black oblivion that would cover all.\r\n\r\n  No masts or sails these crowded ships adorn,\r\n  Dismal to view, neglected and forlorn;\r\n  Here mighty ills oppressed the imprisoned throng;\r\n  Dull were our slumbers, and our nights were long.\r\n  From morn to eve along the decks we lay,\r\n  Scorched into fevers by the solar ray;\r\n  No friendly awning cast a welcome shade,\r\n  Once was it promised, and was never made;\r\n  No favors could these sons of Death bestow,\r\n  ‘Twas endless vengeance, and unceasing woe.\r\n  Immortal hatred doth their breasts engage,\r\n  And this lost empire swells their souls with rage.\r\n\r\n  Two hulks on Hudson’s stormy bosom lie,\r\n  Two, on the east, alarm the pitying eye,\r\n  There, the black Scorpion at her mooring rides,\r\n  And there Strombolo, swinging, yields the tides;\r\n  Here bulky Jersey fills a larger space,\r\n  And Hunter, to all hospitals disgrace.\r\n  Thou Scorpion, fatal to thy crowded throng,\r\n  Dire theme of horror to Plutonian song,\r\n  Requir’st my lay,--thy sultry decks I know,\r\n  And all the torments that exist below!\r\n  The briny wave that Hudson’s bosom fills\r\n  Drained through her bottom in a thousand rills;\r\n  Rotten and old, replete with sighs and groans,\r\n  Scarce on the water she sustained her bones:\r\n\r\n  Here, doomed to toil, or founder in the tide,\r\n  At the moist pumps incessantly we plied;\r\n  Here, doomed to starve, like famished dogs we tore\r\n  The scant allowance that our tyrants bore.\r\n  Remembrance shudders at this scene of fears,\r\n  Still in my view, some tyrant chief appears,\r\n  Some base-born Hessian slave walks threatening by,\r\n  Some servile Scot with murder in his eye,\r\n  Still haunts my sight, as vainly they bemoan\r\n  Rebellions managed so unlike their own.\r\n  O may I never feel the poignant pain\r\n  To live subjected to such fiends again!\r\n  Stewards and mates that hostile Britain bore,\r\n  Cut from the gallows on their native shore;\r\n  Their ghastly looks and vengeance beaming eyes\r\n  Still to my view in dismal visions rise,--\r\n  O may I ne’er review these dire abodes,\r\n  These piles for slaughter floating on the floods!\r\n  And you that o’er the troubled ocean go\r\n  Strike not your standards to this venomed foe,\r\n  Better the greedy wave should swallow all,\r\n  Better to meet the death-conducting ball,\r\n  Better to sleep on ocean’s oozy bed,\r\n  At once destroyed and numbered with the dead,\r\n  Than thus to perish in the face of day\r\n  Where twice ten thousand deaths one death delay.\r\n  When to the ocean sinks the western sun,\r\n  And the scorched tories fire their evening gun,\r\n  “Down, rebels, down!” the angry Scotchmen cry,\r\n  “Base dogs, descend, or by our broadswords die!”\r\n\r\n  Hail, dark abode! What can with thee compare?\r\n  Heat, sickness, famine, death, and stagnant air,--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Swift from the guarded decks we rushed along,\r\n  And vainly sought repose, so vast our throng.\r\n  Three hundred wretches here, denied all light,\r\n  In crowded quarters pass the infernal night.\r\n  Some for a bed their tattered vestments join,\r\n  And some on chest, and some on floors recline;\r\n  Shut from the blessings of the evening air\r\n  Pensive we lay with mingled corpses there:\r\n  Meagre and wan, and scorched with heat below,\r\n  We looked like ghosts ere death had made us so:\r\n  How could we else, where heat and hunger joined\r\n  Thus to debase the body and the mind?\r\n  Where cruel thirst the parching throat invades,\r\n  Dries up the man and fits him for the shades?\r\n  No waters laded from the bubbling spring\r\n  To these dire ships these little tyrants bring--\r\n  By plank and ponderous beams completely walled\r\n  In vain for water, still in vain we called.\r\n  No drop was granted to the midnight prayer\r\n  To rebels in these regions of despair!\r\n  The loathsome cask a deadly dose contains,\r\n  Its poison circles through the languid veins.\r\n  “Here, generous Briton, generous, as you say,\r\n  To my parched tongue one cooling drop convey--\r\n  Hell has no mischief like a thirsty throat,\r\n  Nor one tormentor like your David Sproat!”\r\n\r\n  Dull flew the hours till, from the East displayed,\r\n  Sweet morn dispelled the horrors of the shade:\r\n  On every side dire objects met the sight,\r\n  And pallid forms, and murders of the night:\r\n  The dead were past their pains, the living groan,\r\n  Nor dare to hope another morn their own.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  O’er distant streams appears the living green,\r\n  And leafy trees on mountain tops are seen:\r\n  But they no grove or grassy mountain tread,\r\n  Marked for a longer journey to the dead.\r\n\r\n  Black as the clouds that shade St. Kilda’s shore,\r\n  Wild as the winds that round her mountains roar,\r\n  At every post some surly vagrant stands,\r\n  Culled from the English, or the Scottish bands.\r\n  Dispensing death triumphantly they stand,\r\n  Their musquets ready to obey command;\r\n  Wounds are their sport, and ruin is their aim;\r\n  On their dark souls compassion has no claim,\r\n  And discord only can their spirits please,\r\n  Such were our tyrants here, such foes as these.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  But such a train of endless woes abound\r\n  So many mischiefs in these hulks are found\r\n  That on them all a poem to prolong\r\n  Would swell too high the horrors of our song.\r\n  Hunger and thirst to work our woe combine,\r\n  And mouldy bread, and flesh of rotten swine;\r\n  The mangled carcase and the battered brain;\r\n  The doctor’s poison, and the captain’s cane;\r\n  The soldier’s musquet, and the steward’s debt:\r\n  The evening shackle, and the noonday threat.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  That charm whose virtue warms the world beside,\r\n  Was by these tyrants to our use denied.\r\n  While yet they deigned that healthsome balm to lade,\r\n  The putrid water felt its powerful aid;\r\n  But when refused, to aggravate our pains,\r\n  Then fevers raged and revelled through our veins;\r\n  Throughout my frame I felt its deadly heat;\r\n  I felt my pulse with quicker motions beat;\r\n  A pallid hue o’er every face was spread,\r\n  Unusual pains attacked the fainting head:\r\n  No physic here, no doctor to assist,\r\n  With oaths they placed me on the sick man’s list:\r\n  Twelve wretches more the same dark symptoms took,\r\n  And these were entered on the doctor’s book.\r\n  The loathsome Hunter was our destined place,\r\n  The Hunter, to all hospitals disgrace.\r\n  With soldiers sent to guard us on the road,\r\n  Joyful we left the Scorpion’s dire abode:\r\n  Some tears we shed for the remaining crew,\r\n  Then cursed the hulk, and from her sides withdrew.\r\n\r\n  THE HOSPITAL PRISON SHIP\r\n\r\n  Now towards the Hunter’s gloomy decks we came,\r\n  A slaughter house, yet hospital in name;\r\n  For none came there till ruined with their fees,\r\n  And half consumed, and dying of disease:--\r\n\r\n  But when too near, with laboring oar, we plied,\r\n  The Mate, with curses, drove us from the side:--\r\n  That wretch, who banished from the navy crew,\r\n  Grown old in blood did here his trade renew.\r\n  His rancorous tongue, when on his charge let loose,\r\n  Uttered reproaches, scandal, and abuse;\r\n  Gave all to hell who dared his king disown,\r\n  And swore mankind were made for George alone.\r\n  A thousand times, to irritate our woe,\r\n  He wished us foundered in the gulph below:\r\n  A thousand times he brandished high his stick,\r\n  And swore as often, that we were not sick:--\r\n  And yet so pale! that we were thought by some\r\n  A freight of ghosts from Death’s dominions come.\r\n  But, calmed at length, for who can always rage?\r\n  Or the fierce war of boundless passion wage?\r\n  He pointed to the stairs that led below\r\n  To damps, disease, and varied forms of woe:--\r\n  Down to the gloom I took my pensive way,\r\n  Along the decks the dying captives lay,\r\n  Some struck with madness, some with scurvy pained,\r\n  But still of putrid fevers most complained.\r\n  On the hard floors the wasted objects laid\r\n  There tossed and tumbled in the dismal shade:\r\n  There no soft voice their bitter fate bemoaned,\r\n  But Death strode stately, while his victims groaned.\r\n  Of leaky decks I heard them long complain,\r\n  Drowned as they were in deluges of rain:\r\n  Denied the comforts of a dying bed,\r\n  And not a pillow to support the head:\r\n  How could they else but pine, and grieve and sigh,\r\n  Detest a wretched life, and wish to die?\r\n\r\n  Scarce had I mingled with this wretched band,\r\n  When a thin victim seized me by the hand:--\r\n  “And art thou come?”--death heavy on his eyes--\r\n  “And art thou come to these abodes?” he cries,\r\n  “Why didst thou leave the Scorpion’s dark retreat?\r\n  And hither haste, a surer death to meet?\r\n  Why didst thou leave thy damp, infected cell?\r\n  If that was purgatory, this is hell.\r\n  We too, grown weary of that horrid shade,\r\n  Petitioned early for the Doctor’s aid;\r\n  His aid denied, more deadly symptoms came,\r\n  Weak and yet weaker, glowed the vital flame;\r\n  And when disease had worn us down so low\r\n  That few could tell if we were ghosts or no,\r\n  And all asserted death would be our fate,\r\n  Then to the Doctor we were sent, too late”\r\n\r\n  Ah! rest in peace, each injured, parted shade,\r\n  By cruel hands in death’s dark weeds arrayed,\r\n  The days to come shall to your memory raise\r\n  Piles on these shores, to spread through earth your praise.\r\n\r\n  THE HESSIAN DOCTOR\r\n\r\n  From Brooklyn heights a Hessian doctor came,\r\n  Nor great his skill, nor greater much his fame:\r\n  Fair Science never called the wretch her son,\r\n  And Art disdained the stupid man to own.\r\n\r\n  He on his charge the healing work begun\r\n  With antmomial mixtures by the tun:\r\n  Ten minutes was the time he deigned to stay,\r\n  The time of grace allotted once a day:\r\n  He drenched us well with bitter draughts, tis true,\r\n  Nostrums from hell, and cortex from Peru:\r\n  Some with his pills he sent to Pluto’s reign,\r\n  And some he blistered with his flies of Spain.\r\n  His Tartar doses walked their deadly round,\r\n  Till the lean patient at the potion frowned,\r\n  And swore that hemlock, death, or what you will,\r\n  Were nonsense to the drugs that stuffed his bill.\r\n  On those refusing he bestowed a kick,\r\n  Or menaced vengeance with his walking stick:\r\n  Here uncontrolled he exercised his trade,\r\n  And grew experienced by the deaths he made.\r\n\r\n  Knave though he was, yet candor must confess\r\n  Not chief physician was this man of Hesse:\r\n  One master o’er the murdering tribe was placed,\r\n  By him the rest were honored or disgraced\r\n  Once, and but once, by some strange fortune led,\r\n  He came to see the dying and the dead.\r\n  He came, but anger so inflamed his eye,\r\n  And such a faulchion glittered on his thigh,\r\n  And such a gloom his visage darkened o’er,\r\n  And two such pistols in his hands he bore,\r\n  That, by the gods, with such a load of steel,\r\n  We thought he came to murder, not to heal.\r\n  Rage in his heart, and mischief in his head,\r\n  He gloomed destruction, and had smote us dead\r\n  Had he so dared, but fear withheld his hand,\r\n  He came, blasphemed, and turned again to land\r\n\r\n  THE BENEVOLENT CAPTAIN\r\n\r\n  From this poor vessel, and her sickly crew\r\n  A british seaman all his titles drew,\r\n  Captain, Esquire, Commander, too, in chief,\r\n  And hence he gained his bread and hence his beef:\r\n  But sir, you might have searched creation round,\r\n  And such another ruffian not have found\r\n  Though unprovoked an angry face he bore,--\r\n  All were astonished at the oaths he swore\r\n  He swore, till every prisoner stood aghast,\r\n  And thought him Satan in a brimstone blast\r\n  He wished us banished from the public light;\r\n  He wished us shrouded in perpetual night;\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  He swore, besides, that should the ship take fire\r\n  We, too, must in the pitchy flames expire--\r\n  That if we wretches did not scrub the decks\r\n  His staff should break our base, rebellious necks;\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  If, where he walked, a murdered carcase lay,\r\n  Still dreadful was the language of the day;\r\n  He called us dogs, and would have held us so,\r\n  But terror checked the meditated blow\r\n  Of vengeance, from our injured nation due,\r\n  To him, and all the base, unmanly crew\r\n  Such food they sent to make complete our woes\r\n  It looked like carrion torn from hungry crows\r\n  Such vermin vile on every joint were seen,\r\n  So black, corrupted, mortified, and lean,\r\n  That once we tried to move our flinty chief,\r\n  And thus addressed him, holding up the beef--\r\n  “See, Captain, see, what rotten bones we pick,\r\n  What kills the healthy cannot cure the sick,\r\n  Not dogs on such by Christian men are fed,\r\n  And see, good master, see, what lousy bread!”\r\n   “Your meat or bread,” this man of death replied,\r\n  “Tis not my care to manage or provide\r\n  But this, base rebel dogs I’d have you know,\r\n  That better than you merit we bestow--\r\n  Out of my sight!” nor more he deigned to say,\r\n  But whisked about, and frowning, strode away\r\n\r\n  CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n  Each day at least six carcases we bore\r\n  And scratched them graves along the sandy shore\r\n  By feeble hands the shallow graves were made,\r\n  No stone memorial o’er the corpses laid\r\n  In barren sands and far from home they lie,\r\n  No friend to shed a tear when passing by\r\n  O’er the mean tombs insulting Britons tread,\r\n  Spurn at the sand, and curse the rebel dead.\r\n  When to your arms these fatal islands fall--\r\n  For first or last, they must be conquered, all,\r\n  Americans! to rites sepulchral just\r\n  With gentlest footstep press this kindred dust,\r\n  And o’er the tombs, if tombs can then be found,\r\n  Place the green turf, and plant the myrtle round\r\n\r\nThis poem was written in 1780, the year that Freneau was captured. He\r\nwas on board the Scorpion and Hunter about two months, and was then\r\nexchanged. We fear that he has not in the least exaggerated the horrors\r\nof his situation. In fact there seem to have been many bloody pages torn\r\nfrom the book of history, that can never be perused. Many dark deeds\r\nwere done in these foul prisons, of which we can only give hints, and\r\nthe details of many crimes committed against the helpless prisoners are\r\nleft to our imaginations. But enough and more than enough is known to\r\nmake us fear that _inhumanity_, a species of cruelty unknown to the\r\nlower animals, is really one of the most prominent characteristics of\r\nmen. History is a long and bloody record of battles, massacres, torture\r\nchambers; greed and violence; bigotry and sin. The root of all crimes\r\nis selfishness. What we call inhumanity is we fear not _inhuman_, but\r\n_human nature unrestrained_. It is true that some progress is made,\r\nand it is no longer the custom to kill all captives, at least not in\r\ncivilized countries. But war will always be “_horrida bella_,” chiefly\r\nbecause war means license, when the unrestrained, wolfish passions of\r\nman get for the time the upper hand. Our task, however, is not that of\r\na moralist, but of a narrator of facts, from which all who read can draw\r\nthe obvious moral for themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n“THERE WAS A SHIP”\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the ships that were ever launched the “Old Jersey” is the\r\nmost notorious. Never before or since, in the dark annals of human\r\nsufferings, has so small a space enclosed such a heavy weight of misery.\r\nNo other prison has destroyed so many human beings in so short a space\r\nof time. And yet the Jersey was once as staunch and beautiful a vessel\r\nas ever formed a part of the Royal Navy of one of the proudest nations\r\nof the world. How little did her builders imagine that she would go down\r\nto history accompanied by the execrations of all who are acquainted with\r\nher terrible record!\r\n\r\nIt is said that it was in the late spring of 1780 that the Old Jersey,\r\nas she was then called, was first moored in Wallabout Bay, off the coast\r\nof Long Island. We can find no record to prove that she was used as a\r\nprison ship until the winter of that year. She was, at first, a hospital\r\nship for British soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the removal of the unfortunate prisoners from the ships\r\nin New York Harbor was that pestilential sickness was fast destroying\r\nthem, and it was feared that the inhabitants of New York would suffer\r\nfrom the prevailing epidemics. They were therefore placed in rotten\r\nhulks off the quiet shores of Long Island, where, secluded from the\r\npublic eye, they were allowed to perish by the thousands from cruel and\r\ncriminal neglect.\r\n\r\n“The Old Jersey and the two hospital ships,” says General J. Johnson,\r\n“remained in the Wallabout until New York was evacuated by the British.\r\nThe Jersey was the receiving ship: the others, truly, the ships of\r\ndeath!\r\n\r\n“It has been generally thought that all the prisoners died on board the\r\nJersey. This is not true. Many may have died on board of her who were\r\nnot reported as sick, but all who were placed on the sick list were\r\nremoved to the hospital ships, from which they were usually taken, sewed\r\nup in a blanket, to their graves.\r\n\r\n“After the hospital ships were brought into the Wallabout, it was\r\nreported that the sick were attended by physicians. Few indeed were\r\nthose who recovered, or came back to tell the tale of their sufferings\r\nin those horrible places. It was no uncommon sight to see five or\r\nsix dead bodies brought on shore in a single morning, when a small\r\nexcavation would be dug at the foot of the hill, the bodies cast into\r\nit, and then a man with a shovel would quickly cover them by shovelling\r\nsand down the hill upon them.\r\n\r\n“Many were buried in a ravine of this hill and many on Mr. Remsen’s\r\nfarm. The whole shore, from Rennie’s Point, to Mr. Remsen’s dooryard,\r\nwas a place of graves; as were also the slope of the hill near the\r\nhouse; the shore, from Mr. Remsen’s barn along the mill-pond to\r\nRappelye’s farm; and the sandy island between the flood-gates and the\r\nmill-dam, while a few were buried on the shore on the east side of the\r\nWallabout.\r\n\r\n“Thus did Death reign here, from 1776 (when the Whitby prison ship was\r\nfirst moored in the Wallabout) until the peace. The whole Wallabout was\r\na sickly place during the war. The atmosphere seemed to be charged with\r\nfoul air: from the prison ships; and with the effluvia of dead bodies\r\nwashed out of their graves by the tides. * * * More than half of the\r\ndead buried on the outer side of the mill-pond, were washed out by the\r\nwaves at high tide, during northeasterly winds.\r\n\r\n“The bodies of the dead lay exposed along the beach, drying and\r\nbleaching in the sun, and whitening the shores, till reached by the\r\npower of a succeeding storm, as the agitated waves receded, the bones\r\nreceded with them into the deep, where they remain, unseen by man,\r\nawaiting the resurrection morn, when, again joined to the spirits to\r\nwhich they belong, they will meet their persecuting murderers at the bar\r\nof the Supreme Judge of the quick and the dead.\r\n\r\n“We have ourselves,” General Johnson continues, “examined many of\r\nthe skulls lying on the shore. From the teeth they appeared to be the\r\nremains of men in the prime of life.”\r\n\r\nWe will quote more of this interesting account written by an eyewitness\r\nof the horrors he records, in a later chapter. At present we will\r\nendeavor to give the reader a short history of the Jersey, from the day\r\nof her launching to her degradation, when she was devoted to the foul\r\nusages of a prison ship.\r\n\r\nShe was a fourth rate ship of the line, mounting sixty guns, and\r\ncarrying a crew of four hundred men. She was built in 1736, having\r\nsucceeded to the name of a celebrated 50-gun ship, which was then\r\nwithdrawn from the service, and with which she must not be confounded.\r\nIn 1737 she was fitted for sea as one of the Channel Fleet, commanded by\r\nSir John Norris.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1738 the command of the Jersey was given to Captain\r\nEdmund Williams, and in July, 1739, she was one of the vessels which\r\nwere sent to the Mediterranean under Rear Admiral Chaloner Ogle, when\r\na threatened rupture with Spain rendered it necessary to strengthen the\r\nnaval force in that quarter.\r\n\r\nThe trouble in the Mediterranean having been quieted by the appearance\r\nof so strong a fleet, in 1740 the Jersey returned home; but she was\r\nagain sent out, under the command of Captain Peter Lawrence, and was one\r\nof the vessels forming the fleet of Sir John Norris, when, in the\r\nfall of that year and in the spring of 1741, that gentleman made his\r\nfruitless demonstrations against the Spanish coast. Soon afterwards the\r\nJersey, still forming one of the fleet commanded by Sir Chaloner Ogle,\r\nwas sent to the West Indies, to strengthen the forces at that station,\r\ncommanded by Vice-Admiral Vernon, and she was with that distinguished\r\nofficer when he made his well-known, unsuccessful attack on Carthagena,\r\nand the Spanish dominions in America in that year.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1743, Captain Lawrence was succeeded m the command of the\r\nJersey by Captain Harry Norris, youngest son of Admiral Sir John Norris:\r\nand the Jersey formed one of the fleet commanded by Sir John Norris,\r\nwhich was designed to watch the enemy’s Brest fleet; but having suffered\r\nseverely from a storm while on that station, she was obliged to return\r\nto the Downs.\r\n\r\nCaptain Harry Norris having been promoted to a heavier ship, the\r\ncommand of the Jersey was given soon afterwards to Captain Charles Hardy\r\nsubsequently well known as Governor of the Colony of New York; and in\r\nJune, 1744, that officer having been appointed to the command of the\r\nNewfoundland Station, she sailed for North America, and bore his flag in\r\nthose waters during the remainder of the year. In 1745, still under\r\nthe immediate command of Captain Hardy, the Jersey was one of the ships\r\nwhich, under Vice-Admiral Medley, were sent to the Mediterranean, where\r\nVice-Admiral Sir William Rowley then commanded; and as she continued\r\non that station during the following year there is little doubt that\r\nCaptain Hardy remained there, during the remainder of his term of\r\nservice on that vessel.\r\n\r\nIt was while under the command of Captain Hardy in July, 1745, that the\r\nJersey was engaged with the French ship, St. Esprit, of 74 guns, in one\r\nof the most desperate engagements on record. The action continued during\r\ntwo hours and a half, when the St. Esprit was compelled to bear away for\r\nCadiz, where she was repaired and refitted for sea. At the close of\r\nSir Charles Hardy’s term of service in 1747, the Jersey was laid up,\r\nevidently unfit for active service; and in October, 1748, she was\r\nreported among the “hulks” in port.\r\n\r\nOn the renewal of hostilities with France in 1756 the Jersey was\r\nrefitted for service, and the command given to Captain John Barker, and\r\nin May, 1757, she was sent to the Mediterranean, where, under the orders\r\nof Admiral Henry Osbourne, she continued upwards of two years, having\r\nbeen present, on the 28th of February, 1758, when M. du Quesne made his\r\nineffectual attempt to reinforce M. De la Clue, who was then closely\r\nconfined, with the fleet under his command, in the harbor of Carthagena.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of August, 1759, while commanded by Captain Barker, the\r\nJersey, with the Culloden and the Conqueror, were ordered by Admiral\r\nBoscowan, the commander of the fleet, to proceed to the mouth of the\r\nharbor of Toulon, for the purpose of cutting out or destroying two\r\nFrench ships which were moored there under cover of the batteries with\r\nthe hope of forcing the French Admiral, De la Clue, to an engagement.\r\nThe three ships approached the harbour, as directed, with great\r\nfirmness; but they were assailed by so heavy a fire, not only from the\r\nenemy’s ships and fortifications, but from several masked batteries,\r\nthat, after an unequal but desperate contest of upwards of three hours,\r\nthey were compelled to retire without having succeeded in their object;\r\nand to repair to Gibraltar to be refitted.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the year 1759 Captain Barker was succeeded in the\r\ncommand of the Jersey by Captain Andrew Wilkinson, under whom, forming\r\none of the Mediterranean fleet, commanded by Sir Charles Saunders, she\r\ncontinued in active service until 1763.\r\n\r\nIn 1763 peace was established, and the Jersey returned to England and\r\nwas laid up; but in May, 1766, she was again commissioned, and under\r\nthe command of Captain William Dickson, and bearing the flag of Admiral\r\nSpry, she was ordered to her former station in the Mediterranean, where\r\nshe remained three years.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1769, bearing the flag of Commodore Sir John Byron, the\r\nJersey sailed for America. She seems to have returned home at the close\r\nof the summer, and her active duties appear to have been brought to an\r\nend.\r\n\r\nShe remained out of commission until 1776, when, without armament, and\r\nunder the command of Captain Anthony Halstead, she was ordered to New\r\nYork as a hospital ship.\r\n\r\nCaptain Halstead died on the 17th of May, 1778, and, in July following,\r\nhe was succeeded by Commander David Laird, under whom, either as a\r\nhospital, or a prison ship, she remained in Wallabout bay, until she was\r\nabandoned at the close of the war, to her fate, which was to rot in the\r\nmud at her moorings, until, at last, she sank, and for many years her\r\nwretched worm-eaten old hulk could be seen at low tide, shunned by all,\r\na sorry spectacle, the ghost of what had once been a gallant man-of-war.\r\n\r\nThis short history of the Jersey has been condensed from the account\r\nwritten in 1865 by Mr. Henry B. Dawson and published at Morrisania, New\r\nYork, in that year.\r\n\r\nIn an oration delivered by Mr. Jonathan Russel, in Providence, R. I., on\r\nthe 4th of July 1800, he thus speaks of this ill-fated vessel and of her\r\nvictims: “But it was not in the ardent conflicts of the field only, that\r\nour countrymen fell; it was not the ordinary chances of war alone\r\nwhich they had to encounter. Happy indeed, thrice happy were Warren,\r\nMontgomery, and Mercer; happy those other gallant spirits who fell with\r\nglory in the heat of the battle, distinguished by their country and\r\ncovered with her applause. Every soul sensible to honor, envies rather\r\nthan compassionates their fate. It was in the dungeons of our inhuman\r\ninvaders; it was in the loathsome and pestiferous prisons, that the\r\nwretchedness of our countrymen still makes the heart bleed. It was\r\nthere that hunger, and thirst, and disease, and all the contumely that\r\ncold-hearted cruelty could bestow, sharpened every pang of death. Misery\r\nthere wrung every fibre that could feel, before she gave the Blow of\r\nGrace which sent the sufferer to eternity. It is said that poison was\r\nemployed. No, there was no such mercy there. There, nothing was employed\r\nwhich could blunt the susceptibility to anguish, or which, by hastening\r\ndeath, could rob its agonies of a single pang. On board one only of\r\nthese Prison ships above 11,000 of our brave countrymen are said to have\r\nperished. She was called the Jersey. Her wreck still remains, and at low\r\nebb, presents to the world its accursed and blighted fragments. Twice\r\nin twenty-four hours the winds of Heaven sigh through it, and repeat\r\nthe groans of our expiring countrymen; and twice the ocean hides in\r\nher bosom those deadly and polluted ruins, which all her waters cannot\r\npurify. Every rain that descends washes from the unconsecrated bank\r\nthe bones of those intrepid sufferers. They lie, naked on the shore,\r\naccusing the neglect of their countrymen. How long shall gratitude,\r\nand even piety deny them burial? They ought to be collected in one vast\r\nossory, which shall stand a monument to future ages, of the two extremes\r\nof human character: of that depravity which, trampling on the rights of\r\nmisfortune, perpetrated cold and calculating murder on a wretched and\r\ndefenceless prisoner; and that virtue which animated this prisoner to\r\ndie a willing martyr to his country. Or rather, were it possible, there\r\nought to be raised a Colossal Column whose base sinking to Hell, should\r\nlet the murderers read their infamy inscribed upon it; and whose capital\r\nof Corinthian laurel ascending to Heaven, should show the sainted\r\nPatriots that they have triumphed.\r\n\r\n“Deep and dreadful as the coloring of this picture may appear, it is\r\nbut a taint and imperfect sketch of the original. You must remember a\r\nthousand unutterable calamities; a thousand instances of domestic as\r\nwell as national anxiety and distress; which mock description. You\r\nought to remember them; you ought to hand them down in tradition to your\r\nposterity, that they may know the awful price their fathers paid for\r\nfreedom.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nA DESCRIPTION OF THE JERSEY\r\n\r\n\r\nSONNET\r\n\r\nSUGGESTED BY A VISION OF THE JERSEY PRISON SHIP\r\n\r\nBY W P P\r\n\r\n  O Sea! in whose unfathomable gloom\r\n  A world forlorn of wreck and ruin lies,\r\n  In thy avenging majesty arise,\r\n  And with a sound as of the trump of doom\r\n  Whelm from all eyes for aye yon living tomb,\r\n  Wherein the martyr patriots groaned for years,\r\n  A prey to hunger and the bitter jeers\r\n  Of foes in whose relentless breasts no room\r\n  Was ever found for pity or remorse;\r\n  But haunting anger and a savage hate,\r\n  That spared not e’en their victim’s very corse,\r\n  But left it, outcast, to its carrion fate\r\n  Wherefore, arise, O Sea! and sternly sweep\r\n  This floating dungeon to thy lowest deep\r\n\r\nIt was stated in the portion of the eloquent oration given in our last\r\nchapter that more than 11,000 prisoners perished on board the Jersey\r\nalone, during the space of three years and a half that she was moored in\r\nthe waters of Wallabout Bay. This statement has never been contradicted,\r\nas far as we know, by British authority. Yet we trust that it is\r\nexaggerated. It would give an average of more than three thousand deaths\r\na year. The whole number of names copied from the English War Records\r\nof prisoners on board the Jersey is about 8,000. This, however, is an\r\nincomplete list. You will in vain search through its pages to find the\r\nrecorded names of many prisoners who have left well attested accounts of\r\ntheir captivity on board that fatal vessel. All that we can say now is\r\nthat the number who perished there is very great.\r\n\r\nAs late as 1841 the bones of many of these victims were still to be\r\nfound on the shores of Walabout Bay, in and around the Navy Yard. On the\r\n4th of February of that year some workmen, while engaged in digging\r\naway an embankment in Jackson Street, Brooklyn, near the Navy Yard,\r\naccidentally uncovered a quantity of human bones, among which was a\r\nskeleton having a pair of iron manacles still upon the wrists. (See\r\nThompson’s History of Long Island, Vol. 1, page 247.)\r\n\r\nIn a paper published at Fishkill on the 18th of May, 1783, is the\r\nfollowing card: “To All Printers, of Public Newspapers:--Tell it to the\r\nworld, and let it be published in every Newspaper throughout America,\r\nEurope, Asia, and Africa, to the everlasting disgrace and infamy of the\r\nBritish King’s commanders at New York: That during the late war it\r\nis said that 11,644 American prisoners have suffered death by their\r\ninhuman, cruel, savage, and barbarous usage on board the filthy and\r\nmalignant British prison ship called the Jersey, lying at New York.\r\nBritons tremble, lest the vengeance of Heaven fall on your isle, for the\r\nblood of these unfortunate victims!\r\n\r\n  “An American”\r\n\r\n  “They died, the young, the loved, the brave,\r\n    The death barge came for them,\r\n  And where the seas yon black rocks lave\r\n    Is heard their requiem\r\n  They buried them and threw the sand\r\n  Unhallowed o’er that patriot band\r\n\r\n  The black ship like a demon sate\r\n    Upon the prowling deep,\r\n  From her came fearful sounds of hate,\r\n    Till pain stilled all in sleep\r\n  It was the sleep that victims take,\r\n  Tied, tortured, dying, at the stake.\r\n\r\n  Yet some the deep has now updug,\r\n    Their bones are in the sun,\r\n  Whether by sword or deadly drug\r\n    They perished, one by one,\r\n  Was it not dread for mortal eye\r\n  To see them all so strangely die?\r\n\r\n  Are there those murdered men who died\r\n    For freedom and for me?\r\n  They seem to point, in martyred pride\r\n    To that spot upon the sea\r\n  From whence came once the frenzied yell,\r\n  From out that wreck, that prison hell”\r\n\r\nThis rough but strong old poem was written many years ago by a Mr.\r\nWhitman We have taken the liberty of retouching it to a slight degree.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that _twenty hogsheads_ of bones were collected in 1808\r\nfrom the shores of the Wallabout, and buried under the auspices of the\r\nTammany Society in a vault prepared for the purpose. These were but a\r\nsmall part of the remains of the victims of the prison ships. Many were,\r\nas we have seen, washed into the sea, and many more were interred on the\r\nshores of New York Harbor, before the prison ships were removed to the\r\nWallabout. It will be better that we should give the accounts left to us\r\nby eye witnesses of the sufferings on board these prison ships, and\r\nwe will therefore quote from the narrative of John Van Dyke, who was\r\nconfined on board the Jersey before her removal to the Wallabout.\r\n\r\nCaptain John Van Dyke was taken prisoner in May, 1780, at which time\r\nhe says: “We were put on board the prison ship Jersey, anchored off Fly\r\nMarket. (New York City) This ship had been a hospital ship. When I came\r\non board her stench was so great, and my breathing this putrid air--I\r\nthought it would kill me, but after being on board some days I got used\r\nto it, and as though all was a common smell. * * *\r\n\r\n“On board the Jersey prison ship it was short allowance, so short\r\na person would think it was not possible for a man to live on. They\r\nstarved the American prisoners to make them enlist in their service. I\r\nwill now relate a fact. Every man in a mess of six took his daily turn\r\nto get the mess’s provisions. One day I went to the galley and drew a\r\npiece of salt, boiled pork. I went to our mess to divide it. * * * I cut\r\neach one his share, and each one eat our day’s allowance in one mouthful\r\nof this salt pork and nothing else. One day called peaday I took the\r\ndrawer of our doctor’s chest (Dr. Hodges of Philadelphia) and went to\r\nthe galley, which was the cooking place, with my drawer for a soup dish.\r\nI held it under a large brass cock, the cook turned it. I received the\r\nallowance of my mess, and behold! Brown water, and fifteen floating\r\npeas--no peas on the bottom of my drawer, and this for six men’s\r\nallowance for 24 hours. The peas were all in the bottom of the kettle.\r\nThose left would be taken to New York and, I suppose, sold.\r\n\r\n“One day in the week, called pudding day, we would receive three pounds\r\nof damaged flour, in it would be green lumps such as their men would\r\nnot eat, and one pound of very bad raisins, one third raisin sticks. We\r\nwould pick out the sticks, mash the lumps of flour, put all with some\r\nwater into our drawer, mix our pudding and put it into a bag and boil\r\nit with a tally tied to it with the number of our mess. This was a day’s\r\nallowance. We, for some time, drew a half pint of rum for each man. One\r\nday Captain Lard (Laird) who commanded the ship Jersey, came on board.\r\nAs soon as he was on the main deck of the ship he cried out for the\r\nboatswain. The boatswain arrived and in a very quick motion, took off\r\nhis hat. There being on deck two half hogshead tubs where our allowance\r\nof rum was mixed into grog, Captain L., said, ‘Have the prisoners had\r\ntheir allowance of rum today?’ ‘No, sir’ answered the boatswain. Captain\r\nL. replied, ‘Damn your soul, you rascal, heave it overboard.’\r\n\r\n“The boatswain, with help, upset the tubs of rum on the middle deck. The\r\ngrog rum run out of the scuppers of the ship into the river. I saw no\r\nmore grog on board. * * * Every fair day a number of British officers\r\nand sergeants would come on board, form in two ranks on the quarter\r\ndeck, facing inwards, the prisoners in the after part of the quarter\r\ndeck. As the boatswain would call a name, the word would be ‘Pass!’ As\r\nthe prisoners passed between the ranks officers and sergeants stared\r\nthem in the face. This was done to catch deserters, and if they caught\r\nnothing the sergeants would come on the middle deck and cry out ‘Five\r\nguineas bounty to any man that will enter his Majesty’s service!’\r\n\r\n“Shortly after this party left the ship a Hessian party would come on\r\nboard, and the prisoners had to go through the same routine of duty\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n“From the Jersey prison ship eighty of us were taken to the pink stern\r\nsloop-of-war Hunter, Captain Thomas Henderson, Commander. We were taken\r\nthere in a large ship’s long boat, towed by a ten-oar barge, and one\r\nother barge with a guard of soldiers in the rear.\r\n\r\n“On board the ship Hunter we drew one third allowance, and every Monday\r\nwe received a loaf of wet bread, weighing seven pounds for each mess.\r\nThis loaf was from Mr. John Pintard’s father, of New York, the American\r\nCommissary, and this bread, with the allowance of provisions, we found\r\nsufficient to live on.\r\n\r\n“After we had been on board some time Mr. David Sproat, the British\r\nCommissary of prisoners, came on board; all the prisoners were ordered\r\naft; the roll was called and as each man passed him Mr. Sproat would\r\nask, ‘Are you a seaman?’ The answer was ‘Landsman, landsman.’ There were\r\nten landsmen to one answer of half seaman. When the roll was finished\r\nMr. Sproat said to our sea officers, ‘Gentlemen, how do you make out at\r\nsea, for the most part of you are landsmen?’\r\n\r\n“Our officers answered: ‘You hear often how we make out. When we meet\r\nour force, or rather more than our force we give a good account of\r\nthem.’\r\n\r\n“Mr. Sproat asked, ‘And are not your vessels better manned than these.\r\nOur officers replied, ‘Mr Sproat, we are the best manned out of the port\r\nof Philadelphia.’ Mr. Sproat shrugged his shoulders saying, ‘I cannot\r\nsee how you do it.’”\r\n\r\nWe do not understand what John Van Dyke meant by his expression “half\r\nseaman.” It is probable that the sailors among the prisoners pretended\r\nto be soldiers in order to be exchanged. There was much more difficulty\r\nin exchanging sailors than soldiers, as we shall see. David Sproat was\r\nthe British Commissary for Naval Prisoners alone. In a paper published\r\nin New York in April 28th, 1780, appears the following notice:--“I do\r\nhereby direct all Captains, Commanders, Masters, and Prize Masters\r\nof ships and other vessels, who bring naval prisoners into this port,\r\nimmediately to send a list of their names to this office, No. 33 Maiden\r\nLane, where they will receive an order how to dispose of them.\r\n\r\n“(Signed) David Sproat.”\r\n\r\nThe Jersey and some of the other prison ships often had landsmen among\r\ntheir prisoners, at least until the last years of the war, when they\r\nwere so overcrowded with sailors, that there must have been scant room\r\nfor any one else.\r\n\r\nThe next prisoner whose recollections we will consider is Captain Silas\r\nTalbot, who was confined on board the Jersey in the fall of 1780. He\r\nsays: “All her port holes were closed. * * * There were about 1,100\r\nprisoners on board. There were no berths or seats, to lie down on, not a\r\nbench to sit on. Many were almost without cloaths. The dysentery, fever,\r\nphrenzy and despair prevailed among them, and filled the place with\r\nfilth, disgust and horror. The scantiness of the allowance, the bad\r\nquality of the provisions, the brutality of the guards, and the\r\nsick, pining for comforts they could not obtain, altogether furnished\r\ncontinually one of the greatest scenes of human distress and misery\r\never beheld. It was now the middle of October, the weather was cool\r\nand clear, with frosty nights, so that the number of deaths per day was\r\n_reduced to an average of ten_, and this number was considered by the\r\nsurvivors a small one, when compared with the terrible mortality that\r\nhad prevailed for three months before. The human bones and skulls, yet\r\nbleaching on the shore of Long Island, and daily exposed, by the falling\r\ndown of the high bank on which the prisoners were buried, is a shocking\r\nsight, and manifestly demonstrates that the Jersey prison ship had been\r\nas destructive as a field of battle.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nTHE EXPERIENCE OF EBENEZER FOX\r\n\r\n\r\nEbenezer Fox, a prisoner on board the Jersey, wrote a little book\r\nabout his dreadful experiences when he was a very old man. The book\r\nwas written in 1838, and published by Charles Fox in Boston in 1848.\r\nEbenezer Fox was born in the East Parish of Roxbury, Mass., in 1763. In\r\nthe spring of 1775 he and another boy named Kelly ran away to sea.\r\nFox shipped as a cabin boy in a vessel commanded by Captain Joseph\r\nManchester.\r\n\r\nHe made several cruises and returned home. In 1779 he enlisted, going as\r\na substitute for the barber to whom he was apprenticed. His company was\r\ncommanded by Captain William Bird of Boston in a regiment under Colonel\r\nProctor. Afterwards he signed ship’s papers and entered the naval\r\nservice on a twenty gun ship called the Protector, Captain John F.\r\nWilliams of Massachusetts. On the lst of April, 1780, they sailed for\r\na six months cruise, and on the ninth of June, 1780, fought the Admiral\r\nDuff until she took fire and blew up. A short time afterwards the\r\nProtector was captured by two English ships called the Roebuck and\r\nMayday.\r\n\r\nFox concealed fifteen dollars in the crown of his hat, and fifteen more\r\nin the soles of his shoes.\r\n\r\nAll the prisoners were sent into the hold. One third of the crew of the\r\nProtector were pressed into the British service. The others were sent to\r\nthe Jersey. Evidently this prison ship had already become notorious, for\r\nFox writes: “The idea of being incarcerated in this floating pandemonium\r\nfilled us with horror, but the ideas we had formed of its horror fell\r\nfar short of the reality. * * * The Jersey was removed from the East\r\nRiver, and moored with chain cables at the Wallabout in consequence\r\nof the fears entertained that the sickness which prevailed among the\r\nprisoners might spread to the shore. * * * I now found myself in a\r\nloathsome prison, among a collection of the most wretched and disgusting\r\nlooking objects that I ever beheld in human form.\r\n\r\n“Here was a motley crew, covered with rags and filth; visages pallid\r\nwith disease; emaciated with hunger and anxiety; and hardly retaining a\r\ntrace of their original appearance. Here were men, who had once enjoyed\r\nlife while riding over the mountain wave or roaming through pleasant\r\nfields, full of health and vigor, now shrivelled by a scanty and\r\nunwholesome diet, ghastly with inhaling an impure atmosphere, exposed to\r\ncontagion; in contact with disease, and surrounded with the horrors of\r\nsickness, and death. Here, thought I, must I linger out the morning\r\nof my life” (he was seventeen) “in tedious days and sleepless nights,\r\nenduring a weary and degrading captivity, till death should terminate my\r\nsufferings, and no friend will know of my departure.\r\n\r\n“A prisoner on board the ‘Old Jersey!’ The very thought was appalling. I\r\ncould hardly realize my situation.\r\n\r\n“The first thing we found it necessary to do after our capture was to\r\nform ourselves into small parties called messes, consisting of six\r\nin each, as previous to doing this, we could obtain no food. All the\r\nprisoners were obliged to fast on the first day of their arrival, and\r\nseldom on the second could they obtain any food in season for cooking\r\nit. * * * All the prisoners fared alike; officers and sailors received\r\nthe same treatment on board of this old hulk. * * * We were all\r\n‘rebels.’ The only distinction known among us was made by the prisoners\r\nthemselves, which was shown in allowing those who had been officers\r\nprevious to their captivity, to congregate in the extreme afterpart of\r\nthe ship, and to keep it exclusively to themselves as their place of\r\nabode. * * * The prisoners were confined in the two main decks below.\r\nThe lowest dungeon was inhabited by those prisoners who were foreigners,\r\nand whose treatment was more severe than that of the Americans.\r\n\r\n“The inhabitants of this lower region were the most miserable and\r\ndisgusting looking objects that can be conceived. Daily washing in salt\r\nwater, together with their extreme emaciation, caused the skin to appear\r\nlike dried parchment. Many of them remained unwashed for weeks; their\r\nhair long, and matted, and filled with vermin; their beards never cut\r\nexcept occasionally with a pair of shears, which did not improve their\r\ncomeliness, though it might add to their comfort. Their clothes were\r\nmere rags, secured to their bodies in every way that ingenuity could\r\ndevise.\r\n\r\n“Many of these men had been in this lamentable condition for two years,\r\npart of the time on board other prison ships; and having given up all\r\nhope of ever being exchanged, had become resigned to their situation.\r\nThese men were foreigners whose whole lives had been one continual scene\r\nof toil, hardship, and suffering. Their feelings were blunted; their\r\ndispositions soured; they had no sympathies for the world; no home to\r\nmourn for; no friends to lament for their fate. But far different was\r\nthe condition of the most numerous class of prisoners, composed mostly\r\nof young men from New England, fresh from home.\r\n\r\n“They had reason to deplore the sudden change in their condition. * * *\r\nThe thoughts of home, of parents, brothers, sisters, and friends, would\r\ncrowd upon their minds, and brooding on what they had been, and what\r\nthey were, their desire for home became a madness. The dismal and\r\ndisgusting scene around; the wretched objects continually in sight;\r\nand ‘hope deferred which maketh the heart sick’, produced a state of\r\nmelancholy that often ended in death,--the death of a broken heart.”\r\n\r\nFox describes the food and drink, the prison regulations, deaths, and\r\nburials, just as they were described by Captain Dring, who wrote the\r\nfullest account of the Jersey, and from whose memoirs we shall\r\nquote further on. He says of their shallow graves in the sand of\r\nthe Wallabout: “This was the last resting place of many a son and a\r\nbrother,--young and noble-spirited men, who had left their happy homes\r\nand kind friends to offer their lives in the service of their country.\r\n* * * Poor fellows! They suffered more than their older companions\r\nin misery. They could not endure their hopeless and wearisome\r\ncaptivity:--to live on from day to day, denied the power of doing\r\nanything; condemned to that most irksome and heart-sickening of all\r\nsituations, utter inactivity; their restless and impetuous spirits,\r\nlike caged lions, panted to be free, and the conflict was too much\r\nfor endurance, enfeebled and worn out as they were with suffering and\r\nconfinement. * * * The fate of many of these unhappy victims must have\r\nremained forever unknown to their friends; for in so large a number,\r\nno exact account could be kept of those who died, and they rested in\r\na nameless grave; while those who performed the last sad rites were\r\nhurried away before their task was half completed, and forbid to express\r\ntheir horror and indignation at this insulting negligence towards the\r\ndead. * * *\r\n\r\n“The regular crew of the Jersey consisted of a Captain, two Mates, a\r\nsteward, a cook, and about twelve sailors. There was likewise on board\r\na guard of about thirty soldiers, from the different regiments quartered\r\non Long Island, who were relieved by a fresh party every week.\r\n\r\n“The physical force of the prisoners was sufficient at any time to take\r\npossession of the ship, but the difficulty was to dispose of themselves\r\nafter a successful attempt. Long Island was in possession of the\r\nBritish, and the inhabitants were favorable to the British cause. To\r\nleave the ship and land on the island, would be followed by almost\r\ncertain detection; and the miseries of our captivity would be increased\r\nby additional cruelties heaped upon us from the vindictive feelings of\r\nour oppressors.\r\n\r\n“Yet, small as was the chance for succeeding in the undertaking, the\r\nattempt to escape was often made, and in not a few instances with\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n“Our sufferings were so intolerable, that we felt it to be our duty to\r\nexpose ourselves to almost any risk to obtain our liberty. To remain\r\non board of the prison ship seemed to be certain death, and in its most\r\nhorrid form; to be killed, while endeavoring to get away, could be no\r\nworse.\r\n\r\n“American prisoners are proverbial for their ingenuity in devising ways\r\nand means to accomplish their plans, whether they be devised for their\r\nown comfort and benefit, or for the purpose of annoying and tormenting\r\ntheir keepers.\r\n\r\n“Although we were guarded with vigilance yet there did not appear much\r\nsystem in the management of the prisoners; for we frequently missed a\r\nwhole mess from our number, while their disappearance was not noticed by\r\nour keepers. Occasionally a few would be brought back who had been found\r\nin the woods upon Long Island, and taken up by the Tories.\r\n\r\n“Our mess one day noticed that the mess that occupied the place next to\r\nthem were among the missing. This circumstance led to much conjecture\r\nand inquiry respecting the manner in which they had effected their\r\nescape. By watching the movements of our neighbors we soon found out the\r\nprocess necessary to be adopted.\r\n\r\n“Any plan which a mess had formed they kept a secret among their\r\nnumber, in order to insure a greater prospect of success. * * * For\r\nthe convenience of the officers of the ship a closet, called the “round\r\nhouse”, had been constructed under the forecastle, the door of which was\r\nkept locked. This room was seldom used, there being other conveniences\r\nin the ship preferable to it.\r\n\r\n“Some of the prisoners had contrived to pick the lock of the door; and\r\nas it was not discovered the door remained unfastened.\r\n\r\n“After we had missed our neighbor prisoners, and had ascertained to our\r\nsatisfaction their mode of operation, the members of our mess determined\r\nto seize the first opportunity that offered to attempt our escape. We\r\nselected a day, about the 15th of August, and made all the preparations\r\nin our power for ensuring us success in our undertaking. At sunset, when\r\nthe usual cry from the officer of the guard, ‘Down, rebels, down!’ was\r\nheard, instead of following the multitude down the hatchways, our mess,\r\nconsisting of six, all Americans, succeeded in getting into the ‘round\r\nhouse’, except one. The round house was found too small to contain more\r\nthan five; and the sixth man, whose name, I think, was Putnam of Boston,\r\nconcealed himself under a large tub, which happened to be lying near the\r\nplace of our confinement. The situation of the five, as closely packed\r\nin the round house as we could stand and breathe, was so uncomfortable\r\nas to make us very desirous of vacating it as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n“We remained thus cooped up, hardly daring to breathe, for fear we\r\nshould be heard by the guard. The prisoners were all below, and no noise\r\nwas heard above, saving the tramp of the guard as he paced the deck. It\r\nwas customary, after the prisoners were secured below, for the ship’s\r\nmate every night to search above; this, however, was considered a mere\r\nformality, and the duty was very imperfectly executed. While we were\r\nanxiously awaiting the completion of this service, an event transpired,\r\nthat we little anticipated, and which led to our detection.\r\n\r\n“One of the prisoners, an Irishman, had made his arrangements to escape\r\nthe same evening, and had not communicated with any one on the subject\r\nexcept a countryman of his, whom he persuaded to bury him up in the coal\r\nhole, near the forecastle.\r\n\r\n“Whether his friend covered him faithfully or not, or whether the\r\nIrishman thought that if he could not see anybody, nobody could see him,\r\nor whether, feeling uncomfortable in his position, he turned over to\r\nrelieve himself, I know not; but when the mate looked in the coal\r\nhole he espied something rather whiter than the coal, which he soon\r\nascertained to be the Irishman’s shoulder. This discovery made the\r\nofficer suspicious, and induced him to make a more thorough search than\r\nusual.\r\n\r\n“We heard the uproar that followed the discovery, and the threats of the\r\nmate that he would search every damned corner. He soon arrived at the\r\nround house, and we heard him ask a soldier for the key. Our hopes\r\nand expectations were a little raised when we heard the soldier\r\nreply, ‘There is no need of searching this place, for the door is kept\r\nconstantly locked.’\r\n\r\n“But the mate was not to be diverted from his purpose, and ordered the\r\nsoldier to get the key.\r\n\r\n“During the absence of the soldier, we had a little time to reflect upon\r\nthe dangers of our situation; crowded together in a space so small as\r\nnot to admit of motion; with no other protection than the thickness of\r\na board; guarded on the outside by about twelve soldiers, armed with\r\ncutlasses, and the mate, considerably drunk, with a pistol in each hand,\r\nthreatening every moment to fire through;--our feelings may be\r\nmore easily conceived than described. There was but little time for\r\ndeliberation; something must be immediately done. * * * In a whispered\r\nconsultation of some moments, we conceived that the safest course\r\nwe could pursue would be to break out with all the violence we could\r\nexercise, overcome every obstacle, and reach the quarter-deck. By this\r\ntime the soldier had arrived with the key, and upon applying it, the\r\ndoor was found to be unlocked. We now heard our last summons from the\r\nmate, with imprecations too horrible to be repeated, and threatening us\r\nwith instant destruction if we did not immediately come out.\r\n\r\n“To remain any longer where we were would have been certain death to\r\nsome of us; we therefore carried our hastily formed plan into execution.\r\nThe door opened outwards, and forming ourselves into a solid body, we\r\nburst open the door, rushed out pellmell, and making a brisk use of our\r\nfists, knocked the guard heels over head in all directions, at the same\r\ntime running with all possible speed for the quarter-deck. As I rushed\r\nout, being in the rear, I received a wound from a cutlass on my side,\r\nthe scar of which remains to this day.\r\n\r\n“As nearly all the guards were prostrated by our unexpected sally, we\r\narrived at our destined place, without being pursued by anything but\r\ncurses and threats.\r\n\r\n“The mate exercised his authority to protect us from the rage of the\r\nsoldiers, who were in pursuit of us, as soon as they had recovered\r\nfrom the prostration into which they had been thrown; and, with the\r\nassistance of the Captain’s mistress, whom the noise had brought upon\r\ndeck, and whose sympathy was excited when she saw we were about to be\r\nmurdered: she placed herself between us and the enraged guard, and made\r\nsuch an outcry as to bring the Captain” (Laird) “up, who ordered\r\nthe guard to take their station at a little distance and to watch us\r\nnarrowly. We were all put in irons, our feet being fastened to a long\r\nbar, a guard placed over us, and in this situation we were left to pass\r\nthe night.\r\n\r\n“During the time of the transactions related, our fellow prisoner,\r\nPutnam, remained quietly under the tub, and heard the noise from his\r\nhiding place. He was not suffered to remain long in suspense. A soldier\r\nlifted up the tub, and seeing the poor prisoner, thrust his bayonet into\r\nhis body, just above his hip, and then drove him to the quarter-deck,\r\nto take his place in irons among us. The blood flowed profusely from\r\nhis wound, and he was soon after sent on board the hospital ship, and we\r\nnever heard anything respecting him afterwards.\r\n\r\n“With disappointed expectations we passed a dreary night. A cold\r\nfog, followed by rain, came on; to which we were exposed, without any\r\nblankets or covering to protect us from the inclemency of the weather.\r\nOur sufferings of mind and body during that horrible night, exceeded any\r\nthat I have ever experienced.\r\n\r\n“We were chilled almost to death, and the only way we could preserve\r\nheat enough in our bodies to prevent our perishing, was to lie upon each\r\nother by turns.\r\n\r\n“Morning at last came, and we were released from our fetters. Our limbs\r\nwere so stiff that we could hardly stand. Our fellow prisoners assisted\r\nus below, and wrapping us in blankets, we were at last restored to a\r\nstate of comparative comfort.\r\n\r\n“For attempting to escape we were punished by having our miserable\r\nallowance reduced one third in quantity for a month; and we had found\r\nthe whole of it hardly sufficient to sustain life. * * *\r\n\r\n“One day a boat came alongside containing about sixty firkins of grease,\r\nwhich they called butter. The prisoners were always ready to assist in\r\nthe performance of any labor necessary to be done on board of the ship,\r\nas it afforded some little relief to the tedious monotony of their\r\nlives. On this occasion they were ready to assist in hoisting the butter\r\non board. The firkins were first deposited upon the deck, and then\r\nlowered down the main hatchway. Some of the prisoners, who were the most\r\nofficious in giving their assistance, contrived to secrete a firkin,\r\nby rolling it forward under the forecastle, and afterwards carrying it\r\nbelow in their bedding.\r\n\r\n“This was considered as quite a windfall; and being divided among a few\r\nof us, proved a considerable luxury. It helped to fill up the pores\r\nin our mouldy bread, when the worms were dislodged, and gave to the\r\ncrumbling particles a little more consistency.\r\n\r\n“Several weeks after our unsuccessful attempt to escape, another one\r\nattended with better success, was made by a number of the prisoners.\r\nAt sunset the prisoners were driven below, and the main hatchway was\r\nclosed. In this there was a trap-door, large enough for a man to pass\r\nthrough, and a sentinel was placed over it with orders to permit one\r\nprisoner at a time to come up during the night.\r\n\r\n“The plan that had been formed was this:--one of the prisoners should\r\nascend, and dispose of the sentinel in such a manner that he should be\r\nno obstacle in the way of those who were to follow.\r\n\r\n“Among the soldiers was an Irishman who, in consequence of having a head\r\nof hair remarkable for its curly appearance, and withal a very crabbed\r\ndisposition, had been nicknamed ‘Billy the Ram’. He was the sentinel on\r\nduty this night, for one was deemed sufficient, as the prisoners were\r\nconsidered secure when they were below, having no other place of egress\r\nsaving the trap-door, over which the sentinel was stationed.\r\n\r\n“Late in the night one of the prisoners, a bold, athletic fellow,\r\nascended upon deck, and in an artful manner engaged the attention of\r\nBilly the Ram, in conversation respecting the war; lamenting that he had\r\nengaged in so unnatural a contest, expressing his intention of enlisting\r\nin the British service, and requesting Billy’s advice respecting the\r\ncourse necessary to be pursued to obtain the confidence of the officers.\r\n\r\n“Billy happened to be in a mood to take some interest in his views,\r\nand showed an inclination, quite uncommon for him, to prolong the\r\nconversation. Unsuspicious of any evil design on the part of the\r\nprisoner, and while leaning carelessly on his gun, Billy received a\r\ntremendous blow from the fist of his entertainer on the back of his\r\nhead, which brought him to the deck in a state of insensibility.\r\n\r\n“As soon as he was heard to fall by those below, who were anxiously\r\nawaiting the result of the friendly conversation of their pioneer with\r\nBilly, and were satisfied that the final knock-out argument had been\r\ngiven, they began to ascend, and, one after another, to jump overboard,\r\nto the number of about thirty.\r\n\r\n“The noise aroused the guard, who came upon deck, where they found Billy\r\nnot sufficiently recovered from the stunning effects of the blow he had\r\nreceived to give any account of the transaction. A noise was heard in\r\nthe water; but it was so dark that no object could be distinguished.\r\nThe attention of the guard, however, was directed to certain spots which\r\nexhibited a luminous appearance, which salt water is known to assume in\r\nthe night when it is agitated, and to these appearances they directed\r\ntheir fire, and getting out the boats, picked out about half the number\r\nthat attempted to escape, many of whom were wounded, though not one was\r\nkilled. The rest escaped.\r\n\r\n“During the uproar overhead the prisoners below encouraged the\r\nfugitives, and expressed their approbation of their proceedings in\r\nthree hearty cheers; for which gratification we suffered our usual\r\npunishment--a short allowance of our already short and miserable fare.\r\n\r\n“For about a fortnight after this transaction it would have been a\r\nhazardous experiment to approach near to ‘Billy the Ram’, and it was a\r\nlong time before we ventured to speak to him, and finally to obtain from\r\nhim an account of the events of the evening.\r\n\r\n“Not long after this another successful attempt to escape was made,\r\nwhich for its boldness is perhaps unparalleled in the history of such\r\ntransactions.\r\n\r\n“One pleasant morning about ten o’clock a boat came alongside,\r\ncontaining a number of gentlemen from New York, who came for the purpose\r\nof gratifying themselves with a sight of the miserable tenants of the\r\nprison-ship, influenced by the same kind of curiosity that induces some\r\npeople to travel a great distance to witness an execution.\r\n\r\n“The boat, which was a beautiful yawl, and sat like a swan upon the\r\nwater, was manned by four oarsmen, with a man at the helm. Considerable\r\nattention and respect was shown the visitors, the ship’s side being\r\nmanned when they showed their intention of coming on board, and the\r\nusual naval courtesies extended. The gentlemen were soon on board;\r\nand the crew of the yawl, having secured her to the forechains on the\r\nlarboard side of the ship, were permitted to ascend the deck.\r\n\r\n“A soldier as usual was pacing with a slow and measured tread the whole\r\nlength of the deck, wheeling round with measured precision, when he\r\narrived at the end of his walk; and whether upon this occasion, any one\r\ninterested in his movements had secretly slipped a guinea into his hand,\r\nnot to quicken but to retard his progress, was never known; but it was\r\nevident to the prisoners that he had never occupied so much time before\r\nin measuring the distance with his back to the place where the yawl was\r\nfastened.\r\n\r\n“At this time there were sitting in the forecastle, apparently admiring\r\nthe beautiful appearance of the yawl, four mates and a captain, who had\r\nbeen brought on board as prisoners a few days previous, taken in some\r\nvessel from a southern port.\r\n\r\n“As soon as the sentry had passed these men, in his straightforward\r\nmarch, they, in a very quiet manner, lowered themselves down into the\r\nyawl, cut the rope, and the four mates taking in hand the oars, while\r\nthe captain managed the helm, in less time than I have taken to describe\r\nit, they were under full sweep from the ship. They plied the oars with\r\nsuch vigor that every stroke they took seemed to take the boat out of\r\nthe water. In the meantime the sentry heard nothing and saw nothing of\r\nthis transaction, till he had arrived at the end of his march, when,\r\nin wheeling slowly round, he could no longer affect ignorance, or avoid\r\nseeing that the boat was several times its length from the ship.\r\nHe immediately fired; but, whether he exercised his best skill as a\r\nmarksman, or whether it was on account of the boat’s going ahead\r\nits whole length at every pull of the rowers, I could never exactly\r\nascertain, but the ball fell harmlessly into the water. The report of\r\nthe gun brought the whole guard out, who blazed away at the fugitives,\r\nwithout producing any dimunition in the rapidity of their progress.\r\n\r\n“By this time the officers of the ship were on deck with their visitors;\r\nand while all were gazing with astonishment at the boldness and\r\neffrontery of the achievement, the guard were firing as fast as they\r\ncould load their guns. When the prisoners gave three cheers to the\r\nyawl’s crew, as an expression of their joy at their success, the Captain\r\nordered all of us to be driven below at the point of the bayonet, and\r\nthere we were confined the remainder of the day.\r\n\r\n“These five men escaped, greatly to the mortification of the captain\r\nand officers of the prison-ship. After this, as long as I remained a\r\nprisoner, whenever any visitors came on board, all the prisoners were\r\ndriven below, where they were obliged to remain till the company had\r\ndeparted.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nTHE EXPERIENCE OF EBENEZER FOX (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe miseries of our condition were continually increasing. The\r\npestilence on board spread rapidly; and every day added to our bill of\r\nmortality. The young were its most frequent victims. The number of the\r\nprisoners was constantly augmenting, notwithstanding the frequent and\r\nsuccessful attempts to escape. When we were mustered and called upon to\r\nanswer to our names, and it was ascertained that nearly two hundred\r\nhad mysteriously disappeared, without leaving any information of their\r\ndeparture, the officers of the ship endeavored to make amends for\r\ntheir past remissness by increasing the rigor of our confinement, and\r\ndepriving us of all hope of adopting any of the means for liberating\r\nourselves from our cruel thralldom, so successfully practiced by many of\r\nour comrades.\r\n\r\n“With the hope that some relief might be obtained to meliorate the\r\nwretchedness of our situation, the prisoners petitioned General Clinton,\r\ncommanding the British forces in New York, for permission to send a\r\nmemorial to General Washington, describing our condition, and requesting\r\nhis influence in our behalf, that some exchange of prisoners might be\r\neffected.\r\n\r\n“Permission was obtained, and the memorial was sent. * * * General\r\nWashington wrote to Congress, and also to the British Commissary of\r\nNaval prisoners, remonstrating with him, deprecating the cruel treatment\r\nof the Americans, and threatening retaliation.\r\n\r\n“The long detention of American sailors on board of British prison-ships\r\nwas to be attributed to the little pains taken by our countrymen to\r\nretain British subjects who were taken prisoner on the ocean during the\r\nwar. Our privateers captured many British seamen, who, when willing to\r\nenlist in our service, as was generally the case, were received on board\r\nof our ships. Those who were brought into port were suffered to go at\r\nlarge; for in the impoverished condition of the country, no state\r\nor town was willing to subject itself to the expence of maintaining\r\nprisoners in a state of confinement; they were permitted to provide for\r\nthemselves. In this way the number of British seamen was too small for\r\na regular and equal exchange. Thus the British seamen, after their\r\ncapture, enjoyed the blessings of liberty, the light of the sun, and the\r\npurity of the atmosphere, while the poor American sailors were compelled\r\nto drag out a miserable existence amid want and distress, famine and\r\npestilence. As every principle of justice and humanity was disregarded\r\nby the British in their treatment of the prisoners, so likewise was\r\nevery moral and legal right violated in compelling them to enter into\r\ntheir service.\r\n\r\n“We had obtained some information in relation to an expected draught\r\nthat would soon be made upon the prisoners to fill up a complement of\r\nmen that were wanted for the service of his Majesty’s fleet.\r\n\r\n“One day in the last part of August our fears for the dreaded event were\r\nrealized. A British officer with a number of soldiers came on board. The\r\nprisoners were all ordered on deck, placed on the larboard gangway, and\r\nmarched in single file round to the quarter-deck, where the officers\r\nstood to inspect them, and select such ones as suited their fancies\r\nwithout any reference to the rights of the prisoners. * * * We continued\r\nto march round in solemn and melancholy processsion, till they had\r\nselected from among our number about three hundred of the ablest, nearly\r\nall of whom were Americans, and they were directed to go below under a\r\nguard, to collect together whatever things they wished to take belonging\r\nto them. They were then driven into the boats, waiting alongside, and\r\nleft the prison ship, not to enjoy their freedom, but to be subjected\r\nto the iron despotism, and galling slavery of a British man-of-war; to\r\nwaste their lives in a foreign service; and toil for masters whom they\r\nhated. Such, however, were the horrors of our situation as prisoners,\r\nand so small was the prospect of relief, that we almost envied the lot\r\nof those who left the ship to go into the service of the enemy.\r\n\r\n“That the reader may not think I have given an exaggerated account of\r\nour sufferings on board the Jersey, I will here introduce some facts\r\nrelated in the histories of the Revolutionary War. I introduce them as\r\nan apology for the course that I and many of my fellow citizens adopted\r\nto obtain temporary relief from our sufferings.\r\n\r\n“The prisoners captured by Sir William Howe in 1776 amounted to several\r\nthousands. * * * The privates were confined in prisons, deserted\r\nchurches, and other large open buildings, entirely unfit for the\r\nhabitations of human beings, in severe winter weather, without any of\r\nthe most ordinary comforts of life.\r\n\r\n“To the indelible and everlasting disgrace of the British name, these\r\nunfortunate victims of a barbarity more befitting savages than gentlemen\r\nbelonging to a nation boasting itself to be the most enlightened and\r\ncivilized of the world,--many hundreds of them, perished from want of\r\nproper food and attention.\r\n\r\n“The cruelty of their inhuman jailors was not terminated by the death\r\nof these wretched men, as so little care was taken to remove the corpses\r\nthat seven dead bodies have been seen at one time lying in one of\r\nthe buildings in the midst of their living fellow-prisoners, who were\r\nperhaps envying them their release from misery. Their food * * * was\r\ngenerally that which was rejected by the British ships as unfit to be\r\neaten by the sailors, and unwholesome in the highest degree, as well as\r\ndisgusting in taste and appearance.\r\n\r\n“In December, 1776, the American board of war, after procuring such\r\nevidence as convinced them of the truth of their statements, reported\r\nthat: ‘There were 900 privates and 300 officers of the American army,\r\nprisoners in the city of New York, and 500 privates and 50 officers in\r\nPhiladelphia. That since the beginning of October, all these officers\r\nand privates had been confined in prisons or in the provost. That, from\r\nthe best evidence the subject could admit of, the general allowance of\r\nthe prisoners did not exceed four ounces of meat a day, and that often\r\nso damaged as to be uneatable. That it had been a common practice of the\r\nBritish to keep their prisoners four or five days without a morsel of\r\nmeat and thus tempt them to enlist to save their lives.’\r\n\r\n“Many were actually starved to death, in hope of making them enroll\r\nthemselves in the British army. The American sailors when captured\r\nsuffered even more than the soldiers, for they were confined on board\r\nprison ships in great numbers, and in a manner which showed that the\r\nBritish officers were willing to treat fellow beings, whose only crime\r\nwas love of liberty, worse than the vilest animals; and indeed in every\r\nrespect, with as much cruelty as is endured by the miserable inhabitants\r\nof the worst class of slave ships. * * * In the course of the war it has\r\nbeen asserted on good evidence, that 11,000 prisoners died on board the\r\nJersey. * * * These unfortunate beings died in agony in the midst of\r\ntheir fellow sufferers, who were obliged to witness their tortures,\r\nwithout the power of relieving their dying countrymen, even by cooling\r\ntheir parched lips with a drop of cold water, or a breath of fresh air;\r\nand, when the last breath had left the emaciated body, they sometimes\r\nremained for hours in close contact with the corpse, without room to\r\nshrink from companions that Death had made so horrible, and when at\r\nlast the dead were removed, they were sent in boats to the shore, and\r\nso imperfectly buried that long after the war was ended, their bones lay\r\nwhitening in the sun on the beach of Long Island, a lasting memorial of\r\nBritish cruelty, so entirely unwarranted by all the laws of war or even\r\ncommon humanity.\r\n\r\n“They could not even pretend that they were retaliating, for the\r\nAmericans invariably treated their prisoners with kindness, and as\r\nthough they were fellow men. All the time that these cruelties were\r\nperformed those who were deprived of every comfort and necessary were\r\nconstantly entreated to leave the American service, and induced to\r\nbelieve, while kept from all knowledge of public affairs, that the\r\nrepublican cause was hopeless; that all engaged in it would meet the\r\npunishment of traitors to the king, and that all their prospect of\r\nsaving their lives, or escaping from an imprisonment worse than death to\r\nyoung and high-spirited men, as most of them were, would be in joining\r\nthe British army, where they would be sure of good pay and quick\r\npromotion.\r\n\r\n“These were the means employed by our enemies to increase their own\r\nforces, and discourage the patriots, and it is not strange they were\r\nsuccessful in many instances. High sentiments of honor could not well\r\nexist in the poor, half-famished prisoners, who were denied even water\r\nto quench their thirst, or the privilege of breathing fresh, pure air,\r\nand cramped, day after day, in a space too small to admit of exercising\r\ntheir weary limbs, with the fear of wasting their lives in a captivity,\r\nwhich could not serve their country, nor gain honor to themselves.\r\n\r\n“But worse than all was the mortifying consideration that, after they\r\nhad suffered for the love of their country, more than sailors in active\r\nservice, they might die in these horrible places, and be laid with their\r\ncountrymen on the shores of Long Island, or some equally exposed spot,\r\nwithout the rites of burial, and their names never be heard of by those\r\nwho, in future ages, would look back to the roll of patriots, who\r\ndied in defence of liberty, with admiration and respect, while, on the\r\ncontrary, by dissembling for a time, they might be able to regain a\r\nplace in the service so dear to them, and in which they were ready to\r\nendure any hardship or encounter any danger.\r\n\r\n“Of all the prisons, on land or water, for the confinement of the\r\nAmericans, during the Revolutionary War, the Old Jersey was acknowledged\r\nto be the worst; such an accumulation of horrors was not to be found in\r\nany other one, or perhaps in all collectively.\r\n\r\n“The very name of it struck terror into the sailor’s heart, and caused\r\nhim to fight more desperately, to avoid being made a captive. Suffering\r\nas we did, day after day, with no prospect of relief, our numbers\r\ncontinually augmenting, * * * can it be thought strange that the younger\r\npart of the prisoners, to whom confinement seemed worse than death,\r\nshould be tempted to enlist into the British service; especially when,\r\nby so doing, it was probable that some opportunity would be offered\r\nto desert? We were satisfied that death would soon put an end to our\r\nsufferings if we remained prisoners much longer, yet when we discussed\r\nthe expediency of seeking a change in our condition, which we were\r\nsatisfied could not be worse under any circumstances, and it was\r\nproposed that we should enter the service of King George, our minds\r\nrevolted at the idea, and we abandoned the intention.\r\n\r\n“In the midst of our distresses, perplexities, and troubles of this\r\nperiod, we were not a little puzzled to know how to dispose of the\r\nvermin that would accumulate upon our persons, notwithstanding all our\r\nattempts at cleanliness. To catch them was a very easy task, but to\r\nundertake to deprive each individual captive of life, as rapidly as they\r\ncould have been taken, would have been a more herculean task for each\r\nindividual daily, than the destruction of 3000 Philistines by Sampson of\r\nold. To throw them overboard would have been but a small relief, as they\r\nwould probably add to the impurities of the boiler, by being deposited\r\nin it the first time it was filled up for cooking our unsavory mess.\r\nWhat then was to be done with them? A general consultation was held, and\r\nit was determined to deprive them of their liberty. This being agreed\r\nupon, the prisoners immediately went to work, for their comfort and\r\namusement, to make a liberal contribution of those migratory creatures,\r\nwho were compelled to colonize for a time within the boundaries of a\r\nlarge snuff box appropriated for the purpose. There they lay, snugly\r\nensconced, of all colors, ages, and sizes, to the amount of some\r\nhundreds, waiting for orders.\r\n\r\n“British recruiting officers frequently came on board, and held out to\r\nthe prisoners tempting offers to enlist in his Majesty’s service; not\r\nto fight against their own country, but to perform garrison duty in the\r\nisland of Jamaica.\r\n\r\n“One day an Irish officer came on board for this purpose, and not\r\nmeeting with much success among the prisoners who happened to be on\r\ndeck, he descended below to repeat his offers. He was a remarkably tall\r\nman, and was obliged to stoop as he passed along between decks. The\r\nprisoners were disposed for a frolic, and kept the officer in their\r\ncompany for some time, flattering him with expectations, till he\r\ndiscovered their insincerity, and left them in no very pleasant humor.\r\nAs he passed along, bending his body and bringing his broad shoulders to\r\nnearly a horizontal position, the idea occurred to our minds to furnish\r\nhim with some recruits from the colony in the snuff box. A favorable\r\nopportunity presented, the cover of the box was removed, and the whole\r\ncontents discharged upon the red-coated back of the officer. Three\r\ncheers from the prisoners followed the migration, and the officer\r\nascended to the deck, unconscious of the number and variety of the\r\nrecruits he had obtained without the formality of an enlistment. The\r\ncaptain of the ship, suspecting that some joke had been practised, or\r\nsome mischief perpetrated, from the noise below, met the officer at the\r\nhead of the gangway, and seeing the vermin crawling up his shoulders,\r\nand aiming at his head, with the instinct peculiar to them, exclaimed,\r\n‘Hoot mon! what’s the maitter wi’ your back!’ * * * By this time many of\r\nthem in their wanderings, had travelled from the rear to the front, and\r\nshowed themselves, to the astonishment of the officer. He flung off his\r\ncoat, in a paroxysm of rage, which was not allayed by three cheers from\r\nthe prisoners on deck. Confinement below, with a short allowance, was\r\nour punishment for this gratification.\r\n\r\n“From some information we had obtained we were in daily expectation of a\r\nvisit from the British recruiting officers, and from the summary method\r\nof their procedure, no one felt safe from the danger of being forced\r\ninto their service. Many of the prisoners thought it would be better\r\nto enlist voluntarily, as it was probable that afterwards they would be\r\npermitted to remain on Long Island, preparatory to their departure to\r\nthe West Indies, and during that time some opportunity would be offered\r\nfor their escape to the Jersey shore. * * * Soon after we had formed\r\nthis desperate resolve a recruiting officer came on board to enlist\r\nmen for the 88th Regiment to be stationed at Kingston, in the island\r\nof Jamaica. * * * The recruiting officer presented his papers for our\r\nsignature. We hesitated, we stared at each other, and felt we were about\r\nto do a deed of which we were ashamed, and which we might regret. Again\r\nwe heard the tempting offers, and again the assurance that we should not\r\nbe called upon to fight against our government or country, and with the\r\nhope that we should find an opportunity to desert, of which it was\r\nour firm intention to avail ourselves when offered,--with such hopes,\r\nexpectations, and motives, we signed the papers, and became soldiers in\r\nhis Majesty’s service,\r\n\r\n“How often did we afterwards lament that we had ever lived to see this\r\nhour? How often did we regret that we were not in our wretched prison\r\nship again, or buried in the sand at the Wallabout!”\r\n\r\nThere were twelve of the prisoners who left the Jersey with Ebenezer\r\nFox. They were at first taken to Long Island and lodged in barns, but\r\nso vigilantly were they guarded that they found it impossible to escape.\r\nThey were all sent to Kingston, and Fox was allowed to resume his\r\noccupation as a barber, much patronized by the officers stationed at\r\nthat post. He was soon allowed the freedom of the city, and furnished\r\nwith a pass to go about it as much as he wished. At last, in company\r\nwith four other Americans, he escaped, and after many adventures the\r\nparty succeeded in reaching Cuba, by means of a small sailing boat which\r\nthey pressed into service for that purpose. From Cuba they took passage\r\nin a small vessel for St. Domingo, and dropped anchor at Cape Francois,\r\nafterwards called Cape Henri. There they went on board the American\r\nfrigate, Flora, of 32 guns, commanded by Captain Henry Johnson, of\r\nBoston.\r\n\r\nThe vessel soon sailed for France and took several prizes. It finally\r\nwent up the Garonne to Bordeaux, where it remained nine months. In the\r\nharbor of Bordeaux were about six hundred vessels bearing the flags of\r\nvarious nations. Here they remained until peace was proclaimed, when Fox\r\nprocured service on board an American brig lying at Nantes, and set sail\r\nfor home in April, 1783.\r\n\r\nAt length he again reached his mother’s house at Roxbury, after an\r\nabsence of about three years. His mother, at first, did not recognize\r\nhim. She entertained him as a stranger, until he made himself known, and\r\nthen her joy was great, for she had long mourned him as lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nTHE CASE OF CHRISTOPHER HAWKINS\r\n\r\n\r\nChristopher Hawkins was born in Providence, Rhode Island, in 1764. When\r\nhe was in his thirteenth year he sailed on board an American privateer\r\nas a cabin boy. The privateer was a schooner, called the Eagle,\r\ncommanded by Captain Potter. Taken prisoner by the British, Hawkins was\r\nsent on board the Asia, an old transport ship, but was soon taken off\r\nthis vessel, then used for the confinement of American prisoners, and\r\nsent on board a frigate, the Maidstone, to serve as a waiter to the\r\nBritish officers on board. He remained on board the Maidstone a year.\r\nAt the end of that time he was allowed a good deal of liberty. He and\r\nanother boy were sent on shore to New York with a message, managed to\r\nelude the sentinels, and escaped first to Long Island, and afterwards\r\nreturned home to Providence.\r\n\r\nAbout 1781 he again went on board a privateer under Captain Whipple, was\r\nagain captured, and this time he was sent to the Jersey. He describes\r\nthe condition of the prisoners on their way in a transport to this\r\nfearful prison ship. They were so crowded together that they could\r\nscarcely move, yet they all joined in singing a patriotic song every\r\nstanza of which ended with the words:\r\n\r\n“For America and all her sons forever will shine!”\r\n\r\nThey were on board this transport three or four days unable to sit or\r\nlie down for want of room. When at last they reached the Jersey they\r\nfound 800 prisoners on board. Many of these poor wretches would become\r\nsick in the night and die before day. Hawkins was obliged to lie down to\r\nrest only twenty feet from the gangway, and in the path of the prisoners\r\nwho would run over him to get on the upper deck. He describes the\r\ncondition of these men as appalling.\r\n\r\n“Near us,” he writes, “was a guard ship and hospital ship, and along the\r\nshore a line of sentinels at regular intervals.”\r\n\r\nYet he determined to escape. Many did so; and many were murdered in the\r\nattempt. A mess of six had just met a dreadful fate. One of them became\r\nterrified and exclaimed as soon as he touched the water, “O Lord, I\r\nshall be drowned!” The guard turned out, and murdered five of the poor\r\nwretches. The sixth managed to hide, and held on by the flukes of the\r\nanchor with nothing but his nose above water. Early in the morning he\r\nclimbed up the anchor over the bow of the ship to the forecastle, and\r\nfled below. A boy named Waterman and Hawkins determined to drop through\r\na port-hole, and endeavor to reach Long Island by swimming. He thus\r\ndescribes the adventure:\r\n\r\n“The thunder-storm was opportune to our design, for having previously\r\nobtained from the cook’s room an old axe and crow-bar from the upper\r\ndeck for the purpose, we concealed them till an opportunity should offer\r\nfor their use. We took advantage of the peals of thunder in a storm that\r\ncame over us in the afternoon to break one of the gun ports on the lower\r\ndeck, which was strongly barred with iron and bolts. * * * When a peal\r\nof thunder roared we worked with all our might with the axe and crow-bar\r\nagainst the bars and bolts. When the peals subsided we ceased, without\r\nour blows being heard by the British, until another peal commenced. We\r\nthen went to work again, and so on, until our work was completed to\r\nour liking. The bars and bolts, after we had knocked them loose, were\r\nreplaced so as not to draw the attention of our British gentry if they\r\nshould happen to visit the lower deck before our departure. We also hung\r\nsome old apparel over and around the shattered gunport to conceal any\r\nmarks.\r\n\r\n“Being thus and otherwise prepared for our escape, the ship was visited\r\nby our Captain Whipple the next day after we had broken the gun-port. To\r\nhim we communicated our intention and contemplated means of escape. He\r\nstrongly remonstrated against the design. We told him we should start\r\nthe ensuing evening. Captain Whipple answered:\r\n\r\n“‘How do you think of escaping?’\r\n\r\n“I answered, ‘By swimming to that point,’ at the same time pointing to a\r\nplace then in our view on Long Island, in a northeasterly direction\r\nfrom the prison ship. We must do this to avoid the sentinels who were\r\nstationed in the neighborhood of the ship.\r\n\r\n“‘What!’ said Captain Whipple, ‘Do you think of swimming to that point?’\r\n\r\n“‘Yes, we must, to avoid the sentinels,’ I answered.\r\n\r\n“‘Well,’ said Captain Whipple, ‘Give it up, It is only throwing your\r\nlives away, for there is not a man on earth who can swim from this ship\r\nto that point as cold as the water is now. Why, how far do you think it\r\nis?’\r\n\r\n“‘Why,’ I answered, ‘Waterman and myself have estimated the distance at\r\na mile and a half.’\r\n\r\n“‘Yes,’ said he, ‘It’s all of two and a half miles. You cannot measure\r\nacross as well as I can. So you had better give it up, for I have\r\nencouragement of getting home next week, and if I do, I will make it my\r\nwhole business to get you all exchanged immediately.’\r\n\r\n“Altho’ Waterman was several years my senior in age, the conversation\r\nwas carried on between Captain Whipple and myself for the reason that\r\nCaptain W. was more acquainted with me than with Waterman, but Waterman\r\nwas present.” (Captain Whipple was captured five times during the\r\nRevolution, each time on his own vessel.)\r\n\r\n“His advice had great weight on our minds, but did not shake our\r\npurpose. We had not been on board the Old Jersey more than one hour\r\nbefore we began to plot our escape. We had been only three days on board\r\nwhen we left it forever. We had been on board long enough to discover\r\nthe awful scenes which took place daily in this ‘floating hell.’\r\n\r\n“Our preparations for leaving were completed by procuring a piece of\r\nrope from an old cable that was stretched under the fo’castle of the\r\nship, * * * and wound around the cable to preserve it. We had each of us\r\npacked our wearing apparel in a knapsack for each, made on board the\r\nOld Jersey. I gave some of my apparel to the two Smiths. I stowed in\r\nmy knapsack a thick woolen sailor jacket, well lined, a pair of thick\r\npantaloons, one vest, a pair of heavy silver shoe buckles, two silk\r\nhandkerchiefs, four silver dollars, not forgetting a junk bottle of rum,\r\nwhich we had purchased on board at a dear rate. Waterman had stowed his\r\napparel and other articles in his knapsack. Mine was very heavy. It\r\nwas fastened to my back with two very strong garters, passing over my\r\nshoulders, and under each arm, and fastened with a string to my breast,\r\nbringing my right and left garter in contact near the centre.\r\n\r\n“Thus equipt we were ready to commit ourselves to the watery element,\r\nand to our graves, as many of our hardy fellow prisoners predicted.\r\nThe evening was as good an one as we could desire at that season of the\r\nyear, the weather was mild and hazy, and the night extremely dark.\r\n\r\n“It was arranged between Waterman and myself that after leaving the ship\r\nwe should be governed in our course by the lights on board the ships and\r\nthe responses of the sentinels on shore, and after arriving on shore to\r\nrepair near a dwelling house which we could see from the Old Jersey in\r\nthe day time, and spend the balance of the night in a barn, but a few\r\nrods from the dwelling.\r\n\r\n“Waterman was the first to leave the ship through the broken-open\r\ngun-port, and suspended to the rope by his hands, and at the end behind\r\nhim (it was held) by several of our fellow prisoners whom we were\r\nleaving behind us, and with whom we affectionately parted with\r\nreciprocal good wishes. He succeeded in gaining the water and in leaving\r\nthe ship without discovery from the British. It had been agreed, if\r\ndetection was about to take place, that he should be received again into\r\nthe ship. I had agreed to follow him in one minute in the same manner.\r\nI left and followed in half that time, and succeeded in leaving the ship\r\nwithout giving the least alarm to those who had held us in captivity.\r\n\r\n“I kept along close to the side of the ship until I gained the stern,\r\nand then left the ship. This was all done very slowly, sinking my body\r\nas deep in the water as possible, without stopping my course, until I\r\nwas at such a distance from her that my motions in the water would not\r\ncreate attention from those on board. After gaining a suitable distance\r\nfrom the ship, I hailed Waterman three times. He did not answer me. *\r\n* * I have never seen him since he left the Old Jersey to this day. His\r\nfate and success I have since learned from James Waterman, one of his\r\nbrothers.\r\n\r\n“In the meantime I kept on my course without thinking that any accident\r\nwould befall him, as I knew him to be an excellent swimmer, and no\r\nfainthearted or timid fellow.\r\n\r\n“I could take my course very well from the light reflected from the\r\nstern lanthorns of the prison, guards, and hospital ships, and also from\r\nthe responses of the sentinels on shore; in the words, ‘All’s well.’\r\nThese responses were repeated every half hour on board the guard ship,\r\nand by the sentinels. * * * These repetitions served me to keep the time\r\nI was employed in reaching the shore;--no object occupied my mind during\r\nthis time so much as my friend Waterman, if I may except my own success\r\nin getting to land in safety.\r\n\r\n“I flattered myself I should find him on shore or at the barn we had\r\nagreed to occupy after we might gain it. After I had been swimming\r\nnearly or quite two hours my knapsack had broken loose from my back,\r\nfrom the wearing off of the garters under my arms, in consequence of the\r\nfriction in swimming. * * * This occurrence did not please me much. I\r\nendeavored to retain my knapsack by putting it under one arm, * * *\r\nbut soon found that this impeded my progress, and led me from my true\r\ncourse. * * * By this time I had become much chilled, and benumbed from\r\ncold, but could swim tolerably well. * * * I hesitated whether or not to\r\nretain my knapsack longer in my possession, or part from it forever,\r\nI soon determined on the latter, and sent it adrift. In this balancing\r\nstate of mind and subsequent decision I was cool and self collected as\r\nperhaps at any time in my life. * * * I now soon found I was close in\r\nwith the shore. * * * I swam within twelve feet of the shore before I\r\ncould touch bottom, and in so doing I found I could not stand, I was\r\nso cold * * * but I moved around in shoal water until I found I could\r\nstand, then stept on shore. * * * I had not sent my clothes adrift\r\nmore than twenty-five minutes or so before striking the shore. I was\r\ncompletely naked except for a small hat on my head which I had brought\r\nfrom the Old Jersey. What a situation was this, without covering to hide\r\nmy naked body, in an enemy’s country, without food or means to obtain\r\nany, and among Tories more unrelenting than the devil,--more perils to\r\nencounter and nothing to aid me but the interposition of heaven! Yet\r\nI had gained an important portion of my enterprise: I had got on land,\r\nafter swimming in the water two hours and a half, and a distance of\r\nperhaps two miles and a half.”\r\n\r\nHawkins at last found the barn and slept in it the rest of the night,\r\nbut not before falling over a rock in the darkness, and bruising his\r\nnaked body severely. Next morning a black girl came into the barn,\r\napparently hunting for eggs, but he did not dare reveal himself to her.\r\nHe remained there all day, and endeavored to milk the cows, but they\r\nwere afraid of a naked stranger. He left the place in the night and\r\ntravelled east. In a field he found some overripe water melons, but they\r\nwere neither wholesome nor palatable. After wandering a long time in the\r\nrain he came to another barn, and in it he slept soundly until late the\r\nnext day. Nearly famished he again wandered on and found in an orchard\r\na few half rotten pears. Near by was a potato patch which he entered\r\nhoping to get some of them. Here a young woman, who had been stooping\r\ndown digging potatoes, started up. “I was, of course,” he continues,\r\n“naked, my head excepted. She was, or appeared to be, excessively\r\nfrightened, and ran towards a house, screeching and screaming at every\r\nstep.” Hawkins ran in the other direction, and got safely away. At last\r\nthe poor boy found another barn, and lay, that night, upon a heap of\r\nflax. After sunrise next morning he concluded to go on his way. “I could\r\nsee the farmers at their labor in the fields. I then concluded to still\r\nkeep on my course, and go to some of these people then in sight. I was,\r\nby this time, almost worn out with hunger. I slowly approached two tall\r\nyoung men who were gathering garden sauce. They soon discovered me and\r\nappeared astonished at my appearance, and began to draw away from me,\r\nbut I spoke to them in the following words:--‘Don’t be afraid of me: I\r\nam a human being!’ They then made a halt and inquired of me, ‘Are\r\nyou scared?’ ‘No,’ said I. They then advanced slowly towards me, and\r\ninquired, ‘How came you here naked?’\r\n\r\n“I seated myself on the ground and told them the truth.”\r\n\r\nOne of the young men told him to conceal himself from the sight of the\r\nneighbors, and he would go and consult with his mother what had best be\r\ndone. He soon returned, bringing two large pieces of bread and butter\r\nand a decent pair of pantaloons. He then told him to go to the side of\r\nthe barn and wait there for his mother, but not to allow himself to be\r\nseen. The boys’ mother came out to speak to him with a shirt on her arm.\r\nAs he incautiously moved around the side of the barn to meet her, she\r\nexclaimed, “For God’s sake don’t let that black woman see you!” A slave\r\nwas washing clothes near the back door of the farm house. The poor woman\r\nexplained to Hawkins that this negress would betray him, “For she is as\r\nbig a devil as any of the king’s folks, and she will bring me out, and\r\nthen we should all be put in the provost and die there, for my husband\r\nwas put there more than two years ago, and rotted and died there not\r\nmore than two weeks since.”\r\n\r\nThe poor woman wept as she told her story, and the escaped prisoner wept\r\nwith her. This woman and her two sons were Dutch, and their house was\r\nonly nine miles from Brooklyn ferry. She now directed the boy to a house\r\nat Oyster Bay where she said there was a man who would assist him to\r\nescape.\r\n\r\nAfter running many risks he found the house at last, but the woman\r\nwho answered his knock told him that her husband was away and when he\r\nexplained who he was she became very angry, and said that it was her\r\nduty to give him up. So he ran away from her, and at last fell into the\r\nhands of a party of British, who recaptured him, and declared that they\r\nwould send him immediately back to the prison ship. They were quartered\r\nin a house near Oyster Bay, and here they locked him in a room, and he\r\nwas told to lie down on some straw to sleep, as it was now night. In\r\nthe night the fleas troubled him so much that he was very restless. A\r\nsentinel had been placed to guard him, and when this wretch heard him\r\nmoving in the dark he exclaimed, “Lie still, G--d---you,” and pricked\r\nhim several times with his bayonet, so that the poor boy felt the fresh\r\nblood running down his body. He begged the sentinel to spare his life,\r\ndeclaring that it was hard he should be killed merely because the fleas\r\nhad made him restless. He now did not dare to move, and was obliged to\r\nendure the attacks the fleas and the stiffness of his wounds in perfect\r\nsilence until the sentinel was relieved. The next sentinel was kind and\r\nhumane and seemed to compassionate his sufferings. He said that some\r\nmen were natural brutes, and seemed to take an interest in the boy, but\r\ncould do little for him. At daylight he was sent to the quarters of a\r\nTory colonel a mile from the guard room. The colonel was a tall man of\r\nfine appearance, who examined him, and then said he must be sent back to\r\nthe Jersey. The poor lad was now left in an unlocked room on the ground\r\nfloor of the colonel’s house. He was given his breakfast, and a mulatto\r\nman was set to guard him. Now there was a pantry opening into this room,\r\nand a negro girl, who appeared very friendly with the mulatto, called\r\nhim to eat his breakfast in this pantry. The mulatto, while eating,\r\nwould look out every few minutes. Just after one of these inspections\r\nthe boy got up softly, with his shoes in his hands, stepped across the\r\nroom, out at the back door, and concealed himself in a patch of standing\r\nhemp. From thence he made his way into an orchard, and out into a wood\r\nlot. Here he hid himself and remained quiet for several hours, and\r\nalthough he heard several persons talking near him, he was not pursued.\r\nAt last he stole out, walked about six miles, and at night fall entered\r\na barn and slept there. He was in rather better case than before his\r\nrecapture, for a doctor belonging to the British service had taken pity\r\non him the night before, and had furnished him with warm clothes, shoes,\r\nand a little money.\r\n\r\nNext morning a woman who lived in a small house near the road gave him\r\nsome bread and milk. The time of the year was autumn, it was a day or\r\ntwo before Cornwallis’s surrender at Yorktown. He now very fortunately\r\nmet an acquaintance named Captain Daniel Havens. He was an uncle of a\r\nboy named John Sawyer, with whom young Hawkins had run away from New\r\nYork some years before. Through the agency of this old friend Hawkins\r\ngot on board a smuggler in the night and finally reached home in safety.\r\n\r\nChristopher Hawkins’s account of the Old Jersey is not so reliable as\r\nthat of some others who were among her inmates. He was only on board\r\nthat vessel three days, but in that time he saw enough to decide him\r\nto risk death in the attempt to escape rather than remain any longer on\r\nboard of her. He declares that: “The cruel and unjustifiable treatment\r\nof the prisoners by the British soon produced the most demoralizing\r\neffects upon them. Boxing was tolerated without stint.... After I left\r\nthe ship an American vessel came into the port of New York as a cartel\r\nfor the exchange of prisoners.... A ship’s mate was so fortunate as\r\nto be one of the exchanged. He had a large chest on board, and, as\r\nprivately as he could, he put the cabin boy into the chest, locked him\r\nin, and carried him on board the cartel. A prisoner named Spicer had\r\nseen the boy put into the chest, and after he had been conveyed on board\r\nthe cartel, Spicer communicated the affair to the commanding officer on\r\nboard the Jersey. The cartel was immediately boarded, as she had not yet\r\nleft the port, and the boy was found and brought back. Spicer paid\r\nfor his treachery with his life. The prisoners knocked him down the\r\nhatchway, when they were going down for the night; they then fell upon\r\nhim, cut off his ears, and mangled him in a shocking manner, so that he\r\ndied in a day or two.”\r\n\r\nThis event occured after he left the ship, according to his own\r\nnarrative. The same story is told in a different way by an eye witness\r\nof undoubted veracity. He says that the prisoners were so incensed\r\nagainst Spicer that they determined to kill him. For this purpose some\r\nof them held him, while another was about to cut his throat, when the\r\nguards, hearing the uproar, rushed down the hatchway, and rescued him.\r\n\r\nHawkins also says: “I one day observed a prisoner on the forecastle of\r\nthe ship, with his shirt in his hands, having stripped it from his body,\r\ndeliberately picking the vermin from the pleats and putting them in his\r\nmouth. * * * I stepped very near the man and commenced a conversation\r\nwith him. He said he had been on board two years and a half, or eighteen\r\nmonths. He had completely lost count of time, was a skeleton and nearly\r\nnaked. This was only one case from perhaps a hundred similar. This man\r\nappeared in tolerable health as to body, his emaciation excepted. * * *\r\nThe discipline of the prisoners by the British was in many respects of\r\nthe most shocking and appalling character. The roll of the prisoners, as\r\nI was informed, was called every three months, unless a large acquisiton\r\nof prisoners should render it necessary more often. The next day\r\nafter our crew were put on board the roll was called, and the police\r\nregulations of the ship were read. I heard this. One of the new\r\nregulations was to the effect that every captive trying to get away\r\nshould suffer instant death, and should not even be taken on board\r\nalive.”\r\n\r\nIt appears that David Laird commanded the Old Jersey from 1778 until\r\nearly in the year 1781. He was then relieved of the command, and this\r\noffice was given to a man named John Sporne, or Spohn, until the 9th of\r\nApril, 1783, when all the prisoners remaining in her were released, and\r\nshe was abandoned. The dread of contagion kept visitors aloof. She was\r\nstill moored in the mud of the Wallabout by chain cables, and gradually\r\nsank lower and lower. There is a beam of her preserved as a curiosity at\r\nthe Naval Museum at Brooklyn.\r\n\r\nDavid Laird, the Scotchman who commanded her until the early part of\r\n1781, returned to New York after the peace of 1783 as captain of a\r\nmerchant ship, and moored his vessel at or near Peck’s Slip. A number of\r\npersons who had been prisoners on board the Jersey, and had suffered\r\nby his cruelty, assembled on the wharf to receive him, but he deemed\r\nit prudent to remain on ship-board during the short time his vessel was\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nIt is in the recollections of Ebenezer Fox that we have the only mention\r\never made of a woman on board that dreadful place, the Old Jersey, and\r\nalthough she may have been and probably was an abandoned character, yet\r\nshe seems to have been merciful, and unwilling to see the prisoners who\r\nwere attempting to escape, butchered before her eyes. It is indeed to be\r\nhoped that no other woman ever set foot in that terrible place to suffer\r\nwith the prisoners, and yet there are a few women’s names in the list of\r\nthese wretched creatures given in the appendix to this book. It is\r\nmost likely, however, that these were men, and that their feminine\r\nappellations were nicknames. [Footnote: One is named Nancy and one\r\nBella, etc.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nTESTIMONY OF PRISONERS ON BOARD THE JERSEY\r\n\r\n\r\nWe must again quote from Ebenezer Fox, whose description of the\r\nprovisions dealt out to the prisoners on board the prison ships shall\r\nnow be given.\r\n\r\n“The prisoners received their mess rations at nine in the morning. * *\r\n* All our food appeared to be damaged. The bread was mostly mouldy,\r\nand filled with worms. It required considerable rapping upon the deck,\r\nbefore these worms could be dislodged from their lurking places in a\r\nbiscuit. As for the pork, we were cheated out of it more than half the\r\ntime, and when it was obtained one would have judged from its motley\r\nhues, exhibiting the consistence and appearance of variegated soap, that\r\nit was the flesh of the porpoise or sea hog, and had been an inhabitant\r\nof the ocean, rather than a sty. * * * The flavor was so unsavory that\r\nit would have been rejected as unfit for the stuffing of even Bologna\r\nsausages. The provisions were generally damaged, and from the imperfect\r\nmanner in which they were cooked were about as indigestible as grape\r\nshot. The flour and oatmeal was often sour, and when the suet was mixed\r\nwith the flour it might be nosed half the length of the ship. The first\r\nview of the beef would excite an idea of veneration for its antiquity,\r\n* * * its color was a dark mahagony, and its solidity would have set the\r\nkeenest edge of a broad axe at defiance to cut across the grain, though\r\nlike oakum it could be pulled to pieces, one way, in strings, like rope\r\nyarn. * * * It was so completely saturated with salt that after having\r\nbeen boiled in water taken from the sea, it was found to be considerably\r\nfreshened by the process. * * * Such was our food, but the quality was\r\nnot all of which we had to complain. * * * The cooking was done in a\r\ngreat copper vessel. * * * The Jersey, from her size, and lying near the\r\nshore, was embedded in the mud, and I don’t recollect seeing her afloat\r\nthe whole time I was a prisoner. All the filth that accumulated among\r\nupwards of a thousand men was daily thrown overboard, and would remain\r\nthere until carried away by the tide. The impurity of the water may\r\nbe easily conceived, and in that water our meat was boiled. It will be\r\nrecollected, too, that the water was salt, which caused the inside of\r\nthe copper to be corroded to such a degree that it was lined with a coat\r\nof verdigris. Meat thus cooked must, in some degree, be poisoned, and\r\nthe effects of it were manifest in the cadaverous countenances of the\r\nemaciated beings who had remained on board for any length of time.\r\n\r\n“* * * We passed the night amid the accumulated horrors of sighs and\r\ngroans; of foul vapor; a nauseous and putrid atmosphere, in a stifling\r\nand almost suffocating heat. * * * Little sleep could be enjoyed, for\r\nthe vermin were so horribly abundant that all the personal cleanliness\r\nwe could practice would not protect us from their attacks.”\r\n\r\nThe public papers of the day often contained accounts of the cruelties\r\npracticed upon the prisoners on the ships. In the _Pennsylvania Packet_\r\nof Sept. 4th, 1781, there is an extract from a letter written by a\r\nprisoner whose name is not given.\r\n\r\n\r\n“EXTRACT FROM A LETTER DATED ON BOARD THE JERSEY (VULGARLY CALLED HELL)\r\nPRISON SHIP\r\n\r\n“New York August 10th 1781\r\n\r\n“There is nothing but death or entering into the British service before\r\nme. Our ship’s company is reduced by death and entering into the British\r\nservice to the small number of 19. * * * I am not able to give you even\r\nthe outlines of my exile; but this much I will inform you, that we bury\r\n6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 in a day. We have 200 more sick and falling sick\r\nevery day; the sickness is the yellow fever, small pox, and in short\r\neverything else that can be mentioned.”\r\n\r\n“New London. Conn. March 3rd. 1782. Sunday last a flag ship returned\r\nfrom New York which brought twenty Americans who had been a long time on\r\nboard a prison ship. About 1,000 of our countrymen remain in the prison\r\nships at New York, great part of whom have been in close confinement for\r\nmore than six months, and in the most deplorable condition: many of them\r\nseeing no prospect of release are entering into the British service to\r\nelude the contagion with which the ships are fraught.”\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER WRITTEN ON BOARD THE PRISON SHIP JERSEY, APRIL 26TH,\r\n1782.\r\n\r\n“I am sorry to write you from this miserable place. I can assure you\r\nthat since I have been here we have had only twenty men exchanged,\r\nalthough we are in number upwards of 700, exclusive of the sick in\r\nthe Hospital ships, who died like sheep; therefore my intention is, if\r\npossible, to enter on board some merchant or transport vessel, as it is\r\nimpossible for so many men to keep alive in one vessel.”\r\n\r\n“Providence. May 25th 1782. Sunday last a flag of truce returned here\r\nfrom New York and brought a few prisoners. We learn that 1100 Americans\r\nwere on board the prison and hospital ships at New York, when the flag\r\nsailed from thence, and that from six to seven were generally buried\r\nevery day.”\r\n\r\n“Salem. Mass. Extract from a letter of an officer on board the\r\nJersey.--‘The deplorable situation I am in cannot be expressed. The\r\ncaptains, lieutenants, and sailing masters have gone to the Provost,\r\nbut they have only gotten out of the frying pan into the fire. I am\r\nleft here with about 700 miserable objects, eaten up by lice, and daily\r\ntaking fevers, which carry them off fast. Nov 9th 1782.”\r\n\r\nBy repeated acts of cruelty on the part of the British the Americans\r\nwere, at last, stung to attempt something like retaliation. In 1782 a\r\nprison ship, given that name, was fitted up and stationed in the Thames\r\nnear New London, as we learn from the following extract:\r\n\r\n“New London, Conn. May 24th 1782. Last Saturday the Retaliation prison\r\nship was safely moored in the river Thames, about a mile from the ferry,\r\nfor the receipt of such British prisoners as may fall into our hands,\r\nsince which about 100 prisoners have been put on board.”\r\n\r\nIt is said that this ship was in use but a short time, and we have been\r\nunable to learn anything further of her history.\r\n\r\nThomas Philbrook, who was a prisoner on board the Jersey for several\r\nmonths was one of the “working-party,” whose duty it was to scrub the\r\ndecks, attend to the sick, and bring up the dead. He says: “As the\r\nmorning dawned there would be heard the loud, unfeeling, and horrid cry,\r\n‘Rebels! Bring up your dead!’\r\n\r\n“Staggering under the weight of some stark, still form, I would at\r\nlength gain the upper deck, when I would be met with the salutation:\r\n‘What! _you alive yet?_ Well, you are a tough one!’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nRECOLLECTIONS OF ANDREW SHERBURNE\r\n\r\n\r\nAndrew Sherburne, a lad of seventeen, shipped on the Scorpion, Captain\r\nR. Salter, a small vessel, with a crew of eighteen men. This vessel was\r\ncaptured by the Amphion, about the middle of November, 1782. Sherburne\r\nsays that the sailors plundered them of everything they possessed, and\r\nthat thirteen of them were put on board the Amphion, and sent down to\r\nthe cable tiers between the two decks, where they found nearly a hundred\r\nof their countrymen, who were prisoners of war.\r\n\r\n“We were very much crowded, and having nothing but the cables to lay on,\r\nour beds were as hard and unpleasant as though they were made of cord\r\nwood, and indeed we had not sufficient room for each to stretch himself\r\nat the same time.\r\n\r\n“After about two weeks we arrived at New York, and were put on board\r\nthat wretched ship the Jersey. The New York prison ships had been the\r\nterror of American tars for years. The Old Jersey had become notorious\r\nin consequence of the unparallelled mortality on board her. * * *\r\n\r\n“I entered the Jersey towards the last of November, I had just entered\r\nthe eighteenth year of my age, and had now to commence a scene of\r\nsuffering almost without a parallel. * * * A large proportion of the\r\nprisoners had been robbed of their clothing. * * * Early in the winter\r\nthe British took the Chesapeake frigate of about thirty guns, and 300\r\nhands. All were sent on board the Jersey, which so overcrowded her,\r\nthat she was very sickly. This crew died exceedingly fast, for a large\r\nproportion were fresh hands, unused to the sea.”\r\n\r\nSherburne says that boats from the city brought provisions to sell to\r\nsuch of the prisoners as were so fortunate as to be possessed of money,\r\nand that most of them were able to make purchases from them. A piece of\r\nsausage from seven to nine inches long sold for sixpence.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1783, Sherburne became ill and was sent to the Frederick,\r\na hospital ship. In this two men shared every bunk, and the conditions\r\nwere wretchedly unsanitary. He was placed in a bunk with a man named\r\nWills from Massachusetts, a very gentle and patient sufferer, who soon\r\ndied.\r\n\r\n“I have seen seven men drawn out and piled together on the lower\r\nhatchway, who had died in one night on board the Frederick.\r\n\r\n“There were ten or twelve nurses, and about a hundred sick. Some, if not\r\nall of the nurses, were prisoners. * * * They would indulge in playing\r\ncards and drinking, while their fellows were thirsting for water and\r\nsome dying. At night the hatches were shut down and locked, and the\r\nnurses lived in the steerage, and there was not the least attention paid\r\nto the sick except by the convalescent, who were so frequently called\r\nupon that, in many cases, they overdid themselves, relapsed, and died.”\r\n\r\nSherburne suffered extremely from the cold. “I have often,” he says\r\n“toiled the greatest part of the night, in rubbing my feet and legs to\r\nkeep them from freezing. * * * In consequence of these chills I have\r\nbeen obliged to wear a laced stocking upon my left leg for nearly thirty\r\nyears past. My bunk was directly against the ballast-port; and the port\r\nnot being caulked, when there came a snow-storm the snow would blow\r\nthrough the seams in my bed, but in those cases there was one advantage\r\nto me, when I could not otherwise procure water to quench my thirst.\r\nThe provision allowed the sick was a gill of wine, and twelve ounces of\r\nbread per day. The wine was of an ordinary quality, and the bread made\r\nof sour or musty flour, and sometimes poorly baked. There was a small\r\nsheet iron stove between decks, but the fuel was green, and not plenty,\r\nand there were some peevish and surly fellows generally about it. I\r\nnever got an opportunity to sit by it, but I could generally get the\r\nfavor of some one near it to lay a slice of bread upon it, to warm or\r\ntoast it a little, to put into my wine and water. We sometimes failed\r\nin getting our wine for several days together; we had the promise of its\r\nbeing made up to us, but this promise was seldom performed. * * * Water\r\nwas brought on board in casks by the working party, and when it was very\r\ncold it would freeze in the casks, and it would be difficult to get it\r\nout. * * * I was frequently under the necessity of pleading hard to\r\nget my cup filled. I could not eat my bread, but gave it to those who\r\nbrought me water. I have given three days allowance to have a tin cup\r\nof water brought me. * * * A company of the good citizens of New York\r\nsupplied all the sick with a pint of good Bohea tea, well sweetened with\r\nmolasses a day; and this was constant. I believe this tea saved my life,\r\nand the lives of hundreds of others. * * * The physicians used to\r\nvisit the sick once in several days: their stay was short, nor did they\r\nadminister much medicine. Were I able to give a full description of our\r\nwretched and filthy condition I should almost question whether it would\r\nbe credited. * * * It was God’s good pleasure to raise me up once more\r\nso that I could just make out to walk, and I was again returned to the\r\nJersey prison ship.”\r\n\r\nHere he received sad news. One of his uncles was a prisoner on board the\r\nJersey, and had been very kind to him, giving him a share of his money\r\nwith which to purchase necessaries. Now he found his uncle about to\r\ntake his place in the hospital ship. A boy named Stephen Nichols also\r\ninformed him of the death in his absence of the gunner of their ship,\r\nwhose name was Daniel Davis. This poor man had his feet and legs frozen,\r\nfrom which he died.\r\n\r\n“Nichols and myself were quite attached to each other. * * * We stalked\r\nabout the decks together, lamenting our forlorn condition. In a few days\r\nthere came orders to remove all the prisoners from the Jersey in\r\norder to cleanse the ship. We were removed on board of transports,\r\nand directly there came on a heavy storm. The ship on which I was was\r\nexceedingly crowded, so that there was not room enough for each man to\r\nlay down under deck, and the passing and repassing by day had made the\r\nlower deck entirely wet. Our condition was distressing. After a few\r\ndays we were all put on board the Jersey again. A large number had\r\ntaken violent colds, myself among the rest. The hospital ships were soon\r\ncrowded, and even the Jersey herself shortly became about as much of a\r\nhospital ship as the others.”\r\n\r\nSherburne was again sent to a hospital ship, where he was rejoiced to\r\nfind his uncle convalescing. A man who lay next him had been a nurse,\r\nbut had had his feet and legs frozen, the toes and bottom of his feet\r\nfell off.\r\n\r\nTwo brothers shared a bunk near him. Their names were John and Abraham\r\nFalls. John was twenty-three, and Abraham only sixteen. Both were very\r\nsick. One night Abraham was heard imploring John not to lie on him, and\r\nthe other invalids reproached him for his cruelty in thus treating his\r\nyoung brother. But John was deaf to their reproaches, for he was dead.\r\nAbraham was too ill to move from under him. Next day the dead brother\r\nwas removed from the living one, but it was too late to save him, and\r\nthe poor boy died that morning.\r\n\r\nSherburne says that only five of his crew of thirteen survived, and that\r\nin many instances a much larger proportion died.\r\n\r\n“At length came news of peace. It was exceedingly trying to our feelings\r\nto see our ship mates daily leaving us, until our ship was almost\r\ndeserted. We were, however, convalescent, but we gained exceedingly\r\nslowly. * * * I think there were but seven or eight left on board the\r\nhospital ship when we left it, in a small schooner sent from R. I.,\r\nfor the purpose of taking home some who belonged to that place, and the\r\ncommander of the hospital ship had the humanity to use his influence\r\nwith the master of the cartel to take us on board, and to our\r\nunspeakable joy he consented.”\r\n\r\nWhen at last he reached home he says: “My brother Sam took me into\r\nanother room to divest me of my filthy garments and to wash and dress\r\nme. He having taken off my clothes and seen my bones projecting here and\r\nthere, was so astonished that his strength left him. He sat down on the\r\npoint of fainting, and could render me no further service. I was able to\r\nwash myself and put on my clothes.”\r\n\r\nAfter this he was obliged to spend twenty days in bed. Poor Mrs. Falls,\r\nthe mother of the two young men who had died on the hospital ship,\r\ncalled on him and heard the fate of her sons. She was in an agony, and\r\nalmost fainted, and kept asking if it was not a mistake that _both_ were\r\ndead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN ROSWELL PALMER\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year 1865 a son of Captain Roswell Palmer, of Connecticut, wrote\r\na letter to Mr. Henry Drowne, in which he narrates the story of his\r\nfather’s captivity, which we will condense in these pages. He says that\r\nhis father was born in Stonington, Conn., in August, 1764, and was about\r\nseventeen at the time of his capture by the British, which must have\r\nbeen in 1781.\r\n\r\nPalmer had several relations in the army, and was anxious to enlist,\r\nbut was rejected as too young. His uncle, however, received him as an\r\nassistant in the Commissary Department, and when the brig Pilgrim,\r\nof Stonington, was commissioned to make war on the public enemy, the\r\nrejected volunteer was warmly welcomed on board by his kinsman, Captain\r\nHumphrey Crary.\r\n\r\nThe first night after putting to sea, the Pilgrim encountered a British\r\nfleet just entering the Vineyard Sound. A chase and running fight\r\nof several hours ensued, but at length the vessel was crippled and\r\ncompelled to surrender. The prize was taken into Holmes’ Hole, and the\r\ncrew subsequently brought to New York. Mr. Henry Palmer thus describes\r\nthe Jersey, which was his father’s destination.\r\n\r\n“The Jersey never left her anchorage at the Wallabout, whether from\r\ndecrepitude, or the intolerable burden of woes and wrongs accumulated\r\nin her wretched hulk,--but sank slowly down at last into the subjacent\r\nooze, as if to hide her shame from human sight, and more than forty\r\nyears after my father pointed out to me at low tide huge remnants of her\r\nunburied skeleton.\r\n\r\n“On board of this dread Bastile were crowded year after year, some 1,400\r\nprisoners, mostly Americans. The discipline was very strict, while the\r\nsmallest possible attention was paid by their warders to the sufferings\r\nof the captives. Cleanliness was simply an impossibility, where\r\nthe quarters were so narrow, the occupants so numerous, and little\r\nopportunity afforded for washing the person or the tatters that sought\r\nto hide its nakedness. Fortunate was the wretch who possessed a clean\r\nlinen rag, for this, placed in his bosom, seemed to attract to it crowds\r\nof his crawling tormentors, whose squatter sovereignty could be disposed\r\nof by the wholesale at his pleasure.\r\n\r\n“The food of the prisoners consisted mainly of spoiled sea biscuit,\r\nand of navy beef, which had become worthless from long voyaging in many\r\nclimes years before. These biscuits were so worm-eaten that a slight\r\npressure of the hand reduced them to dust, which rose up in little\r\nclouds of insubstantial aliment, as if in mockery of the half famished\r\nexpectants. For variety a ration called ‘Burgoo,’ was prepared several\r\ntimes a week, consisting of mouldy oatmeal and water, boiled in two\r\ngreat Coppers, and served out in tubs, like swill to swine.\r\n\r\n“By degrees they grew callous to each other’s miseries, and alert to\r\nseize any advantage over their fellow sufferers. Many played cards day\r\nand night, regardless of the scenes of woe and despair around them. *\r\n* * The remains (of those who died) were huddled into blankets, and so\r\nslightly interred on the neighboring slope that scores of them, bared by\r\nthe rains, were always visible to their less fortunate comrades left to\r\npine in hopeless captivity. * * * After having been imprisoned about a\r\nyear and a half my father, one night, during a paroxysm of fever, rushed\r\non board, and jumped overboard.\r\n\r\n“The shock restored him to consciousness, he was soon rescued, and the\r\nnext morning was taken by the Surgeon-General’s orders to his quarters\r\nin Cherry St., near Pearl, where he remained until the close of the war.\r\nThe kind doctor had taken a fancy to the handsome Yankee patient, whom\r\nhe treated with fatherly kindness; giving him books to read; and having\r\nhim present at his operations and dissections; and finally urged him\r\nto seek his fortune in Europe, where he should receive a good surgical\r\neducation free of charge.\r\n\r\n“The temptation was very great, but the rememberance of a nearer home\r\nand dearer friends, unseen for years, was greater, and to them the long\r\nlost returned at last, as one from the dead.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Palmer commanded a merchant ship after the war, retired and\r\nbought a farm near Stockbridge, Mass. He followed the sea over forty\r\nyears. In appearance he was very tall, erect, robust, and of rare\r\nphysical power and endurance. He had remarkably small hands and feet, a\r\nhigh and fair forehead, his hair was very black, a tangle of luxuriant\r\ncurls, and his eyes were clear hazel. He died in his 79th year, in 1844,\r\nleaving a large family of children. In his own memoranda he writes:\r\n“Four or five hundred Frenchmen were transferred as prisoners to\r\nthe orlop deck of the Jersey. They were much better treated than we\r\nAmericans on the deck above them. All, however, suffered very much for\r\nthe want of water, crowding around two half hogsheads when they were\r\nbrought on board, and often fighting for the first drink. On one of\r\nthese occasions a Virginian near me was elbowed by a Spaniard and thrust\r\nhim back. The Spaniard drew a sheath knife, when the Virginian knocked\r\nhim headlong backwards, down two hatches, which had just been opened for\r\nheaving up a hogshead of stale water from the hold, for the prisoners’\r\ndrink. This water had probably been there for years, and was as ropy as\r\nmolasses.\r\n\r\n“There was a deal of trouble between the American and the French and\r\nSpanish prisoners. The latter slept in hammocks, we, on the _floor_ of\r\nthe deck next above them. One night our boys went down * * * and, at\r\na given signal, cut the hammock lashings of the French and Spanish\r\nprisoners at the head, and let them all down by the run on the dirty\r\nfloor. In the midst of the row that followed this deed of darkness, the\r\nAmericans stole back to their quarters, and were all fast asleep when\r\nthe English guard came down.\r\n\r\n“No lights were permitted after ten o’clock. We used, however, to hide\r\nour candles occasionally under our hats, when the order came to\r\n‘Douse the glim!’ One night the officer of the guard discovered our\r\ndisobedience, and came storming down the hatchway with a file of\r\nsoldiers. Our lights were all extinguished in a moment, and we on the\r\nalert for our tyrants, whom we seized with a will, and hustled to and\r\nfro in the darkness, till their cries aroused the whole ship.”\r\n\r\nAn uncle of Roswell Palmer’s named Eliakim Palmer, a man named Thomas\r\nHitchcock, and John Searles were prisoners on board the Scorpion, a\r\nBritish 74, anchored off the Battery, New York. They were about to be\r\ntransferred to the Old Jersey, when Hitchcock went into the chains and\r\ndropped his hat into the water. On his return he begged for a boat\r\nto recover it, and being earnestly seconded by Lieutenant Palmer, the\r\nofficer of the deck finally consented, ordering a guard to accompany the\r\n“damned rebels.” They were a long time in getting the boat off. The hat,\r\nin the mean time, floated away from the ship. They rowed very awkardly,\r\nof course got jeered at uproariously for “Yankee land lubbers,” and\r\nwere presently ordered to return. Being then nearly out of musket range,\r\nLieutenant Palmer suddenly seized and disarmed the astonished guard,\r\nwhile his comrades were not slow in manifesting their latent adroitness\r\nin the use of the oar, to the no less astonishment of their deriders. In\r\na moment the Bay was alive with excitement; many shots, big and little,\r\nwere fired at the audacious fugitives from all the fleet; boats put\r\noff in hot pursuit; but the Stonington boys reached the Jersey shore in\r\nsafety, and escaped with their prisoner to Washington’s headquarters,\r\nwhere the tact and bravery they had displayed received the approval of\r\nthe great commander.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Eliakim Palmer was again taken prisoner later in the war and\r\nagain escaped. This time he was on board the Jersey. He cut away three\r\niron bars let into an aperture on the side of the ship on the orlop\r\ndeck, formerly a part of her hold. He swam ashore with his shirt and\r\ntrousers tied to his head. Having lost his trousers he was obliged to\r\nmake his way down Long Island for nearly its whole length, in his shirt\r\nonly. He hid in ditches during the day, subsisting on berries, and\r\nthe bounty of cows, milked directly into his mouth. He crawled by the\r\nsentries stationed at different parts of the island, and at length,\r\nafter many days, reached Oyster Pond Point, whence he was smuggled by\r\nfriends to his home in Stonington, Conn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\nTHE NARRATIVE OF CAPTAIN ALEXANDER COFFIN\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1807 Dr. Mitchell, of New York published a small volume entitled:\r\n“The Destructive Operation of Foul Air, Tainted Provisions, Bad Water,\r\nand Personal Filthiness, Upon Human Constitutions, Exemplified in the\r\nUnparallelled Cruelty of the British to the American Captives at New\r\nYork During the Revolutionary War, on Board their Prison and Hospital\r\nships. By Captain Alexander Coffin, Junior, One of the Surviving\r\nSufferers. In a Communication to Dr. Mitchell, dated September 4th,\r\n1807.”\r\n\r\nTruly our ancestors were long-winded! A part of this narrative is as\r\nfollows: “I shall furnish you with an account of the treatment that I,\r\nwith other of my fellow citizens, received on board the Jersey and John\r\nprison ships, those monuments of British barbarity and infamy. I shall\r\ngive you nothing but a plain simple statement of facts that cannot be\r\ncontroverted. And I begin my narrative from the time of my leaving the\r\nSouth Carolina frigate.\r\n\r\n“In June, 1782, I left the above-mentioned frigate in the Havana, on\r\nboard of which I had long served as a mid-ship-man, and made several\r\ntrading voyages. I sailed early in September, from Baltimore, for the\r\nHavana, in a fleet of about forty sail, most of which were captured, and\r\nwe among the rest, by the British frigate, Ceres, Captain Hawkins, a man\r\nin every sense of the word a perfect brute.\r\n\r\n“Though our commander, Captain Hughes, was a very gentlemanly man, he\r\nwas treated in the most shameful and abusive manner by said Hawkins,\r\nand ordered below to mess with the petty officers. Our officers were put\r\ninto the cable tier, with the crew, and a guard placed at the hatchway\r\nto prevent more than two going on deck at a time. The provisions were\r\nof the very worst kind, and very short allowance even of them. They\r\nfrequently gave us pea-soup, that is pea-water, for the pease and the\r\nsoup, all but about a gallon or two, were taken for the ship’s company,\r\nand the coppers filled up with water, and brought down to us in a\r\nstrap-tub. And Sir, I might have defied any person on earth, possessing\r\nthe most acute olfactory powers and the most refined taste to decide,\r\neither by one or the other or both of these senses, whether it was pease\r\nand water, slush and water, or swill.\r\n\r\n“After living and being treated in this way, subject to every insult and\r\nabuse for ten or twelve days, we fell in with the Champion, a British\r\ntwenty gun ship, which was bound to New York to refit, and were all sent\r\non board of her The Captain was a true seaman and a gentleman, and our\r\ntreatment was so different from what we had experienced on board the\r\nCeres, that it was like being removed from Purgatory to Paradise. His\r\nname, I think, was Edwards.\r\n\r\n“We arrived about the beginning of October in New York and were\r\nimmediately sent on board the prison-ship in a small schooner, called,\r\nironically enough, the Relief, commanded by one Gardner, an Irishman.\r\n\r\n“This schooner Relief plied between the prison ship and New York, and\r\ncarried the water and provisions from that city to the ship. In fact the\r\nsaid schooner might emphatically be called the Relief, for the\r\nexecrable water and provisions she carried relieved many of my brave but\r\nunfortunate countrymen by death, from the misery and savage treatment\r\nthey daily endured.\r\n\r\n“Before I go on to relate the treatment we experienced on board the\r\nJersey, I will make one remark, and that is if you were to rake the\r\ninfernal regions, I doubt whether you could find such another set\r\nof demons as the officers and men who had charge of the Old Jersey\r\nPrison-ship, and, Sir, I shall not be surprised if you, possessing the\r\nfiner feelings which I believe to be interwoven in the composition of\r\nmen, and which are not totally torn from the _piece_, till by a long and\r\nobstinate perseverance in the meanest, the basest, and cruellest of all\r\nhuman acts, a man becomes lost to every sense of honor, of justice, of\r\nhumanity, and common honesty; I shall not be surprised, I say, if you,\r\npossessing these finer feelings, should doubt whether men could be so\r\nlost to their sacred obligations to their God; and the moral ties which\r\nought to bind them to their duty toward their fellow men, as those men\r\nwere, who had the charge, and also who had any agency in the affairs of\r\nthe Jersey prison-ship.\r\n\r\n“On my arrival on board the Old Jersey, I found there about 1,100\r\nprisoners; many of them had been there from three to six months, but few\r\nlived over that time if they did not get away by some means or other.\r\nThey were generally in the most deplorable situation, mere walking\r\nskeletons, without money, and scarcely clothes to cover their nakedness,\r\nand overrun with lice from head to feet.\r\n\r\n“The provisions, Sir, that were served out to us, was not more than\r\nfour or five ounces of meat, and about as much bread, all condemned\r\nprovisions from the ships of war, which, no doubt, were supplied with\r\nnew in their stead, and the new, in all probability, charged by the\r\ncommissaries to the Jersey. They, however, know best about that; and\r\nhowever secure they may now feel, they will have to render an account of\r\nthat business to a Judge who cannot be deceived. This fact, however, I\r\ncan safely aver, that both the times I was confined on board the prison\r\nships, there never were provisions served out to the prisoners that\r\nwould have been eatable by men that were not literally in a starving\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n“The water that we were forced to use was carried from the city, and\r\nI postively assert that I never after having followed the sea thirty\r\nyears, had on board of any ship, (and I have been three years on some\r\nof my voyages,) water so bad as that we were obliged to use on board the\r\nOld Jersey; when there was, as it were to tantalize us, as pure water,\r\nnot more than three cables length from us, at the Mill in the Wallabout,\r\nas was perhaps ever drank.\r\n\r\n“There were hogs kept in pens on the Gun-deck for their own use; and I\r\nhave seen the prisoners watch an opportunity, and with a tin pot steal\r\nthe bran from the hogs’ trough, and go into the Galley and when they\r\ncould get an opportunity, boil it over the fire, and eat it, as you,\r\nSir, would eat of good soup when hungry. This I have seen more than\r\nonce, and there are now living besides me, who can bear testimony to the\r\nsame fact. There are many other facts equally abominable that I could\r\nmention, but the very thought of those things brings to my recollection\r\nscenes the most distressing.\r\n\r\n“When I reflect how many hundreds of my brave and intrepid countrymen\r\nI have seen, in all the bloom of health, brought on board of that ship,\r\nand in a few days numbered with the dead, in consequence of the savage\r\ntreatment they there received, I can but adore my Creator that He\r\nsuffered me to escape; but I did not escape, Sir, without being brought\r\nto the very verge of the grave.\r\n\r\n“This was the second time I was on board, which I shall mention more\r\nparticularly hereafter. Those of us who had money fared much better than\r\nthose who had none. I had made out to save, when taken, about twenty\r\ndollars, and with that I could buy from the bumboats, that were\r\npermitted to come alongside, bread, fruit, etc.; but, Sir, the\r\nbumboatmen were of the same kidney as the officers of the Jersey and we\r\ngot nothing from them without paying through the nose for it, and I soon\r\nfound the bottom of my purse; after which I fared no better than the\r\nrest. I was, however, fortunate in one respect; for after having been\r\nthere about six weeks, two of my countrymen, (I am a Nantucket man)\r\nhappened to come to New York to endeavor to recover a whaling sloop that\r\nhad been captured, with a whaling license from Admiral Digby; and they\r\nfound means to procure my release, passing me for a Quaker, to which I\r\nconfess I had no pretensions further than my mother being a member of\r\nthat respectable society. Thus, Sir, I returned to my friends, fit for\r\nthe newest fashion, after an absence of three years.\r\n\r\n“For my whole wardrobe I carried on my back, which consisted of a\r\njacket, shirt, and trousers, a pair of old shoes and a handkerchief,\r\nwhich served me for a hat, and had more than two months, for I lost my\r\nhat the day we were taken, from the maintop-gallant yard, furling the\r\ntop-gallant sail.\r\n\r\n“My clothing, I forgot to mention, was completed laced with locomotive\r\ntinsel, and moved as by instinct, in all directions; but as my mother\r\nwas not fond of such company, she furnished me with a suit of my\r\nfather’s, who was absent at sea, and condemned my laced suit for the\r\nbenefit of all concerned.\r\n\r\n“Being then in the prime of youth, about eighteen years of age, and\r\nnaturally of a roving disposition; I could not bear the idea of being\r\nidle at home. I therefore proceeded to Providence, R. I., and shipped\r\non board the brig Betsy and Polly, Captain Robert Folger, bound for\r\nVirginia and Amsterdam. We sailed from Newport early in February, 1783;\r\nand were taken five days after, off the capes of Virginia, by the Fair\r\nAmerican privateer, of those parts, mounting sixteen six-pounders,\r\nand having 85 men, commanded by one Burton, a refugee, most of whose\r\nofficers were of the same stamp. We were immediately handcuffed two and\r\ntwo, and ordered into the hold in the cable-tier. Having been plundered\r\nof our beds and bedding, the softest bed we had was the soft side of a\r\nwater cask, and the coils of a cable.\r\n\r\n“The Fair American, after having been handsomely dressed by an United\r\nStates vessel of half of her force, was obliged to put into New York,\r\nthen in possession of the British army, to refit, and we arrived within\r\nthe Hook about the beginning of March, and were put on board a pilot\r\nboat, and brought up to this city. The boat hauled up alongside the\r\nCrane-wharf, where we had our irons knocked off, the mark of which I\r\ncarry to this day; and were put on board the same schooner, Relief,\r\nmentioned in a former part of this narrative, and sent up once more to\r\nthe prison-ship.\r\n\r\n“It was just three months from my leaving the Old Jersey to my being\r\nagain a prisoner on board of her, and on my return I found but very few\r\nof the men I had left three months before. Some had made their escape;\r\nsome had been exchanged; but the greater part had taken up their abode\r\nunder the surface of the hill, which you can see from your windows,\r\nwhere their bones are mouldering to dust, mingled with mother earth;\r\na lesson to Americans, written _in capitals, on British cruelty and\r\ninjustice_.\r\n\r\n“I found, on my return on board the Jersey, more prisoners than when I\r\nleft her; and she being so crowded, they were obliged to send about 200\r\nof us on board the John, a transport-ship of about 300 tons.\r\n\r\n“There we were treated worse, if possible, than on board the Jersey, and\r\nour accommodations were infinitely worse, for the Jersey, being an old,\r\ncondemned 64 gun ship had two tiers of ports fore and aft, air-ports,\r\nand large hatchways, which gave a pretty free circulation of air through\r\nthe ship; whereas the John, being a merchant-ship, and with small\r\nhatchways, and the hatchways being laid down every night, and no man\r\nbeing allowed to go on deck * * * the effluvia arising from these,\r\ntogether with the already contaminated air, occasioned by the breath\r\nof so many people so pent up together, was enough to destroy men of the\r\nmost healthy and robust constitutions. All the time I was on board this\r\nship, not a prisoner eat his allowance, bad as it was, cooked, more than\r\nthree or four times; but eat it raw as it came out of the barrel. * *\r\n* In the middle of the ship, between decks, was raised a platform of\r\nboards about two and a half feet high, for those prisoners to sleep on\r\nwho had no hammocks. On this they used frequently to sit and play at\r\ncards to pass the time. One night in particular, several of us sat to\r\nsee them play until about ten o’clock, and then retired to our hammocks.\r\nAbout one A. M, we were called and told that one Bird was dying; we\r\nturned out and went to where he lay, and found him just expiring. Thus,\r\nat 10 P. M, the young man was apparently as well as any of us, and at\r\none A. M. had paid the debt to nature. Many others went off in the same\r\nway. It will perhaps be said that men die suddenly anywhere. True,\r\nbut do they die suddenly anywhere from the same cause? After all\r\nthese things it is, I think, impossible for the mind to form any other\r\nconclusion than that there was a premeditated design to destroy as many\r\nAmericans as they could on board the prison-ships; the treatment of the\r\nprisoners warrants the conclusion; but it is mean, base, and cowardly,\r\nto endeavor to conquer an enemy by such infamous means, and truly\r\ncharacteristic of base and cowardly wretches. The truly brave will\r\nalways treat their prisoners well.\r\n\r\n“There were two or three hospital-ships near the prison-ships; and so\r\nsoon as any of the prisoners complained of being sick, they were sent on\r\nboard of one of them; and I verily believe that not one out of a hundred\r\never returned or recovered. I am sure I never knew but one to recover.\r\nAlmost, and in fact I believe I may say every morning, a large boat from\r\neach of the hospital ships went loaded with dead bodies, which were all\r\ntumbled together into a hole dug for the purpose, on the hill where the\r\nnational navy-yard now is.\r\n\r\n“A singular affair happened on board of one of the hospital-ships, and\r\nno less true than singular. All the prisoners that died after the boat\r\nwith the load had gone ashore were sewed up in hammocks, and left on\r\ndeck till next morning. As usual, a great number had thus been disposed\r\nof. In the morning, while employed in loading the boat, one of the\r\nseamen perceived motion in one of the hammocks, just as they were about\r\nlaunching it down the board placel for that purpose from the gunwale of\r\nthe ship into the boat, and exclaimed, ‘Damn my eyes! That fellow isn’t\r\ndead!’ and if I have been rightly informed, and I believe I have, there\r\nwas quite a dispute between the man and the others about it. They swore\r\nhe was dead enough, and should go into the boat; he swore he should not\r\nbe launched, as they termed it, and took his knife and ripped open the\r\nhammock, and behold, the man was really alive. There had been a heavy\r\nrain during the night; and as the vital functions had not totally\r\nceased, but were merely suspended in consequence of the main-spring\r\nbeing out of order, this seasonable moistening must have given tone\r\nand elasticity to the great spring, which must have communicated to the\r\nlesser ones, and put the whole machinery again into motion. You know\r\nbetter about this than I do, and can better judge of the cause of the\r\nre-animation of the man. * * * He was a native of Rhode Island; his name\r\nwas Gavot. He went to Rhode Island in the same flag of truce as myself,\r\nabout a month afterwards. I felt extremely ill, but made out to\r\nkeep about until I got home. My parents then lived on the island of\r\nNantucket. I was then taken down, and lay in my bed six weeks in the\r\nmost deplorable situation; my body was swelled to a great degree, and\r\nmy legs were as big round as my body now is, and affected with the most\r\nexcruciating pains. What my disorder was I will not pretend to say; but\r\nDr. Tupper, quite an eminent physician, and a noted tory, who attended\r\nme, declared to my mother that he knew of nothing that would operate\r\nin the manner that my disorder did, but poison. For the truth of that\r\nI refer to my father and brothers, and to Mr. Henry Coffin, father to\r\nCaptain Peter Coffin, of the Manchester Packet of this point.\r\n\r\n“Thus, Sir, in some haste, without much attention to order or diction,\r\nI have given you part of the history of my life and sufferings, but I\r\nendeavored to bear them as became an American. And I must mention before\r\nI close, to the everlasting honor of those unfortunate Americans who\r\nwere on board the Jersey, that notwithstanding the savage treatment they\r\nreceived, and death staring them in the face, every attempt which was\r\nmade by the British to persuade them to enter their ships of war or in\r\ntheir army, was treated with the utmost contempt; and I saw only one\r\ninstance of defection while I was on board, and that person was hooted\r\nat and abused by the prisoners till the boat was out of hearing. Their\r\npatriotism in preferring such treatment, and even death in its most\r\nfrightful shapes, to the service of the British, and fighting against\r\ntheir own country has seldom been equalled, certainly never excelled,\r\nand if there be no monument raised with hands to commemorate the virtue\r\nof those men, it is stamped in capitals on the heart of every American\r\nacquainted with their merit and sufferings, and will there remain as\r\nlong as the blood flows from its fountains.”\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that many of the prisoners on board the Jersey\r\nwere impressed into the service of British men-of-war, and that others\r\nvoluntarily enlisted for garrison duty in the West Indies. It seems\r\nprobable, however, that, as Captain Coffin asserts, few enlisted in\r\nthe service to fight against their own countrymen, and those few were\r\nprobably actuated by the hope of deserting. It is certain that thousands\r\npreferred death to such a method of escaping from prison, as is proved\r\nby the multitudes of corpses interred in the sand of the Wallabout, all\r\nof whom could, in this way, have saved their lives. Conditions changed\r\non board the Jersey, from time to time. Thus, the water supply that was\r\nat one time brought by the schooner Relief from New York, was, at other\r\ntimes, procured from a beautiful spring on Long Island, as we will see\r\nin our next chapter.\r\n\r\nSome of the prisoners speak of the foul air on board the prison ship\r\ncaused by the fact that all her port holes were closed, and a few\r\nopenings cut in her sides, which were insufficient to ventilate her.\r\nCoffin says there was a good passage of air through the vessel from\r\nher port holes. It is probable that the Jersey became so notorious as a\r\ndeath trap that at last, for very shame, some attempt was made to secure\r\nmore sanitary conditions. Thus, just before peace was established, she\r\nwas, for the first time, overhauled and cleaned, the wretched occupants\r\nbeing sent away for the purpose. The port holes were very probably\r\nopened, and this is the more likely as we read of some of the prisoners\r\nfreezing to death during the last year of the war. From that calamity,\r\nat least, they were safe as long as they were deprived of outer air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\nA WONDERFUL DELIVERANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are few records of religious feeling on board the “Jersey,\r\nvulgarly called ‘Hell.’” No clergyman was ever known to set foot on\r\nboard of her, although a city of churches was so near. The fear of\r\ncontagion may have kept ministers of the gospel away. Visitors came, as\r\nwe have seen, but not to soothe the sufferings of the prisoners, or\r\nto comfort those who were dying. It is said that a young doctor, named\r\nGeorge Vandewater attended the sick, until he took a fatal disease and\r\ndied. He was a resident of Brooklyn, and seems to have been actuated\r\nby motives of humanity, and therefore his name deserves a place in this\r\nrecord.\r\n\r\nBut although the rough seamen who left narratives of their experiences\r\nin that fearful place have told us little or nothing about the inner\r\nfeelings of those poor sufferers, yet it must be presumed that many\r\na silent prayer went up to the Judge and Father of all men, from the\r\ndepths of that foul prison ship. There was one boy on board the Jersey,\r\none at least, and we hope that there were many more, who trusted in God\r\nthat He could deliver him, even “from the nethermost hell.”\r\n\r\nA large proportion of the prisoners were young men in their teens, who\r\nhad been attracted by the mysterious fascination of the sea; many of\r\nthem had run away from good homes, and had left sorrowing parents and\r\nfriends to mourn their loss. The feelings of these young men, full of\r\neager hopes, and as yet unsoured by too rough handling in their wrestle\r\nwith the world, suddenly transferred to the deck of the Jersey, has\r\nbeen well described by Fox and other captives, whose adventures we have\r\ntranscribed in these pages.\r\n\r\nWe have now to tell the experience of a youth on the Jersey who lived to\r\nbe a minister, and for many years was in charge of a church at Berkeley.\r\nThis youth was sensitive, delicate, and far from strong. His faith in\r\nhuman nature received a shock, and his disposition was warped at the\r\nmost receptive and formative period of his life, by the terrible scenes\r\nof suffering on the one hand, and relentless cruelty on the other, that\r\nhe witnessed in that fatal place. He wrote, in his memoir many years\r\nafter: _“I have since found that the whole world is but one great\r\nprison-house of guilty, sorrowful, and dying men, who live in pride,\r\nenvy, and malice, hateful, and hating one another.”_\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most terrible indictments of the human race that was\r\never written. Let us hope that it is not wholly true.\r\n\r\nIn 1833 the Rev. Thomas Andros published his recollections under the\r\ntitle, “The Old Jersey Captive.” We will give an abstract of them. He\r\nbegins by saying: “I was but in my seventeenth year when the struggle\r\ncommenced. In the summer of 1781 the ship Hannah, a very rich prize, was\r\ncaptured and brought into the port of New London. It infatuated great\r\nnumbers of our young men who flocked on board our private armed ships\r\nin hopes of as great a prize. * * * I entered on board a new Brig called\r\nthe ‘Fair American.’ She carried sixteen guns. * * * We were captured\r\non the 27th of August, by the Solebay frigate, and safely stowed away in\r\nthe Old Jersey prison ship at New York, an old, unsightly, rotten hulk.\r\n\r\n“Her dark and filthy appearance perfectly corresponded with the death\r\nand despair that reigned within. She was moored three quarters of a mile\r\nto the eastward of Brooklyn ferry, near a tide-mill on the Long Island\r\nshore. The nearest distance to land was about twenty rods. No other\r\nBritish ship ever proved the means of the destruction of so many human\r\nbeings.”\r\n\r\nAndros puts the number of men who perished on board the Jersey as\r\n11,000, and continues: “After it was known that it was next to certain\r\ndeath to confine a prisoner here, the inhumanity and wickedness of\r\ndoing it was about the same as if he had been taken into the city and\r\ndeliberately shot on some public square. * * * Never did any Howard\r\nor angel of pity appear to inquire into or alleviate our woes. Once\r\nor twice a bag of apples was hurled into the midst of hundreds of\r\nprisoners, crowded together as thick as they could stand, and life and\r\nlimbs were endangered by the scramble. This was a cruel sport. When I\r\nsaw it about to commence I fled to the most distant part of the ship.”\r\n\r\nAt night, he says, the prisoners were driven down to darkness between\r\ndecks, secured by iron gratings and an armed soldiery. He thus speaks\r\nof the tasks imposed upon the prisoners: “Around the well-room an armed\r\nguard were forcing up the prisoners to the winches to clear the ship of\r\nwater, and prevent her sinking; and little could be heard but a roar of\r\nmutual execrations, reproaches and insults.\r\n\r\n  “Sights of woe, regions of sorrow, doleful shades;\r\n  Where peace and rest can never dwell\r\n\r\n“When I became an inmate of this abode of suffering, despair, and death,\r\nthere were about 400 on board, but in a short time they were increased\r\nto 1,200.\r\n\r\n“All the most deadly diseases were pressed into the service of the\r\nking of terrors, but his prime ministers were dysentery, small pox, and\r\nyellow fever. The healthy and the diseased were mingled together in the\r\nmain ship.”\r\n\r\nHe says that the two hospital ships were soon overcrowded, and that two\r\nhundred or more of the prisoners, who soon became sick in consequence\r\nof the want of room, were lodged in the fore-part of the lower gun-deck,\r\nwhere all the prisoners were confined at night.\r\n\r\n“Utter derangement was a common sympton of yellow fever, and to increase\r\nthe horror of darkness which enshrouded us, for we were allowed no\r\nlight, the voice of warning would be heard, ‘Take care! There’s a madman\r\nstalking through the ship with a knife in his hand!’”\r\n\r\nAndros says that he sometimes found the man by whose side he had lain\r\nall night a corpse in the morning. There were many sick with raging\r\nfever, and their loud cries for water, which could only be obtained\r\non the upper deck, mingled with the groans of the dying, and the\r\nexecrations of the tormented sufferers. If they attempted to get water\r\nfrom the upper deck, the sentry would push them back with his bayonet.\r\nAndros, at one time, had a narrow escape with his life, from one of\r\nthese bayonet thrusts.\r\n\r\n“In the morning the hatches were thrown open and we were allowed to\r\nascend. The first object we saw was a boat loaded with dead bodies\r\nconveying them to the Long Island shore, where they were very slightly\r\ncovered with sand. * * * Let our disease be what it would we were\r\nabandoned to our fate. No English physician ever came near us.”\r\n\r\nThirteen of the crew to which Andros belonged were on the Jersey. In a\r\nshort time all but three or four were dead. The healthiest died first.\r\nThey were seized vith yellow fever, which was an epidemic on the ship,\r\nand died in a few hours. Andros escaped contagion longer than any of\r\nhis companions, with one exception. He says that the prisoners were\r\nfurnished with buckets and brushes to cleanse the ship, and vinegar to\r\nsprinkle the floors, but that most of them had fallen into a condition\r\nof apathy and despair, and that they seldom exerted themselves to\r\nimprove their condition.\r\n\r\n“The encouragement to do so was small. The whole ship was equally\r\naffected, and contained pestilence enough to desolate a world; disease\r\nand death were wrought into her very timbers. At the time I left it is\r\nto be supposed a more filthy, contagious, and deadly abode never existed\r\namong a Christianized people.\r\n\r\n“The lower hold and the orlop deck were such a terror that no man would\r\nventure down into them. * * * Our water was good could we have had\r\nenough of it: the bread was superlatively bad. I do not recollect seeing\r\nany which was not full of living vermin, but eat it, worms and all, we\r\nmust, or starve. * * * A secret, prejudicial to a prisoner, revealed\r\nto the guard, was death. Captain Young of Boston concealed himself in a\r\nlarge chest belonging to a sailor going to be exchanged, and was carried\r\non board the cartel, and we considered his escape as certain, but the\r\nsecret leaked out, and he was brought back and one Spicer of Providence\r\nbeing suspected as the traitor the enraged prisoners were about to cut\r\nhis throat. The guard rushed down and rescued him.\r\n\r\n“I knew no one to be seduced into the British service. They tried to\r\nforce one of our crew into the navy, but he chose rather to die than\r\nperform any duty, and he was again restored to the prison-ship.”\r\n\r\nAndros declares that there was no trace of religion exhibited on board\r\nthe Jersey. He also says that the prisoners made a set of rules for\r\nthemselves by which they regulated their conduct towards each other. No\r\none was allowed to tyrannize over the weak, and morality was enforced by\r\nrules, and any infraction of these regulations was severely punished.\r\n\r\nHe speaks of scenes of dreadful suffering which he witnessed:\r\n\r\n  “Which things, most worthy of pity, I myself saw,\r\n  And of them was a part.”\r\n\r\n“The prison ship is a blot which a thousand ages cannot eradicate from\r\nthe name of Britian. * * * While on board almost every thought was\r\noccupied to invent some plan of escape. The time now came when I must\r\nbe delivered from the ship or die. I was seized with yellow fever, and\r\nshould certainly take the small-pox with it, and who does not know that\r\nI could not survive the operation of both of these diseases at once. * *\r\n* I assisted in nursing those who had the pox most violently.\r\n\r\n“The arrival of a cartel and my being exchanged would but render my\r\ndeath the more sure.”\r\n\r\nYet he endeavored to promote his exchange by stepping up and giving in\r\nhis name among the first, when a list of the prisoners was taken. Andros\r\nwas not strong, and as he himself says, disease often seemed to pass\r\nover the weak and sickly, and to attack, with deadly result, the\r\nprisoners who were the healthiest and most vigorous.\r\n\r\n“It was the policy of the English to return for sound and healthy men\r\nsent from our prisons, such Americans as had but just the breath of life\r\nin them, sure to die before they reached home. The guard would tell a\r\nman while in health, ‘You haven’t been here long enough, you are too\r\nwell to be exchanged.’\r\n\r\n“There was one more method of getting from the ship,” Andros continues,\r\n“and that was at night to steal down through a gun-port which we had\r\nmanaged to open unbeknown to the guard, and swim ashore.” This, he\r\ndeclared, was for him a forlorn hope. Already under the influence of\r\nyellow fever, and barely able to walk, he was, even when well, unable\r\nto swim ten rods. Discovery was almost certain, for the guards now kept\r\nvigilant watch to prevent any one escaping in this manner, and they shot\r\nall whom they detected in the act of escaping. Yet this poor young man\r\ntrusted in God. He writes: “God, who had something more for me to do,\r\nundertook for me.” Mr. Emery, the sailing master, was going ashore for\r\nwater. Andros stepped up to him and asked: “Mr. Emery, may I go on shore\r\nwith you after water?”\r\n\r\nNo such favor had ever been granted a prisoner, and Andros scarcely knew\r\nwhat prompted him to prefer such a request. To his immense surprise, the\r\nsailing master, who must have had a heart after all, replied, “Yes, with\r\nall my heart.” He was evidently struck with compassion for the poor,\r\napparently dying, young man.\r\n\r\nAndros, to the astonishment of his companions, immediately descended\r\ninto the boat. Some of them asked: “What is that sick man going on shore\r\nfor?”\r\n\r\nThe British sailors endeavored to dissuade him, thinking that he would\r\nprobably die on the excursion.\r\n\r\n“‘So, to put them all to silence, I again ascended on board, for I had\r\nneglected to take my great-coat. But I put it on, and waited for the\r\nsailing-master. The boat was pushed off, I attempted to row, but an\r\nEnglish sailor said, very kindly, ‘Give me the oar. You are too unwell.’\r\n* * * I looked back to the black and unsightly old ship as to an object\r\nof the greatest horror. * * * We ascended the creek and arrived at the\r\nspring, and I proposed to the sailors to go in quest of apples.”\r\n\r\nThe sailing-master said to him, “This fresh air will be of service to\r\nyou.” This emboldened him to ask leave to ascend a bank about\r\nthirty feet high, and to call at a house near the spring to ask for\r\nrefreshment. “Go,” said Mr. Emery, “but take care not to be out of the\r\nway.” He replied that his state of health was such that nothing was\r\nto be feared from him on that account. He managed to get into a small\r\norchard that belonged to the farmhouse. There he saw a sentinel, who was\r\nplaced on guard over a pile of apples. He soon convinced himself\r\nthat this man was indifferent to his movements, and, watching his\r\nopportunity, when the man’s back was turned, he slipped beyond the\r\norchard, into a dense swamp, covered with a thick undergrowth of\r\nsaplings and bushes. Here there was a huge prostrate log twenty feet in\r\nlength, curtained with a dense tangle of green briar.\r\n\r\n“Lifting up this covering I crept in, close by the log, and rested\r\ncomfortably, defended from the northeast storm which soon commenced.”\r\n\r\nHe heard the boat’s crew making inquiries for him but no one discovered\r\nhis hiding-place. One of them declared that he was safe enough, and\r\nwould never live to go a mile. In the middle of the night he left his\r\nhiding place, and fell into a road which he pursued some distance. When\r\nhe heard approaching footsteps he would creep off the path, roll himself\r\nup into a ball to look like a bush, and remain perfectly still until the\r\ncoast was clear. He now felt that a wonderful Providence was watching\r\nover him. His forethought in returning for his overcoat was the means\r\nof saving his life, as he would undoubtedly have perished from exposure\r\nwithout it. Next night he hid in a high stack of hay, suffering greatly.\r\nWhen the storm was over he left this hiding place, and entered a deep\r\nhollow in the woods near by, where he felt secure from observation. Here\r\nhe took off his clothes and spread them in the sun to dry.\r\n\r\nReturning to the road he was proceeding on his way, when at a bend in\r\nthe road, he came upon two light dragoons, evidently looking for him.\r\nWhat was he to do? His mind acted quickly, and, as they approached, he\r\nleisurely got over a fence into a small corn field, near a cottage by\r\nthe way-side. Here he busied himself as if he were the owner of the\r\ncottage, going about the field; deliberately picking up ears of corn;\r\nrighting up the cap sheaf of a stack of stalks, and examining each\r\none. He had lost his hat, and had a handkerchief around his head, which\r\nhelped to deceive the dragoons, who supposed that he had just come out\r\nof the cottage. They eyed him sharply, but passed on.\r\n\r\nAfter this he dared not show himself, and wandered about, living on\r\napples and water. He would lie concealed all day, in barns or hollows of\r\nthe woods. At night he travelled as far as his weakened condition\r\nwould allow He often found unfermented cider at the presses, for it was\r\ncider-making time.\r\n\r\nAfter several days of this wandering life he sought refuge in a barn,\r\nwhere he was found by a cross old man, who refused to do anything for\r\nhim. He says that in the course of his wanderings he uniformly found\r\nwomen kind and helpful. They gave him food and kept his secret. One\r\nnight, feeling utterly spent, he came to the poor dwelling of an old\r\nman and his wife, on the east side of Long Island. These good people\r\nassisted him by every means in their power, as if he were their own son.\r\nThey took off his clothes, giving him another suit until they had baked\r\nall his garments in the oven to destroy the vermin which tormented him\r\nday and night. They insisted upon his occupying a clean bed. That night\r\nhe slept sweetly, rid of the intolerable torture of being eaten up\r\nalive. He managed to reach Sag Harbor, where he found two other escaped\r\nprisoners. Soon he was smuggled to Connecticut in a whale-boat, and\r\nrestored to his mother. It was late in October when he reached home.\r\nHe was very ill and delirious for a long time, but finally recovered,\r\ntaught school for some time, and finally became a minister of the\r\ngospel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\nTHE NARRATIVE OF CAPTAIN DRING\r\n\r\n\r\nBy far the most complete account of life on board the Old Jersey is\r\ncontained in Captain Dring’s Recollections. His nature was hopeful, and\r\nhis constitution strong and enduring. He attempted to make the best of\r\nhis situation, and succeeded in leading as nearly a tolerable life\r\non board the prison-ship as was possible. His book is too long for\r\ninsertion in these pages, but we will endeavor to give the reader an\r\nabstract of it.\r\n\r\nThis book was published in 1865, having been prepared for the press and\r\nannotated by Mr. Albert G. Greene, who speaks of Captain Dring as “a\r\nfrank, outspoken, and honest seaman.” His original manuscript was first\r\npublished in 1829.\r\n\r\nDring describes the prison ships as leaky old hulks, condemned as unfit\r\nfor hospitals or store ships, but considered good enough for prisoners\r\ndoomed to speedy annihilation. He says:\r\n\r\n“There is little doubt that the superior officers of the Royal Navy\r\nunder whose exclusive jurisdiction were these ships, intended to insure,\r\nas far as possible, the good health of those who were confined on board\r\nof them; there is just as little doubt, however, that the inferior\r\nofficers, under whose control those prisoners were more immediately\r\nplaced, * * * too often frustrated the purposes of their superior\r\nofficers, and too often disgraced humanity, by their wilful disregard of\r\nthe policy of their Government, and of the orders of their superiors, by\r\nthe uncalled-for severity of their treatment of those who were placed in\r\ntheir custody, and by their shameless malappropriation of the means\r\nof support which were placed in their hands for the sustenance of the\r\nprisoners.”\r\n\r\nHowever that may be, the superior officers must have known that the\r\nprison ships were unfit for human habitation; that they were fearfully\r\novercrowded; and that the mortality on board of them was unprecedented\r\nin the annals of prison life.\r\n\r\nThe introduction to Captain Drings’s recollections declares, what is\r\nwell known, that General Washington possessed but limited authority; he\r\nwas the Commander-in-Chief of the army, but had nothing to do with the\r\nAmerican Navy, and still less with the crews of privateers, who made up\r\na very large portion of the men on board the Jersey. Yet he did all he\r\ncould, actuated, as he always was, by the purest motives of benevolence\r\nand humanity.\r\n\r\n“The authority to exchange naval prisoners,” to quote from this\r\nintroduction, “was not invested in Washington, but in the Financier, and\r\nas the prisoners on the Jersey freely set forth in their petition, the\r\nformer was comparatively helpless in the premises, although he earnestly\r\ndesired to relieve them from their sufferings.\r\n\r\n“It will be seen from these circumstances that no blame could properly\r\nattach to General Washington, or the Continental Congress, or the\r\nCommissary of Prisoners; the blame belonged to those who were engaged\r\nin privateering, all of whom had been accustomed to release, without\r\nparole, the crews of the vessels which they captured, or enlist them on\r\nother privateers; in both cases removing the very means by which alone\r\nthe release of their captive fellow seamen could be properly and safely\r\neffected.\r\n\r\n“From the careful perusal of all the information we possess on this\r\ninteresting subject, the reader will arise with the conviction that,\r\nby unwarrantable abuses of authority; and unprincipled disregard of the\r\npurposes of the British Government in some of its agents, great numbers\r\nof helpless American prisoners were wantonly plunged into the deepest\r\ndistress; exposed to the most severe sufferings, and carried to\r\nunhonored graves. * * * Enough will remain uncontradicted by competent\r\ntestimony to brand with everlasting infamy all who were immediately\r\nconcerned in the business; and to bring a blush of shame on the cheek of\r\nevery one who feels the least interest in the memory of any one who,\r\nno matter how remotely, was a party to so mean and yet so horrible\r\nan outrage. * * * The authors and abettors of the outrages to which\r\nreference has been made will stand convicted not only of the most\r\nheartless criminality against the laws of humanity and the laws of God,\r\nbut of the most flagrant violation of the Laws of Nations, and the Law\r\nof the Land.”\r\n\r\nThese extracts are all taken from the Introduction to Captain Dring’s\r\nRecollections, written by Mr. H. B. Dawson, in June, 1865.\r\n\r\nCaptain Dring was born in Newport, R. I., on the third of August, 1758.\r\nHe died in August, 1825, in Providence, R. I., and was about 67 years of\r\nage at the time of his death. He was many years in the merchant service,\r\nand wrote his recollections in 1824.\r\n\r\n“I was first confined on the Good Hope, in the year 1779, then lying in\r\nthe North River opposite the city of New York, but after a confinement\r\nof more than four months, I succeeded in making my escape to the Jersey\r\nshore.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Dring is said to have been one of the party who escaped from\r\nthe Good Hope in October, 1779. The New Jersey papers thus described the\r\nescape.\r\n\r\n“Chatham, N. J. Last Wednesday morning about one o’clock made their\r\nescape from the Good Hope prison ship in the North River, nine Captains\r\nand two privates. Among the number was Captain James Prince, who has\r\nbeen confined four months, and having no prospect of being exchanged,\r\nconcerted a plan in conjunction with the other gentlemen to make their\r\nescape, which they effected in the following manner: They confined the\r\nMate, disarmed the sentinels, and hoisted out the boat which was on\r\ndeck; they brought off nine stands of arms, one pair of pistols, and\r\na sufficient quantity of ammunition, being determined not to be taken\r\nalive. They had scarce got clear of the ship before the alarm was given,\r\nwhen they were fired on by three different ships, but fortunately no\r\nperson was hurt. Captain Prince speaks in the highest terms of Captain\r\nCharles Nelson, who commanded the prison-ship, using the prisoners with\r\na great deal of humanity, particularly himself.\r\n\r\n“I was again captured in 1782,” Dring continues, “and conveyed on board\r\nthe Jersey, where * * * I was a witness and partaker of the unspeakable\r\nsufferings of that wretched class of American prisoners who were there\r\ntaught the utmost extreme of human misery. I am now far advanced in\r\nyears, and am the only survivor, with the exception of two, of a crew\r\nof 65 men. I often pass the descendant of one of my old companions in\r\ncaptivity, and the recollection comes fresh to my mind that his father\r\nwas my comrade and fellow sufferer in prison; that I saw him breathe his\r\nlast upon the deck of the Jersey, and assisted at his interment at the\r\nWaleboght; * * *\r\n\r\n“In May, 1782, I sailed from Providence, R. I., as Master’s-mate, on\r\nboard a privateer called the Chance, commanded by Captain Daniel Aborn,\r\nmounting 12 six-pound cannon, and having a crew of 65 men.”\r\n\r\nThis vessel was captured in a few days by the Belisarius, of 26 guns,\r\ncommanded by Captain Graves. The prisoners were brought to New York and\r\nthe Belisarius dropped her anchor abreast of the city. A large gondola\r\nsoon came alongside, in which was seated David Sproat, the much-hated\r\nBritish Commissary of Naval Prisoners. He was an American refugee,\r\nuniversally detested for the insolence of his manners, and the cruelty\r\nof his conduct. The prisoners were ordered into the boats, and told to\r\napply themselves to the oars, but declined to exert themselves in that\r\nmanner, whereupon he scowled at them and remarked, “I’ll soon fix you,\r\nmy lads!”\r\n\r\nDavid Sproat found America too hot for him after the war and died at\r\nKirkcudbright, Scotland, in 1799.\r\n\r\nDring says: “My station in the boat as we hauled alongside, was exactly\r\nopposite one of the air-ports in the side of the ship. From this\r\naperture proceeded a strong current of foul vapor of a kind to which I\r\nhad been before accustomed while confined on board the Good Hope, the\r\npeculiar disgusting smell of which I then recollected, after a lapse\r\nof three years. This was, however, far more foul and loathsome than\r\nanything which I had ever met with on board that ship, and it produced a\r\nsensation of nausea far beyond my powers of description.\r\n\r\n“Here, while waiting for orders to ascend on board, we were addressed\r\nby some of the prisoners from the air-ports * * * after some questions\r\nwhence we came, and respecting the manner of our capture, one of the\r\nprisoners said that it was a lamentable thing to see so many young men\r\nin the prime of health and vigor condemned to a living grave.” He went\r\non to say that Death passed over such human skeletons as himself as\r\nunworthy of his powers, but that he delighted in making the strong, the\r\nyouthful, and the vigorous, his prey.\r\n\r\nAfter the prisoners had been made to descend the hatchways, these were\r\nthen fastened down for the night. Dring says it was impossible for him\r\nto find one of his companions in the darkness.\r\n\r\n“Surrounded by I knew not whom, except that they were beings as wretched\r\nas myself; with dismal sounds meeting my ears from every direction; a\r\nnauseous and putrid atmosphere filling my lungs at every breath; and a\r\nstifling and suffocating heat which almost deprived me of sense, even\r\nof life. Previous to leaving the boat I had put on several articles\r\nof clothing, for the purpose of security, but I was soon compelled to\r\ndisencumber myself of these. * * * Thoughts of sleep did not enter into\r\nmy mind.”\r\n\r\nHe discovered a gleam of light from one of the port-holes and keeping\r\nhold of his bag endeavored to make his way to it, but was greeted by\r\ncurses and imprecations from those who were lying on the deck, and whom\r\nhe disturbed. At length he arrived at the desired spot, but found it\r\noccupied. In the morning he saw himself surrounded by a crowd of forms,\r\nwith the hues of death and famine upon their faces. At eight o’clock\r\nthey were permitted to ascend on deck, and he found some of his friends.\r\n\r\n“Pale and meagre, the throng came on deck, to view for a few moments the\r\nmorning sun, and then to descend again, to pass another day of misery\r\nand wretchedness. I found myself surrounded by a motley crew of\r\nwretches, with tattered garments and pallid visages. * * * Among them I\r\nsaw one ruddy and heathful countenance, and recognized the features of\r\none of my late companions on the Belisarius. But how different did\r\nhe appear from the group around him * * * men who, now shrunken and\r\ndecayed, had but a short time before been as strong, as healthful, and\r\nas vigorous as himself. * * * During the night I had, in addition to my\r\nother sufferings, been tormented with what I supposed to be vermin, and\r\non coming upon deck, I found that a black silk handkerchief, which I\r\nwore around my neck, was completely spotted with them. Although this had\r\noften been mentioned as one of the nuisances of the place, yet as I had\r\nnever before been in a situation to witness anything of the kind, the\r\nsight made me shudder, as I knew at once that as long as I should remain\r\non board, these loathsome creatures would be my constant companions and\r\nunceasing tormentors.\r\n\r\n“The next disgusting object which met my sight was a man suffering from\r\nsmall-pox, and in a few minutes I found myself surrounded by many others\r\nlaboring under the same disease in every stage of its progress.”\r\n\r\nDring was obliged to inoculate himself, as that was thought to be\r\nthe safest way of taking the disease. He borrowed some virus from a\r\nsufferer, and scarified the skin of his hand with a pin. He then bound\r\nup his hand. Next morning he found that it had festered. He took the\r\ndisease lightly, and soon recovered, while a very large proportion of\r\nthose who contracted smallpox in the natural manner died of it.\r\n\r\nAll the prisoners from the Belisarius were obliged to fast for\r\ntwenty-four hours. Dring had some ship biscuit with him, in his bag.\r\nThese he distributed to his companions. They then formed themselves into\r\nmesses of six each, and next morning drew their scanty pittance of food.\r\n\r\nWe have said that Dring and the other officers on board solved the\r\nproblem of living with _comparative_ comfort on board the Jersey. As\r\nthey were officers, the gun-room was given up to their use, and they\r\nwere not so terribly crowded as the common sailors. Also the officers\r\nhad money to supply many of their wants, but all this will appear in the\r\ncourse of the narrative.\r\n\r\nHe says that, even on the second day of their confinement, they could\r\nnot obtain their allowance of food in time to cook it. No distinction of\r\nrank was made by the jailors on the Jersey, but the prisoners themselves\r\nagreed to allow the officers to occupy the extreme afterpart of the\r\nship, between decks, called the gun-room. Dring soon became an inmate\r\nof this place, in company with the other officers who were already in\r\npossession, and these tendered him all the little services in their\r\npower.\r\n\r\nThe different messes were all numbered. At nine o’clock the steward and\r\nhis assistants would take their places at the window in the bulk head in\r\nthe steward’s room, and ring a bell. A man from each mess stood ready\r\nto be in time to answer when his number was called. The rations were all\r\nprepared ready for delivery. They were on two-thirds allowance. This is\r\nthe full allowance for a British seaman:\r\n\r\n  Sunday--1 lb. biscuit, 1 lb. pork, and half a pint of peas.\r\n  Monday--1 lb. biscuit, 1 pint oatmeal, 2 oz. butter.\r\n  Tuesday-1 lb. biscuit, and 2 lbs. beef.\r\n  Wednesday--1-1/2 lbs. flour, and 2 ounces suet.\r\n  Thursday--Same as Sunday.\r\n  Friday--Same as Monday.\r\n  Saturday--Same as Tuesday.\r\n\r\nTwo thirds of this allowance for each man would have been sufficient\r\nto sustain life, had it been of moderately good quality. They never\r\nreceived butter, but a rancid and ill-smelling substance called sweet\r\noil. “The smell of it, accustomed as we were to everything foul and\r\nnauseous, was more than we could endure. We, however, always received\r\nit, and gave it to the poor, half-starved Frenchmen who were on board,\r\nwho took it gratefully, and swallowed it with a little salt and their\r\nwormy bread.”\r\n\r\nOil had been dealt out to the prisoners on the Good Hope, but there it\r\nwas hoarded carefully, for they were allowed lights until nine P.M.,\r\nso they used it in their lamps. But on the Jersey, Dring declares that\r\nneither light nor fire was ever allowed.\r\n\r\nOften their provisions were not dealt out in time to be cooked that day,\r\nand then they had to fast or eat them raw. The cooking was done in\r\nthe “Great Copper” under the forecastle. This was a boiler enclosed in\r\nbrick-work about eight feet square. It was large enough to contain\r\ntwo or three hogsheads of water. It was square, and divided into two\r\nportions. In one side peas and oatmeal were boiled in fresh water. On\r\nthe other side the meat was boiled in salt water, and as we have already\r\nstated the food was poisoned by copperas. This was the cause, it is\r\nbelieved, of many deaths, especially as the water was obtained from\r\nalongside the ship, and was extremely unwholesome.\r\n\r\nThe portion of each mess was designated by a tally fastened to it by a\r\nstring. Hundreds of tallies were to be seen hanging over the sides of\r\nthe brick-work by their strings, each eagerly watched by some member of\r\nthe mess, who waited to receive it.\r\n\r\nThe meat was suffered to remain in the boiler a certain time, then\r\nthe cook’s bell was rung, and the pittance of food must be immediately\r\nremoved, whether sufficiently cooked or not. The proportion of peas and\r\noatmeal belonging to each mess was measured out of the copper after it\r\nwas boiled.\r\n\r\nThe cook alone seemed to have much flesh on his bones. He had been a\r\nprisoner, but seeing no prospect of ever being liberated he had offered\r\nhis services, and his mates and scullions were also prisoners who had\r\nfollowed his example. The cook was not ill-natured, and although\r\noften cursed by the prisoners when out of hearing, he really displayed\r\nfortitude and forbearance far beyond what most men would have been\r\ncapable of showing. “At times, when his patience was exhausted, he\r\ndid, indeed, make the hot water fly among us, but a reconciliation was\r\nusually effected with little difficulty.\r\n\r\n“Many of the different messes had obtained leave from His Majesty the\r\nCook to prepare their own rations, separate from the general mess in the\r\ngreat boiler. For this purpose a great many spikes and hooks had been\r\ndriven into the brick-work by which the boiler was enclosed, on which to\r\nsuspend their tin kettles. As soon as we were permitted to go on deck in\r\nthe morning, some one took the tin kettle belonging to the mess, with as\r\nmuch water and as many splinters of wood as we had been able to procure\r\nduring the previous day, and carried them to the Galley; and there\r\nhaving suspended his kettle on one of the hooks or spikes stood ready to\r\nkindle his little fire as soon as the Cook or his mates would permit.\r\nIt required but little fire to boil our food in these kettles, for their\r\nbottoms were made concave, and the fire was applied directly in the\r\ncentre, and let the remaining brands be ever so small they were all\r\ncarefully quenched; and having been conveyed below were kept for use on\r\na future occasion.\r\n\r\n“Much contention often arose through our endeavors to obtain places\r\naround the brick-work, but these disputes were always promptly decided\r\nby the Cook, from whose mandate there was no appeal. No sooner had one\r\nprisoner completed the cooking for his mess, than another supplicant\r\nstood ready to take his place; and they thus continued to throng the\r\ngalley, during the whole time that the fire was allowed to remain under\r\nthe Great Copper, unless it happened to be the pleasure of the Cook to\r\ndrive them away. *[...] Each man in the mess procured and saved as much\r\nwater as possible during the previous day; as no person was ever allowed\r\nto take more than a pint at a time from the scuttle-cask in which it was\r\nkept. Every individual was therefor obliged each day to save a little\r\nfor the common use of the mess on the next morning. By this arrangement\r\nthe mess to which I belonged had always a small quantity of fresh water\r\nin store, which we carefully kept, with a few other necessaries, in a\r\nchest which we used in common.\r\n\r\n“During the whole period of my confinement I never partook of any food\r\nwhich had been prepared in the Great Copper. It is to this fact that I\r\nhave always attributed, under Divine Providence, the degree of health\r\nwhich I preserved on board. I was thereby also, at times, enabled to\r\nprocure several necessary and comfortable things, such as tea, sugar,\r\netc. so that, wretchedly as I was situated, my condition was far\r\npreferable to that of most of my fellow sufferers, which has ever been\r\nto me a theme of sincere and lasting gratitude to Heaven.\r\n\r\n“But terrible indeed was the condition of most of my fellow captives.\r\nMemory still brings before me those emaciated beings, moving from the\r\nGalley with their wretched pittance of meat; each creeping to the spot\r\nwhere his mess was assembled, to divide it with a group of haggard and\r\nsickly creatures, their garments hanging in tatters round their meagre\r\nlimbs, and the hue of death upon their careworn faces. By these it was\r\nconsumed with the scanty remnants of bread, which was often mouldy and\r\nfilled with worms. And even from this vile fare they would rise up in\r\ntorments from the cravings of unsatisfied hunger and thirst.\r\n\r\n“No vegetables of any description were ever afforded us by our inhuman\r\nkeepers. Good Heaven! what a luxury to us would then have been even a\r\nfew potatoes!--if but the very leavings of swine. * * *\r\n\r\n  “Oh my heart sinks, my pitying eyes o’erflow,\r\n  When memory paints the picture of their woe\r\n  Where my poor countrymen in bondage wait\r\n  The slow enfranchisement of lingering fate,\r\n  Greeting with groans the unwelcome night’s return,\r\n  While rage and shame their gloomy bosoms burn,\r\n  And chiding, every hour, the slow-paced sun,\r\n  Endure their woes till all his race was run\r\n  No one to mark the sufferers with a tear\r\n  No friend to comfort, and no hope to cheer,\r\n  And like the dull, unpitied brutes repair\r\n  To stalls as wretched, and as coarse a fare;\r\n  Thank Heaven one day of misery was o’er,\r\n  And sink to sleep, and wish to wake no more.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\nTHE NARRATIVE OF CAPTAIN DRING (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n\r\n“The quarter-deck of the Jersey covered about one-fourth of the upper\r\ndeck, and the forecastle extended from the stern, about one-eighth\r\npart of the length of the upper deck. Sentinels were stationed on the\r\ngangways on each side of the upper deck, leading from the quarter-deck\r\nto the forecastle. These gangways were about five feet wide; and here\r\nthe prisoners were allowed to pass and repass. The intermediate space\r\nfrom the bulkhead of the quarter-deck to the forecastle was filled with\r\nlong spars and booms, and called the spar-deck. The temporary covering\r\nafforded by the spar-deck was of the greatest benefit to the prisoners,\r\nas it served to shield us from the rain and the scorching rays of the\r\nsun. It was here, therefore, that our movables were placed when we were\r\nengaged in cleaning the lower decks. The spar-deck was also the only\r\nplace where we were allowed to walk, and was crowded through the day by\r\nthe prisoners on deck. Owing to the great number of prisoners, and the\r\nsmall space allowed us by the spar-deck, it was our custom to walk in\r\nplatoons, each facing the same way, and turning at the same time. The\r\nDerrick for taking in wood, water, etc., stood on the starboard side\r\nof the spar-deck. On the larboard side of the ship was placed the\r\naccommodation ladder, leading from the gangway to the water. At the head\r\nof the ladder a sentinel was also stationed.\r\n\r\n“The head of the accommodation ladder was near the door of the\r\nbarricade, which extended across the front of the quarter-deck, and\r\nprojected a few feet beyond the sides of the ship. The barricade was\r\nabout ten feet high, and was pierced with loop-holes for musketry in\r\norder that the prisoners might be fired on from behind it, if occasion\r\nshould require.\r\n\r\n“The regular crew of the ship consisted of a Captain, two Mates, a\r\nSteward, a Corporal, and about 12 sailors. The crew of the ship had no\r\ncommunication whatever with the prisoners. No person was ever permitted\r\nto pass through the barricade door, except when it was required that the\r\nmesses should be examined and regulated, in which case each man had\r\nto pass through, and go between decks, and there remain until the\r\nexamination was completed. None of the guard or of the ship’s crew ever\r\ncame among the prisoners while I was on board. I never saw one of her\r\nofficers or men except when there were passengers going in the boat, to\r\nor from the stern-ladder.\r\n\r\n“On the two decks below, where we were confined at night, our chests,\r\nboxes, and bags were arranged in two lines along the decks, about ten\r\nfeet distant from the sides of the ship; thus leaving as wide a space\r\nunencumbered in the middle of each deck, fore and aft, as our crowded\r\nsituation would admit. Between these tiers of chests, etc., and the\r\nsides of the ship, was the place where the different messes assembled;\r\nand some of the messes were also separated from their neighbors by a\r\ntemporary partition of chests, etc. Some individuals of the different\r\nmesses usually slept on the chests, in order to preserve their contents\r\nfrom being plundered in the night.\r\n\r\n“At night the spaces in the middle of the decks were much encumbered\r\nwith hammocks, but these were always removed in the morning. * * *\r\nMy usual place of abode being in the Gunroom, I was never under the\r\nnecessity of descending to the lower dungeon; and during my confinement\r\nI had no disposition to visit it. It was inhabited by the most wretched\r\nin appearance of all our miserable company. From the disgusting and\r\nsqualid appearance of the groups which I saw ascending the stairs which\r\nled to it, it must have been more dismal, if possible, than that part\r\nof the hulk where I resided. Its occupants appeared to be mostly\r\nforeigners, who had seen and survived every variety of human suffering.\r\nThe faces of many of them were covered with dirt and filth; their long\r\nhair and beards matted and foul; clothed in rags, and with scarcely a\r\nsufficient supply of these to cover their disgusting bodies. Many among\r\nthem possessed no clothing except the remnant of those garments which\r\nthey wore when first brought on board; and were unable to procure even\r\nany material for patching these together, when they had been worn to\r\ntatters by constant use. * * * Some, and indeed many of them, had not\r\nthe means of procuring a razor, or an ounce of soap.\r\n\r\n“Their beards were occasionally reduced by each other with a pair of\r\nshears or scissors. * * * Their skins were discoloured by continual\r\nwashing in salt water, added to the circumstance that it was impossible\r\nfor them to wash their linen in any other manner than by laying it on\r\nthe deck and stamping on it with their feet, after it had been immersed\r\nin salt water, their bodies remaining naked during the process.\r\n\r\n“To men in this situation everything like ordinary cleanliness was\r\nimpossible. Much that was disgusting in their appearance undoubtedly\r\noriginated from neglect, which long confinement had rendered habitual,\r\nuntil it created a confirmed indifference to personal appearance.\r\n\r\n“As soon as the gratings had been fastened over the hatchways for the\r\nnight, we usually went to our sleeping places. It was, of course, always\r\ndesirable to obtain a station as near as possible to the side of the\r\nship, and, if practicable, in the immediate vicinity of one of the\r\nair-ports, as this not only afforded us a better air, but also rendered\r\nus less liable to be trodden upon by those who were moving about the\r\ndecks during the night.\r\n\r\n“But silence was a stranger to our dark abode. There were continual\r\nnoises during the night. The groans of the sick and the dying; the\r\ncurses poured out by the weary and exhausted upon our inhuman keepers;\r\nthe restlessness caused by the suffocating heat, and the confined and\r\npoisonous air, mingled with the wild and incoherent ravings of delirium,\r\nwere the sounds which every night were raised around us in every\r\ndirection. Such was our ordinary situation, but at times the\r\nconsequences of our crowded condition were still more terrible, and\r\nproved fatal to many of our number in a single night.\r\n\r\n“But, strange as it may appear, notwithstanding all the * * * suffering\r\nwhich was there endured I knew many who had been inmates of that abode\r\nfor two years, who were apparently perfectly well. They had, as they\r\nexpressed it, ‘been through the furnace and become seasoned.’ Most of\r\nthese, however, were foreigners, who appeared to have abandoned all hope\r\nof ever being exchanged, and had become quite indifferent with regard to\r\nthe place of their abode.\r\n\r\n“But far different was the condition of that portion of our number who\r\nwere natives of the United States. These formed by far the most numerous\r\nclass of the prisoners. Most of these were young men, * * * who had been\r\ncaptured soon after leaving their homes, and during their first voyage.\r\nAfter they had been here immured the sudden change in their situation\r\nwas like a sentence of death. Many a one was crushed down beneath the\r\nsickness of the heart, so well described by the poet:--\r\n\r\n          “‘Night and day,\r\n  Brooding on what he had been, what he was,\r\n  ‘Twas more than he could bear, his longing fits\r\n  Thickened upon him. _His desire for Home\r\n  Became a madness_’\r\n\r\n“These poor creatures had, in many instances, been plundered of their\r\nwearing apparel by their captors, and here, the dismal and disgusting\r\nobjects by which they were surrounded, the vermin which infested them,\r\nthe vile and loathsome food, and what with _them_ was far from being the\r\nlightest of their trials, their ceaseless longing after their _homes_, *\r\n* * all combined, had a wonderful effect on them. Dejection and anguish\r\nwere soon visible on their countenances. They became dismayed and\r\nterror-stricken; and many of them absolutely died that most awful of all\r\nhuman deaths, the effects of a _broken heart_.\r\n\r\n“A custom had long been established that certain labor which it was\r\nnecessary should be performed daily, should be done by a company,\r\nusually called the ‘Working party.’ This consisted of about twenty\r\nable-bodied men chosen from among the prisoners, and was commanded, in\r\ndaily rotation, by those of our number who had formerly been officers\r\nof vessels. The commander of the party for the day bore the title of\r\nBoatswain. The members of the Working-party received, as a compensation\r\nfor their services, a full allowance of provisions, and half a pint of\r\nrum each, with the privilege of going on deck early in the morning, to\r\nbreathe the pure air.\r\n\r\n“This privilege alone was a sufficient compensation for all the duty\r\nwhich was required of them.\r\n\r\n“Their routine of service was to wash down that part of the upper deck\r\nand gangways where the prisoners were permitted to walk; to spread the\r\nawning, or to hoist on board the wood, water, and other supplies, from\r\nthe boats in which the same were brought alongside the ship.\r\n\r\n“When the prisoners ascended to the upper deck in the morning, if the\r\nday was fair, each carried up his hammock and bedding, which were all\r\nplaced upon the spar-deck, or booms. The Working-party then took the\r\nsick and disabled who remained below, and placed them in the bunks\r\nprepared for them upon the centre-deck; they then, if any of the\r\nprisoners had died during the night, carried up the dead bodies, and\r\nlaid them upon the booms; after which it was their duty to wash down the\r\nmain decks below; during which operation the prisoners remained on\r\nthe upper deck, except such as chose to go below and volunteer their\r\nservices in the performance of this duty.\r\n\r\n“Around the railing of the hatchway leading from the centre to the lower\r\ndecks, were placed a number of large tubs for the occasional use of\r\nthe prisoners during the night, and as general receptacles of filth.\r\nAlthough these were indispensably necessary to us, yet they were highly\r\noffensive. It was a part of the duty of the Working-party to carry these\r\non deck, at the time when the prisoners ascended in the morning, and to\r\nreturn them between decks in the afternoon.\r\n\r\n“Our beds and clothing were kept on deck until nearly the hour when we\r\nwere to be ordered below for the night. During this interval * * * the\r\ndecks washed and cleared of all incumbrance, except the poor wretches\r\nwho lay in the bunks, it was quite refreshing after the suffocating heat\r\nand foul vapors of the night to walk between decks. There was then some\r\ncirculation of air through the ship, and, for a few hours, our existence\r\nwas, in some degree, tolerable.\r\n\r\n“About two hours before sunset the order was usually issued for the\r\nprisoners to carry their hammocks, etc., below. After this had been done\r\nwe were all either to retire between decks, or to remain above until\r\nsunset according to our own pleasure. Everything which we could do\r\nconducive to cleanliness having then been performed, if we ever felt\r\nanything like enjoyment in this wretched abode, it was during this brief\r\ninterval, when we breathed the cool air of the approaching night, and\r\nfelt the luxury of our evening pipe. But short indeed was this interval\r\nof repose. The Working-party was soon ordered to carry the tubs below,\r\nand we prepared to descend to our gloomy and crowded dungeons. This was\r\nno sooner done than the gratings were closed over the hatchways,\r\nthe sentinels stationed, and we left to sicken and pine beneath our\r\naccumulated torments; with our guards above crying aloud, through the\r\nlong night, ‘All’s well!”’\r\n\r\nCaptain Dring says that at that time the Jersey was used for seamen\r\nalone. The average number on board was one thousand. It consisted of the\r\ncrews of vessels of all the nations with which the English were at war.\r\nBut the greater number had been captured on board American vessels.\r\n\r\nThere were three hospital ships in the Wallabout; the Stromboli, the\r\nHunter, and the Scorpion. [Footnote: At one time as we have seen, the\r\nScorpion was a prison ship, from which Freneau was sent to the Hunter\r\nhospital ship.] There was not room enough on board these ships for\r\nall the sick, and a part of the upper deck of the Jersey was therefore\r\nprepared for their accommodation. These were on the after part of the\r\nupper deck, on the larboard side, where those who felt the symptoms of\r\napproaching sickness could lie down, in order to be found by the nurses\r\nas soon as possible.\r\n\r\nFew ever returned from the hospital ships to the Jersey. Dring knew but\r\nthree such instances during his imprisonment. He says that “the outward\r\nappearance of these hospitals was disgusting in the highest degree.\r\nThe sight of them was terrible to us. Their appearance was even more\r\nshocking than that of our own miserable hulk.\r\n\r\n“On board the Jersey among the prisoners were about half a dozen men\r\nknown by the appellation of nurses. I never learned by whom they were\r\nappointed, or whether they had any regular appointment at all. But one\r\nfact I knew well; they were all thieves. They were, however, sometimes\r\nuseful in assisting the sick to ascend from below to the gangway on the\r\nupper deck, to be examined by the visiting Surgeon who attended from\r\nthe Hunter every day, when the weather was good. If a sick man was\r\npronounced by the Surgeon to be a proper subject for one of the hospital\r\nships, he was put into the boat waiting alongside; but not without the\r\nloss or detention of his effects, if he had any, as these were at once\r\ntaken by the nurses, as their own property. * * * I had found Mr. Robert\r\nCarver, our Gunner while on board the Chance, sick in one of the bunks\r\nwhere those retired who wished to be removed. He was without a bed\r\nor pillow, and had put on all the wearing apparel which he possessed,\r\nwishing to preserve it, and being sensible of his situation. I found him\r\nsitting upright in the bunk, with his great-coat on over the rest of\r\nhis garments, and his hat between his knees. The weather was excessively\r\nhot, and, in the place where he lay, the heat was overpowering. I at\r\nonce saw that he was delirious, a sure presage that the end was near. I\r\ntook off his great-coat, and having folded and placed it under his head\r\nfor a pillow, I laid him upon it, and went immediately to prepare him\r\nsome tea. I was absent but a few minutes, and, on returning, met one of\r\nthe thievish Nurses with Carver’s great-coat in his hand. On ordering\r\nhim to return it his reply was that it was a perquisite of the Nurses,\r\nand the only one they had; that the man was dying, and the great-coat\r\ncould be of no further use to him. I however, took possession of the\r\ncoat, and on my liberation, returned it to the family of the owner. Mr\r\nCarver soon after expired where he lay. We procured a blanket in which\r\nto wrap his body, which was thus prepared for interment. Others of the\r\ncrew of the Chance had died before that time. Mr Carver was a man\r\nof strong and robust constitution. Such men were subject to the most\r\nviolent attacks of the fever, and were also its most certain victims.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\nTHE INTERMENT OF THE DEAD\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptain Dring continues his narrative by describing the manner in which\r\nthe dead were interred in the sand of the Wallabout. Every morning, he\r\nsays, the dead bodies were carried to the upper deck and there laid\r\nupon the gratings. Any person who could procure, and chose to furnish,\r\na blanket, was allowed to sew it around the remains of his departed\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\n“The signal being made, a boat was soon seen approaching from the\r\nHunter, and if there were any dead on board the other ships, the boat\r\nreceived them, on her way to the Jersey.\r\n\r\n“The corpse was laid upon a board, to which some ropes were attached\r\nas straps; as it was often the case that bodies were sent on shore for\r\ninterment before they had become sufficiently stiff to be lowered into\r\nthe boat by a single strap. Thus prepared a tackle was attached to the\r\nboard, and the remains * * * were hoisted over the side of the ship into\r\nthe boat, without further ceremony. If several bodies were waiting for\r\ninterment, but one of them was lowered into the boat at a time, for the\r\nsake of decency. The prisoners were always very anxious to be engaged in\r\nthe duty of interment, not so much from a feeling of humanity, or from\r\na wish to pay respect to the remains of the dead, for to these feelings\r\nthey had almost become strangers, as from the desire of once more\r\nplacing their feet on the land, if but for a few minutes. A sufficient\r\nnumber of prisoners having received permission to assist in this duty,\r\nthey entered the boat accompanied by a guard of soldiers, and put off\r\nfrom the ship.\r\n\r\n“I obtained leave to assist in the burial of the body of Mr. Carver, * *\r\n* and after landing at a low wharf which had been built from the shore,\r\nwe first went to a small hut, which stood near the wharf, and was used\r\nas a place of deposit for the handbarrows and shovels provided for these\r\noccasions. Having placed the corpses on the barrows, and received\r\nour hoes and shovels, we proceeded to the side of the bank near the\r\nWaleboght. Here a vacant space having been selected, we were directed\r\nto dig a trench in the sand, of a proper length for the reception of\r\nthe bodies. We continued our labor until the guards considered that a\r\nsufficient space had been excavated. The corpses were then laid in the\r\ntrench without ceremony, and we threw the sand over them. The whole\r\nappeared to produce no more effect upon our guards than if they were\r\nburying the bodies of dead animals, instead of men. They scarcely\r\nallowed us time to look about us; for no sooner had we heaped the earth\r\nupon the trench, than we were ordered to march. But a single glance was\r\nsufficient to show us parts of many bodies which were exposed to view,\r\nalthough they had probably been placed there with the same mockery of\r\ninterment but a few days before.\r\n\r\n“Having thus performed, as well as we were permitted to do it, the last\r\nduty to the dead, and the guards having stationed themselves on each\r\nside of us, we began reluctantly to retrace our steps to the boat. We\r\nhad enjoyed the pleasure of breathing for a few minutes the air of our\r\nnative soil; and the thought of return to the crowded prison-ship was\r\nterrible in the extreme. As we passed by the waterside we implored\r\nour guards to allow us to bathe, or even to wash ourselves for a few\r\nminutes, but this was refused us.\r\n\r\n“I was the only person of our party who wore a pair of shoes, and well\r\nrecollect that I took them off for the pleasure of feeling the earth,\r\nor rather the sand, as we went along. * * * We went by a small patch\r\nof turf, some pieces of which we tore up from the earth, and obtained\r\npermission to carry them on board for our comrades to smell them.\r\nCircumstances like these may appear trifling to the careless reader; but\r\nlet him be assured that they were far from being trifles to men situated\r\nas we had been. The inflictions which we had endured; the duty which we\r\nhad just performed; the feeling that we must, in a few minutes, re-enter\r\nthe place of suffering, from which, in all probability, we should never\r\nreturn alive; all tended to render everything connected with the firm\r\nland beneath, and the sweet air above us, objects of deep and thrilling\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n“Having arrived at the hut we there deposited our implements, and\r\nwalked to the landing-place, where we prevailed on our guards, who were\r\nHessians, to allow us the gratification of remaining nearly half an hour\r\nbefore we returned to the boat.\r\n\r\n“Near us stood a house occupied by a miller, and we had been told that\r\na tide-mill which he attended was in the immediate vicinity, as a\r\nlanding-place for which the wharf where we stood had been erected. * *\r\n* It was designated by the prisoners by the appellation of the ‘Old\r\nDutchman’s,’ and its very walls were viewed by us with feelings of\r\nveneration, as we had been told that the amiable daughter of its owner\r\nhad kept an accurate account of the number of bodies that had been\r\nbrought on shore for interment from the Jersey and hospital ships. This\r\ncould easily be done in the house, as its windows commanded a fair view\r\nof the landing place. We were not, however, gratified by a sight of\r\nherself, or of any other inmate of the house.\r\n\r\n“Sadly did we approach and re-enter our foul and disgusting place of\r\nconfinement. The pieces of turf which we carried on board were sought\r\nfor by our fellow prisoners, with the greatest avidity, every fragment\r\nbeing passed by them from hand to hand, and its smell inhaled as if it\r\nhad been a fragrant rose. * * * The first of the crew of the Chance to\r\ndie was a lad named Palmer, about twelve years of age, and the youngest\r\nof our crew. When on board the Chance he was a waiter to the officers,\r\nand he continued in this duty after we were placed on board the Jersey.\r\nHe had, with many others of our crew, been inoculated for the small-pox,\r\nimmediately after our arrival on board. The usual symptoms appeared\r\nat the proper time, and we supposed the appearance of his disorder\r\nfavorable, but these soon changed, and the yellow hue of his features\r\ndeclared the approach of death. * * * The night he died was truly a\r\nwretched one for me. I spent most of it in total darkness, holding him\r\nduring his convulsions. * * * I had done everything in my power for this\r\npoor boy, during his sickness, and could render him but one more kind\r\noffice (after his death). I assisted to sew a blanket around his body,\r\nwhich was, with others who had died, during the night, conveyed upon\r\ndeck in the morning, to be at the usual hour hurried to the bank at the\r\nWalebocht. I regretted that I could not assist at his interment, as I\r\nwas then suffering with the small-pox myself, neither am I certain that\r\npermission would have been granted me, if I had sought it. Our keepers\r\nappeared to have no idea that the prisoners could feel any regard for\r\neach other, but appeared to think us as cold-hearted as themselves. If\r\nanything like sympathy was ever shown us by any of them it was done\r\nby the Hessians. * * * The next deaths among our company were those of\r\nThomas Mitchell and his son-in-law, Thomas Sturmey. It is a singular\r\nfact that both of these men died at the same time.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GUARDS ON BOARD THE JERSEY\r\n\r\n“In addition to the regular officers and seamen of the Jersey, there\r\nwere stationed on board about a dozen old invalid Marines, but our\r\nactual guard was composed of soldiers from the different regiments\r\nquartered on Long Island. The number usually on duty on board was\r\nabout thirty. Each week they were relieved by a fresh party. They were\r\nEnglish, Hessian, and Refugees. We always preferred the Hessians,\r\nfrom whom we received better treatment than from the others. As to the\r\nEnglish, we did not complain, being aware that they merely obeyed their\r\norders, in regard to us; but the Refugees * * * were viewed by us with\r\nscorn and hatred. I do not recollect, however, that a guard of these\r\nmiscreants was placed over us more than three times, during which their\r\npresence occasioned much tumult and confusion; for the prisoners could\r\nnot endure the sight of these men, and occasionally assailed them with\r\nabusive language, while they, in turn, treated us with all the severity\r\nin their power. We dared not approach near them, for fear of their\r\nbayonets, and of course could not pass along the gangways where they\r\nwere stationed; but were obliged to crawl along upon the booms, in order\r\nto get fore and aft, or to go up and down the hatchways. They never\r\nanswered any of our remarks respecting them, but would merely point to\r\ntheir uniforms, as much as to say, ‘We are clothed by our Sovereign,\r\nwhile you are naked.’ They were as much gratified by the idea of leaving\r\nus as we were at seeing them depart.\r\n\r\n“Many provoking gestures were made by the prisoners as they left the\r\nship, and our curses followed them as far as we could make ourselves\r\nheard.\r\n\r\n“A regiment of Refugees, with a green uniform, were then quartered at\r\nBrooklyn. We were invited to join this Royal band, and to partake of his\r\nMajesty’s pardon and bounty. But the prisoners, in the midst of their\r\nunbounded sufferings, of their dreadful privations, and consuming\r\nanguish, spurned the insulting offer. They preferred to linger and to\r\ndie rather than desert their country’s cause. During the whole period\r\nof my confinement I never knew a single instance of enlistment among the\r\nprisoners of the Jersey.\r\n\r\n“The only duty, to my knowledge, ever performed by the old Marines was\r\nto guard the water-butt, near which one of them was stationed with a\r\ndrawn cutlass. They were ordered to allow no prisoner to carry away more\r\nthan one pint at once, but we were allowed to drink at the butt as much\r\nas we pleased, for which purpose two or three copper ladles were chained\r\nto the cask. Having been long on board and regular in performance of\r\nthis duty, they had become familiar with the faces of the prisoners, and\r\ncould, in many instances, detect the frauds which we practiced upon them\r\nin order to obtain more fresh water for our cooking than was allowed\r\nus by the regulations of the ship. Over the water the sailors had no\r\ncontrol. The daily consumption of water on board was at least equal to\r\n700 gallons. I know not whence it was brought, but presume it was from\r\nBrooklyn. One large gondola, or boat, was kept in constant employment to\r\nfurnish the necessary supply.\r\n\r\n“So much of the water as was not required on deck for immediate use was\r\nconducted into butts, placed in the lower hold of the hulk, through a\r\nleather hose, passing through her side, near the bends. To this water we\r\nhad recourse, when we could procure no other.\r\n\r\n“When water in any degree fit for use was brought on board, it is\r\nimpossible to describe the struggle which ensued, in consequence of our\r\nhaste and exertions to procure a draught of it. The best which was\r\never afforded us was very brackish, but that from the ship’s hold was\r\nnauseous in the highest degree. This must be evident when the fact is\r\nstated that the butts for receiving it had never been cleaned since they\r\nwere put in the hold. The quantity of foul sediment which they contained\r\nwas therefore very great, and was disturbed and mixed with the water\r\nas often as a new supply was poured into them, thereby rendering their\r\nwhole contents a substance of the most disgusting and poisonous nature.\r\nI have not the least doubt that the use of this vile compound caused\r\nthe death of hundreds of the prisoners, when, to allay their tormenting\r\nthirst, they were driven by desperation to drink this liquid poison, and\r\nto abide the consequences.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\nDAME GRANT AND HER BOAT\r\n\r\n\r\n“One indulgence was allowed us by our keepers, if indulgence it can be\r\ncalled. They had given permission for a boat to come alongside the ship,\r\nwith a supply of a few necessary articles, to be sold to such of the\r\nprisoners as possessed the means of paying for them. This trade was\r\ncarried on by a very corpulent old woman, known among us by the name of\r\nDame Grant. Her visits, which were made every other day, were of much\r\nbenefit to us, and, I presume, a source of profit to herself. She\r\nbrought us soft bread and fruit, with various other articles, such as\r\ntea, sugar, etc., all of which she previously put up into small paper\r\nparcels, from one ounce to a pound in weight, with the price affixed\r\nto each, from which she would never deviate. The bulk of the old lady\r\ncompletely filled the stern sheets of the boat, where she sat, with her\r\nbox of goods before her, from which she supplied us very expeditiously.\r\nHer boat was rowed by two boys, who delivered to us the articles we had\r\npurchased, the price of which we were required first to put into their\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n“When our guard was not composed of Refugees, we were usually permitted\r\nto descend to the foot of the Accommodation-ladder, in order to select\r\nfrom the boat such articles as we wished. While standing there it was\r\ndistressing to see the faces of hundreds of half-famished wretches,\r\nlooking over the side of the ship into the boat, without the means of\r\npurchasing the most trifling article before their sight, not even so\r\nmuch as a morsel of wholesome bread. None of us possessed the means of\r\ngenerosity, nor had any power to afford them relief. Whenever I bought\r\nany articles from the boat I never enjoyed them; for it was impossible\r\nto do so in the presence of so many needy wretches, eagerly gazing at my\r\npurchase, and almost dying for want of it.\r\n\r\n“We frequently furnished Dame Grant with a memorandum of such articles\r\nas we wished her to procure for us, such as pipes, tobacco, needles,\r\nthread, and combs. These she always faithfully procured and brought to\r\nus, never omitting the assurance that she afforded them exactly at cost.\r\n\r\n“Her arrival was always a subject of interest to us; but at length she\r\ndid not make her appearance for several days, and her appearance was\r\nawaited in extreme anxiety. But, alas! we were no longer to enjoy this\r\nlittle gratification. Her traffic was ended. She had taken the fever\r\nfrom the hulk, and died * * * leaving a void which was never afterwards\r\nfilled up.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\nTHE SUPPLIES FOR THE PRISONERS\r\n\r\n\r\n“After the death of Dame Grant, we were under the necessity of puchasing\r\nfrom the Sutler such small supplies as we needed. This man was one of\r\nthe Mates of the ship, and occupied one of the apartments under the\r\nquarter-deck, through the bulkhead of which an opening had been cut,\r\nfrom which he delivered his goods. He here kept for sale a variety of\r\narticles, among which was usually a supply of ardent spirits, which\r\nwas not allowed to be brought alongside the ship, for sale. It could,\r\ntherefore, only be procured from the Sutler, whose price was two dollars\r\nper gallon. Except in relation to this article, no regular price was\r\nfixed for what he sold us. We were first obliged to hand him the money,\r\nand he then gave us such a quantity as he pleased of the article which\r\nwe needed; there was on our part no bargain to be made, but to be\r\nsupplied even in this manner was, to those of us who had means of\r\npayment, a great convenience. * * *\r\n\r\n“Our own people afforded us no relief. O my country! Why were we thus\r\nneglected in this hour of our misery, why was not a little food and\r\nraiment given to the dying martyrs of thy cause?\r\n\r\n“Although the supplies which some of us were enabled to procure from\r\nthe Sutler were highly conducive to our comfort, yet one most necessary\r\narticle neither himself nor any other person could furnish. This was\r\nwood for our daily cooking, to procure a sufficient quantity of which\r\nwas to us a source of continual trouble and anxiety. The Cooks would\r\nindeed steal small quantities, and sell them to us at the hazard\r\nof certain punishment if detected; but it was not in their power to\r\nembezzle a sufficient quantity to meet our daily necessities. As the\r\ndisgust at swallowing any food which had been cooked in the Great Copper\r\nwas universal, each person used every exertion to procure as much wood\r\nas possible, for the private cooking of his own mess.\r\n\r\n“During my excursion to the shore to assist in the interment of Mr.\r\nCarver, it was my good fortune to find a hogshead stave floating in the\r\nwater. This was truly a prize I conveyed the treasure on board, and in\r\nthe economical manner in which it was used, it furnished the mess to\r\nwhich I belonged with a supply of fuel for a considerable time.\r\n\r\n“I was also truly fortunate on another occasion. I had, one day,\r\ncommanded the Working-party, which was then employed in taking on board\r\na sloop-load of wood for the sailors’ use. This was carefully conveyed\r\nbelow, under a guard, to prevent embezzlement. I nevertheless found\r\nmeans, with the assistance of my associates, to convey a cleft of\r\nit into the Gunroom, where it was immediately secreted. Our mess was\r\nthereby supplied with a sufficient quantity for a long time, and its\r\nmembers were considered by far the most wealthy persons in all this\r\nrepublic of misery. We had enough for our own use, and were enabled,\r\noccasionally, to supply our neighbors with a few splinters.\r\n\r\n“Our mode of preparing the wood was to cut it with a jack-knife into\r\npieces about four inches long. This labor occupied much of our time, and\r\nwas performed by the different members of our mess in rotation, which\r\nemployment was to us a source of no little pleasure.\r\n\r\n“After a sufficient quantity had been thus prepared for the next day’s\r\nuse, it was deposited in the chest. The main stock was guarded by day\r\nand night, with the most scrupulous and anxious care. We kept it at\r\nnight within our enclosure, and by day it was always watched by some\r\none of its proprietors. So highly did we value it that we went into\r\nmathematical calculation to ascertain how long it would supply us, if a\r\ngiven quantity was each day consumed.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR BY-LAWS\r\n\r\n“Soon after the Jersey was first used as a place of confinement a\r\ncode of by-laws had been established by the prisoners, for their own\r\nregulation and government; to which a willing submission was paid, so\r\nfar as circumstances would permit. I much regret my inability to give\r\nthese rules verbatim, but I cannot at this distant period of time\r\nrecollect them with a sufficient degree of distinctness. They were\r\nchiefly directed to the preservation of personal cleanliness, and the\r\nprevention of immorality. For a refusal to comply with any of them,\r\nthe refractory person was subjected to a stated punishment. It is an\r\nastonishing fact that any rules, thus made, should have so long existed\r\nand been enforced among a multitude of men situated as we were, so\r\nnumerous and composed of that class of human beings who are not easily\r\ncontrolled, and usually not the most ardent supporters of good order.\r\nThere were many foreigners among our number, over whom we had no\r\ncontrol, except so far as they chose, voluntarily, to submit to our\r\nregulations, which they cheerfully did, in almost every instance, so far\r\nas their condition would allow. Among our rules were the following. That\r\npersonal cleanliness should be preserved, as far as was practicable;\r\nthat profane language should be avoided; that drunkenness should not\r\nbe allowed; that theft should be severely punished, and that no smoking\r\nshould be permitted between decks, by day or night, on account of the\r\nannoyance which it caused the sick.\r\n\r\n“A due observance of the Sabbath was also strongly enjoined; and it\r\nwas recommended to every individual to appear cleanly shaved on Sunday\r\nmorning, and to refrain from all recreation during the day.\r\n\r\n“This rule was particularly recommended to the attention of the\r\nofficers, and the remainder of the prisoners were desired to follow\r\ntheir example.\r\n\r\n“Our By-laws were occasionally read to the assembled prisoners, and\r\nalways whenever any person was to be punished for their violation. Theft\r\nor fraud upon the allowance of a fellow prisoner was always punished,\r\nand the infliction was always approved by the whole company. On these\r\noccasions the oldest officer among the prisoners presided as Judge. It\r\nrequired much exertion for many of us to comply with the law prohibiting\r\nsmoking between decks. Being myself much addicted to the habit of\r\nsmoking, it would have been a great privilege to have enjoyed the\r\nliberty of thus indulging it, particularly during the night, while\r\nsitting by one of the air-ports; but as this was inadmissible, I of\r\ncourse submitted to the prohibition. * * * We were not allowed means of\r\nstriking a fire, and were obliged to procure it from the Cook employed\r\nfor the ship’s officers, through a small window in the bulkhead, near\r\nthe caboose. After one had thus procured fire the rest were also soon\r\nsupplied, and our pipes were all in full operation in the course of\r\na few minutes. The smoke which rose around us appeared to purify\r\nthe pestilent air by which we were surrounded; and I attribute the\r\npreservation of my health, in a great degree, to the exercise of this\r\nhabit. Our greatest difficulty was to procure tobacco. This, to some of\r\nthe prisoners, was impossible, and it must have been an aggravation to\r\ntheir sufferings to see us apparently puffing away our sorrows, while\r\nthey had no means of procuring the enjoyment of a similar gratification.\r\n\r\n“We dared not often apply at this Cook’s caboose for fire, and the surly\r\nwretch would not willingly repeat the supply. One morning I went to\r\nthe window of his den, and requested leave to light my pipe, and the\r\nmiscreant, without making any reply, threw a shovel full of burning\r\ncinders in my face. I was almost blinded by the pain; and several days\r\nelapsed before I fully regained my sight. My feelings on this occasion\r\nmay be imagined, but redress was impossible, as we were allowed no means\r\nof even seeking it. I mention this occurrence to show to what a wretched\r\ncondition we were reduced.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ORATOR OF THE JERSEY\r\n\r\n“During the period of my confinement the Jersey was never visited by any\r\nregular clergyman, nor was Divine service ever performed on board, and\r\namong the whole multitude of prisoners there was but one individual\r\nwho ever attempted to deliver a set speech, or to exhort his fellow\r\nsufferers. This individual was a young man named Cooper, whose station\r\nin life was apparently that of a common sailor. He evidently possessed\r\ntalents of a very high order. His manners were pleasing, and he had\r\nevery appearance of having received an excellent education. He was a\r\nVirginian; but I never learned the exact place of his nativity. He told\r\nus that he had been a very unmanageable youth, and that he had left\r\nhis family, contrary to their wishes and advice; that he had been often\r\nassured by them that the Old Jersey would bring him up at last, and the\r\nWaleboght be his place of burial. ‘The first of these predictions,’\r\nsaid he, ‘has been verified; and I care not how soon the second proves\r\nequally true, for I am prepared for the event. Death, for me, has lost\r\nits terrors, for with them I have been too long familiar.’\r\n\r\n“On several Sunday mornings Cooper harangued the prisoners in a very\r\nforcible yet pleasing manner, which, together with his language, made\r\na lasting impression upon my memory. On one of these occasions, having\r\nmounted upon a temporary elevation upon the Spar-deck, he, in an audible\r\nvoice, requested the attention of the prisoners, who having immediately\r\ngathered around him in silence, he commenced his discourse.\r\n\r\n“He began by saying that he hoped no one would suppose he had taken that\r\nstation by way of derision or mockery of the holy day, for that such\r\nwas not his object; on the contrary he was pleased to find that the good\r\nregulations established by the former prisoners, obliged us to refrain\r\neven from recreation on the Sabbath; that his object, however, was not\r\nto preach to us, nor to discourse upon any sacred subject; he wished to\r\nread us our By-laws, a copy of which he held in his hand, the framers of\r\nwhich were then, in all probability, sleeping in death, beneath the sand\r\nof the shore before our eyes. That these laws had been framed in wisdom,\r\nand were well fitted to preserve order and decorum in a community like\r\nours: that his present object was to impress upon our minds the absolute\r\nnecessity of a strict adherence to those wholesome regulations; that he\r\nshould briefly comment upon each article, which might be thus considered\r\nas the particular text of that part of his discourse.\r\n\r\n“He proceeded to point out the extreme necessity of a full observance of\r\nthese Rules of Conduct, and portrayed the evil consequences which would\r\ninevitably result to us if we neglected or suffered them to fall into\r\ndisuse. He enforced the necessity of our unremitting attention to\r\npersonal cleanliness, and to the duties of morality; he dwelt upon the\r\ndegradation and sin of drunkeness; described the meanness and atrocity\r\nof theft; and the high degree of caution against temptation necessary\r\nfor men who were perhaps standing on the very brink of the grave; and\r\nadded that, in his opinion, even sailors might as well refrain from\r\nprofane language, while they were actually suffering in Purgatory.\r\n\r\n“He said that our present torments, in that abode of misery, were a\r\nproper retribution for our former sins and transgressions; that Satan\r\nhad been permitted to send out his messengers and inferior demons in\r\nevery direction to collect us together, and that among the most active\r\nof these infernal agents was David Sproat, Commissary of Prisoners.\r\n\r\n“He then made some just and suitable observations on the fortitude with\r\nwhich we had sustained the weight of our accumulated miseries; of our\r\nfirmness in refusing to accept the bribes of our invaders, and desert\r\nthe banners of our country. During this part of his discourse the\r\nsentinels on the gangways occasionally stopped and listened attentively.\r\nWe much feared that by some imprudent remark, he might expose himself to\r\ntheir resentment, and cautioned him not to proceed too far. He replied\r\nour keepers could do nothing more, unless they should put him to the\r\ntorture, and that he should proceed.\r\n\r\n“He touched on the fact that no clergyman had ever visited us; that\r\nthis was probably owing to the fear of contagion; but it was much to\r\nbe regretted that no one had ever come to afford a ray of hope, or to\r\nadminister the Word of Life in that terrific abode; that if any Minister\r\nof the Gospel desired to do so, there could be no obstacles in the way,\r\nfor that even David Sproat himself, bad as he was, would not dare to\r\noppose it.\r\n\r\n“He closed with a merited tribute to the memory of our fellow-sufferers,\r\nwho had already passed away. ‘The time,’ said he, ‘will come when\r\ntheir bones will be collected, when their rites of sepulchre will be\r\nperformed, and a monument erected over the remains of those who\r\nhave here suffered, the victims of barbarity, and who have died in\r\nvindication of the rights of man.’\r\n\r\n“The remarks of our Orator were well adapted to our situation, and\r\nproduced much effect on the prisoners, who at length began to accost him\r\nas Elder or Parson Cooper. But this he would not allow; and told us,\r\nif we would insist on giving him a title, we might call him Doctor, by\r\nwhich name he was ever afterwards saluted, so long as he remained among\r\nus.\r\n\r\n“He had been a prisoner for about the period of three months when\r\none day the Commissary of Prisoners came on board, accompanied by a\r\nstranger, and inquired for Cooper, who having made his appearance, a\r\nletter was put in his hand, which he perused, and immediately after left\r\nthe ship, without even going below for his clothing. While in the boat\r\nhe waived his hand, and bade us be of good cheer. We could only return a\r\nmute farewell; and in a few minutes the boat had left the ship, and was\r\non its way to New York.\r\n\r\n“Thus we lost our Orator, for whom I had a very high regard, at the\r\ntime, and whose character and manners have, ever since, been to me a\r\nsubject of pleasing recollection.\r\n\r\n“Various were the conjectures which the sudden manner of his departure\r\ncaused on board. Some asserted that poor Cooper had drawn upon himself\r\nthe vengeance of old Sproat, and that he had been carried on shore to be\r\npunished. No certain information was ever received respecting him, but I\r\nhave always thought that he was a member of some highly influential and\r\nrespectable family, and that his release had been effected through\r\nthe agency of his friends. This was often done by the influence of the\r\nRoyalists or Refugees of New York, who were sometimes the connections or\r\npersonal friends of those who applied for their assistance in procuring\r\nthe liberation of a son or a brother from captivity. Such kind offices\r\nwere thus frequently rendered to those who had chosen opposite sides in\r\nthe great revolutionary contest, and to whom, though directly opposed to\r\nthemselves in political proceedings, they were willing to render every\r\npersonal service in their power.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\nFOURTH OF JULY ON THE JERSEY\r\n\r\n\r\nA few days before the fourth of July we had made such preparations as\r\nour circumstances would admit for an observance of the anniversary of\r\nAmerican Independence. We had procured some supplies with which to make\r\nourselves merry on the occasion, and intended to spend the day in such\r\ninnocent pastimes as our situation would afford, not dreaming that our\r\nproceeding would give umbrage to our keepers, as it was far from our\r\nintention to trouble or insult them. We thought that, though prisoners,\r\nwe had a right, on that day at least, to sing and be merry. As soon as\r\nwe were permitted to go on deck in the morning thirteen little national\r\nflags were displayed in a row on the boom. We were soon ordered by the\r\nguards to take them away; and as we neglected to obey the command, they\r\ntriumphantly demolished, and trampled them under foot. Unfortunately for\r\nus our guards at that time were Scotch, who, next to the Refugees, were\r\nthe objects of our greatest hatred; but their destruction of our flags\r\nwas merely viewed in silence, with the contempt which it merited.\r\n\r\n“During the time we remained on deck several patriotic songs were sung,\r\nand choruses repeated; but not a word was intentionally spoken to give\r\noffence to our guards. They were, nevertheless, evidently dissatisfied\r\nwith our proceedings, as will soon appear. Their moroseness was a\r\nprelude to what was to follow. We were, in a short time, forbidden to\r\npass along the common gangway, and every attempt to do so was repelled\r\nby the bayonet. Although thus incommoded our mirth still continued.\r\nSongs were still sung, accompanied by occasional cheers. Things thus\r\nproceeded until about four o’clock; when the guards were ordered\r\nout, and we received orders to descend between decks, where we were\r\nimmediately driven, at the point of the bayonet.\r\n\r\n“After being thus sent below in the greatest confusion, at that early\r\nand unusual hour, and having heard the gratings closed and fastened\r\nabove us, we supposed that the barbarous resentment of our guards was\r\nfully satisfied; but we were mistaken, for they had further vengeance in\r\nstore, and merely waited for an opportunity to make us feel its weight.\r\n\r\n“The prisoners continued their singing between decks, and were, of\r\ncourse, more noisy than usual, but forbore even under their existing\r\ntemptations, to utter any insulting or aggravating expressions. At\r\nleast, I heard nothing of the kind, unless our patriotic songs could be\r\nthus constructed. In the course of the evening we were ordered to desist\r\nfrom making any further noise. This order not being fully complied\r\nwith, at about nine o’clock the gratings were removed, and the guards\r\ndescended among us, with lanterns and drawn cutlasses in their hands.\r\nThe poor, helpless prisoners retreated from the hatchways, as far as\r\ntheir crowded situation would permit, while their cowardly assailants\r\nfollowed as far as they dared, cutting and wounding every one\r\nwithin reach, and then ascended to the upper deck, exulting in the\r\ngratification of their revenge.\r\n\r\n“Many of the prisoners were wounded, but from the total darkness,\r\nneither their number, nor their situation could be ascertained; and, if\r\nthis had been possible, it was not in the power of their compatriots\r\nto afford them the least relief. During the whole of that tragic night,\r\ntheir groans and lamentations were dreadful in the extreme. Being in the\r\nGun-room I was at some distance from the immediate scene of this bloody\r\noutrage, but the distance was by no means far enough to prevent my\r\nhearing their continual cries from the extremity of pain, their\r\nappeals for assistance, and their curses upon the heads of their brutal\r\nassailants.\r\n\r\n“It had been the usual custom for each person to carry below, when he\r\ndescended at sunset, a pint of water, to quench his thirst during the\r\nnight. But, on this occasion, we had thus been driven to our dungeon\r\nthree hours before the setting of the sun, and without our usual supply\r\nof water.\r\n\r\n“Of this night I cannot describe the horror. The day had been sultry,\r\nand the heat was extreme throughout the ship. The unusual number of\r\nhours during which we had been crowded together between decks; the\r\nfoul atmosphere and sickening heat; the additional excitement and\r\nrestlessness caused by the unwonted wanton attack which had been made;\r\nabove all, the want of water, not a drop of which could be obtained\r\nduring the whole night, to cool our parched lips; the imprecations of\r\nthose who were half distracted with their burning thirst; the shrieks\r\nand wails of the wounded; the struggles and groans of the dying;\r\ntogether formed a combination of horrors which no pen can describe.\r\n\r\n“In the agonies of their sufferings the prisoners invited, and even\r\nchallenged their inhuman guards to descend once more among them, but\r\nthis they were prudent enough not to attempt.\r\n\r\n“Their cries and supplications for water were terrible, and were of\r\nthemselves sufficient to render sleep impossible. Oppressed with the\r\nheat, I found my way to the grating of the main hatchway, where on\r\nformer nights I had frequently passed some time, for the benefit of the\r\nlittle current of air which circulated through the bars. I obtained a\r\nplace on the larboard side of the hatchway, where I stood facing the\r\nEast, and endeavored, as much as possible, to withdraw my attention\r\nfrom the terrible sounds below me, by watching, through the grating, the\r\nprogress of the stars. I there spent hour after hour, in following with\r\nmy eyes the motion of a particular star, as it rose and ascended until\r\nit passed over beyond my sight.\r\n\r\n“How I longed for the day to dawn! At length the morning light began\r\nto appear, but still our torments were increasing every moment. As\r\nthe usual hour for us to ascend to the upper deck approached, the\r\nWorking-party were mustered near the hatchway, and we were all anxiously\r\nwaiting for the opportunity to cool our weary frames, to breathe for\r\nawhile the pure air, and, above all, to procure water to quench our\r\nintolerable thirst. The time arrived, but still the gratings were not\r\nremoved. Hour after hour passed on, and still we were not released. Our\r\nminds were at length seized with horror, suspicious that our tyrants\r\nhad determined to make a finishing stroke of their cruelty, and rid\r\nthemselves of us altogether.\r\n\r\n“It was not until ten o’clock in the forenoon that the gratings were at\r\nlast removed. We hurried on deck and thronged to the water cask, which\r\nwas completely exhausted before our thirst was allayed. So great was\r\nthe struggle around the cask that the guards were again turned out to\r\ndisperse the crowd.\r\n\r\n“In a few hours, however, we received a new supply of water, but it\r\nseemed impossible to allay our thirst, and the applications at the cask\r\nwere incessant until sunset. Our rations were delivered to us, but of\r\ncourse long after the usual hour. During the whole day, however, no fire\r\nwas kindled for cooking in the galley. All the food which we consumed\r\nthat day we were obliged to swallow raw. Everything, indeed, had been\r\nentirely deranged by the events of the past night, and several days\r\nelapsed before order was restored. This was at last obtained by a\r\nchange of the guard, who, to our great joy, were relieved by a party\r\nof Hessians. The average number who died during a period of 24 hours\r\non board the Jersey was about six, [Footnote: This was in 1782. The\r\nmortality had been much greater in former years.] but on the morning of\r\nthe fifth of July eight or ten corpses were found below. Many had been\r\nbadly wounded, to whom, in the total darkness of the night, it was\r\nimpossible for their companions to render any assistance; and even\r\nduring the next day they received no attention, except that which was\r\nafforded by their fellow prisoners, who had nothing to administer\r\nto their companions, not even bandages for their wounds. I was not\r\npersonally acquainted with any of those who died or were wounded on that\r\nnight. No equal number had ever died in the same period of time since\r\nmy confinement. This unusual mortality was of course caused by the\r\nincreased sufferings of the night. Since that time I have often, while\r\nstanding on the deck of a good ship under my command, and viewing the\r\nrising stars, thought upon the horrors of that night, when I stood\r\nwatching their progress through the gratings of the Old Jersey, and when\r\nI now contrast my former wretchedness with my present situation, in the\r\nfull enjoyment of liberty, health, and every earthly comfort, I cannot\r\nbut muse upon the contrast, and bless the good and great Being from whom\r\nmy comforts have been derived. I do not now regret my capture nor my\r\nsufferings, for the recollection of them has ever taught me how to\r\nenjoy my after life with a greater degree of contentment than I should,\r\nperhaps, have otherwise ever experienced.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL\r\n\r\nAN ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt had been for some time in contemplation among a few inmates of\r\nthe Gun-room to make a desperate attempt to escape, by cutting a hole\r\nthrough the stern or counter of the ship. In order that their operations\r\nmight proceed with even the least probability of success, it was\r\nabsolutely necessary that but few of the prisoners should be admitted\r\nto the secret. At the same time it was impossible for them to make any\r\nprogress in their labor unless they first confided their plan to all\r\nthe other occupants of the Gun-room, which was accordingly done. In this\r\npart of the ship each mess was on terms of more or less intimacy with\r\nthose whose little sleeping enclosures were immediately adjacent to\r\ntheir own, and the members of each mess frequently interchanged good\r\noffices with those in their vicinity, and borrowed or lent such little\r\narticles as they possessed, like the good housewives of a sociable\r\nneighborhood. I never knew any contention in this apartment, during\r\nthe whole period of my confinement. Each individual in the Gun-room\r\ntherefore was willing to assist his comrades, as far as he had the power\r\nto do so. When the proposed plan for escape was laid before us, although\r\nit met the disapprobation of by far the greater number, still we were\r\nall perfectly ready to assist those who thought it practicable. We,\r\nhowever, described to them the difficulties and dangers which must\r\nunavoidably attend their undertaking; the prospect of detection while\r\nmaking the aperture in the immediate vicinity of such a multitude of\r\nidle men, crowded together, a large proportion of whom were always kept\r\nawake by their restlessness and sufferings during the night; the little\r\nprobability that they would be able to travel, undiscovered, on Long\r\nIsland, even should they succeed in reaching the shore in safety; and\r\nabove all, the almost absolute impossibility of obtaining food for their\r\nsubsistence, as an application for that to our keepers would certainly\r\nlead to detection. But, notwithstanding all our arguments, a few of\r\nthem remained determined to make the attempt. Their only reply to our\r\nreasoning was, that they must die if they remained, and that nothing\r\nworse could befall them if they failed in their undertaking.\r\n\r\n“One of the most sanguine among the adventurers was a young man named\r\nLawrence, the mate of a ship from Philadelphia. He was a member of\r\nthe mess next to my own, and I had formed with him a very intimate\r\nacquaintance. He frequently explained his plans to me; and dwelt much on\r\nhis hopes. But ardently as I desired to obtain my liberty, and great\r\nas were the exertions I could have made, had I seen any probability\r\nof gaining it, yet it was not my intention to join in this attempt.\r\nI nevertheless agreed to assist in the labor of cutting through the\r\nplanks, and heartily wished, although I had no hope, that the enterprise\r\nmight prove successful.\r\n\r\n“The work was accordingly commenced, and the laborers concealed, by\r\nplacing a blanket between them and the prisoners without. The counter of\r\nthe ship was covered with hard oak plank, four inches thick; and through\r\nthis we undertook to cut an opening sufficiently large for a man to\r\ndescend; and to do this with no other tools than our jack knives and a\r\nsingle gimlet. All the occupants of the Gun-room assisted in this labor\r\nin rotation; some in confidence that the plan was practicable, and the\r\nrest for amusement, or for the sake of being employed. Some one of our\r\nnumber was constantly at work, and we thus continued, wearing a hole\r\nthrough the hard planks, from seam to seam, until at length the solid\r\noak was worn away piecemeal, and nothing remained but a thin sheathing\r\non the outside which could be cut away at any time in a few minutes,\r\nwhenever a suitable opportunity should occur for making the bold attempt\r\nto leave the ship.\r\n\r\n“It had been previously agreed that those who should descend through the\r\naperture should drop into the water, and there remain until all those\r\namong the inmates of the Gun-room who chose to make the attempt could\r\njoin them; and that the whole band of adventurers should then swim\r\ntogether to the shore, which was about a quarter of a mile from the\r\nship.\r\n\r\n“A proper time at length arrived. On a very dark and rainy night, the\r\nexterior sheathing was cut away; and at midnight four of our number\r\nhaving disencumbered themselves of their clothes and tied them across\r\ntheir shoulders, were assisted through the opening, and dropped one\r\nafter another into the water.\r\n\r\n“Ill-fated men! Our guards had long been acquainted with the enterprise.\r\nBut instead of taking any measures to prevent it, they had permitted us\r\nto go on with our labor, keeping a vigilant watch for the moment of\r\nour projected escape, in order to gratify their bloodthirsty wishes. No\r\nother motive than this could have prompted them to the course which they\r\npursued. A boat was in waiting under the ship’s quarter, manned with\r\nrowers and a party of the guards. They maintained a profound silence\r\nafter hearing the prisoners drop from the opening, until having\r\nascertained that no more would probably descend, they pursued the\r\nswimmers, whose course they could easily follow by the sparkling of the\r\nwater,--an effect always produced by the agitation of the waves in a\r\nstormy night.\r\n\r\n“We were all profoundly silent in the Gun-room, after the departure\r\nof our companions, and in anxious suspense as to the issue of the\r\nadventure. In a few minutes we were startled by the report of a\r\ngun, which was instantly succeeded by a quick and scattering fire of\r\nmusketry. In the darkness of the night, we could not see the unfortunate\r\nvictims, but could distinctly hear their shrieks and cries for mercy.\r\n\r\n“The noise of the firing had alarmed the prisoners generally, and the\r\nreport of the attempted escape and its defeat ran like wildfire through\r\nthe gloomy and crowded dungeons of the hulk, and produced much commotion\r\namong the whole body of prisoners. In a few moments, the gratings were\r\nraised, and the guards descended, bearing a naked and bleeding man,\r\nwhom they placed in one of the bunks, and having left a piece of burning\r\ncandle by his side, they again ascended to the deck, and secured the\r\ngratings.\r\n\r\n“Information of this circumstance soon reached the Gun-room; and myself,\r\nwith several others of our number, succeeded in making our way through\r\nthe crowd to the bunks. The wounded man was my friend, Lawrence. He was\r\nseverely injured in many places, and one of his arms had been nearly\r\nsevered from his body by the stroke of a cutlass. This, he said, was\r\ndone in wanton barbarity, while he was crying for mercy, with his hand\r\non the gunwale of the boat. He was too much exhausted to answer any\r\nof our questions; and uttered nothing further, except a single inquiry\r\nrespecting the fate of Nelson, one of his fellow adventurers. This we\r\ncould not answer. Indeed, what became of the rest we never knew. They\r\nwere probably all murdered in the water. This was the first time that I\r\nhad ever seen a light between decks. The piece of candle had been left\r\nby the side of the bunk, in order to produce an additional effect upon\r\nthe prisoners. Many had been suddenly awakened from their slumbers, and\r\nhad crowded round the bunk where the sufferer lay. The effect of the\r\npartial light upon his bleeding and naked limbs, and upon the pale and\r\nhaggard countenances, and tattered garments of the wild and crowded\r\ngroups by whom he was surrounded, was horrid beyond description. We\r\ncould render the sufferer but little assistance, being only able to\r\nfurnish him with a few articles of apparel, and to bind a handkerchief\r\naround his head. His body was completely covered, and his hair filled\r\nwith clotted blood; we had not the means of washing the gore from his\r\nwounds during the night. We had seen many die, but to view this wretched\r\nman expire in that situation, where he had been placed beyond the reach\r\nof surgical aid, merely to strike us with terror, was dreadful.\r\n\r\n“The gratings were not removed at the usual hour in the morning, but we\r\nwere all kept below until ten o’clock. This mode of punishment had now\r\nbecome habitual with our keepers, and we were all frequently detained\r\nbetween decks until a late hour in the day, in revenge for the most\r\ntrifling occasion. This cruelty never failed to produce the torments\r\narising from heat and thirst, with all their attendant miseries.\r\n\r\n“The immediate purpose of our tyrants having been answered by leaving\r\nMr. Lawrence below in that situation they promised in the morning that\r\nhe should have the assistance of a surgeon, but that promise was not\r\nfulfilled. The prisoners rendered him every attention in their power,\r\nbut in vain. Mortification soon commenced; he became delirious and died.\r\n\r\n“No inquiry was made by our keepers respecting his situation. They\r\nevidently left him thus to suffer, in order that the sight of his\r\nagonies might deter the rest of the prisoners from following his\r\nexample.\r\n\r\n“We received not the least reprimand for this transaction. The aperture\r\nwas again filled up with plank and made perfectly secure, and no similar\r\nattempt to escape was made,--at least so long as I remained on board.\r\n\r\n“It was always in our power to knock down the guards and throw them\r\noverboard, but this would have been of no avail. If we had done so,\r\nand had effected our escape to Long Island, it would have been next\r\nto impossible for us to have proceeded any further among the number of\r\ntroops there quartered. Of these there were several regiments, and among\r\nthem the regiment of Refugees before mentioned, who were vigilant in\r\nthe highest degree, and would have been delighted at the opportunity of\r\napprehending and returning us to our dungeons.\r\n\r\n“There were, however, several instances of individuals making their\r\nescape. One in particular, I well recollect,--James Pitcher, one of\r\nthe crew of the Chance, was placed on the sick list and conveyed to\r\nBlackwell’s Island. He effected his escape from thence to Long Island;\r\nfrom whence, after having used the greatest precaution, he contrived to\r\ncross the Sound, and arrived safe at home. He is now one of the three\r\nsurvivors of the crew of the Chance.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI\r\n\r\nTHE MEMORIAL TO GENERAL WASHINGTON\r\n\r\n  “The body maddened by the spirit’s pain;\r\n  The wild, wild working of the breast and brain;\r\n  The haggard eye, that, horror widened, sees\r\n  Death take the start of hunger and disease.\r\n  Here, such were seen and heard;--so close at hand,\r\n  A cable’s length had reached them from the land;\r\n  Yet farther off than ocean ever bore;--\r\n  Eternity between them and the shore!”\r\n   --W. Read.\r\n\r\n“Notwithstanding the destroying pestilence which was now raging to\r\na degree hitherto unknown on board, new companies of victims were\r\ncontinually arriving; so that, although the mortality was very great,\r\nour numbers were increasing daily. Thus situated, and seeing no prospect\r\nof our liberty by exchange, we began to despair, and to believe that our\r\ncertain fate was rapidly approaching.\r\n\r\n“One expedient was at length proposed among us and adopted. We\r\npetitioned General Clinton, who was then in command of the British\r\nforces at New York, for leave to transmit a Memorial to General\r\nWashington, describing our deplorable situation, and requesting his\r\ninterference in our behalf. We further desired that our Memorial might\r\nbe examined by the British General, and, if approved by him, that it\r\nmight be carried by one of our own number to General Washington. Our\r\npetition was laid before the British commander and was granted by the\r\nCommissary of Prisoners. We received permission to choose three from\r\nour number, to whom was promised a pass-port, with leave to proceed\r\nimmediately on their embassy.\r\n\r\n“Our choice was accordingly made, and I had the satisfaction to find\r\nthat two of those elected were from among the former officers of the\r\nChance, Captain Aborn and our Surgeon, Mr. Joseph Bowen.\r\n\r\n“The Memorial was soon completed and signed in the name of all the\r\nprisoners, by a Committee appointed for that purpose. It contained an\r\naccount of the extreme wretchedness of our condition, and stated that\r\nalthough we were sensible that the subject was one over which General\r\nWashington had no direct control, as it was not usual for soldiers to\r\nbe exchanged for seamen, and his authority not extending to the Marine\r\nDepartment of the American service; yet still, although it might not be\r\nin his power to effect an exchange, we hoped he would be able to devise\r\nsome means to lighten or relieve our sufferings.\r\n\r\n“Our messengers were further charged with a verbal commission to General\r\nWashington, which, for obvious reasons, was not included in the written\r\nMemorial. They were directed to state, in a manner more circumstantial\r\nthan we had dared to write, the peculiar horrors of our situation; to\r\ndiscover the miserable food and putrid water on which we were doomed to\r\nsubsist; and finally to assure the General that in case he could effect\r\nour release, we would agree to enter the American service as soldiers,\r\nand remain during the war. Thus instructed our messengers departed.\r\n\r\n“We waited in alternate hope and fear, the event of their mission. Most\r\nof our number, who were natives of the Eastern States, were strongly\r\nimpressed with the idea that some means would be devised for our relief,\r\nafter such a representation of our condition should be made. This class\r\nof the prisoners, indeed, felt most interested in the success of the\r\napplication; for many of the sufferers appeared to give themselves but\r\nlittle trouble respecting it, and some among the foreigners did not\r\ncommonly know that such an appeal had been made, or that it had even\r\nbeen in contemplation. The long endurance of their privations had\r\nrendered them almost indifferent to their fate, and they appeared\r\nto look forward to death as the only probable termination of their\r\ncaptivity.\r\n\r\n“In a few days our messengers returned to New York, with a letter from\r\nGeneral Washington, addressed to the Committee of Prisoners who had\r\nsigned the Memorial. The prisoners were all summoned to the Spar-deck\r\nwhere this letter was read. Its purport was as follows:--That he had\r\nperused our communication, and had received, with due consideration,\r\nthe account which our messengers had laid before him; that he viewed\r\nour situation with a high degree of interest, and that although our\r\napplication, as we had stated, was made in relation to a subject over\r\nwhich he had no direct control, yet that it was his intention to lay\r\nour Memorial before Congress; and that, in the mean time, we might be\r\nassured that no exertions on his part should be spared which could tend\r\nto a mitigation of our sufferings.\r\n\r\n“He observed to our messengers, during their interview, that our long\r\ndetention in confinement was owing to a combination of circumstances,\r\nagainst which it was very difficult, if not impossible, to provide.\r\nThat, in the first place, but little exertion was made on the part of\r\nour countrymen to secure and detain their British prisoners for the sake\r\nof exchange, many of the British seamen being captured by privateers, on\r\nboard which, he understood, it was a common practice for them to enter\r\nas seamen; and that when this was not the case, they were usually set\r\nat liberty as soon as the privateers arrived in port; as neither the\r\nowners, nor the town or State where they were landed, would be at the\r\nexpense of their confinement and maintenance; and that the officers\r\nof the General Government only took charge of those seamen who were\r\ncaptured by the vessels in public service. All which circumstances\r\ncombined to render the number of prisoners, at all times, by far too\r\nsmall for a regular and equal exchange.\r\n\r\n“General Washington also transmitted to our Committee copies of letters\r\nwhich he had sent to General Clinton and to the Commissary of Prisoners,\r\nwhich were also read to us. He therein expressed an ardent desire that\r\na general exchange of prisoners might be effected; and if this could not\r\nbe accomplished, he wished that something might be done to lessen the\r\nweight of our sufferings, that, if it was absolutely necessary that we\r\nshould be confined on the water, he desired that we might at least be\r\nremoved to clean ships. He added if the Americans should be driven to\r\nthe necessity of placing the British prisoners in situations similar\r\nto our own, similar effects must be the inevitable results; and that he\r\ntherefore hoped they would afford us better treatment from motives\r\nof humanity. He concluded by saying, that as a correspondence on\r\nthe subject had thus begun between them, he ardently wished it might\r\neventually result in the liberation of the unfortunate men whose\r\nsituation had called for its commencement.\r\n\r\n“Our three messengers did not return on board as prisoners, but were all\r\nto remain on parole at Flatbush, on Long Island.\r\n\r\n“We soon found an improvement in our fare. The bread which we received\r\nwas of a better quality, and we were furnished with butter, instead of\r\nrancid oil. An awning was provided, and a wind-sail furnished to conduct\r\nfresh air between the decks during the day. But of this we were always\r\ndeprived at night, when we most needed it, as the gratings must always\r\nbe fastened over the hatchway and I presume that our keepers were\r\nfearful if it was allowed to run, we might use it as a means of escape.\r\n\r\n“We were, however, obliged to submit to all our privations, consoling\r\nourselves only with the faint hope that the favorable change in our\r\nsituation, which we had observed for the last few days, might lead to\r\nsomething still more beneficial, although we saw little prospect\r\nof escape from the raging pestilence, except through the immediate\r\ninterposition of divine Providence, or by a removal from the scene of\r\ncontagion.”\r\n\r\n_Note_. From the _New Jersey Gazette_, July 24th, 1782. “New London.\r\nJuly 21st. We are informed that Sir Guy Carleton has visited all the\r\nprison ships at New York, minutely examined into the situation of the\r\nprisoners, and expressed his intention of having them better provided\r\nfor. That they were to be landed on Blackwell’s Island, in New York\r\nharbour, in the daytime, during the hot season.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII\r\n\r\nTHE EXCHANGE\r\n\r\n\r\n“Soon after Captain Aborn had been permitted to go to Long Island on\r\nhis parole, he sent a message on board the Jersey, informing us that his\r\nparole had been extended so far as to allow him to return home, but that\r\nhe should visit us previous to his departure. He requested our First\r\nLieutenant, Mr. John Tillinghast, to provide a list of the names of\r\nthose captured in the Chance who had died, and also a list of the\r\nsurvivors, noting where each survivor was then confined, whether on\r\nboard the Jersey, or one of the Hospital ships.\r\n\r\n“He also requested that those of our number who wished to write to their\r\nfriends at home, would have their letters ready for delivery to him,\r\nwhenever he should come on board. The occupants of the Gun-room, and\r\nsuch of the other prisoners as could procure the necessary materials\r\nwere, therefore, soon busily engaged in writing as particular\r\ndescriptions of our situation as they thought it prudent to do, without\r\nthe risk of the destruction of the letters; as we were always obliged to\r\nsubmit our writing for inspection previous to its being allowed to pass\r\nfrom the ship. We, however, afterwards regretted that on this occasion\r\nour descriptions were not more minute, as these letters were not\r\nexamined.\r\n\r\n“The next day Captain Aborn came on board, accompanied by several other\r\npersons, who had also been liberated on parole; but they came no nearer\r\nto the prisoners than the head of the gangway-ladder, and passed through\r\nthe door of the barricade to the Quarter-deck. This was perhaps a\r\nnecessary precaution against the contagion, as they were more liable to\r\nbe affected by it than if they had always remained on board; but we were\r\nmuch disappointed at not having an opportunity to speak to them. Our\r\nletters were delivered to Captain Aborn by our Lieutenant, through whom\r\nhe sent us assurances of his determination to do everything in his power\r\nfor our relief, and that if a sufficient number of British prisoners\r\ncould be procured, every survivor of his vessel’s crew should be\r\nexchanged; and if this could not be effected we might depend upon\r\nreceiving clothing and such other necessary articles as could be sent\r\nfor our use.\r\n\r\n“About this time some of the sick were sent on shore on Blackwell’s\r\nIsland. This was considered a great indulgence. I endeavored to obtain\r\nleave to join them by feigning sickness, but did not succeed.\r\n\r\n“The removal of the sick was a great relief to us, as the air was less\r\nfoul between decks, and we had more room for motion. Some of the bunks\r\nwere removed, and the sick were carried on shore as soon as their\r\ncondition was known. Still, however, the pestilence did not abate on\r\nboard, as the weather was extremely warm. In the daytime the heat was\r\nexcessive, but at night it was intolerable.\r\n\r\n“But we lived on hope, knowing that, in all probability, our friends at\r\nhome had ere then been apprised of our condition, and that some relief\r\nmight perhaps be soon afforded us.\r\n\r\n“Such was our situation when, one day, a short time before sunset, we\r\ndescribed a sloop approaching us, with a white flag at her mast-head,\r\nand knew, by that signal, that she was a Cartel, and from the direction\r\nin which she came supposed her to be from some of the Eastern States.\r\nShe did not approach near enough to satisfy our curiosity, until we were\r\nordered below for the night.\r\n\r\n“Long were the hours of the night to the survivors of our crew. Slight\r\nas was the foundation on which our hopes had been raised, we had clung\r\nto them as our last resource. No sooner were the gratings removed in the\r\nmorning than we were all upon deck, gazing at the Cartel. Her deck was\r\ncrowded with men, whom we supposed to be British prisoners. In a few\r\nmoments they began to enter the Commissary’s boats, and proceeded to New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\n“In the afternoon a boat from the Cartel came alongside the hulk, having\r\non board the Commissary of Prisoners, and by his side sat our townsman,\r\nCaptain William Corey, who came on board with the joyful information\r\nthat the sloop was from Providence with English prisoners to be\r\nexchanged for the crew of the Chance. The number which she had brought\r\nwas forty, being more than sufficient to redeem every survivor of our\r\ncrew then on board the Jersey.\r\n\r\n“I immediately began to prepare for my departure. Having placed the\r\nfew articles of clothing which I possessed in a bag (for, by one of\r\nour By-laws, no prisoner, when liberated, could remove his chest) I\r\nproceeded to dispose of my other property on board, and after having\r\nmade sundry small donations of less value, I concluded by giving my tin\r\nkettle to one of my friends, and to another the remnant of my cleft of\r\nfirewood.\r\n\r\n“I then hurried to the upper deck, in order to be ready to answer to my\r\nname, well knowing that I should hear no second call, and that no delay\r\nwould be allowed.\r\n\r\n“The Commissary and Captain Corey were standing together on the\r\nQuarter-deck; and as the list of names was read, our Lieutenant, Mr.\r\nTillinghast, was directed to say whether the person called was one\r\nof the crew of the Chance. As soon as this assurance was given, the\r\nindividual was ordered to pass down the Accommodation ladder into the\r\nboat. Cheerfully was the word ‘Here!’ responded by each survivor as his\r\nname was called. My own turn at length came, and the Commissary pointed\r\nto the boat. I never moved with a lighter step, for that moment was the\r\nhappiest of my life. In the excess and overflowing of my joy, I even\r\nforgot, for awhile, the detestable character of the Commissary himself,\r\nand even, Heaven forgive me! bestowed a bow upon him as I passed.\r\n\r\n“We took our stations in the boat in silence. No congratulations were\r\nheard among us. Our feelings were too deep for utterance. For my own\r\npart, I could not refrain from bursting into tears of joy.\r\n\r\n“Still there were moments when it seemed impossible that we were in\r\nreality without the limits of the Old Jersey. We dreaded the idea that\r\nsome unforeseen event might still detain us; and shuddered with the\r\napprehension that we might yet be returned to our dungeons.\r\n\r\n“When the Cartel arrived the surviving number of our crew on board\r\nthe Old Jersey was but thirty-five. This fact being well known to Mr.\r\nTillinghast, and finding that the Cartel had brought forty prisoners, he\r\nallowed five of our comrades in the Gun-room to answer to the names of\r\nthe same number of our crew who had died; and having disguised them in\r\nthe garb of common seamen, they passed unsuspected.\r\n\r\n“It was nearly sunset when we had all arrived on board the Cartel. No\r\nsooner had the exchange been completed than the Commissary left us, with\r\nour prayers that we might never behold him more. I then cast my eyes\r\ntowards the hulk, as the horizontal rays of the sunset glanced on her\r\npolluted sides, where, from the bend upwards, filth of every description\r\nhad been permitted to accumulate for years; and the feeling of disgust\r\nwhich the sight occasioned was indescribable. The multitude on her\r\nSpar-deck and Fore-castle were in motion, and in the act of descending\r\nfor the night; presenting the same appearance that met my sight when,\r\nnearly five months before, I had, at the same hour, approached her as a\r\nprisoner.”\r\n\r\nIt appears that many other seamen on board the Jersey and the Hospital\r\nships were exchanged as a good result of the Memorial addressed to\r\nGeneral Washington. An issue of the _Royal Gazette_ of New York,\r\npublished on the 17th of July, 1782, contains the following statement:\r\n\r\n“The following is a Statement of the Navy Prisoners who have, within the\r\nlast few days, been exchanged and brought to this city, viz:\r\n\r\n“From Boston, 102 British Seamen. “From Rhode Island, 40 British Seamen.\r\n“From New London, Conn., 84 British Seamen. “From Baltimore, Md, 23\r\nBritish Seamen. “Total 249.\r\n\r\n“The exertions of those American Captains who published to the world in\r\nthis _Gazette_, dated July 3rd, the real state and condition of their\r\ncountrymen, prisoners here, and the true cause of their durance and\r\nsufferings, we are informed was greatly conducive to the bringing this\r\nexchange into a happy effect. We have only to lament that the endeavors\r\nof those who went, for the same laudable purpose, to Philadelphia, have\r\nnot hitherto been so fortunate.”\r\n\r\nThis was published before the release of Captain Dring and the crew of\r\nthe Chance, and shows that they were not the only prisoners who were so\r\nhappy as to be exchanged that summer. It is possible that the crew\r\nof the Chance is referred to in this extract from the _Pennsylvania\r\nPacket_, Philadelphia, Thursday, August 15th, 1782: “Providence, July\r\n27th. Sunday last a flag of truce returned here from New York, and\r\nbrought 39 prisoners.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII\r\n\r\nTHE CARTEL--CAPTAIN DRING’S NARRATIVE (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n\r\n“On his arrival in Providence Captain Aborn had lost no time in making\r\nthe details of our sufferings publicly known; and a feeling of deep\r\ncommiseration was excited among our fellow citizens. Messrs. Clarke and\r\nNightingale, the former owners of the Chance, in conjunction with other\r\ngentlemen, expressed their determination to spare no exertion or expense\r\nnecessary to procure our liberty. It was found that forty British\r\nprisoners were at that time in Boston. These were immediately procured,\r\nand marched to Providence, where a sloop owned and commanded by a\r\nCaptain Gladding of Bristol was chartered, to proceed with the prisoners\r\nforthwith to New York, that they might be exchanged for an equal number\r\nof our crew. Captain Corey was appointed as an Agent to effect the\r\nexchange, and to receive us from the Jersey; and having taken on board\r\na supply of good provisions and water, he hastened to our relief. He\r\nreceived much assistance in effecting his object from our townsman,\r\nMr. John Creed, at that time Deputy Commissary of Prisoners. I do not\r\nrecollect the exact day of our deliverance, but think it was early in\r\nthe month of October * * * We were obliged to pass near the shore of\r\nBlackwell’s Island, where were several of our crew, who had been sent on\r\nshore among the sick. They had learned that the Cartel had arrived from\r\nProvidence for the purpose of redeeming the crew of the Chance, and\r\nexpected to be taken on board. Seeing us approaching they had, in order\r\nto cause no delay, prepared for their departure, and stood together on\r\nthe shore, with their bundles in their hands; but, to their unutterable\r\ndisappointment and dismay, they saw us pass by. We knew them and\r\nbitterly did we lament the necessity of leaving them behind. We\r\ncould only wave our hands as we passed; but they could not return the\r\nsalutation, and stood as if petrified with horror, like statues fixed\r\nimmovably to the earth, until we had vanished from their sight.\r\n\r\n“I have since seen and conversed with one of these unfortunate men, who\r\nafterwards made his escape. He informed me that their removal from the\r\nJersey to the Island was productive of the most beneficial effects upon\r\ntheir health, and that they had been exulting at the improvement of\r\ntheir condition; but their terrible disappointment overwhelmed them with\r\ndespair. They then considered their fate inevitable, believing that in a\r\nfew days they must again be conveyed on board the hulk; there to undergo\r\nall the agonies of a second death. * * * Several of our crew were sick\r\nwhen we entered the Cartel, and the sudden change of air and diet caused\r\nsome new cases of fever. One of our number, thus seized by the fever,\r\nwas a young man named Bicknell of Barrington, R. I. He was unwell when\r\nwe left the Jersey, and his symptoms indicated the approaching fever;\r\nand when we entered Narragansett Bay, he was apparently dying. Being\r\ninformed that we were in the Bay he begged to be taken on deck, or at\r\nleast to the hatchway, that he might look once more upon his native\r\nland. He said that he was sensible of his condition; that the hand of\r\ndeath was upon him; but that he was consoled by the thought that he\r\nshould be decently interred, and be suffered to rest among his friends\r\nand kindred. I was astonished at the degree of resignation and composure\r\nwith which he spoke. He pointed to his father’s house, as we approached\r\nit, and said it contained all that was dear to him upon earth. He\r\nrequested to be put on shore.\r\n\r\n“Our Captain was intimately acquainted with the family of the sufferer;\r\nand as the wind was light we dropped our anchor, and complied with his\r\nrequest. He was placed in the boat, where I took a seat by his side; in\r\norder to support him; and, with two boys at the oars, we left the\r\nsloop. In a few minutes his strength began rapidly to fail. He laid his\r\nfainting head upon my shoulder, and said he was going to the shore to\r\nbe buried with his ancestors; that this had long been his ardent desire,\r\nand that God had heard his prayers. No sooner had we touched the shore\r\nthan one of the boys was sent to inform his family of the event. They\r\nhastened to the boat to receive their long lost son and brother, but we\r\ncould only give them his yet warm and lifeless corpse.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR ARRIVAL HOME\r\n\r\n“After remaining a few moments with the friends of our deceased comrade\r\nwe returned to the sloop and proceeded up the river. It was about\r\neight o’clock in the evening when we reached Providence. There were no\r\nquarantine regulations to detain us; but, as the yellow fever was raging\r\namong us, we took the precaution to anchor in the middle of the stream.\r\nIt was a beautiful moonlit evening, and the intelligence of our arrival\r\nhaving spread through the town, the nearest wharf was in a short time\r\ncrowded with people drawn together by curiosity, and a desire for\r\ninformation relative to the fate of their friends and connections.\r\n\r\n“Continual inquiries were made from the anxious crowd on the land\r\nrespecting the condition of several different individuals on board. At\r\nlength the information was given that some of our number were below,\r\nsick with the yellow fever. No sooner was this fact announced than\r\nthe wharf was totally deserted, and in a few moments not a human being\r\nremained in sight. The Old Jersey fever as it was called, was well known\r\nthroughout the whole country. All were acquainted with its terrible\r\neffects; and it was shunned as if its presence were certain destruction.\r\n\r\n“After the departure of the crowd, the sloop was brought alongside the\r\nwharf, and every one who could walk immediately sprang on shore. So\r\ngreat was the dread of the pestilence, and so squalid and emaciated were\r\nthe figures which we presented, that those among us whose families did\r\nnot reside in Providence found it almost impossible to gain admittance\r\ninto any dwelling. There being at that time no hospital in or near the\r\ntown, and no preparations having been made for the reception of the\r\nsick, they were abandoned for that night. They were, however, supplied\r\nin a few hours with many small articles necessary for their immediate\r\ncomfort, by the humane people in the vicinity of the wharf. The friends\r\nof the sick who belonged in the vicinity of the town were immediately\r\ninformed of our arrival, and in the course of the following day these\r\nwere removed from the vessel. For the remainder of the sufferers ample\r\nprovision was made through the generous exertions of Messrs. Clarke and\r\nNightingale.\r\n\r\n“Solemn indeed are the reflections which crowd upon my mind as I review\r\nthe events which are here recorded. Forty-two years have passed away\r\nsince this remnant of our ill-fated crew were thus liberated from their\r\nwasting captivity. In that time what changes have taken place! Of their\r\nwhole number but three are now alive. James Pitcher, Dr. Joseph Bowen,\r\nand myself, are the sole survivors. Of the officers I alone remain.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV\r\n\r\nCORRESPONDENCE OF WASHINGTON AND OTHERS\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Washington cannot with justice be blamed for any part of the\r\nsufferings inflicted upon the naval prisoners on board the prison ships.\r\nAlthough he had nothing whatever to do with the American Navy, or the\r\ncrews of privateers captured by the British, yet he exerted himself\r\nin every way open to him to endeavor to obtain their exchange, or,\r\nat least, a mitigation of their sufferings, and this in spite of the\r\nimmense weight of cares and anxieties that devolved upon him in his\r\nconduct of the war. Much of his correspondence on the subject of these\r\nunfortunate prisoners has been given to the world. We deem it necessary,\r\nin a work of this character, to reproduce some of it here, not only\r\nbecause this correspondence is his most perfect vindication from the\r\ncharge of neglect that has been brought against him, but also because it\r\nhas much to do with the proper understanding of this chronicle.\r\n\r\nOne of the first of the letters from which we shall quote was written by\r\nWashington from his headquarters to Admiral Arbuthnot, then stationed at\r\nNew York, on the 25th of January 1781.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nThrough a variety of channels, representations of too serious a nature\r\nto be disregarded have come to us, that the American naval prisoners in\r\nthe harbor of New York are suffering all the extremity of distress,\r\nfrom a too crowded and in all respects disagreeable and unwholesome\r\nsituation, on board the Prison-ships, and from the want of food and\r\nother necessaries. The picture given us of their sufferings is truly\r\ncalamitous and deplorable. If just, it is the obvious interest of\r\nboth parties, omitting the plea of humanity, that the causes should be\r\nwithout delay inquired into and removed; and if false, it is\r\nequally desirable that effectual measures should be taken to obviate\r\nmisapprehensions. This can only be done by permitting an officer, of\r\nconfidence on both sides, to visit the prisoners in their respective\r\nconfinements, and to examine into their true condition. This will\r\neither at once satisfy you that by some abuse of trust in the persons\r\nimmediately charged with the care of the prisoners, their treatment is\r\nreally such as has been described to us and requires a change; or it\r\nwill convince us that the clamors are ill-grounded. A disposition to\r\naggravate the miseries of captivity is too illiberal to be imputed to\r\nany but those subordinate characters, who, in every service, are too\r\noften remiss and unprincipled. This reflection assures me that you will\r\nacquiesce in the mode proposed for ascertaining the truth and detecting\r\ndelinquency on one side, or falsehood on the other. The discussions and\r\nasperities which have had too much place on the subject of prisoners are\r\nso irksome in themselves, and have had so many ill consequences, that it\r\nis infinitely to be wished that there may be no room given for reviving\r\nthem. The mode I have suggested appears to me calculated to bring\r\nthe present case to a fair, direct, and satisfactory issue. I am not\r\nsensible of any inconvenience it can be attended with, and I therefore\r\nhope for your concurrence.\r\n\r\nI should be glad, as soon as possible, to hear from you on the subject.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, etc., George Washington.\r\n\r\nTo this letter, written in January, Admiral Arbuthnot did not reply\r\nuntil the latter part of April. He then wrote:\r\n\r\nRoyal Oak Office April 2lst. 1781.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nIf I had not been very busy when I received your letter dated the 25 of\r\nJan. last, complaining of the treatment of the naval prisoners at\r\nthis place, I certainly should have answered it before this time; and,\r\nnotwithstanding that I then thought, as I now do, that my own testimony\r\nwould have been sufficient to put the truth past a doubt, I ordered\r\nthe strictest scrutiny to be made into the condition of all parties\r\nconcerned in the victualling and treatment of those unfortunate people.\r\nTheir several testimonies you must have seen, and I give you my\r\nhonor that the transaction was conducted with such strict care and\r\nimpartiality that you may rely on its validity.\r\n\r\nPermit me now, Sir, to request that you will take the proper steps to\r\ncause Mr. Bradford, your Commissary, and the Jailor at Philadelphia,\r\nto abate the inhumanity which they exercise indiscriminately upon all\r\npeople who are so unfortunate as to be carried into that place.\r\n\r\nI will not trouble you, Sir, with a catalogue of grievances, further\r\nthan to request that the unfortunate may feel as little of the\r\nseverities of war as the circumstances of the time will permit, that in\r\nfuture they may not be fed in winter with salted clams, and that they\r\nmay be afforded a sufficiency of fuel.\r\n\r\nI am, Sir, your most obdt and hble srvt M. Arbuthnot.\r\n\r\nProbably the American prisoners would have been glad to eat salted\r\nclams, rather than diseased pork, and, as has been shown, they were\r\nsometimes frozen to death on board the prison ships, where no fire\r\nexcept for cooking purposes seems ever to have been allowed.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1781, a committee appointed by Congress to examine into the\r\ncondition of naval prisoners reported among other things as follows:\r\n“The Committee consisting of Mr. Boudinot, Mr. Sharpe, Mr. Clymer,\r\nappointed to take into consideration the state of the American prisoners\r\nin the power of the enemy report:\r\n\r\n“That they have collected together and cursorily looked into various\r\nevidences of the treatment our unhappy fellow-citizens, prisoners with\r\nthe enemy, have heretofore and do still meet with, and find the\r\nsubject of so important and serious a nature as to demand much greater\r\nattention, and fuller consideration than the present distant situation\r\nof those confined on board the Prison-ships at New York will now admit\r\nof, wherefor they beg leave to make a partial representation, and desire\r\nleave to sit again. * * *”\r\n\r\n\r\nPART OF THE REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE\r\n\r\n“A very large number of marine prisoners and citizens of these\r\nUnited States taken by the enemy, are now closely confined on board\r\nPrison-ships in the harbor of New York.\r\n\r\n“That the said Prison-ships are so unequal in size to the number of\r\nprisoners, as not to admit of a possibility of preserving life in this\r\nwarm season of the year, they being crowded together in such a manner\r\nas to be in danger of suffocation, as well as exposed to every kind of\r\nputrid, pestilential disorder:\r\n\r\n“That no circumstances of the enemy’s particular situation can justify\r\nthis outrage on humanity, it being contrary to the usage and customs of\r\ncivilizations, thus deliberately to murder their captives in cold blood,\r\nas the enemy will not assert that Prison-ships, equal to the number of\r\nprisoners, cannot be obtained so as to afford room sufficient for the\r\nnecessary purposes of life:\r\n\r\n“That the enemy do daily improve these distresses to enlist and compel\r\nmany of our citizens to enter on board their ships of war, and thus to\r\nfight against their fellow citizens, and dearest connections.\r\n\r\n“That the said Marine prisoners, until they can be exchanged should\r\nbe supplied with such necessaries of clothing and provisions as can be\r\nobtained to mitigate their present sufferings.\r\n\r\n“That, therefor, the Commander-in-chief be and he is hereby instructed\r\nto remonstrate to the proper officer within the enemy’s lines, on the\r\nsaid unjustifiable treatment of our Marine prisoners, and demand, in\r\nthe most express terms, to know the reasons of this unnecessary severity\r\ntowards them; and that the Commander-in-chief transmit such answer\r\nas may be received thereon to Congress, that decided measures for\r\ndue retaliation may be adopted, if a redress of these evils be not\r\nimmediately given.\r\n\r\n“That the Commander-in-chief be and he is hereby also instructed to\r\ndirect to supply the said prisoners with such provisions and light\r\nclothing for their present more comfortable subsistence as may be in his\r\npower to obtain, and in such manner as he may judge most advantageous\r\nfor the United States.”\r\n\r\nAccordingly Washington wrote to the officer then commanding at New York,\r\nCommodore Affleck, as follows:\r\n\r\nHeadquarters, August 21 1781\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nThe almost daily complaints of the severities exercised towards the\r\nAmerican marine prisoners in New York have induced the Hon. the Congress\r\nof the United States to direct me to remonstrate to the commanding\r\nofficer of his British Majesty’s ships of war in the harbor upon the\r\nsubject; and to report to them his answer. The principal complaint now\r\nis, the inadequacy of the room in the Prison-ships to the number of\r\nprisoners, confined on board of them, which causes the death of many,\r\nand is the occasion of most intolerable inconvenience and distresses to\r\nthose who survive. This line of conduct is the more aggravating, as\r\nthe want of a greater number of Prison-ships, or of sufficient room on\r\nshore, can hardly be pleaded in excuse.\r\n\r\nAs a bare denial of what has been asserted by so many individuals who\r\nhave unfortunately experienced the miseries I have mentioned, will\r\nnot be satisfactory, I have to propose that our Commissary-general of\r\nprisoners, or any other officer, who shall be agreed upon, shall have\r\nliberty to visit the ships, inspect the situation of the prisoners, and\r\nmake a report, from an exact survey of the situation in which they may\r\nbe found, whether, in his opinion, there has been any just cause of\r\ncomplaint.\r\n\r\nI shall be glad to be favored with an answer as soon as convenient.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be yr most obdt srvt George Washington\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFLECK’S REPLY\r\n\r\nNew York 30 August 1781\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nI intend not either to deny or to assert, for it will neither facilitate\r\nbusiness, nor alleviate distress. The subject of your letter seems to\r\nturn on two points, namely the inconvenience and distresses which\r\nthe American prisoners suffer from the inadequacy of room in the\r\nPrison-ships, which occasions the death of many of them, as you are\r\ntold; and that a Commissary-general of prisoners from you should have\r\nliberty to visit the ships, inspect the situation of the prisoners, and\r\nmake a report from an actual survey. I take leave to assure you that\r\nI feel for the distresses of mankind as much as any man; and since my\r\ncommission to the naval command of the department, one of my principal\r\nendeavors has been to regulate the Prison and hospital ships.\r\n\r\nThe Government having made no other provision for naval prisoners than\r\nshipping, it is impossible that the greater inconvenience which people\r\nconfined on board ships experience beyond those confined on shore can be\r\navoided, and a sudden accumulation of people often aggravates the evil.\r\n\r\nBut I assure you that every attention is shown that is possible, and\r\nthat the Prison-ships are under the very same Regulations here that have\r\nbeen constantly observed towards the prisoners of all nations in Europe.\r\nTables of diet are publicly affixed; officers visit every week, redress\r\nand report grievances, and the numbers are thinned as they can provide\r\nshipping, and no attention has been wanting.\r\n\r\nThe latter point cannot be admitted to its full extent; but if you think\r\nfit to send an officer of character to the lines for that purpose, he\r\nwill be conducted to me, and he shall be accompanied by an officer, and\r\nbecome a witness to the manner in which we treat the prisoners, and I\r\nshall expect to have my officer visit the prisoners detained in your\r\njails and dungeons in like manner, as well as in the mines, where I am\r\ninformed many an unhappy victim languishes out his days. I must remark,\r\nhad Congress ever been inclined, they might have contributed to relieve\r\nthe distress of those whom we are under the necessity of holding as\r\nprisoners, by sending in all in their possession towards the payment\r\nof the large debt they owe us on that head, which might have been an\r\ninducement towards liberating many now in captivity. I have the honor to\r\nbe, Sir, with due respect, etc,\r\n\r\nEdmund Affleck\r\n\r\nMuch correspondence passed between the English and American Commissaries\r\nof Prisoners, as well as between Washington and the commanding officer\r\nat New York on the subject of the naval prisoners, but little good seems\r\nto have been effected thereby until late in the war, when negotiations\r\nfor peace had almost progressed to a finish. We have seen that, in the\r\nsummer of 1782, the hard conditions on board the prison ships were\r\nin some measure mitigated, and that the sick were sent to Blackwell’s\r\nIsland, where they had a chance for life. We might go on presenting much\r\nmore of the correspondence on both sides, and detail all the squabbles\r\nabout the number of prisoners exchanged; their treatment while in\r\nprison; and other subjects of dispute, but the conclusion of the whole\r\nmatter was eloquently written in the sands of the Wallabout, where\r\nthe corpses of thousands of victims to British cruelty lay for so many\r\nyears. We will therefore give only a few further extracts from the\r\ncorrespondence and reports on the subject, as so much of it was tedious\r\nand barren of any good result.\r\n\r\nIn December of the year 1781 Washington, on whom the duty devolved of\r\nwriting so many of the letters, and receiving so many insulting replies,\r\nwrote to the President of Congress as follows:\r\n\r\n“I have taken the liberty of enclosing the copies of two letters from\r\nthe Commissary-general of Prisoners setting forth the debt which is\r\ndue from us on account of naval prisoners; the number remaining in\r\ncaptivity, their miserable situation, and the little probability there\r\nis of procuring their release for the want of proper subjects in our\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n“Before we proceed into an inquiry into the measures that ought to be\r\nadopted to enable us to pay our debt, and to affect the exchange of\r\nthose who still remain in captivity, a matter which it may take some\r\ntime to determine, humanity and policy point out the necessity of\r\nadministering to the pressing wants of a number of the most valuable\r\nsubjects of the republic.\r\n\r\n“Had they been taken in the Continental service, I should have thought\r\nmyself authorized in conjunction with the Minister of War to apply a\r\nremedy, but as the greater part of them were not thus taken, as appears\r\nby Mr. Skinner’s representation, I must await the decision of Congress\r\nupon the subject.\r\n\r\n“Had a system, some time ago planned by Congress and recommended to the\r\nseveral States, been adopted and carried fully into execution, I mean\r\nthat of obliging all Captains of private vessels to deliver over their\r\nprisoners to the Continental Commissioners upon certain conditions, I am\r\npersuaded that the numbers taken and brought into the many ports of the\r\nUnited States would have amounted to a sufficiency to have exchanged\r\nthose taken from us; but instead of that, it is to be feared, that few\r\nin proportion were secured, and that the few who are sent in, are so\r\npartially applied, that it creates great disgust in those remaining.\r\nThe consequence of which is, that conceiving themselves neglected, and\r\nseeing no prospect of relief, many of them entered into the enemy’s\r\nservice, to the very great loss of our trading interest. Congress will,\r\ntherefore, I hope, see the necessity of renewing their former, or making\r\nsome similar recommendation to the States.\r\n\r\n“In addition to the motives above mentioned, for wishing that the\r\nwhole business of prisoners of war might be brought under one general\r\nregulation, there is another of no small consideration, which is, that\r\nit would probably put a stop to those mutual complaints of ill treatment\r\nwhich are frequently urged on each part. For it is a fact that, for\r\nabove two years, we have had no occasion to complain of the treatment of\r\nthe Continental land prisoners in New York, neither have we been charged\r\nwith any improper conduct towards those in our hands. I consider the\r\nsufferings of the seamen, for some time past, as arising in great\r\nmeasure from the want of that general regulation which has been spoken\r\nof, and without which there will constantly be a great number remaining\r\nin the hands of the enemy. * * *”\r\n\r\nAgain in February of the year 1782 Washington wrote to Congress from\r\nPhiladelphia as follows:\r\n\r\nFeb. 18, 1782.\r\n\r\n* * * “Mr. Sproat’s proposition of the exchange of British soldiers for\r\nAmerican seamen, if acceded to, will immediately give the enemy a very\r\nconsiderable re-enforcement, and will be a constant draft hereafter upon\r\nthe prisoners of war in our hands. It ought also to be considered that\r\nfew or none of the Continental naval prisoners in New York or elsewhere\r\nbelong to the Continental service. I, however, feel for the situation\r\nof these unfortunate people, and wish to see them relieved by any mode,\r\nwhich will not materially affect the public good. In some former letters\r\nupon this subject I have mentioned a plan, by which I am certain\r\nthey might be liberated nearly as fast as they are captured. It is by\r\nobliging the Captains of all armed vessels, both public and private,\r\nto throw their prisoners into common stock, under the direction of the\r\nCommissary-general of prisoners. By this means they would be taken care\r\nof, and regularly applied to the exchange of those in the hands of the\r\nenemy. Now the greater part are dissipated, and the few that remain are\r\napplied partially. * * *”\r\n\r\nJames Rivington edited a paper in New York during the Revolution, and,\r\nin 1782, the American prisoners on board the Jersey addressed a letter\r\nto him for publication, which is given below.\r\n\r\n“On Board the Prison-ship Jersey, June 11, 1782.\r\n\r\n“Sir:\r\n\r\nEnclosed are five letters, which if you will give a place in your\r\nnewspaper will greatly oblige a number of poor prisoners who seem to be\r\ndeserted by our own countrymen, who has it in their power, and will not\r\nexchange us.

SPROAT\r\n\r\nDavid Sproat to Abraham Skinner, American Commissary of Prisoners.\r\n\r\nNew York lst June 1782\r\n\r\n“Sir:\r\n\r\n“When I last saw you at Elizabeth Town I mentioned the bad consequences\r\nwhich, in all probability, would take place in the hot weather if an\r\nexchange of prisoners was not agreed to by the commissioners on the part\r\nof General Washington. His Excellency Rear-Admiral Digby has ordered me\r\nto inform you, that the very great increase of prisoners and heat of\r\nthe weather now baffles all our care and attention to keep them healthy.\r\nFive ships have been taken up for their reception, to prevent being\r\ncrowded, and a great number permitted to go on parole.\r\n\r\n“In Winter, and during the cold weather, they lived comfortably, being\r\nfully supplied with warm cloathing, blankets, etc, purchased with the\r\nmoney which I collected from the charitable people of this city; but now\r\nthe weather requires a fresh supply--something light and suitable\r\nfor the season--for which you will be pleased to make the necessary\r\nprovision, as it is impossible for them to be healthy in the rags they\r\nnow wear, without a single shift of cloathing to keep themselves clean.\r\nHumanity, sympathy, my duty and orders obliges me to trouble you again\r\non this disagreeable subject, to request you will lose no time in laying\r\ntheir situation before his Excellency General Washington, who, I hope,\r\nwill listen to the cries of a distressed people, and grant them, (as\r\nwell as the British prisoners in his hands) relief, by consenting to a\r\ngeneral and immediate exchange.\r\n\r\n“I am, sir, etc, “David Sproat.”\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to point out to the intelligent reader the\r\ninconsistencies in this letter. The comfortable prisoners, abundantly\r\nsupplied with blankets and clothing in the winter by the charity of the\r\ncitizens of New York, were so inconsiderate as to go on starving\r\nand freezing to death throughout that season. Not only so, but\r\ntheir abundant supply of clothing was reduced to tattered rags in a\r\nsurprisingly short time, and they were unable to be healthy, “without a\r\nsingle shift of clothing to keep themselves clean.”\r\n\r\nWe have already seen to what straits they were in reality reduced, in\r\nspite of the private charity of the citizens of New York. We do not\r\ndoubt that the few blankets and other new clothing, if any such were\r\never sent on board the Jersey, were the gifts of private charity, and\r\nnot the donation of the British Government.\r\n\r\nNo one, we believe, can blame General Washington for his unwillingness\r\nto add to the British forces arrayed against his country by exchanging\r\nthe captured troops in the hands of the Americans for the crews of\r\nAmerican privateers, who were not in the Continental service. As we have\r\nalready seen, the blame does not rest with that great commander, whose\r\ncompassion never blinded his judgment, but with the captains and owners\r\nof American privateers themselves, and often with the towns of New\r\nEngland, who were unwilling to burden themselves with prisoners taken on\r\nthe ocean.\r\n\r\nThe next letter we will quote is the answer of Commissary Skinner to\r\nDavid Sproat:\r\n\r\n“New York June 9th. 1782\r\n\r\n“Sir:\r\n\r\nFrom the present situation of the American naval prisoners on board your\r\nprison-ships, I am induced to propose to you the exchange of as many as\r\nI can give you British naval prisoners for, leaving the balance\r\nalready due you to be paid when in our power. I could wish this to be\r\nrepresented to his Excellency, Rear Admiral Digby, and that the proposal\r\ncould be acceded to, as it would relieve many of these distrest men and\r\nbe consistent with the humane purposes of our office.\r\n\r\n“I will admit that we are unable at present to give you seaman for\r\nseaman, and thereby relieve the prison-ships of their dreadful burthen,\r\nbut it ought to be remembered there is a large balance of British\r\nsoldiers due to the United States, since February last, and that as we\r\nhave it in our power we may be disposed to place the British soldiers\r\nwho are now in our possession in as disagreeable a situation as those\r\nmen are on board the prison ships.\r\n\r\n“I am yr obdt hble srvt “Abraham Skinner”\r\n\r\nCOMMISSARY SPROAT’S REPLY\r\n\r\n“New York June 9th 1782\r\n\r\n“Sir:\r\n\r\n“I have received your letter of this date and laid it before his\r\nExcellency Rear Admiral Digby, Commander in charge, etc, who has\r\ndirected me to give for answer that the balance of prisoners, owing to\r\nthe British having proceeded, from lenity and humanity, on the part of\r\nhimself and those who commanded before his arrival, is surprized you\r\nhave not been induced to offer to exchange them first; and until this is\r\ndone can’t consent to your proposal of a partial exchange, leaving the\r\nremainder as well as the British prisoners in your hands, to linger in\r\nconfinement.

Nine Coopers are included in the list, given\r\nin the appendix to this volume, of prisoners on the Jersey, but no John\r\nCooper is among them. The list is exceedingly imperfect. Of the other\r\nsigners of the address only two, George Wanton and John Sheffield, can\r\nbe found within its pages. It is very certain that it is incomplete, and\r\nit probably does not contain more than half the names of the prisoners\r\nwho suffered on board that dreadful place. David Sproat won the hatred\r\nand contempt of all the American prisoners who had anything to do with\r\nhim. One of his most dastardly acts was the paper which he drew up in\r\nJune, 1782, and submitted to a number of American sea captains for their\r\nsignature, which he obtained from them by threats of taking away their\r\nparole in case of their refusal, and sending them back to a captivity\r\nworse than death.

That they inspected their beef, pork, flour, bread,\r\noatmeal, pease, butter, liquors, and indeed every species of provisions\r\nwhich is issued on board his British Majesty’s ships of war, and\r\nfound them all good of their kind, which survey being made before the\r\nprisoners, they acknowledged the same and declared they had no complaint\r\nto make but the want of cloaths and a speedy exchange.

The _Independent Chronicle_, in its issue for\r\nAugust, 1782, had the following refutation: [Footnote: This letter is\r\nsaid to have been written by Captain Manly, _five times_ a prisoner\r\nduring the Revolution.]\r\n\r\n“Mr Printer:\r\n\r\n“Happening to be at Mr. Bracket’s tavern last Saturday, and hearing\r\ntwo gentlemen conversing on the surprising alteration in regard to the\r\ntreatment our prisoners met with in New York, and as I have had the\r\nmisfortune to be more than once a prisoner in England, and in different\r\nprison-ships in New York, and having suffered everything but death, I\r\ncannot help giving all attention to anything I hear or read relative to\r\nthe treatment our brave countrymen met with on board the prison-ships\r\nof New York. One of the gentlemen observed that the treatment of our\r\nprisoners must certainly be much better, as so many of our commanders\r\nhad signed a paper that was wrote by Mr. David Sproat, the commissary of\r\nnaval prisoners in New York. The other gentleman answered and told him\r\nhe could satisfy him in regard to the matter, having seen and conversed\r\nwith several of the Captains that signed Mr. Sproat’s paper, who told\r\nhim that, although they had put their names to the paper that Mr. Sproat\r\nsent them on Long Island, where they were upon parole, yet it was upon\r\nthese conditions they did it: in order to have leave to go home to their\r\nwives and families, and not be sent on board the prison-ships, as Mr.\r\nSproat had threatened to do if they refused to sign the paper that he\r\nsent them. These captains further said, that they did not read the paper\r\nnor hear it read. The gentleman then asked them how they could sign\r\ntheir names to a paper they did not read; they said it was because\r\nthey might go home upon parole. He asked one of them why he did not\r\ncontradict it since it had appeared in the public papers, and was false:\r\nhe said he dare not at present, for fear of being recalled and sent on\r\nboard the prison-ship, and there end his days: but as soon as he was\r\nexchanged he would do it. If this gentleman, through fear, dare not\r\ncontradict such a piece of falsehood, I dare, and if I was again\r\nconfined on board the prison-ship in New York, dare again take the boat\r\nand make my escape, although at the risk of my life.\r\n\r\n“Some of the captains went on board the prison-ship with Mr. Sproat, a\r\nfew moments, but did not go off the deck.\r\n\r\n“In justice to myself and country I am obliged to publish the above.\r\n\r\n“Captain Rover.”\r\n\r\nBesides this refutation of Sproat’s shameful trick there were many\r\nothers. The _Pennsylvania Packet_ of Tuesday, Sept. 10, 1782, published\r\nan affidavit of John Kitts, a former prisoner on board the Jersey.\r\n\r\n“The voluntary affidavit of John Kitts, of the city of Phila., late\r\nmate of the sloop Industry, commanded by Robert Harris, taken before the\r\nsubscriber, chief justice of the commonwealth of Pa., the 16th day of\r\nJuly, 1782.--This deponent saith, that in the month of November last\r\nhe was walking in Front St. with the said Harris and saw in his hand a\r\npaper, which he told the deponent that he had received from a certain\r\nCaptain Kuhn, who had been lately from New York, where he had been\r\na prisoner, and that this deponent understood and believed it was a\r\npermission or pass to go to New York with any vessel, as it was blank\r\nand subscribed by Admiral Arbuthnot: that he does not know that the said\r\nRobert Harris ever made any improper use of said paper.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIDAVIT OF JOHN COCHRAN, DENYING THE TRUTH OF THE STATEMENTS CONTAINED\r\nIN THE REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF CAPTAINS\r\n\r\nFrom the _Pennsylvania Packet_, Phila., Tuesday, Sept. 10, 1782.\r\n\r\n“The voluntary Affidavit of John Cochran, of the city of Phila.,\r\nlate mate of the ship, Admiral Youtman, of Phila., taken before the\r\nsubscriber, the 16 day of July, 1782.\r\n\r\n“The said deponent saith, that he was taken prisoner on board the\r\naforesaid ship on the 12 of March last by the ship Garland, belonging to\r\nthe king of Great Britain, and carried into the city of New York, on\r\nthe 15 of the same month, when he was immediately put on board the\r\nprison-ship Jersey, with the whole crew of the Admiral Youtman, and was\r\nclose confined there until the first day of this month, when he made his\r\nescape; that the people on board the said prison-ship were very\r\nsickly insomuch that he is firmly persuaded, out of near 1000 persons,\r\nperfectly healthy when put on board the same ship, during the time of\r\nhis confinement on board, there are not more than but three or four\r\nhundred now alive; that when he made his escape there were not three\r\nhundred men well on board, but upward of 140 very sick, as he understood\r\nand was informed by the physicians: that there were five or six men\r\nburied daily under a bank on the shore, without coffins; that all the\r\nlarboard side of the said ship was made use of as a hospital for the\r\nsick, and was so offensive that he was obliged constantly to hold\r\nhis nose as he passed from the gun-room up the hatchway; that he seen\r\nmaggots creeping out of a wound of one Sullivan’s shoulder, who was the\r\nmate of a vessel out of Virginia; and that his wound remained undressed\r\nfor several days together; that every man was put into the hold a little\r\nafter sundown every night, and the hatches put over him; and that the\r\ntubs which were kept for the use of the sick * * * were placed under the\r\nladder from the hatchway to the hold, and so offensive day and night,\r\nthat they were almost intolerable, and increased the number of the\r\nsick daily. The deponent further saith, that the bilge water was very\r\ninjurious in the hold, was muddy and dirty, and never was changed or\r\nsweetened during the whole time he was there, nor, as he was informed\r\nand believes to be true, for many years before; for fear, as it was\r\nreported, the provisions might be injured thereby; that the sick in the\r\nhospital part of the said ship Jersey, had no sheets of Russia, or any\r\nother linen, nor beds nor bedding furnished them; and those who had\r\nno beds of their own, of whom there were great numbers, were not even\r\nallowed a hammock, but were obliged to lie on the planks; that he was on\r\nboard the said prison ship when Captain Robert Harris and others, with\r\nDavid Sproat, the commissary of prisoners, came on board her, and that\r\nnone of them went or attempted to go below decks, in said ship, to\r\nsee the situation of the prisoners, nor did they ask a single question\r\nrespecting the matter, to this deponent’s knowledge or belief; for\r\nthat he was present the whole time they were on board, and further the\r\ndeponent saith not.\r\n\r\n“John Cochran”\r\n\r\n“Theodore McKean C.

As I have no agency on Naval matters, this application to me is\r\nmade on mistaken grounds. But curiosity leading me to enquire into\r\nthe nature and cause of their sufferings, I am informed that the prime\r\ncomplaint is that of their being crowded, especially at this season, in\r\ngreat numbers on board of foul and infected prison ships, where disease\r\nand death are almost inevitable. This circumstance I am persuaded needs\r\nonly to be mentioned to your Excellency to obtain that redress which is\r\nin your power _only_ to afford, and which humanity so strongly prompts.\r\n\r\nIf the fortune of war, Sir, has thrown a number of these miserable\r\npeople into your hands, I am certain your Excellency’s feelings for\r\nfellowmen must induce you to proportion the ships (if they _must_ be\r\nconfined on board ships), to their accommodation and comfort, and not,\r\nby crowding them together in a few, bring on disorders which consign\r\nthem, by half a dozen a day, to the grave.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers of his British Majesty, prisoners with us, were they (which\r\nmight be the case), to be equally crowded together in close and confined\r\nprisons, at this season, would be exposed to equal loss and misery.

Digby\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM COMMISSARY SKINNER TO COMMISSARY SPROAT\r\n\r\nCamp Highlands, June 24th 1782\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nAs I perceive by a New York paper of the 12 inst, the last letters which\r\npassed between us on the subject of naval prisoners have been committed\r\nto print, I must request the same to be done with this which is intended\r\nto contain some animadversions on those publications.\r\n\r\nThe principles and policy which appear to actuate your superiors in\r\ntheir conduct towards the American seamen who unfortunately fall into\r\ntheir power, are too apparent to admit of a doubt or misapprehension.\r\nI am sorry to observe, Sir, that notwithstanding the affectation of\r\ncandour and fairness on your part, from the universal tenor of behaviour\r\non your side of the lines, it is obvious that the designs of the British\r\nis, by misrepresenting the state of facts with regard to exchanges, to\r\nexcite jealousy in the minds of our unfortunate seamen, that they are\r\nneglected by their countrymen, and by attempting to make them believe\r\nthat all the miseries they are now suffering in consequence of a\r\npestilential sickness arise from want of inclination in General\r\nWashington to exchange them when he has it in his power to do it; in\r\nhopes of being able by this insinuation and by the unrelenting\r\nseverity you make use of in confining them in the contaminated holds of\r\nprison-ships, to compel them, in order to avoid the dreadful alternative\r\nof almost inevitable death, to enter the service of the King of Great\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\nTo show that these observations are just and well grounded, I think\r\nit necessary to inform you of some facts which have happened within\r\nmy immediate notice, and to put you in mind of others which you cannot\r\ndeny. I was myself present at the time when Captain Aborn and Dr. Bowen\r\n* * * waited on his Excellency General Washington, and know perfectly\r\nwell the answer his Excellency gave to that application: he informed\r\nthem in the first place that he was not directly or indirectly invested\r\nwith any power of inference respecting the exchange of naval prisoners;\r\nthat this business was formerly under the direction of the Board\r\nof Admiralty, that upon the annihilation of that Board Congress\r\nhad committed it to the Financier (who has in charge all our naval\r\nprisoners) and he to the Secretary at war. That (the General) was\r\nnotwithstanding disposed to do everything in his power for their\r\nassistance and relief: that as exchanging seamen for soldiers was\r\ncontrary to the original agreement for the exchange of prisoners,--which\r\nspecified that officers should be exchanged for officers, soldiers\r\nfor soldiers, citizens for citizens, and seamen for seamen; as it was\r\ncontrary to the custom and practice of other nations, and as it would\r\nbe, in his opinion, contrary to the soundest policy, by giving the\r\nenemy a great and permanent strength for which we could receive no\r\ncompensation, or at best but a partial and temporary one, he did not\r\nthink it would be admissible: but as it appeared to him, from a variety\r\nof well authenticated information, the present misery and mortality\r\nwhich prevailed among the naval prisoners were almost entirely, if not\r\naltogether produced by the _mode of their confinement_, being closely\r\ncrowded together in infected prison-ships, where the very air is\r\npregnant with disease, and the ships themselves (never having been\r\ncleaned in the course of many years), a mere mass of putrefaction, he\r\nwould therefor, from motives of humanity, write to Rear-Admiral Digby,\r\nin whose power it was to remedy this great evil, by confining them on\r\nshore, or having a sufficient number of prison-ships provided for that\r\npurpose, for, he observed, it was as preposterously cruel to confine 800\r\nmen, at this sultry season, on board the Jersey prison-ship, as it would\r\nbe to shut up the whole army of Lord Cornwallis to perish in the New\r\nGoal of Philadelphia, but if more commodious and healthy accommodations\r\nwere not afforded we had the means of retaliation in our hands, which he\r\nshould not hesitate, in that case, to make use of, by confining the land\r\nprisoners with as much severity as our seamen were held.--The Gentlemen\r\nof the Committee appeared to be sensible of the force of these reasons,\r\nhowever repugnant they might be to the feelings and wishes of the men\r\nwho had destruction and death staring them in the face.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency was further pleased to suffer me to go to New York to\r\nexamine into the grounds of the suffering of the prisoners, and to\r\ndevise, if possible, some way or another, for their liberation or\r\nrelief. With this permission I went into your lines: and in consequence\r\nof the authority I had been previously invested with, from the Secretary\r\nat War, I made the proposition contained in my letter of the ninth\r\ninstant. Although I could not claim this as a matter of right I\r\nflattered myself it would have been granted from the principles of\r\nhumanity, as well as other motives. There had been a balance of 495\r\nland prisoners due to us ever since the month of February last, when a\r\nsettlement was made; besides which, to the best of my belief, 400 have\r\nbeen sent in, (this is the true state of the fact, though it differs\r\nwidely from the account of 250 men, which is falsely stated in the\r\nnote annexed to my letter in the New York paper:) notwithstanding this\r\nbalance, I was then about sending into your lines a number of land\r\nprisoners, as an equivalent for ours, who were then confined in the\r\nSugar House, without which (though the debt was acknowledged, I could\r\nnot make interest to have them liberated), this business has since been\r\nactually negotiated, and we glory in having our conduct, such as will\r\nbear the strictest scrutiny, and be found consonant to the dictates of\r\nreason, liberality, and justice. But, Sir, since you would not agree to\r\nthe proposals I made, since I was refused being permitted to visit the\r\nprison-ships: (for which I conclude no other reason can be produced than\r\nyour being ashamed or afraid of having those graves of our seamen seen\r\nby one who dared to represent the horrors of them to his countrymen,)\r\nSince the commissioners from your side, at their late meeting, would not\r\nenter into an adjustment of the accounts for supplying your naval and\r\nland prisoners, on which there are large sums due us; and since your\r\nsuperiors will neither make provision for the support of your prisoners\r\nin our hands, nor accommodation for the mere existence of ours, who are\r\nnow languishing in your prison-ships, it becomes my duty, Sir, to state\r\nthese pointed facts to you, that the imputations may recoil where they\r\nare deserved, and to report to those, under whose authority I have the\r\nhonor to act, that such measures as they deem proper may be adopted.\r\n\r\nAnd now, Sir, I will conclude this long letter with observing that not\r\nhaving a sufficient number of British seamen in our possession we are\r\nnot able to release urs by exchange:--this is our misfortune, but it is\r\nnot a crime, and ought not to operate as a mortal punishment against the\r\nunfortunate--we ask no favour, we claim nothing but common justice and\r\nhumanity, while we assert to the whole world, as a notorious fact,\r\nthat the unprecedented inhumanity in the _mode_ of confining our naval\r\nprisoners, to the amount of 800 in one old hulk, which has been made use\r\nof as a prison-ship for more than three years, without ever having\r\nbeen once purified, has been the real and sole cause of the deaths\r\nof hundreds of brave Americans, who would not have perished in that\r\nuntimely and barbarous manner, had they, (when prisoners,) been suffered\r\nto breathe a purer air, and to enjoy more liberal and convenient\r\naccommodations agreeably to the practice of civilized nations when at\r\nwar, (and) the example which has always been set you by the Americans.\r\nYou may say, and I shall admit, that if they were placed on islands,\r\nand more liberty given them, that some might desert; but is not this the\r\ncase with your prisoners in our hands? And could we not avoid this also,\r\nif we were to adopt the same rigid and inhuman mode of confinement you\r\ndo?\r\n\r\nI beg, Sir, you will be pleased to consider this as addressed to you\r\nofficially, as the principal executive officer in the department of\r\nnaval prisoners, and not personally, and that you will attribute any\r\nuncommon warmth of style that I may have been led into to my feeling and\r\nanimation on a subject with which I find myself so much interested, both\r\nfrom the principles of humanity and the duties of office. I am, Sir,\r\n\r\nyr most obdt Srvt Abraham Skinner\r\n\r\nLetters full of recriminations continued to pass between the\r\ncommissaries on both sides. In Sproat’s reply to the letter we have\r\njust quoted, he enclosed a copy of the paper which he had induced the\r\nthirteen sea captains and other officers to sign, obtained as we have\r\nseen, in such a dastardly manner.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the naval prisoners continued to die in great numbers\r\non board the prison and hospital-ships. We have already described the\r\ncleansing of the Jersey, on which occasion the prisoners were sent on\r\nboard of other vessels and exposed to cold and damp in addition to their\r\nother sufferings. And while negotiations for peace were pending some\r\nrelaxation in severity appears to have taken place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI\r\n\r\nSOME OF THE PRISONERS ON BOARD THE JERSEY\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the crew of the Chance was exchanged in the fall of\r\n1782. A few of the men who composed this crew were ill at the time that\r\nthe exchange was affected, and had been sent to Blackwell’s Island.\r\nAmong these unfortunate sufferers was the sailing-master of the Chance,\r\nwhose name was Sylvester Rhodes.\r\n\r\nThis gentleman was born at Warwick, R. I., November 21, 1745. He married\r\nMary Aborn, youngest sister of Captain Daniel Aborn, and entered the\r\nservice of his country, in the early part of the war, sometimes on land,\r\nand sometimes as a seaman. He was with Commodore Whipple on his first\r\ncruise, and as prize-master carried into Boston the first prize captured\r\nby that officer. He also served in a Rhode Island regiment.\r\n\r\nWhen the crew of the Jersey was exchanged and he was not among the\r\nnumber, his brother-in-law, Captain Aborn, endeavored to obtain his\r\nrelease, but, as he had been an officer in the army as well as on the\r\nprivateer, the British refused to release him as a seaman. His father,\r\nhowever, through the influence of some prominent Tories with whom he\r\nwas connected, finally secured his parole, and Captain Aborn went to\r\nNew York to bring him home. But it was too late. He had become greatly\r\nenfeebled by disease, and died on board the cartel, while on her passage\r\nthrough the Sound, on the 3rd of November, 1782, leaving a widow and\r\nfive children. Mary Aborn Rhodes lived to be 98, dying in 1852, one of\r\nthe last survivors of the stirring times of the Revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM DROWNE\r\n\r\nOne of the most adventurous of American seamen was William Drowne, who\r\nwas taken prisoner more than once. He was born in Providence, R. I., in\r\nApril 1755. After many adventures he sailed on the 18th of May, 1780,\r\nin the General Washington, owned by Mr. John Brown of Providence. In a\r\nJournal kept by Mr. Drowne on board of this ship, he writes:\r\n\r\n“The cruise is for two months and a half, though should New York fetch\r\nus up again, the time may be protracted, but it is not in the bargain to\r\npay that potent city a visit _this bout_. It may easily be imagined what\r\na _sensible mortification_ it must be to dispense with the delicious\r\nsweets of a Prison-ship. But though the Washington is deemed a prime\r\nsailor, and is well armed, I will not be too sanguine in the prospect of\r\nescape, as ‘the race is not always to the swift, nor the battle to the\r\nstrong.’ But, as I said before, it is not in the articles to go there\r\nthis time, especially as it is said the prisoners are very much crowded\r\nthere already, and it would be a piece of unfeeling inhumanity to be\r\nadding to their unavoidable inconvenience by our presence. Nor could we,\r\nin such a case, by any means expect that Madam Fortune would deign to\r\nsmile so propitiously as she did before, in the promotion of an exchange\r\nso much sooner than our most sanguine expectations flattered us with, as\r\n‘tis said to be with no small difficulty that a parole can be obtained,\r\nmuch more an exchange.”\r\n\r\nThis cruise resulted in the capture by the Washington of several\r\nvessels, among them the Robust, Lord Sandwich, Barrington, and the\r\nSpitfire, a British privateer.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1781, Mr. Drowne sailed on board the Belisarius, commanded by\r\nCaptain James Munro, which vessel was captured on the 26th of July and\r\nbrought into the port of New York. Browne and the other officers were\r\nsent to the Jersey, where close confinement and all the horrors of the\r\nplace soon impaired his vigorous constitution. Although he was, through\r\nthe influence of his friends, allowed to visit Newport on parole in\r\nNovember, 1781, he was returned to the prison ship, and was not released\r\nuntil some time in 1783. His brother, who was a physician, nursed him\r\nfaithfully, but he died on the 9th of August, 1786. Letters written on\r\nboard the Jersey have a melancholy interest to the student of history,\r\nand this one, written by William Drowne to a Mrs. Johnston, of New York,\r\nis taken from the appendix to the “Recollections of Captain Dring.”\r\n\r\nJersey Prison Ship Sep. 25 1781\r\n\r\nMadam:\r\n\r\nYour letter to Captain Joshua Sawyer of the 23d Inst, came on board this\r\nmoment, which I being requested to answer, take the freedom to do, and\r\nwith sensible regret, as it announces the dissolution of the good man.\r\nIt was an event very unexpected. Tis true he had been for some days very\r\nill, but a turn in his favor cancel’d all further apprehension of his\r\nbeing dangerous, and but yesterday he was able without assistance to go\r\nupon deck; said he felt much better, and without any further Complaints,\r\nat the usual time turned into his Hammock, and as was supposed went\r\nto sleep. Judge of our Surprise and Astonishment this morning at being\r\ninformed of his being found a lifeless Corpse.\r\n\r\nCould anything nourishing or comfortable have been procured for him\r\nduring his illness, ‘tis possible He might now have been a well man. But\r\nHeaven thought proper to take him to itself, and we must not repine.\r\n\r\nA Coffin would have been procured in case it could be done seasonably,\r\nbut his situation render’d a speedy Interment unavoidable. Agreeably to\r\nwhich 10 or 12 Gentlemen of his acquaintance presented a petition to\r\nthe Commanding Officer on board, requesting the favor that they might be\r\npermitted, under the Inspection of a file of Soldiers, to pay the last\r\nsad duties to a Gentleman of merit; which he humanely granted, and in\r\nthe Afternoon his remains were taken on shore, and committed to their\r\nnative dust in as decent a manner as our situation would admit. Myself,\r\nin room of a better, officiated in the sacred office of a Chaplain and\r\nread prayers over the Corpse previous to its final close in its gloomy\r\nmansion. I have given you these particulars, Madam, as I was sensible it\r\nmust give you great satisfaction to hear he had some friends on board.\r\nYour benevolent and good intentions to him shall, (if Heaven permits\r\nmy return) be safely delivered to his afflicted wife, to give her\r\nthe sensible Consolation that her late much esteemed and affectionate\r\nHusband was not destitute of a Friend, who had wish’d to do him all the\r\ngood offices in his power, had not the hand of fate prevented.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to know anything relative to myself--if you will give\r\nYourself the trouble to call on Mrs. James Selhrig, she will inform You,\r\nor Jos. Aplin, Esqre.\r\n\r\nYou will please to excuse the Liberty I have taken being an entire\r\nstranger. I have no Views in it but those of giving, as I said before,\r\nsatisfaction to one who took a friendly part towards a Gentleman\r\ndecease’d, whom I very much esteemed. Your goodness will not look with a\r\ncritical eye over the numerous Imperfections of this Epistle.\r\n\r\nI am, Madam, with every sentiment of respect\r\n\r\nyr most Obdt Servt\r\n\r\nWm. Drowne\r\n\r\nThe next letter we will give was written by Dr. Solomon Drowne to his\r\nsister Sally. This gentleman was making every effort to obtain his\r\nbrother’s release from captivity.\r\n\r\nProvidence, Oct. 17 1781\r\n\r\nDear Sally:\r\n\r\nWe have not forgot you;--but if we think strongly on other objects the\r\nmemory of you returns, more grateful than the airs which fan the Summer,\r\nor all the golden products of ye Autumn. The Cartel is still detained,\r\nfor what reason is not fully known. Perhaps they meditate an attack upon\r\nsome unguarded, unsuspecting quarter, and already in idea glut their\r\neyes, with the smoke of burning Towns and Villages, and are soothed by\r\nthe sounds of deep distress. Forbid it Guardian of America!--and rather\r\nlet the reason be their fear that we should know the state of their\r\nshattered Navy and declining affairs--However, Bill is yet a Prisoner,\r\nand still must feel, if not for himself, yet what a mind like his will\r\never feel for others. In a letter I received from him about three weeks\r\nsince he mentioned that having a letter to Mr. George Deblois, he sent\r\nit, accompanied with one he wrote requesting his influence towards\r\neffecting his return the next Flag,--that Mr. Deblois being indisposed,\r\nhis cousin Captain William Deblois, taken by Monro last year, came on\r\nboard to see him, with a present from Mr. Deblois of some Tea, Sugar,\r\nWine, Rum, etc, and the offer of any other Civilities that lay in the\r\npower of either:--This was beneficence and true Urbanity,--that he was\r\nnot destitute of Cash, that best friend in Adversity, except some other\r\nbest friends,--that as long as he had health, he should, he had like to\r\nhave said, be happy. In a word he bears up with his wonted fortitude and\r\ngood spirits, as we say, nor discovers the least repining at his fate.\r\nBut you and I who sleep on beds of down and inhale the untainted,\r\ncherishing air, surrounded by most endeared connexions, know that his\r\ncannot be the most delectable of situations: therefor with impatience we\r\nlook for his happy return to the Circle of his Friends.\r\n\r\nYr aff Bro.\r\n\r\nSolomon Drowne\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. S. DROWNE TO MRS. MARCY DROWNE\r\n\r\nNewport Nov. 14 1781\r\n\r\nRespected Mother,\r\n\r\nI found Billy much better than I expected, the account we received of\r\nhis situation having been considerably exaggerated: However we ought to\r\nbe thankful we were not deceived by a too favorable account, and so left\r\nhim to the care of strangers, when he might most need the soothing aid\r\nof close relatives. He is very weak yet, and as a second relapse might\r\nendanger his reduced, tottering system, think it advisable not to set\r\noff for home with him till the wind is favorable. He is impatient, for\r\nthe moment of its shifting, as he is anxious to see you all.\r\n\r\nThe boat is just going, Adieu, yr aff son\r\n\r\nSolomon Drowne\r\n\r\nWe have already quoted from the Recollections of Jeremiah Johnson who\r\nlived on the banks of Wallabout Bay during the Revolution. He further\r\nsays: “The prisoners confined in the Jersey had secretly obtained a\r\ncrow-bar which was kept concealed in the berth of some confidential\r\nofficer among the prisoners. The bar was used to break off the _port_\r\ngratings. This was done, in windy nights, when good swimmers were ready\r\nto leave the ship for the land. In this way a number escaped.\r\n\r\n“Captain Doughty, a friend of the writer, had charge of the bar when he\r\nwas a prisoner on board of the Jersey, and effected his escape by its\r\nmeans. When he left the ship he gave the bar to a confidant to be used\r\nfor the relief of others. Very few who left the ship were retaken. They\r\nknew where to find friends to conceal them, and to help them beyond\r\npursuit.\r\n\r\n“A singularly daring and successful escape was effected from the Jersey\r\nabout 4 o’clock one afternoon in the beginning of Dec. 1780. The best\r\nboat of the ship had returned from New York between 3 & 4 o’clock, and\r\nwas left fast at the gangway, with the oars on board. The afternoon was\r\nstormy, the wind blew from the north-east, and the tide ran flood.\r\nA watchword was given, and a number of prisoners placed themselves\r\ncarelessly between the ship’s waist and the sentinel. At this juncture\r\nfour Eastern Captains got on board the boat, which was cast off by their\r\nfriends. The boat passed close under the bows of the ship, and was a\r\nconsiderable distance from her before the sentinel in the fo’castle gave\r\nthe alarm, and fired at her. The second boat was manned for a chase; she\r\npursued in vain; one man from her bow fired several shots at the boat,\r\nand a few guns were fired at her from the Bushwick shore; but all to no\r\neffect,--and the boat passed Hell-gate in the evening, and arrived safe\r\nin Connecticut next morning.\r\n\r\n“A spring of the writer was a favorite watering-place for the British\r\nshipping. The water-boat of the Jersey watered from this spring daily\r\nwhen it could be done; four prisoners were generally brought on shore\r\nto fill the casks, attended by a guard. The prisoners were frequently\r\npermitted to come to the (Johnstons’) house to get milk and food; and\r\noften brought letters privately from the prisoners. From these the\r\nsufferings on board were revealed.\r\n\r\n“Supplies of vegetables were frequently collected by Mr. Remsen (the\r\nbenevolent owner of the mill,) for the prisoners; and small sums of\r\nmoney were sent on board by the writer’s father to his friends by means\r\nof these watering parties.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ESCAPE FROM THE JERSEY\r\n\r\n“I was one of 850 souls confined in the Jersey in the summer of 1781,\r\nand witnessed several daring attempts to escape. They generally ended\r\ntragically. They were always undertaken in the night, after wrenching or\r\nfiling the bar off the port-holes. Having been on board several weeks,\r\nand goaded to death in various ways, four of us concluded to run the\r\nhazard. We set to work and got the bars off, and waited impatiently for\r\na dark night. We lay in front of Mr. Remsen’s door, inside of the\r\npier head and not more that 20 yards distant. There were several guard\r\nsloops, one on our bow, and the other off our quarter a short distance\r\nfrom us. The dark night came, the first two were lowered quietly into\r\nthe water; and the third made some rumbling. I was the fourth that\r\ndescended, but had not struck off from the vessel before the guards\r\nwere alarmed, and fired upon us. The alarm became general, and I was\r\nimmediately hauled on board (by the other prisoners).\r\n\r\n“They manned their boats, and with their lights and implements of death\r\nwere quick in pursuit of the unfortunates, cursing and swearing, and\r\nbellowing and firing. It was awful to witness this deed of blood. It\r\nlasted about an hour,--all on board trembling for our shipmates. These\r\ndesperadoes returned to their different vessels rejoicing that they had\r\nkilled three damned rebels.\r\n\r\n“About three years after this I saw a gentleman in John St., near\r\nNassau, who accosted me thus: ‘Manley, how do you do?’ I could not\r\nrecollect him. ‘Is it possible you don’t know me? Recollect the Old\r\nJersey?’ And he opened his vest and bared his breast. I immediately said\r\nto him--‘You are James McClain.’ ‘I am,’ said he. We both stepped into\r\nMariner’s public house, at the corner, and he related his marvellous\r\nescape to me.\r\n\r\n“‘They pursued me:--I frequently dived to avoid them, and when I came up\r\nthey fired on me. I caught my breath, and immediately dived again, and\r\nheld my breath till I crawled along the mud. They no doubt thought they\r\nkilled me. I however, with much exertion, though weak and wounded, made\r\nout to reach the shore, and got into a barn, not far from the ship, a\r\nlittle north of Mr. Remsen’s house. The farmer, the next morning, came\r\ninto his barn,--saw me lying on the floor, and ran out in a fright. I\r\nbegged him to come to me, and he did, I gave an account of myself, where\r\nI was from, how I was pursued, with several others. He saw my wounds,\r\ntook pity on me; sent for his wife, and bound up my wounds, and kept\r\nme in the barn until night-fall,--took me into his house, nursed me\r\nsecretly, and then furnished me with clothing, etc., and when I was\r\nrestored, he took me with him, into his market-boat to this city, and\r\nwent with me to the west part of the city, provided me with a passage\r\nover to Bergen, and I landed somewhere in Communipaw. Some friends\r\nhelped me across Newark Bay, and then I worked my way, until I\r\nreached Baltimore, to the great joy of all my friends.” [Footnote:\r\n“Recollections of Captain Manley”.]\r\n\r\nJust what proportion of captives died on board of the Jersey it is now\r\nimpossible to determine. No doubt there were many escapes of which it\r\nis impossible to obtain the particulars. The winter of 1779-80 was\r\nexcessively cold, and the Wallabout Bay was frozen over. One night\r\na number of prisoners took advantage of this to make their escape by\r\nlowering themselves from a port hole on to the ice. It is recorded that\r\nthe cold was so excessive that one man was frozen to death, that the\r\nBritish pursued the party and brought a few of them back, but that a\r\nnumber succeeded in making their escape to New Jersey. Who these men\r\nwere we have been unable to discover. Tradition also states that while\r\nWallabout Bay was thus frozen over the Long Island market women skated\r\nacross it, with supplies of vegetables in large hampers attached to\r\ntheir backs, and that some of them came near enough to throw some of\r\ntheir supplies to the half-famished prisoners on board the Jersey.\r\n\r\nIt would appear that these poor sufferers had warm friends in the\r\nfarmers who lived on the shores of the Wallabout. Of these Mr. A.\r\nRemsen, who owned a mill at the mouth of a creek which empties into the\r\nBay, was one of the most benevolent, and it was his daughter who is said\r\nto have kept a list of the number of bodies that were interred in the\r\nsand in the neighborhood of the mill and house. In 1780 Mr Remsen hid an\r\nescaped prisoner, Major H. Wyckoff, for several days in one of his upper\r\nrooms, while at the same time the young lieutenant of the guard of the\r\nJersey was quartered in the house. Remsen also lent Captain Wyckoff as\r\nmuch money as he needed, and finally, one dark night, safely conveyed\r\nhim in a sleigh to Cow Neck. From thence he crossed to Poughkeepsie.\r\n\r\nAlthough little mention is made by those prisoners who have left\r\naccounts of their experiences while on board the Jersey, of any aid\r\nreceived by them from the American government the following passage from\r\na Connecticut paper would seem to indicate that such aid was tendered\r\nthem at least for a time. It is possible that Congress sent some\r\nprovisions to the prison-ships for her imprisoned soldiers, or marines,\r\nbut made no provision for the crews of privateers.\r\n\r\n“New London. September 1st. 1779. D. Stanton testifies that he was taken\r\nJune 5th, and put in the Jersey prison ship. An allowance from Congress\r\nwas sent on board. About three or four weeks past we were removed on\r\nboard the Good Hope, where we found many sick. There is now a hospital\r\nship provided, to which they are removed and good attention paid.”\r\n\r\nThe next extract that we will quote probably refers to the escape of\r\nprisoners on the ice referred to above.\r\n\r\n“New London. Conn. Feb. 16th. 1780. Fifteen prisoners arrived here who\r\nthree weeks ago escaped from the prison-ship in the East River. A number\r\nof others escaped about the same time from the same ship, some of whom\r\nbeing frost-bitten and unable to endure the cold, were taken up and\r\ncarried back, one frozen to death before he reached the shore.”\r\n\r\n“_Rivington’s Gazette_, Dec. 19th 1780. George Batterman, who had been\r\na prisoner on board the prison ship at New York, deposes that he had had\r\neight ounces of condemned bread per day; and eight ounces of meat. He\r\nwas afterwards put on board the Jersey, where were, as was supposed,\r\n1,100 prisoners; recruiting officers came on board and finding that the\r\nAmerican officers persuaded the men not to enlist, removed them, as he\r\nwas told, to the Provost. The prisoners were tempted to enlist to free\r\nthemselves from confinement, hopeless of exchange. * * * The prisoners\r\nhad a pint of water per day:--the sick were not sent to the hospitals\r\nuntil they were so weak and ill that they often expired before they got\r\nout of the Jersey. The commanding officer said his orders were that if\r\nthe ship took fire we should all be turned below, and left to perish in\r\nthe flames. By accident the ship took fire in the steward’s room, when\r\nthe Hessian guards were ordered to drive the prisoners below, and fire\r\namong them if they resisted or got in the water.”\r\n\r\nTalbot in his Memoirs stated that: “When the weather became cool and\r\ndry in the fall and the nights frosty the number of deaths on board the\r\nJersey was _reduced_ to an average of ten per day! which was _small_\r\ncompared with the mortality for three months before. The human bones\r\nand skulls yet bleaching on the shore of Long Island, and exposed by the\r\nfalling down of the high bank, on which the prisoners were buried, is a\r\nshocking sight.” (Talbot, page 106.)\r\n\r\nIn May, 1808, one William Burke of New York testified that “He was a\r\nprisoner in the Jersey 14 months, has known many American prisoners put\r\nto death by the bayonet. It was the custom for but one prisoner at a\r\ntime to go on deck. One night while many prisoners were assembled at the\r\ngrate, at the hatchway to obtain fresh air, and waiting their turn to\r\ngo on deck, a sentinel thrust his bayonet down among them, and 25 next\r\nmorning were found to be dead. This was the case several mornings, when\r\nsometimes six, and sometimes eight or ten were found dead by wounds thus\r\nreceived.”\r\n\r\nA Connecticut paper, some time in May, 1781, stated that. “Eleven\r\nhundred French and American prisoners died in New York last winter.”\r\n\r\nA paper published in Philadelphia, on the 20th of February, 1782, says:\r\n“Many of our unfortunate prisoners on board the prison ships in the East\r\nRiver have perished during the late extreme weather, for want of fuel\r\nand other necessaries.”\r\n\r\n“New London. May 3rd. 1782. One thousand of our seamen remain in prison\r\nships in New York, a great part in close confinement for six months\r\npast, and in a most deplorable condition. Five hundred have died during\r\nthe past five or six months, three hundred are sick; many seeing no\r\nprospect of release are entering the British service to elude the\r\ncontagion with which the prison ships are fraught.”\r\n\r\nJoel Barlow in his Columbiad says that Mr. Elias Boudinot told him that\r\nin the Jersey 1,100 prisoners died in eighteen months, almost the whole\r\nof them from the barbarous treatment of being stifled in a crowded hold\r\nwith infected air; and poisoned with unwholesome food, and Mr Barlow\r\nadds that the cruelties exercised by the British armies on American\r\nprisoners during the first years of the war were unexampled among\r\ncivilized nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch of the prisoners as escaped after months of suffering with health\r\nsufficient for future usefulness in the field often re-enlisted, burning\r\nfor revenge.\r\n\r\nMr. Scharf, in his “History of Western Maryland,” speaks of Colonel\r\nWilliam Kunkel, who had served in Prussia, and emigrated to America\r\nabout the year 1732. He first settled in Lancaster, Pa., but afterwards\r\nmoved to Western Maryland. He had six sons in the Revolution. One of\r\nthese sons entered the American army at the age of eighteen. Taken\r\nprisoner he was sent on board the Jersey, where his sufferings were\r\nterrible. On his return home after his exchange he vowed to his father\r\nthat he would return to the army and fight until the last redcoat was\r\ndriven out of the country. He did return, and from that time, says Mr\r\nScharf, his family never heard from him again.\r\n\r\nMr. Crimmins in his “Irish-American Historical Miscellany,” says: “An\r\nespecially affecting incident is told regarding one prisoner who died\r\non the Jersey. Two young men, brothers, belonging to a rifle corps were\r\nmade prisoners, and sent on board the ship. The elder took the fever,\r\nand in a few days became delirious. One night as his end was fast\r\napproaching, he became calm and sensible, and lamenting his hard fate,\r\nand the absence of his mother, begged for a little water. His brother\r\nwith tears, entreated the guard to give him some, but in vain. The sick\r\nyouth was soon in his last struggles, when his brother offered the guard\r\na guinea for an inch of candle, only that he might see him die. Even\r\nthis was denied.”\r\n\r\nThe young rifleman died in the dark.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said his brother, drying his tears, “if it please God that I ever\r\nregain my liberty, I’ll be a most bitter enemy!”\r\n\r\nHe was exchanged, rejoined the army, and when the war ended he is said\r\nto have had eight large and one hundred and twenty-seven small notches\r\non his rifle stock. The inference is that he made a notch every time he\r\nkilled or wounded a British soldier, a large notch for an officer, and a\r\nsmall one for a private.\r\n\r\nMr. Lecky, the English historian, thus speaks of American prisoners:\r\n“The American prisoners who had been confined in New York after the\r\nbattle of Long Island were so emaciated and broken down by scandalous\r\nneglect or ill usage that Washington refused to receive them in exchange\r\nfor an equal number of healthy British and Hessian troops. * * * It is\r\nbut justice to the Americans to add that their conduct during the war\r\nappears to have been almost uniformly humane. No charges of neglect\r\nof prisoners, like those which were brought, apparently with too good\r\nreason, against the English, were substantiated against them. The\r\nconduct of Washington was marked by a careful and steady humanity, and\r\nFranklin, also, appears to have done much to mitigate the war.”\r\n\r\nOur task is now concluded. We have concerned ourselves with the\r\nprisoners themselves, not much with the history of the negotiations\r\ncarried on to effect exchange, but have left this part of the subject\r\nto some abler hand. Only a very small part of the story has been told\r\nin this volume, and there is much room for future investigations. It\r\nis highly probable that if a systematic search is made many unpublished\r\naccounts may be discovered, and a great deal of light shed upon the\r\nhorrors of the British prisons. If we have awakened interest in the sad\r\nfate of so many of our brave countrymen, and aroused some readers to a\r\nfeeling of compassion for their misfortunes, and admiration for their\r\nheroism, our task has not been in vain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX A\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF 8000 MEN WHO WERE PRISONERS ON BOARD THE OLD JERSEY\r\n\r\nPRINTED BY PERMISSION OF THE SOCIETY OF OLD BROOKLYNITES\r\n\r\nThis list of names was copied from the papers of the British War\r\nDepartment. There is nothing to indicate what became of any of these\r\nprisoners, whether they died, escaped, or were exchanged. The list\r\nseems to have been carelessly kept, and is full of obvious mistakes in\r\nspelling the names. Yet it shall be given just as it is, except that\r\nthe names are arranged differently, for easier reference. This list\r\nof prisoners is the only one that could be found in the British War\r\nDepartment. What became of the lists of prisoners on the many other\r\nprison ships, and prisons, used by the English in America, we do not\r\nknow.\r\n\r\n     Garret Aarons\r\n     John Aarons (2)\r\n     Alexander Abbett\r\n     John Abbett\r\n     James Abben\r\n     John Abbott\r\n     Daniel Abbott\r\n     Abel Abel\r\n     George Abel\r\n     Jacob Aberry\r\n     Jabez Abett\r\n     Philip Abing\r\n     Thomas Abington\r\n     Christopher Abois\r\n     William Aboms\r\n     Daniel Abrams\r\n     Don Meegl (Miguel) Abusure\r\n     Gansio Acito\r\n     Abel Adams\r\n     Amos Adams\r\n     Benjamin Adams\r\n     David Adams\r\n     Isaac Adams\r\n     John Adams (4)\r\n     Lawrence Adams\r\n     Moses Adams\r\n     Nathaniel Adams\r\n     Pisco Adams\r\n     Richard Adams\r\n     Stephen Adams\r\n     Thomas Adams\r\n     Warren Adams\r\n     Amos Addams\r\n     Thomas Addett\r\n     Benjamin Addison\r\n     David Addon\r\n     John Adlott\r\n     Robert Admistad\r\n     Noah Administer\r\n     Wm Adamson (2)\r\n     John Adobon\r\n     James Adovie\r\n     Sebastian de Aedora\r\n     Jean Aenbie\r\n     Michael Aessinis\r\n     Frances Affille\r\n     Joseph Antonio Aguirra\r\n     Thomas Aguynoble\r\n     John Aires\r\n     Robert Aitken\r\n     Thomas Aiz\r\n     Manuel Ajote\r\n     Jacob Akins\r\n     Joseph Aker (2)\r\n     Richard Akerson\r\n     Charles Albert\r\n     Piere Albert\r\n     Robert Albion\r\n     Joachin Alconan\r\n     Joseph de Alcorta\r\n     Juan Ignacid Alcorta\r\n     Pedro Aldaronda\r\n     Humphrey Alden\r\n     Fred Aldkin\r\n     George Aldridge\r\n     Jacob Alehipike\r\n     Jean Aleslure\r\n     Archibald Alexander\r\n     John Alexander (2)\r\n     Lehle Alexander\r\n     William Alexander\r\n     Thomas Alger\r\n     Christopher Aliet\r\n     Joseph Aliev\r\n     George Alignott\r\n     Joseph Allah\r\n     Gideon Allan\r\n     Hugh Allan\r\n     Francis Allegree\r\n     Baeknel Allen\r\n     Bancke Allen\r\n     Benjamin Allen\r\n     Bucknell Allen\r\n     Ebeneser Allen\r\n     George Allen\r\n     Gideon Allen\r\n     Isaac Allen\r\n     John Allen (5)\r\n     Josiah Allen\r\n     Murgo Allen\r\n     Richard Allen (2)\r\n     Samuel Allen (7)\r\n     Squire Allen\r\n     Thomas Allen (3)\r\n     William Allen (4)\r\n     Jean Allin\r\n     Caleb Allis\r\n     Bradby Allison\r\n     Bradey Allison\r\n     James Allison\r\n     Frances Alment\r\n     Arrohan Almon\r\n     Aceth Almond\r\n     William Alpin\r\n     Jacob Alsfrugh\r\n     Jacob Alsough\r\n     Jacob Alstright\r\n     Jacob Alsworth\r\n     Thomas Alvarey\r\n     Miguel Alveras\r\n     Don Ambrose Alverd\r\n     Joseph Alvey\r\n     James Alwhite\r\n     George Alwood\r\n     James Alwood\r\n     Charles Amey\r\n     Anthony Amingo\r\n     Manuel Amizarma\r\n     Nathaniel Anabel\r\n     Austin Anaga\r\n     Jean Ancette\r\n     Charles Anderson\r\n     Joseph Anderson\r\n     Robert Anderson\r\n     William Anderson (3)\r\n     George Andre\r\n     Benjamin Andrews\r\n     Charles Andrews\r\n     Dollar Andrews\r\n     Ebeneser Andrews\r\n     Francis Andrews\r\n     Frederick Andrews\r\n     Jerediah Andrews\r\n     John Andrews (4)\r\n     Jonathan Andrews\r\n     Pascal Andrews\r\n     Philany Andrews\r\n     Thomas Andrews\r\n     William Andrews\r\n     Guillion Andrie\r\n     Pashal Andrie\r\n     Dominique Angola\r\n     Andre D.

Through his\r\ncourtesy I am allowed to publish it here. I am sorry I did not receive\r\nit in time to embody it in the first part of this book.\r\n\r\nD D\r\n\r\nDoubtless all of us are more or less familiar with the prison ship\r\nchapter of Revolutionary history, as this is one of the greatest, if\r\nnot the greatest, tragedies of the struggle for independence. At the\r\nbeginning of the hostilities the British had in New York Harbor a number\r\nof transports on which cattle and stores had been brought over in 1776.\r\nThese vessels lay in Gravesend Bay and later were taken up the East\r\nRiver and anchored in Wallabout Bay, and to their number were added from\r\ntime to time vessels in such condition that they were of no use except\r\nas prisons for American troops The names of many of these infamous ships\r\nhave been preserved, the Whitby, the Good Hope, the Hunter, Prince of\r\nWales, and others, and worst of all, the Jersey.\r\n\r\nIt was proposed to confine captured American seamen in these ships, but\r\nthey also served as prisons for thousands of patriot soldiers taken\r\nin the land engagements in and about New York. The men were crowded in\r\nthese small vessels under conditions which pass belief. They suffered\r\nuntold misery and died by hundreds from lack of food, from exposure,\r\nsmallpox and other dreadful diseases, and from the cruelty of their\r\ncaptors. The average death rate on the Jersey alone was ten per night. A\r\nconservative estimate places the total number of victims at 11,500. The\r\ndead were carried ashore and thrown into shallow graves or trenches of\r\nsand and these conditions of horror continued from the beginning of the\r\nwar until after peace was declared. Few prisoners escaped and not many\r\nwere exchanged, for their conditions were such that commanding officers\r\nhesitated to exchange healthy British prisoners in fine condition for\r\nthe wasted, worn-out, human wrecks from the prison ships. A very large\r\nproportion of the total number of these prisoners perished. Of the\r\nsurvivors, many never fully recovered from their sufferings.\r\n\r\nIn 1808, it was said of the prison ship martyrs: “Dreadful, beyond\r\ndescription, was the condition of these unfortunate prisoners of war.\r\nTheir sufferings and their sorrows were great, and unbounded was their\r\nfortitude. Under every privation and every anguish of life, they firmly\r\nencountered the terrors of death, rather than desert the cause of their\r\ncountry. * * *\r\n\r\n“There was no morsel of wholesome food, nor one drop of pure water. In\r\nthese black abodes of wretchedness and woe, the grief worn prisoner lay,\r\nwithout a bed to rest his weary limbs, without a pillow to support his\r\naching head--the tattered garment torn from his meager frame, and vermin\r\npreying on his flesh--his food was carrion, and his drink foul as the\r\nbilge water--there was no balm for his wounds, no cordial to revive his\r\nfainting spirits, no friend to comfort his heart, nor the soft hand of\r\naffection to close his dying eyes--heaped amongst the dead, while yet\r\nthe spark of life lingered in his frame, and hurried to the grave before\r\nthe cold arms of death had embraced him. * * *\r\n\r\n“‘But,’ you will ask, ‘was there no relief for these victims of misery?’\r\nNo--there was no relief--their astonishing sufferings were concealed\r\nfrom the view of the world--and it was only from the few witnesses of\r\nthe scene who afterwards lived to tell the cruelties they had endured,\r\nthat our country became acquainted with their deplorable condition. The\r\ngrim sentinels, faithful to their charge as the fiends of the nether\r\nworld, barred the doors against the hand of charity, and godlike\r\nbenevolence never entered there--compassion had fled from these mansions\r\nof despair, and pity wept over other woes.”\r\n\r\nNumerous accounts of survivors of the prison ships have been preserved\r\nand some of them have been published. So great was popular sympathy\r\nfor them that immediately after the close of the Revolutionary War an\r\nattempt was made to gather the testimony of the survivors and to provide\r\na fitting memorial for those who had perished. So far as I have been\r\nable to learn most of the diaries and journals and other testimony\r\nof the prison ship victims relates to the later years of the war and\r\nparticularly to the Jersey, the largest, most conspicuous, and most\r\nhorrible of all the prison ships.\r\n\r\nI have been so fortunate as to have access to a journal or diary kept\r\nby William Slade, of New Canaan, Conn, a young New Englander, who early\r\nresponded to the call of his country and was captured by the British in\r\n1776, shortly after his enlistment, and confined on one of the prison\r\nships, the Grovner (or Grovesner). From internal evidence it would\r\nappear that this was the first or one of the first vessels used for the\r\npurpose and that Slade and the other prisoners with him were the first\r\nof the American soldiers thus confined. At any rate, throughout his\r\ndiary he makes no mention of other bands of prisoners in the same\r\ncondition The few small pages of this little diary, which was always\r\nkept in the possession of his family until it was deposited in the\r\nSheldon Museum, of Middlebury, Vt, contain a plain record of every-day\r\nlife throughout a period of great suffering. They do not discuss\r\nquestions of State and policy, but they do seem to me to bring clearly\r\nbefore the mind’s eye conditions as they existed, and perhaps more\r\nclearly than elaborate treatises to give a picture of the sufferings of\r\nsoldiers and sailors who preferred to endure all privations, hardships,\r\nand death itself rather than to renounce their allegiance to their\r\ncountry and enlist under the British flag.\r\n\r\nThe first entry in the Slade diary was made November 16, 1776, and the\r\nlast January 28, 1777, so it covers about ten weeks.\r\n\r\nThe entries were as follows:\r\n\r\nFort Washington the 16th day November A.D. 1776. This day I, William\r\nSlade was taken with 2,800 more. We was allowed honours of War. We then\r\nmarched to Harlem under guard, where we were turned into a barn.

He was\r\none of the early settlers who went from Connecticut to Vermont and made\r\na home in what was then a frontier settlement. He lived and died at\r\nCornwall, Vt., and was successful and respected in the community.\r\nFrom 1801 to 1810 he was sheriff of Addison County. Of his sons, one,\r\nWilliam, was especially conspicuous among the men of his generation for\r\nhis abilities and attainments. After graduation from Middlebury College\r\nin 1810, he studied law, was admitted to the bar, and filled many\r\noffices in his town and county. After some business reverses he secured\r\na position in the State Department in Washington in 1821. He was on the\r\nwrong side politically in General Jackson’s campaign for the presidency,\r\nbeing like most Vermonters a supporter of John Quincy Adams. Some time\r\nafter Jackson’s inauguration, Slade was removed from his position in\r\nthe State Department and this so incensed his friends in Vermont that\r\nas soon as a vacancy arose he was elected as Representative to Congress,\r\nwhere he remained from 1831 to 1843. On his return from Washington he\r\nwas elected Governor of Vermont in 1844, and in his later years was\r\ncorresponding secretary and general agent of the Board of National\r\nand Popular Education, for which he did most valuable work. He was a\r\ndistinguished speaker and an author of note, his Vermont State Papers\r\nbeing still a standard reference work.\r\n\r\nTo revert to the prison ship martyrs, their suffering was so great and\r\ntheir bravery so conspicuous that immediately after the War a popular\r\nattempt was made in 1792 and 1798 to provide a proper resting place\r\nfor the bones of the victims, which were scattered in the sands about\r\nWallabout Bay. This effort did not progress very rapidly and it was\r\nnot until the matter was taken up by the Tammany Society that anything\r\ndefinite was really accomplished. Owing to the efforts of this\r\norganization a vault covered by a small building was erected in 1808\r\nand the bones were collected and placed in the vault in thirteen large\r\ncoffins, one for each of the thirteen colonies, the interment being\r\naccompanied by imposing ceremonies. In time the vault was neglected, and\r\nit was preserved only by the efforts of a survivor, Benjamin Romaine,\r\nwho bought the plot of ground on which the monument stood, when it was\r\nsold for taxes, and preserved it. He died at an advanced age and was, by\r\nhis own request, buried in the vault with these Revolutionary heroes.\r\n\r\nEarly in the last century an attempt was made to interest Congress in\r\na project to erect a suitable monument for the prison ship martyrs\r\nbut without success. The project has, however, never been abandoned\r\nby patriotic and public spirited citizens and the Prison Ship Martyrs’\r\nSociety of the present time is a lineal descendant in spirit and purpose\r\nof the Tammany Club effort, which first honored these Revolutionary\r\nheroes. The efforts of the Prison Ship Martyrs’ Association have proved\r\nsuccessful and a beautiful monument, designed by Stanford White, will\r\nsoon mark the resting place of these prison ship martyrs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX C\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe writer of this volume has been very much assisted in her task by Mr.\r\nFrank Moore’s Diary of the Revolution, a collection of extracts from the\r\nperiodicals of the day.
