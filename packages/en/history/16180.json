Scot.\r\n\r\nAUTHOR OF\r\n\r\n'BIBLE TEACHINGS IN NATURE,' 'FIRST FORMS OF VEGETATION,'\r\n'HOLIDAYS IN HIGH LANDS,' 'THE RIVIERA,' ETC.\r\n\r\nLondon\r\n\r\nMACMILLAN AND CO.\r\n\r\nAND NEW YORK\r\n\r\n1888\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe title of this book may seem fanciful. It may even be regarded as\r\nmisleading, creating the idea that it is a treatise like that of Mr.\r\nDigby Wyatt on those peculiar works of art which decorate the old\r\npalaces and churches of Rome. But notwithstanding these objections, no\r\ntitle can more adequately describe the nature of the book. It is\r\napplicable on account of the miscellaneous character of the chapters,\r\nwhich have already appeared in some of our leading magazines and\r\nreviews, and are now, with considerable changes and additions,\r\ngathered together into a volume. There is a further suitableness in\r\nthe title, owing to the fact that most of the contents have no claim\r\nto originality. As a Roman Mosaic is made up of small coloured cubes\r\njoined together in such a manner as to form a picture, so my book may\r\nbe said to be made up of old facts gathered from many sources and\r\nharmonised into a significant unity. So many thousands of volumes\r\nhave been written about Rome that it is impossible to say anything new\r\nregarding it. Every feature of its topography and every incident of\r\nits history have been described. Every sentiment appropriate to the\r\nsubject has been expressed. But Rome can be regarded from countless\r\npoints of view, and studied for endless objects. Each visitor's mind\r\nis a different prism with angles of thought that break up the subject\r\ninto its own colours. And as is the case in a mosaic, old materials\r\ncan be brought into new combinations, and a new picture constructed\r\nout of them. It is on this ground that I venture to add another book\r\nto the bewildering pile of literature on Rome.\r\n\r\nBut I have another reason to offer. While the great mass of the\r\nmaterials of the book is old and familiar, not a few things are\r\nintroduced that are comparatively novel. The late Dean Alford made the\r\nremark how difficult it is to obtain in Rome those details of interest\r\nwhich can be so easily got in other cities. Guide-books contain a vast\r\namount of information, but there are many points interesting to the\r\nantiquarian and the historian which they overlook altogether. There is\r\nno English book, for instance, like Ruffini's _Dizionario\r\nEtimologico-Storico delle Strade, Piazze, Borghi e Vicoli della Città\r\ndi Roma_, to tell one of the origin of the strange and bizarre names\r\nof the streets of Rome, many of which involve most interesting\r\nhistorical facts and most romantic associations of the past. There is\r\nno English book on the ancient marbles of Rome like Corsi's _Pietre\r\nAntiche_, which describes the mineralogy and source of the building\r\nmaterials of the imperial city, and traces their history from the law\r\ncourts and temples of which they first formed part to the churches and\r\npalaces in which they may now be seen. Every nook in London, with its\r\nmemories and points of interest, has been chronicled in a form that is\r\naccessible to every one. But there is an immense amount of most\r\ninteresting antiquarian lore regarding out-of-the-way things in Rome\r\nwhich is buried in the transactions of learned societies or in special\r\nItalian monographs, and is therefore altogether beyond the reach of\r\nthe ordinary visitor. Science has lately shed its vivid light upon the\r\nphysical history of the Roman plain; and the researches of the\r\narchæologist have brought into the daylight of modern knowledge, and\r\nby a wider comparison and induction have invested with a new\r\nsignificance, the prehistoric objects, customs, and traditions which\r\nmake primeval Rome and the surrounding sites so fascinating to the\r\nimagination. But these results are not to be found in the books which\r\nthe English visitor usually consults. In the following chapters I have\r\nendeavoured to supply some of that curious knowledge; and it is to be\r\nhoped that what is given--for it is no more than a slight sample out\r\nof an almost boundless store--will create an interest in such\r\nsubjects, and induce the reader to go in search of fuller information.\r\n\r\nMany of the points touched upon have provoked endless disputations\r\nwhich are not likely soon to be settled. Indeed there is hardly any\r\nline of study one can take up in connection with Rome which does not\r\nbristle with controversies; and a feeling of perplexity and\r\nuncertainty continually haunts one in regard to most of the subjects.\r\nIt is not only in the vague field of the early traditions of the city,\r\nand of the medieval traditions of the Church, that this feeling\r\noppresses one; it exists everywhere, even in the more solid and\r\nassured world of Roman art, literature, and history. Where it is so\r\ndifficult to arrive at settled convictions, I may be pardoned if I\r\nhave expressed views that are open to reconsideration.\r\n\r\nI am aware of the disadvantages connected with thus collecting\r\ntogether a number of separate papers, instead of writing a uniform\r\ntreatise upon one continuous subject. The picture formed by their\r\nunion must necessarily have much of the artificiality and clumsiness\r\nof the mosaic as compared with the oil or water-colour painting. But\r\nonly in this form could I have brought together such a great variety\r\nof important things. And though I cannot hope that the inherent defect\r\nof the mosaic will be compensated by its permanence--for books of this\r\nkind do not last--yet it will surely serve some good purpose to have\r\nsuch a collocation of facts regarding a place whose interest is ever\r\nvarying and never dying.\r\n\r\nThe personal element is almost entirely confined to the first chapter,\r\nwhich deals on that account with more familiar incidents than the\r\nothers. Twelve years have elapsed since my memorable sojourn in Rome;\r\nand many changes have occurred in the Eternal City since then. I have\r\nhad no opportunity to repeat my visit and to add to or correct my\r\nfirst impressions, desirable as it might be to have had such a\r\nrevision for the sake of this book. I duly drank of the water of Trevi\r\nthe night before I left; but the spell has been in abeyance all these\r\nyears. I live, however, in the hope that it has not altogether lost\r\nits mystic power; and that some day, not too far off, I may be\r\nprivileged to go over the old scenes with other and larger eyes than\r\nthose with which I first reverently gazed upon them. It needs two\r\nvisits at least to form any true conception of Rome: a first visit to\r\nacquire the personal interest in the city which will lead at home to\r\nthe eager search for knowledge regarding it from every source; and\r\nthen the second visit to bring the mind thus quickened and richly\r\nstored with information to bear with new comprehension and increased\r\ninterest upon the study of its antiquities on the spot.\r\n\r\n    HUGH MACMILLAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nA WALK TO CHURCH IN ROME\r\n\r\nA Walk to Church in Country--In the Town--Residence in Capo le\r\nCase--Church of San Guiseppe--Propaganda--Pillar of Immaculate\r\nConception--Piazza di Spagna--Staircase--Models--Beggars--Church of\r\nTrinita dei Monti--Flowers--Via Babuino--Piazza del Popolo--Flaminian\r\nObelisk--Pincian Hill--Porta del Popolo--Church of Santa Maria del\r\nPopolo--Monastery of St. Augustine--Presbyterian Church--Villa\r\nBorghese--Ponte Molle\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE APPIAN WAY\r\n\r\nFormation of Appian Way--Tombs on Roman Roads--Loneliness of Country\r\noutside Rome--Porta Capena--Restoration of Appian Way--Grove and\r\nFountain of Egeria--Baths of Caracalla--Church of Sts.

All the lovely promises of spring have\r\nbeen fulfilled; the woods are clothed with their darkest foliage, and\r\nnot another leaflet is to come anywhere. The lingering plumes of the\r\nmeadow-sweet in the fields, and the golden trumpets of the wild\r\nhoneysuckle in the hedges, make the warm air a luxury to breathe; and\r\nthe presence of a few tufts of bluebells by the wayside gives the\r\nlandscape the last finishing touch of perfection, which is suggestive\r\nof decay, and has such an indescribable pathos about it. Nature pauses\r\nto admire her own handiwork; she ceases from her labours, and enjoys\r\nan interval of rest. It is the sabbath of the year. At such a time\r\nevery object is associated with its spiritual idea, as it is with its\r\nnatural shadow. The beauty of nature suggests thoughts of the beauty\r\nof holiness; and the calm rest of creation speaks to us of the deeper\r\nrest of the soul in God. On the shadowed path that leads up to the\r\nhouse of prayer, with mind and senses quickened to perceive the\r\nloveliness and significance of the smallest object, the fern on the\r\nbank and the lichen on the wall, we feel indeed that heaven is not so\r\nmuch a yonder, towards which we are to move, as a here and a now,\r\nwhich we are to realise.\r\n\r\nA walk to church in town is a different thing. Man's works are all\r\naround us, and God's excluded; all but the strip of blue sky that\r\nlooks down between the tall houses, and suggests thoughts of heaven to\r\nthose who work and weep; all but the stunted trees and the green grass\r\nthat struggle to grow in the hard streets and squares, and whisper of\r\nthe far-off scenes of the country, where life is natural and simple.\r\nBut even in town a walk to church is pleasant, especially when the\r\nstreets are quiet, before the crowd of worshippers have begun to\r\nassemble, and there is nothing to distract the thoughts. If we can say\r\nof the country walk, \"This is holy ground,\" seeing that every bush and\r\ntree are aflame with God, we can say of the walk through the city,\r\n\"Surely the Lord hath been here, this is a dreadful place.\" And as the\r\nrude rough stones lying on the mountain top shaped themselves in the\r\npatriarch's dream into a staircase leading up to God, so the streets\r\nand houses around become to the musing spirit suggestive of the\r\nFather's many mansions, and the glories of the City whose streets are\r\nof pure gold, in which man's hopes and aspirations after a city of\r\nrest, which are baffled here, will be realised. I have many pleasing\r\nassociations connected with walks to church in town. Many precious\r\nthoughts have come to me then, which would not have occurred at other\r\ntimes; glimpses of the wonder of life, and revelations of inscrutable\r\nmysteries covered by the dream-woven tissue of this visible world. The\r\nsubjects with which my mind was filled found new illustrations in the\r\nmost unexpected quarters; and every familiar sight and sound furnished\r\nthe most appropriate examples. During that half-hour of meditation,\r\nwith my blood quickened by the exercise, and my mind inspired by the\r\nthoughts of the service in which I was about to engage, I have lived\r\nan intenser life and enjoyed a keener happiness than during all the\r\nrest of the week. It was the hour of insight that struck the keynote\r\nof all the others.\r\n\r\nBut far above even these precious memories, I must rank my walks to\r\nchurch in Rome. What one feels elsewhere is deepened there; and the\r\nwonderful associations of the place give a more vivid interest to all\r\none's experiences. I lived in the Capo le Case, a steep street on the\r\nslope between the Pincian and Quirinal hills, situated about\r\nthree-quarters of a mile from the church outside the Porta del Popolo.\r\nThis distance I had to traverse every Sunday morning; and I love\r\nfrequently to shut my eyes and picture the streets through which I\r\npassed, and the old well-known look of the houses and monuments. There\r\nis not a more delightful walk in the world than that; and I know not\r\nwhere within such a narrow compass could be found so many objects of\r\nthe most thrilling interest. For three months, from the beginning of\r\nFebruary to the end of April, twice, and sometimes four times, every\r\nSunday, I passed that way, going to or returning from church, until I\r\nbecame perfectly familiar with every object; and associations of my\r\nown moods of mind and heart mingled with the grander associations\r\nwhich every stone recalled, and are now inextricably bound up with\r\nthem. With one solitary exception, when the weather in its chill winds\r\nand gloomy clouds reminded me of my native climate, all the Sundays\r\nwere beautiful, the sun shining down with genial warmth, and the sky\r\noverhead exhibiting the deep violet hue which belongs especially to\r\nItaly. The house in which I lived had on either side of the entrance a\r\npicture-shop; and this was always closed, as well as most of the other\r\nplaces of business along the route. The streets were remarkably quiet;\r\nand all the circumstances were most favourable for a meditative walk\r\namid such magnificent memories. The inhabitants of Rome pay respect to\r\nthe Sunday so far as abstaining from labour is concerned; but they\r\nmake up for this by throwing open their museums and places of interest\r\non that day, which indeed is the only day in which they are free to\r\nthe public; and they take a large amount of recreation for doing a\r\nsmall amount of penance in the interests of religion. Still there is\r\nvery little bustle or traffic in the streets, especially in the\r\nmorning; and one meets with no more disagreeable and incongruous\r\ninterruptions on the way to church in the Eternal City than he does at\r\nhome. At the head of the Capo le Case is a small church, beside an old\r\nruinous-looking wall of tufa, covered with shaggy pellitory and other\r\nplants, which might well have been one of the ramparts of ancient\r\nRome. It is called San Guiseppe, and has a faded fresco painting on\r\nthe gable, representing the Flight of the Holy Family into Egypt,\r\nsupposed to be by Frederico Zuccari, whose own house--similarly\r\ndecorated on the outside with frescoes--was in the immediate vicinity.\r\nFrom the windows of my rooms, I could see at the foot of the street\r\nthe fantastic cupola and bell-turret of the church of St. Andrea delle\r\nFratte, which belonged to the Scottish Catholics before the\r\nReformation, and is now frequented by our Catholic countrymen during\r\nLent, when sermons are preached to them in English. It is the parish\r\nchurch of the Piazza di Spagna, and the so-called English quarter. The\r\npresent edifice was only built at the end of the sixteenth century,\r\nand, strange to say, with the proceeds of the sale of Cardinal\r\nGonsalvi's valuable collection of snuff-boxes; but its name, derived\r\nfrom the Italian word _Fratta_, \"thorn-bush,\" would seem to imply that\r\nthe church is of much greater antiquity, going back to a far-off time\r\nwhen the ground on which it stands was an uncultivated waste. A\r\nmiracle is said to have happened in one of the side chapels in 1842,\r\nwhich received the sanction of the Pope. A young French Jew of the\r\nname of Alfonse Ratisbonne was discovered in an ecstasy before the\r\naltar; which he accounted for by saying, when he revived, that the\r\nVirgin Mary had actually appeared to him, and saluted him in this\r\nplace, while he was wandering aimlessly, and with a smile of\r\nincredulity, through the church. This supernatural vision led to his\r\nconversion, and he was publicly baptized and presented to the Pope by\r\nhis godfather, the general of the Jesuits; receiving on the occasion,\r\nin commemoration of the miracle, a crucifix, to which special\r\nindulgences were attached.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the Capo le Case is the College of the Propaganda,\r\nwhose vast size and plain massive architecture, as well as its\r\nhistorical associations, powerfully impress the imagination. It was\r\nbegun by Gregory XV., in 1622, and completed by his successor, Urban\r\nVIII., and his brother, Cardinal Antonio Barberini, from the plans\r\npartly of Bernini and Borromini. On the most prominent parts of the\r\nedifice are sculptured bees, which are the well-known armorial\r\nbearings of the Barberini family. The Propaganda used to divide with\r\nthe Vatican the administration of the whole Roman Catholic world. It\r\nwas compared by the Abbé Raynal to a sword, of which the handle\r\nremains in Rome, and the point reaches everywhere. The Vatican takes\r\ncognisance of what may be called the domestic affairs of the Church\r\nthroughout Europe; the College of the Propaganda superintends the\r\nforeign policy of the Church, and makes its influence felt in the\r\nremotest regions of the earth. It is essentially, as its name implies,\r\na missionary institution, founded for the promotion and guidance of\r\nmissions throughout the world. Nearly two hundred youths from various\r\ncountries are constantly educated here, in order that they may go back\r\nas ordained priests to their native land, and diffuse the Roman\r\nCatholic faith among their countrymen. The average number ordained\r\nevery year is about fifty. No one is admitted who is over twenty years\r\nof age; and they all wear a uniform dress, consisting of a long black\r\ncassock, edged with red, and bound with a red girdle, with two bands,\r\nrepresenting leading-strings, hanging from the shoulders behind. The\r\ncost of their education and support while in Rome, and the expenses of\r\ntheir journey from their native land and back again, are defrayed by\r\nthe institution. Every visitor to Rome must be familiar with the\r\nappearance of the students, as they walk through the streets in groups\r\nof three or four, eagerly conversing with each other, with many\r\nexpressive gesticulations. For the most part they are a fine set of\r\nyoung men, of whom any Church might well be proud, full of zeal and\r\nenergy, and well fitted to encounter, by their physical as well as\r\ntheir mental training, the hard-ships of an isolated life, frequently\r\namong savage races.\r\n\r\nAn annual exhibition is held in a large hall attached to the college\r\nin honour of the holy Magi, about the beginning of January, when\r\nstudents deliver speeches in different languages, and take part in\r\nmusical performances, the score of which is usually composed by the\r\nprofessor of music in the college. The places of honour nearest the\r\nstage are occupied by several cardinals, whose scarlet dresses and\r\nsilver locks contrast strikingly with the black garments of the\r\nmajority of the assemblage. The strange costumes and countenances of\r\nthe speakers, coloured with every hue known to the human family, the\r\nnovel sounds of the different languages, and the personal\r\npeculiarities of each speaker in manner and intonation, make the\r\nexhibition in the highest degree interesting. Its great popularity is\r\nevinced by the crowds that usually attend, filling the hall to\r\noverflowing; and though a religious affair, it is pervaded by a lively\r\nspirit of fun, in which even the great dignitaries of the Church join\r\nheartily.\r\n\r\nThe jurisdiction of the Propaganda is independent. The \"congregation\"\r\nof the college is composed of twenty-five cardinals, sixteen of whom\r\nare resident in Rome. One of their number is appointed prefect, and\r\nhas a prelate for his secretary. They meet statedly, once a month, for\r\nthe transaction of business, in a magnificent hall in the college.\r\nPrevious to 1851, the affairs of the Roman Catholic Church in England\r\nwere administered by the Propaganda; our country being included among\r\nheretical or heathen lands to which missionaries were sent. But after\r\nthat memorable year they were transferred to the ordinary\r\njurisdiction of the See of Rome. This movement was the first distinct\r\nact of papal aggression, and provoked fierce hostility among all\r\nclasses of the Protestant community. However some of us may regret\r\nthat such powerful and well-organised machinery is employed to\r\npropagate to the ends of the earth a faith to which we cannot\r\nsubscribe, yet no one can read the proud inscription upon the front of\r\nthe edifice, \"Collegio di Propagandâ Fide,\" and reflect upon the grand\r\nway in which the purpose therein defined has been carried out, without\r\na sentiment of admiration. At a time when Protestant Churches were\r\nselfishly devoted to their own narrow interests, and utterly unmindful\r\nof the Saviour's commission to preach the gospel to every creature,\r\nthis college was sending forth to different countries, only partially\r\nexplored, bands of young priests who carried their lives in their\r\nhands, and endured untold sufferings so that they might impart to the\r\nheathen the blessings of Christian civilisation. There is not a region\r\nfrom China and Japan to Mexico and the South Sea Islands, and from\r\nAfrica to Siberia, which has not been taken possession of by members\r\nof this college, and cultivated for the Church. Names that are as\r\nworthy of being canonised as those of any saint in the Roman calendar,\r\non account of their heroic achievements, their holy lives, or their\r\nmartyr deaths, belong to the rôle of the Propaganda. And while\r\nsedulously spreading their faith, they were at the same time adding to\r\nthe sum of human knowledge; many of the most valuable and important\r\ncontributions to ethnology, geography, philology, and natural science\r\nhaving been made by the students of this college. Pope Pius IX. in his\r\nearly days, after he had renounced his military career and become a\r\npriest, was sent out by the Propaganda, as secretary to a\r\npolitico-religious mission which Pius VII. organised and despatched to\r\nChili; and in that country his missionary career of two years\r\nexhibited all the devotion of a saint.\r\n\r\nI had the pleasure of going through the various rooms of this famous\r\ninstitution in the appropriate company of one of the most\r\ndistinguished Free Church missionaries in India; and was shown by the\r\nrector of the college, with the utmost courtesy and kindness, all that\r\nwas most remarkable about the place. The library is extensive, and\r\ncontains some rare works on theology and canon law; and in the Borgian\r\nMuseum annexed to it there is a rich collection of Oriental MSS.,\r\nheathen idols, and natural curiosities sent by missionaries from\r\nvarious parts of the world. We were especially struck with the\r\nmagnificent \"Codex Mexicanus,\" a loosely-bound, bulky MS. on white\r\nleather, found among the treasures of the royal palace at the conquest\r\nof Mexico by Cortes. It is full of coloured hieroglyphics and\r\npictures, and is known in this country through the splendid\r\nreproduction of Lord Kingsborough.\r\n\r\nBut the most interesting of all the sights to the visitor is the\r\nprinting establishment, which at one time was the first in the world,\r\nand had the means of publishing books in upwards of thirty different\r\nlanguages. At the present day it is furnished with all the recent\r\nappliances; and from this press has issued works distinguished as much\r\nfor their typographical beauty as for the area they cover in the\r\nmission field. Its font of Oriental types is specially rich. We were\r\nshown specimens of the Paternoster in all the known languages; and my\r\nfriend had an opportunity of inspecting some theological works in the\r\nobscure dialects of India. The productions of the Propaganda press are\r\nvery widely diffused. There is a bookseller's shop connected with the\r\nestablishment, where all the publications of the institution,\r\nincluding the papal bulls, and the principal documents of the State,\r\nmay be procured. Altogether the college has taken a prominent part in\r\nthe education of the world. Its influence is specially felt in\r\nAmerica, from which a large number of its students come; the young\r\npriest who conducted us through the library and the Borgian Museum\r\nbeing an American, very intelligent and affable. The Roman Catholic\r\nreligion flourishes in that country because it keeps clear of all\r\npolitical questions, and manifests itself, not as a government, in\r\nwhich character it is peculiarly uncompromising and despotic, but as a\r\nreligion, in which aspect it has a wonderful power of adaptation to\r\nthe habits and tastes of the people. The Propaganda rules Roman\r\nCatholic America very much in the spirit of its own institutions; and\r\none of the most remarkable social phenomena of that country is the\r\nabsolute subserviency which the political spirit of unbridled\r\ndemocracy yields to its decrees. The bees of the Barberini carved upon\r\nits architectural ornaments are no inapt symbol of the spirit and\r\nmethod of working of this busy theological hive, which sends its\r\nannual swarms all over the world to gather ecclesiastical honey from\r\nevery flower of opportunity.\r\n\r\nPassing beyond the Propaganda, we come to a lofty pillar of the\r\nCorinthian order, situated at the commencement of the Piazza di\r\nSpagna. It is composed of a kind of gray Carystian marble called\r\n_cipollino_, distinguished by veins of pale green rippling through it,\r\nlike the layers of a vegetable bulb, on account of which it is\r\npopularly known as the onion stone. It is one of the largest known\r\nmonoliths, being forty-two feet in height and nearly five feet in\r\ndiameter. It looks as fresh as though it were only yesterday carved\r\nout of the quarry; but it must be nearly two thousand years old,\r\nhaving been found about a hundred years ago when digging among the\r\nruins of the amphitheatre of Statilius Taurus, constructed in the\r\nreign of Cæsar Augustus on the site now called, from a corruption of\r\nthe old name, Monte Citorio, and occupied by the Houses of Parliament.\r\nWhen discovered the pillar was unfinished, a circumstance which would\r\nindicate that it had never been erected. It was left to Pope Pius IX.,\r\nafter all these centuries of neglect and obscurity, to find a use for\r\nit. Crowning its capital by a bronze statue of the Virgin Mary, and\r\ndisfiguring its shaft by a fantastic bronze network extending up\r\ntwo-fifths of its height, he erected it where it now stands in 1854,\r\nto commemorate the establishment by papal bull of the dogma of the\r\nImmaculate Conception. It was during his exile at Gaeta, at a time\r\nwhen Italy was torn with civil dissensions, and his own dominions were\r\nafflicted with the most grievous calamities, which he could have\r\neasily averted or remedied if he wished, that this dogma engrossed the\r\nmind of the holy father and his ecclesiastical court. The\r\nconstitutionalists at Rome were anxiously expecting some conciliatory\r\nmanifesto which should precede the Pope's return and restore peace and\r\nprosperity; and they were mortified beyond measure by receiving only\r\nthe letter in which this theological fiction was announced by his\r\nHoliness. The people cried for the bread of constitutional liberty,\r\nand the holy father gave them the stone of a religious dogma to which\r\nthey were wholly indifferent; thus demonstrating the incompatibility\r\nof the functions of a temporal and spiritual sovereign.\r\n\r\nThe pillar of the Immaculate Conception is embellished by statues of\r\nMoses, David, Isaiah, and Ezekiel, with texts from Scripture, and very\r\ninferior bronze bas-reliefs of the incidents connected with the\r\npublication of the dogma. As a work of art, it is heavy and graceless,\r\nwith hard mechanical lines; and the figure of the Virgin at the top is\r\nutterly destitute of merit. The whole monument is a characteristic\r\nspecimen of the modern Roman school of sculpture. For ages Rome has\r\nbeen considered the foster mother of art, and residence in it\r\nessential to the education of the art-faculty. But this is a delusion.\r\nIts atmosphere has never been really favourable to the development of\r\ngenius. There is a moral malaria of the place as fatal to the\r\nversatile life of the imagination as the physical miasma is to health.\r\nRoman Catholicism has petrified the heart and the fancy; and a petty\r\nround of ceremonies, feasts, and social parties dissipates energy and\r\ndistracts the powers of those who are not under the influence of the\r\nChurch. The decadence of art has kept pace with the growing corruption\r\nof religion. Descending from the purer spiritual conceptions of former\r\ntimes to grosser and more superstitious ideas, it has given outward\r\nexpression to these in baser forms. Even St. Peter's, though\r\nextravagantly praised by so many visitors, is but the visible\r\nembodiment of the vulgar splendour of later Catholicism. The pillar of\r\nthe Immaculate Conception is not only a monument of religious\r\nsuperstition, but also of what must strike every thoughtful observer\r\nin Rome--the decadence of art in modern times as compared with the\r\nglorious earlier days of a purer Church. And the art of the sculptor\r\nis only in keeping with that of the painter in connection with this\r\ndogma. For the large frescoes of Podesti, which occupy a conspicuous\r\nplace in the great hall of the Vatican, preceding the stanze of\r\nRaphael, and depict the persons and incidents connected with the\r\nproclamation of the Immaculate Conception, are worthless as works of\r\nart, and present a melancholy contrast to the works of the immortal\r\ngenius in the adjoining halls, who wrought under the inspiration of a\r\nnobler faith. No Titian or Raphael, no Michael Angelo or Bramante, was\r\nfound in the degenerate days of Pio Nono to immortalise what he called\r\nthe greatest event of his reign.\r\n\r\nThe square in which the pillar of the Immaculate Conception is\r\nsituated, along with the surrounding streets, is called the \"Ghetto\r\nInglese,\" for here the English and Americans most do congregate. At\r\nalmost every step one encounters the fresh open countenances, blue\r\neyes, and fair hair, which one is accustomed to associate with darker\r\nskies and ruder buildings. The Piazza di Spagna, so called from the\r\npalace of the Spanish ambassador situated in a corner of it, is one of\r\nthe finest squares of Rome, being paved throughout, and surrounded on\r\nevery side by lofty and picturesque buildings. In the centre is a\r\nquaint old boat-shaped fountain, called Fontana della Barcaccia, its\r\nbrown slippery sides being tinted with mosses, confervæ, and other\r\ngrowths of wet surfaces. It was designed by Bernini to commemorate the\r\nstranding of a boat on the spot after the retiring of the great flood\r\nof 1598, which overwhelmed most of Rome. On the site of the Piazza di\r\nSpagna, there was, in the days of Domitian, an artificial lake, on\r\nwhich naval battles took place, witnessed by immense audiences seated\r\nin a kind of amphitheatre on the borders of the lake. As an object of\r\ntaste the boat-shaped fountain is condemned by many; but Bernini\r\nadopted the form not only because of the associations of the spot, but\r\nalso because the head of water was not sufficient for a jet of any\r\nconsiderable height. Quaint, or even ugly, as some might call it, it\r\nwas to me an object of peculiar interest. Its water is of the purest\r\nand sweetest; and in the stillness of the hot noon its bright sparkle\r\nand dreamy murmur were delightfully refreshing. No city in the world\r\nis so abundantly supplied with water as Rome. You hear the lulling\r\nsound and see the bright gleam of water in almost every square. A\r\nriver falls in a series of sparkling cascades from the Fountain of\r\nTrevi and the Fontana Paolina into deep, immense basins; and even into\r\nthe marble sarcophagi of ancient kings, with their gracefully\r\nsculptured sides, telling some story of Arcadian times, whose nymphs\r\nand naiads are in beautiful harmony with the rustic murmur of the\r\nstream, is falling a gush of living water in many a palace courtyard.\r\nThis sound of many waters is, indeed, a luxury in such a climate; and\r\nsome of the pleasantest moments are those in which the visitor lingers\r\nbeside one of the fountains, when the blaze and bustle of the day are\r\nover, and the balmy softness of the evening produce a dreamy mood, to\r\nwhich the music of the waters is irresistibly fascinating.\r\n\r\nThe most distinguishing feature of the Piazza di Spagna is the wide\r\nstaircase which leads up from one side of it to the church of the\r\nTrinita dei Monti, with its twin towers, through whose belfry arches\r\nthe blue sky appears. This lofty staircase comprises one hundred and\r\nthirty steps, and the ascent is so gradual, and the landing-places so\r\nbroad and commodious, that it is quite a pleasure, even for the most\r\ninfirm persons, to mount it. The travertine of which it is composed is\r\npolished into the smoothness of marble by constant use. It is the\r\nfavourite haunt of all the painters' models; and there one meets at\r\ncertain hours of the day with beautiful peasant girls from the\r\nneighbouring mountains, in the picturesque costumes of the contadini,\r\nand old men with grizzled beards and locks, dressed in ragged cloaks,\r\nthe originals of many a saint and Madonna in some sacred pictures,\r\ntalking and laughing, or basking with half-shut eyes in the full glare\r\nof the sun. These models come usually from Cervaro and Saracinesco;\r\nthe latter an extraordinary Moorish town situated at a great height\r\namong the Sabine hills, whose inhabitants have preserved intact since\r\nthe middle ages their Arabic names and Oriental features and customs.\r\n\r\nOn this staircase used to congregate the largest number of the beggars\r\nof Rome, whose hideous deformities were made the excuse for extorting\r\nmoney from the soft-hearted forestieri. Happily this plague has now\r\ngreatly abated, and one may ascend or descend the magnificent stair\r\nwithout being revolted by the sight of human degradation, or\r\npersecuted by the importunate outcries of those who are lost to shame.\r\nThe Government has done a good thing in diminishing this frightful\r\nmendicancy. But it is to be feared that whilst there are many who beg\r\nwithout any necessity, sturdy knaves who are up to all kinds of petty\r\nlarceny, there are not a few who have no other means of livelihood,\r\nand without the alms of the charitable would die of starvation. The\r\nvisitor sees only the gay side of such a place as Rome; but there are\r\nmany tragedies behind the scenes. Centuries of misrule under the papal\r\ngovernment had pauperised the people; and the sudden transition to the\r\nnew state of things has deprived many of the old employments, without\r\nfurnishing any substitutes, while there is no longer the dole at the\r\nconvent door to provide for their wants. The whole social organisation\r\nof Italy, with its frequent saints' days, during which no work is\r\ndone, and its numerous holy fraternities living on alms, and its\r\nsanctification of mendicancy in the name of religion, has tended to\r\npauperise the nation, and give it those unthrifty improvident habits\r\nwhich have destroyed independence and self-respect. Although,\r\ntherefore, the Government has publicly forbidden begging throughout\r\nthe country, it has in some measure tacitly connived at it, as a\r\ncompromise between an inefficient poor-law and the widespread misery\r\narising from the improvidence of so many of its subjects; the amount\r\nof the harvest reaped by the beggars from the visitors to Rome being\r\nso much saved to the public purse. And though one does not meet so\r\nmany unscrupulous beggars as formerly in the main thoroughfares of\r\nRome, one is often annoyed by them on the steps of the churches, where\r\nthey seem to have the right of sanctuary, and to levy toll upon all\r\nfor whom they needlessly lift the heavy leathern curtain that hangs at\r\nthe door. We must remember that mendicancy is a very ancient\r\ninstitution in Italy, and that it will die hard, if it ever dies at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nThe church of the Trinita dei Monti, built in 1494 by Charles VIII. of\r\nFrance, occupies a most commanding position on the terrace above the\r\nSpanish Square, and is seen as a most conspicuous feature in all the\r\nviews of Rome from the neighbourhood. An Egyptian obelisk with\r\nhieroglyphics, of the age of the Ptolemies, which once adorned the\r\nso-called circus in the gardens of Sallust on the Quirinal, now\r\nelevated on a lofty pedestal, dedicated to the Holy Trinity, and\r\nsurmounted by a cross, stands in front of the church, and gives an air\r\nof antiquity to it which its own four hundred years could hardly\r\nimpart, as well as forms an appropriate termination to the splendid\r\nflight of steps which leads up to it. The church is celebrated for the\r\npossession of the \"Descent from the Cross,\" a fresco by Ricciarelli,\r\ncommonly known by the name of Daniel of Volterra, said to be one of\r\nthe three finest pictures in the world. But the chapel which it adorns\r\nis badly lighted, and the painting has been greatly injured by the\r\nFrench, who attempted to remove it in 1817. It does not produce a very\r\npleasing impression, being dark and oily-looking; and the cross-lights\r\nin the place interfere with the expression of the figures. We can\r\nrecognise much of the force and graphic power of Michael Angelo, whom\r\nthe painter sedulously imitated, in various parts of the composition;\r\nbut it seems to me greatly inferior as a whole to the better-known\r\npicture of Rubens. In another chapel of this church was interred the\r\ncelebrated painter Claude Lorraine, who lived for many years in a\r\nhouse not far off; but the French transferred the remains of their\r\ncountryman to the monument raised to him in their native church in the\r\nVia della Scrofa.\r\n\r\nAdjoining the church is the convent of the Sacred Heart, which\r\nformerly belonged to French monks, minims of the order of St. Francis.\r\nIt suffered severely from the wantonness of the French soldiers who\r\nwere quartered in it during the French occupation of Rome in the first\r\nRevolution. Since 1827 the Convent has been in possession of French\r\nnuns, who are all ladies of rank. They each endow the Convent at their\r\ninitiation with a dowry of £1000; the rest of their property going to\r\ntheir nearest relatives as if they were dead. They spend their time in\r\ndevotional exercises, in superintending the education of a number of\r\nyoung girls in the higher branches, and in giving advice to those who\r\nare allowed to visit them for this purpose every afternoon. The\r\nTrinita dei Monti is the only church in Rome where female voices are\r\nto be heard chanting the religious services; and on account of this\r\npeculiarity, and the fresh sweet voices of the nuns and their pupils,\r\nmany people flock to hear them singing the Ave Maria at sunset, on\r\nSundays and on great festivals, the singers themselves being\r\ninvisible behind a curtain in the organ gallery. Mendelssohn found\r\ntheir vespers charming, though his critical ear detected many\r\nblemishes in the playing and singing. I visited the church one day. As\r\nit is shut after matins, I was admitted at a side door by one of the\r\nnuns, who previously inspected me through the wicket, and was left\r\nalone, the door being locked behind me. The interior is severely\r\nsimple and grand, preserving the original pointed architecture\r\ninclining to Gothic, and is exquisitely clean and white, as women\r\nalone could keep it; in this respect forming a remarkable contrast to\r\nthe grand but dirty church of the Capuchin monks. I had ample leisure\r\nto study the very interesting pictures in the chapels. The solitude\r\nwas only disturbed by a kneeling figure in black, motionless as a\r\nstatue behind the iron railing in front of the high altar, or by the\r\noccasional presence of a nun, who moved across the transept with slow\r\nand measured steps, her face hid by a long white veil which gave her a\r\nspirit-like appearance. In the heart of one of the busiest parts of\r\nthe city, no mountain cloister could be more quiet and lonely. One\r\nfelt the soothing stillness, lifted above the world, while yet\r\nretaining the closest connection with it. It is sweet to leave the\r\nbusy crowd of various nationalities below, intent only upon pleasure,\r\nand, climbing up the lofty staircase, enter this secluded shrine, and\r\nbe alone with God.\r\n\r\nIn the Piazza di Spagna some shops are always open on Sundays,\r\nespecially those which minister to the wants and luxuries of\r\nstrangers. Rows of cabs are ranged in the centre, waiting to be hired,\r\nand groups of flower-sellers stand near the shops, who thrust their\r\nbeautiful bouquets almost into the face of every passer-by. If Rome is\r\ncelebrated for its fountains, it is equally celebrated for its\r\nflowers. Whether it is owing to the soil, or the climate, or the mode\r\nof cultivation, or all combined, certain it is that nowhere else does\r\none see flowers of such brilliant colours, perfect forms, and\r\ndelicious fragrance; and the quantities as well as varieties of them\r\nare perfectly wonderful. Delicate pink and straw-coloured tea-roses,\r\ncamellias, and jonquils mingled their high-born beauties with the more\r\nhomely charms of wild-flowers that grew under the shadow of the great\r\nsolemn stone-pines on the heights around, or twined their fresh\r\ngarlands over the sad ruins of the Campagna. In the hand of every\r\nlittle boy and girl were bunches for sale of wild cyclamens, blue\r\nanemones, and sweet-scented violets, surrounded by their own leaves,\r\nand neatly tied up with thread. They had been gathered in the princely\r\ngrounds of the Doria Pamphili and Borghese villas in the neighbourhood\r\nof Rome, which are freely opened to all, and where for many days in\r\nFebruary and March groups of men, women, and children may be seen\r\ngathering vast quantities of those first-born children of the sun. The\r\nviolets, especially in these grounds, are abundant and luxuriant,\r\nmaking every space of sward shadowed by the trees purple with their\r\nloveliness, like a reflection of the violet sky that had broken in\r\nthrough the lattice-work of boughs, and scenting all the air with\r\ntheir delicious perfume. They brought into the hot hard streets the\r\nwitchery of the woodlands; and no one could inhale for a moment, in\r\npassing by, the sweet wafture of their fragrance without being\r\ntransported in imagination to far-off scenes endeared to memory, and\r\nwithout a thrill of nameless tenderness at the heart. Some of the\r\nbunches of violets I was asked to buy were of a much paler purple than\r\nthe others, and I was at no loss to explain this peculiarity. The\r\nplants with the deep violet petals and dark crimson eye had single\r\nblossoms, whereas those whose petals were lilac, and whose eye was of\r\na paler red colour, were double. Cultivation had increased the number\r\nof petals, but it had diminished the richness of the colouring. This\r\nis an interesting example of the impartial balancing of nature. No\r\nobject possesses every endowment. Defect in one direction is made up\r\nby excess in another. The rose pays for its mass of beautiful petals\r\nby its sterility; and the single violet has a lovelier hue, and is\r\nperfectly fertile, whereas the double one is pale and cannot\r\nperpetuate itself. And the moral lesson of this parable of nature is\r\nnot difficult to read. Leanness of soul often accompanies the\r\nfulfilment of our earthly desires; and outward abundance often\r\nproduces selfishness and covetousness. The peculiar evil of prosperity\r\nis discontent, dissatisfaction with present gain and a longing for\r\nmore, and a spirit of repining at the little ills and disappointments\r\nof life. Humble, fragrant, useful contentment belongs to the soul that\r\nhas the single eye, and \"the one thing needful;\" and the more we seek\r\nto double our possessions and enjoyments in the spirit of selfishness,\r\nthe less beautiful and fragrant are we in the sight of God and man,\r\nand the less good we do in the world.\r\n\r\nFrom the Piazza di Spagna I passed onward through a long street called\r\nthe Via Babuino, from an antique statue of a satyr mutilated into the\r\nlikeness of a baboon, that used to adorn a fountain about the middle\r\nof it, now removed. More business is done on Sunday in this street\r\nthan in any other quarter, with the exception of the Corso. Here a\r\nshop full of bright and beautiful flowers, roses, magnolias,\r\nhyacinths, and lilies of the valley, perfumed all the air; there a\r\njeweller's shop displayed its tempting imitations of Etruscan\r\nornaments, and beads of Roman pearls, coral, lapis lazuli, and\r\nmalachite; while yonder a marble-cutter wrought diligently at his\r\nlaths, converting some fragment of rare marble--picked up by a tourist\r\namong the ruins of ancient Rome--into a cup or letter-weight to be\r\ncarried home as a souvenir.\r\n\r\nThe Via Babuino opens upon the Piazza del Popolo, the finest and\r\nlargest square in Rome. In the centre is a magnificent Egyptian\r\nobelisk of red Syene granite, about eighty feet in height, carved with\r\nhieroglyphics, with four marble Egyptian lions at each corner of the\r\nplatform upon which it stands, pouring from their mouths copious\r\nstreams of water into large basins, with a refreshing sound. Perhaps\r\nthe eyes of Abraham rested upon this obelisk when he went down into\r\nEgypt, the first recorded traveller who visited the valley of the\r\nNile; and the familiarity of the sight to the Israelites during their\r\nbondage in the neighbourhood may have suggested the wonderful vision\r\nof the pillar of cloud by day and of fire by night which regulated\r\ntheir wanderings in the wilderness. God does not paint His revelations\r\non the empty air, but weaves them into the web of history, or pours\r\nthem into the mould of common earthly objects and ordinary human\r\nexperiences. Many of the rites and institutions of the Mosaic economy\r\nwere borrowed from those of the Egyptian priesthood; the tabernacle\r\nand its furniture were composed of the gold and jewels of which the\r\nIsraelites had spoiled the Egyptians; and its form, a tent moved from\r\nplace to place, accommodated itself to the wandering camp-life of the\r\nIsraelites. It is not unreasonable, therefore, to suppose that He who\r\nappeared to Moses at Horeb, not in some unknown supernatural blaze of\r\nglory altogether detached from earth, but in the common fire of a\r\nshepherd in the common dry vegetation of the desert, and who made use\r\nof the common shepherd's rod which Moses carried in his hand to\r\nperform the wonderful miracles before Pharaoh, would also make use of\r\nthe obelisk of Heliopolis, one of the most familiar objects which met\r\ntheir eye during their captivity, as the pattern of the Shechinah\r\ncloud which guided His people in their journey to the land of Canaan.\r\nThe symbol of the sun that shone upon their weary toil as slaves in\r\nthe clay-pits beside the Nile, now protected and illumined them in\r\ntheir march as freemen through the desert. What they had probably\r\njoined their oppressors in worshipping as an idol, they now beheld\r\nwith awe and reverence as the token of the overshadowing and\r\novershining presence of the living and true God. That flame-shaped\r\nobelisk was the link between Egypt and the Holy Land. The divine\r\neffigy of it in the sky of the desert--like the manna as the link\r\nbetween the corn of Egypt and the corn of Canaan--marked the\r\ntransition from the false to the true, from the old world of dark\r\npagan thought, to the new world of religious light. I need not say\r\nwith what profound interest such a thought invested the obelisk in the\r\nPiazza del Popolo. I was never weary of looking up at its fair\r\nproportions, and trying to decipher its strange hieroglyphics--figures\r\nof birds and beasts in intaglio, cut clear and deep into the hard\r\ngranite, and all as bright in colour and carving as though it had been\r\nonly yesterday cut out of the quarry instead of four thousand years\r\nago. It was my first glimpse into the mysterious East. It made the\r\nwonderful story of Joseph and Moses not a mere narrative in a book,\r\nbut a living reality standing out from the far past like a view in a\r\nstereoscope. Every time I passed it--and I did so at all hours--I\r\npaused to enter into this reverie of the olden time. The daylight\r\nchanged it into a pillar of cloud, casting the shadow of the great\r\nthoughts connected with it over my mind; the moonlight shining upon\r\nits rosy hue changed it into a pillar of fire, illumining all the\r\ninner chambers of my soul. Every Sunday it was the cynosure guiding me\r\non my way to church, and suggesting thoughts and memories in unison\r\nwith the character of the day and the nature of my work. No other\r\nobject in Rome remains so indelibly pictured in my mind.\r\n\r\nFrom the Piazza del Popolo, three long narrow streets run, like three\r\nfingers from the palm of the hand; the Via Babuino, which leads to the\r\nEnglish quarter; the famous Corso, which leads to the Capitol and the\r\nForum; and the Ripetta, which leads to St. Peter's and the Vatican.\r\nThese approaches are guarded by two churches, S. Maria di Monte Santo\r\nand S. Maria dei Miracoli, similar in appearance, with oval domes and\r\ntetrastyle porticoes that look like ecclesiastical porters' lodges.\r\nThe name of the Piazza del Popolo is derived, not from the people, as\r\nis generally supposed, but from the extensive grove of poplar-trees\r\nthat surrounded the Mausoleum of Augustus, and long formed the most\r\nconspicuous feature in the neighbourhood. The crescent-shaped sides of\r\nthe square are bounded on the left by a wall, with a bright fountain\r\nand appropriate statuary in the middle of it, and a fringe of tall\r\ncypress-trees, and on the right by a similar wall, adorned with marble\r\ntrophies and two columns rough with the projecting prows of ships\r\ntaken from the ancient temple of Venice and Rome, and rising in a\r\nseries of terraced walks to the upper platform of the Pincio. At the\r\nfoot of this _Collis Hortulorum_, \"Hill of Gardens,\" which was a\r\nfavourite resort of the ancient Romans, Nero was buried; and in\r\nearlier republican times it was the site of the famous Villa of\r\nLucullus, who had accumulated an enormous fortune when general of the\r\nRoman army in Asia, and spent it on his retirement from active life in\r\nthe most sumptuous entertainments and the most prodigal luxuries. Here\r\nhe gave his celebrated feast to Cicero and Pompey. From Lucullus, the\r\nmagnificent grounds passed into the possession of Valerius Asiaticus;\r\nand while his property they became the scene of a tragedy which\r\nreminds one of the story of Ahab and Jezebel and the vineyard of\r\nNaboth. The infamous Messalina, the wife of the Emperor Claudius,\r\ncoveted the grounds of Asiaticus. With the unscrupulous spirit of\r\nJezebel, she procured the condemnation to death of the owner for\r\ncrimes that he had never committed; a fate which he avoided by\r\ncommitting suicide. As soon as this obstacle was removed out of her\r\nway, she appropriated the villa; and in the beautiful grounds\r\nabandoned herself to the most shameless orgies in the absence of her\r\nhusband at Ostia. But her pleasure and triumph were short-lived. The\r\nemperor was informed of her enormities, and hastened home to take\r\nvengeance. Having vainly tried all means of conciliation, and\r\nattempted without effect to kill herself, she was slain in a paroxysm\r\nof terror and anguish, by a blow of the executioner's falchion; and\r\nthe death of Asiaticus was avenged on the very spot where it\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\nThe gardens of the Pincio are small, but a fairer spot it would be\r\nhard to find anywhere. The grounds are most beautifully laid out, and\r\nso skilfully arranged that they seem of far larger extent than they\r\nreally are. Splendid palm-trees, aloes, and cactuses give a tropical\r\ncharm to the walks; rare exotics and bloom-laden trees of genial\r\nclimes, flashing fountains, and all manner of cultivated beauty,\r\nenliven the scene; while the air blows fresh and invigorating from the\r\ndistant hills. From the lofty parapet of the city-wall which bounds it\r\non one side, you gaze into the green meadows and rich wooded solitudes\r\nof the Borghese grounds, that look like some rural retreat a score of\r\nmiles from the city; and from the stone balustrade on the other side\r\nyou see all Rome at your feet with its sea of brown houses, and beyond\r\nthe picturesque roofs and the hidden river rising up the great mass of\r\nthe Vatican buildings and the mighty dome of St. Peter's, which\r\ncatches like a mountain peak the last level gold of the sunset, and\r\nflashes it back like an illumination, while all the intermediate view\r\nis in shadow. No wonder that the Pincian Hill is the favourite\r\npromenade of Rome, and that on week-days and Sunday afternoons you see\r\nmultitudes of people showing every phase of Roman life, and hundreds\r\nof carriages containing the flower of the Roman aristocracy, with\r\nbeautiful horses, and footmen in rich liveries, crowding the piazza\r\nbelow, ascending the winding road, and driving or walking round\r\nbetween the palms and the pines, over the garden-paths, to the sound\r\nof band music. And thus they continue to amuse themselves till the sun\r\nhas set, and the first sound of the bells of Ave Maria is heard from\r\nthe churches; and then they wind their way homewards.\r\n\r\nWe pass out from the Piazza through the Porta del Popolo, the only way\r\nby which strangers used to approach Rome from the north. It was indeed\r\na more suitable entrance into the Eternal City than the present one;\r\nfor no human being, with a spark of imagination, would care to obtain\r\nhis first view of the city of his dreams from the outside of a great\r\nbustling railway station. But the Porta del Popolo had annoyances of\r\nits own that seemed hardly less incongruous. One had to run the\r\ngauntlet of the custom-house here, and to practise unheard-of\r\nbriberies upon the venal douaniers of the Pope before being allowed to\r\npass on to his hotel. And the first glimpse of the city from this\r\npoint did not come up to one's expectations, being very much like that\r\nof any commonplace modern capital, without a ruin visible, or any sign\r\nor suggestion of the mistress of the world. The Porta del Popolo\r\nalmost marks the position of the old Flaminian gate, through which\r\npassed the great northern road of Italy, constructed by the Roman\r\ncensor, C. Flaminius, two hundred and twenty years before Christ,\r\nextending as far as Rimini, a distance of two hundred and ten miles.\r\nThrough that old gate, and along that old road, the Roman cohorts\r\npassed to conquer Britain, then a small isle inhabited by savage\r\ntribes. Hardly any path save that to Jerusalem has been trodden by so\r\nmany human feet as this old Flaminian road. The present gate is said\r\nto have been designed by Michael Angelo; but it shows no signs of his\r\ngenius. On the inner side, above the keystone of the arch, is a lofty\r\nbrick wall in the shape of a horse-shoe, built exclusively for the\r\npurpose of displaying in colossal size, emblazoned in stucco, the city\r\narms, the sun rising above three or four pyramidal mountains arranged\r\nabove each other. The external façade consists of two pairs of Doric\r\ncolumns of granite and marble flanking the arch, whose colour and\r\nbeauty have entirely disappeared through exposure to the weather. In\r\nthe spaces between the columns are two statues, one of St. Peter, and\r\nthe other of St. Paul, of inferior merit, and very much stained and\r\nweather-worn. The inscription above the arch, \"To a happy and\r\nprosperous entrance,\" seemed a mockery in the old douanier days, when\r\ndelays and extortions vexed the soul of the visitor, and produced a\r\nmood anything but favourable to the enjoyment of the Eternal City. But\r\nnow the grievances are over. The occupation of the place is gone. The\r\nbarracks on the left for the papal guards are converted to other\r\npurposes; no custom-house officer now meets one at the gate, and all\r\nare free to come and go without passport, or bribe, or hindrance.\r\nSince I was in Rome this old gateway being found too narrow has been\r\nconsiderably widened by the addition of a wing on each side of the\r\nlarge central arch, containing each a smaller arch in which the same\r\nstyle of architecture is carried out.\r\n\r\nOn the right as you go out is the remarkable church of Santa Maria del\r\nPopolo. It is built in the usual Romanesque style; but its external\r\nappearance is very unpretending, and owing to its situation in a\r\ncorner overshadowed by the wall it is apt to be overlooked. It is an\r\nold fabric, eight hundred years having passed away since Pope Paschal\r\nII. founded it on the spot where Nero was said to have been buried.\r\nFrom the tomb of the infamous tyrant grew a gigantic walnut-tree, the\r\nroosting-place of innumerable crows, supposed to be demons that\r\nhaunted the evil place. The erection of the church completely\r\nexorcised these foul spirits, consecrated the locality, and dispelled\r\nthe superstitious fears of the people. Reconstructed in the reign of\r\nSixtus IV., about the year 1480, this church has not the picturesque\r\nantiquity in this dry climate and clear atmosphere which our Gothic\r\nchurches in moist England present. Not more widely did the external\r\naspect of the tabernacle in the wilderness, with its dark goat-skin\r\ncoverings, differ from the interior of the Holy of holies, with its\r\ngolden furniture, than does the commonplace look of the outside of the\r\nchurch of Santa Maria del Popolo differ from its magnificent interior.\r\nIt is a perfect museum of sculpture and painting. Splendid tombs of\r\neminent cardinals of the best period of the Renaissance, rare marbles\r\nand precious stones in lavish profusion adorn the altars and walls of\r\nthe chapels; while they are further enriched by beautiful frescoes of\r\nsacred subjects from the pencils of Penturicchio and Annibale Caracci.\r\nAbove the high altar is an ancient picture of the Madonna, with an\r\nexceedingly swarthy eastern complexion, which is one among several\r\nothers in Rome attributed to the pencil of St. Luke the Evangelist,\r\nand which is supposed to possess the power of working miracles. One\r\nespecially magnificent chapel arrests the attention, and leaves a\r\nlasting impression--that of the Chigi family, built by Fabio Chigi,\r\nbetter known as Pope Alexander VII. The architecture was planned by\r\nRaphael. The design of the strange fresco on the ceiling of the dome,\r\nrepresenting the creation of the heavenly bodies, was sketched by him;\r\nand he modelled the beautiful statue of Jonah, sitting upon a\r\nwhale--said to have been carved from a block that fell from one of the\r\ntemples in the Forum--and sculptured the figure of Elijah, which are\r\namong the most conspicuous ornaments of the chapel. This is the only\r\nplace in which Raphael appears in the character of an architect and\r\nsculptor. Like Michael Angelo, the genius of this wonderfully-gifted\r\nartist was capable of varied expression; and it seemed a mere accident\r\nwhether his ideals were represented in stone, or colour, or words. On\r\nhis single head God seemed to have poured all His gifts; beauty of\r\nperson, and beauty of soul, and the power to perceive and embody the\r\nbeauty and the wonder of the world; the eye of light and the heart of\r\nfire; \"the angel nature in the angel name.\" And yet amid his fadeless\r\nart he faded away; and at the deathless shrines which he left behind\r\nthe admirer of his genius is left to lament his early death.\r\n\r\nSuch thoughts receive a still more mournful hue from a touching\r\ntomb--touching even though its taste be execrable--which records a\r\nhusband's sorrow on account of the death of his young wife--a princess\r\nof both the distinguished houses of Chigi and Odescalchi--who passed\r\naway at the age of twenty, in the saddest of all ways--in childbirth.\r\nIt goes to one's heart to think of the desolate home and the bereaved\r\nhusband left, as he says, \"in solitude and grief.\" And though the\r\nweeper has gone with the wept, and the sore wound which death\r\ninflicted has been healed by his own hand nearly a hundred years ago,\r\nwe feel a wondrous sympathy with that old domestic tragedy. It is a\r\ntouch of nature that affects one more than all the blazonry and\r\nsculpture around. In this weird church of Santa Maria del Popolo,\r\nwhich seems more a mausoleum of the dead than a place of worship for\r\nthe living, the level rays of the afternoon sun come through the\r\nrichly-painted windows of the choir; and the warm glory rests first\r\nupon a strange monument of the sixteenth century at the entrance,\r\nwhere a ghastly human skeleton sculptured in yellow marble looks\r\nthrough a grating, and then upon a medallion on a tomb, representing a\r\nbutterfly emerging from the chrysalis, illumining the inscription, \"Ut\r\nPhoenix multicabo dies.\" And this old expressive symbol speaks to us\r\nof death as the Christian's true birth, in which the spirit bursts its\r\nearthly shell, and soars on immortal wings to God. And the church\r\nstraightway to the inner eye becomes full of a transfiguration glory\r\nwhich no darkness of the tomb can quench, and which makes all earthly\r\nlove immortal.\r\n\r\nA venerable monastery, tenanted by monks of the order of St.\r\nAugustine, is attached to this church, upon whose brown-tiled roofs,\r\ncovered with gray and yellow lichens, and walls and windows of extreme\r\nsimplicity, the eye of the visitor gazes with deepest interest. For\r\nthis was the residence of Luther during his famous visit to Rome. He\r\ncame to this place in the fervour of youthful enthusiasm; his heart\r\nwas filled with pious emotions. He knelt down on the pavement when he\r\npassed through the Porta del Popolo, and cried, \"I salute thee, O holy\r\nRome; Rome venerable through the blood and the tombs of the martyrs!\"\r\nImmediately on his arrival he went to the convent of his own order,\r\nand celebrated mass with feelings of great excitement. But, alas! he\r\nwas soon to be disenchanted. He had not been many days in Rome when he\r\nsaw that the city of the saints and martyrs was wholly given up to\r\nidolatry and social corruption, and was as different as possible from\r\nthe city of his dreams. He cared not for the fine arts which covered\r\nthis pollution with a deceitful iridescence of refinement; and the\r\nruins of pagan Rome had no power to move his heart, preoccupied as it\r\nwas with horror at the monstrous wickedness which made desolate the\r\nvery sanctuary of God. When he ascended on his knees the famous Scala\r\nSanta, the holy staircase near the Lateran Palace--supposed to have\r\nbelonged to Pilate's house in Jerusalem, down whose marble steps our\r\nSaviour walked, wearing the crown of thorns and the emblems of mock\r\nroyalty which the soldiers had put upon him--he seemed to hear a voice\r\nwhispering to him the words, \"The just shall live by faith.\" Instantly\r\nthe scales fell from his eyes, and he saw the miserable folly of the\r\nwhole proceeding; and like a man suddenly freed from fetters, he rose\r\nfrom his knees, and walked firm and erect to the foot of the stairs.\r\nHe could not remain another day in the city. Returning to his\r\nmonastery, he there celebrated mass for the last time, and departed on\r\nthe morrow with the bitter words, \"Adieu, O city, where everything is\r\npermitted but to be a good man!\" Ten years later he burnt the Bull of\r\nthe Pope in the public square of Wittemberg, and all Europe rang with\r\nthe tocsin of the Reformation. I never passed that venerable monastery\r\nwithout thinking of the austere German monk and his glorious work; and\r\nthe old well-known motto of the Reformation which had been his\r\nbattle-cry in many a good fight of faith received new power and\r\nmeaning from the associations of the place. To the enlightenment\r\nreceived there, paving the way for religious and political liberty\r\nthroughout Christendom, I owed the privilege of preaching in Rome.\r\n\r\nThe Presbyterian church--I speak of the past, for since my visit the\r\nchurch has been removed to a more suitable site within the walls--is\r\na little distance farther on, on the opposite side of the street. You\r\nenter by a gateway, and find yourself in an open space surrounded with\r\nluxuriant hedges in full bloom, and large flowering shrubs, and\r\ncommanding a fine view of Monte Mario and the open country in that\r\ndirection, including the meadows where the noble Arnold of Brescia was\r\nburnt to death, and his ashes cast into the Tiber. The church is a\r\nsquare, flat-roofed eastern-looking building, in the inside tastefully\r\npainted in imitation of panels of Cipollino marble; and on the neat\r\npulpit is carved the symbol of the Scotch Church, the burning bush and\r\nits motto, nowhere surely more appropriate than in the place where the\r\nChristian faith has been subjected to the flames of pagan and papal\r\npersecution for eighteen hundred years, and has emerged purer and\r\nstronger. In that simple church I had the privilege of preaching to a\r\nlarge but fluctuating congregation, each day differently composed of\r\npersons belonging to various nationalities and denominations, but\r\nunited by one common bond of faith and love. At stated intervals we\r\ncelebrated together the touching feast that commemorates our Saviour's\r\ndying love, and the oneness of Christians in Him. The wonderful\r\nassociations of the place lent to such occasions a special interest\r\nand solemnity. Surrounded by the ruins of man's glory, we felt deeply\r\nhow unchanging was the word of God. In a city of gorgeous ceremonials\r\nthat had changed Christianity into a kind of baptized paganism, we\r\nfelt it indescribably refreshing to partake, in the beautiful\r\nsimplicity of our own worship, of the symbols of the broken body and\r\nshed blood of our Lord. We seemed to be compassed about with a great\r\ncloud of witnesses, apostles, martyrs, and saints, who in the early\r\nages of the Church in this city overcame the world by the blood of the\r\nLamb, and by the word of their testimony, and loved not their lives\r\nunto the death. More vividly than anywhere else, we seemed in this\r\nplace to come to the general assembly and church of the first-born,\r\nwhich are written in heaven, and to the spirits of just men made\r\nperfect, and to realise that we were built upon the foundation of the\r\napostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief\r\ncornerstone.\r\n\r\nOn the opposite side of the road is the classic portico that leads to\r\nthe Borghese Villa. The gate is almost always open; and every person\r\nis free to wander at will through the magnificent grounds, upwards of\r\nthree miles in circuit, and hold picnics in the sunny glades, and pull\r\nthe wild flowers that star the grass in myriads. On Sunday afternoons\r\nmultitudes come and go, and a long line of carriages, filled with the\r\nRoman nobility and with foreign visitors, in almost endless\r\nsuccession, make the circuit of the drives. The Porta del Popolo\r\nbecomes too strait for the seething mass of carriages and human beings\r\nthat pass through it; and it is with difficulty, and some danger to\r\nlife and limb, that one can force a passage through the gay\r\npleasure-loving crowd. At the Carnival time the ordinary dangers and\r\ndifficulties are increased tenfold; and the scene presents anything\r\nbut a Sabbath-like appearance. Nor are the danger and difficulty over\r\nwhen the gate is passed; for the Piazza del Popolo and the streets\r\nthat lead from it are crowded with carriages and pedestrians going to\r\nor returning from the favourite promenade on the Pincian Hill. One\r\nruns the gauntlet all the way; meditation is impossible; and the\r\nreturn from church in the afternoon is as different as possible from\r\nthe morning walk to it. What pleasure can these people derive from the\r\nbeautiful walks and drives in the Borghese grounds, except perhaps\r\nthat of seeing and being seen in a crowd? There is no seclusion of\r\nnature, no opportunity of quiet thought.\r\n\r\nOn week-days, at certain hours, one may enjoy the place thoroughly\r\nwithout any distraction, and feel amid the lonely vistas of the woods\r\nas if buried in the loneliest solitude of the Apennines. And truly on\r\nsuch occasions I know no place so fascinating, so like an earthly\r\nEden! The whole scene thrills one like lovely music. All the charms\r\nof nature and art are there focussed in brightest perfection. The\r\ngrounds are gay with starry anemones, and billowy acacias crested with\r\nodorous wreaths of yellow foam, dark and mysterious with tall ilexes,\r\ncypresses, and stone-pines, enlivened by graceful palms and tender\r\ndeciduous trees, musical with falling and glancing waters, and haunted\r\nby the statues of Greek divinities that filled men's minds with\r\nimmortal thoughts in the youth of the world--dimly visible amid the\r\nrecesses of the foliage. The path leads to a casino in which sculpture\r\nand painting have done their utmost to enrich and adorn the\r\napartments. But the result of all this prodigal display of wealth and\r\nrefinement is exceedingly melancholy. It would be death to inhabit\r\nthese sumptuous marble rooms when their coolness would be most\r\nagreeable; and the witchery of the shadowy wood paths and bowers in\r\ntheir summer perfection can be enjoyed only at the risk of catching\r\nfever. Man has made a paradise for himself, but the malaria drives him\r\nout of it, and all its costly beauty is almost thrown away. Only\r\nduring the desolation of winter, or the fair promise and\r\nhalf-developments of spring, can one wander safely through the place.\r\nThe sting of the serpent is in this Eden. Cursed is the ground for\r\nman's sake in the fairest scene that his industry, and genius, and\r\nvirtue can make for himself; but cursed with a double curse is the\r\nground that he makes a wilderness by his selfishness and wickedness.\r\nAnd this double curse, this fatal Circean spell, has come upon these\r\nbeautiful grounds in common with all the neighbourhood of Rome because\r\nof ages of human waste and wrong-doing. How striking a picture do they\r\npresent of all earth's beauties and possessions, which promise what\r\nthey cannot fully accomplish, which give no rest for the head or home\r\nfor the heart, and in which, when disposed to place our trust, we hear\r\never and anon the warning cry, \"Arise and depart, for this is not your\r\nrest, for it is polluted, for it will destroy you with a sore\r\ndestruction.\" And not without significance is the circumstance that\r\nsuch a lesson on the vanity of all earthly things should be suggested\r\nby what one sees over against the house of prayer. It illustrates and\r\nemphasises the precept which bids the worshipper set his affections on\r\nthings above, so that the house of God may become to him the very gate\r\nof heaven.\r\n\r\nFrom the entrance of the church, through a long suburb, you trace the\r\nold Flaminian road till it crosses the Tiber at the Ponte Molle, the\r\nfamous Milvian Bridge. It is strange to think of this hoary road of\r\nmany memories being now laid down with modern tramway rails, along\r\nwhich cars like those in any of our great manufacturing towns\r\ncontinually run. This is one of the many striking instances in which\r\nthe past and the present are incongruously united in Rome. You see on\r\nthe right side of the road a picturesque ridge of cliffs clothed with\r\nshaggy ilexes and underwood, overhanging at intervals the walls and\r\nbuildings. It was formed by lava ejected from some ancient volcano in\r\nthe neighbourhood; and over it was deposited, by the action of\r\nacidulated waters rising through the volcanic rock, a stratum of\r\ntravertine or fresh-water limestone. Not far off is a mineral spring\r\ncalled Acqua Acetosa, much frequented by the inhabitants on summer\r\nmornings, which may be considered one of the expiring efforts of\r\nvolcanic action in the neighbourhood. The Milvian Bridge is associated\r\nwith most interesting and important historical events. The Roman\r\ncitizens, two hundred years before Christ, met here the messengers who\r\nannounced the defeat of Asdrubal on the Metaurus at the end of the\r\nsecond Punic war. Here the ambassadors of the Allobroges implicated in\r\nCatiline's conspiracy were arrested by order of Cicero. And from the\r\nparapets of the bridge the body of Maxentius, the rival pagan emperor,\r\nwas hurled into the Tiber, after his defeat by Constantine in the\r\ngreat battle of Saxa Rubra, which took place a little distance off.\r\nVisitors to the Vatican will remember the spirited representation of\r\nthis battle on the walls of Raphael's Stanze, designed by the\r\nimmortal master, and executed by Giulio Romano, the largest historical\r\nsubject ever painted. By the tragic details of this battle, men and\r\nhorses being entangled in the eddies of the river, the Christians were\r\nreminded of the destruction of Pharaoh and his host in the Red Sea,\r\nand the consequent deliverance of Israel. The victory on the side of\r\nConstantine led to the total overthrow of paganism, and put an end to\r\nthe age of religious persecution. On this memorable day the\r\nseven-branched golden candlestick which Titus had taken from the\r\ntemple of Jerusalem, according to tradition, was thrown into the\r\nTiber, where it lies under a vast accumulation of mud in the bed of\r\nthe river. It would thus seem as if the Jewish religion, too, of which\r\nthe golden candlestick was the most expressive symbol, had come\r\nfinally to an end in this triumph of Christianity. Of the monuments by\r\nwhich the great battle was commemorated one still survives near the\r\nColosseum, the well-known triumphal arch of Constantine, which is at\r\nonce a satire upon the decay of art at the time, and the halting of\r\nthe new emperor between the two religions, containing, as it does,\r\npagan figures and inscriptions mixed up incongruously with Christian\r\nones.\r\n\r\nWe gaze with deep interest upon the serene violet sky which broods\r\nover the Milvian Bridge, and which still seems to the fancy to glow\r\nwith the consciousness of the ancient legend, when we remember that it\r\nwas in that sky, while on his march to the battle, Constantine saw,\r\nsurmounting and outshining the noonday sun, the wondrous vision of the\r\nflaming cross, with the words \"In this conquer,\" which assured him not\r\nonly of victory in the approaching engagement, but of the subsequent\r\nuniversal ascendancy of Christianity throughout the world. This\r\nvision, which in all probability was only a parhelion, exaggerated by\r\na superstitious and excited imagination, produced a crisis in the life\r\nof Constantine. He adopted the Christian faith immediately\r\nafterwards, and introduced the cross as the standard of his army; and\r\nin the faith of the visionary cross he marched from victory to\r\nvictory, until at last he reigned alone as head of the Church and\r\nEmperor of the world, and brought about relations between Church and\r\nState which seemed to the historian Eusebius to be no less than the\r\nfulfilment of the apocalyptic vision of the New Jerusalem. Beyond this\r\nscene stretches to the faint far-off horizon the desert Campagna; a\r\ndim, misty, homeless land, where the moan of the wind sounds ever like\r\nthe voice of the past, and the pathos of a vanished people breathes\r\nover all the scene; with here and there a gray nameless ruin, a\r\ndesolate bluff, or a grassy mound, marking the site of some mysterious\r\nEtruscan or Sabine city that had perished ages before Romulus had laid\r\nthe foundations of Rome. From the contemplation of these wide\r\ncheerless wastes beyond the confines of history, peopled with shadowy\r\nforms, with whose long-buried hopes and sorrows no mortal heart can\r\nnow sympathise, I turn back to the fresh, warm, human interests that\r\nawait me in the Rome of to-day; feeling to the full that from home to\r\nchurch I have passed through scenes and associations sufficient to\r\nmake a Sabbath in Rome a day standing out from all other days, never\r\nto be forgotten!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE APPIAN WAY\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the proud boast of the ancient Romans that all roads led to\r\ntheir city. Rome was the centre and mistress of the world; and as the\r\nloneliest rill that rises in the bosom of the far-off mountain leads,\r\nif followed, to the ocean, so every path in the remotest corner of the\r\nvast empire conducted to the great gilded column in the Roman Forum,\r\nupon which all distances without the walls were marked. To the Romans\r\nthe world is indebted for opening up communications with different\r\ncountries. They were the great engineers and road-makers of antiquity.\r\nThis seems to have been the work assigned to them in the household of\r\nnations. Rome broke down the barriers that separated one nation from\r\nanother, and fused all distinctions of race and language and religion\r\ninto one great commonwealth. And for the cohesion of all the elements\r\nof this huge political fabric nothing could have been more effectual\r\nthan the magnificent roads, by which constant communication was kept\r\nup between all parts of the empire, and armies could be transported to\r\nquell a rising rebellion in some outlying province with the smallest\r\nexpenditure of time and strength. In this way the genius of this\r\nwonderful people was providentially made subservient to the interests\r\nof Christianity. At the very time that our Lord commissioned, with His\r\nparting breath, the apostles to preach the gospel to every creature,\r\nthe way was prepared for the fulfilment of that commission. The\r\ncrooked places had been made straight, and the rough places smooth.\r\nAlong the roads which the Romans made throughout the world for the\r\nmarch of their armies and the consolidation of their government, the\r\napostles, the soldiers of the Prince of Peace, marched to grander and\r\nmore enduring victories.\r\n\r\nOf all the roads of ancient Rome the Via Appia was the oldest and most\r\nrenowned. It was called by the Romans themselves the _regina viarum_,\r\nthe \"queen of roads.\" It was constructed by Appius Claudius the Blind,\r\nduring the Samnite War, when he was Censor, three hundred and thirteen\r\nyears before Christ, and led from Rome to Capua, being carried over\r\nthe Pontine Marshes on an embankment. It was afterwards extended to\r\nBrindisi, the ancient seaport of Rome on the Adriatic, and became the\r\ngreat highway for travellers from Rome to Greece and all the eastern\r\nprovinces of the Roman Empire. A curious link of connection may be\r\ntraced between the modern Italian expression, when drinking to a\r\nperson's health on leaving home, \"far Brindisi,\" and the distant\r\ntermination of the Appian Way, suggestive, as of old, of farewell\r\nwishes for a prosperous journey and a speedy return to the parting\r\nguest. The way was paved throughout with broad hexagonal slabs of hard\r\nlava, exactly fitted to each other; and here and there along its\r\ncourse may still be seen important remains of it, which prove its\r\nexcellent workmanship. This method of constructing roads was borrowed\r\nby the Romans from the Carthaginians, and was tried for the first time\r\non the Appian Way, all previous roads having been formed of sand and\r\ngravel. The greatest breadth of the road was about twenty-six feet\r\nbetween the curbstones; and on both sides were placed, at intervals of\r\nforty feet, low columns, as seats for the travel-worn, and as helps in\r\nmounting on horseback. Distances of five thousand feet were marked by\r\nmilestones, which were in the form of columnar shafts, elevated on\r\npedestals with appropriate inscriptions. The physical wants of the\r\ntraveller were provided for at inns judiciously disposed along the\r\nroute; while his religious wants were gratified by frequent statues of\r\nMercury, Apollo, Diana, Ceres, Hercules, and other deities, who\r\npresided over highways and journeys, casting their sacred shadow over\r\nhis path. Some of the stones of the pavement still show the ruts of\r\nthe old chariot-wheels, and others are a good deal cracked and worn;\r\nbut they are sound enough, probably, to outlast the modern little\r\ncubes which have replaced them in some parts. A road formed in this\r\nmost substantial manner for about two hundred miles, involving\r\ncuttings through rocks, filling up of hollows, bridging of ravines,\r\nand embanking of swamps, must have been an arduous and costly feat of\r\nengineering. Appius Claudius is said to have exhausted the Roman\r\ntreasury in defraying the expenses of its construction. It was\r\nfrequently repaired, owing to the heavy traffic upon it, by Julius, by\r\nAugustus, Vespasian, Domitian, Nerva, and very thoroughly by the\r\nEmperor Trajan. In some parts, where the soft ground had subsided, a\r\nsecond pavement was laid over the first; and in the Pontine Marshes we\r\nobserve traces of no less than three pavements superimposed above each\r\nother to preserve the proper level.\r\n\r\nFor a considerable distance outside the Porta Capena, where it\r\ncommenced, the Appian Way was lined on both sides with tombs belonging\r\nto patrician families. This was the case, indeed, with all the other\r\nroads of Rome that were converted into avenues of death owing to the\r\nstrenuous law which prohibited all interments within the walls; but\r\nthe Appian Way was specially distinguished for the number and\r\nmagnificence of its tombs. The most illustrious names of ancient Rome\r\nwere interred beside it. At first the sepulchres of the heroes of the\r\nearly ages were the only ones; but under the Cæsars these were\r\neclipsed by the funereal pomp of the freedmen, the parasites and\r\nsycophants of the emperors. At first the tombs were built of volcanic\r\nstone, the only building material found in the neighbourhood; but as\r\nRome became mistress of the world, and gathered the marbles and\r\nprecious stones of the conquered countries into its own bosom, and as\r\nwealth and luxury increased, the tombs were constructed altogether of\r\nor cased on the outside with these valuable materials. And this\r\ncircumstance gives us a clue to the age of the different monuments.\r\n\r\nThe custom of bordering the main approaches of the city with\r\nsepulchral monuments was, in all likelihood, derived from the\r\nEtruscans, to whom the Romans owed many of their institutions. These\r\nmonuments were usually structures of great beauty and elegance. Some\r\nof them were fashioned as conical mounds, on the slopes of which trees\r\nand parterres of flowers were planted; others were built after the\r\nmodel of graceful Grecian temples; others were huge circular masses of\r\nmasonry; and others were simple sarcophagi with lids, resting on\r\nsquare elevated pedestals. Most of them were adorned with busts and\r\nstatues of the departed, with altars, columns, and carvings. What\r\nthese tombs were in their prime, it is difficult for us to picture;\r\nbut even their remains at the present day produce the conviction that\r\nno grander mode of approach to a great city could have been devised.\r\n\r\nIt would seem to us altogether incongruous to line our public roads\r\nwith tombs, and to transact the business and pursue the pleasures of\r\nthe living among the dead. All our ideas of propriety would be shocked\r\nby seeing a circus for athletic games beside a cemetery. But the\r\nancient Romans had no such feeling. They buried their dead, not in\r\nlonely spots and obscure churchyards as we do, but where the life of\r\nthe city was gayest. One of the grandest of their sepulchral monuments\r\nwas placed beside one of the most frequented of their circuses. The\r\nlast objects which a Roman beheld when he left the city, and the first\r\nthat greeted him on his coming back, were the tombs of his ancestors\r\nand friends; and their silent admonition did not deepen the sadness\r\nof farewell, or cast a shadow upon the joy of return. Many of the\r\nmarble sarcophagi were ornamented with beautiful bas-reliefs of\r\nmythical incidents, utterly inconsistent, we should suppose, with the\r\npurpose for which they were designed. Nuptials, bacchanalian fêtes,\r\ngames, and dances, are crowded upon their sculptured sides, in seeming\r\nmockery of the pitiable relics of humanity within. They treated death\r\nlightly and playfully, these ancient Romans, and tried to hide his\r\nterror with a mask of smiles, and to cover his dart with a wreath of\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\nWhy is it that we Christians look upon death with feelings so widely\r\ndifferent? Why, when life and immortality have been brought to light\r\nin the gospel, are the mementoes of mortality more painful and\r\nsaddening to us than they were to these pagans who had no hopes of a\r\nresurrection? It seems a paradox, but the Christianity which has\r\nbrought the greatest hope into the world has also brought the greatest\r\nfear. By increasing the value of life, our religion has increased the\r\nfear of death. By quickening the conscience, it has quickened the\r\nimagination; and that death which to the man conscious only of a\r\nphysical existence is the mere natural termination of life, to the\r\nnature convinced of sin is a violent breach of the beautiful order of\r\nthe world, and the gate to final retribution. The ancient Roman was\r\nbut a child in spiritual apprehension, and therefore as a child he\r\nsurrendered his happy pagan life as thoughtlessly as the weary child\r\nfalls asleep at the end of its play. No terrors of futurity darkened\r\nhis last hours; he had his own turn at the feast of life, and as a\r\nsatisfied guest he was content to depart and make room for others. As\r\ncheerfully as he had formerly begun his ordinary journeys from Rome\r\nthrough a street of tombs, so now he took the last journey, he knew\r\nnot whither, through the valley of the shadow of death, and feared no\r\nevil; not because a greater Power was with him to defend him, but\r\nbecause for him no evil except the common pangs of dissolution\r\nexisted. All that he cared for in death was that he should not be\r\naltogether separated from the presence and the enjoyments of human\r\nlife, from the haunts where he had been so happy. He wished to have\r\nhis tomb on the public thoroughfare, that he might \"feel, as it were,\r\nthe tide of life as it flowed past his monument, and that his mute\r\nexistence might be prolonged in the remembrance of his friends.\" I may\r\nobserve that the Roman custom of bordering the public roads with tombs\r\ngives a significance to the inscriptions which some of them\r\nbore,--such as, _Siste, viator_--_Aspice, viator_, \"Stop,\r\ntraveller\"--\"Look, traveller\"; a significance which is altogether lost\r\nwhen the same inscriptions are carved, as we have often seen them, on\r\ntombstones in secluded country churchyards where no traveller ever\r\npasses by, and hardly even friends come to weep.\r\n\r\nModern Rome is unlike all other European cities in this respect, that\r\na short distance beyond its gates you plunge at once into a desert.\r\nThere is no gradual subsidence of the busy life of the gay metropolis,\r\nthrough suburban houses, villages, and farms, into the quiet seclusion\r\nof the country. You pass abruptly from the seat of the most refined\r\narts into the most primitive solitude, where the pulse of life hardly\r\nbeats. The desolation of the Campagna, that green motionless sea of\r\nsilence, comes up to and almost washes the walls of the city. You know\r\nthat you are in the immediate neighbourhood of a teeming population;\r\nbut you might as well be a hundred miles away in the heart of the\r\nApennines, for any signs of human culture or habitation that you\r\nperceive within the horizon. There is no traffic on the road; and only\r\nat rare intervals do you meet with a solitary peasant, looking like a\r\nsatyr in shaggy goat-skin breeches, and glaring wildly at you from his\r\ngreat black eyes as he crosses the waste. Far as the eye can see there\r\nis nothing but a melancholy plain, studded here and there with a ruin,\r\nand populous only with the visionary forms of the past; and its\r\ntragic beauty prepares your mind for passing into the solemn shadow of\r\nthe great Niobe of cities. But it was not thus in the brilliant days\r\nof the Empire. For fifteen miles beyond the walls the Appian Way\r\nstretched to the beautiful blue Alban hills, through a continuous\r\nsuburb of the city, adorned with all the charms of nature and art,\r\npalatial villas and pleasure-gardens, groves and vineyards, temples\r\nand far-extending aqueducts. These homes and fashionable haunts of the\r\nliving were interspersed in strange association with the tombs of the\r\ndead. Through the gate a constant stream of human life passed in and\r\nout; and crowds of chariots and horsemen and wayfarers thronged the\r\nroad from morning to night.\r\n\r\nIt is only seventeen years since the true point of commencement of the\r\nAppian Way was discovered. For a long time the Porta Capena by which\r\nit left Rome was supposed to be situated outside of the present walls,\r\nin the valley of the Almo. But Dr. Parker, at the period indicated,\r\nmaking some excavations in the narrowest part of the valley between\r\nthe Coelian and Aventine hills, came upon some massive remains of the\r\noriginal wall of Servius Tullius, and in these he found the true site\r\nof the Porta Capena. This discovery, confirming the supposition of\r\nAmpère and others, cleared up much that was inexplicable in the\r\ntopography of this part of Rome, and enabled antiquarians to fix the\r\nrelative position of all the historical spots. The Via Appia is thus\r\nshown to have extended upwards of three-quarters of a mile within the\r\npresent area of the city, over the space between the wall of Servius\r\nTullius and the wall of Aurelian. And this is still further confirmed\r\nby the discovery, three hundred years ago, of the first milestone of\r\nthe Appian Way in a vineyard, a short distance beyond the modern gate\r\nof St. Sebastian, marking exactly a Roman mile from that point to the\r\nsite of Dr. Parker's discovery. This milestone now forms one of the\r\nornaments on the balustrade at the head of the stairs of the Capitol.\r\n\r\nThe Appian Way shared in the vicissitudes of the city. After the fall\r\nof the Western Empire, about the beginning of the sixth century, when\r\nit was finally repaired by Theodoric, it fell into desuetude. The\r\npeople, owing to the unsettled state of the country, were afraid to\r\nmove from home. A grievous apathy took possession of all classes;\r\nagriculture was neglected, and the drains being stopped up, the line\r\nof route was inundated, and the road, especially on the low levels,\r\nbecame quite impassable. For centuries it continued in this state,\r\nuntil it was overgrown with a marshy vegetation in the wet places, and\r\ncovered with turf in the dry. About a hundred years ago Pope Pius VI.\r\ndrained the Pontine Marshes, and restored other parts of the road, and\r\nmade it available as the ordinary land-route from Rome to Naples. But\r\nit was left to Pio Nono to uncover the road between Rome and Albano,\r\nwhich had previously been confounded with the Campagna, and was only\r\nindicated by the double line of ruined tombs. After three years of\r\nhard work, and an expenditure of £3000, the part most interesting to\r\nthe archæologist--namely, from the third to the eleventh\r\nmilestone--was laid bare, its monuments identified as far as possible,\r\nand a wall of loose stones built on both sides, to protect it from the\r\nencroachments of the neighbouring landowners. And now the modern\r\ntraveller can walk or ride or drive comfortably over the very pavement\r\nwhich Horace and Virgil, Augustus and Paul traversed, and gaze upon\r\nthe ruins of the very objects that met their eyes.\r\n\r\nTaking our departure from the site of the Porta Capena, we are\r\nreminded that it was at the Porta Capena that the survivor of the\r\nHoratii met his sister, who had been betrothed to one of the Curiatii,\r\nand who, when she saw her brother carrying the cloak of her dead\r\nlover, which she had wrought with her own hand, upbraided him in a\r\npassion of tears for his cruelty. Enraged at the sight of her grief,\r\nHoratius drew his sword and stabbed her to the heart, crying, \"So\r\nperish the Roman maiden that shall weep for her country's enemy!\" The\r\ntomb of the hapless maiden long stood on the spot. It was at the Porta\r\nCapena also that the senate and people of Rome gave to Cicero a\r\nsplendid ovation on his return from banishment. Numerous historical\r\nbuildings clustered round this gate--a temple of Mars, of Hercules, of\r\nHonour and Virtue, and a fountain dedicated to Mercury, described by\r\nOvid; but not a trace of these now remains.\r\n\r\nOn the left, at the back of the Coelian Hill, is a valley covered with\r\nverdure, wonderfully quiet and rural-looking, though within the walls\r\nof a city. In this valley once stood the famous grove where Numa\r\nPompilius had his mysterious interviews with the nymph Egeria. A\r\nspring still bubbles forth beside a cluster of farm-buildings, which\r\nis said to be the veritable Fountain of Egeria. The temple of the\r\nMuses, who were Egeria's counsellors, was close by; and the name of\r\nthe gate of the city, _Porta Capena_, was in all likelihood a\r\ncorruption of Camena, the Latin name for Muse, and was not derived, as\r\nsome suppose, from the city of Capua. The spot outside the present\r\nwalls, formerly visited as the haunt of the fabled nymph, before the\r\ndiscovery of the site of the Capena gate fixed its true\r\nposition--beautiful and romantic as it is--was only the nymphæum of\r\nsome Roman villa, used as a place of retirement and coolness in the\r\noppressive heat of summer. Of all the legends of Rome's earliest days,\r\nnone is more poetical than that which speaks of the visits of Numa to\r\nthis mysterious being, whose counsels in these sacred shades were of\r\nsuch value to him in the management of his kingdom, and who dictated\r\nto him the whole religious institutions and civil legislation of Rome.\r\nWhatever historical basis it may have, the legend has at least a core\r\nof moral truth. It illustrates the necessity of solitude and communion\r\nwith Higher Powers as a preparation for the solemn duties of life. All\r\nwho have influenced men permanently for good have drawn their\r\ninspiration from lonely haunts sacred to meditation--ever since Moses\r\nsaw the burning bush in the desert, and Elijah bowed his strong soul\r\nto the majesty of the still small voice at Horeb.\r\n\r\nThe romance of the grove of Egeria was, however, dispelled when the\r\nvalley was turned into a place of imprisonment for the Jews. Domitian\r\ndrove them out of the Ghetto, and shut them up here, with only a\r\nbasket and a wisp of hay for each person, to undergo unheard-of\r\nprivations and miseries. The Horticultural Gardens, where the shrubs\r\nand plants are grown that ornament the public squares and terraces of\r\nthe city, now occupy the site of the celebrated grove. The shrill\r\nscream of the railway whistle outside the gate, and the smell of the\r\ngas-works near at hand--these veritable things of the present\r\ncentury--are fatal to all enchantments, and effectually dissipate the\r\nspell of the muses and the mystic fragrance of the Egerian solitude.\r\nBut wonderful is the persistence of a spring in a spot. Continually\r\nchanging, it is the most changeless of all things. For ever passing\r\naway, it is yet the most steadfast and enduring. Derived from the\r\nfleeting vapour--the emblem of inconstancy--it outlasts the most solid\r\nstructure of man, and continues to well up its waters even when the\r\nrock beside it has weathered into dust. The Fountain of Egeria flows\r\nto-day in the hollow of the Coelian Hill as it flowed nigh three\r\nthousand years ago, although the muses have fled, and the deities\r\nPicus and Faunus, which Numa entrapped in the wood of the Aventine,\r\nhave gone back to their native skies with Jupiter; and Mammon and\r\nPhilosophy have exorcised that unseen world which once presented so\r\nmany beauties and wonders to the imagination of man.\r\n\r\nA little farther on to the right, a side path, called the Via\r\nAntonina, leads up to the stupendous ruins of the Baths of Caracalla,\r\na mile in circumference, and covering a space of 2,625,000 square\r\nyards. The walls, arches, and domes of massive brickwork hanging up in\r\nthe sky,--the fragments of sculpture and splendid mosaic pavements\r\nbelonging to these baths,--produced a deeper impression upon my mind\r\nthan even the ruins of the Colosseum. With the form and majesty of the\r\nColosseum, owing to its compactness and unity, pictures and other\r\nrepresentations have made us familiar from infancy, so that it excites\r\nno surprise when we actually visit it; but the Baths of Caracalla\r\ncannot be pictorially represented as a whole, on account of their vast\r\nvariety and extent, and therefore we come to the spectacle wholly\r\nunprepared, and are at once startled into awe and astonishment.\r\nNotwithstanding the wholesale pillage of centuries, enough in the way\r\nof chambers and baths, marble statues, pillars, and works of art,\r\nstill remains in this mountainous mass of masonry to witness to the\r\nunparalleled luxury by which the strength of the Roman youth was\r\nenervated, and the foundations of the empire sapped. Shelley wrote on\r\nthe summit of one of the arches his \"Prometheus Unbound;\" and\r\ncertainly a fitter place in which to seek inspiration for such a theme\r\ncould not be found.\r\n\r\nBeyond the Baths, on the same side of the road, is the most\r\ninteresting little church of the two saints Nereus and Achilles,\r\nChristian slaves who suffered martyrdom in the reign of Diocletian. It\r\nis supposed that the Nereus whose body reposes in this ancient church\r\nis the person referred to by St. Paul in his greetings to the Roman\r\nsaints at the close of his Epistle--\"Salute Nereus, and his sister,\r\nand Olympas, and all the saints which are with them.\" Bolland, in his\r\n_Acts of the Saints_, mentions that he was a servant in the household\r\nof Flavia Domitilla, niece of the celebrated Christian lady of the\r\nsame name, whose mother was the sister of the Emperor Domitian, and\r\nwhose two sons were intended to succeed to the imperial throne. This\r\nyounger Domitilla, although so nearly related to the imperial family,\r\nwas banished to the island of Pontia, because of her refusal to\r\nsacrifice to idols. Her two Christian servants, Nereus and Achilles,\r\naccompanied her in her exile, and were afterwards burned alive, along\r\nwith their mistress, at Terracina, and their ashes deposited in the\r\nsame resting-place. It is a remarkable circumstance that this church\r\nand the catacomb where they were buried at first, should have borne\r\nthe names of the lowly slaves instead of the name of their illustrious\r\nmistress, who was as distinguished by her Christian faith as by her\r\nrank. Time brought to these noble martyrs a worthy revenge for their\r\nignoble fate; for when their ashes were taken from the catacomb to\r\nthis church in the year 524, they were first carried in triumph to the\r\nCapitol, and made to pass under the imperial arches, on which was\r\naffixed the inscriptions \"The Senate and the Roman people to Santa\r\nFlavia Domitilla, for having brought more honour to Rome by her death\r\nthan her illustrious relations by their works.\" \"To Santa Flavia\r\nDomitilla, and to the saints Nereus and Achilles, the excellent\r\ncitizens who gained peace for the Christian republic at the price of\r\ntheir blood.\" Jeremy Taylor, in his splendid sermon on the\r\n\"Marriage-ring,\" has a touching reference to the legendary history of\r\nNereus. The church dedicated to the honour of these Christian slaves\r\nhas many interesting associations. It stands upon the site of a\r\nprimitive Christian oratory, called Fasciola, because St. Peter was\r\nsaid to have dropped there one of the bandages of his wounds on the\r\nway to execution. And its last reconstruction, retaining all the\r\nfeatures of the old architecture with the utmost care, was the pious\r\nwork of its titular cardinal, Cæsar Baronius, the celebrated librarian\r\nof the Vatican, whose Ecclesiastical Annals may be called the earliest\r\nsystematic work on Church History. The church has an enclosed choir,\r\nwith two ambones or reading-desks in it, surrounding the altar, as was\r\nthe custom in the older Christian churches. The mosaics on the tribune\r\nrepresenting the \"Transfiguration\" and \"Annunciation\" are more than a\r\nthousand years old, and are interesting besides as the first\r\nembodiments in art of these sacred subjects. Behind the high altar is\r\nthe pontifical chair, supported by lions, with a Gothic gable, on\r\nwhich Gregory the Great was seated when he delivered his twenty-eighth\r\nHomily, a few sentences of which are engraved on the marble.\r\n\r\nBeyond the church of Sts. Nereus and Achilles, on the opposite side,\r\nwhere the ground rises thirty or forty feet above the level of the\r\nroad, there is a rude inscription above the door of a vineyard,\r\nintimating that the Tomb of the Scipios is here. This is by far the\r\nmost interesting of all the monuments on the Appian Way. It was the\r\nmausoleum of a long line of the most illustrious names in Roman\r\nhistory--patriots and heroes, whose virtues and honours were\r\nhereditary. Originally the sepulchre stood above ground, and the\r\nentrance to it was by a solid arch of peperino, facing a cross-road\r\nleading from the Appian to the Latin Way; but the soil in the course\r\nof ages accumulated over it, and buried it out of sight. It was\r\naccidentally discovered in 1780, in consequence of a peasant digging\r\nin the vineyard to make a cellar, and breaking through a part of the\r\nvaulted roof of the tomb. Then was brought suddenly to light the\r\ncelebrated sarcophagus of plain peperino stone, which contained the\r\nremains of the Roman consul, Lucius Scipio Barbatus, after having been\r\nundisturbed for nearly twenty-two centuries. Several other sarcophagi\r\nbelonging to members of the family were found at the same time, along\r\nwith two busts, one of which is supposed to be that of the poet\r\nEnnius, the friend and companion of Scipio Africanus, whose last\r\nrequest on his deathbed was that he might be buried by his side. Pliny\r\nremarks that the Scipios had the singular custom of burying instead of\r\nburning their dead; and this is confirmed by the discovery of these\r\nsarcophagi. I found the mausoleum to consist of a series of chambers\r\nand approaches to them, excavated in the solid tufa rock, not unlike\r\nthe labyrinthine recesses of the catacombs. The darkness was feebly\r\ndispelled by the light of wax tapers carried by the guide and myself;\r\nand the aspect of the narrow, low-browed passages and chambers was\r\ngloomy in the extreme. Here and there were Latin inscriptions\r\nattached to the different recesses where the dead had lain; but they\r\nwere only copies, the originals having been removed to the Vatican,\r\nwhere the sarcophagus of Lucius Scipio Barbatus and the bust of the\r\npoet Ennius may now be seen. The very bones of the illustrious dead\r\nhave been carried off, and after a series of adventures they are now\r\ndeposited in a beautiful little monument in the grounds of a nobleman\r\nnear Padua. The gold signet-ring of Scipio Africanus, with a victory\r\nin intaglio on a cornelian stone, found in the tomb of his son, who\r\nwas buried here, is now in the possession of Lord Beverley. It must be\r\nremembered, however, that Scipio Africanus, the most illustrious of\r\nhis family, and the noblest of all the Roman names, was not interred\r\nin this mausoleum. A strange mystery hung over the manner of his death\r\nand the place of his burial even in Livy's time. Some said that he\r\ndied at Rome, and others at Liternum. A fragment of an inscription was\r\nfound near the little lake at the latter place, beside which he\r\nresided during the dignified exile of his later years, which contained\r\nonly the words--\"... ta Patria ... ne ...\" Antiquarians have filled\r\nout this sentence into the touching epigraph recorded by Livy, which\r\nScipio himself wished to be put upon his tomb: \"Ingrata Patria, ne\r\nossa quidem, mea habes,\" \"My ungrateful country, thou hast not even my\r\nbones.\" Empty as the tomb of the Scipios looks, no one can behold it\r\nwithout feelings of profound veneration. The history of the most\r\nheroic period of ancient Rome is linked with this tomb; and all the\r\nromance of the Punic Wars, of Hannibal and Hasdrubal, pass before the\r\nmind's eye, as one gazes upon the desecrated chambers where the son\r\nand relatives of the great conqueror had reposed in death.\r\n\r\nWithin a short distance of the tomb of the Scipios are the most\r\ncelebrated of all the Columbaria of Rome. Previous to the fifth\r\ncentury of Rome, the bodies of the dead were buried entire, and\r\ndeposited in sarcophagi; but after that period cremation became the\r\nuniversal custom. The ashes and calcined bones were preserved in\r\n_ollæ_, or little jars like common garden flower-pots, made of the\r\nsame kind of coarse red earthenware, with a lid attached. These jars\r\nwere deposited in rows of little niches sunk in the brickwork all\r\nround the walls of the tomb, resembling the nests in a pigeon-house;\r\nhence the origin of the name. One tomb was thus capable of containing\r\nthe remains of a large number of persons; no less than six thousand of\r\nthe freedmen of Augustus being deposited in the Columbarium which\r\nbears their name. The entrance to these sepulchral chambers was from\r\nthe top, descending by an internal stair; and the passages and walls\r\nwere usually decorated with frescoes and arabesques, illustrating some\r\nmythical or historical subject. The names of the dead were carved on\r\nmarble tablets fixed above the pigeon-holes containing the ashes.\r\nColumbaria being only used for dependents and slaves, were generally\r\nerected near the tombs of their masters; and hence all along the\r\nAppian Way we see numerous traces of them side by side with the\r\ngigantic monuments of the patrician families. The Columbaria near the\r\ntomb of the Scipios are three in number, and contain the cinerary urns\r\nof persons attached to the household of the emperors from the reign of\r\nAugustus up to the period of the Antonines, when the system of burying\r\nthe bodies entire was again introduced. The last discovered\r\nColumbarium is the most interesting of the group. Being only\r\nthirty-three years exposed, the paintings on the walls and the vases\r\nare remarkably well preserved. This tomb contains the ashes of the\r\ndependents of Tiberius, the contemporary of our Lord. One pigeon-hole\r\nis filled with the calcined bones of the court buffoon, a poor deaf\r\nand dumb slave who had wonderful powers of mimicry, and used to amuse\r\nhis morose master by imitating the gesticulations of the advocates\r\npleading in the Forum. Another pigeon-hole contains the remains of the\r\nkeeper of the library of Apollo in the imperial palace on the\r\nPalatine. A most pathetic lamentation in verse is made by one Julia\r\nPrima over the ashes of her husband; and an inscription, along with a\r\nportrait of the animal, records that beneath are the remains of a\r\nfavourite dog that was the pet of the whole household--a little touch\r\nof nature that links the ages and the zones, and makes the whole world\r\nkin. The whole of this region, called Monte d'Oro, for what reason I\r\nknow not, seems to have been a vast necropolis, in which not only\r\nColumbaria for their slaves and freedmen were built by the great\r\npatrician families, but also family vaults for the wealthier middle\r\nclasses were constructed and sold by speculators, just as in our\r\nmodern town cemeteries.\r\n\r\nVery near the modern gate of the city the road passes under the\r\nso-called Arch of Drusus. It consists of a single arch, whose keystone\r\nprojects on each side about two feet and a half beyond the plane of\r\nthe frontage; and is built of huge solid blocks of travertine, with\r\ncornices of white marble, and two composite columns of African marble\r\non each side, much soiled and defaced, which are so inferior in style\r\nto the rest of the architecture that they are manifestly later\r\nadditions. The whole monument is much worn and injured; but it is made\r\nexceedingly picturesque by a crown of verdure upon the thick mass of\r\nsoil accumulated there by small increments blown up from the highway\r\nin the course of so many centuries. It was long supposed that\r\nCaracalla had barbarously taken advantage of the arch to carry across\r\nthe highway at this point the aqueduct which supplied his baths with\r\nwater. But the more recent authorities maintain that the arch itself,\r\nso far from being the monument of Drusus, was only one of the arches\r\nbuilt by Caracalla in a more ornamental way than the rest, as was\r\ncommonly done when an aqueduct crossed a public road. This theory does\r\naway at one fell stroke with the idea so long fondly cherished that\r\nSt. Paul must have passed under this very arch on his way to Rome, and\r\nthat his eye must have rested on these very stones upon which we gaze\r\nnow. It is hard to give up the belief that the stern old arch, severe\r\nin its sturdiness and simplicity as the character of the apostle\r\nhimself, did actually cast its haunted shadow over him on the\r\nmemorable day when, a prisoner in chains in charge of a Roman soldier,\r\nhe passed over this part of the Appian Way, and it signalised a far\r\ngrander triumph than that for which it was originally erected. We\r\nshould greatly prefer to retain the old idea that under that arch\r\nChristianity, as represented by St. Paul, passed to its conquest of\r\nthe whole Roman world; and passed too in character, the religion of\r\nthe cross, joy in sorrow, liberty in bonds, strength in weakness,\r\nproclaiming itself best from the midst of the sufferings which it\r\novercame.\r\n\r\nImmediately beyond the Arch of Drusus is the Gate of St. Sebastian,\r\nthe Porta Appia of the Aurelian wall, protected on either side by two\r\nsemicircular towers, which from their great height and massiveness\r\nhave a most imposing appearance. They are composed of the beautiful\r\nglowing brick of the ancient Roman structures, and rest upon a\r\nfoundation of white marble blocks, evidently taken from the Temple of\r\nMars, which once stood close by, and at which the armies entering Rome\r\nin triumph used to halt. The gateway was greatly injured in the sixth\r\ncentury during the Gothic War, but was repaired by Belisarius; or, as\r\nsome say, by Narses. The most remarkable incident connected with it\r\nsince that period was the triumphal entry into the city of Marco\r\nAntonio Colonna, after the victory of Lepanto over the Turks and\r\nAfrican corsairs in 1571. This famous battle, one of the few great\r\ndecisive battles of the world, belongs equally to civil and\r\necclesiastical history, having checked the spread of Mohammedanism in\r\nEastern Europe, and thus altered the fortunes of the Church and the\r\nworld. The famous Spanish poet Cervantes lost an arm in this battle.\r\nThe ovation given to Colonna by the Romans in connection with it may\r\nbe said to be the last of the long series of triumphal processions\r\nwhich entered the Eternal City; and in point of splendour and ceremony\r\nit vied with the grandest of them,--prisoners and their families,\r\nalong with the spoil taken from the enemy, figuring in it as of old. A\r\nshort distance outside the gate, the viaduct of the railway from\r\nCivita Vecchia spans the Appian Way, and brings the ancient \"queen of\r\nroads\" and the modern iron-way into strange contrast,--or rather, I\r\nshould say, into fitting contact; for there is a resemblance between\r\nthe great works of ancient and modern engineering skill in their\r\nmighty enterprise and boundless command of physical resources, which\r\nwe do not find in the works of the intermediate ages.\r\n\r\nBeyond the viaduct the road descends into a valley, at the bottom of\r\nwhich runs the classic Almo. It is little better than a ditch, with\r\nartificial banks overgrown with weeds, great glossy-leaved arums, and\r\nmilky-veined thistles, and with a little dirty water in it from the\r\ndrainings of the surrounding vineyards. And yet this disenchanted\r\nbrook figures largely in ancient mythical story. Ovid sang of it, and\r\nCicero's letters mention it honourably. It was renowned for its\r\nmedicinal properties, and diseased cattle were brought to its banks to\r\nbe healed. The famous _simulacrum_, called the image of Cybele,--a\r\nblack meteoric stone which fell from the sky at Phrygia, and was\r\nbrought to Rome during the Second Punic War, according to the\r\nSybilline instructions,--was washed every spring in the waters of the\r\nAlmo by the priests of the goddess. So persistent was this pagan\r\ncustom, even amid the altered circumstances of Christianity, that,\r\nuntil the commencement of the nineteenth century, an image of our\r\nSaviour was annually brought from the Church of Santa Martina in the\r\nForum and washed in this stream. In the valley of the Almo the poet\r\nTerence possessed a little farm of twenty acres, given to him by his\r\nfriend Scipio Æmilianus.\r\n\r\nAfter crossing the Almo, two huge shapeless masses of ruins may be\r\nseen above the vineyard walls: that on the left is said to be the\r\ntomb of Geta, the son of the Emperor Severus, who was put to death in\r\nhis mother's arms by order of his unnatural brother. Geta's children\r\nand friends, to the number, it is said, of twenty thousand persons,\r\nwere also put to death on the false accusation of conspiracy; among\r\nwhom was the celebrated jurist Papinian, who, when required to compose\r\na defence of the murder--as Seneca was asked by Nero to apologise for\r\nhis crime--nobly replied that \"it was easier to commit than to justify\r\nfratricide.\" But so capricious was Caracalla that he soon afterwards\r\nexecuted the accomplices of his unnatural deed, and caused his\r\nmurdered brother to be placed among the gods, and divine honours to be\r\npaid to him. It was in this more humane mood that the tomb whose ruins\r\nwe see on the Appian Way was ordered to be built. The tomb on the\r\nright-hand side of the road is a most incongruous structure as it\r\nappears at present, having a circular medieval tower on the top of it,\r\nand a common osteria or wine-shop in front; but the old niches in\r\nwhich statues or busts used to stand still remain. It was long\r\nsupposed to be the mausoleum of the Scipios; but it is now ascertained\r\nto be the sepulchre of Priscilla, the wife of Abascantius, the\r\nfavourite freedman of Domitian, celebrated for his conjugal affection\r\nby the poet Statius. Covered with ivy and mural plants, the monument\r\nhas a very picturesque appearance.\r\n\r\nThe road beyond this rises from the valley of the Almo, and passes\r\nover a kind of plateau. It is hemmed in on either side by high ugly\r\nwalls, shaggy with a profusion of plants which affect such situations.\r\nThe wild mignonette hangs out its pale yellow spikes of blossoms, but\r\nwithout the fragrance for which its garden sister is so remarkable;\r\nand the common pellitory, a near ally of the nettle, which haunts all\r\nold ruins, clings in great masses to the crevices, its leaves and\r\nignoble blossoms white with the dust of the road. Here and there a\r\ntall straggling plant of purple lithospermum has found a footing, and\r\nflourishes aloft its dark violet tiara of blossoms; while bright tufts\r\nof wall-flower send up their tongues of flame from an old tomb peering\r\nabove the wall, as if from a funeral pyre. The St. Mary thistle grows\r\nat the foot of the walls in knots of large, spreading, crinkled\r\nleaves, beautifully scalloped at the edges; the glazed surface\r\nreticulated with lacteal veins, retaining the milk that, according to\r\nthe legend, flowed from the Virgin's breast, and, forming the Milky\r\nWay in mid-heaven, fell down to earth upon this wayside thistle. Huge\r\ncolumns of cactuses and monster aloes may be seen rising above the top\r\nof the walls, like relics of a geologic flora contemporaneous with the\r\nage of the extinct volcanoes around. But the most curious of all the\r\nplants that adorn the walls is a kind of ivy which, instead of the\r\nusual dark-greenish or black berries, bears yellow ones. This species\r\nis rare, but here it occurs in profusion, and is as beautiful in\r\nfoliage as it is singular in fruit. The walls themselves, apart from\r\ntheir floral adorning, are very remarkable, and deserving of the most\r\ncareful and leisurely study. They are built up evidently of the\r\nremains of tombs; and numerous fragments of marble sarcophagi,\r\npillars, inscriptions, and rich sculpture are imbedded in them,\r\nsuggestive of a whole volume of antiquarian lore, so that he who runs\r\nmay read.\r\n\r\nOn the right of the road, in a vineyard, are several Columbaria\r\nbelonging to the family of Cæcilius, an obscure Latin poet, who was a\r\npredecessor of Terence, and died one hundred and sixty-eight years\r\nbefore Christ; and on the left are the Columbaria of the freedmen of\r\nAugustus and Livia, divided into three chambers. These last when\r\ndiscovered excited the utmost interest among antiquarians; but they\r\nare now stripped of all their contents and characteristic decorations,\r\nand the inscriptions, about three hundred in number, are preserved in\r\nthe museums of the Capitol and Vatican. On the same side of the road,\r\nin a vineyard, a Columbarium was discovered in 1825 belonging to the\r\nVolusian family, who flourished in the reign of Nero; one of whose\r\nmembers, Lucius Volusius, who lived to the age of ninety-three, was\r\nextolled on account of his exemplary life by Tacitus.\r\n\r\nOn the same plateau is the entrance to the celebrated Catacombs of St.\r\nCalixtus. It is on the right-hand side of the road, about a mile and a\r\nquarter from the present gate, and near where stood the second\r\nmilestone on the ancient Appian Way. A marble tablet over the door of\r\na vineyard shaded with cypresses points it out to the visitor. The\r\nrock out of which this and all the Roman Catacombs were hewn seems as\r\nif created specially for the purpose. Recent geological observations\r\nhave traced in the Campagna volcanic matter produced at different\r\nperiods, when the entire area of Rome and its vicinity was the seat of\r\nactive plutonic agency. This material is of varying degrees of\r\nhardness. The lowest and oldest is so firm and compact that it still\r\nfurnishes, as it used to do, materials for building; the foundations\r\nof the city, the wall of Romulus, and the massive blocks on which the\r\nCapitol rests, being formed of this substance. Over this a later\r\nstratum was deposited called _tufa granolare_, consisting of a similar\r\nmechanical conglomerate of scoriæ, ashes, and other volcanic products,\r\nbut more porous and friable in texture. It is in this last formation,\r\nwhich is so soft that it can be easily hollowed out, and yet so solid\r\nthat it does not crumble, that the Catacombs are invariably found.\r\nThere is something that appeals strongly to the imagination in the\r\nfact that the early Christians should have formed the homes of their\r\ndead and the haunts of their faith in the deposit of the terrible\r\nvolcano and the stormy sea! The outbursts of the Alban volcanoes were\r\ncorrelated in God's scheme of providence with the outbursts of human\r\nfury long ages afterwards; and the one was prepared as a means of\r\ndefence from the other, by Him who maketh His ministers a flaming\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nThe Catacombs were specially excavated for Christian burial,--tombs\r\nbeneath the tombs of the Appian Way. Unlike the pagans, who burned the\r\nbodies of their dead, and deposited, as we have seen, the ashes in\r\ncinerary urns which took up but little space, the Christians buried\r\nthe bodies of their departed friends in rock-hewn sepulchres. They\r\nmust have derived this custom from the Jewish mode of interment; and\r\nthey would wish to follow in this the example of their Lord, who was\r\nlaid in an excavated tomb. Besides, it was abhorrent to their feelings\r\nto burn their dead. Their religion had taught them to value the body,\r\nwhich is an integral part of human nature, and has its own share in\r\nthe redemption of man. Their mode of sepulture therefore required\r\nlarger space; and as the Christians grew and multiplied, and more\r\nburials took place, they extended the subterranean passages and\r\ngalleries in every direction. It is computed that upwards of six\r\nmillions of the bodies of the early Christians were deposited in the\r\nCatacombs. The name which these rock-hewn sepulchres first received\r\nwas _cemeteries_, places of sleep; for the Christians looked upon\r\ntheir dead as only asleep, to be awakened by the trump of the\r\narchangel at the resurrection. And being used as burial-places, the\r\nCatacombs became the inalienable property of the Christians; for,\r\naccording to Roman law, land which had once been used for interment\r\nbecame _religiosus_, and could not be transferred for any other\r\npurpose. It was long supposed that the Catacombs were subsequently\r\nmade use of as places of abode, when persecution drove the Christians\r\nto seek the loneliest spots; but this idea has been dispelled by a\r\nmore careful examination of them. There can be no doubt, however, that\r\nthey were employed as places of religious meeting. Numerous\r\ninscriptions found in them touchingly record that no Christian worship\r\ncould be performed in the imperial city without the risk of discovery\r\nand death; and therefore the members of the Christian flock were\r\nobliged to meet for worship in these dreary vaults. The passages in\r\nsome places were expanded into large chambers, and there divine\r\nservice was performed; not only for the benefit of those who came to\r\nbury their dead, but also for those who resided in the city, and were\r\nChristians in secret.\r\n\r\nPassing from the roughly-paved road into the vineyard where the\r\nCatacombs of St. Calixtus are situated, the first objects that caught\r\nmy eye were the dark, gaunt ruins of a tomb and a chapel of the third\r\ncentury, now wreathed and garlanded with luxuriant ivy. Beside these\r\nruins I descended into the Catacombs by an ancient staircase, at the\r\nfoot of which my guide provided me with a long twisted wax taper,\r\ncalculated to last out my visit. A short distance from the entrance, I\r\ncame to a vestibule surrounded with loculi or rock-hewn graves. The\r\nwalls were plastered, and covered with rude inscriptions, scratched\r\nwith a pointed iron instrument. These were done by pilgrims and\r\ndevotees in later ages, who had come here--many of them from distant\r\nlands--to pay their respects at the graves of the saints and martyrs.\r\nTwo of these pilgrims, from the diocese of Salzburg, visited these\r\nCatacombs in the eighth century, and left behind an account of their\r\nvisit, which has afforded a valuable clue to Cavaliere de Rossi in his\r\nidentification of the chambers and graves. Passing from this open\r\nspace, I soon reached a sepulchral chapel, lined with the graves of\r\nthe earliest popes--many of them martyrs--who were buried here for\r\nabout a century, from the year 200 to the year 296 of our era. The\r\ngravestones of four of them have been found, with inscriptions in\r\nGreek. A beautiful marble tablet by Pope Damasus, who died in 384,\r\nstands where the altar of the chapel originally stood, and records the\r\npraises of the martyrs whose remains lay in the neighbouring chambers;\r\nending with a wish that he himself might be buried beside them, only\r\nhe feared that he was unworthy of the honour. This good Pope, like an\r\nolder \"Old Mortality,\" made it a labour of love, to which he\r\nconsecrated his life, to rediscover and adorn the tombs which had\r\nbeen hidden under an accumulation of earth and rubbish during the\r\nfearful persecution of Diocletian.\r\n\r\nFrom this chapel of the Popes I came through a narrow passage to a\r\nwider crypt, where the body of St. Cæcilia was laid after her\r\nmartyrdom in her own house in Rome, in the year 224. There is a rude\r\npainting of this saint on the wall, clothed with rich raiment, and\r\nadorned with the jewels befitting a Roman lady of high station. And at\r\nthe back of a niche, where a lamp used to burn before the shrine of\r\nthe saint, is painted a large head of our Saviour, with rays of glory\r\naround it shaped like a Greek cross. This is said to be the oldest\r\nrepresentation of our Lord in existence, and from it all our\r\nconventional portraits have been taken. Doubts have, however, been\r\nthrown upon this by others, who assert that all the paintings in this\r\nchamber are not older than the seventh century. After this, I wandered\r\non after my guide through innumerable narrow galleries hewn out of the\r\nsoft reddish-brown rock, and opening in all directions; all lined with\r\nhorizontal cavities for corpses, tier above tier, in which once were\r\ncrowded together old and young,--soldiers, martyrs, rich and poor\r\nmingling their dust together, as in life they had shared all things in\r\ncommon. Here social distinctions were abolished; side by side with the\r\nobscure and unknown slave were some of the most illustrious names of\r\nancient Rome. These shelves are now empty, for nearly all the bones\r\nand relics of the dead have been removed to different churches\r\nthroughout Europe. Even the inscriptions that were placed above each\r\ngrave--on marble tablets--have been taken away, and now line the walls\r\nof the museums of St. John Lateran and the Vatican. A few, however,\r\nremain in their place; and I know nothing more affecting than the\r\nstudy of these. For the most part, they are very short, containing\r\nonly the name and date; sometimes only an initial letter or a\r\nrudely-drawn cross, indicating that it was a time of sore trial, when\r\nsuch hurried obsequies were all that the imminent danger allowed.\r\nSometimes I came upon a larger record--such as, \"Thou sleepest sweetly\r\nin God;\" \"In the sleep of peace.\"\r\n\r\nBut the most touching of all the inscriptions were those which were\r\nscratched rudely in a few places on the walls by visitors to the tombs\r\nof their fellow-Christians. The survivors came often to weep over the\r\nrelics of the dead. Here a husband records the virtues of a beloved\r\nwife; there, a son invokes the precious memory of a pious father or\r\nmother; and all of them express their calm resignation and unshaken\r\nhope. One inscription especially struck me. It was very rude, and\r\nalmost obliterated, for seventeen hundred years had passed over it. It\r\nwas a husband's lamentation over a dead wife: \"O Sophronia! dear\r\nSophronia! thou _mayest_ live?--Thou _shalt_ live!\" How eloquently did\r\nthat rough, faded scrawl, over a long-forgotten grave, speak of the\r\nhuman fear that perhaps his wife was lost to him for ever--\"Thou\r\nmayest live?\" and of the noble faith that triumphed over it--\"Thou\r\n_shalt_ live!\" Nothing affects and astonishes one more in these\r\ninscriptions than this calm, assured confidence that death was but a\r\nprofound sleep,--a rest unspeakably grateful after such a weary life\r\nof awful suffering,--and that they should see their beloved ones\r\nagain. It was a literal realisation of the words of the Epistle to the\r\nHebrews: \"And others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that\r\nthey might obtain a better resurrection.\" They surrendered all that\r\nlife holds dear, and life itself, from loyalty to the God of truth,\r\nknowing whom they had believed, and persuaded that He would keep that\r\nwhich they had committed to Him against the great day. They made their\r\nfamily ties so loyal and sacred, that their human love, in the higher\r\nlove of Christ Jesus, endured for evermore. In many of the crypts, the\r\nemblems of martyrdom are roughly denoted by a sword, an axe, or by\r\nfaggots and fire. What sorrowful scenes must have taken place in\r\nthese dreary passages, as the mangled forms of parent, child, brother,\r\nor friend were stealthily brought in from the bloody games in the\r\nFlavian amphitheatre, or from the cruel tortures of the prison-house,\r\nto their last dark, narrow home along the very path I was now\r\ntreading!\r\n\r\nA number of rude paintings ornament the walls of the chapels, which\r\nrepeat over and over again the simple symbols of the Christian faith,\r\nand the touching stories of the Bible. The ark of Noah; Daniel in the\r\nlions' den; the miracle of Cana; the raising of Lazarus--are among the\r\nmost common of these frescoes. And they are deeply interesting, as\r\nshowing that down in these dim and dreary vaults, which presented such\r\na remarkable contrast to the lovely violet sky and the grand\r\narchitectural magnificence above ground, among men who cared little\r\nfor the things of time and sense, because life itself had not a\r\nmoment's security, were nevertheless nourished thoughts of ideal\r\nbeauty and unearthly grandeur, which afterwards yielded such glorious\r\nfruit in the Christian art of Italy. The frescoes of the Catacombs are\r\nthe feeble beginnings of an artistic inspiration which culminated in\r\nthe \"Last Supper\" of Leonardo da Vinci, and the \"Transfiguration\" of\r\nRaphael.\r\n\r\nThe anchor of hope, the olive-branch of peace, and the palm-branch as\r\nthe sign of victory and martyrdom, were seen everywhere. The fish,\r\nwhose Greek name is formed by the initial letters of the titles of our\r\nLord, was carved on the marble tablets and sarcophagi as the anagram\r\nof the Saviour; and an Orante, or female figure praying, was\r\nrepresented as the symbol of the Church. The most common of all the\r\nfigures, however, was that of the Good Shepherd carrying the lost\r\nsheep on His shoulders, or leaning on His staff while the sheep were\r\nfeeding around Him. And a most touching figure it is, when we think of\r\nthe circumstances of those who carved or painted it in these gloomy\r\naisles. It was into no green pastures, and beside no still waters,\r\nthat the Good Shepherd led His flock in those awful days, but into\r\nwaste and howling wildernesses, where their feet were bruised by the\r\nhard stones, and their flesh torn by the sharp thorns, and all the\r\nstorms of the world beat fiercely upon them. But still He was their\r\nGood Shepherd, and in the wilderness He spread a table for them, and\r\nin the valley of the shadow of death they feared no evil, for He was\r\nwith them, and His rod and staff comforted them.\r\n\r\nI wish I could express adequately the emotions which filled my breast\r\nwhile wandering through these Catacombs. Save for the feeble glimmer\r\nof my own and the guide's lamp, I was in total darkness,--a darkness\r\nthat might be felt. Not a sound broke the awful silence except the\r\necho of our footsteps in the hollow passages. Not a trace or a\r\nrecollection of life recalled me from the thought of absolute\r\nimpenetrable death around. Each passage seemed so like the other, and\r\nthe ramifications were so endless and bewildering, that but for the\r\npresence of my guide I should inevitably have lost myself. Horrible\r\nstories of persons who had gone astray in the inextricable maze, and\r\nwandering about in the empty gloom till they perished of exhaustion\r\nand starvation, recurred to my mind; and my imagination, intensified\r\nby the silence and darkness, vividly realised their sufferings. There\r\nis indeed no chill or damp in these labyrinths, and the atmosphere is\r\nmild and pleasant, but still the gloom was most oppressive. And yet a\r\ndeep gratitude fills the soul; for the light there shone in darkness,\r\nand it was this very darkness that preserved our religion, when it ran\r\nthe risk of being extinguished. These fearful subterranean passages\r\nwere the furrows in which were planted the first germs of the\r\nChristian religion,--in which they were long guarded in persecution as\r\nthe seed-corn under the frost-bound earth in winter, to spring up\r\nafterwards when summer smiled upon the world, and yield a glorious\r\nharvest to all nations.\r\n\r\nOn the opposite side of the Appian Way, in a vineyard, is the Catacomb\r\nof Pretextatus, which is almost as extensive as that of St. Calixtus,\r\nand hardly less interesting. It is especially remarkable for a large\r\nsquare crypt, inlaid with brick and plaster, and covered with very\r\nfine frescoes and arabesques of birds and foliage. The bodies of St.\r\nJanuarius, Agapetus, and Felicissimus, who suffered martyrdom in the\r\nyear 162, were interred in this Catacomb; and two churches, at a\r\nsubsequent period, were erected over it in honour of the three saints\r\nwho suffered martyrdom with St. Cæcilia. Recent explorations have\r\nbrought to light, in a separate part of this Catacomb, curious\r\npaintings and inscriptions which have been referred to the mysteries\r\nof Mithras--an Oriental worship of the Sun--introduced into Rome about\r\na century before Christ, and which was celebrated in caves. When\r\nChristianity became popular, and was threatening the overthrow of\r\npolytheism, an attempt was made to counteract its influence in the\r\nreign of Alexander Severus, who himself came from the East, by\r\norganising this worship. The two systems of religion became,\r\ntherefore, mixed up together for a while; and hence it is not uncommon\r\nto find in pagan sepulchres symbols and arrangements of a Christian\r\ncharacter, and in Christian Catacombs Mithraic features. The funeral\r\nmonuments of those who were converted to Christianity in the earliest\r\nages of the Church indicated the transition between the two religions.\r\nWe find upon their tombs pagan symbols, which ceased to be identified\r\nwith pagan worship, and became mere conventional ornaments. We have\r\nother evidences along the Appian Way of the eclectic revival of\r\npaganism at this time. When alluding to the classic stream of the\r\nAlmo, I spoke of the associations of the worship of Cybele. This\r\nnaturalistic cult was introduced from Phrygia, and its orgiastic rites\r\nand nameless infamies had a horrible fascination for an age of\r\ndecaying faith. And not far from the mounds of the Horatii and\r\nCuriatii there is a monument, probably of the age of Trajan, with a\r\nbas-relief portrait, dedicated to the memory of one _Usia Prima_, a\r\npriestess of Isis; this worship, with its painful initiations and\r\nsplendid ritual, being imported from Egypt in the second century. But\r\nalthough this Neo-paganism appealed more to the passions of men than\r\nthe sunny humanistic worship of older times, and for a time inspired\r\nthe most frenzied enthusiasm, it failed utterly to resuscitate the\r\ndecaying corpse of the old religion. Great Pan was hopelessly dead!\r\n\r\nAt a short distance on the same side of the road is the Catacomb of\r\nSts. Nereus and Achilles, which contained the remains of these saints,\r\nand are interesting to us as the most ancient Christian cemetery in\r\nthe world. The masonry of the vestibule is in the best style of Roman\r\nbrickwork; and the frescoes on its walls, representing Christ and His\r\napostles, the Good Shepherd, Orpheus, Elijah, etc., indicate a period\r\nof high artistic taste. This Catacomb contains the oldest\r\nrepresentation extant of the Virgin and Child receiving the homage of\r\nthe Wise men from the East, supposed to date from the end of the\r\nsecond century, and was often made use of in support of Roman\r\nMariolatry. Several days might be profitably spent by the antiquarian\r\nin investigating the contents of the different tiers of galleries;\r\nwhile the geologist would find matter for interesting speculation in\r\nthe partial intrusion of the older lithoid tufa here and there into\r\nthe softer and more recent volcanic deposits in which the passages are\r\nexcavated, and in which numerous decomposing crystals of leucite may\r\nbe observed. On the same side of the way, farther on, is the Jewish\r\nCatacomb, the tombs of which bear Jewish symbols, especially the\r\nseven-branched golden candlestick, and are inscribed, not with the\r\nsecular names and occupations of the occupants, but with their sacred\r\nnames, as office-bearers of the synagogue, rulers, scribes, etc. The\r\ninscriptions are not in Hebrew, but in Greek letters. It is supposed\r\nthat in this Catacomb were interred the bodies of the Jews who were\r\nbanished to the valley of Egeria by Domitian.\r\n\r\nAbout a quarter of a mile beyond the Catacombs you come to a descent,\r\nwhere there is a wide open space with a pillar in the centre, and\r\nbehind it the natural rock of a peculiarly glowing red colour,\r\novergrown with masses of ivy, wall-flower, and hawthorn just coming\r\ninto blossom. Below the road, on the right, is a kind of piazza,\r\nshaded by a grove of funereal cypresses; and here is the church of St.\r\nSebastian, one of the seven great basilicas which pilgrims visited to\r\nobtain the remission of their sins. It was founded by Constantine, on\r\nthe site of the house and garden of the pious widow Lucina, who buried\r\nthere the body of St. Sebastian after his martyrdom. This saint was a\r\nGaulish soldier in the Roman army, who, professing Christianity, was\r\nput to death by order of Diocletian. The body of the saint is said to\r\nrepose under one of the altars, marked by a marble statue of him lying\r\ndead, pierced with silver arrows, designed by Bernini. The present\r\nedifice was entirely rebuilt by Cardinal Scipio Borghese; and nothing\r\nremains of the ancient basilica save the six granite columns of the\r\nportico, which were in all likelihood taken from some old pagan\r\ntemple. It was from the nave of this church that the only Catacomb\r\nwhich used to be visited by pilgrims was entered; all the other\r\nCatacombs which have since been opened being at that time blocked up\r\nand unknown. Indeed it was to the subterranean galleries under this\r\nchurch that the name of Catacomb was originally applied.\r\n\r\nIn the valley beneath St. Sebastian, on the left, is a large\r\nenclosure, covered with the greenest turf, and reminding one more, by\r\nits softness and compactness, of an English park than anything I had\r\nseen about Rome. Here are the magnificent ruins of what was long known\r\nas the Circus of Caracalla; but later investigations have proved that\r\nthe circus was erected in honour of Romulus, the son of the Emperor\r\nMaxentius, in the year 311. It is the best preserved of all the\r\nancient Roman circuses, and affords an excellent clue to the\r\narrangements of such places for chariot races and the accommodation of\r\nthe spectators. The external walls run on unbroken for about a\r\nquarter of a mile. In many places the vaults supporting the seats\r\nstill remain. The spina in the centre marking the course of the races,\r\non either end of which stood the two Egyptian obelisks which now adorn\r\nthe Piazza Navona and the Piazza del Popolo, though grass-grown, can\r\nbe easily defined; and the towers flanking the extremities, where the\r\njudges sat, and the triumphal gate through which the victors passed,\r\nare almost entire. It would not be difficult, with such aids to the\r\nimagination, to conjure up the splendid games that used to take place\r\nwithin that vast enclosure; the chariots of green, blue, white, and\r\nred driving furiously seven times round the course, the emperor and\r\nall his nobles sitting in the places of honour, looking on with\r\nenthusiasm, and the victor coming in at the goal, and the shouts and\r\nexclamations of the excited multitude. On the elevated ground behind\r\nthe circus is a fringe of olive-trees, with a line of feathery elms\r\nbeyond; and rising over all, the purple background of the Sabine and\r\nAlban hills. It is a lonely enough spot now; and the gentle hand of\r\nspring clothes the naked walls with a perfect garden of wild flowers,\r\nand softens with the greenest and tenderest turf the spots trodden by\r\nthe feet of so many thousands. In the immediate vicinity of the circus\r\nare extensive ruins, visible and prominent objects from the road,\r\nconsisting of large fragments of walls and apses, dispersed among the\r\nvineyards and enclosures.\r\n\r\nBy far the best-known monument on the Appian Way is the Tomb of\r\nCæcilia Metella. It is a conspicuous landmark in the wide waste, and\r\ncatches the eye at a long distance from many points of view. It is as\r\nfamiliar a feature in paintings of the Campagna almost as the Claudian\r\nAqueduct. This celebrity it owes to its immense size, its wonderful\r\nstate of preservation, and above all to the genius of Lord Byron, who\r\nhas made it the theme of some of the most elegant and touching stanzas\r\nin _Childe Harold_. Nothing can be finer than the appearance of this\r\ncircular tower in the afternoon, when the red level light of sunset,\r\nstriking full upon it, brings out the rich warm glow of its yellow\r\ntravertine stones in striking relief against the monotonous green of\r\nthe Campagna. It is built on a portion of rising ground caused by a\r\ncurrent of lava which descended from the Alban volcano during some\r\nprehistoric eruption, and stopped short here, forming the quarries on\r\nthe left side of the road which supply most of the paving-stone of\r\nmodern Rome. The Appian Way was here lowered several feet below the\r\noriginal level, in order to diminish the acclivity; and the mausoleum\r\nwas consequently raised upon a substructure of unequal height\r\ncorresponding with the inclination of the plane of ascent. It was\r\noriginally cased with marble slabs, but these were stripped off during\r\nthe middle ages for making lime; and Pope Clement XII. completed the\r\ndevastation by removing large blocks which formed the basement, in\r\norder to construct the picturesque fountain of Trevi. A large portion\r\nof the Doric marble frieze, however, still remains, on which are\r\nsculptured bas-reliefs of rams' heads, festooned with garlands of\r\nflowers. Usually the bas-reliefs are supposed to represent bulls'\r\nheads; and the name of Capo de Bove (the \"head of the ox\"), by which\r\nthe monument has long been known to the common people, is said to be\r\nderived from these ornaments. But a careful examination will convince\r\nany one that they are in reality rams' heads; and the vulgar name of\r\nthe tomb was obviously borrowed from the armorial bearings of the\r\nGaetani family, consisting of an ox's head, affixed prominently upon\r\nit when it served them as a fortress in the thirteenth century. Pope\r\nBoniface VIII., a member of this family, added the curious battlements\r\nat the top, which seem so slight and airy in comparison with the\r\nsevere solidity of the rest of the structure, and are but a poor\r\nsubstitute for the massive conical roof which originally covered the\r\ntomb. Nature has done her utmost for nigh two thousand years to bring\r\nback this monument to her own bosom, but she has been foiled in all\r\nher attempts,--the travertine blocks of its exterior, though fitted to\r\neach other without cement, being as smooth and even in their courses\r\nof masonry as when first constructed, and almost as free from\r\nweather-stains as if they had newly been taken from the quarry. Only\r\non the broad summit, where medieval Vandals broke down the noble pile\r\nand desecrated it by their own inferior workmanship, has nature been\r\nable to effect a lodgment; and in the breaches of this fortress, which\r\nis but a thing of yesterday as compared with the monument, and yet is\r\nfar more ruinous, she has planted bushes, trees, and thick festoons of\r\nivy, as if laying her quiet finger upon the angry passions of man, and\r\nobliterating the memory of his evil deeds by her own fair and smiling\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\nThe sepulchral vault in the interior was not opened till the time of\r\nPaul III., about 1540, when a beautiful marble sarcophagus, adorned\r\nwith bas-reliefs of the chase, was found in it, which is supposed to\r\nbe that which stands at the present day in the court of the Palazzo\r\nFarnese. This is likely to be true, for it is well known that this\r\nPope, who was a member of the Farnese family, unscrupulously despoiled\r\nancient Rome of many of its finest works of art in order to build and\r\nadorn his new palace. A golden urn containing ashes is said to have\r\nbeen discovered at the same time; but if so, it has long since\r\ndisappeared. On a marble panel below the frieze an inscription in bold\r\nletters informs us that this is the tomb of Cæcilia Metella, daughter\r\nof Quintus Metellus,--who obtained the sobriquet of _Creticus_ for his\r\nconquest of Crete,--and wife of Crassus. She belonged to one of the\r\nmost haughty aristocratic families of ancient Rome, whose members at\r\nsuccessive intervals occupied the highest positions in the state, and\r\nseveral of whom were decreed triumphs by the senate on account of\r\ntheir success in war. Her husband was surnamed _Dives_ on account of\r\nhis enormous wealth. He is said to have possessed a fortune equal to a\r\nmillion and a half pounds sterling; and to have given an\r\nentertainment to the whole Roman people in a time of scarcity, besides\r\ndistributing to each family a quantity of corn sufficient to last\r\nthree months. Along with Julius Cæsar and Pompey, he formed the famous\r\nfirst Triumvirate. While the richest, he seems, notwithstanding the\r\nabove-mentioned act of munificence, to have been one of the meanest of\r\nthe Romans. He had no steady political principle; he was actuated by\r\nbitter jealousy towards his colleagues and rivals; and that\r\nunsuccessful expedition which he undertook against the Parthians, in\r\nflagrant violation of a treaty made with them by Sulla and renewed by\r\nPompey, and which has stamped his memory with incapacity and shame,\r\nwas prompted by an insatiable greed for the riches of the East. On the\r\nfield he occupied himself entirely in amassing fresh treasures, while\r\nhis troops were neglected. The manner of his death, after the defeat\r\nand loss of the greater part of his army, was characteristic of his\r\nruling passion. Tempted to seek an interview with the Parthian general\r\nby the offer of the present of a horse with splendid trappings, he was\r\ncut down when in the act of mounting into the saddle. His body was\r\ncontemptuously buried in some obscure spot by the enemy, and his hands\r\nand head were sent to the king, who received the ghastly trophies\r\nwhile seated at the nuptial feast of his daughter, and ordered in\r\nsavage irony molten gold to be poured down the severed throat,\r\nexclaiming, \"Sate thyself now with the metal of which in life thou\r\nwert so fond.\"\r\n\r\nThere is one incident connected with this most disastrous campaign\r\nupon which the imagination loves to dwell. Publius, the younger son of\r\nCrassus, born of the woman who lay in this tomb before us, after\r\nearning great distinction in Gaul as Cæsar's legate, accompanied his\r\nfather to the East, and was much beloved on account of his noble\r\nqualities and his feats of bravery against the enemy. While\r\nendeavouring to repulse the last fierce charge of the Parthians, he\r\nwas wounded severely by an arrow, and finding himself unable to\r\nextricate his troops, rather than desert them he ordered his\r\nsword-bearer to slay him. When the news of his son's fall reached the\r\naged father, the old Roman spirit blazed up for a moment in him, and\r\nhe exhorted his soldiers \"not to be disheartened by a loss that\r\nconcerned himself only.\" In this last triumph of a nobler nature he\r\ndisappears from our view; and he who built this magnificent monument\r\nto the mother of his gallant son had himself no monument. More\r\nfortunate than her husband, whose evil manners live in brass,--less\r\nfortunate than her son, whose virtues have been handed down for the\r\nadmiration of posterity,--Cæcilia Metella has left no record of her\r\nexistence beyond her name. All else has been swallowed up by the\r\noblivion of ages. Whether her husband raised this colossal trophy of\r\nthe dust to commemorate his own pride of wealth, or his devoted love\r\nfor her, we know not. He achieved his object; but he has given to his\r\nwife only the mockery of immortality. The substance has gone beyond\r\nrecall, and but the shadow, the mere empty name, remains.\r\n\r\nBuilt up against this monument are the remains of the castle in which\r\nthe Gaetani family long maintained their feudal warfare, with\r\nfragments of marble sculpture taken from the tomb incorporated into\r\nthe plain brick walls. And on the other side of the road, in a\r\nbeautiful meadow, covered with soft green grass, are the ruins of a\r\nroofless Gothic chapel, showing little more than a few bare walls and\r\ngables built of dark lava stones, with traces of pointed windows in\r\nthem, and the spring of the groined arches of the roof. Like the\r\nfortress, the chapel has few or no architectural features of interest.\r\nIt is very unlike any other church in Italy, and reminds one of the\r\ncountry churches of England. What led the Gaetanis to adopt this\r\nforeign style of ecclesiastical architecture is a circumstance\r\nunexplained. Altogether it is a most incongruous group of objects that\r\nare here clustered together--a tomb, a fortress, and a church--and\r\naffords a curious illustration of the bizarre condition of society at\r\nthe time. An extraordinary echo repeats here every sound entrusted to\r\nit with the utmost distinctness. It doubtless multiplied the wailings\r\nof the mourners who brought to this spot two thousand years ago the\r\nashes of the dead; it sent back the rude sounds of warfare which\r\ndisturbed the peace of the tomb in the middle ages; and now it haunts\r\nthe spot like the voice of the past, \"informing the solitude,\" and\r\ngiving a response to each new-comer according to his mood.\r\n\r\nBeyond the tomb of Cæcilia Metella the Appian Way becomes more\r\ninteresting and beautiful. The high walls which previously shut in the\r\nroad on either side now disappear, and nothing separates it from the\r\nCampagna but a low dyke of loose stones. The traveller obtains an\r\nuninterrupted view of the immense melancholy plain, which stretches\r\naway to the horizon with hardly a single tree to relieve the\r\ndesolation. Here and there on the waste surface are fragments of ruins\r\nwhich speak to the heart, by their very muteness, more suggestively\r\nthan if their historical associations were fully known. The mystic\r\nlight from a sky which over this place seems ever to brood with a sad\r\nsmile more touching than tears, falls upon the endless arches of the\r\nClaudian Aqueduct that remind one, as Ruskin has finely said, of a\r\nfuneral procession departing from a nation's grave. The afternoon sun\r\npaints them with ruby splendours, and gleams vividly upon the\r\npicturesque vegetation which a thousand springs have sown upon their\r\ncrumbling sides. They lead the eye on to the Alban Hills, which form\r\non the horizon a fitting frame to the great picture, tender-toned,\r\nwith delicate pearly and purple shadows clothing every cliff and\r\nhollow, like \"harmonies of music turned to shape.\"\r\n\r\nI shall never forget my first walk over this enchanted ground. The day\r\nwas warm and bright, though a little breeze, like the murmur of a\r\nchild's sleep, occasionally stirred the languid calm. April had just\r\ncome in; but in this Southern clime spring, having no storms or\r\nfrosts to fear, lingers in a strange way and unfolds, with slow,\r\npatient tenderness, her beauties; not like our Northern spring, which\r\nrushes to verdure and bloom as soon as the winter snows have\r\ndisappeared. And hence, though the few trees along the road had only\r\nput forth their first leaves, tender and flaccid as butterfly's wings,\r\nthe grass was ready to be cut down and was thickly starred with wild\r\nflowers. Horace of old said that one could not travel rapidly along\r\nthe Appian Way, on account of the number and variety of its objects of\r\ninterest; and the same remark holds good at the present day. It would\r\ntake months to go over in detail all its wonderful relics of the past.\r\nAt every step you are arrested by something that opens up a\r\nfascinating vista into the old family life of the imperial city. At\r\nevery step you \"set your foot upon some reverend history.\" From\r\nmorning to sunset I lingered on this haunted path, and tried to enter\r\ninto sympathy with old-world sorrows that have left behind no\r\nchronicles save these silent stones. It is indeed a path sacred to\r\nmeditation! One has there an overpowering sense of waste--a depressing\r\nfeeling of vanity. On every side are innumerable tokens of a vast\r\nexpenditure of human toil, and love, and sorrow; and it seems as if it\r\nhad been all thrown away. For two miles and a half from the tomb of\r\nCæcilia Metella I counted fifty-three tombs on the right and\r\nforty-eight on the left. The margin of the road on either side is\r\nstrewn with fragments of hewn marble, travertine, and peperino. Broken\r\ntablets, retaining a few letters of the epitaphs of the dead;\r\nmutilated statues and alto-relievos; drums and capitals of pillars; a\r\nhand or a foot, or a fold of marble drapery,--every form and variety\r\nof sculpture, the mere crumbs that had fallen from a profuse feast of\r\nartistic beauty, which nobody considers it worth while to pick up, lie\r\nmouldering among the grass. At frequent intervals, facing the road,\r\nyou see with mournful interest the exposed interiors of tombs, showing\r\nthat beautiful and curious _opus reticulatum_, or reticulated\r\narrangement of bricks or tufa blocks, which is so characteristic of\r\nthe imperial period, and rows upon rows of neat pigeon-holes in the\r\nbrickwork, which contained the cinerary urns, all robbed of their\r\ntreasures, their tear-bottles, and even their bones. Ruthless popes\r\nand princes have done their best during all the intervening ages to\r\ndestroy the monuments by taking away for their own uses the marble and\r\nhewn stone which encased them, leaving behind only the inner core of\r\nbrick and small stones imbedded in mortar which was never meant to be\r\nseen. Pitying hands have lately endeavoured to atone for this\r\ndesecration by lifting here and there out of the rubbish heap on which\r\nthey were thrown some affecting group of family portraits, some choice\r\nspecimens of delicate architecture, some mutilated panel on which the\r\nstern hard features of a Roman senator look out upon you, and placing\r\nthem in a prominent position to attract attention. But though they\r\nhave endeavoured to build up the fragments of the tombs into some\r\nsemblance of their former appearance, the resuscitation is even more\r\nmelancholy than was the former ruin. Their efforts at restoration are\r\nonly the very graves of graves. In some places a side path leading off\r\nthe main road to a tomb has been uncovered, paved with the original\r\nlava-blocks as fresh as when the last mourner retired from it, casting\r\n\"a lingering look behind;\" but it leads now only to a shapeless heap\r\nof brick, or to the empty site of a monument that has been razed to\r\nthe very foundations.\r\n\r\nOne piece of marble sculpture especially arrests the eye, and awakens\r\na chord of feeling in the most callous heart. It represents one of\r\nthose _Imagines Clipeatæ_ which the ancient Romans were so fond of\r\nsculpturing in their temples or upon their tombs; a clam shell or\r\nshield with the bust of a man and a woman carved in relief within it,\r\nthe hand of the one fondly embracing the neck of the other. Below is a\r\nlong Latin inscription, telling that this is the tomb of a brother\r\nand sister who were devotedly attached to each other. Who this soror\r\nand frater were, there is no record to tell. All subsidiary details of\r\ntheir lives have been allowed to pass away with the other decorations\r\nof the tomb, leaving behind this beautiful expression of household\r\naffection in full and lasting relief. I felt drawn more closely to the\r\ndistant ages by this little carving than by anything else. The huge\r\nmonuments around weighed down my spirit to the earth. The very effort\r\nto secure immortality by the massiveness of these tombs defeated its\r\nown object. They spoke only of dust to dust and ashes to ashes; but\r\nthat little glimpse into the simple love of simple hearts in the\r\nfar-off past lifted me above all the decays of the sepulchre. It\r\nassured me that our deepest heart-affections are the helpers of our\r\nhighest hopes, and the instinctive guarantees of a life to come. Love\r\ncreates its own immortality; for \"love is love for evermore.\"\r\n\r\nAlong this avenue of death nothing can be more striking than the\r\nprofusion of life. It seems as if all the vitality of the many buried\r\ngenerations had there passed into the fuller life of nature. You can\r\ntrace the street of tombs into the far distance, not only by the ruins\r\nthat line it on both sides, but also by its borders of grass of a\r\ndarker green and greater luxuriance than the pale, short, sickly\r\nverdure of the Campagna; just as you can trace the course of a\r\nmoorland stream along the heather by the brighter vegetation which its\r\nown waters have created. Myriads of flowers gleam in their own\r\natmosphere of living light, like jewels among the rich herbage, so\r\nthat the feet can hardly be set down without crushing scores of them:\r\nthe _Orchis rubra_ with its splendid spike of crimson blossoms, the\r\nbee and spider orchises in great variety, whose flowers mimic the\r\ninsects after whom they are named, sweet-scented alyssum, golden\r\nbuttercups and hawkweeds, Roman daisies, larger and taller than the\r\nEnglish ones, with the bold wide-eyed gaze you see in the Roman\r\npeasant-girls, scarlet poppies glowing in a sunshine of their own,\r\nlike flames in the heart of a furnace, vetches bright azure and pale\r\nyellow, dark blue hyacinths, pink geraniums, and \"moonlit spires of\r\nasphodel,\" suggestive of the flowery fields of the immortals. My\r\nfootsteps along the dusty road continually disturbed serpents that\r\nwriggled away in long ripples of motion among the tall spears of the\r\ngrass; while green and golden lizards, sunning themselves on the hot\r\nstones, disappeared into their holes with a quick rustling sound at my\r\napproach. The air was musical with a perfect chorus of larks, whose\r\njubilant song soared above all sorrow and death to heaven's own gate;\r\nand now and then a tawny hawk sailed swiftly across the horizon. Huge\r\nplants of gray mullein towered here and there above the sward, whose\r\nflannel-like leaves afforded a snug shelter to great quantities of\r\nwasps just recovering from their winter torpor. On the very tombs\r\nthemselves there was a lavish adornment of vegetable life: snow-white\r\ndrifts of hawthorn and honeysuckle wreaths waved on the summits of\r\nthose on which a sufficient depth of soil had lodged; the wild\r\ndog-rose spread its thorny bushes and passionate-coloured crimson\r\nblooms as a fence around others; and even on the barest of them\r\nnothing could exceed the wealth of orange lichens that redeemed their\r\npoverty and gilded their nakedness with frescoes of fadeless beauty.\r\nOn some of the rugged masses of masonry grew large hoary tufts of the\r\nstrange roccella or orchil-weed, which yields the famous purple\r\ndye--with which, in all likelihood, the robes of the Cæsars were\r\ncoloured--and which gave wealth, rank, and name to one princely\r\nItalian family, the Rucellai. Over the desolate tombs of those who\r\nwore the imperial purple, this humble lichen, that yielded the\r\nsplendid hue, spread its gray hoar-frost of vegetation.\r\n\r\nI have already spoken of the solitude of the Campagna; but this part\r\nof the Appian Way, leading through it, is exceptionally lonely. It\r\nmight as well have led over an American prairie or Asiatic steppe on\r\nwhich the foot of man had never intruded. You see along the white\r\nreaches of the road at a little distance what looks like a cluster of\r\nhouses overshadowed by some tall umbrella pine, with all the signs of\r\nhuman life apparently about them; but, as you come near, the sight\r\nresolves itself into a mere mass of ruins. The mirage of life turns\r\nout to be a tomb--nay, the ruin of a tomb! A carriage full of visitors\r\nmay, perhaps, be seen at long intervals, their spirits sobered by the\r\nmelancholy that broods over the scene; or a lumbering cart, laden with\r\nwine-casks from Ariccia or Albano, drawn by the soft-eyed\r\nmouse-coloured oxen of the Campagna, startles the echoes, and betrays\r\nits course by the clouds of dust which it raises. There are no sights\r\nor sounds of rural toil in the fields on either side of the way. Only\r\na solitary shepherd, with his picturesque cloak, accompanied by two or\r\nthree vicious-looking dogs, meets you; or, perhaps, you come\r\nunexpectedly upon an artist seated on a tomb and busy sketching the\r\nlandscape. For hours you may have the scene all to yourself. Even\r\nRome, from this distance, looks like a city of dreams! Its walls and\r\ndomes have disappeared behind the misty green veil of the horizon; and\r\nonly the colossal statues of the apostles on the top of the church of\r\nS. John Lateran stand out in a halo of golden light, and seem to\r\nstretch forth their hands to welcome the approaching pilgrim.\r\n\r\nIt is well known to historians that the villa of Seneca, in which he\r\nput himself to death by command of Nero, stood near the fourth\r\nmilestone on the Appian Way. The circumstances of his death are\r\nexceedingly sad. Wishing to get rid of his former tutor, who had\r\nbecome obnoxious to him, the bloodthirsty emperor first attempted to\r\npoison him; and when this failed, he accused him, along with his\r\nnephew the poet Lucan and several others, of being concerned in a\r\nconspiracy against his life. This accusation was false; but it served\r\nthe purpose of bringing Seneca within reach of his vengeance, under a\r\ncolour of justice. A tribune with a cohort of soldiers was sent to\r\nintimate his fate to the philosopher; allowing him to execute the\r\nsentence of death upon himself by whatever means he preferred. Seneca\r\nwas at supper with his wife Paulina and two friends when the fatal\r\nmessage came. Without any sign of alarm he rose and opened the veins\r\nof his arms and legs, having bade farewell to his friends and embraced\r\nhis wife; and while the blood, impoverished by old age, ebbed slowly\r\nfrom him, he continued to comfort his friends and exhort them to a\r\nlife of integrity. The last words of one so justly renowned were taken\r\ndown, and in the time of Tacitus the record was still extant. We\r\nshould value much these interesting memorials; but they are now\r\nirrecoverably lost. His wife, refusing to live without him, also\r\nendeavoured to bleed herself to death; but she was recovered by order\r\nof Nero almost at the last moment. She remained pale and emaciated\r\never after from having followed her husband more than half-way on the\r\nroad to death.\r\n\r\nNo trace of the villa where this pathetic tragedy took place can now\r\nbe seen; but near the spot where it must have stood, close beside the\r\nroad, is a marble bas-relief of the death of Atys, the son of Croesus,\r\nkilled in the chase by Adrastus, placed upon a modern pedestal; and\r\nthis is supposed to have formed part of the tomb of Seneca. There is\r\nno inscription; probably none would be allowed during the lifetime of\r\nNero; and we know that his body was burned privately without any of\r\nthe usual ceremonies. But if this fragment of sculpture be genuine,\r\nthe well-known classic story which it tells was an appropriate\r\nmemorial of one who perished in the midst of the greatest prosperity.\r\nNo one who is familiar with the history of this \"seeker after God,\"\r\nthis philosopher who was a pagan John the Baptist in the severity and\r\npurity of his mode of life, and in the position which he occupied on\r\nthe border-line between paganism and Christianity, and who left behind\r\nhim some of the noblest utterances of antiquity, can gaze upon this\r\ninteresting bas-relief without being deeply moved. It speaks\r\neloquently of the little dependence to be placed upon the favour of\r\nprinces; and it points a powerful moral that has been repeatedly\r\nenforced in sacred as well as profane history, that he who becomes the\r\naccomplice of another in crime, strikes, by that complicity, the\r\ndeath-blow of friendship, and makes himself more hated than even the\r\nvictim of the crime had been. When Seneca sanctioned, and then\r\ndefended on political grounds, the matricide of Nero, from that moment\r\nhis own doom was sealed. Over the former \"guide, philosopher, and\r\nfriend,\" the shadow of this guilty secret rested, and it deepened and\r\ndarkened until the pupil embrued his hands in the blood of his\r\nteacher. This touching fragment of sculpture is all that now remains\r\nof the earthly pomp of one who at one time stood on the very highest\r\nsummit of human wisdom. There is no likelihood that he ever met the\r\nApostle Paul during his residence in the imperial city, or learned\r\nfrom him any of those precepts that are so wonderfully Christian in\r\ntheir spirit and even words; although an early Christian forger\r\nthought it worth while to fabricate a supposititious correspondence\r\nbetween them. The only link of connection between them was the\r\nproblematical one that St. Paul, with his wide sympathies, may have\r\ngazed with interest upon Seneca's villa, as it was pointed out to him\r\non his journey to Rome; and that he was on one occasion dragged as a\r\nprisoner into the presence of Seneca's elder brother, that Gallio who\r\ndismissed the charge and the accusers with contempt.\r\n\r\nPassing two massive fragments of a wall, which are supposed to have\r\nformed part of a small temple of Jupiter, beside which numerous\r\nChristians suffered martyrdom, we come, at the fifth milestone, to a\r\nspot associated with one of those poetical legends which occur in the\r\nearly annals of all nations, and whose hold upon the minds of men is\r\nitself an historic truth. Here was the boundary between the territory\r\nof Rome and that of Alba. Here was situated the entrenchment called\r\nthe Cluilian Dyke, where Hannibal encamped, and where previously the\r\nRoman and Alban armies were drawn up in battle array, when it was\r\nagreed that the quarrel between them should be settled by three\r\nchampions chosen from each side. Every one knows the story of the\r\nHoratii and the Curiatii: how these hapless brothers and cousins\r\nfought in sight of both armies with a bravery worthy of the stake; and\r\nhow, at length, when two of the Roman heroes were slain, and all the\r\nAlbans were wounded, the third Roman, who was unhurt, feigned to fly,\r\nand thus separating his enemies, who followed him as well as their\r\nfailing strength would permit, easily despatched them one after the\r\nother, and thus gained the victory for the Roman cause. This terrible\r\ntragedy, which terminated the independent existence of the Alban\r\npower, took place in the fields around here; and on the right-hand\r\nside of the road are three huge circular mounds, overgrown with long\r\nrich grass, planted with tall cypress and ilex trees, and surrounded\r\nat the foot with a wall of huge peperino blocks, which antiquarians\r\nhave determined to be the tombs of the five slaughtered\r\ncombatants--the farther mound being that of the two Horatii, the\r\nsecond that of one of the Curiatii, and the third that of the other\r\ntwo Curiatii. These tombs are situated exactly where we should have\r\nexpected to find them from the description of Livy; and they are\r\nevidently of far older date than any of the neighbouring tombs of the\r\nimperial period. Their form and construction carry us back in\r\nimagination to the earliest days of Rome, when Etruscan architecture\r\nwas universally adopted as a model. For more than twenty-five\r\ncenturies the huge tent-like mounds have stood, so strikingly\r\ndifferent in character from all the other sepulchral monuments of the\r\nAppian Way; preserved by the reverential care of successive\r\ngenerations. The modern Romans have not been behind the ancient in the\r\npride with which they have regarded these monuments. They have\r\nplanted them with the splendid cypress-trees which now add so much to\r\ntheir picturesqueness, and annually repair the ravages of time. I\r\nclimbed up the steep sides through the long slippery grass to the\r\nsummits of two of the mounds, and had a grand view of the whole scene\r\nof the tragic story, bathed in the dim misty light which always broods\r\nover the melancholy Campagna like the spectral presence of the past.\r\nThe sunshine strove in vain to gild the dark shadows which the\r\ncypresses threw over the mound at my feet, and the lonely wind wailed\r\nwildly through their closely-huddled shivering branches around me.\r\n\r\nOn the opposite side of the road, beyond the earthen mounds of the\r\nHoratii and Curiatii, a large mass of picturesque ruins covers the\r\nCampagna for a considerable distance. The peasants persist in calling\r\nthis spot _Roma Vecchia_, under the idea that ancient Rome stood\r\nthere, and that these ruins are the remains of the city. Antiquarians,\r\nhowever, are agreed that the ruins belong to the large suburban villa\r\nof the Quintilii, one of the noblest and most virtuous families of\r\nancient Rome. One member, the celebrated rhetorician Quintilian, was\r\nthe first who enjoyed the regular salary allotted by Vespasian to\r\nthose who provided a solid education for the upper classes. In the\r\ntime of the Emperor Commodus the villa was owned by two brothers of\r\nthe Quintilian family, Maximus and Condianus, whose fraternal love is\r\nas well known almost as the friendship of Damon and Pythias. They were\r\ninseparable in all their pursuits and pleasures; they shared this\r\nvilla and the surrounding property together; they composed a treatise\r\nin common, some fragments of which still survive. They were raised\r\ntogether to the consular dignity by Marcus Aurelius, who greatly\r\nvalued their virtue and their mutual attachment, and were entrusted\r\ntogether with the civil government of Greece. They were both falsely\r\naccused of taking part in a plot against the emperor's life; and\r\nCommodus, who coveted their property, had them both put to death\r\ntogether. The tyrant then took possession of their villa, which became\r\nas notorious for the evil deeds done in it as it was famous before for\r\nthe virtuous life of its owners. Here Commodus, the base son of a\r\nheroic father, practised those lusts and brutalities which have\r\nbranded his name as that of one of the most unmitigated monsters that\r\never stained the pages of history. It was here that the\r\npeople--exasperated by their sufferings through fire and famine, by\r\nthe open sale of justice and all public offices, and by the blood shed\r\nin the streets by the prætorian cavalry--surrounded the villa, and\r\ndemanded the head of Cleander, a Phrygian slave whom Commodus had\r\nplaced at the helm of state because he pandered to his master's vices,\r\nand gratified him with rich presents obtained by the vilest means. At\r\nthe entreaties of his sister and his favourite concubine, the emperor\r\nsacrificed his minister, who was with him at the time, sharing in his\r\nguilty pleasures; and threw out, from one of the windows of the villa,\r\nthe bloody head among the crowd, who gratified their vengeance by\r\ntossing it about like a football. Here, too, the wretched emperor\r\nhimself was first poisoned by a cup of wine given to him by his\r\nfavourite mistress Marcia, on his return weary and thirsty from the\r\nColosseum; and then, as the poison operated too slowly, was strangled\r\nin his heavy drugged sleep by his favourite gladiator Narcissus. One\r\ncould not look upon the bare masses of ruins around without thinking\r\nof the terrible orgies that took place there, and of the shout of\r\nenthusiastic joy when the news reached Rome that the detested tyrant\r\nwas no more, and the empire was free to breathe again. The fate of\r\nAhab, who coveted the vineyard of Naboth, overtook him; and but for\r\nthe interference of his successor, the maddened populace would have\r\ndragged his corpse through the streets and flung it into the Tiber.\r\n\r\nA very extraordinary tomb arrests the attention near the ruins of this\r\nvilla. It looks like an inverted pyramid, or a huge architectural\r\nmushroom. This appearance has been given to the monument by the\r\nremoval of the large blocks of stone which formed the basement,\r\nleaving the massive superincumbent weight to be supported on a very\r\nnarrow stalk of conglomerate masonry. It is a striking proof of the\r\nextraordinary solidity and tenacity of Roman architecture, defying the\r\nlaws of gravitation. It is called the sepulchre of the Metelli, the\r\nfamily of Cæcilia Metella; but this is a mere guess, as there is no\r\nrecord or inscription to identify it. Next to this singular monument\r\nare the remains of a tomb which must be exceedingly interesting to\r\nevery classical scholar. The inscription indicates that it is the tomb\r\nof Quintus Cæcilius, whose nephew and adopted son, Titus Pomponius\r\nAtticus, as Cornelius Nepos tells us, was buried in it. This\r\ncelebrated Roman knight was descended in a direct line from Numa\r\nPompilius. Withdrawing from the civil discords of Rome, he took up his\r\nabode in Athens, where he devoted himself to literary and philosophic\r\npursuits and acquired a knowledge of the Greek language so perfect\r\nthat he could not be distinguished from a native. At the Greek\r\ncapital, the then university of the world, he secured the devoted\r\nfriendship of his fellow-student Cicero, whose brother was afterwards\r\nmarried to his sister; and to this intimacy we owe the largest portion\r\nof Cicero's unrivalled letters, in which he describes his inmost\r\nfeelings, as well as the events going on around him. The uncle of\r\nAtticus, the brother of his mother, whose family tomb we are now\r\nexamining, left him at his death an enormous fortune, which he had\r\namassed by usury. Atticus added greatly to it by acting as a kind of\r\npublisher to the authors of the day--that is, by employing his\r\nnumerous slaves in copying and multiplying their manuscripts. He kept\r\nhimself free from all the political factions of the times, and thus\r\nmanaged to preserve the mutual regard of parties who were hostile to\r\neach other,--such as Cæsar and Pompey, Brutus and Antony. He reached\r\nthe age of seventy-seven years without having had a day's illness;\r\nand when at last stricken with an incurable disease, in the spirit of\r\nthe Epicurean philosophy, since he could enjoy life no longer he\r\nstarved himself to death, and was interred in his uncle's tomb on the\r\nAppian Way. Almost side by side with this ruin is the sepulchre of the\r\nfamily of Cicero's wife, the Terentii, who were related to Pomponius\r\nAtticus by the mother's side. In all likelihood Terentia herself,\r\nCicero's brave and devoted but ill-used wife, was interred here with\r\nher own friends, for her husband had divorced her in order to marry a\r\nbeautiful and rich young heiress, whose guardian he had been.\r\n\r\nPassing on the same side of the road two or three tombs of obscure\r\npersons whose names alone are known, we come at the sixth milestone to\r\none of the most extraordinary sepulchral monuments of the Appian Way,\r\ncalled the _Casale Rotondo_. This monument marks the limit to which\r\nmost visitors extend their explorations. It is circular, like the tomb\r\nof Cæcilia Metella; but it is of far larger dimensions, being nearly\r\nthree hundred and fifty feet in diameter. In the fifteenth century\r\nthis colossal ruin was converted into a fortress by the Orsini family;\r\nand of the remains of this fortification a farmhouse and other\r\nbuildings were constructed, and these now stand on the summit,\r\nsurrounded by a tolerably-sized oliveyard and garden, with a sloping\r\ngrass-grown stair leading up to them on the outside. Notwithstanding\r\ntheir dislike of death and their horror of dead bodies, the modern\r\nRomans have no more repugnance to the proximity of tombs than their\r\nancestors had. Shepherds fold their sheep and goats in the interior of\r\nthe old tombs, whose walls are blackened with the smoke of the fires,\r\nand retain an odour of human and animal occupancy more disagreeable\r\nthan any which the original tenants could have exhaled; and it is by\r\nno means unfrequent to find a wine-shop, with a noisy company of\r\nwayfarers regaling themselves, in a sepulchre that happens to be\r\nconveniently situated by the wayside. So far as can be ascertained,\r\nthe original appearance of the _Casale Rotondo_ seems to have been\r\nthat of an enormous circular tower, cased with large blocks of\r\ntravertine, covered with a pyramidal roof of the same material carved\r\ninto the semblance of tiles, and surmounted with appropriate\r\nsculpture. It was surrounded with a wall of peperino, supporting at\r\nintervals vases and statues; and on the outside were semicircular\r\nstone seats for the benefit of weary wayfarers. This wall is now grown\r\nover with turf, but it can be distinctly traced all round; and the\r\nhollow space between it and the tomb is covered with thick grass, and\r\nis sometimes filled with water like a fosse. Numerous altars,\r\npedestals, and fine specimens of sculpture in marble and peperino,\r\nhave been disinterred in this spot, and they are now arranged to\r\nadvantage at the foot of the huge pile fronting the road. Some of\r\nthese bear inscriptions which would indicate that the tomb was erected\r\nto Messalla Corvinus, the friend of Horace and Augustus, and himself a\r\ndistinguished historian and poet as well as one of the most\r\ninfluential senators of Rome, by his son Marcus Aurelius Corvinus\r\nCotta, who was consul some years after his father's death. Corvinus\r\ndied in the eleventh year of our era, so that the tomb has stood for\r\nupwards of eighteen centuries and a half; and it is as likely to stand\r\nas many more, for what remains of it is as firm and enduring as a\r\nrock. In the farmhouse built on its massive platform several\r\ngenerations have lived and died. They have eaten and drunk, they have\r\nmarried and been given in marriage, they have cultivated their vines\r\nand olives and consumed their products. And all the time their home\r\nand their field of labour have been on a tomb! I did not see the\r\ntenants of this curious dwelling during my visit; but if the skeleton\r\nat the Egyptian feast was a useful reminder of human mortality to the\r\nrevellers, one would suppose that the thought of the peculiar\r\ncharacter of their home would be sufficient to impart a soberer hue\r\nto their lives. What is our earth itself but, on a vaster scale, a\r\n_Casale Rotondo_--a garden in a sepulchre--where the dust we tread on\r\nwas once alive; and we reap our daily bread from human mould--\r\n\r\n    \"Earth builds on the earth castles and towers,\r\n    Earth says to the earth--All shall be ours.\"\r\n\r\nAt a distance of about seven minutes' walk is an enormous circular\r\ntomb, with a medieval tower of lava stones erected upon it, called the\r\n_Torre di Selce_; but there is nothing to indicate who was interred in\r\nit, though it must have been a person of some celebrity at the time.\r\nAn inscription upon a tomb beside it naively tells the passer-by to\r\nrespect the last resting-place of one who had a shop on the _Via\r\nSacra_, where he sold jewellery and millinery, and was held in much\r\nestimation by his customers. Beyond this point there is nothing of any\r\nspecial interest to arrest our attention, till we come to a\r\nconsiderable mass of ruins, consisting of broken Doric columns of\r\npeperino, part of a rough mosaic floor and brick pavement, and\r\nfragments of walls lined with tufa squares in the _opus reticulatum_\r\npattern. These remains are supposed to mark the spot on which stood\r\nthe Temple of Hercules, erected by Domitian, and alluded to in one of\r\nthe epigrams of the poet Martial. Near this spot are the tomb of the\r\nconsul Quintus Veranius, who died in Britain in the year 55 of our\r\nera; a lofty circular tomb, to some one unknown, with a rude\r\nshepherd's hut on the top of it, to which the peasants have given the\r\nname of Torraccio; and the tomb of a marble contractor. It may be\r\nremarked, in connection with this last mentioned tomb, that a Roman\r\nstatuary had his workshops for the manufacture of sepulchral monuments\r\nand sarcophagi on the Appian Way, which were of great extent, judging\r\nfrom the quantity of sculpture, finished and unfinished, found on the\r\nspot. All the sculpture was manifestly copied from Greek originals,\r\nfor it is hardly conceivable that such groupings and expressions as\r\nwe see in these bad copies could have been first executed by such\r\ninferior artists. In this neighbourhood were the villa and farm of the\r\npoet Persius, and portions of the wall are still standing. At the\r\nninth milestone are the tomb and the remains of the villa of the\r\nEmperor Gallienus, slain by a conspiracy among his officers at the\r\nsiege of Milan in the year 268. This emperor has left nothing behind\r\nbut the memory of his luxury and his vices. When the site of the villa\r\nwas excavated by an English artist, Gavin Hamilton, at the end of last\r\ncentury, the famous statue of the Discobolus and several other\r\nspecimens of ancient sculpture were discovered, which are now in the\r\nVatican Gallery. The ground hereabouts produces a whitish\r\nefflorescence, and emits a most offensive sulphurous smell. It\r\nexhibits the same evidences of recent volcanic activity as the\r\nneighbourhood of Lakes Tartarus and Solfatara on the way to Tivoli.\r\n\r\nThe road after this descends into a valley, through which the stream\r\nof the Ponticello flows, passing a most massive circular tomb,\r\nreminding one of the mounds of the Horatii and Curiatii; and as it\r\nascends gradually on the opposite side, two huge sepulchres of the\r\nImperial period--one on the right hand and the other on the\r\nleft--attract notice, and are the last on this part of the route. The\r\nrailway to Naples passes across the road at the eleventh milestone,\r\nand disturbs the solemn silence three or four times a day by its\r\nincongruous noise. Beyond this is the osteria and village of\r\nFrattocchie, where the old Appian Way merges into the new, and ascends\r\ncontinuously to Albano. This neighbourhood is full of historical\r\nassociations. It was at Frattocchie that the body of Clodius was left\r\nlying on the road after his fatal encounter with Milo. This fray\r\nfurnished the occasion for one of Cicero's most eloquent\r\nspeeches,--that in defence of Milo,--which was written, but owing to\r\nthe disturbances in the Forum at the time was not delivered. On the\r\nleft of the village, near a railway bridge and several quarries of\r\nvery old hard lava, is the site of Appiolæ, one of the cities of the\r\nLatin League, destroyed by Tarquinius Priscus. All the male population\r\nwere killed, and the women and children transferred to Rome; and with\r\nthe spoils the Capitolium was completed. The remains of the old city\r\nare very slight, consisting of a wall, a few vestiges of a temple, and\r\nsome foundations on a cliff surrounded by a stream, which could be\r\ndammed up and flooded so as to form a fosse. On the right of\r\nFrattocchie are the ruins of _Bovillæ_, taken and plundered by\r\nCoriolanus, and deserted in the time of Cicero. Some arches of the\r\ncorridor of an amphitheatre, a reservoir for water, tolerably perfect,\r\nand a circus, are still visible. There are also the ruins of a forum.\r\nThe view, looking back from this elevated position upon the long\r\ncourse of the Appian Way, is exceedingly striking. One feels, when\r\ngazing on the long perspective of rugged and mouldering sepulchres,\r\nthe full force of the name _Strada del Diavolo_ which the peasants\r\ngive to this street of tombs; and can sympathise with the sentiment\r\nthat made Charles Dickens say, when standing here at sunset, after\r\nhaving walked all the way from Rome, \"I almost felt as if the sun\r\nwould never rise again, but look its last that night upon a ruined\r\nworld.\"\r\n\r\nWe can picture St. Paul's memorable journey from Puteoli to Rome by\r\nthis route. The thought that the eye of the great apostle must have\r\nrested upon the same features of the landscape, and many of the same\r\nobjects, though now in ruins, that we still behold, invests them with\r\nan indescribable charm. From beyond the gates of Albano, near which\r\nstood the lofty tomb of Pompey, whose ashes had only recently been\r\nbrought from the scene of his murder in Egypt, by his devoted wife\r\nCornelia, he would obtain his first glimpse of Rome. And if now it is\r\nthe most thrilling moment in a man's life to see Rome in its ruin,\r\nwhat must it have been to see it then in its glory! We can imagine\r\nthat, with the profound emotion of his Master when gazing upon the\r\nsplendour of Jerusalem from the slope of Olivet, St. Paul would look\r\ndown from that spot on the capital of the world, and see before him\r\nthe signs of a magnificence never before or since equalled; but alas!\r\nas he knew well, a magnificence that was only the iridescence of\r\nsocial and spiritual corruption, as the pomp of the sepulchres of the\r\nAppian Way was but the shroud of death. Doubtless with a sad and\r\npitying heart, he would be led by the cohort of soldiers along the\r\nstreet of tombs, then the most crowded approach to a city of nearly\r\ntwo millions of souls; tombs whose massiveness and solidity were but a\r\nvain craving for immortality, and whose epitaphs were the most deeply\r\ntouching of all epitaphs, on account of the profound despair with\r\nwhich they bade their eternal farewell. Entering into Rome through the\r\nPorta Capena; and winding through the valley between the Coelian and\r\nAventine hills, crowded with temples and palaces, he would be brought\r\nto the Forum, then a scene of indescribable grandeur; and from thence\r\nhe would be finally transferred to the charge of Burrus, the prefect\r\nof the imperial guards, at the prætorium of Nero's palace, on the\r\nPalatine. And here he disappears from our view. We only know of a\r\ncertainty that for two whole years \"he dwelt in his own hired house,\r\nand received all that came in unto him, preaching the kingdom of God,\r\nand teaching those things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ, with all\r\nconfidence, no man forbidding him.\"\r\n\r\nOf all the splendid associations of the Appian Way, along which\r\nhistory may be said to have marched exclusively for nigh six hundred\r\nyears, the most splendid by far is its connection with this\r\never-memorable journey of the great Apostle of the Gentiles. We can\r\ntrace the influence of the scenes and objects along the route in all\r\nhis subsequent writings. He had a deeper yearning for the Gentiles,\r\nbecause he thus beheld with his own eyes the places associated with\r\nthe darkest aspects of paganism; the scenes that gave rise to the\r\npagan ideas of heaven and hell; the splendid temples in which the\r\nhuman soul had debased itself to objects beneath the dignity of its\r\nown nature, and thus prepared itself for all moral corruption; and the\r\nmassive sepulchral monuments in which the hopeless despair of\r\nheathenism had, as it were, become petrified by the Gorgon gaze of\r\ndeath. That Appian Way should be to us the most interesting of all the\r\nroads of the world; for by it came to us our civilisation and\r\nChristianity--the divine principles and hopes that redeem the soul,\r\nretrieve the vanity of existence, open up the path of life through the\r\ndark valley of death, and disclose the glorious vista of immortality\r\nbeyond the tomb. And as we gaze upon the remains of that road, and\r\nfeel how much we owe to it as the material channel of God's grace to\r\nus who were far off, we can say with deepest gratitude of those\r\napostles and martyrs who once walked on this lava pavement, but are\r\nnow standing on the sea of glass before the throne, \"How beautiful are\r\nthe feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad\r\ntidings of good things!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE CUMÆAN SIBYL\r\n\r\n\r\nA part of the monotonous coast-line of Palestine extends into the\r\nMediterranean considerably beyond the rest at Carmel. In this bluff\r\npromontory the Holy Land reaches out, as it were, towards the Western\r\nWorld; and like a tie-stone that projects from the gable of the first\r\nof a row of houses, indicating that other buildings are to be added,\r\nit shows that the inheritance of Israel was not meant to be always\r\nexclusive, but was destined to comprehend all the countries which its\r\nfaith should annex. The remarkable geographical position of this long\r\nprojecting ridge by the sea--itself a symbol and prophecy--and its\r\npeculiar physical features, differing from those of the rest of\r\nPalestine, and approximating to a European type of scenery, early\r\nmarked it out as a religious spot. It was held sacred from time\r\nimmemorial; an altar existed there long before Elijah's discomfiture\r\nof the priests of Baal; the people were accustomed to resort to the\r\nsanctuary of its \"high place\" during new moons and Sabbaths; and to\r\nits haunted strand came pilgrims from distant regions, to which the\r\nfame of its sanctity had spread. One of the great schools of the\r\nprophets of Israel, superintended by Elisha, was planted on one of its\r\nmountain prominences. The solitary Elijah found a refuge in its bosom,\r\nand came and went from it to the haunts of men like one of its own\r\nsudden storms; and in its rocky dells and dense thickets of oaks and\r\nevergreens were uttered prophecies of a larger history and a grander\r\nsalvation, which transcended the narrow circle of Jewish ideas as much\r\nas the excellency of Carmel transcended the other landscapes of\r\nPalestine.\r\n\r\nTo this instance of striking correspondence between the peculiar\r\nnature of a spot and its peculiar religious history in Asia, a\r\nparallel may be found in Europe. A part of the long uniform western\r\ncoast-line of Italy stretches out into the Mediterranean at Cumæ, near\r\nthe city of Naples. Early colonists from Greece, in search of a new\r\nhome, found in its bays, islands, and promontories a touching\r\nresemblance to the intricate coast scenery of their own country. On a\r\nsolitary rock overlooking the sea they built their citadel and\r\nestablished their worship. In this rock was the traditional cave of\r\nthe Cumæan Sibyl, where she gave utterance to the inspirations of\r\npagan prophecy a thousand years before St. John received the visions\r\nof the Apocalypse on the lone heights of the Ægean isle. The\r\npromontory of Cumæ, like that of Carmel, typified the onward course of\r\nhistory and religion--a great advance in men's ideas upon those of the\r\npast. The western sea-board is the historic side of Italy. All its\r\ngreat cities and renowned sites are on the western side of the\r\nApennines; the other side, looking eastward, with the exception of\r\nVenice and Ravenna, containing hardly any place that stands out\r\nprominently in the history of the world. And at Cumæ this western\r\ntendency of Italy was most pronounced. On this westmost promontory of\r\nthe beautiful land--the farthest point reached by the oldest\r\ncivilisation of Egypt and Greece--the Sibyl stood on her watch-tower,\r\nand gazed with prophetic eye upon the distant horizon, seeing beyond\r\nthe light of the setting sun and \"the baths of all the western stars\"\r\nthe dawn of a more wonderful future, and dreamt of a--\r\n\r\n    \"Vast brotherhood of hearts and hands,\r\n    Choir of a world in perfect tune.\"\r\n\r\nCumæ is only five miles distant from Puteoli, and about thirteen west\r\nof Naples. But it lies so much out of the way that it is difficult to\r\ncombine it with the other famous localities in this classic\r\nneighbourhood in one day's excursion, and hence it is very often\r\nomitted. It amply, however, repays a special visit, not so much by\r\nwhat it reveals as by what it suggests. There are two ways by which it\r\ncan be approached, either by the _Via Cumana_, which gradually ascends\r\nfrom Puteoli along the ridge of the low volcanic hills on the western\r\nside of Lake Avernus, and passes under the Arco Felice, a huge brick\r\narch, evidently a fragment of an ancient Roman aqueduct, spanning a\r\nravine at a great height; or directly from the western shore of Lake\r\nAvernus, by an ancient road paved with blocks of lava, and leading\r\nthrough an enormous tunnel, called the _Grotta de Pietro Pace_, about\r\nthree-quarters of a mile long, lighted at intervals by shafts from\r\nabove, said to have been excavated by Agrippa. Both ways are deeply\r\ninteresting; but the latter is perhaps preferable because of the\r\nsaving of time and trouble which it effects.\r\n\r\nThe first glimpse of Cumæ, though very impressive to the imagination,\r\nis not equally so to the eye. Crossing some cultivated fields, a bold\r\neminence of trachytic tufa, covered with scanty grass and tufts of\r\nbrushwood, rises between you and the sea, forming part of a range of\r\nlow hills, which evidently mark the ancient coast-line. On this\r\nelevated plateau, commanding a most splendid view of the blue, sunlit\r\nMediterranean as far as Gaeta and the Ponza Islands, stood the almost\r\nmythical city; and crowning its highest point, where a rocky\r\nescarpment, broken down on every side except on the south, by which it\r\ncan be ascended, the massive foundations of the walls of the Acropolis\r\nmay still be traced throughout their whole extent. Very few relics of\r\nthe original Greek colony survive; and these have to be sought chiefly\r\nunderneath the remains of Roman-Gothic and medieval dynasties, which\r\nsuccessively occupied the place, and partially obliterated each other,\r\nlike the different layers of writing in a palimpsest. Time and the\r\npassions of man have dealt more ruthlessly with this than with almost\r\nany other of the renowned spots of Italy. Some fragments of the\r\nancient fortifications, a confused and scattered heap of ruins within\r\nthe line of the city walls, and a portion of a fluted column, and a\r\nsingle Doric capital of the grand old style, supposed to belong to the\r\ntemple of Apollo, on the summit of the Acropolis, are all that meet\r\nthe eye to remind us of this home of ancient faith and prophecy. In\r\nthe plain at the foot of the rock is the Necropolis of Cumæ, the most\r\nancient burial-place in Italy, from whose rifled Greek graves a most\r\nvaluable collection of archaic vases and personal ornaments were\r\nobtained and transferred to the museums of Naples, Paris, and St.\r\nPetersburg; but the tombs themselves have now been destroyed, and only\r\na few marble fragments of Roman sepulchral decoration scattered around\r\nindicate the spot. And not far off, partially concealed by earth and\r\nunderwood, may be seen the ruins of the amphitheatre, with its\r\ntwenty-one tiers of seats leading down to the arena.\r\n\r\nYou look in vain for any trace of the sanctuary of the most celebrated\r\nof the Sibyls. Her tomb is pointed out as a vague ruin a short\r\ndistance from the Necropolis, among the tombs which line the Via\r\nDomitiana; and Justin Martyr and Pausanias both describe a round\r\ncinerary urn found in this spot which was said to have contained her\r\nashes. The tufa rock of the Acropolis is pierced with numerous dark\r\ncaverns and labyrinthine passages, the work of prehistoric\r\ninhabitants, which have only been partially explored on account of the\r\ndifficulty and danger, and any one of which might have been the abode\r\nof the prophetess. A larger excavation in the side of the hill facing\r\nthe sea, with a flight of steps leading up from it into another\r\nsmaller recess, and numerous lateral openings and subterranean\r\npassages, supposed to penetrate into the very heart of the mountain,\r\nand even to communicate with Lake Fusaro, is pointed out by the local\r\nguides as the Sibyl's Cave, which, as Virgil tells us, had a hundred\r\nentrances and issues, from whence as many resounding voices echoed\r\nforth the oracles of the inspired priestess. But we are confused in\r\nour efforts at identification; for another cavern bore this name in\r\nformer ages, which was destroyed by the explosion of the combustible\r\nmaterials with which Narses filled it in undermining the citadel.\r\nThis, we have reason to believe, was the cave which Justin Martyr\r\nvisited more than seventeen hundred years ago, and of which he has\r\nleft behind a most interesting account. \"We saw,\" he says, \"when we\r\nwere in Cumæ, a place where a sanctuary is hollowed in the rock--a\r\nthing really wonderful and worthy of all admiration. Here the Sibyl\r\ndelivered her oracles, we were told by those who had received them\r\nfrom their ancestors, and who kept them even as their patrimony. Also,\r\nin the middle of the sanctuary, they showed us three receptacles cut\r\nin the same rock, and in which, they being filled with water, she\r\nbathed, as they said, and when she resumed her garments, she retired\r\ninto the inner part of the sanctuary, likewise cut in the same rock,\r\nand there being seated on a high place in the centre, she prophesied.\"\r\nBut after all you do not care to fasten your attention upon any\r\nparticular spot, for you feel that the whole place is overshadowed by\r\nthe presence of this mysterious being; and rock, and hill, and bush\r\nare invested with an air of solemn majesty, and with the memory of an\r\nancient sanctity.\r\n\r\nNature has taken back the ruins of Cumæ so completely to her own\r\nbosom, that it is difficult to believe that on this desolate spot once\r\nstood one of the most powerful cities of antiquity, which colonised a\r\nlarge part of Southern Italy. A sad, lonely, fateful place it is,\r\nhaunted for ever by the gods of old, the dreams of men. A silence,\r\nalmost painful in its intensity, broods over its deserted fields;\r\nhardly a living thing disturbs the solitude; and the traces of man's\r\noccupancy are few and faint. The air seems heavy with the breath of\r\nthe malaria; and no one would care to run the risk of fever by\r\nlingering on the spot to watch the sunset gilding the gloom of the\r\nAcropolis with a halo of kindred radiance. Every breeze that stirs the\r\ntall grasses and the leaves of the brushwood of the dismantled citadel\r\nhas a wail in it; the long-drawn murmur of the peaceful sea at the\r\nfoot of the hill comes up with a melancholy cadence to the ear; and\r\neven on the beautiful cyclamens and veronicas that strive to enliven\r\nthe ruins of the temples of Apollo and Serapis, emblems of the\r\nimmortal youth and signs of the renewing power of Nature as they are,\r\nhas fallen the gray shadow of the past. Each pathetic bit of ruin has\r\nabout it the consciousness of an almost fabulous antiquity, and by its\r\nvery vagueness appeals more powerfully to the imagination than any\r\nhistorical associations. \"Time here seems to have folded its wings.\"\r\nIn the immemorial calm that is in the air a thousand years seem as one\r\nday. Through all the dim ages no feature of its rugged face has\r\nchanged; and all the potent spell of summer noons can only win from it\r\na languid smile of faintest verdure. The sight of the scanty walls and\r\nscattered bits of Greek sculpture here take you back to the speechless\r\nages that have left no other memorials of their activity. What is fact\r\nand what is fable it were difficult to tell in this far-away\r\nborderland where they seem to blend. And I do not envy the man who is\r\nnot deeply moved at the thought of the simple, old-world piety that\r\nplaced a holy presence in this solitary spot, and of the tender awe\r\nwith which the mysterious divinity of Cumæ was worshipped by\r\ngenerations of like passions and sorrows with ourselves--whose very\r\ngraves under the shadow of this romantic hill had vanished long ages\r\nbefore our history had begun.\r\n\r\nEvery schoolboy is familiar with the picturesque Roman legend of the\r\nSibyl. It is variously told in connection with the elder and the later\r\nTarquin, the two Etruscan kings of Rome; and the scene of it is laid\r\nby some in Cumæ--where Tarquinius Superbus spent the last years of\r\nhis life in exile--and by others in Rome. But the majority of writers\r\nassociate it with the building of the great temple of Jupiter on the\r\nCapitoline Hill. Several prodigies, significant of the future fate of\r\nRome and of the reigning dynasty, occurred when the foundations of\r\nthis temple were dug and the walls of it built. A fresh human head,\r\ndripping gore, was found deep down beneath the earth, which implied\r\nthat this spot was destined to become the head of the whole world; and\r\nhence the old name of the \"Saturnine Hill\" was changed to the\r\n\"Capitoline.\" All the gods who had been worshipped from time\r\nimmemorial on this hill, when consulted by auguries, gave permission\r\nfor the removal of their shrines and altars in order that room might\r\nbe provided for the gigantic temple of the great Ruler of the gods,\r\nsave Terminus and Youth, who refused to abandon the sacred spot, and\r\nwhose obstinacy was therefore regarded as a sign that the boundaries\r\nof the city should never be removed, and that her youth would be\r\nperpetually renewed. But a still more wonderful sign of the future of\r\nRome was given on this occasion. A mysterious woman, endowed with\r\npreternatural longevity--believed to be no other than Deiphobe, the\r\nCumæan Sibyl herself, the daughter of Circe and Gnostus, who had been\r\nthe guide of Æneas into the world of the dead--appeared before Tarquin\r\nand offered him for a certain price nine books, which contained her\r\nprophecies in mystic rhyme. Tarquin, ignorant of the value of the\r\nbooks, refused to buy them. The Sibyl departed, and burned three of\r\nthem. Coming back immediately, she offered the remaining six at the\r\nsame price that she had asked for the nine. Tarquin again refused;\r\nwhereupon the Sibyl burned three more volumes, and returning the third\r\ntime, made the same demand for the reduced remnant. Struck with the\r\nsingularity of the proceeding, the king consulted the augurs; and\r\nlearning from them the inestimable preciousness of the books, he\r\nbought them, and the Sibyl forthwith vanished as mysteriously as she\r\nhad appeared. This legend reads like a moral apothegm on the\r\nincreasing value of life as it passes away.\r\n\r\nWhatever credence we may attach to this account of their origin--or\r\nrather, whatever sediment of historical truth may have been\r\nprecipitated in the fable--there can be no doubt that the so-called\r\nSibylline books of Rome did actually exist, and that for a very long\r\nperiod they were held in the highest veneration. They were concealed\r\nin a stone chest, buried under the ground, in the temple of Jupiter,\r\non the Capitol. Two officers of the highest rank were appointed to\r\nguard them, whose punishment, if found unfaithful to their trust, was\r\nto be sewed up alive in a sack and thrown into the sea. The number of\r\nguardians was afterwards increased, at first to ten and then to\r\nfifteen, whose priesthood was for life, and who in consequence were\r\nexempted from the obligation of serving in the army and from other\r\npublic offices in the city. Being regarded as the priests of Apollo,\r\nthey had each in front of his house a brazen tripod, similar to that\r\non which the priestess of Delphi sat.\r\n\r\nThe contents of the Sibylline books, being supposed to contain the\r\nfate of the Roman Empire, were kept a profound secret, and only on\r\noccasions of public danger or calamity, and by special order of the\r\nsenate, were they allowed to be consulted. When the Capitol was burned\r\nin the Marsic war, eighty-two years before Christ, they perished in\r\nthe flames: but so seriously was the loss regarded that ambassadors\r\nwere sent to Greece, Asia Minor, and Cumæ, wherever Sibylline\r\ninspiration was supposed to exist, to collect the prophetic oracles,\r\nand thus make up as far as possible for what had been lost. In Cumæ\r\nnothing was discovered; but at Erythræa and Samos a large number of\r\nmystic verses, said to have been composed by the Sibyl, were found.\r\nSome of them were collected into a volume, after having been purged\r\nfrom all spurious or suspected elements; and the volume was brought to\r\nRome, and deposited in two gilt cases at the base of the statue of\r\nApollo, in the temple of that god on the Palatine.\r\n\r\nMore than two thousand prophetic books, pretending to be Sibylline\r\noracles, were found by Augustus in the possession of private persons;\r\nand these were condemned to be burned, and in future no private person\r\nwas allowed to keep any writings of the kind. But in spite of every\r\nattempt to authenticate the books that were publicly accepted, the new\r\ncollection was never regarded with the same veneration as the original\r\nvolumes of Tarquin which it replaced. A certain suspicion of\r\nspuriousness continued to cling to it, and greatly diminished its\r\nauthority. It was seldom consulted. The Roman emperors after\r\nTiberius--who still further sifted it--utterly neglected the\r\nreceived collection; and not till shortly before the fatal battle of\r\nthe Milvian Bridge, which overthrew paganism, was it again brought\r\nout, by Maxentius, for the purpose of indicating the fate of the\r\nenterprise. Julian the Apostate, in his attempt to galvanise the dead\r\npagan religion into the semblance of life, sought to revive an\r\ninterest in the Sibylline oracles, which were so closely identified\r\nwith the political and religious fortunes of Rome. But his effort was\r\nvain: they fell into greater oblivion than before; and at last they\r\nwere publicly burned by Stilicho, the father-in-law of the Emperor\r\nHonorius--called the Defender of Italy--whose own execution as a\r\ntraitor at Ravenna shortly afterwards was considered by the pagan\r\nzealots as the just vengeance of the gods on his dreadful sacrilege.\r\n\r\nUnlike the Jewish and Indian faiths, the Greek and Roman religions had\r\nno authoritative writings, and were not embodied in a system of\r\nelaborate dogmas. The Sibylline oracles may therefore be said to have\r\nformed their sacred scriptures, and to have served the purpose of a\r\ncommon religious creed in securing national unity. The original books\r\nof the Cumæan Sibyl were written in Greek, which was the language of\r\nthe whole of the south of Italy at that time. The oracles were\r\ninscribed upon palm leaves; to which circumstance Virgil alludes in\r\nhis description of the sayings of the Cumæan Sibyl being written upon\r\nthe leaves of the forest. They were in the form of acrostic verses;\r\nthe letters of the first verse of each oracle containing in regular\r\nsequence the initial letters of all the subsequent verses. They were\r\nfull of enigmas and mysterious analogies, founded upon the numerical\r\nvalue of the initial letters of certain names. It is supposed that\r\nthey contained not so much predictions of future events, as directions\r\nregarding the means by which the wrath of the gods, as revealed by\r\nprodigies and calamities, might be appeased. They seemed to have been\r\nconsulted in the same way as Eastern nations consult the Koran and\r\nHafiz. There was no attempt made to find a passage suitable to the\r\noccasion, but one of the palm leaves after being shuffled was selected\r\nat random. To this custom of drawing fateful leaves from the Sibylline\r\nbooks--called in consequence _sortes sibyllinæ_--there is frequent\r\nallusion by classic authors. We know that the writings of Homer and\r\nVirgil were thus treated. The elevation of Septimius Severus to the\r\nthrone of the Roman Empire was supposed to have been foretold by the\r\ncircumstance that he opened by chance the writings of Lampridius at\r\nthe verse, \"Remember, Roman, with imperial sway to rule the people.\"\r\nThe Bible itself was used by the early Christians for such purposes of\r\ndivination. St. Augustine, though he condemned the practice as an\r\nabuse of the Divine Word, yet preferred that men should have recourse\r\nto the Gospels rather than to heathen works. Heraclius is reported by\r\nCedrenus to have asked counsel of the New Testament, and to have been\r\nthereby persuaded to winter in Albania. Nicephorus Gregoras frequently\r\nopened his Psalter at random in order that there he might find support\r\nin the trial under which he laboured. And even in these enlightened\r\ndays, it is by no means rare to find superstitious men and women using\r\nthe sacred Scriptures as the old Greeks and Romans used the Sibylline\r\noracles--dipping into them by chance for indications of the Divine\r\nWill.\r\n\r\nThe Cumæan Sibyl was not the only prophetess of the kind. There were\r\nno less than ten females, endowed with the gift of prevision, and held\r\nin high repute, to whom the name of Sibyl was given. We read of the\r\nPersian Sibyl, the Libyan, the Delphic, the Erythræan, the\r\nHellespontine, the Phrygian, and the Tiburtine. With the name of the\r\nlast-mentioned Sibyl tourists make acquaintance at Tivoli. Two ancient\r\ntemples in tolerable preservation are still standing on the very edge\r\nof the deep rocky ravine through which the Anio pours its foaming\r\nflood. The one is a small circular building, with ten pillars\r\nsurrounding the broken-down cella, whose familiar appearance is often\r\nrepresented in plaster models and bronze and marble ornamental\r\narticles, taken home as souvenirs by travellers; and the other stands\r\nclose by, and has been transformed into the present church of St.\r\nGiorgio. This latter temple is supposed, from a bas-relief found in\r\nit, representing the Sibyl sitting in the act of delivering an oracle,\r\nto be the ancient shrine of the Sibyl Albunea mentioned by Horace,\r\nTibullus, and Lactantius. The earliest bronze statues at Rome were\r\nthose of the three Sibyls, placed near the Rostra, in the middle of\r\nthe Forum. No specimens of the literature of Rome precede the\r\nSibylline books, except the rude hymn known as the Litany of the Arval\r\nBrothers, dating from the time of Romulus himself, which is simply an\r\naddress to Mars, the Lares, and the Semones, praying for fair weather\r\nand for protection to the flocks. And it is thus most interesting to\r\nnotice that the two compositions which lay at the foundation of all\r\nthe splendid Latin literature of later ages were of an eminently\r\nreligious character.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable things connected with the pagan Sibyls were\r\nthe apocryphal Jewish and Christian prophecies to which they gave\r\nrise. When the sacred oak of Dodona perished down to the ground, out\r\nof its roots sprang up a fresh growth of fictitious prophetic\r\nliterature. This literature emanated from different nationalities and\r\ndifferent schools of thought. It combined classical story and\r\nScripture tradition. Most of it was the product of pre-Christian\r\nJudaism, and seemed to have been composed in times of great national\r\nexcitement. The misery of the present, the prospect still more gloomy\r\nbeyond, impelled its authors to anxious inquiries into the future. The\r\nbooks were written, like the genuine Sibylline books, in the metrical\r\nform, which the old Greek tradition had consecrated to religious use;\r\nand their style so closely resembled that of the Apocalypse and the\r\nOld Testament prophecies, that some pagan writers who accepted them as\r\ngenuine did not hesitate to say that the writers of the Bible had\r\nplagiarised parts of their prophecies from the oracles of the Sibyls.\r\n\r\nFew fragments of the genuine Sibylline books remain to us, and these\r\nare to be found chiefly in the writings of Ovid and Virgil, whose\r\n\"Golden Age\" and well-known \"Fourth Eclogue\" were greatly indebted for\r\ntheir materials to them. But we possess a large collection of the\r\nJudæo-Christian oracles, which were probably gathered together by some\r\nunknown editor in the seventh century. Originally there were fourteen\r\nbooks of unequal antiquity and value, but some of them have been lost.\r\nCardinal Angelo Mai discovered in the Ambrosian Library at Milan a\r\nmanuscript which contained the eleventh book entire, besides a portion\r\nof the sixth and eighth books; and a few years later, among the secret\r\nstores of the Vatican Library, he found two other manuscripts which\r\ncontained entire the last four books of the collection. These were\r\npublished in Rome in 1828. The best edition of all the extant books is\r\nthat which M. Alexandre issued in Paris, under the name of _Oracula\r\nSibyllina_. This editor exaggerates the extent of the Christian\r\nelement in the Sibylline prophecies; but his dissertation on the\r\norigin and value of the several portions of the books is exceedingly\r\ninteresting. The oldest book is undoubtedly the third, part of which\r\nis preserved in the writings of Theophilus of Antioch, and originally\r\nconsisted of one thousand verses, most of which we possess. It was\r\nprobably composed at the beginning of the Maccabean period, about 146\r\nB.C., when Ptolemy VII. (Physcon) had become king of Egypt, and the\r\nbitter enemy of the Jews in Alexandria, and when the Jewish nation in\r\nPalestine had been rejoicing in their independence, through the\r\noverthrow of the empire of the Seleucidæ by the usurper Tryphon. The\r\nfourth book was written soon after the eruption of Vesuvius in the\r\nyear of our era 79, and is a most interesting record of Jewish\r\nEssenism. It contains the first anticipation of the return of Nero,\r\nbut in a Jewish form, without Nero's death and resuscitation. The last\r\nof the Sibylline books seems to have been written about the beginning\r\nof the seventh century, and was directed against the new creed of\r\nIslam, which had suddenly sprung up, and in its fierce fanaticism was\r\ncarrying everything before it. In this apocalyptic literature--the\r\nlast growth of Judaism--the voice of paganism itself was employed to\r\nwitness for the supremacy of the Jewish religion. It embraces all\r\nhistory in one great theocratic view, and completes the picture of the\r\nJewish triumph by the prophecy of a great Deliverer, who shall\r\nestablish the Jewish law as the rule of the whole earth, and shall\r\ndestroy with a fiery flood all that is corrupt and perishable. In\r\nthese respects the Jewish Sibylline oracles have an interesting\r\nconnection with other apocryphal Jewish writings, such as the Fourth\r\nBook of Esdras, the Apocalypse of Henoch, and the Book of Jubilees;\r\nand they may all be regarded as attempts to carry down the spirit of\r\nprophecy beyond the canonical Scriptures, and to furnish a supplement\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nSo highly prized was this group of apocryphal Jewish oracles by the\r\nprimitive Christians, that several new ones were added to them by\r\nChristian hands which have not come down to us in their original\r\nstate. They were regarded as genuine productions, possessing an\r\nindependent authority which, if not divine, was certainly\r\nsupernatural; and some did not hesitate even to place them by the side\r\nof the Old Testament prophecies. In the very earliest controversies\r\nbetween Christians and the advocates of paganism, they were appealed\r\nto frequently as authorities which both recognised. Christian\r\napologists of the second century, such as Tatian, Athenagoras, and\r\nvery specially Justin Martyr, implicitly relied upon them as\r\nindisputable. Even the oracles of the pagan Sibyl were regarded by\r\nChristian writers with an awe and reverence little short of that which\r\nthey inspired in the minds of the heathen themselves. Clement of\r\nAlexandria does not scruple to call the Cumæan Sibyl a true\r\nprophetess, and her oracles saving canticles. And St. Augustine\r\nincludes her among the number of those who belong to the \"City of\r\nGod.\" And this idea of the Sibyl's sacredness continued to a late age\r\nin the Christian Church. She had a place in the prophetic order beside\r\nthe patriarchs and prophets of old, and joined in the great procession\r\nof the witnesses for the faith from Seth and Enoch down to the last\r\nChristian saint and martyr. In one of the grandest hymns of the Roman\r\nCatholic Church, composed by Tommaso di Celano at the beginning of the\r\nfourteenth century, there is an allusion to her, taken from the\r\nwell-known acrostic in the last judgment scene in the eighth book of\r\nthe _Oracula Sibyllina_--\r\n\r\n    \"Dies iræ, dies illa,\r\n    Solvet sæclum in favilla,\r\n    Teste David cum _Sibylla_.\"\r\n\r\nThe strange Italian mystic of the fifteenth century, Pico della\r\nMirandola, who sought to reconcile the Christian sentiment with the\r\nimagery and legends of pagan religion, rehabilitated the Sibyl, and\r\nconsecrated her as the servant of the Lord Jesus. And he was but a\r\nspecimen of the many _humanists_ of that age who believed that no\r\noracle that had once spoken to living men and women could ever wholly\r\nlose its vitality. Like the Delphic Pythia, old, but clothed as a\r\nmaiden, the ancient Sibyl appeared to them in the garments of\r\nimmortal youth, with the charm of her early prime.\r\n\r\nThe dim old church of Ara Coeli in Rome, which occupies the site of\r\nthe celebrated temple of Jupiter on the Capitol, and in which Gibbon\r\nconceived the idea of his great work on the _Decline and Fall of the\r\nRoman Empire_, is said to have derived its name from an altar bearing\r\nthe inscription, \"Ara Primogeniti Dei,\" erected in this place by\r\nAugustus, to commemorate the Sibylline prophecy of the coming of our\r\nSaviour. She was a favourite subject of Christian art in the middle\r\nages, and was introduced by almost every celebrated painter, along\r\nwith the prophets and apostles, into the cyclical decorations of the\r\nChurch. Every visitor to Rome knows the fine picture of the Sibyls by\r\nPinturicchio, on the tribune behind the high altar of the Church of\r\nSt. Onofrio, where Tasso was buried; and also the still grander head\r\nof the Cumæan Sibyl, with its flowing turban by Domenichino, in the\r\ngreat picture gallery of the Borghese Palace. But the highest honour\r\never conferred upon the Sibyls was that which Michael Angelo bestowed\r\nwhen he painted them on the spandrils of the wonderful roof of the\r\nSistine Chapel. These mysterious beings formed most congenial subjects\r\nfor the mystic pencil of the great Florentine, and therefore they are\r\nmore characteristic of his genius than almost any other of his works.\r\nHe has painted them along with the greater prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah,\r\nEzekiel, Daniel, Jonah, in throne-like niches surrounding the\r\ndifferent incidents of the creation. They look like presiding deities,\r\nremote from all human weaknesses, and wearing on their faces an air of\r\nprofound mystery. They are invested, not with the calm, superficial,\r\nunconscious beauty of pagan art, but with the solemn earnestness and\r\ntravail of soul characteristic of the Christian creed, wrinkled and\r\nsaddened with thought and worn out with vigils; and are striking\r\nexamples of the truth, that while each human being can bear his own\r\nburden, the burden of the world's mystery and pain crushes us to the\r\nearth. The Persian Sibyl, the oldest of the weird sisterhood, to whom\r\nthe sunset of life had given mystical lore, holds a book close to her\r\neyes, as if from dimness of vision; the Libyan Sibyl lifts a massive\r\nvolume above her head on to her knees; the Cumæan Sibyl intently reads\r\nher book at a distance from her dilated eyes; the Erythræan Sibyl,\r\nbareheaded, is about to turn over the page of her book; while the\r\nDelphic Sibyl, like Cassandra the youngest and most human-looking of\r\nthem all, holds a scroll in her hand, and gazes with a dreamy\r\nmournfulness into the far futurity. These splendid creations would\r\nabundantly reward the minute study of many days. They show how\r\nthoroughly the great painter had entered into the history and spirit\r\nof these mysterious prophetesses, who, while they bore the sins and\r\nsorrows of a corrupt world, had power to look for consolation into the\r\nsecrets of the future.\r\n\r\nVery beautiful was this reverence paid to the Sibyl amid all the\r\nidolatries of paganism and the corruptions of later Judaism. We may\r\nregard it as a relic of the early piety of the world. One who could\r\npass over the interests and distractions of her own time, and fix her\r\ngaze upon the distant future, must have seemed far removed from the\r\ncommon order of mankind, who live exclusively in the present, and can\r\nimagine no other or higher state of things than they see around them.\r\nStanding as the heirs of all the ages on this elevated vantage-ground\r\nand looking back upon the long course of the centuries--upon the\r\neventful future of the Sibyl, which is the past to us--it seems a\r\nmatter of course that the world should have spun down the ringing\r\ngrooves of change as it has done; and we fancy that this must have\r\nbeen obvious to the world's gray fathers. But though the age of the\r\nSibyl seemed the very threshold of time, there was nothing to indicate\r\nthis to her, nothing to show that she lived in the youth of the world,\r\nand that it was destined to ripen and expand with the process of the\r\nsuns. The same horizon that bounds us in these last days, bound her\r\nview in these early days; and things seemed as fully developed and\r\nstereotyped then as now, and to-morrow promised to be only a\r\nrepetition of to-day. To realise, therefore, that the world had a\r\nfuture, and to take the trouble of thinking what would happen a\r\nthousand years off, indicated no common habit of mind.\r\n\r\nAnd we are the more impressed by it when we consider the spots\r\nbewitched by the spell of Circe where it was exercised. That persons\r\ndwelling in lonely, northern isles, where the long wash of the waves\r\nupon the shore, and the wild wail of the wind in mountain corries\r\nstimulated the imagination, and seemed like voices from another world,\r\nshould see visions and dream dreams, does not surprise us. The power\r\nof second sight may seem natural to spots where nature is mysterious\r\nand solemn, and full of change and sudden transitions from storm to\r\ncalm and from sunshine to gloom. But at Cumæ there is a perpetual\r\npeace, an unchanging monotony. The same cloudless sky overarches the\r\nearth day after day, and dyes to celestial blue the same placid sea\r\nthat sleeps beside its shore. The fields are drowsy at noon with the\r\nsame stagnant sunshine; and the same purple glory lies at sunset on\r\nthe entranced hills; and the olive and the myrtle bloom through the\r\neven months with no fading or brightening tint on leaf or stem; and\r\neach day is the twin of that which has gone before. Nature in such a\r\nregion is transparent. No mist, or cloud, or shadow hides her secrets.\r\nThere is no subtle joy of despair and hope, of decay and growth,\r\nconnected with the passing of the seasons. In this Arcadian clime we\r\nshould expect Nature to lull the soul into the sleep of contentment on\r\nher lap; and in its perpetual summer happy shepherds might sing\r\neclogues for ever, and, satisfied with the present, have no hope or\r\nwish for the future. How wonderful, then, that in such a charmed\r\nlotus-land we should meet with the mysterious unrest of soul, and the\r\nfixed onward look of the Sibyl to times widely different from her\r\nown.\r\n\r\nAnd not only is this forward-looking gaze of the Sibyl contrary to\r\nwhat we should have expected in such a changeless land of beauty and\r\nease; it is also contrary to what we should have expected from the\r\npaganism of the people. It is characteristic of the Greek religion, as\r\nindeed of all heathen religions, that its golden age should be in the\r\npast. It instinctively clings to the memory of a former happier time,\r\nand shrinks from the unknown future. Its piety ever looks backward,\r\nand aspires to present safety or enjoyment by a faithful imitation of\r\nan imaginary past. It is always \"returning on the old well-worn path\r\nto the paradise of its childhood,\" and contrasting the gloom that\r\noverhangs the present with the radiance that shone on the morning\r\nlands. In every crisis of terror or disaster it turns with unutterable\r\nyearnings to the tradition of the happy age. Or, if it does look\r\nforward to the future, it always pictures \"the restoration of the old\r\nSaturnian reign\"; it has no standard of future excellence or future\r\nblessedness to attain to, and no yearnings for consummation and\r\nperfection hereafter. The very name given to the south of Italy was\r\nHesperia, the \"Land of the Evening Star,\" as if in token of its\r\nexhausted history; and it was regarded as the scene of the fabled\r\ngolden age from which Saturn and the ancient deities had been expelled\r\nby Jupiter. But contrary to this pagan instinct, the Cumæan Sibyl\r\nstretched forward to a distant heaven of her aspirations and hopes--to\r\na nobler future of the world, not sentimental and idyllic, but epic\r\nand heroic. She pictured the blessing or restoration of this earth\r\nitself as distinct from an invisible world of happiness. And in this\r\nrespect she is more in sympathy with the Jewish and Christian\r\nreligions than with her own. The golden age of the Hebrews was in the\r\nfuture, and was connected with the coming of the Messiah, who should\r\nrestore the kingdom again unto Israel. And the characteristic of the\r\nChristian religion is hope, the expectation of the times of the\r\nrestitution of all things, and the realisation of the \"one far-off\r\ndivine event to which the whole creation moves.\" It is this hopeful\r\nelement pervading them that gives to the lively oracles of Holy\r\nScripture the triumphant tone which distinguishes them so markedly\r\nfrom the desponding spirit of all false religions, ancient and modern.\r\n\r\nThe subject of the Sibyl brings us to the vexed question of the\r\nconnection between pagan and Hebrew prophecy. How are we to regard the\r\nvaticinations of the heathen oracle? That the great mass of the\r\nSibylline books is spurious is glaringly obvious. But there is a\r\nprimitive residuum which seems to remind us that the spirit of early\r\nprophecy still retained its hold over human nature amid all the\r\ncorruptions of heathendom, and secured for the Sibyl a sacred rank and\r\nauthority. We have seen with what reverence the greatest fathers of\r\nthe Christian Church regarded her. While there was undoubtedly much\r\ndelusion and deception, conscious or unconscious, mixed up with it, we\r\nare constrained at the same time to acknowledge that there was some\r\nreality in this prophetic element of paganism, which cannot be\r\nexplained away as the result of mere political or intellectual\r\nforesight or accidental coincidence. It was not all imposture. As a\r\nray of light is contained in all that shines, so a ray of God's truth\r\nwas reflected in what was best in this pagan prophecy. The fulfilment\r\nof many of the ancient oracles cannot be denied without a perversion\r\nof all history. There was no doubt an immense difference between the\r\nHebrew prophets and the pagan Sibyl. The predictions of the Sibyl were\r\naccompanied by strange fantastic circumstances, and wore the\r\nappearance of a blind caprice or arbitrary fate; whereas the\r\nannouncements of the Hebrew prophets, founded upon the denunciation of\r\nmoral evil and the reign of sacred and peremptory principles of\r\nrighteousness in the world, were calm, dignified, and self-consistent.\r\nBut we cannot, notwithstanding, deny to pagan prophecy some share in\r\nthe higher influence which inspired and moulded Hebrew prophecy. The\r\napostle of the Gentiles took this view when he called Epimenides the\r\nCretan a prophet. The Bible recognises the existence of true prophets\r\noutside the pale of the Jewish Church. Balaam, the son of Beor, was a\r\nheathen living in the mountains beyond the Euphrates; and yet the form\r\nas well as the substance of his prophecy was cast into the same mould\r\nas that of the Hebrew prophets. He is called in the Book of Numbers\r\n\"the man whose eyes are open;\" and God used this power as His organ of\r\nintercourse with and influence upon the world. The grand record of his\r\nvision is the first example of prophetic utterance respecting the\r\ndestinies of the world at large; and we see how the base and\r\ngrovelling nature of the man was overpowered by the irresistible force\r\nof the prophetic impulse within him, so that he was constrained to\r\nbless the enemies he was hired to curse. And in this respect he\r\nrepresents the purest of the ancient heathen oracles; and his answer\r\nto Balak breathes the very essence of prophetic inspiration, and is\r\nfar in advance of the spirit and thought of the time, reminding us of\r\nthe noble rebuke of the Cumæan Sibyl to Aristodicus, and of the oracle\r\nof Delphi to Glaucus.\r\n\r\nGod did not leave the Gentile nations without some glimpses of the\r\ntruth which He had revealed so fully and brightly to His own chosen\r\npeople. While He was the _glory_ of His people Israel, we must not\r\nforget that He was a light to lighten the Gentiles. He gave to them\r\noracles and sibyls, who had the \"open eye,\" and saw the vision of the\r\nyears, and witnessed to a light shining in the darkness, and brought\r\nGod nearer to a faithless world. Beneath the gross external polytheism\r\nof the multitude there were deep, primitive springs of godliness, pure\r\nand undefiled, working out their manifestation in noble lives; and\r\nthose who have ears to hear can listen to the sound of these ancient\r\nstreams as they flow into the river of life that makes glad the city\r\nof our God. We gain immensely by considering the prophetical spirit of\r\nIsrael as a typical endowment, and the training of the Jews in the\r\nhousehold of God, and under His own immediate eye, as the key to the\r\nright apprehension of the training of Greece and Rome. The unconscious\r\nprophecies of heathendom pointed in their own way, as well as the\r\narticulate divine prophecies of Israel, to the coming of Him who is\r\nthe Desire of all nations, and the true Light that lighteth every man\r\nthat cometh into the world. The wise men of Greece saw the sign of the\r\nSon of Man in some such way as the Magi saw the star in the East. They\r\nwere, according to Hegel's beautiful comparison, \"Memnons waiting for\r\nthe day.\" And not without deep significance did the female soothsayer\r\nfrom the oracle of Dionysius, the prophet-god of the Macedonians, whom\r\nPaul and Silas met when they first landed on European soil, greet them\r\nwith the words, \"These men are the servants of the most high God,\r\nwhich show unto us the way of salvation.\" In that wonderful confession\r\nwe recognise the last utterance of the oracle of Delphi and the Sibyl\r\nof Cumæ, as they were cast out by a higher and truer faith. Their\r\nmission was accomplished and their shrine deserted when God's way was\r\nknown upon the earth, and His saving health among all nations.\r\n\r\n    \"And now another Canaan yields\r\n    To thine all-conquering ark;\r\n    Fly from the 'old poetic fields,'\r\n    Ye Paynim shadows dark!\r\n    Immortal Greece, dear land of glorious lays,\r\n    Lo! here the unknown God of thine unconscious praise.\r\n\r\n    \"The olive wreath, the ivied wand,\r\n    'The sword in myrtles drest,'\r\n    Each legend of the shadowy strand\r\n    Now wakes a vision blest;\r\n    As little children lisp, and tell of heaven,\r\n    So thoughts beyond their thoughts to those high bards were given.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nFOOTPRINTS IN ROME\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the fork where a cross-road called the Via Ardeatina branches off\r\nfrom the Appian Way, is a little homely church with the strange name\r\nof \"Domine quo Vadis.\" It is associated with one of the most beautiful\r\nlegends of the early Christian Church touchingly told by St. Ambrose.\r\nThe Apostle Peter, fleeing from the persecution under Nero that arose\r\nafter the burning of Rome, came to this spot; and there he saw a\r\nvision of the Saviour bearing His cross with His face steadfastly set\r\nto go to the city. Filled with wonder and awe, the Apostle exclaimed,\r\n\"Domine quo Vadis,\" Lord, whither goest thou? To which the Saviour\r\nreplied, turning upon Peter the old look of mournful pity when he\r\ndenied Him in the High Priest's palace at Jerusalem, \"Venio Roman\r\niterum crucifigi,\" I go to Rome to be crucified a second time--and\r\nthen disappeared. Peter regarding this vision as an indication of his\r\nLord's mind, that he ought not to separate himself from the fortunes\r\nof his fellow-Christians, immediately turned back to the city, and met\r\nwith unflinching courage the martyr's death on the yellow sands of\r\nMontorio; being crucified with his head downwards, for he said he was\r\nnot worthy to die in the same way as his Master. This legend has been\r\nmade the subject of artistic treatment by Michael Angelo, whose famous\r\nstatue of our Lord as He appeared in the incident to St. Peter is in\r\nthe church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva, and was for many years a\r\nfavourite object of worship, until superseded by the predominant\r\nworship of Mary. A cast of this statue stands on the floor in front of\r\nthe altar in the church of Domine quo Vadis. It represents our Lord in\r\nthe character of a pilgrim, with a long cross in His hand, and an\r\neager onward look in His face and attitude. It is very simple and\r\nimpressive, and tells the story very effectually. Besides this plaster\r\nstatue of the Saviour, a circular stone is placed about the centre of\r\nthe building, surrounded by a low wooden railing, containing the\r\nprints of two feet side by side, impressed upon its surface, as if a\r\nperson had stopped short on a journey. These are said to be the\r\nmiraculous prints of the Saviour's feet on the pavement of the road\r\nwhen He appeared to Peter; but like the copy of Michael Angelo's\r\nstatue, this slab is a facsimile, the original stone being preserved\r\namong the relics of the neighbouring basilica of St. Sebastian.\r\nUnwilling as one is to disturb a legend so beautiful, and with so\r\ntouching a moral, there can be no doubt that it was an after-thought\r\nto account for the footprints; for the material on which they are\r\nimpressed being white marble, proves conclusively that the slab could\r\nnever have formed part of the pavement of the Appian Way, which it is\r\nwell known was composed of an unusually hard lava, found in a quarry\r\nnear the tomb of Cæcilia Metella; and the distinct marks of the chisel\r\nwhich the impressions bear--for I examined the original footprints\r\nvery carefully some years ago--indicate a very earthly origin indeed.\r\nThe traditional relic in all probability belonged to the early\r\nsubterranean cemetery--leading by a door out of the left aisle of the\r\nchurch of St. Sebastian, to which the name of Catacomb was originally\r\napplied.\r\n\r\nSlabs with footprints carved upon them are by no means rare in Rome.\r\nIn the Kircherian Museum, in the room devoted to early Christian\r\nantiquities, there is a square slab of white marble with two pairs of\r\nfootprints elegantly incised upon it, pointed in opposite directions,\r\nas if produced by a person going and returning, or by two persons\r\ncrossing each other. There is no record from what catacomb this\r\nsepulchral slab was taken. We have descriptions of other relics of the\r\nsame kind from the Roman Catacombs,--such as a marble slab bearing\r\nupon it the mark of the sole of a foot, with the words \"In Deo\"\r\nincised upon it at the one end, and at the other an inscription in\r\nGreek meaning \"Januaria in God\"; and a slab with a pair of footprints\r\ncarved on it covered with sandals, well executed, which was placed by\r\na devoted husband over the loculus or tomb of his wife. Impressions of\r\nfeet shod with shoes or sandals are much rarer than those of bare\r\nfeet; and a pair of feet is a more customary representation than a\r\nsingle foot, which, when carved, is usually in profile. In a dark,\r\nhalf-subterranean chapel, green with damp, belonging to the church of\r\nSt. Christina in the town of Bolsena, on the great Volscian Mere of\r\nMacaulay, there is a stone let into the front of the altar, and\r\nprotected by an iron grating, on which is rudely impressed a pair of\r\nmisshapen feet very like those in the church of St. Sebastian at Rome.\r\nIn the lower church at Assisi there is a duplicate of these\r\nfootprints. The legend connected with them says that they were\r\nproduced by the feet of a Christian lady named Christina, living in\r\nthe neighbourhood in pagan times, who was thrown into the adjoining\r\nlake by her persecutors, with a large flat stone attached to her body.\r\nInstead of sinking her, the stone formed a raft which floated her in a\r\nstanding attitude safely to the opposite shore, where she\r\nlanded--leaving the prints of her feet upon the stone as an\r\nincontestable proof of the reality of the miracle. The altar with\r\nwhich the slab is engrafted--with a stone _baldacchino_ over it--I may\r\nmention, was the scene of the famous miracle of Bolsena, when a\r\nBohemian priest, officiating here in 1263, was cured of his sceptical\r\ndoubts regarding the reality of transubstantiation by the sudden\r\nappearance of drops of blood on the Host which he had just\r\nconsecrated--an incident which formed the subject of Raphael's\r\nwell-known picture in the Vatican, and in connection with which Pope\r\nUrban IV. instituted the festival of Corpus Christi. On the Lucanian\r\ncoast, near the little fishing town of Agrapoli, not far from Pæstum,\r\nthere is shown on the limestone rock the print of a foot which is said\r\nby the inhabitants to have been made by the Apostle Paul, who lingered\r\nhere on his way to Rome. In the famous church of Radegonde at\r\nPoitiers, dedicated to the queen of Clothaire I.--who afterwards took\r\nthe veil, and was distinguished for her piety--there is shown on a\r\nwhite marble slab a well-defined footmark, which is called \"Le pas de\r\nDieu,\" and is said to indicate the spot where the Saviour appeared to\r\nthe tutelary saint of the place. Near the altar of the church of St.\r\nGenaro de Poveri in Naples, Mary's foot is shown suspended in a glazed\r\nframe. In the middle of the footprint there is an oval figure with the\r\nold initials of mother, water, matter. The footprint of Mary is very\r\ncommon in churches in Italy and Spain, where it is highly venerated.\r\n\r\nThe significance of these footmarks has been the subject of much\r\ncontroversy. Some have regarded them as symbols of possession--the\r\nword \"possession\" being supposed to be etymologically derived from the\r\nLatin words _pedis positio_, and meaning literally the position of the\r\nfoot. The adage of the ancient jurists was, \"Quicquid pes tuus\r\ncalcaverit tuum erit.\" The symbol of a foot was carved on the marble\r\nslab that closed the _loculus_ or tomb, to indicate that it was the\r\npurchased property of the person who reposed in it. This view,\r\nhowever, has not been generally received with favour by the most\r\ncompetent authorities. A more plausible theory is that which regards\r\nthe sepulchral footmarks in the Catacombs as votive offerings of\r\ngratitude, ordered by Christians to be made in commemoration of the\r\ncompletion of their earthly pilgrimage. It was a common pagan custom\r\nfor persons who had recovered from disease or injury, to hang up as\r\nthankofferings in the shrines of the gods who were supposed to have\r\nhealed them, images or representations, moulded in metal, clay, or\r\nwood, of the part that had been affected. In Italy, votive tablets\r\nwere dedicated to Iris and Hygiea on which footmarks were engraved;\r\nand Hygiea received on one occasion tributes of this kind which\r\nrecorded the gratitude of some Roman soldiers who escaped the\r\namputation which was inflicted upon their comrades by Hannibal. This\r\ncustom survived in the early Christian Church, and is still kept up,\r\nas any one who visits a modern shrine of pilgrimage in Roman Catholic\r\ncountries can testify. Among such votive offerings, models and carved\r\nand painted representations of feet in stone, or wood, or metal, are\r\nfrequently suspended before the image of the Madonna, in gratitude for\r\nrecovery from some disease of the feet. We may suppose that as the\r\nancient Romans, when they returned safely from some long and dangerous\r\nor difficult journey undertaken for business or health, dedicated in\r\ngratitude a representation of their feet to their favourite god--so\r\nthe early Christians, who in their original condition were pagans, and\r\nstill cherished many of their old customs, ordered these peculiar\r\nfootmarks to be made upon their graves, in token of thankfulness that\r\nfor them the pilgrimage of life was over, and the endless rest begun.\r\nThere can be little doubt that the slab with the so-called footprints\r\nof St. Christina on it at Bolsena, already alluded to, was a pagan\r\nex-votive offering; for the altar on which it is engrafted occupies\r\nthe site of one anciently dedicated to Apollo, and the legend of St.\r\nChristina gradually crystallised around it. And the footprint in the\r\nchurch of Radegonde at Poitiers was more likely pagan than Christian,\r\nfor Poitiers had a Roman origin, and numerous Roman remains have been\r\nfound in the town and neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nA long and curious list might be made of the miraculous impressions\r\nsaid to have been left by our Saviour's feet on the places where He\r\nstood. In the centre of the platform at Jerusalem on which the Temple\r\nof Solomon stood, covered by the dome of the Sakrah Mosque, a portion\r\nof the rough natural limestone rock rises several feet above the\r\nmarble pavement, and is the principal object of veneration in the\r\nplace. It has an excavated chamber in one corner, with an aperture\r\nthrough the rocky roof, which has given to the rock the name of \"lapis\r\npertusus,\" or perforated stone. On this rock there are natural or\r\nartificial marks, which the successors of the Caliph Omar believed to\r\nbe the prints of the angel Gabriel's fingers, and the mark of\r\nMohammed's foot, and that of his camel, which performed the whole\r\njourney from Mecca to Jerusalem in four bounds. The stone, it is said,\r\noriginally fell from heaven, and was used as a seat by the venerable\r\nprophets of Jerusalem. So long as they enjoyed the gift of prophecy,\r\nthe stone remained steady under them; but when the gift was withdrawn,\r\nand the persecuted seers were compelled to flee for safety to other\r\nlands, the stone rose to accompany them: whereupon the angel Gabriel\r\ninterposed, and prevented the departure of the prophetical chair,\r\nleaving on it indelibly the marks of his fingers. It was then\r\nsupernaturally nailed to its rocky bed by seven brass nails. When any\r\ngreat crisis in the world's fortunes happens, the head of one of these\r\nnails disappears; and when they are all gone, the day of judgment will\r\ncome. There are now only three left, and therefore the Mohammedans\r\nbelieve that the end of all things is not far off. When the Crusaders\r\ntook possession of the sacred city, they altered the Mohammedan\r\nlegend, and attributed the mysterious footprint to our Lord when He\r\nwent out of the Temple to escape the fury of the Jews. There can be no\r\ndoubt that the marks on the rock are prehistoric, and belong to the\r\nprimitive worship of Mount Moriah, long before the august associations\r\nof Biblical history gathered around it. To this spot the Jews used to\r\ncome in the fourth century and wail over the rock, and _anoint it\r\nwith oil_, as if carrying out some dim tradition of former primitive\r\nlibations.\r\n\r\nIn the Octagon Chapel of the Church of the Ascension on the top of the\r\nMount of Olives, so well known for the magnificent view which it\r\ncommands of Jerusalem and the Dead Sea, is shown the native rock which\r\nforms the summit of the hill from which our Lord ascended into heaven.\r\nOn this rock, it is said by tradition, He left the mark of His\r\nfootsteps. Arculf, who visited Palestine about the year 700, says: \"On\r\nthe ground in the midst of the church are to be seen the last prints\r\nin the dust of our Lord's feet, and the roof appears above where He\r\nascended; and although the earth is daily carried away by believers,\r\nyet still it remains as before, and retains the same impression of the\r\nfeet.\" Jerome mentions that in his time the same custom was observed,\r\nfollowed by the same singular result. Later writers, however, asserted\r\nthat the impressions were made, not in the ground, or in the dust, but\r\non the solid rock; and that originally there were two, one of them\r\nhaving been stolen long ago by the Mohammedans, who broke off the\r\nfragment of stone on which it was stamped. Sir John Mandeville\r\ndescribes the appearance of the surviving footmark as it looked in his\r\nday, 1322: \"From that mount our Lord Jesus Christ ascended to heaven\r\non Ascension Day, and yet there appears the impress of His left foot\r\nin the stone.\" What is now seen in the place is a simple rude cavity\r\nin the natural rock, which bears but the slightest resemblance to the\r\nhuman foot. It may have been artificially sculptured, or it may be\r\nonly one of those curious hollows into which limestone rocks are\r\nfrequently weathered. In either case it naturally lent itself to the\r\nsacred legend that has gathered around it.\r\n\r\nIn the Kaaba, the most ancient and remarkable building of the great\r\nMosque at Mecca, is preserved a miraculous stone with the print of\r\nAbraham's feet impressed upon it. It is said, by Mohammedan\r\ntradition, to be the identical stone which served the patriarch as a\r\nscaffold when he helped Ishmael to rebuild the Kaaba, which had been\r\noriginally constructed by Seth, and was afterwards destroyed by the\r\nDeluge. While Abraham stood upon this stone, it rose and sank with him\r\nas he built the walls of the sacred edifice. The relic is said to be a\r\nfragment of the same gray Mecca stone of which the whole building is\r\nconstructed,--in this respect differing from the famous black stone\r\nbrought to Abraham and Ishmael by the angel Gabriel, and built into\r\nthe north-east corner of the exterior wall of the Kaaba, which is said\r\nby scientific men to be either a meteorite or fragment of volcanic\r\nbasalt. It is popularly supposed to have been originally a jacinth of\r\ndazzling whiteness, but to have been made black as ink by the touch of\r\nsinful man, and that it can only recover its original purity and\r\nbrilliancy at the day of judgment. The millions of kisses and touches\r\nimpressed by the faithful have worn the surface considerably; but in\r\naddition to this, traces of cup-shaped hollows have been observed on\r\nit. There can be no doubt that both these relics associated with\r\nAbraham are of high antiquity, and may have belonged to the\r\nprehistoric worship which marked Mecca as a sacred site, long before\r\nthe followers of the Prophet had set up their shrine there. In the\r\nsacred Mosque of Hebron, built over the cave of Machpelah, is pointed\r\nout a footprint of the ordinary size on a slab of stone, variously\r\ncalled that of Adam or of Mohammed. It is said to have been brought\r\nfrom Mecca some six hundred years ago, and is enclosed in a recess at\r\nthe back of the shrine of Abraham, where it is placed on a sort of\r\nshelf about three feet above the floor. On the margin of the tank, in\r\nthe court of the ruined mosque at Baalbec, there are shown four giant\r\nfootmarks, which are supposed to have been impressed by some patriarch\r\nor prophet, but are more likely to have been connected with the\r\nancient religion of Canaan, which lingered here to the latest days of\r\nRoman paganism. In the great Druse shrine of Neby Schaib near Hattin\r\nthere is a square block of limestone in the centre of which is a piece\r\nof alabaster containing the imprint of a human foot of natural size,\r\nwith the toes very clearly defined. The Druses reverently kiss this\r\nimpression, asserting that the rock exudes moisture, and that it is\r\nnever dry. There is a split in the rock across the centre of the\r\nfootprint, which they account for by saying that when the prophet\r\nstepped here he split the rock with his tread. In Damascus there was\r\nat one time a sacred building called the Mosque of the Holy Foot, in\r\nwhich there was a stone having upon it the print of the feet of Moses.\r\nIbn Batuta saw this curious relic early in the fourteenth century; but\r\nboth the mosque and the stone have since disappeared. On the eastern\r\nside of the Jordan a Bedouin tribe, called the Adwân, worship the\r\nprint left on a stone by the roadside by a prophetess while mounting\r\nher camel, in order to proceed on a pilgrimage to Mecca. The Kadriyeh\r\ndervishes of Egypt adore a gigantic shoe, as an emblem of the sacred\r\nfoot of the founder of their sect; and near Madura, a large leather\r\nshoe is offered in worship to a deity that, like Diana, presides over\r\nthe chase.\r\n\r\nTo the student of comparative religion the Phrabat, or Sacred Foot of\r\nBuddha, opens up a most interesting field of investigation. In the\r\nEast, impressions of the feet of this wonderful person are as common\r\nas those of Christ and the Virgin Mary in the West. Buddhists are\r\ncontinually increasing the number by copies of the originals; and\r\nnative painters of Siam who are ambitious of distinction often present\r\nthese sacred objects to the king, adorned with the highest skill of\r\ntheir art, as the most acceptable gift they can offer. The sacred\r\nfootprint enters into the very essence of the Buddhist religion; it\r\nclaims from the Indo-Chinese nations a degree of veneration scarcely\r\nyielding to that which they pay to Buddha himself. It is very ancient,\r\nand was framed to embody in one grand symbol a complete system of\r\ntheology and theogony, which has been gradually forgotten or perverted\r\nby succeeding ages to the purposes of a ridiculous superstition. It is\r\nelaborately carved and painted with numerous symbols, each of which\r\nhas a profound significance. The liturgy of the Siamese connected with\r\nit consists of fifty measured lines of eight syllables each, and\r\ncontains the names of a hundred and eight distinct symbolical\r\nobjects,--such as the lion, the elephant, the sun and moon in their\r\ncars drawn by oxen, the horse, the serpents, the spiral building, the\r\ntree, the six spheres, the five lakes, and the altar--all of which are\r\nrepresented on the foot. This list of symbolical allusions is recited\r\nby the priests, and forms an essential part of the ritual of worship.\r\nThe Siamese priests say that any mortal about to arrive at the\r\nthreshold of Nivána has his feet emblazoned spontaneously with all the\r\nsymbols to be seen on the Phrabat.\r\n\r\nThe Siamese acknowledge only five genuine Phrabats made by the actual\r\nfeet of Buddha. They are called the Five Impressions of the Divine\r\nFoot. The first is on a rock on the coast of the peninsula of Malacca,\r\nwhere, beside the mark of Buddha's foot, there is also one of a dog's\r\nfoot, which is much venerated by the natives. The second Phrabat is on\r\nthe Golden Mountain, the hill with the holy footstep of Buddha, in\r\nSiam, which Buddha visited on one occasion. The impression is that of\r\nthe right foot, and is covered with a maradop, a pyramidal canopy\r\nsupported by gilded pilasters. The hollow of the footstep is generally\r\nfilled with water, which the devotee sprinkles over his body to wash\r\naway the stain of his sin. The third Phrabat is on a hill on the banks\r\nof the Jumna, in the midst of an extensive and deep forest, which\r\nspreads over broken ranges of hills. The Phrabat is on a raised\r\nterrace, like that on which most of the Buddhist temples are built.\r\nThe pyramidal structure which shelters it is of hewn stone ninety feet\r\nhigh, and is like the _baldacchino_ of a Roman Catholic church. There\r\nare four impressions on different terraces, each rising above the\r\nother, corresponding to the four descents of the deity. The fourth\r\nPhrabat is also on the banks of the Jumna. But the fifth and most\r\ncelebrated of all is the print of the sacred foot on the top of the\r\nAmala Sri Pada, or Adam's Peak, in Ceylon. On the highest point of\r\nthis hill there is a pagoda-like building, supported on slender\r\npillars, and open on every side to the winds. Underneath this canopy,\r\nin the centre of a huge mass of gneiss and hornblende, forming the\r\nliving rock, there is the rude outline of a gigantic foot about five\r\nfeet long, and of proportionate breadth.\r\n\r\nSir Emerson Tennent, who has given a full and interesting account of\r\nthis last Phrabat in his work on Ceylon, supposes that it was\r\noriginally a natural hollow in the rock, afterwards artificially\r\nenlarged and shaped into its present appearance; but whatever may have\r\nbeen its origin at first, its present shape is undoubtedly of great,\r\nperhaps prehistoric, antiquity. In the sacred books of the Buddhists\r\nit is referred to, upwards of three hundred years before Christ, as\r\nthe impression left of Buddha's foot when he visited the earth after\r\nthe Deluge, with gifts and blessings for his worshippers; and in the\r\nfirst century of the Christian era it is recorded that a king of\r\nCashmere went on a pilgrimage to Ceylon for the express purpose of\r\nadoring this _Sri-pada_, or Sacred Footprint. The Gnostics of the\r\nfirst Christian centuries attributed it to Ieu, the first man; and in\r\none of the oldest manuscripts in existence, now in the British\r\nMuseum--the Coptic version of the \"Faithful Wisdom,\" said to have been\r\nwritten by the great Gnostic philosopher Valentinus in the fourth\r\ncentury--there is mention made of this venerable relic, the Saviour\r\nbeing said to inform the Virgin Mary that He has appointed the Spirit\r\nKalapataraoth as guardian over it. From the Gnostics the Mohammedans\r\nreceived the tradition; for they believe that when Adam was expelled\r\nfrom Paradise he lived many years on this mountain alone, before he\r\nwas reunited to Eve on Mount Arafath, which overhangs Mecca. The early\r\nPortuguese settlers in the island attributed the sacred footprint to\r\nSt. Thomas, who is said by tradition to have preached the Gospel,\r\nafter the ascension of Christ, in Persia and India, and to have\r\nsuffered martyrdom at Malabar, where he founded the Christian Church,\r\nwhich still goes by the name of the Christians of St. Thomas; and they\r\nbelieved that all the trees on the mountain, and for half a league\r\nround about its base, bent their crowns in the direction of this\r\nsacred object--a mark of respect which they affirmed could only be\r\noffered to the footstep of an apostle. The Brahmins have appropriated\r\nthe sacred mark as the footprint of their goddess Siva. At the present\r\nday the Buddhists are the guardians of the shrine; but the worshippers\r\nof other creeds are not prevented from paying their homage at it, and\r\nthey meet in peace and goodwill around the object of their common\r\nadoration. By this circumstance the Christian visitor is reminded of\r\nthe sacred footprint, already alluded to, on the rock of the Church of\r\nthe Ascension on the Mount of Olives, which is part of a mosque, and\r\nhas five altars for the Greek, Latin, Armenian, Syrian, and Coptic\r\nChurches, all of whom climb the hill on Ascension Day to celebrate the\r\nfestival; the Mohammedans, too, coming in and offering their prayers\r\nat the same shrine. The worship paid on the mountain of the sacred\r\nfoot in Ceylon consists of offerings of the crimson flowers of the\r\nrhododendron, which grow freely among the crags around, accompanied by\r\nvarious genuflections and shoutings, and concluding with the striking\r\nof an ancient bell, and a draught from the sacred well which springs\r\nup a little below the summit. These ceremonies point to a very\r\nprimitive mode of worship; and it is probable that, as Adam's Peak was\r\nvenerated from a remote antiquity by the aborigines of Ceylon, being\r\nconnected by them with the worship of the sun, the sacred footprint\r\nmay belong to this prehistoric cult. Models of the footprint are shown\r\nin various temples in Ceylon.\r\n\r\nBesides these five great Phrabats, there are others of inferior\r\ncelebrity in the East. In the P'hra Pathom of the Siamese, Buddha is\r\nsaid to have left impressions of his feet at Lauca and Chakravan. At\r\nAva there is a Phrabat near Prome which is supposed to be a type of\r\nthe creation. Another is seen in the same country on a large rock\r\nlying amidst the hills a day's journey west of Meinbu. Dr. Leyden says\r\nthat it is in the country of the Lan that all the celebrated founders\r\nof the religion of Buddha are reported to have left their most\r\nremarkable vestiges. The traces of the sacred foot are sparingly\r\nscattered over Pegu, Ava, and Arracan. But among the Lan they are\r\nconcentrated; and thither devotees repair to worship at the sacred\r\nsteps of Pra Kukuson, Pra Konnakan, Pra Puttakatsop, and Pra\r\nSamutacadam.\r\n\r\nThe footsteps of Vishnu are also frequent in India. Sir William Jones\r\ntells us that in the Puranas mention is made of a white mountain on\r\nwhich King Sravana sat meditating on the divine foot of Vishnu at the\r\nstation Trevirana. When the Hindoos entered into possession of\r\nGayá--one of the four most sacred places of Buddhism--they found the\r\npopular feeling in favour of the sacred footprint there so strong that\r\nthey were obliged to incorporate the relic into their own religious\r\nsystem, and to attribute it to Vishnu. Thousands of Hindoo pilgrims\r\nfrom all parts of India now visit the shrine every year. Indeed to the\r\nworshippers of Vishnu the Temple of Vishnupad at Gayá is one of the\r\nmost holy in all India; and as we are informed in the great work of\r\nDr. Mitra, the later religious books earnestly enjoin that no one\r\nshould fail, at least once in his lifetime, to visit the spot. They\r\ncommend the wish for numerous offspring on the ground that, out of the\r\nmany, one son might visit Gayá, and by performing the rites prescribed\r\nin connection with the holy footstep, rescue his father from eternal\r\ndestruction. The stone is a large hemispherical block of granite, with\r\nan uneven top, bearing the carvings of two human feet. The frequent\r\nwashings which it daily undergoes have worn out the peculiar\r\nsectorial marks which the feet contain, and even the outlines of the\r\nfeet themselves are but dimly perceptible. English architects are now\r\nengaged in preserving the ruins of the splendid temple associated with\r\nthis footprint, where the ministry of India's great teacher--the\r\n\"Light of Asia\"--began. In the Indian Museum at Calcutta there is a\r\nlarge slab of white marble bearing the figure of a human foot\r\nsurrounded by two dragons. It was brought from a temple in Burmah,\r\nwhere it used to be worshipped as a representation of Buddha's foot.\r\nIt is seven inches long and three inches broad, and is divided into a\r\nhundred and eight compartments, each of which contains a different\r\nmystical mark.\r\n\r\nAt Gangautri, on the banks of the Ganges, is a wooden temple\r\ncontaining a footprint of Ganga on a black stone. In a strange\r\nsubterranean temple, inside the great fort at Allahabad, there are two\r\nfootprints of Vishnu, along with footprints of Rama, and of his wife\r\nSita. In India the \"kaddam rassul,\" or supposed impression of\r\nMohammed's foot in clay, which is kept moist, and enclosed in a sort\r\nof cage, is not unfrequently placed at the head of the gravestones of\r\nthe followers of Islam. On the summit of a mountain one hundred and\r\nthirty-six miles south of Bhagalpur is one of the principal places of\r\nJain worship in India. On the table-land are twenty small Jain temples\r\non different craggy heights, which resemble an extinguisher in shape.\r\nIn each of them is to be found the Vasu Padukas--a sacred foot similar\r\nto that which is seen in the Jain temple at Champanagar. The sect of\r\nthe Jain in South Bihar has two places of pilgrimage. One is a tank\r\nchoked with weeds and lotus-flowers, which has a small island in the\r\ncentre containing a temple, with two stones in the interior, on one of\r\nwhich is an inscription and the impression of the two feet of\r\nGautama--the most common object of worship of the Jains in this\r\ndistrict. The other is the place in the same part of the country where\r\nthe body of Mahavira, one of the twenty-four lawgivers, was burnt\r\nabout six centuries before Christ. It resembles the other temple, and\r\nis situated in an island in a tank. The island is terraced round, and\r\nin the cavity of the beehive-like top there is the representation of\r\nMahavira's feet, to which crowds of pilgrims are continually flocking.\r\nIn the centre of the Jain temple at Puri, where this remarkable man\r\ndied, there are also three representations of his feet, and one\r\nimpression of the feet of each of his eleven disciples.\r\n\r\nBut the subject of footprints carries us farther back than the ages of\r\nthe great historic founders of religion. In almost every part of the\r\nearth footprints have been found, cut in the solid rock or impressed\r\nupon boulders and other stones. These artificial tracks, like the\r\nstrange human footprint which Robinson Crusoe discovered on the beach\r\nof his lonely island, excite the imagination by their mystery, and\r\nopen up a vista into a hitherto unexplored world of infinite\r\nsuggestion. They seem the natural successors of those tracks of birds\r\nand reptiles on sandstone and other slabs which form one of the most\r\ninteresting features in every geological museum; the material on which\r\nthey are impressed having allowed the substantial forms of the\r\ncreatures themselves to disappear, while it has carefully preserved\r\nthe more shadowy and incidental memorials of their life. The\r\nnaturalist can tell us from the ephemeral impressions on the soft\r\nprimeval mud, not only what was the true nature of the obscure\r\ncreatures that produced them untold ages ago, but also the direction\r\nin which they were moving along the shore, and the state of the tide\r\nand the weather, and the appearance of the country at the time. But\r\nregarding those literal human \"footprints on the sands of time,\" which\r\nhave been left behind by our prehistoric ancestors, we can make no\r\nsuch accurate scientific inductions. They have given rise to much\r\nspeculation, being considered by many persons to be real impressions\r\nof human feet, dating from a time when the material on which they were\r\nstamped was still in a state of softness. Superstition has invested\r\nthem with a sacred veneration, and legends of a wild and mystical\r\ncharacter have gathered around them. The slightest acquaintance with\r\nthe results of geological research has sufficed to dispel this\r\ndelusion, and to show that these mysterious marks could not have been\r\nproduced by human beings while the rocks were in a state of fusion;\r\nand consequently no intelligent observer now holds this theory of\r\ntheir origin. But superstition dies hard; and there are persons who,\r\nthough confronted with the clearest evidences of science, still refuse\r\nto abandon their old obscurantist ideas. They prefer a supernatural\r\ntheory that allows free scope to their fancy and religious instinct,\r\nto one that offers a more prosaic explanation. There is a charm in the\r\nmystery connected with these dim imaginings which they would not wish\r\ndispelled by the clear daylight of scientific knowledge. In our own\r\ncountry, footmarks on rocks and stones are by no means of unfrequent\r\noccurrence. Some of them, indeed, although associated with myths and\r\nfairy tales, have doubtless been produced by natural causes, being the\r\nmere chance effects of weathering, without any meaning except to a\r\ngeologist. But there are others that have been unmistakably produced\r\nby artificial means, and have a human history and significance.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland Tanist stones--so called from the Gaelic word _tanaiste_,\r\na chief, or the next heir to an estate--have been frequently found.\r\nThese stones were used in connection with the coronation of a king or\r\nthe inauguration of a chief. The custom dates from the remotest\r\nantiquity. We see traces of it in the Bible,--as when it is mentioned\r\nthat \"Abimelech was made king by the oak of the pillar that was in\r\nShechem\"; and \"Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the\r\nstone of Zoheleth, which is by En-rogel, and called all his brethren\r\nthe king's sons, and all the men of Judah the king's servants\"; and\r\nthat when Joash was anointed king by Jehoiada, \"the king stood by a\r\npillar, as the manner was\"; and again, King Josiah \"stood by a\r\npillar\" to make a covenant, \"and all the people stood to the\r\ncovenant.\" The stone connected with the ceremony was regarded as the\r\nmost sacred attestation of the engagement entered into between the\r\nnewly-elected king or chief and his people. It was placed in some\r\nconspicuous position, upon the top of a \"moot-hill,\" or the open-air\r\nplace of assembly. Upon it was usually carved an impression of a human\r\nfoot; and into this impression, during the ceremony of inauguration,\r\nthe king or chief placed his own right foot, in token that he was\r\ninstalled by right into the possessions of his predecessors, and that\r\nhe would walk in their footsteps. It may be said literally, that in\r\nthis way the king or chief came to an understanding with his people;\r\nand perhaps the common saying of \"stepping into a dead man's shoes\"\r\nmay have originated from this primitive custom.\r\n\r\nThe most famous of the Tanist stones is the Coronation-stone in\r\nWestminster Abbey--the Lia Fail, or Stone of Destiny--on which the\r\nancient kings of Scotland sat or stood when crowned, and which forms a\r\nsingular link of connection between the primitive rites that entered\r\ninto the election of a king by the people, and the gorgeous ceremonies\r\nby which the hereditary sovereigns of England are installed into their\r\nhigh office. There is no footmark, however, on this stone. It may be\r\nmentioned that before the arrival of the Scottish stone there had been\r\nfor ages a similar stone at Westminster Hall, which gave the name to\r\nand was the original place of sitting for the Court of King's Bench.\r\nIt was no doubt a relic of the primitive Folkmoot of Westminster,\r\nwhich has developed into the Parliament of England. In the\r\nneighbourhood of Upsala is the Mora stone, celebrated in Swedish\r\nhistory as the spot where the kings were publicly elected and received\r\nthe homage of their subjects.\r\n\r\nA more characteristic specimen of a Tanist stone may be seen on the\r\ntop of Dun Add, a rocky isolated hill about two hundred feet high, in\r\nArgyleshire, not far from Ardrishaig. On a smooth flat piece of rock\r\nwhich protrudes above the surface there is carved the mark of a right\r\nfoot, covered with the old _cuaran_ or thick stocking, eleven inches\r\nlong and four inches and a half broad at the widest part, the heel\r\nbeing an inch less. It is sunk about half an inch in the rock, and is\r\nvery little weather-worn--the reason being, perhaps, that it has been\r\nprotected for ages by the turf that has grown over it, and has only\r\nrecently been exposed. Quite close to it is a smooth polished basin,\r\neleven inches in diameter and eight deep, also scooped out of the\r\nrock. With these two curious sculptures is associated a local myth.\r\nOssian, who lived for a time in the neighbourhood, was one day hunting\r\non the mountain above Loch Fyne. A stag which his dogs had brought to\r\nbay charged him, and he fled precipitately. Coming to the hill above\r\nKilmichael, he strode in one step across the valley to the top of\r\nRudal Hill, from whence he took a gigantic leap to the summit of Dun\r\nAdd. But when he alighted he was somewhat exhausted by his great\r\neffort, and fell on his knee, and stretched out his hands to prevent\r\nhim from falling backwards. He thereupon left on the rocky top of Dun\r\nAdd the enduring impression of his feet and knee which we see at the\r\npresent day. This myth is of comparatively recent date, and is\r\ninteresting as showing that all recollection of the original use of\r\nthe footmark and basin had died away for many ages in the district.\r\nThere can be no doubt that the footmark indicates the spot to have\r\nbeen at one time the scene of the inauguration of the kings or chiefs\r\nof the region; and the basin was in all probability one of those\r\nprimitive mortars which were in use for grinding corn long before the\r\ninvention of the quern. Dun Add is one of the oldest sites in\r\nScotland. It has the hoary ruins of a nameless fort, and a well which\r\nis traditionally said to ebb and flow with the tide. It was here that\r\nthe Dalriadic Scots first settled; and Captain Thomas, who is an\r\nauthority on this subject, supposes that the remarkable relic on Dun\r\nAdd was made for the inauguration of Fergus More Mac Erca, the first\r\nking of Dalriada, who died in Scotland at the beginning of the sixth\r\ncentury, and to have been the exact measure of his foot.\r\n\r\nKing in his _Munimenta Antiqua_ mentions that in the island of Islay\r\nthere was on a mound or hill where the high court of judicature sat, a\r\nlarge stone fixed, about seven feet square, in which there was a\r\ncavity or deep impression made to receive the feet of Macdonald, who\r\nwas crowned King of the Isles standing on this stone, and swore that\r\nhe would continue his vassals in the possession of their lands, and do\r\nimpartial justice to all his subjects. His father's sword was then put\r\ninto his hand, and the Bishop of Argyle and seven priests anointed him\r\nking in presence of all the heads of the tribes in the Isles and\r\nmainland, and at the same time an orator rehearsed a catalogue of his\r\nancestors. In the year 1831, when a mound locally known as the \"Fairy\r\nKnowe,\" in the parish of Carmylie, Forfarshire, was levelled in the\r\ncourse of some agricultural improvements in the place, there was\r\nfound, besides stone cists and a bronze ring, a rude boulder almost\r\ntwo tons in weight, on the under side of which was sculptured the mark\r\nof a human foot. The mound or tumulus was in all likelihood a\r\nmoot-hill, where justice was dispensed and the chieftains of the\r\ndistrict were elected. In the same county, in the wild recesses of\r\nGlenesk, near Lord Dalhousie's shooting-lodge of Milldam, there is a\r\nrough granite boulder, on the upper surface of which a small human\r\nfoot is scooped out with considerable accuracy, showing traces even of\r\nthe toes. It is known in the glen as the \"Fairy's Footmark.\" There can\r\nbe no doubt that this stone was once used in connection with the\r\nceremonial of inaugurating a chief.\r\n\r\nA similar stone, carved with a representation of two feet, on which\r\nthe primitive chiefs stood when publicly invested with the insignia of\r\noffice, is still, or was lately, in existence in Ladykirk, at Burwick,\r\nSouth Ronaldshay, Orkney. A local tradition, that originated long\r\nafter the Pictish chiefs passed away, and a new Norse race, ignorant\r\nof the customs of their predecessors, came in, says that the stone in\r\nquestion was used by St. Magnus as a boat to ferry him over the\r\nPentland Firth; while an earlier tradition looked upon it as a\r\nmiraculous whale which opportunely appeared at the prayer of the saint\r\nwhen about to be overwhelmed by a storm, and carried him on its back\r\nsafely to the shore, where it was converted into a stone, as a\r\nperpetual memorial of the marvellous occurrence. In North Yell,\r\nShetland, there is a rude stone lying on the hillside, on which is\r\nsculptured with considerable skill the mark of a human foot. It is\r\nknown in the district as the \"Giant's Step\"; another of the same kind,\r\nit is said, being over in Unst. It is undoubtedly the stone on which,\r\nin Celtic times, the native kings of this part were crowned. About a\r\nmile from Keill, near Campbeltown, a very old site, closely connected\r\nwith the early ecclesiastical history of Scotland, may be seen on a\r\nrock what is locally called the \"Footprint of St. Columba,\" which he\r\nmade when he landed on this shore on one occasion from Iona. It is\r\nvery rude and much effaced; but it carries the imagination much\r\nfarther back than the days of St. Columba,--when a pagan chief or king\r\nwas inaugurated here to rule over the district.\r\n\r\nIn England and Wales there are several interesting examples of\r\nfootprints on boulders and rocks. A remarkable Tanist stone--which,\r\nhowever, has no carving upon it, I believe--stands, among a number of\r\nother and smaller boulders, on the top of a hill near the village of\r\nLong Compton, in Cumberland. It is called \"The King\"; and the popular\r\nrhyme of the country people--\r\n\r\n    \"If Long Compton thou canst see,\r\n    Then king of England thou shalt be\"--\r\n\r\npoints to the fact that the stone must have been once used as a\r\ncoronation-stone. Not far from the top of a hill near Barmouth in\r\nWales, in the middle of a rough path, may be seen a flat stone, in\r\nwhich there is a footmark about the natural size, locally known as\r\n\"Llan Maria,\" or Mary's step, because the Virgin Mary once, it is\r\nsupposed, put her foot on this rock, and then walked down the hill to\r\na lower height covered with roots of oak-trees. This impression on the\r\nstone is associated with several stone circles and cromlechs--one of\r\nwhich bears upon it the reputed marks of Arthur's fingers, and is\r\ncalled Arthur's Quoit--and with a spring of water and a grove, as the\r\npath leading to the hill is still known by a Welsh name which means\r\nGrove Lane; and these associations undoubtedly indicate that the spot\r\nwas once a moot-hill or prehistoric sanctuary, where religious and\r\ninauguration rites were performed. At Smithhill's Hall, near\r\nBolton-le-Moors, there is still to be seen an object of curiosity to a\r\nlarge number of visitors--the print of a man's foot in the flagstone.\r\nIt is said to have been produced by George Marsh, who suffered\r\nmartyrdom during the persecutions of Queen Mary in 1555. When on one\r\noccasion the truth of his words was called in question by his enemies,\r\nhe stamped his foot upon the stone on which he stood, which ever after\r\nbore the ineffaceable impression as a miraculous testimony to his\r\nveracity. This story must have been an after-thought, to account for\r\nwhat we may suppose to have been a prehistoric Tanist stone.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland footmarks are very numerous, and are attributed by the\r\npeasantry to different saints. Mr. and Mrs. S.C. Hall, in their\r\naccount of Ireland, refer to several curious examples which are\r\nregarded by the people with superstitious reverence, and are the\r\noccasions of religious pilgrimage. Near the chapel of Glenfinlough, in\r\nKing's County, there is a ridge with a boulder on it called the\r\nFairy's Stone or the Horseman's Stone, which presents on its flat\r\nsurface, besides cup-like hollows, crosses, and other markings,\r\nrudely-carved representations of the human foot. On a stone near\r\nParsonstown, called Fin's Seat, there are similar impressions--also\r\nassociated with crosses and cup-shaped hollows which are traditionally\r\nsaid to be the marks of Fin Mac Coul's thumb and fingers. On an\r\nexposed and smooth surface of rock on the northern slope of the Clare\r\nHills, in the townland of Dromandoora, there is the engraved\r\nimpression of a foot clothed with a sandal; and near it is sculptured\r\non the rock a figure resembling the caduceus of Mercury, while there\r\nare two cromlechs in the immediate vicinity. The inauguration-stone of\r\nthe Macmahons still exists on the hill of Lech--formerly called\r\nMullach Leaght, or \"hill of the stone\"--three miles south of Meaghan;\r\nbut the impression of the foot was unfortunately effaced by the owner\r\nof the farm about the year 1809. In the garden of Belmont on the\r\nGreencastle road, about a mile from Londonderry, there is the\r\nfamous stone of St. Columba, held in great veneration as the\r\ninauguration-stone of the ancient kings of Aileach, and which St.\r\nPatrick is said to have consecrated with his blessing. On this\r\nremarkable stone, which is about seven feet square, composed of a hard\r\ngneiss, and quite undressed by the chisel, are sculptured two feet,\r\nright and left, about ten inches long each. Boullaye le Gouze mentions\r\nthat in 1644 the print of St. Fin Bar's foot might be seen on a stone\r\nin the cemetery of the Cathedral of Cork; it has long since\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nIn the Killarney region is the promontory of Coleman's Eye--so called\r\nafter a legendary person who leapt across the stream, and left his\r\nfootprints impressed in the solid rock on the other side. These\r\nimpressions are considered Druidic, and are pointed out as such to the\r\ncurious stranger by the guides. Near an old church situated on the\r\nsouthern slope of Knockpatrick, in the parish of Graney in Leinster,\r\nthere is a large flat granite rock with the impression of two feet\r\nclearly defined on its surface. Local tradition assigns these\r\nfootprints to St. Patrick, who addressed the people on this spot, and\r\nleft behind these enduring signs of his presence. Allusion is made to\r\nthem in St. Fiaca's Hymn to St. Patrick--\"He pressed his foot on the\r\nstone; its traces remain, it wears not.\" Footprints in connection with\r\nSt. Patrick are to be found in many localities in Ireland, as, for\r\ninstance, on the seashore south of Skerries, County Dublin, where the\r\napostle landed; and at Skerries, County Antrim, there are marks which\r\nare believed to be the footprints of the angel who appeared to St.\r\nPatrick. In Ossory two localities are noted as possessing St.\r\nPatrick's footprints.\r\n\r\nSo common are the curious sculptures under consideration in Norway and\r\nSweden, that they are known by the distinct name of _Fotsulor_, or\r\nFootsoles. They are marks of either naked feet, or of feet shod with\r\nprimitive sandals. On a rock at Brygdæa in Westerbotten, in Norway,\r\nthere are no less than thirty footmarks carved on a rock at an equal\r\ndistance from each other. In other parts of Norway these footprints\r\nare mixed up with rude outlines of ships, wheels, and other\r\n_hällristningar_, or rock-sculptures. Holmberg has figured many of\r\nthem in his interesting work entitled _Scandinaviens Hällristningar_.\r\nAt Lökeberg Bohnslau, Sweden, there is a group of ten pairs of\r\nfootmarks, associated with cup-shaped hollows and ship-carvings; and\r\nat Backa, in the same district, several pairs of feet, or rather\r\nshoe-marks, are engraved upon a rock. In Denmark not a few examples of\r\nartificial foot-tracks have been observed and described by Dr.\r\nPetersen. One was found on a slab belonging to the covering of a\r\ngallery in the inside of a tomb in the island of Seeland, and another\r\non one of the blocks of stone surrounding a tumulus in the island of\r\nLaaland. In both cases the soles of the feet are represented as being\r\ncovered; and in all probability they belong to the late stone or\r\nearlier bronze age. With these sepulchral marks are associated curious\r\nDanish legends, which refer them to real impressions of human feet.\r\nThe islands of Denmark were supposed to have been made by enchanters,\r\nwho wished for greater facilities for going to and fro, and dropped\r\nthem in the sea as stations or stepping-stones on their way; and\r\nhence, in a region where the popular imagination poetises the\r\ncommonest material objects, and is saturated with stories of elves and\r\ngiants, with magic swords, and treasures guarded by dragons, it was\r\nnot difficult to conclude that these mysterious foot-sculptures were\r\nmade by the tread of supernatural beings. Near the station of Sens, in\r\nFrance, there is a curious dolmen, on one of whose upright stones or\r\nprops are carved two human feet. And farther north, in Brittany, upon\r\na block of stone in the barrow or tumulus of Petit Mont at Arzon, may\r\nbe seen carved an outline of the soles of two human feet, right and\r\nleft, with the impressions of the toes very distinctly cut, like the\r\nmarks left by a person walking on the soft sandy shore of the sea.\r\nThey are surrounded by a number of waving circular and serpentine\r\nlines exceedingly curious. On Calais pier may be seen a footprint\r\nwhere Louis XVIII. landed in 1814; and on the rocks of Magdesprung, a\r\nvillage in the Hartz Mountains, a couple of hundred feet apart, are\r\ntwo immense footprints, which tradition ascribes to a leap made by a\r\nhuge giantess from the clouds for the purpose of rescuing one of her\r\nmaidens from the violence of an ancient baron.\r\n\r\nIn not a few places in our own country and on the Continent, rough\r\nmisshapen marks on rocks and stones, bearing a fanciful resemblance to\r\nthe outline of the human foot, have been supposed by popular\r\nsuperstition to have been made by Satan. Every classical student is\r\nfamiliar with the account which Herodotus gives of the print of\r\nHercules shown by the Scythians in his day upon a rock near the river\r\nTyras, the modern Dnieper. It was said to resemble the footstep of a\r\nman, only that it was two cubits long. He will also recall the\r\ndescription given by the same gossipy writer of the Temple of Perseus\r\nin the Thebaic district of Egypt, in which a sandal worn by the god,\r\ntwo cubits in length, occasionally made its appearance as a token of\r\nthe visit of Perseus to the earth, and a sign of prosperity to the\r\nland. Pythagoras measured similar footprints at Olympia, and\r\ncalculated \"ex pede Herculem\"! Still more famous was the mark on the\r\nvolcanic rock on the shore of Lake Regillus--the scene of the\r\nmemorable battle in which the Romans, under the dictator Posthumius,\r\ndefeated the powerful confederation of the Latin tribes under the\r\nTarquins. According to tradition, the Roman forces were assisted by\r\nCastor and Pollux, who helped them to achieve their signal victory.\r\nThe mark was supposed to have been left by the horse of one of the\r\ngreat twins \"who fought so well for Rome,\" as Macaulay says in his\r\nspirited ballad. On the way to the famous convent of Monte Casino,\r\nvery near the door, there is a cross in the middle of the road. In\r\nfront of it a grating covers the mark of a knee, which is said to have\r\nbeen left in the rock by St. Benedict, when he knelt there to ask a\r\nblessing from heaven before laying the foundation-stone of his\r\nconvent. As the site of the monastery was previously occupied by a\r\ntemple of Apollo, and a grove sacred to Venus, where the inhabitants\r\nof the surrounding locality worshipped as late as the sixth\r\ncentury,--to which circumstance Dante alludes,--it is probable that\r\nthe sacred mark on the rock may have belonged to the old pagan\r\nidolatry, and have been a cup-marked stone connected with sacrificial\r\nlibations.\r\n\r\nOn many rocks of the United States of America may be seen human\r\nfootprints, either isolated or connected with other designs belonging\r\nto the pictorial system of the Aborigines, and commemorating incidents\r\nwhich they thought worthy of being preserved. In the collection of the\r\nSmithsonian Museum are three large stone slabs having impressions of\r\nthe human foot. On two slabs of sandstone, carefully cut from rocks on\r\nthe banks of the Missouri, may be seen respectively two impressions of\r\nfeet, carved apparently with moccasins, such as are worn at the\r\npresent day by the Sioux and other Indians. The other specimen is a\r\nflat boulder of white quartz, obtained in Gasconade County, Missouri,\r\nwhich bears on one of its sides the mark of a naked foot, each toe\r\nbeing distinctly scooped out and indicated. The footmark is surrounded\r\nby a number of cup-shaped depressions. In many parts of Dacotah, where\r\nthe route is difficult to find, rocks occur with human footprints\r\ncarved upon them which were probably meant to serve as geographical\r\nlandmarks--as they invariably indicate the best route to some Indian\r\nencampment or to the shallow parts of some deep river. Among other\r\nplaces these footprints have been met with on the Blue Mountains\r\nbetween Georgia and North Carolina, and also on the Kenawha River.\r\nSome stir was made two years ago by the reported discovery of the\r\nprints of human feet in a stone quarry on the coast of Lake Managua in\r\nNicaragua. The footprints are remarkably sharp and distinct; one seems\r\nthat of a little child. The stone in which they are impressed is a\r\nspongy volcanic tuff, and the layer superimposed upon them in the\r\nquarry was of similar material. These prehistoric footprints were\r\ndoubtless accidentally impressed upon the volcanic stone, and would\r\nseem to throw back the age of man on the earth to a most remote\r\nantiquity. In Equatorial Africa footprints have also been found, and\r\nare associated with the folklore of the country. Stanley, in his _Dark\r\nContinent_, tells us that in the legendary history of Uganda, Kimera,\r\nthe third in descent from Ham, was so large and heavy that he made\r\nmarks in the rocks wherever he trod. The impression of one of his feet\r\nis shown at Uganda on a rock near the capital, Ulagolla. It was made\r\nby one of his feet slipping while he was in the act of hurling his\r\nspear at an elephant. In the South Sea Islands department of the\r\nBritish Museum is an impression of a gigantic footstep five feet in\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nThe connection of prehistoric footprints with sacred sites and places\r\nof sepulture would indicate that they had a religious significance--an\r\nidea still further strengthened by the fact of their being frequently\r\nassociated with holy wells and groves, and with cup-shaped marks on\r\ncromlechs or sacrificial altars, which are supposed to have been used\r\nfor the purpose of receiving libations; while their universal\r\ndistribution points to a hoary antiquity, when a primitive natural\r\ncultus spread over the whole earth, traces of which are found in every\r\nland, behind the more elaborate and systematic faith which afterwards\r\ntook its place. They are probably among the oldest stone-carvings that\r\nhave been left to us, and were executed by rude races with rude\r\nimplements either in the later stone or early bronze age. Their\r\nsubsequent dedication to holy persons in Christian times was in all\r\nlikelihood only a survival of their original sacred use long ages\r\nafter the memory of the particular rites and ceremonies connected with\r\nthem passed away. A considerable proportion of the sacred marks are\r\nsaid to be impressions of the female foot, attributed to the Virgin\r\nMary; and in this circumstance we may perhaps trace a connection with\r\nthe worship of the receptive element in nature, which was also a\r\ndistinctive feature of primitive religion.\r\n\r\nIt is strange how traces of this primitive worship of footprints\r\nsurvive, not merely in the mythical stories and superstitious\r\npractices connected with the objects themselves, but also in curious\r\nrites and customs that at first sight might seem to have had no\r\nconnection with them. The throwing of the shoe after a newly-married\r\ncouple is said to refer to the primitive mode of marriage by capture;\r\nbut there is equal plausibility in referring it to the prehistoric\r\nworship of the footprint as a symbol of the powers of nature. To the\r\nsame original source we may perhaps attribute the custom connected\r\nwith the Levirate law in the Bible, when the woman took off the shoe\r\nof the kinsman who refused to marry her, whose name should be\r\nafterwards called in Israel \"the house of him that hath his shoe\r\nloosed.\"\r\n\r\nIn regard to the general subject, it may be said that we can discern\r\nin the primitive adoration of footprints a somewhat advanced stage in\r\nthe religious thoughts of man. He has got beyond total unconsciousness\r\nof God, and beyond totemism or the mere worship of natural\r\nobjects--trees, streams, stones, animals, etc. He has reached the\r\nconception of a deity who is of a different nature from the objects\r\naround him, and whose place of abode is elsewhere. He worships the\r\nimpression of the foot for the sake of the being who left it; and the\r\nimpression helps him to realise the presence and to form a picture of\r\nhis deity. That deity is not a part of nature, because he can make\r\nnature plastic to his tread, and leave his footmark on the hard rock\r\nas if it were soft mud. He thinks of him as the author and controller\r\nof nature, and for the first time rises to the conception of a\r\nsupernatural being.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE ROMAN FORUM\r\n\r\n\r\nNo spot on earth has a grander name or a more imposing history than\r\nthe Roman Forum. Its origin takes us far back to geological ages--to a\r\nperiod modern indeed in the inarticulate annals of the earth, but\r\ncompared with which even those great periods which mark the rise and\r\nfall of empires are but as the running of the sands in an hour-glass.\r\nIt opens up a wonderful chapter in the earth's stony book. Everywhere\r\non the site and in the neighbourhood of Rome striking indications of\r\nancient volcanoes abound. The whole region is as certainly of igneous\r\norigin, and was the centre of as violent fiery action, as the vicinity\r\nof Naples. The volcanic energy of Italy seems to have begun first in\r\nthis district, and when exhausted there, to have passed gradually to\r\nthe south, where Vesuvius, Etna, and Stromboli witness to the great\r\nfurnace that is still burning fiercely under the beautiful land. No\r\nspectacle could have been more sublime than that which the Roman\r\nCampagna presented at this period, when no less than ten volcanoes\r\nwere in full or intermittent action, and poured their clouds of smoke\r\nand flame into the lurid sky all around the horizon. Up to the foot of\r\nthe mountains the sea covered the vast plain; and the action of these\r\nwaves of fire and steaming floods forms a natural epic of the grandest\r\norder. Prodigious quantities of ashes and cinders were discharged from\r\nthe craters; and these, deposited and hardened by long pressure under\r\nwater, formed the reddish-brown earthy rock called tufa, of which the\r\nseven hills of Rome are composed.\r\n\r\nWhen the sea retired, or rather when the land rose suddenly or\r\ngradually, and the volcanoes became extinct, the streams which\r\ndescended from the mountains and watered the recovered land spread\r\nthemselves out in numerous fresh-water lakes, which stood an hundred\r\nand fifty feet higher than the present bed of the Tiber. In these\r\nlakes were formed two kinds of fresh-water strata--the first composed\r\nof sand and marl; and the second, where mineral springs gushed forth\r\nthrough the volcanic rock, of travertine--a peculiar reddish-brown or\r\nyellow calcareous rock, of which St. Peter's and many of the buildings\r\nof modern Rome are composed. We find lacustrine marls on the sides of\r\nthe Esquiline Hill where it slopes down into the Forum, and\r\nfresh-water bivalve and univalve shells in the ground under the\r\nequestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius on the Capitol; while on the face\r\nof the Aventine Hill, overhanging the Tiber at a height of ninety\r\nfeet, is a cliff of travertine, which is half a mile long. The lakes\r\nwhich formed these deposits must have covered their sites for many\r\nages. At last, by some new change of level, the lakes retired, and the\r\nTiber scooped out for itself its present channel to the sea.\r\n\r\nWhen man came upon the scene we have no definite information; but\r\nnumerous flints and stone-weapons have been found among the black\r\npumice breccias of the Campagna mixed with remains of the primitive\r\nbison, the elephant, and the rhinoceros. Human eyes must therefore\r\nhave gazed upon the volcanoes of the Roman plain. Human beings,\r\noccupying the outposts of the Sabine Hills, must have seen that plain\r\nbroken up by the sea into a complicated archipelago, and beheld in the\r\nvery act of formation that wonderful region destined long ages\r\nafterwards to be the scene of some of the greatest events in human\r\nhistory. The Alban Hills, whose present quiet beauty, adorned with\r\nwhite gem-like towns, and softened with the purple hues of heaven,\r\nstrikes every visitor with admiration, were active volcanoes pouring\r\nstreams of lava down into the plain even after the foundation of the\r\nEternal City. Livy mentions that under the third king of Rome, a\r\nshower of stones, accompanied by a loud noise, was thrown up from the\r\nAlban Mount--a prodigy which gave rise to a nine days' festival\r\nannually celebrated long after by the people of Latium. The remarkable\r\nfunereal urns found buried under a bed of volcanic matter between\r\nMarino and Castel Gandolfo on the Alban Hills are an incontrovertible\r\nproof that showers of volcanic ashes must have been ejected from the\r\nneighbouring volcano when the country was inhabited by human beings;\r\nnay, when the inhabitants were far advanced in civilisation, for among\r\nthe objects contained in the funereal urns were implements of writing.\r\nAt the close of the skirmish between the Romans and Etruscans, near\r\nAlbano, in which Aruns, the son of Lars Porsenna, was slain, whose\r\ntomb may still be seen on the spot, a noise like that which Livy\r\nmentions was heard among the surrounding hills.\r\n\r\nBut the most extraordinary of all the volcanic phenomena within the\r\nhistorical period was the sudden rising on two memorable occasions of\r\nthe waters of the Alban Lake, which now lie deep down within the basin\r\nof an extinct crater. The first swallowed up the royal palace of Alba,\r\nand was so sudden and violent that neither the king nor any of his\r\nhousehold had time to escape. The other occurred during the romantic\r\nsiege of the Etruscan city of Veii, near Rome, by Camillus, four\r\nhundred years before Christ. The waters on that occasion rose two\r\nhundred and forty feet in the crater almost to the very edge, and\r\nthreatened to overflow and inundate the surrounding country, when they\r\nwere withdrawn by a subterranean canal cut in the rock, and poured\r\ninto the Tiber by a connecting stream. This emissary, which may still\r\nbe seen, was constructed owing to a hint given by an Etruscan\r\nsoothsayer, that the city of Veii would not be captured till the\r\nAlban Lake was emptied into the sea. The deep winding cavern on the\r\nface of the Aventine Hill, said to have been inhabited by the\r\nmonstrous giant Cacus, the son of Vulcan, who vomited fire, and was\r\nthe terror of the surrounding inhabitants, was evidently of volcanic\r\norigin; and the local tradition from which Virgil concocted his fable\r\nwas undoubtedly derived from a vivid recollection of the active\r\noperations of a volcano. When Evander, as described in the eighth\r\n_Æneid_, conducted his distinguished guest to the top of the Tarpeian\r\nRock, in after ages so famous as the place of public execution, and\r\ncomposed of very hard lava, he assured him that an awful terror\r\npossessed the place, and that some unknown god had his abode there.\r\nThe shepherds said it was Jupiter, and that they had often seen him\r\nkindling his lightnings and hurling his thunderbolts from thence.\r\nEvander then pointed to the ruined cities of Saturnia and Janiculum,\r\non either side of the Tiber, whose destruction had been caused by the\r\nwrath of the god. There can be no doubt that this fable clothed with\r\nsupernatural colouring some volcanic phenomena which had taken place\r\non this spot during the human period. Even as late as three hundred\r\nand ninety years after the foundation of Rome, a chasm opened in the\r\nForum, and emitted flames and pestilential vapours. An oracle declared\r\nthat this chasm would not close until what constituted the glory of\r\nRome should be cast into it. Marcus Curtius asked if anything in Rome\r\nwas more precious than arms and valour; and arraying himself in his\r\narmour, and mounting on a horse splendidly equipped, he leapt in the\r\npresence of the Roman people into the abyss, when it instantly closed\r\nfor ever. We thus see that the geology of the Roman plain throws no\r\ninconsiderable light upon the early history and traditions of the\r\nEternal City, and brings within the cycle of natural phenomena what\r\nwere long supposed to be purely fabulous incidents, the inventions of\r\na poetic imagination. I have dwelt upon these geological incidents so\r\nfully, because nowhere does one realise the striking contrast between\r\nthe shortness of man's existence on earth, as in places like the Roman\r\nplain, where the traces of cosmical energy have been greatest and most\r\nenduring.\r\n\r\nThe volcanic origin of the Roman Forum suggests the curious idea of\r\nthe intimate connection of some of the greatest events of history with\r\nvolcanic centres. Where the strife of nature has been fiercest, there\r\nby a strange coincidence the storm of human passion has been greatest.\r\nThe geological history of a region is most frequently typical of its\r\nhuman history. We can predicate of a scene where the cosmical\r\ndisturbance has been great,--where fire and flood have contended for\r\nthe mastery, leaving the effects of their strife in deepening valleys\r\nand ascending hills,--that there man has had a strangely varied and\r\neventful career. The strongholds and citadels of the earth, where the\r\ngreat battles of freedom and civilisation have been fought, were all\r\nuntold ages previously the centres of violent plutonic disturbances.\r\nEdinburgh Castle, enthroned on its trap-rock, once the centre of a\r\nvolcano, is associated with the most stirring and important events in\r\nthe history of Scotland; Stirling Castle rises on its trap-rock\r\nerupted by volcanic action above a vast plain, across which a hundred\r\nbattles have swept; Dumbarton Castle, crowning its trappean\r\npromontory, has represented in its civil history the protracted\r\nperiods of earthquake and eruption concerned in the formation of its\r\nsite; while standing in solitude amid the stormy waters of the Firth\r\nof Forth, the Bass Rock, once a scene of fiery confusion, of roaring\r\nwaves and heaving earthquakes, has formed alternately the prison where\r\nreligious liberty has been strangled, and the fortress where\r\npatriotism has taken its last stand against the forces of the invader.\r\nPalestine, Greece, Italy, Switzerland, and Scotland, the countries\r\nthat have had the most remarkable history, and have done most to\r\nadvance the human race, are distinguished above other countries for\r\ntheir geological convulsions and revolutions. The Roman Forum is thus\r\nbut one specimen among numerous others of a law of Providence which\r\nhas associated the strife of nature with the strife of man, and caused\r\nthe ravages of the most terrible elements to prepare the way for the\r\nhighest development of the human race.\r\n\r\nBetween the Roman Forum and the valley beneath Edinburgh Castle we can\r\ntrace a striking resemblance, not only in their volcanic origin and\r\nthe connection between their geological history and their analogous\r\ncivil history, but also in the fact that they were both filled with\r\nsmall lakes. Between the ridges of the old and new town of Edinburgh,\r\nwhere the railway runs through Princes Street Gardens, there was in\r\nthe memory of many now living a considerable collection of water\r\ncalled the North Loch. In like manner, in the hollow of the Roman\r\nForum there was originally a small lake, a relic of the numerous lakes\r\nof the Campagna, which remained after the last elevation of the land,\r\nand which existed pretty far on into the human period. It was fed by\r\nthree streams flowing from the Palatine, the Capitoline, and the\r\nEsquiline Hills, which now run underground and meet at this point.\r\n\r\nLet us picture to ourselves the appearance of this lake embosomed in\r\nthe hollow of its hills in the far-off pastoral times, when the\r\nmountains and the high table-lands of Italy were the chosen territory\r\nof those tribes whose property consisted chiefly in their flocks. The\r\nhills of Rome, whose elevation was far more conspicuous in ancient\r\ntimes than it is now, presented a precipitous front of dark volcanic\r\nrock to the lake. Their slopes were covered with grass and with\r\nnatural copse-wood, intermixed with tall ilex trees, or umbrella\r\npines; while on their summits were little villages surrounded with\r\nCyclopean walls perched there not only for security, but also for the\r\nhealthier air, just as we see at the present day all over Italy. On\r\nthe summit of the Capitoline and Esquiline Hills were Sabine\r\nsettlements, whose origin is lost in the mists of antiquity. To the\r\ngreen wooded slopes of the Palatine, according to a beautiful\r\ntradition, sixty years before the destruction of Troy, came Evander\r\nand his Arcadians from Greece, and settled there with their flocks and\r\nherds, and led a quiet idyllic life. According to another tradition,\r\nÆneas, after the destruction of Troy, came to this spot, and marrying\r\nthe daughter of a neighbouring king, became the ancestor of the twins\r\nRomulus and Remus, the popular founders of Rome, whose romantic\r\nexposure and nourishment by a she-wolf are known to every schoolboy.\r\nRomulus, after slaying his brother, built a stronghold on the\r\nPalatine, which he opened as an asylum for outlaws and runaway slaves,\r\nwho supported themselves chiefly by plunder. The community of this\r\nrobber-city consisting almost entirely of males, they provided\r\nthemselves with wives by the famous stratagem known as the \"Rape of\r\nthe Sabine women.\" Seizing the daughters of their neighbours, the\r\nSabines of the Capitoline and Esquiline Hills, on a festive occasion,\r\nthey carried them away with them to their fortress. A number of\r\nsanguinary fights took place in consequence of this rape around the\r\nswampy margin of the lake. In the last of these engagements the\r\ncombatants were separated by the Sabine women suddenly rushing in with\r\ntheir children between their fathers and brothers and the men who had\r\nbecome their husbands. A mutual reconciliation then ensued, and the\r\ntwo communities contracted a firm and close alliance. The Palatine,\r\nCapitoline, and Esquiline villages became henceforth one city, to\r\nwhich from time to time by conquest new accessions were made, until at\r\nlast all the different settlements on the seven hills of Rome were\r\nbrought under one rule, and surrounded by a common wall of defence.\r\nMommsen, Niebuhr, Sir George Cornewall Lewis, and other critics, have\r\nmade sad havoc with these romantic stories of the origin of Rome. But\r\nalthough much of the fabulous undoubtedly mingles with them--for the\r\nearly history of Rome was not written till it had become a powerful\r\nstate, and then the historian had no records of days long past save\r\nwhat were embodied in popular tradition and poetry--there has recently\r\nbeen a reaction in favour of them, and they must ever be interesting\r\non account of their own intrinsic charm, the element of truth which\r\nthey contain, and the indelible associations of schoolboy life.\r\n\r\nWhen a joint city was thus compacted and called Rome--possibly its old\r\nPelasgic appellation--the first effort of the confederated settlements\r\nwas to drain the geological lake in the centre of the city into the\r\nTiber, a quarter of a mile distant. This they did by means of the\r\ncelebrated Cloaca Maxima, a part of which may be seen open at the\r\npresent day under the pavement of the Roman Forum, near the Temple of\r\nCastor and Pollux. This common sewer of Rome is one of its oldest and\r\ngreatest relics. It was built by the first Tarquin, the fifth king of\r\nRome, a century and a half after the foundation of the city; and\r\nalthough two thousand five hundred years have passed away since the\r\narchitect formed without cement its massive archway of huge volcanic\r\nstones found on the spot, and during all the time it has been\r\nsubjected to the shock of numerous earthquakes, inundations of the\r\nTiber, and the crash of falling ruins, it still serves its original\r\npurpose as effectually as ever, and promises to stand for as many ages\r\nin the future as it has stood in the past. It is commonly said that we\r\nowe the invention of the arch to the Romans; and this work of\r\nundoubted Etruscan architecture is usually considered as among the\r\nvery first applications of the principle. But the arched drains and\r\ndoorways discovered by Layard at Nineveh prove that the Assyrians\r\nemployed the arch centuries before Rome was founded. It had however\r\nonly a subordinate place and a very limited application in the ancient\r\narchitecture of the East; and it was left to the Romans to give it due\r\nprominence in crossing wide spaces, to make it \"the bow of promise,\"\r\nthe bridge over which they passed to the dominion of the world. The\r\nCloaca Maxima is a tunnel roofed with two concentric rings of enormous\r\nstones, the innermost having an interior diameter of nearly fourteen\r\nfeet, the height being about twelve feet. So capacious was it that\r\nStrabo mentions that a waggon loaded with hay might find room in it;\r\nand it is recorded that the Consul Agrippa passed through it in a\r\nboat. The mouth of the Cloaca opens into the Tiber, near the little\r\nround temple of Hercules in the Forum Boarium; but it is often\r\ninvisible owing to the flooding of the river; and even when the Tiber\r\nis low, so much has its bed been silted up that only about three feet\r\nbelow the keystone of the sewer can be seen. Subsequently all the\r\nsewers of Rome were connected with it; and at the present day the nose\r\ngives infallible proof that it carries off a very large portion of the\r\npollution of the modern city.\r\n\r\nBy the Cloaca Maxima, the valley between the Capitoline and Palatine\r\nHills was for the first time made dry land; all indeed, except a small\r\nswamp which remained in one corner of it to a later age, and which the\r\ngreat sewer was not deep enough to drain entirely. Reeds grew around\r\nits margin, and boats were employed to cross it, as Ovid tells us. The\r\nname Velabrum--from an Etruscan root, signifying water, occurring in\r\nsome other Italian names such as Velletri, Velino--still given to this\r\nlocality, where a church stood in the middle ages called S. Silvestro\r\nin Lacu, commemorates the existence of the primeval lake; while the\r\nlegend of the casting ashore of Romulus and Remus on the slope of the\r\nPalatine points to the gradual desiccation of the spot. On the level\r\nground, recovered in this way from the waters, was formed the Roman\r\nForum; the word Forum meaning simply an open space, surrounded by\r\nbuildings and porticoes, which served the purpose of a market-place, a\r\ncourt of justice, or an exchange; for the Romans transacted more of\r\ntheir public and private business out of doors than the severe\r\nclimate of our northern latitudes will permit us to do. On this common\r\nground representatives of the separate communities located on the\r\ndifferent hills of Rome, and comprehended and confederated within the\r\nwalls of Servius Tullius, met together for the settlement of affairs\r\nthat concerned them all. As Rome grew in importance, so did this\r\ncentral representative part of it grow with it, until at last, in the\r\ntime of the Cæsars, it became the heart of the mighty empire, where\r\nits pulse beat loudest. There the fate of the world was discussed.\r\nThere Cicero spoke, and Cæsar ruled, and Horace meditated. If the\r\nTemple of Jerusalem was the shrine of religion, the Forum of Rome was\r\nthe shrine of law; and from thence has emanated that unrivalled system\r\nof jurisprudence which has formed the model of every nation since.\r\nBeing thus the centre of the political power of the empire, the Roman\r\nForum became also the focus of its architectural and civic splendour.\r\nIt was crowded with marble temples, state buildings, and courts of law\r\nto such an extent that we wonder how there was room for them all\r\nwithin such a narrow area. Monuments of great men, statues of Greek\r\nsculpture, colonnades, and porticoes, rich with the spoils of subject\r\nkingdoms, adorned its sides. The whole region was resplendent with all\r\nthe pomp and luxury of paganism in its proudest hour; the word\r\n\"ambition,\" which came ultimately to signify all strivings for\r\neminence, resolving itself into the elementary meaning of a walk round\r\nthe Roman Forum, canvassing for votes at municipal elections.\r\n\r\nThus the Forum continued until the decay of the empire, when hordes of\r\ninvaders buried its magnificence in ruins. At the beginning of the\r\nseventh century it must have been open and comparatively free from\r\n_débris_, as is proved by the fact that the column of Phocas, erected,\r\nat that time, stood on the original pavement. Virgil says, in his\r\naccount of the romantic interview of Evander with Æneas on the spot\r\nwhich was to be afterwards Rome--then a quiet pastoral scene, green\r\nwith grass, and covered with bushes--that they saw herds of cattle\r\nwandering over the Forum, and browsing on the rich pasture around the\r\nshores of its blue lake. Strange, the law of circularity, after the\r\nlapse of two thousand years, brought round the same state of things in\r\nthat storied spot. During the middle ages the Roman Forum was known\r\nonly as the Campo Vaccino, the field of cattle. It was a forlorn\r\nwaste, with a few ruins scattered over it, and two formal rows of\r\npoplar-trees running down the middle of it, and wild-eyed buffaloes\r\nand mouse-coloured oxen from the Campagna wandering over the solitude,\r\nand cropping the grass and green weeds that grew in the very heart of\r\nold Rome. When Gibbon conceived the idea of the _Decline and Fall of\r\nthe Roman Empire_, listening to the vespers of the Franciscan friars\r\nin the dim church of Ara Coeli in the neighbourhood, the Forum was an\r\nunsightly piece of ground, covered with rubbish-heaps, with only a\r\npillar or two emerging from the general filth. When Byron stood beside\r\nthe \"nameless column with the buried base,\" commemorated in _Childe\r\nHarold_, he little dreamt what a rich collection of the relics of\r\nimperial times lay under his feet, as completely buried by the wrecks\r\nof ages as Pompeii and Herculaneum under the ashes and lava of\r\nVesuvius. From fifteen to twenty feet of soil had accumulated over\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe work of excavation was begun seventy-five years ago by the Duchess\r\nof Devonshire, who spent the last years of her life in Rome, and\r\nformed the centre of its brilliant society. Napoleon III., the late\r\nEmperor of the French, carried on the task thus auspiciously\r\ncommenced, for the purpose of shedding light upon the parts of Roman\r\nhistory connected with Julius Cæsar, the hero of his book. In spite of\r\nmuch opposition from the Papal Government, the work of exhumation was\r\ncontinued in fits and starts after the French emperor had given it up;\r\nand ever since the Italian Government have taken the matter in hand,\r\ngangs of labourers under the directorship of the accomplished Signor\r\nRosa have been more or less continually employed, with the result that\r\nalmost the whole area has been laid bare from the Capitol to the Arch\r\nof Titus. The British Archæological Society of Rome has given valuable\r\naid according to the funds in its possession, and the contributions\r\nsent from this country for the purpose. When first commenced, the\r\nchanges caused by these excavations were regarded with no favourable\r\neye by either the artists or the people of Rome. The trees were cut\r\ndown, the mantle of verdure that for centuries had covered the\r\nspot--Nature's appropriate pall for the decay of art--was ruthlessly\r\ntorn up, and great unsightly holes and heaps of _débris_ utterly\r\ndestroyed the picturesque beauty of the scene. But the loss to romance\r\nwas a gain to knowledge; and now that the greatest part of the Forum\r\nhas been cleared down to the ancient pavement, we are able to form a\r\nmuch more vivid and accurate conception of what the place must have\r\nbeen in the days of the empire, and are in a position to identify\r\nbuildings which previously had been a theme for endless and violent\r\ndisputes. It is a very interesting and suggestive coincidence that the\r\nForum of Rome should have been thus disentombed at the very time that\r\nItaly rose from its grave of ages, and under a free and enlightened\r\ngovernment, having its centre once more in the Eternal City, proved\r\nthat it had inherited no small share of the spirit of the heroic past.\r\n\r\nLet us go over in brief detail the various objects of interest that\r\nmay now be seen in the centre of Roman greatness. Numerous sources of\r\ninformation exist which enable us to identify these monuments, and to\r\nform some idea of what they were in their prime. Among these may be\r\nmentioned coins and medals of the emperors, with representations upon\r\nthem of buildings and sculptures in the Forum; a marble stone found at\r\nAncyra, now Angouri in Phrygia, on which is a long inscription\r\nregarding the acts and achievements of Augustus, which is of the\r\ngreatest value in determining the topography of the city; the\r\nbas-reliefs on the Arch of Constantine, and on the marble screens of\r\nTrajan, recently excavated in the Forum itself, giving a view of its\r\nnorth-western and south-eastern ends; and the remains of the antique\r\nmarble plan of Rome, now preserved in the Capitoline Museum,\r\noriginally affixed to the wall of the superb Temple of Rome, and\r\ndiscovered in fragments in 1867 in the garden of the monastery of SS.\r\nCosma e Damiano. We also get most valuable help in the work of\r\nidentification from the Itineraries of the middle ages--especially\r\nfrom that of the celebrated pilgrim from Einsiedlen, Zwingli's town in\r\nSwitzerland--who visited Rome in the eighth century, and left his\r\nmanuscript to his own abbey, where it may still be seen. A vast\r\napparatus of learning has been accumulated from the works of ancient\r\nclassic authors by the great scholars who have written on the\r\nhistorical localities and buildings of the Forum, from Donati to\r\nBecker. Nibby, Canina, Ampère, Bunsen, Plattner, and Uhrlich, in their\r\nmagnificent works have supplied a mine of wealth from which most\r\nsubsequent writers on the Forum have enriched their descriptions.\r\n\r\nThe direction of the Forum is nearly from north to south, trending a\r\nlittle from north-east to south-west. It is surprisingly small to have\r\ncontained such a large number of buildings, and to have bulked so\r\nprominently in the eye of the world; its greatest length being only\r\nsix hundred and seventy-one feet, and its greatest breadth about two\r\nhundred and two feet. Beginning at the north end, we see before us the\r\nvast mass of the ancient Capitol, the proudest symbol of the majesty\r\nof Rome, crowned with the great staring medieval structures of the\r\nRoman municipality, rising up into the campanile of Michael Angelo.\r\nUntil of late years, this renowned building was completely buried\r\nbeneath a huge mound of rubbish. Now that it has been removed, the\r\nvenerable fabric stands out distinctly to view, and we behold the\r\nmassive walls of the Treasury, the Record Office, and the Senate\r\nHouse. The lowest part, constructed of huge blocks of volcanic stones,\r\nwas the Ærarium or Public Treasury, and is supposed to have been\r\nformed out of the original wall of the city of the Sabines, which\r\nsurrounded the hill of Saturn, as the Capitoline Mount was originally\r\ncalled, long before Romulus laid the foundation of Rome. As the Roman\r\narmy was paid in coppers, spacious cellars were required for storing\r\nthe coin, and these were provided in the underground vaults of the\r\nTreasury, partially cut out of the volcanic rock of the Capitol, on\r\nwhich the building rests. Above the Treasury, on the second floor, we\r\nsee the remains of the Doric portico of the Tabularium or Public\r\nRecord Office, where the records of Rome, engraved upon bronze\r\ntablets, were kept. The place is now converted into an architectural\r\nmuseum, where all the most interesting sculptured fragments found in\r\nthe Forum are preserved, and are exhibited by gaslight owing to the\r\ndarkness. These buildings, it must be remembered, form the back of the\r\nCapitol fronting the Forum. Strictly speaking, they do not belong to\r\nthe Forum, which should be traced only from their verge.\r\n\r\nThe view on the other side of the Capitol, where a gently-inclined\r\nstaircase leads up from the streets to the piazza at the top,\r\nsurrounded by the modern municipal buildings, raised upon the ancient\r\nsubstructures above described, is quite different. But the present\r\naspect of the Capitol is quite disappointing to one who comes to it\r\nseeking for evidences of its former grandeur. There is no trace of the\r\nTemple of Jupiter Capitolinus, to which the triumphal processions of\r\nthe Roman armies led up, gorgeous with all the attractions of marble\r\narchitecture, and the richest spoils of the world, the most splendid\r\nmonument of human pride which the world then contained. Probably its\r\nremains were used up in the construction of the gloomy old church of\r\nthe _Ara Coeli_, which is supposed by most archæologists to stand upon\r\nits site. The Capitol, it may be remarked, was precisely similar to\r\nthe moot-hill, or open-air court, which existed in our own country in\r\nprimitive times, and where justice was administered at regular\r\nintervals. The tradition of this original use of it still clings to\r\nthe place as a shadow from the past. The hill has always been\r\nappropriated for political purposes. It has continued from the\r\nearliest days to be a centre of secular as opposed to ecclesiastical\r\nauthority. The Popes ceded it to the magistracy, whose municipal\r\nbuildings now cover it, and placed the church of Ara Coeli--the only\r\none ever built on the Capitoline Hill--under their protection. The\r\nplace of execution was chosen conveniently near to this moot-hill, or\r\nseat of justice; and the criminal, when condemned, was speedily\r\nexecuted, by being hurled over the rock, just outside of the eastern\r\nrampart, which surrounded the settlement. We can thus easily\r\nunderstand the association of the Tarpeian Rock with the Capitoline\r\nHill. They were as closely correlated as the moot-hill and the Gallow\r\nhill in our own country. The primitive method of execution derived a\r\nsanctity from its antiquity, and was continued far on into the most\r\ncivilised times of the empire.\r\n\r\nSo densely crowded were the historical buildings and remarkable sites\r\nin that part of the Forum which lay immediately behind the Capitol,\r\nthat it is almost impossible now to identify their position or\r\nremains. This spot forms the great battle-ground of the antiquaries,\r\nwhose conclusions in many instances are mere guess-work. Below the\r\nmedieval tower of the Capitol is a wide space paved with fragments of\r\ncoloured marbles, and with indications of the ground-plan of a\r\nbuilding. This is supposed to mark the site of the Temple of Concord,\r\nerected by the great general Camillus, after the expulsion of the\r\nGauls, to perpetuate the concord between the plebeians and patricians\r\non the vexed question of the election of consuls. It was placed beside\r\nthe old meeting-place of the privileged families. From the charred\r\nstate of some of its sculptures discovered on the spot, it is\r\nsupposed to have been destroyed by fire. It was restored and enlarged\r\na hundred and twenty years before Christ by the Consul Opimius\r\nimmediately after the murder of Caius Gracchus. To the classical\r\nstudent it is specially interesting as the place where Cicero convoked\r\nthe senate after the discovery of the Catiline conspiracy, for the\r\npurpose of fixing the punishment due to one of the greatest of crimes.\r\nAmong the senators present on that memorable occasion were men of the\r\nhighest political and philosophical renown, including Cæsar, Cato, and\r\nCicero. They came to the conclusion that there was no such thing as\r\nretribution beyond the grave, no future state of consciousness, no\r\nimmortality of the soul; consequently death was considered too mild a\r\npunishment for the impious treason of the conspirators; and a penalty,\r\nwhich should keep alive instead of extinguishing suffering, was\r\nadvocated. We learn from this extraordinary argument, as Merivale well\r\nsays, how utter was the religious scepticism among the brightest\r\nintellects of Rome only thirty-seven years before the coming of\r\nChrist. The very name of the temple itself, dedicated not to a divine\r\nbeing as in a more pious age, but to a mere political abstraction, a\r\nmere symbol of a compact effected between two discordant parties in\r\nthe state, indicated how greatly the Romans had declined from their\r\nprimitive faith.\r\n\r\nBut the most conspicuous of the ancient remains in this quarter, and\r\nthe first to attract the notice of every visitor, is the Ionic portico\r\nof eight columns, called at first the Temple of Jupiter, and then of\r\nVespasian, but now definitely determined to be the Temple of Saturn,\r\nfor it is closely connected with the Ærarium, and the Ærarium is said\r\nby several ancient authors to have led into the podium of the temple\r\nby a doorway in its wall still visible. This temple is supposed to be\r\nof very early origin, and to have marked the site of an ancient Sabine\r\naltar to the oldest of the gods of Italy long before the arrival of\r\nthe Romans. It was nearly entire so late as the fifteenth century;\r\nbut its cella was ruthlessly destroyed shortly afterwards, and its\r\nmarble ornaments used for making lime. The present group of pillars\r\nwas so clumsily restored by the French at the beginning of this\r\ncentury that they are seen to differ from each other in diameter, and\r\nthe frieze is composed of fragments that do not harmonise.\r\n\r\nBut the most remarkable monument of antiquity in this part is the\r\nmarble triumphal Arch of Septimius Severus, which stands in front of\r\nthe ruins of the Temple of Concord. It invaded the site of the\r\nrepublican Græcostasis, where foreign ambassadors waited for an\r\naudience of the senate, and occupied part of the area of the Comitium,\r\nwhose original character was thereby destroyed; for it was erected at\r\na time when men ceased to care for the venerable associations\r\nconnected with the early history of their city. One gazes upon this\r\nmonument of Roman power and pride with deep respect, for it has stood\r\nnearly seventeen centuries; and though rusty and sorely battered, and\r\nits sculptures much mutilated, it is still one of the most solid and\r\nperfect relics of imperial times. It was raised to commemorate the\r\nwars of Septimius Severus in Parthia and Arabia; and represents among\r\nits carvings the goddess Rome receiving the homage of the Eastern\r\nnations. It exhibits on its panels many scenes connected with his\r\ncampaigns, the memory of which no humane man would have liked to\r\nperpetuate. On the upper part of the Arch is a large inscription in\r\nhonour of the emperor and his two sons, Caracalla and Geta. The name\r\nof Geta, however, was afterwards erased by his brother when he had\r\nmurdered him, and other words substituted. Marks of the erasure may\r\nstill be seen perfectly distinct after all these centuries, and\r\nvividly recall the terrible associations of the incident. The dislike\r\nwhich Caracalla and Geta had for each other was so virulent that their\r\nfather took them both with him to Britain, in order that they might\r\nforget their mutual animosity while engaged in active warfare.\r\nSeptimius Severus died during this campaign at York, and his sons\r\nreturned to Rome to work out soon after the domestic tragedy of which\r\nthis Arch reminds us. On the top of the Arch there was originally a\r\nbronze group of a chariot and four horses, with the emperor and his\r\nsons driving it. But this was removed at an early date; and in the\r\nmiddle ages the summit of the Arch supported the campanile of the\r\nchurch of St. Sergius and Bacchus that was built up against its sides.\r\nA little to the left, the road passing under the Arch joins the Clivus\r\nCapitolinus which wound through the Forum, and led up to the great\r\nTemple of Jupiter on the Capitol. The pavement of this ancient road,\r\nwhich still exists, is formed of broad hexagonal slabs of lava, and is\r\nas smooth and as finely jointed at this day as when the triumphal\r\nprocessions of the victorious Roman generals used to pass over it.\r\n\r\nAt the western corner of the Arch of Severus are the scanty remains of\r\na tall conical pyramid, about fifteen feet in diameter, which is\r\nidentified as the Umbilicus Romæ, placed in the exact centre of old\r\nRome. Not far from it stood the Milliarium Aureum, or Golden\r\nMilestone, on which were inscribed all the distances of roads without\r\nthe walls. The Roman roads throughout the empire terminated at this\r\npoint. With this central milestone was connected that admirable system\r\nof roads which the Romans constructed in our distant island; and it is\r\na remarkable circumstance that the principal railway lines in England\r\nare identical with the general direction of the old Roman roads. The\r\nAntonine Way is now the Great Western Railway, and the Roman Watling\r\nStreet, which ran diagonally across the country from Chester in the\r\nnorth-west to Dover in the south-east, is now replaced by the Dover,\r\nLondon, Birmingham, Grand Junction, Chester, and Crewe Railways. The\r\nreason of this union of ancient and modern lines of communication is\r\nobvious. The Romans formed their roads for the purpose of transporting\r\ntheir armies from place to place, and at certain distances along the\r\nroads a series of military stations were established. In course of\r\ntime these stations became villages, towns, and cities such as\r\nChester, Leicester, Lancaster, Manchester. Thus, strange as it may\r\nappear, the Milliarium Aureum of the Roman Forum has had much to do\r\nwith the origin of our most ancient and important towns, and with the\r\nformation of the great lines of railway that now carry on the enormous\r\ntraffic between them.\r\n\r\nThe exposed vaults immediately behind the Arch of Severus, bounding\r\nthe Forum in this direction, are richly draped with the long, delicate\r\nfronds of the maidenhair fern. Shaded from the sun, it grows here in\r\nthe crevices of the old walls in greater luxuriance and profusion than\r\nelsewhere in the city. There is something almost pathetic in this\r\nassociation of the frailest of Nature's productions with the ruins of\r\nthe most enduring of man's works. Strength that is crumbling to dust\r\nand ashes, and tender beauty that ever clings to the skirts of time,\r\nas she steps over the sepulchres of power, have here in their\r\ncombination a deep significance. The growth of the soft fern on the\r\nmouldering old stones seems like the sad, sweet smile of Nature over a\r\ndecay with which she sympathises, but which she cannot share. The same\r\nfeeling took possession of me when, wandering over the ruins of the\r\nPalaces of the Cæsars on a sunny February afternoon, I saw above the\r\nhoary masses of stone the rose-tinted bloom of almond-trees. Out of\r\nthe gray relics of man's highest hour of pride, the leafless\r\nalmond-rod blossomed as of old in the holy place of the Hebrew\r\nTabernacle; and its miracle of colour and tenderness was like the\r\ncrimson glow that lingers at sunset upon Alpine heights, telling of a\r\nglory that had long vanished from the spot.\r\n\r\nBeneath these fern-draped vaults is the oldest prison in the world.\r\nThe celebrated Mamertine Prison takes us back to the very foundation\r\nof the city. It was regarded in the time of the Cæsars as one of the\r\nmost ancient relics of Rome, and was invested with peculiar interest\r\nbecause of its venerable associations. It consists of a series of\r\nvaults excavated out of the solid tufa rock, where it slopes down from\r\nthe Capitoline Hill into the Forum, each lined with massive blocks of\r\nred volcanic stone. For a long time these vaults have been used as\r\ncellars under a row of tall squalid-looking houses built over them\r\nbetween the Via di Marforio and the Vicolo del Ghettarello; and the\r\nsense of smell gives convincing proof that where prisoners of state\r\nused to be confined, provisions of wine, cheese, and oil have been\r\nstored. The prison has recently passed into the possession of the\r\nBritish and American Archæological Society of Rome, which pays a\r\ncertain rent to the Italian Government for its use. By this society it\r\nis illuminated and shown every Monday afternoon during the season. One\r\nof the members conducts the party through the upper and lower prisons,\r\nand explains everything of interest connected with them. Dr. Parker,\r\nwhose labours have done so much to elucidate this part of ancient\r\nRome, was the guide on the occasion of my visit; and as the party was\r\nunusually small, we had a better opportunity of seeing what was to be\r\nseen, and hearing the guide's observations.\r\n\r\nThe uppermost vault is still below the level of the surrounding soil,\r\nand the entrance to it is by the church of San Giuseppe di Falegnami,\r\nthe patron of the Roman joiners, built over it. Beneath is a\r\nsubterranean chapel, forming a sort of crypt to the upper church,\r\ncalled San Pietro in Carcere, containing a curious ancient crucifix,\r\nan object of great veneration, and hung round with blazing lamps and\r\nrusty daggers, pistols, and other deadly instruments, the votive\r\nofferings of bandits and assassins who sought at this shrine of the\r\nchief of the apostles to make their peace with heaven. Descending from\r\nthe chapel by a flight of steps we come through a modern door, opened\r\nthrough the wall for the convenience of the pilgrims who annually\r\nvisit the sacred spot in crowds, to the ancient vestibule, or grand\r\nchamber of the prison, commonly called the Prison of St. Peter from\r\nthe church tradition which asserts that the great apostle was\r\nconfined here by order of Nero before his martyrdom. The pillar to\r\nwhich he was bound is still pointed out in the cell; and Dr. Parker,\r\nlifting up its cover, showed us a well in the pavement of the floor,\r\nwhich is said to have sprung up miraculously to furnish water for the\r\nbaptism of the jailors Processus and Martinianus whom he had\r\nconverted, though, unfortunately for this tradition, the fountain is\r\ndescribed by Plutarch as existing in the time of Jugurtha's\r\nimprisonment. Indeed there is every reason to believe that this\r\nchamber was originally a well-house or a subterranean cistern for\r\ncollecting water at the foot of the Capitol, from which circumstance\r\nit derived its name of Tullianum, from _tullius_, the old Etruscan\r\nword for _spring_, and not from Servius Tullius, who was erroneously\r\nsupposed to have built it. The whole chamber in primitive times was\r\nfilled with water, and the hole in the roof was used for drawing it\r\nout. Dr. Parker gave us a little of the water in a goblet, but,\r\nnotwithstanding its sacred reputation, it tasted very much like\r\nordinary water, being very cool and fresh, with a slight medicinal\r\ntaste. He also pointed our attention to a rugged hollow in the wall of\r\nthe staircase, and told us that this was the print of St. Peter's head\r\nin the hard stone, said to have been produced as he stumbled and fell\r\nagainst it, coming down the stair a chained prisoner. It requires no\r\nsmall amount of devotional credulity to recognise the likeness or to\r\nbelieve the story.\r\n\r\nBut there is no need for having recourse to such ecclesiastical\r\nlegends in order to produce a solemn impression in this chamber. Its\r\nclassical associations are sufficient of themselves to powerfully\r\naffect the imagination. There is no reason to doubt the common belief\r\nthat this is the identical cell in which the famous Jugurtha was\r\nstarved to death. The romantic history of this African king is\r\nfamiliar to all readers of Sallust, who gives a masterly account of\r\nthe Jugurthine war. When finally defeated, after having long defied\r\nthe Roman army, his person was taken possession of by treachery and\r\ncarried in chains to Rome, where he adorned the triumphal procession\r\nof his conqueror Marius, and was finally cast into this cell,\r\nperishing there of cold and hunger. What a terrible ending to the\r\ncareer of a fierce, free soldier, who had spent his life on horseback\r\nin the boundless sultry deserts of Western Africa! The temperature of\r\nthe place is exceedingly damp and chill. Jugurtha himself, when\r\nstripped of his clothes by the executioners, and let down into it from\r\nthe hole in the roof, exclaimed with grim humour, \"By Hercules, how\r\ncold your bath is!\" A more hideous and heart-breaking dungeon it is\r\nimpossible to imagine. Not a ray of light can penetrate the profound\r\ndarkness of this living tomb. Sallust spoke of the appearance of it in\r\nhis day, from the filth, the gloom, and the smell, as simply terrific.\r\nThe height of the vault is about sixteen feet, its length thirty feet,\r\nand its breadth twenty-two feet. It is cased with huge masses of\r\nvolcanic stone, arranged in courses, converging towards the roof, not\r\non the principle of the arch, but extending horizontally to a centre,\r\nas we see in some of the Etruscan tombs. This peculiar style of\r\nconstruction proves the very high antiquity of the chamber.\r\n\r\nThis cell played the same part in Roman history which the Tower of\r\nLondon has done in our own. Here, by the orders of Cicero, were\r\nstrangled Lentulus, Cethegus, and one or two more of the accomplices\r\nof Catiline, in his famous conspiracy. Here was murdered, under\r\ncircumstances of great baseness, Vercingetorix, the young and gallant\r\nchief of the Gauls, whose bravery called forth the highest qualities\r\nof Julius Cæsar's military genius, and who, when success abandoned his\r\narms, boldly gave himself up as an offering to appease the anger of\r\nthe Romans. Here perished Sejanus, the minister and son-in-law of\r\nTiberius, who was detected in a conspiracy against the emperor, and\r\nrichly deserved his fate on account of his cruelty and treachery.\r\nHere also was put to death Simon Bar-Gioras, the governor of the\r\nrevolted Jews during the last dreadful siege of Jerusalem, who was\r\ntaken prisoner, and after gracing the triumph of the emperor Titus at\r\nRome, shared the fate which usually happened to captives after such an\r\nexhibition.\r\n\r\nFrom the Tullianum or Prison of St. Peter, we were led through a\r\ntortuous subterranean passage of Etruscan character, a hundred yards\r\nlong, cut out of the rock. It was so low that we had to stoop all the\r\nway, and in some places almost to creep, and so narrow that a very\r\nstout person would have some difficulty in forcing himself through.\r\nThe floor was here and there wet with the overflowing of neighbouring\r\ndrains, which exhaled a noisome smell; and we had to pick our steps\r\ncarefully through thick greasy mud, which on the slopes was very\r\nslippery and disagreeable. We followed each other in Indian file,\r\nstooping low, each with a wax taper burning dimly in the damp\r\natmosphere, and presenting a most picturesque appearance. This passage\r\nwas discovered only a few years ago. Numerous passages of a similar\r\nnature are said to penetrate the volcanic rock on which the Capitol\r\nstands, in every direction, like the galleries of an ant's nest. Some\r\nof these have been exposed, and others walled up. They connect the\r\nPrison with the _Cloaca_, and doubtless furnished means by which the\r\nbodies of criminals who had been executed might be secretly disposed\r\nof. The passage in question brought us to four other chambers, each\r\ndarker and more dismal than the other, and partially filled with heaps\r\nof rubbish and masses of stone that had fallen from their roofs and\r\nsides. At the top of each vault there was a man-hole for letting a\r\nprisoner down with cords into it. A visit to these six vaults of the\r\nMamertine Prison gives one an idea that can never be forgotten of the\r\ncruelty and tyranny which underlay all the gorgeous despotism of Rome,\r\nalike in the kingly, republican, and imperial periods. Some of the\r\nremains may still be seen of the _Scalæ Gemoniæ_, the \"steps of\r\nsighs,\" down which the bodies of those who were executed were thrown,\r\nto be exposed to the insults of the populace. The only circumstance\r\nthat relieves the intolerable gloom of the associations of the Prison\r\nis, that Nævius is said to have written two of his plays while he was\r\nconfined in it for his attacks on the aristocracy; a circumstance\r\nwhich links it to the Tower of London, which has also its literary\r\nreminiscences. After having been immured so long in such disagreeable\r\nphysical darkness--appropriate emblem of the deeds of horror committed\r\nin it--we were truly glad to catch at last a faint glimmer of daylight\r\nshimmering into the uppermost passage, and to emerge into the open\r\nsunshine, from beneath a house at the farther end of the Vicolo del\r\nGhettarello.\r\n\r\nA modern carriage-road used to pass along this way, leading up to the\r\nPiazza del Campidoglio in front of the Capitol, and cutting the Forum\r\ninto two parts, concealing a considerable portion of it. This\r\nobstruction has now been swept away, and the Forum is fully exposed\r\nfrom end to end. Below this old road we observe the \"nameless column\"\r\nof _Childe Harold_, which long stood with its base buried, and was\r\ntaken for the ruins of a temple. When excavated in 1813 it was found\r\nto stand on an isolated pedestal, with an inscription recording that\r\nit was erected by the exarch Smaragdus to the emperor Phocas; and the\r\nmode in which the offering was made was worthy of the infamous subject\r\nand the venal dedicator. Nothing can be clearer from the style of the\r\nmonument than that it was stolen from the Temple of Vespasian\r\nadjoining; for it is an exact fellow of the three graceful Corinthian\r\npillars still standing in front of the Ærarium. It was near this\r\npillar, a few years after it was raised, that Gregory the Great,\r\nbefore he became Pope, saw the young Saxon captives exposed to be sold\r\nas slaves, and was so struck with their innocent looks and hopeless\r\nfate that he asked about their nationality and religion. Being told\r\nthat they were Angli, he said, \"_Non Angli, sed Angeli_.\" The\r\nimpression made upon him led to a mission for converting the natives\r\nof Britain, which set out from Rome under St. Augustine in 596. Thus\r\ndoes the column of the infamous usurper Phocas link itself on the\r\nhistoric page with the conversion of Britain to Christianity.\r\n\r\nBeside the Pillar of Phocas are two large marble screens or parapets,\r\nwith magnificent bas-reliefs sculptured on both sides. They were\r\ndiscovered about sixteen years ago _in situ_, and are among the most\r\ninteresting and important objects that have been brought to light by\r\nthe recent excavations in the Forum. Their peculiar form has given\r\nrise to much controversy; some antiquarians regarding them as an\r\navenue along which voters went up to the poll at the popular elections\r\nof consuls, designed either to preserve the voters from the pressure\r\nof the mob, or to prevent any but properly qualified persons from\r\ngetting admission; while others believe that the passage between the\r\ndouble screen led to an altar. This latter opinion seems the more\r\nplausible one, for the sculptures on one side represent the\r\n_suovetaurilia_--a bull, a ram, and a boar, adorned with ribbons and\r\nvittæ, walking in file, which were usually sacrificed for the\r\npurification of Rome at the Lustrum, as the census taken every five\r\nyears was called. The other sculptures on the marble screens consist\r\nof a number of human figures in greater or less relief; one of them\r\nbeing supposed to commemorate the provision made by Trajan for the\r\nchildren of poor or deceased citizens in the orphanage which he was\r\nthe first to found in Rome; and the other, the burning of the deeds\r\nwhich contained the evidence of the public debt of the Roman citizens,\r\nwhich the emperor generously cancelled. But the chief significance of\r\nthe sculptures lies in their background of architectural and other\r\nobjects indicating the locality of the scenes represented. They place\r\nbefore us a view of the Forum as it appeared in the time of Trajan,\r\nand enable us to identify the various objects which then crowded it,\r\nand to fix their relative position. The topographical importance of\r\nthese reliefs has been well discussed by Signor Brizio and Professor\r\nHenzen in the _Proceedings of the Roman Archæological Institute_; and\r\nalso in a paper read by Mr. Nichols before the Society of Antiquaries\r\nin London in 1875. By translating into perspective their somewhat\r\nconventional representations of temples, basilicas, and arches, Mr.\r\nNichols has given us in his monograph on the subject two very\r\neffective pictorial restorations of the Forum as it was in the days of\r\nTrajan. Both the screens exhibit, very distinctly sculptured, a\r\nfig-tree and a statue on a pedestal, which are interesting from their\r\nclassical associations. The tree is not the famous Ruminal fig-tree\r\noriginally of the Palatine and then of the Comitium, but, as Pliny\r\ntells us, a self-sown tree which grew in the mid Forum on the site of\r\nthe Lake of Curtius, which in Ovid's time, as we learn from himself,\r\nwas a dry space of natural ground marked off by a low fence, and\r\nincluding an altar. This fig-tree, along with a vine and an olive,\r\nwhich grew associated with it, was much prized on account of the shade\r\nwhich it afforded. The figure under the fig-tree, carrying a vine stem\r\non its left shoulder, and uplifting its right arm, has been recognised\r\nas that of Marsyas, whose statue was often put in market-places as an\r\nemblem of plenty and indulgence. Martial, Horace, Seneca, and Pliny\r\nall alluded to this statue in the Forum, which stood near the edge of\r\nthe Lake of Curtius, and was crowned with garlands by Julia, the\r\ndaughter of Augustus, during her disgraceful assignations beside it\r\nwith her lovers at night.\r\n\r\nOn the east side of the Forum the excavations have been stopped in the\r\nmeantime, as the modern level of the ground is occupied by valuable\r\nhouses, and two very interesting old churches, Santa Martina and Sta.\r\nAdriano. Under the part not yet exhumed lie the remains of the\r\nearliest of all the Basilicas, the Basilica of Porcia, built by the\r\nelder Cato in the immediate vicinity of the Curia, and also those of\r\nthe famous Basilica Æmilia, which probably extended along the greater\r\npart of the east side of the Forum. Some of the most important\r\nmonuments of ancient Rome, known to us only by the writings of classic\r\nauthors, doubtless lie buried in this locality. Under the church of\r\nSta. Adriano, the famous Curia Hostilia or Senate House, attributed to\r\nTullus Hostilius, stood. The original building was destroyed by fire\r\nat the funeral of Clodius, through the carelessness of the populace,\r\nwho insisted upon burning his body within it; but it was replaced by\r\nthe Curia Julia, which was rebuilt by Augustus, who added to it an\r\nimportant structure, called in the Ancyran inscription Chalcidicum,\r\nfor the convenience of the senators. Around it stood the statues of\r\nmen who had rendered important services to the state; and not far off\r\nwas an altar and statue of Victory, which formed the last\r\nrallying-ground of expiring paganism against the dominating\r\nChristianity of the empire. In the year 382 the Christian party had\r\nremoved this altar and statue; and when their restoration was demanded\r\nby Symmachus, the request was refused by Ambrose, as opposed to the\r\nconscience of the Christian senators; and this decision being ratified\r\nby the votes of the assembly, the doom of paganism, as the national\r\nreligion, was in consequence sealed. The Curia Julia ceased to serve\r\nits original purpose at the death of Caligula, when the consuls\r\nconvoked the senate in the Capitol instead, to mark their aversion to\r\nthe rule of the Cæsars; and the building was probably burnt down and\r\nfinally rebuilt in the time of Diocletian. One of the most curious\r\nuses to which it was put, was to mark the _Suprema tempestas_, which\r\nclosed the hours of legal business, by means of its shadow projected\r\non the pavement; a primitive mode of reckoning time which existed\r\nbefore the first Punic war, and was afterwards superseded by a\r\nsun-dial and a clepsydra or water-clock erected in the Forum.\r\n\r\nNear the Curia under the present roadway must lie the site of the\r\nComitium, or meeting-place of the Roman burgesses. This was far the\r\nmost important spot in the Forum in the days of the Republic. It was\r\nnot a covered building, but a templum or a consecrated space open to\r\nthe air. In its area grew a fig-tree, in commemoration of the sacred\r\ntree which sheltered Romulus and Remus in their infancy; and we read\r\nof drops of blood and milk falling upon it as omens from the sky. One\r\nof the stones on its pavement, from its extraordinary blackness, was\r\ncalled the tombstone of Romulus, and a number of statues adorned its\r\nsides, including the three Sibyls, which gave the name of \"In Tria\r\nFata\" down to medieval times to this part of the Forum. From its\r\nrostra, or stone platform, addresses were delivered by political\r\nagitators to open-air assemblies of the people. The Comitium reminds\r\nus very strikingly of the municipal origin of the Roman empire. In\r\nprimitive times that mode of government was admirably adapted to the\r\nnecessities of the city; but when Rome became mistress of the world it\r\nwas found unfitted to discharge imperial functions. The establishment\r\nof the monarchical form of Government overthrew the Comitium, and with\r\nit the very life of the Roman city.\r\n\r\nIn front of the church of S. Adriano--said to be no other than the\r\nactual Curia of Diocletian, though greatly altered and partly rebuilt\r\nby Pope Honorius I. in the year 630--are some fragments of the\r\nBasilica Æmilia. This court was erected on the site of the Basilica\r\nFulvia, and superseded by a more splendid building called the Basilica\r\nPauli, which was the Bourse or Exchange of ancient Rome. The building\r\nof this last Basilica was interrupted for a long time by the disorders\r\nconsequent on the assassination of Cæsar. When finished, it was\r\nconsidered to be one of the most magnificent buildings in the world;\r\nand was especially admired on account of its beautiful columns of\r\nPhrygian marble. These were afterwards removed to decorate the church\r\nof St. Paul outside the gate, where some of them that survived the\r\nburning of the old edifice may be seen behind the high altar of the\r\nnew. Between the Curia and the Basilica Æmilia is supposed to have\r\nstood the celebrated Temple of Janus, built according to Livy by Numa\r\nPompilius, the closing or opening of which was the signal of peace or\r\nwar. It was probably at first one of the ancient gates in a line of\r\nfortifications uniting the Capitol with the Palatine; and afterwards\r\ncomprised, besides a passage-way through which a great part of the\r\ntraffic of Rome passed, a diminutive bronze temple containing a bronze\r\nstatue of the venerable deity of the Sabines, whose one face looked to\r\nthe east, and the other to the west. The bronze gates of the temple\r\nwere closed by Augustus for the third time after the battle of Actium,\r\nand finally shut when Christianity became the religion of the empire.\r\nProcopius saw the temple still standing in the sixth century; and he\r\ntells us that, during the siege of the city by the Goths, when it was\r\ndefended by Belisarius, some of the adherents of the old pagan\r\nsuperstition made a secret attempt to open the shrine and set the god\r\nat liberty.\r\n\r\nOne gazes at the wall of earth and rubbish, fifteen feet deep, marking\r\nthe present limit of the excavations in this direction, with a\r\nprofound longing that the obstruction could be removed at once, and\r\nthe rich antiquarian treasures lying hid underneath brought to light.\r\nFew things in Rome appealed more powerfully to my curiosity than this\r\nhuge bank of _débris_, behind and beneath which imagination was free\r\nto picture all kinds of possibilities. On the part that has been\r\nuncovered, we see a row of brick bases on which had stood monuments of\r\ngilt bronze to some of the distinguished men of Rome; the remains of a\r\nline of shops of the third century demolished during the excavations;\r\nthe pedestal of what is said by some to have been Domitian's and by\r\nothers Constantine's gigantic equestrian statue; and farther down,\r\nrude heaps of masonry, belonging to the substructures of the Rostra\r\nand Temple of Julius Cæsar. Part of the curved wall of the Rostra may\r\nstill be seen built of large blocks of travertine; and in front is a\r\nfixed platform, where a large number of people could stand and listen\r\nto the speaker. This Rostra is specially interesting because it was\r\nconstructed in the year of Cæsar's death, and was intended to mark the\r\ndesign of the great triumvir to destroy the memory of the old\r\noligarchy by separating the rostra or \"hustings\" from their former\r\nconnection with the senate and comitia, and make them entirely popular\r\ninstitutions. The front of it was afterwards adorned by Augustus with\r\nthe beaks of ships taken at Actium. The small Heroön or Temple of\r\nCæsar behind the Rostra was erected on the spot where the body of\r\nCæsar was burned before the house which he had so long inhabited, and\r\nin a part of the Forum especially associated with his greatest\r\npolitical triumphs. It superseded an altar and lofty column of\r\nNumidian marble, at which the people had previously offered sacrifices\r\nto the memory of their idol, the first mortal in Rome raised to the\r\nrank of the gods; an honour justified, they imagined, not only by his\r\ngreat deeds, but also by his alleged descent from Venus Anadyomene.\r\n\r\nRunning down the middle of the Forum is a rough, ancient causeway,\r\nwith its blocks of lava still in their original position, but so\r\ndisjointed that it is no easy task walking over them. On the other\r\nside is the raised platform of the Basilica Julia of Augustus,\r\nextending from north to south, the whole length of the Forum, with\r\nsteps leading up to it from the paved street. This stupendous law\r\ncourt, the grandest in Rome where Trajan sat to administer justice,\r\nand from whose roof Caligula day after day lavishly threw down money\r\nto the people, has, by its own identity being established beyond\r\ndispute, more than any other discovery helped to determine the\r\ntopography of the Roman Forum. It was begun by Julius Cæsar on the\r\nsite of the older Basilica Sempronia, which had previously partially\r\nreplaced the _Veteres Tabernæ_ or shops of early times required for\r\nthe trades carried on in a market-place, and also the schools for\r\nchildren where Appius Claudius had first seen Virginia reading. Having\r\nbeen partially destroyed by fire, Augustus afterwards completed and\r\ngreatly enlarged the building. It was used as the place of meeting of\r\nthe _Centumviri_, a court which we learn from the younger Pliny, who\r\nhimself practised before it, had a hundred and eight judges sitting in\r\nfour separate tribunals, within sight and hearing of one another, like\r\nthe old courts in Westminster Hall. The Basilica is not yet entirely\r\nexcavated, a large part of its breadth being still under modern\r\nbuildings. It consisted of a series of plain, massive arches built of\r\ntravertine. The pavement is wonderfully perfect, being composed of a\r\nmosaic pattern of valuable marbles, doubtless saved from destruction\r\nor removal to build some church or palace by the fortunate\r\ncircumstance that the ruins of the Basilica covered and concealed them\r\nat an early period. On this pavement and on the steps leading up to it\r\nare incised numerous squares and circles which are supposed to have\r\nbeen tabulæ lusoriæ, or gaming-tables. A few have inscriptions near\r\nthem alluding to their use. Cicero mentions the dice-players of the\r\nForum with reprobation; and the fact that such sports should have\r\nintruded into the courts of justice shows that the Romans had lost at\r\nthis time their early veneration for the law. The rows of brick arches\r\nseen on the platform are mere modern restorations, placed there by\r\nCavaliere Rosa to indicate the supposed original plan of the building.\r\nAt the south end of it an opening in the pavement shows a part of the\r\nCloaca Maxima, with the sewerage passing through it underneath.\r\n\r\nThe ancient street between the Basilica Julia and the Temple of Castor\r\nand Pollux, is undoubtedly the famous _Vicus Tuscus_, so called after\r\nthe Etruscan soldiers who belonged to the army of Porsenna, and, being\r\ndefeated at Ariccia, took refuge in this part of Rome. This street, so\r\noften mentioned by classic writers, led to the Circus Maximus, and is\r\nnow identified with the Via dei Fienili; the point of departure from\r\nthe Forum being marked by a statue of Vertumnus, the Etruscan god, the\r\nruined pedestal of which, in all likelihood, is that which has lately\r\nbeen unveiled on the steps at the north-east corner of the Basilica\r\nJulia. It was considered almost as sacred as the Via Sacra itself,\r\nbeing the route taken by the great procession of the Circensian games,\r\nin which the statues of the gods were carried in cars from the Capitol\r\nthrough the Forum to the circus. In front of the Basilica Julia, and\r\non the opposite side of the way, so numerous were the statues which\r\nJulius Cæsar contrived to crowd together, that the Emperor\r\nConstantine, during his famous visit to Rome, is said to have been\r\nalmost stupefied with amazement. Some such feeling is produced in our\r\nown minds when we reflect that the bewildering array of sculptures in\r\nthe Roman galleries, admired by a concourse of pilgrims from every\r\ncountry, are but chance discoveries, unnoticed by history, and of no\r\naccount in their own time. What must have been the feast of splendour\r\nof which these are but the crumbs!\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most beautiful of the ruins of the Forum are the three\r\nmarble columns of the Temple of Castor and Pollux near the Basilica\r\nJulia. They are the only prominent objects on the south-west side of\r\nthe Forum, and at once arrest the eye by their matchless symmetry and\r\ngrace. Time has dealt very hardly with them, battering their shapely\r\ncolumns and rich Corinthian capitals, and discolouring their pure\r\nwhite Pentelic marble. But it has not succeeded in destroying their\r\nwonderful beauty; and the russet hues with which they have been\r\nstained by the long lapse of the ages have rather added to them the\r\ncharm of antique picturesqueness. They rest upon a huge mound of\r\nbroken masonry, in the interstices of which Nature has sown her seeds\r\nof minute life, which spread over it a tender pall of bright\r\nvegetation. The three columns are bound together by iron rods, and\r\nstill further kept in position by the fragments of architrave and\r\ncornice supported by them. They are forty-eight feet in height and\r\nnearly five feet in diameter, while their flutings are nine inches\r\nacross. Around the basement a large quantity of broken columns,\r\ncapitals, and pedestals has been disinterred, some of which have\r\nacquired an historic renown on account of the purposes which they have\r\nserved in the fine arts. Michael Angelo converted one huge fragment\r\ninto the pedestal of the celebrated bronze equestrian statue of Marcus\r\nAurelius, which he transferred from its original site in front of the\r\nArch of Septimius Severus, where it had stood for thirteen or fourteen\r\ncenturies, to the front of the Capitol; while out of another fragment\r\nRaphael carved the well-known statue of Jonah sitting on a whale, to\r\nbe seen in the Chigi Chapel of Sta. Maria del Popolo, the only piece\r\nof sculpture executed by the immortal painter. The Italian Government\r\nhas entirely excavated the ruins, and thus set at rest the numerous\r\ncontroversies among antiquaries regarding its true name.\r\n\r\nThe temple of Castor and Pollux probably dates as far back as the year\r\n487 before Christ, when the dictator Postumius vowed to build a\r\nmonument in commemoration of his victory at the great battle of Lake\r\nRegillus, with which the mythical history of Rome closes. It recalls\r\nthe well-known romantic legend of the mysterious interference of the\r\nDioscuri in that memorable struggle which Macaulay has woven into one\r\nof the most spirited of his Lays. The temple is supposed to have been\r\nerected on the spot where the divine Twins announced the victory to\r\nthe people in the Forum at the close of the day. About twenty feet\r\nfrom the eastern corner of the temple are slight remains of a shallow\r\noval basin, which has been identified as the lake or fountain of\r\nJuturna, the wife of Janus, the Sabine war-god, where the Dioscuri\r\nwashed their armour and horses from the blood and dust of the fray. It\r\nwas probably at first a natural spring gushing out of the tufa rock of\r\nthe Palatine Hill, but being dried up, it became in later times a\r\n_lacus_ or basin artificially supplied with water. For long ages\r\nafterwards the anniversary of the great battle was celebrated every\r\nyear on the fifteenth of July by a splendid pageant worthy of the\r\ngreatness of the empire. The Roman knights, clothed in purple robes,\r\nand crowned with olive wreaths, and bearing their trophies, first\r\noffered sacrifice in the shrine of Castor and Pollux, and then formed\r\na procession, in which five thousand persons sometimes took part,\r\nwhich filed in front of the temple and marched through the city.\r\n\r\nThe original building having stood for nearly five hundred years, it\r\nbegan to exhibit signs of decay, and accordingly it was rebuilt upon\r\nthe old foundations by Augustus, and dedicated by Tiberius. The podium\r\nor mass of rubble masonry therefore which we see beneath the three\r\ncolumns at the present day belongs to the time of the kings, while the\r\ncolumns themselves belong to the imperial period. Caligula used the\r\ntemple as a vestibule to his palace on the Palatine Hill immediately\r\nbehind. On the brow of that hill, separated only by the pavement of\r\nthe modern street, projects a labyrinth of vaults, arches, and broken\r\nwalls, a mighty maze of desolation without a plan, so interspersed\r\nwith verdure and foliage that \"it looks as much a landscape as a\r\nruin.\" This is supposed to be the palace of Caligula; and its remains\r\nabundantly attest the extraordinary magnificence of this imperial\r\ndomain, which contained all that was rich and rare from the golden\r\nEast, from beyond the snowy Alps, and from Greece, the home of art.\r\nThe substructions of this mighty ruin are truly astonishing; they are\r\nso vast, so massive, so enduring, that they seem as if built by\r\ngiants. Concealed by modern houses built up against the foot of the\r\npalace, some of the remains of the famous bridge which Caligula threw\r\nobliquely over the Forum can be made out; two of the tall brick piers\r\nare visible above the houses, and in the gable of the outer house the\r\nspring of one of the arches can be distinctly seen. The bridge was\r\nconstructed by Caligula for the purpose of connecting his palace with\r\nthe Capitol, on the summit of which stood the magnificent Temple of\r\nJupiter, so that, as he said himself, he might be able to converse\r\nconveniently with his colleague, the greatest of the gods! It is\r\nprobable that it served more than one purpose; that it was used both\r\nas an aqueduct and a road for horses and chariots from the Palatine to\r\nthe Capitol. Be this as it may, it must have been a stupendous\r\nstructure, nearly a quarter of a mile long, and about a hundred feet\r\nhigh, striding over the whole diagonal of the Forum, with a double or\r\ntriple tier of arches, like the remains of the Claudian aqueduct that\r\nspans the Campagna.\r\n\r\nThe immediate vicinity of the Temple of Castor and Pollux is full of\r\ninterest to the classical student. To the right of it are the remains\r\nof the Regia or Royal Palace, the official residence of the early\r\nkings of Rome, and afterwards, during the whole period of the\r\nRepublic, of the Pontifex Maximus, as the real head of the State as\r\nwell as the Church. Numa Pompilius resided here in the hope that, by\r\noccupying neutral ground, he might conciliate the Latins of the\r\nPalatine and the Sabines of the Capitoline Hills. It was also the home\r\nof Julius Cæsar during the greater part of his life, where Calpurnia,\r\nhis wife, dreamed that the pediment of the house had fallen down, and\r\nthe sacred weapons in the Sacrarium were stirred by a supernatural\r\npower; an omen that was but too truly fulfilled when Cæsar went forth\r\nto the Forum on the fatal Ides of March, and was carried back a bloody\r\ncorpse from the Curia of Pompey. It ceased to become the residence of\r\nthe Pontifex when Augustus bought the house of Hortensius on the\r\nPalatine, and elected to dwell there instead; and was therefore given\r\nover to the Vestal Virgins to increase their scanty accommodation. The\r\n_Atrium Vestæ_, or convent of the Vestal Virgins, adjoined the Regia,\r\nand behind it, along the lower slope of the Palatine, stretched the\r\nsacred grove of Vesta, which seems to have been used as a place of\r\nprivileged interment for the sisterhood, as a number of gravestones\r\nwith the names of vestal virgins upon them were found in digging the\r\nfoundations of the church of Sta. Maria Liberatrice in the\r\nseventeenth century. The residence of the Pontifex Maximus and of the\r\nVestal Virgins, who were regarded as the highest and holiest\r\npersonages in the State, gave an air of great respectability to this\r\nneighbourhood, and it became in consequence the fashionable quarter of\r\nRome. Close beside the house of the Vestal Virgins was the far-famed\r\nTemple of Vesta, in which they ministered, whose podium or basement,\r\nwhich is a mere circular mound of rough masonry, may be seen on the\r\nspot.\r\n\r\nThe worship of Vesta, the goddess of the household fire, was one of\r\nthe most primitive forms of religion. It doubtless arose from the\r\ngreat difficulty in prehistoric times of producing fire by rubbing two\r\nsticks against one another. Such a flame once procured would be\r\ncarefully guarded against extinction in some central spot by the\r\nunmarried women of the household, who had nothing else to do. And from\r\nthis central fire all the household fires of the settlement would be\r\nobtained. A relic of this prehistoric custom existed in the rule that\r\nif the sacred vestal fire was ever allowed to go out it could only be\r\nkindled anew by the primitive process of friction. The worship of\r\nVesta survived an old world of exhausted craters and extinct\r\nvolcanoes, with which was buried a world of lost nations. The\r\nPelasgians brought to Italy the stone of the domestic hearth, the\r\nfoundation of the family, and the tombstone, the boundary of the\r\nfields divided after the death of the head of the family, the\r\nfoundation of property; and upon this double base arose the great\r\ndistinctive edifice of the Roman Law, the special gift of Rome to the\r\ncivilisation of the world. Rhea Sylvia, mother of Romulus, was a\r\nVestal Virgin of Alba, which shows that the worship of Vesta existed\r\nin this region long before the foundation of Rome. The origin of the\r\nfirst temple and of the institutions of Vestal Virgins for its service\r\nwas attributed to Numa Pompilius. The first building, as Ovid tells\r\nus, was constructed with wattled walls and a thatched roof like the\r\nprimitive huts of the inhabitants. It was little more than a covered\r\nfireplace. It was the public hearth of the new city, round which were\r\ngathered all the private ones. On it burned continually the sacred\r\nfire, the symbol of the life of the state, which was believed to have\r\nbeen brought from Troy, and the continuance of which was connected by\r\nsuperstition with the fortunes of Rome. In the secret penetralia of\r\nthe temple, where no man was allowed to enter, was kept with\r\nscrupulous care, for its preservation was equally bound up with the\r\nsafety of the empire, the Palladium, or image of Pallas, saved from\r\nthe destruction of Troy, and which was supposed to have originally\r\nfallen from heaven. The circular form and the domed roof of the temple\r\nwere survivals of the prehistoric huts of the Aborigines, which were\r\ninvariably round, as the traces of their foundations show. With the\r\nexception of the Palladium, which remained invisible during all the\r\nages to ordinary mortal eyes until the destructive fire in the Forum,\r\nin the reign of Commodus, compelled the Vestal Virgins to expose it in\r\nremoving it for safety to the imperial court, there was in primitive\r\ntimes no statue or material representation of the goddess except the\r\nsacred fire in the mysterious shrine of the temple. Indeed the Romans,\r\nas Plutarch tells us, raised no statue to the gods until the year of\r\nRome 170. In this respect the religion of the Romans, whose divinities\r\nhad no participation in the life and passions of men, and had nothing\r\nto do with the human form, differed widely from the religion of the\r\nGreeks, which, inspired by the sentiment of the beautiful in man and\r\nnature, gave birth to art.\r\n\r\nThe Temple of Vesta, as might have been expected, shared in all the\r\nwonderful changes of Roman history. It was abandoned when the Gauls\r\nentered Rome, and the Vestal Virgins took the sacred fire and the\r\nPalladium to Cære in Etruria for safety. It was destroyed two hundred\r\nand forty-one years before Christ, when L. Metellus, the Pontifex\r\nMaximus at the time, saved the Palladium with the loss of his\r\neyesight, and consequently of his priesthood, for which a statue was\r\nerected to him in the Capitol. It was consumed in the great fire of\r\nNero, and rebuilt by Vespasian, on some of whose coins it is\r\nrepresented. It was finally burnt down in the fire of Commodus, which\r\ndestroyed at the same time many important buildings in the Forum. The\r\nworship of Vesta was prohibited by Gratianus in the year 382 of our\r\nera, and the public maintenance of the Vestal Virgins abandoned, in\r\nspite of the protestations of Symmachus and the forlorn hope of the\r\npagan party. Great as was the reverence paid to the shrine of Vesta,\r\nnot being a temple in the proper sense of the term, as it was not\r\nconsecrated by augury, it had not the right of sanctuary. Mucius\r\nScævola, the unfortunate Pontifex Maximus, was murdered beside the\r\naltar by order of Marius, and his blood sprinkled the image of the\r\ngoddess; and Piso Licinianus, the adopted son of Galba, after the\r\nassassination of that emperor beside the Curtian Lake in the Forum,\r\nwas dragged out from the innermost shrine of the temple, to which he\r\nhad fled for refuge, and barbarously massacred at the door. But it is\r\nimpossible to dwell upon all the remarkable events with which this\r\nhaunted shrine of Rome's earliest and most beautiful worship is\r\nassociated. Certainly no greater object of interest has been exhumed\r\namong all the antiquities of the Eternal City than the little round\r\nmass of shapeless masonry which has been identified beyond all\r\nreasonable doubt as the basement of the world-renowned temple, the\r\nhousehold hearth of old Rome.\r\n\r\nOpposite the Temple of Vesta, at the north-east corner of the Forum,\r\nwhere it ends, is the magnificent façade of the Temple of Antoninus\r\nPius and Faustina, the most perfect of all the Roman temples. There\r\nare six splendid Corinthian columns in front and two at the sides,\r\neach composed of a single block of green ripple-marked Cipollino\r\nmarble, about forty-six feet in height and five feet in diameter, with\r\nbases and capitals of marble, originally white, but now rusty and\r\ndiscoloured by age; all beautifully proportioned and carved in the\r\nfinest style of ancient art. These columns were buried to half their\r\nheight in medieval times; and houses were built up against and between\r\nthem, the marks of whose roofs are still visible in indentations near\r\ntheir summits. These houses were removed, and the ground excavated\r\ndown to the bases of the columns in the sixteenth century by Palladio,\r\nrevealing a grand flight of marble steps, twenty-one in number,\r\nleading up to the temple from the street. The excavations at that time\r\nwere made for the purpose of finding marbles and building materials\r\nfor the Church of St. Peter's. Two sides of the cella of the temple\r\nstill remain, formed by large massive blocks of peperino, probably\r\ntaken from the second wall of Rome, which must have passed very near\r\nto the east end of this temple; for the ancient Roman architects were\r\nas unscrupulous in appropriating the relics of former ages as their\r\nsuccessors. The roughness of these walls was hidden by an outer casing\r\nof marble, ornamented with pilasters, of which only the small capitals\r\nnow remain. Both the cella and the portico still retain a large\r\nportion of their magnificent marble entablature; and the frieze and\r\ncornice are richly covered with carvings of vases and candelabra,\r\nguarded by griffins, exquisite in design and execution. The marble\r\nslabs that covered the whole outside of the temple had been burnt for\r\nlime in a kiln that stood in front of the portico in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, and in this lime-kiln were found fragments of statues,\r\nbas-reliefs, and inscriptions, which were about to be destroyed in\r\nthat barbarous fashion.\r\n\r\nThe temple was originally begun by Antoninus Pius to the memory of his\r\nunworthy wife Faustina in the year 142 of our era, but being\r\nunfinished at his death, it was dedicated by the senate to both their\r\nnames. We see it represented in all its magnificence on some of the\r\ncoins of this emperor. In the year 1430 Pope Martin V. built over its\r\nremains a church called S. Lorenzo in Miranda, whose singular ugliness\r\nwas in striking contrast to the grandeur of the venerable ruin which\r\nembraced it. The floor of this church was ten feet above the original\r\nlevel of the temple, and its roof was carried twenty feet above its\r\ncornice. It contained several tombs of the Roman apothecaries, to\r\nwhose Corporation it belonged. No one will regret that it has been\r\nremoved; the excavations in front of it having reduced the level of\r\nthe ground far below its doorway, and thus cut off the approach. It is\r\nstrange to think of the two different kinds of worship carried on at\r\nsuch widely separated intervals within this remarkable building, first\r\na pagan temple and then a Christian church--worship so different in\r\nname and yet so like in reality; for the divine honours paid to a\r\nmortal emperor and his wife were transferred in after ages to frail\r\nmortals such as Saint Laurence and the Virgin Mary. We are reminded by\r\nthe inscription above the portico of the temple, \"Divo Antonino et\r\nDivæ Faustina,\" that the government of the Cæsars had become an\r\nearthly omnipotence in the estimation of the Romans and the subject\r\nnations. They looked alone to Cæsar for all their good, and from him\r\nthey feared their chiefest evil. He had become to them their\r\nprovidence or their fate. The adoration offered to him was not a mere\r\nact of homage or sign of fealty, but was most truly and in the highest\r\nsense a worship as to a divine being.\r\n\r\nThe view in this part of the Forum, looking down from the Antonine\r\nTemple, is most striking and suggestive. It reveals some of the\r\ngrandest objects of ancient Rome. Immediately beyond is the hoary old\r\nchurch of SS. Cosma e Damiano, with mosaics of the sixth century on\r\nits tribune, built out of three ancient temples, as Dr. Parker has\r\nclearly proved--the round Temple of Romulus Maxentius, the Temple of\r\nVenus, and the Temple of Rome. The south wall of this last-mentioned\r\ntemple, built of huge square blocks of tufa, to which the marble plan\r\nof Rome was fastened by metal hooks, may still be seen in the church;\r\nand it is interesting as being the last pagan temple which remained in\r\nuse in Rome. Here was the last struggle of paganism with the unbelief\r\nwhich itself inspired. The gods of the Pantheon had lost all\r\nsignificance. The worship of abstract qualities, such as Concord and\r\nVictory, or of the personification of a local providence in the city\r\nof Rome itself, could not satisfy the longing of the human soul. As\r\nreligion decayed the worship of the gods was superseded by the worship\r\nof the emperor. Their statues were decapitated and the head of the\r\nemperor was placed upon them. On the statue of Olympic Jove appeared\r\nthe bust of the contemptible Caligula; and this incongruous adaptation\r\nrepresented the change of the popular faith from its former heavenly\r\nidealisations to the most grovelling fetish worship of the time. This\r\ndeification of the emperors avenged its terrible blasphemy by the\r\nsublime wickedness of those who were so raised above humanity. Here,\r\nin this last pagan temple of Rome, converted into one of the earliest\r\nChristian churches, we see the darkness and despair of the heathen\r\nworld preparing for that joyful morning light of Christianity which\r\nhas transferred the faith of mankind to foundations which can never\r\nmore be shaken. Immediately beyond in the background are the huge\r\ngloomy arches of the Basilica of Constantine, fretted with coffers,\r\nsuspended in mid-air for upwards of sixteen centuries, in defiance of\r\nthe laws of gravity and the ravages of time and of human destroyers,\r\ntaken as a model for churches by Roman architects, though built\r\noriginally for a law court. In front is the Arch of Titus, with its\r\nwell-known sculptures of the spoils from the Temple of Jerusalem,\r\nspanning the highest point of the Via Sacra. And closing up the view\r\nis the grandest ruin in the world, the stupendous broken circle of the\r\nColosseum, rising tier above tier into the blue sky, burnt deep brown\r\nby the suns of ages, holding the spectator breathless with wonder, and\r\nthrilling the mind with the awful associations connected with it.\r\n\r\nThe Forum lies like an open sepulchre in the heart of old Rome. All is\r\ndeath there; the death of nature and the death of a race whose long\r\nhistory has done more to shape the destiny of the world than any\r\nother. The soil beneath our feet is formed by the ashes of an extinct\r\nfire, and by the dust of a vanished empire. Everywhere the ruins of\r\ntime and of man are mingled with the relics of an older creation; and\r\nthe sculptured marbles of the temples and law courts, where Cæsar\r\nworshipped and Cicero pled, lie scattered amid the tufa-blocks, the\r\ncinders of the long quiescent volcanoes of the Campagna. Nature and\r\nman have both accomplished their work in this spot; and the relics\r\nthey have left behind are only the exuviæ of the chrysalis out of\r\nwhich the butterfly has emerged, or the empty wave-worn shells left\r\nhigh and dry upon an ancient coast-line. It is a remarkable\r\ncircumstance that the way in which the Forum originated was the very\r\nway in which it was destroyed. The cradle of Roman greatness became\r\nits tomb. The Forum originated in the volcanic fires of earth; it\r\npassed away in the incendiary fires of man. In the month of May 1084\r\nthe Norman leader, Robert Guiscard, came with his troops to rescue\r\nGregory VII. from the German army which besieged Rome. Then broke\r\nout--whether by accident or design is not known--the terrible\r\nconflagration which extended from the Capitol to the Coelian Hill, but\r\nraged with the greatest intensity in the Forum. In that catastrophe\r\nclassical Rome passed away, and from the ashes of the fire arose the\r\nPhoenix of modern Rome. The greatest of physical empires was wrecked\r\non this spot, and out of the wreck was constructed the greatest\r\nspiritual empire the world has ever known. For the Roman Pontificate,\r\nto use the famous saying of Hobbes, was but the ghost of the deceased\r\nRoman Empire sitting crowned upon the grave thereof.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE EGYPTIAN OBELISKS\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the first objects that arrest the attention and powerfully\r\nexcite the curiosity of the visitor in Rome are the Egyptian obelisks.\r\nThey remind him impressively that the oldest things in this city of\r\nages are but as of yesterday in comparison with these imperishable\r\nrelics of the earliest civilisation. At one time it is said that there\r\nwere no less than forty-eight obelisks erected in Rome,--six of the\r\nlargest size and forty-two of the smaller,--all conveyed at enormous\r\ncost and with almost incredible labour from the banks of the Nile to\r\nthe banks of the Tiber. Upwards of thirty of them have perished\r\nwithout leaving any trace behind. They are doubtless buried deep under\r\nthe ruins of ancient Rome, but the chance of their disinterment is\r\nvery problematical. One obelisk, indeed, was exposed a hundred and\r\nforty years ago in the square of the principal church of the Jesuits,\r\nnear the Pantheon; but being found to be broken, and also to underlie\r\na corner of the church and the greater part of an adjoining palace, so\r\nthat it could not be extracted without seriously injuring these\r\nbuildings, it was covered up again, and was thus lost to the world. As\r\nit is, we find in Rome the largest collection of obelisks that exists\r\nat the present day in the world, and the best field for studying them.\r\n\r\nObelisks were dedicated to the sun, which was the central object of\r\nworship, and occupied the most conspicuous position in the religious\r\nsystem of the oldest nations. Sun-worship, that which waited upon some\r\nhill-top to catch the first beams of the morning that created a new\r\nday, is the oldest and the most natural of all kinds of worship. He\r\nwas adored as the source of all the life and motion and force in the\r\nworld by the most primitive people; and we find numerous traces of\r\nthis ancient sun-worship in the rude stone monuments, with their\r\ncup-shaped symbols, that have survived on our moors, in many of the\r\nold customs which still linger in our Christianity, and in the name by\r\nwhich the most sacred day of the week is commonly known among us. All\r\nthe benefits conferred upon our world by the sun must have been\r\nstrikingly apparent to the ancient Egyptians, dwelling in a land\r\nexposed to the sun's vertical rays, and clothed with almost tropical\r\nbeauty and luxuriance. When they watched the ebbing of the overflowing\r\nwaters of the Nile, and saw the moist earth on which the sun's rays\r\nfell, quickened at once into a marvellous profusion of plant and\r\nanimal life, they naturally regarded the sun as the Creator, and so\r\ndeified him in that capacity. The origin of all life, vegetable and\r\nanimal, to those who stood, as it were, by its cradle, when the world\r\nwas young and haunted by heaven, seemed a greater mystery and wonder\r\nthan it is to us in these later faithless ages. Long familiarity with\r\nit in its full-grown proportions has made it commonplace to us.\r\n\r\nBoth the obelisk and the pyramid were solar symbols, the obelisk being\r\nthe symbol of the rising sun, and the pyramid of the setting. The\r\nfundamental idea of the obelisk was that of creation by light; that of\r\nthe pyramid, death through the extinction of light. And this\r\nsymbolical difference between the two objects was practically\r\nexpressed by the different situations in which they were placed; the\r\nobelisks being all located on the eastern side of the Nile, that being\r\nthe region of the rising sun, and of the dawn of life; while the\r\npyramids are all found on the western bank of the river, the region\r\nof the sunset, with its awfully sterile hills and silent untravelled\r\ndesert of sand from which no tidings had ever come to living man,\r\nwhere the dead were buried under the shades of night, in their\r\nrock-cut cemeteries. It might thus seem, that by placing obelisks in\r\nour churchyards in association with the dead, we were violating their\r\noriginal significance, and guilty of adding another to the many\r\nincongruities which have arisen from adopting pagan symbols in\r\nChristian burying-places. But in reality we find a deeper reason for\r\nthe association. In some of the oldest sculptures in Egypt, an obelisk\r\nis represented as standing on the top of a pyramid; and by this\r\ncombination it was meant to signify the power of life triumphing over\r\ndeath. And hence the obelisk is the most suitable of all forms to\r\nindicate in our cemeteries the glorious truth of the resurrection,\r\nlife rising victorious out of the transitory condition of death.\r\n\r\nAnd how admirably did the obelisk lend itself to its symbolical\r\npurposes! There was a most wonderful harmony between the idea and the\r\nobject which expressed it. Being composed of the most durable of all\r\nmaterials, the hard indestructible granite, the eternal sun was thus\r\nfittingly represented by an object that lifts its stern finger in\r\nunchangeable defiance of the vicissitudes of the seasons and the ages.\r\nIts highly polished surface and rich rosy red colour, its sharply\r\ndefined lines and narrow proportions, combined with its immense\r\nheight, suggested the brilliancy and hue and form of a pencil of\r\nlight. Its tall red column flashing in the strong morning radiance,\r\nlike a tongue of flame mounting up to its source in the solar fire, or\r\nlike a ray of the halo that rises up on the low horizon of the Libyan\r\ndesert, when the dawn has crimsoned all the eastern heavens, might\r\nthus well be selected as the most suitable object to bring the\r\ninvisible sun-god within the ken of human vision and the range of\r\nhuman worship. The poetical imagination may detect a significance even\r\nin the difference between the material used in the construction of\r\nthe obelisk, and that used in the construction of the pyramid, though\r\nthis may not have been designed by the makers. The obelisks are all\r\nformed of granite, the foundation-stone of the globe, belonging to the\r\noldest azoic formation, which laid down the first basis for the\r\nappearing of life. The pyramids were nearly all made of nummulitic\r\nlimestone composed of the remains of organic life; a material which\r\nbelonged to the latest geologic ages, when whole generations and\r\ndifferent platforms of life had come and gone. Thus significantly does\r\nthe obelisk of granite suggest by its material as by its form the\r\norigin of life, as the pyramid suggests by its material and form the\r\nextinction of life.\r\n\r\nBut not only was the obelisk raised in connection with the worship of\r\nthe sun,--it was also intended to honour the reigning monarch who\r\nerected it, and whose name and titles were engraved upon it along with\r\nthe name of the sun. For it was a fundamental idea of the Egyptian\r\nreligion that the king was not only the son of the solar god, but also\r\nthe visible human representative of his glory. This was a favourite\r\nconception of the ancients. The Incas of Peru regarded themselves as\r\ndirect descendants of the sun; and the monarchs of the burning Asiatic\r\nlands, where the sun rules and dominates everything, assume the name\r\nand title of his sons, and clothe themselves with his splendour. The\r\nobelisks were thus the symbols of the two great correlative\r\nconceptions of the sun in the heavens, and his satellite and\r\nrepresentative on the earth--god and the king. This Egyptian faith, as\r\nattested by the obelisks, the oldest of all the creeds, antecedent to\r\nthe theologies of India, Greece, and Rome, ceased not to be venerated\r\ntill the advent of Christianity swept all material worship away. It\r\nawed, as Mr. Cooper has well observed, the mixed multitude in\r\nAlexandria under the Cæsars, as it had done the primitive Egyptians\r\nunder the oldest Pharaohs. It extended over a space of more than three\r\nthousand years. During all that long period the obelisk was \"the\r\nemblem at once of the vivifying power of the sun and of the divine\r\nnature of the king, a witness for the divine claim of the sun to be\r\nworshipped, and of the right divine of the king to rule.\" Where is\r\nthere in all the world, in its most ancient cities, in its loneliest\r\ndeserts, any class of objects which has been held continuously sacred\r\nfor so long a time? The description of the sun itself by Ossian\r\napplies almost equally well to his worship as thus represented.\r\n\r\nObelisks as symbols of the sun and of the creative power of nature,\r\nwere not confined to Egypt. They belonged to the mythology of all\r\nancient nations. There are modifications of them in India, in\r\nprehistoric America, and among the archæological remains of our own\r\ncountry. They were common objects in connection with the Assyrian,\r\nPersian and Phoenician religions. And it has been conjectured with\r\nmuch plausibility that the image of gold, whose height was threescore\r\ncubits, and the breadth six, the usual proportions of an obelisk,\r\nwhich Nebuchadnezzar set up in the plain of Dura, in the province of\r\nBabylon, and commanded Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego to adore, was\r\nin reality an obelisk after the Egyptian pattern. Such an obelisk was\r\noften gilded, and was associated with the worship of the king as its\r\nmaterial purpose, and with the creation and origin of life as its\r\nsymbolic meaning. And if this was the case, there was an unusual\r\naggravation in this idolatry; for the Egyptian obelisks themselves\r\nwere never worshipped, but were always regarded as the signs of the\r\nhigher powers whose glory they expressed.\r\n\r\nThe question is naturally asked, Where were the obelisks originally\r\nplaced? At the present day we find those of them that remain in Egypt,\r\nsolitary objects without anything near them, and those that have been\r\ncarried to other lands have been set up in great open squares, or on\r\nriver embankments in the heart of the largest cities. Fortunately,\r\nthere is no doubt at all on this point. They stood in pairs at the\r\ndoors of the great temples, one on each side, where they served the\r\nsame purpose which the campanile of the Italian church or the spire of\r\na cathedral serves at the present day. Indeed, architects are of\r\nopinion that church towers and steeples are mere survivals of the old\r\nEgyptian obelisks, which furnished the original conception. The tower\r\ncorresponded to the shaft of the obelisk, and the steeple to the sharp\r\npyramidal part in which the summit of the obelisk terminated. And\r\nthough there is usually only one spire or tower now in connection with\r\nour churches, there used to be two, as many old examples still extant\r\ntestify, one standing on each side of the principal entrance after the\r\nmanner of the Egyptian obelisks. The slender round towers of Brechin\r\nand Abernethy, and of Devenish and other places in Ireland, capped by\r\na conical stone roof terminating in a single stone, which were for a\r\nlong time a puzzle to the antiquary, are now ascertained to be simply\r\nsteeples connected with Christian churches of the tenth and eleventh\r\ncenturies. And just as these towers are now left isolated and solitary\r\nwithout a trace of the buildings with which they were associated, so\r\nthe Egyptian temples have passed away, and the obelisks are left alone\r\nin the desert. But we can reconstruct in imagination the massive and\r\nlofty buildings in front of which they stood, and where they showed to\r\nthe greatest advantage. Instead of being dwarfed by the enormous\r\nmasses of the propylons, their height gained by the near comparison.\r\nThe obelisks in our squares and vast open spaces have their effect\r\ndestroyed by the buildings being at a distance from them. There is no\r\nscale near at hand to assist the eye in estimating the height;\r\nconsequently they seem much smaller than they really are. But when\r\nseen in the narrow precincts of a temple court, from whose floor they\r\nshot up into the blue sky overhead, surrounded by great columns and\r\nlofty gates, breaking the monotony of the heavy masses of masonry of\r\nwhich the Egyptian temples were composed, and acting the part which\r\ncampanili and spires perform in modern churches, a standard of\r\ncomparison was thus furnished which greatly enhanced their magnitude.\r\n\r\nNothing could be grander than the objects associated with the obelisks\r\nwhere they stood. The temple was approached by an avenue of huge\r\nsphinxes, in some cases a mile and a half long. Drawing nearer, the\r\nworshipper saw two lofty obelisks towering up a hundred feet in\r\nheight, on the right and left. Behind these he would observe with awe\r\nfour or six gigantic statues seated with their hands on their knees.\r\nAnd at the back of the statues he would gaze with astonishment upon\r\ntwo massive towers or pylons, broader at the base than at the summit,\r\ntwo hundred feet wide and a hundred and twenty feet high, crowned by a\r\ngigantic cornice, with their whole surface covered with coloured\r\nsculptures, representing one of the great dramas in the reign of a\r\nvictorious monarch. Above them would rise the tall masts of coloured\r\ncedar-wood, inserted in sinkings chased into the wall, surmounted by\r\nthe expanded banners of the king, or the heraldic bearings of the\r\ntemple floating in the breeze. Between the huge propylons opened up\r\nthe great gateway of the temple, sixty feet high, which led into a\r\nvast court, surrounded by columns and open to the sky. Beyond were\r\nwalls whose roofs were supported by a forest of enormous pillars,\r\nwhich seemed to have been raised by giants. Each hall diminished in\r\nsize, but increased in sacredness, until the inmost sanctuary was\r\nreached; small, dark, and awful in its obscurity. Here was the holy\r\nshrine in the shape of a boat or ark, having in it a kind of chest\r\npartially veiled, in which was hid the mystic symbol of the god. Like\r\nthe tabernacle of Israel, the common people were not allowed to go\r\nfarther than the outer court beyond the obelisks; only kings and\r\npriests being permitted to penetrate into the interior recesses, there\r\nto observe the ritual ceremonies of the mysterious Egyptian worship.\r\nOn the plan of the Egyptian temple were modelled the sacred buildings\r\nof the Jews; and the famous pillars of burnished brass, wonderful for\r\ntheir workmanship and their costly material, which Solomon erected in\r\nthe court of his temple, called Jachin and Boaz, had their prototypes\r\nin the obelisks of the Nile.\r\n\r\nThe obelisk belongs essentially to a level country; and there is no\r\nhabitable region in the world so uniformly flat and unbroken by any\r\nelevations or depressions of surface as the valley of the Nile. There\r\nit produces its greatest effect; its size is not dwarfed by\r\nsurrounding heights, and comes out by contrast with the small objects\r\nthat diversify the plain. It forms a conspicuous landmark, a salient\r\npoint on which the eye may rest with relief as it takes in the wide\r\nfeatureless horizon. In an artificial landscape, where there is no\r\nwild unmixed nature, where every inch of ground is cultivated, it is\r\nthe appropriate culmination of that triumph of human art which is\r\nvisible everywhere. It was a sense of this harmony of relation that\r\ninduced the builders of the great cathedrals and temples of the world\r\nto place them, not amid varied and rugged scenery, where they might be\r\nbrought into comparison with nature's work, but uniformly on level\r\nexpanses of land. There they form the crowning symbol of man's loving\r\ncare and painstaking endeavour, and give to the artificial landscape,\r\nwhich man has entirely subdued for his own uses, the finishing touch\r\nof power.\r\n\r\nObelisks are the most enduring monuments of antiquity, and yet no\r\nclass of objects has undergone such extraordinary vicissitudes. The\r\nhistory of the changes to which they have been subjected reads like a\r\nromance. At a remote age, not long after they were erected, most of\r\nthem were cast down during some political catastrophe, which shook the\r\nwhole country to its foundations. Under a subsequent dynasty the\r\nobelisks seem to have been lifted up to their former places, and\r\nregarded with the old veneration. After the lapse of nearly a thousand\r\nyears, the land was again convulsed by a terrible revolution, the\r\nnature of which is still wrapped up in almost impenetrable mystery. A\r\nwarlike migratory race came from the north-east, and subdued the\r\nwhole country. This is known as the Hyksos invasion, or the invasion\r\nof the Shepherd Kings, and produced the same effects in Egypt as the\r\nNorman invasion produced in England. Previous to this period the horse\r\nseemed to have been altogether unknown; but after this date it\r\nuniformly appears in Egyptian paintings and sculptures. The Hyksos\r\nmust therefore have been a pastoral race, in all likelihood belonging\r\nto the plains of Tartary; and, mounted on horses, they would find\r\nlittle difficulty in overcoming the foot soldiery of Egypt. When they\r\nhad obtained possession of the country, they burnt down the cities,\r\ndemolished the temples, and overthrew the obelisks. This disaster, the\r\nmost dreadful which Egypt had ever known, followed suddenly upon a\r\nperiod of extraordinary prosperity, when new cities were built, and\r\nold cities enlarged; works of great public utility were constructed, a\r\nmercantile intercourse established with the surrounding nations, and\r\nthe arts of painting, sculpture, and architecture, favoured by the\r\nlong peace and the abundant resources of the country, reached their\r\nhighest excellence. The reversal of all these signs of prosperity was\r\nso overwhelming, that the Egyptians of subsequent ages looked back\r\nupon this period of subjection under a foreign yoke which lay upon\r\nthem for five hundred years, with bitter resentment. When the hated\r\ndynasty was at an end, the Egyptians obliterated, as far as they\r\ncould, every sign of its supremacy, chiselled out the names of its\r\nkings on their monuments, and destroyed their records, so that few\r\ntraces of this revolution remain to dispel the strange mystery in\r\nwhich it is involved. They could never bear to hear the detested names\r\nof the Shepherd Kings; and this circumstance throws light upon the\r\npassage in Genesis which says that the occupation of a shepherd was an\r\nabomination to the Egyptians. Under the patronage of the new dynasty\r\nthe arts which had been destroyed were again restored, the monuments\r\nof the suppressed religion were freed from their indignities, and\r\nonce more reinstated with the old honours, and the whole country was\r\nreconstructed. But, while the temples were re-erected, and the old\r\nworship established with even greater splendour, there can be no doubt\r\nthat many of the earlier obelisks, owing to their smaller size, as\r\ncompared with the other gigantic monuments of Egypt, had been\r\ndestroyed past all reconstruction; and some of them remain in the land\r\nat the present day on the sites where, and in the exact manner in\r\nwhich, they were overturned by the Shepherd Kings.\r\n\r\nBut greater changes still happened to the Egyptian obelisks after\r\nthis. Previously they had been devastated and overturned on their own\r\nsoil. But now they excited the cupidity of the foreign invaders of\r\nEgypt, and were carried away to distant lands as trophies of their\r\nvictories. The first obelisks that were removed in this way were two\r\nof the principal ones that adorned one of the temples of Thebes. After\r\nthe capture of Thebes by Assurbanipal, the Assyrian king, the famous\r\nSardanapalus of the Greeks, they were transported to the conqueror's\r\npalace at Nineveh, and were afterwards lost for ever in the\r\ndestruction of that city, about sixty years later, or about six\r\nhundred years before Christ. The transportation of these enormous\r\nmasses of stone across the country to the seashore, down the Red Sea,\r\nover the Indian Ocean, up the Persian Gulf, and the river Tigris, to\r\ntheir destination in the palace of Nineveh, nearly two thousand miles,\r\nmust have been a feat of engineering skill at that early period of the\r\nworld's history, far more wonderful in regard to the difficulties\r\novercome, without any precedent to guide, and considering the rudeness\r\nof the means of transport, than anything that has ever been attempted\r\nsince in the same line. The example of the Assyrian tyrant was\r\nfollowed, after a long interval, by the Romans, who sought to magnify\r\nand commemorate their conquests in Egypt by spoiling the land of its\r\ncharacteristic monuments. The Cæsars, one after another, for more than\r\na hundred years, took advantage of their victories and the ruin of\r\nthe unhappy land of Egypt to convey its beautiful obelisks to their\r\nown capital to permanently adorn one or other of the various places of\r\npublic resort. They seem to have set almost the same high value upon\r\nthese singular monuments which their inventors did. Pliny and\r\nSuetonius describe the almost incredible magnitude of the vessels in\r\nwhich these gigantic masses of stone were conveyed to Ostia, the\r\nharbour town, and from thence up the Tiber to Rome. The huge triremes\r\nwere propelled by the force of hundreds of rowers across the waters of\r\nthe Mediterranean. From the quay at Rome they were dragged and pushed,\r\nby the brute force of thousands in the old Egyptian manner, on low\r\ncarts supported on rollers instead of wheels, to their destination,\r\nwhere they were set upright by a complicated machinery of ropes and\r\nhuge upright beams.\r\n\r\nHow many obelisks of Egyptian origin existed at one time in the world\r\nwe do not know. They were undoubtedly very numerous; but many of them\r\nwere broken up for building materials. The famous column called\r\nPompey's Pillar stands upon a fragment of an ancient obelisk; and\r\ntradition asserts that there are many similar fragments of greater or\r\nless antiquity under the ruins of the older houses of Alexandria. At\r\npresent forty-two obelisks are known to be in existence in different\r\nparts of the world. Of these, seventeen remain in Egypt on their\r\noriginal sites, of which no less than eleven are prostrate on the\r\nground, having been overturned by some political or religious\r\nrevolution, by the force of an earthquake, or by the slow undermining\r\nof the infiltrated waters of the Nile. No less than twelve of the\r\noldest and grandest are still to be seen standing erect in Rome, where\r\nthey constitute by far the most striking and memorable monuments. The\r\nothers are distributed in various places wide apart. One is in Paris,\r\ntwo are in Constantinople, a fourth, the famous Cleopatra's Needle, is\r\non the Thames Embankment, in the heart of London; a fifth, its old\r\ncompanion in Alexandria, is now in one of the public squares of New\r\nYork. And there are several diminutive ones, from eight feet in height\r\ndownwards, in the British Museum, in the Florentine Museum in\r\nFlorence, in Benevento in Italy, and in the town of Alnwick in\r\nNorthumberland.\r\n\r\nThe oldest of all the obelisks is the beautiful one of rosy granite\r\nwhich stands alone among the green fields on the banks of the Nile not\r\nfar from Cairo. It is the gravestone of a great ancient city which has\r\nvanished and left only this relic behind. That city was the\r\nBethshemesh of Scripture, the famous On, which is memorable to all\r\nBible readers as the residence of the priest Potipherah whose daughter\r\nAsenath Joseph married. The Greeks called it Heliopolis, the city of\r\nthe sun, because there the worship of the sun had its chief centre and\r\nits most sacred shrines. It was the seat of the most ancient\r\nuniversity in the world, to which youthful students came from all\r\nparts of the world, to learn the occult wisdom which the priests of On\r\nalone could teach. Thales, Solon, Eudoxus, Pythagoras, and Plato, all\r\nstudied there, perhaps Moses too. It was also the birthplace of the\r\nsacred literature of Egypt, where were written on papyrus leaves the\r\noriginal chapters of the oldest book in the world, generally known as\r\nthe \"Book of the Dead,\" giving a most striking account of the\r\nconflicts and triumphs of the life after death; a whole copy or\r\nfragment of which every Egyptian, rich or poor, wished to have buried\r\nwith him in his coffin, and portions of which are found inscribed on\r\nevery mummy case and on the walls of every tomb. In front of one of\r\nthe principal temples of the sun, in this magnificent city, stood\r\nalong with a companion, long since destroyed, the solitary obelisk\r\nwhich we now behold on the spot. It alone, as I have said, has\r\nsurvived the wreck of all the glory of the place, as if to assure us\r\nthat what is given to God, however ignorantly and superstitiously,\r\nendures, while all the other works of man perish. It was constructed\r\nby Usirtesen I., who is supposed to have reigned two thousand eight\r\nhundred years before Christ, and has outlasted all the dynastic\r\nchanges of the land, and still stands where it originally stood nearly\r\nforty-seven centuries ago. What appears of its shaft above ground is\r\nsixty-eight feet in height, but its base is buried in the mud of the\r\nNile; and year after year the inundation of the river deposits its\r\nfilm of soil around its foot, and buries it still deeper in its sacred\r\ngrave. Down the centre of each of its four faces runs a line of\r\ndeeply-cut hieroglyphics, in whose cavities the wild mason-bees\r\nconstruct their mud-cells and store their honey. Nothing can exceed\r\nthe beauty and distinctness of these carvings. The pictures of birds\r\nand beasts, chiselled in the hard polished granite, have a purity of\r\nform and line, a directness of expression and intention, which is most\r\nimpressive. Its top is somewhat damaged, having been originally\r\nprotected, as was the case with many of the obelisks which were not\r\nfinely finished to a point, with a capping of gilded bronze that\r\nremained intact till the thirteen century. The inscription on its\r\nsides contains nothing of historic value. It is simply a dedication to\r\nUsirtesen, who constructed it, under the title of Horus, or the rising\r\nsun, which was borne, as I have said, by the kings of Egypt on account\r\nof their supposed origin as an incarnation of the sun.\r\n\r\nAt Luxor, a single obelisk, the property of the English, still\r\nmaintains its ancient position. It is very beautiful, formed of red\r\ngranite, and covered with elegantly carved inscriptions, running up\r\neach of the four faces. The hieroglyphics are cut to an unusual depth,\r\nand are remarkably clear and well-formed, indicating that the monument\r\nwas raised in honour of Rameses the Great, the most illustrious of all\r\nthe Egyptian monarchs, and the most magnificent and prolific architect\r\nthe world has ever seen. The top of the obelisk was originally left in\r\na rough unfinished state, the roughness having been concealed by a\r\ncapping of bronze; but this having been removed long ago, the surface\r\nhas become very much eroded by exposure, which somewhat detracts from\r\nthe elegance of the shaft. It has also the peculiarity that its two\r\ninner faces are sensibly curved--a peculiarity which it is supposed\r\nwas designed to make the sunlight fall with softer effect, so as to\r\nmake the shadows less crude, and the angles less sharp. The shaft,\r\nwhich is eighty-two feet high by eight feet in diameter at the base,\r\nis elevated upon a pedestal, which is adorned by statues in high\r\nrelief of dog-headed monkeys standing in an attitude of adoration at\r\nthe corners worshipping the sun, and also by standing figures of the\r\ngod of the Nile presenting offerings, incised in the stone like the\r\nhieroglyphics of the shaft. The surroundings of this obelisk are far\r\ngrander than those of any other obelisk in the world. At present the\r\nextent and dimensions of the ruins of Thebes produce an overwhelming\r\neffect upon the visitor. But it is almost impossible for us to imagine\r\nits magnificence when its temples and obelisks were in their full\r\nperfection, and the great Rameses was carried on the shoulders of his\r\nofficers through the ranks of adoring slaves to behold the completion\r\nof the works which had been designed to perpetuate his glory. The\r\nancient city, divided in the middle by the Nile, as London is by the\r\nThames or Glasgow by the Clyde, covered the vast plain, with great\r\nhouses in the outskirts standing in richly cultivated gardens, each\r\ntemple surrounded by its own little sacred lake, over which the bodies\r\nof the dead were carried by the priests before burial, and the\r\nbeautiful Mokattam Hills bounding the view, wearing the soft lilac hue\r\nof distance. Only two or three places on earth can rival the\r\noverwhelming interest which the city possesses. But the colossal\r\nassociated temples of Karnac and Luxor are absolutely unique. There is\r\nnothing on earth to equal them. They are man's greatest achievements\r\nin religious architecture. Long rows of stupendous pillars, covered\r\nfrom base to top with coloured pictures and hieroglyphics, containing\r\na whole library of actually written and pictured history and\r\nreligion, look \"like a Brobdingnagian forest turned into stone,\" in\r\nthe midst of which the visitor feels himself an insignificant insect.\r\nA sense of superhuman awfulness, of personal nothingness and\r\nirresistible power, is what these stupendous structures inspire in\r\neven the most callous spectator. A confused mass of broken columns and\r\nheaps of huge sculptured stones present an appearance as if the old\r\ngiants had been at war on the spot, hurling rocks at each other.\r\nBetween Luxor and Karnac extended an avenue of sphinxes, two miles\r\nlong, numbering more than four thousand pieces of sculpture, now\r\nrepresented by mutilated formless blocks of stone. We see in these\r\nvast temples, which were raised by a people inspired with the\r\nsentiment that they were the greatest of all nations, to be the chief\r\nshrines of the religion of the country, the fruits of the plunder and\r\nthe tribute of Asia and Africa. The funds necessary to build them had\r\nbeen procured by robbing other nations; and most of the work was done\r\nby captives taken in war. Many a fair province had been desolated of\r\nits inhabitants, many a splendid city spoiled of its riches, in order\r\nto construct these awful halls. Unfortunately, the annual overflow of\r\nthe inundation of the Nile covers the ground to the depth of a foot or\r\ntwo, staining and eating away the bases of the columns, and\r\noverthrowing their enormous drums and architraves. The destruction\r\ncannot be prevented, for the water infiltrates through the soil; and\r\nsome day, ere long, the remaining columns will be hurled down, and the\r\npride of Karnac will lie prone in the dust.\r\n\r\nPassing westward to Rome, the largest obelisk not only in the Eternal\r\nCity but in the whole world is that which now adorns the square of St.\r\nJohn Lateran. It is, as usual, of red granite much darkened and\r\ncorroded by time, and stands with its pedestal and cross one hundred\r\nand forty-one feet high; the shaft alone being one hundred and eight\r\nfeet seven inches in height, with faces about nine feet and a half\r\nwide at the base; the whole mass weighing upwards of four hundred and\r\nsixty tons. It was found among the ruins of the Circus Maximus broken\r\ninto three pieces, and was dug up by order of Pope Sixtus V., conveyed\r\nto its present site, and re-erected by the celebrated architect\r\nFontana in 1588. The lower end had been so much injured by its fall,\r\nthat in order to enable it to stand, it was found necessary to cut off\r\nabout two feet and a half to obtain a level base. On the top of it\r\nFontana added by way of ornament four bronze lions, surmounted by\r\nthree mountain peaks, out of which sprung the cross, as the armorial\r\nbearings of the Popes. Thus crowned with the cross, and consecrated to\r\nthe honour of Christianity, this noble relic of antiquity acquires an\r\nadditional interest from its nearness to the great Basilica of the\r\nLateran, which is the representative cathedral of the Papacy and the\r\nmother church of Christendom, and to the Lateran Palace, for a\r\nthousand years the residence of the Popes of Rome.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Lateran obelisk is unusually varied. It was\r\noriginally constructed by Thothmes III., and set up by him before the\r\ngreat temple of Amen at Heliopolis. But being an old man at the time,\r\nhe left his successor to complete it by adding most of the\r\nhieroglyphics. It took thirty-six years to carve these sculptures; the\r\nfour sides from top to bottom being covered with inscriptions in the\r\npurest style of Egyptian art. From one of these inscriptions we learn\r\nthat the obelisk was thrown down in Egypt probably during the invasion\r\nof the Shepherd Kings, and was re-erected by the great Rameses, who\r\ndid not, contrary to the usual custom, arrogate to himself the honours\r\nof his predecessor. These sculptures tell us of monarchs who had\r\nreigned, and conquered, and died long before the mythic times, when\r\nthe \"pious Æneas,\" as Virgil tells us, landed on the Italian shore,\r\nand Romulus ploughed his significant furrow round the Palatine Hill. A\r\nthousand years before the foundation of Rome, and two thousand years\r\nbefore the Christian era, it had been excavated from the quarries of\r\nSyene and worshipped at Heliopolis. It was as old to the Cæsars as the\r\ndays of the Cæsars are to us. Pliny tells us that the work of\r\nquarrying, conveying, and setting it up employed twenty thousand men;\r\nand there is a dim tradition that so anxious was the king for its\r\nsafety, when it was erected, that in order to ensure this he bound his\r\nown son to the top of it. A close examination of the hieroglyphics\r\nreveals the curious fact that the name of the god Amen wherever it\r\noccurs, is more deeply carved than the other figures, in order to\r\nobliterate the name of some other deity which had previously occupied\r\nits place. It is supposed that this circumstance indicates a\r\ntheological revolution which happened in the history of Egypt when\r\nAmenhotep III., the Memnon of the Greek historian, married an Arabian\r\nwife of the name of Taia, who introduced her own religion into her\r\nadopted country, as Jezebel, the wife of Ahab, introduced the worship\r\nof Baal into Israel. When this dynasty was overthrown, in the course\r\nof about fifty years, the old faith was restored, and the names of the\r\nold gods substituted for those which had usurped their place on the\r\nreligious monuments. It is supposed that the Lateran obelisk was the\r\none before which Cambyses, the great Persian conqueror, stood lost in\r\nadmiration, arrested in his semi-religious course of destroying the\r\npopular monuments of Egypt. Augustus intended to have removed it to\r\nRome, but was deterred by the difficulty of the undertaking, and also\r\nby superstitious scruples, because it had been specially dedicated to\r\nthe sun, and fixed immovably in his temple. Constantine the Great had\r\nno such scruples, believing, as he said, that \"he did no injury to\r\nreligion if he removed a wonder from one temple, and again consecrated\r\nit in Rome, the temple of the whole world.\" He died, however, before\r\nhe had completed his design, having succeeded only in transporting the\r\nobelisk to Alexandria, from whence his son and successor Constantius\r\ntransferred it to Rome, and placed it on the Spina of the Great\r\nCircus. So clumsily, however, was it erected in this place, that\r\nseveral deep holes had to be drilled in the upper part of it, in order\r\nthat ropes for hauling it up might be put through them; a defect in\r\nengineering skill which has disfigured the obelisk, and contrasts\r\nstrikingly with the resources of the ancient Egyptians, who were able\r\nto raise the stone to its position without such a device. The obelisk\r\nis thus an enduring monument of three great rulers--Thothmes, who\r\nfirst constructed it in Heliopolis; Constantine, who removed it to\r\nRome; and Pope Sixtus V., who conveyed it from the Circus Maximus, and\r\nre-erected it where it now stands.\r\n\r\nNext in point of height to the Lateran obelisk is the one that stands\r\nin the great square of St. Peter's, between two beautiful fountains\r\nthat are continually showering high in the air their radiant sunlit\r\nspray. It is meant to serve as the gnomon of a gigantic dial, traced\r\nin lines of white marble in the pavement of the square. Its rosy\r\nsurface glistening in the rays of the sun, and its long shadow cast\r\nbefore it on the ground, make it a very impressive object. Its origin\r\nis involved in mystery, for there is no inscription on it to tell who\r\nerected it, or where it came from. This absence of hieroglyphics\r\npoints to its having been an unfinished work--something having\r\nprevented its constructor from recording on it the purpose of its\r\nerection, as was usually the case. But as the vacant shadow of the\r\ndial and the blank empty lines of the spectrum are more suggestive\r\nthan any sunlit spaces, so the blank unwritten sides of this obelisk\r\ngive rise to more speculations than if they had been carved from head\r\nto foot with hieroglyphics. On account of this peculiarity, some\r\nauthors have not hesitated to consider it a mere imitation obelisk,\r\nconstructed by the Romans at a comparatively late period. This idea,\r\nhowever, is refuted by the evidence of Pliny, who regarded it as a\r\ngenuine Egyptian relic, and tells us that it was cut from the quarry\r\nof Syene, and dedicated to the sun by the son of Sesores, in\r\nobedience to an oracle, after his recovery from blindness. It is\r\ngenerally believed that it first stood before one of the temples of\r\nHeliopolis, was then removed to Alexandria, and finally transported to\r\nRome by Caligula. This emperor constructed a special vessel for the\r\npurpose, of greater dimensions than had ever been seen before; and\r\nafter it had brought the obelisk to the banks of the Tiber, he\r\ncommanded it to be filled with stones, and sunk as a caisson in the\r\nharbour of Ostia, which he was constructing at the time. On arriving\r\nat Rome the obelisk was set up on the Spina of the Circus of Nero,\r\nwhich is now occupied by the sacristy of St. Peter's Church. For\r\nfifteen centuries the obelisk remained undisturbed on its site, the\r\nonly one in the city that escaped being overthrown. At last its\r\nfoundation giving way, so that it leaned dangerously towards the old\r\nBasilica of St. Peter's, Sixtus V. formed the design of removing it to\r\nwhere it now stands, a very short distance from the original spot. The\r\nrecord of its re-erection, the first in papal Rome, by Fontana--a work\r\nof extreme difficulty and imposing ceremonial magnificence, which was\r\nrichly rewarded by the grateful Pope--is exceedingly interesting. A\r\ncurious legend is usually related in connection with it. A papal edict\r\nwas proclaimed threatening death to any one who should utter a loud\r\nword while the operation of lifting and settling the obelisk was going\r\non. As the \"huge crystallisation of Egyptian sweat\" rose on its basis\r\nthere was a sudden stoppage, the hempen cables refused to do their\r\nwork, and the hanging mass of stone threatened to fall and destroy\r\nitself. Suddenly from out the breathless crowd rose a loud, clear\r\nvoice, \"Wet the ropes.\" There was inspiration in the suggestion; the\r\narchitect acted upon it, and the obelisk at once took its stand on its\r\nbase, where it has firmly remained ever since. Not only was the sailor\r\nBresca pardoned for transgressing the papal command, but he was\r\nrewarded, and the district of Bordighera, from which he came, received\r\nthe privilege of supplying the palm leaves for the use of Rome on\r\nPalm Sunday--a privilege which it still possesses, and which forms the\r\nprincipal trade of the place.\r\n\r\nTo me the most familiar and interesting of all the Roman obelisks is\r\nthat which stands in the centre of the Piazza del Popolo, the finest\r\nand largest square in Rome. It is about eighty feet high, carved with\r\nhieroglyphics, with four marble Egyptian lions, one at each corner of\r\nthe platform on which it stands, pouring from their mouths copious\r\nstreams of water into large basins, with a refreshing sound. Lions in\r\nEgypt were regarded as symbols of the sun when passing through the\r\nzodiacal sign of Leo, the time when the annual inundation of the Nile\r\noccurred. They had thus a deep significance in connection with water.\r\nThe obelisk was originally erected in front of the Temple of the Sun\r\nat Heliopolis, by the great Rameses, the Sesostris of the Greeks,\r\nwhose personal character and wide conquests fill a larger space in the\r\nhistory of ancient Egypt than those of any other monarch. From\r\nHeliopolis it was removed to Rome, after the battle of Actium, by\r\nAugustus, and placed on the Spina of the Circus Maximus, the sports of\r\nwhich were under the special protection of Apollo, the sun-god, by\r\nwhose favour it was supposed that the Egyptian victory had been\r\nachieved. For four hundred years it acted as a gnomon, regulating by\r\nthe length and direction of its shadow the hours of the public games\r\nof the circus; and then it was overturned during those troublous days\r\nin which the empire was rent asunder. Twelve centuries of decay and\r\nwreck had buried it from the eyes of men, until it was dug up and\r\nplaced where it now stands, in 1587, by Pope Sixtus V., to whom modern\r\nRome is indebted for the restoration of many of her ancient monuments,\r\nand the construction of many of her public buildings and streets. With\r\nthe cross planted on its summit, this noble monument was long the\r\nfirst object which met the traveller's eye as he entered Rome from the\r\nnorth by the old Flaminian way. Brought to commemorate the overthrow\r\nof the land from whence it came, it has witnessed the overthrow of the\r\nconquerors in turn; and now re-erected in the modern capital, it will\r\nendure when its glory too has passed away. And out of the ruins of the\r\ncity of the Popes, as out of the ruins of the city of the Cæsars, some\r\nfuture architect will dig it up to grace the triumph of a brighter and\r\nfreer resuscitation of the Eternal City than the world has yet seen.\r\n\r\nThe association of fountains at its base with this obelisk seems at\r\nfirst sight as incongruous as the crowning of its apex with a metal\r\ncross, for the Christian emblem can never alter the nature of the\r\npagan monument. There is no natural harmony in the association, for\r\nthere are no fountains or streams of running water in the desert. The\r\nobelisk belongs essentially to the dry and parched east; the fountain\r\nis the birth of the happier west, bright with the sparkle and musical\r\nwith the sound of many waters. The obelisk relieves the monotony of\r\nimmeasurable plains over which a sky of serene unstained blue arches\r\nitself in infinite altitude, the image of eternal purity, and the sun\r\nrises day after day with the same unsullied brilliance, and sets with\r\nthe same unmitigable glory. The fountain, on the other hand, is the\r\nchild of lands whose mountains kiss the clouds and gleam with the\r\npurity of everlasting snows, and where each day brings out new\r\nbeauties, and each season reveals a fresh and ever-varying charm. But\r\nalthough there is no geographical reason why these two objects should\r\nbe associated, there is a poetical fitness. The obelisk is the symbol\r\nof the perpetual past, holding in its changeless unity, as on its\r\ncarved sides, the memories of former ages; the fountain is the symbol\r\nof the perpetual present, ever changing, ever new. The one speaks to\r\nus of a petrified old age; the other of an immortal youth. And thus it\r\nis in life, each passing moment flowing on with all its changes beside\r\nthe stern, hard, enduring monument of the irrevocable past on which\r\nwhat is written is changelessly written. How different too are the\r\nbright sparkling fountains that leap with ever-varying beauty at the\r\nfoot of the Flaminian obelisk now, from the dull, sleepy monotonous\r\nriver that, like a Lethe flood, flowed past it in the old days at\r\nHeliopolis! Are they not both symbolical of the new and the old world,\r\nof the Christian faith, with its progressive thought and varied\r\nexpanding life, and the stagnant pagan creed, which impressed the soul\r\nwith the sense of human helplessness in the face of an unchangeable\r\niron order alike of nature and of society?\r\n\r\nAnother of the great obelisks of Rome is that which stands on Monte\r\nCitorio, in front of the present Parliament House. It was brought to\r\nRome by Augustus, who dedicated it anew to the sun, and placed it as\r\nthe gnomon of a meridian in the midst of the Campus Martius.\r\nOriginally it had been erected at Heliopolis in honour of Psammeticus\r\nI., who reigned about seven hundred years before Christ. This monarch\r\nlived during a time when the national religion had become corrupted,\r\nand the whole land had come under the influence of Greek thought and\r\nGreek customs. But the obelisk which he erected is worthy of the best\r\nperiod of Egyptian art. It is universally admired for the remarkable\r\nbeauty of its hieroglyphics. The anonymous pilgrim of Einsiedlen\r\nmentions that this obelisk was still erect when he visited Rome about\r\nthe beginning of the ninth century. It seems, however, to have fallen\r\nand to have been broken in pieces, nearly three hundred years later,\r\nduring the terrible conflagration caused by the Norman troops of\r\nRobert Guiscard. Several fragments of it were dug up, one after\r\nanother, during the sixteenth century. The principal part of the shaft\r\nwas discovered in 1748, among the ruins beneath the choir of the\r\nChurch of San Lorenzo in Lucina. These portions were damaged in such a\r\nway as to show clearly the action of fire, proving that the obelisk\r\nhad been destroyed in the great fire of 1084. Pope Pius VI. gathered\r\ntogether the fragments, and with the aid of granite pieces taken from\r\nthe ruined column of Antoninus Pius, which stood in the neighbourhood,\r\nhe formed of these a whole shaft, which represents, as nearly as\r\npossible, the original obelisk. It is seventy-two feet high, and is\r\nsurmounted by a globe and a small pyramid of bronze, which, along with\r\nits pedestal, increases its height to one hundred and thirty-four\r\nfeet. A portion of the lines of the celebrated sun-dial, whose gnomon\r\nit formed, was brought to light under the sacristy of San Lorenzo in\r\nLucina in 1463.\r\n\r\nAll the other obelisks in Rome belong to comparatively recent periods,\r\nto the decadence of Egypt. None of them are of any great significance\r\nto the student of archæology. Several of them were executed in Egypt\r\nby order of the Roman emperors, and are therefore not genuine but\r\nimitation obelisks. Of this kind may be mentioned the Esquiline and\r\nQuirinal obelisks, which were brought to Rome by the emperor Claudius,\r\nand placed in the old Egyptian manner, one on each side of the\r\nentrance to the great mausoleum of Augustus in the Campus Martius.\r\nThey are both destitute of hieroglyphics and are broken into several\r\npieces. One now stands on Monte Cavallo, in front of the great\r\nQuirinal Palace, betwixt the two well-known gigantic groups of men and\r\nhorses, statues of Greek origin, supposed to be those of Castor and\r\nPollux, executed by Pheidias and Praxiteles; and the other in the\r\nlarge open space in front of the great Basilica of Santa Maria\r\nMaggiore. Another of these bastard obelisks occupies a commanding\r\nposition at the top of the Spanish Stairs, in front of the Church of\r\nTrinita dei Monti. It stood originally on the spina of the circus of\r\nSallust, in his gardens, and is covered with hieroglyphics of the\r\nrudest workmanship, which sufficiently proclaim their origin, as a\r\nRoman forgery probably of the period of the Antonine emperors. In the\r\nmidst of the public gardens, on the Pincian Hill, there is another\r\nRoman obelisk about thirty feet high, excavated from the quarries of\r\nSyene, and set up by Hadrian originally at Antinopolis in Egypt in\r\nfront of a temple dedicated to the deified Antinous, the lamented\r\nfavourite of the emperor. It was afterwards transferred to the\r\nimperial villa at Tivoli, near Rome, and subsequently to the grounds\r\nof the Church of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme, from whence it was\r\nfinally taken to its present site. This obelisk has a special interest\r\nbecause it commemorates one of the most beautiful and touching\r\nexamples of self-sacrifice which the annals of paganism afford. We are\r\napt to judge of Antinous from the languid beauty of the statue of him\r\nin the Roman galleries, as simply the pampered sycophant of a court.\r\nBut behind his sensual beauty and softness there was an unselfish\r\ndevotion which the caresses of royalty and the favours of fortune\r\ncould not spoil. When the oracle declared that the happiness of\r\nHadrian, who was afflicted with a profound melancholy, could only be\r\nsecured by the sacrifice of what was most dear to him, Antinous went\r\nat once and drowned himself in the Nile, and thus gave his life for\r\nhis imperial friend, who, instead of being made better by the\r\nsacrifice, was left altogether inconsolable. The magnificent city\r\nfounded to perpetuate his memory is now a heap of ruined mounds, and\r\nthe obelisk that bore his name in Egypt now stands far away in Rome;\r\nbut time cannot quench the glow of sympathy that kindles in the heart\r\nof every one who remembers his story of noble self-sacrificing love.\r\n\r\nThere are three or four obelisks that mark the introduction of the\r\nEgyptian worship of Isis into the imperial city of the later emperors.\r\nAt one time everything Egyptian was fashionable in Rome, and the\r\ngoddess of Egypt was domesticated in the Roman Pantheon, and temples\r\nin her honour were erected in several parts of the city and throughout\r\nthe empire. Obelisks, fashioned in Egypt by command of the Romans,\r\nwere often placed in front of the temples. But these spurious obelisks\r\nhave little dignity or significance, and suffer wofully when brought\r\ninto comparison with specimens of the genuine work of old Egypt. The\r\nlargest and most imposing of these monuments of the new faith of the\r\ncity is the one that now stands in the Piazza Navona, formerly called\r\nthe Pamphilian Obelisk, in honour of the family name of Pope Innocent\r\nX., who placed it there. It is forty feet high, of red granite, broken\r\ninto five pieces, and covered with hieroglyphics, the whole style and\r\nexecution of which are so inferior that Winkelman long ago, although\r\nhe knew nothing of their import, detected the fact of the obelisk\r\nbeing a mere imitation. It was cut and engraved at Syene by order of\r\nthe emperor Domitian, who designed it to adorn his villa on the Lake\r\nof Albano. From thence it was removed by the usurper Maxentius to the\r\ncircus on the Appian Way, founded by him, and named after his son\r\nRomulus. It is now on the site of the old Circus Agonalis, whose form\r\nand boundaries are marked out by the houses of the Piazza Navona.\r\nSurmounted by the Pope's device of a dove with an olive branch, a vain\r\nsubstitute of heraldry for sacred symbolism, and standing on an\r\nartificial rock-work about forty feet high, composed of figures of\r\nTritons and nymphs, disporting themselves amid plashing fountains and\r\nmarble foliage, the whole subject is incongruous and utterly opposed\r\nto the simplicity and majesty of the ancient monuments.\r\n\r\nNear the Pantheon there is a pair of obelisks which were brought from\r\nthe East, and stood together before the temple of Isis and Serapis,\r\nwhich is supposed to have been situated on the site of the Dominican\r\nChurch of Santa Maria Sopra Minerva. They were found when digging the\r\nfoundations of the church in 1667, along with an altar of Isis, now in\r\nthe Capitoline Museum. One of these obelisks was erected by Clement\r\nXI. in 1711, in front of the Pantheon, in the midst of the fountain of\r\nthe Piazza. Its height is only about seventeen feet, and the\r\nhieroglyphics on it indicate that it was constructed by Psammeticus\r\nII., the supposed Hophra of Hebrew history. This same monarch also\r\nconstructed its twin-fellow which now stands in the Piazza Minerva in\r\nthe near neighbourhood. The celebrated sculptor Bernini, when\r\nre-erecting it at the command of Pope Alexander VII. in 1660, had the\r\nexceedingly bad taste to balance it on the back of a marble elephant,\r\nthe work of his pupil Ferrata; on account of which absurd incongruity\r\nBernini received from the satirical Roman populace the nickname of\r\n\"The Elephant.\" Only one obelisk in Rome was not restored or\r\nre-erected by any Pope, viz. that which stands in the beautiful\r\ngrounds of the Villa Mattei in the Coelian Hill. It was found near the\r\nCapitol on the site of an ancient temple of Isis, and was presented by\r\nthe magistrates to the owner of the villa, a great collector of\r\nantiquities. It is said that when it was raised in 1563, on its red\r\ngranite pedestal, the mason who superintended the work incautiously\r\nrested his hand on the block, when the shaft suddenly slid down and\r\ncrushed it, the bones of the imprisoned member being still held\r\nbetween the two stones.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing were the last obelisks erected in Rome by the emperors.\r\nAfter them no more were constructed either in the imperial city or in\r\ntheir native land of Egypt. The language inscribed upon them had come\r\nto be superseded by the universal use of the Greek tongue; there was\r\nno use therefore in making monuments for the reception of hieroglyphic\r\nrecords which nobody could understand or interpret. The sudden craze\r\nfor the Egyptian idolatry passed away as suddenly as it sprang up, and\r\nChristianity established itself as the religion of the civilised\r\nworld. The temples in Egypt and Rome were closed, the altars\r\noverthrown, and the objects connected with the material symbolism of\r\npaganism were destroyed, and objects connected with the spiritual\r\nsymbolism of Christianity set up in their place. And thus the obelisk,\r\nthe oldest of all religious symbols, which was constructed at the very\r\ndawn of human existence, to mark the worship of the material luminary,\r\nfell into disuse and oblivion, when \"the Sun of Righteousness\" rose\r\nabove the horizon of the world, with healing in His wings, dispelling\r\nall the mists and delusions of error. The art of constructing obelisks\r\nfollowed the usual stages in the history of all human art. Its best\r\nperiod was that which indicated the greatest faith; its worst that\r\nwhich marked the decay of faith. The oldest specimens are invariably\r\nthe most perfect and beautiful; the most recent exhibit too marked\r\nsigns of the decrepitude of skill that had come over their makers.\r\nBetween the oldest specimens and their surroundings there was a\r\nharmony and an appropriateness which solemnised the scene and excited\r\nfeelings of adoration and awe. Between the latest specimens and their\r\nsurroundings there was an incongruity which proved them to be aliens\r\nand strangers on the scene, and was fatal to all reverence; an\r\nincongruity which the modern Romans have only intensified by raising\r\nthem on pedestals of most uncongenial forms, and crowning them with\r\nhideous masses of metal, representing the insignia of popes or other\r\nobjects equally unsuitable. We see in the oldest obelisks a wonderful\r\nease and an exquisite finish of execution, a maturity of thought and\r\nskill which none of the later obelisks reached, and which indicate the\r\nhigh-water mark of man's achievement in that line. There is also \"a\r\nbloom of youth and of the earth's morning\" about them which is quite\r\nindescribable, and which doubtless came to them because of the power\r\nand reality of faith. They were the fresh natural originals in which a\r\ndeep primitive spontaneous adoration that dominated the whole nature\r\nof man expressed itself; while the specimens that were executed\r\nafterwards were slavish imitations, expressing a worship and a creed\r\nwhich had become fixed and formal.\r\n\r\nOne of the most valuable results of the expedition of the great\r\nNapoleon to Egypt, ostensibly for scientific and antiquarian purposes,\r\nbut really for military glory, was the acquisition of the Rosetta\r\nstone now in the British Museum--which afforded the key to the\r\ndecipherment of the Egyptian hieroglyphics--and of the obelisk of\r\nLuxor which now adorns the noble Place de la Concord in Paris. The\r\nhistory of the engineering difficulties overcome in bringing this\r\nobelisk to France is extremely interesting. Indeed, the story of the\r\ntransportation of the obelisks from their native home, from time to\r\ntime, to other lands, is no less romantic and worthy of study than the\r\nartistic, religious, or antiquarian phases of the subject. It forms a\r\nspecial literature of its own to which Commander Gorringe of the\r\nUnited States Navy, in his elaborate and magnificent work on Egyptian\r\nobelisks, has done the amplest justice. It cost upwards of £100,000 to\r\nbring the Luxor Obelisk to Paris, owing to the inexperience of the\r\nengineers and the imperfection of their method. But it was worthy of\r\nthis vast expenditure of toil and money; for standing in an open\r\ncircus unimpeded by narrow streets, and unspoiled by the tawdry\r\nornaments which disfigure the Roman obelisks, it adds to the\r\nmagnificent modern city the charm of antique majesty. It stands\r\nseventy-six feet and a half in height, with its apex left rough and\r\nunfinished, destitute of the gilded cap which formerly completed and\r\nprotected it. Each of its four sides contains three vertical lines of\r\nwell-executed hieroglyphics, which show that it was raised in honour\r\nof Rameses II., to adorn the stupendous temple of Luxor at Thebes\r\nwhich he constructed. When it lay on its original site, previous to\r\nits being transported, it was found to have been cracked at the time\r\nof its first erection, and repaired by means of two dove-tailed wedges\r\nof wood which had perished long ago. But this defect is not now\r\nnoticeable. The companion of this obelisk is still standing at Luxor,\r\nand has already been described. Both of them show a peculiarity in\r\ntheir lines, which could only be noticed effectually when the pair\r\nstood together. This peculiarity is a convexity, or _entasis_, as it\r\nis called, on the inner faces. Even to the untrained eye its sides\r\nseem not of equal dimensions; and actual measurement shows the\r\nirregularity more clearly. This is said, however, to be exceptional to\r\nthe general rule, and to be foreign to the design of an obelisk in the\r\nbest period of the Pharaonic art. Still, several magnificent\r\nspecimens, such as the Luxor and Flaminian obelisks, exhibit it. And\r\nthey are an illustration of what was a marked characteristic of all\r\nclassic architecture, which shows a slight curvature or entasis in its\r\nlong lines.\r\n\r\nIt was early found out that mathematical exactness and beauty were not\r\nthe same. By making its two sides geometrically equal, the living\r\nexpression of the most beautiful marble statue is destroyed, and it\r\nbecomes simply a piece of architecture. It is well known that the two\r\nsides of the human face are not precisely the same; the irregularity\r\nof the one modifies the irregularity of the other, and thus a higher\r\nsymmetry and harmony is the result. The two sides of the leaf of the\r\nbegonia are unequal, and if folded together will not correspond. The\r\nsame is true of the leaf of the elm and the lime. But when the mass of\r\nthe foliage is seen together, this irregularity gives an added charm\r\nto the whole. Every object in nature has some imperfection, which\r\nindicates that it has a relation to some other object, and is but a\r\npart of a greater whole. The intentional irregularity of the windows\r\nin the Doge's Palace at Venice enhances the effect of the marvellous\r\nfaçade. By comparing the Parthenon at Athens, with its curves and\r\ninclinations, with the Madeleine at Paris, we see how far short the\r\ncopy comes of the original in beauty and expressiveness, because of\r\nthe exact formality of its right angles. The ancient Egyptians\r\nunderstood this well; and in their architecture they sought to rise to\r\na higher symmetry through irregularity; and we can see in their\r\nfrequent departure from upright and parallel lines in the construction\r\nof their temples, an effort to escape from formal exactness, and a\r\nlonging for the nobler unity which is realised to the full in the rich\r\nvariety of the Gothic. We may be sure that \"every attempt in art that\r\nseeks a theoretical completeness, in so doing sinks from the natural\r\ninto the artificial, from the living and the divine into the\r\nmechanical and commonplace.\" The Egyptian obelisk is thus but a type\r\nof a great law of nature. In this simplest and most primitive specimen\r\nof architecture we have an illustration of the principle which gives\r\nits expressiveness to the human face, beauty to the flowers of the\r\nfield, and grandeur to the highest triumphs of human art.\r\n\r\nThe obelisks that remain to be described are the two which to us are\r\nthe most interesting; the pair of \"Cleopatra's Needles\" which so long\r\nstood side by side at Alexandria, and are now separated by the\r\nAtlantic Ocean; one standing on the Thames Embankment in London, and\r\nthe other in Central Park, New York. They were both set up in front of\r\nthe great temple of the Sun at Heliopolis, about fifteen centuries\r\nbefore Christ, by Thothmes III., and engraved by Rameses II., the two\r\nmightiest of the kings of Egypt. After standing on their original site\r\nfor fourteen centuries, witnessing the rise and fall of many native\r\ndynasties, and the establishment of the Greek dominion under the\r\nPtolemies, they were, when Egypt became a province of Imperial Rome,\r\ntransferred by Cæsar Augustus to Alexandria. There they adorned the\r\nCæsareum or palace of the Cæsars, which stood by the side of the\r\nharbour, was surrounded with a sacred grove, and was the greatest\r\nbuilding in the city. What Thebes and Heliopolis were in the time of\r\nthe Pharaohs, Alexandria became in the time of the Ptolemies. And\r\nthough, being a parasitical growth, it could not originate works of\r\ngenius, like its ancient prototypes, it could appropriate those which\r\nHeliopolis and Thebes had created. The tragic death of Cleopatra, the\r\nlast of the dynasty of the Ptolemies, had taken place seven years\r\nbefore the setting up of these obelisks at Alexandria; so that she had\r\nin reality nothing to do with them personally. For about fifteen\r\ncenturies the two obelisks stood in their new position before the\r\nCæsareum. They saw the gradual overthrow, by time's resistless hand,\r\nof the magnificent palace which they adorned; and they themselves felt\r\nthe slow undermining of the sea as it encroached upon the land, until\r\nat last one of them fell to the ground about three hundred years ago,\r\nand got partially covered over with sand, leaving the other to stand\r\nalone. Then came the French invasion of Egypt, and the victories of\r\nNelson and Abercromby, when Mahomet Ali, the ruler of the land,\r\noffered the prostrate obelisk to the British nation as a token of\r\ngratitude. The offer, however, was not taken advantage of, for various\r\nreasons. At last the patriotism and enterprise of a private\r\nindividual, the late Sir Erasmus Wilson, came to the rescue, when the\r\nstone was about to be broken up into building material by the\r\nproprietor of the ground on which it lay. An iron water-tight cylinder\r\nwas constructed for its transport, in which, with much toil, the\r\nobelisk was encased and floated. It was taken in tow by a steam-tug,\r\nwhich encountered a fearful storm in the Bay of Biscay. This led to\r\nthe abandonment of the pontoon cylinder, which floated about for three\r\ndays, and was at last picked up by a passing steamer, and towed to the\r\ncoast of Spain; from whence it was brought to England, and set up\r\nwhere it now stands on the Thames Embankment. Its transport cost\r\naltogether about £13,000, and was a work of great anxiety and\r\ndifficulty. Standing seventy feet high on its present site, it forms\r\none of the noblest and most appropriate monuments of the greatest city\r\nin the world; awakening the curiosity of every passer-by regarding the\r\nmysteries revealed in its enigmatical sculptures.\r\n\r\nThe companion obelisk which had been left standing at Alexandria,\r\nafter having suffered much from neglect, in the midst of its mean and\r\nfilthy surroundings, was presented to the American Government by the\r\nKhedive of Egypt. But that Government acted in the same supine spirit\r\nin which our own had acted; and it was left to the ability of Captain\r\nCorringe as engineer, and to the liberality of the millionaire\r\nVanderbilt, who paid the expenses incurred, amounting to £20,000, to\r\nbring the obelisk in the hold of a chartered steamer across the\r\nAtlantic, and set it up in the midst of New York city. And if the one\r\nobelisk is a remarkable sight in London, the other is a still more\r\nremarkable sight in New York. There, amid the latest inventions of the\r\nWest, surrounded by the most recent civilisation of the world, rises\r\nup serenely, unchanged to heaven, the earliest monument of the East,\r\nsurrounded by the most ancient civilisation of the world. \"Westward\r\nthe course of empire takes its way;\" and as the old obelisk of\r\nHeliopolis witnessed the ending of the four first dramas of human\r\nhistory, so shall it close the fifth and last. The sun in the East\r\nrose over its birth; the sun in the West shall set over its death.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that when all the stores of coal and other fuel which\r\nform the source of the mechanical power and commercial greatness of\r\nnorthern and western nations shall have been exhausted, a method of\r\ndirectly utilising solar radiation may be discovered. And if so, then\r\nthe seat of empire will be transferred to parts of the earth that are\r\nnow burnt up by the intense heat of the sun, but which then will be\r\nthe most valuable of all possessions. The vast solar radiance now\r\nwasted on the furnace-like shores of the Red Sea will be stored up as\r\na source of mechanical power. The commerce of the West will once more\r\nreturn to the East where it began; and the whole region will be\r\nrepeopled with the life that swarmed there in the best days of old\r\nEgypt. But under that new civilisation there will be no return of the\r\nold religion of the obelisks; for men will no longer worship the sun\r\nas a god, but will use him for the common purposes of life, as a\r\nslave.\r\n\r\nAfter having thus passed in review so many noble obelisks, a mere\r\ntithe of what once existed, the conviction is deepened in our minds\r\nthat no nation had ever devoted so much time, treasure, and skill to\r\nthe service of religion as the Egyptian. While the Jews had only one\r\ntabernacle and one temple, every city in Egypt--and no country had so\r\nmany great cities--had its magnificent temple and its hosts of\r\nobelisks. The spoils of the whole world were devoted to their\r\nconstruction; a third of the produce of the whole land of Egypt was\r\nspent in their maintenance. The daily life of the people was moulded\r\nentirely upon the religion of these temples and obelisks; their art\r\nand their literature were inspired by it. It organised their society;\r\nit built up their empire; and it was the salt which for more than\r\nthree thousand years conserved a civilisation which has been the\r\nmarvel and the mystery of every succeeding age. Surely the Light which\r\nlighteth every man that cometh into the world, shone on those who were\r\nthus fervently stretching the tendrils of their souls to its dawning\r\nin the East, who raised these obelisks as symbols of the glorious and\r\nbeneficent sunlight of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE PAINTED TOMB AT VEII\r\n\r\n\r\nRome after a season becomes oppressive. Your capacity of enjoyment is\r\nexhausted. The atmosphere of excitement in which you live, owing to\r\nthe number, variety, and transcendent interest of the sights that have\r\nto be seen, wears out the nervous system, and you have an ardent\r\ndesire for a little respite and change of scene. I remember that after\r\nthe first month I had a deep longing to get away into the heart of an\r\nold wood, or into a lonely glen among the mountains, where I should\r\nsee no trace of man's handiwork, and recover the tone of my spirit\r\namid the wildness of nature. For this inevitable reaction of\r\nsight-seeing in the city, a remedy may be found by retiring for a day\r\nor two to some one or other of the numerous beautiful scenes in the\r\nneighbourhood. There is no city in the world more favourably situated\r\nfor this purpose than Rome. Some of the most charming excursions may\r\nbe made from it as a centre, starting in the morning and returning at\r\nnight. Every tourist who stays but a fortnight in the city makes a\r\npoint of seeing the idyllic waterfalls of Tivoli, the extensive ruins\r\nof Hadrian's Villa, the picturesque olive-clad slopes of Frascati and\r\nTusculum, and the lovely environs of Albano on the edge of its\r\nrichly-wooded lake. But there are spots that are less known at no\r\ngreater distance, which yet do not yield in beauty or interest to\r\nthese familiar resorts. Chief among these is Veii, whose very name\r\nhas in it a far-off old-world sound. When the Campagna has quickened\r\nunder the breath of the Italian spring into a tender greenness, and is\r\nstarred with orchids and sweet-scented narcissuses, I know nothing\r\nmore pleasant than a visit to this renowned spot.\r\n\r\nVeii was the greatest city of the Etruscan confederacy. When Rome was\r\nin its infancy it was in the height of its grandeur. After a ten\r\nyears' siege it was captured by Camillus; and so stately were its\r\nbuildings, so beautiful was the scenery around it, and so strong its\r\nnatural defences, that it was seriously proposed to abandon Rome and\r\ntransfer the population to it, and thus save the rebuilding of the\r\nhouses and temples that had been destroyed during the invasion of the\r\nGauls. It was only by a small majority that this project was set\r\naside. Veii never recovered from its overthrow. In vain the Romans\r\nattempted to make it one of their own cities by colonising it. Many\r\nfamilies established themselves there, but they were afterwards\r\nrecalled by a decree of the senate, which made it an offence\r\npunishable with death for any Roman to remain at Veii beyond a\r\nprescribed period. By degrees it dwindled away, until in the days of\r\nPropertius its site was converted into pastures; and the shepherd\r\nroamed over it with his flocks, unconscious that one of the most\r\nfamous cities of Italy once stood on the spot. So long ago as the\r\nreign of the emperor Hadrian its very locality was forgotten, and its\r\nformer existence regarded by many with incredulity as a myth of early\r\ntimes. It was left to the enlightened antiquarian skill of our own\r\ntimes, so fruitful in similar discoveries and resuscitations, to find\r\nout among the fastnesses of the wilderness around Rome its true\r\nposition. And although all the difficult problems connected with its\r\ncitadel and the circuit of its walls have not yet been solved, there\r\ncan be no doubt that the city stood in the very place which modern\r\narchæologists have determined. This place is a little village called\r\nIsola Farnese, about eleven miles north-west of Rome. The way that\r\nleads to it branches off by a side path for about three miles from the\r\nold diligence road between Florence and Rome at La Storta--the last\r\npost station where horses were changed about eight miles from the\r\ncity. It is situated amid ground so broken into heights and hollows\r\nthat you see no indications of it until you come abruptly upon it, hid\r\nin a fold of the undulating Campagna. And the loneliness of the\r\ndistrict and of all the paths leading to it is hardly relieved by the\r\nappearance of the village itself.\r\n\r\nI shall not soon forget my visit to this romantic spot, and the\r\ndelightful day I spent there with a congenial friend. We left Rome in\r\nan open one-horse carriage early one morning about the end of April.\r\nPassing out at the Porta del Popolo, we quickly traversed the squalid\r\nsuburb and crossed the Ponte Molle--the famous old Milvian Bridge. We\r\nproceeded as far as the Via Cassia on the old Flaminian Way. At the\r\njunction of these roads the villa and gardens of Ovid were situated;\r\nbut their site is now occupied by a humble osteria or wayside tavern.\r\nThe road passes over an undulating country entirely uncultivated,\r\ndiversified here and there with copses and thickets of wild figs\r\nintermixed with hawthorn, rose-bushes, and broom. A few ilexes and\r\nstone-pines arched their evergreen foliage over the road; and the\r\nsucculent milky stems of the wild fig-trees were covered with the\r\nsmall green fruit, while the downy leaves were just beginning to peep\r\nfrom their sheaths. It was one of those quiet gray days that give a\r\nmystic tone to a landscape. The cloudy sky was in harmony with the dim\r\nCampagna, that looked under the sunless smoky light unutterably sad\r\nand forlorn. Wreaths of mist lingered in the hollows like the shadowy\r\nforms of the past; the lark was silent in the sky; and on the desolate\r\nbluffs and headlands, where once stood populous cities, were a few\r\nhoary tombs whose very names had perished ages ago. But inexpressibly\r\nsad as the landscape looked it was relieved by the grand background of\r\nthe Sabine range capped with snow. The village of La Storta, that\r\nflourished in the old posting days, had fallen into decay when the\r\nrailway diverted the traffic from it; and its inn, with a rude model\r\nof St. Peter's carved in wood projecting above its door, was silent\r\nand deserted. Passing down a narrow glen, fringed with wood for three\r\nmiles from this point, we came in sight of the village of Isola. Its\r\nsituation is romantic, perched on the summit of a steep cliff, with\r\ndeep richly-wooded ravines around it, and long swelling downs rising\r\nbeyond. It is surrounded by two streams which unite and fall along\r\nwith the Formello into the river called La Valca, which has been\r\nidentified with the fatal Cremera that was dyed red with the blood of\r\nthe three hundred Fabii.\r\n\r\nThe rock of Isola is most interesting to the geologist, consisting of\r\nlarge fragments of black pumice cemented together by volcanic ashes\r\ndeposited under water. It is literally a huge heap of cinders thrown\r\nout by the rapidly intermittent action of some neighbouring volcano,\r\nprobably the crater of Baccano, or that which is now filled with the\r\nblue waters of Lake Bracciano. The whole mass is very friable, and in\r\nevery direction the soft rock is hollowed out into sepulchral caves.\r\nBy many this isolated rock is considered the arx or citadel of Veii;\r\nbut the existence of so many sepulchral caves in it is, as Mr. Dennis\r\nsays, conclusive of the fact that it was the Necropolis of the ancient\r\ncity, which must therefore, according to Etruscan and Roman usage\r\nregarding the interment of the dead, have been outside the walls. The\r\ntombs have all been rifled and destroyed, and many of the sepulchral\r\ncaves have been turned to the basest uses for stalling goats and\r\ncattle. An air of profound melancholy breathes around the whole spot.\r\nIt seems to be more connected with the dead than with the living\r\nworld. And the hamlet which now occupies the commanding site is of the\r\nmost wretched description. All its houses, which date from the\r\nfifteenth century, are ruinous, and are among the worst in Italy; and\r\nthe baronial castle which crowns the highest point,--built nearly a\r\nthousand years ago, the scene of many a conflict between the Colonnas\r\nand the Orsinis, and captured on one occasion after a twelve days'\r\nsiege by Cæsar Borgia,--has been converted into a barn. The\r\ninhabitants of the village do not exceed a hundred in number, and\r\npresent a haggard and sallow appearance--the effect of the dreadful\r\nmalaria which haunts the spot. It is strange to contrast this blighted\r\nand fever-stricken aspect of the place with the description of\r\nDionysius, who praised its air as in his time exceedingly pure and\r\nhealthy, and its territory as smiling and fruitful. In the little\r\nsquare of the village are several fragments of marble and other relics\r\nof Roman domination; and the church, about four or five hundred years\r\nold, dedicated to St. Pancrazio, is in a state of great decay. The\r\nwalls are damp and mouldy, and all the pictures and ornaments are of\r\nthe rudest description, with the exception of a faded fresco of the\r\ncoronation of the Virgin, which is a fair specimen of the art of the\r\nfifteenth century. The service of the church is supplied by some\r\ndistant priest or friar in orders.\r\n\r\nWe left our conveyance in the piazza, and took our lunch in one of the\r\nhouses. We brought our provisions with us from Rome, but we got a\r\ncoarse but palatable wine from the people, and a rude but clean room\r\nin which to enjoy our repast. This inn--if it may be called, so--had\r\nat one time a very evil reputation. But nothing could be more\r\nsimple-hearted than the landlord and his wife, with their group of\r\ntimid children who clung to their mother's skirts in dread of the\r\nstrangers. They told us that the poverty of the place was deplorable.\r\nNearly all the people were laid down during the heats of summer with\r\nfever; and they were so poor that they could not afford to keep a\r\ndoctor. Many deaths occurred, and the survivors, emaciated by the\r\ndisease, were left to drag on a weary existence embittered by numerous\r\nprivations. At a distance the village on its lofty rock, surrounded by\r\nits richly-wooded ravines, looked like a picture of Arcadia; but near\r\nat hand the sad reality dispelled the idyllic dream.\r\n\r\nTaking with us from Isola a guide, originally a big burly man, but now\r\na sad victim to malaria, we set out to visit the site of the ancient\r\ncity and the few relics which survive. It takes about four hours to\r\ncomplete the circuit of the walls; but there are four objects of\r\nspecial interest, the Arx, the Columbarium, the Ponte Sodo, and the\r\nPainted Tomb, which may be visited in less than three. The extent of\r\nthe city is surprising to those who have been in the habit of thinking\r\nthat all the ancient towns in the neighbourhood of Rome were mere\r\nvillages. Dionysius says that it was equal in size to Athens. Veii was\r\nindeed fully larger, and was about the dimensions of the city of Rome,\r\nincluded within the walls of Servius Tullius. It occupied the whole\r\nextent of the platform on which it was situated; and as the area was\r\nbounded on every side by deep ravines, its size was thus absolutely\r\ncircumscribed. Built for security and not for the comfort and progress\r\nof its inhabitants, its confined and inaccessible situation would have\r\nunfitted it to become the capital of a great nation, as was at one\r\ntime proposed. Passing down a richly-wooded glen by a path overhanging\r\na stream, we came to a molino or polenta mill, most romantically\r\nsituated. Here a fine cascade, about eighty feet high, plunges over\r\nthe volcanic rock into a deep gulley overshadowed by bushy ilexes. The\r\nscenery is very picturesque, and differs widely from that of the rest\r\nof the Campagna. In its profusion of broom and hawthorn bushes, whose\r\ngolden and snowy blossoms contrasted beautifully with the dark hues of\r\nthe evergreen oaks, and in the snowy gleam of its falling waters, and\r\nthe hoary gray of its lichen-clad cliffs, it presented features of\r\nresemblance to Scottish scenery. It had indeed a peculiar home look\r\nabout it which produced a very pleasing impression upon our minds.\r\nCrossing the stream above the cascade by stepping-stones, between\r\nwhich the water rushed with a strong current, we entered the wide\r\ndown upon which Veii stood. No one would have supposed that this was\r\nthe site of one of the most important ancient cities, which held at\r\nbay for ten long years the Roman army, and yielded at last to\r\nstratagem and not to force. Not a vestige of a ruin could be seen. In\r\nthe heart of the city the grass was growing in all the soft green\r\ntransparency of spring, and a few fields of corn were marked out and\r\nshowed the tender braird above the soil. The relics of the walls that\r\ncrowned the cliffs have almost entirely disappeared. No Etruscan site\r\nhas so few remains; and yet its interest is intensified by the extreme\r\ndesolation. It is more suggestive to the imagination because of the\r\npaucity of its objects to appeal to the eye. Legend and history haunt\r\nthe spot with nothing to distract the mind or dispel its musing\r\nmelancholy. All trace of human passion has disappeared, and only the\r\neternal calm of nature broods over the spot; the calm that was before\r\nman came upon the scene, and that shall be after all his labour is\r\nover.\r\n\r\nOn a part of these downs overgrown with briars was situated the Roman\r\nMunicipium, a colony founded after the subjugation of Veii. It did not\r\ncover more than a third of the area of the ancient city. Several\r\nexcavations were made here, which resulted in the discovery, among\r\nother interesting relics of the imperial period, of the colossal heads\r\nof Augustus and Tiberius and the mutilated statue of Germanicus now in\r\nthe Vatican Gallery. On this spot were also found the twelve Ionic\r\ncolumns of white marble which now form the portico of the post-office\r\nin the Piazza Colonna at Rome, and also a few of the pillars which\r\nadorn the magnificent Basilica of St. Paul's on the Ostian Road. No\r\none looking at these grand columns, so stainless in hue and so perfect\r\nin form, would have supposed that they had formed part of the Roman\r\nForum of Veii more than two thousand years ago. Those in front of the\r\npost-office look newer than the rest of the building, which is not\r\nmore than sixty years old. They owed their perfect preservation\r\ndoubtless to the fact that they were buried deep under the dry\r\nvolcanic soil for most of the intervening period. It seems strange to\r\nthink of these ancient columns, that looked down upon the legal\r\ntransactions of Roman Veii, now standing in one of the busiest squares\r\nof modern Rome, associated with one of the most characteristic and\r\nimportant of our modern institutions, of which ancient Rome had not\r\neven the germ.\r\n\r\nPassing through a beautiful copse wood, where cyclamens grew in lavish\r\nprofusion, forming little rosy clusters about the oak-stools and\r\ndiffusing a faint spicy smell through the warm air, we came out at one\r\nof the gates of the city into open ground. This gate is simply a gap\r\nin a shapeless mound, with traces of an ancient roadway passing\r\nthrough it and fragments of walls on either side. Where the stones can\r\nbe seen projecting through the turf embankment they are smaller than\r\nusual in Etruscan cities. Sir William Gell found hereabouts a portion\r\nof the wall composed of enormous blocks of tufa--three or four yards\r\nlong and more than five feet in height--based upon three courses of\r\nthin bricks three feet in length, that rested upon the naked rock.\r\nSuch a mode of wall construction has no resemblance to anything\r\nremaining in Rome or in any Etruscan city. It indicates a still higher\r\nantiquity; while the brick foundations remind us of the fame which the\r\nEtruscans and particularly the people of Veii had acquired on account\r\nof their skill in works of terra cotta. The famous Quadriga or brick\r\nchariot which adorned the pediment of the great temple of Jupiter on\r\nthe Capitol at Rome was made at Veii, and was a remarkable proof of\r\nthe superiority of its people in this species of art. Indeed the name\r\nof Veii is supposed to have been derived from its skill in the\r\nmanufacture of terra cotta chariots. The old gateway through which we\r\npassed out of the wood was probably the principal entrance into the\r\ncity, and the one over which Tolumnius King of Veii appeared, standing\r\non the wall, during the famous siege when he was challenged to mortal\r\ncombat by Cornelius Cossus, as graphically described by Livy.\r\n\r\nBeneath this gate there is a remarkable tunnel called the Ponte Sodo,\r\nbored in the volcanic rock for the passage of the river. It is not,\r\nhowever, visible from this point. You require to descend the steep\r\nbanks of the river to see it; and a very extraordinary excavation it\r\nis, two hundred and forty feet long, sixteen feet wide, and twenty\r\nfeet high. It was doubtless made to prevent the evil effects of winter\r\nfloods by the inhabitants of Veii, who had considerable skill in such\r\nengineering works. The river sometimes fills the tunnel to the very\r\nroof, leaving behind trunks and branches of trees firmly wedged in the\r\nclefts of the rock in the inside. It was extremely interesting to\r\nstand on this spot and see before me this wonderful Etruscan work, and\r\nto lave my hands in the waters of the Formello, which, under the\r\nclassical name of the Cremera, was prominently associated with early\r\nRoman history. It would be difficult to find a lovelier dimple in the\r\nfair face of mother earth than the valley through which the Formello\r\nflows. Precipitous cliffs rose from the bed of the river opposite to\r\nme, enriched with all the hues that volcanic rock assumes under the\r\ninfluences of the weather and the garniture of moss and lichen. A\r\nperfect tangle of vegetation crowned their tops and fringed their\r\nsides; the dark unchanging verdure of the evergreen oak and ivy\r\ncontrasting beautifully with the tender autumn-like tints in which the\r\nvaried spring foliage of the brushwood appeared. Bright flowers and\r\ngay blossoms grew in every crevice and nook. The shallow river flowed\r\nat my feet through ruts of dark volcanic sand, and amid masses of rock\r\nfallen from the cliffs, and stones whose artificial appearance showed\r\nthat they had formed part of the ramparts that once ran round the\r\nwhole circuit of the heights. The sunshine sparkled on the gray-green\r\nwaters, and followed them in bright coruscations for a short distance\r\ninto the mouth of the tunnel, the other end of which, diminished by\r\nthe distance, opened into the daylight like the eye-piece of an\r\ninverted telescope. I found in the bed of the river fragments of\r\nmarble and porphyry, cut and polished, that had doubtless come from\r\nthe pavement of some palace or temple, and attested the truth of the\r\nreport that has come down to us, that the buildings of Veii were\r\nstately and magnificent. To me there is something peculiarly\r\nimpressive in the presence of a stream in a scene of vanished human\r\ngreatness. Its eternal sameness contrasts with the momentous changes\r\nthat have taken place; its motion with the death around; its sunny\r\nsparkle with the gloom; while its murmur seems the very requiem of the\r\npast. In this giant sepulchre, into which, like the Gulf of Curtius in\r\nthe Forum, all the greatness of Etruscan and Roman Veii had gone down,\r\nthe abundance of life was most remarkable. The vegetation sprang up\r\nwith a rank luxuriance unknown in northern latitudes; lizards darted\r\nthrough the long grass; one snake of considerable length and girth\r\nuncoiled itself before me and crawled leisurely away; and the air, as\r\nbright and warm as it is in July with us, was murmurous with the hum\r\nof insects that danced in the April sunshine.\r\n\r\nBeyond the Ponte Sodo the precipices disappear and the ground slopes\r\ndown gently to the edge of the river. Here the valley of the Formello\r\nopens up--a quiet green pastoral spot rising on the right hand into\r\nbare swelling downs, without a tree, or a bush, or a rock to diversify\r\ntheir surface. On the sloping banks of the river the rock has been cut\r\ninto a number of basins filled with water, where Sir William Gell\r\nsupposes that the nymphs of Veii, like those of Troy, \"washed their\r\nwhite garments in the days of peace;\" but they were in all likelihood\r\nonly holes caused by the quarrying of the blocks of stone used in the\r\nconstruction of the walls and buildings of the city. The slopes of\r\nthis valley seem to have formed the principal Necropolis of Veii.\r\nNumerous tombs were discovered in it; but after having been rifled of\r\ntheir contents they were filled up again, and all traces of them have\r\ndisappeared. Only one sepulchre now remains open in the Necropolis,\r\nhalf way up the slope of a mound called the _Poggio Reale_. It is\r\ncommonly known as \"The Painted Tomb,\" or _La Grotta Campana_--after\r\nits discoverer, the Marchese Campana of Rome--who got permission\r\nforty-five years ago from the Queen of Sardinia, to whom the property\r\nthen belonged, to dig in this locality for jewels and other relics of\r\nantiquity. Instead of closing the tomb, as was done in the other\r\ncases, this accomplished antiquarian, with the good taste for which he\r\nwas distinguished, left it in the exact condition in which he had\r\nfound it, so that it might be an object of interest to future\r\nvisitors. Ascending the slope, we entered a long narrow passage about\r\nsix feet wide and about fourteen feet deep cut through the tufa rock.\r\nThis was the original entrance to the tomb; and the discoverer had\r\ncleared it out by removing the earth that had accumulated in the\r\ncourse of ages. A solitary crouching lion, carved in a species of\r\nvolcanic stone, guarded the entrance of the passage. Its companion had\r\nbeen removed some distance, and lay neglected on the slope of the\r\nhill. The sculpture is exceedingly uncouth and primitive. At the inner\r\nend of the passage a couple of similar lions crouch, one on each side\r\nof the door of the tomb. They were placed there in all likelihood as\r\nsymbols of avenging wrath to inspire fear, and thus prevent the\r\ndesecration of the dead. Originally the tomb was closed by a great\r\nslab of volcanic stone: but this having been broken to pieces and\r\ncarried away to build the first sheepfold or the nearest peasant's\r\nhut, it has been replaced by an iron gate. The walls around were damp\r\nand covered with moss and weeds, and the bars of the gate were rusty.\r\nOur guide applied the key he had brought with him, and the gate opened\r\nwith a creaking sound. Lighting a candle, he preceded us into the\r\ntomb. I cannot describe the strange mixture of feelings which took\r\npossession of me,--wonder, curiosity, and awe. This was my first visit\r\nto an Etruscan tomb. In Rome I had been familiar with the monuments\r\nof a remote past; I had gazed with interest upon objects over which\r\ntwenty centuries had passed. But here I was to behold one of the\r\nmysterious relics of the world's childhood. I had previously read with\r\ndeep interest the graphic account of this tomb, which Mr. Dennis gives\r\nin his _Cities and Cemeteries of Etruria_, and was therefore prepared\r\nin large measure for what I was about to see.\r\n\r\nI found myself when I entered in a gloomy chamber hewn out of a brown\r\narenaceous clay. The floor was a loose mud, somewhat slippery; and on\r\nit I noticed a number of vases, large and small, and of various forms.\r\nThey were not like the exquisite painted vases which we are accustomed\r\nto associate with the name of Etruscan, but of the simplest and most\r\narchaic shapes, formed out of the coarsest clay. Some of them had a\r\ncurious squat appearance, with rude figures painted on them; while\r\nothers of them were about three feet high, of dark-brown earthenware,\r\nand were ornamented with some simple device in neutral tints or in\r\nvery low relief. They were empty now; but when found they contained\r\nashes and fragments of calcined bones. Just within the door there were\r\ntwo stone benches, on each of which, when the tomb was opened, was\r\nstretched a skeleton, which rapidly crumbled under the pressure of the\r\nair into a cloud of dust. That on the left was supposed to have been a\r\nfemale; and her companion on the right had doubtless been a warrior,\r\njudging from the bronze helmet and breastplate, both much corroded,\r\nthat were left lying on the bench. He had evidently come by a violent\r\ndeath, for at the back of the helmet was an ugly hole, whose ragged\r\nside was outwards, showing that the fierce thrust of the spear had\r\ncrashed through the face, and protruded beyond the casque. The\r\ncombination of cinerary urns containing ashes, and of stone couches on\r\nwhich dead bodies were extended in the same tomb, is curious, showing\r\nthat both modes of sepulture were practised at this period. The\r\nskeletons found entire were evidently those of the master and\r\nmistress of the household, persons of consideration; and the ashes in\r\nthe jars were probably the remains of the servants and dependants. On\r\nthe benches beside the skeletons were a bronze laver and mirror, a\r\nsimple candlestick, and a brazier used for burning perfumes. The vases\r\nwere exceedingly interesting, as the first rude attempts of the\r\nEtruscans in an art in which afterwards they attained to such\r\nmarvellous perfection, and the only relics now remaining of the\r\nfictile statuary for which Veil was so celebrated.\r\n\r\nBut my interest in these objects was speedily transferred to a far\r\nmore wonderful sight, which the candle of the guide disclosed to me.\r\nOn the inner wall, which divided the tomb into two chambers, and on\r\nthe right and left of the door leading from the one to the other, was\r\na most extraordinary fresco. Seen in the dim light of the candle\r\npassing over the different parts, it had a singularly weird and\r\ngrotesque appearance. The colours were as fresh as if they had been\r\nlaid on yesterday; and the thought at first flashed across my mind\r\nthat I was gazing not upon a painting which had been sealed up for\r\nnearly thirty centuries, but upon the rude attempts at art of some\r\nmodern shepherd or rustic belonging to the village of Isola, who\r\nsought thus to amuse his leisure moments. But such a thought was\r\ndismissed at once as absurd. No one after a few moments' inspection\r\ncould doubt the genuineness of the painting. It is difficult to\r\ndescribe it, for it is altogether unlike anything to be seen elsewhere\r\nin Egyptian or Assyrian, in Greek or Roman tombs. On the right side of\r\nthe door the upper half of the wall was panelled off by a band of\r\ncolour, and represented one scene or picture. In the centre was a\r\nlarge horse, that reminded me of a child's wooden toy-horse, such as\r\none sees at a country fair. Its legs were unnaturally long and thin;\r\nand the slenderness of its barrel was utterly disproportioned to the\r\nbreadth of its chest. It was coloured in the most curious fashion:\r\nthe head, hind-quarters, and near-leg being black; the tail and mane\r\nand off-legs yellow; and the rest of the body red, with round yellow\r\nspots. It was led by a tall groom; a diminutive youth was mounted upon\r\nits back; and a proud, dignified-looking personage, having a\r\ndouble-headed axe or hammer on his shoulder, strode in front. These\r\nhuman figures were all naked, and painted of a deep-red colour. In the\r\nsame picture I noticed two strange-looking nondescript animals, very\r\nrudely drawn, and party-coloured like the horse. One probably\r\nrepresented a cat without a tail, like the Manx breed, half-lying upon\r\nthe back of the horse, and laying its paw on the shoulder of the youth\r\nmounted before it; and the other looked like a dog, with open mouth,\r\napparently barking with all his might, running among the feet of the\r\nhorse. Interspersed with these figures were most uncouth drawings of\r\nflowers, growing up from the ground, and forming fantastic wreaths\r\nround the picture, all party-coloured in the same way as the animals.\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary fresco seemed like the scene which presented itself\r\nto the apostle, when one of the seals of the Apocalyptic book was\r\nopened. I wished that I had beside me some authoritative interpreter\r\nwho could read for me \"this mystic handwriting on the wall.\" It has\r\nbeen suggested that the silent scene before me represented the passage\r\nof a soul to the world of the dead. The lean and starved-looking horse\r\nsymbolised death; and its red and yellow spots indicated corruption.\r\nIt may have been the ghost of the horse that was burned with the body\r\nof his dead master; for we know that the tribes, from which the\r\nEtruscans were supposed to be descended, if not the Etruscans\r\nthemselves, not only burned their dead, but offered along with them\r\nthe wives, slaves, horses, and other property of the dead upon their\r\nfuneral pyre. The horse in this remarkable fresco may therefore have\r\nbeen the death-horse, which is well-known in Eastern and European\r\nfolklore. The diminutive figure which it carried on its back was the\r\nsoul of the dead person buried in this tomb; and its small size and\r\nthe fact of its being on horseback might have been suggested by the\r\nthought of the long way it had to go, and its last appearance to the\r\nmortal eyes that had anxiously watched it from the extreme verge of\r\nthis world as it vanished in the dim distance of the world beyond. The\r\ngroom that led the horse and his rider was the Thanatis or Fate that\r\nhad inflicted the death-blow; and the figure with the hammer was\r\nprobably intended for the Mantus--the Etruscan Dispater--who led the\r\nway to another state of existence. The deep-red colour of the human\r\nfigures indicated not only that they belonged to the male sex, but\r\nalso that they were in a state of glorification. This is further\r\nconfirmed by the flowers, which looked like those of the lotus,\r\nuniversally regarded amongst the ancients as symbols of immortality.\r\nIt is difficult to say what part the domestic animals were meant to\r\nplay in this scene of apotheosis. Painted with the same hues as those\r\nof the steed, they were doubtless sacrificed at the death of their\r\nmaster, in order that they might share his fortunes and accompany him\r\ninto the unseen world; their affection for him, and the reluctance\r\nwith which they parted from him, being indicated by the cat putting\r\nits paw upon his shoulder as if to pull him back, and the dog barking\r\nfuriously at the heels of the horse. But all this is merely\r\nconjectural. And yet I caught such a glimpse of the general\r\nsignificance of the picture, of the spirit that prompted it, as deeply\r\nimpressed me. It seemed as if my own searching dimly with a candle in\r\nthe inside of a dark sepulchral cave into the meaning of this fresco\r\nof death was emblematical of the groping of the ancient Etruscans, by\r\nsuch feeble light of nature as they possessed, in the midst of the\r\nprofound, terrible darkness of death, for the great truths of\r\nimmortality. They had not heard of One who alone with returning\r\nfootsteps had broken the eternal silence of the tomb, and brought the\r\nhope of immortal life to the sleeping dead around. These Etruscan\r\nsleepers had been laid to rest in their narrow cell ages before the\r\nSon of Man had rolled away the stone from the door of the sepulchre,\r\nand carried captivity captive; but He whom they ignorantly worshipped\r\nhad partially lifted the veil and given them faint glimpses of the\r\nthings unseen and eternal. And these were doubtless sufficient to\r\nredeem their life from its vanity and their death from its fear.\r\n\r\nBelow the fresco which I have thus minutely described is another about\r\nthe same size, representing a sphinx, with a nondescript animal, which\r\nmay be either an ass or a young deer standing below it, and a panther\r\nor leopard sitting behind in a rampant attitude, with one paw on the\r\nhaunch of the sphinx, and the other on the tail, and its face turned\r\ntowards the spectator. The face of the sphinx is painted red. The\r\nfigure bears some resemblance to the Egyptian type of that chimera in\r\nits straight black hair depending behind, and its oblique eyes; but in\r\nother respects it diverges widely. On Egyptian monuments the sphinx\r\nnever appears standing as in this fresco, but crouching in the\r\nattitude of reposeful observation. Its form also was always fuller and\r\nmore rounded than the long-legged, attenuated spectre before us, and\r\nit was invariably wingless; whereas the Etruscan sphinx had short\r\nwings with curling points, spotted and barred with stripes of black,\r\nred, and yellow. This strange mixture of the human and the brutal\r\nmight be regarded as a symbol of the religious state of the people. We\r\nsee in it higher conceptions of religion struggling out of lower. In\r\nthe recumbent wingless sphinx of Egypt we see anthropomorphic ideas of\r\nreligion emerging out of the gross animal-worship of more primitive\r\ntimes. In the standing and winged Etruscan Sphinx we see these ideas\r\nassuming a more predominant form; while in the Greek mythology the\r\nemancipation of the human from the brutal was complete, and the gods\r\nappeared wholly in the likeness of men.\r\n\r\nOn the wall on the opposite side of the door were two other frescoes,\r\nsomewhat similar in general appearance to those already described. On\r\nthe upper panel was a horse with a boy on his back, and a panther\r\nsitting on the ground behind him; while on the lower panel there was a\r\nhuge standing panther or leopard, with his long tongue hanging out of\r\nhis mouth, and a couple of dogs beneath him, one lifting up its paw,\r\nand the other trying to catch the protruded tongue of the panther. All\r\nthe figures in the four frescoes were painted in the same bizarre\r\nstyle of red, yellow, and black characteristic of the first fresco\r\ndescribed; and they had all the same Oriental border of lotus flowers.\r\nThey had evidently all the same symbolic import; for the sphinx\r\nguarded the gate of the unseen world, and leopards or panthers were\r\nfrequently introduced into the paintings of Etruscan tombs as\r\nguardians of the dead.\r\n\r\nPassing through the doorway I entered an inner and smaller chamber,\r\nwhose only decoration was six small round discs on the opposite wall,\r\neach about fifteen inches in diameter, painted in little segments of\r\nvarious colours,--black, blue, red, yellow, and gray. What they were\r\nmeant to represent no one has satisfactorily explained. Above them I\r\nobserved a number of rusty nails fixed in the wall, and traces of\r\nothers that had fallen out around the doorway. On these nails were\r\noriginally suspended various articles of household economy or of\r\npersonal ornament; for the Etruscan sepulchres were always furnished\r\nwith such things as the tenants took delight in when living. For a\r\nproof of this nothing could be more satisfactory than a thorough study\r\nof Inghirami's voluminous work. Indeed, all ancient nations buried\r\ntheir dead not only with their weapons and armour, but also with their\r\nmost precious possessions; and in proportion to the rank and wealth of\r\nthe deceased were the number and value of the offerings deposited with\r\nhim in his tomb. We are amazed at the variety and preciousness of the\r\ngolden ornaments found by Dr. Schliemann in the tombs at Mycenæ; and\r\nevery Etruscan cemetery that has been opened has yielded an immense\r\nnumber of most precious articles, which the devotion of the survivors\r\nsacrificed to the manes of their departed friends. It is to this\r\npropensity that we owe all our knowledge of this mysterious race. But\r\nthe fact, as Mr. Dennis says, that the nails in the interior of this\r\ntomb were empty, and that no fragments of the objects suspended were\r\nfound at the foot of the wall, indicated either that the articles had\r\ndecayed, being of a perishable nature, or that they had been carried\r\noff on account of their superior value. This last is the more probable\r\nsupposition. The Marchese Campana, who opened the tomb, was late in\r\nthe field, and had in all likelihood been anticipated by some previous\r\nexplorer. The work of plundering Etruscan tombs was begun, we have\r\nreason to believe, in the time of the early Romans, who were\r\nattracted, not merely by the precious metals which they contained, but\r\nalso by the reputation of their vases, which in the days of the Empire\r\nwere held in as high esteem as now. Many tombs have doubtless been\r\nrepeatedly searched. The very architects employed in their\r\nconstruction, as Signor Avolta conjectures, may have preserved the\r\nsecret of the concealed entrance, and used it for the purpose of\r\nspoliation afterwards. Indeed, an unviolated tomb is a very rare\r\nexception. No modern excavations were made till about sixty years ago;\r\nand yet during that short interval many tombs that were opened and\r\nfilled up again have been forgotten; and now they are being dug afresh\r\nby persons ignorant of this, who spend their labour only to be\r\ndisappointed. There is little reason, therefore, to believe that the\r\nPainted Tomb of Veii was so fortunate as to escape all notice until\r\nthe Marchese Campana had discovered it. Former visitors had robbed it\r\nin all likelihood of any objects of intrinsic value it may have\r\ncontained, and left only the bronze utensils and armour and the rude\r\narchaic vases.\r\n\r\nOn the roughly-hewn roof of this inner chamber of the tomb were\r\ncarved in high relief two beams in imitation of the rafters of a\r\nhouse; and round the walls at the foot ran a low ledge formed out of\r\nthe rock, like a family couch, on which stood three very curious boxes\r\nof earthenware, about a foot and a half long and a foot high, covered\r\nwith a projecting lid on which was moulded a human head. These were\r\nsepulchral urns of a most primitive form, intermediate between the\r\nso-called hut-urns found under the lava in the Necropolis of Alba\r\nLonga, and supposed to represent the tents in which the Etruscans\r\nlived at the time of their arrival in Italy, and the round vases of a\r\nlater period. On the same ledge were several vases painted in bands of\r\nred and yellow, with a row of uncouth animals executed in relief upon\r\nthe rim. The form and contents of this chamber afforded striking proof\r\nof the fact that the Etruscan tombs were imitations of the homes of\r\nthe living. These tombs were constructed upon two types: one rising in\r\nthe form of a tumulus or conical mound above the ground when the\r\nsituation was a level table-land, and the other consisting of one or\r\ntwo chambers excavated out of the rock when the tomb was situated on\r\nthe precipitous face of a hill. Dr. Isaac Taylor, in his admirable\r\n_Etruscan Researches_, says that the former type recalled the tent,\r\nand the latter the cave, which were the original habitations of men.\r\nThe ancestors of the Etruscans are supposed by him to have been a\r\nnomadic race, wandering over the steppes of Asia, and to have dwelt\r\neither in caves or tents. At the present day the yourts or permanent\r\nhouses in Siberia and Tartary are modelled on the plan of both kinds\r\nof habitation--the upper part being above the ground, representing the\r\ntent; and the lower part being subterranean, representing the cave.\r\nAnd so the descendants of this Asiatic horde, having migrated at a\r\nremote period to Italy, preserved the burial traditions of their\r\nremote ancestors, and formed their tombs after the model of the tent\r\nor cave, according as they were constructed on the level plateau or\r\nin the rocky brow of a hill. In further illustration of this theory\r\nhe says that in olden times when a member of the Tartar tribe died,\r\nthe tent in which he breathed his last, with all its contents intact,\r\nwas converted into a tomb by simply covering it with a conical mound\r\nof earth or stones, in order to preserve it from the ravages of wolves\r\nand other beasts of prey. Even the row of stones that surrounded the\r\noutside of the tent and kept down the skins that covered it from being\r\nblown away by the storms of the steppe, was introduced into the\r\nstructure of the tomb, and continued to surround the base of the\r\nfuneral mound. He finds traces of this circle of stones in the podium\r\nor low wall of masonry which encircled every Etruscan tumulus or\r\noutside tomb, and a remarkable example in the mounds of the Horatii\r\nand Curiatii on the Appian Way at Rome.\r\n\r\nThis theory, however, it is only fair to state, is disputed by other\r\nwriters, who assert that there was no intentional imitation of tents\r\nin Etruscan tombs; for if this had been the design there would have\r\nbeen a correspondence between the conical outside and the conical\r\ninterior, and no Etruscan tomb has been found with a bell-shaped\r\nchamber. The tent-like tumulus, say they, was but the mere rude mound\r\nof earth heaped over the dead in an uncultured age; and the mound\r\nwould be made higher and larger according to the dignity of the\r\ndeceased; and the podium or row of stones around its foot was simply\r\nthe retaining wall necessary to give it stability and shape. The tomb\r\nat Veii had a narrow entrance-passage; and we find this a marked\r\nfeature in all Etruscan tombs, which are approached by a vaulted\r\npassage of masonry, varying from twelve to a hundred feet in length.\r\nThis also, according to Dr. Taylor, was but a survival of the low\r\nentrance-passage through which the ancient Siberians crept into their\r\nsubterranean habitations, and which the modern Laplanders and\r\nEsquimaux still construct before their snow-huts and underground\r\ndwellings, to serve the purpose of a door in keeping out the wind and\r\nmaintaining the temperature of the interior.\r\n\r\nThe other, or cave type of Etruscan tomb, is that which we see at\r\nVeii, and of which there are hundreds of examples all over Central\r\nItaly, wherever there are deep valleys bounded by low cliffs. This,\r\ntoo, was modelled after the pattern of the house. There were usually\r\ntwo chambers, an outer and an inner one. The outer was the place of\r\nmeeting between the living and the dead; the surviving friends feasted\r\nthere during their annual visit to the tomb, while the dead were laid\r\nin the inner chamber in the midst of familiar objects. Here everything\r\nwas designed to keep up the delusion that the dead were still living\r\nin their own homes. The roof of the chamber was carved in imitation of\r\nthe roof-tree, the rafters, and even the tiles of the house; the rock\r\naround was hewn into couches, with cushions and footstools like those\r\non which they reposed when living; on the floor were the wine-jars,\r\nthe vases, and utensils, consecrated by long use; on the various\r\nprojections were suspended the mirrors, arms, and golden ornaments\r\nthat were most prized; while the walls were painted with gay frescoes,\r\nrepresenting scenes of festivity in which eating and drinking, music\r\nand dancing, played a prominent part. And as the ordinary habitation\r\ncontained the family, the grandparents, the parents, and the children,\r\nall living under the same roof, so the Etruscan tombs were all family\r\nabodes--the dead of a whole generation being deposited in the same\r\ninner chamber.\r\n\r\nTo the outer chamber, as I have said, came the surviving members of\r\nthe family at least once a year to hold a funeral feast, and pay their\r\ndevotions to their departed friends. The tombs of this people were\r\nthus at the same time also their temples--the sacred places where they\r\ncame to perform the rites of their religion, which consisted in\r\nworshipping the lares and penates of their beloved dead, and making\r\nofferings to them. And by this striking link of the cultus of the dead\r\nthe ancient Etruscans were connected with the present inhabitants of\r\nNorthern Asia, the Finns, Laplanders, Tartars, Mongols, and Chinese,\r\nwho have no temples or places of special honour for their idols, but\r\nassemble once a year or oftener at the graves of their ancestors to\r\nworship the dead. But after all there is no great difference in this\r\nrespect between the races, ancient and modern; for the churchyard and\r\nthe church, the burial vaults and monuments within the cathedral and\r\nchapel, show how universal is the instinct that associates the dead\r\nwith the shrine of religion, and makes the tomb the most appropriate\r\nplace for giving expression to those blessed hopes of immortality upon\r\nwhich all religion is founded. The sanctuary of the Holy Land derived\r\nits sacredness, as well as the charter of its inheritance, from the\r\ncave of Machpelah. Around that patriarchal tomb clustered all the\r\ngrand religious hopes of the covenant people. The early Christians\r\nadopted and purified the Etruscan custom which they found in Rome, and\r\nerected over the tombs of the martyrs and other illustrious persons\r\n_Cellæ Memoriæ_, or memorial chapels, in which on anniversary\r\noccasions the friends and brethren assembled to partake of a funeral\r\nfeast in honour of the dead. The primitive Agapæ, or love-feasts, were\r\noften nothing more than such banquets in the memorial cells at the\r\ntombs of the faithful. And in our own country, many of our most\r\nimportant churches, towns, and villages took their origin and name\r\nfrom the grave of some saint, who in far-off times hallowed the spot\r\nand made it a shrine of worship.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous indications that this Painted Tomb at Veii is of\r\nvery great antiquity, and may be considered as probably the oldest\r\ntomb in Europe. No inscription of any kind has been found on its walls\r\nor any of its contents; and this circumstance, which is almost\r\nsingular so far as all Etruscan tombs yet discovered are concerned, of\r\nitself indicates a very remote date, when the art of letters if known\r\nat all was only known to a privileged few, and confined to public and\r\nsacred monuments. No clue remains to inform us who the Veientine\r\nwarrior was who met his death in so tragic a manner, and who lay down\r\nwith his wife and dependants in this tomb, and took the last long\r\nsleep without a thought of posterity or the conclusions they might\r\nform regarding him. And the argument of hoary antiquity derived from\r\nthis speechless silence of the tomb is still further strengthened by\r\narchitectural evidence. The outer wall as seen from the inside is\r\nbuilt of rough uncemented blocks of the earliest polygonal\r\nconstruction, such as we see in a few of the oldest Cyclopean cities\r\nof Central Italy; and the doorway is formed by the gradual convergence\r\nof stones laid in horizontal courses, instead of being arched by\r\nregular wedges of stone held together. Now, as the perfect arch was\r\nknown and constructed in Etruria at a very early period, this\r\npseudo-vault, which indicates complete ignorance of the principle,\r\nmust belong to a very remote age indeed--to the period of the\r\nCyclopean gateways of Italy and Greece, whose origin is lost in the\r\nmist of a far-off antiquity. There are two limits within which the\r\ndate of the tomb may probably be placed. While its style and\r\ndecorations are genuinely national and characteristic of the primitive\r\nEtruscan tomb, there can be no doubt that several Egyptian features in\r\nit, such as the sphinx and the lotus, and in some respects the\r\ncolouring and physiognomy of the human figures, indicate some\r\nacquaintance with the land of the Nile. Now an inscription has been\r\nfound at Karnac which records that Egypt was invaded by a\r\nconfederation of Libyans, Etruscans, and other races, and was only\r\nsaved after a desperate struggle by the valour of Menephtah I. of the\r\nNineteenth Dynasty. The allied forces occupied the country for a time,\r\nand took away with them when they departed large spoils, consisting\r\namong other things of bronze knives and armour. This happened in the\r\nfourteenth or fifteenth century before Christ. There can be no doubt,\r\ntherefore, that the civilisation of Egypt must at this period have\r\nbeen spread by commerce or war among the Western nations, and produced\r\na powerful influence upon the Etruscans. The imitation of Egyptian\r\nmodels is not so decided in this tomb as it is in the painted tombs of\r\nTarquinii and other Etruscan cities of later date; and this\r\ncircumstance would indicate that it was constructed at the very\r\ncommencement of the intercourse of Etruria with Egypt. If we take this\r\nhistoric fact as the limit in one direction, the tomb cannot be older\r\nthan three thousand three hundred years. On the other hand, we know\r\nthat Veii was destroyed about four hundred years before Christ, and\r\nremained uninhabited and desolate till the commencement of the Empire;\r\nwe have, therefore, the surest ground for fixing the date of the tomb\r\nprior to that event. Somewhere between the invasion of Egypt by the\r\nEtruscan confederacy and the fall of Veii--that is, somewhere between\r\nthe fourteenth and the fourth century before Christ--this sepulchre\r\nwas hewn in the rock and its tenants interred in it.\r\n\r\nCarlo Avolta of Corneto on one occasion, opening an Etruscan tomb at\r\nTarquinii, saw a most wonderful sight. From an aperture which he had\r\nmade above the door of the sepulchre he looked in, and for fully five\r\nminutes \"gazed upon an Etruscan monarch lying on his stone bier,\r\ncrowned with gold, clothed in armour, with a shield, spear, and arrows\r\nby his side.\" But as he gazed the figure collapsed, and finally\r\ndisappeared; and by the time an entrance was made all that remained\r\nwas the golden crown, some fragments of armour, and a handful of gray\r\ndust. Like that Etruscan tomb has been the fate of the Etruscan\r\nconfederacy. This mighty people left traces of their civilisation\r\n\"inferior in grandeur perhaps to the monuments of Egypt, in beauty to\r\nthose of Greece, but with these exceptions surpassing in both the\r\nrelics of any other nation of remote antiquity.\" At the period of\r\ntheir highest power they lived in close neighbourhood and connection\r\nwith a people who got its laws, its rulers, its arts, its religion\r\nfrom them--and might therefore if only in gratitude have preserved\r\ntheir history. But their fate was that of the similar civilisation of\r\nMexico and Peru, which its selfish Spanish conquerors instead of\r\npreserving sought studiously to obliterate. The comprehensive history\r\nof Etruria written in twenty volumes by the emperor Claudius--who,\r\nthough very feeble in other things, was yet a scholar, and could have\r\ngiven us much interesting information--perished. Their language, which\r\nsurvived their absorption by Rome, almost as late as the time of the\r\nCæsars, finally disappeared; and though thousands of inscriptions in\r\ntombs and on works of art remain--which we are able to read from the\r\nclose resemblance of the alphabet to the Greek--the key to the\r\ninterpretation of the language is gone beyond recall. In an age that\r\nhas unravelled the Egyptian hieroglyphics, and the cuneiform\r\ncharacters of Assyria, and the runic inscriptions of Northern Europe,\r\nthe Etruscan language presents almost the only philological problem\r\nthat refuses to be solved. Thus when the air and the light of modern\r\ninvestigation penetrated into the mystery which surrounded this\r\nstrange people, all that was most important had vanished; and only the\r\nfew ornaments of the tomb remained to tell us of a lost world of art,\r\nliterature, and human life which had perished not by internal\r\nexhaustion, but had fallen before the arms of Rome in the full\r\nmaturity of its civilisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nHOLED STONES AND MARTYR WEIGHTS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the porch of the interesting old church of Sta. Maria in Cosmedin\r\nnear the Tiber is preserved a huge circular stone like a millstone. It\r\nis composed of white marble, upwards of five feet in diameter, and is\r\nfinished after the model of the dramatic mask used in the ancient\r\ntheatres. In the centre is a round hole perforating the mass right\r\nthrough, forming the mouth of the mask. It is called the Bocca della\r\nVerita, and has given its name to the irregular piazza in which the\r\nchurch is situated. It is so called from the use to which it has been\r\nput from time immemorial, as an ordeal for testing the guilt or\r\ninnocence of an accused person. If the suspected individual on making\r\nan affirmation thrust his hand through the hole and was able to draw\r\nit back again, he was pronounced innocent; but if, on the contrary,\r\nthe hand remained fixed in the marble jaws, the person was declared to\r\nhave sworn falsely and was pronounced guilty. The marble mouth was\r\nsupposed by the superstitious to contract or expand itself according\r\nto the moral character of the arraigned person. No reason has been\r\ngiven why this singular marble mask should have been placed in this\r\nchurch, nor is anything known of its previous history. Some have\r\nconjectured that it served as an impluvium or mouth of a drain in the\r\ncentre of a court to let the water run off; and others regard it as\r\nhaving been an ornament for a fountain, like the colossal mask of\r\nmarble out of the mouth of which a jet of water falls into a fountain\r\nin the Via de Mascherone, called after it, near the Farnese Palace,\r\nand the marble mask which belongs to a small fountain on the opposite\r\nside of the river near the Palazzo Salviati. But the question arises,\r\nWhy should the Bocca della Verita, if such was its origin, have been\r\nused for the superstitious purpose connected with it? Our answer to\r\nthis question must lead us back to the Temple of Ceres and Proserpine\r\nwhich originally stood on the site of the church of Sta. Maria in\r\nCosmedin, and of the materials of which the Christian edifice was\r\nlargely built.\r\n\r\nIn primitive times the worship of clefts in rocks, holes in the earth,\r\nor stones having a natural or artificial perforation, appears to have\r\nbeen almost universal. We find traces of it in almost every country,\r\nand amongst almost every people. These sacred chasms or holes were\r\nregarded as emblems of the celestial mother, and persons went into\r\nthem and came out again, so as to be born anew, or squeezed themselves\r\nthrough the holes in order to obtain the remission of their sins. In\r\nancient Palestine this form of idolatry was known as the worship of\r\nBaal-perazim, or Baal of the clefts or breaches. David obtained a\r\nsignal victory over the Philistines at one of the shrines of this god,\r\nand burnt there the images peculiar to this mode of worship which the\r\nenemy had left behind in its flight. About two miles from Bombay there\r\nis a rock on the promontory of the Malabar Hill, which has a natural\r\ncrevice, communicating with a cavity below, and opening upon the sea.\r\nThis crevice is too narrow for corpulent persons to squeeze through,\r\nbut it is constantly resorted to for purposes of moral purification.\r\nThrough natural or artificial caverns in India pilgrims enter at the\r\nsouth side, and make their exit at the northern, as was anciently the\r\ncustom in the Mithraic mysteries. Those who pass through such caves\r\nare considered to receive by this action a new birth of the soul.\r\nAccording to the same idea the rulers of Travancore, who are Nairs by\r\ncaste, are made into Brahmins when they ascend the throne by passing\r\nthrough a hole in a large golden image of a cow or lotus flower, which\r\nthen becomes the property of the Brahmin priests. It is possible that\r\nthere may be an allusion to this primitive custom in the rule of the\r\nJewish Temple, mentioned by Ezekiel,--\"He that entereth in by the way\r\nof the north gate to worship shall go out by the way of the south\r\ngate; and he that entereth by the way of the south gate shall go forth\r\nby the way of the north gate: he shall not return by the way of the\r\ngate whereby he came in, but shall go forth over against it.\" This\r\narrangement may have been made not as a mere matter of convenience,\r\nbut as a survival of the old practice of \"passing through\" a sacred\r\ncave or crevice for the forgiveness of sins;--a survival purified and\r\nennobled in the service of God.\r\n\r\nThe oldest of all religious monuments of which we have any existing\r\ntrace are cromlechs, found mostly in waste, uncultivated places. These\r\nare of various forms, but they are mostly tripods, consisting of a\r\ncopestone poised upon three other stones, two at the head and one at\r\nthe foot. The supports are rough boulders, the largest masses of stone\r\nthat could be found or moved; and the copestone is an enormous flat\r\nsquare block, often with cup-shaped hollows carved upon its surface.\r\nUnder this copestone there was a vacant space, varying in size from a\r\nfoot or two to the height of a man on horseback. Through this vacant\r\nspace persons used to pass; and the narrower the space, the more\r\ndifficult the feat of crawling through, the more meritorious was the\r\nact. In our own country there are numerous relics of this primitive\r\ncustom. In Cornwall there are two holed stones, one called Tolven,\r\nsituated near St. Buryan, and the other called Men-an-tol, near\r\nMadron, which have been used within living memory for curing infirm\r\nchildren by passing them through the aperture. In the parish of\r\nMinchin Hampton, Gloucestershire, is a stone called Long Stone, seven\r\nor eight feet in height, having near the bottom of it a large\r\nperforation, through which, not many years since, children brought\r\nfrom a considerable distance were passed for the cure of measles and\r\nwhooping-cough. On the west side of the Island of Tyree in Scotland is\r\na rock with a crevice in it through which children were put when\r\nsuffering from various infantile diseases. In connection with the\r\nancient ruined church of St. Molaisse on the Island of Devenish in\r\nLoch Erne in Ireland, there is an artificially perforated stone,\r\nthrough which persons still pass, when the opening will admit, in\r\norder to be regenerated. If the hole be too small, they put the hand\r\nor the foot through it, and the effect is thus limited. Examples of\r\nsuch holed stones are to be found in some of the old churches of\r\nIreland, such as Castledermot, County Kildare; Kilmalkedar, County\r\nKerry; Kilbarry, near Tarmon Barry, on the Shannon. In Madras,\r\ndiseased children are passed under the lintels of doorways; and in\r\nrural parts of England they used to be passed through a cleft ash\r\ntree. At Maryhill, in the neighbourhood of Glasgow, about a year ago,\r\nwhen an epidemic of measles and whooping-cough was prevalent, two\r\nmothers took advantage, for the carrying out of this superstition, of\r\nthe presence in the village of an ass which drew the cart of a\r\ntravelling rag-gatherer. They stood one on each side of the animal.\r\nOne woman then took one of the children and passed it face downward\r\nthrough below the ass's belly to the other woman, who in turn handed\r\nit back with its face this time turned towards the sky. The process\r\nhaving been repeated three times, the child was taken away to the\r\nhouse, and then the second child was similarly treated. The mothers\r\nwere thoroughly satisfied that their children were the better of the\r\nmagic process.\r\n\r\nA mysterious virtue was supposed to be connected with passing under\r\nthe ancient gate of Mycenæ by the primitive race who constructed it.\r\nJacob's words at Bethel, \"This is the gate of heaven,\" may have an\r\nallusion to the prehistoric custom of the place; for we have reason\r\nto believe that a dolmen existed there, consecrated to solar worship,\r\nthe original name of Bethel being Beth-on, the house of the sun. The\r\nhollow space beneath the dolmen was considered the altar-gate leading\r\nto paradise, so that whosoever passed through it was certain to obtain\r\nnew life or immortality. It was an old superstition that the dead\r\nrequired to be brought out of the house not by the ordinary door of\r\nthe living, but by a breach made specially in the wall, in order that\r\nthey might thus pass through a species of purgatory. We find an\r\nexceedingly interesting example of this primitive superstition in the\r\npunishment that was imposed upon the survivor in the famous combat\r\nbetween the Horatii and Curiatii, when he murdered his sister, on\r\naccount of her unpatriotic devotion to her slain lover. The father of\r\nHoratius, after making a piacular sacrifice, erected a beam across the\r\nstreet leading from the Vicus Cyprius to the Carinæ, with an altar on\r\neach side--the one dedicated to Juno Sororia and the other to Janus\r\nCuriatius--and under this yoke he made his son pass with his head\r\nveiled. This beam long survived under the name of Tigillum Sororium or\r\nSister's Beam, and was constantly repaired at the public expense.\r\n\r\nIn modern times there are two most remarkable survivals of the same\r\nkind. One of them is in the corridor of the mosque of Aksa at\r\nJerusalem. In this place are two pillars, standing close together, and\r\nlike those in the mosque of Omar at Cairo, they are used as a test of\r\ncharacter. It is said that whosoever can squeeze himself between them\r\nis certain of paradise, and must be a good Moslem. The pillars have\r\nbeen worn thin by the friction of countless devotees. An iron bar has\r\nnow, however, been placed between the pillars by the present\r\nenlightened Pasha of Jerusalem to prevent the practice in future. The\r\nother instance is what is popularly known as \"threading the needle\" in\r\nthe Cathedral of Ripon. Beneath the central tower of this minster\r\nthere is a small crypt or vaulted cell entered from the nave by a\r\nnarrow passage. At the north side of this crypt there is an opening\r\nthirteen inches by eighteen, called St. Wilfred's needle. This passage\r\nwas formerly used as a test of character; for only an honest man, one\r\nnew-born, could pass through it. \"They pricked their credits who could\r\nnot thread the needle,\" was the quaint remark of old Fuller in\r\nreference to the original use of the opening. It may be remarked that\r\nthe well-known boys' game of \"Through the needle's e'e, boys,\" had its\r\norigin in all likelihood in the old superstition. Thus we can trace\r\nthe use made of the Bocca della Verita in Rome to the primitive\r\nidolatry associated perhaps with the Temple of Ceres that formerly\r\nstood on the spot.\r\n\r\nSome other superstitious practices of a closely allied nature may be\r\ntraced to the same source. In the Orkney Islands, not far from the\r\nfamous Standing Stones of Stennis, there is a single monolith with a\r\nlarge hole through it, which has become celebrated, owing to the\r\nallusion to it of Sir Walter Scott in his novel of the _Pirate_. It is\r\ncalled Odin's Stone; and till a very recent period it was the local\r\ncustom to take an oath by joining hands through the hole in it; and\r\nthis oath was considered even by the regular courts of Orkney as\r\npeculiarly solemn and binding; the person who violated it being\r\naccounted infamous and excluded from society. In the old churchyard of\r\nthe ruined monastery of Saints Island in the Shannon, there is an\r\nancient black marble flagstone called the \"Cremave\" or \"swearing\r\nstone.\" The saints are said to have made it a revealer of truth. Any\r\none suspected of falsehood is brought here, and if the accused swears\r\nfalsely the stone has the power to set a mark upon him and his family\r\nfor several generations. But if no mark appears he is known to be\r\ninnocent. Many other equally interesting instances might be quoted all\r\nakin to the superstition in Rome. It is not too fanciful to suppose\r\nthat even the Jewish mode of making a covenant had something to do\r\nwith this primitive custom. The animal offered in sacrifice was\r\ndivided into two pieces, and so arranged that a space was left\r\nbetween them. Through this space, between the parts, the contracting\r\npersons passed in order to ratify the covenant. We have a striking\r\naccount of this ceremony in the case of Abraham; and it is in allusion\r\nto it that the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews says that we have\r\nboldness to enter into the holiest \"by a new and living way, which he\r\nhath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh.\"\r\n\r\nThe superstitious practices connected with clefts and holed stones\r\nwere denounced by councils of the Christian Church, which subjected\r\ntransgressors to various penalties. Consequently this mode of worship\r\ncame into evil repute; and what was formerly considered a meritorious\r\naction, securing the cure of disease or future happiness, became a\r\ndeed of evil, to be followed by some calamity. For this reason the\r\nprimitive symbolism was reversed in many cases, such as \"passing under\r\na ladder,\" which is now considered unlucky; or in Eastern lands going\r\nbetween a wall and a pole, between two women or two dogs, which the\r\nTalmud forbids as an omen of evil.\r\n\r\nPassing from the subject of holed stones I proceed to consider another\r\nclass of interesting prehistoric objects that survive in the more\r\nprimitive churches of Rome. In the same church of Sta. Maria in\r\nCosmedin--where the Bocca della Verita which I have described\r\noccurs--there is a curious crypt called the chapel of St. Cyril, who\r\nundertook a mission about the year eight hundred and sixty to convert\r\nthe Slavs in Bulgaria to Christianity, and suffered martyrdom in the\r\nattempt. Beside an ancient altar of primitive construction on one side\r\nis preserved a large slab of granite on which St. Cyril is said to\r\nhave knelt when he was put to death; and half-sunk in the wall\r\nopposite are two large, smooth, dark-coloured stones, in shape not\r\nunlike curling stones--or an orange from which a portion has been\r\nsliced off horizontally. They cannot fail to be seen when attention is\r\ndirected to them.\r\n\r\nSuch stones, often made level at the top and bottom, and with a ring\r\ninserted in the upper surface, are not uncommon in the older churches\r\nof Rome, although they are very seldom noticed, as their significance\r\nis only known to a few experts. One is placed in the centre of the\r\nmiddle nave of Santa Sabina, on the Aventine, on the top of a short\r\nspirally-fluted column of white marble, which marks the spot where St.\r\nDominic, the founder of the order of the Dominicans, used to kneel\r\ndown and pray. It has received the name of Pietra di Paragone, or the\r\nTouchstone. Another may be seen at the entrance of the church of Santa\r\nPudenziana, on the Esquiline, supposed to have been built on the site\r\nof the house of the Roman senator Pudens, whose daughter, Pudentiana,\r\nSt. Peter is said to have converted to Christianity. A third exists\r\namong the extensive collection of relics belonging to the ten thousand\r\nthree hundred martyrs whose remains, according to tradition, were\r\ndeposited in the church of S. Prassede, at the beginning of the ninth\r\ncentury, by Paschal I. Two stones may be observed upon the gable wall\r\nimmediately above the basins of holy water in the interior of the\r\nchurch of S. Nicolo in Carcere, near the Ghetto. Two others are\r\ninserted in the wall of the Baptistery of St. John Lateran, between\r\nthe vestibule and the octagonal area containing the so-called gigantic\r\nfont in which Constantine was baptized. A very interesting stone hangs\r\nsuspended from the gilded iron grating which protects the crypt or\r\nconfessional of St. Laurence, immediately underneath the high altar of\r\nthe great Basilica of San Lorenzo beyond the Gate. A stone still more\r\nremarkable, guarded by a strong iron grating, projects half its bulk\r\nfrom the wall on the right-hand side of the arch which divides the\r\ntransept from the middle nave in the venerable church of Santa Maria\r\nin Trastevere. Two other stones may be seen in the quaint old church\r\nof SS. Cosma e Damiano at the south-eastern angle of the Roman Forum,\r\ncomposed of portions of three pagan temples. They are inserted in the\r\nplain whitewashed walls on both sides of the circular arch through\r\nwhich you pass from the round vestibule into the interior of the\r\nchurch. I have noticed similar stones in no less than twenty places\r\nbesides those I have mentioned; and I am assured that they may be seen\r\nin many more churches.\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to obtain any accurate or satisfactory\r\ninformation regarding these curious stones. They go by the name of\r\n_Lapides Martyrum_, or Martyr-stones. During the persecutions of the\r\nearly Christians in Rome they are said to have been hung round the\r\nnecks of those who were condemned to be drowned in the Tiber. In the\r\nreign of the emperor Diocletian many martyrs perished in this way, and\r\nthe stones by which they were sunk beneath the fatal waters, according\r\nto the popular idea, were afterwards found, and carefully preserved as\r\nholy relics in the churches in which they are now to be seen. Beyond\r\ndoubt they are genuine remains of antiquity, and some of them at least\r\nmay have been used for the purpose alleged; although we cannot be\r\nsure, in any case, that the story connected with particular stones is\r\nauthentic. St. Sabine desired that the stone which was to be tied to\r\nhim when thrown in the river should be buried with his body, and this\r\nmight have been done in the case of other martyrs. The stones in the\r\nchurch of SS. Cosma e Damiano are supposed to have been the very ones\r\nthat were fastened to the necks of these devoted Christians when they\r\nwere thrown into the Tiber in the reign of Maximian. But as the place\r\nand manner of their martyrdom are involved in hopeless obscurity, the\r\nvarious accounts given of both being contradictory, the ecclesiastical\r\nlegend has no weight. Cosma and Damian were Arabian doctors who were\r\nconverted to Christianity, and belonged to the class called\r\n\"silverless martyrs\"--that is, physicians who took no fee from those\r\nwhom they cured, but only stipulated that they should believe in\r\nChrist the Great Physician. They occupied in Christian hagiology the\r\nsame place as the ancient myth of Esculapius occupied in pagan\r\nmythology.\r\n\r\nAround the stone in the church of Santa Sabina a curious legend has\r\ngathered. The sacristan, a Dominican friar of the neighbouring\r\nconvent, is in the habit of telling the visitors that the devil one\r\nday, while St. Dominic was kneeling on the pavement as usual, hurled\r\nthe huge stone in question, with his utmost force, against the head of\r\nthe saint; but, strange to say, it either missed him altogether or\r\nfailed to do him any injury, the saint going calmly on with his\r\ndevotions as if nothing had happened. On the stone in the church of\r\nSanta Maria in Trastevere there is an inscription in Latin, informing\r\nus that it was fastened round the neck of St. Calixtus, the Bishop of\r\nRome, who, after having been scourged during an outbreak of pagan\r\nhostility, was thrown out of a window in his house in the Trastevere,\r\nand flung into a well. The stone in the Basilica of S. Lorenzo is\r\nconnected with the sufferings and death either of St. Justinian or of\r\nSt. Stephen, the proto-martyr, who was stoned to death in Palestine,\r\nand whose remains, miraculously recovered, are supposed to rest in the\r\ncrypt below, along with those of St. Laurence. All these relics are\r\ndevoutly worshipped, and they are believed to cure diseases, and to\r\nprotect against evil those who touch them.\r\n\r\nExamining the martyr-stones more closely, we find abundant evidence to\r\nconfirm the account which is usually given of their origin, viz. that\r\nthey were first used as Roman measures of weight. Several of them have\r\ninscribed upon their upper surface the names of the quæstors or\r\nprefects who issued them, as well as the number of pounds and ounces\r\nwhich they represented; the pounds being distinguished by figures, and\r\nthe ounces expressed by dots or small circles. Numbers of such ancient\r\nRoman weights of stone, similarly inscribed, may be seen in the\r\nKircherian Museum in the Collegio Romano. One specimen bears an\r\ninscription which signifies that, by the authority of Augustus, the\r\nweight was preserved in the temple of the goddess Ops, the wife of\r\nSaturn, and one of the most ancient deities of Italy, where the public\r\nmoney was deposited. Montfaucon, in the third volume of his learned\r\nand elaborate work on Antiquity, has a plate illustrating a number of\r\ncharacteristic specimens of these weights from the cabinet of St.\r\nGermain's. This previous use would lead us to suspect that all the\r\nstones in the Roman churches did not figure in scenes of martyrdom.\r\nSome of them, indeed, were found in the _loculi_ or graves of the\r\nCatacombs; but this circumstance of itself does not prove that the\r\nbody interred therein had been that of a martyr, and that the stone\r\nhad been employed in his execution. We know that the early Christians\r\nwere in the habit of depositing in the graves of their friends the\r\narticles that were most valued by them during life. And hence, in the\r\nCatacombs, a singular variety of objects have been found. Stone\r\nweights, therefore, may have been put into the graves of Christians,\r\nnot as instruments of suffering but as objects typical of the\r\noccupation of the departed in this life, in accordance with the habit\r\nof their pagan forefathers, which the Roman Christians had adopted.\r\nSome, however, of the stones, as I have said, may have been used\r\naccording to the popular legend for the drowning of martyrs; and these\r\nweights were conveniently at hand in places of public resort, and lent\r\nthemselves readily, by the rings inserted in many of them, to the\r\npersecutor's purpose.\r\n\r\nThe material of which they are composed is in nearly all cases the\r\nsame. It is a stone of extreme hardness and of various shades of\r\ncolour, from a light green to a dark olive, with a degree of\r\ntransparency equal to that of wax and susceptible of a fine polish. By\r\nsome writers it is called a black stone; but this colour may have been\r\ngiven to it by frequent handling when in use, and by the grime of age\r\nsince. It was called by the Romans, from the use made of it in\r\nfabricating measures of weight, _lapis æquipondus_, and from its\r\nsupposed efficacy in the cure of diseases of the kidneys _lapis\r\nnephriticus_. Fabreti says that it got the name of _lapis Lydius_ from\r\nthe locality from which it was believed to have come. It is a kind of\r\nnephrite or jade, a mineral which usually occurs in talcose or\r\nmagnesian rocks. At one time it was supposed to exist only on the\r\nriver Kara-Kash, in the Kuen Luen mountains north of Cashmere, and for\r\nthousands of years the mines of that locality were the only known\r\nworked ones of pure jade. It has since, however, been found in New\r\nZealand and in India; while the discoverers of South America obtained\r\nspecimens of it in its natural state from the natives of Peru, who\r\nused it for making axes and arrow-heads, and gave it the name of\r\n_piedra de yjada_, from which comes our common word _jade_, on account\r\nof its use as a supposed cure for the iliac passion. It may be\r\nmentioned that there is a mineral closely allied to jade called\r\n\"Saussurite,\" discovered by the great geologist whose name it bears\r\nnear Monte Rosa, and since found on the borders of the Lake of Geneva,\r\nnear Genoa, and in Corsica. It is possible that the martyr-stones may\r\nbe made of this mineral, for they have not been analysed. But if they\r\nare, as it is supposed, made of true jade, the fact opens up many\r\nimportant questions.\r\n\r\nNo stone has a more remarkable history. It is an object of interest\r\nalike to the geologist and the antiquarian; and in spite of the most\r\npatient inquiry its antecedents are surrounded with a mystery which\r\ncannot be satisfactorily solved. Its antiquity is beyond doubt. In the\r\nmost ancient books of China it is noticed as one of the articles of\r\ntribute paid to the emperor. Dr. Schliemann found it among the ruins\r\nof Troy. But its history stretches into the misty past far anterior in\r\ntime to all ordinary records, to Cyclopean constructions, or to\r\npictured and sculptured stones. One of the most curious things brought\r\nto light in connection with the prehistoric annals of our race is the\r\nwide diffusion of this mineral in regions as far apart as China and\r\nBritain. Owing to its extreme hardness and susceptibility to polish,\r\nit was highly prized by the neolithic races for the manufacture of\r\nstone axes and hammers. In nearly every European country implements of\r\njade belonging to the primitive inhabitants have been discovered. Some\r\nof the most beautiful belonged to one of the latest settlements of the\r\nstone age at Gerlafingen, in the Lake of Bienne, and were mixed with\r\nbronze celts of primitive type, indicating that the people of these\r\nlake-dwellings lived during the transition period between stone and\r\nbronze.\r\n\r\nThe presence of such celts made of jade obviously points to a\r\nconnection at a very early period with the East, from whence the stone\r\nmust have been brought, for it has never been found in a natural state\r\nwest of the Caspian. An interesting controversy upon this subject was\r\ncreated about eight years ago by the finding in the bed of the Rhone\r\nof a jade strigil, an instrument curved and hollowed like a spoon used\r\nto scrape the skin while bathing. Various conjectures were formed as\r\nto how this isolated object could have found its way from its distant\r\nquarry in the East to this obscure spot among the Alps. Professor Max\r\nMüller, and those who along with him advocate the Oriental origin of\r\nthe first settlers in Europe, are of opinion that this strigil and the\r\nvarious jade implements found in the Swiss lake-dwellings, are relics\r\nof this Western migration from the primitive cradle of the Aryan race\r\non the plateaus of Central Asia. The implements could only have come\r\nfrom the East, for the other sources of jade supply in New Zealand and\r\nAmerica--since discovered--were altogether unknown in those primitive\r\ntimes. And this conclusion is supported by an imposing array of\r\nconcurrent philological evidence, based upon the resemblances between\r\nthe Aryan languages of Europe, so strangely akin to each other, and\r\nthe ancient dialects of India and Persia. But plausible as this\r\nargument looks, the more probable explanation is that the inhabitants\r\nof Europe obtained the material which they laboriously fashioned into\r\ntools from the East, according to a system of barter similar to that\r\nwhich still exists amongst tribes more rude and savage than the Swiss\r\nlake-dwellers. Numerous facts of a like tendency are on record, such\r\nas the finding in the mounds of the Mississippi valley, side by side,\r\nobsidian from Mexico and mica from the Alleghanies, and in the mounds\r\naround the great northern lakes large tropical shells two thousand\r\nmiles from their native habitat. The ancient inhabitants of China and\r\nIndia found at a very early period that they possessed in their jade\r\nrocks a very valuable material, in exchange for which they could get\r\nwhat they wanted from the Western races; while these Western races had\r\nat least one article which they could barter for the much-prized jade\r\nimplements, viz. linen cloth, the weaving of which was practised in\r\nthe oldest settlements, hanks of unspun flax and thread, nets and\r\ncloth of the same material having been found not unfrequently in the\r\nlake dwellings.\r\n\r\nWhat an interesting glimpse into the far-off past does this link of\r\nconnection between the East and the West give us! It indicates a\r\ndegree of civilisation which we are not accustomed to associate with\r\nthese primeval times. Archæologists are of opinion that the race who\r\ninhabited Central Europe during the earlier part of the stone age were\r\nakin to the modern Laplanders. The people of the lake dwellings,\r\nhowever, and especially those who used jade implements, who replaced\r\nthem, were a superior and more civilised race. The evidence of the\r\narticles which they used, with the exception of jade itself, points\r\nnot to an Asiatic origin, but rather to a connection with the shores\r\non both sides of the Mediterranean. When they migrated northwards they\r\nbrought with them the flax and the cereals of Egypt, and introduced\r\nwith them the southern weeds which grew among these cultivated plants.\r\nThe seeds of the catch-fly of Crete, which does not grow in\r\nSwitzerland or Germany, have been found among the relics of the\r\nearliest of the lake dwellings; while the familiar corn blue-bottle\r\nof our autumn fields was first brought from its native Sicily by this\r\nlacustrine people in whose cultivated fields it grew as a weed, and by\r\nthem spread over all Western and Northern Europe. Such are the\r\ninteresting associations and profound problems connected with the\r\nmaterial of the martyr weights. And it is unique in this respect, that\r\nit meets us as far back as the first traces of neolithic man in\r\nCentral Europe--nay, farther back still, in the palæolithic flints\r\nfound in the caves near Mentone; and that it is still used in the\r\ncountries where it is found for a great variety of useful and\r\nornamental purposes, idols being carved out of it, and altars adorned\r\nwith its semi-transparent olive-green slabs. The inhabitants of the\r\nSouth Sea Islands until recently used it for their stone implements in\r\nthe same way that the ancient lake dwellers did; and the Mogul\r\nemperors of Delhi set such a high value upon it on account of its\r\nsuperstitious virtues that they had it cut, jewelled, and enamelled\r\ninto the most exquisite forms.\r\n\r\nIn Rome the martyr weights, as relics of the stone age, afford a\r\ncurious example of a very primitive epoch projecting far into a\r\nhighly-civilised one. Stone weights continued in use long after bronze\r\nand iron implements were constructed, on account of the sacred\r\nassociations connected with them. Weights and measures were regarded\r\nby the Romans as invested with a peculiar religious significance; the\r\nstone of which the weights were composed was called from that\r\ncircumstance, or because of the occult qualities attributed to it,\r\n_lapis divinus_; and therefore there was a deep-seated prejudice,\r\nwhich reached down to the days of the highest splendour of the Empire,\r\nagainst the introduction of a new substance. This was the case with\r\nall articles used in religious ceremonies. As late as the period of\r\nSt. Paul's residence in Rome, and at the time of the first persecution\r\nof the Christians, ancient pagan rites were celebrated in the Forum,\r\nin which the use of metal was forbidden; and only stone hatchets\r\ncould be employed in slaughtering animals, and only earthen vessels\r\nused in carrying the significant parts of the sacrifices into the\r\ntemples. Treaties were also ratified by striking the victim offered on\r\nthe occasion with a flint hatchet. The ancient Egyptians, although\r\nusing iron and bronze for other objects, invariably used stone knives\r\nin preparing bodies for the process of embalming. The sacrifices which\r\nthe Mexicans offered to their idols at the time of the Spanish\r\nconquest were cut up by means of knives of obsidian, which they\r\nobtained from the lavas of their volcanoes. In the Bible we have\r\nseveral traces of the same universal custom. The Jews seem to have\r\nperformed the rite of circumcision with flint implements, for we read\r\nin Exodus that Zipporah, the wife of Moses, took a sharp stone for\r\nthat purpose; and the phrase translated \"sharp knives\" in Joshua v.\r\n2--\"At that time the Lord said unto Joshua, Make thee sharp knives,\r\nand circumcise again the children of Israel the second time\"--should\r\nbe translated, as in the marginal reference, _knives of flint_. To the\r\nsame ancient widespread habit may doubtless be referred the\r\nprohibition, mentioned in Exodus and Deuteronomy, against making an\r\naltar in any special place where God recorded His name, of hewn stone,\r\nor polluting it by lifting up any iron tool upon it. So strong is the\r\nconservative instinct in religion that to this very day the\r\nenlightened Brahmin of India will not use ordinary fire for sacred\r\npurposes, will not procure a fresh spark even from flint and steel,\r\nbut reverts to, or rather continues the primitive way of obtaining it\r\nby friction with a wooden drill. Everywhere innovations in religious\r\nworship are resisted with more or less reason or prejudice. The\r\ninstinct is universal, and has its good and its evil side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nST. ONOFRIO AND TASSO\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most romantic shrines of pilgrimage in Rome is the church\r\nof St. Onofrio. It is situated in the Trastevere, that portion of the\r\ncity beyond the Tiber whose inhabitants boast of their pure descent\r\nfrom the ancient Romans. A steep ascent on the slope of the Janiculum,\r\nthrough a somewhat squalid but picturesque street, and terminating in\r\na series of broad steps, leads up to it from the Porta di San Spirito,\r\nnot far from the Vatican. The ground here is open and stretches away,\r\nfree from buildings, to the walls of the city. The church has a simple\r\nold-fashioned appearance; its roof, walls, and small campanile are\r\npainted with the rusty gold of lichens that have sprung from the\r\nkisses of four centuries of rain and sun. It was erected in the reign\r\nof Pope Eugenius IV. by Nicolo da Forca Palena, an ancestor of that\r\nConte di Palena who was a great friend of Torquato Tasso at Naples. It\r\nwas dedicated to the Egyptian hermit Honuphrius, who for sixty years\r\nlived in a cave in the desert of Thebes, without seeing a human being\r\nor speaking a word, consorting with birds and beasts, and living upon\r\nroots and wild herbs. A subtle harmony is felt between the history of\r\nthe hermit and the character of this building raised in his honour. A\r\nspot more drowsy and secluded, more steeped in the dreams of the older\r\nages, is not to be found in the whole city. In front of the church\r\nthere is a long, narrow portico, supported by eight antique columns\r\nof the simplest construction, in all likelihood borrowed from some old\r\npagan temple. Under this portico is a beautiful fresco of the Madonna\r\nand Child by Domenichino. To the right are three lunettes, which\r\ncontain paintings by the same great master, representing the Baptism,\r\nTemptation, and Flagellation of St. Jerome. On the left of the arcade\r\nare portraits of the most prominent saints of the Hieronomyte order.\r\nExposed to the weather at first, these invaluable frescoes had faded\r\ninto mere spectres of pictures; but they are now protected from\r\nfurther injury by glass.\r\n\r\nUsually the church is closed, except in the early morning, and\r\nvisitors are admitted by the custode on ringing a door bell under the\r\nportico. The interior is dark and solemn, with much less gilding and\r\nmeretricious ornament than is usual in Roman churches. It contains, in\r\nthe side chapels, many objects of interest; frescoes and altar-pieces\r\nby Annibale Caracci, Pinturicchio, and Peruzzi; and splendid\r\nsepulchral monuments. Of the last the most conspicuous are the marble\r\ntomb of Alessandro Guidi, the Italian lyric poet, who died in 1712;\r\nand the simple cenotaph in the last chapel on the left of one of the\r\ntitular cardinals of the church, who died in 1849, the celebrated\r\nlinguist Mezzofante. But the tomb upon which the visitor will gaze\r\nwith deepest interest is that of Torquato Tasso, who died in the\r\nadjacent monastery in 1595. The chapel of St. Jerome, in which it is\r\nsituated, the first on the left as you enter, was restored by public\r\nsubscription in 1857, in a manner which does not reflect much credit\r\nupon the artistic taste of modern Rome. Previous to this the remains\r\nof the poet reposed for two hundred years in an obscure part of the\r\nchurch close to the door, indicated by a tablet. Above this spot there\r\nis a portrait of the time, which from an artistic point of view is\r\nvery poor, but is said to be a good likeness. Removed on the\r\nanniversary of his death, about thirty years ago, to the chapel of St.\r\nJerome, the poet's remains are now covered by a huge marble monument\r\nin the cinque-cento style, adorned by a bas-relief of his funeral and\r\na statue of him by Fabris. Whatever may be said regarding the artistic\r\nmerits of this monument, no one who has read the poet's immortal epic,\r\nand is conversant with the sad incidents of his life, can stand on the\r\nspot without being deeply moved.\r\n\r\nConnected with the church is a monastery dedicated to St. Jerome. In\r\none of the upper corridors is a beautiful arched fresco of the Madonna\r\nand Child, by Leonardo da Vinci, with the donor of the picture in\r\nprofile kneeling before her. The picture is surrounded by a frame of\r\nfruit and flowers on an enamelled ground. The soft, tender features of\r\nthe infant Jesus, and the quiet dignity and grace of the smiling\r\nMadonna, are so characteristic of the style of Leonardo da Vinci that\r\nthe picture would be at once referred to him by one who did not know\r\nits origin. The chamber where Tasso spent the last days of his life is\r\non the upper floor, and is the most conveniently situated in the whole\r\nbuilding. It is left very much in the same state as when he lived in\r\nit. The walls and ceiling are bare and whitewashed, without any\r\ndecoration. Here and there are several pale marks, indicating the\r\nplaces of objects that had been removed. In one part is painted on the\r\nplaster a false door partially open, behind which is seen the figure\r\nof Tasso about to enter; but every person of good taste must condemn\r\nthe melodramatic exhibition, and wish that he could obliterate it with\r\na daub of whitewash. The custode directed my attention to it with an\r\nair of great admiration, and could not understand the scowl with which\r\nI turned away my face. There are several most interesting relics of\r\nTasso preserved in this chamber--his table, with an inkstand of wood;\r\nhis great chair covered with Cordova leather, very aged and\r\nworn-looking; the belt which he wore; a small German cabinet; a large\r\nChina bowl, evidently an heirloom; a metal crucifix of singular\r\nworkmanship, given to him by Pope Clement VIII., which soothed his\r\ndying moments; several of his letters, and an autograph copy of\r\nverses. In one corner is the leaden coffin, much corroded, in which\r\nhis remains were originally deposited. On the table is a mask in\r\nreddish wax moulded from the dead face of the poet, and placed upon a\r\nplaster bust--a most fantastic combination. From this mask, which is\r\nan undoubted original, numerous copies have been taken, which are\r\nscattered throughout Europe. It is in consequence somewhat effaced,\r\nbut it still shows the characteristic features of the poet--the purity\r\nof the profile, the fineness of the mouth, and the spiritual beauty\r\nand fascinating expression of the whole face. But the incoherence of\r\nthe adaptation makes it painful to think that this is the best\r\nrepresentation of the poet we possess.\r\n\r\nThe extensive garden behind the convent combines a considerable\r\nvariety of natural features. The monks grow large quantities of\r\nlettuce and fennochio; and interspersed among the beds of vegetables\r\nare orange and other fruit trees, and little trellises of cane,\r\nwreathed with vines. A large tank is supplied with water from a spring\r\nwhose murmur gives a feeling of animation to the spot. The garden\r\nrises at the end into broken elevated ground showing the native rock\r\nthrough its grassy sides. A row of tall old cypresses crowns the\r\nridge--their fluted trunks gray with lichen-stains, and their deep\r\ngreen spires of foliage forming harp-strings on which the evening\r\nwinds discourse solemn music, as if the spirit of the poet haunted\r\nthem still. On one side are the picturesque ruins of a shrine\r\noverarching a fountain, now dry and choked up with weeds, and fringed\r\nwith ferns. Cyclamens--called by the Italians _viola pazze_, \"mad\r\nviolets\"--grow on its margin in glowing masses; sweet-scented violets\r\nin profusion perfume all the air; and a few Judas-trees, loaded with\r\ncrimson blossoms, without a single leaf to relieve the gorgeous\r\ncolour, serve as an admirable background, almost blending with the\r\nclouds on the low horizon. On the other side the hill slopes down in a\r\nseries of terraces to the crowded streets of the Trastevere, forming\r\na spacious out-door amphitheatre, in which the Arcadian Academy of\r\nRome used to hold its meetings during the summer months, and where St.\r\nFilippo Neri was wont to give those half-dramatic musical\r\nentertainments which, originating in the oratory of the religious\r\ncommunity established by him, are now known throughout the world as\r\noratorios. Between these two objects still stands the large torso of a\r\ntree which bears the name of \"Tasso's oak,\" because the poet's\r\nfavourite seat was under its shadow. It suffered much from the\r\nviolence of a thunderstorm in 1842, but numerous branches have since\r\nsprouted from the old trunk, and it now affords a capacious shade from\r\nthe noonday heat. It is a variety of the Valonia oak, with delicate,\r\ndowny, pale-green leaves, much serrated, and contrasts beautifully\r\nwith the dark green spires of the cypresses behind. The leaves at the\r\ntime of my visit had but recently unfolded, and exhibited all the\r\ndelicacy of tint and perfection of outline so characteristic of young\r\nfoliage. The garden was in the first fresh flush of spring--that\r\nidyllic season which, in Italy more than in any other land, realises\r\nthe glowing descriptions of the poets. Plucking a leafy twig from the\r\nbranches and a gray lichen from the trunk as mementoes of the place, I\r\nsat down on the mossy hole, and tried to bring back in imagination the\r\nhaunted past. Nature was renewing her old life; the same flowers still\r\ncovered the earth with their divine frescoes; but where was he whose\r\nspirit informed all the beauty and translated its mystic language into\r\nhuman words? The permanency of nature and the vanity of human life\r\nseemed here to acquire new significance.\r\n\r\nThe spot on which I sat commands one of the finest views of Rome and\r\nthe surrounding country. Down below to the left is the enormous group\r\nof buildings connected with St Peter's and the Vatican, whose yellow\r\ntravertine glows in the afternoon sun like dead gold. Beyond rise the\r\nsteep green slopes of Monte Mario, with vineyards and olive-groves\r\nnestling in its warm folds, crowned with the Villa Mellini beside the\r\n\"Turner pine,\" a familiar object in many of the great artist's\r\npictures. Stretching away in the direction of the old diligence road\r\nfrom Florence is a succession of gentle ridges and bluffs of volcanic\r\nrock covered with brushwood, among which you can trace the bold\r\nheadland of the citadel of Fidenæ, and the green lonely site of\r\nAntemnæ, and the plateau on which are the scanty remains of the almost\r\nmythical Etruscan city of Veii, the Troy of Italy. The view in this\r\ndirection is bounded by the advanced guard of the Sabine range, the\r\nblue peak of Soracte looking, as Lord Byron graphically says, like the\r\ncrest of a billow about to break. In front, at your feet, is the city,\r\nbroken up into the most picturesque masses by the irregularity of the\r\nground; here and there a brighter light glistening on some stately\r\ncampanile or cupola, and flashing back from the graceful columns of\r\nTrajan and Antonine. The Tiber flows between you and that wilderness\r\nof reddish-brown roofs cleaving the city in twain. For a brief space\r\nyou see it on both sides of the Bridge of Hadrian, overlooked by the\r\ngloomy mass of the Castle of St. Angelo, and then it hides itself\r\nunder the shadow of the Aventine Hill, and at last emerges beyond the\r\nwalls, to pursue its desolate way to the sea through one of the\r\nsaddest tracts of country in all the world. Away to the right, where\r\nthe mass of modern buildings ceases, the great shattered circle of the\r\nColosseum stands up against the sky, indicating by its presence where\r\nlie, unseen from this point of view, the ruins of the palaces of the\r\nCæsars and the Forum. Beyond the city stretches away the undulating\r\nbosom of the Campagna, bathed in a misty azure light; bridged over by\r\nthe weird, endless arches of the Claudian aqueduct, throwing long\r\nshadows before them in the westering sun. Worthy framework for such a\r\npicture, the noble semicircle of the Sabine Hills rises on the horizon\r\nto the left, terminating in the grand rugged peak of Monte Gennaro,\r\nwhose every cliff and scar are distinctly visible, and concealing in\r\nits bosom the romantic waterfalls of Tivoli and the lone ancestral\r\nfarm of Horace. On the right the crested Alban heights form the\r\nboundary, crowned on the summit with the white convent of Monte\r\nCavo--the ancient temple of Jupiter Latialis, up to which the Roman\r\nconsuls came to triumph when the Latin States were merged in the Roman\r\nCommonwealth--and bearing on their shoulders the sparkling, gem-like\r\ntowns of Frascati and Albano, with their thrilling memories of Cicero\r\nand Pompey; the whole range melting away into the blue vault of heaven\r\nin delicate gradations of pale pink and purple. In the wide gap\r\nbetween these ranges of hills--beyond the stone pines and ilex groves\r\nof Præneste--the far perspective is closed by a glorious vision of the\r\nsnow-crowned mountains of the Abruzzi, giving an air of alpine\r\ngrandeur to the view. And all this vast and varied landscape,\r\ncomprehending all glories of nature and art, all zones and climates,\r\nfrom the tropical aloes and palms of the Pincian Hill to the arctic\r\nsnows of the Apennines, is seen through air that acts upon the spirits\r\nlike wine, and gives the ideal beauty of a picture to the meanest\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nItalian poets share in the wonderful charm that belongs to everything\r\nconnected with their lovely land. They are seen, like the early Tuscan\r\npaintings, against a golden background of romance. Petrarch, Dante,\r\nAriosto, invested with this magic light, are themselves more\r\nattractive even than their poetic creations. But Torquato Tasso,\r\nperhaps, more than them all, appeals to our deepest feelings. No\r\nsadder or more romantic life than his can be found in the annals of\r\nliterature. He was one of those \"infanti perduti\" to whom life was one\r\nlong avenue of darkened days. In his temperament, in the character of\r\nhis genius, and in the story of his life, we can discern striking\r\nfeatures of resemblance between him and the wayward, sorrowful\r\nRousseau. Hercules, according to the old fable, \"was afflicted with\r\nmadness as a punishment for his being so near the gods;\" and the\r\nimaginativeness of a brain which had in it a fibre of insanity, near\r\nwhich genius often perilously lies, may be supposed to account for\r\nmuch that is strange and sad in his career. The place of his birth was\r\na fit cradle for a poet. On the edge of a bold cliff, overlooking the\r\nsea at Sorrento, is the Hotel Tasso, known to every traveller in that\r\nregion. Here, according to the voice of tradition, the immortal poet\r\nwas born on the 11th of March 1544, eleven years after the death of\r\nAriosto. It is said that the identical chamber in which the event took\r\nplace has since disappeared, owing to the portion of rock on which it\r\nstood having been undermined by the sea; and, as if to give\r\ncountenance to this, some of the existing apartments are perilously\r\npropped up on the very edge of the cliff by buttresses, which, giving\r\nway, would hurl the superstructure into the abyss. The original\r\nbuilding stood on the site of an ancient temple; and it is probable\r\nthat, with the exception of one of the bedrooms, which is said to have\r\nbeen Tasso's cabinet, the edifice retains none of the features which\r\nit possessed in the days of the poet.\r\n\r\nBut whatever changes may have taken place in the human habitation, the\r\nscenes of Nature around, from which he drew the inspirations of his\r\nyouthful genius, remain unchanged. Every feature of landscape\r\nloveliness is focussed in that matchless panorama. Behind is a range\r\nof wild mountains, whose many-shaped peaks and crags, clad with pine\r\nand olive, assume, as the day wears on, the golden and purple hues of\r\nthe sky--sloping down into the midst of vineyards and groves of\r\norange, myrtle, and all the luxuriant verdure which the warm sun of\r\nthe South calls forth, out of which gleam at frequent intervals\r\npicturesque villages and farms, which seem more the creation of Nature\r\nthan of Art. In front is a glorious view of the Bay of Naples, with\r\nthe enchanted isles of Capri and Ischia sleeping on its bosom, and the\r\nreflected images of domes and palaces all along its curving shores\r\n\"charming its blue waters;\" while dominating the whole horizon are\r\nthe snowy mountains of Campania, broken by the dark purple mass of\r\nVesuvius, rising up with gradual slope to its rounded cone, over which\r\nrests continually a column of flame or smoke, \"stimulating the\r\nimagination by its mystery and terror.\" Apart from its associations,\r\nthat landscape would have been one to gaze on entranced, and to dream\r\nof for years afterwards. But with its countless memories of all that\r\nis greatest and saddest in human history clinging to almost every\r\nobject, it is indeed one of the most impressive in the world. The land\r\nis the land of Magna Græcia. The sea is the sea of Homer and Pindar.\r\nNear at hand are the Isles of the Sirens, who allured Ulysses with\r\ntheir magic song; away in the dim distance are the wonderful Doric\r\ntemples of Pæstum, which go back to the mythical times of Jason and\r\nthe Argonauts. On the opposite shore is the tomb of Virgil, on the\r\nthreshold of the scenes which he loved to describe,--the Holy Land of\r\nPaganism, the Phlegræan Fields, with the terrible Avernus and the Cave\r\nof the Sibyl, and all the spots associated with the Pagan heaven and\r\nhell; and in the near neighbourhood Baiæ, with its awful memories of\r\nRoman luxury and cruelty, and Puteoli, with its inspiring associations\r\nof the Apostle Paul's visit, and the introduction of Christianity into\r\nItaly. Meet nurse for any poetic child, the place of his birth was\r\npeculiarly so for such a child as Tasso; and we can detect in the\r\nsubjects of his Muse in after years, the very themes which such a\r\nregion would naturally have suggested and inspired.\r\n\r\nThe age in which he was born was also eminently favourable for the\r\ndevelopment of the poetic faculty. By the wonderful discoveries of the\r\nstarry Galileo, man's intellectual vision was infinitely extended, and\r\nthe great fundamental idea of modern astronomy--infinite space peopled\r\nwith worlds like our own--was for the first time realised. It was an\r\nera of maritime enterprise; the world was circumnavigated, and new\r\nideas streamed in from each newly-visited region. It was\r\npre-eminently the period of art. Leonardo da Vinci and Raphael had\r\njust passed away, but Michael Angelo, Titian, Tintoretto, and Paul\r\nVeronese were still living, freeing men's spirits by the productions\r\nof their pencil from formal fancies and conventional fetters, and\r\nsending them back to the fresh teaching of Nature. The art of printing\r\nwas giving a new birth to letters, and the reformation of religion a\r\nnew growth to human thought. A new power had descended into the\r\nstagnant waters of European life, and imparted to them a wonderful\r\nenergy. Along with the revival of classical learning and the general\r\nquickening of men's minds, there was blended in the South of Europe a\r\nlingering love of romance and chivalry, and a strong religious\r\nfeeling, which had arisen out of the vigorous reaction of Roman\r\nCatholicism. Italy was at this time the acknowledged parent both of\r\nthe poetry and the general literature of Europe; and the immortal\r\nworks of Dante, Petrarch, and Ariosto had formed an almost perfect\r\nvernacular language in which the creations of genius could find\r\nfittest expression.\r\n\r\nBut Tasso was not only born in a poetic region and in a poetic age: he\r\nwas also the son of a poet. He inherited the divine faculty; he was\r\ncradled in poetry. His father, Bernardo, though he has been put into\r\nthe shade by his more gifted son, has claims of his own to be\r\nremembered by posterity. He occupies a high place in the well-defined\r\ngroup of the chivalric poets of Italy. His principal poem, the\r\n_Amadigi_, which was composed about the time of his son's birth,\r\nthough not published for sixteen years afterwards, treats in a hundred\r\ncantos the romantic history of Amadis of Gaul, and deals in giants,\r\nenchanted swords, prodigious wounds, and miraculous cures. Various\r\nestimates of this long poem have been formed by critics from the\r\nfavourable analysis of Ginguéné to the severe censure of Sismondi. But\r\nin spite of its lack of dramatic power, and the monotony of its\r\nimagery, the heat of his genius crystallising only a part of the\r\nsubstance of his work, there can be no question that the poem is\r\ndistinguished by a certain gravity and elevation of sentiment, which\r\nplaces it high above the romances of the older school, and brings it\r\nnear to the dignity of epic poetry. In this respect the _Amadigi_ may\r\nbe said to form an interesting transition from the irregular romance\r\nof Ariosto to the symmetrical epic of his own son. The son's poetic\r\npath was thus prepared, and the mould in which his immortal work was\r\ncast was formed by his father. The fortunes of the two poets read\r\nremarkably alike. They are marked by the same extraordinary\r\nvicissitudes, and the same general sadness and gloom.\r\n\r\nThe family of Tasso belonged to Bergamo, in the north of Italy, a\r\nregion which has given birth to several eminent men, among others to\r\nTiraboschi, the historian of Italian literature. It was originally\r\nnoble, and had large territorial possessions. One ancestor, Omodeo,\r\nwho lived in the year 1290, is worthy of special mention as the\r\ninventor of the system of postal communication, to which the world\r\nowes so much; and hence the family arms of a courier's horn and a\r\nbadger's skin--tasso being the Italian for badger--which the\r\npost-horses, down to within fifty years ago, wore upon their harness.\r\nIn the time of Bernardo, however, the fortunes of the family had\r\ndecayed, and the early days of the poet were passed in poverty.\r\nAdopted after the death of his parents by his father's brother, the\r\nBishop of Recanati, he was placed at school, where he soon acquired a\r\nwonderful familiarity with the Greek and Latin authors, then newly\r\nrestored to Europe. Highly cultivated, refined, and possessed of great\r\npersonal beauty, while manifesting at the same time a peculiar talent\r\nfor diplomacy, Bernardo speedily won his way to distinction. His first\r\nwork, which was a collection principally of love-poems, celebrating\r\nhis passion for the beautiful Genevra Malatesta, who belonged to the\r\nsame family as the ill-fated Parasina of Byron, attracted the\r\nattention of the reigning Prince of Salerno, Ferrante Sanseverino,\r\none of the chief patrons of literature in Italy, who thereupon engaged\r\nhim as his private secretary. At the court of this prince he met\r\nPorzia de' Rossi, a lady of noble birth, who was beautiful and\r\naccomplished, and possessed what was considered in those days a large\r\nfortune. After his marriage with this lady Bernardo and his bride\r\nretired to a villa which he had purchased at Sorrento, where he\r\nenjoyed for several years an exceptional share of domestic felicity,\r\nhis wife having proved a most devoted helpmeet to him.\r\n\r\nIn these propitious circumstances the infant that was destined\r\nafterwards to confer the greatest lustre upon the family name was\r\nborn. His father was absent at the time with the Prince of Salerno,\r\nwho had joined the Spanish army in the new war that had arisen between\r\nCharles V. and Francis I.; a war whose chivalrous and inspiring acts\r\nthe Marquis d'Azeglio made use of in 1866 in his romance of history,\r\n_Fieramosca_, to rouse again a spirit of independence in his\r\ncountrymen. A friend of his father, therefore, held the child at the\r\nbaptismal font, in the cathedral of Sorrento, where he received the\r\nname of Torquato--a name which his elder brother, who lived only a few\r\ndays, had previously borne. The treaty of Crepi, which concluded the\r\nwar between Charles V. and Francis I., in which the former was\r\nvictorious, allowed Bernardo Tasso to return home with his patron ten\r\nmonths after the birth of his son. By this treaty the French king, who\r\nhad previously assumed the title of King of Naples, resigned all\r\nclaims upon that State, and the inhabitants were henceforth subjected\r\nentirely to the dominion of the Spanish sovereigns of the house of\r\nAustria. The emperor, Charles V., appointed the Marquis de\r\nVillafranca, better known as Don Pedro de Toledo, to be Viceroy of\r\nNaples, who, like his despotic master, carried out his so-called\r\nreforms with a high hand, and interfered with the personal and\r\ndomestic affairs of the inhabitants, so that he speedily roused their\r\nresentment. Against the establishment of the Inquisition, which he set\r\nabout under the mask of zeal for religion, but in reality for the\r\nintimidation of the nobles, the whole city rose up in violent\r\nopposition. After having exhausted itself in a vain struggle with the\r\nviceroy, it resolved to petition the emperor, and commissioned the\r\nPrince of Salerno to plead its cause at the Court of Nuremberg. But in\r\nconsequence of being forestalled by the cunning Don Pedro, the prince,\r\nwhen he arrived, found the case prejudged, and all his arguments and\r\npleadings were of no avail. Disgusted with the failure of his errand,\r\nwith the coldness of his reception, and with other indignities which\r\nhe received at the hands of the emperor and his viceroy, he determined\r\nto abandon altogether the cause of Austria. Repairing to Venice, he\r\npublicly gave effect to his decision; whereupon Don Pedro, too glad to\r\nhave an opportunity of oppressing his personal enemy, declared the\r\nprince a rebel, confiscated his estates, and seized all his personal\r\nproperty. In the misfortunes of his patron Bernardo Tasso shared. He\r\ntoo was proscribed as a rebel; his property at Salerno was seized, and\r\nhis wife and children were transferred by the viceroy's orders to\r\nNaples, where her family resided, and where, under their cruel\r\ntreatment, instigated by the viceroy, she was deprived of her fortune,\r\nand virtually held a prisoner to the day of her death.\r\n\r\nSuch were the dark clouds that, after a brief gleam of the brightest\r\nprosperity, hung over the early years of Torquato Tasso. Deprived of\r\nthe care of a father who followed from court to court the varied\r\nfortunes of his benefactor, and in the company of a mother worse than\r\nwidowed, dependent upon the cold and niggardly charity of friends who\r\nwere either too timid or superstitious to oppose the patron of the\r\nInquisition, the child grew up in melancholy solitude, like an\r\netiolated plant that has been deprived of the sunshine. The original\r\nsadness and sensitiveness of his disposition was much increased by the\r\nfamily misfortunes. In his seventh year he was sent to a school in\r\nthe neighbourhood, opened by the Jesuits, who were at this time\r\nbeginning to exert a powerful influence upon society, principally on\r\naccount of their zeal in the cause of education. At this school he\r\nremained for three years, acquiring a wonderful knowledge of Latin and\r\nGreek, and manifesting such enthusiasm in his studies that he rose\r\nlong before day-break, and was so impatient to get to school that his\r\nmother was often obliged to send him away in the dark with a lantern.\r\nHere he showed the first symptoms of his genius for poetry and\r\nrhetoric, and gave public testimony to the deep religious feeling\r\nwhich he inherited from his parents, and which had been so carefully\r\ncultivated by his ecclesiastical masters, by joining the communion of\r\nthe Church. In his tenth year his father left the court of Henry III.\r\nof France, and settled in Rome, where he had apartments assigned him\r\nin the immense palace of Cardinal Hippolito of the house of Ferrara.\r\nThese apartments were furnished as handsomely as his impoverished\r\nresources allowed, in the hope that he might have his wife and\r\nchildren to live with him. But in spite of all his efforts and\r\nentreaties his wife was not allowed by her brothers to rejoin him;\r\nwhile his own position as an outlaw made it impossible for him to\r\nenter the kingdom of Naples to rescue her. The only concession he\r\ncould get from the authorities was permission for her to enter with\r\nher daughter Cornelia as pensioners among the nuns in the convent of\r\nSan Festo; and no sooner was this step taken than her friends openly\r\nseized her dowry, on the plea that it would otherwise belong to the\r\nconvent, as her husband's outlawry cancelled his claims to it. Her\r\nboy, of course, could not enter the convent with her; he was therefore\r\nsent to his father in Rome. The separation between mother and son, we\r\nare told, was most affecting. To her it was the climax of her trials;\r\nand, bowed down beneath the weight of her accumulated sufferings, she\r\nfell an easy victim to an attack of fever, which, in the short space\r\nof twenty-four hours, ended her wretched life. Upon Tasso the parting\r\nfrom a mother whom he was never to see again, and whose personal\r\nqualities and grievous trials had greatly endeared her to him,\r\nproduced an impression which even the great troubles of his after life\r\ncould never efface.\r\n\r\nWith a mind richly stored, notwithstanding his youthful age, with\r\nclassic lore, and quickened and made sensitive by a varied and\r\nsorrowful career, Torquato Tasso came to Rome. The first occasion of\r\nseeing the imperial city must have been exciting and awakening in a\r\nhigh degree to such a boy. He was leaving behind the passive\r\nsimplicity of the child, and had already a keen interest in the things\r\nennobled by history and cared for by grown-up men. This dawn of a\r\nhigher consciousness found a congenial sphere in the city of the soul.\r\nWith what absorbing eagerness his young mind would be drawn to the\r\nstudy of the immortal deeds, which were the inheritance of his race,\r\non the very spot where they were done. He would behold with his eyes\r\nthe glorious things of which he had heard. There would be much that\r\nwould shock and disappoint him when he came to be familiar with it.\r\nMany of the ancient monuments had been destroyed; and many of the\r\nancient sites, especially the Forum and the Palatine, were deserted\r\nwastes which had not yet yielded up their buried treasures of art to\r\nthe pick and spade of the antiquarian. The ravages inflicted by the\r\nferocious hordes of the Constable Bourbon in 1527 had not yet been\r\nobliterated by the restorations and repairs undertaken by Pope Paul\r\nIII. The city had lost much of its ancient glory, and had not yet\r\nexchanged its gloomy medieval aspect for that of modern civilisation.\r\nBut, in spite of every drawback, he could not sufficiently admire the\r\nbuildings and the sites which bore witness of all that was grandest in\r\nhuman history. Along with a young relative, Christopher Tasso, he\r\npursued his classical studies in the midst of all these stimulating\r\nassociations under the tutorship of Maurizio Cattaneo, the most\r\nlearned master in Italy. The companionship of a youth of his own age\r\ndid him a great deal of good. It satisfied his affections, it saved\r\nhim from the loneliness to which his father's ill-health at the time\r\nwould otherwise have consigned him, and it spurred him on to a\r\nhealthful exercise of his mental powers. For a short time he led a\r\ncomparatively happy life in Rome. His father's prospects had somewhat\r\nimproved. Cardinal Caraffa, who was a personal friend of his, ascended\r\nthe pontifical throne under the name of Paul IV.; and as they were on\r\nthe same political side, he hoped that his fortunes would now be\r\nretrieved. But this gleam of prosperity speedily vanished. The\r\nimperial enmity, which had been the cause of all his previous\r\nmisfortunes, continued to pursue him like a relentless fate. Philip\r\nII. of Spain and the Pope having quarrelled, the formidable Duke of\r\nAlba, the new Viceroy of Naples, invaded the Papal States, took Ostia\r\nand Tivoli, and threatened Rome itself. With extreme difficulty\r\nBernardo Tasso managed to make his escape to Ravenna, with nothing\r\nleft him but the manuscript of his _Amadigi_. In the meantime his son\r\nwas taken to his relatives at Bergamo. In this city, under the shadow\r\nof the Alps, Torquato remained for a year in the home of his Roman\r\nschoolfellow. The inhabitants have ever since cherished with pride the\r\nconnection of the Tassos with their town, and have erected a splendid\r\nmonument to Torquato in the market-place. The exquisite scenery in the\r\nneighbourhood had a wonderful effect upon the mind of the youthful\r\npoet. It put the finishing touch to his varied education. The snows of\r\nthe North and the fires of the South, the wild grandeur of the\r\nmountains and the soft beauty of the sea, the solitudes of Nature\r\nwhere only the effects of storm and sunshine are chronicled, and the\r\ncrowded scenes of the most inspiring events in human history, had\r\ntheir share in moulding his temperament and colouring his poetry.\r\n\r\nFrom Bergamo Torquato was summoned to Pesaro, since known as the\r\nbirthplace of Rossini, hence called the \"Swan of Pesaro.\" His father\r\nhad found a home with the Duke of Urbino, who treated him with the\r\nutmost kindness. In the Villa Barachetto, on the shores of the\r\nAdriatic, surrounded by the most beautiful scenery and by the finest\r\ntreasures of art, which have long since been transferred to Paris and\r\nRome, Bernardo Tasso at last completed his _Amadigi_; while,\r\ncaptivated by his grace and intelligence, the duke made Torquato the\r\ncompanion of his son, Francesco Maria, in all his studies and\r\namusements. For two years father and son enjoyed in this place a\r\ngrateful repose from the buffetings of fortune. But, fired by\r\nambition, Bernardo left Pesaro for Venice, in order to see his poem\r\nthrough the press of Aldus Manutius; and being not only welcomed with\r\nopen arms by his literary friends in that city, but also appointed\r\nsecretary of the great Venetian Academy \"Della Fama,\" with a handsome\r\nsalary, he sent for his son, took a house in a good situation, and\r\nresolved to settle down in the place. There was much to captivate the\r\nimagination of the youthful Torquato in this wonderful city of the\r\nsea, then in the zenith of its fame, surpassing all the capitals of\r\ntransalpine Europe in the extent of its commerce, in refinement of\r\nmanners, and in the cultivation of learning and the arts. Its romantic\r\nsituation, its weird history, its splendid palaces, its silent\r\nwater-ways, its stirring commerce, its inspiring arts, must have\r\nkindled all the enthusiasm of his nature. But he did not yield himself\r\nup to the siren attractions of the place, and muse in idleness upon\r\nits varied charms. On the contrary, the time that he spent in Venice\r\nwas the busiest of his life. He was absorbed in the study of Dante and\r\nPetrarch; and the results of his devotion may still be seen in the\r\nnumerous annotations in his handwriting in the copies of these poets\r\nwhich belonged to him, now preserved in the Vatican Library in Rome\r\nand the Laurentian Library in Florence. He was also employed by his\r\nfather in transcribing for the press considerable portions of his\r\npoetical works; and these studies and exercises were of much use to\r\nhim in enabling him to form a graphic and elegant literary style. His\r\nown compositions, both in prose and verse, were by this time pretty\r\nnumerous, though nothing of his had found its way into print as yet.\r\n\r\nHis father saw with much concern the development of his son's genius.\r\nAnxious to save him from the trials which he himself had experienced\r\nin his literary career, he sent him to the University of Padua to\r\nstudy law, which he thought would be a surer provision for his future\r\nlife than a devotion to the Muses. One great branch of law, that which\r\nrelates to ecclesiastical jurisprudence, has always been much esteemed\r\nin Italy, and the study of it, in many instances, has paved the way to\r\nhigh honours. Almost all the eminent poets of Italy, Petrarch,\r\nAriosto, Marino, Metastasio, spent their earlier years in this\r\npursuit; but, like Ovid and our own Milton, their nature rebelled\r\nagainst the bondage. They took greater pleasure in the study of the\r\nlaws for rhyme than in the study of the Pandects of Justinian or the\r\nDecretals of Isidore. It was so with Tasso. He attended faithfully the\r\nlectures of Guido Panciroli, although these were not compulsory, and\r\nwaited patiently at the University during the three years of residence\r\nwhich is required for a law degree. But all the time his mind was\r\noccupied with other thoughts than those connected with his law\r\nstudies. Still, uncongenial as they must have been to him, he could\r\nnot have attended for three years to such studies without\r\nunconsciously deriving much benefit from them. They must have\r\nimpressed upon him those ideas of order and logical arrangement which\r\nhe afterwards carried out in his writings, and which separate them so\r\nmarkedly from the confused, inconsistent license of the older\r\nliterature of Italy; and he could not have resided in the birthplace\r\nof Livy, in constant association with the highest minds of the time,\r\nas a member of a University then the most famous in Europe, numbering\r\nno less than ten thousand students from all parts of the world,\r\nwithout his intellectual life being greatly quickened.\r\n\r\nDuring ten months of enthusiastic work he produced his first great\r\npoem, which, considering his age--for he was then only in his\r\neighteenth year--and the short time occupied in its composition, is\r\none of the most remarkable efforts of genius. He called his poem\r\n_Rinaldo_, after the name of the knight whose romantic adventures it\r\ncelebrates--not the Rinaldo of the _Gerusalemme Liberata_, but the\r\nPaladin of whom so much is said in the poems of Boiardo and\r\nAriosto,--and dedicated it to Cardinal Lewis of Este, then one of the\r\nmost distinguished patrons of literature in Italy. It contains a\r\nbeautiful allusion to his father's genius as the source of his own\r\ninspiration. It abounds in the supernatural incidents and personified\r\nabstractions characteristic of the romantic school of poetry; and\r\nthough Galileo said of it that it reminded him of a picture formed of\r\ninlaid work, rather than of a painting in oil, it has nevertheless a\r\nunity of plot, a sustained interest, and a uniform elevation of style,\r\nwhich distinguishes it from all the poetry of the period. Our own\r\nSpenser has imbibed the spirit of some of its most beautiful passages;\r\nand several striking coincidences between his _Faerie Queen_ and the\r\n_Rinaldo_ can be traced, particularly in the account of the lion tamed\r\nby Clarillo, and the well-known incident of Una and the lion in\r\nSpenser. The poem of _Rinaldo_ will always be read with interest, as\r\nit strikes the keynote of Tasso's great epic, the _Gerusalemme\r\nLiberata_, many of the finest fictions of which were adopted with very\r\nlittle modification from the earlier work. His letter asking his\r\nfather's permission to publish it came at a very inopportune moment.\r\nBernardo was smarting just then under the disappointments connected\r\nwith the reception of his own poem, the _Amadigi_. It produced little\r\nimpression upon the general public; the copies which he distributed\r\namong the Italian nobles procured him nothing but conventional thanks\r\nand polite praise; while the magnificent edition which he prepared\r\nspecially for presentation to Philip II. of Spain, in the hope that he\r\nmight thereby be induced to interest himself in the restoration of his\r\nwife's property at Naples, was not even acknowledged. Wounded thus in\r\nhis deepest sensibilities, and bewailing the misfortunes of his\r\nliterary career, we need not wonder that he should have sent a reply\r\nperemptorily commanding his son to give up poetry and stick to the\r\nlaw. The young poet in his distress sought the intervention of some of\r\nhis father's literary friends, and through their mediation the destiny\r\nof Torquato Tasso and of Italian poetry was accomplished, and the poem\r\nof _Rinaldo_ was given to the world through the renowned press of the\r\nFranceschi of Venice. No sooner was it published than it achieved an\r\nextraordinary success, for Cervantes had not yet made this class of\r\nfiction for ever ridiculous.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding that the public were surfeited with romantic poetry,\r\nthe merits of this new work, constructed upon different principles and\r\ncarried out in an original style, were such that the literary schools\r\nwere carried by storm, and the young Tasso, or Tassino, as he was now\r\ncalled to distinguish him from his father, at once leapt into fame. So\r\ngreat was his reputation, that the newly-restored University of\r\nBologna invited him to reside there, so that it might share in the\r\ndistinction conferred by his name. In this magnificent seat of\r\nlearning he remained, enjoying the advantage of literary intercourse\r\nwith the great scholars who then occupied the chairs of the\r\nUniversity, until the publication of some anonymous pasquinades,\r\nreflecting severely upon the leading inhabitants, of which he was\r\nfalsely supposed to be the author. In his absence the Government\r\nofficials visited his rooms and seized his papers. The sensitive poet\r\nregarded this suspicion as a stain upon his honour, and the outrage he\r\nnever forgave. Shaking the dust from his shoes, he departed from\r\nBologna, and for some time led an unsettled life, enjoying the\r\ngenerous hospitality of the nobles whose names he had celebrated in\r\nhis _Rinaldo_. Returning at length to Padua, where he engaged in the\r\nstudy of Aristotle and Plato, and delivered three discourses on Heroic\r\nPoetry in the Academia degli Eterei, or the Ethereals--in which he\r\ndeveloped the whole theory of his poetical design--which were\r\nafterwards published, the office of Laureate at the court of Ferrara\r\nwas offered to him by Cardinal Lewis of Este, to whom, as I have said,\r\nhe had dedicated his _Rinaldo_.\r\n\r\nTorquato Tasso was now in the full bloom of opening manhood. He was\r\ndistinguished, like his father, for his personal beauty and grace,\r\nwith a high, noble forehead, deep gray melancholy eyes, regular\r\nwell-cut features, and hair of a light brown. He had the advantage of\r\nall the culture of his time. His manners were refined by familiar\r\nintercourse with the highest nobles of the land, and his mind richly\r\nfurnished, not only with the stores of classic literature, but also\r\nwith the literary treasures of his own country; while a residence,\r\nmore or less prolonged, in the most famous towns, and among the most\r\nromantic scenes of Italy, had widened his mental horizon and expanded\r\nhis sympathies. He had already mounted almost to the highest step of\r\nthe literary ladder. Nothing could exceed the tokens of respect with\r\nwhich he was everywhere received. But, in spite of all these\r\nadvantages, Tasso was now beginning to realise the shadows that\r\naccompany even the most splendid literary career. His own experience\r\nwas now confirming to him the truth of what his father had often\r\nsought to impress upon his mind,--that the favour of princes was\r\ncapricious, and that a life of dependence at a court was of all others\r\nthe most unsatisfactory. Constitutionally disposed to melancholy,\r\nirritable and sensitive to the last degree, he brooded over the\r\nfancied wrongs and slights which he had received; and at first he was\r\ndisposed to accept the advice of his father's friend, the well-known\r\nSperone, who strongly dissuaded him from going to the court of\r\nFerrara, painting the nature of the life he would lead there in the\r\nmost forbidding colours. It would have been well had he listened to\r\nthis wise counsel, strengthened as it was by his own better judgment;\r\nfor in that case he might have been spared the mortifications which\r\nmade the whole of his after life one continued martyrdom. But\r\nrecovering from a protracted illness, into which the agitation of his\r\nspirits threw him, when on a visit to his father at the court of the\r\nDuke of Mantua, he passed from the depths of despondency to the\r\nopposite extreme of eagerness, and, fired by ambition, he resolved to\r\nenter upon the path to distinction which now opened before him. And\r\nhere we come to the crisis of his life.\r\n\r\nIn the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries a state of things existed in\r\nItaly somewhat similar to that which existed in the Highlands of\r\nScotland in earlier times. Each Highland chief maintained an\r\nindependent court, and among his personal retainers a bard who should\r\ncelebrate his deeds was considered indispensable. So was it with the\r\nprinces of Italy. In their train was always found a man of letters\r\nwhose poetic Muse was dedicated to laureate duties, and was valued in\r\nproportion as it recorded the triumphs of the protecting court. For\r\nthis patronage of art and letters no court was more distinguished than\r\nthat of Ferrara.\r\n\r\n    \"Whoe'er in Italy is known to fame,\r\n    This lordly home as frequent guest can claim.\"\r\n\r\nThe family of Este was the most ancient and illustrious in Italy. The\r\nhouse of Brunswick, from which our own royal family is descended, was\r\na shoot from this parent stock. It intermarried with the principal\r\nreigning families of Europe. Leibnitz, Muratori, and our own great\r\nhistorian, Gibbon, have traced the lineage and chronicled the family\r\nincidents of this ducal house. Lucrezia Borgia and the Parasina of\r\nByron were members of it. For several generations the men and women\r\nwere remarkable for the curious contrasts of a violent character and\r\nthe pursuits of the arts of peace which they displayed. Poisonings,\r\nassassinations, adulteries, imprisonments for life, conspiracies, were\r\nby no means uncommon incidents in their tragical history. And yet\r\nunder their government Ferrara became the first really modern city in\r\nEurope, with well-built streets, a large population, and flourishing\r\ntrade, attracting wealthy settlers from all parts of Italy. Nearly all\r\nthe members of the reigning house were distinguished for their\r\npersonal attractions and their mental capacities. They were also\r\nnotorious for their love of display. We have books, such as the\r\n_Antiquities of the House of Este_ by Muratori, the _Chivalries of\r\nFerrara_, the _Borseid_, and the _Hecatommiti_ of Giraldi, which were\r\nwritten almost to order for the purpose of gratifying this vanity.\r\nBorso, the first duke, caused his portrait to be painted in a series\r\nof historical representations in one of his principal palaces;\r\nHercules I. kept the anniversary of his accession to the throne by a\r\nsplendid procession, which was compared to the festival of Corpus\r\nChristi; an Order, which had nothing in common with medieval chivalry,\r\ncalled the Order of the Golden Spur, was instituted by his court, and\r\nconferred upon those who reflected lustre by their deeds or their\r\nliterary gifts upon the house of Este; while, to crown all, we read at\r\nthis day on the tower of the cathedral of Ferrara the dedicatory\r\ninscription beginning with \"To the god Hercules II.,\" which the\r\ncomplaisant inhabitants had put there,--an apotheosis which reminds us\r\nof the worst slavery of imperial Rome under Caligula and Domitian.\r\nSome of the greatest names of Italy, such as Petrarch, Boiardo,\r\nAriosto, the wonderful prodigy Olympia Morata, and the celebrated\r\npoetess Vittoria Colonna--the friend of Michael Angelo--were connected\r\nwith this brilliant court. The well-known French poet Clement Marot\r\nfled to it to escape persecution in his native country. Calvin found a\r\nrefuge there for some months under the assumed name of Charles\r\nd'Heppeville, during which he converted the duchess to the reformed\r\nfaith. The father of Tasso visited it when it was at the height of its\r\nsplendour and renown. Hercules II., the then reigning prince, son of\r\nLucrezia Borgia, had earned a great reputation for his literary works\r\nand patronage of the fine arts; and his wife, the friend of Calvin,\r\nthe youngest daughter of Louis XII. of France, was even more\r\nremarkable for her talents, being equally skilled in the Latin and\r\nGreek languages. This renowned couple drew around them a circle of the\r\nmost accomplished men and women in Europe, in whose congenial society\r\nBernardo Tasso spent a few months of great enjoyment, delighting all\r\nby his wit and social qualities.\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding all this magnificence and love of learning, the\r\nhouse of Este, among its other contradictory qualities, was\r\ndistinguished for capriciousness and meanness. Even Muratori, their\r\nardent panegyrist, does not attempt to conceal this blemish. We must\r\ndeduct a good deal from the high-sounding praise which the courtly\r\nwriters of Italy bestowed upon this house for its splendid patronage\r\nof literature, when we remember that Ariosto, who passed his life in\r\nits service, was treated with niggardliness and contempt. He had a\r\nplace assigned him among the musicians and jugglers, and was regarded\r\nas one of the common domestics of the establishment. Guarini, the\r\nwell-known author of the _Pastor Fido_, contemporary with Tasso, met\r\nwith much indignity in the service of Alphonso II.; while Panigarola\r\nand several other distinguished men were compelled to leave the\r\nservice of the ducal family by persecution. Benvenuto Cellini, who\r\nresided at the court of Ferrara twenty-five years before Tasso, gives\r\na very unfavourable account of the avarice and rapacity which\r\ncharacterised it; and Serassi, the biographer of Tasso, remarks that\r\nthe court seems to have been extremely dangerous, especially to\r\nliterary men. It was not therefore, we may suppose, without other\r\nreasons than his being merely a Guelph, that Dante in his _Inferno_\r\nplaced one of the scions of the house in hell, and uniformly regarded\r\nthe family with dislike. Tasso himself was destined to experience both\r\nthe favour and the hostility, the generosity and the neglect, of this\r\ncapricious house.\r\n\r\nFerrara is now a dull sleepy city of less than thirty thousand\r\ninhabitants. It is a place that continues to exist not because of its\r\nvitality, but by the mere force of habit. Its broad deserted streets\r\nand decaying palaces lie silent and sad in the drowsy noon sunshine,\r\nlike the aisles of a September forest. But in the days of Tasso it was\r\none of the gayest cities of Italy, which looked upon itself as the\r\ncentre of the world, and all beyond as mere margin. It was always\r\n_festa_, always carnival, in Ferrara; and when the poet came to it in\r\nhis twentieth year, on the last day of October 1565, he found it one\r\nbrilliant theatre. The reigning duke, Alphonso II., had just been\r\nmarried to the daughter of Ferdinand I., Emperor of Austria; and this\r\nsplendid alliance was celebrated by tournaments, balls, feasts, and\r\nother pageantry, which transcended everything of the kind that had\r\npreviously been seen in Italy, with the exception, perhaps, of the\r\nfêtes connected with the marriage of Lucrezia Borgia to his\r\ngrandfather. The ardent mind of the poet, it need hardly be said, was\r\ncompletely fascinated. He saw himself surrounded daily with all the\r\nsplendours of chivalry, and lived in the midst of scenes such as haunt\r\nthe dreams of poets and inspire the pages of romance. Goethe, in his\r\n_Torquato Tasso_, an exquisite poem, it may be said, but wanting in\r\ndramatic action, gives a vivid picture of the poet's life at the court\r\nof Ferrara, which bore some resemblance to his own at the court of\r\nWeimar.\r\n\r\nTwo sisters of the reigning prince lived in the palace, and by their\r\nbeauty and accomplishments imparted to the court an air of great\r\nrefinement. The younger, the famous Leonora of Este, was about thirty\r\nyears of age at this time, and therefore considerably older than\r\nTasso. A severe and protracted illness had shut her out from the\r\nfestivities connected with her brother's marriage, and communicated to\r\nher mind a touch of sadness, and to her features a spiritual delicacy\r\nwhich greatly increased her attractiveness. The numerous writers by\r\nwhom she is mentioned talk with rapture, not only of her beauty and\r\ngenius, but also of her saintly goodness, which was so great that a\r\nsingle prayer of hers on one occasion was said to have rescued Ferrara\r\nfrom the wrath of Heaven evinced in the inundation of the Po. In the\r\nsociety of these ladies Tasso spent a great deal of his time; and\r\nperhaps his intercourse with them, unconstrained by court\r\nconventionalities, was not altogether free from those tender feelings\r\nwhich the charms of a lovely and accomplished woman, whatever her\r\nrank, might readily excite in a poetic temperament. The author of the\r\n_Sorrows of Werther_ did not, therefore, perhaps draw exclusively upon\r\nhis imagination in picturing the rise and struggle of an unhappy\r\npassion for Leonora d'Este in the bosom of the young poet. Whatever\r\nmay be said regarding this passion, however, there can be no doubt\r\nthat his heart was at this time enslaved by younger and humbler\r\nbeauties. He had much of the temperament of his father, who, although\r\nexemplary in his single and married life, was distinguished for his\r\nPlatonic gallantry, and cherished a poetic attachment, according to\r\nthe fashion of the day, for various ladies throughout his career, such\r\nas Genevra Malatesta, the beautiful Tullia of Arragon, and Marguerite\r\nde Valois, sister of Henry III. These follies were but the froth of\r\nhis genius, however; and in this respect his son followed his example.\r\nLucrezia Bendidio, a young lady at court gifted with singular beauty\r\nand musical talent, reigned for a while supreme over his affections.\r\nBut she had other suitors, including the author of the _Pastor Fido_,\r\nand the poet Pigna, who was the secretary and favourite of the\r\nreigning duke. The Princess Leonora tried to cure Tasso of this\r\npassion by persuading him to illustrate the verses of his rival Pigna.\r\nNothing came of this first love, therefore, and the object of it soon\r\nafter married into the house of Machiavelli.\r\n\r\nIn the congenial atmosphere of the court of Ferrara, surrounded by the\r\nflower of beauty and chivalry, stimulated by the associations of his\r\nmaster Ariosto, which every object around recalled, and encouraged by\r\nthe praises of the sweetest lips in the palace, Tasso set himself\r\ndiligently to the composition of the great work of his life, the\r\n_Gerusalemme Liberata_, the plan of which he had formed before he left\r\nthe University of Padua. Among the treasures of the Vatican Library I\r\nhave seen a sketch in the poet's own handwriting of the first three\r\ncantos. This sketch he now modified and enlarged, and in the space of\r\na few months completed five entire cantos. He read the poem as it\r\nproceeded to the fair sisters of his patron, and received the benefit\r\nof their criticisms. This work, which is \"the great epic poem in the\r\nstrict sense of modern times,\" occupied altogether eighteen years of\r\nthe author's life. It was begun in extreme youth, and finished in\r\nmiddle age, and is a most remarkable example of a young man's devotion\r\nto one absorbing object. The opening chapters were written amid the\r\nbright dreams of youth, and in the happiest circumstances; the closing\r\nones were composed amid the dark clouds of a morbid melancholy, and\r\nduring an imprisonment tyrannical in all its features. Placed side by\r\nside with Homer and Virgil, it may be said with Voltaire that Tasso\r\nwas more fortunate than either of these immortals in the choice of his\r\nsubject. It was based, not upon tradition, but upon true history. It\r\nappealed not merely to the passions of love and ambition, but to the\r\ndeepest feelings of the soul, to faith in the unseen and eternal. To\r\nhumanity at large the wars of the Cross must be more interesting than\r\nthe wrath of Achilles, and the recovery of the Holy Sepulchre than the\r\nsiege of Troy. No theme could be more susceptible of poetic treatment\r\nthan the Crusades. They were full of stirring incident, of continually\r\nchanging objects and images. The strife took place amid scenes from\r\nwhich the most familiar stories of our childhood have come, and around\r\nwhich have gathered the most sacred associations of the heart. And\r\nTasso's mind was one that was peculiarly adapted to reflect all the\r\nspecial characteristics of the theme. It was deeply religious in its\r\ntone, and therefore could enter into the struggle with all the\r\nsympathy of real conviction. His luxuriant imagination was chastened\r\nby his classical culture; while the pervading melancholy of his\r\ntemperament gave to the scenes which he described an effect such as a\r\nthin veil of mist that comes and goes gives to a mountain landscape.\r\nThe gorgeous Oriental world of the palm tree and the camel, seen\r\nthrough this sad poetic haze, has all the shadows of the deep northern\r\nforests and the tender gloom of the western hills. The rigid outlines\r\nof history fade in it to the indefiniteness of fable, and fact becomes\r\nas flexible as fancy.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances of the times were also peculiarly favourable for the\r\ncomposition of such a poem. He was at the proper focal distance to\r\nappreciate the full interest of the Crusades, not too near to be\r\nabsorbed in observation and engrossed in the immediate results; not\r\ntoo far off to lose the sympathy for the religious chivalry which\r\ninspired the Holy War. Earlier, in the intensely prosaic period that\r\nimmediately succeeded, the romance of the Crusades was gone; later,\r\nEurope was girding itself for the sterner task of reformation. Before\r\nthe time of Tasso, Peter the Hermit would have been deemed a foolish\r\nenthusiast; later, he would have been sent to a lunatic asylum. But\r\njust at the time when Tasso wrote there was much, especially in Italy,\r\nof that spirit which roused and quickened Europe in the eleventh\r\ncentury, much that appealed to the natural poetry in the human heart.\r\nThe recent victory of the Christian forces at the famous battle of\r\nLepanto checked the spread of Mohammedanism in Eastern Europe, and\r\nturned men's thoughts back into the old channel of the Crusades; so\r\nthat Gregory XIII., who ascended the pontifical throne about the time\r\nthat Tasso had resumed the writing of his _Gerusalemme_, had actually\r\nplanned an expedition to the Holy Land, like that which his\r\npredecessor, Urban II., had sent out. And one of the principal events\r\nwhich the poet witnessed after his arrival at Ferrara, when the\r\nmarriage rejoicings were over, was the departure of the reigning duke\r\nwith a company of three hundred gentlemen of his court, arrayed in all\r\nthe pomp and splendour of the famous Paladins of the first Crusade, to\r\nassist the Emperor of Austria in repelling an invasion of the Turks\r\ninto Hungary. Many of the noble houses of Europe at this time were\r\nextremely anxious to trace their origin to the Crusades; and the\r\nvanity of the house of Este required that Tasso should make the great\r\nhero of his epic--the brave and chivalrous Rinaldo--an ancestor of\r\ntheir family. The scenes and associations, too, in the midst of which\r\nhis daily life was spent, helped him to realise vividly the pageantry\r\nconnected with the heroes of his epic.\r\n\r\nThus happy in the choice of a subject, and favoured by the spirit of\r\nthe time and the circumstances in which he was placed, Tasso gave\r\nhimself up to the composition of his poem with a most absorbing\r\ndevotion. Like Virgil, he first sketched out his work in prose, and on\r\nthis groundwork elaborated the charms of colouring and harmony which\r\ndistinguish the poem. So carefully did he study the military art of\r\nhis day that all his battles and contests are scientifically\r\ndescribed, and are in entire accordance with the most rigorous rules\r\nof war; and so thoroughly did he make himself acquainted with the\r\ntopography of the Holy Land by the aid of books, that Chateaubriand,\r\nwho read the _Gerusalemme_ under the walls of Jerusalem, was struck\r\nwith the fidelity of the local descriptions. Tasso occasionally sought\r\nrelief from his great task by the composition of sonnets and lyrics,\r\nwhich were published in the Rime of the Paduan Academy, and\r\ncontributed to make him still more popular all over Italy. He also\r\ntook part in those literary disputations in public which were\r\ncharacteristic of the age; and for three days in the Academy of\r\nFerrara, in the presence of the court, defended against both sexes\r\nfifty \"Amorous Conclusions\" which he had drawn up--a form of\r\ncontroversy which seems to have been a relic of the courts or\r\nparliaments of love, very popular in the twelfth and thirteenth\r\ncenturies. One of the ladies of the court impugned with success his\r\ntwenty-first conclusion \"that man loves more intensely and with more\r\nstability than woman;\" but whether this success was the result of the\r\ngoodness of her cause, and not rather of her own ability or of Tasso's\r\ngallantry, may be left an open question. He afterwards published the\r\nwhole series of the \"Amorous Conclusions,\" and dedicated them to\r\nGenevra Malatesta, who now, as an old married woman, was greatly\r\ntouched by receiving such a compliment from the son of her former\r\nlover.\r\n\r\nTasso's father was now dying at Ostiglia, a small place on the Po, of\r\nwhich the Duke of Mantua had made him governor. With talents\r\nunimpaired, at the age of seventy-six, and while preparing a new poem\r\nupon the episode of Floridante in the _Amadigi_, he was seized with\r\nhis last illness. His son, full of filial anxiety, hastened to see\r\nhim, and found the house in wretched disorder; the servants having\r\ntaken advantage of the helplessness of their master to neglect their\r\nduties and steal any valuable property they could lay their hands\r\nupon, so that Tasso had not only to take charge of the household\r\naffairs, but also to defray out of his own scanty resources the\r\ndomestic expenditure. After a month's severe struggle his father died\r\nin his arms, to the regret of all Italy, and his remains were interred\r\nwith great pomp by the Duke of Mantua in a marble cenotaph in the\r\nprincipal church of his capital, and were afterwards transferred by\r\nTasso to the church of St. Paul in Ferrara, where they now lie. Thus\r\npassed away one of the most conspicuous and unfortunate persons of his\r\nage, of whom it has been said that he was \"a politician, unlucky in\r\nthe choice of his party; a client, unlucky in the choice of his\r\npatrons; and a poet, unlucky in the choice of his theme.\"\r\n\r\nThe fatigue and sorrow connected with this bereavement brought on a\r\nsevere illness, from which Torquato recovered with a sense of\r\nloneliness and depression which only deepened as the years went on.\r\nFrom this melancholy he enjoyed, however, a temporary respite by a\r\nvisit to Paris. The house of Este by frequent intermarriages was\r\nconnected with the French court, in consequence of which they had a\r\nright to use the golden lilies of France in their armorial bearings;\r\nand many of the ecclesiastics of the family held rich benefices in\r\nthat country as well as in their own. Cardinal Lewis, the brother of\r\nthe reigning duke, resolved to inspect the abbeys that belonged to him\r\nin France, and to strengthen the Roman Catholic cause, which had\r\nreceived a severe blow from the Reformation; and among the gentlemen\r\nof his train he took with him Tasso, in order to introduce him to his\r\ncousin Charles IX., who himself dabbled in poetry and had a fine\r\nliterary taste. From the French monarch the poet obtained a gracious\r\nreception; and by the whole court he was warmly welcomed as one who\r\nhad worthily commemorated the gallant deeds of the Paladins of France\r\nat the siege of Jerusalem. For nearly a year he resided in different\r\nparts of France, and notwithstanding the numerous distractions of such\r\na novel mode of life, he added many admirable stanzas to his great\r\nepic, inspired by the very scenes among which his hero, Godfrey, and\r\nhis knights had lived. He left just in time to escape the dreadful\r\nmassacre of St. Bartholomew; but he may be said to have suffered\r\nindirectly on account of it. Though treated with distinction by the\r\nFrench court, his personal wants were left unsupplied, and his patron,\r\nCardinal Lewis, did not make up for this meanness. Voltaire,\r\ntherefore, had reason to indulge in a cynical sneer at the glowing\r\naccounts of his visit given by Italian writers; and Balzac's statement\r\nthat Tasso left France in the same suit of clothes that he brought\r\nwith him, after having worn it for a year, is not without foundation.\r\nThis shabby treatment, however, was part of a wider State policy. The\r\nyear of Tasso's residence in France was one of preparation for the\r\nmassacre of St. Bartholomew; but in order to avert the suspicions of\r\nthe intended victims, the Huguenots were treated with such\r\nextraordinary favour by the authorities that the Pope himself was\r\nincensed, and remonstrated with the King. Tasso, ignorant of the\r\ndreadful secret, spoke candidly and vehemently against the reformed\r\ndoctrines and those who professed them. His patron therefore simulated\r\ndeep indignation on account of this imprudence; and as the step fell\r\nin both with his personal avarice and his State policy, he broke off\r\nthe cordial relations that formerly existed between them.\r\n\r\nOn the return of Tasso to Ferrara he occupied himself for about two\r\nmonths with the composition of a pastoral drama called the _Aminta_.\r\nThis species of poem, which originated with Theocritus, who\r\nrepresented the shepherds of Sicily nearly as they were, and was\r\nimitated by Virgil, who idealised the shepherd life, was revived at\r\nthe court of Ferrara; and some years before a local poet wrote a\r\npastoral describing a romantic Arcadia, which was acted at the palace,\r\nand seems to have inspired Tasso with the idea of writing one too. But\r\nall previous pastorals--the _Sacrifizio_ of Beccari, the _Aretusa_ of\r\nLollio, the _Sfortunato_ of Argenti--were rough and incongruous\r\nmedleys compared with the finished production of Tasso, which may be\r\nsaid to mark an era in the history of dramatic poetry. Although Tasso\r\nhimself did not think much of it, and did not take any steps to\r\npublish it, the judgment of his contemporaries and of posterity has\r\nplaced it next in point of merit to the _Gerusalemme_; and by Italians\r\nit is especially admired for its graceful elegance of diction. Leigh\r\nHunt executed a very good translation of it, which he dedicated to\r\nKeats. Its choruses, which are so many \"lyrical voices floating in\r\nthe air,\" are very beautiful. It was designed for the theatre, and was\r\nacted with great splendour at the court of Ferrara, and a few years\r\nlater at Mantua, when the well-known artist and architect Buontalenti\r\npainted the scenery. This fact, however, shows how primitive was the\r\nstate of the theatre at this time; and how the spectators, little\r\naccustomed to histrionic representations, were content to witness\r\ndramas that had no plot or action, and to follow the progress of a\r\nbeautiful poem rather than a dramatic development. The _Aminta_ long\r\nretained its popularity as an acted poem in Italy. It was often\r\nrepresented in open-air theatres, like the ancient Greek plays, in\r\ngardens or in woods, where Nature supplied the scenery, and the\r\n_scalinata_ or stage was only some rising piece of ground. Traces of\r\none of these sylvan theatres may still be seen in the grounds of the\r\nVilla Madama, on the eastern slopes of Monte Mario near Rome; and one\r\ncannot help thinking that a poem so redolent of the open air, so full\r\nof Nature and still natural life, which Tasso himself called Favola\r\nBoschereccia, or a Sylvan Fable, was better adapted for such a stage\r\nthan for the heated air and artificial surroundings of the Italian\r\ntheatres. Such a pastoral was in entire keeping with the manners of\r\nthe Italian peasants; and the scenes of Arcadia which it represented\r\nmight be seen almost everywhere in the beautiful valleys and\r\nchestnut-covered hills of their native land. The exquisite loveliness\r\nof the climate, and the simplicity and indolence of the people, lent\r\nthemselves naturally to such ideal dreams. And Tasso in his _Aminta_\r\nonly gave expression to the same happy thoughts which the same scenery\r\nand the same people had ages before inspired in the mind of Virgil\r\nwhen he wrote his Eclogues.\r\n\r\nAfter a few months' quiet sojourn with Lucrezia d'Este, now Duchess of\r\nUrbino, at that court, he was appointed secretary to the Duke of\r\nFerrara, in room of his rival Pigna, who for this reason became his\r\nmortal enemy, and stirred up against him the persecution which\r\nembittered his whole subsequent life. But standing high, as he did, in\r\nthe favour of the duke, he enjoyed for a while a season of calm\r\nrepose, during which he finished the great epic poem, which was\r\neagerly looked for throughout Italy. Anxious to make this cherished\r\nwork of his genius as perfect as possible, he unfortunately was\r\nimprudent enough to submit portions of his work to all his learned\r\nfriends for their opinion. Besides in this way getting the most\r\ncontradictory advices, sacrificing his own independent judgment, and\r\nimposing an unworthy yoke upon his genius, the result was that the\r\nfragments of the poem passed from hand to hand, and so got into the\r\npossession of the printers, who, eager to profit by the public\r\ncuriosity, pieced them together, and clandestinely printed them. Even\r\nin this fragmentary form, the cantos that appeared in various cities\r\nof Italy were received with unbounded applause. The author, as may be\r\nimagined, was intensely annoyed at this wrong that had been done to\r\nhim, and wrote to the Pope, to the Republic of Genoa, and to all the\r\nItalian princes who had any authority in the case, to put a stop to\r\nthe publication of a work which had been circulated without his\r\nsanction, but in vain. Even the first complete edition, which was\r\nissued in 1581, seems to have been without his consent; for the author\r\ncomplains that he was compelled, by the surreptitious publication of\r\nparts of his poem, to finish the work in haste, and he wished for more\r\ntime to elaborate the plot and polish the style. In the later\r\neditions, no less than seven of which appeared the same year, Tasso\r\nseems to have been to some extent consulted; but it may be said that\r\nthe great epic was given to the world in the form in which we now have\r\nit, without the author's imprimatur, and without the benefit of his\r\nfinishing touches. But in spite of this disadvantage it took the whole\r\ncountry at once by storm. Two thousand copies were sold in two days.\r\nThroughout literary circles nothing else was spoken of. The exquisite\r\nstanzas, full of the true chivalric spirit, touched a responsive chord\r\nin every Italian bosom. Not only in the academies of the learned was\r\nthe poem discussed, not only was it recited before princes amid the\r\nsplendours of courts, but priests mused over it in the solitude of the\r\ncloister, and peasants chanted its sonorous strains as they worked in\r\nthe fields. Quotations from it, we are told, might be heard from the\r\ngondolier on the Grand Canal of Venice, as he greeted his neighbour in\r\npassing by, and from the brigand on the far heights of the Abruzzi, as\r\nhe lay in wait for the unsuspecting traveller; and \"a portion of the\r\nCrusader's Litany was a favourite chant of the galley-slaves of\r\nLeghorn, as, chained together, they dragged their weary steps along\r\nthe shore.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no book which it is easier to find fault with than the\r\n_Gerusalemme_ when estimated by the satiated critical spirit of modern\r\ntimes, which insists upon brevity, and demands in each line a certain\r\npoetic excellence; especially if the poem is known only through the\r\nmedium of a translation, which, however faithful, is but the turning\r\nof the wrong side of a piece of tapestry. We may object to the want of\r\noriginality in the leading characters, to the occasional inflated\r\nstyle, and the conceits and plays upon words now and then introduced,\r\nto the apparently disproportionate influence of love upon the action\r\nof the poem, as Hallam has remarked, giving it an effeminate tone,\r\nand, above all, to the introduction of so much supernatural machinery\r\nin the form of magic and demons; for such supernaturalism is out of\r\nkeeping altogether with our vaster knowledge of the universe, and our\r\nmore solemn ideas of Him who pervades it. But it is not by an analysis\r\nof particular parts, or a criticism of special peculiarities, that the\r\n_Gerusalemme_ should be judged. It is by its effect as a whole, as a\r\nhighly finished work of art. A single campaign of the first\r\ncrusade--that of 1099--embraces the whole action of the poem; but the\r\nnumerous episodes form each a perfect picture, that, like a flower\r\nfloating on a stream, and illumined by a special gleam of sunlight,\r\ndoes not interrupt the continuous flow of the narrative. In a state of\r\nsociety characterised by much corruption, the sentiments are uniformly\r\npure; and in an artificial age, when Nature was regarded as only the\r\nbackground of human action, the descriptions of the objects of Nature\r\nare wonderfully accurate; and the mind of the poet towards the flowers\r\nand trees, the woods and hills and streams, was in a childlike state,\r\nand had all the freshness and joyousness of childhood. The student is\r\nnot to be envied who can read without emotion the enthusiastic\r\ndescription of the Crusader's first sight of Jerusalem, the touching\r\npathos of Clorinda's death, and the sublime account of the ruins of\r\nCarthage. It would indeed refresh many a mind, surfeited by the vast\r\nmass of our modern literature, to go back to the green pastures and\r\nstill waters of this grand old poem.\r\n\r\nEvery visitor to Florence knows the venerable monastery of San Marco,\r\nwith its hallowed relics of Savonarola, and its beautiful frescoes of\r\nFra Angelico. In a large apartment of this monastery, which was\r\nformerly the library of the monks, are now held the meetings of the\r\nfamous Della Cruscan Academy, instituted in 1582 for the purpose of\r\npurifying the national language. At that time every town of the least\r\nimportance in Italy had its academy with some strange fantastic name,\r\nwhich was an important element in the intellectual life of the people,\r\nand exercised a critical control over the literature of the day. Up to\r\nthe year 1814 the Della Cruscans assembled in the Palazzo Riccardi,\r\nthe ancient palace of the Medici; but that stately building being\r\nrequired for Government purposes, the members have since been\r\naccommodated in San Marco, where they have sunk into obscurity, many\r\nof the inhabitants of Florence being altogether ignorant of the\r\nexistence of such an institution in their city. I had considerable\r\ndifficulty in finding out the locality. The furniture of the\r\napartment is exceedingly curious, and is meant to indicate the object\r\nof the Academy, which--as its name literally translated, _of the_ bran\r\nor _chaff_, signifies--is to sift the fine flour of the language from\r\nthe corrupt bran that has gathered around it. The chairs are made in\r\nimitation of a baker's basket, turned bottom upwards and painted red.\r\nOn the wall behind each chair is suspended a shovel, with the name of\r\nits owner painted upon it, along with a group of flowers in allusion\r\nto the famous motto of the Academy, \"Il più bel fior ne coglie,\" \"It\r\nplucks the fairest flower.\" On the table, during my visit, there was a\r\nmodel of a flour-dressing machine and some meal sacks; while several\r\nprinted sheets of a new edition of the Italian Dictionary, which the\r\nmembers were engaged in publishing at the time, with manuscript\r\ncorrections, were scattered about. At present the Academy, besides\r\ndoing this important work, occasionally holds public sessions; but it\r\nis an effete institution, that has little more than an archæological\r\ninterest. It was very different, however, in the sixteenth century.\r\nThen, in point of numbers and reputation, it was the outstanding\r\nliterary academy of Italy, and occupied the commanding position from\r\nwhich the all-powerful humanists of the previous age had been driven\r\nby the counter reformation. It is chiefly, however, by its attacks\r\nupon Tasso that it is now known to fame.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was the _Gerusalemme_ published than comparisons began to be\r\ninstituted between it and the _Orlando Furioso_ of Ariosto. This\r\nlatter poem was then in the zenith of its reputation; it was regarded\r\nas the supreme standard of literary excellence, and it was slavishly\r\nimitated by all the inferior poets of Italy. It was inevitable,\r\ntherefore, that the two works should be compared together. But as well\r\nmight the _Æneid_ of Virgil be compared with the _Metamorphoses_ of\r\nOvid. The _Orlando Furioso_ is a romantic poem in the manner of Ovid,\r\nwhereas the _Gerusalemme Liberata_ is an epic poem in the manner of\r\nHomer and Virgil. No Italian poet previous to Tasso had written an\r\nepic; and Tasso himself distinctly avowed that he had chosen that form\r\nof poetry deliberately; not only as being more congenial to his own\r\nmind, but also that he might avoid following in the steps of Ariosto,\r\nwhose work he regarded as, in its own department, incapable of being\r\nexcelled, or even equalled. In reply to the generous letter of\r\nAriosto's nephew, who wrote him a letter of congratulation, he said,\r\n\"The crown you would honour me with already adorns the head of the\r\npoet to whom you are related, from whence it would be as easy to\r\nsnatch it as to wrest the club from the hand of Hercules. I would no\r\nmore receive it from your hand than I would snatch it myself.\"\r\n\r\nBut in spite of the altogether different nature of the two poems, and\r\nin spite of the distinct disavowals of Tasso, the critics persisted in\r\naccusing him of the presumption of entering the lists with Ariosto.\r\nAnd in this idea they were strengthened by the injudicious praises of\r\nCamillo Pellegrini, who in a dialogue entitled _Caraffa_ or _Epic\r\nPoetry_, likened the _Orlando Furioso_ to a palace, the plan of which\r\nis defective, but which contains superb rooms splendidly adorned, and\r\nis therefore very captivating to the simple and ignorant; while the\r\n_Gerusalemme Liberata_ resembles a smaller palace, whose architecture\r\nis perfect, and whose rooms are suitable and elegant without being\r\ngaudy, delighting the true masters of art. This squib was published in\r\nFlorence, and at once aroused the hostility of the Della Cruscans.\r\nThey were already prejudiced against Tasso on account of his\r\nconnection with the court of Ferrara, between which and the court of\r\nFlorence there was a bitter rivalry; and that offence was intensified\r\nby the unguarded way in which he spoke of the Florentines as being\r\nunder the yoke of the Medici, whom he denounced as tyrants. The\r\nAcademy, which at the time enjoyed the patronage of the Grand Duke of\r\nTuscany, was therefore too glad to seize upon Pellegrini's squib as a\r\npretext for a vehement attack upon Tasso's epic. Ariosto was dead, had\r\npassed among the immortals, and was therefore beyond all envy; but\r\nhere was a _living_ poet, who belonged to a court which had cruelly\r\ntreated the daughter of their ruler, Lucrezia de Medici, the first\r\nwife of Alfonso of Ferrara, and was a mere youth, who was guilty of\r\nthe sacrilege of seeking to dethrone their favourite. Ariosto had\r\ngreatly admired Florence, and celebrated its beauties in one of his\r\nfinest poems; and was it to be borne that this young upstart, who had\r\npresumed to speak disparagingly of their city, should be preferred to\r\nhim? It would be a useless waste of time to go over in detail the\r\nabsurd criticisms by which they attempted to throw ridicule upon the\r\n_Gerusalemme Liberata_. They would have passed into utter oblivion had\r\nnot Tasso himself, by condescending to reply to them, given to them an\r\nimmortality of shame. Not contented with abusing his poem and himself,\r\nthey also attacked his father, asserting that his _Amadigi_ was a most\r\nmiserable work, and was pillaged wholesale from the writings of\r\nothers, and thus wounded the poet in the most tender part.\r\n\r\nBy this combination of critical cavils against him, Tasso was thrown\r\nback from the land of poetical vision into a dreary mental wilderness.\r\nThe effect upon one of his most sensitive nature, predisposed by\r\ntemperament and the vicissitudes of his life to profound melancholy,\r\nwas most disastrous. We can trace to this cause the commencement of\r\nthose mental disorders which, if they never reached actual insanity,\r\nbordered upon it, and darkened the rest of his life. His overwrought\r\nmind gave way to all kinds of morbid fancies. His body became\r\nenfeebled by the agitation of his mind; and the powerful medicines\r\nwhich he was prevailed upon to take to cure his troubles only\r\nincreased them. Like Rousseau during his sad visit to England, he\r\nbecame suspicious of every one, and lost faith even in himself.\r\nReligious doubts commenced to agitate his mind. Distracted by this\r\nworst of all evils, he put himself into the hands of the Holy\r\nFraternity at Bologna; and though the inquisitors had sense enough to\r\nsee that what he considered atheistical doubts were only the illusions\r\nof hypochondria, and tried to reassure him as to their belief in the\r\nsoundness of his faith, he was not satisfied with the absolution which\r\nthey had given to him.\r\n\r\nThe court of Ferrara was full of unscrupulous intriguers. Tasso's\r\nwonderful success could not be forgiven by some of the petty aspirants\r\nafter literary fame who haunted the ducal precincts. Pigna, whose\r\nplace as secretary he had usurped, stirred up the jealousy of the\r\nother courtiers into open persecution. Leonardo Salvinati, the leader\r\nof the Della Cruscan Academy, wishing to ingratiate himself with the\r\ncourt, joined in the hostility. Tasso's papers were stolen, and his\r\nletters intercepted and read, and a false construction was put upon\r\neverything he did. At first the duke refused to hear the various\r\naccusations that were brought against him, and continued to show him\r\nevery mark of esteem. He had the privilege, in that ceremonious age a\r\nvery high one, of dining daily with the prince at his own private\r\ntable. He accompanied the princesses to their country retreats at\r\nUrbino, Belriguarda, or Consandoli, where in healthy country pursuits\r\nhe forgot for a time his troubles. At Urbino he wrote the unfinished\r\ncanzone to the river Metauro, one of the most touching of his\r\ncompositions, in which he laments the wounds which fortune had\r\ninflicted upon him through the whole of his hapless life.\r\n\r\nBut the tenure of princely favour at Italian courts, amid so many\r\nambitious patrons and anxious suitors, was very precarious. It was\r\nuncommonly so at Ferrara. After a while a sudden change passed over\r\nthe mind of the duke towards Tasso. Whether tired of the poet's\r\nincessant complaints, irritated at his incautious conduct--going the\r\nlength on two occasions of drawing his sword, when provoked, upon\r\nmembers of the ducal household,--or whether his suspicions were\r\naroused regarding the relations between him and his sister Leonora, is\r\nnot known, but from this time he began to treat Tasso as if he were a\r\nmadman. He was placed under the charge of the ducal physicians and\r\nservants, who reported to their employer every careless word. Removed\r\nfrom Belriguarda, he was ordered to be confined in the Ferrarese\r\nconvent of San Francisco; and two friars were appointed to watch over\r\nhim continually. Such a life was unendurable to the proud poet, who\r\ndisliked the nauseous medicines of the convent as much as its\r\nrestraint; and taking advantage of a _festa_, when his keepers were\r\nunusually negligent, he made his escape by a window. In the disguise\r\nof a shepherd he travelled on foot over the mountains of the Abruzzi,\r\ngetting a morsel of bread and a lodging from the peasants by the way,\r\nto his sister's house at Sorrento, now the Vigna Sersale. There he\r\nremained during the whole summer, soothed by his sister's affectionate\r\nkindness. The monotony of the life, however, began to pall upon him,\r\nand he longed to get back to his old scenes of excitement. Undeterred\r\nby an evasive reply which the duke sent to an urgent letter of his, he\r\nset out for Ferrara; and on his arrival, meeting with a cold\r\nreception, he was obliged again to leave the place where he had once\r\nbeen so happy. For a year and a half he wandered over almost the whole\r\nof Northern Italy, visiting in turn Venice, Urbino, Mantua, Padua,\r\nRome, and Turin. At the last place he arrived without a passport, and\r\nin such a miserable condition that the guards at the gates of the city\r\nwould not have admitted him had he not been recognised by a Venetian\r\nprinter who happened to be present. His startled looks, his nervous\r\nmanner, and his perpetual restlessness, confirmed wherever he went the\r\nrumour of his madness; and, even if he were not mad, the object of\r\nAlfonso of Este's anger might be a dangerous associate. During all\r\nthis time he was in the greatest poverty, being obliged to sell for\r\nbread the splendid ruby and collar of gold which the Duchess of Urbino\r\nhad presented to him when he recited to her at her own court his\r\npastoral poem of _Aminta_.\r\n\r\nFrom the Duke of Urbino and Prince Charles Emanuel of Savoy, however,\r\nhe received generous treatment; but a fatal spell carried him back a\r\nthird time to Ferrara. His arrival by an unfortunate coincidence\r\nhappened to be on the very day that Margaret Gonzaga, daughter of the\r\nDuke of Mantua, was to come home as the third bride of Alfonso. The\r\nduke, preoccupied with the stately ceremonies connected with his\r\nnuptials, took no notice of him; and many of the courtiers from whom\r\nhe expected an affectionate welcome, taking their cue from their\r\nmaster, turned their backs upon him. What a contrast to his first\r\nreception at that court fourteen years before, when he stood among the\r\nnoble spectators of Alfonso's marriage with his first wife, the\r\nArchduchess of Austria, as one of the most honoured of the guests! He\r\nnow gazed upon the splendours of this third marriage ceremony, by far\r\nthe greatest poet of his age, but a homeless vagrant, a reputed\r\nmaniac, treated with neglect or contumely on every side! No wonder\r\nthat his cup of misery, which had previously been filled to the brim,\r\noverflowed with this last and crowning insult; and, scarce knowing\r\nwhat he did, he broke forth into the most vehement denunciations of\r\nthe duke and his whole court, declaring that they were all \"a gang of\r\npoltroons, ingrates, and scoundrels.\" These fiery reproaches, which\r\nhis misery had wrung from the poor poet, were carried by his enemies\r\nto the ear of the Duke, and Tasso was immediately seized and\r\nimprisoned as a lunatic in the hospital of Santa Anna in Ferrara--in\r\nthe same year and the same month, it may be mentioned, in which\r\nanother of the great epic poets of the world, Camoens, the author of\r\nthe _Lusiad_, finished as a pauper in an hospital his miserable\r\ncareer.\r\n\r\nWhile madness was alleged as the ostensible reason, the real motives\r\nof this step are involved in as deep a mystery as the cause of Ovid's\r\nbanishment to Tomi, on the Euxine. Muratori, the author of the\r\n_Antiquities of the House of Este_, says that he was confined\r\nprincipally in order that he might be cured; while the Abbate Serassi,\r\nwho wrote a life of the poet, attributes his imprisonment to his\r\ninsolence to the duke and his court, and to his desire, repeatedly\r\nexpressed and acted upon, to leave his patron's service. But both\r\nthese writers considered the interests of the house of Este more\r\nsacred than those of truth. The cause generally accepted is Tasso's\r\nsupposed attachment to Leonora, the sister of the duke. For a long\r\ntime he is said to have cherished this passion in secret, concealing\r\nit even from the object of it, although evidences of it may be found\r\nin some marked form or playful allusion in nearly all his poetical\r\nwritings; the episode of Olinda and Sophronia in the _Gerusalemme_,\r\nwhich he was urged in vain by his friends to withdraw on the ground of\r\nits irrelevancy, being intended to represent his own ill-fated love.\r\nOn one occasion, however, in a confiding mood, he told the secret to\r\none of the courtiers of Ferrara, whom he believed to be his devoted\r\nfriend. But what was thus whispered in the closet was proclaimed upon\r\nthe house-top; and a duel was the result, in which Tasso, as expert in\r\nthe use of the sword as of the pen, put to flight the cowardly traitor\r\nand his two brothers, whom he had brought with him to attack the poet.\r\nThis adventure, and the cause of it, reached the ears of the duke,\r\nwhose resentment was kindled by the audacity of a poor poet and\r\ndependant of his court in falling in love with a lady of royal birth.\r\nOn the strength of this suspicion his papers were seized, and all the\r\nsonnets, madrigals, and canzones that were supposed to give\r\ncountenance to it, confiscated. The manuscript of the _Gerusalemme_\r\nitself was retained, and a deaf ear was turned to the poet's\r\nentreaties for its restoration. Gibbon, in his _Antiquities of the\r\nHouse of Brunswick_, relates that one day at court, when the duke and\r\nhis sister Leonora were present, Tasso was so struck with the beauty\r\nof the princess, that, in a transport of passion, he approached and\r\nkissed her before all the assembly; whereupon the duke, gravely\r\nturning to his courtiers, expressed his regret that so great a man\r\nshould have been thus suddenly bereft of reason, and made the\r\ncircumstance the pretext for shutting him up in the madhouse of St.\r\nAnne. An abortive attempt was made to prove the attachment, about\r\nfifty years ago, by a certain Count Alberti, who published a\r\nmanuscript correspondence purporting to be between Tasso and Leonora,\r\nwhich he discovered in the library of the Falconieri Palace at Rome.\r\nThe alleged discovery excited an immense amount of interest in this\r\ncountry and on the Continent; but ere the edition was completed the\r\nauthor was accused of having forged the manuscripts in question, and\r\nwas condemned to the galleys.\r\n\r\nThe story of this hapless love is so romantic in itself, and has been\r\nmade the theme of so much pathetic poetry, that it would be almost a\r\npity to destroy by proof any foundation upon which it may rest. And\r\nyet it is difficult to agree with Professor Rosini, who has ably\r\ntreated the whole question in a work entitled _Amore de Tasso_, and\r\nhas come to the conclusion, after carefully weighing all the evidence,\r\nthat this was the rock upon which Tasso's life made shipwreck. On this\r\ntheory several circumstances are altogether inexplicable. We may\r\ndismiss at once the famous kiss as certainly a myth. Besides the\r\ndisparity of age, the ill-health, severe piety, and exalted rank of\r\nLeonora were formidable barriers in the way of Tasso's contracting a\r\npassion for her; and it is well known that the poet, who could not\r\nhave forgotten so soon a devoted love, did not offer a single tribute\r\nof regret to her memory when she died a few years afterwards. It is\r\nalso but too certain that Leonora left her supposed lover to languish\r\nin a dungeon without any reply to his pathetic complaints. The force\r\nof gravitation is a mutual thing; and just as the great sun himself\r\ncannot but bend a little in turn to the smallest orb that wheels\r\naround him, so the august Princess of Este could not but have regarded\r\nwith womanly interest a devoted admirer, however humble. The poetical\r\ngallantry of the day will account for all Tasso's lyrical effusions in\r\npraise of Leonora. They were in most instances simply the tributes\r\nthat were expected from the laureate of a court, especially a laureate\r\nwho was accused, with some show of reason, by the courtiers of\r\nFerrara, of an enthusiastic devotion to women, and of wasting his life\r\nwith the day-dreams of love and chivalry.\r\n\r\nRegarding the question of his madness, which was, as I have said, the\r\nostensible cause of his imprisonment, we are left in almost equal\r\nuncertainty. His morbid sensibility, irritated by the treatment which\r\nhe received alike from his friends and foes, his repeated complaints\r\nand occasional violences and extravagances of conduct, may have seemed\r\nto a selfish prince to border closely upon mental derangement. But his\r\nwhole conduct during his imprisonment, the nature of the numerous\r\nwritings which he produced during that dark period, forbid us to\r\nsuppose that his intellect ever crossed the line which separates\r\nreason from insanity. From out the gloom that surrounds the whole case\r\ntwo points stand out clear and indisputable, that no indiscretion of\r\nconduct or aberration of mind on the part of Tasso can possibly have\r\nmerited the sufferings to which he was subjected, and that whatever\r\nmay have been Alfonso's suspicions, his fiendish vengeance is one of\r\nhistory's darkest crimes, and covers the tyrant with everlasting\r\ndisgrace.\r\n\r\nThree objects attract the steps of the modern pilgrim in desolate\r\ngrass-grown Ferrara; the house, distinguished by a tablet, in which\r\nAriosto was born; the ancient castle in the centre of the town, in\r\nwhose courtyard Ugo and Parasina, whom Byron has immortalised, were\r\nbeheaded; and next door to the chief hotel--the Europa--and beside the\r\npost-office, the huge hospital of St. Anne, in which Tasso was\r\nconfined. This last object is by far the most interesting. The sight\r\nof it is not needed to sadden one more than the deserted streets\r\nthemselves do. The dungeon, indicated by a long inscription over the\r\ndoor, is below the ground-floor of the hospital; it is twelve feet\r\nlong, nine feet wide, and seven feet high, and the light penetrates\r\nthrough its grated windows from a small yard. By several authors,\r\nincluding Goethe, considerable doubts have been expressed regarding\r\nthe authenticity of this cell; and certainly the present features of\r\nthe place are not confirmatory of the tradition. This doubt, however,\r\nhas not prevented relic-hunters--among whom Shelley may be\r\nincluded--from carrying off in small fragments the whole of the\r\nbedstead that once stood there, as well as cutting off large pieces\r\nfrom the door which still survives. Lamartine wrote in pencil some\r\npoetical lines upon the wall; and Byron, with his intense realism,\r\ncaused himself to be locked for an hour in it, that he might be able\r\nto form some idea of the sufferings which he recorded in his _Lament\r\nof Tasso_.\r\n\r\nLess than sixty years ago the insane were treated with the utmost\r\ninhumanity as accursed of God; and the asylums in which they were shut\r\nup were dismal prisons, where the unfortunate inmates were left in a\r\nstate of the utmost filth, or were chained and lashed at the caprice\r\nof savage keepers. The madhouse which Hogarth drew will aid us in\r\nforming a conception of an Italian asylum in the sixteenth century,\r\nwhich was much worse than anything known in our country. The other\r\ninmates of the hospital of St. Anne suffered much doubtless; but they\r\nwere really mad, and were therefore unconscious of their misery. But\r\nthat alleviation was wanting in the case of Tasso. He was sane and\r\nconscious, and his sanity intensified the horror of his situation,\r\n\"enabling him to gauge with fearful accuracy the depths of the abyss\r\ninto which he had fallen.\" One glimpse of him is given to us by\r\nMontaigne, who visited the cell, where it seems the unfortunate inmate\r\nwas made a show of to all whom curiosity or pity attracted to the\r\nhospital. \"I had even more indignation than compassion when I saw him\r\nat Ferrara in so piteous a state--a living shadow of himself.\" His\r\njailer was Agostino Mosti, who, although he was himself a man of\r\nletters, and therefore should have sympathised with Tasso, on the\r\ncontrary carried out to the utmost the cruel commands of his prince,\r\nand by his harsh language and unceasing vigilance immensely aggravated\r\nthe sufferings of his victim. This inhuman persecution was caused by\r\nMosti's jealously of Tasso as the rival of his beloved master Ariosto,\r\nto whom at his own cost he had erected a monument in the church of the\r\nBenedictines at Ferrara.\r\n\r\nFor a whole year Tasso endured all the horrors of the sordid cell in\r\nwhich he was immured. After a while he was removed to a larger\r\napartment, in which he could walk about; and permission was granted to\r\nhim sometimes to leave the hospital for part of a day. But whatever\r\nalleviations he might thus have occasionally enjoyed, he was for seven\r\nlong years a prisoner in the asylum, tantalised by continual\r\nexpectations held out to him of approaching release. One person\r\nonly--the nephew of his churlish jailer--acted the part of the Good\r\nSamaritan towards him, cheered his solitude, wrote for him, and\r\ntransmitted the letters of complaint or entreaty which he addressed to\r\nhis friends, and which would otherwise have been suppressed or\r\nforwarded to his relentless enemy. His sufferings increased as the\r\nslow weary months passed on, so that we need not wonder that the last\r\nyears of his captivity should sometimes have been overclouded by\r\nvisions of a tormenting demon, of flames and frightful noises, with an\r\napparition of the Virgin and Child sent to comfort him. That he should\r\nhave been able to preserve the general balance of his mind at all in\r\ncircumstances sufficient to unseat the reason of most men, is a\r\nconvincing proof of the stability of his intellect, and his unshaken\r\ntrust in the God of the sorrowful. While we think of this protracted\r\ncruelty of the author of his imprisonment, it is some consolation to\r\nknow that he met with what we may well call a merited retribution.\r\nAlfonso, as Sir John Hobhouse tells us, in spite of his haughty\r\nsplendour, led an unhappy life, and was deserted in the hour of death\r\nby his courtiers, who suffered his body to be interred without even\r\nthe ceremonies that were paid to the meanest of his subjects. His last\r\nwishes were neglected; his will was cancelled. He was succeeded by the\r\ndescendant of a natural son of Alfonso I., the husband of Lucrezia\r\nBorgia; and he, falling under the displeasure of the Vatican, was\r\nexcommunicated; and Ferrara, having been claimed by Pope Clement VIII.\r\nas a vacant fief, passed away for ever from the house of Este.\r\n\r\n                              \"The link\r\n    Thou formest in his fortunes bids us think\r\n    Of thy poor malice, naming thee with scorn,\r\n    Alfonso! How thy ducal pageants shrink\r\n    From thee! if in another station born,\r\n    Scarce fit to be the slave of him thou mad'st to mourn.\"\r\n\r\nAt no period of his life was the mind of Tasso more active than during\r\nhis imprisonment. In the absence of all nourishment from the bright\r\nworld of Nature which he loved so passionately, his fancy could grow\r\nand keep itself leafy, like the cress-seed, which germinates and\r\nproduces its anti-scorbutic foliage on a bit of flannel moistened with\r\nwater, without any contact with soil or sunlight, in the long Arctic\r\nnight of the ice-bound ship. With the ravings of madmen ringing in his\r\nears, he composed some of the most beautiful of his writings, both in\r\nprose and verse. Among the manuscripts of the British Museum are\r\npreserved some of these writings, whose withered vellum pages we turn\r\nover with profound pity, as we think of the sad circumstances in which\r\nthey were composed. The most valuable of these is the manuscript of\r\nthe _Torrismondo_, in Tasso's own handwriting, and in the original\r\nparchment binding. This work was begun before his imprisonment, and it\r\nwas not finished until the year after his liberation; but the greater\r\npart of it was composed in the wretchedness of his cell at Ferrara.\r\nThe story upon which it is founded is a very harrowing one, a king of\r\nthe Ostrogoths marrying his own sister, mistaking her for a foreign\r\nprincess; but it is treated with very inadequate tragic power, and,\r\nlike the _Aminta_, displays no real action. Its beauty chiefly\r\nconsists in its choral odes on the vanity of all earthly things, which\r\nare exquisitely sad and touching. We hear in them the wild wail of the\r\npoet over his own misfortunes, and the vanishing of the dreams of\r\nglory which haloed his life. The chorus with which the tragedy winds\r\nup--\"Ahi! lagrime; Ahi! dolore\"--the words appropriately carved upon\r\nhis tombstone at St. Onofrio--is unspeakably pathetic. It is his own\r\ndirge, the cry of a heart whose strings are about to break. It is as\r\nuntranslatable as the sigh of the wind in a pine forest. If the words\r\nare changed, the spell is lost, and the way to the heart is missed.\r\n\r\nAt last the solicitations of the most powerful princes of Italy on\r\nTasso's behalf overcame the tenacity of Alfonso's will, and the victim\r\nwas released; but not till he had become so weak and ill that, if the\r\nimprisonment had continued a little longer, death would inevitably\r\nhave opened the door for him. When the order for his liberation had\r\nbeen obtained, his friends made known to him by slow degrees the glad\r\ntidings, lest a too sudden shock should prove fatal. He was now free\r\nto go wherever he pleased, and to behold the beauties of Nature, which\r\nhad been the mirage of his prison dreams; but the elasticity of his\r\nspirits was gone for ever; the bow had been too long bent to recover\r\nits original spring, and the memory of his sufferings haunted him\r\ncontinually, and cast a dark shadow over everything. He could not\r\naltogether shake off the fear that he was still in Alfonso's power,\r\nand wherever he went he fancied that an officer was in pursuit of him\r\nto drag him back to the foul prison in St. Anne's. A modern Italian\r\npoet, Aleardo Aleardi, has graphically described the feelings of the\r\ngentle poet-knight, roaming, pale and dishevelled, as a mendicant from\r\ndoor to door. But the sufferings that had thus maimed him bodily and\r\nmentally had spiritually ennobled him; and there is not a more\r\ntouching incident in all history than his entreaty to be allowed to\r\nkiss the hand of the cruel tyrant, as a last favour before leaving\r\nFerrara for ever, in token of his gratitude for the benefits conferred\r\nupon him in happier days,--a favour which Alfonso, to his eternal\r\ndisgrace, refused to grant.\r\n\r\nAt first Tasso took up his abode at the court of the Duke of Mantua,\r\nwhose son, Vincenzo Gonzaga, had been the principal instrument in his\r\nrelease, on the occasion of his marriage with the sister of Alfonso of\r\nFerrara. This Vincenzo Gonzaga is shown by the light of history in two\r\nopposite characters: as the generous friend and patron of Tasso, and\r\nas the pupil of the Admirable Crichton, who in a midnight brawl slew\r\nhis tutor in circumstances of the utmost baseness and treachery. For a\r\nwhile Tasso was treated with great kindness at Mantua, but, the father\r\ndying, the son no sooner ascended the ducal throne than, with the\r\ncapriciousness peculiar to Italian princes, he turned his back upon\r\nthe poet whom he had formerly befriended. The incident I have\r\nmentioned would have prepared us for this dastardly conduct; the evil\r\nside of his nature, which was kept in abeyance during his political\r\npupilage, assuming the predominance on his accession to power. Tasso's\r\nproud spirit could not endure the neglect of his once ardent friend,\r\nand he set out again into the cold inhospitable world, imploring in\r\nhis great poverty from a former patron the loan of ten scudi, to pay\r\nthe expenses of his journey to Rome. On the way he turned aside to\r\nmake a pilgrimage to Loretto, in order to satisfy that earnest\r\nreligious feeling which had been the inspiration of his genius, but\r\nthe bane of his life. The searching scrutinies and the solemn\r\nacquittals of the inquisitors of Bologna, Ferrara, and the great\r\ntribunal of Rome itself, had not satisfied his morbid mind. And he\r\nthought that he might get that peace of conscience which nothing else\r\ncould give by a visit to the Casa Santa--the house of the Virgin Mary\r\nat Loretto. Worn out by the long journey, which he made in the old\r\nfashion on foot, he knelt in prayer before the magnificent shrine; and\r\nthus, admitted as it were within the domestic enclosure of the holy\r\nhousehold, he felt that the Blessed Virgin had given him that calmness\r\nand repose of heart which he had not known since he had prayed as a\r\nboy beside his mother's knee. Strengthened by the successful\r\naccomplishment of his vow, he went on to Rome; but the stern Sixtus\r\nV., who was now upon the Papal throne, was too much occupied with the\r\narchitectural reconstruction of Rome, and with the suppression of\r\nbrigandage in the Papal States, to bestow any attention upon\r\nliterature; and Tasso had lost whatever energy he once possessed to\r\nassert his claims to recognition among the multitude of sycophants at\r\nthe Vatican.\r\n\r\nSick at heart, he left the imperial city, and directed his steps to\r\nNaples, in the hope that on the spot he might succeed in recovering\r\nhis father's possession and his mother's dowry. But here, too, the\r\nsame ill-fortune that had hitherto dogged his steps attended him. The\r\nlawsuit which he instituted, though it promised well at first, proved\r\na will-o'-the-wisp, which lured him into the bog of absolute penury.\r\nHis sister was dead; his mother's relatives, formerly hostile, were\r\nnow, because of the lawsuit, doubly embittered against him. In his\r\ndistress he sought refuge in the Benedictine monastery of Monte\r\nOliveto, which is now occupied by the offices of the Municipality of\r\nNaples, and the monastery garden converted into a market-place. Here,\r\nin one of the finest situations in Naples, commanding one of the\r\nloveliest views in the world, and in the congenial society of the\r\nmonks, his shattered health was recruited, and his mind tranquillised\r\nby the beauties of Nature and the exercises of religion. He repaid the\r\nkindness of his hosts by writing a poem on the origin of their Order,\r\nand by addressing to them one of his best sonnets. Among the visitors\r\nwho sought him out in this retreat was John Battista Manso, Marquis of\r\nVilla, who afterwards became his biographer. This accomplished\r\nnobleman, \"whose name the friendship and Latin hexameters of Milton\r\nhave rendered at once familiar and musical to English ears,\" was by\r\nfar the kindest and most consistent patron that Tasso ever met with.\r\nHe loaded him with presents, and showed him the most delicate and\r\nthoughtful attentions during Tasso's visit at his beautiful villa on\r\nthe seashore near Naples. He took him with him to his tower of\r\nBisaccio, where he remained all October and November, spending his\r\ndays, with great advantage to his health, in hunting, and his nights\r\nin music and dancing, taking special delight in the marvellous\r\nperformances of the improvisatori. Milton's acquaintance with Manso\r\nmay be regarded as one of the most fortunate incidents of his foreign\r\ntravels, inasmuch as his conversations about Tasso are supposed to\r\nhave suggested to him the design of writing an epic work like the\r\n_Gerusalemme_; and indeed Milton is supposed to have borrowed some of\r\nhis ideas for _Paradise Lost_ from the _Sette Giornate, or Seven Days\r\nof Creation_, a fragmentary poem in blank verse, which Tasso began\r\nunder the roof of his friend at Naples. This work is now very little\r\nknown, but it is worthy of being read, if only for the lofty dignity\r\nof its style, and the beauty of some of its descriptive parts,\r\nparticularly the creation of light on the first day, and of the\r\nfirmament on the second, and the episode of the Phoenix on the fifth.\r\nIts association with Milton's far grander work, as literary twins laid\r\nfor a while in the same cradle, will always invest it with deep\r\ninterest to the student.\r\n\r\nTasso occupied himself at the same time with an altered version of his\r\ngreat poem, which he called the _Gerusalemme Conquistata_. He was\r\ninduced to undertake this work in order to triumph over his truculent\r\ncritics, the Della Cruscans, who had condemned the former version. In\r\nthe Imperial Library at Vienna is preserved the manuscript of this\r\nversion, with its numerous alterations and erasures, showing how\r\nlaborious the task of remodelling must have been. He suppressed the\r\ntouching incident of Olinda and Sophronia. He changed the name of\r\nRinaldo to Riccardo; and ruthlessly swept his pen through all the\r\nflatteries, direct and indirect, which he had originally bestowed upon\r\nthe house of Este. There is hardly a single stanza that is not\r\nchanged. But in the process of revision he deprived his poem of all\r\nlife. Religious mysticism has been substituted for the refined\r\nchivalry of the Crusades, and poetry and romance have been sacrificed\r\nfor classical regularity and religious orthodoxy. To any one familiar\r\nwith the original, the _Conquistata_ must be regarded as the most\r\nmelancholy book in any language; a sad monument of a noble genius\r\nrobbed of its power and depressed by calamity. And it is all the more\r\nmelancholy that the author himself was utterly unconscious of its\r\ndefects, and got so enamoured of what he considered his improvements,\r\nthat he wrote and published a discourse called the _Giudizio_--a cold\r\npedantic work, in which he explained the principles upon which he made\r\nhis alterations. In vain, however, did the author thus commit literary\r\nsuicide. His immortal poem had passed beyond the reach of revision,\r\nand stamped itself too deeply upon the minds and hearts of his\r\ncountrymen to be effaced by any after version. And now the\r\n_Conquistata_ has sunk into well-merited oblivion, while the\r\n_Liberata_--\"his youthful poetical sin,\" as he himself called it--is\r\neverywhere admired as one of the great classics of the world.\r\n\r\nFor nine years Tasso lived after his imprisonment. But his free life\r\nwas only a little less burdensome than his prison one. With impaired\r\nhealth and extinguished hope, and only the wreck of his great\r\nintellect, he wandered a homeless pilgrim from court to court, drawn\r\nlike a moth to the brilliant flame that had wrought his ruin. Well\r\nwould it have been for him had he settled down to some quiet\r\nindependent pursuit that would have taken him away from the atmosphere\r\nof court life altogether, such as the Professorship of Poetry and\r\nEthics which had been offered to him by the Genoese Academy. But the\r\nhabits of a whole lifetime could not now be given up. His education\r\nand training had fitted him for no other mode of life. Without the\r\npatronage of the great, literature in those days had not a chance of\r\nsuccess; and a thousand incidents in the life of Tasso serve to show\r\nthat \"genius was considered the property, not of the individual, but\r\nof his patron\"; and with petty meanness was the reward allotted for\r\nthis appropriation dealt out. His experience of the favour of princes\r\nat this period was only a repetition of his own earlier one, and that\r\nof his father. His patrons, one after another, got tired of him; and\r\nyet he persisted in soliciting their favour. From the door of his\r\nformer friend, Cardinal Gonzaga, at Rome, he was turned away; and as a\r\nfever-stricken mendicant he sought refuge in the Bergamese Hospital of\r\nthat city, founded by a relative of his own, who little thought that\r\nit would one day afford an asylum to the most illustrious of his name.\r\n\r\nBut fate had now discharged its last evil arrow, and began to relent\r\nduring the two remaining years of his life. The sun that was all day\r\nobscured, as it struggled with dark clouds, emerged at last, and made\r\nthe western sky ablaze with splendour. All over the country nothing\r\nwas to be heard but the echoes of Tasso's praises. From the fountains\r\nof the Adige to the Straits of Messina, in the valleys of Savoy, and\r\nin the capitals of Spain and France, his immortal epic was read or\r\nrecited by the highest and the lowest. Fortunes were made by its sale.\r\nThe famous bandit Sciarra, who with his troop of robbers had terrified\r\nthe whole of Southern Italy, hearing that Tasso was at Gaeta, on his\r\njourney from Naples to Rome, sent to compliment him, and offer him,\r\nnot only a free passage, but protection by the way. At Florence,\r\nwhither he went at the invitation of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, the\r\nwhole literary society of the place, even including many of the Della\r\nCruscans, showered honours upon him. While at Rome Pope Clement VIII.\r\ngave him the most flattering reception, assigned to him an apartment\r\nin the Vatican, and an annual income of two hundred scudi. From the\r\nrepresentatives of his mother's friends at Naples he was also offered\r\nan annuity of two hundred ducats, and a considerable sum in hand, on\r\ncondition of stopping the lawsuit. Thus furnished with what he had\r\nvainly looked for all his life, the means of a comfortable\r\nsubsistence, his closing days promised a happiness to which he had\r\nhitherto been a stranger. But the gifts of fortune were brought to him\r\nwith sad auguries, like the soft sunny smiles of September skies,\r\nwhich gild the fading leaves with a mockery of May. Tasso came to Rome\r\nin November. But the state of his health was so deplorable that he\r\ncould not remain with safety in the room assigned to him in the\r\nVatican. It was thought, therefore, that the elevated position and\r\nsalubrious air, as well as the quiet life of the monastery of St.\r\nOnofrio, not far off on the same side of the Tiber, would be more\r\nsuitable for his restoration. Accordingly, Cardinal Cynthio\r\nAldobrandini, nephew of Clement VIII., who had befriended him on many\r\noccasions, brought him to St. Onofrio in his own carriage. And as his\r\nweary steps crossed the threshold, he said to the monks, who received\r\nhim with pitying looks, \"I come to die among you.\"\r\n\r\nWhenever he was able to go out, he spent the last days of his life in\r\nthe garden of the monastery. There he sat under the shadow of the aged\r\noak that has since become historical; and as he watched the sunset of\r\nhis life, he would gaze upon the mighty ruins and the glorious view\r\nstretching before him with that inspired vision which creates half the\r\nbeauty it beholds, and with that enhanced appreciation caused by the\r\nprospect of the coming darkness which would hide it for ever from his\r\nsight. We love to think of the poet in this quiet resting-place, where\r\nthe noises of the great world reached him only in subdued murmurs.\r\nHeaven was above him, and the world beneath. The memory of his wrongs\r\nand his ambitions alike vanished in the shadow cast before by his\r\napproaching death. Alfonso and Ferrara faded away upon the horizon of\r\neternity; even the fame of his _Gerusalemme_, the great object for\r\nwhich he had lived, had become utterly indifferent to him. In the\r\nmonastery of St. Onofrio, a bent, sorrow-stricken man, old before his\r\ntime, joining with the monks in the duties of religion, Tasso appeals\r\nmore powerfully to our feelings than when in the full flush of youth\r\nand happiness he shone the brightest star in the royal court of\r\nAlfonso.\r\n\r\nAwakening to the sense of the great loss that Italy was about to\r\nsustain in his death, his friends and admirers proposed that the Pope\r\nshould confer upon him at the Capitol the laurel wreath that had\r\ncrowned the brow of Petrarch. But the weather during the winter proved\r\nsingularly unpropitious for such a ceremony. Rain fell almost every\r\nday, and constant sirocco winds depressed the spirits of the people\r\nand prevented all outdoor enjoyments. And thus the season wore on till\r\nApril dawned with the promise of brighter skies, and the day was\r\nfixed, and all the _élite_ of Rome and of the chief cities of Italy\r\nwere invited to attend the coronation. Extensive preparations were\r\nmade; the whole city was in a flutter of excitement, and the people\r\nlooked forward to a holiday such as Rome had not seen since the days\r\nof the Cæsars. But by this time the poet was dying, fever-wasted, in\r\nhis lonely cell. He could see from his window, as he lay propped up\r\nwith pillows on his narrow couch, across the river and its broad\r\nvalley crowded with houses, the slender campanile of Michael Angelo\r\nascending from the Capitoline Hill, marking the spot where at the\r\nmoment the people were busy preparing for the magnificent ceremony of\r\nthe morrow. But not for him was the triumph; it came too late.\r\n\"Tomorrow,\" he said, \"I shall be beyond the reach of all earthly\r\nhonour.\" He received the last rites of the Church from the hands of\r\nthe diocesan, and passed quietly away with the unfinished sentence\r\nupon his lips, \"Into thy hands, O Lord,\" while the concluding strains\r\nof the vesper hymn were chanted by the monks. And they who came on the\r\nmorrow, to summon him to his coronation, found him in the sleep of\r\ndeath. The laurel wreath that was meant for his brow was laid upon his\r\ncoffin, as it was carried on the very day of his intended coronation,\r\nwith great pomp, cardinals and princes bearing up the pall, and\r\ndeposited in the neighbouring church of the monastery. Ever since, the\r\nanniversary of his death has been religiously kept by the monks of St.\r\nOnofrio. They throw open on that day, the 25th of April, the monastery\r\nand garden to the general public; ladies are freely admitted, and a\r\nfestival is observed, during which portions of the poet's writings are\r\nread, his relics exhibited, and his tomb wreathed with flowers.\r\n\r\nTasso died, like Virgil his model, in his fifty-first year. Short and\r\nchequered and full of trouble as was his life, it is amazing what an\r\nimmense amount of literary work he accomplished. Since the publication\r\nof his _Rinaldo_, in his seventeenth year, he never ceased writing,\r\neven in the most unfavourable circumstances. Of his prose and poetical\r\nworks no less than twenty-five volumes remain to us. These works are\r\nall rich in biographical materials. They show an ideal tenderness of\r\nfeeling, an intense love for everything beautiful, and a deep piety,\r\nnot only of sentiment but of duty. They are specially interesting to\r\nus as links connecting the ancient world with the modern. We can trace\r\nthe influence of Tasso's genius in very varied quarters. He not only\r\ngave a new impulse to the literature of his own country, but even\r\ninspired the artistic productions of the day. The most beautiful\r\npassages of Spenser's _Faerie Queen_ were suggested by his pastoral\r\npoetry; while his chivalrous epic was to Milton at once the incentive\r\nand the model of his own immortal work. It is probable that the _New\r\nHeloïse_ of Rousseau, and the tragedy of _Zaire_ by Voltaire, would\r\nnot have been written had not Tasso invested the subject of romantic\r\nlove and of the Crusades with such a deep interest to the authors. We\r\nof this age may miss in Tasso's poetical works the dramatic force to\r\nwhich we are accustomed in such productions; but we acknowledge the\r\nspell which the lyrical element that pervades them all, and towards\r\nwhich Tasso's genius was most strongly bent, casts over us. His own\r\npersonal history strikingly illustrates the vanity of a life spent in\r\ndependence upon princes. But fortunately the lesson is no longer\r\nneeded; for a wide and intelligent constituency of readers all over\r\nthe world now afford the patronage to literature which was formerly\r\nthe special privilege of single individuals favoured by rank or\r\nfortune. Both to authors and readers this emancipation has been\r\nproductive of the happiest results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE MARBLES OF ANCIENT ROME\r\n\r\n\r\nMarble-hunting is one of the regular pursuits of the visitor in Rome.\r\nThe ground in almost every part of the ancient city is strewn with\r\nfragments of historical monuments. The largest and most valuable\r\npieces have long since been removed by builders and sculptors, to\r\nfashion some Papal palace, or to adorn some pretentious church; and at\r\nthe present day, in almost every stone-mason's shed, blocks of marble\r\nbelonging to ancient edifices may be seen in process of conversion\r\ninto articles of modern furniture. Many bits of the rarest kinds,\r\nhowever, still remain, which not unfrequently bear traces of the\r\nrichest carving. For ages such spots have been quarries to visitors\r\nfrom all parts of the world, who wished to bring home some memorial of\r\ntheir sojourn in the Eternal City, and the supply is still far from\r\nbeing exhausted. That so much material should have survived the\r\nwholesale conversion, during the middle ages, of columns and statues\r\ninto lime, in kilns erected where the temples and palaces were most\r\ncrowded, and the vast exportation of objects of antiquity to other\r\ncountries, is a striking proof of the prodigious quantity of marble\r\nthat must have existed in ancient Rome. Now, however, such relics are\r\nmore carefully preserved; and as the places where they are found in\r\ngreatest quantity have been taken under the charge of the Government,\r\nand soldiers are constantly on the watch, it is not so easy as it\r\nused to be to abstract a fragment that has taken one's fancy.\r\n\r\nMarble fragments are so eagerly sought after because they make most\r\nsuitable and convenient souvenirs. Their own beauty and rarity, apart\r\nfrom all historical associations, are a great attraction. Many of them\r\nwill form, when cut and polished by the lapidary, pretty tazzas and\r\npaper-weights, and even the smallest bits can be put together in a\r\nmosaic pattern, so as to make extremely beautiful table-tops. Whole\r\nrows of lapidary shops in the English quarter of the city, especially\r\nin the Via Babuino and the Via Sistina, are maintained by this curious\r\ntraffic. In the Forum and Colosseum great quantities of marble and\r\nalabaster used to be found; but these localities have been so much\r\nransacked that they now afford very scanty gleanings. The Baths of\r\nCaracalla and Titus, the recent excavations on the Esquiline, the\r\nruins of the palaces of the Cæsars on the Palatine, and the open space\r\nmarked out for new squares and streets between Sta. Maria Maggiore and\r\nSt. John Lateran, are the best situations within the walls of the\r\ncity. Outside the supply is almost as large as ever. All over the vast\r\nCampagna the foot of the wayfarer strikes against some precious or\r\nbeautiful relic; and along the Appian and Latin Ways broken pieces of\r\ndifferent kinds may be found in such profusion that such spots look\r\nlike the rubbish-heap around a marble quarry. In the vast grounds over\r\nwhich the imposing ruins of Hadrian's Villa spread, heaps of fragments\r\nof marble flooring or casing may be seen in almost every neglected\r\ncorner, from which it is easy to obtain some lovely bit of giallo\r\nantico or pavonazzetto or green porphyry. Beside the ancient quay of\r\nRome, leading to the ruins of the Emporium or Custom-house--at a spot\r\ncalled in modern phrase \"La Marmorata,\" because marble vessels still\r\ndischarge their cargoes there--immense quantities of marble,\r\nalabaster, and porphyry are piled up, that were unshipped untold ages\r\nago for Roman use; and a vineyard a short way off, on the slope of\r\nthe Aventine, is much frequented by collectors on account of the\r\nrichness of its finds.\r\n\r\nBut it is not as a mere amusement, or as a means of collecting pretty\r\nsouvenirs of travel, that such marble-hunting expeditions are to be\r\nrecommended. They may have a much higher value. The different kinds of\r\nmarble collected are peculiarly interesting owing to their association\r\nwith the different epochs of the history of the city and empire; and\r\nas the specimens which the geologist obtains throw light upon the\r\nformation of the rocky strata of the earth, so the small marble\r\nfragments which the student finds in Rome afford a clue to the various\r\nstages of its existence. Indeed, a competent knowledge of the marbles\r\nof Rome is indispensable to a clear understanding of the age of its\r\nancient monuments. An immense amount of controversy has raged round\r\nsome remarkable building or statue, which would have been prevented\r\nhad the nature and origin of the marble of which it was composed been\r\nfirst investigated. The famous statue of the Apollo Belvedere in the\r\nVatican, for instance, was long regarded as an original production\r\neither of Pheidias himself or of his school. But the discovery that\r\nthe marble of which it is wrought is Lunar or Carrara marble--which\r\nwas unknown until the time of Julius Cæsar, who first introduced it\r\ninto Rome--is of itself a proof that it is not a genuine work of Greek\r\nart of the best period, but a monument of the decadence, or a copy of\r\nan original, wrought in imperial times for the adornment of a summer\r\npalace in Italy. In numberless other cases, ancient monuments have\r\nbeen identified by the mineral character and history of their marble\r\nmaterials. The first thing, therefore, which the student during his\r\nvisit to the city ought to do, is to make himself acquainted with the\r\ndifferent varieties of marble that have been found within the walls or\r\nin the neighbourhood. For this purpose the Museum in the Collegio\r\ndella Sapienza or University of Rome will afford invaluable aid. In\r\nthis institution, conveniently arranged in glass cases, are no less\r\nthan 607 specimens of various marbles and alabasters used by the\r\nancient Romans in the building or decoration of their houses and\r\npublic monuments. The collection was made by the late Signor\r\nSanginetti, Professor of Mineralogy in the University, and is quite\r\nunique. A great deal of instruction may also be obtained from the\r\nmineralogical study of the thousands of marble columns still standing\r\nin the older churches and palaces of Rome, most of which have been\r\nderived from the ruins of ancient temples and basilicas. Several\r\nexcellent books may also be consulted with advantage--especially\r\nFaustino Corsi's Treatise on the Stones of Antiquity, _Trattato delle\r\nPietre Antiche_, which is the most approved Italian work on the\r\nsubject, and from which much of the information contained in the\r\nfollowing pages has been obtained.\r\n\r\nNo marble quarries exist in the vicinity of Rome. The Sabine Hills are\r\nindeed of limestone formation, and large masses of travertine, a\r\nfresh-water limestone of igneous origin, occur here and there, but no\r\nmineral approaching marble in texture and appearance is found within a\r\nvery considerable radius of the city. The nearest source of supply is\r\nat Cesi, near the celebrated \"Falls of Terni,\" about forty-five miles\r\nfrom Rome, where \"Cotanella,\" the red marble of the Roman States, is\r\nfound, of which the great columns supporting the arches of the side\r\naisles of St. Peter's are formed. The hills and rocks of Rome are all\r\nvolcanic, and only the different varieties of eruptive rock were first\r\nemployed for building purposes. The oldest monuments of the kingly\r\nperiod, such as the Cloaca Maxima, the Mamertine Prison, the Walls of\r\nServius Tullius, and some of the earliest substructures on the\r\nPalatine Hill, were all built of the brown volcanic tufa found on or\r\nnear their sites. This is the material of which the famous Tarpeian\r\nRock and the lower part of most of the Seven Hills is composed. It is\r\nthe oldest of the igneous deposits of Rome, and seems to have been\r\nformed by a conglomerate of ashes and fragments of pumice ejected from\r\nsubmarine volcanoes whose craters have been completely obliterated. It\r\nreposes upon marine tertiary deposits, and over it, near the Church of\r\nSta. Agnese, where it is still quarried for building stone, rests a\r\nquaternary deposit, in which numerous remains of primeval elephants\r\nhave been found. Though the Consular or Republican period was a very\r\nstormy one, and the reconstruction of the city, after its partial\r\ndemolition by the Gauls, seems to have been too hurried to allow much\r\nattention to be paid to the materials and designs of architecture, yet\r\nthere are numerous indications in the existing remains of that period\r\nthat there was a decided advance in these respects upon the ruder art\r\nof a former age. Finer and more ornamental varieties of volcanic stone\r\nwere introduced from a distance, such as the _peperino_ or\r\ngrayish-green tufa of the Alban Hills, the _Lapis Albanus_ of the\r\nancients, with its glittering particles of mica interspersed\r\nthroughout its mass; the hard basaltine lava from a quarry near the\r\ntomb of Cæcilia Metella, on the Appian Way, and from the bed of the\r\nLago della Colonna, once the celebrated Lake Regillus, to which the\r\nname of _Lapis Tusculanus_ or _Selce_ was given; and the _Lapis\r\nGabinus_ or _Sperone_, a compact volcanic concrete found in the\r\nneighbourhood of the ancient Gabii on the road to Tivoli, extensively\r\nused in the construction of the earliest monuments, particularly the\r\nTabularium and the huge Arco de Pantani. Brick was also largely\r\nemployed in the construction of the foundations and inner walls of\r\npublic buildings, being arranged at a later date into ornamental\r\npatterns, to which the names of _opus incertum_ and _opus reticulatum_\r\nwere given; and in the manufacture of this substance, which they were\r\nprobably at first taught by the Etruscan artificers of Veii in the\r\nneighbourhood, the Romans reached a high degree of perfection. The\r\nearliest tombs along the Appian Way were constructed of these\r\ndifferent varieties of building materials. The sarcophagi of the\r\nScipios were hollowed out of simple blocks of peperino stone; and the\r\nsculptor's art and the material in which he wrought were worthy of the\r\nsevere simplicity of the heroic age.\r\n\r\nBut towards the close of the Republican period, Rome began to be\r\ndistinguished for the magnificence of its public monuments. As its\r\narea of conquest spread, so did its luxury increase. New divinities\r\nwere introduced from foreign countries, and domesticated in the\r\nCapitol; and these required more sumptuous fanes than those with which\r\nthe native deities had been contented. The brown tufa of the Tarpeian\r\nRock sufficed for the rude sanctuary of Vesta, the primitive\r\nhearth-stone of ancient Rome; but in the reconstruction of the\r\nsumptuous temple of Jupiter Capitolinus, which marked the grandest\r\nperiod of Roman history, the most precious stones of Asia and Africa\r\nwere employed. Statues were imported wholesale from Greece to adorn\r\ntemples and theatres, constructed after the models of Greek\r\narchitecture, with pillars, friezes, and floors of precious Pentelic\r\nand Sicilian marble. During the last century of the Republic marble\r\nbecame a common building-stone. The tomb of Cæcilia Metella, and the\r\ntemples of Ceres, Juno Sospita, and Castor and Pollux, indicate the\r\nintroduction of this precious and beautiful material. But it was\r\nreserved for the period of the Empire to complete the architectural\r\nglories of the city. Travertine, usually called _Lapis Tiburtinus_, a\r\nstraw-coloured volcanic limestone excavated in the plain below Tivoli,\r\nwhich has the useful property of hardening on exposure, was now used\r\nas the principal building-stone instead of the former lavas and tufas;\r\nand the Colosseum, entirely constructed of travertine, which was\r\ntreated in the middle ages as a quarry, out of which were built many\r\nof the palaces and churches of Rome, attests to this day the beauty\r\nand durability of this material. Quarries of crystalline marbles,\r\nadmirably adapted for the purposes of the sculptor and architect, were\r\nopened in the range of the Apennines overlooking the beautiful Bay of\r\nSpezia, in the vicinity of Carrara, Massa, and Seravezza, and largely\r\nworked in the time of Augustus. This emperor could boast that he had\r\nfound Rome of brick, and left it of marble. The marbles of each new\r\nterritory annexed to the Empire were brought at enormous expense into\r\nthe Imperial City. A quay, to which reference has already been made,\r\nwas constructed at the broadest part of the Tiber, where the vessels\r\nthat transported marbles from Africa, and from the most distant parts\r\nof Eastern Europe and Western Asia, landed their cargoes. Here\r\nnumerous blocks of marble were lately found, one of which was\r\nidentified as that sent to Nero from a quarry in Carinthia; and\r\nanother, a column of even more colossal dimensions, weighing about\r\nthirty-four tons of valuable African marble, was meant to serve as a\r\nmemorial pillar of the Council of 1870 on the Janiculum, but the\r\nintention was never carried out. So abundant was marble during the\r\nfirst two centuries of the Empire, that it was nothing accounted of.\r\nEvery temple, palace, and public edifice was built of it either in\r\nwhole or in part. The tombs that lined the Appian Way on either side\r\nfor fifteen miles had their brick cores covered with marble slabs; and\r\ntheir magnificence must have impressed every visitor who entered the\r\nImperial City through this avenue of architectural glory shrouding the\r\ndecays of death. It is obvious, then, that by studying the history of\r\nthe conquests of Rome, the student can ascertain at what period a\r\nparticular kind of marble was introduced from its native country, and\r\nthe proximate date of the building in which this marble had been used.\r\n\r\nIt was a fortunate circumstance for the preservation of the precious\r\nmarbles of Rome that Christianity laid its cuckoo egg in the nest of\r\nthe Pagan city. When the capture of Rome by Alaric gave the final blow\r\nto heathen worship, by the overthrow of the ruling classes, who alone\r\ncherished the proud memories of the ancient faith, the greater number\r\nof the temples were still standing without any one to look after the\r\nedifices or maintain the religious services. The Christians were\r\ntherefore free to take possession of the deserted shrines; and they\r\nspeedily transferred to their own churches the columns and marble\r\ndecorations that adorned the temples of the gods. Many of the precious\r\nstones that once beautified the palaces of emperors and senators were\r\nemployed to form the altars and the mosaic flooring of the memorial\r\nchapels. Almost all the early churches were constructed on or near the\r\nsites of the temples, so that the materials of the one might be\r\ntransported to the other with the least difficulty and expense, just\r\nas the settler in the back-woods of America erects his log-house in\r\nthe immediate vicinity of the trees that are most suitable for his\r\npurpose. And the striking contrast between the plain, mean exteriors\r\nof the oldest Roman churches--rough, time-stained, and unfinished\r\nsince their erection--and their gorgeous interiors, with their forests\r\nof columns separating the aisles, and the series of richly-sculptured\r\nand brilliantly-frescoed chapels, all blazing with gold and marble,--a\r\ncontrast that reminds us of the surprising difference between the\r\noutside of a common clumsy geode lying in the mud, and the sparkling\r\ncrystals in the drusic cavity at the heart of it,--would lead us to\r\ninfer that the outer walls were raised in haste to secure the valuable\r\nmaterials on the spot, before they could be otherwise appropriated.\r\nMarangoni, a learned Roman archæologist, mentions thirty-five churches\r\nin Rome as all raised upon the sites and out of the remains of ancient\r\ntemples; and no less than six hundred and eighty-eight large columns\r\nof marble, granite, porphyry, and other valuable stones, as among the\r\nrelics of heathen fanes transferred to sacred ground within the city,\r\nwhen the bronze Jupiter was metamorphosed into the Jew Peter,\r\n\r\n    \"And Pan to Moses lent his pagan horn.\"\r\n\r\nMany of these relics can be traced and identified, for it may be\r\ngenerally presumed, for the reason already given, that none are very\r\nfar removed from their original situation.\r\n\r\nI know no more interesting pursuit in Rome than such an investigation;\r\nthe objects, when their history is ascertained, acquiring a charm from\r\nassociation, over and above their own intrinsic beauty and interest.\r\nMost of the materials with which the three hundred and sixty-five\r\nchurches of modern Rome have been constructed have been derived from\r\nthe ruins of the ancient city. With the exception of a few\r\ncomparatively insignificant portions brought from the modern quarries\r\nof Carrara, Siena, and Sicily, to complete subordinate details and to\r\ngive a finish to the work, no marbles, it is said, have been used in\r\necclesiastical and palatial architecture for the last fifteen hundred\r\nyears, save those found conveniently on the spot; and hardly a brick\r\nhas been made or a stone of travertine or tufa hewn out for domestic\r\nbuildings within the same period. The construction of St. Peter's\r\nitself involved more destruction of classical monuments than all the\r\nappropriations of previous and subsequent Vandals put together. Much\r\nhas been lost on account of this extraordinary transmutation and\r\nreconsecration, whose loss we can never cease to deplore; but we must\r\nnot forget at the same time that much has been conserved which would\r\notherwise have wasted away under the slow ravages of time, been\r\nconsigned to the lime-kiln, or disappeared in obscure and ignoble use.\r\nEnough remains to overwhelm us with astonishment, and furnish\r\nmaterials for the study of years.\r\n\r\nThe white marbles of Greece were the first introduced into Rome. Paros\r\nsupplied the earliest specimens, and long held a monopoly of the\r\ntrade. _Marmor Parium_, or Marmo Greco duro, as it is called by the\r\nmodern Italians, is the very flower and consummation of the rocks.\r\nThis material seems to have been created specially for the use of the\r\nsculptor--as that in which he can express most clearly and beautifully\r\nhis ideal conceptions; and the surpassing excellence of ancient Greek\r\nsculpture was largely due to the suitability for high art of the\r\nmarble of the country, which was so stainlessly pure, delicate, and\r\nuniform--as Ruskin remarks, so soft as to allow the sculptor to work\r\nit without force, and trace on it his finest lines, and yet so hard as\r\nnever to betray the touch or moulder away beneath the chisel. Parian\r\nmarble is by far the most beautiful of the Greek marbles. It is a\r\nnearly pure carbonate of lime of creamy whiteness, with a finely\r\ncrystalline granular structure, and is nearly translucent. It may be\r\nreadily distinguished from all other white marbles by the peculiarly\r\nsparkling light that shines from its crystalline facets on being\r\nfreshly broken; and this peculiarity enables the expert at once to\r\ndetermine the origin of any fragment of Greek or Roman statuary. The\r\nancient quarries in the island of Paros are still wrought, though very\r\nlittle marble from this source is exported to other countries. In the\r\nentablature around the tomb of Cæcilia Metella, which is composed of\r\nParian marble, we see the first example in Rome of the use of\r\nornaments in marble upon the outside of a building; an example that\r\nwas afterwards extensively followed, for all the tombs of a later age\r\non the Appian Way had their exteriors sheathed with a veneer of\r\nmarble. The beautiful sarcophagus which contained the remains of the\r\nnoble lady for whom this gigantic pile was erected, and which is now\r\nin the Farnese Palace, was also formed of this material. Most\r\nbeautiful examples of Parian marble may be seen in the three elegant\r\ncolumns of the Temple of Castor and Pollux in the Roman Forum,\r\nbelonging to the best period of Græco-Roman architecture; and in the\r\nnineteen fluted Corinthian pillars which form the little circular\r\ntemple of Hercules on the banks of the Tiber, long supposed to be the\r\nTemple of Vesta. By far the largest mass of this marble in Rome is the\r\ncolossal fragment in front of the Colosseum that belonged to the\r\nTemple of Venus and Rome; and it helps to give one an idea of the\r\nextraordinary grandeur and magnificence of this building in its prime,\r\nwhose fluted columns, six feet in diameter, and the sheathing of whose\r\noutside walls of great thickness, were all made of Parian marble.\r\n\r\nMore extensively employed in Greek and Roman statuary and architecture\r\nwas the _Marmor Pentelicum_, or Marmo Greco fino of the modern\r\nItalians. The quarries which yielded inexhaustible materials for the\r\npublic buildings and statues of Greece, and for the great monuments of\r\nRome, were situated on the slopes of Mount Pentelicus, near Athens;\r\nand after having been closed for ages, have recently been reopened for\r\nthe restoration of some of the buildings in the Greek capital. The\r\nmarble is dazzlingly white and fine-grained, but it sometimes contains\r\nlittle pieces of quartz or flint, which give some trouble to the\r\nworkmen. The Parthenon, crowning like a perfect capital of human art\r\nthe summit of Nature's rough workmanship in the Acropolis, was built\r\nof this marble; and the immortal sculpture of Pheidias on the metopes,\r\nthe frieze of the cella, and the tympana of the pediments of the\r\ntemple, known as the Elgin Marbles, were carved out of a material\r\nworthy of their incomparable beauty. Innumerable specimens at one time\r\nexisted in Rome. The arch of Septimius Severus and the Arch of Titus\r\nare built of it, although the rusty and weather-beaten hue of these\r\nvenerable monuments hides the nature of the material. Domitian, who\r\nrestored the celebrated Temple of Jupiter on the Capitol, procured\r\ncolumns of Pentelic marble for the purpose from Athens; two of these\r\nare now in the nave of the church of Ara Coeli, built upon the site of\r\nthe temple; and portions of the others, and of the marble decorations,\r\nwere presented by the magistrates to the Franciscan friars of the\r\nneighbouring convent, and by them were wrought in 1348 into the\r\nconspicuous staircase leading to the façade of the church, which pious\r\nCatholics used to mount on their knees in the manner of the ancient\r\nworshippers of Jupiter. Among the statues wrought of this marble may\r\nbe mentioned the famous group of the Laocoon found in the Baths of\r\nTitus; the beautiful Venus de Medici, discovered in the Villa of\r\nHadrian, near Tivoli, and now in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence; and\r\nthe well-known \"Farnese Bull,\" sculptured out of a single block of\r\nhuge dimensions, unearthed out of the ruins of the Baths of Caracalla,\r\nand now in the Museum of Naples. Massimo d'Azeglio, in his\r\n_Recollections_, gives an interesting instance of the value set upon\r\nthis marble by modern Roman sculptors. Pacetti having purchased an\r\nancient Greek statue of the best period in Pentelic marble, greatly\r\nmutilated, and wishing to repair it, could find nothing among the best\r\nproducts of the Carrara quarries to match the marble in purity and\r\nfineness of texture, and was therefore obliged to destroy another\r\nGreek statue of inferior merit in order to get materials for the\r\nrestoration. From this combination he succeeded in producing the\r\nsleeping figure known as the Barberini Faun, whose forcible abduction\r\nby the Pontifical Government on the eve of its being sold to a German\r\nprince, so preyed upon the mind of the cruelly-wronged sculptor, that\r\nhe took to his bed and died.\r\n\r\nVery like Pentelic marble, but easily distinguishable, is the Marmor\r\nPorinum, the Marmo Grechetto duro of the Italians. It is intermediate\r\nin the quality of its grain between Parian and Pentelic marble, being\r\nfiner than the former and not so fine as the latter. The column in\r\nfront of the Church of Santa Maria Maggiore, removed by Paul V. in\r\n1614 from the Basilica of Constantine, is composed of this species; as\r\nwell as the celebrated Torso Belvedere of the Vatican, found near the\r\nsite of the Theatre of Pompey, to which Michael Angelo traced much of\r\nhis inspiration, and which, as we learn from a Greek Inscription at\r\nthe base, was the work of the Rhodian sculptor Apollonios, who carved\r\nthe group of the \"Farnese Bull.\"\r\n\r\nNot unlike this Porine marble was the _Marmor Hymettium_ of the\r\nancients; but it was never a great favourite in Rome on account of its\r\nlarge grain and dingy white colour, slightly tinged with green and\r\nmarked by long parallel dark gray veins of unequal breadth. The\r\nmetamorphic action was not sufficiently energetic to destroy the last\r\ntraces of organic matter and the original stratification of the rock;\r\nand the crystallising force was not sufficiently exercised to allow of\r\nthe entire rearrangement of the whole of the particles so as to expel\r\nthe included impurities. This marble was not therefore fitted for\r\nsculpture; but it could be used for certain architectural purposes and\r\nfor ornamentation. It used to be quarried extensively on Hymettus, the\r\nwell-known mountain of Attica, celebrated for the quantity and\r\nexcellence of its honey. The rock on which the aromatic flowers grew\r\nin such profusion for the bees, did not, however, partake of the same\r\ndelightful quality. In working it a peculiar fetid odour of\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen, somewhat like that of a stale onion, was\r\nemitted, which gave rise to its modern Italian name--Marmo Cipolla.\r\nThis repulsive quality, however, disappeared quickly on exposure. The\r\nfinest specimens of this marble in Rome are the forty-six columns in\r\nthe Church of St. Paul's, outside the gate, which belonged originally\r\nto the Basilica Æmilia in the Forum, founded about forty-five years\r\nbefore Christ, and were transferred to the new building when the\r\nvenerable old church, in which they had stood for fifteen hundred\r\nyears, was destroyed by fire. Nothing too can be finer than the two\r\nrows of Ionic columns of Hymettian marble which divide the immense\r\nnave of Santa Maria Maggiore from the side aisles. There are eighteen\r\non either side, each upwards of eight feet in circumference, and are\r\nsupposed to have been taken from the Temple of Juno Lucina, whose site\r\nis assigned by antiquaries to the immediate vicinity. Similar rows of\r\nfluted Doric columns of the same marble, ten on each side, adorn the\r\nChurch of St. Pietro in Vincoli. They are ancient, and belonged to\r\nsome temple or basilica of the Forum. There are also five ancient\r\npillars of Hymettian marble in the upper Church of San Clemente, taken\r\nfrom the same prolific source. The wall which surrounds the unique\r\nchoir or presbytery of this most interesting old church is also\r\ncomposed of great slabs of Hymettian marble, taken from the original\r\nsubterranean church and hastily put together. Some of the ancient\r\npillars of Hymettian marble belonging to the peristyle of the temple\r\nof Ceres and Proserpine, still as widely spaced as they used to be,\r\nadorn the Church of Santa Maria in Cosmedin, built on the foundation\r\nof that shrine; while twenty-four remarkably fine fluted Corinthian\r\ncolumns of the same material divide the triple nave of Santa Sabina on\r\nthe Aventine, and are supposed to have belonged to the ancient Temple\r\nof Juno Regina, erected by Camillus after the destruction of the\r\nEtruscan city of Veii. Hymettian marble was one of the first--if not\r\nactually the first--species introduced into Rome. In the year of Rome\r\n662, Lucius Crassus the orator brought to the city six columns of it,\r\neach twelve feet in height, with which he adorned his house on the\r\nPalatine Hill, receiving, on account of this circumstance, from Marcus\r\nBrutus the nickname of the Palatine Venus. At the present day the\r\nmarble is used for corner-stones in the ordinary houses of Athens.\r\n\r\nAnother livid white marble, somewhat resembling the Hymettian, is that\r\nwhich is known to the Italians as Marmo Greco livido. It was called by\r\nthe ancients _Marmor Thasium_, from Thasos, now Thapso, an island in\r\nthe north of the Ægean Sea, off the coast of Thrace. The marble dug\r\nfrom the rocky sides of Mount Ipsario--a romantic hill thickly covered\r\nwith fir trees, and rising three thousand four hundred and\r\ntwenty-eight feet above the sea--enjoyed considerable reputation among\r\nthe ancients. In Rome it must have been very common, if the name of\r\nThasian is to be given to all the fragments of nondescript dusky white\r\nmarble which are found among the ruins. Seneca says that the\r\nfish-ponds in his day were formed of that Thasian marble, with which\r\nat one time it was rare to adorn even temples. It was considered the\r\nleast valuable of the white Greek marbles, and was used for the more\r\nordinary purposes; Statius mentioning, in order to show the\r\nsurpassing splendour of a particular building, that Thasian marble was\r\nnot admitted into it. But there are not many well-defined monuments of\r\nit remaining in Rome. The chief are the bust of Euripides in the\r\nVatican, and the outside casing of the pyramid of Caius Cestius, near\r\nthe Protestant cemetery, now so weather-beaten and stained with dusky\r\nlichens that it is difficult to identify the material of which it is\r\ncomposed.\r\n\r\nFrom this marble, by a slight tinge of yellow and a little darker\r\nshade, the livid white marble of Lesbos, the _Marmor Lesbium_, or\r\nMarmo Greco Giallognolo, may be distinguished. It is not a beautiful\r\nmaterial; and yet, strange to say, the statues of some of the most\r\nbeautiful women of antiquity, such as those of Julia Pia in the\r\nVatican, and of the Capitoline Venus in the Museum of the Capitol,\r\nwere made of this marble, obtained from the birthplace of Sappho. More\r\nbeautiful is the kind known as the _Marmor Tyrium_, or the\r\nGreco-Turchinicchio, which has a light bluish tinge. It was shipped by\r\nthe ancients at the port of Tyre from some unknown quarry in Mount\r\nLebanon, which supplied the marble used without stint in the building\r\nand decoration of Solomon's Temple and Palace. In this quarry every\r\nblock was shaped and polished before it was sent to be inserted in its\r\nplace in the Temple wall, which therefore, as Heber beautifully says,\r\nsprang up like some tall palm in majestic silence. In Rome this marble\r\nwas very rare. The doors in the great piers which support the dome of\r\nSt. Peter's are each flanked by a pair of spirally-fluted columns of\r\nTyrian marble, supposed to have been brought to Rome by Titus from the\r\nTemple of Jerusalem. They originally decorated the confessional of the\r\nold Basilica. The twenty-eight steps of the Scala Santa at the\r\nLateran, said by ecclesiastical tradition to have belonged to Pilate's\r\nhouse in Jerusalem, and to have been the identical ones which our\r\nSaviour descended when He left the judgment-hall, are made of this\r\nmarble; so that, whatever we may think of the tradition itself, there\r\nis a feature of verisimilitude in the material.\r\n\r\nThe chief supply of pure white marble in Rome was derived from the\r\nquarries in the mountains at Luna, an old Etruscan town near the Bay\r\nof Spezia, which fell to decay under the later Roman emperors. This\r\nancient _Marmor Lunense_ is called by the Italians Marmo di Carrara,\r\nbecause it is identical with the famous modern Carrara marble, and\r\nbelongs to the same range of strata; the ruins of the ancient Luna\r\nbeing only a few miles from the flourishing town of Carrara, the\r\nmetropolis of the marble trade. From Parian and Pentelic marble, Lunar\r\nmarble, as already mentioned, can be easily distinguished by the less\r\nbrilliant sparkle of its crystal facets, as shown by a fresh surface,\r\nand also by its more soapy-white colour. It is simply an ordinary\r\nJurassic limestone altered by subsequent metamorphic action. The\r\nmountains which contain the quarries are highly picturesque, rising\r\nwith serried outline to a height of upwards of five thousand feet,\r\ntheir flanks scarred by deep gorges and torrent-beds, and their lower\r\nslopes clothed with olive groves, vineyards, and forest trees. Lunar\r\nmarble was first brought to Rome in the time of Julius Cæsar; and\r\nMamurra, so bitterly reviled by Catullus, the commander of the\r\nartificers in Cæsar's army in Gaul, lined with great slabs of this\r\nmarble the outside and inside of his house on the Coelian Hill--the\r\nfirst recorded instance of veneering or incrusting walls with marble.\r\nThe discovery of this method of cutting marble into thin slices, and\r\ndecorating structures of ordinary materials with them, was stigmatised\r\nby Pliny as an unreasonable mode of extending luxury. The use of Lunar\r\nmarble, on account of its easy accessibility, speedily extended to\r\nevery kind of building, public and private. So vast were the\r\nquantities sent to Rome, that Ovid expressed his fear lest the\r\nmountains themselves should disappear through the digging out of this\r\nmarble; and Pliny anticipated that dreadful consequences would be\r\nproduced by the removal in this way of the great barriers erected by\r\nNature.\r\n\r\nMany fine specimens still survive the ravages of ages, among which may\r\nbe mentioned the eleven massive Corinthian columns, upwards of\r\nforty-two feet high, and four and a half feet in diameter, which form\r\nthe peristyle of the Temple of Neptune in the Piazza di Pietra, well\r\nknown as the old Custom-house. These pillars suffered severely from\r\nthe action of fire, and are much worn and defaced, but there is a\r\ngrandeur about them still which deeply impresses the spectator; and\r\nthe blocks of marble which form the inner part of the architrave and\r\nentablature, as seen from the inner side of the court, are so\r\nstupendous that the ruins \"overhang like a beetling rock of marble on\r\na mountain peak.\" Grander still is the majestic column of Lunar marble\r\ndedicated to Marcus Aurelius, in the Piazza Colonna, which rears aloft\r\nits shaft one hundred and twenty-two feet in the air, wreathed around\r\nwith spiral bands of historic reliefs, illustrating the Roman\r\nconquests over the German tribes north of the Danube. Very splendid\r\nspecimens of the same marble may be seen in the three fluted\r\nCorinthian columns and a pilaster belonging to the Temple of Mars\r\nUltor erected by Augustus in his Forum after the battle of Actium,\r\nwhich are the largest columns of any kind of marble in Rome, being\r\neighteen feet in circumference, and upwards of fifty-four feet high.\r\nThe two well-known pillars of the portico of the Temple of Minerva,\r\ncalled Le Colonnacce, belonging to the adjoining Forum of Nerva, are\r\nalso composed of the same material; as also the three deeply-fluted\r\nCorinthian columns that remain of the Temple of Vespasian in the Roman\r\nForum, which still retain some traces of the purple colour with which\r\nthey appear to have been painted. By far the largest single masses of\r\nLunar marble are the two portions of a gigantic frieze and\r\nentablature, highly ornamented with sculpture, one measuring one\r\nthousand four hundred and ninety cubic feet, and weighing upwards of\r\none hundred tons, lying in the Colonna gardens on the slope of the\r\nQuirinal. These relics are supposed to have belonged to the splendid\r\nTemple of the Sun, which Aurelian erected after the conquest of\r\nPalmyra, and in which he deposited the rich spoils of that city. They\r\nare associated therefore with romantic memories of the famous Queen\r\nZenobia, who spent her last days near Tivoli, after having been led\r\ncaptive in fetters of gold to grace the triumphal procession of her\r\nconqueror.\r\n\r\nFor statuary purposes Lunar marble was extensively used in ancient\r\nRome. It formed the material out of which the sculptor produced some\r\nof the noblest creations of his genius. Of these the Apollo Belvedere\r\nin the Vatican collection is one of the most remarkable. The evidence\r\nof its own material, as already mentioned, has dispelled the old idea\r\nthat it is one of the masterpieces of the Greek school; and Canova's\r\nconjecture, based upon some peculiarities of its drapery, is in all\r\nlikelihood true, viz. that it was a copy of a bronze original, made,\r\nprobably at the order of Nero, for one of the baths of the imperial\r\nvilla at Antium, in whose ruins it was found in the fifteenth century.\r\nFrom the time of the Romans, the white marble of the Montes Lunenses\r\nhas been used for decorative purposes in many of the churches and\r\npublic buildings of Italy. It formed the material out of which Michael\r\nAngelo, Canova, and Thorwaldsen chiselled their immortal works. Its\r\nquality and composition, however, vary very considerably, and small\r\ncrystals of perfectly limpid quartz, called _Carrara diamonds_, and\r\niron pyrites, occasionally occur, to the annoyance of the sculptor. It\r\nbecomes soon discoloured when exposed even to the pure air of Italy,\r\nbut it is capable of resisting decay for very long periods. The\r\nopinion current in Paris, that the marbles of Carrara are unable to\r\nwithstand the effects of the climate of that city, is due to the\r\nfrequent use of inferior qualities, which are known to artists as\r\n_Saloni_ and _Ravaccioni_, and whose particles have but a feeble\r\ncohesion, and consequently slight durability.\r\n\r\nAll the white marbles which I have thus described were used in Rome\r\nprincipally for external architecture; and beautiful as a city largely\r\nbuilt of them may have looked, it must have had, nevertheless, a\r\ngarishness and artificiality which would offend the artistic eye. When\r\nnewly constructed, the Roman temples in the time of the emperors must\r\nhave been oppressive, reflecting the hot sunshine from their snowy\r\ncellæ and pillared porticoes with an insufferable glare.\r\nMarble--unlike sandstones, clay-slates, and basalts, which are kindred\r\nto the earth and the elements, and find themselves at home in any\r\nsituation, all things making friends with them, mosses, lichens,\r\nivies--is a dead, cold material, and does not harmonise with\r\nsurrounding circumstances. Like the snow, which hides the familiar\r\nbrown soil from us, with its unearthly and uncongenial whiteness, its\r\nperpetual snow chills and repels human sympathies. Nature, for a\r\nsimilar reason, introduces white flowers very sparingly into the\r\nlandscape; and their dazzling whiteness is toned down by the greenery\r\naround them, and the balancing of coloured objects near at hand, so\r\nthat they do not in reality attract more notice than other flowers.\r\nThe ancient Greeks themselves, keenly sensitive as they were to all\r\nexternal influences, had a fine instinct for this want of harmony\r\nbetween white marble and the tones of nature and the feelings of man;\r\nand therefore, in many instances, they coloured not only the marble\r\nbuildings exposed to view outside, but even the marble statues\r\ncarefully secluded in the niches within. The Parthenon was thus tinted\r\nwith vermilion, blue, and gold, which seems to us, who now see only\r\nthe golden hue with which the suns of ages have dyed its pure Pentelic\r\nmarble, a barbarous superfluity, but which, to the people of the time,\r\nwas necessary on account of the dazzling brightness of its material,\r\nconcealing the exquisite beauty of the workmanship, and the finished\r\ngrace of its proportions. Colour was used with perfect taste to\r\nrelieve the sculptured details of the exterior, to articulate and\r\nornament mouldings, and to harmonise the pure white temple with the\r\ndark blue sky of Greece and the rich warm tones of her landscape. The\r\nmagnificent sarcophagi of white marble recently discovered at Sidon,\r\nbelonging to the best type of Greek art, are most effectively adorned\r\nwith different tints and gradations of red and purple, gold being\r\nsparingly applied. We see many traces of bright colouring on the\r\ncolumns and other parts of the buildings in the Roman Forum. The\r\nbas-reliefs on the Lumachella marble of Trajan's Column were\r\noriginally picked out with profuse gilding and vivid colours; the egg\r\nand arrow moulding of the capital being tinted green, red and yellow,\r\nthe abacus blue and red, the spirals yellow, the prominent figures\r\ngilt against backgrounds of different hues, and the water of the\r\nvarious rivers blue. Statues of the deities in Rome were nearly all\r\ncoloured; and they received a fresh coat of vermilion--which, although\r\nit was the hue of divinity, was extremely fugacious--on anniversary\r\noccasions or in times of great national rejoicing.\r\n\r\nAll this pleads powerfully in behalf of Gibson's colour-creed, which\r\nhas had so much prejudice to overcome. The beauty and expression of\r\nancient sculpture, whether for outside or inside decoration, were\r\ngreatly heightened by this tinting. In cases where it was not\r\nemployed, Nature herself became the artist, and has burnt into the\r\nmarble statue or the marble pillar the warm hue of life; and the\r\nrusty, withered look of the ruins, over which ages of change have\r\npassed, touches us more than the pure white marble structure could\r\nhave done in the pride of its splendour, and appeals to the tenderest\r\nsympathies of beings who see in themselves, and in all around them,\r\nthe tokens of death and decay. The graceful Corinthian pillars of the\r\nTemple of Castor and Pollux in the Forum, the three surviving\r\nwitnesses of its former grandeur, are all the more suggestive to us by\r\nreason of the russet hues with which time has stained the snowy purity\r\nof their Parian marble; and it is difficult to say, as some one has\r\nshrewdly remarked, how much of the touching effect which the drooping\r\nfigure of the Dying Gladiator of the Capitol produces upon us may be\r\nattributed to its discoloration, and to the absence of the dainty\r\nspotlessness of the original Greek marble. That grime of ages \"lends a\r\nsort of warmth, and suggests flesh and blood,\" so that the suffering\r\nis not a cold and frosty incrustation, with which we have nothing to\r\ndo, but a real tragedy going on before our eyes, by which our\r\nsympathies are most deeply moved. In a dry, hot climate, like that of\r\nRome, there are no tender tones of vegetable colouring, no moss or\r\nlichen touches of gold or gray or green to relieve the bare cold\r\nsurface, and the rigid formal outlines of the marble; but out of the\r\nsky itself the marble gathers the soft shadows and the rich brown hues\r\nthat reconcile its strange, unnatural whiteness with the homely ways\r\nof the familiar earth. That wonderful violet sky of Rome would glorify\r\nthe meanest object. The common red brick glows in its translucent\r\natmosphere like a ruby; and the russet defaced column, as it comes out\r\nagainst its vivid light, becomes luminous like a pillar of gold. Brick\r\nand marble are of equal æsthetic value in this magic city, in which\r\nthe uncomely parts and materials have a more abundant comeliness by\r\nreason of the medium through which they are seen. Over all things\r\nlingers permanently the transfiguring glow that comes to northern\r\nlands only in the afternoon. In that land it is always afternoon; the\r\nruins bathe as it were in a perpetual sunset. The air is constantly\r\nflooded with a radiance which seems to transfuse itself through every\r\npart of the city, making all its ruinous and hoary age bright and\r\nliving, forming pictures and harmonies indescribable of the humblest\r\nobjects.\r\n\r\nThe white marbles hitherto described were principally for exterior\r\nuse. But as Roman wealth and luxury increased coloured marbles were\r\nemployed for internal decoration; and the effects which the Greeks\r\nobtained by the application of pigments, the Romans obtained by the\r\nrich hues of precious marbles incrusting their buildings, and durable\r\nas these buildings themselves. At first these rare materials were used\r\nwith a degree of moderation, chiefly in the form of mosaics of small\r\ndiscs or cubes for the pavements of halls and courts. But at length\r\nmassive pillars were constructed of them, and the vast inside brick\r\nsurfaces of imperial baths and palaces were crusted over and concealed\r\nby slabs of rare and splendid marbles, the lines of which had no\r\nnecessary connection with the mass behind or beneath. Carthage from\r\nthe spoils of its temples supplied Rome with many of its rarest\r\ncolumns; and it is probable that not a few of these survive in the\r\nChristian basilicas that occupy the sites and were built out of the\r\nmaterials of the old Pagan structures. With the decay of the Roman\r\nEmpire the use of coloured marbles in art increased, so that even\r\nbusts and statues had their faces and necks cut in white and the\r\ndrapery in coloured marble. It attained its fullest development in the\r\nByzantine style, of which, as it appeals to the senses more by colour\r\nthan by form, it is a predominant characteristic, necessary to its\r\nvitality and expression. The early Christian builders contemplated\r\nthis mode of decoration for their interiors only. Very rarely had they\r\nthe means to apply it to the outside surface, as in St. Mark's in\r\nVenice, which is the great type of the Byzantine church, coloured\r\nwithin and without with the rich hues of marbles and mosaics. Our\r\ngreat Gothic cathedrals, as an eminent architect has said, were the\r\ncreation of one thought, and hence they were complete when the workmen\r\nof the architects left them, and their whole effect is dominated by\r\none idea or one set of ideas; but the early Roman churches were the\r\nresults of a general co-operation of associated art, and the large and\r\nplain surfaces of the interiors were regarded by the sculptor as a\r\nframework for the exhibition of his decorative art. Colour was\r\nlavished in veneers of rare marbles, and costly mosaics and frescoes\r\ncovering the walls. There was thus \"less unity of purely architectural\r\ndesign, but a greater amount of general artistic wealth.\"\r\n\r\nIntermediate between the white marbles used for external architecture\r\nand the coloured marbles used for internal decoration, and forming the\r\nlink between them, is the variety called by the Italians cipollino, or\r\nonion-stone. Its classical name is _Marmor Carystium_, from Carystos,\r\na town of Euboea, mentioned by Homer, situated on the south coast of\r\nthe island at the foot of Mount Oche. This town was chiefly celebrated\r\nfor its marble, which was in great request at Rome, and also for its\r\nlarge quantities of valuable asbestos, which received the name of\r\nCarystian stone, and was manufactured by the Romans into incombustible\r\ncloth for the preservation of the ashes of the dead in the process of\r\ncremation. The asbestos occurs in the same quarries with this marble,\r\njust as this mineral is usually associated with talc schist, in which\r\nchlorite and mica are often present. Strabo places the quarries of\r\ncipollino at Marmorium, a place upon the coast near Carystos; but Mr.\r\nHawkins mentions in Walpole's _Travels_ that he found the ancient\r\nworks upon Mount Oche at a distance of three miles from the sea, the\r\nplace being indicated by some old half-worked columns, lying\r\napparently on the spot where they had been quarried. This marble is\r\nvery peculiar, and is at once recognised by its gray-green ground\r\ncolour and the streaks of darker green running through the calcareous\r\nsubstance like the coats of an onion, hence its name. These streaks\r\nbelong to a different mineral formation. They are micaceous strata;\r\nand thus the true cipollino is a mixture of talcose schist with white\r\nsaccharoidal marble, and may be said to form a transition link between\r\nmarble and common stone. It belongs to the Dolomitic group of rocks,\r\nwhich forms so large a part of the romantic scenery of South-Eastern\r\nEurope, and yields all over the world some of the best and most\r\nornamental building-stones. In this group calc-spar or dolomite\r\nwholly replaces the quartz and films of argillaceous matter, of which,\r\nespecially in Scotland, micaceous schist is usually composed. There\r\nare many varieties of cipollino, the most common being the typical\r\nmarble, a gray-green stone, sometimes more or less white, with veins\r\nof a darker green, forming waves rippling over it like those of the\r\nsea. It occurs so often among the ruins that it must have been perhaps\r\nmore frequently used in Rome than any other marble. It was also one of\r\nthe first introduced, for Mamurra lined the walls of his house on the\r\nCoelian with it, as well as with Lunar marble, in the time of Julius\r\nCæsar; but Statius mentions that it was not very highly esteemed,\r\nespecially in later times, when more valuable marbles came into use.\r\n\r\nOne remarkably fine variety called _Cipollino marino_ is distinguished\r\nby its minute curling veins of light green on a ground of clear white.\r\nFour very large columns in the Braccio Nuova of the Vatican, which may\r\nhave belonged originally, like the two large columns of _giallo\r\nantico_ in the same apartment, to some sumptuous tomb on the Appian\r\nWay, are formed of this variety, and are unique among all the other\r\npillars of cipollino marble to be seen in Rome for the brightness of\r\ntheir colour and the exquisite beauty of their venation. Nothing can\r\nbe more striking and beautiful than the rich wavelike ripples of green\r\non the cipollino marbles that encase the Baptistery of St. Mark's in\r\nVenice, as if the breakers on the Lido shore had been frost-bound\r\nbefore they fell, and the sea-nymphs had sculptured them into the\r\nwalls of this \"ecclesiastical sea-cave.\" Indeed all the outside and\r\ninside walls of the glorious old church are cased with this marble--in\r\nthe interior up to the height of the capitals of the columns; while\r\nabove that, every part of the vaults and domes is incrusted with a\r\ntruly Byzantine profusion of gold mosaics--fit image, as Ruskin\r\nbeautifully says, of the sea on which, like a halcyon's nest, Venice\r\nrests, and of the glowing golden sky that shines above it. Line after\r\nline of pleasant undulation ripples on the smooth polished marble as\r\nthe sea ebbs and flows through the narrow streets of the city. In the\r\nchurches and palaces of Rome specimens of all the varieties of\r\ncipollino may be found, taken from the old ruins, for the marble is\r\nnot now worked in the ancient quarries. The largest masses of the\r\ncommon kind in Rome are the eight grand old Corinthian columns which\r\nform the portico of the Temple of Antoninus Pius and Faustina in the\r\nForum. The height of each shaft, which is composed of a single block,\r\nis forty-six feet, and the circumference fifteen feet. The pillars\r\nlook very rusty and weather-worn, and are much battered with the\r\nill-usage which they have received.\r\n\r\nOne of the most beautiful and highly-prized marbles of ancient Rome\r\nwas the species which is familiar to every visitor under the name of\r\n_Giallo antico_. It must have existed in immense quantities in the\r\ntime of the emperors, for fragments of it are found almost everywhere,\r\nand it is the variety that is most frequently picked up and converted\r\ninto ornamental articles. It is easily recognised by its deep\r\nbrownish-yellow colour, resembling somewhat the yellow marbles of\r\nSiena and Verona, though invariably richer and brighter. All the\r\nvarieties are traversed more or less by veins and blotches of a darker\r\nyellow or brownish hue, which give them a charming variety. The\r\ntexture is remarkably fine and close-grained. In this respect _giallo\r\nantico_ can be distinguished from every other marble by the touch.\r\nWhen polished it is exquisitely smooth and soft, looking like ivory\r\nthat has become yellow with age. No fitter material could be employed\r\nfor the internal pavements or pillars of old temples, presenting a\r\nvenerable appearance, as if the suns of many centuries had stained it\r\nwith their own golden hue. From the fact that it was called by the\r\nRomans _Marmor Numidicum_, we are led to infer that this marble was\r\nquarried in Numidia, and was brought into Rome when the region was\r\nmade a Roman province by Julius Cæsar. It was probably known to the\r\nRomans in the time of Jugurtha; but the age of luxury had not then\r\nbegun, and Marius and Sulla were more intent upon the glories of war\r\nthan upon the arts of peace. The quarries on the slopes of the Atlas,\r\nworked for three hundred years to supply the enormous demand made by\r\nthe luxury of the masters of the world, were at last supposed to be\r\nexhausted; and the idea has long prevailed that the marble could only\r\nbe found among the ruins of the Imperial City. But four or five years\r\nago, the sources from which the Romans obtained some of their most\r\nprecious varieties of this material have been rediscovered in the\r\nrange of mountains called Djebel Orousse, north-east of Oran in\r\nAlgeria. All over an extensive rocky plateau in this place numerous\r\nshallow depressions plainly indicate the existence of very ancient\r\nquarries. A large company has been formed to work and export the\r\nmarble, which may now be had in illimitable quantity. The largest\r\nspecimens of _giallo antico_ existing in Rome are the eight fluted\r\nCorinthian pillars, thirty feet high and eleven feet in circumference,\r\nwith capitals and bases of white marble, which stand in pairs within\r\nthe niches of the Pantheon. In consequence of the fires of former\r\ngenerations, the marble has here and there a tinge of red on the\r\nsurface. In the Church of St. John Lateran there is a splendid pair of\r\nfluted columns of _giallo antico_, which support the entablature over\r\na portal at the northern extremity of the transept. They are thirty\r\nfeet in height and nine feet in circumference, and were found in\r\nTrajan's Forum. In the Arch of Constantine are several magnificent\r\n_giallo antico_ columns and pilasters, which are supposed to have\r\nbelonged to the triumphal arch of Trajan. They are so damaged in\r\nappearance, and so discoloured by the weather, that it is not easy,\r\nwithout close inspection, to tell the material of which they are\r\ncomposed. For pavements and the sheathing of interior walls _giallo\r\nantico_ was used more frequently than almost any other kind of\r\nmarble; hence it is mostly found in fragments of thin slabs, with the\r\nold polish still glistening upon them.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to describe, so as to identify it, the species of\r\nmarble known as _Africano_. It has a great variety of tints, ranging\r\nfrom the clearest white to the deepest black, through yellow and\r\npurple. Its texture is very compact and hard, frequently containing\r\nveins of quartz, which render it difficult to work. Its ancient name\r\nis _Marmor Chium_, for it was brought to Rome from a quarry on Mount\r\nElias, the highest summit in the island of Chios--the modern\r\nScio--which contested the honour of being the birthplace of Homer. It\r\nreceived its modern name of Africano, not from any connection with\r\nAfrica, but from its dark colour. It enters pretty frequently into the\r\ndecoration of the Roman churches, though it is rare to see it in large\r\nmasses. It seems to have been much in fashion for pavements, of which\r\nmany fragments may be seen among the ruins of Trajan's Forum. The side\r\nwall of the second chapel in the Church of Santa Maria della Pace in\r\nthe Piazza Navona is sheathed with large slabs of remarkably fine\r\nAfricano, \"with edges bevelled like a rusticated basement.\" In the\r\nBelvedere Cortile in the Vatican is a portion of an ancient column of\r\nthis marble, which is the most beautiful specimen in Rome; and the\r\nprincipal portal of the portico of St. Peter's is flanked by a pair of\r\nfluted Roman Ionic columns of Africano, which are the largest in the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nClosely allied to this marble is an ancient species which puzzles most\r\nvisitors by its Protean appearance. Its tints are always neutral, but\r\nthey vary in depth from the lightest to the darkest shade, and are\r\nnever mixed but in juxtaposition. Dirty yellows, cloudy reds, dim\r\nblues and purples, occur in the ground or in the round or waved\r\nblotches or crooked veins. It has a fine grain and a dull fracture.\r\nThis variety of Africano is known by the familiar name of _Porta\r\nSanta_, from the circumstance that the jambs and lintel of the first\r\nPorta Santa--a Holy Door annexed by Boniface VIII. to St. Peter's in\r\nthe year 1300--were constructed of this marble. The Porta Santa, it\r\nmay be mentioned, was instituted in connection with a centenary\r\njubilee, but afterwards the period of formally opening it was reduced\r\nto fifty years, and now it is shortened to twenty-five. On the\r\noccasion of the jubilee, on Christmas Eve, the Pope knocks three times\r\nwith a silver hammer against the masonry with which it is filled up,\r\nwhich is then demolished, and the Holy Door remains open for a whole\r\ntwelvemonth, and on the Christmas Eve of the succeeding year is closed\r\nup in the same manner as before. A similar solemnity is performed by\r\nproxy at the Lateran, the Liberian, and the Pauline Basilicas. In all\r\nthese great churches, as in St. Peter's, the jambs and Lintel of the\r\nHoly Door are of Porta Santa marble. This beautiful material was\r\nbrought from the mountains in the neighbourhood of Jassus--a\r\ncelebrated fishing town of Caria, situated on a small island close to\r\nthe north coast of the Jassian Bay. From this circumstance it was\r\ncalled by the ancient Romans _Marmor Jassense_. Near the quarries was\r\na sanctuary of Hestia, with a statue of the goddess, which, though\r\nunprotected in the open air, was believed never to be touched by rain.\r\nThe marble, the most highly-prized variety of which was of a blood-red\r\nand livid white colour, was used in Greece chiefly for internal\r\ndecoration. It was introduced in large quantity into Rome, and there\r\nare few churches in which the relics of it that existed in older\r\nbuildings have not been adapted for ornamental purposes. Among the\r\nlarger and finer masses of Porta Santa may be enumerated two columns\r\nand pilasters which belong to the monument of Clement IX., in the\r\nChurch of Santa Maria Maggiore, and which are remarkable for their\r\nexceedingly fine texture and the unusual predominance of white among\r\nthe other hues; four splendid Corinthian pillars, considered the\r\nfinest in Rome, in the nave of Sta. Agnese; the pair of half columns\r\nwhich support the pediment of the altar in the Capella della\r\nPresentazione in St. Peter's; and the basin of the handsome fountain\r\nin front of the Pillar of Marcus Aurelius in the Piazza Colonna,\r\nconstructed by the architect Giacoma della Porta out of an enormous\r\nmass of Porta Santa found lying on the ancient wharf.\r\n\r\nFrequent specimens of a beautiful marble known as _Fior di Persico_,\r\nfrom the resemblance of the colour of its bright purple veins on a\r\nwhite ground to that of the blossom of the peach, may be found in the\r\nRoman churches. It was much used for mouldings, sheathings, and\r\npedestals, and also for floors. In the Villa of Hadrian large\r\nfragments of slabs of this marble may be found, which lined the walls\r\nand floors of what are called the Greek and Latin Libraries. The\r\nPortuguese Church in Rome has several columns of Fior di Persico\r\nsupporting the pediments of altars in the different chapels;\r\nespecially four pairs of fluted ones which adorn the two altars at the\r\nextremity of the nave, which are among the largest and finest in Rome.\r\nBut the most splendid specimens of all are a pair of columns in the\r\nPalazzo Rospigliosi. The dado, eight feet in height, in the gorgeous\r\nCorsini chapel in the Church of St. John Lateran, is formed of large\r\ntablets of highly-polished Fior di Persico, and the frieze that\r\nsurrounds the whole chapel is composed of the same beautiful material,\r\nwhose predominance over every other marble is the peculiarity of this\r\nsanctuary. The ancient name of this marble was _Marmor Molossium_,\r\nfrom a region in Epirus--now Albania--which was a Roman province in\r\nthe time of Pompey. It is associated with the celebrated campaigns in\r\nItaly of Pyrrhus, king of Epirus, in which Greece was for the first\r\ntime brought into contact with Rome. The region in which the quarries\r\nexisted was the most ancient seat of Pelasgic religion.\r\n\r\nThe infinite hues and markings of the coloured marbles have all been\r\npainted by Nature with one material only, variously proportioned and\r\napplied--the oxide of iron. The varieties of marble are mainly caused\r\nby the different degrees in which this substance has pervaded them.\r\nThey are variable mixtures of the metamorphous carbonates of protoxide\r\nof iron and lime. And it is an interesting fact that there is a\r\ndistinct relation between deposits of magnetic iron ore and the\r\nmetamorphoses of limestones into marbles; so that this substance not\r\nonly gives to the marbles their colouring, but also their texture.\r\nEven the whitest saccharoidal or statuary marble, which it has not\r\ncoloured, it has created by the crystallisation of the limestone\r\nassociated with it. And the marbles of the entire province of the\r\nApuan Alps owe their existence to the large quantities of iron ore\r\ndisseminated throughout them, which have exercised a great influence\r\non the molecular modification they have undergone. The same changes\r\nhave been produced on the limestones of Greece and Asia Minor by veins\r\ncontaining iron ore running through them.\r\n\r\nAnd of the marbles thus produced, one of the most beautiful is that\r\nwhich is known in Rome by the name of Pavonazzetto, from its\r\npeacock-like markings. The ground is a clear white, with numerous\r\nveins of a dark red or violet colour, while the grain is fine, with\r\nlarge shining scales. It resembles alabaster in the form and character\r\nof its veins, and in its transparent quality. It is a Phrygian marble,\r\nand was known to the ancients under the name of _Marmor Docimenum_.\r\nThe poet Statius notices the legend that it was stained with the blood\r\nof Atys. It was a favourite marble of the emperor Hadrian, who\r\nemployed it to decorate his tomb. It was brought to Rome when Phrygia\r\nbecame a Roman province, after the establishment of Christianity in\r\nAsia Minor. At first the quarry yielded only small pieces of the\r\nmarble, but when it came into the possession of the Romans they\r\ndeveloped its resources to the utmost; numerous large monolithic\r\ncolumns being wrought on the spot, and conveyed at great expense and\r\nlabour to the coast. Colonel Leake supposes that the extensive\r\nquarries on the road from Khoorukun and Bulwudun are those of the\r\nancient Docimenum. Hamilton, in his _Researches_, says that he saw\r\nnumerous blocks of marble and columns in a rough state, and others\r\nbeautifully worked, lying in this locality. In an open space beside a\r\nmosque lay neglected a beautifully-finished marble bath, once\r\nintended, perhaps, for a Roman villa; and in the wall of the mosque,\r\nand of the cemetery beside it, were numerous friezes and cornices,\r\nwhose elaborately-finished sculptures of the Ionic and Corinthian\r\norders proved that they were never designed for any building on the\r\nspot, but were in all probability worked near the quarries for the\r\npurpose of easier transportation, as is done in the quarries of\r\nCarrara at the present day. Pavonazzetto is thus associated in an\r\ninteresting manner with the Phrygian cities of Laodicea and Colosse.\r\nWhen St. Paul was preaching the Gospel through this part of Asia\r\nMinor, the architects of Rome were conveying this splendid marble from\r\nthe quarries of the Cadmus, to adorn the palatial buildings of the\r\nImperial City. No marble was so highly esteemed as this, and no other\r\nspecies is so frequently referred to by the Latin poets.\r\n\r\nThe high altar of the subterranean church, under which the relics of\r\nSt. Ignatius and St. Clement are supposed to lie, is covered by a\r\ncanopy supported by elegant columns of pavonazzetto marble; while the\r\nhigh altar of the upper church is similarly surmounted by a double\r\nentablature of Hymettian marble, supported by four columns of\r\npavonazzetto. The extra-mural church of St. Paul's had several\r\nsplendid pillars of Phrygian marble, taken by the emperor Theodosius\r\nfrom the grandest of the law courts of the Republic; but these were\r\nunfortunately destroyed during the burning of the old basilica about\r\nsixty years ago. We see in the flat pilasters of this purple-veined\r\nmarble, now erect against the transepts of the restored church, the\r\nvestiges of the magnificent Æmilian Basilica in the Forum, of whose\r\ncelebrated columns Pliny spoke in the highest terms. Specimens of\r\npavonazzetto are to be seen in almost every church in Rome. In the\r\ninteresting old Church of Sta. Agnese there are two columns of this\r\nmarble, the flutings of which are remarkable for their cabled\r\ndivisions. The gallery above is supported on small columns, most of\r\nwhich are of pavonazzetto spirally fluted. In the Church of Santa\r\nMaria degli Angeli there is also a remarkably fine specimen; while\r\nthere is a grand pair of columns in the vestibule of St. Peter's\r\nbetween the transept and the sacristy. Fourteen fluted columns of\r\nPhrygian marble have been dug up from the site of the Augustan Palace\r\non the Palatine; while the one hundred and twenty employed by the\r\nemperor Hadrian, in the Temple of Juno and Jupiter erected by him,\r\nhave been distributed among several of the Roman churches. The side\r\nwalls of the splendid staircase of the Bracchi Palace are sheathed\r\nwith a very rare and beautiful variety, remarkable for the delicacy of\r\nits veins and its brilliant polish. The veneer was produced by slicing\r\ndown two ancient columns discovered near the Temple of Romulus\r\nMaxentius in the Forum, converted into the Church of SS. Cosma e\r\nDamiano. But the finest of all the pavonazzetto columns of Rome are\r\nthe ten large ones in the Church of San Lorenzo outside the walls. In\r\nthe volute of the capital of one of them a frog has been carved, which\r\nidentifies it as having formerly belonged to the Temple of Jupiter or\r\nJuno, within the area of the Portico of Octavia. Pliny tells us that\r\nboth temples were built at their own expense by two wealthy\r\nLacedæmonian artists, named Sauros and Batrakos; and, having been\r\nrefused the only recompense they asked--the right to place an\r\ninscription upon the buildings,--they introduced into the capitals of\r\nthe pillars, surreptitiously, the symbols of their respective names, a\r\nlizard and a frog.\r\n\r\nThe most precious of the old marbles of Rome is the _Rosso antico_.\r\nIts classical name has been lost, unless it be identical, as Corsi\r\nconjectures, with the Marmor Alabandicum, described by Pliny as black\r\ninclining much to purple. For a long time it was uncertain where it\r\nwas found, but recently quarries of it have been discovered near the\r\nsea at Skantari, a village in the district of Teftion, which show\r\ntraces of having been worked by the ancients. From these quarries the\r\nmarble can only be extracted in slabs and in small fragments. This is\r\nthe case, too, with all the red marbles of Italy, which, in spite of\r\ntheir compact character, scale off very readily, and are friable,\r\nvitreous, and full of cleavage planes, in addition to which they are\r\nusually only found in thin beds, which prevents their being used for\r\nother purposes than table-tops and flooring-slabs. The predominance of\r\nmagnetic iron ore, to which they owe their vivid colour, has thus\r\nseriously affected the molecular arrangement of the rocks. It is\r\nprobable that _rosso antico_, like the Italian red marbles, belongs to\r\none or other of the Liassic formations, which, in Italy as well as in\r\nGreece and Asia Minor, constitutes a well-marked geological horizon by\r\nits regular stratification and its characteristic ammonite fossils.\r\nThe quantity found among the Roman ruins of this marble is very large;\r\nmany of the shops in Rome carving their models of classical buildings\r\nin this material. But the fragments are comparatively small. When used\r\nin architecture they have been employed to ornament subordinate\r\nfeatures in some of the grander churches. The largest specimens to be\r\nseen in Rome are the double-branched flight of seven very broad steps,\r\nleading from the nave to the high altar of Santa Prassede. Napoleon\r\nBonaparte, a few months before his fall, had ordered these slabs of\r\n_rosso antico_ to be sent to Paris to ornament his throne; but\r\nfortunately the order came too late to be executed. The cornice of the\r\npresent choir is also formed of this very rare marble; while large\r\nfragments of the old cornice of the same material, which ran round the\r\nwhole church, are preserved in the Belvedere Cortile of the Vatican.\r\nTradition asserts that the pieces which have been converted to these\r\nsacred uses in the church once belonged to the house of Pudens, the\r\nfather of its titular saint, in which St. Peter is supposed to have\r\ndwelt when in Rome. The entrance to the chamber of the Rospigliosi\r\nPalace, which contains the far-famed \"Aurora\" of Guido Reni on the\r\nceiling, is flanked by a pair of Roman Ionic columns of _rosso\r\nantico_, fourteen feet high, which are the largest in Rome, although\r\nthe quality of the marble is much injured by its lighter colour, and\r\nby a white streak which runs up each shaft nearly from top to bottom.\r\nIn the sixth room of the Casino of the Villa Borghese the jambs of the\r\nmantelpiece are composed of _rosso antico_ in the form of caryatides\r\nsupporting a broad frieze of the same material wrought in bas-relief.\r\n\r\nThis marble seems to have been the favourite material in which to\r\nexecute statues of the Faun; for every one who has visited the Vatican\r\nSculpture Gallery and the Museum of the Capitol will remember well the\r\nbeautiful statues of this mythic being in _rosso antico_, which are\r\namong their chief treasures, and once adorned the luxurious Villa of\r\nHadrian at Tivoli. This marble is admirably adapted for such\r\nsculpture, for it gives to the ideal of the artist the warm vividness\r\nof life. And it seems a fit colour, as Nathaniel Hawthorne has said,\r\nin which to express the rich, sensuous, earthy side of nature, the\r\nhappy characteristics of all wild natural things which meet and mingle\r\nin the human form and in the human soul; the Adam, the red man formed\r\nout of the red clay, in which the life of the animals and the life of\r\nthe gods coalesce. In the Gabinetto of the Vatican, along with a large\r\nsquare tazza of _rosso antico_, is kept a most curious arm-chair of\r\nthis marble, called _sedia forata_, found near the Church of St. John\r\nLateran, upon which, in the middle ages, the Popes were obliged to sit\r\nat their installation in the presence of the Cardinals. This custom,\r\nwhich was practised as late as the coronation of Julius II. in 1503,\r\narose from a desire to secure the throne of St. Peter from being\r\nintruded upon by a second Pope Joan--whether there ever really was\r\nsuch a personage, or whatever gave rise to the curious myth. The chair\r\nis like an ordinary library chair, with solid back and sides,\r\nsculptured out of a single block, and perforated in the seat with a\r\ncircular aperture. _Rosso antico_ is not what might strictly be called\r\na beautiful marble. Its colour is dusky and opaque, resembling that of\r\na bullock's liver, marked with numerous black reticulations, so minute\r\nand faint as to be hardly visible. But the grain is extremely fine,\r\nadmitting of the highest polish.\r\n\r\nOf black marbles--in the formation of which both the animal and\r\nvegetable kingdoms have taken part, their substance being composed of\r\nthe finely-ground remains of foraminifera, corals, and shells, and\r\ntheir colour produced by the carbonaceous deposits of ancient\r\nforests--few kinds seem to have been used by the ancient Romans. The\r\n_nero antico_ was the species most esteemed, on account of its compact\r\ntexture, fine grain, and deep black colour, marked occasionally with\r\nminute white short straight lines, always broken and interrupted. It\r\nis the _Marmor Tænarium_ of the ancients, quarried in the Tænarian\r\npeninsula, which forms the most southerly point in Europe, now called\r\nCape Matapan. The celebrated quarries which Pliny eloquently\r\ndescribes, but for which Colonel Leake inquired in vain, were under\r\nthe protection of Poseidon, whose temple was at the extremity of the\r\npeninsula. They attracted, on account of the sanctuary which the\r\ntemple afforded, large numbers of criminals who fled from the pursuit\r\nof justice, and who readily found work in them. Very fine specimens of\r\nthis marble may be seen in a pair of columns in the obscure Church of\r\nSanta Maria Regini Coeli, near the Convent of St. Onofrio, on the\r\nother side of the Tiber; in a pair in the church of Ara Coeli; and\r\nalso in a pair in the third room of the Villa Pamphili Doria, which\r\nare extremely fine, and are probably as large as any to be met with.\r\nIn consequence of the quantity used in the inscriptional tablets of\r\nmonuments, for which this seems to be the favourite material, _nero\r\nantico_ is extremely scarce in modern Rome. The _bigio antico_ is a\r\ngrayish marble, composed of white and black, sometimes in distinct\r\nstripes or waves, and sometimes mingled confusedly together. It was\r\nthe _Marmor Batthium_ of the ancients, and two of the large columns in\r\nthe principal portal of the Church of Santa Croce in Jerusalemme are\r\nremarkably fine specimens of it, probably taken from the Villa of\r\nHeliogabalus, in whose gardens, called the Horti Variani, the church\r\nwas built.\r\n\r\nAnother species is the _bianco e nero antico_, the _Marmor\r\nProconnesium_ of antiquity, obtained from the celebrated quarries of\r\nProconnesos, an island in the western part of the Propontis. Many of\r\nthe towns of Greece were decorated with this marble. The internal part\r\nof the famous sepulchre erected by Artemisia, the widow of Mausolus,\r\nking of Caria, to her husband, and after whom all grand tombs ever\r\nsince have received the name of mausoleum, was built of this marble.\r\nSo celebrated were the quarries of Proconnesos that the ancient name\r\nof the island was changed to Marmora, and the whole of the Propontis\r\nis now called the Sea of Marmora. Although so highly esteemed in\r\nGreece, this marble does not seem to have been extensively used in\r\nRome; the finest relics being the four columns supporting the marble\r\ncanopy, in the form of a Gothic temple, which surmounts the high altar\r\nof St. Cæcilia, which is among the most ancient of all the churches of\r\nRome. They were probably derived from some old Roman palace, and are\r\nremarkable for the clearness and brilliancy of the white blotches on a\r\nblack ground. There are different varieties of this marble: one kind\r\nin which the blotches or veins are pure black on a pure white ground,\r\nand another in which the blotches or veins are pure white on a black\r\nground. In these varieties, however, the black and the white are more\r\nconfused together, but remain notwithstanding distinct and separate,\r\nso that if the veins are white the ground is sure to be black, and\r\n_vice versâ_. The ancient _Marmor Rhodium_, or the _giallo e nero_,\r\nhad golden-coloured veins on a black ground, and, owing to its compact\r\ntexture, was capable of receiving a high polish. It is very like the\r\ncelebrated marble of Portovenere, a modern Italian species obtained\r\nfrom the western hills of the Gulf of Spezia, where the formation\r\npasses into that of the ammonitiferous limestones of the Lias and of\r\nthe palæozoic rocks. A beautiful highly-polished specimen of Rhodian\r\nmarble exists in the mask in front of the tomb of Paul III. in the\r\ntribune of St. Peter's, sculptured by Della Porta in 1547, long\r\nprevious to the discovery of the quarries of Portovenere. It may be\r\nremarked that the grain of the latter species is such that it will not\r\nkeep its polish without extreme care; a circumstance which\r\ndistinguishes it from the Rhodian marble, whose tenacity in this\r\nrespect renders it eminently adapted for the more costly class of\r\ndecorative works.\r\n\r\nThe marbles we have been hitherto considering belong to the older\r\ncalcareous formations of Italy, Greece, Asia Minor, and Egypt, and go\r\ndown to the upper triassic and muschel-kalk limestones, and perhaps\r\neven to those of an older period. But there is a class of ancient\r\nmarbles in Rome of much more recent geological origin--belonging\r\nindeed to the Miocene epoch--which are called Lumachella, from the\r\nItalian word signifying snail, on account of the presence in all the\r\nspecies of fossil shells. They vary in colour from the palest straw to\r\nthe deepest purple. Some of them are exceedingly beautiful and\r\nvaluable, and they are nearly all more or less rare, being found\r\nchiefly in small fragments of ancient pavements. Their substance is\r\nformed of the shells of the common oyster in bluish gray and black\r\nparticles on a white ground, as in the Lumachella d' Egitto; of the\r\ncardium or cockle, assuming a lighter or deeper shade of yellow, as in\r\nthe Lumachella d' Astracane; of the ammonite, as in the L. Corno d'\r\nAmmone; of the Anomia ampulla in the L. occhio di Pavone, so called\r\nfrom the circular form of the fossils whichever way the section is\r\nmade; of encrinites, belemnites, and starfish, showing white or red on\r\na violet ground, as in the L. pavonazza; and \"of broken shells, hardly\r\ndiscernible, together with very shining and saccharoid particles of\r\ncarbonate of lime,\" as in the _Marmor Schiston_ of the ancients--the\r\n_brocatello antico_ of the Italians, so named from its various shades\r\nof yellow and purple, resembling silk brocade. The most important\r\nspecimens of Lumachella marbles are the pair of very fine large\r\ncolumns of L. rosea on the ground-floor of the Schiarra Palace, the\r\nbalustrade of the high altar of St. Andrea della Valle, two columns in\r\nthe garden of the Corsini Palace of L. d' Astracane, and a pair of\r\nlarge pillars which support one of the arches of the Vatican Library,\r\nformed of L. occhio di pavone. Specimens of brocatello may be found in\r\nseveral churches and palaces, forming mouldings, sheathings, and\r\npedestals.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting of the Lumachella marbles is the _bianca antica_,\r\nthe Marmor Megarense of the ancients, composed of shells so small as\r\nto be scarcely discernible, and so closely compacted that the\r\nsubstance takes a good polish. The well-known Column of Trajan--the\r\nfirst monument (_columna cochlæa_) of this description ever raised in\r\nRome, and far superior to the Antonine Column--is composed of\r\nLumachella marble from Megara. It presents, in twenty-three spiral\r\nbands of bas-reliefs, winding round thirty-four blocks of stone, the\r\nhistory of the victories of Trajan over the Dacians, and, without\r\nreckoning horses, implements of war, and walls of cities, is said to\r\nconsist of no less than two thousand five hundred figures, each about\r\ntwo feet two inches high. It is a strikingly suggestive thought, that\r\nthis majestic pillar--which produced so deep an impression upon the\r\nminds of posterity that, according to the beautiful legend, Pope\r\nGregory the Great was moved to supplicate, by means of masses in\r\nseveral of the Roman churches, for the liberation of him whom it\r\ncommemorated from purgatory--should be composed of the relics of\r\nsea-shells.\r\n\r\n    \"Memorial pillar! 'mid the wreck of Time,\r\n    Preserve thy charge with confidence sublime,\"\r\n\r\nsaid Wordsworth; but this sublime charge is committed to frail\r\nkeeping. It is itself a sepulchre of the dead; and the tragedies of\r\nthe Dacian war are inscribed upon tragedies that took place long ages\r\nbefore there was any human eye to witness them. The historic\r\nsculptures that so deeply move our pity for a conquered people, are\r\nbased upon the immemorial sculptures of creatures whose sacrifice in\r\nwhole hecatombs touches us not, because it is part of the order of the\r\nworld by which life forms the foundation of and minister to life. It\r\nis strange how many of the grandest monuments are wrought out of the\r\ncreations of primeval molluscs. The enduring pyramids themselves are\r\nformed of the nummulitic limestone studded with its \"Pharaoh's beans,\"\r\nthe exuviæ of shell-fish that perished ages before the Nile had\r\ncreated Egypt.\r\n\r\nOf the breccias there is a great variety among the relics of ancient\r\nRome. A breccia is a rock made up of angular pebbles or fragments of\r\nother rocks. When the pebbles are rounded the conglomerate is a\r\npudding-stone. Marble breccias are formed of angular pieces of highly\r\ncrystalline limestone, united together by a siliceo-calcareous cement,\r\ncontaining usually an admixture of a hornblendic substance, and which\r\nis due to a particular action of adjacent masses or veins of iron ore.\r\nThe hornblendic cement, with its iron or manganese base, produces the\r\nvariegated appearance which may be seen in specimens from different\r\nlocalities. As may be imagined from their composition, these rocks are\r\nas a rule extremely unalterable by ordinary atmospheric agencies, and\r\nare susceptible of a high degree of polish, which they retain with the\r\nutmost tenacity. They were favourite materials with the ancient Roman\r\ndecorators; but they do not occur in large masses in the city. A\r\nbeautiful pair of Roman Ionic columns under the pediment of the altar\r\nof the third chapel in the Church of Ara Coeli are made of a valuable\r\nbreccia called Breccia dorata, distinguished by its small light-golden\r\nfragments on a ground of various shades of purple. The high altar of\r\nSanta Prisca on the Aventine is supported by one column of Breccia\r\ncorallina of remarkably fine quality, in which the fragments are white\r\non a ground of light coral-red. In the second chapel of St. Andrea\r\ndella Valle there are two Corinthian columns of Breccia gialla e nera,\r\nwhich is an aggregate mass of yellow and black fragments: the yellow\r\nin its brilliant golden hue surpassing that of all other marbles, and\r\nforming a striking contrast to the long irregular black fragments\r\ninterspersed throughout it. In the first chapel of the same church\r\nthere are four fluted Corinthian columns of breccia gialla, containing\r\nsmall and regular blotches, of which the prevailing tint is orange,\r\neach fragment edged with a rim of deeper yellow that surrounds it like\r\na shadow. A most beautiful variety of Breccia gialla e nera forms the\r\nbasin of holy water at the entrance of the Church of St. Carlo di\r\nCatinari, in which \"the colours resemble a golden network spread upon\r\na ground of black\"; and an exceedingly lovely urn is seen underneath\r\nthe altar in one of the chapels of the Portuguese Church, in which\r\nwhite fragments are imbedded in a purple ground which shines through\r\ntheir soft transparency.\r\n\r\nNot the least attractive objects in the chamber of the Dying Gladiator\r\nin the Museum of the Capitol area portion of a large column of very\r\nbeautiful and extremely valuable Breccia tracagnina, in which\r\ngolden-yellow, white, red, and blue fragments occur in very nearly\r\nequal proportions, and two large pedestals of Breccia di\r\nSete-Bassi--so called from the discovery of the first specimens near\r\nthe ruins of the Villa of Septimus Bassus on the Appian\r\nWay--containing very small purple fragments of an oblong shape, which\r\nis the characteristic peculiarity of all the varieties of this species\r\nof marble. Probably the most beautiful of all the ancient breccias is\r\nthat called Breccia della Villa Adriana, from its occasional\r\noccurrence in the ruins of Hadrian's Villa, and also Breccia\r\nQuintilina, from its having been found in the grounds of the\r\nmagnificent Villa of Quintilius Varus, commemorated by Horace, at\r\nTivoli, now occupied by the Church of the Madonna di Quintigliolo. The\r\nprevailing colour of the fragments is that of a dark brown intermixed\r\nwith others of smaller size, of red, green, blue, white, purple,\r\nbright yellow, and sometimes black, all harmonising together most\r\nbeautifully. The comparatively small pieces found at Tivoli now adorn\r\nthe Churches of St. Andrea della Valle, famous for its rich varieties\r\nof breccias, St. Domenico e Sisto and Santa Pudenziana, where they\r\nappear among the marble sheathing of the walls. In the chapel of the\r\nGaetani in the last-mentioned church, the wall is incrusted with the\r\nrichest marbles, especially Lumachella and Brocatello, and large\r\ntablets of Hadrian's breccia setting off the splendid sarcophagus of\r\nBreccia nera e gialla dedicated to Cardinal Gaetani.\r\n\r\nAlong with the breccias which I have thus incidentally noticed, but to\r\nwhich a whole essay might be devoted on account of their beauty, rich\r\nvariety, and great value and rarity, should be classified a kind of\r\n\"breccia dure,\" called Breccia d' Egitto. It is not, however, a true\r\nbreccia, but a pudding-stone, composed, not of calcareous but of\r\nsiliceous fragments; and these fragments are not angular, as in the\r\ntrue breccias, but rounded, indicating that they had been carried by\r\nwater and consequently rounded by attrition. The connected pebbles\r\nmust have been broken from rocks of great hardness to have withstood\r\nthe effects of constant abrasion. In the Egyptian breccia are found\r\nvery fine pebbles of red granite, porphyry of a darker or lighter\r\ngreen, and yellow quartz, held together by a cement of compact\r\nfelspar. It has a special geological interest, inasmuch as it\r\nrepresents an ancient sea-beach flanking the crystalline rocks of\r\nUpper Egypt, where the cretaceous and nummulitic limestones end. The\r\npebbles were derived from the central nucleus of granite from beyond\r\nAssouan to the upper end of the Red Sea, round which are folded\r\nsuccessive zones of gneiss and schist pierced by intrusive masses of\r\nporphyry and serpentine. The pair of beautiful Grecian Ionic columns,\r\nand the large green tazza--eighteen feet in circumference--the finest\r\nspecimen of Egyptian breccia to be seen in Rome, both in the Villa\r\nAlbani, and the vase of the same material in the chamber of Candelabra\r\nin the Vatican, in which the prevailing green colour is crossed by\r\nseveral stripes of pure white quartz, may thus have been sculptured\r\nout of a portion of littoral deposit formed from the ruins of the\r\ncrystalline rocks of the mountain group of Sinai. There is something\r\nextremely interesting and suggestive to the imagination in the twofold\r\norigin of these conglomerate ornaments of the palaces of Rome. Around\r\nthem gather the wonderful associations of ancient human history, and\r\nthe still more awe-inspiring associations of geological history. They\r\nspeak to us of the conquests of Rome in the desolate tracts of Nubia\r\nand Arabia, from which the spoils that enriched its palaces and\r\ntemples were derived; and of the existence of coast-lines, when Egypt\r\nwas a gulf stretching from the Mediterranean to the Mountains of the\r\nMoon, which became silted up by slow accumulations. Their language, in\r\nboth relations, is that of ruin. They are survivors both of the ruins\r\nof Nature and of Man, and are made up of the wrecks of both. Older far\r\nthan the marbles which keep them company in the sculptor's halls and\r\nchurches of Rome, and whose human history is equally eventful, their\r\nmaterials were deposited along the shore of a vanished sea, when the\r\nmountains that yielded these marbles lay as calcareous mud in its\r\ndepths.\r\n\r\nAlabasters, of which there are numerous varieties, from pure\r\ndiaphanous white to the deepest black, were favourite decorative\r\nmaterials with the ancient Romans. The different kinds were used for\r\nthe walls of baths, vases, busts, pillars, and sepulchral lamps, in\r\nwhich the light shining through the transparent sides had an\r\nagreeable softness. Cornelius Nepos, as quoted by Pliny, speaks of\r\nhaving seen columns of alabaster thirty-two feet in length; and Pliny\r\nsays that he himself had seen thirty huge pillars in the dining-hall\r\nof Callistus, the freedman of Claudius. One such column still exists\r\nin the Villa Albani, which is twenty-two and a half feet in height.\r\nThe ancients obtained large blocks of alabaster from quarries in\r\nThebes in Egypt, in the neighbourhood of Damascus, and on Mount\r\nTaurus. They imported some kinds also from Cyprus, Spain, and Northern\r\nAfrica. They obtained varieties nearer home, in different parts of\r\nItaly, such as the beautiful Alabastro di Tivoli, employed by Hadrian\r\nin his villa, and which appears to have been brought from Terni, where\r\nit still exists in abundance. From the quarry near Volterra the\r\nEtruscans obtained the alabaster for their cinerary urns. The European\r\nalabasters are accumulated masses of stalactite and stalagmite, formed\r\nby the slow dropping of water charged with sulphate of lime, to which\r\ncircumstance they owe the parallel stripes or concentric circles with\r\nwhich they are marked, while the rich and delicate varieties of\r\ncolouring are produced by the oxides of iron which the water carries\r\nwith it in its infiltration through the intervening strata. They are\r\nvery soft and perishable, and consequently are very rarely found among\r\nthe ruins of ancient Rome. The Oriental alabasters, on the other hand,\r\nwhich are distinguished from the European by their superior hardness\r\nand durability, are in reality not sulphates, but carbonates of lime.\r\nTheir hardness is quite equal to that of the best statuary marbles.\r\nThe ancient quarries on the hill--the modern Mount St. Anthony--near\r\nthe town of Alabastron, in Middle Egypt, from which the material got\r\nits name, have only recently been re-opened, but blocks of large size\r\nand perfect beauty have been obtained. Owing to the facility with\r\nwhich alabaster can be reduced by fire to lime, very few large\r\nexamples of it in Rome have escaped the ruthless kilns of the middle\r\nages. The most interesting specimens of ancient alabaster are the very\r\nbeautiful vase of Alabastro cotognino, prolate in form, and in colour\r\nwhite, streaked with very light pink, which contained the ashes of\r\nAugustus, found in the ruins of his mausoleum, and now in the Vatican;\r\nthe bust of Julius Cæsar, made of the variety _tartaruga_, from the\r\nresemblance of its brownish-yellow markings to tortoise-shell, in the\r\nMuseum of the Capitol; and the two large blocks of _alabastro a\r\npecorella_, brought from the Villa of Hadrian, in the fourth portico\r\nof the Vatican, the largest and most beautiful specimens of this very\r\nrare alabaster in Rome, distinguished by white circular blotches, like\r\na flock of sheep huddled together, on a deep blood-red ground. In the\r\nchurches there are numerous specimens of all the varieties, forming\r\nthe columns and sheathings of altars, memorial chapels, and monuments;\r\nthe incrustations of alabaster on the walls of the Borghese chapel, in\r\nSanta Maria Maggiore, being conspicuous for their splendid effect. The\r\nbaldacchino above the high altar of St. Paul's is supported by four\r\nsplendid columns of Oriental alabaster presented to Gregory XVI. by\r\nMehemet Ali, the viceroy of Egypt. An interesting collection of\r\nbeautiful and valuable varieties of alabasters may be made in\r\nconnection with the building operations still carried on in the\r\nunfinished façade of the basilica fronting the Tiber.\r\n\r\nThe well-known _Verde antico_ is not a marble, but a mixture of the\r\ngreen precious serpentine of mineralogists and white granular\r\nlimestone. It may also be called a breccia, for it is composed of\r\nblack fragments, larger or smaller, derived from other rocks, whose\r\nangular shape indicates that they have not travelled far from the\r\nspots where they occur. The ancient Romans called it _Lapis Atracius_,\r\nfrom Atrax, a town in Thessaly, in the vicinity of which it was found.\r\nIt can hardly be distinguished, except by experts, from the modern\r\ngreen marbles of Vasallo in Sardinia, and Luca in Piedmont. It occurs\r\nsomewhat abundantly in Rome, having been a favourite material with\r\nthe old Romans for sheathing walls and tables. Magnificent columns of\r\nit were introduced into the temples and triumphal arches. We find\r\nrelics of these in the older churches. Four splendid fluted Corinthian\r\ncolumns of Verde antico, with gilded capitals, support the pediment of\r\nthe high altar in Sta. Agnese, in the Piazza Navone, which formerly\r\nbelonged to the Arch of Marcus Aurelius in the Corso. A pair of very\r\nfine columns of this precious stone flank each of the niches,\r\ncontaining statues of the twelve apostles, in the piers which divide\r\nthe middle nave from the side ones in the Church of St. John Lateran.\r\nThese twenty-four columns are remarkable for the clearness of the\r\nwhite, green, and black colours that occur in them. They are supposed\r\nto have been taken from the Baths of Diocletian. Two of the splendid\r\ncomposite columns which support the pediment of the altar in the\r\nCorsini chapel of this church are of this marble, and were also taken\r\nfrom the Arch of Marcus Aurelius in the Corso. One most magnificent\r\ncolumn of Verde antico has been found, along with seven others of\r\ndifferent marbles, in the wall of the narthex of the subterranean\r\nChurch of San Clemente. A small portion of it is polished to show the\r\nbeauty of the material, while the rest is dimmed and incrusted with\r\nthe grime of age.\r\n\r\nVery different from this is the ancient serpentine or ophite of Sparta\r\ncalled the _Lapis Lacedæmonius_, found in different hills near Krokee,\r\nor in Mount Taygetus in Lacedæmon, where the old quarry has recently\r\nbeen opened. It has a base of dark green with angular crystals of\r\nfelspar of a lighter green imbedded in it. It is a truly eruptive\r\nrock, occurring in intrusive bosses, or in beds interstratified with\r\ngneiss and mica-schist, and owes its various shades of green to the\r\npresence of copper. Owing to its extraordinary hardness, this stone\r\nwas seldom used for architectural purposes; and the lapidary will\r\ncharge three times as much for working a fragment of this material\r\ninto a letter-weight as for making it of any other stone. A pair of\r\nfluted Roman Ionic columns, supporting the pediment of the altar of\r\nthe chapel of St. John the Baptist, in the Baptistery of St. John\r\nLateran, are the only examples of ophite pillars in Rome. Next to\r\nthese the largest masses are a circular tablet, forming part of the\r\nsplendid sheathing of one of the ambones in the Church of San Lorenzo;\r\nand two elliptical tablets, still larger, engrafted upon the pilasters\r\nin front of the high altar of St. Paul's.\r\n\r\nThe principal use to which this stone was devoted in Rome was the\r\nconstruction of mosaic pavements. The emperor Alexander Severus\r\nintroduced into his palaces and public buildings a kind of flooring\r\ncomposed of small squares of green serpentine and red porphyry,\r\nwrought into elegant patterns, which became very fashionable, and was\r\ncalled after himself _Opus Alexandrinum_. The infamous Heliogabalus\r\nhad previously paved some of the courts of the Palatine with such\r\nintarsio work, but his cousin Alexander Severus, following his\r\nexample, adorned with it all the terraces and walks around, and the\r\npavements within, the isolated villas called Diætæ, dedicated to his\r\nmother Mammæa, which he added to the Palatine buildings. We have\r\nexamples of this beautiful kind of tesselated pavement in some of the\r\nchambers of the Baths of Caracalla; and it is highly probable that the\r\n_Opus Alexandrinum_ in the transept and middle nave of the Church of\r\nSanta Maria in Trastevere is in part at least contemporaneous with\r\nAlexander Severus, who conceded the ground on which the original\r\noratory stood to Pope Calixtus I. in 222, for the special use of the\r\nChristians. If this be so, we have in this first place of Christian\r\nworship established in Rome the first instance of the application of\r\n_Opus Alexandrinum_ to the decoration of a church. In the middle ages\r\nthe fashion was beautifully imitated by artists of the Cosmati family\r\nand their school; and the mosaic pavements of this kind in the\r\nmedieval churches of Rome are no older than this period. But we have\r\nreason to believe that the _Opus Alexandrinum_ in two of the chapels\r\nof Santa Maria degli Angeli was taken from the Baths of Diocletian;\r\nwhile the splendid pavement of the whole church, naves, transept, and\r\nchoir of Santa Croce in Jerusalemme, formed originally part of the\r\ndecorations of the Sessorian Palace of Sextus Varius, the father of\r\nHeliogabalus, after whom the church is sometimes called the Sessorian\r\nBasilica. The flooring of the whole upper church of San Clemente was\r\ntransferred from the older subterranean church, which derived its\r\npavement from some of the ruins of the Palatine or the Forum; and the\r\nserpentine fragments, which enter very largely into the composition of\r\nthe curious old mosaic floor of Ara Coeli must have had a similar\r\norigin as far back as the time of its founder, Gregory the Great. The\r\n_Lapis Lacedæmonius_ must have been very abundant in Rome during the\r\ntime of Alexander Severus--judging from the quantities that are made\r\nup into mosaics in the churches, and the heaps of broken fragments\r\nthat are found on the Palatine and at the Marmorata. The circular\r\nspace around the obelisk in the Piazza of St. Peter's to a\r\nconsiderable extent is paved with it; and specimens of it frequently\r\noccur among the ordinary road-metal in the city and neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nSicilian jaspers, so called, though really marbles, and purely\r\ncalcareous, because of their resemblance in colour and form of the\r\nblotches to jasper, were wrought in great variety in the quarries in\r\nthe neighbourhood of the celebrated Taormina, and were transported in\r\nthe form of columns to Rome. Siliceous jaspers, obtained from the\r\ncrystalline rocks of Asia Minor, Egypt, and Northern Italy, were also\r\nused for columns; and their brilliant red, green, and yellow hues,\r\nhighly polished, contrasted beautifully with the white marbles of the\r\ninteriors of the palaces. An even more sumptuous material called\r\n_Murrha_ was employed, which has been identified with fluor-spar, a\r\ntranslucent crystalline stone marked with blue, red, and purple,\r\nsimilar to the beautiful substance found near Matlock in Derbyshire.\r\nOf this fluor-spar were formed the celebrated murrhine cups which\r\nwere in use in Rome in the days of Pliny among the richest people, and\r\nfor which fabulous prices were paid. Several blocks of this material\r\nwere found some years ago at the Marmorata which had been originally\r\nimported from Parthia in the reign of Hadrian. One of them was\r\nemployed by the Jesuits, when cut up into thin slices, in ornamenting\r\nthe principal altar in the church of Il Gesu. One of the chambers in\r\nthe Baths of Titus was paved with slabs of the finest lapis\r\nlazula--the _Lapis Cyanus_ of the ancients--derived from the spoils of\r\nthe Golden House of Nero, and originally procured by order of the\r\nluxurious tyrant from Persia and the neighbourhood of Lake Baikal. We\r\ncan trace fragments of this exquisite pavement in the decoration of\r\nthe chapel of St. Ignatius in the Church of the Jesuits. The globe,\r\nthree feet in diameter, over the altar, beneath which repose the\r\nremains of Ignatius Loyola, is sheathed with this most precious stone,\r\nwhose brilliant blue, contrasting with the white marble of the group\r\nof the Trinity--one of whose members holds it in His hands--has a\r\nsplendid effect. The rare and costly marbles with which the Church of\r\nIl Gesu is profusely adorned were mostly taken from the ruins of the\r\nBaths of Titus by Cardinal Farnese in 1568. From the same source came\r\nalso the magnificent sarcophagus, sheathed with lapis lazula, under\r\nthe altar of St. Ignazio, which holds the body of St. Luigi Gonzaga.\r\n\r\nBut it is impossible, within the limits of this chapter, to describe\r\nfully the relics of other precious and beautiful stones which may be\r\nfound among the ruins of ancient Rome, or among the churches to which\r\nthey have been transferred. Profuse as were the ancient Romans in\r\ntheir general expenditure, upon no objects did they lavish their\r\nwealth so extravagantly as upon their favourite marbles and precious\r\nstones for the decoration of their public buildings and their private\r\nhouses. No effort was spared that Rome might be adorned with the\r\nrichest treasures of the mineral kingdom from all parts of the world.\r\nSlaves and criminals were made to minister to this luxury in the\r\nvarious quarries of the Roman dominions, which were the penal\r\nsettlements of antiquity. The antiquary Ficoroni counted the columns\r\nin Rome in the year 1700, and he found no less than eight thousand\r\nexisting entire; and yet these were but a very small proportion of the\r\nnumber that must once have been there. The palaces and modern churches\r\nof Rome owe, as I have said, all their ornaments to this passion of\r\nthe ancients. There is not a doorstep nor a guardstone at the corner\r\nof the meanest court in Rome which is not of marble, granite, or\r\nporphyry from some ancient building. Almost all the houses, as Raphael\r\nsaid, have been built with lime made of the costly old marbles. The\r\nvery streets in the newly-formed parts of the city are macadamised\r\nwith the fragments of costly baths and pillars. I took up one day, out\r\nof curiosity, some of the road-metal near the Church of Santa Maria\r\nMaggiore, and I identified in the handful no less than a dozen\r\nvarieties of the most beautiful marbles and porphyries from Greece,\r\nAfrica, and Asia. And when we remember that all these foreign stones\r\nwere brought into Rome during the interval between the end of the\r\nRepublic and the time of Constantine--a period of between three\r\nhundred and four hundred years--we can form some idea of the\r\nextraordinary wealth and luxury of the Imperial City when it was in\r\nits prime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE VATICAN CODEX\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the numberless objects of interest to be seen in Rome, a very\r\nhigh place must be assigned to the Codex Vaticanus, probably the\r\noldest vellum manuscript in existence, and the richest treasure of the\r\ngreat Vatican Library. This famous manuscript, which Biblical scholars\r\ndesignate by the letter B, contains the oldest copy of the Septuagint,\r\nand the first Greek version of the New Testament. In addition to the\r\nprofound interest which its own intrinsic value has inspired, it has\r\nbeen invested with a halo of romance seldom associated with dry\r\npalæographical studies--on account of the unreasonable jealousy and\r\ncapricious conduct of its guardians. For a long time it was altogether\r\ninaccessible for study to Biblical scholars, and few were allowed even\r\nto see it. These restrictions, however, have now happily to a\r\nconsiderable extent been removed; and provided with an order, easily\r\nobtained from the Vatican librarian, or from the Prefect of the sacred\r\npalaces, in reply to a polite note, any respectable person is\r\npermitted to inspect it.\r\n\r\nThe first feeling which one has in the Vatican Library is that of\r\nsurprise. You might walk through the Great Hall and adjoining\r\ngalleries without suspecting the place to be a library at all; for the\r\nbookcases that line the lower portion of the walls are closed with\r\npanelled doors, painted in arabesque on a ground of white and slate\r\ncolour, and surrounded by gilded mouldings, and not a single book is\r\nvisible. The vaulted ceiling of the rooms is glowing with gold and\r\nultramarine; the walls are adorned with beautiful frescoes\r\nrepresenting the different Councils of the Church; and magnificent\r\ntables of polished Oriental granite, and of various precious marbles,\r\nvases of porphyry, malachite, and alabaster, and priceless candelabra\r\nof Sevres china--the gifts of kings and emperors--occupy the spaces\r\nbetween the pillars and pilasters, and cast their rich shadows on the\r\ngleaming marble pavement. A vast variety of objects of rare beauty,\r\nartistic value, and antique interest arrest the attention, and would\r\namply reward the study of weeks.\r\n\r\nThe nucleus of the present magnificent collection of books and\r\nmanuscripts was formed in the Lateran Palace in the year 465 by Bishop\r\nHilary; and, augmented by succeeding pontiffs, the accumulated stores\r\nwere transferred in 1450 by Pope Nicholas V., the founder of Glasgow\r\nUniversity, to the Vatican. What Nicholas began was completed by\r\nSixtus IV. The library was classified according to subjects and\r\nwriters, and Demetrius Lucensis, under the direction of Platina, made\r\na catalogue of it which is still in existence. During this period\r\nVatican MSS. were lent out to students, as attested by authentic\r\nregisters containing the autographs of those who enjoyed the\r\nprivilege. A little later the celebrated Vatican printing press was\r\nannexed to the library; and the office of correctors or readers for\r\nthe accurate printing of ancient books which were wanting in the\r\nlibrary was instituted. Pope Sixtus V. erected the present splendid\r\nedifice, and used every effort to increase the great collection.\r\nSeveral valuable accessions were made to it after this date, including\r\nthe library of the Elector Palatine of Germany, the library of the\r\nDukes of Urbino, the libraries of Christina, Queen of Sweden, of the\r\nOttoboni, commenced by Pope Alexander VIII., and of the Marquis\r\nCapponi, and the MSS. taken from the convent of S. Basilio at Grotta\r\nFerrata. Under Innocent XIII. in 1721 an attempt was made to prepare\r\nfor the press a full catalogue of all the MSS. in every language. It\r\nwas edited by Joseph Simon Assemani and Stephen Evodius, and three\r\nvolumes were published. But the task was found too great for any one's\r\nstrength, and was given up finally on account of the political\r\ndisturbances of the time.\r\n\r\nThe library is a vast unexplored mine of wealth. Unknown literary\r\ntreasures are contained in the closed cabinets. Among the thirty\r\nthousand manuscripts may be hid some of the ancient classical and\r\nearly Christian treatises, which have been lost for ages, and whose\r\nrecovery would excite the profoundest interest throughout the\r\ncivilised world. A large number of these manuscripts had once belonged\r\nto the library of the famous Monastery of Bobbio, in the north of\r\nItaly, founded in the year 614 by the Irish St. Columbanus. The Irish\r\nand Scotch monks who inhabited this monastery were in the dark ages\r\nthe most zealous collectors of manuscripts in Europe. At the close of\r\nthe fifteenth century the convent was impoverished and deserted by its\r\nlawful occupants; and the Benedictine monks who succeeded them gave\r\naway their literary treasures partly to the Ambrosian Library at Milan\r\nand partly to the Vatican Library. Cardinal Angelo Mai, who discovered\r\nmore lost works and transcribed more ancient manuscripts than any one\r\nelse, found among these treasures in Milan and Rome several most\r\ninteresting treatises that had long passed into utter oblivion.\r\n\r\nBut though permission is freely granted to duly accredited visitors\r\nwho may be desirous of consulting manuscripts, the labour of searching\r\namong the huge bewildering piles would be overwhelming, and the\r\nthought of it would at once paralyse effort. There is no proper\r\ncatalogue of the printed books; and the list of manuscripts is so\r\ndeficient as to be altogether worthless. During six months, from\r\nNovember till June, the library is open for study every day, except\r\nThursday and the numerous saints' days, whose recurrence can be\r\neasily ascertained beforehand so as to prevent disappointment. I\r\ncannot imagine a greater privilege to a student. It is the highest\r\nluxury of learning to explore the literary wealth of these princely\r\napartments, that seem to have a climate of their own, like the great\r\nBasilica close at hand--the climate of eternal spring--and whose\r\natmosphere breathes the associations of much that is grandest and most\r\nmemorable in human history. To the charms of some of the noblest\r\nproductions of human genius working by pen, or pencil, or\r\nchisel--adorning roof, and wall, and floor--and vanishing down the\r\nlong vista in a bright perspective of beauty--Nature adds her crown of\r\nperfection. For nothing can exceed the loveliness of the views from\r\nthe windows of the Papal gardens outside, with their gay flowery\r\nparterres, sparkling fountains, depths of shadowy glades and\r\nhalf-hidden sculptured forms of rarest beauty; and, beyond, a purple\r\nmountain range, summits old in story, closing up the enchanted vista\r\nthrough the ruddy stems and deep green foliage of tall stone-pines;\r\nthe whole glowing in the brilliant sunshine and the exquisite violet\r\ntransparency of the Roman sky. How delightful to spend whole days\r\nthere and forget the commonplace present in converse with the master\r\nminds of the ages, and in dreams of the heroic past; the half-closed\r\nshutters and drawn curtains producing a cool and drowsy atmosphere, in\r\ndelicious contrast with the broiling sun without! Learning, however,\r\nwould be too apt to fall asleep, and be shorn of its strength on the\r\nDelilah lap of such splendid luxury.\r\n\r\nA few of the most interesting books and manuscripts are now contained\r\nin two handsome cabinets placed in the centre of the Great Hall of the\r\nlibrary. These cabinets have two cases, an outer and an inner one, and\r\nare carefully double-locked. The librarian opened them for me, and\r\ndisplayed their contents, which are usually seen only through a thick\r\nplate of protecting glass. In the one cabinet were a manuscript of the\r\nLatin poet Terence, of the fourth and fifth century; the celebrated\r\npalimpsest of Cicero de Republica, concealed under a version of St.\r\nAugustine's Commentary on the Psalms, the oldest Latin manuscript in\r\nexistence; the famous Virgil of the fifth century, with the well-known\r\nportrait of Virgil; the Homilies of St. Gregory of Nazianzum; the\r\nfolio Hebrew Bible, which was the only thing that Duke Frederico of\r\nUrbino reserved for himself of the spoil at the capture of Volterra in\r\n1472, and for which the Jews in Venice offered its weight in gold; a\r\nsketch of the first three cantos of the Gerusalemme Liberata in the\r\nhandwriting of Tasso; a copy of Dante in the handwriting of Boccaccio;\r\nand several of Petrarch's autograph sonnets. In the other cabinet is\r\nthe great gem and glory of the Library--the Codex Vaticanus, in\r\nstrange association with a number of the love-letters of Henry\r\nVIII. and Anne Boleyn, in French and English. This curious\r\ncorrespondence--which, after all that subsequently happened between\r\nthe English monarch and the Papal Court, we are very much surprised to\r\nsee in such a place--is in wonderful preservation. But though\r\nperfectly legible, the archaic form of the characters and the numerous\r\nabbreviations make it extremely difficult to decipher them. The tragic\r\nending of this most inauspicious love-making invests with a deep\r\npathos these faded yellow records of it that seem like the cold, gray\r\nashes of a once glowing fire. In the same cabinet is seen another and\r\naltogether different production of this royal author--namely, the\r\ndedication copy of the \"Assertio Septem Sacramentorum adversus\r\nMartinum Luther,\" written in Latin by Henry VIII. in defence of the\r\nseven Roman Catholic Sacraments against Luther, and sent to Leo X.,\r\nwith the original presentation address and royal autograph. The book\r\nis a good thick octavo volume, printed in London, in clear type, on\r\nvellum, with a broad margin. Only two copies are in existence, one in\r\nthe Bodleian Library at Oxford, and the other in the Vatican. For this\r\ntheological dissertation Henry VIII. received from the Pope the title\r\nof \"Defender of the Faith,\" which has descended to the Protestant\r\nmonarchs of England ever since, and is now inscribed on our coinage.\r\nLuther, several of whose manuscripts are in the Library, published a\r\nvigorous reply, in which he treated his royal opponent with scant\r\nceremony. The author himself had no scruple in setting it aside when\r\nhis personal passions were aroused. And Rome has put this inconsistent\r\nbook beside the letters to Anne Boleyn, as it were in the pillory here\r\nfor the condemnation of the world.\r\n\r\nBut deeply interesting as were these literary curiosities, I soon\r\nturned from them and became engrossed with the priceless manuscript of\r\nthe Greek Scriptures. I had very little time to inspect it, for I was\r\nafraid to exhaust the patience of the librarian. In appearance the\r\nmanuscript is a quarto volume bound in red morocco; each of the pages\r\nbeing about eleven inches long, and the same in breadth. This is the\r\nusual size of the greater number of ancient manuscripts, very few\r\nbeing in folio or octavo, and in this particular resembling printed\r\nbooks. Each page has three columns, containing seventeen or eighteen\r\nletters in a line. It is supposed that this arrangement of the writing\r\nwas borrowed directly from the most primitive scrolls, whose leaves\r\nwere joined together lengthwise, so that their contents always\r\nappeared in parallel columns, as we see in the papyrus rolls that have\r\nrecently been discovered. This peculiarity in the two or three\r\nmanuscripts which possess it, is regarded as a proof of their very\r\nhigh antiquity. The writing on almost every page is so clear and\r\ndistinct that it can be read with the greatest ease.\r\n\r\nWhat astonishes one most is the admirable preservation of this Codex,\r\nnotwithstanding that it must be nearly sixteen hundred years old. It\r\nhas quite a fresh and recent look; indeed many manuscripts not fifty\r\nyears old look much more ancient. No one, looking at the faded\r\nhandwriting of Tasso, Petrarch, and Henry VIII., beside it, would\r\nimagine that they were newer by upwards of twelve hundred years. This\r\npeculiarity it shares in common with the architectural remains of\r\nimperial Rome, which time has dealt so tenderly with that they appear\r\nfar more recent than the picturesque ruins of our medieval castles and\r\nabbeys. This singular look of freshness in the Vatican manuscript is\r\nowing to three causes. In the first place, the vellum upon which it is\r\nwritten is exceedingly fine and close-grained in texture, and\r\ntherefore has resisted the dust and discoloration of centuries, just\r\nas the thin and close-grained Roman brick has withstood the ravages of\r\ntime. Every one is struck with the wonderful beauty of this vellum,\r\ncomposed of the delicate skins of very young calves. And this feature\r\nis a further proof of the high antiquity of the Codex, for the oldest\r\nmanuscripts are invariably written on the thinnest and whitest vellum,\r\nwhile those of later ages are written on thick and rough parchment\r\nwhich speedily became discoloured. In the second place, we have reason\r\nto believe that the manuscript was for many ages almost hermetically\r\nsealed in some forgotten recess of the Lateran and Vatican Libraries,\r\nand thus unconsciously guarded from the attacks of time. In the third\r\nplace, a careful scrutiny of the individual lines reveals the curious\r\nfact that the whole manuscript, six or seven centuries after it had\r\nbeen written, was gone over by a writer, who, finding the letters\r\nfaint and yellow, had touched them up with a blacker and more\r\npermanent ink.\r\n\r\nIt is a strange circumstance that none of the facsimile\r\nrepresentations of the pages of the manuscript that have been\r\npublished give a correct idea of the original, with the exception of\r\nthat of Dean Burgon in 1871. Not only do the number of lines in a\r\ngiven space in all the so-called facsimiles differ from that of the\r\nmanuscript, but the general character of the letters is widely\r\ndifferent. The importance of seeing the original, therefore, for\r\npurposes of study, is apparent. The uncial letters are very small and\r\nneat, upright and regular, and their breadth is nearly equal to their\r\nheight. They are very like those in the manuscript rolls of\r\nHerculaneum. Originally the manuscript had no ornamental initial\r\nletters, marks of punctuation, or accents; a small interval of the\r\nbreadth of a letter at the end of particular sections serving as a\r\nsimple mode of punctuation. The number of such divisions into sections\r\nis very considerable,--one hundred and seventy occurring in St.\r\nMatthew; sixty-one in St. Mark; one hundred and fifty-two in St. Luke;\r\nand eighty in St. John,--and in this respect the Vatican Codex is\r\nunique. Where these divisions do not occur, the writing is continuous\r\nfor several consecutive pages. Thus, while each of the beatitudes,\r\neach of the parables, and each of the series of generations in the\r\ngenealogies of our Lord, are marked off into separate paragraphs by\r\nthe small empty spaces referred to, there is no break in the text from\r\nthe twenty-fourth verse of the seventeenth chapter of the Gospel of\r\nSt. Matthew to the seventeenth verse of the twentieth chapter. So much\r\nhas space been economised, that when the writer finished one book he\r\nbegan another at the top of the very next column; and throughout the\r\nmanuscript there are very few breaks, and only one entire column left\r\nblank. This empty space is very significant; it occurs at the end of\r\nthe eighth verse of the sixteenth chapter of St. Mark's Gospel,--thus\r\nomitting altogether the last twelve verses with which we are familiar.\r\nThat this was done purposely is evident, for it involved a departure\r\nfrom the writer's usual method of continuous writing. The blank column\r\ntestifies that he knew of the existence of this gap at the end of the\r\nGospel, but did not know of any thoroughly trustworthy material with\r\nwhich to fill it up. And acting upon this authority our Revisers have\r\nprinted the passage that has been supplied as an appendix, and not as\r\na portion of the original Gospel of St. Mark. The only attempt at\r\nornamentation in the Vatican manuscript is found at the end of\r\nLamentations, Ezekiel, St. John's Gospel, and the Acts of the\r\nApostles, where \"an arabesque column of crossed lines, with dots in\r\nthe intersections at the edge,\" and surmounted by the well-known\r\nmonogram of Christ, so frequent in the inscriptions of the Catacombs,\r\ncomposed of the letter P in a cruciform shape, has been delicately and\r\nskilfully executed by the pen of the scribe. Most of the books have\r\nalso brief titles and subscriptions.\r\n\r\nSuch was the original state of the Codex, but the critic of the ninth\r\nor tenth century already referred to introduced a great many changes.\r\nNot only did he deepen the colour of the ink; he, as Dean Burgon tells\r\nus, also accentuated the words carefully throughout, marking all the\r\ninitial vowels with their proper breathings. He also placed instead of\r\nthe small initial letter of each book an illuminated capital six times\r\nthe size of the original uncial, painted in bright red and blue\r\ncolours which have still retained nearly all their old brilliancy. At\r\nthe top of the column, whenever a new book commenced, he also placed a\r\nbroad bar painted in green, with three little red crosses above it.\r\nNor was this all; he exercised his critical judgment in revising the\r\ntext, and marking his approval or disapproval by certain significant\r\nindications. \"What he approved of he touched up anew with ink, and\r\nadded the proper accents; what he condemned he left in the faded brown\r\ncaligraphy of the original and without accentuation.\" In this way the\r\nCodex may be called a kind of palimpsest, in which we have some\r\nportions of the original manuscript, and the rest overlaid with the\r\nlater revision. We must discriminate carefully between these two\r\nelements; for it is obvious that it is the oldest portion that is most\r\ninteresting and suggestive.\r\n\r\nThe Codex consists of upwards of one thousand five hundred pages, of\r\nwhich two hundred and eighty-four are assigned to the New Testament.\r\nOriginally it contained the whole Bible, and also the Apocrypha and\r\nthe Epistle of St. Clement to the Corinthians; which last was so much\r\nesteemed by the early Christians that it was regularly read in the\r\nchurches, and bound up with the Scriptures--to which circumstance,\r\nindeed, we are indebted for its preservation to our own time. At\r\npresent the greater part of Genesis and a part of the Psalms are\r\nmissing from the old Testament; while, in the New Testament, the\r\nEpistle to Philemon, the three Pastoral Epistles, the latter part of\r\nthe Epistle to the Hebrews, and the Apocalypse, in the original\r\nhandwriting, are lost; their place having been supplied, it is said,\r\nin the fifteenth century, from a manuscript belonging to Cardinal\r\nBessarion. From the evidence of its materials--arrangement and style\r\nof writing--the very high antiquity of this Codex may be inferred. It\r\nis generally supposed to have been written in the beginning of the\r\nfourth century. Vercellone, who edited Cardinal Mai's version of it,\r\nargues, from the remarkable correspondence of its text with that used\r\nby Cyril of Alexandria in his Commentary on St. John, that it must\r\nhave been written at Alexandria, where there was a band of remarkably\r\nskilful caligraphists. He believes that it was one of the fifty\r\nmanuscript copies of the Holy Scriptures which Eusebius, by order of\r\nthe emperor Constantine the Great, got prepared in the year 332 for\r\nthe use of the Christian Church in the newly-formed capital of\r\nConstantinople. And a circumstance that seems to corroborate this\r\nopinion is, that the Vatican Codex does not contain, as has already\r\nbeen mentioned, the last twelve verses of St. Mark's Gospel, a\r\npeculiarity which Eusebius says belongs to the best manuscripts of the\r\nGospels. On this supposition, the Vatican Codex would be the very\r\nfirst edition of the Bible that had the seal of a sovereign authority.\r\n\r\nBut it may be of even older date than the time of Constantine, for its\r\nmarginal references do not correspond with the Eusebian canons; and\r\nthis fact would seem to imply that it belonged to the third century.\r\nIts only rival in point of antiquity is the famous Sinaitic Codex,\r\nknown by the Hebrew letter [Hebrew: alef], discovered in a most\r\nromantic way by Tischendorf in the Convent of St. Catherine on Mount\r\nSinai. Tischendorf has pronounced a decided opinion, not only that\r\nthis manuscript is of the same age as the Vatican one, but that the\r\nVatican manuscript was written by one of the four writers who, he\r\ninfers from internal evidence, must have been employed upon the\r\nSinaitic Codex. This opinion, however, has been disputed by other\r\nscholars; and it seems improbable, for the Sinaitic Codex has four\r\ncolumns to the page, whereas the Vatican Codex has only three. Its\r\nuncial letters are also much larger and plainer than those of the\r\nVatican manuscript; and it has the Ammonian sections and Eusebian\r\ncanons written in all probability by the original hand.\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that the Vatican manuscript goes, if not\r\nfarther, at least as far back in date as the Council of Nice, and is\r\nthe oldest and most valuable of extant monuments of sacred antiquity.\r\nIt may have been transcribed directly from some Egyptian papyrus, or\r\nthrough the medium of only one intervening prototype. Perhaps it was a\r\nsingle copy saved from the fate of many surrendered to be burned by\r\nthe class of Christian renegades called _traditores_, who averted the\r\nmartyr's death in the great Diocletian persecution by giving up the\r\nsacred books of their religion to their enemies. For this pagan\r\nemperor endeavoured not only to deprive the Christian Church of its\r\nteachers, like his predecessors, but also to destroy the sacred\r\nwritings upon which the faith of the Church was founded, and whose\r\ncharacter and claims were beginning at this time to be generally\r\nrecognised. The Alexandrine Codex--which is placed first on the list\r\nof uncial manuscripts, and therefore distinguished by the letter\r\nA--belongs undoubtedly to a more recent time. It is said by tradition\r\nto have been written by a noble Egyptian martyr named Thecla about the\r\nbeginning of the fifth century, and was sent as a present to Charles\r\nI. by Cyrillus Lucaris, patriarch of Constantinople, who brought it\r\nfrom Alexandria. It is now one of the greatest treasures of the\r\nBritish Museum. The voice of tradition is confirmed by internal\r\nevidence, for it has only two columns in a page, while capital letters\r\nof different sizes abound, and vermilion is frequently introduced--all\r\nmarks of the period indicated.\r\n\r\nHow or when the Codex Vaticanus was brought to the Vatican Library is\r\na matter that is altogether involved in obscurity. It probably formed\r\npart of the library in the Lateran Palace, which goes nearly as far\r\nback as the time of Constantine, and was transferred along with the\r\nother contents of that library to the Vatican in 1450 by Pope Nicholas\r\nV. We first hear of it distinctly in a letter written to Erasmus in\r\n1533 by Sepulveda; although there is a somewhat obscure reference to\r\nit a few years earlier in the correspondence of the Papal librarian\r\nBombasius with Erasmus. A Roman edition of the Septuagint portion\r\nbased upon the Vatican MS. appeared in 1587. After that period to 1780\r\nit was several times collated; among others, by Bartolocci, the\r\nVatican librarian; by Bentley, who employed for the purpose the Abbate\r\nMico and Rulotta; and by Birch of Copenhagen, who travelled under the\r\nauspices of the King of Denmark. Along with many of the best\r\nsculptures and most valuable art-treasures of the Vatican, the\r\nprecious Codex was taken to Paris in 1810 by order of Napoleon\r\nBuonaparte, that unscrupulous robber of foreign palaces and churches\r\nfor the aggrandisement of his own capital; and while there it was\r\ncarefully examined by the celebrated critic, J.L. Hug, who was the\r\nfirst to determine, from the nature of its materials and its internal\r\nevidence, its very great antiquity. When it was restored, along with\r\nthe other spoils of the great Roman Palace, it was sealed up by its\r\njealous possessors, and could no longer be consulted for critical\r\npurposes. In 1843 Tischendorf could only see it for two days of\r\nthree hours each. Tregelles, who went to Rome in 1845 for the\r\nspecial purpose of consulting the Codex, provided with a\r\nstrongly-recommendatory letter of introduction from Cardinal Wiseman,\r\nwas only permitted to see it, but not to transcribe any of its\r\nreadings. His pockets, as he himself tells us, were searched, and his\r\npen, ink, and paper taken away, before he was allowed to open it; and\r\nif he looked at a passage too long the manuscript was snatched rudely\r\nfrom his hands by the two prelates in watchful attendance. When Dean\r\nAlford, in 1861, made use of the manuscript for four days, his labours\r\nof collation were carried on in the face of much opposition from the\r\nlibrarian, who insisted that the order of Antonelli permitted him only\r\nto see the manuscript, but not to verify passages in it.\r\n\r\nThe reason alleged to the scholars of Europe for this childish\r\njealousy was that the authorities of the Vatican were themselves\r\npreparing to publish a thorough collation, and they did not wish the\r\nglory of the achievement to pass away from Rome. Cardinal Mai began,\r\nindeed, to prepare an edition for publication in 1828; but it did not\r\nappear till 1857, three years after the cardinal's death, under the\r\nlearned editorship of Vercellone. There was a rumour copied into the\r\n_Edinburgh Review_ from Sir Charles Lyell's work on the United States,\r\nthat the cardinal was prevented from publishing his work by Pope\r\nGregory XVI., on account of its variations from the Vulgate, which had\r\nbeen solemnly sanctioned by the decrees of the Council of Trent and\r\nthe Church's claims to infallibility. It was further asserted that he\r\nfinally obtained permission to publish his edition on condition that\r\nhe inserted within brackets the celebrated text 1 John v. 7, which was\r\nwanting in the manuscript. Whether this was true or not, it is certain\r\nthat what the learned cardinal gave to the world was more an edition,\r\na critical recension of the text, than a faithful transcript of the\r\nVatican Codex. Although he had the MS. with him at his residence in\r\nthe Palazzo Altieri--a circumstance which gave rise to the belief at\r\nthe time that it had disappeared during the French occupation of\r\nRome--he could only bestow upon the arduous task the scanty leisure\r\navailable from more engrossing duties. The work was therefore so\r\nimperfectly done that the cardinal himself was reluctant to publish\r\nit; and the learned and honest Barnabite under whose editorial\r\nauspices it appeared was obliged to append a formidable list of\r\nerrata, and to make a gentle apology in his preface for his friend's\r\ninaccuracies. But, with all its defects, the five quarto volumes of\r\nthe cardinal's reprint has added largely to our critical knowledge of\r\nthe Codex; and it derives a special interest from the circumstance\r\nthat it was the first time the Greek Scriptures had ever been\r\npublished in Rome.\r\n\r\nSince then Tischendorf, during his second visit to the Eternal City,\r\nhad an audience of Pope Pius IX., and offered to bring out at his own\r\nexpense an edition of the Vatican Codex similar to that which he had\r\nprepared, under the auspices of the Russian emperor, of the Sinaitic\r\nCodex. This request the Pope refused, under the old pretext that he\r\nwished to publish such an edition himself. Tischendorf, however, was\r\nallowed to use the manuscript more freely than on the former occasion;\r\nthough several times it was taken away from him, and his labours\r\ninterrupted, because of alleged breaches of faith on his part. The\r\nresult of this unusual privilege was that the great Textuary has\r\nissued by far the most accurate and satisfactory edition which we\r\npossess at present. Pius IX. carried out his intention of publishing a\r\nRoman edition in five volumes, printed by the famous press of the\r\nPropaganda. The New Testament instalment appeared under the editorship\r\nof Vercellone and Cozza in 1868; but Vercellone dying soon after, the\r\nsubsequent volumes were prepared under less able supervision. The\r\nfamous manuscript therefore labours under the disadvantage of\r\nuncertainty, there being no guarantee that any reading is really that\r\nof the original. And while the Alexandrine Codex has been reproduced\r\nby photography, and the Sinaitic Codex has been faithfully published,\r\nthe exact palæography, or the genuine text as it stands, of the\r\nVatican Codex is still a desideratum among scholars.\r\n\r\nThe total disappearance of all manuscripts previous to the Vatican\r\nCodex is a matter of surprise, for it has been calculated on\r\nsufficient evidence that many thousands of copies of the Gospels were\r\ncirculated among Christians at the end of the second century. The loss\r\nmay be attributed to the fact that the older manuscripts were written\r\non less enduring materials. Previous to the second century the\r\nprincipal writing material was paper made of papyrus, a plant found at\r\none time not only in Egypt, but also in the north of Palestine and\r\nvarious parts of southern Italy and Sicily, although now almost\r\nextirpated; and we have reason to believe, from one or two incidental\r\nnotices in St. John's writings, that it was the material employed by\r\nthe apostles themselves. This papyrus paper was of a very perishable\r\nnature, and manuscripts written on it, apart from the wear and tear of\r\ncontinual use, would succumb to the process of decay in a\r\ncomparatively short period. We are indebted for the preservation of\r\nall the papyrus manuscripts that have come down to us from a remote\r\nantiquity to the fact of their having been kept in exceptionally\r\nfavourable circumstances, as in the hermetically-sealed interiors of\r\nEgyptian tombs. Those exposed to the air have all disappeared ages\r\nago. In the second century parchment was brought into common use as a\r\nwriting material, and papyrus paper gradually fell into disuse. And\r\nwith the change of material the shape of manuscripts was changed; the\r\nancient form of the papyrus-roll giving place, in manuscripts written\r\non parchment, to the form of books with leaves. How we should value\r\nthe original rolls which contained the handwriting of the evangelists\r\nand apostles! With what profound interest should we gaze upon the\r\nsignature and salutation of St. Paul affixed to the Epistles which he\r\ndictated to an amanuensis on account of his defective eyesight! How we\r\nshould prize the apostolic autograph of the Epistle to the Galatians,\r\nof which the writer says, \"Ye see how large a letter I have written\r\nunto you with mine own hand.\" What a thrill would pass through us at\r\nthe sight of those two pastoral Epistles, at the close of which St.\r\nJohn says,--\"I had many things to write, but I will not with pen and\r\nink write unto thee\"! Our legitimate veneration, however, would be apt\r\nto pass over into idolatrous superstition. We should worship such\r\nprecious documents as the early Christians worshipped the relics of\r\nthe saints. It was, therefore, a wise providential arrangement that\r\nsuch a temptation should have been taken out of the way. All the\r\noriginal manuscripts of the sacred writings disappeared, on account of\r\nthe fragile character of their materials, probably in a few years\r\nafter the death of the writers, no special care having been taken to\r\npreserve them; and, as Dr. Westcott has remarked, not a single\r\nauthentic appeal is made to them in the religious disputes regarding\r\nthe exact words of certain passages in the Gospels and Epistles in the\r\nwritings of the second century.\r\n\r\nBut though the Vatican Codex is the oldest manuscript of the New\r\nTestament in existence, it does not follow from that circumstance that\r\nit is the most reliable. Widely different views of its critical value\r\nare entertained by scholars. By some it has been accepted as the most\r\nauthoritative of all versions, while others have regarded it as one of\r\nthe most corrupt and imperfect. Indeed the conjecture has been\r\nhazarded that the very circumstance of its continued preservation\r\nduring so many centuries is a proof that it was an unreliable copy\r\nlong laid aside, and therefore exempt from the wear and tear under\r\nwhich genuine copies of the same date have long ago perished. These\r\nextreme views, however, are unjust. While it is not free from many\r\ngross inaccuracies and faults, it presents upon the whole a very fair\r\nidea of the Greek Vulgate of the early Church, and is worthy of as\r\nmuch respect at least as any single document in existence. The chief\r\npeculiarity of the Codex is the large number of important omissions in\r\nit; so that, as Dr. Dobbin says, it presents an abbreviated text of\r\nthe New Testament. A few of these omissions were wilfully made, while\r\nthe large majority were no doubt caused by the carelessness of the\r\nwriter in transcribing from the copy before him; for there are several\r\ninstances of his having written the same words and clauses twice over.\r\nOn the supposition of the MS. being one of the fifty prepared at\r\nConstantine's order, the extreme haste with which such a task would be\r\nexecuted would account for the multitude of clerical errors. Besides\r\nthe last verses of the Gospel of St. Mark already alluded to, and no\r\nless than three hundred and sixty-four other omissions in the same\r\nGospel of greater or less moment, the doxology at the end of the\r\nLord's Prayer, in Matthew vi. 13, is wanting; as also the description\r\nof the agony of the Saviour and the help of the angel in Luke xxii.\r\n43, 44; the important clause, \"For he was before me,\" in John i. 27;\r\nthe miraculous troubling of the water in the Pool of Bethesda in John\r\nv. 3, 4; the narrative of the adulterous woman in John vii. 53 to\r\nviii. 11; the question of Philip and the answer of the Ethiopian\r\neunuch in Acts viii. 37; the significant and affecting incidents in\r\nPaul's conversion mentioned in Acts ix. 5, 6; and the well-known\r\ndisputed text of the _Three witnesses in Heaven_, in 1 John v. 7.\r\nThese omitted passages, which, from internal evidence, apart from the\r\nexternal testimony of the largest number of critical documents, we\r\nmust acknowledge to be genuine, are the most serious of the lacunæ,\r\namounting altogether to the extraordinary number of two thousand four\r\nhundred and fifty-six. They give the document a very distinctive\r\ncharacter; while even the less striking disappearances from the text,\r\nwhich can only be apprehended on a close collation, more or less\r\naffect the sense. German critics have stamped several of these\r\nomissions with their approbation, especially those referring to the\r\nsupernatural, owing to their well-known repugnance to the miraculous\r\nelement in Scripture.\r\n\r\nThere are other peculiarities of the Codex which greatly interested me;\r\nbut the discussion of them would require me to go too much into critical\r\ndetails. I must mention, however, the occasional use in the manuscript\r\nof a Latinised orthography. The name of Silvanus, for instance,\r\nmentioned in 1 Peter v. 12, is rendered into the Latinised Greek\r\n_Silbanou_, instead of Silouanou, the common Greek form; and in 2 Peter\r\niii. 10, instead of the last word of the verse, _katakaêsetai_, \"shall\r\nbe burned up,\" occurs the singular word _eurethesetai_,--which means,\r\n\"shall be found.\" The Syriac and one Egyptian version have the reading\r\n\"shall not be found\"; and either the \"not\" was accidentally omitted when\r\nthe Vatican Codex was copied from an earlier exemplar that had that\r\nreading, or the writer had some confused idea of the Latin word\r\n_urerentur_, \"shall be burnt up,\" in his mind, and adopted the word\r\n_eurethesetai_ from its resemblance to it--as a Latin root with a Greek\r\ninflection. Some curious examples of Latin forms and constructions might\r\nbe given; and this circumstance has led to the hypothesis that the\r\norigin of the Vatican manuscript might, after all, have been Italian,\r\nand not Alexandrian as is commonly supposed. The Codex has also been\r\naccused of theological bias; for in John i. 18, \"only begotten God\" is\r\nsubstituted for \"only begotten Son.\" This is considered by some to be a\r\nreference to the polemics of the fourth century regarding the Arian\r\ndoctrines; although this supposition would make it of later date. The\r\norder of the books of the New Testament in the Codex is different from\r\nthat with which we are familiar. The Catholic Epistles from James to\r\nJude follow the Acts, according to the order of the ancient Greek\r\nChurch; then come the Pauline Epistles; and the Epistle to the Hebrews\r\ncomes in between the Second Epistle to the Thessalonians and First\r\nTimothy. Its sections, however, are numbered as if it had originally\r\nbeen placed between the Epistles to the Galatians and Ephesians; thus\r\nshowing that this was the arrangement in the older document from which\r\nthe Codex was copied. One of the Moscow manuscripts, it may be\r\nmentioned in connection with this novelty in location, places the\r\nEpistle to the Hebrews in a position as abnormal as in the Vatican\r\nmanuscript--namely, before the Epistle to the Romans.\r\n\r\nIn the formation of the Received Text of our New Testament, the\r\nVatican manuscript was not employed. The basis of the early printed\r\neditions--the Elzevir and those of Robert Stephens the celebrated\r\nParisian printer--was the Greek New Testament of Erasmus, published in\r\n1516, compiled with the aid of such manuscripts as he found at Basle,\r\nand the Complutensian Polyglot--so called after Complutum, the modern\r\nAlcala, in Spain, where it was printed in 1522, under the patronage of\r\nCardinal Ximenes, whose text was said to have been formed from\r\nmanuscripts sent from the Papal Library at Rome--the Vatican Codex\r\ncertainly not being among the number, as abundantly appears from\r\ninternal evidence. But though the Vatican manuscript was not employed\r\nin the construction of our Authorised Version, it has recently been\r\nused as the chief authority by the New Testament Revisers. Drs.\r\nWestcott and Hort have built up their Greek text with special\r\ndeferential regard to it; and this exclusive devotion has been\r\nseverely condemned by several critics, such as Dean Burgon, who regard\r\nit as an endeavour to balance a pyramid upon its apex. But apart from\r\nthe contradictory views of such textuaries, there can be no doubt that\r\nthe Vatican Codex has been of the greatest service in these later days\r\nin correcting the Authorised Version, and helping to restore the\r\nsacred text as nearly as possible to the purity of the original\r\nautographs. And it has added its most valuable testimony to that of\r\nthe many other ancient manuscripts of the Sacred Writings in\r\nexistence, that, notwithstanding unimportant variations of readings\r\nnaturally caused by the great multiplication of copies, the sacred\r\ntext from the time when it first appeared to the present has been\r\npreserved substantially uncorrupt; so that we have the same divine\r\ntruth presented to us that was presented to the Christians of the\r\nages immediately succeeding the time of the apostles.\r\n\r\nWith all these remarkable associations and points of interest\r\nconnected with the Vatican manuscript, it is not to be wondered at\r\nthat I should gaze upon it with a species of veneration. It\r\ntransported me in imagination to a period when the canon of the New\r\nTestament was as yet in a state of flux. The evidence of the\r\nMuratorian fragment in the Ambrosian Library at Milan shows to us that\r\nthe separate books of the New Testament had indeed been collected into\r\none; and a belief in their Divine inspiration equally with the Old\r\nTestament Scriptures had begun to be entertained. But there was as yet\r\nno prevailing unanimity of opinion as to what books should be admitted\r\ninto the Canon and what books should be excluded. No formal attempt\r\nhad as yet been made to reconcile conflicting testimonies; or, if\r\nmade, the recensions undertaken did not meet with general acceptance.\r\nEven a good many years afterwards, as late as at the Council of\r\nLaodicea in 361, doubts were still expressed as to the claims of the\r\nApocalypse to canonicity. This book was not originally included in the\r\nVatican Codex; for the manuscript copy of it bound up in the volume is\r\nof much later date, and in a different handwriting. And this\r\nhesitation regarding the full recognition of certain books, proves the\r\ngreat care that was exercised, and the deep sense of responsibility\r\nthat was felt, in the collection of the other books. The formation of\r\nthe sacred Canon was done gradually and imperceptibly; but the result\r\nto every thoughtful mind is more suggestive of the inspiration of that\r\nSpirit whose operation is like the wind that bloweth where it listeth,\r\nand thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it\r\ncometh and whither it goeth--than if the process had been more formal\r\nand conspicuous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nST. PAUL AT PUTEOLI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Gospel first came to Europe in circumstances similar to those in\r\nwhich it came into human history. Through poverty, shame, and\r\nsuffering--through the manger, the cross, and the sepulchre--did our\r\nSaviour accomplish the salvation of the world; through stripes and\r\nimprisonment, through the gloom of the inner dungeon and the pain and\r\nshame of the stocks, did Paul and Silas declare at Philippi the glad\r\ntidings of salvation. Out of the midnight darkness which enveloped the\r\napostles of the Cross, as they sang in the prison, came the marvellous\r\nlight that was destined to illumine all Europe. Out of the stocks\r\nwhich held fast the feet that came to the shores of the West shod with\r\nthe preparation of the gospel of peace, to proclaim deliverance to the\r\ncaptives, sprang that glorious liberty which has broken every fetter\r\nthat bound the bodies and souls of men throughout Christendom. After\r\nthe earthquake that shook the prison walls and released the prisoners\r\ncame the still, small voice of power, which overthrew the tyrannies\r\nand superstitions of ages, and remade society from its very\r\nfoundations.\r\n\r\nVery similar were the circumstances in which the apostle landed at the\r\nquay of Puteoli. A weary, worn-out prisoner, accused by his own\r\ncountrymen, on his way to be judged at the tribunal of the Roman\r\nemperor, associated with a troop of malefactors, St. Paul\r\ndisembarked, on the 3d of May of the year 59, from the ship _Castor\r\nand Pollux_, after having gone through storm and shipwreck, and first\r\ntouched the shore of the wonderful land destined afterwards to be the\r\nscene of the mightiest triumphs of the Gospel, and the most\r\nenlightened centre for its diffusion throughout the world. Like the\r\nbirth of Rome itself, whose obscure foundation, according to the\r\nbeautiful myth, was laid by the outcast son of a Vestal Virgin, the\r\nkingdom of the despised virgin-born Jesus of Nazareth that cometh not\r\nwith observation, stole unawares, amid the meanest circumstances, into\r\nthe very heart of the Roman world. Momentous events were taking place\r\nat the time throughout the Roman Empire, attracting all eyes, and\r\nengaging the attention of all minds; but the unnoticed landing at\r\nPuteoli of the humble Jewish prisoner, judging by its marvellous\r\nresults, was by far the most important. It marked a new era in the\r\nhistory of the world. And there was something significant in the\r\ncoincidence that St. Paul should have come to the Italian shore in the\r\nship _Castor and Pollux_, the names not merely of the patrons of\r\nsailors, but also of the saviours of Rome. The mighty empire which\r\nhuman tyranny had established has crumbled to pieces, and we walk\r\nto-day amid its ruins; but the kingdom of peace and righteousness\r\nwhich Paul came to inaugurate has spread from that coign of vantage\r\nover all the earth, and in a world of death and change has impressed\r\nupon the minds of men with a new force the idea of the eternal and the\r\nunchangeable.\r\n\r\nEarth holds no fairer scene than that which met the apostle's gaze as\r\nhe entered the bay of Puteoli. \"See Naples, and die,\" is the cuckoo\r\ncry of the modern tourist who visits this enchanted region; and such a\r\nvision is indeed worthy to be the last imprinted upon a human retina.\r\nIt is called by the Italians themselves \"Un pezzo di cielo caduto in\r\nterra,\" a piece of heaven fallen upon earth. Shores that curve in\r\nevery line of beauty, holding out arm-like promontories, into whose\r\nembrace the tideless sea runs up; mountain-ranges whose tops in\r\nwinter are covered with snow, and whose sides are draped with the\r\nluxuriant vegetation of the South; a large city rising in a series of\r\nsemicircular terraces from the deep azure of the sea to the deep azure\r\nof the mountains, whose eastern architecture flushes to a vivid rosy\r\nhue in the afternoon light like some fabled city of the poets; and\r\ndominating the glorious horizon the double peak of Vesuvius forming\r\nthe centre in which all the features of landscape loveliness are\r\nfocussed--crowned by its pillar of cloud by day and of fire by night.\r\nSuch is the picture upon which travellers crowd from the ends of the\r\nearth to gaze.\r\n\r\nNor was the view different in its most important elements in the days\r\nof the apostle. The same great forms of the landscape met the eye; and\r\nthe same magic play of light and colour, the same jewel-points\r\nflashing in the waters, the same gleams of purple and crimson\r\nwandering over town, and vineyard, and wood, transfigured the scene\r\nthen, which gives it more than half its loveliness now. But its human\r\nelements were different. Swarming with life as are these shores at the\r\npresent day, they were even more populous then. Where we now wander\r\nthrough picturesque ruins and silent solitudes, prosperous towns and\r\nvillages stood; and temples, palaces, and summer houses of patrician\r\nmagnificence crowded upon each other to such an extent that the sea\r\nitself was invaded, and an older Venice rose from the waters along the\r\ncurves of its bays. The shores of Baiæ were the very centre of Roman\r\nsplendour. The emperor and his court spent a large part of the year\r\nthere; and noble families, that elsewhere had domains miles in extent,\r\nwere there satisfied with the smallest space upon which they could\r\nbuild a house and plant a garden. Pompeii and Herculaneum, in all\r\ntheir reckless gaiety, lay, unconscious of danger, at the foot of\r\nVesuvius, then a grassy mountain wooded to the summit with oak and\r\nchestnut, and known from time immemorial as a field of pasture for\r\nflocks and herds. The Bay of Misenum, now so solitary that the scream\r\nof the sea-fowl is almost the only sound that breaks the stillness,\r\nwas crowded with the vessels of the Roman fleet, commanded by Pliny;\r\nand its waters were alive with the pleasure-boats of the patrician\r\nyouths, filling the air with the music of their laughter and song.\r\nPuteoli, or, as it is now called, Pozzuoli, a dull and stagnant\r\nfourth-rate town, was then the Liverpool of Italy, carrying on an\r\nimmense trade in corn between Egypt and the western provinces of the\r\nRoman Empire. It rivalled Delos in magnificence, and was called the\r\nLittle Rome. It had a splendid forum and harbour, and was guarded by\r\nfortifications which resisted the repeated attacks of Hannibal. In\r\nthis region almost every famous Roman of the later days of the\r\nRepublic and the earlier days of the Empire had his sea-side villa to\r\nwhich he retired from the noise and bustle of the Imperial City. It\r\nwas the Brighton or more properly the Bath of Rome; for though it was\r\nfrequented during the burning heats of summer for the sake of its\r\ncomparative coolness, it was principally chosen as a winter retreat to\r\nescape from the frosts and snows of the north. Lucullus carried here\r\nthe gorgeous luxury and extravagance of his city life; here Augustus\r\nand Hadrian had their palaces erected on vast piers thrown out into\r\nthe sea, whose waters still murmur over their remains; while Cicero\r\nbuilt here his _Puteolanum_, delightfully situated on the coast, and\r\nsurrounded by a shady grove, which he called his Academy, in imitation\r\nof Plato, and where he composed his \"Academia\" and \"De Fato.\" Hardly\r\nan inch of the soil but is full of fragments of mosaic pavements. The\r\ncommon stones of the road are often rich marbles, that formed part of\r\nimperial structures; and the very dust on which you tread, if\r\nanalysed, would be found to be a powder of gems and precious stones.\r\n\r\nBut alas! in some of the fairest spots of earth man has been vilest;\r\nand like the ancient Cities of the Plain, which stood in a region of\r\nEdenic loveliness, the shores of the Bay of Naples were inhabited by\r\na race corrupted with the worst vices of Roman civilisation. Some of\r\nthe most dreadful crimes that have disgraced humanity were committed\r\non that radiant shore. Yonder sleeps in the azure distance the\r\nenchanted isle of Capri, haunted for ever by dreadful memories of the\r\nunnameable atrocities with which the Emperor Tiberius had stained its\r\npeaceful bowers. On the neighbouring heights of Posilipo are traces of\r\nthe villa of Vedius, and of the celebrated fish-ponds where he fed his\r\n_murenæ_ with the flesh of his disobedient slaves. On the shore of\r\nPuteoli the apostle might have seen the remains of one of the maddest\r\nfreaks of imperial folly--the floating-bridge of Caligula, stretching\r\nacross the bay for nearly three miles, and decorated with the finest\r\nmosaic pavements and sculpture. Over this useless bridge the insane\r\nemperor drove in the chariot and armour of Alexander the Great, to\r\ncelebrate his triumph over the Parthians; and from it, on his return,\r\nhe ordered the crowd of inoffensive spectators to be hurled into the\r\nsea. By withdrawing for the construction of this bridge the ships\r\nemployed in the harbour, the importation of corn was put a stop to,\r\nand a grievous famine, felt even in Rome, was the result. And near at\r\nhand was Bauli, where Nero--the very Cæsar to whom it is startling to\r\nremember that St. Paul appealed, and before whom he was going to be\r\njudged,--only two years before attempted the murder of his own mother,\r\nAgrippina, which failed because of her discovery of the plot, but\r\nwhich was most ruthlessly accomplished very soon afterwards. Here too\r\nMarcellus was poisoned by Livia, that Tiberius might ascend the throne\r\nof Augustus; and Domitian by Nero, that he might enjoy the wealth of\r\nhis aunt. Here Hadrian, a few days before his own miserable end,\r\ncompelled his beautiful and accomplished wife, Sabina, to put herself\r\nto death, that she might not survive him in such a wretched world. And\r\nin the cities at the foot of Vesuvius have been revealed to us, after\r\nnature had kindly hidden them for eighteen centuries, tokens of a\r\ndepravity so utter, that we cannot help looking upon the fiery deluge\r\nfrom the mountain, that soon after St. Paul's visit swept them out of\r\nexistence, as a Divine judgment like that of Sodom and Gomorrha. And\r\ndarker even than these monstrosities of wickedness was the divine\r\nworship paid on these shores to the Roman emperors. It was a pitiable\r\nspectacle when the sailors of an Alexandrian ship, coming into the\r\nharbour of Puteoli, gave thanks for their prosperous voyage to the\r\ndying Augustus, whom they met cruising on the waters vainly in search\r\nof health, and offered him divine honours, which the gratified emperor\r\naccepted, and rewarded with gifts. But what shall we think of the\r\nworship of the god Caligula and the god Nero? Surely a people who\r\ncould raise altars and offer sacrifices to such unmitigated monsters\r\nmust have lost the very conception of religion. Not only virtue, but\r\nthe very belief in any source of virtue, must have been utterly\r\nextirpated in them. When Herod spoke, the people said it was the voice\r\nof God; and he was smitten with worms because he gave not God the\r\nglory. And surely the superhuman wickedness of the Cæsars may be\r\nregarded as a punishment, equally significant, of the fearful\r\nblasphemy of the worshipped and the worshippers.\r\n\r\nNo wonder that the shores of Baiæ now present a picture of the saddest\r\ndesolation. Where man sins, there man suffers. The relation between\r\nhuman crime and the barren wilderness is still as inflexibly\r\nmaintained as at the first. Until all recollection of the iniquities\r\nof the place has passed away it is fitting that these silent shores\r\nshould remain the desert that they are. We should not wish the old\r\nvoluptuous magnificence revived; and these myrtle bowers can never\r\nmore regain the charm of virgin solitudes untainted by man. Italy,\r\nlike Palestine, has thus an accursed spot in its fairest region--a\r\nvisible monument to all ages, of the great truth that the tidal wave\r\nof retribution will inevitably overwhelm every nation that forgets the\r\neternal distinctions of right and wrong.\r\n\r\nSt. Paul was a man of keen sensibilities and strong imagination. He\r\nmust therefore at Puteoli have been deeply impressed at once with the\r\nloveliness of nature and the wickedness of man. The contrast would\r\npresent itself to him in a very painful manner. As at Athens--where\r\nhis spirit was moved within him when he saw the city wholly given up\r\nto idolatry--so here he must have had that noble indignation against\r\nthe iniquities of the place--the outrages committed on the laws of\r\nGod, and the dishonour done to the nature of man made in the Divine\r\nimage--to which David and Jeremiah, and all the loftiest spirits of\r\nmankind, have given such stern and yet patriotic utterance. What\r\nothers were callous to, filled him with keen shame and sorrow. He who\r\ncould have wished that himself were accursed from Christ for his\r\nbrethren, his kinsmen according to the flesh, must have had a profound\r\npity for these wretched victims of profligacy, who were looking in\r\ntheir ignorance for salvation to a brutal mortal worse than\r\nthemselves,--\"the son of perdition, sitting in the temple of God,\r\nshowing that he was God.\" And to this feeling of indignation and\r\nsorrow, because of the wickedness of the place, must have been added a\r\nfeeling of personal despondency. From the significant circumstance\r\nthat the apostle thanked God, and took courage, when he met the\r\nChristian brethren at Apii Forum, we may infer that he had previously\r\ngreat heaviness of spirit. He would be more or less than human, if on\r\nsetting his foot for the first time on the native soil of the\r\nconquerors of his country, and the lords of the whole world, and\r\nseeing on every side, even at this distance from the imperial city,\r\noverwhelming evidences of the luxury and power of the empire, he did\r\nnot feel oppressed with a sense of personal insignificance. Evil had\r\nthroned itself there on the high places of the earth, and could mock\r\nat the puny efforts of the followers of Jesus to cast it down.\r\nIdolatry had so deeply rooted itself in the interests and passions of\r\nmen which were bound up in its continuance, that it seemed a foolish\r\ndream to expect that it would be supplanted by the preaching of the\r\nCross, which to St. Paul's own people was a stumbling-block and to all\r\nother nations foolishness. And who was he that he should undertake\r\nsuch a mission--a weak and obscure member of a despised race, a\r\nprisoner chained to a soldier, appealing to Cæsar against the\r\ncondemnation of his own countrymen. We can well believe, that\r\nnotwithstanding the sustaining grace that was given to him, the heart\r\nof the apostle must have been very heavy when he stood in the midst of\r\nthe jostling crowd on the quay of Puteoli, and took the first step\r\nthere on Italian soil of his journey to Rome. He felt most keenly all\r\nthat a man can feel of the shame and offence of the Cross; but\r\nnevertheless he was not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ. And his\r\npresence there on that Roman quay--a despised prisoner in bonds for\r\nthe sake of the Gospel--is a picture, that appeals to every heart, of\r\nthe triumph of Divine strength in the midst of human weakness; and a\r\nmost striking proof, moreover, that not by might, but by the Spirit of\r\nlove, does God bring down the strongholds of sin.\r\n\r\nBut God furnished a providential cure for whatever despondency the\r\napostle may have felt. No sooner did he land than he found himself\r\nsurrounded by Christian brethren, who cordially welcomed him, and\r\npersuaded him to remain with them seven days. Such brotherly kindness\r\nmust have greatly cheered him; and the week spent among these loyal\r\nfollowers of the Lord Jesus must have been a time of bodily and\r\nspiritual refreshment opportunely fitting him for the trying\r\nexperiences before him. Doubtless these brethren were Jewish converts\r\nto the Christian faith; for that there were Jewish residents at\r\nPuteoli, residing in the Tyrian quarter of the city, we are assured by\r\nJosephus; and this we should have expected from the mercantile\r\nimportance of the place and its intimate commercial relations with the\r\nEast. How they came under the influence of the Gospel we know not;\r\nthey may have been among \"the strangers of Rome\" who came to Jerusalem\r\nat Pentecost to keep the national feasts in obedience to the Mosaic\r\nLaw, and who were then brought to the knowledge of the truth by the\r\npreaching of St. Peter; or perhaps they were converts of St Paul's own\r\nmaking, in some of the numerous places which he visited on his\r\nmissionary tours, and who afterwards came to reside for business\r\npurposes at this port. We see in the presence of the Jewish brethren\r\nat Puteoli one of the most striking illustrations of the providential\r\npre-arrangements made for the diffusion of the Gospel throughout all\r\nnations. The Jews had a more than ordinary attachment to their native\r\nland. Patriotism in their case was not only a passion, but a part of\r\ntheir religion; and their love of country was entwined with the\r\nholiest feelings of their nature. In Jerusalem alone could God be\r\nacceptably worshipped. And yet it was divinely ordered that those who\r\nhad been for ages the hermits of the human race should become all at\r\nonce the most cosmopolitan, when the time for imparting to the world\r\nthe benefits of their isolated religious training had come. And the\r\nJews thus scattered abroad preserved amid their alien circumstances\r\ntheir national worship and customs, and thus became the natural links\r\nof connection between the missionaries of the Cross and the Gentiles\r\nwhom they wished to reach. Through such Jewish channels the Gospel\r\nspeedily penetrated into remote localities, which otherwise it would\r\nhave taken a long time to reach. We are struck with distinct traces of\r\nthe Christian faith in the time of St. Paul in the most unexpected\r\nplaces. For instance, in the National Museum at Naples I have seen\r\nrings with Christian emblems engraved upon them, which were found at\r\nPompeii; proving beyond doubt that there had been followers of Jesus\r\neven in that dissolute place, who, unlike Lot and his household, were\r\noverwhelmed in the same destruction with those whose evil deeds must\r\nhave daily vexed their righteous souls. The same symbols which we find\r\nin the Roman Catacombs,--the palm branch, the sacred fish the monogram\r\nof Jesus, the dove, are unmistakably represented on these rings. Some\r\nof them are double, indicating that they were used by married persons:\r\none has the palm branch twice repeated; another exhibits the palm and\r\nanchor; a third has a dove with a twig in its bill; and one ring has\r\nthe Greek word _elpis_--hope--inscribed upon it.\r\n\r\nSt. Paul at Puteoli may be said to have dwelt among his own people.\r\nNot only was he with his own countrymen and fellow-disciples, but he\r\nwas in the midst of associations that forcibly recalled his home. The\r\napostle was a citizen of a Greek city, and the language in which he\r\nspoke was Greek; and here, in the Bay of Naples, he was in the midst\r\nof a Greek colony, where Roman influence had not been able to efface\r\nthe deep impression which Greece had made upon the place. The original\r\nname of the splendid expanse of water before him was the Bay of Cumæ;\r\nand Cumæ was absolutely the first Greek settlement in the western\r\nseas. Neapolis or Parthenope was the beautiful Greek name of the city\r\nof Naples, testifying to its Hellenic origin; and Dicæarchia was the\r\nolder Greek name of Puteoli, a name used to a late period in\r\npreference to its Latin name, derived from the numerous mineral\r\nsprings in the neighbourhood. The whole lower part of Italy was wholly\r\nGreek; its arts, its customs, its literature, were all Hellenic; and\r\nits people belonged to the pure Ionic race whose keen imaginations and\r\nvivid sensuousness seemed to have been created out of the fervid hues\r\nand the pellucid air of their native land. Everywhere the subtle Greek\r\ntongue might be heard; and all, so far as Greek influence was\r\nconcerned, was as unchanged in the days of the apostle as when\r\nPythagoras visited the region, and adopted the inhabitants as the\r\nfittest agents in his great scheme of universal regeneration. St. Paul\r\ntherefore, at Puteoli, might have imagined himself standing on the\r\nvery soil of classic Hellas, and felt as much at home as in his own\r\nnative city of Tarsus. This wide diffusion of the Greek language\r\nthroughout the West as well as the East at this time is another of\r\nthe remarkable providential pre-arrangements which prepared the way\r\nfor the preaching of the Gospel throughout the world. A Gentile\r\nspeech, by a series of wonderful events, was thus made ready over all\r\nthe world to receive and to communicate the glorious Gospel that was\r\nto be preached to all nations.\r\n\r\nThe remains of the ancient pier upon which St. Paul landed may still\r\nbe seen. Indeed, no Roman harbour has left behind such solid\r\nmemorials. No less than thirteen of the buttresses that supported its\r\narches are left, three lying under water; all constructed of brick\r\nheld together by that Roman cement called pozzolana, after the town of\r\nPozzuoli, whose extraordinary tenacity rivals that of the living rock.\r\nYou can plant your feet upon the very stones upon which the apostle\r\nmust have stood. And if you happen to be there on the 3d of May you\r\nwill see a solemn procession of the inhabitants of the decayed town,\r\nheaded by their priests, celebrating the anniversary of this memorable\r\nincident. The first conspicuous object upon which the eye of the\r\napostle would rest on landing would be the Temple of Neptune, of which\r\na few pillars are still standing in the midst of the water. Here\r\nCaligula, in his mad passage over his bridge of boats, paused to offer\r\npropitiatory sacrifices. Here, too, Cæsar, before he sailed to Greece\r\nto encounter the forces of Antony at Actium, sacrificed to Neptune;\r\nand here the crew of every ship presented offerings, in order to\r\nsecure favouring winds and waves when outward bound, or in gratitude\r\nwhen returning home from a successful voyage. Beyond this he would see\r\nin all its splendour the famous bathing establishment built over a\r\nthermal spring near the sea, which has since been known as the Temple\r\nof Serapis, an Egyptian deity, whose worship had spread widely in\r\nItaly. Three tall columns of cipollino marble, belonging to the\r\nportico of this building, are still standing, with their bases under\r\nwater; and they have acquired a world-wide interest, especially to\r\ngeologists, as records of the successive elevations and depressions\r\nof the coast-line during the historical period; these changes being\r\nindicated on their shafts by the different watermarks and the\r\nperforations of marine bivalves or boring-shells well known to be\r\nliving in the Mediterranean Sea. In the upper part of the town, on a\r\ncommanding height, he would behold the Temple of Augustus, built for\r\nthe worship of the deified founder of the Roman Empire. A Christian\r\ncathedral dedicated to St. Proculus, who suffered martyrdom in the\r\nsame year with St. Januarius, containing the tomb of Pergolesi, the\r\ncelebrated musical composer, now occupies the site of the pagan\r\nshrine, and has six of its Corinthian pillars, that looked down upon\r\nthe apostle as he landed, built into its walls. A temple of Diana and\r\na temple of the Nymphs also adorned the town, from which numerous\r\ncolumns and sculptures have been recently recovered. On every side the\r\napostle would see mournful tokens that the city was wholly given up to\r\nidolatry,--to the worship of mortal men and an ignoble crowd of gods\r\nand goddesses borrowed from all nations; and yet he had equally sad\r\nproofs that the idolatry was altogether a hollow and heartless\r\npretence,--that the superstitious creed publicly maintained by the\r\ncity had long ceased to command the respect of its recognised\r\ndefenders.\r\n\r\nI walked up from the town along the remains of the Via Campana, a\r\ncross-road that led from Puteoli to Capua and there joined the famous\r\nAppian Way. Along this road the apostle passed on his way to Rome; and\r\nit is still paved with the original lava-blocks upon which his feet\r\nhad pressed. One of the principal objects on the way is the\r\namphitheatre of Nero, with its tiers of seats, its arena, and its\r\nsubterranean passages, in a wonderful state of preservation, richly\r\nplumed with the delicate fronds of the maiden-hair fern, which drapes\r\nwith its living loveliness so many of the ruins of Greece and Italy.\r\nIt was here that Nero himself rehearsed the parts in which he wished\r\nto act on the more public stage of Rome. The sands of the arena were\r\ndyed with the blood of St. Januarius, who was thrown to the wild\r\nbeasts by order of Diocletian, and whose blood is annually liquefied\r\nby a supposititious miracle in Naples at the present day. Behind the\r\namphitheatre the apostle would get a glimpse of the famous Phlegræan\r\nFields so often referred to in the classic poets as the scene of the\r\nwars of the gods and the giants.\r\n\r\nThis is the Holy Land of Paganism. All the scenery of the eleventh\r\nbook of the _Odyssey_ and of the sixth book of the _Æneid_ spreads\r\nbeneath the eye. At every step you come upon some spot associated with\r\nthe romantic literature of antiquity. From thence the imaginative\r\nshapes of Greek mythology passed into the poetry of Rome. There\r\neverything takes us back far beyond the birth of Roman civilisation,\r\nand reminds us of the legends of the older Hellenic days, which will\r\nexercise an undying spell on the higher minds of the human race down\r\nto the latest ages. It is the land of Virgil, whose own tomb is not\r\nfar off; and under the guidance of his genius we visit the ghostly\r\nCimmerian shores, now bathed in glowing sunshine, and stand on spots\r\nthat thrilled the hearts of Hercules and Ulysses with awe. There the\r\nterrible Avernus, to which the descent was so easy, sleeps in its deep\r\nbasin, long ago divested by the axe of Agrippa of the impenetrable\r\ngloom and mysterious dread which its dark forests had created; its\r\nsteep banks partly covered with natural copsewood bright with a living\r\nmosaic of cyclamens and lilies, and partly formed of cultivated\r\nfields. During my visit the delicious odour of the bean blossom\r\npervaded the fields, reminding me vividly of familiar rural scenes far\r\naway. Yonder is the subterranean passage called by the common people\r\nthe Sibyl's Cave, where Æneas came and plucked the golden bough, and,\r\nled by the melancholy priestess of Apollo, went down to the dreary\r\nworld of the dead. It was the general tradition of Pagan nations that\r\nthe point of departure from this world, as well as the entrance to the\r\nnext, was always in the west. We find the largest number of the\r\nprehistoric relics of the dead on the western shores of our own\r\ncountry. The cave of Loch Dearg--at first connected with primitive\r\npagan rites and subsequently the traditional entrance to the Purgatory\r\nof St. Patrick--is situated in the west of Ireland, and corresponds to\r\nthe cave of the Sibyl and the Lake of Avernus in Italy. Indeed the\r\nword Avernus itself bears such a close resemblance to the Gaelic word\r\nIfrinn--the name of the infernal regions, and to the name of Loch\r\nHourn, the Lake of Hell, on the north-west coast of Scotland--that it\r\nhas given rise to the supposition that it was the legacy of a\r\nprehistoric Celtic people who at one time inhabited the Phlegræan\r\nFields. On the other side of Lake Avernus is the Mare Morto, the Lake\r\nor Sea of the Dead, with its memories of Charon and his ghostly crew,\r\nwhich now shines in the setting sun like a field of gold sparkling\r\nwith jewels; and beyond it are the Elysian Fields, the abodes of the\r\nblessed, the rich life of whose soil breaks out at every pore into a\r\nluxuriant maze of vines and orange trees, and all manner of lovely and\r\nfruitful vegetation. Still farther behind is the Acherusian Marsh of\r\nthe poets, now called the Lake of Fusaro, because hemp and flax are\r\nput to steep in it; and the river Styx itself, by which the gods dare\r\nnot swear in vain, reduced to an insignificant rill flowing into the\r\nsea. It is most interesting to think of the apostle Paul being\r\nassociated with this enchanted region. His presence on the scene is\r\nnecessary to complete its charm, and to remind us that the vain dreams\r\nof those blind old seekers after God were all fulfilled in Him who\r\nopened a door for us in heaven, and brought life and immortality to\r\nlight in the Gospel.\r\n\r\nSt. Paul must have noticed--though Scripture, intent only upon the\r\nunfolding of the religious drama, makes no reference to it--the crater\r\nof Solfatara, one of the most wonderful phenomena of this wonderful\r\nregion, for it lay directly in his path, and was only about a mile\r\ndistant from Puteoli. This was the famous Forum of Vulcan, where the\r\ngod fashioned his terrible tools, and shook the earth with the fierce\r\nfires of his forge. On account of its gaseous fumaroles, and the\r\nflames thrown out with a loud roaring noise from one gloomy cavern in\r\nits side, this volcano may still be considered active. Its white\r\ncalcined crater is clothed in some places with green shrubs,\r\nparticularly with luxuriant sage, myrtle, and white heather; but an\r\neruption took place in it so late as 1198, during which a lava\r\ncurrent, a rare phenomenon in this district, flowed from its southern\r\nedge to the sea, destroying the ancient cemetery on the Via Puteolana,\r\nand forming the present promontory of Olibano. The ground sounds\r\nhollow beneath a heavy tread, reminding one unpleasantly that but a\r\nthin crust covers the fiery abyss which might break through at any\r\nmoment. With the exception of Vesuvius, this is the only surviving\r\nremnant of the fierce elemental forces which have devastated this\r\ncoast in every direction. The whole region is one mass of craters of\r\nvarious sizes and ages, some far older than Vesuvius, and others of\r\ncomparatively recent origin. They are all craters of eruption and not\r\nof elevation; and in their formation they have interfered with and in\r\nsome cases almost obliterated pre-existing ones. Some of them are\r\nfilled with lakes, and others clothed with luxuriant vineyards, and\r\nwild woods fit for the chase, or encircling cultivated fields. To one\r\nlooking upon it from a commanding position such as the heights of\r\nPosilipo, the landscape presents a universally blistered appearance.\r\nHot mineral springs everywhere abound, often associated with the ruins\r\nof old Roman baths; and the soil is a white felspathic ash, disposed\r\nin layers of such fineness and regularity that they look as if they\r\nhad been stratified under water, the sea and the shore having\r\nalternately given place to each other. Of the white earth abounding on\r\nevery side, which has given to the place the old name of Campi\r\nLeucogæi, and is the result of the metamorphosis of the trachytic tufa\r\nby the chemical action of the gases that rise up through the\r\nfumaroles, a very fine variety of porcelain--known to collectors as\r\nCapo di Monti--used to be made on the hill behind Naples, and it has\r\nbeen supposed that the china clays of Cornwall and other places have\r\nbeen produced from the felspars of the granites in a similar way. The\r\nwhole of the Solfatara crater has been enclosed for the purpose of\r\nmanufacturing alum from its soil. On the hillside to the north there\r\nare several caverns, called _stufe_, from whence gas and hot steam\r\narise, and these are used by the inhabitants as admirable vapour\r\nbaths. So late as the year 1538 a terrible volcanic explosion,\r\naccompanied with violent earthquakes, happened not far from Puteoli,\r\nwhich threw up from the flat plain on which the village of Tripergola\r\nstood, a mountain called Monte Nuovo, four hundred and forty feet high\r\nand a mile and a half in circumference, consisting entirely of ashes\r\nand cinders, obliterating a large part of the celebrated Leucrine\r\nLake, elevating the site of the temple of Serapis sixteen feet, and\r\nthen depressing it, and generally changing the old features of this\r\nlocality. This eruption gave relief to the throes of Lake Avernus,\r\nwhich henceforth ceased to send forth its exhalations, and became the\r\ncheerful garden scene which we now behold.\r\n\r\nHere on a small scale, in the very neighbourhood of man's busiest\r\nhaunts, occur the cosmical cataclysms which are usually seen only in\r\nremote solitudes, and which during the unknown ages of geology have\r\nleft their indelible records on large portions of the earth's surface.\r\nHere we are admitted into the very workshop of Nature, and are\r\nprivileged to witness her processes of creation. In the neighbourhood\r\nof Rome the volcanoes are long extinct. Nature is dead, and there is\r\nnothing left but her cold gray ashes. But here we see her in all her\r\nvigour, changing and renewing and mingling the ruins of her works in\r\nstrange association with those of man--the ashes of her volcanoes with\r\nthe fragments of temples and baths and the houses of Roman senators\r\nand poets. The whole region lies over a burning mystery, and one has\r\na constant feeling of insecurity lest the ground should open suddenly\r\nand precipitate one into the very heart of it. Naples itself, strange\r\nto say, a city of more than five hundred thousand inhabitants, is\r\nbuilt in great part within an old broken-down volcanic crater, and the\r\nproximity of its awful neighbour shows that it stands perilously on\r\nthe brink of destruction, and may share at any time the fate of\r\nPompeii and Herculaneum. Were it not for the safety-valves of Vesuvius\r\nand Solfatara, the whole intermediate region, with its towns and\r\nvillages and swarming population, would be blown into the air by the\r\nvehement forces that are struggling beneath. It was this elemental\r\nwar--fiercer, we have reason to believe, in classic times than\r\nnow--that gave rise to the religious fables of the poets. The gloomy\r\nshades of Avernus, the tremendous battles of the gods, the dark\r\npictures of Tartarus and the Stygian river, were the supernatural\r\nsuggestions of a fiery soil. To the fierce throes of volcanic action\r\nwe owe the weird mythology of the ancients, which has imparted such a\r\nprofound charm to the region, and also, strange as it may seem, the\r\nsurpassing loveliness of Nature herself. The fairest regions of the\r\nearth are ever those where the awful power of fire has been at work,\r\ngiving to the landscape that passionate expression which lights up a\r\nhuman face with its most impressive beauty.\r\n\r\nThe visit of the apostle to Puteoli served many important purposes. He\r\nwho had sent his people Israel into Egypt and Babylon that they might\r\nbe benefited by coming into contact with other civilisations, sent St.\r\nPaul to this famous region where Greece and Rome--which,\r\ngeographically and historically, were turned back to back, the face of\r\nGreece looking eastward, the face of Italy looking westward--seemed to\r\nmeet and to blend into each other, in order that his sympathies might\r\nbe expanded by coming into contact with all that man could realise of\r\nearthly glory or conceive of religion. We can trace the overruling\r\nHand that was shaping the destinies of the Church in the course which\r\nhe was led to take from Jerusalem to Damascus, and thence to Asia\r\nMinor, Corinth, Athens, Philippi, Puteoli, and Rome; gathering as he\r\nwent along the fruits of all the wide diversity of experience and\r\nculture characterising these places, to equip him more thoroughly for\r\nhis work for the Gentiles. And we see also how the doctrines of the\r\nGospel were becoming more clearly and fully unfolded by this method of\r\nprogression; how questions were settled and principles carried out\r\nwhich have shown to us the exceeding riches of Divine grace in a way\r\nthat we could not otherwise have known. Like the lines and marks of\r\nthe chrysalis which appear on the body of the butterfly when it first\r\nspreads out its wings to fly--like the folds of the bud which may be\r\nseen in the newly-expanded leaf or flower--so Christianity at first\r\nemerged from its Jewish sheath with the distinctive marks of Judaism\r\nupon it. But as it passed westward from the Holy City, it slowly\r\nextricated itself out of the spirit and the trammels of Judaism into\r\nthe self-restraining freedom which Christ gives to His people. The\r\nteaching of the Gospel was fully developed, guarded from all possible\r\nmisinterpretation, and practically applied to all representative\r\ncircumstances of men, through its coming into contact with the events,\r\npersons, and scenes associated with the wonderful missionary\r\njourneyings of the apostle Paul, which began at Jerusalem and\r\nterminated at Rome. When the Gospel reached the Imperial City, its\r\nrelations to Jews and Gentiles, bond and free, were fixed for ever,\r\nits own form was perfected, and the conditions for its diffusion\r\nmatured; and its history henceforth, like that of Rome itself, was\r\nsynonymous with the history of the world.\r\n\r\n_Printed by_ R. & R.
