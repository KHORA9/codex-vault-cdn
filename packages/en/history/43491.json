C., January 7, 1914._\r\n\r\nSir: I have the honor to submit the accompanying manuscript of a memoir\r\nbearing the title \"An Introduction to the Study of the Maya Hieroglyphs,\"\r\nby Sylvanus Griswold Morley, and to recommend its publication as a bulletin\r\nof the Bureau of American Ethnology.\r\n\r\nThe hieroglyphic writing developed by the Maya of Central America and\r\nsouthern Mexico was probably the foremost intellectual achievement of\r\npre-Columbian times in the New World, and as such it deserves equal\r\nattention with other graphic systems of antiquity.\r\n\r\nThe earliest inscriptions now extant probably date from about the beginning\r\nof the Christian era, but such is the complexity of the glyphs and subject\r\nmatter even at this early period, that in order to estimate the age of the\r\nsystem it is necessary to postulate a far greater antiquity for its origin.\r\nIndeed all that can be accepted safely in this direction is that many\r\ncenturies must have elapsed before the Maya hieroglyphic writing could have\r\nbeen developed to the highly complex stage where we first encounter it.\r\n\r\nThe first student to make any progress in deciphering the Maya inscriptions\r\nwas Prof. Ernst Förstemann, of the Royal Library at Dresden. About 1880\r\nProfessor Förstemann published a facsimile reproduction of the Dresden\r\ncodex, and for the next twenty years devoted the greater part of his time\r\nto the elucidation of this manuscript. He it was who first discovered and\r\nworked out the ingenious vigesimal system of numeration used by the Maya,\r\nand who first pointed out how this system was utilized to record\r\nastronomical and chronological facts. In short, his pioneer work made\r\npossible all subsequent progress in deciphering Maya texts.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, about the same time, or a little later (in 1891), another\r\nstudent of the same subject, Mr. J. T. Goodman, of Alameda, California,\r\nworking independently and without knowledge of Professor Förstemann's\r\nresearches, also succeeded in deciphering the chronological parts of the\r\nMaya texts, and in determining the values of the head-variant numerals. Mr.\r\nGoodman also perfected some {iv} tables, \"The Archaic Chronological\r\nCalendar\" and \"The Archaic Annual Calendar,\" which greatly facilitate the\r\ndecipherment of the calculations recorded in the texts.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that very little progress has been made in deciphering\r\nthe Maya glyphs except those relating to the calendar and chronology; that\r\nis, the signs for the various time periods (days and months), the numerals,\r\nand a few name-glyphs; however, as these known signs comprise possibly\r\ntwo-fifths of all the glyphs, it is clear that the general tenor of the\r\nMaya inscriptions is no longer concealed from us. The remaining\r\nthree-fifths probably tell the nature of the events which occurred on the\r\ncorresponding dates, and it is to these we must turn for the subject matter\r\nof Maya history. The deciphering of this textual residuum is enormously\r\ncomplicated by the character of the Maya glyphs, which for the greater part\r\nare ideographic rather than phonetic; that is, the various symbols\r\nrepresent ideas rather than sounds.\r\n\r\nIn a graphic system composed largely of ideographic elements it is\r\nextremely difficult to determine the meanings of the different signs, since\r\nlittle or no help is to be derived from varying combinations of elements as\r\nin a phonetic system. In phonetic writing the symbols have fixed sounds,\r\nwhich are unchanging throughout, and when these values have once been\r\ndetermined, they may be substituted for the characters wherever they occur,\r\nand thus words are formed.\r\n\r\nWhile the Maya glyphs largely represent ideas, indubitable traces of\r\nphoneticism and phonetic composition appear. There are perhaps half a dozen\r\nglyphs in all which are known to be constructed on a purely phonetic basis,\r\nand as the remaining glyphs are gradually deciphered this number will\r\ndoubtless be increased.\r\n\r\nThe progress which has been made in deciphering the Maya inscriptions may\r\nbe summarized as follows: The Maya calendar, chronology, and astronomy as\r\nrecorded in the hieroglyphic texts have been carefully worked out, and it\r\nis unlikely that future discoveries will change our present conception of\r\nthem. There remains, however, a group of glyphs which are probably\r\nnon-calendric, non-chronologic, and non-astronomic in character. These, it\r\nmay be reasonably expected, will be found to describe the subject matter of\r\nMaya history; that is, they probably set forth the nature of the events\r\nwhich took place on the dates recorded. An analogy would be the following:\r\nSupposing, in scanning a history of the United States, only the dates could\r\nbe read. We would find, for example, July 4, 1776, followed by unknown\r\ncharacters; April 12, 1861, by others; and March 4, 1912, by others. This,\r\nthen, is the case with the Maya glyphs--we find dates followed by glyphs of\r\nunknown meaning, which presumably set forth the nature of the corresponding\r\nevents. In a word, we know now the {v} chronologic skeleton of Maya\r\nhistory; it remains to work out the more intimate details which alone can\r\nmake it a vital force.\r\n\r\nThe published writings on the subject of the Maya hieroglyphs have become\r\nso voluminous, and are so widely scattered and inaccessible, that it is\r\ndifficult for students of Central American archeology to become familiar\r\nwith what has been accomplished in this important field of investigation.\r\nIn the present memoir Mr. Morley, who has devoted a number of years to the\r\nstudy of Maya archeology, and especially to the hieroglyphs, summarizes the\r\nresults of these researches to the present time, and it is believed that\r\nthis _Introduction to the Study of the Maya Hieroglyphs_ will be the means\r\nof enabling ready and closer acquaintance with this interesting though\r\nintricate subject.\r\n\r\n      Very respectfully,\r\n\r\n                                                     F. W. HODGE,\r\n                                                   _Ethnologist-in-Charge._\r\n\r\n  Dr. CHARLES D. WALCOTT,\r\n      _Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution,_\r\n                                      _Washington, D. C._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n{vii}\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nWith the great expansion of interest in American archeology during the last\r\nfew years there has grown to be a corresponding need and demand for primary\r\ntextbooks, archeological primers so to speak, which will enable the general\r\nreader, without previous knowledge of the science, to understand its\r\nseveral branches. With this end in view, the author has prepared An\r\nIntroduction to the Study of the Maya Hieroglyphs.\r\n\r\nThe need for such a textbook in this particular field is suggested by two\r\nconsiderations: (1) The writings of previous investigators, having been\r\ndesigned to meet the needs of the specialist rather than those of the\r\nbeginner, are for the greater part too advanced and technical for general\r\ncomprehension; and (2) these writings are scattered through many\r\npublications, periodicals as well as books, some in foreign languages, and\r\nalmost all difficult of access to the average reader.\r\n\r\nTo the second of these considerations, however, the writings of Mr. C. P.\r\nBowditch, of Boston, Massachusetts, offer a conspicuous exception,\r\nparticularly his final contribution to this subject, entitled \"The\r\nNumeration, Calendar Systems, and Astronomical Knowledge of the Mayas,\" the\r\npublication of which in 1910 marked the dawn of a new era in the study of\r\nthe Maya hieroglyphic writing. In this work Mr. Bowditch exhaustively\r\nsummarizes all previous knowledge of the subject, and also indicates the\r\nmost promising lines for future investigation. The book is a vast\r\nstorehouse of heretofore scattered material, now gathered together for the\r\nfirst time and presented to the student in a readily accessible form.\r\nIndeed, so thorough is its treatment, the result of many years of intensive\r\nstudy, that the writer would have hesitated to bring out another work,\r\nnecessarily covering much of the same ground, had it not been for his\r\nbelief that Mr. Bowditch's book is too advanced for lay comprehension. The\r\nMaya hieroglyphic writing is exceedingly intricate; its subject matter is\r\ncomplex and its forms irregular; and in order to be understood it must be\r\npresented in a very elementary way. The writer believes that this primer\r\nmethod of treatment has not been followed in the publication in question\r\nand, furthermore, that the omission of specimen texts, which would give the\r\nstudent practice in deciphering the glyphs, renders it too technical for\r\nuse by the beginner. {viii}\r\n\r\nAcknowledgment should be made here to Mr. Bowditch for his courtesy in\r\npermitting the reproduction of a number of drawings from his book, the\r\nexamples of the period, day and month glyphs figured being derived almost\r\nentirely from this source; and in a larger sense for his share in the\r\nestablishment of instruction in this field of research at Harvard\r\nUniversity where the writer first took up these studies.\r\n\r\nIn the limited space available it would have been impossible to present a\r\ndetailed picture of the Maya civilization, nor indeed is this essential to\r\nthe purpose of the book. It has been thought advisable, however, to precede\r\nthe general discussion of the hieroglyphs with a brief review of the\r\nhabitat, history, customs, government, and religion of the ancient Maya, so\r\nthat the reader may gather a general idea of the remarkable people whose\r\nwriting and calendar he is about to study.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n{ix}\r\n\r\n                                CONTENTS\r\n\r\n                                                                       Page\r\n  CHAPTER I.

THE MAYA\r\n\r\nHABITAT\r\n\r\nBroadly speaking, the Maya were a lowland people, inhabiting the Atlantic\r\ncoast plains of southern Mexico and northern Central America. (See pl. 1.)\r\nThe southern part of this region is abundantly watered by a network of\r\nstreams, many of which have their rise in the Cordillera, while the\r\nnorthern part, comprising the peninsula of Yucatan, is entirely lacking in\r\nwater courses and, were it not for natural wells (_cenotes_) here and\r\nthere, would be uninhabitable. This condition in the north is due to the\r\ngeologic formation of the peninsula, a vast plain underlaid by limestone\r\nthrough which water quickly percolates to subterranean channels.\r\n\r\nIn the south the country is densely forested, though occasional savannas\r\nbreak the monotony of the tropical jungles. The rolling surface is\r\ntraversed in places by ranges of hills, the most important of which are the\r\nCockscomb Mountains of British Honduras; these attain an elevation of 3,700\r\nfeet. In Yucatan the nature of the soil and the water-supply not being\r\nfavorable to the growth of a luxuriant vegetation, this region is covered\r\nwith a smaller forest growth and a sparser bush than the area farther\r\nsouthward.\r\n\r\nThe climate of the region occupied by the Maya is tropical; there are two\r\nseasons, the rainy and the dry. The former lasts from May or June until\r\nJanuary or February, there being considerable local variation not only in\r\nthe length of this season but also in the time of its beginning.\r\n\r\nDeer, tapirs, peccaries, jaguars, and game of many other kinds abound\r\nthroughout the entire region, and doubtless formed a large part of the food\r\nsupply in ancient times, though formerly corn was the staple, as it is now.\r\n\r\nThere are at present upward of twenty tribes speaking various dialects of\r\nthe Maya language, perhaps half a million people in all. These live in the\r\nsame general region their ancestors occupied, but under greatly changed\r\nconditions. Formerly the Maya were the van of civilization in the New\r\nWorld,[1] but to-day they are a dwindling {2} race, their once remarkable\r\ncivilization is a thing of the past, and its manners and customs are\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\nHISTORY\r\n\r\nThe ancient Maya, with whom this volume deals, emerged from barbarism\r\nprobably during the first or second century of the Christian Era; at least\r\ntheir earliest dated monument can not be ascribed with safety to a more\r\nremote period.[2] How long a time had been required for the development of\r\ntheir complex calendar and hieroglyphic system to the point of graphic\r\nrecord, it is impossible to say, and any estimate can be only conjectural.\r\nIt is certain, however, that a long interval must have elapsed from the\r\nfirst crude and unrelated scratches of savagery to the elaborate and\r\ninvolved hieroglyphs found on the earliest monuments, which represent not\r\nonly the work of highly skilled sculptors, but also the thought of\r\nintensively developed minds. That this period was measured by centuries\r\nrather than by decades seems probable; the achievement was far too great to\r\nhave been performed in a single generation or even in five or ten.\r\n\r\nIt seems safe to assume, therefore, that by the end of the second century\r\nof the Christian Era the Maya civilization was fairly on its feet. There\r\nthen began an extraordinary development all along the line. City after city\r\nsprang into prominence throughout the southern part of the Maya\r\nterritory,[3] each contributing its share to the general progress and art\r\nof the time. With accomplishment came confidence and a quickening of pace.\r\nAll activities doubtless shared in the general uplift which followed,\r\nthough little more than the material evidences of architecture and\r\nsculpture have survived the ravages of the destructive environment in which\r\nthis culture flourished; and it is chiefly from these remnants of ancient\r\nMaya art that the record of progress has been partially reconstructed.\r\n\r\nThis period of development, which lasted upward of 400 years, or until\r\nabout the close of the sixth century, may be called {3} perhaps the \"Golden\r\nAge of the Maya\"; at least it was the first great epoch in their history,\r\nand so far as sculpture is concerned, the one best comparable to the\r\nclassic period of Greek art. While sculpture among the Maya never again\r\nreached so high a degree of perfection, architecture steadily developed,\r\nalmost to the last. Judging from the dates inscribed upon their monuments,\r\nall the great cities of the south flourished during this period: Palenque\r\nand Yaxchilan in what is now southern Mexico; Piedras Negras, Seibal,\r\nTikal, Naranjo, and Quirigua in the present Guatemala; and Copan in the\r\npresent Honduras. All these cities rose to greatness and sank again into\r\ninsignificance, if not indeed into oblivion, before the close of this\r\nGolden Age.\r\n\r\nThe causes which led to the decline of civilization in the south are\r\nunknown. It has been conjectured that the Maya were driven from their\r\nsouthern homes by stronger peoples pushing in from farther south and from\r\nthe west, or again, that the Maya civilization, having run its natural\r\ncourse, collapsed through sheer lack of inherent power to advance. Which,\r\nif either, of these hypotheses be true, matters little, since in any event\r\none all-important fact remains: Just after the close of Cycle 9 of Maya\r\nchronology, toward the end of the sixth century, there is a sudden and\r\nfinal cessation of dates in all the southern cities, apparently indicating\r\nthat they were abandoned about this time.\r\n\r\nStill another condition doubtless hastened the general decline if indeed it\r\ndid no more. There is strong documentary evidence[4] that about the middle\r\nor close of the fifth century the southern part of Yucatan was discovered\r\nand colonized. In the century following, the southern cities one by one\r\nsank into decay; at least none of their monuments bear later dates, and\r\ncoincidently Chichen Itza, the first great city of the north, was founded\r\nand rose to prominence. In the absence of reliable contemporaneous records\r\nit is impossible to establish the absolute accuracy of any theory relating\r\nto times so {4} remote as those here under consideration; but it seems not\r\nimprobable that after the discovery of Yucatan and the subsequent opening\r\nup of that vast region, the southern cities commenced to decline. As the\r\nnew country waxed the old waned, so that by the end of the sixth century\r\nthe rise of the one and the fall of the other had occurred.\r\n\r\nThe occupation and colonization of Yucatan marked the dawn of a new era for\r\nthe Maya although their Renaissance did not take place at once. Under\r\npressure of the new environment, at best a parched and waterless land, the\r\nMaya civilization doubtless underwent important modification.[5] The period\r\nof colonization, with the strenuous labor by which it was marked, was not\r\nconducive to progress in the arts. At first the struggle for bare existence\r\nmust have absorbed in a large measure the energies of all, and not until\r\ntheir foothold was secure could much time have been available for the\r\ncultivation of the gentler pursuits. Then, too, at first there seems to\r\nhave been a feeling of unrest in the new land, a shifting of homes and a\r\ntesting of localities, all of which retarded the development of\r\narchitecture, sculpture, and other arts. Bakhalal (see pl. 1), the first\r\nsettlement in the north, was occupied for only 60 years. Chichen Itza, the\r\nnext location, although occupied for more than a century, was finally\r\nabandoned and the search for a new home resumed. Moving westward from\r\nChichen Itza, Chakanputun was seized and occupied at the beginning of the\r\neighth century. Here the Maya are said to have lived for 260 years, until\r\nthe destruction of Chakanputun by fire about 960 A. D. again set them\r\nwandering. By this time, however, some four centuries had elapsed since the\r\nfirst colonization of the country, and they doubtless felt themselves fully\r\ncompetent to cope with any problems arising from their environment. Once\r\nmore their energies had begun to find outlet in artistic expression. The\r\nTransitional Period was at an end, and The Maya Renaissance, if the term\r\nmay be used, was fully under way.\r\n\r\nThe opening of the eleventh century witnessed important and far-reaching\r\npolitical changes in Yucatan. After the destruction of Chakanputun the\r\nhorizon of Maya activity expanded. Some of the fugitives from Chakanputun\r\nreoccupied Chichen Itza while others established themselves at a new site\r\ncalled Mayapan. About this time also the city of Uxmal seems to have been\r\nfounded. In the year 1000 these three cities--Chichen Itza, Uxmal, and\r\nMayapan--formed a confederacy,[6] in which each was to share equally in the\r\ngovernment of the country. Under the peaceful conditions which {5} followed\r\nthe formation of this confederacy for the next 200 years the arts blossomed\r\nforth anew.\r\n\r\nThis was the second and last great Maya epoch. It was their Age of\r\nArchitecture as the first period had been their Age of Sculpture. As a\r\nseparate art sculpture languished; but as an adjunct, an embellishment to\r\narchitecture, it lived again. The one had become handmaiden to the other.\r\nFaçades were treated with a sculptural decoration, which for intricacy and\r\nelaboration has rarely been equaled by any people at any time; and yet this\r\nresult was accomplished without sacrifice of beauty or dignity. During this\r\nperiod probably there arose the many cities which to-day are crumbling in\r\ndecay throughout the length and breadth of Yucatan, their very names\r\nforgotten. When these were in their prime, the country must have been one\r\ngreat beehive of activity, for only a large population could have left\r\nremains so extensive.\r\n\r\nThis era of universal peace was abruptly terminated about 1200 A. D. by an\r\nevent which shook the body politic to its foundations and disrupted the\r\nTriple Alliance under whose beneficent rule the land had grown so\r\nprosperous. The ruler of Chichen Itza, Chac Xib Chac, seems to have plotted\r\nagainst his colleague of Mayapan, one Hunnac Ceel, and in the disastrous\r\nwar which followed, the latter, with the aid of Nahua allies,[7] utterly\r\nrouted his opponent and drove him from his city. The conquest of Chichen\r\nItza seems to have been followed during the thirteenth century by attempted\r\nreprisals on the part of the vanquished Itza, which plunged the country\r\ninto civil war; and this struggle in turn paved the way for the final\r\neclipse of Maya supremacy in the fifteenth century.\r\n\r\nAfter the dissolution of the Triple Alliance a readjustment of power became\r\nnecessary. It was only natural that the victors in the late war should\r\nassume the chief direction of affairs, and there is strong evidence that\r\nMayapan became the most important city in the land. It is not improbable\r\nalso that as a result of this war Chichen Itza was turned over to Hunnac\r\nCeel's Nahua allies, perhaps in recognition of their timely assistance, or\r\nas their share in the spoils of war. It is certain that sometime during its\r\nhistory Chichen Itza came under a strong Nahua influence. One group of\r\nbuildings in particular[8] shows in its architecture and bas-reliefs that\r\nit was undoubtedly inspired by Nahua rather than by Maya ideals.\r\n\r\nAccording to Spanish historians, the fourteenth century was characterized\r\nby increasing arrogance and oppression on the part of the rulers of\r\nMayapan, who found it necessary to surround themselves with Nahua allies in\r\norder to keep the rising discontent of their {6} subjects in check.[9] This\r\nunrest finally reached its culmination about the middle of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, when the Maya nobility, unable longer to endure such tyranny,\r\nbanded themselves together under the leadership of the lord of Uxmal,\r\nsacked Mayapan, and slew its ruler.\r\n\r\nAll authorities, native as well as Spanish, agree that the destruction of\r\nMayapan marked the end of strongly centralized government in Yucatan.\r\nIndeed there can be but little doubt that this event also sounded the death\r\nknell of Maya civilization. As one of the native chronicles tersely puts\r\nit, \"The chiefs of the country lost their power.\" With the destruction of\r\nMayapan the country split into a number of warring factions, each bent on\r\nthe downfall of the others. Ancient jealousies and feuds, no longer held in\r\nleash by the restraining hand of Mayapan, doubtless revived, and soon the\r\nland was rent with strife. Presently to the horrors of civil war were added\r\nthose of famine and pestilence, each of which visited the peninsula in\r\nturn, carrying off great numbers of people.\r\n\r\nThese several calamities, however, were but harbingers of worse soon to\r\ncome. In 1517 Francisco de Cordoba landed the first Spanish expedition[10]\r\non the shores of Yucatan. The natives were so hostile, however, that he\r\nreturned to Cuba, having accomplished little more than the discovery of the\r\ncountry. In the following year Juan de Grijalva descended on the peninsula,\r\nbut he, too, met with so determined a resistance that he sailed away,\r\nhaving gained little more than hard knocks for his pains. In the following\r\nyear (1519) Hernando Cortez landed on the northeast coast but reembarked in\r\na few days for Mexico, again leaving the courageous natives to themselves.\r\nSeven years later, however, in 1526, Francisco Montejo, having been granted\r\nthe title of Adelantado of Yucatan, set about the conquest of the country\r\nin earnest. Having obtained the necessary \"sinews of war\" through his\r\nmarriage to a wealthy widow of Seville, he sailed with 3 ships and 500 men\r\nfor Yucatan. He first landed on the island of Cozumel, off the northeast\r\ncoast, but soon proceeded to the mainland and took formal possession of the\r\ncountry in the name of the King of Spain. This empty ceremony soon proved\r\nto be {7} but the prelude to a sanguinary struggle, which broke out almost\r\nimmediately and continued with extraordinary ferocity for many years, the\r\nMaya fighting desperately in defense of their homes. Indeed, it was not\r\nuntil 14 years later, on June 11, 1541 (old style), that, the Spaniards\r\nhaving defeated a coalition of Maya chieftains near the city of\r\nIchcanzihoo, the conquest was finally brought to a close and the\r\npacification of the country accomplished. With this event ends the\r\nindependent history of the Maya.\r\n\r\nMANNERS AND CUSTOMS\r\n\r\nAccording to Bishop Landa,[11] who wrote his remarkable history of Yucatan\r\nin 1565, the Maya of that day were a tall race, active and strong. In\r\nchildhood the forehead was artificially flattened and the ears and nose\r\nwere pierced for the insertion of earrings and nose-ornaments, of which the\r\npeople were very fond. Squint-eye was considered a mark of beauty, and\r\nmothers strove to disfigure their children in this way by suspending\r\npellets of wax between their eyes in order to make them squint, thus\r\nsecuring the desired effect. The faces of the younger boys were scalded by\r\nthe application of hot cloths, to prevent the growth of the beard, which\r\nwas not popular. Both men and women wore their hair long. The former had a\r\nlarge spot burned on the back of the head, where the hair always remained\r\nshort. With the exception of a small queue, which hung down behind, the\r\nhair was gathered around the head in a braid. The women wore a more\r\nbeautiful coiffure divided into two braids. The faces of both sexes were\r\nmuch disfigured as a result of their religious beliefs, which led to the\r\npractice of scarification. Tattooing also was common to both sexes, and\r\nthere were persons in almost every community who were especially proficient\r\nin this art. Both men and women painted themselves red, the former\r\ndecorating their entire bodies, and the latter all except their faces,\r\nwhich modesty decreed should be left unpainted. The women also anointed\r\nthemselves very freely with fragrant gums and perfumes. They filed their\r\nteeth to sharp points, a practice which was thought to enhance their\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\nThe clothing of the men was simple. They wore a breechclout wrapped several\r\ntimes around the loins and tied in such a way that one end fell in front\r\nbetween the legs and the other in the {8} corresponding position behind.\r\nThese breechclouts were carefully embroidered by the women and decorated\r\nwith featherwork. A large square cape hung from the shoulders, and sandals\r\nof hemp or leather completed the costume. For persons of high rank the\r\napparel was much more elaborate, the humble breechclout and cape of the\r\nlaboring man giving place to panaches of gorgeously colored feathers\r\nhanging from wooden helmets, rich mantles of tiger skins, and finely\r\nwrought ornaments of gold and jade.\r\n\r\nThe women sometimes wore a simple petticoat, and a cloth covering the\r\nbreasts and passing under the arms. More often their costume consisted of a\r\nsingle loose sacklike garment called the _hipil_, which reached to the feet\r\nand had slits for the arms. This garment, with the addition of a cloth or\r\nscarf wrapped around the shoulders, constituted the women's clothing a\r\nthousand years ago, just as it does to-day.\r\n\r\nIn ancient times the women were very chaste and modest. When they passed\r\nmen on the road, they stepped to one side, turning their backs and hiding\r\ntheir faces. The age of marriage was about 20, although children were\r\nfrequently affianced when very young. When boys arrived at a marriageable\r\nage their fathers consulted the professional matchmakers of the community,\r\nto whom arrangements for marriage were ordinarily intrusted, it being\r\nconsidered vulgar for parents or their sons to take an active part in\r\narranging these affairs. Having sought out the girl's parents, the\r\nmatchmaker arranged with them the matter of the dowry, which the young\r\nman's father paid, his wife at the same time giving the necessary clothing\r\nfor her son and prospective daughter-in-law. On the day of the wedding the\r\nrelatives and guests assembled at the house of the young man's parents,\r\nwhere a great feast had been prepared. Having satisfied himself that the\r\nyoung couple had sufficiently considered the grave step they were about to\r\ntake, the priest gave the bride to her husband. The ceremony closed with a\r\nfeast in which all participated. Immediately after the wedding the young\r\nhusband went to the home of his wife's parents, where he was obliged to\r\nwork five or six years for his board. If he refused to comply with this\r\ncustom he was driven from the house, and the marriage presumably was\r\nannulled. This step seems rarely to have been necessary, however, and the\r\nmother-in-law on her part saw to it that her daughter fed the young husband\r\nregularly, a practice which betokened their recognition of the marriage\r\nrite.\r\n\r\nWidowers and widows married without ceremony, it being considered\r\nsufficient for a widower to call on his prospective wife and eat in her\r\nhouse. Marriage between people of the same name was considered an evil\r\npractice, possibly in deference to some former exogamic law. It was thought\r\nimproper to marry a mother-in-law or an aunt {9} by marriage, or a\r\nsister-in-law; otherwise a man could marry whom he would, even his first\r\ncousin.\r\n\r\nThe Maya were of a very jealous nature and divorces were frequent. These\r\nwere effected merely by the desertion of the husband or wife, as the case\r\nmight be. The parents tried to bring the couple together and effect a\r\nreconciliation, but if their efforts proved unsuccessful both parties were\r\nat liberty to remarry. If there were young children the mother kept them;\r\nif the children were of age the sons followed the father, the daughters\r\nremaining with their mother. Although divorce was of common occurrence, it\r\nwas condemned by the more respectable members of the community. It is\r\ninteresting to note that polygamy was unknown among the Maya.\r\n\r\nAgriculture was the chief pursuit, corn and other grains being extensively\r\ncultivated, and stored against time of need in well-appointed granaries.\r\nLabor was largely communal; all hands joined to do one another's work.\r\nBands of twenty or more each, passing from field to field throughout the\r\ncommunity, quickly finished sowing or harvesting. This communal idea was\r\ncarried to the chase, fifty or more men frequently going out together to\r\nhunt. At the conclusion of these expeditions the meat was roasted and then\r\ncarried back to town. First, the lord of the district was given his share,\r\nafter which the remainder was distributed among the hunters and their\r\nfriends. Communal fishing parties are also mentioned.\r\n\r\nAnother occupation in high favor was that of trade or commerce. Salt,\r\ncloth, and slaves were the chief articles of barter; these were carried as\r\nfar as Tabasco. Cocoa, stone counters, and highly prized red shells of a\r\npeculiar kind were the media of exchange. These were accepted in return for\r\nall the products of the country, even including the finely worked stones,\r\njades possibly, with which the chiefs adorned themselves at their fetes.\r\nCredit was asked and given, all debts were honestly paid, and no usury was\r\nexacted.\r\n\r\nThe sense of justice among the Maya was highly developed. If a man\r\ncommitted an offense against one of another village, the former's lord\r\ncaused satisfaction to be rendered, otherwise the communities would come to\r\nblows. Troubles between men of the same village were taken to a judge, who\r\nhaving heard both sides, fixed appropriate damages. If the malefactor could\r\nnot pay these, the obligation extended to his wife and relatives. Crimes\r\nwhich could be satisfied by the payment of an indemnity were accidental\r\nkillings, quarrels between man and wife, and the accidental destruction of\r\nproperty by fire. Malicious mischief could be atoned for only by blows and\r\nthe shedding of blood. The punishment of murder was left in the hands of\r\nthe deceased's relatives, who were at liberty to exact an indemnity or the\r\nmurderer's life as they pleased. The thief was obliged to make good\r\nwhatever he had stolen, no matter how little; in event of failure to do so\r\nhe was reduced to slavery. Adultery was punishable by {10} death. The\r\nadulterer was led into the courtyard of the chief's house, where all had\r\nassembled, and after being tied to a stake, was turned over to the mercies\r\nof the outraged husband, who either pardoned him or crushed his head with a\r\nheavy rock. As for the guilty woman, her infamy was deemed sufficient\r\npunishment for her, though usually her husband abandoned her.\r\n\r\nThe Maya were a very hospitable people, always offering food and drink to\r\nthe stranger within their gates, and sharing with him to the last crumb.\r\nThey were much given to conviviality, particularly the lords, who\r\nfrequently entertained one another with elaborate feasts, accompanied by\r\nmusic and dancing, expending at times on a single occasion the proceeds of\r\nmany days' accumulation. They usually sat down to eat by twos or fours. The\r\nmeal, which consisted of vegetable stews, roast meats, corn cakes, and\r\ncocoa (to mention only a few of the viands) was spread upon mats laid on\r\nthe ground. After the repast was finished beautiful young girls acting as\r\ncupbearers passed among the guests, plying them industriously with wine\r\nuntil all were drunk. Before departing each guest was presented with a\r\nhandsome vase and pedestal, with a cloth cover therefor. At these orgies\r\ndrinking was frequently carried to such excess that the wives of the guests\r\nwere obliged to come for their besotted husbands and drag them home. Each\r\nof the guests at such a banquet was required to give one in return, and not\r\neven death could stay the payment of a debt of this kind, since the\r\nobligation descended to the recipient's heirs. The poor entertained less\r\nlavishly, as became their means. Guests at the humbler feasts, moreover,\r\nwere not obliged to return them in kind.\r\n\r\nThe chief amusements of the Maya were comedies and dances, in both of which\r\nthey exhibited much skill and ingenuity. There was a variety of musical\r\ninstruments--drums of several kinds, rattles, reed flutes, wooden horns,\r\nand bone whistles. Their music is described as having been sad, owing\r\nperhaps to the melancholy sound of the instruments which produced it.\r\n\r\nThe frequent wars which darken the final pages of Maya history doubtless\r\ndeveloped the military organization to a high degree of efficiency. At the\r\nhead of the army stood two generals, one hereditary and the other elective\r\n(_nacon_), the latter serving for three years. In each village throughout\r\nthe country certain men (_holcanes_) were chosen to act as soldiers; these\r\nconstituted a kind of a standing army, thoroughly trained in the art of\r\nwar. They were supported by the community, and in times of peace caused\r\nmuch disturbance, continuing the tumult of war after war had ceased. In\r\ntimes of great stress when it became necessary to call on all able-bodied\r\nmen for military service, the holcanes mustered all those available in\r\ntheir respective districts and trained them in the use of arms. There were\r\nbut few weapons: Wooden bows strung with hemp cords, and arrows {11} tipped\r\nwith obsidian or bone; long lances with sharp flint points; and metal\r\n(probably copper) axes, provided with wooden handles. The defensive armor\r\nconsisted of round wicker shields strengthened with deer hide, and quilted\r\ncotton coats, which were said to have extraordinary resisting power against\r\nthe native weapons. The highest chiefs wore wooden helmets decorated with\r\nbrilliant plumes, and cloaks of \"tiger\" (jaguar) skin, thrown over their\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\nWith a great banner at their head the troops silently stole out of the\r\ncity, and moved against the enemy, hoping thus to surprise them. When the\r\nenemies' position had been ascertained, they fell on them suddenly with\r\nextraordinary ferocity, uttering loud cries. Barricades of trees, brush,\r\nand stone were used in defense, behind which archers stood, who endeavored\r\nto repulse the attack. After a battle the victors mutilated the bodies of\r\nthe slain, cutting out the jawbones and cleaning them of flesh. These were\r\nworn as bracelets after the flesh had been removed. At the conclusion of\r\ntheir wars the spoils were offered in sacrifice. If by chance some leader\r\nor chief had been captured, he was sacrificed as an offering particularly\r\nacceptable to the gods. Other prisoners became the slaves of those who had\r\ncaptured them.\r\n\r\nThe Maya entertained an excessive and constant fear of death, many of their\r\nreligious practices having no other end in view than that of warding off\r\nthe dread visitor. After death there followed a prolonged period of sadness\r\nin the bereaved family, the days being given over to fasting, and the more\r\nrestrained indulgence in grief, and the nights to dolorous cries and\r\nlamentations, most pitiful to hear. Among the common people the dead were\r\nwrapped in shrouds; their mouths were filled with ground corn and bits of\r\nworked stone so that they should not lack for food and money in the life to\r\ncome. The Maya buried their dead inside the houses[12] or behind them,\r\nputting into the tomb idols, and objects indicating the profession of the\r\ndeceased--if a priest, some of his sacred books; if a seer, some of his\r\ndivinatory paraphernalia. A house was commonly abandoned after a death\r\ntherein, unless enough remained in the household to dispel the fear which\r\nalways followed such an occurrence.\r\n\r\nIn the higher walks of life the mortuary customs were more elaborate. The\r\nbodies of chiefs and others of high estate were burned and their ashes\r\nplaced in large pottery vessels. These were buried in the ground and\r\ntemples erected over them.[13] When the deceased {12} was of very high rank\r\nthe pottery sarcophagus took the form of a human statue. A variant of the\r\nabove procedure was to burn only a part of the body, inclosing the ashes in\r\nthe hollow head of a wooden statue, and sealing them in with a piece of\r\nskin taken from the back of the dead man's skull. The rest of the body was\r\nburied. Such statues were jealously preserved among the figures of the\r\ngods, being held in deep veneration.\r\n\r\nThe lords of Mayapan had still another mortuary practice. After death the\r\nhead was severed from the body and cooked in order to remove all flesh. It\r\nwas then sawed in half from side to side, care being taken to preserve the\r\njaw, nose, eyes, and forehead in one piece. Upon this as a form the\r\nfeatures of the dead man were filled in with a kind of a gum. Such was\r\ntheir extraordinary skill in this peculiar work that the finished mask is\r\nsaid to have appeared exactly like the countenance in life. The carefully\r\nprepared faces, together with the statues containing the ashes of the dead,\r\nwere deposited with their idols. Every feast day meats were set before them\r\nso they should lack for nothing in that other world whither they had gone.\r\n\r\nVery little is known about the governmental organization of the southern\r\nMaya, and it seems best, therefore, first to examine conditions in the\r\nnorth, concerning which the early authorities, native as well as Spanish,\r\nhave much to say. The northern Maya lived in settlements, some of very\r\nconsiderable extent, under the rule of hereditary chiefs called _halach\r\nuinicil_, or \"real men,\" who were, in fact as well as name, the actual\r\nrulers of the country. The settlements tributary to each _halach uinic_\r\nwere doubtless connected by tribal ties, based on real or fancied blood\r\nrelationship.\r\n\r\nDuring the period of the Triple Alliance (1000-1200 A. D.) there were\r\nprobably only three of these embryonic nations: Chichen Itza, Uxmal, and\r\nMayapan, among which the country seems to have been apportioned. After the\r\nconquest of Chichen Itza, however, the halach uinic of Mayapan probably\r\nattempted to establish a more autocratic form of government, arrogating to\r\nhimself still greater power. The Spanish authorities relate that the chiefs\r\nof the country assembled at Mayapan, acknowledged the ruler of that city as\r\ntheir overlord, and finally agreed to live there, each binding himself at\r\nthe same time to conduct the affairs of his own domain through a deputy.\r\n\r\nThis attempt to unite the country under one head and bring about a further\r\ncentralization of power ultimately failed, as has been seen, through the\r\ntyranny of the Cocom family, in which the office of halach uinic of Mayapan\r\nwas vested. This tyranny led to the overthrow of the Cocoms and the\r\ndestruction of centralized government, so that when the Spaniards arrived\r\nthey found a number of petty chieftains, acknowledging no overlord, and the\r\ncountry in chaos.\r\n\r\nThe powers of the halach uinic are not clearly understood. He seems to have\r\nstood at the apex of the governmental organization, and {13} doubtless his\r\nwill prevailed just so far as he had sufficient strength to enforce it. The\r\n_batabs_, or underchiefs, were obliged to visit him and render him their\r\nhomage. They also accompanied him in his tours about the country, which\r\nalways gave rise to feasting back and forth. Finally they advised him on\r\nall important matters. The office would seem to have been no stronger in\r\nany case than its incumbent, since we hear of the halach uinic of Mayapan\r\nbeing obliged to surround himself with foreign troops in order to hold his\r\npeople in check.\r\n\r\nEach batab governed the territory of which he was the hereditary ruler,\r\ninstructing his heir in the duties of the position, and counseling that he\r\ntreat the poor with benevolence and maintain peace and encourage industry,\r\nso that all might live in plenty. He settled all lawsuits, and through\r\ntrusted lieutenants ordered and adjusted the various affairs of his domain.\r\nWhen he went abroad from his city or even from his house a great crowd\r\naccompanied him. He often visited his underchiefs, holding court in their\r\nhouses, and meeting at night in council to discuss matters touching the\r\ncommon good. The batabs frequently entertained one another with dancing,\r\nhunting, and feasting. The people as a community tilled the batab's fields,\r\nreaped his corn, and supplied his wants in general. The underchiefs were\r\nsimilarly provided for, each according to his rank and needs.\r\n\r\nThe _ahkulel_, the next highest official in each district, acted as the\r\nbatab's deputy or representative; he carried a short thick baton in token\r\nof his office. He had charge of the localities subject to his master's rule\r\nas well as of the officers immediately over them. He kept these assistants\r\ninformed as to what was needed in the batab's house, as birds, game, fish,\r\ncorn, honey, salt, and cloth, which they supplied when called on. The\r\nahkulel was, in short, a chief steward, and his house was the batab's\r\nbusiness office.\r\n\r\nAnother important position was that of the _nacon_, or war-chief. In times\r\nof war this functionary was second only to the hereditary chief, or batab,\r\nand was greatly venerated by all. His office was elective, the term being\r\nthree years, during which he was obliged to refrain from intercourse with\r\nwomen, and to hold himself aloof from all.\r\n\r\nAn important civil position was that held by the _ahholpop_, in whose\r\nkeeping was the _tunkul_, or wooden drum, used in summoning people to the\r\ndances and public meetings, or as a tocsin in case of war. He had charge\r\nalso of the \"town hall\" in which all public business was transacted.\r\n\r\nThe question of succession is important. Bishop Landa distinctly states in\r\none passage \"That when the lord died, although his oldest son succeeded\r\nhim, the others were always loved and served and even regarded as lords.\"\r\nThis would seem to indicate definitely that descent was by primogeniture.\r\nHowever, another passage suggests that the oldest son did not always\r\nsucceed his father: \"The lords were the governors and confirmed their sons\r\nin their offices if they {14} [the sons] were acceptable.\" This suggests\r\nthe possibility, at least, that primogeniture could sometimes be set aside,\r\nparticularly when the first-born lacked the necessary qualifications for\r\nleadership. In a somewhat drawn-out statement the same authority discusses\r\nthe question of \"princely succession\" among the Maya:\r\n\r\n    If the children were too young to be intrusted with the management of\r\n    their own affairs, these were turned over to a guardian, the nearest\r\n    relation. He gave the children to their mothers to bring up, because\r\n    according to their usage the mother has no power of her own. When the\r\n    guardian was the brother of the deceased [the children's paternal\r\n    uncle] they take the children from their mother. These guardians give\r\n    what was intrusted to them to the heirs when they come of age, and not\r\n    to do so was considered a great dishonesty and was the cause of much\r\n    contention.... If when the lord died there were no sons [ready, i. e.,\r\n    of age] to rule and he had brothers, the oldest or most capable of his\r\n    brothers ruled, and they [the guardians] showed the heir the customs\r\n    and fetes of his people until he should be a man, and these brothers,\r\n    although the heir were [ready] to rule, commanded all their lives, and,\r\n    if there were no brothers the priests and principal people selected a\r\n    man suitable for the position.[14]\r\n\r\nThe foregoing would seem to imply that the rulers were succeeded by their\r\neldest sons if the latter were of age and otherwise generally acceptable;\r\nand that, if they were minors when their fathers died, their paternal\r\nuncles, if any, or otherwise some capable man selected by the priests, took\r\nthe reins of government, instructing the heir in the duties of the position\r\nwhich he was to occupy some day; and finally that the regent did not lay\r\ndown his authority until death, even though the heir had previously\r\nattained his majority. This custom is so unusual that its existence may\r\nwell be doubted, and it is not at all improbable that Bishop Landa's\r\nstatement to the contrary may have arisen from some misapprehension.\r\nPrimogeniture was not confined to the executive succession alone, since\r\nBishop Landa states further that the high priest _Ahau can mai_ was\r\nsucceeded in his dignity by his sons, or those next of kin.\r\n\r\nNepotism doubtless prevailed extensively, all the higher offices of the\r\npriesthood as well as the executive offices being hereditary, and in all\r\nprobability filled with members of the halach uinic's family.\r\n\r\nThe priests instructed the younger sons of the ruling family as well as\r\ntheir own, in the priestly duties and learning; in the computation of\r\nyears, months, and days; in unlucky times; in fetes and ceremonies; in the\r\nadministration of the sacraments; in the practices of prophecy and\r\ndivination; in treating the sick; in their ancient history; and finally in\r\nthe art of reading and writing their hieroglyphics, which was taught only\r\nto those of high degree. Genealogies were carefully preserved, the term\r\nmeaning \"of noble birth\" being _ah kaba_, \"he who has a name.\" The\r\nelaborate attention given to the subject of lineage, and the exclusive\r\nright of the _ah kaba_ to the benefits of education, show that in the\r\nnorthern part of the Maya territory at least government rested on the\r\nprinciple of hereditary succession. The accounts of native as well as of\r\nSpanish writers leave the impression that a system not unlike a modified\r\nform of feudalism prevailed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM SHOWING PERIODS OF OCCUPANCY OF PRINCIPAL SOUTHERN\r\nCITIES]\r\n\r\n{15} In attempting to gain an approximate understanding of the form of\r\ngovernment which existed in the southern part of the Maya territory it is\r\nnecessary in the absence of all documentary information to interpret the\r\nsouthern chronology, architecture, and sculpture--practically all that\r\nremains of the older culture--in the light of the known conditions in the\r\nnorth. The chronology of the several southern cities (see pl. 2) indicates\r\nthat many of them were contemporaneous, and that a few, namely, Tikal,\r\nNaranjo, Palenque, and Copan were occupied approximately 200 years, a much\r\nlonger period than any of the others.[15] These four would seem to have\r\nbeen centers of population for a long time, and at least three of them,\r\nTikal, Palenque, and Copan, attained considerable size. Indeed they may\r\nwell have been, like Chichen Itza, Uxmal, and Mayapan, at a later epoch in\r\nthe north, the seats of halach uincil, or overlords, to whom all the\r\nsurrounding chiefs were tributary. Geographically considered, the country\r\nwas well apportioned among these cities: Tikal dominating the north,\r\nPalenque, the west, and Copan, the south.\r\n\r\nThe architecture, sculpture, and hieroglyphic writing of all the southern\r\ncenters is practically identical, even to the borrowing of unessential\r\ndetails, a condition which indicates a homogeneity only to be accounted for\r\nby long-continued and frequent intercourse. This characteristic of the\r\nculture, together with the location and contemporaneity of its largest\r\ncenters, suggests that originally the southern territory was divided into\r\nseveral extensive political divisions, all in close intercourse with one\r\nanother, and possibly united in a league similar to that which later united\r\nthe principal cities of the north. The unmistakable priestly or religious\r\ncharacter of the sculptures in the southern area clearly indicates the\r\npeaceful temper of the people, and the conspicuous absence of warlike\r\nsubjects points strongly to the fact that the government was a theocracy,\r\nthe highest official in the priesthood being at the same time, by virtue of\r\nhis sacerdotal rank, the highest civil authority. Whether the principle of\r\nhereditary succession determined or even influenced the selection of rulers\r\nin the south is impossible to say. However, since the highest offices, both\r\nexecutive and priestly, in the north were thus filled, it may be assumed\r\nthat similar conditions prevailed in the south, particularly as the\r\nnorthern civilization was but an outgrowth of the {16} southern. There is\r\nsome ground for believing that the highest office in the south may have\r\nbeen elective, the term being a _hotun_[16] (1,800 days), and the choice\r\nrestricted to the members of a certain family. The existence of this\r\nrestriction, which closely parallels the Aztec procedure in selecting\r\nrulers,[17] rests on very slender evidence, however, so far as the Maya are\r\nconcerned and is mentioned here simply by way of suggestion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. Itzamna, chief deity of the Maya Pantheon (note his\r\nname glyphs, below).]\r\n\r\nThe religion of the ancient Maya was polytheistic, its pantheon containing\r\nabout a dozen major deities and a host of lesser ones. At its head stood\r\nItzamna, the father of the gods and creator of mankind, the Mayan Zeus or\r\nJupiter. He was the personification of the East, the rising sun, and, by\r\nassociation, of light, life, and knowledge. He was the founder of the Maya\r\ncivilization, the first priest of the Maya religion, the inventor of\r\nwriting and books, and the great healer. Whether Itzamna has been\r\nidentified with any of the deities in the ancient Maya picture-writings is\r\nuncertain, though there are strong reasons for believing that this deity is\r\nthe god represented in figure 1. His characteristics here are: The aged\r\nface, Roman nose, and sunken toothless mouth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2. Kukulcan, God of Learning (note his name glyph,\r\nbelow).]\r\n\r\nScarcely less important was the great god Kukulcan, or Feathered Serpent,\r\nthe personification of the West. It is related of him that he came into\r\nYucatan from the west and settled at Chichen Itza, where he ruled for many\r\nyears and built a great temple. During his sojourn he is said to have\r\nfounded the city of Mayapan, which later became so important. Finally,\r\nhaving brought the country out of war and dissension to peace and\r\nprosperity, he left by the same way he had entered, tarrying only at\r\nChakanputun on the west coast to build a splendid temple as an everlasting\r\nmemorial of his residence among the people. After his departure he was\r\nworshipped as a god because of what he had done for the public good.\r\nKukulcan was the Maya counterpart of the Aztec Quetzalcoatl, the Mexican\r\ngod of light, learning, and culture. In the Maya pantheon he was regarded\r\nas having been the great organizer, the founder of cities, the framer of\r\nlaws, and the teacher of their new calendar. Indeed, his attributes {17}\r\nand life history are so human that it is not improbable he may have been an\r\nactual historical character, some great lawgiver and organizer, the memory\r\nof whose benefactions lingered long after death, and whose personality was\r\neventually deified. The episodes of his life suggest he may have been the\r\nrecolonizer of Chichen Itza after the destruction of Chakanputun. Kukulcan\r\nhas been identified by some as the \"old god\" of the picture-writings (fig.\r\n2), whose characteristics are: Two deformed teeth, one protruding from the\r\nfront and one from the back part of his mouth, and the long tapering nose.\r\nHe is to be distinguished further by his peculiar headdress.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3. Ahpuch, God of Death (note his name glyphs, below).]\r\n\r\nThe most feared and hated of all the Maya deities was Ahpuch, the Lord of\r\nDeath, God \"Barebones\" as an early manuscript calls him, from whom evil and\r\nespecially death were thought to come. He is frequently represented in the\r\npicture-writings (fig. 3), usually in connection with the idea of death. He\r\nis associated with human sacrifice, suicide by hanging, death in\r\nchildbirth, and the beheaded captive. His characteristics are typical and\r\nunmistakable. His head is the fleshless skull, showing the truncated nose,\r\nthe grinning teeth, and fleshless lower jaw, sometimes even the cranial\r\nsutures are portrayed. In some places the ribs and vertebrae are shown, in\r\nothers the body is spotted black as if to suggest the discoloration of\r\ndeath. A very constant symbol is the stiff feather collar with small bells\r\nattached. These bells also appear as ornaments on the head, arms, and\r\nankles. The to us familiar crossbones were also another Maya death symbol.\r\nEven the hieroglyph of this god (fig. 3) suggests the dread idea for which\r\nhe stood. Note the eye closed in death.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4. The God of War (note his name glyph, below).]\r\n\r\nClosely associated with the God of Death is the God of War, who probably\r\nstood as well for the larger idea of death by violence. He is characterized\r\n(fig. 4) by a black line painted on his face, sometimes curving, sometimes\r\nstraight, supposed to be symbolical of war paint, or, according to others,\r\nof his gaping wounds. He appears in the picture-writings as the Death God's\r\ncompanion. He presides with him over the body of a sacrificial victim, and\r\nagain follows him applying torch and knife to the habitations of man. His\r\nhieroglyph shows as its characteristic the line of black paint (fig. 4).\r\n\r\nAnother unpropitious deity was Ek Ahau, the Black Captain, also a war god,\r\nbeing represented (fig. 5) in the picture-writings as armed {18} with a\r\nspear or an ax. It was said of him that he was a very great and very cruel\r\nwarrior, who commanded a band of seven blackamoors like himself. He is\r\ncharacterized by his black color, his drooping lower lip, and the two\r\ncurved lines at the right of his eye. His hieroglyph is a black eye (fig.\r\n5).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5. Ek Ahau, the Black Captain, war deity (note his name\r\nglyph, below).]\r\n\r\nContrasted with these gods of death, violence, and destruction was the\r\nMaize God, Yum Kaax, Lord of the Harvest Fields (fig. 6). Here we have one\r\nof the most important figures in the whole Maya pantheon, the god of\r\nhusbandry and the fruits of the earth, of fertility and prosperity, of\r\ngrowth and plenty. The Maize God was as well disposed toward mankind as\r\nAhpuch and his companions were unpropitious. In many of the\r\npicture-writings Yum Kaax is represented as engaged in agricultural\r\npursuits. He is portrayed as having for his head-dress a sprouting ear of\r\ncorn surrounded by leaves, symbolic of growth, for which he stands. Even\r\nthe hieroglyph of this deity (fig. 6) embodies the same idea, the god's\r\nhead merging into the conventionalized ear of corn surrounded by leaves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6. Yum Kaax, Lord of the Harvest (note his name glyph,\r\nbelow).]\r\n\r\nAnother important deity about whom little or nothing is known was Xaman Ek,\r\nthe North Star. He is spoken of as the \"guide of the merchants,\" and in\r\nkeeping with that character is associated in the picture-writings with\r\nsymbols of peace and plenty. His one characteristic seems to be his curious\r\nhead, which also serves as his name hieroglyph (fig. 7).\r\n\r\nOther Maya deities were: Ixchel, the Rainbow, consort of Itzamna and\r\ngoddess of childbirth and medicine; Ixtab, patroness of hunting and\r\nhanging; Ixtubtun, protectress of jade cutters; Ixchebelyax, the inventress\r\nof painting and color designing as applied to fabrics.\r\n\r\nAlthough the deities above described represent only a small fraction of the\r\nMaya pantheon, they include, beyond all doubt, its most important members,\r\nthe truly great, who held the powers of life and death, peace and war,\r\nplenty and famine--who were, in short, the arbiters of human destiny.\r\n\r\nThe Maya conceived the earth to be a cube, which supported the celestial\r\nvase resting on its four legs, the four cardinal points. Out of this grew\r\nthe Tree of Life, the flowers of which were the immortal principle of man,\r\nthe soul. Above hung heavy clouds, the fructifying waters upon which all\r\ngrowth and life depend. The religion was dualistic in spirit, a constant\r\nstruggle between the powers of {19} light and of darkness. On one side were\r\narrayed the gods of plenty, peace, and life; on the other those of want,\r\nwar, and destruction; and between these two there waged an unending strife\r\nfor the control of man. This struggle between the powers of light and\r\ndarkness is graphically portrayed in the picture-writings. Where the God of\r\nLife plants the tree, Death breaks it in twain (fig. 8); where the former\r\noffers food, the latter raises an empty vase symbolizing famine; where one\r\nbuilds, the other destroys. The contrast is complete, the conflict eternal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7. Xaman Ek, the North Star God (note his name glyph,\r\nbelow).]\r\n\r\nThe Maya believed in the immortality of the soul and in a spiritual life\r\nhereafter. As a man lived in this world so he was rewarded in the next. The\r\ngood and righteous went to a heaven of material delights, a place where\r\nrich foods never failed and pain and sorrow were unknown. The wicked were\r\nconsigned to a hell called Mitnal, over which ruled the archdemon Hunhau\r\nand his minions; and here in hunger, cold, and exhaustion they suffered\r\neverlasting torment. The materialism of the Maya heaven and hell need not\r\nsurprise, nor lower our estimate of their civilization. Similar realistic\r\nconceptions of the hereafter have been entertained by peoples much higher\r\nin the cultural scale than the Maya.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8. Conflict between the Gods of Life and Death\r\n(Kukulcan and Ahpuch).]\r\n\r\nWorship doubtless was the most important feature of the Maya scheme of\r\nexistence, and an endless succession of rites and ceremonies was considered\r\nnecessary to retain the sympathies of the good gods and to propitiate the\r\nmalevolent ones. Bishop Landa says that the aim and object of all Maya\r\nceremonies were to secure three things only: Health, life, and sustenance;\r\nmodest enough requests to ask of any faith. The first step in all Maya\r\nreligious rites was the expulsion of the evil spirits from the midst of the\r\nworshipers. This was accomplished sometimes by prayers and benedictions,\r\nset formulæ of proven efficacy, and sometimes by special sacrifices and\r\nofferings.\r\n\r\nIt would take us too far afield to describe here even the more important\r\nceremonies of the Maya religion. Their number was literally legion, and\r\nthey answered almost every contingency within the range of human\r\nexperience. First of all were the ceremonies dedicated to special gods, as\r\nItzamna, Kukulcan, and Ixchel. Probably every deity in the pantheon, even\r\nthe most insignificant, had at least one rite a year addressed to it alone,\r\nand the aggregate must have made a very considerable number. In addition\r\nthere were the annual feasts of the ritualistic year brought around by the\r\never-recurring {20} seasons. Here may be mentioned the numerous ceremonies\r\nincident to the beginning of the new year and the end of the old, as the\r\nrenewal of household utensils and the general renovation of all articles,\r\nwhich took place at this tine; the feasts of the various trades and\r\noccupations--the hunters, fishers, and apiarists, the farmers, carpenters,\r\nand potters, the stonecutters, wood carvers, and metal workers--each guild\r\nhaving its own patron deity, whose services formed another large group of\r\nceremonials. A third class comprised the rites of a more personal nature,\r\nthose connected with baptism, confession, marriage, setting out on\r\njourneys, and the like. Finally, there was a fourth group of ceremonies,\r\nheld much less frequently than the others, but of far greater importance.\r\nHerein fall the ceremonies held on extraordinary occasions, as famine,\r\ndrought, pestilence, victory, or defeat, which were probably solemnized by\r\nrites of human sacrifice.\r\n\r\nThe direction of so elaborate a system of worship necessitated a numerous\r\nand highly organized priesthood. At the head of the hierarchy stood the\r\nhereditary high priest, or _ahaucan mai_, a functionary of very\r\nconsiderable power. Although he had no actual share in the government, his\r\ninfluence was none the less far-reaching, since the highest lords sought\r\nhis advice, and deferred to his judgment in the administration of their\r\naffairs. They questioned him concerning the will of the gods on various\r\npoints, and he in response framed the divine replies, a duty which gave him\r\ntremendous power and authority. In the ahuacan mai was vested also the\r\nexclusive right to fill vacancies in the priesthood. He examined candidates\r\non their knowledge of the priestly services and ceremonies, and after their\r\nappointment directed them in the discharge of their duties. He rarely\r\nofficiated at sacrifices except on occasions of the greatest importance, as\r\nat the principal feasts or in times of general need. His office was\r\nmaintained by presents from the lords and enforced contributions from the\r\npriesthood throughout the country.\r\n\r\nThe priesthood included within its ranks women as well as men. The duties\r\nwere highly specialized and there were many different ranks and grades in\r\nthe hierarchy. The _chilan_ was one of the most important. This priest was\r\ncarried upon the shoulders of the people when he appeared in public. He\r\ntaught their sciences, appointed the holy days, healed the sick, offered\r\nsacrifices, and most important of all, gave the responses of the gods to\r\npetitioners. The _ahuai chac_ was a priest who brought the rains on which\r\nthe prosperity of the country was wholly dependent. The _ah macik_ conjured\r\nthe winds; the _ahpul_ caused sickness and induced sleep; the _ahuai\r\nxibalba_ communed with the dead. At the bottom of the ladder seems to have\r\nstood the _nacon_, whose duty it was to open the breasts of the sacrificed\r\nvictims. An important elective office in each community was that held by\r\nthe _chac_, or priest's assistant. These officials, of which there {21}\r\nwere four, were elected from the _nucteelob_, or village wise men. They\r\nserved for a term of one year and could never be reelected. They aided the\r\npriest in the various ceremonies of the year, officiating in minor\r\ncapacities. Their duties seem to have been not unlike those of the\r\nsacristan in the Roman Catholic Church of to-day.\r\n\r\nIn closing this introduction nothing could be more appropriate than to call\r\nattention once more to the supreme importance of religion in the life of\r\nthe ancient Maya. Religion was indeed the very fountain-head of their\r\ncivilization, and on its rites and observances they lavished a devotion\r\nrarely equaled in the annals of man. To its great uplifting force was due\r\nthe conception and evolution of the hieroglyphic writing and calendar,\r\nalike the invention and the exclusive property of the priesthood. To its\r\nneed for sanctuary may be attributed the origin of Maya architecture; to\r\nits desire for expression, the rise of Maya sculpture. All activities\r\nreflected its powerful influence and all were more or less dominated by its\r\nneeds and teachings. In short, religion was the foundation upon which the\r\nstructure of the Maya civilization was reared. {22}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. THE MAYA HIEROGLYPHIC WRITING\r\n\r\nThe inscriptions herein described are found throughout the region formerly\r\noccupied by the Maya people (pl. 1), though by far the greater number have\r\nbeen discovered at the southern, or older, sites. This is due in part, at\r\nleast, to the minor role played by sculpture as an independent art among\r\nthe northern Maya, for in the north architecture gradually absorbed in its\r\ndecoration the sculptural activity of the people which in the south had\r\nbeen applied in the making of the hieroglyphic monuments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9. Outlines of the glyphs: _a_, _b_, In the codices;\r\n_c_, in the inscriptions.]\r\n\r\nThe materials upon which the Maya glyphs are presented are stone, wood,\r\nstucco, bone, shell, metal, plaster, pottery, and fiber-paper; the\r\nfirst-mentioned, however, occurs more frequently than all of the others\r\ncombined. Texts have been found carved on the wooden lintels of Tikal,\r\nmolded in the stucco reliefs of Palenque, scratched on shells from Copan\r\nand Belize, etched on a bone from Wild Cane Key, British Honduras, engraved\r\non metal from Chichen Itza, drawn on the plaster-covered walls of Kabah,\r\nChichen Itza, and Uxmal, and painted in fiber-paper books. All of these,\r\nhowever, with the exception of the first and the last (the inscriptions on\r\nstone and the fiber-paper books or codices) just mentioned, occur so rarely\r\nthat they may be dismissed from present consideration.\r\n\r\nThe stones bearing inscriptions are found in a variety of shapes, the\r\ncommonest being the monolithic shafts or slabs known as _stelæ_. Some of\r\nthe shaft-stelæ attain a height of twenty-six feet (above ground); these\r\nare not unlike roughly squared obelisks, with human figures carved on the\r\nobverse and the reverse, and glyphs on the other faces. Slab-stelæ, on the\r\nother hand, are shorter and most of them bear inscriptions only on the\r\nreverse. Frequently associated with these stelæ are smaller monoliths known\r\nas \"altars,\" which vary greatly in size, shape, and decoration, some\r\nbearing glyphs and others being without them.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing monuments, however, by no means exhaust the list of stone\r\nobjects that bear hieroglyphs. As an adjunct to architecture inscriptions\r\noccur on wall-slabs at Palenque, on lintels at Yaxchilan and Piedras\r\nNegras, on steps and stairways at Copan, and on piers and architraves at\r\nHolactun; and these do not include the great number of smaller pieces, as\r\ninscribed jades and the like. Most of the glyphs in the inscriptions are\r\nsquare in outline except for rounded corners (fig. 9, _c_). Those in the\r\ncodices, on the other hand, approximate more nearly in form rhomboids or\r\neven ovals (fig. 9, _a_, _b_). This difference in outline, however, is only\r\nsuperficial in significance and involves no corresponding difference in\r\nmeaning between {23} otherwise identical glyphs; it is due entirely to the\r\nmechanical dissimilarity of the two materials. Disregarding this\r\nconsideration as unessential, we may say that the glyphs in both the\r\ninscriptions and the codices belong to one and the same system of writing,\r\nand if it were possible to read either, the other could no longer withhold\r\nits meaning from us.\r\n\r\nIn Maya inscriptions the glyphs are arranged in parallel columns, which are\r\nto be read two columns at a time, beginning with the uppermost glyph in the\r\nleft-hand column, and then from left to right and top to bottom, ending\r\nwith the lowest glyph in the second column. Then the next two columns are\r\nread in the same order, and so on. In reading glyphs in a horizontal band,\r\nthe order is from left to right in pairs. The writer knows of no text in\r\nwhich the above order of reading is not followed.\r\n\r\nA brief examination of any Maya text, from either the inscriptions or the\r\ncodices, reveals the presence of certain elements which occur repeatedly\r\nbut in varying combinations. The apparent multiplicity of these\r\ncombinations leads at first to the conclusion that a great number of signs\r\nwere employed in Maya writing, but closer study will show that, as compared\r\nwith the composite characters or glyphs proper, the simple elements are few\r\nin number. Says Doctor Brinton (1894 b: p. 10) in this connection: \"If we\r\npositively knew the meaning ... of a hundred or so of these simple\r\nelements, none of the inscriptions could conceal any longer from us the\r\ngeneral tenor of its contents.\" Unfortunately, it must be admitted that but\r\nlittle advance has been made toward the solution of this problem, perhaps\r\nbecause later students have distrusted the highly fanciful results achieved\r\nby the earlier writers who \"interpreted\" these \"simple elements.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10. Examples of glyph elision, showing elimination of\r\nall parts except essential element (here, the crossed bands).]\r\n\r\nMoreover, there is encountered at the very outset in the study of these\r\nelements a condition which renders progress slow and results uncertain. In\r\nEgyptian texts of any given period the simple phonetic elements or signs\r\nare unchanging under all conditions of composition. Like the letters of our\r\nown alphabet, they never vary and may be recognized as unfailingly. On the\r\nother hand, in Maya texts each glyph is in itself a finished picture,\r\ndependent on no other for its meaning, and consequently the various\r\nelements entering into it undergo very considerable modifications in order\r\nthat the resulting composite character may not only be a balanced and\r\nharmonious {24} design, but also may exactly fill its allotted space. All\r\nsuch modifications probably in no way affect the meaning of the element\r\nthus mutilated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11. Normal-form and head-variant glyphs, showing\r\nretention of essential element in each.]\r\n\r\nThe element shown in figure 10, _a-e_ is a case in point. In _a_ and _b_ we\r\nhave what may be called the normal or regular forms of this element. In\r\n_c_, however, the upper arm has been omitted for the sake of symmetry in a\r\ncomposite glyph, while in _d_ the lower arm has been left out for want of\r\nspace. Finally in _e_ both arms have disappeared and the element is reduced\r\nto the sign (), which we may conclude, therefore, is the essential\r\ncharacteristic of this glyph, particularly since there is no regularity in\r\nthe treatment of the arms in the normal forms. This suggests another point\r\nof the utmost importance, namely, the determination of the essential\r\nelements of Maya glyphs. The importance of this point lies in the fact that\r\ngreat license was permitted in the treatment of accessory elements so long\r\nas the essential element or elements of a glyph could readily be recognized\r\nas such. In this way may be explained the use of the so-called \"head\"\r\nvariants, in which the outline of the glyph was represented as a human or a\r\ngrotesque head modified in some way by the essential element of the\r\nintended form. The first step in the development of head variants is seen\r\nin figure 11, _a_, _b_, in which the entire glyph _a_ is used as a\r\nheaddress in glyph _b_, the meaning of the two forms remaining identical.\r\nThe next step is shown in the same figure, _c_ and _d_, in which the\r\noutline of the entire glyph _c_ has been changed to form the grotesque head\r\n_d_, though in both glyphs the essential elements are the same. A further\r\ndevelopment was to apply the essential element () of _e_ to the head in\r\n_f_, giving rise to a head variant, the meaning of which suffered no\r\ncorresponding change. The element (+) in figure 11, _g_, has been reduced\r\nin size in _h_, though the other two essential elements remain unchanged. A\r\nfinal step appears in _i_ and _j_, where in _j_ the position of one of the\r\ntwo essential elements of _i_ () and the form of the other (++) have been\r\nchanged. These variants {25} are puzzling enough when the essential\r\ncharacteristics and meaning of a glyph have been determined, but when both\r\nare unknown the problem is indeed knotty. For example, it would seem as a\r\nlogical deduction from the foregoing examples, that _l_ of figure 11 is a\r\n\"head\" variant of _k_; and similarly _n_ might be a \"head\" variant of _m_,\r\nbut here we are treading on uncertain ground, as the meanings of these\r\nforms are unknown.\r\n\r\nNor is this feature of Maya writing (i. e., the presence of \"head\r\nvariants\") the only pitfall which awaits the beginner who attempts to\r\nclassify the glyphs according to their appearance. In some cases two\r\nentirely dissimilar forms express exactly the same idea. For example, no\r\ntwo glyphs could differ more in appearance than _a_ and _b_, figure 12, yet\r\nboth of these forms have the same meaning. This is true also of the two\r\nglyphs _c_ and _d_, and _e_ and _f_. The occurrence of forms so absolutely\r\nunlike in appearance, yet identical in meaning, greatly complicates the\r\nproblem of glyph identification. Indeed, identity in both meaning and use\r\nmust be clearly established before we can recognize as variants of the same\r\nglyph, forms so dissimilar as the examples above given. Hence, because\r\ntheir meanings are unknown we are unable to identify _g_ and _h_, figure\r\n12, as synonyms, notwithstanding the fact that their use seems to be\r\nidentical, _h_ occurring in two or three texts under exactly the same\r\nconditions as does _g_ in all the others.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12. Normal-form and head-variant glyphs, showing\r\nabsence of common essential element.]\r\n\r\nA further source of error in glyph identification is the failure to\r\nrecognize variations due merely to individual peculiarities of style, which\r\nare consequently unessential. Just as handwriting differs in each\r\nindividual, so the delineation of glyphs differed among the ancient Maya,\r\nthough doubtless to a lesser extent. In extreme cases, however, the\r\ndifferences are so great that identification of variants as forms of one\r\nand the same glyph is difficult if indeed not impossible. Here also are to\r\nbe included variations due to differences in the materials upon which the\r\nglyphs are delineated, as well as those arising from careless drawing and\r\nactual mistakes.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing difficulties, as well as others which await the student who\r\nwould classify the Maya glyphs according to form and appearance, have led\r\nthe author to discard this method of classification as unsuited to the\r\npurposes of an elementary work. Though a problem of first importance, the\r\nanalysis of the simple elements is far too complex for presentation to the\r\nbeginner, particularly since the {26} greatest diversity of opinion\r\nconcerning them prevails among those who have studied the subject, scarcely\r\nany two agreeing at any one point; and finally because up to the present\r\ntime success in reading Maya writing has not come through this channel.\r\n\r\nThe classification followed herein is based on the general meaning of the\r\nglyphs, and therefore has the advantage of being at least self-explanatory.\r\nIt divides the glyphs into two groups: (1) Astronomical, calendary, and\r\nnumerical signs, that is, glyphs used in counting time; and (2) glyphs\r\naccompanying the preceding, which have an explanatory function of some\r\nsort, probably describing the nature of the occasions which the first group\r\nof glyphs designate.\r\n\r\nAccording to this classification, the great majority of the glyphs whose\r\nmeanings have been determined fall into the first group, and those whose\r\nmeanings are still unknown into the second. This is particularly true of\r\nthe inscriptions, in which the known glyphs practically all belong to the\r\nfirst group. In the codices, on the other hand, some little progress has\r\nmade been in reading glyphs of the second group. The name-glyphs of the\r\nprincipal gods, the signs for the cardinal points and associated colors,\r\nand perhaps a very few others may be mentioned in this connection.[18]\r\n\r\nOf the unknown glyphs in both the inscriptions and the codices, a part at\r\nleast have to do with numerical calculations of some kind, a fact which\r\nrelegates such glyphs to the first group. The author believes that as the\r\nreading of the Maya glyphs progresses, more and more characters will be\r\nassigned to the first group and fewer and fewer to the second. In the end,\r\nhowever, there will be left what we may perhaps call a \"textual residue,\"\r\nthat is, those glyphs which explain the nature of the events that are to be\r\nassociated with the corresponding chronological parts. It is here, if\r\nanywhere, that fragments of Maya history will be found recorded, and\r\nprecisely here is the richest field for future research, since the\r\nsuccessful interpretation of this \"textual residue\" will alone disclose the\r\ntrue meaning of the Maya writings.\r\n\r\nThree principal theories have been advanced for the interpretation of Maya\r\nwriting:\r\n\r\n1. That the glyphs are phonetic, each representing some sound, and entirely\r\ndissociated from the representation of any thought or idea.\r\n\r\n2. That the glyphs are ideographic, each representing in itself some\r\ncomplete thought or idea.\r\n\r\n3. That the glyphs are both phonetic and ideographic, that is, a\r\ncombination of 1 and 2.\r\n\r\nIt is apparent at the outset that the first of these theories can not be\r\naccepted in its entirety; for although there are undeniable traces {27} of\r\nphoneticism among the Maya glyphs, all attempts to reduce them to a\r\nphonetic system or alphabet, which will interpret the writing, have\r\nsignally failed. The first and most noteworthy of these so-called \"Maya\r\nalphabets,\" because of its genuine antiquity, is that given by Bishop Landa\r\nin his invaluable _Relacion de las cosas de Yucatan_, frequently cited in\r\nChapter I. Writing in the year 1565, within 25 years of the Spanish\r\nConquest, Landa was able to obtain characters for 27 sounds, as follows:\r\nThree _a's_, two _b's_, _c_, _t_, _e_, _h_, _i_, _ca_, _k_, two _l's_, _m_,\r\n_n_, two _o's_, _pp_, _p_, _cu_, _ku_, two _x's_, two _v's_, _z_. This\r\nalphabet, which was first published in 1864 by Abbé Brasseur de Bourbourg\r\n(see Landa, 1864), was at once heralded by Americanists as the long-awaited\r\nkey which would unlock the secrets of the Maya writing. Unfortunately these\r\nconfident expectations have not been realized, and all attempts to read the\r\nglyphs by means of this alphabet or of any of the numerous others[19] which\r\nhave appeared since, have completely broken down.\r\n\r\nThis failure to establish the exclusive phonetic character of the Maya\r\nglyphs has resulted in the general acceptance of the second theory, that\r\nthe signs are ideographic. Doctor Brinton (1894b: p. 14), however, has\r\npointed out two facts deducible from the Landa alphabet which render\r\nimpossible not only the complete acceptance of this second theory but also\r\nthe absolute rejection of the first: (1) That a native writer was able to\r\ngive a written character for an unfamiliar sound, a sound, moreover, which\r\nwas without meaning to him, as, for example, that of a Spanish letter; and\r\n(2) that the characters he employed for this purpose were also used in the\r\nnative writings. These facts Doctor Brinton regards as proof that some sort\r\nof phonetic writing was not unknown, and, indeed, both the inscriptions and\r\nthe codices establish the truth of this contention. For example, the sign\r\nin _a_, figure 13, has the phonetic value _kin_, and the sign in _b_ the\r\nphonetic value _yax_. In the latter glyph, however, only the upper part\r\n(reproduced in _c_) is to be regarded as the essential element. It is\r\nstrongly indicative of phoneticism therefore to find the sound _yaxkin_, a\r\ncombination of these two, expressed by the sign found in d. Similarly, the\r\ncharacter representing the phonetic value _kin_ is found also as an element\r\nin the glyphs for the words _likin_ {28} and _chikin_ (see _e_ and _f_,\r\nrespectively, fig. 13), each of which has _kin_ as its last syllable.\r\nAgain, the phonetic value _tun_ is expressed by the glyph in _g_, and the\r\nsound _ca_ (_c_ hard) by the sign _h_. The sound _katun_ is represented by\r\nthe character in _i_, a combination of these two. Sometimes the glyph for\r\nthis same sound takes the form of _j_, the fish element in _k_ replacing\r\nthe comblike element _h_. Far from destroying the phonetic character of\r\nthis composite glyph, however, this variant _k_ in reality strengthens it,\r\nsince in Maya the word for fish is _cay_ (_c_ hard) and consequently the\r\nvariant reads _caytun_, a close phonetic approximation of _katun_. The\r\nremaining element of this glyph (_l_) has the value _cauac_, the first\r\nsyllable of which is also expressed by either _h_ or _k_, figure 13. Its\r\nuse in _i_ and _j_ probably may be regarded as but a further emphasis of\r\nthe phonetic character of the glyph.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered, however, that all of the above glyphs have meanings\r\nquite independent of their phonetic values, that primarily their function\r\nwas to convey ideas, and that only secondarily were they used in their\r\nphonetic senses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13. Glyphs built up on a phonetic basis.]\r\n\r\nIf neither the phonetic nor the ideographic character of the glyphs can be\r\nwholly admitted, what then is the true nature of the Maya writing? The\r\ntheory now most generally accepted is, that while chiefly ideographic, the\r\nglyphs are sometimes phonetic, and that although the idea of a glyphic\r\nalphabet must finally be abandoned, the phonetic use of syllables as\r\nillustrated above must as surely be recognized.\r\n\r\nThis kind of writing Doctor Brinton has called _ikonomatic_, more\r\nfamiliarly known to us under the name of rebus, or puzzle writing. In such\r\nwriting the characters do not indicate the ideas of the objects which they\r\nportray, but only the sounds of their names, and are used purely in a\r\nphonetic sense, like the letters of the alphabet. For example, the rebus in\r\nfigure 14 reads as follows: \"I believe Aunt Rose can well bear all for\r\nyou.\" The picture of the eye recalls not the idea \"eye\" but the sound of\r\nthe word denoting this object, which is also the sound of the word for the\r\nfirst person singular of the {29} personal pronoun I. Again, the picture of\r\na bee does not represent the idea of that insect, but stands for the sound\r\nof its name, which used with a leaf indicates the sound \"beeleaf,\" or in\r\nother words, \"believe.\"[20]\r\n\r\nIt has long been known that the Aztec employed ikonomatic characters in\r\ntheir writing to express the names of persons and places, though this\r\npractice does not seem to have been extended by them to the representation\r\nof abstract words. The Aztec codices contain many glyphs which are to be\r\ninterpreted ikonomatically, that is, like our own rebus writing. For\r\nexample in figure 15, _a_, is shown the Aztec hieroglyph for the town of\r\nToltitlan, a name which means \"near the place of the rushes.\" The word\r\n_tollin_ means \"place of the rushes,\" but only its first syllable _tol_\r\nappears in the word Toltitlan. This syllable is represented in _a_ by\r\nseveral rushes. The word _tetlan_ means \"near something\" and its second\r\nsyllable _tlan_ is found also in the word _tlantli_, meaning \"teeth.\" In\r\n_a_ therefore, the addition of the teeth to the rushes gives the word\r\nToltitlan. Another example of this kind of writing is given in figure 15,\r\n_b_, where the hieroglyph for the town of Acatzinco is shown. This word\r\nmeans \"the little reed grass,\" the diminutive being represented by the\r\nsyllable _tzinco_. The reed grass (_acatl_) is shown by the pointed leaves\r\nor spears which emerge from the lower part of a human figure. This part of\r\nthe body was called by the Aztecs _tzinco_, and as used here expresses\r\nmerely the sound _tzinco_ in the diminutive _acatzinco_, \"the little reed\r\ngrass,\" the letter _l_ of _acatl_ being lost in composition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14. A rebus. Aztec, and probably Maya, personal and\r\nplace names were written in a corresponding manner.]\r\n\r\nThe presence of undoubted phonetic elements in these Aztec glyphs\r\nexpressing personal names and place names would seem to indicate that some\r\nsimilar usage probably prevailed among the Maya. {30} While admitting this\r\nrestricted use of phonetic composition by the Maya, Professor Seler refuses\r\nto recognize its further extension:\r\n\r\n    Certainly there existed in the Maya writing compound hieroglyphs giving\r\n    the name of a deity, person, or a locality, whose elements united on\r\n    the phonetic principle. But as yet it is not proved that they wrote\r\n    texts. And without doubt the greater part of the Maya hieroglyphics\r\n    were conventional symbols built up on the ideographic principle.\r\n\r\nDoctor Förstemann also regards the use of phonetic elements as restricted\r\nto little more than the above when he says, \"Finally the graphic system of\r\nthe Maya ... never even achieved the expression of a phrase or even a\r\nverb.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Mr. Bowditch (1910: p. 255) considers the use of\r\nphonetic composition extended considerably beyond these limits:\r\n\r\n    As far as I am aware, the use of this kind of writing [rebus] was\r\n    confined, among the Aztecs, to the names of persons and places, while\r\n    the Mayas, if they used the rebus form at all, used it also for\r\n    expressing common nouns and possibly abstract ideas. The Mayas surely\r\n    used picture writing and the ideographic system, but I feel confident\r\n    that a large part of their hieroglyphs will be found to be made up of\r\n    rebus forms and that the true line of research will be found to lie in\r\n    this direction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15. Aztec place names: _a_, The sign for the town\r\nToltitlan; _b_, the sign for the town Acatzinco.]\r\n\r\nDoctor Brinton (1894 b: p. 13) held an opinion between these two, perhaps\r\ninclining slightly toward the former: \"The intermediate position which I\r\nhave defended, is that while chiefly ideographic, they [the Maya glyphs]\r\nare occasionally phonetic, in the same manner as are confessedly the Aztec\r\npicture-writings.\"\r\n\r\nThese quotations from the most eminent authorities on the subject well\r\nillustrate their points of agreement and divergence. All admit the\r\nexistence of phonetic elements in the glyphs, but disagree as to their\r\nextent. And here, indeed, is the crux of the whole phonetic question. Just\r\nhow extensively do phonetic elements enter into the composition of the Maya\r\nglyphs? Without attempting to dispose of this point definitely one way or\r\nthe other, the author may say that he believes that as the decipherment of\r\nMaya writing progresses, more and more phonetic elements will be\r\nidentified, though the idea conveyed by a glyph will always be found to\r\novershadow its phonetic value.\r\n\r\nThe various theories above described have not been presented for the\r\nreader's extended consideration, but only in order to acquaint him with the\r\nprobable nature of the Maya glyphs. Success in deciphering, as we shall\r\nsee, has not come through any of the above mentioned lines of research,\r\nwhich will not be pursued further in this work. {31}\r\n\r\nIn taking up the question of the meaning of Maya writing, it must be\r\nadmitted at the outset that in so far as they have been deciphered both the\r\ninscriptions and the codices have been found to deal primarily, if indeed\r\nnot exclusively, with the counting of time in some form or other. Doctor\r\nFörstemann, the first successful interpreter of the codices, has shown that\r\nthese writings have for their principal theme the passage of time in its\r\nvarying relations to the Maya calendar, ritual, and astronomy. They deal in\r\ngreat part with the sacred year of 260 days, known to the Aztec also under\r\nthe name of the _tonalamatl_, in connection with which various ceremonies,\r\nofferings, sacrifices, and domestic occupations are set forth. Doctor\r\nFörstemann believed that this 260-day period was employed by the priests in\r\ncasting horoscopes and foretelling the future of individuals, classes, and\r\ntribes, as well as in predicting coming political events and natural\r\nphenomena; or in other words, that in so far as the 260-day period was\r\nconcerned, the codices are nothing more nor less than books of prophecy and\r\ndivination.\r\n\r\nThe prophetic character of some of these native books at least is clearly\r\nindicated in a passage from Bishop Landa's _Relacion_ (p. 286). In\r\ndescribing a festival held in the month Uo, the Bishop relates that \"the\r\nmost learned priest opened a book, in which he examined the omens of the\r\nyear, which he announced to all those who were present.\" Other early\r\nSpanish writers state that these books contain the ancient prophecies and\r\nindicate the times appointed for their fulfillment.\r\n\r\nDoctor Thomas regarded the codices as religious calendars, or rituals for\r\nthe guidance of the priests in the celebration of feasts, ceremonies, and\r\nother duties, seemingly a natural inference from the character of the\r\nscenes portrayed in connection with these 260-day periods.\r\n\r\nAnother very important function of the codices is the presentation of\r\nastronomical phenomena and calculations. The latter had for their immediate\r\nobject in each case the determination of the lowest number which would\r\nexactly contain all the numbers of a certain group. These lowest numbers\r\nare in fact nothing more nor less than the least common multiple of\r\nchanging combinations of numbers, each one of which represents the\r\nrevolution of some heavenly body. In addition to these calculations deities\r\nare assigned to the several periods, and a host of mythological allusions\r\nare introduced, the significance of most of which is now lost.\r\n\r\nThe most striking proof of the astronomical character of the codices is to\r\nbe seen in pages 46-50 of the Dresden Manuscript. Here, to begin with, a\r\nperiod of 2,920 days is represented, which exactly contains five Venus\r\nyears of 584[21] days each (one on each page) as well as eight solar years\r\nof 365 days each. Each of the Venus years is divided into four parts,\r\nrespectively, 236, 90, 250, and 8 days. The {32} first and third of these\r\nconstitute the periods when Venus was the morning and the evening star,\r\nrespectively, and the second and fourth, the periods of invisibility after\r\neach of these manifestations. This Venus-solar period of 2,920 days was\r\ntaken as the basis from which the number 37,960 was formed. This contains\r\n13 Venus-solar periods, 65 Venus-years, 104 solar years, and 146\r\n_tonalamatls_, or sacred years of 260 days each. Finally, the last number\r\n(37,960) with all the subdivisions above given was thrice repeated, so that\r\nthese five pages of the manuscript record the passage of 113,880 days, or\r\n312 solar years.\r\n\r\nAgain, on pages 51-58 of the same manuscript, 405 revolutions of the moon\r\nare set down; and so accurate are the calculations involved that although\r\nthey cover a period of nearly 33 years the total number of days recorded\r\n(11,959) is only 89/100 of a day less than the true time computed by the\r\nbest modern method[22]--certainly a remarkable achievement for the\r\naboriginal mind. It is probable that the revolutions of the planets\r\nJupiter, Mars, Mercury, and Saturn are similarly recorded in the same\r\nmanuscript.\r\n\r\nToward the end of the Dresden Codex the numbers become greater and greater\r\nuntil, in the so-called \"serpent numbers,\" a grand total of nearly twelve\r\nand a half million days (about thirty-four thousand years) is recorded\r\nagain and again. In these well-nigh inconceivable periods all the smaller\r\nunits may be regarded as coming at last to a more or less exact close. What\r\nmatter a few score years one way or the other in this virtual eternity?\r\nFinally, on the last page of the manuscript, is depicted the Destruction of\r\nthe World (see pl. 3), for which these highest numbers have paved the way.\r\nHere we see the rain serpent, stretching across the sky, belching forth\r\ntorrents of water. Great streams of water gush from the sun and moon. The\r\nold goddess, she of the tiger claws and forbidding aspect, the malevolent\r\npatroness of floods and cloudbursts, overturns the bowl of the heavenly\r\nwaters. The crossbones, dread emblem of death, decorate her skirt, and a\r\nwrithing snake crowns her head. Below with downward-pointed spears,\r\nsymbolic of the universal destruction, the black god stalks abroad, a\r\nscreeching bird raging on his fearsome head. Here, indeed, is portrayed\r\nwith graphic touch the final all-engulfing cataclysm.\r\n\r\nAccording to the early writers, in addition to the astronomic, prophetic,\r\nand ritualistic material above described, the codices contained records of\r\nhistorical events. It is doubtful whether this is true of any of the three\r\ncodices now extant, though there are grounds for believing that the Codex\r\nPeresianus may be in part at least of an historical nature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PAGE 74 OF THE DRESDEN CODEX, SHOWING THE END OF THE\r\nWORLD (ACCORDING TO FÖRSTEMANN)]\r\n\r\n{33}\r\n\r\nMuch less progress has been made toward discovering the meaning of the\r\ninscriptions. Doctor Brinton (1894 b: p.32) states:\r\n\r\n    My own conviction is that they [the inscriptions and codices] will\r\n    prove to be much more astronomical than even the latter [Doctor\r\n    Förstemann] believes; that they are primarily and essentially records\r\n    of the motions of the heavenly bodies; and that both figures and\r\n    characters are to be interpreted as referring in the first instance to\r\n    the sun and moon, the planets, and those constellations which are most\r\n    prominent in the nightly sky in the latitude of Yucatan.\r\n\r\nMr. Bowditch (1910: p. 199) has also brought forward very cogent points\r\ntending to show that in part at least the inscriptions treat of the\r\nintercalation of days necessary to bring the dated monuments, based on a\r\n365-day year, into harmony with the true solar year of 365.2421 days.[23]\r\n\r\nWhile admitting that the inscriptions may, and probably do, contain such\r\nastronomical matter as Doctor Brinton and Mr. Bowditch have suggested, the\r\nwriter believes nevertheless that fundamentally they are historical; that\r\nthe monuments upon which they are presented were erected and inscribed on\r\nor about the dates they severally record; and finally, that the great\r\nmajority of these dates are those of contemporaneous events, and as such\r\npertain to the subject-matter of history.\r\n\r\nThe reasons which have led him to this conclusion follow:\r\n\r\n_First._ The monuments at most of the southern Maya sites show a certain\r\nperiodicity in their sequence. This is most pronounced at Quirigua, where\r\nall of the large monuments fall into an orderly series, in which each\r\nmonument is dated exactly 1,800 days later than the one immediately\r\npreceding it in the sequence. This is also true at Copan, where, in spite\r\nof the fact that there are many gaps in the sequence, enough monuments\r\nconforming to the plan remain to prove its former existence. The same may\r\nbe said also of Naranjo, Seibal, and Piedras Negras, and in fact of almost\r\nall the other large cities which afford sufficient material for a\r\nchronological arrangement.\r\n\r\nThis interval of 1,800 days quite obviously was not determined by the\r\nrecurrence of any natural phenomenon. It has no parallel in nature, but is,\r\non the contrary, a highly artificial unit. Consequently, monuments the\r\nerection of which was regulated by the successive returns of this period\r\ncould not depend in the least for the fact of their existence on any\r\nastronomical phenomenon other than that of the rising and setting of\r\neighteen hundred successive suns, an arbitrary period.\r\n\r\nThe Maya of Yucatan had a similar method of marking time, though their unit\r\nof enumeration was 7,200 days, or four times the {34} length of the one\r\nused for the same purpose in the older cities. The following quotations\r\nfrom early Spanish chroniclers explain this practice and indicate that the\r\ninscriptions presented on these time-markers were of an historical nature:\r\n\r\n    There were discovered in the plaza of that city [Mayapan] seven or\r\n    eight stones each ten feet in length, round at the end, and well\r\n    worked. These had some writings in the characters which they use, but\r\n    were so worn by water that they could not be read. Moreover, they think\r\n    them to be in memory of the foundation and destruction of that city.\r\n    There are other similar ones, although higher, at Zilan, one of the\r\n    coast towns. The natives when asked what these things were, replied\r\n    that they were accustomed to erect one of these stones every twenty\r\n    years, which is the number they use for counting their ages.[24]\r\n\r\nThe other is even more explicit:\r\n\r\n    Their lustras having reached five in number, which made twenty years,\r\n    which they call a katun, they place a graven stone on another of the\r\n    same kind laid in lime and sand in the walls of their temples and the\r\n    houses of the priests, as one still sees to-day in the edifices in\r\n    question, and in some ancient walls of our own convent at Merida, about\r\n    which there are some cells. In a city named Tixhualatun, which\r\n    signifies \"place where one graven stone is placed upon another,\" they\r\n    say are their archives, where everybody had recourse for events of all\r\n    kinds, as we do to Simancas.[25]\r\n\r\nIt seems almost necessary to conclude from such a parallel that the\r\ninscriptions of the southern cities will also be found to treat of\r\nhistorical matters.\r\n\r\n_Second._ When the monuments of the southern cities are arranged according\r\nto their art development, that is, in stylistic sequence, they are found to\r\nbe arranged in their chronological order as well. This important discovery,\r\ndue largely to the researches of Dr. H. J. Spinden, has enabled us to\r\ndetermine the relative ages of various monuments quite independent of their\r\nrespective dates. From a stylistic consideration alone it has been possible\r\nnot only to show that the monuments date from different periods, but also\r\nto establish the sequence of these periods and that of the monuments in\r\nthem. Finally, it has demonstrated beyond all doubt that the great majority\r\nof the dates on Maya monuments refer to the time of their erection, so that\r\nthe inscriptions which they present are historical in that they are the\r\ncontemporaneous records of different epochs.\r\n\r\n_Third._ The dates on the monuments are such as to constitute a strong\r\nantecedent probability of their historical character. Like the records of\r\nmost ancient peoples, the Maya monuments, judging from their dates, were at\r\nfirst scattered and few. Later, as new cities were founded and the nation\r\nwaxed stronger and stronger, the number of monuments increased, until at\r\nthe flood tide of Maya prosperity they were, comparatively speaking,\r\ncommon. Finally, as decline set in, fewer and fewer monuments were erected,\r\nand eventually effort in this field ceased altogether. The increasing\r\nnumber of the monuments by ten-year periods is shown in plate 4, where the\r\npassage of time (i. e., the successive ten-year periods) is represented\r\nfrom left to right, and the number of dates in each ten-year period from\r\nbottom to top. Although other dated monuments will be found from time to\r\ntime, which will necessarily change the details given in this diagram, such\r\nadditional evidence in all probability will never controvert the following\r\ngeneral conclusions, embodied in what has just been stated, which are\r\ndeducible from it:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM SHOWING OCCURRENCE OF DATES RECORDED IN CYCLE 9]\r\n\r\n{35}\r\n\r\n1. At first there was a long period of slow growth represented by few\r\nmonuments, which, however, increased in number toward the end.\r\n\r\n2. This was followed without interruption by a period of increased\r\nactivity, the period from which the great majority of the monuments date.\r\n\r\n3. Finally this period came to rather an abrupt end, indicated by the\r\nsudden cessation in the erection of dated monuments.\r\n\r\nThe consideration of these indisputable facts tends to establish the\r\nhistorical rather than the astronomical character of the monuments. For had\r\nthe erection of the monuments depended on the successive recurrences of\r\nsome astronomical phenomenon, there would be corresponding intervals\r\nbetween the dates of such monuments[26] the length of which would indicate\r\nthe identity of the determining phenomenon; and they would hardly have\r\npresented the same logical increase due to the natural growth of a nation,\r\nwhich the accompanying diagram clearly sets forth.\r\n\r\n_Fourth._ Although no historical codices[27] are known to have survived,\r\nhistory was undoubtedly recorded in these ancient Maya books. The\r\nstatements of the early Spanish writers are very explicit on this point, as\r\nthe following quotations from their works will show. Bishop Landa (here, as\r\nalways, one of the most reliable authorities) says: \"And the sciences which\r\nthey [the priests] taught were the count of the years, months and days, the\r\nfeasts and ceremonies, the administration of their sacraments, days, and\r\nfatal times, their methods of divination and prophecy, and foretelling\r\nevents, and the remedies for the sick, and _their antiquities_\" [p. 44].\r\nAnd again, \"they [the priests] attended the service of the temples and to\r\nthe teaching of their sciences and _how to write them in their books_.\" And\r\nagain, [p. 316], \"This people also used certain characters or letters with\r\nwhich _they wrote in their books their ancient matters_ and sciences.\"\r\n\r\nFather Lizana says (see Landa, 1864: p. 352): \"The _history and authorities\r\nwe can cite_ are certain ancient characters, scarcely understood by many\r\nand explained by some old Indians, sons of the priests {36} of their gods,\r\nwho alone knew how to read and expound them and who were believed in and\r\nrevered as much as the gods themselves.\"\r\n\r\nFather Ponce (tome LVIII, p. 392) who visited Yucatan as early as 1588, is\r\nequally clear: \"The natives of Yucatan are among all the inhabitants of New\r\nSpain especially deserving of praise for three things. First that before\r\nthe Spaniards came they made use of characters and letters with which _they\r\nwrote out their histories_, their ceremonies, the order of sacrifices to\r\ntheir idols and their calendars in books made of the bark of a certain\r\ntree.\"\r\n\r\nDoctor Aguilar, who wrote but little later (1596), gives more details as to\r\nthe kind of events which were recorded. \"On these [the fiber books] they\r\npainted in color the reckoning of their years, wars, pestilences,\r\nhurricanes, inundations, famines and other events.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, as late as 1697, some of these historical codices were in the\r\npossession of the last great independent Maya ruler, one Canek. Says\r\nVillagutierre (1701: lib. VI, cap. IV) in this connection: \"Because their\r\nking [Canek] had read it in his _analtehes_ [fiber-books or codices] they\r\nhad knowledge of the provinces of Yucatan, and of the fact that their\r\nancestors had formerly come from them; _analtehes_ or histories being one\r\nand the same thing.\"\r\n\r\nIt is clear from the foregoing extracts, that the Maya of Yucatan recorded\r\ntheir history up to the time of the Spanish Conquest, in their hieroglyphic\r\nbooks, or codices. That fact is beyond dispute. It must be remembered also\r\nin this connection, that the Maya of Yucatan were the direct inheritors of\r\nthat older Maya civilization in the south, which had produced the\r\nhieroglyphic monuments. For this latter reason the writer believes that the\r\npractice of recording history in the hieroglyphic writing had its origin,\r\nalong with many another custom, in the southern area, and consequently that\r\nthe inscriptions on the monuments of the southern cities are probably, in\r\npart at least, of an historical nature.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the meaning of the undeciphered glyphs, enough has been\r\nsaid in this chapter about those of known meaning to indicate the extreme\r\nimportance of the element of time in Maya writing. The very great\r\npreponderance of astronomical, calendary, and numerical signs in both the\r\ncodices and the inscriptions has determined, so far as the beginner is\r\nconcerned, the best way to approach the study of the glyphs. First, it is\r\nessential to understand thoroughly the Maya system of counting time, in\r\nother words, their calendar and chronology. Second, in order to make use of\r\nthis knowledge, as did the Maya, it is necessary to familiarize ourselves\r\nwith their arithmetic and its signs and symbols. Third, and last, after\r\nthis has been accomplished, we are ready to apply ourselves to the\r\ndeciphering of the inscriptions and the codices. For this reason the next\r\nchapter will be devoted to the discussion of the Maya system of counting\r\ntime. {37}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. HOW THE MAYA RECKONED TIME\r\n\r\nAmong all peoples and in all ages the most obvious unit for the measurement\r\nof time has been the day; and the never-failing reappearance of light after\r\neach interval of darkness has been the most constant natural phenomenon\r\nwith which the mind of man has had to deal. From the earliest times\r\nsuccessive returns of the sun have regulated the whole scheme of human\r\nexistence. When it was light, man worked; when it was dark, he rested.\r\nConformity to the operation of this natural law has been practically\r\nuniversal.\r\n\r\nIndeed, as primitive man saw nature, day was the only division of time upon\r\nwhich he could absolutely rely. The waxing and waning of the moon, with its\r\neverchanging shape and occasional obscuration by clouds, as well as its\r\nperiodic disappearances from the heavens all combined to render that\r\nluminary of little account in measuring the passage of time. The round of\r\nthe seasons was even more unsatisfactory. A late spring or an early winter\r\nby hastening or retarding the return of a season caused the apparent\r\nlengths of succeeding years to vary greatly. Even where a 365-day year had\r\nbeen determined, the fractional loss, amounting to a day every four years,\r\nsoon brought about a discrepancy between the calendar and the true year.\r\nThe day, therefore, as the most obvious period in nature, as well as the\r\nmost reliable, has been used the world over as the fundamental unit for the\r\nmeasurement of longer stretches of time.\r\n\r\nTABLE I. THE TWENTY MAYA DAY NAMES\r\n\r\n  Imix\r\n  Ik\r\n  Akbal\r\n  Kan\r\n  Chicchan\r\n  Cimi\r\n  Manik\r\n  Lamat\r\n  Muluc\r\n  Oc\r\n  Chuen\r\n  Eb\r\n  Ben\r\n  Ix\r\n  Men\r\n  Cib\r\n  Caban\r\n  Eznab\r\n  Cauac\r\n  Ahau\r\n\r\nIn conformity with the universal practice just mentioned the Maya made the\r\nday, which they called _kin_, the primary unit of their calendar. There\r\nwere twenty such units, named as in Table I; these followed each other in\r\nthe order there shown. When Ahau, the last day in the list, had been\r\nreached, the count began anew with Imix, and thus repeated itself again and\r\nagain without interruption, throughout time. It is important that the\r\nstudent should fix this {38} Maya conception of the rotation of days firmly\r\nin his mind at the outset, since all that is to follow depends upon the\r\nabsolute continuity of this twenty-day sequence in endless repetition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16. The day signs in the inscriptions.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17. The day signs in the codices.]\r\n\r\nThe glyphs for these twenty days are shown in figures 16 and 17. The forms\r\nin figure 16 are from the inscriptions and those in figure 17 from the\r\ncodices. In several cases variants are given to facilitate identification.\r\nA study of the glyphs in these two figures shows on the whole a fairly\r\nclose similarity between the forms for the same {39} day in each. The sign\r\nfor the first day, Imix, is practically identical in both. Compare figure\r\n16, _a_ and _b_, with figure 17, _a_ and b. The usual form for the day Ik\r\nin the inscriptions (see fig. 16, _c_), however, is unlike the glyph for\r\nthe same day in the codices (fig. 17, _c_, _d_). The forms for Akbal and\r\nKan are practically the same in each (see fig. 16, _d_, _e_, and _f_, and\r\nfig. 17, _e_ and _f_, respectively). The day Chicchan, figure 16, _g_,\r\noccurs rarely in the inscriptions; when present, it takes the {40} form of\r\na grotesque head. In the codices the common form for this day is very\r\ndifferent (fig. 17, _g_). The head variant, however (fig. 17, _h_), shows a\r\nslightly closer similarity to the form from the inscriptions. The forms in\r\nboth figure 16, _h_, _i_, and figure 17, _i_, _j_, for the day Cimi show\r\nlittle resemblance to each other. Although figure 17, _i_, represents the\r\ncommon form in the codices, the variant in _j_ more closely resembles the\r\nform in figure 16, _h_, _i_. The day Manik is practically the same in both\r\n(see figs. 16, _j_, and 17, _k_), as is also Lamat (figs. 16, _k_, _l_, and\r\n17, _l_, _m_). The day Muluc occurs rarely in the inscriptions (fig. 16,\r\n_m_, _n_). Of these two variants _m_ more closely resembles the form from\r\nthe codices (fig. 17, _n_). The glyph for the day Oc (fig. 16, _o_, _p_,\r\n_q_) is not often found in the inscriptions. In the codices, on the other\r\nhand, this day is frequently represented as shown in figure 17, _o_. This\r\nform bears no resemblance to the forms in the inscriptions. There is,\r\nhowever, a head-variant form found very rarely in the codices that bears a\r\nslight resemblance to the forms in the inscriptions. The day Chuen occurs\r\nbut once in the inscriptions where the form is clear enough to distinguish\r\nits characteristic (see fig. 16, _r_). This form bears a general\r\nresemblance to the glyph for this day in the codices (fig. 17, _p_, _q_).\r\nThe forms for the day Eb in both figures 16, _s_, _t_, _u_, and 17, _r_,\r\nare grotesque heads showing but remote resemblance to one another. The\r\nessential element in both, however, is the same, that is, the element\r\noccupying the position of the ear. Although the day Ben occurs but rarely\r\nin the inscriptions, its form (fig. 16, _v_) is practically identical with\r\nthat in the codices (see fig. 17, _s_). The day Ix in the inscriptions\r\nappears as in figure 16, _w_, _x_. The form in the codices is shown in\r\nfigure 17, _t_. The essential element in each seems to be the three\r\nprominent dots or circles. The day Men occurs very rarely on the monuments.\r\nThe form shown in figure 16, _y_, is a grotesque head not unlike the sign\r\nfor this day in the codices (fig. 17, _u_). The signs for the day Cib in\r\nthe inscriptions and the codices (figs. 16, _z_, and 17, _v_, _w_),\r\nrespectively, are very dissimilar. Indeed, the form for Cib (fig. 17, _v_)\r\nin the codices resembles more closely the sign for the day Caban (fig. 16,\r\n_a'_, _b'_) than it does the form for Cib in the inscriptions (see fig. 16,\r\n_z_). The only element common to both is the line paralleling the upper\r\npart of the glyph () and the short vertical lines connecting it with the\r\noutline at the top. The glyphs for the day Caban in both figures 16, _a'_,\r\n_b'_, and 17, _x_, _y_, show a satisfactory resemblance to each other. The\r\nforms for the day Eznab are also practically identical (see figs. 16, _c'_,\r\nand 17, _z_, _a'_). The forms for the day Cauac, on the other hand, are\r\nvery dissimilar; compare figures 16, _d'_, and 17, _b'_. The only point of\r\nresemblance between the two seems to be the element which appears in the\r\neye of the former and at the lower left-hand side of the latter. The last\r\nof the twenty Maya days, and by {41} far the most important, since it is\r\nfound in both the codices and the inscriptions more frequently than all of\r\nthe others combined, is Ahau (see figs. 16, _e'-k'_, and 17, _c'_, _d'_).\r\nThe latter form is the only one found in the codices, and is identical with\r\n_e'_, _f'_, figure 16, the usual sign for this day in the inscriptions. The\r\nvariants in figure 16, _g'-k_', appear on some of the monuments, and\r\nbecause of the great importance of this day Ahau it is necessary to keep\r\nall of them in mind.\r\n\r\nThese examples of the glyphs, which stand for the twenty Maya days, are in\r\neach case as typical as possible. The student must remember, however, that\r\nmany variations occur, which often render the correct identification of a\r\nform difficult. As explained in the preceding chapter, such variations are\r\ndue not only to individual peculiarities of style, careless drawing, and\r\nactual error, but also to the physical dissimilarities of materials on\r\nwhich they are portrayed, as the stone of the monuments and the fiber paper\r\nof the codices; consequently, such differences may be regarded as\r\nunessential. The ability to identify variants differing from those shown in\r\nfigures 16 and 17 will come only through experience and familiarity with\r\nthe glyphs themselves. The student should constantly bear in mind, however,\r\nthat almost every Maya glyph, the signs for the days included, has an\r\n_essential element_ peculiar to it, and the discovery of such elements will\r\ngreatly facilitate his study of Maya writing.\r\n\r\nWhy the named days should have been limited to twenty is difficult to\r\nunderstand, as this number has no parallel period in nature. Some have\r\nconjectured that this number was chosen because it represents the number of\r\nman's digits, the twenty fingers and toes. Mr. Bowditch has pointed out in\r\nthis connection that the Maya word for the period composed of these twenty\r\nnamed days is _uinal_, while the word for 'man' is _uinik_. The parallel is\r\ninteresting and may possibly explain why the number twenty was selected as\r\nthe basis of the Maya system of numeration, which, as we shall see later,\r\nwas vigesimal, that is, increasing by twenties or multiples thereof.\r\n\r\nTHE TONALAMATL, OR 260-DAY PERIOD\r\n\r\nMerely calling a day by one of the twenty names given in Table I, however,\r\ndid not sufficiently describe it according to the Maya notion. For\r\ninstance, there was no day in the Maya calendar called merely Imix, Ik, or\r\nAkbal, or, in fact, by any of the other names given in Table I. Before the\r\nname of a day was complete it was necessary to prefix to it a number\r\nranging from 1 to 13, inclusive, as 6 Imix or 13 Akbal. Then and only then\r\ndid a Maya day receive its complete designation and find its proper place\r\nin the calendar.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which these thirteen numbers, 1 to 13, inclusive, were joined\r\nto the twenty names of Table I was as follows: Selecting {42} any one of\r\nthe twenty names[28] as a starting point, Kan for example, the number 1 was\r\nprefixed to it. See Table II, in which the names of Table I have been\r\nrepeated with the numbers prefixed to them in a manner to be explained\r\nhereafter. The star opposite the name Kan indicates the starting point\r\nabove chosen. The name Chicchan immediately following Kan in Table II was\r\ngiven the next number in order (2), namely, 2 Chicchan. The next name,\r\nCimi, was given the next number (3), namely, 3 Cimi, and so on as follows:\r\n4 Manik, 5 Lamat, 6 Muluc, 7 Oc, 8 Chuen, 9 Eb, 10 Ben, 11 Ix, 12 Men, 13\r\nCib.\r\n\r\nTABLE II. SEQUENCE OF MAYA DAYS\r\n\r\n   5 Imix\r\n   6 Ik\r\n   7 Akbal\r\n  *1 Kan\r\n   2 Chicchan\r\n   3 Cimi\r\n   4 Manik\r\n   5 Lamat\r\n   6 Muluc\r\n   7 Oc\r\n   8 Chuen\r\n   9 Eb\r\n  10 Ben\r\n  11 Ix\r\n  12 Men\r\n  13 Cib\r\n   1 Caban\r\n   2 Eznab\r\n   3 Cauac\r\n   4 Ahau\r\n\r\nInstead of giving to the next name in Table II (Caban) the number 14, the\r\nnumber 1 was prefixed; for, as previously stated, the numerical\r\ncoefficients of the days did not rise above the number 13. Following the\r\nday 1 Caban, the sequence continued as before: 2 Eznab, 3 Cauac, 4 Ahau.\r\nAfter the day 4 Ahau, the last in Table II, the next number in order, in\r\nthis case 5, was prefixed to the next name in order--that is, Imix, the\r\nfirst name in Table II--and the count continued without interruption: 5\r\nImix, 6 Ik, 7 Akbal, or back to the name Kan with which it started. There\r\nwas no break in the sequence, however, even at this point (or at any other,\r\nfor that matter). The next name in Table II, Kan, selected for the starting\r\npoint, was given the number next in order, i. e., 8, and the day following\r\n7 Akbal in Table II would be, therefore, 8 Kan, and the sequence would\r\ncontinue to be formed in the same way: 8 Kan, 9 Chicchan, 10 Cimi, 11\r\nManik, 12 Lamat, 13 Muluc, 1 Oc, 2 Chuen, 3 Eb, and so on. So far as the\r\nMaya conception of time was concerned, this sequence of days went on\r\nwithout interruption, forever.\r\n\r\nWhile somewhat unusual at first sight, this sequence is in reality\r\nexceedingly simple, being governed by three easily remembered rules:\r\n\r\n_Rule 1._ The sequence of the 20 day names repeats itself again and again\r\nwithout interruption.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TONALAMATL WHEEL, SHOWING SEQUENCE OF THE 260\r\nDIFFERENTLY NAMED DAYS]\r\n\r\n{43}\r\n\r\n_Rule 2._ The sequence of the numerical coefficients 1 to 13, inclusive,\r\nrepeats itself again and again without interruption, 1 following\r\nimmediately 13.\r\n\r\n_Rule 3._ The 13 numerical coefficients are attached to the 20 names, so\r\nthat after a start has been made by prefixing any one of the 13 numbers to\r\nany one of the 20 names, the number next in order is given to the name next\r\nin order, and the sequence continues indefinitely in this manner.\r\n\r\nIt is a simple question of arithmetic to determine the number of days which\r\nmust elapse before a day bearing the same designation as a previous one in\r\nthe sequence can reappear. Since there are 13 numbers and 20 names, and\r\nsince each of the 13 numbers must be attached in turn to each one of the 20\r\nnames before a given number can return to a given name, we must find the\r\nleast common multiple of 13 and 20. As these two numbers, contain no common\r\nfactor, their least common multiple is their product (260), which is the\r\nnumber sought. Therefore, any given day can not reappear in the sequence\r\nuntil after the 259 days immediately following it shall have elapsed. Or,\r\nin other words, the 261st day will have the same designation as the 1st,\r\nthe 262d the same as the 2d, and so on.\r\n\r\nThis is graphically shown in the wheel figured in plate 5, where the\r\nsequence of the days, commencing with 1 Imix, which is indicated by a star,\r\nis represented as extending around the rim of the wheel. After the name of\r\neach day, its number in the sequence beginning with the starting point 1\r\nImix, is shown in parenthesis. Now, if the star opposite the day 1 Imix be\r\nconceived to be stationary and the wheel to revolve in a sinistral circuit,\r\nthat is contra-clockwise, the days will pass the star in the order which\r\nthey occupy in the 260-day sequence. It appears from this diagram also that\r\nthe day 1 Imix can not recur until after 260 days shall have passed, and\r\nthat it always follows the day 13 Ahau. This must be true since _Ahau_ is\r\nthe name immediately preceding Imix in the sequence of the day names and 13\r\nis the number immediately preceding 1. After the day 13 Ahau (the 260th\r\nfrom the starting point) is reached, the day 1 Imix, the 261st, recurs and\r\nthe sequence, having entered into itself again, begins anew as before.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18. Sign for the tonalamatl (according to Goodman).]\r\n\r\nThis round of the 260 differently named days was called by the Aztec the\r\n_tonalamatl_, or \"book of days.\" The Maya name for this period is\r\nunknown[29] and students have accepted the Aztec name for it. The\r\ntonalamatl is frequently represented in the Maya codices, there being more\r\nthan 200 examples in the Codex Tro-Cortesiano alone. It was a very useful\r\nperiod for the calculations of the priests because of the different sets of\r\nfactors into which it can be resolved, {44} namely, 4×65, 5×52, 10×26,\r\n13×20, and 2×130. Tonalamatls divided into 4, 5, and 10 equal parts of 65,\r\n52, and 26 days, respectively, occur repeatedly throughout the codices.\r\n\r\nIt is all the more curious, therefore, that this period is rarely\r\nrepresented in the inscriptions. The writer recalls but one city (Copan) in\r\nwhich this period is recorded to any considerable extent. It might almost\r\nbe inferred from this fact alone that the inscriptions do not treat of\r\nprophecy, divinations, or ritualistic and ceremonial matters, since these\r\nsubjects in the codices are always found in connection with tonalamatls. If\r\ntrue this considerably restricts the field of which the inscriptions may\r\ntreat.\r\n\r\nMr. Goodman has identified the glyph shown in figure 18 as the sign for the\r\n260-day period, but on wholly insufficient evidence the writer believes. On\r\nthe other hand, so important a period as the tonalamatl undoubtedly had its\r\nown particular glyph, but up to the present time all efforts to identify\r\nthis sign have proved unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nTHE HAAB, OR YEAR OF 365 DAYS\r\n\r\nHaving explained the composition and nature of the tonalamatl, or so-called\r\nSacred Year, let us turn to the consideration of the Solar Year, which was\r\nknown as _haab_ in the Maya language.\r\n\r\nThe Maya used in their calendar system a 365-day year, though they\r\ndoubtless knew that the true length of the year exceeds this by 6 hours.\r\nIndeed, Bishop Landa very explicitly states that such knowledge was current\r\namong them. \"They had,\" he says, \"their perfect year, like ours, of 365\r\ndays and 6 hours;\" and again, \"The entire year had 18 of these [20-day\r\nperiods] and besides 5 days and 6 hours.\" In spite of Landa's statements,\r\nhowever, it is equally clear that had the Maya attempted to take note of\r\nthese 6 additional hours by inserting an extra day in their calendar every\r\nfourth year, their day sequence would have been disturbed at once. An\r\nexamination of the tonalamatl, or round of days (see pl. 5), shows also\r\nthat the interpolation of a single day at any point would have thrown into\r\nconfusion the whole Maya calendar, not only interfering with the sequence\r\nbut also destroying its power of reentering itself at the end of 260 days.\r\nThe explanation of this statement is found in the fact that the Maya\r\ncalendar had no elastic period corresponding to our month of February,\r\nwhich is increased in length whenever the accumulation of fractional days\r\nnecessitates the addition of an extra day, in order to keep the calendar\r\nyear from gaining on the true year.\r\n\r\nIf the student can be made to realize that all Maya periods, from the\r\nlowest to the highest known, are always in a continuous sequence, {45} each\r\nreturning into itself and beginning anew after completion, he will have\r\ngrasped the most fundamental principle of Maya chronology--its absolute\r\ncontinuity throughout.\r\n\r\nIt may be taken for granted, therefore, in the discussion to follow that no\r\ninterpolation of intercalary days was actually made. It is equally\r\nprobable, however, that the priests, in whose hands such matters rested,\r\ncorrected the calendar by additional calculations which showed just how\r\nmany days the recorded year was ahead of the true year at any given time.\r\nMr. Bowditch (1910: Chap. XI) has cited several cases in which such\r\nadditional calculations exactly correct the inscriptions on the monument\r\nupon which they appear and bring their dates into harmony with the true\r\nsolar year.\r\n\r\nSo far as the calendar is concerned, then, the year consisted of but 365\r\ndays. It was divided into 18 periods of 20 days each, designated in Maya\r\n_uinal_, and a closing period of 5 days known as the _xma kaba kin_, or\r\n\"days without name.\" The sum of these (18×20+5) exactly made up the\r\ncalendar year.\r\n\r\nTABLE III. THE DIVISIONS OP THE MAYA YEAR\r\n\r\n  Pop\r\n  Uo\r\n  Zip\r\n  Zotz\r\n  Tzec\r\n  Xul\r\n  Yaxkin\r\n  Mol\r\n  Chen\r\n  Yax\r\n  Zac\r\n  Ceh\r\n  Mac\r\n  Kankin\r\n  Muan\r\n  Pax\r\n  Kayab\r\n  Cumhu\r\n  Uayeb\r\n\r\nThe names of these 19 divisions of the year are given in Table III in the\r\norder in which they follow one another; the twentieth day of one month was\r\nsucceeded by the first day of the next month.\r\n\r\nThe first day of the Maya year was the first day of the month Pop, which,\r\naccording to the early Spanish authorities, Bishop Landa (1864: p. 276)\r\nincluded, always fell on the 16th of July.[30] Uayeb, the last division of\r\nthe year, contained only 5 days, the last day of Uayeb being at the same\r\ntime the 365th day of the year. Consequently, when this day was completed,\r\nthe next in order was the Maya New Year's Day, the first day of the month\r\nPop, after which the sequence repeated itself as before.\r\n\r\nThe xma kaba kin, or \"days without name,\" were regarded as especially\r\nunlucky and ill-omened. Says Pio Perez (see Landa, 1864: p. 384) in\r\nspeaking of these closing days of the year: \"Some call them _u yail kin_ or\r\n_u yail haab_, which may be translated, the sorrowful and laborious days or\r\npart of the year; for they [the Maya] {46} believed that in them occurred\r\nsudden deaths and pestilences, and that they were diseased by poisonous\r\nanimals, or devoured by wild beasts, fearing that if they went out to the\r\nfield to their labors, some tree would pierce them or some other kind of\r\nmisfortune happen to them.\" The Aztec held the five closing days of the\r\nyear in the same superstitious dread. Persons born in this unlucky period\r\nwere held to be destined by this fact to wretchedness and poverty for life.\r\nThese days were, moreover, prophetic in character; what occurred during\r\nthem continued to happen ever afterward. Hence, quarreling was avoided\r\nduring this period lest it should never cease.\r\n\r\nHaving learned the number, length, and names of the several periods into\r\nwhich the Maya divided their year, and the sequence in which these followed\r\none another, the next subject which claims attention is the positions of\r\nthe several days in these periods. In order properly to present this\r\nimportant subject, it is first necessary to consider briefly how we count\r\nand number our own units of time, since through an understanding of these\r\npractices we shall better comprehend those of the ancient Maya.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that our methods of counting time are inconsistent with\r\neach other. For example, in describing the time of day, that is, in\r\ncounting hours, minutes, and seconds, we speak in terms of elapsed time.\r\nWhen we say it is 1 o'clock, in reality the first hour after noon, that is,\r\nthe hour between 12 noon and 1 p. m., has passed and the second hour after\r\nnoon is about to commence. When we say it is 2 o'clock, in reality the\r\nsecond hour after noon is finished and the third hour about to commence. In\r\nother words, we count the time of day by referring to passed periods and\r\nnot current periods. This is the method used in reckoning astronomical\r\ntime. During the passage of the first hour after midnight the hours are\r\nsaid to be zero, the time being counted by the number of minutes and\r\nseconds elapsed. Thus, half past 12 is written: 0^{hr.} 30^{min.} 0^{sec.},\r\nand quarter of 1, 0^{hr.} 45^{min.} 0^{sec.}. Indeed one hour can not be\r\nwritten until the first hour after midnight is completed, or until it is 1\r\no'clock, namely, 1^{hr.} 0^{min.} 0^{sec.}.\r\n\r\nWe use an entirely different method, however, in counting our days, years,\r\nand centuries, which are referred to as current periods of time. It is the\r\n1st day of January immediately after midnight December 31. It was the first\r\nyear of the Eleventh Century immediately after midnight December 31, 1000\r\nA. D. And finally, it was the Twentieth Century immediately after midnight\r\nDecember 31, 1900 A. D. In this category should be included also the days\r\nof the week and the months, since the names of these periods also refer to\r\npresent time. In other words when we speak of our days, months, years, and\r\ncenturies, we do not have in mind, and do not refer to completed periods of\r\ntime, but on the contrary to current periods. {47}\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that in the first method of counting time, in speaking of 1\r\no'clock, 1 hour, 30 minutes, we use only the cardinal forms of our numbers;\r\nbut in the second method we say the 1st of January, the Twentieth Century,\r\nusing the ordinal forms, though even here we permit ourselves one\r\ninconsistency. In speaking of our years, which are reckoned by the second\r\nmethod, we say \"nineteen hundred and twelve,\" when, to be consistent, we\r\nshould say \"nineteen hundred and twelfth,\" using the ordinal \"twelfth\"\r\ninstead of the cardinal \"twelve.\"\r\n\r\nWe may then summarize our methods of counting time as follows: (1) All\r\nperiods less than the day, as hours, minutes, and seconds, are referred to\r\nin terms of past time; and (2) the day and all greater periods are referred\r\nto in terms of current time.\r\n\r\nThe Maya seem to have used only the former of these two methods in counting\r\ntime; that is, all the different periods recorded in the codices and the\r\ninscriptions seemingly refer to elapsed time rather than to current time,\r\nto a day passed, rather than to a day present. Strange as this may appear\r\nto us, who speak of our calendar as current time, it is probably true\r\nnevertheless that the Maya, in so far as their writing is concerned, never\r\ndesignated a present day but always treated of a day gone by. The day\r\nrecorded is yesterday because to-day can not be considered an entity until,\r\nlike the hour of astronomical time, it completes itself and becomes a unit,\r\nthat is, a yesterday.\r\n\r\nThis is well illustrated by the Maya method of numbering the positions of\r\nthe days in the months, which, as we shall see, was identical with our own\r\nmethod of counting astronomical time. For example, the first day of the\r\nMaya month Pop was written Zero Pop, (0 Pop) for not until one whole day of\r\nPop had passed could the day 1 Pop be written; by that time, however, the\r\nfirst day of the month had passed and the second day commenced. In other\r\nwords, the second day of Pop was written 1 Pop; the third day, 2 Pop; the\r\nfourth day, 3 Pop; and so on through the 20 days of the Maya month. This\r\nmethod of numbering the positions of the days in the month led to calling\r\nthe last day of a month 19 instead of 20. This appears in Table IV, in\r\nwhich the last 6 days of one year and the first 22 of the next year are\r\nreferred to their corresponding positions in the divisions of the Maya\r\nyear. It must be remembered in using this Table that the closing period of\r\nthe Maya year, the xma kaba kin, or Uayeb, contained only 5 days, whereas\r\nall the other periods (the 18 uinals) had 20 days each.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough no glyph for the _haab_, or year, has been identified as\r\nyet, in spite of the apparent importance of this period.[31] The {48}\r\nglyphs which represent the 18 different uinals and the xma kaba kin,\r\nhowever, are shown in figures 19 and 20. The forms in figure 19 are taken\r\nfrom the inscriptions and those in figure 20 from the codices.\r\n\r\nTABLE IV. POSITIONS OF DAYS AT THE END OF A YEAR\r\n\r\n  360th day of the year   19 Cumhu  last day of the month Cumhu.\r\n  361st day of the year   0 Uayeb   first day of Uayeb.\r\n  362d  day of the year   1 Uayeb\r\n  363d  day of the year   2 Uayeb\r\n  364th day of the year   3 Uayeb\r\n  365th day of the year   4 Uayeb   last day of Uayeb and of the year.\r\n   1st day of next year   0 Pop     first day of the month Pop,\r\n                                      and of the next year.\r\n   2d  day of next year   1 Pop\r\n   3d  day of next year   2 Pop\r\n   4th day of next year   3 Pop\r\n   5th day of next year   4 Pop\r\n   6th day of next year   5 Pop\r\n   7th day of next year   6 Pop\r\n   8th day of next year   7 Pop\r\n   9th day of next year   8 Pop\r\n  10th day of next year   9 Pop\r\n  11th day of next year  10 Pop\r\n  12th day of next year  11 Pop\r\n  13th day of next year  12 Pop\r\n  14th day of next year  13 Pop\r\n  15th day of next year  14 Pop\r\n  16th day of next year  15 Pop\r\n  17th day of next year  16 Pop\r\n  18th day of next year  17 Pop\r\n  19th day of next year  18 Pop\r\n  20th day of next year  19 Pop   last day of the month Pop.\r\n  21st day of next year   0 Uo    first day of the month Uo.\r\n  22d  day of next year   1 Uo\r\n  etc.                     etc.\r\n\r\nThe signs for the first four months, Pop, Uo, Zip, and Zotz, show a\r\nconvincing similarity in both the inscriptions and the codices. The\r\nessential elements of Pop (figs. 19, _a_, and 20, _a_) are the crossed\r\nbands and the _kin_ sign. The latter is found in both the forms figured,\r\nthough only a part of the former appears in figure 20, a. Uo has two forms\r\nin the inscriptions (see fig. 19, _b_, _c_),[32] which are, however, very\r\nsimilar to each other as well as to the corresponding forms in the codices\r\n(fig. 20, _b_, _c_). The glyphs for the month Zip are identical in both\r\nfigures 19, _d_, and 20, d. The grotesque heads for Zotz in figures 19,\r\n_e_, _f_,[33] and 20, _e_, are also similar to each other. The essential\r\n{49} characteristic seems to be the prominent upturned and flaring nose.\r\nThe forms for Tzec (figs. 19, _g_, _h_, and 20, _f_) show only a very\r\ngeneral similarity, and those for Xul, the next month, are even more\r\nunlike. The only sign for Xul in the inscriptions (fig. 19, _i_, _j_) bears\r\nvery little resemblance to the common form for this month in the codices\r\n(fig. 20, _g_), though it is not unlike the variant in _h_, figure 20. The\r\nessential characteristic seems to be the familiar ear and the small mouth,\r\nshown in the inscription as an oval and in the codices as a hook surrounded\r\nwith dots.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19. The month signs in the inscriptions.]\r\n\r\n{50}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20. The month signs in the codices.]\r\n\r\nThe sign for the month Yaxkin is identical in both figures 19, _k_, _l_,\r\nand 20, _i_, _j_. The sign for the month Mol in figures 19, _m_, _n_, and\r\n20, _k_ exhibits the same close similarity. The forms for the month Chen in\r\nfigures 19, _o_, _p_, and 20, _l_, _m_, on the other hand, bear only a\r\nslight resemblance to each other. The forms for the months Yax (figs. 19,\r\n_q_, _r_, and 20, _n_), Zac (figs. 19, _s_, _t_, and 20, _o_), and Ceh\r\n(figs. 19, _u_, _v_, and {51} 20, _p_) are again identical in each case.\r\nThe signs for the next month, Mac, however, are entirely dissimilar, the\r\nform commonly found in the inscriptions (fig. 19, _w_) bearing absolutely\r\nno resemblance to that shown in figure 20, _q_, _r_, the only form for this\r\nmonth in the codices. The very unusual variant (fig. 19, _x_), from Stela\r\n25 at Piedras Negras is perhaps a trifle nearer the form found in the\r\ncodices. The flattened oval in the main part of the variant is somewhat\r\nlike the upper part of the glyph in figure 20, _q_. The essential element\r\nof the glyph for the month Mac, so far as the inscriptions are concerned,\r\nis the element () found as the superfix in both _w_ and _x_, figure 19. The\r\nsign for the month Kankin (figs. 19, _y_, _z_, and 20, _s_, _t_) and the\r\nsigns for the month Muan (figs. 19, _a'_, _b'_, and 20, _u_, _v_) show only\r\na general similarity. The signs for the last three months of the year, Pax\r\n(figs. 19, _c'_, and 20, _w_), Kayab (figs. 19, _d'-f'_, and 20, _x_, _y_),\r\nand Cumhu (figs. 19, _g'_, _h'_, and 20, _z_, _a'_, _b'_) in the\r\ninscriptions and codices, respectively, are practically identical. The\r\nclosing division of the year, the five days of the xma kaba kin, called\r\nUayeb, is represented by essentially the same glyph in both the\r\ninscriptions and the codices. Compare figure 19, _i'_, with figure 20,\r\n_c'_.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the foregoing comparison that on the whole the glyphs\r\nfor the months in the inscriptions are similar to the corresponding forms\r\nin the codices, and that such variations as are found may readily be\r\naccounted for by the fact that the codices and the inscriptions probably\r\nnot only emanate from different parts of the Maya territory but also date\r\nfrom different periods.\r\n\r\nThe student who wishes to decipher Maya writing is strongly urged to\r\nmemorize the signs for the days and months given in figures 16, 17, 19, and\r\n20, since his progress will depend largely on his ability to recognize\r\nthese glyphs when he encounters them in the texts.\r\n\r\nTHE CALENDAR ROUND, OR 18980-DAY PERIOD\r\n\r\nBefore taking up the study of the Calendar Round let us briefly summarize\r\nthe principal points ascertained in the preceding pages concerning the Maya\r\nmethod of counting time. In the first place we learned from the tonalamatl\r\n(pl. 5) three things: (1) The number of differently named days; (2) the\r\nnames of these days; (3) the order in which they invariably followed one\r\nanother. And in the second place we learned in the discussion of the Maya\r\nyear, or haab, just concluded, four other things: (1) The length of the\r\nyear; (2) the number, length, and names of the several periods into which\r\nit was divided; (3) the order in which these periods invariably followed\r\none another; (4) the positions of the days in these periods.\r\n\r\nThe proper combination of these two, the tonalamatl, or \"round of days,\"\r\nand the haab, or year of uinals, and the xma kaba kin, formed the Calendar\r\nRound, to which the tonalamatl contributed the names {52} of the days and\r\nthe haab the positions of these days in the divisions of the year. The\r\n_Calendar Round_ was the most important period in Maya chronology, and a\r\ncomprehension of its nature and of the principles which governed its\r\ncomposition is therefore absolutely essential to the understanding of the\r\nMaya system of counting time.\r\n\r\nIt has been explained (see p. 41) that the complete designation or name of\r\nany day in the tonalamatl consisted of two equally essential parts: (1) The\r\nname glyph, and (2) the numerical coefficient. Disregarding the latter for\r\nthe present, let us first see _which_ of the twenty names in Table I, that\r\nis, the name parts of the days, can stand at the beginning of the Maya\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nIn applying any sequence of names or numbers to another there are only\r\nthree possibilities concerning the names or numbers which can stand at the\r\nhead of the resulting sequence:\r\n\r\n1. When the sums of the units in each of the two sequences contain no\r\ncommon factor, each one of the units in turn will stand at the head of the\r\nresulting sequence.\r\n\r\n2. When the sum of the units in one of the two sequences is a multiple of\r\nthe sum of the units in the other, only the first unit can stand at the\r\nhead of the resulting sequence.\r\n\r\n3. When the sums of the units in the two sequences contain a common factor\r\n(except in those cases which fall under (2), that is, in which one is a\r\nmultiple of the other) only certain units can stand at the head of the\r\nsequence.\r\n\r\nNow, since our two numbers (the 20 names in Table I and the 365 days of the\r\nyear) contain a common factor, and since neither is a multiple of the\r\nother, it is clear that only the last of the three contingencies just\r\nmentioned concerns us here; and we may therefore dismiss the first two from\r\nfurther consideration.\r\n\r\nThe Maya year, then, could begin only with certain of the days in Table I,\r\nand the next task is to find out which of these twenty names invariably\r\nstood at the beginnings of the years.\r\n\r\nWhen there is a sequence of 20 names in endless repetition, it is evident\r\nthat the 361st will be the same as the 1st, since 360 = 20 × 18. Therefore\r\nthe 362d will be the same as the 2d, the 363d as the 3d, the 364th as the\r\n4th, and the 365 as the 5th. But the 365th, or 5th, name is the name of the\r\nlast day of the year, consequently the 1st day of the following year (the\r\n366th from the beginning) will have the 6th name in the sequence. Following\r\nout this same idea, it appears that the 361st day of the _second year_ will\r\nhave the same name as that with which it began, that is, the 6th name in\r\nthe sequence, the 362d day the 7th name, the 363d the 8th, the 364th the\r\n9th, and the 365th, or last day of the _second year_, the 10th name.\r\nTherefore the 1st day of the _third year_ (the 731st from the beginning)\r\nwill have the 11th name in the sequence. Similarly it could be shown {53}\r\nthat the _third year_, beginning with the 11th name, would necessarily end\r\nwith the 15th name; and the _fourth year_, beginning with the 16th name\r\n(the 1096th from the beginning) would necessarily end with the 20th, or\r\nlast name, in the sequence. It results, therefore, from the foregoing\r\nprogression that the _fifth year_ will have to begin with the 1st name (the\r\n1461st from the beginning), or the same name with which the _first year_\r\nalso began.\r\n\r\nThis is capable of mathematical proof, since the 1st day of the _fifth\r\nyear_ has the 1461st name from the beginning of the sequence, for 1461 =\r\n4×365+1 = 73×20+1. The _1_ in the second term of this equation indicates\r\nthat the beginning day of the _fifth year_ has been reached; and the _1_ in\r\nthe third term indicates that the name-part of this day is the 1st name in\r\nthe sequence of twenty. In other words, every fifth year began with a day,\r\nthe name part of which was the same, and consequently only four of the\r\nnames in Table I could stand at the beginnings of the Maya years.\r\n\r\nThe four names which successively occupied this, the most important\r\nposition of the year, were: Ik, Manik, Eb, and Caban (see Table V, in which\r\nthese four names are shown in their relation to the sequence of twenty).\r\nBeginning with any one of these, Ik for example, the next in order, Manik,\r\nis 5 days distant, the next, Eb, another five days, the next, Caban,\r\nanother 5 days, and the next, Ik, the name with which the Table started,\r\nanother 5 days.\r\n\r\nTABLE V. RELATIVE POSITIONS OF DAYS BEGINNING MAYA YEARS\r\n\r\n  IK\r\n  Akbal\r\n  Kan\r\n  Chicchan\r\n  Cimi\r\n  MANIK\r\n  Lamat\r\n  Muluc\r\n  Oc\r\n  Chuen\r\n  EB\r\n  Ben\r\n  Ix\r\n  Men\r\n  Cib\r\n  CABAN\r\n  Eznab\r\n  Cauac\r\n  Ahau\r\n  Imix\r\n\r\nSince one of the four names just given invariably began the Maya year, it\r\nfollows that in any given year, all of its nineteen divisions, the 18\r\nuinals and the xma kaba kin, also began with the same name, which was the\r\nname of the first day of the first uinal. This is necessarily true because\r\nthese 19 divisions of the year, with the exception of the last, each\r\ncontained 20 days, and consequently the name of the first day of the first\r\ndivision determined the names of the first days of all the succeeding\r\ndivisions of that particular year. Furthermore, since the xma kaba kin, the\r\nclosing division of the year, contained but 5 days, the name of the first\r\nday of the following year; as well as {54} the names of the first days of\r\nall of its divisions, was shifted forward in the sequence another 5 days,\r\nas shown above.\r\n\r\nThis leads directly to another important conclusion: Since the first days\r\nof all the divisions of any given year always had the same name-part, it\r\nfollows that the second days of all the divisions of that year had the same\r\nname, that is, the next succeeding in the sequence of twenty. The third\r\ndays in each division of that year must have had the same name, the fourth\r\ndays the same name, and so on, throughout the 20 days of the month. For\r\nexample, if a year began with the day-name Ik, all of the divisions in that\r\nyear also began with the same name, and the second days of all its\r\ndivisions had the day-name Akbal, the third days the name Kan, the fourth\r\ndays the name Chicchan, and so forth. This enables us to formulate the\r\nfollowing--\r\n\r\n_Rule._ The 20 day-names always occupy the same positions in all the\r\ndivisions of any given year.\r\n\r\nBut since the year and its divisions must begin with one of four names, it\r\nis clear that the second positions also must be filled with one of another\r\ngroup of four names, and the third positions with one of another group of\r\nfour names, and so on, through all the positions of the month. This enables\r\nus to formulate a second--\r\n\r\n_Rule._ Only four of the twenty day-names can ever occupy any given\r\nposition in the divisions of the years.\r\n\r\nBut since, in the years when Ik is the 1st name, Manik will be the 6th, Eb\r\nthe 11th, and Caban the 16th, and in the years when Manik is the 1st, Eb\r\nwill be the 6th, Caban the 11th, and Ik the 16th, and in the years when Eb\r\nis the 1st, Caban will be the 6th, Ik the 11th, and Manik the 16th, and in\r\nthe years when Caban is the 1st, Ik will be the 6th, Manik the 11th, and Eb\r\nthe 16th, it is clear that any one of this group which begins the year may\r\noccupy also three other positions in the divisions of the year, these\r\npositions being 5 days distant from each other. Consequently, it follows\r\nthat Akbal, Lamat, Ben, and Eznab in Table V, the names which occupy the\r\nsecond positions in the divisions of the year, will fill the 7th, 12th, and\r\n17th positions as well. Similarly Kan, Muluc, Ix, and Cauac will fill the\r\n3d, 8th, 13th, and 18th positions, and so on. This enables us to formulate\r\na third--\r\n\r\n_Rule._ The 20 day-names are divided into five groups of four names each,\r\nany name in any group being five days distant from the name next preceding\r\nit in the same group, and furthermore, the names of any one group will\r\noccupy four different positions in the divisions of successive years, these\r\npositions being five days apart in each case. This is expressed in Table\r\nVI, in which these groups are shown as well as the positions in the\r\ndivisions of the years which the names of each group may occupy. A\r\ncomparison with Table V will demonstrate that this arrangement is\r\ninevitable. {55}\r\n\r\nTABLE VI.

It was shown there that the first day of Pop was not written 1 Pop,\r\nbut 0 Pop, and similarly the second day of Pop was written not 2 Pop, but 1\r\nPop, and the last day, not 20 Pop, but 19 Pop. Consequently, before we can\r\nuse the names in Table VI as the Maya used them, we must make this shift,\r\nkeeping in mind, however, that Ik, Manik, Eb, and Caban (the only four of\r\nthe twenty names which could begin the year and which were written 0 Pop, 5\r\nPop, 10 Pop, or 15 Pop) would be written in our notation 1st Pop, 6th Pop,\r\n11th Pop, and 16th Pop, respectively. This difference, as has been\r\npreviously explained, results from the Maya method of counting time by\r\nelapsed periods.\r\n\r\nTable VII shows the positions of the days in the divisions of the year\r\naccording to the Maya conception, that is, with the shift in the month\r\ncoefficient made necessary by this practice of recording their days as\r\nelapsed time.\r\n\r\nThe student will find Table VII very useful in deciphering the texts, since\r\nit shows at a glance the only positions which any given day can occupy in\r\nthe divisions of the year. Therefore when the sign for a day has been\r\nrecognized in the texts, from Table VII can be ascertained the only four\r\npositions which this day can hold in the month, thus reducing the number of\r\npossible month coefficients for which search need be made, from twenty to\r\nfour.\r\n\r\nTABLE VII. POSITIONS OF DAYS IN DIVISIONS OF MAYA YEAR ACCORDING TO MAYA\r\nNOTATION\r\n\r\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  | Positions held by  |          |         |         |         |         |\r\n  | days expressed in  |{  0, 5,  |  1, 6,  |  2, 7,  |   3, 8, |  4, 9,  |\r\n  | Mayan notation     |{ 10, 15  | 11, 16  | 12, 17  |  13, 18 | 14, 19  |\r\n  |--------------------+----------+---------+---------+---------+---------+\r\n  |                    | { Ik     | Akbal   | Kan     | Chicchan| Cimi    |\r\n  | Names of days in   | { Manik  | Lamat   | Mulac   | Oc      | Chuen   |\r\n  |   each group       | { Eb     | Ben     | Ix      | Men     | Cib     |\r\n  |                    | { Caban  | Eznab   | Cauac   | Ahau    | Imix    |\r\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nNow let us summarize the points which we have successively established as\r\nresulting from the combination of the tonalamatl and haab, remembering\r\nalways that as yet we have been dealing only with {56} _the name parts of\r\nthe days and not their complete designations_. Bearing this in mind, we may\r\nstate the following facts concerning the 20 day-names and their positions\r\nin the divisions of the year:\r\n\r\n1. The Maya year and its several divisions could begin only with one of\r\nthese four day-names: Ik, Manik, Eb, and Caban.\r\n\r\n2. Consequently, any particular position in the divisions of the year could\r\nbe occupied only by one of four day-names.\r\n\r\n3. Consequently, every fifth year any particular day-name returned to the\r\nsame position in the divisions of the year.\r\n\r\n4. Consequently, any particular day-name could occupy only one of four\r\npositions in the divisions of the year, each of which it held in successive\r\nyears, returning to the same position every fifth year.\r\n\r\n5. Consequently, the twenty day-names were divided into five groups of four\r\nday-names each, any day-name of any group being five days distant from the\r\nday-name of the same group next preceding it.\r\n\r\n6. Finally, in any given year any particular day-name occupied the same\r\nrelative position throughout the divisions of that year.\r\n\r\nUp to this point, however, as above stated, we have not been dealing with\r\nthe complete designations of the Maya days, but only their _name parts_ or\r\nname glyphs, the positions of which in the several divisions of the year we\r\nhave ascertained.\r\n\r\nIt now remains to join the tonalamatl, which gives the complete names of\r\nthe 260 Maya days, to the haab, which gives the positions of the days in\r\nthe divisions of the year, in such a way that any one of the days whose\r\nname-part is Ik, Manik, Eb, or Caban shall occupy the first position of the\r\nfirst division of the year; that is, 0 Pop, or, as we should write it, the\r\nfirst day of Pop. It matters little which one of these four name parts we\r\nchoose first, since in four years each one of them in succession will have\r\nappeared in the position 0 Pop.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the easiest way to visualize the combination of the tonalamatl and\r\nthe haab is to conceive these two periods as two cogwheels revolving in\r\ncontact with each other. Let us imagine that the first of these, A (fig.\r\n21), has 260 teeth, or cogs, each one of which is named after one of the\r\n260 days of the tonalamatl and follows the sequence shown in plate 5. The\r\nsecond wheel, B (fig. 21), is somewhat larger, having 365 cogs. Each of the\r\nspaces or sockets between these represents one of the 365 positions of the\r\ndays in the divisions of the year, beginning with 0 Pop and ending with 4\r\nUayeb. See Table IV for the positions of the days at the end of one year\r\nand the commencement of the next. Finally, let us imagine that these two\r\nwheels are brought into contact with each other in such a way that the\r\ntooth or cog named 2 Ik in A shall fit into the socket named {57} 0 Pop in\r\nB, after which both wheels start to revolve in the directions indicated by\r\nthe arrows.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21. Diagram showing engagement of tonalamatl wheel of\r\n260 days (A), and haab wheel of 365 positions (B); the combination of the\r\ntwo giving the Calendar Round, or 52-year period.]\r\n\r\nThe first day of the year whose beginning is shown at the point of contact\r\nof the two wheels in figure 21 is 2 Ik 0 Pop, that is, the day 2 Ik which\r\noccupies the first position in the month Pop. The next day in succession\r\nwill be 3 Akbal 1 Pop, the next 4 Kan 2 Pop, the next 5 Chicchan 3 Pop, the\r\nnext 6 Cimi 4 Pop, and so on. As the wheels revolve in the directions\r\nindicated, the days of the tonalamatl successively fall into their\r\nappropriate positions in the divisions of the year. Since the number of\r\ncogs in A is smaller than the number in B, it is clear that the former will\r\nhave returned to its starting point, 2 Ik (that is, made one complete\r\nrevolution), before the latter will have made one complete revolution; and,\r\nfurther, that when the latter (B) has returned to its starting point, 0\r\nPop, the corresponding cog in B will not be 2 Ik, but another day (3\r\nManik), since by that time the smaller wheel will have progressed 105 cogs,\r\nor days, farther, to the cog 3 Manik.\r\n\r\nThe question now arises, how many revolutions will each wheel have to make\r\nbefore the day 2 Ik will return to the position 0 Pop. The solution of this\r\nproblem depends on the application of one sequence to another, and the\r\npossibilities concerning the numbers or names which stand at the head of\r\nthe resulting sequence, a subject already discussed on page 52. In the\r\npresent case the numbers in question, 260 and 365, contain a common factor,\r\ntherefore our problem falls under the third contingency there presented.\r\nConsequently, only certain of the 260 days can occupy the position 0 Pop,\r\nor, in other words, cog 2 Ik in A will return to the position 0 Pop in B in\r\nfewer than 260 revolutions of A. The actual solution of the problem {58} is\r\na simple question of arithmetic. Since the day 2 Ik can not return to its\r\noriginal position in A until after 260 days shall have passed, and since\r\nthe day 0 Pop can not return to its original position in B until after 365\r\ndays shall have passed, it is clear that the day 2 Ik 0 Pop can not recur\r\nuntil after a number of days shall have passed equal to the least common\r\nmultiple of these numbers, which is (260/5)×(365/5)×5, or 52×73×5 = 18,980\r\ndays. But 18,980 days = 52×365 = 73×260; in other words the day 2 Ik 0 Pop\r\ncan not recur until after 52 revolutions of B, or 52 years of 365 days\r\neach, and 73 revolutions of A, or 73 tonalamatls of 260 days each. The Maya\r\nname for this 52-year period is unknown; it has been called the Calendar\r\nRound by modern students because it was only after this interval of time\r\nhad elapsed that any given day could return to the same position in the\r\nyear. The Aztec name for this period was _xiuhmolpilli_ or\r\n_toxiuhmolpia_.[34]\r\n\r\nThe Calendar Round was the real basis of Maya chronology, since its 18,980\r\ndates included all the possible combinations of the 260 days with the 365\r\npositions of the year. Although the Maya developed a much more elaborate\r\nsystem of counting time, wherein any date of the Calendar Round could be\r\nfixed with absolute certainty within a period of 374,400 years, this truly\r\nremarkable feat was accomplished only by using a sequence of Calendar\r\nRounds, or 52-year periods, in endless repetition from a fixed point of\r\ndeparture.\r\n\r\nIn the development of their chronological system the Aztec probably never\r\nprogressed beyond the Calendar Round. At least no greater period of time\r\nthan the round of 52 years has been found in their texts. The failure of\r\nthe Aztec to develop some device which would distinguish any given day in\r\none Calendar Round from a day of the same name in another has led to\r\nhopeless confusion in regard to various events of their history. Since the\r\nsame date occurred at intervals of every 52 years, it is often difficult to\r\ndetermine the particular Calendar Round to which any given date with its\r\ncorresponding event is to be referred; consequently, the true sequence of\r\nevents in Aztec history still remains uncertain.\r\n\r\nProfessor Seler says in this connection:[35]\r\n\r\n    Anyone who has ever taken the trouble to collect the dates in old\r\n    Mexican history from the various sources must speedily have discovered\r\n    that the chronology is very much awry, that it is almost hopeless to\r\n    look for an exact chronology. The date of the fall of Mexico is\r\n    definitely fixed according to both the Indian and the Christian\r\n    chronology ... but in regard to all that precedes this date, even to\r\n    events tolerably near the time of the Spanish conquest, the statements\r\n    differ widely.\r\n\r\n{59}\r\n\r\nSuch confusion indeed is only to be expected from a system of counting time\r\nand recording events which was so loose as to permit the occurrence of the\r\nsame date twice, or even thrice, within the span of a single life; and when\r\na system so inexact was used to regulate the lapse of any considerable\r\nnumber of years, the possibilities for error and misunderstanding are\r\ninfinite. Thus it was with Aztec chronology.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, by conceiving the Calendar Rounds to be in endless\r\nrepetition from a fixed point of departure, and measuring time by an\r\naccurate system, the Maya were able to secure precision in dating their\r\nevents which is not surpassed even by our own system of counting time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22. Signs for the Calendar Round: _a_, According to\r\nGoodman; _b_, according to Förstemann.]\r\n\r\nThe glyph which stood for the Calendar Round has not been determined with\r\nany degree of certainty. Mr. Goodman believes the form shown in figure 22,\r\n_a_, to be the sign for this period, while Professor Förstemann is equally\r\nsure that the form represented by _b_ of this figure expressed the same\r\nidea. This difference of opinion between two authorities so eminent well\r\nillustrates the prevailing doubt as to just what glyph actually represented\r\nthe 52-year period among the Maya. The sign in figure 22, _a_, as the\r\nwriter will endeavor to show later, is in all probability the sign for the\r\ngreat cycle.\r\n\r\nAs will be seen in the discussion of the Long Count, the Maya, although\r\nthey conceived time to be an endless succession of Calendar Rounds, did not\r\nreckon its passage by the lapse of successive Calendar Rounds;\r\nconsequently, the need for a distinctive glyph which should represent this\r\nperiod was not acute. The contribution of the Calendar Round to Maya\r\nchronology was its 18,980 dates, and the glyphs which composed these are\r\nfound repeatedly in both the codices and the inscriptions (see figs. 16,\r\n17, 19, 20). No signs have been found as yet, however, for either the haab\r\nor the tonalamatl, probably because, like the Calendar Round, these periods\r\nwere not used as units in recording long stretches of time.\r\n\r\nIt will greatly aid the student in his comprehension of the discussion to\r\nfollow if he will constantly bear in mind the fact that one Calendar Round\r\nfollowed another without interruption or the interpolation of a single day;\r\nand further, that the Calendar Round may be likened to a large cogwheel\r\nhaving 18,980 teeth, each one of which represented one of the dates of this\r\nperiod, and that this wheel revolved forever, each cog passing a fixed\r\npoint once every 52 years. {60}\r\n\r\nTHE LONG COUNT\r\n\r\nWe have seen:\r\n\r\n1. How the Maya distinguished 1 day from the 259 others in the tonalamatl;\r\n\r\n2. How they distinguished the position of 1 day from the 364 others in the\r\nhaab, or year; and, finally,\r\n\r\n3. How by combining (1) and (2) they distinguished 1 day from the other\r\n18,979 of the Calendar Round.\r\n\r\nIt remains to explain how the Maya insured absolute accuracy in fixing a\r\nday within a period of 374,400 years, as stated above, or how they\r\ndistinguished 1 day from 136,655,999 others.\r\n\r\nThe Calendar Round, as we have seen, determined the position of a given day\r\nwithin a period of only 52 years. Consequently, in order to prevent\r\nconfusion of days of the same name in successive Calendar Rounds or, in\r\nother words, to secure absolute accuracy in dating events, it was necessary\r\nto use additional data in the description of any date.\r\n\r\nIn nearly all systems of chronology that presume to deal with really long\r\nperiods the reckoning of years proceeds from fixed starting points. Thus in\r\nChristian chronology the starting point is the Birth of Christ, and our\r\nyears are reckoned as B. C. or A. D. according as they precede or follow\r\nthis event. The Greeks reckoned time from the earliest Olympic Festival of\r\nwhich the winner's name was known, that is, the games held in 776 B. C.,\r\nwhich were won by a certain Coroebus. The Romans took as their starting\r\npoint the supposed date of the foundation of Rome, 753 B. C. The\r\nBabylonians counted time as beginning with the Era of Nabonassar, 747 B. C.\r\nThe death of Alexander the Great, in 325 B. C., ushered in the Era of\r\nAlexander. With the occupation of Babylon in 311 B. C. by Seleucus Nicator\r\nbegan the so-called Era of Seleucidæ. The conquest of Spain by Augustus\r\nCæsar in 38 B. C. marked the beginning of a chronology which endured for\r\nmore than fourteen centuries. The Mohammedans selected as their starting\r\npoint the flight of their prophet Mohammed from Mecca in 622 A. D., and\r\nevents in this chronology are described as having occurred so many years\r\nafter the Hegira (The Flight). The Persian Era began with the date 632\r\nA. D., in which year Yezdegird III ascended the throne of Persia.\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that each of the above-named systems of chronology has for\r\nits starting point some actual historic event, the occurrence, if not the\r\ndate of which, is indubitable. Some chronologies, however, commence with an\r\nevent of an altogether different character, the date of which from its very\r\nnature must always remain hypothetical. In this class should be mentioned\r\nsuch chronologies as reckon time from the Creation of the World. For\r\nexample, the Era of Constantinople, the chronological system used in the\r\nGreek Church, {61} commences with that event, supposed to have occurred in\r\n5509 B. C. The Jews reckoned the same event as having taken place in 3761\r\nB. C. and begin the counting of time from this point. A more familiar\r\nchronology, having for its starting point the Creation of the World, is\r\nthat of Archbishop Usher, in the Old Testament, which assigns this event to\r\nthe year 4004 B. C.\r\n\r\nIn common with these other civilized peoples of antiquity the ancient Maya\r\nhad realized in the development of their chronological system the need for\r\na fixed starting point, from which all subsequent events could be reckoned,\r\nand for this purpose they selected one of the dates of their Calendar\r\nRound. This was a certain date, 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu,[36] that is, a day named 4\r\nAhau, which occupied the 9th position in the month Cumhu, the next to last\r\ndivision of the Maya year (see Table III).\r\n\r\nWhile the nature of the event which took place on this date[37] is unknown,\r\nits selection as the point from which time was subsequently reckoned alone\r\nindicates that it must have been of exceedingly great importance to the\r\nnative mind. In attempting to approximate its real character, however, we\r\nare not without some assistance from the codices and the inscriptions. For\r\ninstance, it is clear that all Maya dates which it is possible to regard as\r\ncontemporaneous[38] refer to a time fully 3,000 years later than the\r\nstarting point (4 Ahau 8 Cumhu) from which each is reckoned. In other\r\nwords, Maya history is a blank for more than 3,000 years after the initial\r\ndate of the Maya chronological system, during which time no events were\r\nrecorded.\r\n\r\nThis interesting condition strongly suggests that the starting point of\r\nMaya chronology was not an actual historical event, as the founding of\r\nRome, the death of Alexander, the birth of Christ, or the flight of\r\nMohammed from Mecca, but that on the contrary it was a purely hypothetical\r\noccurrence, as the Creation of the World or the birth of the gods; and\r\nfurther, that the date 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu was not chosen as the starting point\r\nuntil long after the time it designates. This, or some similar assumption,\r\nis necessary to account satisfactorily for the observed facts:\r\n\r\n1. That, as stated, after the starting point of Maya chronology there is a\r\nsilence of more than 3,000 years, unbroken by a single contemporaneous\r\nrecord, and {62}\r\n\r\n2. That after this long period had elapsed all the dated monuments[39] had\r\ntheir origin in the comparatively short period of four centuries.\r\n\r\nConsequently, it is safe to conclude that no matter what the Maya may have\r\nbelieved took place on this date 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu, in reality when this day\r\nwas present time they had not developed their distinctive civilization or\r\neven achieved a social organization.\r\n\r\nIt is clear from the foregoing that in addition to the Calendar Round, the\r\nMaya made use of a fixed starting point in describing their dates. The next\r\nquestion is, Did they record the lapse of more than 3,000 years simply by\r\nusing so unwieldy a unit as the 52-year period or its multiples? A\r\nnumerical system based on 52 as its primary unit immediately gives rise to\r\nexceedingly awkward numbers for its higher terms; that is, 52, 104, 156,\r\n208, 260, 312, etc. Indeed, the expression of really large numbers in terms\r\nof 52 involves the use of comparatively large multipliers and hence of more\r\nor less intricate multiplications, since the unit of progression is not\r\ndecimal or even a multiple thereof. The Maya were far too clever\r\nmathematicians to have been satisfied with a numerical system which\r\nemployed units so inconvenient as 52 or its multiples, and which involved\r\nprocesses so clumsy, and we may therefore dismiss the possibility of its\r\nuse without further consideration.\r\n\r\nIn order to keep an accurate account of the large numbers used in recording\r\ndates more than 3,000 years distant from the starting point, a numerical\r\nsystem was necessary whose terms could be easily handled, like the units,\r\ntens, hundreds, and thousands of our own decimal system. Whether the desire\r\nto measure accurately the passage of time actually gave rise to their\r\nnumerical system, or vice versa, is not known, but the fact remains that\r\nthe several periods of Maya chronology (except the tonalamatl, haab, and\r\nCalendar Round, previously discussed) are the exact terms of a vigesimal\r\nsystem of numeration, with but a single exception. (See Table VIII.)\r\n\r\nTABLE VIII. THE MAYA TIME-PERIODS\r\n\r\n                   1 kin         =         1 day\r\n  20 kins        = 1 uinal       =        20 days\r\n  18 uinals      = 1 tun         =       360 days\r\n  20 tuns        = 1 katun       =     7,200 days\r\n  20 katuns      = 1 cycle       =   144,000 days\r\n  20[40] cycles  = 1 great cycle = 2,880,000 days\r\n\r\nTable VIII shows the several periods of Maya chronology by means of which\r\nthe passage of time was measured. All are the exact terms of a vigesimal\r\nsystem of numeration, except in the 2d place (uinals), {63} in which 18\r\nunits instead of 20 make 1 unit of the 3d place, or order next higher\r\n(tuns). The break in the regularity of the vigesimal progression in the 3d\r\nplace was due probably to the desire to bring the unit of this order (the\r\ntun) into agreement with the solar year of 365 days, the number 360 being\r\nmuch closer to 365 than 400, the third term of a constant vigesimal\r\nprogression. We have seen on page 45 that the 18 uinals of the haab were\r\nequivalent to 360 days or kins, precisely the number contained in the third\r\nterm of the above table, the tun. The fact that the haab, or solar year,\r\nwas composed of 5 days more than the tun, thus causing a discrepancy of 5\r\ndays as compared with the third place of the chronological system, may have\r\ngiven to these 5 closing days of the haab--that is, the xma kaba kin--the\r\nunlucky character they were reputed to possess.\r\n\r\nThe periods were numbered from 0 to 19, inclusive, 20 units of any order\r\n(except the 2d) always appearing as 1 unit of the order next higher. For\r\nexample, a number involving the use of 20 kins was written 1 uinal instead.\r\n\r\nWe are now in possession of all the different factors which the Maya\r\nutilized in recording their dates and in counting time:\r\n\r\n1. The names of their dates, of which there could be only 18,980 (the\r\nnumber of dates in the Calendar Round).\r\n\r\n2. The date, or starting point, 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu, from which time was\r\nreckoned.\r\n\r\n3. The counters, that is, the units, used in measuring the passage of time.\r\n\r\nIt remains to explain how these factors were combined to express the\r\nvarious dates of Maya chronology.\r\n\r\nINITIAL SERIES\r\n\r\nThe usual manner in which dates are written in both the codices and the\r\ninscriptions is as follows: First, there is set down a number composed of\r\nfive periods, that is, a certain number of cycles, katuns, tuns, uinals,\r\nand kins, which generally aggregate between 1,300,000 and 1,500,000 days;\r\nand this number is followed by one of the 18,980 dates of the Calendar\r\nRound. As we shall see in the next chapter, if this large number of days\r\nexpressed as above be counted forward from the fixed starting point of Maya\r\nchronology, 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu, the date invariably[41] reached will be found\r\nto be the date written at the end of the long number. This method of dating\r\nhas been called the _Initial Series_, because when inscribed on a monument\r\nit invariably stands _at the head_ of the inscription.\r\n\r\nThe student will better comprehend this Initial-series method of dating if\r\nhe will imagine the Calendar Round represented by a large cogwheel A,\r\nfigure 23, having 18,980 teeth, each one of which is {64} named after one\r\nof the dates of the calendar. Furthermore, let him suppose that the arrow B\r\nin the same figure points to the tooth, or cog, named 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu; and\r\nfinally that from this as its original position the wheel commences to\r\nrevolve in the direction indicated by the arrow in A.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23. Diagram showing section of Calendar-round wheel.]\r\n\r\nIt is clear that after one complete revolution of A, 18,980 days will have\r\npassed the starting point B, and that after two revolutions 37,960 days\r\nwill have passed, and after three, 56,940, and so on. Indeed, it is only a\r\nquestion of the number of revolutions of A until as many as 1,500,000, or\r\nany number of days in fact, will have passed the starting point B, or, in\r\nother words, will have elapsed since the initial date, 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu. This\r\nis actually what happened according to the Maya conception of time.\r\n\r\nFor example, let us imagine that a certain Initial Series expresses in\r\nterms of cycles, katuns, tuns, uinals, and kins, the number 1,461,463, and\r\nthat the date recorded by this number of days is 7 Akbal 11 Cumhu.\r\nReferring to figure 23, it is evident that 77 revolutions of the cogwheel\r\nA, that is, 77 Calendar Rounds, will use up 1,461,460 of the 1,461,463\r\ndays, since 77×18,980 = 1,461,460. Consequently, when 77 Calendar Rounds\r\nshall have passed we shall still have left 3 days (1,461,463 - 1,461,460 =\r\n3), which must be carried forward into the next Calendar Round. The\r\n1,461,461st day will be 5 Imix 9 Cumhu, that is, the day following 4 Ahau 8\r\nCumhu (see fig. 23); the 1,461,462d day will be 6 Ik 10 Cumhu, and the\r\n1,461,463d day, the last of the days in our Initial Series, 7 Akbal 11\r\nCumhu, the date recorded. Examples of this method of dating (by Initial\r\nSeries) will be given in Chapter V, where this subject will be considered\r\nin greater detail.\r\n\r\nTHE INTRODUCING GLYPH\r\n\r\nIn the inscriptions an Initial Series is invariably preceded by the\r\nso-called \"introducing glyph,\" the Maya name for which is unknown. {65}\r\nSeveral examples of this glyph are shown in figure 24. This sign is\r\ncomposed of four constant elements:\r\n\r\n  1. The trinal superfix.\r\n  2. The pair of comblike lateral appendages.\r\n  3. The tun sign (see fig. 29, _a_, _b_).\r\n  4. The trinal subfix.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24. Initial-series \"introducing glyph.\"]\r\n\r\nIn addition to these four constant elements there is one variable element\r\nwhich is always found between the pair of comblike lateral appendages. In\r\nfigure 24, _a_, _b_, _e_, this is a grotesque head; in _c_, a natural head;\r\nand in _d_, one of the 20 day-signs, Ik. This element varies greatly\r\nthroughout the inscriptions, and, judging from its central position in the\r\n\"introducing glyph\" (itself the most prominent character in every\r\ninscription in which it occurs), it must have had an exceedingly important\r\nmeaning.[42] A variant of the comblike appendages is shown in figure 24,\r\n_c_, _e_, in which these elements are replaced by a pair of fishes.\r\nHowever, in such cases, all of which occur at Copan, the treatment of the\r\nfins and tail of the fish strongly suggests the elements they replace, and\r\nit is not improbable, therefore, that the comblike appendages of the\r\n\"introducing glyph\" are nothing more nor less than conventionalized fish\r\nfins or tails; in other words, that they are a kind of glyphic synecdoche\r\nin which a part (the fin) stands for the whole (the fish). That the\r\noriginal form of this element was the fish and not its conventionalized fin\r\n() seems to be indicated by several facts: (1) On Stela D at Copan, where\r\nonly full-figure glyphs are presented,[43] the two comblike appendages of\r\nthe \"introducing glyph\" appear unmistakably as two fishes. (2) In some of\r\nthe earliest stelæ at Copan, as Stelæ 15 and P, while these elements are\r\nnot fish forms, a head (fish?) appears with the conventionalized comb\r\nelement in each case. The writer believes the interpretation of this\r\nphenomenon to be, that at the early epoch in which {66} Stelæ 15 and P were\r\nerected the conventionalization of the element in question had not been\r\nentirely accomplished, and that the head was added to indicate the form\r\nfrom which the element was derived. (3) If the fish was the original form\r\nof the comblike element in the \"introducing glyph,\" it was also the\r\noriginal form of the same element in the katun glyph. (Compare the comb\r\nelements () in figures 27, _a_, _b_, _e_, and 24, _a_, _b_, _d_ with each\r\nother.) If this is true, a natural explanation for the use of the fish in\r\nthe katun sign lies near at hand. As previously explained on page 28, the\r\ncomblike element stands for the sound _ca_ (_c_ hard); while _kal_ in Maya\r\nmeans 20. Also the element () stands for the sound _tun_. Therefore _catun_\r\nor _katun_ means 20 tuns. But the Maya word for \"fish,\" _cay_ (_c_ hard) is\r\nalso a close phonetic approximation of the sound _ca_ or _kal_.\r\nConsequently, the fish sign may have been the original element in the katun\r\nglyph, which expressed the concept 20, and which the conventionalization of\r\nglyphic forms gradually reduced to the element () without destroying,\r\nhowever, its phonetic value.\r\n\r\nWithout pressing this point further, it seems not unlikely that the\r\ncomblike elements in the katun glyph, as well as in the \"introducing\r\nglyph,\" may well have been derived from the fish sign.\r\n\r\nTurning to the codices, it must be admitted that in spite of the fact that\r\nmany Initial Series are found therein, the \"introducing glyph\" has not as\r\nyet been positively identified. It is possible, however, that the sign\r\nshown in figure 24, _f_, may be a form of the \"introducing glyph\"; at least\r\nit precedes an Initial Series in four places in the Dresden Codex (see pl.\r\n32). It is composed of the trinal superfix and a conventionalized fish (?).\r\n\r\nMr. Goodman calls this glyph (fig. 24, _a-e_) the sign for the great cycle\r\nor unit of the 6th place (see Table VIII). He bases this identification on\r\nthe fact that in the codices units of the 6th place stand immediately\r\nabove[44] units of the 5th place (cycles), and consequently since this\r\nglyph stands immediately above the units of the 5th place in the\r\ninscriptions it must stand for the units of the 6th place. While admitting\r\nthat the analogy here is close, the writer nevertheless is inclined to\r\nreject Mr. Goodman's identification on the following grounds: (1) This\r\nglyph _never_ occurs with a numerical coefficient, while units of all the\r\nother orders--that is, cycles, katuns, tuns, uinals, and kins _are never_\r\nwithout them. (2) Units of the 6th order in the codices invariably have a\r\nnumerical coefficient, as do all the other orders. (3) In the only three\r\nplaces in the inscriptions[45] in which six periods are seemingly recorded,\r\nthough not as Initial Series, the 6th period has a numerical coefficient\r\njust as have the other five, and, {67} moreover, the glyph in the 6th\r\nposition is unlike the forms in figure 24. (4) Five periods, not six, in\r\nevery Initial Series express the distance from the starting point, 4 Ahau 8\r\nCumhu, to the date recorded at the end of the long numbers.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that when the meaning of the \"introducing glyph\" has been\r\ndetermined it will be found to be quite apart from the numerical side of\r\nthe Initial Series, at least in so far as the distance of the terminal date\r\nfrom the starting point, 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu, is concerned.\r\n\r\nWhile an Initial Series in the inscriptions, as has been previously\r\nexplained, is invariably preceded by an \"introducing glyph,\" the opposite\r\ndoes not always obtain. Some of the very earliest monuments at Copan,\r\nnotably Stelæ 15, 7, and P, have \"introducing glyphs\" inscribed on two or\r\nthree of their four sides, although but one Initial Series is recorded on\r\neach of these monuments. Examples of this use of the \"introducing glyph,\"\r\nthat is, other than as standing at the head of an Initial Series, are\r\nconfined to a few of the earliest monuments at Copan, and are so rare that\r\nthe beginner will do well to disregard them altogether and to follow this\r\ngeneral rule: That in the inscriptions a glyph of the form shown in figure\r\n24, _a-e_, will invariably be followed by an Initial Series.\r\n\r\nHaving reached the conclusion that the introducing glyph was not a sign for\r\nthe period of the 6th order, let us next examine the signs for the\r\nremaining orders or periods of the chronological system (cycles, katuns,\r\ntuns, uinals, and kins), constantly bearing in mind that these five periods\r\nalone express the long numbers of an Initial Series.[46]\r\n\r\nEach of the above periods has two entirely different glyphs which may\r\nexpress it. These have been called (1) The normal form; (2) The head\r\nvariant. In the inscriptions examples of both these classes occur side by\r\nside in the same Initial Series, seemingly according to no fixed rule, some\r\nperiods being expressed by their normal forms and others by their head\r\nvariants. In the codices, on the other hand, no head-variant period glyphs\r\nhave yet been identified, and although the normal forms of the period\r\nglyphs have been found, they do not occur as units in Initial Series.\r\n\r\nAs head variants also should be classified the so-called \"full-figure\r\nglyphs,\" in which the periods given in Table VIII are represented by full\r\nfigures instead of by heads. In these forms, however, only the heads of the\r\nfigures are essential, since they alone present the determining\r\ncharacteristics, by means of which in each case identification is possible.\r\nMoreover, the head part of any full-figure variant is characterized by\r\nprecisely the same essential elements as the {68} corresponding head\r\nvariant for the same period, or in other words, the addition of the body\r\nparts in full-figure glyphs in no way influences or changes their meanings.\r\nFor this reason head-variant and full-figure forms have been treated\r\ntogether. These full-figure glyphs are exceedingly rare, having been found\r\nonly in five Initial Series throughout the Maya area: (1) On Stela D at\r\nCopan; (2) on Zoömorph B at Quirigua; (3) on east side Stela D at Quirigua;\r\n(4) on west side Stela D at Quirigua; (5) on Hieroglyphic Stairway at\r\nCopan. A few full-figure glyphs have been found also on an oblong altar at\r\nCopan, though not as parts of an Initial Series, and on Stela 15 as a\r\nperiod glyph of an Initial Series.\r\n\r\nTHE CYCLE GLYPH\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25. Signs for the cycle: _a-c_, Normal forms; _d-f_,\r\nhead variants.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26. Full-figure variant of cycle sign.]\r\n\r\nThe Maya name for the period of the 5th order in Table VIII is unknown. It\r\nhas been called \"the cycle,\" however, by Maya students, and in default of\r\nits true designation, this name has been generally adopted. The normal form\r\nof the cycle glyph is shown in figure 25, _a_, _b_, c. It is composed of an\r\nelement which appears twice over a knotted support. The repeated element\r\noccurs also in the signs for the months Chen, Yax, Zac, and Ceh (see figs.\r\n19, _o-v_, 20, _l-p_). This has been called the _Cauac_ element because it\r\nis similar to the sign for the day Cauac in the codices (fig. 17, _b'_),\r\nthough on rather inadequate grounds the writer is inclined to believe. The\r\nhead variant of the cycle glyph is shown in figure 25, _d-f_. The essential\r\ncharacteristic of this grotesque head with its long beak is the hand\r\nelement (), which forms the lower jaw, though in a _very few instances_\r\neven this is absent. In the full-figure forms this same head is joined to\r\nthe body of a bird (see fig. 26). The bird intended is clearly a parrot,\r\nthe feet, claws, and beak being portrayed in a very realistic manner. No\r\nglyph for the cycle has yet been found in the codices.\r\n\r\nTHE KATUN GLYPH\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27. Signs for the katun: _a-d_, Normal forms; _e-h_,\r\nhead variants.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28. Full-figure variant of katun sign.]\r\n\r\nThe period of the 4th place or order was called by the Maya the _katun_;\r\nthat is to say, 20 tuns, since it contained 20 units of the 3d {69} order\r\n(see Table VIII). The normal form of the katun glyph is shown in figure 27,\r\n_a-d_. It is composed of the normal form of the tun sign (fig. 29, _a_,\r\n_b_) surmounted by the pair of comblike appendages, which we have elsewhere\r\nseen meant 20, and which were probably derived from the representation of a\r\nfish. The whole glyph thus graphically portrays the concept 20 tuns, which\r\naccording to Table VIII is equal to 1 katun. The normal form of the katun\r\nglyph in the codices (fig. 27, _c_, _d_) is identical with the normal form\r\nin the inscriptions (fig. 27, _a_, _b_). Several head variants are found.\r\nThe most easily recognized, though not the most common, is shown in figure\r\n27, _e_, in which the superfix is the same as in the normal form; that is,\r\nthe element (), which probably signifies 20 in this connection. To be\r\nlogical, therefore, the head element should be the same as the head variant\r\nof the tun glyph, but this is not the case (see fig. 29, _e-h_). When this\r\nsuperfix is present, the identification of the head variant of the katun\r\nglyph is an easy matter, but when it is absent it is difficult to fix on\r\nany essential characteristic. The general shape of the head is like the\r\nhead variant of the cycle glyph. Perhaps the oval () in the top of the head\r\nin figure 27, _f_-_h_, and the small curling fang (++) represented as\r\nprotruding from the back part of the mouth are as constant as any of the\r\nother elements. The head of the full-figure variant in figure 28 presents\r\nthe same lack of essential characteristics as the head variant, though in\r\nthis form the small curling fang is also found. Again, the body attached to\r\nthis head is that of a bird which has been identified as an eagle. {70}\r\n\r\nTHE TUN GLYPH\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29. Signs for the tun: _a-d_, Normal forms; _e-h_, head\r\nvariants.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30. Full-figure variant of tun sign.]\r\n\r\nThe period of the 3d place or order was called by the Maya the _tun_, which\r\nmeans \"stone,\" possibly because a stone was set up every 360 days or each\r\ntun or some multiple thereof. Compare so-called hotun or katun stones\r\ndescribed on page 34. The normal sign for the tun in the inscriptions (see\r\nfig. 29, _a_, _b_) is identical with the form found in the codices (see\r\nfig. 29, _c_). The head variant, which bears a general resemblance to the\r\nhead variant for the cycle and katun, has several forms. The one most\r\nreadily recognized, because it has the normal sign for its superfix, is\r\nshown in figure 29, _d_, e. The determining characteristic of the head\r\nvariant of the tun glyph, however, is the fleshless lower jaw (), as shown\r\nin figure 29 _f_, _g_, though even this is lacking in some few cases. The\r\nform shown in figure 29, _h_, is found at Palenque, where it seems to\r\nrepresent the tun period in several places. The head of the full-figure\r\nform (fig. 30) has the same fleshless lower jaw for its essential\r\ncharacteristic as the head-variant forms in figure 29. The body joined to\r\nthis head is again that of a bird the identity of which has not yet been\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\nTHE UINAL GLYPH\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31. Signs for the uinal: _a-c_, Normal forms; _d-f_,\r\nhead variants.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32. Full-figure variant of uinal sign on Zoömorph B,\r\nQuirigua.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33. Full-figure variant of uinal sign on Stela D,\r\nCopan.]\r\n\r\nThe period occupying the 2d place was called by the Maya _uinal_ or _u_.\r\nThis latter word means also \"the moon\" in Maya, and the fact that the moon\r\nis visible for just about 20 days in each lunation may account for the\r\napplication of its name to the 20-day period. The normal form of the uinal\r\nglyph in the inscriptions (see fig. 31, _a_, _b_) is practically identical\r\nwith the form in the codices (see fig. 31, _c_). {71} Sometimes the\r\nsubfixial element () is omitted in the inscriptions, as in figure 31, a.\r\nThe head variant of the uinal glyph (fig. 31, _d-f_) is the most constant\r\nof all of the head forms for the various periods. Its determining\r\ncharacteristic is the large curl emerging from the back part of the mouth.\r\nThe sharp-pointed teeth in the upper jaw are also a fairly constant\r\nfeature. In very rare cases both of these elements are wanting. In such\r\ncases the glyph seems to be without determining characteristics. The animal\r\nrepresented in the full-figure variants of the uinal is that of a frog\r\n(fig. 32,) the head of which presents precisely the same characteristics as\r\nthe head variants of the uinal, just described. That the head variant of\r\nthe uinal-period glyph was originally derived from the representation of a\r\nfrog can hardly be denied in the face of such striking confirmatory\r\nevidence as that afforded by the full-figure form of the uinal in figure\r\n33. Here the spotted body, flattened head, prominent mouth, and bulging\r\neyes of the frog are so realistically portrayed that there is no doubt as\r\nto the identity of the figure intended. Mr. Bowditch (1910: p. 257) has\r\npointed out in this connection an interesting phonetic coincidence, which\r\ncan hardly be other than intentional. The Maya word for frog is _uo_, which\r\nis a fairly close phonetic approximation of _u_, the Maya word for \"moon\"\r\nor \"month.\" Consequently, the Maya may have selected the figure of the frog\r\non phonetic grounds to represent their 20-day period. If this point could\r\nbe established it would indicate an unmistakable use of the rebus form of\r\nwriting employed by the Aztec. That is, the figure of a frog in the\r\nuinal-period glyph would not recall the object which it pictures, but the\r\nsound of that object's name, _uo_, approximating the sound of _u_, which in\r\nturn expressed the intended idea, namely, the 20-day period. Mr. Bowditch\r\nhas suggested also that the grotesque birds which stand for the cycle,\r\nkatun, and tun periods in these full-figure forms may also have been chosen\r\nbecause of the phonetic similarity of their names to the names of these\r\nperiods.\r\n\r\n{72}\r\n\r\nTHE KIN GLYPH\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34. Signs for the kin: _a_, _b_, Normal forms; _c_,\r\n_d_, miscellaneous; _e-k_, head variants.]\r\n\r\nThe period of the 1st, or lowest, order was called by the Maya _kin_, which\r\nmeant the \"sun\" and by association the \"day.\" The kin, as has been\r\nexplained, was the primary unit used by the Maya in counting time. The\r\nnormal form of this period glyph in the inscriptions is shown in figure 34,\r\n_a_, which is practically identical with the form in the codices (fig. 34,\r\n_b_). In addition to the normal form of the kin sign, however, there are\r\nseveral other forms representing this period which can not be classified\r\neither as head variants or full-figure variants, as in figure 34, _c_, for\r\nexample, which bears no resemblance whatever to the normal form of the kin\r\nsign. It is difficult to understand how two characters as dissimilar as\r\nthose shown in _a_ and _c_, figure 34, could ever be used to express the\r\nsame idea, particularly since there seems to be no element common to both.\r\nIndeed, so dissimilar are they that one is almost forced to believe that\r\nthey were derived from two entirely distinct glyphs. Still another and very\r\nunusual sign for the kin is shown in figure 34, _d_; indeed, the writer\r\nrecalls but two places where it occurs: Stela 1 at Piedras Negras, and\r\nStela C (north side) at Quirigua. It is composed of the normal form of the\r\nsign for the day Ahau (fig. 16, _e'_) inverted and a subfixial element\r\nwhich varies in each of the two cases. These variants (fig. 34, _c_, _d_)\r\nare found only in the inscriptions. The head variants of the kin period\r\ndiffer from each other as much as the various normal forms above given. The\r\nform shown in figure 34, _e_, may be readily recognized by its subfixial\r\nelement () and the element (+), {73} both of which appear in the normal\r\nform, figure 34, a. In some cases, as in figure 34, _f-h_, this variant\r\nalso has the square irid and the crooked, snag-like teeth projecting from\r\nthe front of the mouth. Again, any one of these features, or even all, may\r\nbe lacking. Another and usually more grotesque type of head (fig. 34, _i_,\r\n_j_) has as its essential element the banded headdress. A very unusual head\r\nvariant is that shown in figure 34, _k_, the essential characteristic of\r\nwhich seems to be the crossbones in the eye. Mr. Bowditch has included also\r\nin his list of kin signs the form shown in figure 34, _l_, from an\r\ninscription at Tikal. While this glyph in fact does stand between two dates\r\nwhich are separated by one day from each other, that is, 6 Eb 0 Pop and 7\r\nBen 1 Pop, the writer believes, nevertheless, that only the element ()--an\r\nessential part of the normal form for the kin--here represents the period\r\none day, and that the larger characters above and below have other\r\nmeanings. In the full-figure variants of the kin sign the figure portrayed\r\nis that of a human being (fig. 35), the head of which is similar to the one\r\nin figure 34, _i_, _j_, having the same banded headdress.[47]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35. Full-figure variant of kin sign.]\r\n\r\nThis concludes the presentation of the various forms which stand for the\r\nseveral periods of Table VIII. After an exhaustive study of these as found\r\nin Maya texts the writer has reached the following generalizations\r\nconcerning them:\r\n\r\n1. _Prevalence._ The periods in Initial Series are expressed far more\r\nfrequently by head variants than by normal forms. The preponderance of the\r\nformer over the latter in all Initial Series known is in the proportion of\r\nabout 80 per cent of the total[48] against 12 per cent, the periods in the\r\nremaining 8 per cent being expressed by these two forms used side by side.\r\nIn other words, four-fifths of all the Initial Series known have their\r\nperiods expressed by head-variant glyphs.\r\n\r\n2. _Antiquity._ Head-variant period glyphs seem to have been used very much\r\nearlier than the normal forms. Indeed, the first use of the former preceded\r\nthe first use of the latter by about 300 years, while in Initial Series\r\nnormal-form period glyphs do not occur until nearly 100 years later, or\r\nabout 400 years after the first use of head variants for the same purpose.\r\n\r\n3. _Variation._ Throughout the range of time covered by the Initial Series\r\nthe normal forms for any given time-period differ but little from one\r\nanother, all following very closely one fixed type. Although {74} nearly\r\n200 years apart in point of time, the early form of the tun sign in figure\r\n36, _a_, closely resembles the late form shown in _b_ of the same figure,\r\nas to its essentials. Or again, although 375 years apart, the early form of\r\nthe katun sign in figure 36, _c_, is practically identical with the form in\r\nfigure 36, d. Instances of this kind could be multiplied indefinitely, but\r\nthe foregoing are sufficient to demonstrate that in so far as the\r\nnormal-form period glyphs are concerned but little variation occurred from\r\nfirst to last. Similarly, it may be said, the head variants for any given\r\nperiod, while differing greatly in appearance at different epochs,\r\nretained, nevertheless, the same essential characteristic throughout. For\r\nexample, although the uinal sign in figure 36, _e_, precedes the one in\r\nfigure 36, _f_, by some 800 years, the same essential element--the large\r\nmouth curl--appears in both. Again, although 300 years separate the cycle\r\nsigns shown in _g_ and _h_, figure 36, the essential characteristic of the\r\nearly form (fig. 36, _g_), the hand, is still retained as the essential\r\npart of the late form (_h_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36. Period glyphs, from widely separated sites and of\r\ndifferent epochs, showing persistence of essential elements.]\r\n\r\n4. _Derivation._ We have seen that the full-figure glyphs probably show the\r\noriginal life-forms from which the head variants were developed. And since\r\nfrom (2), above, it seems probable that the head variants are older than\r\nthe so-called normal forms, we may reasonably infer that the full-figure\r\nglyphs represent the life-forms whose names the Maya originally applied to\r\ntheir periods, and further that the first signs for those periods were the\r\nheads of these life-forms. This develops a contradiction in our\r\nnomenclature, for if the forms which we have called head variants are the\r\nolder signs for the periods and are by far the most prevalent, they should\r\nhave been called the normal forms and not variants, and vice versa.\r\nHowever, the use of the term \"normal forms\" is so general that it would be\r\nunwise at this time to attempt to introduce any change in nomenclature.\r\n\r\nSECONDARY SERIES\r\n\r\nThe Initial Series method of recording dates, although absolutely\r\naccurate,[49] was nevertheless somewhat lengthy, since in order to express\r\na single date by means of it eight distinct glyphs were required, namely:\r\n(1) The Introducing glyph; (2) the Cycle glyph; {75} (3) the Katun glyph;\r\n(4) the Tun glyph; (5) the Uinal glyph; (6) the Kin glyph; (7) the Day\r\nglyph; (8) the Month glyph. Moreover, its use in any inscription which\r\ncontained more than one date would have resulted in needless repetition.\r\nFor example, if all the dates on any given monument were expressed by\r\nInitial Series, every one would show the long distance (more than 3,000\r\nyears) which separated it from the common starting point of Maya\r\nchronology. It would be just like writing the legal holidays of the current\r\nyear in this way: February 22d, 1913, A. D., May 30th, 1913, A. D., July\r\n4th, 1913, A. D., December 25th, 1913, A. D.; or in other words, repeating\r\nin each case the designation of time elapsed from the starting point of\r\nChristian chronology.\r\n\r\nThe Maya obviated this needless repetition by recording but one Initial\r\nSeries date on a monument;[50] and from this date as a new point of\r\ndeparture they proceeded to reckon the number of days to the next date\r\nrecorded; from this date the numbers of days to the next; and so on\r\nthroughout that inscription. By this device the position of any date in the\r\nLong Count (its Initial Series) could be calculated, since it could be\r\nreferred back to a date, the Initial Series of which was expressed. For\r\nexample, the terminal day of the Initial Series given on page 64 is 7 Akbal\r\n11 Cumhu, and its position in the Long Count is fixed by the statement in\r\ncycles, katuns, tuns, etc., that 1,461,463 days separate it from the\r\nstarting point, 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu. Now let us suppose we have the date 10 Cimi\r\n14 Cumhu, which is recorded as being 3 days later than the day 7 Akbal 11\r\nCumhu,[51] the Initial Series of which is known to be 1,461,463. It is\r\nclear that the Initial Series corresponding to the date 10 Cimi 14 Cumhu,\r\nalthough not actually expressed, will also be known since it must equal\r\n1,461,463 (Initial Series of 7 Akbal 11 Cumhu) + 3 (distance from 7 Akbal\r\n11 Cumhu to 10 Cimi 14 Cumhu), or 1,461,466. Therefore it matters not\r\nwhether we count three days forward from 7 Akbal 11 Cumhu, or whether we\r\ncount 1,461,466 days forward from the starting point of Maya chronology, 4\r\nAhau 8 Cumhu since in each case the date reached will be the same, namely,\r\n10 Cimi 14 Cumhu. The former method, however, was used more frequently than\r\nall of the other methods of recording dates combined, since it insured all\r\nthe accuracy of an Initial Series without repeating for each date so great\r\na number of days.\r\n\r\nThus having one date on a monument the Initial Series of which was\r\nexpressed, it was possible by referring subsequent dates to it, or to other\r\ndates which in turn had been referred to it, to fix accurately {76} the\r\npositions of any number of dates in the Long Count without the use of their\r\ncorresponding Initial Series. Dates thus recorded are known as \"secondary\r\ndates,\" and the periods which express their distances from other dates of\r\nknown position in the Long Count, as \"distance numbers.\" A secondary date\r\nwith its corresponding distance number has been designated a Secondary\r\nSeries. In the example above given the distance number 3 kins and the date\r\n10 Cimi 14 Cumhu would constitute a Secondary Series.\r\n\r\nHere, then, in addition to the Initial Series is a second method, the\r\nSecondary Series, by means of which the Maya recorded their dates. The\r\nearliest use of a Secondary Series with which the writer is familiar (that\r\non Stela 36 at Piedras Negras) does not occur until some 280 years after\r\nthe first Initial Series. It seems to have been a later development,\r\nprobably owing its origin to the desire to express more than one date on a\r\nsingle monument. Usually Secondary Series are to be counted from the dates\r\nnext preceding them in the inscriptions in which they are found, though\r\noccasionally they are counted from other dates which may not even be\r\nexpressed, and which can be ascertained only by counting backward the\r\ndistance number from its corresponding terminal date. The accuracy of a\r\nSecondary series date depends entirely on the fact that it has been counted\r\nfrom an Initial Series, or at least from another Secondary series date,\r\nwhich in turn has been derived from an Initial Series. If either of these\r\ncontingencies applies to any Secondary series date, it is as accurate a\r\nmethod of fixing a day in the Long Count as though its corresponding\r\nInitial Series were expressed in full. If, on the other hand, a Secondary\r\nseries date can not be referred ultimately to an Initial Series or to a\r\ndate the Initial Series of which is known though it may not be expressed,\r\nsuch a Secondary series date becomes only one of the 18,980 dates of the\r\nCalendar Round, and will recur at intervals of every 52 years. In other\r\nwords, its position in the Long Count will be unknown.\r\n\r\nCALENDAR-ROUND DATES\r\n\r\nDates of the character just described may be called Calendar-round dates,\r\nsince they are accurate only within the Calendar Round, or range of 52\r\nyears. While accurate enough for the purpose of distinguishing dates in the\r\ncourse of a single lifetime, this method breaks down when used to express\r\ndates covering a long period. Witness the chaotic condition of Aztec\r\nchronology. The Maya seem to have realized the limitations of this method\r\nof dating and did not employ it extensively. It was used chiefly at\r\nYaxchilan on the Usamacintla River, and for this reason the chronology of\r\nthat city is very much awry, and it is difficult to assign its various\r\ndates to their proper positions in the Long Count. {77}\r\n\r\nPERIOD-ENDING DATES\r\n\r\nThe Maya made use of still another method of dating, which, although not so\r\nexact as the Initial Series or the Secondary Series, is, on the other hand,\r\nfar more accurate than Calendar round dating. In this method a date was\r\ndescribed as being at the end of some particular period in the Long Count;\r\nthat is, closing a certain cycle, katun, or tun.[52] It is clear also that\r\nin this method only the name Ahau out of the 20 given in Table I can be\r\nrecorded, since it alone can stand at the end of periods higher than the\r\nkin. This is true, since:\r\n\r\n1. The higher periods, as the uinal, tun, katun, and cycle are exactly\r\ndivisible by 20 in every case (see Table VIII), and--\r\n\r\n2. They are all counted from a day, Ahau, that is, 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu.\r\nConsequently, all the periods of the Long Count, except the kin or primary\r\nunit, end with days the name parts of which are the sign Ahau.\r\n\r\nThis method of recording dates always involves the use of at least two\r\nfactors, and usually three:\r\n\r\n1. A particular period of the Long Count, as Cycle 9, or Katun 14, etc.\r\n\r\n2. The date which ends the particular period recorded, as 8 Ahau 13 Ceh, or\r\n6 Ahau 13 Muan, the closing dates respectively of Cycle 9 and Katun 14 of\r\nCycle 9; and\r\n\r\n3. A glyph or element which means \"ending\" or \"is ended,\" or which\r\nindicates at least that the period to which it is attached has come to its\r\nclose.\r\n\r\nThe first two of these factors are absolutely essential to this method of\r\ndating, while the third, the so-called \"ending sign,\" is usually, though\r\nnot invariably, present. The order in which these factors are usually found\r\nis first the date composed of the day glyph and month glyph, next the\r\n\"ending sign,\" and last the glyph of the period whose closing day has just\r\nbeen recorded. Very rarely the period glyph and its ending sign precede the\r\ndate.\r\n\r\nThe ending glyph has three distinct variants: (1) the element shown as the\r\nprefix or superfix in figure 37, _a-h_, _t_, all of which are forms of the\r\nsame variant; (2) the flattened grotesque head appearing either as the\r\nprefix or superfix in _i_, _r_, _u_, _v_ of the same figure; and (3) the\r\nhand, which appears as the main element in the forms shown in figure 37,\r\n_j-q_. The two first of these never stand by themselves but always modify\r\nsome other sign. The first (fig. 37, _a-h_, _t_) is always attached to the\r\nsign of the period whose end is recorded either as a {78} superfix (see\r\nfig. 37, _a_, whereby the end of Cycle 10 is indicated[53]), or as a prefix\r\n(see _t_, whereby the end of Katun 14 is recorded). The second form is seen\r\nas a prefix in _u_, whereby the end of Katun 12 is recorded, and in _i_,\r\nwhereby the end of Katun 11 is shown. This latter sign is found also as a\r\nsuperfix in _r_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37. Ending signs and elements.]\r\n\r\nThe hand-ending sign rarely appears as modifying period glyphs, although a\r\nfew examples of such use have been found (see fig. 37, _j_, _k_). This\r\nending sign usually appears as the main element in a separate glyph, which\r\nprecedes the sign of the period whose end is recorded (see fig. 37, _l-q_).\r\nIn these cases the subordinate elements differ somewhat, although the\r\nelement () appears as the suffix in _l_, _m_, _n_, _q_, and the element (+)\r\nas a postfix therein, also in _o_ and _p_. In a few cases the hand is\r\ncombined with the other ending signs, sometimes with one and sometimes with\r\nthe other. {79}\r\n\r\nThe use of the hand as expressing the meaning \"ending\" is quite natural.\r\nThe Aztec, we have seen, called their 52-year period the _xiuhmolpilli_, or\r\n\"year bundle.\" This implies the concomitant idea of \"tying up.\" As a period\r\nclosed, metaphorically speaking, it was \"tied up\" or \"bundled up.\" The Maya\r\nuse of the hand to express the idea \"ending\" may be a graphic\r\nrepresentation of the member by means of which this \"tying up\" was\r\neffected, the clasped hand indicating the closed period.\r\n\r\nThis method of describing a date may be called \"dating by period endings.\"\r\nIt was far less accurate than Initial-series or Secondary-series dating,\r\nsince a date described as occurring at the end of a certain katun could\r\nrecur after an interval of about 18,000 years in round numbers, as against\r\n374,400 years in the other 2 methods. For all practical purposes, however,\r\n18,000 years was as accurate as 374,400 years, since it far exceeds the\r\nrange of time covered by the written records of mankind the world over.\r\n\r\nPeriod-ending dates were not used much, and, as has been stated above, they\r\nare found only in connection with the larger periods--most frequently with\r\nthe katun, next with the cycle, and but very rarely with the tun. Mr.\r\nBowditch (1910: pp. 176 et seq.) has reviewed fully the use of ending\r\nsigns, and students are referred to his work for further information on\r\nthis subject.\r\n\r\nU KAHLAY KATUNOB\r\n\r\nIn addition to the foregoing methods of measuring time and recording dates,\r\nthe Maya of Yucatan used still another, which, however, was probably\r\nderived directly from the application of Period-ending dating to the Long\r\nCount, and consequently introduces no new elements. This has been\r\ndesignated the Sequence of the Katuns, because in this method the katun, or\r\n7,200-day period, was the unit used for measuring the passage of time. The\r\nMaya themselves called the Sequence of the Katuns _u tzolan katun_, \"the\r\nseries of the katuns\"; or _u kahlay uxocen katunob_, \"the record of the\r\ncount of the katuns\"; or even more simply, _u kahlay katunob_, \"the record\r\nof the katuns.\" These names accurately describe this system, which is\r\nsimply the record of the successive katuns, comprising in the aggregate the\r\nrange of Maya chronology.\r\n\r\nEach katun of the u kahlay katunob was named after the designation of its\r\nending day, a practice derived no doubt from Period-ending dating, and the\r\nsequence of these ending days represented passed time, each ending day\r\nstanding for the katun of which it was the close. The katun, as we have\r\nseen on page 77, always ended with some day Ahau, consequently this\r\nday-name is the only one of the twenty which appears in the u kahlay\r\nkatunob. In this method the katuns were distinguished from one another,\r\n_not_ by the positions {80} which they occupied in the cycle, as Katun 14,\r\nfor example, but by the different days Ahau with which they ended, as Katun\r\n2 Ahau, Katun 13 Ahau, etc. See Table IX.\r\n\r\nTABLE IX.--SEQUENCE OF KATUNS IN U KAHLAY KATUNOB\r\n\r\n  Katun  2 Ahau            Katun  8 Ahau\r\n  Katun 13 Ahau            Katun  6 Ahau\r\n  Katun 11 Ahau            Katun  4 Ahau\r\n  Katun  9 Ahau            Katun  2 Ahau\r\n  Katun  7 Ahau            Katun 13 Ahau\r\n  Katun  5 Ahau            Katun 11 Ahau\r\n  Katun  3 Ahau            Katun  9 Ahau\r\n  Katun  1 Ahau            Katun  7 Ahau\r\n  Katun 12 Ahau            Katun  5 Ahau\r\n  Katun 10 Ahau            Katun  3 Ahau, etc.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar retrograding sequence of the numerical coefficients in Table\r\nIX, decreasing by 2 from katun to katun, as 2, 13, 11, 9, 7, 5, 3, 1, 12,\r\netc., results directly from the number of days which the katun contains.\r\nSince the 13 possible numerical coefficients, 1 to 13, inclusive, succeed\r\neach other in endless repetition, 1 following immediately after 13, it is\r\nclear that in counting forward any given number from any given numerical\r\ncoefficient, the resulting numerical coefficient will not be affected if we\r\nfirst deduct all the 13s possible from the number to be counted forward.\r\nThe mathematical demonstration of this fact follows. If we count forward 14\r\nfrom any given coefficient, the same coefficient will be reached as if we\r\nhad counted forward but 1. This is true because, (1) there are only 13\r\nnumerical coefficients, and (2) these follow each other without\r\ninterruption, 1 following immediately after 13; hence, when 13 has been\r\nreached, the next coefficient is 1, not 14; therefore 13 or any multiple\r\nthereof may be counted forward or backward from any one of the 13 numerical\r\ncoefficients without changing its value. This truth enables us to formulate\r\nthe following rule for finding numerical coefficients: Deduct all the\r\nmultiples of 13 possible from the number to be counted forward, and then\r\ncount forward the remainder from the known coefficient, subtracting 13 if\r\nthe resulting number is above 13, since 13 is the highest possible number\r\nwhich can be attached to a day sign. If we apply this rule to the sequence\r\nof the numerical coefficients in Table IX, we shall find that it accounts\r\nfor the retrograding sequence there observed. The first katun in Table IX,\r\nKatun 2 Ahau, is named after its ending day, 2 Ahau. Now let us see whether\r\nthe application of this rule will give us 13 Ahau as the ending day of the\r\nnext katun. The number to be counted forward from 2 Ahau is 7,200, the\r\nnumber of days in one katun; therefore we must first deduct from 7,200 all\r\nthe 13s possible. 7,200 ÷ 13 = 553-11/13. In other words, after we have\r\ndeducted all the 13's possible, that is, {81} 553 of them, there is a\r\nremainder of 11. This the rule says is to be added (or counted forward)\r\nfrom the known coefficient (in this case 2) in order to reach the resulting\r\ncoefficient. 2 + 11 = 13. Since this number is not above 13, 13 is not to\r\nbe deducted from it; therefore the coefficient of the ending day of the\r\nsecond katun is 13, as shown in Table IX. Similarly we can prove that the\r\ncoefficient of the ending day of the third katun in Table IX will be 11.\r\nAgain, we have 7,200 to count forward from the known coefficient, in this\r\ncase 13 (the coefficient of the ending day of the second katun). But we\r\nhave seen above that if we deduct all the 13s possible from 7,200 there\r\nwill be a remainder of 11; consequently this remainder 11 must be added to\r\n13, the known coefficient. 13 + 11 = 24; but since this number is above 13,\r\nwe must deduct 13 from it in order to find out the resulting coefficient.\r\n24 - 13 = 11, and 11 is the coefficient of the ending day of the third\r\nkatun in Table IX. By applying the above rule, all of the coefficients of\r\nthe ending days of the katuns could be shown to follow the sequence\r\nindicated in Table IX. And since the ending days of the katuns determined\r\ntheir names, this same sequence is also that of the katuns themselves.\r\n\r\nThe above table enables us to establish a constant by means of which we can\r\nalways find the name of the next katun. Since 7,200 is always the number of\r\ndays in any katun, after deducting all the 13s possible the remainder will\r\nalways be 11, which has to be added to the known coefficient to find the\r\nunknown. But since 13 has to be deducted from the resulting number when it\r\nis above 13, subtracting 2 will always give us exactly the same coefficient\r\nas adding 11; consequently we may formulate for determining the numerical\r\ncoefficients of the ending days of katuns the following simple rule:\r\nSubtract 2 from the coefficient of the ending day of the preceding katun in\r\nevery case. A glance at Table IX will demonstrate the truth of this rule.\r\n\r\nIn the names of the katuns given in Table IX it is noteworthy that the\r\npositions which the ending days occupied in the divisions of the haab, or\r\n365-day year, are not mentioned. For example, the first katun was not\r\ncalled Katun 2 Ahau 8 Zac, but simply Katun 2 Ahau, the month part of the\r\nday, that is, its position in the year, was omitted. This omission of the\r\nmonth parts of the ending days of the katuns in the u kahlay katunob has\r\nrendered this method of dating far less accurate than any of the others\r\npreviously described except Calendar-round Dating. For example, when a date\r\nwas recorded as falling within a certain katun, as Katun 2 Ahau, it might\r\noccur anywhere within a period of 7,200 days, or nearly 20 years, and yet\r\nfulfill the given conditions. In other words, no matter how accurately this\r\nKatun 2 Ahau itself might be fixed in a _long_ stretch of time, there was\r\nalways the possibility of a maximum error of about 20 years in {82} such\r\ndating, since the statement of the katun did not fix a date any closer than\r\nas occurring somewhere within a certain 20-year period. When greater\r\naccuracy was desired the particular tun in which the date occurred was also\r\ngiven, as Tun 13 of Katun 2 Ahau. This fixed a date as falling somewhere\r\nwithin a certain 360 days, which was accurately fixed in a much longer\r\nperiod of time. Very rarely, in the case of an extremely important event,\r\nthe Calendar-round date was also given as 9 Imix 19 Zip of Tun 9 of Katun\r\n13 Ahau. A date thus described satisfying all the given conditions could\r\nnot recur until after the lapse of at least 7,000 years. The great majority\r\nof events, however, recorded by this method are described only as occurring\r\nin some particular katun, as Katun 2 Ahau, for example, no attempt being\r\nmade to refer them to any particular division (tun) of this period. Such\r\naccuracy doubtless was sufficient for recording the events of tribal\r\nhistory, since in no case could an event be more than 20 years out of the\r\nway.\r\n\r\nAside from this initial error, the accuracy of this method of dating has\r\nbeen challenged on the ground that since there were only thirteen possible\r\nnumerical coefficients, any given katun, as Katun 2 Ahau, for example, in\r\nTable IX would recur in the sequence after the lapse of thirteen katuns, or\r\nabout 256 years, thus paving the way for much confusion. While admitting\r\nthat every thirteenth katun in the sequence had the same name (see Table\r\nIX), the writer believes, nevertheless, that when the sequence of the\r\nkatuns was carefully kept, and the record of each entered immediately after\r\nits completion, so that there could be no chance of confusing it with an\r\nearlier katun of the same name in the sequence, accuracy in dating could be\r\nsecured for as long a period as the sequence remained unbroken. Indeed, the\r\nu kahlay katunob[54] from which the synopsis of Maya history given in\r\nChapter I was compiled, accurately fixes the date of events, ignoring the\r\npossible initial inaccuracy of 20 years, within a period of more than 1,100\r\nyears, a remarkable feat for any primitive chronology.\r\n\r\nHow early this method of recording dates was developed is uncertain. It has\r\nnot yet been found (surely) in the inscriptions in either the south or the\r\nnorth; on the other hand, it is so closely connected with the Long Count\r\nand Period-ending dating, which occurs repeatedly throughout the\r\ninscriptions, that it seems as though the u kahlay katunob must have been\r\ndeveloped while this system was still in use.\r\n\r\nThere should be noted here a possible exception to the above statement,\r\nnamely, that the u kahlay katunob has not been found in the inscriptions.\r\nMr. Bowditch (1910: pp. 192 et seq.) has pointed out {83} what seem to be\r\ntraces of another method of dating. This consists of some day Ahau modified\r\nby one of the two elements shown in figure 38 (_a-d_ and _e-h_,\r\nrespectively). In such cases the month part is sometimes recorded, though\r\nas frequently the day Ahau stands by itself. It is to be noted that in the\r\ngreat majority of these cases the days Ahau thus modified are the ending\r\ndays of katuns, which are either expressed or at least indicated in\r\nadjacent glyphs. In other words, the day Ahau thus modified is usually the\r\nending day of the next even katun after the last date recorded. The writer\r\nbelieves that this modification of certain days Ahau by either of the two\r\nelements shown in figure 38 may indicate that such days were the katun\r\nending days nearest to the time when the inscriptions presenting them were\r\nengraved. The snake variants shown in figure 38, _a-d_, are all from\r\nPalenque; the knot variants (_e-h_ of the same figure) are found at both\r\nCopan and Quirigua.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38. \"Snake\" or \"knot\" element as used with day sign\r\nAhau, possibly indicating presence of the u kahlay katunob in the\r\ninscriptions.]\r\n\r\nIt may be objected that one katun ending day in each inscription is far\r\ndifferent from a sequence of katun ending days as shown in Table IX, and\r\nthat one katun ending day by itself can not be construed as an u kahlay\r\nkatunob, or sequence of katuns. The difference here, however, is apparent\r\nrather than real, and results from the different character of the monuments\r\nand the native chronicles. The u kahlay katunob in Table IX is but a part\r\nof a much longer sequence of katuns, which is shown in a number of native\r\nchronicles written shortly after the Spanish Conquest, and which record the\r\nevents of Maya history for more than 1,100 years. They are in fact\r\nchronological synopses of Maya history, and from their very nature they\r\nhave to do with long periods. This is not true of the monuments,[55] which,\r\nas we have seen, were probably set up to mark the passage of certain\r\nperiods, not exceeding a katun in length in any case. Consequently, each\r\nmonument would have inscribed upon it only one or two {84} katun ending\r\ndays and the events which were connected more or less closely with it. In\r\nother words, the monuments were erected at short intervals[56] and probably\r\nrecorded events contemporaneous with their erection, while the u kahlay\r\nkatunob, on the other hand, were historical summaries reaching back to a\r\nremote time. The former were the periodicals of current events, the latter\r\nhistories of the past. The former in the great majority of cases had no\r\nconcern with the lapse of more than one or two katuns, while the latter\r\nmeasured centuries by the repetition of the same unit. The writer believes\r\nthat from the very nature of the monuments--markers of current time--no u\r\nkahlay katunob will be found on them, but that the presence of the katun\r\nending days above described indicates that the u kahlay katunob had been\r\ndeveloped while the other system was still in use. If the foregoing be\r\ntrue, the signs in figure 38, _a-h_, would have this meaning: \"On this day\r\ncame to an end the katun in which fall the accompanying dates,\" or some\r\nsimilar significance.\r\n\r\nIf we exclude the foregoing as indicating the u kahlay katunob, we have but\r\none aboriginal source, that is one antedating the Spanish Conquest, which\r\nprobably records a count of this kind. It has been stated (p. 33) that the\r\nCodex Peresianus probably treats in part at least of historical matter. The\r\nbasis for this assertion is that in this particular manuscript an u kahlay\r\nkatunob is seemingly recorded; at least there is a sequence of the ending\r\ndays of katuns shown, exactly like the one in Table IX, that is, 13 Ahau,\r\n11 Ahau, 9 Ahau, etc.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the Spanish Conquest the Long Count seems to have been\r\nrecorded entirely by the ending days of its katuns, that is, by the u\r\nkahlay katunob, and the use of Initial-series dating seems to have been\r\ndiscontinued, and perhaps even forgotten. Native as well as Spanish\r\nauthorities state that at the time of the Conquest the Maya measured time\r\nby the passage of the katuns, and no mention is made of any system of\r\ndating which resembles in the least the Initial Series so prevalent in the\r\nsouthern and older cities. While the Spanish authorities do not mention the\r\nu kahlay katunob as do the native writers, they state very clearly that\r\nthis was the system used in counting time. Says Bishop Landa (1864: p. 312)\r\nin this connection: \"The Indians not only had a count by years and days ...\r\nbut they had a certain method of counting time and their affairs by ages,\r\nwhich they made from twenty to twenty years ... these they call katunes.\"\r\nCogolludo (1688: lib. iv, cap. v, p. 186) makes a similar statement: \"They\r\ncount their eras and ages, which they put in their books from twenty to\r\ntwenty years ... [these] they call katun.\" Indeed, there can be but little\r\ndoubt that the u kahlay katunob had entirely replaced the Initial Series in\r\nrecording the Long Count centuries before the Spanish Conquest; and if the\r\nlatter method of dating were known {85} at all, the knowledge of it came\r\nonly from half-forgotten records the understanding of which was gradually\r\npassing from the minds of men.\r\n\r\nIt is clear from the foregoing that an important change in recording the\r\npassage of time took place sometime between the epoch of the great southern\r\ncities and the much later period when the northern cities flourished. In\r\nthe former, time was reckoned and dates were recorded by Initial Series; in\r\nthe latter, in so far as we can judge from post-Conquest sources, the u\r\nkahlay katunob and Calendar-round dating were the only systems used. As to\r\nwhen this change took place, we are not entirely in the dark. It is certain\r\nthat the use of the Initial Series extended to Yucatan, since monuments\r\npresenting this method of dating have been found at a few of the northern\r\ncities, namely, at Chichen Itza, Holactun, and Tuluum. On the other hand,\r\nit is equally certain that Initial Series could not have been used very\r\nextensively in the north, since they have been discovered in only these\r\nthree cities in Yucatan up to the present time. Moreover, the latest, that\r\nis, the most recent of these three, was probably contemporaneous with the\r\nrise of the Triple Alliance, a fairly early event of Northern Maya history.\r\nTaking these two points into consideration, the limited use of Initial\r\nSeries in the north and the early dates recorded in the few Initial Series\r\nknown, it seems likely that Initial-series dating did not long survive the\r\ntransplanting of the Maya civilization in Yucatan.\r\n\r\nWhy this change came about is uncertain. It could hardly have been due to\r\nthe desire for greater accuracy, since the u kahlay katunob was far less\r\nexact than Initial-series dating; not only could dates satisfying all given\r\nconditions recur much more frequently in the u kahlay katunob, but, as\r\ngenerally used, this method fixed a date merely as occurring somewhere\r\nwithin a period of about 20 years.\r\n\r\nThe writer believes the change under consideration arose from a very\r\ndifferent cause; that it was in fact the result of a tendency toward\r\ngreater brevity, which was present in the glyphic writing from the very\r\nearliest times, and which is to be noted on some of the earliest monuments\r\nthat have survived the ravages of the passing centuries. At first, when but\r\na single date was recorded on a monument, an Initial Series was used.\r\nLater, however, when the need or desire had arisen to inscribe more than\r\none date on the same monument, additional dates were _not_ expressed as\r\nInitial Series, each of which, as we have seen, involves the use of 8\r\nglyphs, but as a Secondary Series, which for the record of short periods\r\nnecessitated the use of fewer glyphs than were employed in Initial Series.\r\nIt would seem almost as though Secondary Series had been invented to avoid\r\nthe use of Initial Series when more than one date had to be recorded on the\r\nsame monument. But this tendency toward brevity in dating did not cease\r\nwith the invention of Secondary Series. Somewhat later, dating by\r\nperiod-endings was introduced, obviating the {86} necessity for the use of\r\neven one Initial Series on every monument, in order that one date might be\r\nfixed in the Long Count to which the others (Secondary Series) could be\r\nreferred. For all practical purposes, as we have seen, Period-ending dating\r\nwas as accurate as Initial-series dating for fixing dates in the Long\r\nCount, and its substitution for Initial-series dating resulted in a further\r\nsaving of glyphs and a corresponding economy of space. Still later,\r\nprobably after the Maya had colonized Yucatan, the u kahlay katunob, which\r\nwas a direct application of Period-ending dating to the Long Count, came\r\ninto general use. At this time a rich history lay behind the Maya people,\r\nand to have recorded all of its events by their corresponding Initial\r\nSeries would have been far too cumbersome a practice. The u kahlay katunob\r\noffered a convenient and facile method by means of which long stretches of\r\ntime could be recorded and events approximately dated; that is, within 20\r\nyears. This, together with the fact that the practice of setting up dated\r\nperiod-markers seems to have languished in the north, thus eliminating the\r\ngreatest medium of all for the presentation of Initial Series, probably\r\ngave rise to the change from the one method of recording time to the other.\r\n\r\nThis concludes the discussion of the five methods by means of which the\r\nMaya reckoned time and recorded dates: (1) Initial-series dating; (2)\r\nSecondary-series dating; (3) Calendar-round dating; (4) Period-ending\r\ndating; (5) Katun-ending dating, or the u kahlay katunob. While apparently\r\ndiffering considerably from one another, in reality all are expressions of\r\nthe same fundamental idea, the combination of the numbers 13 and 20 (that\r\nis, 260) with the solar year conceived as containing 365 days, and all were\r\nrecorded by the same vigesimal system of numeration; that is:\r\n\r\n1. All used precisely the same dates, the 18,980 dates of the Calendar\r\nRound;\r\n\r\n2. All may be reduced to the same fundamental unit, the day; and\r\n\r\n3. All used the same time counters, those shown in Table VIII.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the student is strongly urged constantly to bear in mind two\r\nvital characteristics of Maya chronology:\r\n\r\n1. The absolute continuity of all sequences which had to do with the\r\ncounting of time: The 13 numerical coefficients of the day names, the 20\r\nday names, the 260 days of the tonalamatl, the 365 positions of the haab,\r\nthe 18,980 dates of the Calendar Round, and the kins, uinals, tuns, katuns,\r\nand cycles of the vigesimal system of numeration. When the conclusion of\r\nany one of these sequences had been reached, the sequence began anew\r\nwithout the interruption or omission of a single unit and continued\r\nrepeating itself for all time.\r\n\r\n2. All Maya periods expressed not current time, but passed time, as in the\r\ncase of our hours, minutes, and seconds.\r\n\r\nOn these two facts rests the whole Maya conception of time. {87}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nMAYA ARITHMETIC\r\n\r\nThe present chapter will be devoted to the consideration of Maya arithmetic\r\nin its relation to the calendar. It will be shown how the Maya expressed\r\ntheir numbers and how they used their several time periods. In short, their\r\narithmetical processes will be explained, and the calculations resulting\r\nfrom their application to the calendar will be set forth.\r\n\r\nThe Maya had two different ways of writing their numerals,[57] namely: (1)\r\nWith normal forms, and (2) with head variants; that is, each of the\r\nnumerals up to and including 19 had two distinct characters which stood for\r\nit, just as in the case of the time periods and more rarely, the days and\r\nmonths. The normal forms of the numerals may be compared to our Roman\r\nfigures, since they are built up by the combination of certain elements\r\nwhich had a fixed numerical value, like the letters I, V, X, L, C, D, and\r\nM, which in Roman notation stand for the values 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, and\r\n1,000, respectively. The head-variant numerals, on the other hand, more\r\nclosely resemble our Arabic figures, since there was a special head form\r\nfor each number up to and including 13, just as there are special\r\ncharacters for the first nine figures and zero in Arabic notation.\r\nMoreover, this parallel between our Arabic figures and the Maya\r\nhead-variant numerals extends to the formation of the higher numbers. Thus,\r\nthe Maya formed the head-variant numerals for 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19 by\r\napplying the essential characteristic of the head variant for 10 to the\r\nhead variants for 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, respectively, just as the sign for\r\n10--that is, one in the tens place and zero in the units place--is used in\r\nconnection with the signs for the first nine figures in Arabic notation to\r\nform the numbers 11 to 19, inclusive. Both of these notations occur in the\r\ninscriptions, but with very few exceptions[58] no head-variant numerals\r\nhave yet been found in the codices.\r\n\r\nBAR AND DOT NUMERALS\r\n\r\nThe Maya \"Roman numerals\"--that is, the normal-form numerals, up to and\r\nincluding 19--were expressed by varying combinations of two elements, the\r\ndot (.) which represented the numeral, or numerical value, 1, and the bar,\r\nor line (--) which represented the numeral, or numerical value, 5. By\r\nvarious combinations of these two {88} elements alone the Maya expressed\r\nall the numerals from 1 to 19, inclusive. The normal forms of the numerals\r\nin the codices are shown in figure 39, in which one dot stands for 1, two\r\ndots for 2, three dots for 3, four dots for 4, one bar for 5, one bar and\r\none dot for 6, one bar and two dots for 7, one bar and three dots for 8,\r\none bar and four dots for 9, two bars for 10, and so on up to three bars\r\nand four dots for 19. The normal forms of the numerals, in the inscriptions\r\n(see fig. 40) are identical with those in the codices, excepting that they\r\nare more elaborate, the dots and bars both taking on various decorations.\r\nSome of the former contain a concentric circle () or cross-hatching ();\r\nsome appear as crescents (+) or curls (++), more rarely as (++) or (++++).\r\nThe bars show even a greater variety of treatment (see fig. 41). All these\r\ndecorations, however, in no way affect the numerical value of the bar and\r\nthe dot, which remain 5 and 1, respectively, throughout the Maya writing.\r\nSuch embellishments as those just described are found only in the\r\ninscriptions, and their use was probably due to the desire to make the bar\r\nand dot serve a decorative as well as a numerical function.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39. Normal forms of numerals 1 to 19, inclusive, in the\r\ncodices.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40. Normal forms of numerals 1 to 19, inclusive, in the\r\ninscriptions.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41. Examples of bar and dot numeral 5, showing the\r\nornamentation which the bar underwent without affecting its numerical\r\nvalue.]\r\n\r\nAn important exception to this statement should be noted here in connection\r\nwith the normal forms for the numbers 1, 2, 6, 7, 11, 12, 16, and 17, that\r\nis, all which involve the use of _one_ or _two_ dots in their\r\ncomposition.[59] In the inscriptions, as we have seen in Chapter II, every\r\nglyph was a balanced picture, exactly fitting its allotted space, even at\r\nthe cost of occasionally losing some of its elements. To have expressed the\r\nnumbers 1, 2, 6, 7, 11, 12, 16, and 17 as in the codices, with just the\r\nproper number of bars and dots in each case, would have left unsightly gaps\r\nin the outlines of the glyph blocks (see fig. 42, _a-h_, where these\r\nnumbers are shown as the coefficients of the katun sign). In _a_, _c_, _e_,\r\nand _g_ of the same figure (the numbers 1, 6, 11, and 16, respectively) the\r\nsingle dot does not fill the space on the left-hand[60] side of the bar, or\r\nbars, as the case may be, and consequently {89} the left-hand edge of the\r\nglyph block in each case is ragged. Similarly in _b_, _d_, _f_, and _h_,\r\nthe numbers 2, 7, 12, and 17, respectively, the two dots at the left of the\r\nbar or bars are too far apart to fill in the left-hand edge of the glyph\r\nblocks neatly, and consequently in these cases also the left edge is\r\nragged. The Maya were quick to note this discordant note in glyph design,\r\nand in the great majority of the places where these numbers (1, 2, 6, 7,\r\n11, 12, 16, and 17) had to be recorded, other elements of a purely\r\nornamental character were introduced to fill the empty spaces. In figure\r\n43, _a_, _c_, _e_, _g_, the spaces on each side of the single dot have been\r\nfilled with ornamental {90} crescents about the size of the dot, and these\r\ngive the glyph in each case a final touch of balance and harmony, which is\r\nlacking without them. In _b_, _d_, _f_, and _h_ of the same figure a single\r\ncrescent stands between the two numerical dots, and this again harmoniously\r\nfills in the glyph block. While the crescent () is the usual form taken by\r\nthis purely decorative element, crossed lines (**) are found in places, as\r\nin (); or, again, a pair of dotted elements (++), as in (++). These\r\nvariants, however, are of rare occurrence, the common form being the\r\ncrescent shown in figure 43.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42. Examples showing the way in which the numerals 1,\r\n2, 6, 7, 11, 12, 16, and 17 are _not_ used with period, day, or month\r\nsigns.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43. Examples showing the way in which the numerals 1,\r\n2, 6, 7, 11, 12, 16, and 17 _are_ used with period, day, or month signs.\r\nNote the filling of the otherwise vacant spaces with ornamental elements.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44. Normal forms of numerals 1 to 13, inclusive, in the\r\nBooks of Chilan Balam.]\r\n\r\nThe use of these purely ornamental elements, to fill the empty spaces in\r\nthe normal forms of the numerals 1, 2, 6, 7, 11, 12, 16, and 17, is a\r\nfruitful source of error to the student of the inscriptions. Slight\r\nweathering of an inscription is often sufficient to make ornamental\r\ncrescents look exactly like numerical dots, and consequently the numerals\r\n1, 2, 3 are frequently mistaken for one another, as are also 6, 7, and 8;\r\n11, 12, and 13; and 16, 17, and 18. The student must exercise the greatest\r\ncaution at all times in identifying these {91} numerals in the\r\ninscriptions, or otherwise he will quickly find himself involved in a\r\ntangle from which there seems to be no egress. Probably more errors in\r\nreading the inscriptions have been made through the incorrect\r\nidentification of these numerals than through any other one cause, and the\r\nstudent is urged to be continually on his guard if he would avoid making\r\nthis capital blunder.\r\n\r\nAlthough the early Spanish authorities make no mention of the fact that the\r\nMaya expressed their numbers by bars and dots, native testimony is not\r\nlacking on this point. Doctor Brinton (1882 b: p. 48) gives this extract,\r\naccompanied by the drawing shown in figure 44, from a native writer of the\r\neighteenth century who clearly describes this system of writing numbers:\r\n\r\n    They [our ancestors] used [for numerals in their calendars] dots and\r\n    lines [i. e., bars] back of them; one dot for one year, two dots for\r\n    two years, three dots for three years, four dots for four, and so on;\r\n    in addition to these they used a line; one line meant five years, two\r\n    lines meant ten years; if one line and above it one dot, six years; if\r\n    two dots above the line, seven years; if three dots above, eight years;\r\n    if four dots above the line, nine; a dot above two lines, eleven; if\r\n    two dots, twelve; if three dots, thirteen.\r\n\r\nThis description is so clear, and the values therein assigned to the\r\nseveral combinations of bars and dots have been verified so extensively\r\nthroughout both the inscriptions and the codices, that we are justified in\r\nidentifying the bar and dot as the signs for five and one, respectively,\r\nwherever they occur, whether they are found by themselves or in varying\r\ncombinations.\r\n\r\nIn the codices, as will appear in Chapter VI, the bar and dot numerals were\r\npainted in two colors, black and red. These colors were used to distinguish\r\none set of numerals from another, each of which has a different use. In\r\nsuch cases, however, bars of one color are never used with dots of the\r\nother color, each number being either all red or all black (see p. 93,\r\nfootnote 1, for the single exception to this rule).\r\n\r\nBy the development of a special character to represent the number 5 the\r\nMaya had far surpassed the Aztec in the science of mathematics; indeed, the\r\nlatter seem to have had but one numerical sign, the dot, and they were\r\nobliged to resort to the clumsy makeshift of repeating this in order to\r\nrepresent all numbers above 1. It is clearly seen that such a system of\r\nnotation has very definite limitations, which must have seriously retarded\r\nmathematical progress among the Aztec.\r\n\r\nIn the Maya system of numeration, which was vigesimal, there was no need\r\nfor a special character to represent the number 20,[61] because {92} (1) as\r\nwe have seen in Table VIII, 20 units of any order (except the 2d, in which\r\nonly 18 were required) were equal to 1 unit of the order next higher, and\r\nconsequently 20 could not be attached to any period-glyph, since this\r\nnumber of periods (with the above exception) was always recorded as 1\r\nperiod of the order next higher; and (2) although there were 20 positions\r\nin each period except the uinal, as 20 kins in each uinal, 20 tuns in each\r\nkatun, 20 katuns in each cycle, these positions were numbered not from 1 to\r\n20, but on the contrary from 0 to 19, a system which eliminated the need\r\nfor a character expressing 20.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45. Sign for 20 in the codices.]\r\n\r\nIn spite of the foregoing fact, however, the number 20 has been found in\r\nthe codices (see fig. 45). A peculiar condition there, however, accounts\r\nsatisfactorily for its presence. In the codices the sign for 20 occurs only\r\nin connection with tonalamatls, which, as we shall see later, were usually\r\nportrayed in such a manner that the numbers of which they were composed\r\ncould not be presented from bottom to top in the usual way, but had to be\r\nwritten horizontally from left to right. This destroyed the possibility of\r\nnumeration by position,[62] according to the Maya point of view, and\r\nconsequently some sign was necessary which should stand for 20 regardless\r\nof its position or relation to others. The sign shown in figure 45 was used\r\nfor this purpose. It has not yet been found in the inscriptions, perhaps\r\nbecause, as was pointed out in Chapter II, the inscriptions generally do\r\nnot appear to treat of tonalamatls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46. Sign for 0 in the codices.]\r\n\r\nIf the Maya numerical system had no vital need for a character to express\r\nthe number 20, a sign to represent zero was absolutely {93} indispensable.\r\nIndeed, any numerical system which rises to a second order of units\r\nrequires a character which will signify, when the need arises, that no\r\nunits of a certain order are involved; as zero units and zero tens, for\r\nexample, in writing 100 in our own Arabic notation.\r\n\r\nThe character zero seems to have played an important part in Maya\r\ncalculations, and signs for it have been found in both the codices and the\r\ninscriptions. The form found in the codices (fig. 46) is lenticular; it\r\npresents an interior decoration which does not follow any fixed scheme.[63]\r\nOnly a very few variants occur. The last one in figure 46 has clearly as\r\none of its elements the normal form (lenticular). The remaining two are\r\ndifferent. It is noteworthy, however, that these last three forms all stand\r\nin the 2d, or uinal, place in the texts in which they occur, though whether\r\nthis fact has influenced their variation is unknown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47. Sign for 0 in the inscriptions.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48. Figure showing possible derivation of the sign for\r\n0 in the inscriptions: _a_, Outline of the days of the tonalamatl as\r\nrepresented graphically in the Codex Tro-Cortesiano; _b_, half of same\r\noutline, which is also sign for 0 shown in fig. 47.]\r\n\r\nBoth normal forms and head variants for zero, as indeed for all the\r\nnumbers, have been found in the inscriptions. The normal forms for zero are\r\nshown in figure 47. They are common and are unmistakable. An interesting\r\norigin for this sign has been suggested by Mr. A. P. Maudslay. On pages 75\r\nand 76 of the Codex Tro-Cortesiano[64] the 260 days of a tonalamatl are\r\ngraphically represented as forming the outline shown in figure 48, a. Half\r\nof this (see fig. 48, _b_) is the sign which stands for zero (compare with\r\nfig. 47). The train of association by which half of the graphic\r\nrepresentation of a tonalamatl could come to stand for zero is not clear.\r\nPerhaps _a_ of figure 48 may have signified that a complete tonalamatl had\r\npassed with no additional days. From this the sign may have come to\r\nrepresent the idea of completeness as apart from the tonalamatl, and\r\nfinally the general idea of completeness {94} applicable to any period; for\r\nno period could be exactly complete without a fractional remainder unless\r\nall the lower periods were wanting; that is, represented by zero. Whether\r\nthis explains the connection between the outline of the tonalamatl and the\r\nzero sign, or whether indeed there be any connection between the two, is of\r\ncourse a matter of conjecture.\r\n\r\nThere is still one more normal form for zero not included in the examples\r\ngiven above, which must be described. This form (fig. 49), which occurs\r\nthroughout the inscriptions and in the Dresden Codex,[65] is chiefly\r\ninteresting because of its highly specialized function. Indeed, it was used\r\nfor one purpose only, namely, to express the first, or zero, position in\r\neach of the 19 divisions of the haab, or year, and for no other. In other\r\nwords, it denotes the positions 0 Pop, 0 Uo, 0 Zip, etc., which, as we have\r\nseen (pp. 47, 48), corresponded with our first days of the months. The\r\nforms shown in figure 49, _a_-_e_, are from the inscriptions and those in\r\n_f_-_h_ from the Dresden Codex. They are all similar. The general outline\r\nof the sign has suggested the name \"the spectacle\" glyph. Its essential\r\ncharacteristic seems to be the division into two roughly circular parts,\r\none above the other, best seen in the Dresden Codex forms (fig. 49,\r\n_f_-_h_) and a roughly circular infix in each. The lower infix is quite\r\nregular in all of the forms, being a circle or ring. The upper infix,\r\nhowever, varies considerably. In figure 49, _a_, _b_, this ring has\r\ndegenerated into a loop. In _c_ and _d_ of the same figure it has become\r\nelaborated into a head. A simpler form is that in _f_ and _g_. Although\r\ncomparatively rare, this glyph is so unusual in form that it can be readily\r\nrecognized. Moreover, if the student will bear in mind the two following\r\npoints concerning its use, he will never fail to identify it in the\r\ninscriptions: The \"spectacle\" sign (1) can be attached only to the glyphs\r\nfor the 19 divisions of the haab, or year, that is, the 18 uinals and the\r\nxma kaba kin; in other words, it is found only with the glyphs shown in\r\nfigures 19 and 20, the signs for the months in the inscriptions and\r\ncodices, respectively.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49. Special sign for 0 used exclusively as a month\r\ncoefficient.]\r\n\r\n(2) It can occur only in connection with one of the four day-signs, Ik,\r\nManik, Eb, and Caban (see figs. 16, _c_, _j_, _s_, _t_, _u_, _a'_, _b'_,\r\nand 17, _c_, _d_, _k_, _r_, _x_, _y_, respectively), since these four\r\nalone, as appears in Table VII, can occupy the 0 (zero) positions in the\r\nseveral divisions of the haab. {95}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50. Examples of the use of bar and dot numerals with\r\nperiod, day, or month signs. The translation of each glyph appears below\r\nit.]\r\n\r\nExamples of the normal-form numerals as used with the day, month, and\r\nperiod glyphs in both the inscriptions and the codices are shown in figure\r\n50. Under each is given its meaning in English.[66] The student is advised\r\nto familiarize himself with these forms, since on his ability to recognize\r\nthem will largely depend his progress in reading the inscriptions. This\r\nfigure illustrates the use of all the foregoing forms except the sign for\r\n20 in figure 45 and the sign for zero in figure 46. As these two forms\r\nnever occur with day, month, or period glyphs, and as they have been found\r\nonly in the codices, examples showing their use will not be given until\r\nChapter VI is reached, which treats of the codices exclusively. {96}\r\n\r\nHEAD-VARIANT NUMERALS\r\n\r\nLet us next turn to the consideration of the Maya \"Arabic notation,\" that\r\nis, the head-variant numerals, which, like all other known head variants,\r\nare practically restricted to the inscriptions.[67] It should be noted here\r\nbefore proceeding further that the full-figure numerals found in connection\r\nwith full-figure period, day, and month glyphs in a few inscriptions, have\r\nbeen classified with the head-variant numerals. As explained on page 67,\r\nthe body-parts of such glyphs have no function in determining their\r\nmeanings, and it is only the head-parts which present in each case the\r\ndetermining characteristics of the form intended.\r\n\r\nIn the \"head\" notation each of the numerals, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,\r\n10, 11, 12, 13[68] is expressed by a distinctive type of head; each type\r\nhas its own essential characteristic, by means of which it can be\r\ndistinguished from all of the others. Above 13 and up to but _not\r\nincluding_ 20, the head numerals are expressed by the application of the\r\nessential characteristic of the head for 10 to the heads for 3 to 9,\r\ninclusive. No head forms for the numeral 20 have yet been discovered.\r\n\r\nThe identification of these head-variant numerals in some cases is not an\r\neasy matter, since their determining characteristics are not always\r\npresented clearly. Moreover, in the case of a few numerals, notably the\r\nheads for 2, 11, and 12, the essential elements have not yet been\r\ndetermined. Head forms for these numerals occur so rarely in the\r\ninscriptions that the comparative data are insufficient to enable us to fix\r\non any particular element as the essential one. Another difficulty\r\nencountered in the identification of head-variant numerals is the apparent\r\nirregularity of the forms in the earlier inscriptions. The essential\r\nelements of these early head numerals in some cases seem to differ widely\r\nfrom those of the later forms, and consequently it is sometimes difficult,\r\nindeed even impossible, to determine their corresponding numerical values.\r\n{97}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51. Head-variant numerals 1 to 7, inclusive.]\r\n\r\nThe head-variant numerals are shown in figures 51-53. Taking these up in\r\ntheir numerical order, let us commence with the head signifying 1; see\r\nfigure 51, _a-e_. The essential element of this head is its forehead\r\nornament, which, to signify the number 1, must be composed of more than one\r\npart (), in order to distinguish it from the forehead ornament (), which,\r\nas we shall see presently, is the essential element of the head for 8 (fig.\r\n52, _a-f_). Except for their forehead ornaments the heads for 1 and 8 are\r\nalmost identical, and great care must be exercised in order to avoid\r\nmistaking one for the other. {98}\r\n\r\nThe head for 2 (fig. 51, _f_, _g_) has been found only twice in the\r\ninscriptions--on Lintel 2 at Piedras Negras and on the tablet in the Temple\r\nof the Initial Series at Holactun. The oval at the top of the head seems to\r\nbe the only element these two forms have in common, and the writer\r\ntherefore accepts this element as the essential characteristic of the head\r\nfor 2, admitting at the same time that the evidence is insufficient.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52. Head-variant numerals 8 to 13, inclusive.]\r\n\r\nThe head for 3 is shown in figure 51, _h_, _i_. Its determining\r\ncharacteristic is the fillet, or headdress.\r\n\r\nThe head for 4 is shown in figure 51, _j-m_. It is to be distinguished by\r\nits large prominent eye and square irid (). (probably eroded in _l_), the\r\nsnaglike front tooth, and the curling fang protruding from the back part of\r\nthe mouth () (wanting in _l_ and _m_). {99}\r\n\r\nThe head for 5 (fig. 51, _n-s_) is always to be identified by its peculiar\r\nheaddress (), which is the normal form of the tun sign. Compare figure 29,\r\n_a_, b. The same element appears also in the head for 15 (see fig. 53,\r\n_b-e_). The head for 5 is one of the most constant of all the head\r\nnumerals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53. Head-variant numerals 14 to 19, inclusive, and 0.]\r\n\r\nThe head for 6 (fig. 51, _t-v_) is similarly unmistakable. It is always\r\ncharacterized by the so-called hatchet eye (), which appears also in the\r\nhead for 16 (fig. 53, _f-i_).\r\n\r\nThe head for 7 (fig. 51, _w_) is found only once in the inscriptions--on\r\nthe east side of Stela D at Quirigua. Its essential characteristic, {100}\r\nthe large ornamental scroll passing under the eye and curling up in front\r\nof the forehead (), is better seen in the head for 17 (fig. 53, _j-m_).\r\n\r\nThe head for 8 is shown in figure 52, _a-f_. It is very similar to the head\r\nfor 1, as previously explained (compare figs. 51, _a-e_ and 52, _a-f_), and\r\nis to be distinguished from it only by the character of the forehead\r\nornament, which is composed of but a single element (). In figure 52, _a_,\r\n_b_, this takes the form of a large curl. In _c_ of the same figure a\r\nflaring element is added above the curl and in _d_ and _e_ this element\r\nreplaces the curl. In _f_ the tongue or tooth of a grotesque animal head\r\nforms the forehead ornament. The heads for 18 (fig. 53, _n-q_) follow the\r\nfirst variants (fig. 51, _a_, _b_), having the large curl, except _q_,\r\nwhich is similar to _d_ in having a flaring element instead.\r\n\r\nThe head for 9 occurs more frequently than all of the others with the\r\nexception of the zero head, because the great majority of all Initial\r\nSeries record dates which fell after the completion of Cycle 9, but before\r\nthe completion of Cycle 10. Consequently, 9 is the coefficient attached to\r\nthe cycle glyph in almost all Initial Series.[69] The head for 9 is shown\r\nin figure 52, _g-l_. It has for its essential characteristic the dots on\r\nthe lower cheek or around the mouth (). Sometimes these occur in a circle\r\nor again irregularly. Occasionally, as in _j-l_, the 9 head has a beard,\r\nthough this is not a constant element as are the dots, which appear also in\r\nthe head for 19. Compare figure 53, _r_.\r\n\r\nThe head for 10 (fig. 52, _m-r_) is extremely important since its essential\r\nelement, the fleshless lower jaw (), stands for the numerical value 10, in\r\ncomposition with the heads for 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, to form the heads\r\nfor 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19, respectively. The 10 head is clearly\r\nthe fleshless skull, having the truncated nose and fleshless jaws (see fig.\r\n52, _m-p_). The fleshless lower jaw is shown in profile in all cases but\r\none--Zoömorph B at Quirigua (see _r_ of the same figure). Here a full front\r\nview of a 10 head is shown in which the fleshless jaw extends clear across\r\nthe lower part of the head, an interesting confirmation of the fact that\r\nthis characteristic is the essential element of the head for 10.\r\n\r\nThe head for 11 (fig. 52, _s_) has been found only once in the\r\ninscriptions, namely, on Lintel 2 at Piedras Negras; hence comparative data\r\nare lacking for the determination of its essential element. This head has\r\nno fleshless lower jaw and consequently would seem, therefore, not to be\r\nbuilt up of the heads for 1 and 10.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the head for 12 (fig. 52, _t-v_) has no fleshless lower jaw, and\r\nconsequently can not be composed of the heads for 10 and 2. It is to be\r\nnoted, however, that all three of the faces are of the same type, even\r\nthough their essential characteristic has not yet been determined. {101}\r\n\r\nThe head for 13 is shown in figure 52, _w-b'_. Only the first of these\r\nforms, _w_, however, is built on the 10 + 3 basis. Here we see the\r\ncharacteristic 3 head with its banded headdress or fillet (compare _h_ and\r\n_i_, fig. 51), to which has been added the essential element of the 10\r\nhead, the fleshless lower jaw, the combination of the two giving the head\r\nfor 13. The other form for 13 seems to be a special character, and not a\r\ncomposition of the essential elements of the heads for 3 and 10, as in the\r\npreceding example. This form of the 13 head (fig. 52, _x-b'_) is grotesque.\r\nIt seems to be characterized by its long pendulous nose surmounted by a\r\ncurl (), its large bulging eye (**), and a curl () or fang (++) protruding\r\nfrom the back part of the mouth. Occurrences of the first type--the\r\ncomposite head--are very rare, there being only two examples of this kind\r\nknown in all the inscriptions. The form given in _w_ is from the Temple of\r\nthe Cross at Palenque, and the other is on the Hieroglyphic Stairway at\r\nCopan. The individual type, having the pendulous nose, bulging eye, and\r\nmouth curl is by far the more frequent.\r\n\r\nThe head for 14 (fig. 53, _a_) is found but once--in the inscriptions on\r\nthe west side of Stela F at Quirigua. It has the fleshless lower jaw\r\ndenoting 10, while the rest of the head shows the characteristics of 4--the\r\nbulging eye and snaglike tooth (compare fig. 51, _j-m_). The curl\r\nprotruding from the back part of the mouth is wanting because the whole\r\nlower part of the 4 head has been replaced by the fleshless lower jaw.\r\n\r\nThe head for 15 (fig. 53, _b-e_) is composed of the essential element of\r\nthe 5 head (the tun sign; see fig. 51, _n-s_) and the fleshless lower jaw\r\nof the head for 10.\r\n\r\nThe head for 16 (fig. 53, _f-i_) is characterized by the fleshless lower\r\njaw and the hatchet eye of the 6 head. Compare figures 51, _t-v_, and 52,\r\n_m-r_, which together form 16 (10 + 6).\r\n\r\nThe head for 17 (fig. 53, _j-m_) is composed of the essential element of\r\nthe 7 head (the scroll projecting above the nose; see fig. 51, _w_) and the\r\nfleshless lower jaw of the head for 10.\r\n\r\nThe head for 18 (fig. 53, _n-q_) has the characteristic forehead ornament\r\nof the 8 head (compare fig. 52, _a-f_) and the fleshless lower jaw denoting\r\n10.\r\n\r\nOnly one example (fig. 53, _r_) of the 19 head has been found in the\r\ninscriptions. This occurs on the Temple of the Cross at Palenque and seems\r\nto be formed regularly, both the dots of the 9 head and the fleshless lower\r\njaw of the 10 head appearing.\r\n\r\nThe head for 0 (zero), figure 53, _s-w_, is always to be distinguished by\r\nthe hand clasping the lower part of the face (). In this sign for zero, the\r\nhand probably represents the idea \"ending\" or \"closing,\" just as it seems\r\nto have done in the ending signs used with {102} Period-ending dates.\r\nAccording to the Maya conception of time, when a period had ended or closed\r\nit was at zero, or at least no new period had commenced. Indeed, the normal\r\nform for zero in figure 47, the head variant for zero in figure 53, _s-w_,\r\nand the form for zero shown in figure 54 are used interchangeably in the\r\nsame inscription to express the same idea--namely, that no periods thus\r\nmodified are involved in the calculations and that consequently the end of\r\nsome higher period is recorded; that is, no fractional parts of it are\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nThat the hand in \"ending signs\" had exactly the same meaning as the hand in\r\nthe head variants for zero (fig. 53, _s-w_) receives striking corroboration\r\nfrom the rather unusual sign for zero shown in figure 54, to which\r\nattention was called above. The essential elements of this sign are[70] (1)\r\nthe clasped hand, identical with the hand in the head-variant forms for\r\nzero, and (2) the large element above it, containing a curling infix. This\r\nlatter element also occurs though below the clasped hand, in the \"ending\r\nsigns\" shown in figure 37, _l_, _m_, _n_, the first two of which accompany\r\nthe closing date of Katun 14, and the last the closing date of Cycle 13.\r\nThe resemblance of these three \"ending signs\" to the last three forms in\r\nfigure 54 is so close that the conclusion is well-nigh inevitable that they\r\nrepresented one and the same idea. The writer is of the opinion that this\r\nmeaning of the hand (ending or completion) will be found to explain its use\r\nthroughout the inscriptions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54. A sign for 0, used also to express the idea\r\n\"ending\" or \"end of\" in Period-ending dates. (See figs. 47 and 53 _s-w_,\r\nfor forms used interchangeably in the inscriptions to express the idea of 0\r\nor of completion.)]\r\n\r\nIn order to familiarize the student with the head-variant numerals, their\r\nseveral essential characteristics have been gathered together in Table X,\r\nwhere they may be readily consulted. Examples covering their use with\r\nperiod, day, and month glyphs are given in figure 55 with the corresponding\r\nEnglish translations below.\r\n\r\nHead-variant numerals do not occur as frequently as the bar and dot forms,\r\nand they seem to have been developed at a much later period. At least, the\r\nearliest Initial Series recorded with bar and dot numerals antedates by\r\nnearly two hundred years the earliest Initial Series the numbers of which\r\nare expressed by head variants. This long priority in the use of the former\r\nwould doubtless be considerably diminished if it were possible to read the\r\nearliest Initial Series which {103} have head-variant numerals; but that\r\nthe earliest of these latter antedate the earnest bar and dot Initial\r\nSeries may well be doubted.\r\n\r\nTABLE X.

This is the thumb (),\r\nwhich has a numerical value of one.\r\n\r\nWe have seen in the foregoing pages the different characters which stood\r\nfor the numerals 0 to 19, inclusive. The next point claiming our attention\r\nis, how were the higher numbers written, numbers which in the codices are\r\nin excess of 12,000,000, and in the inscriptions, in excess of 1,400,000?\r\nIn short, how were numbers so large expressed by the foregoing twenty (0 to\r\n19, inclusive) characters?\r\n\r\nThe Maya expressed their higher numbers in two ways, in both of which the\r\nnumbers rise by successive terms of the same vigesimal system:\r\n\r\n1. By using the numbers 0 to 19, inclusive, as multipliers with the several\r\nperiods of Table VIII (reduced in each case to units of the lowest order)\r\nas the multiplicands, and--\r\n\r\n2. By using the same numbers[71] in certain relative positions, each of\r\nwhich had a fixed numerical value of its own, like the positions to the\r\nright and left of the decimal point in our own numerical notation. {104}\r\n\r\nThe first of these methods is rarely found outside of the inscriptions,\r\nwhile the second is confined exclusively to the codices. Moreover, although\r\nthe first made use of both normal-form and head-variant numerals, the\r\nsecond could be expressed by normal forms only, that is, bar and dot\r\nnumerals. This enables us to draw a comparison between these two forms of\r\nMaya numerals:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55. Examples of the use of head-variant numerals with\r\nperiod, day, or month signs. The translation of each glyph appears below\r\nit.]\r\n\r\nHead-variant numerals never occur independently, but are always prefixed to\r\nsome period, day, or month sign. Bar and dot numerals, on the other hand,\r\nfrequently stand by themselves in the codices unattached to other signs. In\r\nsuch cases, however, some sign was to be supplied mentally with the bar and\r\ndot numeral. {105}\r\n\r\nFIRST METHOD OF NUMERATION\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 56. Examples of the first method of numeration, used\r\nalmost exclusively in the inscriptions.]\r\n\r\nIn the first of the above methods the numbers 0 to 19, inclusive, were\r\nexpressed by multiplying the kin sign by the numerals[72] 0 to 19 in turn.\r\nThus, for example, 6 days was written as shown in figure 56, _a_, 12 days\r\nas shown in _b_, and 17 days as shown in _c_ of the same {106} figure. In\r\nother words, up to and including 19 the numbers were expressed by prefixing\r\nthe sign for the number desired to the kin sign, that is, the sign for 1\r\nday.[73]\r\n\r\nThe numbers 20 to 359, inclusive, were expressed by multiplying both the\r\nkin and uinal signs by the numerical forms 0 to 19, and adding together the\r\nresulting products. For example, the number 257 was written as shown in\r\nfigure 56, d. We have seen in Table VIII that 1 uinal = 20 kins,\r\nconsequently 12 uinals (the 12 being indicated by 2 bars and 2 dots) = 240\r\nkins. However, as this number falls short of 257 by 17 kins, it is\r\nnecessary to express these by 17 kins, which are written immediately below\r\nthe 12 uinals. The sum of these two products = 257. Again, the number 300\r\nis written as in figure 56, e. The 15 uinals (three bars attached to the\r\nuinal sign) = 15 × 20 = 300 kins, exactly the number expressed. However,\r\nsince no kins are required to complete the number, it is necessary to show\r\nthat none were involved, and consequently 0 kins, or \"no kins\" is written\r\nimmediately below the 15 uinals, and 300 + 0 = 300. One more example will\r\nsuffice to show how the numbers 20 to 359 were expressed. In figure 56,\r\n_f_, the number 198 is shown. The 9 uinals = 9 × 20 = 180 kins. But this\r\nnumber falls short of 198 by 18, which is therefore expressed by 18 kins\r\nwritten immediately below the 9 uinals: and the sum of these two products\r\nis 198, the number to be recorded.\r\n\r\nThe numbers 360 to 7,199, inclusive, are indicated by multiplying the kin,\r\nuinal, and tun signs by the numerals 0 to 19, and adding together the\r\nresulting products. For example, the number 360 is shown in figure 56, _g_.\r\nWe have seen in Table VIII that 1 tun = 18 uinals; but 18 uinals = 360 kins\r\n(18 × 20 = 360); therefore 1 tun also = 360 kins. However, in order to show\r\nthat no uinals and kins are involved in forming this number, it is\r\nnecessary to record this fact, which was done by writing 0 uinals\r\nimmediately below the 1 tun, and 0 kins immediately below the 0 uinals. The\r\nsum of these three products equals 360 (360 + 0 + 0 = 360). Again, the\r\nnumber 3,602 is shown in figure 56, _h_. The 10 tuns = 10 × 360 = 3,600\r\nkins. This falls short of 3,602 by only 2 units of the first order (2\r\nkins), therefore no uinals are involved in forming this number, a fact\r\nwhich is shown by the use of 0 uinals between the 10 tuns and 2 kins. The\r\nsum of these three products = 3,602 (3,600 + 0 + 2). Again, in figure 56,\r\n_i_, the number 7,100 is recorded. The 19 tuns = 19 × 360 = 6,840 kins,\r\nwhich falls short of 7,100 kins by 7,100 - 6,840 = 260 kins. But 260 kins =\r\n13 uinals with no kins {107} remaining. Consequently, the sum of these\r\nproducts equals 7,100 (6,840 + 260 + 0).\r\n\r\nThe numbers 7,200 to 143,999 were expressed by multiplying the kin, uinal,\r\ntun, and katun signs by the numerals 0 to 19, inclusive, and adding\r\ntogether the resulting products. For example, figure 56, _j_, shows the\r\nnumber 7,204. We have seen in Table VIII that 1 katun = 20 tuns, and we\r\nhave seen that 20 tuns = 7,200 kins (20 × 360); therefore 1 katun = 7,200\r\nkins. This number falls short of the number recorded by exactly 4 kins, or\r\nin other words, no tuns or uinals are involved in its composition, a fact\r\nshown by the 0 tuns and 0 uinals between the 1 katun and the 4 kins. The\r\nsum of these four products = 7,204 (7,200 + 0 + 0 + 4). The number 75,550\r\nis shown in figure 56, _k_. The 10 katuns = 72,000; the 9 tuns, 3,240; the\r\n15 uinals, 300; and the 10 kins, 10. The sum of these four products =\r\n75,550 (72,000 + 3,240 + 300 + 10). Again, the number 143,567 is shown in\r\nfigure 56, _l_. The 19 katuns = 136,800; the 18 tuns, 6,480; the 14 uinals,\r\n280; and the 7 kins, 7. The sum of these four products = 143,567 (136,800 +\r\n6,480 + 280 + 7).\r\n\r\nThe numbers 144,000 to 1,872,000 (the highest number, according to some\r\nauthorities, which has been found[74] in the inscriptions) were expressed\r\nby multiplying the kin, uinal, tun, katun, and cycle signs by the numerals\r\n0 to 19, inclusive, and adding together the resulting products. For\r\nexample, the number 987,322 is shown in figure 56, _m_. We have seen in\r\nTable VIII that 1 cycle = 20 katuns, but 20 katuns = 144,000 kins;\r\ntherefore 6 cycles = 864,000 kins; and 17 katuns = 122,400 kins; and 2\r\ntuns, 720 kins; and 10 uinals, 200 kins; and the 2 kins, 2 kins. The sum of\r\nthese five products equals the number recorded, 987,322 (864,000 + 122,400\r\n+ 720 + 200 + 2). The highest number in the inscriptions upon which all are\r\nagreed is 1,872,000, as shown in figure 56, _n_. It equals 13 cycles (13 ×\r\n144,000), and consequently all the periods below--the katun, tun, uinal,\r\nand kin--are indicated as being used 0 times.\r\n\r\nNUMBER OF CYCLES IN A GREAT CYCLE\r\n\r\nThis brings us to the consideration of an extremely important point\r\nconcerning which Maya students entertain two widely different opinions; and\r\nalthough its presentation will entail a somewhat lengthy digression from\r\nthe subject under consideration it is so pertinent to the general question\r\nof the higher numbers and their formation, that the writer has thought best\r\nto discuss it at this point.\r\n\r\nIn a vigesimal system of numeration the unit of increase is 20, and so far\r\nas the codices are concerned, as we shall presently see, this {108} number\r\nwas in fact the only unit of progression used, except in the 2d order, in\r\nwhich 18 instead of 20 units were required to make 1 unit of the 3d order.\r\nIn other words, in the codices the Maya carried out their vigesimal system\r\nto _six places_ without a break other than the one in the 2d place, just\r\nnoted. See Table VIII.\r\n\r\nIn the inscriptions, however, there is some ground for believing that only\r\n13 units of the 5th order (cycles), not 20, were required to make 1 unit of\r\nthe 6th order, or 1 great cycle. Both Mr. Bowditch (1910: App. IX, 319-321)\r\nand Mr. Goodman (1897: p. 25) incline to this opinion, and the former, in\r\nAppendix IX of his book, presents the evidence at some length for and\r\nagainst this hypothesis.\r\n\r\nThis hypothesis rests mainly on the two following points:\r\n\r\n1. That the cycles in the inscriptions are numbered from 1 to 13,\r\ninclusive, and not from 0 to 19, inclusive, as in the case of all the other\r\nperiods except the uinal, which is numbered from 0 to 17, inclusive.\r\n\r\n2. That the only two Initial Series which are not counted from the date 4\r\nAhau 8 Cumhu, the starting point of Maya chronology, are counted from a\r\ndate 4 Ahau 8 Zotz, which is exactly 13 cycles in advance of the former\r\ndate.\r\n\r\nLet us examine the passages in the inscriptions upon which these points\r\nrest. In three places[75] in the inscriptions the date 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu is\r\ndeclared to have occurred at the end of a Cycle 13; that is, in these three\r\nplaces this date is accompanied by an \"ending sign\" and a Cycle 13. In\r\nanother place in the inscriptions, although the starting point 4 Ahau 8\r\nCumhu is not itself expressed, the second cycle thereafter is declared to\r\nhave been a Cycle 2, not a Cycle 15, as it would have been had the cycles\r\nbeen numbered from 0 to 19, inclusive, like all the other periods.[76] In\r\nstill another place the ninth cycle after the starting point (that is, the\r\nend of a Cycle 13) is not a Cycle 2 in the _following_ great cycle, as\r\nwould be the case if the cycles were numbered from 0 to 19, inclusive, but\r\na Cycle 9, as if the cycles were numbered from 1 to 13. Again, the end of\r\nthe tenth cycle after the starting point is recorded in several places, but\r\nnot as Cycle 3 of the following great cycle, as if the cycles were numbered\r\nfrom 0 to 19, inclusive, but as Cycle 10, as would be the case if the\r\ncycles were numbered from 1 to 13. The above examples leave little doubt\r\nthat the cycles were numbered from 1 to 13, inclusive, and not from 0 to\r\n19, as in the case of the other periods. Thus, there can be no question\r\nconcerning the truth of the first of the two above points on which this\r\nhypothesis rests. {109}\r\n\r\nBut because this is true it does not necessarily follow that 13 cycles made\r\n1 great cycle. Before deciding this point let us examine the two Initial\r\nSeries mentioned above, as _not_ proceeding from the date 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu,\r\nbut from a date 4 Ahau 8 Zotz, exactly 13 cycles in advance of the former\r\ndate.\r\n\r\nThese are in the Temple of the Cross at Palenque and on the east side of\r\nStela C at Quirigua. In these two cases, if the long numbers expressed in\r\nterms of cycles, katuns, tuns, uinals, and kins are reduced to kins, and\r\ncounted forward from the date 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu, the starting point of Maya\r\nchronology, in neither case will the recorded terminal day of the Initial\r\nSeries be reached; hence these two Initial Series could not have had the\r\nday 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu as their starting point. It may be noted here that these\r\ntwo Initial Series are the only ones throughout the inscriptions known at\r\nthe present time which are not counted from the date 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu.[77]\r\nHowever, by counting _backward_ each of these long numbers from their\r\nrespective terminal days, 8 Ahau 18 Tzec, in the case of the Palenque\r\nInitial Series, and 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu, in the case of the Quirigua Initial\r\nSeries, it will be found that both of them proceed from the same starting\r\npoint, a date 4 Ahau 8 Zotz, exactly 13 cycles in advance of the starting\r\npoint of Maya chronology. Or, in other words, the starting point of all\r\nMaya Initial Series save two, was exactly 13 cycles later than the starting\r\npoint of these two. Because of this fact and the fact that the cycles were\r\nnumbered from 1 to 13, inclusive, as shown above, Mr. Bowditch and Mr.\r\nGoodman have reached the conclusion that in the inscriptions only 13 cycles\r\nwere required to make 1 great cycle.\r\n\r\nIt remains to present the points against this hypothesis, which seem to\r\nindicate that the great cycle in the inscriptions contained the same number\r\nof cycles (20) as in the codices:\r\n\r\n1. In the codices where six orders (great cycles) are recorded it takes 20\r\nof the 5th order (cycles) to make 1 of the 6th order. This absolute\r\nuniformity in a strict vigesimal progression in the codices, so similar in\r\nother respects to the inscriptions, gives presumptive support at least to\r\nthe hypothesis that the 6th order in the inscriptions was formed in the\r\nsame way.\r\n\r\n2. The numerical system in both the codices and inscriptions is identical\r\neven to the slight irregularity in the second place, where only 18 instead\r\nof 20 units were required to make 1 of the third place. It would seem\r\nprobable, therefore, that had there been any irregularity in the 5th place\r\nin the inscriptions (for such the use of 13 in a vigesimal system must be\r\ncalled), it would have been found also in the codices. {110}\r\n\r\n3. Moreover, in the inscriptions themselves the cycle glyph occurs at least\r\ntwice (see fig. 57, _a_, _b_) with a coefficient greater than 13, which\r\nwould seem to imply that more than 13 cycles could be recorded, and\r\nconsequently that it required more than 13 to make 1 of the period next\r\nhigher. The writer knows of no place in the inscriptions where 20 kins, 18\r\nuinals, 20 tuns, or 20 katuns are recorded, each of these being expressed\r\nas 1 uinal, 1 tun, 1 katun, and 1 cycle, respectively.[78] Therefore, if 13\r\ncycles had made 1 great cycle, 14 cycles would not have been recorded, as\r\nin figure 57, _a_, but as 1 great cycle and 1 cycle; and 17 cycles would\r\nnot have been recorded, as in _b_ of the same figure, but as 1 great cycle\r\nand 4 cycles. The fact that they were not recorded in this latter manner\r\nwould seem to indicate, therefore, that more than 13 cycles were required\r\nto make a great cycle, or unit of the 6th place, in the inscriptions as\r\nwell as in the codices.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 57. Signs for the cycle showing coefficients above 13:\r\n_a_, From the Temple of the Inscriptions, Palenque; _b_, from Stela N,\r\nCopan.]\r\n\r\nThe above points are simply positive evidence in support of this\r\nhypothesis, however, and in no way attempt to explain or otherwise account\r\nfor the undoubtedly contradictory points given in the discussion of (1) on\r\npages 108-109. Furthermore, not until these contradictions have been\r\ncleared away can it be established that the great cycle in the inscriptions\r\nwas of the same length as the great cycle in the codices. The writer\r\nbelieves the following explanation will satisfactorily dispose of these\r\ncontradictions and make possible at the same time the acceptance of the\r\ntheory that the great cycle in the inscriptions and in the codices was of\r\nequal length, being composed in each case of 20 cycles.\r\n\r\nAssuming for the moment that there were 13 cycles in a great cycle; it is\r\nclear that if this were the case 13 cycles could never be recorded in the\r\ninscriptions, for the reason that, being equal to 1 great cycle, they would\r\nhave to be recorded in terms of a great cycle. This is true because no\r\nperiod in the inscriptions is ever expressed, so far as now known, as the\r\nfull number of the periods of which it was composed. For example, 1 uinal\r\nnever appears as 20 kins; 1 tun is never written as its equivalent, 18\r\nuinals; 1 katun is never recorded as 20 tuns, etc. Consequently, if a great\r\ncycle composed of 13 cycles had come to its end with the end of a Cycle 13,\r\nwhich fell on a day 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu, such a Cycle 13 could never have been\r\nexpressed, since in its place would have been recorded the end of the great\r\ncycle which fell on the same day. In other words, if there had been 13\r\ncycles in a great cycle, the cycles would have been numbered from 0 to 12,\r\ninclusive, and the last, Cycle 13, would have been recorded instead as\r\ncompleting some great cycle. It is necessary to {111} admit this point or\r\nrepudiate the numeration of all the other periods in the inscriptions. The\r\nwriter believes, therefore, that, when the starting point of Maya\r\nchronology is declared to be a date 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu, which an \"ending sign\"\r\nand a Cycle 13 further declare fell at the close of a Cycle 13, this does\r\nnot indicate that there were 13 cycles in a great cycle, but that it is to\r\nbe interpreted as a Period-ending date, pure and simple. Indeed, where this\r\ndate is found in the inscriptions it occurs with a Cycle 13, and an \"ending\r\nsign\" which is practically identical with other undoubted \"ending signs.\"\r\nMoreover, if we interpret these places as indicating that there were only\r\n13 cycles in a great cycle, we have equal grounds for saying that the great\r\ncycle contained only 10 cycles. For example, on Zoömorph G at Quirigua the\r\ndate 7 Ahau 18 Zip is accompanied by an \"ending sign\" and Cycle 10, which\r\non this basis of interpretation would signify that a great cycle had only\r\n10 cycles. Similarly, it could be shown by such an interpretation that in\r\nsome cases a cycle had 14 katuns, that is, where the end of a Katun 14 was\r\nrecorded, or 17 katuns, where the end of a Katun 17 was recorded. All such\r\nplaces, including the date 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu, which closed a Cycle 13 at the\r\nstarting point of Maya chronology, are only Period-ending dates, the writer\r\nbelieves, and have no reference to the number of periods which any higher\r\nperiod contains whatsoever. They record merely the end of a particular\r\nperiod in the Long Count as the end of a certain Cycle 13, or a certain\r\nCycle 10, or a certain Katun 14, or a certain Katun 17, as the case may be,\r\nand contain no reference to the beginning or the end of the period next\r\nhigher.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt, however, as stated above, that the cycles were\r\nnumbered from 1 to 13, inclusive, and then began again with 1. This\r\nsequence strikingly recalls that of the numerical coefficients of the days,\r\nand in the parallel which this latter sequence affords, the writer\r\nbelieves, lies the true explanation of the misconception concerning the\r\nlength of the great cycle in the inscriptions.\r\n\r\nTABLE XI. SEQUENCE OF TWENTY CONSECUTIVE DATES IN THE MONTH POP\r\n\r\n   1 Ik         0 Pop\r\n   2 Akbal      1 Pop\r\n   3 Kan        2 Pop\r\n   4 Chicchan   3 Pop\r\n   5 Cimi       4 Pop\r\n   6 Manik      5 Pop\r\n   7 Lamat      6 Pop\r\n   8 Muluc      7 Pop\r\n   9 Oc         8 Pop\r\n  10 Chuen      9 Pop\r\n  11 Eb        10 Pop\r\n  12 Ben       11 Pop\r\n  13 Ix        12 Pop\r\n   1 Men       13 Pop\r\n   2 Cib       14 Pop\r\n   3 Caban     15 Pop\r\n   4 Eznab     16 Pop\r\n   5 Cauac     17 Pop\r\n   6 Ahau      18 Pop\r\n   7 Imix      19 Pop\r\n\r\nThe numerical coefficients of the days, as we have seen, were numbered from\r\n1 to 13, inclusive, and then began again with 1. See {112} Table XI, in\r\nwhich the 20 days of the month Pop are enumerated. Now it is evident from\r\nthis table that, although the coefficients of the days themselves do not\r\nrise above 13, the numbers showing the positions of these days in the month\r\ncontinue up through 19. In other words, two different sets of numerals were\r\nused in describing the Maya days: (1) The numerals 1 to 13, inclusive, the\r\ncoefficients of the days, and an integral part of their names; and (2) The\r\nnumerals 0 to 19, inclusive, showing the positions of these days in the\r\ndivisions of the year--the uinals, and the xma kaba kin. It is clear from\r\nthe foregoing, moreover, that the number of possible day coefficients (13)\r\nhas nothing whatever to do in determining the number of days in the period\r\nnext higher. That is, although the coefficients of the days are numbered\r\nfrom 1 to 13, inclusive, it does not necessarily follow that the next\r\nhigher period (the uinal) contained only 13 days. Similarly, the writer\r\nbelieves that while the cycles were undoubtedly numbered--that is,\r\nnamed--from 1 to 13, inclusive, like the coefficients of the days, it took\r\n20 of them to make a great cycle, just as it took 20 kins to make a uinal.\r\nThe two cases appear to be parallel. Confusion seems to have arisen through\r\nmistaking the _name_ of the period for its _position_ in the period next\r\nhigher--two entirely different things, as we have seen.\r\n\r\nA somewhat similar case is that of the katuns in the u kahlay katunob in\r\nTable IX. Assuming that a cycle commenced with the first katun there given,\r\nthe name of this katun is Katun 2 Ahau, although it occupied the _first_\r\nposition in the cycle. Again, the name of the second katun in the sequence\r\nis Katun 13 Ahau, although it occupied the second position in the cycle. In\r\nother words, the katuns of the u kahlay katunob were named quite\r\nindependently of their position in the period next higher (the cycle), and\r\ntheir names do not indicate the corresponding positions of the katun in the\r\nperiod next higher.\r\n\r\nApplying the foregoing explanation to those passages in the inscriptions\r\nwhich show that the enumeration of the cycles was from 1 to 13, inclusive,\r\nwe may interpret them as follows: When we find the date 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu in\r\nthe inscriptions, accompanied by an \"ending sign\" and a Cycle 13, that\r\n\"Cycle 13,\" even granting that it stands at the end of some great cycle,\r\ndoes not signify that there were only 13 cycles in the great cycle of which\r\nit was a part. On the contrary, it records only the end of a particular\r\nCycle 13, being a Period-ending date pure and simple. Such passages no more\r\nfix the length of the great cycle as containing 13 cycles than does the\r\ncoefficient 13 of the day name 13 Ix in Table XI limit the number of days\r\nin a uinal to 13, or, again, the 13 of the katun name 13 Ahau in Table IX\r\nlimit the number of katuns in a cycle to 13. This explanation not only\r\naccounts for the use of the 14 cycles or 17 cycles, as {113} shown in\r\nfigure 57, _a_, _b_, but also satisfactorily provides for the enumeration\r\nof the cycles from 1 to 13, inclusive.\r\n\r\nIf the date \"4 Ahau 8 Cumhu ending Cycle 13\" be regarded as a Period-ending\r\ndate, not as indicating that the number of cycles in a great cycle was\r\nrestricted to 13, the next question is--Did a great cycle also come to an\r\nend on the date 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu--the starting point of Maya chronology and\r\nthe closing date of a Cycle 13? That it did the writer is firmly convinced,\r\nalthough final proof of the point can not be presented until numerical\r\nseries containing more than 5 terms shall have been considered. (See pp.\r\n114-127 for this discussion.) The following points, however, which may be\r\nintroduced here, tend to prove this condition:\r\n\r\n1. In the natural course of affairs the Maya would have commenced their\r\nchronology with the beginning of some great cycle, and to have done this in\r\nthe Maya system of counting time--that is, by elapsed periods--it was\r\nnecessary to reckon from the end of the preceding great cycle as the\r\nstarting point.\r\n\r\n2. Moreover, it would seem as though the natural cycle with which to\r\ncommence counting time would be a _Cycle 1_, and if this were done time\r\nwould have to be counted from a _Cycle 13_, since a Cycle 1 could follow\r\nonly a Cycle 13.\r\n\r\nOn these two probabilities, together with the discussion on pages 114-127,\r\nthe writer is inclined to believe that the Maya commenced their chronology\r\nwith the beginning of a great cycle, whose first cycle was named Cycle 1,\r\nwhich was reckoned from the close of a great cycle whose ending cycle was a\r\nCycle 13 and whose ending day fell on the date 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu.\r\n\r\nThe second point (see p. 108) on which rests the hypothesis of \"13 cycles\r\nto a great cycle\" in the inscriptions admits of no such plausible\r\nexplanation as the first point. Indeed, it will probably never be known why\r\nin two inscriptions the Maya reckoned time from a starting point different\r\nfrom that used in all the others, one, moreover, which was 13 cycles in\r\nadvance of the other, or more than 5,000 years earlier than the beginning\r\nof their chronology, and more than 8,000 years earlier than the beginning\r\nof their historic period. That this remoter starting point, 4 Ahau 8 Zotz,\r\nfrom which proceed so far as known only two inscriptions throughout the\r\nwhole Maya area, stood at the _end_ of a great cycle the writer does not\r\nbelieve, in view of the evidence presented on pages 114-127. On the\r\ncontrary, the material given there tends to show that although the cycle\r\nwhich ended on the day 4 Ahau 8 Zotz was also named Cycle 13,[79] it was\r\nthe 8th division of the grand cycle which ended on the day 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu,\r\n{114} the starting point of Maya chronology, and not the closing division\r\nof the preceding grand cycle. However, without attempting to settle this\r\nquestion at this time, the writer inclines to the belief, on the basis of\r\nthe evidence at hand, that the great cycle in the inscriptions was of the\r\nsame length as in the codices, where it is known to have contained 20\r\ncycles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us return to the discussion interrupted on page 107, where the first\r\nmethod of expressing the higher numbers was being explained. We saw there\r\nhow the higher numbers up to and including 1,872,000 were written, and the\r\ndigression just concluded had for its purpose ascertaining how the numbers\r\nabove this were expressed; that is, whether 13 or 20 units of the 5th order\r\nwere equal to 1 unit of the 6th order. It was explained also that this\r\nnumber, 1,872,000, was perhaps the highest which has been found in the\r\ninscriptions. Three possible exceptions, however, to this statement should\r\nbe noted here: (1) On the east side of Stela N at Copan six periods are\r\nrecorded (see fig. 58); (2) on the west panel from the Temple of the\r\nInscriptions at Palenque six and probably _seven_ periods occur (see fig.\r\n59); and (3) on Stela 10 at Tikal eight and perhaps _nine_ periods are\r\nfound (see fig. 60). If in any of these cases all of the periods belong to\r\none and the same numerical series, the resulting numbers would be far\r\nhigher than 1,872,000. Indeed, such numbers would exceed by many millions\r\nall others throughout the range of Maya writings, in either the codices or\r\nthe inscriptions.\r\n\r\nBefore presenting these three numbers, however, a distinction should be\r\ndrawn between them. The first and second (figs. 58, 59) are clearly not\r\nInitial Series. Probably they are Secondary Series, although this point can\r\nnot be established with certainty, since they can not be connected with any\r\nknown date the position of which is definitely fixed. The third number\r\n(fig. 60), on the other hand, is an Initial Series, and the eight or nine\r\nperiods of which it is composed may fix the initial date of Maya chronology\r\n(4 Ahau 8 Cumhu) in a much grander chronological scheme, as will appear\r\npresently.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 58. Part of the inscription on Stela N, Copan, showing\r\na number composed of six periods.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 59. Part of the inscription in the Temple of the\r\nInscriptions, Palenque, showing a number composed of seven periods.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 60. Part of the inscription on Stela 10, Tikal\r\n(probably an Initial Series), showing a number composed of eight periods.]\r\n\r\nThe first of these three numbers (see fig. 58), if all its six periods\r\nbelong to the same series, equals 42,908,400. Although the order of the\r\nseveral periods is just the reverse of that in the numbers in figure 56,\r\nthis difference is unessential, as will shortly be explained, and in no way\r\naffects the value of the number recorded. Commencing at the bottom of\r\nfigure 58 with the highest period involved and reading up, A6,[80] the 14\r\ngreat cycles = 40,320,000 kins (see Table VIII, in which 1 great cycle =\r\n2,880,000, and consequently 14 = 14 × 2,880,000 = {115} 40,320,000); A5,\r\nthe 17 cycles = 2,448,000 kins (17 × 144,000); A4, the 19 katuns = 136,800\r\nkins (19 × 7,200); A3, the 10 tuns = 3,600 kins (10 × 360); A2, the 0\r\nuinals, 0 kins; and the 0 kins, 0 kins. The sum of these products =\r\n40,320,000 + 2,448,000 + 136,800 + 3,600 + 0 + 0 = 42,908,400.\r\n\r\nThe second of these three numbers (see fig. 59), if all of its seven terms\r\nbelong to one and the same number, equals 455,393,401. Commencing at the\r\nbottom as in figure 58, the first term A4, has the coefficient 7. Since\r\nthis is the term following the sixth, or great cycle, we may call it the\r\ngreat-great cycle. But we have seen that the {116} great cycle = 2,880,000;\r\ntherefore the great-great cycle = twenty times this number, or 57,600,000.\r\nOur text shows, however, that seven of these great-great cycles are used in\r\nthe number in question, therefore our first term = 403,200,000. The rest\r\nmay be reduced by means of Table VIII as follows: B3, 18 great cycles =\r\n51,840,000; A3, 2 cycles = 288,000; B2, 9 katuns = 64,800; A2, 1 tun = 360;\r\nB1, 12 uinals = 240; B1, 1 kin = 1. The sum of these (403,200,000 +\r\n51,840,000 + 288,000 + 64,800 + 360 + 240 +1) = 455,393,401.\r\n\r\nThe third of these numbers (see fig. 60), if all of its terms belong to one\r\nand the same number, equals 1,841,639,800. Commencing with A2, this has a\r\ncoefficient of 1. Since it immediately follows the great-great cycle, which\r\nwe found above consisted of 57,600,000, we may assume that it is the\r\ngreat-great-great cycle, and that it consisted of 20 great-great cycles, or\r\n1,152,000,000. Since its coefficient is only 1, this large number itself\r\nwill be the first term in our series. The rest may readily be reduced as\r\nfollows: A3, 11 great-great cycles = 633,600,000; A4, 19 great cycles =\r\n54,720,000; A5, 9 cycles = 1,296,000; A6, 3 katuns = 21,600; A7, 6 tuns =\r\n2,160; A8, 2 uinals = 40; A9, 0 kins = 0.[81] The sum of these\r\n(1,152,000,000 + 633,600,000 + 54,720,000 + 1,296,000 + 21,600 + 2,160 + 40\r\n+ 0) = 1,841,639,800, the highest number found anywhere in the Maya\r\nwritings, equivalent to about 5,000,000 years.\r\n\r\nWhether these three numbers are actually recorded in the inscriptions under\r\ndiscussion depends solely on the question whether or not the terms above\r\nthe cycle in each belong to one and the same series. If it could be\r\ndetermined with certainty that these higher periods in each text were all\r\nparts of the same number, there would be no further doubt as to the\r\naccuracy of the figures given above; and more important still, the 17\r\ncycles of the first number (see A5, fig. 58) would then prove conclusively\r\nthat more than 13 cycles were required to make a great cycle in the\r\ninscriptions as well as in the codices. And furthermore, the 14 great\r\ncycles in A6, figure 58, the 18 in B3, figure 59, and the 19 in A4, figure\r\n60, would also prove that more than 13 great cycles were required to make\r\none of the period next higher--that is, the great-great cycle. It is\r\nneedless to say that this point has not been universally admitted. Mr.\r\nGoodman (1897: p. 132) has suggested in the case of the Copan inscription\r\n(fig. 58) that only the lowest four periods--the 19 katuns, the 10 tuns,\r\nthe 0 uinals, and the 0 kins--A2, A3, and A4,[82] here form the number; and\r\nthat if this number is counted backward from the Initial Series of the\r\ninscription, it will reach a Katun 17 of the preceding cycle. Finally, Mr.\r\nGoodman {117} believes this Katun 17 is declared in the glyph following the\r\n19 katuns (A5), which the writer identifies as 17 cycles, and consequently\r\naccording to the Goodman interpretation the whole passage is a\r\nPeriod-ending date. Mr. Bowditch (1910: p. 321) also offers the same\r\ninterpretation as a possible reading of this passage. Even granting the\r\ntruth of the above, this interpretation still leaves unexplained the lowest\r\nglyph of the number, which has a coefficient of 14 (A6).\r\n\r\nThe strongest proof that this passage will not bear the construction placed\r\non it by Mr. Goodman is afforded by the very glyph upon which his reading\r\ndepends for its verification, namely, the glyph which he interprets Katun\r\n17. This glyph (A5) bears no resemblance to the katun sign standing\r\nimmediately above it, but on the contrary has for its lower jaw the\r\nclasping hand (), which, as we have seen, is the determining characteristic\r\nof the cycle head. Indeed, this element is so clearly portrayed in the\r\nglyph in question that its identification as a head variant for the cycle\r\nfollows almost of necessity. A comparison of this glyph with the head\r\nvariant of the cycle given in figure 25, _d-f_, shows that the two forms\r\nare practically identical. This correction deprives Mr. Goodman's reading\r\nof its chief support, and at the same time increases the probability that\r\nall the 6 terms here recorded belong to one and the same number. That is,\r\nsince the first five are the kin, uinal, tun, katun, and cycle,\r\nrespectively, it is probable that the sixth and last, which follows\r\nimmediately the fifth, without a break or interruption of any kind, belongs\r\nto the same series also, in which event this glyph would be most likely to\r\nrepresent the units of the sixth order, or the so-called great cycles.\r\n\r\nThe passages in the Palenque and Tikal texts (figs. 59 and 60,\r\nrespectively) have never been satisfactorily explained. In default of\r\ncalendric checks, as the known distance between two dates, for example,\r\nwhich may be applied to these three numbers to test their accuracy, the\r\nwriter knows of no better check than to study the characteristics of this\r\npossible great-cycle glyph in all three, and of the possible\r\ngreat-great-cycle glyph in the last two.\r\n\r\nPassing over the kins, the normal form of the uinal glyph appears in\r\nfigures 58, A2, and 59, B1 (see fig. 31, _a_, _b_), and the head variant in\r\nfigure 60, A8. (See fig. 31, _d-f_.) Below the uinal sign in A3, figure 58,\r\nand A2, figure 59, and above A7, in figure 60 the tuns are recorded as head\r\nvariants, in all three of which the fleshless lower jaw, the determining\r\ncharacteristic of the tun head, appears. Compare these three head variants\r\nwith the head variant for the tun in figure 29, _d-g_. In the Copan\r\ninscription (fig. 58) the katun glyph, A4, appears as a head variant, the\r\nessential elements of which seem to be the oval in the top part of the head\r\nand the curling fang protruding from the back part of the mouth. Compare\r\nthis head with the head variant for the katun in figure 27, _e-h_. In the\r\nPalenque and Tikal texts (see {118} figs. 59, B2, and 60, A6,\r\nrespectively), on the other hand, the katun is expressed by its normal\r\nform, which is identical with the normal form shown in figure 27, _a_, b.\r\nIn figures 58, A5, and 59, A3, the cycle is expressed by its head variant,\r\nand the determining characteristic, the clasped hand, appears in both.\r\nCompare the cycle signs in figures 58, A5, and 59, A3, with the head\r\nvariant for the cycle shown in figure 25; _d-f_. The cycle glyph in the\r\nTikal text (fig. 60, A5) is clearly the normal form. (See fig. 25, _a-c_.)\r\nThe glyph following the cycle sign in these three texts (standing above the\r\ncycle sign in figure 60 at A4) probably stands for the period of the sixth\r\norder, the so-called great cycle. These three glyphs are redrawn in figure\r\n61, _a-c_, respectively. In the Copan inscription this glyph (fig. 61, _a_)\r\nis a head variant, while in the Palenque and Tikal texts (_a_ and _b_ of\r\nthe same figure, respectively) it is a normal form.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as these three inscriptions are the only ones in which numerical\r\nseries composed of 6 or more consecutive terms are recorded, it is\r\nunfortunate that the sixth term in all three should not have been expressed\r\nby the same form, since this would have facilitated their comparison.\r\nNotwithstanding this handicap, however, the writer believes it will be\r\npossible to show clearly that the head variant in figure 61, _a_, and the\r\nnormal forms in _b_ and _c_ are only variants of one and the same sign, and\r\nthat all three stand for one and the same thing, namely, the great cycle,\r\nor unit of the sixth order.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 61. Signs for the great cycle (_a-c_), and the\r\ngreat-great cycle (_d_, _e_): _a_, Stela N, Copan; _b_, _d_, Temple of the\r\nInscriptions, Palenque; _c_, _e_, Stela 10, Tikal.]\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it will be noted that each of the three glyphs just\r\nmentioned is composed in part of the cycle sign. For example, in figure 61,\r\n_a_, the head variant has the same clasped hand as the head-variant cycle\r\nsign in the same text (see fig. 58, A5), which, as we have seen elsewhere,\r\nis the determining characteristic of the head variant for the cycle. In\r\nfigure 61, _b_, _c_, the normal forms there presented contain the entire\r\nnormal form for the cycle sign; compare figure 25, _a_, c. Indeed, except\r\nfor its superfix, the glyphs in figure 61, _b_, _c_, are normal forms of\r\nthe cycle sign; and the glyph in _a_ of the same figure, except for its\r\nsuperfixial element, is similarly the head variant for the cycle. It would\r\nseem, therefore, that the determining characteristics of these three glyphs\r\nmust be their superfixial elements. In the normal form in figure 61, _b_,\r\nthe superfix is very clear. Just inside the outline and parallel to it\r\nthere is a line of smaller circles, {119} and in the middle there are two\r\ninfixes like shepherds' crooks facing away from the center (). In _c_ of\r\nthe last-mentioned figure the superfix is of the same size and shape, and\r\nalthough it is partially destroyed the left-hand \"shepherd's crook\" can\r\nstill be distinguished. A faint dot treatment around the edge can also\r\nstill be traced. Although the superfix of the head variant in _a_ is\r\nsomewhat weathered, enough remains to show that it was similar to, if\r\nindeed not identical with, the superfixes of the normal forms in _b_ and c.\r\nThe line of circles defining the left side of this superfix, as well as\r\ntraces of the lower ends of the two \"shepherd's crook\" infixes, appears\r\nvery clearly in the lower part of the superfix. Moreover, in general shape\r\nand proportions this element is so similar to the corresponding elements in\r\nfigure 61, _b_, _c_, that, taken together with the similarity of the other\r\ndetails pointed out above, it seems more than likely that all three of\r\nthese superfixes are one and the same element. The points which have led\r\nthe writer to identify glyphs _a_, _b_, and _c_ in figure 61 as forms for\r\nthe great cycle, or period of the sixth order, may be summarized as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n1. All three of these glyphs, head-variant as well as normal forms, are\r\nmade up of the corresponding forms of the cycle sign plus another element,\r\na superfix, which is probably the determining characteristic in each case.\r\n\r\n2. All three of these superfixes are probably identical, thus showing that\r\nthe three glyphs in which they occur are probably variants of the same\r\nsign.\r\n\r\n3. All three of these glyphs occur in numerical series, the preceding term\r\nof which in each case is a cycle sign, thus showing that by position they\r\nare the logical \"next\" term (the sixth) of the series.\r\n\r\nLet us next examine the two texts in which great-great-cycle glyphs may\r\noccur. (See figs. 59, 60.) The two glyphs which may possibly be identified\r\nas the sign for this period are shown in figure 61, _d_, e.\r\n\r\nA comparison of these two forms shows that both are composed of the same\r\nelements: (1) The cycle sign; (2) a superfix in which the hand is the\r\nprincipal element.\r\n\r\nThe superfix in figure 61, _d_, consists of a hand and a tassel-like\r\npostfix, not unlike the upper half of the ending signs in figure 37, _l-q_.\r\nHowever, in the present case, if we accept the hypothesis that _d_ of\r\nfigure 61 is the sign for the great-great cycle, we are obliged to see in\r\nits superfix alone the essential _element_ of the great-great-cycle sign,\r\nsince the _rest_ of this glyph (the lower part) is quite clearly the normal\r\nform for the cycle.\r\n\r\nThe superfix in figure 61, _e_, consists of the same two elements as the\r\nabove, with the slight difference that the hand in _e_ holds a rod. Indeed,\r\nthe similarity of the two forms is so close that in default of {120} any\r\nevidence to the contrary the writer believes they may be accepted as signs\r\nfor one and the same period, namely, the great-great cycle.\r\n\r\nThe points on which this conclusion is based may be summarized as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Both glyphs are made up of the same elements--(_a_) The normal form of\r\nthe cycle sign; (_b_) a superfix composed of a hand with a tassel-like\r\npostfix.\r\n\r\n2. Both glyphs occur in numerical series the next term but one of which is\r\nthe cycle, showing that by position they are the logical next term but one,\r\nthe seventh or great-great cycle, of the series.\r\n\r\n3. Both of these glyphs stand next to glyphs which have been identified as\r\ngreat-cycle signs, that is, the sixth terms of the series in which they\r\noccur.\r\n\r\nBy this same line of reasoning it seems probable that A2 in figure 60 is\r\nthe sign for the great-great-great cycle, although this fact can not be\r\ndefinitely established because of the lack of comparative evidence.\r\n\r\nThis possible sign for the great-great-great cycle, or period of the 8th\r\norder, is composed of two parts, just like the signs for the great cycle\r\nand the great-great cycle already described. These are: (1) The cycle sign;\r\n(2) a superfix composed of a hand and a semicircular postfix, quite\r\ndistinct from the superfixes of the great cycle and great-great cycle\r\nsigns.\r\n\r\nHowever, since there is no other inscription known which presents a number\r\ncomposed of eight terms, we must lay aside this line of investigation and\r\nturn to another for further light on this point.\r\n\r\nAn examination of figure 60 shows that the glyphs which we have identified\r\nas the signs for the higher periods (A2, A3, A4, and A5,) contain one\r\nelement common to all--the sign for the cycle, or period of 144,000 days.\r\nIndeed, A5 is composed of this sign alone with its usual coefficient of 9.\r\nMoreover, the next glyphs (A6, A7, A8, and A9[83]) are the signs for the\r\nkatun, tun, uinal, and kin, respectively, and, together with A5, form a\r\nregular descending series of 5 terms, all of which are of known value.\r\n\r\nThe next question is, How is this glyph in the sixth place formed? We have\r\nseen that in the only three texts in which more than five periods are\r\nrecorded this sign for the sixth period is composed of the same elements in\r\neach: (1) The cycle sign; (2) a superfix containing two \"shepherd's crook\"\r\ninfixes and surrounded by dots.\r\n\r\nFurther, we have seen that in two cases in the inscriptions the cycle sign\r\nhas a coefficient greater than 13, thus showing that in all probability 20,\r\nnot 13, cycles made 1 great cycle.\r\n\r\nTherefore, since the great-cycle signs in figure 61, _a-c_, are composed of\r\nthe cycle sign plus a superfix (), this superfix must have the value of 20\r\nin order to make the whole glyph have the value of {121} 20 cycles, or 1\r\ngreat cycle (that is, 20 × 144,000 = 2,880,000). In other words, it may be\r\naccepted (1) that the glyphs in figure 61, _a-c_, are signs for the great\r\ncycle, or period of the sixth place; and (2) that the great cycle was\r\ncomposed of 20 cycles shown graphically by two elements, one being the\r\ncycle sign itself and the other a superfix having the value of 20.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown that the last six glyphs in figure 60 (A4, A5, A6, A7,\r\nA8, and A9) all belong to the same series. Let us next examine the seventh\r\nglyph or term from the bottom (A3) and see how it is formed. We have seen\r\nthat in the only two texts in which more than six periods are recorded the\r\nsigns for the seventh period (see fig. 61, _d_, _e_) are composed of the\r\nsame elements in each: (1) The cycle sign; (2) a superfix having the hand\r\nas its principal element. We have seen, further, that in the only three\r\nplaces in which great cycles are recorded in the Maya writing (fig. 61,\r\n_a-c_) the coefficient in every case is greater than 13, thus showing that\r\nin all probability 20, not 13, great cycles made 1 great-great cycle.\r\n\r\nTherefore, since the great-great cycle signs in figure 61, _d_, _e_, are\r\ncomposed of the cycle sign plus a superfix (), this superfix must have the\r\nvalue of 400 (20 × 20) in order to make the whole glyph have the value of\r\n20 great cycles, or 1 great-great cycle (20 × 2,880,000 = 57,600,000). In\r\nother words, it seems highly probable (1) that the glyphs in figure 61,\r\n_d_, _e_, are signs for the great-great cycle or period of the seventh\r\nplace, and (2) that the great-great cycle was composed of 20 great cycles,\r\nshown graphically by two elements, one being the cycle sign itself and the\r\nother a hand having the value of 400.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown that the first seven glyphs (A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, and\r\nA9) probably all belong to the same series. Let us next examine the eighth\r\nterm (A2) and see how it is formed.\r\n\r\nAs stated above, comparative evidence can help us no further, since the\r\ntext under discussion is the only one which presents a number composed of\r\nmore than seven terms. Nevertheless, the writer believes it will be\r\npossible to show by the morphology of this, the only glyph which occupies\r\nthe position of an eighth term, that it is 20 times the glyph in the\r\nseventh position, and consequently that the vigesimal system was perfect to\r\nthe highest known unit found in the Maya writing.\r\n\r\nWe have seen (1) that the sixth term was composed of the fifth term plus a\r\nsuperfix which increased the fifth 20 times, and (2) that the seventh term\r\nwas composed of the fifth term plus a superfix which increased the fifth\r\n400 times, or the sixth 20 times.\r\n\r\nNow let us examine the only known example of a sign for the eighth term\r\n(A2, fig. 60). This glyph is composed of (1) the cycle sign; (2) a superfix\r\nof two elements, (_a_) the hand, and (_b_) a semicircular element in which\r\ndots appear. {122}\r\n\r\nBut this same hand in the super-fix of the great-great cycle increased the\r\ncycle sign 400 times (20 × 20; see A3, fig. 60). Therefore we must assume\r\nthe same condition obtains here. And finally, since the eighth term = 20 ×\r\n20 × 20 × cycle, we must recognize in the second element of the superfix ()\r\na sign which means 20.\r\n\r\nA close study of this element shows that it has two important points of\r\nresemblance to the superfix of the great-cycle glyph (see A4, fig. 60),\r\nwhich was shown to have the value 20: (1) Both elements have the same\r\noutline, roughly semicircular; (2) both elements have the same chain of\r\ndots around their edges.\r\n\r\nCompare this element in A2, figure 60, with the superfixes in figure 61,\r\n_a_, _b_, bearing in mind that there is more than 275 years' difference in\r\ntime between the carving of A2, figure 60, and _a_, figure 61, and more\r\nthan 200 years between the former and figure 61, b. The writer believes\r\nboth are variants of the same element, and consequently A2, figure 60, is\r\nprobably composed of elements which signify 20 × 400 (20 × 20) × the cycle,\r\nwhich equals one great-great-great cycle, or term of the eighth place.\r\n\r\nThus on the basis of the glyphs themselves it seems possible to show that\r\nall belong to one and the same numerical series, which progresses according\r\nto the terms of a vigesimal system of numeration.\r\n\r\nThe several points supporting this conclusion may be summarized as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The eight periods[84] in figure 60 are consecutive, their sequence being\r\nuninterrupted throughout. Consequently it seems probable that all belong to\r\none and the same number.\r\n\r\n2. It has been shown that the highest three period glyphs are composed of\r\nelements which multiply the cycle sign by 20, 400, and 8,000, respectively,\r\nwhich has to be the case if they are the sixth, seventh, and eighth terms,\r\nrespectively, of the Maya vigesimal system of numeration.\r\n\r\n3. The highest three glyphs have numerical coefficients, just like the five\r\nlower ones; this tends to show that all eight are terms of the same\r\nnumerical series.\r\n\r\n4. In the two texts which alone can furnish comparative data for this sixth\r\nterm, the sixth-period glyph in each is identical with A4, figure 60, thus\r\nshowing the existence of a sixth period in the inscriptions and a\r\ngenerally[85] accepted sign for it.\r\n\r\n5. In the only other text which can furnish comparative data for the\r\nseventh term, the period glyph in its seventh place is identical {123} with\r\nA3, figure 60; thus showing the existence of a seventh period in the\r\ninscriptions and a generally accepted sign for it.\r\n\r\n6. The one term higher than the cycle in the Copan text, the two terms\r\nhigher in the Palenque text, and the three terms higher in this text, are\r\nall built on the same basic element, the cycle, thus showing that in each\r\ncase the higher term or terms is a continuation of the same number, not a\r\nPeriod-ending date, as suggested by Mr. Goodman for the Copan text.\r\n\r\n7. The other two texts, showing series composed of more than five terms,\r\nhave all their period glyphs in an unbroken sequence in each, like the text\r\nunder discussion, thus showing that in each of these other two texts all\r\nthe terms present probably belong to one and the same number.\r\n\r\n8. Finally, the two occurrences of the cycle sign with a coefficient above\r\n13, and the three occurrences of the great-cycle sign with a coefficient\r\nabove 13, indicate that 20, not 13, was the unit of progression in the\r\nhigher numbers in the inscriptions just as it was in the codices.\r\n\r\nBefore closing the discussion of this unique inscription, there is one\r\nother important point in connection with it which must be considered,\r\nbecause of its possible bearing on the meaning of the Initial-series\r\nintroducing glyph.\r\n\r\nThe first five glyphs on the east side of Stela 10 at Tikal are not\r\nillustrated in figure 60. The sixth glyph is A1 in figure 60, and the\r\nremaining glyphs in this figure carry the text to the bottom of this side\r\nof the monument. The first of these five unfigured glyphs is very clearly\r\nan Initial-series introducing glyph. Of this there can be no doubt. The\r\nsecond resembles the day 8 Manik, though it is somewhat effaced. The\r\nremaining three are unknown. The next glyph, A1, figure 60, is very clearly\r\nanother Initial-series introducing glyph, having all of the five elements\r\ncommon to that sign. Compare A1 with the forms for the Initial series\r\nintroducing glyph in figure 24. This certainly would seem to indicate that\r\nan Initial Series is to follow. Moreover, the fourth glyph of the\r\neight-term number following in A2-A9, inclusive (that is, A5), records\r\n\"Cycle 9,\" the cycle in which practically all Initial-series dates fall.\r\nIndeed, if A2, A3, and A4 were omitted and A5, A6, A7, A8, and A9 were\r\nrecorded immediately after A1, the record would be that of a regular\r\nInitial-series number (9.3.6.2.0). Can this be a matter of chance? If not,\r\nwhat effect can A2, A3, and A4 have on the Initial-series date in A1,\r\nA5-A9?\r\n\r\nThe writer believes that the only possible effect they could have would be\r\nto fix Cycle 9 of Maya chronology in a far more comprehensive and elaborate\r\nchronological conception, a conception which {124} indeed staggers the\r\nimagination, dealing as it does with more than five million years.\r\n\r\nIf these eight terms all belong to one and the same numerical series, a\r\nfact the writer believes he has established in the foregoing pages, it\r\nmeans that Cycle 9, the first historic period of the Maya civilization, was\r\nCycle 9 of Great Cycle 19 of Great-great Cycle 11 of Great-great-great\r\nCycle 1. In other words, the starting point of Maya chronology, which we\r\nhave seen was the date 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu, 9 cycles before the close of a Cycle\r\n9, was in reality 1. 11. 19. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu, or simply a\r\nfixed point in a far vaster chronological conception.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it proves, as contended by the writer on page 113, that a\r\ngreat cycle came to an end on this date, 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu. This is true\r\nbecause on the above date (1. 11. 19. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu) all\r\nthe five periods lower than the great cycle are at 0. It proves,\r\nfurthermore, as the writer also contended, that the date 4 Ahau 8 Zotz, 13\r\ncycles in advance of the date 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu, did not end a great cycle--\r\n\r\n  1. 11. 19.  0. 0. 0. 0. 0.    4 Ahau 8 Cumhu\r\n             13. 0. 0. 0. 0.\r\n  1. 11. 18.  7. 0. 0. 0. 0.    4 Ahau 8 Zotz\r\n\r\nbut, on the contrary, was a Cycle 7 of Great Cycle 18, the end of which\r\n(19. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu) was the starting point of Maya\r\nchronology.\r\n\r\nIt seems to the writer that the above construction is the only one that can\r\nbe put on this text if we admit that the eight periods in A2-A9, figure 60,\r\nall belong to one and the same numerical series.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it would show that the great cycle in which fell the first\r\nhistoric period of the Maya civilization (Cycle 9) was itself the closing\r\ngreat cycle of a great-great cycle, namely, Great-great Cycle 11:\r\n\r\n  1. 11. 19. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.\r\n          1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.\r\n  1. 12.  0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.\r\n\r\nThat is to say, that when Great Cycle 19 had completed itself, Great-great\r\nCycle 12 would be ushered in.\r\n\r\nWe have seen on pages 108-113 that the names of the cycles followed one\r\nanother in this sequence: Cycle 1, Cycle 2, Cycle 3, etc., to Cycle 13,\r\nwhich was followed by Cycle 1, and the sequence repeated itself. We saw,\r\nhowever, that these names probably had nothing to do with the positions of\r\nthe cycles in the great cycle; that on the contrary these numbers were\r\nnames and not positions in a higher term.\r\n\r\nNow we have seen that Maya chronology began with a Cycle 1; that is, it was\r\ncounted from the end of a Cycle 13. Therefore, the {125} closing cycle of\r\nGreat Cycle 19 of Great-great Cycle 11 of Great-great-great Cycle 1 was a\r\nCycle 13, that is to say, 1. 11. 19. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 4 Ahau 13 Cumhu\r\nconcluded a great cycle, the closing cycle of which was named Cycle 13.\r\nThis large number, composed of _one_ great-great-great cycle, _eleven_\r\ngreat-great cycles, and _nineteen_ great cycles, contains exactly 12,780\r\ncycles, as below:\r\n\r\n  1 great-great-great cycle = 1 × 20 × 20 × 20 cycles = 8,000 cycles\r\n  11 great-great cycles     = 11 × 20 × 20 cycles     = 4,400 cycles\r\n  19 great cycles           = 19 × 20 cycles          =   380 cycles\r\n                                                        -----\r\n                                                       12,780 cycles\r\n\r\nBut the closing cycle of this number was named Cycle 13, and by deducting\r\nall the multiples of 13 possible (983) we can find the name of the first\r\ncycle of Great-great-great Cycle 1, the highest Maya time period of which\r\nwe have any knowledge: 983 × 13 = 12,779. And deducting this from the\r\nnumber of cycles involved (12,780), we have--\r\n\r\n  12,780\r\n  12,779\r\n  ------\r\n       1\r\n\r\nThis counted backward from Cycle 1, brings us again to a Cycle 13 as the\r\nname of the first cycle in the Maya conception of time. In other words, the\r\nMaya conceived time to have commenced, in so far as we can judge from the\r\nsingle record available, with a Cycle 13, not with the beginning of a Cycle\r\n1, as they did their chronology.\r\n\r\nWe have still to explain A1, figure 60. This glyph is quite clearly a form\r\nof the Initial-series introducing glyph, as already explained, in which the\r\nfive components of that glyph are present in usual form: (1) Trinal\r\nsuperfix; (2) pair of comb-like lateral appendages; (3) the tun sign; (4)\r\nthe trinal subfix; (5) the variable central element, here represented by a\r\ngrotesque head.\r\n\r\nOf these, the first only claims our attention here. The trinal superfix in\r\nA1 (fig. 60), as its name signifies, is composed of three parts, but,\r\nunlike other forms of this element, the middle part seems to be nothing\r\nmore nor less than a numerical dot or 1. The question at once arises, can\r\nthe two flanking parts be merely ornamental and the whole element stand for\r\nthe number 1? The introducing glyph at the beginning of this text (not\r\nfigured here), so far as it can be made out, has a trinal superfix of\r\nexactly the same character--a dot with an ornamental scroll on each side.\r\nWhat can be the explanation of this element, and indeed of the whole glyph?\r\nIs it one great-great-great-great cycle--a period twenty times as great as\r\nthe one recorded in A2, or is it not a term of the series in glyphs A2-A9?\r\n{126} The writer believes that whatever it may be, it is at least _not_ a\r\nmember of this series, and in support of his belief he suggests that if it\r\nwere, why should it alone be retained in recording _all_ Initial-series\r\ndates, whereas the other three--the great-great-great cycle, the\r\ngreat-great cycle, and the great-cycle signs--have disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe following explanation, the writer believes, satisfactorily accounts for\r\nall of these points, though it is advanced here only by way of suggestion\r\nas a possible solution of the meaning of the Initial-series introducing\r\nglyph. It is suggested that in A1 we may have a sign representing\r\n\"eternity,\" \"this world,\" \"time\"; that is to say, a sign denoting the\r\nduration of the present world-epoch, the epoch of which the Maya\r\ncivilization occupied only a small part. The middle dot of the upper\r\nelement, being 1, denotes that this world-epoch is the first, or present,\r\none, and the whole glyph itself might mean \"the present world.\" The\r\nappropriateness of such a glyph ushering in every Initial-series date is\r\napparent. It signified time in general, while the succeeding 7 glyphs\r\ndenoted what particular day of time was designated in the inscription.\r\n\r\nBut why, even admitting the correctness of this interpretation of A1,\r\nshould the great-great-great cycle, the great-great cycle, and the great\r\ncycle of their chronological scheme be omitted, and Initial-series dates\r\nalways open with this glyph, which signifies time in general, followed by\r\nthe current cycle? The answer to this question, the writer believes, is\r\nthat the cycle was the greatest period with which the Maya could have had\r\nactual experience. It will be shown in Chapter V that there are a few\r\nCycle-8 dates actually recorded, as well as a half a dozen Cycle-10 dates.\r\nThat is, the cycle, which changed its coefficient every 400 years, was a\r\nperiod which they could _not_ regard as never changing within the range of\r\nhuman experience. On the other hand, it was the shortest period of which\r\nthey were uncertain, since the great cycle could change its coefficient\r\nonly every 8,000 years--practically eternity so far as the Maya were\r\nconcerned. Therefore it could be omitted as well as the two higher periods\r\nin a date without giving rise to confusion as to which great cycle was the\r\ncurrent one. The cycle, on the contrary, had to be given, as its\r\ncoefficient changed every 400 years, and the Maya are known to have\r\nrecorded dates in at least three cycles--Nos. 8, 9, and 10. Hence, it was\r\nGreat Cycle 19 for 8,000 years, Great-great Cycle 11 for 160,000, and\r\nGreat-great-great Cycle 1 for 3,200,000 years, whereas it was Cycle 9 for\r\nonly 400 years. This, not the fact that the Maya never had a period higher\r\nthan the cycle, the writer believes was the reason why the three higher\r\nperiods were omitted from Initial-series dates--they were unnecessary so\r\nfar as accuracy was concerned, since there could never be any doubt\r\nconcerning them. {127}\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to press this point further, though it is believed the\r\nforegoing conception of time had actually been worked out by the Maya. The\r\narchaic date recorded by Stela 10 at Tikal (9.3.6.2.0) makes this monument\r\none of the very oldest in the Maya territory; indeed, there is only one\r\nother stela which has an earlier Initial Series, Stela 3 at Tikal. In the\r\narchaic period from which this monument dates the middle dot of the trinal\r\nsuperfix in the Initial-series introducing glyph may still have retained\r\nits numerical value, 1, but in later times this middle dot lost its\r\nnumerical characteristics and frequently appears as a scroll itself.\r\n\r\nThe early date of Stela 10 makes it not unlikely that this process of glyph\r\nelaboration may not have set in at the time it was erected, and\r\nconsequently that we have in this simplified trinal element the genesis of\r\nthe later elaborated form; and, finally, that A1, figure 60, may have meant\r\n\"the present world-epoch\" or something similar.\r\n\r\nIn concluding the presentation of these three numbers the writer may\r\nexpress the opinion that a careful study of the period glyphs in figures\r\n58-60 will lead to the following conclusions: (1) That the six periods\r\nrecorded in the first, the seven in the second, and the eight or nine in\r\nthe third, all belong to the same series in each case; and (2) that\r\nthroughout the six terms of the first, the seven of the second, and the\r\neight of the third, the series in each case conforms strictly to the\r\nvigesimal system of numeration given in Table VIII.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned on page 116 (footnote 2), in this method of recording the\r\nhigher numbers the kin sign may sometimes be omitted without affecting the\r\nnumerical value of the series wherein the omission occurs. In such cases\r\nthe coefficient of the kin sign is usually prefixed to the uinal sign, the\r\ncoefficient of the uinal itself standing above the uinal sign. In figure\r\n58, for example, the uinal and the kin coefficients are both 0. In this\r\ncase, however, the 0 on the left of the uinal sign is to be understood as\r\nbelonging to the kin sign, which is omitted, while the 0 above the uinal\r\nsign is the uinal's own coefficient 0. Again in figure 59, the kin sign is\r\nomitted and the kin coefficient 1 is prefixed to the uinal sign, while the\r\nuinal's own coefficient 12 stands above the uinal sign. Similarly, the 12\r\nuinals and 17 kins recorded in figure 56, _d_, might as well have been\r\nwritten as in _o_ of the same figure, that is, with the kin sign omitted\r\nand its coefficient 17 prefixed to the uinal sign, while the uinal's own\r\ncoefficient 12 appears above. Or again, the 9 uinals and 18 kins recorded\r\nin _f_ also might have been written as in _p_, that is, with the kin sign\r\nomitted and the kin coefficient 18 prefixed to the uinal sign while the\r\nuinal's own coefficient 9 appears above.\r\n\r\nIn all the above examples the coefficients of the omitted kin signs are on\r\nthe _left_ of the uinal signs, while the uinal coefficients are _above_ the\r\nuinal signs. Sometimes, however, these positions are reversed, {128} and\r\nthe uinal coefficient stands _on the left_ of the uinal sign, while the kin\r\ncoefficient stands _above_. This interchange in certain cases probably\r\nresulted from the needs of glyphic balance and symmetry. For example, in\r\nfigure 62, _a_, had the kin coefficient 19 been placed on the left of the\r\nuinal sign, the uinal coefficient 4 would have been insufficient to fill\r\nthe space above the period glyph, and consequently the corner of the glyph\r\nblock would have appeared ragged. The use of the 19 _above_ and the 4 to\r\nthe left, on the other hand, properly fills this space, making a\r\nsymmetrical glyph. Such cases, however, are unusual, and the customary\r\nposition of the kin coefficient, when the kin sign is omitted, is on the\r\nleft of the uinal sign, not above it. This practice, namely, omitting the\r\nkin sign in numerical series, seems to have prevailed extensively in\r\nconnection with both Initial Series and Secondary Series; indeed, in the\r\nlatter it is the rule to which there are but few exceptions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 62. Glyphs showing misplacement of the kin coefficient\r\n(_a_) or elimination of a period glyph (_b_, _c_): _a_, Stela E, Quirigua;\r\n_b_, Altar U, Copan; _c_, Stela J, Copan.]\r\n\r\nThe omission of the kin sign, while by far the most common, is not the only\r\nexample of glyph omission found in numerical series in the inscriptions.\r\nSometimes, though very rarely, numbers occur in which periods other than\r\nthe kin are wanting. A case in point is figure 62, b. Here a tun sign\r\nappears with the coefficient 13 above and 3 to the left. Since there are\r\nonly two coefficients (13 and 3) and three time periods (tun, uinal, and\r\nkin), it is clear that the signs of both the lower periods have been\r\nomitted as well as the coefficient of one of them. In _c_ of the\r\nlast-mentioned figure a somewhat different practice was followed. Here,\r\nalthough three time periods are recorded--tuns, uinals and kins--one period\r\n(the uinal) and its coefficient have been omitted, and there is nothing\r\nbetween the 0 kins and 10 tuns. Such cases are exceedingly rare, however,\r\nand may be disregarded by the beginner.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the order of the periods in the numbers in figure 56 was\r\njust the reverse of that in the numbers shown in figures 58 and 59; that in\r\none place the kins stand at the top and in the other at the bottom; and\r\nfinally, that this difference was not a vital one, since it had no effect\r\non the values of the numbers. This is true, because in the first method of\r\nexpressing the higher numbers, it matters not which end of the number comes\r\nfirst, the highest or the {129} lowest period, so long as its several\r\nperiods always stand in the same relation to each other. For example, in\r\nfigure 56, _q_, 6 cycles, 17 katuns, 2 tuns, 10 uinals, and 0 kins\r\nrepresent exactly the same number as 0 kins, 10 uinals, 2 tuns, 17 katuns,\r\nand 6 cycles; that is, with the lowest term first.\r\n\r\nIt was explained on page 23 that the order in which the glyphs are to be\r\nread is from top to bottom and from left to right. Applying this rule to\r\nthe inscriptions, the student will find that all Initial Series are\r\ndescending series; that in reading from top to bottom and left to right,\r\nthe cycles will be encountered first, the katuns next, the tuns next, the\r\nuinals, and the kins last. Moreover, it will be found also that the great\r\nmajority of Secondary Series are ascending series, that is, in reading from\r\ntop to bottom and left to right, the kins will be encountered first, the\r\nuinals next, the tuns next, the katuns next, and the cycles last. The\r\nreason why Initial Series always should be presented as descending series,\r\nand Secondary Series usually as ascending series is unknown; though as\r\nstated above, the order in either case might have been reversed without\r\naffecting in any way the numerical value of either series.\r\n\r\nThis concludes the discussion of the first method of expressing the higher\r\nnumbers, the only method which has been found in the inscriptions.\r\n\r\nSECOND METHOD OF NUMERATION\r\n\r\nThe other method by means of which the Maya expressed their higher numbers\r\n(the second method given on p. 103) may be called \"numeration by position,\"\r\nsince in this method the numerical value of the symbols depended solely on\r\nposition, just as in our own decimal system, in which the value of a figure\r\ndepends on its distance from the decimal point, whole numbers being written\r\nto the left and fractions to the right. The ratio of increase, as the word\r\n\"decimal\" implies, is 10 throughout, and the numerical values of the\r\nconsecutive positions increase as they recede from the decimal point in\r\neach direction, according to the terms of a geometrical progression. For\r\nexample, in the number 8888.0, the second 8 from the decimal point,\r\ncounting from right to left, has a value ten times greater than the first\r\n8, since it stands for 8 tens (80); the third 8 from the decimal point\r\nsimilarly has a value ten times greater than the second 8, since it stands\r\nfor 8 hundreds (800); finally, the fourth 8 has a value ten times greater\r\nthan the third 8, since it stands for 8 thousands (8,000). Hence, although\r\nthe figures used are the same in each case, each has a different numerical\r\nvalue, depending solely upon its position with reference to the decimal\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nIn the second method of writing their numbers the Maya had devised a\r\nsomewhat similar notation. Their ratio of increase was 20 in all positions\r\nexcept the third. The value of these positions increased {130} with their\r\ndistance from the bottom, according to the terms of the vigesimal system\r\nshown in Table VIII. This second method, or \"numeration by position,\" as it\r\nmay be called, was a distinct advance over the first, since it required for\r\nits expression only the signs for the numerals 0 to 19, inclusive, and did\r\nnot involve the use of any period glyphs, as did the first method. To its\r\ngreater brevity, no doubt, may be ascribed its use in the codices, where\r\nnumerical calculations running into numbers of 5 and 6 terms form a large\r\npart of the subject matter. It should be remembered that in numeration by\r\nposition only the normal forms of the numbers--bar and dot numerals--are\r\nused. This probably results from the fact that head-variant numerals never\r\noccur independently, but are always prefixed to some other glyph, as\r\nperiod, day, or month signs (see p. 104). Since no period glyphs are used\r\nin numeration by position, only normal-form numerals, that is, bar and dot\r\nnumerals, can appear.\r\n\r\nThe numbers from 1 to 19, inclusive, are expressed in this method, as shown\r\nin figure 39, and the number 0 as shown in figure 46. As all of these\r\nnumbers are below 20, they are expressed as units of the first place or\r\norder, and consequently each should be regarded as having been multiplied\r\nby 1, the numerical value of the first or lowest position.\r\n\r\nThe number 20 was expressed in two different ways: (1) By the sign shown in\r\nfigure 45; and (2) by the numeral 0 in the bottom place and the numeral 1\r\nin the next place above it, as in figure 63, a. The first of these had only\r\na very restricted use in connection with the tonalamatl, wherein numeration\r\nby position was impossible, and therefore a special character for 20 (see\r\nfig. 45) was necessary. See Chapter VI.\r\n\r\nThe numbers from 21 to 359, inclusive, involved the use of two places--the\r\nkin place and the uinal place--which, according to Table VIII, we saw had\r\nnumerical values of 1 and 20, respectively. For example, the number 37 was\r\nexpressed as shown in figure 63, b. The 17 in the kin place has a value of\r\n17 (17 × 1) and the 1 in the uinal, or second, place a value of 20 (1 (the\r\nnumeral) × 20 (the fixed numerical value of the second place)). The sum of\r\nthese two products equals 37. Again, 300 was written as in figure 63, c.\r\nThe 0 in the kin place has the value 0 (0 × 1), and the 15 in the second\r\nplace has the value of 300 (15 × 20), and the sum of these products equals\r\n300.\r\n\r\nTo express the numbers 360 to 7,199, inclusive, three places or terms were\r\nnecessary--kins, uinals, and tuns--of which the last had a numerical value\r\nof 360. (See Table VIII.) For example, the number 360 is shown in figure\r\n63, d. The 0 in the lowest place indicates that 0 kins are involved, the 0\r\nin the second place indicates that 0 uinals or 20's are involved, while the\r\n1 in the third place shows that there is 1 tun, or 360, kins recorded (1\r\n(the numeral) × 360 (the fixed numerical value of the third position)); the\r\nsum of these three products equals 360. Again, the number 7,113 is\r\nexpressed as shown in figure 63, e. {131} The 13 in the lowest place equals\r\n13 (13 × 1); the 13 in the second place, 260 (13 × 20); and the 19 in the\r\nthird place, 6,840 (19 × 360). The sum of these three products equals 7,113\r\n(13 + 260 + 6,840),\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 63. Examples of the second method of numeration, used\r\nexclusively in the codices.]\r\n\r\nThe numbers from 7,200 to 143,999, inclusive, involved the use of four\r\nplaces or terms--kins, uinals, tuns, and katuns--the last of which (the\r\nfourth place) had a numerical value of 7,200. (See Table VIII.) For\r\nexample, the number 7,202 is recorded in figure 63, _f_. {132} The 2 in the\r\nfirst place equals 2 (2×1); the 0 in the second place, 0 (0×20); the 0 in\r\nthe third place, 0 (0×360); and the 1 in the fourth place, 7,200 (1×7,200).\r\nThe sum of these four products equals 7,202 (2+0+0+7,200). Again, the\r\nnumber 100,932 is recorded in figure 63, _g_. Here the 12 in the first\r\nplace equals 12 (12×1); the 6 in the second place, 120 (6×20); the 0 in the\r\nthird place, 0 (0×360); and the 14 in the fourth place, 100,800 (14×7,200).\r\nThe sum of these four products equals 100,932 (12+120+0+100,800).\r\n\r\nThe numbers from 144,000 to 2,879,999, inclusive, involved the use of five\r\nplaces or terms--kins, uinals, tuns, katuns, and cycles. The last of these\r\n(the fifth place) had a numerical value of 144,000. (See Table VIII.) For\r\nexample, the number 169,200 is recorded in figure 63, _h_. The 0 in the\r\nfirst place equals 0 (0×1); the 0 in the second place, 0 (0×20); the 10 in\r\nthe third place, 3,600 (10×360); the 3 in the fourth place, 21,600\r\n(3×7,200); and the 1 in the fifth place, 144,000 (1×144,000). The sum of\r\nthese five products equals 169,200 (0+0+3,600+21,600+144,000). Again, the\r\nnumber 2,577,301 is recorded in figure 63, _i_. The 1 in the first place\r\nequals 1 (1×1); the 3 in the second place, 60 (3×20); the 19 in the third\r\nplace, 6,840 (19×360); the 17 in the fourth place, 122,400 (17×7,200); and\r\nthe 17 in the fifth place, 2,448,000 (17x144,000). The sum of these five\r\nproducts equals 2,577,301 (1+60+6,480+122,400+2,448,000).\r\n\r\nThe writing of numbers above 2,880,000 up to and including 12,489,781 (the\r\nhighest number found in the codices) involves the use of six places, or\r\nterms--kins, uinals, tuns, katuns, cycles, and great cycles--the last of\r\nwhich (the sixth place) has the numerical value 2,880,000. It will be\r\nremembered that some have held that the sixth place in the inscriptions\r\ncontained only 13 units of the fifth place, or 1,872,000 units of the first\r\nplace. In the codices, however, there are numerous calendric checks which\r\nprove conclusively that in so far as the codices are concerned the sixth\r\nplace was composed of 20 units of the fifth place. For example, the number\r\n5,832,060 is expressed as in figure 63, _j_. The 0 in the first place\r\nequals 0 (0×1); the 3 in the second place, 60 (3×20); the 0 in the third\r\nplace, 0 (0×360); the 10 in the fourth place, 72,000 (10×7,200); the 0 in\r\nthe fifth place, 0 (0×144,000); and the 2 in the sixth place, 5,760,000\r\n(2×2,880,000). The sum of these six terms equals 5,832,060\r\n(0+60+0+72,000+0+5,760,000). The highest number in the codices, as\r\nexplained above, is 12,489,781, which is recorded on page 61 of the Dresden\r\nCodex. This number is expressed as in figure 63, _k_. The 1 in the first\r\nplace equals 1 (1×1); the 15 in the second place, 300 (15×20); the 13 in\r\nthe third place, 4,680 (13×360); the 14 in the fourth place, 100,800\r\n(14×7,200); the 6 in the fifth place, 864,000 (6×144,000); and the 4 in the\r\nsixth place, 11,520,000 (4×2,880,000). The sum of these six products equals\r\n12,489,781 (1+300+4,680+100,800+864,000+11,520,000). {133}\r\n\r\nIt is clear that in numeration by position the order of the units could not\r\nbe reversed as in the first method without seriously affecting their\r\nnumerical values. This must be true, since in the second method the\r\nnumerical values of the numerals depend entirely on their position--that\r\nis, on their distance above the bottom or first term. In the first method,\r\nthe multiplicands--the period glyphs, each of which had a fixed numerical\r\nvalue--are always expressed[86] with their corresponding multipliers--the\r\nnumerals 0 to 19, inclusive; in other words, the period glyphs themselves\r\nshow whether the series is an ascending or a descending one. But in the\r\nsecond method the multiplicands are not expressed. Consequently, since\r\nthere is nothing about a column of bar and dot numerals which in itself\r\nindicates whether the series is an ascending or a descending one, and since\r\nin numeration by position a fixed starting point is absolutely essential,\r\nin their second method the Maya were obliged not only to fix arbitrarily\r\nthe direction of reading, as from bottom to top, but also to confine\r\nthemselves exclusively to the presentation of one kind of series only--that\r\nis, ascending series. Only by means of these two arbitrary rules was\r\nconfusion obviated in numeration by position.\r\n\r\nHowever dissimilar these two methods of representing the numbers may appear\r\nat first sight, fundamentally they are the same, since both have as their\r\nbasis the same vigesimal system of numeration. Indeed, it can not be too\r\nstrongly emphasized that throughout the range of the Maya writings,\r\ncodices, inscriptions, or Books of Chilam Balam[87] the several methods of\r\ncounting time and recording events found in each are all derived from the\r\nsame source, and all are expressions of the same numerical system.\r\n\r\nThat the student may better grasp the points of difference between the two\r\nmethods they are here contrasted:\r\n\r\nTABLE XII.

The next question which concerns us is, How did they use these\r\nnumbers in their calculations; or in other words, how was their arithmetic\r\napplied to their calendar? It may be said at the very outset in answer to\r\nthis question, that in so far as known, _numbers appear to have had but one\r\nuse throughout the Maya texts, namely, to express the time elapsing between\r\ndates_.[88] In the codices and the inscriptions alike all the numbers whose\r\nuse is understood have been found to deal exclusively with the counting of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThis highly specialized use of the numbers in Maya texts has determined the\r\nfirst step to be taken in the process of deciphering them. Since the\r\nprimary unit of the calendar was the day, all numbers should be reduced to\r\nterms of this unit, or in other words, to units of the first order, or\r\nplace.[89] Hence, we may accept the following as the _first step_ in\r\nascertaining the meaning of any number:\r\n\r\nFIRST STEP IN SOLVING MAYA NUMBERS\r\n\r\nReduce all the units of the higher orders to units of its first, or lowest,\r\norder, and then add the resulting quantities together.\r\n\r\nThe application of this rule to any Maya number, no matter of how many\r\nterms, will always give the actual number of primary units which it\r\ncontains, and in this form it can be more conveniently utilized in\r\nconnection with the calendar than if it were left as recorded, that is, in\r\nterms of its higher orders.\r\n\r\nThe reduction of units of the higher orders to units of the first order has\r\nbeen explained on pages 105-133, but in order to provide the student with\r\nthis same information in a more condensed and accessible form, it is\r\npresented in the following tables, of which Table XIII is to be used for\r\nreducing numbers to their primary units in the inscriptions, and Table XIV\r\nfor the same purpose in the codices. {135}\r\n\r\nTABLE XIII. VALUES OF HIGHER PERIODS IN TERMS OF LOWEST, IN INSCRIPTIONS\r\n\r\n  1 great cycle = [90]2,880,000\r\n  1       cycle         144,000\r\n  1       katun           7,200\r\n  1         tun             360\r\n  1       uinal              20\r\n  1         kin               1\r\n\r\nTABLE XIV. VALUES OF HIGHER PERIODS IN TERMS OF LOWEST, IN CODICES\r\n\r\n  1 unit of the 6th place = 2,880,000\r\n  1 unit of the 5th place     144,000\r\n  1 unit of the 4th place       7,200\r\n  1 unit of the 3d place          360\r\n  1 unit of the 2d place           20\r\n  1 unit of the 1st place           1\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered, in using these tables, that each of the signs for\r\nthe periods therein given has its own particular numerical value, and that\r\nthis value in each case is a multiplicand which is to be multiplied by the\r\nnumeral attached to it (not shown in Table XIII). For example, a 3 attached\r\nto the katun sign reduces to 21,600 units of the first order (3×7,200).\r\nAgain, 5 attached to the uinal sign reduces to 100 units of the first order\r\n(5×20). In using Table XIV, however, it should be remembered that the\r\nposition of a numeral multiplier determines at the same time that\r\nmultiplier's multiplicand. Thus a 5 in the third place indicates that the\r\n5's multiplicand is 360, the numerical value of the third place, and such a\r\nterm reduces to 1,800 units of the first place (5×360=1,800). Again, a 10\r\nin the fourth place indicates that the 10's multiplicand is 7,200, the\r\nnumerical value corresponding to the fourth place, and such a term reduces\r\nto 72,000 units of the first place.\r\n\r\nHaving reduced all the terms of a number to units of the 1st order, the\r\nnext step in finding out its meaning is to discover the date from which it\r\nis counted. This operation gives rise to the _second step_.\r\n\r\nSECOND STEP IN SOLVING MAYA NUMBERS\r\n\r\nFind the date from which the number is counted:\r\n\r\nThis is not always an easy matter, since the dates from which Maya numbers\r\nare counted are frequently not expressed in the texts; consequently, it is\r\nclear that no single rule can be formulated which will cover all cases.\r\nThere are, however, two general rules which will be found to apply to the\r\ngreat majority of numbers in the texts:\r\n\r\n_Rule 1._ When the starting point or date is expressed, usually, though not\r\ninvariably, it precedes[91] the number counted from it.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted, however, in connection with this rule, that the\r\nstarting date hardly ever immediately precedes the number from which it is\r\ncounted, but that several glyphs nearly always stand {136} between.[92]\r\nCertain exceptions to the above rule are by no means rare, and the student\r\nmust be continually on the lookout for such reversals of the regular order.\r\nThese exceptions are cases in which the starting date (1) follows the\r\nnumber counted from it, and (2) stands elsewhere in the text, entirely\r\ndisassociated from, and unattached to, the number counted from it.\r\n\r\nThe second of the above-mentioned general rules, covering the majority of\r\ncases, follows:\r\n\r\n_Rule 2_. When the starting point or date is not expressed, if the number\r\nis an Initial Series the date from which it should be counted will be found\r\nto be 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu.[93]\r\n\r\nThis rule is particularly useful in deciphering numbers in the\r\ninscriptions. For example, when the student finds a number which he can\r\nidentify as an Initial Series,[94] he may assume at once that such a number\r\nin all probability is counted from the date 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu, and proceed on\r\nthis assumption. The exceptions to this rule, that is, cases in which the\r\nstarting point is not expressed and the number is not an Initial Series,\r\nare not numerous. No rule can be given covering all such cases, and the\r\nstarting points of such numbers can be determined only by means of the\r\ncalculations given under the third and fourth steps, below.\r\n\r\nHaving determined the starting point or date from which a given number is\r\nto be counted (if this is possible), the next step is to find out which way\r\nthe count runs; that is, whether it is _forward_ from the starting point to\r\nsome _later date_, or whether it is _backward_ from the starting point to\r\nsome _earlier date_. This process may be called the _third step_.\r\n\r\nTHIRD STEP IN SOLVING MAYA NUMBERS\r\n\r\nAscertain whether the number is to be counted forward or backward from its\r\nstarting point.\r\n\r\nIt may be said at the very outset in this connection that the overwhelming\r\nmajority of Maya numbers are counted _forward_ from their starting points\r\nand not backward. In other words, they proceed from _earlier to later\r\ndates_ and not vice versa. Indeed, the preponderance of the former is so\r\ngreat, and the exceptions are so rare, that the student should always\r\nproceed on the postulate that the count is forward until proved definitely\r\nto be otherwise. {137}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 64. Figure showing the use of the \"minus\" or \"backward\"\r\nsign in the codices.]\r\n\r\nIn the codices, moreover, when the count is backward, or contrary to the\r\ngeneral practice, the fact is clearly indicated[95] by a special character.\r\nThis character, although attached only to the lowest term[96] of the number\r\nwhich is to be counted backward, is to be interpreted as applying to all\r\nthe other terms as well, its effect extending to the number as a whole.\r\nThis \"backward sign\" (shown in fig. 64) is a circle drawn in red around the\r\nlowest term of the number which it affects, and is surmounted by a knot of\r\nthe same color. An example covering the use of this sign is given in figure\r\n64. Although the \"backward sign\" in this figure surrounds only the numeral\r\nin the first place, 0, it is to be interpreted, as we have seen, as\r\napplying to the 2 in the second place and the 6 in the third place. This\r\nnumber, expressed as 6 tuns, 2 uinals, and 0 kins, reduces to 2,200 units\r\nof the first place, and in this form may be more readily handled (first\r\nstep). Since the starting point usually precedes the number counted from it\r\nand since in figure 64 the number is expressed by the second method, its\r\nstarting point will be found standing below it. This follows from the fact\r\nthat in numeration by position the order is from bottom to top. Therefore\r\nthe starting point from which the 2,200 recorded in figure 64 is counted\r\nwill be found to be below it, that is, the date 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu[97] (second\r\nstep). Finally, the red circle and knot surrounding the lowest (0) term of\r\nthis 2,200 indicates that this number is to be counted _backward_ from its\r\nstarting point, not forward (third step).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in the inscriptions no special character seems to have\r\nbeen used with a number to indicate that it was to be counted backward; at\r\nleast no such sign has yet been discovered. In the inscriptions, therefore,\r\nwith the single exception[98] mentioned below, the student can only apply\r\nthe general rule given on page 136, that in the great majority of cases the\r\ncount is forward. This rule will be found to apply to at least nine out of\r\nevery ten numbers. The exception above noted, that is, where the practice\r\nis so uniform as to render possible the formulation of an unfailing rule,\r\nhas to do with Initial Series. This rule, to which there are no known\r\nexceptions, may be stated as follows:\r\n\r\n_Rule 1_. In Initial Series the count is _always forward_, and, in general\r\nthroughout the inscriptions. The very few cases in which the count _is_\r\nbackward, are confined chiefly to Secondary Series, and it is in {138}\r\ndealing with this kind of series that the student will find the greatest\r\nnumber of exceptions to the general rule.\r\n\r\nHaving determined the direction of the count, whether it is forward or\r\nbackward, the next (_fourth_) step may be given.\r\n\r\nFOURTH STEP IN SOLVING MAYA NUMBERS\r\n\r\nTo count the number from its starting point.\r\n\r\nWe have come now to a step that involves the consideration of actual\r\narithmetical processes, which it is thought can be set forth much more\r\nclearly by the use of specific examples than by the statement of general\r\nrules. Hence, we will formulate our rules after the processes which they\r\ngovern have been fully explained.\r\n\r\nIn counting any number, as 31,741, or 4.8.3.1 as it would be expressed in\r\nMaya notation,[99] from any date, as 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu, there are four unknown\r\nelements which have to be determined before we can write the date which the\r\ncount reaches. These are:\r\n\r\n1. The day coefficient, which must be one of the numerals 1 to 13,\r\ninclusive.\r\n\r\n2. The day name, which must be one of the twenty given in Table I.\r\n\r\n3. The position of the day in some division of the year, which must be one\r\nof the numerals 0 to 19, inclusive.\r\n\r\n4. The name of the division of the year, which must be one of the nineteen\r\ngiven in Table III.\r\n\r\nThese four unknown elements all have to be determined from (1) the starting\r\ndate, and (2) the number which is to be counted from it.\r\n\r\nIf the student will constantly bear in mind that all Maya sequences,\r\nwhether the day coefficients, day signs, positions in the divisions of the\r\nyear, or what not, are absolutely continuous, repeating themselves without\r\nany break or interruption whatsoever, he will better understand the\r\ncalculations which follow.\r\n\r\nIt was explained in the text (see pp. 41-44) and also shown graphically in\r\nthe tonalamatl wheel (pl. 5) that after the day coefficients had reached\r\nthe number 13 they returned to 1, following each other indefinitely in this\r\norder without interruption. It is clear, therefore, that the highest\r\nmultiple of 13 which the given number contains may be subtracted from it\r\nwithout affecting in any way the value of the day coefficient of the date\r\nwhich the number will reach when counted from the starting point. This is\r\ntrue, because no matter what the day coefficient of the starting point may\r\nbe, any multiple of 13 will always bring the count back to the same day\r\ncoefficient. {139}\r\n\r\nTaking up the number, 31,741, which we have chosen for our first example,\r\nlet us deduct from it the highest multiple of 13 which it contains. This\r\nwill be found by dividing the number by 13, and multiplying the\r\n_whole-number part_ of the resulting quotient by 13: 31,741 ÷ 13 =\r\n2,441-8/13. Multiplying 2,441 by 13, we have 31,733, which is the highest\r\nmultiple of 13 that 31,741 contains; consequently it may be deducted from\r\n31,741 without affecting the value of the resulting day coefficient: 31,741\r\n- 31,733 = 8. In the example under consideration, therefore, 8 is the\r\nnumber which, if counted from the day coefficient of the starting point,\r\nwill give the day coefficient of the resulting date. In other words, after\r\ndividing by 13 the only part of the resulting quotient which is used in\r\ndetermining the new day coefficient is the _numerator_ of the fractional\r\npart.[100] Hence the following rule for determining the first unknown on\r\npage 138 (the day coefficient):\r\n\r\n_Rule 1._ To find the new day coefficient divide the given number by 13,\r\nand count forward the numerator of the fractional part of the resulting\r\nquotient from the starting point if the count is forward, and backward if\r\nthe count is backward, deducting 13 in either case from the resulting\r\nnumber if it should exceed 13.\r\n\r\nApplying this rule to 31,741, we have seen above that its division by 13\r\ngives as the fractional part of the quotient 8/13. Assuming that the count\r\nis forward from the starting point, 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu, if 8 (the numerator of\r\nthe fractional part of the quotient) be counted forward from 4, the day\r\ncoefficient of the starting point (4 Ahau 8 Cumhu), the day coefficient of\r\nthe resulting date will be 12 (4 + 8). Since this number is below 13, the\r\nlast sentence of the above rule has no application in this case. In\r\ncounting forward 31,741 from the date 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu, therefore, the day\r\ncoefficient of the resulting date will be 12; thus we have determined our\r\nfirst unknown. Let us next find the second unknown, the day sign to which\r\nthis 12 is prefixed.\r\n\r\nIt was explained on page 37 that the twenty day signs given in Table I\r\nsucceed one another in endless rotation, the first following immediately\r\nthe twentieth no matter which one of the twenty was chosen as the first.\r\nConsequently, it is clear that the highest multiple of 20 which the given\r\nnumber contains may be deducted from it without affecting in any way the\r\nname of the day sign of the date which the number will reach when counted\r\nfrom the starting point. This is true because, no matter what the day sign\r\nof the starting point may be, any multiple of 20 will always bring the\r\ncount back to the same day sign. {140}\r\n\r\nReturning to the number 31,741, let us deduct from it the highest multiple\r\nof 20 which it contains, found by dividing the number by 20 and multiplying\r\nthe whole number part of the resulting quotient by 20; 31,741 ÷ 20 =\r\n1,587-1/20. Multiplying 1,587 by 20, we have 31,740, which is the highest\r\nmultiple of 20 that 31,741 contains, and which may be deducted from 31,741\r\nwithout affecting the resulting day sign; 31,741 - 31,740 = 1. Therefore in\r\nthe present example 1 is the number which, if counted forward from the day\r\nsign of the starting point in the sequence of the 20 day signs given in\r\nTable I, will reach the day sign of the resulting date. In other words,\r\nafter dividing by 20 the only part of the resulting quotient which is used\r\nin determining the new day sign is the numerator of the fractional part.\r\nThus we may formulate the rule for determining the second unknown on page\r\n138 (the day sign):\r\n\r\n_Rule 2._ To find the new day sign, divide the given number by 20, and\r\ncount forward the numerator of the fractional part of the resulting\r\nquotient from the starting point in the sequence of the twenty day signs\r\ngiven in Table I, if the count is forward, and backward if the count is\r\nbackward, and the sign reached will be the new day sign.\r\n\r\nApplying this rule to 31,741, we have seen above that its division by 20\r\ngives us as the fractional part of the quotient, 1/20. Since the count was\r\nforward from the starting point, if 1 (the numerator of the fractional part\r\nof the quotient) be counted forward in the sequence of the 20 day signs in\r\nTable I from the day sign of the starting point, Ahau (4 Ahau 8 Cumhu), the\r\nday sign reached will be the day sign of the resulting date. Counting\r\nforward 1 from Ahau in Table I, the day sign Imix is reached, and Imix,\r\ntherefore, will be the new day sign. Thus our second unknown is determined.\r\n\r\nBy combining the above two values, the 12 for the first unknown and Imix\r\nfor the second, we can now say that in counting forward 31,741 from the\r\ndate 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu, the day reached will be 12 Imix. It remains to find\r\nwhat position this particular day occupied in the 365-day year, or haab,\r\nand thus to determine the third and fourth unknowns on page 138. Both of\r\nthese may be found at one time by the same operation.\r\n\r\nIt was explained on pages 44-51 that the Maya year, at least in so far as\r\nthe calendar was concerned, contained only 365 days, divided into 18 uinals\r\nof 20 days each, and the _xma kaba kin_ of 5 days; and further, that when\r\nthe last position in the last division of the year (4 Uayeb) was reached,\r\nit was followed without interruption by the first position of the first\r\ndivision of the next year (0 Pop); and, finally, that this sequence was\r\ncontinued indefinitely. Consequently it is clear that the highest multiple\r\nof 365 which the given number contains may be subtracted from it without\r\naffecting in any way the position in the year of the day which the number\r\nwill reach when {141} counted from the starting point. This is true,\r\nbecause no matter what position in the year the day of the starting point\r\nmay occupy, any multiple of 365 will bring the count back again to the same\r\nposition in the year.\r\n\r\nReturning again to the number 31,741, let us deduct from it the highest\r\nmultiple of 365 which it contains. This will be found by dividing the\r\nnumber by 365 and multiplying the whole number part of the resulting\r\nquotient by 365: 31,741 ÷ 365 = 86-351/365. Multiplying 86 by 365, we have\r\n31,390, which is the highest multiple that 31,741 contains. Hence it may be\r\ndeducted from 31,741 without affecting the position in the year of the\r\nresulting day; 31,741 - 31,390 = 351. Therefore, in the present example,\r\n351 is the number which, if counted forward from the year position of the\r\nstarting date in the sequence of the 365 positions in the year, given in\r\nTable XV, will reach the position in the year of the day of the resulting\r\ndate. This enables us to formulate the rule for determining the third and\r\nfourth unknowns on page 138 (the position in the year of the day of the\r\nresulting date):\r\n\r\n_Rule 3._ To find the position in the year of the new day, divide the given\r\nnumber by 365 and count forward the numerator of the fractional part of the\r\nresulting quotient from the year position of the starting point in the\r\nsequence of the 365 positions of the year shown in Table XV, if the count\r\nis forward; and backward if the count is backward, and the position reached\r\nwill be the position in the year which the day of the resulting date will\r\noccupy.\r\n\r\nTABLE XV.

Assuming that the count is forward from the starting point, it\r\nwill be necessary, therefore, to count 351 forward in Table XV from the\r\nposition 8 Cumhu, the position of the day of the starting point, 4 Ahau 8\r\nCumhu.\r\n\r\nA glance at the month of Cumhu in Table XV shows that after the position 8\r\nCumhu there are 11 positions in that month; adding to these the 5 in Uayeb,\r\nthe last division of the year, there will be in all 16 more positions\r\nbefore the first of the next year. Subtracting these from 351, the total\r\nnumber to be counted forward, there remains the number 335 (351-16), which\r\nmust be counted forward in Table XV from the beginning of the year. Since\r\neach of the months has 20 positions, it is clear that 16 months will be\r\nused before the month is reached in which will fall the 335th position from\r\nthe beginning of the year. In other words, 320 positions of our 335 will\r\nexactly use up all the positions of the first 16 months, namely, Pop, Uo,\r\nZip, Zotz, Tzec, Xul, Yaxkin, Mol, Chen, Yax, Zac, Ceh, Mac, Kankin, Muan,\r\nPax, and will bring us to the beginning of the 17th month (Kayab) with\r\nstill 15 more positions to count forward. If the student will refer to this\r\nmonth in Table XV he will see that 15 positions counted forward in this\r\nmonth will reach the position 14 Kayab, which is also the position reached\r\nby counting forward 31,741 positions from the starting position 8 Cumhu.\r\n\r\nHaving determined values for all of the unknowns on page 138, we can now\r\nsay that if the number 31,741 be counted forward from the date 4 Ahau 8\r\nCumhu, the date 12 Imix 14 Kayab will be reached. To this latter date,\r\ni. e., the date reached by any count, the name \"terminal date\" has been\r\ngiven. The rules indicating the processes by means of which this terminal\r\ndate is reached apply also to examples where the count is _backward_, not\r\nforward, from the starting point. In such cases, as the rules say, the only\r\ndifference is that the numerators of the fractional parts of the quotients\r\nresulting from the different divisions are to be counted backward from the\r\nstarting points, instead of forward as in the example above given.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to apply the rules by means of which our fourth step or\r\nprocess (see p. 138) may be carried out, a modification may sometimes be\r\nintroduced which will considerably decrease the size of the number to be\r\ncounted without affecting the values of the several parts of its resulting\r\nterminal date.\r\n\r\nWe have seen on pages 51-60 that in Maya chronology there were possible\r\nonly 18,980 different dates--that is, combinations of the 260 days and the\r\n365 positions of the year--and further, that any given day of the 260 could\r\nreturn to any given position of the 365 only after the lapse of 18,980\r\ndays, or 52 years. {143}\r\n\r\nSince the foregoing is true, it follows, that this number 18,980 or any\r\nmultiple thereof, may be deducted from the number which is to be counted\r\nwithout affecting in any way the terminal date which the number will reach\r\nwhen counted from the starting point. It is obvious that this modification\r\napplies only to numbers which are above 18,980, all others being divided by\r\n13, 20, and 365 directly, as indicated in rules 1, 2, and 3, respectively.\r\nThis enables us to formulate another rule, which should be applied to the\r\nnumber to be counted before proceeding with rules 1, 2, and 3 above, if\r\nthat number is above 18,980.\r\n\r\n_Rule_. If the number to be counted is above 18,980, first deduct from it\r\nthe highest multiple of 18,980 which it contains.\r\n\r\nThis rule should be applied whenever possible, since it reduces the size of\r\nthe number to be handled, and consequently involves fewer calculations.\r\n\r\nIn Table XVI are given 80 Calendar Rounds, that is, 80 multiples of 18,980,\r\nin terms of both the Maya notation and our own. These will be found\r\nsufficient to cover most numbers.\r\n\r\nApplying the above rule to the number 31,741, which was selected for our\r\nfirst example, it is seen by Table XVI that 1 Calendar Round, or 18,980\r\ndays, may be deducted from it; 31,741 - 18,980 = 12,761. In other words, we\r\ncan count the number 12,761 forward (or backward had the count been\r\nbackward in our example) from the starting point 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu, and reach\r\nexactly the same terminal date as though we had counted forward 31,741, as\r\nin the first case.\r\n\r\nMathematical proof of this point follows:\r\n\r\n    12,761 ÷ 13 = 981-8/13 12,761 ÷ 20 = 638-1/20 12,761 ÷ 365 = 34-351/365\r\n\r\nThe numerators of the fractions in these three quotients are 8, 1, and 351;\r\nthese are identical with the numerators of the fractions in the quotients\r\nobtained by dividing 31,741 by the same divisors, those indicated in rules\r\n1, 2, and 3, respectively. Consequently, if these three numerators be\r\ncounted forward from the corresponding parts of the starting point, 4 Ahau\r\n8 Cumhu, the resulting terms together will form the corresponding parts of\r\nthe same terminal date, 12 Imix 14 Kayab.\r\n\r\nSimilarly it could be shown that 50,721 or 69,701 counted forward or\r\nbackward from any starting point would both reach this same terminal date,\r\nsince subtracting 2 Calendar Rounds, 37,960 (see Table XVI), from the\r\nfirst, and 3 Calendar Rounds, 56,940 (see Table XVI), from the second,\r\nthere would remain in each case 12,761. The student will find his\r\ncalculations greatly facilitated if he will apply this rule whenever\r\npossible. To familiarize the student with the working of these rules, it is\r\nthought best to give several additional examples involving their use. {144}\r\n\r\nTABLE XVI. 80 CALENDAR ROUNDS EXPRESSED IN

than 18,980,\r\nor 1 Calendar Round, the preliminary rule given on page 143 does not apply\r\nin this case. Therefore we may proceed with the first rule given on page\r\n139, by means of which the new day coefficient may be determined. Dividing\r\nthe given number by 13 we have: 5,799 ÷ 13 = 446-1/13. Counting forward the\r\nnumerator of the fractional part of the resulting quotient (1) from the day\r\ncoefficient of the starting point (2), we reach 3 as the day coefficient of\r\nthe terminal date.\r\n\r\nThe second rule given on page 140 tells how to find the day sign of the\r\nterminal date. Dividing the given number by 20, we have: 5,799 ÷ 20 =\r\n289-19/20. Counting forward the numerator of the fractional part of the\r\nresulting quotient (19) from the day sign of the starting point, Kan, in\r\nthe sequence of the twenty-day signs given in Table I, the day sign Akbal\r\nwill be reached, which will be the day sign of the terminal date. Therefore\r\nthe day of the terminal date will be 3 Akbal.\r\n\r\nThe third rule, given on page 141, tells how to find the position which the\r\nday of the terminal date occupied in the 365-day year. Dividing the given\r\nnumber by 365, we have: 5,799 ÷ 365 = 15-324/365. Counting forward the\r\nnumerator of the fractional part of the resulting quotient, 324, from the\r\nyear position of the starting date, 7 Tzec, in the sequence of the 365 year\r\npositions given in Table XV, the position 6 Zip will be reached as the\r\nposition in the year of the day of the terminal date. The count by means of\r\nwhich the position 6 Zip is determined is given in detail. After the year\r\nposition of the starting point, 7 Tzec, it requires 12 more positions (Nos.\r\n8-19, inclusive) before the close of that month (see Table XV) will be\r\nreached. And after the close of Tzec, 13 uinals and the xma kaba kin must\r\npass before the end of the year; 13 × 20 + 5 = 265, and 265 + 12 = 277.\r\nThis latter number subtracted from 324, the total number of positions to be\r\ncounted forward, will give the number of positions which remain to be\r\ncounted in the next year following: 324 - 277 = 47. Counting forward 47 in\r\nthe new year, we find that it will use up the months Pop and Uo (20 + 20 =\r\n40) and extend 7 positions into the month Zip, or to 6 Zip. Therefore,\r\ngathering together the values determined for the several parts of the\r\nterminal date, we may say that in counting forward 5,799 from the starting\r\npoint 2 Kan 7 Tzec, the terminal date reached will be 3 Akbal 6 Zip.\r\n\r\nFor the next example let us select a much higher number, say 322,920, which\r\nwe will assume is to be counted forward from the starting point 13 Ik 0\r\nZip. Since this number is above 18,980, we may apply our preliminary rule\r\n(p. 143) and deduct all the Calendar {146} Rounds possible. By turning to\r\nTable XVI we see that 17 Calendar Rounds, or 322,660, may be deducted from\r\nour number: 322,920 - 322,660 = 260. In other words, we can use 260 exactly\r\nas though it were 322,920. Dividing by 13, we have 260 ÷ 13 = 20. Since\r\nthere is no fraction in the quotient, the numerator of the fraction will be\r\n0, and counting 0 forward from the day coefficient of the starting point,\r\n13, we have 13 as the day coefficient of the terminal date (rule 1, p.\r\n139). Dividing by 20 we have 260 ÷ 20 = 13. Since there is no fraction in\r\nthe quotient, the numerator of the fraction will be 0, and counting forward\r\n0 from the day sign of the starting point, Ik in Table I, the day sign Ik\r\nwill remain the day sign of the terminal date (rule 2, p. 140). Combining\r\nthe two values just determined, we see that the day of the terminal date\r\nwill be 13 Ik, or a day of the same name as the day of the starting point.\r\nThis follows also from the fact that there are only 260 differently named\r\ndays (see pp. 41-44) and any given day will have to recur, therefore, after\r\nthe lapse of 260 days.[101] Dividing by 365 we have: 260 ÷ 365 = 260/365.\r\nCounting forward the numerator of the fraction, 260, from the year position\r\nof the starting point, 0 Zip, in Table XV, the position in the year of the\r\nday of the terminal date will be found to be 0 Pax. Since 260 days equal\r\njust 13 uinals, we have only to count forward from 0 Zip 13 uinals in order\r\nto reach the year position; that is, 0 Zotz is 1 uinal; to 0 Tzec 2 uinals,\r\nto 0 Xul 3 uinals, and so on in Table XV to 0 Pax, which will complete the\r\nlast of the 13 uinals (rule 3, p. 141).\r\n\r\nCombining the above values, we find that in counting forward 322,920 (or\r\n260) from the starting point 13 Ik 0 Zip, the terminal date reached is 13\r\nIk 0 Pax.\r\n\r\nIn order to illustrate the method of procedure when the count is\r\n_backward_, let us assume an example of this kind. Suppose we count\r\nbackward the number 9,663 from the starting point 3 Imix 4 Uayeb. Since\r\nthis number is below 18,980, no Calendar Round can be deducted from it.\r\nDividing the given number by 13, we have: 9,663 ÷ 13 =743-4/13. Counting\r\nthe numerator of the fractional part of this quotient, 4, _backward_ from\r\nthe day coefficient of the starting point, 3, we reach 12 as the day\r\ncoefficient of the terminal date, that is, 2, 1, 13, 12 (rule 1, p. 139).\r\nDividing the given number by 20, we have: 9,663 ÷ 20 = 483-3/20. Counting\r\nthe numerator of the fractional part of this quotient, 3, _backward_ from\r\nthe day sign of the starting point, Imix, in Table I, we reach Eznab as the\r\nday sign of the terminal date (Ahau, Cauac, Eznab); consequently the day\r\nreached in the count will be 12 Eznab. Dividing the given number by 365, we\r\nhave {147} 9,663 ÷ 365 = 26-173/365. Counting _backward_ the numerator of\r\nthe fractional part of this quotient, 173, from the year position of the\r\nstarting point, 4 Uayeb, the year position of the terminal date will be\r\nfound to be 11 Yax. Before position 4 Uayeb (see Table XV) there are 4\r\npositions in that division of the year (3, 2, 1, 0). Counting these\r\n_backward_ to the end of the month Cumhu (see Table XV), we have left 169\r\npositions (173 - 4 = 169); this equals 8 uinals and 9 days extra.\r\nTherefore, beginning with the end of Cumhu, we may count _backward_ 8 whole\r\nuinals, namely: Cumhu, Kayab, Pax, Muan, Kankin, Mac, Ceh, and Zac, which\r\nwill bring us to the end of Yax (since we are counting backward). As we\r\nhave left still 9 days out of our original 173, these must be counted\r\nbackward from position 0 Zac, that is, beginning with position 19 Yax: 19,\r\n18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11; so 11 Yax is the position in the year of\r\nthe day of the terminal date. Assembling the above values, we find that in\r\ncounting the number 9,663 _backward_ from the starting point, 2 Imix 4\r\nUayeb, the terminal date is 12 Eznab 11 Yax. Whether the count be forward\r\nor backward, the method is the same, the only difference being in the\r\ndirection of the counting.\r\n\r\nThis concludes the discussion of the actual arithmetical processes involved\r\nin counting forward or backward any given number from any given date;\r\nhowever, before explaining the fifth and final step in deciphering the Maya\r\nnumbers, it is first necessary to show how this method of counting was\r\napplied to the Long Count.\r\n\r\nThe numbers used above in connection with dates merely express the\r\ndifference in time between starting points and terminal dates, without\r\nassigning either set of dates to their proper positions in Maya chronology;\r\nthat is, in the Long Count. Consequently, since any Maya date recurred at\r\nsuccessive intervals of 52 years, by the time their historic period had\r\nbeen reached, more than 3,000 years after the starting point of their\r\nchronology, the Maya had upward of 70 distinct dates of exactly the same\r\nname to distinguish from one another.\r\n\r\nIt was stated on page 61 that the 0, or starting point of Maya chronology,\r\nwas the date 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu, from which all subsequent dates were reckoned;\r\nand further, on page 63, that by recording the number of cycles, katuns,\r\ntuns, uinals, and kins which had elapsed in each case between this date and\r\nany subsequent dates in the Long Count, subsequent dates of the same name\r\ncould be readily distinguished from one another and assigned at the same\r\ntime to their proper positions in Maya chronology. This method of fixing a\r\ndate in the Long Count has been designated Initial-series dating.\r\n\r\nThe generally accepted method of writing Initial Series is as follows:\r\n\r\n  9.0.0.0.0.    8 Ahau 13 Ceh\r\n\r\nThe particular Initial-Series written here is to be interpreted thus:\r\n\"Counting forward 9 cycles, 0 katuns, 0 tuns, 0 uinals, and 0 kins {148}\r\nfrom 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu, the starting point of Maya chronology (always\r\nunexpressed in Initial Series), the terminal date reached will be 8 Ahau 13\r\nCeh.\"[102] Or again:\r\n\r\n  9.14.13.4.17.    12 Caban 5 Kayab\r\n\r\nThis Inital Series reads thus: \"Counting forward 9 cycles, 14 katuns, 13\r\ntuns, 4 uinals, and 17 kins from 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu, the starting point of Maya\r\nchronology (unexpressed), the terminal date reached will be 12 Caban 5\r\nKayab.\"\r\n\r\nThe time which separates any date from 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu may be called that\r\ndate's Initial-series value. For example, in the first of the above cases\r\nthe number 9.0.0.0.0 is the Initial-series value of the date 8 Ahau 13 Ceh,\r\nand in the second the number 9.14.13.4.17 is the Initial-series value of\r\nthe date 12 Caban 5 Kayab. It is clear from the foregoing that although the\r\ndate 8 Ahau 13 Ceh, for example, had recurred upward of 70 times since the\r\nbeginning of their chronology, the Maya were able to distinguish any\r\nparticular 8 Ahau 13 Ceh from all the others merely by recording its\r\ndistance from the starting point; in other words, giving thereto its\r\nparticular Initial-series value, as 9.0.0.0.0. in the present case.\r\nSimilarly, any particular 12 Caban 5 Kayab, by the addition of its\r\ncorresponding Initial-series value, as 9.14.13.4.17 in the case above\r\ncited, was absolutely fixed in the Long Count--that is, in a period of\r\n374,400 years.\r\n\r\nReturning now to the question of how the counting of numbers was applied to\r\nthe Long Count, it is evident that _every date in Maya chronology, starting\r\npoints as well as terminal dates, had its own particular Initial-series\r\nvalue_, though in many cases these values are not recorded. However, in\r\nmost of the cases in which the Initial-series values of dates are not\r\nrecorded, they may be calculated by means of their distances from other\r\ndates, whose Initial-series values are known. This adding and subtracting\r\nof numbers to and from Initial Series[103] constitutes the application of\r\nthe above-described arithmetical processes to the Long Count. Several\r\nexamples of this use are given below.\r\n\r\nLet us assume for the first case that the number 2.5.6.1 is to be counted\r\nforward from the Initial Series 9.0.0.0.0 8 Ahau 13 Ceh. By multiplying the\r\nvalues of the katuns, tuns, uinals, and kins given in Table XIII by their\r\ncorresponding coefficients, in this case 2, 5, 6, and 1, respectively, and\r\nadding the resulting products together, we find that 2.5.6.1 reduces to\r\n16,321 units of the first order.\r\n\r\nCounting this forward from 8 Ahau 13 Ceh as indicated by the rules on pages\r\n138-143, the terminal date 1 Imix 9 Yaxkin will be reached. {149} Moreover,\r\nsince the Initial-series value of the starting point 8 Ahau 13 Ceh was\r\n9.0.0.0.0, the Initial-series value of 1 Imix 9 Yaxkin, the terminal date,\r\nmay be calculated by adding its distance from 8 Ahau 13 Ceh to the\r\nInitial-series value of that date:\r\n\r\n  9.0.0.0.0 (Initial-series value of starting point) 8 Ahau 13 Ceh\r\n    2.5.6.1 (distance from 8 Ahau 13 Ceh to 1 Imix 9 Yaxkin)\r\n  9.2.5.6.1 (Initial-series value of terminal date) 1 Imix 9 Yaxkin\r\n\r\nThat is, by calculation we have determined the Initial-series value of the\r\nparticular 1 Imix 9 Yaxkin, which was distant 2.5.6.1 from 9.0.0.0.0 8 Ahau\r\n13 Ceh, to be 9.2.5.6.1, notwithstanding that this fact was not recorded.\r\n\r\nThe student may prove the accuracy of this calculation by treating\r\n9.2.5.6.1 1 Imix 9 Yaxkin as a new Initial Series and counting forward\r\n9.2.5.6.1 from 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu, the starting point of all Initial Series\r\nknown except two. If our calculations are correct, the former date will be\r\nreached just as if we had counted forward only 2.5.6.1 from 9.0.0.0.0 8\r\nAhau 13 Ceh.\r\n\r\nIn the above example the distance number 2.5.6.1 and the date 1 Imix 9\r\nYaxkin to which it reaches, together are called a Secondary Series. This\r\nmethod of dating already described (see pp. 74-76 et seq.) seems to have\r\nbeen used to avoid the repetition of the Initial-series values for all the\r\ndates in an inscription. For example, in the accompanying text--\r\n\r\n   9.12. 2. 0.16        5 Cib 14 Yaxkin\r\n        12. 9.15\r\n  [9.12.14.10.11][104]  9 Chuen 9 Kankin\r\n               5\r\n  [9.12.14.10.16]       1 Cib 14 Kankin\r\n      1. 0. 2. 5\r\n  [9.13.14.13. 1]       5 Imix 19 Zac\r\n\r\nthe only parts actually recorded are the Initial Series 9.12.2.0.16 {150} 5\r\nCib 14 Yaxkin, and the Secondary Series 12.9.15 leading to 9 Chuen 9\r\nKankin; the Secondary Series 5 leading to 1 Cib 14 Kankin; and the\r\nSecondary Series 1.0.2.5 leading to 5 Imix 19 Zac. The Initial-series\r\nvalues: 9.12.14.10.11; 9.12.14.10.16; and 9.13.14.13.1, belonging to the\r\nthree dates of the Secondary Series, respectively, do not appear in the\r\ntext at all (a fact indicated by the brackets), but are found only by\r\ncalculation. Moreover, the student should note that in a succession of\r\ninterdependent series like the ones just given the terminal date reached by\r\none number, as 9 Chuen 9 Kankin, becomes the starting point for the next\r\nnumber, 5. Again, the terminal date reached by counting 5 from 9 Chuen 9\r\nKankin, that is, 1 Cib 14 Kankin, becomes the starting point from which the\r\nnext number, 1.0.2.5, is counted. In other words, these terms are only\r\nrelative, since the terminal date of one number will be the starting point\r\nof the next.\r\n\r\nLet us assume for the next example, that the number 3.2 is to be counted\r\nforward from the Initial Series 9.12.3.14.0 5 Ahau 8 Uo. Reducing 3 uinals\r\nand 2 kins to kins, we have 62 units of the first order. Counting forward\r\n62 from 5 Ahau 8 Uo, as indicated by the rules on pages 138-143, it is\r\nfound that the terminal date will be 2 Ik 10 Tzec. Since the Initial-series\r\nvalue of the starting point 5 Ahau 8 Uo is known, namely, 9.12.3.14.0, the\r\nInitial Series corresponding to the terminal date may be calculated from it\r\nas before:\r\n\r\n   9.12.3.14.0  (Initial-series value of the starting point) 5 Ahau 8 Uo\r\n           3.2  (distance from 5 Ahau 8 Uo forward to 2 Ik 10 Tzec)\r\n  [9.12.3.17.2] (Initial-series value of the terminal date) 2 Ik 10 Tzec\r\n\r\nThe bracketed 9.12.3.17.2 in the Initial-series value corresponding to the\r\ndate 2 Ik 10 Tzec does not appear in the record but was reached by\r\ncalculation. The student may prove the accuracy of this result by treating\r\n9.12.3.17.2 2 Ik 10 Tzec as a new Initial Series, and counting forward\r\n9.12.3.17.2 from 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu (the starting point of Maya chronology,\r\nunexpressed in Initial Series). If our calculations are correct, the same\r\ndate, 2 Ik 10 Tzec, will be reached, as though we had counted only 3.2\r\nforward from the Initial Series 9.12.3.14.0 5 Ahau 8 Uo.\r\n\r\nOne more example presenting a \"backward count\" will suffice to illustrate\r\nthis method. Let us count the number 14.13.4.17 _backward_ from the Initial\r\nSeries 9.14.13.4.17 12 Caban 5 Kayab. Reducing 14.13.4.17 to units of the\r\n1st order, we have 105,577. Counting this number _backward_ from 12 Caban 5\r\nKayab, as indicated in the rules on pages 138-143, we find that the\r\nterminal date will be 8 Ahau 13 Ceh. Moreover, since the Initial-series\r\nvalue of the starting point 12 Caban 5 Kayab is known, namely,\r\n9.14.13.4.17, the Initial-series value of {151} the terminal date may be\r\ncalculated by _subtracting_ the distance number 14.13.4.17 from the Initial\r\nSeries of the starting point:\r\n\r\n   9.14.13.4.17  (Initial-series value of the starting point)\r\n                                                          12 Caban 5 Kayab\r\n     14.13.4.17  (distance from 12 Caban 5 Kayab backward to 8 Ahau 13 Ceh)\r\n  [9. 0. 0.0. 0] (Initial-series value of the terminal date) 8 Ahau 13 Ceh\r\n\r\nThe bracketed parts are not expressed. We have seen elsewhere that the\r\nInitial Series 9.0.0.0.0 has for its terminal date 8 Ahau 13 Ceh; therefore\r\nour calculation proves itself.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing examples make it sufficiently clear that the distance numbers\r\nof Secondary Series may be used to determine the Initial-series values of\r\nSecondary-series dates, either by their addition to or subtraction from\r\nknown Initial-series dates.\r\n\r\nWe have come now to the final step in the consideration of Maya numbers,\r\nnamely, the identification of the terminal dates determined by the\r\ncalculations given under the fourth step, pages 138-143. This step may be\r\nsummed up as follows:\r\n\r\nFIFTH STEP IN SOLVING MAYA NUMBERS\r\n\r\nFind the terminal date to which the number leads.\r\n\r\nAs explained under the fourth step (pp. 138-143), the terminal date may be\r\nfound by calculation. The above direction, however, refers to the actual\r\nfinding of the terminal dates in the texts; that is, where to look for\r\nthem. It may be said at the outset in this connection that terminal dates\r\nin the great majority of cases follow immediately the numbers which lead to\r\nthem. Indeed, the connection between distance numbers and their\r\ncorresponding terminal dates is far closer than between distance numbers\r\nand their corresponding starting points. This probably results from the\r\nfact that the closing dates of Maya periods were of far more importance\r\nthan their opening dates. Time was measured by elapsed periods and recorded\r\nin terms of the ending days of such periods. The great emphasis on the\r\nclosing date of a period in comparison with its opening date probably\r\ncaused the suppression and omission of the date 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu, the\r\nstarting point of Maya chronology, in all Initial Series. To the same cause\r\nalso may probably be attributed the great uniformity in the positions of\r\nalmost all terminal dates, i.e., immediately after the numbers leading to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWe may formulate, therefore, the following general rule, which the student\r\nwill do well to apply in every case, since exceptions to it are very rare:\r\n\r\n_Rule._ The terminal date reached by a number or series almost invariably\r\nfollows immediately the last term of the number or series leading to it.\r\n{152}\r\n\r\nThis applies equally to all terminal dates, whether in Initial Series,\r\nSecondary Series, Calendar-round dating or Period-ending dating, though in\r\nthe case of Initial Series a peculiar division or partition of the terminal\r\ndate is to be noted.\r\n\r\nThroughout the inscriptions, excepting in the case of Initial Series, the\r\nmonth parts of the dates almost invariably follow immediately the days\r\nwhose positions in the year they designate, without any other glyphs\r\nstanding between; as, for example, 8 Ahau 13 Ceh, 12 Caban 5 Kayab, etc. In\r\nInitial Series, on the other hand, the day parts of the dates, as 8 Ahau\r\nand 12 Caban, in the above examples, are almost invariably separated from\r\ntheir corresponding month parts, 13 Ceh or 5 Kayab, by several intervening\r\nglyphs. The positions of the day parts in Initial-series terminal dates are\r\nquite regular according to the terms of the above rule; that is, they\r\nfollow immediately the lowest period of the number which in each case shows\r\ntheir distance from the unexpressed starting point, 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu. The\r\npositions of the corresponding month parts are, on the other hand,\r\nirregular. These, instead of standing immediately after the days whose\r\npositions in the year they designate, follow at the close of some six or\r\nseven intervening glyphs. These intervening glyphs have been called the\r\nSupplementary Series, though the count which they record has not as yet\r\nbeen deciphered.[105] The month glyph in the great majority of cases\r\nfollows immediately the closing[106] glyph of the Supplementary Series. The\r\nform of this latter sign is always unmistakable (see fig. 65), and it is\r\nfurther characterized by its numerical coefficient, which can never be\r\nanything but 9 or 10.[107] See examples of this sign in the figure just\r\nmentioned, where both normal forms _a, c, e, g,_ and _h_ and head variants\r\n_b, d,_ and _f_ are included.\r\n\r\nThe student will find this glyph exceedingly helpful in locating the month\r\nparts of Initial-series terminal dates in the inscriptions. For example,\r\nlet us suppose in deciphering the Initial Series 9.16.5.0.0 8 Ahau 8 Zotz\r\nthat the number 9.16.5.0.0 has been counted forward {153} from 4 Ahau 8\r\nCumhu (the unexpressed starting point), and has been found by calculation\r\nto reach the terminal date 8 Ahau 8 Zotz; and further, let us suppose that\r\non inspecting the text the day part of this date (8 Ahau) has been found to\r\nbe recorded immediately after the 0 kins of the number 9.16.5.0.0. Now, if\r\nthe student will follow the next six or seven glyphs until he finds one\r\nlike any of the forms in figure 65, the glyph immediately following the\r\nlatter sign will be in all probability the month part, 8 Zotz in the above\r\nexample, of an Initial-series' terminal date. In other words, although the\r\nmeaning of the glyph shown in the last-mentioned figure is unknown, it is\r\nimportant for the student to recognize its form, since it is almost\r\ninvariably the \"indicator\" of the month sign in Initial Series.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 65. Sign for the \"month indicator\": _a, c, e, g, h_,\r\nNormal forms; _b, d, f_, head variants.]\r\n\r\nIn all other cases in the inscriptions, including also the exceptions to\r\nthe above rule, that is, where the month parts of Initial-series terminal\r\ndates do not immediately follow the closing glyph of the Supplementary\r\nSeries, the month signs follow immediately the day signs whose positions in\r\nthe year they severally designate.\r\n\r\nIn the codices the month signs when recorded[108] usually follow\r\nimmediately the days signs to which they belong. The most notable\r\nexception[109] to this general rule occurs in connection with the\r\nVenus-solar periods represented on pages 46-50 of the Dresden Codex, where\r\none set of day signs is used with three different sets of month signs to\r\nform three different sets of dates. For example, in one place the day 2\r\nAhau stands above three different month signs--3 Cumhu, 3 Zotz, and 13\r\nYax--with each of which it is used to form a {154} different date--2 Ahau 3\r\nCumhu, 2 Ahau 3 Zotz, and 2 Ahau 13 Yax. In these pages the month signs,\r\nwith a few exceptions, do not follow immediately the days to which they\r\nbelong, but on the contrary they are separated from them by several\r\nintervening glyphs. This abbreviation in the record of these dates was\r\ndoubtless prompted by the desire or necessity for economizing space. In the\r\nabove example, instead of repeating the 2 Ahau with each of the two lower\r\nmonth signs, 3 Zotz and 13 Yax, by writing it once above the upper month\r\nsign, 3 Cumhu, the scribe intended that it should be used in turn with each\r\none of the three month signs standing below it, to form three different\r\ndates, saving by this abbreviation the space of two glyphs, that is, double\r\nthe space occupied by 2 Ahau.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the Initial-series dates in the inscriptions and the\r\nVenus-Solar dates on pages 46-50 of the Dresden Codex, we may say that the\r\nregular position of the month glyphs in Maya writing was immediately\r\nfollowing the day glyphs whose positions in the year they severally\r\ndesignated.\r\n\r\nIn closing the presentation of this last step in the process of deciphering\r\nnumbers in the texts, the great value of the terminal date as a final check\r\nfor all the calculations involved under steps 1-4 (pp. 134-151) should be\r\npointed out. If after having worked out the terminal date of a given number\r\naccording to these rules the terminal date thus found should differ from\r\nthat actually recorded under step 5, we must accept one of the following\r\nalternatives:\r\n\r\n  1. There is an error in our own calculations; or\r\n\r\n  2. There is an error in the original text; or\r\n\r\n  3. The case in point lies without the operation of our rules.\r\n\r\nIt is always safe for the beginner to proceed on the assumption that the\r\nfirst of the above alternatives is the cause of the error; in other words,\r\nthat his own calculations are at fault. If the terminal date as calculated\r\ndoes not agree with the terminal-date as recorded, the student should\r\nrepeat his calculations several times, checking up each operation in order\r\nto eliminate the possibility of a purely arithmetical error, as a mistake\r\nin multiplication. After all attempts to reach the recorded terminal date\r\nby counting the given number from the starting point have failed, the\r\nprocess should be reversed and the attempt made to reach the starting point\r\nby counting backward the given number from its recorded terminal date.\r\nSometimes this reverse process will work out correctly, showing that there\r\nmust be some arithmetical error in our original calculations which we have\r\nfailed to detect. However, when both processes have failed several times to\r\nconnect the starting point with the recorded terminal date by use of the\r\ngiven number, there remains the possibility that either the starting point\r\nor the terminal date, or perhaps both, do not belong to the given number.\r\nThe rules for determining this fact {155} have been given under step 2,\r\npage 135, and step 4, page 138. If after applying these to the case in\r\npoint it seems certain that the starting point and terminal date used in\r\nthe calculations both belong to the given number, we have to fall back on\r\nthe second of the above alternatives, that is, that there is an error in\r\nthe original text.\r\n\r\nAlthough very unusual, particularly in the inscriptions, errors in the\r\noriginal texts are by no means entirely unknown. These seem to be\r\nrestricted chiefly to errors in numerals, as the record of 7 for 8, or 7\r\nfor 12 or 17, that is, the omission or insertion of one or more bars or\r\ndots. In a very few instances there seem to be errors in the month glyph.\r\nSuch errors usually are obvious, as will be pointed out in connection with\r\nthe texts in which they are found (see Chapters V and VI).\r\n\r\nIf both of the above alternatives are found not to apply, that is, if both\r\nour calculations and the original texts are free from error, we are obliged\r\nto accept the third alternative as the source of trouble, namely, that the\r\ncase in point lies without the operation of our rules. In such cases it is\r\nobviously impossible to go further in the present state of our knowledge.\r\nSpecial conditions presented by glyphs whose meanings are unknown may\r\ngovern such cases. At all events, the failure of the rules under 1-4 to\r\nreach the terminal dates recorded as under 5 introduces a new phase of\r\nglyph study--the meaning of unknown forms with which the beginner has no\r\nconcern. Consequently, when a text falls without the operation of the rules\r\ngiven in this chapter--a very rare contingency--the beginner should turn\r\nhis attention elsewhere. {156}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE INSCRIPTIONS\r\n\r\nThe present chapter will be devoted to the interpretation of texts drawn\r\nfrom monuments, a process which consists briefly in the application to the\r\ninscriptions[110] of the material presented in Chapters III and IV.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 66. Diagram showing the method of designating\r\nparticular glyphs in a text.]\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding with this discussion it will first be necessary to\r\nexplain the method followed in designating particular glyphs in a text. We\r\nhave seen (p. 23) that the Maya glyphs were presented in parallel columns,\r\nwhich are to be read two columns at a time, the order of the individual\r\nglyph-blocks[111] in each pair of columns being from left to right and from\r\ntop to bottom. For convenience in referring to particular glyphs in the\r\ntexts, the vertical columns of glyph-blocks are lettered from left to\r\nright, thus, A, B, C, D, etc., and the horizontal rows numbered from top to\r\nbottom, thus, 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. For example, in figure 66 the glyph-blocks\r\nin columns A and B are read together from left to right and top to bottom,\r\nthus, A1 B1, A2 B2, A3 B3, etc. When glyph-block B10 is reached the next in\r\norder is C1, which is followed by D1, C2 D2, C3 D3, etc. Again, when D10 is\r\nreached the next in order is E1, which is followed by F1, E2 F2, E3 F3,\r\netc. In this way the order of reading proceeds from left to right and from\r\ntop to bottom, in pairs of columns, that is, G H, I J, K L, and M N\r\nthroughout the inscription, and usually closes with the glyph-block in the\r\nlower right-hand corner, as N10 in figure 66. By this simple system of\r\ncoordinates any particular glyph in a text may be readily referred to when\r\nthe need arises. Thus, for example, in figure 66 glyph [alpha] is referred\r\nto as D3; glyph [beta] as F6; glyph [gamma] as K4; glyph [delta] as N10. In\r\na few texts the glyph-blocks are so irregularly placed that it is\r\nimpracticable to designate them by the above coordinates. In such cases the\r\norder of the glyph-blocks will be indicated by numerals, 1, 2, 3, etc. In\r\ntwo Copan texts, Altar S (fig. 81) and Stela J (pl. 15), made from the\r\ndrawings of Mr. Maudslay, his numeration of the glyphs has been followed.\r\nThis numeration appears in these two figures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GLYPHS REPRESENTING INITIAL SERIES, SHOWING USE OF BAR\r\nAND DOT NUMERALS AND NORMAL-FORM PERIOD GLYPHS]\r\n\r\n{157}\r\n\r\nTEXTS RECORDING INITIAL SERIES\r\n\r\nBecause of the fundamental importance of Initial Series in the Maya system\r\nof chronology, the first class of texts represented will illustrate this\r\nmethod of dating. Moreover, since the normal forms for the numerals and the\r\nperiod glyphs will be more easily recognised by the beginner than the\r\ncorresponding head variants, the first Initial Series given will be found\r\nto have all the numerals and period glyphs expressed by normal forms.[112]\r\n\r\nIn plate 6 is figured the drawing of the Initial Series[113] from Zoömorph\r\nP at Quirigua, a monument which is said to be the finest piece of\r\naboriginal sculpture in the western hemisphere. Our text opens with one\r\nlarge glyph, which occupies the space of four glyph-blocks, A1-B2.[114]\r\nAnalysis of this form shows that it possesses all the elements mentioned on\r\npage 65 as belonging to the so-called Initial-series introducing glyph,\r\nwithout which Initial Series never seem to have been recorded in the\r\ninscriptions. These elements are: (1) the trinal {158} superfix, (2) the\r\npair of comblike lateral appendages, (3) the normal form of the tun sign,\r\n(4) the trinal subfix, and (5) the variable central element. As stated\r\nabove, all these appear in the large glyph A1-B2. Moreover, a comparison of\r\nA1-B2 with the introducing glyphs given in figure 24 shows that these forms\r\nare variants of one and the same sign. Consequently, in A1-B2 we have\r\nrecorded an Initial-series introducing glyph. The use of this sign is so\r\nhighly specialized that, on the basis of its occurrence alone in a text,\r\nthe student is perfectly justified in assuming that an Initial Series will\r\nimmediately follow.[115] Exceptions to this rule are so very rare (see p.\r\n67) that the beginner will do well to disregard them altogether.\r\n\r\nThe next glyph after the introducing glyph in an Initial Series is the\r\ncycle sign, the highest period ever found in this kind of count[116]. The\r\ncycle sign in the present example appears in A3 with the coefficient 9 (1\r\nbar and 4 dots). Although the period glyph is partially effaced in the\r\noriginal enough remains to trace its resemblance to the normal form of the\r\ncycle sign shown in figure 25, _a-c_. The outline of the repeated Cauac\r\nsign appears in both places. We have then, in this glyph, the record of 9\r\ncycles[117]. The glyph following the cycle sign in an Initial Series is\r\nalways the katun sign, and this should appear in B3, the glyph next in\r\norder. This glyph is quite clearly the normal form of the katun sign, as a\r\ncomparison of it with figure 27, _a, b_, the normal form for the katun,\r\nwill show. It has the normal-form numeral 18 (3 bars and 3 dots) prefixed\r\nto it, and this whole glyph therefore signifies 18 katuns. The next glyph\r\nshould record the tuns, and a comparison of the glyph in A4 with the normal\r\nform of the tun sign in figure 29, _a, b_, shows this to be the case. The\r\nnumeral 5 (1 bar prefixed to the tun sign) shows that this period is to be\r\nused 5 times; that is, multiplied by 5. The next glyph (B4) should be the\r\nuinal sign, and a comparison of B4 with figure 31, _a-c_, the normal form\r\nof the uinal sign, shows the identity of these two glyphs. The coefficient\r\nof the uinal sign contains as its most conspicuous element the clasped\r\nhand, which suggests that we may have 0 uinals recorded in B4. A comparison\r\nof this coefficient with the sign for zero in figure 54 proves this to be\r\nthe case. The next glyph (A5) should be the kin sign, the lowest period\r\ninvolved in recording Initial Series. A comparison of A5 with the normal\r\nform of the kin sign in figure 34, _a_, shows that these two forms are\r\nidentical. The coefficient of A5 is, moreover, exactly like the coefficient\r\nof B4, which, we have seen, meant zero, hence glyph A5 stands for 0 kins.\r\nSummarizing the above, we may say that glyphs A3-A5 record an\r\nInitial-series number consisting of 6 cycles, 18 katuns, 5 tuns, 0 uinals,\r\nand 0 kins, which we may write thus: 9.18.5.0.0 (see p. 138, footnote 1).\r\n{159}\r\n\r\nNow let us turn to Chapter IV and apply the several steps there given, by\r\nmeans of which Maya numbers may be solved. The first step on page 134 was\r\nto reduce the given number, in this case 9.18.5.0.0, to units of the first\r\norder; this may be done by multiplying the recorded coefficients by the\r\nnumerical values of the periods to which they are respectively attached.\r\nThese values are given in Table XIII, and the sum of the products arising\r\nfrom their multiplication by the coefficients recorded in the Initial\r\nSeries in plate 6, A are given below:\r\n\r\n  A3 =  9 × 144,000 = 1,296,000\r\n  B3 = 18 ×   7,200 =   129,600\r\n  A4 =  5 ×     360 =     1,800\r\n  B4 =  0 ×      20 =         0\r\n  A5 =  0 ×       1 =         0\r\n                     ----------\r\n                      1,427,400\r\n\r\nTherefore 1,427,400 will be the number used in the following calculations.\r\n\r\nThe second step (see step 2, p. 135) is to determine the starting point\r\nfrom which this number is counted. According to rule 2, page 136, if the\r\nnumber is an Initial Series the starting point, although never recorded, is\r\npractically always the date 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu. Exceptions to this rule are so\r\nvery rare that they may be disregarded by the beginner, and it may be taken\r\nfor granted, therefore, in the present case, that our number 1,427,400 is\r\nto be counted from the date 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu.\r\n\r\nThe third step (see step 3, p. £136) is to determine the direction of the\r\ncount, whether forward or backward. In this connection it was stated that\r\nthe general practice is to count forward, and that the student should\r\nalways proceed upon this assumption. However, in the present case there is\r\nno room for uncertainty, since the direction of the count in an Initial\r\nSeries is governed by an invariable rule. In Initial Series, according to\r\nthe rule on page 137, the count is always forward, consequently 1,427,400\r\nis to be counted _forward_ from 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu.\r\n\r\nThe fourth step (see step 4, p. 138) is to count the given number from its\r\nstarting point; and the rules governing this process will be found on pages\r\n139-143. Since our given number (1,427,400) is greater than 18,980, or 1\r\nCalendar Round, the preliminary rule on page 143 applies in the present\r\ncase, and we may therefore subtract from 1,427,400 all the Calendar Rounds\r\npossible before proceeding to count it from the starting point. By\r\nreferring to Table XVI, it appears that 1,427,400 contains 75 complete\r\nCalendar Rounds, or 1,423,500; hence, the latter number may be subtracted\r\n{160} from 1,427,400 without affecting the value of the resulting terminal\r\ndate: 1,427,400 - 1,423,500 = 3,900. In other words, in counting forward\r\n3,900 from 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu, the same terminal date will be reached as though\r\nwe had counted forward 1,427,400.[118]\r\n\r\nIn order to find the coefficient of the day of the terminal date, it is\r\nnecessary, by rule 1, page 139, to divide the given number or its\r\nequivalent by 13; 3,900 ÷ 13 = 300. Now since there is no fractional part\r\nin the resulting quotient, the numerator of an assumed fractional part will\r\nbe 0; counting forward 0 from the coefficient of the day of the starting\r\npoint, 4 (that is, 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu), we reach 4 as the coefficient of the\r\nday of the terminal date.\r\n\r\nIn order to find the day sign of the terminal date, it is necessary, under\r\nrule 2, page 140, to divide the given number or its equivalent by 20; 3,900\r\n÷ 20 = 195. Since there is no fractional part in the resulting quotient,\r\nthe numerator of an assumed fractional part will be 0; counting forward 0\r\nin Table I, from Ahau, the day sign of the starting point (4 Ahau 8 Cumhu),\r\nwe reach Ahau as the day sign of the terminal date. In other words, in\r\ncounting forward either 3,900 or 1,427,400 from 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu, the day\r\nreached will be 4 Ahau. It remains to show what position in the year this\r\nday 4 Ahau distant 1,427,400 from the date 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu, occupied.\r\n\r\nIn order to find the position in the year which the day of the terminal\r\ndate occupied, it is necessary, under rule 3, page 141, to divide the given\r\nnumber or its equivalent by 365; 3,900 ÷ 365 = 10-250/365. Since the\r\nnumerator of the fractional part of the resulting quotient is 250, to reach\r\nthe year position of the day of the terminal date desired it is necessary\r\nto count 250 forward from 8 Cumhu, the year position of the day of the\r\nstarting point 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu. It appears from Table XV, in which the 365\r\npositions of the year are given, that after position 8 Cumhu there are only\r\n16 positions in the year--11 more in Cumhu and 5 in Uayeb. These must be\r\nsubtracted, therefore, from 250 in order to bring the count to the end of\r\nthe year; 250 - 16 = 234, so 234 is the number of positions we must count\r\nforward in the new year. It is clear that the first 11 uinals in the year\r\nwill use up exactly 220 of our 234 positions (11 × 20 = 220), and that 14\r\npositions will be left, which must be counted in the next uinal, the 12th.\r\nBut the 12th uinal of the year is Ceh (see Table XV); counting forward 14\r\npositions in Ceh, we reach 13 Ceh, which is, therefore, the month glyph of\r\nour terminal date. In other words, counting 250 forward from 8 Cumhu,\r\nposition 13 Ceh is reached. Assembling the above values, we find that by\r\ncalculation we have determined the terminal date of the Initial Series in\r\nplate 6, _A_, to be 4 Ahau 13 Ceh. {161}\r\n\r\nAt this point there are several checks which the student may apply to his\r\nresult in order to test the accuracy of his calculations; for instance, in\r\nthe present example if 115, the difference between 365 and 250 (115 + 250 =\r\n365) is counted forward from position 13 Ceh, position 8 Cumhu will be\r\nreached if our calculations were correct. This is true because there are\r\nonly 365 positions in the year, and having reached 13 Ceh in counting\r\nforward 250 from 8 Cumhu, counting the remaining 115 days forward from day\r\nreached by 250, that is, 13 Ceh, we should reach our starting point (8\r\nCumhu) again. Another good check in the present case would be to count\r\n_backward_ 250 from 13 Ceh; if our calculations have been correct, the\r\nstarting point 8 Cumhu will be reached. Still another check, which may be\r\napplied is the following: From Table VII it is clear that the day sign Ahau\r\ncan occupy only positions 3, 8, 13, or 18 in the divisions of the\r\nyear;[119] hence, if in the above case the coefficient of Ceh had been any\r\nother number but one of these four, our calculations would have been\r\nincorrect.\r\n\r\nWe come now to the final step (see step 5, p. 151), the actual finding of\r\nthe glyphs in our text which represent the two parts of the terminal\r\ndate--the day and its corresponding position in the year. If we have made\r\nno arithmetical errors in calculations and if the text itself presents no\r\nirregular and unusual features, the terminal date recorded should agree\r\nwith the terminal date obtained by calculation.\r\n\r\nIt was explained on page 152 that the two parts of an Initial-series\r\nterminal date are usually separated from each other by several intervening\r\nglyphs, and further that, although the day part follows immediately the\r\nlast period glyph of the number (the kin glyph), the month part is not\r\nrecorded until after the close of the Supplementary Series, usually a\r\nmatter of six or seven glyphs. Returning to our text (pl. 6, _A_), we find\r\nthat the kins are recorded in A5, therefore the day part of the terminal\r\ndate should appear in B5. The glyph in B5 quite clearly records the day 4\r\nAhau by means of 4 dots prefixed to the sign shown in figure 16, _e'-g'_,\r\nwhich is the form for the day name Ahau, thereby agreeing with the value of\r\nthe day part of the terminal date as determined by calculation. So far then\r\nwe have read our text correctly. Following along the next six or seven\r\nglyphs, A6-C1a, which record the Supplementary Series,[120] we reach in C1a\r\na sign similar to the forms shown in figure 65. This glyph, which always\r\nhas a coefficient of 9 or 10, was designated on page 152 the month-sign\r\n\"indicator,\" since it usually immediately precedes the month sign in\r\nInitial-series terminal dates. In C1a it has the coefficient 9 (4 dots and\r\n1 bar) and is followed in C1b by the month part {162} of the terminal date,\r\n13 Ceh. The bar and dot numeral 13 appears very clearly above the month\r\nsign, which, though partially effaced, yet bears sufficient resemblance to\r\nthe sign for Ceh in figure 19, _u, v,_ to enable us to identify it as such.\r\n\r\nOur complete Initial Series, therefore, reads: 9.18.5.0.0 4 Ahau 13 Ceh,\r\nand since the terminal date recorded in B5, C1b agrees with the terminal\r\ndate determined by calculation, we may conclude that this text is without\r\nerror and, furthermore, that it records a date, 4 Ahau 13 Ceh, which was\r\ndistant 9.18.5.0.0 from the starting point of Maya chronology. The writer\r\ninterprets this text as signifying that 9.18.5.0.0 4 Ahau 13 Ceh was the\r\ndate on which Zoömorph P at Quirigua was formally consecrated or dedicated\r\nas a time-marker, or in other words, that Zoömorph P was the monument set\r\nup to mark the hotun, or 5-tun period, which came to a close on the date\r\n9.18.5.0.0 4 Ahau 13 Ceh of Maya chronology.[121]\r\n\r\nIn plate 6, _B_, is figured a drawing of the Initial Series on Stela 22 at\r\nNaranjo.[122] The text opens in A1 with the Initial-series introducing\r\nglyph, which is followed in B1 B3 by the Initial-series number\r\n9.12.15.13.7. The five period glyphs are all expressed by their\r\ncorresponding normal forms, and the student will have no difficulty in\r\nidentifying them and reading the number, as above recorded.\r\n\r\nBy means of Table XIII this number may be reduced to units of the 1st\r\norder, in which form it may be more conveniently used. This reduction,\r\nwhich forms the first step in the process of solving Maya numbers (see step\r\n1, p. 134), follows:\r\n\r\n  B1 =  9 × 144,000 = 1,296,000\r\n  A2 = 12 ×   7,200 =    86,400\r\n  B2 = 15 ×     360 =     5,400\r\n  A3 = 13 ×      20 =       260\r\n  B3 =  7 ×       1 =         7\r\n                      ---------\r\n                      1,388,067\r\n\r\nAnd 1,388,067 will be the number used in the following calculations.\r\n\r\nThe next step is to find the starting point from which 1,388,067 is counted\r\n(see step 2, p. 135). Since this number is an Initial Series, in all\r\nprobability its starting point will be the date 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu; at least it\r\nis perfectly safe to proceed on that assumption.\r\n\r\nThe next step is to find the direction of the count (see step 3, p. 136);\r\nsince our number is an Initial Series, the count can only be forward (see\r\nrule 2, p. 137).[123] {163}\r\n\r\nHaving determined the number to be counted, the starting point from which\r\nthe count commences, and the direction of the count, we may now proceed\r\nwith the actual process of counting (see step 4, p. 138).\r\n\r\nSince 1,388,067 is greater than 18,980 (1 Calendar Round), we may deduct\r\nfrom the former number all the Calendar Rounds possible (see preliminary\r\nrule, page 143). According to Table XVI it appears that 1,388,067 contains\r\n73 Calendar Rounds, or 1,385,540; after deducting this from the given\r\nnumber we have left 2,527 (1,388,067 - 1,385,540), a far more convenient\r\nnumber to handle than 1,388,067.\r\n\r\nApplying rule 1 (p. 139) to 2,527, we have: 2,527 ÷ 13 = 194-5/13, and\r\ncounting forward 5, the numerator of the fractional part of the quotient,\r\nfrom 4, the day coefficient of the starting point, 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu, we reach\r\n9 as the day coefficient of the terminal date.\r\n\r\nApplying rule 2 (p. 140) to 2,527, we have: 2,527 ÷ 20 = 126-7/20; and\r\ncounting forward 7, the numerator of the fractional part of the quotient,\r\nfrom Ahau, the day sign of our starting point, 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu, in Table I,\r\nwe reach Manik as the day sign of the terminal date. Therefore, the day of\r\nthe terminal date will be 9 Manik.\r\n\r\nApplying rule 3 (p. 141) to 2,527, we have: 2,527 ÷ 365 = 6-337/365; and\r\ncounting forward 337, the numerator of the fractional part of the quotient,\r\nfrom 8 Cumhu, the year position of the starting point, 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu, in\r\nTable XV, we reach 0 Kayab as the year position of the terminal date. The\r\ncalculations by means of which 0 Kayab is reached are as follows: After 8\r\nCumhu there are 16 positions in the year, which we must subtract from 337;\r\n337 - 16 = 321, which is to be counted forward in the new year. This number\r\ncontains just 1 more than 16 uinals, that is, 321 = (16 × 20) + 1; hence it\r\nwill reach through the first 16 uinals in Table XV and to the first\r\nposition in the 17th uinal, 0 Kayab. Combining this with the day obtained\r\nabove, we have for our terminal date determined by calculation, 9 Manik 0\r\nKayab.\r\n\r\nThe next and last step (see step 5, p. 151) is to find the above date in\r\nthe text. In Initial Series (see p. 152) the two parts of the terminal date\r\nare generally separated, the day part usually following immediately the\r\nlast period glyph and the month part the closing glyph of the Supplementary\r\nSeries. In plate 6, _B_, the last period glyph, as we have seen, is\r\nrecorded in B3; therefore the day should appear in A4. Comparing the glyph\r\nin A4 with the sign for Manik in figure 16, _j_, the two forms are seen to\r\nbe identical. Moreover, A4 has the bar and dot coefficient 9 attached to\r\nit, that is, 4 dots and 1 bar; consequently it is clear that in A4 we have\r\nrecorded the day 9 Manik, the same day as reached by calculation. For some\r\nunknown reason, at Naranjo the month glyphs of the Initial-series terminal\r\ndates do not regularly follow the closing glyphs of the Supplementary\r\nSeries; {164} indeed, in the text here under discussion, so far as we can\r\njudge from the badly effaced glyphs, no Supplementary Series seems to have\r\nbeen recorded. However, reversing our operation, we know by calculation\r\nthat the month part should be 0 Kayab, and by referring to figure 49 we\r\nfind the only form which can be used to express the 0 position with the\r\nmonth signs--the so-called \"spectacles\" glyph--which must be recorded\r\nsomewhere in this text to express the idea 0 with the month sign Kayab.\r\nFurther, by referring to figure 19, _d'-f'_, we may fix in our minds the\r\nsign for the month Kayab, which should also appear in the text with one of\r\nthe forms shown in figure 49.\r\n\r\nReturning to our text once more and following along the glyphs after the\r\nday in A4, we pass over B4, A5, and B5 without finding a glyph resembling\r\none of the forms in figure 49 joined to figure 19, _d'-f'_; that is, 0\r\nKayab. However, in A6 such a glyph is reached, and the student will have no\r\ndifficulty in identifying the month sign with _d'-f'_ in the above figure.\r\nConsequently, we have recorded in A4, A6 the same terminal date, 9 Manik 0\r\nKayab, as determined by calculation, and may conclude, therefore, that our\r\ntext records without error the date 9.12.15.13.7 9 Manik 0 Kayab[124] of\r\nMaya chronology.\r\n\r\nThe next text presented (pl. 6, C) shows the Initial Series from Stela I at\r\nQuirigua.[125] Again, as in plate 6, A, the introducing glyph occupies the\r\nspace of four glyph-blocks, namely, A1-B2. Immediately after this, in\r\nA3-A4, is recorded the Initial-series number 9.18.10.0.0, all the period\r\nglyphs and coefficients of which are expressed by normal forms. The\r\nstudent's attention is called to the form for 0 used with the uinal and kin\r\nsigns in A4a and A4b, respectively, which differs from the form for 0\r\nrecorded with the uinal and kin signs in plate 6, A, B4, and A5,\r\nrespectively. In the latter text the 0 uinals and 0 kins were expressed by\r\nthe hand and curl form for zero shown in figure 54; in the present text,\r\nhowever, the 0 uinals and 0 kins are expressed by the form for 0 shown in\r\nfigure 47, a new feature.\r\n\r\nReducing the above number to units of the 1st order by means of Table XIII,\r\nwe have:\r\n\r\n   A3 =  9 × 144,000 = 1,296,000\r\n  B3a = 18 ×   7,200 =   129,600\r\n  B3b = 10 ×     360 =     3,600\r\n  A4a =  0 ×      20 =         0\r\n  A4b =  0 ×       1 =         0\r\n                       ---------\r\n                       1,429,200\r\n\r\nDeducting from this number all the Calendar Rounds possible, 75 {165} (see\r\nTable XVI), it may be reduced to 5,700 without affecting its value in the\r\npresent connection.\r\n\r\nApplying rules 1 and 2 (pp. 139 and 140, respectively) to this number, the\r\nday reached will be found to be 10 Ahau; and by applying rule 3 (p. 141),\r\nthe position of this day in the year will be found to be 8 Zac. Therefore,\r\nby calculation we have determined that the terminal date reached by this\r\nInitial Series is 10 Ahau 8 Zac. It remains to find this date in the text.\r\nThe regular position for the day in Initial-series terminal dates is\r\nimmediately following the last period glyph, which, as we have seen above,\r\nwas in A4b. Therefore the day glyph should be B4a. An inspection of this\r\nlatter glyph will show that it records the day 10 Ahau, both the day sign\r\nand the coefficient being unusually clear, and practically unmistakable.\r\nCompare B4a with figure 16, _e'-g'_, the sign for the day name Ahau.\r\nConsequently the day recorded agrees with the day determined by\r\ncalculation. The month glyph in this text, as mentioned on page 157,\r\nfootnote 1, occurs out of its regular position, following immediately the\r\nday of the terminal date.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned on page 153, when the month glyph in Initial-series terminal\r\ndates is _not_ to be found in its usual position, it will be found in the\r\nregular position for the month glyphs in all other kinds of dates in the\r\ninscriptions, namely, immediately following the day glyph to which it\r\nbelongs. In the present text we found that the day, 10 Ahau, was recorded\r\nin B4a; hence, since the month glyph was not recorded in its regular\r\nposition, it must be in B4b, immediately following the day glyph. By\r\ncomparing the glyph in B4b with the month signs in figure 19, it will be\r\nfound exactly like the month sign for Zac (_s-t_), and we may therefore\r\nconclude that this is our month glyph and that it is Zac. The coefficient\r\nof B4b is quite clearly 8 and the month part therefore reads, 8 Zac.\r\nCombining this with the day recorded in B4a, we have the date 10 Ahau 8\r\nZac, which corresponds with the terminal date determined by calculation.\r\nThe whole text therefore reads 9.18.10.0.0 10 Ahau 8 Zac.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 67. Signs representing the hotun, or 5-tun, period.]\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that this date 9.18.10.0.0 10 Ahau 8 Zac is just 5.0.0 (5\r\ntuns) later than the date recorded by the Initial Series on Zoömorph P at\r\nQuirigua (see pl. 6, _A_). As explained in Chapter II (pp. 33-34), the\r\ninterval between succeeding monuments at Quirigua is in every case 1,800\r\ndays, or 5 tuns. Therefore, it would seem probable that at Quirigua at\r\nleast this period was the unit used for marking the lapse of time. As each\r\n5-tun period was completed, its close was marked by the erection of a\r\nmonument, on which was recorded its ending date. Thus the writer believes\r\nZoömorph P marked the close of the 5-tun period ending 9.18.5.0.0 4 Ahau 13\r\nCeh, and Stela I, the 5-tun period next following, that ending 9.18.10.0.0\r\n{166} 10 Ahau 8 Zac. In other words, Zoömorph P and Stela I were two\r\nsuccessive time-markers, or \"period stones,\" in the chronological record at\r\nQuirigua. For this 5-tun period so conspicuously recorded in the\r\ninscriptions from the older Maya cities the writer would suggest the name\r\n_hotun_, _ho_ meaning 5 in Maya and _tun_ being the name of the 360-day\r\nperiod. This word has an etymological parallel in the Maya word for the\r\n20-tun period, _katun_, which we have seen may have been named directly\r\nfrom its numerical value, _kal_ being the word for 20 in Maya and _kaltun_\r\ncontracted to katun, thus meaning 20 tuns. Although no glyph for the\r\n_hotun_ has as yet been identified,[126] the writer is inclined to believe\r\nthat the sign in figure 67, _a, b_, which is frequently encountered in the\r\ntexts, will be found to represent this time period. The bar at the top in\r\nboth _a_ and _b_, figure 67, surely signifies 5; therefore the glyph itself\r\nmust mean \"1 tun.\" This form recalls the very unusual variant of the tun\r\nfrom Palenque (see fig. 29, _h_). Both have the wing and the () element.\r\n\r\nThe next Initial Series presented (see pl. 6, _D_) is from Stela 24 at\r\nNaranjo.[127] The text opens with the introducing glyph, which is in the\r\nsame relative position as the introducing glyph in the other Naranjo text\r\n(pl. 6, _B_) at A1. Then follows regularly in B1-B3 the number\r\n9.12.10.5.12, the numbers and period glyphs of which are all expressed by\r\nnormal forms. By this time the student should have no difficulty in\r\nrecognizing these and in determining the number as given above. Reducing\r\nthis according to rule 1, page 134, the following result should be\r\nobtained:\r\n\r\n  B1 =  9 × 144,000 = 1,296,000\r\n  A2 = 12 ×   7,200 =    86,400\r\n  B2 = 10 ×     360 =     3,600\r\n  A3 =  5 ×      20 =       100\r\n  B3 = 12 ×       1 =        12\r\n                      ---------\r\n                      1,386,112\r\n\r\nDeducting[128] from this number all the Calendar Rounds possible, 73 (see\r\npreliminary rule, p. 143, and Table XVI), we may reduce it to 572 without\r\naffecting its value in so far as the present calculations are concerned\r\n(1,386,112 - 1,385,540). First applying rule 1, page 139, and next rule 2,\r\npage 140, to this number (572), the student will find the day reached to be\r\n4 Eb. And applying rule 3, page 141, he will find that the year position\r\nreached will be 10 Yax;[129] hence, the terminal date as determined by\r\ncalculation will be 4 Eb 10 Yax.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GLYPHS REPRESENTING INITIAL SERIES, SHOWING USE OF BAR\r\nAND DOT NUMERALS AND HEAD-VARIANT PERIOD GLYPHS]\r\n\r\n{167}\r\n\r\nTurning again to the text (pl. 6, _D_), the next step (see step 5, p. 151)\r\nis to find the glyphs representing the above terminal date. In this\r\nconnection it should be remembered that the day part of an Initial-series\r\nterminal date usually follows immediately the last period glyph of the\r\nnumber. The glyph in A4, therefore, should record the day reached.\r\nComparing this form with the several day signs in figure 16, it appears\r\nthat A4 more closely resembles the sign for Eb (fig. 16, _s-u_) than any of\r\nthe others, hence the student may accept Eb as the day sign recorded in A4.\r\nThe 4 dots prefixed to this sign show that the day 4 Eb is here indicated.\r\nThe month sign, as stated on page 152, usually follows the last glyph of\r\nthe Supplementary Series; passing over B4, A5, B5, and A6, we reach the\r\nlatter glyph in B6. Compare the left half of B6 with the forms given in\r\nfigure 65. The coefficient 9 or 10 is expressed by a considerably effaced\r\nhead numeral. Immediately following the month-sign \"indicator\" is the month\r\nsign itself in A7. The student will have little difficulty in tracing its\r\nresemblance to the month Yax in figure 19, _q, r_, although in A7 the Yax\r\nelement itself appears as the prefix instead of as the superfix, as in _q_\r\nand _r_, just cited. This difference, however, is immaterial. The month\r\ncoefficient is quite clearly 10,[130] and the whole terminal date recorded\r\nwill read 4 Eb 10 Yax, which corresponds exactly with the terminal date\r\ndetermined by calculation. We may accept this text, therefore, as recording\r\nthe Initial-series date 9.12.10.5.12 4 Eb 10 Yax of Maya chronology.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing examples nothing but normal-form period glyphs have been\r\npresented, in order that the first exercises in deciphering the\r\ninscriptions may be as easy as possible. By this time, however, the student\r\nshould be sufficiently familiar with the normal forms of the period glyphs\r\nto be able to recognize them when they are present in the text, and the\r\nnext Initial Series figured will have its period glyphs expressed by head\r\nvariants.\r\n\r\nIn A, plate 7, is figured the Initial Series from Stela B at Copan.[131]\r\nThe introducing glyph appears at the head of the inscription in A1 {168}\r\nand is followed by a head-variant glyph in A2, to which is prefixed a bar\r\nand dot coefficient of 9. By its position, immediately following the\r\nintroducing glyph, we are justified in assuming that A2 records 9 cycles,\r\nand after comparing it with _d-f_, figure 25, where the head variant of the\r\ncycle sign is shown, this assumption becomes a certainty. Both heads have\r\nthe same clasped hand in the same position, across the lower part of the\r\nface, which, as explained on page 68, is the essential element of the cycle\r\nhead; therefore, A2 records 9 cycles. The next glyph, A3, should be the\r\nkatun sign, and a comparison of this form with the head variant for katun\r\nin _e-h_, figure 27, shows this to be the case. The determining\r\ncharacteristic (see p. 69) is probably the oval in the top of the head,\r\nwhich appears in both of these forms for the katun. The katun coefficient\r\nis 15 (3 bars). The next glyph, A4, should record the tuns, and by\r\ncomparing this form with the head variant for the tun sign in _e-g_, figure\r\n29, this also is found to be the case. Both heads show the same essential\r\ncharacteristic--the fleshless lower jaw (see p. 70). The coefficient is 0\r\n(compare fig. 47). The uinal head in A5 is equally unmistakable. Note the\r\nlarge curl protruding from the back part of the mouth, which was said (p.\r\n71) to be the essential element of this sign. Compare figure 31, _d-f_,\r\nwhere the head variant for the uinal is given. The coefficient of A5 is\r\nlike the coefficient of A4 (0), and we have recorded, therefore, 0 uinals.\r\nThe closing period glyph of the Initial Series in A6 is the head variant\r\nfor the kin sign. Compare this form with figure 34, _e-g_, where the kin\r\nhead is figured. The determining characteristic of this head is the\r\nsubfixial element, which appears also in the normal form for the kin sign\r\n(see fig. 34, _a_). Again, the coefficient of A6 is like the coefficient of\r\nA4 and A5, hence we have recorded here 0 kins.\r\n\r\nThe number recorded by the head-variant period glyphs and normal-form\r\nnumerals in A2-A6 is therefore 9.15.0.0.0; reducing this by means of Table\r\nXIII, we have:\r\n\r\n  A2 =  9 × 144,000 = 1,296,000\r\n  A3 = 15 ×   7,200 =   108,000\r\n  A4 =  0 ×     360 =         0\r\n  A5 =  0 ×      20 =         0\r\n  A6 =  0 ×       1 =         0\r\n                      ---------\r\n                      1,404,000\r\n\r\nDeducting from this number all the Calendar Rounds possible, 73 (see Table\r\nXVI), it may be reduced to 18,460. Applying to this number rules 1 and 2\r\n(pp. 139 and 140, respectively), the day reached will be found to be 4\r\nAhau. Applying rule 3 (p. 141), the position of 4 Ahau in the year will be\r\nfound to be 13 Yax. Therefore the terminal date determined by calculation\r\nwill be 4 Ahau 13 Yax. {169}\r\n\r\nAccording to step 5 (p. 151), the day reached should follow immediately the\r\nlast period glyph, which in this case was in A6; hence the day should be\r\nrecorded in A7. This glyph has a coefficient 4, but the glyph does not\r\nresemble either of the forms for Ahau shown in B5, plate 6, _A_, or in B4a,\r\n_C_ of the same plate. However, by comparing this glyph with the second\r\nvariant for the day sign Ahau in figure 16, _h'-i'_, the two forms will be\r\nfound to be identical, and we may accept A7 as recording the day 4 Ahau.\r\nImmediately following in A8 is the month sign, again out of its usual place\r\nas in plate 6, _C_. Comparing it with the month signs in figure 19, it will\r\nbe found to exactly correspond with the sign for Yax in _q-r_. The\r\ncoefficient is 13. Therefore the terminal date recorded, 4 Ahau 13 Yax,\r\nagrees with the terminal date reached by calculation, and the whole Initial\r\nSeries reads 9.15.0.0.0 4 Ahau 13 Yax. This date marks the close not only\r\nof a hotun in the Long Count, but of a katun as well.\r\n\r\nIn _B_, plate 7, is figured the Initial Series from Stela A at Copan.[132]\r\nThe introducing glyph appears in A1 B1, and is followed by the\r\nInitial-series number in A2-A4. The student will have no difficulty in\r\npicking out the clasped hand in A2, the oval in the top of the head in B2,\r\nthe fleshless lower jaw in A3, the large mouth curl in B3, and the flaring\r\nsubfix in A4, which are the essential elements of the head variants for the\r\ncycle, katun, tun, uinal, and kin, respectively. Compare these glyphs with\r\nfigures 25, _d-f_, 27, _e-h_, 29, _e-g_, 31, _d-f_, and 34, _e-g_,\r\nrespectively. The coefficients of these period glyphs are all normal forms\r\nand the student will have no difficulty in reading this number as\r\n9.14.19.8.0.[133]\r\n\r\nReducing this by means of Table XIII to units of the 1st order, we have:\r\n\r\n  A2 =  9 × 144,000 = 1,296,000\r\n  B2 = 14 ×   7,200 =   100,800\r\n  A3 = 19 ×     360 =     6,840\r\n  B3 =  8 ×      20 =       160\r\n  A4 =  0 ×       1 =         0\r\n                      ---------\r\n                      1,403,800\r\n\r\nDeducting from this all the Calendar Rounds possible, 73 (see Table XVI),\r\nand applying rules 1 and 2 (pp. 139 and 140, respectively), to the\r\nremainder, the day reached will be 12 Ahau. And applying rule 3 (p. 141),\r\nthe month reached will be 18 Cumhu, giving for the terminal date as reached\r\nby calculation 12 Ahau 18 Cumhu. The day should be recorded in B4, and an\r\nexamination of this glyph shows that its coefficient is 12, the day\r\ncoefficient reached by calculation. The glyph itself, however, is unlike\r\nthe forms for Ahau previously encountered in plate 6, _A_, B5 and _C_, B4b,\r\nand in plate 7, _A_, A7. Turning {170} now to the forms for the day sign\r\nAhau in figure 16, it is seen that the form in A4 resembles the third\r\nvariant _j_' or _k'_, the grotesque head, and it is clear that the day 12\r\nAhau is here recorded. At first sight the student might think that the\r\nmonth glyph follows in A5, but a closer inspection of this form shows that\r\nthis is not the case. In the first place, since the day sign is Ahau the\r\nmonth coefficient must be either 3, 8, 13, or 18, not 7, as recorded (see\r\nTable VII), and, in the second place, the glyph itself in A5 bears no\r\nresemblance whatsoever to any of the month signs in figure 19. Consequently\r\nthe month part of the Initial-series terminal date of this text should\r\nfollow the closing glyph of the Supplementary Series. Following along the\r\nglyphs next in order, we reach in A9 a glyph with a coefficient 9, although\r\nthe sign itself bears no resemblance to the month-glyph \"indicators\"\r\nheretofore encountered (see fig. 65).\r\n\r\nThe glyph following, however, in A9b is quite clearly 18 Cumhu (see fig.\r\n19, _g'-h'_), which is the month part of the terminal date as reached by\r\ncalculation. Therefore, since A9a has the coefficient 9 it is probable that\r\nit is a variant of the month-glyph \"indicator\";[134] and consequently that\r\nthe month glyph itself follows, as we have seen, in B9. In other words, the\r\nterminal date recorded, 12 Ahau 18 Cumhu, agrees with the terminal date\r\nreached by calculation, and the whole text, so far as it can be deciphered,\r\nreads 9.14.19.8.0 12 Ahau 18 Cumhu. The student will note that this Initial\r\nSeries precedes the Initial Series in plate 7, _A_ by exactly 10 uinals, or\r\n200 days. Compare _A_ and _B_, plate 7.\r\n\r\nIn plate 8, _A_, is figured the Initial Series from Stela 6 at Copan.[135]\r\nThe introducing glyph occupies the space of four glyph-blocks, A1-B2, and\r\nthere follows in A3-B4a the Initial-series number 9.12.10.0.0. The cycle\r\nglyph in A3 is partially effaced; the clasped hand, however, the\r\ndetermining characteristic of the cycle head, may still be distinguished.\r\nThe katun head in B3 is also unmistakable, as it has the same superfix as\r\nin the normal form for the katun. At first sight the student might read the\r\nbar and dot coefficient as 14, but the two middle crescents are purely\r\ndecorative and have no numerical value, and the numeral recorded here is 12\r\n(see pp. 88-91). Although the tun and uinal period glyphs in A4a and\r\nA4b,[136] respectively, are effaced, their coefficients may be\r\ndistinguished as 10 and 0, respectively. In such a case the student is\r\nperfectly justified in assuming that the tun and uinal signs originally\r\nstood here. In B4a the kin period glyph is expressed by its normal form and\r\nthe kin coefficient by a head-variant numeral, the clasped hand of which\r\nindicates that it stands for 0 (see fig. 53, _s-w_).[137] The number here\r\nrecorded is 9.12.10.0.0.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GLYPHS REPRESENTING INITIAL SERIES, SHOWING USE OF BAR\r\nAND DOT NUMERALS AND HEAD-VARIANT PERIOD GLYPHS]\r\n\r\n{171}\r\n\r\nReducing this to units of the 1st order by means of Table XIII, we have:\r\n\r\n   A3 =  9 × 144,000 = 1,296,000\r\n   B3 = 12 ×   7,200 =    86,400\r\n  A4a = 10 ×     360 =     3,600\r\n  A4b =  0 ×      20 =         0\r\n  B4a =  0 ×       1 =         0\r\n                       ---------\r\n                       1,386,000\r\n\r\nDeducting from this number all the Calendar Rounds possible, 73 (see Table\r\nXVI), and applying to the remainder rules 1, 2, and 3 (pp. 139-141),\r\nrespectively, the date reached by the resulting calculations will be 9 Ahau\r\n18 Zotz. Turning to our text again, the student will have little difficulty\r\nin identifying B4b as 9 Ahau, the day of the above terminal date. The form\r\nAhau here recorded is the grotesque head, the third variant _j'_ or _k'_ in\r\nfigure 16. Following the next glyphs in order, A5-A6, the closing glyph of\r\nthe Supplementary Series is reached in B6a. Compare this glyph with the\r\nforms in figure 65. The coefficient of B6a is again a head-variant numeral,\r\nas in the case of the kin period glyph in B4a, above. The fleshless lower\r\njaw and other skull-like characteristics indicate that the numeral 10 is\r\nhere recorded. Compare B6a with figure 52, _m-r_. Since B6a is the last\r\nglyph of the Supplementary Series, the next glyph B6b should represent the\r\nmonth sign. By comparing the latter form with the month signs in figure 19\r\nthe student will readily recognize that the sign for Zotz in _e_ or _f_ is\r\nthe month sign here recorded. The coefficient 18 stands above.\r\nConsequently, B4b and B6b represent the same terminal date, 9 Ahau 18 Zotz,\r\nas reached by calculation. This whole Initial Series reads 9.12.10.0.0 9\r\nAhau 18 Zotz, and according to the writer's view, the monument upon which\r\nit occurs (Stela 6 at Copan) was the period stone for the hotun which began\r\nwith the day 9.12.5.0.1 4 Imix 4 Xul[138] and ended with the day\r\n9.12.10.0.0 9 Ahau 18 Zotz, here recorded.\r\n\r\nIn plate 8, _B_, is figured the Initial Series from Stela 9 at Copan.[139]\r\nThe introducing glyph stands in A1-B2 and is followed by the five period\r\nglyphs in A3-A5. The cycle is very clearly recorded in A3, the clasped hand\r\nbeing of a particularly realistic form. Although {172} the coefficient is\r\npartially effaced, enough remains to show that it was above 5, having had\r\noriginally more than the one bar which remains, and less than 11, there\r\nbeing space for only one more bar or row of dots. In all the previous\r\nInitial Series the cycle coefficient was 9, consequently it is reasonable\r\nto assume that 4 dots originally occupied the effaced part of this glyph.\r\nIf the use of 9 cycles in this number gives a terminal date which agrees\r\nwith the terminal date recorded, the above assumption becomes a certainty.\r\nIn B3 six katuns are recorded. Note the ornamental dotted ovals on each\r\nside of the dot in the numeral 6. Although the head for the tun in A4 is\r\npartially effaced, we are warranted in assuming that this was the period\r\noriginally recorded here. The coefficient 10 appears clearly. The uinal\r\nhead in B4 is totally unfamiliar and seems to have the fleshless lower jaw\r\nproperly belonging to the tun head; from its position, however, the 4th in\r\nthe number, we are justified in calling this glyph the uinal sign. Its\r\ncoefficient denotes that 0 uinals are recorded here. Although the period\r\nglyph in A5 is also entirely effaced, the coefficient appears clearly as 0,\r\nand from position again, 5th in the number, we are justified once more in\r\nassuming that 0 kins were originally recorded, here. It seems at first\r\nglance that the above reading of the number A3-A5 rests on several\r\nassumptions:\r\n\r\n  1. That the cycle coefficient was originally 9.\r\n  2. That the effaced glyph in A4 was a tun head.\r\n  3. That the irregular head in B4 is a uinal head.\r\n  4. That the effaced glyph in A5 was a kin sign.\r\n\r\nThe last three are really certainties, since the Maya practice in recording\r\nInitial Series demanded that the five period glyphs requisite--the cycle,\r\nkatun, tun, uinal, and kin--should follow each other in this order, and in\r\nno other. Hence, although the 3d, 4th, and 5th glyphs are either irregular\r\nor effaced, they must have been the tun, uinal, and kin signs,\r\nrespectively. Indeed, the only important assumption consisted in\r\narbitrarily designating the cycle coefficient 9, when, so far as the\r\nappearance of A3 is concerned, it might have been either 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10.\r\nThe reason for choosing 9 rests on the overwhelming evidence of antecedent\r\nprobability. Moreover, as stated above, if the terminal date recorded\r\nagrees with the terminal date determined by calculation, using the cycle\r\ncoefficient as 9, our assumption becomes a certainty. Designating the above\r\nnumber as 9.6.10.0.0 then and reducing this by means of Table XIII, we\r\nobtain:\r\n\r\n  A3 =  9 × 144,000 = 1,296,000\r\n  B3 =  6 ×   7,200 =    43,200\r\n  A4 = 10 ×     360 =     3,600\r\n  B4 =  0 ×      20 =         0\r\n  A5 =  0 ×       1 =         0\r\n                      ---------\r\n                      1,342,800\r\n\r\n{173} Deducting from this number all the Calendar Rounds possible, 70 (see\r\nTable XVI), and applying rules 1, 2, and 3 (pp. 139, 140, and 141,\r\nrespectively) to the remainder, the date determined by the resulting\r\ncalculations will be 8 Ahau 13 Pax. Turning to our text again, the student\r\nwill have little difficulty in recognizing the first part of this date, the\r\nday 8 Ahau, in B5. The numeral 8 appears clearly, and the day sign is the\r\nprofile-head _h'_ or _i'_, the second variant for Ahau in figure 16. The\r\nsignificance of the element standing between the numeral and the day sign\r\nis unknown. Following along through A6, B6, A7, B7, the closing glyph of\r\nthe Supplementary Series is reached in A8. The glyph itself is on the left\r\nand the coefficient, here expressed by a head variant, is on the right. The\r\nstudent will have no difficulty in recognizing the glyph and its\r\ncoefficient by comparing the former with figure 65, and the latter with the\r\nhead variant for 10 in figure 52, _m-r_. Note the fleshless lower jaw in\r\nthe head numeral in both places. The following glyph, B8, is one of the\r\nclearest in the entire text. The numeral is 13, and the month sign on\r\ncomparison with figure 19 unmistakably proves itself to be the sign for Pax\r\nin _c'_. Therefore the terminal date recorded in B5, B8, namely, 8 Ahau 13\r\nPax, agrees with the terminal date determined by calculation; it follows,\r\nfurther, that the effaced cycle coefficient in A3 must have been 9, the\r\nvalue tentatively ascribed to it in the above calculations. The whole\r\nInitial Series reads 9.6.10.0.0 8 Ahau 13 Pax.\r\n\r\nSome of the peculiarities of the numerals and signs in this text are\r\ndoubtless due to its very great antiquity, for the monument presenting this\r\ninscription, Stela 9, records the next to earliest Initial Series[140] yet\r\ndeciphered at Copan.[141] Evidences of antiquity appear in the glyphs in\r\nseveral different ways. The bars denoting 5 have square ends and all show\r\nconsiderable ornamentation. This type of bar was an early manifestation and\r\ngave way in later times to more rounded forms. The dots also show this\r\ngreater ornamentation, which is reflected, too, by the signs themselves.\r\nThe head forms show greater attention to detail, giving the whole glyph a\r\nmore ornate appearance. All this embellishment gave way in later times to\r\nmore simplified forms, and we have represented in this text a stage in\r\nglyph morphology before conventionalization had worn down the different\r\nsigns to little more than their essential elements. {174}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 68. Initial Series showing bar and dot numerals and\r\nhead-variant period glyphs: _A_, Stela C (west side), Quirigua; _B_, Stela\r\nM, Copan.]\r\n\r\nIn figure 68, _A_, is figured the Initial Series on the west side of Stela\r\nC at Quirigua.[142] The introducing glyph in A1-B2 is followed by the\r\nnumber in A3-A5, which the student will have no difficulty in reading\r\nexcept for the head-variant numeral attached to the kin sign in A5. The\r\nclasped hand in this glyph, however, suggests that 0 kins are recorded\r\nhere, and a comparison of this form with figure 53, _s-w_, confirms the\r\nsuggestion. The number therefore reads 9.1.0.0.0. Reducing this number by\r\nmeans of Table XIII to units of the 1st order, we obtain:\r\n\r\n  A3 = 9 × 144,000 = 1,296,000\r\n  B3 = 1 ×   7,200 =     7,200\r\n  A4 = 0 ×     360 =         0\r\n  B4 = 0 ×      20 =         0\r\n  A5 = 0 ×       1 =         0\r\n                     ---------\r\n                     1,303,200\r\n\r\nDeducting from this number all the Calendar Rounds possible, 68 (see Table\r\nXVI), and applying rules 1, 2, and 3 (pp. 139, 140, and 141, respectively)\r\nto the remainder, we reach for the terminal date 6 Ahau 13 Yaxkin. Looking\r\nfor the day part of this date in B5, we find that the form there recorded\r\nbears no resemblance to 6 Ahau, the day determined by calculation.\r\nMoreover, comparison of it with the day signs in figure 16 shows that it is\r\nunlike all of them; further, there is {175} no bar and dot coefficient.\r\nThese several points indicate that the day sign is not the glyph in B5,\r\nalso that the day sign is, therefore, out of its regular position. The next\r\nglyph in the text, A6, instead of being one of the Supplementary Series is\r\nthe day glyph 6 Ahau, which should have been recorded in B5. The student\r\nwill readily make the same identification after comparing A6 with figure\r\n16, _e'-g'_. A glance at the remainder of the text, will show that no\r\nSupplementary Series is recorded, and consequently that the month glyph\r\nwill be found immediately following the day glyph in B6. The form in B6 has\r\na coefficient 13, one of the four (3, 8, 13, 18) which the month must have,\r\nsince the day sign is Ahau (see Table VII). A comparison of the form in B6\r\nwith the month signs in figure 19 shows that the month Yaxkin in _k_ or _l_\r\nis the form here recorded; therefore the terminal date recorded agrees with\r\nthe terminal date reached by calculation, and the text reads 9.1.0.0.0 6\r\nAhau 13 Yaxkin.[143]\r\n\r\nIn figure 68, _B_, is shown the Initial Series on Stela M at Copan.[144]\r\nThe introducing glyph appears in A1 and the Initial-series number in\r\nB1a-B2a. The student will note the use of both normal-form and head-variant\r\nperiod glyphs in this text, the cycle, tun, and uinal in B1a, A2a, and A2b,\r\nrespectively, being expressed by the latter, and the katun and kin in B1b\r\nand B2a, respectively, by the former. The number recorded is 9.16.5.0.0,\r\nand this reduces to units of the first order, as follows (see Table XIII):\r\n\r\n  B1a =  9 × 144,000 = 1,296,000\r\n  B1b = 16 ×   7,200 =   115,200\r\n  A2a =  5 ×     360 =     1,800\r\n  A2b =  0 ×      20 =         0\r\n  B2a =  0 ×       1 =         0\r\n                       ---------\r\n                       1,413,000\r\n\r\nDeducting from this number all the Calendar Rounds possible, 74 (see Table\r\nXVI), and applying rules 1, 2, and 3 (pp. 139, 140, and 141, respectively)\r\nto the remainder, the terminal date reached by the resulting calculations\r\nwill be 8 Ahau 8 Zotz. Turning to our text, the student will have no\r\ndifficulty in recognizing in B2b the day 8 Ahau. The month glyph in this\r\ninscription irregularly follows immediately {176} the day glyph. Compare\r\nthe form in A3a with the month signs in figure 19 and it will be found to\r\nbe the sign for Zotz (see fig. 19, _e-f_). The coefficient is 8 and the\r\nwhole glyph represents the month part 8 Zotz, the same as determined by\r\ncalculation. This whole Initial Series reads 9.16.5.0.0 8 Ahau 8 Zotz.\r\n\r\nThe Maya texts presented up to this point have all been drawings of\r\noriginals, which are somewhat easier to make out than either photographs of\r\nthe originals or the originals themselves. However, in order to familiarize\r\nthe student with photographic reproductions of Maya texts a few will be\r\ninserted here illustrating the use of bar and dot numerals with both\r\nnormal-form and head-variant period glyphs, with which the student should\r\nbe perfectly familiar by this time.\r\n\r\nIn plate 9, _A_, is figured a photograph of the Initial Series on the front\r\nof Stela 11 at Yaxchilan.[145] The introducing glyph appears in A1 B1; 9\r\ncycles in A2; 16 katuns in B2, 1 tun in A3, 0 uinals in B3, and 0 kins in\r\nB4. The student will note the clasped hand in the cycle head, the oval in\r\nthe top of the katun head, the large mouth curl in the uinal head, and the\r\nflaring postfix in the kin head. The tun is expressed by its normal form.\r\nThe number here recorded is 9.16.1.0.0, and reducing this to units of the\r\nfirst order by means of Table XIII, we have:\r\n\r\n  A2 =  9 × 144,000 = 1,296,000\r\n  B2 = 16 ×   7,200 =   115,200\r\n  A3 =  1 ×     360 =       360\r\n  B3 =  0 ×      20 =         0\r\n  A4 =  0 ×       1 =         0\r\n                      ---------\r\n                      1,411,560\r\n\r\nDeducting from this number all the Calendar Rounds possible, 74 (see Table\r\nXVI), and applying rules 1, 2, and 3 (pp. 139, 140, and 141, respectively),\r\nto the remainder, the terminal date reached by the resulting calculations\r\nwill be 11 Ahau 8 Tzec. The day part of this date is very clearly recorded\r\nin B4 immediately after the last period glyph, and the student will readily\r\nrecognize the day 11 Ahau in this form. Following along the glyphs of the\r\nSupplementary Series in C1 D1, C2 D2, the closing glyph is reached in C3b.\r\nIt is very clear and has a coefficient of 9. The glyph following (D3)\r\nshould record the month sign. A comparison of this form with the several\r\nmonth signs in figure 19 shows that Tzec is the month here recorded.\r\nCompare D3 with figure 19, _g-h_. The month coefficient is 8. The terminal\r\ndate, therefore, recorded in B4 and D3 (11 Ahau 8 Tzec) agrees with the\r\nterminal date determined by calculation, and this whole text reads\r\n9.16.1.0.0 11 Ahau 8 Tzec. The meaning of the element between the tun\r\ncoefficient and the tun sign in A3, which is repeated again in D3 between\r\nthe month coefficient and the month sign, is unknown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GLYPHS REPRESENTING INITIAL SERIES, SHOWING USE OF BAR\r\nAND DOT NUMERALS AND HEAD-VARIANT PERIOD GLYPHS]\r\n\r\n{177}\r\n\r\nIn plate 9, _B_, is figured the Initial Series on an altar in front of\r\nStructure 44 at Yaxchilan.[146] The introducing glyph appears in A1 B1 and\r\nis followed by the number in A2-A4. The period glyphs are all expressed as\r\nhead variants and the coefficients as bar and dot numerals. Excepting the\r\nkin coefficient in A4, the number is quite easily read as 9.12.8.14.? An\r\ninspection of our text shows that the coefficient must be 0, 1, 2, or 3.\r\nLet us work out the terminal dates for all four of these values, commencing\r\nwith 0, and then see which of the resulting terminal days is the one\r\nactually recorded in A4. Reducing the number 9.12.8.14.0 to units of the\r\nfirst order by means of Table XIII, we have:\r\n\r\n  A2 = 9 × 144,000 = 1,296,000\r\n  B2 = 12 ×  7,200 =    86,400\r\n  A3=  8 ×     360 =     2,880\r\n  B3 = 14 ×     20 =       280\r\n  A4=  0 ×       1 =         0\r\n                     ---------\r\n                     1,385,560\r\n\r\nDeducting from this number all the Calendar Rounds possible, 73 (see Table\r\nXVI), and applying rules 1, 2, and 3 (pp. 139, 140, and 141, respectively),\r\nto the remainder, the terminal day reached will be 11 Ahau 3 Pop. Therefore\r\nthe Initial-series numbers 9.12.8.14.1, 9.12.8.14.2, and 9.12.8.14.3 will\r\nlead to the three days immediately following 9.12.8.14.0 11 Ahau 3 Pop.\r\nTherefore our four possible terminal dates will be:\r\n\r\n  9.12.8.14.0      11 Ahau  3 Pop\r\n  9.12.8.14.1      12 Imix  4 Pop <------\r\n  9.12.8.14.2      13 Ik    5 Pop\r\n  9.12.8.14.3       1 Akbal 6 Pop\r\n\r\nNow let us look for one of these four terminal dates in the text. The day\r\nreached by an Initial Series is almost invariably recorded immediately\r\nafter the last period glyph; therefore, if this inscription is regular, the\r\nday glyph should be B4. This glyph probably has the coefficient 12 (2 bars\r\nand 2 numerical dots), the oblong element between probably being ornamental\r\nonly. This number must be either 11 or 12, since if it were 13 the 3 dots\r\nwould all be of the same size, which is not the case. An inspection of the\r\ncoefficient in B4 eliminates from consideration, therefore, the last two of\r\nthe above four possible terminal dates, and reduces the possible values for\r\nthe kin coefficient in A4 to 0 or 1. Comparing the glyph in B4 with the day\r\nsigns in figure 16, the form here recorded will be found to be identical\r\nwith the sign for Imix in figure 16, a. This eliminates the first terminal\r\ndate above and leaves the second, the day part of which {178} we have just\r\nseen appears in B4. This further proves that the kin coefficient in A4 is\r\n1. The final confirmation of this identification will come from the month\r\nglyph, which must be 4 Pop if we have correctly identified the day as 12\r\nImix. If, on the other hand, the day were 11 Ahau, the month glyph would be\r\n3 Pop. Passing over A5 B5, A6 B6, C1 D1, and C2, we, reach in D2a the\r\nclosing glyph of the Supplementary Series, here showing the coefficient 9.\r\nCompare this form with figure 65. The month glyph, therefore, should appear\r\nin D2b. The coefficient of this glyph is very clearly 4, thus confirming\r\nour identification of B4 as 12 Imix. (See Table VII.) And finally, the\r\nmonth glyph itself is Pop. Compare D2b with figure 19, a. The whole Initial\r\nSeries in plate 9, _B_, therefore reads 9.12.8.14.1 12 Imix 4 Pop.\r\n\r\nIn plate 10, is figured the Initial Series from Stela 3 at Tikal.[147] The\r\nintroducing glyph, though somewhat effaced, may still be recognized in A1.\r\nThe Initial-series number follows in B1-B3. The head-variant period glyphs\r\nare too badly weathered to show the determining characteristic in each\r\ncase, except the uinal head in A3, the mouth curl of which appears clearly,\r\nand their identification rests on their relative positions with reference\r\nto the introducing glyph. The reliability of this basis of identification\r\nfor the period glyphs of Initial Series has been thoroughly tested in the\r\ntexts already presented and is further confirmed in this very inscription\r\nby the uinal head. Even if the large mouth curl of the head in A3 had not\r\nproved that the uinal was recorded here, we should have assumed this to be\r\nthe case because this glyph, A3, is the fourth from the introducing glyph.\r\nThe presence of the mouth curl therefore confirms the identification based\r\non position. The student will have no difficulty in reading the number\r\nrecorded in B1-B3 as 9.2.13.0.0.\r\n\r\nReducing this number by means of Table XIII to units of the first order, we\r\nobtain:\r\n\r\n  B1 =  9 × 144,000 = 1,296,000\r\n  A2 =  2 ×   7,200 =    14,400\r\n  B2 = 13 ×     360 =     4,680\r\n  A3 =  0 ×      20 =         0\r\n  B3 =  0 ×       1 =         0\r\n                      ---------\r\n                      1,315,080\r\n\r\nDeducting all the Calendar Rounds possible from this number, 69 (see Table\r\nXVI), and applying rules 1, 2, and 3 (pp. 139, 140, and 141, respectively)\r\nto the remainder, the terminal date reached will be 4 Ahau 13 Kayab. It\r\nremains to find this date in the text. The glyph in A4, the proper position\r\nfor the day glyph, is somewhat effaced, though the profile of the human\r\nhead may yet be traced, thus enabling us to identify this form as the day\r\nsign Ahau. Compare figure 16, _h', i'_. The coefficient of A4 is very\r\nclearly 4 dots, that is, 4, and consequently this glyph agrees with the day\r\nas determined by calculation, 4 Ahau. Passing over B4, A5, B5, and A6, we\r\nreach in B6 the closing glyph of the Supplementary Series, here recorded\r\nwith a coefficient of 9. Compare B6 with figure 65. The month glyph follows\r\nin A7 with the coefficient 13. Comparing this latter glyph with the month\r\nsigns in figure 19, it is evident that the month Kayab (fig. 19, _d'-f'_)\r\nis recorded in A7, which reads, therefore, 13 Kayab. Hence the whole text\r\nrecords the Initial Series 9.2.13.0.0 4 Ahau 13 Kayab.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GLYPHS REPRESENTING INITIAL SERIES, SHOWING USE OF BAR\r\nAND DOT NUMERALS AND HEAD-VARIANT PERIOD GLYPHS--STELA 3, TIKAL]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GLYPHS REPRESENTING INITIAL SERIES, SHOWING USE OF BAR\r\nAND DOT NUMERALS AND HEAD-VARIANT PERIOD GLYPHS--STELA A (EAST SIDE),\r\nQUIRIGUA]\r\n\r\n{179}\r\n\r\nThis Initial Series is extremely important, because it records the earliest\r\ncontemporaneous[148] date yet found on a monument[149] in the Maya\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nIn plate 11 is figured the Initial Series from the east side of Stela A at\r\nQuirigua.[150] The introducing glyph appears in A1-B2 and the\r\nInitial-series number in A3-A5. The student will have little difficulty in\r\npicking out the clasped hand in A3, the oval in the top of the head in B3,\r\nthe fleshless lower jaw in A4, the mouth curl in B4, as the essential\r\ncharacteristic of the cycle, katun, tun, and uinal heads, respectively. The\r\nkin head in A5 is the banded-headdress variant (compare fig. 34, _i, j_),\r\nand this completes the number, which is 9.17.5.0.0. Reducing this by means\r\nof Table XIII to units of the first order, we have:\r\n\r\n  A3 =  9 × 144,000 = 1,296,000\r\n  B3 = 17 ×   7,200 =   122,400\r\n  A4 =  5 ×     360 =     1,800\r\n  B4 =  0 ×      20 =         0\r\n  A5 =  0 ×       0 =         0\r\n                      ---------\r\n                      1,420,200\r\n\r\nDeducting from this number all the Calendar Rounds possible, 73 (see Table\r\nXVI), and applying rules 1, 2, and 3 (pp. 139, 140, and 141, {180}\r\nrespectively) to the remainder, the terminal day reached will be found to\r\nbe 6 Ahau 13 Kayab.\r\n\r\nIn B5 the profile variant of the day sign, Ahau, is clearly recorded (fig.\r\n16, _h', i'_), and to it is attached a head-variant numeral. Comparing this\r\nwith the head-variant numerals in figures 51-53, the student will have\r\nlittle difficulty in identifying it as the head for 6 (see fig. 51, _t-v_).\r\nNote the so-called \"hatchet eye\" in A5, which is the determining\r\ncharacteristic of the head for 6 (see p. 99). Passing over A6 B6, A7 B7, A8\r\nB8, we reach in A9 the closing glyph of the Supplementary Series, here\r\nshowing the head-variant coefficient 10 (see fig. 52, _m-r_). In B9, the\r\nnext glyph, is recorded the month 13 Kayab (see fig. 19, _d'-f'_). The\r\nwhole Initial Series therefore reads 9.17.5.0.0 6 Ahau 13 Kayab.\r\n\r\nAll the Initial Series heretofore presented have had normal-form numerals\r\nwith the exception of an incidental head-variant number here and there. By\r\nthis time the student should have become thoroughly familiar with the use\r\nof bar and dot numerals in the inscriptions and should be ready for the\r\npresentation of texts showing head-variant numerals, a more difficult group\r\nof glyphs to identify.\r\n\r\nIn plate 12, _A_, is figured the Initial Series on the tablet from the\r\nTemple of the Foliated Cross at Palenque.[151] The introducing glyph\r\nappears in A1 B2, and is followed by the Initial-series number in A3-B7.\r\nThe student will have little difficulty in identifying the heads in B3, B4,\r\nB5, B6, and B7 as the head variants for the cycle, katun, tun, uinal, and\r\nkin, respectively. The head in A3 prefixed to the cycle glyph in B3 has for\r\nits determining characteristic the forehead ornament composed of _more than\r\none part_ (here, of two parts). As explained on page 97, this is the\r\nessential element of the head for 1. Compare A3 with figure 51, _a-e_, and\r\nthe two glyphs will be found to be identical. We may conclude, therefore,\r\nthat in place of the usual 9 cycles heretofore encountered in Initial\r\nSeries, we have recorded in A3-B3 1 cycle.[152] The katun coefficient in A4\r\nresembles closely the cycle coefficient except that its forehead ornament\r\nis composed of but a single part, a large curl. As explained on page 97,\r\nthe heads for 1 and 8 are very similar, and are to be distinguished from\r\neach other only by their forehead ornaments, the former having a forehead\r\nornament composed of more than one part, as in A3, and the latter a\r\nforehead ornament composed of but one part, as here in A4. This head,\r\nmoreover, is very similar to the head for 8 in figure 52, _a-f_; indeed,\r\nthe only difference is that the former has a fleshless lower jaw. This is\r\nthe essential element of the head for 10 (see p. 100); when applied to the\r\nhead for any other numeral it increases the value of the resulting head by\r\n10. Therefore we have recorded in A4 B4, 18 (8 + 10) katuns. The tun\r\ncoefficient in A5 has for its determining characteristic the tun headdress,\r\nwhich, as explained on page 99, is the essential element of the head for 5\r\n(see fig. 51, _n-s_). Therefore A5 represents 5, and A5 B5, 5 tuns. The\r\nuinal coefficient in A6 has for its essential elements the large bulging\r\neye, square irid, and snaglike front tooth. As stated on page 98, these\r\ncharacterize the head for 4, examples of which are given in figure 51,\r\n_j-m_. Consequently, A6 B6 records 4 uinals. The kin coefficient in A7 is\r\nquite clearly 0. The student will readily recognize the clasped hand, which\r\nis the determining characteristic of the 0 head (see p. 101 and fig. 53,\r\n_s-w_). The number recorded in A3-B7 is, therefore, 1.18.5.4.0. Reducing\r\nthis number to units of the 1st order by means of Table XIII, we obtain:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GLYPHS REPRESENTING INITIAL SERIES, SHOWING USE OF\r\nHEAD-VARIANT NUMERALS AND PERIOD GLYPHS]\r\n\r\n{181}\r\n\r\n  A3B3 =  1 × 144,000 = 144,000\r\n  A4B4 = 18 ×   7,200 = 129,600\r\n  A5B5 =  5 ×     360 =   1,800\r\n  A6B6 =  4 ×      20 =      80\r\n  A7B7 =  0 ×       1 =       0\r\n                        -------\r\n                        275,480\r\n\r\nDeducting from this number all the Calendar Rounds possible, 14 (see Table\r\nXVI), and applying rules 1, 2, and 3 (pp. 139, 140, and 141, respectively),\r\nthe terminal date reached will be 1 Ahau 13 Mac. Of this date, the day\r\npart, 1 Ahau, is recorded very clearly in A8 B8. Compare the head in A8\r\nwith the head in A3, which, we have seen, stood for 1 and also with figure\r\n51, _a-e_, and the head in B8 with figure 16, _h', i'_, the profile head\r\nfor the day sign Ahau. This text is irregular in that the month glyph\r\nfollows immediately the day glyph, i.e., in A9. The glyph in A9 has a\r\ncoefficient 13, which agrees with the month coefficient determined by\r\ncalculation, and a comparison of B9 with the forms for the months in figure\r\n19 shows that the month Mac (fig. 19, _w, x_) is here recorded. The whole\r\nInitial Series therefore reads 1.18.5.4.0 1 Ahau 13 Mac.\r\n\r\nIn plate 12, _B_, is figured the Initial Series on the tablet from the\r\nTemple of the Sun at Palenque.[153] The introducing glyph appears in A1-B2\r\nand is followed by the Initial-series number in A3-B7. The student will\r\nhave no difficulty in identifying the period glyphs in B3, B4, B5, B6, and\r\nB7; and the cycle, katun, and tun coefficients in A3, A4, and A5,\r\nrespectively, will be found to be exactly like the corresponding\r\ncoefficients in the preceding Initial Series (pl. 12, _A_, A3, A4, A5),\r\nwhich, as we have seen, record the numbers 1, 18, and 5, respectively. The\r\nuinal coefficient in A6, however, presents a new form. Here the determining\r\ncharacteristic is the banded headdress, or fillet, which distinguishes the\r\nhead for 3, as explained on page 98 (see fig. 51 _h, i_). We have then in\r\nA6 B6 record of 3 {182} uinals. The kin coefficient in A7 is very clearly\r\n6. Note the \"hatchet eye,\" which, as explained on page 99, is the essential\r\nelement of this head numeral, and also compare it with figure 51, _t-v_.\r\nThe number recorded in A3-B7 therefore is 1.18.5.3.6. Reducing this to\r\nunits of the first order by means of Table XIII, we obtain:\r\n\r\n  A3B3 =  1 × 144,000 = 144,000\r\n  A4B4 = 18 ×   7,200 = 129,600\r\n  A5B5 =  5 ×     360 =   1,800\r\n  A6B6 =  3 ×      20 =      60\r\n  A7B7 =  6 ×       1 =       6\r\n                        -------\r\n                        275,466\r\n\r\nDeducting from this number all the Calendar Rounds possible, 14 (see Table\r\nXVI), and applying rules 1, 2, and 3 (pp. 139, 140, and 141), respectively,\r\nto the remainder, the terminal date reached will be 13 Cimi 19 Ceh. If this\r\ninscription is regular, the day part of the above date should follow in A8\r\nB8, the former expressing the coefficient and the latter the day sign.\r\nComparing A8 with the head numerals in figures 51-53, it will be found to\r\nbe like the second variant for 13 in figure 52, _x-b'_, the essential\r\nelement of which seems to be the pendulous nose surmounted by a curl, the\r\nprotruding mouth fang, and the large bulging eye. Comparing the glyph in B8\r\nwith the day signs in figure 16, it will be seen that the form here\r\nrecorded is the day sign Cimi (fig. 16, _h, i_). Therefore A8 B8 expresses\r\nthe day 13 Cimi. The month glyph is recorded very irregularly in this text,\r\nsince it occurs neither immediately after the Supplementary Series or the\r\nday sign, but the second glyph after the day sign, in B9. A comparison of\r\nthis form with figure 19, _u-v_, shows that the month Ceh is recorded here.\r\nThe coefficient is 19. Why the glyph in A9 should stand between the day and\r\nits month glyph is unknown; this case constitutes one of the many unsolved\r\nproblems in the study of the Maya glyphs. This whole Initial Series reads\r\n1.18.5.3.6 13 Cimi 19 Ceh.\r\n\r\nThe student will note that this Initial Series records a date 14 days\r\nearlier than the preceding Initial Series (pl. 12, _A_). That two dates\r\nshould be recorded which were within 14 days of each other, and yet were\r\nmore than 3,000 years earlier than practically all other Maya dates, is a\r\npuzzling problem. These two Initial Series from the Temple of the Sun and\r\nthat of the Foliated Cross at Palenque, together with a Secondary-series\r\ndate from the Temple of the Cross in the same city, have been thoroughly\r\nreviewed by Mr. Bowditch (1906). The conclusions he reaches and the\r\nexplanation he offers to account for the occurrence of three dates so\r\nremote as these are very reasonable, and, the writer believes, will be\r\ngenerally accepted by Maya students. {183}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 69. Initial Series showing head-variant numerals and\r\nperiod glyphs: _A_, House C of the Palace Group at Palenque; _B_, Stela P\r\nat Copan.]\r\n\r\nIn figure 69, _A_, is shown the Initial Series inscribed on the rises and\r\ntreads of the stairway leading to House C in the Palace at Palenque.[154]\r\nThe introducing glyph is recorded in A1, and the Initial-series number\r\nfollows in B1-B3. The student will readily recognize the period glyphs in\r\nB1b, A2b, B2b, A3b, and B3b. The head expressing the cycle coefficient in\r\nB1a has for its essential element the dots centering around the corner of\r\nthe mouth. As explained on page 100, this characterizes the head for 9 (see\r\nfig. 52, _g-l_, where variants for the 9 head are figured). In B1,\r\ntherefore, we have recorded 9 cycles, the number almost always found in\r\nInitial Series as the cycle coefficient. The essential element of the katun\r\ncoefficient in A2a is the forehead ornament composed of a single part. This\r\ndenotes the head for 8 (see p. 100, and fig. 52, _a-f_; also compare A2a\r\nwith the heads denoting 18 in the two preceding examples, pl. 12, _A_, A4,\r\nand pl. 12, _B_, A4, each of which shows the same forehead ornament). The\r\ntun coefficient in B2a is exactly like the cycle coefficient just above it\r\nin B1a; that is, 9, having the same dotting of the face near the corner of\r\nthe mouth. The uinal coefficient in A3a is 13. Compare this head numeral\r\nwith A8, plate 12, _B_, which also denotes 13, and also with figure 52,\r\n_x-b'_. The essential elements (see p. 101) {184} are the large pendulous\r\nnose surmounted by a curl, the bulging eye, and the mouth fang, the last\r\nmentioned not appearing in this case. Since the kin coefficient in B3a is\r\nsomewhat effaced, let us call it 0 for the present[155] and proceed to\r\nreduce our number 9.8.9.13.0 to units of the first order by means of Table\r\nXIII:\r\n\r\n  B1 =  9 × 144,000 = 1,296,000\r\n  A2 =  8 ×   7,200 =    57,600\r\n  B2 =  9 ×     360 =     3,240\r\n  A3 = 13 ×      20 =       260\r\n  B3 =  0 ×       1 =         0\r\n                      ---------\r\n                      1,357,100\r\n\r\nDeducting from this number all the Calendar Rounds possible, 71 (see Table\r\nXVI), and applying rules 1, 2, and 3 (pp. 139, 140, and 141, respectively)\r\nto the remainder, we reach as the terminal date 8 Ahau 13 Pop. Now let us\r\nexamine the text and see what is the terminal date actually recorded. In\r\nA4b the student will have little difficulty in recognizing the profile\r\nvariant of the day sign Ahau (see fig. 16, _h', i'_). This at once gives us\r\nthe missing value for the kin coefficient in B3, for the day Ahau can never\r\nbe reached in an Initial Series if the kin coefficient is other than 0.\r\nSimilarly, the day Imix can never be reached in Initial Series if the kin\r\ncoefficient is other than 1, etc. Every one of the 20 possible kin\r\ncoefficients, 0 to 19, has a corresponding day to which it will always\r\nlead, that is, Ahau to Cauac, respectively (see Table I). Thus, if the kin\r\ncoefficient in an Initial-series number were 5, for example, the day sign\r\nof the resulting terminal date must be Chicchan, since Chicchan is the\r\nfifth name after Ahau in Table I. Thus the day sign in Initial-series\r\nterminal dates may be determined by inspection of the kin coefficient as\r\nwell as by rule 2 (p. 140), though, as the student will see, both are\r\napplications of the same principle, that is, deducting all of the 20s\r\npossible and counting forward only the remainder. Returning to our text, we\r\ncan now say without hesitation that our number is 9.8.9.13.0 and that the\r\nday sign in A4b is Ahau. The day coefficient in A4a is just like the katun\r\ncoefficient in A2a, having the same determining characteristic, namely, the\r\nforehead ornament composed of one part. A comparison of this ornament with\r\nthe ornament on the head for 8 in A2a will show that the two forms are\r\nidentical. The bifurcate ornament surmounting the head in A4a is a part of\r\nthe headdress, and as such should not be confused with the forehead\r\nornament. The failure to recognize this point might cause the student to\r\nidentify {185} A4a as the head for 1, that is, having a forehead ornament\r\ncomposed of more than one part, instead of the head for 8. The month glyph,\r\nwhich follows in B4b, is unfortunately effaced, though its coefficient in\r\nB4a is clearly the head for 13. Compare B4a with the uinal coefficient in\r\nA3a and with the heads for 13 in figure 52, _x-b'_. As recorded, therefore,\r\nthe terminal date reads 8 Ahau 13 ?, thus agreeing in every particular so\r\nfar as it goes with the terminal date reached by calculation, 8 Ahau 13\r\nPop. In all probability the effaced sign in B4b originally was the month\r\nPop. The whole Initial Series therefore reads 9.8.9.13.0 8 Ahau 13 Pop.\r\n\r\nIn figure 69, _B_, is shown the Initial Series from Stela P at Copan.[156]\r\nThe introducing glyph appears in A1-B2 and is followed by the\r\nInitial-series number in A3-B4. The student will readily identify A3, B3,\r\nand A4 as 9 cycles, 9 katuns, and 10 tuns, respectively. Note the beard on\r\nthe head representing the number 9 in both A3a and B3a. As explained on\r\npage 100, this characteristic of the head for 9 is not always present (see\r\nfig. 52, _g-i_). The uinal and kin glyphs have been crowded together into\r\none glyph-block, B4, the uinal appearing in B4a and the kin in B4b. Both\r\ntheir coefficients are 0, which is expressed in each case by the form shown\r\nin figure 47. The whole number recorded is 9.9.10.0.0; reducing this to\r\nunits of the first order by means of Table XIII, we obtain:\r\n\r\n  A3  =  9 × 144,000 = 1,296,000\r\n  B3  =  9 ×   7,200 =    64,800\r\n  A4  = 10 ×     360 =     3,600\r\n  B4a =  0 ×      20 =         0\r\n  B4b =  0 ×       1 =         0\r\n                       ---------\r\n                       1,364,400\r\n\r\nDeducting from this number all of the Calendar Rounds possible, 71 (see\r\nTable XVI), and applying rules 1, 2, and 3 (pp. 139, 140, and 141,\r\nrespectively) to the remainder, the terminal date reached will be 2 Ahau 13\r\nPop. In A5a the day 2 Ahau is very clearly recorded, the day sign being\r\nexpressed by the profile variant and the 2 by two dots (incorrectly shown\r\nas one dot in the accompanying drawing).[157] Passing over A5b, B5, and A6\r\nwe reach in B6a the closing glyph of the Supplementary Series, and in the\r\nfollowing glyph, B6b, the month part of this terminal date. The coefficient\r\nis 13, and comparing the sign itself with the month signs in figure 19, it\r\nwill be seen that the form in _a_ (Pop) is the month recorded here. The\r\nwhole Initial Series therefore reads 9.9.10.0.0 2 Ahau 13 Pop. {186}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 70. Initial Series, showing head-variant numerals and\r\nperiod glyphs, from Zoömorph G at Quirigua.]\r\n\r\nIn figure 70 is illustrated the Initial Series from Zoömorph G at\r\nQuirigua.[158] The introducing glyph appears in A1-B2 and is followed in\r\nC1-H1 by the Initial-series number. Glyphs C1 D1 record 9 cycles. The dots\r\non the head for 9 in C1 are partially effaced. In C2 is the katun\r\ncoefficient and in D2 the katun sign. The determining characteristic of the\r\nhead for 7 appears in C2, namely, the scroll passing under the eye and\r\nprojecting upward and in front of the forehead. See page 100 and figure 51,\r\n_w_. It would seem, then, at first sight that 7 katuns were recorded in C2\r\nD2. That this was not the case, however, a closer examination of C2 will\r\nshow. Although the lower part of this glyph is somewhat weathered, enough\r\nstill remains to show that this head originally had a fleshless lower jaw,\r\na character increasing its value by 10. Consequently, instead of having 7\r\nkatuns in C2 D2 we have 17 (7 + 10) katuns. Compare C2 with figure 53,\r\n_j-m_. In E1 F1, 15 tuns are recorded. The tun headdress in E1 gives the\r\nvalue 5 to the head there depicted (see fig. 51, _n-s_) and the fleshless\r\nlower jaw adds 10, making the value of E1 15. Compare figure 53, _b-e_,\r\nwhere examples of the head for 15 are given. Glyphs E2 and F2 represent 0\r\nuinals and G1 H1 0 kins; note the clasped hand in E2 and G1, which denotes\r\nthe 0 in each case. This whole number therefore reads 9.17.15.0.0. Reducing\r\nthis to units of the first order by means of Table XIII, we have:\r\n\r\n  C1 D1 =  9 × 144,000 = 1,296,000\r\n  C2 D2 = 17 ×   7,200 =   122,400\r\n  E1 F1 = 15 ×     360 =     5,400\r\n  E2 F2 =  0 ×      20 =         0\r\n  G1 H1 =  0 ×       1 =         0\r\n                         ---------\r\n                         1,423,800\r\n\r\nDeducting from this number all the Calendar Rounds possible, 75 (see Table\r\nXVI), and applying rules 1, 2, and 3 (pp. 139, 140, and 141, respectively),\r\nto the remainder, the terminal day reached will be 5 Ahau 3 Muan. The day\r\nis recorded in G2 H2. The day sign in H2 is quite clearly the grotesque\r\nhead variant for Ahau in figure 16, _j'-k'_. The presence of the tun\r\nheaddress in G2 indicates that the coefficient here recorded must have been\r\neither 5 or 15, depending on whether or not the lower part of the head\r\noriginally had a fleshless lower jaw or not. In this particular case there\r\nis no room for doubt, since the numeral in G2 is a day coefficient, and day\r\ncoefficients as stated in Chapter III, can never rise above 13.\r\nConsequently the number 15 can not be recorded in G2, and this form must\r\nstand for the number 5.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLDEST INITIAL SERIES AT COPAN--STELA 15]\r\n\r\n{187}\r\n\r\nPassing over I1 J1, I2 J2, K1 Ll, K2 L2, we reach in M1 the closing glyph\r\nof the Supplementary Series, here shown with a coefficient of 10, the head\r\nhaving a fleshless lower jaw. The month sign follows in N1. The coefficient\r\nis 3 and by comparing the sign itself with the month glyphs in figure 19,\r\nit will be apparent that the sign for Muan in _a'_ or _b'_ is recorded\r\nhere. The Initial Series of this monument therefore is 9.17.15.0.0 5 Ahau 3\r\nMuan.\r\n\r\nIn closing the presentation of Initial-series texts which show both\r\nhead-variant numerals and period glyphs, the writer has thought best to\r\nfigure the Initial Series on Stela 15 at Copan, because it is not only the\r\noldest Initial Series at Copan, but also the oldest one known in which\r\nhead-variant numerals are used[159] (see pl. 13). The introducing glyph\r\nappears at A1-B2. There follows in A3 a number too much effaced to read,\r\nbut which, on the basis of all our previous experience, we are justified in\r\ncalling 9. Similarly B3 must be the head variant of the cycle sign. The\r\nnumeral 4 is clearly recorded in A4. Note the square irid, protruding fang,\r\nand mouth curl. Compare A4 with figure 51, _j-m_. Although the glyph in B4\r\nis too much effaced to read, we are justified in assuming that it is the\r\nhead variant of the katun sign. The glyph in A5 is the numeral 10. Note the\r\nfleshless lower jaw and other characteristics of the death's-head. Again we\r\nare justified in assuming that B5 must be the head variant of the tun sign.\r\nThe glyphs A6, B6 clearly record 0 uinals. Note the clasped hand denoting\r\nzero in A6, and the curling mouth fang of the uinal period glyph in B6.\r\nThis latter glyph is the full-figure form of the uinal sign[160] (a frog).\r\nCompare B6 with figure 33, which shows the uinal sign on Stela D at Copan.\r\nThe stela is broken off just below the uinal sign and its coefficient; and\r\ntherefore the kin coefficient and sign, the day coefficient and sign, and\r\nthe month coefficient and sign, are missing. Assembling the four periods\r\npresent, we have 9.4.10.0.?. Calling the missing kin coefficient 0, and\r\nreducing this number to units of the first order by means of Table XIII, we\r\nhave:\r\n\r\n  A3 B3 =  9 × 144,000 = 1,296,000\r\n  A4 B4 =  4 ×   7,200 =    28,800\r\n  A5 B5 = 10 ×     360 =     3,600\r\n  A6 B6 =  0 ×      20 =         0\r\n           0 ×       1 =         0\r\n                         ---------\r\n                         1,328,400\r\n\r\nDeducting from this number all the Calendar Rounds possible, 69 {188} (see\r\nTable XVI), and applying rules 1, 2, and 3 (pp. 139, 140, and 141,\r\nrespectively) to the remainder, the terminal date reached will be 12 Ahau 8\r\nMol. This date is reached on the assumption that the missing kin\r\ncoefficient was zero. This is a fairly safe assumption, since when the tun\r\ncoefficient is either 0, 5, 10, or 15 (as here) and the uinal coefficient\r\nis 0 (as here), the kin coefficient is almost invariably zero. That is, the\r\nclose of an even hotun in the Long Count is recorded.\r\n\r\nWhile at Copan in May, 1912, the writer was shown a fragment of a stela\r\nwhich he was told was a part of this monument (Stela 15). This showed the\r\ntop parts of two consecutive glyphs, the first of which very clearly had a\r\ncoefficient of 12 and the one following of 8. The glyphs to which these\r\ncoefficients belonged were missing, but the coincidence of the two numbers\r\n12 (?) 8 (?) was so striking when taken into consideration with the fact\r\nthat these were the day and month coefficients reached by calculation, that\r\nthe writer was inclined to accept this fragment as the missing part of\r\nStela 15 which showed the terminal date. This whole Initial Series\r\ntherefore reads: 9.4.10.0.0 12 Ahau 8 Mol. It is chiefly interesting\r\nbecause it shows the earliest use of head-variant numerals known.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing texts plate 12, _A_, _B_, figure 69, _A_, _B_, and figure\r\n70, the head-variant numerals 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 17,\r\nand 18 have been given, and, excepting the forms for 2, 11, and 12, these\r\ninclude examples of all the head numerals.[161] No more texts specially\r\nillustrating this type of numeral will be presented, but when any of the\r\nhead numerals not figured above (2, 7, 11, 12, 16, and 19) occur in future\r\ntexts their presence will be noted.\r\n\r\nBefore taking up the consideration of unusual or irregular Initial Series\r\nthe writer has thought best to figure one Initial Series the period glyphs\r\nand numerals of which are expressed by full-figure forms. As mentioned on\r\npage 68, such inscriptions are exceedingly rare, and such glyphs, moreover,\r\nare essentially the same as head-variant forms, since their determining\r\ncharacteristics are restricted to their head parts, which are exactly like\r\nthe corresponding head-variant forms. This fact will greatly aid the\r\nstudent in identifying the full-figure glyphs in the following text.\r\n\r\nIn plate 14 is figured the Initial Series from Stela D at Copan.[162] The\r\nintroducing glyph is recorded in A1. The variable central element in\r\nkeeping with the other glyphs of the inscription appears here as a full\r\nfigure, the lower part of which is concealed by the tun-sign.[163]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INITIAL SERIES ON STELA D, COPAN, SHOWING\r\nFULL-FIGURE NUMERAL GLYPHS AND PERIOD GLYPHS]\r\n\r\n{189}\r\n\r\nThe Initial-series number itself appears in B1-B3. The cycle sign is a\r\ngrotesque bird, designated by Mr. Bowditch a parrot, an identification\r\nwhich the hooked beak and claws strongly suggest. The essential element of\r\nthe cycle sign, however, the clasped hand, appears only in the head of this\r\nbird, where the student will readily find it. Indeed, the head of this\r\nfull-figure form is nothing more nor less than a head-variant cycle glyph,\r\nand as such determines the meaning of the whole figure. Compare this head\r\nwith figure 25, _d-f_, or with any of the other head-variant cycle forms\r\nfigured in the preceding texts. This grotesque \"cycle bird,\" perhaps the\r\nparrot, is bound to the back of an anthropomorphic figure, which we have\r\nevery reason to suppose records the cycle coefficient. An examination of\r\nthis figure will show that it has not only the dots on the lower part of\r\nthe cheek, but also the beard, both of which are distinctive features of\r\nthe head for 9. Compare this head with figure 52, _g-l_, or with any other\r\nhead variants for the numeral 9 already figured. Bearing in mind that the\r\nheads only present the determining characteristics of full-figure glyphs,\r\nthe student will easily identify B1 as recording 9 cycles.\r\n\r\nThe katun and its coefficient are represented in A2, the former by a\r\ngrotesque bird, an eagle according to Mr. Bowditch, and the latter by\r\nanother anthropomorphic figure. The period glyph shows no essential element\r\nrecognizable as such, and its identification as the katun sign therefore\r\nrests on its position, immediately following the cycle sign. The head of\r\nthe full figure, which represents the katun coefficient, shows the\r\nessential element of the head for 5, the tun headdress. It has also the\r\nfleshless lower jaw of the head for 10. The combination of these two\r\nelements in one head, as we have seen, indicates the numeral 15, and A2\r\ntherefore records 15 katuns. Compare the head of this anthropomorphic\r\nfigure with figure 53, _b-e_.\r\n\r\nThe tun and its coefficient are represented in B2. The former again appears\r\nas a grotesque bird, though in this case of undetermined nature. Its head,\r\nhowever, very clearly shows the essential element of the head-variant tun\r\nsign, the fleshless lower jaw. Compare this form with figure 29, _e-g_, and\r\nthe other head-variant tun signs already illustrated. The head of the\r\nanthropomorphic figure, which denotes the tun coefficient, is just like the\r\nhead of the anthropomorphic figure in the preceding glyph (A2), except that\r\nin B2 the head has no fleshless lower jaw.\r\n\r\nSince the head in A2 with the fleshless lower jaw and the tun headdress\r\nrepresents the numeral 15, the head in B2 without the former but with the\r\nlatter represents the numeral 5. Compare the head of the anthropomorphic\r\nfigure in B2 with figure 51, _n-s_. It is clear, therefore, that 5 tuns are\r\nrecorded in B2.\r\n\r\nThe uinal and its coefficient in A3 are equally clear. The period glyph\r\nhere appears as a frog (Maya, _uo_), which, as we have seen {190}\r\nelsewhere, may have been chosen to represent the 20-day period because of\r\nthe similarity of its name, _uo_, to the name of this period, _u_, or\r\nuinal. The head of the anthropomorphic figure which clasps the frog's\r\nforeleg is the head variant for 0. Note the clasped hand across the lower\r\npart of the face, and compare this form with figure 53, _s-w_. The whole\r\nglyph, therefore, stands for 0 uinals.\r\n\r\nIn B3 are recorded the kin and its coefficient. The period glyph here is\r\nrepresented by an anthropomorphic figure with a grotesque head. Its\r\nidentity, as representing the kins of this number, is better established\r\nfrom its position in the number than from its appearance, which is somewhat\r\nirregular. The kin coefficient is just like the uinal coefficient--an\r\nanthropomorphic figure the head of which has the clasped hand as its\r\ndetermining characteristic. Therefore B3 records 0 kins.\r\n\r\nThe whole number expressed by B1-B3 is 9.15.5.0.0; reducing this by means\r\nof Table XIII to units of the first order, we have:\r\n\r\n  B1 =  9 × 144,000 = 1,296,000\r\n  A2 = 15 ×   7,200 =   108,000\r\n  B2 =  5 ×     360 =     1,800\r\n  A3 =  0 ×      20 =         0\r\n  B3 =  0 ×       1 =         0\r\n                      ---------\r\n                      1,405,800\r\n\r\nDeducting from this number all the Calendar Rounds possible, 74 (see Table\r\nXVI), and applying rules 1, 2, and 3 (pp. 139, 140, and 141 respectively),\r\nto the remainder, the terminal date reached will be 10 Ahau 8 Chen.\r\n\r\nThe day part of this terminal date is recorded in A4. The day sign Ahau is\r\nrepresented as an anthropomorphic figure, crouching within the customary\r\nday-sign cartouche. The head of this figure is the familiar profile variant\r\nfor the day sign Ahau, seen in figure 16, _h', i'_. This cartouche is\r\nclasped by the left arm of another anthropomorphic figure, the day\r\ncoefficient, the head of which is the skull, denoting the numeral 10. Note\r\nthe fleshless lower jaw of this head and compare it with the same element\r\nin figure 52, _m-r_. This glyph A4 records, therefore, the day reached by\r\nthe Initial Series, 10 Ahau.\r\n\r\nThe position of the month glyph in this text is most unusual. Passing over\r\nB4, the first glyph of the Supplementary Series, the month glyph follows it\r\nimmediately in A5. The month coefficient appears again as an\r\nanthropomorphic figure, the head of which has for its determining\r\ncharacteristic the forehead ornament composed of one part, denoting the\r\nnumeral 8. Compare this head with the heads for 8, in figure 52, _a-f_. The\r\nmonth sign itself appears as a large grotesque head, the details of which\r\npresent the essential elements of the month here recorded--Chen. Compare\r\nwith figure 19, _o, p_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INITIAL SERIES ON STELA J, COPAN]\r\n\r\n{191}\r\n\r\nThe superfix of figure 16, _o, p_, has been retained unchanged as the\r\nsuperfix in A5b. The element () appears just above the eye of the grotesque\r\nhead, and the element (**) on the left-hand side about where the ear lobe\r\nshould be. The whole glyph unmistakably records a head variant of the month\r\nglyph Chen, and this Initial Series therefore reads 9.15.5.0.0 10 Ahau 8\r\nChen.\r\n\r\nThe student will note that this Initial Series records a date just 5 tuns\r\nlater than the Initial Series on Stela B at Copan (pl. 7, _A_). According\r\nto the writer's opinion, therefore, Stelæ B and D marked two successive\r\nhotuns at this city.\r\n\r\nWe come now to the consideration of Initial Series which are either unusual\r\nor irregular in some respect, examples of which it is necessary to give in\r\norder to familiarize the student with all kinds of texts.\r\n\r\nThe Initial Series in plate 15, _A_,[164] is figured because of the very\r\nunusual order followed by its glyphs. The sequence in which these succeed\r\neach other is given in _B_ of that plate. The scheme followed seems to have\r\nbeen that of a mat pattern. The introducing glyph appears in position 0\r\n(pl. 15, _B_), and the student will readily recognize it in the same\r\nposition in _A_ of the same plate. The Initial Series number follows in 1,\r\n2, 3, 4, and 5 (pl. 15, _B_). Referring to these corresponding positions in\r\n_A_, we find that 9 cycles are recorded in 1, and 13 katuns in 2. At this\r\npoint the diagonal glyph- band passes under another band, emerging at 3,\r\nwhere the tun sign with a coefficient of 10 is recorded. Here the band\r\nturns again and, crossing backward diagonally, shows 0 uinals in 4. At this\r\npoint the band passes under three diagonals running in the opposite\r\ndirection, emerging at position 5, the glyph in which are recorded 0 kins.\r\n\r\nThis number 9.13.10.0.0 reduces by means of Table XIII to units of the\r\nfirst order, as follows:\r\n\r\n  1 =  9 × 144,000 = 1,296,000\r\n  2 = 13 ×   7,200 =    93,600\r\n  3 = 10 ×     360 =     3,600\r\n  4 =  0 ×      20 =         0\r\n  5 =  0 ×       1 =         0\r\n                     ---------\r\n                     1,393,200\r\n\r\nDeducting from this number all the Calendar Rounds possible, 73 (see Table\r\nXVI), and applying rules 1, 2, and 3 (pp. 139, 140, and 141, respectively)\r\nto the remainder, the terminal date reached will be 7 Ahau 3 Cumhu.\r\nReferring again to plate 15, _B_, for the sequence of the glyphs in this\r\ntext, it is clear that the day of this terminal date should be recorded in\r\n6, immediately after the kins of the Initial-series number in 6. It will be\r\nseen, however, in plate 15, _A_, that {192} glyph 6 is effaced, and\r\nconsequently the day is missing. Passing over 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11, in _A_\r\nand _B_ of the plate named, we reach in the lower half of 12 the closing\r\nglyph of the Supplementary Series here shown with a coefficient of 10.\r\nCompare this form with figure 65. The month glyph, therefore, should follow\r\nin the upper half of 13.[165] This glyph is very clearly the form for the\r\nmonth Cumhu (see fig. 19, _g', h'_), and it seems to have attached to it\r\nthe bar and dot coefficient 8. A comparison of this with the month\r\ncoefficient 3, determined above by calculation, shows that the two do not\r\nagree, and that the month coefficient as recorded exceeds the month\r\ncoefficient determined by calculation, by 5, or in Maya notation, 1 bar.\r\nSince the Initial-series number is very clearly 9.13.10.0.0, and since this\r\nnumber leads to the terminal date 7 Ahau 3 Cumhu, it would seem that the\r\nancient scribes had made an error in this text, recording 1 bar and 3 dots\r\ninstead of 3 dots alone. The writer is inclined to believe, however, that\r\nthe bar here is only ornamental and has no numerical value whatsoever,\r\nhaving been inserted solely to balance this glyph. If it had been omitted,\r\nthe month sign would have had to be greatly elongated and its proportions\r\ndistorted in order to fill completely the space available. According to the\r\nwriter's interpretation, this Initial Series reads 9.13.10.0.0 7 Ahau 3\r\nCumhu.\r\n\r\nThe opposite face of the above-mentioned monument presents the same\r\ninterlacing scheme, though in this case the glyph bands cross at right\r\nangles to each other instead of diagonally.\r\n\r\nThe only other inscription in the whole Maya territory, so far as the\r\nwriter knows, which at all parallels the curious interlacing pattern of the\r\nglyphs on the back of Stela J at Copan, just described, is Stela H at\r\nQuirigua, illustrated in figure 71.[166] The drawing of this inscription\r\nappears in a of this figure and the key to the sequence of the glyphs in b.\r\nThe introducing glyph occupies position 1 and is followed by the Initial\r\nSeries in 2-6. The student will have little difficulty in identifying 2, 3,\r\nand 4 as 9 cycles, 16 katuns, and 0 tuns, respectively. The uinal and kin\r\nglyphs in 5 and 6, respectively, are so far effaced that in order to\r\ndetermine the values of their coefficients we shall have to rely to a large\r\nextent on other inscriptions here at Quirigua. For example, every monument\r\nat Quirigua which presents an Initial Series marks the close of some\r\nparticular hotun in the Long Count; consequently, all the Initial Series at\r\nQuirigua which record these Katun endings have 0 for their uinal and kin\r\ncoefficients.[167] This {193} absolute uniformity in regard to the uinal\r\nand kin coefficients in all the other Initial Series at Quirigua justifies\r\nthe assumption that in the text here under discussion 0 uinals and 0 kins\r\nwere originally recorded in glyphs 5 and 6, respectively. Furthermore, an\r\ninspection of the coefficients of these two glyphs in figure 71, _a_, shows\r\nthat both of them are of the same general size and shape as the tun\r\ncoefficient in 4, which, as we have seen, is very clearly 0. It is more\r\nthan probable that the uinal and kin coefficients in this text were\r\noriginally 0, like the tun coefficient, and that through weathering they\r\nhave been eroded down to their present shape. In figure 72, _a_, is shown\r\nthe tun coefficient and beside it in _b_, the uinal or kin coefficient. The\r\ndotted parts in _b_ are the lines which have disappeared through erosion,\r\nif this coefficient was originally 0. It seems more than likely from the\r\nforegoing that the uinal and kin coefficients in this number were\r\noriginally 0, and proceeding on this assumption, we have recorded in glyphs\r\n2-6, figure 71, _a_, the number 9.16.0.0.0.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 71. Initial Series on Stela H, Quirigua: _a_, Mat\r\npattern of glyph sequence; _b_, key to sequence of glyphs in a.]\r\n\r\nReducing this to units of the first order by means of Table XIII, we have:\r\n\r\n  5 =  9 × 144,000 = 1,296,000\r\n  6 = 16 ×   7,200 =   115,200\r\n  7 =  0 ×     360 =         0\r\n  8 =  0 ×      20 =         0\r\n  9 =  0 ×       1 =         0\r\n                     ---------\r\n                     1,411,200\r\n\r\nDeducting from this number all the Calendar Rounds possible, 74 (see Table\r\nXVI), and applying rules 1, 2, and 3 (pp. 139, 140, and 141, respectively)\r\nto the remainder, the terminal date 2 Ahau 13 Tzec will be reached.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 72. The tun, uinal, and kin coefficients on Stela H,\r\nQuirigua: _a_, Tun coefficient; _b_, suggested restoration of the uinal and\r\nkin coefficients like the tun coefficient.]\r\n\r\nIn spite of some weathering, the day part of the terminal date appears in\r\nglyph 7 immediately after the kin glyph in 6. The coefficient, though\r\nsomewhat eroded, appears quite clearly as 2 (2 dots separated by an\r\nornamental crescent). The day sign itself is the profile variant for Ahau\r\nshown in figure 16, _h', i'_. The agreement of {194} the day recorded with\r\nthe day determined by calculations based on the assumption that the kin and\r\nuinal coefficients are both 0, of itself tends to establish the accuracy of\r\nthese assumptions. Passing over 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14, we reach in\r\n15 the closing glyph of the Supplementary Series, and in 16 probably, the\r\nmonth glyph. This form, although badly eroded, presents no features either\r\nin the outline of its coefficient or in the sign itself which would prevent\r\nit representing the month part 13 Tzec. The coefficient is just wide enough\r\nfor three vertical divisions (2 bars and 3 dots), and the month glyph\r\nitself is divided into two parts, a superfix comprising about one-third of\r\nthe glyph and the main element the remaining two-thirds. Compare this form\r\nwith the sign for Tzec in figure 19, _g, h_. Although this text is too much\r\nweathered to permit absolute certainty with reference to the reading of\r\nthis Initial Series, the writer nevertheless believes that in all\r\nprobability it records the date given above, namely, 9.16.0.0.0 2 Ahau 13\r\nTzec. If this is so, Stela H is the earliest hotun-marker at Quirigua.[168]\r\n\r\nThe student will have noticed from the foregoing texts, and it has also\r\nbeen stated several times, that the cycle coefficient is almost invariably\r\n9. Indeed, the only two exceptions to this rule in the inscriptions already\r\nfigured are the Initial Series from the Temples of the Foliated Cross and\r\nthe Sun at Palenque (pl. 12, _A_ and _B_, respectively), in which the cycle\r\ncoefficient in each case was 1. As explained on page 179, footnote 1, these\r\ntwo Initial Series refer probably to mythological events, and the dates\r\nwhich they record were not contemporaneous with the erection of the temples\r\non whose walls they are inscribed; and, finally, Cycle 9 was the first\r\nhistoric period of the Maya civilization, the epoch which witnessed the\r\nrise and fall of all the southern cities.\r\n\r\nAs explained on page 179, footnote 2, however, there are one or two Initial\r\nSeries which can hardly be considered as referring to mythological events,\r\neven though the dates which they record fall in a cycle earlier than Cycle\r\n9. It was stated, further, in the same place that these two Initial Series\r\nwere not found inscribed on large monuments but on smaller antiquities, one\r\nof them being a small nephrite figure which has been designated the Tuxtla\r\nStatuette, and the other a nephrite plate, designated the Leyden Plate;\r\nand, finally, that the dates recorded on these two antiquities probably\r\ndesignated contemporaneous events in the historic period of the Maya\r\ncivilization. {195}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 73. The Initial Series on the Tuxtla Statuette, the\r\noldest Initial Series known (in the early part of Cycle 8).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 74. The introducing glyph (?) of the Initial Series on\r\nthe Tuxtla Statuette.]\r\n\r\nThese two minor antiquities have several points in common. Both are made of\r\nthe same material (nephrite) and both have their glyphs incised instead of\r\ncarved. More important, however, than these similarities is the fact that\r\nthe Initial Series recorded on each of them has for its cycle coefficient\r\nthe numeral 8; in other words, both record dates which fell in the cycle\r\nimmediately preceding that of the historic period, or Cycle 9. Finally, at\r\nleast one of these two Initial Series (that on the Leyden Plate), if indeed\r\nnot both, records a date so near the opening of the historic period, which\r\nwe may assume occurred about 9.0.0.0.0 8 Ahau 13 Ceh in round numbers, that\r\nit may be considered as belonging to the historic period, and hence\r\nconstitutes the earliest historical inscription from the Maya territory.\r\n{196}\r\n\r\nThe Initial Series on the first of these minor antiquities, the Tuxtla\r\nStatuette, is shown in figure 73.[169] The student will note at the outset\r\none very important difference between this Initial Series--if indeed it is\r\none, which some have doubted--and those already presented. No period glyphs\r\nappear in the present example, and consequently the Initial-series number\r\nis expressed by the second method (p. 129), that is, numeration by\r\nposition, as in the codices. See the discussion of Initial Series in the\r\ncodices in Chapter VI (pp. 266-273), and plates 31 and 32. This at once\r\ndistinguishes the Initial Series on the Tuxtla Statuette from every other\r\nInitial Series in the inscriptions now known. The number is preceded by a\r\ncharacter which bears some general resemblance to the usual Initial-series\r\nintroducing glyph. See figure 74. The most striking point of similarity is\r\nthe trinal superfix, which is present in both signs. The student will have\r\nlittle difficulty in reading the number here recorded as 8 cycles, 6\r\nkatuns, 2 tuns, 4 uinals, and 17 kins, that is, 8.6.2.4.17; reducing this\r\nto units of the first order by means of Table XIII, we have:\r\n\r\n   8 × 144,000 = 1,152,000\r\n   6 ×   7,200 =    43,200\r\n   2 ×     360 =       720\r\n   4 ×      20 =        80\r\n  17 ×       1 =        17\r\n                 ---------\r\n                 1,196,017\r\n\r\nSolving this Initial-series number for its terminal date, it will be found\r\nto be 8 Caban 0 Kankin. Returning once more to our text (see fig. 73), we\r\nfind the day coefficient above reached, 8, is recorded just below the 17\r\nkins and appears to be attached to some character the details of which are,\r\nunfortunately, effaced. The month coefficient 0 and the month sign Kankin\r\ndo not appear in the accompanying text, at least in recognizable form. This\r\nInitial Series would seem to be, therefore, 8.6.2.4.17 8 Caban 0 Kankin, of\r\nwhich the day sign, month coefficient, and month sign are effaced or\r\nunrecognizable. In spite of its unusual form and the absence of the day\r\nsign, and the month coefficient and sign the writer is inclined to accept\r\nthe above date as a contemporaneous Initial Series.[170]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 75. Drawings of the Initial Series: _A_, On the Leyden\r\nPlate. This records a Cycle-8 date and next to the Tuxtla Statuette Initial\r\nSeries, is the earliest known. _B_, On a lintel from the Temple of the\r\nInitial Series, Chichen Itza. This records a Cycle-10 date, and is one of\r\nthe latest Initial Series known.]\r\n\r\nThe other Initial Series showing a cycle coefficient 8 is on the Leyden\r\nPlate, a drawing of which is reproduced in figure 75, _A._ This Initial\r\nSeries is far more satisfactory than the one just described, and {197} its\r\nauthenticity, generally speaking, is unquestioned. The student will easily\r\nidentify A1-B2 as an Initial-series introducing glyph, even though the pair\r\nof comblike appendages flanking the central element and the tun tripod are\r\nboth wanting. Compare this form with figure 24. The Initial-series number,\r\nexpressed by normal-form numerals and head-variant period glyphs, follows\r\nin A3-A7. The former are all very clear, and the number may be read from\r\nthem in spite of certain irregularities in the corresponding period glyphs.\r\nFor example, the katun head in A4 has the clasped hand, which is the\r\ndistinguishing characteristic of the cycle head, and as such should have\r\nappeared in the head in A3. Neither the tun head in A5 nor the kin head in\r\nA7 shows an essential element heretofore found distinguishing these\r\nparticular period glyphs. Indeed, the only period glyph of the five showing\r\nthe usual essential element is the uinal head in A6, where the large mouth\r\ncurl appears very clearly. However, the number recorded here may be read as\r\n8.14.3.1.12 from the sequence of the coefficients--that is, their position\r\nwith reference to the introducing glyph--a reading, moreover, which is\r\nconfirmed by the only known period glyph, the uinal sign, standing in the\r\nfourth position after the introducing glyph. {198}\r\n\r\nReducing this number to units of the first order by means of Table XIII, we\r\nhave:\r\n\r\n  A3 =  8 ×  144,000 = 1,152,000\r\n  A4 = 14 ×    7,200 =   100,800\r\n  A5 =  3 ×      360 =     1,080\r\n  A6 =  1 ×       20 =        20\r\n  A7 = 12 ×        1 =        12\r\n                       ---------\r\n                       1,253,912\r\n\r\nDeducting from this number all the Calendar Rounds possible, 66 (see Table\r\nXVI), and applying rules 1, 2, and 3 (pp. 139, 140, and 141, respectively)\r\nto the remainder, the terminal date reached will be 1 Eb 0 Yaxkin. The day\r\npart of this date is very clearly recorded in A8, the coefficient 1 being\r\nexpressed by one dot, and the day sign itself having the hook surrounded by\r\ndots, and the prominent teeth, both of which are characteristic of the\r\ngrotesque head which denotes the day Eb. See figure 16, _s-u_.\r\n\r\nThe month glyph appears in A9a, the lower half of which unmistakably\r\nrecords the month Yaxkin. (See fig. 19, _k, l_.) Note the _yax_ and _kin_\r\nelements in each. The only difficulty here seems to be the fact that a bar\r\n(5) is attached to this glyph. The writer believes, however, that the\r\nunexplained element () is the month coefficient in this text, and that it\r\nis an archaic form for 0. He would explain the bar as being merely\r\nornamental. The whole Initial Series reads: 8.14.3.1.12 1 Eb 0 Yaxkin.\r\n\r\nThe fact that there are some few irregularities in this text confirms\r\nrather than invalidates the antiquity which has been ascribed to it by the\r\nwriter. Dating from the period when the Maya were just emerging from\r\nsavagery to the arts and practices of a semicivilized state, it is not at\r\nall surprising that this inscription should reflect the crudities and\r\nuncertainties of its time. Indeed, it is quite possible that at the very\r\nearly period from which it probably dates (8.14.3.1.12 1 Eb 0 Yaxkin) the\r\nperiod glyphs had not yet become sufficiently conventionalized to show\r\nindividual peculiarities, and their identity may have been determined\r\nsolely by their position with reference to the introducing glyph, as\r\nseemingly is the case in some of the period glyphs of this text.\r\n\r\nThe Initial Series on the Leyden Plate precedes the Initial Series on Stela\r\n3 at Tikal, the earliest contemporaneous date from the monuments, by more\r\nthan 160 years, and with the possible exception of the Tuxtla Statuette\r\nabove described, probably records the earliest date of Maya history. It\r\nshould be noted here that Cycle-8 Initial Series are occasionally found in\r\nthe Dresden Codex, though none are quite so early as the Initial Series\r\nfrom the Tuxtla Statuette. {199}\r\n\r\nPassing over the Initial Series whose cycle coefficient is 9, many of which\r\nhave already been described, we come next to the consideration of Initial\r\nSeries whose cycle coefficient is 10, a very limited number indeed. As\r\nexplained in Chapter I, the southern cities did not long survive the\r\nopening of Cycle 10, and since Initial-series dating did not prevail\r\nextensively in the later cities of the north, Initial Series showing 10\r\ncycles are very unusual.\r\n\r\nIn figure 75, _B_, is shown the Initial Series from the Temple of the\r\nInitial Series at Chichen Itza, the great metropolis of northern Yucatan.\r\nThis inscription is not found on a stela but on the under side of a lintel\r\nover a doorway leading into a small and comparatively insignificant temple.\r\nThe introducing glyph appears in A1-B2 and is followed by the\r\nInitial-series number in A3-A5. The student will have little difficulty in\r\ndeciphering all of the coefficients except that belonging to the kin in A5,\r\nwhich is a head-variant numeral, and the whole number will be found to read\r\n10.2.9.1.?. The coefficient of the day of the terminal date is very clearly\r\n9 (see B5) and the month part, 7 Zac (see A6). We may now read this Initial\r\nSeries as 10.2.9.1.? 9? 7 Zac; in other words, the kin coefficient and the\r\nday sign are still indeterminate. First substituting 0 as the missing value\r\nof the kin coefficient, the terminal date reached will be 10.2.9.1.0 13\r\nAhau 18 Yax. But according to Table XV, position 18 Yax is just 9 days\r\nearlier than position 7 Zac, the month part recorded in A6. Consequently,\r\nin order to reach 7 Zac from 10.2.9.1.0 13 Ahau 18 Yax, 9 more days are\r\nnecessary. Counting these forward from 10.2.9.1.0 13 Ahau 18 Yax, the date\r\nreached will be 10.2.9.1.9 9 Muluc 7 Zac, which is the date recorded on\r\nthis lintel. Compare the day sign with figure 16, _m, n_, and the month\r\nsign with figure 19, _s, t_. {200}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 76. The Cycle-10 Initial Series from Quen Santo (from\r\ndrawings): _A_, Stela 1; _B_, Stela 2. There is less than a year's\r\ndifference in time between the Chichen Itza Initial Series and the Initial\r\nSeries in _B_.]\r\n\r\nTwo other Initial Series whose cycle coefficient is 10 yet remain to be\r\nconsidered, namely, Stelæ 1 and 2 at Quen Santo.[171] The first of these is\r\nshown in figure 76, A, but unfortunately only a fragment of this monument\r\nhas been recovered. In A1-B2 appears a perfectly regular form of the\r\nintroducing glyph (see fig. 24), and this is followed in A3-B4 by the\r\nInitial-series number itself, with the exception of the kin, the glyph\r\nrepresenting which has been broken off. The student will readily identify\r\nA3 as 10 cycles, noting the clasped hand on the head-variant period glyph,\r\nand B3 as 2 katuns. The glyph in A4 has very clearly the coefficient 5, and\r\neven though it does not seem to have the fleshless lower jaw of the tun\r\nhead, from its position alone--after the unmistakable katun sign in B3 we\r\nare perfectly justified in assuming that 5 tuns are recorded here. Both the\r\ncoefficient and the glyph in B4 are unfamiliar. However, as the former must\r\nbe one of the numerals 0 to 19, inclusive, since it is not one of the\r\nnumerals 1 to 19, inclusive, it is clear that it must be a new form for 0.\r\nThe sign to which it is attached bears no resemblance to either the normal\r\nform for the uinal or the head variant; but since it occupies the 4th\r\nposition after the introducing glyph, B4, we are justified in assuming that\r\n0 uinals are recorded here. Beyond this we can not proceed with certainty,\r\nthough the values for the missing parts suggested below are probably those\r\nrecorded on the lost fragments of the monument. As recorded in A3-B4 this\r\nnumber reads 10.2.5.0.?. Now, if we assume that the missing term is filled\r\nwith 0, we shall have recorded the end of an even hotun in the Long Count,\r\nand this monument becomes a regular hotun-marker. That this monument was a\r\nhotun-marker is corroborated by the fact that Stela 2 from Quen Santo very\r\nclearly records the close of the hotun next after 10.2.5.0.0, which the\r\nwriter believes this monument marks. For {201} this reason it seems\r\nprobable that the glyph which stood in A5 recorded 0 kins.\r\n\r\nReducing this number to units of the first order by means of Table XIII, we\r\nobtain:\r\n\r\n  A3      = 10 × 144,000 = 1,440,000\r\n  B3      =  2 ×   7,200 =    14,400\r\n  A4      =  5 ×     360 =     1,800\r\n  B4      =  0 ×      20 =         0\r\n  A5[172] =  0 ×       1 =         0\r\n                           ---------\r\n                           1,456,200\r\n\r\nDeducting from this number all the Calendar Rounds possible, 76 (see Table\r\nXVI), and applying rules 1, 2, and 3 (pp. 139, 140, and 141, respectively)\r\nto the remainder, the terminal date reached will be 9 Ahau 18 Yax, and the\r\nwhole Initial Series originally recorded on this monument was probably\r\n10.2.5.0.0 9 Ahau 18 Yax.\r\n\r\nIn figure 76, _B_, is shown Stela 2 from Quen Santo. The workmanship on\r\nthis monument is somewhat better than on Stela 1 and, moreover, its Initial\r\nSeries is complete. The introducing glyph appears in A1-B2 and is followed\r\nby the Initial-series number in A3-A5. Again, 10 cycles are very clearly\r\nrecorded in A3, the clasped hand of the cycle head still appearing in spite\r\nof the weathering of this glyph. The katun sign in B3 is almost entirely\r\neffaced, though sufficient traces of its coefficient remain to enable us to\r\nidentify it as 2. Note the position of the uneffaced dot with reference to\r\nthe horizontal axis of the glyph. Another dot the same distance above the\r\naxis would come as near the upper left-hand corner of the glyph-block as\r\nthe uneffaced dot does to the lower left-hand corner. Moreover, if 3 had\r\nbeen recorded here the uneffaced dot would have been nearer the bottom. It\r\nis clear that 1 and 4 are quite out of the question and that 2 remains the\r\nonly possible value of the numeral here. We are justified in assuming that\r\nthe effaced period glyph was the katun sign. In A4 10 tuns are very clearly\r\nrecorded; note the fleshless lower jaw of the tun head. The uinal head with\r\nits characteristic mouth curl appears in B4. The coefficient of this latter\r\nglyph is identical with the uinal coefficient in the preceding text (see\r\nfig. 76, _A_) in B4, which we there identified as a form for 0. Therefore\r\nwe must make the same identification here, and B4 then becomes 0 uinals.\r\nFrom its position, if not from its appearance, we are justified in\r\ndesignating the glyph in A5 the head for the kin period; since the\r\ncoefficient attached to this head is the same as the one in the preceding\r\nglyph (B4), we may therefore conclude that 0 kins are recorded here. The\r\nwhole number expressed in A3-A5 is {202} therefore 10.2.10.0.0. Reducing\r\nthis to units of the first order by means of Table XIII, we have:\r\n\r\n  A3 = 10 × 144,000 = 1,440,000\r\n  B3 =  2 ×   7,200 =    14,400\r\n  A4 = 10 ×     360 =     3,600\r\n  B4 =  0 ×      20 =         0\r\n  A5 =  0 ×       1 =         0\r\n                      ---------\r\n                      1,458,000\r\n\r\nDeducting from this number all the Calendar Rounds possible, 76 (see Table\r\nXVI), and applying rules 1, 2, and 3 (pp. 139, 140, and 141, respectively)\r\nto the remainder, the terminal date reached will be 2 Ahau 13 Chen.\r\nAlthough the day sign in B5 is effaced, the coefficient 2 appears quite\r\nclearly. The month glyph is recorded in A6. The student will have little\r\ndifficulty in restoring the coefficient as 13, and the month glyph is\r\ncertainly either Chen, Yax, Zac, or Ceh (compare fig. 19, _o_ and _p_, _q_\r\nand _r_, _s_ and _t_, and _u_ and _v_, respectively). Moreover, since the\r\nmonth coefficient is 13, the day sign in B5 can have been only Chicchan,\r\nOc, Men, or Ahau (see Table VII); since the kin coefficient in A5 is 0, the\r\neffaced day sign must have been Ahau. Therefore the Initial Series on Stela\r\n2 at Quen Santo reads 10.2.10.0.0 2 Ahau 13 Chen and marked the hotun\r\nimmediately following the hotun commemorated by Stela 1 at the same site.\r\n\r\nThe student will note also that the date on Stela 2 at Quen Santo is less\r\nthan a year later than the date recorded by the Initial Series on the\r\nTemple lintel from Chichen Itza (see fig. 75, _B_). And a glance at the map\r\nin plate 1 will show, further, that Chichen Itza and Quen Santo are\r\nseparated from each other by almost the entire length (north and south) of\r\nthe Maya territory, the former being in the extreme northern part of\r\nYucatan and the latter considerably to the south of the central Maya\r\ncities. The presence of two monuments so close together chronologically and\r\nyet so far apart geographically is difficult to explain. Moreover, the\r\nproblem is further complicated by the fact that not one of the many cities\r\nlying between has yielded thus far a date as late as either of these.[173]\r\nThe most logical explanation of this interesting phenomenon seems to be\r\nthat while the main body of the Maya moved northward into Yucatan after the\r\ncollapse of the southern cities others retreated southward into the\r\nhighlands of Guatemala; that while the northern emigrants {203} were\r\ncolonizing Yucatan the southern branch was laying the foundation of the\r\ncivilization which was to flourish later under the name of the Quiche and\r\nother allied peoples; and finally, that as Chichen Itza was a later\r\nnorthern city, so Quen Santo was a later southern site, the two being at\r\none period of their existence at least approximately contemporaneous, as\r\nthese two Initial Series show.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted in this connection that Cycle-10 Initial Series are\r\noccasionally recorded in the Dresden Codex, though the dates in these cases\r\nare all later than those recorded on the Chichen Itza lintel and the Quen\r\nSanto stelæ. Before closing the presentation of Initial-series texts it is\r\nfirst necessary to discuss two very unusual and highly irregular examples\r\nof this method of dating, namely, the Initial Series from the east side of\r\nStela C at Quirigua and the Initial Series from the tablet in the Temple of\r\nthe Cross at Palenque. The dates recorded in these two texts, so far as\r\nknown,[174] are the only ones which are not counted from the starting point\r\nof Maya chronology, the date 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu.\r\n\r\nIn figure 77, _A_, is shown the Initial Series on the east side of Stela C\r\nat Quirigua.[175] The introducing glyph appears in A1-B2, and is followed\r\nby the Initial-series number in A3-A5. The student will easily read this as\r\n13.0.0.0.0. Reducing this number to units of the first order by means of\r\nTable XIII, we have:\r\n\r\n  A3 = 13 × 144,000 = 1,872,000\r\n  B3 =  0 ×   7,200 =         0\r\n  A4 =  0 ×     360 =         0\r\n  B4 =  0 ×      20 =         0\r\n  A5 =  0 ×       1 =         0\r\n                      ---------\r\n                      1,872,000\r\n\r\nDeducting from this number all the Calendar Rounds possible, 98[176] (see\r\nTable XVI), and applying rules 1, 2, and 3 (pp. 139, 140, and 141),\r\nrespectively, to the remainder, the terminal date reached should be, under\r\nordinary circumstances, 4 Ahau 3 Kankin. An inspection of our text,\r\nhowever, will show that the terminal date recorded in B5-A6 is unmistakably\r\n4 Ahau 8 Cumhu, and not 4 Ahau 3 Kankin. The month part in A6 is unusually\r\nclear, and there can be no doubt {204} that it is 8 Cumhu. Compare A6 with\r\nfigure 19, _g', h'_. If we have made no mistake in calculations, then it is\r\nevident that 13.0.0.0.0 counted forward from the starting point of Maya\r\nchronology, 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu, will not reach the terminal date recorded.\r\nFurther, since the count in Initial Series has never been known to be\r\nbackward,[177] we are forced to accept one of two conclusions: Either the\r\nstarting point is not 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu, or there is some error in the\r\noriginal text. However, there is one way by means of which we can ascertain\r\nthe date from which the number 13.0.0.0.0 is counted. The terminal date\r\nreached by the count is recorded very clearly as 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu. Now, if we\r\nreverse our operation and count the given number, 13.0.0.0.0, _backward_\r\nfrom the known terminal date, 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu, we reach the starting point\r\nfrom which the count proceeds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 77. Initial Series which proceed from a date prior to 4\r\nAhau 8 Cumhu, the starting point of Maya chronology: _A_, Stela C (east\r\nside) at Quirigua; _B_, Temple of the Cross at Palenque.]\r\n\r\nDeducting from this number, as before, all the Calendar Rounds possible, 98\r\n(see p. 203, footnote 3), and applying rules 1, 2, and 3 (pp. 139, 140,\r\n141, respectively) to the remainder, remembering that in each operation the\r\ndirection of the count is _backward_, not forward,--the starting point will\r\nbe found to be 4 Ahau 8 Zotz. This is the first Initial Series yet\r\nencountered which has not proceeded from the date 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu, and until\r\nthe new starting point here indicated can be substantiated it will be well\r\nto accept the correctness of this text only with a reservation. The most we\r\ncan say at present is that if the number recorded in A3-A5, 13.0.0.0.0, be\r\ncounted forward from 4 Ahau 8 Zotz as a starting point, the terminal date\r\nreached by calculation will agree with the terminal date as recorded in\r\nB5-A6, 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu. {205}\r\n\r\nLet us next examine the Initial Series on the tablet from the Temple of the\r\nCross at Palenque, which is shown in figure 77, _B_.[178] The introducing\r\nglyph appears in A1-B2, and is followed by the Initial-series number in\r\nA3-B7. The period glyphs in B3, B4, B5, B6, and B7 are all expressed by\r\ntheir corresponding normal forms, which will be readily recognized. Passing\r\nover the cycle coefficient in A3 for the present, it is clear that the\r\nkatun coefficient in A4 is 19. Note the dots around the mouth,\r\ncharacteristic of the head for 9 (fig. 52, _g-l_), and the fleshless lower\r\njaw, the essential element of the head for 10 (fig. 52, _m-r_). The\r\ncombination of the two gives the head in A4 the value of 19. The tun\r\ncoefficient in A5 is equally clear as 13. Note the banded headdress,\r\ncharacteristic of the head for 3 (fig. 51, _h, i_), and the fleshless lower\r\njaw of the 10 head, the combination of the two giving the head for 13 (fig.\r\n52, _w_).[179] The head for 4 and the hand zero sign appear as the\r\ncoefficient of the uinal and kin signs in A6 and A7, respectively. The\r\nnumber will read, therefore, ?.19.13.4.0. Let us examine the cycle\r\ncoefficient in A3 again. The natural assumption, of course, is that it is\r\n9. But the dots characteristic of the head for 9 are not to be found here.\r\nAs this head has no fleshless lower jaw, it can not be 10 or any number\r\nabove 13, and as there is no clasped hand associated with it, it can not\r\nsignify 0, so we are limited to the numbers, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,[180] 6, 7, 8,\r\n11, 12, and 13, as the numeral here recorded. Comparing this form with\r\nthese numerals in figures 51 and 52, it is evident that it can not be 1, 3,\r\n4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 13, and that it must therefore be 2, 11, or 12.\r\nSubstituting these three values in turn, we have 2.19.13.4.0, 11.19.13.4.0,\r\nand 12.19.13.4.0 as the possible numbers recorded in A3-B7, and reducing\r\nthese numbers to units of the first order and deducting the highest number\r\nof Calendar Rounds possible from each, and applying rules 1, 2, and 3 (pp.\r\n139, 140, and 141, respectively) to their remainders, the terminal dates\r\nreached will be:\r\n\r\n   2.19.13.4.0   5 Ahau 3 Pax\r\n  11.19.13.4.0   9 Ahau 8 Yax\r\n  12.19.13.4.0   8 Ahau 13 Pop\r\n\r\nIf this text is perfectly regular and our calculations are correct, one of\r\nthese three terminal dates will be found recorded, and the value of the\r\ncycle coefficient in A3 can be determined.\r\n\r\nThe terminal date of this Initial Series is recorded in A8-B9 and the\r\nstudent will easily read it as 8 Ahau 18 Tzec. The only difference {206}\r\nbetween the day coefficient and the month coefficient is that the latter\r\nhas a fleshless lower jaw, increasing its value by 10. Moreover, comparison\r\nof the month sign in B9 with _g_ and _h_, figure 19, shows unmistakably\r\nthat the month here recorded is Tzec. But the terminal date as recorded\r\ndoes not agree with any one of the three above terminal dates as reached by\r\ncalculation and we are forced to accept one of the two conclusions which\r\nconfronted us in the preceding text (fig. 77, A): Either the starting point\r\nof this Initial Series is not the date 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu, or there is some\r\nerror in the original text.[181]\r\n\r\nAssuming that the ancient scribes made no mistakes in this inscription, let\r\nus count backward from the recorded terminal date, 8 Ahau 18 Tzec, each of\r\nthe three numbers 2.19.13.4.0, 11.19.13.4.0, and 12.19.13.4.0, one of\r\nwhich, we have seen, is recorded in A3-B7.\r\n\r\nReducing these numbers to units of the first order by means of Table XIII,\r\nand deducting all the Calendar Rounds possible from each (see Table XVI),\r\nand, finally, applying rules 1, 2, and 3 (pp. 139, 140, and 141,\r\nrespectively), to the remainders, the starting points will be found to be:\r\n\r\n  7 Ahau 3 Mol  for  2.19.13.4.0\r\n  3 Ahau 18 Mac for 11.19.13.4.0\r\n  4 Ahau 8 Zotz for 12.19.13.4.0\r\n\r\nWhich of these starting points are we to accept as the one from which this\r\nnumber is counted? The correct answer to this question will give at the\r\nsame time the value of the cycle coefficient, which, as we have seen, must\r\nbe 2, 11, or 12. Most Maya students have accepted as the starting point of\r\nthis Initial-series number the last of the three dates above given, 4 Ahau\r\n8 Zotz, which involves also the identification of the cycle coefficient in\r\nA3 as 12. The writer has reached the same conclusion from the following\r\npoints:\r\n\r\n1. The cycle coefficient in A3, except for its very unusual headdress, is\r\nalmost identical with the other two head-variant numerals, whose values are\r\nknown to be 12. These three head numerals are shown side by side in figure\r\n52, _t-v, t_ being the form in A3 above, inserted in this figure for the\r\nsake of comparison. Although these three heads show no single element or\r\ncharacteristic that is present in all (see p. 100), each is very similar to\r\nthe other two and at the same time is dissimilar from all other\r\nhead-variant numerals. This fact warrants the conclusion that the head in\r\nA3 represents the numeral 12, and if this is so the starting point of the\r\nInitial Series under discussion is 4 Ahau 8 Zotz.\r\n\r\n2. Aside from the fact that 12 seems to be the best reading of the head in\r\nA3, and consequently that the starting point of this number is 4 Ahau 8\r\nZotz, the writer believes that 4 Ahau 8 Zotz should be selected, if for no\r\nother reason than that another Initial Series has been found which proceeds\r\nfrom this same date, while no other Initial Series known is counted from\r\neither 7 Ahau 3 Mol or 3 Ahau 18 Mac.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INITIAL SERIES AND SECONDARY SERIES ON LINTEL 21,\r\nYAXCHILAN]\r\n\r\n{207}\r\n\r\nAs we have seen in discussing the preceding text, from the east side of\r\nStela C at Quirigua (fig. 77, _A_), the Initial Series there recorded was\r\ncounted from the same starting point, 4 Ahau 8 Zotz, as the Initial Series\r\nfrom the Temple of the Cross at Palenque, if we read the latter as\r\n12.19.13.4.0. This coincidence, the writer believes, is sufficient to\r\nwarrant the identification of the head in A3 (fig. 77, _B_) as the head\r\nnumeral 12 and the acceptance of this Initial Series as proceeding from the\r\nsame starting point as the Quirigua text just described, namely, the date 4\r\nAhau 8 Zotz. With these two examples the discussion of Initial-series texts\r\nwill be closed.\r\n\r\nTEXTS RECORDING INITIAL SERIES AND SECONDARY SERIES\r\n\r\nIt has been explained (see pp. 74-76) that in addition to Initial-series\r\ndating the Maya had another method of expressing their dates, known as\r\nSecondary Series, which was used when more than one date had to be recorded\r\non the same monument. It was stated, further, that the accuracy of\r\nSecondary-series dating depended solely on the question whether or not the\r\nSecondary Series was referred to some date whose position in the Long Count\r\nwas fixed either by the record of its Initial Series or in some other way.\r\nThe next class of texts to be presented will be those showing the use of\r\nSecondary Series in connection with an Initial Series, by means of which\r\nthe Initial-series values of the Secondary-series dates, that is, their\r\nproper positions in the Long Count, may be worked out even though they are\r\nnot recorded in the text.\r\n\r\nThe first example presented will be the inscription on Lintel 21 at\r\nYaxchilan, which is figured in plate 16.[182] As usual, when an Initial\r\nSeries is recorded, the introducing glyph opens the text and this sign\r\nappears in A1, being followed by the Initial-series number itself in B1-B3.\r\nThis the student will readily decipher as 9.0.19.2.4, recording apparently\r\na very early date in Maya history, within 20 years of 9.0.0.0.0 8 Ahau 13\r\nCeh, the date arbitrarily fixed by the writer as the opening of the first\r\ngreat period.\r\n\r\nReducing this number by means of Table XIII to units of the first\r\norder[183] and deducting all the Calendar Rounds possible, 68 (see Table\r\nXVI), and applying rules 1, 2, and 3 (pp. 139, 140, and 141, respectively)\r\nto the remainder, the terminal date reached will be 2 Kan 2 Yax. This date\r\nthe student will find recorded in A4 and A7a, glyph B6b being the\r\nmonth-sign \"indicator,\" or the closing glyph of the {208} Supplementary\r\nSeries, here shown with the coefficient 9. Compare the day sign in A4a with\r\nthe sign for Kan in figure 16, _f_, and the month sign in A7a with the sign\r\nfor Yax in figure 19, _q, r_. We have then recorded in A1-A4[184], and A7a\r\nthe Initial-series date 9.0.19.2.4 2 Kan 2 Yax. At first sight it would\r\nappear that this early date indicates the time at or near which this lintel\r\nwas inscribed, but a closer examination reveals a different condition.\r\nFollowing along through the glyphs of this text, there is reached in C3-C4\r\nstill another number in which the normal forms of the katun, tun, and uinal\r\nsigns clearly appear in connection with bar and dot coefficients. The\r\nquestion at once arises, Has the number recorded here anything to do with\r\nthe Initial Series, which precedes it at the beginning of this text?\r\n\r\nLet us first examine this number before attempting to answer the above\r\nquestion. It is apparent at the outset that it differs from the\r\nInitial-series numbers previously encountered in several respects:\r\n\r\n1. There is no introducing glyph, a fact which at once eliminates the\r\npossibility that it might be an Initial Series.\r\n\r\n2. There is no kin period glyph, the uinal sign in C3 having two\r\ncoefficients instead of one.\r\n\r\n3. The order of the period glyphs is reversed, the highest period, here the\r\nkatun, closing the series instead of commencing it as heretofore.\r\n\r\nIt has been explained (see p. 129) that in Secondary Series the order of\r\nthe period glyphs is almost invariably the reverse of that shown by the\r\nperiod glyphs in Initial Series; and further, that the former are usually\r\npresented as ascending series, that is, with the lowest units first, and\r\nthe latter invariably as descending series, with the highest units first.\r\nIt has been explained also (see p. 128) that in Secondary Series the kin\r\nperiod glyph is usually omitted, the kin coefficient being attached to the\r\nleft of the uinal sign. Since both of these points (see 2 and 3, above) are\r\ncharacteristic of the number in C3-C4, it is probable that a Secondary\r\nSeries is recorded here, and that it expresses 5 kins, 16 uinals, 1 tun,\r\nand 15 katuns. Reversing this, and writing it according to the notation\r\nfollowed by most Maya students (see p. 138, footnote 1), we have as the\r\nnumber recorded by C3-C4, 15.1.16.5.\r\n\r\nReducing this number to units of the first order by means of Table XIII, we\r\nhave:\r\n\r\n  C4 = 15 × 7,200 = 108,000\r\n  D3 =  1 ×   360 =     360\r\n  C3 = 16 ×    20 =     320\r\n  C3 =  5 ×     1 =       5\r\n                    -------\r\n                    108,685\r\n\r\nSince all the Calendar Rounds which this number contains, 5 (see {209}\r\nTable XVI) may be deducted from it without affecting its value, we can\r\nfurther reduce it to 13,785 (108,685 - 94,900), and this will be the number\r\nused in the following calculations.\r\n\r\nIt was stated (on p. 135) in describing the direction of the count that\r\nnumbers are usually counted forward from the dates next preceding them in a\r\ntext, although this is not invariably true. Applying this rule to the\r\npresent case, it is probable that the Secondary-series number 15.1.16.5,\r\nwhich we have reduced to 13,785 units of the first order, is counted\r\n_forward_ from the date 2 Kan 2 Yax, the one next preceding it in our text,\r\na date, moreover, the Initial-series value of which is known.\r\n\r\nRemembering that this date 2 Kan 2 Yax is our new starting point, and that\r\nthe count is forward, by applying rules 1, 2, and 3 (pp. 139, 140, and 141,\r\nrespectively), to 13,785, the new terminal date reached will be 7 Muluc 17\r\nTzec; and this date is recorded in C5-D5. Compare C5 with the sign for the\r\nday Muluc in figure 16, _m, n_, and D5 with the sign for the month Tzec in\r\nfigure 19, _g, h_. Furthermore, by adding the Secondary-series number\r\n15.1.16.5 to 9.0.19.2.4 (the Initial-series number which fixes the position\r\nof the date 2 Kan 2 Yax in the Long Count), the Initial-series value of the\r\nterminal date of the Secondary Series (calculated and identified above as 7\r\nMuluc 17 Tzec) can also be determined as follows:\r\n\r\n  9. 0.19. 2.4    2 Kan   2 Yax        Initial Series\r\n    15. 1.16.5                         Secondary-series number\r\n  9.16. 1. 0.9    7 Muluc 17 Tzec      Initial Series of the\r\n                                       Secondary-series\r\n                                       terminal date 7 Muluc\r\n                                       17 Tzec\r\n\r\nThe student may verify the above calculations by treating 9.16.1.0.9 as a\r\nnew Initial-series number, and counting it forward from 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu, the\r\nstarting point of Maya chronology. The terminal date reached will be found\r\nto be the same date as the one recorded in C5-D5, namely, 7 Muluc 17 Tzec.\r\n\r\nWhat is the meaning then of this text, which records two dates nearly 300\r\nyears apart?[185] It must be admitted at the outset that the nature of the\r\nevents which occurred on these two dates, a matter probably set forth in\r\nthe glyphs of unknown meaning in the text, is totally unknown. It is\r\npossible to gather from other sources, however, some little data concerning\r\ntheir significance. In the first place, 9.16.1.0.9 7 Muluc 17 Tzec is\r\nalmost surely the \"contemporaneous date\" of this lintel, the date\r\nindicating the time at or near which it was formally dedicated or put into\r\nuse. This point is established almost to a certainty by the fact that all\r\nthe other dates known at Yaxchilan are very much nearer to 9.16.1.0.9 7\r\nMuluc 17 Tzec in point {210} of time than to 9.0.19.2.4 2 Kan 2 Yax, the\r\nInitial-series date recorded on this lintel. Indeed, while they range from\r\n9 days[186] to 75 years from the former, the one nearest the latter is more\r\nthan 200 years later. This practically proves that 9.16.1.0.9 7 Muluc 17\r\nTzec indicates the \"contemporaneous time\" of this lintel and that\r\n9.0.19.2.4 2 Kan 2 Yax referred to some earlier event which took place\r\nperhaps even before the founding of the city. And finally, since this\r\ninscription is on a lintel, we may perhaps go a step further and hazard the\r\nconclusion that 9.16.1.0.9 7 Muluc 17 Tzec records the date of the erection\r\nof the structure of which this lintel is a part.\r\n\r\nWe may draw from this inscription a conclusion which will be found to hold\r\ngood in almost all cases, namely, that the last date in a text almost\r\nalways indicates the \"contemporaneous time\" of the monument upon which it\r\nappears. In the present text, for example, the Secondary-series date 7\r\nMuluc 17 Tzec, the Initial-series value of which was found to be\r\n9.16.1.0.9, is in all probability its contemporaneous date, or very near\r\nthereto. It will be well to remember this important point, since it enables\r\nus to assign monuments upon which several different dates are recorded to\r\ntheir proper periods in the Long Count.\r\n\r\nThe next example illustrating the use of Secondary Series with an Initial\r\nSeries is the inscription from Stela 1 at Piedras Negras, figured in plate\r\n17.[187] The order of the glyphs in this text is somewhat irregular. It\r\nwill be noted that there is an uneven number of glyph columns, so that one\r\ncolumn will have to be read by itself. The natural assumption would be that\r\nA and B, C and D, and E and F are read together, leaving G, the last\r\ncolumn, to be read by itself. This is not the case, however, for A,\r\npresenting the Initial Series, is read first, and then B C, D E, and F G,\r\nin pairs. The introducing glyph of the Initial Series appears in A1 and is\r\nfollowed by the Initial-series number 9.12.2.0.16 in A2-A6. The student\r\nshould be perfectly familiar by this time with the processes involved in\r\ncounting this number from its starting point, and should have no difficulty\r\nin determing by calculation the terminal date recorded in A7, C2, namely, 5\r\nCib 14 Yaxkin.[188] Compare A7 with the sign for Cib in figure 16, _z_, and\r\nC2 with the sign for Yaxkin in figure 19, _k, l_. The Initial Series\r\nrecorded in A1-A7, C2 is 9.12.2.0.16 5 Cib 14 Yaxkin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INITIAL SERIES AND SECONDARY SERIES ON STELA 1,\r\nPIEDRAS NEGRAS]\r\n\r\n{211}\r\n\r\nPassing over the glyphs in B3-E1, the meanings of which are unknown, we\r\nreach in D2 E2 a number showing very clearly the tun and uinal signs, the\r\nlatter having two coefficients instead of one. Moreover, the order of these\r\nperiod glyphs is reversed, the lower standing first in the series. As\r\nexplained in connection with the preceding text, these points are both\r\ncharacteristic of Secondary-series numbers, and we may conclude therefore\r\nthat D2 E2 records a number of this kind. Finally, since the kin\r\ncoefficient in Secondary Series usually appears on the left of the uinal\r\nsign, we may express this number in the commonly accepted notation as\r\nfollows: 12.9.15. Reducing this to units of the first order, we have:\r\n\r\n  E2 = 12 × 360 = 4,320\r\n  D2 =  9 ×  20 =   180\r\n  D2 = 15 ×   1 =    15\r\n                  -----\r\n                  4,515\r\n\r\nRemembering that Secondary-series numbers are usually counted from the\r\ndates next preceding them in the texts, in this case 5 Cib 14 Yaxkin, and\r\nproceeding according to rules 1, 2, and 3 (pp. 139, 140, and 141,\r\nrespectively), the terminal date of the Secondary Series reached will be 9\r\nChuen 9 Kankin, which is recorded in F1 G1, though unfortunately these\r\nglyphs are somewhat effaced. Moreover, since the position of 5 Cib 14\r\nYaxkin in the Long Count is known, that is, its Initial-series value, it is\r\npossible to determine the Initial-series value of this new date, 9 Chuen 9\r\nKankin:\r\n\r\n  9.12. 2. 0.16    5 Cib   14 Yaxkin\r\n       12. 9.15\r\n  9.12.14.10.11    9 Chuen  9 Kankin\r\n\r\nBut the end of this text has not been reached with the date 9 Chuen 9\r\nKankin in F1 G1. Passing over F2 G2, the meanings of which are unknown, we\r\nreach in F3 an inverted Ahau with the coefficient 5 above it. As explained\r\non page 72, this probably signifies 5 kins, the inversion of the glyph\r\nchanging its meaning from that of a particular day sign, Ahau, to a general\r\nsign for the kin day period (see fig. 34, _d_). The writer recalls but one\r\nother instance in which the inverted Ahau stands for the kin sign--on the\r\nnorth side of Stela C at Quirigua.\r\n\r\nWe have then another Secondary-series number consisting of 5 kins, which is\r\nto be counted from some date, and since Secondary-series numbers are\r\nusually counted from the date next preceding them in the text, we are\r\njustified in assuming that 9 Chuen 9 Kankin is our new starting point.\r\n\r\nCounting 5 forward from this date, according to rules 1, 2, and 3 (pp. 139,\r\n140, and 141, respectively), the terminal date reached will be 1 Cib 14\r\nKankin, and this latter date is recorded in G3-G4. Compare G3 with the sign\r\nfor Cib in A7 and in figure 16, _z_, and G4 with the sign for Kankin in\r\nfigure 19, _y, z_. Moreover, since the Initial-series value of 9 Chuen 9\r\nKankin was calculated above as 9.12.14.10.11, {212} the Initial-series\r\nvalue of this new date, 1 Cib 14 Kankin, also can be calculated from it:\r\n\r\n  9.12.14.10.11    9 Chuen 9 Kankin\r\n              5\r\n  9.12.14.10.16    1 Cib  14 Kankin\r\n\r\nPassing over G5 as unknown, we reach in G6-G7 another Secondary-series\r\nnumber. The student will have little difficulty in identifying G6 as 2\r\nuinals, 5 kins, and G7 as 1 katun. It will be noted that no tun sign\r\nappears in this number, which is a very unusual condition. By far the\r\ncommoner practice in such cases in which 0 units of some period are\r\ninvolved is to record the period with a coefficient 0. However, this was\r\nnot done in the present case, and since no tuns are recorded, we may\r\nconclude that none were involved, and G6-G7 may be written 1.(0).2.5.\r\nReducing this number to units of the first order, we have:\r\n\r\n    G7 =  1 × 7,200 = 7,200\r\n  ([189]) 0 ×   360 =     0\r\n    G6 =  2 ×    20 =    40\r\n    G6 =  5 ×     1 =     5\r\n                      -----\r\n                      7,245\r\n\r\nRemembering that the starting point from which this number is counted is\r\nthe date next preceding it, 1 Cib 14 Kankin, and applying rules 1, 2, and 3\r\n(pp. 139, 140, and 141, respectively), the terminal date reached will be 5\r\nImix 19 Zac; this latter date is recorded in G8-G9. Compare G8 with the\r\nsign for Imix in figure 16, _a, b_, and G9 with the sign for Zac in figure\r\n19, _s, t_. Moreover, since the Initial Series of 1 Cib 14 Kankin was\r\nobtained by calculation from the date next preceding it, the Initial Series\r\nof 5 Imix 19 Zac may be determined in the same way.\r\n\r\n  9.12.  14.     10.16    1 Cib 14 Kankin\r\n     1.   0.[189] 2. 5\r\n  9.13.  14.     13. 1    5 Imix 19 Zac\r\n\r\nWith the above date closes the known part of this text, the remaining\r\nglyphs, G10-G12, being of unknown meaning.\r\n\r\nAssembling all the glyphs deciphered above, the known part of this text\r\nreads as follows:\r\n\r\n  9.12.  2.     0.16  A1-A7, C2  5 Cib 14 Yaxkin\r\n        12.     9.15  D2 E2\r\n  9.12. 14.    10.11  F1 G1      9 Chuen 9 Kankin\r\n                   5  F3\r\n  9.12. 14.    10.16  G3 G4      1 Cib 14 Kankin\r\n     1. 0.[189] 2. 5  G6 G7\r\n  9.13. 14.    13. 1  G8 G9      5 Imix 19 Zac\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INITIAL SERIES (_A_) AND SECONDARY SERIES (_B_) ON STELA\r\nK, QUIRIGUA]\r\n\r\n{213} We have recorded here four different dates, of which the last,\r\n9.13.14.13.1 5 Imix 19 Zac, probably represents the actual date, or very\r\nnear thereto, of this monument.[190] The period covered between the first\r\nand last of these dates is about 32 years, within the range of a single\r\nlifetime or, indeed, of the tenure of some important office by a single\r\nindividual. The unknown glyphs again probably set forth the nature of the\r\nevents which occurred on the dates recorded.\r\n\r\nIn the two preceding texts the Secondary Series given are regular in every\r\nway. Not only was the count forward each time, but it also started in every\r\ncase from the date immediately preceding the number counted. This\r\nregularity, however, is far from universal in Secondary-series texts, and\r\nthe following examples comprise some of the more common departures from the\r\nusual practice.\r\n\r\nIn plate 18 is figured the Initial Series from Stela K at Quirigua.[191]\r\nThe text opens on the north side of this monument (see pl. 18, _A_) with\r\nthe introducing glyph in A1-B2. This is followed by the Initial-series\r\nnumber 9.18.15.0.0 in A3-B4, which leads to the terminal date 3 Ahau 3 Yax.\r\nThe day part of this date the student will find recorded in its regular\r\nposition, A5a. Passing over A5b and B5, the meanings of which are unknown,\r\nwe reach in A6 a Secondary-series number composed very clearly of 10 uinals\r\nand 10 kins (10.10), which reduces to the following number of units of the\r\nfirst order:\r\n\r\n  A6 = 10 × 20 = 200\r\n  A6 = 10 ×  1 =  10\r\n                 ---\r\n                 210\r\n\r\nThe first assumption is that this number is counted forward from the\r\nterminal date of the Initial Series, 3 Ahau 3 Yax, and performing the\r\noperations indicated in rules 1, 2, and 3 (pp. 139, 140, and 141,\r\nrespectively) the terminal date reached will be 5 Oc 8 Uo. Now, although\r\nthe day sign in B6b is clearly Oc (see fig. 16, _o-q_), its coefficient is\r\nvery clearly 1, not 5, and, moreover, the month in A7a is unmistakably 18\r\nKayab (see fig. 19, _d'-f'_). Here then instead of finding the date\r\ndetermined by calculation, 5 Oc 8 Uo, the date recorded is 1 Oc 18 Kayab,\r\nand consequently there is some departure from the practices heretofore\r\nencountered.\r\n\r\nSince the association of the number 10.10 is so close with (1) the terminal\r\ndate of the Initial Series, 3 Ahau 3 Yax, and (2) the date 1 Oc 18 Kayab\r\nalmost immediately following it, it would almost seem as though these two\r\ndates must be the starting point and terminal date, respectively, of this\r\nnumber. If the count is forward, we have just proved that this can not be\r\nthe case; so let us next count the {214} number backward and see whether we\r\ncan reach the date recorded in B6b-A7a (1 Oc 18 Kayab) in this way.\r\n\r\nCounting 210 _backward_ from 3 Ahau 3 Yax, according to rules 1, 2, and 3\r\n(pp. 139, 140, and 141, respectively), the terminal date reached will be 1\r\nOc 18 Kayab, as recorded in B6b-A7. In other words, the Secondary Series in\r\nthis text is counted backward from the Initial Series, and therefore\r\nprecedes it in point of time. This will appear from the Initial-series\r\nvalue of 1 Oc 18 Kayab, which may be determined by calculation:\r\n\r\n  9.18.15. 0. 0    3 Ahau 3 Yax\r\n          10.10\r\n  9.18.14. 7.10    1 Oc 18 Kayab\r\n\r\nThis text closes on the south side of the monument in a very unusual manner\r\n(see pl. 18, _B_). In B3a appears the month-sign indicator, here recorded\r\nas a head variant with a coefficient 10, and following immediately in B3b a\r\nSecondary-series number composed of 0 uinals and 0 kins, or, in other\r\nwords, nothing. It is obvious that in counting this number 0.0, or nothing,\r\neither backward or forward from the date next preceding it in the text, 1\r\nOc 18 Kayab in B6b-A7a on the north side of the stela, the same date 1 Oc\r\n18 Kayab will remain. But this date is not repeated in A4, where the\r\nterminal date of this Secondary Series, 0.0, seems to be recorded. However,\r\nif we count 0.0 from the terminal date of the Initial Series, 3 Ahau 3 Yax,\r\nwe reach the date recorded in A4, 3 Ahau 3 Yax,[192] and this whole text so\r\nfar as deciphered will read:\r\n\r\n  9.18.15. 0. 0  3 Ahau 3 Yax\r\n          10.10  backward\r\n  9.18.14. 7.10  1 Oc 18 Kayab\r\n           0. 0  forward from Initial Series\r\n  9.18.15. 0. 0  3 Ahau 3 Yax\r\n\r\nThe reason for recording a Secondary-series number equal to zero, the\r\nwriter believes, was because the first Secondary-series date 1 Oc 18 Kayab\r\nprecedes the Initial-series date, which in this case marks the time at\r\nwhich this monument was erected. Hence, in order to have the closing date\r\non the monument record the contemporaneous time of the monument, it was\r\nnecessary to repeat the Initial-series date; this was accomplished by\r\nadding to it a Secondary-series date denoting zero. Stela K is the next to\r\nthe latest hotun-marker at Quirigua following immediately Stela I, the\r\nInitial series of which marks the hotun ending 9.18.10.0.0 10 Ahau 8 Zac\r\n(see pl. 6, _C_).\r\n\r\nMr. Bowditch (1910: p. 208) has advanced a very plausible explanation to\r\naccount for the presence of the date 9.18.14.7.10 1 Oc 18 Kayab {215} on\r\nthis monument. He shows that at the time when Stela K was erected, namely,\r\n9.18.15.0.0 3 Ahau 3 Yax, the official calendar had outrun the seasons by\r\njust 210 days, or exactly the number of days recorded in A6, plate 18, A\r\n(north side); and further, that instead of being the day 3 Yax, which\r\noccurred at Quirigua about the beginning of the dry season,[193] in reality\r\nthe season was 210 days behind, or at 18 Kayab, about the beginning of the\r\nrainy season. This very great discrepancy between calendar and season could\r\nnot have escaped the notice of the priests, and the 210 days recorded in A6\r\nmay well represent the days actually needed on the date 9.18.15.0.0 3 Ahau\r\n3 Yax to bring the calendar into harmony with the current season. If this\r\nbe true, then the date 9.18.14.7.0 1 Oc 18 Kayab represented the day\r\nindicated by the sun when the calendar showed that the 3d hotun in Katun 18\r\nof Cycle 9 had been completed. Mr. Bowditch suggests the following free\r\ninterpretation of this passage: \"The sun has just set at its northern\r\npoint[194] and we are counting the day 3 Yax--210 days from 18 Kayab--which\r\nis the true date in the calendar according to our traditions and records\r\nfor the sun to set at this point on his course.\" As stated above, the\r\nwriter believes this to be the true explanation of the record of 210 days\r\non this monument.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 78. The Initial Series on Stela J, Quirigua.]\r\n\r\nIn figures 78 and 79 are illustrated the Initial Series and Secondary\r\nSeries from Stela J at Quirigua.[195] For lack of space the introducing\r\nglyph in this text has been omitted; it occupies the position of six\r\nglyph-blocks, however, A1-B3, after which the Initial-series number\r\n9.16.5.0.0 follows in A4-B8. This leads to the terminal date 8 Ahau 8 Zotz,\r\nwhich is recorded in A9, B9, B13, the glyph in A13 being the month-sign\r\nindicator here shown with the coefficient 9. Compare B9 with the second\r\nvariant for Ahau in figure 16 _h', i'_, and B13 with the sign for Zotz in\r\nfigure 19, _e, f_. The {216} Initial-series part of this text therefore in\r\nA1-B9, B13, is perfectly regular and reads as follows: 9.16.5.0.0 8 Ahau 8\r\nZotz. The Secondary Series, however, are unusual and differ in several\r\nrespects from the ones heretofore presented.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 79. The Secondary Series on Stela J, Quirigua.]\r\n\r\nThe first Secondary Series inscribed on this monument (see fig. 79, _A_) is\r\nat B1-B2. This series the student should readily decipher as 3 kins, 13\r\nuinals, 11 tuns, and 0 katuns, which we may write 0.11.13.3. This number\r\npresents one feature, which, so far as the writer knows, is unique in the\r\nwhole range of Maya texts. The highest order of units actually involved in\r\nthis number is the tun, but for some unknown reason the ancient scribe saw\r\nfit to add the katun sign also, B2, which, however, he proceeded to nullify\r\nat once by attaching to it the coefficient 0. For in so far as the\r\nnumerical value is concerned, 11.13.3 and 0.11.13.3 are equal. The next\r\npeculiarity is that the date which follows this number in B3-A4 is not its\r\nterminal date, as we have every reason to expect, but, on the contrary, its\r\nstarting point. In other words, in this Secondary Series the starting point\r\nfollows instead of precedes the number counted from it. This date is very\r\nclearly 12 Caban 5 Kayab; compare B3 with the sign for Caban in figure 16,\r\n_a', b'_, and A4 with the sign for Kayab in figure 19, _d'-f'_. So far as\r\nStela J is concerned there is no record of the position which this date\r\noccupied in the Long Count; that is, there are no data by means of which\r\nits Initial Series may be calculated. Elsewhere at Quirigua, however, this\r\ndate is recorded twice as an Initial Series and in each place it has the\r\nsame value, 9.14.13.4.17. We may safely conclude, therefore, that the date\r\nin A3-B4 is 9.14.13.4.17 12 Caban 5 Kayab, and use it in our calculations\r\nas such. Reducing 0.11.13.3 to units of the first order, we have:\r\n\r\n  B2 =  0 × 7,200 =     0\r\n  A2 = 11 ×   360 = 3,960\r\n  B1 = 13 ×    20 =   260\r\n  B1 =  3 ×     1 =     3\r\n                    -----\r\n                    4,223\r\n\r\n{217} Applying rules 1, 2, and 3 (pp. 139, 140, and 141, respectively) to\r\nthis number, the terminal date reached will be 10 Ahau 8 Chen, which is\r\nnowhere recorded in the text (see fig. 79, A).\r\n\r\nThe Initial Series corresponding to this date, however, may be calculated\r\nfrom the Initial Series which we have assigned to the date 12 Caban 5\r\nKayab:\r\n\r\n  9.14.13. 4.17    12 Caban 5 Kayab\r\n     0.11.13. 3\r\n  9.15. 5. 0. 0    10 Ahau  8 Chen\r\n\r\nAlthough the date 9.15.5.0.0 10 Ahau 8 Chen is not actually recorded at\r\nQuirigua, it is reached on another monument by calculation just as here. It\r\nhas a peculiar fitness here on Stela J in that it is just one katun earlier\r\nthan the Initial Series on this monument (see fig. 78), 9.16.5.0.0 8 Ahau 8\r\nZotz.\r\n\r\nThe other Secondary Series on this monument (see fig. 79, _B_) appears at\r\nB1-A2, and records 18 tuns, 3 uinals, and 14 kins, which we may write thus:\r\n18.3.14. As in the preceding case, the date following this number in B2-A3\r\nis its starting point, not its terminal date, a very unusual feature, as\r\nhas been explained. This date is 6 Cimi 4 Tzec--compare B2 with the sign\r\nfor Cimi in figure 16, _h, i_, and A3 with the sign for Tzec in figure 19,\r\n_g, h_--and as far as Stela J is concerned it is not fixed in the Long\r\nCount. However, elsewhere at Quirigua this date is recorded in a Secondary\r\nSeries, which is referred back to an Initial Series, and from this passage\r\nits corresponding Initial Series is found to be 9.15.6.14.6 6 Cimi 4 Tzec.\r\nReducing the number recorded in B1-A2, 18.3.14, to units of the first\r\norder, we have:\r\n\r\n  A2 = 18 × 360 = 6,480\r\n  B2 =  3 ×  20 =    60\r\n  B2 = 14 ×   1 =    14\r\n                  -----\r\n                  6,554\r\n\r\nApplying rules 1, 2, and 3 (pp. 139, 140, and 141, respectively) to the\r\nnumber, the terminal date reached will be 8 Ahau 8 Zotz, which does not\r\nappear in figure 79, _B_. The Initial Series corresponding to this date may\r\nbe calculated as follows:\r\n\r\n  9.15. 6.14. 6 6 Cimi 4 Tzec\r\n       18. 3.14\r\n  9.16. 5. 0. 0 8 Ahau 8 Zotz\r\n\r\nBut this was the Initial Series recorded on the reverse of this monument,\r\nconsequently the Secondary-series dates, both of which have {218} preceded\r\nthe Initial-series date in point of time, bring this count up to the\r\ncontemporaneous time of this monument, which was 9.16.5.0.0 8 Ahau 8 Zotz.\r\nIn view of the fact that the Secondary Series on Stela J are both earlier\r\nthan the Initial Series, the chronological sequence of the several dates is\r\nbetter preserved by regarding the Initial Series as being at the close of\r\nthe inscription instead of at the beginning, thus:\r\n\r\n   9.14.13. 4.17   12 Caban 5 Kayab   Figure 79, _A_, B3-A4\r\n      0.11.13. 3                                      B1-B2\r\n  [9.15. 5. 0. 0] [10 Ahau 8 Chen][196]\r\n        [1.14. 6][197]\r\n   9.15. 6.14. 6   6 Cimi 4 Tzec      Figure 79, _B_, B2-A3\r\n        18. 3.14                                      B1-A2\r\n   9.16. 5. 0. 0   8 Ahau 8 Zotz      Figure 78,      A1-B9, B13\r\n\r\nBy the above arrangement all the dates present in the text lead up to\r\n9.16.5.0.0 8 Ahau 8 Zotz as the most important date, because it alone\r\nrecords the particular hotun-ending which Stela J marks. The importance of\r\nthis date over the others is further emphasized by the fact that it alone\r\nappears as an Initial Series.\r\n\r\nThe text of Stela J illustrates two points in connection with Secondary\r\nSeries which the student will do well to bear in mind: (1) The starting\r\npoints of Secondary-series numbers do not always precede the numbers\r\ncounted from them, and (2) the terminal dates and starting points are not\r\nalways both recorded.\r\n\r\nThe former point will be illustrated in the following example:\r\n\r\nIn plate 19, _A_, is figured the Initial Series from the west side of Stela\r\nF at Quirigua.[198] The introducing glyph appears in A1-B2 and is followed\r\nby the Initial-series number in A3-A5. This is expressed by head variants\r\nand reads as follows: 9.14.13.4.17. The terminal date reached by this\r\nnumber is 12 Caban 5 Kayab, which is recorded in B5-A6. The student will\r\nreadily identify the numerals as above by comparing them with the forms in\r\nfigures 51-53, and the day and month signs by comparing them with figures\r\n16, _a', b'_, and 19, _d'-f'_, respectively. The Initial Series therefore\r\nreads 9.14.13.4.17 12 Caban 5 Kayab.[199]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INITIAL SERIES (_A_) AND SECONDARY SERIES (_B_) ON STELA F\r\n(WEST SIDE), QUIRIGUA]\r\n\r\n{219}\r\n\r\nPassing over B6-A10, the meanings of which are unknown, we reach in B10 the\r\nSecondary-series number 13.9.9. Reducing this to units of the first order,\r\nwe have:\r\n\r\n  B10b  = 13 × 360 = 4,680\r\n  B10a  =  9 ×  20 =   180\r\n  B10a  =  9 ×   1 =     9\r\n                     -----\r\n                     4,869\r\n\r\nAssuming that our starting point is the date next preceding this number in\r\nthe text, that is, the Initial-series terminal date 12 Caban 5 Kayab in\r\nB5-A6, and applying rules 1, 2, and 3 (pp. 139, 140, and 141,\r\nrespectively), the terminal day reached will be 6 Cimi 4 Tzec. This date\r\nthe student will find recorded in plate 19, _B_, B11b-A12a. Compare B11b\r\nwith the sign for Cimi in figure 16, _h, i_, and A12a with the sign for\r\nTzec in figure 19, _g, h_. Moreover, since the Initial-series value of the\r\nstarting point 12 Caban 5 Kayab is known, the Initial-series value of the\r\nterminal date 6 Cimi 4 Tzec may be calculated from it:\r\n\r\n  9.14.13. 4.17    12 Caban 5 Kayab\r\n       13. 9. 9\r\n  9.15. 6.14. 6     6 Cimi 4 Tzec[200]\r\n\r\nIn A15 is recorded the date 3 Ahau 3 Mol (compare A15a with fig. 16, _k',\r\ni'_, and A15b with fig. 19, _m, n_) and in A17 the date 4 Ahau 13 Yax\r\n(compare A17a with fig. 16, _e'-g'_ and A17b with fig. 19, _q, r_). This\r\nlatter date, 4 Ahau 13 Yax, is recorded elsewhere at Quirigua in a\r\nSecondary Series attached to an Initial Series, where it has the\r\nInitial-series value 9.15.0.0.0. This value we may assume, therefore,\r\nbelongs to it in the present case, giving us the full date 9.15.0.0.0 4\r\nAhau 13 Yax. For the present let us pass over the first of these two dates,\r\nnamely, 3 Ahau 3 Mol, the Initial Series of which as well as the reason for\r\nits record here will better appear later.\r\n\r\nIn B17-A18a is recorded another Secondary-series number composed of 3 kins,\r\n13 uinals, 16 tuns, and 1 katun, which we may write thus: 1.16.13.3. The\r\nstudent will note that the katun coefficient in A18a is expressed by an\r\nunusual form, the thumb. As explained on page 103, this has a numerical\r\nvalue of 1. Again, our text presents another irregular feature. Instead of\r\nbeing counted either forward or backward from the date next preceding it in\r\nthe text; that is, 4 Ahau 13 Yax in A17, this number is counted from the\r\ndate following it in the text, like the two Secondary-series numbers in\r\nStela J, just discussed. This starting date recorded in A18b B18a is 12\r\nCaban 5 Kayab, which, as we have seen, is also the date recorded by the\r\nInitial Series in plate 19, _A_, A1-A6. We are perfectly justified in {220}\r\nassuming, therefore, that the 12 Caban 5 Kayab in A18b-B18a had the same\r\nInitial-series value as the 12 Caban 5 Kayab in plate 19, _A_, B5-A6,\r\nnamely, 9.14.13.4.17. Reducing the number in B17-A18a, namely, 1.16.13.3,\r\nto units of the first order, we have:\r\n\r\n  A18a =  1 × 7,200 =  7,200\r\n  B17b = 16 ×   360 =  5,760\r\n  B17a = 13 ×    20 =    260\r\n  B17a =  3 ×     1 =      3\r\n                      ------\r\n                      13,223\r\n\r\nRemembering that this number is to be counted forward from the date 12\r\nCaban 5 Kayab, and applying rules 1, 2, and 3 (pp. 139, 140, and 141,\r\nrespectively), the terminal date reached will be 1 Ahau 3 Zip, which is\r\nrecorded in A19. Compare the coefficient of the day sign in A19a with the\r\ncoefficient of the katun sign in A18a, and the day sign itself with the\r\nprofile variant for Ahau in figure 16, _h', i'_. For the month sign,\r\ncompare A19b with figure 19, d. But since the Initial-series value of the\r\nstarting point is known, we may calculate from it the Initial-series value\r\nof the new terminal date:\r\n\r\n  9.14.13. 4.17   12 Caban 5 Kayab\r\n     1.16.13. 3\r\n  9.16.10. 0. 0   1 Ahau 3 Zip\r\n\r\nPassing over to the east side of this monument, the student will find\r\nrecorded there the continuation of this inscription (see pl. 20).[201] This\r\nside, like the other, opens with an introducing glyph A1-B2, which is\r\nfollowed by an Initial Series in A3-A5. Although this number is expressed\r\nby head variants, the forms are all familiar, and the student will have\r\nlittle difficulty in reading it as 9.16.10.0.0. The terminal date which\r\nthis number reaches is recorded in B5-B8; that is, 1[202] Ahau 3 Zip, the\r\n\"month indicator\" appearing as a head variant in A8 with the head-variant\r\ncoefficient 10. But this date is identical with the date determined by\r\ncalculation and actually recorded at the close of the inscription on the\r\nother side of this monument, and since no later date is recorded elsewhere\r\nin this text, we may conclude that 9.16.10.0.0 1 Ahau 3 Zip represents the\r\ncontemporaneous time of Stela F, and hence that it was a regular\r\nhotun-marker. Here again, as in the case of Stela J at Quirigua, the\r\nimportance of the \"contemporaneous date\" is emphasized not only by the fact\r\nthat all the other dates lead up to it, but also by the fact that it is\r\nexpressed as an Initial Series.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INITIAL SERIES ON STELA F (EAST SIDE), QUIRIGUA]\r\n\r\n{221}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 80. Glyphs which may disclose the nature of the events\r\nthat happened at Quirigua on the dates: _a_, 9. 14. 13. 4. 17 12 Caban 5\r\nKayab; _b_, 9. 15. 6. 14. 6 6 Cimi 4 Tzec.]\r\n\r\nWe have explained all the dates figured except 3 Ahau 3 Mol in plate 19,\r\n_B_, A15, the discussion of which was deferred until after the rest of the\r\ninscription had been considered. It will be remembered in connection with\r\nStela J (figs. 78, 79) that one of the dates reached in the course of the\r\ncalculations was just 1 katun earlier than the date recorded by the Initial\r\nSeries on the same monument. Now, one of the Initial-series values\r\ncorresponding to the date 3 Ahau 3 Mol here under discussion is\r\n9.15.10.0.0, exactly 1 katun earlier than the Initial-series date on Stela\r\nF. In other words, if we give to the date 3 Ahau 3 Mol in A15 the value\r\n9.15.10.0.0, the cases are exactly parallel. While it is impossible to\r\nprove that this particular Initial Series was the one which the ancient\r\nscribes had in mind when they recorded this date 3 Ahau 3 Mol, the writer\r\nbelieves that the coincidence and parallel here presented are sufficient to\r\nwarrant the assumption that this is the case. The whole text reads as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n   9.14.13. 4.17   12 Caban 5 Kayab    Plate 19, _A_, A1-A6\r\n        13. 9. 9                       Plate 19, _A_, A10\r\n   9.15. 6.14. 6   6 Cimi 4 Tzec       Plate 19, _B_, B11b-A12a\r\n  [9.15.10. 0. 0]  3 Ahau 3 Mol        Plate 19, _B_, A15\r\n  [9.15. 0. 0. 0]  4 Ahau 13 Yax       Plate 19, _B_, A17\r\n   9.14.13. 4.17   12 Caban 5 Kayab    Plate 19, _B_, A18b B18a\r\n      1.16.13. 3                       Plate 19, _B_, B17 A18a\r\n   9.16.10. 0. 0   1 Ahau 3 Zip        Plate 19, _B_, A19\r\n       (repeated as Initial Series on east side of monument)\r\n   9.16.10. 0. 0   1 Ahau 3 Zip        Plate 20, A1-B5-B8\r\n\r\nThe student will note the close similarity between this inscription and\r\nthat on Stela J (figured in figs. 78 and 79), a summary of which appears on\r\npage 239. Both commence with the same date, 9.14.13.4.17 12 Caban 5 Kayab;\r\nboth show the date 9.15.6.14.6 6 Cimi 4 Tzec; both have dates which are\r\njust 1 katun in advance of the hotuns which they mark; and finally, both\r\nare hotun-markers, Stela J preceding Stela F by just 1 hotun. The date from\r\nwhich both proceed, 9.14.13.4.17 12 Caban 5 Kayab, is an important one at\r\nQuirigua, being the earliest date there. It appears on four monuments,\r\nnamely, Stelæ J, F, and E, and Zoömorph G. Although the writer has not been\r\nable to prove the point, he is of the opinion that the glyph shown in\r\nfigure 80, _a_, tells the meaning of the event which happened on this date,\r\nwhich is, moreover, the earliest date at Quirigua which {222} it is\r\npossible to regard as being contemporaneous. Hence, it is not improbable\r\nthat it might refer to the founding of the city or some similar event,\r\nthough this is of course a matter of speculation. The fact, however, that\r\n9.14.13.4.17 12 Caban 5 Kayab is the earliest date on four different\r\nhotun-markers shows that it was of supreme importance in the history of\r\nQuirigua. This concludes the discussion of texts showing the use of\r\nSecondary Series with Initial Series.\r\n\r\nTEXTS RECORDING PERIOD ENDINGS\r\n\r\nIt was explained in Chapter III (p. 77) that in addition to Initial-series\r\ndating and Secondary-series dating, the Maya used still another method in\r\nfixing events, which was designated Period-ending dating. It was explained\r\nfurther that, although Period-ending dating was less exact than the other\r\ntwo methods, it served equally well for all practical purposes, since dates\r\nfixed by it could not recur until after a lapse of more than 18,000 years,\r\na considerably longer period than that covered by the recorded history of\r\nmankind. Finally, the student will recall that the katun was said to be the\r\nperiod most commonly used in this method of dating.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this is near at hand. Practically all of the great southern\r\ncities rose, flourished, and fell within the period called Cycle 9 of Maya\r\nchronology. There could have been no doubt throughout the southern area\r\nwhich particular cycle was meant when the \"current cycle\" was spoken of.\r\nAfter the date 9.0.0.0.0 8 Ahau 13 Ceh had ushered in a new cycle there\r\ncould be no change in the cycle coefficient until after a lapse of very\r\nnearly 400 (394.250 +) years. Consequently, after Cycle 9 had commenced\r\nmany succeeding generations of men knew no other, and in time the term\r\n\"current cycle\" came to mean as much on a monument as \"Cycle 9.\" Indeed, in\r\nPeriod-ending dating the Cycle 9 was taken for granted and scarcely ever\r\nrecorded. The same practice obtains very generally to-day in regard to\r\nwriting the current century, such expressions as July 4, '12, December 25,\r\n'13, being frequently seen in place of the full forms July 4, 1912, A. D.,\r\nDecember 25, 1913, A. D.; or again, even more briefly, 7/4/12 and 12/25/13\r\nto express the same dates, respectively. The desire for brevity, as has\r\nbeen explained, probably gave rise to Period-ending dating in the first\r\nplace, and in this method the cycle was the first period to be eliminated\r\nas superfluous for all practical purposes. No one could have forgotten the\r\nnumber of the current cycle.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to the next lower period, however, the katun, we find a\r\ndifferent state of affairs. The numbers belonging to this period were\r\nchanging every 20 (exactly, 19.71 +) years; that is, three or four times in\r\nthe lifetime of many individuals; hence, there was plenty of opportunity\r\nfor confusion about the number of the katun in which a particular event\r\noccurred. Consequently, in order to insure accuracy the katun is almost\r\nalways the unit used in Period-ending dating.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EXAMPLES OF PERIOD-ENDING DATES IN CYCLE 9]\r\n\r\n{223}\r\n\r\nIn plate 21 are figured a number of Period-ending dates, the glyphs of\r\nwhich have been ranged in horizontal lines, and are numbered from left to\r\nright for convenience in reference. The true positions of these glyphs in\r\nthe texts from which they have been taken are given in the footnotes in\r\neach case. In plate 21, _A_, is figured a Period-ending date from Stela 2\r\nat Copan.[203] The date 12 Ahau 8 Ceh appears very clearly in glyphs 1 and\r\n2. Compare the month sign with figure 19, _u, v_. There follows in 3 a\r\nglyph the upper part of which probably represents the \"ending sign\" of this\r\ndate. By comparing this form with the ending signs in figure 37 its\r\nresemblance to figure 37, _o_, will be evident. Indeed, figure 37, _o_, has\r\nprecisely the same lower element as glyph 3. In glyph 4 follows the\r\nparticular katun, 11, whose end fell on the date recorded in glyphs 1 and\r\n2. The student can readily prove this for himself by reducing the\r\nPeriod-ending date here recorded to its corresponding Initial Series and\r\ncounting the resulting number forward from the common starting point, 4\r\nAhau 8 Cumhu, as follows: Since the cycle glyph is not expressed, we may\r\nfill this omission as the Maya themselves filled it, by supplying Cycle 9.\r\nMoreover, since the _end_ of a katun is recorded here, it is clear that all\r\nthe lower periods--the tuns, uinals, and kins--will have to appear with the\r\ncoefficient 0, as they are all brought to their respective ends with the\r\nending of any katun. Therefore we may write the Initial-series number\r\ncorresponding to the end of Katun 11, as 9.11.0.0.0. Treating this number\r\nas an Initial Series, that is, first reducing it to units of the first\r\norder, then deducting from it all the Calendar Rounds possible, and finally\r\napplying rules 1, 2, and 3 (pp. 139, 140, and 141, respectively) to the\r\nremainder, the student will find that the terminal date reached will be the\r\nsame as the date recorded in glyphs 1 and 2, namely, 12 Ahau 8 Ceh. In\r\nother words, the Katun 11, which ended on the date 12 Ahau 8 Ceh, was\r\n9.11.0.0.0 12 Ahau 8 Ceh, and both indicate exactly the same position in\r\nthe Long Count. The next example (pl. 21, _B_) is taken from the tablet in\r\nthe Temple of the Foliated Cross at Palenque.[204] In glyph 1 appears the\r\ndate 8 Ahau 8 Uo (compare the month form with fig. 19, _b, c_) and in glyph\r\n3 the \"ending\" of Katun 13. The ending sign here is the variant shown in\r\nfigure 37, _a-h_, and it occurs just above the coefficient 13. These two\r\nglyphs therefore record the fact that Katun 13 ended with the day 8 Ahau 8\r\nUo. The student may again test the accuracy of the record by changing this\r\nPeriod-ending date to its {224} corresponding Initial-series number,\r\n9.13.0.0.0, and performing the various operations indicated in such cases.\r\nThe resulting Initial-series terminal date will be the same as the date\r\nrecorded in glyphs 1 and 2, 8 Ahau 8 Uo.\r\n\r\nIn plate 21, _C_, is figured a Period-ending date taken from Stela 23 at\r\nNaranjo.[205] The date 6 Ahau 13 Muan appears very clearly in glyphs 1 and\r\n2 (compare the month form with fig. 19, _a', b'_). Glyph 3 is the ending\r\nsign, here showing three common \"ending elements,\" (1) the clasped hand;\r\n(2) the element with the curl infix; (3) the tassel-like postfix. Compare\r\nthis form with the ending signs in figure 37, _l-q_, and with the zero\r\nsigns in figure 54. In glyph 4 is recorded the particular katun, 14, which\r\ncame to its end on the date recorded in 1 and 2. The element prefixed to\r\nthe Katun 14 in glyph 4 is also an ending sign, though it always occurs as\r\na prefix or superfix attached to the sign of the period whose close is\r\nrecorded. Examples illustrating its use are shown in figure 37, _a-h_, with\r\nwhich the ending element in glyph 4 should be compared. The glyphs 1 to 4\r\nin plate 21, _C_, therefore record that Katun 14 came to an end on the date\r\n6 Ahau 13 Muan. As we have seen above, this could be shown to correspond\r\nwith the Initial Series 9.14.0.0.0 6 Ahau 13 Muan.\r\n\r\nThis same date, 6 Ahau 13 Muan ending Katun 14, is also recorded on Stela\r\n16 at Tikal (see pl. 21, _D_).[206] The date itself appears in glyphs 1 and\r\n2 and is followed in 3 by a sign which is almost exactly like the ending\r\nsign in glyph 3 just discussed (see pl. 21, _C_). The subfixes are\r\nidentical in both cases, and it is possible to distinguish the lines of the\r\nhand element in the weathered upper part of the glyph in 3. Compare glyph 3\r\nwith the ending signs in figure 37, _l-q_, and with the zero signs in\r\nfigure 54. As in the preceding example, glyph 4 shows the particular katun\r\nwhose end is recorded here--Katun 14. The period glyph itself appears as a\r\nhead variant to which is prefixed the same ending prefix or superfix shown\r\nwith the period glyph in the preceding example. See also figure 37, _a-h_.\r\nAs above stated, the Initial Series corresponding to this date is\r\n9.14.0.0.0 6 Ahau 13 Muan.\r\n\r\nOne more example will suffice to illustrate the use of katun Period-ending\r\ndates. In plate 21, _E_, is figured a Period-ending date from Stela 4 at\r\nCopan.[207] In glyphs 1 and 2 appears the date 4 Ahau 13 Yax (compare the\r\nmonth in glyph 2 with fig. 19, _q, r_), which is followed by the ending\r\nsign in 3. This is composed of the hand, a very common \"ending\" element\r\n(see fig. 37, _j, k_) with a grotesque head superfix, also another \"ending\r\nsign\" (see _i, r, u, v_ of the plate just named). In glyph 4 follows the\r\nparticular katun (Katun 15) whose {225} end is here recorded. This date\r\ncorresponds to the Initial Series 9.15.0.0.0 4 Ahau 13 Yax.\r\n\r\nCases where tun endings are recorded are exceedingly rare. The bare\r\nstatement that a certain tun, as Tun 10, for example, had come to its end\r\nleft much to be desired in the way of accuracy, since there was a Tun 10 in\r\nevery katun, and consequently any given tun recurred after an interval of\r\n20 years; in other words, there were three or four different Tun 10's to be\r\ndistinguished from one another in the average lifetime. Indeed, to keep\r\nthem apart at all it was necessary either to add the particular katun in\r\nwhich each fell or to add the date on which each closed. The former was a\r\nstep away from the brevity which probably prompted the use of Period-ending\r\ndating in the first place, and the latter imposed too great a task on the\r\nmemory, that is, keeping in mind the 60 or 70 various tun endings which the\r\naverage lifetime included. For these reasons tun-ending dates occur but\r\nrarely, only when there was little or no doubt concerning the particular\r\nkatun in which they fell.\r\n\r\nIn plate 21, _F_, is figured a tun-ending date from the tablet in the\r\nTemple of the Inscription at Palenque.[208] In glyph 1 appears an ending\r\nsign showing the hand element and the grotesque flattened head (for the\r\nlatter see fig. 37, _i, r, u, v_), both common ending signs. The remaining\r\nelement, another grotesque head with a flaring postfix, is an unusual\r\nvariant of the tun head found only at Palenque (see fig. 29, _h_). The\r\npresence of the tun sign with these two ending signs indicates probably\r\nthat some tun ending follows. Glyphs 2 and 3 record the date 5 Ahau 18\r\nTzec, and glyph 4 records Tun 13. We have here then the record of a Tun 13,\r\nwhich ended on the date 5 Ahau 18 Tzec. But which of the many Tun 13s in\r\nthe Long Count was the one that ended on this particular date? To begin\r\nwith, we are perfectly justified in assuming that this particular tun\r\noccurred somewhere in Cycle 9, but this assumption does not aid us greatly,\r\nsince there were twenty different Tun 13s in Cycle 9, one for each of the\r\ntwenty katuns. However, in the full text of the inscription from which this\r\nexample is taken, 5 Ahau 3 Chen is the date next preceding, and although\r\nthe fact is not recorded, this latter date closed Katun 8 of Cycle 9.\r\nMoreover, shortly after the tun-ending date here under discussion, the date\r\n\"3 Ahau 3 Zotz, end of Katun 9,\" is recorded. It seems likely, therefore,\r\nthat this particular Tun 13, which ended on the date 5 Ahau 18 Tzec, was\r\n9.8.13.0.0 of the Long Count, after 9.8.0.0.0 but before 9.9.0.0.0.\r\nReducing this number to units of the first order, and applying the several\r\nrules given for solving Initial Series, the terminal date of 9.8.13.0.0\r\nwill be found to agree with the terminal date recorded in glyphs 2 and 3,\r\nnamely, 5 Ahau 18 Tzec, {226} and this tun ending corresponded, therefore,\r\nto the Initial Series 9.8.13.0.0 5 Ahau 18 Tzec.\r\n\r\nAnother tun-ending date from Stela 5 at Tikal is figured in plate 21,\r\n_G_.[209] In glyphs 1 and 2 the date 4 Ahau 8 Yaxkin appears, the month\r\nsign being represented as a head variant, which has the essential elements\r\nof the sign for Yaxkin (see fig. 19, _k, l_). Following this in glyph 3 is\r\nTun 13, to which is prefixed the same ending-sign variant as the prefixial\r\nor superfixial elements in figure 37, _i, r, u, v_. We have recorded here\r\nthen \"Tun 13 ending on 4 Ahau 8 Yaxkin,\" though there seems to be no\r\nmention elsewhere in this inscription of the number of the katun in which\r\nthis particular tun fell. By referring to Great Cycle 54 of Goodman's\r\nTables (Goodman, 1897), however, it appears that Tun 13 of Katun 15 of\r\nCycle 9 closed with this date 4 Ahau 8 Yaxkin, and we may assume,\r\ntherefore, that this is the correct position in the Long Count of the\r\ntun-ending date here recorded. This date corresponds to the Initial Series\r\n9.15.13.0.0 4 Ahau 8 Yaxkin.\r\n\r\nThere is a very unusual Period-ending date on the west side of Stela C at\r\nQuirigua[210] (see pl. 21, _H_). In glyphs 1 and 2 appears the number 0\r\nkins, 0 uinals, 5 tuns, and 17 katuns, which we may write 17.5.0.0 and\r\nfollowing this in glyphs 3 and 4 is the date 6 Ahau 13 Kayab. At first\r\nsight this would appear to be a Secondary Series, the number 17.5.0.0 being\r\ncounted forward from some preceding date to reach the date 6 Ahau 13 Kayab\r\nrecorded just after it. The next date preceding this on the west side of\r\nStela C at Quirigua is the Initial-series terminal date 6 Ahau 13 Yaxkin,\r\nillustrated together with its corresponding Initial-series number in figure\r\n68, _A_. However, all attempts to reach the date 6 Ahau 13 Kayab by\r\ncounting either forward or backward the number 17.5.0.0 from the date 6\r\nAhau 13 Yaxkin will prove unsuccessful, and we must seek another\r\nexplanation for the four glyphs here under discussion. If this were a\r\nPeriod-ending date it would mean that Tun 5 of Katun 17 came to an end on\r\nthe date 6 Ahau 13 Kayab. Let us see whether this is true. Assuming that\r\nour cycle coefficient is 9, as we have done in all the other Period-ending\r\ndates presented, we may express glyphs 1 and 2 as the following\r\nInitial-series number, provided they represent a period ending, not a\r\nSecondary-series number: 9.17.5.0.0. Reducing this number to units of the\r\n1st order, and applying the rules previously given for solving Initial\r\nSeries, the terminal date reached will be 6 Ahau 13 Kayab, identical with\r\nthe date recorded in glyphs 3 and 4. We may conclude, therefore, that this\r\nexample records the fact that \"Tun 5 of Katun 17 ended on the date 6 Ahau\r\n13 Kayab,\" this being identical with the Initial Series 9.17.5.0.0 6 Ahau\r\n13 Kayab.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EXAMPLES OF PERIOD-ENDING DATES IN CYCLES OTHER THAN CYCLE\r\n9]\r\n\r\n{227}\r\n\r\nThe foregoing Period-ending dates have all been in Cycle 9, even though\r\nthis fact has not been recorded in any of the above examples. We come next\r\nto the consideration of Period-ending dates which occurred in cycles other\r\nthan Cycle 9.\r\n\r\nIn plate 22, _A_, is figured a Period-ending date from the tablet in the\r\nTemple of the Cross at Palenque.[211] In glyphs 1 and 2 appears the date 4\r\nAhau 8 Cumhu (compare the month form in glyph 2 with fig. 19, _g', h'_),\r\nand in glyph 3 an ending sign (compare glyph 3 with the ending signs in\r\nfig. 37, _l-q_, and with the zero signs in fig. 54). There follows in glyph\r\n4, Cycle 13. These four glyphs record the fact, therefore, that Cycle 13\r\nclosed on the date 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu, the starting point of Maya chronology.\r\nThis same date is again recorded on a round altar at Piedras Negras (see\r\npl. 22, _B_).[212] In glyphs 1 and 2 appears the date 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu, and\r\nin glyph 3a the ending sign, which is identical with the ending sign in the\r\npreceding example, both having the clasped hand, the subfix showing a curl\r\ninfix, and the tassel-like postfix. Compare also figure 37, _l-q_, and\r\nfigure 54. Glyph 3b clearly records Cycle 13. The dates in plate 22, _A,\r\nB_, are therefore identical. In both cases the cycle is expressed by its\r\nnormal form.\r\n\r\nIn plate 22, _C_, is figured a Period-ending date from the tablet in the\r\nTemple of the Foliated Cross at Palenque.[213] In glyph 1 appears an ending\r\nsign in which the hand element and tassel-like postfix show clearly. This\r\nis followed in glyph 2 by Cycle 2, the clasped hand on the head variant\r\nunmistakably indicating the cycle head. Finally, in glyphs 3 and 4 appears\r\nthe date 2 Ahau 3 Uayeb (compare the month form with fig. 19, _i'_).[214]\r\nThe glyphs in plate 22, _C_, record, therefore, the fact that Cycle 2\r\nclosed on the date 2 Ahau 3 Uayeb, a fact which the student may prove for\r\nhimself by converting this Period-ending date into its corresponding\r\nInitial Series and solving the same. Since the end of a cycle is recorded\r\nhere, it is evident that the katun, tun, uinal, and kin coefficients must\r\nall be 0, and our Initial-series number will be, therefore, 2.0.0.0.0.\r\nReducing this to units of the 1st order and proceeding as in the case of\r\nInitial Series, the terminal date reached will be 2 Ahau 3 Uayeb, just as\r\nrecorded in glyphs 3 and 4. The Initial Series corresponding to this\r\nPeriod-ending date will be 2.0.0.0.0 2 Ahau 3 Uayeb.\r\n\r\nThese three Period-ending dates (pl. 22, _A-C_) are not to be considered as\r\nreferring to times contemporaneous with the erection of the monuments upon\r\nwhich they are severally inscribed, since they {228} precede the opening of\r\nCycle 9, the first historic epoch of the Maya civilization, by periods\r\nranging from 2,700 to 3,500 years. As explained elsewhere, they probably\r\nreferred to mythological events. There is a date, however, on a tablet in\r\nthe Temple of the Cross at Palenque which falls in Cycle 8, being fixed\r\ntherein by an adjoining Period-ending date that may have been historical.\r\nThis case is figured in plate 22, _G_.[215] In glyphs 4 and 5 appears the\r\ndate 8 Ahau 13 Ceh (compare the month form in glyph 5 with fig. 16, _u,\r\nv_). This is followed in glyph 6 by a sign which shows the same ending\r\nelement as the forms in figure 37, _i, r, u, v_, and this in turn is\r\nfollowed by Cycle 9 in glyph 7. The date recorded in this case is Cycle 9\r\nending on the date 8 Ahau 13 Ceh, which corresponds to the Initial Series\r\n9.0.0.0.0 8 Ahau 13 Ceh.\r\n\r\nNow, in glyphs 1 and 2 is recorded the date 2 Caban 10 Xul (compare the day\r\nsign with fig. 16, _a', b'_, and the month sign with fig. 19, _i, j_), and\r\nfollowing this date in glyph 3 is the number 3 kins, 6 uinals, or 6.3. This\r\nlooks so much like a Secondary Series that we are justified in treating it\r\nas such until it proves to be otherwise. As the record stands, it seems\r\nprobable that if we count this number 6.3 in glyph 3 forward from the date\r\n2 Caban 10 Xul in glyphs 1 and 2, the terminal date reached will be the\r\ndate recorded in glyphs 4 and 5; that is, the next date following the\r\nnumber. Reducing 6.3 to units of the first order, we have:\r\n\r\n  Glyph 3 = 6 × 20 = 120\r\n  Glyph 3 = 3 ×  1 =   3\r\n                     ---\r\n                     123\r\n\r\nCounting this number forward from 2 Caban 10 Xul according to the rules\r\nwhich apply in such cases, the terminal day reached will be 8 Ahau 13 Ceh,\r\nexactly the date which is recorded in glyphs 4 and 5. But this latter date,\r\nwe have just seen, is declared by the text to have closed Cycle 9, and\r\ntherefore corresponded with the Initial Series 9.0.0.0.0 8 Ahau 13 Ceh.\r\nHence, from this known Initial Series we may calculate the Initial Series\r\nof the date 2 Caban 10 Xul by subtracting from 9.0.0.0.0 the number 6.3, by\r\nwhich the date 2 Caban 10 Xul precedes the date 9.0.0.0.0 8 Ahau 13 Ceh:\r\n\r\n  9. 0. 0. 0. 0     8 Ahau 13 Ceh\r\n           6. 3\r\n  8.19.19.11.17     2 Caban 10 Xul\r\n\r\nThis latter date fell in Cycle 8, as its Initial Series indicates. It is\r\nquite possible, as stated above, that this date may have referred to some\r\nactual historic event in the annals of Palenque, or at least of {229} the\r\nsouthern Maya, though the monument upon which it is recorded probably dates\r\nfrom an epoch at least 200 years later.\r\n\r\nIn a few cases Cycle-10 ending dates have been found. Some of these are\r\nsurely \"contemporaneous,\" that is, the monuments upon which they appear\r\nreally date from Cycle 10, while others are as surely \"prophetic,\" that is,\r\nthe monuments upon which they are found antedate Cycle 10. Examples of both\r\nkinds follow.\r\n\r\nIn plate 22, _E_, is figured a Period-ending date from Stela 8 at\r\nCopan.[216] Glyphs 1 and 2 declare the date 7 Ahau 18 ?, the month sign in\r\nglyph 2 being effaced. In glyph 3 is recorded Cycle 10, the cycle sign\r\nbeing expressed by its corresponding head variant. Note the clasped hand,\r\nthe essential characteristic of the cycle head. Above this appears the same\r\nending sign as that shown in figure 37, _a-h_, and it would seem probable,\r\ntherefore, that these three glyphs record the end of Cycle 10. Let us test\r\nthis by changing the Period-ending date in glyph 3 into its corresponding\r\nInitial-series number and then solving this for the resulting terminal\r\ndate. Since the end of a cycle is here indicated, the katun, tun, uinal,\r\nand kin coefficients must be 0 and the Initial-series number will be,\r\ntherefore, 10.0.0.0.0. Reducing this to units of the first order and\r\napplying the rules indicated in such cases, the resulting terminal date\r\nwill be found to be 7 Ahau 18 Zip. But this agrees exactly with the date\r\nrecorded in glyphs 1 and 2 so far as the latter go, and since the two agree\r\nso far as they go, we may conclude that glyphs 1-3 in plate 22, _E_,\r\nexpress \"Cycle 10 ending on the date 7 Ahau 18 Zip.\" Although this is a\r\ncomparatively late date for Copan, the writer is inclined to believe that\r\nit was \"contemporaneous\" rather than \"prophetic.\"\r\n\r\nThe same can not be said, however, for the Cycle-10 ending date on Zoömorph\r\nG at Quirigua (see pl. 22, _F_). Indeed, this date, as will appear below,\r\nis almost surely \"prophetic\" in character. Glyphs 1 and 2 record the date 7\r\nAhau 18 Zip (compare the month form in glyph 2 with fig. 19, _d_) and glyph\r\n3 shows very clearly \"the end of Cycle 10.\" Compare the ending prefix in\r\nglyph 4 with the same element in fig. 37, _a-h_. Hence we have recorded\r\nhere the fact that \"Cycle 10 ended on the date 7 Ahau 18 Zip,\" a fact\r\nproved also by calculation in connection with the preceding example. Does\r\nthis date represent, therefore, the contemporaneous time of Zoömorph G, the\r\ntime at which it was erected, or at least dedicated? Before answering this\r\nquestion, let us consider the rest of the text from which this example is\r\ntaken. The Initial Series on Zoömorph G at Quirigua has already been shown\r\nin figure 70, and, according to page 187, it records the date 9.17.15.0.0 5\r\nAhau 3 Muan. On the grounds of antecedent probability, we are justified in\r\nassuming at the outset that this date {230} therefore indicates the epoch\r\nor position of Zoömorph G in the Long Count, because it alone appears as an\r\nInitial Series. In the case of all the other monuments at Quirigua,[217]\r\nwhere there is but one Initial Series in the inscription, that Initial\r\nSeries marks the position of the monument in the Long Count. It seems\r\nlikely, therefore, judging from the general practice at Quirigua, that\r\n9.17.15.0.0 5 Ahau 3 Muan was the contemporaneous date of Zoömorph G, not\r\n10.0.0.0.0 7 Ahau 18 Zip, that is, the Initial Series corresponding to the\r\nPeriod-ending date here under discussion (see pl. 22, _F_).[218]\r\n\r\nOther features of this text point to the same conclusion. In addition to\r\nthe Initial Series on this monument there are upward of a dozen\r\nSecondary-series dates, all of which except _one_ lead to 9.17.15.0.0 5\r\nAhau 3 Muan. Moreover, this latter date is recorded thrice in the text, a\r\nfact which points to the conclusion that it was the contemporaneous date of\r\nthis monument.\r\n\r\nThere is still another, perhaps the strongest reason of all, for believing\r\nthat Zoömorph G dates from 9.17.15.0.0 5 Ahau 3 Muan rather than from\r\n10.0.0.0.0 7 Ahau 18 Zip. If assigned to the former date, every hotun from\r\n9.15.15.0.0 9 Ahau 18 Xul to 9.19.0.0.0 9 Ahau 18 Mol has its corresponding\r\nmarker or period-stone at Quirigua, there being not a single break in the\r\nsequence of the fourteen monuments necessary to mark the thirteen hotun\r\nendings between these two dates. If, on the other hand, the date 10.0.0.0.0\r\n7 Ahau 18 Zip is assigned to this monument, the hotun ending 9.17.15.0.0 5\r\nAhau 3 Muan is left without its corresponding monument at this city, as are\r\nalso all the hotuns after 9.19.0.0.0 9 Ahau 18 Mol up to 10.0.0.0.0 7 Ahau\r\n18 Zip, a total of four in all. The perfect sequence of the monuments at\r\nQuirigua developed by regarding Zoömorph G as dating from 9.17.15.0.0 5\r\nAhau 3 Muan, and the very fragmentary sequence which arises if it is\r\nregarded as dating from 10.0.0.0.0 7 Ahau 18 Zip, is of itself practically\r\nsufficient to prove that the former is the correct date, and when taken\r\ninto consideration with the other points above mentioned leaves no room for\r\ndoubt.\r\n\r\nIf this is true, as the writer believes, the date \"Cycle 10 ending on 7\r\nAhau 18 Zip\" on Zoömorph G is \"prophetic\" in character, since it did not\r\noccur until nearly 45 years after the erection of the monument upon which\r\nit was recorded, at which time the city of Quirigua had probably been\r\nabandoned, or at least had lost her prestige.\r\n\r\nAnother Cycle-10 ending date, which differs from the preceding in that it\r\nis almost surely contemporaneous, is that on Stela 11 at Seibal, {231} the\r\nlatest of the great southern sites.[219] This is figured in plate 22, _D_.\r\nGlyphs 1 and 2 show very clearly the date 7 Ahau 18 Zip, and glyph 3\r\ndeclares this to be \"at the end of Cycle 10.\"[220] Compare the ending-sign\r\nsuperfix in glyph 3 with figure 37, _a-h_. This glyph is followed by 1\r\nkatun in 4, which in turn is followed by the date 5 Ahau 3 Kayab in 5 and\r\n6. Finally, glyph 7 declares \"The end of Katun 1.\" Counting forward 1 katun\r\nfrom 10.0.0.0.0 7 Ahau 18 Zip, the date reached will be 5 Ahau 3 Kayab, as\r\nrecorded by 5 and 6, and the Initial Series corresponding to this date will\r\nbe 10.1.0.0.0 5 Ahau 3 Kayab, as declared by glyph 7. See below:\r\n\r\n  10.0.0.0.0    7 Ahau 18 Zip\r\n     1.0.0.0\r\n  10.1.0.0.0    5 Ahau 3 Kayab\r\n  End of Katun 1.\r\n\r\nThis latter date is found also on Stelæ 8, 9, and 10, at the same city.\r\n\r\nAnother Cycle-10 ending date which was probably \"prophetic\", like the one\r\non Zoömorph G at Quirigua, is figured on Altar S at Copan (see fig. 81). In\r\nthe first glyph on the left appears an Initial-series introducing glyph;\r\nthis is followed in glyphs 1-3 by the Initial-series number 9.15.0.0.0,\r\nwhich the student will find leads to the terminal date 4 Ahau 13 Yax\r\nrecorded in glyph 4. This whole Initial Series reads, therefore, 9.15.0.0.0\r\n4 Ahau 13 Yax. In glyph 6a is recorded 5 katuns and in glyph 7 the date 7\r\nAhau 18 Zip, in other words, a Secondary Series.[221] Reducing the number\r\nin glyph 6a to units of the first order, we have:\r\n\r\n            6a = 5 × 7,200 = 36,000\r\n                {0 ×   360 =      0\r\n   Not recorded {0 ×    20 =      0\r\n                {0 ×     1 =      0\r\n                             ------\r\n                             36,000\r\n\r\n{232}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 81. The Initial Series, Secondary Series, and\r\nPeriod-ending date on Altar S, Copan.]\r\n\r\nCounting this number forward from the date 4 Ahau 13 Yax, the terminal date\r\nreached will be found to agree with the date recorded in glyph 7, 7 Ahau 18\r\nZip. But turning to our text again, we find that this date is declared by\r\nglyph 8a to be at the end of Cycle 10. Compare the ending sign, which\r\nappears as the superfix in glyph 8a, with figure 37, _a-h_. Therefore the\r\nSecondary-series date 7 Ahau 18 Zip, there recorded, closed Cycle 10. The\r\nsame fact could have been determined by adding the Secondary-series number\r\nin glyph 6a to the Initial-series number of the starting point 4 Ahau 13\r\nYax in glyphs 1-3:\r\n\r\n  9.15. 0.0.0    4 Ahau 13 Yax\r\n     5.(0.0.0)\r\n  10.0. 0.0.0    7 Ahau 18 Zip\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INITIAL SERIES, SECONDARY SERIES, AND\r\nPERIOD-ENDING DATES ON STELA 3, PIEDRAS NEGRAS]\r\n\r\n{233} The \"end of Cycle 10\" in glyph 8a is merely redundancy. The writer\r\nbelieves that 9.15.0.0.0 4 Ahau 13 Yax indicates the present time of Altar\r\nS rather than 10.0.0.0.0 7 Ahau 18 Zip, and that consequently the latter\r\ndate was \"prophetic\" in character, as was the same date on Zoömorph G at\r\nQuirigua. One reason which renders this probable is that the sculpture on\r\nAltar S very closely resembles the sculpture on Stelæ A and B at Copan,\r\nboth of which date from 9.15.0.0.0 4 Ahau 13 Yax. A possible explanation of\r\nthe record of Cycle 10 on this monument is the following: On the date of\r\nthis monument, 9.15.0.0.0 4 Ahau 13 Yax, just three-fourths of Cycle 9 had\r\nelapsed. This important fact would hardly have escaped the attention of the\r\nold astronomer-priests, and they may have used this monument to point out\r\nthat only a quarter cycle, 5 katuns, was left in Cycle 9. This concludes\r\nthe discussion of Cycle-10 Period-ending dates.\r\n\r\nThe student will note in the preceding example (fig. 81) that\r\nInitial-series, Secondary-series, and Period-ending dating have all been\r\nused together in the same text, glyphs 1-4 recording an Initial-series\r\ndate, glyphs 6a and 7, a Secondary-series date, and glyphs 7 and 8a, a\r\nPeriod-ending date. This practice is not at all unusual in the inscriptions\r\nand several texts illustrating it are figured below.\r\n\r\nTEXTS RECORDING INITIAL SERIES, SECONDARY SERIES, AND PERIOD ENDINGS\r\n\r\nIn plate 23 is shown the inscription on Stela 3 at Piedras Negras. The\r\nintroducing glyph appears in A1 and is followed by the Initial-series\r\nnumber 9.12.2.0.16 in B1-B3. This number reduced to units of the first\r\norder and counted forward from its starting point will be found to reach\r\nthe terminal date 5 Cib 14 Yaxkin, which the student will readily recognize\r\nin A4-B7; the \"month-sign indicator\" appearing very clearly in A7, with the\r\ncoefficient 9 affixed to it. Compare the day sign in A4 with figure 16,\r\n_z_, and the month sign in B7 with figure 19, _k, l_. The Initial Series\r\nrecorded in A1-A4, B7 reads, therefore, 9.12.2.0.16 5 Cib 14 Yaxkin. In C1\r\nD1 is recorded the number 0 kins, 10 uinals, and 12 tuns; that is, 12.10.0,\r\nthe first of several Secondary Series in this text. Reducing this to units\r\nof the first order and counting it forward from the terminal date of the\r\nInitial Series, 5 Cib 14 Yaxkin, the terminal date of the Secondary Series\r\nwill be found to be 1 Cib 14 Kankin, which the student will find recorded\r\nin C2b D2a. The Initial-series value of this latter date may be calculated\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n  9.12. 2. 0.16    5 Cib 14 Yaxkin\r\n       12.10. 0\r\n  9.12.14.10.16    1 Cib 14 Kankin\r\n\r\nFollowing along the text, the next Secondary-series number appears in\r\nD4-C5a and consists of 10 kins,[222] 11 uinals, 1 tun, and 1 katun; that\r\n{234} is, 1.1.11.10. Reducing this number to units of the first order and\r\ncounting it forward from the date next preceding it in the text, that is, 1\r\nCib 14 Kankin in C2b D2a, the new terminal date reached will be 4 Cimi 14\r\nUo, which the student will find recorded in D5-C6. Compare the day sign in\r\nD5 with figure 16, _h, i_, and the month sign in C6 with figure 19, _b, c_.\r\nThe Initial-series value of this new date may be calculated from the known\r\nInitial-series value of the preceding date:\r\n\r\n  9.12.14.10.16    1 Cib 14 Kankin\r\n     1. 1.11.10\r\n  9.13.16. 4. 6    4 Cimi 14 Uo\r\n\r\nThe third Secondary Series appears in E1 and consists of 15 kins,[223] 8\r\nuinals, and 3 tuns, or 3.8.15. Reducing this number to units of the first\r\norder and counting it forward from the date next preceding it in the text,\r\n4 Cimi 14 Uo, in D5-C6, the new terminal date reached will be 11 Imix 14\r\nYax, which the student will find recorded in E2 F2. The day sign in E2\r\nappears, as is very unusual, as a head variant of which only the headdress\r\nseems to show the essential element of the day sign Imix. Compare E2 with\r\nfigure 16, _a, b_, also the month sign in F2 with figure 19, _q, r_. The\r\nInitial Series of this new terminal date may be calculated as above:\r\n\r\n  9.13.16. 4. 6     4 Cimi 14 Uo\r\n        3. 8.15\r\n  9.13.19.13. 1    11 Imix 14 Yax\r\n\r\nThe fourth and last Secondary Series in this text follows in F6 and\r\nconsists of 19 kins and 4 uinals, that is, 4.19. Reducing this number to\r\nunits of the first order and counting it forward from the date next\r\npreceding it in the text, 11 Imix 14 Yax in E2 F2, the new terminal date\r\nreached will be 6 Ahau 13 Muan, which the student will find recorded in\r\nF7-F8. Compare the month sign in F8 with figure 19, _a' b'_. But the glyph\r\nfollowing this date in F9 is very clearly an ending sign; note the hand,\r\ntassel-like postfix, and subfixial element showing the curl infix, all of\r\nwhich are characteristic ending elements (see figs. 37, _l-q_, and 54).\r\nMoreover, in F10 is recorded \"the end of Katun 14.\" Compare the ending\r\nprefix in this glyph with figure 37, _a-h_. This would seem to indicate\r\nthat the date in F7-F8, 6 Ahau 13 Muan, closed Katun 14 of Cycle 9 of the\r\nLong Count. Whether this be true or not may be tested by finding the\r\nInitial-series value corresponding to 6 Ahau 13 Muan, as above:\r\n\r\n  9.13.19.13. 1    11 Imix 14 Yax\r\n           4.19\r\n  9.14. 0. 0. 0     6 Ahau 13 Muan\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INITIAL SERIES, SECONDARY SERIES, AND\r\nPERIOD-ENDING DATES ON STELA E (WEST SIDE), QUIRIGUA]\r\n\r\n{235} This shows that the date 6 Ahau 13 Muan closed Katun 14, as glyphs\r\nF9-F10 declare. This may also be verified by changing \"the end of Katun 14\"\r\nrecorded in F9-F10 into its corresponding Initial-series value, 9.14.0.0.0,\r\nand solving for the terminal date. The day reached by these calculations\r\nwill be 6 Ahau 13 Muan, as above. This text, in so far as it has been\r\ndeciphered, therefore reads:\r\n\r\n  9.12. 2. 0.16      5 Cib 14 Yaxkin    A1-A4, B7\r\n       12.10. 0                         C1 D1\r\n  9.12.14.10.16      1 Cib 14 Kankin    C2b D2a\r\n     1. 1.11.10                         D4-C5a\r\n  9.13.16. 4. 6      4 Cimi 14 Uo       D5-C6\r\n        3. 8.15                         E1\r\n  9.13.19.13. 1      11 Imix 14 Yax     E2 F2\r\n           4.19                         F6\r\n  9.14. 0. 0. 0      6 Ahau 13 Muan     F7-F8\r\n  End of Katun 14                       F9-F10\r\n\r\nThe inscription just deciphered is worthy of special note for several\r\nreasons. In the first place, all its dates and numbers are not only\r\nexceedingly clear, thus facilitating their identification, but also\r\nunusually regular, the numbers being counted forward from the dates next\r\npreceding them to reach the dates next following them in every case; all\r\nthese features make this text particularly well adapted for study by the\r\nbeginner. In the second place, this inscription shows the three principal\r\nmethods employed by the Maya in recording dates, that is, Initial-series\r\ndating, Secondary-series dating, and Period-ending dating, all combined in\r\nthe same text, the example of each one being, moreover, unusually good.\r\nFinally, the Initial Series of this inscription records identically the\r\nsame date as Stela 1 at Piedras Negras, namely, 9.12.2.0.16 5 Cib 14\r\nYaxkin. Compare plate 23 with plate 17. Indeed, these two monuments, Stelæ\r\n1 and 3, stand in front of the same building. All things considered, the\r\ninscription on Stela 3 at Piedras Negras is one of the most satisfactory\r\ntexts that has been found in the whole Maya territory.\r\n\r\nAnother example showing the use of these three methods of dating in one and\r\nthe same text is the inscription on Stela E at Quirigua, illustrated in\r\nplate 24 and figure 82.[224] This text begins with the Initial Series on\r\nthe west side. The introducing glyph appears in A1-B3 and is followed by\r\nthe Initial-series number 9.14.13[225].4.17 in A4-A6. Reducing this number\r\nto units of the first order, remembering the correction in the tun\r\ncoefficient in A5 noted below, and applying the rules previously given for\r\nsolving Initial Series, the terminal date {236} reached will be 12 Caban 5\r\nKayab. This the student will readily recognize in B6-B8b, the form in B8a\r\nbeing the \"month sign indicator,\" here shown with a head-variant\r\ncoefficient 10. Compare B6 with figure 16, _a', b'_, and B8b with figure\r\n19, _d'-f'_. This Initial Series therefore should read as follows:\r\n9.14.13.4.17 12 Caban 5 Kayab. Following down the text, there is reached in\r\nB10b-A11a, a Secondary-series number consisting of 3 kins, 13 uinals, and 6\r\ntuns, that is, 6.13.3. Counting this number forward from the date next\r\npreceding it in the text, 12 Caban 5 Kayab, the date reached will be 4 Ahau\r\n13 Yax, which the student will find recorded in B11. Compare the month form\r\nin B11b with figure 19, _q, r_. But since the Initial-series value of 12\r\nCaban 5 Kayab is known, the Initial-series value of 4 Ahau 13 Yax may be\r\ncalculated from it as follows:\r\n\r\n  9.14.13. 4.17    12 Caban 5 Kayab\r\n        6.13. 3\r\n  9.15. 0. 0. 0    4 Ahau 13 Yax\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 82. The Initial Series on Stela E (east side),\r\nQuirigua.]\r\n\r\nThe next Secondary-series number appears in B12, plate 24, _B_, and\r\nconsists of 6 kins, 14 uinals, and 1 tun, that is, 1.14.6.[226] The student\r\nwill find that all efforts to reach the next date recorded in the text, 6\r\nCimi 4 Tzec in A13b B13a, by counting forward 1.14.6 from 4 Ahau 13 Yax in\r\nB11, the date next preceding this number, will prove unsuccessful. However,\r\nby counting _backward_ 1.14.6 from 6 Cimi 4 Tzec, he will find the date\r\nfrom which the count proceeds is 10 Ahau 8 Chen, though this latter date is\r\nnowhere recorded in this text. We have seen elsewhere, on Stela F for\r\nexample (pl. 19, _A, B_), that the date 6 Cimi 4 Tzec corresponded to the\r\nInitial-series number 9.15.6.14.6; consequently, we may calculate the\r\nposition of the unrecorded {237} date 10 Ahau 8 Chen in the Long Count from\r\nthis known Initial Series, by subtracting[227] 1.14.6 from it:\r\n\r\n  9.15.6.14.6    6 Cimi 4 Tzec\r\n       1.14.6\r\n  9.15.5. 0.0    10 Ahau 8 Chen\r\n\r\nWe now see that there are 5 tuns, that is, 1 hotun, not recorded here,\r\nnamely, the hotun from 9.15.0.0.0 4 Ahau 13 Yax, to 9.15.5.0.0 10 Ahau 8\r\nChen, and further, that the Secondary-series number 1.14.6 in B12 is\r\ncounted from the unexpressed date 10 Ahau 8 Chen to reach the terminal date\r\n6 Cimi 4 Tzec recorded in A13b B13a.\r\n\r\nThe next Secondary-series number appears in A14b B14 and consists of 15\r\nkins, 16 uinals, 1 tun, and 1 katun, that is, 1.1.16.15. As in the\r\npreceding case, however, all efforts to reach the date following this\r\nnumber, 11 Imix 19 Muan in A15b B15a, by counting it forward from 6 Cimi 4\r\nTzec, the date next preceding it in the text, will prove unavailing. As\r\nbefore, it is necessary to count it _backward_ from 11 Imix 19 Muan to\r\ndetermine the starting point. Performing this operation, the starting point\r\nwill be found to be the date 7 Cimi 9 Zotz. Since neither of these two\r\ndates, 11 Imix 19 Muan and 7 Cimi 9 Zotz, occurs elsewhere at Quirigua, we\r\nmust leave their corresponding Initial-series values indeterminate for the\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nThe last Secondary Series in this text is recorded in A17b B17a and\r\nconsists of 19 kins,[228] 4 uinals, and 8 tuns. Reducing this number to\r\nunits of the first order and counting it forward from the date next\r\npreceding it in the text, 11 Imix 19 Muan in A15b B15a, the terminal date\r\nreached will be 13 Ahau 18 Cumhu, which the student will find recorded in\r\nA18. Compare the month sign with figure 19, _g', h'_. But immediately\r\nfollowing this date in B18a is Katun 17 and in the upper part of B18b the\r\nhand-denoting ending. These glyphs A18 and B18 would seem to indicate,\r\ntherefore, that Katun 17 came to an end on the date 13 Ahau 18 Cumhu. That\r\nthey do, may be proved beyond all doubt by changing this period ending into\r\nits corresponding Initial-series number 9.17.0.0.0 and solving for the\r\nterminal date. This will be found to be 13 Ahau 18 Cumhu, which is recorded\r\nin A18. This latter date, therefore, had the following position in the Long\r\nCount: 9.17.0.0.0 13 Ahau 18 Cumhu. But having determined the position of\r\nthis latter date in the Long Count, that is, its Initial-series value, it\r\nis now possible to fix the positions of the two dates 11 Imix 19 Muan and 7\r\nCimi 9 Zotz, which we were obliged to leave indeterminate above. Since the\r\ndate 13 Ahau 18 Cumhu was derived {238} by counting forward 8.4.19 from 11\r\nImix 19 Muan, the Initial-series value of the latter may be calculated by\r\nsubtracting 8.4.19 from the Initial-series value of the former:\r\n\r\n  9.17. 0. 0. 0   13 Ahau 18 Cumhu\r\n        8. 4.19\r\n  9.16.11.13. 1   11 Imix 19 Muan\r\n\r\nAnd since the date 11 Imix 19 Muan was reached by counting forward\r\n1.1.16.15 from 7 Cimi 9 Zotz, the Initial-series value of the latter may be\r\ncalculated by subtracting 1.1.16.15 from the now known Initial-series value\r\nof the former:\r\n\r\n  9.16.11.13. 1    11 Imix 19 Muan\r\n     1. 1.16.15\r\n  9.15. 9.14. 6     7 Cimi 9 Zotz\r\n\r\nAlthough this latter date is not recorded in the text, the date next\r\npreceding the number 1.1.16.15 is 6 Cimi 4 Tzec, which corresponded to the\r\nInitial Series 9.15.6.14.6 6 Cimi 4 Tzec, as we have seen, a date which was\r\nexactly 3 tuns earlier than 7 Cimi 9 Zotz, 9.15.9.14.6 - 9.15.6.14.6 =\r\n3.0.0.\r\n\r\nThe inscription on the west side closes then in A18 B18 with the record\r\nthat Katun 17 ended on the date 13 Ahau 18 Cumhu. The inscription on the\r\neast side of this same monument opens with this same date expressed as an\r\nInitial Series, 9.17.0.0.0 13 Ahau 18 Cumhu. See figure 82, A1-A6, A7,[229]\r\nand A10.\r\n\r\nThe reiteration of this date as an Initial Series, when its position in the\r\nLong Count had been fixed unmistakably on the other side of the same\r\nmonument by its record as a Period-ending date, together with the fact that\r\nit is the latest date recorded in this inscription, very clearly indicates\r\nthat it alone designated the contemporaneous time of Stela E, and hence\r\ndetermines the fact that Stela E was a hotun-marker.

This date would almost\r\ncertainly seem, therefore, to indicate some very important event in the\r\nannals of Quirigua. Moreover, since it is the earliest date found at this\r\ncity which can reasonably be regarded as having occurred during the actual\r\noccupancy of the site, it is not improbable that it may represent, as\r\nexplained elsewhere, the time at which Quirigua was founded.[232] It is\r\nnecessary, however, to {240} caution the student that the above explanation\r\nof the date 9.14.13.4.17 12 Caban 5 Kayab, or indeed any other for that\r\nmatter, is in the present state of our knowledge entirely a matter of\r\nconjecture.\r\n\r\nPassing on, it will be seen from Table XVII that two of the monuments,\r\nnamely, Stelæ E and F, bear the date 9.15.0.0.0 4 Ahau 3 Yax, and two\r\nothers, Stelæ E and J, the date 9.15.5.0.0 10 Ahau 8 Chen, one hotun later.\r\nAll four come together again, however, with the date 9.15.6.14.6 6 Cimi 4\r\nTzec, which is recorded on each. This date, like 9.14.13.4.17 12 Caban 5\r\nKayab, designates probably another important event in Quirigua history, the\r\nnature of which, however, again escapes us. After the date 9.15.6.14.6 6\r\nCimi 4 Tzec, these monuments show no further correspondences, and we may\r\npass over the intervening time to their respective closing dates with but\r\nscant notice, with the exception of Zoömorph G, which records a half dozen\r\ndates in the hotun that it marks, 9.17.15.0.0 5 Ahau 3 Muan. (These latter\r\nare omitted from Table XVII.)\r\n\r\nThis concludes the presentation of Initial-series, Secondary-series, and\r\nPeriod-ending, dating, with which the student should be sufficiently\r\nfamiliar by this time to continue his researches independently.\r\n\r\nIt was explained (see p. 76) that, when a Secondary-series date could not\r\nbe referred ultimately to either an Initial-series date or a Period-ending\r\ndate, its position in the Long Count could not be determined with\r\ncertainty, and furthermore that such a date became merely one of the 18,980\r\ndates of the Calendar Round and could be fixed only within a period of 52\r\nyears. A few examples of Calendar-round dating are given in figure 83 and\r\nplate 25. In figure 83, A, is shown a part of the inscription on Altar M at\r\nQuirigua.[233] In A1 B1 appears a number consisting of 0 kins, 2 uinals,\r\nand 3 tuns, that is, 3.2.0, and following this in A2b B2, the date 4 Ahau\r\n13 Yax, and in A3b B3 the date 6 Ahau 18 Zac. Compare the month glyphs in\r\nB2 and B3 with _q_ and _r_, and _s_ and _t_, respectively, of figure 19.\r\nThis has every appearance of being a Secondary Series, one of the two dates\r\nbeing the starting point of the number 3.2.0, and the other its terminal\r\ndate. Reducing 3.2.0 to units of the first order, we have:\r\n\r\n  B1 = 3 × 360 = 1,080\r\n  A1 = 2 ×  20 =    40\r\n  A1 = 0 ×   1 =     0\r\n                 -----\r\n                 1,120\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CALENDAR-ROUND DATES ON ALTAR 5, TIKAL]\r\n\r\n{241}\r\n\r\nCounting this number forward from 4 Ahau 13 Yax, the nearest date to it in\r\nthe text, the terminal date reached will be found to be 6 Ahau 18 Zac, the\r\ndate which, we have seen, was recorded in A3b B3. It is clear, therefore,\r\nthat this text records the fact that 3.2.0 has been counted forward from\r\nthe date 4 Ahau 13 Yax and the date 6 Ahau 18 Zac has been reached, but\r\nthere is nothing given by means of which the position of either of these\r\ndates in the Long Count can be determined; consequently either of these\r\ndates will be found recurring like any other Calendar-round date, at\r\nintervals of every 52 years. In such cases the first assumption to be made\r\nis that one of the dates recorded the close of a hotun, or at least of a\r\ntun, in Cycle 9 of the Long Count. The reasons for this assumption are\r\nquite obvious.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 83. Calendar-round dates: _A_, Altar M, Quirigua; _B_,\r\nAltar Z, Copan.]\r\n\r\nThe overwhelming majority of Maya dates fall in Cycle 9, and nearly all\r\ninscriptions have at least one date which closed some hotun or tun of that\r\ncycle. Referring to Goodman's Tables, in which the tun endings of Cycle 9\r\nare given, the student will find that the date 4 Ahau 13 Yax occurred as a\r\ntun ending in Cycle 9, at 9.15.0.0.0 4 Ahau 13 Yax, in which position it\r\nclosed not only a hotun but also a katun. Hence, it is probable, although\r\nthe fact is not actually recorded, that the Initial-series value of the\r\ndate 4 Ahau 13 Yax in this text is 9.15.0.0.0 4 Ahau 13 Yax, and if this is\r\nso the Initial-series value of the date 6 Ahau 18 Zac will be:\r\n\r\n  9.15.0.0.0     4 Ahau 13 Yax\r\n       3.2.0\r\n  9.15.3.2.0     6 Ahau 18 Zac\r\n\r\n{242} In the case of this particular text the Initial-series value\r\n9.15.0.0.0 might have been assigned to the date 4 Ahau 13 Yax on the ground\r\nthat this Initial-series value appears on two other monuments at Quirigua,\r\nnamely, Stelæ E and F, with this same date.\r\n\r\nIn figure 83, _B_, is shown a part of the inscription from Altar Z at\r\nCopan.[234] In A1 B1 appears a number consisting of 1 kin, 8 uinals, and 1\r\ntun, that is, 1.8.1, and following this in B2-A3 is the date 13 Ahau 18\r\nCumhu, but no record of its position in the Long Count. If 13 Ahau 18 Cumhu\r\nis the terminal date of the number 1.8.1, the starting point can be\r\ncalculated by counting this number backward, giving the date 12 Cauac 2\r\nZac. On the other hand, if 13 Ahau 18 Cumhu is the starting point, the\r\nterminal date reached by counting 1.8.1 forward will be 1 Imix 9 Mol.\r\nHowever, since an ending prefix appears just before the date 13 Ahau 18\r\nCumhu in A2 (compare fig. 37, _a-h_), and since another, though it must be\r\nadmitted a very unusual ending sign, appears just after this date in A3\r\n(compare the prefix of B3 with the prefix of fig. 37, _o_, and the subfix\r\nwith the subfixes of _l-n_ and _q_ of the same figure), it seems probable\r\nthat 13 Ahau 18 Cumhu is the terminal date and also a Period-ending date.\r\nReferring to Goodman's Tables, it will be found that the only tun in Cycle\r\n9 which ended with the date 13 Ahau 18 Cumhu was 9.17.0.0.0 13 Ahau 18\r\nCumhu, which not only ended a hotun but a katun as well.[235] If this is\r\ntrue, the unrecorded starting point 12 Cauac 2 Zac can be shown to have the\r\nfollowing Initial-series value:\r\n\r\n  9.17. 0.0. 0    13 Ahau 18 Cumhu\r\n        1.8. 1    Backward\r\n  9.16.18.9.19    12 Cauac 2 Zac\r\n\r\nIn each of the above examples, as we have seen, there was a date which\r\nended one of the katuns of Cycle 9, although this fact was not recorded in\r\nconnection with either. Because of this fact, however, we were able to date\r\nboth of these monuments with a degree of probability amounting almost to\r\ncertainty. In some texts the student will find that the dates recorded did\r\nnot end any katun, hotun, or even tun, in Cycle 9, or in any other cycle,\r\nand consequently such dates can not be assigned to their proper positions\r\nin the Long Count by the above method.\r\n\r\nThe inscription from Altar 5 at Tikal figured in plate 25 is a case in\r\npoint. This text opens with the date 1 Muluc 2 Muan in glyphs 1 and 2 (the\r\nfirst glyph or starting point is indicated by the star). {243} Compare\r\nglyph 1 with figure 16, _m_, _n_, and glyph 2 with figure 19, _a', b'_. In\r\nglyphs 8 and 9 appears a Secondary-series number consisting of 18 kins, 11\r\nuinals, and 11 tuns (11.11.18). Reducing this number to units of the first\r\norder and counting it forward from the date next preceding it in the text,\r\n1 Muluc 2 Muan in glyphs 1 and 2, the terminal date reached will be 13\r\nManik 0 Xul, which the student will find recorded in glyphs 10 and 11.\r\nCompare glyph 10 with figure 16, _j_, and glyph 11 with figure 19, _i, j_.\r\nThe next Secondary-series number appears in glyphs 22 and 23, and consists\r\nof 19 kins, 9 uinals, and 8 tuns (8.9.19). Reducing this to units of the\r\nfirst order and counting forward from the date next preceding it in the\r\ntext, 13 Manik 0 Xul in glyphs 10 and 11, the terminal date reached will be\r\n11 Cimi 19 Mac, which the student will find recorded in glyphs 24 and 25.\r\nCompare glyph 24 with figure 16, _h, i_, and glyph 25 with figure 19, _w_,\r\n_x_. Although no number appears in glyph 26, there follows in glyphs 27 and\r\n28 the date 1 Muluc 2 Kankin, which the student will find is just three\r\ndays later than 11 Cimi 19 Mac, that is, one day 12 Manik 0 Kankin, two\r\ndays 13 Lamat 1 Kankin, and three days 1 Muluc 2 Kankin.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fact that all these numbers are counted regularly from the\r\ndates next preceding them to reach the dates next following them, there is\r\napparently no glyph in this text which will fix the position of any one of\r\nthe above dates in the Long Count. Moreover, since none of the day parts\r\nshow the day sign Ahau, it is evident that none of these dates can end any\r\nuinal, tun, katun, or cycle in the Long Count, hence their positions can\r\nnot be determined by the method used in fixing the dates in figure 83, _A_\r\nand _B_.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, another method by means of which Calendar-round dates\r\nmay sometimes be referred to their proper positions in the Long Count. A\r\nmonument which shows only Calendar-round dates may be associated with\r\nanother monument or a building, the dates of which are fixed in the Long\r\nCount. In such cases the fixed dates usually will show the positions to\r\nwhich the Calendar-round dates are to be referred.\r\n\r\nTaking any one of the dates given on Altar 5 in plate 25, as the last, 1\r\nMuluc 2 Kankin, for example, the positions at which this date occurred in\r\nCycle 9 may be determined from Goodman's Tables to be as follows:\r\n\r\n  9. 0.16. 5.9      1 Muluc 2 Kankin\r\n  9. 3. 9. 0.9      1 Muluc 2 Kankin\r\n  9. 6. 1.13.9      1 Muluc 2 Kankin\r\n  9. 8.14. 8.9      1 Muluc 2 Kankin\r\n  9.11. 7. 3.9      1 Muluc 2 Kankin\r\n  9.13.19.16.9      1 Muluc 2 Kankin\r\n  9.16.12.11.9      1 Muluc 2 Kankin\r\n  9.19. 5. 6.9      1 Muluc 2 Kankin\r\n\r\n{244} Next let us ascertain whether or not Altar 5 was associated with any\r\nother monument or building at Tikal, the date of which is fixed\r\nunmistakably in the Long Count. Says Mr. Teobert Maler, the discoverer of\r\nthis monument:[236] \"A little to the north, fronting the north side of this\r\nsecond temple and very near it, is a masonry quadrangle once, no doubt,\r\ncontaining small chambers and having an entrance to the south. In the\r\nmiddle of this quadrangle stands Stela 16 in all its glory, still unharmed,\r\n_and in front of it, deeply buried in the earth, we found Circular Altar\r\n5_, which was destined to become so widely renowned.\" It is evident from\r\nthe foregoing that the altar we are considering here, called by Mr. Maler\r\n\"Circular Altar 5,\" was found in connection with another monument at Tikal,\r\nnamely, Stela 16. But the date on this latter monument has already been\r\ndeciphered as \"6 Ahau 13 Muan ending Katun 14\" (see pl. 21, _D_; also p.\r\n224), and this date, as we have seen, corresponded to the Initial Series\r\n9.14.0.0.0 6 Ahau 13 Muan.\r\n\r\nOur next step is to ascertain whether or not any of the Initial-series\r\nvalues determined above as belonging to the date 1 Muluc 2 Kankin on Altar\r\n5 are near the Initial Series 9.14.0.0.0 6 Ahau 13 Muan, which is the\r\nInitial-series date corresponding to the Period-ending date on Stela 16. By\r\ncomparing 9.14.0.0.0 with the Initial-series values of 1 Muluc 2 Kankin\r\ngiven above the student will find that the fifth value, 9.13.19.16.9,\r\ncorresponds with a date 1 Muluc 2 Kankin, which was only 31 days (1 uinal\r\nand 11 kins) earlier than 9.14.0.0.0 6 Ahau 13 Muan. Consequently it may be\r\nconcluded that 9.13.19.16.9 was the particular day 1 Muluc 2 Kankin which\r\nthe ancient scribes had in mind when they engraved this text. From this\r\nknown Initial-series value the Initial-series values of the other dates on\r\nAltar 5 may be obtained by calculation. The texts on Altar 5 and Stela 16\r\nare given below to show their close connection:\r\n\r\n                      _Altar 5_\r\n\r\n  9.12.19.12. 9      1 Muluc 2 Muan    glyphs 1 and 2\r\n       11.11.18                        glyphs 8 and 9\r\n  9.13.11. 6. 7     13 Manik 0 Xul     glyphs 10 and 11\r\n        8. 9.19                        glyphs 22 and 23\r\n  9.13.19.16. 6     11 Cimi 19 Mac     glyphs 24 and 25\r\n             (3)       undeclared\r\n  9.13.19.16. 9     1 Muluc 2 Kankin   glyphs 27 and 28\r\n          (1.11)   (Time between the two monuments, 31 days.)\r\n\r\n                      _Stela 16_\r\n\r\n  9.14.0.0.0        6 Ahau 13 Muan      A1-A4\r\n\r\nSometimes, however, monuments showing Calendar-round dates stand {245}\r\nalone, and in such cases it is almost impossible to fix their dates in the\r\nLong Count. At Yaxchilan in particular Calendar-round dating seems to have\r\nbeen extensively employed, and for this reason less progress has been made\r\nthere than elsewhere in deciphering the inscriptions.\r\n\r\nERRORS IN THE ORIGINALS\r\n\r\nBefore closing the presentation of the subject of the Maya inscriptions the\r\nwriter has thought it best to insert a few texts which show actual errors\r\nin the originals, mistakes due to the carelessness or oversight of the\r\nancient scribes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 84. Texts showing actual errors in the originals: _A_,\r\nLintel, Yaxchilan; _B_, Altar Q, Copan; _C_, Stela 23, Naranjo.]\r\n\r\nErrors in the original texts may be divided into two general classes: (1)\r\nThose which are revealed by inspection, and (2) those which do not appear\r\nuntil after the indicated calculations have been made and the results fail\r\nto agree with the glyphs recorded.\r\n\r\nAn example of the first class is illustrated in figure 84, _A_. A very\r\ncursory inspection of this text--an Initial Series from a lintel at\r\nYaxchilan--will show that the uinal coefficient in C1 represents an\r\nimpossible condition from the Maya point of view. This glyph as it stands\r\n{246} unmistakably records 19 uinals, a number which had no existence in\r\nthe Maya system of numeration, since 19 uinals are always recorded as 1 tun\r\nand 1 uinal.[237] Therefore the coefficient in C1 is incorrect on its face,\r\na fact we have been able to determine before proceeding with the\r\ncalculation indicated. If not 19, what then was the coefficient the ancient\r\nscribe should have engraved in its place? Fortunately the rest of this text\r\nis unusually clear, the Initial-series number 9.15.6.?.1 appearing in\r\nB1-D1, and the terminal date which it reaches, 7 Imix 19 Zip, appearing in\r\nC2 D2. Compare C2 with figure 16, _a, b_, and D2 with figure 19, d. We know\r\nto begin with that the uinal coefficient must be one of the eighteen\r\nnumerals 0 to 17, inclusive. Trying 0 first, the number will be 9.15.6.0.1,\r\nwhich the student will find leads to the date 7 Imix 4 Chen. Our first\r\ntrial, therefore, has proved unsuccessful, since the date recorded is 7\r\nImix 19 Zip. The day parts agree, but the month parts are not the same.\r\nThis month part 4 Chen is useful, however, for one thing, it shows us how\r\nfar distant we are from the month part 19 Zip, which is recorded. It\r\nappears from Table XV that in counting forward from position 4 Chen just\r\n260 days are required to reach position 19 Zip. Consequently, our first\r\ntrial number 9.15.6.0.1 falls short of the number necessary by just 260\r\ndays. But 260 days are equal to 13 uinals; therefore we must increase\r\n9.15.6.0.1 by 13 uinals. This gives us the number 9.15.6.13.1. Reducing\r\nthis to units of the first order and solving for the terminal date, the\r\ndate reached will be 7 Imix 19 Zip, which agrees with the date recorded, in\r\nC2 D2. We may conclude, therefore, that the uinal coefficient in C1 should\r\nhave been 13, instead of 19 as recorded.\r\n\r\nAnother error of the same kind--that is, one which may be detected by\r\ninspection--is shown in figure 84, _B_. Passing over glyphs 1, 2, and 3, we\r\nreach in glyph 4 the date 5 Kan 13 Uo. Compare the upper half of 4 with\r\nfigure 16, _f_, and the lower half with figure 19, _b, c_. The coefficient\r\nof the month sign is very clearly 13, which represents an impossible\r\ncondition when used to indicate the position of a day whose name is Kan;\r\nfor, according to Table VII, the only positions which the day Kan can ever\r\noccupy in any division of the year are 2, 7, 12, and 17. Hence, it is\r\nevident that we have detected an error in this text before proceeding with\r\nthe calculations indicated. Let us endeavor to ascertain the coefficient\r\nwhich should have been used with the month sign in glyph 4 instead of the\r\n13 actually recorded. These glyphs present seemingly a regular Secondary\r\nSeries, the starting point being given in 1 and 2, the number in 3, and the\r\nterminal date in 4. Counting this number 3.4 forward from the starting\r\npoint, 6 Ahau 13 Kayab, the terminal date reached will be 5 Kan 12 Uo.\r\nComparing this with the terminal date actually recorded, we find that the\r\ntwo agree except for the month coefficient. But since the date recorded\r\nrepresents an impossible condition, as we {247} have shown, we are\r\njustified in assuming that the month coefficient which should have been\r\nused in glyph 4 was 12, instead of 13. In other words, the craftsman to\r\nwhom the sculpturing of this inscription was intrusted engraved here 3 dots\r\ninstead of 2 dots, and 1 ornamental crescent, which, together with the 2\r\nbars present, would have given the month coefficient determined by\r\ncalculation, 12. An error of this kind might occur very easily and indeed\r\nin many cases may be apparent rather than real, being due to weathering\r\nrather than to a mistake in the original text.\r\n\r\nSome errors in the inscriptions, however, can not be detected by\r\ninspection, and develop only after the calculations indicated have been\r\nperformed, and the results are found to disagree with the glyphs recorded.\r\nErrors of this kind constitute the second class mentioned above. A case in\r\npoint is the Initial Series on the west side of Stela E at Quirigua,\r\nfigured in plate 24, _A_. In this text the Initial-series number recorded\r\nin A4-A6 is very clearly 9.14.12.4.17, and the terminal date in B6-B8b is\r\nequally clearly 12 Caban 5 Kayab. Now, if this number 9.14.12.4.17 is\r\nreduced to units of the first order and is counted forward from the same\r\nstarting point as practically all other Initial Series, the terminal date\r\nreached will be 3 Caban 10 Kayab, not 12 Caban 5 Kayab, as recorded.\r\nMoreover, if the same number is counted forward from the date 4 Ahau 8\r\nZotz, which may have been another starting point for Initial Series, as we\r\nhave seen, the terminal date reached will be 3 Caban 10 Zip, not 12 Caban 5\r\nKayab, as recorded. The inference is obvious, therefore, that there is some\r\nerror in this text, since the number recorded can not be made to reach the\r\ndate recorded. An error of this kind is difficult to detect, because there\r\nis no indication in the text as to which glyph is the one at fault. The\r\nfirst assumption the writer makes in such cases is that the date is correct\r\nand that the error is in one of the period-glyph coefficients. Referring to\r\nGoodman's Table, it will be found that the date 12 Caban 5 Kayab occurred\r\nat the following positions in Cycle 9 of the Long Count:\r\n\r\n  9. 1. 9.11.17      12 Caban 5 Kayab\r\n  9. 4. 2. 6.17      12 Caban 5 Kayab\r\n  9. 6.15. 1.17      12 Caban 5 Kayab\r\n  9. 9. 7.14.17      12 Caban 5 Kayab\r\n  9.12. 0. 9.17      12 Caban 5 Kayab\r\n  9.14.13. 4.17      12 Caban 5 Kayab\r\n  9.17. 5.17.17      12 Caban 5 Kayab\r\n  9.19.18.12.17      12 Caban 5 Kayab\r\n\r\nAn examination of these values will show that the sixth in the list,\r\n9.14.13.4.17, is very close to the number recorded in our text,\r\n9.14.12.4.17. Indeed, the only difference between the two is that the\r\nformer has 13 tuns while the latter has only 12. The similarity between\r\nthese two numbers is otherwise so close and the error in this {248} event\r\nwould be so slight--the record of 2 dots and 1 ornamental crescent instead\r\nof 3 dots--that the conclusion is almost inevitable that the error here is\r\nin the tun coefficient, 12 having been recorded instead of 13. In this\r\nparticular case the Secondary Series and the Period-ending date, which\r\nfollow the Initial-series number 9.14.12.4.17, prove that the above reading\r\nof 13 tuns for the 12 actually recorded is the one correction needed to\r\nrectify the error in this text.\r\n\r\nAnother example indicating an error which can not be detected by inspection\r\nis shown in figure 84, _C_. In glyphs 1 and 2 appears the date 8 Eznab 16\r\nUo (compare glyph 1 with fig. 16, _c'_, and glyph 2 with fig. 19, _b, c_).\r\nIn glyph 3 follows a number consisting of 17 kins and 4 uinals (4.17).\r\nFinally, in glyphs 4 and 5 is recorded the date 2 Men 13 Yaxkin (compare\r\nglyph 4 with fig. 16, _y_, and glyph 5 with fig. 19, _k, l_). This has\r\nevery appearance of being a Secondary Series, of which 8 Eznab 16 Uo is the\r\nstarting point, 4.17, the number to be counted, and 2 Men 13 Yaxkin the\r\nterminal date. Reducing 4.17 to units of the first order and counting it\r\nforward from the starting point indicated, the terminal date reached will\r\nbe 1 Men 13 Yaxkin. This differs from the terminal date recorded in glyphs\r\n4 and 5 in having a day coefficient of 1 instead of 2. Since this involves\r\nbut a very slight change in the original text, we are probably justified in\r\nassuming; that the day coefficient in glyph 4 should have been 1 instead of\r\n2 as recorded.\r\n\r\nOne more example will suffice to show the kind of errors usually\r\nencountered in the inscriptions. In plate 26 is figured the Initial Series\r\nfrom Stela N at Copan. The introducing glyph appears in A1 and is followed\r\nby the Initial-series number 9.16.10.0.0 in A2-A6, all the coefficients of\r\nwhich are unusually clear. Reducing this to units of the first order and\r\nsolving for the terminal date, the date reached will be 1 Ahau 3 Zip. This\r\nagrees with the terminal date recorded in A7-A15 except for the month\r\ncoefficient, which is 8 in the text instead of 3, as determined by\r\ncalculation. Assuming that the date recorded is correct and that the error\r\nis in the coefficient of the period glyphs the next step is to find the\r\npositions in Cycle 9 at which the date 1 Ahau 8 Zip occurred. Referring to\r\nGoodman's Tables, these will be found to be:\r\n\r\n  9. 0. 8.11.0      1 Ahau 8 Zip\r\n  9. 3. 1. 6.0      1 Ahau 8 Zip\r\n  9. 5.14. 1.0      1 Ahau 8 Zip\r\n  9. 8. 6.14.0      1 Ahau 8 Zip\r\n  9.10.19. 9.0      1 Ahau 8 Zip\r\n  9.13.12. 4.0      1 Ahau 8 Zip\r\n  9.16. 4.17.0      1 Ahau 8 Zip\r\n  9.18.17.12.0      1 Ahau 8 Zip\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INITIAL SERIES ON STELA N, COPAN, SHOWING ERROR\r\nIN MONTH COEFFICIENT]\r\n\r\n{249} The number in the above list coming nearest to the number recorded in\r\nthis text (9.16.10.0.0) is the next to the last, 9.16.4.17.0. But in order\r\nto reach this value of the date 1 Ahau 8 Zip (9.16.4.17.0) with the number\r\nactually recorded, two considerable changes in it are first necessary, (1)\r\nreplacing the 10 tuns in A4 by 4 tuns, that is, changing 2 bars to 4 dots,\r\nand (2) replacing 0 uinals in A5 by 17 uinals, that is, changing the 0 sign\r\nto 3 bars and 2 dots. But these changes involve a very considerable\r\nalteration of the original, and it seems highly improbable, therefore, that\r\nthe date here _intended_ was 9.16.4.17.0 1 Ahau 8 Zip. Moreover, as any\r\nother number in the above list involves at least three changes of the\r\nnumber recorded in order to reach 1 Ahau 8 Zip, we are forced to the\r\nconclusion that the error must be in the terminal date, not in one of the\r\ncoefficients of the period glyphs. Let us therefore assume in our next\r\ntrial that the Initial-series number is correct as it stands, and that the\r\nerror lies somewhere in the terminal date. But the terminal date reached in\r\ncounting 9.16.10.0.0 forward in the Long Count will be 1 Ahau 3 Zip, as we\r\nhave seen on the preceding page, and this date differs from the terminal\r\ndate recorded by 5--1 bar in the month coefficient. It would seem probable,\r\ntherefore, that the bar to the left of the month sign in A15 should have\r\nbeen omitted, in which case the text would correctly record the date\r\n9.16.10.0.0 1 Ahau 3 Zip.\r\n\r\nThe student will note that in all the examples above given the errors have\r\nbeen in the numerical coefficients, and not in the signs to which they are\r\nattached; in other words, that although the numerals are sometimes\r\nincorrectly recorded, the period, day, and month glyphs never are.\r\n\r\nThroughout the inscriptions, the exceptions to this rule are so very rare\r\nthat the beginner is strongly advised to disregard them altogether, and to\r\nassume when he finds an incorrect text that the error is in one of the\r\nnumerical coefficients. It should be remembered also in this connection\r\nthat errors in the inscriptions are exceedingly rare, and a glyph must not\r\nbe condemned as incorrect until every effort has been made to explain it in\r\nsome other way.\r\n\r\nThis concludes the presentation of texts from the inscriptions. The student\r\nwill have noted in the foregoing examples, as was stated in Chapter II,\r\nthat practically the only advances made looking toward the decipherment of\r\nthe glyphs have been on the chronological side. It is now generally\r\nadmitted that the relative ages[238] of most Maya monuments can be\r\ndetermined from the dates recorded upon them, and that the final date in\r\nalmost every inscription indicates the time at or near which the monument\r\nbearing it was erected, or at least formally dedicated. The writer has\r\nendeavored to show, moreover, {250} that many, if indeed not most, of the\r\nmonuments, were \"time markers\" or \"period stones,\" in every way similar to\r\nthe \"period stones\" which the northern Maya are known to[239] have erected\r\nat regularly recurring periods. That the period which was used as this\r\nchronological unit may have varied in different localities and at different\r\nepochs is not at all improbable. The northern Maya at the time of the\r\nSpanish Conquest erected a \"period stone\" every katun, while the evidence\r\npresented in the foregoing texts, particularly those from Quirigua and\r\nCopan, indicates that the chronological unit in these two cities at least\r\nwas the hotun, or quarter-katun period. Whatever may have been the\r\nchronological unit used, the writer believes that the best explanation for\r\nthe monuments found so abundantly in the Maya area is that they were\r\n\"period stones,\" erected to commemorate or mark the close of successive\r\nperiods.\r\n\r\nThat we have succeeded in deciphering, up to the present time, only the\r\ncalendric parts of the inscriptions, the chronological skeleton of Maya\r\nhistory as it were, stripped of the events which would vitalize it, should\r\nnot discourage the student nor lead him to minimize the importance of that\r\nwhich is already gained. Thirty years ago the Maya inscriptions were a\r\nsealed book, yet to-day we read in the glyphic writing the rise and fall of\r\nthe several cities in relation to one another, and follow the course of\r\nMaya development even though we can not yet fill in the accompanying\r\nbackground. Future researches, we may hope, will reconstruct this\r\nbackground from the undeciphered glyphs, and will reveal the events of Maya\r\nhistory which alone can give the corresponding chronology a human interest.\r\n{251}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE CODICES\r\n\r\nThe present chapter will treat of the application of the material presented\r\nin Chapters III and IV to texts drawn from the codices, or hieroglyphic\r\nmanuscripts; and since these deal in great part with the tonalamatl, or\r\nsacred year of 260 days, as we have seen (p. 31), this subject will be\r\ntaken up first.\r\n\r\nTEXTS RECORDING TONALAMATLS\r\n\r\nThe _tonalamatl_, or 260-day period, as represented in the codices is\r\nusually divided into five parts of 52 days each, although tonalamatls of\r\nfour parts, each containing 65 days, and tonalamatls of ten parts, each\r\ncontaining 26 days, are not at all uncommon. These divisions are further\r\nsubdivided, usually into unequal parts, all the divisions in one\r\ntonalamatl, however, having subdivisions of the same length.\r\n\r\nSo far as its calendric side is concerned,[240] the tonalamatl may be\r\nconsidered as having three essential parts, as follows:\r\n\r\n1. A column of day signs.\r\n\r\n2. Red numbers, which are the coefficients of the day signs.\r\n\r\n3. Black numbers, which show the distances between the days designated by\r\n(1) and (2).\r\n\r\nThe number of the day signs in (1), usually 4, 5, or 10, shows the number\r\nof parts into which the tonalamatl is divided. Every red number in (2) is\r\nused _once_ with every day sign in (1) to designate a day which is reached\r\nin counting one of the black numbers in (3) forward from another of the\r\ndays recorded by (1) and (2). The most important point for the student to\r\ngrasp in studying the Maya tonalamatl is the fundamental difference between\r\nthe use of the red numbers and the black numbers. The former are used only\r\nas day coefficients, and together with the day signs show the days which\r\nbegin the divisions and subdivisions of the tonalamatl. The black numbers,\r\non the other hand, are exclusively _time counters_, which show only the\r\ndistances between the dates indicated by the day signs and their\r\ncorresponding coefficients among the red numbers. They show in effect the\r\nlengths of the periods and subperiods into which the tonalamatl is divided.\r\n{252}\r\n\r\nMost of the numbers, that is (2) and (3), in the tonalamatl are presented\r\nin a horizontal row across the page or pages[241] of the manuscript, the\r\nred alternating with the black. In some instances, however, the numbers\r\nappear in a vertical column or pair of columns, though in this case also\r\nthe same alternation in color is to be observed. More rarely the numbers\r\nare scattered over the page indiscriminately, seemingly without fixed order\r\nor arrangement.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed in each of the tonalamatls given in the following\r\nexamples that the record is greatly abbreviated or skeletonized. In the\r\nfirst place, we see no month signs, and consequently the days recorded are\r\nnot shown to have had any fixed positions in the year. Furthermore, since\r\nthe year positions of the days are not fixed, any day could recur at\r\nintervals of every 260 days, or, in other words, any tonalamatl with the\r\ndivisions peculiar to it could be used in endless repetition throughout\r\ntime, commencing anew every 260 days, regardless of the positions of these\r\ndays in succeeding years. Nor is this omission the only abbreviation\r\nnoticed in the presentation of the tonalamatl. Although every tonalamatl\r\ncontained 260 days, only the days commencing its divisions and subdivisions\r\nappear in the record; and even these are represented in an abbreviated\r\nform. For example, instead of repeating the numerical coefficients with\r\neach of the day signs in (1), the coefficient was written once above the\r\ncolumn of day signs, and in this position was regarded as belonging to each\r\nof the different day signs in turn. It follows from this fact that all the\r\nmain divisions of the tonalamatl begin with days the coefficients of which\r\nare the same. Concerning the beginning days of the subdivisions, a still\r\ngreater abbreviation is to be noted. The day signs are not shown at all,\r\nand only their numerical coefficients appear in the record. The economy of\r\nspace resulting from the above abbreviations in writing the days will\r\nappear very clearly in the texts to follow.\r\n\r\nIn reading tonalamatls the first point to be determined is the name of the\r\nday with which the tonalamatl began. This will be found thus:\r\n\r\n_Rule 1._ To find the beginning day of a tonalamatl, prefix the first red\r\nnumber, which will usually be found immediately above the column of the day\r\nsigns, to the uppermost[242] day sign in the column.\r\n\r\nFrom this day as a starting point, the first black number in the text is to\r\nbe counted forward; and _the coefficient_ of the day reached will be the\r\nsecond red number in the text. As stated above, the _day signs_ of the\r\nbeginning days of the subdivisions are always omitted. From the second red\r\nnumber, which, as we have seen, is the {253} coefficient of the beginning\r\nday of the second _subdivision_ of the first division, the _second black\r\nnumber_ is to be counted forward in order to reach the third red number,\r\nwhich is the coefficient of the day beginning the _third subdivision_ of\r\nthe first division. This operation is continued until the last black number\r\nhas been counted forward from the red number just preceding it and the last\r\nred number has been reached.\r\n\r\nThis last red number will be found to be the same as the first red number,\r\nand the day which the count will have reached will be shown by the first\r\nred number (or the last, since the two are identical) used with the _second\r\nday sign_ in the column. And this latter day will be the beginning day of\r\nthe _second division_ of the tonalamatl. From this day the count proceeds\r\nas before. The black numbers are added to the red numbers immediately\r\npreceding them in each case, until the last red number is reached, which,\r\ntogether with _the third day sign_ in the column, forms the beginning day\r\nof _the third division_ of the tonalamatl. After this operation has been\r\nrepeated until the last red number in the last division of the tonalamatl\r\nhas been reached--that is, the 260th day--the count will be found to have\r\nreentered itself, or in other words, the day reached by counting forward\r\nthe last black number of the last division will be the same as the\r\nbeginning day of the tonalamatl.\r\n\r\nIt follows from the foregoing that the sum of all the black numbers\r\nmultiplied by the number of day signs in the column--the number of main\r\ndivisions in the tonalamatl--will equal exactly 260. If any tonalamatl\r\nfails to give 260 as the result of this test, it may be regarded as\r\nincorrect or irregular.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing material may be reduced to the following:\r\n\r\n_Rule 2._ To find the coefficients of the beginning days of succeeding\r\ndivisions and subdivisions of the tonalamatl, add the black numbers to the\r\nred numbers immediately preceding them in each case, and, after subtracting\r\nall the multiples of 13 possible, the resulting number will be the\r\ncoefficient of the beginning day desired.\r\n\r\n_Rule 3._ To find the day signs of the beginning days of the succeeding\r\ndivisions and subdivisions of the tonalamatl, count forward in Table I the\r\nblack number from the day sign of the beginning day of the preceding\r\ndivision or subdivision, and the day name reached in Table I will be the\r\nday sign desired. If it is at the beginning of one of the _main divisions_\r\nof the tonalamatl, the day sign reached will be found to be recorded in the\r\ncolumn of day signs, but if at the beginning of a _subdivision_ it will be\r\nunexpressed.\r\n\r\nTo these the test rule above given may be added:\r\n\r\n_Rule 4._ The sum of all the black numbers multiplied by the number of day\r\nsigns in the column of day signs will equal exactly 260 if the tonalamatl\r\nis perfectly regular and correct. {254}\r\n\r\nIn plate 27 is figured page 12 of the Dresden Codex. It will be noted that\r\nthis page is divided into three parts by red division lines; after the\r\ngeneral practice these have been designated _a, b_, and _c, a_ being\r\napplied to the upper part, _b_ to the middle part, and _c_ to the lower\r\npart. Thus \"Dresden 12b\" designates the middle part of page 12 of the\r\nDresden Codex, and \"Dresden 15c\" the lower part of page 15 of the same\r\nmanuscript. Some of the pages of the codices are divided into four parts,\r\nor again, into two, and some are not divided at all. The same description\r\napplies in all cases, the parts being lettered from top to bottom in the\r\nsame manner throughout.\r\n\r\nThe first tonalamatl presented will be that shown in Dresden 12b (see the\r\nmiddle division in pl. 27). The student will readily recognize the three\r\nessential parts mentioned on page 251: (1) The column of day signs, (2) the\r\nred numbers, and (3) the black numbers. Since there are five day signs in\r\nthe column at the left of the page, it is evident that this tonalamatl has\r\nfive main divisions. The first point to establish is the day with which\r\nthis tonalamatl commenced. According to rule 1 (p. 252) this will be found\r\nby prefixing the first red number to the topmost day sign in the column.\r\nThe first red number in Dresden 12b stands in the regular position (above\r\nthe column of day signs), and is very clearly 1, that is, one red dot. A\r\ncomparison of the topmost day sign in this column with the forms of the day\r\nsigns in figure 17 will show that the day sign here recorded is Ix (see\r\nfig. 17, _t_), and the opening day of this tonalamatl will be, therefore, 1\r\nIx. The next step is to find the beginning days of the succeeding\r\nsubdivisions of the first main division of the tonalamatl, which, as we\r\nhave just seen, commenced with the day 1 Ix. According to rule 2 (p. 253),\r\nthe first black number--in this case 13, just to the right of and slightly\r\nbelow the day sign Ix--is to be added to the red number immediately\r\npreceding it--in this case 1--in order to give the coefficient of the day\r\nbeginning the next subdivision, all 13s possible being first deducted from\r\nthe resulting number. Furthermore, this coefficient will be the red number\r\nnext following the black number.\r\n\r\nApplying this rule to the present case, we have:\r\n\r\n1 (first red number) + 13 (next black number) = 14. Deducting all the 13s\r\npossible, we have left 1 (14 - 13) as the coefficient of the day beginning\r\nthe next subdivision of the tonalamatl. This number 1 will be found as the\r\nred number immediately following the first black number, 13. To find the\r\ncorresponding day sign, we must turn to rule 3 (p. 253) and count forward\r\nin Table I this same black number, 13, from the preceding day sign, in this\r\ncase Ix. The day sign reached will be Manik. But since this day begins only\r\na _subdivision_ in this tonalamatl, not one of the _main divisions_, its\r\nday sign will not be recorded, and we have, therefore, the day 1 Manik, of\r\nwhich the 1 is expressed by the second red number and the name part Manik\r\nonly indicated by the calculations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PAGE 12 OF THE DRESDEN CODEX, SHOWING TONALAMATLS IN\r\nALL THREE DIVISIONS]\r\n\r\n{255}\r\n\r\nThe beginning day of the next subdivision of the tonalamatl may now be\r\ncalculated from the day 1 Manik by means of rules 2 and 3 (p. 253). Before\r\nproceeding with the calculation incident to this step it will be necessary\r\nfirst to examine the next black number in our tonalamatl. This will be\r\nfound to be composed of this sign () to which 6 (1 bar and 1 dot) has been\r\naffixed. It was explained on page 92 that in representing tonalamatls the\r\nMaya had to have a sign which by itself would signify the number 20, since\r\nnumeration by position was impossible. This special character for the\r\nnumber 20 was given in figure 45, and a comparison of it with the sign here\r\nunder discussion will show that the two are identical. But in the present\r\nexample the number 6 is attached to this sign thus: (), and the whole\r\nnumber is to be read 20 + 6 = 26. This number, as we have seen in Chapter\r\nIV, would ordinarily have been written thus (): 1 unit of the second order\r\n(20 units of the first order) + 6 units of the first order = 26. As\r\nexplained on page 92, however, numeration by position--that is, columns of\r\nunits--was impossible in the tonalamatls, in which many of the numbers\r\nappear in a horizontal row, consequently some character had to be devised\r\nwhich by itself would stand for the number 20.\r\n\r\nReturning to our text, we find that the \"next black number\" is 26 (20 + 6),\r\nand this is to be added to the red number 1 next preceding it, which, as we\r\nhave seen, is an abbreviation for the day 1 Manik (see rule 2, p. 253).\r\nAdding 26 to 1 gives 27, and deducting all the 13s possible, namely, two,\r\nwe have left 1 (27 - 26); this number 1, which is the coefficient of the\r\nbeginning day of the next _subdivision_, will be found recorded just to the\r\nright of the black 26.\r\n\r\nThe day sign corresponding to this coefficient 1 will be found by counting\r\nforward 26 in Table I from the day name Manik. This will give the day name\r\nBen, and 1 Ben will be, therefore, the beginning day of the next\r\nsubdivision (the third subdivision of the first main division).\r\n\r\nThe next black number in our text is 13, and proceeding as before, this is\r\nto be added to the red number next preceding it, 1, the abbreviation for 1\r\nBen. Adding 13 to 1 we have 14, and deducting all the 23s possible, we\r\nobtain 1 again (14 - 13), which is recorded just to the right of the black\r\n13 (rule 2, p. 253).[243] Counting forward 13 in Table I from the day name\r\nBen, the day name reached will be Cimi, and the day 1 Cimi will be the\r\nbeginning day of the next part of the tonalamatl. But since 13 is the last\r\nblack number, we should have reached in 1 Cimi the beginning day of the\r\n_second main division_ of {256} the tonalamatl (see p. 253), and this is\r\nfound to be the case, since the day sign Cimi is _the second_ in the column\r\nof day signs to the left. Compare this form with figure 17, _i, j_. The day\r\nrecorded is therefore 1 Cimi.\r\n\r\nThe first division of the tonalamatl under discussion is subdivided,\r\ntherefore, into three parts, the first part commencing with the day 1 Ix,\r\ncontaining 13 days; the second commencing with the day 1 Manik, containing\r\n26 days; and the third commencing with the day 1 Ben, containing 13 days.\r\n\r\nThe second division of the tonalamatl commences with the day 1 Cimi, as we\r\nhave seen above, and adding to this the first black number, 13, as before,\r\naccording to rules 2 and 3 (p. 253), the beginning day of the next\r\nsubdivision will be found to be 1 Cauac. Of this, however, only the 1 is\r\ndeclared (see to the right of the black 13). Adding the next black number,\r\n26, to this day, according to the above rules the beginning day of the next\r\nsubdivision will be found to be 1 Chicchan. Of this, however, the 1 again\r\nis the only part declared. Adding the next and last black number, 13, to\r\nthis day, 1 Chicchan, according to the rules just mentioned the beginning\r\nday of the next, or third, main division will be found to be 1 Eznab.\r\nCompare the third day sign in the column of day signs with the form for\r\nEznab in figure 17, _z, a'_. The second division of this tonalamatl\r\ncontains, therefore, three parts: The first, commencing with the day 1\r\nCimi, containing 13 days; the second, commencing with the day 1 Cauac,\r\ncontaining 26 days; and the third, commencing with the day 1 Chicchan,\r\ncontaining 13 days.\r\n\r\nSimilarly the third division, commencing with the day 1 Eznab, could be\r\nshown to have three parts, of 13, 26, and 13 days each, commencing with the\r\nday 1 Eznab, 1 Chuen, and 1 Caban, respectively. It could be shown, also,\r\nthat the fourth division commenced with the day 1 Oc (compare the fourth\r\nsign in the column of day signs with figure 17, _o_), and, further, that it\r\nhad three subdivisions containing 13, 26, and 13 days each, commencing with\r\nthe days 1 Oc, 1 Akbal, and 1 Muluc, respectively. Finally, the fifth and\r\nlast division of the tonalamatl will commence with the day 1 Ik. Compare\r\nthe last day sign in the column of day signs with figure 17, _c, d_; and\r\nits three subdivisions of 13, 26, and 13 days each with the days 1 Ik, 1\r\nMen, and 1 Imix, respectively. The student will note also that when the\r\nlast black number, 13, has been added to the beginning day of the _last\r\nsubdivision_ of the _last division_, the day reached will be 1 Ix, the day\r\nwith which the tonalamatl commenced. This period is continuous, therefore,\r\nreentering itself immediately on its conclusion and commencing anew. {257}\r\n\r\nThere follows below an outline[244] of this particular tonalamatl:\r\n\r\n  ---------------------+---------+-----------+---------+---------+---------\r\n                       |1st      |2d         |3d       |4th      |5th\r\n                       |Division |Division   |Division |Division |Division\r\n  ---------------------+---------+-----------+---------+---------+---------\r\n  1st part, 13 days,   |         |           |         |         |\r\n  beginning with day   |1 Ix     |1 Cimi     |1 Eznab  |1 Oc     |1 Ik\r\n                       |         |           |         |         |\r\n  2d part, 26 days,    |         |           |         |         |\r\n  beginning with day   |1 Manik  |1 Cauac    |1 Chuen  |1 Akbal  |1 Men\r\n                       |         |           |         |         |\r\n  3d part, 13 days,    |         |           |         |         |\r\n  beginning with day   |1 Ben    |1 Chicchan |1 Caban  |1 Muluc  |1 Imix\r\n                       |         |           |         |         |\r\n  Total number of days |52       |52         |52       |52       |52\r\n  ---------------------+---------+-----------+---------+---------+---------\r\n\r\nNext tonalamatl: 1st Division, 1st part, 13 days, beginning with the day 1\r\nIx, etc.\r\n\r\nWe may now apply rule 4 (p. 253) as a test to this tonalamatl. Multiplying\r\nthe sum of all the black numbers, 13 + 26 + 13 = 52, by the number of day\r\nsigns in the column of day signs, 5, we obtain 260 (52 × 5), which proves\r\nthat this tonalamatl is regular and correct.\r\n\r\nThe student will note in the middle division of plate 27 that the pictures\r\nare so arranged that one picture stands under the first subdivisions of all\r\nthe divisions, the second picture under the second subdivisions, and the\r\nthird under the third subdivisions. It has been conjectured that these\r\npictures represent the gods who were the patrons or guardians of the\r\nsubdivisions of the tonalamatls, under which each appears. In the present\r\ncase the first god pictured is the Death Deity, God A (see fig. 3). Note\r\nthe fleshless lower jaw, the truncated nose, and the vertebræ. The second\r\ndeity is unknown, but the third is again the Death God, having the same\r\ncharacteristics as the god in the first picture. The cloak worn by this\r\ndeity in the third picture shows the crossbones, which would seem to have\r\nbeen an emblem of death among the Maya as among us. The glyphs above these\r\npictures probably explain the nature of the periods to which they refer, or\r\nperhaps the ceremonies peculiar or appropriate to them. In many cases the\r\nname glyphs of the deities who appear below them are given; for example, in\r\nthe present text, the second and sixth glyphs in the upper row[245] record\r\nin each case the fact that the Death God is figured below.\r\n\r\nThe glyphs above the pictures offer one of the most promising problems in\r\nthe Maya field. It seems probable, as just explained, that the four or six\r\nglyphs which stand above each of the pictures in a tonalamatl tell the\r\nmeaning of the picture to which they are appended, and any advances made,\r\nlooking toward their deciphering, will lead to far-reaching results in the\r\nmeaning of the {258} nonnumerical and noncalendric signs. In part at least\r\nthey show the name glyphs of the gods above which they occur, and it seems\r\nnot unlikely that the remaining glyphs may refer to the actions of the\r\ndeities who are portrayed; that is, to the ceremonies in which they are\r\nengaged. More extended researches along this line, however, must be made\r\nbefore this question can be answered.\r\n\r\nThe next tonalamatl to be examined is that shown in the lower division of\r\nplate 27, Dresden 12c. At first sight this would appear to be another\r\ntonalamatl of five divisions, like the preceding one, but a closer\r\nexamination reveals the fact that the last day sign in the column of day\r\nsigns is like the first, and that consequently there are only four\r\ndifferent signs denoting four divisions. The last, or fifth sign, like the\r\nlast red number to which it corresponds, merely indicates that after the\r\n260th day the tonalamatl reenters itself and commences anew.\r\n\r\nPrefixing the first red number, 13, to the first day sign, Chuen (see fig.\r\n17, _p, q_), according to rule 1 (p. 252), the beginning day of the\r\ntonalamatl will be found to be 13 Chuen. Adding to this the first black\r\nnumber, 26, according to rules 2 and 3 (p. 253), the beginning day of the\r\nnext subdivision will be found to be 13 Caban. Since this day begins only a\r\nsubdivision of the tonalamatl, however, its name part Caban is omitted, and\r\nmerely the coefficient 13 recorded. Commencing with the day 13 Caban and\r\nadding to it the next black number in the text, again 26, according to\r\nrules 2 and 3 (p. 253), the beginning day of the next subdivision will be\r\nfound to be 13 Akbal, represented by its coefficient 13 only. Adding the\r\nlast black number in the text, 13, to 13 Akbal, according to the rules just\r\nmentioned, the beginning day of the next part of the tonalamatl will be\r\nfound to be 13 Cib. And since the black 13 which gave this new day is the\r\nlast black number in the text, the new day 13 Cib will be the beginning day\r\nof the next or _second division_ of the tonalamatl, and it will be recorded\r\nas the second sign in the column of day signs. Compare the second day sign\r\nin the column of day signs with figure 17, _v, w_.\r\n\r\nFollowing the above rules, the student will have no difficulty in working\r\nout the beginning days of the remaining divisions and subdivisions of this\r\ntonalamatl. These are given below, though the student is urged to work them\r\nout independently, using the following outline simply as a check on his\r\nwork. Adding the last black number, 13, to the beginning day of the last\r\nsubdivision of the last division, 13 Eznab, will bring the count back to\r\nthe day 13 Chuen with which the tonalamatl began: {259}\r\n\r\n  ---------------------+----------+---------+----------+----------\r\n                       |1st       |2d       |3d        |4th\r\n                       |Division  |Division |Division  |Division\r\n  ---------------------+----------+---------+----------+----------\r\n  1st part, 26 days,   |          |         |          |\r\n  beginning with day   |13 Chuen  |13 Cib   |13 Imix   |13 Cimi\r\n                       |          |         |          |\r\n  2d part, 26 days,    |          |         |          |\r\n  beginning with day   |13 Caban  |13 Ik    |13 Manik  |13 Eb\r\n                       |          |         |          |\r\n  3d part, 13 days,    |          |         |          |\r\n  beginning with day   |13 Akbal  |13 Lamat |13 Ben    |13 Eznab\r\n                       |          |         |          |\r\n  Total number of days |65        |65       |65        |65\r\n  ---------------------+----------+---------+----------+----------\r\n\r\nNext tonalamatl: 1st division, 1st part, 26 days, beginning with the day 13\r\nChuen, etc.\r\n\r\nApplying the test rule to this tonalamatl (see rule 4, p. 253), we have: 26\r\n+ 26 + 13 = 65, the sum of the black numbers, and 4 the number of the day\r\nsigns in the column of day signs,[246] 65 × 4 = 260, the exact number of\r\ndays in a tonalamatl.\r\n\r\nThe next tonalamatl (see the upper part of pl. 27, that is, Dresden 12a)\r\noccupies only the latter two-thirds of the upper division, the black 12 and\r\nred 11 being the last black and red numbers, respectively, of another\r\ntonalamatl.\r\n\r\nThe presence of 10 day signs arranged in two parallel columns of five each\r\nwould seem at first to indicate that this is a tonalamatl of 10 divisions,\r\nbut it develops from the calculations that instead there are recorded here\r\ntwo tonalamatls of five divisions each, the first column of day signs\r\ndesignating one tonalamatl and the second another quite distinct therefrom.\r\n\r\nThe first red numeral is somewhat effaced, indeed all the red has\r\ndisappeared and only the black outline of the glyph remains. Its position,\r\nhowever, above the column of day signs, seems to indicate its color and\r\nuse, and we are reasonably safe in stating that the first of the two\r\ntonalamatls here recorded began with the day 8 Ahau. Adding to this the\r\nfirst black number, 27, the beginning day of the next subdivision will be\r\nfound to be 9 Manik, neither the coefficient nor day sign of which appears\r\nin the text. Assuming that the calculation is correct, however, and adding\r\nthe next black number, 25 (also out of place), to this day, 9 Manik, the\r\nbeginning day of the next part will be 8 Eb. But since 25 is the last black\r\nnumber, 8 Eb will be the beginning day of the next main division and should\r\nappear as the second sign in the first column of day signs. Comparison of\r\nthis form with figure 17, _r_, will show that Eb is recorded in this place.\r\n{260} In this manner all of the beginning days could be worked out as\r\nbelow:\r\n\r\n  ---------------------+----------+---------+----------+----------+--------\r\n                       |1st       |2d       |3d        |4th       |5th\r\n                       |Division  |Division |Division  |Division  |Division\r\n  ---------------------+----------+---------+----------+----------+--------\r\n  1st part, 27 days,   |          |         |          |          |\r\n  beginning with day   |8 Ahau    |8 Eb     |8 Kan     |8 Cib     |8 Lamat\r\n                       |          |         |          |          |\r\n  2d part, 25 days,    |          |         |          |          |\r\n  beginning with day   |9 Manik   |9 Cauac  |9 Chuen   |9 Akbal   |9 Men\r\n                       |          |         |          |          |\r\n  Total number of days |52        |52       |52        |52        |52\r\n  ---------------------+----------+---------+----------+----------+--------\r\n\r\nThe application of rule 4 (p. 253) to this tonalamatl gives: 5 × 52 = 260,\r\nthe exact number of days in a tonalamatl. As previously explained, the\r\nsecond column of day signs belongs to another tonalamatl, which, however,\r\nutilized the same red 8 as the first and the same black 27 and 25 as the\r\nfirst. The outline of this tonalamatl, which began with the day 8 Oc,\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  ---------------------+----------+---------+---------+---------+----------\r\n                       |1st       |2d       |3d       |4th      |5th\r\n                       |Division  |Division |Division |Division |Division\r\n  ---------------------+----------+---------+---------+---------+----------\r\n  1st part, 27 days,   |          |         |         |         |\r\n  beginning with day   |8 Oc      |8 Ik     |8 Ix     |8 Cimi   |8 Eznab\r\n                       |          |         |         |         |\r\n  2d part, 25 days,    |          |         |         |         |\r\n  beginning with day   |9 Caban   |9 Muluc  |9 Imix   |9 Ben    |9 Chicchan\r\n                       |          |         |         |         |\r\n  Total number of days |52        |52       |52       |52       |52\r\n  ---------------------+----------+---------+---------+---------+----------\r\n\r\nThe application of rule 4 (p. 253) to this tonalamatl gives: 5 × 52 = 260,\r\nthe exact number of days in a tonalamatl. It is interesting to note that\r\nthe above tonalamatl, beginning with the day 8 Oc, commenced just 130 days\r\nlater than the first tonalamatl, which began with the day 8 Ahau. In other\r\nwords, the first of the two tonalamatls in Dresden 12a was just half\r\ncompleted when the second one commenced, and the second half of the first\r\ntonalamatl began with the same day as the first half of the second\r\ntonalamatl, and vice versa.\r\n\r\nThe tonalamatl in plate 28, upper division, is from Dresden 15a, and is\r\ninteresting because it illustrates how certain missing parts may be filled\r\nin. The first red number is missing and we can only say that this\r\ntonalamatl began with some day Ahau. However, adding the first black\r\nnumber, 34, to this day ? Ahau, the day reached will be 13 Ix, of which\r\nonly 13 is recorded. Since 13 Ix was reached by counting 34 forward from\r\nthe day with which the count must have started, by counting back 34 from 13\r\nIx the starting point will be found to be 5 Ahau, and we may supply a red\r\nbar above the column of the day signs. Adding the next black number, 18, to\r\nthis day 13 Ix, the beginning day of the next _division_ will be found to\r\nbe 5 Eb, which appears as the second day sign in the column of day signs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PAGE 15 OF THE DRESDEN CODEX, SHOWING TONALAMATLS IN\r\nALL THREE DIVISIONS]\r\n\r\n{261}\r\n\r\nThe last red number is 5, thus establishing as correct our restoration of a\r\nred 5 above the column of day signs. From here this tonalamatl presents no\r\nunusual features and it may be worked as follows:\r\n\r\n  ---------------------+----------+---------+----------+----------+--------\r\n                       |1st       |2d       |3d        |4th       |5th\r\n                       |Division  |Division |Division  |Division  |Division\r\n  ---------------------+----------+---------+----------+----------+--------\r\n  1st part, 34 days,   |          |         |          |          |\r\n  beginning with day   |5 Ahau    |5 Eb     |5 Kan     |5 Cib     |5 Lamat\r\n                       |          |         |          |          |\r\n  2d part, 18 days,    |          |         |          |          |\r\n  beginning with day   |13 Ix     |13 Cimi  |13 Eznab  |13 Oc     |13 Ik\r\n                       |          |         |          |          |\r\n  Total number of days |52        |52       |52        |52        |52\r\n  ---------------------+----------+---------+----------+----------+--------\r\n\r\nApplying rule 4 (p. 253), we have: 5 × 52 = 260, the exact number of days\r\nin a tonalamatl. The next tonalamatl (see lower part of pl. 28, that is,\r\nDresden 15c) has 10 day signs arranged in two parallel columns of 5 each.\r\nThis, at its face value, would seem to be divided into 10 divisions, and\r\nthe calculations confirm the results of the preliminary inspection.\r\n\r\nThe tonalamatl opens with the day 3 Lamat. Adding to this the first black\r\nnumber, 12, the day reached will be 2 Ahau, of which only the 2 is recorded\r\nhere. Adding to 2 Ahau the next black number, 14, the day reached will be 3\r\nIx. And since 14 is the last black number, this new day will be the\r\nbeginning of the next division in the tonalamatl and will appear as the\r\nupper day sign in the second column.[247] Commencing with 3 Ix and adding\r\nto it the first black number 12, the day reached will be 2 Cimi, and adding\r\nto this the next black number, 14, the day reached will be 3 Ahau, which\r\nappears as the second glyph in the first column. This same operation if\r\ncarried throughout will give the following outline of this tonalamatl:\r\n\r\n  ---------------------+----------+---------+----------+----------+--------\r\n                       |1st       |2d       |3d        |4th       |5th\r\n                       |Division  |Division |Division  |Division  |Division\r\n  ---------------------+----------+---------+----------+----------+--------\r\n  1st part, 12 days,   |          |         |          |          |\r\n  beginning with day   |3 Lamat   |3 Ix     |3 Ahau    |3 Cimi    |3 Eb\r\n                       |          |         |          |          |\r\n  2d part, 14 days,    |          |         |          |          |\r\n  beginning with day   |2 Ahau    |2 Cimi   |2 Eb      |2 Eznab   |2 Kan\r\n                       |          |         |          |          |\r\n  Total number of days |26        |26       |26        |26        |26\r\n  ---------------------+----------+---------+----------+----------+--------\r\n\r\n{262} (Concluded)\r\n\r\n  ---------------------+----------+---------+----------+----------+--------\r\n                       |6th       |7th      |8th       |9th       |10th\r\n                       |Division  |Division |Division  |Division  |Division\r\n  ---------------------+----------+---------+----------+----------+--------\r\n  1st part, 12 days,   |          |         |          |          |\r\n  beginning with day   |3 Eznab   |3 Kan    |3 Oc      |3 Cib     |3 Ik\r\n                       |          |         |          |          |\r\n  2d part, 14 days,    |          |         |          |          |\r\n  beginning with day   |2 Oc      |2 Cib    |2 Ik      |2 Lamat   |2 Ix\r\n                       |          |         |          |          |\r\n  Total number of days |26        |26       |26        |26        |26\r\n  ---------------------+----------+---------+----------+----------+--------\r\n\r\nApplying rule 4 (p. 253) to this tonalamatl, we have: 10 × 26 = 260, the\r\nexact number of days in a tonalamatl.\r\n\r\nThe tonalamatl which appears in the middle part on plate 28--that is,\r\nDresden 15b--extends over on page 16b, where there is a black 13 and a red\r\n1.

The following examples,\r\nhowever, have been selected from tonalamatls in the Codex Tro-Cortesianus.\r\nThe student will note that the workmanship in the latter manuscript is far\r\ninferior to that in the Dresden Codex.

The four\r\nday signs at the left indicate that it is divided into four divisions, of\r\nwhich the first begins with the day 13 Ik.[248] Adding to this the first\r\nblack number 9, the day 9 Chuen is reached, and proceeding in this manner\r\nthe tonalamatl may be outlined as follows:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MIDDLE DIVISIONS OF PAGES 10 AND 11 OF THE CODEX\r\nTRO-CORTESIANO, SHOWING ONE TONALAMATL EXTENDING ACROSS THE TWO\r\nPAGES]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PAGE 102 OF THE CODEX TRO-CORTESIANO, SHOWING\r\nTONALAMATLS IN THE LOWER THREE SECTIONS]\r\n\r\n{263}\r\n\r\n  ---------------------+----------+----------+----------+----------\r\n                       |1st       |2d        |3d        |4th\r\n                       |Division  |Division  |Division  |Division\r\n  ---------------------+----------+------- --+----------+----------\r\n  1st part, 9 days,    |          |          |          |\r\n  beginning with day   |13 Ik     |13 Manik  |13 Eb     |13 Caban\r\n                       |          |          |          |\r\n  2d part, 9 days,     |          |          |          |\r\n  beginning with day   |9 Chuen   |9 Cib     |9 Imix    |9 Cimi\r\n                       |          |          |          |\r\n  3d part, 10 days,    |          |          |          |\r\n  beginning with day   |5 Ahau    |5 Chicchan|5 Oc      |5 Men\r\n                       |          |          |          |\r\n  4th part, 6 days,    |          |          |          |\r\n  beginning with day   |2 Oc      |2 Men     |2 Ahau    |2 Chicchan\r\n                       |          |          |          |\r\n  5th part, 2 days,    |          |          |          |\r\n  beginning with day   |8 Cib     |8 Imix    |8 Cimi    |8 Chuen\r\n                       |          |          |          |\r\n  6th part, 10 days,   |          |          |          |\r\n  beginning with day   |10 Eznab  |10 Akbal  |10 Lamat  |10 Ben\r\n                       |          |          |          |\r\n  7th part, 5 days,    |          |          |          |\r\n  beginning with day   |7 Lamat   |7 Ben     |7 Eznab   |7 Akbal\r\n                       |          |          |          |\r\n  8th part, 7 days,    |          |          |          |\r\n  beginning with day   |12 Ben    |12 Eznab  |12 Akbal  |12 Lamat\r\n                       |          |          |          |\r\n  9th part, 7 days,    |6 Ahau    |6 Chicchan|6 Oc      |6 Men\r\n  beginning with day   |[249]     |[249]     |[249]     |[249]\r\n                       |          |          |          |\r\n  Total number of days |65        |65        |65        |65\r\n  ---------------------+----------+----------+----------+----------\r\n\r\n\r\nApplying rule 4 (p. 253) to this tonalamatl, we have: 4 × 65 = 260, the\r\nexact number of days in a tonalamatl.\r\n\r\nAnother set of interesting tonalamatls is figured in plate 30, Tro-Cor.,\r\n102.[250] The first one on this page appears in the second division, 102b,\r\nand is divided into five parts, as the column of five day signs shows.

The last tonalamatl in plate 29,\r\nTro-Cor., 102d, commences with the same day, 4 Ahau, as the preceding\r\ntonalamatl and, like it, has five divisions, each of which begins with the\r\nsame day as the corresponding division in the tonalamatl just given, 4\r\nAhau, 4 Eb, 4 Kan, 4 Cib, and 4 Lamat. Tro-Cor. 102d differs from Tro-Cor.\r\n102c in the number and length of the parts into which its divisions are\r\ndivided.\r\n\r\nAdding the first black number, 29, to the beginning day, 4 Ahau, the day\r\nreached will be 7 Muluc, of which only the 7 appears in the text. Adding to\r\nthis the next black number, 24, the day reached will be 5 Ben. An\r\nexamination of the text shows, however, that the day actually recorded is 4\r\nEb, the last red number with the second day sign. This latter day is just\r\nthe day before 5 Ben, and since the sum of the black numbers in this case\r\ndoes not equal any factor of 260 (29 + 24 = 53), and since changing the\r\nlast black number from 24 to 23 would make the sum of the black numbers\r\nequal to a factor of 260 (29 + 23 = 52), and would bring the count to 4 Eb,\r\nthe day actually recorded, we are justified in assuming that there is an\r\nerror in our original text, and that 23 should have been written here\r\ninstead of 24. The outline of this tonalamatl, corrected as suggested,\r\nfollows: {265}\r\n\r\n  ----------------------+----------+---------+---------+----------+--------\r\n                        |1st       |2d       |3d       |4th       |5th\r\n                        |Division  |Division |Division |Division  |Division\r\n  ----------------------+----------+---------+---------+----------+--------\r\n  1st part, 29 days,    |          |         |         |          |\r\n  beginning with day    |4 Ahau    |4 Eb     |4 Kan    |4 Cib     |4 Lamat\r\n                        |          |         |         |          |\r\n  2d part, 23[251] days,|          |         |         |          |\r\n  beginning with day    |7 Muluc   |7 Imix   |7 Ben    |7 Chicchan|7 Caban\r\n                        |          |         |         |          |\r\n  Total number of days  |52        |52       |52       |52        |52\r\n  ----------------------+----------+---------+---------+----------+--------\r\n\r\nApplying rule 4 (p. 253) to this tonalamatl, we have: 52 × 5 = 260, the\r\nexact number of days in a tonalamatl.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing tonalamatls have been taken from the pages of the Dresden\r\nCodex or those of the Codex Tro-Cortesiano. Unfortunately, in the Codex\r\nPeresianus no complete tonalamatls remain, though one or two fragmentary\r\nones have been noted.\r\n\r\nNo matter how they are divided or with what days they begin, all\r\ntonalamatls seem to be composed of the same essentials:\r\n\r\n1. The calendric parts, made up, as we have seen on page 251, of (_a_) the\r\ncolumn of day signs; (_b_) the red numbers; (_c_) the black numbers.\r\n\r\n2. The pictures of anthropomorphic figures and animals engaged in a variety\r\nof pursuits, and\r\n\r\n3. The groups of four or six glyphs above each of the pictures.\r\n\r\nThe relation of these parts to the tonalamatl as a whole is practically\r\ndetermined. The first is the calendric background, the chronological\r\nframework, as it were, of the period. The second and third parts amplify\r\nthis and give the special meaning and significance to the subdivisions. The\r\npictures represent in all probability the deities who presided over the\r\nseveral subdivisions of the tonalamatls in which they appear, and the\r\nglyphs above them probably set forth their names, as well as the ceremonies\r\nconnected with, or the prognostications for, the corresponding periods.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen, therefore, that in its larger sense the meaning of the\r\ntonalamatl is no longer a sealed book, and while there remains a vast\r\namount of detail yet to be worked out the foundation has been laid upon\r\nwhich future investigators may build with confidence.\r\n\r\nIn closing this discussion of the tonalamatl it may not be out of place to\r\nmention here those whose names stand as pioneers in this particular field\r\nof glyphic research. To the investigations of Prof. Ernst Förstemann we owe\r\nthe elucidation of the calendric part of the tonalamatl, and to Dr. Paul\r\nSchellhas the identification of the gods and their corresponding name\r\nglyphs in parts (2) and (3), above. As pointed out at the beginning of this\r\nchapter, the most promising {266} line of research in the codices is the\r\ngroups of glyphs above the pictures, and from their decipherment will\r\nprobably come the determination of the meaning of this interesting and\r\nunusual period.\r\n\r\nTEXTS RECORDING INITIAL SERIES\r\n\r\nInitial Series in the codices are unusual and indeed have been found, up to\r\nthe present time, in only one of the three known Maya manuscripts, namely,\r\nthe Dresden Codex. As represented in this manuscript, they differ\r\nconsiderably from the Initial Series heretofore described, all of which\r\nhave been drawn from the inscriptions. This difference, however, is\r\nconfined to unessentials, and the system of counting and measuring time in\r\nthe Initial Series from the inscriptions is identical with that in the\r\nInitial Series from the codices.\r\n\r\nThe most conspicuous difference between the two is that in the codices the\r\nInitial Series are expressed by the second method, given on page 129, that\r\nis, numeration by position, while in the inscriptions, as we have seen, the\r\nperiod glyphs are used, that is, the first method, on page 105. Although\r\nthis causes the two kinds of texts to appear very dissimilar, the\r\ndifference is only superficial.\r\n\r\nAnother difference the student will note is the absence from the codices of\r\nthe so-called Initial-series \"introducing glyph.\" In a few cases there\r\nseems to be a sign occupying the position of the introducing glyph, but its\r\nidentification as the Initial-series \"introducing glyph\" is by no means\r\nsure, and, moreover, as stated above, it does not occur in all cases in\r\nwhich there are Initial Series.\r\n\r\nAnother difference is the entire absence from the codices of Supplementary\r\nSeries; this count seems to be confined exclusively to the monuments. Aside\r\nfrom these points the Initial Series from the two sources differ but\r\nlittle. All proceed from identically the same starting point, the date 4\r\nAhau 8 Cumhu, and all have their terminal dates or related Secondary-series\r\ndates recorded immediately after them.\r\n\r\nThe first example of an Initial Series from the codices will be found in\r\nplate 31 (Dresden 24), in the lower left-hand corner, in the second column\r\nto the right. The Initial-series number here recorded is 9.9.16.0.0, of\r\nwhich the zero in the 2d place (uinals) and the zero in the 1st place\r\n(kins) are expressed by red numbers. This use of red numbers in the last\r\ntwo places is due to the fact that the zero sign in the codices is _always\r\nred_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PAGE 24 OF THE DRESDEN CODEX, SHOWING INITIAL SERIES]\r\n\r\n{267} The student will note the absence of all period glyphs from this\r\nInitial Series and will observe that the multiplicands of the cycle, katun,\r\ntun, uinal, and kin are fixed by the positions of each of the corresponding\r\nmultipliers. By referring to Table XIV the values of the several positions\r\nin the second method of writing the numbers will be found, and using these\r\nwith their corresponding coefficients in each case the Initial-series\r\nnumber here recorded may be reduced to units of the 1st order, as follows:\r\n\r\n   9 × 144,000 = 1,296,000\r\n   9 ×   7,200 =    64,800\r\n  16 ×     360 =     5,760\r\n   0 ×      20 =         0\r\n   0 ×       1 =         0\r\n                ----------\r\n                 1,366,560\r\n\r\nDeducting from this number all the Calendar Rounds possible, 72 (see Table\r\nXVI), it may be reduced to zero, since 72 Calendar Rounds contain exactly\r\n1,366,560 units of the first order. See the preliminary rule on page 143.\r\n\r\nApplying rules 1, 2, and 3 (pp. 139, 140, and 141) to the remainder, that\r\nis, 0, the terminal date of the Initial Series will be found to be 4 Ahau 8\r\nCumhu, exactly the same as the starting point of Maya chronology. This must\r\nbe true, since counting forward 0 from the date 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu, the date 4\r\nAhau 8 Cumhu will be reached. Instead of recording this date immediately\r\nbelow the last period of its Initial-series number, that is, the 0 kins, it\r\nwas written below the number just to the left. The terminal date of the\r\nInitial Series we are discussing, therefore, is 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu, and it is\r\nrecorded just to the left of its usual position in the lower left-hand\r\ncorner of plate 31. The coefficient of the day sign, 4, is effaced but the\r\nremaining parts of the date are perfectly clear. Compare the day sign Ahau\r\nwith the corresponding form in figure 17, _c', d'_, and the month sign\r\nCumhu with the corresponding form in figure 20, _z-b'_. The Initial Series\r\nhere recorded is therefore 9.9.16.0.0 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu. Just to the right of\r\nthis Initial Series is another, the number part of which the student will\r\nreadily read as follows: 9.9.9.16.0. Treating this in the usual way, it may\r\nbe reduced thus:\r\n\r\n   9 × 144,000 = 1,296,000\r\n   9 ×   7,200 =    64,800\r\n   9 ×     360 =     3,240\r\n  16 ×      20 =       320\r\n   0 ×       1 =         0\r\n                ----------\r\n                 1,364,360\r\n\r\nDeducting from this number all the Calendar Rounds possible, 71 (see Table\r\nXVI), it may be reduced to 16,780. Applying to this number rules 1, 2, and\r\n3 (pp. 139, 140, and 141, respectively), its terminal date will be found to\r\nbe 1 Ahau 18 Kayab; this date is recorded just to the left below the kin\r\nplace of the _preceding_ Initial {268} Series. Compare the day sign and\r\nmonth sign of this date with figures 17, _c', d'_, and 20, _x, y_,\r\nrespectively. This second Initial Series in plate 31 therefore reads\r\n9.9.9.16.0 1 Ahau 18 Kayab. In connection with the first of these two\r\nInitial Series, 9.9.16.0.0 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu, there is recorded a Secondary\r\nSeries. This consists of 6 tuns, 2 uinals, and 0 kins (6.2.0) and is\r\nrecorded just to the left of the first Initial Series from which it is\r\ncounted, that is, in the left-hand column.\r\n\r\nIt was explained on pages 136-137 that the almost universal direction of\r\ncounting was forward, but that when the count was backward in the codices,\r\nthis fact was indicated by a special sign or symbol, which gave to the\r\nnumber it modified the significance of \"backward\" or \"minus.\" This sign is\r\nshown in figure 64, and, as explained on page 137, it usually is attached\r\nonly to the lowest period. Returning once more to our text, in plate 31 we\r\nsee this \"backward\" sign--a red circle surmounted by a knot--surrounding\r\nthe 0 kins of this Secondary-series number 6.2.0, and we are to conclude,\r\ntherefore, that this number is to be counted backward from some date.\r\n\r\nCounting it backward from the date which stands nearest it in our text, 4\r\nAhau 8 Cumhu, the date reached will be 1 Ahau 18 Kayab. But since the date\r\n4 Ahau 8 Cumhu is stated in the text to have corresponded with the\r\nInitial-series value 9.9.16.0.0, by deducting 6.2.0 from this number we may\r\nwork out the Initial-series value for this date as follows:\r\n\r\n  9.9.16. 0.0   4 Ahau 8 Cumhu\r\n       6. 2.0   Backward\r\n  9.9. 9.16.0   1 Ahau 18 Kayab\r\n\r\nThe accuracy of this last calculation is established by the fact that the\r\nInitial-series value 9.9.9.16.0 is recorded as the second Initial Series on\r\nthe page above described, and corresponds to the date 1 Ahau 18 Kayab as\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to say why the terminal dates of these two Initial Series\r\nand this Secondary Series should have been recorded to the _left_ of the\r\nnumbers leading to them, and not just _below_ the numbers in each case. The\r\nonly explanation the writer can offer is that the ancient scribe wished to\r\nhave the starting point of his Secondary-series number, 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu,\r\nrecorded as near that number as possible, that is, just below it, and\r\nconsequently the Initial Series leading to this date had to stand to the\r\nright. This caused a displacement of the corresponding terminal date of his\r\nSecondary Series, 1 Ahau 18 Kayab, which was written under the Initial\r\nSeries 9.9.16.0.0; and since the Initial-series value of 1 Ahau 18 Kayab\r\nalso appears to the right of 9.9.16.0.0 as 9.9.9.16.0, this causes a\r\ndisplacement in its terminal date likewise. {269}\r\n\r\nTwo other Initial Series will suffice to exemplify this kind of count in\r\nthe codices. In plate 32 is figured page 62 from the Dresden Codex. In the\r\ntwo right-hand columns appear two black numbers. The first of these reads\r\nquite clearly 8.16.15.16.1, which the student is perfectly justified in\r\nassuming is an Initial-series number consisting of 8 cycles, 16 katuns, 15\r\ntuns, 16 uinals, and 1 kin. Moreover, above the 8 cycles is a glyph which\r\nbears considerable resemblance to the Initial-series introducing glyph (see\r\nfig. 24, _f_). Note in particular the trinal superfix. At all events,\r\nwhether it is an Initial Series or not, the first step in deciphering it\r\nwill be to reduce this number to units of the first order:\r\n\r\n   8 × 144,000 = 1,152,000\r\n  16 ×   7,200 =   115,200\r\n  15 ×     360 =     5,400\r\n  16 ×      20 =       320\r\n   1 ×       1 =         1\r\n                ----------\r\n                 1,272,921\r\n\r\nDeducting from this number all the Calendar Rounds possible, 67 (see Table\r\nXVI), it may be reduced to 1,261. Applying rules 1, 2, and 3 (pp. 139, 140,\r\nand 141, respectively) to this remainder, the terminal date reached will be\r\n4 Imix 9 Mol. This is not the terminal date recorded, however, nor is it\r\nthe terminal date standing below the next Initial-series number to the\r\nright, 8.16.14.15.4. It would seem then that there must be some mistake or\r\nunusual feature about this Initial Series.\r\n\r\nImmediately below the date which stands under the Initial-series number we\r\nare considering, 8.16.15.16.1, is another number consisting of 1 tun, 4\r\nuinals, and 16 kins (1.4.16). It is not improbable that this is a\r\nSecondary-series number connected in some way with our Initial Series. The\r\nred circle surmounted by a knot which surrounds the 16 kins of this\r\nSecondary-series number (1.4.16) indicates that the whole number is to be\r\ncounted _backward_ from some date. Ordinarily, the first Secondary Series\r\nin a text is to be counted from the terminal date of the Initial Series,\r\nwhich we have found by calculation (if not by record) to be 4 Imix 9 Mol in\r\nthis case. Assuming that this is the case here, we might count 1.4.16\r\n_backward_ from the date 4 Imix 9 Mol.\r\n\r\nPerforming all the operations indicated in such cases, the terminal date\r\nreached will be found to be 3 Chicchan 18 Zip; this is very close to the\r\ndate which is actually recorded just above the Secondary-series number and\r\njust below the Initial-series number. The date here recorded is 3 Chicchan\r\n13 Zip, and it is not improbable that the {270} ancient scribe intended to\r\nwrite instead 3 Chicchan 18 Zip, the date indicated by the calculations. We\r\nprobably have here:\r\n\r\n  8.16.15.16. 1    (4 Imix 9 Mol)\r\n        1. 4.16     Backward\r\n  8.16.14.11. 5     3 Chicchan 18[252] Zip\r\n\r\nIn these calculations the terminal date of the Initial Series, 4 Imix 9\r\nMol, is suppressed, and the only date given is 3 Chicchan 18 Zip, the\r\nterminal date of the Secondary Series.\r\n\r\nAnother Initial Series of this same kind, one in which the terminal date is\r\nnot recorded, is shown just to the right of the preceding in plate 32. The\r\nInitial-series number 8.16.14.15.4 there recorded reduces to units of the\r\nfirst order as follows:\r\n\r\n   8 × 144,000 = 1,152,000\r\n  16 ×   7,200 =   115,200\r\n  14 ×     360 =     5,040\r\n  15 ×      20 =       300\r\n  4  ×       1 =         4\r\n                ----------\r\n                 1,272,544\r\n\r\nDeducting from this number all the Calendar Rounds possible, 67 (see Table\r\nXVI), it will be reduced to 884, and applying rules 1, 2, and 3 (pp. 139,\r\n140, and 141, respectively) to this remainder, the terminal date reached\r\nwill be 4 Kan 17 Yaxkin. This date is not recorded. There follows below,\r\nhowever, a Secondary-series number consisting of 6 uinals and 1 kin (6.1).\r\nThe red circle around the lower term of this (the 1 kin) indicates that the\r\nwhole number, 6.1, is to be counted _backward_ from some date, probably, as\r\nin the preceding case, from the terminal date of the Initial Series above\r\nit. Assuming that this is the case, and counting 6.1 backward from\r\n8.16.14.15.4 4 Kan 17 Yaxkin, the terminal date reached will be 13 Akbal 16\r\nPop, again very close to the date recorded immediately above, 13 Akbal 15\r\nPop. Indeed, the date as recorded, 13 Akbal 15 Pop, represents an\r\nimpossible condition from the Maya point of view, since the day name Akbal\r\ncould occupy only the first, sixth, eleventh, and sixteenth positions of a\r\nmonth. See Table VII. Consequently, through lack of space or carelessness\r\nthe ancient scribe who painted this book failed to add one dot to the three\r\nbars of the month sign's coefficient, thus making it 16 instead of the 15\r\nactually recorded. We are obliged to make some correction in this\r\ncoefficient, since, as explained above, it is obviously incorrect as it\r\nstands. Since the addition of a single dot brings the whole date into\r\nharmony with the date determined by calculation, we are probably justified\r\n{271} in making the correction here suggested. We have recorded here\r\ntherefore:\r\n\r\n  8.16.14.15.4    (4 Kan 17 Yaxkin)\r\n           6.1    Backward\r\n  8.16.14. 9.3    13 Akbal 16[253] Pop\r\n\r\nIn these calculations the terminal date of the Initial Series, 4 Kan 17\r\nYaxkin, is suppressed and the only date given is 13 Akbal 16 Pop, the\r\nterminal date of the Secondary Series.\r\n\r\nThe above will suffice to show the use of Initial Series in the codices,\r\nbut before leaving this subject it seems best to discuss briefly the dates\r\nrecorded by these Initial Series in relation to the Initial Series on the\r\nmonuments. According to Professor Förstemann[254] there are 27 of these\r\naltogether, distributed as follows:\r\n\r\n  Page 24:   9. 9.16. 0. 0[255]| Page 58:   9.12.11.11. 0\r\n  Page 24:   9. 9. 9.16. 0     | Page 62:   8.16.15.16. 1\r\n  Page 31:   8.16.14.15. 4     | Page 62:   8.16.14.15. 4\r\n  Page 31:   8.16. 3.13. 0     | Page 63:   8.11. 8. 7. 0\r\n  Page 31:  10.13.13. 3. 2[256]| Page 63:   8.16. 3.13. 0\r\n  Page 43:   9.19. 8.15. 0     | Page 63:  10.13. 3.16. 4[257]\r\n  Page 45:   8.17.11. 3. 0     | Page 63:  10.13.13. 3. 2\r\n  Page 51:   8.16. 4. 8. 0[258]| Page 70:   9.13.12.10. 0\r\n  Page 51:  10.19. 6. 1. 8[259]| Page 70:   9.19.11.13. 0\r\n  Page 52:   9.16. 4.11.18[260]| Page 70:  10.17.13.12.12\r\n  Page 52:   9.19. 5. 7. 8[261]| Page 70:  10.11. 3.18.14\r\n  Page 52:   9.16. 4.10. 8     | Page 70:   8. 6.16.12. 0\r\n  Page 52:   9.16. 4.11. 3     | Page 70:   8.16.19.10. 0\r\n  Page 58:   9.18. 2. 2. 0     |\r\n\r\nThere is a wide range of time covered by these Initial Series; indeed, from\r\nthe earliest 8.6.16.12.0 (on p. 70) to the latest, 10.19.6.1.8 (on p. 51)\r\nthere elapsed more than a thousand years. Where the difference between the\r\nearliest and the latest dates is so great, it is a matter of vital\r\nimportance to determine the contemporaneous date of the manuscript. If the\r\nclosing date 10.19.6.1.8 represents the time at which the manuscript was\r\nmade, then the preceding dates reach back {272} for more than a thousand\r\nyears. On the other hand, if 8.6.16.12.0 records the present time of the\r\nmanuscript, then all the following dates are prophetic. It is a difficult\r\nquestion to answer, and the best authorities have seemed disposed to take a\r\nmiddle course, assigning as the contemporaneous date of the codex a date\r\nabout the middle of Cycle 9. Says Professor Förstemann (_Bulletin 28_, p.\r\n402) on the subject:\r\n\r\n    In my opinion my demonstration also definitely proves that these large\r\n    numbers [the Initial Series] do not proceed from the future to the\r\n    past, but from the past, through the present, to the future. Unless I\r\n    am quite mistaken, the highest numbers among them seem actually to\r\n    reach into the future, and thus to have a prophetic meaning. Here the\r\n    question arises, At what point in this series of numbers does the\r\n    present lie? or, Has the writer in different portions of his work\r\n    adopted different points of time as the present? If I may venture to\r\n    express my conjecture, it seems to me that the first large number in\r\n    the whole manuscript, the 1,366,560 in the second column of page 24\r\n    [9.9.16.0.0 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu, the first Initial Series figured in plate\r\n    31], has the greatest claim to be interpreted as the present point of\r\n    time.\r\n\r\nIn a later article (_Bulletin 28_, p. 437) Professor Förstemann says: \"But\r\nI think it is more probable that the date farthest to the right (1 Ahau, 18\r\nZip ...) denotes the present, the other two [namely, 9.9.16.0.0 4 Ahau 8\r\nCumhu and 9.9.9.16.0 1 Ahau 18 Kayab] alluding to remarkable days in the\r\nfuture.\" He assigns to this date 1 Ahau 18 Zip the position of 9.7.16.12.0\r\nin the Long Count.\r\n\r\nThe writer believes this theory to be untenable because it involves a\r\ncorrection in the original text. The date which Professor Förstemann calls\r\n1 Ahau 18 Zip actually reads 1 Ahau 18 Uo, as he himself admits. The month\r\nsign he corrects to Zip in spite of the fact that it is very clearly Uo.\r\nCompare this form with figure 20, _b, c_. The date 1 Ahau 18 Uo occurs at\r\n9.8.16.16.0, but the writer sees no reason for believing that this date or\r\nthe reading suggested by Professor Förstemann indicates the contemporaneous\r\ntime of this manuscript.\r\n\r\nMr. Bowditch assigns the manuscript to approximately the same period,\r\nselecting the second Initial Series in plate 31, that is, 9.9.9.16.0 1 Ahau\r\n18 Kayab: \"My opinion is that the date 9.9.9.16.0 1 Ahau 18 Kayab is the\r\npresent time with reference to the time of writing the codex and is the\r\ndate from which the whole calculation starts.\"[262] The reasons which have\r\nled Mr. Bowditch to this conclusion are very convincing and will make for\r\nthe general acceptance of his hypothesis.\r\n\r\nAlthough the writer has no better suggestion to offer at the present time,\r\nhe is inclined to believe that both of these dates are far too early for\r\nthis manuscript and that it is to be ascribed to a very much later period,\r\nperhaps to the centuries following immediately the colonization of Yucatan.\r\nThere can be no doubt that very early dates appear in the Dresden Codex,\r\nbut rather than accept one so early as 9.9.9.16.0 or 9.9.16.0.0 as the\r\ncontemporaneous date of the manuscript the writer would prefer to believe,\r\non historical grounds, that the manuscript now known as the Dresden Codex\r\nis a copy of an earlier manuscript and that the present copy dates from the\r\nlater Maya period in Yucatan, though sometime before either Nahuatl or\r\nCastilian acculturation had begun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PAGE 62 OF THE DRESDEN CODEX, SHOWING THE SERPENT\r\nNUMBERS]\r\n\r\n{273}\r\n\r\nTEXTS RECORDING SERPENT NUMBERS\r\n\r\nThe Dresden Codex contains another class of numbers which, so far as known,\r\noccur nowhere else. These have been called the Serpent numbers because\r\ntheir various orders of units are depicted between the coils of serpents.\r\nTwo of these serpents appear in plate 32. The coils of each serpent inclose\r\ntwo different numbers, one in red and the other in black. Every one of the\r\nSerpent numbers has six terms, and they represent by far the highest\r\nnumbers to be found in the codices. The black number in the first, or\r\nleft-hand serpent in plate 32, reads as follows: 4.6.7.12.4.10, which,\r\nreduced to units of the first order, reads:\r\n\r\n   4 × 2,880,000 = 11,520,000\r\n   6 ×   144,000 =    864,000\r\n   7 ×     7,200 =     50,400\r\n  12 ×       360 =      4,320\r\n   4 ×        20 =         80\r\n  10 ×         1 =         10\r\n                   ----------\r\n                   12,438,810\r\n\r\nThe next question which arises is, What is the starting point from which\r\nthis number is counted? Just below it the student will note the date 3 Ix 7\r\nTzec, which from its position would seem almost surely to be either the\r\nstarting point or the terminal date, more probably the latter. Assuming\r\nthat this date is the terminal date, the starting point may be calculated\r\nby counting 12,438,810 _backward_ from 3 Ix 7 Tzec. Performing this\r\noperation according to the rules laid down in such cases, the starting\r\npoint reached will be 9 Kan 12 Xul, but this date is not found in the text.\r\n\r\nThe red number in the first serpent is 4.6.11.10.7.2, which reduces to--\r\n\r\n   4 × 2,880,000 = 11,520,000\r\n   6 ×   144,000 =    864,000\r\n  11 ×     7,200 =     79,200\r\n  10 ×       360 =      3,600\r\n   7 ×        20 =        140\r\n   2 ×         1 =          2\r\n                   ----------\r\n                   12,466,942\r\n\r\n{274} Assuming that the date below this number, 3 Cimi 14 Kayab, was its\r\nterminal date, the starting point can be reached by counting backward. This\r\nwill be found to be 9 Kan 12 Kayab, a date actually found on this page (see\r\npl. 32), just above the animal figure emerging from the second serpent's\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\nThe black number in the second serpent reads 4.6.9.15.12.19, which reduces\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n   4 × 2,880,000 = 11,520,000\r\n   6 ×   144,000 =    864,000\r\n   9 ×     7,200 =     64,800\r\n  15 ×       360 =      5,400\r\n  12 ×        20 =        240\r\n  19 ×         1 =         19\r\n                   ----------\r\n                   12,454,459\r\n\r\nAssuming that the date below this number, 13 Akbal 1 Kankin, was the\r\nterminal date, its starting point can be shown by calculation to be just\r\nthe same as the starting point for the previous number, that is, the date 9\r\nKan 12 Kayab, and as mentioned above, this date appears above the animal\r\nfigure emerging from the mouth of this serpent.\r\n\r\nThe last Serpent number in plate 32, the red number in the second serpent,\r\nreads, 4.6.1.9.15.0 and reduces as follows:\r\n\r\n   4 × 2,880,000 = 11,520,000\r\n   6 ×   144,000 =    864,000\r\n   1 ×     7,200 =      7,200\r\n   9 ×       360 =      3,240\r\n  15 ×        20 =        300\r\n   0 ×         1 =          0\r\n                   ----------\r\n                   12,394,740\r\n\r\nAssuming that the date below this number, 3 Kan 17 Uo,[263] was its\r\nterminal date, its starting point can be shown by calculation to be just\r\nthe same as the starting point of the two preceding numbers, namely, the\r\ndate 9 Kan 12 Kayab, which appears above this last serpent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 85. Example of first method of numeration in the\r\ncodices (part of page 69 of the Dresden Codex).]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the foregoing that three of the four Serpent dates\r\nabove described are counted from the date 9 Kan 12 Kayab, a date actually\r\nrecorded in the text just above them. The all-important question of course\r\nis, What position did the date 9 Kan 12 Kayab occupy in the Long Count? The\r\npage (62) of the Dresden Codex we {275} are discussing sheds no light on\r\nthis question. There are, however, two other pages in this Codex (61 and\r\n69) on which Serpent numbers appear presenting this date, 9 Kan 12 Kayab,\r\nunder conditions which may shed light on the position it held in the Long\r\nCount. On page 69 there are recorded 15 katuns, 9 tuns, 4 uinals, and 4\r\nkins (see fig. 85); these are immediately followed by the date 9 Kan 12\r\nKayab. It is important to note in this connection that, unlike almost every\r\nother number in this codex, this number is expressed by the first method,\r\nthe one in which the period glyphs are used. As the date 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu\r\nappears just above in the text, the first supposition is that 15.9.4.4 is a\r\nSecondary-series number which, if counted forward from 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu, the\r\nstarting point of Maya chronology, will reach 9 Kan 12 Kayab, the date\r\nrecorded immediately after it. Proceeding on this assumption and performing\r\nthe operations indicated, the terminal date reached will be 9 Kan 7 Cumhu,\r\nnot 9 Kan 12 Kayab, as recorded. The most plausible explanation for this\r\nnumber and date the writer can offer is that the whole constitutes a\r\nPeriod-ending date. On the west side of Stela C at Quirigua, as explained\r\non page 226, is a Period-ending date almost exactly like this (see pl. 21,\r\n_H_). On this monument 17.5.0.0 6 Ahau 13 Kayab is recorded, and it was\r\nproved by calculation that 9.17.5.0.0 would lead to this date if counted\r\nforward from the starting point of Maya chronology. In effect, then, this\r\n17.5.0.0 6 Ahau 13 Kayab was a Period-ending date, declaring that Tun 5 of\r\nKatun 17 (of Cycle 9, unexpressed) ended on the date 6 Ahau 13 Kayab.\r\n\r\nInterpreting in the same way the glyphs in figure 85, we have the record\r\nthat Kin 4 of Uinal 4 of Tun 9 of Katun 15 (of Cycle 9, unexpressed) fell\r\n(or ended) on the date 9 Kan 12 Kayab. Changing this Period-ending date\r\ninto its corresponding Initial Series and solving for its terminal date,\r\nthe latter date will be found to be 13 Kan 12 Ceh, instead of 9 Kan 12\r\nKayab. At first this would appear to be even farther from the mark than our\r\npreceding attempt, but if the reader will admit a slight correction, the\r\nabove number can be made to reach the date recorded. The date 13 Kan 12 Ceh\r\nis just 5 uinals earlier than 9 Kan 12 Kayab, and if we add one bar to the\r\nfour dots of the uinal coefficient, this passage can be explained in the\r\nabove manner, and yet agree in all particulars. This is true since\r\n9.15.9.9.4 reaches the date 9 Kan 12 Kayab. On the above grounds the writer\r\nis inclined to believe that the last three Serpent numbers on plate 32,\r\nwhich were shown to have proceeded from a date 9 Kan 12 Kayab, were counted\r\nfrom the date 9.15.9.9.4 9 Kan 12 Kayab. {276}\r\n\r\nTEXTS RECORDING ASCENDING SERIES\r\n\r\nThere remains one other class of numbers which should be described before\r\nclosing this chapter on the codices. The writer refers to the series of\r\nrelated numbers which cover so many pages of the Dresden Codex. These\r\ncommence at the bottom of the page and increase toward the top, every other\r\nnumber in the series being a multiple of the first, or beginning number.\r\nOne example of this class will suffice to illustrate all the others.\r\n\r\nIn the lower right-hand corner of plate 31 a series of this kind commences\r\nwith the day 9 Ahau.[264] Of this series the number 8.2.0 just above the 9\r\nAhau is the first term, and the day 9 Ahau the first terminal date. As\r\nusual in Maya texts, the starting point is not expressed; by calculation,\r\nhowever, it can be shown to be 1 Ahau[265] in this particular case.\r\n\r\nCounting forward then 8.2.0 from 1 Ahau, the unexpressed starting point,\r\nthe first terminal date, 9 Ahau, will be reached. See the lower right-hand\r\ncorner in the following outline, in which the Maya numbers have all been\r\nreduced to units of the first order:\r\n\r\n  151,840[266]       113,880[266]      75,920[266]       37,960[266]\r\n  1 Ahau             1 Ahau            1 Ahau            1 Ahau\r\n  185,120            68,900            33,280            9,100\r\n  1 Ahau             1 Ahau            1 Ahau            1 Ahau\r\n  35,040             32,120            29,200            26,280\r\n  6 Ahau             11 Ahau           3 Ahau            8 Ahau\r\n  23,360             20,440            17,520            14,600\r\n  13 Ahau            5 Ahau            10 Ahau           2 Ahau\r\n  11,680[267]        8,760             5,840             2,920\r\n  7 Ahau             12 Ahau           4 Ahau            9 Ahau\r\n        (Unexpressed starting point, 1 Ahau.)\r\n\r\nIn the above outline each number represents the total distance of the day\r\njust below it from the unexpressed starting point, 1 Ahau, _not_ the\r\ndistance from the date immediately preceding it in the series. For example,\r\nthe second number, 5,840 (16.4.0), is not to be counted forward from 9 Ahau\r\nin order to reach its terminal date, 4 Ahau, but from the unexpressed\r\nstarting point of the whole series, the day 1 Ahau. Similarly the third\r\nnumber, 8,760 (1.4.6.0), is not to be counted forward from 4 Ahau in order\r\nto reach 12 Ahau, but from 1 Ahau instead, and so on throughout the series.\r\n{277}\r\n\r\nBeginning with the number 2,920 and the starting point 1 Ahau, the first\r\ntwelve terms, that is, the numbers in the three lowest rows, are the first\r\n12 multiples of 2,920.\r\n\r\n   2,920 = 1 × 2,920    20,440 =  7 × 2,920\r\n   5,840 = 2 × 2,920    23,360 =  8 × 2,920\r\n   8,760 = 3 × 2,920    26,280 =  9 × 2,920\r\n  11,680 = 4 × 2,920    29,200 = 10 × 2,920\r\n  14,600 = 5 × 2,920    32,120 = 11 × 2,920\r\n  17,520 = 6 × 2,920    35,040 = 12 × 2,920\r\n\r\nThe days recorded under each of these numbers, as mentioned above, are the\r\nterminal dates of these distances from the starting point, 1 Ahau. Passing\r\nover the fourth row from the bottom, which, as will appear presently, is\r\nprobably an interpolation of some kind, the thirteenth number--that is, the\r\nright-hand one in the top row--is 37,960. But 37,960 is 13 × 2,920, a\r\ncontinuation of our series the twelfth term of which appeared in the\r\nleft-hand number of the third row. Under the thirteenth number is set down\r\nthe day 1 Ahau; in other words, not until the thirteenth multiple of 2,920\r\nis reached is the terminal day the same as the starting point.\r\n\r\nWith this thirteenth term 2,920 ceases to be the unit of increase, and the\r\nthirteenth term itself (37,960) is used as a difference to reach the\r\nremaining three terms on this top line, all of which are multiples of\r\n37,960.\r\n\r\n   37,960 = 1 × 37,960 or 13 × 2,920\r\n   75,920 = 2 × 37,960 or 26 × 2,920\r\n  113,880 = 3 × 37,960 or 39 × 2,920\r\n  151,840 = 4 × 37,960 or 52 × 2,920\r\n\r\nCounting forward each one of these from the starting point of this entire\r\nseries, 1 Ahau, each will be found to reach as its terminal day 1 Ahau, as\r\nrecorded under each. The fourth line from the bottom is more difficult to\r\nunderstand, and the explanation offered by Professor Förstemann, that the\r\nfirst and third terms and the second and fourth are to be combined by\r\naddition or subtraction, leaves much to be desired. Omitting this row,\r\nhowever, the remaining numbers, those which are multiples of 2,920, admit\r\nof an easy explanation.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the opening term 2,920, which serves as the unit of\r\nincrease for the entire series up to and including the 13th term, is the\r\nso-called Venus-Solar period, containing 8 Solar years of 365 days each and\r\n5 Venus years of 584 days each. This important period is the subject of\r\nextended treatment elsewhere in the Dresden Codex (pp. 46-50), in which it\r\nis repeated 39 times in all, divided into three equal divisions of 13\r\nperiods each. The 13th term of our series 37,960 is, as we have seen, 13 ×\r\n2,920, the exact number of {278} days treated of in the upper divisions of\r\npages 46-50 of the Dresden Codex. The 14th term (75,920) is the exact\r\nnumber of days treated of in the first two divisions, and finally, the\r\n15th, or next to the last term (113,880), is the exact number of days\r\ntreated of in all three divisions of these pages.\r\n\r\nThis 13th term (37,960) is the first in which the tonalamatl of 260 days\r\ncomes into harmony with the Venus and Solar years, and as such must have\r\nbeen of very great importance to the Maya. At the same time it represents\r\ntwo Calendar Rounds, another important chronological count. With the next\r\nto the last term (113,880) the Mars year of 780 days is brought into\r\nharmony with all the other periods named. This number, as just mentioned,\r\nrepresents the sum of all the 39 Venus-Solar periods on pages 46-50 of the\r\nDresden Codex. This next to the last number seems to possess more\r\nremarkable properties than the last number (151,840), in which the Mars\r\nyear is not contained without a remainder, and the reason for its record\r\ndoes not appear.\r\n\r\nThe next to the last term contains:\r\n\r\n  438 Tonalamatls of 260 days each\r\n  312 Solar years of 365 days each\r\n  195 Venus years of 584 days each\r\n  146 Mars years of 780 days each\r\n   39 Venus-Solar periods of 2,920 days each\r\n    6 Calendar Rounds of 18,980 days each\r\n\r\nIt will be noted in plate 31 that the concealed starting point of this\r\nseries is the day 1 Ahau, and that just to the left on the same plate are\r\ntwo dates, 1 Ahau 18 Kayab and 1 Ahau 18 Uo, both of which show this same\r\nday, and one of which, 1 Ahau 18 Kayab, is accompanied by its corresponding\r\nInitial Series 9.9.9.16.0. It seems not unlikely, therefore, that the day 1\r\nAhau with which this series commences was 1 Ahau 18 Kayab, which in turn\r\nwas 9.9.9.16.0 1 Ahau 18 Kayab of the Long Count. This is rendered somewhat\r\nprobable by the fact that the second division of 13 Venus-Solar periods on\r\npages 46-50 of the Dresden Codex also has the same date, 1 Ahau 18 Kayab,\r\nas its terminal date. Hence, it is not improbable (more it would be unwise\r\nto say) that the series of numbers which we have been discussing was\r\ncounted from the date 9.9.9.16.0. 1 Ahau 18 Kayab.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing examples cover, in a general way, the material presented in\r\nthe codices; there is, however, much other matter which has not been\r\nexplained here, as unfitted to the needs of the beginner. To the student\r\nwho wishes to specialize in this field of the glyphic writing the writer\r\nrecommends the treatises of Prof. Ernst Förstemann as the most valuable\r\ncontribution to this subject.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n{279}\r\n\r\n           INDEX\r\n\r\n  ABBREVIATION IN DATING, use, 222, 252\r\n  ADDITION, method, 149\r\n  ADULTERY, punishment, 9-10\r\n  AGUILAR, S.

The Inca, for example, excelled them in the\r\narts of weaving and dyeing, the Chiriqui in metal working, and the Aztec in\r\nmilitary proficiency.\r\n\r\n[2] The correlation of Maya and Christian chronology herein followed is\r\nthat suggested by the writer in \"The Correlation of Maya and Christian\r\nChronology\" (_Papers of the School of American Archæology_, No. 11). See\r\nMorley, 1910 b, cited in BIBLIOGRAPHY, pp. XV, XVI. There are at least six\r\nother systems of correlation, however, on which the student must pass\r\njudgment. Although no two of these agree, all are based on data derived\r\nfrom the same source, namely, the Books of Chilan Balam (see p. 3, footnote\r\n1). The differences among them are due to the varying interpretations of\r\nthe material therein presented. Some of the systems of correlation which\r\nhave been proposed, besides that of the writer, are:\r\n\r\n1. That of Mr. C. P. Bowditch (1901 a), found in his pamphlet entitled\r\n\"Memoranda on the Maya Calendars used in The Books of Chilan Balam.\"\r\n\r\n2. That of Prof. Eduard Seler (1902-1908: I, pp. 588-599). See also\r\n_Bulletin 28_, p. 330.\r\n\r\n3. That of Mr. J. T. Goodman (1905).\r\n\r\n4. That of Pio Perez, in Stephen's Incidents of Travel in Yucatan (1843: I,\r\npp. 434-459; II, pp. 465-469) and in Landa, 1864: pp. 366-429.\r\n\r\nAs before noted, these correlations differ greatly from one another,\r\nProfessor Seler assigning the most remote dates to the southern cities and\r\nMr. Goodman the most recent. The correlations of Mr. Bowditch and the\r\nwriter are within 260 years of each other. Before accepting any one of the\r\nsystems of correlation above mentioned, the student is strongly urged to\r\nexamine with care The Books of Chilan Balam.\r\n\r\n[3] It is probable that at this early date Yucatan had not been discovered,\r\nor at least not colonized.\r\n\r\n[4] This evidence is presented by The Books of Chilan Balam, \"which were\r\ncopied or compiled in Yucatan by natives during the sixteenth, seventeenth,\r\nand eighteenth centuries, from much older manuscripts now lost or\r\ndestroyed. They are written in the Maya language in Latin characters, and\r\ntreat, in part at least, of the history of the country before the Spanish\r\nConquest. Each town seems to have had its own book of Chilan Balam,\r\ndistinguished from others by the addition of the name of the place where it\r\nwas written, as: The Book of Chilan Balam of Mani, The Book of Chilan Balam\r\nof Tizimia, and so on. Although much of the material presented in these\r\nmanuscripts is apparently contradictory and obscure, their importance as\r\noriginal historical sources can not be overestimated, since they constitute\r\nthe only native accounts of the early history of the Maya race which have\r\nsurvived the vandalism of the Spanish Conquerors. Of the sixteen Books of\r\nChilan Balam now extant, only three, those of the towns of Mani, Tizimin,\r\nand Chumayel, contain historical matter. These have been translated into\r\nEnglish, and published by Dr. D. G. Brinton [1882 b] under the title of\r\n\"The Maya Chronicles.\" This translation with a few corrections has been\r\nfreely consulted in the following discussion.\"--MORLEY, 1910 b: p. 193.\r\n\r\nAlthough The Books of Chilan Balam are in all probability authentic sources\r\nfor the reconstruction of Maya history, they can hardly be considered\r\ncontemporaneous since, as above explained, they emanate from post-Conquest\r\ntimes. The most that can be claimed for them in this connection is that the\r\ndocuments from which they were copied were probably aboriginal, and\r\ncontemporaneous, or approximately so, with the later periods of the history\r\nwhich they record.\r\n\r\n[5] As will appear later, on the calendric side the old system of counting\r\ntime and of recording events gave place to a more abbreviated though less\r\naccurate chronology. In architecture and art also the change of environment\r\nmade itself felt, and in other lines as well the new land cast a strong\r\ninfluence over Maya thought and achievement. In his work entitled \"A Study\r\nof Maya Art, its Subject Matter and Historical Development\" (1913), to\r\nwhich students are referred for further information, Dr. H. J. Spinden has\r\ntreated this subject extensively.\r\n\r\n[6] The confederation of these three Maya cities may have served as a model\r\nfor the three Nahua cities, Tenochtitlan, Tezcuco, and Tlacopan, when they\r\nentered into a similar alliance some four centuries later.\r\n\r\n[7] By Nahua is here meant the peoples who inhabited the valley of Mexico\r\nand adjacent territory at this time.\r\n\r\n[8] The Ball Court, a characteristically Nahua development.\r\n\r\n[9] One authority (Landa, 1864: p. 48) says in this connection: \"The\r\ngovernor, Cocom--the ruler of Mayapan--began to covet riches; and for this\r\npurpose he treated with the people of the garrison, which the kings of\r\nMexico had in Tabasco and Xicalango, that he should deliver his city [i. e.\r\nMayapan] to them; and thus he brought the Mexican people to Mayapan and he\r\noppressed the poor and made many slaves, and the lords would have killed\r\nhim if they had not been afraid of the Mexicans.\"\r\n\r\n[10] The first appearance of the Spaniards in Yucatan was six years earlier\r\n(in 1511), when the caravel of Valdivia, returning from the Isthmus of\r\nDarien to Hispaniola, foundered near Jamaica. About 10 survivors in an open\r\nboat were driven upon the coast of Yucatan near the Island of Cozumel. Here\r\nthey were made prisoners by the Maya and five, including Valdivia himself,\r\nwere sacrificed. The remainder escaped only to die of starvation and\r\nhardship, with the exception of two, Geronimo de Aguilar and Gonzalo\r\nGuerrero. Both of these men had risen to considerable prominence in the\r\ncountry by the time Cortez arrived eight years later. Guerrero had married\r\na chief's daughter and had himself become a chief. Later Aguilar became an\r\ninterpreter for Cortez. This handful of Spaniards can hardly be called an\r\nexpedition, however.\r\n\r\n[11] Diego de Landa, second bishop of Merida, whose remarkable book\r\nentitled \"Relacion de las Cosas de Yucatan\" is the chief authority for the\r\nfacts presented in the following discussion of the manners and customs of\r\nthe Maya, was born in Cifuentes de l'Alcarria, Spain, in 1524. At the age\r\nof 17 he joined the Franciscan order. He came to Yucatan during the decade\r\nfollowing the close of the Conquest, in 1549, where he was one of the most\r\nzealous of the early missionaries. In 1573 he was appointed bishop of\r\nMerida, which position he held until his death in 1579. His priceless\r\n_Relacion_, written about 1565, was not printed until three centuries\r\nlater, when it was discovered by the indefatigable Abbé Brasseur de\r\nBourbourg in the library of the Royal Academy of History at Madrid, and\r\npublished by him in 1864. The _Relacion_ is the standard authority for the\r\ncustoms prevalent in Yucatan at the time of the Conquest, and is an\r\ninvaluable aid to the student of Maya archeology. What little we know of\r\nthe Maya calendar has been derived directly from the pages of this book, or\r\nby developing the material therein presented.\r\n\r\n[12] The excavations of Mr. E. H. Thompson at Labna, Yucatan, and of Dr.\r\nMerwin at Holmul, Guatemala, have confirmed Bishop Landa's statement\r\nconcerning the disposal of the dead. At Labna bodies were found buried\r\nbeneath the floors of the buildings, and at Holmul not only beneath the\r\nfloors but also lying on them.\r\n\r\n[13] Examples of this type of burial have been found at Chichen Itza and\r\nMayapan in Yucatan. At the former site Mr. E. H. Thompson found in the\r\ncenter of a large pyramid a stone-lined shaft running from the summit into\r\nthe ground. This was filled with burials and funeral objects--pearls,\r\ncoral, and jade, which from their precious nature indicated the remains of\r\nimportant personages. At Mayapan, burials were found in a shaft of similar\r\nconstruction and location in one of the pyramids.\r\n\r\n[14] Landa, 1864: p. 137.\r\n\r\n[15] As the result of a trip to the Maya field in the winter of 1914, the\r\nwriter made important discoveries in the chronology of Tikal, Naranjo,\r\nPiedras Negras, Altar de Sacrificios, Quirigua, and Seibal. The occupancy\r\nof Tikal and Seibal was found to have extended to 10.2.0.0.0; of Piedras\r\nNegras to 9.18.5.0.0; of Naranjo to 9.19.10.0.0; and of Altar de\r\nSacrificios to 9.14.0.0.0. (This new material is not embodied in pl. 2.)\r\n\r\n[16] As will be explained in chapter V, the writer has suggested the name\r\n_hotun_ for the 5 tun, or 1,800 day, period.\r\n\r\n[17] Succession in the Aztec royal house was not determined by\r\nprimogeniture, though the supreme office, the _tlahtouani_, as well as the\r\nother high offices of state, was hereditary in one family. On the death of\r\nthe tlahtouani the electors (four in number) seem to have selected his\r\nsuccessor from among his brothers, or, these failing, from among his\r\nnephews. Except as limiting the succession to one family, primogeniture\r\ndoes not seem to have obtained; for example, Moctezoma (Montezuma) was\r\nchosen tlahtouani over the heads of several of his older brothers because\r\nhe was thought to have the best qualifications for that exalted office. The\r\nsituation may be summarized by the statement that while the supreme ruler\r\namong the Aztec had to be of the \"blood royal,\" his selection was\r\ndetermined by personal merit rather than by primogeniture.\r\n\r\n[18] There can be no doubt that Förstemann has identified the sign for the\r\nplanet Venus and possibly a few others. (See Förstemann, 1906: p. 116.)\r\n\r\n[19] Brasseur de Bourbourg, the \"discoverer\" of Landa's manuscript, added\r\nseveral signs of his own invention to the original Landa alphabet. See his\r\nintroduction to the Codex Troano published by the French Government. Leon\r\nde Rosny published an alphabet of 29 letters with numerous variants. Later\r\nDr. F. Le Plongeon defined 23 letters with variants and made elaborate\r\ninterpretations of the texts with this \"alphabet\" as his key. Another\r\nalphabet was that proposed by Dr. Hilborne T. Cresson, which included\r\nsyllables as well as letters, and with which its originator also essayed to\r\nread the texts. Scarce worthy of mention are the alphabet and volume of\r\ninterlinear translations from both the inscriptions and the codices\r\npublished by F. A. de la Rochefoucauld. This is very fantastic and utterly\r\nwithout value unless, as Doctor Brinton says, it be taken \"as a warning\r\nagainst the intellectual aberrations to which students of these ancient\r\nmysteries seem peculiarly prone.\" The late Dr. Cyrus Thomas, of the Bureau\r\nof American Ethnology, was the last of those who endeavored to interpret\r\nthe Maya texts by means of alphabets; though he was perhaps the best of\r\nthem all, much of his work in this particular respect will not stand.\r\n\r\n[20] Thus the whole rebus in figure 14 reads: \"Eye bee leaf ant rose can\r\nwell bear awl four ewe.\" These words may be replaced by their homophones as\r\nfollows: \"I believe Aunt Rose can well bear all for you.\"\r\n\r\nRebus writing depends on the principle of homophones; that is, words or\r\ncharacters which sound alike but have different meanings.\r\n\r\n[21] The period of the synodical revolution of Venus as computed to-day is\r\n583.920 days.\r\n\r\n[22] According to modern calculations, the period of the lunar revolution\r\nis 29.530588, or approximately 29½ days. For 405 revolutions the\r\naccumulated error would be .03×405=12.15 days. This error the Maya obviated\r\nby using 29.5 in some calculations and 29.6 in others, the latter\r\noffsetting the former. Thus the first 17 revolutions of the sequence are\r\ndivided into three groups; the first 6 revolutions being computed at 29.5,\r\neach giving a total of 177 days; and the second 6 revolutions also being\r\ncomputed at 29.5 each, giving a total of another 177 days. The third group\r\nof 5 revolutions, however, was computed at 29.6 each, giving a total of 148\r\ndays. The total number of days in the first 17 revolutions was thus\r\ncomputed to be 177+177+147=502, which is very close to the time computed by\r\nmodern calculations, 502.02.\r\n\r\n[23] This is the tropical year or the time from one equinox to its return.\r\n\r\n[24] Landa, 1864: p. 52.\r\n\r\n[25] Cogolludo, 1688: I, lib. IV, V, p. 186.\r\n\r\n[26] For example, if the revolution of Venus had been the governing\r\nphenomenon, each monument would be distant from some other by 584 days; if\r\nthat of Mars, 780 days; if that of Mercury, 115 or 116 days, etc.\r\nFurthermore, the sequence, once commenced, would naturally have been more\r\nor less uninterrupted. It is hardly necessary to repeat that the intervals\r\nwhich have been found, namely, 7200 and 1800, rest on no known astronomical\r\nphenomena but are the direct result of the Maya vigesimal system of\r\nnumeration.\r\n\r\n[27] It is possible that the Codex Peresianus may treat of historical\r\nmatter, as already explained.\r\n\r\n[28] Since the sequence of the twenty day names was continuous, it is\r\nobvious that it had no beginning or ending, like the rim of a wheel;\r\nconsequently any day name may be chosen arbitrarily as the starting point.\r\nIn the accompanying Kan has been chosen to begin with, though Bishop Landa\r\n(p. 236) states with regard to the Maya: \"The character or letter with\r\nwhich they commence their count of the days or calendar is called Hun-ymix\r\n[i. e. 1 Imix]\". Again, \"Here commences the count of the calendar of the\r\nIndians, saying in their language Hun Imix (*) [i. e. 1 Imix].\" (Ibid., p.\r\n246.)\r\n\r\n[29] Professor Seler says the Maya of Guatemala called this period the _kin\r\nkatun_, or \"order of the days.\" He fails to give his authority for this\r\nstatement, however, and, as will appear later, these terms have entirely\r\ndifferent meanings. (See _Bulletin 28_, p. 14.)\r\n\r\n[30] As Bishop Landa wrote not later than 1579, this is Old Style. The\r\ncorresponding day in the Gregorian Calendar would be July 27.\r\n\r\n[31] This is probably to be accounted for by the fact that in the Maya\r\nsystem of chronology, as we shall see later, the 365-day year was not used\r\nin recording time. But that so fundamental a period had therefore no\r\nspecial glyph does not necessarily follow, and the writer believes the sign\r\nfor the haab will yet be discovered.\r\n\r\n[32] Later researches of the writer (1914) have convinced him that figure\r\n19, _c_, is not a sign for Uo, but a very unusual variant of the sign for\r\nZip, found only at Copan, and there only on monuments belonging to the\r\nfinal period.\r\n\r\n[33] The writer was able to prove during his last trip to the Maya field\r\nthat figure 19, _f_, is not a sign for the month Zotz, as suggested by Mr.\r\nBowditch, but a very unusual form representing Kankin. This identification\r\nis supported by a number of examples at Piedras Negras.\r\n\r\n[34] The meanings of these words in Nahuatl, the language spoken by the\r\nAztec, are \"year bundle\" and \"our years will be bound,\" respectively. These\r\ndoubtless refer to the fact that at the expiration of this period the Aztec\r\ncalendar had made one complete round; that is, the years were bound up and\r\ncommenced anew.\r\n\r\n[35] _Bulletin 28_, p. 330.\r\n\r\n[36] All Initial Series now known, with the exception of two, have the date\r\n4 Ahau 8 Cumhu as their common point of departure. The two exceptions, the\r\nInitial Series on the east side of Stela C at Quirigua and the one on the\r\ntablet in the Temple of the Cross at Palenque, proceed from the date 4 Ahau\r\n8 Zotz--more than 5,000 years in advance of the starting point just named.\r\nThe writer has no suggestions to offer in explanation of these two dates\r\nother than that he believes they refer to some mythological event. For\r\ninstance, in the belief of the Maya the gods may have been born on the day\r\n4 Ahau 8 Zotz, and 5,000 years later approximately on 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu the\r\nworld, including mankind, may have been created.\r\n\r\n[37] Some writers have called the date 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu, the normal date,\r\nprobably because it is the standard date from which practically all Maya\r\ncalculations proceed. The writer has not followed this practice, however.\r\n\r\n[38] That is, dates which signified present time when they were recorded.\r\n\r\n[39] This statement does not take account of the Tuxtla Statuette and the\r\nHolactun Initial Series, which extend the range of the dated monuments to\r\nten centuries.\r\n\r\n[40] For the discussion of the number of cycles in a great cycle, a\r\nquestion concerning which there are two different opinions, see pp. 107 et\r\nseq.\r\n\r\n[41] There are only two known exceptions to this statement, namely, the\r\nInitial Series on the Temple of the Cross at Palenque and that on the east\r\nside of Stela C at Quirigua, already noted.\r\n\r\n[42] Mr. Bowditch (1910: App. VIII, 310-18) discusses the possible meanings\r\nof this element.\r\n\r\n[43] For explanation of the term \"full-figure glyphs,\" see p. 67.\r\n\r\n[44] See the discussion of Serpent numbers in Chapter VI.\r\n\r\n[45] These three inscriptions are found on Stela N, west side, at Copan,\r\nthe tablet of the Temple of the Inscriptions at Palenque, and Stela 10 at\r\nTikal. For the discussion of these inscriptions, see pp. 114-127.\r\n\r\n[46] The discussion of glyphs which may represent the great cycle or period\r\nof the 6th order will be presented on pp. 114-127 in connection with the\r\ndiscussion of numbers having six or more orders of units.\r\n\r\n[47] The figure on Zoömorph B at Quirigua, however, has a normal human head\r\nwithout grotesque characteristics.\r\n\r\n[48] The full-figure glyphs are included with the head variants in this\r\nproportion.\r\n\r\n[49] Any system of counting time which describes a date in such a manner\r\nthat it can not recur, satisfying all the necessary conditions, for 374,400\r\nyears, must be regarded as absolutely accurate in so far as the range of\r\nhuman life on this planet is concerned.\r\n\r\n[50] There are a very few monuments which have two Initial Series instead\r\nof one. So far as the writer knows, only six monuments in the entire Maya\r\narea present this feature, namely, Stelæ F, D, E, and A at Quirigua, Stela\r\n17 at Tikal, and Stela 11 at Yaxchilan.\r\n\r\n[51] Refer to p. 64 and figure 23. It will be noted that the third tooth\r\n(i. e. day) after the one named 7 Akbal 11 Cumhu is 10 Cimi 14 Cumhu.\r\n\r\n[52] This method of dating does not seem to have been used with either\r\nuinal or kin period endings, probably because of the comparative frequency\r\nwith which any given date might occur at the end of either of these two\r\nperiods.\r\n\r\n[53] In Chapter IV it will be shown that two bars stand for the number 10.\r\nIt will be necessary to anticipate the discussion of Maya numerals there\r\npresented to the extent of stating that a bar represented 5 and a dot or\r\nball, 1. The varying combinations of these two elements gave the values up\r\nto 20.\r\n\r\n[54] The u kahlay katunob on which the historical summary given in Chapter\r\nI is based shows an absolutely uninterrupted sequence of katuns for more\r\nthan 1,100 years. See Brinton (1882 b: pp. 152-164). It is necessary to\r\nnote here a correction on p. 153 of that work. Doctor Brinton has omitted a\r\nKatun 8 Ahau from this u kahlay katunob, which is present in the Berendt\r\ncopy, and he has incorrectly assigned the abandonment of Chichen Itza to\r\nthe preceding katun, Katun 10 Ahau, whereas the Berendt copy shows this\r\nevent took place during the katun omitted, Katun 8 Ahau.\r\n\r\n[55] There are, of course, a few exceptions to this rule--that is, there\r\nare some monuments which indicate an interval of more than 3,000 years\r\nbetween the extreme dates. In such cases, however, this interval is not\r\ndivided into katuns, nor in fact into any regularly recurring smaller unit,\r\nwith the single exception mentioned in footnote 1, p. 84.\r\n\r\n[56] On one monument, the tablet from the Temple of the Inscriptions at\r\nPalenque, there seems to be recorded a kind of u kahlay katunob; at least,\r\nthere is a sequence of ten consecutive katuns.\r\n\r\n[57] The word \"numeral,\" as used here, has been restricted to the first\r\ntwenty numbers, 0 to 19, inclusive.\r\n\r\n[58] See p. 96, footnote 1.\r\n\r\n[59] In one case, on the west side of Stela E at Quirigua, the number 14 is\r\nalso shown with an ornamental element (). This is very unusual and, so far\r\nas the writer knows, is the only example of its kind. The four dots in the\r\nnumbers 4, 9, 14, and 19 never appear thus separated in any other text\r\nknown.\r\n\r\n[60] In the examples given the numerical coefficients are attached as\r\nprefixes to the katun sign. Frequently, however, they occur as superfixes.\r\nIn such cases, however, the above observations apply equally well.\r\n\r\n[61] Care should be taken to distinguish the number or figure 20 from any\r\nperiod which contained 20 periods of the order next below it; otherwise the\r\nuinal, katun, and cycle glyphs could all be construed as signs for 20,\r\nsince each of these periods contains 20 units of the period next lower.\r\n\r\n[62] The Maya numbered by relative position from bottom to top, as will be\r\npresently explained.\r\n\r\n[63] This form of zero is always red and is used with black bar and dot\r\nnumerals as well as with red in the codices.\r\n\r\n[64] It is interesting to note in this connection that the Zapotec made use\r\nof the same outline in graphic representations of the tonalamatl. On page 1\r\nof the Zapotec Codex Féjerváry-Mayer an outline formed by the 260 days of\r\nthe tonalamatl exactly like the one in fig. 48, _a_, is shown.\r\n\r\n[65] This form of zero has been found only in the Dresden Codex. Its\r\nabsence from the other two codices is doubtless due to the fact that the\r\nmonth glyphs are recorded only a very few times in them--but once in the\r\nCodex Tro-Cortesiano and three times in the Codex Peresianus.\r\n\r\n[66] The forms shown attached to these numerals are those of the day and\r\nmonth signs (see figs. 16, 17, and 19, 20, respectively), and of the period\r\nglyphs (see figs. 25-35, inclusive). Reference to these figures will\r\nexplain the English translation in the case of any form which the student\r\nmay not remember.\r\n\r\n[67] The following possible exceptions, however, should be noted: In the\r\nCodex Peresianus the normal form of the tun sign sometimes occurs attached\r\nto varying heads, as (). Whether these heads denote numerals is unknown,\r\nbut the construction of this glyph in such cases (a head attached to the\r\nsign of a time period) absolutely parallels the use of head-variant\r\nnumerals with time-period glyphs in the inscriptions. A much stronger\r\nexample of the possible use of head numerals with period glyphs in the\r\ncodices, however, is found in the Dresden Codex. Here the accompanying head\r\n() is almost surely that for the number 16, the hatchet eye denoting 6 and\r\nthe fleshless lower jaw 10. Compare (+) with fig. 53, _f-i_, where the head\r\nfor 16 is shown. The glyph () here shown is the normal form for the kin\r\nsign. Compare fig. 34, b. The meaning of these two forms would thus seem to\r\nbe 16 kins. In the passage in which these glyphs occur the glyph next\r\npreceding the head for 16 is \"8 tuns,\" the numerical coefficient 8 being\r\nexpressed by one bar and three dots. It seems reasonably clear here,\r\ntherefore, that the form in question is a head numeral. However, these\r\ncases are so very rare and the context where they occur is so little\r\nunderstood, that they have been excluded in the general consideration of\r\nhead-variant numerals presented above.\r\n\r\n[68] It will appear presently that the number 13 could be expressed in two\r\ndifferent ways: (1) by a special head meaning 13, and (2) by the essential\r\ncharacteristic of the head for 10 applied to the head for 3 (i. e., 10 + 3\r\n= 13).\r\n\r\n[69] For the discussion of Initial Series in cycles other than Cycle 9, see\r\npp. 194-207.\r\n\r\n[70] The subfixial element in the first three forms of fig. 54 does not\r\nseem to be essential, since it is wanting in the last.\r\n\r\n[71] As previously explained, the number 20 is used only in the codices and\r\nthere only in connection with tonalamatls.\r\n\r\n[72] Whether the Maya used their numerical system in the inscriptions and\r\ncodices for counting anything besides time is not known. As used in the\r\ntexts, the numbers occur only in connection with calendric matters, at\r\nleast in so far as they have been deciphered. It is true many numbers are\r\nfound in both the inscriptions and codices which are attached to signs of\r\nunknown meaning, and it is possible that these may have nothing to do with\r\nthe calendar. An enumeration of cities or towns, or of tribute rolls, for\r\nexample, may be recorded in some of these places. Both of these subjects\r\nare treated of in the Aztec manuscripts and may well be present in Maya\r\ntexts.\r\n\r\n[73] The numerals and periods given in fig. 56 are expressed by their\r\nnormal forms in every case, since these may be more readily recognized than\r\nthe corresponding head variants, and consequently entail less work for the\r\nstudent. It should be borne in mind, however, that any bar and dot numeral\r\nor any period in fig. 56 could be expressed equally well by its\r\ncorresponding head form without affecting in the least the values of the\r\nresulting numbers.\r\n\r\n[74] There may be three other numbers in the inscriptions which are\r\nconsiderably higher (see pp. 114-127).\r\n\r\n[75] These are: (1) The tablet from the Temple of the Cross at Palenque;\r\n(2) Altar 1 at Piedras Negras; and (3) The east side of Stela C at\r\nQuirigua.\r\n\r\n[76] This case occurs on the tablet from the Temple of the Foliated Cross\r\nat Palenque.\r\n\r\n[77] It seems probable that the number on the north side of Stela C at\r\nCopan was not counted from the date 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu. The writer has not been\r\nable to satisfy himself, however, that this number is an Initial Series.\r\n\r\n[78] Mr. Bowditch (1910: pp. 41-42) notes a seeming exception to this, not\r\nin the inscription, however, but in the Dresden Codex, in which, in a\r\nseries of numbers on pp. 71-73, the number 390 is written 19 uinals and 10\r\nkins, instead of 1 tun, 1 uinal, and 10 kins.\r\n\r\n[79] That it was a Cycle 13 is shown from the fact that it was just 13\r\ncycles in advance of Cycle 13 ending on the date 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu.\r\n\r\n[80] See p. 156 and fig. 66 for method of designating the individual glyphs\r\nin a text.\r\n\r\n[81] The kins are missing from this number (see A9, fig. 60). At the\r\nmaximum, however, they could increase this large number only by 19. They\r\nhave been used here as at 0.\r\n\r\n[82] As will be explained presently, the kin sign is frequently omitted and\r\nits coefficient attached to the uinal glyph. See p. 127.\r\n\r\n[83] Glyph A9 is missing but undoubtedly was the kin sign and coefficient.\r\n\r\n[84] The lowest period, the kin, is missing. See A9, fig. 60.\r\n\r\n[85] The use of the word \"generally\" seems reasonable here; these three\r\ntexts come from widely separated centers--Copan in the extreme southeast,\r\nPalenque in the extreme west, and Tikal in the central part of the area.\r\n\r\n[86] A few exceptions to this have been noted on pp. 127, 128.\r\n\r\n[87] The Books of Chilan Balam have been included here as they are also\r\nexpressions of the native Maya mind.\r\n\r\n[88] This excludes, of course, the use of the numerals 1 to 13, inclusive,\r\nin the day names, and in the numeration of the cycles; also the numerals 0\r\nto 19, inclusive, when used to denote the positions of the days in the\r\ndivisions of the year, and the position of any period in the division next\r\nhigher.\r\n\r\n[89] Various methods and tables have been devised to avoid the necessity of\r\nreducing the higher terms of Maya numbers to units of the first order. Of\r\nthe former, that suggested by Mr. Bowditch (1910: pp. 302-309) is probably\r\nthe most serviceable. Of the tables Mr. Goodman's Archæic Annual Calendar\r\nand Archæic Chronological Calendar (1897) are by far the best. By using\r\neither of the above the necessity of reducing the higher terms to units of\r\nthe first order is obviated. On the other hand, the processes by means of\r\nwhich this is achieved in each case are far more complicated and less easy\r\nof comprehension than those of the method followed in this book, a method\r\nwhich from its simplicity might be termed perhaps the logical way, since it\r\nreduces all quantities to a primary unit, which is the same as the primary\r\nunit of the Maya calendar. This method was first devised by Prof. Ernst\r\nFörstemann, and has the advantage of being the most readily understood by\r\nthe beginner, sufficient reason for its use in this book.\r\n\r\n[90] This number is formed on the basis of 20 cycles to a great cycle\r\n(20×144,000=2,880,000). The writer assumes that he has established the fact\r\nthat 20 cycles were required to make 1 great cycle, in the inscriptions as\r\nwell as in the codices.\r\n\r\n[91] This is true in spite of the fact that in the codices the starting\r\npoints frequently appear to follow--that is, they stand below--the numbers\r\nwhich are counted from them. In reality such cases are perfectly regular\r\nand conform to this rule, because there the order is not from top to bottom\r\nbut from bottom to top, and, therefore, when read in this direction the\r\ndates come first.\r\n\r\n[92] These intervening glyphs the writer believes, as stated in Chapter II,\r\nare those which tell the real story of the inscriptions.\r\n\r\n[93] Only two exceptions to this rule have been noted throughout the Maya\r\nterritory: (1) The Initial Series on the east side of Stela C at Quirigua,\r\nand (2) the tablet from the Temple of the Cross at Palenque. It has been\r\nexplained that both of these Initial Series are counted from the date 4\r\nAhau 8 Zotz.\r\n\r\n[94] In the inscriptions an Initial Series may always be identified by the\r\nso-called introducing glyph (see fig. 24) which invariably precedes it.\r\n\r\n[95] Professor Förstemann has pointed out a few cases in the Dresden Codex\r\nin which, although the count is backward, the special character indicating\r\nthe fact is wanting (fig. 64). (See _Bulletin_ 28, p. 401.)\r\n\r\n[96] There are a few cases in which the \"backward sign\" includes also the\r\nnumeral in the second position.\r\n\r\n[97] In the text wherein this number is found the date 4 Ahau 8 Camhu\r\nstands below the lowest term.\r\n\r\n[98] It should be noted here that in the _u kahlay katunob_ also, from the\r\nBooks of Chilan Balam, the count is always forward.\r\n\r\n[99] For transcribing the Maya numerical notation into the characters of\r\nour own Arabic notation Maya students have adopted the practice of writing\r\nthe various terms from left to right in a _descending_ series, as the units\r\nof our decimal system are written. For example, 4 katuns, 8 tuns, 3 uinals,\r\nand 1 kin are written 4.8.3.1; and 9 cycles, 16 katuns, 1 tun, 0 uinal, and\r\n0 kins are written 9.16.1.0.0. According to this method, the highest term\r\nin each number is written on the left, the next lower on its right, the\r\nnext lower on the right of that, and so on down through the units of the\r\nfirst, or lowest, order. This notation is very convenient for transcribing\r\nthe Maya numbers and will be followed hereafter.\r\n\r\n[100] The reason for rejecting all parts of the quotient except the\r\nnumerator of the fractional part is that this part alone shows the actual\r\nnumber of units which have to be counted either forward or backward, as the\r\ncount may be, in order to reach the number which exactly uses up or\r\nfinishes the dividend--the last unit of the number which has to be counted.\r\n\r\n[101] The student can prove this point for himself by turning to the\r\ntonalamatl wheel in pl. 5; after selecting any particular day, as 1 Ik for\r\nexample, proceed to count 260 days from this day as a starting point, in\r\neither direction around the wheel. No matter in which direction he has\r\ncounted, whether beginning with 13 Imix or 2 Akbal, the 260th day will be 1\r\nIk again.\r\n\r\n[102] The student may prove this for himself by reducing 9.0.0.0.0 to days\r\n(1,296,000), and counting forward this number from the date 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu,\r\nas described in the rules on pages 138-143. The terminal date reached will\r\nbe 8 Ahau 13 Ceh, as given above.\r\n\r\n[103] Numbers may also be added to or subtracted from Period-ending dates,\r\nsince the positions of such dates are also fixed in the Long Count, and\r\nconsequently may be used as bases of reference for dates whose positions in\r\nthe Long Count are not recorded.\r\n\r\n[104] In adding two Maya numbers, for example 9.12.2.0.16 and 12.9.5, care\r\nshould be taken first to arrange like units under like, as:\r\n\r\n  9.12. 2. 0.16\r\n       12. 9. 5\r\n  -------------\r\n  9.12.14.10. 1\r\n\r\nNext, beginning at the right, the kins or units of the 1st place are added\r\ntogether, and after all the 20s (here 1) have been deducted from this sum,\r\nplace the remainder (here 1) in the kin place. Next add the uinals, or\r\nunits of the 2d place, adding to them 1 for each 20 which was carried\r\nforward from the 1st place. After all the 18s possible have been deducted\r\nfrom this sum (here 0) place the remainder (here 10) in the uinal place.\r\nNext add the tuns, or units of the 3d place, adding to them 1 for each 18\r\nwhich was carried forward from the 2d place, and after deducting all the\r\n20s possible (here 0) place the remainder (here 14) in the tun place.\r\nProceed in this manner until the highest units present have been added and\r\nwritten below.\r\n\r\nSubtraction is just the reverse of the preceding. Using the same numbers:\r\n\r\n  9.12. 2.0.16\r\n       12.9. 5\r\n  ------------\r\n  9.11. 9.9.11\r\n\r\n5 kins from 16 = 11; 9 uinals from 18 uinals (1 tun has to be borrowed) =\r\n9; 12 tuns from 21 tuns (1 katun has to be borrowed, which, added to the 1\r\ntun left in the minuend, makes 21 tuns) = 9 tuns; 0 katuns from 11 katuns\r\n(1 katun having been borrowed) = 11 katuns; and 0 cycles from 9 cycles = 9\r\ncycles.\r\n\r\n[105] The Supplementary Series present perhaps the most promising field for\r\nfuture study and investigation in the Maya texts. They clearly have to do\r\nwith a numerical count of some kind, which of itself should greatly\r\nfacilitate progress in their interpretation. Mr. Goodman (1897: p. 118) has\r\nsuggested that in some way the Supplementary Series record the dates of the\r\nInitial Series they accompany according to some other and unknown method,\r\nthough he offers no proof in support of this hypothesis. Mr. Bowditch\r\n(1910: p. 244) believes they probably relate to time, because the glyphs of\r\nwhich they are composed have numbers attached to them. He has suggested the\r\nname Supplementary Series by which they are known, implying in the\r\ndesignation that these Series in some way supplement or complete the\r\nmeaning of the Initial Series with which they are so closely connected. The\r\nwriter believes that they treat of some lunar count. It seems almost\r\ncertain that the moon glyph occurs repeatedly in the Supplementary Series\r\n(see fig. 65).\r\n\r\n[106] The word \"closing\" as used here means only that in reading from left\r\nto right and from top to bottom--that is, in the normal order--the sign\r\nshown in fig. 65 is always the last one in the Supplementary Series,\r\nusually standing immediately before the month glyph of the Initial-series\r\nterminal date. It does not signify, however, that the Supplementary Series\r\nwere to be read in this direction, and, indeed, there are strong\r\nindications that they followed the reverse order, from right to left and\r\nbottom to top.\r\n\r\n[107] In a few cases the sign shown in fig. 65 occurs elsewhere in the\r\nSupplementary Series than as its \"closing\" glyph. In such cases its\r\ncoefficient is not restricted to the number 9 or 10.\r\n\r\n[108] In the codices frequently the month parts of dates are omitted and\r\nstarting points and terminal dates alike are expressed as days only; thus,\r\n2 Ahau, 5 Imix, 7 Kan, etc. This is nearly always the case in tonalamatls\r\nand in certain series of numbers in the Dresden Codex.\r\n\r\n[109] Only a very few month signs seem to be recorded in the Codex\r\nTro-Cortesiano and the Codex Peresianus. The Tro-Cortesiano has only one\r\n(p. 73b), in which the date 13 Ahau 13 Cumhu is recorded thus (). Compare\r\nthe month form in this date with fig. 20, _z-b'_. Mr. Gates (1910: p. 21)\r\nfinds three month signs in the Codex Peresianus, on pp. 4, 7, and 18 at\r\n4c7, 7c2, and 18b4, respectively. The first of these is 16 Zac (). Compare\r\nthis form with fig. 20, _o_. The second is 1 Yaxkin (+). Compare this form\r\nwith fig. 20, _i-j_. The third is 12 Cumhu (++); see fig. 20, _z-b'_.\r\n\r\n[110] As used throughout this work, the word \"inscriptions\" is applied only\r\nto texts from the monuments.\r\n\r\n[111] The term glyph-block has been used instead of glyph in this\r\nconnection because in many inscriptions several different glyphs are\r\nincluded in one glyph-block. In such cases, however, the glyphs within the\r\nglyph-block follow precisely the same order as the glyph-blocks themselves\r\nfollow in the pairs of columns, that is, from left to right and top to\r\nbottom.\r\n\r\n[112] Initial Series which have all their period glyphs expressed by normal\r\nforms are comparatively rare; consequently the four examples presented in\r\npl. 6, although they are the best of their kind, leave something to be\r\ndesired in other ways. In pl. 6, _A_, for example, the month sign was\r\npartially effaced though it is restored in the accompanying reproduction;\r\nin _B_ of the same plate the closing glyph of the Supplementary Series (the\r\nmonth-sign indicator) is wanting, although the month sign itself is very\r\nclear. Again, in _D_ the details of the day glyph and month glyph are\r\npartially effaced (restored in the reproduction), and in _C_, although the\r\nentire text is very clear, the month sign of the terminal date irregularly\r\nfollows immediately the day sign. However, in spite of these slight\r\nirregularities, it has seemed best to present these particular texts as the\r\nfirst examples of Initial Series, because their period glyphs are expressed\r\nby normal forms exclusively, which, as pointed out above, are more easily\r\nrecognized on account of their greater differentiation than the\r\ncorresponding head variants.\r\n\r\n[113] In most of the examples presented in this chapter the full\r\ninscription is not shown, only that part of the text illustrating the\r\nparticular point in question being given. For this reason reference will be\r\nmade in each case to the publication in which the entire inscription has\r\nbeen reproduced. The full text on Zoömorph P at Quirigua will be found in\r\nMaudslay, 1889-1902: II, pls. 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 59, 63, 64.\r\n\r\n[114] All glyphs expressed in this way are to be understood as inclusive.\r\nThus A1-B2 signifies 4 glyphs, namely, A1, B1, A2, B2,\r\n\r\n[115] The introducing glyph, so far as the writer knows, always stands at\r\nthe beginning of an inscription, or in the second glyph-block, that is, at\r\nthe top. Hence an Initial Series can never precede it.\r\n\r\n[116] The Initial Series on Stela 10 at Tikal is the only exception known.\r\nSee pp. 123-127.\r\n\r\n[117] As will appear in the following examples, nearly all Initial Series\r\nhave 9 as their cycle coefficient.\r\n\r\n[118] In the present case therefore so far as these calculations are\r\nconcerned, 3,900 is the equivalent of 1,427,400.\r\n\r\n[119] It should be remembered in this connection, as explained on pp. 47,\r\n55, that the positions in the divisions of the year which the Maya called\r\n3, 8, 13, and 18 correspond in our method of naming the positions of the\r\ndays in the months to the 4th, 9th, 14th, and 19th positions, respectively.\r\n\r\n[120] As stated in footnote 1, p. 152, the meaning of the Supplementary\r\nSeries has not yet been worked out.\r\n\r\n[121] The reasons which have led the writer to this conclusion are given at\r\nsome length on pp. 33-36.\r\n\r\n[122] For the full text of this inscription see Maler, 1908 b: pl. 36.\r\n\r\n[123] Since nothing but Initial-series texts will be presented in the\r\nplates and figures immediately following, a fact which the student will\r\nreadily detect by the presence of the introducing glyph at the head of each\r\ntext, it is unnecessary to repeat for each new text step 2 (p. 135) and\r\nstep 3 (p. 136), which explain how to determine the starting point of the\r\ncount and the direction of the count, respectively; and the student may\r\nassume that the starting point of the several Initial Series hereinafter\r\nfigured will always be the date 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu and that the direction of\r\nthe count will always be forward.\r\n\r\n[124] As will appear later, in connection with the discussion of the\r\nSecondary Series, the Initial-series date of a monument does not always\r\ncorrespond with the ending date of the period whose close the monument\r\nmarks. In other words, the Initial-series date is not always the date\r\ncontemporaneous with the formal dedication of the monument as a\r\ntime-marker. This point will appear much more clearly when the function of\r\nSecondary Series has been explained.\r\n\r\n[125] For the full text of this inscription see Hewett, 1911: pl. XXXV _C_.\r\n\r\n[126] So far as the writer knows, the existence of a period containing 5\r\ntuns has not been suggested heretofore. The very general practice of\r\nclosing inscriptions with the end of some particular 5-tun period in the\r\nLong Count, as 9.18.5.0.0, or 9.18.10.0.0, or 9.18.15.0.0, or 9.19.0.0.0,\r\nfor example, seems to indicate that this period was the unit used for\r\nmeasuring time in Maya chronological records, at least in the southern\r\ncities. Consequently, it seems likely that there was a special glyph to\r\nexpress this unit.\r\n\r\n[127] For the full text of this inscription see Maler, 1908 b: pl. 39.\r\n\r\n[128] The student should note that from this point steps 2 (p. 139) and 3\r\n(p. 140) have been omitted in discussing each text (see p. 162, footnote\r\n3).\r\n\r\n[129] In each of the above cases--and, indeed, in all the examples\r\nfollowing--the student should perform the various calculations by which the\r\nresults are reached, in order to familiarize himself with the workings of\r\nthe Maya chronological system.\r\n\r\n[130] The student may apply a check at this point to his identification of\r\nthe day sign in A4 as being that for the day Eb. Since the month\r\ncoefficient in A7 is surely 10 (2 bars), it is clear from Table VII that\r\nthe only days which can occupy this position in any division of the year\r\nare Ik, Manik, Eb, and Caban. Now, by comparing the sign in A4 with the\r\nsigns for Ik, Manik, and Caban, _c, j_, and _a', b'_, respectively, of fig.\r\n16, it is very evident that A4 bears no resemblance to any of them; hence,\r\nsince Eb is the only one left which can occupy a position 10, the day sign\r\nin A4 must be Eb, a fact supported by the comparison of A4 with fig. 16,\r\n_s-u_, above.\r\n\r\n[131] The full text of this inscription will be found in Maudslay,\r\n1889-1901: I, pls. 35-37.\r\n\r\n[132] The full text of this inscription is given in Maudslay, 1889-1902: I,\r\npls. 27-30.\r\n\r\n[133] Note the decoration on the numerical bar.\r\n\r\n[134] So far as known to the writer, this very unusual variant for the\r\nclosing glyph of the Supplementary Series occurs in but two other\r\ninscriptions in the Maya territory, namely, on Stela N at Copan. See pl.\r\n26, Glyph A14, and Inscription 6 of the Hieroglyphic Stairway at Naranjo,\r\nGlyph A1 (?). (Maler, 1908 b: pl. 27.)\r\n\r\n[135] For the full text of this inscription see Maudslay, 1889-1902: I,\r\npls. 105-107.\r\n\r\n[136] In this glyph-block, A4, the order of reading is irregular; instead\r\nof passing over to B4a after reading A4a (the 10 tuns), the next glyph to\r\nbe read is the sign below A4a, A4b, which records 0 uinals, and only after\r\nthis has been read does B4a follow.\r\n\r\n[137] Texts illustrating the head-variant numerals in full will be\r\npresented later.\r\n\r\n[138] The preceding hotun ended with the day 9.12.5.0.0 3 Ahau 3 Xul and\r\ntherefore the opening day of the next hotun, 1 day later, will be\r\n9.12.5.0.1 4 Imix 4 Xul.\r\n\r\n[139] For the full text of this inscription, see Maudslay, 1889-1902: I,\r\npls. 109, 110.\r\n\r\n[140] The oldest Initial Series at Copan is recorded on Stela 15, which is\r\n40 years older than Stela 9. For a discussion of this text see pp. 187,\r\n188.\r\n\r\n[141] An exception to this statement should be noted in an Initial Series\r\non the Hieroglyphic Stairway, which records the date 9.5.19.3.0 8 Ahau 3\r\nZotz. The above remark applies only to the large monuments, which, the\r\nwriter believes, were period-markers. Stela 9 is therefore the next to the\r\noldest \"period stone\" yet discovered at Copan. It is more than likely,\r\nhowever, that there are several older ones as yet undeciphered.\r\n\r\n[142] For the full text of this inscription, see Maudslay, 1889-1902: II,\r\npls. 17-19.\r\n\r\n[143] Although this date is considerably older than that on Stela 9 at\r\nCopan, its several glyphs present none of the marks of antiquity noted in\r\nconnection with the preceding example (pl. 8, _B_). For example, the ends\r\nof the bars denoting 5 are not square but round, and the head-variant\r\nperiod glyphs do not show the same elaborate and ornate treatment as in the\r\nCopan text. This apparent contradiction permits of an easy explanation.\r\nAlthough the Initial Series on the west side of Stela C at Quirigua\r\nundoubtedly refers to an earlier date than the Initial Series on the Copan\r\nmonument, it does not follow that the Quirigua monument is the older of the\r\ntwo. This is true because on the other side of this same stela at Quirigua\r\nis recorded another date, 9.17.5.0.0 6 Ahau 13 Kayab, more than three\r\nhundred years later than the Initial Series 9.1.0.0.0 6 Ahau 13 Yaxkin on\r\nthe west side, and this later date is doubtless the one which referred to\r\npresent time when this monument was erected. Therefore the Initial Series\r\n9.1.0.0.0 6 Ahau 13 Yaxkin does not represent the period which Stela C was\r\nerected to mark, but some far earlier date in Maya history.\r\n\r\n[144] For the full text of this inscription see Maudslay, 1889-1902: I, pl.\r\n74.\r\n\r\n[145] For the full text of this inscription see Maler, 1903: II, No. 2,\r\npls. 74, 75.\r\n\r\n[146] For the full text of this inscription see Maler, 1903: II, No. 2, pl.\r\n79, 2.\r\n\r\n[147] For the full text of this inscription see Maler, 1911: V, No. 1, pl.\r\n15.\r\n\r\n[148] As used throughout this book, the expression \"the contemporaneous\r\ndate\" designates the time when the monument on which such a date is found\r\nwas put into formal use, that is, the time of its erection. As will appear\r\nlater in the discussion of the Secondary Series, many monuments present\r\nseveral dates between the extremes of which elapse long periods. Obviously,\r\nonly one of the dates thus recorded can represent the time at which the\r\nmonument was erected. In such inscriptions the final date is almost\r\ninvariably the one designating contemporaneous time, and the earlier dates\r\nrefer probably to historical, traditional, or even mythological events in\r\nthe Maya past. Thus the Initial Series 9.0.19.2.4 2 Kan 2 Yax on Lintel 21\r\nat Yaxchilan, 9.1.0.0.0 6 Ahau 13 Yazkin on the west side of Stela C at\r\nQuirigua, and 9.4.0.0.0 13 Ahau 18 Yax from the Temple of the Inscriptions\r\nat Palenque, all refer probably to earlier historical or traditional events\r\nin the past of these three cities, but they do not indicate the dates at\r\nwhich they were severally recorded. As Initial Series which refer to purely\r\nmythological events may be classed the Initial Series from the Temples of\r\nthe Sun, Cross, and Foliated Cross at Palenque, and from the east side of\r\nStela C at Quirigua, all of which are concerned with dates centering around\r\nor at the beginning of Maya chronology. Stela 3 at Tikal (the text here\r\nunder discussion), on the other hand, has but one date, which probably\r\nrefers to the time of its erection, and is therefore contemporaneous.\r\n\r\n[149] There are one or two earlier Initial Series which probably record\r\ncontemporaneous dates; these are not inscribed on large stone monuments but\r\non smaller antiquities, namely, the Tuxtla Statuette and the Leyden Plate.\r\nFor the discussion of these early contemporaneous Initial Series, see pp.\r\n194-198.\r\n\r\n[150] For the full text of this inscription see Maudslay, 1889-1902: II,\r\npls. 4-7.\r\n\r\n[151] For the full text of this inscription see Maudslay, 1889-1902: IV,\r\npls. 80-82.\r\n\r\n[152] As explained on p. 179, footnote 1, this Initial Series refers\r\nprobably to some mythological event rather than to any historical\r\noccurrence. The date here recorded precedes the historic period of the Maya\r\ncivilization by upward of 3,000 years.\r\n\r\n[153] For the full text of this inscription see Maudslay, 1889-1902; IV,\r\npls. 87-89.\r\n\r\n[154] For the full text of this inscription, see Maudslay, 1889-1902: IV,\r\npl. 23.\r\n\r\n[155] It is clear that if all the period coefficients above the kin have\r\nbeen correctly identified, even though the kin coefficient is unknown, by\r\ndesignating it 0 the date reached will be within 19 days of the date\r\noriginally recorded. Even though its maximum value (19) had originally been\r\nrecorded here, it could have carried the count only 19 days further. By\r\nusing 0 as the kin coefficient, therefore, we can not be more than 19 days\r\nfrom the original date.\r\n\r\n[156] For the full text of this inscription see Maudslay, 1889-1902: I,\r\npls. 88, 89.\r\n\r\n[157] While at Copan the writer made a personal examination of this\r\nmonument and found that Mr. Maudslay's drawing is incorrect as regards the\r\ncoefficient of the day sign. The original has two numerical dots between\r\ntwo crescents, whereas the Maudslay drawing shows one numerical dot between\r\ntwo distinct pairs of crescents, each pair, however, of different shape.\r\n\r\n[158] For the full text of this inscription see Maudslay, 1889-1902: II,\r\npls. 41-44.\r\n\r\n[159] For the text of this monument see Spinden, 1913: VI, pl. 23, 2.\r\n\r\n[160] For the discussion of full-figure glyphs, see pp. 65-73.\r\n\r\n[161] The characteristics of the heads for 7, 14, 16, and 19 will be found\r\nin the heads for 17, 4, 6, and 9, respectively.\r\n\r\n[162] For the full text of this inscription see Maudslay, 1889-1902: I,\r\npls. 47, 48.\r\n\r\n[163] The student will note also in connection with this glyph that the\r\npair of comblike appendages usually found are here replaced by a pair of\r\nfishes. As explained on pp. 65-66, the fish represents probably the\r\noriginal form from which the comblike element was derived in the process of\r\nglyph conventionalization. The full original form of this element is\r\ntherefore in keeping with the other full-figure forms in this text.\r\n\r\n[164] For the full text of this inscription, see Maudslay, 1889-1902: I,\r\npls. 66-71.\r\n\r\n[165] The student should remember that in this diagonal the direction of\r\nreading is from bottom to top. See pl. 15, _B_, glyphs 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,\r\netc. Consequently the upper half of 13 follows the lower half in this\r\nparticular glyph.\r\n\r\n[166] For the full text of this inscription see Hewett, 1911: pl. XXII _B_.\r\n\r\n[167] A few monuments at Quirigua, namely, Stelæ F, D, E, and A, have two\r\nInitial Series each. In A both of the Initial Series have 0 for the\r\ncoefficients of their uinal and kin glyphs, and in F, D, E, the Initial\r\nSeries which shows the position of the monument in the Long Count, that is,\r\nthe Initial Series showing the katun ending which it marks, has 0 for its\r\nuinal and kin coefficients.\r\n\r\n[168] In 1913 Mr. M. D. Landry, superintendent of the Quirigua district,\r\nGuatemala division of the United Fruit Co., found a still earlier monument\r\nabout half a mile west of the main group. This has been named Stela S. It\r\nrecords the katun ending prior to the one on Stela H, i. e., 9.15.15.0.0 9\r\nAhau 18 Xul.\r\n\r\n[169] For the full text of this inscription see Holmes, 1907: pp. 691 et\r\nseq., and pls. 34-41.\r\n\r\n[170] For a full discussion of the Tuxtla Statuette, including the opinions\r\nof several writers as to its inscription, see Holmes, 1907: pp. 691 et seq.\r\nThe present writer gives therein at some length the reasons which have led\r\nhim to accept this inscription as genuine and contemporaneous.\r\n\r\n[171] For the full text of these inscriptions, see Seler, 1902-1908: II,\r\n253, and 1901 c: I, 23, fig. 7. During his last visit to the Maya territory\r\nthe writer discovered that Stela 11 at Tikal has a Cycle-10 Initial Series,\r\nnamely, 10.2.0.0.0. 3 Ahau 3 Ceh.\r\n\r\n[172] Missing.\r\n\r\n[173] At Seibal a Period-ending date 10.1.0.0.0 5 Ahau 3 Kayab is clearly\r\nrecorded, but this is some 30 years earlier than either of the Initial\r\nSeries here under discussion, a significant period just at this particular\r\nepoch of Maya history, which we have every reason to believe was filled\r\nwith stirring events and quickly shifting scenes. Tikal, with the Initial\r\nSeries 10.2.0.0.0 3 Ahau 3 Ceh, and Seibal with the same date (not as an\r\nInitial Series, however) are the nearest, though even these fall 10 years\r\nshort of the Quen Santo and Chichen Itza Initial Series.\r\n\r\n[174] Up to the present time no successful interpretation of the\r\ninscription on Stela C at Copan has been advanced. The inscription on each\r\nside of this monument is headed by an introducing glyph, but in neither\r\ncase is this followed by an Initial Series. A number consisting of\r\n11.14.5.1.0 is recorded in connection with the date 6 Ahau 18 Kayab, but as\r\nthis date does not appear to be fixed in the Long Count, there is no way of\r\nascertaining whether it is earlier or later than the starting point of Maya\r\nchronology. Mr. Bowditch (1910: pp. 195-196) offers an interesting\r\nexplanation of this monument, to which the student is referred for the\r\npossible explanation of this text. A personal inspection of this\r\ninscription failed to confirm, however, the assumption on which Mr.\r\nBowditch's conclusions rest. For the full text of this inscription, see\r\nMaudslay, 1889-1902: I, pls. 39-41.\r\n\r\n[175] For the full text of this inscription, see ibid.: II, pls. 16, 17,\r\n19.\r\n\r\n[176] Table XVI contains only 80 Calendar Rounds (1,518,400), but by adding\r\n18 Calendar Rounds (341,640) the number to be subtracted, 98 Calendar\r\nRounds (1,860,040), will be reached.\r\n\r\n[177] Counting 13.0.0.0.0 backward from the starting point of Maya\r\nchronology, 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu, gives the date 4 Ahau 8 Zotz, which is no\r\nnearer the terminal date recorded in B5-A6 than the date 4 Ahau 3 Kankin\r\nreached by counting forward.\r\n\r\n[178] For the full text of this inscription, see Maudslay, 1889-1902: IV,\r\npls. 73-77.\r\n\r\n[179] As noted in Chapter IV, this is one of the only two heads for 13\r\nfound in the inscriptions which is composed of the essential element of the\r\n10 head applied to the 3 head, the combination of the two giving 13.\r\nUsually the head for 13 is represented by a form peculiar to this number\r\nalone and is not built up by the combination of lower numbers as in this\r\ncase.\r\n\r\n[180] Although at first sight the headdress resembles the tun sign, a\r\ncloser examination shows that it is not this element.\r\n\r\n[181] Similarly, it could be shown that the use of every other possible\r\nvalue of the cycle coefficient will not give the terminal date actually\r\nrecorded.\r\n\r\n[182] For the full text of this inscription see Maler, 1903: II, No. 2, pl.\r\n56.\r\n\r\n[183] From this point on this step will be omitted, but the student is\r\nurged to perform the calculations necessary in each case to reach the\r\nterminal dates recorded.\r\n\r\n[184] Since the introducing glyph always accompanies an Initial Series, it\r\nhas here been included as a part of it, though, as has been explained\r\nelsewhere, its function is unknown.\r\n\r\n[185] The number 15.1.16.5 is equal to 108,685 days, or 297½ years.\r\n\r\n[186] It is interesting to note in this connection that the date 9.16.1.0.0\r\n11 Ahau 8 Tzec, which is within 9 days of 9.16.1.0.9 7 Muluc 17 Tzec, is\r\nrecorded in four different inscriptions at Yaxchilan, one of which (see pl.\r\n9, _A_) has already been figured.\r\n\r\n[187] For the full text of this inscription see Maler, 1901: II, No. 1, pl.\r\n12.\r\n\r\n[188] The month-sign indicator appears in B2 with a coefficient 10.\r\n\r\n[189] Not expressed.\r\n\r\n[190] The writer has recently established the date of this monument as\r\n9.13.15.0.0 13 Ahau 18 Pax, or 99 days later than the above date.\r\n\r\n[191] For the full text of this inscription, see Maudslay, 1889-1902: II,\r\npls. 47-49.\r\n\r\n[192] Although the details of the day and month signs are somewhat effaced,\r\nthe coefficient in each case is 3, agreeing with the coefficients in the\r\nInitial-series terminal date, and the outline of the month glyph suggests\r\nthat it is probably Yax. See fig. 19, _q, r_.\r\n\r\n[193] Since the Maya New Year's day, 0 Pop, always fell on the 16th of\r\nJuly, the day 3 Yax always fell on Jan. 15th, at the commencement of the\r\ndry season.\r\n\r\n[194] Since 0 Pop fell on July 16th (Old Style), 18 Kayab fell on June\r\n19th, which is very near the summer solstice, that is, the seeming northern\r\nlimit of the sun, and roughly coincident with the beginning of the rainy\r\nseason at Quirigua.\r\n\r\n[195] For the full text of this inscription, see Maudslay, 1889-1902: II,\r\npl. 46.\r\n\r\n[196] Bracketed dates are those which are not actually recorded but which\r\nare reached by numbers appearing in the text.\r\n\r\n[197] Although not recorded, the number 1.14.6 is the distance from the\r\ndate 9.15.5.0.0 reached by the Secondary Series on one side to the starting\r\npoint of the Secondary Series on the other side, that is, 9.15.6.14.6 6\r\nCimi 4 Tzec.\r\n\r\n[198] For the full text of this inscription see Maudslay, 1889-1902: II,\r\npls. 37, 39, 40. For convenience in figuring, the lower parts of columns A\r\nand B are shown in _B_ instead of below the upper part. The numeration of\r\nthe glyph-blocks, however, follows the arrangement in the original.\r\n\r\n[199] This is one of the two Initial Series which justified the assumptions\r\nmade in the previous text that the date 12 Caban 5 Kayab, which was\r\nrecorded there, had the Initial-series value 9.14.13.4.17, as here.\r\n\r\n[200] This is the text in which the Initial-series value 9.15.6.14.6 was\r\nfound attached to the date 6 Cimi 4 Tzec.\r\n\r\n[201] For the full text of this inscription see Maudslay, 1889-1902: II,\r\npls. 38, 40.\r\n\r\n[202] The frontlet seems to be composed of but one element, indicating for\r\nthis head the value 8 instead of 1. However, as the calculations point to\r\n1, it is probable there was originally another element to the frontlet.\r\n\r\n[203] See Maudslay, 1889-1902: I, pl. 102, west side, glyphs A5b-A7a.\r\n\r\n[204] See ibid.: IV, pl. 81, glyphs N15 O15.\r\n\r\n[205] See Maler, 1908 b: IV, No. 2, pl. 38, east side, glyphs A17-B18.\r\n\r\n[206] See ibid., 1911: V, pl. 26, glyphs A1-A4.\r\n\r\n[207] See Maudslay, 1889-1902: I, pl. 104, glyphs A7, B7.\r\n\r\n[208] See Maudslay, 1889-1902: IV, pl. 60, glyphs M1-N2.\r\n\r\n[209] Maler, 1911: V, pl. 17, east side, glyphs A4-A5.\r\n\r\n[210] See Maudslay, 1889-1902: II, pl. 19, west side, glyphs B10-A12.\r\n\r\n[211] See Maudslay, 1889-1902: IV, pl. 75, glyphs D3-C5.\r\n\r\n[212] See Maler, 1901: II, No. 1, pl. 8, glyphs A1-A2.\r\n\r\n[213] See Maudslay, op. cit., pl. 81, glyphs C7-D8.\r\n\r\n[214] It will be remembered that Uayeb was the name for the _xma kaba kin_,\r\nthe 5 closing days of the year. Dates which fall in this period are\r\nexceedingly rare, and in the inscriptions, so far as the writer knows, have\r\nbeen found only at Palenque and Tikal.\r\n\r\n[215] See Maudslay, 1889-1902: IV, pl. 77, glyphs P14-R2. Glyphs Q15-P17\r\nare omitted from pl. 22, _G_, as they appear to be uncalendrical.\r\n\r\n[216] See Maudslay, 1889-1902: I, pl. 100, glyphs C1 D1, A2.\r\n\r\n[217] This excludes Stela C, which has two Initial Series (see figs. 68 and\r\n77), though neither of them, as explained on p. 175, footnote 1, records\r\nthe date of this monument. The true date of this monument is declared by\r\nthe Period-ending date figured in pl. 21, _H_, which is 9.17.0.0.0 6 Ahau\r\n13 Kayab. (See p. 226.)\r\n\r\n[218] See Maudslay, 1889-1902: II, pl. 44, west side, glyphs G4 H4, F5.\r\n\r\n[219] The dates 10.2.5.0.0 9 Ahau 18 Yax and 10.2.10.0.0 2 Ahau 13 Chen on\r\nStelæ 1 and 2, respectively, at Quen Santo, are purposely excluded from\r\nthis statement. Quen Santo is in the highlands of Guatemala (see pl. 1) and\r\nis well to the south of the Usamacintla region. It rose to prominence\r\nprobably after the collapse of the great southern cities and is to be\r\nconsidered as inaugurating a new order of things, if not indeed a new\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\n[220] See Maler, 1908 a: IV, No. 1, pl. 9, glyphs E2, F2, A3, and A4.\r\n\r\n[221] The student will note that the lower periods (the tun, uinal, and kin\r\nsigns) are omitted and consequently are to be considered as having the\r\ncoefficient 0.\r\n\r\n[222] The usual positions of the uinal and kin coefficients in D4a are\r\nreversed, the kin coefficient 10 standing above the uinal sign instead of\r\nat the left of it. The calculations show, however, that 10, not 11, is the\r\nkin coefficient.\r\n\r\n[223] In this number also the positions of the uinal and kin coefficients\r\nare reversed.\r\n\r\n[224] For the full text of this inscription, see Maudslay, 1889-1902: II,\r\npls. 28-32.\r\n\r\n[225] The student will note that 12, not 13, tuns are recorded in A5. As\r\nexplained elsewhere (see pp. 247, 248), this is an error on the part of the\r\nancient scribe who engraved this inscription. The correct tun coefficient\r\nis 13, as used above.\r\n\r\n[226] This Secondary-series number is doubly irregular. In the first place,\r\nthe kin and uinal coefficients are reversed, the latter standing to the\r\nleft of its sign instead of above, and in the second place, the uinal\r\ncoefficient, although it is 14, has an ornamental dot between the two\r\nmiddle dots.\r\n\r\n[227] Since we counted _backward_ 1.14.6 from 6 Cimi 4 Tzec to reach 10\r\nAhau 8 Chen, we must _subtract_ 1.14.6 from the Initial-series value of 6\r\nCimi 4 Tzec to reach the Initial-series value of 10 Ahau 8 Chen.\r\n\r\n[228] It is obvious that the kin and uinal coefficients are reversed in\r\nA17b since the coefficient above the uinal sign is very clearly 19, an\r\nimpossible value for the uinal coefficient in the inscriptions, 19 uinals\r\n_always_ being written 1 tun, 1 uinal. Therefore the 19 must be the kin\r\ncoefficient. See also p. 110, footnote 1.\r\n\r\n[229] The first glyph of the Supplementary Series, B6a, very irregularly\r\nstands between the kin period glyph and the day part of the terminal date.\r\n\r\n[230] Incorrectly recorded as 12. See pp. 247, 248.\r\n\r\n[231] In this table the numbers showing the distances have been omitted and\r\nall dates are shown in terms of their corresponding Initial-series numbers,\r\nin order to facilitate their comparison. The contemporaneous date of each\r\nmonument is given in bold-faced figures and capital letters, and the\r\nstudent will note also that this date not only ends a hotun in each case\r\nbut is, further, the latest date in each text.\r\n\r\n[232] The Initial Series on the west side of Stela D at Quirigua is\r\n9.16.13.4.17 8 Caban 5 Yaxkin, which was just 2 katuns later than\r\n9.14.13.4.17 12 Caban 5 Kayab, or, in other words, the second katun\r\nanniversary, if the term anniversary may be thus used, of the latter date.\r\n\r\n[233] For the full text of this inscription, see Maudslay, 1889-1902: II,\r\npl. 50.\r\n\r\n[234] For the full text of this inscription, see Maudslay, 1889-1902: I,\r\npl. 112.\r\n\r\n[235] Every fourth hotun ending in the Long Count was a katun ending at the\r\nsame time, namely:\r\n\r\n  9.16. 0.0.0     2 Ahau 13 Tzec\r\n  9.16. 5.0.0     8 Ahau  8 Zotz\r\n  9.16.10.0.0     1 Ahau  3 Zip\r\n  9.16.15.0.0     7 Ahau 18 Pop\r\n  9.17. 0.0.0    13 Ahau 18 Cumhu\r\n  etc.\r\n\r\n[236] Maler, 1911: No. 1, p. 40.\r\n\r\n[237] For a seeming exception to this statement, in the codices, see p.\r\n110, footnote 1.\r\n\r\n[238] That is, the age of one compared with the age of another, without\r\nreference to their actual age as expressed in terms of our own chronology.\r\n\r\n[239] See Chapter II for the discussion of this point and the quotations\r\nfrom contemporary authorities, both Spanish and native, on which the above\r\nstatement is based.\r\n\r\n[240] As explained on p. 31, tonalamatls were probably used by the priests\r\nin making prophecies or divinations. This, however, is a matter apart from\r\ntheir composition, that is, length, divisions, dates, and method of\r\ncounting, which more particularly concerns us here.\r\n\r\n[241] The codices are folded like a screen or fan, and when opened form a\r\ncontinuous strip sometimes several yards in length. As will appear later,\r\nin many cases one tonalamatl runs across several pages of the manuscript.\r\n\r\n[242] If there should be two or more columns of day signs the topmost sign\r\nof the left-hand column is to be read first.\r\n\r\n[243] In the original this last red dot has disappeared. The writer has\r\ninserted it here to avoid confusing the beginner in his first acquaintance\r\nwith a tonalamatl.\r\n\r\n[244] This and similar outlines which follow are to be read down in\r\ncolumns.\r\n\r\n[245] The fifth sign in the lower row is also a sign of the Death God (see\r\nfig. 3). Note the eyelashes, suggesting the closed eyes of the dead.\r\n\r\n[246] The last sign Chuen, as mentioned above, is only a repetition of the\r\nfirst sign, indicating that the tonalamatl has re-entered itself.\r\n\r\n[247] As previously stated, the order of reading the glyphs in columns is\r\nfrom left to right and top to bottom.\r\n\r\n[248] The right-hand dot of the 13 is effaced.\r\n\r\n[249] The manuscript has incorrectly 7.\r\n\r\n[250] In the title of plate 30 the page number should read 102 instead of\r\n113.\r\n\r\n[251] The manuscript incorrectly has 24.\r\n\r\n[252] Incorrectly recorded as 13 in the text.\r\n\r\n[253] Incorrectly recorded as 15 in the text.\r\n\r\n[254] _Bull. 28, Bur. Amer. Ethn._, p. 400.\r\n\r\n[255] The terminal dates reached have been omitted, since for comparative\r\nwork the Initial-series numbers alone are sufficient to show the relative\r\npositions in the Long Count.\r\n\r\n[256] The manuscript incorrectly reads 10.13.3.13.2; that is, reversing the\r\nposition of the tun and uinal coefficients.\r\n\r\n[257] The manuscript incorrectly reads 10.8.3.16.4. The katun coefficient\r\nis changed to 13, above. These corrections are all suggested by Professor\r\nFörstemann and are necessary if the calculations he suggests are correct,\r\nas seems probable.\r\n\r\n[258] The manuscript incorrectly reads 8.16.4.11.0. The uinal coefficient\r\nis changed to an 8, above.\r\n\r\n[259] The manuscript incorrectly reads 10.19.6.0.8. The uinal coefficient\r\nis changed to 1, above.\r\n\r\n[260] The manuscript incorrectly reads 9.16.4.10.18. The uinal coefficient\r\nis changed to 11, above.\r\n\r\n[261] The manuscript incorrectly reads 9.19.8.7.8. The tun coefficient is\r\nchanged to 5, above.\r\n\r\n[262] Bowditch, 1909: p. 279.\r\n\r\n[263] The manuscript has incorrectly 16 Uo. It is obvious this can not be\r\ncorrect, since from Table VII Kan can occupy only the 2d, 7th, 12th, or\r\n17th position in the months. The correct reading here, as we shall see, is\r\nprobably 17 Uo. This reading requires only the addition of a single dot.\r\n\r\n[264] In the text the coefficient appears to be 8, but in reality it is 9,\r\nthe lower dot having been covered by the marginal line at the bottom.\r\n\r\n[265] Counting backward 8.2.0 (2,920) from 9 Ahau, 1 Ahau is reached.\r\n\r\n[266] Professor Förstemann restored the top terms of the four numbers in\r\nthis row, so as to make them read as given above.\r\n\r\n[267] The manuscript reads 1.12.5.0, which Professor Förstemann corrects to\r\n1.12.8.0; in other words, changing the uinal from 5 to 8. This correction\r\nis fully justified in the above calculations.",
