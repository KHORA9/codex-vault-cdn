What a world of memories is suggested by the name.\r\n\r\nStanding right in the heart of London, it is almost the only surviving\r\nout-of-door public pleasure resort left in the West-End, wherein\r\nfashion may display itself and take exercise, since St. James’s Park\r\nhas now no social life, and Spring Gardens, Vauxhall, Old Ranelagh, and\r\nCremorne are long since dead.\r\n\r\nGay as it is now in the season with its well-dressed saunterers, its\r\nbeautiful equipages, its noble trees, and its wide expanse of water, it\r\nconjures up dark and evil memories, for the Park has been the scene of\r\nstirring events in our national history. Nor is its romantic mystery\r\nentirely of the past, even now.\r\n\r\nSurrounded by the palaces of the rich, the resort of the favoured ones\r\nof the earth, for whose wealth and ostentation it provides a fitting\r\nbackground; it forms also the refuge of the vicious and the destitute,\r\nand, alas, its green sward serves as the dormitory of filthy vagrants,\r\nwhose very existence in this city of boundless wealth is an eyesore and\r\na reproach. There, vice and virtue still jostle each other, poverty and\r\nriches, greed and simplicity: there, every creed is expounded, every\r\ngrievance aired, every nostrum advocated with violent vociferation hard\r\nby the spot where, upon the fatal Triple Tree of Tyburn, scores of\r\nmiserable martyrs went to their doom for daring to put into words the\r\nthoughts that were their own.\r\n\r\nThe Park now extends from Park Lane to Kensington Gardens, and from\r\nthe Bayswater Road to Knightsbridge; but the creation of Kensington\r\nGardens in the reign of George II.—sheltering the Royal Palace where\r\nQueen Victoria was born in 1819—robbed Hyde Park of 300 acres of land.\r\nQueen Caroline devoted much time and thought to the formation of the\r\nSerpentine and the beautifying of the surroundings of her Palace.\r\n\r\nRoughly speaking, Hyde Park is about 3¼ miles round, or covers an\r\nextent of 360 acres. This is by no means enormous, not as large as the\r\nBois de Boulogne in Paris, nor as wild as _Thier gaarten_ in Berlin,\r\nbut there are trees in Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens which far\r\nsurpass in bulk and beauty the trees of either of these Continental\r\nrivals. We have in Hyde Park none of the “ancestral statues” such as\r\nBerlin has to represent the noble army of the Kaiser’s forebears. Our\r\nPark is not quite like the Castellana in Madrid, where fashion drives\r\nfrom the Prado during the dusk, shut up in truly Spanish fashion in\r\nclosed carriages, or the Prater in Vienna, where so many beautiful\r\nwomen may be seen; nor is it nearly as large as the Fairmount Park in\r\nPhiladelphia, which, however, is more of wild common than cultivated\r\nland.\r\n\r\nHyde Park differs from all these; and Hyde Park stands within a huge\r\ncity, and not a mile or two outside. It is not newly planted or freshly\r\nmade, and some of the trees within its railings, dating back through\r\nmany centuries, would be hard to rival in any land. So interesting,\r\nindeed, are the trees and shrubs and plants, the birds and beasts, that\r\na list will be found in an appendix.\r\n\r\nAt an early period in the history of Great Britain, this district must\r\nhave been part of the vast forest that lay inland from the little\r\nBritish settlement, founded on the banks of the Thames before the\r\nRomans landed. These early inhabitants of London lived in rude huts,\r\nprobably stretching from where the Tower now stands to Dowgate, their\r\nsimple tenements forming the beginning of the present great throbbing\r\nheart of the Empire.\r\n\r\nIt is probably true that at the time of the Saxons, parts of the\r\nPark of to-day were cultivated in the primitive fashion of the race;\r\nwhile the forests afforded good feeding-ground for the hogs which\r\nlater formed such an important item in the farming operations of our\r\nancestors.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that a forest in ancient times meant not only a\r\nthickly wooded area, but also wide open glades and spaces, in which\r\nsimple homesteads nestled and cattle grazed. In these the Saxons,\r\naccording to the sparse records of the period, turned their attention\r\nto their “wyrt-tun” (plant-enclosure) or “wyrt-geard” (plant-yard),\r\nfrom which probably originated the modern kitchen garden. The leek\r\nseems to have been the favourite object of culture as a vegetable,\r\nthe name _leac_ being a pure Anglo-Saxon word, and in the old MSS.\r\nthe terms “leac-tun” and “leac-ward” are equivalent to the modern\r\ndesignations “kitchen garden” and “gardener.” The rose and the lily are\r\nmentioned; but whether cultivated or not is a matter of uncertainty,\r\nfor probably the only plants cherished and propagated were those which\r\nprovided material for food, or had medicinal qualities of value.\r\n\r\nLater, as will be seen, an orchard stood in Hyde Park, and in due\r\ncourse many other queer institutions and customs within that field will\r\nbe disclosed, for Hyde Park has, indeed, had a curious history; so\r\ncurious that it reads more like fiction than fact.\r\n\r\nAs Hyde Park, however, its importance really began under Henry VIII.,\r\nwho seized it from the Church. Then it became _Hyde Park_ for the\r\nfirst time; before that it was merely grazing land and ditches of no\r\nparticular interest, known as “The Manor of Hyde.”\r\n\r\nCrown hunting lands were called Forests, Chases, and Parks.\r\n\r\nForests were portions of land consisting both of woodland and\r\npasture circumscribed by certain bounds, within which the right of\r\nhunting was reserved exclusively for the King, and subject to a code\r\nof special laws, often of great severity, and a special staff of\r\nofficers—Verderers, Regarders, Agistors, Foresters, and Woodwards.\r\n\r\nA Chase was, like a Forest, unenclosed, but it had no special code of\r\nlaws, offenders being subject to the Civil Law, and its custodians were\r\nonly _keepers_ and _woodwards_.\r\n\r\nA Park was like a Chase, as to laws and custodians, but was always\r\nenclosed by a wall or paling. Later, Parks and Chases could be held by\r\nprivate individuals, but a Forest could only belong to a King.\r\n\r\nSituated as Hyde Park now is, right in the heart of the great city,\r\nwith its seven million inhabitants, it seems well-nigh impossible to\r\npicture the same place even half a century ago, standing as it then did\r\non the border of market gardens. Yet such was the case. The _Memoirs_\r\nof a modern artist like William Frith, R.A., painter of the once famous\r\n“Derby Day,” and only published at the end of the nineteenth century,\r\nspeak of the writer’s youthful rambles through the market gardens on\r\nwhich now stands Cromwell Road, adjacent to the Park.\r\n\r\nA perfect storehouse of such recollection is Frederic Harrison,\r\nhistorian, essayist, Positivist, and man of letters. In 1907, referring\r\nto Hyde Park, he wrote me the following:\r\n\r\n“I am more of a boy at seventy-five than I was at fifteen”; and then\r\nhe goes on to say how well he remembers the neighbourhood where Tyburn\r\nformerly stood.\r\n\r\n“When I came to London in 1840, Connaught Place was nearly the farthest\r\nwestern extension of regular houses along the Bayswater Road. From\r\nAlbion Street, westwards and northwards, there were open market\r\ngardens. Hyde Park Gardens and Square, Oxford and Cambridge Squares,\r\nGloucester and Sussex Squares were just beginning to emerge, and I have\r\nplayed cricket on the site of Westbourne Terrace. At that time a long\r\nbrick wall ran along the north side of Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens\r\nbeside the Bayswater Road, and very dismal and dirty it was. There was\r\nno Marble Arch then, and the burial-ground was used daily. Notting Hill\r\nGate, of course, was a “pike.” Working people, servants in livery, and\r\ndogs were not allowed in Kensington Gardens. On the occasion of a storm\r\nthe rule was relaxed, and footmen for once were allowed to bring in the\r\numbrellas!\r\n\r\n“My father, who was born in the eighteenth century, as a boy lived in\r\nNo. 9 Berkeley Street, opposite to the garden of Devonshire House,\r\nin the house which my aunt ultimately sold to Prince Louis Napoleon.\r\nAbout the year 1810, the boys would often spend a holiday in Hyde Park,\r\nwhich was then a deer-park, as rural and solitary as Windsor Forest\r\nnow. Of course, there was neither bridge over the Serpentine nor Powder\r\nMagazine. The corner of the Park between Kensington Gardens and the\r\nSerpentine was a solitude, where the boys would bring their baskets and\r\npicnic.\r\n\r\n“Sixty years ago I can remember magnificent forest trees, chestnuts,\r\noaks, and elms, in Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens, as fine as any in\r\nthis island. They are nearly all gone. I have seen about a thousand\r\nswept away.\r\n\r\n“The rows of carriages, often two deep, continued in Hyde Park down\r\nto about 1860, as thick as shown in Doyle’s sketches for Pip’s Diary\r\nin _Punch_. Ten or twenty thousand ‘bucks’ or ‘dandies’ hung over the\r\nrails on the footpath to look on. And the carriages were so closely\r\npacked in line that they could only just walk. On one occasion, about\r\n1856, the throng of carriages to see the muster of the Four-in-Hand\r\nClub Drags was so great that the carriages could not be extricated from\r\nthe line. Many had to remain into the night, and the fine ladies were\r\nobliged to descend and walk home in the dusk.\r\n\r\n“The famous tearing down of the railings of the Park in 1866 was an\r\naccident, and almost a joke. A good-humoured crowd had gathered to\r\nsee what Mr. Edmond Beales and the Reform League would do when the\r\npolice stopped them from entering the Park. Mr. Beales turned back\r\nand went home, and never knew what happened, as he told me himself,\r\ntill he reached his home at night. The crowd, seeing no fun, began to\r\namuse themselves with singing and climbing up on the railing, which\r\nwas hardly strong enough, or high enough, to stop a flock of sheep.\r\nSuddenly, with shouts of laughter, the rail fell inwards, and the crowd\r\nnaturally followed, but without a thought of any concerted action. The\r\npeople got hot and angry on the following days. But the famous Hyde\r\nPark Riot of 1866 was a mere street scramble owing to the rotten state\r\nof the old railing.”\r\n\r\nThese are the words of a living writer, and yet how much is changed.\r\nCricket on the site of Westbourne Terrace seems almost as remote as\r\nthe hundreds, aye, thousands, of hangings that took place near where\r\nthe Marble Arch now stands. There stood Tyburn, probably the most\r\ngruesome, gory spot in the whole of the British Isles.\r\n\r\nThe brick wall has long since disappeared, and even the inner railings\r\nbetween the side-walks and the road have almost all gone.\r\n\r\nWisely Tyburn has been swept away by its later rulers. Not a vestige of\r\nthe name survives to remind the passers-by that it once existed, except\r\non the iron tablet which marks the site of the old turnpike gate, and\r\nbears the following inscription:\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HERE STOOD\r\n\r\n  TYBURN\r\n  GATE\r\n\r\n  1829]\r\n\r\nThis iron plate is about 4 feet high, and is a little to the west of\r\nthe clock-house at the Marble Arch, just opposite Edgware Road. So it\r\nwas well within the last hundred years that Tyburn Gate disappeared.\r\n\r\nHyde Park, as a place for intrigue, strongly appealed to the dramatist\r\nof the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and has been immortalised\r\nby many poets. Ben Jonson speaks of it in the Prologue of _The Staple\r\nNews_, and in _The World in the Moon_ (1620). An old ballad in the\r\nRoxburgh Collection sings:\r\n\r\n  “Of all parts of England, Hyde Park hath the name\r\n  For coaches and horses and persons of Fame.”\r\n\r\nShirley, too, named one of his plays _Hyde Park_, and laid his plot\r\nwithin its boundaries. Pepys went to see the performance of the play,\r\nand formed a poor opinion of it. Other authors have written of the Park\r\nin this sense, as a background for dramatic tales of intrigue; such as\r\nEtherage in _The Man of Mode_ (1676), Howard in _The English Monsieur_\r\n(1674), Southerne in _The Maid’s Last Prayer_ (1693), Farquhar in _The\r\nConstant Couple_ (1700), and Congreve in _The Way of the World_ (1760).\r\n\r\nFrom those far distant days to the present Hyde Park has never lost its\r\nprestige as a meeting-place for all classes of English Society; and\r\nthe present volume is an attempt to depict its story in a more or less\r\nconnected form.\r\n\r\nNor must the grim records of Tyburn, so closely associated with the\r\nPark, be forgotten. From the date of the first public hanging on the\r\noutskirts of the Park in 1196, right down to late in the eighteenth\r\ncentury, a constant succession of unhappy beings were done to death\r\nhere, sometimes for crimes which in our more merciful days would be\r\nhardly punished by a forty-shilling fine; and in the dread days of the\r\nreligious persecution in the times of the Tudors, this place of heroic\r\nmartyrdom saw some of the sublimest deaths in the history of our land.\r\nUpon hurdles, bound in ignominy, down Snow Hill and along the Oxford\r\nRoad, just stopping for a last stirrup-cup to speed them upon their way\r\nat St. Giles’s Spital, were drawn martyrs and malefactors innumerable.\r\n\r\nThe doomed Carthusians, the Maid of Kent, heroic Campion, the miserable\r\nDr. Lopez and his Portuguese confederates; priests, protestants,\r\npatriots, and rogues, for ages all such took their last look on earth\r\nat Hyde Park; first from the rise behind Connaught Terrace, and later\r\nfrom the open space at the corner of the Edgware Road.\r\n\r\nSporting ground, shambles, dwelling-place, scene of intrigue, theatre\r\nof Royal magnificence and military display, the Park through the\r\ncenturies may be said almost to epitomise the history of England, and\r\nto the present day it has never ceased to be interesting.\r\n\r\nThe enormous crowds that frequent the place even now is seen by the\r\nfact that it contains about 35,000 chairs, and even that number is\r\noften insufficient in the height of the season. Hundreds of long wooden\r\nbenches, too, are scattered all over the Park, where “Love’s young\r\ndream” continues from morn till eve, year in year out. Soldiers from\r\nthe barracks hard by at Knightsbridge make love to pretty nursemaids;\r\nyoung men from the shops in Bayswater or Kensington whisper sweet\r\nnothings into the ears of handsome girls, and, according to the\r\npractice favoured by them, sit with their arm round one another’s neck\r\nor waist.\r\n\r\nVarious classes are to be found in Hyde Park. For instance, the élite\r\ndrive on summer afternoons from five to seven, when four or five rows\r\nof motors and carriages moving along at crawling pace is quite a common\r\nsight. The fashionable drive used to be from Hyde Park Corner to\r\nKnightsbridge Barracks, but every few years fashions change, and during\r\nthe last two seasons far more carriages were to be found between Hyde\r\nPark Corner and the Marble Arch.\r\n\r\nEvery afternoon when she is in town, the Queen drives round the\r\nPark between six and seven. There is no pomp or show. A mounted\r\npoliceman goes in front to clear the way, and at a distance of fifty\r\nyards follows the royal carriage, just an ordinary, high C-spring\r\nbarouche with red wheels, and a couple of men-servants in black\r\nlivery with black cockades. Behind the coachman sits the Queen of\r\nEngland. She often has guests with her, but if not, drives alone with\r\na Lady-in-Waiting, generally the Hon. Charlotte Knollys, one of that\r\nfaithful family attached to the Court, and a Gentleman-in-Waiting\r\nopposite.\r\n\r\nThe carriage passes along at an ordinary trot, and every one bows, the\r\ngentlemen raising their hats, in fact keeping them off until the Queen\r\nhas passed. No woman in Europe knows how to bow more graciously than\r\nQueen Alexandra. She is blessed with a long swan-like neck, exquisitely\r\nset upon her shoulders, and whether in her carriage or in a décolletée\r\ngown at Buckingham Palace, the gracious inclination of her head is a\r\nform of queenly bow to be admired.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty is always very quietly dressed, never wearing anything\r\n_outré_ in fashion. When huge sleeves are worn, hers are of medium\r\nsize. She is probably the best-gowned woman in Europe, and is certainly\r\none of the most simply dressed. Since the death of her eldest son, in\r\n1892, she has never worn bright colours,—black, white, grey, dark blue,\r\npurple, or heliotrope being her favourites.\r\n\r\nWhen the King or Queen is in town, the centre gate of the Marble Arch\r\nis thrown open for them to pass through, and the ground is neatly\r\nsanded. This rule is also observed at the entrance to Constitution Hill.\r\n\r\nProbably the Park is at its fullest in this year of grace 1908 on\r\nSunday between twelve and two; there are practically no carriages;\r\nit is the hour of the _Prayer-Book Brigade_. Everybody has been to\r\nChurch, and those who have not are said to carry small books in their\r\nhands, so that their friends may imagine they have freshly returned\r\nfrom a service. On hot days in May, June, and July, it is delightfully\r\ncool beneath the trees from the Achilles Statue to Stanhope Gate, and\r\nliterally thousands of people sit and chat to their friends at that\r\ntime. Some walk up and down while looking for acquaintances or waiting\r\nfor a chair; others go early and pay for their seat, determined to\r\noccupy it until it is time to go home to luncheon. Some of the most\r\nbeautiful women in Europe may be seen in the Park on Sunday.\r\n\r\nOf course the place is public, and the crowd is therefore mixed. It is\r\nnot as aristocratic, for instance, as the Royal Enclosure at Ascot,\r\nor the lawn for the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown; but then it is not one\r\nday in the year, but any and every Sunday during the warmer months,\r\nthat these people may be found congregated together. Two o’clock\r\nbeing the ordinary luncheon hour, there is a general exodus a little\r\nbefore that time, and it was amusing in 1906 to notice the people all\r\nendeavouring to engage the smart public motor landaulettes and hansoms\r\nwhich plied for hire at Hyde Park Corner for the first time. They were\r\na new invasion—one that quickly found favour in the eyes of the public,\r\nfollowed a year later by taximeter cabs.\r\n\r\nAfter tea on Sundays in the summer the Park fills again. People stroll\r\nin to have chats with their friends or rest in the cool shade; and\r\nagain those thousands of chairs are occupied.\r\n\r\nIt is curious how the classes divide themselves. Between the Achilles\r\nMonument and the Serpentine is a bandstand, round which a certain\r\nproportion of the seats are railed off. In the summer evenings\r\nexcellent music is given, but very few of the upper-ten avail\r\nthemselves of the privilege which the middle classes so eagerly enjoy.\r\nIt is a great occasion for shop people and servants, who seem to\r\nthoroughly revel in those Sunday Concerts, which each year prove more\r\nand more successful.\r\n\r\nThe year passes in Hyde Park like the figures in a kaleidoscope.\r\n\r\nIn January, when it is dark in the mornings and cold in the evenings,\r\nthe riders come out about ten, and the drivers, dwindled in numbers,\r\nmostly vacate their vehicles and take a quiet walk before luncheon. All\r\nis cold and damp and drear.\r\n\r\nThen come the early spring flowers. Yellow, white, or purple crocuses\r\nraise their heads in the Park. They are not planted in beds or in stiff\r\nrows; but come up in patches of colour in the grass. Here a mass of\r\nyellow, there a mass of heliotrope, filling the air with the early cry\r\nof spring. These crocuses, in themselves a joy, are quickly followed\r\nby daffodils, narcissi, and groups of gorse and broom. Then the leaves\r\nunfold upon the trees, laburnum fights pinky-brown copper beech,\r\nhorse-chestnuts raise their blooms, hawthorn scents the air, and lilac\r\nabounds. Then it is that the hyacinth beds become a dream along the\r\nprecincts of Park Lane, giving forth sweet scents and glorious masses\r\nof colour. Flower beds were first instituted in Hyde Park in 1860.\r\n\r\nRhododendrons burst into flower, quickly followed by those gorgeous\r\nbeds of yellow azalea that we, who love the Park, know so well.\r\n\r\nThe bedding plants for Kensington Gardens, Hyde Park, and St. James’s\r\nPark are largely supplied from the nursery gardens near the Ranger’s\r\nLodge in the centre of the Park itself, and not from Kew, as is\r\nordinarily supposed.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn these plants are given away to the poor of the parishes\r\nwho care to apply for them.\r\n\r\nPeople have returned to town. The hunting is over; the Riviera has\r\nceased to attract. Egypt is too hot. The Academy and Opera are open,\r\nand the London Season has begun.\r\n\r\nCertain hours are given up to certain things, and the first occupants\r\nof the Park in the early morning are the members of the _Liver\r\nBrigade_. As a child at the age of seven, and for ten years after that,\r\nI rode with my father every morning at half-past seven in Rotten Row,\r\nreturning to breakfast, to change my habit, and go to school; and for\r\nnearly ten years more I did the same with my husband, going—instead\r\nof to school, on my return—to the kitchen to order the dinner. My\r\nacquaintance with Hyde Park is, therefore, not imaginary, but real—very\r\nreal.\r\n\r\nThe Liver Brigade in the Park is a regular London institution.\r\nJudges, barristers, surgeons, physicians, actors, writers, African\r\nmillionaires, and German Jews all ride in the morning between\r\nhalf-past seven and ten o’clock. Many of them are known to each other,\r\nconsequently friendly greetings and pleasant chats are exchanged while\r\nthe Liver Brigade take exercise, knowing well that on their return home\r\nto bath and breakfast they will have to settle down to the Law Courts,\r\nChambers, or the Consulting-room for the rest of the day. That hour’s\r\nride in the morning has been the salvation of many a brain-weary man\r\nand woman.\r\n\r\nIn the eighties and nineties the people dressed most smartly. I well\r\nremember my tight-fitting habit and tall silk hat, my white stock in\r\nwinter, or high collar and white tie in summer. The menfolk wore silk\r\nhats and black hunting coats, smart breeches and high patent boots. All\r\nthis is changed; a go-as-you-please air has overtaken the riders. The\r\nwomen wear loose coats with sack backs, cotton shirts, sailor hats,\r\nbillycocks—anything and everything that brings comfort, even if it\r\ndeprives them of grace. The men don caps and tweeds, brown boots and\r\nputties, in fact, any rough-and-tumble country kit.\r\n\r\nNo sooner has the Liver Brigade departed than the Park is given over to\r\nthe babies and nurses. In the summer these women are entirely dressed\r\nin white piqué, and in winter in grey cloth or flannel. There are\r\nliterally hundreds—one might say thousands—of nurses and aristocratic\r\nbabies disporting themselves every day in Hyde Park. The infants go\r\nhome fairly early to their midday sleep, at which hour the governesses\r\nand bigger children, having accomplished their morning’s work, come out\r\nto the Park, which by twelve o’clock is given over to older childhood.\r\n\r\nThese are the regular habitués, but there are others who are constant\r\nvisitors to Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens. There are men and women\r\nwho, year in year out, come daily with their little bags of crumbs to\r\nfeed the birds,—people who are followed by whole flocks of sparrows and\r\npigeons, or, nearer the Serpentine, by ducks and swans.\r\n\r\nExcept in the height of the season, men and women no longer dress\r\nsmartly in the Park. The magnificent horses, high-steppers with\r\nwell-arched necks and splendid paces, are rapidly being superseded\r\nby the motor-car. Instead of beautifully dressed ladies and smartly\r\ngroomed men in silk hats and frock coats, sitting in carriages, women\r\nsmothered in veils and hideous goggles, and men looking more like\r\ncut-throat villains than gentlemen, are seen dashing through the Park\r\nin motors. No more unbecoming attire was ever invented for men and\r\nwomen than the modern motor get-up.\r\n\r\nTen weeks complete the great social event known as the London season.\r\nNo sooner has July dawned than palms and canes, semi-tropical flowers\r\nand plants, appear upon the scene. Their pots are so cleverly planted\r\nthat the date palm, the sugarcane, and the sweet corn of the Indies\r\nreally look as if they were growing out of the grass itself, and\r\nconvert Hyde Park into a semi-tropical botanical garden for a couple of\r\nmonths. Then station-omnibuses laden with babies and bundles begin to\r\nply our streets, and day by day the crowd grows thinner in the Park.\r\nBy August only foreigners with Baedekers are to be found where Society\r\nfluttered but a short time before. Then come autumn tints, winter fogs,\r\nand utter desolation.\r\n\r\nAnd thus from generation to generation Hyde Park has been the\r\nplayground of London’s rich and poor, the wide theatre upon which their\r\ntragedies and comedies have been enacted, the forum in which many\r\npublic liberties have been demanded, the scene where national triumphs\r\nhave been celebrated.\r\n\r\nTo write fully the history of a space so crowded with pregnant\r\nmemories would be too great a task for any one pen, nor could a\r\nsingle book hope to hold one tithe of the interesting memories which\r\nthrong these precincts; but I trust that the rapid survey given in\r\nthe following pages, of some of the famous happenings and curious\r\ntraditions connected with the place, may not be unwelcome to those who\r\nnow adorn Hyde Park.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nA ROYAL HUNTING-GROUND\r\n\r\n\r\nHyde Park in its present guise is essentially modern. It preserves\r\nnothing of that old-world air which makes the lawn of Hampton Court and\r\nthe formal gardens of Windsor Castle so delightful.\r\n\r\nRotten Row as a tan ride has been laid out in the memory of people\r\nstill living. The Marble Arch on its present site is Victorian.\r\nBurton’s Arch, and the screen at Hyde Park Corner, are but a little\r\nearlier. Queen Caroline, consort of George II., formed the Serpentine.\r\nQueen Anne planted avenues of stately elms. Charles I. made “The Ring,”\r\nthough few now-a-days will identify the spot which for so long was the\r\nmeeting-place of the fashion of the town. With all this the Park is\r\nvery old, and as open land left to nature undisturbed, its history may\r\nbe traced back in an unbroken record to the time when it was part of\r\nthe wild forest that originally surrounded London.\r\n\r\nThe earliest record of any definite facts concerning this locality\r\ndates from the year 960 A.D., when St. Dunstan, zealous to establish\r\nmonasteries under the strict rule of the Benedictine Order, received\r\na grant of land from the Saxon King Edgar for the purpose of forming\r\na religious house at Westminster. The Charter conferring this grant\r\nclearly defined the area allotted to the monastery, the boundary on the\r\nwest being the course of the river Tyburn, traced from the Thames to\r\nthe Via Trinobantia—the military way of the Romans from their fortified\r\nsettlement on the Thames to the coast of the Solent. Later, this part\r\nof the Roman highway out of London became known as Tyburn Road, and\r\nto-day is Oxford Street.\r\n\r\nThe original name of London was almost the same as it is to-day.\r\nLondinium is described by the earliest historian Tacitus, on the right\r\nbank of the Thames, forty years before Christ. A little Roman colony—a\r\nvery rude affair, and yet advanced enough to have a bath in almost\r\nevery house—was all there was of London two thousand years ago, and\r\nthis was on the site of the still ruder huts of the Trinobantes, whose\r\nname was perpetuated by the Romans in linking up their colonies in\r\ntheir newly acquired possession.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map of Westminster, showing the course of the Tyburn,\r\nand the Western boundary of the land granted by King Edgar to Dunstan.\r\n\r\n_From Map of London in Archælogia._]\r\n\r\nThe Tyburn—it is spelt indifferently Tyburn, Ty-burne, Tibourne, and in\r\nother ways—was a very little stream to figure so largely in history.\r\nSurely no rivulet of its size has borne a name more feared or written\r\nabout, unless it be the Styx itself. From the northern heights of\r\nHampstead and Highgate the waters drained off into many brooks. Of\r\nthese the most important was Tyburn, which ran from Hampstead across\r\nthe district now known as Regent’s Park to Tyburn Road, which it\r\ncrossed somewhere near Stratford Place. Thence the stream made its way\r\nthrough the modern Brook Street, Hay Hill, Lansdowne Gardens, Half\r\nMoon Street, and along the valley in Piccadilly, where it was crossed\r\nby a bridge.\r\n\r\nHow few of us realise what a hill there is in Piccadilly, or that\r\na bridge over a stream there could ever have been necessary. When\r\nPiccadilly is full of traffic the steep dip is scarcely noticeable,\r\nbut at night, when the lamps are lighted, one discovers by the ups and\r\ndowns in the rows of twinkling lights that there is a veritable hill\r\nand vale, along which some of the most famous clubs in London are now\r\nbuilt.\r\n\r\nIn the Green Park the Tyburn widened into a large pond, from which it\r\nran past the spot where Buckingham Palace now stands, and fell into the\r\nThames in three branches, the main stream emptying itself at Chelsea.\r\nThe burn spread into a marsh as it neared the river, and finally\r\nsurrounded the wooded Thorney, or Isle of Thorns, on which Westminster\r\nAbbey was built.\r\n\r\nRunning nearly parallel with the little Tyburn was another rivulet,\r\nwhich flowed through our present Park, namely, the West-bourne. This,\r\ntoo, rose in the high lands near Hampstead, fought its way down hill to\r\nBayswater, where Westbourne Terrace now stands, and crossed Hyde Park,\r\ntaking a southerly course near the present site of Albert Gate, where\r\na foot-bridge was built. It passed thence through Lowndes Square and\r\nChesham Street, finally discharging into the Thames by two mouths near\r\nthe grounds of the Royal Hospital at Chelsea.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying map will illustrate this description and give interest\r\nto the above details.\r\n\r\nThese two little rivulets practically watered that part of the forest,\r\nwhile London for centuries afterwards was confined to the walled town\r\nending at Blackfriars. Both are lost to sight to-day. They can no\r\nlonger be seen above ground, although their springs help to flood our\r\ndrains and keep them fresh and clean. As Dean Stanley says: “There is\r\na quaint humour in the fact that the great arteries of our crowded\r\nstreets, the vast sewers which cleanse our habitations, are fed by the\r\nlifeblood of those old and living streams; that underneath our tread\r\nthe Tyburn, and the Holborn, and the Fleet, and the Wall Brook, are\r\nstill pursuing their course, still ministering to the good of man.” The\r\nidentical course of the Tyburn given in the Charter of King Edgar is\r\nfollowed by the “King’s Pond Sewer.”\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the land lying between the Tyburn and the\r\nWestbourne was practically an island. It was known as the Manor of\r\nEia—the Ey-land—and included all the district between Westminster and\r\nChelsea to the extent of some 890 acres. Hence in the words Hyde and\r\nHay may be seen the corruption of the Anglo-Saxon “ey” or “ei,” an\r\nisland; in Ty-bourne, of “Ey-bourne.” Anyone familiar with Cockney\r\ndialect will easily account for the “H” in _Hyde_ and _Hay_. The “T” in\r\nTy-bourne is probably an abbreviation of the Saxon word “aet,” the road\r\nnear; the word thus signifying “the-road-near-the-island-stream.”\r\n\r\nThis Manor of Eia was, after the completion of Domesday Book (1086), in\r\naccordance with the custom of Feudal times, divided into three Manors,\r\nnamely, Neyt, Eubery, and Hide, and here again is found the corruption\r\nof the word “ey” in “Neyt” and “Eubery” (Ebury). There seems to be some\r\ndoubt as to the origin of Knightsbridge, but it most probably took its\r\nname from the bridge over the West-bourne, near the site of the Albert\r\nGate, which apparently was held as a military post, to control the\r\noutlaws who infested the morass to the south.\r\n\r\nThe land had, before the Norman Conquest, been one of the emoluments of\r\nthe Saxon Master of the Horse, and was probably a Royal hunting-ground,\r\nfor Edward the Confessor, who, historians agree, was more of a monk\r\nthan a ruler, had a passion for hawking and hunting. The chase followed\r\nhis morning prayers with curious regularity. More than that, he\r\npursued his game to the death, and was as hard-hearted in watching\r\ntheir struggles as he was severe in his forest laws, or angry at any\r\ncontretemps that marred his sport. Through the thick forests which\r\nsurrounded London he rode forth, hawk on wrist, watchful for bird or\r\nhound to give sign of the hidden quarry. Bull and boar, deer, wolf,\r\nand hare were all victims of the Saxon’s sport. Harold is depicted in\r\nthe Bayeux Tapestry hawk on hand, his hounds round him, ready for the\r\nchase, which, like his predecessor, he may have enjoyed within the\r\nprecincts of Hyde Park.\r\n\r\nIf we could see again our present Park lands with the eyes which\r\nsaw them eight or nine centuries ago, we should doubtless find them\r\nsheltering game in abundance. Owls screeched among the gnarled trunks\r\nof the old trees which grew in the undisturbed forest, foxes and\r\nsquirrels played at hide-and-seek, deer abounded, wild boars and wolves\r\nwere plentiful, flocks of wild fowl stayed their flight at the marshes;\r\nin fact, all the wild animals known in Britain at that time were to be\r\nfound in those forest lands, protected by the strictest game laws.\r\n\r\nAfter his coronation in London, William the Conqueror gave a wide\r\nextent of land, including the Manor of Eia, to Geoffrey de Mandeville,\r\na Norman knight who had distinguished himself in the battle of\r\nHastings. When Geoffrey and his wife found age creeping upon them, they\r\nwished to secure the right of being buried in Westminster Abbey, and\r\nas a bribe the old knight handed over the Manor of Eia to the monks of\r\nWestminster. Thus, what is now Hyde Park, throughout its wide extent,\r\nbecame Church land.\r\n\r\nIn the Domesday Book the area of modern Hyde Park is thus described:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  “OSVLVESTANE HUNDRED.\r\n\r\n“Geoffrey de Mandeville holds Eia. It was assessed for ten hides. The\r\nland is eight carucates. In the demesne there are five hides and there\r\nare two ploughs there. The villanes have five ploughs, and a sixth\r\ncan be made. One villane (has) half a hide there, and there are four\r\nvillanes each with one virgate, and fourteen others each with half a\r\nvirgate, and four bordars with one virgate, and one cottager. Meadow\r\nfor eight ploughs; and sixty shillings for hay. For the pasture,\r\nseven shillings. With all its profits it is worth eight pounds; when\r\nreceived, six pounds: in the time of King Edward, twelve pounds. Harold\r\nthe son of Earl Ralph held this manor; whom Queen Editha had charge of\r\nwith the manor on the very day in which King Edward was alive and dead.\r\nAfterwards William the Chamberlain held it of the Queen in fee to farm\r\nfor three pounds yearly, and after the death of the Queen he held it\r\nof the King in the same manner. There are now four years since William\r\nlost the Manor, and the King’s farm has not been rendered therefrom,\r\nthat is twelve pounds.”\r\n\r\nSome explanation of the terms used is desirable.\r\n\r\n“Villeins” were the serfs, and were divided into classes, namely, those\r\nwho were sold with the land on which they dwelt and worked, and those\r\nwho were the absolute property of their master, and could be bought\r\nand sold at his will. The former class, known as _villeins regardant_,\r\noften rented small holdings from their master, and paid rent by\r\nproduce, amongst these being the “bordars.”\r\n\r\nA “hide” of land was of different sizes in different localities, but\r\nprobably contained about 100 acres, and apparently four _virgates_\r\nformed a hide. The _carucate_ was rather larger than a hide. The\r\nassessment referred to was Danegelt, a tax of twelve pence on every\r\nhide of land, first imposed by Ethelred the Unready as a means of\r\nraising money to keep the Danes out of England.\r\n\r\n“Meadows for eight ploughs” meant feeding capacity for teams of eight\r\nploughs. The woods were estimated in like manner. “Pannage and woods\r\nfor swine” was the mode of expressing the extent of the coppices and\r\nforest land, where the Saxon pigs were given their due, and allowed\r\nto roam in cleanliness and comfort, routing up the roots and munching\r\nthe berries. They were a very different kind of animal from the poor\r\ndegraded beast that wallows in the mire nowadays, which we call a pig.\r\n\r\nThere is a record extant of our Tudor Queen Mary, after a day’s hunting\r\nin one of the forests in the neighbourhood of London, sending a command\r\nto a farmer who held land there, that he must not allow his swine to\r\nroam in the woods and grub holes, in which the horses stumbled, thus\r\nendangering the life of the Royal lady; and, in terms brooking no\r\ndelay, she demanded that the holes already made should be filled up.\r\n\r\nAfter its mention in Domesday Book, and the subsequent gift by Geoffrey\r\nde Mandeville of the Manor of Eia, Hyde Park remained Church land for\r\nclose on four and a half centuries, during which period it had little\r\nhistory. It was the lardour of the monks. Lying remote from the town,\r\nchroniclers of the mediæval ages would probably have passed it over\r\nwith barely a word of notice but for two associations, one grim and\r\ndreadful, the other pleasant enough. The former, at least, has carried\r\nthe name of Tyburn down through centuries as a word of blackest omen.\r\n\r\nBy the side of the burn where it trickled down into the Park, stood the\r\ncommon gallows, of which much more will be said in another chapter.\r\nFrom springs feeding the burn, London obtained its first systematised\r\nwater supply, which served the needs of a portion of the town for two\r\nor three centuries.\r\n\r\nA few remote cottages were placed about the burn, and a little village\r\ngrew up, but at the close of the fourteenth century it was deserted.\r\nSmall wonder! The setting up of the gallows in its neighbourhood was\r\nsufficient cause for abandonment, within hearing, as the hamlet was,\r\nof the shrieks of the dying, and in sight of the processions that\r\nwended their way from the City to the gibbet. It was an age steeped in\r\nsuperstition, when people of high and low degree were staunch believers\r\nin witchcraft. Many a simple countryman must have been chilled with\r\nhorror at the weird sounds he heard when the wind swept over the\r\nscaffold at night, or in his disordered imagination he saw, amid the\r\ndarkness, the ghosts of victims return to visit the scenes where a\r\nviolent death had ended their tortures and sufferings.\r\n\r\nSo complete was the demoralisation of the district, that the church\r\nbuilt near Tyburn was the constant scene of robberies. Bells,\r\nvestments, books, images, and other ornaments were stolen, and in\r\nconsequence, in the year 1400, Robert Braybrooke, Bishop of London,\r\ngranted a licence to pull down the edifice. This was done, and a new\r\none was erected farther back from Tyburn Road, and dedicated to the\r\nVirgin Mary, the words “le-bourne” being added to the name of Mary\r\nto distinguish it from other churches dedicated to the Virgin, hence\r\nMarylebone.\r\n\r\nPepys writes of the district as “Marrow-bones,” and this appears to\r\nhave been the corruption in use in his day, as the form is often to\r\nbe found in the early eighteenth-century newspapers, at which time\r\n“Marrow-bone-Fields” seems to have been a popular pleasure resort.\r\n\r\nFrom Tyburn the famous Great Conduit was fed. This remarkable\r\nenterprise is of more than passing interest, as it is among the\r\nearliest examples in this country of which record survives of a\r\nmunicipal water supply. The story of its origin is quaintly given by\r\nStow, who used such authorities as were at hand or traditions which he\r\ncould himself pick up in Queen Elizabeth’s reign:\r\n\r\n“The said River of Wels, the running water of Walbrooke, the Boornes\r\nafore named, and other the fresh waters that were in and about this\r\nCitie, being in process of time by incroachment for buildings, and\r\nheightnings of grounds mightily increased; they were forced to seeke\r\nfresh waters abroad, whereof some, at the request of King Henrie the\r\nthird, in the 21 yeere of his reigne, were (for the profit of the\r\nCitie, and good of the whole Realme thither repairing; to wit for the\r\npoore to drink, and the rich to dresse their meat) granted to the\r\nCitizens, and their Successors, by one Gilbert Sandford, with liberty\r\nto convey water from the towne of Teybourne, by pipes of lead into\r\ntheir Citie.”\r\n\r\nThe date thus ascribed to the origin of the Great Conduit was 1237-8.\r\n\r\nNear the close of the fourteenth century there was a large cistern,\r\ncastellated with stone, in the Chepe—modern Cheapside. The expense of\r\nthe works seem to have been heavy. Not only were various specific sums\r\nset aside, but foreign merchants visiting our shores were actually made\r\nto share the cost of the enterprise. Northouck says, writing of the\r\nyear 1236:\r\n\r\n“The foreign merchants, who were prohibited to land their goods in\r\nLondon, and were obliged to sell their merchandise on board a ship,\r\npurchased this year the privilege of landing and housing their\r\ncommodities, at the expence of fifty marks _per annum_ and a fine of\r\none hundred pounds, towards supplying the City of London with water\r\nfrom Tyburn. This project was put in execution by bringing water from\r\nsix fountains or wells in the town of Tyburn, by leaden pipes of 6-inch\r\nbore; which emptied themselves into stone cisterns or conduits lined\r\nwith lead.”\r\n\r\nThis conduit was largely an open channel, exposed to all the\r\nvicissitudes of weather and accident, and partly piped. Its course was\r\nby Tyburn to St. James’s Hill (now Constitution Hill); thence to the\r\nRoyal Mews, which occupied the present site of the National Gallery,\r\nand on through the Strand and Fleet Street to the Chepe. The pipes\r\nwere a great source of annoyance to the inhabitants of Fleet Street\r\nand thereabouts, as they frequently burst and caused inundations. So\r\nmuch so, indeed, that in 1388 the residents requested that they might\r\nmake a penthouse at their own cost; the request was granted, and it was\r\nerected where Salisbury Square now stands.\r\n\r\nIn the accounts of the Keepers of the Great Conduit for 1350, is the\r\nfollowing interesting little item: “For bringing the pipes of the said\r\nConduit into the King’s Mews, three men working for three days, each\r\nman receiving 8d. per day.” A little later the poet Chaucer was Clerk\r\nof the Works at these Royal Mews, so called because the King’s hawks\r\nwere kept there, the word _mews_ originating from the hawks “mewing,”\r\nor changing their feathers.\r\n\r\nThe Mayor (which title was substituted for that of “Port-Reeve” at\r\nRichard I.’s accession) and Aldermen made periodical inspections of\r\nthese important Conduits; the 18th of September seems to have been an\r\nespecially festive day in connection with these visits. Waggons brought\r\nthe ladies in grand fettle to the scene, while the gentlemen rode. It\r\nwas a great fête, a sort of country outing from the City, when all made\r\nmerry. They had a picnic and a feast in the Banqueting House, which\r\nthen stood near Hyde Park.\r\n\r\nStow gives an account of one of these visitations in his quaint\r\nlanguage, when he politely speaks of a hare as “she” and a fox as “he.”\r\n\r\n“These conduits used to be in former times visited; and particularly,\r\non the 18th of September 1562, the Lord Maior [Harper], Aldermen, and\r\nmany Worshipful Persons, and divers Masters and Wardens of the Twelve\r\nCompanies, rid to the Conduit Heads for to see them after the old\r\nCustom; And afore Dinner they hunted the Hare, and killed her, and\r\nthence to Dinner at the Head of the Conduit. There was a good number\r\nentertained with good Cheer by the Chamberlain. And after Dinner they\r\nwent to hunting the Fox. There was a great Cry for a mile; and at\r\nlength the Hounds killed him at the end of St. Giles’s. Great Hallowing\r\n(hallooing) at his Death, and blowing of Hornes: And thence the Lord\r\nMaior, with all his Company, rode through London to his Place in\r\nLombard Street.”\r\n\r\nFancy anyone being put to bed at eight o’clock!\r\n\r\nAt eight the bell of St. Martin’s-le-Grand—where the General Post\r\nOffice now stands—tolled the Curfew, and every other church in the\r\nMetropolis took up the note and rang forth the knell of day. It was\r\nsupposed that all lights and fires should be immediately put out, and\r\nthe city being in darkness everyone would retire to bed. Any way, it\r\nmay be reasonably supposed that the larger bulk of the population did\r\nas they were bid, and only very exalted personages dared appear at\r\nnight, and then escorted by a retinue of servants bearing torches and\r\nlanterns, and followed by armed men. London must indeed have been a\r\ncity of the dead by a few minutes past eight.\r\n\r\nWhat a running, hustling, and scuttling there must have been once\r\nCurfew had started, just as there is in Regent’s Park to-day when at\r\nsundown the Keeper calls forth that all gates must be closed. Surely\r\nthis must be a remnant of Curfew.\r\n\r\nThe principal gates of the Parks are now closed at midnight, although\r\nsome of the foot-gates are shut at sundown, so that even after all\r\nthese hundreds of years the parks are practically shut at night,\r\nexcept the main thoroughfare which crosses from the Bayswater Road to\r\nKnightsbridge, between the Victoria and the Alexandra Gates, which is\r\nalso the only part of the park where public vehicles, such as cabs, are\r\nallowed at any time, and no carts or vans have permission to pass.\r\n\r\nIn the Muniment Room at Westminster lies a paper (to which, through\r\nthe courtesy of Dean Armitage Robinson, I have been able to refer)\r\nthat records in 1285 the granting of parcels of land in the Manor\r\nof Hide to a tenant, reserving the right to enter and repair the\r\n“aqueductum subterraneum” running through them. This is the first of\r\nmany references to the springs in Hyde Park which for long supplied\r\nthe surrounding districts with water. When the Manor of Hide became a\r\nRoyal hunting-ground, the “original fountain” and all the watercourses\r\nleading from it to the site of St. Peter’s, and the right of entering\r\nto repair them, were restored to the Dean and Chapter.\r\n\r\nDean Stanley notes in his _History of Westminster_ how the Tyburn water\r\nwas considered especially good on account of its having run through a\r\nbed of gravel somewhere near the present site of Buckingham Palace.\r\nThere was in his time an ancient and well-worn pump standing in Dean’s\r\nYard, under the shadow of the Abbey.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Bathing Well in Hyde Park.\r\n _From a Print in the Crace Collection, British Museum._]\r\n\r\nSpeaking the other day to an old inhabitant of Westminster who\r\nremembered this pump, I learnt that it was in existence until about\r\ntwenty-five years ago, when the underground railway interfered with the\r\nspring, and although water was laid on from another source to provide\r\npassers-by with refreshment, the new supply was so little used that the\r\npump was removed. In my informant’s remembrance an old woman used to\r\nsit there, with a glass, to dole out the pure liquid from the spring;\r\nand in his youth (1835) old people told him that numbers of halt, sick,\r\nand lame came to Dean’s Yard, under the shadow of the Abbey, and pumped\r\nthe water on to their ailing limbs, or bathed their sores, while other\r\nvisitors carried away buckets full to sick folk at home, just as they\r\ndo at Lourdes to-day.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the Manor of Hide. Some writers think that about the\r\ntime of Edward III. it passed from the control of the monks, doubtless\r\nbecause there exists a document recording that Edward III. granted\r\nparcels of land in the Manor of Hide to his Barber, Adam de Thorpe.\r\nBut probably the King held the land in some way from the Abbot. It was\r\nin this reign, too, that John of Gaunt (son of Edward III.), styling\r\nhimself “King of Leon and Castille,” begged the Abbot of Westminster\r\nto grant him the use of the Neyte Manor House during the sitting of\r\nParliament; while about the same time Abbot Nicholas Littlington,\r\nwho did much good work for Westminster, and improved the Hide ground\r\nvastly, lived and died in the Neyte House.\r\n\r\nHyde Park as a Royal enclosure, as we have seen, is a Tudor creation.\r\nLike much else that has altered the appearance of this western area of\r\nLondon, its origin is traced back to the fall of Wolsey in 1530, when\r\nthe Cardinal’s magnificent Palace of York Place was promptly seized by\r\nhis imperious master. Henry VIII. renamed it Whitehall, and various\r\nadditions were planned. Grasping as he was by nature, Wolsey had not\r\nencompassed his home with any great extent of land. The river front\r\nwas the best part, and on the interior he had lavished his wealth.\r\n\r\nHenry had other ideas of a palace which he intended should be befitting\r\na King. To his larger ambitions is due the whole range of parks which\r\nnow extend from Westminster right across West London to Kensington.\r\nHis actions, however, show that he was entirely selfish, and he had\r\nat no time contemplated sharing his enjoyment with the people. Before\r\nhe had been twelve months in possession of Whitehall, the monarch had\r\nexchanged the Priory of Poughley, in Berkshire, for about 100 acres of\r\nland forming part of St. James’s Park and Spring Gardens, and of this\r\nhe made a convenient enclosure for the use of the Court.\r\n\r\nThe next extension of the Royal domain was on a much larger scale.\r\n\r\nHenry had evidently quite a reasonable desire to improve the\r\nsurroundings of his Palace at Whitehall, and no wonder. A Leper\r\nHospital and a swamp were neither desirable nor healthy adjuncts to a\r\nRoyal dwelling. Some kindly citizens of London had in the early days of\r\nthe city endowed a hospital for the accommodation of fourteen sisters\r\nsuffering from this cruel disease. They gave two hides of land, and\r\ndedicated the charity to St. James. With various later gifts, the\r\nhospital had acquired by the reign of Henry VIII. over 480 acres of\r\nland, and a Brotherhood had been established in connection with it. By\r\na grant of Henry VI. the control of the Hospital and Brotherhood had\r\nbeen given to the authorities of Eton School. In 1532, Henry VIII.\r\nexchanged certain lands in Suffolk for those adjoining his Palace at\r\nWhitehall. He suppressed the Brotherhood and pensioned off the inmates\r\nof the Hospital; and thus, with the 100 acres secured from the monks\r\nof Westminster in the previous year, the area that stretched from\r\nWhitehall to the Manor of Hyde came into his possession.\r\n\r\nOn the site of the Hospital the King built the “Manor House of St.\r\nJames,” afterwards known as St. James’s Palace. It did not become a\r\nRoyal residence, however, until long afterwards. A new tilt-yard was\r\nlaid out close by the palace at the Mall, and bowling alleys, tennis\r\ncourts, and a cockpit between St. James’s and Whitehall added to the\r\nattractions of this Royal quarter of the town.\r\n\r\nAs time and events ripened for the dissolution of the monasteries,\r\nthe enclosure of yet more of the Church lands became an easy matter.\r\nBut a few years had passed before Henry VIII. made a still greater\r\nenlargement of his Park and hunting-ground by crossing the little\r\nTyburn stream, which had hitherto formed its boundary, and taking in\r\nthe whole of the Manor of Hide which lay beyond.\r\n\r\nWestminster was one of the few religious houses that the Tudor monarch\r\ntreated with a light hand, possibly inspired by some superstitious\r\ndread, as his father was buried in the Abbey. Instead of waiting a\r\nconvenient opportunity to seize all that the monks possessed, giving\r\nnothing in return, as was his habit, he granted in exchange for Hide,\r\nlands that had previously belonged to the Priory of St. Mary, Hurley,\r\nBerks.\r\n\r\nThe charter of 1537 granting the Manor to the King is printed in the\r\n_Calendars of State Papers and Letters of Henry VIII._ It describes\r\nthe area surrendered to the Sovereign by the Abbot of Westminster, as\r\n“the manor of Neyte within the precinct of the water called the mote\r\n... the site of the manor of Hyde, Midd. and all lands etc. belonging\r\nto the said manor ... the Manor of Eybery, Midd. with all lands etc.\r\nreputed parts or parcels thereof....” Three years later the Monastery\r\nat Westminster was itself surrendered to the Crown, and the Abbey\r\nconverted into a Cathedral church under the governance of a Dean and\r\ntwelve Prebendaries.\r\n\r\nSo Hyde Park by successive bargainings, in which no doubt the monarch,\r\nand not the monks, had much the best of the deal, became a personal\r\npossession of the King, and in a measure has remained so ever since,\r\nthough the public have the free enjoyment of its glorious spaces.\r\nIt was far otherwise at the outset. Once in possession of his new\r\ndomain, now extended by successive additions from Whitehall to the\r\nmodern Kensington Gardens, Henry VIII. took effective steps to secure\r\nits privacy. A wooden paling was raised to keep in the deer and keep\r\nout intruders, thereby making it a park. The cotters who had tilled\r\npatches of land amidst the swamps and woodland while it belonged to the\r\nChurch were turned adrift. The whole area was given over to the chase.\r\nOfficials were appointed to the estates of Hide and Neyte. The cruel\r\nlaws of the time were applied with uncompromising vigour to preserve\r\nthe game.\r\n\r\nIn his soaring ambitions, flattered by the growth of absolute power,\r\nHenry contemplated a great Royal hunting-ground, encircling the capital\r\naway to Hampstead. It would have gratified his selfish craving for\r\nenjoyment, at whatever expense to others, and at the same time served\r\nthe yet more important purpose of curtailing the growth of the capital\r\nto dimensions he could rule by his personal will. But this gigantic\r\nencroachment on the rights of the people proved too much even for Henry\r\nVIII. and his self-willed daughter Elizabeth to accomplish.\r\n\r\nHyde Park and the adjoining lands, denuded of their few human\r\ninhabitants, must rapidly have returned to the condition of primeval\r\nforest. The streams feeding the numerous marshes doubtless attracted\r\nnumbers of wild fowl, and hawking was a popular sport. It was practised\r\non foot with a long hawking pole. King Henry loved the sport, which\r\nrequired even more energy than following the falcon’s course on\r\nhorseback. He was addicted, in spite of his size, to taking immense\r\nleaps on his pole, and there is a quaint record of an accident on one\r\nof these occasions when following the hawk over swampy ground. His pole\r\nbroke, and, failing to clear a muddy brook, the king fell headlong into\r\nthe oozy slush, where he would have been suffocated but for the aid of\r\nhis attendants. What an amusing spectacle this pompous monarch must\r\nhave made, mud-besmeared, being hauled out of the mire by his servants.\r\n\r\nMore cheerful things than hunting and death appear in the days of\r\nHenry VIII. Sometimes romance steps in. May Day games begun in early\r\nPlantagenet times were a national festival.\r\n\r\nOne can only hope that May Day in the sixteenth century was warmer than\r\nit is in the twentieth, for light muslin frocks with bare arms, and\r\nflower head-dresses, to say nothing of dancing-shoes, would be somewhat\r\ncold on modern English May Days, when we sit huddled over fires in\r\nMayfair.\r\n\r\nThese May Day festivals were more like the _Carnivals des Fleurs_ now\r\nannually held in the south of France. Cars almost smothered in flowers\r\nwere drawn by white horses. According to an account of May Day in 1517,\r\nthe Royal party had gone to Greenwich Palace to join the festivities.\r\nThe entertainment finished with the first recorded English horse-race.\r\nThe King raced his brother-in-law, the Duke of Suffolk, who—respecting\r\nhis head—wisely allowed his opponent to win: their steeds were not\r\nthoroughbreds, oh dear, no! they were Flemish dray-horses. Queen\r\nKatharine was much chagrined that she lost £2 over her wager, as she\r\nhad backed the Duke of Suffolk.\r\n\r\nBluff King Hal and his beautiful spouse Anne Boleyn passed many hours\r\nin Hyde Park. There, they disported themselves in the sunshine, and\r\nenjoyed freedom from public show and conventionality. There, they\r\nplayed at boy and girl, forgot affairs of State, and enjoyed themselves\r\nas heartily, romping along the sylvan glades, as Napoleon I. and the\r\nbeautiful Josephine on the sands at Biarritz.\r\n\r\nAnne Boleyn appears to have been a somewhat extravagant lady, for, in\r\nspite of all the gorgeous presents he showered upon her, the King paid\r\nher debts, and in 1531 still had to redeem the jewels which she had\r\npawned. Her betting propensities were enormous, and gambling parties\r\nwere her chief joy; but, after lavishing wealth upon her, Henry tired\r\nof her as he did of others.\r\n\r\nThese few words give some idea of the gorgeousness of the time, from\r\nwhich we can picture the scenes in Hyde Park:\r\n\r\n“The Queen went to the Abbey,” says Hall, “in a chariot upholstered\r\nin white and gold, and drawn by white palfreys. Her long black hair\r\nstreamed down her back and was wreathed with a diadem of rubies. She\r\nwore a surtout of silver tissue, and a mantle of the same lined with\r\nermine. A canopy of cloth-of-gold was borne over her by four knights\r\non foot. After came seven great ladies, riding on palfreys, in crimson\r\nvelvet trimmed with cloth-of-gold. In the first of these was the old\r\nDuchess of Norfolk and the Dowager Marchioness of Dorset, and in the\r\nother chariot were four Ladies of the Bedchamber. Fourteen other Court\r\nladies followed, with thirty of their waiting-maids on horseback.”\r\n\r\nIn order that he might refresh himself when tired with the chase, Henry\r\nVIII. had a banqueting-house built at Hyde. A family supper party was\r\nonce given there, of which some scant particulars are contained in a\r\nMS. preserved at Belvoir Castle.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“THE ROYAL HOUSEHOLD.\r\n\r\n“An ordinance for the kynges Majesty my lorde Princes grace, the Ladies\r\nMary and Elizabethe with divers other lordes and ladies ...

List of dishes for five\r\ncourses and ‘the voyde.’\r\n\r\n“Sooper at Hyde Parke the same daie. List of dishes for five courses.\r\n\r\n“Supper ibidem. List of dishes.”\r\n\r\nIn contemplating the luxury of these banquets, one must try to realise\r\nthe incongruities of the functions of that time. Our British mind is\r\napt, when we read of such events, to conjure up a vision of spotless\r\ndamask, glittering plate, and shining glass; beautiful flowers, set in\r\nharmonious surroundings, crowned by the advent of a well-cooked dinner;\r\nof guests with dainty manners and charming personalities.\r\n\r\nA rough, hand-woven cloth in the early sixteenth century was certainly\r\nforthcoming, and was laid on the wooden board, while the first thing\r\nthat was placed upon it was the salt-cellar—this in accordance with a\r\nprevailing superstition. Plate abounded on the Royal tables, and pewter\r\non those of the nobility. Knives and spoons were used. The guests\r\narrived in gorgeous array. The greatest delicacies appeared in wild\r\nextravagance. The walls were sometimes hung with tapestry; but instead\r\nof velvet pile carpets the shoes of these gentlefolk rested on rushes,\r\noften not too clean. And, alas! there were no forks.\r\n\r\nAlthough several forks were given to Queen Elizabeth, it is an accepted\r\nfact that she ate with her fingers. The introduction of these pronged\r\narticles was looked on as a great innovation, and one clergyman\r\npreached against them as “an insult to Providence not to touch one’s\r\nmeat with one’s fingers.” Forks were brought from Italy, and the\r\nprejudice seems to have arisen from the word “furcifer” having been\r\napplied to slaves who bore a fork, or cross of torture.\r\n\r\nWriters of the day, Ben Jonson included, held up these new-fangled\r\nimplements to ridicule, and they did not come into general use for\r\nwell-nigh a hundred years. As fingers were so much in favour the Ewerer\r\nattended to the provision of water and towels before and after each\r\nmeal. The office came into prominence in the reign of Edward IV., and\r\nso important had it become in that of Elizabeth that she employed a\r\nsergeant, three yeomen, two grooms, two pages, and three clerks in her\r\nEwrie. The custom was kept up to the middle of the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nIn his curious Essays _On Behaviour at Meals_, Erasmus reminds his\r\nreaders that it is “very rude to blow your nose on the table-cloth,” or\r\n“to wipe your fingers on your neighbour’s coat.” And then he goes on to\r\nremark:\r\n\r\n“Never praise the results of your cook’s labours or press your guests\r\nto eat whether they like or not. Never criticise your host’s dinner\r\nunfavourably, even if it be badly cooked. Pass all these things over in\r\nsilence. Do not give dogs your bones to crack under the table, or feed\r\nthe cat, or encourage animals to jump on the table. This may offend\r\nyour host, or lead to the soiling of his carpet,” and, above all, “do\r\nnot lick your plate; it is an act that ill becomes a cat, let alone a\r\ngentleman!”\r\n\r\nSome writers aver that until Elizabeth’s reign stews and hashes were\r\nthe chief dishes. She it was who adopted the use of large joints, and\r\nthe advent of the fork followed. Stews were eaten with spoons, but\r\nlumps of meat required other handling. Still, this theory scarcely\r\nstands against the records of feasts in earlier days, when the Saxons\r\nand Normans each had his knife and hacked from the roast itself.\r\n\r\nHyde Park, the cradle of manners, shared the favour of Henry in\r\nconjunction with similar pleasure-lands. Around London lay the parks\r\nof Richmond, Windsor, Hanworth, Hampton Court (after the death of\r\nWolsey), and, farther afield, Oatlands, besides other Royal demesnes,\r\nwhile Greenwich had been a Royal Palace from the time of Edward I.—and\r\nGreenwich, his birthplace, he loved best of all.\r\n\r\nThe expenses of Henry VIII.’s Court were prodigious, including the\r\nsalaries and expenses of such people as the officers of State,\r\nprelates, esquires, physicians, astrologers, astronomers, secretaries,\r\nushers, cupbearers, carvers, servers, madrigal singers, and choir\r\nboys, virginal players, Italian singers, and a complete orchestra of\r\nmusicians who played upon the rebeck, the lute, the sackbut, and all\r\nmanners of musical instruments. There were three battalions of pages,\r\nall dressed in the most gorgeous costumes; in fact, it is said that\r\nHenry’s retinue numbered over a thousand persons, for which the State\r\npaid £56,000 per annum, a sum equivalent to a much larger amount in\r\nthese days.\r\n\r\nAll this sounds rather appalling, but still the beauty of the costumes\r\nand gorgeous pageantry must have added to the beautification of London.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HENRY VIII.]\r\n\r\nHenry stopped at nothing. His Yeomen of the Guard were even more\r\nmagnificent than the rest. They rode immediately behind the King, and\r\ntheir horse-cloths, made of cloth-of-gold, cost £5 a yard.\r\n\r\nOne of the prettiest sights in London to-day is that of the Guards\r\nriding through Hyde Park to Buckingham Palace for a Court, or some\r\nother grand festival. The sunlight on their clothes looks almost as if\r\ntheir uniforms were made of gold as they glint in the rays; and I well\r\nremember as a child being puzzled as to how the golden men carrying the\r\nbig drums ever managed to guide their horses with the reins attached to\r\ntheir feet.\r\n\r\nThe wild freedom of the Park continued under Henry’s youthful son,\r\nEdward VI., who there entertained foreigners of distinction with hunts\r\nand banquets. A special banqueting house was erected for the French\r\nAmbassador, Marshal St. André, who was received with Royal distinction.\r\nThrough the kindness of the Marquis of Salisbury, I am able to give the\r\ndescription of this building, preserved in the MSS. at Hatfield:\r\n\r\n“The Charges and the proporcyon as well of the banketing howse newlye\r\nerected in hyde parcke agaynste the commyng of marchiall Sainte\r\nAndrowes wᵗʰ all thinges longynge to the same as also for the makyng of\r\ndyvers Stondynges in the said hide parcke and also in Marybone parke as\r\nit shall appere here after begynnyng the vjth Daye of Julie and endyng\r\nthe xxviiith of the same in Anᵒ vᵗᵒ RRs Edward vjᵗⁱ as yt Apperith by\r\nthe bookes of particulers for the same.”\r\n\r\n  Hide\r\n  Parke\r\n\r\n  Imprimis the banketing howse in\r\n  hid parke conteynyng in length\r\n  lxij foote in wydeth xxj foote/ the\r\n  Stayers cont one waye lx foote\r\n  and thother waye xxxᵗⁱ wᵗʰ a\r\n  greate towrett over the halpase.\r\n\r\n  Item made there three Ranges\r\n  if bryke for Rosting and Furneces\r\n  for boylyng.\r\n\r\n  Item All kynde of Tabulles formes\r\n  Trestelles dressers Russhis Floʳˢ wᵗʰ\r\n  suche lyke for the Furnyshing of\r\n  the banketyng howse and bankett.\r\n\r\n  Item in the said parke were made\r\n  three small standynges of a foote\r\n  thone waye and viij foote thother\r\n  waye of every of them.\r\n\r\n  Maribon\r\n  Parke\r\n\r\n  Item made in Marybone parke\r\n  one standing conteynyng in Length\r\n  xl foote and in bredth xviij foote/\r\n  The flowre is jestide and boorded\r\n  and the Reste is Skaffold poles.\r\n\r\n  Item in the said park three small\r\n  standinges of x foote long and viij\r\n  foote wyde every of them.\r\n\r\n  Charges\r\n\r\n  The hole charges of the sad banketing\r\n  house and standynged in bothe\r\n  the said parkes wᵗʰ all thinges to\r\n  them belongyng Amontith to cccclˡⁱ\r\n  ixˢ viiᵈ wherof Recevyd the vijth\r\n  of Julie ij dayes before the procly\r\n  macyon uppon preste after the\r\n  Rate then cxxxiijˡⁱ vj viijᵈ, which\r\n  wase sence payd at sondrye tymes\r\n  for cxiiijˡⁱ xvjˢ xᵈ And so Remaynith\r\n  to be Recevid.\r\n\r\n  cccxxxvˡⁱ xijˢ ixᵈ.\r\n\r\nSir THOMAS CAMERDEN to Sir WILLIAM CECIL.\r\n\r\n  “After most hertie Comendacons It may like yoᵘ to understande/ that\r\n  the same tyme the Marshall of Saint Andrewes was here, I was willed\r\n  by the Counsaill to se a Banketting howse and sondry standinges\r\n  wᵗʰ all the furniture requisite therunto prepared at hyde and\r\n  Maryboon parkes/ wᶜʰ were doon accordingly/ And the Surveioʳ wᵗʰ the\r\n  Comptrolleʳ of the Kinges Maᵗᵉˢ workes to furnishe me wᵗʰ men and all\r\n  other necessaryes for the same/ at wᶜʰ time the Surveior Laurence\r\n  brodshawe (noiated [nominated] by the Lord Winchester) was then\r\n  appointed to se the Solucons of the premisses/ wherunto he Receyved\r\n  (as I understande) by a warrant from the said Lordes) the Summe of\r\n  twoo hundreth Markes/ in the bestowing wherof I was not pryvey/\r\n  nor yet to the making of their bookes/ but by a Docket of a grosse\r\n  Summe/ wᶜʰ doth not agree wᵗʰ the particulars taken to the Clercke\r\n  of the Tentes and Revelles (as by him I understande) by the summe of\r\n  nyne poundes and more by what meanes I knowe not/ for that I have\r\n  not seen/ nor can gett their booke of particulars to peruse/ wherby\r\n  having perfytt notice of all thinges doon to Hyde Parke I might\r\n  conferre the bookes together/ and subscrybe the same/ that the poore\r\n  artificers were discharged wᶜʰ verely I thought had been fully paide\r\n  or thir tyme/ for that the Surveioʳ was fully appointed thereunto/\r\n  and I but only to se the same doon and furnished accordinglye.\r\n  And whereas they looke (as I conjecture) I shuld put my handes to\r\n  their doinges (wherunto I can not be made pryyve) I thinke it for\r\n  diverse respectes not convenyent/ of one thinge I assure yoᵘ/ I never\r\n  receyved one peny for the same hytherto/ and yet was it chargeable\r\n  besydes my paynes unto me/ Sʳ if any things be in these partes/\r\n  wherein I may do yoᵘ pleasʳ I shall want of my good will, then yoᵘ\r\n  therfor.

The very idea of\r\nher as a Society personage seems grotesque.\r\n\r\n“Bloody Mary” she was in her own time, and as such she will probably\r\nalways be known. She rarely went far afield, and her only association\r\nwith Hyde Park seems to have been the unusual number of people she\r\nhanged at Tyburn.\r\n\r\nThe park was still far remote from the town. Streets did not creep\r\nup to its precincts until quite a century and a half later. When Sir\r\nThomas Wyatt marched with his rebels upon London, his ordnance was\r\nplanted at Hyde Park Corner, and his men occupied the fields where now\r\nstand Grosvenor Square and the neighbourhood to the south.\r\n\r\nIt must be recollected that Sir Thomas Wyatt had raised his standard\r\nin Kent to protest against the Spanish marriage of Queen Mary. He had\r\ntravelled slowly towards London after defeating the Queen’s forces at\r\nRochester Bridge. He had wasted much time at Blackheath; and when at\r\nlast (3rd February 1554) Wyatt and his army appeared in Southwark, they\r\nfound the Queen and the citizens of London prepared, and London Bridge\r\nclosed and fortified. He remained at Southwark shooting impotently and\r\ntrying to get into London, until the 5th, when he started to march to\r\nthe next bridge up the river (Kingston-on-Thames). The weather was\r\nwet and miry, Wyatt’s men disheartened, and he inept as a commander.\r\nThey found Kingston Bridge broken and had to ferry across. They then\r\nmarched all night through the rain without food, and, tired and wet,\r\nreached Hyde Park Corner early in the morning of the 7th. He posted\r\nhis main body across the road at Hyde Park Corner, whilst the Queen’s\r\nforces were set at the top of the opposite hill where Devonshire House\r\nnow stands. Wyatt himself, with five companies of men, seems to have\r\nturned down what is now Grosvenor Place, and to have gone along the\r\nMall towards Charing Cross, a part of his men under Vaughan dividing\r\nfrom them and going towards Westminster, the object apparently being to\r\nattack Whitehall on both sides, from Charing Cross and from Westminster.\r\n\r\nIn an extract from the _Diary of a Courtier_ (Sir E. Peckham,\r\nprobably), published by the Camden Society, the following passage\r\noccurs:\r\n\r\n“Here was no small ado in London, and likewise the Tower made great\r\npreparation of defence. By 10 of the clocke or somewhat more, the\r\nEarle of Pembroke had set his troopp of horsemen on the hill in the\r\nhighway above the new bridge, over against St. James, his footemen\r\nwas set in 2 battailes somewhat lower and nearer Charing X ... his\r\nordnance being posted on the hill side. In the mean season Wyatt and\r\nhis company planted his ordnance upon the hill beyond St. James over\r\nagainst the Park Corner; and himself after a few words spoken to his\r\nsoldiers came down the olde Lane on foot, hard by the Court Gate of\r\nSt. James, with 4 or 5 ensigns, Cuthbert Vaughan and about 2 ensigns\r\nturned down towards Westminster. The Earle of Pembroke hovered all this\r\nwhile without moving, until all was passed by, saving the tayle, upon\r\nwhich they dyd sett and cut off. The other marched forward and never\r\nstayed or returned to the ayde of their tayle. The great ordnance shott\r\noff freshly on bothe sydes. Wyatt’s ordnance over shott the troope\r\nof horsemen. The Queen’s ordnance one piece struck three of Wyatt’s\r\nCompany in a rank upon their heads and slaying them, struck through the\r\nwall into the (Hyde) Park. More harm was not done by the great shott of\r\nneither partie. The Queen’s hole battaile of footmen standing stille,\r\nWyatt passed along the wall towards Charing X, and here the said\r\nhorsemen that were there, set upon part of them but were soone forced\r\nback.”\r\n\r\nAn account of this is also given in an extract from Brit. Mus. MSS.\r\nAdd. 15215:\r\n\r\n“And so came (Wyatt) that day toward St. James felde where was the\r\nEarle of Pembroke the Queen’s lieutenant, and my lord Privy Seal (the\r\nEarl of Bedford) and my Lord Paget, and my Lord Clynton which was Lord\r\nMarshal of the camp, with dyvers other Lords on horsebacke—which Lord\r\nClynton gave the charge with the horsemen by the Park Corner about\r\n12 of the clocke that day, and Wyatt so passed himself with a small\r\ncompany towards Charing X.”\r\n\r\n_Machyn’s Diary_ (Camden Society) records this battle of Hyde Park as\r\nwell:\r\n\r\n“The 7th day of February in the forenoon Wyatt with his army and\r\nordnance were at Hyde Park Corner. There the Queen’s host met him with\r\na great number of men at arms on horseback besides foot. By one of\r\nthe clock the Queen’s men and Wyatt’s had a skirmish; there were many\r\nslain, but Master Wyatt took the way down by St. James’s with a great\r\ncompany and so to Charing Cross.”\r\n\r\nHyde Park saw brighter scenes under Elizabeth. Splendour and pageantry\r\nmarked the age. The Parks, like everything else, were used for purposes\r\nof ostentatious display, with greater frequency than had been the case\r\nunder Henry VIII. Hyde Park remained a close Royal preserve, but the\r\ngeneral public began to see more of it.\r\n\r\nAmong other traits of her father, the Queen inherited his love of\r\nhunting, and herself killed deer in the Royal parks, as also on her\r\nstately progresses through the country when visiting her favourite\r\nnobles. Sometimes she stayed at Westminster, and made hunting\r\nexpeditions from there to Hanworth and Oatlands. Lord Hunsdon, her\r\ncousin, she appointed Keeper of Hyde Park, in which office he received\r\nan allowance of fourpence a day, with the “herbage, pannage, and browse\r\nwood for deer.” During his tenure, 1596, the first review was held in\r\nthe Park.\r\n\r\nOf course, the visits to England of Elizabeth’s many admirers were\r\nmade occasions for grand doings, hunts being enjoyed at the outlying\r\nparks of Hampton Court, Windsor, and also in Hyde Park. When John\r\nCasimir, Count Palatine of the Rhine and Duke of Bavaria, came over, he\r\nwas entertained right royally, and Hyde Park was the scene of a great\r\nhunting party. It is related that the favoured guest “killed a barren\r\ndoe with his piece, amongst three hundred other deer.”\r\n\r\nIndeed, the confines of Hyde Park were kept pretty busy with hunts and\r\nexecutions, sometimes one, sometimes the other; for the great Queen had\r\nthe Tudor abruptness of method in dealing with undesirable busybodies.\r\nThere must have been many days, indeed, when Elizabeth rode with\r\ncourtly grace along the paths, listening to the flatterer’s tongue,\r\ncoquetting with one of her many suitors, her courtiers thronging\r\naround their Royal mistress, while just through field and wood some\r\nfellow-creature was ending his earthly career by her decree at Tyburn.\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1581, Count John of Emden and Count Waldeck came to see the\r\nRoyal lady, Elizabeth demanded from Lord Hunsdon a report respecting\r\nthe game in Hyde Park, and was not at all pleased with the result.\r\nWhether birds and beasts increased thereafter is not told. A year later\r\nstands were erected in Marybone and Hyde Park for the Queen and her\r\nvisitor and suitor, the Duke of Anjou, with his train, to view the\r\nchase. Probably, however, the results of the various hunting parties\r\nwere unsatisfactory, for a record still exists among the State Papers\r\nof a command by Queen Elizabeth to the cooks of London as to the buying\r\nand selling of venison, forbidding them to purchase from unauthorised\r\npeople in the city.\r\n\r\nIt was evidently supposed that the cooks were the chief offenders in\r\nthe matter, and ordered their venison at a cheap rate purloined from\r\nher Majesty’s preserves. On 11th June 1585 we find Sir Thomas Pullyson,\r\nLord Mayor of London, writing to Walsingham:\r\n\r\n  “Right Honourable,\r\n\r\n“Here yesterday I received this from Her Majesty’s most honorable prime\r\n[minister] advertising me that her Highness was informed that venison\r\nthat was ordinarily sold by ye cookes of London was often stole—To the\r\ngreat destruction of the game—Commanding me thereby to take severall\r\nbondes of —— the yeere of all the cookes in London not to buy or sell\r\nany venison hereafter uppon payne of forfayture of the same bondes;\r\nneither to receive any venison to bake without keeping note of their\r\nnames that shall deliver the same unto them. Whereupon presently I\r\ncalled the wardens of the Cookes before me, advertising them each.\r\nRequiring them to raise their whole company to appeare befor me to the\r\nend I might take bondes.”\r\n\r\nThe bond was a surety of £40 each—an enormous sum in those days—given\r\nby each cook not to sell any manner of venison in or outside of the\r\nCity. It is rather amusing to find that the theft of venison from the\r\nRoyal Park was so highly punished in Elizabethan times, but the bond\r\ndid not do away with poaching. How those old cooks would smile if they\r\ncould see the pheasants, grouse, and partridges on sale in the best\r\nLondon shops, almost before there has been time for the cartridges to\r\nbe fired on the opening days appointed by law, still less for the game\r\nto reach the London market.\r\n\r\nCoaches came in with Elizabeth. There was no fashionable chronicler\r\nof the day to tell us exactly which were the favourite resorts of\r\nSociety, but it would not be surprising if the rough roads cut in the\r\nspacious parks which extended so far from Whitehall were first put to\r\nuse for carriage exercise by Elizabeth’s courtiers. Hyde Park has been\r\nthe fashionable drive for centuries. One likes to think of those bumpy\r\nold contrivances, of colossal weight and build, with the stoutness of\r\na farmer’s cart, as setting the fashion of driving in the park which\r\nhas come down unbroken to the present year of grace. These vehicles\r\nafforded Elizabeth’s beruffed gallants and gorgeously attired dames\r\nan opportunity of airing themselves, and probably gave them as much\r\npleasure, lumbersome though they were, as smart-horsed victorias and\r\nelectric landaulettes give their occupants to-day.\r\n\r\nThat Hyde Park was looked upon as a rural resort for the courtiers and\r\nothers who wished for greater seclusion than was to be found in St.\r\nJames’s Park, is shown in Major Martin Hume’s _Calendar of Spanish\r\nState Papers of Elizabeth_ (Record Office).\r\n\r\n“Count de Feria writes to Philip II. from London, 19th March 1559:\r\n\r\n“Since I wrote on the 6th instant I have had a long conversation\r\nwith the Treasurer of the Household (_i.e._ Sir Thomas Parry) about\r\nreligious affairs, and the obligations that the Queen and the country\r\nowe to your Majesty. He is not so good a Catholic as he should be, but\r\nhe is the most reasonable of those near the Queen. She knew that he\r\nwas coming to St. James’s Park on that day to speak with me; and she\r\ntold him to ask me to go with him to another Park higher up nearer the\r\nexecution place, so that the Earl of Pembroke and other gentlemen would\r\nbe walking in St. James’s Park might not see us together. The Earl and\r\nthe others who were walking there would have been just as shy of being\r\nseen with me, by the Queen or the Treasurer. I say this to show how\r\nsuspicious and distrustful they are.”\r\n\r\nIt was easy enough to take a drive in Hyde Park, but when the Queen\r\nmoved farther afield, even for such a short distance as the seven or\r\neight miles from Chelsea to Richmond, the arrangements required more\r\nattention. Preserved in the Records of the Stationers’ Company is the\r\nfollowing letter:\r\n\r\n  “By the Mayor,\r\n\r\n  “To the Wardens of the Companye of Stationers.\r\n\r\n  “Where the Quene’s most excellente Majestie intendith in her Royal\r\n  psonne to repair to her Princelie Palace of Whitehall, on Thursdaie\r\n  next, in thafternoone; and for that I and my brethren thaldermen\r\n  are commanded to attend on her Majesties psonne from Chelsey to\r\n  the Whitehall; Theis therefore in her Majestie’s name to require\r\n  you, that yourselfes, with six of the comliest psonages of your\r\n  said Companye, be readie at the Parke Corner above Sainte James, on\r\n  horseback, apparelled in velvette coats with chaynes of gold on\r\n  Thursdaie by twoo of the clocke, in the afternoone, to waite upon\r\n  me and my brethren the Aldermen to Chelsey for the recreating her\r\n  Majestie accordinglie. And also that you provide sixe staffe torches\r\n  lighth as need shall be required. Not failinge hereof, as you will\r\n  answere the contrarie at your perill.\r\n\r\n  “From the Guyldhall, this 28th of Januarie, 1588-9.\r\n\r\n  “SEBRIGHTE.”\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on 30th “January 1588-9” (one may learn from Nichols) the\r\nQueen “travelled from Richmond to Chelsea and so to Westminster, and\r\nthe Mayor, Aldermen, and Commoners of her Citie of London, in coates of\r\nvelvet and chaines of golde, all on horsebacke, with the Captaines of\r\nthe Cittie, to the number of fortie, betwixt five or six of the clock\r\nat torchlight.”\r\n\r\nForeigners say we English take our pleasures sadly; and so we do in\r\nthis rushing age. It is well, therefore, that we are being made to\r\nrealise what the pageantry of ancient times really meant when our land\r\nwas known as “Merrie England.”\r\n\r\nLatterly, our so-called “pageants” have been very tame—a few Venetian\r\nmasts, some tawdry paper flowers, a little stained bunting, a multitude\r\nof dirty flags of all descriptions, and the route is ready.\r\n\r\nThis tinsel display reached such a pitch in America, that a few years\r\nago an order was made forbidding tawdry decorations, and nothing is\r\nallowed but flags—a perfect sea of flags. It so chanced that I was in\r\nAmerica during the last two Presidential campaigns, and both in New\r\nYork and Chicago there were thousands, yes, tens of thousands of flags\r\narranged most beautifully and producing a wonderful effect: nothing\r\nmore majestic could be imagined, even sky-scrapers looked less hideous.\r\nThe appearance of our quaint old English streets on such occasions\r\ncould be much improved by such a systematic arrangement, instead of\r\nfestoons of damp and draggled pink and green tissue paper we call\r\ndecoration.\r\n\r\nIn olden times the houses along the route of a pageant were hung with\r\nsilks, brocades, and costly cloths. The City Companies marched in\r\ngorgeous array along the ill-kept roads, which at an early date were\r\ngravelled for the honoured one to pass, just as they are sanded to-day\r\nfor a Royal procession. The Tyburn waters were checked at the Conduits,\r\nand wine—red and white—flowed from them as the goodly company paced by\r\nwith stately mien. At every landmark along the route were stationed\r\ngroups of citizens in symbolic costumes. Each forming in itself a\r\npicture.\r\n\r\nEvery movement of Royalty was accompanied by pageantry, a very\r\ndifferent state of affairs from these modern days, when the King of\r\nEngland hires a hansom off the rank, or the Prince of Wales strolls\r\nthrough the streets alone shopping. Edward VII. steps into his motor\r\nat Buckingham Palace absolutely unheeded by anyone, and starts for\r\nNewmarket. His life, except for public functions, is that of a private\r\ngentleman; big displays are few and far between, and even then\r\nseldom, if ever, reach the gorgeousness of olden times. Maybe our\r\nancestors would be surprised at the great length of route traversed by\r\npresent-day Royal personages in their Progresses, for it must be borne\r\nin mind that the pageants of old relate to a very limited London.\r\n\r\nApart from coronations, many records remain of mediæval pageantry.\r\nEdward I., on his return from Palestine in 1274, found wine pouring\r\nfrom the Conduits, and handfuls of gold and silver were showered upon\r\nhim as he passed. A little girl, dressed as an angel in spotless white,\r\nhanded wine from the Conduit in Chepe to Richard II. and his Queen;\r\nHenry V., after his victory at Agincourt, was greeted at the north end\r\nof London Bridge by an “angelic host,” and another “heavenly choir” was\r\nstationed in Chepe, while virgins blew golden leaves upon him. When the\r\nchild-king Henry VI. arrived in London from France in 1432, Enoch and\r\nElias addressed him, while Nature, Grace, and Fortune, each attended by\r\nfourteen Virgins, showered gifts upon him.\r\n\r\nBut to Elizabeth belongs the crowning point of perfection in pageantry.\r\nShe loved the pomp, the show, the acclamations of her people; she\r\nencouraged her subjects to vie with each other in the conception and\r\nexecution of symbolic groups, asking the meaning of, and bestowing\r\nadmiration on, the symbolic groups formed to do her honour. Charles I.,\r\nafter a sojourn in Scotland, was the hero of a pageant through London;\r\nCharles II. attended the Lord Mayor’s Show for many years, and as time\r\npassed this display was the chief remnant of those old Progresses our\r\nforbears so enjoyed.\r\n\r\nIt is strange that the outcome of the Pageant Revival at Sherborne,\r\n1904, by Louis N. Parker, the Master of Pageantry, should have heralded\r\nthe “Pageant of London” to be held in 1909. No sooner was the idea\r\nmooted than ten, nay, twenty, thousand people came forward to take the\r\nparts selected.\r\n\r\nThe love of display is inherent in human nature. The Chinese, the\r\nGreeks, the Romans, and the savage of to-day all in turn have enjoyed\r\nbeating drums, flaring torches, and “dressing up.” A revival such as we\r\nare having in London is of the greatest value. The man in the street at\r\nSherborne, Warwick, St. Albans, Oxford, Bury St. Edmund’s, all learnt\r\nsomething of the history of their own towns through the pageants which\r\nhave lately taken place in their midst.\r\n\r\nThese revivals in pageantry are a great history lesson, and as\r\nimproving to the adult mind as the picture-book is to the child. We\r\nrealise so much quicker what we see than what we hear or read.\r\n\r\nPoor Elizabeth. Stout-hearted as any man when large matters of State\r\ncalled for her decision, and yet essentially feminine in her love of\r\ndress, her vanity, and coquetry. Dress became a truly serious burden\r\nof expense in her day, and she wisely regulated it by sumptuary laws\r\nto encourage thrift and common-sense among the masses. Costumes were\r\nill-adapted for outdoor use, and if we could see again any of those\r\nsplendid fêtes in the Royal Park of which the Queen was the central\r\nfigure, surrounded by her gallants and grand dames, we should probably\r\nsmile at the preposterous awkwardness of everybody in that brilliant\r\ncompany, despite their magnificence. There is a wonderful picture of\r\nElizabeth at the Lodge of Trinity College, Cambridge, the residence of\r\nthe Master (Dr. Butler), wherein she appears so tightly laced as to\r\nhave no interior organs at all, and her voluminous hoops, ruff, and\r\nsleeves cover all the canvas.\r\n\r\nLargely it was outward show. Elizabeth has come down to us as a Queen\r\npossessing three thousand silken gowns and one chemise. She did not\r\nown a pair of silk stockings until 1560, when, after receiving some as\r\na gift, she insisted on always wearing silken hose, and they became\r\nuniversal. Both ladies and gentlemen wore high-heeled shoes, and\r\nsometimes the heels measured over four inches. Fans were much used,\r\npeople of rank having the handles inlaid with diamonds and precious\r\nstones, while those of the middle class adopted silver and ivory\r\nhandles. Perfume was in great vogue.\r\n\r\nHere is a vision of the Queen as we may imagine her at one of the\r\nfashionable crushes of the time:\r\n\r\n“The ruff was profusely laced, plaited, and apparently divergent from\r\na centre on the back of her neck; it was very broad, extending on each\r\nside of her face, with the extremities reposing on her bosom, from\r\nwhich rose two wings of lawn edged with jewels, stiffened with wire,\r\nand reaching to the top of her hair, which was moulded in the shape of\r\na cushion and richly covered with gems. The stomacher was strait and\r\nbroad, and though leaving the bosom bare, still formed a long waist by\r\nextending downwards; it was loaded with jewels and embossed gold, and\r\nwas preposterously stiff and formal.”\r\n\r\nMen’s ruffs never reached the extravagant size of the ladies’ attire,\r\nbut they grew to such an extent that Elizabeth considered it necessary\r\nto order that any beyond “a nayle of a yard in depth” should be\r\nclipped. The edge of the ruff was called a “piccadilly,” as may be\r\nseen in several of the earlier dictionaries, hence the name of the\r\nfashionable street abutting on Hyde Park to-day. When there were\r\npractically no houses there, a ruff shop kept by a man named Higgins\r\nexisted, and was called a “piccadilly.” Higgins is said to have made\r\nmoney, and built a row of houses to which he handed on the name. The\r\nterm “Pickadilla” is applied to this district in Gerarde’s _Herbal_,\r\nwhere it is mentioned that “the small wild buglosse” was growing on the\r\nbanks of the dry ditches “about Pickadilla.”\r\n\r\nQueen Elizabeth was so anxious that she should not be surpassed in\r\nthe beauty of her own dress, that in addition to her sumptuary laws\r\nregulating the clothes worn by the different classes of society, young\r\nand old alike, she personally snubbed anyone who she thought wore too\r\nrich a gown or too high a ruff. It is told of Lady Mary Howard that\r\nshe appeared at Court in a velvet suit richly trimmed, Her Majesty\r\nlooked at it carefully, and the next day sent privately for the robe,\r\nand, donning it herself, entered the room where Lady Mary and her\r\nother ladies were sitting. She then asked what they thought of her\r\n“new-fancied suit,” further inquiring of the owner if it were not too\r\nshort. That chagrined lady delightedly answered in the affirmative.\r\nWhereupon the Sovereign gave a sharp retort that if it was too short\r\nfor her, it was certainly too fine for Lady Mary, and she must never\r\nwear it more.\r\n\r\nOf course, as Queen Elizabeth had sandy-coloured hair, that also became\r\nthe fashion, and ladies dyed their tresses and painted their faces.\r\nThis curious old Queen, with her enamelled complexion and darkened\r\neyes, her love of dress, her endless admirers, her hard-hearted and\r\nlevel-headed administration, is reported to have danced an Irish jig\r\nonly a few days before her death.\r\n\r\nPinched and old, and yet rouged to the eyes—for she was vain to the\r\nlast—Elizabeth disappears from the scene she had so adorned, and James\r\nVI. of Scotland rides into London—in hunting costume, “a doublet,\r\ngreen as the grass he stood on, with a feather in his cap, and horn\r\nby his side”—to claim the English throne. On the way he had delayed\r\nhis progress to make two or three sporting expeditions from the great\r\nhouses at which he stayed. Clearly this was a type of monarch under\r\nwhom Hyde Park would be put to other uses than the shows and fêtes and\r\nfashionable dallyings of Elizabeth. So it quickly proved. His first\r\nact of authority over the Royal demesne was to appoint Robert Cecil,\r\nEarl of Salisbury, Keeper of Hyde Park for life, with significant\r\ninstructions. The Queen, his predecessor, being a woman, had been too\r\nlenient; he now wished closer supervision, more careful preservation of\r\nthe game, and a smart eye to be kept on poachers.\r\n\r\nHyde Park again became the closest of Royal preserves, maintained for\r\nhunting alone. An occasional passage met with in contemporary letters\r\nshows how strictly the forest laws were enforced. Osborne, writing of\r\nthis time in 1658, long after James’s death, says of the game laws\r\ninstituted by that monarch:\r\n\r\n“Nay, I dare boldly say one Man might with more safety have killed\r\nanother than a raskall-Deare; but if a Stagge had been knowne to have\r\nmiscarried, and the authour fled, a Proclamation with a description\r\nof the party had been presently penned by the Attourney-generall, and\r\nthe penalty of His Majesty’s displeasure (by which was understood the\r\nStar-Chamber) threatened against all that did abet comfort or relieve\r\nhim. Thus satyricall, or if you please Tragicall, was this sylvan\r\nPrince, against Dear-Killers and indulgent to man-slayers.”\r\n\r\nA deer was of more value than a man, and a mole was apparently of\r\nimportance. Among the State Papers is a Warrant issued the day after\r\nChristmas, 1603, authorising the Vice-Chamberlain to pay Richard\r\nHampton, _official Mole-taker_ in St. James’s Park, and the gardens and\r\ngrounds at Westminster, Greenwich, Richmond, and Hampton Court, the fee\r\nof fourpence a day and twenty shillings yearly for livery. A man had\r\njust resigned the post, which was evidently considered a lucrative one,\r\nas there were several applications for it.\r\n\r\nJames I. was a good sportsman, even down to cock-fighting, for he\r\nrestored the cockpit which Elizabeth had been at particular pains to\r\nabolish, and appointed a Cockmaster for breeding, feeding, and managing\r\nthe King’s game-cocks. But this was an occasional pastime. He enjoyed\r\nmany a manlier diversion in the excitement of the hunt, refreshing\r\nhimself between times at the Banqueting House erected in the middle\r\nof Hyde Park, with a deep draught of good sack ere he returned to\r\nthe Palace of Whitehall. When his Queen was visited by her brother,\r\nthe King of Denmark, a series of Royal entertainments were arranged\r\nfor him. In an old MS. preserved in the _Harleian Miscellany_ a full\r\ndescription of some of these occasions is given, and it may be read\r\nthat:\r\n\r\n“... In the morning very early, being Saturday (Aug. 2nd, 1606), they\r\nhunted in the park of St. James, and killed a buck. Then passed they\r\non to Hyde Park, where they hunted with great delight, spending the\r\nrest of the forenoon in following their pastime; and about the time of\r\ndinner they returned and there dined; and about four o’clock, their\r\nbarges being by commandment ready at the privy stairs, they went by\r\nwater to Greenwich.”\r\n\r\nTo the sporting proclivities of James I. we owe a _Book of Sports_,\r\nin which the Royal writer authorised all those who had been to their\r\nown parish church, to indulge in “sports on the Lord’s Day,” including\r\ndancing, archery, leaping, vaulting, May games, morrice dances, and\r\nsetting up of Maypoles; though bull and bear baiting, interludes, and\r\nbowls, were prohibited. The King ordered the book to be read in the\r\nchurches, but the Primate absolutely refused to do so. About twenty\r\nyears later, news of deer escaping from the Old Park at Wimbledon, and\r\nhaving been killed, reached Charles I. He therefore forbade any person\r\nto go into his woods carrying a gun, or engine, to take, or destroy the\r\ngame, and if any presumed _after notice given in the churches_, to come\r\nthus provided, the King would have them punished.\r\n\r\nIs it not a bit of delightful irony that the Lord’s Day Observance Act,\r\nabolishing all these revels, and under which even now tradesmen are\r\noccasionally fined for opening their shops on Sundays, was a gift to\r\nour generation from that austere monarch Charles II.?\r\n\r\nOwing, no doubt, to the strict laws for its preservation made by James\r\nI., game seems to have much increased in the forest glades and about\r\nthe marshes and rivulets in Hyde Park. Still the cooks appear to have\r\nbeen playing their old trick of trying to get venison cheap, for in\r\n1619 the State Papers have a record that two men were found shooting\r\ndeer in Hyde Park. They were captured by the keepers, and were hanged\r\nat Hyde Park Corner, as well as an unfortunate labourer whom they had\r\nemployed to hold their dogs. One wet season played havoc with the deer\r\nin “Marybone” Park—known to-day as Regent’s Park—and a warrant was\r\nissued to the Keeper of Hyde Park to send three brace of bucks to help\r\nmake up the deficiency.\r\n\r\nA quaint manuscript is in existence, recording an outlay for the upkeep\r\nof Hyde Park at this period.\r\n\r\n“An account of monneys disbursed by Sʳ Walter Cope, Knight, in his\r\nMajesties Parke called Hide Parke, from October 1611 until October 1612:\r\n\r\n“Imprimis laid out for two hundred of lime trees brought out of the\r\nLowe Countries at ten shillings the peece amounts unto twentie poundes;\r\nwᶜʰ were planted along the walkes in the places of those that were\r\ndecaied. Also for mending the pondheads and gravelling them, being\r\nspoiled by the floudes in the winter. Also for reparacions about the\r\nlodges, the Parke pale, the standinges, and charges for making the haie\r\nfor the deere twentie marks. All wᶜʰ amounts unto 33 li.\r\n\r\n  (Signed) “WALTER COPE.”\r\n\r\nAn order for the payment of these moneys follows in the handwriting of\r\nthe Earl of Suffolk of the day.\r\n\r\nWith all his usurpations and vagaries and the pedantry of a narrow\r\nmind, one retains a lingering fondness for James I. He was the last of\r\nthe line of British monarchs, going back to the earliest feudal times,\r\nwith whom the love of hunting the wild animal in his native glades\r\nremained an absorbing passion. When he passed the way of all men Hyde\r\nPark underwent a great change. It ceased to be a close game preserve,\r\nand became for the first time a real centre of social enjoyment, such\r\nas we still find it. In the wilder parts hunting was practised, but\r\nCharles I. seems to have thrown the park—or at least a large part of\r\nit—open to all comers, with few limitations.\r\n\r\nWith the ill-fated Stuart King, rather than with Henry VIII., the park\r\nas a place of popular resort really begins.\r\n\r\nLife out of doors became more safe, people took more pleasure in going\r\nabout, locomotion became easier and money circulated more freely.\r\nAs the fashionable world began to take the air farther afield than\r\nSt. James’s Park and Pall Mall, more keepers, more lodges, and more\r\naccommodation were required in Hyde Park. Mention is made in the\r\nState Papers that on 20th November 1635, £800 was paid for building a\r\nnew lodge in Hyde Park; and three years later there was a payment of\r\n£1123, 5s. 5d. for further work done at the new lodge, according to the\r\nestimate of the famous architect, Inigo Jones.\r\n\r\nThe area of the Park in which the fashion and beauty of Stuart London\r\nmostly foregathered was that which in after years became famous as “The\r\nRing,” the precursor of modern racing.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CHEESECAKE HOUSE.      _Print from “The Gentleman’s Magazine.”_\r\n\r\n_Where Society partook of syllabub, and the Duke of Hamilton was\r\ncarried mortally wounded._]\r\n\r\nFrom before the Restoration until far into the Georgian period it\r\nremained the great resort of all the _beau monde_. The site lay to\r\nthe north of the present Serpentine, close by the ground now enclosed\r\nin the Ranger’s private gardens. Such a space—only 300 yards in\r\ndiameter—seems too limited to be the rendezvous for the votaries of\r\nfashion, when we think of the crowds in Hyde Park to-day. But Society\r\nwas then but a fraction of what the term represents in our time, and\r\nit will be seen that this was the case even after the Ring had long\r\ndisappeared. The new tea-house to be opened about 1908, under the\r\nauspices of Mr. L. Harcourt, will stand upon the south-western corner\r\nof the “Ring.” It seems a pity that part of Crosby Hall, anyway the old\r\nbanquetting hall, could not have been utilised for this object. By such\r\nmeans one of the most historical spots in London would have been kept\r\nin our midst. It would be curious should fashion again migrate to the\r\nspot which to Pepys and other gossips, two and a half centuries ago,\r\nwas the centre of all the town’s attractions.\r\n\r\nA lodge, built of timber and plaster and probably erected in the reign\r\nof James I., stood near by the Ring. It was first known as “Grave\r\nMaurice’s Head,” and there the people frequenting the Park obtained\r\nrefreshment. It figures as “The Lodge” in Pepys’ accounts of his\r\noutings, but later was known as the Cheesecake House, probably from the\r\nfact of that special viand being sold there; another name was the “Lake\r\nHouse.”\r\n\r\nThere, amid the greenery, the gay world thronged. Cavaliers with\r\nwaving plumes, some riding with spurs and swords, others in their new\r\nequipages, while bright-eyed ladies accompanied them to watch the races\r\nand the crowd. Gay gallants courted pretty wenches, smart diplomatists\r\ndropped secrets in the ears of beautiful women. Love-making and court\r\nintrigues were hatched in Hyde Park, and many a romance, many a comedy,\r\nwas unfolded under the shade of the trees.\r\n\r\nOf the social life of the times in which Hyde Park now began to play\r\nan important part, there is a delightful picture in a letter from one\r\nMrs. Merricke to Mrs. Lydall, written on 21st January 1638. It is very\r\nmodern in sentiment, although written nearly three hundred years ago.\r\nThe poor lady was most anxious about her personal appearance, even\r\nin bed, and equally distressed that her library consisted of only two\r\nbooks. The letter runs:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLetter from Mrs. Merricke to Mrs. Lydall, 21st January 1638.\r\n\r\n  “Faire Mrs. Lydall,\r\n\r\n  “For soe my owne eyes bid mee call you, whilst others happie in a\r\n  neerer familiaritie intitle you wife, sister, sweetehart, chayce\r\n  conceite or the like: give me leave in this rude paper to present\r\n  my service, and humblie to begg a boone of you: ’Tis the felicitie\r\n  of your place to bee neere the person of my honourable Lady; and\r\n  ’tis not unknowne how lovelie and solitarie the countrie at this\r\n  tyme is, soe tedious indeede to mee (whoe have ever lived among\r\n  good companie) that longer than the springe I shall never be able\r\n  to indur’t.

The gay and frivolous George Villiers, Duke of\r\nBuckingham, was wont to trip along in all his frills and frippery,\r\nor sitting stately in his coach drawn by six horses, joking with\r\nKing Charles, and urging the monarch to some fresh imprudence. Many\r\nlooked darkly on the silly intercourse between these two men. Charles,\r\nclinging to the ambitions of his powerful minister, with the obstinacy\r\nof a weak and incapable nature, was far advanced on the way to the\r\nscaffold, when John Fenton,—mixing with the crowds assembled at\r\nPortsmouth to witness Buckingham’s departure for France,—stabbed the\r\nfavourite to the heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Queen Henrietta Maria’s Penance at Tyburn beneath the\r\n“Triple Tree.”\r\n\r\n_From an old Print in the Crowle Collection, British Museum._]\r\n\r\nAn incident of which much has been made, and which there is little\r\nreason to doubt was grossly exaggerated by the religious bigots of the\r\ntime, associated Charles’s Queen, Henrietta Maria, with Hyde Park.\r\nThe early years of his French marriage were certainly not happy, the\r\nmeddling household of the Queen’s French attendants and Catholic\r\npriests being responsible for the luckless monarch’s domestic broils.\r\nHis fierce hatred of their interference obtains expression in a letter\r\nto Buckingham, by virtue of which the lot were “sent packing.” It is\r\naddressed to his “faithful, constant, loving friend Steenie”:\r\n\r\n“I command you to send all the French away to-morrow out of the towne,\r\nif you can by fair meanes (but stike not long in disputing), otherwise\r\nforce them away, dryving them away lyke so manie wilde beasts, until\r\nye have shipped them, and so the devil goe with them. Let me heare no\r\nanswer, but of the performance of my command.”\r\n\r\nWhatever his subsequent weakness, Charles I. was at least in early\r\nyears of kingship a forceful letter-writer.\r\n\r\nShortly before this missive was dispatched, the King had been moved\r\nto intolerable anger by the accounts presented to him of the infamous\r\ntreatment of his Queen by her Popish entourage. In the early summer of\r\n1626, Henrietta had asked to spend a certain time in retirement and\r\ndevotion. After a quiet day passed in the services of her church at\r\nthe chapel in St. James’s Park, she turned into Hyde Park, directing\r\nher walk towards Tyburn, whether by intention or not remains unknown.\r\nIn any case, it was quite probable that, especially impressed by her\r\nreligious seclusion, she bethought herself of those who, not so many\r\nyears before, had suffered as martyrs on that gruesome spot for the\r\nvery religion she held so dear. She knelt to pray for them, and\r\nperhaps for strength to bear her own weary lot.\r\n\r\nA week or two passed before the tale of her surreptitious visit to\r\nTyburn reached the King. He was told that the Queen had been made\r\nto walk thither barefoot as a penance, and to offer up prayers for\r\ntraitors who had ended their days on Tyburn gallows.\r\n\r\nWhitelock’s _Chronicle_ gives the Protestant version of the affair:\r\n\r\n“Distastes and jealousies were raised about the Government of the\r\nQueen’s Family; wherein the King held himself traduced by some of her\r\nFrench servants, who said that the King had nothing to do with them, he\r\nbeing an Heretick.\r\n\r\n“The Queen was brought to insist upon it, as part of the Articles, that\r\nshe should name all her servants, and some unkindness arose upon it.\r\nThe King was also distasted, that her Priests made the Queen to walk to\r\nTyburn on Penance.\r\n\r\n“Upon these Passages the King dismist, and sent back into France all\r\nthe Queen’s French Retinue, acquainting the French King with it, and\r\nexcusing it to him; but it was ill resented in France, and by them held\r\ncontrary to the Articles of Marriage.”\r\n\r\nThat this was the account generally accredited and sedulously fostered\r\nby the anti-Romish party in the State, is further shown by a letter\r\npreserved in the Harleian MSS., written by Mr. John Pory, a well-known\r\npublic man, who had been a Member of Parliament in 1610. After relating\r\nthe dismissal of the servants and priests, he says:\r\n\r\n“No longer agon then upon St. James his day last, those hippocritical\r\ndogges made the pore Queen to walke afoot (some add barefoot) from her\r\nhouse at St. James to the gallowes at Tyborne, thereby to honor the\r\nSaint of the day in visiting that holy place, where so many Martyrs\r\n(forsooth) had shed their blood in defense of the Catholic cause. Had\r\nthey not also made her to dable in the durte in a foul morning from\r\nSomersett House to St. James, her Luciferian Confessor riding allong by\r\nher in his Coach! Yea, they have made her to go barefoot, to spin, to\r\neat her meat out of tryne dishes (wooden dishes), to waite at the table\r\nand serve her servants, with many other ridiculous and absurd penances.”\r\n\r\nThere is a picture of the Queen’s penance, of which a reproduction is\r\nhere given. The Queen is seen kneeling by the triangular scaffold,\r\nwhither she has been accompanied by her Father Confessor—presumably a\r\nCardinal—in his coach and six.\r\n\r\nOf the “triple tree” itself, its origin and use, there is much to be\r\nsaid in later chapters on Tyburn.\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, when, in 1628, Charles I. raised the jointure of\r\nHenrietta Maria to £28,000, one of the manors assigned to her to\r\nproduce the additional £6000 was that of Hyde.\r\n\r\nAs already said, the Park first became under Charles I. the fashionable\r\nsociety rendezvous. Its greatest attraction, maybe, was the racing\r\nin the Ring. The occasions, when organised meetings took place, were\r\nspecial scenes of gaiety, and were evidently thought important events,\r\nas even among the State Papers there is preserved the agreement for a\r\nrace that took place there. Though admitting the public so freely, and\r\nhimself mixing among them, Charles still looked upon the Royal Park\r\nas a personal possession, and exercised his full authority within it.\r\nIt was on one of these occasions that the King, seeing a licentious\r\nBerkshire squire among the company, peremptorily ordered him out of\r\nits confines, speaking of him to the courtiers as an “ugly rascal.”\r\nThis expression the squire overheard. He went away quietly; but vowed\r\nvengeance, and gradually embittered the whole of his county against\r\nthe King. He had, indeed, his revenge, for writ large on Charles I.’s\r\ndeath-warrant was the name of the “ugly rascal.”\r\n\r\nIn the tumultuous years with which the reign closed, Hyde Park saw\r\nother scenes. There the Parliamentary troops mustered in stern array;\r\nthere Essex lay waiting with a small force the threatened attack on\r\nLondon by King Charles, who was expected to march from Oxford to seize\r\nthe capital. There came band after band of sturdy patriots to join\r\nthe Roundhead army, and General Lambert added his men to those of his\r\nchief. Raw recruits were drilled into the celebrated train-bands,\r\nand in Hyde Park Cromwell reviewed his invincible Ironsides, his own\r\nparticular force whom he had especially trained to meet the cavalry\r\nattacks of Prince Rupert.\r\n\r\nIn 1642 the inhabitants of the City of London made a large fortress\r\nwith four bastions south-east of Hyde Park, on the ground now occupied\r\nby Hamilton Place. It was from part of this erection, which was called\r\n“Oliver’s Mount,” that Mount Street, Park Lane, takes its name.\r\n\r\nThe following year, as the civil strife was still waging fierce and\r\nhot between Royalists and Roundheads, three forts were constructed on\r\nTyburn Road. It is quaint to think of impromptu fortresses built by an\r\nalarmed populace near Lancaster Gate and Oxford Street. The _Perfect\r\nDiurnal_, an invaluable record of the time, states that the anxiety\r\nof the citizens was such that thousands of men, women, servants, and\r\nchildren, many members of the Council of the City, well-known public\r\nmen, and the trained bands from the Camp, together with feltmakers,\r\nshoemakers, and other tradesmen, all worked their best in throwing up\r\nthese fortifications outside the City.\r\n\r\nSamuel Butler, in his _Hudibras_, refers to this:\r\n\r\n  “Women, who were our first apostles,\r\n  Without whose aid w’ had all been lost else;\r\n  Women, that left no stone unturned\r\n  In which the Cause might be concern’d:\r\n  Brought in their children’s spoons and whistles,\r\n  To purchase swords, carbines, and pistols;\r\n  Their husbands, cullies, and sweethearts,\r\n  To take the saints’ and church’s parts;\r\n  Drew several gifted brethren in,\r\n  That for the Bishops would have been,\r\n  And fixed them constant to the Party,\r\n  With motives powerful and hearty:\r\n  Their husbands robb’d, and made hard shifts,\r\n  T’ administer unto their gifts\r\n  All they could rap, and rend, and pilfer,\r\n  To scraps and ends of gold and silver;\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  What have they done, or what left undone,\r\n  That might advance the Cause at London?\r\n  March’d rank and file, with drum and ensign,\r\n  T’ entrench the city for defence in;\r\n  Rais’d rampires with their own soft hands,\r\n  To put the enemy to stands;\r\n  From ladies down to oyster-wenches\r\n  Labour’d like pioneers in trenches,\r\n  Fell to their pick-axes and tools,\r\n  And help’d the men to dig like moles?”\r\n\r\nThe women, and even ladies of rank and fortune, not only encouraged\r\nthe men, but worked with their own hands. Dr. Nash mentions Lady\r\nMiddlesex, Lady Foster, Lady Anne Walker, and Mrs. Dunch as having been\r\nparticularly celebrated for their activity.\r\n\r\nAgain in the _Perfect Diurnal_ of 4th January 1643, one reads:\r\n\r\n“Collonell Browne the Scotchman, upon some Complaints made against him\r\nby his Souldiers, for detaining their pay, was apprehended this day by\r\nthe Court of Guard at Hide Park, by an order from the Close Committee,\r\nand Committed to safe custody to answere the same.”\r\n\r\nSo we may conclude that all was not peace among the troops encamped in\r\nthe Park.\r\n\r\nIn the State Papers there are several references to Hyde Park, throwing\r\nsidelights on the life of the people of the day. For instance, after\r\nthe Battle of Naseby every person of consequence who had been engaged\r\nin the struggle was strictly supervised, and it was necessary for all\r\nstrangers to have a pass to enter the City of London.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Northampton, wishing to cross to Holland, secured a pass to\r\nembark from London, and arriving at the fortress at Hyde Park Corner,\r\nthen so called, but now the Marble Arch, duly handed it to the Captain\r\ncommanding the Guard. That officer, finding the Earl was accompanied\r\nby five servants while his pass only allowed four, seized one of the\r\nhorses. The Earl, detained much to his annoyance by this incident,\r\npetitioned the Committee of both Kingdoms to restore the animal. The\r\nCommittee, although commending the Captain for close observance of\r\nduty, explained that as the Earl of Northampton was going beyond the\r\nseas he would need the horse, and therefore they wished it returned.\r\n\r\nThis examination at Hyde Park must have been very searching, for in the\r\n_Perfect Diurnal_ of 5th January 1643, it is recorded that\r\n\r\n“Sir Edward Wardner, Doctor Castle of Westminster, Doctor Fuller of\r\nthe Savoy, Mr. Dinckson of Saint Clements, and some others this day\r\nset forward towards Oxford with a Petition to His Majesty for an\r\naccommodation (as is pretended); and being examined upon the way by\r\nthe Courts of Guard at Hide Parke, they produced a Warrant from the\r\nLords in Parliament for the free Passage with their Petition to His\r\nMajesty without interception. Whereupon the Captaine of the Guard told\r\nthem that though he was commanded by their Warrant to give them free\r\nPassage with their Petition, yet he would search them, that they should\r\ncarry nothing else to his Majesty, which he did accordingly, and found\r\ndivers Letters about them, especially Doctor Dinckson.”\r\n\r\nThese papers were handed to the Commons, and the Committee found them\r\nto be “of a very high and dangerous consequence.” The party, after\r\nhaving been stripped of all papers except their petition, had been\r\nallowed to proceed to Oxford, but a troop of “Dragouners” was sent to\r\nbring them back to Parliament, so back they came, done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nUNDER THE COMMONWEALTH\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as the death of Charles I. upon the scaffold under the windows\r\nof Whitehall Banqueting House left the Regicides in undisputed\r\npossession of the Royal lands, new difficulties arose.\r\n\r\nNo one knew what to do with them. Hyde Park entered upon a period of\r\nunexampled vicissitude. No doubt the sterner section of the Puritans,\r\nwho had now gained the upper hand, looked upon all the gallantries and\r\nfollies of which the Park had been a centre as so much devilment, and\r\nwould gladly have seen the place swept away.\r\n\r\nIt was a time when bartering was keen, and money sorely needed for\r\nthe service of the State. The spacious Park grounds must have been a\r\ntempting bait to offer for sale. On the other hand, a numerous body of\r\nthe citizens would have been quite content to seize the Royal Parks\r\nfor their own unrestricted use, and were strongly adverse to their\r\nbeing handed over for enclosure by the farmer or for destruction by the\r\nbuilder.\r\n\r\nFor the moment, at least, the parks were saved. About three months\r\nafter the Royal tragedy the Council took the whole matter under their\r\nconsideration, with the result that the record of their proceedings\r\ncontains the following important decision:\r\n\r\n“To report to the House that the Council think Whitehall House, St.\r\nJames’s Park, St. James’s House, Somerset House, Hampton Court, and the\r\nHome Park, Theobalds, and the Park, Windsor, and the Little Park next\r\nthe House, Greenwich House and Park, and Hyde Park, ought to be kept\r\nfor the public use of the Commonwealth, and not sold.”\r\n\r\nThe Parliament, however, undertook the care of its new acquisitions\r\nwith bad grace. It was continually selling portions of its patrimony,\r\nand where sales could not be effected it freely destroyed. Nothing\r\nseems to have been done for Hyde Park while its ultimate fate remained\r\nin suspense; meanwhile the populace used it for their own amusement.\r\nGradually the cover for game became less good as the invasion extended.\r\nNew areas were converted into grass lands.\r\n\r\nThe Park lost for ever its characteristics as a game preserve, which\r\nfor so long it had retained.\r\n\r\nWars and alarms continued to be the public state. Soon great\r\npreparations were made for Cromwell’s departure for Ireland, and a\r\ngrant was given to William Yarvell, a carriage master, to put all\r\nthe horses provided for the campaign which could not be accommodated\r\nin Marylebone into Hyde Park to graze. Again, in the following year,\r\na notice appears in the State Papers that Colonel Hammond received\r\ntwo hundred horses, and was told to turn them out to grass, but this\r\npermission was withdrawn the same year.\r\n\r\nOn Cromwell’s return to England, in the spring of 1650, from the scenes\r\nof the bloody massacres by which he had subdued Ireland, he entered\r\nLondon in triumph. When passing the old camp where he had reviewed his\r\nIronsides years before, multitudes of citizens came out to greet him.\r\nThe soldiers stationed there discharged a volley, big guns were fired,\r\nand the people shouted and cheered all the way to Whitehall.\r\n\r\nThe fate of Hyde Park did not remain long undecided.\r\n\r\nIn spite of much haggling by the Council, the vandals of Parliament\r\nsucceeded in two or three years in obtaining their own way. London\r\nlost its playground. The Park was condemned to be sold by order\r\nof Parliament in 1652, and realised about £17,000. The “eligible”\r\nproperty, as an enthusiastic auctioneer of to-day would probably\r\ndescribe it, was divided into three lots, namely:\r\n\r\n  The Gravel-pit division was bought by Richard Wilcox for £4144.\r\n\r\n  The Kensington division, bought by a merchant, John Tracy, for £3906;\r\n  and\r\n\r\n  The Middle, Banqueting, and Old Lodge Divisions were purchased by\r\n  Anthony Deane, of St. Martin’s-in-the-Fields, for £9020.\r\n\r\nOf this sum, £4899, 10s. was realised for the timber, so evidently the\r\nPark must have been thickly wooded at that time. There were also sold\r\nTyburn Meadow and the enclosed meadow-land used for the deer, which\r\nwere numerous. These animals brought in the sum of £765, 6s. 2d., the\r\nmoney being devoted to the Navy.\r\n\r\nWhat Richard Wilcox may have done with the Gravel-pit division I have\r\nnot been able to discover. Possibly he dug more gravel-pits; if so,\r\nthey have long since been filled up, and all traces have disappeared.\r\nThe pits came into the possession of a man named Orme in the nineteenth\r\ncentury, who amassed a fortune by selling gravel from them to Russia,\r\nand the money he afterwards invested in building. It is probable that\r\nOrme Square, the home of Sir Rowland Hill (father of the penny post)\r\nfor so many years, was named after him.\r\n\r\nJohn Tracy, the merchant who had secured the Kensington division,\r\nwas evidently a man of ambitions. We know that he built two houses\r\nat Knightsbridge within the Park area, from the fact that after the\r\nRestoration he mentions them specifically in his petition to Charles II.\r\n\r\nThe public purchasers of Hyde Park under the Commonwealth had never\r\nreceived any confirmation of their transaction from Parliament. From\r\nthe Royalist standpoint they were liable to arrest for having acquired\r\nCrown lands, and knowing their peril they were only too glad to restore\r\nthem to the King. The Law Courts declared the purchases annulled. Tracy\r\npleaded absence abroad, and consequent ignorance of the condition of\r\nthings in England when he made the purchase, and begged that he might\r\nbe allowed to retain the two Knightsbridge houses. King Charles, being\r\nan easy-going soul, let him have his way.\r\n\r\nAnthony Deane, who took by far the biggest share, set to work on the\r\nnotion that he could get his money back by making the people pay for\r\nwhat they had hitherto freely enjoyed. He still kept up his land as\r\na park; but a charge was made for entrance, whereat there was much\r\ndiscontent. Evelyn in his diary (April 1653) voices the universal\r\ngrumble:\r\n\r\n“I went to take the aire in Hide Park, when every coach was made to\r\npay a shilling and every horse sixpence by the sordid fellow who has\r\npurchas’d it of the State, as they were called.”\r\n\r\nThat shilling was worth about four times the present sum, so a drive\r\nwith a coach and pair was an expensive outing. Nevertheless, the Park\r\nseemed fairly popular with the fashionable world, but not so much as\r\nformerly, though necessarily more exclusive. A figure-head—a leader of\r\nfashion—was sadly needed. Besides, the times were not favourable to\r\nfestivities. Here and there passages in private letters and extracts\r\nfrom diaries permit us to peep at the social gatherings in Hyde Park\r\nin the days of the Commonwealth; but they seem to have been dull,\r\ndismal affairs, entirely lacking the abandon and freedom—not to say\r\nlicence—which set in after the Restoration.\r\n\r\nLong before this a rival promenade had been opened for Society, and,\r\nstrangely enough, in a church. After the destruction of the Monasteries\r\nthe middle aisle of St. Paul’s Cathedral became both a market-place\r\nand a common walk. When Hyde Park was taxed, and Spring Gardens closed\r\nby Act of Parliament, “Paul’s Walk” came into still greater vogue, and\r\nbetween the hours of eleven and twelve, and three and six, fashion of\r\nall grades of Society met there, for the citizens wended their way to\r\nthe Cathedral for recreation, and to show off their gowns, and chat\r\nwith their friends instead of going west.\r\n\r\nYet even the Puritans had their moments of rejoicing when the dourest\r\nof natures unbent.\r\n\r\nThe old custom of Maying, which had been abolished by the Puritans,\r\nwas revived in 1654. May Day was more generally observed than it had\r\nbeen for many years, the people “going a-Maying” to Hyde Park in large\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\nOne can easily conjure up the scene on a warm sunny day, merry,\r\ntripping, dancing, laughing maids accompanied by their swains. These\r\nyoung men were ’prentices in the City Companies, and donned their best\r\naccordingly to go “a-Maying” with their ladyloves. The same old, old\r\nstory. Cupid was, and is, as powerful as his gloomy enemy Death, and\r\njust as eternal.\r\n\r\nThere were no Bank Holidays then, but money was saved to buy finery,\r\nnew gowns were donned for the May games, and the difficulties of\r\ntransport made an outing to Hyde Park just as great a business to the\r\nworker as a trip from London to the sea is to-day.\r\n\r\nThe poles were erected; they were gaily decorated with flags,\r\nbunting, and flowers; pretty dances were performed around them, while\r\nentanglement of ribbons provoked entanglement of hearts, and all made\r\nmerry in Hyde Park on May Day.\r\n\r\nMaying began early in the morning with a service, and was looked upon\r\nas a thanksgiving festival to celebrate the advent of spring and\r\ndisappearance of winter.\r\n\r\nThese May-Day games and rejoicings had their origin in pagan festivals,\r\nand from the earliest days of England’s history they had probably been\r\na gala day for her people. In the days of Chaucer the King and Queen\r\nand their courtiers took part in them, for the poet writes:\r\n\r\n  “Forth goeth all the Court, both most and\r\n  least, to fetch the flowers fresh.”\r\n\r\nIn the sixteenth century it was customary for the middle and lower\r\nclasses to go out at an early hour to gather flowers and hawthorn to\r\nbring home at sunrise, with horn and tabor, singing and much merriment;\r\nand the Robin Hood Games, perpetuating the adventures of Robin Hood,\r\nformed a great feature in the May-Day pageants, Maid Marian, Friar\r\nTuck, Little John, and other characters disporting themselves among the\r\nMay garlands. Now that mediæval pageants are being revived all over\r\nEngland, May-Day fêtes and dances may become common again.\r\n\r\nUnder the early Stuarts May Day continued to be a great national\r\nholiday.\r\n\r\nLondon kept it in later days in a fashion of its own. Until within the\r\nnineteenth century it continued to be the festival of milkmaids and\r\nchimney-sweeps.\r\n\r\nA cow, much garlanded with flowers, was led by dairy women in light,\r\nfantastic dresses, and wreathed with flowers, who would dance round\r\nit, playing on musical instruments. Some of them used to polish up\r\ntheir tin cans, others used to hire silver articles from pawnbrokers at\r\nso much an hour. These used to be hung upon a frame which went over a\r\nman’s head and shoulders, only his legs being visible, and as he joined\r\nthe dance, he was a somewhat comical apparition.\r\n\r\nThe sweeps were the last to keep up May Day in the Metropolis. A\r\nband of them in character dress marched round the streets until\r\nthe middle of the century, accompanied by a man concealed in a\r\nhuge flower-be-trimmed frame, with a flag at the top, and known as\r\n“Jack-in-the-Green.” This march was interrupted at times by dances\r\nto a fife-and-drum accompaniment. Of course, the Act forbidding the\r\nemployment of boys and men for climbing chimneys, reduced the numbers\r\nof these chimney-sweepers, and that as much as anything led to the\r\nabolishment of their festival. During her residence in Portman Square,\r\nMrs. Montagu annually entertained the chimney-sweeps on May Day.\r\n\r\nAn old superstition that washing the face with dew on May Day was\r\nbeneficial to the complexion, existed to the end of the eighteenth\r\ncentury. Mrs. Pepys on various occasions rose at four o’clock in the\r\nmorning—and once at three—to go and wash her face in the renowned May\r\ndew—so her husband records.\r\n\r\nTo the restored May-Day scene in Hyde Park came Cromwell, then Lord\r\nProtector, and many of his Privy Councillors—strange figures for such\r\ncompany. It is told of the Protector that he looked on with keen\r\nenjoyment at a hurling-match. The game is described as “a bowling of\r\na great ball of fifty Cornish gentlemen of one side and fifty of the\r\nother; one party with red caps, and the other in white. The ball they\r\nplayed withal was silver, and designed for that party which did win\r\nthe goal.” The ancient game, from which Hurlingham, now famous for its\r\nfashion and its sports, takes its name, is still played each year at\r\nNewquay, in Cornwall.\r\n\r\nIn a “Letter from John Barber to Mr. Scudamore,” dated “London, 2 Maij,\r\n1654,” the following account of the scene is given:\r\n\r\n“Yesterday each coach (and I believe there were 1500) payed 2: 6d.,\r\nand each horse 1s., but yᵉ benefit accrewes to a brace of citizens who\r\nhave taken yᵉ herbage of yᵉ parke of Mr. Deane, to wᶜʰ they adde this\r\nexcise of beauty: there was a hurlinge in yᵉ paddock-course by Cornish\r\nGentlemen for yᵉ greate solemnity of yᵉ daye, wᶜʰ indeed (to use my\r\nLord protector’s word) was great: when my Lord protector’s coach came\r\ninto yᵉ Parke wᵗʰ Col. Ingoldsby and my lord’s daughters onely (3 of\r\nthem all in greene-a) the coaches and horses flock’d about them like\r\nsome miracle, but they gallop’d (after yᵉ mode court-pace now, and wᶜʰ\r\nthey all use where ever they goe) round and round yᵉ parke, and all\r\nyᵗ great multitude hunted them and caught them still at yᵉ turne like\r\na hare, and then made a Lane wᵗʰ all reverent hast for them, and soe\r\nafter them againe, that I never saw yᵉ like in my life.”\r\n\r\nEvelyn, still grumbling at the payment to be made, and with all the\r\ndisgust of a courtier at times so much out of joint, gives a little\r\npicture of the Park a year before King Charles II. came back to the\r\nthrone, but he can say nothing good for it.\r\n\r\n“... I did frequently in the spring accompany my Lord N. into a field\r\nnear the town, which they call Hyde Par: the place not unpleasant,\r\nand which they use as our Course: but with nothing of that order,\r\nequipage and splendour: being such an assemblage of wretched jades and\r\nhackney-coaches, as, next a regiment of carmen, there is nothing which\r\napproaches the resemblance.”\r\n\r\n“A field near the town which they call Hyde Park.” What measureless\r\ncontempt is contained in that phrase! But Evelyn lived to enjoy\r\nbrighter scenes. He proceeds:\r\n\r\n“This park was, it seems, used by the late King and nobility, for the\r\nfreshness of the air and the goodly prospect. But it is that which now,\r\nbesides all other excises, they pay for here in England; though it\r\nbe free in all the world beside: every coach and horse which enters,\r\nbuying his mouthful, and permission of the publican who has purchased\r\nit: for which the entrance is guarded with porters with long staves.\r\nThe manner is, as the company returns, to alight at the Spring Gardens,\r\nso called, in order to the Park, as our Tuilleries is to the Course.\r\nThe enclosure not disagreeable for the solemnesse of the Grove,\r\nwarbling of the birds; and as it opens into the spacious walks at St.\r\nJames’s. But the company walk in at such a rate, as you would think\r\nthe ladies were so many Atalantas, contending with their wooers: and,\r\nmy lord, there was no appearance that I should prove the Hippomenes;\r\nwho could, with very much ado, keep pace with them. But as fast as\r\nthey run, they stay there so long, as if they wanted not time to finish\r\nthe race; for it is usual here to find some of the young company till\r\nmidnight, and the thickets of the garden seem to be contrived to all\r\nadvantages of gallantry, after they have been refreshed with the\r\ncollation, which is here seldom omitted, at a certain _cabaret_ in\r\nthe middle of this paradise, where the forbidden fruits are certain\r\ntrifling tarts, neat’s tongues, salacious meats, and bad Rhenish: for\r\nwhich the gallants pay sauce, as indeed they do at all such houses\r\nthroughout England. For they think it a piece of frugality beneath\r\nthem to bargain, or account for, what they eat in any place, however\r\nunreasonably imposed on.”\r\n\r\nSuch feeble effort of would-be gallantry, at which Evelyn, himself a\r\nsomewhat precise person, so openly flouted, was yet sufficient to cause\r\npain to many good Puritans, though they were no longer able to suppress\r\nit. The other day I came across a contemporary pamphlet, by a writer\r\nwho evidently had been much agitated by these terrible doings. Its full\r\ntitle is:\r\n\r\n“The Yellow Book, or a serious letter sent by a private Christian to\r\nthe Lady Consideration, the first of May 1656, which she is desired\r\nto communicate in _Hide-Park_ to the Gallants of the Times, a little\r\nafter Sun-set; also a brief account of the names of some vain persons\r\nthat intend to be there,” whose company the new ladies are desired to\r\nforbear. It begins:\r\n\r\n“Lady, I am informed fine Mrs. Dust, Madam Spot, and my Lady Paint are\r\nto meet in Hide-Park this afternoon; much of pride will be there,” and\r\nso on to considerable length, with many a befitting admonition.\r\n\r\nIn Hyde Park on one occasion Cromwell very nearly lost his life. Some\r\nbeautiful Friesland horses had been presented to him by the Duke of\r\nHolstein, and when taking the air in the Park, accompanied merely by\r\nhis Secretary and a small guard of janissaries, he became so infuriated\r\nat the slowness of their pace that he exchanged places with the\r\ncoachman, and with great impatience thrashed the animals soundly to\r\nmake them quicken their speed. High-spirited, and not understanding\r\nsuch rough usage, they promptly bolted, and, tearing along at a frantic\r\npace, threw the Protector off the box. As he fell his pistol went off\r\nin his pocket, and his legs became so entangled in the harness that\r\nthe poor man was dangling from the pole for some seconds. However, he\r\nreceived no substantial injury beyond a good shaking and some bruises.\r\n\r\nA plot against his life was laid by two men named Syndercombe and\r\nCecill, who meant to assassinate him as he took daily exercise in Hyde\r\nPark, as ordered by his physicians. The assassins’ fellow-conspirators\r\nfiled off the hinges of the Park gate in order to facilitate their\r\nescape, but their scheme was unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nAnother experience the Protector had at the entrance to Hyde Park, was\r\nan interview with George Fox, the founder of that great and good body\r\nof “Friends” or Quakers. This enthusiast approached Cromwell’s coach\r\nin spite of the protestations of his attendants, and, riding by the\r\nvehicle, Fox rebuked its occupant for the harsh measures he was dealing\r\nout to his political enemies. Fox rode thus to “James Park Gate,”\r\nwhere, on his taking leave, Cromwell, who had already told his people\r\nnot to interfere with the Quaker, bade his reprover come and see him\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nIt was a bold act to reprove Cromwell.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the perils with which he met there, Cromwell was very\r\nfond of Hyde Park. It must still have been delightfully wild, though\r\nless picturesque than before the timber was cut down and the game\r\ndriven away. A few building sites were marked out and dwelling-houses\r\nplanned. Either no houses were built, or they have since been removed\r\nand all traces obliterated, for no private residences exist in Hyde\r\nPark, although there are a few fine ones in Regent’s Park, still\r\nstanding in their own grounds, notably those belonging to the Marquis\r\nof Bute and Lord Aldenham. As late as 1658, land in the park was still\r\nbeing offered for sale. There is an interesting advertisement in the\r\n_Mercurius Politicus_ of 13-20th May in that year:\r\n\r\n“This is to give notice That if any persons have a minde to imploy\r\ntheir money in Building, they may have Four Acres of Ground, and a\r\nconvenient place to build on in Hide Park.”\r\n\r\nSpring Gardens existed on the site and surroundings known by that name\r\nto-day. It was probably so called in the reign of James I. from a\r\nspring of water, which was arranged in order that when a certain spot\r\nwas trodden upon, a jet was thrown up all over the unlucky person. It\r\ncontained a pheasantry, shooting butts, a bowling green, and a bathing\r\npool, and soon became a popular place of resort, where refreshments\r\nwere obtainable by the fashionables of the day.\r\n\r\nThis custom of taking refreshments in Spring Gardens has continued to\r\nour own time. It will be remembered that a couple of old dames kept\r\ncows behind Carlton House Terrace until 1904, charging one penny for\r\na cup of warm milk direct from their kine. When the new Processional\r\nDrive was being planned in memory of Queen Victoria, it was found that\r\ntheir little booth and tethered cattle were in the way, and they were\r\ntold to move.\r\n\r\nThis the old dames refused to do, and after much talk, much\r\ncorrespondence, and much fuss, King Edward VII., with his customary\r\nkindliness, had a little kiosk built for them. So they are the sole\r\nremaining trace of the refreshment booths in Spring Gardens, and\r\nproudly print on their little paper bags that they were “Established\r\n1623.”\r\n\r\nA movement is on foot to reinstate refreshment booths in Hyde Park,\r\nas we saw in the last chapter, by placing one on the site of the old\r\nhorse-racing Ring; but it is to be hoped many more will be opened on\r\nthe lines of the charming little tea kiosks that have been instituted\r\nin Kensington Gardens,—a long-delayed reform that is much needed.\r\n\r\nTea and light refreshments in our parks would be a great boon to many.\r\nBreakfast, luncheon, or tea in the open is very enjoyable, and even in\r\nour queer climate (which is really the best in the world, God bless\r\nit) could be enjoyed for several months every year, especially if wide\r\nbalconies were added to the little restaurants for shelter.\r\n\r\nIn 1777 the Marybone Tea Gardens were celebrated for just this kind of\r\nthing. They were on the site of Devonshire Street, Devonshire Place,\r\nand Beaumont Street. They were open for public breakfasts and evening\r\nconcerts to high-class, select company, fireworks being occasionally\r\nintroduced in the evenings. Mighty fashionable they were. Who knows but\r\nwe may soon have the same again at Hyde Park or Regent’s Park, instead\r\nof having to go to Ranelagh, or Hurlingham, some miles from town, and\r\nwhere it is necessary either to be, or to accompany, a member?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nFASHION AND FRIVOLITY\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat changes came over Hyde Park with the arrival of Charles II. in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nAll the purchases of Royal Lands were annulled as unlawful and the\r\nproperty was seized for the Crown. As the new King, once he had made\r\nhis position secure, showed no desire to prevent his subjects sharing\r\nwith himself the enjoyment of the parks, the step was most popular.\r\nAnthony Deane’s “porters with long staves”—presumably to trounce\r\nintruders who did not pay for entrance—were swept away, and again the\r\npublic were free to pass in at their own will.\r\n\r\nOn the very spot where the Parliamentary troops had been massed, and\r\nCromwell had harangued them, enormous crowds assembled to shout a\r\nwelcome to the returned monarch.\r\n\r\nThat was a great day.\r\n\r\nIn order that the reception should be a thoroughly imposing one, all\r\nthe representatives of the City attended. Troops were poured into\r\nthe Park, and there was an Order by the new Council of State to the\r\nmilitia of London[1] “to Rendezvous their Regiments of Trained Bands\r\nand Auxiliaries at Hide Park. Major Cox, Quarter Master General of\r\nthe City, hath since by their order been to view the Ground; and\r\nhath allotted a place to be erected for the reception of the Lord\r\nMayor, the Court of Aldermen, and the Commissioners for the Militia.\r\nThe Lord Mayor intends to appear there with his Collar of Esses, and\r\nall the Aldermen in Scarlet Robes, attended with the Mace and Cap of\r\nMaintenance as usual at great Ceremonies.”\r\n\r\nSo, amid tumultuous rejoicings, and surrounded by all the glamour and\r\npageantry of the restored Court, King Charles II. came back to England\r\nfrom his exile on the Continent. The breach from the sterner Puritan\r\nideals was complete. The coarse spirit of the age, so long suppressed,\r\nbroke out afresh in utter abandonment of all restraint, and with\r\nCharles II. there came a period of open licentiousness which happily\r\nis unexampled in our history—though, truth to tell, the scandals to\r\nwhich the Merry Monarch and his voluptuous courtiers gave rise in such\r\nprofusion form piquant reading for people of later days.\r\n\r\nCharles had no idea of restoring the Park to its original condition as\r\na game preserve. Such liberties as his father had granted to the public\r\nhe freely extended. The public took full advantage of them. The diaries\r\nof the day are packed with references to Hyde and St. James’s Parks,\r\nwhich at a bound again became the centre of all the gay and fashionable\r\nlife of the town. To do him justice, Charles made no pretentions\r\ntowards a love of sport. A cock-fight amused him, but rather he\r\npreferred the excitement of his flirtations, his amours, the races in\r\nthe Ring, his birds, his spaniels, and his passion for gambling.\r\n\r\nA few scattered portions of the pasture lands, however, seem to have\r\nbeen let out as farms. The Park was placed in the general care of the\r\nDuke of Gloucester, to whom a warrant was made “of the Custody of\r\nHyde Park with all Houses, etc. belonging thereto; fee, 8d. per day.”\r\nMr. James Hamilton—after whom Hamilton Place was named—was appointed\r\nRanger. Some one with a money-making turn of mind evidently thought it\r\nwould be a good plan to utilise land for growing fruit, and Hamilton\r\nbegan negotiations for enclosing a portion of the grounds as an\r\norchard. Later in the reign some of the deer were restored to the Park,\r\nand an ornamental path and wall were made round it. A more substantial\r\nbrick wall, 6½ feet high inside and 8 feet outside, was built by George\r\nI. to enclose the Park, and remained standing until 1828, when it was\r\nreplaced by open iron railings.\r\n\r\nHamilton fared by no means badly with his Rangership, for on his\r\nretirement he received a pension of £850 a year, and a pension of £500\r\nwas granted to his widow to commence on his death, to be paid out of\r\nthe clergy tenths or tithes in certain dioceses.\r\n\r\nThe fashion of the period was to resort to Hyde Park for a drive, but\r\nSt. James’s Park, Spring Gardens, the Mulberry Gardens (on the present\r\nsite of Buckingham Palace, which had been planted by James I. to\r\nencourage the silk industry) were the favourite places of recreation.\r\nSports and games abounded in St. James’s, which, being close to\r\nWhitehall, was always held in the highest favour by the Merry Monarch,\r\nwho loitered there mornings and afternoons, surrounded by his courtiers\r\nand mistresses. He extended its attractions, planting trees, laying out\r\nwalks, and improving the canal, which, however, still remained straight\r\nand uninteresting. Cages with numerous species of birds were placed in\r\nthe trees of Bird Cage Walk, then known as the Aviary. The King loved\r\nto feed and fondle these pets of his, coming with his pockets full of\r\ntheir favourite foods, his dogs following him. So numerous were the pet\r\nbirds and so carefully tended by their Royal Master, that hemp-seed\r\nremained for a long time one of the items of expense in the bills of\r\nthe Royal Mews.\r\n\r\nThe Mall was kept in splendid condition for the old game of _Paile\r\nMaille_, from which some say we derive the word Pall Mall, now the name\r\nof a neighbouring street, while the Royal Cockpit was again in constant\r\nuse by the King and his courtiers. Dryden is said to have wandered in\r\nthe Mulberry Gardens and eaten the fruit while he composed his verses.\r\n\r\n“Hyde Park” (writes Count de Grammont) “as every one knows, is to\r\nLondon what the Cours is to Paris. Nothing was then so much in Fashion\r\nduring the fair Season as the taking the Air at the Ring, which was the\r\nordinary Rendezvous of Magnificence and Beauty. Whoever had bright Eyes\r\nor a fine Equipage never failed to repair thither, and the King was\r\nextremely delighted with the place.”\r\n\r\nThose were the days of wigs and velvets and extravagance in men’s\r\ndress. They wore silk stockings with shoes, or long boots curling\r\nover at the top, embroidered coats, lace, frills, and plumed hats.\r\nPicturesque and beautiful was their attire. The women’s full skirts\r\nwere made of handsome stuffs, and rivalry of splendour was still\r\nrampant. Verily an age of extravagance. The Ring long remained the\r\nchief social centre in the Park. It seems to have been but poorly laid\r\nout, judging by Wilson’s description, 1679, in his _Memoirs_, published\r\nmany years afterwards:\r\n\r\n“Here the people of fashion take the diversion of the Ring. In a pretty\r\nhigh place, which lies very open; they have surrounded a circumference\r\nof two or three hundred paces diameter with a sorry kind of balustrade,\r\nor rather with postes placed upon stakes but three feet from the\r\nground; and the coaches drive round this. When they have turned for\r\nsome time round one way, they face about and turn tother: so rowls the\r\nworld!”\r\n\r\nAmong the customs of the Stuart and early Hanoverian periods was\r\nthat of issuing—in the absence of the voluminous Press of our\r\ntime—“broadsides” and “satyrs” on leaflets, which were distributed\r\nthrough London, and “took off” the leading people and topics of the\r\nday. The Ring afforded a rich field for these so long as it lived, and\r\nheld as important a place in that class of literature as Hyde Park does\r\nin our modern Society papers.\r\n\r\nSo much is said about the Park by the diarists Pepys and Evelyn, that\r\nthe social life of the place may almost be pictured from their pages\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nPepys is always a delight. One may still see his famous MS. “Diary”\r\nin the Library of Magdalene College, Cambridge. It is in four or five\r\nvolumes of shorthand, neatly written, with tidy margins, and the names\r\nof persons and places in well-formed letters in longhand. Presumably\r\nhe did not intend it for publication, or he would not have written it\r\nin shorthand, and that of an extraordinarily complicated nature. Years\r\nelapsed before it was deciphered, and still more years passed before it\r\nbecame a classic in literature.\r\n\r\nSamuel Pepys was the son of a tailor; but he became Secretary of the\r\nAdmiralty, an appointment he filled most ably for many years. He was\r\nalso President of the Royal Society. His mind was both as refined and\r\nas coarse as the age in which he lived. He jotted down the minutest\r\ndetails of the day. At his death he left his library to his old\r\nCollege, and, strange to relate, the double rows in the shelves were\r\narranged by him according to size, and in no way according to subject,\r\nso that a tiny note-book of James I. in this remarkable collection\r\ncomes number one.\r\n\r\nJohn Evelyn, the contemporary of Pepys, has also left entries of his\r\ndaily round for a period of about sixty years, made complete by a\r\nslight sketch of his life up to the time his _Diary_ commences. He came\r\nfrom a good Surrey stock, Royalist to their heart’s core; but owing\r\nto the Great Rebellion he lived abroad for some years, returning to\r\nEngland in 1652, when he diligently wrote various books. Evelyn was\r\nlater made a Fellow of the Royal Society, then newly founded, and now\r\nthe most coveted position a man of science and learning can attain.\r\nFrom that time his work embraced various scientific subjects. Amongst\r\nthem he laid before the Society observations on the growth of trees,\r\nwhich he afterwards fully discussed in _Sylva_. The early _Reports of\r\nthe Royal Society_ contain this quaint announcement: “Mr. Evelyn gave\r\nsome account of the experiment recommended to him, of putting some\r\nflesh and blood in a vessel covered with flannel, in order to see what\r\ninsects it would breed, and he observed that it bred nothing. He was\r\nrequested by the Society to continue the Experiment.”\r\n\r\nBacteriologists who find such wondrous products and germs in blood must\r\nsmile over his barren result.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the gaieties of the Park were revived we find Pepys to the\r\nfore, anxious to miss nothing. In the autumn of the Restoration year he\r\nwrites:\r\n\r\n“With Mr. Moore and Creed to Hide Park by coach, and saw a fine\r\nfoot-race three times round the Park between an Irishman and Crow, that\r\nwas once my Lord Claypole’s footman. Crow beat the other by above two\r\nmiles.”\r\n\r\nIn the following year the Diarists both refer to the May-Day\r\ndemonstrations as unsurpassed. Pepys was obliged to be out of town on\r\nbusiness, and again expresses his regret at not being “among the great\r\ngallants and ladies, which will be very fine”; while one detects in\r\nEvelyn’s note the Royalist’s satisfaction over the Restoration: “I went\r\nto Hide Park” (he says) “to take the air, where was His Majesty and an\r\ninnumerable appearance of gallants and rich coaches, being now a time\r\nof universal festivity.”\r\n\r\nPepys was more fortunate in reaching the Park on May Day, 1663, but he\r\nwas not pleased:\r\n\r\n“Turned and rode through the fields and then to Holborn ... towards\r\nHide Park, whither all the world, I think, are going.... I saw nothing\r\ngood, neither the King nor my Lady Castlemaine nor my great ladies\r\nor beauties being here, there being more pleasure a great deal at an\r\nordinary day; or else those few good faces that there were were choked\r\nup with the many bad ones, there being people of all sorts in coaches\r\nthere, to some thousands I think. Going thither in the highway, just by\r\nthe Park gate, I met a boy in a sculler boat, carried by a dozen people\r\nat least, rowing as hard as he could drive, it seems upon some wager.\r\nBy and by, about seven or eight o’clock homeward ... coaches going in\r\ngreat crowds to the further end of the town almost.”\r\n\r\nHearts seemed light and Society gay, for the Diarist makes mention\r\nof several visits to the Park during that year; of the King and his\r\nmistress Lady Castlemaine, who finally died in poverty, greeting one\r\nanother from their respective coaches “at every tour”; of a drive with\r\nMrs. Pepys, wherein there was little pleasure on account of the dust,\r\nand one of the horses falling down and getting his leg over the pole;\r\nand another occasion when the worthy couple enjoyed the sight of a\r\n“store of coaches and good faces.” Only when Charles II. pulled up\r\nto speak to his friends—chiefly ladies—was the continuous string of\r\ncarriages allowed to stop.\r\n\r\nBut the day of that season seems to have been a great Review held in\r\nHyde Park on 4th July. Both Diarists write of this event, and as the\r\nentries are truly characteristic of the different style of the two\r\njournals, I give them both. First Evelyn:\r\n\r\n“I saw his Majesty’s Guards, being of horse and foot 4000, led by the\r\nGeneral, the Duke of Albemarle [General Monk, who had done so much to\r\nbring about the Restoration], in extraordinary equipage and gallantry,\r\nconsisting of gentlemen of quality and veteran soldiers, excellently\r\nclad, mounted and ordered, drawn up in battalia before their Majesties\r\nin Hyde Park, where the old Earl of Cleveland trailed a pike, and led\r\nthe right-hand file in a foot-company, commanded by Lord Wentworth,\r\nhis son: as worthy spectacle and example, being both of them old and\r\nvaliant soldiers. This was to show the French Ambassador, Monsieur\r\nComminges; there being a great assembly of coaches etc. in the Park.”\r\n\r\nIt is left to Pepys to pourtray the lighter side:\r\n\r\n“Thence with Creed to hire a coach to carry us to Hide Park, to-day\r\nthere being a general muster of the King’s Guards, horse and foot; but\r\nthe demand so high, that I, spying Mr. Cutler the marchant, did take\r\nnotice of him, and he going into his coach, and telling me that he was\r\ngoing to shew a couple of Swedish strangers the muster, I asked and\r\nwent along with him; where a goodly sight to see so many fine horses\r\nand officers, and the King, Duke, and others come by a-horseback, and\r\nthe two Queens in the Queen-Mother’s coach, my Lady Castlemayne not\r\nbeing there, I ’light and walked to the place where the King, Duke,\r\netc., did stand to see the horse and foot march by and discharge their\r\nguns, to show a French Marquisse (for whom the muster was caused) the\r\ngoodness of our firemen; which indeed was very good, though not without\r\na slip now and then; and one broadside so close to our coach we had\r\ngoing out of the Park, even to the nearness to be ready to burn our\r\nhairs.”\r\n\r\nA few days later Pepys describes another visit to Hyde Park:\r\n\r\n“Hearing that the King and Queen are rode abroad with the Ladies of\r\nHonour in the Park, and seeing a great crowd of gallants staying here\r\nto see their return, I also staid walking up and down.... By and by\r\nthe King and Queen, who looked in this dress (a white laced waistcoat\r\nand a crimson short petticoat, and her hair dressed _à la negligence_)\r\n_mighty_ pretty; and the King rode hand in hand with her. Here was also\r\nmy Lady Castlemaine rode among the rest of the ladies, but the King\r\ntook, methought, no notice of her.”\r\n\r\nPepys was a man of many parts, and one of the most human of his kind.\r\nThis wonderful _Diary_ of his contains the moralising of a philosopher,\r\nmixed with descriptions of the skittish flirtations of the man about\r\ntown, the deeper _amours_ of the licentious Court, and the coarsest\r\nscandal and gossip, prices of various articles, political events, the\r\nweather, the servant question, and details of ladies’ gowns. He even\r\nsent a “poor fellow” to sit at the Duke of York’s playhouse to keep a\r\nseat for him, as messenger boys are sent to-day to secure seats in the\r\npit.\r\n\r\nWhen at this time the riding habit for ladies was first displayed in\r\nHyde Park, Pepys writes:\r\n\r\n“I saw them with coats and doublets with deep skirts, just like mine,\r\nand their doublets buttoned up the breast, with perriwigs and hats, so\r\nthat only for a long petticoat dragging under the men’s coats, nobody\r\nwould take them for women in any point whatever.”\r\n\r\nOn another occasion we find him discussing ladies’ dress with Lady\r\nCarteret:\r\n\r\n“She tells me the ladies are to go into a new fashion shortly, and that\r\nis to wear short coats, above their ancles; which she and I do not\r\nlike, but conclude this long trayne to be mighty graceful.”\r\n\r\nIn 1664 he thus speaks of Lady Castlemaine:\r\n\r\n“To Hide Parke, where I have not been since last year; where I saw the\r\nKing with his periwigg, but not altered at all; and my Lady Castlemayne\r\nin a coach by herself, in yellow satin and a pinner on; and many brave\r\npersons. And myself being in a hackney coach and full of people, was\r\nashamed to be seen of the world, many of them knowing me.”\r\n\r\nPoor Pepys, what a love of display and dress.\r\n\r\nGloves seem to have been a valued article of dress at this time. De\r\nGrammont mentions the fact that they were given as presents, and much\r\nstore put upon them: “Martial gloves were then very much the fashion.”\r\nThis rather flavours of reviews, but he does not refer to anything\r\nmilitary, only to a famous firm of glovers in Paris, Martial by name,\r\nwhose gloves—like all things French in those days—were in great\r\nrequest.\r\n\r\nPepys leaves behind him a graphic chronicle of the licentiousness and\r\nprofligacy of the period, which had best be thrust aside, but his\r\ndescription of the Court generally may be quoted here:\r\n\r\n“The Court, as hinted before, was the seat and Fountain of Sports,\r\nPleasures and Enjoyments, and all the polite and magnificent\r\nEntertainments, which are generally inspired by the Inclinations of a\r\ntender, amorous and indulgent Prince. The Beauties studied to charm,\r\nthe men to please; And all, in short, improved their talents the best\r\nthey could. Some distinguished themselves by Dancing, others by Show\r\nand Magnificence, some by their Wit, many by their Amours, but very few\r\nby their Constancy.”\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that Lord Arlington erected a house near the\r\nMulberry Gardens, and during the Plague he brought the first pound of\r\ntea from Holland, which cost him thirty shillings; so that probably the\r\nfirst cup of tea drunk in England was enjoyed where Buckingham Palace\r\nnow stands.\r\n\r\nJames Hamilton, the Ranger of Hyde Park, and John Birch, the Auditor\r\nof Excise, were, after much discussion, successful in the negotiations\r\nfor their orchard, and in 1664 they received a grant “of 55 acres\r\nof land on the borders of the said park, to be planted with trees\r\nfor eating-apples or cider, reserving a way through Westminster to\r\nKensington, on condition of their enclosing and planting the ground\r\nat their own cost, paying a rental of £5, and giving half the apples”\r\n(which were to be redstreaks or pippins) “for the use of the King’s\r\nHousehold.” The State Papers also record that a lease of forty-one\r\nyears of 55 acres in the north-west corner of Hyde Park, for growing\r\napples, was granted on the above conditions.\r\n\r\nBut in the following year the Great Plague, more virulent and more\r\nfatal than ever, broke out and raged in London. Such a visitation, bad\r\nas the plagues had been in mediæval times, had never been known. Panic\r\nensued, and everyone who could do so left London and its suburbs. The\r\nMetropolis became a deserted city.\r\n\r\nHyde Park was made a plague camping-ground. Among those quartered\r\nwithin its boundaries were regiments of soldiers from the Tower and\r\nelsewhere. One of these men, evidently an amusing, observant fellow,\r\nwithout any poetical gifts, bethought himself to write a doggerel\r\naccount of his experiences. It is an excellent picture of the time, and\r\ndepicts the horrors of the Plague even as far afield as Hyde Park was\r\nat that day:\r\n\r\n  HIDE PARK CAMP\r\n\r\n  Limnd out to the Life,\r\n\r\nTruly and Impartially, for the Information and Satisfaction of such\r\nas were not Eye Witnesses, of the Souldiers’ sad sufferings, In that\r\n(never-to-be-forgotten) Year of our Lord God, one thousand six hundred\r\nand sixty-five.\r\n\r\n  Written by a fellow souldier and Sufferer\r\n            in the said Camp.\r\n\r\n  Help now (Minerva), stand a Souldier’s friend,\r\n  Direct my Muse, that I may not offend.\r\n    ’Tis known I write not for to gain applause,\r\n    My Sword and Pen shall maintain Martial Laws.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    In July, Sixteen hundred sixty and five,\r\n    (O happy is the Man that’s now alive)\r\n    When God’s destroying Angel sore did smite us,\r\n    ’Cause he from sin by no means could invite us;\r\n    When lovely London was in mourning clad,\r\n    And not a Countenance appeared but sad;\r\n    When the Contagion all about was spread;\r\n    And people in the streets did fall down dead;\r\n    When Money’d Fugitives away did flee,\r\n    And took their Heels, in hopes to scape scot-free,\r\n    Just then we march’t away, the more’s the pitty,\r\n    And took our farewell of the Doleful City.\r\n    With heavy hearts into Hide Park we came,\r\n    To chuse a Place whereas we might remain.\r\n    Our ground we viewed, then straight to work didfall,\r\n    And build up Houses without any wall.\r\n    We pitch’t our Tents in ridges and in Furrows,\r\n    And there encamp’t, fearing the Almighty’s Arrows.\r\n    But O, Alas! what did this avail;\r\n    Our men (ere long) began to droop and quail.\r\n    Our lodgings cold, and some not us’d thereto,\r\n    Fell sick and dy’d, and made no more adoe.\r\n    At length the Plague amongst us ’gan to spread,\r\n    When ev’ry morning some were found stark dead.\r\n    Down to another Field the sick were t’ane;\r\n    But few went down, that e’er came up again.\r\n    For want of comfort, many I observed,\r\n    Perished and dy’d, which might have been preserved.\r\n    But that which most of all did grieve my soul\r\n    To see poor Christians dragged into a hole.\r\n    Tye match about them, as they had been Logs,\r\n    And Draw them into Holes, far worse than Dogs.\r\n    When each man did expect his turn was next,\r\n    O then our Hearts with sorrow was perplext.\r\n    Our officers amazed stood, for dread,\r\n    To see their men no sooner sick than dead.\r\n    But that which most of all did grieve them, why?\r\n    To help the same, there was no remedy.\r\n    A Pest house was prepared, and means was us’d,\r\n    That none should be excluded, or refused:\r\n    Yet all would not avail, they dy’d apace,\r\n    As one dy’d out, another took his place.\r\n    A sad and dismal time, as ere was known,\r\n    When Corps, in the wide fields, about was thrown.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Methinks I hear some say, Friend, Prithee hark,\r\n    Where got you drink and victuals in the Park?\r\n    I, there’s the Query; we shall soon decide it,\r\n    Why, we had men called Sutlers, provided;\r\n    Subtle they were, before they drove this Trade,\r\n    But by this means they all were subtler made.\r\n    No wind or weather, ere could make them flinch\r\n    Yet they would have the Souldiers at a pinch.\r\n    For my part I know little of their way,\r\n    But what I heard my fellow-Souldiers say:\r\n    One said, Their Meat and Pottage was too fat;\r\n    Yes, quoth another, we got none of that:\r\n    Besides, quoth he, they have a cunning sleight,\r\n    In selling out their meate by pinching weight,\r\n    To make us pay sixpence a pound for Beefe,\r\n    To a poor Souldier, is no little grief.\r\n\r\n    Their Bread is small, their Cheese is markt by th’ Inch,\r\n    And to speak the Truth, they’re all upon the pinch.\r\n    As for their Liquor, drink it but at Leazure,\r\n    And you shall ne’re be drunk with over measure.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    But leave them now because Tattoo has beat\r\n    And fairly to our tents let us retreat,\r\n    Where we keep such a coyl, and such a quarter,\r\n    And all to make the tedious nights seem shorter.\r\n    Then down we lie, until our bones do ake,\r\n    First one side, then the other weary make.\r\n    When frost did pinch us, then we shake and shiver,\r\n    And full as bad we were in stormy weather.\r\n    A boisterous blast, when men with sleep were dead,\r\n    Would bring their houses down upon their head.\r\n    Thus in extremity we often lay,\r\n    Longing to see the dawning of the day,\r\n    Which brought us little comfort, for the Air\r\n    Was very sharp, and very hard our fare.\r\n    Our sufferings were almost beyond belief,\r\n    And yet we found small hopes to have relief.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    We were as glad when we got to a Cup\r\n    Of Nappy ale, to take a pretty sup:\r\n    But durst not go to town, on any cause,\r\n    For fear the Martial catch us in his claws.\r\n    About the park to walk for recreation,\r\n    We might be free, we knew our bounds and station,\r\n    But not a coach was stirring anywhere,\r\n    Unless ’twere such as brought us in our Beer.\r\n    Alass, Hide Park, these are with the sad dayes,\r\n    The Coaches all are turned to Brewers’ Drayes;\r\n    Instead of Girls with Oranges and Lemons,\r\n    The Baker’s boys, they brought in Loaves by dozens;\r\n    And by that means, they kept us pretty sober\r\n    Until the end of wet October.\r\n    They proms’d we should march, and then we leapt,\r\n    But all their promises were broke (or kept).\r\n    They made us all, for want of Winter Quarters,\r\n    Ready to hang ourselves in our own Garters.\r\n\r\n    At last the Dove came with the Olive branch,\r\n    And told for certain, that we should advance\r\n    Out of the Field; O then we leapt for joy,\r\n    And cried with one accord, Vive le Roy.\r\n    What did the Sutlers then? nay, what do ye think?\r\n    For very grief, they gave away their drink.\r\n    But it’s no matter, let them laugh that wins,\r\n    They were no loosers. (God forgive their sins.)\r\n\r\n    Upon Gunpowder Treason Day, (at night)\r\n    We burnt our Bed-straw, to make Bonfire light;\r\n    And went to bed that night so merry-hearted\r\n    For joy, we and our Lodgings should be parted:\r\n    Next morning we were up by break of day,\r\n    To be in readiness to march away.\r\n    We bid adue to Hide Park’s fruitful Soil,\r\n    And left the Countrey to divide the spoyl.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    God bless King Charles, and send him long to Reign,\r\n    And grant we may never know the like again.\r\n\r\n          (LONDON. Printed by P. L. for J. P.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Prostitute Drummed Out of Hyde Park.]\r\n\r\nPeople were at their wits’ end to know what to do at the time of the\r\nPlague, but some laughed at a novel proposal made in London while\r\nthe scourge was raging, that a vessel should be freighted with peeled\r\nonions and sail along the Thames to absorb the infection of the air;\r\nafter which it should proceed to sea and throw them overboard.\r\n\r\nBut an unexpected disinfectant followed in the Great Fire, which\r\nstamped out the contagion so well that never again has London been\r\nvisited by the plague. A half-witted Frenchman swung on the gallows\r\nat Tyburn on his own confession of having started the conflagration,\r\nthough when making his final exit from this world he denied it.\r\n\r\nThis Frenchman was named Robert Hubert. In the opinion of many he was a\r\nmadman, but in spite of this an inscription was placed on the Monument\r\nthat the Great Fire was the result of a Papist conspiracy. This was\r\nremoved by James II., but replaced by William III. and remained until\r\n1830, when it was finally done away with.\r\n\r\nIn the same year as the Fire, and almost before its flames were\r\nquenched, the gay world resumed the daily drive to the Park, and we\r\nagain find Pepys joining a colleague at the Admiralty and adjourning\r\nthither in a coach to secure a quiet _tête-à-tête_ on some State\r\nquestion. We read of him attending a theatre or conducting his\r\nfavourite actress or another of his _amours_, for a drive in the Park,\r\nor refreshment at the Lodge. Syllabub was greatly in fashion at Cake\r\nHouse. It was composed of milk whipped up with wine and sugar, or cream\r\nwhipped with cider.\r\n\r\nPepys took his wife for frequent outings, enjoying the gossip round\r\nthe Ring, dining at the “Pillars of Hercules”—an inn near the site of\r\nthe present Apsley House—or eating a cheese-cake at the Lodge “with\r\na tankard of milk”; experiencing a sense of shame at being seen in a\r\nhackney coach. “To Park in a hackney coach, so would not go into the\r\nTour, but round the Park, and to the House, and there at the door eat\r\nand drank.”\r\n\r\nHis criticism of dress was strong to the last, for one of the first\r\nentries he makes after the return of “London” to Hyde Park was on 21st\r\nApril 1666, and runs:\r\n\r\n“Thence, with my Lord Brouncke [the first President of the Royal\r\nSociety] in his coach to Hide Parke, the first time I have been\r\nthere this year. There the King was; but I was sorry to see my Lady\r\nCastlemaine, for the mourning forceing all the ladies to go in black,\r\nwith their hair plain, and without any spots [patches] I find her to be\r\na much more ordinary woman than ever I durst have thought she was.”\r\n\r\nWhen the effect of the Plague and Fire had worn off, Hyde Park\r\nevidently became gayer and gayer. Our old Diarist, who, like all the\r\ngossips of the seventeenth century, was gifted with great powers of\r\ncuriosity and criticism, gives a full account of May Day, 1667.\r\n\r\nAt this time a most eccentric figure played a conspicuous part in\r\nSociety, in the person of the Duchess of Newcastle. Her attire and\r\nequipage were so peculiar that she never sallied forth without a crowd\r\nof boys and girls following to look at the quaint display. Such a\r\nsight would delight Pepys, who several times mentions, with genuine\r\ndisappointment, the fact of not being able to see her properly on\r\naccount of the crowd of onlookers who formed her escort. She was a\r\ngreat attraction in the Park on this May Day, for we read:\r\n\r\n“Thence Sir W. Pen and I in his coach, Tiburne way, into the Park,\r\nwhere a horrid dust, and number of coaches without pleasure or order.\r\nThat which we, and almost all went for, was to see my Lady Newcastle;\r\nwhich we could not, she being followed and crowded upon by coaches all\r\nthe way she went, that nobody could come near her; only I could see she\r\nwas in a large black coach adorned with silver instead of gold, and so\r\nwhite curtains, and every thing black and white, and herself in her\r\ncap, but other parts I could not make. But that which I did see, and\r\nwonder at with reason, was to find Peggy Penn in a new coach, with only\r\nher husband’s pretty sister with her, both patched and very fine, and\r\nin much the finest coach in the park, and I think that ever I did see\r\none or other, for neatness and richness of gold, and everything that\r\nis noble. My lady Castlemayne, the King, my Lord St. Albans, nor Mr.\r\nSt. Jermyn have so neat a coach that ever I saw. And Lord! to have them\r\nhave this, and nothing else that is correspondent, is to me one of the\r\nmost ridiculous sights that ever I did see, though her present dress\r\nwas well enough, but to live in the condition they do at home, and be\r\nabroad in this coach, astonishes me.”\r\n\r\nReviews were held frequently. In the autumn of 1668, Pepys attended one\r\nof these: “Colonel the Duke of Monmouth in mighty rich clothes, but\r\nthe well-ordering of the men I understand not,” he writes. A “thousand\r\ncoaches” were present, for it was a gay sight. The soldiers on these\r\noccasions made a brave show with their Cavalier hats and bright coats,\r\nwhile even the horses were bedecked with ribbons on their heads, manes,\r\nand tails.\r\n\r\nThe next year saw the fulfilment of a long-deferred hope in Pepys’\r\nfashionable life, for he then started his own coach. His words are too\r\nquaint to omit:\r\n\r\n“Thence to Hyde Park, the first time we were there this year, or ever\r\nin our own coach, where with mighty pride rode up and down, and many\r\ncoaches there; and I thought our horses and coach as pretty as any\r\nthere, and observed so to be by others. Here staid till night.”\r\n\r\nThe new coach was put to frequent use. A fortnight later he writes:\r\n\r\n“Thence to the Park, my wife and I: and here did Sir W. Coventry first\r\nsee me and my wife in a coach of our own: and so did also this night\r\nthe Duke of York, who did eye my wife mightily. But I begin to doubt\r\nthat my being so much seen in my own coach at this time may be observed\r\nto my prejudice: but I must venture now.”\r\n\r\nThis new purchase added much to Mr. and Mrs. Pepys’ enjoyment of the\r\nMay-Day show, although their tempers were none of the best on that\r\noccasion, seemingly:\r\n\r\n“At noon home to dinner, and there find my wife extraordinary fine,\r\nwith her flowered tably gown that she made two years ago, now laced\r\nexceeding pretty; and indeed was fine all over; and mighty earnest to\r\ngo though the day was very lowering; and she would have me put on my\r\nfine suit, which I did. And so anon we went alone through the town with\r\nour new liveries of serge, and the horses’ manes and tails tied with\r\nred ribbons, and the standards there gilt with varnish, and all clean,\r\nand green reines, that people did mightily look upon us; and the truth\r\nis, I did not see any coach more pretty though more gay, than ours,\r\nall the day. But we set out, out of humour—I because Betty, whom I\r\nexpected, was not to come to go with us; and my wife that I would sit\r\non the same seat with her, which she likes not, being so fine: and she\r\nthen expected to meet Sheres, which we did in Pell Mell, and against my\r\nwill, I was forced to take him into the coach, but was sullen all day\r\nalmost, and little complaisant; the day also being unpleasing, though\r\nthe Park full of coaches, but dusty and windy and cold, and now and\r\nthen a little dribbling rain; and what made it worst there were so many\r\nhackney coaches as spoiled the sight of the Gentlemen’s; and so we had\r\nlittle pleasure. But here was W. Batelier and his sister in a borrowed\r\ncoach by themselves, and I took them and we to the Lodge; and at the\r\ndoor did give them a syllabub and other things cost me 12s. and pretty\r\nmerry: and so back to the coaches and there till evening.”\r\n\r\nIt was at a Review a few days after that Pepys “saw more, walking out\r\nof my coach as other gentlemen did, of a soldier’s trade than ever\r\nI did in my life; the men being mighty fine, and their commanders,\r\nparticularly the Duke of Monmouth, but methought the trade but very\r\neasy as to the mustering of their men, but indifferently ready to\r\nperform what was commanded, in the handling of arms.” This entry is\r\nfollowed up by a bit of gossip such as Pepys dearly loved to retail:\r\n\r\n“Here the news first talked of Harry Killigrew’s being wounded in nine\r\nplaces last night by footmen in the highway, going from the Park in a\r\nhackney coach towards Hammersmith to his house at Turnham Greene; they\r\nbeing supposed to be my Lady Shrewsbury’s men, she being by, in her\r\ncoach with six horses, upon an old grudge.”\r\n\r\nThe above quotations are among the closing entries of the old writer.\r\nThat month of May often brought him to Hyde Park—“in our own coach”\r\nas he proudly indites. He drove there on Whit-Sunday, and twice took\r\nhis wife for refreshment to “The World’s End,” which he describes as a\r\ndrinking-house by the Park, at Knightsbridge; and both he and Evelyn\r\nmention the wonderful display of fireworks on the King’s birthday (29th\r\nMay 1669).\r\n\r\nRecords and letters preserved by many of the noble families contain\r\nnumerous references to the gaieties of Hyde Park under the Restoration.\r\n\r\nIn the Harley Papers at Welbeck Abbey, and the Rutland Manuscripts at\r\nBelvoir Castle, letters exist written by Edward Harley to his father,\r\nSir Edward Harley, and from Lady Mary Bertie to her niece, describing\r\nin detail the review that was held in “Hide Parke” in honour of the\r\nvisit of the Prince of Orange (afterwards William III.), then a youth\r\nof nineteen. Mr. Harley says: “Yesterday there was a review in Hyde\r\nPark of all the Guards, horse, foot, cannon, and pioneers, to entertain\r\nthe Prince of Orange.”\r\n\r\nLady Rachel Russell writes to Lady Granby at Belvoir Castle:\r\n\r\n“Lady Salisbury was at Hyde Park a Sunday night, mighty Frenchified in\r\nher dresse, as your brother says.... Mr. Beaumont was upon the road and\r\nmet two coaches and six horses, and the lady lifted up a curtain, and\r\nin French, spoke to aske how far ’twas to Hatfield.”\r\n\r\nThis was another evidence of the love of everything French under the\r\nrégime of Charles II.\r\n\r\nWith another letter from the Rutland Papers, delightful and only\r\na trifle scandalous, this chapter may be fitly closed. The little\r\nincident, told in such a matter-of-fact way, of her Grace of Sussex\r\nand Madame Mazarin going down to St. James’s Park with drawn swords\r\nunder their night-gowns, and making “several fine passes” before an\r\napplauding circle of men, tells more of those times than pages of\r\nmoralising. It is from Lady Chaworth to Lord Ross:\r\n\r\n  DEC. 25, 1676.\r\n\r\n  “... I shall send your Lordship the peck of chesnuts, and 5 lb. of\r\n  vermicelli by the Munday carrier, and hope you will find them all\r\n  good, 3 lb. of the vermicelli being the same, but made up in new\r\n  shapes, which Signore Brunetti sends me word the King had 300 lb. of\r\n  last weeke.... Lady Sussex is not yet gone, but my Lord is better\r\n  and holds his resolution of goeing as soone as the weather breakes up\r\n  to make good travailing. She and Madame Mazarin have privately learnt\r\n  to fence, and went downe into St. James’s Parke the other day with\r\n  drawne swords under theire night gownes, which they drew out and made\r\n  severall fine passes with, to the admiration of severall men that was\r\n  lookers on in the Parke.... The Dutchesse [of York, sister-in-law to\r\n  Charles II.] is much delighted with making and throwing of snowballs,\r\n  and pelted the Duke soundly with one the other day, and ran away\r\n  quick into her closet and he after her, but she durst not open the\r\n  doore. She hath also great pleasure in one of those sledges they call\r\n  _Trainias_, and is pulled up and downe the ponds in them every day,\r\n  as also the King, which are counted dangerous things, and none can\r\n  drive the horse which draws them about but the Duke of Monmouth, Mr.\r\n  Griffin, and Mr. Godolphin, and a fourth whose name I have forgot!”\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[1] _Mercurius Publius_, 19-26th April 1660.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nMASKS AND PATCHES\r\n\r\n\r\nA Well-known story relates that one day Charles II. was returning from\r\nHyde Park, where he was just as fond of walking as James Duke of York\r\nwas of riding. He was attended by two courtiers only, and was crossing\r\nat Hyde Park Corner when he met James coming home from the hunt on\r\nHounslow Heath. The Duke of York was driving in great style in his\r\ncoach, with an escort of Royal Horse Guards. He stopped, stepped from\r\nhis carriage to greet the King, and remonstrated with him for putting\r\nhimself in danger by walking in the public highway attended by only two\r\ngentlemen.\r\n\r\n“No kind of danger,” said Charles, “for I am sure that no man in\r\nEngland will take away my life to make you King!”\r\n\r\nAnd King Charles, who knew men and women well, and concealed many a\r\ntelling truth under his buoyant humour, was quite right. The three\r\nyears of James II.’s misrule are doubtless full of interest to the\r\nhistorian, but they give little material for this volume, and may be\r\npassed over with a bare mention.\r\n\r\nSociety, however, pursued its way, and the daily drive and lounge\r\nsurvived during all the religious and political turmoil. Hyde Park\r\nremained the great _rendezvous_, though James was rarely seen there,\r\nand under the trees were discussed, as of old, the affairs of the\r\nCourt, the plots of the Roman Catholics, precedence of great ladies,\r\nrivalries and jealousie, dress and equipage. A new excitement was added\r\nto the fashionable walk by a custom which began among the beaux and\r\n_grandes dames_ of wearing masks in the Park, and by their means many\r\nintrigues were set afoot. Philip 2nd Earl of Chesterfield has left in\r\nhis _Letters_ a short correspondence with a masked lady with whom he\r\nhad walked in the Park four times. She remained unknown. It was a point\r\nof honour not to attempt to identify a masked person unless the name\r\nwas guessed outright.\r\n\r\nWhat a curious thing it must have been to see men and women at all\r\nhours of the day walking or riding masked. They even went to theatres\r\nso disguised. These half-masks were called “visors,” and by some people\r\n“hide-blushes.”\r\n\r\nOthers found methods of gallantry more daring than this. From Nell\r\nGwynne’s time—I do not know whether the Royal favourite’s previous and\r\nmore honourable calling had anything to do with it—it had become the\r\ncustom to buy oranges and cakes from orange-girls in Hyde Park. This\r\ncustom lasted for many years. Constant mention is made of these girls\r\nin the gossip of the day, and they are reported to have carried more\r\nromantic wares than the yellow fruit, for they were often the chosen\r\nbearers of _billets doux_ from gallants to their ladies, and _vice\r\nversâ_.\r\n\r\nFrom the half concealment of a mask it was but a step for a great lady\r\nof a sportive turn to disguise herself as an orange girl and bear the\r\nburden of the basket, the true owner of which, washed, painted and\r\npowdered, and dressed out of recognition, mixed among the gay crowd\r\nand added to their bewilderment. The great figure of Sarah Duchess of\r\nMarlborough appears as one of those who found amusement in this very\r\nundignified change of station.\r\n\r\nKing James retired, unlamented, into exile, and his daughter Mary and\r\nWilliam of Orange came over to take the English throne. Though great\r\nas a Queen, Mary seems to have been a somewhat unfilial daughter, if\r\nwe accept Evelyn’s testimony when saying that she came into Whitehall\r\n“laughing and jolly as to a wedding, seeming quite transported,” or\r\nthat other account of her routing about the Queen’s apartments, in and\r\nout of every room, in her night attire, before the household were astir\r\nin the morning.\r\n\r\nThe fashionable crowd about the Parks seemed less at ease, and no\r\ndoubt there were numerous absentees. Men pursuing their daily duties,\r\nthe merchant in the City, or the dandy of the day sauntering in the\r\nmorning, on whom the slightest suspicion of Jacobitism rested, would\r\nbe accosted by a gruff individual, shown a Privy Council warrant, and\r\ndragged off, ruffle, cravat, embroideries, and wig notwithstanding. An\r\nignominious retreat from a gay scene or a busy world.\r\n\r\nWriting in 1690 to her husband, William III., who was in Holland, Queen\r\nMary says: “I was only last night in Hyde Park, for the first time\r\nsince you went: it swarmed with those that are now ordered to be clapt\r\nup.”\r\n\r\nMary, unfortunately, was not able to convey much of her “jolliness”\r\nto the Park, where the lighter side of London life loved to assemble.\r\nKing William suffered from asthma, and a damp riverside Palace at\r\nWestminster did not suit him. He was recommended to migrate to\r\nKensington, near the Gravel Pits. This was far remote from the town;\r\nbut possibly the dryness of the gravel soil settled the choice.\r\n\r\nTen years after his reign began, old Whitehall Palace was consumed in\r\nflames, and the severance was then complete. The King had bought a\r\nhouse and grounds from the Earl of Nottingham, and there raised the\r\npresent building of Kensington Palace, wherein Queen Victoria was born.\r\n\r\nThough still so near, Hyde Park saw little of them, for William was\r\noccupied in State affairs, and Queen Mary preferred the quietness of\r\ntheir private gardens. Thus whatever little tone and vigour remained in\r\nSociety, soon disappeared, and a greater laxity made itself apparent.\r\nThe Park, as it ceased to be a Royal preserve and properly cared\r\nfor, became infested with undesirable characters, and Knightsbridge,\r\nwhich, as already mentioned, had always been looked on as a locality\r\nfrequented by robbers, presented many hiding-places for footpads of the\r\nmost desperate description. Hyde Park sank into a period of degradation\r\nunexampled either before or since.\r\n\r\nStill it was an age of romance. It is rather amusing to read of the tax\r\non bachelors. It must be remembered that at the beginning of the reign\r\nof William and Mary the population of England was only five and a half\r\nmillions, and the revenue amounted to £1,400,000.\r\n\r\nNo wonder that in 1695 an Act was passed obliging all bachelors and\r\nwidowers above twenty-five years old to pay a tax of one shilling\r\nyearly; a bachelor or widower duke, £12, 10s.; a marquis, £10 a year.\r\n\r\nWhile attempting to increase the revenues, the only attempt made at\r\nmunicipal improvement during the reign seems to have been the lighting\r\nof the principal thoroughfares from St. James’s. Apparently William had\r\nlittle use for the Park but to pass through it and the Green Park on\r\nhis way from Kensington to the town, and this he often had to do after\r\nsunset. The road was rough and dark; in fact, was altogether unsafe\r\nafter nightfall. The King decided that, whatever the cost, it must be\r\nlighted. Accordingly he had about three hundred lamps placed along the\r\nway. But this was too great an expense in those days to be kept up\r\nexcept in the winter, and the spluttering oil-wick lamps only dimly\r\nlighted it for a few months of the year.\r\n\r\nThis was rather a difference from our present-day lighting\r\narrangements, which many people still consider totally insufficient.\r\nVice flies before illumination. In this year of grace the Park is\r\nlighted with electric arc lamps as well as incandescent gas. The policy\r\nis to light up main roads and paths, but not the whole surface of the\r\nPark. Certain wide spaces, like the “Lecture Ground” near the Marble\r\nArch, the road from the Marble Arch to Hyde Park Corner, and the Band\r\nStand enclosure, are lighted by electricity.\r\n\r\nWhen William and Mary increased the popularity of Kensington by going\r\nto live at the new Palace, they also improved the prospects of the\r\never enterprising light-handed fraternity. Social gatherings of all\r\nsorts took place, gambling was indulged in for high stakes, and ladies\r\nattending Court functions at St. James’s and private entertainments at\r\nKensington had to pass along this dreary road, laden with jewels or the\r\nproceeds of the basset tables. The thieves were so active and daring\r\nthat at last a guard-house had to be erected within the park, and the\r\nplace patrolled, while on occasions of any Court functions the Park\r\nguard was doubled.\r\n\r\nThe _London Post_ of 7th December 1699 records that\r\n\r\n“On Monday night the Patroul of the Guards was doubled between\r\nKensington and the City, and marched continually to and fro till day to\r\nprevent any Robberies being committed upon those that returned from the\r\nBasset-tables held there that Evening.”\r\n\r\nIn ill-repute though it had become, “persons of quality” still enjoyed\r\ntheir afternoon drive in Hyde Park. Its worst side was reserved for\r\nthe night. The gilded coaches, the painted women, and swaggering men,\r\nwith their wigs, their long waistcoats and their swords, moving about\r\namong the trees, gave an appearance of festivity, even if the times\r\nwere remarkably dull. Tom Brown’s _Amusements Serious and Comical_,\r\npublished in 1700, gives a picture of Hyde Park manners near the close\r\nof William III.’s reign which is certainly not edifying. The author is\r\nsupposed to be showing “an Indian” over London:\r\n\r\n“From Spring Garden we set our Faces towards Hide Park, where Horses\r\nhave their Diversions as well as Men, and Neigh and Court their\r\nMistresses almost in as intelligible a Dialect. Here People Coach it\r\nto take the Air, amidst a Cloud of Dust, able to choak a Foot Soldier,\r\nand hinder’d us from seeing those that come hither on purpose to show\r\nthemselves. However, we made hard shift to get now and then a glance at\r\nsome of them.\r\n\r\n“Here we saw much to do about nothing: a World of Brave Men, Gilt\r\nCoaches, and Rich Liveries. Within some of them were Upstart Courtiers,\r\nblown up as big as Pride and Vanity could swell them to; as if a Stake\r\nhad been driven through them. It would hurt their Eyes to exchange a\r\nGlance upon anything that’s Vulgar, and that’s the Reason they are so\r\nsparing of their Looks, that they will neither Bow nor move their Hats\r\nto anything under a Duke or a Duchess, and yet if you examine some of\r\ntheir Original; a Covetous, Soul-less Miser, or a great Oppressor, laid\r\nthe Foundation of their Families, and in their Retinue there are more\r\nCreditors than Servants.\r\n\r\n“‘See,’ says my Indian, ‘what a Bevy of Gallant Ladies are in yonder\r\nCoaches; some are Singing, others Laughing, others Tickling one\r\nanother, and all of them Toying and devouring Cheese-cakes, March Pane,\r\nand China Oranges. See that Lady,’ says he; ‘was ever anything so black\r\nas her Eye and so clear as her Forehead? one would swear her face had\r\ntaken its Tincture from all the Beauties in Nature.’ ‘And yet perhaps,’\r\nanswered I to my Fellow-Traveller, ‘all this is but Imposture; she\r\nmight, for ought we know, got to Bed last night as ugly as a Hagg,\r\ntho’ she now appears like an Angel; and if you did but see this Puppet\r\ntaken to pieces, her whole is but Paint and Plaster ... these are\r\nBirds to amuse one, that change their Feathers two or three times a\r\nDay.... In a word, the generality of Women are Peacocks when they walk:\r\nWater-wagtails when they are within doors, and Turtles when they meet\r\nFace to Faces.’”\r\n\r\nEven in broad daylight the fashionable throngs were liable to be\r\nsubjected to annoyance. In the _Post Boy_ of 7th June 1695 it says:\r\n\r\n“Some days since several Persons of Quality having been affronted at\r\nthe Ring in Hide Park, by some other Persons that rode in Hackney\r\nCoaches with Masks, and Complaint thereof being made to the Lords\r\nJustices, an order is made that no Hackney Coaches be permitted to go\r\ninto the said Park, and that none presume to appear there in masks.”\r\n\r\nThe law against hackney coaches survives, and they are still only\r\nallowed to cross between the Park and Kensington Gardens. Masked\r\nladies and gallants have ceased to exist, although a music-hall\r\nperformer, apparently wishing to attract attention and advertisement,\r\ndrove through Hyde Park fully masked in 1906, and even plunged into\r\nthe Serpentine to rescue a boy she presumed to be drowning. The modern\r\npoliceman on duty probably had never heard of the old law forbidding\r\nmasks to be worn in the Park, and let the good lady pass with a smile.\r\n\r\nThe deplorable condition into which affairs had fallen is duly admitted\r\nin the Act of Parliament passed in 1695, the preamble of which recites:\r\n“Whereas the crimes of burglary and breaking open of houses in a\r\nfelonious manner, and the crime of stealing goods privately out of\r\nshops and warehouses, commonly called Shop-lifting, and the stealing of\r\nhorses, are of late years much increased.” However, the method adopted\r\nfor dealing with the growing evil shows how little the true means of\r\ndiminishing crime and handling criminals was then understood. The Act\r\nprovided that—\r\n\r\n“All and every person or persons, who shall apprehend and take any\r\nperson guilty of any of the felonies beforementioned, and prosecute\r\nhim, her, or them so apprehended and taken, until he, she, or they\r\nbe convicted of any of the aforesaid felonies, such apprehenders and\r\ntakers, for his, her, or their reward, upon every such conviction,\r\nwithout any fee or reward to be paid for the same, shall have\r\nforthwith, after every fresh conviction, a certificate, which shall be\r\nunder the hand or hands of a judge, Justice or justices, before whom\r\nevery such conviction shall be had, certifying such conviction, etc.\r\n... which certificate shall and may be once assigned over and no more,\r\nand the original proprietor of such certificate, or the assignee of the\r\nsame, whomsoever of them shall have the interest therein, by virtue\r\nthereof and this present Act, shall and may be discharged of and from\r\nall and all manner of parish and ward wherein such felony or felonies\r\nshall be committed, and such party or assignee is hereby declared to be\r\ndischarged therefrom.”\r\n\r\nA fee of one shilling was charged for the enrolling of this\r\ncertificate, which became known as the “Tyburn Ticket,” and acted as a\r\nsmall incentive to the righteous to bring the thief to the gallows. It\r\nremained in use for more than a century.\r\n\r\nAs late as 1772 the state of Hyde Park was so bad that a bell used\r\nto be rung at stated intervals in Kensington, to gather together\r\npeople who had ventured from London and were wishing to return. When a\r\nsufficient number had assembled the party started eastwards, and were\r\nsafely escorted through the lonely neighbourhood of Hyde Park by the\r\nguard. Mr. Horsley, the artist, mentions in his _Memoirs_ that a friend\r\nof his childhood could remember this arrangement, and he himself knew\r\nthe time the Park gates were closed at eight o’clock in the evenings.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tyburn Ticket.\r\n\r\n_Preserved in the Guildhall Library. Market value in the 18th Century\r\nwas from £25 to £30._]\r\n\r\nLondon was, indeed, unsafe at night until well into the last century.\r\nIn fact, when the great Duke of Wellington was speaking in the House\r\nof Lords in favour of the Police Act, he was able to quote—as proof\r\nof need of an efficient police force—that his mother’s coach had been\r\nstopped in Grosvenor Place, and valuables, money, and jewellery carried\r\noff.\r\n\r\nTwice at least Queen Mary reviewed the troops in Hyde Park when her\r\nhusband was absent on the Continent; not, it would seem, with very good\r\ngrace. “I go,” she wrote to him, “to Hyde Park to see the Militia drawn\r\nout there next Monday; you may believe I go against my will.” It was\r\nnecessary to keep well-drilled regiments in readiness for action in\r\nthose troublous times, and this great open space formed an excellent\r\nmanœuvring ground. James, on the French side of the Channel, was always\r\na source of danger, while Jacobite risings might occur at any time, and\r\nWilliam’s wars in the Netherlands were no light matter. In 1692 it was\r\ndeemed wise to be ready for a French invasion, and trained bands in the\r\nCities of London and Westminster were assembled to the number of ten\r\nthousand.\r\n\r\nIn the closing days of the year 1694, Queen Mary lay dying at\r\nKensington Palace. News then spread but slowly. A man was seen lurking\r\namong the bushes and swampy thickets in Hyde Park and round Kensington\r\nGardens. As darkness gathered he became somewhat bolder, and kept in\r\nsufficient communication with passers-by to find out how events were\r\ngoing. This vigil was kept in order that he might at once convey the\r\nnews to James II. at St. Germains. Mary died in the early hours of\r\nthe morning on 28th December, and long before daylight the Jesuit\r\nwas making his way towards the coast to cross the Channel with the\r\nnews for King James. It is related that the exile was in great grief,\r\nnot only at his daughter’s death, but because there had been no\r\nreconciliation, nor was there even a message for him from the deathbed.\r\n\r\nAfter William and Mary came Queen Anne. She was not the person to\r\nbecome a leader of society and raise its tone. She seldom did anything\r\nsmart. A good, homely soul, wrapped up in her domestic surroundings,\r\nshe tried hard to be an example to those about her, and help forward\r\nanything beneficial to her kingdom. But political personages rather\r\nthan Society gathered round her. She took little interest in sport or\r\ngames, and her drives in the Park were more for the benefit of her\r\nhealth than to attend social functions or big shows.\r\n\r\nPoor Anne! The mother of nineteen children, all of whom died in infancy\r\nor early youth, those rows of little coffins in Westminster Abbey tell\r\nin heartbreaking accents the tragedy of her life. She was afflicted\r\nwith gout, and, having lost her husband, to whom she was devoted, no\r\nwonder she found it easier to let Society take care of itself, and\r\nSarah Jennings and Mrs. Masham rule over her.\r\n\r\nSociety did go on, but went too far and too fast.\r\n\r\nThere is an old Satire containing many quaint descriptions of the modes\r\nof the day in Hyde Park.

The daughter of\r\nthe Duke of Kingston, she shone not merely for her ready wit, and in\r\nthe Courts of George I. and George II., but she introduced inoculation\r\nfor smallpox in England. Not only did Mary II. in England and Louis XV.\r\nof France die of smallpox; but William III. and Caroline Wilhelmina,\r\nwife of George II., were fearfully disfigured by its ravages. Even\r\nkings were not immune. One has only to read the Correspondence of those\r\ndays, and the frequent mention of beautiful women and comely men marked\r\nwith that frightful disease, to realise the strides science has made in\r\nconquering this malady. One wonders what would be Lady Mary’s piquant\r\nremark could she now see the enormous development of inoculation for\r\nother diseases made by science to-day.\r\n\r\nAs a child she became the toast of the Kit-cat Club, one of the\r\nfirst of these institutions ever formed. The exigencies of the times\r\nnecessitated gentlemen having some place where those of like politics\r\nand tastes could meet; and several Whig noblemen and esquires held\r\ntheir assemblies at a public-house “with the sign of the Cat and\r\nFiddle,” in Shire Lane, which was kept by Christopher Kat. Amongst its\r\nmembers were the most distinguished men of the day, and when politics\r\nassumed a less pronounced tone, men of literary and other merits were\r\naccepted as members. This club finally moved to Barn Elms, and is known\r\nas Ranelagh to-day.\r\n\r\nAmong the habitués of the Park was Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough, who\r\ntook a prominent place in the Society of this reign, while another\r\nimpressive figure was the Duchess of Buckingham. The Duke of Buckingham\r\nbought the house that Lord Arlington had built in the Mulberry\r\nGardens, and changed its name to Buckingham House, the year after\r\nAnne’s accession. His lady was the illegitimate daughter of James II.\r\nand the Countess of Dorchester, and never was a real Royal Princess\r\nmore exacting as to regal precedence and etiquette. On the anniversary\r\nof the execution of her grandfather, Charles I., she used to sit in\r\nBuckingham House in state, attired in deep mourning; and from both\r\nAnne and George I. she claimed the right of driving through the Royal\r\nprivate enclosures near St. James’s Palace. When her only son died,\r\nshe demanded from the Duchess of Marlborough the loan of the wonderful\r\ncoach that had borne the body of the Duke from Marlborough House to St.\r\nPaul’s, and, on receiving a curt refusal, ordered one to exceed it in\r\ngrandeur to be built. Thereupon she made all preparations for her own\r\nobsequies, and wrote epitaphs for her son and herself, insisting that\r\ntheir remains should be buried in Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Drinking Well in Hyde Park.]\r\n\r\nIt is well to imagine the setting in which these leaders of Society\r\nshowed themselves in their daily drives. Wild and beautiful, no doubt,\r\nwas the Hyde Park of Queen Anne, but it was not the luxurious garden\r\nthat we now know. Let us obliterate for a moment from our mind’s eye\r\nthe well-kept grounds of our favourite resort, with the waters of the\r\nSerpentine sparkling in the sun, and replace them by thickets and\r\nbrushwood growing on marshy ground, here and there stagnant pools, with\r\nthe pungent smell that ever pervades any tract of swampy forest-land;\r\nwhile instead of the light iron railing that encloses Hyde Park of\r\nto-day, there stood the solid wall which had taken the place of Henry\r\nVIII.’s wooden paling.\r\n\r\nIn 1712, Anne issued further orders “for the better keeping of\r\nHyde Park.” Gatekeepers were always to be on duty, and not to sell\r\nintoxicating liquors. No one was to leap or ride over ditches and\r\nfences, or to break the latter, and this also applied to the banks of\r\nponds. No person was to ride over the grass on the south side of the\r\ngravelled coach road except Henry Wise, who was permitted to cross\r\nthe part of the Park leading to the door in the Park wall next his\r\nplantation. Nobody should cut or lop trees, and the law forbidding\r\nhackney coaches was extended to stage coaches, chaises with one horse,\r\ncarts, waggons, and funerals.\r\n\r\nGardens were becoming the fashion at this time, and Evelyn twice\r\nmentions visiting the wonderful nursery gardens belonging to Mr. Wise\r\nat Brompton, the site of famous nurseries until quite a recent date.\r\n\r\nA great sensation was caused a few years later, in the reign of George\r\nI., when some men of good birth one day hired a hackney coach, drawn\r\nby six horses in the most terrible state of decay. Scavengers were\r\nmounted on the box as footmen; chimney-sweepers acted as postillions\r\nand shoeblacks ran behind.\r\n\r\nThe originators of the “joke” themselves entered the coach, and,\r\nmaking a dash through the gates of Hyde Park, drove their dying steeds\r\nfuriously to the Ring and took their turn round it before they could be\r\nprevented.\r\n\r\nAlthough Queen Anne did not herself encourage people to waste their\r\ntime in the Parks, her reign saw Society considerably broadened,\r\nsomewhat to the disgust of the older families. The City merchants on\r\nthe Sabbath sallied forth with their fine ladies to join the habitual\r\nfrequenters, and the Church parade of gallants and dames became an\r\nimportant function.\r\n\r\nSociety spent most of its Sundays there in the season, meeting and\r\nchatting just as Society does to-day, and so began the custom of\r\nsitting out on sunny Sunday afternoons, as is still the fashion.\r\nChurch-going was merely an opportunity for show, of bowing to\r\nacquaintances who were present at the prayer-meeting, and probably\r\nmaking arrangements for further gossip at a later hour of the day,\r\nespecially at St. Paul’s. The fashionable service was in the afternoon,\r\nafter which people again repaired to the Park.\r\n\r\nColley Cibber, in his _Apology for my Life_, writes:\r\n\r\n“Kynaston (the celebrated actor) at that time was so beautiful a youth\r\nthat the Ladies of Quality prided themselves in taking him with them in\r\ntheir Coaches to Hyde Park, in his Theatrical Habit, after the Play,\r\nwhich in those days they might have sufficient time to do, because\r\nPlays then were us’d to begin at four a-clock, the Hour that People of\r\nthe same Rank are now going to Dinner.”\r\n\r\nWhat would poor old Colley Cibber, who was so surprised at a four\r\no’clock dinner, say to the fashionable hour in London of eight or half\r\npast? Everything is later. We get up later, breakfast later, lunch\r\nlater; have instituted “tea” since those days, and have our dinner\r\nwhen those good folk had their suppers. And what would the theatrical\r\nworld say to a performance beginning at four o’clock in London,\r\nalthough in many German towns it still starts at six; but then in the\r\nlittle German towns people dine at one o’clock, as they used to do in\r\nEngland formerly. Only in Berlin does Society wear dress clothes, and\r\ntake the meal after seven o’clock in full feckle.\r\n\r\nKnowing the attractions of Hyde Park for a certain section of great\r\nfolk in the reign of Edward VII., it is amusing to read the _Tattler_\r\nof two hundred years ago speaking of the strange infatuation of walking\r\nin the Park in spring. The gossiping writer says that\r\n\r\n“No frost, snow, nor east wind can hinder a large set of people from\r\ngoing to the park in February, no dust nor heat in June. And this is\r\ncome to such an intrepid regularity, that those agreeable creatures\r\nthat would shriek at an hind-wheel in a deep gutter, are not afraid in\r\ntheir proper sphere of the disorder and danger of seven crowded rings.”\r\n\r\nLater, Addison, remarking on this same custom, points out the\r\nmischief-making done by the servants when waiting for their masters and\r\nmistresses at the entrance to the Park: “The next place of resort,”\r\nhe says, “wherein the servile world are let loose, is at the entrance\r\nof Hyde Park, while the gentry are at the Ring. Hither people bring\r\ntheir lacqueys out of state, and here it is that all they say at their\r\ntables, and act in their houses, is communicated to the whole town.”\r\n\r\nWhether these comments put an end to servants wasting their time,\r\nwagging their tongues, and their general want of law and order while\r\nwaiting at the Park, is unrecorded, but the rule forbidding them\r\naccess to Kensington Gardens was still in existence, as quoted in\r\nthe Introduction: “Working people, servants in livery, and dogs were\r\nnot allowed in Kensington Gardens. On the occasion of a storm the\r\nrule was relaxed, and footmen, for once, were allowed to bring in the\r\numbrellas.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nIN GEORGIAN DAYS\r\n\r\n\r\nSociety from the time of the Revolution had gradually drifted into an\r\nindependent existence, and was no longer dominated by the influence of\r\nthe Court. The hatred entertained by Queen Mary, the Consort of William\r\nIII., towards the supporters of her father was probably responsible\r\nfor this in a great measure. The Jacobites in their turn entered into\r\nintrigue. As Queen Anne’s reign drew to a close, often beneath those\r\nold trees in Hyde Park, meetings were arranged under the very eyes of\r\nthe Whigs. Signs and tokens communicated place and time, surrounding\r\nthe conspirators still with that touch of romance which always clung to\r\nthe fortunes of the Stuarts.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile another vast social change had been creeping over London and\r\nLondon life.\r\n\r\nThe Great Fire had proved a dominating factor in the growth and\r\ndevelopment of Society in the capital. The poor, starving, homeless\r\nwretches at Islington and Moorfields, in 1666, could see nothing in the\r\ndisaster but calamity and despair. The wealthy merchant bemoaned his\r\nlosses. Those who had lost nothing and suffered nothing regarded the\r\nflames as a disinfectant from the Plague, an unrivalled opportunity\r\nfor improving streets and houses. Despondency soon gave place to the\r\nexcitement and interests of rebuilding the town. Many of the wealthy\r\nmerchants and aristocratic residents of the City, finding themselves\r\nhomeless, erected houses in Holborn and thereabouts, a neighbourhood\r\nwhich before that time had been occupied by mansions of great noblemen,\r\nthe laws of Elizabeth and James I. against building between Temple Bar\r\nand Whitehall having kept the district fairly clear.\r\n\r\nThis exodus from the City had the same effect in those days that the\r\nmodern red brick villa has on the present generation. The aristocracy\r\nfled before it and moved westwards. Lord Burlington went to Sir John\r\nDenham’s house, enlarged it, and named it Burlington House; Lord\r\nBerkeley built Berkeley House, which was burnt down later, on the site\r\nwhere Devonshire House now stands. Many others of the nobility followed\r\nsuit. Added to this, the introduction of the coach brought country\r\ngentry so much more frequently to town that they also needed houses of\r\ntheir own, and joined the westward “trek.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Entrance to Hyde Park on a Sunday.\r\n\r\n_From a Print in the Crace Collection, British Museum._]\r\n\r\nThe student of social development finds a yet deeper change in the\r\nmigration. Class distinction became strongly marked. It was no longer\r\nconsidered dignified to belong to the City of London, and trade\r\ndevolved on the middle class, who henceforth held positions that had\r\nbeen filled by the younger branches of the nobility. Thus the Society\r\nof the City of Westminster looked down on the Society of the City of\r\nLondon, and nowhere was this more emphasised than in Hyde Park, which\r\nthe aristocracy regarded as their own. It was only on Sundays that the\r\nCity of London hied thither, and on these occasions My Lady turned\r\nup her nose and My Lord sniffed high in the air, while the Londoners\r\nstared and remarked on the fine inhabitants of the western city.\r\n\r\nUnder the Georges this feeling did not abate; in fact, during the week\r\nthe high-born aristocracy regarded Hyde Park as so exclusively their\r\nhappy playground, that in the early Georgian days ladies and gentlemen\r\nspoke without introductions. Everybody knew who everybody else was. The\r\nchief course of study the Society lady pursued was that of heraldry and\r\npedigree. It must be borne in mind that the aristocracy were not so\r\nnumerous as in these times. At the beginning of the eighteenth century\r\nthe whole population of London was but half a million.\r\n\r\nLivery servants were allowed to enter Hyde Park, although still\r\nexcluded from St. James’s and Kensington Gardens, and when ladies\r\nwalked in the Park they were attended by a flunkey carrying a long\r\nstaff as his rod of office, and often by a little black slave-boy.\r\n\r\nManners and morals were sadly missing in this fashionable centre. The\r\nlicentiousness established under Charles II. had spread and thrived\r\nthroughout the realm, and George I. and his son publicly encouraged\r\nit. In fact, when the former attended the theatre he was carried\r\nin his sedan-chair with a guard before and behind, and his two\r\nmistresses—popularly known as the “Elephant” and the “Maypole,” from\r\ntheir respective breadth and length,—brought up the rear, borne by men\r\nin the Royal livery.\r\n\r\nIt is hard for the Londoner of 1908 to realise that two hundred years\r\nago neither children, nor the “man in the street,” nor the loafer, nor\r\nthe orator, were permitted to enter Hyde Park. In fact, the only part\r\nthe poor labouring folk ever knew of it was its high brick wall.\r\n\r\nWhen the Jacobite risings were fermenting, a military camp was formed\r\nin Hyde Park. The newspapers contain grand accounts of the rejoicings\r\namong the troops, and the feast given to the men by the Duke of\r\nMontague, who was in command, in honour of the Prince of Wales’s\r\nbirthday.\r\n\r\nJoseph Addison, writing to a friend in June 1715, says:\r\n\r\n“SIR,—Yesterday the King reviewed the Horse Guards in Hyde Park.\r\nHis Majesty made so good a figure on horseback, was followed by\r\nsuch prodigious numbers of people who pressed about him to kiss his\r\nstirrups, and huzza’d with such acclamations of joy and good-will, that\r\nit is hoped by his friends that His Majesty will take more frequent\r\nopportunities of being seen by the meaner sort of his people. One of\r\nthe mob called out ‘High Church’ near the King at his going out of the\r\nParke, for which he was immediately knocked and used very scurvily by\r\nthe rest.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN OF HYDE PARK _as it was in 1725_.\r\n\r\n_From a Plan of the Parish of Sᵗ. George Hanover Square, in the Vestry\r\nRoom of that Parish._\r\n\r\n  _From Rocque’s Map._]\r\n\r\nAn incident that happened during their stay well shows the temper of\r\nthe times. May 29th came round, and two soldiers picked a sprig of oak\r\nfrom the old trees and stuck it in their caps,—a mere boyish fancy,\r\nno doubt, but one that savoured strongly of Jacobitism, for it called\r\nto mind Charles I., as well as the birthday and return of Charles II.\r\nSo these unfortunate youths were drummed out of the army, and flogged\r\nalmost to death.\r\n\r\nMay Fair, which had been abolished in 1708, was revived for the\r\namusement of the soldiers. This fair first originated in the May-Day\r\ngames that were held in Brookfields, on the banks of the Tyburn before\r\nit crossed Piccadilly. The whole thing had become so disorderly,\r\nhowever, that it was stopped by Queen Anne, probably in consideration\r\nfor the owners of new houses near the fair ground. After its revival\r\nthe fair was held annually until 1760. While the camp thus had\r\nbrought disorder to Mayfair, it was a safeguard to Kensington, for it\r\ntemporarily dispersed the bands of highwaymen who infested that part.\r\n\r\nThere are many records extant describing the immediate surroundings\r\nof Hyde Park at this time, those in the Muniment Room at Westminster\r\nAbbey being of special interest. Among them is a plan of the area of\r\nKnightsbridge abutting on Hyde Park Corner in 1719. The West-bourne\r\nflowed out where the Albert Gate now stands. On, or close to, the site\r\nof the French Embassy was the Lazar Hospital and some stocks, and\r\nnearer Hyde Park Corner, the Knightsbridge Chapel. On the opposite side\r\nof the road stood the “Roase Inn,” to which belonged a tract of land\r\nstretching east, and containing both a smithy and sheep-pens belonging\r\nto the inn. All this sounds strange, and yet there are several old\r\nfarmhouses standing right in the heart of London to-day. The “Roase”\r\nwas in existence until 1860, and was then known as “The Rose and\r\nCrown.” What a different scene was this ordinary drinking house from\r\nthat on the other side of the brick wall.\r\n\r\nThe 18th century were the days of the beaux, who appeared in Hyde Park\r\nin their chairs to lounge, chaff the orange-girls and flower-sellers,\r\nand exchange comments with the fair occupants of the coaches and\r\ncalèches.\r\n\r\nIn the Ring these chariots now acquired a splendour which represented\r\ngreat wealth. A curious incident had happened in the desire of Beau\r\nFielding to figure as a descendant of the House of Hapsburg, from\r\nwhich he claimed descent. Appearing in a chariot of unparalleled\r\ngorgeousness, with the Hapsburg arms upon it, he excited the ire of\r\nLord Denbigh, who had the undisputed right to the arms. This nobleman\r\nengaged a house-painter to await Fielding’s arrival in the Ring, and at\r\nthe first opportunity this individual, taking the brush from a huge can\r\nof yellow paint which he carried, proceeded to cover the splendid coach\r\nof the aspirant with daubs, entirely obliterating the offending arms.\r\nBeau Fielding was left with the choice of retiring amidst the laughter\r\nthe event created, or of reviving the joke each time he drove round the\r\nfavoured circle.\r\n\r\nWe talk of our gay throng in Hyde Park to-day, as one of the most\r\nbrilliant gatherings of beauty and fashion in the world. But what must\r\nthe gorgeousness have been of those scenes a century and a half ago,\r\nwhen men as well as women wore bright colours and rich materials, and\r\nadded airs and graces to their frills and laces?\r\n\r\nRetiring to bed in the early hours of the morning, the dandy of the\r\nearly Georges lay till noon, and then donned a shirt much befrilled,\r\nbelaced, and embroidered, for the benefit of any chance visitor who\r\nmight call. His periwig lay in full display somewhere in the room,\r\ncurled, powdered, and scented according to the latest fashion.\r\nAbout midday he rose and performed his toilet, donning his gorgeous\r\nsilken hose and coloured shoes glorified with silver buckles, his\r\nvelvet breeches, embroidered waistcoat, and silken coat, then his\r\nperiwig; and, posing before his mirror, he arranged his gay cravat,\r\nstuck on his patches, painted his face if necessary, scented his\r\nlace handkerchief—the fashionable lace was Valenciennes—attached his\r\ndangling sword, and took his meal. After this, his mirror was again\r\nresorted to for adjusting his hat in exactly the proper manner, his\r\nsnuff-box was the finishing touch, and his chairmen then bore to the\r\nPark, or some other pleasure resort, this gentleman of fortune whose\r\npersonal attire alone must have represented hundreds of pounds.\r\n\r\nAny one who had been in the army always wore his scarlet uniform,\r\nwhile the private individual bedecked himself with coats of silks and\r\nbrocades, velvets and satins, embroidered with gold. These garments\r\nthe habitués of Hyde Park carried with such graceful bearing that a\r\nCity of London man could be discerned at once from the gaucheries he\r\nperformed. Few of the merchants wore silken coats, for so late as this\r\nthe sumptuary laws of Elizabeth could be traced in the various grades\r\nand trades of the people. Even in 1908 have we not the blue smock of\r\nthe butcher and our ’Varsity gowns surviving voluntarily as a relic of\r\nthese old laws?\r\n\r\nThe daily appearance in the Park meant much more to the early\r\neighteenth-century ladies than it does to Society dames of the present\r\nday. They saw little of their husbands, and were—so far as their\r\nhome life went—often alone. They read practically nothing; in fact,\r\ntheir intellects were starved. Dress was their one and only idea, and\r\nengrossed much of the day, until they went to the Park in their grand\r\nequipages drawn by four horses, running footmen preceding, others\r\nfollowing.\r\n\r\nThe ignorance of the age was deplorable. The gatherings of the wits and\r\nliterary men, so famous under Anne, had been dispersed by the strong\r\npolitical force of Sir Robert Walpole. Addison, Swift, and Pope alone\r\nremained in prominence.\r\n\r\nThe Duchesses of Marlborough and Buckingham still vied with each other\r\nas to who should be the most important factor in Society. The Duchess\r\nof Shrewsbury; Miss Lepell, who afterwards married Lord Hervey; Mary\r\nBellenden, the lady who refused the attentions of the Prince of Wales\r\nand married Colonel Campbell; Miss Howe, Lord Hervey, Sir Robert\r\nWalpole, and Lord Chesterfield, were all familiar figures in the haunts\r\nof Hyde Park. Added to these was Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, whose\r\nsprightly conversation was in great request in those days.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOLLY LEPELL, afterwards Lady Hervey.]\r\n\r\nHer tongue and pen had a somewhat sharp edge. She waged war on the\r\nignorance of the day, and her _Letters_ have come down to us full of\r\nthe culture and cleverness for which she was distinguished. Writing to\r\nthe Countess of Mar in 1723, she said:\r\n\r\n“Your old friend Mrs. Lowther is still fair and young, and in pale pink\r\nevery night in the Park; but after being highly in favour, poor I am in\r\nutter disgrace, without my being able to guess wherefore, except she\r\nfancied me the author or abettor of two vile ballads written on her\r\n‘dying adventure,’ which I am so innocent of that I never saw.”\r\n\r\nThe explanation of the “dying adventure” is too good to pass over.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lowther was a sister of Lord Lonsdale, unmarried, and of high\r\nrepute. All middle-aged unmarried women were addressed as “Mrs.” in\r\nthose days, just as wives of our own time look upon that title as their\r\nprerogative. She happened to be sitting at breakfast with a friend when\r\na new footman—an awkward country lad—announced “there was one as begged\r\nto see her.”\r\n\r\n“What is his name?” she inquired.\r\n\r\n“Don’t know,” was the reply.\r\n\r\n“What sort of a person is he—a gentleman?”\r\n\r\n“Can’t say rightly.”\r\n\r\n“Go and ask him his business.”\r\n\r\nThe footman disappeared and returned with a broad grin on his face:\r\n\r\n“Why, Madam, he says as how—he says he is——”\r\n\r\n“Well, what does he say, fool?”\r\n\r\n“He says he is one as dies for your Ladyship.”\r\n\r\n“Dies for me!” exclaimed the lady, annoyed beyond measure at the smile\r\non the faces of her friend and the footman. “Was there ever such a\r\npiece of insolence? Turn him out of my house this minute. And, hark ye,\r\nshut the door in his face!”\r\n\r\nThe yokel obeyed, but setting about the matter with more force than\r\nthe visitor would put up with, there was a scuffle, the neighbourhood\r\nwas roused, the constable or watchman arrived, and the affair became\r\nserious. Finally, when matters were arranged by the arm of the law, and\r\nthe caller could calmly explain himself, he proved to be one of Mrs.\r\nLowther’s tradesmen, a dyer whom she often employed to freshen up her\r\ngowns.\r\n\r\nOne can quite imagine the glee with which the ladies related the story\r\nto their friends when they saw the pink gown appearing in the distance\r\nevery evening.\r\n\r\nLady Mary seems to have bestowed much criticism on her contemporaries,\r\nboth male and female. Pope—who, by the way, spent many of his young\r\ndays near Hyde Park—was to her the “little wasp of Twickenham,” and in\r\nanother letter of hers we find the following, in which runs a rich vein\r\nof sarcasm:\r\n\r\n“Lady Hervey makes the top figure in town, and is so good a show twice\r\na week at the Drawing-room, and twice more at the Opera, for the\r\nentertainment of the public.... Lady Hervey is more delightful than\r\never, and such a politician that if people were not blind to merit, she\r\nwould govern the nation.”\r\n\r\nThese two instances are, perhaps, typical of the chatter that was rife\r\nin those daily drives and walks in Hyde Park when George II. came to\r\nthe throne. Men enjoyed the gossip, as they do now. Would that we had\r\na bioscope that would reproduce those picturesque groups lounging\r\nunder the trees: Lord Hervey with his debonair appearance, the worldly\r\nLord Chesterfield, and the numerous others who figure in the witty\r\ncorrespondences which became an art in the eighteenth century. Hyde\r\nPark supplied the subjects for many a long letter from Horace Walpole,\r\nGeorge Selwyn, and their friends, written in such racy style that one\r\ncan almost hear the chuckle with which a bit of “talk about town” was\r\nindited, or the approving laugh of the recipient as he read.\r\n\r\nUnder George II. change was busy. The spirit of gardening was abroad.\r\nPeople were tired of clipped hedges, trimmed shrubs, and the formality\r\nof the Dutch style. Queen Caroline beautified Kensington Gardens, and\r\nin doing so robbed Hyde Park of three hundred acres to give her greater\r\nscope. “Natural” gardening was the vogue, and this addition leant\r\nitself to her scheme.\r\n\r\nThe greatest change of all, for which habitués of the Park remain\r\nindebted to Queen Caroline, Consort of George II., was the Serpentine.\r\nIt is still the finest sheet of water in any of the London parks, and\r\nhas entirely altered the aspect from the large area over which it is\r\nvisible.\r\n\r\nWhy “Serpentine”?\r\n\r\nPerhaps five persons out of six, if asked to give the reason why this\r\nparticular name was applied to the newly fashioned lake, would not\r\nbe able to guess correctly. It was so called because of its shape. In\r\nfact, the bend is very small, barely noticeable, yet in its day it\r\nmarked a revolt from the existing order of things. Hitherto no one in\r\nlaying out ornamental water in a landscape garden had dared to depart\r\nfrom the perfectly straight line or square form which had been brought\r\nover from Holland, and was considered the acme of good taste. Queen\r\nCaroline was wise enough to break away from these absurd limitations,\r\nand the example she was among the first to set has since been followed\r\nwith the happiest results. But so established was the idea of a square\r\nor oblong lake from which she departed, that map-makers (as will be\r\nseen in the accompanying map) represented the stretch of water in a\r\nquadrilateral form for some years.\r\n\r\nSome ten or a dozen separate pools and ponds existed in Hyde Park\r\nbefore the work was undertaken. They were fed by the West-bourne,\r\nwhich trickled from one to another, and, leaving the grounds at their\r\nsouthern boundary, finally found a way into the river Thames. In the\r\nforest days these were the haunt of the heron, which is especially\r\nmentioned by Henry VIII. among the game to be strictly preserved. About\r\nthese pools and marshes, as we know, bluff King Hal and his daughter\r\nElizabeth flew their hawks. Later the brook itself became greatly\r\nfouled, and the ponds, which were almost stagnant, an offence rather\r\nthan an addition to the amenities of the Park.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HYDE PARK in 1746.\r\n\r\n   _From Rocque’s map of London._]\r\n\r\nQueen Caroline had the advice and assistance of Charles Withers,\r\nthen Surveyor-General of Woods and Forests, in constructing the\r\nSerpentine. George II., believing that all the cost was being borne\r\nout of the Queen’s privy purse, generously abstained from interference\r\nin her schemes. It was not until after her death that he discovered\r\nthat £20,000 of his own money had been expended in this and other\r\nimprovements in the Park and gardens. The West-bourne was first drained\r\nby an embankment being thrown across it. The soil excavated for the\r\nfoundation of the single great lake was then dumped down to raise the\r\nlevel of the ground at the south end of Kensington Gardens. On the\r\nsummit of the little hill so formed was placed a small temple, which\r\nhas since disappeared.\r\n\r\nA couple of hundred men were employed on the work, which was begun in\r\n1730. The “Old Lodge” was destroyed in order to form the new ornamental\r\nwater, and the Ring, which had been the vogue for upwards of a century,\r\nwent with it. The latter had ceased to be a gay and fashionable resort\r\nwhen the camp afforded a counter-attraction, and never recovered its\r\npopularity. Moreover, Newmarket had become the great racing centre,\r\nand the Ring thus passed out of existence ingloriously. The cost of\r\nthe Serpentine is said to have been only £6000. Some years before, the\r\nChelsea Waterworks had been granted the rights of supplying the new\r\nwestern suburbs with water from Hyde Park and St. James’s Park; but\r\nthey now accepted compensation of £2500, and handed over their rights\r\nin Hyde Park for the new design. The Serpentine continued to derive its\r\nwaters from the West-bourne until the stream became too polluted by\r\nthe increase of population on its banks, when it was turned underground.\r\n\r\nMajor Hussey, of His Majesty’s Board of Works, kindly tells me that the\r\npresent arrangements are as follows:\r\n\r\n“Water is pumped into the Serpentine from shallow wells in St. James’s\r\nPark and also from a deep well at the head of the Serpentine; in the\r\nlatter case, however, it is usually first pumped to the Round Pond,\r\nwhence it returns by gravity to the Serpentine.\r\n\r\n“Water can also, if necessary, be let into the Serpentine from the\r\nWater Board mains. No water now enters from the Westbourne Stream,\r\nwhich was originally the only supply.\r\n\r\n“The Round Pond, the Serpentine, Buckingham Palace Lake, and St.\r\nJames’s Park Lake, are all connected in the order named, and water can\r\nflow through the series.\r\n\r\n“The fountains at the head of the Serpentine play by pressure from the\r\nRound Pond. If necessary they can be worked from the engines direct.\r\nThe water pumped to the Serpentine from St. James’s Park flows through\r\nan iron pipe until it reaches the east end of the Serpentine; thence it\r\npasses along an old brick culvert and enters the Serpentine near its\r\nhead in Kensington Gardens.\r\n\r\n“The opening up of this culvert a short time ago for the purposes of\r\ncleaning, may have given rise to the report that an old culvert had\r\nrecently been discovered.”\r\n\r\nThat Queen Caroline made such extensive improvements in the Park “for\r\nthe good of Londoners generally,” was much doubted at the time. Indeed,\r\nthere was some talk of a Royal Palace being erected there, and of\r\nfurther encroachments. Nevertheless, Queen Caroline’s work has proved a\r\nlasting benefit to the chief pleasure ground of the Metropolis.\r\n\r\nThe King was busy meanwhile with a new road through the Park to\r\nKensington. The Princess Amelia was devoted to horses and riding, and\r\nfrequently appeared in Hyde Park. George II.’s Road appears to have\r\nbeen assigned for carriages simply passing through the Park, while\r\nthe older way of William III., known as “The King’s Old Road,” was\r\nallotted to the dallying of pleasure-seekers, and the term “Rotten Row”\r\ncame to be applied to it by the succeeding generation. This is said to\r\nbe a corruption of “Route du Roi,” but other writers derive it from\r\n“rotteran,” to muster. The new road was the cause of many disasters,\r\ncoaches frequently sticking in the mud and overturning. The King’s\r\ndaughters were driving into London on pleasure bent one evening, when\r\na chaise capsized and the horse attached fell under the feet of the\r\nleaders in the royal coach-and-four. The young princesses were not\r\nhurt, but were so frightened that they returned home, and were bled,\r\naccording to the custom of that time.\r\n\r\nRiding became a passion. Favourite steeds were shown off in Hyde\r\nPark, wagers were made, and just as we proclaim that our Charron, our\r\nPanhard, our Mercedes, or our Daimler did such and such a distance in\r\nso many hours without a check, so in the early half of the eighteenth\r\ncentury the long journey accomplished at top speed by some favourite\r\nhorse was the talk of the day. It is said that the Duchess of Bedford\r\nappeared in the Row in a particularly smart riding-habit of dark blue\r\ncloth with white facings, which George II. admired so much that he took\r\nthe idea for his new naval uniforms in 1748, and abolished the scarlet\r\ndress hitherto worn by ships’ officers.\r\n\r\nHyde Park was more than ever the playground of the higher classes.\r\nCricket matches, first introduced in the reign of William III., were\r\nthe fashion; teams were formed from the ranks of the nobility, and\r\ngraced by royalty, who batted merrily across the sward on summer\r\ndays. Though cricket is no longer permitted in Hyde Park, it is still\r\nplayed in its much more beautiful rival, Regent’s Park. Skating on the\r\nSerpentine, too, was established on the first occasion that Jack Frost\r\ncast his silent grip over the new ornamental water.\r\n\r\nQueen Caroline instituted a Drawing-Room every Sunday at Kensington\r\nPalace, and thither beauty and birth flocked in costly array, and then\r\nto the Park. She was a clever diplomat, possessing great tact and a far\r\nbetter idea of ruling than her husband. Under her sway literature was\r\nencouraged, though Society remained as licentious as ever.\r\n\r\nMeantime Hyde Park was still the goal of that western migration.\r\nGrosvenor Gate had been erected in the reign of George I. at the\r\nexpense of the inhabitants of the new mansions. Viscount Lanesborough\r\nhad treked as far as Hyde Park Corner, and built what his friends\r\ncalled “his country house.” In fact, he himself had the following words\r\ninscribed on its front:\r\n\r\n  “It is my delight to be\r\n  Both in town and country.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: St. George’s Hospital and the Original “Tattersall’s” at\r\nHyde Park Corner.\r\n\r\n_From Print in the Crace Collection, British Museum._] When, in 1733,\r\na “difference of doctors” arose at Westminster Hospital, the dissenting\r\nphysicians purchased Lanesborough House, and founded St. George’s\r\nHospital.\r\n\r\nLord Chesterfield, writing to Mr. Dayrolles in 1748, evidently thought\r\nlittle of the new quarter. “As my new house is situated among a parcel\r\nof thieves and murderers, I shall have occasion for a house-dog,” is\r\nthe best he can say. Chesterfield House was within a stone’s-throw of\r\nHill Street, where the famous Mrs. Montagu resided for a time. It was\r\nnot the spick-and-span locality of the present day, but was unpaved\r\nand ill-kept, the road being in a fearful condition, and Mrs. Montagu,\r\nthe originator of the “blue stocking” assemblies, gives a wonderful\r\ndescription of it in her _Lady of the Last Century_.\r\n\r\n“The ‘thieves and murderers’ were among the butchers of Mayfair and\r\nSheppard’s Market—not then cleared out for such streets as have since\r\nbeen erected on the site. Park Lane was then Tyburn Lane, and what\r\nwith the Fair of six weeks’ duration (with blackguardism and incidents\r\nof horror that will not bear repeating) and the monthly hangings at\r\nTyburn, from which half the drunken and yelling spectators poured\r\nthrough Mayfair, Hill Street, and adjacent outlets on their way to\r\nhome and fresh scenes of riot. Between the fair, the gallows, and the\r\nneighbouring rascalry, the district was not to be entered after dark\r\nwithout risk of the wayfarer being stripped by robbers. Footpads were\r\nas common between Hay Hill and Park Lane as highwaymen between Hounslow\r\nand Bagshot.”\r\n\r\nThe leaders of Society living near by found it easier to come\r\nfrequently into Hyde Park; it was so much a matter of routine that\r\neven those voluminous letters of the period speak as if that part\r\nof the day’s amusement was as necessary as their dinner. Instead of\r\ndriving some distance to the Park, they were now quite close; while\r\ntheir shopping was a much more serious affair, for until the end of\r\nthe century the best shops were still in Fleet Street, Ludgate Hill,\r\nand St. Paul’s Churchyard. This may account for the fashionable ladies\r\nvisiting Newgate so often, for they passed it on their shopping\r\nexpeditions, and probably in the absence of organised charity they\r\nfelt that they were doing a kindness in taking gifts to the condemned\r\ncriminals.\r\n\r\nFour years later, the Duke of Rutland moved to a country residence he\r\nhad built on the site of the present Rutland Gate, known in those days\r\nas “Well-fields,” and for which he paid a rental of thirty pounds per\r\nannum—the area being seven acres. To him was granted the privilege of a\r\nprivate gate into Hyde Park, and this was the origin of the small gate\r\nstill in existence on that spot.\r\n\r\nNear at hand stood Kingston House, erected by the beautiful Miss\r\nChudleigh and the Duke of Kingston, and there it was that the lady gave\r\nthose wonderful masquerades and fêtes described by Horace Walpole, to\r\ncelebrate the royal birthdays, at which the fireworks were so extensive\r\nthat stands were put up in Hyde Park for onlookers anxious to witness\r\nthe display.\r\n\r\nThe fact of seven hundred and thirty coaches passing Hyde Park Corner\r\nin three days is chronicled by Horace Walpole as a most wonderful\r\nthing. It is interesting to note in the Report of the recent Royal\r\nCommission on London traffic, that during a certain day between 8 a.m.\r\nand 8 p.m., 29,320 vehicles passed the Marble Arch.\r\n\r\n  _Traffic which passed Marble Arch from 8 a.m. to\r\n                8 p.m. on 6th July 1904._\r\n\r\n  Omnibuses                             4,745\r\n  Trade Vehicles                        7,314\r\n  Cabs and Carriages                   13,135\r\n  Barrows                                 310\r\n  Cycles                                3,816\r\n                                       ———\r\n  Total                                29,320\r\n                                       ======\r\n\r\n  _Traffic which passed Hyde Park Corner from 8 a.m.\r\n                to 8 p.m. on 26th July 1904._\r\n\r\n  Omnibuses                             6,635\r\n  Trade Vehicles, Selected Carriers       714\r\n    „      „      Others                7,249\r\n  Cabs, Two-wheel                       7,096\r\n    „   Four-wheel                      2,654\r\n  Carriages                             2,414\r\n                                       ———\r\n                                       26,762\r\n  Barrows                                 384\r\n  Cycles                                2,140\r\n                                       ———\r\n  Total                                29,286\r\n                                       ======\r\n\r\nThese numbers are much greater now—and the motors run into several\r\nthousands. Over 3000 vehicles pass the Marble Arch during a busy hour.\r\nMore traffic passes the scene of old Tyburne in twenty-four hours than\r\nany other spot in London, and yet the police organisation is so perfect\r\nthere is rarely a mishap.\r\n\r\nOf the most famous highwaymen of former times succeeding chapters will\r\ntell. The great rendezvous of the footpads who preyed on the passers-by\r\nwas at the “Halfway House” in Knightsbridge, and numerous attacks on\r\npeople in Hyde Park were recorded.\r\n\r\n“Lady Betty Waldegrave,” says her uncle, “was robbed t’other night in\r\nHyde Park, under the very noses of the lamps and the Patrole.”\r\n\r\nHorace Walpole and his relations seem to have been favourite prey for\r\nthe highwaymen. Elsewhere a story of a tragic encounter is given, but\r\nthere is a comic incident as well.\r\n\r\nOne night, about thirty years later than the period of which I am\r\nwriting, he was driving with a lady to Twickenham, to some evening\r\nentertainment, when the coach was held up by a highwayman. With the\r\ngreatest calmness and promptitude the lady at once handed the errant\r\nof the road her purse, bulging with money. The man seized it and rode\r\noff, well pleased with the spoil. But the lady was more happy still,\r\nfor she had come provided for emergencies. The purse only contained\r\n_counterfeit_ coin!\r\n\r\nTowards the end of George II.’s reign two figures appeared in Hyde Park\r\nthat startled Society—two fortuneless Irish girls, the daughters of an\r\nIrish squire, and nieces of Lord Mayo. Horace Walpole describes them as\r\n“the two handsomest women alive.” “Those goddesses the Gunnings” was\r\nMrs. Montagu’s term for them.\r\n\r\nSuch was their poverty, that when they were presented at Dublin Castle,\r\nMrs. Peg Woffington, the actress, lent them dresses in which to appear.\r\nThey made their début at the English Court in 1751, and from that time\r\ncrowds used to come daily to the Park to have a sight of them. They\r\nwere mobbed wherever they went; in fact, at the Drawing-Room when the\r\nyounger one, Elizabeth, was presented on her marriage with the Duke\r\nof Hamilton, the ladies clambered on to chairs and tables to see her.\r\nWalpole writes:\r\n\r\n“As you talk of our beauties, I shall tell you a new story of the\r\nGunnings, who make more noise than any of their predecessors since\r\nthe days of Helen, though neither of them, nor anything about them,\r\nhas yet been _teterrima belli causa_. They went the other day to\r\nsee Hampton Court; as they were going into the Beauty-room, another\r\ncompany arrived; the housekeeper said, ‘This way, ladies, here are\r\nthe beauties.’ The Gunnings flew into a passion, and asked her what\r\nshe meant; they came to see the palace, not to be shown as a sight\r\nthemselves.”\r\n\r\nThey were fêted and feasted by everybody, and their own heads evidently\r\nbecame turned as well as other people’s. It was at Chesterfield House\r\nthat the younger sister met the Duke of Hamilton, who fell in love\r\nat first sight, but the story of their romantic marriage with the\r\ncurtain ring is well known. The elder one married Lord Coventry about a\r\nfortnight later. Both romances were a godsend to the gossiping habitués\r\nof Hyde Park, who, however, were plenteously supplied with dainty\r\nmorsels such as they loved, in the form of secret marriages. It was\r\nthe heyday of the Keith marriages at Mayfair Chapel, and at the Fleet.\r\nTit-bits from the gaming-tables were told and passed from one another,\r\nuntil Mrs. Montagu, disgusted with the scandal in these meetings and\r\nthe gambling that went on at parties, made a new departure in Society.\r\n\r\nShe was resolved to institute _réunions_ where conversion and\r\nliterature should entertain, and cards and gambling should never be\r\nseen. The result was that quite a new intellectual element appeared\r\nin Society. She brought such minds into contact as Mrs. Vesey, Mrs.\r\nThrale, Mrs. Barbauld, Hannah More, Lucy Aikin, Fanny Burney, Jane\r\nAusten, the beautiful Duchess of Devonshire, Johnson, Pulteney, Earl of\r\nBath, the first Lord Lyttelton, Horace Walpole, Dr. Burney, Garrick,\r\nand Reynolds, and the force of such gatherings was bound to influence\r\nboth men and women.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARIA, COUNTESS OF COVENTRY, née GUNNING.]\r\n\r\nIn _Jane Austen and Her Times_ (G. E. Mitton), a delightful volume\r\nrecently published, there is an interesting picture of the habits of\r\nthe day:\r\n\r\n“The epoch was one of change and enlargement in other than geographical\r\ndirections. In the thirty years before Jane Austen’s birth an immense\r\nimprovement had taken place in the position of women. Mrs. Montagu, in\r\n1750, had made bold strokes for the freedom and recognition of her sex.\r\nThe epithet ‘blue stocking,’ which has survived with such extraordinary\r\ntenacity, was at first given, not to the clever women who attended\r\nMrs. Montagu’s informal receptions, but to her men friends, who were\r\nallowed to come in the grey or blue worsted stockings of daily life,\r\ninstead of the black silk considered _de rigueur_ for parties. Up to\r\nthis time, personal appearance and cards had been the sole resources\r\nfor a leisured dame of the upper classes, and the language of gallantry\r\nwas the only one considered fitting for her to hear. By Mrs. Montagu’s\r\nefforts it was gradually recognised that a woman might not only have\r\nsense herself, but might prefer it should be spoken to her; and that\r\nbecause the minds of women had long been uncultivated they were not\r\non that account unworthy of cultivation. Hannah More describes Mrs.\r\nMontagu as ‘not only the finest genius, but the finest lady I ever saw\r\n... her form (for she has no body) is delicate even to fragility; her\r\ncountenance the most animated in the world; the sprightly vivacity of\r\nfifteen, with the judgment and experience of a Nestor.’”\r\n\r\nIt is amusing to find that the struggles of a century and a half ago\r\nare still unsolved to-day, half the pleasure of visiting being knocked\r\non the head by the uncertainty of the rightful proportion of the tips\r\nto follow. Jane Austen herself alludes to her difficulties:\r\n\r\n“I am in great distress whether I shall give Richis half a guinea or\r\nonly five shillings when I go away.”\r\n\r\nIn a letter to the _Times_ in 1795, the vexed subject of tips is\r\ndiscussed:\r\n\r\n“If a man who has a horse puts up at an Inn, besides the usual bill\r\nhe must at least give 1s. to the waiter, 6d. to chambermaid, 6d. to\r\nostler, and 6d. to jack-boot. At breakfast you must give at least 6d.\r\nto waiter and hostler. If the traveller only puts up for refreshment,\r\nbesides paying for his horses, he must give 3d. to hostler; at dinner,\r\n6d. to waiter and 3d to hostler; at tea, 6d. between them, etc.”\r\n\r\nJane Austen herself came late enough for the old days of rigid severity\r\ntowards children to be past. She says: “No longer were mere babies\r\ntaken to see executions and whipped on their return to enforce the\r\nexample they had beheld.”\r\n\r\nLondoners still flocked to the west on Sundays in their best attire,\r\nand on one occasion, in 1759, Lady Coventry was mobbed in Hyde Park.\r\nThe King, hearing of it, ordered that a guard of twelve sergeants\r\nshould disperse in the Park on the following Sunday, and that a\r\nreinforcement of a sergeant and twelve men should be ready in case of\r\nneed. This Lady Coventry knew, of course, and she went to the Park the\r\nfollowing Sunday, immediately pretended to be frightened, summoned\r\nthe guard, and walked about for some time with the twelve sergeants\r\nin front of her, her husband and Lord Pembroke beside her, and the\r\nsergeant and twelve men behind her.\r\n\r\n“It is at present the talk of the whole town,” says the Hon. J. West\r\nin a letter to a friend.\r\n\r\nIt was this same Lady Coventry who, when conversing with George II.,\r\none day remarked: “The only sight I am eager to see is a coronation.”\r\n\r\nThe old King laughed heartily, and repeated it as a good story. She did\r\nnot realise her wish, because she died a few days before His Majesty.\r\n\r\nThat gay stream of fashion on the south side was a wondrous sight,\r\nand yet Hyde Park had a vast extent of quiet bosky acres, where old\r\nladies took their favourite lap-dogs for a run, as Mrs. Thrale speaks\r\nof doing when she lived in Hanover Square. At Hyde Park Corner, where\r\na woman named Allen had sold apples and other refreshments from a\r\nsmall portable stall, was erected an ugly little building by special\r\npermission of the King, who recognised in the woman’s husband a\r\nsoldier who had fought under him at Dettingen—the last battle in which\r\na King of England ever took part. This land was afterwards sold by\r\nAllen’s descendants to Apsley, Lord Bathurst, who built Apsley House,\r\nafterwards the home of the famous Duke of Wellington. George II. also\r\nrewarded a pilot who had saved his life on one of his journeys to\r\nHanover by allowing him to “vend victuals” in Hyde Park—kindly deeds\r\nwhich soften many ugly lights in his character.\r\n\r\nIt was just after the death of this monarch that the Park played its\r\npart in the romance of his grandson, George III. The story of the love\r\nand admiration of the young King for the beautiful Lady Sarah Lennox\r\n(daughter of the Duke of Richmond) is well known. Lady Sarah loved Lord\r\nNewbattle, and he was probably the cause of her coolness to George\r\nIII. When she was staying with her aunt at Holland House a meeting was\r\narranged in Hyde Park between the lovers by Lord Newbattle’s sister,\r\nLady George Lennox, and it was there decided that he should at once ask\r\nhis father’s consent to the marriage. Lord Ancrum, however, would not\r\ngive permission, and there the matter ended.\r\n\r\nBut when Cupid walks in high places, Intrigue is busy dogging his\r\nfootsteps. And in this case Lord Bute in some way heard of the\r\nprojected meeting in the Park, and not only informed the Royal suitor,\r\nbut contrived for him to be a witness of it, and thus reconciled him to\r\nhis marriage with Charlotte of Mecklenburg.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM PITT, EARL OF CHATHAM.]\r\n\r\nAfter his union with that lady, George III. bought Buckingham House\r\nfrom the Duke of Buckingham, and called it “The Queen’s House.” The\r\nmansion was a red brick building, and was pulled down in George IV.’s\r\nreign, when the present palace was erected. Queen Charlotte cleared\r\nthe Court of immorality, but the Royal couple led too secluded a life\r\nto influence a wide circle. Society voted Court life insufferably dull\r\nand prosaic. When in London, it was the King’s habit to ride or drive\r\ndaily in Hyde Park. He used a chariot and four when driving, but his\r\nfavourite amusement was to trot off for an early morning ride free of\r\nceremony.\r\n\r\nHomely as the King appeared on these occasions, there was a still more\r\nhomely figure to be seen in Hyde Park, and yet on all sides people\r\ntendered him homage more spontaneously and more whole-heartedly than to\r\ntheir monarch. This was William Pitt, Earl of Chatham, ambling along on\r\nhis little Welsh pony. He loved the Park, and went there day by day,\r\nand he it was who first pleaded for the “open spaces” of London.\r\n\r\nIn the year of George III.’s accession, Society was entranced and\r\nhorrified by the tragedy which brought Earl Ferrers to the scaffold.\r\nAs this was largely a social event it may not be out of place to\r\ndescribe it here, apart from the story of those of meaner birth who\r\nended their days at Tyburn. Earl Ferrers was a man of such violent and\r\nuncontrollable temper that his wife and children had left him, and the\r\nCourts had appointed a receiver for his property. The choice had fallen\r\non an old servant of the family named Johnson, the land-steward, on the\r\nrecommendation of Lord Ferrers himself, who doubtless expected to find\r\nin him a pliable tool.\r\n\r\nThe murder took place on a Sunday afternoon. Earl Ferrers sent for\r\nJohnson, who was an old man, to come to his room, and meantime had\r\ndespatched the servants of the household on various duties so that none\r\nshould be within earshot. After some minutes of quiet conversation he\r\nproduced a paper, and demanded of Johnson that he should sign it. The\r\nsteward refused.\r\n\r\nEarl Ferrers walked to the door, which he locked, and going to a table\r\ntook up a loaded pistol. He then ordered Johnson to kneel. The old\r\nman dropped on one knee. The earl insisted that he should fall on\r\nboth knees. As soon as he had adopted this posture Earl Ferrers shot\r\nhim through the body. He then loaded the pistol again, as if to fire a\r\nsecond shot, but suddenly turned from his purpose, and, unlocking the\r\ndoor, called a servant.\r\n\r\nWhen assistance arrived Earl Ferrers was quite calm and collected. He\r\nhad lifted his victim, who had fallen on the floor mortally wounded,\r\ninto a chair, and was doing his utmost to stay the flow of blood. The\r\nearl directed that a surgeon should be hastily summoned, and meantime\r\nhimself remained tending the dying man. He seems, in fact, to have done\r\neverything that was possible. Johnson survived for nine hours, and told\r\nthe story.\r\n\r\nFerrers was brought up to London, “dressed as a jockey” driving in his\r\nown coach and six. Horace Walpole wrote: “Lord Ferrers is in the Tower;\r\nso you see the good-natured people of England will not want their\r\nfavourite amusement, executions.” (See Illustration, page 1).\r\n\r\n“Their favourite amusement, executions,” means much from a man\r\nlike Horace Walpole. He was no newspaper-sensation writer, yet he\r\ndeliberately noted the fact that the favourite amusement of London was\r\nto assist at a public execution. Thank Heaven we are less depraved\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nLord Ferrers pleaded lunacy in his trial before the House of Lords,\r\nbut was condemned, and then craved permission for his sentence to be\r\ncarried out in the Tower. This was not granted; the only concession\r\nmade being that he should be hanged by a silken rope. He dated his\r\ntroubles from his marriage, and therefore dressed himself in his\r\nwedding clothes, “a white suit, richly embroidered in silver”—“as good\r\nan occasion,” he observed, “as that for which they were made.” He\r\nrefused to go to Tyburn in the cart.\r\n\r\nWalpole’s description, written two days after the execution, reveals\r\nthe hold these scenes had on London Society.\r\n\r\n“He set out from the Tower at nine, amidst crowds, thousands. First\r\nwent a string of constables; then one of the sheriffs in his chariot\r\nand six, the horses dressed with ribbons; next Lord Ferrers in his own\r\nlandau and six, his coachman crying all the way; guards on each side;\r\nthe other sheriff’s chariot followed empty, with a mourning coach and\r\nsix, a hearse, and the Horse Guards. Observe that the empty chariot was\r\nthat of the other Sheriff, who was in the coach with the prisoner, and\r\nwho was Vaillant, the French bookseller in the Strand.... How will you\r\ndecipher all these strange circumstances to Florentines? A bookseller\r\nin robes and in mourning, sitting as a magistrate by the side of an\r\nearl, and in the evening everybody going to Vaillant’s shop to hear the\r\nparticulars....\r\n\r\n... The sheriffs fell to eating and drinking on the scaffold, and\r\nhelped up one of their friends to drink with them, as he was still\r\nhanging, which he did for above an hour, and then was conveyed back\r\nwith the same pomp to Surgeon’s Hall to be dissected. The executioners\r\nfought for the rope—a silken one—and the man who lost it cried. The\r\nmob tore off the black cloth as relics; but the universal crowd behaved\r\nwith great decency and admiration, as well they might; for sure no exit\r\nwas ever made with more sensible resolution and with less ostentation.”\r\n\r\nThat journey, which lasted two hours, on account of the mob, must\r\nhave been a trying ordeal. This was the first execution in which the\r\nfalling trap was used, and Ferrers is himself supposed to have been its\r\noriginator.\r\n\r\nEarly in George III.’s reign some severe winters occurred, and a\r\ntremendous frost prevailed for weeks. Sleighs glided merrily in Hyde\r\nPark, and contests and wagers were carried out on the Serpentine. In\r\nfact, the Park was about this time at its gayest, for in the following\r\nautumn the King of Denmark and two Princes of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha visited\r\nEngland, when one of the items in the programme of amusement was the\r\nshooting of a certain buck in the Park enclosures. The sport would have\r\nmade those old kingly patrons of the chase thrill with horror, for it\r\ntook the whole evening and many shots ere that stately stag was brought\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nThe princes added much to the gaiety of the daily gatherings in Hyde\r\nPark, where Society was assuming a more important phase than ever.\r\n\r\nBy this time the beaux of a quarter of a century before were superseded\r\nby the Bucks and Macaronis. The Macaronis were the Society men, or fops\r\nof the day. It was the thing for Society to make much of them, as we\r\nsee to-day Society ladies making a fuss and dressing up toy dogs and\r\npoodles. The long curled wigs of the Macaronis, tied with streaming\r\nribbons, eye-glasses, patches, paint, velvets, costly canes with gold\r\nand silver tassels, made great show without, but little sense was\r\nrevealed under the paint, the powder, and the patches.\r\n\r\nIn these days of suffragettes women imitate and strive for equal\r\nprivileges with men. In 1773 the position was apparently reversed, for\r\nthe _Westminster Gazette_ of that date says: “The men imitate the women\r\nin almost everything, perfumes, paint, and effeminate baubles engross\r\nmost of their time, and learning is now looked on as an unworthy\r\nattainment.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nEARLY CHRONICLES OF TYBURN\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the fashionable folk who roll by in their carriages from the\r\nWest-end to Hyde Park, and enter by the gates at Marble Arch to join\r\nthe gay throng, so full of life and animation; of all the hurrying\r\npopulace who pass in omnibuses or on foot towards Bayswater, or turn\r\nthe sharp corner where the traffic flows in an unceasing stream up the\r\nEdgware Road,—how many, I wonder, ever pause at the three cross roads\r\nto give a moment’s thought to the fact that this was Tyburn?\r\n\r\nHow many among them are even aware of the fact?\r\n\r\nThis is the blackest spot in all the wide extent of the Metropolis,—the\r\nmost tragic, if not the most historical, spot in all England. Memories\r\nof the illustrious dead,—sacrificed to the ambitions, jealousies, and\r\nvindictive hatred of monarchs in a ruder age, hallow that quiet space\r\non Tower Hill where the heads of so many statesmen and warriors, nobles\r\nand bishops, rolled in the sawdust. That is marked off by a little\r\nsquare of bricks surrounded by railed-in gardens—a pleasant patch of\r\ngreen amid the tall warehouses which crowd upon it on all sides, save\r\nwhere the gaunt grey walls of the fortress rise.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Marble Arch (formerly Tyburn) at three o’clock in\r\nthe morning.]\r\n\r\nThe execution ground within the Tower, beneath the shadow of the little\r\nchurch of St. Peter-in-Chains, calls to mind only some of the most\r\nsympathetic names in history; gentle Anne Boleyn, the heroic Countess\r\nof Salisbury, and the ill-fated Lady Jane Grey.\r\n\r\nTyburn has other associations. Martyrs have perished here, bigots\r\nhave suffered, Society has found its victims, and punishment has been\r\ndealt out for villainy and crime in its most unattractive forms. Such\r\nsensational fame as the place may claim rests upon the exploits and\r\nend of Jack Sheppard, Jonathan Wild, “Sixteen-Stringed Jack,” and the\r\nghastly indignities heaped by Charles II. upon the bodies of Cromwell\r\nand the regicides.\r\n\r\nFew will recognise the old “Tyburn Road” in modern Oxford Street,\r\nwith its huge drapery and furniture emporiums, and the attractions\r\nwhich bring so large a part of the populace to shop there. A century\r\nand a half ago this was a country road, along which the two-wheeled,\r\nspringless carts passed from Newgate with their escorts of sheriffs,\r\nofficers, and marshalmen conveying condemned men to execution.\r\n\r\nWhat can be farther from the sordid associations of “Tyburn Lane” than\r\nPark Lane of to-day, in all its wealth and luxury? Along here the\r\ncrowds surged in thousands going to witness the turning off at Tyburn’s\r\n“Triple Tree” of many a handsome, dashing gentleman of the road, a\r\ndarling of the populace.\r\n\r\nOne will find these old names marked in maps of a century ago, but\r\nmay search a London Directory of to-day in vain for the name of any\r\nstreet, passage, or alley of which Tyburn formed a part.\r\n\r\nThe town has grown over the place, and Tyburnia, as the district used\r\nto be called, has been altered out of recognition. Possibly a few of\r\nthe old elms along the course of the West-bourne may still rock in\r\nthe winds which blow across Hyde Park. The ditch in one part has been\r\ntransformed into the Serpentine, elsewhere it has been filled and the\r\nground levelled. The Ty-bourne, if it flows at all, flows underground\r\nthrough the sewers. Tyburn turnpike, where tolls were taken on entering\r\nLondon, disappeared in the early part of the nineteenth century, and\r\nits site is marked by the zero milestone of London.\r\n\r\nThe famous hanging-place has nothing left by which it can be recognised.\r\n\r\nIt is a common idea that hanging as a means of punishment is\r\ncomparatively modern. People have even placed its origin within our own\r\nhistoric times. Instead, it is very old indeed, dating back certainly\r\nto the Mosaic Law, which was thus delivered by Moses to the Israelites\r\n(Deut. xxi. 22):\r\n\r\n“And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be put to\r\ndeath, and thou hang him on a tree; his body shall not remain all night\r\nupon the tree, but thou shalt surely bury him the same day; for he that\r\nis hanged is accursed of God; that thou defile not the land which the\r\nLord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.”\r\n\r\nThe earliest record of the punishment being actually carried out is\r\nfound in the Book of Numbers (xxv.), on the occasion of the Israelites\r\nhaving sacrificed to the gods of the Moabites at Baal-peor, when Moses\r\nreceived and put into effect the Divine command to hang the leaders in\r\nthe acts of idolatry.\r\n\r\nLater, when a famine was raging in the land of Israel, David handed\r\nover to the Gibeonites seven of the sons of Saul, whom they hanged.\r\n\r\nAnother instance of punishment by hanging is found in the Book\r\nof Esther (ix.), when King Ahasuerus condemned the ambitious and\r\nunprincipled Haman to be hanged on the gallows he had prepared for the\r\nJew Mordecai; and at the request of Queen Esther the same punishment\r\nwas meted out to his ten sons.\r\n\r\nHanging was regulated by law by Henry I., but the earliest recorded\r\nuse of the rope in England can be traced to the days of Henry II. This\r\nquestionable distinction belongs to the town of Malden, which, in the\r\nyear 1167, “was amerced three marks for having hanged a robber without\r\nsuch view,” that is to say, the approval of the King’s Sergeant.\r\n\r\nEight years later, Andrew Bucquinte, a thief, who had carried out\r\nnumerous robberies in the City of London, was sentenced to be hanged,\r\n“which was done, and the Citie became more quiet”; while the later\r\nchroniclers give full details, which had been passed on to them, of the\r\ndeath in 1196 of William FitzOsbert, or “Longbeard.” Matthew Paris,\r\nStow, and Hollinshed all name “the Elms” as the place of hanging. Roger\r\nde Wendover records that Longbeard was drawn to the gallows “near\r\nTyburn,” and there hanged with nine of his followers.\r\n\r\nThis would seem to be the first authentic account of an execution\r\nby hanging at Tyburn, though, in fact, it is very doubtful—Roger de\r\nWendover notwithstanding—if Longbeard met his fate at Tyburn. “The\r\nElms” was the name given to the hanging-place at Smithfield long before\r\nthe law’s last penalty was demanded at Tyburn, and at the “Elms, at\r\nSmithfield,” a century after Longbeard’s death, William Wallace was\r\nhanged and quartered in 1305.\r\n\r\nThe name seems to have been carried to Tyburn when hangings were\r\ntransferred there, and for a time the two execution-grounds flourished\r\nsimultaneously.\r\n\r\nLongbeard was the first of a line of romantic impostors who attracted\r\nadmirers by hundreds, and ended their days under the gallows. He\r\nrepresented to Richard I. that the wealthy citizens of London were\r\noppressing the poor; he preached to the masses, proclaiming that he\r\nwas their saviour, and that to him they must look for deliverance.\r\nRichard listened to his story. This so encouraged him that he “had\r\ngotten two and fiftie thousand persons readie to have taken his\r\npart,” and all rich people went in fear of their lives. Summoned to\r\nappear before the Archbishop of Canterbury for inciting to rebellion,\r\nLongbeard was accompanied by so many followers that the Prelate dared\r\nnot deliver sentence. He then retired, with his paramour, to the Tower\r\nof St. Mary-le-Bow, which he had previously provisioned and fortified.\r\nIgnoring all the Archbishop’s commands to appear, it was only when the\r\nchurch had been assaulted and set on fire that, driven out by smoke and\r\nflames, he surrendered. He was dragged to the Tower, and thence to the\r\nfinal scene.\r\n\r\nLongbeard was a man of evil life, but the poor looked upon him as\r\na martyr, and, Stow says, “pared away the earth that was be-bled\r\n(sprinkled) with his blood, and kept the same as holy reliques to heale\r\nsicknesse.” It would therefore appear that he was not only hanged, but\r\ndrawn and quartered as well.\r\n\r\nThis custom of carrying away trophies from the gibbet was a\r\nsuperstition, and Brand, in his edition of Bourne’s _Antiquitates\r\nVulgares_, writes:\r\n\r\n“Chips of gallows and Places of Execution are used for Amulets against\r\nAgues. I saw lately some Saw-dust, on which Blood was absorbed, taken\r\nfor some such purpose from off the Scaffold on the beheading of one of\r\nthe rebel lords, 1746.”\r\n\r\nPossibly the added information that the crowd stole “the gibbet” is a\r\nmisconception by the chronicler to whom the tradition is handed down.\r\nThe passage is not without difficulty. So early in our history “Tyburn”\r\nmeant merely the Ty-bourne, or brook, where it flowed from Hampstead\r\ntowards the Thames, not necessarily the common place of execution\r\nwhich afterwards took to itself the distinctive name of Tyburn. What\r\nthe “Elms” represented has never, so far as can be gathered, been\r\nsatisfactorily cleared up. It is reasonably supposed that rows of trees\r\nstood on the banks of the burn where it passed through the forest and\r\nmarshes, and probably their branches afforded convenient means for\r\nhanging prisoners.\r\n\r\nWith so much growing timber about, it would have been useless expense\r\nand labour to bring carpenters to construct a gallows, and to people of\r\nthe thirteenth century a quite unnecessary refinement. “The Elms” near\r\nTyburn was the scene of many executions after that of Longbeard. If, in\r\nfact, the hanging-place at “the Elms” was on trees growing beside the\r\nbourne, then, owing to its course, the execution-ground must have been\r\nsome few hundred yards farther eastward than the Tyburn of later days.\r\n\r\nKing John not only hanged some Welsh rebels at Nottingham in 1212, but\r\nnine years later Constantine Fitz-Arnulph and two confederates were\r\nhanged for raising a tumult at Westminster, so by this time hanging\r\nas a method of capital punishment had become an accepted institution.\r\nThe records tell of twelve pirates hanged in Hampshire in Henry III.’s\r\nreign, and of eighteen Lincoln Jews suffering the same fate a few years\r\nlater. In London also great strife between the goldsmiths and tailors\r\nled to the imprisonment of many rioters, thirteen of whom were hanged\r\nfor the trouble they had caused in the City.\r\n\r\nAs if London had not enough horrors of its own, the custom was\r\nestablished in the reign of Edward I. of bringing offenders from the\r\nprovinces to the capital for execution, and taking wrongdoers of\r\nLondon to certain towns in the country for the same purpose. Jews at\r\nNorthampton being accused of having crucified a Christian boy on Good\r\nFriday, many “Jewes at London after Easter were drawne at horse tailes\r\nand hanged”; and such wholesale punishments of that persecuted tribe\r\nwere of frequent occurrence.\r\n\r\nAlthough “the Elms” is not actually mentioned, the accounts related\r\nof Rice ap Meredith, a rebel, and of Gilbert Middleton, in 1316, lead\r\nto the conclusion that they ended their days at “the Elms”; they were\r\ndrawn “through the streets of the citie to the gallowes.” Middleton, a\r\nfourteenth-century “Dick Turpin,” was brought from the north to London,\r\nand hanged in the presence of two cardinals whom he had robbed. These\r\nChurch dignitaries had come to England with the view of making a double\r\npeace, namely, between Edward II. and Thomas, Duke of Lancaster, and\r\nbetween England and Scotland. But after Middleton had attacked and\r\nrobbed them in the north, they were so disgusted they never visited\r\nScotland at all. These were the early days of the self-assertion of the\r\npopulace—about which we now hear so much under the banner of Socialism.\r\n\r\nRichard Davey, in his _Pageant of London_, writing of this time, says:\r\n\r\n“The evolution of slavery into serfdom, and of serfdom into\r\nvassalage—one of the greatest efforts towards true progress effected\r\nin this age—very rapidly brought about the creation of what we might\r\ndescribe as a lower class, whose voice was soon to be heard clamouring\r\nfor its share in direct or indirect administration. Hence the\r\nincreasing influence of universities, guilds, and corporations.”\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed from this, however, that education took any\r\nimportant turn, for the middle-class man and woman could neither\r\nwrite nor read until the money derived from the destruction of the\r\nmonasteries was utilised for founding Grammar Schools. That is why\r\nit is so difficult to glean far-away facts when information and\r\nchronicling were in the hands of so few.\r\n\r\nBy the time Wat Tyler’s rebellion had been put down, and ruthlessly\r\npunished, London appears to have possessed a permanent gallows. Victims\r\nnumbered by hundreds, who had participated in the rising, dangled on\r\ntrees and gibbets all over the counties of Middlesex, Essex, and Kent,\r\nand the excessive use of the hangman’s rope no doubt made some such\r\nstructure a necessity. “The Elms” drops out of notice. Baker, relating\r\nin his _Chronicle_ the arraignment of Roger Mortimer half a century\r\nearlier for encompassing the death of Edward II., and his subsequent\r\nexecution, speaks of him as being “hanged on the common gallows at\r\nthe Elms, now called Tyburn, where his body remained two days as an\r\nopprobrious spectacle for all beholders.”\r\n\r\nThis is but a small detail, but it is in such strokes of the pen that\r\nwe learn much of the general state of things in past ages, and that\r\nword “Common” depicts a gallows in frequent use. It was after this\r\nthat the place of execution seems to have been moved to Tyburn Road,\r\nand perhaps it was the erection of the permanent gallows at this time,\r\nthat led Fuller to speak of the gibbet having been placed there as “an\r\ninstrument of torture and punishment for the Lollards” (the followers\r\nof John Wyclif), and to quaintly write:\r\n\r\n“Tieburne some will so have it called, from Tie and Burne, because the\r\npoor Lollards, for whom this instrument (of cruelty to them, though of\r\nJustice to Malefactors) was first set up, had their necks tied to the\r\nBeame, and their lower parts burnt in the fire.”\r\n\r\nThe worthy Fuller refers to the Act “De Heretico Comburendo,” for,\r\nnot content with mere death, it had been thought necessary to invent\r\nanother mode of punishment for persecuting the Lollards, and this Act\r\nauthorised the burning of heretics in a high public place.\r\n\r\nAs for the derivation here attempted, it seems rather a quaint conceit\r\nby Fuller than a serious explanation of the origin of a word which for\r\nso many centuries bore a notorious meaning. The Bourne flowed along\r\nits course from time immemorial; as we know, it was called Tiburne, or\r\nTyburn, in the earliest references extant, and it is much more likely\r\nthat the execution-ground took its name from the Bourne, than that the\r\nbrook itself owes its distinctive title to a particular form of death\r\npractised so late as the time of the Lollards.\r\n\r\nThe executions of Nicholas Brembre and Judge Tresillian in 1388 are\r\nsupposed to have been the first recorded deaths at this new Tyburn.\r\nThese men had been impeached for high treason. Brembre had been four\r\ntimes Lord Mayor of London. The charge against him was that he had\r\n“intended to slay some thousands of the citizens, to alter the name\r\nof London to that of ‘New Troy,’ and to have himself created Duke\r\nthereof.” So the gentleman was not without ambitions.\r\n\r\nRoger Bolingbroke, who met his death for alleged necromancy, was\r\nanother of the early victims of Tyburn. The whole charge arose out of\r\nthe bitter jealousy existing between Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, son\r\nof Henry IV., and Cardinal Beaufort, Bishop of Winchester, the son of\r\nJohn of Gaunt and Catharine Swynford. On the death of Henry V. each\r\nvied with the other for the guardianship of the young King (who was\r\nbut nine months old when his father died) and the leadership of public\r\naffairs. Beaufort’s huge wealth secured him the support of the Church,\r\ninto whose coffers he poured large gifts, and finally Humphrey was\r\narrested and thrown into prison. Meantime Beaufort had devised that\r\ncharges of witchcraft should be brought against Gloucester’s chaplain,\r\nRoger Bolingbroke and his wife Eleanor Cobham, Duchess of Gloucester,\r\nrepresenting that she was exercising necromancy to encompass the death\r\nof Henry VI. and place her husband on the throne.\r\n\r\nStow tells us the story:\r\n\r\n“Roger Bolinbrooke a great Astronomer, with Thomas Southwell, a Chanon\r\nof Saynt Stephen’s Chapell at Westminster, were taken as Conspiratours\r\nof the King’s death, for it was said, that the same Roger shoulde\r\nlabour to consume the King’s person by way of Necromancie, and the said\r\nThomas should say Masses in the Lodge of Hornesey park beside London,\r\nvpon certain instruments, with the which the said Roger should use the\r\ncraft of necromancies, against the faith, and was assenting to the\r\nsaid Roger in all his works. And the 5 and twentieth day of July being\r\nSunday, Roger Bolinbrooke, with all his instruments of necromancie,\r\nthat is to say a chayre paynted herein he was wont to sit, vppon the\r\n4 corners of which chayre stood foure swords, and vppon every sword\r\nan image of copper hanging with many other instruments. Hee stoode\r\non a high scaffolde in Paules Churchyard, before yᵉ crosse, holding\r\na sword in his right hand and a scepter in his left, arrayed in a\r\nmarvellous attire, and after the Sermon was ended by Maister Low Byshop\r\nof Rochester, he abjureth all articles belonging to the crafte of\r\nnecromancie of missowning to the faith, in presence of the Archbishop\r\nof Canterbury, the Cardinall of Winchester, the byshop of London,\r\nSalisbury and many other.”\r\n\r\nEleanor Cobham, Duchess of Gloucester, was brought before Chicheley,\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury, and Cardinal Beaufort, Bishop of Winchester,\r\nand others, in St. Stephen’s Chapel at Westminster. Bolingbroke was\r\nproduced as a witness against her, and accused her of inciting him to\r\npractise necromancy. Finally a Commission was appointed to inquire\r\ninto the various witchcrafts and treasons against the King’s person,\r\nand Bolingbroke and Southwell as principals, and Eleanor Cobham as\r\nan accessory, were indicted for treason. Bolingbroke was condemned\r\nto death and was taken to Tyburn, where he was hanged, drawn, and\r\nquartered, denying the crime of treason, but crying for God’s mercy for\r\nhaving presumed too far in his cunning.\r\n\r\nNor did Beaufort’s vengeance end here. Humphrey of Gloucester was\r\nthrown into prison, where he languished and died in 1446—murdered, some\r\nwriters allege, by Beaufort. In the following year five of his most\r\nnoted sympathisers were arrested and put in the Tower, from whence they\r\nwere “drawn to Tiborne, hanged, let down quick, stripped, marked with\r\na knife to be quartered.” At that juncture the Duke of Suffolk arrived\r\nwith a pardon, which did not, however, deprive the hangman of his\r\nperquisites. Says Stow: “Yᵉ yeomen of yᵉ gallows had their livelode,\r\nand the hangmen their clothes and wearing apparel.” He adds that the\r\npardon was secured by the prayers of “Master Gilbert Worthington, the\r\nparson of St. Andrewes in Holborn.”\r\n\r\nA quiet hanging was little to the taste of either the dispensers of\r\njustice or of vengeance, or of the crowds that gathered at executions\r\nin those rude days, or, indeed, in the days of the Tudors, or even of\r\nCharles II. Common malefactors were swung upon a gibbet and left there,\r\nno more trouble was bestowed upon them; but for the plotter against\r\nthe State, the process of death was more elaborate. References to the\r\nvictims being “hanged, drawne, and quartered” abound.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible within the limits of decency to describe in detail the\r\nrevolting tortures and mutilations practised upon the poor wretches\r\nwhom ill-fortune brought to Tyburn. What the sentence implied can\r\nbe found in the State Trial of the Duke of Buckingham, where it was\r\ndelivered in all its unabashed nakedness by the Earl of Norfolk, though\r\nHenry VIII. substituted decapitation. What it meant in actual practice\r\nmay be judged from the records of the punishment of those concerned in\r\nthe Babington Plot against Queen Elizabeth. Fifteen men were condemned\r\nto die, and after a day and a half had been spent on the ghastly work,\r\nleaving it still incomplete, the Queen, disgusted with the sickening\r\nbusiness, bade the executioners “despatch with haste” the remaining\r\nvictims, remitting the last abominations.\r\n\r\nIt was the earliest custom to tie the wretched victim by the heels,\r\nattach him by a rope to a horse’s tail, and thus drag him from gaol to\r\nthe place of execution. Arrived at his destination, jeered and howled\r\nat all the way, and sorely bruised as he jolted over the rough roads to\r\nhis death, he was placed on the gibbet. The rope, after much fumbling,\r\nwas adjusted mid the yells of the spectators, and then the prisoner\r\nwas hoisted on high by the executioner and his assistant, until slow\r\nsuffocation ended his misery.\r\n\r\nLater, for humanity’s sake, a rough hurdle was utilised, to which the\r\ncondemned man was bound, and on this he was dragged to the gallows. Not\r\nuntil Stuart times was the malefactor’s springless cart introduced.\r\n\r\nIn only too many cases, however, the dread sentence of “hanged, drawn,\r\nand quartered” was carried out with all its attendant horrors. The\r\ncondemned wretch, after he had been dangled from the gallows on a\r\nshort rope for a considerable time, and undergone all the horrors of\r\ndeath by suffocation without its merciful release, was cut down still\r\nalive. Then he was stripped, his clothes being the executioner’s\r\nperquisite, and with his knife that functionary marked off the lines\r\nhe would follow in carrying out the quartering. The victim was then\r\ndisembowelled, the entrails being thrown on a fire and burnt before his\r\ndying eyes. The head was decapitated. Finally, the mutilated corpse was\r\ndivided into four pieces, which were sometimes salted or par-boiled,\r\nand, with the head, made five ghastly evidences of the consequences\r\nthat would befall those who offended the higher powers. These “bits”\r\nwere sent for exhibition in five different localities where it was\r\nsupposed that such warning would be most beneficial.\r\n\r\nAnything more horrible cannot be imagined. And yet a crowd always\r\nassembled to witness the scene. Men, women, and children scrambled for\r\na front view, and the grand ladies and smart gentlemen of comparatively\r\nrefined times did not appear to consider it degrading to watch a person\r\nhanged by the neck until he was dead. In fact, the morbid love of such\r\nhorrors pursued us till a much later date, for murderers were publicly\r\nhanged outside Newgate, on a busy thoroughfare of the City of London,\r\nas recently as 1866.\r\n\r\nPerkin Warbeck—“that little cockatrice of a king,” as Bacon calls\r\nhim—was one of the mediæval victims who met his end at Tyburn in 1499.\r\nWith him went to their death the servants who were found conniving at\r\nhis escape from the Tower. No character in the arena of history at that\r\nperiod has more glamour of romance about it than that of Warbeck. Even\r\nthe most unbiassed writers seem to waver as to whether he was really\r\nthe Duke of York or an impostor, so readily did he tell the tale of\r\nhow he, as the little prince, had escaped from the Tower, and now as a\r\ngrown man came to claim his heritage. In his imprisonment he had twice\r\nmade bids for freedom, been captured, and made to read a confession—on\r\nthe second occasion a public avowal, standing in Cheapside—after which\r\nhe was again confined in the Tower.\r\n\r\nIt has been alleged by some historians that this was a mere scheme of\r\nHenry VII. to place him in contact with the Earl of Warwick, the son\r\nof George, Duke of Clarence, and heir of the House of York, who had\r\nbeen kept a prisoner in the Tower until he was practically bordering\r\non imbecility. The presence of this man would be a greater temptation\r\nto Warbeck to make another attempt to gain his freedom, and probably\r\nit would give the King an opportunity to rid himself of both these\r\nclaimants of Royal descent. The Earl of Warwick was beheaded on Tower\r\nHill, and Warbeck was hanged at Tyburn. For his end we can again refer\r\nto Stow:\r\n\r\n“Perken Warbeke—being in holde, by great promises corrupted his\r\nkeepers, named Strangwais, Blewet, Astwood, and long Roger, servants\r\nto sir I. Digby, lieutenant of the Tower (as was affirmed) intended to\r\nhave slaine their Master, to have set Perken and the Earle of Warwick\r\nat large; which Earle of Warwick had been kept in prison within the\r\nTower (as yee have heard) from the first yeere of this king to this 15\r\nyeere out of all companie of men and sight of beasts, and therefore\r\ncould not of himselfe seeke his owne destruction, but by other he was\r\nbrought to his death, for being made privie of this enterprise devised\r\nby Perken and his complices, he assented thereunto: but this devise\r\nbeing revealed Perken and I. a Waters, sometime Maior of Corke in\r\nIreland, were arraigned and condemned at Westminster and on the 23 of\r\nNovember drawn to Tiborne, where Perken read his former confession as\r\nbefore he had done in Cheape, taking on his death the same to bee true,\r\nand so hee & Iohn a Water asked the King forgivenesse, and tooke their\r\ndeaths patiently. And shortly after Walter Blewt and Thomas Astwood\r\nwere hanged at Tyborne.”\r\n\r\nWhen Henry VIII. was King, Tyburn was yet more busy. The lesser victims\r\nof that monarch’s policy and ambition, for whom the axe and block\r\nwere considered too good, were sent out of the Tower to the loathsome\r\nprisons of the day, to meet an ignominious end under the gallows. A\r\nlong, sad procession they made, many priests among them, martyrs for\r\nthe Catholic faith.\r\n\r\nSome of the most pathetic figures were the prior and monks from the\r\nCharter House, whose execution is thus described in the _Contemporary\r\nSpanish Chronicle of Henry VIII._, edited by Martin Hume.\r\n\r\n“The monks of the Charter House refused to take the oath to Henry as\r\nhead of the Church (June 1535).\r\n\r\n“When the King heard of it he ordered that justice should be executed\r\nupon them, so they were taken two by two on hurdles and dragged to the\r\ngallows (at Tyburn), which is three miles from London.\r\n\r\n“The Prior went alone on a hurdle, and the holy friars confessed to\r\neach other as they went along, the Prior embracing the crucifix and\r\nsaying many prayers. When they were arrived at the gallows they took\r\none of the first and cast a rope about his neck, and the hangman asked\r\nhis pardon. Then all the others placed themselves so that they should\r\nsee the first die, the Prior exhorting in Latin and comforting him as\r\nhe was led up. The friar turned to the hangman and said, ‘Brother, do\r\nthy duty.’ The rope being placed on the gallows, the hangman whipped\r\nthe horse, and the friar remained hanging. Directly, before he was\r\nhalf-dead, they cut the rope and stripped him: then they ripped up his\r\nbelly, plucked out his bowels and his heart, and cast them into the\r\nfire that was burning there, and afterwards they cut off his head and\r\nquartered the body. The holy friars looked on at all this, praying\r\nthe whole time, and when the first execution was finished the Sheriff\r\nsaid to the other fathers: ‘Ye see what has become of your companion:\r\nyou had better repent and you will be forgiven.’ Altogether in one\r\nvoice, which was as if the Holy Ghost himself was speaking, they cried,\r\n‘Sheriff, we are only impatient to join our brother.’ Each one offered\r\nhimself as first for martyrdom, and they all died like the first.”\r\n\r\nThe English Chronicles record the Carthusian martyrdoms in this year\r\n1535 (20th April, five men; and 19th June, three men) at Tyburn, and\r\nthis note appears to refer to the second execution. The quarters\r\nwere seared with pitch and set up at the gates on London Bridge and\r\nbefore the Charter House. The Spaniard says that the quarters remained\r\nincorrupt.\r\n\r\nIn all the number there are few brighter names than those of the Earl\r\nof Kildare and his four kinsmen, whose capture, imprisonment, and death\r\n(1537) furnished a deplorable tale of Tudor treachery and vengeance.\r\nThe earl, who had been involved in one of the numerous rebellions in\r\nIreland, which were the chronic state of that unhappy country, had\r\nbeen promised pardon if he repaired to England. The story, so full of\r\npathos, and of the fear of death, brightened by the heroism of the\r\nyounger brother, cannot be better told than in Hollinshed’s quaint\r\nphrases:\r\n\r\n“And before his imprisonment was bruted, letters were posted into\r\nIreland streiatly commanding the deputie upon sight of them, to\r\napprehend Thomas Fitzgirald his uncles, and to see them with all speed\r\nconuenient shipt into England. Which the lord deputie did not slacke.\r\nFor having feasted three of the gentlemen at Kilmainan immediatelie\r\nafter their banket (as it is now and then seene that sweet meate will\r\nhave sowre sawce) he caused them to be manacled, and led as prisoners\r\nto the Castell of Dublin; and the other two were so roundlie snatcht\r\nup in villages hard by, as they no sooner felt their owne captivitie\r\nthan they had notice of their brethren’s calamitie. The next wind that\r\nserved into England, these five brethren were imbarked, to wit James\r\nFitzgirald, Walter Fitzgirald, Oliver Fitzgirald, John Fitzgirald,\r\nand Richard Fitzgirald. Three of these gentlemen, James, Walter, and\r\nRichard, were knowne to have crossed their nephue Thomas to their power\r\nin his rebellion and therefore were not occasioned to misdoubt anie\r\ndanger. But such as in thos days were enimies to the house, incensed\r\nthe King so sore against it, persuading him that he should never\r\nconquer Ireland, as long as anie Giraldine breathed in the countrie:\r\nas for making the pathwaie smooth, he was resolved to lop off as well\r\nthe good and sound grapes, as the wild and fruitlesse berries. Whereby\r\nappeareth how dangerous it is to be a rub, when a King is disposed to\r\nsweepe an alleie.\r\n\r\n“Thus were the five brethren sailing into England, among whom Richard\r\nFitzgerald being more bookish than the rest of his brethren, and\r\none that was much given to the studies of antiquitie, wailing his\r\ninward griefe, with outward mirth comforted them with cheerefulnesse\r\nof countenance, as well as persuading them that offended to repose\r\naffiance in God, and the King his mercie, and such as were not of that\r\nconspiracie to relie to their innocencie, which they should hold for a\r\nmore safe and strong barbican than any rampire of Castell of brasse.\r\nThus solacing the sillie mourners sometime with smiling, sometime\r\nwith singing, sometime with grave and pittie apophthegmes, he craved\r\nof the owner the name of the barke; who having answered, that it was\r\ncalled the Cow, the gentleman sore appalled thereat, said: ‘Now, good\r\nbrethren, I am in utter despaire of our returne to Ireland, for I beare\r\nin mind an old prophecie, that five earles, brethren, should be carried\r\nin a Cowes bellie to England, and from thense never to returne’.\r\n\r\n“Whereat the rest began afresh to howle and lament, which doubtlesse\r\nwas pitifull, to behold five valiant gentlemen, that durst meet in the\r\nfield five as sturdie champions as could be picked out in a realme,\r\nto be so suddenlie terrified with the bare name of a woodden cow, or\r\nto fear like lions a sillie cocke his combe, being moved (as commonlie\r\nthe whole countrie is) with a vaine and fabulous old wives’ dreame. But\r\nwhat blind prophesie soever he read, or heard of anie superstitious\r\nbeldame touching a cow his bellie, that which he foretold them was\r\nfound true. For Thomas Fitzgirald the third of Februarie, and these\r\nfive brethren his uncles were drawne, hanged, and quartered at Tiburne,\r\nwhich was incontinentlie bruted as well in England and Ireland, as in\r\nforen soyles.”\r\n\r\nIn the midst of his arrangements for divorce the vengeance of Henry\r\nVIII. fell upon a witless girl who was known as “The Holy Maid of\r\nKent.” She had become imbecile from frequent epileptic fits. Masters,\r\nthe vicar of Addington, and Dr. Bocking, a Canon of Canterbury, tutored\r\nher to predict, as it suited their own ends, that Henry VIII. would\r\nlose his kingdom and die a violent death if he cast aside Catherine of\r\nArragon, and married Anne Boleyn. The final scene of this diabolical\r\ninfluence of strength over weakness was that the girl and her abettors\r\nwere hanged and beheaded at Tyburn, her head being set on London\r\nBridge, and those of the men on the City gates.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LONDON BRIDGE (Showing heads displayed).\r\n\r\n_From a Print in Magdalene College, Cambridge._]\r\n\r\nWe have little idea of the tremendous religious antagonism of those\r\ndays, an antagonism which brought so many poor sufferers to the gibbet\r\nat Tyburn. Indeed, so determined were those in power to extirpate all\r\nremains of Roman Catholicism, that a search was actually instituted\r\nfrom house to house, and all rosaries and other objects savouring of\r\nRomanism were destroyed.\r\n\r\nThat a man was priest, open or disavowed, during that fierce struggle\r\nbetween Henry VIII. and the Church which he had overthrown and\r\ndespoiled, was sufficient to condemn him to suffer under Tyburn’s fatal\r\ntree:\r\n\r\n“The 8 of October last before passed I. Low, I. Adams, and Richard\r\nDibdale, being before condemned for treason, for being made Priests\r\nby authority of the Bishop of Rome, were drawne to Tyborne, and there\r\nhanged, bowelled, and quartered.\r\n\r\n“The 18 of Februarie, Harrington, a seminary priest, was drawne from\r\nNewgate to Tyborne, and there hanged, cut downe alive, struggled with\r\nthe hangman, but was bowelled and quartered.”\r\n\r\nElizabeth, too, found the terrors, which the very name of Tyburn\r\ninstilled into the minds of her subjects, useful in maintaining public\r\norder and punishing plotters against her personal welfare. The gibbet,\r\nindeed, became a corrector of manners.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the sixteenth century, after the closing of the\r\nmonasteries, the peasantry found it difficult to find work on the\r\ncountryside, and thus it was that they flocked to London in hundreds\r\nseeking employment, in exactly the same way that thousands of the poor\r\ndo to-day. The results, however, are different. In our times we house\r\nthem in workhouses, feed them in soup-kitchens, and allow them to sing\r\nin our roads, until they make life hideous. We encourage them in every\r\nway until the street loafer is a curse to London, and the want of\r\nlabourers in the country an unceasing cry.\r\n\r\nThis is our modern way of creating mendicity. Formerly they were not\r\nso foolish, though perhaps too severe. Any one caught begging, or\r\naimlessly wandering about, was seized, ordered to be whipped, and sold\r\nas a chattel.\r\n\r\nThus it was that hundreds of these poor creatures were shipped off to\r\nthe West Indies and the early American colonies. Travelling in those\r\ndays was not so luxurious as it is now, and many of them died on the\r\nway. Those who remained behind were even worse treated. They were often\r\nruthlessly beaten and continually starved; they were, in fact, brought\r\nto such dire distress that they were bought and sold as mere slaves.\r\n\r\nHow surprised the loafers, who bury their noses in mother earth and\r\nsleep by the hour on the green grass of Hyde Park, would be if such\r\ndrastic measures were applied to them; but surely some happy medium\r\nbetween the hanging of the sixteenth century and the encouragement of\r\nloafing of the twentieth might be found.\r\n\r\nPunishments were altogether more severe in those days, and even as\r\nlate as the end of the eighteenth century batches of men, women, and\r\nchildren were hanged at Tyburn for deeds which would hardly be punished\r\nnowadays, and, any way, would not be reproved by more than a day or two\r\nin prison. In fact, when the last century dawned, there were no less\r\nthan two hundred and twenty-three capital offences.\r\n\r\nEven soldiers and sailors, who are still noted for their jollities on\r\nlanding from distant climes, were marched to the scaffold in the “good\r\nold times.”\r\n\r\n“Sir John Norris and Sir Francis Drake, being returned, as ye have\r\nheard many of their Saylers, and souldiers, shortly after their landing\r\nfell sick, and died of a stanch bred amongst them on shippe board,\r\nother some of them so rudely behaved themselves about the countrey,\r\nabout the Court, and elsewhere, that many men misliked of their doings,\r\nand divers of them being apprehended, on the twenty 7 of August one\r\nwas hanged on the end of a signe at an Inne doore in the Towne of\r\nKingstone-uppon-Thames, for a terror to the rest. The twenty nine of\r\nAugust, two more were hanged in Smithfield, two at the Tower Hill, two\r\nbesides at Westminster, and one at Tiburn” (Stow).\r\n\r\nAn Irishman who had shown marked disrespect to the Virgin Queen\r\nreceived equally short shrift. Bren O’Royrke was arraigned at\r\nWestminster on the 28th October 1591, and found guilty of high treason\r\non ten different charges. Stow (_Annals_) records what was doubtless\r\nthe most grave of them:\r\n\r\n“That the said O’Royrke, a Dremaher aforesaide, caused the picture of a\r\nwoman to bee made, setting to her her Majestie’s, and caused it to be\r\ntyed to an horse tayle, and to bee drawne through the mire in derision\r\nof her Majestie. And after caused his Calliglasses to hew the same in\r\npieces with their axes, uttering divers traiterous and rebellious words\r\nagainst her Majestie.”\r\n\r\nWhen before his judges, he refused to plead unless he was remanded\r\nfor a week to allow a lawyer to come from Ireland, and to receive the\r\ncounsels of his friends. But he was told that if he maintained his\r\ncontemptuous attitude judgment must be given, and he was guilty of his\r\nown death; and the interpreter, one John Ly, expounded his sentence\r\nin all its gruesome detail. We learn that “Uppon Wednesday, being\r\nthe third of November, Bren O’Royrke was drawne to Tyborne and there\r\nhanged”—leaving out the disgusting after-business. But before this was\r\ndone, John Ly and the Archbishop of Cashel exhorted him to crave God\r\nand the Queen’s forgiveness. “O’Royrke turned upon him and sayde, hee\r\nhad more neede to looke to him selfe, and that he was neither here nor\r\nthere.” After his death “his heart was holden up by the hangmanne,\r\nnaming it to be the arch traytor’s heart, and then did he cast the same\r\ninto the fire.”\r\n\r\nThe execution of Dr. Lopez and his confederates for plotting with the\r\nSpaniards to poison Queen Elizabeth is graphically depicted in _Treason\r\nand Plot_, by Martin Hume. The execution took place early in June 1594:\r\n\r\n“All England was in a ferment of indignation owing to the revelations\r\nmade by Ferreira and Tinoco, and the heat introduced into the\r\naccusations against Philip and his ministers by the Essex party: and at\r\nlength, early in June, 1594, the three poor wretches, bound to hurdles,\r\nwere dragged up Holborn to Tyburn, and the penalty of treason was paid\r\nby all of them, with sickening barbarity, exceeding even the usual\r\nawful rites. It is related that one of the three, probably Tinoco who\r\nwas the youngest, recovered his feet after the hanging, and, mad with\r\npain and desperation, attacked the executioner. The crowd applauding\r\nhis pluck, broke through the guard and formed a ring to witness the\r\nunequal fight. Two burly ruffians came to the hangman’s help, but\r\none was immediately felled by a blow from the prisoner, who kept the\r\nother at bay for some time. The half-strangled creature was at length\r\nstunned by a blow upon the head, and the disembowelling then proceeded.\r\nDr. Lopez in vain tried to speak to the vast scoffing crowd. Almost\r\nincoherent with agitation he solemnly protested his innocence: mocking\r\nlaughter and ribald interruption alone greeted his despairing cry. He\r\nwas unfortunately inspired to say that he loved his mistress better\r\nthan his Saviour Jesus Christ: and this coming from a Jew so incensed\r\nthe multitude that the tumult silenced all else, and Ruy Lopez went to\r\nhis death leaving his final secret to be guessed by others.”\r\n\r\nMajor Hume was apparently convinced that Lopez was really innocent of\r\nan intention to kill Elizabeth. He _was_ guilty of an intention to\r\npoison Don Antonio, the Portuguese pretender; and he had also pretended\r\na plot against the Queen in order to get money out of the Spaniards; so\r\nin any case he was rightly punished.\r\n\r\nThe dreadful tale of horrors might be continued almost interminably.\r\nOne willingly passes over in silence many other sufferers, to include\r\njust one more notable scene at Tyburn, when, under remarkable\r\ncircumstances, the gallows took a curious part in reforming fashion in\r\nthe reign of James I.\r\n\r\nPlots grew thick and fast under the first of the Stuarts, as under his\r\npredecessors. The murder of Sir Thomas Overbury differed from most,\r\ninasmuch as it was designed to satisfy private vengeance rather than\r\nan intrigue against the State. Overbury had done all in his power to\r\nprevent the Earl of Somerset from marrying the Countess of Essex, and\r\nhad thus won her hatred. She poisoned the mind of the Earl against\r\nhis friend, and he, in turn, influenced the King. So when Sir Thomas\r\nrefused to be sent as ambassador to Brussels, James I. was easily\r\npersuaded to imprison him in the Tower. There Overbury languished and\r\ndied.\r\n\r\nThe Earl and Countess of Somerset were brought to trial, with their\r\nfour accomplices, for encompassing his death. The principals escaped,\r\nbut their accessories were condemned, and one Weston and Mrs. Turner\r\nwere hanged at Tyburn in 1615.\r\n\r\nThis murder was committed, if the evidence is to be believed, with the\r\nutmost perseverance. Witchcraft, which was believed in firmly at that\r\ntime, was attributed to Mrs. Turner. It was alleged in the trial that\r\nseven forms of poison were given by her to Sir Thomas Overbury. Arsenic\r\nwas mixed with his salt; when he asked to have some “pig” for dinner,\r\nshe put into it _lapis cortilus_, and _cantharides_ was added to the\r\nsauce instead of pepper.\r\n\r\nThe execution of Mrs. Turner excited immense interest. She had made\r\nherself famous in the fashionable world as the inventor of a yellow\r\nstarch. In allusion to this circumstance, Lord Chief-Justice Coke—who\r\nhad already addressed her in sufficiently contumelious terms, telling\r\nher categorically that she had been guilty of the seven deadly\r\nsins—declared that as she was the inventor of yellow starched ruffs\r\nand cuffs, he hoped that she would be the last by whom they would be\r\nworn. Accordingly, he gave strict orders that she should be hanged in\r\nthe very uncomfortable attire she had made so fashionable.\r\n\r\nThis amusing addition to the sentence was strictly carried out. The\r\nfair demon Mrs. Turner, on the day of her execution, came to the\r\nscaffold arrayed as if for some festive occasion, with her face\r\nmightily rouged, and a wide ruff, stiffened with yellow starch, around\r\nher neck. Numerous persons of quality, ladies as well as gentlemen,\r\nwent in their coaches to Tyburn to see the last of her. The yellow ruff\r\nwas never worn from that day.\r\n\r\nYellow starch had rendered Society stiff and uncomfortable, and Society\r\nwas only too pleased to discard its use when the originator of the\r\nfashion came to this ignominious end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nBENEATH THE TRIPLE TREE\r\n\r\n\r\nExactly the date at which the dreaded instrument at Tyburn assumed the\r\nform of the “Triple Tree” cannot be told. As has already been said,\r\nthere is reason to believe that a permanent structure—“the common\r\ngallows” of the time—was set up in the district known as Tyburn in the\r\nclosing years of the fourteenth century; and that the site was a little\r\nmore eastward, beyond the present area of the Park, than the later\r\nplace of execution.\r\n\r\nWhat particular plan the earlier structure took can only be surmised.\r\nOne is inclined to think that the gallows, like other and better\r\ninventions of civilisation, underwent stages of development; that from\r\nthe branch of the growing elm the old gibbet, with its single beam and\r\nangle bar, was first devised, and that the two upright posts with the\r\ncrossbeam followed. In all probability the gallows was then built high,\r\nso that the victim who paid the last penalty of the law swung clear\r\nabove the heads of the crowd gathered to witness the execution.\r\n\r\nNo doubt this gruesome spectacle was intended to strike awe into the\r\nhearts of the beholders. But human nature, being a thing perverse,\r\nis not always understood. Its most disastrous result on the manners\r\nof the time was rather to glorify crime and criminal. A fitting end\r\nat Tyburn gave distinction to many a poor rogue who otherwise would\r\nhave left the world unhonoured and forgotten. Four centuries of\r\nTyburn’s rough justice did less for the suppression of crime than more\r\nenlightened and humane efforts have done in the course of comparatively\r\nfew years.\r\n\r\nThe triangular plan had already been adopted in Shakespeare’s time, and\r\nprobably long before, as references to it imply a common knowledge. In\r\n_Love’s Labour Lost_, one of his earlier plays, he has Biron saying:\r\n\r\n  “Thou makest the triumviry the corner cap of Society,\r\n  The shape of Love’s Tyburn that hangs up simplicity.”\r\n\r\nIn an old quarto of 1589 occurs the passage:[2]\r\n\r\n“Then let me be put on Tyburn, that hath but three quarters.”\r\n\r\nOnly thirteen years earlier, Gascoigne, strangely enough, speaks of\r\n“Tyborne Cross.”\r\n\r\nThe gallows where so many highwaymen of the late seventeenth and\r\neighteenth centuries were, in the phrase of the day, “turned off,” is\r\nshown in the drawings of Hogarth and a host of others, as well as in\r\nmaps of contemporary date. At each of the three corners of a triangle\r\na stout upright post was set in the ground. In some cases two cross\r\nbeams are seen fastened to the tops of these posts, in others three,\r\nforming a sort of triangular enclosure. It was quite low, rising not\r\nmore than twelve feet from the ground, and giving just enough room for\r\nthe malefactor’s cart to pass beneath.\r\n\r\nSo thorough have been the measures taken to sweep Tyburn and all its\r\nassociations out of the Metropolis, since the fashionable area of\r\nthe town extended westward, that the particular spot on which stood\r\nthe “Triple Tree” is also left uncertain. It can, however, be pretty\r\nclosely approximated. It was never actually within the Royal Park, but\r\nwas just beyond its northern boundary, standing back from the high\r\nroad to Uxbridge, about a hundred yards west of the Marble Arch. A\r\nhouse near the corner of Connaught Square is believed to be built on\r\nthe actual site of Tyburn gallows, which originally stood on the rise,\r\nwhere the ground was open to the Park. The “Triple Tree” was, however,\r\nmoved to the triangular space now forming the entrance to the Edgware\r\nRoad, early in the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nI do not know if ghosts are ever seen about Connaught Square. I can\r\nfind no trace of spectral visitors disturbing the well-to-do people\r\nwho pass their lives agreeably in this now fashionable quarter. But if\r\nthere be any truth in psychical phenomena,—if, indeed, it be a fact\r\nthat the unsubstantial shades of men love in the stillness of the\r\nnight to revisit the scenes where they met a violent end,—surely they\r\nshould marshal here, not singly nor in groups, but in whole battalions,\r\ncreeping between the motor broughams which noiselessly come and go, or\r\nthe busier traffic which runs along by Park Lane and Oxford Street.\r\n\r\nWhen King Charles II. came back “to his own” in 1660, the triangular\r\ngallows at Tyburn was evidently a structure of respectable antiquity.\r\nAlready it was known to all the populace by its nickname of the “Triple\r\nTree,” which it kept for more than a century. Death was a common state\r\nat Tyburn; it was, however, reserved for this strange, easy-going,\r\ngood-natured voluptuary to hang men who were already dead there.\r\n\r\nAmid all the horrible scenes enacted at Tyburn, none are more ghastly\r\nthan the stupid, purposeless indignities wreaked by Charles and his\r\nlicentious Parliament, a year after his restoration, on the bodies of\r\nthe regicides, whom death had withdrawn from his active vengeance.\r\nThe story is briefly told in the little weekly sheet which served the\r\npurpose of a newspaper in those days:[3]\r\n\r\n“This day, Jan. 30, (we need say no more but name the day of the\r\nMoneth) was doubly observed, not onely by a Solemn Fast, Sermons and\r\nPrayers at every Parish Church, for the precious of our late pious\r\nSovereign King Charles the First of ever glorious Memory; but also\r\nby publick dragging those odious carcasses of Oliver Cromwel, Henry\r\nIreton, and John Bradshaw, to Tyburne. On Monday night, Cromwel\r\nand Ireton were drawn to Holborn from Westminster, where they were\r\ndigged up on Saturday last, and the next morning Bradshaw. To-day\r\nthey were drawn upon Sledges to Tyburne; all the way (as before from\r\nWestminster) the universal out-cry and curses of the people went along\r\nwith them. When these three carcasses were at Tyburn, they were pull’d\r\nout of their Coffins, and hang’d at the several angles of that Triple\r\nTree, where they hung till the Sun was set; after which, they were\r\ntaken down, their heads cut off, and their loathsome trunks thrown into\r\na deep hole under the gallows.”\r\n\r\nSo the mutilated corpses of Cromwell, of Ireton, his statesmanlike\r\ngeneral and brother-in-law, and Bradshaw, the president at the trial\r\nof Charles I., drawn in their shrouds from their tombs in the quiet\r\nof Henry the Seventh’s Chapel at the Abbey, gibbeted until sundown as\r\nobjects for the ridicule and derision of a demoralised mob, and then\r\ndecapitated, were flung “into a deep hole under the gallows.” And\r\nthere they may remain until this day. Who knows? The cemetery for the\r\nunnamed dead, which extended from the fatal tree towards the Marble\r\nArch, was dug up when hangings ceased on this spot, and it is probable\r\nthat the unrecognised bones of Cromwell, Ireton, and Bradshaw were in\r\nthat process swept into oblivion. The heads had been spiked on poles in\r\nfront of Westminster Hall.\r\n\r\nThe grave has gone; the remains have perished. No vestige of the\r\nhonoured dead survives; in spite of Cromwell’s gorgeous funeral, his\r\nremains are not even located.\r\n\r\nThat is just where history awakens us from musings to the unexpected\r\nreality of things. Of all the vanities of life, assuredly the love\r\nof funeral pomp and show is the most vain; and that strange vanity\r\nCromwell—hard, narrow, cold though he might be—seems to have shared to\r\nan extravagant degree. He had arranged for himself a gorgeous funeral,\r\nand one glances with amazement at the documents of the year 1658, when\r\nthe burial of the Protector had to be put off from 9th November to\r\n23rd November (he died on 3rd September) as the elaborate arrangements\r\nfor the event could not be completed by the earlier date. During the\r\nshort Protectorate of Richard Cromwell, sums were voted to the amount\r\nof £18,600 for expenses and mourning, and so many claims were brought\r\nforward for settlement, that nearly a year later, on 4th July 1659, a\r\nCommittee was appointed to inquire into the money still owing. They\r\nreported that £19,303, 0s. 11d. was the properly audited account, and\r\nthis merely for baize, cloth, velvet, and fringes. This sum represents\r\nabout £80,000 of our present money; so that an estimate of £150,000 can\r\nhardly be too large for the expenses of Oliver Cromwell’s funeral.\r\n\r\nApart from these outrages on the dead, Tyburn witnessed the final\r\nscenes in the lives of two military officers, Hacker and Axtele, who\r\nhad guarded Charles I., and of at least three of the judges, Okey,\r\nBarkstead, and Corbet, who had pronounced sentence upon him. Others\r\nof the regicides were done to death at Charing Cross, with all the\r\nbarbarous additions of drawing, decapitating, and quartering. It seems\r\nsingular that these revolting scenes, relics of an earlier and, one\r\nwould have thought, a more brutal age, occasioned no condemnation\r\nfrom the finer spirits of the day. Old Pepys, amiable and gossipy\r\non whatever subject passed under his notice, was only led by the\r\nexecutions to a pious and somewhat inapposite reflection, “Wonderful\r\nare the ways of Providence!” And the courtly Evelyn, who had the grace\r\nto secretly disapprove of them, contents himself with writing in his\r\nDiary:\r\n\r\n“I saw not the executions, but met their quarters, mangled, cut, and\r\nreeking, as they were brought from the gallows on a hurdle.”\r\n\r\nIn 1908 one of the former victims of Tyburn was canonised, a fact that\r\nbrings the past and to-day into close proximity. The history of Oliver\r\nPlunket—a name well known in Ireland—is both romantic and sad.\r\n\r\nCelebrated as a high-minded and high-living Archbishop of Armagh,\r\nOliver Plunket ended his days at Tyburn in 1681, a victim of the\r\n“Popish Plot.” After spending more than two and a half years in\r\ndungeons, first in Dublin and then in Newgate, he was hanged, drawn,\r\nand quartered. His body was buried in St. Giles’s-in-the-Fields by\r\nFather Corker, who had been his companion in Newgate. His head was\r\nsent to Rome to Cardinal Howard, and brought back to Ireland in\r\n1722, and is preserved in the Convent of Drogheda, which was founded\r\nby his great-niece. In fact, all honour was paid to his remains as\r\nrelics. When Father Corker buried the body he cut off the arms, one of\r\nwhich was long preserved in Herefordshire, and one in the Franciscan\r\nConvent at Taunton. This priest afterwards sent the body to Germany,\r\nbut when the English monks were expelled from that country in 1803,\r\nPlunket’s body was brought back to England, and buried at St. Gregory’s\r\nMonastery, Downside, Bath.\r\n\r\nTruly a tragic history, and one fraught with so much valour and\r\nstrength of character, that the Irish must feel proud of the dignity of\r\ncanonisation now bestowed on their hero.\r\n\r\nThe Rye House Plot against the lives of Charles II. and his brother,\r\nthen James, Duke of York, was the means of another distinguished\r\nman, Sir Thomas Armstrong, suffering an ignominious end on Tyburn’s\r\nfatal tree. Later, a further victim was claimed in Elizabeth Gaunt,\r\nwho had sheltered one of the conspirators. After the failure of the\r\nplot Armstrong fled to Holland, but was seized at Leyden in 1684, and\r\nconveyed to England, swearing his innocence. He was taken before Judge\r\nJefferies, and when again he insisted on his innocence, protested\r\nagainst the perjured evidence, and asked for nothing but the free\r\ncourse of the law, Jefferies said “he should have it to the full”; and\r\nso ordered his execution within six days. Like a common malefactor,\r\nthe knight was dragged through the streets to Tyburn on a hurdle, and\r\nwas there hanged and quartered. Bishop Burnett says that one of the\r\nquarters was sent to Stafford, which place Armstrong represented in\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nThe execution of Elizabeth Gaunt was a still more shameless affair, and\r\nbears witness to the degeneracy and brutal inhumanity of the times. She\r\nwas then an old woman, well known for her good works in helping the\r\nafflicted and visiting the prisoners. Among those who took part in the\r\nRye House Plot was one James Burton, for whose apprehension a reward\r\nwas offered. Chance led him in the way of Elizabeth Gaunt, who assisted\r\nhim to the utmost of her power, and sent him in a boat to Gravesend,\r\nwhence he escaped to Amsterdam. He was supplied with a large sum of\r\nmoney by his benefactress. On Monmouth’s landing in England to raise\r\nthe standard of rebellion in 1685, Burton came among his following,\r\nfought in the hopeless fight at Sedgemoor, and after the rout fled to\r\nLondon, where he took refuge in the house of John Fernley, a barber in\r\nWhitechapel.\r\n\r\nFernley was poor, and his creditors were troubling him. Yet, though he\r\nknew the Government were offering £100 for Burton, he would not betray\r\nhim. The wretch, whom he was thus sheltering, had no such scruples.\r\nFinding that James II. was dealing out punishment more severely to\r\nthose who sheltered rebels, than to the rebels themselves, he gave\r\nhimself up to the Government, and tendered information against both\r\nFernley and Elizabeth Gaunt.\r\n\r\nThey were brought to trial, and Burton was the chief witness against\r\nthem. Of Burton’s fate we learn nothing. Fernley was hanged, and for\r\nElizabeth Gaunt was reserved the more dreadful end of death by fire.\r\nWilliam Penn, the famous Quaker, who lies buried at Jordans, near\r\nBeaconsfield, and who during his life travelled far afield and founded\r\nPennsylvania, went to Tyburn to witness the execution. He afterwards\r\nrelated that, when this poor woman had calmly disposed the straw\r\nabout her in such a manner as to hasten the blaze and so shorten her\r\nsufferings, all the bystanders burst into tears.\r\n\r\nElizabeth Gaunt was the last woman who suffered death in England for a\r\npolitical offence.\r\n\r\nTyburn, however, enjoys such reputation—if that is the word—as still\r\nclings to the name, less from its nobler victims than from those\r\ndarlings of the populace, the highwaymen of a later day, whose exploits\r\nwere deservedly cut short by the hangman’s noose; and we must hurry\r\non. One more State plot in the reign of William III. (Mary had been\r\ndead a year) had its sequel under the Triple Tree, and the affair is\r\nworth mention, because it throws a weird light on public manners so\r\nlate as two centuries ago. This was the Assassination Plot, for alleged\r\nparticipation in which, Sir William Parkyns and Sir John Friend, a\r\nnon-juror, were condemned to die.\r\n\r\nSir John Friend, whom Lord Macaulay describes as “a man who had made a\r\nvery large fortune by brewing, and who spent it freely in sedition,”\r\nthought the whole thing so rash that he refused to join it from the\r\nfirst. Sir William Parkyns, old and gouty as he was, amassed arms at\r\nhis country house sufficient for a troop of cavalry.\r\n\r\nIt was first suggested to assassinate William III. just as the royal\r\ncoach was passing from Hyde Park, where Apsley House now stands, into\r\nthe Green Park, but afterwards it was agreed to murder him when he was\r\ngoing to hunt at Richmond. The secret leaked out; the chase was given\r\nup at the last moment, and the chiefs of the conspiracy were sought\r\nfor. Parkyns was found concealed in a garret in the Temple, and Friend\r\nat the house of a Quaker, where he had taken refuge. Lord Macaulay\r\ndescribes the final scene, which had some dramatic moments.\r\n\r\n“The execution of the two knights was eagerly expected by the\r\npopulation of London. The States General were informed by their\r\ncorrespondent that of all the sights, that in which the English most\r\ndelighted was a hanging, and that of all hangings within the memory of\r\nthe oldest man, that of Friend and Parkyns had excited the greatest\r\ninterest. The multitude had been incensed against Friend by reports\r\ntouching the exceeding badness of the beer he had brewed. It was even\r\nrumoured that he had, in his zeal for the Jacobite cause, poisoned all\r\nthe casks which he had furnished to the Navy. An innumerable crowd\r\naccordingly assembled at Tyburn.”\r\n\r\nScaffolding had been put up for the hanging, and an amphitheatre was\r\nformed around the gallows. It was known that a fashionable throng would\r\nassemble, and therefore everything was done to make them happy and\r\ncomfortable, and to give them an opportunity of thoroughly enjoying the\r\nshow. On these benches the wealthier spectators stood, row above row.\r\nWhen expectation was at its height, it was announced that the hanging\r\nwas deferred. Rough words passed, and rougher actions followed. The\r\nmob broke up in bad humour, and not without many fights and broken\r\nnoses between those who had given money for their places, and those who\r\nrefused to return it.\r\n\r\n“The cause of this severe disappointment was a resolution passed in\r\nthe Commons ... that a Committee should be sent to the Tower to examine\r\nthe prisoners, holding out the hope that if they gave full and frank\r\nconfession the House would intercede for them.\r\n\r\n“Friend and Parkyns were again interrogated, but to no purpose. They\r\nhad, after sentence had been passed on them, shown instances of\r\nweakness, and Parkyns’ daughter exhorted him not to give way.\r\n\r\n“In a few hours the crowd again assembled at Tyburn; and this time\r\nthe sightseers were not defrauded of their amusement. They saw,\r\nindeed, one sight which they had not expected, and which produced a\r\ngreater sensation than the execution itself. Jeremy Collier and two\r\nother non-juring divines of less celebrity, named Cook and Snatt, had\r\nattended the prisoners in Newgate, and were with them in the cart\r\nunder the gallows. When the prayers were said, and just before the\r\nhangman did his office, the three schismatical priests stood up and\r\nlaid their hands on the heads of the dying men, who continued to kneel.\r\nCollier pronounced a form of absolution taken from the Service for the\r\nVisitation of the Sick, and his brethren exclaimed “Amen!” Collier was\r\noutlawed for this action, and his two colleagues suffered imprisonment.”\r\n\r\nSo in the closing years of the seventeenth century the love of\r\nwitnessing a gruesome spectacle was more rife than ever, and a public\r\nhanging still formed quite a fashionable entertainment; in fact, it\r\nbecame more and more so, until in Horace Walpole’s time it was the\r\nsmart thing to visit the prisoners in Newgate and to be present at\r\nexecutions.\r\n\r\nNewgate, which ultimately replaced Tyburn, and within whose walls\r\nthe last hanging in the actual City of London took place, was only\r\ndemolished in 1904. I well remember, not long before that, going over\r\nthis gruesome and historical old pile. Many of the cells were just as\r\nthey had been for centuries, but the most terrible of all were the\r\ndungeons. Our modern coal cellars are far preferable, for at least\r\ntheir walls are whitewashed and they are drained to frustrate the damp.\r\nThese terrible dungeons at Newgate, with slanting floors, slanting\r\nwalls, and slanting roofs, and almost without light and ventilation,\r\nhad contained dozens of human beings, who were literally herded\r\ntogether, to live or die as chance might ordain. Plague and pestilence\r\nswept through those loathsome dens, and after seeing them on the eve\r\nof their destruction, one realised how easy it was to start the great\r\nplague of London from them alone.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners in Newgate in the eighteenth century were allowed to\r\nspend the money given them as they liked; and they often rigged\r\nthemselves out in the height of fashion, in which practice their\r\ndistinguished visitors encouraged them.\r\n\r\nOn the Sunday before their execution, the victims were permitted to\r\nreceive visits from all their friends, who brought special gifts for\r\nthe journey to Tyburn: a white cap with black ribbons, a prayer-book, a\r\nnosegay; and always an orange to hold in the hand as they sat on their\r\nown coffin, trundling along in the cart to the scaffold.\r\n\r\nThese same friends often lingered at the foot of the Triple Tree, when,\r\nthe three-mile journey over, the sentence was carried out, in order\r\nto be at hand to hang on to the legs of the condemned and thus put a\r\nspeedy end to his sufferings. Not so friendly was the purpose of the\r\nrespectably-dressed women in deep mourning, who, professing to be the\r\nnearest of kin to the deceased, mingled in the crowd in the hope of\r\nsecuring the body for some anatomist.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the eighteenth century people began to travel\r\nfarther afield. They were richer, more numerous, and more enterprising;\r\nthey made journeys by coach to Bath and Cheltenham to drink the waters,\r\nor went out for the evening to Vauxhall Gardens to dine and gamble,\r\ndance and make merry. Fine clothes, costly jewels, and gambling gains\r\nwere spoils easily disposed of, and highwaymen and footpads quickly\r\nfollowed in their wake. Naturally, places near the Metropolis were\r\nthe most lucrative. If nothing of value was secured from the coach\r\nbelonging to Lord A——, another coach owned by the Marquis of B—— soon\r\npassed by, and loot might be forthcoming; if not, the highwaymen waited\r\nfor Mr. C——.\r\n\r\nOutlying districts of London became unsafe at night, and Highgate,\r\nHampstead, Richmond, Hounslow, and Shooter’s Hill were all hot-beds of\r\nrobbery by these “gentlemen of the road.” Hyde Park and Knightsbridge\r\ncame in for a share of petty larcenies and assaults by the meaner\r\nfootpads and outlaws who lurked at many a dark corner, and few persons\r\nthought of going home by night except under escort, and with torches\r\nto light the gloom of the streets. It was a short life, if a desperate\r\nand at times a merry one. Of all the famous highwaymen who dangled on\r\nTyburn gibbet, one finds few who lived to see the age of thirty.\r\n\r\nJack Sheppard, though not the romantic figure of the moonlit heath, but\r\na meaner thief, must, I suppose, take pride of place. Never was there\r\na more dare-devil character hanged at Hyde Park. Fielding and Harrison\r\nAinsworth have glorified his career, and some of the facts of his\r\nlife are told in a pamphlet published by Daniel Defoe at the request\r\nof Sheppard himself, containing a _Narrative of all the Robberies,\r\nEscapes, etc., of John Sheppard_. This, he declares, was “written by\r\nhimselfe during his confinement in the Middle Stone Room” at Newgate.\r\nSays Jack:\r\n\r\n“I was born in Stepney Parish, the Year Queen Anne came to the Crown;\r\nmy Father a Carpenter by Trade, and an honest industrious character,\r\nand my Mother bore and deserved the same. She being left a Widow in\r\nthe early Part of my Life, continued the Business, and kept myselfe,\r\ntogether with another unfortunate son, and a daughter at Mr. Garrett’s\r\nSchool near Great St. Hellen’s in Bishopsgate Parish, till Mr.\r\nKneebone, a Woollen draper in the Strand, an Acquaintance ... being\r\ndesirous to settle me to a Trade, ... agreed with Mr. Owen Wood a\r\nCarpenter of Drury-Lane to take me an Apprentice for Seven Years.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JACK SHEPPARD.\r\n\r\n_From an Old Print._]\r\n\r\nSheppard describes Mr. and Mrs. Wood as “strict observers of the\r\nSabbath,” which he thought fit to spend in his own manner, and he\r\nfell into evil ways. For this he blamed Joseph Hind, who kept the\r\n“Black Lyon Alehouse in Drury-Lane.” Here he met Bess Lyon, who was his\r\nruin, and for whose benefit most of his robberies were committed.\r\n\r\nHe asserts that his first crime was stealing two silver spoons from the\r\nRummer Tavern in Charing Cross. In 1723 he describes being sent to the\r\nhouse of a Mr. Bains to do some carpentering, where he stole a roll of\r\nfustian (24 yards) from amongst others, and offered it for sale at 12d.\r\nper yard, but having no offers, he concealed it in his master’s house.\r\nIn the following August he was making some shutters for Mr. Bains, and\r\nin the night entered by the cellar window, taking £14 worth of goods,\r\nand £7 in money. When he went next day he found the shop shut, and the\r\nBains family in much trouble, in which he greatly sympathised. A fellow\r\napprentice saw the fustian and told Mr. Wood, so Sheppard broke into\r\nWood’s house in the night and took it away again, but the Bains family\r\nfollowed him up, and in spite of his own and his brother’s assertions\r\nof innocence, he was compelled to restore what remained.\r\n\r\nFrom that time such a number of thefts and burglaries were committed\r\nthat Jack Sheppard soon made a reputation. The _Tyburn Chronicle_,\r\nwriting of this part of his life, says:\r\n\r\n“Jack was now so eminent, that there was not a blackguard in St.\r\nGiles’s but thought it an honour, as well as an advantage, to be\r\nadmitted to his company.”\r\n\r\nLater he made his headquarters in the Hampstead district, and\r\ncommitted a robbery in the Hampstead Road.\r\n\r\nHis clever escapes, when in prison for his many offences, stimulated\r\nthe interest and admiration of the people. Confined in St. Giles’s\r\nRound House, he made a hole in the roof, from which he flung a cartload\r\nof stones on the people in the street below. Later, Bess Lyon was\r\ncommitted to the St. Anne’s Round House. Sheppard went to see her, and\r\nwas promptly shut up there as an accomplice. He wrenched the bars from\r\nthe window, and tying the blanket and sheet together, first let her\r\ndown, and then followed himself.\r\n\r\nJoseph Blake, alias Blueskin, and his brother Tom Sheppard decided\r\nto hire a stable at the Horse Ferry at Westminster, and there store\r\ntheir stolen goods until they could dispose of them. They took a man\r\nnamed Field, who had been indicted for felony and burglary (and found\r\nreceiving a safer business), to see these goods, hoping he would buy\r\nthem, but he only betrayed them to Jonathan Wild. Jack Sheppard, in\r\nhis _Narrative_, says that Field broke into the stable, and stole some\r\ncloth he had himself stolen from Mr. Kneebone. Sheppard and Blueskin\r\nwere arrested, and condemned to death. Sheppard managed to again\r\nescape, by breaking off a spike at the hatch where the prisoners came\r\nto speak with their friends. In the evening two acquaintances came to\r\nsee him, and as he thrust his head and shoulders through the opening\r\nthey managed to pull him out.\r\n\r\nAfter this he went to Northampton to some relations, who did not give\r\nhim a warm welcome. Committing more robberies, he then retired to\r\nFinchley. There he was again found, and brought to Newgate. He was\r\nput in the “Castle,” the strongest part; but his last escape had made\r\nsuch a commotion that crowds came to see him in gaol. However, the\r\nprison-breaker was so closely watched that they could not bring him an\r\nimplement of any kind, but there were few who went away without giving\r\nhim money.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th October 1724, immediately after his keeper had brought him\r\ndinner, Sheppard began to prepare for his flight. This he effected by\r\nmaking a hole in the chimney, and having wrenched the chain between his\r\nfetters, he was able with the broken links to pull an iron bar away.\r\nMaking another hole in the chimney, he gained access by its means to\r\nthe Red Room over the “Castle,” which had not been opened for seven\r\nyears. Sheppard, however, pulled off the lock, and entered the Chapel.\r\nThere fresh difficulties beset him. The doors resisted his efforts, and\r\nSt. Sepulchre’s bells struck eight before he reached the leads. Looking\r\nround for means of descent, he found the house adjoining Newgate was\r\nthe most suitable, but the leap was too dangerous, so he returned to\r\nthe “Castle” and fetched a blanket, fixed it to the wall, and sliding\r\ndown dropped to the leads as the clock struck nine. The garret door was\r\nopen, but people were moving in the house until midnight, when he went\r\ndownstairs and so into the street.\r\n\r\nTwo days after, he personally left at the house of Mr. Applebee, in\r\nBlackfriars (a printer), a letter saying that as he had cheated him\r\nout of the account of his execution, which would be a loss to his\r\njournal, Applebee might make what use he liked of the letter Jack\r\nSheppard was then leaving.\r\n\r\nHe continued committing burglaries in London, one of which was in the\r\nhouse of Mr. Rawlins, a pawnbroker in Drury Lane. Mr. Rawlins realised\r\nthere was somebody in the house. Sheppard, hearing him move, made a\r\ngreat noise and scuffling, and shouted, “Fire at the first man that\r\ncomes!” All the time his accomplices were imaginary, as he was alone.\r\nBy this ruse he got away. Soon after he appeared in his old haunts and\r\namongst his old comrades, dressed in the height of fashion. On 31st\r\nOctober he dined with two friends, one of them Bess Lyon, and sent for\r\nhis mother, who begged him to be cautious. This was his last piece of\r\nbravado. He had been drinking heavily, and, continuing his visits to\r\nale-houses, was given up by a bar-keeper and removed to Newgate.\r\n\r\nFamous beyond all his contemporaries, his visitors were even more\r\nnumerous than before. Many people of high degree crowded to see him in\r\nhis fetters. Sheppard entertained them with stories of his exploits.\r\nEven to the end he had hoped that his friends would rescue him. When he\r\nleft the prison for Tyburn on the 16th November 1724, an open penknife\r\nwas concealed in his pocket. Apparently, he intended to cut the rope\r\nthat bound his hands, on his way to the gallows, and then throw himself\r\nover into the crowd and escape. But the penknife was discovered as he\r\nwas leaving Newgate. He was too closely guarded for a rescue to be\r\npossible. He died “with much difficulty, and with uncommon pity from\r\nall spectators.”\r\n\r\n_The British Journal_ of 21st November 1724 records that a bailiff\r\nin Long Acre having procured Sheppard’s body for the purpose of\r\ndissection, the friends of the young desperado caused a great riot in\r\nLong Acre, and Justices of the Peace being summoned, they sent to the\r\nSavoy (then a Royal Palace) with a request that a party of Footguards\r\nmight be despatched. The chief promoters were seized, and the body\r\nhanded to a gentleman who asked that he might be permitted to see to\r\nits proper burial. The mob had fought over the corpse at Tyburn, where\r\na man was waiting with a hearse to take it decently to a grave already\r\nprepared in St. Sepulchre’s. But the bailiff above mentioned had\r\nreported that he was employed by surgeons, and pretended to rescue the\r\nbody from them.\r\n\r\nThus ended the famous Jack Sheppard.\r\n\r\nOf a different stamp to Jack Sheppard, and a much greater ruffian, was\r\nhis little less notorious contemporary Jonathan Wild. This man was a\r\nproduct of the age and of the extraordinary remissness of the law,\r\nwhich made his operations both possible and profitable. The smallest\r\nthefts, if only of the value of one shilling, were punishable then, and\r\nlong afterwards, by death. Nothing shows more strikingly, how remote we\r\nof this twentieth century are from the cruelty and harshness of only a\r\ncentury ago, than the short extracts which it is the custom of some of\r\nthe older London newspapers, _The Times_ and _The Observer_ among them,\r\nto reprint from their issues of a hundred years back. Time after time\r\nyou read, packed away in a few lines, as though of little concern, the\r\nproceedings at the Old Bailey Sessions, thus: “Joseph Bailey, convicted\r\nof the theft of spoons. Death.” Again, “Henry Trudwick, convicted of\r\nthe theft of an embroidered waistcoat. Death.” Even the abstraction of\r\na pocket-handkerchief has sufficed to bring a lad to the gallows.\r\n\r\nEvery Sunday morning in sessions, the box for the condemned in Newgate\r\nprison chapel was crowded with wretches, who were to die on the morrow.\r\nLooking over the galleries and shouting down encouragement to them,\r\nwith many oaths and much blasphemy, was another group, equally large.\r\nThese were awaiting trial and sentence, and were soon to fill the\r\nempty places. Executions were so common that the few newspapers of\r\nthe eighteenth century took no trouble to record them, save when the\r\nharvest of death was unusually large, or some picturesque villain by\r\nhis dashing exploits filled the public eye, and a far-spreading crowd\r\ngathered to see his exit from the stage.\r\n\r\nThe rigour with which capital punishment was applied to almost every\r\ncrime sent troops of victims to Tyburn’s “triple tree.” Also it became\r\nresponsible for many ill-favoured ruffians escaping penalty of any\r\nkind. But while the criminal code was remorseless in its treatment of\r\nthe meaner offender, it took no account of the man who was responsible\r\nfor inciting and abetting him, the “fence,” or receiver of stolen\r\ngoods. It made no attempt to reach him. That finer subtlety of the\r\nlaw, the “compounding of a felony,” was a much later abstraction; and\r\na feature of the newspapers of the day was the list of advertisements\r\nfrom people whose property had been stolen, and who were quite willing\r\nto pay handsomely for its return. Some of them are quaint reading, as\r\nthis from _The Postman_ (from Tuesday, 25th June, to Thursday, 27th\r\nJune 1706):\r\n\r\n“Stoln, June 17th instant, from Crum-House, on Black Heath, near\r\nGreenwich, 6 Knives, 5 Spoons, 5 Forks, 2 Salts, 1 Soop spoon or Ladle,\r\n1 Snuff Pan and 1 pair of Snuffers, in all about 100 oz. of Plate,\r\nhaving for Arms 3 Stags upon a Bend, Crest the Eagle and Child or an\r\nEarl’s Coronet. 1 Indian Chinks Quilt of many colours, the border a\r\nyellowish colour with red, green and flesh colour in the figures, the\r\nother side a dark grownd with yellow flowers, bordered with a light\r\ncolour, 1 other Indian Chinks quilt, the grownd bluish with large\r\nflowers. If any of the above-mentioned goods are offer’d to be sold\r\nor pawn’d, all persons are desired to stop the same, and give speedy\r\nnotice to Mr. Peter Haraches, Goldsmith, in Suffolk-street, who is to\r\ngive £10 Reward for the whole or proportionable for any part.”\r\n\r\nAnother in the _Daily Courant_, 10th September 1706, runs thus:\r\n\r\n“Whereas between Monday Night (the 2nd Instant) and Tuesday Morning,\r\nthere was taken from the House of Mr. Tovey at Blacklands near Chelsea,\r\nthe Goods following: viz. 1 Silver Skillet mark’d with a short\r\nRinghandle, a Crest of a Faunes Head graved in an Emboss’d Escuchion,\r\nthe Motto Fuimus, 5 large Silver Spoons mark’d C.T., and a Crest of a\r\nGriffin sedant; 6 little old Sweetmeat Spoons with Forks at the Ends,\r\nmark’d C.T. on the Bowles: 1 little Cup crack’d in the Brim near the\r\nHandle; an ovil Silver Tobacco Box without a Mark; a Common Prayer Book\r\ngarded with Silver engrav’d, but 1 Clasp on, mark’d on the inside W, a\r\nsmall Child’s Spoon mark’d A.K., an old Beavor Hat, a pair of Coffee\r\ncolour Gloves stitch’d with White Silk, and a fine Muslin neckcloth. If\r\nthese or any of these are profer’d to be sold or pawn’d, it is desir’d\r\nthe Party may be stop’d; or if already sold or pawn’d that Notice may\r\nbe giv’n to the said Mr. Tovey at the Golden Horse Shooe in the Strand\r\nnear old Round Court, as speedy as may be. For which trouble shall be a\r\nhandsome reward.”\r\n\r\nAn advertisement from _The Postman_ of the date before given strikes at\r\nhigher game:\r\n\r\n“Whereas a Highway Man on a bright Grey Horse in a blue close Bodied\r\nCoat with black Buttons, and a loose dark colour’d Coat over it, took\r\nfrom some Passengers in the Oxford Coach going to the Bath on Saturday\r\nthe 20th of this instant July, between Cirencester and Detmarton an\r\nAmathist Ring, the Stone of a fine purple colour, and well set in\r\ngold: together with a middle siz’d Pendulum Watch made by Jarret of\r\nLondon, in a Terroise-shell Case studded with Silver, a Squirrel eating\r\nNuts, and several Butterflies being represented in it. If the said\r\nRing or Watch be offer’d to be pawn’d or sold the Person to whom they\r\nare so offer’d are desir’d to stop ’em and give notice to Mr. Tonson,\r\nBookseller, under Grey’s Inn Gate in Grey’s Inn Lane, or Mr. Scot at\r\nthe Dolphin Tavern in Tower street, London, and they shall be well\r\nrewarded, and if they are already pawn’d or sold they shall receive\r\ntheir money again with content.”\r\n\r\nThere is suppressed agony in this plaint of a tradesman in the\r\n_Mercurius Politicus_ (Thursday, 21st October, to Thursday, 28th\r\nOctober 1658):\r\n\r\n“Daniel Neech, alias Carlton (supposed to be about the City) of tall\r\nstature, long-visag’d, a down look, black hollow-eyed, sad brown hair,\r\nsomewhat short and curled, a little stooping at shoulders, about 26\r\nyear old, of a pale complexion, in a new grey Sute and Coat with black\r\nribbon, a ruff black Hat, who is run from his Master with several sums\r\nof Money. Make stay of him, and give notice to Mr. Richard Lightfoot,\r\nnext to the Miter Tavern in Wood street, and you shall be well paid for\r\nyour pains.”\r\n\r\nJonathan Wild did a flourishing business as a receiver and restorer—for\r\nreward—of stolen goods to their proper owner. A system that existed\r\nof giving certain rewards for information concerning various offences\r\nprovided him with a lucrative profession. For instance:\r\n\r\nInformation of Highway robbery was rewarded by £40, the horse, arms,\r\nfurniture, and money belonging to the robber; and a Tyburn Ticket,\r\nwhich he could transfer for the sum of £25 or £30.\r\n\r\nParticulars of a burglary gained the informant £40 and a Tyburn Ticket.\r\n\r\nInformation of horse-stealing was rewarded by a Tyburn Ticket.\r\n\r\nOf cattle-stealing, £10.\r\n\r\nWild’s transactions, in fact, became so great a menace to the public\r\nsafety that they were the cause of the first Act directed against\r\nthieves’ “fences” being placed on the Statute Book. In his case, the\r\ntemptation of doing a little thieving on his own account proved too\r\nstrong, and it was this, after a nefarious career only too protracted,\r\nthat brought him eventually to the gallows at Tyburn.\r\n\r\nOne story told of him is that a lady went in her sedan-chair to pay a\r\nvisit in Piccadilly. The chairmen left the beautiful _verni martin_\r\npainted coach at the door, and waited for her return at a neighbouring\r\nalehouse. While they were drinking, the chair, with the velvet seat\r\nand furniture, was carried off. The chairmen immediately applied to\r\nWild, and after taking his usual fee of a crown, he told them he would\r\nconsider the matter, and desired them to call in a day or two. They\r\nwent at the time appointed, when Wild insisted upon a considerable\r\nreward, which they paid him. Then he bade them be sure to attend the\r\nprayers of Lincoln’s Inn Chapel the next morning. They went there\r\naccordingly, and were equally surprised and pleased to find their\r\nlady’s chair under the piazzas of the Chapel, with the seats and\r\nfurniture in the same condition as when it was stolen.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Jonathan Wild pelted by the mob on his way to Tyburn.\r\n\r\n_From Print in the “Tyburn Chronicle.”_]\r\n\r\nEven after sentence Wild hoped that he would be freed. As a\r\ncircumstance in his favour he mentioned that he had himself handed\r\nover forty criminals to justice. This did him no good, but incensed\r\nthe populace against him. While awaiting execution he took laudanum in\r\nhis cell with the hope of suicide, and was still under its influence\r\non arriving at Tyburn. The hangman told him to prepare himself, and\r\nleft him sitting in the cart. But the mob became so unmanageable at\r\nthe delay, that the hangman was obliged hurriedly to carry out his\r\noffice. Jonathan Wild was executed 25th May 1725, and was buried at two\r\no’clock the next morning at St. Pancras Churchyard, but his body was\r\nafterwards removed for dissection.\r\n\r\nThe _London Journal_, Saturday, 29th May 1725, says:\r\n\r\n“Never was there a greater crowd assembled on any occasion, than to\r\nsee this unhappy Person; and so outrageous were the Mob in their Joy\r\nto behold him on the Road to the Gallows, who had been the cause of\r\nsending so many thither, that they huzza’d him along to the Triple\r\nTree, and show’d a Temper very uncommon on such a melancholy Occasion,\r\nfor they threw Stones at him; with some of which his head was broke,\r\nand the two malefactors, Sperry and Sandford, between whom he sate in\r\nthe Cart, were hurt: Nay, even in his last moments they did not cease\r\ntheir insults.”\r\n\r\nOther adventurers who paid the penalty to outraged justice at Tyburn\r\nwere Henry Simms, who declared he had swallowed the rings he had stolen\r\n“wrapped in the skin of a duck’s leg, well buttered”; “Sixteen String\r\nJack,” or more correctly, John Rann; Jack Hall, the chimney-sweeper;\r\nJohn Smith, who, waiting about at Paddington hoping to steal something,\r\nfelt his heart fail him when he saw the gallows at Tyburn, but his\r\naccomplice kept him to his purpose; and Kingsmill, Perin, and Fairall,\r\nthe smugglers. Perin was ordered only to be hanged and afterwards\r\nburied, and Kingsmill and Fairall to be hung in chains,—a gruesome\r\nadjunct to that sentence being that the bodies first received a\r\ncoating of black pitch. Perin was saying to his companions that he\r\nlamented their cases, when Fairall smilingly replied:\r\n\r\n“We shall be hanging in the sweet air, when you are rotting in your\r\ngrave.”\r\n\r\nThese gangs of highwaymen, footpads, burglars, and common thieves\r\nhad a curious dialect of their own, a few words of which and their\r\nequivalents may be taken from the vocabulary given in the _Tyburn\r\nChronicle_:\r\n\r\n  The Rumbo or Whit             Newgate.\r\n  The Spinning Ken              Bridewell.\r\n  The Dancers                   Stairs.\r\n  The Mount                     London Bridge.\r\n  The Glaze                     The Window.\r\n  A Ken                         House.\r\n  A Bridle-Call                 A Highwayman.\r\n  A Cruiser                     Beggar.\r\n  The Cull gigs                 The man looks.\r\n  Pops                          Pistols.\r\n  A Glim                        Candle.\r\n  Darbies                       Fetters.\r\n  To be Topped or Scragged      Hanged.\r\n  Feeders                       A Bit or Truff.\r\n  A Peter                       Purse.\r\n  A Jacob                       Ladder.\r\n  A Rum Fam                     Ring.\r\n  A Tumbler                     Cart.\r\n  A Rattler                     Coach.\r\n  Ridge                         Gold.\r\n  Wedge                         Silver.\r\n  The Tatler is up              The moon shines.\r\n  A Twang                       A Bully.\r\n\r\nThe highwayman struck at big game, and persons of the highest\r\n“quality”—to adopt the phrase of the day—did not consider it in any\r\nway derogatory to display the keenest interest in him. The darling of\r\nthe lower orders needed only a dashing exploit or two to his credit,\r\nand a hair’s-breadth escape from the armed men sent to track him down,\r\nto make him equally the darling of the drawing-room. Fine ladies\r\nwent to see him in chains at Newgate, often to condole with him, and\r\ngive him money. Horace Walpole grows quite enthusiastic over MᶜLean,\r\na former grocer of Welbeck Street, who took to the road, and in the\r\ncourse of his depredations relieved Walpole of his watch and sword. The\r\ncircumstances of the robbery are told in the _Gentleman’s Magazine_ of\r\n1749:\r\n\r\n“The Hon. Horatio Walpole, brother to the Earl of Orford, who was\r\nrobbed by two men on the 7th (of Nov.) in Hyde Park, when a pistol\r\ngoing off shot through the coach, and scorched his face, received a\r\nletter from the robbers, intimating their concern for the accident, and\r\ntheir apprehension of the consequences at that time; and that, if he\r\nwould send, to a place named, a person would be there to deliver his\r\nwatch, sword, and coachman’s watch, if he would, on his honour, send\r\n40 guineas in less than an hour to the same place, with threats of\r\ndestruction if he did not. But he did not comply, though he afterwards\r\noffered 20, the sum they fell to in a second letter.”\r\n\r\nHorace Walpole writes in 1750 to Horace Mann:\r\n\r\n“I have been in town for a day or two, and heard no conversation\r\nbut about MᶜLean, a fashionable highwayman, who is just taken, and\r\nwho robbed me among others; as Lord Eglinton, Sir Thomas Robinson of\r\nVienna, Mrs. Talbot, etc. He took an odd booty from the Scotch Earl, a\r\nblunderbuss, which lies very formidably upon the justice’s table. He\r\nwas taken by selling a laced waistcoat to a pawnbroker, who happened\r\nto carry it to the very man who had just sold the lace. His history is\r\nvery particular, for he confesses every thing, and is so little of a\r\nhero, that he cries and begs, and I believe, if Lord Eglinton had been\r\nin any luck, might have been robbed of his own blunderbuss. His father\r\nwas an Irish Dean; his brother is a Calvinist minister in great esteem\r\nat the Hague. He himself was a grocer, but, losing a wife that he loved\r\nextremely about two years ago ... he quitted his business with two\r\nhundred pounds in his pocket, which he soon spent, and then took to the\r\nroad with only one companion, Plunket, a journeyman apothecary, whom he\r\nhas impeached but [who] has not been taken.\r\n\r\n“MᶜLean had a lodging in St. James’s Street, over against White’s,\r\nand another at Chelsea.... There was a wardrobe of clothes, three and\r\ntwenty purses, and the celebrated blunderbuss found at his lodgings....\r\n\r\n“As I conclude he will suffer, and wish him no ill, I don’t care to\r\nhave his idea, and am almost single in not having been to see him. Lord\r\nMountford at the head of half White’s, went the first day: his Aunt\r\nwas crying over him; as soon as they were withdrawn, she said to him,\r\nknowing they were of White’s, ‘My dear, what did the lords say to you?\r\nhave you ever been concerned with any of them?’ Was it not admirable?\r\nWhat a favourable idea people must have of White’s! and what if White’s\r\nshould not deserve a much better! But the chief personages who have\r\nbeen to comfort and weep over this fallen hero are Lady Caroline\r\nPetersham and Miss Ashe.”\r\n\r\nWalpole a few days later writes to the same correspondent:\r\n\r\n“My friend MᶜLean is still the fashion; have not I reason to call\r\nhim friend? He says, if the pistol had shot me, he had another for\r\nhimself. Can I do less than say I will be hanged if he is? They have\r\nmade a print, a very dull one, of what I think I said to Lady Caroline\r\nPetersham about him.\r\n\r\n“Thus I stand like the Turk with his doxies round.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“MᶜLean is condemned, and will hang. I am honourably mentioned in a\r\nGrub ballad for not having contributed to his sentence. There are\r\nas many prints and pamphlets about him as about the earthquake. His\r\nprofession grows no joke; I was sitting in my own dining-room on Sunday\r\nnight, the clock had not struck eleven, when I heard a loud cry of\r\n‘Stop thief!’ A highwayman had attacked a post-chaise in Piccadilly,\r\nwithin fifty yards of this house: the fellow was pursued, rode over the\r\nwatchman, almost killed him, and escaped.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Robbing is the only thing that goes on with any vivacity, though my\r\nfriend Mr. MᶜLean is hanged. The first Sunday after his condemnation,\r\nthree thousand people went to see him; he fainted away twice with the\r\nheat of his cell. You can’t conceive the ridiculous rage there is of\r\ngoing to Newgate.”\r\n\r\nEven children were not exempt. A girl of fourteen, convicted for\r\nwhite-washing farthings to make them appear like sixpences, was\r\ncondemned to be burnt, and was only reprieved when she was actually at\r\nthe stake.\r\n\r\nNever was more stir created about the fate of a malefactor at Tyburn\r\nthan in the celebrated case of Dr. Dodd. A preacher of remarkable\r\neloquence, who attracted crowds to listen to him, a man who moved in\r\nthe highest Society and was known to everybody, he lived, like so\r\nmany others of his day, far above his means, and was constantly in\r\npecuniary embarrassment. The episode which brought him to the gallows\r\nwas the forgery of the name of the Earl of Chesterfield—the godson and\r\nsuccessor of the old beau—to a bond for about £4000.\r\n\r\nDodd needed the money badly, and had, as subsequent events showed,\r\nevery expectation of receiving it before the bill became due. He\r\nflattered himself in the belief that the transaction would be safely\r\nclosed, and the bond returned and destroyed before the forged signature\r\ncould come to the knowledge of the Earl. It was only the Earl’s credit,\r\nwhich was better than his own, that he was borrowing. However, some\r\nevil mischance—perhaps the largeness of the amount—led the discounter\r\nto pursue inquiries, in the course of which he called on Lord\r\nChesterfield. The signature was immediately disavowed, and Dr. Dodd\r\nclapt into Newgate.\r\n\r\nHe promised restitution; and, in fact, all but a few insignificant\r\nhundreds were paid. Society was in arms. Chesterfield was blamed for\r\nprosecuting. Horace Walpole speaks of Dr. Dodd’s eloquence, and pities\r\nhis fate. Dr. Johnson wrote in his favour. No subject was ever more\r\nenthusiastically discussed by the fashionable throng in Hyde Park.\r\nThe populace were in his favour, for it was felt that the money in\r\nrepayment was extorted by false pretences. Hanging after restitution\r\nwas considered too much for the crime.\r\n\r\nLetters appeared in the newspapers. A special petition from the\r\ninhabitants of the City of Westminster was drawn up for presentation\r\nto the King, which measured thirty-six yards, and contained 23,000\r\nsignatures, seeking the pardon of the unfortunate man. None of the\r\ngreat contemporary correspondences omits a discussion of the trial and\r\nsentence.\r\n\r\nBut all these efforts were of no avail. George III. obstinately\r\nrefused a pardon. If the heavens should fall, Dr. Dodd should still\r\nhang; and, deaf to all appeals, he sent him to his doom. The execution\r\nwas carried out on the morning of 27th June 1777. Dr. Dodd’s friends\r\nprocured a mourning-coach, in which the condemned man was allowed to\r\ndrive to Tyburn in place of the usual cart. The _Morning Post and Daily\r\nAdvertiser_ says of the last scene:\r\n\r\n“The populace seemed universally affected at his fate, and even\r\n_Jack Ketch_ himself was in tears.... The concourse of people who\r\nattended the execution of the two malefactors yesterday at Tyburn was\r\nincredible; it is conjectured that no less than 500,000 people were\r\nassembled on the occasion, between Newgate and the place of execution.”\r\n\r\nHorace Walpole mentions the fact that two thousand soldiers were kept\r\nat drill in Hyde Park during the execution, in case of an attempt at\r\nrescue. It is related that Dr. Dodd prayed fervently, that twice he\r\nchanged his cap when standing beneath the beam, and that the long\r\ndelay, before he was sent into eternity, incensed the baser part of the\r\nghouls, gathered round to take their delight in seeing a man hang.\r\n\r\nWhat cheerful times those were!\r\n\r\nAnother class of criminal of earlier date was Mrs. Catherine Hayes,\r\nwho in 1726 murdered her husband in circumstances of the grossest\r\nbrutality. His head was hacked off, the body cut up, and efforts\r\nmade to hide all traces of the crime by burying the mangled remains\r\nin a pond at Marylebone. They were discovered, and the woman’s two\r\naccomplices were hanged. A more dreadful fate was reserved for herself.\r\nShe was conveyed to Tyburn, and was there burnt alive at the stake.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Execution of Catherine Hayes at Tyburn.\r\n\r\n_From a Print in the “Tyburn Chronicle.”_]\r\n\r\nAccording to the law of the period, those committed for murder and\r\n“petty treason” were to be hanged and afterwards burnt at the gallows.\r\nThe hangman did his work, but the mob of ruffians which surged around\r\ngot out of all control, and so timoured the officer of the law that\r\nthe wretched woman was cut down while still alive and conscious, and\r\ntaken to the stake. The people yelled and shrieked, and tried to force\r\ntheir way towards the blazing pile, and generally behaved in such an\r\nuproarious manner that the horrors of death were rendered a hundredfold\r\nmore hideous by their frantic conduct.\r\n\r\nThe most astounding thing about this revolting scene is, that the\r\nburning alive of a woman at the stake took place in the presumedly\r\ncivilised days of George the First, and in the last year of his reign.\r\n\r\nSociety at the commencement of the eighteenth century still read\r\nlittle, and ignorance fed and thrived on the thrilling details of the\r\ncareers of daring highwaymen. Persons of decent reputation vied with\r\none another to have the latest chat with the manacled prisoners. “His\r\nLast Dying Speech and Confession” was shouted about the streets, and\r\nthe broadside sold in thousands. People still flocked to an execution\r\nas to an entertaining show.\r\n\r\nIt is just as well not to have lived in those gross times. How\r\ndifferent has public sympathy and sentiment grown in the comparatively\r\nshort space of a century. Thackeray was right when he wrote of Tyburn:\r\n\r\n“Were a man brought to die there now, the windows would be closed, and\r\nthe inhabitants would keep their houses in sickening horror. A hundred\r\nyears ago people crowded there to see the last act of a highwayman’s\r\nlife, and made jokes of it. Swift laughed at him, cruelly advised him\r\nto provide a holland shirt and a white cap, crowned with a crimson or\r\nblack ribbon, for his exit, to mount the cart cheerfully, shaking hands\r\nwith the hangman, and so farewell; or Gay wrote his most delightful\r\nballads, and then made merry over his hero.”\r\n\r\nThe last man hanged at Tyburn was John Austin on 7th November 1783,\r\nfor robbery and unlawful wounding, and on the following 9th December,\r\nthe first public execution outside Newgate took place. The _Morning\r\nChronicle_ of that day, in relating the event, added the remark:\r\n\r\n“The saving to the State and to individuals from the new method of\r\nexecuting criminals is immense. Many indigent families will feel\r\nthe good effects of preventing the loss of a day. No longer will\r\nthoughtless youth neglect their employment to attend Tyburn executions,\r\nwhere too many have become converts to bad practices.”\r\n\r\nIndeed, the rascality attending these scenes almost passes belief.\r\nA Tyburn execution, especially if a “fashionable” one, at which the\r\nbetter—or at least wealthier—class gathered, was an occasion for the\r\nassembling of all the pickpockets, watch-snatchers, and bad characters\r\nof the town, who plied their skill busily while attention was directed\r\nupon the expiring struggles and groans of the poor wretch swinging\r\nfrom the tree. One Francis Grey, as he stood on the scaffold, actually\r\nexhorted the crowd around him to give up their evil ways, for he saw\r\nmany bad men there, and bad deeds had never brought him happiness.\r\n\r\nIn closing the ghastly story of Tyburn Tree, it is interesting to note\r\nthat _The Times_ of 9th May 1860 printed a letter from Mr. A. J. B.\r\nBeresford-Hope, relating that outside the garden of Arklow House, at\r\nthe extreme angle of Edgware Road, a pipe was being repaired, and many\r\nhuman bones were dug up, doubtless relics of the bodies buried near\r\nthe Tyburn gallows. Earlier in the nineteenth century, when digging\r\nfoundations for houses in Connaught Place, workmen had come on human\r\nremains, a whole cartload having been removed. Lady Battersea tells\r\nme no trace, whatever, of a burial place was found under their house\r\nopposite the Marble Arch when digging the drains about 1880.\r\n\r\nIn the later executions, the scaffold, the site of which had been\r\nchanged, was a movable erection, consisting of two uprights and a\r\ncross beam. It was only put up on the morning of execution across the\r\nroadway, opposite the house at the corner of Upper Bryanston Street and\r\nthe Edgware Road, wherein the gibbet was kept when not in use.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the timber of the famous gallows, beneath which so many\r\nhundreds—one might almost say thousands—of malefactors made a painful\r\nexit from this world, was sold to a carpenter, and used by him in\r\nmaking stands for beer-butts for the cellars of an alehouse hard by.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2] _Pappe with a Hatchet._\r\n\r\n[3] _The Kingdomes Intelligencer of the Affairs now in agitation in\r\nEngland._ From Monday, 28th January, to Monday, 4th Feb. 1661.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nNINETEENTH-CENTURY FRAGMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Hyde Park was the centre of a far wider evolution than that\r\nwhich has been already noticed in eighteenth-century London. A new era\r\nhad dawned for Britain.\r\n\r\nThe power of colonisation—which to-day has attained the strength\r\nof Imperialism—had, after long infancy, developed into lusty youth\r\nclamouring for equal rights, for freedom, for independence.\r\n\r\nClive had fought and conquered at Plassey, Wolfe had won and died\r\nat Quebec. Wider issues were at stake, greater demands were made on\r\nEnglish politicians, who were confronted by problems such as had never\r\narisen in the world’s history.\r\n\r\nIn England itself the revival of literature continued, in spite of\r\nthe thrust of the _Westminster Gazette_ at the Macaronis. Brilliant\r\norators, wily statesmen, long-headed, far-sighted diplomatists\r\nsprang to the front to devote their talents and their lives to these\r\nfar-reaching questions.\r\n\r\nIn this awakened national life, Hyde Park, too, had its place. It was\r\nnot merely a central point for the gathering of the fashionable and\r\nthe frivolous. Many statesmen strolled thither, met one another and\r\nexchanged views, sometimes after lively debates in the House, seeking\r\nin the charm of its greenery and shade the solution of many a knotty\r\nproblem. There, again, they found opportunities for obtaining influence\r\nin carrying through momentous measures.\r\n\r\nWe have seen Pitt on his little Welsh pony. In contrast to his simple\r\nfigure, John Wilkes lolled in his gaudy equipage, ogling fair ladies,\r\nand posing as a hero of the people. Such appearances multiplied as the\r\nyears went on.\r\n\r\nThere, Burke was often to be seen strolling alone, or chatting with a\r\nfriend after a brilliant speech on a leading topic of the day. There,\r\nWindham took an early morning ride and watched the Guards at drill, or\r\njoined the fashionable throng later in the day.\r\n\r\nThere, the first Lord Holland was wont to alight from his carriage,\r\nand let it follow him as he wended his way from Whitehall to Holland\r\nHouse, talking as he went, to his friends. There, also, William\r\nWilberforce held conversation when he lived at Gore House, and those\r\nwho were privileged to be at his famous gatherings would take a turn\r\nthrough the Park, discussing that wonderful personality and his aims.\r\nThere, Charles James Fox, Sheridan, the younger Pitt, and many others\r\nwere to be seen day by day, but it was by no means with men alone that\r\npolitical issues of the time rested.\r\n\r\nFair ladies attached great importance to their daily visit to the\r\nPark. It was their battlefield, where they must—for their own peace of\r\nmind—mentally slay some rival, lay siege to some masculine stronghold,\r\nand render resistance useless. And be sure the gossips of the Georges\r\nhad much to say about such actresses as Mrs. Oldfield, Mrs. Pritchard,\r\nPeg Woffington, Mrs. Clive, Mrs. Cibber, Mrs. Jordan, or such beauties\r\nas Lady Sarah Lennox, Georgiana Duchess of Devonshire, and Lady\r\nElizabeth Foster, all of whom were familiar figures in the Park.\r\n\r\nIn that daily rendezvous in Hyde Park astute statesmen were coerced,\r\nruled, and graciously governed by the feminine mind, and more power was\r\nacquired by Society ladies in those casual meetings than probably in\r\nany other way. Nowadays, women’s wise influence is chiefly brought to\r\nbear on public and political matters over the teacups—a pleasant social\r\nfunction which at that time had scarcely been established.\r\n\r\nTo what extent this feminine influence existed, and could be called\r\nupon on a moment’s notice, is shown in the following note, found in\r\nVere Foster’s _Two Duchesses of Devonshire_. It was written by Charles\r\nJames Fox from the House of Commons to the beautiful Georgiana Duchess\r\nof Devonshire in 1805, about a year before the death of both writer and\r\nrecipient:\r\n\r\n  “Pray speak to everybody you can to come down or we shall be lost on\r\n  the Slave Trade. Morpeth, Ossulton, Ld. A. H., Ld. H. Petty all away.\r\n  Pray, pray send anybody you see.\r\n\r\n    “Yours\r\n      C. J. F.”\r\n  “1/2 past seven. H. of C.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Camp in Hyde Park during the Gordon Riots, 1780.\r\n\r\n_From a Print in the Crace Collection, British Museum._]\r\n\r\nWar with America gave zest to military affairs. Hyde Park was the\r\nnursery for new regiments. Ladies, including the Duchess of Devonshire,\r\nthe Duchess of Beaufort, and Lady Sutton, appeared in a feminised\r\nedition of the military garb of their respective husbands’ commands.\r\nNear the site of Cumberland Gate targets were set up for ball practice,\r\nand it is not many years since the last of the stones used were removed.\r\n\r\nTyburn was already doomed, not because hanging had ceased to be a\r\nfashionable entertainment, but because all sorts and conditions of men\r\nattending the executions invaded the “Arcadia” of the _beau monde_, and\r\nrendered it hideous to them.\r\n\r\nIn 1783 the gallows were swept away.\r\n\r\nDuring those final scenes around the “triple tree” a romantic figure\r\nhad passed across the horizon of Hyde Park, who, but for an attack of\r\nfever in Newgate, to which he succumbed, might also have ended his days\r\nat the gallows. The peculiar personality of Lord George Gordon had\r\nbeen played out, and the Gordon Riots, which Dickens so graphically\r\ndescribes in _Barnaby Rudge_, had landed their instigator in gaol.\r\nLord George had been a familiar frequenter of the Park, where he drove\r\nhis own coach, though his income only reached the modest sum of £600 a\r\nyear. The desire to be possessed of a coach was as strong, apparently,\r\nin England in those days as it is in Italy or Spain to-day, where folk\r\nwill live on beans and olives, and save their money to drive behind a\r\npair of horses.\r\n\r\nWhen the riots broke out a camp was again formed in Hyde Park. It\r\nwas much needed, for, after the burning of Lord Mansfield’s house in\r\nBloomsbury Square, the nobility in Mayfair would not remain in their\r\nhomes at night; and Wraxall tells us that the Duchess of Devonshire for\r\nmany nights left her mansion in Piccadilly, and slept on a sofa at the\r\nhouse of Lord Clermont in Berkeley Square.\r\n\r\nBut these riots were quickly subdued, and Hyde Park again became the\r\nscene of gaiety, festivity, and frivolity, bordered on the east and\r\nsouth by its stately mansions, where magnificent entertainments were\r\ngiven, and the owners held small courts of their own. One of these—on\r\nthe site of Dorchester House, the present American Embassy—belonged to\r\nLord Milton, who was afterwards made Earl of Dorchester. He was famous\r\nfor his regal hospitality, but so exclusive was the circle of friends\r\nadmitted to its stately halls, that the house was known among the\r\nexcluded ones as “Milton’s Paradise Lost.” Its owner, who was a man of\r\ngreat intellect, but reserved and haughty, was one of the most familiar\r\nfigures in the Park.\r\n\r\nIt is passing strange that an American, in the charming person of Mr.\r\nWhitelaw Reid, should dispense royal hospitality on the very edge of\r\nOld Tyburn Lane.\r\n\r\nAnother remarkable personage, contemporary with Lord Milton, was Lord\r\nDeerhurst, the son of Lady Coventry (Miss Gunning). Although quite\r\nblind through a shooting accident, he would ride full gallop in Rotten\r\nRow. Once he cannoned into another horseman, but after a few days’ rest\r\nhe again appeared in the saddle as reckless as ever.\r\n\r\nYet another strange personage to be seen was the Duke of Queensberry,\r\nknown as “old Q,” whose worldliness and licentiousness in an era by\r\nno means strict in morals have given his name a sinister notoriety. He\r\nsurvived to the venerable age of eighty-six, sitting out to the last\r\non his balcony in Piccadilly watching the gay world passing into the\r\nPark, a spectacle which caused Leigh Hunt to “wonder at the longevity\r\nof his dissipation and the prosperity of his worthlessness.” In his\r\ndrawing-room in Piccadilly he enacted his famous reproduction of the\r\nscene on Mount Ida, with three of the most beautiful women in London to\r\nrepresent the goddesses—“in the same dress, so to speak,” as Mr. Street\r\nso tactfully puts it[4]—and himself as Paris to award the apple.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales had already broken out into all sorts of\r\nextravagance, and his appearances in the Park were occasions for his\r\ngreatest displays. His mock marriage with Mrs. Fitzherbert at Carlton\r\nHouse, and their legal marriage in her own home in Park Street, Park\r\nLane, near Hereford Gardens, were the talk of the day, and they were,\r\nbefore and after, constantly to be seen together in the Park. In the\r\nwinter before this marriage there was again skating on the Serpentine,\r\nand the gay Prince appeared in a fur coat which cost £800, and a\r\nlarge black muff. In fact, one might devote a whole volume to the\r\nextravagance indulged in by this young man, in order that he might\r\nfigure loudly in his favourite London resort.\r\n\r\nReviews and prize-fights were great attractions in the Parks. Gay\r\nladies rode in Rotten Row, among whom a well-known personality was\r\nthe wonderful Marchioness of Salisbury, who was seen there daily for\r\nso many years, and was also famous for her support of Pitt in his\r\nelections, while her rival, _the_ Duchess of Devonshire, canvassed for\r\nFox.\r\n\r\nIt was a critical time for England: wars without, the dark shadow\r\nof insanity resting on the Sovereign, men striving for first place\r\nin the realm; and the nation hailed with true rejoicing the news of\r\nKing George III.’s recovery in 1789. London was one great blaze of\r\nilluminations from end to end. The monarch was at Kew, but the Queen\r\nand Princesses drove up to town to see the displays, making Apsley\r\nHouse their headquarters, and returning home very late at night. Hyde\r\nPark took no small share in these festivities.\r\n\r\nSoon after the marriage of Caroline of Brunswick with the Prince of\r\nWales, she appeared in the Park and was the object of great admiration,\r\nwhich, in spite of all her faults, was accorded to her by the English\r\npublic until the end of her life. So far as a selfish man can love,\r\nthe object of the Prince’s affection was Mrs. Fitzherbert, and he only\r\nsubmitted to the marriage with his cousin in order to pay his debts,\r\nfor the Princess brought with her a dowry of a million sterling.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all his efforts, the Prince was about this time eclipsed in\r\nHyde Park, for a man, who largely owed his position to Royal favour,\r\noutstripped him in the elegance and costliness of his dress. This was\r\nBeau Brummel, the son of one of the Whitehall Secretaries. His aunt,\r\nMrs. Searle, lived as gate-keeper of the Green Park, inhabiting a\r\nlittle cottage in a small enclosure in which she kept cows. This good\r\nbody often received visits from the Princes and Princesses, and it\r\nwas here that the Prince Regent met the youthful Brummel, and was so\r\nattracted by him that he secured for him a commission in the army. Hyde\r\nPark saw much of this dandy in his finery, with his mincing ways and\r\nabsurd conceits. He scored heavily for a time, but was destined to end\r\nhis days in poverty.\r\n\r\nIn 1800, George III. was reviewing the Grenadier Guards in the Park,\r\nwhen a musket-ball entered the leg of a gentleman standing a few yards\r\nfrom him, piercing his thigh. It was subsequently found that the ball\r\nhad gone through the coat of a Frenchman, and also struck a boy on the\r\nway. His Majesty remained where he was, and laughed the matter off.\r\nIt was, however, thought to be an attempt on his life—a true surmise\r\nevidently, for a pistol was fired at him in the theatre the same\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nAfter the overdressing of earlier days, with a superabundance of stuffs\r\nand ruffs, fashion had reduced the feminine attire to a sparseness that\r\nwas indecent, and brought indignant denunciation from both the Pope and\r\nthe Protestant clergy. The last year of the eighteenth century was a\r\ndistinguished one in Hyde Park, on account of the number of beautiful\r\nwomen to be seen driving there. Many of them handled the ribbons in\r\nfine form, chief in this art being the Marchioness of Donegall and\r\nthe Countess of Mansfield. A figure, long to adorn the Park with his\r\npresence, was Sir Arthur Wellesley. He was a faithful lover of the\r\nRow and those more secluded roads to the west and north, where he\r\ngenerally rode a beautiful Arab horse, and these graceful animals\r\nbecame the vogue. Humble heroes as well were brought to mind, for the\r\nKing granted a little cottage near the Royal Humane Society’s House—not\r\nthe present one, which was opened later by Sir Arthur Wellesley when\r\nDuke of Wellington—to Mrs. Sims, an unfortunate woman who had lost all\r\nher six sons in battle.\r\n\r\nStrutt, writing in his _Sports and Pastimes_ in 1801, says:\r\n\r\n“I have seen, some years back, when the Serpentine River in Hyde Park\r\nwas frozen over, four gentlemen there dance, if I may be allowed the\r\nexpression, a double minuet in skates with as much ease, and I think\r\nmore elegance, than in a ballroom; others again, by turning and winding\r\nwith much adroitness, have already in succession described upon the ice\r\nthe form of all the letters of the alphabet.”\r\n\r\nMoreover, that cosmopolitan touch, in which all Britons rejoice so long\r\nas it does not encroach, began to show itself, and in 1803, the exiled\r\nBourbon Princes were often to be seem among the throngs in the Park,\r\nand they were present at a review held by the King, to which the Queen\r\nand Princesses also came, as well as six of the Princes. It was a most\r\nbrilliant affair, and attracted crowds.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Winter Amusements.\r\n  _From a Print in Crace Collection, British Museum._]\r\n\r\nThose early nineteenth-century days were full of amusing\r\neccentricities. The springs in Hyde Park were much sought after by\r\npeople for bathing, others for drinking, and on Sundays a strange\r\nscientist and doctor, who resided in Mount Street, Martin van Butchell\r\nby name, used to attend, to distribute water from one of them. He was a\r\nwell-known character, who rode daily among the throng on a white pony\r\nwith a long, flowing tail, and this poor beast used at times to be\r\npainted whatever colour his master fancied. The advertisements of this\r\nself-advertising quack in the contemporary newspapers are most amusing.\r\n\r\nMalcolm, in his _Review of Society in 1807_, says:\r\n\r\n“Other amusements of the great consist in riding through Hyde Park: the\r\nladies in their coaches, and the gentlemen on horseback in an adjoining\r\nroad. He that would judge of the population of London should attend in\r\nthe Park on any Sunday at three o’clock, from February till May; he\r\nmust be astonished at the sight. The coaches, the horses, the populace\r\nof every rank who toil against the bleak East winds, are wonderfully\r\nnumerous. Nor should he omit a visit to Kensington Gardens in May, to\r\nview the beautiful pedestrians that form our fashionable world: or a\r\nwinter excursion to the Serpentine River and the Canal in St. James’s\r\nPark, where numbers skait, or attempt to skait.”\r\n\r\nIn 1808 it was suggested in Parliament that houses should be built in\r\nHyde Park itself, but the proposal was quickly vetoed, for year by year\r\nit became more and more popular as a public rendezvous. The Prince of\r\nWales came dashing down the Row in his tilbury, with his groom by his\r\nside, displaying a lack of dignity that shocked many people. The aged\r\nand infirm enjoyed a pleasant drive in the Park. Dr. Burney describes\r\nhis daily outing after he was paralysed, as “an old lady’s drive about\r\nHyde Park,” while it was the scene of a pathetic incident in the life\r\nof Princess Caroline and her daughter.\r\n\r\nForbidden to hold intercourse with her only child—the Princess\r\nCharlotte—and refused admittance at Windsor, Princess Caroline was one\r\nday driving, when she saw her daughter’s carriage going in another\r\ndirection. She bade her coachman follow, and finally, in Hyde Park,\r\novertook Princess Charlotte near the Serpentine. The carriages drew\r\nup side by side, the Royal occupants leaned over, kissed each other,\r\nand exchanged some cherished words of conversation. A crowd gathered,\r\nbut no matter—it was a sympathetic English crowd, parents and children\r\nthemselves, who would have defended the mother and daughter had need\r\narisen.\r\n\r\nJust about this period a Mrs. Browne came to London, lovely and to be\r\npitied. She attracted the attention of the remarkable Lord Petersham.\r\nHenceforth this nobleman appeared in Hyde Park indicating to the world\r\nthe trend his affections had taken by his brown hat and clothes, brown\r\ncoach, brown horses, brown liveries, even to the servants’ hats.\r\n\r\nLord Petersham’s rival in eccentricity was a wonderful, wealthy magnate\r\nfrom Antigua. Society named him _Diamond_ Coates, or _Romeo_ Coates;\r\nthe latter name arose from his passion for acting, and especially his\r\nperformance as Romeo. His turn-out in the Park was most remarkable.\r\nDrawn by perfect horse-flesh, he posed in a luxurious carriage shaped\r\nlike a shell,—altogether a most imposing and artistic affair,—but he\r\nspoilt the effect, and displayed the _nouveau riche_, by sticking his\r\nridiculous crest all over his belongings. Nevertheless, he was the pet\r\nof fashion for some time.\r\n\r\nEccentricity was the rage. Each tried to outvie his neighbour in\r\nattracting attention. Another remarkable sight was the Persian\r\nAmbassador, who, mounted on a mule, was to be seen riding daily in the\r\nRow. A peculiarity of his attire was the extreme width of his trousers,\r\nwhich the wind used to inflate as he galloped along, rendering him\r\na ludicrous spectacle, more fit for a circus than the dull skies of\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nThe fall of Napoleon and his exile to Elba played an important part in\r\nHyde Park’s doings, and the year 1814 was unequalled in Georgian days\r\nfor the pageantry displayed in its precincts. The spring was marked by\r\nthe procession of the exiled Bourbon, Louis XVIII., returning in full\r\nstate to take possession of the throne of France. The Prince Regent\r\nhad gone out from London to meet him on his way from Hartwell House,\r\nin Buckinghamshire, where he had spent his exiled days, and with all\r\nceremonial possible conducted him to the metropolis, whence he set out\r\nfor France.\r\n\r\nThe summer was filled with peace festivities. The Emperor of Russia,\r\nthe King of Prussia, and some of the Prussian Generals—Blucher among\r\nthem—visited England, and were in the Park on many occasions. The\r\nSunday crowd went mad at seeing them; in fact, many casualties were\r\ncaused in the excitement when they were on their way to Kensington.\r\nThe following Sunday a great review was held—the most brilliant ever\r\nwitnessed—but the culmination of the festivities was the Great Fair.\r\n\r\nCommencing on 31st July, 1814, no amusement was lacking, the chief show\r\nbeing a miniature naval engagement on the Serpentine. Extravagance,\r\nhowever, seems to have reigned supreme. During the week the fair lasted\r\nit cost the country £40,000.\r\n\r\nThe “Reminiscences” of Captain Gronow give many details of this time.\r\nA group of dandies was always to be found in the gay society of the\r\nPrince Regent, his chief friends being Beau Brummel, the Duke of\r\nArgyll, Lord Worcester, Lord Alvanley, Lord Foley, and others.\r\n\r\nThe most beautiful ladies were the Duchess of Rutland, the Duchess\r\nof Gordon, the Duchess of Bedford, and the Duchess of Argyll; Lady\r\nCowper,—afterwards Lady Palmerston,—and the lovely daughters of the\r\nMarquis of Anglesea. Lady Cowper inherited her mother’s talent as a\r\nleader of Society—especially political Society,—while other brilliant\r\nhostesses were Lady Castlereagh, the Countess of Jersey, Lady Sefton,\r\nPrincess Esterhazy, and the Countess Lieven.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Jubilee Fair in Hyde Park in 1814. After the fall of\r\nNapoleon.\r\n\r\n_From a Print in the Crace Collection, British Museum._]\r\n\r\nIt was a distinguished gathering still that was seen in Hyde Park\r\nat five o’clock in the afternoons, the ladies driving in their\r\n_vis-à-vis_, with their gorgeously embroidered hammer-cloths, be-wigged\r\ncoachmen and resplendent footmen, while the dandies rode their smart\r\nhorses and bedecked themselves with blue coats, leather breeches,\r\ntop-boots, and wonderful stiff white cravats. To these men Beau\r\nBrummel was the motive power, the beginning and the end of their\r\nexistence, and Brummel’s tailor was only second to the beau himself.\r\n\r\nTruly Hyde Park has an unparalleled record. For four hundred years the\r\nmakers of history, politicians, beauty, nobility, bravery—and knavery,\r\nalas!—have all tendered homage to the charm of its acres, its noble\r\ntrees, its grassy sward. Generation after generation has proclaimed\r\nlove for it; and now, indeed, what would the babies and the beauties do\r\nwithout the famous stretch from Marble Arch to Piccadilly?\r\n\r\nBut it is the fate of humanity that in the gayest scenes of life dark\r\nTragedy will thrust her hand, and in the midst of this wonderful\r\nassembly in 1816 spread the news that Harriet Westbrook, the wife of\r\nthe poet Shelley, had committed suicide in the Serpentine.\r\n\r\nFifty years later—to make a wide digression—Mrs. Jane Welsh Carlyle\r\nwent for a drive in Hyde Park, entering at Queen’s Gate, where she\r\nalighted and took her little dog for a run. After returning to the\r\ncarriage, she drove to a quiet place on the Tyburnia side of the Park,\r\nand the dog was put out again, but opposite Stanhope Place it was\r\nknocked over by a passing brougham. Mrs. Carlyle and the occupant of\r\nthe other brougham alighted, and Mrs. Carlyle returned to her carriage\r\nwith the dog, after which the coachman heard nothing but a slight\r\nwhimper from the animal. After driving round the Park again, he was\r\nsurprised at receiving no orders, and seeing his mistress in exactly\r\nthe same posture as he had observed her some distance back, he asked a\r\nlady to look in, who found that Mrs. Carlyle had passed away.\r\n\r\nWhether the tragedy of Shelley’s wife, and others of like kind, gave\r\nSociety a distaste for the vicinity of the Serpentine, history does\r\nnot say, but the drive from Apsley House to Cumberland Gate became\r\nthe fashionable quarter. The four-rowed belt of walnut-trees had been\r\nremoved some time before, and thus the road was considerably widened,\r\nbut it was commonly crowded to excess. There were already evidences\r\nof the Man in the Street asserting his claim to this former Royal\r\npreserve, not so much on week days as on Sundays, and Greville tells\r\nus of the Duchess of Cambridge being mobbed to her very door, and so\r\nterrified that she almost fainted. Moreover, on such occasions as the\r\nFair in 1814, the Coronation of George IV., and also the severe winters\r\nof 1820 and 1821, the populace reigned supreme, and Society was not by\r\nany means a mighty factor in Hyde Park.\r\n\r\nIt was during this migration to the east side of the Park and Park Lane\r\nin 1820 that two dozen chairs were first set out at Stanhope Gate, the\r\nforerunners of those 35,000 which are now to be found scattered about\r\non the grass and by the gravel-walks.\r\n\r\nFollowing closely on all the follies and shows in honour of George\r\nIV.’s Coronation came a most disgraceful scene. Caroline of Brunswick\r\ndied a few days after she received the refusal of the King to allow her\r\nto enjoy the rights of a Queen. According to her desire she was to be\r\nburied in Brunswick, and the body was to be embarked at Harwich. The\r\nmost direct route to that place would have been through the City, but,\r\nlest the citizens should wish to pay a last honour to the poor lady who\r\nhad passed such an unhappy life in their country, the order was given\r\nthat the body should be taken to Harwich by a circuitous route. The\r\nprocession was denuded of all dignity, and directions were given that\r\nit should turn up Church Street, Kensington, into the Bayswater Road.\r\nBut this the crowd, which numbered some thousands, would not permit. A\r\ncompany of Life Guards were sent for, but on their arrival they had to\r\ngive way before the dense mob.\r\n\r\nIt was finally decided to take the direct route to London. Orders were\r\nagain sent that the procession _must_ go round, and not through the\r\nCity. The crowd, however, prevented it from turning into Hyde Park or\r\nup Park Lane. But by a rapid manœuvre, part of the troops with the\r\nhearse forced their way into the Park, the gate was closed on the\r\nmob, and the body was taken at full gallop from Hyde Park Corner to\r\nthe Cumberland Gate. There the crowd forestalled them, and made all\r\nprogress impossible. Volleys were fired, and caused a temporary giving\r\nway, which enabled the procession to move towards Edgware Road, which\r\nwas also rendered impassable. All this went on in a terrible storm of\r\nwind and rain. After again firing on the populace, with the result that\r\nonly a little headway was made, and struggling for seven hours to obey\r\norders, those in command of the procession were forced to turn back\r\nand pass by Tyburn, Oxford Street, Holborn, and Drury Lane into the\r\nStrand, to the City. For thus giving way the officer in command lost\r\nhis commission.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to contemplate such an outrageous scene without a\r\nglance at that calm February morning, almost a century later, grey,\r\nstill and chilly, when from early dawn the population of London—even\r\nto the loafer and the noisy hooligan of the street—went with subdued\r\ndemeanour towards Hyde Park, there to stand, or sit in the trees for\r\nhours, until the funeral _cortége_ of Queen Victoria should pass\r\nthrough London. Even Nature herself seemed to hold her breath as the\r\nstately procession wound its way across the Park, on that very road\r\ntaken by the galloping horses eighty years before. Where a raging crowd\r\nhad run yelling with fury and indignation in Park Lane, a mass of\r\nthe people silently stood with bared heads—rows upon rows of them—as\r\nthat simple gun-carriage, with its regal burden, slowly filed by and\r\nvanished through the Marble Arch. Where the clattering hoofs of the\r\nsoldiers’ steeds at the funeral of Caroline of Brunswick had mixed with\r\nthe fury of the storm, sovereigns, princes, ambassadors, statesmen,\r\nsoldiers, and sailors, paced by with saddened mien, to the muffled\r\nstrains of military bands—a pageant as imposing as it was solemn.\r\n\r\nBut returning to those days of George IV., one notable figure at least\r\nmust not escape mention—the beautiful Lady Blessington. How beautiful\r\nshe was subsequent generations have learnt from the picture by Sir\r\nThomas Lawrence, now among the treasures of the Wallace Collection—a\r\nportrait which probably has been more often engraved than the work of\r\nany other British portrait-painter.\r\n\r\nShe is represented about eighteen years of age, when she had recently\r\ncome from Ireland, and in the first flush of her maidenhood; though,\r\nin fact, she had been forced into marriage when only fourteen with a\r\nworthless Captain Farmer, whom she left after three months.\r\n\r\nWhen a widow of twenty-nine she married the Earl of Blessington. From\r\ncomparative penury, she was raised at one step into the most luxurious\r\nand fashionable life of the time. Her equipage was considered one of\r\nthe most elegant in the Park, where she drove regularly until she went\r\nabroad with her husband.\r\n\r\nLord Blessington was a man of great wealth; but even his resources were\r\ntaxed to meet the excessive extravagance of his wife. After his death\r\nin 1829 her reign in the social life of London really began.\r\n\r\nPossessed at that time of a large fortune, she filled the house in\r\nSeamore Place with valuable furniture and _objets d’art_, and to her\r\nbrilliant salon flocked all the wit and genius of the day. The Duke of\r\nWellington, Bulwer Lytton, the two Disraelis, Lord Brougham, Sir Thomas\r\nLawrence, Thomas Moore, Sir E. Landseer, Landor, Maclise, Ainsworth,\r\nThackeray, and Lord John Russell were often to be found there. A\r\ncontemporary has left a graceful pen picture of her.\r\n\r\n“In a long library, lined alternately with splendidly bound books and\r\nmirrors, and with a deep window of the breadth of the room, opening\r\nupon Hyde Park, I found Lady Blessington alone. The picture to my eye\r\nas the door opened was a very lovely one; a woman of remarkable beauty\r\nhalf buried in a _fauteuil_ of yellow satin, reading by a magnificent\r\nlamp suspended from the centre of the arched ceiling, ... and a\r\ndelicate white hand relieved on the back of a book, to which the eye\r\nwas attracted by the blaze of its diamond rings.”\r\n\r\nLater Lady Blessington moved to Gore House, Kensington, where the great\r\nphilanthropist, William Wilberforce, had preceded her. It stood on the\r\nsite of the Albert Hall. Her entertainments were on a more lavish scale\r\nin this larger house, and troubles gathered round her.\r\n\r\nOf Count D’Orsay’s relations with Lady Blessington much was said at\r\nthe time. Married, by previous agreement with Lord Blessington, to his\r\ndaughter—a mere child, and the stepdaughter of the Countess—he found\r\nhis kindred spirit was really the child-wife’s stepmother.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LADY BLESSINGTON.]\r\n\r\nNo woman was more generous to those needing help, more modest over her\r\nbeneficent works, nor has any woman’s weak point been more fostered by\r\nFate than that of Lady Blessington. While the Earl lived, luxury and\r\nextravagance were showered upon her in every possible form. After his\r\ndeath she was under the influence of the Comte D’Orsay, a past master\r\nin the art of spending money. London went mad over the shape of a tie,\r\nif that shape was introduced by Comte D’Orsay. He was a man of genius,\r\na talented painter and sculptor, a brilliant conversationalist, of\r\nthe most prepossessing appearance. Generous to the many refugees of his\r\ncountry in London, extravagant in personal matters, he was in constant\r\ndebt. He possessed faultless taste, and was the best horseman, fencer,\r\nand shot in Society. The two were undoubtedly the most often quoted and\r\nbest-known figures of social life and the Park in the early nineteenth\r\ncentury. They lived at the rate of thousands a year, and seldom had a\r\npenny. Lady Blessington struggled to pay D’Orsay’s debts and her own,\r\nand to keep things going; but at length she could struggle no longer.\r\nGore House was seized by the creditors, and its contents sold. In April\r\n1849 the couple fled to Paris, where within two months Lady Blessington\r\ndied in great poverty.\r\n\r\nLady Blessington was one of the first women to take up literature, and\r\nshe was most handsomely paid for her work; so well, indeed, that at\r\ntimes she was in affluence, and at others plunged into the verge of\r\nbankruptcy. It was a strange coincidence that Lady Blessington’s first\r\nwork described the ruin and selling up of a large establishment. Her\r\nwhole life was one long romance, as pathetic and lonely at times as it\r\nwas brilliant and splendid at others.\r\n\r\nA great innovation during the Waterloo period was the Achilles Statue,\r\nof which much was written, the pen of Bernal Osborne and many others\r\nfinding in it food for satire. It was the first nude statue erected in\r\nEngland, and shocked Society—none the less, to be sure, because it was\r\nthe tribute of the ladies of England to the heroic Wellington. The\r\nsubscribers protested that they were not consulted by Westmacott, the\r\nsculptor. An eccentric old Sheriff, who disported himself in Hyde Park,\r\nespecially expressed himself on the subject. People turned their backs\r\nand fled to Rotten Row again.\r\n\r\nThe high brick wall that had been first placed round the Park in the\r\nreign of Charles II., when Hamilton restored the deer, and had been\r\nrebuilt in 1726, was now removed, and an iron railing was put up in\r\nits place. This was the greatest blow that had as yet been struck\r\nagainst the comparative monopoly of Hyde Park by the aristocracy. The\r\nold Curds and Whey House also disappeared. The parks—and in fact the\r\nwhole of London—were still badly kept, and needed police supervision,\r\nand matters did not improve until the Police Act of 1829 was brought\r\ninto force by the efforts of Sir Robert Peel. In its first year the\r\nnew force numbered 3600 men; now the Metropolitan Police alone—not\r\nincluding the splendid body of City Constabulary—is over seventeen\r\nthousand strong.\r\n\r\nWhen William IV. succeeded his brother George IV. on the throne, Hyde\r\nPark was the only scene of display, and there the rejoicings were\r\nlimited to fireworks; but even these were mismanaged in some way, and\r\nseveral people were hurt by the falling rockets.\r\n\r\nThe King and Queen Adelaide used often to drive round the Serpentine.\r\nThe latter was never really popular, but King William won the sympathy\r\nof the people by his simplicity. This very homeliness, however, kept\r\nhis Ministers busy and anxious to know what fresh departure His\r\nMajesty was going to take. The Duke of Wellington must have often\r\nwished himself back at the head of his troops when negotiating for this\r\nirresponsible monarch.\r\n\r\nOne morning he informed the Duke that he would dine with him at Apsley\r\nHouse that evening.\r\n\r\nAt Apsley House all was bustle and scurry. Preparations for the\r\ndinner were at their busiest, the hour appointed had arrived, and the\r\nhousehold was in a turmoil, when, to the horror of everybody concerned,\r\na dusty, tired-out looking cavalcade came in sight, and proved to be\r\nthe two Kings returning from Windsor. The people all crowded to Hyde\r\nPark Corner, and the Duke rushed hatless to do his Sovereign honour.\r\nBut what could he have felt on finding that instead of the Kings being\r\ndressed in their best in honour of the feast, at least an hour must\r\nelapse before they could be even clean.\r\n\r\nIn 1831, during the agitation over the Reform Bill, the mob twice\r\nattacked Apsley House, and the second time broke all the windows. There\r\nwas scarcely a whole sheet of glass left, and what made it more painful\r\nstill, the Duke knew nothing of the anger of the populace, as he had\r\nfor several days scarcely left the bedside of his wife, who, when the\r\nattack took place, was actually dying. It was not until two hundred\r\npolice mustered that the rioters were dispersed. After this the Duke\r\nhad iron shutters placed at all the windows, and would never have them\r\nremoved, but they were taken down by his successor. Those now outside\r\nthe windows facing the Park are made of wood.\r\n\r\nThe enclosure of land from Hyde Park, and his attitude to the Reform\r\nBill and the Corn Laws, created a temporary unpopularity, but before\r\nlong he was again received with acclamation everywhere. The Iron Duke\r\nnever allowed himself to be carried away by a love of notoriety or\r\npopularity. One day, when he was returning to Apsley House by way of\r\nConstitution Hill, a large mob of admirers followed, cheering him. He\r\nrode calm and unmoved to the gate, where, wheeling round, he bowed\r\nsarcastically, and, silently pointing to his iron shutters, rode on to\r\nhis door.\r\n\r\nOn the accession of Queen Victoria a great Coronation Fair was held in\r\nHyde Park. The newspapers of the day give exhaustive accounts of it.\r\nOn the wide area lying between the Serpentine and Park Lane were to\r\nbe seen fat boys, living skeletons, giants, dwarfs, freaks of nature\r\nof all kinds. The acrobat, the conjurer, and wild beast shows were\r\nheld forth as attractions. Boats were placed on the Serpentine. Aunt\r\nSallies, roundabout swings, pony rides, fortune-tellers all helped to\r\ndraw not only Londoners, but their country cousins as well, to Hyde\r\nPark. Innumerable stalls and booths were erected for the purpose of\r\nselling refreshments and mementoes of the event, and although the fair\r\nwas only supposed to last two days it extended to four.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Festivities on the Ice, 1857.\r\n\r\n_From a Print in the “Illustrated London News,” after a Drawing by John\r\nLeech._]\r\n\r\nProbably up to that time no such crowd had ever assembled in Hyde Park,\r\nand it is recorded that it was orderly, jocular, fully determined to\r\nenjoy itself, evidently a typical London crowd, ever ready to abide by\r\nthe laws. Before the fair closed the Queen drove through the Park to\r\nsee it.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time, after the formation of the Serpentine, this fine\r\nsheet of water has afforded good sport to Londoners in severe winters.\r\nSuch a scene is handed down to us by the clever drawing of John Leech,\r\nwhich appeared in the _Illustrated London News_, together with an\r\nexcellent description of the festivities.\r\n\r\n“But it is in the Parks where Jack Frost is seen in all his glory—there\r\nhis admirers assemble in thousands; and, casting aside all distinctions\r\nof society, the Lord Muskovers and the Bill Flue-scrapers jostle each\r\nother on the ice as though they were really ‘dearly beloved brethren,’\r\nand not pomander and soot-balls. No bacchanalian revel more stirring\r\nand confused; and yet the only excitement is exercise. Stay! there are\r\nbrandy-balls, so highly recommended by the vendors that, at a loss for\r\nfurther eulogium, they fall back upon inquiry, and ask (of course,\r\nwithout asking for a reply), ‘If one warms you for a week, what will\r\ntwo do?’ Peppermint lozenges are in great request: and ginger-rock and\r\nkian drops are ‘hot in the mouth’ too. Roasting chestnuts crackling\r\nover glowing charcoal are irresistible to boys with cold hands and a\r\npenny. A happy fellow is this son of winter, for see how the rogue has\r\nkissed those pretty lips and dainty cheeks until they are red as summer\r\nroses. What would not those guardsmen give for the same privilege, even\r\nthough they should kiss through the wedding ring?”\r\n\r\nQueen Victoria and Prince Albert in later days used to take a daily\r\ndrive in Hyde Park. In 1840 a man named John Oxford shot at the\r\nQueen on Constitution Hill. Her Majesty fortunately escaped unhurt,\r\nso the drive was continued to Hyde Park Corner, and a visit paid to\r\nthe Duchess of Kent in Belgrave Square. The next day Her Majesty and\r\nthe Prince appeared as usual in the Park, and were the subject of\r\nremarkable popular demonstrations.\r\n\r\nVictorian Hyde Park we still have with us, and such changes as have\r\nbeen introduced, except in the early days of the reign, are within the\r\nmemory of some. Chief of these structurally is the Marble Arch. It has\r\nstood on its present site since 1851. The public entrance—for only the\r\nKing and Queen use the centre Arch—is still known as Cumberland Gate,\r\nso named after the Duke of Cumberland, whose ruthless massacres after\r\nCulloden won for him the soubriquet of “the Butcher.”\r\n\r\nCumberland Gate, of which an old drawing is here reproduced, was\r\nerected in 1744, largely at the expense of the residents of Cumberland\r\nPlace, of whose artistic taste little is to be said. It consisted of\r\nan ugly brick arch, with wooden gates below. Military executions took\r\nplace inside the Park just west of it. For long it was known as Tyburn\r\nGate, from the gallows which stood near by, so that its associations\r\nhave always been sanguinary. Old Cumberland Gate was taken down in\r\n1822, and in truth its disappearance was no loss.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD CUMBERLAND GATE. To the left of which military\r\nexecutions took place inside the Park.\r\n\r\n_From a Print in the Crace Collection, British Museum._]\r\n\r\nThe Marble Arch was originally placed in front of the chief entrance\r\nto Buckingham Palace by George IV. When the Palace was enlarged in\r\n1846 there was no place for the arch in the plans, and it was removed\r\npiecemeal in 1850, and re-erected at Tyburn corner, the Cumberland iron\r\ngates being taken down, and arranged to the right and left. The curious\r\nmay note the royal monogram of George IV. on the ironwork of the\r\nhandsome centre gates in the Arch. The Carrara marble even yet retains\r\nits whiteness, and has undergone little of the toning down to grey,\r\nwhich afflicts all our public buildings nearer the smoke centre.\r\n\r\nThe arch was adapted by Nash from the Arch of Constantine at Rome, and\r\ncost £80,000. It will no doubt be seen to better advantage when its\r\nisolation now in process is carried out. The idea originated with Mr.\r\nF. W. Speaight, to whom all honour is due, for wishing to relieve the\r\nmost congested bit of traffic in all London.\r\n\r\nMany people will remember when Decimus Burton’s beautiful triple arch\r\nat Hyde Park Corner was surmounted by Wyatt’s ridiculous equestrian\r\nstatue of the Duke of Wellington. It was happily removed when the\r\ngateway was set back and the roads replanned in 1882-83, and London\r\nlost a perpetual subject of merriment to foreigners. It had been\r\nintended that the Marble Arch, at the other corner of the Park, should\r\nbear a statue of George IV. mounted on horseback, by Sir Francis\r\nChantry, but this project was never carried out.\r\n\r\nOnly brief mention is here necessary of the Great Exhibition of 1851,\r\nheld in the vast glass building erected by Paxton for the purpose in\r\nHyde Park, which now constitutes the Crystal Palace at Sydenham. Though\r\nbut an enormous extension of Paxton’s design for a conservatory, built\r\nby him at Chatsworth for the flowering of the Victoria Lily, it was,\r\nby reason of its size and the material employed, considered one of the\r\nworld’s marvels. The Palace was nearly twice the breadth, and fully\r\nfour times the length, of St. Paul’s Cathedral. It covered twenty acres\r\nof park between Prince’s Gate and the Serpentine, and contained eight\r\nmiles of tables.\r\n\r\nA couple of most interesting letters written at the time of the opening\r\nof the Great Exhibition are contained in the recently published volumes\r\nof _Letters of Queen Victoria_. The first, bearing the date 2nd May\r\n1851, is from the Duchess of Gloucester, who wrote to Her Majesty:\r\n\r\n  “MY DEAREST VICTORIA,\r\n\r\n  “It is impossible to tell you how warmly I do participate in all\r\n  you must have felt yesterday, as well as dear Albert, at everything\r\n  having gone off so beautifully. After so much anxiety and the trouble\r\n  he has had, the joy must be the greater.\r\n\r\n  “The sight from my window was the gayest and most gratifying to\r\n  witness, and to me, who loves you so dearly as I do, made it the\r\n  more delightful. The good humour of all around, the fineness of the\r\n  day, the manner you were received in both going and coming from the\r\n  Exhibition, were quite perfect. Therefore what must it have been\r\n  inside the building?... It surpassed the Coronation in magnificence.”\r\n\r\nQueen Victoria on the next day writes to the King of the Belgians:\r\n\r\n  “MY DEAREST UNCLE,\r\n\r\n  “I wish you could have witnessed May 1st, 1851, the _greatest_ day\r\n  in our history, the most beautiful, and imposing, and touching\r\n  spectacle ever seen, and the triumph of my beloved Albert. Truly it\r\n  was astonishing, a fairy scene. Many cried, and all felt touched and\r\n  impressed with devotional feeling. It was the happiest, proudest day\r\n  of my life, and I can think of nothing else. Albert’s dearest name\r\n  is immortalised with this great conception, his own, and my own dear\r\n  country showed she was worthy of it. The triumph is immense.... You\r\n  will be astounded at the great work when you see it.... I feel so\r\n  proud and happy.”\r\n\r\nThe Queen’s closed carriage was lined with steel, and drove to the\r\nexhibition at a fast trot.\r\n\r\nAt the outset public opinion had been by no means unanimous in\r\napproving the scheme, and for a time the subscriptions hung fire, but\r\nthe advocacy and enthusiasm of the Prince Consort carried it through.\r\nIt was the first of the international shows which have since attained\r\nsuch colossal proportions. Although, in the hopes of its authors, the\r\nGreat Exhibition was to have inaugurated an era of universal peace, it\r\nwas soon followed by the Crimean War, and then the Indian Mutiny.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the glass building had been removed, it was proposed to\r\nerect a statue of Prince Albert on the spot; but, alas, before this was\r\nfinished the talented Prince was dead, and the statue then took the\r\nform of the Albert Memorial, which was placed to the west of where\r\nstood the Great Exhibition. The Memorial took some twenty years to\r\ncomplete. There is much good work in the sculptured detail; but happily\r\nthe idea of placing a gilded colossal figure in modern dress, under a\r\ncanopy not only too small for it architecturally, but too small even to\r\nkeep off the rain, has not been repeated.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1860 an event of great moment was a review of 20,000\r\nvolunteers by the Queen. Enthusiasm rose to a boundless height, and the\r\nfeelings of loyalty shown both by the volunteers and the crowd was so\r\noverwhelming that the Queen was overcome.\r\n\r\nIn these days of _ententes cordiales_ it is difficult to realise that\r\nuntil Queen Victoria and Prince Albert visited France in the ’forties,\r\nno reigning English sovereign had been the guest of our neighbours\r\nacross the Channel, since Henry VIII. held his wonderful pageant at the\r\nField of the Cloth of Gold. Further, until Louis XVIII., as already\r\nnoticed, passed through London on his way to take possession of the\r\nthrone of France in 1814, no King of France had been in England since\r\nthe days when the Black Prince led King John captive through the City.\r\n\r\nFrom that friendly visit of our young Queen dates the growing\r\ncordiality between the two countries. In 1855, amidst the spring\r\nbeauties of foliage and blossom, Napoleon III. and the Empress Eugénie\r\nmade a state procession through Hyde Park, driving round the Serpentine\r\nand out into Bayswater.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[4] _Ghosts of Piccadilly._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nDUELS IN THE PARK\r\n\r\n\r\nI have already referred to the custom of duelling—a phase of Society\r\nwhich became so prominent in the romance of Hyde Park, where many a\r\ntragic encounter and bitter quarrel were fought out, that it demands a\r\nshort chapter to itself.\r\n\r\nDuelling really came down to us as a relic of barbarism. It was among\r\nthe northern tribes of Europe that it originated, and was introduced\r\ninto England by the Normans under the “Trial by Combat.”\r\n\r\nFrom the Trial by Combat, which Shakespeare and Sir Walter Scott have\r\ndescribed so graphically, emanated the duel of later centuries, when\r\nthe bloody Wars of the Roses had swept away the last rays of chivalry.\r\nHenry VIII. had not long acquired the wide range of land known as the\r\nManor of Hyde, when two noblemen sought its solitary glades to decide a\r\nquarrel. A desperate duel was then fought between His Grace the Duke of\r\nB—— and Lord B——.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances were these:—\r\n\r\nA ball was in progress at a Minister’s house, when the Duke imagined\r\nthat Lord B—— had offered him a severe insult. He therefore sent him a\r\nchallenge worded as follows:\r\n\r\n“Convince me, then, that you are more of a gentleman than I have reason\r\nto believe, by meeting me near the first tree behind the lodge in Hyde\r\nPark, precisely at half an hour after five to-morrow morning.” The\r\nDuke added that he sent two swords for Lord B—— to choose from, and\r\nconcluded the note— “In the interim I wish your Lordship a good rest.”\r\n\r\nLord B—— accepted the challenge in a friendly strain. It is reported\r\nthat, his answer duly sent off, he visited several friends, when it\r\nwas remarked that as he was in such good spirits he had probably been\r\nsmiled upon by the Countess of Essex, whose favour he was anxious\r\nto gain. He and his second, General de Lee, set out early for the\r\nappointed spot in Hyde Park. There they had to wait for the Duke, who,\r\nhowever, shortly afterwards arrived, the seconds pairing the swords,\r\nand each one loading his adversaries’ pistols.\r\n\r\nBoth men had dressed themselves with the greatest care. The Duke wore\r\na scarlet coat, much betrimmed with gold lace; and his adversary a\r\ncrimson one, lavishly beautified with silver trimming; these they\r\ndoffed and handed to their seconds.\r\n\r\nThe two men fired, and Lord B—— wounded the ducal thumb, while on the\r\nsecond discharge the Duke also crippled his antagonist. They then drew\r\nswords, and charged each other with great determination. In the midst\r\nof the encounter Lord B—— tripped against a tuft of grass, but was\r\nup again before his adversary could take advantage of the opportunity\r\nafforded him. The seconds intervened, but nothing could appease the two\r\nangry men, and they fought at close quarters, and in parrying became\r\nlocked. When at last they succeeded in freeing their swords, the wrench\r\nwas so great that the weapons sprang out of their hands, and Lord\r\nB——’s is said to have risen six yards into the air. The weapons were\r\nrecovered, and the struggle began with renewed vigour. It continued\r\nwith even greater ferocity, both men receiving several wounds, until\r\nLord B—— ran his sword right through the Duke’s breast. Thus deprived\r\nof his weapon, he had to guard himself with his left arm, although\r\ntwo of his fingers were cut off. Thereupon His Grace, himself pierced\r\nthrough the body, plunged his own sword into Lord B—— just below the\r\nheart, and in that position they stood, pinned, or rather double\r\npinned, to one another without either being able to move. Lord B—— was\r\nthe first to stagger and fall; but his rival quickly followed suit.\r\nBoth expired before medical assistance could arrive.\r\n\r\nCould a more horrible scene be imagined. Men caught together by blades\r\nof steel, deadly hate in their souls and fire in their eyes.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that with the commencement of the Tudor period\r\nnew elements were to be seen at Court. Spain sent her Princess to wed\r\nin England, while Mary, the daughter of that same unhappy Catherine of\r\nArragon, married her cousin Philip II. of Spain. Southern courtiers\r\ncame in the royal trains. Spanish blood ran hot and quick in those\r\nrough and tumble days, rivalries deep and fierce raged in the hearts\r\nof the new English nobility. The rapier and dagger replaced the sword\r\nand buckler. Friends of one moment called each other out the next, and\r\nduring Elizabeth’s reign the custom of duelling was much increased. Ben\r\nJonson was imprisoned in 1593 for killing a brother-actor in a duel.\r\nHe was tried for manslaughter, to which he pleaded guilty; he was then\r\nreleased, after being branded with what the London people called “the\r\nTyburn T.”\r\n\r\nUnder James I. duelling was of constant occurrence. His courtiers, too,\r\nbrought fresh trouble, for, though the Scots are generally regarded\r\nas a phlegmatic race, cool, long-headed, and well able to look after\r\nthemselves, combats of this kind had long been a usual way of settling\r\nthe fierce tribal feuds between the Highland clans.\r\n\r\nThe following incident shows one of the many little affairs of that\r\nsort with which James I. had to deal, while it also reveals the fact\r\nthat, although we find no recorded duels in Hyde Park from the time\r\nof Bluff King Hal until 1693, that place was regarded as one of the\r\nhabitual spots for such frays.\r\n\r\n“Mary Middlemore, the favourite maid of Queen Anne of Denmark, was\r\neither reading or sewing in the Queen’s apartments at Greenwich\r\nPalace, when one of the King’s Scotch Gentlemen of the Bedchamber\r\nsurprised her, and carried off a top-knot from her hair, despite all\r\nher remonstrances, and henceforth wore it twisted in his hat-band.\r\nLord Herbert, who was panting for an opportunity of showing his\r\nknight-errantry, hearing the bitter complaints of the aggrieved\r\ndamsel, demanded the return of the top-knot from the Scotch lover, who\r\ncontumaciously refused to surrender it, on which Lord Herbert seized\r\nhim by the throat and almost strangled him. These antagonists were\r\ndragged asunder by their friends, lest they should incur the penalty of\r\nlosing their hands by striking in the Royal Palace. They exchanged a\r\n_cartel_ to fight unto death in Hyde Park, but the King and the Council\r\ntamed their pugnacity with the wholesome infliction of a month’s\r\nconfinement in the Tower.”\r\n\r\nDuring the Great Rebellion duelling became quite a rare occurrence,\r\nstill existing sufficiently, however, for Cromwell to pass an Act\r\nforbidding it. But under Charles II. it again became prevalent, and\r\nin spite of legislation against the custom, in 1712 it remained the\r\nfashion all through the Georgian period.\r\n\r\nNaturally, when ladies were so often the cause of these encounters,\r\nduels formed one of the topics of interesting gossip in the\r\ncorrespondence of the day. We find in 1693 a duel which had taken place\r\nin Hyde Park, described in a letter to the Countess of Rutland (Rutland\r\nMSS.) in these words: “... A quarrel happening between two Yorkshire\r\ngentlemen, Sir William Reresby and Mr. Moyser, they have decided it in\r\nHyde Park, being both wounded, but neither of them dangerously.”\r\n\r\nAmong the Harley papers at Welbeck Abbey, too, Sir Edward Harley,\r\nwriting to Lady Harley in the reign of Charles II., informs her that\r\n“upon a quarrel begun at a masquerade a duel was fought between Sir\r\nWinston Churchill’s son and Mr. Fenwick. Churchill is sore hurt.”\r\n\r\nNo record exists whether this was fought in Hyde Park, but a space\r\nnear the Ring was apparently a favourite spot, and Fielding in his\r\nnovel _Amelia_ lays the duel scene there. The seclusion of the place,\r\nthe early hour, the non-existence of our well regulated modern police,\r\nthe very difficulty of locomotion, and the dangerous character of the\r\nneighbourhood in the dusk and early dawn, all tended to make it easy\r\nfor the parties to keep their meeting a secret.\r\n\r\nIndeed, if one allows one’s imagination to run riot, there are even\r\nnow spots in Hyde Park which lend themselves for the “setting” of\r\nsuch meetings. Strolling on a November afternoon near the site of the\r\nRing, my thoughts wandering back through the centuries, I came to a\r\ngrassy slope facing a group of silver birch trees. Their beautiful\r\nforms stood in bold relief against a background of dark shrubs. The\r\nsetting sun—a red ball of fire—gave the haze, that adds so much to the\r\npicturesqueness of London, a hue that might have been the glow of a\r\nruddy sunrise. Raindrops of yesterday glittered on the grass like dew.\r\nThe sound of a distant carriage, and the little scene became peopled\r\nwith creatures of the imagination,—two figures, chatting lightly and\r\nstrolling to and fro among the trees; two others, pacing out a length,\r\ntalking gravely meanwhile, and then examining some small objects in\r\ntheir hands. And soon all was ready. Their companions were summoned,\r\nand took their stand, exchanging coats for pistols. I felt like the\r\nheroine in an old novel who has surprised _une affaire d’honneur_,\r\nand—expecting each second to hear the shot—was ready to turn and flee\r\nwith a thrill of horror, when the homely voices of the wild fowl on the\r\nSerpentine brought me back to reality and the twentieth century.\r\n\r\nThe fields behind Montague House (the present British Museum)\r\nespecially that known as “The Field of the Forty Footsteps,” Lincoln’s\r\nInn Fields, Covent Garden, Pall Mall, Bayswater Fields, Wimbledon\r\nCommon, Putney Heath, Battersea Fields, have all had the reputation\r\nof duelling grounds, and as late as 1783 the open space behind the\r\nFoundling Hospital was chosen for an affray.\r\n\r\nBut it was a common thing for disputants merely to turn out into the\r\nstreet, draw their swords, and settle the matter there and then. In\r\nfact, in the reigns of George I. and George II. a small difference in\r\na tavern assembly, a sudden flash of jealousy, were not even taken to\r\nthe street, but were quickly fought out in the house. Such was the case\r\nlater between Lord Byron and Mr. Chaworth, who fought with swords at\r\nthe “Star and Garter” in Pall Mall; while Brinsley Sheridan and Captain\r\nMatthews planned to fight in Hyde Park, but found too many people\r\nabout, so they retired to the Castle Tavern in Covent Garden.\r\n\r\nIn such combats people expended their sudden fits of passion, their\r\nlong pent-up hatred, or their bitter jealousy, and often a pet malice.\r\nContempt of death had a capable nurse in the ghastly Tyburn exhibitions.\r\n\r\nNor was it with one class of Society, nor with full-grown, responsible\r\nmen alone that this mania (for it can be called nothing less)\r\nexisted. It spread to mere boys, who called each other out for the\r\nslightest cause, in imitation of their elders—a danger which the\r\ntwentieth-century mother happily has not to fear for her sons. Laurence\r\nSterne’s father was shot in a duel arising from a dispute over a goose.\r\n\r\nThe challenge or _cartel_ took different forms; and it was supposed to\r\nbe good style to keep all arrangements within the strictest etiquette\r\nand politeness imaginable. This particular challenge in the highest\r\nSociety stated:\r\n\r\n1. The cause of offence.\r\n\r\n2. The reason why the cause should be noticed.\r\n\r\n3. The name of a friend.\r\n\r\n4. A request for an appointment of time and place.\r\n\r\nThe choice of seconds was an important matter, and any one who accepted\r\nthe office had a position of great responsibility. His first duty was\r\nto try and prevent the meeting, then to choose the ground, to charge\r\nthe pistols, to decide the distance the duellists should stand from\r\neach other, and when they called “All’s ready?” the second replied\r\n“All’s ready,” and at once dropped a handkerchief as token to begin.\r\n\r\nTwo surgeons generally attended; they were supposed to turn their backs\r\nin order not to see the actual duel, but to run forward as soon as they\r\nheard the shots, to render aid to the wounded.\r\n\r\nWhen George III. came to the throne duels could no longer be entered\r\ninto lightly, and became much more formal affairs, being arranged in\r\ndetail beforehand, with various points of etiquette. In many cases the\r\ncombatants tossed for first fire. Dr. Millingen states that there\r\nwere one hundred and seventy-two encounters fought during this reign;\r\nsixty-nine individuals killed and ninety-six wounded—forty-eight\r\ndesperately so, and forty-eight slightly.\r\n\r\nOne hundred and seventy-two known encounters,—but of course by far the\r\ngreater number remained unrecorded.\r\n\r\nThe following instances, culled from records of the eighteenth century,\r\nand all connected with Hyde Park, give some idea of the variety of\r\npleas and the personality of the combatants figuring in duels of the\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nSo many writers of renown—including Defoe, Swift, Thackeray, Martin\r\nHume, and others—have described the circumstances of the great and\r\nfatal duel between the Duke of Hamilton and Lord Mohun, which was\r\nfought early in the eighteenth century in Hyde Park, that we need\r\nmerely allude to it.\r\n\r\nA lawsuit had been raging between these two nobles, and it is alleged\r\nthat this was used as a shield for a political scheme to get rid of the\r\nDuke of Hamilton, who had just been appointed Ambassador to the Court\r\nof Versailles, where the Old Pretender was a refugee.\r\n\r\nThe Duke most unwillingly took Mohun’s challenge, as he was well known\r\nto be a man of bad character; but the second, Macartney, arranged a\r\nmeeting. Seconds as well as the principals fought at that period, and\r\nMacartney having wounded Colonel Hamilton, the Duke’s second, disarmed.\r\nThe struggle between the Duke and Mohun, however, was prolonged,\r\nalthough both were wounded in several places. At last the Duke ran\r\nMohun through the body, and while thus fixed the latter shortened his\r\nsword, and pierced Hamilton through the lungs. Mohun expired on the\r\nspot. The Duke was carried to the Cheesecake House, but died on the\r\nway. Macartney fled, and Colonel Hamilton accused him of having stabbed\r\nthe Duke when he was trying to raise him. The trial came off the next\r\nyear, and “Manslaughter” was the verdict; upon which Macartney then\r\ncharged Colonel Hamilton with perjury.\r\n\r\nThree years after the accession of George III. the noted Wilkes, who\r\nhad already been one of the principals in a duel with Lord Talbot at\r\nBagshot, was involved in another quarrel, both being on the subject\r\nof his writings in the _Northern Briton_. In this paper he had given\r\nsome character sketches which evidently alluded to Mr. Samuel Martin,\r\nM.P. for Camelford, and late Secretary to the Treasury (he figured as\r\nthe hero in Churchill’s _Duellist_). The passage which gave offence to\r\nMartin was:\r\n\r\n“The Secretary of a certain Board, and a very apt tool of a Ministerial\r\npersecution, who, with a snout worthy of a Portuguese inquisitor, is\r\nhourly looking out for carrion in office, to feed the _maw_ of the\r\ninsatiable vulture, _imo, etiam in senatum venit, notat et designat\r\nunumquemque nostrum_,[5] he marks us, and all our innocent families,\r\nfor beggary and ruin. Neither the tenderness of age nor the sacredness\r\nof sex is spared by the cruel Scot.”\r\n\r\nMartin denounced Wilkes in the House of Commons in an angry oration,\r\nwhich was as insulting as he could make it.\r\n\r\nWilkes retorted by a violent letter, saying he had written every word\r\nof the articles, to which Martin wrote an indignant reply, concluding\r\nhis communication with the following words:\r\n\r\n  “I desire that you may meet me in Hyde Park immediately, with a brace\r\n  of pistols each, to determine our difference. I shall go to the Ring\r\n  in Hyde Park, with my pistols so concealed that nobody may see them;\r\n  and I will wait in expectation of you for one hour. As I shall call\r\n  in my way at your house, to deliver this letter, I propose to go from\r\n  thence directly to the Ring in Hyde Park; from whence we may proceed,\r\n  if it be necessary, to any more private place. And I mention that I\r\n  shall wait an hour in order to give you the full time to meet me. I\r\n  am, Sir, etc.,\r\n\r\n  “SAMUEL MARTIN.”\r\n\r\nArrived at Hyde Park, they were obliged to dally a while, in order to\r\nget rid of people who were loitering there. Martin missed Wilkes in his\r\nfirst shot, and Wilkes’s pistol only flashed. They thereupon proceeded\r\nto take their second pistols. Wilkes missed, but was shot in the\r\nstomach by Martin’s ball. Martin, seeing him fall, rushed to help his\r\nantagonist, but Wilkes, congratulating him on being a man of honour,\r\ninsisted on his going off at once, in order that nobody should know who\r\nhad wrought the deed, for he had lost much blood, and thought himself\r\ndying. Wilkes was carried home in a chair, and two doctors attending\r\nhim extracted the ball, but he still feared that his life was ebbing,\r\nand therefore sent the letter of challenge that he had received from\r\nMartin back to the writer, so that in case of his death there would be\r\nno trace left of the slayer.\r\n\r\nWilkes wrote to the House of Commons explaining his state of health,\r\nand a month after the duel, Parliament made an order that in addition\r\nto his own physicians two others should attend him; but these Wilkes\r\nrefused to see.\r\n\r\nMartin fled to Paris, where Wilkes shortly afterwards followed, and\r\nthey met on good terms, although, when it became publicly known that\r\nMartin had been his antagonist and had so nearly brought his life to a\r\nclose, public opinion was much aroused against him.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to this political row, attention is attracted to another\r\n_affaire d’honneur_ that was decided in Kensington Gravel Pits. Its\r\nvery domesticity leads one to digress a little. Hot-blooded, impetuous,\r\nlovable romance was aroused in an Irish family of renown, by the\r\nmarriage of the daughter of the house to an officer without the consent\r\nand knowledge of the family. One of her brothers sided against her,\r\nand another brother challenged him on account of his cruel behaviour\r\ntowards their sister. The fight was eager and real, and a dangerous\r\nwound was given, but history does not relate whether it was family\r\npride or chivalric defence of the sister that received the blow.\r\n\r\nToo often the absurd and ridiculous was the culmination of an\r\nexhibition of boastfulness and bombast in these encounters. For\r\ninstance, the courage of the lady in the Garrick duel rendered the\r\npositions of the men somewhat comical. It will be remembered that\r\nGeorge Garrick was the brother of the famous actor, David Garrick.\r\nHe had for some time been talked of as being very attentive to Mrs.\r\nBaddeley, the wife of a mummer at Drury Lane. Baddeley’s jealousy was\r\nfanned by an intriguing Jewish friend, who made much trouble between\r\nthe three, and Baddeley demanded satisfaction in Hyde Park. Garrick put\r\nup his pistol and fired into the air, and Baddeley—whose arm is said to\r\nhave shaken like an aspen leaf—fired, but did no damage.\r\n\r\nAt this point of the proceedings a hackney coach drove towards them\r\nat a furious pace, and on its arrival at the scene of conflict Mrs.\r\nBaddeley rushed out, throwing herself between the combatants, shrieking:\r\n\r\n“Spare him!—Spare him!”\r\n\r\nSo ended a truly dramatic scene worthy of the stage itself.\r\n\r\nIndeed, in this matter-of-fact twentieth century it seems childish, if\r\nnot idiotic, to fight over an affront, the truth of which the opponents\r\nhad never taken the trouble to ascertain. Yet, in 1773, Mr. Whateley,\r\nbrother of the previous Secretary of the Treasury, and Mr. John Temple,\r\nLieut.-Governor of New Hampshire, fought in Hyde Park, the former\r\nbeing badly wounded. They had quarrelled over the publication of some\r\nconfidential State papers, and after they had fought and bled for their\r\nopinions, Benjamin Franklin wrote to say that neither of them could\r\npossibly have known anything about the letters in question.\r\n\r\nImagine such a state of affairs in present-day politics and diplomacy,\r\nwhen Mr. Speaker’s “Withdraw” commands sufficient satisfaction to the\r\nfeelings of injured politicians, and quells any hot-blooded exhibition\r\nof un-English spirit in the House.\r\n\r\nThe army was ever to the fore in the fray. As with many others of these\r\nbitter feuds, the case given below ended in firing into the air, and\r\nexaggerated compliments, which again gave a touch of absurdity to the\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\nOn 22nd March 1780, the Earl of Shelburne (the first Marquis of\r\nLansdowne), with Lord Frederick Cavendish as his second, and Colonel\r\nFullarton, Member for Plympton, whose second was Lord Balcarras, fought\r\nat 5.30 one morning in Hyde Park. Lord Shelburne had said that Colonel\r\nFullarton and his regiment “were as ready to act against the liberties\r\nof England as against her enemies.” The officer repudiated the charge\r\nin the House of Commons, and the duel was the outcome. Lord Shelburne\r\nand Colonel Fullarton walked across the Park together, while Lord\r\nBalcarras and Lord Frederick Cavendish made the necessary arrangements,\r\nand decided that the weapons should be pistols. The combatants were\r\nplaced twelve paces apart, and the most formal etiquette was observed.\r\nLord Shelburne’s pistols had been already loaded, but finding that\r\nFullarton and Lord Balcarras had come prepared to load on the spot, the\r\nEarl and Lord Frederick Cavendish wished to draw the charges. This,\r\nhowever, their opponents would not allow, and Lord Balcarras loaded\r\nhis principal’s weapons.\r\n\r\nColonel Fullarton, who was thus avenging the insult placed upon him by\r\nLord Shelburne, asked his antagonist to fire, but the Earl declined.\r\nThe seconds gave the word for the officer to fire, which he did, but\r\nwith no result. Lord Shelburne then took aim but missed. The second\r\npistol, however, took effect, and the soldier wounded his antagonist in\r\nthe right groin. There was the usual rush towards the fallen man. Lord\r\nFrederick Cavendish put out his hand to take Lord Shelburne’s pistol\r\nfrom him, but he would not give it up, exclaiming that he had not fired\r\nyet. Colonel Fullarton had run forward with the others to help his foe,\r\nbut on hearing this he again took up his position. The Earl, perceiving\r\nwhat he had done, remarked:\r\n\r\n“Sure, sir, you do not think I would fire my pistol at you.” And\r\nthereupon he let it off in the air.\r\n\r\nThe seconds proceeded to inquire into the feelings of their principals,\r\nand if they thought satisfaction had been given.\r\n\r\n“Although I am wounded,” said the Earl, “I am able to go on if you feel\r\nany resentment.”\r\n\r\n“I hope I am incapable of harbouring such a sentiment,” returned the\r\nsoldier. “As your Lordship is wounded, and has fired into the air, it\r\nis impossible for me to go on.”\r\n\r\nAnd so the little group dispersed, the seconds having declared that\r\n“the parties had ended the affair by behaving as men of the strictest\r\nhonour.”\r\n\r\nCould anything be nearer mummery and fiasco than this? Approaching the\r\nspot outwardly on friendly terms, while inwardly chafing and showering\r\nmaledictions each on his opponent—a shot into space. And then—\r\n\r\nSmiles, bows, compliments, and an end to the life and death question of\r\na few minutes before.\r\n\r\nThe Church and the Law were not less addicted to this swaggering or\r\nappearance on the duelling grounds of Hyde Park, for that same year a\r\nduel was fought between the Rev. Mr. Bates and a Mr. R——, a student of\r\nthe law. Both of these men were on the staff of _The Morning Post_. The\r\nfirst fire fell to the lot of the clergyman, who wounded Mr. R—— in the\r\nfleshy part of his arm. He was not incapacitated, however, for he was\r\nable to return the fire, but missed, whereupon the seconds declared the\r\nmatter settled.\r\n\r\nTwo years later, Mr. Dulany, a gentleman who owned a great deal of\r\nproperty in Maryland, and who lived in Park Street, Grosvenor Square,\r\nquarrelled with the Rev. —— Allen, who was also engaged on _The Morning\r\nPost_. In the issue of that paper on 29th June 1779 an article had\r\nappeared, headed “Characters of Principal Men in Rebellion.” Allen\r\nhad owned the authorship of this, in a letter written to Dulany in\r\ninsulting and threatening terms. Dulany sent a verbal message in reply;\r\nother communications followed, and the men who carried them—Morris for\r\nAllen, and Delancey for Dulany—came forward as their seconds.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Camp Kitchen in Hyde Park.      _From an Old Print._]\r\n\r\nOn the evening of 26th June, Dulany and Delancey were to be seen\r\nwalking across the Park from Grosvenor Square about half-past nine.\r\nThere at an appointed place they met Allen and Morris. Pistols were\r\nfired at eight yards distance. Dulany fell, dangerously wounded. He\r\ndied at his house in Park Street six days after. Allen and Morris\r\nwere advertised for, with a reward of ten guineas to the finder. They\r\nsurrendered, and were tried for “Wilful Murder.” But finally Allen\r\nwas fined one shilling, and sentenced to six months imprisonment, and\r\nMorris was acquitted.\r\n\r\nIt would be rather amusing if newspaper quarrels were settled to-day\r\nin this fashion, and whole battalions of writers were seen wending\r\ntheir way in the early hours of the morning to Hyde Park, to enjoy the\r\npleasures of dramatic encounters which seldom had a serious ending.\r\n\r\nBut there were occasions when the Park was the scene of bloody\r\nconflict. Fierce fighting raged there, ghastly sights rivalling Tyburn\r\nwere enacted under those old trees, which, could they but record\r\ntheir experiences, would hand to the world an unequalled series of\r\n“Reminiscences.”\r\n\r\nFor some unknown cause, on a September morning in the waning eighteenth\r\ncentury, such a conflict disturbed the fresh quietude of the glade.\r\nColonel the Hon. Cosmo Gordon and Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas met at\r\nthe Ring to fight a duel. It was agreed by their seconds that, after\r\nreceiving their pistols, they should advance and fire when they\r\npleased. When about eight yards from each other the triggers fell\r\nalmost simultaneously, but only Colonel Cosmo Gordon’s weapon went\r\noff. His adversary then fired, and Colonel Cosmo Gordon was seriously\r\nwounded in the thigh.\r\n\r\nThe second pistols had no result, but after they were reloaded, the\r\nduellists again advanced and fired at about the same distance as\r\nbefore, when Colonel Thomas was badly wounded in the body. He fell,\r\nand though the ball was immediately removed by the surgeon whom he had\r\nbrought with him, death followed.\r\n\r\nAn action like this was no little Society function of the day, no mere\r\nworking up to the rôle for the sake of appearances. It meant real\r\nfeeling on the part of the actors, and the cause was deep-seated.\r\n\r\nSome pages back, mention was made that youths fought in sheer imitation\r\nof their elders and superiors in rank and position. A record survives\r\nas a ghastly illustration of the habit. One Thursday night four law\r\nstudents were spending the evening together at the Cecil Coffee House,\r\nwhere one of them, an Irishman named Frizell, lodged. They caroused\r\ntill one o’clock in the morning, when Frizell declared he could drink\r\nno more. This annoyed another Irishman among the little party, whose\r\nname was Clark. He taunted Frizell with inhospitality. Frizell replied\r\nthat he had meant nothing, but that if he had given offence he was also\r\nready to give satisfaction. He then went off to bed.\r\n\r\nClark declared to the other two companions that Frizell had challenged\r\nhim, and though they repeatedly assured him there was no challenge in\r\nthe words addressed to him he still remained unappeased, mounted to his\r\nfriend’s bedroom, and would hear of no arrangement but that they should\r\nhave a duel in five minutes.\r\n\r\nFrizell immediately put on his clothes and joined the others, saying\r\nthat if his friends (Evans and Montgomery) considered that he had given\r\noffence he was perfectly willing to apologise. Clark, however, would\r\ntake no apology, and insisted that they should fight it out in an\r\nhour’s time, at three o’clock in the morning, in Hyde Park.\r\n\r\nThere the party of four proceeded, after their seconds had managed to\r\nsecure a brace of pistols between them. They stood at ten yards; Clark,\r\nstill throbbing with the emotion of imagined wrong, won first fire, and\r\nwounded Frizell, whose pistol went off as he fell. Montgomery ran for\r\na coach to take him to a surgeon’s, but on his return found the young\r\nman dead. The two others were standing by the corpse, surrounded by\r\nsoldiers from Knightsbridge. They were detained some minutes, when the\r\nSergeant said they might go. They climbed into the coach into which\r\nFrizell’s corpse had been lifted, but when they reached Piccadilly,\r\nClark and his second alighted, and were never heard of again.\r\n\r\nA sad ending, indeed, to a little debauch in a tavern that began\r\nmirthfully enough, but one only too frequent a hundred years ago.\r\n\r\nRomance also figured as the cause of many a duel. About this time a\r\ncelebrated contest was fought in Hyde Park, ending there tamely enough\r\nindeed, though it culminated in tragedy elsewhere.\r\n\r\nMiss King, the sixteen-year-old daughter of Lord Kingsborough, eloped\r\nfrom Windsor with her second cousin, Colonel Fitzgerald, who was\r\nalready married to a very beautiful lady. Her mother advertised,\r\noffering one hundred pounds reward for her recovery. Lord Kingsborough\r\nwas in Ireland, but as soon as he heard of the affair he and his son,\r\nColonel King, came to England, and with some difficulty found Colonel\r\nFitzgerald and challenged him. So great was Fitzgerald’s disrepute that\r\nhe could find no one willing to be his second; but Major Wood, who was\r\nKing’s second, insisted on his asking his surgeon to fill the office\r\nfor him. The doctor refused, but promised that he would keep in sight,\r\nand a fellow-surgeon having been secured, Major Wood prevailed upon\r\nhim to be a witness that all was fair. Six shots were fired without\r\neffect. A parley then took place, but the duel was continued till\r\nColonel Fitzgerald’s bullets were expended, and the combatants arranged\r\na further meeting the next day. This, however, never came off, as both\r\nofficers were arrested.\r\n\r\nThe lady in question had been taken to Ireland, and was living at the\r\nhouse of her father (then the Earl of Kingstown). On his release,\r\nColonel Fitzgerald, with whom Miss King, through the intermediacy of\r\na servant, had been carrying on communication, followed her. News of\r\nhis presence reached Colonel King, who had succeeded his father in the\r\ncourtesy title of Lord Kingsborough. He went to a lodging occupied\r\nby Fitzgerald, and was refused admittance, whereupon he burst the\r\ndoor open and entered the room, carrying with him a brace of pistols.\r\nHe told Fitzgerald to take one of these, and at that moment the men\r\ngrappled and a struggle ensued. The Earl of Kingstown meantime had been\r\ninformed where his son had gone, and, having followed him, arrived in\r\nthe midst of the fray. Thinking Lord Kingsborough was in danger of his\r\nlife, he fired, and his son’s adversary fell dead on the spot.\r\n\r\nThis chapter, though dealing but in cursory fashion with the subject,\r\nmust not be closed without reference to two strange incidents which\r\nended in duels. In the first the encounter itself was fought in Hyde\r\nPark; in the second the circumstance which led to the duel was enacted\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nOn 9th June, 1792, the Earl of Lonsdale and Captain Cuthbert, of\r\nthe Guards, found cause of quarrel. The latter was on duty in the\r\nneighbourhood, when confusion in the traffic occurred in Mount Street;\r\nhe therefore forbade any carriages to come there. Lord Lonsdale,\r\ndriving by in his equipage, was almost the first to be stopped, at\r\nwhich his Lordship was much incensed.\r\n\r\n“You rascal, do you know I am a peer of the realm?” he cried.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know that you are a peer,” was the officer’s quick retort,\r\n“but I know you are a scoundrel for applying such a term to an officer\r\non duty, and I will make you answer for it.”\r\n\r\nA meeting was, of necessity, the consequence, but a pair of pistols on\r\neach side wrought no injury to either party. Captain Cuthbert, however,\r\nhad a narrow escape, for the ball from Lord Lonsdale’s second pistol\r\nstruck the button of his coat, which prevented it from entering his\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nThe second incident occurred in Hyde Park in 1803. Lieut.-Colonel\r\nMontgomery and Captain Macnamara were riding there, each followed by a\r\nNewfoundland. The dogs fought. Colonel Montgomery, who did not see that\r\nhis fellow-officer was near, separated the animals, and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“Whose dog is that?—I will knock him down.”\r\n\r\nTo which Macnamara replied:\r\n\r\n“Have you the impudence to say that you will knock my dog down? You\r\nmust first knock me down.”\r\n\r\nA dispute followed, and cards were exchanged. A meeting was arranged at\r\nPrimrose Hill, in which Colonel Montgomery was mortally wounded, and\r\ndied almost immediately.\r\n\r\nAll this seems very trifling to modern ideas, and the grave\r\nconsequences out of all proportion to the insult offered, yet it\r\nrepresents the spirit of the age.\r\n\r\nMany well-known persons, besides those mentioned, figured as duellists\r\nin that time—Talbot, Townshend, Byron, Pitt, Fox, Canning, Sir Robert\r\nPeel, Lord Castlereagh, the Duke of York (1789), all had their “affairs\r\nof honour,” which were settled in the customary way. Nor must the Duke\r\nof Wellington be omitted. It was far into the nineteenth century before\r\nduelling ceased to be the fashion, and it is interesting to notice that\r\nas Hyde Park fell more and more into the hand of gardeners, and—with\r\nTyburn removed—assumed a more respectable and safe reputation, so the\r\nduels fought became fewer.\r\n\r\nWimbledon Common was a popular spot for the purpose in the early\r\nnineteenth century. The last known duel fought between Englishmen in\r\nthis country apparently took place in 1845, at Gosport, between Lieut.\r\nHawkey, of the Royal Marines, and Mr. Seton, of the 11th Hussars, the\r\nlatter being killed.\r\n\r\nDuelling in Hyde Park is no more, and suicide of rare occurence,\r\nalthough there are often riding accidents to-day.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[5] “Yes, he even comes into the Senate, observes and singles out each\r\nof us.” Words of Cicero applied to Catiline.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE PEOPLE’S PARK\r\n\r\n\r\nThe London Parks strike different people in different ways, and\r\ncertainly a bailiff of the late well-known Yorkshire squire, Sir Tatton\r\nSykes, looked upon them with different eyes from the ordinary mortal.\r\n\r\nSir Tatton sent him to London to see the sights, and on his return\r\nasked him what he thought of London.\r\n\r\n“Lots o’ houses,” he said, “and I found some pretty good pasture, only\r\nit was a bit scattered.”\r\n\r\nThis was the way he summed up the beautiful squares and parks of London.\r\n\r\nIt is extraordinary how this class of people look upon things\r\ngenerally. I well remember an old gardener of my grandfather’s who,\r\nafter fifty years’ service in the family, was given a treat to London.\r\nWhen he got back to Lancashire he also was asked what he thought of\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\n“I was just in a haze,” he said, “and they took me to bed in a\r\nhoist,”—this being his description of going up to bed in a lift at the\r\nLondon hotel.\r\n\r\nLike every other big town, London has its areas strictly mapped out,\r\nonly in this great community the lines of cleavage are more marked than\r\nin others. Live but a few streets too far citywards, and you lose the\r\nprivilege of belonging to the West End, and are merged in the great\r\nmiddle class.\r\n\r\nThe middle class, too, has its line of divergence, to travel beyond\r\nwhich is to lose middle-class status, and sink into the maelstrom of\r\nthe East End. All this, no doubt, is snobbish; but then every class has\r\nits snobs just as it has its bores, no matter into which particular\r\nclass one may be born, or risen, or descended.\r\n\r\nHyde Park, however, is the common heritage of all, the meeting-ground\r\nof King and coster. It is the most truly democratic spot in all London.\r\nIt is surprising what tolerance there is, what good feeling pervades\r\nthe throng made up of such extraordinary mixtures and contradictions.\r\n\r\nA well-dressed woman, who goes into a mean street of slum-land, is\r\nmade the subject of audible remarks, mostly ribald, too often coarse.\r\nHer fashionable costume seems to excite hatred. The would-be finery\r\nof the Park no doubt envies the real finery. The workman in his heart\r\nis contemptuous of the frock-coated “swell,” but they meet there on a\r\nquiet and friendly footing. Passions of class distinction are subdued\r\nwithin the fairy ring of Hyde Park. A lady walking or driving in its\r\nprecincts need never fear being assailed by anything likely to offend\r\nher ear.\r\n\r\nManners, too, have changed. My father would have thought it an awful\r\nthing to have smoked in the Row. Nobody would have dreamt of doing\r\nsuch a thing in the sixties or seventies, or even eighties. Nowadays\r\ncigars and cigarettes are quite common, while a pipe is sometimes to be\r\nseen in the morning or evening, between the lips of some business or\r\nprofessional man going or coming from his office or chambers.\r\n\r\nOf the Park habitués, Royalty must necessarily come first. Between nine\r\nand ten o’clock almost any morning of the week, when he is in town, the\r\nPrince of Wales, faultlessly mounted, and generally attended by Sir\r\nArthur Bigge, may be seen entering the Park at Hyde Park Corner. To the\r\nmost of the world he goes unnoticed. He rides as quietly as any other\r\ngentleman in the Row, and so as not to disturb his pleasure no one bows\r\nunless personally acquainted with his Royal Highness. Like his father,\r\nhe has a happy knack of seeing people and beckoning to them, or, if\r\nnecessary, sending Sir Arthur Bigge, or the groom who follows, to say\r\nhe wishes to speak to them. The Prince is noted for his chaffing, merry\r\nway.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Connaught, not even attended by a gentleman-in-waiting, the\r\nDuke of Fife, the Duke of Teck, and Prince Francis of Teck, and a host\r\nof others, ride at the same hour, and often join forces with the future\r\nKing of England.\r\n\r\nOne of the best-known figures in the Row, and yet at the same time not\r\na rider, is Lord Alverstone, the Lord Chief Justice, who walks through\r\nthe Park on his way to the Law Courts. It is quite extraordinary\r\nthe number of well-known people who may be seen riding every day.\r\nOne may frequently espy the clear-cut face of Mr. Justice Grantham,\r\nsometimes chatting with his fellow-judge, Sir Charles Darling, who\r\nseems to have found the secret of perpetual youth; and also Mr. Justice\r\nLawrence. In his time the late Lord Brampton, whose title of nobility\r\ncan never obscure the sarcasm of Mr. Justice Hawkins, took his daily\r\nconstitutional under the trees.\r\n\r\nAmong Members of both Houses of Parliament, riding or walking, are\r\nthe Marquis of Lansdowne, beautifully mounted, Mr. Winston Churchill\r\ntalking to himself, and Sir John Dickson-Poynder.\r\n\r\nDr. Fridtjof Nansen, the Arctic explorer, and till lately Norwegian\r\nMinister in London, often rode in the Park; and also Count Paul\r\nWolff-Metternich. Count Albert Mensdorf, Herr Pouilly-Dietrichstein,\r\nthe Austro-Hungarian Ambassador, walk, and so do the Earl of Rosebery\r\nand Mr. Leopold de Rothschild. The Duke and Duchess of Somerset, the\r\nDuchess of Sutherland, the Countess of Warwick, Muriel Viscountess\r\nHelmsley, Mary Lady Inverclyde, Sir Alfred Turner, and hosts of others\r\nfamiliar in London society, ride among the throng, in which are\r\nfrequently to be seen West End doctors—Sir Felix Semon, Mr. Butlin, Mr.\r\nClinton Dent, Dr. Dakin, Dr. Cautly, Mr. Arbuthnot Lane, Dr. Kingston\r\nFowler, Mr. Collins; and artists—Mr. Solomon J. Solomon, R.A., Mr.\r\nShannon, A.R.A., and Mr. Linley Sambourne of _Punch_.\r\n\r\nActors are there too. Mr. Cyril Maud, Mr. George Alexander, Mr. Allan\r\nAinsworth, Mr. Beerbohm Tree, Mr. Boucicault; to say nothing of Gibson\r\ngirls, those mysterious folk who only earn a pound a week, and yet ride\r\nthoroughbreds and drive motor cars.\r\n\r\nThe only people who have the right to drive in a carriage down Rotten\r\nRow are His Majesty King Edward, who, unlike his mother, has never\r\nexercised that privilege, and the Duke of St. Albans, as Hereditary\r\nGrand Falconer.\r\n\r\nAn enormously wealthy and well-known financier used to ride every day\r\nin Hyde Park. He was never much of a horseman, and as he grew older\r\nthe little nerve he had possessed gradually went. Nevertheless, he\r\nwas determined not to give up the habit of years, and if, after all,\r\nhis ride did not give him much pleasure, it employed a vast number of\r\npeople, and so lessened the ranks of the unemployed. First of all, a\r\ngroom had to exercise his horse for a couple of hours, that is to say,\r\ntake all the pluck out of it, so that a handsome but jaded steed was\r\nleft for a little gentle exercise.\r\n\r\nBefore, and beside him, two other grooms were in attendance, the idea\r\nbeing that while one was at his service, the other had a second horse\r\nin case he required it. More than that, an empty carriage, with a pair\r\nof horses and a couple of men-servants, wandered round the Park as long\r\nas he was riding, and as close within earshot as possible. They were\r\nto take the good gentleman home if he was tired. One would imagine\r\nthat this was sufficient for one solitary man’s ride for an hour, but\r\nnot at all. Two or three men in plain clothes, really grooms from this\r\ngentleman’s stables, were stationed at intervals down the Row, so that\r\nif anything went wrong they might rush to his service at once. I have\r\noften wondered if that good man’s morning ride did not cost him more\r\npain than pleasure.\r\n\r\nBeside the riders who are there for amusement, mounted police are\r\nthe only people who gallop up and down Rotten Row, but there was an\r\nexception to this rule a few years back.\r\n\r\nIn 1890, a year memorable for the number of processions to the Park,\r\nand demonstrations held therein, discontent was aroused in the minds of\r\nsome of the younger policemen at the extra work entailed. These Sunday\r\nprocessions became a weekly occurrence, and of course extra police were\r\nrequired to look after them. Naturally, when this went on for some time\r\nthe men in blue felt aggrieved. They wanted their Sundays like everyone\r\nelse. The “agitators,” not being particularly anxious to have their\r\nservices, at once suggested that they should go out on strike.\r\n\r\nOne hot July day these members of the force struck or committed some\r\nsuch acts of insubordination, and confusion reigned at Bow Street.\r\nThe unswerving loyalty of the main body of the Metropolitan Police,\r\nhowever, saved the situation, but for a couple of days troopers from\r\nKnightsbridge barracks were to be seen patrolling Rotten Row, in place\r\nof our usual dignified guardians of the peace.\r\n\r\nOne of the uses of the Park—too often a misuse—is that of a meeting\r\nground for all kinds of demonstrations. When any body of people—men or\r\nwomen—wish to attract, they call out the crowd to “demonstrate,” and\r\nmarch to Hyde Park. The place is big enough to contain them without\r\nmuch disturbance to the other habitués, and as a “safety valve” it is\r\nsafer than Trafalgar Square, with so many shop-windows within reach.\r\n\r\nNothing about these demonstrations is more wonderful than the way they\r\nare handled by the police. As soon as one is planned, information has\r\nto be forwarded to Scotland Yard by the promoters, and arrangements\r\nare immediately made. The processions often start from many different\r\nquarters, but wherever they come, or wherever they go, they are\r\nshepherded the whole time by the “bobbies” in blue, or in mufti.\r\n\r\nIn 1886 a detachment of one of these demonstrations got out of hand\r\nand struck terror to the West End, where they wrecked a number of\r\nshops in Piccadilly and Audley Street,—named by some wit “Disorderly\r\nStreet,”—and Oxford Street. This caused a scare, and as broken windows\r\nand broken heads are not things to be encouraged, preparations have\r\nbeen more carefully made ever since, though most wisely concealed.\r\n\r\nRumour has it that, by telephone with Scotland Yard, a thousand extra\r\nmen can be brought into Hyde Park at a few moments’ notice, and that a\r\nnumber are kept very much nearer the scene of action during the whole\r\ntime of a demonstration in case of need. There are police barracks near\r\nthe Royal Humane Society’s station, where a large force could be kept\r\nready. Nowhere in the world is such a well-organised and well-worked\r\nsystem to be found. London is the model on which all the police\r\nregulations of other capitals are formed.\r\n\r\nThe Metropolitan Police have seven hundred square miles under their\r\njurisdiction. They are some twenty thousand strong, and whether we\r\nsee a single mounted policeman clearing the way for the Queen to pass\r\nup the Lady’s Mile in Hyde Park, or hundreds of them manipulating a\r\ndemonstration of fifty thousand people in Hyde Park, we look on and\r\nmarvel.\r\n\r\nAbout £8000 a year is spent on police work for this park alone. It\r\nseems a large sum, but is nothing compared with the amount of useful\r\nwork they do. Only a century or so back the park was not safe at night;\r\nbut now, although still badly lighted, thanks to the police force, any\r\none who passes through may feel secure.\r\n\r\nOf the many demonstrations that have taken place of recent years, the\r\nmost epoch-making was probably the march of the suffragettes in 1907.\r\n\r\nWhile ladies had actually been elected, and seven of them were calmly\r\ntaking their seats in the Parliament of Finland—the most advanced\r\ncorner of the world as regards women’s rights—our English sisters were\r\nmarching to Hyde Park. They had tried quiet means and loud; addressed\r\nmeetings, waved flags, and shouted from behind the grill in the House\r\nof Commons, had fought policemen in open combat in the streets; and\r\nthen they bethought themselves of a gigantic open-air muster.\r\n\r\nSmart ladies in thousand-guinea motors, costers who were forced to\r\nleave their carts outside, factory women with babies in their arms,\r\ntitled dames and girls from the slums, all marched or rode or drove\r\nin that great procession. The suffragettes behaved most moderately in\r\nHyde Park. The noisy scenes were all reserved for Westminster, where a\r\nMember of Parliament laughingly remarked to me:\r\n\r\n“I love women, but I don’t like them when they are carried away by\r\ntheir feelings, and then by the policeman.”\r\n\r\nAfter a suffragist riot outside the House of Commons, a constable was\r\nasked by a Member if they had had many people in the row.\r\n\r\n“Never saw such a sight here in my life, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Really?—Were they very unruly?”\r\n\r\n“Awful, just kicking and scratching, and going on anyhow.”\r\n\r\n“And you didn’t get hurt?”\r\n\r\n“No, thank you, sir. You see, I am a married man, so I know how to\r\nhandle women.”\r\n\r\nFor forty years women worked quietly for their rights and got nothing,\r\nand so they are determined to proclaim their wrongs from the housetops\r\nuntil they are heard.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the Park, one Sunday on the grass, stood a red\r\nflag on a waggonette, from which the horse has been unhitched. In\r\nthe vehicle sat four women; a large crowd surrounded them. It was a\r\nsuffragette meeting. An elderly woman was speaking, her audience was\r\nmainly composed of men of every class and grade,—from the Society\r\nman in immaculate silk hat and frock-coat to the tramp with his\r\ngrubby bundle under his arm. Here and there a woman’s dress relieved\r\nthe sombre-looking crowd with a bit of colour, and nurses wheeling\r\nperambulators, occupied by aristocratic babies, formed a fringed border\r\nto the gathering. Shouts of laughter rose every few seconds; even the\r\nburly policemen, scattered here and there through the crowd, joined in\r\nthe merriment with more than a good-humoured chuckle. The old lady was\r\nbringing her speech to a close.\r\n\r\n“And what have you men done with the world, the lot of ye?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“And what are ye afraid we women shall do with the world when we’ve our\r\nvote?\r\n\r\n“Afraid! that’s what ye are!”\r\n\r\nEach remark produced a roar of laughter, which rose higher and higher\r\neach time.\r\n\r\n“You don’t want churches,” she continued. “Ruskin said you don’t want\r\nchurches——”\r\n\r\n“Who did?” asked one of the crowd.\r\n\r\n“Why, Ruskin,” she replied. “I read it not long ago.... We don’t want\r\nchurches either.”\r\n\r\n“What _do you_ want, then,—public-houses?” asked a facetious\r\ninterrupter.\r\n\r\n“No,” was the quick reply; “we are going to put down public-houses and\r\nbuild nice _homes_.”\r\n\r\nAfter some more remarks of a like kind the old lady sat down, and one\r\nof the suffragettes, who had lately taken a change and rest at the\r\nexpense of the Government, rose and edified the company by a series\r\nof remarks, which she apparently thought smart and clever, but which\r\nwere only calculated to do harm to her cause. Promiscuous men and women\r\nspeakers in the Park are generally cranks, who do no good to the cause\r\nthey advocate. The women, however, who organised that gigantic meeting\r\nin 1907 marked an epoch not only in the position of the women of Great\r\nBritain, but of the whole world.\r\n\r\nA great demonstration, with its twenty or fifty thousand people,\r\nis an occasional event. When agitators are busy there may be two or\r\nthree such in a year. But never a week passes without the free air of\r\nHyde Park being disturbed by the strident cries of somebody or other,\r\nairing the grievances of himself or his class, while there is a set of\r\npublicists—well-known figures—to whom the opportunities to hear their\r\nown voices, afforded by the Park, seem to be their meat and drink and\r\nvegetables. Assuredly they would die in oblivion were the gates closed\r\nagainst them.\r\n\r\nYou will find them at the same spots year in year out, proclaiming\r\ntheology or agnosticism, socialism, and a dozen other “isms,” beating\r\nthe air with their fists, exhausting their physical powers by\r\ngesticulating, and not infrequently shouting repartees at one another.\r\nThey are loud but unobtrusive, and in these broad acres really disturb\r\nnobody.\r\n\r\nI recall a recent Sunday, just an ordinary day, no special gatherings\r\nof any kind, and a chill, grey afternoon towards the end of September,\r\nthe leaves fluttering down from the trees, and the few people who had\r\ndonned summer garments looking cold and blue, while occasionally a\r\ndrizzling rain fell. At the Marble Arch end of Hyde Park groups of\r\npeople had gathered at the railings of the semicircular gravel sweep.\r\n\r\nThe first group encircled a short, stout old man, who was holding\r\nforth, Bible in hand. One of his hearers interrupted, and interrupted\r\nagain. I could hear neither preacher nor questioner, but as I\r\napproached, the old man broke off his discourse:\r\n\r\n“Shut up! I say, shut up!” he shouted in a tone of command.\r\n\r\nThe disturbing one in the audience persisted.\r\n\r\n“Shut up! again I say shut up! or I’ll silence you, as I did those men\r\non the other side just now.”\r\n\r\nThen he continued his address in a wailing tone, while his troublesome\r\nlistener still had his say.\r\n\r\nThe next group were clustered round a little man in a somewhat clerical\r\ndress, holding up a written paper, perhaps eight inches square, with\r\nthe word “£2000” in large figures at the top, and smaller writing\r\nunderneath; but he was quite inaudible.\r\n\r\nThen came a typical specimen of the tub-thumper, hat on head. Had he\r\nbeen having a course of Sandow, I wondered, so fast did he move his\r\narms and hands. In the space of a few minutes the groups had swelled so\r\nmuch that the outer circle of one touched that of the next. Unitarians,\r\nCatholic Defence League, Christian Evidence Society, an Evangelist,\r\nWesleyans (who had erected a kind of pulpit, with harvest decorations),\r\nand Mr. Carlile’s much respected and ever-practical Church Army, all\r\nfound room and listeners in that corner of the Park. Besides these\r\nthere were two or three other speakers who were holding forth, and who\r\nhad no banners, but from a word or two that reached me I gathered that\r\neach was evidently representing some special sect.\r\n\r\nApart from these I saw a unique case of unrequited perseverance under\r\ndifficulties. A workman who had evidently tidied up his working clothes\r\nfor Sunday, and highly waxed his dark moustache, was standing alone,\r\nspeaking rapidly, and apparently with earnest purpose. But alas! his\r\naudience consisted of a very old woman, a toddling little boy, a baby\r\nin a perambulator, and a small girl who had to reach up to push it\r\nalong. But still he talked, looking straight in front of him, his hands\r\nat his sides; and half an hour later when I passed the spot again he\r\nwas in the same position, still talking with the same energy, still\r\nlooking straight before him, but this time there was no audience at\r\nall. I was not able to distinguish the words, and so remain ignorant of\r\nthe theme of so much eloquence.\r\n\r\nA lady sang a solo in the Wesleyan group, from a rival gathering rose\r\nthe strain of the “Old Hundredth,” and close at hand voices were raised\r\nto a third tune; but everybody seemed to like the musical combination.\r\n\r\nThere was yet another group about a hundred yards farther on. A long\r\nsort of cart, with its horse taken out, formed a platform for five men.\r\nFour sat behind the speaker, looking grave as the proverbial judge,\r\nwhile a lively promoter of the meeting hammered the atmosphere, and\r\npoured forth oratory in the following strain:\r\n\r\n“So it was done, gentlemen! there was the platform with chairs on it,\r\nand I making my way straight to it ...” (claps from the four gentlemen\r\nbehind, who looked graver still).\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen, that was the way the thing was done, that was the way\r\nthe officials treated me” (greater agitation of the atmosphere at\r\neach word). “That—was—the—way—it—was—done, at Exeter Hall, gentlemen\r\n...” (pause with reference to notes). Then a violent attack on the\r\nmanagement and speakers at a recent meeting at Exeter Hall, and on\r\nthe officials who prevented this open-air orator from reaching the\r\nplatform, which he declared was _packed_.\r\n\r\nOnly last year the Park was put to better uses. It is hardly an\r\nexaggeration to say that 80 to 90 per cent. of the congregation of\r\nan ordinary London church is composed of women. Realising that as\r\nthe people (or at least the men) did not come into the churches, the\r\nChurch must go out to the people, the Bishop of London bethought\r\nhimself to utilise Hyde Park. Thus it was that in the spring of 1907\r\nopen-air meetings were organised in Hyde Park, under the auspices of\r\nhis Evangelistical Council. These services took place on Monday nights.\r\nAbout seven o’clock the bulk of the aristocracy have left the Park and\r\nare wending their way homewards to dinner. But at that time another\r\nclass of people is free, the most of the shops are closed. Young men\r\nand young women before going home to their supper take a stroll through\r\nthe Park to enjoy the fresh air.\r\n\r\nThis is the propitious moment.\r\n\r\nThese young people have nothing to do. It does not matter to them\r\nwhether they are home an hour earlier or an hour later. All they want\r\nis a little fresh air and exercise, with a little amusement thrown in.\r\nSome stop and listen to the band, which plays every evening and is\r\nalways well attended. Others lounge about and watch the smart vehicles\r\nbearing their gaily dressed occupants homewards. Others, with no\r\nparticular object in view, stroll across the grass. Of course, a crowd\r\nalways attracts attention, and the moment it is noticed that any small\r\nthrong of people has assembled at one particular spot, others go to see\r\nand hear what it is all about.\r\n\r\nWith a devotional meeting at the Church Army Chapel in Upper Berkeley\r\nStreet, the Bishop of London’s Evangelistical Mission began its Monday\r\nevening services. Having collected a few followers, this little party\r\nmarched to Hyde Park, naturally picking up others on the way who had\r\nbeen attracted by the crowd. Arrived at Hyde Park, the clergyman\r\nconducting the meeting for the evening, proceeded to the sward near the\r\nMarble Arch, and there, within a few hundred yards of Tyburn, the very\r\nspot where Christian martyrs were hanged and sacrificed—unmolested and\r\nundisturbed and absolutely free to express whatever thought came to\r\nhim—he held forth on the subject of the Gospel.\r\n\r\nCould anything be more marvellous than the change that has come over\r\nthe spirit of the people since those terrible persecutions that took\r\nplace in the sixteenth century?\r\n\r\nUntil comparatively lately the speakers in Hyde Park were all of\r\na rough and tumble order, and so they mostly are still; but under\r\nthe leadership of the Bishop of London quite a new element has been\r\nintroduced, and excellent speakers, including not only ’Varsity men in\r\nHoly Orders, but also men following other walks in life, now hold forth\r\nin Hyde Park. To mention but a few, one finds the following well-known\r\nnames among the speakers in the summer of 1907:\r\n\r\n  The Rev. F. C. Webster, All Souls’, Langham Place.\r\n\r\n  The Rev. W. R. Mounsey, Secretary of the Bishop of London’s Council.\r\n\r\n  The Rev. Guy Rogers.\r\n\r\n  Mr. C. T. Studd, the noted cricketer, one of the famous “Cambridge\r\n  Seven” who volunteered for mission work in China.\r\n\r\n  The Rev. Russell Wakefield, St. Mary’s, Bryanston Square.\r\n\r\n  The Rev. S. A. Selwyn, Hampstead.\r\n\r\n  Colonel MᶜGregor.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Beresford Pate, the architect.\r\n\r\n  The Rev. H. S. Woolcombe, Oxford House.\r\n\r\nThe music in the Park is excellent, as may be seen by the list for\r\nSunday evenings in June 1907.\r\n\r\n                GREEN PARK.        HYDE PARK.\r\n               (6 to 8 p.m.)     (7.30 to 9.30 p.m.)\r\n  June 9th    2nd Life Guards   1st Life Guards.\r\n  June 16th   Irish Guards      Coldstream Guards.\r\n  June 23rd   Scots Guards      2nd Life Guards.\r\n  June 30th   1st Life Guards   Scots Guards.\r\n\r\nPassing reference was made to Apsley House, which faces the band-stand,\r\nin an earlier chapter. It is one of many magnificent mansions fringing\r\nthe Park, but is unique in its historic interest. I am fortunate in\r\nenjoying the friendship of an able historian of our own day, who was\r\na constant visitor at Apsley House in the days of the late Duke of\r\nWellington, and he sends me the following notes concerning the building\r\nand its associations:\r\n\r\n“The house is built partly upon a site where an apple-woman kept a\r\nstall. Her name was Allen. King George II. one day recognised her\r\nhusband as having been present at the battle of Dettingen, and granted\r\nhim the site, whereupon he built a small house. Along that side of\r\nPiccadilly there were several roadside public-houses, particularly\r\nbeyond Park Lane (Tyburn Lane), where the rough holiday makers\r\npic-nicked, especially during the celebration of May Fair at the back.\r\nAllen’s son about 1780 sold the ground where the fruit stall stood (the\r\nstall is shown in a print dated 1766) to Lord Chancellor Apsley (Lord\r\nBathurst), who had a house built by the brothers Adam for himself.\r\n\r\n“From a fund voted by Parliament for Wellington, Apsley House was\r\nbought in 1828, but it is the private property of the Duke, and is not\r\nheld as a national trust settled upon the title, as Strathfieldsaye\r\nis,—in virtue of his tenure of which, the Duke of Wellington annually\r\npresents the Sovereign with a flag on the anniversary of the battle\r\nof Waterloo. The house was re-fronted and much altered in 1828 by Sir\r\nGeoffrey Wyatville, the picture gallery on the first floor (and the\r\nrooms under) having been added for the purpose of housing the splendid\r\ncollection of heirloom pictures, captured from Joseph Bonaparte on the\r\nfield of Vittoria, and subsequently given by Ferdinand VII. to the\r\ngreat Duke.\r\n\r\n“The view of the Park and the Row from the balconies of this picture\r\ngallery is very beautiful; probably it is the best view of the Park\r\navailable at any point. The room under the gallery facing the Park at\r\nthe south-west corner is still guarded by wooden shutters, and with\r\ngood reason, for there are contained the priceless treasures given to\r\nthe great Duke by governments and Sovereigns,—presentation swords and\r\ncaskets encrusted with gems, the great silver-gilt table service given\r\nby the Portuguese nation, the famous Sèvres dinner service presented\r\nby the French, the services given by the Spanish and Prussian nations,\r\nthe Waterloo shield, the insignia in brilliants of a score of Orders,\r\nincluding the Golden Fleece, which is almost invariably returned, but\r\nin this case, as a special honour, was granted permanently. Probably\r\nno room in London except the Jewel House in the Tower contains so rare\r\na collection of priceless historic objects as this; and certainly no\r\nprivate gallery in London can boast of such a collection of historic\r\npictures as the long gallery facing the Park, and the other rooms of\r\nthe mansion.\r\n\r\n“The great Duke slept in a very small humble-looking room on the\r\nground-floor at the back, and overlooking the garden and the Park.\r\nIn the garden, which has some pretty shady trees, he used to take\r\nexercise by working a garden watering-pump in the summer; and every\r\nmorning regularly, until within a few weeks of his death, he would\r\nride out, dressed in white or buff trousers strapped under the boots,\r\na blue coat buttoned up to the chin, brass buttons and a white stock.\r\nHe always left a little before nine, followed by a groom, and rode up\r\nConstitution Hill and round to the Horse Guards.\r\n\r\n“When the mob during the Reform Bill agitation stoned the house, the\r\nwindows of the gallery on the first floor fronting the Park were\r\nbroken, and some of those facing Piccadilly. The Duke thereupon caused\r\noutside shutter blinds of steel to be fixed to the windows (similar\r\nblinds still protect the picture gallery windows, but I think these\r\nare now wood). Those in front were certainly removed by the second\r\nDuke. When the first Duke was asked to remove them he is reported to\r\nhave said: ‘No! They shall remain where they are as long as I live,\r\nas a sign of the gullibility of the mob, and the worthlessness of the\r\npopularity for which they who give it can assign no reason.’\r\n\r\n“There is a fine portrait of Napoleon as First Consul by Dabos in the\r\nsmall yellow drawing-room of Apsley House, to which rather a curious\r\nstory is attached. In May 1824 the Duke wrote an invitation to dinner\r\nto a Mr. Fleming. The messenger, by mistake, delivered it at the house\r\nof another gentleman of the same name. Finding his error, the man went\r\nagain and asked for the return of the invitation. Mr. Fleming replied\r\nthat the invitation signed by the Duke had been delivered to him, and\r\nhe meant to avail himself of it, as he should never have such an honour\r\nagain—mistake or no mistake, he should come to dinner to Apsley House.\r\nThe Duke was told, and, after inviting him, could hardly refuse him\r\nadmittance, so made the best of it, though Mr. Fleming found a very\r\nfrigid reception. The next day he sent this fine picture to His Grace\r\nby way of amends.\r\n\r\n“At the foot of the great staircase is a gigantic nude statue of\r\nNapoleon by Canova, a splendid work eleven feet high.\r\n\r\n“In the long gallery overlooking the Row and the Park, surely one\r\nof the most stately rooms in London, was held every recurring 18th\r\nof June, to the end of the great Duke’s life, the Waterloo banquet,\r\nwhere the dwindling band of companions in arms of the Chief met in the\r\nglittering panoply of the brave days gone by, to celebrate the crowning\r\nvictory that brought peace to Europe. The well-known print by Moon\r\nrepresents one of the last of these historic banquets, where, under\r\nthe splendid canvasses of Velasquez, Murillo, and Titian, the Duke of\r\nWellington is represented standing at the long, crowded dinner-table,\r\nsurrounded by his old comrades, to propose his annual toast. In the\r\nlarge yellow drawing-room the portraits of many of the old generals\r\nhang: Lord Anglesea, Picton, Hill, Somerset, Beresford, Alava, and the\r\nrest of them, their strong faces glowing still with the bright brushes\r\nof Lawrence and Pienemann, and their splendid uniforms shaming the\r\nutilitarian khaki of to-day. Some of these great old soldiers, like\r\nLord Combermere—padded and dyed phantoms they seemed, as one recollects\r\nthem—were spared to ride in the Park almost daily within the memory of\r\nthose not yet effete, but not many of them outlived their great leader.”\r\n\r\nA recent addition to the few pieces of statuary that enrich Hyde\r\nPark is Watts’ colossal “Physical Energy,” which in 1907 was placed\r\non a site in Kensington Gardens, near the Serpentine. It is the most\r\nmajestic work of its kind that the nation possesses, and even now,\r\nperhaps, we do not realise how splendid was the gift. The horse and\r\nrider are early recollections of mine. When I was a girl some time in\r\nthe eighties, I remember being taken to Melbury Road by Dr. Bond, at\r\nthat time surgeon to Westminster Hospital, and also to the Metropolitan\r\nPolice, to see the great painter, G. F. Watts. At this period I was\r\npainting a good deal myself, and exhibiting little pictures with the\r\nLady Artists, etc., and Dr. Bond, who was very fond of art and wished\r\nto encourage me to take it up seriously, suggested this expedition to\r\nWatts’ studio. I was a little alarmed as I drove up with the doctor in\r\nhis brougham, and the alarm was not decreased after walking up a flight\r\nof stairs to see a little old gentlemen in a black velvet skull cap\r\nstep forth to greet us.\r\n\r\nThis was the great Watts himself. He seemed to be very old, although he\r\ncould not have been seventy, for he did not die for about twenty years\r\nafter that, during which time he re-married.\r\n\r\nThe things that impressed me most were the age of the artist, his\r\napparent feebleness, his great geniality and charm, and, beyond all\r\nelse, the enormous statue, “Physical Energy,” on which he was at that\r\ntime at work. He touched it and fondled it, stroked it, and spoke of\r\nit with the warmest enthusiasm and love. His life’s interest seemed on\r\nthat occasion to be centred in his statue. He continued to work at it\r\nfor many years, after which it was exhibited.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most delightful modern innovation in Hyde Park, or rather\r\nKensington Gardens, is the arrangement for tea in the summer. The\r\nground is spread with little tables, sheltered beneath pretty shady\r\numbrellas, and shaded still further by the glorious elms and oaks and\r\nlimes. Here tea at a shilling a head, or at another part of the ground\r\nfor half that price, is served on warm days. It is quite a fashionable\r\nplace for little tea-parties, and bachelor-girls or old-maid men,\r\nwho live lives of solitude in “diggings” or clubs, come forth like\r\nthe butterflies and entertain their friends in this inexpensive yet\r\ncharming way, by giving a tea-fight within sight of where our good\r\nQueen Victoria was born.\r\n\r\nThis is advance at the western end of the Park, but farther east, that\r\nis to say in Piccadilly, still further advance is found. For within a\r\nstone’s throw of Hyde Park Corner, and near where the Duke of Cambridge\r\nlived so long, is a Ladies’ Club and also an Automobile Club. Ladies’\r\nClubs are not so new, although it is within the memory of many women of\r\nfifty when the first women’s club was started by an Englishwoman, Mrs.\r\nCroley, in New York. But even five years ago motors were of such recent\r\nintroduction that a club for enthusiasts would have been a meagre\r\naffair, while now it is filled to overflowing. So quickly moves the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nWhat, one wonders, will be the next innovation in or near Hyde Park?\r\n\r\nFrom the gaiety and riches of automobiles we turn to a sad and pathetic\r\nspectacle,—from youth, health, and strength we pass to decay. Such is\r\nthe panorama of life’s history.\r\n\r\nAs we saw, the first review took place in Hyde Park in the reign of\r\nQueen Elizabeth; the last thing of the kind was in December 1907, on\r\nthe occasion of the Dinner given by the _Daily Telegraph_ to the Indian\r\nMutiny veterans, when one of the most pathetic incidents of modern\r\ntimes occurred within its gates. Lord Roberts reviewed his old comrades\r\nof fifty years before, men long past their prime, old, some decrepid,\r\ndoubled with age, yet full of honour. As a result of this inspection,\r\nthe renowned Field-Marshal pleaded for the relief of the straitened\r\ncircumstances of these men, many of whom were in the workhouse; and\r\nsuch is the charity of England, that in two days—His Majesty, as is\r\nhis custom, being in the forefront in any good cause—over £5000 was\r\nsubscribed in response, quickly followed by other large sums, to create\r\na fund for the benefit of these aged soldiers.\r\n\r\nSo the scene in Hyde Park constantly changes, ever holding the mirror\r\nup to history and romance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nNATURE IN THE PARK\r\n\r\n\r\nNot long ago I came across, in the Vienna _Neue Freie Presse_, some\r\npassages in which an Austrian gentleman described the fascinations of\r\nHyde Park as it appears to a foreigner. He sees it in an aspect that\r\nis perhaps rarely revealed to ourselves, as the “most original park in\r\nEurope.”\r\n\r\n“Hyde Park,” he says, “is flat and poor—an English heath with only\r\nsomething approaching to a garden it its gates. Its charm is its\r\nvastness, its irregularity, the rest which it affords the eye with its\r\nseemingly endless stretches of turf with grazing sheep. One forgets\r\nthat one is in the heart of the capital of the world. Is it the\r\nLüneburger Heide? Is it the land of Tristan, dark Cornwall? And will\r\nnot the melancholy song of the shepherd be suddenly heard?\r\n\r\n“Hyde Park, in a way, symbolises the English character. Just as it is\r\nnot the Englishman’s way of charming at first sight, or to confide in a\r\nstranger, Hyde Park does not appeal to the foreigner when he visits it\r\nfor the first time. But as one grows to love the English after a longer\r\nacquaintance, so does one grow to love Hyde Park, so different from\r\nanything else.\r\n\r\n“It is also interesting to watch the different aspects it presents at\r\ndifferent times of the day. How fascinating, is it not, to see the\r\nstrong, youthful figures of young England plunging into the cool water,\r\nracing, boxing, and playing games, and to see the men, of the same\r\nsteel-like, well-proportioned race as the magnificent English horses\r\ngalloping up and down.\r\n\r\n“After four o’clock Hyde Park displays a spectacle of wealth, beauty,\r\nand elegance such as can only be found in cities of a very ancient\r\nculture; perhaps only in the Vienna ‘Prater’ or in the ‘Buen-Retiro’\r\nof Madrid. But while in Vienna the light ‘fiacre’ predominates, and in\r\nMadrid the heavy state-coaches drawn by majestic Andalusians, London\r\nshows every conceivable kind of vehicle, from the stately turn-out with\r\nfootmen with powdered hair to the modern electric-car.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: An Airing in Hyde Park, 1793.\r\n\r\n_From a Print in Crace Collection, British Museum._]\r\n\r\nThe keynote of this fully appreciative criticism lies in a single\r\nsentence—“so different from anything else.” Let us take credit to\r\nourselves that we have been content to let Nature work its own will\r\nto a great extent. In return Nature has given us much of her best. To\r\nthose familiar with the cultivated glories of Versailles and others\r\nof the huge continental gardens, where rows and rows of well-laid\r\nflower-beds and lawns of velvet testify to the loving care of an army\r\nof custodians, there may seem something disparaging in the comparison\r\nto “an English heath.” But what, after all, is more glorious than an\r\nEnglish heath in the first tints of autumn, what more health-giving and\r\nwelcome in the heart of London than broad acres, over which one may\r\nroam undisturbed, owing their beauty to the whole panorama of lawn and\r\ntree and shrub, rather than to the attention to smaller details which\r\ngives delight to a well-ordered garden?\r\n\r\nFor really beautiful gardening, in the true sense, one must go to the\r\nRegent’s Park, or to Ranelagh Club. Let no one suppose, however, that\r\nNature is the only gardener on the Park staff. Because the hand of man\r\nis unobtrusive, it does not follow that there is a lack of attention in\r\nassisting Nature in her beautiful work. An immense amount of planting\r\nand bedding is constantly going on, results of which are seen in the\r\nalways fresh appearance of the Park, and the glories of the flowering\r\nplants as they follow one another in season. If “landscape gardening”—a\r\nmuch-abused term—be looked for, it may be admitted there is little of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIndeed, almost the sole attempt has been the construction of the\r\nwaterfall trickling between the boulders, and the pool, covered in\r\nsummer with green growth, below the Serpentine’s steep bank. It is\r\npretty enough, and quite a paradise for the birds and rabbits, to\r\nwhom the railed-in enclosure is sacred, and yet it appears oddly out\r\nof keeping with the surroundings. It seems to have been an experiment\r\nat artificial decoration which has not been repeated. The flatness of\r\nthe ground generally has no doubt set limitations on the work of the\r\nlandscape gardener; and where the space is so large, the natural is\r\nbetter than the artificial landscape.\r\n\r\nOne need not be a botanist to admire the endless variety of the trees\r\nalone—their grotesque trunks and tapering stems; their leaves, so\r\ndivergent in form and structure; the blooms that in season conceal the\r\nwealth of the green by a mass of bright colour, and when the chestnut\r\nspikes break out, Hyde Park can almost rival for a week or two the\r\nfamous avenue in Bushey Park.\r\n\r\nEarlier in the year, when the trees are throwing out their fresh green\r\nleaves, the almond blossom glows, the grass looks fresh, and the\r\ndaffodils and narcissi give hope of coming achievement. Possibly Hyde\r\nPark possesses no trees so ancestral as the old elm which stands on\r\nthe edge of the lake in the neighbourhood of St. James’s Park, beneath\r\nwhich the monks at Westminster are said to have fished for a Friday’s\r\nmeal. It still bears leaves, and though its roots are plastered up,\r\nseems likely to thrive for many years. But there is at least one\r\npatriarch, an old oak stump covered with ivy, on the right side of the\r\nwater near the superintendent’s house, to which an interesting story\r\nattaches. It is said that the tree was raised from an acorn gathered\r\nfrom the celebrated Boscobel oak, in which Charles II. concealed\r\nhimself after the battle of Worcester in 1651. Held up by props, with\r\nits trunk devoid of bark, and cracked in all directions, it survives as\r\na relic of bygone days.\r\n\r\nEvery kind of tree is here,—the elm, the lime, the beech, the common\r\nash, the plane, and many besides. No tree flourishes so well in London\r\nas the plane, which will grow in little soil, and seems to possess\r\na marvellous capacity for withstanding drought. It attains a great\r\nheight, has a wide-spreading head, a massive trunk, and sheds the\r\nbark, which falls off in large irregular patches every year, giving a\r\nstriking character to the tree. Not only hardy, the plane is one of the\r\nmost attractive of all trees.\r\n\r\nThere are also some fine copper beeches. A young German who was\r\nin London was much impressed by all he saw, and one day at his\r\nboarding-house he waxed warm on the beautiful vegetation in Hyde Park,\r\nwhich he rightly designated as “the best in the world.”\r\n\r\n“The ladies are lovely,” he said. “I do not know which are the most\r\nlovely, the ladies or the bloody beeches.”\r\n\r\nNaturally everybody looked surprised, until it was explained that\r\n_copper beeches_ in German are called _blutbuche_, which the German had\r\nliterally translated into _bloody beeches_.\r\n\r\nShrubs have been planted in endless variety, and—when the tree trunks\r\nstand out bare and bleak in winter, and the branches are leafless—give\r\nto the walks a pleasant bordering of green. The particular glory of the\r\nPark shrubs is to be found in the rhododendrons, which in the weeks\r\nwhen they are in full bloom are alone worth coming to London to see.\r\nRotten Row spreads out a narrow line of tan, bordered with a perfect\r\nblaze of colour. One need travel far to find another such gorgeous\r\nsetting as this. Our Austrian critic hardly does full justice to the\r\nPark when writing of it as possessing “only something approaching a\r\ngarden at its gates.” True, most of the ground retains the character of\r\nan English heath; but surely that is a big garden which stretches along\r\nPark Lane from Hyde Park Corner to the Marble Arch, and again from the\r\nMarble Arch to the Serpentine. Some of the beds are very fine. Fashions\r\nchange even in gardening, and it is true that we see little nowadays\r\nof the elaborate designs in “carpet bedding” which was once so much\r\nthe vogue. Its stiff formality has gone, and more natural combinations\r\nare seen, which give equally pleasant and less gaudy effects. Harmony\r\nin form and colour, both in foliage and flowers, is the object sought,\r\nand as green is the predominating colour in nature, restful to the eye,\r\nrefreshing and enlivening, it is chosen as the groundwork to the design.\r\n\r\nA typical bed laid out in 1906 in varying shades of green and violet\r\nwas very effective. As these are matters in which amateurs easily\r\nmisunderstand, I quote expert descriptions.\r\n\r\nThis particular bed was composed of verbena venosa, violet-coloured;\r\nkochia scoparia, light green foliage plant; gymnothrix latifolia, a\r\nbroad-leaved grass; salvia argentea, silver white; panicum capillaire,\r\na feathery grass, and carpeted with Harrison’s musk. Another dainty\r\ncombination consisted of dark heliotrope, nicotiania affinis, a\r\nwhite-flowered tobacco very fragrant in the evening; tall, trained\r\nplants of canary creeper, which looked very pretty when in bloom;\r\nand an edging of the yellow sanvitalia procumbens. A circular bed in\r\nwhite and gold was made up of the white lilium longiflorum, the golden\r\nHelenium pumilum, and a yellow-stemmed fern. A bed of cannas was edged\r\nwith flower-garden beet, which should have been more bronzy in colour;\r\na round bed in white, scarlet, and gold was composed of hydrangea,\r\nscarlet geraniums, and yellow privet. These were but a few of the\r\ndainties set out for the admiration of the passing throng, and for the\r\ncloser study of the enthusiast, who may always find in the parks, ideas\r\nto carry away with him for development in the smaller space of his\r\nown gardens. I asked Major Hussey, of His Majesty’s Office of Works,\r\nwhat shrubs and plants there were in Hyde Park, and to his courtesy\r\nam indebted for the complete list to be found in an Appendix to this\r\nvolume, the extent of which will no doubt come as a surprise to most\r\npeople. Who imagined there were anything like the number of varieties?\r\n\r\nFancy poaching game in Hyde Park! But so common was the affair in\r\nLondon four centuries ago, that Henry VIII. made a proclamation, in\r\n1546, “to have the games of Hare, Partridge, Pheasants, and Heron\r\npreserved from Westminster Palace to St. Giles’s in the Fields.”\r\n\r\nPigeon shooting was a great sport, and about that time it was\r\nestimated that some two thousand pigeon poachers were at work in the\r\nmetropolis,—Sunday was the great day for setting traps. From two\r\nshillings to five shillings was received for each pigeon; so the game\r\nseems to have been lucrative.\r\n\r\nNature in Hyde Park, the subject of this chapter, would be but poorly\r\ncovered without mention of the birds, which any one fond of an outdoor\r\nlife finds a considerable addition to its delights. Here, again, the\r\nvariety is likely to astound those who have given little thought to the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nThe imported gulls, ducks and geese and moorhens, which number seven\r\nor eight hundred, never wander from the Serpentine, and are always\r\nready to welcome pieces of bread or biscuit, have become the most\r\ndomesticated, and therefore the most commonly known. The wildfowl\r\nlive largely on fish, which accounts for these seldom reaching more\r\nthan three ounces in weight in the Serpentine. There is no place\r\nin the length and breadth of England where birds are so certain of\r\nbeing unmolested as in London, in spite of its six or seven million\r\ninhabitants, and on the whole they thrive well. The health of the\r\ncaptive birds in the Zoological Gardens at Regent’s Park shows that the\r\nsootiness of the air is no hindrance to their prosperity.\r\n\r\nApart from the sparrows, which of course are everywhere, and in the\r\nparks seem to attain their highest development in self-complacency\r\nand impudence, the wild birds most frequently seen are the starlings.\r\nDarker than the sparrow, and two or three times their size, but smaller\r\nthan the speckled thrush, they can readily be identified by their\r\nmovements, as, generally in little droves, they run rapidly over the\r\ngrass with heads down, pecking here and there. A good many thrushes are\r\nalso about, but they are less frequently seen than in St. James’s Park,\r\nwhich for its acreage is perhaps the richest in bird-life of any of the\r\nopen spaces of the Metropolis. This doubtless arises from the fact that\r\nall round the lake, save in one small area, a wide strip of the bank\r\nis railed in and sacred from intrusion by the wayfarer. The thrushes\r\nnest regularly and sing beautifully at times; but they are shy and\r\nunapproachable.\r\n\r\nOther visitors are blackbirds. Less companionable than the starlings,\r\nthey are never seen in droves, but apparently live a solitary life,\r\nand, in cold weather, fieldfares and red-wings arrive. The parks,\r\nhowever, are at no time rich in berries, and their visits are short.\r\nRavens are also welcomed.\r\n\r\nMr. T. Digby Piggott, whose _London Birds_ is one of the most\r\ndelightful books on bird life, mentions that in April one year a pair\r\nof chaffinches were to be seen very busy collecting moss for a nest\r\nbetween Victoria Gate and the fountain. Two blue-tits were at the\r\nsame time carefully investigating the trees close by, evidently with\r\nthe same views. Cole-tits, too, occasionally show themselves in the\r\ngardens. House martins in plenty build about the ornamental waters;\r\nswallows, and more rarely swifts and the little brown sand-martins,\r\nwhich may be seen flying over the surface of the Serpentine, Mr.\r\nPiggott also includes among the residents or casual visitors to Hyde\r\nPark.\r\n\r\nIndeed, many of the birds which formerly haunted the metropolis when\r\nit was smaller—I dissent altogether from the common mis-statement that\r\nold London was cleaner than it is now, chimneys notwithstanding—have of\r\nlate years re-appeared in the parks. No doubt there would be more but\r\nfor the shortage of small insect life.\r\n\r\nAt one time Kensington Gardens was the site of the most populous\r\nrookery in London. In the high trees extending from the Broad Walk near\r\nthe Palace to the Serpentine, where it commences in the Gardens, they\r\nsay there were close upon one hundred nests. When the leaves fell they\r\ncould be seen on the topmost branches, swinging in the wind. The birds\r\nflying hither and thither were objects of interest to every passer-by.\r\n\r\nAlas, they have now practically all disappeared.\r\n\r\nDr. Hamilton, in June 1878, when counting the nests found they had been\r\nreduced to thirty, mostly confined to a few of the upper trees skirting\r\nthe Broad Walk near the North Gate.\r\n\r\nSince that time nearly every tree in the garden that had a nest in it\r\nhas been cut down. Rooks, though often attached for centuries to their\r\nold quarters, when once driven away are with difficulty persuaded to\r\nreturn. The only substantial rookery now left in the heart of the town\r\nis Gray’s Inn, which happily shows no signs of depletion. At times the\r\nbirds may be absent for a week or two, but always re-appear, and there\r\nis quite a numerous colony of them. It is curious that none other of\r\nthe Inns of Court has been able to maintain a rookery; though formerly\r\nthese were quite common in the middle of London.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1907, quite an interesting correspondence on “Birds in\r\nthe Parks” appeared in the _Daily Telegraph_. It grew out of a remark\r\nby a writer in a paper, “it is many a day since a magpie fluttered\r\nin black and white in the heart of London.” Correspondents poured in\r\nletters to testify they had themselves seen the bird, so apparently a\r\nmagpie is not such a rarity in the Metropolis after all.\r\n\r\nA couple of magpies had a nest in the Green Park in June 1906, and\r\nwere often seen in that and the following month. One, at least, visited\r\nSt. James’s Park in the previous year. Another couple of magpies\r\nare recorded in the “Field Club,” a journal edited by that ardent\r\nnaturalist, the Rev. Theodore Wood, which he noticed in the same park\r\nin May 1903.\r\n\r\nMr. A. Withers Green writes that he has for years past seen a couple\r\nof magpies in St. James’s Park flying across from the island to the\r\nmainland. In 1907 they had a nest in a black poplar in the hollow of\r\nthe Green Park, and young ones had been hatched. An old Field-Marshal\r\nis said to feed them daily with hard-boiled eggs.\r\n\r\nNor are the magpies the only ornithological visitors which delight the\r\nheart of the Metropolis, so famous for its bird life.\r\n\r\nIn an interesting article by Mr. A. Collett, that appeared in _The\r\nEvening Standard_, he describes the sparrows and owls in Hyde Park:\r\n\r\n“It is seldom, of course, that a perfectly white sparrow makes its\r\nappearance, but it is not at all uncommon to see one in autumn which\r\nis so strongly splashed and spotted with white among the brown that\r\nit immediately attracts the attention across the whole width of a\r\nsquare garden, and looks more like a snow bunting than the familiar\r\nLondon bird.... When London contains the largest crop of plump young\r\nsparrows, at the end of the nesting-season back come the owls to pick a\r\nbone with them, in no metaphorical sense. There is a hollow elm in one\r\nof the London parks, where every year, from about the end of October\r\nonwards, the ground beneath the largest hole becomes littered with\r\nthe skulls and other indigestible portions of sparrows, cast up (and\r\nthen thrown down) by the owls which engage the tree for the winter.\r\nTo the jauntiest of sparrow bachelors this skull surrounded elm must\r\nseem the very cave of Giant Despair. There is little safety for any\r\nsparrow which chooses to go to roost among the open boughs of the\r\npark trees; and they are only acting in accordance with their natural\r\nself-protective instincts when they flock in chattering multitudes at\r\nsunset to certain well-known points of thick shrubbery, such as the\r\never-greens at the side of the Mall, by Stafford House, and the island\r\nin the Serpentine near the Royal Humane Society’s house.”\r\n\r\nCarrion crows have for some years haunted Kensington Gardens. An early\r\nmorning stroller has described a tragedy which he witnessed a few years\r\nago. A duck was taking its newly-hatched brood to the Serpentine near\r\nthe fountain, when one of the crows tried to seize a young duckling.\r\nThe mother immediately covered them and warded off each attack of the\r\nintruder. The crow, finding that it could not succeed, flew away, and\r\nshortly afterwards returned with its mate. One crow then engaged the\r\nmother’s attention in front, while the other attacked the young from\r\nthe rear, and, although the onlooker to this dastardly proceeding did\r\nall he could to drive the crows away, four of the little ducks were\r\nkilled in an incredibly short time.\r\n\r\nThe same observer adds: “I have constantly visited Kensington Gardens\r\nin the early morning, and four or five years since, in the late\r\nsummer, I saw a cuckoo flying along the paths which run parallel with\r\nthe Bayswater Road. Last winter, in a rather foggy morning, I saw\r\na sparrow-hawk in the Gardens, evidently by its manner a stranger;\r\nand two years ago, in November, I saw a perfectly pure albino cock\r\nblackbird flying into the island near the boat-house. I was within\r\nthree or four yards of him. It was busy on the ground, but as it flew,\r\nit uttered the unmistakable cry which a cock blackbird gives on being\r\ndisturbed.”\r\n\r\nThere was a curious legend that long prevailed in country districts,\r\nthat the cuckoo of summer turned into a sparrow-hawk in winter, and\r\nback again into a cuckoo in the spring. On 21st August 1895, there was\r\nthe rare appearance of “a cuckoo flying up and down a London street,\r\nbewildered, sheltering in its limes.”\r\n\r\nIt is excellent news that a kingfisher was recently watched flying\r\nover the Serpentine, though it is too much to hope that the bird of\r\nbrilliant plumage will ever leave its favourite solitudes for the\r\nstreams of the town.\r\n\r\nBats haunt the parks in the dusk of night.\r\n\r\n“There is at least one tree in Kensington Gardens,” says Mr. Digby\r\nPigott, “an old hollow oak between the refreshment-room and the\r\ngardener’s cottage,—which is the home of a considerable colony of bats.\r\nA note was made of the exact hour at which the long silent procession\r\nleft the hole one evening in August. The next day, within four minutes\r\nof the same time—the time was carefully taken—seventeen bats crawled\r\nup, and with the same regular intervals took headers into the dusk, to\r\nappear again as if they had started from another quarter altogether,\r\ncareering about over the tops of the trees, doing the best they could\r\nto prevent too great an increase of humbler London night fliers.”\r\n\r\nIt seems that we have not yet realised the full uses to which the parks\r\nmight be put. Many people have their own ideas, and the authorities\r\nare constantly being bombarded with applications from one person or\r\nanother, who desires to have a portion of the Park given over to his—or\r\nmore frequently her—particular purposes.\r\n\r\nOne good lady, representing a Woman’s Temperance Society, wished to\r\nhave a bandstand handed over to her when not occupied by the musicians,\r\nfor meetings “for the public good.”\r\n\r\nRequests have been made by charitable agencies, that the parks might be\r\nutilised to provide special sleeping accommodation for the unemployed.\r\n\r\nA novelty in horrors was suggested by an application to hold a\r\n“Gramophone Gospel Service.”\r\n\r\nA gentleman wanted a pond filled in because his wife had been stung by\r\nan insect, and he was afraid of malaria; while a lady wished to use one\r\nof the ornamental waters to exercise her ducklings.\r\n\r\nA finer imagination still was displayed by a noble lord, who directed\r\nhis secretary to write asking for the use of the York Water Gate, now\r\nhalf buried in Embankment Gardens, as a smoking-room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE EVOLUTION OF THE CARRIAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch a reformation in vehicular traffic has taken place in Hyde Park\r\nin the first years of the twentieth century, that it seems worth\r\ntracing roughly the means of progression from the Roman car of two\r\nthousand years ago to the electric landaulette of to-day, and from the\r\npack-horse to the snorting motor cycles.\r\n\r\nPractically, every surviving method of locomotion has heralded\r\nits earliest votaries within the precincts of the Park, where the\r\nfoot-propelled “hobby-horse” proved the forerunner of the bicycle.\r\nThe first two-cylinder motors were tried—little cars which have since\r\ndeveloped into the huge travelling cars almost like railway carriages\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nIt is amusing to watch the disappearance from the roads of our dear\r\nold wooden box on wheels,—politely called an omnibus—besmirched by\r\nadvertisements until its destination is difficult to decipher. The\r\nhorse omnibus has been largely superseded by the motor bus,—still in\r\nits infancy, judging by its breakdowns, its noises, and its smells,—and\r\nthe lumbering carts of former years are giving place to whole trains of\r\nrattling vans headed by a puffing engine, which parade our streets to\r\nthe misery of those on foot, and the positive terror of the aged and\r\nthe young.\r\n\r\nUnder the rule of the Anglo-Saxons, horsemanship was a skilled art. The\r\nyouthful noble was bold in war and fleet in chase.\r\n\r\nHorses were used for travel by the upper classes, while the lower\r\norders journeyed on foot. A representation of two Saxon travellers,\r\nwhich occurs in the Cotton MSS., shows the lady sitting sideways in a\r\nkind of chair with her feet resting on a board, very similar to the\r\narrangement adapted in later years for the lady riding pillion fashion,\r\nand still in use in Iceland and Ireland. It was a position which\r\nprevented the poor woman acquiring any power over her steed, or even\r\nfeeling secure in her seat, yet it is repeatedly seen in illuminated\r\nmanuscripts of the period.\r\n\r\nThe Saxons also had chariots for travelling, but they were only used by\r\nthe wealthy, and together with agricultural carts were termed “wœgn” or\r\n“wœn” (from which words our “waggon” is derived) and “crat” or “cræt,”\r\nhence our word “cart.” These chariots which are represented as a square\r\nbox, the shape of our ordinary farm cart, without any front, were hung\r\nlow on two wheels, and drawn by a couple of horses. There is another\r\ndrawing of one with four wheels, but neither vehicle was used except by\r\ngrand ladies or invalids, and horses were not even acquired by Church\r\ndignitaries in those early days.\r\n\r\nHow quaint it would be to see one of these curious old waggons being\r\nled through Hyde Park to-day, and how amazing for those people of the\r\npast to see a carriage moving without a horse.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the Saxon period, the influence of Normandy\r\npermeated the English Court, and a great love of display spread among\r\nthe nobles, who, from the time of Edmund Ironsides, gradually adopted\r\nContinental customs, entirely unknown in the Courts of the early Saxons.\r\n\r\nWith the Normans came the age of chivalry. Costly apparel and huge\r\nretinues did much to increase the state of the noble. In time of war\r\nthe _tenants-in-capite_ and the _tenants paravail_ had each to produce\r\na certain number of armed men, according to his rank, and thus the\r\ngreat lord had the means at his hand not only to summon a troop in\r\ncase of need, but also a courtly retinue in time of pleasure or grand\r\nceremonial.\r\n\r\nThe custom of travelling with an army of retainers had other\r\njustification than that of mere display. In the days of the early\r\nPlantagenets the King’s highway was infested with robbers; not the\r\nwild highwaymen of later days, but oft-times a princely youth, who,\r\nfrom the fastness of his castle-home, dashed out to scour the country\r\nround, seeking what he might confiscate, and woe to the hapless\r\ntraveller pursuing his lonely journey. Two other classes of robbers\r\nwere comprised of outlaws driven to despair by the cruel forest laws,\r\nand the bands of men returned from the Crusades, who had originally\r\nsold their belongings in order to join the holy war, and had come back\r\npenniless.\r\n\r\nThe horse-litter was also in use. In fact, it seems to have come down\r\nfrom untold ages, for it is mentioned in the Book of Isaiah, and was\r\nevidently introduced from the south, probably brought to England by\r\nsome of the Crusaders. It consisted of a kind of coach slung between\r\ntwo horses, and was chiefly employed for carrying the sick and aged,\r\nand on State journeys or at funerals. Professor Markland, writing in\r\n1821, says: “In Sicily there is no way of travelling through mountain\r\npasses but in a ‘legia.’” However, that must have died out, for in\r\n1904, when travelling all over Sicily, I never saw a single one of\r\nthese palanquins, and we just used horses when we could not drive.\r\n\r\nLadies generally rode on mules. They accompanied their lords on many\r\nof their hunting expeditions, and joined in their pursuits in the\r\nNorman and Plantagenet periods. The greyhound was a favourite dog\r\namongst them. It is evident, too, that women went out hunting on their\r\nown account, and on these occasions they adopted the custom of riding\r\nastride; as the chair arrangement rigged up on one side was anything\r\nbut safe. Strutt, in his _Sports and Pastimes_, gives a reproduction of\r\nan illumination from an early fourteenth-century MS., where a lady is\r\nrepresented riding crossways, winding the horn and pursuing game, while\r\nanother is shooting with a bow and arrow. Women are reported to have\r\nbeen more versed in falconry than their lords, although they generally\r\nfollowed this sport on foot, and chiefly sought waterfowl.\r\n\r\nAs is well known, side saddles were only introduced into England by\r\nAnne of Bohemia. Now we are reverting to the cross saddle for women\r\nused by our forbears.\r\n\r\nAn outcome of the Crusades was the introduction of Arab steeds.\r\nNormandy itself was also famous for a splendid breed of horses. The\r\ngreatest mark of appreciation known was to present a Normandy horse,\r\nand the most tempting form of bribe was the gift of a prancing Arab\r\npalfrey or noble charger. King John accepted horses in exchange for\r\ngrants of land, and in payment of feudal rights. At that time, and in\r\nthe reign of Edward I., the price of horses ranged from one to ten\r\npounds. The animals were richly caparisoned, and wore bells—sometimes\r\nnumbering several hundreds—on their harness, and particularly on the\r\nbridle. In fact, the trappings were often worth more than the steed,\r\njust as is the case on the ranches of Mexico to-day, where the value of\r\nthe Mexican saddle is probably ten times that of the horse.\r\n\r\nWhips were used by ladies and the lower orders, but the nobles relied\r\nentirely upon the spur.\r\n\r\nDuring the fourteenth century horseback was still the favourite\r\nmeans of getting about, although there were vehicles on wheels\r\nknown under the names of “chares,” “cars,” “chariots,” “caroches,”\r\nand “whirlicotes.” The roads until Elizabeth’s time were of almost\r\ninconceivable badness.\r\n\r\nThe mother of Richard II. is recorded as using a “chare” and a\r\n“whirlicote,” when in the disturbances of 1381 she had to travel from\r\nplace to place, and on account of her age she was thus accommodated;\r\nbut Stow remarks that the introduction of the side-saddle by Anne of\r\nBohemia was displacing the whirlicote except on State and ceremonial\r\noccasions. Anne granted forty shillings a year to her “pourvoioir de\r\nnoz chariettes.” But such “chariettes” were merely cumbersome waggons\r\nto which strong horses were attached. Priests rode at the head of\r\ntroops and at pageants, and were some of the greatest equestrians of\r\nthe age; the monks from Westminster enjoyed many a gallop in Hyde Park.\r\n\r\nIt was a bad time for wayfarers, this of the Middle Ages. Accommodation\r\nwas lacking, provisions were scarce, and often they were overtaken\r\nby nightfall with no hostelry of any kind at hand. Travelling itself\r\nwas dangerous in the turbulent state of the country, and, in fact,\r\nthe highways were considered so unsafe that in 1285 a law was passed,\r\nenacting that all shrubs and trees were to be cut down for two hundred\r\nfeet from the roadside between market towns, to allow no cover for\r\nrobbers. People journeying along the same road had a custom of joining\r\ntogether in order to form a party of sufficient strength to defy\r\nattack, as Chaucer describes in the _Canterbury Tales_. To those who\r\ncould not afford a horse the danger was tenfold. If encumbered with\r\nbaggage or their family, the men often took a mule to carry their\r\npackages or give their wives and children a rest.\r\n\r\nLittle bands of travellers were made up in the City of London, and\r\nstarted in company through the wilds of Tyburn to reach Oxford, or\r\nsome of the northern towns. Such caravans continually passed along the\r\nBayswater Road or Knightsbridge.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to realise what these journeys meant, when every\r\nnecessary or comfort the wayfarer required had to be carried on his\r\nshoulders, or borne in his pack. The modern match was represented by\r\nflint and steel; money was often in specie or in kind. The wretched\r\ntraveller must take food for several days, or go provided with bow and\r\narrow, spear and cooking utensils, to kill and cook his food, or else\r\neat it raw. Materials for a bed had to be carried if he would have one,\r\nand a tent if he objected to sleeping in the open. But these evils were\r\noften mitigated by the kindly hospitality in the age of chivalry, and\r\nwhich extended into the fifteenth century.\r\n\r\nRough waggons came more into use, but the pack-horse long remained\r\nthe chief mode of conveyance. Illustrations of the time show a cart\r\nresembling our present miller’s van in shape, drawn by two horses\r\ntandem-fashion, but led, not driven. Large trains of attendants were\r\nmore than ever in request, for robbery became worse than before.\r\n\r\nIn the Earl of Northumberland’s _Household Book_ an account is given of\r\nhis moving his possessions from place to place; for in the olden days\r\nhabitations, if a man possessed more than one, were not furnished, and\r\nnot only personal effects had to be transferred, but beds and tables as\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nEven kings when going from one place to another took their furniture.\r\nThe most wonderful thing is how dexterously these removals were\r\naccomplished, especially at the French Court, which, at the time of\r\nCatharine de Medici and subsequently, was ever on the move, travelling\r\nbetween Paris and the many castles on the Loire. The coach (really\r\na room on wheels) was for the use of the King and Queen, and other\r\nconveyances, numbering a hundred or more, followed in the wake.\r\n\r\nMany records survive from the Tudor period of State ceremonials in\r\nwhich the old horse-litter played a conspicuous part. Catharine of\r\nArragon entered London in one of these, when she came to England to\r\nwed Prince Arthur, the elder brother of Henry VIII., who died soon\r\nafter the marriage. There are so many people in England who remember\r\nthe magnificent, and withal comfortable, processions for the marriage\r\nfestivities of King Edward and Queen Alexandra, the Jubilee processions\r\nof Queen Victoria, and the Coronation of our reigning Monarch and his\r\nConsort, that the following entries of arrangements for the reception\r\nof Princess Catharine four hundred years ago, made in the Duke of\r\nNorthumberland’s _Household Book_, may be of interest as a contrast:\r\n\r\n“_Item_, That a rich litter be ready to receive and convey the said\r\nPrincess to the door of the Church of St. Paul’s.\r\n\r\n“_Item_, That three horsemen in side-saddle and harness all of one\r\nsuit, be arrayed by the Master of the Queen’s Horse to follow next to\r\nthe said Princesses litter.\r\n\r\n“_Item_, That a fair palfrey with a pillion richly arrayed and led in\r\nhand for the said Princess, do follow next unto the said horsemen.\r\n\r\n“_Item_, That five charres diversely apparelled for the ladies and\r\ngentlemen, be ready at the same time at the same Tower, whereof one\r\nof the chief must be richly apparelled and garnished for the said\r\nPrincess, and the other four to serve such ladies as be appointed by\r\nthe Queen’s Chamberlain.”\r\n\r\nAt Catharine’s Coronation with Henry VIII., “chariots covered, with\r\nladies therein,” followed her litter; and when Anne Boleyn came to\r\nLondon she made a State entry in a most wonderful litter ornamented\r\nwith the richest materials.\r\n\r\nWhen Margaret Tudor, sister of Henry VIII., went to Scotland, whose\r\nKing James IV. she married, she was conveyed “on varey rich litere,\r\nborne by two fair coursers vary nobly drest, in the wich litere the\r\nsayd queene was borne in the intryng of townes, or otherways to her\r\ngood playsure.”\r\n\r\nCan one imagine anything more horrible than being swung about in a\r\nlitter for weeks as that poor woman was on her journey from London to\r\nScotland? The bumps and shakes, the discomfort of the cramped position,\r\nseem terrible to think of in these days of Pulman cars, restaurants,\r\nand quick trains.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of the sixteenth century riding pillion fashion was again\r\nmuch in vogue, the lady sitting behind the gentleman, in a kind of\r\nchair similar to that used by the Anglo-Saxon dames. They called the\r\nboard for their feet a “planchette.”\r\n\r\nQueen Mary Tudor went from the Tower to Westminster at her Coronation\r\n“sitting in a chariot of cloth of tissue drawn with six horses,”\r\nfollowed by another chariot “with cloth of silver” and six horses, in\r\nwhich sat Anne of Cleves and the Princess Elizabeth. Great Queen Bess,\r\nwhen it came to her turn to be crowned, also used a chariot for her\r\nState procession to the Abbey.\r\n\r\nThe coach is said to have been introduced in 1564 by Boonen, a Dutch\r\ncoachman employed by Queen Elizabeth, who enjoyed her first drives\r\nand the pleasures of her new possession in London’s spacious parks.\r\nThese equipages were almost too gorgeous for description. The Queen\r\nseems to have employed them at times in her different progresses and\r\nfor her State entries, but her chief mode of locomotion was riding on\r\nhorseback. This was undoubtedly on account of the dreadful state of the\r\nroads, which rendered impossible the common use of the coach in the\r\ncountry for some years. In fact, in London itself, the streets were so\r\nnarrow, so ill-kept, and so uneven, that it was a very jolting business\r\nto drive at all.\r\n\r\nElizabeth’s coach was generally drawn by two white horses, was gaudily\r\ndecorated, and had a canopy, but was open at the sides. The driver\r\nsat on a kind of narrow chair close behind the horses, and rather low\r\ndown. The Queen _liked_ to be the only lady in the land to ride in such\r\na vehicle, and her jealousy was so aroused when the ladies of London\r\nthought to follow suit, that she became irate, and actually passed\r\na law “to restrain the excessive use of coaches.” In spite of this\r\nlegislation and the bad state of the roads, so many people ordered\r\nthese equipages that there was soon an actual dearth of leather to\r\ncover them, just as there is scarcity of rubber for tyres of motors\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nD’Avenant, writing of the gay Metropolis at this time, says: “Surely\r\nyour ancestors contrived your narrow streets in the days of the\r\nwheelbarrow, before the greater engines, carts, were invented.” Mary\r\nQueen of Scots, unlike Elizabeth, seems to have ridden on all her\r\njourneys.\r\n\r\nThe first public vehicles were, according to Stow, started in 1564, and\r\nwere called “caravans.” Forty years later, one of these was running\r\nbetween London and Canterbury, and a patent was granted to a man to run\r\na stage-coach on the little trip between Edinburgh and Leith.\r\n\r\nThe reign of James I. also saw the pioneer hackney coach in London. A\r\nfew years afterwards the first “rank” was established, when a Captain\r\nBaily acquired four hackney coaches and made them stand at the Maypole\r\n(near St. Mary’s in the Strand) for hire. Skeats derives the word\r\n“hackney” from two Dutch words, meaning a “jolting nag”—the old way of\r\nspelling it was “hacquenée.” The coachman rode his horse, postillion\r\nfashion, and used whip and spurs. There was constant rivalry between\r\nthe chairmen of the sedans and coachmen of that age, and good-humoured\r\nchaff and jeers were bandied from one to another as freely as between\r\nthe omnibus drivers and chauffeurs of motor cars to-day.\r\n\r\nMany transformations have taken place since the first hackney carriage\r\nplied for hire in 1615 and the advent of the first public motor cab\r\nat Hyde Park Corner in 1906. It was several months before the first\r\nhandful of these were augmented by an addition of five hundred, with\r\nthe pleasing joys of the taximeter.\r\n\r\nThe next novelty for getting about was the sedan-chair.\r\n\r\nOn the return of Prince Charles (aferwards Charles I.) from the Court\r\nof Spain, he brought four back with him, and gave one to the Duke\r\nof Buckingham, “his dear Steenie,” who was hooted when he appeared\r\nin it in the streets. The chairs were very unpopular, as the people\r\nobjected to see men employed as beasts of burden. However, when it was\r\nunderstood that letting them on hire might prove profitable, they were\r\nat once adopted.\r\n\r\nOddly enough, the streets of the old Moorish town of Tangier to-day\r\nresemble London of the sixteenth century. That is to say, they are so\r\nnarrow, so badly paved, so weird, that no vehicle can drive through\r\nthem. Therefore anyone, who can afford a beast of any kind, rides. Only\r\nthe very poorest are on foot, and there the sedan-chair still survives.\r\n\r\nGoing out to dinner in evening-dress on horseback is somewhat\r\ndisarranging to a woman; therefore one is carried in this fashion. Well\r\ndo I remember, in 1898, four terrible-looking Jews arriving in the\r\nhall of the hotel, and bidding me enter a chair. I did, and shaking\r\nand wobbling from side to side was borne out to a dinner-party. No\r\nMohammedan would lower himself to carry a Christian, and Jews therefore\r\nperform the office—nice, cut-throat-looking villains they appear, too.\r\nThe office of chairman is looked upon as _infra dig._, just as it was\r\nin London in the seventeenth century. There are only three or four\r\nsedan-chairs in Tangier, and consequently, on party-nights they are in\r\nmuch demand, and some of the guests arrive too early and some too late,\r\nfor all the women have to be borne to their destination by such means.\r\n\r\nA patent was granted to Sir Sanders Duncombe in 1634, extending over\r\nfourteen years, for letting sedan chairs out on hire, and the preamble\r\nstates that it was for the purpose of lessening the danger of the\r\nstreets which were so “encumbered and pestered” with the coaches of the\r\nday. Before the end of the century these chairs were looked upon as an\r\nabsolute necessity. Ladies shopped in them, called on their friends,\r\nwent to parties, to theatres—in fact, they were quite the fashion, and\r\nheld their own for many years to come.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of James I. the nobility alone were allowed to drive four\r\nhorses, so the Duke of Buckingham, ever ready to outdo everyone else\r\nin the matter of fashion and up-to-dateness, started a coach-and-six,\r\nbut such was the extravagant rivalry of the age that the Duke of\r\nNorthumberland shortly afterwards drove a coach-and-eight. It is said\r\nthat in the neighbourhood of London in 1638 six thousand coaches were\r\nkept.\r\n\r\nAs coaches denoted exalted rank, everyone naturally wanted to drive\r\none. But, alas! the twentieth century has sounded their knell. Those\r\ndelightful meets held in the summer months at the Magazine in Hyde\r\nPark, when the Four-in-Hand and Coaching Club muster twenty or thirty\r\ncoaches each time, drive round the Park, then off to Hurlingham or\r\nRanelagh to lunch, are coming to an end. Motors are hustling coaches\r\noff the road, and already the two famous Polo Clubs outside London are\r\ninstituting automobile races and shows, because the entries for the\r\ncoaches have dwindled so terribly, while for the former they have gone\r\nup by bounds in a few years. Horses are already threatened.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of their introduction, private coaches were richly\r\ncaparisoned. Among the State papers there is a queer old record against\r\nMay Day, 1637, of three accounts:\r\n\r\nOne is of £1326, 1s. 8d. for gold and silk laces and fringes delivered\r\nfor the King’s service in the stables in 1633; another for £374, 12s.\r\n11d. for gold and silver fringe for making a “caroch” for the Queen\r\n“against May Day, 1636”; and a third account of £168, 7s. 8d. for suits\r\nand cloaks for the footmen, coachmen, and postillions of the Queen\r\n“against May Day.”\r\n\r\nAs the coaches gained favour the horse-litter gradually died out.\r\nWhen Queen Henrietta Maria’s mother came from France to visit her in\r\n1638, she entered London in a litter embroidered with gold and borne\r\nby two mules, but her journey from Harwich had been accomplished by\r\ncoach. Evelyn also says that he used one in 1640, when he took his aged\r\nfather from Bath to Wootton. There is one more mention of the litter\r\nin Charles II.’s reign, but with so many wheeled vehicles coming into\r\ndaily use, no wonder this means of locomotion ceased.\r\n\r\nHowever, the coaches did not altogether bring joy to the traveller.\r\nEvelyn, in his _Character of England_, published in 1659, is full of\r\nindignation at the reception the coach riders endured at the hands of\r\nthe populace.\r\n\r\n“Arrived at the metropolis of Civility, London, we put ourselves in\r\ncoach with some persons of quality, who came to conduct us to our\r\nlodging, but neither was this passage without honour done to us: the\r\nkennel-dirt, squibs, roots, and ram-horns, being favours which were\r\nfrequently cast at us by the children and apprentices, without reproof.\r\nCivilities that, in Paris, a gentleman as seldom meets withal, as with\r\nthe contests of carmen, who in this town domineer in the streets,\r\no’erthrow the hell-carts (for so they name the coaches), cursing and\r\nreviling at the nobles. You would imagine yourselves amongst a legion\r\nof devils and in the suburbs of hell.\r\n\r\n“I have greatly marvelled at the remissness of the magistrates and\r\nthe temper of the gentlemen; and that the citizens, who submit only\r\nupon them, should permit so great a disorder; rather joining in the\r\naffronts, than at all chastising the inhumanity.”\r\n\r\nBy the middle of the seventeenth century a regular system of\r\nstage-coaches seems to have been installed. In 1661 the journey between\r\nLondon and Oxford occupied two whole days.\r\n\r\nA coach called “The Flying Dutchman” was also put upon the road, which\r\naccomplished the journey in thirteen hours, but for some reason or\r\nother, we find that in 1692 the distance again occupied two days. In\r\n1682 the trip between London and Nottingham required four days in\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nThese coaches were probably uncovered, and had projections at the sides\r\nknown as the _boot_, in which the passengers sat with their backs\r\nto the carriage. A coach with four horses carried six travellers;\r\nthe caravan with four or five horses took twenty-five. The coachman\r\nsometimes drove and sometimes rode as postillion. The fare from London\r\nto Exeter, Chester, or York was 40s. in summer, 45s. in winter, and\r\nthe journey took eight days in summer and twelve in winter. Therefore\r\nstage-coaches were beyond the reach of the poor.\r\n\r\nCoaches still run between London and Oxford, and in the summer people\r\nclamour for places for this lovely drive of fifty-two miles, now\r\naccomplished in a few hours, through some quaint old villages and\r\npretty lanes.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing more pleasing to the artistic eye, or more interesting\r\nto the historian, than a driving tour through rural England. Our\r\nvillages are unique. We welcome motors as a means of getting about,\r\nbut are glad an enterprising young American is going to try and revive\r\nLondon coaching in our midst. It is, of course, still popular in Devon,\r\nCornwall, the Lakes, and Scotland; in the country districts, in fact,\r\nfor summer tourists.\r\n\r\nI have included here a reproduction of the card of one of the public\r\ncoaches running out of London in 1906, for it promises soon to have an\r\nantiquarian interest. Every summer morning for years past these coaches\r\nhave left Piccadilly, and lately, Northumberland Avenue, for Brighton,\r\nDorking, Windsor, and elsewhere. Now the motor is killing all that, and\r\nin a year or two, probably, the last surviving opportunity of coaching\r\ninto the country will be gone. These old cards seem therefore worth\r\npreserving.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OLD ESTABLISHED\r\n\r\nDorking Coach\r\n\r\n“PERSEVERANCE,”\r\n\r\nLeaves HOTEL METROPOLE, Northumberland Avenue,\r\n\r\nAt _10.30_ a.m.\r\n\r\nAND\r\n\r\nReturns from the WHITE HORSE HOTEL, DORKING,\r\n\r\nAt _3.15_ p.m.\r\n\r\nEVERY DAY (Sundays excepted).\r\n\r\n  ------+----------------------+------\r\n  Fares |       LEAVING        |\r\n  ------+----------------------+------\r\n  s. d. |                      |  A.M.\r\n        | “Hotel Metropole”    | 10.30\r\n        |                      |\r\n   2  6 | * Roehampton         | 11.30\r\n        |     “King’s Head”    |\r\n        |                      |\r\n   4  6 | Kingston             | 12. 5\r\n        |                      |\r\n   5  0 | Surbiton             | 12.15\r\n        |                      |\r\n   5  6 | * Hook               | 12.25\r\n        |     “North Star”     |\r\n        |                      |\r\n   6  6 | * Epsom              |  1.0\r\n        |                      |\r\n   7  6 | Leatherhead          |  1.28\r\n        |     “Swan Hotel”     |\r\n        |                      |\r\n   8  6 | Mickleham            |  1.40\r\n        |                      |\r\n   9  0 | Boxhill              |  1.50\r\n        | “Burford Bdg.

Crossing Parliament Square we enter\r\nSt. James’s Park, and, following Birdcage Walk to Buckingham Palace,\r\nturn from it into _Belgravia_ and Eaton Square. At Sloane Square we\r\nenter _Chelsea_, the “Village of Palaces,” one of the most interesting\r\ndistricts of London, and, passing in front of the Duke of York’s\r\nSchool, Chelsea Hospital, and the old “Physic Garden,” we see in Cheyne\r\nWalk some fine Georgian houses that have been the homes of a host of\r\ncelebrities, including “George Eliot,” Rossetti, Maclise, etc. Old\r\nChelsea Church, of world-wide fame, is passed, and a little later we\r\nenter _Fulham_. By the King’s Road and _Parson’s Green_ we cross this\r\ninteresting district, leaving it by the handsome Putney Bridge, that\r\ntakes us across the river. Through Putney and _Barnes Common_ we come\r\nto a more rural district, and at the end of a charming country lane,\r\nenter the old Royal hunting-ground of _Richmond Park_. Our road through\r\nthis magnificent stretch of wood and common is nearly four miles in\r\nlength, and it will be found one of the most pleasant features of the\r\nday’s drive. Emerging into Norbiton, we soon reach the old town of\r\n_Kingston-on-Thames_, that over a thousand years ago was the principal\r\ncity of Saxon England. Again crossing the River Thames, we pass through\r\nHampton Wick and along a fine tree-arched road to _The Palace of\r\nHampton Court_.\r\n\r\n“Here, after lunch, the splendid pile of buildings with its magnificent\r\ncourtyards is explored, and a tour made of the Picture Galleries\r\nand principal State Apartments. It would be difficult to exaggerate\r\nthe interest and beauty of the whole place. The Palace where Wolsey\r\nentertained with such princely hospitality as to arouse the jealousy of\r\nhis master, Henry VIII., later witnessed the festivities and receptions\r\nby successive Kings and Queens, each extending or beautifying the\r\nbuildings, until William of Orange practically completed the whole by\r\nthe huge additions that he made. It is these successive growths upon\r\nthe original structure that form so unique a feature of the edifice,\r\nand the stay here will provide a wealth of pleasant memories. The\r\nGardens, famous for their old-fashioned charm and wealth of flowers,\r\nwill also be visited.\r\n\r\n“The return drive, although made by an entirely different route, is\r\nas charming for the natural beauty of the districts passed, and as\r\ninteresting for the sites and buildings seen, as the outward journey.\r\nEntering _Bushey Park_, we pass down the whole length of the glorious\r\nChestnut Avenue, that in length and uniformity is without a rival. In\r\nthe pretty town of _Teddington_ we see its old ivy-covered church, and\r\nfrom _Strawberry Vale_ obtain a view of Strawberry Hill, the fantastic\r\nresidence of the famous wit, Horace Walpole. Along Cross Deep we pass\r\nmany old mansions of the eighteenth century, and the garden and site\r\nof Pope’s Villa. Emerging into _Twickenham_, we continue through its\r\nquaint Church Street past the church where many celebrities are buried,\r\nand by the Richmond Road come to the old stone bridge, by which we\r\ncross the Thames into the celebrated riverside town of _Richmond_. When\r\nclear of its narrow streets we enter the Kew Road, along which extend\r\nthe Old Deer Park and the world-famous _Botanic Gardens_, whose beauty\r\nand charm have long been unrivalled. After a short visit we continue\r\nacross old-fashioned _Kew Green_, to the handsome Edward VII. bridge,\r\nand crossing the river for the fourth and last time soon pass through\r\nthe pleasant district of _Gunnersbury_. At _Turnham Green_ we pass from\r\nthe main road into Duke’s Avenue leading to Chiswick House, and by\r\nwhich we reach Hogarth Lane, where stands the artist’s residence.\r\n\r\n“Continuing into _old Chiswick_, we come within sight of his tomb in\r\nthe churchyard. The Mall along the river bank, and the narrow street\r\nwe have taken to reach it, form one of the most picturesque parts of\r\nOld London, a “Sleepy Hollow” that has altered little in the last two\r\nhundred years. We return to the main road at _Hammersmith_, and through\r\nits broad avenues come to _Kensington_, then Hyde Park, and so along\r\nPiccadilly, Leicester Square, and the Strand, to our starting-point,\r\nwhich is reached about 5.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n  “_A competent guide_ will accompany the party, pay the necessary\r\n  admission fees, and point out the various buildings and sites of\r\n  interest passed _en route_.\r\n\r\n  “_Luncheon_ is included, consisting of Soup, Fish, Joint or Poultry,\r\n  Vegetables, Sweets, and Cheese.\r\n\r\n  “_Book early._ In order that the necessary conveyances can be\r\n  arranged, passengers are requested to take tickets not later than 6\r\n  p.m. the previous day. _The conveyances are provided with coverings\r\n  in case of wet weather._ Should fewer than four passengers be booked,\r\n  or should the weather or other circumstances be unfavourable, the\r\n  right is reserved to alter the date of the excursion.”\r\n\r\nCount de Grammont gave Charles II. a _calash_ as a present, which cost\r\nhim two thousand guineas; it put every other vehicle in the shade by\r\nits elegance. The Queen and the Duchess of York first drove in it in\r\nthe Park. Then began a terrible rivalry between Lady Castlemaine and\r\nMiss Stewart as to which of them should take precedence in the use of\r\nthe new toy. The beautiful equipage became a source of squabble and\r\ncontention at Court, and finally Miss Stewart was given the honour. She\r\nmay have enjoyed the drive, but did she enjoy the jealousy it awoke?\r\n\r\nWe hear much of “dust” in these motoring days, and many experiments\r\nhave been tried to lay it. Motorists need never despair, though the\r\nproblem is at least two and a half centuries old. Lying in the Public\r\nRecord Office is a warrant issued in 1664 to James Hamilton, the Chief\r\nRanger of Hyde Park, “to water the passage from the gate to where\r\nthe coaches resort in the Park, to avoid the annoyance of dust, much\r\ncomplained of, the expense to be borne by the charge of 6d. on each\r\ncoach; and to prevent all horses coming into the Park except such as\r\nhave gentlemen or livery servants on them, as they cause much dust.”\r\n\r\nPepys apparently suffered with the others, and all through the\r\neighteenth century the favourite sneer of the Press at Hyde Park was\r\nthat people went to “take the dust” there, not the air. For many years\r\na barrel of water used to be placed in a cart, and when it arrived\r\nat the right place, the tap was turned, allowing a single stream to\r\ndescend to the ground. Even our water-carts, that leave the streets\r\ncovered with puddles, to the detriment of all light and dainty skirts\r\non a lovely summer’s day, are an improvement on this, and Hyde Park has\r\nits own carts, stationed in the Store Yard at the back of the Royal\r\nHumane Society’s Lodge.\r\n\r\nIn a quaint paper in the Harleian Miscellany (vol. viii. page 561),\r\nwritten by one who signed himself “A Lover of His Country” (1673),\r\nthere is a long protest against the annoyances of the streets:\r\n\r\n“These coaches [public] and caravans are one of the greatest mischiefs\r\nthat hath happened of late years to the kingdom, mischievous to\r\nthe public, destructive to trade, and prejudicial to lands.... For\r\nformerly, every man that had occasion to travel many journeys yearly,\r\nor to ride up and down, kept horses for himself and servants, and\r\nseldom rid without one or two men: but now, since every man can have a\r\npassage into every place he is to travel to, or to some place within\r\na few miles of that part he designs to go to, they have left keeping\r\nof horses, and travel without servants; and York, Chester, and Exeter\r\nstage-coaches, each of them, with forty horses apiece, carry eighteen\r\npassengers a week from London to either of these places, and in like\r\nmanner, as many in return from these places to London, which come in\r\nthe whole to eighteen hundred seventy-two in the year.\r\n\r\n“... Trade is a great mystery, and one trade depends upon another. Were\r\nit not too tedious, I could show you how many trades there are that go\r\nto the making of every one of the things aforementioned.... For passage\r\nto London being so easy, gentlemen come to London oftener than they\r\nneed, and their ladies either with them, or, having the convenience\r\nof these coaches, quickly follow them. And when they are there, they\r\nmust be in the mode, have all the new fashions, buy all their clothes\r\nthere, and go to plays, balls, and treats, where they get such a habit\r\nof jollity, and a love of gaiety and pleasure, that nothing afterwards\r\nin the country will serve them, if ever they should fix their minds to\r\nlive there again, but they must have all from London whatever it costs.”\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of William III. and Queen Mary, the funny sort of\r\nchair in which the driver sat was discarded, and the box was introduced\r\non the coach. This was always occupied by the coachman, but it had\r\nanother use besides providing a seat for him. After the Great Fire,\r\nthe main London streets were certainly made wider, but they remained\r\nin a dreadful state, and the country roads were even worse. Therefore\r\nin the box were secreted various tools and implements for repairs\r\nshould disaster happen to the coach, amongst them a hammer. As all\r\nthis was very unsightly, it was hidden by a cloth, afterwards known\r\nas the “hammer-cloth”—a name which is retained to this day, though a\r\nhammer has long ceased to be part of the furniture of a smart turn-out:\r\nhammers and endless other instruments are now relegated to the motor\r\ncar.\r\n\r\nThese wonderful old coaches are seldom seen nowadays except at\r\nCoronations, or such-like affairs, but when they are brought out\r\nthey are splendid. The coachman with wig, three-cornered hat, gold\r\nembroideries, silk stockings, and smart livery, sits on his splendidly\r\nembroidered hammer-cloths, while behind the body of the vehicle stand\r\na couple of footmen, almost as gorgeous in attire, holding on for dear\r\nlife to the straps placed for the purpose. The Duke of Devonshire has a\r\nsplendid turn-out of this type, and so have the Marquis of Lansdowne,\r\nthe Duke of Marlborough, and the Duke of Buccleuch.\r\n\r\nSir Gilbert Heathcote was the last Lord Mayor who rode in the Annual\r\nShow on horseback. This was in 1711, but an old custom still exists\r\nof presenting the Aldermen with a mounting-block at their election.\r\nThe Lord Mayor’s coach is a grand relic of the past, with its leather\r\nstraps for springs, and all its gorgeousness; and one cannot but regret\r\nthat, with innovations springing up all round, there is a vision in the\r\nfuture of the old coach being relegated to a quiet corner of one of the\r\nMuseums.\r\n\r\nDistinguished and wealthy people would not at first join the company\r\non the public stage-coach, and either used a hired post-chaise or\r\ntheir own carriage. In the latter case, either four or six horses\r\nwere employed, with a post-boy for every two; footmen sat behind, and\r\na couple of runners dressed in white ran before, each carrying a staff\r\nwith a lemon or orange on the end to quench their thirst.\r\n\r\nSome of the nobility assumed great state when moving from place to\r\nplace. When “the proud Duke of Somerset” of the later Stuart régime\r\nused to travel, he caused the roads to be cleared that he might pass\r\nwithout any delays or exhibitions of rude curiosity. On one occasion\r\nthe servants riding in front of his coach overtook a countryman driving\r\na pig, and in an imperative manner commanded him to be gone. The man\r\nasked the reason.\r\n\r\n“Because my lord Duke of Somerset is coming, and he does not like to be\r\nlooked upon,” was the reply, expecting the rough clown to disappear.\r\n\r\nBut, to the surprise and horror of the Duke’s men, the man stopped\r\naltogether, seized his pig by the ears, and before they could prevent\r\nhim, advanced to the coach, held the animal up to the coach window, and\r\nshouted:\r\n\r\n“I _will_ see him, and, what is more, my pig shall see him too.”\r\n\r\nThe effect of this piece of early socialism is not recorded.\r\n\r\nSo late as 1831 the Earl of Malmesbury writes in his _Memoirs_ that\r\nLord Tankerville (his father-in-law) took him and the Countess of\r\nMalmesbury to Chillingham in a post-chaise drawn by four horses. The\r\ndistance from London was three hundred and thirty miles, and they\r\naccomplished the journey in four days. The roads were terrible, and\r\nthey had a somewhat lively time at the hands of the rioters, in the\r\nReform Bill agitation.\r\n\r\nThe hired post-chaise had two post-boys, the servant sat in the dickey,\r\nand the luggage was strapped to the roof. These vehicles travelled at\r\nabout nine miles an hour, and the horses were changed at every stage.\r\n\r\nStage-coaches themselves were conspicuous by their dull black leather,\r\nstudded with nails. The starting-place and destination of the coach\r\nwere marked on the outside, and the wheels were heavy and cumbersome.\r\nThree horses were generally attached, a postillion being on the first\r\none, and the coachman and guard sat together on the box, the latter\r\nwith his carbine on his knee. In addition to these stage-coaches,\r\ncarriers were despatched on certain days to all the principal places in\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nBut the condition of the roads remained deplorable. In bad weather it\r\noften took a carriage two hours to get from Kensington to St. James’s\r\nPalace, allowing for the time it was stuck in the mud—roughly, a mile’s\r\nprogress an hour. In the year 1765 the leather springs of the Bath\r\ncoach were replaced by steel ones, and so small improvements in the\r\ngeneral construction of carriages have continued.\r\n\r\n_À propos_ of coaches, the Royal Coach, which was built about 1761,\r\nand is always used for the opening of Parliament, Royal weddings,\r\nCoronations, etc., weighs about four tons. It is a wondrous production,\r\nwith golden Tritons on the corners. The coach was designed by Sir\r\nWilliam Chambers, and cost the sum of eight thousand pounds. The\r\npanels were by Cipriani. Those were troublous times, therefore the\r\ncoach was built with steel blinds, that could easily be raised, so as\r\nto divide the occupants from danger, and this probably gave rise to Mr.\r\nFrederic Harrison’s remark that the coach in which the late Queen drove\r\nto open the Great Exhibition was lined with steel.\r\n\r\nThe passion for gorgeous coaches was if anything increasing. Lady Sarah\r\nLennox, writing to Lady Susan O’Brien (the sister of Charles James\r\nFox), describes a chaise she has just sent the latter, over which she\r\nis in great grief. It appears that the most fashionable colour for\r\nPark coaches at this time was grey, mounted with silver. Lady Sarah\r\nordered one accordingly for her friend, but on seeing it she discovered\r\nthe colour was only seen to advantage on large carriages and not on a\r\nchaise.\r\n\r\nAbout fourteen years later the rage came in for four-in-hands. Ladies\r\nas well as men became marvellous charioteers. In fact, they used to\r\ndrive much faster than gentlemen, although we should not now think\r\ntheir speed very great, for people in the eighteenth century did not\r\nput their best horses into harness. Sir John Lade (the nephew of Mrs.\r\nThrale), Lord Rodney, and the Hon. Charles Finch were among the first\r\nto sport them. It was out of this fashion the modern Four-in-Hand Club\r\narose, in the early days of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nMail coaches from London to the large provincial towns began to run in\r\n1784. Their speed averaged about six miles an hour. By the end of the\r\neighteenth century the journey to Bath—ninety miles, now completed by\r\ntrain in a couple of hours at a cost of nine shillings—was accomplished\r\nin seventeen hours, the fare with meals being £4, 9s. 6d. Nineteen\r\nmail-coaches left every night at seven or half-past seven, passengers\r\npaying fourpence a mile. One of the largest hostelries of the\r\nMetropolis, the “George and Blue Boar,” in Holborn, sent out as many as\r\neighty and ninety coaches a day. As each one approached, or set out,\r\nfrom a stage, the guard blew a blast on his horn, and by the different\r\ncalls, the stable-boys knew what coach was coming, and which horses\r\nwould be wanted.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales (afterwards George IV.) encouraged dreadful\r\nextravagance in carriages. His favourite vehicle was in rose\r\ncolour. Another appearing in Hyde Park at that time was lined with\r\nlooking-glass, the horses were decorated with ribbons to match the\r\ncolour of the carriage, and everything was made as gorgeous as\r\npossible. During the season, which then lasted from December to the\r\nend of May, the Park was full of gay equipages, painted every colour\r\nof the rainbow, and their panels bore representations of allegories\r\nand mythological subjects. Every person of importance was attended\r\nby numerous flunkeys, the coachman was a very grand display, with a\r\nperiwig, a three-cornered hat laced with gold, and a capacious coat\r\nwith flounces and fur-trimmings to the cape, a costume which added to\r\nthat domestic’s vanity and assurance in no small degree, as he whipped\r\nup his four or six horses.\r\n\r\nThe phaeton with four horses superseded the curricle, and was\r\nconsidered the smart thing by Society.\r\n\r\nA remnant of these painted vehicles may be seen to-day in Sicily,\r\nand on sledges in Norway, otherwise decorations on the panels of\r\ncarriages have quite gone out of fashion. The Sicilian cart is still a\r\nmarvel, and often depicts such scenes as hell, with Satan burning in a\r\ncauldron, or a martyr flayed alive at the stake; Greek soldiers before\r\nTroy; a king on his throne with Templars standing near him; Æneas\r\nlanding in Sicily; the Virgin and Child; or scenes from the life of\r\nKing Roger.\r\n\r\nAs for the roads in England, their condition was still execrable.\r\nBefore macadam was introduced, nothing more was done towards repairing\r\nthe surface than setting down enormous stones to be crushed by passing\r\nwheels, but as they were not set close, the wheels went bumping into\r\nthe mud between, while the force of the jolt pushed the stones out of\r\nposition, and matters became worse and worse. The streets of London\r\nwere in such an ill-kept condition that people wanted their boots\r\ncleaned several times a day, and thus shoeblacks became an important\r\nfactor in London life.\r\n\r\nBefore the making of turnpike roads, waggons had been the usual means\r\nof conveyance, and “flying coaches,” as they were at first called, were\r\nconsidered a great improvement. However, fares were high, and even\r\nafter the introduction of public coaches many people who were not able\r\nto afford them still travelled by the slow-going waggon.\r\n\r\nHere is an account of such a journey from London to Greenwich:\r\n\r\n“We were twenty-four inside and nine without. It was my lot to sit in\r\nthe middle with a lusty woman on one side and thin man on the other.\r\n‘Open the windows,’ said the former, and she had a child on her lap\r\nwhose hands were besmeared with gingerbread. ‘It can’t be opened,’ said\r\na little prim coxcomb, ‘or I shall catch cold.’ ‘But I say it shall,\r\nsir,’ said a butcher who sat opposite, and the butcher opened it, but\r\nas he stood or rather bent forward to do this, the caravan came into\r\na rut, and the butcher’s head, by the suddenness of the jolt, came\r\ninto contact with that of the woman who sat next to me, and made her\r\nnose bleed. He begged her pardon, and she gave him a slap in the face\r\nthat sounded through the whole caravan. Two sailors that were seated\r\nnear the helm of the machine, ordered the driver to cast anchor at the\r\nnext public-house. He did so, and the woman next me called for a pint\r\nof ale, which she offered to me, after she had emptied about a half\r\nof it, observing, ‘that as how she loved ale mightily.’ I could not\r\ndrink, at which she took offence.... A violent dispute arose between\r\nthe two stout-looking men, the one a recruiting sergeant, the other\r\na gentleman’s coachman, about the Rights of Man. Another dispute\r\nafterwards was about politics, which was carried on with such warmth as\r\nto draw the attention of the company to the head of the caravan, where\r\nthe combatants sat wedged together like two pounds of Epping butter,\r\nwhilst a child constantly roared on the other side, and the mother\r\nabused the two politicians for frightening her babe. The heat was now\r\nso great that all the windows were opened, and with the fresh air\r\nentered clouds of dust, for the body of the machine is but a few inches\r\nfrom the surface of the road.”\r\n\r\nIf one can imagine this kind of thing continuing hour after hour, while\r\none’s bones ached with the cramp, and one was stupefied with the noise\r\nand smell, one gains some idea of the delights of waggon travelling.\r\n\r\nThe increase in driving led to great improvement in the roads. Even the\r\n“bagmen” of the country, whom we call commercial travellers, renounced\r\ntheir bags and adopted the gig, which was soon introduced into Hyde\r\nPark in a glorified form.\r\n\r\nToll-gates were instituted on every main road between towns to\r\ntax passers-by for the upkeep of the roads, and these increased\r\ntremendously in the early nineteenth century. So much so, that they led\r\nin 1843 to that strange series of riots, known as the “Rebecca Riots,”\r\nbecause the rioters took the scriptural words, “And they blessed\r\nRebekah and said, ... let thy seed possess the gate of them which hate\r\nthem,” as their motto. Men, dressed as women, attacked the gates.\r\n\r\nThese barriers were originally formed with a cross of two bars, armed\r\nat the end with pikes, _turning on a pin_, and fixed to prevent the\r\npassage of horses, hence their name. On many of the old highways\r\nthroughout England a projecting house still shows where a turnpike\r\ngate stood, and over the door are the marks of the board on which the\r\nscale of charges was written. The twenty-seven London toll-bars were\r\nabolished in 1864, but it was not until 1889 that they disappeared in\r\nthe country districts of England. What a blessing to motorists that\r\nthey are gone.\r\n\r\nLittle more than half a century ago railroads drove the coaches off the\r\nhighways. Only within the last decade or so the conditions of London\r\nstreet traffic have been entirely revolutionised. But what we take to\r\nbe new is in a large measure old. The steam omnibus, which is quite\r\nthe latest thing of to-day (1908), is really a direct descendant of\r\nthe steam coaches introduced in the time of George IV. Many efforts\r\nwere made to utilise steam motors between the years 1821 and 1833. The\r\n“Enterprise,” which ran from Paddington to the City in the latter year,\r\nwas remarkably like the last type just placed on the streets. Most of\r\nthese were private ventures, but in spite of a Select Committee being\r\nappointed, and their verdict being, on the whole, favourable, it has\r\npractically taken the entire nineteenth century to educate people up to\r\nthis mode of transit.\r\n\r\nTen years after the Commission sat, other public steam carriages were\r\nattempted. One of them made the journey to Windsor, and was inspected\r\nby Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, who were highly pleased with it.\r\nThe motor had attained a speed of eighteen to twenty miles an hour. But\r\nit was still before its day.\r\n\r\nThe horse-drawn omnibus is older than most people think. Soon it will\r\nhave reached the eightieth anniversary of its advent. The first real\r\nLondon omnibus was run from the “Yorkshire Stingo” (near the present\r\nGreat Central Hotel), Paddington, to the Bank in 1829, and was found\r\nso convenient that in two years ninety vehicles of the kind were in\r\npublic service. At first the driver used to collect fares; but as\r\ncompetition increased, the drivers raced on their routes (as they do\r\nat the present day), and the conductors—or “cads,” as they were then\r\ncalled—practically fought to secure passengers, especially if the\r\npassenger was an unprotected female of the Early Victorian days. The\r\n“knife board” of the eighties, and the narrow, horizontal footrests\r\nwhich made the top of the ’bus an impossible altitude for women to\r\nattain, has become as extinct as the dodo, since garden seats and\r\nstaircases to the top have popularised the vehicle for both sexes.\r\n\r\nIf I may be allowed a digression, may I say that, in 1900 and 1904,\r\nwhen I was in up-to-date New York, omnibuses of the oldest possible\r\ntype, with seats behind the driver almost as difficult to climb as a\r\nchimney-stack from the street, were still running from Maddison Square\r\nup Fifth Avenue past Central Park. I well remember admiring the Dewey\r\nArch at the top of Broadway, erected after the Admiral’s victories in\r\nthe Philippines, and then being persuaded to see the charms of Central\r\nPark from the top of a ’bus—“if you have the pluck to climb up,” said\r\nmy friend.\r\n\r\nPluck! Fancy anyone using such a word to an Englishwoman. Why, of\r\ncourse I had.\r\n\r\nWe waited. The ’bus came. There, at one of the busiest points of that\r\nbusy city’s streets, the vehicle drew up. There was no stairway, no\r\nladder even as to a coach. I simply had to clamber from axle to wheel,\r\nfrom wheel to small step below the driver, and—dragged and hauled by\r\nthat kindly person—land somehow into a seat beside him,—then to step\r\nover that into a row of seats placed still higher behind the driver’s\r\nback. I had split my sleeve and made a pair of white kid gloves filthy\r\nin the process, but I was there! No wonder American women do not aspire\r\nto the tops of omnibuses, and no wonder that the bustling crowd stopped\r\nto look at a mad Englishwoman in her best frock attempting athletic\r\nfeats. Even the fat Irish policeman, white bâton in hand, looked on\r\nand marvelled. Up-to-date as the Americans boast to be, it was curious\r\nto find such an obsolete old vehicle still doing duty in the heart of\r\ntheir metropolis. Many of the roads in important towns in America are\r\nto-day little better than those of London a century and a half ago.\r\n\r\nAnother great change in locomotion in London came with the trams, which\r\nare more recent than ’buses; but the horse-drawn tram has already\r\ndisappeared and given place to electricity, while the tubes are\r\naccustoming us to take our short journeys underground.\r\n\r\nNothing is so typical of the London streets as the light, swift-moving\r\nhansom cab. Its extraordinary abundance everywhere is one of the first\r\nthings that impresses the intelligent foreigner within this capital\r\nof ours. Joseph Hansom took out his patent so long ago as 1834. His\r\nwas not, it is true, the present-day vehicle, which has been evolved\r\nout of all recognition from its original conception, though it still\r\nimmortalises his name. The cab itself was the outcome of the gig.\r\n\r\nCabriolets, or gigs with hoods, were introduced into London in 1762,\r\nbut it was not until 1805 that they were established as public\r\nvehicles. Then eight received licences. They were two-wheeled,\r\nsomething like a modern hansom. The fare sat by the side of the driver;\r\nbut under the hood. Only twelve were at first allowed to ply for hire,\r\nand these stood in Portland Street. They attained great popularity, and\r\ndisplaced the hackney coach, which by this time had grown into a heavy\r\ntwo-horsed vehicle.\r\n\r\nThat advent of the hansom is being repeated to-day in the placing of\r\ntaximeter motor cabs on the streets. No one is so conservative as the\r\nLondon cabby, and the “new-fangled” vehicles, which were at the outset\r\nthe object of so much chaff—not too good-humoured—had to live down\r\nopposition, but from the first little group placed at Hyde Park Corner\r\nat Easter, 1906, they grew so rapidly in popularity that in a short\r\ntime thousands were plying our streets for hire. The smart-liveried\r\nyoung chauffeur of the “taxi” is a strong contrast to the picturesque\r\nbut decidedly gruff and untidy old driver, who for so long has figured\r\nconspicuously among the motley types of London.\r\n\r\nA larger cab than the hansom, built like a brougham, came into use\r\nin 1836, and from that the familiar four-wheeled “growler” has\r\ndeveloped,* *—backwards to a more remote ancestor, as some curious\r\nstudent of evolution might surmise.\r\n\r\nBicycles rapidly evolved from the old “bone-shaker,” with wooden wheels\r\nand iron rims, through the high-wheeled “ordinary,” with solid rubber\r\ntyres, to the present “safety” type. The “bone-shaker” was itself an\r\noffspring of the earlier “hobby-horse” on wheels, awkwardly propelled\r\nby the rider’s feet touching the ground. This was almost a peculiarity\r\nof Hyde Park, where the young beaux of the middle-nineteenth century\r\ndisported themselves on the bone-racking contrivance, for few ventured\r\nout into the streets or to the open country upon it.\r\n\r\nOnly the invention of the low-bent frame made cycling for women\r\npossible about 1892. I remember gazing one day out of an hotel window\r\nin Copenhagen, when to my surprise I saw a woman riding on a bicycle.\r\nIt must be remembered that pneumatic tyres had only a short time before\r\nthat been invented.\r\n\r\n“Look!” I called to my husband. “Surely that is a woman cycling!”\r\n\r\n“Why, so it is, and how nice she looks,” he replied, and as he spoke\r\nanother woman similarly engaged came into view. We soon put on our\r\nhats, and wandered off to watch the ladies of Copenhagen indulging in\r\nsuch a novel pastime. I quickly decided that as soon as I returned to\r\nLondon I would try, too. I did, in the dusk round the Regent’s Park,\r\nstared at and jeered at by the little boys, who found great fun in a\r\nwoman’s first futile endeavours to mount.\r\n\r\nParis quickly followed Denmark’s lead, and England came along slowly\r\nbehind. Every man, woman, and child rides a bicycle nowadays. On\r\ntheir first appearance, and for many years afterwards, bicycles were\r\nnot allowed in the parks, but gradually it was found impossible to\r\nkeep them out, and in 1904 an order was issued allowing them to be\r\nridden anywhere in Hyde Park except at the busiest hours. Even that\r\nrestriction was shortly afterwards withdrawn, and one cycled among\r\nthousands of riders passing in a constant stream between the Achilles\r\nstatue and along the banks of the Serpentine to the Magazine.\r\n\r\nThe cycle craze, however, as a means of town amusement for the\r\nfashionable world, has already died out. In Hyde Park it had but a\r\nshort life. One year everyone flocked to Battersea Park, where in\r\ncertain hours of the day the cycling throng mustered in battalions, and\r\nmost of them were smart young Englishwomen. But nowadays the cyclists\r\nseen in the Park are not those who come out to while away an hour or\r\ntwo, but mostly riders taking a short cut to distant parts of London or\r\nto the country.\r\n\r\nThe evolution of the twentieth-century girl began with the “bike” at\r\nthe end of the previous decade, and is taking root in the suffragette.\r\n\r\nThe motor seems to be the last word in locomotion, and until the flying\r\nmachine is more firmly established to enable us poor groundlings to\r\ncourse through the air, it is difficult to foresee what is going\r\nto displace it. The first efforts of motoring were not altogether\r\nhappy. So terrible had the smell and the noise of the petrol cars\r\nbecome, that in 1906 an order was issued that none but electrically\r\ndriven vehicles were to pass through the Park between the hours of\r\nfour and seven. Then those delightfully silent electric landaulettes\r\nplied in and out of the horsed traffic, almost unperceived, and the\r\nobjectionable fumes disappeared.\r\n\r\nFrequently the King’s car is to be seen in Hyde Park. One day, a year\r\nor two ago, his Majesty’s motor came to a sudden stop in Richmond Park,\r\nand a crowd which promptly assembled enjoyed the agreeable spectacle\r\nof the King instructing his chauffeur how to deal with a breakdown,\r\nand showing in a number of ways his intimate knowledge of motor-car\r\nmechanism.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty’s immunity from accident is owing as much to his own\r\ndiscretion in driving as to the abilities of his chauffeurs. His car\r\nseldom exceeds the twenty miles an hour limit, although he is subject\r\nto no speed regulations. His explicit instructions are that a moderate\r\npace must be observed in passing towns or villages.\r\n\r\nIn these pages we have seen that the history and romance of Hyde Park\r\ndates from the time of the Roman encampment near the rude settlement of\r\nthe Trinobantes, which the invaders called Londinium.\r\n\r\nThat Tyburn, probably the most tragic, if not the most historical,\r\nspot in all England, stood in the vicinity where the Marble Arch now\r\nstands. That the first hanging took place there in 1196, and executions\r\ncontinued until 1783. Every offence, from stealing a yard of ribbon\r\nto murder, heresy, and treason, paid its penalty at Tyburn, and the\r\nperpetrator was hanged, drawn, and quartered at the gallows.\r\n\r\nHyde Park has been a Royal Forest, the happy fishing ground of monks,\r\nfrom whose hands it passed at the Dissolution of the Monasteries. A\r\nclosely preserved Royal Park, the scene of vile tragedies, a famous\r\nracecourse (the precursor of Newmarket), the training-ground of\r\nCromwellian troops; and it was even sold by auction. The playground\r\nof Society, a refuge from the plague, the scene of public rejoicings,\r\nand the Great Exhibition of 1851. The safety-valve of individuals with\r\ngrievances, the most remarkable, perhaps, of latter days being the\r\nrevolution of the suffragettes in 1907.\r\n\r\nAnd Hyde Park still remains the great social open-air centre of London,\r\nwhere the gay world desports itself as it has done through many\r\ncenturies. That great green sward has been the high-ground of history\r\nand romance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYDE PARK AND KENSINGTON GARDENS\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF TREES AND SHRUBS THAT HAVE BEEN PLANTED\r\n\r\nKINDLY SUPPLIED FOR THIS VOLUME BY MAJOR HUSSEY, OF HIS MAJESTY’S\r\nOFFICE OF WORKS\r\n\r\nH. means Hyde Park; K. means Kensington Gardens; H.
