D. is primarily intended to\r\nmeet the needs of introductory college courses in Roman History. However,\r\nit is hoped that it may also prove of service as a handbook for students\r\nof Roman life and literature in general. It is with the latter in mind\r\nthat I have added the bibliographical note. Naturally, within the brief\r\nlimits of such a text, it was impossible to defend the point of view\r\nadopted on disputed points or to take notice of divergent opinions.\r\nTherefore, to show the great debt which I owe to the work of others, and\r\nto provide those interested in particular problems with some guide to more\r\ndetailed study, I have given a list of selected references, which express,\r\nI believe, the prevailing views of modern scholarship upon the various\r\nphases of Roman History.\r\n\r\nI wish to acknowledge my general indebtedness to Professor W. S. Ferguson\r\nof Harvard University for his guidance in my approach to the study of\r\nRoman History, and also my particular obligations to Professor W. L.\r\nWestermann of Cornell, and to my colleagues, Professors A. L. Cross and J.\r\nG. Winter, for reading portions of my manuscript and for much helpful\r\ncriticism.\r\n\r\n                                                            A. E. R.

These differences are mainly due to differences of opinion among\r\nmoderns as to the credibility of the ancient accounts of this period. And\r\nso it will perhaps prove helpful to give a brief review of these sources,\r\nand to indicate the estimate of their value which is reflected in this\r\nbook.\r\n\r\nThe earliest Roman historical records were in the form of annals, that is,\r\nbrief notices of important events in connection with the names of the\r\nconsuls or other eponymous officials for each year. They may be compared\r\nto the early monastic chronicles of the Middle Ages. Writing was practised\r\nin Rome as early as the sixth century B. C. and there can be no doubt that\r\nthe names of consuls or their substitutes were recorded from the early\r\nyears of the republic, although the form of the record is unknown. It is\r\nin the annals that the oldest list of the consuls was preserved, the\r\nCapitoline consular and triumphal Fasti or lists being reconstructions of\r\nthe time of Augustus.\r\n\r\nThe authorship of the earliest annals is not recorded. However, at the\r\nopening of the second century B. C. the Roman pontiffs had in their\r\ncustody annals which purported to run back to the foundation of the city,\r\nincluding the regal period. We know also that as late as the time of the\r\nGracchi it was customary for the Pontifex Maximus to record on a tablet\r\nfor public inspection the chief events of each year. When this custom\r\nbegan is uncertain and it can only be proven for the time when the Romans\r\nhad commenced to undertake maritime wars. From these pontifical records\r\nwere compiled the so-called _annales Maximi_, or chief annals, whose name\r\npermits the belief that briefer compilations were also in existence. There\r\nwere likewise commentaries preserved in the priestly colleges, which\r\ncontained ritualistic formulæ, as well as attempted explanations of the\r\norigins of usages and ceremonies.\r\n\r\nApart from these annals and commentaries there existed but little\r\nhistorical material before the close of the third century B. C. There was\r\nno Roman literature; no trace remains of any narrative poetry, nor of\r\nfamily chronicles. Brief funerary inscriptions, like that of Scipio\r\nBarbatus, appear in the course of the third century, and laudatory funeral\r\norations giving the records of family achievements seem to have come into\r\nvogue about the end of the same century.\r\n\r\nHowever, the knowledge of writing made possible the inscription upon stone\r\nor other material of public documents which required to be preserved with\r\nexactness. Thus laws and treaties were committed to writing. But the\r\nRomans, unlike the Greeks, paid little attention to the careful\r\npreservation of other documents and, until a late date, did not even keep\r\na record of the minor magistrates. Votive offerings and other dedications\r\nwere also inscribed, but as with the laws and treaties, few of these\r\nsurvived into the days of historical writing, owing to neglect and the\r\ndestruction wrought in the city by the Gauls in 387 B. C.\r\n\r\nNor had the Greeks paid much attention to Roman history prior to the war\r\nwith Pyrrhus in 281 B. C., although from that time onwards Greek\r\nhistorians devoted themselves to the study of Roman affairs. From this\r\ndate the course of Roman history is fairly clear. However, as early as the\r\nopening of the fourth century B. C. the Greeks had sought to bring the\r\nRomans into relation with other civilized peoples of the ancient world by\r\nascribing the foundation of Rome to Aeneas and the exiles from Troy; a\r\ntale which had gained acceptance in Rome by the close of the third\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThe first step in Roman historical writing was taken at the close of the\r\nSecond Punic War by Quintus Fabius Pictor, who wrote in Greek a history of\r\nRome from its foundation to his own times. A similar work, also in Greek,\r\nwas composed by his contemporary, Lucius Cincius Alimentus. The oldest\r\ntraditions were thus wrought into a connected version, which has been\r\npreserved in some passages of Polybius, but to a larger extent in the\r\nfragments of the _Library of Universal History_ compiled by Diodorus the\r\nSicilian about 30 B. C. Existing portions of his work (books 11 to 20)\r\ncover the period from 480 to 302 B. C.; and as his library is little more\r\nthan a series of excerpts his selections dealing with Roman history\r\nreflect his sources with little contamination.\r\n\r\nOther Roman chroniclers of the second century B. C. also wrote in Greek\r\nand, although early in that century Ennius wrote his epic relating the\r\nstory of Rome from the settlement of Aeneas, it was not until about 168\r\nthat the first historical work in Latin prose appeared. This was the\r\n_Origins_ of Marcus Porcius Cato, which contained an account of the\r\nmythical origins of Rome and other Italian cities, and was subsequently\r\nexpanded to cover the period from the opening of the Punic Wars to 149\r\nB. C.\r\n\r\nContemporary history soon attracted the attention of the Romans but they\r\ndid not neglect the earlier period. In their treatment of the latter new\r\ntendencies appear about the time of Sulla under patriotic and rhetorical\r\nstimuli. The aim of historians now became to provide the public with an\r\naccount of the early days of Rome that would be commeasurate with her\r\nlater greatness, and to adorn this narrative, in Greek fashion, with\r\nanecdotes, speeches, and detailed descriptions, which would enliven their\r\npages and fascinate their readers. Their material they obtained by\r\ninvention, by falsification, and by the incorporation into Roman history\r\nof incidents from the history of other peoples. These writers were not\r\nstrictly historians, but writers of historical romance. Their chief\r\nrepresentative was Valerius Antias.\r\n\r\nThe Ciceronian age saw great vigor displayed in antiquarian research, with\r\nthe object of explaining the origin of ancient Roman customs, ceremonies,\r\ninstitutions, monuments, and legal formulæ, and of establishing early\r\nRoman chronology. In this field the greatest activity was shown by Marcus\r\nTerentius Varro, whose _Antiquities_ deeply influenced his contemporaries\r\nand successors.\r\n\r\nIn the age of Augustus, between 27 B. C. and 19 A. D., Livy wrote his\r\ngreat history of Rome from its beginnings. His work summed up the efforts\r\nof his predecessors and gave to the history of Rome down to his own times\r\nthe form which it preserved for the rest of antiquity. Although it is\r\nlacking in critical acumen in the handling of sources, and in an\r\nunderstanding for political and military history, the dramatic and\r\nliterary qualities of his work have ensured its popularity. Of it there\r\nhave been preserved the first ten books (to 293 B. C.), and books 21 to 45\r\n(from 218 to 167 B. C.). A contemporary of Livy was the Greek writer\r\nDionysius of Halicarnassus, who wrote a work called _Roman Antiquities_,\r\nwhich covered the history of Rome down to 265 B. C. The earlier part of\r\nhis work has also been preserved. In general he depended upon Varro and\r\nLivy, and gives substantially the same view of early Roman history as the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\nWhat these later writers added to the meagre annalistic narrative\r\npreserved in Diodorus is of little historical value, except in so far as\r\nit shows what the Romans came to believe with regard to their own past.\r\nThe problem which faced the later Roman historians was the one which faces\r\nwriters of Roman history today, namely, to explain the origins and early\r\ndevelopment of the Roman state. And their explanation does not deserve\r\nmore credence than a modern reconstruction simply because they were nearer\r\nin point of time to the period in question, for they had no wealth of\r\nhistorical materials which have since been lost, and they were not\r\nanimated by a desire to reach the truth at all costs nor guided by\r\nrational principles of historical criticism. Accordingly we must regard as\r\nmythical the traditional narrative of the founding of Rome and of the\r\nregal period, and for the history of the republic to the time of the war\r\nwith Pyrrhus we should rely upon the list of eponymous magistrates, whose\r\nvariations indicate political crises, supplemented by the account in\r\nDiodorus, with the admission that this itself is not infallible. All that\r\nsupplements or deviates from this we should frankly acknowledge to be of a\r\nhypothetical nature. Therefore we should concede the impossibility of\r\ngiving a complete and adequate account of the history of these centuries\r\nand refrain from doing ourselves what we criticize in the Roman\r\nhistorians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  PART I\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE FORERUNNERS OF ROME IN ITALY\r\n\r\n\r\n                      A HISTORY OF ROME TO 565 A. D.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE GEOGRAPHY OF ITALY\r\n\r\n\r\nItaly, ribbed by the Apennines, girdled by the Alps and the sea, juts out\r\nlike a “long pier-head” from Europe towards the northern coast of Africa.\r\nIt includes two regions of widely differing physical characteristics: the\r\nnorthern, continental; the southern, peninsular. The peninsula is slightly\r\nlarger than the continental portion: together their area is about 91,200\r\nsquare miles.\r\n\r\n*Continental Italy.* The continental portion of Italy consists of the\r\nsouthern watershed of the Alps and the northern watershed of the\r\nApennines, with the intervening lowland plain, drained, for the most part,\r\nby the river Po and its numerous tributaries. On the north, the Alps\r\nextend in an irregular crescent of over 1200 miles from the Mediterranean\r\nto the Adriatic. They rise abruptly on the Italian side, but their\r\nnorthern slope is gradual, with easy passes leading over the divide to the\r\nsouthern plain. Thus they invite rather than deter immigration from\r\ncentral Europe. East and west continental Italy measures around 320 miles;\r\nits width from north to south does not exceed seventy miles.\r\n\r\n*The peninsula.* The southern portion of Italy consists of a long, narrow\r\npeninsula, running northwest and southeast between the Mediterranean and\r\nAdriatic seas, and terminating in two promontories, which form the toe and\r\nheel of the “Italian boot.” The length of the peninsula is 650 miles; its\r\nbreadth is nowhere more than 125 miles. In striking contrast to the plains\r\nof the Po, southern Italy is traversed throughout by the parallel ridges\r\nof the Apennines, which give it an endless diversity of hill and valley.\r\nThe average height of these mountains, which form a sort of vertebrate\r\nsystem for the peninsula (_Apennino dorso Italia dividitur_, Livy xxxvi,\r\n15), is about 4,000 feet, and even their highest peaks (9,500 feet) are\r\nbelow the line of perpetual snow. The Apennine chain is highest on its\r\neastern side where it approaches closely to the Adriatic, leaving only a\r\nnarrow strip of coast land, intersected by numerous short mountain\r\ntorrents. On the west the mountains are lower and recede further from the\r\nsea, leaving the wide lowland areas of Etruria, Latium and Campania. On\r\nthis side, too, are rivers of considerable length, navigable for small\r\ncraft; the Volturnus and Liris, the Tiber and the Arno, whose valleys link\r\nthe coast with the highlands of the interior.\r\n\r\n*The **coast-line**.* In comparison with Greece, Italy presents a striking\r\nregularity of coast-line. Throughout its length of over 2000 miles it has\r\nremarkably few deep bays or good harbors, and these few are almost all on\r\nthe southern and western shores. Thus the character of the Mediterranean\r\ncoast of Italy, with its fertile lowlands, its rivers, its harbors, and\r\nits general southerly aspect, rendered it more inviting and accessible to\r\napproach from the sea than the eastern coast, and determined its\r\nleadership in the cultural and material advancement of the peninsula.\r\n\r\n*Climate.* The climate of Italy as a whole, like that of other\r\nMediterranean lands, is characterized by a high average temperature, and\r\nan absence of extremes of heat or cold. Nevertheless, it varies greatly in\r\ndifferent localities, according to their northern or southern situation,\r\ntheir elevation, and their proximity to the sea. In the Po valley there is\r\na close approach to the continental climate of central Europe, with a\r\nmarked difference between summer and winter temperatures and clearly\r\nmarked transitional periods of spring and autumn. On the other hand, in\r\nthe south of the peninsula the climate becomes more tropical, with its\r\nperiods of winter rain and summer drought, and a rapid transition between\r\nthe moist and the dry seasons.\r\n\r\n*Malaria.* Both in antiquity and in modern times the disease from which\r\nItaly has suffered most has been the dreaded malaria. The explanation is\r\nto be found in the presence of extensive marshy areas in the river valleys\r\nand along the coast. The ravages of this disease have varied according as\r\nthe progress of civilization has brought about the cultivation and\r\ndrainage of the affected areas or its decline has wrought the undoing of\r\nthis beneficial work.\r\n\r\n*Forests.* In striking contrast to their present baldness, the slopes of\r\nthe Apennines were once heavily wooded, and the well-tilled fields of the\r\nPo valley were also covered with tall forests. Timber for houses and ships\r\nwas to be had in abundance, and as late as the time of Augustus Italy was\r\nheld to be a well-forested country.\r\n\r\n*Minerals.* The mineral wealth of Italy has never been very great at any\r\ntime. In antiquity the most important deposits were the iron ores of the\r\nisland of Elba, and the copper mines of Etruria and Liguria. For a time,\r\nthe gold washings in the valleys of the Graian Alps were worked with\r\nprofit.\r\n\r\n*Agriculture.* The true wealth of Italy lay in the richness of her soil,\r\nwhich generously repaid the labor of agriculturist or horticulturist. The\r\nlowland areas yielded large crops of grain of all sorts—millet, maize,\r\nwheat, oats and barley—while legumes were raised in abundance everywhere.\r\nCampania was especially fertile and is reported to have yielded three\r\nsuccessive crops annually. The vine and the olive flourished, and their\r\ncultivation eventually became even more profitable than the raising of\r\ngrain.\r\n\r\nThe valleys and mountain sides afforded excellent pasturage at all\r\nseasons, and the raising of cattle and sheep ranked next in importance to\r\nagricultural pursuits among the country’s industries.\r\n\r\n*The **islands**: Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica.* The geographical location of\r\nthe three large islands, Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica, links their history\r\nclosely with that of the Italian peninsula. The large triangle of Sicily\r\n(11,290 sq. mi.) is separated from the southwest extremity of Italy by the\r\nnarrow straits of Rhegium, and lies like a stepping-stone between Europe\r\nand Africa. Its situation, and the richness of its soil, which caused it\r\nto become one of the granaries of Rome, made it of far greater historical\r\nimportance than the other two islands. Sardinia (9,400 sq. mi.) and\r\nCorsica (3,376 sq. mi.), owing to their rugged, mountainous character and\r\ntheir greater remoteness from the coast of Italy, have been always, from\r\nboth the economic and the cultural standpoint, far behind the more favored\r\nSicily.\r\n\r\n*The historical significance of Italy’s configuration and location.* The\r\nconfiguration of the Italian peninsula, long, narrow, and traversed by\r\nmountain ridges, hindered rather than helped its political unification.\r\nYet the Apennine chain, running parallel to the length of the peninsula,\r\noffered no such serious barriers to that unification as did the network of\r\nmountains and the long inlets that intersect the peninsula of Greece. And\r\nwhen once Italy had been welded into a single state by the power of Rome,\r\nits central position greatly facilitated the extension of the Roman\r\ndominion over the whole Mediterranean basin.\r\n\r\n*The name Italia.* The name Italy is the ancient _Italia_, derived from\r\nthe people known as the _Itali_, whose name had its origin in the word\r\n_vitulus_ (calf). It was applied by the Greeks as early as the fifth\r\ncentury B. C. to the southwestern extremity of the peninsula, adjacent to\r\nthe island of Sicily. It rapidly acquired a much wider significance,\r\nuntil, from the opening of the second century, _Italia_ in a geographical\r\nsense denoted the whole country as far north as the Alps. Politically, as\r\nwe shall see, the name for a long time had a much more restricted\r\nsignificance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\n                    PREHISTORIC CIVILIZATION IN ITALY\r\n\r\n\r\n*Accessibility of Italy to external influences.* The long coast-line of\r\nthe Italian peninsula rendered it peculiarly accessible to influences from\r\noverseas, for the sea united rather than divided the peoples of antiquity.\r\nThus Italy was constantly subjected to immigration by sea, and much more\r\nso to cultural stimuli from the lands whose shores bordered the same seas\r\nas her own. Nor did the Alps and the forests and swamps of the Po valley\r\noppose any effectual barrier to migrations and cultural influences from\r\ncentral Europe. Consequently we have in Italy the meeting ground of\r\npeoples coming by sea from east and south and coming over land from the\r\nnorth, each bringing a new racial, linguistic, and cultural element to\r\nenrich the life of the peninsula. These movements had been going on since\r\nremote antiquity, until, at the beginning of the period of recorded\r\nhistory, Italy was occupied by peoples of different races, speaking\r\ndifferent languages, and living under widely different political and\r\ncultural conditions.\r\n\r\nAs yet many problems connected with the origin and migrations of the\r\nhistoric peoples of Italy remain unsolved; but the sciences of archaeology\r\nand philology have done much toward enabling us to present a reasonably\r\nclear and connected picture of the development of civilization and the\r\nmovements of these peoples in prehistoric times.\r\n\r\n*The Old Stone Age.* From all over Italy come proofs of the presence of\r\nman in the earliest stage of human development—the Paleolithic or Old\r\nStone Age. The chipped flint instruments of this epoch have been found in\r\nconsiderable abundance, and are chiefly of the Moustérien and Chelléen\r\ntypes. With these have been unearthed the bones of the cave bear, cave\r\nlion, cave hyena, giant stag, and early types of the rhinoceros,\r\nhippopotamus, and elephant, which Paleolithic man fought and hunted. In\r\nthe Balzi Rossi caves, near Ventimiglia in Liguria, there have been found\r\nhuman skeletons, some of which, at least, are agreed to be of the\r\nPaleolithic Age. But the caves in Liguria and elsewhere, then the only\r\nhabitations which men knew, do not reveal the lifelike and vigorous mural\r\ndrawings and carvings on bone, which the Old Stone Age has left in the\r\ncaves of France and Spain.\r\n\r\n*The New Stone Age.* With the Neolithic or New Stone Age there appears in\r\nItaly a civilization characterized by the use of instruments of polished\r\nstone. Axes, adzes, and chisels, of various shapes and sizes, as well as\r\nother utensils, were shaped by polishing and grinding from sandstone,\r\nlimestone, jade, nephrite, diorite, and other stones. Along with these,\r\nhowever, articles of chipped flint and obsidian, for which the workshops\r\nhave been found, and also instruments of bone, were in common use. The\r\nNeolithic people were also acquainted with the art of making pottery, an\r\nart unknown to the Paleolithic Age.\r\n\r\nLike the men of the preceding epoch, those of the Neolithic Age readily\r\ntook up their abode in natural caves. However, they also built for\r\nthemselves villages of circular huts of wicker-work and clay, at times\r\nerected over pits excavated in the ground. Such village sites, the\r\nso-called _fonde di capanne_, are widely distributed throughout Italy.\r\n\r\nThey buried their dead in caves, or in pits dug in the ground, sometimes\r\nlining the pit with stones. The corpse was regularly placed in a\r\ncontracted position, accompanied by weapons, vases, clothing, and food.\r\nSecond burials and the practice of coloring the bones of the skeletons\r\nwith red pigment were in vogue.\r\n\r\n*Climatic change.* The climate of Italy had changed considerably from that\r\nof the preceding age, and a new fauna had appeared. In place of the\r\nprimitive elephant and his associates, Neolithic men hunted the stag,\r\nbeaver, bear, fox, wolf and wild boar. Remains of such domestic animals as\r\nthe ox, horse, sheep, goat, pig, dog, and ass, show that they were a\r\npastoral although not an agricultural people.\r\n\r\n*A new racial element.* The use of polished stone weapons, the manufacture\r\nof pottery, the hut villages and a uniform system of burial rites\r\ndistinguished the Neolithic from the Paleolithic civilization. And,\r\nbecause of these differences, especially because of the introduction of\r\nthis system of burial which argues a distinctive set of religious beliefs,\r\nin addition to the fact that the development of this civilization from\r\nthat which preceded cannot be traced on Italian soil, it is held with\r\nreason that at the opening of the Neolithic Age a new race entered Italy,\r\nbringing with it the Neolithic culture. Here and there men of the former\r\nage may have survived and copied the arts of the newcomers, but throughout\r\nthe whole peninsula the racial unity of the population is shown by the\r\nuniformity of their burial customs. The inhabitants of Sicily and Sardinia\r\nin this age had a civilization of the same type as that on the mainland.\r\n\r\n*The Ligurians probably a Neolithic people.* It is highly probable that\r\none of the historic peoples of Italy was a direct survival from the\r\nNeolithic period. This was the people called the Ligures (Ligurians), who\r\nto a late date maintained themselves in the mountainous district around\r\nthe Gulf of Genoa. In support of this view it may be urged (1) that\r\ntradition regarded them as one of the oldest peoples of Italy, (2) that\r\neven when Rome was the dominant state in Italy they occupied the whole\r\nwestern portion of the Po valley and extended southward almost to Pisa,\r\nwhile they were believed to have held at one time a much wider territory,\r\n(3) that at the opening of our own era they were still in a comparatively\r\nbarbarous state, living in caves and rude huts, and (4) that the Neolithic\r\nculture survived longest in this region, which was unaffected by the\r\nmigrations of subsequent ages.\r\n\r\n*The Aeneolithic Age.* The introduction of the use of copper marks the\r\ntransition from the Neolithic period to that called the Aeneolithic, or\r\nStone and Copper Age. This itself is but a prelude to the true Bronze Age.\r\nApparently copper first found its way into Italy along the trade routes\r\nfrom the Danube valley and from the eastern Mediterranean, while the local\r\ndeposits were as yet unworked. In other respects there is no great\r\ndifference between the Neolithic civilization and the Aeneolithic, and\r\nthere is no evidence to place the entrance of a new race into Italy at\r\nthis time.\r\n\r\n*The Bronze Age.* The Bronze Age proper in Italy is marked by the\r\nappearance of a new type of civilization—that of the builders of the pile\r\nvillages. There are two distinct forms of pile village. The one, called\r\n_palafitte_, is a true lake village, raised on a pile structure above the\r\nwaters of the surrounding lake or marsh. The other, called _terramare_, is\r\na pile village constructed on solid ground and surrounded by an artificial\r\nmoat.\r\n\r\n*The palafitte.* The traces of the _palafitte_ are fairly closely confined\r\nto the Alpine lake region of Italy from Lake Maggiore to Lake Garda. In\r\ngeneral, these lake villages date from an early stage of Bronze Age\r\nculture, for later on, in most cases, their inhabitants seem to have\r\nabandoned them for sites on dry land further to the south. The\r\nlake-dwellers were hunters and herdsmen, but they practised agriculture as\r\nwell, raising corn and millet. In addition to their bronze implements,\r\nthey continued to use those of more primitive materials—bone and stone.\r\nThey, too, manufactured a characteristic sort of pottery, of rather rude\r\nworkmanship, which differs strikingly from that of the Neolithic Age. In\r\nthe late Bronze Age, at any rate, they cremated their dead and buried the\r\nashes in funerary urns. For their earlier practice evidence is lacking.\r\n\r\n*The terramare.* The _terramare_ settlements are found chiefly in the Po\r\nvalley; to the north of that river around Mantua, and to the south between\r\nPiacenza and Bologna. Scattered villages have been found throughout the\r\npeninsula; one as far south as Taranto. The _terramare_ village was\r\nregularly constructed in the form of a trapezoid, with a north and south\r\norientation. It was surrounded by an earthen wall, around the base of\r\nwhich ran a wide moat, supplied with running water from a neighboring\r\nstream. Access to the settlement was had by a single wooden bridge, easy\r\nto destroy in time of danger. The space within the wall was divided in the\r\ncenter by a main road running north and south the whole length of the\r\nsettlement. It was paralleled by some narrower roads and intersected at\r\nright angles by others. On one side of this main highway was a space\r\nsurrounded by an inner moat, crossed by a bridge. This area was\r\nuninhabited and probably devoted to religious purposes. The dwellings were\r\nbuilt on pile foundations along the roadways. Outside the moat was placed\r\nthe cemetery. The dead were cremated and the ashes deposited in ossuary\r\nurns, which were laid side by side in the burial places. The remains were\r\nrarely accompanied by anything but some smaller vases placed in the\r\nossuary.\r\n\r\n*The terramare civilization.* With the _terramare_ people bronze had\r\nalmost completely supplanted stone instruments. Bronze daggers, swords,\r\naxes, arrowheads, spearheads, razors, and pins have been preserved in\r\nabundance. However, articles of bone and of horn were also in general use.\r\nThe _terramare_ civilization had likewise its special type of hand-made\r\npottery of peculiar shapes and ornamentation. A characteristic form of\r\nornamentation was the crescent-shaped handle (_ansa lunata_). The\r\n_terramare_ peoples were both agricultural and pastoral, cultivating wheat\r\nand flax and raising the better known domestic animals; while they also\r\nhunted the stag and the wild boar.\r\n\r\n*The peoples of the palafitte and the terramare.* Owing to their custom of\r\ndwelling in pile villages, their practice of cremating their dead, and\r\nother characteristics peculiar to their type of civilization, the peoples\r\nof the _palafitte_ and the _terramare_ are believed to have introduced a\r\nnew racial element into Italy. The former probably descended from the\r\nSwiss lake region, while the latter probably came from the valley of the\r\nDanube. These peoples, abandoning the lakes and marshes of the Po valley,\r\nspread southward over the peninsula. Because of this expansion and because\r\nof the striking similarity between the design of the _terramare_\r\nsettlements and that of the Roman fortified camps, it has been suggested\r\nthat they were the forerunners of the Italian peoples of historic times.\r\n\r\n*Other types of Bronze Age culture in Italy.* The Neolithic population of\r\nnorthern Italy developed a Bronze Age civilization under the stimulus of\r\ncontact with the _terramare_ people and the lake-dwellers. In the southern\r\npart of the peninsula and in Sicily, however, the Bronze Age developed\r\nmore independently, although showing decided traces of influences from the\r\neastern Mediterranean. Only in its later stages does it show the effect of\r\nthe southward migration of the builders of the pile villages.\r\n\r\n*The Iron Age.* The prehistoric Iron Age in Italy has left extensive\r\nremains in the northern and central regions, but such is by no means the\r\ncase in the south. The most important center of this civilization was at\r\nVillanova, near Bologna. Here, again, we have to do with a new type of\r\ncivilization, which is not a development of the _terramare_ culture. In\r\naddition to the use of iron, this age is marked by the practice of\r\ncremation, with the employment of burial urns of a distinctive type,\r\nplaced in well tombs (_tombe a pozzo_). In Etruria, to the south of the\r\nApennines, the Early Iron Age is of the Villanova type. It seems fairly\r\ncertain that both in Umbria and in Etruria this civilization is the work\r\nof the Umbrians, who at one time occupied the territory on both sides of\r\nthe Apennines. Regarding the migration of the Umbrians into Italy we know\r\nnothing, but it seems probable that their civilization had its rise in\r\ncentral Europe. The later Iron Age civilization both in Etruria and\r\nnorthward of the Apennines has been identified as that of the Etruscans.\r\n\r\n*Latium.* In Latium the Iron Age civilization is a development under\r\nVillanovan influences. Here a distinctive feature is the use of a\r\nhut-shaped urn to receive the ashes of the dead. This urn was itself\r\ndeposited in a larger burial urn. This civilization is that of the\r\nhistoric Latins, to whom belong also the hill villages of Latium and the\r\nwalled towns, constructed between the eighth and the sixth centuries B. C.\r\n\r\nElsewhere in the northern part of Italy in the Iron Age we have to do with\r\na culture developing out of that of the _terramare_ period. Likewise in\r\nthe east and south of the peninsula the Iron Age is a local development\r\nunder outside stimulus.\r\n\r\nThe preceding sketch of the rise of civilization in Italy has brought us\r\ndown to the point where we have to do with the peoples who occupied\r\nItalian soil at the beginning of the historic period, for from the sixth\r\ncentury it is possible to attempt a connected historical record of the\r\nmovements of these Italian races.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\n         THE PEOPLES OF HISTORIC ITALY: THE ETRUSCANS; THE GREEKS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         I. THE PEOPLES OF ITALY\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the close of the sixth century B. C., the soil of Italy was occupied by\r\nmany peoples of diverse language and origin.\r\n\r\n*The Ligurians.* The northwest corner of Italy, including the Po valley as\r\nfar east as the river Ticinus and the coast as far south as the Arno, was\r\noccupied by the Ligurians.\r\n\r\n*The Veneti.* On the opposite side of the continental part of Italy, in\r\nthe lowlands to the north of the Po between the Alps and the Adriatic,\r\ndwelt the Veneti, whose name is perpetuated in modern Venice. They are\r\ngenerally believed to have been a people of Illyrian origin.\r\n\r\n*The Euganei.* In the mountain valleys, to the east and west of Lake\r\nGarda, lived the Euganei, a people of little historical importance, whose\r\nracial connections are as yet unknown.\r\n\r\n*The Etruscans.* The central plain of the Po, between the Ligurians to the\r\nwest and the Veneti to the east, was controlled by the Etruscans. Their\r\nterritory stretched northwards to the Alps and eastwards to the Adriatic\r\ncoast. They likewise occupied the district called after them, Etruria, to\r\nthe south of the Apennines, between the Arno and the Tiber. Throughout all\r\nthis area the Etruscans were the dominant element, although it was partly\r\npeopled by subject Ligurians and Italians. Etruscan colonies were also\r\nestablished in Campania.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: The Peoples of Italy about 500 B. C.]\r\n\r\n*The Italians.* Over the central and southwestern portion of the peninsula\r\nwere spread a number of peoples speaking more or less closely related\r\ndialects of a common, Indo-germanic, tongue. Of these, the Latini, the\r\nAurunci (Ausones), the Osci (Opici), the Oenotri, and the Itali occupied,\r\nin the order named, the western coast from the Tiber to the Straits of\r\nRhegium. Between the valley of the upper Tiber and the Adriatic were the\r\nUmbri, while to the south of these, in the valleys of the central\r\nApennines and along the Adriatic coast, were settled the so-called\r\nSabellian peoples, chief of whom were the Sabini, the Picentes, the\r\nVestini, the Frentani, the Marsi, the Aequi, the Hernici, the Volsci, and\r\nthe Samnites. As we have noted, one of these peoples, the Itali, gave\r\ntheir name to the whole country to the south of the Alps, and eventually\r\nto this group of peoples in general, whom we call Italians, as distinct\r\nfrom the other races who inhabited Italy in antiquity.\r\n\r\n*The Iapygians.* Along the eastern coast from the promontory of Mt.\r\nGarganus southwards were located the Iapygians; most probably, like the\r\nVeneti, an Illyrian folk.\r\n\r\n*The Greeks.* The western and southern shores of Italy, from the Bay of\r\nNaples to Tarentum, were fringed with a chain of Hellenic settlements.\r\n\r\n*The peoples of Sicily.* The Greeks had likewise colonized the eastern and\r\nsouthern part of the island of Sicily. The central portion of the island\r\nwas still occupied by the Sicans and the Sicels, peoples who were in\r\npossession of Sicily prior to the coming of the Greeks, and whom some\r\nregard as an Italian, others as a Ligurian, or Iberian, element. In the\r\nextreme west of Sicily were wedged in the small people of the Elymians,\r\nanother ethnographic puzzle. Here too the Phoenicians from Carthage had\r\nfirmly established themselves.\r\n\r\n*Iberians in Sardinia and Corsica.* The inhabitants of Sardinia and\r\nCorsica, islands which were unaffected by the migrations subsequent to the\r\nNeolithic Age, are believed to have been of the same stock as the Iberians\r\nof the Spanish peninsula. The Etruscans had their colonies in eastern\r\nCorsica and the Carthaginians had obtained a footing on the southern and\r\nwestern coasts of Sardinia.\r\n\r\nFrom this survey of the peoples of Italy at the close of the sixth century\r\nB. C., we can see that to the topographical obstacles placed by nature in\r\nthe path of the political unification of Italy there was added a still\r\nmore serious difficulty—that of racial and cultural antagonism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            II. THE ETRUSCANS\r\n\r\n\r\n*Etruria.* About the opening of the eighth century, the region to the\r\nnorth of the Tiber, west and south of the Apennines, was occupied by the\r\npeople whom the Greeks called Tyrseni or Tyrreni, the Romans Etrusci or\r\nTusci, but who styled themselves Rasenna. Their name still clings to this\r\nsection of Italy (_la Toscana_), which to the Romans was known as Etruria.\r\n\r\n*The origin of the Etruscans.* Racially and linguistically the Etruscans\r\ndiffered from both Italians and Hellenes, and their presence in Italy was\r\nlong a problem to historians. Now, however, it is generally agreed that\r\ntheir own ancient tradition, according to which they were immigrants from\r\nthe shores of the Aegean Sea, is correct. They were probably one of the\r\npre-Hellenic races of the Aegean basin, where a people called Tyrreni were\r\nfound as late as the fifth century B. C., and it has been suggested that\r\nthey are to be identified with the _Tursha_, who appear among the Aegean\r\ninvaders of Egypt in the thirteenth century. Leaving their former abode\r\nduring the disturbances caused by the Hellenic occupation of the Aegean\r\nislands and the west coast of Asia Minor, they eventually found a new home\r\non the western shore of Italy. Here they imposed their rule and their\r\ncivilization upon the previous inhabitants. The subsequent presence of the\r\ntwo elements in the population of Etruria is well attested by\r\narchaeological evidence.\r\n\r\n*Walled towns.* The Etruscans regularly built their towns on hill-tops\r\nwhich admitted of easy defence, but, in addition, they fortified these\r\ntowns with strong walls of stone, sometimes constructed of rude polygonal\r\nblocks and at other times of dressed stone laid in regular courses.\r\n\r\n*Tombs.* However, the most striking memorials of the presence of the\r\nEtruscans are their elaborate tombs. Their cemeteries contain sepulchres\r\nof two types—trench tombs (_tombe a fossa_) and chamber tombs (_tombe a\r\ncamera_). The latter, a development of the former type, are hewn in the\r\nrocky hillsides. The Etruscans practised inhumation, depositing the dead\r\nin a stone sarcophagus. However, under the influence of the Italian\r\npeoples with whom they came into contact, they also employed cremation to\r\na considerable extent. Their larger chamber tombs were evidently family\r\nburial vaults, and were decorated with reliefs cut on their rocky walls or\r\nwith painted friezes, from which we derive most of our information\r\nregarding the Etruscan appearance, dress, and customs. Objects of\r\nPhoenician and Greek manufacture found in these tombs show that the\r\nEtruscans traded with Carthage and the Greeks as early as the seventh\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n*Etruscan industries.* The Etruscans worked the iron mines of Elba and the\r\ncopper deposits on the mainland. Their bronzes, especially their mirrors\r\nand candelabra, enjoyed high repute even in fifth-century Athens. Their\r\ngoldsmiths, too, fashioned elaborate ornaments of great technical\r\nexcellence. Etruria also produced the type of black pottery with a high\r\npolish known as _bucchero nero_.\r\n\r\n*Etruscan art.* In general, Etruscan art as revealed in wall paintings and\r\nin the decorations of vases and mirrors displays little originality in\r\nchoice of subjects or manner of treatment. In most cases it is a direct\r\nand not too successful imitation of Greek models, rarely attaining the\r\ngrace and freedom of the originals.\r\n\r\n*Architecture.* In their architecture, however, although even here\r\naffected by foreign influences, the Etruscans displayed more originality\r\nand were the teachers of the Romans and other Italians. They made great\r\nuse of the arch and vault, they created distinctive types of column and\r\n_atrium_ (both later called Etruscan) and they developed a form of temple\r\narchitecture, marked by square structures with a high _podium_ and a\r\nportico as deep as the _cella_. Their mural architecture has been referred\r\nto already.\r\n\r\n*Writing.* Knowledge of the art of writing reached the Etruscans from the\r\nGreek colony of Cyme, whence they adopted the Chalcidian form of the Greek\r\nalphabet. Several thousand inscriptions in Etruscan have been preserved,\r\nbut so far all attempts to translate their language have failed.\r\n\r\n*Religion.* The religion of the Etruscans was characterized by the great\r\nstress laid upon the art of divination and augury. Certain features of\r\nthis art, especially the use of the liver for divination, appear to\r\nstrengthen the evidence that connects the Etruscans with the eastern\r\nMediterranean. For them the after-world was peopled by powerful, malicious\r\nspirits: a belief which gives a gloomy aspect to their religion. Their\r\ncircle of native gods was enlarged by the addition of Hellenic and Italian\r\ndivinities and their mythology was greatly influenced by that of Greece.\r\n\r\n*Commerce.* The Etruscans were mariners before they settled on Italian\r\nsoil and long continued to be a powerful maritime people. They early\r\nestablished commercial relations with the Carthaginians and the Greeks, as\r\nis evidenced by the contents of their tombs and the influence of Greece\r\nupon their civilization in general. But they, as well as the\r\nCarthaginians, were jealous of Greek expansion in the western\r\nMediterranean, and in 536 a combined fleet of these two peoples forced the\r\nPhoceans to abandon their settlement on the island of Corsica. For the\r\nGreeks their name came to be synonymous with pirates, on account of their\r\ndepredations which extended even as far as the Aegean.\r\n\r\n*Government.* In Etruria there existed a league of twelve Etruscan cities.\r\nHowever, as we know of as many as seventeen towns in this region, it is\r\nprobable that several cities were not independent members of the league.\r\nThis league was a very loose organization, religious rather than political\r\nin its character, which did not impair the sovereignty of its individual\r\nmembers. Only occasionally do several cities seem to have joined forces\r\nfor the conduct of military enterprises. The cities at an early period\r\nwere ruled by kings, but later were under the control of powerful\r\naristocratic families, each backed by numerous retainers.\r\n\r\n*Expansion north of the Apennines, in Latium and in Campania.* In the\r\ncourse of the sixth century the Etruscans crossed the Apennines and\r\noccupied territory in the Po valley northwards to the Alps and eastwards\r\nto the Adriatic. Somewhat earlier, towards the end of the seventh century,\r\nthey forced their way through Latium, established themselves in Campania,\r\nwhere they founded the cities of Capua and Nola, and gradually completed\r\nthe subjugation of Latium itself. This marks the extreme limits of their\r\nexpansion in Italy, and before the opening of the fifth century their\r\npower was already on the wane.\r\n\r\n*The decline of the Etruscan power.* It was about this time that Rome\r\nfreed itself from Etruscan domination, while the other Latins, aided by\r\nAristodemus, the Greek tyrant of Cyme, inflicted a severe defeat upon the\r\nEtruscans at Aricia (505 B. C.). A land and sea attack upon Cyme itself,\r\nin 474, resulted in the destruction of the Etruscan fleet by Hieron,\r\ntyrant of Syracuse. The year 438 B. C. saw the end of the Etruscan power\r\nin Campania with the fall of Capua before a Samnite invasion. Not long\r\nafterwards, as we shall see, a Celtic invasion drove them from the valley\r\nof the Po. The explanation of this rapid collapse of the Etruscan power\r\noutside Etruria proper is that, owing to the lack of political unity,\r\nthese conquests were not national efforts but were made by independent\r\nbands of adventurers. These failed to assimilate the conquered populations\r\nand after a few generations were overthrown by native revolutions or\r\noutside invasions, especially since there was no Etruscan nation to\r\nprotect them in time of need. Thus failure to develop a strong national\r\nstate was the chief reason why the Etruscans did not unite Italy under\r\ntheir dominion, as they gave promise of doing in the course of the sixth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n*The significance of the Etruscans in the history of Italy.* Our general\r\nimpression of the Etruscans is that they were a wealthy, luxury-loving\r\npeople, quick to appreciate and adopt the achievements of others, but\r\nsomewhat lacking in originality themselves. Cruel, they took delight in\r\ngladiatorial combats, especially in Campania, where the Romans learned\r\nthis custom. Bold and energetic warriors, as their conquests show, they\r\nlacked the spirit of discipline and coöperation, and were incapable of\r\ndeveloping a stable political organization. Nevertheless, they played an\r\nimportant part in the cultural development of Italy, even though here\r\ntheir chief mission was the bringing of the Italian peoples into contact\r\nwith Hellenic civilization.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             III. THE GREEKS\r\n\r\n\r\n*Greek colonization.* As early as the eighth century the Greeks had begun\r\ntheir colonizing activity in the western Mediterranean, and, in the course\r\nof the next two centuries, they had settled the eastern and southern\r\nshores of Sicily, stretched a chain of settlements on the Italian coast\r\nfrom Tarentum to the Bay of Naples, and established themselves at the\r\nmouth of the Rhone and on the Riviera. The opposition of Carthage shut\r\nthem out from the western end of Sicily, and from Spain; the Etruscans\r\nclosed to them Italy north of the Tiber; while the joint action of these\r\ntwo peoples excluded them from Sardinia and Corsica.\r\n\r\nIn the fifth century these Greek cities in Sicily and Italy were at the\r\nheight of their power and prosperity. In Sicily they had penetrated from\r\nthe coast far into the interior where they had brought the Sicels under\r\ntheir domination. By the victory of Himera, in 480 B. C., Gelon of\r\nSyracuse secured the Sicilian Greeks in the possession of the greater part\r\nof the island and freed them from all danger of Carthaginian invasion for\r\nover seventy years. Six years later, his brother and successor, Hieron, in\r\na naval battle off Cyme, struck a crushing blow at the Etruscan naval\r\npower and delivered the mainland Greeks from all fear of Etruscan\r\naggression. The extreme southwestern projection of the Italian peninsula\r\nhad passed completely under Greek control, but north as far as Posidonia\r\nand east to Tarentum their territory did not extend far from the seaboard.\r\nIn these areas they had occupied the territory of the Itali and\r\nOenotrians, while on the north of the Bay of Naples Cyme, Dicaearchia, and\r\nNeapolis (Naples) were established in the land of the Opici (Osci). The\r\nname Great Greece, given by the Hellenes to South Italy, shows how firmly\r\nthey were established there.\r\n\r\n*Lack of political unity.* However, the Greeks possessed even less\r\npolitical cohesion than did the Etruscans. Each colony was itself a\r\ncity-state, a sovereign independent community, owning no political\r\nallegiance to its mother city. Thus New Greece reproduced all the\r\npolitical characteristics of the Old. Only occasionally, in times of\r\nextreme peril, did even a part of the Greek cities lay aside their mutual\r\njealousies and unite their forces in the common cause. Such larger\r\npolitical structures as the tyrants of Syracuse built up by the\r\nsubjugation of other cities were purely ephemeral, barely outliving their\r\nfounders. The individual cities also were greatly weakened by incessant\r\nfactional strife within their walls. The result of this disunion was to\r\nrestrict the Greek expansion and, eventually, to pave the way for the\r\nconquest of the western Greeks by the Italian “barbarians.”\r\n\r\n*The decline of the Greek power in Italy and Sicily.* Even before the\r\nclose of the fifth century, the decline of the Western Greeks had begun.\r\nIn Italy their cities were subjected to repeated assaults from the\r\nexpanding Samnite peoples of the central Apennines. In 421, Cyme fell into\r\nthe hands of a Samnite horde, and from that time onwards the Greek cities\r\nfurther south were engaged in a struggle for existence with the Lucanians\r\nand the Bruttians, peoples of Samnite stock. In Sicily the Carthaginians\r\nrenewed their assault upon the Greeks in 408 B. C. For a time (404–367)\r\nthe genius and energy of Dionysius I, tyrant of Syracuse, welded the\r\ncities of the island and the mainland into an empire which enabled them to\r\nmake head against their foes. But his empire had only been created by\r\nbreaking the power of the free cities, and after his death they were left\r\nmore disunited and weaker than ever. After further warfare, by 339,\r\nCarthage remained in permanent occupation of the western half of the\r\nisland of Sicily, while in Italy only a few Greek towns, such as Tarentum,\r\nThurii, and Rhegium, were able to maintain themselves, and that with ever\r\nincreasing difficulty, against the rising tide of the Italians. Even by\r\nthe middle of the fourth century an observant Greek predicted the speedy\r\ndisappearance of the Greek language in the west before that of the\r\nCarthaginians or Oscans. However, their final struggles must be postponed\r\nfor later consideration.\r\n\r\n*The rôle of the Greeks in Italian history.* It was the coming of the\r\nGreeks that brought Italy into the light of history, and into contact with\r\nthe more advanced civilization of the eastern Mediterranean. From the\r\nGreek geographers and historians we derive our earliest information\r\nregarding the Italian peoples, and they, too, shaped the legends that long\r\npassed for early Italian history. The presence of the Greek towns in Italy\r\ngave a tremendous stimulus to the cultural development of the Italians,\r\nboth by direct intercourse and indirectly through the agency of the\r\nEtruscans. In this spreading of Greek influences, Cyme, the most northerly\r\nof the Greek colonies and one of the earliest, played a very important\r\npart. It was from Cyme that the Romans as well as the Etruscans took their\r\nalphabet. The more highly developed Greek political institutions, Greek\r\nart, Greek literature, and Greek mythology found a ready reception among\r\nthe Italian peoples and profoundly affected their political and\r\nintellectual progress. Traces of this Greek influence are nowhere more\r\nnoticeable than in the case of Rome itself, and the cultural ascendancy\r\nwhich Greece thus early established over Rome was destined to last until\r\nthe fall of the Roman Empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 PART II\r\n\r\n\r\n                THE PRIMITIVE MONARCHY AND THE REPUBLIC:\r\n                    FROM PREHISTORIC TIMES TO 27 B. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: The Environs of Rome]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\n                  EARLY ROME TO THE FALL OF THE MONARCHY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              I. THE LATINS\r\n\r\n\r\n*Latium and the Latins.* The district to the south of the Tiber, extending\r\nalong the coast to the promontory of Circeii and from the coast inland to\r\nthe slopes of the Apennines, was called in antiquity Latium. Its\r\ninhabitants, at the opening of the historic period, were the Latins\r\n(_Latini_), a branch of the Italian stock, perhaps mingled with the\r\nremnants of an older population.\r\n\r\nThey were mainly an agricultural and pastoral people, who had settled on\r\nthe land in _pagi_, or cantons, naturally or artificially defined rural\r\ndistricts. The _pagus_ constituted a rude political and religious unit.\r\nIts population lived scattered in their homesteads. If some few of the\r\nhomesteads happened to be grouped together, they constituted a _vicus_,\r\nwhich, however, had neither a political nor a religious organization.\r\n\r\nAt one or more points within the cantons there soon developed small towns\r\n(_oppida_), usually located on hilltops and fortified, at first with\r\nearthen, later with stone, walls. These towns served as market-places and\r\nas points of refuge in time of danger for the people of the _pagus_. There\r\ndeveloped an artisan and mercantile element, and there the aristocratic\r\nelement of the population early took up their abode, i. e., the wealthier\r\nlandholders, who could leave to others the immediate oversight of their\r\nestates. And so these _oppida_ became the centers of government for the\r\nsurrounding _pagi_. It is very doubtful if the Latins as a whole were ever\r\nunited in a single state. But even if that had once been the case, this\r\nloosely organized state must early have been broken up into a number of\r\nsmaller units. These were the various _populi_; that is, the cantons with\r\ntheir _oppida_. The names of some sixty-five of these towns are known, but\r\nbefore the close of the sixth century many of the smaller of them had been\r\nmerged with their more powerful neighbors.\r\n\r\n*The Latin League.* The realization of the racial unity of the Latins was\r\nexpressed in the annual festival of Jupiter Latiaris celebrated on the\r\nAlban Mount. For a long time also the Latin cities formed a league, of\r\nwhich there were thirty members according to tradition. Actually, about\r\nthe middle of the fifth century there were only some eight cities\r\nparticipating in the association upon an independent footing. The central\r\npoint of the league was the grove and temple of Diana at Aricia, and it\r\nwas in the neighborhood of Aricia that the meetings of the assembly of the\r\nleague were held. The league possessed a very loose organization, but we\r\nknow of a common executive head—the Latin dictator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         II. THE ORIGINS OF ROME\r\n\r\n\r\n*The site of Rome.* Rome, the Latin _Roma_, is situated on the Tiber about\r\nfifteen miles from the sea. The Rome of the later Republic and the Empire,\r\nthe City of the Seven Hills, included the three isolated eminences of the\r\nCapitoline, Palatine and Aventine, and the spurs of the adjoining plateau,\r\ncalled the Quirinal, Viminal, Esquiline, and Caelian. Other ground, also\r\non the left bank of the river, and likewise part of Mount Janiculum,\r\nacross the Tiber, were included in the city. But this extent was only\r\nattained after a long period of growth, and early Rome was a town of much\r\nsmaller area.\r\n\r\n*The growth of the city.* Late Roman historians placed the founding of\r\nRome about the year 753 B. C., and used this date as a basis for Roman\r\nchronology. However, it is absolutely impossible to assign anything like a\r\ndefinite date for the establishment of the city. Excavations have revealed\r\nthat in the early Iron Age several distinct settlements were perched upon\r\nthe Roman hills, separated from one another by low, marshy ground, flooded\r\nby the Tiber at high water. These were probably typical Latin walled\r\nvillages (_oppida_).\r\n\r\nAt a very early date some of these villages formed a religious union\r\ncommemorated in the festival of the Septimontium or Seven Mounts. These\r\n_montes_ were crests of the Palatine, Esquiline and Caelian hills, perhaps\r\neach the site of a separate settlement.\r\n\r\nBut the earliest city to which we can with certainty give the name of Rome\r\nis of later date than the establishment of the Septimontium. It is the\r\nRome of the Four Regions—the Palatina, Esquilina, Collina and Sucusana\r\n(later Suburana)—which included the Quirinal, Viminal, Esquiline, Caelian\r\nand Palatine hills, as well as the intervening low ground. Within the\r\nboundary of this city, but not included in the four regions, was the\r\nCapitoline, which had separate fortifications and served as the citadel\r\n(_arx_). It may be that the organization of this city of the Four Regions\r\nwas effected by Etruscan conquerors, for the name Roma seems to be of\r\nEtruscan origin, and, for the Romans, an _urbs_, as they called Rome, was\r\nmerely an _oppidum_ of which the limits had been marked out according to\r\nEtruscan ritual. The consecrated boundary line drawn in this manner was\r\ncalled the _pomerium_.\r\n\r\nThe Aventine Hill, as well as the part of the plateau back of the\r\nEsquiline, was only brought within the city walls in the fourth century,\r\nand remained outside the _pomerium_ until the time of Claudius.\r\n\r\nThe location of Rome, on the Tiber at a point where navigation for\r\nsea-going vessels terminated and where an island made easy the passage\r\nfrom bank to bank, marked it as a place of commercial importance. It was\r\nat the same time the gateway between Latium and Etruria and the natural\r\noutlet for the trade of the Tiber valley. Furthermore, its central\r\nposition in the Italian peninsula gave it a strategic advantage in its\r\nwars for the conquest of Italy. But the greatness of Rome was not the\r\nresult of its geographic advantages: it was the outgrowth of the energy\r\nand political capacity of its people, qualities which became a national\r\nheritage because of the character of the early struggles of the Roman\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is very probable that the historic population of Rome was the\r\nresult of a fusion of several racial elements—Latin, Sabine, Etruscan, and\r\neven pre-Italian, nevertheless the Romans were essentially a Latin people.\r\nIn language, in religion, in political institutions, they were\r\ncharacteristically Latin, and their history is inseparably connected with\r\nthat of the Latins as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         III. THE EARLY MONARCHY\r\n\r\n\r\n*The tradition.* The traditional story of the founding of Rome is mainly\r\nthe work of Greek writers of the third century B. C., who desired to find\r\na link between the new world-power Rome and the older centers of\r\ncivilization: while the account of the reign of the Seven Kings is a\r\nreconstruction on the part of Roman annalists and antiquarians, intended\r\nto explain the origins of Roman political and religious institutions. And,\r\nin fact, owing to the absence of any even relatively contemporaneous\r\nrecords (a lack from which the Roman historians suffered as well as\r\nourselves) it is impossible to attempt an historical account of the period\r\nof kingly rule. We can improve but little on the brief statement of\r\nTacitus (i, 1 _Ann._)—“At first kings ruled the city Rome.”\r\n\r\n*The kingship.* The existence of the kingship itself is beyond dispute,\r\nowing to the strength of the Roman tradition on this point and the\r\nsurvival of the title _rex_ or king in the priestly office of _rex\r\nsacrorum_. It seems certain, too, that the last of the Roman kings were\r\nEtruscans and belong to the period of Etruscan domination in Rome and\r\nLatium. As far as can be judged, the Roman monarchy was not purely\r\nhereditary but elective within the royal family, like that of the\r\nprimitive Greek states, where the king was the head of one of a group of\r\nnoble families, chosen by the nobles and approved by the people as a\r\nwhole. About the end of the sixth century the kingship was deprived of its\r\npolitical functions, and remained at Rome solely as a lifelong priestly\r\noffice. It is possible that there had been a gradual decline of the royal\r\nauthority before the growing power of the nobles as had been the case at\r\nAthens, but it is very probable that the final step in this change\r\ncoincided with the fall of an Etruscan dynasty and the passing of the\r\ncontrol of the state into the hands of the Latin nobility (about 508\r\nB. C.).\r\n\r\n*Institutions of the regal period.* The royal power was not absolute, for\r\nthe exercise thereof was tempered by custom, by the lack of any elaborate\r\nmachinery of government, and by the practical necessity for the king to\r\navoid alienating the good will of the community. The views of the\r\naristocracy were voiced in the Senate (_senatus_) or Council of Elders,\r\nwhich developed into a council of nobles, a body whose functions were\r\nprimarily advisory in character. From a very early date the Roman people\r\nwere divided into thirty groups called _curiae_, and these _curiae_ served\r\nas the units in the organization of the oldest popular assembly—the\r\n_comitia curiata_. Membership in the _curiae_ was probably hereditary, and\r\neach _curia_ had its special cult, which was maintained long after the\r\n_curiae_ had lost their political importance. The primitive assembly of\r\nthe _curiae_ was convoked at the pleasure of the king to hear matters of\r\ninterest to the whole community. It did not have legislative power, but\r\nsuch important steps as the declaration of war or the appointment of a new\r\n_rex_ required its formal sanction.\r\n\r\n*Expansion under the kings.* Under the kings Rome grew to be the chief\r\ncity in Latium, having absorbed several smaller Latin communities in the\r\nimmediate neighborhood, extended her territory on the left bank of the\r\nTiber to the seacoast, where the seaport of Ostia was founded, and even\r\nconquered Alba Longa, the former religious center of the Latins. It is\r\npossible that by the end of the regal period Rome exercised a general\r\nsuzerainty over the cities of the Latin plain. The period of Etruscan\r\ndomination failed to alter the Latin character of the Roman people and\r\nleft its traces chiefly in official paraphernalia, religious practices\r\n(such as the employment of _haruspices_), military organization, and in\r\nEtruscan influences in Roman art.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         IV. EARLY ROMAN SOCIETY\r\n\r\n\r\n*The Populus Romanus.* The oldest name of the Romans was _Quirites_, a\r\nname which long survived in official phraseology, but which was superseded\r\nby the name _Romani_, derived from that of the city itself. The whole body\r\nof those who were eligible to render military service, to participate in\r\nthe public religious rites and to attend the meetings of the popular\r\nassembly, with their families, constituted the Roman state—the _populus\r\nRomanus_.\r\n\r\n*Patricians and Plebeians.* At the close of the regal period the _populus\r\nRomanus_ comprised two distinct social and political classes. These were\r\nthe Patricians and the Plebeians. A very considerable element of the\r\nlatter class was formed by the Clients. These class distinctions had grown\r\nup gradually under the economic and social influences of the early state;\r\nand, in antiquity, were not confined to Rome but appeared in many of the\r\nGreek communities also at a similar stage of their development.\r\n\r\nThe Patricians were the aristocracy. Their influence rested upon their\r\nwealth as great landholders, their superiority in military equipment and\r\ntraining, their clan organization, and the support of their clients. Their\r\nposition in the community assured to them political control, and they had\r\nearly monopolized the right to sit in the Senate. The members of the\r\nSenate were called collectively _patres_, whence the name _patricii_\r\n(patricians) was given to all the members of their class. The patricians\r\nformed a group of many _gentes_, or clans, each an association of\r\nhouseholds (_familiae_) who claimed descent from a common ancestor. Each\r\nmember of a _gens_ bore the gentile name and had a right to participate in\r\nits religious practices (_sacra_).\r\n\r\n*Patrons and clients.* Apparently, the clients were tenants who tilled the\r\nestates of the patricians, to whom they stood for a long time in a\r\ncondition of economic and political dependence. Each head of a patrician\r\nhousehold was the patron of the clients who resided on his lands. The\r\nclients were obliged to follow their patrons to war and to the political\r\narena, to render them respectful attention, and, on occasion, pecuniary\r\nsupport. The patron, in his turn, was obliged to protect the life and\r\ninterests of his client. For either patron or client to fail in his\r\nobligations was held to be sacrilege. This relationship, called\r\n_patronatus_ on the side of the patron, _clientela_ on that of the client,\r\nwas hereditary on both sides. The origin of this form of clientage is\r\nuncertain and it is impossible for us to form a very exact idea of\r\nposition of the clients in the early Roman state, for the like-named\r\ninstitution of the historic republican period is by no means the one that\r\nprevailed at the end of the monarchy. The older, serf-like, conditions had\r\ndisappeared; the relationship was voluntarily assumed, and its\r\nobligations, now of a much less serious nature, depended for their\r\nobservance solely upon the interest of both parties.\r\n\r\nThe patrician aristocracy formed a social caste, the product of a long\r\nperiod of social development, and this caste was enlarged in early times\r\nby the recognition of new _gentes_ as possessing the qualifications of the\r\nolder clans (_patres maiorum_ and _minorum gentium_). But eventually it\r\nbecame a closed order, jealous of its prerogatives and refusing to\r\nintermarry with the non-patrician element.\r\n\r\n*The Plebs.* This latter constituted the plebeians or _plebs_. They were\r\nfree citizens—the less wealthy landholders, tradesmen, craftsmen, and\r\nlaborers—who lacked the right to sit in the Senate and so had no direct\r\nshare in the administration. Beyond question, however, they were included\r\nin the _curiae_ and had the right to vote in the _comitia curiata_. Nor is\r\nthere any proof of a racial difference between plebeians and patricians.\r\nIt is not easy to determine to what degree the clients participated in the\r\npolitical life of the community, yet, in the general use of the term, the\r\nplebs included the clients, who later, under the republic, shared in all\r\nthe privileges won by the plebeians and who, consequently, must have had\r\nthe status of plebeians in the eye of the state.\r\n\r\nThe sharp social and political distinction between nobles and commons,\r\nbetween patricians and plebeians, is the outstanding feature of early\r\nRoman society, and affords the clue to the political development of the\r\nearly republican period.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Roman Expansion in Italy to 265 B.

C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   I. TO THE CONQUEST OF VEII—392 B. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n*The alliance of Rome and the Latin League, about 486 B. C.* At the close\r\nof the regal period Rome appears as the chief city in Latium, controlling\r\na territory of some 350 sq. miles to the south of the Tiber. But the fall\r\nof the monarchy somewhat weakened the position of Rome, for it brought on\r\nhostilities with the Etruscan prince Lars Porsena of Clusium, which\r\nresulted in a defeat for Rome and the forced acceptance of humiliating\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nThis defeat naturally broke down whatever suzerainty Rome may have\r\nexercised over Latium and necessitated a readjustment of the relations\r\nbetween Rome and the Latin cities. A treaty attributed by tradition to\r\nSpurius Cassius was finally concluded between Rome on the one hand and the\r\nLatin league on the other, which fixed the relations of the two parties\r\nfor nearly one hundred and fifty years. By this agreement the Romans and\r\nthe Latin league formed an offensive and defensive military alliance, each\r\nparty contributing equal contingents for joint military enterprises and\r\ndividing the spoils of war, while the Latins at Rome and the Romans in the\r\nLatin cities enjoyed the private rights of citizenship. The small people\r\ncalled the Hernici, situated to the east of Latium, were early included in\r\nthis alliance. This union was cemented largely through the common dangers\r\nwhich threatened the dwellers in the Latin plain from the Etruscans on the\r\nnorth and the highland Italian peoples to the east and south. For Rome it\r\nwas of importance that the Latin cities interposed a barrier between the\r\nterritory of Rome and her most aggressive foes, the Aequi and the Volsci.\r\n\r\n*Wars with the Aequi and Volsci.* Of the details of these early wars we\r\nknow practically nothing. However, archæological evidence seems to show\r\nthat about the beginning of the fifth century B. C. the Latins sought an\r\noutlet for their surplus population in the Volscian land to the south\r\neast. Here they founded the settlements of Signia, Norba and Satricum. But\r\nthis expansion came to a halt, and about the middle of the fifth century\r\nthe Volsci still held their own as far north as the vicinity of Antium,\r\nwhile the Aequi were in occupation of the Latin plain as far west as\r\nTusculum and Mt. Algidus. Towards the end of the century, however, under\r\nRoman leadership the Latins resumed their expansion at the expense of both\r\nthese peoples.\r\n\r\n*Veii.* In addition to these frequent but not continuous wars, the Romans\r\nhad to sustain a serious conflict with the powerful Etruscan city of Veii,\r\nsituated about 12 miles to the north of Rome, across the Tiber. The causes\r\nof the struggle are uncertain, but war broke out in 402, shortly after the\r\nRomans had gained possession of Fidenae, a town which controlled a\r\ncrossing of the Tiber above the city of Rome. According to tradition the\r\nRomans maintained a blockade of Veii for eleven years before it fell into\r\ntheir hands. It was in the course of this war that the Romans introduced\r\nthe custom of paying their troops, a practice which enabled them to keep a\r\nforce under arms throughout the entire year if necessary. Veii was\r\ndestroyed, its population sold into slavery, and its territory\r\nincorporated in the public land of Rome. By this annexation the area of\r\nthe Roman state was nearly doubled.\r\n\r\nRecent excavations have shown that Veii was a place of importance from the\r\ntenth to the end of the fifth century B. C., that Etruscan influence\r\nbecame predominant there in the course of the eighth century, and that, at\r\nthe time of its destruction, it was a flourishing town, which, like Rome\r\nitself, was in contact with the Greek cultural influences then so powerful\r\nthroughout the Italian peninsula.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         II. THE GALLIC INVASION\r\n\r\n\r\n*The Gauls in the Po Valley.* But scarcely had the Romans emerged\r\nvictorious from the contest with Veii when a sudden disaster overtook them\r\nfrom an unexpected quarter. Towards the close of the fifth century various\r\nCeltic tribes crossed the Alpine passes and swarmed down into the Po\r\nvalley. These Gauls overcame and drove out the Etruscans, and occupied the\r\nland from the Ticinus and Lake Maggiore southeastwards to the Adriatic\r\nbetween the mouth of the Po and Ancona. This district was subsequently\r\nknown as Gallia Cisalpina. The Gauls formed a group of eight tribes, which\r\nwere often at enmity with one another. Each tribe was divided into many\r\nclans, and there was continual strife between the factions of the various\r\nchieftains. They were a barbarous people, living in rude villages and\r\nsupporting themselves by cattle-raising and agriculture of a primitive\r\nsort. Drunkenness and love of strife were their characteristic vices: war\r\nand oratory their passions. In stature they were very tall; their eyes\r\nwere blue and their hair blond. Brave to recklessness, they rushed naked\r\ninto battle, and the ferocity of their first assault inspired terror even\r\nin the ranks of veteran armies. Their weapons were long, two-edged swords\r\nof soft iron, which frequently bent and were easily blunted, and small\r\nwicker shields. Their armies were undisciplined mobs, greedy for plunder,\r\nbut disinclined to prolonged, strenuous effort, and utterly unskilled in\r\nsiege operations. These weaknesses nullified the effects of their\r\nvictories in the field and prevented their occupation of Italy south of\r\nthe Apennines.\r\n\r\n*The sack of Rome.* In 387 B. C., a horde of these marauders crossed the\r\nApennines and besieged Clusium. Thence, angered, as was said, by the\r\nhostile actions of Roman ambassadors, they marched directly upon Rome. The\r\nRomans marched out with all their forces and met the Gauls near the Allia,\r\na small tributary of the Tiber above Fidenae. The fierce onset of the\r\nGauls drove the Roman army in disorder from the field. Many were slain in\r\nthe rout and the majority of the survivors were forced to take refuge\r\nwithin the ruined fortifications of Veii. Deprived of their help and\r\nlacking confidence in the weak and ill-planned walls, the citizen body\r\nevacuated Rome itself and fled to the neighboring towns. The Capitol,\r\nhowever, with its separate fortifications, was left with a small garrison.\r\nThe Gauls entered Rome and sacked the city, but failed to storm the\r\ncitadel. Apparently they had no intention of settling in Latium and\r\ntherefore, after a delay of seven months, upon information that the Veneti\r\nwere attacking their new settlements in the Po valley, they accepted a\r\nransom of 1000 pounds of gold (about $225,000) for the city and marched\r\noff home. The Romans at once reoccupied and rebuilt their city, and soon\r\nafter provided it with more adequate defences in the new wall of stone\r\nlater known as the Servian wall.\r\n\r\n*Later Gallic invasions.* For some years the Gauls ceased their inroads,\r\nbut in 368 another raid brought them as far as Alba in the land of the\r\nAequi, and the Romans feared to attack the invaders. However, when a fresh\r\nhorde appeared in 348 the Romans were prepared. They and their allies\r\nblocked the foe’s path, and the Gauls retreated, fearing to risk a battle.\r\nRome thus became the successful champion of the Italian peoples, their\r\nbulwark against the barbarian invaders from the north. In 334 the Gauls\r\nand the Romans concluded peace and entered upon a period of friendly\r\nrelations which lasted for the rest of the fourth century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n III. THE DISRUPTION OF THE LATIN LEAGUE AND THE ROMAN ALLIANCE WITH THE\r\n                        CAMPANIANS: 387–334 B. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Wars with the Aequi, Volsci, and Etruscans.* The disaster that overtook\r\nRome created a profound impression throughout the civilized world and was\r\nnoted by contemporary Greek writers. But the blow left no permanent\r\ntraces, for only the city, not the state, had been destroyed. It is true\r\nthat, encouraged by their enemy’s defeat, the Aequi, Volsci and the\r\nEtruscan cities previously conquered by Rome took up arms, but each met\r\ndefeat in turn. Rome retained and consolidated her conquests in southern\r\nEtruria. Part of the land was allotted to Romans for settlement and four\r\ntribal districts were organized there. On the remainder, two Latin\r\ncolonies, Sutrium (383) and Nepete (372), were founded. The territory won\r\nfrom the Volsci was treated in like manner.\r\n\r\nIn 354 the Romans concluded an alliance with the Samnite peoples of the\r\nsouth central Apennines. Probably this agreement was reached in view of\r\nthe common fear of Gallic invasions and because both parties were at war\r\nwith the smaller peoples dwelling between Latium and Campania, so that a\r\ndelimitation of their respective spheres of action was deemed advisable.\r\nAt any rate, it was in the course of the next few years that Rome\r\ncompletely subdued the Volsci and Aurunci, while the Samnites overran the\r\nland of the Sidicini.\r\n\r\n*The Latin War, 338–336 B. C.* Not long afterwards, the Latins, allied\r\nwith the Campanians, were at war with Rome. Even before this, subsequent\r\nto the Gallic capture of Rome, the Romans had fought with individual Latin\r\ncities, but now practically all the cities of the Latin league were in\r\narms against them. It is possible that both Latins and Campanians felt\r\ntheir independence threatened by the expansion and alliance of the Romans\r\nand the Samnites and that this was the underlying cause of hostilities.\r\nHowever that may be, within two years the Latins had been completely\r\nsubdued. The Latin league ceased to exist. The individual cities, except\r\nTibur and Praeneste, lost their independence and were incorporated in the\r\nRoman state. These two cities preserved their autonomy and concluded new\r\ntreaties with Rome.\r\n\r\n*Alliance with the Campanians, about 334 B. C.* At about the same time,\r\nthe majority of the cities of Campania, including Capua, concluded an\r\nalliance with Rome upon the conditions of the Roman alliance with the old\r\nLatin league. These cities retained their independence, and extended and\r\nreceived the rights of _commercium_ and _connubium_ with Rome. This meant\r\nthat the citizen of one city could transact any business in another that\r\nwas party to this agreement with the assurance that his contract would be\r\nprotected by the law of the second city, while if he married a woman of\r\nthat city his children would be considered legitimate heirs to his\r\nproperty. By virtue of this close alliance, the military resources of\r\nCampania were arrayed on the side of Rome, and Rome and Campania presented\r\na united front against their common foes. The Roman sphere of influence\r\nwas thus extended as far south as the Bay of Naples.\r\n\r\nAfter the Latin war, the territory previously won from the Volsci and\r\nAurunci was largely occupied by settlements of Roman citizens or by Latin\r\ncolonies, for even after the dissolution of the Latin league the Romans\r\nmade use of this type of colony to secure their conquests, as well as to\r\nrelieve the surplus population of Rome and Latium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      IV. WARS WITH THE SAMNITES, GAULS AND ETRUSCANS: 325–280 B. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n*The conflict of Rome and the Samnites in Campania.* The alliance of Rome\r\nand Campania brought the Romans into immediate contact with the Samnites\r\nand converted these former friends into enemies, since the Samnites\r\nregarded Campania as their legitimate field for expansion and refused to\r\nsubmit to its passing under the aegis of Rome. However, they had been\r\nunable to prevent the union of Rome with Capua and other cities, for at\r\nthe time they were engaged with another enemy, the Tarentines, who were\r\nassisted by Alexander, king of the Molossians (334–331).\r\n\r\nThe Samnites formed a loose confederacy of kindred peoples, with no strong\r\ncentral authority. Therefore, although bold and skilful warriors, they\r\nwere at a disadvantage in a long struggle where unity of control and\r\ncontinuity of policy became of decisive importance. Here Rome had the\r\nadvantage, an advantage that was increased by the alliances Rome was able\r\nto form in the course of her wars against this enemy. For generations the\r\nexcess population of the Samnite valleys had regularly overflowed into the\r\nlowland coast areas, and such migrations had given rise to the Lucanians,\r\nBruttians, and a large part of the Campanians themselves. However, the\r\ndanger of being submerged by fresh waves of Samnites caused the peoples\r\nwhose territories bordered on Samnium to look to Rome for support, and so\r\nRome found allies in the Central Italian peoples, and in the Apulians and\r\nthe Lucanians.\r\n\r\n*The beginning of hostilities, 325–4.* Hostilities broke out over the\r\noccupation of Naples by the Romans and its incorporation in the Roman\r\nalliance. This step was taken in the interests of the party in the city\r\nthat sought Roman protection, and was accomplished in spite of Samnite\r\nopposition. The war was waged chiefly in Campania, in the valley of the\r\nupper Liris, and in Apulia. In 318, a Roman army attempting to penetrate\r\nfrom Campania into Samnium was cut off and compelled to surrender at the\r\nCaudine Pass. It is probable that as a result of this defeat the Romans\r\ngave up Fregellae (occupied in 328) and other territory on the Liris, and\r\nthey may even have made a temporary truce. However, hostilities were soon\r\nresumed. Once again, in 314, the Samnites won a great victory, this time\r\nat Lautulae not far south of Circeii, and their party acquired control in\r\nCampania. But this temporary success was quickly counterbalanced by Roman\r\nvictories in Campanian territory.\r\n\r\nThe war was prolonged by an Etruscan attack upon Roman territory that\r\nnecessitated a division of the Roman forces. But in two campaigns (309–7\r\nB. C.), in the course of which a Roman army advanced through Umbria and\r\ninvaded northern Etruria, the cities which had taken up arms against Rome\r\nwere forced to make peace.\r\n\r\nThe war against the Samnites could be energetically prosecuted again. By\r\nthe construction of the Via Appia the Romans secured a military highway\r\nfrom Rome to Capua which greatly facilitated the conduct of operations in\r\nCampania. It is probable, too, that the reorganization of the Roman army,\r\nwhich dates from this period, was beginning to bear fruit. From both\r\nCampania and Apulia the Romans took the offensive, and several severe\r\ndefeats forced the Samnites to seek peace in 304. They retained their\r\nindependence, but the disputed territory on their borders fell to Rome.\r\n\r\nIt was about the close of this war that the Aequi, Marsi, Marrucini,\r\nFrentani, Paeligni, some of the Umbrians, and other of the peoples of\r\nCentral Italy became federate allies of Rome. Apulia likewise passed under\r\nRoman control. New Latin colonies and new tribal districts marked the\r\nexpansion of Roman territory.\r\n\r\n*Wars with the Samnites, Gauls and Etruscans, 298–80 B. C.* In 298 war\r\nbroke out again between the Romans and Samnites, apparently because the\r\nLucanians had deserted the Roman alliance for the Samnites. Soon the\r\nSamnites allied themselves with the Etruscans and Gauls, and succeeded in\r\nuniting the forces of the three peoples in Umbria. But this host was\r\nannihilated by the Romans in the battle of Sentinum (295). With this\r\nvictory all danger for Rome was over. By systematically ravaging the\r\nenemy’s country the Roman consuls in 290 B. C. forced the Samnites to sue\r\nfor peace. They entered the Roman alliance, and a portion of their land\r\nwas incorporated in the _ager publicus_ of Rome. A similar fate overtook\r\nthe Sabines and Picentes, who had taken sides with the Samnites.\r\n\r\nThe war with the Etruscans and the Gauls still dragged on. But in 285,\r\nafter suffering a severe blow at the hands of the Gallic Senones, the\r\nRomans took vigorous action and drove this people from the land between\r\nAncona and the Rubicon—the _ager Gallicus_. In the same year the tribe of\r\nthe Boii, with Etruscan allies, penetrated as far as the Vadimonian Lake,\r\nwhere the Romans inflicted upon them a crushing defeat. Another Roman\r\nvictory in the next year brought the Boii to terms, and soon the Etruscan\r\ncities one by one submitted to Rome, until by 280 all were Roman allies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n           V. THE ROMAN CONQUEST OF SOUTH ITALY: 281–270 B. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Italians and Greeks in South Italy.* The only parts of the peninsula that\r\nhad not yet acknowledged the Roman overlordship were the lands of the\r\nLucanians and Bruttians and the few Greek cities in the south that still\r\nmaintained their independence. Of these latter the chief was Tarentum, a\r\ncity of considerable commercial importance. From the middle of the fourth\r\ncentury these cities had been engaged in continual warfare with the\r\nLucanians and Messapians, and in the course of their struggles Tarentum\r\nhad come to assume the rôle of protector of the Hellenes in Italy. But\r\neven this city had only been able to make head against its foes through\r\nassistance obtained from Greece. In 338, King Archidamus of Sparta, and in\r\n331 Alexander, king of Epirus and uncle of Alexander the Great, fell\r\nfighting in the service of the Italian Greeks. In 303, Cleonymus of\r\nSparta, more fortunate than his predecessors, compelled the Lucanians to\r\nconclude a peace, which probably included the Romans, at that moment their\r\nallies. A little later (c. 300 B. C.) Agathocles, king of Syracuse,\r\nassisted the Tarentines against the same foe, and incorporated in his own\r\nkingdom the Bruttians and the Greek cities in the southwest. But with his\r\ndeath in 289, his kingdom, like that of Dionysius I, fell apart and the\r\nGreeks in the west were left again without a protector. Consequently, when\r\nthe Lucanians renewed their attacks upon Thurii, that city, being unable\r\nto find succor in Greece and distrusting Tarentum, appealed to Rome (282).\r\nRome gave ear to the call, relieved and garrisoned Thurii. But this action\r\nbrought Roman ships of war into the Gulf of Tarentum contrary to an\r\nagreement between the two cities (perhaps that of 303). Enraged, the\r\nTarentines attacked the Roman fleet, sank some Roman triremes, and then\r\noccupied Thurii. The ensuing Roman demands for reparation were rejected,\r\ntheir ambassadors insulted, and war began (281).\r\n\r\n*The war with Pyrrhus and Tarentum.* The Tarentines were able to unite\r\nagainst Rome the Messapians, Lucanians, Samnites and Bruttians, but Roman\r\nsuccesses in the first campaign forced them to call in the aid of Pyrrhus,\r\nking of Epirus. Pyrrhus was probably the most skilful Greek general of the\r\ntime, and he brought with him into Italy an army organized and equipped\r\naccording to the Macedonian system of Alexander the Great, which had\r\nbecome the standard in the Greek world. His force comprised 20,000\r\nheavy-armed infantry forming the phalanx, and 3,000 Thessalian cavalry.\r\nBesides, he had a number of war elephants; animals which had figured on\r\nGreek battlefields since Ipsus (301). The first engagement was fought near\r\nHeraclea (280) and after a severe struggle the Romans were driven from the\r\nfield. The superior generalship of Pyrrhus, and the consternation caused\r\nby his war elephants, won the day, but his losses were very heavy, and he\r\nhimself was wounded. As fighters the Romans had shown themselves the equal\r\nof the foe, and their tactical organization, perfected in the Samnite\r\nWars, had proved its value in its first encounter with that developed by\r\nthe military experts of Greece. As a result of his victory at Heraclea,\r\nPyrrhus was able to advance as far north as Latium, but withdrew again\r\nwithout accomplishing anything of importance. The next year, he won\r\nanother hard-fought battle near Ausculum in Apulia. Thereupon the Romans\r\nbegan negotiations which Pyrrhus welcomed, sending the orator Cineas to\r\nRome to represent him. But, before an agreement was reached, the\r\nCarthaginians, who feared the intervention of Pyrrhus in Sicily, offered\r\nthe Romans assistance. Their proffer was accepted; the negotiations with\r\nPyrrhus ended; and Rome and Carthage bound themselves not to make a\r\nseparate agreement with the common foe, while the Carthaginian fleet was\r\nto coöperate with the Romans.\r\n\r\n*Pyrrhus in Sicily, 278–5 B. C.* Nevertheless, Pyrrhus determined to\r\nanswer an appeal from the Sicilian Greeks and to leave Italy for Sicily.\r\nAfter the death of Agathocles, tyrant and king of Syracuse (317–289), who\r\nhad played the rôle of another Dionysius I, the Greeks in Sicily had\r\nfallen upon evil days. The Carthaginians had renewed their attacks upon\r\nthem, and a new foe had appeared in the Mamertini, Campanian mercenary\r\nsoldiers who had seized Messana and made it their headquarters for raiding\r\nthe territory of the Greek cities. Caught between these two enemies, the\r\nGreeks appealed to Pyrrhus who came to their aid, possibly with the hope\r\nof uniting Sicily under his own control. His success was immediate. The\r\nCarthaginians were forced to give up all their possessions except\r\nLilybaeum, and Pyrrhus stood ready to carry the war into Africa. But, at\r\nthis juncture, the exactions that he laid upon his Sicilian allies and\r\ntheir fear that his victory would make him their permanent master caused\r\nthem to desert his cause and make peace with their foes. Deprived of their\r\nassistance, and seeing that his allies in Italy were hard pressed by the\r\nRomans, he abandoned his Sicilian venture.\r\n\r\n*The end of the war.* Pyrrhus returned to Italy, with the loss of his\r\nfleet in a naval battle with the Carthaginians, reorganized his forces,\r\nand advanced into Lucania or Samnium to meet the Romans. While manœuvering\r\nfor an attack, one of his divisions sustained a severe repulse at\r\nBeneventum (275), whereupon he abandoned the offensive and retired to\r\nTarentum. Leaving a garrison in that city he withdrew the rest of his\r\nforces to Greece, with the intention of attacking Antigonus Gonatas in\r\nMacedonia. His initial successes in this enterprise led him to withdraw\r\nhis garrison from Tarentum and abandon the Western Greeks to their fate.\r\nThereupon the Romans soon reduced the Samnites and Lucanians, while\r\nTarentum and the other Greek cities, one after another, were forced to\r\nsubmit and enter the Roman alliance. By 270 B. C., all South Italy had in\r\nthis way been added to the Roman dominions.\r\n\r\nBy 265 B. C. after a few more brief struggles with revolting or still\r\nunsubdued communities in central and northern Italy, the Romans had\r\ncompleted the subjugation of the entire Italian peninsula.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        VI. THE ROMAN CONFEDERACY\r\n\r\n\r\n*Roman foreign policy.* By wars and alliances Rome had united Italy. But\r\nit is not to be supposed that this was a goal consistently pursued through\r\nmany generations by Roman statesmen. Probably it was not until the end was\r\nnearly within sight that the Romans realized whither their policy was\r\nleading them. Indeed, it is certain that many of Rome’s wars were waged in\r\ndefence of Rome’s territory or that of the Roman allies. This seems\r\nparticularly true of the period prior to the Gallic inroad of 387.\r\nAccording to the ancient Roman formula employed in declaring war, that\r\nuttered by the Fetiales, war was looked upon as the last means to obtain\r\nreparation for wrongs that were suffered at the hands of the enemy. Yet,\r\nalthough the Roman attitude in such matters was doubtless at one time\r\nsincere, we may well question how long this sincerity continued, and\r\nwhether the injuries complained of were not sometimes the result of Roman\r\nprovocation. Such attempts to place the moral responsibility for a war\r\nupon the enemy are common to all ages and are not always convincing.\r\nHowever, if we may not convict the Romans of aggressive imperialism prior\r\nto 265, at any rate the methods which they pursued in their relations with\r\nthe other peoples of Italy made their domination inevitable in view of the\r\nRoman national character and their political and military organization.\r\nThese methods early became established maxims of Roman foreign policy. The\r\nRomans, whenever possible, waged even their defensive wars offensively,\r\nand rarely made peace save with a beaten foe. As a rule, the enemy was\r\nforced to conclude a treaty with Rome which placed his forces at the\r\ndisposal of the Roman state. This treaty was regarded as perpetually\r\nbinding, and any attempt to break off the relationship it established was\r\nregarded as a _casus belli_. Possibly, the Romans looked upon this as the\r\nonly policy which would guarantee peace on their borders, but it\r\ninevitably led to further wars, for it resulted in the continuous\r\nextension of the frontiers defended by Rome and so continually brought\r\nRome into contact and conflict with new peoples. Nor were the voluntary\r\nallies of Rome allowed to leave the Roman alliance: such action was\r\ntreated as equivalent to a declaration of war and regularly punished with\r\nseverity. This practice gradually transformed Rome’s independent into\r\ndependent allies. From the middle of the fourth century, it seems that\r\nRome deliberately sought to prevent the development of a strong state in\r\nthe southern part of Italy, and to this end gladly took under her\r\nprotection weaker communities that felt themselves threatened by stronger\r\nneighbors, although such action inevitably led to war with the latter.\r\nFurthermore, a conquered state frequently lost a considerable part of its\r\nterritory. Portions of this land were set aside for the foundation of\r\nfortress colonies to protect the Roman conquests and overawe the\r\nconquered. The rest was incorporated in the _ager Romanus_ to the profit\r\nof both the rich proprietors and the landless citizens. Usually, the Roman\r\nsoldiers shared directly in the distribution of the movable spoils of war;\r\nsometimes a huge booty, as after the subjugation of the Sabines and\r\nPicentes in 290. A long series of successful and profitable wars, for Rome\r\nwas ultimately victorious in every struggle after 387, had engendered in\r\nthe Roman people a self-confidence and a martial spirit which soon led\r\nthem to conquests beyond the confines of Italy. During this period of\r\nexpansion within Italy, Roman policy had been guided by the Senate, a body\r\nof unrecorded statesmen of wide outlook and great determination, who not\r\nonly made Rome mistress of the peninsula but succeeded in laying enduring\r\nfoundations for the Roman power.\r\n\r\n*Rome and Italy.* But although Italy was united under the Roman hegemony\r\nit by no means formed a single state. Rather it was an agglomerate of many\r\nstates and many peoples, speaking different tongues and having different\r\npolitical institutions. The largest single element, however, was formed by\r\nthe Roman citizens. These were to be found not only in the city of Rome\r\nand its immediate neighborhood, but also settled in the rural tribal\r\ndistricts (35 in number after 241) organized on conquered territory\r\nthroughout the peninsula. In addition, groups of 300 citizens had been\r\nsettled in various harbor towns as a sort of resident garrison to protect\r\nRoman interests. In all, down to 183 B. C., 22 of these maritime colonies\r\nwere established, whose members in view of their special duties were\r\nexcused from active service with the Roman legions. All these were full\r\nRoman citizens, but there were others who, while enjoying the private\r\nrights of Roman citizenship, lacked the right to vote or to hold office\r\n(_cives sine suffragio_). Such were the inhabitants of most of the old\r\nLatin communities and some others which had been absorbed in the Roman\r\nstate. Such communities were called _municipia_ (municipalities). Some of\r\nthese were permitted to retain their own magistrates and city\r\norganization: others lacked this privilege of local autonomy. Of the\r\nformer class, Gabii, conquered during the monarchy, is said to have been\r\nthe prototype. This municipal system had the advantage of providing for\r\nlocal administration and at the same time reconciling the conquered city\r\nto the loss of its freedom. It was a distinctly Roman institution, and\r\nshows the wisdom of the early Roman statesmen who thus marked out the way\r\nfor the complete absorption of the vanquished into the Roman citizen body,\r\nwhich was thus strengthened to meet its continually increasing military\r\nburdens. By 265, the Roman territory in Italy had an area of about 10,000\r\nsquare miles. It extended along the west coast from the neighborhood of\r\nCaere southwards to the southern border of Campania, and from the latitude\r\nof Rome it stretched northeastwards through the territory of the Sabini to\r\nthe Adriatic coast, where the lands of the Picentes and the Senones had\r\nbeen incorporated in the _ager Romanus_.\r\n\r\n*The Latin colonies.* Of the non-Romans in Italy the people most closely\r\nbound to Rome by ties of blood and common interests were the Latin allies.\r\nOutside the few old Latin cities, that had not been absorbed by Rome in\r\n338, these were the inhabitants of the Latin colonies, of which\r\nthirty-five were founded on Italian soil. Prior to the destruction of the\r\nLatin League seven of these colonies had been established, whose settlers\r\nhad been drawn half from the Latin cities and half from Rome. After 338,\r\nthese colonies remained in alliance with Rome, and those subsequently\r\nfounded received the same status. But for these the colonists were all\r\nsupplied by Rome. These colonists had to surrender their Roman citizenship\r\nand become Latins, but if any one of them left a son of military age in\r\nhis place he had the right to return to Rome. Each colony had its own\r\nadministration, usually modelled upon that of Rome, and enjoyed the rights\r\nof _commercium_ and _connubium_ both with Rome and with the other Latin\r\ncolonies. These settlements were towns of considerable size, having 2,500,\r\n4,000 or 6,000 colonists, each of whom received a grant of 30 or 50\r\n_iugera_ (20 or 34 acres) of land. Founded at strategic points on\r\nconquered territory, they formed one of the strongest supports of the\r\nRoman authority: at the same time colonization of this character served to\r\nrelieve over-population and satisfy land-hunger in Rome and Latium. In all\r\ntheir internal affairs the Latin cities were sovereign communities,\r\npossessing, in addition to their own laws and magistrates, the rights of\r\ncoinage and census. Their inhabitants constituted the _nomen Latinum_,\r\nand, unlike the Roman _cives sine suffragio_, did not serve in the Roman\r\nlegions but formed separate detachments of horse and foot.\r\n\r\n*The Italian allies.* The rest of the peoples of Italy, Italian, Greek,\r\nIllyrian and Etruscan, formed the federate allies of Rome—the _socii\r\nItalici_. These constituted some 150 separate communities, city or tribal,\r\neach bound to Rome by a special treaty (_foedus_), whereby its specific\r\nrelations to Rome were determined. In all these treaties, however, there\r\nwas one common feature, namely, the obligation to lend military aid to\r\nRome and to surrender to Rome the control over their diplomatic relations\r\nwith other states. Their troops were not incorporated in the legions, but\r\nwere organized as separate infantry and cavalry units (_cohortes_ and\r\n_alae_), raised, equipped and officered by the communities themselves.\r\nHowever, they were under the orders of the Roman generals, and if several\r\nallied detachments were combined in one corps the whole was under a Roman\r\nofficer. The allied troops, moreover, received their subsistence from Rome\r\nand shared equally with the Romans in the spoils of war. In the case of\r\nthe seaboard towns, especially the Greek cities, this military obligation\r\ntook the form of supplying ships and their crews, whence these towns were\r\ncalled naval allies (_socii navales_). All the federate allies had\r\n_commercium_, and the majority _connubium_ also, with Rome. Apart from the\r\nforegoing obligations towards Rome, each of the allied communities was\r\nautonomous, having its own language, laws and political institutions.\r\n\r\nHowever, a strong bond of sympathy existed between the local aristocracies\r\nof many of the Italian towns and the senatorial order at Rome. As we have\r\nseen, the foreign relations of Rome were directed by the Senate, which\r\nrepresented the views of the wealthier landed proprietors, and it was only\r\nnatural that the senators should have sought to ally themselves with the\r\ncorresponding social class in other states. This class represented the\r\nmore conservative, and, from the Roman point of view, more dependable\r\nelement, while the support of Rome assured to the local aristocracies the\r\ncontrol within their own communities. Consequently there developed a\r\ncommunity of interest between the Senate and the propertied classes among\r\nthe Roman allies.\r\n\r\nThus Rome was at the head of a military and diplomatic alliance of many\r\nseparate states, whose sole point of contact was that each was in alliance\r\nwith Rome. As yet there was no such thing as an Italian nation. Still it\r\nwas from the time that this unity was effected that the name _Italia_\r\nbegan to be applied to the whole of the peninsula and the term _Italici_\r\nwas employed, at first by foreigners, but later by themselves, to\r\ndesignate its inhabitants.(1)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\n           THE CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF ROME TO 287 B. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          I. THE EARLY REPUBLIC\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the Romans were engaged in acquiring political supremacy in Italy,\r\nthe Roman state itself underwent a profound transformation as the result\r\nof severe internal struggles between the patrician and the plebeian\r\nelements.\r\n\r\n*The constitution of the early republic: the magistrates.* Upon the\r\noverthrow of the monarchy, the Romans set up a republican form of\r\ngovernment, where the chief executive office was filled by popular\r\nelection. At the head of the state were two annually elected magistrates,\r\nor presidents, called at first praetors but later consuls. They possessed\r\nthe _auspicium_ or the right to consult the gods on behalf of the state,\r\nand the _imperium_, which gave them the right of military command, as well\r\nas administrative and judicial authority. Both enjoyed these powers in\r\nequal measure and, by his veto, the one could suspend the other’s action.\r\nThus from the beginning of the Republic annuality and collegiality were\r\nthe characteristics of the Roman magistracy. Nevertheless, the Romans\r\nrecognized the advantage of an occasional concentration of all power in\r\nthe state in the hands of a single magistrate and so, in times of\r\nemergency, the consuls, acting upon the advice of the senate, nominated a\r\ndictator, who superseded the consuls themselves for a maximum period of\r\nsix months. The dictator, or _magister populi_, as he was called in early\r\ntimes, appointed as his assistant a master of the horse (_magister\r\nequitum_).\r\n\r\n*The Senate.* At the side of the magistrates stood the Senate, a body of\r\nthree hundred members, who acted in an advisory capacity to the officials,\r\nand possessed the power of sanctioning or vetoing laws passed by the\r\nAssembly of the People. The senators were nominated by the consuls from\r\nthe patrician order and held office for life.\r\n\r\n*The comitia curiata.* During the early years of the Republic, the popular\r\nAssembly, which had the power of electing the consuls and passing or\r\nrejecting such measures as the latter brought before it, was probably the\r\nold _comitia curiata_. But, as we shall see, it was soon superseded in\r\nmost of its functions by a new primary assembly.\r\n\r\n*The priesthoods.* In Rome a special branch of the administration was that\r\nof public religion, which dealt with the official relations of the\r\ncommunity towards its divine protectors. This sphere was under the\r\ndirection of a college of priests, at whose head stood the _pontifex\r\nmaximus_. Special priestly brotherhoods or guilds cared for the\r\nperformance of particular religious ceremonies, while the use of\r\ndivination in its political aspect was under the supervision of the\r\ncollege of augurs. With the exception of the _pontifex maximus_, who was\r\nelected by the people from an early date, the priesthoods were filled by\r\nnomination or coöptation. The Roman priesthood did not form a separate\r\ncaste in the community but, since these priestly offices were held by the\r\nsame men who, in another capacity, acted as magistrates and senators, the\r\nRoman official religion was subordinated to the interests of the state and\r\ntended more and more to assume a purely formal character.\r\n\r\n*The lines of constitutional development.* Both the consulate and the\r\npriestly offices, like the senate, were open only to patricians, who thus\r\nenjoyed a complete monopoly of the administration. They had been\r\nresponsible for the overthrow of the monarchy, and, consequently, at the\r\nbeginning of the Republic they formed the controlling element in the Roman\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nFrom conditions such as these the constitutional development in Rome to\r\n287 B. C. proceeded along two distinct lines. In the first place there was\r\na gradual change in the magistracy by the creation of new offices with\r\nfunctions adapted to the needs of a progressive, expanding, community;\r\nand, secondly, there was a long struggle between the patricians and the\r\nplebeians, resulting from the desire of the latter to place themselves in\r\na position of political, legal, and social equality with the former.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n II. THE ASSEMBLY OF THE CENTURIES AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MAGISTRACY\r\n\r\n\r\n*The Assembly of the Centuries.* At a time which cannot be determined with\r\nprecision, but most probably early in the fifth century, the Assembly of\r\nthe Curiae was superseded for elective and legislative purposes by a new\r\nassembly, called the Assembly of the Centuries (_comitia centuriata_), of\r\nwhich the organization was modelled upon the contemporary military\r\norganization of the state. The land-holding citizens were divided into\r\nfive classes, according to the size of their properties, and to each class\r\nwas allotted a number of voting groups, divided equally between the men\r\nunder 46 years of age (_juniores_) and those who were 46 and over\r\n(_seniores_). The number of voting groups, called centuries, in each class\r\nwas possibly in proportion to the total assessment of that class. Thus the\r\nfirst class had eighty centuries, the second, third, and fourth classes\r\nhad twenty each, while the fifth class had thirty. Outside of the classes,\r\nat first six but later eighteen centuries were allotted to those eligible\r\nto serve as cavalry (_equites_) whose property qualification was at least\r\nthat of the first class; four centuries were given to musicians and\r\nmechanics who performed special military service; and one century was\r\nassigned to the landless citizens (_proletarii_). Of the total of 193\r\ncenturies, the first class had eighty and the equestrians eighteen:\r\ntogether ninety-eight, or a majority of the voting units. As they had the\r\nprivilege of voting before the other classes, they could, if unanimous,\r\ncontrol the Assembly. The term century, it must be noted, which in its\r\noriginal military sense had been applied to a detachment of 100 men, in\r\npolitical usage was applied to a voting group of indefinite numbers. The\r\norganization of this Assembly probably was not completed until near the\r\nend of the fourth century, when the basis for enrollment in the five\r\ncensus classes was changed from landed estate to the total property\r\nassessment reckoned in terms of the copper _as_.\r\n\r\nThe old Assembly of the Curiae was not abolished, but lost all its\r\npolitical functions except the right to pass a law conferring the\r\n_imperium_ upon the magistrates elected by the Assembly of the Centuries.\r\nIn addition to electing these magistrates the Centuriate Assembly had the\r\nsole right of declaring war, voted upon measures presented to it by the\r\nconsuls, and acted as a supreme court of appeal for citizens upon whom a\r\nmagistrate had pronounced the death penalty. However, the measures which\r\nthe Assembly approved had for a long time to receive subsequent\r\nratification by the patrician senators (the _patrum auctoritas_) before\r\nthey became laws binding on the community. Finally, the importance of this\r\nsanction was nullified by the requirement of the Publilian (339?) and\r\nMaenian Laws that it be given before the voting took place.\r\n\r\n*The magistracy: quaestors and aediles.* It has been indicated already\r\nthat the expansion of the Roman magistracy was effected through the\r\ncreation of new offices, to which were assigned duties that had previously\r\nbeen performed by the consular pair or new functions required by the rise\r\nof new conditions in the Roman state.\r\n\r\nThe first change came in connection with the quaestorship. About the\r\nmiddle of the fifth century, the officials called quaestors, who had\r\npreviously been appointed by the consuls to act as their assistants, were\r\nraised to the status of magistrates and elected by popular vote. Their\r\nnumber was originally two, but in 421 it was increased to four, two of\r\nwhom acted as officers of the public treasury (_quaestores aerarii_),\r\nwhile two were assigned to assist the consuls when the latter took the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nAt approximately the same time that the quaestorship became an elective\r\noffice, the two curators of the temple of Ceres, called aediles, likewise\r\nattained the position of public officials. They henceforth acted as police\r\nmagistrates, market commissioners, and superintendents of public works. As\r\nwe shall have occasion to note in another connection, these aediles were\r\nelected from among the plebeians.\r\n\r\n*The censors: 443, 435?* The next new office to be created was that of\r\ncensor. The censorship was a commission called into being at five-year\r\nintervals and exercised by two men for a period of eighteen months. The\r\noriginal duty of the censors was to take the census of the citizens and\r\ntheir property as a basis for registering the voters in the five classes,\r\nfor compiling the roster of those eligible for military service, and for\r\nlevying the property tax (_tributum_). Probably the reason for the\r\nestablishment of this office is to be sought in the heavy demands that\r\nsuch duties made upon the services of the consuls and the inability of the\r\nlatter to complete the census within any one consular year. The censors\r\nfurther had charge of the letting of public contracts, and, by the end of\r\nthe fourth century had acquired the right to compile the list of the\r\nsenators. As this latter duty involved an enquiry into the habits of life\r\nof the senators, there arose that aspect of the censors’ power which alone\r\nhas survived in the modern conception of a censorship.\r\n\r\n*The military tribunes with consular power.* During the period 436 to 362,\r\non fifty-one occasions the consular college of two was displaced by a\r\nboard of military tribunes with consular power (_tribuni militum consulari\r\npotestate_). The number of these military tribunes varied: there were\r\nnever less than three, more often four or six, while two boards had eight\r\nand nine tribunes respectively. As their name indicates, these were\r\nessentially military officers, and this lends support to the tradition\r\nthat they were elected because the military situation frequently demanded\r\nthe presence in the state of more than two magistrates who could exercise\r\nthe _imperium_.\r\n\r\n*The praetorship.* However, by 362 this method of meeting the increased\r\nburdens of the magistracy was definitely abandoned. For the future two\r\nconsuls were annually elected, and, in addition, a magistrate called the\r\npraetor, to whom was assigned the administration of the civil jurisdiction\r\nwithin the city. The praetor was regarded as a minor colleague of the\r\nconsuls and held the _imperium_. Consequently, if need arose, he could\r\ntake command in the field or exercise the other consular functions.\r\n\r\n*The curule aediles.* In the same year there was established the curule\r\naedileship. The two curule aediles were at first elected from the\r\npatricians only, and, although their duties seem to have been the same as\r\nthose of the plebeian aediles, their office was considered more honorable\r\nthan that of the latter.\r\n\r\n*Promagistrates.* The Roman magistrates were elected for one year only,\r\nand after 342 reëlection to the same office could only be sought after an\r\ninterval of ten years. This system entailed some inconveniences,\r\nespecially in the conduct of military operations, for in the case of\r\ncampaigns that lasted longer than one year the consul in command had to\r\ngive place to his successor as soon as his own term of office had expired.\r\nThus the state was unable to utilize for a longer period the services of\r\nmen who had displayed special military capacity. The difficulty was\r\neventually overcome by the prolongation, at the discretion of the Senate,\r\nof the command of a consul in the field for an indefinite period after the\r\nlapse of his consulship. The person whose term of office was thus extended\r\nwas no longer a consul, but acted “in the place of a consul” (_pro\r\nconsule_). This was the origin of the promagistracy. It first appeared in\r\nthe campaign at Naples in 325, and, although for a time employed but\r\nrarely, its use eventually became very widespread.\r\n\r\n*Characteristics of the magistracy.* Thus the Roman magistracy attained\r\nthe form that it preserved until the end of the Republic. It consisted of\r\na number of committees, each of which, with the exception of the\r\nquaestorship, had a separate sphere of action. But among these committees\r\nthere was a regularly established order of rank, running, from lowest to\r\nhighest, as follows: quaestors, aediles, censors, praetors, consuls. With\r\nthe exception of the censorship that was regularly filled by ex-consuls,\r\nthe magistracies were usually held in the above order. Magistrates of\r\nhigher rank enjoyed greater authority than all those who ranked below\r\nthem, and as a rule could forbid or annul the actions of the latter. A\r\nmagistrate could also veto the action of his colleague in office. In this\r\nway the consuls were able to control the activities of all other regular\r\nmagistrates. However, the extraordinary office of the dictatorship\r\noutranked the consulship and consequently the dictator could suspend the\r\naction of the consuls themselves. The unity that was thus given to the\r\nadministration by this conception of _maior potestas_ was increased by the\r\npresence of the Senate, a council whose influence over the magistracy grew\r\nin proportion as the consulate lost in power and independence through the\r\ncreation of new offices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            III. THE PLEBEIAN STRUGGLE FOR POLITICAL EQUALITY\r\n\r\n\r\n*The causes of the struggle.* Of greater moment in the early history of\r\nthe republic than the development of the magistracy was the persistent\r\neffort made by the plebeians to secure for themselves admission to all the\r\noffices and privileges that at the beginning of the republic were\r\nmonopolized by the patricians. Their demands were vigorously opposed by\r\nthe latter, whose position was sustained by tradition, by their control of\r\nthe organs of government, by individual and class prestige, and by the\r\nsupport of their numerous clients. But among the plebeians there was an\r\never increasing number whose fortunes ranked with those of the patricians\r\nand who refused to be excluded from the government. These furnished the\r\nleaders among the plebs. However, a factor of greater importance than the\r\npresence of this element in determining the final outcome of the struggle\r\nwas the demand made upon the military resources of the state by the\r\nnumerous foreign wars. The plebeian soldiers shared equally with the\r\npatricians in the dangers of the field, and equality of political rights\r\ncould not long be withheld from them. As their services were essential to\r\nthe state, the patrician senators were farsighted enough to make\r\nconcessions to their demands whenever a refusal would have led to civil\r\nwarfare. A great cause of discontent on the part of the plebs was the\r\nindebtedness of the poorer landholders, caused in great part by their\r\nenforced absence from their lands upon military service and the burden of\r\nthe _tributum_ or property tax levied for military purposes. Their\r\ncondition was rendered the more intolerable because of the operation of\r\nthe harsh debtor laws, which permitted the creditor to seize the person of\r\nthe debtor and to sell him into slavery.\r\n\r\nEvidence that discontent was rife at Rome may be found in the tradition of\r\nthree unsuccessful attempts to set up a tyranny, that is, to seize power\r\nby unconstitutional means, made by Spurius Cassius (478), Spurius Maelius\r\n(431), and Marcus Manlius (376), patricians who figure in later tradition\r\nas popular champions.\r\n\r\n*The tribunes of the plebs (466 B. C.), and the assembly of the tribes.*\r\nThe first success won by the plebeians was in securing protection against\r\nunjust or oppressive acts on the part of the patrician magistrates. In\r\n466, they forced the patricians to acquiesce in the appointment of four\r\ntribunes of the plebs, officers who had the right to extend protection to\r\nall who sought their aid, even against the magistrate in the exercise of\r\nhis functions.(2) The tribunes received power to make effective use of\r\nthis right from an oath taken by the plebeians that they would treat as\r\naccursed and put to death without trial any person who disregarded the\r\ntribune’s veto or violated the sanctity of his person. The character of\r\nthe tribunate and the basis of its power reveal it as the result of a\r\nrevolutionary movement and as existing in defiance of the patricians. The\r\ntribunes were elected in an assembly in which the voting units were\r\ntribes, and the number of the tribunes (four) suggests that this assembly\r\nwas at first composed of the citizens of the four city regions or tribes,\r\nand that it was the city plebs who were responsible for the establishment\r\nof the tribunate. In this assembly we have the origin of the _comitia\r\ntributa_ or Assembly of the Tribes.\r\n\r\nThe origin of these tribes is uncertain, but by the middle of the fifth\r\ncentury the Roman state was divided into twenty or twenty-one districts,\r\neach of which with the citizens resident therein constituted a _tribus_.\r\nFour of these were located in the city: the remainder were rural. In the\r\npreceding chapter we have seen how the number of the tribes was increased\r\nwith the incorporation of conquered territory within the Roman state and\r\nits occupation by Roman colonists. The tribes were artificial divisions of\r\nthe community, and served as a basis for the raising of the levy and the\r\n_tributum_.\r\n\r\n*Plebeian aediles.* Associated with the tribunes as officers of the plebs\r\nwere two aediles (_aediles plebi_). It has been conjectured that they were\r\noriginally the curators of the temple of Ceres (established 492?), which\r\nwas in a special sense a plebeian shrine. As we have seen they later\r\nbecame magistrates of the whole people.\r\n\r\n*The codification of the law.* About the middle of the fifth century the\r\nplebeians secured the codification and publication of the law. Hitherto\r\nthe law, which consisted essentially of customs and precedents, and was\r\nlargely sacral in character, had been known only to the magistrates and to\r\nthe priests, that is to members of the patrician order. At this time, two\r\ncommissions of ten men each, working in successive years (444–2?) drew up\r\nthese customs into a code, which, with subsequent additions, formed what\r\nwas later called the Law of the XII Tables. This code was in no sense a\r\nconstitution, but embodied provisions of both civil and criminal law, with\r\nrules for legal procedure and police regulations. Notable is the provision\r\nwhich guaranteed the right of appeal to the Assembly of the Centuries in\r\ncapital cases.\r\n\r\n*Development of the tribunate and the comitia tributa.* The years which\r\nsaw the publication of the code mark an important stage in the struggle of\r\nthe orders. Serious trouble arose between the patricians and the plebs\r\nunder the second college of law-givers, and the difference was only\r\nsettled by a treaty which restored the tribunate, that had been suspended\r\nwhen the decemvirs were first elected. Henceforth the number of tribunes\r\nwas ten instead of four and their position and powers received legal\r\nrecognition from the patricians. From this time on, too, the _comitia\r\ntributa_, now embracing all the tribes, the rural as well as the urban,\r\nwas a regular institution of the state. The Assembly of the Tribes was\r\noriginally, and perhaps always remained in theory, restricted to the\r\nplebeians. And it is improbable that the patricians ever sought to\r\nparticipate in it. At any rate, there is no adequate reason for believing\r\nin the existence of two assemblies of this sort, the one composed of both\r\npatricians and plebeians and the other of plebeians only.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly of the Tribes not only elected the plebeian tribunes and\r\naediles, but soon chose the quaestors also. Furthermore, the patrician\r\nmagistrates, finding this Assembly in many ways more convenient for the\r\ntransaction of public business than the Assembly of the Centuries which\r\nmet in the Campus Martius outside the _pomerium_ and required more time to\r\nregister its opinion because of the greater number of voting units, began\r\nto convene it to approve measures, which, if previously sanctioned by a\r\ndecree of the Senate, became law. The tribunes likewise presented\r\nresolutions to the Assembly of the Tribes, and these, too, if sanctioned\r\nby the Senate, were binding on the whole community. Such laws were called\r\nplebiscites (_plebi scita_) in contrast with the _leges_ passed by an\r\nassembly presided over by a magistrate with _imperium_. It became the\r\nambition of the tribunes to obtain for their plebiscites the force of law\r\nwithout regard to the Senate’s approval.\r\n\r\n*The lex Canuleia.* The social stigma which rested upon the plebeians\r\nbecause they could not effect a legal marriage with the patricians, a\r\ndisability that had been maintained by the law of the XII Tables, was\r\nremoved by the Canuleian Law in 437.\r\n\r\n*The plebs and the magistracy.* The plebeians did not rest content with\r\nhaving spokesmen and defenders in the tribunes: they also demanded\r\nadmission to the consulate and the Senate. In 421 plebeians were admitted\r\nto the quaestorship, and by that time the plebeian aediles could be looked\r\nupon as magistrates, but the patricians tenaciously maintained their\r\nmonopoly of the _imperium_ until, in 396, a plebeian was elected a\r\nmilitary tribune with consular power.(3)\r\n\r\nPerhaps the appearance of plebeian military tribunes at this time may be\r\nexplained on the ground that the vicissitudes of the war with Veii forced\r\nthe patricians to accept as magistrates the ablest available men in the\r\nstate even if of plebeian origin.\r\n\r\nWith the military tribunate the plebeians had held an office that\r\nconferred the right to the _imperium_. Consequently, when the consulship\r\nwas definitely reëstablished in 362, they could not logically be excluded\r\nfrom it. In 362 the first plebeian consul was elected, but it was not\r\nuntil 340 that the practice became established that one consul must, and\r\nthe other might, be a plebeian.\r\n\r\nAfter their admission to the consulship the plebeians were eligible to all\r\nthe other magistracies. They gained the dictatorship in 356, the\r\ncensorship in 351, and the praetorship in 337. Eventually, the curule\r\naedileship also was opened to them, and was held by patricians and\r\nplebeians in alternate years.\r\n\r\n*The plebs and the Senate.* Since the custom was early established that\r\nex-consuls, and later ex-praetors, should be enrolled in the Senate, with\r\nthe opening of these offices to the plebs the latter began to have an\r\never-increasing representation in that body. As distinguished from the\r\n_patres_ or patrician senators, the plebeians were called _conscripti_,\r\n“the enrolled,” and this distinction was preserved in the official formula\r\n_patres conscripti_ used in addressing the Senate. In this fusion of the\r\nleading plebeians with the patricians in the Senate we have the origin of\r\na new aristocracy in the Roman state: the so-called senatorial aristocracy\r\nor _nobilitas_. This consisted of a large group of influential patrician\r\nand plebeian families which, for some time at least, was continuously\r\nquickened and revivified by the accession of prominent plebeians who\r\nentered the Senate by way of the magistracies. Thus the Senate, by opening\r\nits ranks to the leaders of the plebs, contrived to emerge from the\r\nstruggle with its prestige and influence increased rather than impaired.\r\n\r\n*Appius Claudius, censor, 310 B. C.* An episode which illustrates the\r\ngrowing democratic tendencies of the time is the censorship of Appius\r\nClaudius, in 310, whose office is memorable for the construction of the\r\nVia Appia and the Aqua Appia, Rome’s first aqueduct. In his revision of\r\nthe Senate, Appius ventured to include among the senators persons who were\r\nthe sons of freedmen, and he permitted the landless population of the city\r\nto enroll themselves in whatever tribal district they pleased. This latter\r\nstep was taken to increase the power of the city plebs, who had previously\r\nbeen confined to the four city tribes, but who might now spread their\r\nvotes over the rural districts, of which there were now twenty-seven.\r\nHowever, the work of Appius was soon undone. The consuls refused to\r\nrecognize the senatorial list prepared by him and his colleague, and the\r\nfollowing censors again restricted the city plebs to the urban tribes.\r\n\r\n*The plebs and the priesthood.* The last stronghold of patrician privilege\r\nwas the priesthood which was opened to the plebeians by the Ogulnian Law\r\nof 300 B. C. The number of pontiffs and augurs was increased and the new\r\npositions were filled by plebeians. The patricians could no longer make\r\nuse of religious law and practice to hamper the political activity of the\r\nplebs.\r\n\r\n*The Hortensian **Law**, 287 B. C.* The end of the struggle between the\r\norders came with the secession of 287 B. C. Apparently this crisis was\r\nproduced by the demands of the farming population who had become heavily\r\nburdened with debt as a result of the economic strain put upon them by the\r\nlong Samnite wars. Refusal to meet their demands led to a schism, and the\r\nplebeian soldiers under arms seceded to the Janiculum. A dictator, Quintus\r\nHortensius, appointed for the purpose, settled the differences and passed\r\na _lex Hortensia_, which provided that for the future all measures passed\r\nin the _comitia tributa_, even without the previous approval of the\r\nSenate, should become binding on the whole state. Thus the Assembly of the\r\nTribes as a legislative body acquired greater independence than the\r\nAssembly of the Centuries.\r\n\r\n*The two assemblies of the people.* Henceforth, the Assembly of the Tribes\r\ntended to become more and more the legislative assembly _par excellence_,\r\nwhile the Assembly of the Centuries remained the chief elective assembly.\r\nFor legislative purposes the Assembly of the Tribes could be convened by a\r\nmagistrate with _imperium_ or by a tribune; for the election of the\r\nplebeian tribunes and aediles it had to be summoned by a tribune; while to\r\nelect the quaestors and curule aediles it must be called together by a\r\nmagistrate. For all purposes the Assembly of the Centuries had to be\r\nconvened and presided over by a magistrate. It elected the consuls,\r\npraetors, censors and, eventually, twenty-four military tribunes for the\r\nannual levy. It must be kept in mind that these were both primary\r\nassemblies, that each comprised the whole body of Roman citizens, but that\r\nthey differed essentially in the organization of the voting groups. As we\r\nhave seen the wealthier classes dominated the Assembly of the Centuries,\r\nbut in the Assembly of the Tribes, which was the more democratic body, a\r\nsimple majority determined the vote of each tribe.\r\n\r\n*The increased importance of the tribunate.* The importance of the\r\ntribunes was greatly enhanced by the Hortensian Law, as well as by various\r\nprivileges which they had already acquired by 287 or gained shortly after\r\nthat date. The more important of these powers were the right to sit in the\r\nSenate, to address, and even to convene that body, and the right to\r\nprosecute any magistrate before the _comitia tributa_. The first of these\r\npowers was a development of the tribunician veto, whereby this was given\r\nto a proposal under discussion in the Senate rather than upon a\r\nmagistrate’s attempt to execute it after it had taken the form of a law or\r\na senatorial decree. To permit the tribunes to interpose their veto at\r\nthis stage they had to be allowed to hear the debates in the Senate. At\r\nfirst they did so from their bench which they set at the door of the\r\nmeeting-place, but finally they were permitted to enter the council hall\r\nitself. The power of prosecution made the tribunes the guardians of the\r\ninterests of the state against any misconduct on the part of a magistrate.\r\nFrom this time on the tribunes have practically the status of magistrates\r\nof the Roman people.\r\n\r\nThe struggle of the orders left its mark on the Roman constitution in\r\nproviding Rome with a double set of organs of government. The tribunate,\r\nplebeian aedileship, and _comitia tributa_ arose as purely plebeian\r\ninstitutions, but they came to be incorporated in the governmental\r\norganization of the state along with the magistracies and the assemblies\r\nthat had always been institutions of the whole Roman people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      IV. THE ROMAN MILITARY SYSTEM\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon the history of no people has the character of its military\r\ninstitutions exercised a more profound effect than upon that of Rome. The\r\nRoman military system rested upon the universal obligation of the male\r\ncitizens to render military service, but the degree to which this\r\nobligation was enforced varied greatly at different periods. For the\r\nmobilization of the man power of the state was dependent upon the type of\r\nequipment, methods of fighting, and organization of tactical units in\r\nvogue at various times, as well as upon the ability of the state to equip\r\nits troops and the strength of the martial spirit of the people.\r\n\r\n*The army of the primitive state.* In all probability the earliest Roman\r\narmy was one of the Homeric type, where the nobles who went to the\r\nbattlefield on horseback or in chariots were the decisive factor and the\r\ncommon folk counted for little.\r\n\r\n*The phalanx organization.* However, at an early date, under Etruscan\r\ninfluences according to tradition, the Romans adopted the phalanx\r\norganization, making their tactical unit the long deep line of infantry\r\narmed with lance and shield. Those who were able to provide themselves\r\nwith the armor necessary for taking their place in the phalanx formed the\r\n_classis_ or “levy.” The rest were said to be _infra classem_, and were\r\nonly called upon to act as light troops. But military necessities\r\ncompelled the state to incorporate with the heavy-armed infantry\r\nincreasingly large contingents of the less wealthy citizens, who could not\r\nprovide themselves with the full equipment of those in the _classis_, but\r\nwho could form the rear ranks of the phalanx. As a result of this step the\r\ncitizens were ultimately divided into five orders or classes on the basis\r\nof their property, and probably in raising the levy the required number of\r\nsoldiers of each class was drafted in equal proportions from the several\r\ntribes. The first three classes constituted the phalanx, while the fourth\r\nand fifth continued to serve as light troops (_rorarii_). Those who lacked\r\nthe property qualification of the lowest class were only called into\r\nservice in cases of great emergency. For such a system the taking of an\r\naccurate census was essential, and it is more than likely that the office\r\nof censor was instituted for this purpose. As we have seen, it was from\r\nthis organization of the people for military purposes that there developed\r\nthe Assembly of the Centuries.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of pay for the troops in the field at the time of the\r\nsiege of Veii both lessened the economic burden which service entailed\r\nupon the poorer soldiers and enabled the Romans to undertake campaigns of\r\nlonger duration, even such as involved winter operations.\r\n\r\n*The manipular legion.* How long the phalanx organization was maintained\r\nwe do not know: at any rate it did not survive the Samnite wars. In its\r\nplace appeared the legionary formation, in which the largest unit was the\r\nlegion of about four thousand infantry, divided into maniples of one\r\nhundred and twenty (or sixty) men, each capable of manœuvering\r\nindependently. This arrangement admitted of increased flexibility of\r\nmovement in broken country, and of the adoption of the _pilum_, or\r\njavelin, as a missile weapon. Both the _pilum_ and the _scutum_, or oblong\r\nshield, were of Samnite origin. While reorganizing their infantry, the\r\nRomans strengthened the _equites_ and developed them as a real cavalry\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nApparently property qualifications no longer counted for much in the army\r\norganization, as the men were assigned to their places in the ranks on the\r\nbasis of age and experience, and the state furnished the necessary weapons\r\nto those who did not provide their own. By the third century, all\r\nable-bodied men holding property valued at 4000 asses were regularly\r\ncalled upon for military service. The others were liable to naval service,\r\nbut only in cases of great need were they enrolled in the legions.\r\nOrdinarily, the service required amounted to sixteen campaigns in the\r\ninfantry and ten in the cavalry. The field army was raised from those\r\nbetween seventeen and forty-six years of age: those forty-six and over\r\nwere liable only for garrison duty in the city. The regular annual levy\r\nconsisted of four legions, besides 1800 cavalry. This number could be\r\nincreased at need, and the Roman forces in the field were supplemented by\r\nat least an equal number in the contingents from the Italian allies.\r\n\r\nThe Roman army was thus a national levy: a militia. It was commanded by\r\nthe consuls, the annually elected presidents of the state. Yet it avoided\r\nthe characteristic weaknesses of militia troops, for the frequency of the\r\nRoman wars and the length of the period of liability for service assured\r\nthe presence of a large quota of veterans in each levy and maintained a\r\nhigh standard of military efficiency. Furthermore, the consuls, if not\r\nalways good generals, were generally experienced soldiers, for a record of\r\nten campaigns was required of the candidate for public office. Likewise\r\ntheir subordinates, the military tribunes, were veterans, having seen some\r\nfive and others ten years’ service. But the factor that contributed above\r\nall else to the success of the Roman armies was their iron discipline. The\r\nconsular _imperium_ gave its holder absolute power over the lives of the\r\nsoldiers in the field, and death was the penalty for neglect of duty,\r\ndisobedience, or cowardice. The most striking proof of the discipline of\r\nthe Roman armies is that after every march they were required to construct\r\na fortified camp, laid out according to fixed rules and protected by a\r\nditch, a wall of earth, and a palisade for which they carried the stakes.\r\nNo matter how strenuous their labors had been, they never neglected this\r\ntask, in striking contrast to the Greek citizen armies which could not be\r\ninduced to construct works of this kind. The fortified camp rendered the\r\nRomans safe from surprise attacks, allowed them to choose their own time\r\nfor joining battle, and gave them a secure refuge after a defeat. It\r\nplayed a very large part in the operations of the Roman armies, especially\r\nsuch as were conducted in hostile territory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\n                        EARLY RELIGION AND SOCIETY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         I. EARLY ROMAN RELIGION\r\n\r\n\r\n*Animism.* The Roman religion of the historic republic was a composite of\r\nbeliefs and ceremonies of various origins. The basic stratum of this\r\nsystem was the Roman element: religious ideas that the Romans probably\r\nheld in common with the other Latin and Italian peoples. Although traces\r\nof a belief in magic; and of the worship of natural objects and animals,\r\nsurvived from earlier stages of religious development, it was “animism”\r\nthat formed the basis of what we may call the characteristic Roman\r\nreligious ideas. Animism is the belief that natural objects are the abode\r\nof spirits more powerful than man, and that all natural forces and\r\nprocesses are the expression of the activity of similar spirits. When such\r\npowers or _numina_ were conceived as personalities with definite names\r\nthey became ‘gods,’ _dei_. And because the primitive Roman gods were the\r\nspirits of an earlier age, for a long time the Romans worshipped them\r\nwithout images or temples. But each divinity was regarded as residing in a\r\ncertain locality and only there could his worship be conducted. The true\r\nRoman gods lacked human attributes: their power was admitted but they\r\ninspired no personal devotion. Consequently, Roman theology consisted in\r\nthe knowledge of these deities and their powers and of the ceremonial acts\r\nnecessary to influence them.\r\n\r\n*The importance of ritual.* The Romans, while recognizing their dependence\r\nupon divine powers, considered that their relation to them was of the\r\nnature of a contract. If man observed all proper ritual in his worship,\r\nthe god was bound to act propitiously: if the god granted man’s desire he\r\nmust be rewarded with an offering. If man failed in his duty, the god\r\npunished him: if the god refused to hearken, man was not bound to continue\r\nhis worship. Thus Roman religion consisted essentially in the performance\r\nof ritual, wherein the correctness of the performance was the chief\r\nfactor.\r\n\r\nBut since the power of the gods could affect the community as well as the\r\nindividual, it was necessary for the state to observe with the same\r\nscrupulous care as the latter its obligations towards them. The knowledge\r\nof these obligations and how they were to be performed constituted the\r\nsacred law of Rome, which became a very important part of the public law.\r\nThis sacred law was guarded by the priesthood, and here we have the source\r\nof the power of the pontiffs in the Roman state. The pontiffs not only\r\npreserved the sacred traditions and customs but they also added to them by\r\ninterpretation and the establishment of new precedents. The pontiffs\r\nthemselves performed or supervised the performance of all public acts of a\r\npurely religious nature, and likewise prescribed the ritual to be observed\r\nby the magistrate in initiating public acts.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand the power of the augurs rested upon the belief that the\r\ngods issued their warnings to men through natural signs, and that it was\r\npossible to discover the attitude of the gods towards any contemplated\r\nhuman action by the observation of natural phenomena. For the augurs were\r\nthe guardians of the science of the interpretation of such signs or\r\nauspices in so far as the state was concerned. The magistrate initiating\r\nany important public act had to take the auspices, and if the augurs\r\ndeclared any flaw therein or held that any unfavorable omen had occurred\r\nduring the performance of the said act, they could suspend the\r\nmagistrate’s action or render it invalid.\r\n\r\nSo we see that the Roman priests were not intermediaries between the\r\nindividual Roman and his gods, but rather, as has been pointed out before,\r\nofficers in charge of one branch of the public administration. They were\r\nresponsible for the due observance of the public religious acts, just as\r\nthe head of the household supervised the performance of the family cult.\r\n\r\n*The cult of the household.* It is in the cult of the household that we\r\ncan best see the true Roman religious ideas. The chief divinities of the\r\nhousehold were: Janus, the spirit of the doorway; Vesta, the spirit of the\r\nfire on the hearth; the Penates, the guardian spirits of the\r\nstore-chamber; the Lar Familiaris, which we may perhaps regard as the\r\nspirit of the cultivated land; and the Genius of the head of the house,\r\noriginally, it is probable, the spirit of his generative powers, which\r\nbecame symbolic of the life of the family as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe Romans, strictly speaking, did not practice ancestor-worship. But they\r\nbelieved that the spirits of the departed were affected by the\r\nministrations of the living, and, in case these were omitted, might\r\nexercise a baneful influence upon the fortunes of their descendants. Hence\r\ncame the obligation to remember the dead with offerings at stated times in\r\nthe year.\r\n\r\n*The cult of the fields.* As early Rome was essentially an agricultural\r\ncommunity, most of its divinities and festivals had to do with the various\r\nphases of agricultural life. Festivals of the sowing, the harvest, the\r\nvineyard and the like, were annually celebrated in common, at fixed\r\nseasons, by the households of the various _pagi_.\r\n\r\n*The state cult.* The public or state cult of Rome consisted mainly in the\r\nperformance of certain of the rites of the household and of the _pagi_ by\r\nor for the people as a whole. The state cult of Vesta and of the Penates,\r\nas well as the festival of the Ambarvalia, the annual solemn purification\r\nof the fields, are of this nature. But, in addition, the state religion\r\nincluded the worship of certain divinities whose personalities and powers\r\nwere conceived with greater distinctness. At the beginning of the Republic\r\nthe chief of these gods were the triad Juppiter, Juno, and Minerva.\r\nJuppiter Optimus Maximus, called also Capitolinus from his place of\r\nworship, was originally a god of the sky. But, adorned with various other\r\nattributes, he was finally worshipped as the chief protecting divinity of\r\nthe Roman State. Juno was the female counterpart of Juppiter and was the\r\ngreat patron goddess of women. Another important deity was Mars, at one\r\ntime an agricultural divinity, who in the state religion developed into\r\nthe god of warlike, “martial,” activities.\r\n\r\n*Foreign influences.* It was in connection with the state worship that\r\nforeign influences were first felt. Indeed, it is probable that the\r\nassociation of Juppiter with Juno and Minerva was due to contact with\r\nEtruria. It was from the Etruscans also that the Romans derived their\r\nknowledge of temple construction, the earliest example of which was\r\nprobably the temple of Juppiter on the Capitoline said to have been\r\ndedicated in 508 B. C. The use of images was likewise due to Etruscan\r\ninfluences, although here as in other respects Greek ideas may have been\r\nat work. In general the Romans did not regard the gods of strange people\r\nwith hostility, but rather admitted their power and sought to conciliate\r\nthem. Thus they frequently transferred to Rome the gods of states that\r\nthey had conquered or absorbed. Other foreign divinities, too, on various\r\ngrounds were added to the circle of the divine protectors of the Roman\r\nstate.\r\n\r\n*Religion and morality.* From the foregoing sketch it will be seen that\r\nthe Roman religion did not have profound moral and elevating influences.\r\nIts hold upon the Roman people was chiefly due to the fact that it\r\nsymbolized the unity of the various groups whose members participated in\r\nthe same worship; i. e. the unity of the family and the unity of the\r\nstate. Nevertheless, the idea of obligation inherent in the Roman\r\nconception of the relation between gods and men and the stress laid upon\r\nthe exact performance of ritual inevitably developed among the Romans a\r\nstrong sense of duty, a moral factor of considerable value. Further, the\r\npower of precedent and tradition in their religion helped to develop and\r\nstrengthen the conservatism so characteristic of the Roman people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         II. EARLY ROMAN SOCIETY\r\n\r\n\r\n*The household.* The cornerstone of the Roman social structure was the\r\nhousehold (_familia_). That is to say, the state was an association of\r\nhouseholds, and it was the individual’s position in a household that\r\ndetermined his status in the early community. The Roman household was a\r\nlarger unit than our family. It comprised the father or head of the\r\nhousehold (_pater familias_), his wife, his sons with their wives and\r\nchildren, if they had such, his unmarried daughters, and the household\r\nslaves.\r\n\r\n*The patria potestas.* The _pater familias_ possessed authority over all\r\nother members of the household. His power over the free members was called\r\n_patria potestas_, “paternal authority”; over the slaves it was\r\n_dominium_, “lordship.” This paternal authority was in theory unrestricted\r\nand gave the father the right to inflict the death penalty upon those\r\nunder his power. But, in practice, the exercise of the _patria potestas_\r\nwas limited by custom and by the habit of consulting the older male\r\nmembers of the household before any important action was taken.\r\n\r\nThe household estate (_res familiaris_) was administered by the head of\r\nthe household. At the death of a _pater familias_ his sons in turn became\r\nthe head of _familiae_, dividing the estate. The mother and unmarried\r\ndaughters, if surviving, now passed into the power of a son or the next\r\nnearest male relative of the deceased. Although the Roman women were thus\r\ncontinually in the position of wards, they nevertheless took a prominent\r\npart in the life of the household and did not live the restricted and\r\nsecluded lives of the women of Athens and the Greek cities of Asia.\r\n\r\nMembership in the household was reckoned only through male descent, for\r\ndaughters when they married passed out of the _manus_ or “power” of the\r\nhead of their own household into that of the head of the household to\r\nwhich their husbands belonged.\r\n\r\n*Education.* The training of the Roman youth at this time was mainly of a\r\npractical nature. There was as yet little interest in intellectual\r\npursuits and no Roman literature had been developed. The art of writing,\r\nit is true, had long been known and was employed in the keeping of records\r\nand accounts. Such instruction as there was, was given by the father to\r\nhis sons. It consisted probably of athletic exercises, of practical\r\ntraining in agricultural pursuits, in the traditions of the state and of\r\nthe Roman heroes, and in the conduct of public business through attendance\r\nat places where this was transacted.\r\n\r\nAt the age of eighteen the young Roman entered upon a new footing in\r\nrelation to the state. He was now liable to military service and qualified\r\nto attend the _comitia_. In these respects he was emancipated from the\r\npaternal authority. If he attained a magistracy, his father obeyed him\r\nlike any other citizen.\r\n\r\nThe discipline and respect for authority which was acquired in the family\r\nlife was carried with him by the Roman into his public relations, and this\r\nsense of duty was perhaps the strongest quality in the Roman character. It\r\nwas supplemented by the characteristic Roman seriousness (_gravitas_),\r\ndeveloped under the stress of the long struggles for existence waged by\r\nthe early Roman state. In the Roman the highest virtue was piety\r\n(_pietas_), which meant the dutiful performance of all one’s obligations,\r\nto the gods, to one’s kinsmen, and to the state. The Romans were\r\npreëminently a practical people, and their practical virtues laid the\r\nfoundation for their political greatness.\r\n\r\n*The mos maiorum.* We have already referred to the conservatism of the\r\nRomans, and have seen how this characteristic was affected by their\r\nreligious beliefs. It was further strengthened by the respect paid to\r\nparental authority and by the absence of intellectual training. In public\r\naffairs this conservatism was shown by the influence of ancestral\r\ncustom—the _mos maiorum_. In the Roman government this became a very\r\npotent factor, since the Roman constitution was not a single comprehensive\r\ndocument but consisted of a number of separate enactments supplemented by\r\ncustom and precedent and interpreted in the light thereof.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\n ROMAN DOMINATION IN THE MEDITERRANEAN; THE FIRST PHASE—THE STRUGGLE WITH\r\n                         CARTHAGE; 265–201 B. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 I. THE MEDITERRANEAN WORLD IN 265 B. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Rome a world power.* With the unification of the Italian peninsula Rome\r\nentered upon a new era in her foreign relations. She was now one of the\r\ngreat powers of the Mediterranean world and was inevitably drawn into the\r\nvortex of world politics. She could no longer rest indifferent to what\r\nwent on beyond the confines of Italy. She assumed new responsibilities,\r\nopened up new diplomatic relations, developed a new outlook and new\r\nambitions. At this time the other first-class powers were, in the east,\r\nthe three Hellenistic monarchies—Egypt, Syria, and Macedon,—which had\r\nemerged from the ruins of the empire of Alexander the Great, and, in the\r\nwest, the city state of Carthage.\r\n\r\n*Egypt.* The kingdom of Egypt, ruled by the dynasty of the Ptolemies,\r\ncomprised the ancient kingdom of Egypt in the Nile valley, Cyrene, the\r\ncoast of Syria, Cyprus, and a number of cities on the shores and islands\r\nof the Aegean Sea. In Egypt the Ptolemies ruled as foreigners over the\r\nsubject native population. They maintained their authority by a small\r\nmercenary army recruited chiefly from Macedonians and Greeks, and by a\r\nstrongly centralized administration, of which the offices were in Greek\r\nhands. As the ruler was the sole proprietor of the land of Egypt, the\r\nnative Egyptians, the majority of whom were peasants who gained their\r\nlivelihood by tilling the rich soil of the Nile valley, were for the most\r\npart tenants of the crown, and the restrictions and obligations to which\r\nthey were subject rendered their status little better than that of serfs.\r\nA highly developed but oppressive system of taxation and government\r\nmonopolies, largely an inheritance from previous dynasties, enabled the\r\nPtolemies to wring from their subjects the revenues with which they\r\nmaintained a brilliant court life at their capital, Alexandria, and\r\nfinanced their imperial policy.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: The Expansion of Rome in the Mediterranean World 265–44\r\n  B. C.]\r\n\r\nThe aim of this policy was to secure Egyptian domination in the Aegean,\r\namong the states of Southern Greece, and in Phoenicia, whose value lay in\r\nthe forests of the Lebanon mountains. To carry it into effect the\r\nPtolemies were obliged to support a navy which would give them the command\r\nof the sea in the eastern Mediterranean. However, the occupation of their\r\noutlying possessions brought Egypt into perpetual conflict with Macedon\r\nand Syria, whose rulers made continued efforts to oust the Ptolemies from\r\nthe Aegean and from the Syrian coast.\r\n\r\n*Syria.* Syria, the kingdom of the Seleucids, with its capital at Antioch\r\non the Orontes, was by far the largest of the Hellenistic monarchies in\r\nextent and population, and in wealth it ranked next to Egypt. It stretched\r\nfrom the Aegean to the borders of India, and included the southern part of\r\nAsia Minor, Mesopotamia, Persia, and northern Syria. But the very size of\r\nthis kingdom was a source of weakness, because of the distances which\r\nseparated its various provinces and the heterogeneous racial elements\r\nwhich it embraced. The power of the dynasty was upheld, as in Egypt, by a\r\nmercenary army, and also by the Greek cities which had been founded in\r\nlarge numbers by Alexander the Great and his successors. However, these\r\nislands of Greek culture did not succeed to any great extent in\r\nHellenizing the native populations which remained in a state of\r\nsubjection, indifferent or hostile to their conquerors. Furthermore the\r\nstrength of the Seleucid empire was sapped by repeated revolts in its\r\neastern provinces and dissensions between the members of the dynasty\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n*Macedon.* The kingdom of Macedon, ruled by the house of the Antigonids,\r\nwas the smallest of the three in extent, population and resources, but\r\npossessed an internal strength and solidarity lacking in the others. For\r\nin Macedon, the Antigonids, by preserving the traditional character of the\r\npatriarchal monarchy, kept alive the national spirit of the Macedonians\r\nand made them loyal to the dynasty. They also retained a military system\r\nwhich fostered the traditions of the times of Philip II and Alexander, and\r\nwhich, since the Macedonian people had not lost its martial character,\r\nfurnished a small but efficient national army. Outside of Macedon, the\r\nAntigonids held sway over Thessaly and the eastern part of Greece as far\r\nsouth as the Isthmus of Corinth. Their attempts to dominate the whole\r\npeninsula were thwarted by the opposition of the Aetolian and Achaian\r\nConfederacies, who were supported in this by the Ptolemies.\r\n\r\n*The minor Greek states.* In addition to these three great monarchies we\r\nshould note as powers of minor importance the Confederacies mentioned\r\nbefore, the kingdom of Pergamon on the northwest coast of Asia Minor, the\r\nisland republic of Rhodes, which was a naval power of considerable\r\nstrength, and the kingdom of Syracuse in Sicily, the last of the\r\nindependent Greek cities on that island.\r\n\r\n*Carthage.* The fourth world power was Carthage, a city state situated on\r\nthe northern coast of Africa, opposite the western end of the island of\r\nSicily, which had created for itself an empire that controlled the western\r\nhalf of the Mediterranean. Carthage was founded as a colony of the\r\nPhoenician city of Tyre about 814 B. C. In the sixth century, with the\r\npassing of the cities of Phoenicia under the domination, first of Babylon,\r\nand later of the Persian Empire, their colonies in the western\r\nMediterranean severed political ties with their mother land and had\r\nhenceforth to maintain themselves by their own efforts.\r\n\r\n*The Carthaginian Empire.* Their weakness was the opportunity of Carthage,\r\nwhich, in the sixth and following centuries, brought under her control the\r\nother Phoenician settlements, in addition to founding new colonies of her\r\nown. She also extended her sway over the native Libyan population in the\r\nvicinity of Carthage. These Libyans were henceforth tributary and under\r\nthe obligation of rendering military service to the Carthaginians: similar\r\nobligations rested upon the dependent Phoenician allies. In the third\r\ncentury the Carthaginian empire included the northern coast of Africa from\r\nthe Gulf of Syrtis westwards beyond the Straits of Gibraltar, the southern\r\nand eastern coasts of Spain as far north as Cape Nao, Corsica, Sardinia,\r\nand Sicily, with the exception of Messana in the extreme northeast and the\r\nKingdom of Syracuse in the southeastern part of the island. The smaller\r\nislands of the western Mediterranean were likewise under Carthaginian\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\n*The government of Carthage.* At this time the government of Carthage\r\nitself was republican in form and strongly aristocratic in tone. There was\r\na primary Assembly for all Carthaginian citizens who could satisfy certain\r\nage and property requirements. This body annually elected the two chief\r\nmagistrates or suffetes, and likewise the generals. For the former\r\nqualifications of wealth and merit were prescribed. There was also a\r\nSenate, and a Council, whose organization and powers are uncertain. The\r\nCouncil, the smaller body, prepared the matters to be discussed in the\r\nSenate, which was consulted by the Suffetes on all matters and usually\r\ngave the final decision, although the Assembly was supposed to be\r\nconsulted in case the Senate and Suffetes disagreed. The Suffetes\r\nexercised judicial, financial and religious functions, and presided over\r\nthe council and senate. The Carthaginian aristocracy, like that of Venice,\r\nwas a group of wealthy families whose fortunes, made in commercial\r\nventures, were handed down for generations in the same houses. From this\r\ncircle came the members of the council and senate, who directed the policy\r\nof the state. The aristocracy itself was split into factions, struggling\r\nto control the offices and through them the public policy, which they\r\nfrequently subordinated to their own particular interests.\r\n\r\n*The commercial policy of Carthage.* The prosperity of Carthage depended\r\nupon her empire and the maintenance of a commercial monopoly in the\r\nwestern Mediterranean. This policy of commercial exclusiveness had caused\r\nCarthage to oppose Greek colonial expansion in Spain, Sardinia and Sicily,\r\nand had led to treaties which placed definite limits upon the trading\r\nventures of the Romans and their allies, and of the Greeks from Massalia\r\nand her colonies in France and northern Spain.\r\n\r\n*Carthaginian naval and **military** strength.* Such a policy could only\r\nbe maintained by a strong naval power, and, in fact, Carthage was the\r\nundisputed mistress of the seas west of the straits of Messana. Unlike\r\nRome, however, Carthage had no organized national army but relied upon an\r\narmy of mercenaries recruited from all quarters of the Mediterranean,\r\namong such warlike peoples as the Gauls, Spaniards, Libyans and Greeks.\r\nAlthough brave and skillful fighters, these, like all troops of the type,\r\nwere liable to become dispirited and mutinous under continued reverses or\r\nwhen faced by shortage of pay and plunder.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state with which Rome was now brought face to face by the\r\nconquest of South Italy and which was the first power she was to challenge\r\nin a war for dominion beyond the peninsula. As we have seen, Rome had long\r\nere this come into contact with this great maritime people.(4) Two\r\ntreaties, one perhaps dating from the close of the sixth century, and the\r\nother from 348 B. C., regulated commercial intercourse between the two\r\nstates and their respective subjects and allies. A third, concluded in\r\n279, had provided for military coöperation against Pyrrhus, but this\r\nalliance had ceased after the defeat of the latter, and with the removal\r\nof this common enemy a feeling of coolness or mutual suspicion seems to\r\nhave arisen between the erstwhile allies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  II. THE FIRST PUNIC WAR: 264–241 B. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n*The origins of the war.* The first war between Rome and Carthage arose\r\nout of the political situation in the island of Sicily. There the town of\r\nMessana was occupied by the Mamertini, a band of Campanian mercenaries,\r\nwho had been in the service of Syracuse but who had deserted and seized\r\nthis town about 284 B. C. Because of their perpetual acts of brigandage\r\nthey were a menace to their neighbors, the Syracusans. The latter, now\r\nunder an energetic ruler, Hiero, who had assumed the title of king, in 265\r\nsucceeded in blockading Messana and its ultimate capture seemed certain.\r\nIn despair the Mamertini sought help from the Carthaginians who sent a\r\ngarrison to Messana, for they looked with jealousy upon any extension of\r\nSyracusan territory. However, the majority of the Mamertini sought to be\r\ntaken under the protection of Rome and appealed to the Roman Senate for\r\naid. The senators on the one hand saw that to espouse the cause of the\r\nMamertini would be to provoke a war with Carthage, an eventuality before\r\nwhich they shrank, but on the other hand they recognized that the\r\nCarthaginian occupation of Messana would give them the control of the\r\nStraits of Messana and constitute a perpetual threat against southern\r\nItaly. The strength of these conflicting considerations made them\r\nunwilling to assume responsibility for a decision and they referred the\r\nmatter to the Assembly of the Centuries. Here the people, elated,\r\napparently, by their recent victorious wars in Italy, and led on by hopes\r\nof pecuniary advantage to be derived from the war, decided to admit the\r\nMamertini to the Roman alliance. One consul, Appius Claudius, was sent\r\nwith a small force to relieve the town (264).\r\n\r\nThe Mamertini induced the Carthaginian garrison to withdraw, and then\r\nadmitted the Roman force which crossed the straits with the aid of vessels\r\nfurnished by their Greek allies in Italy. Thereupon the Carthaginians made\r\nan alliance with the Syracusans, but the Romans defeated each of them.\r\n\r\n*Alliance of Rome and Syracuse.* In the next year the Romans sent a larger\r\narmy into Sicily to attack Syracuse and met with such success that Hiero\r\nbecame alarmed, and, making peace upon easy terms, concluded an alliance\r\nwith them for fifteen years.(5) Aided by Hiero the Romans now began an\r\nattack upon Agrigentum, the Carthaginian stronghold which threatened\r\nSyracuse. When this was taken in 262, they determined to drive the\r\nCarthaginians from the whole island.\r\n\r\n*Rome builds a fleet.* However, Roman operations in Sicily could only be\r\nconducted at considerable risk and the coasts of Italy remained exposed to\r\ncontinued raids as long as Carthage had undisputed control of the sea.\r\nConsequently the Romans decided to build a fleet that would put an end to\r\nthe Carthaginian naval supremacy. They constructed 120 vessels, of which\r\n100 were of the type called quinquiremes, the regular first class\r\nbattleships of the day. The complement of each was three hundred rowers\r\nand one hundred and twenty fighting men.(6) With this armament, and some\r\nvessels from the Roman allies, the consul, Gaius Duilius, put to sea in\r\n260 B. C. and won a decisive battle off Mylae on the north coast of\r\nSicily. As a result of this battle in the next year the Romans were able\r\nto occupy Corsica and attack Sardinia, and finding it impossible to force\r\na decision in Sicily, they were in a position to attack Carthage in Africa\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n*The Roman invasion of Africa, 256 B. C.* Another naval victory, off\r\nEcnomus, on the south coast of Sicily, cleared the way for the successful\r\nlanding of an army under the consul Marcus Atilius Regulus. He defeated\r\nthe Carthaginians in battle and reduced them to such extremities that they\r\nsought to make peace. But the terms which Atilius proposed were so harsh\r\nthat in desperation they resumed hostilities. At this juncture there\r\narrived at Carthage, with other mercenaries, a Spartan soldier of fortune,\r\nXantippus, who reorganized the Carthaginian army. By the skilful use of\r\ncavalry and war elephants he inflicted a crushing defeat upon the Romans\r\nand took Atilius prisoner. A Roman fleet rescued the remnants of the\r\nexpedition, but was almost totally lost in a storm off the southern\r\nSicilian coast (255).\r\n\r\n*The war in Sicily, 254–241 B. C.* The Romans again concentrated their\r\nefforts against the Carthaginian strongholds in Sicily, which they\r\nattacked from land and sea. In 254 they took the important city of\r\nPanormus, and the Carthaginians were soon confined to the western\r\nextremity of the island. There, however, they successfully maintained\r\nthemselves in Drepana and Lilybaeum. Meantime the Romans encountered a\r\nseries of disasters on the sea. In 253 they lost a number of ships on the\r\nvoyage from Lilybaeum to Rome, in 250 the consul Publius Clodius suffered\r\na severe defeat in a naval battle at Drepana, and in the next year a third\r\nfleet was destroyed by a storm off Phintias in Sicily.\r\n\r\nIn 247 a new Carthaginian general, Hamilcar Barca, took command in Sicily\r\nand infused new life into the Carthaginian forces. From the citadel of\r\nHercte first, and later from Eryx, he continually harassed the Romans not\r\nonly in Sicily but even on the coast of Italy. Finally, in 242 B. C., when\r\ntheir public treasury was too exhausted to build another fleet, the Romans\r\nby private subscription equipped 200 vessels, which undertook the blockade\r\nof Lilybaeum and Drepana. A Carthaginian relief expedition was destroyed\r\noff the Aegates Islands, and it was impossible for their forces, now\r\ncompletely cut off in Sicily, to prolong the struggle. Carthage was\r\ncompelled to conclude peace in 241 B. C.\r\n\r\n*The terms of peace.* Carthage surrendered to Rome her remaining\r\npossessions in Sicily, with the islands between Sicily and Italy, besides\r\nagreeing to pay an indemnity of 3200 talents (about $3,500,000) in twenty\r\nyears. For the Romans the long struggle had been very costly. At sea alone\r\nthey had lost in the neighborhood of 500 ships and 200,000 men. But again\r\nthe Roman military system had proven its worth against a mercenary army,\r\nand the excellence of the Roman soldiery had more than compensated for the\r\nweakness in the custom of annually changing commanders. Moreover, the\r\nmilitary federation which Rome had created in Italy had stood the test of\r\na long and weary war, without any disloyalty being manifest among her\r\nallies. On the other hand, the losses of Carthage had been even more\r\nheavy, and, most serious of all, her sea power was broken and Rome\r\ncontrolled the western Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n*The revolt of the Carthaginian mercenaries.* Weakened as she was after\r\nthe contest with Rome, Carthage became immediately thereafter involved in\r\na life and death struggle with her mercenary troops. These, upon their\r\nreturn from Sicily, made demands upon the state which the latter found\r\nhard to meet and consequently refused. Thereupon the mercenaries mutinied\r\nand, joining with the native Libyans and the inhabitants of the subject\r\nPhoenician cities (Libyphoenicians), entered upon a war for the\r\ndestruction of Carthage. After a struggle of more than three years, in\r\nwhich the most shocking barbarities were practised on either side and in\r\nwhich they were brought face to face with utter ruin, the Carthaginians\r\nunder the leadership of Hamilcar Barca stamped out the revolt (238 B. C.).\r\n\r\n*Rome acquires Sardinia.* Up to this point Rome had looked on without\r\ninterference, but now, when Carthage sought to recover Sardinia from the\r\nmutinous garrison there, she declared war. Carthage could not think of\r\naccepting the challenge and bought peace at the price of Sardinia and\r\nCorsica and 1200 talents ($1,500,000). This unjustifiable act of the\r\nRomans rankled sore in the memories of the Carthaginians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             III. THE ILLYRIAN AND GALLIC WARS: 229–219 B. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n*The first Illyrian war: 229–228 B. C.* In assuming control of the\r\nrelations of her allies with foreign states, Rome had assumed\r\nresponsibility for protecting their interests, and it was the fulfillment\r\nof this obligation which brought the Roman arms to the eastern shores of\r\nthe Adriatic.\r\n\r\nUnder a king named Agron an extensive but loosely organized state had been\r\nformed among the Illyrians, a semibarbarous people inhabiting the Adriatic\r\ncoast to the north of Epirus. These Illyrians were allied with the kingdom\r\nof Macedonia and sided with the latter in its wars with Epirus and the\r\nAetolian and Achaean Confederacies. In 231 Agron died and was succeeded by\r\nhis queen Teuta, who continued his policy of attacking the cities on the\r\nwest coast of Greece and practising piracy on a large scale in the\r\nAdriatic and Ionian seas. Among those who suffered thereby were the south\r\nItalian cities, which in 230 B. C. as the result of fresh and more serious\r\noutrages appealed to Rome for redress. Thereupon the Romans demanded\r\nsatisfaction from Teuta and, upon their demands being contemptuously\r\nrejected, they declared war.\r\n\r\n*The Romans cross the Adriatic: 229 B. C.* In the next spring, 229 B. C.,\r\nthe Romans sent against the Illyrians a fleet and an army of such strength\r\nthat the latter could offer but little resistance and in the next year\r\nwere forced to sue for peace. Teuta had to give up a large part of her\r\nterritory, to bind herself not to send a fleet into the Ionian sea, and to\r\npay tribute to Rome. Corcyra, Epidamnus, Apollonia, and other cities\r\nbecame Roman allies.\r\n\r\nThe fact that Rome first crossed the Adriatic to prosecute a war against\r\nthe Illyrians placed her in hostility to their ally, Macedonia, the\r\ngreatest of the Greek states. And although Macedonia had been unable to\r\noffer aid to the Illyrians because of dynastic troubles that had followed\r\nthe death of King Demetrius (229 B. C.), the Macedonians regarded with\r\njealous suspicion Rome’s success and the establishment of a Roman sphere\r\nof influence east of the Adriatic. Conversely, the war had established\r\nfriendly relations and coöperation between Rome and the foes of Macedon,\r\nthe Aetolian and Achaean Confederacies, which rejoiced in the accession of\r\nsuch a powerful friend. The way was thus paved for the participation of\r\nRome, as a partizan of the anti-Macedonian faction, in the struggles which\r\nhad so long divided the Greek world.\r\n\r\n*The second Illyrian war: 220–219 B. C.* The revival of Macedonian\r\ninfluence led indirectly to Rome’s second Illyrian war. The alliance of\r\nAntigonus Doson with the Achaean Confederacy and his conquest of Sparta\r\n(222 B. C.) united almost the whole of Greece under Macedonian suzerainty.\r\nThereupon Demetrius of Pharos, a despot whose rule Rome had established in\r\nCorcyra, went over to Macedonia, attacked the cities allied with Rome, and\r\nsent a piratical squadron into Greek waters (220 B. C.). Rome, now\r\nthreatened with a second Carthaginian War, acted with energy. Macedonia,\r\nunder Philip V, the successor of Antigonus Doson, was involved in a war\r\nwith the Aetolians and their allies. Deprived of support from this quarter\r\nDemetrius was speedily driven to take refuge in flight. His subjects\r\nsurrendered and Rome took possession of his chief fortresses, Pharos and\r\nDimillos.\r\n\r\n*War with the Gauls in North Italy: 225–22 B. C.* In the interval between\r\nthese Illyrian Wars Rome became involved in a serious conflict with the\r\nGallic tribes settled in the Po valley. For about half a century this\r\npeople had lived at peace with Rome, ceasing their raids into the\r\npeninsula and becoming a prosperous agricultural and pastoral people. It\r\nis claimed that they became alarmed at the Roman assignment of the public\r\nland on their southern borders, called the Ager Gallicus, to individual\r\ncolonists in 233 B. C., and that this caused them to take up arms.\r\nHowever, this territory had been Roman since 283 B. C. and its settlement\r\ncould hardly have been interpreted as an hostile act. More probable is it\r\nthat the cause of the new Gallic invasion was the coming of fresh swarms\r\nfrom across the Alps, which some of the Cisalpine Gauls, who had forgotten\r\nthe defeats of the previous generation, perhaps invited, and certainly\r\njoined, for the sake of plunder. In 238 such a band of Transalpines\r\ncrossed the Roman frontier and penetrated as far as Ariminum, but serious\r\ndissensions broke out within their own ranks and they had to withdraw.\r\nThere was no further inroad attempted until 225 B. C.\r\n\r\n*The Gallic invasion of 225 B. C.* In that year a formidable horde, called\r\nthe Gasatae, crossed the Alps and, joined by the Boii and Insubres,\r\nprepared to invade Roman territory with a force of 50,000 foot and 20,000\r\nmounted men. The Romans and Italians were seriously alarmed, for the\r\nmemory of the fatal day of the Allia had never been effaced. Rome called\r\nfor a military census of her whole federation. The lists showed 700,000\r\ninfantry and 70,000 cavalry. Expecting the Gauls to advance into Umbria\r\nthe Romans stationed an army under one consul at Ariminum. The other\r\nconsul was sent to Sardinia, possibly from fear of a Carthaginian attack,\r\nwhile the defence of Etruria was left to a force of Roman allies.\r\nAlliances were concluded with the Cenomani, a Gallic tribe to the north of\r\nthe Po, and with the Veneti.\r\n\r\nAvoiding the army at Ariminum the Gauls crossed the Apennines into\r\nEtruria, defeated the Roman allies and plundered the country. But the\r\nconsul from Ariminum hastened to the rescue, the army in Sardinia was\r\nrecalled, and the Gauls began to withdraw northwards to place their spoils\r\nin safety. The Romans followed and as the army from Sardinia landed to the\r\nnorth of the foe and cut off their retreat, the latter were surrounded and\r\nbrought to bay at Telamon. They were annihilated in a bloody battle won by\r\nthe superiority of the Roman tactics and generalship. One of the Roman\r\nconsuls fell on the field of battle.\r\n\r\n*War against the Boii and Insubres: 224–222 B. C.* Italy was saved, and\r\nnow the Romans decided to expel the Boii and the Insubres from the Po\r\nvalley as a penalty for their conduct and to prevent future invasions of\r\nthis sort by occupying their territory. In three hard-fought campaigns the\r\nRomans, while they failed to exterminate or dispossess these peoples,\r\nreduced them to subjection, forcing them to surrender part of their\r\nterritory and to pay tribute. But the Romans did not conquer without\r\nsuffering heavy losses, and their ultimate success was to a considerable\r\ndegree due to the coöperation of the Cenomani.\r\n\r\n*The Roman frontier reaches the Alps.* Between 221 and 219 the Romans\r\nsubdued the peoples of the Adriatic coast as far as the peninsula of\r\nIstria. Thus, with the exception of Liguria and the upper valley of the\r\nPo, all Italy to the south of the Alps was brought within the sphere of\r\nRoman influence. The Latin colonies Placentia and Cremona were founded in\r\nthe territory taken from the Insubres to secure the Roman authority in\r\nthis region, but Hannibal’s invasion of 217 B. C. found the Cisalpine\r\nGauls ready to revolt against the Roman yoke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 IV. THE SECOND PUNIC WAR: 218–202 B. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Carthaginian expansion in Spain.* As we have seen, the Roman seizure of\r\nSardinia and Corsica and the exaction of a fresh indemnity in 238 left a\r\nlonging for revenge in the hearts of the dominant faction at Carthage.\r\nThis faction was led by Hamilcar Barca, the victor of the mercenary war,\r\nwho saw in Spain the opportunity for repairing the fortunes of his state,\r\nfor compensating Carthage for the loss of Sicily and Sardinia, and for\r\ndeveloping an army that would enable him to face the Romans on an equal\r\nfooting. The Phoenician subjects of Carthage were hard pressed by the\r\nattacks of the native Iberian peoples when he secured for himself the\r\ncommand of the Carthaginian forces in the peninsula (238 B. C.). By\r\nskilful generalship and able diplomacy he extended the Carthaginian\r\ndominion over many of the Spanish tribes, and created a strong army,\r\ndevoted to himself and his family.\r\n\r\n*Hasdrubal.* Consequently, when Hamilcar died in battle in 229 B. C. he\r\nwas succeeded in the command by his son-in-law Hasdrubal, who carried on\r\nhis predecessor’s policy. He it was who founded the town of New Carthage\r\n(Carthagena) to serve as the center of Carthaginian influence in Spain.\r\nThe annual revenue of from 2000 to 3000 talents ($2,400,000 to $3,000,000)\r\nderived from the Spanish silver mines readily induced the Carthaginians to\r\nacquiesce in the almost regal position that the Barcidae enjoyed in Spain.\r\nThus the latter could carry out their plans without interference from the\r\nhome government.\r\n\r\n*Hasdrubal’s treaty with Rome, 226 B. C.* But the Carthaginian advance in\r\nSpain aroused the alarm of the Greeks of Massalia, and of her colonies,\r\nEmporiae and Rhodae, whose commercial interests and independence were\r\nthereby endangered. Now the Massaliots had long been in alliance with\r\nRome,—they were said to have contributed to the ransom which the Romans\r\npaid to the Gauls in 387 B. C.,—and there seems little doubt that they\r\nsecured the intervention of Rome on their behalf. In 226 B. C. the Romans\r\nconcluded a treaty with Hasdrubal which bound him not to send an armed\r\nforce north of the river Ebro. A few years later the Romans entered into a\r\ndefensive alliance with the Spanish town of Saguntum, which lay to the\r\nsouth of the Ebro, but which was not subject to Carthage. The motive of\r\nthe Romans in making this alliance is obscure, but it was probably in\r\nanswer to a request from the Saguntines.\r\n\r\n*Hannibal.* Upon the assassination of Hasdrubal in 221, Hannibal, son of\r\nHamilcar, then in his twenty-sixth year, was appointed to the command in\r\nSpain. Thereupon, relying upon the army which his predecessors and he\r\nhimself had built up in Spain and upon the resources of the Carthaginian\r\ndominions there, he resolved to take a step which would inevitably lead to\r\nwar with Rome, namely, to attack Saguntum.\r\n\r\n*The siege of Saguntum: 219 B. C.* Using as a pretext a dispute between\r\nthe Saguntines and some of his Spanish allies, he laid siege to the town\r\nin 219 B. C. and captured it after a siege of eight months. A Roman\r\nembassy appeared at Carthage to demand the surrender of Hannibal and his\r\nstaff as the price of averting war with Rome. But the anti-Roman party was\r\nin the majority and the Carthaginian senate accepted the responsibility\r\nfor the act of their general, whatever its consequences might be. The\r\nRoman ambassador replied with the declaration of war.\r\n\r\n*The Roman plan of campaign.* The most fateful result of the First Punic\r\nWar had been the destruction of the maritime supremacy of Carthage. She\r\nnever subsequently thought of contesting Rome’s dominion on the sea, and\r\nconsequently, while extending her empire in Spain and Africa she had\r\nneglected to rebuild her navy. This fact was to be of decisive importance\r\nin the coming struggle. Rome, relying upon it, planned an offensive war.\r\nOne army, under the consul Publius Cornelius Scipio, was to proceed to\r\nSpain, supported by the fleet of Massalia, and to detain Hannibal there,\r\nwhile a second army, under the other consul, Tiberius Sempronius, was\r\nassembled in Sicily to embark for Africa.\r\n\r\n*The plan of Hannibal.* But the Romans had not taken into account the\r\nmilitary genius of Hannibal, whose audacious plan of carrying the war into\r\nItaly upset their calculations. Realizing that he could not transport his\r\narmy to Italy by sea, he was prepared to cross the Pyrenees, traverse\r\nsouthern Gaul and, crossing the Alps, descend upon Italy from the north.\r\nAmong the Gauls of the Po valley he hoped to find recruits for his army,\r\nand expected that, once he was in Italy, the Roman allies would seize this\r\nopportunity of recovering their independence. Deprived of their support\r\nRome would have to yield. His ultimate object was not the destruction of\r\nRome, but the breaking up of the Roman federation in Italy, and the\r\nreduction of the Roman state to the limits attained in 340 B. C. This\r\npurpose is apparent from the plan of campaign which he followed after his\r\narrival in Italy.\r\n\r\n*Hannibal’s march into Italy.* Hannibal’s preparations were more advanced\r\nthan those of the Romans and, early in the spring of 218 B. C., he set out\r\nfrom New Carthage for the Pyrenees. Forcing a passage there, he left the\r\npasses under guard and resumed his march with a picked army of Spaniards\r\nand Numidians. His brother Hasdrubal was left in Spain to collect\r\nreinforcements and follow with them. Hannibal arrived at the Rhone and\r\ncrossed it by the time that Scipio reached Massalia on his way to Spain.\r\nThe latter, failing to force Hannibal to give battle on the banks of the\r\nRhone, returned in person to Italy, but decided to send his army, under\r\nthe command of his brother, to Spain, a decision which had the most\r\nserious consequences for Carthage. Meanwhile Hannibal continued his march\r\nand, overcoming the opposition of the peoples whose territory he\r\ntraversed, as well as the more serious obstacles of bad roads, dangerous\r\npasses, cold, and hunger, he crossed the Alps and descended into the plain\r\nof North Italy in the autumn of 218, after a march of five months.(7) His\r\narmy was reduced to 20,000 infantry and 6,000 cavalry. Practically all his\r\nelephants perished.\r\n\r\nHannibal at once found support and an opportunity to rest his weary troops\r\namong the Insubres and the Boii, the latter of whom had already taken up\r\narms against the Romans. At the news of his arrival in Italy Sempronius\r\nwas at once recalled from Sicily, but Scipio who had anticipated him\r\nventured to attack Hannibal with the forces under his command. He was\r\nbeaten in a skirmish at the river Ticinus, and Hannibal was able to cross\r\nthe Po. Upon the arrival of Sempronius, both consuls attacked the\r\nCarthaginians at the Trebia, only to receive a crushing defeat (December,\r\n218).\r\n\r\n*Hannibal invades the peninsula: 217 B. C.* Hannibal wintered in north\r\nItaly and in the spring, with an army raised to 50,000 by the addition of\r\nCeltic recruits, prepared to invade the peninsula. The Romans divided\r\ntheir forces, stationing one consul at Ariminum and the other at Arretium\r\nin Etruria. Hannibal chose to cross the Apennines and the marshes of\r\nEtruria, where he surprised and annihilated the army of the consul\r\nFlaminius at the Trasimene Lake (217 B. C.). Flaminius himself was among\r\nthe slain. This victory was soon followed by a second in which the cavalry\r\nof the army of the second consul was cut to pieces. Hannibal began his\r\nattempt to detach the Italians from the Roman alliance by releasing his\r\nItalian prisoners to carry word to their cities that he had come to set\r\nthem free. Thereupon he marched into Samnium, ravaging the Roman territory\r\nas he went.\r\n\r\nThe Romans in great consternation chose a dictator, Quintus Fabius\r\nMaximus. Fabius recognized the superiority of Hannibal’s generalship and\r\nof the Carthaginian cavalry, and consequently refused to be drawn into a\r\ngeneral engagement. But he followed the enemy closely and continually\r\nthreatened an attack, so that Hannibal could not divide his forces for\r\npurposes of raiding and foraging. Still he was able to penetrate into\r\nCampania and thence to recross the mountains into Apulia, where he decided\r\nto establish winter quarters. The strategy of Fabius, which had not\r\nprevented the enemy from securing supplies and devastating wide areas,\r\ngrew so irksome to the Romans that they violated all precedent in\r\nappointing Marcus Minucius, the master of the horse and an advocate of\r\naggressive tactics, as a second dictator. But when the latter risked an\r\nengagement, he was badly beaten and only prompt assistance from Fabius\r\nsaved his army from destruction.\r\n\r\n*Cannae: 216 B. C.* Next spring found the Romans and Carthaginians facing\r\neach other in Apulia. The Romans were led by the new consuls, Lucius\r\nAemilius Paulus and Gaius Terentius Varro. The over-confidence of Varro\r\nled to the battle of Cannae, one of the greatest battles of antiquity and\r\nthe bloodiest of all Roman defeats. Of 50,000 Romans and allies, about\r\n25,000 were slain and 10,000 captured by the numerically inferior\r\nCarthaginians. The consequences of the battle were serious. For the first\r\ntime Rome’s allies showed serious signs of disloyalty. In Apulia and in\r\nBruttium Hannibal found many adherents; ambassadors from Philip of Macedon\r\nappeared at his headquarters, the prelude to an alliance in the next year;\r\nSyracuse also, where Hiero the friend of Rome had just died, wavered and\r\nfinally went over to Carthage; and, most serious of all, Capua opened its\r\ngates to Hannibal.\r\n\r\nStill the courage of the Romans never wavered. They at once levied a new\r\nforce to replace the army destroyed at Cannae. The central Italian allies,\r\nthe Greek cities in the south, and the Latins, remained true to their\r\nallegiance, and the fortified towns of the latter proved to be the pillars\r\nof the Roman strength. For Hannibal, owing to the smallness of his army\r\nand the necessity of maintaining it in a hostile country, had to be\r\ncontinually on the march and could not undertake siege operations, for\r\nwhich he also lacked engines of war. Thus the Romans, avoiding pitched\r\nbattles, were able to attempt the systematic reduction of the towns which\r\nhad yielded to Hannibal and to hamper seriously the provisioning of his\r\nforces. At the same time they still held command of the sea, kept up their\r\noffensive in Spain, and held their ground against Carthaginian attacks in\r\nSicily and Sardinia.\r\n\r\n*Rome recovers Syracuse and Capua: 212–11 B. C.* In 213 the Romans were\r\nable to invest Syracuse. The Syracusans with the aid of engines of war\r\ndesigned by the physicist Archimedes resisted desperately, but Marcellus,\r\nthe Roman general, pressed the siege vigorously, and treachery caused the\r\ncity to fall (212 B. C.). Syracuse was sacked, its art treasures carried\r\noff to Rome, and for the future it was subject and tributary to Rome. And\r\nin Italy, although Hannibal defeated and killed the consul Tiberius\r\nSempronius Gracchus, and was able to occupy the cities of Tarentum\r\n(although not its citadel), Heraclea and Thurii, he could not prevent the\r\nRomans from laying siege to Capua (212 B. C.). The next year he thought to\r\nforce them to raise the blockade by a sudden incursion into Latium, where\r\nhe appeared before the walls of Rome. But Rome was garrisoned, the army\r\nbesieging Capua was not recalled, and Hannibal’s march was in vain. Capua\r\nwas starved into submission, its nobility put to the sword, its territory\r\nconfiscated, and its municipal organization dissolved.\r\n\r\n*Operations against Philip V. of Macedon.* Upon concluding his alliance\r\nwith Hannibal, Philip of Macedon hastened to attack the Roman possessions\r\nin Illyria. Here he met with some successes, but failed to take Corcyra or\r\nApollonia which were saved by the Roman fleet. Furthermore, Rome’s command\r\nof the sea prevented his lending any effective aid to his ally in Italy.\r\nBefore long the Romans were able to induce the Aetolians to make an\r\nalliance with them and attack Macedonia. Thereupon other enemies of\r\nPhilip, among them Sparta and King Attalus of Pergamon, joined in the war\r\non the side of Rome. The Achaean Confederacy, however, supported Philip.\r\nThe coalition against the latter was so strong that he had to cease his\r\nattacks upon Roman territory and Rome could be content with supporting her\r\nGreek allies with a small fleet, while she devoted her energies to the\r\nother theatres of war.\r\n\r\n*The war in Spain: 218–207 B. C.* The fall of Capua came at a moment most\r\nopportune for the Romans, since they had immediate need to send\r\nreinforcements to Spain. Thither, as we have seen, they had sent an army\r\nin 218 B. C. under Gnaeus Scipio, who obtained a foothold north of the\r\nEbro. In the next year he was joined by his brother Publius Cornelius.\r\nThereupon the Romans crossed the Ebro and invaded the Carthaginian\r\ndominions to the south. A revolt of the Numidians caused the recall of\r\nHasdrubal to Africa, and the Romans were able to capture Saguntum and\r\ninduce many Spanish tribes to desert the Carthaginian cause. However, upon\r\nthe return of Hasdrubal and the arrival of reinforcements from Carthage,\r\nthe Carthaginian commanders united their forces and crushed the two Roman\r\narmies one after the other (211 B. C.). Both the Scipios fell in battle\r\nand the Carthaginians recovered all their territory south of the Ebro.\r\n\r\n*Publius Cornelius Scipio sent to Spain: 210 B. C.* Undismayed by these\r\ndisasters the Romans determined to continue their efforts to conquer Spain\r\nbecause of its importance as a recruiting ground for the Carthaginian\r\narmies and because the continuance of the war there prevented\r\nreinforcements being sent to Hannibal in Italy. The fall of Capua and the\r\nfortunate turn of events in Sicily enabled them to release fresh troops\r\nfor service in Spain, and in 210 B. C., being dissatisfied with the\r\ncautious strategy of the pro-praetor Nero, then commanding north of the\r\nEbro, the Senate determined to send out a commander who would continue the\r\naggressive tactics of the Scipios. As the most suitable person they fixed\r\non Publius Cornelius Scipio, son of the like-named consul who had fallen\r\nin 211. However, he was only in his twenty-fourth year and having filled\r\nno magistracy except the aedileship, he was technically disqualified from\r\nexercising the _imperium_. Therefore, his appointment was made the subject\r\nof a special law in the Comitia, which nominated him to the command in\r\nSpain with the rank of a pro-consul. This is the first authentic instance\r\nof the conferment of the _imperium_ upon a private citizen.\r\n\r\n*The capture of New Carthage: 209 B. C.* Seeing that the armies of his\r\nopponents were divided and engaged in reconquering the Spanish tribes,\r\nScipio resumed the offensive, crossed the Ebro, and by a daring stroke\r\nseized the chief Carthaginian base—New Carthage. Here he found vast stores\r\nof supplies and, more important still, the hostages from the Spanish\r\npeoples subject to Carthage. His liberation of these, and his generous\r\ntreatment of the Spaniards in general was in such striking contrast with\r\nthe oppressive measures of the Carthaginians, that he rapidly won over to\r\nhis support both the enemies and the adherents of the former.\r\n\r\n*Hasdrubal’s march to Italy: 208 B. C.* Meanwhile in Italy the Romans\r\nproceeded steadily with the reduction of the strongholds in the hands of\r\nHannibal. Tarentum was recovered in 210, and although Hannibal defeated\r\nand slew the consuls Gnaeus Fulvius (210) and Marcus Marcellus (208), his\r\nforces were so diminished that his maintaining himself in Italy depended\r\nupon the arrival of strong reinforcements. Since his arrival he had\r\nreceived but insignificant additions to his army from Carthage, whose\r\nenergies had been directed to the other theatres of war. Up to this time\r\nalso the Roman activities in Spain had prevented any Carthaginian troops\r\nleaving that country. But after the fall of New Carthage and the\r\nsubsequent successes of Scipio, Hasdrubal, despairing of the situation\r\nthere, determined to march to the support of his brother by the same route\r\nwhich the latter had taken. Scipio endeavored to bar his path, but\r\nalthough Hasdrubal was defeated in battle he and 10,000 of his men cut\r\ntheir way through the Romans and crossed the Pyrenees (208 B. C.).\r\n\r\n*The Metaurus: 207 B. C.* The next spring he arrived among the Gauls to\r\nthe south of the Alps. Reinforced by them he marched into the peninsula to\r\njoin forces with Hannibal. For the Romans it was of supreme importance to\r\nprevent this. They therefore divided their forces; the consul Gaius\r\nClaudius faced Hannibal in Apulia, while Marcus Livius went to intercept\r\nHasdrubal. Through the capture of messengers sent by the latter Claudius\r\nlearned of his position and, leaving part of his army to detain Hannibal,\r\nhe withdrew the rest without his enemy’s knowledge and joined his\r\ncolleague Livius. Together they attacked Hasdrubal at the Metaurus; his\r\narmy was cut to pieces and he himself was slain. With the battle the doom\r\nof Hannibal’s plans was sealed, and with them the doom of Carthage.\r\nHannibal himself recognized that all was lost and withdrew into the\r\nmountains of Bruttium.\r\n\r\n*The conquest of Carthaginian Spain, and peace with Philip.* For the first\r\ntime in the war the Romans could breathe freely and look forward with\r\nconfidence to the issue. In the two years (207–206 B. C.) following the\r\ndeparture of Hasdrubal Scipio completed the conquest of what remained to\r\nCarthage in Spain. In 205 he returned to Rome to enter upon the\r\nconsulship, and thereupon went to Sicily to make preparations for the\r\ninvasion of Africa, since the Romans were now able to carry out their plan\r\nof 218 B. C. which Hannibal had then interrupted. At this moment, too, the\r\nRomans found themselves free from any embarrassment from the side of\r\nMacedonia. In Greece the war had dragged on without any decided advantage\r\nfor either side until 207, when the temporary withdrawal of the Roman\r\nfleet enabled Philip and the Achaean Confederacy to win such successes\r\nthat their opponents listened to the intervention of the neutral states\r\nand made peace (206 B. C.). In the next year the Romans also came to terms\r\nwith Philip.\r\n\r\n*The invasion of Africa: 204 B. C.* In 204 B. C. Scipio transported his\r\narmy to Africa. At first, however, he was able to do nothing before the\r\ncombined forces of the Carthaginians and the Numidian chief, Syphax, who\r\nhad renewed his alliance with them. But in the following year he routed\r\nboth armies so decisively that he was able to capture and depose Syphax,\r\nand to set up in his place a rival chieftain, Masinissa, whose adherence\r\nto the Romans brought them a welcome superiority in cavalry. The\r\nCarthaginians now sought to make peace. An armistice was granted them;\r\nHannibal and all Carthaginian forces were recalled from Italy, and the\r\npreliminary terms of peace drawn up (203 B. C.). Hannibal left Italy with\r\nthe remnant of his veterans after a campaign which had established his\r\nreputation as one of the world’s greatest masters of the art of war. For\r\nnearly fifteen years he had maintained himself in the enemy’s country with\r\ngreatly inferior forces, and now after inflicting many severe defeats and\r\nnever losing a battle he was forced to withdraw because of lack of\r\nresources, not because of the superior generalship of his foes. Before\r\nleaving Italian soil he set up a record of his exploits in the temple of\r\nHera Lacinia in Bruttium.\r\n\r\n*Zama: 202 B. C.* An almost incredible feeling of over-confidence seems to\r\nhave been aroused in Carthage by the arrival of Hannibal. The\r\nCarthaginians broke the armistice by attacking some Roman transports and\r\nrefused to meet Scipio’s demand for an explanation. Hostilities were\r\ntherefore resumed. At Zama the two greatest generals the war had developed\r\nmet in its final battle. Hannibal’s tactics were worthy of his reputation\r\nbut his army was crushed by the flight of the Carthaginian mercenaries at\r\na critical moment, and by the Roman superiority in cavalry(8).\r\n\r\n*Peace: 201 B. C.* For Carthage all hope of resistance was over and she\r\nhad to accept the Roman terms. These were: the surrender of all territory\r\nexcept the city of Carthage and the surrounding country in Africa, an\r\nindemnity of 10,000 talents ($12,000,000), the surrender of all vessels of\r\nwar except ten triremes, and of all war elephants, and the obligation to\r\nrefrain from carrying on war outside of Africa, or even in Africa unless\r\nwith Rome’s consent. The Numidians were united in a strong state on the\r\nCarthaginian borders, under the Roman ally Masinissa. Scipio returned to\r\nRome to triumph “over the Carthaginians and Hannibal,” and to receive,\r\nfrom the scene of his victory, the name of Africanus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             V. THE EFFECT OF THE SECOND PUNIC WAR UPON ITALY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe destruction of the Carthaginian empire left Rome mistress of the\r\nwestern Mediterranean and by far the greatest power of the time. But this\r\nvictory had only been attained after a tremendous struggle, the greatest\r\nprobably that the ancient world ever witnessed, a struggle which called\r\nforth in Rome the patriotic virtues of courage, devotion, and\r\nself-sacrifice to a degree that aroused the admiration of subsequent\r\ngenerations, which drained her resources of men and treasure and which\r\nleft ineffaceable scars upon the soil of Italy.\r\n\r\nOne of the main factors in deciding the issue was the Roman command of the\r\nsea which Carthage never felt able to challenge seriously. Another was the\r\nlarger citizen body of Rome, and the friendly relations between herself\r\nand her federate allies. This, with the system of universal military\r\nservice, gave her a citizen soldiery which in morale and numbers was\r\nsuperior to the armies of Carthage. As long as Hannibal was in Italy Rome\r\nkept from year to year upwards of 100,000 men in the field. Once only,\r\nafter the battle of Cannae, was she unable to replace her losses by the\r\nregular system of recruiting and had to arm 8000 slaves who were promised\r\nfreedom as a reward for faithful service. On the other hand, Carthage had\r\nto raise her forces from mercenaries or from subject allies. As her\r\nresources dwindled the former became ever more difficult to obtain, while\r\nthe demands made upon the latter caused revolts that cost much effort to\r\nsubdue. It required the personality of a Hannibal to develop an _esprit de\r\ncorps_ and discipline such as characterized his army in Italy. A third\r\nfactor was the absence in the Roman commanders of the personal rivalries\r\nand lack of coöperation which so greatly hampered the Carthaginians in\r\nSpain and in Sicily. Still one must not be led into the error of supposing\r\nthat the Carthaginians did not display tenacity and patriotism to a very\r\nhigh degree. The senatorial class especially distinguished itself by\r\ncourage and ability, and there are no evidences of factional strife\r\nhampering the conduct of the war. The Romans overcame the disadvantage of\r\nthe annual change of commanders-in-chief by the use of the proconsulship\r\nand pro-praetorship often long prorogued, whereby officers of ability\r\nretained year after year the command of the same armies. This system\r\nenabled them to develop such able generals as Metellus and the Scipios.\r\n\r\nThe cost of maintaining her fleet and her armies taxed the financial\r\nresources of Rome to the utmost. The government had to make use of a\r\nreserve fund which had been accumulating in the treasury for thirty years\r\nfrom the returns of the 5% tax on the value of manumitted slaves, and the\r\narmies in Spain could only be kept in the field by the generosity and\r\npatriotism of several companies of contractors who furnished supplies at\r\ntheir own expense until the end of the war. An additional burden was the\r\nincreased cost of the necessities of life and the danger of a grain\r\nfamine, caused by the disturbed conditions in Italy and Sicily and the\r\nwithdrawal of so many men from agricultural occupations. In 210 the\r\nsituation was only relieved by an urgent appeal to Ptolemy Philopator of\r\nEgypt, from whom grain had to be purchased at three times the usual price.\r\nHowever, this crisis passed with the pacification of Sicily in the next\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, a heavy tribute had been levied upon the man power of the\r\nRoman state. The census list of citizens eligible for military service\r\nfell from about 280,000 at the beginning of the war to 237,000 in 209; and\r\nthe federate allies must have suffered at least as heavily. The greatest\r\nlosses fell upon the southern part of the peninsula. There, year after\r\nyear, the fields had been laid waste and the villages devastated by the\r\nopposing armies, until the rural population had almost entirely\r\ndisappeared, the land had become a wilderness, and the more prosperous\r\ncities had fallen into decay. From the effects of these ravages southern\r\nItaly never recovered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\n                  ROMAN DOMINATION IN THE MEDITERRANEAN\r\n\r\n\r\n         THE SECOND PHASE: ROME AND THE GREEK EAST, 200–167 B. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               I. THE SECOND MACEDONIAN WAR: 200–196 B. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n*The eastern crisis: 202 B. C.* The Roman senate had been eager to\r\nconclude a satisfactory peace with Carthage as soon as possible in order\r\nto devote its undivided attention to a crisis which had arisen in the\r\neastern Mediterranean. There Ptolemy IV of Egypt had died in 203 B. C.,\r\nleaving the kingdom to an infant son who was in the hands of corrupt and\r\ndissolute advisors. Egypt had lost her command of the eastern\r\nMediterranean at the time of Rome’s First Carthaginian War, and later (217\r\nB. C.) had only saved herself in a war against Syria by calling to arms a\r\nportion of the native population. This step had led to internal racial\r\ndifficulties which weakened the position of the dynasty. At this juncture\r\nPhilip V of Macedon, who had emerged with credit from his recent struggle\r\nwith Rome and his foes in Greece, and Antiochus III of Syria, who had just\r\nreturned from a series of successful campaigns (212–204 B. C.) which had\r\nrecovered for his kingdom its eastern provinces as far as the Indus and\r\nhad won for him the surname of “the Great,” judged the moment favorable\r\nfor the realization of long-cherished ambitions at the expense of their\r\nrival, Egypt. They formed an alliance for the conquest of the outlying\r\npossessions of the Ptolemies, whereby Philip was to occupy those in the\r\nAegean, while Antiochus was to seize Phoenicia and Palestine. In 202 B. C.\r\nthey opened hostilities.\r\n\r\n*The appeal for Roman intervention: 201 B. C.* But the operations of the\r\nforces of Philip in the Aegean brought him into war with Rhodes and with\r\nAttalus, King of Pergamon, while in Greece a quarrel, which developed\r\nbetween some of his allies and the Athenians, involved him in hostilities\r\nwith the latter. From these three states and from Egypt, which, having\r\nbeen unable to prevent Antiochus from occupying her Syrian possessions,\r\nwas now threatened with invasion, envoys were sent to Rome, to request\r\nRoman intervention on their behalf, on the ground that they were friends\r\n(_amici_) of Rome.\r\n\r\n*The status of amicitia.* The Romans had adopted the idea of international\r\nfriendship (_amicitia_, _philia_) from the Greeks in the course of the\r\nthird century. Previously, their only conception of friendly relations\r\nbetween states was that of alliance (_societas_) based upon a perpetual\r\ntreaty (_foedus_), which bound each party to render military assistance to\r\nthe other and which neither could terminate at discretion. However, under\r\nthe influence of ideas current among the Hellenic states they began to\r\nform friendships, i. e. to open up diplomatic relations with states and\r\nrulers. These _amici_ (friends) could remain neutral in case Rome engaged\r\nin war, or they could render Rome support, which was, however, voluntary\r\nand not obligatory. And Rome enjoyed a similar freedom of action with\r\nregard to them.\r\n\r\n*Rome intervenes: 200 B. C.* The Roman Senate, influenced by mixed\r\nmotives—sympathy for the Hellenes and their culture, ambition to appear as\r\narbiters of the fate of the Greek world, a desire for revenge upon Philip\r\nfor his partial successes in the late war, and fear of seeing him develop\r\ninto a more powerful enemy—was anxious to intervene. But, although the\r\nRoman fetials, the members of the priestly college which was the guardian\r\nof the Roman traditions in international relations, decided that Attalus\r\nand the other Roman _amici_ might be regarded as allies (_socii_) and so\r\nbe defended legitimately, the Roman people as a whole shrank from\r\nembarking upon another war. The Comitia once voted against the proposal,\r\nand at a second meeting was only induced to sanction it, when it was\r\nrepresented to them that they would have to face another invasion of Italy\r\nif they did not anticipate Philip’s action.\r\n\r\n*The Roman ultimatum.* The Senate next sent ambassadors to the East to\r\npresent an ultimatum to Philip, and at the same time to negotiate with\r\nAntiochus for the cessation of his attacks upon Egypt, for the Romans did\r\nnot wish to have his forces added to those of the Macedonian king. When\r\nPhilip was engaged in the siege of Abydos on the Hellespont he received\r\nthe Roman terms, which were that he should abstain from attacking any\r\ncities of the Greeks or the possessions of Ptolemy, and should submit to\r\narbitration his disputes with Attalus and the Rhodians. Upon his rejection\r\nof these proposals the war opened.\r\n\r\n*The Romans cross the Adriatic.* Late in 200 B. C. a Roman army under the\r\nconsul Sulpicius crossed into Illyricum and endeavored to penetrate into\r\nMacedonia. However, both in this and in the succeeding year, the Romans,\r\nalthough aided by the forces of the Aetolian Confederacy, Pergamon, Rhodes\r\nand Athens, were unable to inflict any decisive defeat upon Philip or to\r\ninvade his kingdom.\r\n\r\nHowever, with the arrival of the consul of 198, Titus Flamininus, the\r\nsituation speedily changed. The Achaean Confederacy was won over to the\r\nside of Rome, and Flamininus succeeded in forcing Philip to evacuate his\r\nposition in Epirus and to withdraw into Thessaly. In the following winter\r\nnegotiations for peace were opened, but these led to nothing, for the\r\nRomans demanded the evacuation of Corinth, Chalcis and Demetrias, three\r\nfortresses known as “the fetters of Greece,” and Philip refused to make\r\nthis concession.\r\n\r\n*Cynoscephalae: 197 B. C.* The next year military operations were resumed\r\nwith both armies in Thessaly. Early in the summer a battle was fought on a\r\nridge of hills called Cynoscephalae (the Dog’s Heads) where the Romans won\r\na complete victory. Although the Aetolians tendered valuable assistance in\r\nthis engagement, the Macedonian defeat was due to the superior flexibility\r\nof the Roman legionary formation over the phalanx. Philip fled to\r\nMacedonia and sued for peace. The Aetolians and his enemies in Greece\r\nsought his utter destruction, but Flamininus realized the importance of\r\nMacedonia to the Greek world as a bulwark against the Celtic peoples of\r\nthe lower Danube and would not support their demands. The terms fixed by\r\nthe Roman Senate were: the autonomy of the Hellenes, the evacuation of the\r\nMacedonian possessions in Greece, in the Aegean, and in Illyricum, and an\r\nindemnity of 1000 talents ($1,200,000). The conditions Philip was obliged\r\nto accept (196 B. C.).\r\n\r\n*The proclamation of Flamininus: 196 B. C.* At the Isthmian games of the\r\nsame year Flamininus proclaimed the complete autonomy of the peoples who\r\nhad been subject to Macedonia. The announcement provoked a tremendous\r\noutburst of enthusiasm. After spending some time in carrying this\r\nproclamation into effect and in settling the claims of various states,\r\nFlamininus returned to Italy in 194, leaving the Greeks to make what use\r\nthey could of their freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  II. THE WAR WITH ANTIOCHUS THE GREAT AND THE AETOLIANS: 192–189 B. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Antiochus in Asia Minor and Thrace.* Even before Flamininus and his army\r\nhad withdrawn from Greece the activities of Antiochus had awakened the\r\nmistrust of the Roman Senate and threatened to lead to hostilities. The\r\nSyrian king had completed the conquest of Lower Syria in 198, and then,\r\nprofiting by the difficulties in which Philip of Macedon was involved, he\r\nturned his attention towards Asia Minor and Thrace with the hope of\r\nrecovering the possessions once held by his ancestor, Seleucus I, in these\r\nquarters. The Romans were at the time too much occupied to oppose him,\r\nand, outwardly, he professed to be the friend of Rome and to be limiting\r\nhis activities to the reëstablishing of his empire to its former extent.\r\nEventually, in 195 B. C., he crossed over into Europe and proceeded to\r\nestablish himself in Thrace. Negotiations with the Roman Senate seemed\r\nlikely to lead to an agreement that the king should limit his expansion to\r\nAsia and recognize a sort of Roman suzerainty in Europe, when the action\r\nof the Aetolians precipitated a conflict.\r\n\r\n*The Aetolians and Rome.* The Aetolians, who had been Rome’s allies in the\r\nwar just concluded and who greatly exaggerated the importance of their\r\nservices, were disgruntled because the kingdom of Macedonia had not been\r\nentirely dismembered and they had been restrained from enlarging the\r\nterritory of the Confederacy at the expense of their neighbors. In short,\r\nthey wished to take the place formerly held by Macedonia among the Greek\r\nstates. Accustomed to regard war as a legitimate source of revenue, they\r\ndid not easily reconcile themselves to Rome’s preservation of peace in\r\nHellas. Ever since the battle of Cynoscephalae they had striven to\r\nundermine Roman influence among the Greeks, and now they sought to draw\r\nAntiochus into conflict with Rome.\r\n\r\n*Antiochus invades Greece: 192 B. C.* In 192 B. C. they elected Antiochus\r\nas commander-in-chief of the forces of their confederacy and seized the\r\nfortress of Chalcis. This they offered to the king, to whom they also made\r\nan unauthorized promise of aid from Macedonia. Thereupon, trusting in the\r\nsupport promised by the Aetolians, Antiochus sailed to Greece with a small\r\nforce of 10,000 men. It so happened that Hannibal, who in 196 B. C. had\r\nbeen forced to flee his native city owing to the machinations of his\r\nenemies and the Romans, was then at the court of Antiochus, where he had\r\ntaken refuge. He advised his protector to invade the Italian peninsula,\r\nbut Antiochus rejected the advice, probably with wisdom, for such a course\r\nwould have required him to win the control of the sea, which was a task\r\nbeyond his resources. But when, throughout his whole campaign, he\r\nneglected to make use of the services of the greatest commander of the\r\nage, he committed a most serious blunder. Had Hannibal led the forces of\r\nAntiochus the task of the Romans would not have been so simple.\r\n\r\n*Antiochus driven from Greece: 191 B. C.* In 191 a Roman army under the\r\nconsul Acilius Glabrio appeared in Greece and attacked and defeated the\r\nforces of Antiochus at Thermopylae. The king fled to Asia. Contrary to his\r\nhopes he had found but little support in Greece. Philip of Macedon and the\r\nAchaean Confederacy adhered to the Romans, and the Aetolians were rendered\r\nhelpless by an invasion of their own country. Furthermore, the Rhodians\r\nand Eumenes, the new King of Pergamon, joined their navies to the Roman\r\nfleet.\r\n\r\n*The Romans cross over to Asia Minor: 190 B. C.* As Antiochus would not\r\nhearken to the terms of peace laid down by the Romans, the latter resolved\r\nupon the invasion of Asia Minor. Two naval battles, won by the aid of\r\nRhodes and Pergamon, secured the control of the Aegean and in 190 B. C. a\r\nRoman force crossed the Hellespont. For its commander the Senate had\r\nwished to designate Scipio Africanus, the greatest of the Roman generals.\r\nHowever, as he had recently been consul he was now ineligible for that\r\noffice. The obstacle of the law was accordingly circumvented by the\r\nelection of his brother Lucius to the consulate and his assignment to this\r\ncommand, and by the appointment of Publius to accompany him as\r\nextraordinary proconsul, with power equal to his own.\r\n\r\n*Magnesia: 190 B. C.* One decisive victory over Antiochus at Magnesia in\r\nthe autumn of 190 B. C. brought him to terms. He agreed to surrender all\r\nterritory to the north of the Taurus mountains and west of Pamphylia, to\r\ngive up his war elephants, to surrender all but ten of his ships of war,\r\nto pay an indemnity of 15,000 talents ($18,000,000) in twelve annual\r\ninstalments, and to abstain from attacking the allies of Rome. Still,\r\nunlike Carthage, he was at liberty to defend himself if attacked. The\r\nRomans then proceeded to establish order in Asia Minor. The territories of\r\ntheir friends, Rhodes and Pergamon, were materially increased, while the\r\nenemies of the latter, the Celts of Galatia were defeated and forced to\r\npay a heavy indemnity. Rome retained no territory in Asia, but left the\r\ncountry divided among a number of small states whose mutual jealousies\r\nrendered impossible the rise of a strong power which could venture to set\r\naside the Roman arrangements.\r\n\r\n*The subjugation of the Aetolians: 189 B. C.* The Roman campaign of 191\r\nagainst the Aetolians had caused the latter, who were also attacked by\r\nPhilip of Macedon, to seek terms. However, as the Romans demanded an\r\nunconditional surrender, the Aetolians decided to continue the struggle.\r\nIn the next year no energetic measures were taken against them, but in 189\r\nthe consul Fulvius Nobilior pressed the war vigorously and besieged their\r\nchief city, Ambracia. But since the obstinate resistance of its defenders\r\ndefied all his efforts, and since the Athenians were trying to act as\r\nmediators in bringing the war to a close, the Romans abandoned their\r\ndemand for an unconditional surrender and peace was made on the following\r\nconditions. The Aetolian Confederacy gave up all territory captured by its\r\nenemies during the war and entered into a permanent alliance with Rome,\r\nwhereby it was bound to send contingents to the Roman armies. Ambracia was\r\nsurrendered and destroyed, and the Romans occupied the pirate nest of\r\nCephallenia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               III. THE THIRD MACEDONIAN WAR: 171–167 B. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Rome and the Greek states.* Although by her alliance with the Aetolians\r\nRome had planted herself permanently on Greek soil, and in the war with\r\nAntiochus had claimed to exercise a sort of protectorate over the Greek\r\nworld, still the Senate as yet gave no indication of reversing the policy\r\nof Flamininus, and the Greek states remained as the friends of Rome in the\r\nenjoyment of political independence. However, it was not long before these\r\nfriendly relations became seriously strained and Rome was induced to\r\nembark upon a policy of interference in Greek affairs which ultimately put\r\nan end to the apparent freedom of Hellas. The fundamental cause of this\r\nchange was that while Rome interpreted Greek freedom to mean liberty of\r\naction provided that the wishes and arrangements of Rome were respected,\r\nthe Greeks understood it to mean the perfect freedom of sovereign\r\ncommunities, and resented bitterly any infringement of their rights.\r\nKeeping in mind these conflicting points of view, it is easy to see how\r\ndifficulties were bound to arise which would inevitably be settled\r\naccording to the wishes of the stronger power.\r\n\r\n*Rome and the Achaeans.* The chief specific causes for the change in the\r\nRoman policy are to be found in the troubles of the Achaean Confederacy\r\nand the reviving ambitions of Macedonia. The Confederacy included many\r\ncity-states which had been compelled to join it and which sought to regain\r\ntheir independence. This the Confederacy was determined to prevent. One\r\nsuch community was Sparta, and the policy of the Achaeans towards it in\r\nthe matter of the restoration of Spartan exiles led to the Spartans\r\nappealing to Rome. The Roman decision wounded the susceptibilities of the\r\nConfederacy without settling the problem, and the tendency of the Achaeans\r\nto stand upon their rights provoked the anger of the Romans. Within the\r\nConfederacy there developed a pro-Roman party ready to submit to Roman\r\ndictatorship, and a national party determined to assert their right to\r\nfreedom of action. From 180 B. C. the Romans deliberately fostered the\r\naristocratic factions throughout the cities of Greece, feeling that they\r\nwere the more stable element and more in harmony with the policy of the\r\nSenate. As a consequence the democratic factions began to look for outside\r\nsupport and cast their eyes towards Macedonia.\r\n\r\n*Rome and Macedonia.* Philip V of Macedon considered that the assistance\r\nwhich he had furnished to Rome in the Syrian War was proof of his loyalty\r\nand warranted the annexation of the territory he had overrun in that\r\nconflict. But the Senate was not inclined to allow the power of Macedonia\r\nto attain dangerous proportions, and he was forced to forego his claims.\r\nHenceforth he was the bitter foe of the Romans. He devoted himself to the\r\ndevelopment of the military resources of his kingdom with the ultimate\r\nview of again challenging Rome’s authority in Greece. At his death in 179\r\nB. C. he left an army of from 30,000 to 40,000 men and a treasure of 6,000\r\ntalents ($7,200,000). His son and successor Perseus inherited his father’s\r\nanti-Roman policy and entered into relations with the foes of Rome\r\neverywhere in Greece.\r\n\r\n*The Third Macedonian War: 171–167 B. C.* But the Senate was kept well\r\naware of his schemes by his enemies in Greece, especially Eumenes of\r\nPergamon. Therefore they determined to forestall the completion of his\r\nplans and force him into war. In 172, a Roman commission visited Perseus\r\nand required of him concessions which meant the extinction of his\r\nindependence. Upon his refusal to comply with the demands they returned\r\nhome and Rome declared war. Now, when success depended upon energetic\r\naction, Perseus sought to avoid the issue and tried to placate the Romans,\r\nbut in vain. In 171 a Roman force landed in Greece and made its way to\r\nThessaly. But in the campaigns of this and the following year the Roman\r\ncommanders were too incapable and their troops too undisciplined to make\r\nany headway. Nor did Perseus show ability to take advantage of his\r\nopportunities. Furthermore, by his parsimony he lost the chance to win\r\nvaluable aid from the Dardanians, Gesatae, and Celts on his borders.\r\nFinally, in 168, the Romans found an able general in the consul Aemilius\r\nPaulus, who restored the morale of the Roman soldiers and won a complete\r\nvictory over Perseus in the battle of Pydna. The Macedonian kingdom was at\r\nan end; its territory was divided into four autonomous republics, which\r\nwere forbidden mutual privileges of _commercium_ and _connubium_; a yearly\r\ntribute of fifty talents was imposed upon them; and the royal mines and\r\ndomains became the property of the Roman state.\r\n\r\n*The aftermath of the war.* Having disposed of Macedon the Romans turned\r\ntheir attention to the other Greek states with the intention of rewarding\r\ntheir friends and punishing their enemies. Everywhere death or exile\r\nawaited the leaders of the anti-Roman party, many of whose names became\r\nknown from the seizure of the papers of Perseus. Although the Achaeans had\r\ngiven no positive proof of disloyalty 1000 of their leading men, among\r\nthem the historian Polybius, were carried off to Italy nominally to be\r\ngiven the chance of clearing themselves before the Senate but really to be\r\nkept as hostages in Italy for the future conduct of the Confederacy.\r\n\r\nThe Rhodians, because they had endeavored to secure a peaceful settlement\r\nbetween Rome and Perseus, were forced to surrender their possessions in\r\nAsia Minor, and a ruinous blow was dealt to their commercial prosperity by\r\nthe establishment of a free port at the island of Delos. Eumenes of\r\nPergamon, whose actions had aroused suspicions, had to recognize the\r\nindependence of the Galatians whom he had subdued. Far worse was the fate\r\nof Epirus. There seventy towns were sacked and their inhabitants to the\r\nnumber of 150,000 carried off into slavery.\r\n\r\nHenceforth it was clear that Rome was the real sovereign in the eastern\r\nMediterranean and that her friends and allies only enjoyed local autonomy,\r\nwhile they were expected to be obedient to the orders of Rome. This is\r\nwell illustrated by the anecdote of the circle of Popilius. During the\r\nThird Macedonian War, Antiochus IV, Epiphanes, King of Syria, had invaded\r\nEgypt. After the battle of Pydna a Roman ambassador, Popilius by name, was\r\nsent to make him withdraw. Popilius met Antiochus before Alexandria and\r\ndelivered the Senate’s message. The king asked for time for consideration,\r\nbut the Roman, drawing a circle around him in the sand, bade him answer\r\nbefore he left the spot. Antiochus yielded and evacuated Egypt.\r\n\r\nThe spoils of this war with Macedonia brought an enormous booty into the\r\nRoman treasury, and from this time the war tax on property—the _tributum\r\ncivium Romanorum_—ceased to be levied. The income of the empire enabled\r\nthe government to relieve Roman citizens of all direct taxation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     IV. CAMPAIGNS IN ITALY AND SPAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the Macedonian and Syrian Wars the Romans were busy strengthening\r\nand extending their hold upon northern Italy and Spain.\r\n\r\n*Cisalpine Gaul.* Cisalpine Gaul, which had been largely lost to the\r\nRomans since Hannibal’s invasion, was recovered by wars with the Insubres\r\nand Boii between 198 and 191 B. C. A new military highway, the _via\r\nFlaminia_, was built from Rome to Ariminum in 187, and later extended\r\nunder the name of the _via Aemilia_ to Placentia; another, the _via\r\nCassia_ (171 B. C.), linked Rome and the Po valley by way of Etruria. New\r\nfortresses were established; Bononia (189) and Aquileia (181) as Latin\r\ncolonies; Parma and Mutina (183) as colonies of Roman citizens. In this\r\nway Roman authority was firmly established and the way prepared for the\r\nrapid Latinization of the land between the Apennines and the Alps.\r\n\r\n*The Ligurians.* In the same period falls the subjugation of the\r\nLigurians. In successive campaigns, lasting until 172 B. C., the Romans\r\ngradually extended their sway over the various Ligurian tribes until they\r\nreached the territory of Massalia in southern Gaul. Roman colonies were\r\nfounded at Pisa (180) and Luna (177).\r\n\r\n*Spain.* The territory acquired from Carthage in Spain was organized into\r\ntwo provinces, called Hither and Farther Spain, in 197 B. C. But the\r\nallied and subject Spanish tribes were not yet reconciled to the presence\r\nof the Romans and serious revolts broke out. One of these was subdued by\r\nMarcus Porcius Cato in 196, another by Lucius Aemilius Paulus between 191\r\nand 189, and a third by Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus in 179 and 178 B. C.\r\nThe settlement effected by Gracchus secured peace for many years. In Spain\r\nwere founded Rome’s first colonies beyond the borders of Italy. Italica,\r\nnear Seville, was settled in 206, and Carteia in 171; both as Latin\r\ncolonies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\n         TERRITORIAL EXPANSION IN THREE CONTINENTS: 167–133 B. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Roman foreign policy.* The foreign relations of Rome from 167 to 133\r\nB. C. fall into two distinct periods. In the earlier, Roman foreign policy\r\nis directed towards securing Roman domination throughout the Mediterranean\r\nby diplomatic means. War and annexation of territory are avoided as\r\ncausing too great a drain upon the resources of the state and creating\r\ndifficult administrative problems. In the later period this policy is\r\nabandoned for one more aggressively imperialistic, which does not hesitate\r\nto appeal to armed force and aims at the incorporation of conquered\r\nterritory within the empire. This change of policy was largely due to the\r\ninfluence of that group in the senate which was eager for foreign\r\ncommands, the honors of a triumph, and the spoils of war, as well as that\r\nof the non-senatorial financial interests which sought to open up new\r\nfields for exploitation. It was also felt that the prestige of Rome had\r\nsuffered by the disregard of some of her diplomatic representations.\r\n\r\nThis policy of expansion resulted in prolonged wars in Spain, the\r\nannexation of Carthage and Macedon, the establishment of direct control\r\nover Greece, and the acquisition of territory in Asia Minor. The new\r\ntendencies become apparent shortly before 150 B. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    I. THE SPANISH WARS: 154–133 B. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n*The revolts of the Celtiberians and the Lusitanians: 154–139 B. C.* In\r\n154 B. C. revolts broke out in both Hither and Farther Spain. A series of\r\nlong and bloody campaigns ensued, which were prolonged by the incapacity,\r\ncruelty and faithlessness of the Roman commanders, and caused a heavy\r\ndrain upon the military resources of Italy. The chief opponents of the\r\nRomans were the Celtiberians of Hither, and the Lusitanians of Farther\r\nSpain. The desperate character of these wars made service in Spain very\r\nunpopular, and levies for the campaign of 151 were raised with difficulty.\r\nThe tribunes interceded to protect certain persons, and when their\r\nintercession was disregarded by the consuls they cast the latter into\r\nprison. In 150 B. C. the pro-consul Galba treacherously massacred\r\nthousands of Lusitanians with whom he had made a treaty. For this he was\r\nbrought to trial by Cato, but was acquitted.\r\n\r\nThe massacre led to a renewed outbreak under Viriathus, an able guerilla\r\nleader who defied the power of Rome for about eight years (147–139 B. C.).\r\nForced eventually to yield, he was assassinated during an armistice by\r\ntraitors suborned by the Roman commander. The complete subjugation of the\r\nLusitanians soon followed.\r\n\r\n*The war with Numantia: 143–133 B. C.* Meantime, after an interval of some\r\nyears, in 143 the war had broken out afresh in the nearer province where\r\nthe struggle centered about the town of Numantia. In 140 the Roman general\r\nPompeius made peace upon easy terms with the Numantines, but later\r\nrepudiated it, and the Senate ignored his arrangements. Again in 138 the\r\ntribunes interfered with the levy, so great was the popular aversion to\r\nservice in Spain. The next year witnessed the disgraceful surrender of the\r\nconsul Mancinus and his army, comprising 20,000 Romans, to the Numantines.\r\nBy concluding a treaty he saved the lives of his army. But the Roman\r\nSenate perfidiously rejected the sworn agreement of the consul, made him\r\nthe scapegoat and delivered him bound to the Numantines, who would have\r\nnone of him.\r\n\r\nAt length, weary of defeats, the Romans re-elected to the consulship for\r\n134 B. C. their tried general Scipio Aemilianus, the conqueror of\r\nCarthage, and appointed him as commander in Spain. His first task was to\r\nrestore the discipline in his army. Then he opened the blockade of\r\nNumantia. After a siege of fifteen months the city was starved into\r\nsubmission and completely destroyed. A commission of ten senators\r\nreorganized the country and Spain entered upon a long era of peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              II. THE DESTRUCTION OF CARTHAGE: 149–146 B. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n*The Third Punic War: 149–146 B. C. Its causes.* The treaty which ended\r\nthe Second Punic War had forbidden the Carthaginians the right to make war\r\noutside of Africa, or within it without the consent of Rome. At the same\r\ntime their enemy Masinissa had been established as a powerful prince on\r\ntheir borders. In such a situation future Roman intervention was\r\ninevitable. But for a generation Carthage was left in peace. A pro-Roman\r\nparty was in control there and bent all its energies to the peaceful\r\nrevival of Carthaginian commerce. And the Romans, after a period of\r\nsuspicion which ended with the exile of Hannibal in 196, regarded\r\nCarthaginian prosperity without enmity. However, this prosperity in the\r\nend led to the ruin of the city, for it awakened the envy of the Senate\r\nand the financial interests of Rome, which became only too ready to seize\r\nupon any excuse for the destruction of their ancient rival.\r\n\r\n*Cato and Carthage.* The opportunity came through the action of Masinissa.\r\nThis chieftain, knowing the restrictions imposed upon Carthage by her\r\ntreaty with Rome, and sensing the change in the Roman attitude towards\r\nthat city after 167 B. C., revived old claims to Carthaginian territory.\r\nCarthage could only appeal to Rome for protection, but in 161 and 157 the\r\nRoman commissions sent to adjust the disputes decided in favor of\r\nMasinissa. A member of the commission of 157 was the old Marcus Porcius\r\nCato, who was still obsessed with the fear which Carthage had inspired in\r\nhis youth, and who returned from his mission filled with alarm at the\r\nwealth of the city and henceforth devoted all his energies to accomplish\r\nits overthrow. In the following years he concluded all his speeches in the\r\nSenate with the words, “Carthage must be destroyed.”\r\n\r\n*The Roman ultimatum: 149 B. C.* A fresh attack by Masinissa occurred in\r\n151 B. C. Enraged, the Carthaginians took the field against him, but\r\nsuffered defeat. The Romans at once prepared for war. Conscious of having\r\noverstepped their rights and fearful of Roman vengeance, the Carthaginians\r\noffered unconditional submission in the hope of obtaining pardon. The\r\nSenate assured them of their lives, property and constitution, but\r\nrequired hostages and bade them execute the commands of the consuls who\r\ncrossed over to Africa with an army and ordered the Carthaginians to\r\nsurrender their arms and engines of war. The Carthaginians, desirous of\r\nappeasing the Romans at all costs, complied. Then came the ultimatum. They\r\nmust abandon their city and settle at least ten miles from the sea coast.\r\nThis was practically a death sentence to the ancient mercantile city.\r\nSeized with the fury of despair the Carthaginians improvised weapons and,\r\nmanning their walls, bade defiance to the Romans.\r\n\r\n*The siege of Carthage: 149–146 B. C.* For two years the Romans, owing to\r\nthe incapacity of their commanders, accomplished little. Then\r\ndisappointment and apprehension led the Roman people to demand as consul\r\nScipio Aemilianus, who had already distinguished himself as a military\r\ntribune. He was only a candidate for the aedileship and legally ineligible\r\nfor the consulate. But the restrictions upon his candidature were\r\nsuspended, and he was elected consul for 147 B. C. A special law entrusted\r\nhim with the conduct of the war in Africa. He restored discipline in the\r\nRoman army, defeated the Carthaginians in the field and energetically\r\npressed the siege of the city. The Carthaginians suffered frightfully from\r\nhunger and their forces were greatly reduced. In the spring of 146 B. C.\r\nthe Romans forced their way into the city and captured it after desperate\r\nfighting in the streets and houses. The handful of survivors were sold\r\ninto slavery, their city levelled to the ground and its site declared\r\naccursed. Out of the Carthaginian territory the Romans created a new\r\nprovince, called Africa. The last act in the dramatic struggle between the\r\ntwo cities was ended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    III. WAR WITH MACEDONIA AND THE ACHAEAN CONFEDERACY: 149–146 B. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n*The Fourth Macedonian War: 149–148 B. C.* The mutual rivalries among the\r\nGreek states, which frequently evoked senatorial intervention, and the\r\nill-will occasioned by the harshness of the Romans towards the anti-Roman\r\nparty everywhere, caused a large faction among the Hellenes to be ready to\r\nseize the first favorable opportunity for freeing Greece from Roman\r\nsuzerainty.\r\n\r\nRelying upon this antagonism to Rome, a certain Andriscus, who claimed to\r\nbe a son of Perseus, appeared in Macedonia in 149 and claimed the throne.\r\nHe made himself master of the country and defeated the first Roman forces\r\nsent against him. However, he was crushed in the following year at Pydna\r\nby the praetor Metellus, and Macedonia was recovered. The four republics\r\nwere not restored but the whole country was organized as a Roman province\r\n(148 B. C.).\r\n\r\n*The Achaeans assert their independence.* The Achaean Confederacy was one\r\nof the states where the feeling against Rome ran especially high. There\r\nthe irksomeness of the Roman protectorate was heightened by the return of\r\nthe survivors of the political exiles of 167, 300 in number. The\r\nanti-Roman party, supported by the extreme democratic elements in the\r\ncities, was in control of the Confederacy when border difficulties with\r\nSparta broke out afresh in 149 B. C. The matter was referred to the Senate\r\nfor settlement, but the Achaeans did not await its decision. They attacked\r\nand defeated Sparta, confident that the hands of the Romans were tied by\r\nthe wars in Spain, Africa and Macedonia.\r\n\r\n*The dissolution of the Confederacy: 146 B. C.* The Roman Senate\r\ndetermined to punish the Confederacy by detaching certain important cities\r\nfrom its membership. But in 147 the Achaean assembly tempestuously refused\r\nto carry out the orders of the Roman ambassadors, in spite of the fact\r\nthat the Macedonian revolt had been crushed. Their leaders, expecting no\r\nmercy from Rome, prepared for war and they were joined by the Boeotians\r\nand other peoples of central Greece. The next year they resolved to attack\r\nSparta, whereupon the Romans sent a fleet and an army against them under\r\nthe consul Lucius Mummius. Metellus, the conqueror of Macedonia, subdued\r\ncentral Greece and Mummius routed the forces of the Confederacy at\r\nLeucopetra on the Isthmus (146 B. C.). Corinth was sacked and burnt; its\r\ntreasures were carried off to Rome; and its inhabitants sold into slavery.\r\nIts land, like that of Carthage, was added to the Roman public domain.\r\nLike Alexander’s destruction of Thebes this was a warning which the other\r\ncities of Greece could not misinterpret. A senatorial commission dissolved\r\nthe Achaean Confederacy as well as the similar political combinations of\r\nthe Boeotians and Phocians, The cities of Greece entered into individual\r\nrelations with Rome. Those which had stood on the side of Rome, as Athens\r\nand Sparta, retained their previous status as Roman allies; the rest were\r\nmade subject and tributary. Greece was not organized as a province, but\r\nwas put under the supervision of the governor of Macedonia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       IV. THE ACQUISITION OF ASIA\r\n\r\n\r\n*The province of Asia.* In 133 B. C. died Attalus III, King of Pergamon,\r\nthe last of his line. In his will he made the Roman people the heir to his\r\nkingdom, probably with the feeling that otherwise disputes over the\r\nsuccession would end in Roman interference and conquest. The Romans\r\naccepted the inheritance but before they took possession a claimant\r\nappeared in the person of an illegitimate son of Eumenes II, one\r\nAristonicus. He occupied part of the kingdom, defeated and killed the\r\nconsul Crassus in 131, but was himself beaten and captured by the latter’s\r\nsuccessor Perpena in 129.\r\n\r\nOut of the kingdom of Pergamon there was then formed the Roman province of\r\nAsia (129 B. C.). The occupation of this country made Rome mistress of\r\nboth shores of the Aegean and gave her a convenient bridgehead for an\r\nadvance further eastward. The question of the financial administration of\r\nAsia and its relation to Roman politics will be discussed in a subsequent\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\n              THE ROMAN STATE AND THE EMPIRE: 265–133 B. C.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conquest of the hegemony of the Mediterranean world entailed the most\r\nserious consequences for the Roman state itself. Indeed, the wars which\r\nform the subject of the preceding chapters were the ultimate cause of the\r\ncrisis that led to the fall of the Roman Republic. In the present chapter\r\nit will be our task to trace the changes and indicate the problems that\r\nhad their origin in these wars and the ensuing conquests. Such a survey is\r\nbest begun by considering the character of the Roman government during the\r\nepoch in question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                I. THE RULE OF THE SENATORIAL ARISTOCRACY\r\n\r\n\r\n*The Senate’s control over the magistrates, tribunate, and assemblies.*\r\nFrom the passing of the Hortensian Law in 287 B. C. to the tribunate of\r\nTiberius Gracchus in 133 B. C. the Senate exercised a practically\r\nunchallenged control over the policy of the Roman state. For the Senate\r\nwas able to guide or nullify the actions of the magistrates, the\r\ntribunate, and the assemblies; a condition made possible by the\r\ncomposition of the Senate, which, in addition to the ex-magistrates,\r\nincluded all those above the rank of quaestor actually in office, and by\r\nthe peculiar organization and limitations of the Roman popular assemblies.\r\n\r\nThe higher magistrates were simply committees of senators elected by the\r\nassemblies. Their interests were those of the Senate as a whole, and\r\nconstitutional practice required them to seek its advice upon all matters\r\nof importance. The Senate assigned to the consuls and praetors their\r\nspheres of duty, appointed pro-magistrates and allotted them their\r\ncommands, and no contracts let by the censors were valid unless approved\r\nby the Senate. Except when the consuls were in the city, the Senate\r\ncontrolled all expenditures from the public treasury.\r\n\r\nThe chief weapon of the tribunes, their right of veto, which had been\r\ninstituted as a check upon the power of the Senate and the magistrates,\r\nbecame an instrument whereby the Senate bridled the tribunate itself. For,\r\nsince after 287 the plebeians speedily came to constitute a majority in\r\nthe senate chamber, it was not difficult for this body to secure the veto\r\nof the tribunes upon any measures of which it disapproved, whether they\r\noriginated with a consul or a tribune.\r\n\r\nAnd, because the popular assemblies could only vote upon such measures or\r\nfor such candidates as were submitted to them by the presiding\r\nmagistrates, the Senate through its influence over magistrates and\r\ntribunes controlled both the legislative and elective activities of the\r\ncomitia.\r\n\r\n*The Senate and the public policy.* Since the Senate was a permanent body,\r\neasily assembled and regularly summoned by the consuls to discuss all\r\nmatters of public concern, it was natural that the foreign policy of the\r\nstate should be entirely in its hands—subject, of course, to the right of\r\nthe Assembly of the Centuries to sanction the making of war or peace—and\r\nhence the organization and government of Rome’s foreign possessions became\r\na senatorial prerogative. And, likewise, it fell to the Senate to deal\r\nwith all sudden crises which constituted a menace to the welfare of the\r\nstate, like the spread of the Bacchanalian associations which was ended by\r\nthe _Senatus Consultum_ of 186 B. C. And, finally, the Senate claimed the\r\nright to proclaim a state of martial law by passing the so-called _Senatus\r\nConsultum ultimum_, a decree which authorized the magistrates to use any\r\nmeans whatsoever to preserve the state.\r\n\r\n*Polybius and the Roman Constitution.* Thus in spite of the fact that the\r\nGreek historian and statesman, Polybius, who was an intimate of the\r\ngoverning circles in Rome about the middle of the second century B. C., in\r\nlooking at the form of the Roman constitution could call it a nice balance\r\nbetween monarchy, represented by the consuls, aristocracy, represented by\r\nthe Senate, and democracy, represented by the tribunate and assemblies, in\r\nactual practice the state was governed by the Senate. It is true that the\r\nSenate was not always absolute master of the situation. Between 233 and\r\n217 B. C., the popular leader Caius Flaminius, as tribune, consul and\r\ncensor, was able to carry out a democratic policy at variance with the\r\nSenate’s wishes, but with his death the control of the Senate became\r\nfirmer than ever. From what has been said it will readily be seen that the\r\nSenate’s power rested mainly upon custom and precedent and upon the\r\nprestige and influence of itself as a whole and its individual members,\r\nnot upon powers guaranteed by law. The Roman republic never was a true\r\ndemocracy, but was strongly aristocratic in character.\r\n\r\n*The aristocracy of office.* The Senate was representative of a narrow\r\ncircle of wealthy patrician and plebeian families, which constituted the\r\nnew nobility that came into being with the cessation of the\r\npatricio-plebeian struggle and which was in truth an office-holding\r\naristocracy. For, after the initial widening of the circle of families\r\nenobled by admission to the Senate, the third century saw these create for\r\nthemselves a real, if not legal, monopoly of the magistracies and thus of\r\nthe regular gateway to the senate chamber. This they could do because the\r\nexpense involved in holding public offices, which were without salary, and\r\nin conducting the election campaigns, which became increasingly costly as\r\ntime went on, deterred all but persons of considerable fortune from\r\nseeking office, and because the exercise of personal influence and the\r\nright of the officer conducting an election to reject the candidature of a\r\nperson of whom he disapproved, made it possible to prevent in most cases\r\nthe election of any one not _persona grata_ to the majority of the\r\nsenators. It was only individuals of exceptional force and ability, like\r\nCato the Elder, and in later times Marius and Cicero, who could penetrate\r\nthe barriers thus established. Such a person was signalled as a _novus\r\nhomo_, a “new-comer.”\r\n\r\n*The goal of office.* While Rome was hard-pressed by her enemies and while\r\nthe issue of the struggle for world empire was still in doubt, the Senate\r\ndisplayed to a remarkable degree the qualities of self-sacrifice and\r\nsteadfastness which so largely contributed to Rome’s ultimate triumph, as\r\nwell as great political adroitness in the foreign relations of the state.\r\nBut with the passing of all external dangers, personal ambition and class\r\ninterest became more and more evident to the detriment of its patriotism\r\nand prestige. Office-holding, with the opportunities it offered for ruling\r\nover subject peoples and of commanding in profitable wars, became a ready\r\nmeans for securing for oneself and one’s friends the wealth which was\r\nneeded to maintain the new standard of luxurious living now affected by\r\nthe ruling class of the imperial city. The higher magistracies were\r\nrendered still more valuable in the eyes of the senators when the latter\r\nwere prohibited from participating directly in commercial ventures outside\r\nof Italy by a law passed in 219 B. C., which forbade senators to own ships\r\nof seagoing capacity, with the object probably of preventing the foreign\r\npolicy of the state from being directed by commercial interests. As a\r\nconsequence the rivalry for office became extremely keen, and the\r\ncustomary canvassing for votes tended to degenerate into bribery both of\r\nindividuals and of the voting masses. In the latter case it took the form\r\nof entertaining the public by the elaborate exhibition of lavish\r\nspectacles in the theatre and the arena.\r\n\r\n*Attempts to restrain abuses.* However, the sense of responsibility was\r\nstill strong enough in the Senate as a whole to secure the passing of\r\nlegislation designed to check this evil. The Villian law (_lex Villia\r\nannalis_) of 180 B. C. established a regular sequence for the holding of\r\nthe magistracies. Henceforth the quaestorship had to be held before the\r\npraetorship, and the latter before the consulate. The aedileship was not\r\nmade imperative, but was regularly sought after the quaestorship, because\r\nit involved the supervision of the public games and festivals, and in this\r\nway gave a good opportunity for ingratiating oneself with the populace.\r\nThe tribunate was not considered as one of the regular magistracies, and\r\nthe censorship, according to the custom previously established, followed\r\nthe consulship. The minimum age of twenty-eight years was set for the\r\nholding of the quaestorship, and an interval of two years was required\r\nbetween successive magistracies. Somewhat later, about 151 B. C.,\r\nre-elections to the same office were forbidden. In the years 181 and 159\r\nB. C. laws were passed which established severe penalties for the bribery\r\nof electors. Another attempt to check the same abuse was the introduction\r\nof the secret ballot for voting in the assemblies. The Gabinian Law of 139\r\nprovided for the use of the ballot in elections; two years later the\r\nCassian Law extended its use to trials in the _comitia_, and in 131 it was\r\nfinally employed in the legislative assemblies.\r\n\r\nBut these laws accomplished no great results, as they dealt merely with\r\nthe symptoms, and not with the cause of the disorder. And the Roman\r\nSenate, deteriorating in capacity and morale, was facing administrative,\r\nmilitary, and social problems, which might well have been beyond its power\r\nto solve even in the days of its greatness. As we have indicated the\r\nSenate’s power rested largely upon its successful foreign policy, but its\r\ninitial failures in the last wars with Macedonia and Carthage, and the\r\nlong and bloody struggles in Spain, had weakened its reputation and its\r\nclaim to control the public policy was challenged, from the middle of the\r\nsecond century B. C., by the new commercial and capitalist class.\r\n\r\n*The Roman Constitution from 265 to 133 B. C.* During the period in\r\nquestion there were few changes of importance in the political\r\norganization of the Roman state. The dictatorship had been discarded,\r\nalthough not abolished, before the close of the Hannibalic War, a step\r\nwhich was in harmony with the policy of the Senate which sought to prevent\r\nany official from attaining too independent a position. In 242 B. C. a\r\nsecond praetorship, the office of the _praetor peregrinus_ or alien\r\npraetor was established. The duty of this officer was to preside over the\r\ntrial of disputes arising between Roman citizens and foreigners. Two\r\nadditional praetorships were added in 227, and two more in 197 B. C., to\r\nprovide provincial governors of praetorian rank. In 241 B. C. the last two\r\nrural tribal districts were created, making thirty-five tribes in all.\r\nHereafter when new settlements of Roman colonists were undertaken, or new\r\npeoples admitted to citizenship, they were assigned to one or other of the\r\nold tribes, and membership therein became hereditary, irrespective of\r\nchange of residence.\r\n\r\n*The reform of the centuries.* At some time subsequent to the creation of\r\nthese last two tribes, very probably in the censorship of Flaminius in 220\r\nB. C., a change was made in the organization of the centuriate assembly.\r\nThe centuries were organized on the basis of the tribes, an equal number\r\nof centuries of juniors and seniors of each class being assigned to each\r\ntribe.(9) The reform was evidently democratic in its nature, as it\r\ndiminished the relative importance of the first class, deprived the\r\nequestrian centuries of the right of casting the first votes—a right now\r\nexercised by a century chosen by lot for each meeting—and placed in\r\ncontrol of the Assembly of the Centuries the same elements as controlled\r\nthe Assembly of the Tribes.\r\n\r\n*The comitia an antiquated institution.* But by the second century B. C.\r\nthe Roman primary assemblies had become antiquated as a vehicle for the\r\nexpression of the wishes of the majority of the Roman citizens, because\r\nwith the spread of the Roman citizen body throughout Italy it was\r\nimpossible for more than a small percentage to attend the meetings of the\r\nComitia, and this situation became much worse with the settlement of\r\nRomans in their foreign dependencies. It was the failure of the Romans to\r\ndevise some adequate substitute for this institution of a primitive\r\ncity-state, which was largely responsible for the people’s loss of its\r\nsovereign powers. As it was, the assemblies came to be dominated by the\r\nurban proletariat, a class absolutely unfitted to represent the Roman\r\ncitizens as a whole.\r\n\r\n*The allies of Rome in Italy.* The Latin and Italian allies, with the\r\nexception of such as were punished for their defection in the war with\r\nHannibal, remained in their previous federate relationship with Rome.\r\nHowever, the Romans were no longer careful to adhere strictly to their\r\ntreaty rights, and began to trespass upon the local independence of their\r\nallies. Roman magistrates did not hesitate to issue orders to the\r\nmagistrates of federate communities, and to punish them for failure to\r\nobey or for lack of respect. The spoils of war, furthermore, were no\r\nlonger divided in equal proportions between the Roman and allied troops.\r\nAdded to these aggravations came the fact that the allies were after all\r\ndependents and had no share in the government or the financial\r\nadministration of the lands they had helped to conquer. But their most\r\nserious grievance was their obligation to military service, which was\r\nexacted without relaxation, and which, owing to reasons which we shall\r\ndiscuss later, had become much more burdensome than when originally\r\nimposed. It is not surprising, then, to find that by 133 B. C. the\r\nfederate allies were demanding to be admitted to Roman citizenship.\r\n\r\nHowever, it was not in Rome or in Italy, but in Rome’s foreign possessions\r\nthat the important administrative development of the third and second\r\ncenturies occurred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 II. THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE PROVINCES\r\n\r\n\r\n*The status of the conquered peoples.* The acquisition of Sicily in 241,\r\nand of Sardinia and Corsica in 238 B. C. raised the question whether Rome\r\nshould extend to her non-Italian conquests the same treatment accorded to\r\nthe Italian peoples and include them within her military federation. This\r\nquestion was answered in the negative and the status of federate allies\r\nwas only accorded to such communities as had previously attained this\r\nrelationship or merited it by zeal in the cause of Rome. All the rest were\r\ntreated as subjects, not as allies, enjoying only such rights as the\r\nconquerors chose to leave them. The distinguishing mark of their condition\r\nwas their obligation to pay a tax or tribute to Rome. Except on special\r\noccasions they were not called upon to render military service.\r\n\r\n*The provinces.* At first the Romans tried to conduct the administration\r\nof Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica through the regular city magistrates, but\r\nfinding this unsatisfactory in 227 B. C. they created two separate\r\nadministrative districts—Sicily forming one, and the other two islands the\r\nsecond—called provinces from the word _provincia_, which meant the sphere\r\nof duty assigned to a particular official. And in fact special magistrates\r\nwere assigned to them, two additional praetors being annually elected for\r\nthis purpose. In like manner the Romans in 197 organized the provinces of\r\nHither and Farther Spain, in 148 the province of Macedonia, in 146 that of\r\nAfrica, and in 129 Asia. Subsequent conquests were treated in the same\r\nway. For the Spanish provinces new praetorships were created, “with\r\nconsular authority” because of the military importance of their posts. But\r\nfor those afterwards organized no new magistracies were added, and the\r\npractice was established of appointing as governor an ex-consul or\r\nex-praetor with the title of pro-consul or pro-praetor. This method of\r\nappointing provincial governors became, as we shall see, the rule for all\r\nprovinces under the republican régime.\r\n\r\n*The provincial charter.* Although each province had its own peculiar\r\nfeatures, in general all were organized and administered in the following\r\nway. A provincial charter (_lex provinciae_) drawn up on the ground by a\r\ncommission of ten senators and ratified by the Senate fixed the rights and\r\nobligations of the provincials. Each province was an aggregate of\r\ncommunities (_civitates_), enjoying city or tribal organization, which had\r\nno political bond of unity except in the representative of the Roman\r\nauthority. There were three classes of these communities: the free and\r\nfederate, the free and non-tributary, and the tributary (_civitates\r\nliberae et foederatae_, _liberae et immunes_, _stipendiariae_). The first\r\nwere few in number and although within the borders of a province did not\r\nreally belong to it, as they were free allies of Rome whose status was\r\nassured by a permanent treaty with the Roman state. The second class,\r\nlikewise not very numerous, enjoyed exemption from taxation by virtue of\r\nthe provincial charter, and this privilege the Senate could revoke at\r\nwill. The third group was by far the most numerous and furnished the\r\ntribute laid upon the province. As a rule each of the communities enjoyed\r\nits former constitution and laws, subject to the supervision of the Roman\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\n*The Roman governor.* Over this aggregate of communities stood the Roman\r\ngovernor and his staff. We have already seen how the governor was\r\nappointed and what was his rank among the Roman magistrates. His term of\r\noffice was regularly for one year, except in the Spanish provinces where a\r\nterm of two years was usual. His duties were of a threefold nature:\r\nmilitary, administrative, and judicial. He was in command of the Roman\r\ntroops stationed in the province for the maintenance of order and the\r\nprotection of the frontiers; he supervised the relations between the\r\ncommunities of his province and their internal administration, as well as\r\nthe collection of the tribute; he presided over the trial of the more\r\nserious cases arising among provincials, over all cases between\r\nprovincials and Romans, or between Roman citizens. Upon entering his\r\nprovince the governor published an edict, usually modelled upon that of\r\nhis predecessors or the praetor’s edict at Rome, stating what legal\r\nprinciples he would enforce during his term of office. The province was\r\ndivided into judicial circuits (_conventus_), and cases arising in each of\r\nthese were tried in designated places at fixed times.\r\n\r\n*The governor’s staff.* The governor was accompanied by a quaestor, who\r\nacted as his treasurer and received the provincial revenue from the tax\r\ncollectors. His staff also comprised three _legati_ or lieutenants,\r\nsenators appointed by the senate, but usually nominated by himself, whose\r\nfunction it was to assist him with their counsel and act as his deputies\r\nwhen necessary. He also took with him a number of companions (_comites_),\r\nusually young men from the families of his friends, who were given this\r\nopportunity of gaining a knowledge of provincial government and who could\r\nbe used in any official capacity. In addition, the governor brought his\r\nown retinue, comprising clerks and household servants.\r\n\r\n*The provincial taxes.* The taxes levied upon the provinces were at first\r\ndesigned to pay the expenses of occupation and defence. Hence they bore\r\nthe name _stipendium_, or soldiers’ pay. At a later date the provinces\r\nwere looked upon as the estates of the Roman people and the taxes as a\r\nform of rental. The term _tributum_ (tribute), used of the property tax\r\nimposed on Roman citizens did not come into general use for the provincial\r\nrevenues until a later epoch. As a rule the Romans accepted the tax system\r\nalready in vogue in each district before their occupancy, and exacted\r\neither a fixed annual sum from the province as in Spain, Africa and\r\nMacedonia or one tenth (_decuma_) of the annual produce of the soil, as in\r\nSicily and Asia. The tribute imposed by the Romans was not higher, but\r\nusually lower than what had been exacted by the previous rulers. The\r\npublic lands, mines, and forests, of the conquered state were incorporated\r\nin the Roman public domain, and the right to occupy or exploit them was\r\nleased to individuals or companies of contractors. Customs dues\r\n(_portoria_) were also collected in the harbors and on the frontiers of\r\nthe provinces.\r\n\r\n*The tax collectors.* Following the custom established in Italy, the Roman\r\nstate did not collect its taxes in the provinces through public officials\r\nbut leased for a period of five years the right to collect each particular\r\ntax to the private corporation of tax collectors (_publicani_) which made\r\nthe highest bid for the privilege. These corporations were joint stock\r\ncompanies, with a central office at Rome and agencies in the provinces in\r\nwhich they were interested. It was this system which was responsible for\r\nthe greatest evils of Roman provincial administration. For the _publicani_\r\nwere usually corporations of Romans, bent on making a profit from their\r\nspeculation, and practised under the guise of raising the revenue, all\r\nmanner of extortion upon the provincials. It was the duty of the governor\r\nto check their rapacity, but from want of sympathy with the oppressed and\r\nunwillingness to offend the Roman business interests this duty was rarely\r\nperformed. Hand in hand with tax collecting went the business of money\r\nlending, for the Romans found a state of chronic bankruptcy prevailing in\r\nthe Greek world and made loans everywhere at exorbitant rates of interest.\r\nTo collect overdue payments the Roman bankers appealed to the governor,\r\nwho usually quartered troops upon delinquent communities until they\r\nsatisfied their creditors.\r\n\r\n*The rapacity of the governors.* A further source of misgovernment lay in\r\nthe greed of the governor and his staff. The temptations of unrestricted\r\npower proved too great for the morality of the average Roman. It is true\r\nthat there were not wanting Roman governors who maintained the highest\r\ntraditions of Roman integrity in public office, but there were also only\r\ntoo many who abused their power to enrich themselves. While the shortness\r\nof his term of office prevented a good governor from thoroughly\r\nunderstanding the conditions of his province, it served to augment the\r\ncriminal zeal with which an avaricious proconsul, often heavily indebted\r\nfrom the expenses of his election campaigns, sought to wring a fortune\r\nfrom the hapless provincials. Bribes, presents, illegal exactions, and\r\nopen confiscations were the chief means of amassing wealth. In this the\r\nalmost sovereign position of the governor and his freedom from immediate\r\nsenatorial control guaranteed him a free hand.\r\n\r\n*The quaestio rerum repetundarum: 149 B. C.* The mischief became so\r\nserious that in 149 B. C. the public conscience awoke to the wrong and\r\nruin inflicted upon the provinces, and by a Calpurnian Law a standing\r\ncourt was instituted for the trial of officials accused of extortion in\r\nthe provinces. This court was composed of fifty jurors drawn from the\r\nSenate and was presided over by a praetor. From its judgment there was no\r\nappeal. Its establishment marks an important innovation in Roman legal\r\nprocedure in criminal cases. It is possible also that the Senate was\r\nencouraged to undertake the organization of new provinces shortly after\r\n149 because it believed that this court would serve as an adequate means\r\nof controlling the provincial governors. But it was useless to expect very\r\nmuch from such a tribunal. The cost of a long trial at Rome, the\r\ndifficulty of securing testimony, the inadequacy of the penalty provided,\r\nwhich was limited to restitution of the damage inflicted, as well as the\r\nfear of vengeance from future governors, would deter the majority of\r\nsufferers from seeking reparation. Nor could an impartial verdict be\r\nexpected from a jury of senators trying one of their own number for an\r\noffense which many of them regarded as their prerogative. And so till the\r\nend of the republic the provincials suffered from the oppression of their\r\ngovernors, as well as from that of the tax-collectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   III. SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT\r\n\r\n\r\n*Outstanding characteristics of the period.* The epoch of foreign\r\nexpansion which we are considering was marked by a complete revolution in\r\nthe social and economic life of Rome and Italy. It witnessed the spread of\r\nthe slave plantations, the decline of the free Italian peasantry, the\r\ngrowth of the city mob of Rome, the great increase in the power of the\r\ncommercial and capitalist class, and the introduction of a new standard of\r\nliving among the well-to-do.\r\n\r\n*The slave **plantations.* The introduction of the plantation system, that\r\nis, of the cultivation of large estates (_latifundia_) by slave labor, was\r\nthe result of several causes: the Roman system of administering the public\r\ndomain, the devastation of the rural districts of South Italy in the\r\nHannibalic War, the abundant supply of cheap slaves taken as prisoners of\r\nwar, and the inability of the small proprietors to maintain themselves in\r\nthe face of the demands of military service abroad and the competition of\r\nimported grain as well as that of the _latifundia_ themselves.\r\n\r\nThe public domain that was not required for purposes of colonization had\r\nalways been open for pasturage or cultivation to persons paying a nominal\r\nrental to the state. Those who profited most from this system were the\r\nwealthier landholders who could occupy and cultivate very considerable\r\nareas. This fact explains the senatorial opposition to the division and\r\nsettlement of the _ager Gallicus_ proposed and carried by the tribune\r\nFlaminius in 233 B. C. The dangers of the practice to the smaller\r\nproprietors caused the passing of laws, probably late in the third\r\ncentury, which limited the amount of public land to be occupied by any\r\nindividual and his family. But these laws were disregarded, for the Senate\r\nadministered the public domain and the senators were the wealthy\r\nlandholders. After several generations the public lands occupied in this\r\nway came to be regarded as private property. The havoc wrought by Hannibal\r\nin South Italy, where he destroyed four hundred communities, caused the\r\ndisappearance of the country population and opened the way for the\r\nacquisition of large estates there, and the law which restricted the\r\ncommercial activities of senators and forbade their engaging in tax\r\ncollecting or undertaking similar state contracts encouraged them to\r\ninvest their capital in Italian land and stimulated the growth of their\r\nholdings.\r\n\r\nThe change in agrarian conditions in Italy was also advantageous to large\r\nestates. The cheapness of Sicilian grain rendered it more profitable in\r\nItaly to cultivate vineyards and olive orchards, and to raise cattle and\r\nsheep on a large scale. For the latter wide acreages were needed: a summer\r\npasturage in the mountains and a winter one in the lowlands of the coast.\r\nAbundant capital and cheap labor were other requisites. And slaves were to\r\nbe had in such numbers that their labor was exploited without regard for\r\ntheir lives. Cato the Elder, who exemplified the vices as well as the\r\nvirtues of the old Roman character, treated his slaves like cattle and\r\nrecommended that they be disposed of when no longer fit for work. Often\r\nthe slaves worked in irons, and were housed in underground prisons\r\n(_ergastula_). The dangers of the presence of such masses of slaves so\r\nbrutally treated came to light in the Sicilian Slave War which broke out\r\nin 136 B. C., when over 200,000 of them rebelled and defied the Roman arms\r\nfor a period of four years.\r\n\r\n*The decline of the free peasantry.* Partly a cause and partly a result of\r\nthe spread of the _latifundia_ was the decline of the free Italian\r\npeasantry. As we have seen, the competition of the slave plantations\r\nproved ruinous to those who tilled their own land. But another very potent\r\ncause contributing to this result was the burden imposed by Rome’s foreign\r\nwars. Since only those who had a property assessment of at least 4000\r\nasses were liable to military service, and since the majority of Roman\r\ncitizens were engaged in agricultural occupations, the Roman armies were\r\nchiefly recruited from the country population. And no longer for a part of\r\neach year only, but for a number of consecutive years, was the peasant\r\nsoldier kept from his home to the inevitable detriment of his fields and\r\nhis finances. Furthermore, a long period of military service with the\r\nchances of gaining temporary riches from the spoils of war unfitted men\r\nfor the steady, laborious life of the farm. And so many discharged\r\nsoldiers, returning to find that their lands had been mortgaged in their\r\nabsence for the support of their families, and being unable or unwilling\r\nto gain a livelihood on their small estates, let these pass into the hands\r\nof their wealthier neighbors and flocked to Rome to swell the mob of\r\nidlers there. Then came the heavy losses of the Second Punic and the\r\nSpanish Wars. Although the census list of Roman citizens eligible for\r\nmilitary service shows an increase in the first half of the second century\r\nB. C., between 164 and 136 it sank from 337,000 to 317,000. Yet the levies\r\nhad to be raised, even if, as we have seen, they were unpopular enough to\r\ninduce the tribunes to intercede against them. The Latin and Italian\r\nallies felt the same drain as the Roman citizens, but had no recourse to\r\nthe tribunician intercession. The Senate was consequently brought face to\r\nface with a very serious military problem. The provinces, once occupied,\r\nhad to be kept in subjection and defended. Since the Roman government\r\nwould not, or dare not, raise armies in the provinces, it had to meet\r\nincreasing military obligations with declining resources.\r\n\r\n*The urban proletariat.* Another difficulty was destined to arise from the\r\ngrowth of a turbulent mob in Rome itself. This was in large measure due to\r\nRome’s position as the political and commercial center of the\r\nMediterranean world. By the end of this period of expansion the city had a\r\npopulation of at least half a million, rivalling Alexandria and Antioch,\r\nthe great Hellenistic capitals. Although not a manufacturing city, Rome\r\nhad always been important as a market, and now her streets were thronged\r\nwith traders from all lands, and with persons who could cater in any way\r\nto the wants and the appetites of an imperial city. There was a large\r\nproportion of slaves belonging to the mansions of the wealthy, and of\r\nfreedmen engaged in business for themselves or for their patrons. Hither\r\nflocked also the peasants who for various reasons had abandoned their\r\nagricultural pursuits to pick up a precarious living in the city or to\r\ndepend upon the bounty of the patron to whom they attached themselves.\r\nOwing to the slowness of transportation by land and its uncertainties by\r\nsea, the congestion of population in Rome made the problem of supplying\r\nthe city with food one of great difficulty, since a rise in the price of\r\ngrain, or a delay in the arrival of the Sicilian wheat convoy would bring\r\nthe proletariat to the verge of starvation. And upon the popular\r\nassemblies the presence of this unstable element had an unwholesome\r\neffect. Dominated as these assemblies were by those who resided in the\r\ncity, their actions were bound to be determined by the particular\r\ninterests and passions of this portion of the citizen body. Furthermore,\r\nin the _contiones_ or mass meetings for political purposes, non-citizens\r\nas well as citizens could attend, and this afforded a ready means for\r\nevoking the mob spirit in the hope of overawing the Comitia. This danger\r\nwould not have been present if the Roman constitution had provided\r\nadequate means for policing the city. As it was, however, beyond the\r\nmagistrates and their personal attendants, there were no persons\r\nauthorized to maintain order in the city. And since the consuls lacked\r\nmilitary authority within the _pomerium_, there were no armed forces at\r\ntheir disposal.\r\n\r\n*The equestrian order.* The Roman custom of depending as much as possible\r\nupon individual initiative for the conduct of public business, as in the\r\nconstruction of roads, aqueducts and other public works, the operation of\r\nmines, and the collection of taxes of all kinds, had given rise to a class\r\nof professional public contractors—the _publicani_. Their operations, with\r\nthe allied occupations of banking and money-lending, had been greatly\r\nenlarged by the period of war and conquest which followed 265 B. C.\r\nthrough the opportunities it brought for the exploitation of subject\r\npeoples. Roman commerce, too, had spread with the extension of Roman\r\npolitical influence. The exclusion of senators from direct participation\r\nin these ventures led to the rise of a numerous, wealthy and influential\r\nclass whose interests differed from and often ran counter to those of the\r\nsenatorial order. In general they supported an aggressive foreign policy,\r\nwith the ruthless exploitation of conquered peoples, and they were\r\npowerful enough to influence the destruction of Carthage and Corinth. In\r\nthe course of the second century this class developed into a distinct\r\norder in the state—the equestrians. Since the Roman cavalry had\r\npractically ceased to serve in the field, the term _equites_ came to be\r\napplied to all those whose property would have permitted their serving as\r\ncavalry at their own expense. The majority of these was formed by the\r\nbusiness class, although under the name of equestrians were still included\r\nsuch members of the senatorial families as had not yet held office.\r\n\r\n*The new scale of living.* In the course of their campaigns in Sicily,\r\nAfrica, Greece, and Asia Minor, the Romans came into close contact with a\r\ncivilization older and higher than their own, where the art of living was\r\npractised with a refinement and elegance unknown in Latium. In this\r\nrespect the conquerors showed themselves only too ready to learn from the\r\nconquered, and all the luxurious externals of culture were transplanted to\r\nRome. But the old Periclean motto, “refinement without extravagance,” did\r\nnot appeal to the Romans who, like typical _nouveaux riches_ vied with one\r\nanother in the extravagant display of their wealth. The simple Roman house\r\nwith its one large _atrium_, serving at once as kitchen, living room, and\r\nbed chamber, was completely transformed. The _atrium_ became a pillared\r\nreception hall, special rooms were added for the various phases of\r\ndomestic life; in the rear of the _atrium_ arose a Greek peristyle\r\ncourtyard, and the house was filled with costly sculptures and other works\r\nof art, plundered or purchased in the cities of Hellas. Banquets were\r\nserved on silver plate and exhibited the rarest and costliest dishes. The\r\nhomes of the wealthy were thronged with retinues of slaves, each specially\r\ntrained for some particular task; the looms of the East supplied garments\r\nof delicate texture. A wide gulf yawned between the life of the rich and\r\nthe life of the poor.\r\n\r\n*Sumptuary legislation.* But the change did not come about without\r\nvigorous opposition from the champions of the old Roman simplicity of life\r\nwho saw in the new refinement and luxury a danger to Roman vigor and\r\nmorality. The spokesman of the reactionaries was Cato the Elder, who in\r\nhis censorship in 184 B. C. assessed articles of luxury and expensive\r\nslaves at ten times their market value and made them liable to taxation at\r\nan exceptionally high rate, in case the property tax should be levied. But\r\nsuch action was contrary to the spirit of the age; the next censors let\r\nhis regulations fall into abeyance. Attempts to check the growth of luxury\r\nby legislation were equally futile. The Oppian Law, passed under stress of\r\nthe need for conservation in 215 B. C., restricting female extravagance in\r\ndress and ornaments, was repealed in 195, and subsequent attempts at\r\nsumptuary legislation in 181, 161, and 143, were equally in vain.\r\n\r\nTo resume: in 133 B. C. the Roman state was faced with a bitter contest\r\nbetween the Senate and the equestrians for the control of the government,\r\nthe Comitia was dominated by an unstable urban proletariat, the\r\nprovisioning of Rome was a source of anxiety, dissatisfaction was rife\r\namong the Latin and Italian allies, the military resources of the state\r\nwere weakening, while its military burdens were greater than ever, and the\r\nruling circles had begun to display unmistakable signs of a declining\r\npublic morality. With a constitution adapted to a city-state Rome was now\r\nforced to grapple with all the problems of imperial government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          IV. CULTURAL PROGRESS\r\n\r\n\r\n*Greek influences.* In addition to creating new administrative problems\r\nand transforming the economic life of Italy, the expansion of Rome gave a\r\ntremendous impulse to its cultural development. The chief stimulus thereto\r\nwas the close contact with Hellenic civilization. We have previously\r\nmentioned that Rome had been subject to Greek influences both indirectly\r\nthrough Etruria and directly from the Greek cities of South Italy, but\r\nwith the conquest of the latter, and the occupation of Sicily, Greece, and\r\npart of Asia Minor, these influences became infinitely more immediate and\r\npowerful. They were intensified by the number of Greeks who flocked to\r\nRome as ambassadors, teachers, physicians, merchants and artists, and by\r\nthe multitude of educated Greek slaves employed in Roman households. And\r\nas the Hellenic civilization was more ancient and had reached a higher\r\nstage than the Latin, it was inevitable that the latter should borrow\r\nlargely from the former and consciously or unconsciously imitate it in\r\nmany respects. In fact the intellectual life of Rome never attained the\r\nfreedom and richness of that of Greece upon which it was always dependent.\r\nIn this domain, as Horace phrased it, “Captive Greece took captive her\r\nrude conqueror.”\r\n\r\n*New tendencies in Roman education.* A knowledge of Greek now became part\r\nof the equipment of every educated man, the training of the sons of the\r\nwell-to-do was placed in the hands of Greek tutors, who were chiefly\r\ndomestic slaves, and the study of the masterpieces of Greek literature\r\ncreated the genuine admiration for Greek achievements and the respect that\r\nmen like Flamininus showed towards their Greek contemporaries—a respect\r\nwhich the political ineptitude of the latter soon changed to contempt.\r\nThese tendencies were vigorously opposed by the conservative Cato, who\r\nregarded Greek influences as demoralizing. Following the old Roman custom\r\nhe personally trained his sons, and had no sympathy with a philhellenic\r\nforeign policy. But even Cato in the end yielded so far as to learn Greek.\r\nThe chief patrons of Hellenism were men of the type of Scipio Africanus\r\nthe Elder; notably Titus Flamininus, Aemilius Paulus and Scipio\r\nAemilianus, at whose house gathered the leading intellectuals of the day.\r\nIntimate associates there were the Achaean historian Polybius and the\r\nStoic philosopher Panaetius of Rhodes.\r\n\r\n*Roman literature: I. Poetry.* More than anything else Greek influences\r\ncontributed to the rise of Roman literature. Prior to the war with\r\nHannibal the Romans had no literature, although Latin prose had attained a\r\ncertain development in the formulation of laws and treaties and a rude\r\nLatin verse had appeared.\r\n\r\nNot unnaturally Roman literature began with translations from the Greek,\r\nand here poetry preceded prose. In the latter half of the third century\r\nB. C., Livius Andronicus, a Greek freedman, translated the _Odyssey_ into\r\nLatin Saturnian verse, as a text-book for school use. He also translated\r\nGreek comedies and tragedies. At about the same time Cnaeus Naevius wrote\r\ncomedies and tragedies having Roman as well as Greek subjects. He also\r\ncomposed an epic poem on the First Punic War, still using the native\r\nSaturnian.\r\n\r\nDramatic literature developed rapidly under the demand for plays to be\r\npresented at the public festivals. In the second century appeared the\r\ngreat comic poet Plautus, who drew his subjects from the Greek New Comedy,\r\nbut whose metre and language were strictly Latin. He was followed by\r\nTerence, a man of lesser genius, who depended largely upon Greek\r\noriginals, but who was distinguished for the purity and elegance of his\r\nLatin. A later dramatist of note was Lucius Accius, who brought Roman\r\ntragedy to its height. In both comedy and tragedy Greek plots and\r\ncharacters were gradually abandoned for those of native origin, but\r\ntragedy failed to appeal to the Roman public which was in general too\r\nuneducated to appreciate its worth and preferred the comedy, mime or\r\ngladiatorial combat. A notable figure is Ennius, a Messapian, who began to\r\nwrite at the close of the third century B. C. He created the Latin\r\nhexameter verse in which he wrote a great epic portraying the history of\r\nRome from the migration of Aeneas. Another famous member of the Scipionic\r\ncircle was Gaius Lucilius, a Roman of equestrian rank, who originated the\r\none specifically Roman contribution to literary types, the satire. His\r\npoems were a criticism of life in all its aspects, public and private. He\r\ncalled them “talks” (_sermones_), but they received the popular name of\r\nsatires because their colloquial language and the variety of their\r\nsubjects recalled the native Italian medley of prose and verse, narrative\r\nand drama, known as the _satura_.\r\n\r\n*II. Prose.* Latin prose developed more slowly. The earliest Roman\r\nhistorical works by Fabius Pictor (after 201 B. C.), Cincius Alimentus,\r\nand others, were written in Greek, for in that language alone could they\r\nfind suitable models. It remained for Cato, here as elsewhere the foe of\r\nHellenism, to create Latin historical prose in his _Origins_, an account\r\nof the beginnings of Rome and the Italian peoples written about 168 B. C.\r\nHis earlier work on agriculture was the first book in Latin prose. The\r\nwork of the Carthaginian Mago on the same subject was translated into\r\nLatin by a commission appointed by the Senate.\r\n\r\n*Oratory.* The demands of public life in Rome had already created a native\r\noratory. A speech delivered by Appius Claudius in 279 B. C. had been\r\nwritten down and published, as were several funeral orations from the\r\nclose of the third century. But it was Cato who first published a\r\ncollection of his speeches, about one hundred and fifty in number, which\r\nenjoyed a great reputation. A new impulse to this branch of literature was\r\ngiven by the introduction of the systematic study of rhetoric under the\r\ninfluence of Greek orators and teachers.\r\n\r\n*Juristic writings.* In the field of jurisprudence the Romans at this\r\nperiod, were but little subject to Greek influences. The codification of\r\nthe law in the fifth century B. C. had been followed by the introduction\r\nof new principles and forms of action, chiefly through the praetor’s\r\nedict. The necessity arose of harmonizing the old law and the new, and of\r\nsystematizing the various forms of legal procedure. Roman juristic\r\nliterature begins with Sextus Aelius Paetus (consul in 198 B. C.),\r\nsurnamed Catus “the shrewd,” who compiled a work which later generations\r\nregarded as “the cradle of the law.” It was in three parts; the first\r\ncontained an interpretation of the XII Tables, the second the development\r\nof the law by the jurists, and the third new methods of legal procedure. A\r\nknowledge of the law had always been highly esteemed at Rome and the\r\nposition of a jurist consult, that is, one who was consulted on difficult\r\nlegal problems, was one of especial honor. Consequently the study of the\r\nlaw, together with that of oratory, formed the regular preparation for the\r\nRoman who aimed at a public career.\r\n\r\n*Religion.* Greek religion, like Greek literature, had attained a more\r\nadvanced stage than that of Rome, and possessed a rich mythology when the\r\nRomans had barely begun to ascribe distinct personalities to their gods.\r\nHence there came about a ready identification between Greek and Roman\r\ndivinities to whom similar powers were ascribed and the wholesale adoption\r\nof Greek mythological lore. By the close of the third century B. C. there\r\nwas formally recognized in Rome a group of twelve greater divinities who\r\nwere identical with the twelve Olympic gods of Greece. There ensued also a\r\nrapid neglect of the minor Latin divinities whose place was taken by those\r\nof Greek origin. The old impersonal Roman deities had given place to\r\nanthropomorphic Hellenic conceptions. This is reflected in the acceptance\r\nof Greek types for the plastic representations of the gods, a strong\r\ndemand for which arose with the acquaintance of the works of art carried\r\noff from Syracuse and other Greek cities. An important factor in this\r\nhellenization of the Roman religion was the influence of the Sibylline\r\nBooks, a collection of Greek oracles imported from Cumae in the days of\r\nthe Roman kings and consulted in times of national danger.\r\n\r\n*The decree of the Senate against Bacchanalian societies: 186 B. C.* But\r\nGreek influence in the sphere of religion went deeper than the\r\nidentification of Greek and Roman divinities, for the emotional cult of\r\nBacchus with its mystic ceremonies and doctrines made its way into Italy\r\nwhere religious associations for its celebration were formed even in Rome\r\nitself. The demoralizing effects of this worship called forth a senatorial\r\ninvestigation which resulted, as we have seen, in the suppression of these\r\nassociations. A similar action was taken with regard to the Chaldean\r\nastrologers, banished from Italy in 139 B. C.\r\n\r\n*The worship of the Great Mother.* Of a different character was the cult\r\nof the Great Mother officially introduced into Rome in the year 204 B. C.\r\nThis was in essence a native nature worship of Asia Minor, disguised with\r\na veneer of Hellenism. It was the first of the so-called Oriental cults to\r\nobtain a footing in the Roman world.\r\n\r\n*Skepticism and Stoicism.* Although the formalities of religion in so far\r\nas they concerned public life were still scrupulously observed, there was\r\nan ever increasing skepticism with regard to the existence and power of\r\nthe gods of the Graeco-Roman mythology. This was especially true of the\r\neducated classes, who were influenced to a certain extent by the\r\nrationalism of Euhemerus, whose work on the origin of the gods had been\r\ntranslated by Ennius, but much more by the pantheism of the Stoic\r\nphilosophy. The Stoic doctrines, with their practical ethical\r\nprescriptions, made a strong appeal to the Roman character and found an\r\nable expositor in Panaetius of Rhodes who taught under the patronage of\r\nScipio Aemilianus.\r\n\r\n*Public festivals.* Of great importance in the life of the city were the\r\nannual public festivals or games, of which six came to be regularly\r\ncelebrated by the middle of the second century, each lasting for several\r\ndays. Five of these were celebrated by the aediles, one by the city\r\npraetor. A fixed sum was allotted by the state to defray the expenses of\r\nthese exhibits, but custom required that this must be largely supplemented\r\nfrom the private purse of the person in charge. In this way the aedileship\r\nafforded an excellent opportunity to win public favor by an exhibition of\r\ngenerosity. To the original horse and chariot races there came to be added\r\nscenic productions, wild beast hunts, and gladiatorial combats, in\r\nimitation of those exhibited by private persons. The first private\r\nexhibition of gladiators was given at a funeral in 264 B. C., and the\r\nfirst wild beast hunt in 186 B. C. These types of exhibitions soon became\r\nthe most popular of all and exercised a brutalizing effect upon the\r\nspectators.\r\n\r\n*The city Rome.* The growth of Rome in population and wealth brought about\r\na corresponding change in the appearance of the city. Tenement houses of\r\nseveral stories and high rentals reflected the influx into the capital.\r\nPublic buildings began to be erected on a large scale. The Circus\r\nFlaminius dates from the end of the third century, and several basilicas\r\nor large public halls, suitable as places for transacting business or\r\nconducting judicial hearings, were erected by 169 B. C. A new stone bridge\r\nwas built across the Tiber, a quay to facilitate the unloading of ships\r\nwas constructed on the bank of the river, a third aqueduct brought into\r\nthe city, and stone paving laid on many streets. Many temples were\r\nerected, adorned with votive offerings, mainly spoils of war from Greek\r\ncities. But no native art or architecture arose that was worthy of the\r\nimperial position of Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\n      THE STRUGGLE OF THE OPTIMATES AND THE POPULARES: 133–78 B. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Civil war and imperial expansion.* The century which began with the year\r\n133 B. C. is characterized by a condition of perpetual factional strife\r\nwithin the Roman state; strife which frequently blazed forth into civil\r\nwar and which culminated in the fall of the republican system of\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThe question at issue was the right of the Senate to direct the policy of\r\nRome, and this right was challenged by the tribunate and the Assembly of\r\nTribes, by the equestrian order, and by the great military leaders who\r\nappeared in the course of civil and foreign wars.\r\n\r\nFor in spite of these unceasing internal disorders this century marks an\r\nimperial expansion which rivalled that of the era of the Punic and\r\nMacedonian Wars. In Gaul the Roman sway was extended to the Rhine and the\r\nOcean; in the east practically the whole peninsula of Asia Minor, as well\r\nas Syria and Egypt, was incorporated in the Empire. With the exception of\r\nMauretania (i. e. modern Morocco, which was really a Roman dependency) the\r\nRoman provinces completely encircled the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nAt the same time a new Italian nation was created by the admission to\r\nRoman citizenship of all the peoples dwelling in Italy south of the Alps.\r\n\r\nThe period 133 to 78 B. C. covers the first stage in the struggle which\r\nbrought the Republic to an end, and closes with the Senate in full\r\npossession of its old prerogatives, while the powers of the tribunate and\r\nAssembly have been seriously curtailed. In this struggle the Roman citizen\r\nbody was aligned in two groups. The one, which supported the claims of the\r\nSenate, was called the party of the “Optimates” or aristocrats; the other,\r\nwhich challenged these claims, was known as the people’s party or the\r\n“Populares.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n           I. THE AGRARIAN LAWS OF TIBERIUS GRACCHUS: 133 B. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Tiberius Gracchus, tribune, 133 B. C.* The opening of the struggle was\r\nbrought on by the agrarian legislation proposed by Tiberius Gracchus, a\r\ntribune for the year 133 B. C. Gracchus, then thirty years of age, was one\r\nof the most prominent young Romans of his time, being the son of the\r\nconsul whose name he bore and of Cornelia, daughter of the great Scipio\r\nAfricanus. Under his mother’s supervision, he had received a careful\r\neducation, which included rhetoric and Greek Stoic philosophy. As quaestor\r\nin Spain in 136 he had distinguished himself for courage and honesty in\r\ndealing with the native population and had acquainted himself with the\r\nmilitary needs of Rome. He saw in the decline of the free peasantry of\r\nItaly the chief menace to the state, and when elected to the tribunate\r\nproposed legislation which aimed to re-establish the class of free Roman\r\nfarmers, and thus provide new strength for the Roman armies.\r\n\r\n*The land law.* His proposed land law took the form of a re-enactment of a\r\nprevious agrarian measure dating, probably, from the end of the third\r\ncentury B. C. This law had restricted the amount of public land which any\r\nperson might occupy to five hundred iugera (about three hundred and ten\r\nacres), an amount which Gracchus augmented by two hundred and fifty iugera\r\nfor each of two grown sons. All land held in excess of this limit was to\r\nbe surrendered to the state, further occupation of public land was\r\nforbidden, and what was within the legal limit was to be declared private\r\nproperty. Compensation for improvements on surrendered lands was offered\r\nto the late occupants, and a commission of three men was to be annually\r\nelected with judicial powers to decide upon the rights of possessors (_III\r\nvir agris iudicandis assignandis_). The land thus resumed by the state was\r\nto be assigned by the commissioners to landless Roman citizens in small\r\nallotments, incapable of alienation, and subject to a nominal rental to\r\nthe state.\r\n\r\n*Deposition of the tribune Octavius.* This proposal aroused widespread\r\nconsternation among the Senators, who saw their holdings threatened. In\r\nmany cases it had doubtless become impossible for them to distinguish\r\nbetween their private properties and the public lands occupied by their\r\nfamilies for several generations. The Senate resorted to its customary\r\nprocedure in protecting its prerogatives and induced a tribune named\r\nOctavius to veto the measure. But Gracchus was terribly in earnest with\r\nhis project of reform and took the unprecedented step of appealing to the\r\nAssembly of the Tribes to depose Octavius, on the ground that he was\r\nthwarting the will of the people. The Assembly voiced their approval of\r\nTiberius by depriving his opponent of his office. The land bill was\r\nthereupon presented to the Assembly and passed. The first commissioners\r\nelected to carry it into effect were Tiberius himself, his younger brother\r\nCaius, and his father-in-law, Appius Claudius.\r\n\r\n*Death of Tiberius Gracchus.* To equip the allotments made to poor\r\nsettlers, Tiberius proposed the appropriation of the treasure of King\r\nAttalus III of Pergamon, to which the Roman state had lately fallen heir.\r\nHere was a direct attack upon the Senate’s customary control of such\r\nmatters. But before this proposal could be presented to the Comitia, the\r\nelections to the tribunate for 132 fell due. Tiberius determined to\r\npresent himself for re-election in order to ensure the carrying out of his\r\nland law and to protect himself from prosecution on the ground of the\r\nunconstitutionality of some of his actions. Such a procedure was unusual,\r\nif not illegal, and the Senate determined to prevent it at any cost. The\r\nelections culminated in a riot in which Gracchus and three hundred\r\nadherents were massacred by the armed slaves and clients of the senators.\r\nTheir bodies were thrown into the Tiber. A judicial commission appointed\r\nby the Senate sought out and punished the leading supporters of the\r\nmurdered tribune.\r\n\r\n*The fate of the land commission.* However, the land law remained in force\r\nand the commission set to work. But in 129 B. C. the commissioners were\r\ndeprived of their judicial powers, and, since they could no longer\r\nexpropriate land, their activity practically ceased.\r\n\r\nStill, the Senate’s opponents were not utterly crushed. In 131 an attempt\r\nwas made to legalize re-election to the tribunate, and although the\r\nproposal failed at first, a law to that effect was passed some time prior\r\nto 123 B. C. In the year 129 died Scipio Aemilianus, the conqueror of\r\nCarthage and Numantia, the foremost Roman of the day. Upon returning from\r\nSpain in 132 he had energetically taken sides with the Senate and had\r\ncaused the land commissioners to lose their right of jurisdiction. Thereby\r\nhe had become exceedingly unpopular with the Gracchan party, and when he\r\ndied suddenly in his fifty-sixth year, there were not wanting those who\r\naccused his wife Sempronia, sister of Tiberius and Caius Gracchus, and\r\nothers of their family, of being responsible for his decease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            II. THE TRIBUNATE OF CAIUS GRACCHUS: 124–121 B. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Caius Gracchus, tribune, 123 B. C.* The return of Caius Gracchus from his\r\nquaestorship in Sardinia in 124 B. C. and his immediate election to the\r\ntribunate for the ensuing year heralded the opening of a new phase in the\r\nconflict between the Optimates and the Populares. Caius was a passionate\r\norator, and a man of greater energy and more violent temperament than his\r\nbrother. He entered office pledged to support the agrarian policy of\r\nTiberius, but likewise determined to avenge the latter’s death and to\r\nwrest from the Senate its control of the government.\r\n\r\n*The legislation of Caius Gracchus, 123 B. C.* Upon assuming office Caius\r\ndeveloped an extensive legislative program. Extraordinary judicial\r\ncommissions established by the Senate were declared illegal and the\r\nex-consul Popilius who had been the leader in the prosecution of the\r\nfollowers of Tiberius, was forced into exile. A law was passed which\r\nprovided for a monthly distribution of grain to the city populace at one\r\nhalf the current market price. In this way an expedient which had\r\noccasionally been resorted to in times of distress was laid as a permanent\r\nobligation upon the government. It has been pointed out above that the\r\nlower classes in the city lived in perpetual danger of famine, and Caius\r\nprobably hoped to relieve the state of the perpetual menace of a hungry\r\nproletariat at the capital by improving the arrangements for the city’s\r\ngrain supply and lowering the cost of grain to the poor. But in the end\r\nthis measure had the evil results of putting a severe drain upon the\r\ntreasury and a premium upon idleness. For the moment, however, it made the\r\ncity mob devoted adherents of Caius and strengthened his control of the\r\nAssembly. The land law of 133 B. C. was re-enacted and the land\r\ncommissioners reclothed with judicial authority. In connection therewith\r\nthere was undertaken the extension and improvement of the road system of\r\nItaly. Caius then assured himself of the support of the financial\r\ninterests by a law which provided that the whole revenue from the new\r\nprovince of Asia should be auctioned off at Rome in a lump to Roman\r\ncontractors. A rich field was thus opened up to the Roman bankers.\r\n\r\n*Caius re-elected tribune for 122 B. C.* The activity of Caius in\r\nsupervising the execution of his legislation made him the leading figure\r\nin the government, and he was re-elected to the tribunate for 122 B. C. It\r\nseemed as though a sort of Periclean democracy had been established in\r\nRome, where the statesman who commanded a majority in the popular assembly\r\nby securing his continuous re-election to the tribunate might supplant the\r\nSenate in directing the public policy.\r\n\r\n*The Judiciary Law, 123 B. C.* Gracchus continued his legislative\r\nactivity. One of his most important laws was that which deprived senators\r\nof the right to act as judges in the courts, including the permanent\r\n_quaestiones_, and transferred this prerogative to the equestrians. This\r\nwas probably done by defining the qualifications of jurors in such a way\r\nas to exclude both senators and those not potentially able to maintain the\r\nequipment of a cavalryman at their own expense, i. e. those assessed at\r\nless than 400,000 sesterces ($20,000). By the Acilian Law of 123, which\r\nreorganized the _quaestio_ for the recovery of damages, the relatives of\r\nsenators, who were still eligible to the eighteen equestrian centuries,\r\nwere specifically excluded from serving as jurors. In this way the\r\nequestrian order in its widest sense was defined and, being given specific\r\npublic duties, was rendered more conscious of its power and special\r\ninterests. In consequence the permanent tribunal for trying officials\r\ncharged with extortion in the provinces was manned by _equites_ instead of\r\nsenators. But the change brought no relief to the subjects of Rome for\r\nthis court was now composed of men who were interested in the financial\r\nexploitation of the provincials and who thus were in a position to\r\nintimidate a governor who endeavored to restrain the rapacity of tax\r\ncollectors and money-lenders. The control of the law courts became a\r\nstanding bone of contention between the Senate and the equestrian order.\r\nAnother law, which further restricted the powers of the Senate, dealt with\r\nthe allotment of the consular provinces. Previously these had been\r\nassigned by the Senate after the election of the consuls, so that the\r\nactivities of one distrusted by the senators could be considerably\r\nrestricted. For the future the consular provinces had to be designated\r\nprior to the elections and then assigned to the successful candidates. The\r\nSenate’s control over the consuls was thereby considerably weakened.\r\n\r\n*Schemes for **colonization** and **extension** of Roman **citizenship**.*\r\nCaius also secured the passage of an extensive scheme of colonization,\r\nwhich provided for the establishment of Roman colonies at Capua and\r\nTarentum, and, what was an innovation, for a colony outside of Italy on\r\nthe site of Carthage. He further championed the cause of the Latin and\r\nItalian allies, for whom he sought to secure Roman citizenship. The\r\nSenatorial party thereupon endeavored to undermine his influence with the\r\npeople by proposing through the tribune Livius Drusus a more extensive\r\nscheme of colonization, with exemption from rentals for colonists, and\r\nopposing the extension of the franchise to the allied communities, a\r\nmeasure unpopular with the masses who were jealous of sharing their\r\nprivileges with numbers of new citizens.\r\n\r\n*The overthrow of Caius Gracchus: 121 B. C.* Caius personally undertook\r\nthe foundation of the colony, named Junonia, which was located at\r\nCarthage, and his absence of seventy days on this mission gave the\r\nopposition time to organize their forces. His enemies accused him of\r\naiming at a tyranny, his proposal for extension of the franchise was\r\nquashed by the veto of Drusus, and he himself failed to secure his\r\nelection as tribune for 121. With the opening of that year the Senate\r\ninitiated an attack upon some of his measures, especially the founding of\r\nJunonia. The senators were determined to impeach or kill Gracchus, while\r\nhe and his friends organized themselves for defence. A riot in which one\r\nof the senatorial faction was killed gave the Senate the pretext to\r\nproclaim a state of martial law and authorize the consul Opimius to take\r\nany steps to safeguard the state. The followers of Gracchus assembled on\r\nthe Aventine, their overtures were rejected and upon the refusal of Caius\r\nand his chief adherent Flaccus to appear before the Senate, Opimius\r\nattacked them at the head of the Senators, armed slaves and Cretan\r\narchers. The Gracchans were routed; Caius had himself killed by a faithful\r\nslave, and a judicial commission condemned three thousand of his\r\nfollowers.\r\n\r\n*The consequences of the Gracchan disorders.* The memory of the Gracchi\r\nretained a lasting hold upon the affections of the Roman plebs. But\r\nalthough both were earnest patriots, who made a sincere attempt to reform\r\nexisting abuses in the state, one cannot but feel that the success of\r\ntheir political aims would have brought about no permanent improvement. To\r\nsubstitute for the Senate the fickle Assembly as the governing force in\r\nthe state was no true democratic measure owing to the fact that the\r\nAssembly did not properly represent the mass of the citizen body, and as\r\nthe future years were to show, would merely have shifted the reins of\r\npower from one incompetent body to another more incompetent still. As it\r\nwas, the Senate, although victorious, emerged from the contest weakened in\r\nauthority and prestige, and having left a feeling of bitter resentment in\r\nthe hearts of its opponents. It owed its success to violence and not to\r\nlegal measures and thus offered a precedent which others might follow\r\nagainst itself. The alliance between the equestrians and the urban\r\nproletariat while it lasted had proven stronger than the Senate, and this\r\nlesson, too, was not lost upon future statesmen. Besides the loss of some\r\nof its prerogatives, the Senate was weakened by the consolidation of the\r\nbusiness interests as a political party, with which it was brought into\r\nsharp opposition over the question of provincial government. Well might\r\nCaius Gracchus declare that by his judiciary law he had “thrust a dagger\r\ninto the side of the Senate.” For the provincials, the result of this law\r\nwas to usher in an era of increased oppression and misgovernment. The\r\nrefusal of the Romans to grant the franchise to the allies served to\r\nestrange them still further from Rome. On the whole we may say that\r\nconditions in Rome, Italy and the provinces were worse after the time of\r\nthe Gracchi than before.\r\n\r\n*Fate of the agrarian legislation.* It is impossible to estimate how many\r\nRomans received allotments of land under the Gracchan laws. Although the\r\ncensus list rose from 317,000 in 136 to 394,000 in 125, we cannot ascribe\r\nthis increase altogether to an increase in the number of small\r\nproprietors. The admission of freedmen to citizenship doubtless accounts\r\nfor many. Still there was beyond question a decided addition made to the\r\nfree peasantry. The colony of Junonia was abandoned, but the settlers in\r\nAfrica were left undisturbed on their lands. By 120 the restrictions on\r\nthe sale of allotments in Italy were withdrawn; in 118 assignments ceased;\r\nand in 111 rentals to the state were abolished and all lands then held in\r\npossession were declared private property; an enactment which benefited\r\ngreatly the wealthy proprietors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            III. THE WAR WITH JUGURTHA AND THE RISE OF MARIUS\r\n\r\n\r\n*Foreign wars of the Gracchan Age.* While the Senate and the Gracchi were\r\nstruggling for the mastery in Rome, the Roman state engaged in continual\r\nfrontier struggles, particularly on the northern borders of Italy and\r\nMacedonia. Most of these wars were of slight importance, but one resulted\r\nin the occupation of the Balearic Islands, in 123–122, which gave Rome\r\nfull command of the sea route to Spain. Another, still more important, was\r\nthat waged between 125 and 123 in answer to an appeal from Massalia\r\nagainst the Ligurian Salyes to the north of that city. Their subjugation\r\ngave the Romans the command of the route across the Maritime Alps from\r\nItaly to Gaul. The fortress of Aquae Sextiae was established to guard this\r\npassage.\r\n\r\n*The Roman advance in Transalpine Gaul.* It now became the object of the\r\nRomans to secure the land route to Spain. But beyond the territory of\r\ntheir ally Massalia the way was blocked by powerful coalitions of Gallic\r\ntribes. Chief among these were the Allobroges to the east of the Rhone,\r\nthe Arverni the greatest of all, whose territory lay west of that river,\r\nfrom the Loire to the Pyrenees, and the Aedui, to the north of the\r\nArverni. The Romans made an alliance with the latter people who were at\r\nenmity with the other two, and attacked the Allobroges because they had\r\nreceived fugitives from the Salyes. The Arverni were drawn into the\r\nconflict on the side of the Allobroges.\r\n\r\n*The province of Narbonese Gaul.* In 121 B. C. both these peoples were\r\ndecisively beaten in a great battle near the junction of the Isère and the\r\nRhone by the consul Fabius Maximus and the proconsul Domitius. The Romans\r\nwere now masters of all southern Gaul, except Massalia, and organized it\r\nas a province. In 118 B. C. a Roman colony was established at Narbo, which\r\nwas with the exception of the abandoned settlement of Junonia, the first\r\ncolony of Roman citizens sent beyond the Italian peninsula, although\r\ncolonies with Latin rights had been founded in Spain long before. To link\r\nItaly with Spain there was constructed the _via Domitia_, a military road\r\ntraversing the new province.\r\n\r\n*The Jugurthine War.* It was not long before Rome became involved in a\r\nmuch more serious conflict that was destined to reveal to the world the\r\nrottenness and incapacity of its ruling class, and to reawaken internal\r\npolitical strife. In 118 B. C. occurred the death of Micipsa, who had\r\nsucceeded Masinissa as king of Numidia. Micipsa left his kingdom to be\r\nruled jointly by his two sons, Adherbal and Hiempsal, and a nephew,\r\nJugurtha. The latter was an able, energetic, but ambitious and\r\nunscrupulous prince, who had gained a good knowledge of Roman society\r\nthrough serving in the Roman army before Numantia. However, the three soon\r\nquarreled and divided the kingdom. It was not long before Jugurtha caused\r\nHiempsal to be assassinated and drove Adherbal from the country. The\r\nlatter fled to Rome to appeal for aid, on the basis of the alliance with\r\nRome which he had inherited from his ancestors. Thereupon Jugurtha sent\r\nhis agents, with well filled purses, to plead his case before the Senate.\r\nSo successful was he that a Roman commission appointed to divide Numidia\r\nbetween himself and Adherbal gave him the western or richest part of the\r\nkingdom. But Jugurtha’s aim was to rule over the whole of Numidia, and so\r\nhe provoked Adherbal to war. In 113 B. C. he succeeded in besieging him in\r\nhis capital, Cirta, which was defended chiefly by Italians who had settled\r\nthere for commercial reasons. Two Roman commissions sent to investigate\r\nthe situation succumbed to Jugurtha’s diplomacy, and Cirta was forced to\r\nsurrender. Adherbal and all its defenders were put to death.\r\n\r\n*Rome declares war.* The slaughter of so many Italians raised a storm in\r\nRome, where the business elements and populace forced the Senate, which\r\nwas inclined to wink at Jugurtha’s disregard of its African settlement, to\r\ndeclare war. In 111 a Roman army under the consul Bestia invaded Numidia.\r\nAgain Jugurtha resorted to bribes and secured terms of peace from the\r\nconsul after a sham submission. However, the opponents of the Senate saw\r\nthrough the trick and forced an investigation. Jugurtha was summoned to\r\ncome to Rome under safe conduct to give evidence as to his relations with\r\nthe Roman officials in Numidia. He came and contrived to buy the\r\nintervention of two tribunes who prevented his testimony from being taken.\r\nBut, relying too much upon his ability to buy immunity for any action, he\r\nventured to procure the assassination in Rome itself of a rival claimant\r\nto the Numidian throne (110 B. C.). His friends in the Senate dared\r\nprotect him no longer and he had to leave Italy.\r\n\r\n*A Roman defeat, 109 B. C.* The war reopened but the first operations\r\nended in the early part of 109 B. C. with the defeat and capitulation of a\r\nRoman army, which was forced to pass under the yoke, to be released when\r\nits commander consented to a recognition of Jugurtha’s position and an\r\nalliance between him and Rome. In this shameful episode bribery and\r\ntreachery had played their part. The terms were rejected at Rome, and a\r\ntribunician proposal to try those guilty of misconduct with Jugurtha was\r\nratified by the Assembly. In the same year the consul Metellus took\r\ncommand in Africa. One of his officers was Caius Marius. Marius was born\r\nof an equestrian family at Arpinum; he served in the cavalry under Scipio\r\nAemilianus in the Numantine War; engaged with success in the handling of\r\nstate contracts; became tribune in 119, praetor in 116, and propraetor in\r\nSpain in 115 B. C. He was able and ambitious and chafed under the disdain\r\nwith which he as a “new man” was treated by the senatorial aristocrats.\r\n\r\n*Marius, consul: 107 B. C.* Metellus, in contrast to the former commanders\r\nagainst Jugurtha, was both energetic and honorable. He began a methodical\r\ndevastation of Numidia, and forced Jugurtha to abandon the field and\r\nresort to guerilla warfare. He also tried to stir up disloyalty among the\r\nking’s followers. But he failed to kill or capture the latter, which alone\r\nwould terminate the war. Hence when he scornfully refused the request of\r\nMarius to be allowed to return and stand for the consulship in 108, Marius\r\nintrigued to get the command transferred to himself, alleging that\r\nMetellus was purposely prolonging the campaign. Finally, Metellus saw fit\r\nto let him go and he was elected consul for the following year. However,\r\nthe Senate, wishing to keep Metellus in command, had not designated\r\nNumidia as a consular province. And so the popular party passed a law in\r\nthe Assembly of the Tribes which conferred the command against Jugurtha\r\nupon Marius. The Senate yielded to this encroachment upon its prerogatives\r\nand Marius superseded Metellus in 107. His quaestor was Lucius Cornelius\r\nSulla, scion of a decayed patrician family, who was destined to become the\r\nbitter rival of his chief.\r\n\r\n*The end of the war: 107–105 B. C.* Marius continued the methodical\r\nsubjugation of Numidia, but Jugurtha was strengthened by an alliance with\r\nhis father-in-law Bocchus, king of Mauretania. However, Marius won several\r\nhard fought battles over the forces of both kings, and finally, through\r\nthe agency of Sulla, detached Bocchus from the cause of Jugurtha. Bocchus\r\ntreacherously seized his son-in-law and handed him over to the Romans.\r\nThis brought the war to an end. Numidia was divided among princes friendly\r\nto Rome, and Marius returned to triumph in Rome, and to find himself\r\nelected consul for the year 104 in defiance of precedent, owing to the\r\nfear of a barbarian invasion of Italy from the north and the popular\r\nconfidence in him engendered by his African successes. Jugurtha, after\r\ngracing his victor’s triumph, perished in a Roman dungeon.\r\n\r\n*Consequences of the war.* The corruptibility and incapacity, combined\r\nwith an utter lack of public responsibility, displayed by the senators in\r\nthis war contributed to further weaken the already diminished prestige of\r\ntheir order. Besides it had again been demonstrated that a coalition of\r\nthe equestrians and the city populace could control the public policy, and\r\nin the person of Marius, the war had produced a leader upon whom they\r\ncould unite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                IV. THE INVASION OF THE CIMBRI AND TEUTONS\r\n\r\n\r\n*The movements of the Cimbri and Teutons.* The fear of a barbarian\r\ninvasion of Italy which caused Marius to be elected to his second\r\nconsulship was occasioned by the wanderings of a group of Germanic and\r\nCeltic peoples, chief of which were the Cimbri and the Teutons. In 113\r\nB. C. the former, a Germanic tribe, invaded the country of the Taurisci,\r\nallies of Rome, who dwelt north of the Alps. A Roman army sent to the\r\nrescue was defeated. The Cimbri then moved westwards to the Rhine, where\r\nthey were joined by the Teutons (Toygeni), who were probably a branch of\r\nthe Celtic Helvetii, by the Tigurini, another division of the same people,\r\nand by the Ambrones, a tribe of uncertain origin. In 111, the united\r\npeoples crossed the Rhine into Gaul and came into conflict with the Romans\r\nin the new province. Two years later the consul Julius Silanus was\r\ndefeated by the Cimbri, who demanded lands for settlement within Roman\r\nterritory. Their demand was refused and hostilities continued. In 107\r\nanother consul, Lucius Cassius, was defeated and slain by the Tigurini. In\r\n106 Quintus Servilius Caepio recovered the town of Tolosa, which had\r\ndeserted the Roman cause, and carried off its immense temple treasures.\r\nThree years later he was tried and condemned for defrauding the state of\r\nthis booty. In 105, two Roman armies were destroyed by the united tribes\r\nin a battle at Arausio (Orange), in which 60,000 Romans were said to have\r\nfallen. This disaster, the greatest suffered by Rome since Cannae, was\r\nlargely brought about by friction between the two Roman commanders. The\r\nway to Italy lay open but the barbarians failed to take advantage of their\r\nopportunity. The Cimbri invaded Spain and the rest remained in Gaul.\r\n\r\n*The army reforms of Marius.* In this crisis Marius was appointed to the\r\ncommand against the Cimbri and their allies, and at once set to work to\r\ncreate an army for the defence of Italy. The increasing luxury and\r\nrefinements of civilization in Italy had begun to undermine the military\r\nspirit among the Romans, especially the propertied classes, and this had\r\nled to a decline of discipline and efficiency in the Roman armies.\r\nFurthermore, the universal obligation to military service was no longer\r\nrigidly enforced, partly because of the residence abroad of so many\r\ncitizens. Appeals to volunteers became more and more frequent. No longer\r\nwere recruits enrolled for one year only, but took the oath of service for\r\nsixteen years. In building up his new army Marius recognized these new\r\ntendencies. He relied mainly upon voluntary enlistments, admitting to the\r\nranks, as he had done already in the Jugurthine War, those whose lack of\r\nproperty had previously disqualified them for service in the legions. The\r\nsoldiers now became recognized professionals, who upon their discharge\r\nlooked to their commanders to provide for their future. Among the troops\r\nloyalty to the state was supplanted by devotion to a successful general,\r\nand the latter could rely upon his veterans to support him in his\r\npolitical career. Marius also introduced changes in the arms and equipment\r\nof the soldiers, and he is also credited, although with less certainty,\r\nwith the increase in the size of the legion to 6000 men and its division\r\ninto ten cohorts as tactical units.\r\n\r\n*Marius in Gaul.* During the years 104 and 103 Marius kept his army in\r\nGaul guarding the passage to Italy, while he completed the training of his\r\ntroops and dug a new channel at the mouth of the Rhone to facilitate the\r\npassage of his transports into the river. He was re-elected to the\r\nconsulship for 103 and again for 102 since the danger from the barbarians\r\nwas not over. In 102 the Cimbri returned from Spain and, joining the other\r\ntribes, prepared to invade Italy. The Teutons and Ambrones followed the\r\ndirect route from southern Gaul, while the Cimbri and Tigurini moved to\r\nthe north of the Alps to enter Italy by the eastern Alpine passes. Marius\r\npermitted the Teutons and Ambrones to march by him, then he overtook and\r\nannihilated them at Aquae Sextiae. In the meantime, the Cimbri had forced\r\nthe other consul, Quintus Lutatius Catulus, to abandon the defence of the\r\neastern passes and had crossed the Adige into the Po Valley, where they\r\nwintered. Marius returned to Italy to join his colleague and face the new\r\nperil. In the next year, while consul for the fifth time, he met and\r\ndestroyed the Cimbri on the Raudine plains near Vercellae. Thus Italy was\r\nsaved from a repetition of the Gallic invasion of the fourth century B. C.\r\n\r\nThe vitality of the Roman state was by no means exhausted as the defeat of\r\nthe barbarians shows, and men of energy and ability were not lacking, but\r\nunder the existing régime it required a crisis to bring them to the front.\r\n\r\n*The Second Sicilian Slave War, 104–101 B. C.* While the barbarians were\r\nknocking at the gates of Italy, Rome was called upon to suppress a series\r\nof disorders in other parts of her empire, some of which were only quelled\r\nafter considerable effort. In 104 B. C. occurred a serious rebellion of\r\nthe slaves in Sicily, headed by two leaders Salvius and Anthenion, the\r\nformer of whom took the title of King Typhon. The rebels became masters of\r\nthe open country, defeated the forces sent against them, reduced the\r\nSicilian cities to the verge of starvation, and were only subdued by a\r\nconsular army under Manius Aquillius in 101 B. C.\r\n\r\n*War with the Pirates.* Before the slave war in Sicily had been brought to\r\na close the Romans were forced to make an effort to suppress piracy in the\r\nMediterranean. Piracy had been on the increase ever since the decline of\r\nthe Rhodian sea power, following the Second Macedonian War, for as there\r\nwere no longer any rival maritime powers Rome had neglected to maintain a\r\nnavy adequate even for policing the seas. The pirates were at the same\r\ntime slave traders, who made a business of kidnapping all over the\r\nMediterranean but particularly in the east to supply the slave mart at\r\nDelos. In 104 B. C. the king of Bithynia complained to the Senate that\r\none-half of his ablebodied men had been carried into slavery. This traffic\r\nwas winked at by the Romans, since they needed slaves in great numbers for\r\ntheir plantations, and their business interests profited by the trade.\r\nHowever the depredations of the pirates at length became too serious to be\r\nignored, and in 102 B. C. the praetor Marcus Antonius was given a special\r\ncommand against them. They had their chief strongholds on the Cilician\r\ncoast and the island of Crete, and Antonius proceeded to Cilicia, where he\r\ndestroyed several of their towns and annexed some territory, which became\r\nthe province of Cilicia.\r\n\r\nBesides these troubles the Romans had to face revolts in Spain which broke\r\nout spasmodically down to 95 B. C., as well as continual inroads of\r\nbarbarians from Thrace into the provinces of Macedonia and Illyricum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        V. SATURNINUS AND GLAUCIA\r\n\r\n\r\n*Popular **triumphs** in Rome.* The successes of their champion, Marius,\r\nemboldened the populares to undertake the prosecution of the corrupt and\r\nincapable generals of the _optimates_, a number of whom were brought to\r\ntrial and convicted. Another popular victory was won in 104 B. C. when the\r\n_lex Domitia_ transferred the election of new members of the colleges of\r\naugurs and pontiffs from the colleges themselves to a Comitia of seventeen\r\ntribes chosen by lot.\r\n\r\n*The sixth consulship of Marius, 100 B. C.* Upon Marius himself his\r\npresent prestige had an unwholesome effect. In spite of the fact that he\r\nhad violated the constitution by his five consulships, four of which were\r\nheld in succession, he determined to seek a sixth term, although there was\r\nnow no military danger to excuse his ambition. He leagued himself with the\r\nleaders of the _populares_, Lucius Appuleius Saturninus, who as tribune\r\nhad supported Marius in 103, and Caius Servilius Glaucia. Both were\r\nambitious demagogues, who sought to imitate the rôle of the Gracchi by\r\nintroducing a legislative program catering to the popular party. For the\r\nmoment they were successful. Marius secured his sixth consulship for 100\r\nB. C., Saturninus became tribune a second time, and Glaucia praetor. But\r\nviolence had to be resorted to in order to carry the elections. Saturninus\r\nthen introduced bills for the distribution of grain to the city\r\nproletariat at much less than half the market price, for the allotment of\r\nthe lands in north Italy which had been ravaged by the Cimbri, and for the\r\nfounding of colonies in the provinces. His corn law failed, but the others\r\nwere forced through by the aid of the disbanded Marian soldiers. However,\r\nthis appeal to mob violence caused the equestrians to desert the popular\r\nleaders, who also lost the sympathy of Marius. Saturninus then sought the\r\nconsulship for the next year, and, when it seemed that he would be\r\ndefeated, caused one of his most influential rivals to be killed. The\r\nSenate thereupon proclaimed a state of martial law and called upon Marius\r\nto restore order. Saturninus, Glaucia, and their followers occupied the\r\nCapitol, where they were attacked and forced to surrender upon promise\r\nthat their lives would be spared. But Marius was unable to protect them\r\nfrom the vengeance of their foes who massacred all the captives. Again the\r\nSenate had conquered by a resort to force, but this time their opponents\r\nhad first appealed to the same means. For the time Marius suffered a\r\npolitical eclipse; he had shown no political capacity and had been unable\r\nto control or protect his own party which was now divided and discredited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n           VI. THE TRIBUNATE OF MARCUS LIVIUS DRUSUS, 91 B. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n*The **trial** of Rutilius Rufus: 93 B. C.* The senators and the\r\nequestrians had combined for the moment against the terrorism instituted\r\nby the popular demagogues but the coalition was not lasting. As Caius\r\nGracchus had foreseen the control of the law courts proved a standing bone\r\nof contention between the two orders. Especially aggravating to the\r\nsenators was the use of the court established for the trial of cases of\r\nextortion to force the provincial governors to administer the provinces in\r\nthe interest of the Roman financiers. A scandalous instance of this abuse\r\nwas the case of Rutilius Rufus in 93 B. C. He had been quaestor under\r\nMucius Scaevola, in 98 B. C. governor of Asia, where both had sternly\r\nchecked any unjust exactions by the agents of the _publicani_. A\r\ntrumped-up charge of extortion was now brought against Rutilius, and he\r\nwas tried and adjudged guilty. His fate was to serve as a warning to\r\nofficers who took their provincial obligations seriously. Rutilius retired\r\nto Asia and lived in great esteem among the people whom he was condemned\r\nfor having oppressed.\r\n\r\n*The **legislative program** of Livius Drusus: 91 B. C.* Two years later\r\nMarcus Livius Drusus, a tribune, of a prominent senatorial house, brought\r\nforward a proposal for the reform of the juries. He proposed to increase\r\nthe number of the Senate to six hundred by the inclusion of three hundred\r\nprominent equestrians, and to have the juries chosen half from the new\r\nSenate and half from the remaining equestrians.(10) Equestrian _jurors_\r\nwere to be made liable to prosecution for accepting bribes. To secure\r\nsupport for his judiciary law, Drusus introduced a bill to found new\r\ncolonies and another to provide cheaper grain for the city populace.\r\n\r\nHowever, when he encountered serious opposition to his judicial reform in\r\nthe Senate as well as among the _equites_, Drusus combined this and his\r\nother reforms with a law for the enfranchisement of the Italian allies. He\r\ncontrived to carry his measures through the Assembly, which was probably\r\ncoerced by the presence of large numbers of Italians in the city, but\r\nsince he had included several distinct proposals in one bill, which was\r\nunconstitutional, the Senate declared his law invalid. Drusus yielded but\r\nprepared to introduce the franchise bill to be voted on a second time.\r\nBefore this could be done he was mysteriously assassinated, doubtless by\r\nan agent of his political opponents. Thus died the last civilian reformer\r\nof Roman history. Later reforms were carried by the power of the sword.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               VII. THE ITALIAN OR MARSIC WAR, 90–88 B. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n*The Italian Confederacy.* The death of Drusus was the signal for a revolt\r\nof the Italian allies. They had been in close alliance with him, and had\r\ntaken steps for concerted action in arms if his bill should fail to pass.\r\nA confederacy was organized, the government of which was vested in a\r\nSenate of five hundred members with absolute powers, having as executive\r\nofficers two annual consuls and twelve praetors. The capital of the\r\nconfederacy was at Corfinium, in the territory of the Paeligni, which was\r\nrenamed Italia. A federal coinage was issued. Before opening hostilities\r\nthe Italians made a formal demand for Roman citizenship, which the Senate\r\ndefinitely refused. Thereupon they declared their independence.\r\n\r\n*The resources of the rivals.* The Italian Confederacy embraced\r\npractically all the warlike peoples of central and southern Italy. Of\r\nparticular importance were the Marsi who gave their name to the war. In\r\nnumbers the Italians were a match for the Romans, and they had acquired\r\nRoman military tactics, organization and discipline through long service\r\nin the Roman armies. They also could count on leaders of approved ability.\r\nBut the Latin colonies and the Greek cities in the south remained true to\r\ntheir allegiance, and thus the Italians were cut off from the coast.\r\nFurthermore Umbria and Etruria, although disaffected, did not at once take\r\nup arms. Rome’s control of the sea enabled her to draw upon the resources\r\nof the provinces in men, money, and supplies, and consequently she was in\r\na much better position to sustain a prolonged struggle.\r\n\r\n*The first year of the war: 90 B. C.* Hostilities opened in 90 B. C. with\r\nthe Italian forces attempting to reach Etruria in the north and occupy\r\nCampania in the south and the Romans trying to forestall them by invading\r\nthe territory of the allies. In the south the year’s campaign resulted in\r\nnumerous Roman disasters. Much of Campania was won by the allies who\r\nsucceeded in penetrating to the coast. In the north the Romans also\r\nsuffered defeats, but were able to maintain themselves and win several\r\nsuccesses. Here Marius, in the capacity of a _legatus_, rendered valuable\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nBefore the close of the year the revolt began to spread to Etruria and\r\nUmbria. Thereupon the Romans, with the object of securing the support of\r\ntheir still faithful allies and of weakening the ranks of the rebels,\r\npassed the Julian Law which granted Roman citizenship to all who had not\r\njoined the revolt and all who should at once lay down their arms. In this\r\nway the Umbrians and Etrurians were quieted, the Latins and the Greek\r\nallies rewarded, and many communities, which sought Roman citizenship but\r\nnot independence, induced to surrender.\r\n\r\n*The second year of the war.* In the following year the fortune of war\r\nchanged. The Romans were everywhere successful. The consul Pompeius\r\npractically pacified the north, and the _legatus_ Sulla broke the power of\r\nthe allies in south Italy. A second franchise law, the _lex Plautia\r\nPapiria_, helped thin the ranks of the allies by offering Roman\r\ncitizenship to all citizens of Italian federate communities who would\r\nclaim it within sixty days. A third, the Pompeian Law, gave the franchise\r\nto all non-Romans in Gaul south of the Po, and Latin rights to those north\r\nof the Po river. The Senate was now anxious to bring the war to a close\r\nbecause affairs in the East had assumed a threatening aspect.\r\n\r\n*The end of the war and its significance.* In the course of the year 88\r\nB. C. organized resistance among the rebels died out. The new citizens\r\nwere not to be enrolled in all of the thirty-five Roman tribes, a step\r\nwhich might make them dominate the Assemblies, but they were to vote in\r\ncertain tribes only, so that their influence could be restricted.(11)\r\nNaturally, they were dissatisfied with this arrangement and their\r\nenrollment became a burning question of Roman politics. Henceforth all\r\nItalians were Romans and in the course of the next generation the various\r\nracial elements of Italy were gradually welded into a Latin nation. As it\r\nwas impossible for the magistrates of Rome to oversee the administration\r\nthroughout so wide an area, the Romans organized the Italian towns into\r\nlocally self-governing municipalities of the type previously established\r\non Roman territory. At first these municipalities retained many of their\r\nancestral laws, customs and institutions, but in time they conformed to a\r\nuniform type, the government of which was modelled upon that of the\r\ncapital city Rome. The municipalities were powerful agents in the\r\nLatinization of the peninsula.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     VIII. THE FIRST MITHRADATIC WAR\r\n\r\n\r\n*Mithradates VI., Eupator, King of Pontus.* The danger which in 89 B. C.\r\ndirected the attention of the Senate to the eastern Mediterranean was the\r\nresult of the establishment of the Kingdom of Pontus under an able and\r\nambitious ruler, Mithradates Eupator, who challenged the supremacy of Rome\r\nin Asia Minor. In 121 B. C. Mithradates had succeeded to the throne of\r\nnorthern Cappadocia, a small kingdom on the south shore of the Black Sea,\r\nwhose Asiatic population was imbued with Hellenistic culture and whose\r\nrulers claimed descent from the ancient royal house of Persia and from\r\nSeleucus, the founder of the Macedonian kingdom of Syria. For seven years\r\nMithradates shared the throne with his brother, under his mother’s\r\nregency, but in 114 when eighteen years of age, he seized the reins of\r\ngovernment for himself. Subsequently he extended his power over the\r\neastern and northern shores of the Black Sea as far west as the Danube and\r\nthus built up the kingdom of Pontus, i. e. the coast land of the Black\r\nSea, a name which later was applied to his native state of north\r\nCappadocia.\r\n\r\n*His **conflict** with Rome.* However, Mithradates also sought to extend\r\nhis sway in Asia Minor, where Greater Cappadocia became the object of his\r\nambitions. This brought him into conflict with Rome, whose policy was to\r\nprevent the rise of any dangerous neighbor in the East and who refused to\r\nsuffer her settlement of Asia Minor to be disturbed. No less than five\r\ntimes did Mithradates, between 112 and 92 B. C., attempt to bring this\r\ndistrict under his control, but upon each occasion he was forced by Roman\r\ninterference to forego the fruits of his victories, since he was not yet\r\nprepared for war with Rome. In 91 B. C. he occupied the kingdom of\r\nBithynia, which lay between Pontus and the Roman province of Asia, but\r\nagain he yielded to Rome’s demands and withdrew. However, when Roman\r\nagents encouraged the King of Bithynia to raid his territory and refused\r\nhim satisfaction he decided to challenge the Roman arms, seeing that Rome\r\nwas now involved in the war with her Italian allies. War began late in 89\r\nB. C.\r\n\r\n*The conquests of Mithradates in Asia, 89–88 B. C.* Mithradates was well\r\nprepared; he had a trained army and a fleet of three hundred ships. He\r\nexperienced no difficulty in defeating the local levies raised by the\r\nRoman governor of Asia, and speedily overran Bithynia and most of the\r\nRoman province. Meanwhile his fleet swept the Aegean Sea. The Roman\r\nprovincials who had been unmercifully exploited by tax gatherers and\r\nmoney-lenders greeted Mithradates as a deliverer. At his order on a set\r\ndate in 88 B. C. they massacred the Romans and Italians resident in Asia,\r\nsaid to have numbered 80,000, a step which bound them firmly to the cause\r\nof the king.\r\n\r\n*Athens and Delos.* In the same year, 88 B. C. the populace of Athens, in\r\nthe hope of overthrowing the oligarchic government which had been set up\r\nin the city with the support of Rome, seized control of the state and\r\nthrew themselves into the hands of Mithradates. One of the king’s\r\ngenerals, Archelaus, while on his way to Athens, exterminated the Italian\r\ncolony at Delos, the center of the Roman commercial and banking interests\r\nin the East. From this blow the island port never fully recovered.\r\nArchelaus soon won over most of southern Greece to his master’s cause,\r\nwhile Mithradates sent a large army to enter Hellas by the northerly route\r\nthrough Thrace and Macedonia.\r\n\r\n*Disorders in Rome.* This situation produced a crisis in Rome. Sulla, who\r\nhad been elected consul for 88 B. C., was allotted the command in the East\r\nupon the outbreak of hostilities. However, he had been unable to leave\r\nItaly where he was conducting the siege of Nola in Campania. Marius,\r\nalthough in his sixty-eighth year, was as ambitious as ever and schemed to\r\nsecure the command against Mithradates for himself. In this he was\r\nsupported by the equestrians, who knew Sulla to be a firm upholder of the\r\nSenate. Accordingly the Marians joined forces with the tribune Publius\r\nSulpicius Rufus, who had brought forward a bill to enroll the new citizens\r\nand freedmen equally in each of the thirty-five tribes. Sulpicius\r\norganized a body-guard of equestrians and instituted a reign of terror. He\r\npassed his law by force in spite of the opposition of the consuls. When\r\nSulla had left the city to join his army, a law was passed in the Assembly\r\ntransferring his command in the East to Marius. But Sulla refused to admit\r\nthe legality of the act, and, relying upon the support of his troops,\r\nmarched on Rome. Having taken the city by surprise, he caused Sulpicius,\r\nMarius, and others of their party to be outlawed. Sulpicius was slain; but\r\nMarius made good his escape to Mauretania. The Sulpician Laws were\r\nabrogated, and Sulla introduced a number of reforms, with the object of\r\nstrengthening the position of the Senate. The most significant of these\r\nreforms was the revival of the Senatorial veto over laws proposed in the\r\nAssembly of the Tribes. This done, upon the conclusion of his consulate,\r\nSulla embarked with his army for Greece early in 87 B. C.\r\n\r\n*Siege of Athens and Piraeus, 87–86 B. C.* Driving the forces of Archelaus\r\nand the Athenians from the open country, Sulla began the siege of Athens\r\nand of its harbor town Piraeus in the autumn of 87. Athens was completely\r\ninvested, but in spite of hunger the resistance was prolonged until March,\r\n86, when Sulla’s troops penetrated an unguarded spot on the walls and the\r\ncity was sacked. A large number of the inhabitants were massacred but the\r\npublic buildings were spared. Soon after Piraeus was taken by storm at\r\nterrific cost to the victors, but its citadel Munychia held out until\r\nevacuated by Archelaus.\r\n\r\n*Chaeronea and Orchomenus.* From Athens Sulla hastened to meet the army of\r\nMithradates which had penetrated as far as Boeotia. At Chaeronea the\r\nnumerically inferior but better disciplined Romans won a complete victory.\r\nAt this juncture there arrived in Greece the consul Flaccus at the head of\r\nanother army, with orders to supersede Sulla. The latter, however, was not\r\ndisposed to give up his command and as Flaccus feared to force the issue\r\nthey came to an agreement whereby each pursued a separate campaign. This\r\nleft Sulla free to meet a new Mithradatic army which had crossed the\r\nAegean. At Orchomenus he attacked and annihilated it. But Mithradates\r\nstill controlled the Aegean, and Sulla, being unable to cross into Asia,\r\nwas forced to winter in Greece.\r\n\r\n*Peace with Mithradates, 85 B. C.* In 85 B. C. Lucius Lucullus, Sulla’s\r\nquaestor, appeared in the Aegean with a fleet that he had gathered among\r\nRome’s allies in the East. He defeated the fleet of Mithradates and\r\nsecured Sulla’s passage to Asia. The king’s position was now precarious.\r\nHis exactions had alienated the sympathies of the Greek cities which now\r\nbegan to desert his cause. Furthermore Flaccus, after recovering Macedonia\r\nand Thrace, had crossed the Bosphorus into Bithynia. There he was killed\r\nin a mutiny of his soldiers and was succeeded by his legate Fimbria, who\r\nwas popular with the troops because he gratified their desire for plunder.\r\nBut Fimbria was energetic; he defeated Mithradates and recovered the coast\r\ndistrict as far south as Pergamon (86 B. C.). Mithradates was ready for\r\npeace and Sulla was anxious to have his hands free to return to Italy,\r\nwhere the Marians were again in power. Negotiations were opened by\r\nMithradates with Sulla and after some delay peace was concluded in 85\r\nB. C. on the following terms: The king was to surrender Cappadocia,\r\nBithynia, the Roman province of Asia and his other conquests in Asia\r\nMinor, to pay an indemnity of 3000 talents, and give up a part of his\r\nfleet. His kingdom of Pontus remained intact.\r\n\r\n*Sulla’s treatment of Asia and Greece, 85–83 B. C.* Sulla spent the\r\nfollowing winter in Asia, readjusting affairs in the province. The\r\nrebellious communities were punished by the quartering of troops upon\r\nthem, and by being forced to contribute to Sulla the huge sum of 20,000\r\ntalents, or $24,000,000. To raise this amount they were forced to borrow\r\nfrom Roman bankers and incur a crushing burden of debt. In 84 B. C. Sulla\r\ncrossed to Greece, there to complete his preparations for a return to\r\nItaly. The Greek states had suffered heavily in the recent campaigns on\r\nher soil. Sulla had carried off the temple treasures of Olympia, Delphi\r\nand Epidaurus, Attica and Boeotia had been ravaged and depopulated, and\r\nthe coasts had been raided by the Mithradatic fleet. From the devastations\r\nof the Mithradatic war Hellas never recovered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         IX. SULLA’S DICTATORSHIP\r\n\r\n\r\n*The Marian party in Rome 87–84 B. C.* While Sulla had been conducting his\r\nsuccessful campaign in Greece, in Italy the Marian party had again won the\r\nupper hand. Scarcely had Sulla left Italy with his army when the consul\r\nCinna re-enacted the Sulpician Laws. His colleague Gnaeus Octavius and the\r\nsenatorial faction drove him from the city and had him deposed from\r\noffice. But Cinna received the support of the army in Campania, recalled\r\nMarius, and made peace with the Samnites still under arms by granting them\r\nRoman citizenship. Marius landed in Etruria, raised an army there, and he\r\nand Cinna advanced on Rome. They forced the capitulation of their\r\nopponents, had Cinna reinstated as consul, and had the banishment of\r\nMarius revoked; Sulla’s laws were repealed, and his property confiscated.\r\nThen ensued a massacre of the leading senators, including Octavius the\r\nconsul. On 1 January, 86, Marius entered upon his seventh consulship and\r\ndied a few days later. His successor, Lucius Valerius Flaccus, was sent to\r\nsupersede Sulla, a mission which cost him his life, as related before. In\r\n85 B. C., the war with Mithradates was at an end and the Marians had to\r\nface the prospect of the return of Sulla at the head of a victorious army.\r\nThe consuls Cinna and Carbo proceeded to raise troops to oppose him. They\r\nillegally prolonged their office for the next year (84) and made\r\npreparations to cross the Adriatic and meet Sulla in Macedonia. But the\r\narmy gathered for this purpose at Brundisium mutinied and murdered Cinna.\r\nCarbo prevented the election of a successor and held office as sole\r\nconsul. The Senate had previously begun negotiations with Sulla in an\r\neffort to prevent further civil war. He now demanded the restitution of\r\nproperty and honors both for himself and all those who had taken refuge\r\nwith him. The Senate was inclined to yield, but was prevented by Carbo.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 83 B. C. Sulla landed at Brundisium, with an army of\r\n40,000 veterans from whom he exacted an oath of allegiance to himself. He\r\nmade known his intentions of respecting all privileges granted to the\r\nItalians, to prevent their joining his enemies. Still the bulk of the new\r\ncitizens, particularly in Samnium and Etruria, supported the Marian party.\r\nSulla was joined at once by the young Cnaeus Pompey, who had raised an\r\narmy on his own authority in Picenum, and by other men of influence. In\r\nthe operations which followed the leaders of the Marians showed themselves\r\nlacking in coöperation and military skill. Sulla penetrated into Campania,\r\nwhere he defeated one consul Norbanus, at Mount Tifata. The other consul\r\nScipio Asiaticus, entered into negotiations with him, and was deserted by\r\nhis army which went over to Sulla.\r\n\r\nIn the following year Sulla advanced into Latium and won a hard fought\r\nvictory over the younger Marius, now consul, at Sacriportus. Rome fell\r\ninto his hands and Marius took refuge in Praeneste. Sulla then turned\r\nagainst the second consul, Carbo, in Etruria, and, after several victories\r\nforced him to flee to Africa. In a final effort the Marians, united with\r\nthe Samnites, tried to relieve Praeneste; failing to accomplish this they\r\nmade a dash upon Rome. But Sulla appeared in time to save the city and\r\nutterly defeat his enemies in a bloody contest at the Colline Gate.\r\nPraeneste fell soon after; Marius committed suicide, and except at a few\r\nisolated points all resistance in Italy was over.\r\n\r\n*Sulla’s aims.* Sulla was absolute master of the situation and at once\r\nproceeded to punish his enemies and reward his friends. In cold-blooded\r\ncruelty, without any legal condemnation, his leading opponents were marked\r\nout for vengeance; their names were posted in lists in the forum to\r\nindicate that they might be slain with impunity and that their goods were\r\nconfiscated. Rewards were offered to informers who brought about the death\r\nof such victims, and many were included in the lists to gratify the\r\npersonal enmities of Sulla’s friends. The goods of the proscribed were\r\nauctioned off publicly under Sulla’s direction, and their children and\r\ngrandchildren declared ineligible for public office. From these\r\nproscriptions the equestrians suffered particularly; 2600 of them are said\r\nto have perished, together with ninety senators. The Italian\r\nmunicipalities also felt Sulla’s avenging hand. Widespread confiscations\r\nof land, especially in Samnium and Etruria, enabled him to provide for\r\n150,000 of his veterans, whose settlement did much to hasten the\r\nlatinization of these districts. Ten thousand slaves of the proscribed\r\nwere set free by Sulla and took the name of Cornelii from their patron.\r\nThese arrangements were given the sanction of legality by a decree of the\r\nSenate and a law which confirmed all his acts as consul and proconsul and\r\ngave him full power for the future.\r\n\r\n*Sulla dictator: 82–79 B. C.* But Sulla’s aims went further than the\r\ndestruction of the Marian party. He sought to recreate a stable government\r\nin the state. For this he required more constitutional powers than the\r\nright of might. Therefore, since both consuls were dead, he caused the\r\nappointment of an _interrex_ who by virtue of a special law appointed him\r\na dictator for an unlimited term to enact legislation and reorganize the\r\ncommonwealth (_dictator legibus scri__bundis et rei publicae\r\nconstituendae_). Sulla’s appointment occurred late in 82 B. C. The scope\r\nof his powers and their unlimited duration gave him monarchical or rather\r\ntyrannical authority.\r\n\r\n*Sulla’s reforms.* The general aim of Sulla’s legislation was to restore\r\nthe Senate to the position which it had held prior to 133 B. C. and to\r\nguarantee the perpetuation of this condition. His reforms fall into two\r\nclasses; firstly, those directed to securing the rule of the _optimates_,\r\nwhich were not long-lived; secondly, those seeking to increase the\r\nefficiency of the administration, which being of a non-partizan character\r\nenjoyed greater permanency than the preceding. Those of the former sort\r\nconstituted a renewal and extension of his reforms of 88 B. C. The\r\nsenatorial veto over legislation in the Assembly of Tribes was renewed,\r\nand the tribunes’ intercession restricted to interference with the\r\nexercise of the magistrate’s _imperium_. To deter able and ambitious men\r\nfrom seeking the tribunate, it was made a bar to further political office.\r\nThe senators were once more made eligible for the juries, while the\r\nequestrians were disqualified. The Domitian Law of 104 B. C. was abrogated\r\nand the practise of co-opting the members of the priestly college was\r\nrevived. Most important of Sulla’s administrative reforms was that which\r\nconcerned the magistracy. The established order of offices in the _cursus\r\nhonorum_ was maintained, an age limit set for eligibility to each office,\r\nand an interval of ten years required between successive tenures of the\r\nsame post. The number of quaestors was increased to twenty, that of the\r\npraetors raised from six to eight. In connection therewith the method of\r\nappointing provincial governors was regulated. By the organization of the\r\nprovince of Cisalpine Gaul, the number of provinces was raised to ten, and\r\nthe two consuls and eight praetors, upon the completion of their year of\r\noffice in Rome, were to be appointed to the provinces as pro-consuls and\r\npropraetors for one year. The pro-magistrates thus lost their original\r\nextraordinary character and this change marks the first step in the\r\ncreation of an imperial civil service.\r\n\r\nAs before, the Senate designated the consular provinces before the\r\nelection of the consuls who would be their proconsular governors. The\r\nconsuls were not deprived of the right of military command, but, as\r\nbefore, regularly assumed control of military operations in Italy. The\r\nconsular _imperium_ remained senior to that of the provincial governors,\r\nand might be exercised beyond the frontiers of Italy. However, in practise\r\nthe consuls were not regularly employed for overseas campaigns, since the\r\nSenate now arrogated to itself what had previously been a prerogative of\r\nthe Assembly, namely, the right of selecting any person whatever to\r\nexercise military _imperium_ in any sphere determined by itself. A new\r\nfield for the activity of the praetors arose from the establishment of\r\nspecial jury courts for the trial of cases of bribery, treason, fraud,\r\npeculation, assassination and assault with violence. These were modelled\r\non the court for damage suits brought against provincial officers, and\r\nsuperseded the old procedure with its appeal from the verdict of the\r\nmagistrate to the Comitia. To provide a sufficient number of jurors for\r\nthese tribunals the membership of the Senate was increased from three\r\nhundred to six hundred by enrolling equestrians who had supported Sulla.\r\nThis increased number was maintained by the annual admission of the twenty\r\nex-quaestors, whereby censors were rendered unnecessary for enrolling the\r\nSenators. The administration, especially in its imperial aspects, was more\r\nthan ever concentrated in the Senate’s hands.\r\n\r\n*Pompey **“**the Great,**”** 79 B. C.* While Sulla was effecting his\r\nsettlement of affairs in Rome and Italy, the Marians in Sicily and Africa\r\nwere crushed by his lieutenant Cnaeus Pompey. Their leader Carbo was taken\r\nand executed. In 82 B. C. Sulla had caused the Senate to confer upon\r\nPompey the command in this campaign with the _imperium_ of a propraetor,\r\nalthough he had not yet held any public office. Having finished his task\r\nPompey demanded a triumph, an honor which previously had only been granted\r\nto regular magistrates. Sulla at first opposed his wishes, but as Pompey\r\nwas insistent and defiant, he yielded to avoid a quarrel, and even\r\naccorded him the name of Magnus or the Great. Pompey celebrated his\r\ntriumph 12 March, 79 B. C.\r\n\r\n*Sulla’s retirement and death, 78 B. C.* Sulla did not seek political\r\npower for its own sake, and, after carrying his reforms into effect, he\r\nresigned his dictatorship in 79 B. C. He retired to enjoy a life of ease\r\nand pleasure on his Campanian estate, relying for his personal security\r\nand that of his measures upon his veterans and the Cornelian freedmen. In\r\nthe following year he died at the age of sixty. Sulla’s genius was rather\r\nmilitary than political. Fond though he was of sensual pleasures, he was\r\npossessed of great ambition which led him to such a position of prominence\r\nthat he was forced to adopt the cause of one of the two political factions\r\nin the state. From that point he must crush his enemies or be crushed by\r\nthem; and in this lies the explanation of his attempt to extirpate the\r\nMarian party. As a statesman he displayed little imagination or\r\nconstructive ability. He could think of nothing better than to restore the\r\nSenate to a position which it had shown itself unable to maintain; and his\r\npersecutions of his political opponents had not crushed out opposition to\r\nthe Senate, but left a legacy of hatred endangering the permanence of his\r\nreforms.\r\n\r\nThe epoch between the tribunate of Tiberius Gracchus and the death of\r\nSulla revealed the incapacity of either the Senate or the tribunes and the\r\nAssembly to give a peaceful and stable government to the Roman state.\r\nSulla’s career, anticipating those of Caesar and Augustus, pointed the way\r\nto the ultimate solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n\r\n                THE RISE OF POMPEY THE GREAT: 78–60 B. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n*The extraordinary commands.* For the period following the death of Sulla\r\nin 78 B. C. Roman history centers around the lives of a small group of\r\neminent men, whose ambitions and rivalries are the determining factors in\r\nthe political life of the state. This is due to the fact that neither the\r\nSenate nor the Assembly have the power to control the men to whom the\r\nneeds of the empire compel them to give military authority. The generation\r\nof Marius and Sulla had seen the rise of the professional army which\r\nrevealed itself as the true power in the state, and the disturbances of\r\nthe Italian and Civil Wars supplied an abundance of needy recruits who\r\nsought service with a popular and successful general for the sake of the\r\nrewards which it lay in his power to bestow. As military achievements were\r\nthe sole sure foundation for political success, able men made it the goal\r\nof their ambition to be entrusted with an important military command. The\r\ndangers of civil and foreign wars at first compelled the Senate to confer\r\nmilitary power upon the few available men of recognized ability even when\r\nit distrusted their ulterior motives, and later such appointments were\r\nmade by the Assembly through the coalition of the general and the\r\ntribunate. In this way arose the so-called extraordinary commands, that\r\nis, such as involved a military _imperium_ which in some way exceeded that\r\nof the regular constitutional officers and required to be created or\r\ndefined by a special enactment of the Senate or Comitia.\r\n\r\nThe man who first realized the value of the extraordinary command as a\r\npath to power was Pompey the Great.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       I. POMPEY’S COMMAND AGAINST SERTORIUS IN SPAIN: 77–71 B. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n*The revolt of Lepidus.* It was not to be expected that Sulla’s measures\r\nwould long remain unassailed. Those dispossessed of their property, those\r\ndisqualified for office, and the equestrians who sought to regain control\r\nof the courts, were all anxious to undo part of his work. They found a\r\nleader in Lepidus, who as consul in 78 B. C., the very year of Sulla’s\r\ndeath, sought to renew the distribution of cheap grain to the masses in\r\nRome, which Sulla had suppressed, to restore the Marian exiles, and\r\nreinstate those who had lost their lands. For the time he failed to carry\r\nhis proposals, but in the next year, as proconsul of Cisalpine Gaul, he\r\nraised an army and marched on Rome to seize the consulate for a second\r\nterm, since disorders had prevented the election of consuls for that year.\r\nHowever he was defeated by his former colleague, the proconsul Catulus,\r\nand Pompey, whom the Senate had appointed to a subordinate command in view\r\nof his military expedience. Lepidus crossed over to Sardinia where he died\r\nshortly after, and the bulk of his forces under Marcus Perperna withdrew\r\nto Spain, to join the Marians who were in revolt there.\r\n\r\n*Sertorius in Spain, 83–78 B. C.* The rebellion in Spain was headed by\r\nQuintus Sertorius, who had been appointed governor of Hither Spain by\r\nCinna in 83 B. C. Two years later he was driven out by Sulla’s\r\nrepresentative, but, after various adventures, returned in 80 B. C. to\r\nhead a revolt of the Lusitanians. His ability as a guerrilla leader, and\r\nthe confidence which he aroused among the native Spaniards soon created\r\nalarm in Rome. Sertorius professed to take the field not against Rome but\r\nagainst the Senate. He regarded himself as the legitimate governor of\r\nSpain, employed members of the Marian party as his military and civil\r\nsubordinates and organized a Senate among the Romans of his following. To\r\ncrush the revolt Sulla sent out to Farther Spain Metellus, the consul of\r\n80 B. C., but he failed to make any headway, and Sertorius was able to\r\noverrun Hither Spain also. In 79 B. C. the praetor of that province was\r\nkilled in battle, and the same fate befell the proconsul of Narbonese Gaul\r\nwho came to the help of Metellus (78 B. C.).\r\n\r\n*Pompey sent to Spain, 78 B. C.* It was imperative to send a new commander\r\nand a new army to Spain. As the consuls were unwilling to go, Pompey, who\r\nhad refused to disband his army at the orders of Catulus, sought the\r\ncommand. The Senate could not help itself and, in spite of considerable\r\nopposition, passed a decree conferring upon him proconsular _imperium_ and\r\nentrusting him with the conduct of the war in Hither Spain. Even after the\r\narrival of Pompey with an army of 40,000 men Sertorius was more than able\r\nto hold his own against his foes in 76 and 75 B. C. At the end of the\r\nlatter year Pompey was forced to recross the Pyrenees and appeal to the\r\nSenate for reinforcements. At the same time Sertorius, through the agency\r\nof the pirates, entered into alliance with Mithradates, King of Pontus,\r\nwho was again on the point of war with Rome.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of the desired reinforcements enabled Pompey in 74 and 73\r\nB. C. to turn the tide against Sertorius. To prevent desertions the latter\r\nresorted to severe punishments which alienated the Spaniards, who were\r\nalready estranged by the acts of his subordinates. He was further hampered\r\nby dissensions in the ranks of his Roman supporters. The center of\r\ndisaffection was Perpenna, who treacherously assassinated Sertorius in 72\r\nB. C. and assumed command of his forces. However he was defeated by\r\nPompey, taken captive and executed. The revolt was broken and pacification\r\nof Spain speedily accomplished. Pompey was able to return to Rome in 71\r\nB. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       II. THE COMMAND OF LUCULLUS AGAINST MITHRADATES: 74–66 B. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n*The situation in the Near East.* After concluding peace with Sulla in 85\r\nB. C., Mithradates Eupator directed his energies to consolidating his\r\nkingdom and reorganizing his forces in expectation of a renewal of the\r\nstruggle with Rome. He recognised that Sulla had been ready to make peace\r\nonly because of the situation in Italy and the fact that he had been\r\nunable to secure written confirmation of the terms of the treaty warned\r\nhim that the Romans still contemplated his complete overthrow. Indeed he\r\nhad been attacked in the years 83 and 82 B. C. by Lucius Murena, the\r\nproconsul of Asia, but had been able to defend himself and Sulla had once\r\nmore brought about a cessation of hostilities. Meantime, Tigranes of\r\nArmenia, the ally of Mithradates, had enlarged his dominions by the\r\nannexation of Syria (83 B. C.), where he terminated the rule of the house\r\nof Seleucus, and of Greater Cappadocia.\r\n\r\n*The command of Lucullus and Cotta, 74 B. C.* In 75 B. C. occurred the\r\ndeath of Nicomedes III, King of Bithynia, who left his kingdom to the\r\nRoman people. The Senate accepted the inheritance and made Bithynia a\r\nprovince, but Mithradates championed the claims of a son of Nicomedes and\r\ndetermined to dispute the possession of Bithynia with the Romans. He had\r\nraised an efficient army and navy, was leagued with the pirates, and in\r\nalliance with Sertorius, who supplied him with officers and recognized his\r\nclaims to Bithynia and other districts in Asia Minor. Rome was threatened\r\nwith another serious war. One of the senatorial faction, the consul Lucius\r\nLucullus, contrived to have assigned to himself by a senatorial decree the\r\nprovinces of Cilicia and Asia with command of the main operations against\r\nMithradates, while his colleague Cotta received Bithynia and a fleet to\r\nguard the Hellespont. At the same time a praetor, Marcus Antonius, was\r\ngiven an extraordinary command against the pirates with an unlimited\r\n_imperium_ over the Mediterranean Sea and its coast. However, he proved\r\nutterly incompetent, was defeated in an attack upon Crete, and died there.\r\n\r\n*Siege of Cyzicus, 74–3 B. C.* Early in 74 B. C., Mithradates invaded\r\nBithynia. There he was encountered by Cotta, whom he defeated and\r\nblockaded in Chalcedon. Thereupon he invaded Asia and laid siege to\r\nCyzicus. But Lucullus cut off his communications and in the ensuing winter\r\nhe was forced to raise the siege and retire with heavy losses into\r\nBithynia. The following year a fleet which Lucullus had raised defeated\r\nthat of Mithradates. This enabled the Romans to recover Bithynia and\r\ninvade Pontus. In 72 B. C. Lucullus defeated Mithradates and forced him to\r\ntake refuge in Armenia. In the course of this and the two following years\r\nhe completed the subjugation of Pontus by the systematic reduction of its\r\nfortified cities. Cotta undertook the siege of Heraclea in Bithynia and\r\nupon its fall in 71 B. C. returned to Rome. The winter of 71–70 B. C.\r\nLucullus spent in Asia reorganizing the financial situation. There the\r\ncities were laboring under a frightful burden of indebtedness to Roman\r\nbankers and taxgatherers which had its origin in the exactions of Sulla.\r\nLucullus interfered on behalf of the provincials and by reducing the\r\naccumulated interest on their debts enabled them to pay off their\r\nobligations within four years. This care for the provincials won for\r\nhimself the bitter enmity of the Roman financial interests which sought to\r\ndeprive him of his command.\r\n\r\n*Invasion of Armenia, 69 B. C.* As the war could not be regarded as\r\nterminated so long as Mithradates was at large, Lucullus demanded his\r\nsurrender from Tigranes. When the latter refused Lucullus invaded Armenia,\r\ndefeated him and took his capital, Tigranocerta, 69 B. C. In the following\r\nyear Lucullus attempted to complete the subjugation of Armenia but was\r\nprevented by the mutinous conduct of his troops. He was unpopular with his\r\nmen because he maintained discipline and protected the subject peoples\r\nfrom the excesses of the soldiers. Also some of his legions had come to\r\nthe East with Fimbria in 86 B. C. and clamored for the discharge to which\r\nthey were entitled. In 67 B. C. Mithradates reappeared in Pontus and\r\nLucullus had to return from Armenia to face him, whereupon Tigranes began\r\nto recover lost ground. Because of the mutiny in his army Lucullus was\r\nforced to remain inactive. He had already been superseded in the command\r\nof Asia, Cilicia and Bithynia, which had come under his control with the\r\nreturn of Cotta, and his enemies in Rome deprived him of the remnants of\r\nhis authority in 66 B. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              III. THE REVOLT OF THE GLADIATORS: 73–71 B. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Spartacus.* While Pompey was fighting Sertorius in Spain and Lucullus was\r\npursuing Mithradates in Bithynia a serious slave war arose in Italy. It\r\nbegan in 73 B. C. with the revolt of a band of gladiators from a training\r\nschool in Capua under the leadership of the Thracian Spartacus and the\r\nGauls, Crixus and Onemaus. Taking refuge on the slopes of Vesuvius they\r\nrapidly recruited large numbers of runaway slaves. They defeated the\r\narmies of two Roman praetors and overran Campania, Lucania, and all\r\nsouthern Italy. By the end of the year 73 B. C. their number had grown to\r\n70,000.\r\n\r\nIn the next year they divided their forces; the Gauls and Germans followed\r\nCrixus, the Thracians Spartacus. The two consuls took the field against\r\nthem; Crixus and his horde were defeated in Apulia. Spartacus marched\r\nnorth, intending to make his way through the Alps to Thrace. The consuls\r\npursued him, and he defeated them one after the other. Thereupon his\r\nfollowers refused to leave Italy and turned southwards, plundering as they\r\nwent. Again Spartacus defeated the consuls but dared not attack Rome and\r\nretired to South Italy.\r\n\r\n*Crassus in command, 71 B. C.* In 71 B. C. the consuls displayed no\r\nenthusiasm to undertake the command against Spartacus, and so the Senate\r\nappointed as extraordinary commander the praetor Marcus Licinius Crassus,\r\none of Sulla’s veteran officers, who volunteered his services. After\r\nrestoring discipline among his troops, Crassus succeeded in penning up\r\nSpartacus in the peninsula of Bruttium. Spartacus hired some Cilician\r\npirates to transport him to Sicily, but, after receiving their price, they\r\nabandoned him to his fate. He succeeded in breaking through Crassus’\r\nlines, but his forces divided into two detachments, each of which was\r\ncaught and beaten. Spartacus fell in battle; while 6000 of his following\r\nwere taken and crucified. Crassus had bent all his energies to bring the\r\nrevolt to a close before the arrival of Pompey, who was on his way from\r\nSpain. This he might fairly claim to have accomplished although a body of\r\n5000 slaves who had escaped to North Italy were met by Pompey and\r\nannihilated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            IV. THE CONSULATE OF POMPEY AND CRASSUS: 70 B. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Pompey and Crassus consuls.* Both Pompey and Crassus, flushed by their\r\nvictories in Spain and in Italy, now demanded the right to stand for the\r\nconsulship for 70 B. C. Both sought triumphs and under this pretext did\r\nnot disband their armies. The Senate resisted their claims, for Pompey’s\r\ncandidature was clearly unconstitutional, and since Crassus was praetor in\r\n71 he was not eligible for the consulate in the following year.\r\nFurthermore both were distrusted because of their ambitious natures. In\r\nview of this opposition Crassus, in spite of mutual jealousy between\r\nhimself and Pompey, made overtures to the latter and they agreed to unite\r\ntheir forces. They also made a bid for the support of the _populares_ by\r\npromising to restore the tribunate to its former privileges and for that\r\nof the equestrians by promising to reinstate them in the jury courts. This\r\ncombination overawed senatorial opposition, their candidatures were\r\nlegalized by special bills and both were elected. In their consulate the\r\ntribunes were relieved of the restrictions which Sulla had placed upon\r\ntheir activities, and the jury courts were reorganized. However, the\r\nlatter were not given over completely to the equestrians, but each panel\r\nof jurors was to consist of three equal sections, one drawn from the\r\nSenate, one from the _equites_, and one from the _tribuni aerarii_, the\r\nclass of citizens whose assessment was next to that of the _equites_. The\r\nSullan régime was at an end, and in the tribunate emancipated from the\r\nSenate’s control the ambitious general of the future was to find his most\r\nvaluable ally.\r\n\r\n*Trial of Verres.* In the same year, prior to the passing of the Aurelian\r\nLaw which reformed the juries, occurred the trial of Caius Verres,\r\nex-propraetor of Sicily, a case notable because the prosecution was\r\nconducted by the young Marcus Tullius Cicero, whose accusation contained\r\nin his published _Orations against Caius Verres_ constitutes a most\r\nilluminating commentary upon provincial misgovernment under the Sullan\r\nrégime. The senatorial juries after 82 B. C., had protected the interests\r\nof the provinces no better than had the equestrian juries established by\r\nCaius Gracchus. They had shown themselves shamelessly venal, and a\r\nprovincial governor who made judicious disbursements could be confident\r\nthat he would be acquitted of any charges of extortion brought against\r\nhim. Relying upon this Verres, who was propraetor of Sicily in 73, 72 and\r\n71 B. C., had carried off from that province money and valuables estimated\r\nat 40,000,000 sesterces ($2,000,000). He had openly boasted that he\r\nintended the profits of one year for himself, those of the second for his\r\nfriends and patrons, and those of the third for his jurors. At the opening\r\nof the year 70 B. C. the Sicilian cities sued Verres for restitution of\r\ndamages and chose Cicero as their advocate. Cicero was a native of\r\nArpinum, the birthplace of Marius, and was now in his thirty-sixth year.\r\nHis upright conduct as quaestor in western Sicily in 75 B. C. had earned\r\nhim the confidence of the Sicilians, and his successful conduct of the\r\ndefense in several previous trials had marked him as a pleader of\r\nexceptional ability. But Verres had entrusted his case to Quintus\r\nHortensius Hortalus, regarded at the time as the foremost of Roman\r\norators, and every conceivable device was resorted to in order to prevent\r\nthe case from coming to trial. Another prosecutor appeared, who claimed to\r\nhave a better right than Cicero to bring suit against Verres. This\r\nnecessitated a trial to decide which could better claim to represent the\r\nSicilians. Cicero was able to expose the falsity of the claims of his\r\nrival, who was acting in collusion with Verres. He then proceeded to\r\nSicily where he gathered his evidence in fifty of the hundred and ten days\r\nallowed him for the purpose. Before the hearing the elections for the next\r\nyear were held and Hortensius elected consul, but Cicero was returned as\r\naedile in spite of all the efforts of his opponents to weaken his prestige\r\nby a defeat at the polls.\r\n\r\nThe trial was set for the fifth of August, and as there were fifty\r\nholidays for various festivals between that date and the end of the year,\r\nthe defense hoped to drag out the trial until after January first, when a\r\npraetor friendly to Verres would preside over the court for extortion. But\r\nCicero defeated their hopes by abstaining from any long formal speech of\r\naccusation and contenting himself with a brief statement of the obstacles\r\nthe defense had placed in his way, a threat to punish in his capacity of\r\naedile any attempts at corruption, and a short statement of the charge\r\nagainst Verres. He then called his witnesses. Hortensius found himself\r\nwithout any arguments to combat and could not refute the evidence. Before\r\nthe hearing of the witnesses was concluded Verres went into exile. He was\r\ncondemned in his absence and Cicero became the leading advocate of the\r\nday. However, it must be admitted that the condemnation of Verres was also\r\npartly due to the danger of the loss of their privileges which threatened\r\nthe senatorial jurors.\r\n\r\n*The crimes of Verres.* The evidence which had been brought out against\r\nVerres was afterwards used by Cicero in composing his _Second Pleading\r\nagainst Verres_ (_actio secunda in Verrem_) which was of course never\r\ndelivered, but was a political pamphlet in the form of a fictitious\r\noration. From it we learn the devices of which the governor made use to\r\namass a fortune at the expense of his province. By initiating false\r\naccusations, by rendering, or intimidating other judges to render unjust\r\ndecisions, he secured the confiscation of property the value of which he\r\ndiverted to his own pockets. He sold justice to the highest bidder. While\r\nsaving himself expense by defrauding the collectors of port dues of the\r\ntax on his valuables shipped out of Sicily, he added to his profits by the\r\nsale of municipal offices and priesthoods. He entered into partnership\r\nwith the _decumani_ or collectors of the ten per cent produce tax, and\r\nordered the cultivators to pay whatever the collectors demanded, and then,\r\nif dissatisfied, seek redress in his court, a redress which, needless to\r\nsay, was never gained. He loaned public funds at usurious rates of\r\ninterest, and either did not pay in full or paid nothing for corn\r\npurchased from the Sicilian communities for the Roman government, while\r\ncharging the state the market price. At the same time he insisted upon the\r\ncities commuting into money payments at rates far above current prices the\r\ngrain allotted for the upkeep of the governor’s establishment. At times\r\nthe demands made upon cultivators exceeded the total of their annual crop,\r\nand in despair they fled from their holdings. To the money gained by such\r\nmethods Verres added a costly treasure of works of art, which he collected\r\nfrom both individuals and cities by theft, seizure and intimidation. Even\r\nthe sacred ornaments of temples were not spared. All who resisted or\r\ndenounced him, even Roman citizens, were subjected to illegal\r\nimprisonment, torture or execution. These iniquities were carried out in\r\ndefiance of the provincial charter, but there was no power in his province\r\nto restrain him, and the Senate, which should have done so, remained\r\nindifferent to the complaints which were carried to Rome. The sad truth\r\nwas that after all Verres was only more shameless and unscrupulous than\r\nthe average provincial governor, and consequently the sympathies of the\r\nSenate were with him rather than with his victims—the provincials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. THE COMMANDS OF POMPEY AGAINST THE PIRATES AND IN THE EAST: 67–62 B. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n*The pirate scourge.* Both Pompey and Crassus had declined proconsular\r\nappointments at the close of 70 B. C., because there were no provinces\r\nopen which promised an opportunity to augment their influence or military\r\nreputation. Accordingly they remained in Rome watching for some more\r\nfavorable chance to employ their talents. Pompey found such an opportunity\r\nin the ravages of the Cilician pirates. After the failure of Marcus\r\nAntonius (74–72 B. C.), Caecilius Metellus had been sent to Crete in 69\r\nB. C. and in the course of the next two years reduced the island to\r\nsubjection and made it a province. But his operations there did little to\r\ncheck the pirate plague. So bold had these robbers become that they did\r\nnot hesitate to raid the coasts of Italy and to plunder Ostia. When\r\nfinally their depredations interrupted the importation of grain for the\r\nsupply of the city, a famine threatened, and decisive measures had to be\r\ntaken against them.\r\n\r\n*The Gabinian Law, 67 B. C.* The only way to deal with the question was to\r\nappoint a commander with power to operate against the pirates everywhere,\r\nand the obvious man for the position was Pompey. However, the Senate\r\nmistrusted him and in addition feared the consequences of creating such an\r\nextensive extraordinary command. But since 71 B. C. Pompey had stood on\r\nthe side of the _populares_ and now, like Marius, he found in the\r\ntribunate an ally able to aid him in attaining his goal. In 67 B. C. the\r\ntribune Aulus Gabinius proposed a law for the appointment of a single\r\ncommander of consular rank who should have command over the whole sea\r\nwithin the pillars of Hercules and all Roman territory to a distance of\r\nfifty miles inland. His appointment was to be for three years, he was to\r\nhave the power to nominate senatorial _legati_, to raise money in addition\r\nto what he received from the quaestors, and recruit soldiers and sailors\r\nat discretion for his fleet. This command was modelled upon that of\r\nAntonius the praetor in 74 B. C., but conveyed higher authority and\r\ngreater resources. The Senate bitterly resisted the passage of the bill\r\nbut it passed and the Senate had to relinquish its prerogative of creating\r\nthe extraordinary commands. Although no person had been nominated for this\r\ncommand in the law of Gabinius, the opinion of the voters had been so\r\nclearly expressed in a _contio_ that the Senate had to appoint Pompey. He\r\nreceived twenty-four _legati_ and a fleet of five hundred vessels.\r\n\r\n*The pirates crushed.* Pompey set to work energetically and\r\nsystematically. In forty days he swept the pirates from the western\r\nMediterranean. In forty-nine more he cornered them in Cilicia, where he\r\nforced the surrender of their strongholds. His victory was hastened by the\r\nmildness shown to those who surrendered. They received their lives and\r\nfreedom, and in many cases were used as colonists to revive cities with a\r\ndeclining population. Within three months he had brought the pirate war to\r\na triumphant conclusion, but his _imperium_ would not terminate for three\r\nyears and he was anxious to gather fresh laurels.\r\n\r\n*The Manilian Law, 66 B. C.* It so happened that Pompey’s success\r\ncoincided with the temporary check to the Roman arms in Pontus, owing to\r\nthe disaffection of the troops of Lucullus and the machinations of the\r\nlatter’s enemies in Rome. Pompey now sought to have the command of\r\nLucullus added to his own, and in this he had the support of the\r\nequestrian order. Early in 66 B. C. one of the tribunes, Caius Manilius,\r\nproposed a law transferring to Pompey the provinces of Bithynia and\r\nCilicia and the conduct of the war against Mithradates and Tigranes.\r\nCicero, then a praetor, supported the measure in his speech, _For the\r\nManilian Law_. His support was probably dictated by the fact that he was a\r\nman without family backing and consequently had to have the friendship of\r\nan influential personage if he was to secure the political advancement\r\nwhich he desired. The Senate strongly opposed any extension of Pompey’s\r\nmilitary authority, but the bill was passed and he took over the command\r\nof Lucullus. He was clothed with power to make peace or war with whom he\r\nchose, and enjoyed an unexampled concentration of authority in his hands.\r\n\r\n*The campaigns of Pompey in the East.* Pompey at once advanced into Pontus\r\nand attacked Mithradates. The latter was forced to withdraw into Lesser\r\nArmenia where he was overtaken and his army scattered by Pompey. The king\r\nfled to the neighborhood of the Sea of Asov. Upon the defeat of\r\nMithradates, Tigranes deserted his cause and submitted to Pompey. He was\r\npermitted to retain his kingdom as a Roman ally. In the following year, 65\r\nB. C., Pompey reduced to submission the peoples situated south of the\r\nCaucasus, between the Black and the Caspian Seas, who had been in alliance\r\nwith Mithradates, and so completed the subjugation of Pontus, which he\r\nmade into a province (64 B. C.).\r\n\r\nIn 64 B. C. he turned his attention to Syria, where a state of chaos had\r\nreigned since Lucullus had wrested it from Tigranes and where a scion of\r\nthe Seleucids had failed to find recognition. Pompey decided to treat\r\nSyria as a Roman conquest and incorporate it within the empire. He then\r\ninterfered in a dynastic struggle in the kingdom of Judaea. After a brief\r\nstruggle, in which the temple of Jerusalem was stormed by the Romans, he\r\ninstalled his nominee as High Priest at the head of the local government.\r\nJudaea was then annexed to the province of Syria (63 B. C.).\r\n\r\nWhile Pompey was in Judaea the death of Mithradates occurred. Deserted by\r\nthe Greek cities of the northern Euxine, he formed the plan of joining the\r\nCeltic peoples of the Danube valley and invading Italy. But his army\r\ndeserted him for his son Pharnaces, who revolted against his father, and\r\nMithradates committed suicide. Thereupon Pharnaces made peace with Pompey.\r\n\r\nThe Mithradatic war was finally over and Pompey, after organizing affairs\r\nin Asia Minor and the adjoining countries, started on a triumphal return\r\nto Italy with his victorious army and rich spoils of war (62 B. C.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 VI. THE CONSPIRACY OF CATILINE, 63 B. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n*The situation in Rome.* While Pompey was adding to his military\r\nreputation in the East he was regarded with jealous and anxious eyes not\r\nonly by the Senate but also by the other champions of the popular party,\r\nCrassus who found his wealth no match for Pompey’s military achievements,\r\nand Caius Julius Caesar who was rapidly coming to be one of the leading\r\nfigures in Roman public life. Caesar was born in 100 B. C., of the\r\npatrician _gens_ of the Julii, but since his aunt was the wife of Marius,\r\nand he himself had married the daughter of Cinna, his lot was cast with\r\nthe Populares. As a young man he had distinguished himself by refusing to\r\ndivorce his wife at Sulla’s behest, whereat Sulla was with difficulty\r\ninduced to spare his life, saying that he saw in him many a Marius. For\r\nthe time being Caesar judged it prudent to withdraw from Rome to Rhodes.\r\nWhile in the East he was captured by pirates, and after being ransomed,\r\nfulfilled his threat to avenge himself by taking and executing his\r\ncaptors. After the death of Sulla, Caesar returned to Rome and devoted his\r\nmore than average oratorical abilities to the cause of the Marians. In 69\r\nor 68 B. C. he was quaestor in Farther Spain, and shortly afterwards he\r\nbecame closely associated with Crassus in the attempt to develop a\r\ncounterpoise to Pompey’s influence. While aedile in 65 B. C. he curried\r\nfavor with the populace by the extraordinary lavishness with which he\r\ncelebrated the public festivals, by the restoration of the public\r\nmonuments of the campaign of Marius and by supporting the prosecution of\r\nagents in the Sullan proscriptions. The splendor of his shows had obliged\r\nCaesar to contract heavy debts, and Crassus was in all probability his\r\nchief creditor. Both were therefore interested in securing for Caesar a\r\nposition in which he could secure the wealth to meet his obligations.\r\n\r\nThe unrest in Rome was heightened by the presence there of a number of men\r\nof ruined fortunes, both Marians dispossessed by Sulla and those of the\r\nopposite party who had squandered their resources or had been excluded\r\nfrom the Senate by the censors of 70 B. C. This element was ready to\r\nresort to any means, however desperate, to win wealth or office. Foremost\r\namong them was Lucius Sergius Catilina, a patrician who enjoyed an evil\r\nrepute for his share in the Sullan proscriptions and the viciousness of\r\nhis private life. Symptomatic of the weakening of the public authority was\r\nthe organization of partizan gangs to terrorize opposition and control the\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\n*Cicero elected consul, 64 B. C.* In the year 64 B. C. three candidates\r\npresented themselves for the consulship, Catiline, Caius Antonius, a noble\r\nof the same type as Catiline, and Cicero. The first two were supported by\r\nCaesar and Crassus who hoped to use them for their own ends. Cicero, as a\r\n_novus homo_, was distasteful to the Optimates, but since they felt that\r\nCatiline must be defeated at all costs they supported the orator, who was\r\nelected with Antonius. From that time Cicero ranged himself on the side of\r\nthe Optimates, and his political watchword was the “harmony of the\r\norders,” that is, of the senators and the equestrians. Of the consular\r\nprovinces Cicero received by lot Macedonia and Antonius Cisalpine Gaul. As\r\nthe latter was dissatisfied Cicero resigned Macedonia to him, in return\r\nfor his public assurance of abstaining from opposing Cicero’s acts during\r\ntheir year of office.\r\n\r\n*The land bill of Rullus, 63 B. C.* On the first day of his consulate\r\nCicero delivered a speech in which he scathingly criticized a land bill\r\nproposed by the tribune Servilius Rullus. This bill aimed to create a land\r\ncommission of ten members of praetorian rank, elected in a special\r\n_comitia_ of seventeen tribes, which Rullus was to choose by lot. These\r\ncommissioners were to be vested with extraordinary powers for five years,\r\nincluding the right to sell the public land in Italy and in Pompey’s\r\nrecent conquests, to exercise judicial authority, to confiscate lands, to\r\nfound colonies, and to enroll and maintain troops. The bill would have\r\nplaced in the hands of the commissioners extraordinary military authority\r\nboth in Italy and in the provinces, guaranteed by the income derived from\r\nthe sale of land. Pompey was excluded from the commission by a clause\r\nrequiring the personal appearance of candidates. Everyone was aware that\r\nthe measure was devised in the interests of Caesar and Crassus and that\r\nthey would dominate the commission. However, the attack upon the Senate’s\r\ncontrol of the public land and the general mistrust of the purposes of a\r\nbill of this sort caused such strong opposition that its sponsors did not\r\nbring the matter to a vote.\r\n\r\n*Caesar, **Pontifex** Maximus.* But Caesar could console himself with\r\nvictory in another sphere. The position of Pontifex Maximus had become\r\nvacant, and by a tribunician bill the _lex Domitia_, revoked by Sulla, was\r\nagain brought into effect and election to the priesthood entrusted to a\r\n_comitia_ of seventeen tribes. In the ensuing election Caesar was\r\nvictorious.\r\n\r\n*The Catilinarian conspiracy: 63 B. C.* In July, 63 B. C., occurred the\r\nconsular elections for the next year. Catiline was again a competitor, but\r\nnow he lacked the support of Crassus and Caesar and appealed directly to\r\nall needy and desperate characters throughout Italy, who hoped to enrich\r\nthemselves by violent means. He was bitterly opposed by Cicero and the\r\nOptimates and was defeated. Thereupon he and his followers conspired to\r\noverthrow the government by armed force. Cicero, who was on the watch, got\r\nnews of the conspiracy and induced the Senate to pass the “last decree”\r\nempowering him to use any means to save the state. Catiline then left the\r\ncity to join the bands his supporters had raised in Etruria. He was\r\ndeclared a public enemy and a force under the consul Antonius dispatched\r\nagainst him. December seventeenth was the day set for a rising in Rome,\r\nwhen the city was to be fired, the consuls and others murdered, and a\r\nreign of terror instituted. But the plan was betrayed by a delegation of\r\nthe Gallic Allobroges who happened to be in Rome and whom the conspirators\r\nendeavored to enlist on their side. The leading Catilinarians in Rome were\r\narrested, and, in accordance with a decree of the Senate, put to death.\r\nCaesar had argued for a milder sentence, but the firm stand of the young\r\nMarcus Porcius Cato, a man of uncompromising uprightness and loyalty to\r\nthe constitution, sealed the fate of the plotters. Upon the failure of his\r\nplans in Rome, Catiline endeavored to make his way with his army into\r\nCisalpine Gaul, but was overtaken and forced to give battle to the forces\r\nof Antonius at Pistoria. He and most of his followers died sword in hand.\r\nThe suppression of the conspiracy added to Cicero’s reputation and greatly\r\nstrengthened the position of the Senate and the Optimates.\r\n\r\nBut the whole episode bears testimony to the general weakness of the\r\ngovernment and the danger of the absence of a regular police force for the\r\nmaintenance of the public peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        VII. THE COALITION OF POMPEY, CAESAR AND CRASSUS: 60 B. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Pompey’s return.* Towards the close of the year 62 B. C. Pompey landed in\r\nItaly and, contrary to the expectations of those who feared that he would\r\nprove a second Sulla, disbanded his army. The following September (61) he\r\ncelebrated a memorable triumph. He was exceedingly anxious to crown his\r\nachievements by having the Senate ratify his eastern arrangements and\r\nsecuring land grants for his veterans. However, since the dismissal of his\r\ntroops he was no longer feared by the Senate, which insisted on examining\r\nhis acts in detail and not ratifying them _en bloc_ as he demanded. Thus\r\nthe Optimates lost the opportunity of binding Pompey to their side, and at\r\nthe same time they fell out with the equestrians over the demand made by\r\nthe _publicani_ who had contracted for the taxes of Asia for a\r\nmodification of the terms of their contract on the ground of poor harvests\r\nin the province.\r\n\r\n*The coalition of 60 B. C.* No settlement had been reached when Caesar\r\nreturned to Rome in 60 B. C. He had been praetor in 62 and for the\r\nfollowing year governor of Further Spain, where he waged successful border\r\nwars, conciliated the provincials and yet contrived to find the means to\r\nsatisfy his creditors. He now requested a triumph and the privilege of\r\nstanding for the consulate while waiting outside the city for the former\r\nhonor. However, when the Senate delayed its decision he gave up the\r\ntriumph and became a candidate for the consulate. He now succeeded in\r\nreconciling Pompey and Crassus and the three formed a secret coalition to\r\nsecure the election of Caesar and the satisfaction of their particular\r\naims. This unofficial coalition is known as the First Triumvirate. Through\r\nthe influence of his supporters Caesar was easily elected but his\r\ncolleague was Calpurnius Bibulus, the nominee of the Optimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n\r\n   THE RIVALRY OF POMPEY AND CAESAR: CAESAR’S DICTATORSHIP; 59–44 B. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        I. CAESAR CONSUL: 59 B. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n*A rule of force.* At the beginning of his consulship Caesar tried to\r\ninduce the Senate to approve his measures, but, when they failed to do so,\r\nhe carried them directly to the Assembly. And when Bibulus and Cato\r\nessayed to obstruct legislation in the Comitia he crushed all opposition\r\nby the aid of Pompey’s veterans. Bibulus, protesting against the\r\nillegality of Caesar’s proceedings, shut himself up in his own house. Thus\r\nCaesar carried two land laws for the benefit of the soldiers of Pompey,\r\ninduced the Senate to ratify the latter’s eastern settlement, and secured\r\nfor the equestrians, whose cause was championed by Crassus, the remission\r\nof one third of the contract price for the revenues of Asia.\r\n\r\n*The Vatinian Law.* A lucky chance enabled Caesar to secure his own future\r\nby an extended military command. The Senate had taken pains to render him\r\nharmless by assigning as the consular provinces for 58 the care of forests\r\nand country roads in Italy, but in February, 59, the death of Metellus\r\nCeler, proconsul of Cisalpine Gaul, left vacant a post of considerable\r\nimportance in view of the imminent danger of war breaking out in\r\nTransalpine Gaul. Accordingly a law proposed by the tribune Vatinius\r\ntransferred to Caesar the command of Cisalpine Gaul and Illyricum, with a\r\ngarrison of three legions, for a term of five years beginning 1 March, 59.\r\nTo this the Senate, at the suggestion of Pompey, added Transalpine Gaul\r\nand another legion.\r\n\r\n*The banishment of Cicero, 58 B. C.* Caesar’s consulship had been an open\r\ndefiance of constitutional precedent, and had revealed the fact that the\r\ntriumvirate was stronger than the established organs of government, and\r\nthat the Roman Empire was really controlled by three men. Well might Cato\r\nsay that the coalition was the beginning of the end of the Republic.\r\nWithin the triumvirate itself Pompey was the dominant figure owing to his\r\nmilitary renown and the influence of his veterans. Caesar appeared as his\r\nagent, yet displayed far greater political insight and succeeded in\r\ncreating for himself a position which would enable him to play a more\r\nindependent rôle in the future. The coalition did not break up at the end\r\nof Caesar’s consulship; its members determined to retain their control of\r\nthe state policy, and to this end secured for 58 B. C. the election of two\r\nconsuls in whom they had confidence. To cement the alliance Pompey married\r\nCaesar’s daughter Julia, and Caesar married the daughter of Piso, one of\r\nthe consuls-elect. To secure themselves from attack they felt it necessary\r\nto remove from the city their two ablest opponents, Cato and Cicero. The\r\nlatter had refused all proposals to join their side, and had sharply\r\ncriticized them on several public occasions. His banishment was secured\r\nthrough the agency of the tribune Clodius, whose transfer from patrician\r\nto plebeian status Caesar had facilitated. Clodius was a man of ill repute\r\nwho hated Cicero because the latter had testified against him when he was\r\non trial for sacrilege. Early in 58 B. C. Clodius carried a bill which\r\noutlawed any person who had put to death Roman citizens without regular\r\njudicial proceedings. This law was aimed at Cicero for his share in the\r\nexecution of the Catalinarian conspirators. Finding that he could not rely\r\nupon the support of his friends, Cicero went into exile without awaiting\r\ntrial. He was formally banished, his property was confiscated, and he\r\nhimself sought refuge in Thessalonica, where the governor of Macedonia\r\noffered him protection. Cato was entrusted with a special mission to\r\naccomplish the incorporation of Cyprus, then ruled by one of the Egyptian\r\nPtolemies, into the Roman Empire, and his Stoic conception of duty\r\nprevented him from refusing the appointment. Caesar remained with his army\r\nin the vicinity of Rome until after Cicero’s banishment and then set out\r\nfor his province.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                II. CAESAR’S CONQUEST OF GAUL: 58–51 B. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n*The defeat of the Helvetii and Ariovistus: 58 B. C.* In 58 B. C., when\r\nCaesar entered upon his Gallic command, the Roman province in Transalpine\r\nGaul (_Gallia __Narbonensis_) embraced the coast districts from the Alps\r\nto the borders of Spain and the land between the Alps and the Rhone as far\r\nnorth as Lake Geneva. The country which stretched from the Pyrenees to the\r\nRhine, and from the Rhone to the ocean was called _Gallia comata_ or\r\n“long-haired Gaul,” and was occupied by a large number of peoples of\r\nvarying importance. These were usually regarded as falling into three\r\ngroups, (1) those of Aquitania, between the Pyrenees and the Loire, where\r\nthere was a large Iberian element, (2) those called Celts, in a narrow\r\nsense of the word, stretching from the Loire to the Seine and the Marne,\r\nand (3) the Belgian Gauls, dwelling between these rivers and the Rhine.\r\nAmong the latter were peoples of Germanic origin. Although conscious of a\r\ngeneral unity of language, race and customs, the Gauls had not developed a\r\nnational state, owing to the mutual jealousy of the individual peoples,\r\nand each tribe was perpetually divided into rival factions supporting\r\ndifferent chiefs. Rome had sought to protect the province of Narbonensis\r\nby establishing friendly relations with some of these Gallic peoples and\r\nhad long before (c. 121 B. C.) made an alliance with the Aedui. About 70\r\nB. C. conditions in _Gallia comata_ had been disturbed by an invasion of\r\nGermanic Suevi, from across the Rhine, under their King Ariovistus. He\r\nunited with the rivals of the Aedui, the Sequani, and after a number of\r\nyears reduced the former to submission. In 59 B. C. he reached an\r\nagreement with Rome, became a “friend” of the Roman people, and, while\r\nabstaining from further aggression, remained firmly established in what is\r\nnow Alsace. For some time the Roman province had been alarmed by the\r\nthreat of a migration of the Helvetii, then settled in western\r\nSwitzerland, and in March, 58 B. C., this people started in search of new\r\nabodes. Caesar reached Gaul in time to prevent their crossing the upper\r\nRhone, and followed them as they turned westward into the lands of the\r\nSequani and Aedui. Defeated in two battles, they were forced to return to\r\ntheir home and to become allies of Rome. The movement of the Helvetii had\r\ngiven Caesar the opportunity for intervention in _Gallia comata_, and a\r\npretext for extending his influence there was found in the hostility of\r\nsome of the Gauls to Ariovistus, and the knowledge that a band of Suevi\r\nwas expected soon to cross the Rhine to reinforce the latter. To frustrate\r\na German occupation of Gaul now became Caesar’s object. Ariovistus\r\nrejected the demands of Caesar, who thereupon attacked him, defeated him\r\nin the vicinity of Strassburg and drove him across the Rhine. Caesar was\r\nnow the dominant power in Gaul, and many of the leading tribes entered\r\ninto alliance with Rome. Of the Belgae, however, only the Remi came over\r\nto the side of Rome.\r\n\r\n*The conquest of the Belgae, Veneti, and Aquitanians, 57–56 B. C.* In the\r\nnext year, 57 B. C., Caesar marched against the united forces of the\r\nBelgae, defeated them, and subdued many tribes, chief of whom were the\r\nNervii. At the same time his legates received the submission of the\r\npeoples of Normandy and Brittany. In the course of the following winter\r\nsome of these, led by the Veneti, broke off their alliance and attacked\r\nCaesar’s garrisons. Thereupon he set to work to build a fleet, with which\r\nin the course of the next summer the fleet of the Veneti was destroyed and\r\ntheir strongholds on the coast taken (56 B. C.). The same year witnessed\r\nthe submission of the Aquitanians, which brought practically the whole of\r\nGaul under Roman sway.\r\n\r\n*Events in Rome, 58–55 B. C.* Meanwhile important changes had taken place\r\nin the situation at Rome. Pompey had broken with Clodius, and supported\r\nthe tribune Titus Annius Milo who pressed for Cicero’s recall. A law of\r\nthe Assembly withdrew his sentence of outlawry, his property was restored,\r\nand the orator returned in September, 57 B. C., to enjoy a warm reception\r\nboth in the municipal towns and at the capital. For the moment Pompey and\r\nthe Optimates were on friendly terms, and the former made use of a grain\r\nfamine in the city to secure for himself an appointment as curator of the\r\ngrain supply (_curator annonae_) for a period of five years. This\r\nappointment carried with it proconsular _imperium_ within and without\r\nItaly, and the control of the ports, markets and traffic in grain within\r\nthe Roman dominions. It was really an extraordinary military command.\r\nPompey relieved the situation but could do nothing to allay the disorders\r\nin Rome, where Clodius and Milo with their armed gangs set law and order\r\nat defiance. The news of Caesar’s victories and the influence which he was\r\nacquiring in the city by a judicious distribution of the spoils of war\r\nfired the ambitions of Pompey and Crassus who were no longer on good terms\r\nwith one another. Furthermore, the return of Cato in 56 B. C. had again\r\ngiven the Optimates an energetic leader. Consequently Caesar felt it\r\nnecessary for the coalition to reach a new agreement. Accordingly while\r\nspending the winter in Cisalpine Gaul he arranged a conference at Luca in\r\nApril, 56, where the three settled their differences and laid plans for\r\nthe future. They agreed that Pompey and Crassus should be consuls in 55\r\nB. C., that the former should be given the Spanish provinces and Libya for\r\nfive years, that Crassus should have Syria for an equal period, and that\r\nCaesar’s command in Gaul should be prolonged for another five year term to\r\nrun from 1 March, 54.(12)\r\n\r\nThese arrangements were duly carried out. Since it was too late for Pompey\r\nand Crassus to be candidates at the regular elections in 56 B. C., they\r\nforcibly prevented any elections being held that year. The following\r\nJanuary, after forcing the other candidates to withdraw, they secured\r\ntheir election. Thereupon a law of the tribune Gaius Trebonius made\r\neffective the assignment of provinces agreed upon at Luca. Once more it\r\nwas made plain that the coalition actually ruled the empire. Cicero, who\r\nwas indebted to Pompey for his recall, was forced to support the\r\ntriumvirate, and the Optimates found their boldest leader in Cato, who had\r\nreturned to Rome early in 56 B. C.\r\n\r\n*Caesar’s crossing of the Rhine and invasion of Britain: 55–54 B. C.*\r\nDuring the winter following the subjugation of the Veneti, two Germanic\r\ntribes, the Usipetes and the Tencteri, crossed the lower Rhine into Gaul.\r\nIn the next summer, 55 B. C., Caesar attacked and annihilated their\r\nforces, only a few escaping across the river. As a warning against future\r\ninvasion, Caesar bridged the Rhine and made a demonstration upon the right\r\nbank, destroying his bridge when he withdrew. Towards the close of the\r\nsummer he crossed the Straits of Dover to Britain, to punish the Britons\r\nfor aiding his enemies in Gaul. But owing to the lateness of the season\r\nand the smallness of his force he returned to Gaul after a brief\r\nreconnaissance.\r\n\r\nIn the following year, after gathering a larger fleet, he again landed on\r\nthe island with a force of almost 30,000 men. This time he forced his way\r\nacross the Thames and received the submission of Cassivellaunus, the chief\r\nwho led the British tribes against the invaders. After taking hostages,\r\nand receiving promises of tribute, Caesar returned to Gaul. Britain was in\r\nno sense subdued, but the island had felt the power of Rome, and, besides\r\nenlarging the geographical knowledge of the time, Caesar had brought back\r\nnumbers of captives. In Rome the exploit produced great excitement and\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\n*Revolts in Gaul: 54–53 B. C.* Although the Gauls had submitted to Caesar,\r\nthey were not yet reconciled to Roman rule, which put an end to their\r\ninter-tribal wars and to the feuds among the nobility. Consequently, many\r\nof the tribes were restive and not inclined to surrender all hopes of\r\nfreedom without another struggle. In the course of the winter 54–53 B. C.\r\nthe Nervii, Treveri and Eburones in Belgian Gaul attacked the Roman\r\ndetachments stationed in their territories. One of these was cut to pieces\r\nbut the rest held their ground until relieved by Caesar, who stamped out\r\nthe rebellion.\r\n\r\n*Vercingetorix, 52 B. C.* A more serious movement started in 52 B. C.\r\namong the peoples of central Gaul who found a national leader in\r\nVercingetorix, a young noble of the Arverni. The revolt took Caesar by\r\nsurprise when he was in Cisalpine Gaul and his troops still scattered in\r\nwinter quarters. He recrossed the Alps with all haste, secured the\r\nNarbonese province and succeeded in uniting his forces. These he\r\nstrengthened with German cavalry from across the Rhine. However, a\r\ntemporary check in an attack upon the position of Vercingetorix at\r\nGergovia caused the Aedui to desert the Roman cause, and the revolt spread\r\nto practically the whole of Gaul. Caesar was on the point of retiring to\r\nthe province, but after repulsing an attack made upon him he was able to\r\npen up Vercingetorix in the fortress of Alesia. A great effort made by the\r\nGauls to relieve the siege failed to break Caesar’s lines, and the\r\ndefenders were starved into submission. The crisis was over, although\r\nanother year was required before the revolting tribes were all reduced to\r\nsubmission and the Roman authority re-established (51 B. C.). Caesar used\r\nall possible mildness in his treatment of the conquered and the Gauls were\r\nnot only pacified but won over. In the days to come they were among his\r\nmost loyal supporters. The conquest of Gaul was an event of supreme\r\nimportance for the future history of the Roman empire, and for the\r\ndevelopment of European civilization as well. For the time _Gallia comata_\r\nwas not formed into a province. Its peoples were made allies of Rome,\r\nunder the supervision of the governor of Narbonese Gaul, under obligation\r\nto furnish troops and for the most part liable to a fixed tribute.\r\nCaesar’s campaign in Gaul had given him the opportunity to develop his\r\nunusual military talents and to create a veteran army devoted to himself.\r\nHis power had become so great that both Pompey and the Optimates desired\r\nhis destruction and he was in a position to refuse to be eliminated\r\nwithout a struggle. The plots laid in Rome to deprive him of his power had\r\nmade him hasten to quell the revolt of the Gauls with all speed. When this\r\nwas accomplished he was free to turn his attention to Roman affairs.\r\n\r\n*Crassus in Syria, 55–53 B. C.* After the assignment of the provinces by\r\nthe Trebonian Law in 55 B. C., Crassus set out for Syria intending to win\r\nmilitary power and prestige by a war against the Parthians, an Asiatic\r\npeople who, once the subjects of the Persians and Seleucids, had\r\nestablished a kingdom which included the provinces of the Seleucid empire\r\nas far west as the Euphrates. Crassus had no real excuse for opening\r\nhostilities, but the Parthians were a potentially dangerous neighbor and a\r\ncampaign against them gave promise of profit and glory. Accordingly, in 54\r\nB. C., Crassus made a short incursion into Mesopotamia and then withdrew\r\nto Syria. The next year he again crossed the Euphrates, intending to\r\npenetrate deeply into the enemy’s country. But he had underestimated the\r\nstrength of the Parthians and the difficulties of desert warfare. In the\r\nMesopotamian desert near Carrhae his troops were surrounded and cut to\r\npieces by the Parthian horsemen; Crassus himself was enticed into a\r\nconference and treacherously slain, and only a small remnant of his force\r\nescaped (53 B. C.). But the Parthians were slow in following up their\r\nadvantage and Crassus’ quaestor, Cassius Longinus, was able to hold Syria.\r\nStill Roman prestige in the East had received a severe blow and for the\r\nnext three centuries the Romans found the Parthians dangerous neighbors.\r\nThe death of Crassus tended to hasten a crisis in Rome for it brought into\r\nsharp conflict the incompatible ambitions of Pompey and Caesar, whose\r\nestrangement had already begun with the death of Pompey’s wife Julia in 54\r\nB. C.\r\n\r\n*Affairs in Rome, 54–49 B. C.* At the end of his consulship Pompey left\r\nRome but remained in Italy, on the pretext of his curatorship of the grain\r\nsupply, and governed his province through his legates. In Rome disorder\r\nreigned; no consuls were elected in 54 B. C. nor before July of the\r\nfollowing year; the partizans of Clodius and Milo kept everything in\r\nconfusion. Pompey could have restored order but preferred to create a\r\nsituation which would force the Senate to grant him new powers, so he\r\nbacked Clodius, while Milo championed the Optimates. Owing to broils\r\nbetween the supporters of the candidates, no consuls or praetors could be\r\nelected for 52 B. C. In January of that year Clodius was slain by Milo’s\r\nbody-guard on the Appian Way, and the ensuing outburst of mob violence in\r\nthe city forced the Senate to appeal to Pompey. He was made sole consul,\r\nuntil he should choose a colleague, and was entrusted with the task of\r\nrestoring order. His troops brought quiet into the city; Milo was tried on\r\na charge of public violence, convicted, and banished. Pompey had attained\r\nthe height of his official career; he was sole consul, at the same time he\r\nhad a province embracing the Spains, Libya, and the sphere assigned to him\r\nwith the grain curatorship, he governed his provinces through _legati_,\r\nand his armies were maintained by the public treasury. In reality he was\r\nthe chief power in the state, for without him the Senate was helpless, and\r\nhe was justly regarded by contemporaries as the First Citizen or Princeps.\r\nIn many ways his position foreshadowed the Principate of Augustus.\r\nHowever, Pompey did not wish to overthrow the republican régime; his\r\nambition was to be regarded as the indispensable and permanent mainstay of\r\nthe government and to enjoy corresponding power and honor. In such a\r\nscheme there was no room for a rival, and therefore he determined upon\r\nCaesar’s overthrow. This decision put him on the side of the extreme\r\nOptimates, who were alarmed by Caesar’s wealth, influence and fame and\r\nfeared him as a dangerous radical. They had no hesitation in choosing\r\nbetween Pompey and Caesar.\r\n\r\n*Pompey’s attack upon Caesar: 52 B. C.* The latter’s immediate aim was to\r\nsecure the consulship for 48 B. C. and to retain his proconsular command\r\nuntil the end of December, 49. He knew that he had reached a position\r\nwhere his destruction was the desire of many, and that the moment he\r\nsurrendered his _imperium_ he would be open to prosecution by those\r\nseeking to procure his ruin. But he had no intention of placing himself in\r\nthe power of his enemies. The consulship would not only save him from\r\nprosecution but would enable him to confirm his arrangements in Gaul,\r\nreward his army, and secure his own future by another proconsular\r\nappointment. However, to secure his election, he had to be exempted from\r\npresenting himself in person for his candidature in 49, and this\r\npermission was accorded him by a tribunician law early in 52 B. C. So far\r\nhis position was strictly legal, but Pompey, whose own consulship was\r\nunconstitutional, now broke openly with Caesar by passing legislation\r\nwhich would undermine the latter’s position. One of Pompey’s laws\r\nprohibited candidacies for office _in absentia_, and when Caesar’s friends\r\nprotested, he added to the text of the law after it had passed a clause\r\nexempting Caesar from its operation; a procedure of more than dubious\r\nlegality. A second law provided that in future provincial governorships\r\nshould not be filled by the city magistrates just completing their term of\r\noffice but by those whose terms had expired five years previously. This\r\nlatter law may have been intended to check the mad rivalry for provincial\r\nappointments, but its immediate significance lay in the fact that it\r\npermitted a successor to be appointed to take over Caesar’s provinces on 1\r\nMarch, 49 B. C. He would thus have to stand as a private citizen for the\r\nconsulship and would no longer enjoy immunity from legal attack. At the\r\nsame time Pompey had his own command in Spain extended for another five\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n*Negotiations between Caesar, Pompey and the Senate, 51–50 B. C.* The\r\nquestion of appointing a successor to Caesar’s provinces filled the next\r\ntwo years and was the immediate cause of civil war. Caesar claimed that\r\nhis position should not be affected by the Pompeian law, and pressed for\r\npermission to hold his command until the close of 49 B. C. The extreme\r\nconservatives sought to supersede him on March first of that year, but\r\nCaesar’s friends and agents thwarted their efforts. Pompey was not willing\r\nto have Caesar’s command to run beyond 13 November, 49. Cicero, who had\r\ndistinguished himself by his uprightness as governor of Cilicia in 51,\r\nstrove to effect a compromise, but in vain. Caesar offered to give up\r\nTransalpine Gaul and part of his army, if allowed to retain the Cisalpine\r\nprovince but the overture was rejected. Finally, in December, 50 B. C., he\r\nformally promised to resign his provinces and disband his troops, if\r\nPompey would do the same, but the Senate insisted upon his absolute\r\nsurrender. On 7 January, 49 B. C., the Senate passed the “last decree”\r\ncalling upon the magistrates and proconsuls (i. e. Pompey) to protect the\r\nstate, and declaring Caesar a public enemy. Caesar’s friends left the city\r\nand fled to meet him in Cisalpine Gaul, where he and his army were in\r\nreadiness for this emergency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      III. THE CIVIL WAR BETWEEN CAESAR AND THE SENATE: 49–46 B. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Caesar’s conquest of Italy and Spain, 49 B. C.* The senatorial\r\nconservatives had forced the issue and for Caesar there remained the\r\nalternative of victory or destruction. He possessed the advantages of a\r\nloyal army ready for immediate action and the undisputed control over his\r\nown troops. On the other hand, his opponents had no veteran troops in\r\nItaly, and although Pompey acted as commander-in-chief of the senatorial\r\nforces, he was greatly hampered by having at times to defer to the\r\njudgment of the consuls and senators who were in his camp. It was\r\nobviously to Caesar’s advantage to take the offensive and to force a\r\ndecision before his enemies could concentrate against him the resources of\r\nthe provinces. Hence he determined to act without delay, and, upon\r\nreceiving news of the Senate’s action on 7 January, he crossed the\r\nRubicon, which divided Cisalpine Gaul and Italy, with a small force,\r\nordering the legions beyond the Alps to join him with all speed. The\r\nItalian municipalities opened their gates at his approach and the newly\r\nraised levies went over to his side. Everywhere his mildness to his\r\nopponents won him new adherents. Pompey decided to abandon Italy and\r\nwithdraw to the East, intending later to concentrate upon the peninsula\r\nfrom all sides; a plan made feasible by his control of the sea. Caesar\r\ndivined his intention and tried to cut off his retreat at Brundisium, but\r\ncould not prevent his embarkation. With his army and the majority of the\r\nSenate Pompey crossed to Epirus. Owing to his lack of a fleet Caesar could\r\nnot follow and returned to Rome. There some of the magistrates were still\r\nfunctioning, in conjunction with a remnant of the Senate. Being in dire\r\nneed of money, he wished to obtain funds from the treasury, and when this\r\nwas opposed by a tribune, Caesar ignored the latter’s veto and forcibly\r\nseized the reserve treasure which the Pompeians had left behind in their\r\nhasty flight. In the meantime Caesar’s lieutenants had seized Sardinia and\r\nSicily, and crossed over into Africa. He himself determined to attack the\r\nwell organized Pompeian forces in Spain and destroy them before Pompey was\r\nready for an offensive from the East. On his way to Spain, Caesar began\r\nthe siege of Massalia which closed its gates to him. Leaving the city\r\nunder blockade he hastened to Spain, where after an initial defeat he\r\nforced the surrender of the Pompeian armies. Some of the prisoners joined\r\nhis forces; the rest were dismissed to their homes. Caesar hastened back\r\nto Massalia. The city capitulated at his arrival, and was punished by\r\nrequisitions, the loss of its territory and the temporary deprivation of\r\nits autonomy. From here Caesar pressed on to Rome, where he had been\r\nappointed dictator by virtue of a special law. After holding the elections\r\nin which he and an approved colleague were returned as consuls for 48, he\r\nresigned his dictatorship and set out for Brundisium. There he had\r\nassembled his army and transports for the passage to Epirus.\r\n\r\n*Pharsalus, 48 B. C.* During Caesar’s Spanish campaign Pompey had gathered\r\na large force in Macedonia, nine Roman legions reinforced by contingents\r\nfrom the Roman allies. His fleet, recruited largely from the maritime\r\ncities in the East, commanded the Adriatic. Nevertheless, at the opening\r\nof winter (Nov. 49 B. C.) Caesar effected a landing on the coast of Epirus\r\nwith part of his army and seized Apollonia. However, Pompey arrived from\r\nMacedonia in time to save Dyrrhachium. Throughout the winter the two\r\narmies remained inactive, but Pompey’s fleet prevented Caesar from\r\nreceiving reinforcements until the spring of 48 B. C., when Marcus\r\nAntonius effected a crossing with another detachment. As Caesar’s troops\r\nbegan to suffer from shortage of supplies he was forced to take the\r\noffensive and tried to blockade Pompey’s larger force in Dyrrhachium.\r\nHowever, the attempt failed, his lines of investment were broken, and he\r\nwithdrew to Thessaly. Thither he was followed by Pompey, who suffered\r\nhimself to be influenced by the overconfident senators to risk a battle.\r\nNear the town of Old Pharsalus he attacked Caesar but was defeated and his\r\narmy dispersed. He himself sought refuge in Egypt and there he was put to\r\ndeath by order of the king whose father he had protected in the days of\r\nhis power. Pompey’s great weakness was that his resolution did not match\r\nhis ambition. His ambition led him to seek a position incompatible with\r\nthe constitution; but his lack of resolution did not permit him to\r\noverthrow the constitution. The Optimates had sided with him only because\r\nthey held him less dangerous than Caesar and had he been victorious they\r\nwould have sought to compass his downfall.\r\n\r\n*Caesar in the East, 48–47 B. C.* After Pharsalus Caesar had set out in\r\npursuit of Pompey, but arrived in Egypt after the murder of his foe. His\r\never pressing need of money probably induced Caesar to intervene as\r\narbiter in the name of Rome in the dynastic struggle then raging in Egypt\r\nbetween the twenty-year-old Cleopatra and her thirteen-year-old brother,\r\nPtolemy XIV Dionysus, who was also, following the Egyptian custom, her\r\nhusband. Caesar got the young king in his power and brought back\r\nCleopatra, whom the people of Alexandria had driven out. Angered thereat,\r\nand resenting his exactions, the Alexandrians rose in arms and from\r\nOctober, 48, to March, 47 B. C., besieged Caesar in the royal quarter of\r\nthe city. Having but few troops with him Caesar was in dire straits and\r\nwas only able to maintain himself through his control of the sea which\r\nenabled him to eventually receive reinforcements. His relief was effected\r\nby a force raised by Mithradates of Pergamon who invaded Egypt from Syria.\r\nIn co-operation with him Caesar defeated the Egyptians in battle; Ptolemy\r\nDionysus perished in flight; and Alexandria submitted. Cleopatra was\r\nmarried to a still younger brother and put in possession of the kingdom of\r\nEgypt. Caesar had succumbed to the charms of the Egyptian queen and\r\ntarried in her company for the rest of the winter. He was called away to\r\nface a new danger in Pharnaces, son of Mithradates Eupator, who had taken\r\nadvantage of the civil war to recover Pontus and overrun Lesser Armenia,\r\nCappadocia and Bithynia. Hastening through Syria Caesar entered Pontus and\r\ndefeated Pharnaces at Zela. After settling affairs in Asia Minor he\r\nproceeded with all speed to the West, where his presence was urgently\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\n*Thapsus, 46 B. C.* Both the fleet and the army of Pompey had dispersed\r\nafter Pharsalus, but Caesar’s delay in the East had given the republicans\r\nan opportunity to reassemble their forces. They gathered in Africa where\r\nCaesar’s lieutenant Curio, who had invaded the province in 49 B. C., had\r\nbeen defeated and killed by the Pompeians through the aid of King Juba of\r\nNumidia. From Africa they were now preparing to attack Italy. In Rome,\r\nCaesar had been appointed dictator for 47 B. C. with Antony as his master\r\nof the horse. Here disorder reigned as a result of the distress arising\r\nfrom the financial stringency brought on by the war. Antony, who was in\r\nRome, had proved unable to deal with the situation. Caesar reached Italy\r\nin September, 47 B. C., and soon restored order in the city. He was then\r\ncalled upon to face a serious mutiny of his troops who demanded the\r\nfulfillment of his promises of money and land and their release from\r\nservice. By boldness and presence of mind Caesar won them back to their\r\nallegiance and set out for Africa in December, 47 B. C. He landed with\r\nonly a portion of his troops and at first was defeated by the republicans\r\nunder Scipio and Juba. But he was supported by King Bogud of Mauretania\r\nand a Catalinarian soldier of fortune, Publius Sittius, and after\r\nreceiving reinforcements from Italy he besieged the seaport Thapsus.\r\nScipio came to the rescue but was completely defeated in a bloody battle\r\nnear the town. The whole of the province fell into Caesar’s hands. Cato,\r\nwho was in command of Utica, did not force the citizens to resist but\r\ncommitted suicide; the other republican leaders, including Juba, either\r\nfollowed his example, or were taken and executed by the Caesarians. From\r\nAfrica Caesar returned to Rome where he celebrated a costly triumph over\r\nGaul, Egypt, Pharnaces and Juba. He was now undisputed master of the state\r\nand proceeded according to his own judgment to settle the problem of\r\ngoverning the Roman world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            IV. THE DICTATORSHIP OF JULIUS CAESAR: 46–44 B. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n*The problem of imperial government.* From 28 July, 46, to 15 March, 44\r\nB. C., Caesar ruled the Roman Empire with despotic power, his position\r\nunchallenged except for a revolt of the Pompeian party in Spain which\r\nrequired his attention from the autumn of 46 to the spring of 45 B. C. His\r\nvictory over Pompey and the republicans had placed upon him the obligation\r\nto provide the empire with a stable form of government and this\r\nresponsibility he accepted. Sulla, when faced with the same problem, had\r\nbeen content to place the Senate once more at the head of the state, but\r\nfrom his own experience Caesar knew how futile this policy had been. Nor\r\ncould the ideal of Pompey commend itself as a means of ending civil war\r\nand rebellion. Caesar was prepared to deal much more radically with the\r\nold régime, but death overtook him before he had completed his\r\nreorganization. What was the goal of his policy will best be understood\r\nfrom a consideration of his official position during the year and a half\r\nwhich followed the battle of Thapsus.\r\n\r\n*Caesar’s offices, powers and honors.* Caesar’s autocratic position rested\r\nin the last instance upon the support of his veterans, of the associates\r\nwho owed their advancement to him, and of such small forces as he kept\r\nunder arms, but his position was legalized by the accumulation in his\r\nhands of various offices, special powers and unusual honors. Foremost\r\namong his offices came the dictatorship. We have seen that he had held\r\nthis already for a short time in 49 and again in 47. In 46 B. C. he was\r\nappointed dictator for ten years, and in the following year for life. At\r\nthe same time he was consul, an office which he held continuously from 48\r\nB. C., in 45 as sole consul, but usually with a colleague. In addition to\r\nthese offices he enjoyed the tribunician authority (_tribunicia\r\npotestas_), that is, the power of the tribunes without the name. This\r\nincluded the right to sit with the tribunes and the right of intercession,\r\ngranted him as early as 48 B. C., and also personal inviolability\r\n(_sacrosanctitas_) which he received in 45. He had been Chief Pontiff\r\nsince 63, and in 48 B. C. was admitted to all the patrician priestly\r\ncorporations. And in 46 B. C. he was given the powers of the censorship\r\nunder the title of “prefect of morals” (_praefectus morum_), at first for\r\nthree years and later for life. In addition to these official positions of\r\nmore or less established scope, Caesar received other powers not dependent\r\nupon any office. He was granted the right to appoint to both Roman and\r\nprovincial magistracies, until in 44 B. C. he had the authority to\r\nnominate half the officials annually; and in reality appointed all. In 48\r\nB. C. he received the power of making war and peace without consulting the\r\nSenate, in 46 the right of expressing his opinion first in the Senate\r\n(_ius primae sententiae_), and in 45 the sole right to command troops and\r\nto control the public moneys. In the next year ratification was given in\r\nadvance to all his future arrangements, and magistrates entering upon\r\noffice were required to swear to uphold his acts. The concentration of\r\nthese powers in his person placed Caesar above the law, and reduced the\r\nholders of public offices to the position of his servants. Honors to match\r\nhis extraordinary powers were heaped upon Caesar, partly by his own\r\ndesire, partly by the servility and fulsome flattery of the Senate. He was\r\ngranted a seat with the consuls in the Senate, if he should not be consul\r\nhimself; he received the title of parent or father of his country\r\n(_parens_ or _pater patriae_); his statue was placed among those of the\r\nkings of Rome, his image in the temple of Quirinus; the month Quinctilis,\r\nin which he was born, was renamed Julius (July) in his honor; a new\r\ncollege of priests, the Julian Luperci, was created; a temple was erected\r\nto himself and the Goddess Clementia, and a priest (flamen) appointed for\r\nhis worship there; and he was authorized to build a house on the Palatine\r\nwith a pediment like a temple. Most of these honors he received after his\r\nvictory over the Pompeians in Spain in 45 B. C. However, the title\r\n_imperator_ (Emperor), which was regularly the prerogative of a general\r\nwho was entitled to a triumph and was surrendered along with his military\r\n_imperium_, was employed by Caesar continuously from 49 until after the\r\nbattle of Thapsus in 46, when he celebrated his triumph over the Gauls and\r\nhis other non-Roman enemies. He assumed it again after Munda in the\r\nfollowing year.\r\n\r\n*Caesar’s aim—monarchy.* Taking into account the powers which Caesar\r\nwielded and his lifelong tenure of certain offices there can be no doubt\r\nthat he not only had established monarchical government in Rome but also\r\naimed to make his monarchy permanent. And this gives the explanation why\r\nhe accepted honors which were more suited to a god than to a man, for\r\nsince the time of Alexander the Great deification had been accepted in the\r\nGreek East as the legal and moral basis for the exercise of absolute\r\npower, and as distinguishing a legitimate autocracy from a tyranny. To a\r\npolytheistic age, familiar with the idea of the deification of “heroes”\r\nafter death and permeated in its educated circles with the teaching of\r\nEuhemerus that the gods were but men who in their sojourn upon earth had\r\nbeen benefactors of the human race, the deification of a monarch in no way\r\noffended religious susceptibilities. The Romans were acquainted with\r\nmonarchies of this type in Syria and in Egypt. Indeed this was the only\r\ntype of monarchy familiar to the Romans of the first century B. C., if we\r\nexclude the Parthian and other despotisms, and it was bound to influence\r\nany form of monarchical government set up in Rome. The plebs actually\r\nhailed Caesar as “_rex_,” and at the feast of the Lupercalia in February,\r\n44 B. C., Antony publicly offered him a crown. It is possible that he\r\nwould have assumed the title if popular opinion had supported this step.\r\nAnd there may well have been some truth in the rumor that he contemplated\r\nmarriage with Cleopatra, who came to Rome in 46 B. C., for a queen would\r\nbe a fit mate for a monarch and such a step would have effected the\r\npeaceful incorporation of Egypt into the Roman Empire.\r\n\r\n*Caesar’s reforms.* Upon returning to Rome after the battle of Thapsus\r\nCaesar began a series of reforms which affected practically every side of\r\nRoman life. One of the most useful was the reform of the Roman calendar.\r\nHitherto the Romans had employed a lunar year of three hundred and\r\nfifty-five days (the calendar year beginning on March first and the civil\r\nyear, since 153 B. C., on January first) which was approximately corrected\r\nto the solar year by the addition of an intercalary month of twenty-two\r\ndays in the second, and one of twenty-three days in the fourth year, of\r\ncycles of four years. For personal or political motives the pontiffs had\r\ntrifled with the intercalation of these months until in 46 B. C. the Roman\r\nyear was completely out of touch with the solar year. With the assistance\r\nof the Greek astronomer Sosigenes, Caesar introduced the Egyptian solar\r\nyear of approximately 365¼ days, in such a way that three years of 365\r\ndays were followed by one of 366 days in which an extra day was added to\r\nFebruary after the twenty-fourth of the month. The new Julian calendar\r\nwent into effect on 1 January, 45 B. C. Another abuse was partially\r\nrectified by the reduction of the number who were entitled to receive\r\ncheap grain in Rome from about 320,000 to 150,000. The Roman plebeian\r\ncolleges and guilds, which had become political clubs and had contributed\r\nto the recent disorders in the city, were dissolved with the exception of\r\nthe ancient association of craftsmen. The _tribuni aerarii_ were removed\r\nfrom the jury courts and the penalties for criminal offences increased.\r\nPlans were laid for a codification of the Roman law but this was not\r\ncarried into effect. Municipal administration in Rome and the Italian\r\ntowns was regulated by the Julian Municipal Law, which brought uniformity\r\ninto the municipal organization of Italy. The Roman magistracies were\r\nincreased in number; the quaestorships from twenty to forty, and the eight\r\npraetorships finally to sixteen. At the same time the priesthoods were\r\nlikewise enlarged. Administrative needs and the wish to reward a greater\r\nnumber of followers probably influenced these changes. A number of new\r\npatrician families were created to take the places of those which had died\r\nout. The membership of the Senate was increased to 900, and many new men,\r\nincluding ex-soldiers of Caesar and enfranchised Gauls, were enrolled in\r\nit. Caesar provided for his veterans by settling them in Italian\r\nmunicipalities and in colonies in the provinces. The deserted sites of\r\nCarthage and Corinth were repeopled with Roman colonists and once more\r\nbecame flourishing cities. In this way Caesar promoted the romanization of\r\nthe provinces, a policy which he had begun with his conferment of the\r\nfranchise upon the Transpadane Gauls in 49, and continued in the case of\r\nmany Spanish communities. This romanization of the provinces and the\r\nadmission of provincials to the Senate points to an imperial policy which\r\nwould end the exploitation of the provinces in the interests of a\r\ngoverning caste and a city mob.\r\n\r\n*Munda, 45 B. C.* Caesar proved himself a magnanimous conqueror. No Sullan\r\nproscriptions disgraced his victory. After Pharsalus he permitted all the\r\nrepublican leaders who submitted (among them Cicero), to return to Rome.\r\nEven after Thapsus at the intercession of his friends he pardoned bitter\r\nfoes like Marcus Marcellus, one of the consuls of 50 B. C. But there\r\nremained some irreconcilables led by his old lieutenant Labienus, Varus,\r\nand Gnaeus and Sextus Pompey, sons of Pompey the Great, who after\r\nPharsalus had betaken themselves with a small naval force to the western\r\nMediterranean. In 46 B. C. they were joined by Labienus and Varus and\r\nlanded in Spain where they rallied to their cause the old Pompeian\r\nsoldiers who had entered Caesar’s service but whose sympathies had been\r\nalienated by one of his _legati_, Quintus Cassius. The Caesarian\r\ncommanders could make no headway against them and it became necessary for\r\nthe dictator to take the field in person. In December 46 B. C. he set out\r\nfor Spain. Throughout the winter he sought in vain to force the enemy to\r\nbattle, but in March 45 the two armies met at Munda, where Caesar’s eight\r\ndefeated the thirteen Pompeian legions. The Caesarians gave no quarter and\r\nthe Pompeian forces were annihilated; Labienus and Varus fell on the\r\nfield, Gnaeus Pompey was later taken and put to death, but his brother\r\nSextus escaped. Caesar returned to Italy in September, 45 B. C., and\r\ncelebrated a triumph for his success.\r\n\r\n*The **assassination** of Julius Caesar, 15 March, 44 B. C.* His victory\r\nat Munda had strengthened Caesar’s autocratic position, and was\r\nresponsible for the granting of most of the exceptional honors which we\r\nhave noted above. It was now clear at Rome that Caesar did not intend to\r\nrestore the republic. In the conduct of the government he allowed no\r\nfreedom of action to either Senate or Assembly, and although in general\r\nmild and forgiving he was quick to resent any attempt to slight him or\r\nquestion his authority. The realization that Caesar contemplated the\r\nestablishment of a monarchy aroused bitter animosity among certain\r\nrepresentatives of the old governing oligarchy, who chafed under the\r\nrestraints imposed upon them by his autocratic power and resented the\r\ndegradation of the Senate to the position of a mere advisory council. It\r\ncould hardly be expected that members of the Roman aristocracy with all\r\ntheir traditions of imperial government would tamely submit to being\r\nexcluded from political life except as ministers of an autocrat who was\r\nuntil lately one of themselves. This attitude was shared by many who had\r\nhitherto been active in Caesar’s cause, as well as by republicans who had\r\nmade their peace with him. And so among these disgruntled elements a\r\nconspiracy was formed against the dictator’s life. The originator of the\r\nplot was the ex-Pompeian Caius Cassius, whom Caesar had made praetor for\r\n44, and who won over to his design Marcus Junius Brutus, a member of the\r\nhouse descended from the Brutus who was reputed to have delivered Rome\r\nfrom the tyranny of the Tarquins. Brutus had gone over to Caesar after the\r\nbattle of Pharsalus and was highly esteemed by him, but allowed himself to\r\nbe persuaded that it was his duty to imitate his ancestor’s conduct. Other\r\nconspirators of note were the Caesarians Gaius Trebonius and Decimus\r\nJunius Brutus. In all some sixty senators shared in the conspiracy. They\r\nset the Ides of March, 44, as the date for the execution of the plot.\r\nCaesar was now busily engaged with preparations for a war against the\r\nParthians, who had been a menace to Syria ever since the defeat of\r\nCrassus. This defeat Caesar aimed to avenge and, in addition, to\r\ndefinitely secure the eastern frontier of the empire. An army of sixteen\r\nlegions and 10,000 cavalry was being assembled in Greece for this\r\ncampaign, and Caesar was about to leave Rome to assume command. He is said\r\nto have been informed that a conspiracy against his life was on foot, but\r\nto have disregarded the warning. He had dismissed his body-guard of\r\nsoldiers and refused one of senators and equestrians. On the fatal day he\r\nentered the Senate chamber, where the question of granting him the title\r\nof king in the provinces was to be discussed. A group of the conspirators\r\nsurrounded him, and, drawing concealed daggers, stabbed him to death. He\r\nfell at the foot of Pompey’s statue.\r\n\r\n*Estimate of Caesar’s career.* By the Roman writers who preserved the\r\nrepublican tradition Brutus, Cassius, and their associates were honored as\r\ntyrannicides who in the name of liberty had sought to save the republic.\r\nCato, who had died rather than witness the triumph of Caesar, became their\r\nhero. But this is an extremely narrow and partizan view. The republic\r\nwhich Caesar had overthrown was no system of popular government but one\r\nwhereby a small group of Roman nobles and capitalists exploited for their\r\nown personal ends and for the satisfaction of an idle city mob millions of\r\nsubjects in the provinces. The republican organs of government had ceased\r\nto voice the opinion even of the whole Roman citizen body. The governing\r\ncircles had proven themselves incapable of bringing about any improvement\r\nin the situation and had completely lost the power of preserving peace in\r\nthe state. Radical reforms were imperative and could only be effective by\r\nvirtue of superior force. In his resort to corruption and violence in\r\nfurthering his own career and in his appeal to arms to decide the issue\r\nbetween himself and the Senate, Caesar must be judged according to the\r\npractices of his time. He was the child of his age and advanced himself by\r\nmeans which his predecessors and contemporaries employed. That he was\r\nambitious and a lover of power is undeniable but hardly a cause for\r\nreproach; and who shall blame him, if when the Senate sought to destroy\r\nhim by force, he used the same means to defend himself. His claim to\r\ngreatness lies not in his ability to outwit his rivals in the political\r\narena or outgeneral his enemies on the field of battle, but in his\r\nrealization, when the fate of the civilized world was in his hands, that\r\nthe old order was beyond remedy and in his courage in attempting to set up\r\na new order which promised to give peace and security both to Roman\r\ncitizens and to the provincials. Caesar fell before he had been able to\r\ngive stability to his organization, but the republic could not be\r\nquickened into life. After Caesar some form of monarchical government was\r\ninevitable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n\r\n                 THE PASSING OF THE REPUBLIC: 44–27 B. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         I. THE RISE OF OCTAVIAN\r\n\r\n\r\n*The political situation after Caesar’s death.* Caesar had made no\r\narrangements for a successor, and his death produced the greatest\r\nconsternation in Rome. The conspirators had made no plans to seize the\r\nreins of power, and instead of finding their act greeted with an outburst\r\nof popular approval, they were left face to face with the fact that\r\nalthough Caesar was dead the Caesarian party lived on in his veterans and\r\nthe city populace, led by the consul Mark Antony, and Marcus Aemilius\r\nLepidus, Caesar’s master of the horse. The Senate met on 17 March, and it\r\nwas evident that a majority of its members supported the assassins, but\r\nthey were afraid of the legion which Lepidus had under his orders and the\r\nCaesarian veterans in the city. Antony, who had obtained possession of\r\nCaesar’s papers and money, took the lead of the Caesarian party and came\r\nto terms with their opponents. It was agreed that the conspirators should\r\ngo unpunished, but that the acts of Caesar should be ratified, even those\r\nwhich had not yet been carried into effect, that his will should be\r\napproved, and that he should receive a public funeral.\r\n\r\nThe reading of Caesar’s will revealed that he had left his gardens on the\r\nright bank of the Tiber as a public park, had bequeathed a donation of\r\nthree hundred sesterces (about fifteen dollars) to each Roman citizen and\r\nhad adopted his grand-nephew Caius Octavius as his son and heir to\r\nthree-fourths of his fortune. By a speech delivered to the people on the\r\nday of Caesar’s funeral Antony skilfully enflamed popular sentiment\r\nagainst Caesar’s murderers. The mob seized the dictator’s corpse, burned\r\nit in the forum and buried the ashes there. The chief conspirators did not\r\ndare to remain in the city; Decimus Brutus went to his province of\r\nCisalpine Gaul, Marcus Brutus and Cassius lingered in the neighborhood of\r\nRome. Antony was master of the situation in the capital and overawed\r\nopposition by his bodyguard of 6000 veterans. He held in check Lepidus and\r\nother Caesarians who called for vengeance upon the conspirators. Lepidus\r\nwas won over by his election to the position of Pontifex Maximus to\r\nsucceed Caesar and was induced to leave the city for his province of\r\nHither Spain to check the progress of Sextus Pompey, who had reappeared in\r\nFarther Spain and defeated the Caesarian governor. It was hoped that\r\nSextus would be satisfied with permission to return to Rome and\r\ncompensation for his father’s property. Caesar’s arrangements for the\r\nprovincial governorships had assigned Macedonia to Antony and Syria to\r\nDolabella, who became Antony’s colleague in the consulate at Caesar’s\r\ndeath. This assignment Antony altered by a law which granted him Cisalpine\r\nGaul and the Transalpine district outside the Narbonese province for a\r\nterm of six years in violation of a law of Caesar’s, which limited\r\nproconsular commands to two years. Dolabella was to have Syria for a like\r\nperiod and Decimus Brutus was given Macedonia in exchange for Cisalpine\r\nGaul. The consuls were to occupy their provinces at once. To Brutus and\r\nCassius were assigned for the next year the provinces of Crete and Cyrene;\r\nwhile for the present they were given a special commission to collect\r\ngrain in Sicily and Asia. The two left Italy for the East with the\r\nintention of seizing the provinces there before the arrival of Dolabella.\r\nThey hoped to raise a force which would enable them to check Antony’s\r\ncareer, for it was evident that Antony regarded himself as Caesar’s\r\npolitical heir and was planning to follow the latter’s path to absolute\r\npower.\r\n\r\n*Caius Octavius.* But he found an unexpected rival in the person of\r\nCaesar’s adopted son, Caius Octavius, a youth of eighteen years, who at\r\nthe time of Caesar’s death was at Apollonia in Illyricum with the army\r\nthat was being assembled for the Parthian War. Against the advice of his\r\nparents he returned to Rome and claimed his inheritance. His presence was\r\nunwelcome to Antony, who had expended Caesar’s money, and refused to\r\nrefund it. Thereupon Octavius raised funds by selling his own properties\r\nand borrowing, and began to pay off the legacies of Caesar. By this means\r\nhe soon acquired popularity with the Caesarians. The formalities of his\r\nadoption were not completed until the following year, but from this time\r\non he took the name of Caesar.(13)\r\n\r\nAntony underestimated the capacities of this rather sickly youth and\r\ncontinued to refuse him recognition, but was soon made aware of his\r\nmistake. He himself was anxious to occupy his province of Cisalpine Gaul,\r\nand since Decimus Brutus refused to evacuate it, Antony determined to\r\ndrive him out and obtained permission to recall for that purpose the four\r\nlegions from Macedonia. Before their arrival Octavian raised a force among\r\nCaesar’s veterans in Campania, and on the march from Brundisium to Rome\r\ntwo of the four Macedonian legions deserted to him. The Caesarians were\r\nnow divided into two parties, and Octavian began to coöperate with the\r\nrepublicans in the Senate. The latter were thus encouraged to oppose\r\nAntony with whom reconciliation was impossible. Cicero, who had not been\r\namong the conspirators but who had subsequently approved Caesar’s murder,\r\nwas about to leave Italy to join Brutus when he heard of the changed\r\nsituation in Rome and returned to assume the leadership of the republican\r\nparty. Antony left Rome for the Cisalpine province early in December, 44\r\nB. C., and Cicero induced the Senate to enter into a coalition with\r\nOctavian against him. In his _Philippic Orations_ he gave full vent to his\r\nbitter hatred of Antony and so aroused the latter’s undying enmity.\r\n\r\n*The war at Mutina, December 44–April 43 B. C.* In Cisalpine Gaul Decimus\r\nBrutus, relying upon the support of the Senate, refused to yield to Antony\r\nand was blockaded in Mutina. The Senate made preparations for his relief.\r\nAntony was ordered to leave the province, and Hirtius and Pansa, who\r\nbecame consuls in January, 43, took the field against him. The aid of\r\nOctavian was indispensable and the Senate conferred upon him the\r\npropraetorian _imperium_ with consular rank in the Senate. The combined\r\narmies defeated Antony in two battles in the vicinity of Mutina, forcing\r\nhim to give up the siege and flee towards Transalpine Gaul. But Pansa died\r\nof wounds received in the first engagement and Hirtius fell in the course\r\nof the second. Ignoring Octavian, the Senate entrusted Brutus with the\r\ncommand and the task of pursuing Antony. The power of the Senate seemed\r\nreëstablished, for Marcus Brutus and Cassius had succeeded in their design\r\nof getting control of the eastern provinces, Dolabella having perished in\r\nthe conflict, and were at the head of a considerable military and naval\r\nforce. The Senate accordingly conferred upon them supreme military\r\nauthority (_maius imperium_), and gave to Sextus Pompey, then at Massalia,\r\na naval command. At last Cicero could induce the senators to declare\r\nAntony a public enemy. He no longer felt the support of Octavian a\r\nnecessity and expressed the attitude of the republicans towards him in the\r\nsaying “the young man is to be praised, to be honored, to be set\r\naside.”(14) But it was soon evident that the experienced orator had\r\nentirely misjudged this young man who, so far from being the tool of the\r\nSenate, had used that body for his own ends. Octavian refused to aid\r\nDecimus Brutus, and demanded from the Senate his own appointment as\r\nconsul, a triumph, and rewards for his troops. His demands were rejected,\r\nwhereupon he marched upon Rome with his army, and occupied the city. On 19\r\nAugust, he had himself elected consul with Quintus Pedius as his\r\ncolleague. The latter carried a bill which established a special court for\r\nthe trial of Caesar’s murderers, who were condemned and banished. The same\r\npenalty was pronounced upon Sextus Pompey. The Senate’s decree against\r\nAntony was revoked.\r\n\r\n*The Triumvirate, 43 B. C.* On his way to Transalpine Gaul Antony had met\r\nwith Lepidus, whom the Senate had summoned from Spain to the assistance of\r\nDecimus Brutus. But Lepidus was a Caesarian and, alarmed by the success of\r\nMarcus Brutus and Cassius, allowed his troops to go over to Antony.\r\nDecimus Brutus had taken up the pursuit of Antony and joined forces with\r\nPlancus, governor of Narbonese Gaul. However, upon news of the events in\r\nRome, Plancus abandoned Brutus and joined Antony. Brutus was deserted by\r\nhis troops and killed while a fugitive in Gaul.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     II. THE TRIUMVIRATE OF 43 B. C.\r\n\r\n\r\nOctavian had taken care to have the defense of Italy against Antony and\r\nLepidus entrusted to himself, and hastened northwards to meet the advance\r\nof their forces. But both sides were ready to come to terms and unite\r\ntheir forces for the purpose of crushing their common enemies, Brutus and\r\nCassius. Accordingly, at a conference of the three leaders on an island in\r\nthe river Renus near Bononia, a reconciliation between Antony and Octavian\r\nwas effected and plans laid for their coöperation in the immediate future.\r\nThe three decided to have themselves appointed triumvirs for the\r\nsettlement of the commonwealth (_triumviri reipublicae __constituendae_)\r\nfor a term of five years. They were to have consular _imperium_ with the\r\nright to appoint to the magistracies and their acts were to be valid\r\nwithout the approval of the Senate. Furthermore, they divided among\r\nthemselves the western provinces; Antony received those previously\r\nassigned to him, Lepidus took the Spains and Narbonese Gaul; while to\r\nOctavian fell Sardinia, Sicily and Africa. Octavian was to resign his\r\nconsulship, but in the next year to be joint commander with Antony in a\r\ncampaign against the republican armies in the East while Lepidus protected\r\ntheir interests in Rome. The triumvirate was legalized by a tribunician\r\nlaw (the _lex Titia_) of 27 November, 43, and its members formally entered\r\nupon office on the first of January following. Unlike the secret coalition\r\nof Pompey, Crassus and Caesar, the present one constituted a commission\r\nclothed with almost supreme public powers.\r\n\r\n*Proscriptions.* The formation of the coalition was followed by the\r\nproscription of the enemies of the triumvirs, partly for the sake of\r\nvengeance but largely to secure money for their troops from the\r\nconfiscation of the properties of the proscribed. Among the chief victims\r\nwas Cicero, whose death Antony demanded. He died with courage for the sake\r\nof the republican ideal to which he was devoted, but it must be recognized\r\nthat this devotion was to the cause of a corrupt aristocracy, whose crimes\r\nhe refused to share, although he forced himself to condone and justify\r\nthem. The exactions of the triumvirs did not end with the confiscation of\r\nthe goods of the proscribed; special taxes were laid upon the propertied\r\nclasses in Italy and eighteen of the most flourishing Italian\r\nmunicipalities were marked out as sites for colonies of veterans.\r\n\r\n*Divus Julius.* In 42 B. C. Octavian dedicated a temple to Julius Caesar\r\nin the forum where his body had been burned. Later by a special law Caesar\r\nwas elevated among the gods of the Roman state with the name of Divus\r\nJulius. Meanwhile Octavian had found difficulty in occupying his allotted\r\nprovinces. Africa was eventually conquered by one of his lieutenants, but\r\nSextus Pompey, who controlled the sea, had occupied Sardinia and Sicily.\r\nHis forces were augmented by many of the proscribed and by adventurers of\r\nall sorts, and Octavian could not dislodge him before setting out against\r\nBrutus and Cassius.\r\n\r\n*Philippi, 42 B. C.* These republican generals had raised an army of\r\n80,000 troops, in addition to allied contingents, and taken up a position\r\nin Thrace to await the attack of the triumvirs. In the summer of 42 B. C.\r\nthe latter transported their troops across the Adriatic in spite of the\r\nfleet of their enemies, and the two armies faced each other near Philippi\r\non the borders of Macedonia and Thrace. An indecisive battle was fought in\r\nwhich Antony defeated Cassius, who committed suicide in despair, but\r\nBrutus routed the troops commanded by Octavian. Shortly afterwards Brutus\r\nwas forced by his soldiers to risk another battle. This time he was\r\ncompletely defeated, and took his own life.\r\n\r\n*The division of the Empire.* The triumvirs now redistributed the\r\nprovinces among themselves, Cisalpine Gaul was incorporated in Italy,\r\nwhose political boundaries at length coincided with its geographical\r\nfrontier. The whole of Transalpine Gaul was given to Antony, Octavian\r\nreceived the two Spains, while Lepidus was forced to content himself with\r\nAfrica. He was suspected by his colleagues of having intrigued with Sextus\r\nPompey, and they were now in a position to weaken him at the risk of his\r\nopen hostility. From the time of the meeting near Bononia Antony had been\r\nthe chief personage in the coalition and his prestige was enhanced by his\r\nsuccess at Philippi. It was now agreed that he should settle conditions in\r\nthe eastern provinces and raise funds there, while Octavian should return\r\nto Italy and carry out the promised assignment of lands to their troops.\r\nThis decision was of momentous consequence for the future. In the summer\r\nof 41 B. C. Antony received a visit from Cleopatra at Tarsus in Cilicia.\r\nHer personal charms and keen intelligence, which had enthralled the great\r\nJulius, exercised an even greater fascination over Antony, whose cardinal\r\nweaknesses were indolence and sensual indulgence. He followed Cleopatra to\r\nEgypt, where he remained until 40 B. C.\r\n\r\n*Octavian in Italy, 42–40 B. C.* In Italy Octavian was confronted with the\r\ntask of providing lands for some 170,000 veterans. The eighteen\r\nmunicipalities previously selected for this purpose proved insufficient,\r\nand a general confiscation of small holdings took place, whereby many\r\npersons were rendered homeless and destitute. Few, like the poet Virgil,\r\nfound compensation through the influence of a powerful patron. A heavy\r\nblow was dealt to the prosperity of Italy. The task of Octavian was\r\ngreatly hampered by opposition from the friends of Antony, led by the\r\nlatter’s wife Fulvia and his brother Lucius Antonius. Hostilities broke\r\nout in which Lucius was besieged in Perusia and starved into submission\r\n(40 B. C.). Fulvia went to join Antony, while others of their faction fled\r\nto Sextus Pompey who still held Sicily. Of great importance to Octavian\r\nwas his acquisition of Gaul which came into his hands through the death of\r\nAntony’s legate, Calenus. An indication of the approaching break between\r\nOctavian and Antony was the former’s divorce of his wife Clodia, and his\r\nmarriage with Scribonia, a relative of Sextus Pompey, whom he hoped to win\r\nover to his side.\r\n\r\n*Treaty of Brundisium, 40 B. C.* While Octavian had been involved in the\r\nPerusian war, the Parthians had overrun the province of Syria, and in\r\nconjunction with them Quintus Labienus, a follower of Brutus and Cassius,\r\npenetrated Asia Minor as far as the Aegean coast. Antony thereupon\r\nreturned to Italy to gather troops to reëstablish Roman authority in the\r\nEast. Both he and Octavian were prepared for war and hostilities began\r\naround Brundisium, which refused Antony admittance. However, a\r\nreconciliation was effected, and an agreement entered into which was known\r\nas the treaty of Brundisium. It was provided that Octavian should have\r\nSpain, Gaul, Sardinia, Sicily and Dalmatia, while Antony should hold the\r\nRoman possessions east of the Ionian sea; Lepidus retained Africa, and\r\nItaly was to be held in common. To cement the alliance Antony, whose wife\r\nFulvia had died, married Octavia, sister of Octavian.\r\n\r\n*The treaty of Misenum, 39 B. C.* In the following year Antony and\r\nOctavian were forced to come to terms with Sextus Pompey. He still\r\ndefiantly held Sicily and in addition wrested Sardinia from Octavian. His\r\ncommand of these islands and of the seas about Italy enabled him to cut\r\noff the grain supply of Rome, where a famine broke out. This brought about\r\na meeting of the three at Misenum in which it was agreed that Sextus\r\nshould govern Sardinia, Sicily and Achaia for five years, should be consul\r\nand augur, and receive a monetary compensation for his father’s property\r\nin Rome. In return he engaged to secure peace at sea and convoy the grain\r\nsupply for the city. However, the terms of the treaty were never fully\r\ncarried out and in the next year Octavian and Sextus were again at war.\r\nThe former regained possession of Sardinia but failed in an attack upon\r\nSicily.\r\n\r\n*Treaty of Tarentum, 37 B. C.* Meanwhile Antony had returned to the East\r\nwhere in the years 39–37 B. C. his lieutenants won back the Asiatic\r\nprovinces from Labienus and the Parthians and drove the latter beyond the\r\nEuphrates. He now resolved to carry out the plan of Julius Caesar for the\r\nconquest of the Parthian kingdom. This necessitated his return to Italy to\r\nsecure reinforcements. But, his landing was opposed by Octavian who was\r\nangry because Antony had not supported him against Sextus Pompey, whom\r\nAntony evidently regarded as a useful check upon his colleague’s power.\r\nHowever, Octavia managed to reconcile her brother and her husband, and the\r\ntwo reached a new agreement at Tarentum. Here it was arranged that Antony\r\nshould supply Octavian with one hundred ships for operations against\r\nPompey, that Lepidus should coöperate in the attack upon Sicily, and that\r\nboth he and Octavian should furnish Antony with soldiers for the Parthian\r\nwar. As the power of the triumvirs had legally lapsed on 31 December, 38\r\nB. C., they decided to have themselves reappointed for another five years,\r\nwhich would terminate at the close of 33 B. C. This appointment like the\r\nfirst was carried into effect by a special law.\r\n\r\n*The defeat of Sextus Pompey, 36 B. C.* Octavian now energetically pressed\r\nhis attack upon Sicily, while Lepidus coöperated by besieging Lilybaeum.\r\nAt length, in September, 36 B. C., Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, Octavian’s\r\nablest general, destroyed the bulk of Pompey’s fleet in a battle off\r\nNaulochus. Pompey fled to Asia, where two years later he was captured by\r\nAntony’s forces and executed. After the flight of Sextus, Lepidus\r\nchallenged Octavian’s claim to Sicily, but his troops deserted him for\r\nOctavian and he was forced to throw himself upon the latter’s mercy.\r\nStripped of his power and retaining only his office of chief pontiff, he\r\nlived under guard in an Italian municipality until his death in 12 B. C.\r\nHis provinces were taken by Octavian. The defeat of Sextus Pompey and the\r\ndeposition of Lepidus gave Octavian sole power over the western half of\r\nthe empire, and inevitably tended to sharpen the rivalry and antagonism\r\nwhich had long existed between himself and Antony. In the same year\r\nOctavian was granted the tribunician sacrosanctity and the right to sit on\r\nthe tribune’s bench in the Senate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          III. THE VICTORY OF OCTAVIAN OVER ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA\r\n\r\n\r\n*The Parthian war, 36 B. C.* After the Treaty of Tarentum Antony proceeded\r\nto Syria to begin preparations for his campaign against the Parthians\r\nwhich he began in 36 B. C. Avoiding the Mesopotamian desert, he marched to\r\nthe north through Armenia into Media Atropatene in the hope of surprising\r\nthe enemy. However, having met with a repulse in his siege of the fortress\r\nPhraata (or Praaspa), he was forced to retreat. He was vigorously pursued\r\nby the Parthians, but by skilful generalship managed to conduct the bulk\r\nof his army back to Armenia. Still he lost over 20,000 of his troops, and\r\nhis reputation suffered severely from the complete failure of the\r\nundertaking. And so he prepared once more to take the offensive. As he\r\nattributed the failure of the late expedition to the disloyalty of the\r\nking of Armenia, Antony marched against him, treacherously took him\r\nprisoner and occupied his kingdom (34 B. C.). Thereupon he entered into an\r\nalliance with the king of Media Atropatene, a vassal of Parthia, and\r\nformed ambitious projects for the conquest of the eastern provinces of the\r\nempires of Alexander the great and the Seleucids. But these plans could\r\nonly be executed with the help of the military resources of Italy and the\r\nwestern provinces that were now completely in the hands of Octavian. In\r\nview of the jealousy existing between the two triumvirs it was not likely\r\nthat Octavian would willingly provide Antony with the means to increase\r\nhis power, and so the latter was prepared to resort to force to make good\r\nhis claim upon Italy.\r\n\r\n*Antony and Cleopatra.* Another factor in the quarrel was Antony’s\r\nconnection with Cleopatra. While in Antioch in 36 B. C. he openly married\r\nCleopatra, and in the next year refused his legal wife, Octavia,\r\npermission to join him. This was equivalent to publicly renouncing his\r\nfriendship with Octavian. Although it cannot be said that Antony had\r\nbecome a mere tool of Cleopatra, he was completely won over to her plans\r\nfor the future of Egypt; namely, that since Egypt must sooner or later be\r\nincorporated in the Roman empire, this should be brought about by her\r\nunion with the ruler of the Romans. Consequently, since her marriage with\r\nAntony she actively supported his ambition to be the successor of Julius\r\nCaesar. Their aims were clearly revealed by a pageant staged in Alexandria\r\nin 34 B. C., in which Antony and Cleopatra appeared as the god Dionysus\r\nand the goddess Isis, seated on golden thrones. In an address to the\r\nassembled public Antony proclaimed Cleopatra “queen of queens,” and ruler\r\nof Egypt, Cyprus, Crete and Coele-Syria; joint ruler with her was Ptolemy\r\nCaesarion, the son she had borne to Caesar. The two young sons of Antony\r\nand Cleopatra were proclaimed “kings of kings”; the elder as king of\r\nArmenia, Media and the Parthians, the younger as king of Syria, Phoenicia\r\nand Cilicia. To their daughter, Cleopatra, was assigned Cyrene. These\r\narrangements aroused great mistrust and hostility towards Antony among the\r\nRomans, who resented the partition of Rome’s eastern provinces in the\r\ninterest of oriental potentates. Relying upon this sentiment, Octavian in\r\n33 B. C. refused Antony’s demands for troops and joint authority in Italy.\r\nAntony at once postponed the resumption of the Parthian war and prepared\r\nto march against his rival.\r\n\r\n*The outbreak of hostilities, 32 B. C.* The final break came early in 32\r\nB. C. The triumvirate legally terminated with the close of 33 B. C. and\r\ntwo consuls of Antony’s faction came into office for the following year.\r\nTo win support in Rome, Antony wrote to the Senate offering to surrender\r\nhis powers as triumvir and restore the old constitution. His friends\r\nintroduced a proposal that Octavian should surrender his _imperium_ at\r\nonce, but this was vetoed by a tribune. Octavian then took charge of\r\naffairs in Rome, and the consuls, not daring to oppose him, fled to\r\nAntony, accompanied by many senators of his party. Thereupon Octavian\r\ncaused the Assembly to abrogate the former’s _imperium_ and also his\r\nappointment to the consulship for 31 B. C. To justify his actions and\r\nconvince the Italians of the danger which threatened them from the\r\nalliance of Antony and Cleopatra, Octavian seized and published Antony’s\r\nwill which had been deposited in the temple of Vesta. The will confirmed\r\nthe disposition which he had made of the eastern provinces in the interest\r\nof the house of Cleopatra. Octavian was now able to bring about a\r\ndeclaration of war against the Egyptian queen and to exact an oath of\r\nloyalty to himself from the senators in Rome and from the municipalities\r\nof Italy and the western provinces. It was this oath of allegiance which\r\nwas the main basis of his authority for the next few years. In reply to\r\nthese measures, Antony formally divorced Octavia and refused to recognize\r\nthe validity of the laws which deprived him of his powers.\r\n\r\n*Actium, 31 B. C.* In the fall of 33 B. C. Antony and Cleopatra began\r\nassembling their forces in Greece with the intention of invading Italy. By\r\nthe next year they had brought together an army of about 100,000 men,\r\nsupported by a fleet of 500 ships of war. However, no favorable occasion\r\nfor attempting a landing in Italy presented itself and both the fleet and\r\nthe army went into winter quarters in the gulf of Ambracia (32–1 B. C.).\r\nIn the spring of 31 B. C. Octavian with 80,000 men and 400 warships\r\ncrossed over to Epirus and took up a position facing his opponents who had\r\ntaken their station in the bay of Actium at the entrance to the gulf of\r\nAmbracia. His most capable general was Agrippa. Owing to discord which had\r\narisen between Cleopatra and his Roman officers, Antony remained inactive\r\nwhile detachments of Octavian’s forces won over important points in\r\nGreece. Antony began to suffer from a shortage of supplies and some of his\r\ninfluential followers deserted to the opposite camp. At length he risked a\r\nnaval battle, in the course of which Cleopatra and the Egyptian squadron\r\nset sail for Egypt and Antony followed her. His fleet was defeated and his\r\narmy, which attempted to retreat to Macedonia, was forced to surrender.\r\nThere is little doubt that Cleopatra had for some time been contemplating\r\ntreachery to Antony, and her desertion was probably based on the\r\ncalculation that if Octavian should prove victorious she would be able to\r\nclaim credit for her services, while if Antony should be the victor, she\r\nwas confident of obtaining pardon for her conduct. Probably she did not\r\nanticipate that Antony would join her in flight. At any rate, when Antony\r\nabandoned his still undefeated fleet and army he sealed both his fate and\r\nhers. The victor advanced slowly eastwards and in the summer of 30 B. C.\r\nbegan his invasion of Egypt. Antony’s attempts at defense were unavailing;\r\nhis troops went over to Octavian who occupied Alexandria. In despair he\r\ncommitted suicide. For a time Cleopatra, who had frustrated Antony’s last\r\nattempt at resistance, hoped to win over Octavian as she had won Caesar\r\nand Antony, so that she might save at least Egypt for her dynasty. But\r\nfinding her efforts unavailing, she poisoned herself rather than grace\r\nOctavian’s triumph. The kingdom of Egypt was added to the Roman empire,\r\nnot as a province but as part of an estate to be directly administered by\r\nthe ruler of the Roman world who took his place as the heir of the\r\nPharaohs and the Ptolemies. The treasures of Egypt reimbursed Octavian for\r\nthe expenses of his late campaigns. After reëstablishing the old provinces\r\nand client kingdoms in the East, Octavian returned to Rome in 29 B. C.,\r\nwhere he celebrated a three-day triumph over the non-Roman peoples of\r\nEurope, Asia and Africa, whom he or his generals had subjugated during his\r\ntriumvirate.\r\n\r\nAt the age of thirty-three Octavian had made good his claim to the\r\npolitical inheritance of Julius Caesar. His victory over Antony closed the\r\ncentury of civil strife which had begun with the tribunate of Tiberius\r\nGracchus. War and the proscriptions had exacted a heavy toll from Romans\r\nand Italians; Greece, Macedonia and Asia had been brought to the verge of\r\nruin; the whole empire longed for peace. Everywhere was Octavian hailed as\r\nthe savior of the world and, as the founder of a new golden age, men were\r\nready to worship him as a god.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  IV. SOCIETY AND INTELLECTUAL LIFE IN THE LAST CENTURY OF THE REPUBLIC\r\n\r\n\r\n*The upper classes.* The characteristics of Roman society in the last\r\ncentury of the republic are the same which we have previously seen\r\ndeveloping as a result of Rome’s imperial expansion. The upper classes of\r\nsociety comprise the senatorial nobility and the equestrians; the former\r\nfinding their goal in public office, the latter in banking and financial\r\nventures, and both alike callously exploiting the subjects of Rome in\r\ntheir own interests. Of this one example will suffice. Marcus Brutus, the\r\nconspirator, who enjoyed a high repute for his honorable character, loaned\r\nmoney to the cities of Cyprus at the exorbitant rate of 48% and influenced\r\nthe senate to declare the contract valid. He did not hesitate to secure\r\nfor his agents military authority with which to enforce payment, and was\r\nmuch disappointed when Cicero, as governor of Cilicia and Cyprus, refused\r\nto give his representative such power or to allow him to collect more than\r\n12% interest on his debt.\r\n\r\nAs corruption characterized the public, so did extravagance and luxury the\r\nprivate life of the governing classes. The palaces of the wealthy in Rome\r\nwere supplemented by villas in the Sabine hills, in the watering places of\r\nthe Campanian coast, and other attractive points. The word villa, which\r\noriginally designated a farm house, now meant a country seat equipped with\r\nall the modern conveniences of city life.\r\n\r\nThe solidarity of the family life which had been the foundation of Roman\r\nmorality was fast disappearing. In general, wives no longer came under the\r\nauthority (_manus_) of their husbands upon marriage, and so retained\r\ncontrol of their properties acquired by inheritance or dowry through a\r\nguardian from their own families. Consequently women played an\r\nincreasingly independent and important part in the society of the day. In\r\nRome at least the age was one of a low tone in morals, and divorces were\r\nof common occurrence. At the same time social intercourse was\r\ncharacterized by a high degree of urbanity—the good manners which mark the\r\nsociety of cultured men.\r\n\r\n*The plebs.* Of the life of the plebs who thronged the high tenement\r\nhouses and narrow streets of Rome we know very little. But until the\r\nAssembly was overawed or superseded by armed forces the city populace\r\ncould not be ignored by the upper classes. Their votes must be courted by\r\nmagnificent displays at the public games, by entertainments and largesses\r\nof all kinds, and care must be taken to provide them with food to prevent\r\ntheir becoming a menace to the public peace. This latter problem was\r\nsolved as we have seen after the time of Caius Gracchus by providing them\r\nwith a monthly allowance of corn, at first at a greatly reduced price, but\r\nafter 57 B. C. gratuitously. Julius Caesar found about 320,000 persons\r\nsharing in this distribution, and reduced the number to 150,000 male\r\ncitizens. The city mob thus became to a certain degree state pensioners,\r\nand placed a heavy burden on the treasury. There can be no doubt that the\r\nranks of the urban proletariat were swelled by peasants who had lost their\r\nholdings in the course of the civil wars and the settlements of discharged\r\nsoldiers on Italian soil, but the chief increase came from the manumission\r\nof slaves, who as _liberti_ or freedmen became Roman citizens. Sulla’s\r\n10,000 Cornelii were of this number. The influx of these heterogeneous\r\nelements radically changed the character of the city populace which could\r\nno longer claim to be mainly of Roman and Italian stock but embraced\r\nrepresentatives of all races of the Mediterranean world. The population\r\nwas further augmented by the great numbers of slaves attached to the\r\nhouses of the wealthy or engaged in various industrial occupations for\r\ntheir masters or others who hired their services.\r\n\r\nIn the rural districts of Italy the plantation system had been widely\r\nextended and agriculture and grazing were in the main carried on by slave\r\nlabor. Yet the free farmers had by no means entirely disappeared and free\r\nlabor was employed even on the _latifundia_ themselves. The discharged\r\nveterans who were provided with lands attest the presence of considerable\r\nnumbers of free landholders.\r\n\r\n*Religion.* In religion this period witnessed a striking decline of\r\ninterest and faith in the public religion of the Roman state. This was in\r\npart due to the influence of Greek mythology which changed the current\r\nconceptions of the Roman divinities and to Greek philosophy with its\r\nvarying doctrines as to the nature and powers of the gods. The latter\r\nespecially affected the upper classes of society upon whom fell the duty\r\nof maintaining the public cults. From the time of the Gracchi the public\r\npriesthoods declined in importance; and in many cases they were used\r\nsolely as a tool for political purposes. The increase in the numbers of\r\nthe priestly colleges and the substitution of election for coöptation\r\nbrought in many members unversed in the ancient traditions, and the\r\nholders of the priesthoods in general showed great ignorance of their\r\nduties, especially with regard to the ordering of the state calendar. Some\r\nreligious associations like the Arval Brotherhood ceased to exist and\r\nknowledge of the character of some of the minor deities was completely\r\nlost. The patrician priesthoods, which involved serious duties and\r\nrestricted the freedom of their incumbents were avoided as much as\r\npossible. At the same time the private religious rites, hereditary within\r\nfamily groups, fell into decay. While the attitude of educated circles\r\ntowards the state cults was thus one of indifference or skepticism, it is\r\nhard to speak of that of the common people. Superstitious they were beyond\r\na doubt, but in the performance of the state cults they had never actively\r\nparticipated. The more emotional cults of the oriental type made a greater\r\nappeal to them if we may judge from the difficulty which the Senate\r\nexperienced in banishing the priests of Isis from the city.\r\n\r\n*Stoicism and Epicureanism.* The philosophic systems which made the most\r\nconverts among the educated Romans were Stoicism and Epicureanism. The\r\nformer, as we have seen, had been introduced to Rome by Panaetius, whose\r\nteaching was continued by Posidonius. It appealed to the Romans as\r\noffering a practical rule of life for men engaged in public affairs. On\r\nthe other hand, the doctrine of Epicurus that men should withdraw from the\r\nannoyances of political life and seek happiness in the pursuit of\r\npleasure, that is, intellectual pleasure, was interpreted by the Roman as\r\nsanctioning sensual indulgence and became the creed of those who gave\r\nthemselves up to a life of ease and indolence.\r\n\r\n*Literature.* The last century of the republic saw the completion of the\r\namalgamation of Greek and Roman culture which had begun in the previous\r\nepoch. The resulting Graeco-Roman culture was a bi-lingual civilization\r\nbased upon Greek intellectual and Roman political achievement which it was\r\nthe mission of the empire to spread to the barbaric peoples of the western\r\nprovinces. The age was marked by many-sided, keen, intellectual activity\r\nwhich brought Rome’s intellectual development to its height. Yet this\r\nGraeco-Roman culture was almost exclusively a possession of the higher\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\n*The drama.* In the field of dramatic literature the writing of tragedy\r\npractically ceased and comedy took the popular forms of caricature\r\n(_fabula Atellana_) and the mime, or realistic imitation of the life of\r\nthe lower classes. Both forms were derived from Greek prototypes but dealt\r\nwith subjects of everyday life and won great popularity in the theatrical\r\nexhibitions given at the public games.\r\n\r\n*Poetry: Catullus, 87–c. 54 B. C.* The best exponent of the poetry of the\r\nage is Catullus, a native of Verona in Cisalpine Gaul, who as a young man\r\nwas drawn into the vortex of fashionable society at the capital. This new\r\npoetry appealed to a highly educated class, conversant alike with the\r\nliterature of the Greek classic and Hellenistic periods as well as with\r\nmodern production, and able to appreciate the most elaborate and\r\ndiversified meters. The works of Catullus show the wide range of form and\r\nsubject which appealed to contemporary taste. Translations and copies of\r\nGreek originals find their place alongside epigrams and lyric poems of\r\npersonal experience. It is his poetry of passion, of love and hate, which\r\nplaces him among the foremost lyric poets of all time.\r\n\r\n*Lucretius, 98–53 B. C.* An exception among the poets of his time was\r\nLucretius, who combined the spirit of a poet with that of a religious\r\nteacher. He felt a mission to free the minds of men from fear of the power\r\nof the gods and of death. To this end he wrote a didactic epic poem, _On\r\nthe Nature of Things_, in which he explained the atomic theory of\r\nDemocritus which was the foundation of the philosophical teachings of\r\nEpicurus. The essence of this doctrine was that the world and all living\r\ncreatures were produced by the fortuitous concourse of atoms falling\r\nthrough space and that death was simply the dissolution of the body into\r\nits component atomic elements. Consequently, there was no future existence\r\nto be dreaded. True poetic value is given to the work by the author’s\r\ngreat imaginative powers and his keen observation of nature and human\r\nlife. Lucretius made the Latin hexameter a fitting medium for the\r\nexpression of sustained and lofty thought.\r\n\r\n*Oratory.* It was through the study and practice of oratory that Roman\r\nprose attained its perfection between the time of the Gracchi and Julius\r\nCaesar. Political and legal orations were weapons in the party strife of\r\nthe day and were frequently polished and edited as political pamphlets.\r\nAlong with political documents of this type appeared orations that were\r\nnot written to be delivered in the forum or senate chamber but were\r\naddressed solely to a reading public. Among the great forensic orators of\r\nthe age were the two Gracchi, of whom the younger, Caius, had the\r\nreputation of being the most effective speaker that Rome ever knew. Others\r\nof note were Marcus Antonius, grandfather of the triumvir, Lucius Licinius\r\nCrassus, and Quintus Hortensius Hortalus. But it was Cicero who brought to\r\nits perfection the Roman oration in its literary form.\r\n\r\n*Cicero, 106–43 B. C.* Cicero was beyond question the intellectual leader\r\nof his day. He was above all things an orator and until past the age of\r\nfifty his literary productivity was almost entirely in that field. In his\r\nlatter years he undertook the great task of making Hellenistic philosophy\r\naccessible to the Roman world through the medium of Latin prose. In\r\naddition to his speeches and oratorical and philosophic treatises Cicero\r\nleft to posterity a great collection of letters which were collected and\r\npublished after his death by his freedman secretary. His correspondence\r\nwith his friends is a mine of information for the student of society and\r\npolitics in the last century of the republic.\r\n\r\n*Caesar, 100–44 B. C.* Julius Caesar made his genius felt in the world of\r\nletters as well as of politics. Though an orator of high rank, he is\r\nbetter known as the author of his lucid commentaries on the Gallic war and\r\non the Civil war, which present the view that he desired the Roman public\r\nto take of his conflict with the senate.\r\n\r\n*Sallust, 86–36 B. C.* Foremost among historical writers of the period was\r\nCaius Sallustius Crispus, “the first scientific Roman historian.”\r\nSubsequent generations ranked him as the greatest Roman historian. His\r\nchief work, a history of the period 78–67 B. C., is almost entirely lost,\r\nbut two shorter studies on the Jugurthine war and Cataline’s conspiracy\r\nhave been preserved. In contrast to Cicero, he is the protagonist of\r\nCaesarianism.\r\n\r\n*Varro, 116–27 B. C.* Of great interest to later ages were the works of\r\nthe antiquarian and philologist, Marcus Terentius Varro, the most learned\r\nRoman of his time. His great work on Roman religious and political\r\nantiquities has been lost, but a part of his study _On the Latin Language_\r\nis still extant, as well as his three books _On Rural Conditions_. The\r\nlatter give a good picture of agricultural conditions in Italy towards the\r\nend of the republic.\r\n\r\n*Jurisprudence.* To legal literature considerable contributions were made\r\nboth in the domain of applied law and of legal theory. We have already\r\nnoticed the appeal which the Stoic philosophy made to the best that was in\r\nRoman character and many of the leading Roman jurists accepted its\r\nprinciples. It was natural then that Roman legal philosophy should begin\r\nunder the influence of the Stoic doctrine of a universal divine law ruling\r\nthe world, this law being an emanation of right reason, i. e. the divine\r\npower governing the universe. The most influential legal writers of the\r\nperiod were Quintus Mucius Scaevola who compiled a systematic treatment of\r\nthe civil law in eighteen books, and Servius Sulpicius Rufus, the\r\ncontemporary of Cicero. Sulpicius was a most productive author, whose\r\nworks included _Commentaries_ on the XII Tables, and on the Praetor’s\r\nEdict, as well as studies on special aspects of Roman law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 PART III\r\n\r\n\r\n            THE PRINCIPATE OR EARLY EMPIRE: 27 B. C.–285 A. D.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: The Roman Empire from 31 B. C. to 300 A. D.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n\r\n          THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE PRINCIPATE: 27 B. C.–14 A. D.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             I. THE PRINCEPS\r\n\r\n\r\n*The settlement of 27 B. C.* During his sixth and seventh consulships, in\r\nthe years 28 and 27 B. C., Octavian surrendered the extraordinary powers\r\nwhich he had exercised during the war against Antony and Cleopatra and, as\r\nhe later expressed it, placed the commonwealth at the disposal of the\r\nSenate and the Roman people. But this step did not imply that the old\r\nmachinery of government was to be restored without modifications and\r\nrestrictions or that Octavian intended to abdicate his position as arbiter\r\nof the fate of the Roman world. Nor would he have been justified in so\r\ndoing, for such a course of action would have led to a repetition of the\r\nanarchy which followed the retirement and death of Sulla, and, in\r\ndisposing of his rivals, Octavian had assumed the obligation of giving to\r\nthe Roman world a stable form of government. Public sentiment demanded a\r\nstrong administration, even if this could only be attained at the expense\r\nof the old republican institutions.\r\n\r\nBut while ambition and duty alike forbade him to relinquish his hold upon\r\nthe helm of state, Octavian shrank from realizing the ideal of Julius\r\nCaesar and establishing a monarchical form of government. From this he was\r\ndeterred both by the fate of his adoptive father and his own cautious,\r\nconservative character which gave him such a shrewd understanding of Roman\r\ntemperament. His solution of the problem was to retain the old Roman\r\nconstitution as far as was practicable, while securing for himself such\r\npowers as would enable him to uphold the constitution and prevent a\r\nrenewal of the disorders of the preceding century. What powers were\r\nnecessary to this end, Octavian determined on the basis of practical\r\nexperience between 27 and 18 B. C. And so his restoration of the\r\ncommonwealth signified the end of a régime of force and paved the way for\r\nhis reception of new authority legally conferred upon him.\r\n\r\n*The imperium.* Nothing had contributed more directly to the failure of\r\nthe republican form of government than the growth of the professional army\r\nand the inability of the Senate to control its commanders. Therefore, it\r\nwas absolutely necessary for the guardian of peace and of the constitution\r\nto concentrate the supreme military authority in his own hands.\r\nConsequently on 13 January, 27 B. C., the birthday of the new order,\r\nOctavian, by vote of the Assembly and Senate, received for a period of ten\r\nyears the command and administration of the provinces of Hither Spain,\r\nGaul and Syria, that is, the chief provinces in which peace was not yet\r\nfirmly established and which consequently required the presence of the\r\nbulk of the Roman armies. Egypt, over which he had ruled as the successor\r\nof the Ptolemies since 30 B. C., remained directly subject to his\r\nauthority. As long as he continued to hold the consulship, the _imperium_\r\nof Octavian was senior (_maius_) to that of the governors of the other\r\nprovinces which remained under the control of the Senate. In effect, his\r\nsolution of the military problem was to have conferred upon himself an\r\nextraordinary command which found its precedents in those of Lucullus,\r\nPompey and Caesar, but which was of such scope and duration that it made\r\nhim the commander-in-chief of the forces of the empire.\r\n\r\n*The titles Augustus and Imperator.* On 16 January of the same year the\r\nSenate conferred upon Octavian the title of Augustus (Greek, _Sebastos_)\r\nby which he was henceforth regularly designated. It was a term which\r\nimplied no definite powers, but, being an epithet equally applicable to\r\ngods or men, was well adapted to express the exalted position of its\r\nbearer. A second title was that of Imperator. Following the republican\r\ncustom, this had been conferred upon Augustus by his army and the Senate\r\nafter his victory at Mutina in 43 B. C., and in imitation of Julius Caesar\r\nhe converted this temporary title of honor into a permanent one. Finally,\r\nin 38 B. C., he placed it first among his personal names (as a\r\n_praenomen_). After 27 B. C. Augustus made a two-fold use of the term; as\r\na permanent _praenomen_, and as a title of honor assumed upon the occasion\r\nof victories won by his officers. From this time the _praenomen_ Imperator\r\nwas a prerogative of the Roman commander-in-chief. However, during his\r\nprincipate Augustus did not stress its use, since he did not wish to\r\nemphasize the military basis of his power. But in the Greek-speaking\r\nprovinces, where his power rested exclusively upon his military authority,\r\nthe title Imperator was seized upon as the expression of his unlimited\r\n_imperium_ and was translated in that sense by _autocrator_. From the\r\n_praenomen_ imperator is derived the term emperor, commonly used in modern\r\ntimes to designate Augustus and his successors.\r\n\r\n*The tribunicia potestas, 23 B. C.* From 27 to 23 B. C. the authority of\r\nAugustus rested upon his annual tenure of the consulship and his\r\nprovincial command. But in the summer of 23 B. C. he resigned the\r\nconsulship and received from the Senate and people the tribunician\r\nauthority (_tribunicia potestas_) for life. As early as 36 B. C. he had\r\nbeen granted the personal inviolability of the tribunes, and in 30 B. C.\r\ntheir right of giving aid (_auxilium_). To these privileges there must now\r\nhave been added the right of intercession and of summoning the _comitia_\r\n(_jus agendi cum populo_).(15) In this way Augustus acquired a control\r\nover comitial and senatorial legislation and openly assumed the position\r\nof protector of the interests of the city plebs. He was moreover amply\r\ncompensated for the loss of civil power which his resignation of the\r\nconsulship involved, and at the same time he got rid of an office which\r\nmust be shared with a colleague of equal rank and the perpetual tenure of\r\nwhich was a violation of constitutional tradition. The tribunician\r\nauthority was regarded as being held for successive annual periods, which\r\nAugustus reckoned from 23 B. C.\r\n\r\n*Special powers and honors.* At the time of the conferment of the\r\ntribunician authority, a series of senatorial decrees added or gave\r\ngreater precision to the powers of Augustus. He received the right to\r\nintroduce the first topic for consideration at each meeting of the Senate,\r\nhis military _imperium_ was made valid within the _pomerium_, but, in view\r\nof his resignation of the consulship, became proconsular in the provinces.\r\nIt was probably in 23 B. C. also that Augustus received the unrestricted\r\nright of making war or peace, upon the occasion of the coming of an\r\nembassy from the king of the Parthians. In the next year he was granted\r\nthe right to call meetings of the Senate. Three years later he was\r\naccorded the consular insignia, with twelve lictors, and the privilege of\r\ntaking his seat on a curule chair between the consuls in office. These\r\nmarks of honor gave him upon official occasions the precedence among the\r\nmagistrates which his authority warranted. On the other hand, in 22 B. C.\r\nAugustus refused the dictatorship or the perpetual consulship, which were\r\nconferred upon him at the insistence of the city populace; and in the same\r\nspirit he declined to accept a general censorship of laws and morals\r\n(_cura legum et morum_) which was proffered to him in 19 B. C.\r\n\r\n*The principate.* It was by the gradual acquisition of the above powers\r\nthat the position which Augustus was to hold in the state was finally\r\ndetermined. This position may be defined as that of a magistrate, whose\r\nprovince was a combination of various powers conferred upon him by the\r\nSenate and the Roman people, and who differed from the other magistrates\r\nof the state in the immensely wider scope of his functions and the greater\r\nlength of his official term. But these various powers were separately\r\nconferred upon him and for each he could urge constitutional precedents.\r\nIt was in this spirit of deference to constitutional traditions that\r\nAugustus did not create for himself one new office which would have given\r\nhim the same authority nor accept any position that would have clothed him\r\nwith autocratic power. Therefore, as he held no definite office, Augustus\r\nhad no definite official title. But the reception of such wide powers\r\ncaused him to surpass all other Romans in dignity; hence he came to be\r\ndesignated as the _princeps_, i. e. the first of the Roman citizens\r\n(_princeps civium Romanorum_). From this arose the term principate to\r\ndesignate the tenure of office of the princeps; a term which we now apply\r\nalso to the system of government that Augustus established for the Roman\r\nEmpire. The crowning honor of his career was received by Augustus in 2\r\nA. D., when the senate, upon the motion of one who had fought under Brutus\r\nat Philippi, conferred upon him the title of “Father of His Country”\r\n(_pater patriae_), thus marking the reconciliation between the bulk of the\r\nold aristocracy and the new régime.\r\n\r\n*Renewal of the imperium.* His _imperium_, which lapsed in 18 B. C.,\r\nAugustus caused to be reconferred upon himself for successive periods of\r\nfive or ten years, thus preserving the continuity of his power until his\r\ndeath in 14 A. D.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              II. THE SENATE, THE EQUESTRIANS AND THE PLEBS\r\n\r\n\r\n*The three orders.* The social classification of the Romans into the\r\nsenatorial, equestrian and plebeian orders passed, with sharper\r\ndefinitions, from the republic into the principate. For each class a\r\ndistinct field of opportunity and public service was opened; for senators,\r\nthe magistracies and the chief military posts; for the _equites_ a new\r\ncareer in the civil and military service of the princeps, and for the\r\nplebs service as privates and subaltern officers in the professional army.\r\nHowever, these orders were by no means closed castes; the way lay open to\r\nable and successful men for advancement from the lower to the higher\r\ngrades, and for the consequent infusion of fresh vitality into the ranks\r\nof the latter.\r\n\r\n*The Senate and the senatorial order.* The senatorial order was composed\r\nof the members of the Senate and their families. Its distinctive emblem\r\nwas the broad purple stripe worn on the toga. Sons of senators assumed\r\nthis badge of the order by right of birth; equestrians, by grant of the\r\nprinceps. However, of the former those who failed to qualify for the\r\nSenate were reduced to the rank of equestrians. The possession of property\r\nvalued at 1,000,000 sesterces ($50,000) was made a requirement for\r\nadmission to the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe prospective senator was obliged to fill one of the minor city\r\nmagistracies known as the board of twenty (_viginti-virate_), next to\r\nserve as a legionary tribune and then, at the age of twenty-five, to\r\nbecome a candidate for the quaestorship, which gave admission to the\r\nSenate. From the quaestorship the official career of the senator led\r\nthrough the regular magistracies, the aedileship or tribunate, and the\r\npraetorship, to the consulship. As an ex-praetor and ex-consul a senator\r\nmight be appointed a promagistrate to govern a senatorial province; a\r\nlegate to command a legion or administer an imperial province; or a\r\ncurator in charge of some administrative commission in Rome or Italy.\r\n\r\nDuring the republic the Senate had been the actual center of the\r\nadministration and Augustus intended that it should continue to be so for\r\nthe greater part of the empire. Through the ordinary magistrates it should\r\ngovern Rome and Italy, and through the promagistrates the senatorial\r\nprovinces. Furthermore, the state treasury, the _aerarium saturni_,\r\nsupported by the revenues from Italy and the Senate’s provinces, remained\r\nunder the authority of that body. However, to render it capable of\r\nfulfilling its task and to reëstablish its prestige, the Senate which now\r\nnumbered over one thousand had to be purged of many undesirable members\r\nwho had been admitted to its roll during the recent civil wars. Therefore,\r\nin 28 B. C., Augustus in his consular capacity supervised a revision of\r\nthe senatorial list whereby two hundred unworthy persons were excluded. On\r\nthat occasion his name was placed at the head of the new roll as the\r\n_princeps senatus_. A second recension ten years later reduced the total\r\nmembership to six hundred. A third, in 4 A. D., commenced through a\r\nspecially chosen committee of three with the object of further reducing\r\ntheir number was not carried out. The Senate was automatically recruited\r\nby the annual admission of the twenty quaestors, but in addition the\r\nprinceps enjoyed the right of appointing new members who might be entered\r\nupon the roll of the Senate among the past holders of any magistracy. In\r\nthis way many prominent equestrians were admitted to the senatorial order.\r\n\r\n*The equestrian order.* For the conduct of his share of the public\r\nadministration the princeps required a great number of assistants in his\r\npersonal employ. For his legates to command the legions or his provinces\r\nwith delegated military authority Augustus could draw upon the senators,\r\nbut both custom and the prestige of the Senate forbade their entering his\r\nservice in other capacities. On the other hand, freedmen and slaves, who\r\nmight well be employed in a clerical position, obviously could not be made\r\nthe sole civil servants of the princeps. Therefore, Augustus drew into his\r\nservice the equestrian order whose business interests and traditional\r\nconnection with the public finances seemed to mark them out as peculiarly\r\nfitted to be his agents in the financial administration of the provinces.\r\n\r\nThe equestrian order in general was open to all Roman citizens in Italy\r\nand the provinces who were eighteen years of age, of free birth and good\r\ncharacter, and possessed a census rating of 400,000 sesterces ($20,000).\r\nAdmission to the order was in the control of the princeps, and carried the\r\nright to wear a narrow purple stripe on the toga and to receive a public\r\nhorse, the possession of which qualified an equestrian for the imperial\r\ncivil and military service. With the bestowal of the public horse Augustus\r\nrevived the long neglected annual parade and inspection of the _equites_.\r\n\r\nLike the career of the senators, that of the equestrians included both\r\nmilitary and civil appointments. At the outset of his _cursus honorum_ the\r\nequestrian held several military appointments, which somewhat later came\r\nregularly to include a prefecture of a corps of auxiliary infantry, a\r\ntribunate of a legionary cohort, and a prefecture of an auxiliary cavalry\r\ncorps. Thereupon he was eligible for a procuratorship, that is, a post in\r\nthe imperial civil service, usually in connection with the administration\r\nof the finances. After filling several of these procuratorships, of which\r\nthere were a great number of varying importance, an equestrian might\r\nfinally attain one of the great prefectures, as commander of the city\r\nwatch, administrator of the corn supply of Rome, commander of the imperial\r\nguards, or governor of Egypt. At the end of his equestrian career he might\r\nbe enrolled in the senatorial order. Thus through the imperial service the\r\nequestrian order was bound closely to the princeps and from its ranks\r\nthere gradually developed a nobility thoroughly loyal to the new régime.\r\n\r\n*The Comitia and the plebs.* The _comitia_, which had so long voiced the\r\nwill of the sovereign Roman people was not abolished, although it could no\r\nlonger claim to speak in the name of the Roman citizens as a whole. It\r\nstill kept up the form of electing magistrates and enacting legislation,\r\nbut its action was largely determined by the recommendations of the\r\nprinceps and his tribunician authority.\r\n\r\nWhile the city plebs, accustomed to receive its free distributions of\r\ngrain, and to be entertained at costly public spectacles, was a heavy\r\ndrain upon the resources of the state, the vigorous third estate in the\r\nItalian municipalities supplied the subaltern officers of the legions.\r\nThese were the centurions, who were the mainstay of the discipline and\r\nefficiency of the troops, and from whose ranks many advanced to an\r\nequestrian career.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     III. THE MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT\r\n\r\n\r\n*Reorganization of the army.* Upon his return to Italy in 30 B. C.,\r\nAugustus found himself at the head of an army of about 500,000 men. Of\r\nthese he released more than 300,000 from service and settled them in\r\ncolonies or in their native municipalities upon lands which it was his\r\nboast to have purchased and not confiscated. This done, he proceeded to\r\nreorganize the military establishment. Accepting the lessons of the civil\r\nwars, he maintained a permanent, professional army, recruited as far as\r\npossible by voluntary enlistment. This army comprised two main categories\r\nof troops, the legionaries and the auxiliaries.\r\n\r\n*The legions and auxilia.* The legionaries were recruited from Roman\r\ncitizens or from provincials who received Roman citizenship upon their\r\nenlistment. Their units of organization, the legions, comprised nearly\r\n6000 men, of whom 120 were cavalry and the rest infantry. The number of\r\nlegions was at first eighteen, but was later raised to twenty-five, giving\r\na total of about 150,000 men. The auxiliaries, who took the place of the\r\ncontingents of Italian allies of earlier days, were recruited from among\r\nthe most warlike subject peoples of the empire and their numbers were\r\napproximately equal to the legionaries. They were organized in small\r\ninfantry and cavalry corps (cohorts and _alae_), each 480 or 960 strong.\r\nAt the expiration of their term of service the auxiliaries were granted\r\nthe reward of Roman citizenship.\r\n\r\n*The praetorians.* A third category of troops, which, although greatly\r\ninferior in number to the legions and auxiliaries, played an exceptionally\r\ninfluential rôle in the history of the principate, was the praetorian\r\nguard. This was the imperial bodyguard which attended Augustus in his\r\ncapacity of commander-in-chief of the Roman armies. It owed its influence\r\nto the fact that it was stationed in the vicinity of Rome while the other\r\ntroops were stationed in the provinces. Under Augustus the praetorian\r\nguard comprised nine cohorts, each 1000 strong, under the command of two\r\npraetorian prefects of equestrian rank. The praetorians were recruited\r\nexclusively from the Italian peninsula, and enjoyed a shorter term of\r\nservice and higher pay than the other corps.\r\n\r\n*Conditions of service.* It was not until 6 A. D. that the term of\r\nenlistment and the conditions of discharge were definitely fixed. From\r\nthat date service in the praetorian guard was for sixteen years, in the\r\nlegions for twenty and in the _auxilia_ for twenty-five. At their\r\ndischarge the praetorians received a bonus of 5000 denarii ($1000), while\r\nthe legionaries were given 3000 denarii ($600) in addition to an\r\nassignment of land. The discharged legionaries were regularly settled in\r\ncolonies throughout the provinces. To meet this increased expense Augustus\r\nwas obliged to establish a military treasury (the _aerarium militare_),\r\nendowed out of his private patrimony, and supported by the revenue derived\r\nfrom two newly imposed taxes, a five per cent inheritance tax (_vincesima\r\nhereditatium_) which affected all Roman citizens, and a one per cent tax\r\non all goods publicly sold (_centesima rerum venalium_).\r\n\r\n*The fleets.* For the policing of the coast of Italy and the adjacent seas\r\nAugustus created a permanent fleet with stations at Ravenna and Misenum.\r\nConforming to the comparative unimportance of the Roman naval, in contrast\r\nto their military establishment, the personnel of this fleet was recruited\r\nin large measure from imperial freedmen and slaves. Only after Augustus\r\nwere these squadrons and other similar ones in the provinces placed under\r\nequestrian prefects.\r\n\r\nThe military system of Augustus strongly emphasized and guaranteed the\r\nsupremacy of Italy and the Italians over the provincials. Both the\r\nofficers and the elite troops were drawn almost exclusively from Italy or\r\nthe latinized parts of the western provinces. In like manner the\r\nreservation of the higher grades of the civil administration, the second\r\nprop of Roman rule, for Roman senators and equestrians, as well as the\r\nexclusion of the provincial imperial cult from Italian soil, marked\r\nclearly the distinction between the conquering and the subject races of\r\nthe empire. Yet it was Augustus himself who pointed the way to the\r\nultimate romanization of the provincials by the bestowal of citizenship as\r\none of the rewards for military service and by the settlement of colonies\r\nof veterans in the provinces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 IV. THE REVIVAL OF RELIGION AND MORALITY\r\n\r\n\r\n*The ideals of Augustus.* A counterpart to the governmental reorganization\r\neffected by Augustus was his attempt to revive the old time Roman virtues\r\nwhich had fallen into contempt during the last centuries of the republic.\r\nThis moral regeneration of the Roman people he regarded as the absolutely\r\nessential basis for a new era of peace and prosperity. And the reawakening\r\nof morality was necessarily preceded by a revival of the religious rites\r\nand ceremonies that in recent times had passed into oblivion through the\r\nattraction of new cults, the growth of skepticism, or the general disorder\r\ninto which the public administration had fallen as a result of civil\r\nstrife.\r\n\r\n*The revival of public religion.* One step in this direction was the\r\nreëstablishment of the ancient priestly colleges devoted to the\r\nperformance of particular rites or the cult of particular deities. To\r\nprovide these colleges with the required number of patrician members\r\nAugustus created new patrician families. He himself was enrolled in each\r\nof these colleges and, at the death of Lepidus in 12 B. C., was elected\r\nchief pontiff, the head of the state religion. A second measure was the\r\nrepair of temples and shrines which had lapsed into decay. The temple of\r\nJupiter Capitolinus, those of Quirinus and the Magna Mater, besides\r\neighty-two other shrines of lesser fame, were repaired or restored by him.\r\nOne of his generals, Munatius Plancus, renewed the temple of Saturn in the\r\nforum. A new temple was erected by Augustus to Mars the Avenger on the\r\nforum begun by Julius Caesar, another to the deified Julius himself on the\r\nold forum, and a third on the Palatine hill to Apollo, to whom he rendered\r\nthanks for the victory at Actium.\r\n\r\n*The Lares and the Genius Augusti.* Among the divinities whose cult was\r\nthus quickened into life were the Lares, the guardian deities of the\r\ncrossways, whose worship was especially practiced by the common folk.\r\nBetween the years 12 and 7 B. C. each of the two hundred and sixty-five\r\n_vici_ into which the city of Rome was then divided was provided with a\r\nshrine dedicated to the Lares and the Genius of Augustus, that is, the\r\ndivine spirit which watched over his fortunes. This worship was conducted\r\nby a committee of masters, annually elected by the inhabitants of these\r\nquarters. In this way the city plebs while not worshipping the princeps\r\nhimself, were yet encouraged to look upon him as their protector and\r\nguardian.\r\n\r\n*The imperial cult.* A new religion which was to be symbolic of the unity\r\nof the empire and the loyalty of the provincials was the cult of Rome and\r\nAugustus, commonly known as the imperial cult. The worship of the goddess\r\nRoma, the personification of the Roman state, had sprung up voluntarily in\r\nthe cities of Greece and Asia after 197 B. C. when the power of Rome began\r\nto supplant the authority of the Hellenistic monarchs for whom deification\r\nby their subjects was the theoretical basis of their autocratic power.\r\nThis voluntary worship had also been accorded to individual Romans, as\r\nFlamininus, Sulla, Caesar and Mark Antony. As early as 29 B. C. the cities\r\nof Pergamon in Asia and Nicomedia in Bithynia erected temples dedicated to\r\nRoma and Augustus, and established quinquennial religious festivals called\r\n_Romaia Sebasta_. Other cities followed their example and before the death\r\nof Augustus each province in the Orient had at least one altar dedicated\r\nto Roma and the princeps. From the East the imperial cult was officially\r\ntransplanted to the West.\r\n\r\nIn the year 12 B. C. an altar of Rome and Augustus was established at the\r\njunction of the rivers Rhone and Sâone, opposite the town of Lugdunum\r\n(modern Lyons), the administrative center of Transalpine Gaul apart from\r\nthe Narbonese province. Here the peoples of Gaul were to unite in the\r\noutward manifestation of their loyalty to Roman rule. A similar altar was\r\nerected at what is now Cologne in the land of the Ubii between 9 B. C. and\r\n9 A. D. Both in the East and in the West the maintenance of the imperial\r\ncult was imposed upon provincial councils, composed of representatives of\r\nthe municipal or tribal units in which each province was divided.\r\n\r\nThe imperial cult in the provinces was thus the expression of the absolute\r\nauthority of Rome and Augustus over the subjects of Rome, but for that\r\nvery reason Augustus could not admit its development on Italian soil; for\r\nto do so would be to deny his claim to be a Roman magistrate, deriving his\r\nauthority from the Roman people, among whom he was the chief citizen, and\r\nwould stamp his government as monarchical and autocratic. Therefore,\r\nalthough the poet Horace, voicing the public sentiment, in 27 B. C.\r\nacclaimed him as the new Mercury, and both municipalities and individuals\r\nin southern Italy spontaneously established his worship, this movement\r\nreceived no official encouragement and never became important. However,\r\nfrom the year 12 B. C. onwards, there were established religious colleges\r\nof _Augustales_, or priestly officers called _Sevìri Augustales_, in many\r\nItalian municipalities for the celebration of the cult of Augustus either\r\nalone or in conjunction with some other divinity such as Mercury or\r\nHercules. As these Augustales were almost exclusively drawn from the class\r\nof freedmen who were no longer admitted to full Roman citizenship,\r\nAugustus avoided receiving worship from the latter, while assuring himself\r\nof the loyalty of the _liberti_ and gratifying their pride by encouraging\r\na municipal office to which they were eligible.\r\n\r\n*The leges Juliae and the lex Papia Poppaea.* However, Augustus was not\r\ncontent to trust solely to the moral effects of religious exercises and\r\nresorted to legislative action to check the degenerate tendencies of his\r\nage. The Julian laws of 19 and 18 B. C. aimed at the restoration of the\r\nsoundness of family life, the encouragement of marriage, and the\r\ndiscouragement of childlessness, by placing disabilities upon unmarried\r\nand childless persons. These measures provoked great opposition, but\r\nAugustus was in earnest and supplemented his earlier laws by the _lex\r\nPapia Poppaea_ of 9 A. D. which gave precedence to fathers over less\r\nfortunate persons among the candidates for public office. A commentary on\r\nthe effectiveness of his earlier laws was the fact that both the consuls\r\nwho sponsored this later one were themselves unmarried. To prevent the\r\nItalian element among the citizens from being swamped by a continuous\r\ninflux of liberated slaves, Augustus placed restrictions upon the right of\r\nmanumission and refused freedmen the public rights of Roman citizens,\r\nalthough granting these to their sons. By example as well as by precept he\r\nsought to hold in check the luxurious tendencies of the age, and in his\r\nown household to furnish a model of ancient Roman simplicity.\r\n\r\n*The Secular Games, 17 B. C.* To publicly inaugurate the new era in the\r\nlife of the state begun under his auspices, Augustus celebrated the\r\nfestival of the Secular Games in the year 17 B. C., for which Horace wrote\r\nthe inaugural ode, his _Carmen Saeculare_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    V. THE PROVINCES AND THE FRONTIERS\r\n\r\n\r\n*The Dyarchy.* The division of the provinces between Augustus and the\r\nSenate in 27 B. C. had the effect of creating an administrative dyarchy,\r\nor joint rule of two independent authorities, for the empire. However, the\r\noriginal allotment of the provinces underwent some modification subsequent\r\nto 27 B. C. In 23 B. C., Augustus transferred to the Senate Narbonese Gaul\r\nwhere the rapid progress of colonization had made it “more a part of Italy\r\nthan a province.” In exchange he took over Illyricum, where the progress\r\nof the Roman arms had been interrupted by the outbreak of the war with\r\nAntony and where the Romans were confronted by warlike and restless\r\npeoples of the hinterland. Somewhat later Cilicia also became an imperial\r\nprovince and in 6 A. D. Sardinia was placed under an imperial procurator\r\nbecause of disturbances on the island. Southern Greece, previously\r\ndependent upon the province of Macedon, was placed under the government of\r\nthe Senate as the province of Achaea. New administrative districts\r\norganized by Augustus out of territories conquered by his generals\r\nremained under his control.\r\n\r\n*Survey and census of the empire.* The main expense of the military and\r\ncivil establishment of the empire was defrayed by the revenues from the\r\nprovinces. As a basis for an accurate estimate of their resources for\r\npurposes of taxation and recruitment Augustus caused a comprehensive\r\ncensus of the population and an evaluation of property to be taken in each\r\nnewly organized district, and provided for a systematic revision of the\r\ncensus in all the imperial provinces. In addition a general chart of the\r\nempire was compiled on the basis of an extended survey conducted under the\r\ndirection of Agrippa.\r\n\r\n*The foreign policy of Augustus.* As we have seen, Augustus since he was\r\ncommander-in-chief of the Roman armies and in charge of the administration\r\nof the most important border provinces, was entrusted by the senate with\r\nthe direction of the foreign relations of the state. Here his aims\r\nconformed to the general conservatism of his policies and were directed\r\ntowards securing a defensible frontier for the empire which should protect\r\nthe peace that he had established within its borders. His military\r\noperations were conducted with due regard to the man power and the\r\nfinancial resources of the state. To secure the defensible frontier at\r\nwhich he aimed it was necessary for Augustus to incorporate in the empire\r\na number of border peoples whose independence was a menace to the peace of\r\nthe provinces and to establish some client kingdoms as buffer states\r\nbetween Roman territory and otherwise dangerous neighbors.\r\n\r\n*The settlement in Spain.* The northwestern corner of the Spanish\r\npeninsula was still occupied by independent peoples, the Cantabri, Astures\r\nand the Callaeci, who harassed with their forays the pacified inhabitants\r\nof the Roman provinces. To secure peace in this quarter Augustus\r\ndetermined upon the complete subjugation of these peoples. From 27 to 24\r\nB. C. he was present in Spain and between these years his lieutenants\r\nAntistius, Carisius and Agrippa conducted campaigns against them in their\r\nmountain fastness, and, overcoming their desperate resistance, settled\r\nthem in the valleys and secured their territory by founding colonies of\r\nveterans. A subsequent revolt in 20–19 was crushed by Marcus Agrippa.\r\n\r\n*The pacification of the Alps, 25–8 B. C.* A similar problem was presented\r\nby the Alpine peoples, who not only made devastating raids into northern\r\nItaly but also in the west occupied the passes which offered the most\r\ndirect routes between Italy and Transalpine Gaul. In 26 B. C. occurred a\r\nrevolt of the Salassi, in the neighborhood of the Little St. Bernard, who\r\nhad been subdued eight years before. In the following year they were\r\ncompletely subjugated, and those who escaped slaughter were sold into\r\nslavery. In 16 B. C. the district of Noricum, i. e., modern Tyrol and\r\nSalzburg, was occupied by Publius Silius Nerva, in consequence of a raid\r\nof the Noricans into the Istrian peninsula. In 15 B. C., the step-son of\r\nAugustus, Nero Claudius Drusus, crossed the Brenner Pass and forced his\r\nway over the Vorarlberg range to Lake Constance, subduing the Raeti on his\r\nway. On the shores of Lake Constance he met his elder brother, Tiberius\r\nClaudius Nero, who had marched eastwards from Gaul. Together they defeated\r\nand subjugated the Vindelici. On the north the Danube was now the Roman\r\nfrontier. A number of isolated campaigns completed the subjugation of the\r\nremaining Alpine peoples by 8 B. C. Raetia and Noricum were organized as\r\nprocuratorial provinces, while the smaller Alpine districts were placed\r\nunder imperial prefects.\r\n\r\n*Gaul and Germany.* Caesar had left the land of Gallia Comata crushed but\r\nstill unsettled and not fully incorporated in the empire. It fell to the\r\nlot of Augustus to complete its organization, which was accomplished\r\nbetween 27 and 13 B. C. Subsequent to the transfer of the Narbonese\r\nprovince to the Senate _Gallia comata_ was divided into three districts;\r\nAquitania, Lugdunensis and Belgica, which, however, during the lifetime of\r\nAugustus, formed an administrative unity, under one governor with\r\nsubordinate _legati_ in each district. The colony of Lugdunum was the seat\r\nof the administration, as well as of the imperial cult. No attempt was\r\nmade to latinize the three Gauls by the founding of Roman colonies; but\r\nthey remained divided into sixty-four separate peoples, called\r\n_civitates_, with a tribal organization under the control of a native\r\nnobility. As early as 27 B. C. Augustus took a census in Gaul, and on this\r\nbasis fixed its tax obligations. The rich lands of Gaul were as important\r\na source of imperial revenue as its vigorous population was of recruits\r\nfor the Roman auxiliary forces.\r\n\r\nBut the Gauls were restive under their new burdens and were in addition\r\nliable to be stirred up by the Germanic tribes who came from across the\r\nRhine. An invading horde of Sugambri in 16 B. C. defeated a Roman army\r\nand, upon a renewed inroad by the same people in 12 B. C., Augustus\r\ndetermined to cross the Rhine and secure the frontier of Gaul by the\r\nsubjugation of the Germans to the north. The Germans, like the Gauls at\r\nthe time of the Roman conquest, were divided into a number of independent\r\ntribes usually at enmity with one another and hence incapable of forming a\r\nlasting combination against a common foe. Individually they were powerful\r\nand courageous, but their military efficiency was impaired by their lack\r\nof unity and discipline.\r\n\r\nDrusus, conqueror of the Raeti, was appointed to command the Roman army of\r\ninvasion. He first secured the Rhine frontier by the construction of a\r\nline of fortresses stretching from Vindonissa (near Basle) to Castra\r\nVetera (near Xanten), the latter of which, with Mogontiacum (Mainz) were\r\nhis chief bases. Then, crossing the river, in four campaigns (12–9 B. C.)\r\nhe overran and subjugated the territory between the Rhine and the Elbe.\r\nHis operations were greatly aided by his fleet, for which he constructed a\r\ncanal from the Rhine to the Zuider Zee, and which facilitated the conquest\r\nof the coast peoples, among them the Batavi, who became firm Roman allies.\r\nOn the return march from the Elbe in 9 B. C., Drusus was fatally injured\r\nby a fall from his horse. His brother Tiberius succeeded him in command\r\nand strengthened the Roman hold on the transrhenene conquests. Drusus was\r\nburied in Rome, whither Tiberius escorted his corpse on foot, and was\r\nhonored with the name Germanicus.\r\n\r\n*Illyricum and Thrace.* To the east of the Adriatic the Roman provinces of\r\nIllyricum and Macedonia were subject to constant incursions of the\r\nPannonians, Getae (or Dacians) and Bastarnae, peoples settled in the\r\nmiddle and lower Danube valley. Marcus Licinius Crassus, Governor of\r\nMacedonia, in 30 and 29 B. C. defeated the Getae and Bastarnae, crossed\r\nthe Balkans, carried the Roman arms to the Danube and subdued the Moesi to\r\nthe south of that river. However, it required a considerable time before\r\nthe various Thracian tribes were finally subdued and a client kingdom\r\nunder the Thracian prince Cotys was interposed between Macedonia and the\r\nlower Danube. Meantime, the Pannonians had been conquered in a number of\r\nhard fought campaigns which were brought to a successful conclusion by\r\nTiberius (12–9 B. C.) who made the Drave the Roman boundary. The\r\ncontemporaneous conquest of Pannonia and of Germany between the Rhine and\r\nthe Elbe was one of the greatest feats of Roman arms and reveals the army\r\nof the empire at the height of its discipline and organization. In 13\r\nB. C., during a lull in these frontier struggles, the Senate voted the\r\nerection of an altar to the peace of Augustus (the _ara pacis Augustae_),\r\nin grateful recognition of his maintenance of peace within the empire.\r\n\r\n*The revolt of Illyricum and Germany.* For several years following the\r\ndeath of Drusus no further conquests were attempted until 4 A. D., when\r\nTiberius was again appointed to command the army of the Rhine. After\r\nassuring himself of the allegiance of the Germans by a demonstration as\r\nfar as the Elbe and by the establishment of fortified posts, he prepared\r\nto complete the northern boundary by the conquest of the kingdom of the\r\nMarcomanni, in modern Bohemia, between the Elbe and the Danube. In 6 A. D.\r\nTiberius was on the point of advancing northward from the Danube, in\r\ncoöperation with Gaius Saturninus, who was to move eastwards from the\r\nRhine, when a revolt broke out in Illyricum which forced the abandonment\r\nof the undertaking and the conclusion of peace with Marbod, the king of\r\nthe Marcomanni. The revolt, in which both Pannonians and Dalmatians\r\njoined, was caused by the severity of the Roman exactions, especially the\r\nlevies for the army. For a moment Italy trembled in fear of an invasion;\r\nin the raising of new legions even freedmen were called into service. But\r\nthe arrival of reinforcements from other provinces enabled Tiberius after\r\nthree years of ruthless warfare to utterly crush the desperate resistance\r\nof the rebels (9 A. D.). The organization of Pannonia as a separate\r\nprovince followed the reëstablishment of peace.\r\n\r\nUntil the last year of the war in Illyricum the Germanic tribes had\r\nremained quiet under Roman overlordship. But in 9 A. D., provoked by the\r\nattempt of the new Roman commander, Publius Quinctilius Varus, to subject\r\nthem to stricter control, they united to free themselves from foreign\r\nrule. In the coalition the Cherusci and Chatti were the chief peoples, and\r\nArminius, a young chieftain of the Cherusci, was its leading spirit. Varus\r\nand his army of three legions were surprised on the march in the Teutoberg\r\nForest and completely annihilated. Rome was in panic over the news, but\r\nthe Germans did not follow up their initial success. Tiberius was again\r\nsent to the post of danger and vindicated the honor of Rome by two\r\nsuccessful expeditions across the Rhine. But no attempt was made to\r\nrecover permanently the lost ground. The frontier of the Elbe was given up\r\nfor that of the Rhine with momentous consequences for the future of the\r\nempire and of Europe. The coast peoples, however, remained Roman allies\r\nand a narrow strip of territory was held on the right bank of the Rhine.\r\nThe reason lay in the weakness of the Roman military organization, caused\r\nby the strain of the Illyrian revolt and the difficulty of finding\r\nrecruits for the Roman legions among the Italians. The cry of Augustus,\r\n“Quinctilius Varus, give back my legions,” gives the clue to his\r\nabandonment of Germany.\r\n\r\n*The eastern frontier.* In the East alone was Rome confronted by a power\r\nwhich was in any way a match for her military strength and which had\r\ndisastrously defeated two Roman invasions. The conquest of this, the\r\nParthian kingdom, appeared to Augustus to offer no compensation comparable\r\nto the exertions it would entail and therefore he determined to rest\r\ncontent with such a reassertion of Roman supremacy in the Near East as\r\nwould wipe out the shame of the defeats of Crassus and Antony and\r\nguarantee Roman territory from Parthian attack. He was prepared to accept\r\nthe natural frontier of the Euphrates as the eastern boundary of Roman\r\nterritory. Between the Roman provinces in Asia Minor and the upper\r\nEuphrates lay a number of client kingdoms, Galatia, Pontus, Cappadocia and\r\nLesser Armenia, and Commagene. At the death of Amyntas, king of Galatia,\r\nin 25 B. C., his kingdom was made into a province, but the others were\r\nleft under their native dynasts. Across the Euphrates lay Armenia, a\r\nbuffer state between the Roman possessions and Parthia, which was of\r\nstrategic importance because it commanded the military routes between Asia\r\nMinor and the heart of the Parthian country. To establish a protectorate\r\nover Armenia was therefore the ambition of both Rome and Parthia. During\r\nthe presence of Augustus in the East (22–19 B. C.), Tiberius placed a\r\nRoman nominee on the Armenian throne, and received from the Parthian king,\r\nPhraates IV, the Roman standards and captives in Parthian hands, a success\r\nwhich earned Augustus the salutation of _imperator_ from his troops. Later\r\nPhraates sent four of his sons as hostages to Rome. But the Roman\r\nprotectorate over Armenia was by no means permanent; its supporters had\r\nsoon to give way to the Parthian party. Gaius Caesar between 1 B. C. and 2\r\nA. D. restored Roman influence, but again the Parthians got the upper hand\r\nand held it until 9 A. D., when Phraates was overthrown and was succeeded\r\nby one of his sons whom Augustus sent from Rome at the request of the\r\nParthians.\r\n\r\n*Judaea and Arabia.* To the south of the Roman province of Syria lay the\r\nkingdom of Judaea, ruled by Herod until his death in 4 B. C., when it was\r\ndivided among his sons. Subsequently Judaea proper was made a province\r\nadministered by a Roman procurator. To the east of the Dead Sea was the\r\nkingdom of the Nabataean Arabs, who controlled the caravan routes of the\r\nArabian peninsula and who were firm Roman allies. With their aid a Roman\r\narmy under Aelius Gallus in 25 B. C. sought to penetrate into the rich\r\nspice land of Arabia Felix, but suffered such losses in its march across\r\nthe desert that it was forced to return without effecting a conquest. At\r\nthe same time Gaius Petronius defeated the Ethiopians under Queen Candace\r\nand secured the southern frontier of Egypt. Through the ports of Egypt on\r\nthe Red Sea a brisk trade developed with India, from which distant land\r\nembassies on various occasions came to Augustus. Further west in Africa,\r\nAugustus added the kingdom of Numidia to the province of Africa, and\r\ntransferred its ruler, Juba II, whose wife was Cleopatra, daughter of\r\nAntony the triumvir, to the kingdom of Mauretania (25 B. C.).\r\n\r\nThe conquests of Augustus established in their essential features the\r\nfuture boundaries of the Roman Empire. At his death he left it as a maxim\r\nof state for his successor to abstain from further expansion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      VI. THE ADMINISTRATION OF ROME\r\n\r\n\r\n*The problem of police.* One of the great problems which had confronted\r\nthe Roman government from the time of the Gracchi was the policing of Rome\r\nand the suppression of mob violence. To a certain extent the establishment\r\nof the praetorian guard served to overawe the city mob, although only\r\nthree of its cohorts were at first stationed in the city. As a supplement\r\nto the praetorians Augustus organized three urban cohorts, each originally\r\n1500 strong, who ranked between the legionaries and praetorians. Between\r\n12 and 7 B. C. the city was divided for administrative purposes into\r\nfourteen regions, subdivided into 265 _vici_ or wards. Each region was put\r\nin charge of a tribune or aedile. A force of six hundred slaves under the\r\ntwo curule aediles was formed as a fire brigade. But as these proved\r\nineffective in 6 A. D. Augustus created a corps of _vigiles_ to serve as a\r\nfire brigade and night watch. This corps consisted of seven cohorts, one\r\nfor every two regions, and was under the command of an equestrian prefect\r\nof the watch (_praefectus vigilum_).\r\n\r\n*The Annona.* Another vital problem was the provision of an adequate\r\nsupply of grain for the city. A famine in 22 B. C. produced so serious a\r\nsituation that the Senate was forced to call upon Augustus to assume the\r\nresponsibility for this branch of the administration. At first he tried to\r\nmeet the situation through the appointment of curators of senatorial rank,\r\nbut after 6 A. D. he created the office of prefect of the grain supply,\r\nfilled by an equestrian appointee of the princeps. His duty was to see\r\nthat there was an adequate supply of grain on hand for the market at a\r\nreasonable price and in addition to make the monthly distribution of free\r\ngrain to the city plebs. The number of recipients of this benefit was\r\nfixed at 200,000.\r\n\r\nIn this way Augustus was forced to take over one of the spheres of the\r\ngovernment which he had intended should remain under the direction of the\r\nSenate and to witness himself the first step towards the breakdown of the\r\nadministrative dyarchy which he had created.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    VII. THE PROBLEM OF THE SUCCESSION\r\n\r\n\r\n*The policy of Augustus.* In theory the position of the princeps was that\r\nof a magistrate who derived his powers from the Senate and the Roman\r\npeople, and hence the choice of his successor legally lay in their hands.\r\nHowever, Augustus realized that to leave the field open to rival\r\ncandidates would inevitably lead to a recrudescence of civil war.\r\nTherefore he determined to designate his own successor and to make the\r\nlatter’s appointment a matter beyond dispute. Furthermore, his own career\r\nas the son and heir of Julius Caesar warned him that this heir to the\r\nprincipate must be found within his own household, and his precarious\r\nhealth was a constant reminder that he could not await the approach of old\r\nage before settling this problem. And so, from the early years of his\r\noffice, he arranged the matrimonial alliances of his kinsfolk in the\r\ninterests of the state without regard to their personal preferences, to\r\nthe end that in the event of his decease there would be a member of the\r\nJulian house prepared to assume his laborious task. Yet the unexpected\r\nlength of his life caused Augustus to outlive many of those whom he from\r\ntime to time looked upon as the heirs to his position in the state.\r\n\r\n*Marcus Marcellus and Agrippa.* Augustus had one daughter Julia, by his\r\nsecond wife Scribonia. He had no sons, but Livia Drusilla, whom he took as\r\nhis third wife in 36 B. C., brought him two stepsons, Tiberius and Drusus.\r\nYet not one of these but his nephew, Marcus Marcellus, was his first\r\nchoice for a successor. Marcellus received Julia as his wife in 25 B. C.,\r\nthe next year at the age of nineteen he was admitted to the Senate, and in\r\n23 B. C., as aedile, he won the favor of the populace by his magnificent\r\npublic shows. When Marcellus died in 23 B. C., Augustus turned to his\r\nloyal adherent Agrippa, to whom Julia was now wedded. In 18 B. C. Agrippa\r\nreceived proconsular _imperium_ and the _tribunicia potestas_ for five\r\nyears, powers that were reconferred with those of Augustus in 13 B. C.\r\n\r\n*Tiberius.* But in the next year Agrippa died, and Augustus, regarding his\r\neldest stepson Tiberius, the conqueror of Noricum, as the one best\r\nqualified to succeed himself, forced him to divorce the wife to whom he\r\nwas devoted and to marry Julia. At that time he was given the important\r\nIllyrian command and in 6 B. C. the tribunician authority was granted him\r\nfor a five year term. But Tiberius, recognizing that he was soon to be set\r\naside for the two elder sons of Agrippa and Julia, Gaius and Lucius\r\nCaesar, whom Augustus had adopted and taken into his own house, and being\r\ndisgusted with the flagrant unfaithfulness of Julia, retired into private\r\nlife at Rhodes, thereby incurring the deep enmity of his stepfather.\r\n\r\n*Gaius and Lucius Caesar.* Gaius and Lucius Caesar assumed the garb of\r\nmanhood (the _toga virilis_) at the age of fifteen in 5 and 2 B. C.,\r\nrespectively. To celebrate each occasion Augustus held the consulship, and\r\nplaced them at the head of the equestrian order with the title _principes\r\niuventutis_. They were exempted from the limitations of the _cursus\r\nhonorum_ so that each might hold the consulate in his twentieth year. In 1\r\nA. D. Gaius was sent to the East with proconsular imperium to settle fresh\r\ntrouble in Armenia. There in the siege of a petty fortress he received a\r\nwound from which he died in 4 A. D. Two years previously Lucius had fallen\r\na victim to fever while on his way to Spain. In the meantime Augustus had\r\nexperienced another blow in his discovery of the scandalous conduct of\r\nJulia. Her guilt was the more unpardonable in view of the efforts of her\r\nfather to restore the moral tone of society. She was banished to the\r\nisland rock of Pandataria, her companions in crime were punished, the most\r\nwith banishment, one with death on a charge of treason (1 B. C.). Her\r\nelder daughter, also called Julia, later met the same fate for a like\r\noffence.\r\n\r\n*Tiberius.* At the death of Gaius Caesar, Augustus turned once more to\r\nTiberius, who had been permitted to leave Rhodes at the intercession of\r\nLivia. In 4 A. D. he was adopted by Augustus and received the _tribunicia\r\npotestas_ for ten years. In 13 A. D. his tribunician power was renewed and\r\nhe was made the colleague of Augustus in the _imperium_. Tiberius himself\r\nhad been obliged to adopt his nephew Germanicus, the son of Drusus, who\r\nmarried Agrippina, the younger daughter of Agrippa and Julia. Association\r\nin authority and adoption where necessary had become the means of\r\ndesignating the successor in the principate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      VIII. AUGUSTUS AS A STATESMAN\r\n\r\n\r\n*The death of Augustus.* In 14 A. D. Augustus held a census of the Roman\r\ncitizens in the empire. They numbered 4,937,000, an increase of 826,000\r\nsince 28 B. C. In the same year he set up in Rome an inscription recording\r\nhis exploits and the sums which he had expended in the interests of the\r\nstate. A copy of this has been found inscribed on the walls of the temple\r\nof Roma and Augustus at Ancyra, and hence is known as the Monument of\r\nAncyra. On 19 August, 14 A. D., Augustus died at Nola in Campania, at the\r\nage of seventy-six.\r\n\r\n*An estimate of his statesmanship.* Opinions have differed and probably\r\nalways will differ upon the question whether or not Augustus sought to\r\nestablish a disguised form of monarchical government. Still, in his favor\r\nstands the fact that, although when a young man confronted or allied with\r\nrivals who sought his destruction he seized power by illegal means, after\r\nthe fate of the state was in his hands and he had reëstablished an orderly\r\nform of government, he conscientiously restricted himself to the use of\r\nthe powers which were legally conferred upon him. So ably did he\r\nconciliate public opinion that the few conspiracies formed against his\r\nlife and power had no serious backing and constituted no real danger to\r\nhimself or his system. To have effected so important a change in the\r\nconstitution with so little friction is proof of a statesmanship of a high\r\norder.\r\n\r\nHis principate marks the beginning of a new epoch in Roman history and\r\ndetermined the course of the subsequent political development of the\r\nempire. And the system he inaugurated finds its greatest justification in\r\nthe era of the _pax Romana_ which it ushered in.\r\n\r\n*The weakness of his system.* Yet it must be admitted that this system\r\ncontained two innate weaknesses. Firstly, it was built up around the\r\npersonality of Augustus, who could trust himself not to abuse his great\r\npower, and secondly, the princeps, as commander-in-chief of the Roman\r\narmy, was immeasurably more powerful than the second partner in the\r\nadministration, the Senate, and able to assert his will against all\r\nopposition. Now, as has well been observed, the working of the principate\r\ndepended upon the coöperation of the Senate and the self-restraint of the\r\nemperors, consequently, when the former proved incapable and the latter\r\nabused their power, the inevitable consequence was an autocracy. That\r\nAugustus realized this himself towards the end of his life is highly\r\nprobable, yet as the one who brought order out of chaos and gave peace to\r\nan exhausted world his name will always be one of the greatest in the\r\nhistory of Rome or indeed of the human race.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n\r\n          THE JULIO-CLAUDIAN LINE AND THE FLAVIANS: 14–96 A. D.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         I. TIBERIUS, 14–37 A. D.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Tiberius princeps.* At the death of Augustus, Tiberius by right of his\r\n_imperium_ assumed command of the army and through his tribunician\r\nauthority convoked the Senate to pay the last honors to Augustus and\r\ndecide upon his successor. Like Julius Caesar, Augustus was deified, and a\r\npriestly college of Augustales, chosen from the senatorial order was\r\nfounded to maintain his worship in Rome. In accordance with a wish\r\nexpressed in his will, his widow Livia was honored with the name Augusta.\r\nTiberius received the title of Augustus and the other honors and powers\r\nwhich his predecessor had made the prerogatives of the princeps. His\r\n_imperium_, however, was conferred for life, and not for a limited period.\r\nThe ease of his succession shows how solidly the principate was\r\nestablished at the death of its founder.\r\n\r\n*Character and policy.* Tiberius was now fifty-six years of age. He had\r\nspent the greater part of his life in the public service, and consequently\r\nhad a full appreciation of the burden of responsibility which the princeps\r\nmust assume. He was the incarnation of the old Roman sense of duty to the\r\nstate, and at the same time exhibited the proud reserve of the Roman\r\npatricians. Stern in his maintenance of law and order, he made an\r\nexcellent subordinate, but when called upon to guide the policy of state,\r\nhe displayed hesitation and lack of decision. The incidents of his\r\nmarriage with Julia and his exile had rendered him bitter and suspicious,\r\nand he utterly lacked the personal charm and adaptability of his\r\npredecessor. Thus he was temperamentally unsuited to the position he was\r\ncalled upon to fill and this was responsible for his frequent\r\nmisunderstandings with the Senate. Such an incident occurred in the\r\nmeetings of the Senate after the death of Augustus. Tiberius, conscious of\r\nhis unpopularity, sought to have the Senate press upon him the appointment\r\nas the successor of Augustus, and so feigned reluctance to accept, a\r\ncourse which made the senators suspect that he was laying a trap for\r\npossible rivals. Yet there was no princeps who tried more conscientiously\r\nto govern in the spirit of Augustus, or upheld more rigidly the rights and\r\ndignity of the Senate. At the beginning of his principate he transferred\r\nfrom the Assembly to the Senate the right of the election to the\r\nmagistracies, thus relieving the senators from the expense and annoyance\r\nof canvassing the populace.\r\n\r\n*Mutinies in Illyricum and on the Rhine.* Two serious mutinies followed\r\nthe accession of Tiberius, one in the army stationed in Illyricum, the\r\nother among the legions on the Rhine. Failure to discharge those who had\r\ncompleted their terms of service and the severity of the service itself\r\nwere the grounds of dissatisfaction. The Illyrian mutiny was quelled by\r\nthe praetorian prefect Lucius Aelius Seianus; the army of the Rhine was\r\nbrought back to its allegiance by Germanicus, the son of Drusus, whom\r\nTiberius had adopted at the command of Augustus in 4 A. D. He had married\r\nAgrippina, daughter of Agrippa and Julia, and was looked upon as the heir\r\nof Tiberius in preference to the latter’s younger and less able son,\r\nDrusus.\r\n\r\n*The campaigns of Germanicus, 14–17 A. D.* To restore discipline among his\r\ntroops and relieve them from the monotony of camp life, as well as to\r\nemulate the achievements of his father, Germanicus, without the\r\nauthorization of Tiberius, led his army across the Rhine. The German\r\ntribes were still united in the coalition formed in the time of Varus,\r\nand, under their leaders Arminius and Inguiomerus, offered vigorous\r\nopposition to the Roman invasion. Nevertheless, in three successive\r\ncampaigns (14–16 A. D.), Germanicus ravaged the territory between the\r\nRhine and the Weser and inflicted several defeats upon the Germans. Still\r\nArminius and his allies were by no means subdued, and the Romans had\r\nsustained heavy losses. One army had narrowly escaped the fate of the\r\nlegions of Varus, and twice had the transports of Germanicus suffered\r\nthrough storms in the North Sea. For these reasons Tiberius forbade the\r\nprolongation of the war and recalled Germanicus. With his departure, each\r\nof the three Gauls was made an independent province, and two new\r\nadministrative districts called Upper and Lower Germany, under legates of\r\nconsular rank, were created on the left bank of the Rhine. Freed from the\r\ndanger of Roman interference, the Germanic tribes led by Arminius now\r\nengaged in a bitter struggle with Marbod, king of the Marcomanni, which\r\nultimately led to the overthrow of the latter’s kingdom. Not long\r\nafterwards Arminius himself fell a victim to the jealousy of his fellow\r\ntribesmen (19 A. D.).\r\n\r\n*Eastern mission and death of Germanicus, 17–19 A. D.* After his return\r\nfrom Gaul, Germanicus was sent by Tiberius to settle affairs in the East,\r\nwhere the Armenian question had again become acute. While he was in Syria,\r\na bitter quarrel developed between himself and Piso, the legate of the\r\nprovince. Accordingly, when Germanicus fell ill and died there, many\r\naccused Piso of having poisoned him. Although the accusation was false\r\nPiso was called to Rome to stand his trial on that charge, and, finding\r\nthat the popularity of Germanicus had biased popular opinion against him,\r\nand that Tiberius refused him his protection because of his attempt to\r\nassert his rights by armed force, he committed suicide. Agrippina, the\r\nambitious wife of Germanicus, believed that Tiberius from motives of\r\njealousy had been responsible for her husband’s death. She openly\r\ndisplayed her hostility to the princeps, and by plotting to secure the\r\nsuccession for her own children, helped to bring about their ruin and her\r\nown.\r\n\r\n*The withdrawal of Tiberius from Rome, 26 A. D.* The decision of Tiberius\r\nto leave Rome in 26 A. D. and take up his residence on the island of Capri\r\nhad important consequences. One was that the office of city prefect, who\r\nwas the representative of the princeps, became permanent. It was filled by\r\na senator of consular rank who commanded the urban cohorts and had wide\r\njudicial functions.\r\n\r\n*The plot of Seianus.* In the second place the absence of Tiberius gave\r\nhis able and ambitious praetorian prefect Aelius Seianus encouragement and\r\nopportunity to perfect the plot he had formed to seize the principate for\r\nhimself. He it was who concentrated the praetorian guard, now 10,000\r\nstrong, in their camp on the edge of the city, and paved the way for their\r\nbaneful influence upon the future history of the principate. Having caused\r\nthe death of Drusus, the son of Tiberius, by poison, in 23 A. D., he\r\nintrigued to remove from his path the sons of Germanicus, Drusus and Nero.\r\nThey and their mother Agrippina were condemned to imprisonment or exile on\r\ncharges of treason. In 31 A. D. Seianus attained the consulate and\r\nreceived proconsular _imperium_ in the provinces. He allied himself with\r\nthe Julian house by his betrothal to Julia, the grand-daughter of\r\nTiberius. But in the same year the princeps became aware of his plans.\r\nTiberius acted with energy. Seianus and many of his supporters were\r\narrested and executed.\r\n\r\n*The last years of Tiberius.* The discovery of Seianus’ treachery seems to\r\nhave affected the reason of the aging princeps. His fear of treachery\r\nbecame an obsession. The law of treason (_lex de maiestate_) was\r\nrigorously enforced and many persons were condemned to death, among them\r\nAgrippina and her sons. The senators lived in terror of being accused by\r\ninformers (_delatores_), and in their anxiety to conciliate the princeps\r\nthey were only too ready to condemn any of their own number.\r\n\r\nThe memory of his later years caused Tiberius to pass down in the\r\ntraditions of the senatorial order, represented by Tacitus and Suetonius,\r\nas a ruthless tyrant, and to obscure his real services as a conscientious\r\nand economical administrator. His parsimony in expenditures of the public\r\nmoney won him unpopularity with the city mob, but was a blessing to the\r\nprovincials to whose welfare Tiberius directed particular attention, while\r\nhe vigorously protected them against the oppression of imperial officials.\r\nDuring his rule the peace of the empire was disturbed only by a brief\r\nrising in Gaul (21 A. D.) and a rather prolonged struggle with Tacfarinas,\r\na rebellious Berber chieftain, in Numidia (17–24 A. D.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     II. CAIUS CALIGULA, 37–41 A. D.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Accession.* Tiberius left as his heirs his adoptive grandson Caius, the\r\nsole surviving son of Germanicus, better known by his childhood name of\r\nCaligula, acquired in the camps on the Rhine, and his grandson by birth,\r\nTiberius Gemellus. Upon Caius, the elder of the two, then twenty-five\r\nyears of age, the Senate immediately conferred the powers of the\r\nprincipate. The resentment of the senators towards his predecessor found\r\nvent in refusing him the posthumous honor of deification. Caius adopted\r\nhis cousin, but within a year had him put to death.\r\n\r\n*Early months of his rule.* The early months of his rule seemed the dawn\r\nof a new era. The pardoning of political offenders, the banishment of\r\ninformers, the reduction of taxes, coupled with lavishness in public\r\nentertainments and donations, all made Gaius popular with the Senate, the\r\narmy and the city plebs. However, he was a weakling in body and in mind,\r\nand a serious illness, brought on by his excesses, seems to have left him\r\nmentally deranged.\r\n\r\n*Absolutism his ideal.* Reared in the house of Antonia, daughter of Antony\r\nand Octavia, in company with eastern princes of the stamp of Herod\r\nAgrippa, he naturally came to look upon the principate as an autocracy of\r\nthe Hellenistic type. In his attempt to carry this conception into effect,\r\nthe vein of madness in his character led him to ridiculous extremes. Not\r\ncontent with claiming deification for himself and his sisters, he built a\r\nlofty bridge connecting the Palatine Hill with the Capitoline, so that he\r\nmight communicate with Jupiter, his brother god. He prescribed the\r\nsacrifices to be offered to himself, and was accused of seeking to imitate\r\nthe Ptolemaic custom of sister marriage. Thoroughly consistent with\r\nabsolutism was his scorn of republican magistracies and disregard of the\r\nrights of the Senate; likewise his attempt to have himself saluted as\r\n_dominus_ or “lord.”\r\n\r\n*The conflict with the Jews.* His demand for the acknowledgment of his\r\ndeification by all inhabitants of the empire brought Caius into conflict\r\nwith the Jews, who had been exempted from this formal expression of\r\nloyalty. In Alexandria there was a large Jewish colony, which enjoyed\r\nexceptional privileges and was consequently hated by the other\r\nAlexandrians. Their refusal to worship the images of Caius furnished the\r\nmob with a pretext for sacking the Jewish quarters and forcibly installing\r\nstatues of the princeps in some of their synagogues. The Jews sent a\r\ndelegation to plead their case before Caius but could obtain no redress.\r\nIn the meantime Caius had ordered Petronius, the legate of Syria, to set\r\nup his statue in the temple at Jerusalem, by force, if need be. However,\r\nthe prudent Petronius, seeing that this would bring about a national\r\nrevolt among the Jews delayed obeying the order, and the death of Caius\r\nrelieved him of the necessity of executing it at all.\r\n\r\n*Tyranny.* In less than a year the reckless extravagance of Caius had\r\nexhausted the immense surplus Tiberius had left in the treasury. To secure\r\nnew funds he resorted to openly tyrannical measures, extraordinary taxes,\r\njudicial murders, confiscations, and forced legacies. By these means money\r\nwas extorted not only from Romans of all classes but provincials also.\r\nPtolemy, king of Mauretania, was executed for the sake of his treasure and\r\nhis kingdom made a province.\r\n\r\n*Assassination.* Caius contemplated invasions of Germany and of Britain,\r\nbut the former ended with a military parade across the Rhine and the\r\nlatter with a march to the shores of the Straits of Dover. The fear\r\nawakened by his rule of capricious violence soon resulted in conspiracies\r\nagainst his life. In January, 41 A. D., he was assassinated by a tribune\r\nof the imperial guards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        III. CLAUDIUS, 41–54 A. D.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Nominated by the Praetorians.* In the choice of a successor to Caius the\r\npower of the praetorian guard was first clearly demonstrated. Caius was\r\nthe last male representative of the Julian _gens_, and at his death the\r\nSenate debated the question of restoring the republic. However, the\r\ndecision was made for them by the praetorians, who dragged from his hiding\r\nplace and saluted as Imperator the surviving brother of Germanicus,\r\nTiberius Claudius Germanicus. The Senate had to acquiesce in his\r\nnomination and grant him the powers of the princeps.\r\n\r\n*Character.* Claudius was already fifty-one years old, but because of his\r\nungainly figure and limited mentality had never been seriously considered\r\nfor the principate. He was learned and pedantic, but lacking in energy and\r\nresolution. His greatest weakness was that he was completely under the\r\ninfluence of his wives, of whom he had in succession four, and his\r\nfavorite freedmen.\r\n\r\n*Policy.* In general the policy of Claudius followed that of Augustus and\r\nTiberius. But in 47 A. D. he assumed the censorship for five years, an\r\noffice which Augustus had avoided because it set its holder directly above\r\nthe Senate.\r\n\r\nIn the capacity of censor, Claudius extended to the Gallic Aedui the _jus\r\nhonorum_ and consequently the right of admission to the Senate. This was\r\nin accord with his policy of generously granting citizenship to the\r\nprovincials. The census taken in 47 and 48 A. D. showed approximately six\r\nmillion Romans, nearly a million more than in the time of Augustus.\r\nClaudius also renewed the attempt of Julius Caesar to occupy the island of\r\nBritain. In 43 A. D. his legates Aulus Plautius, Vespasian and Ostorius\r\nScapula subdued the island as far as the Thames, and in the following\r\nyears extended their conquests farther northward. The southern part of the\r\nisland became the province of Britain. In 46 A. D., Thrace was\r\nincorporated as a province at the death of its client prince.\r\n\r\n*Influence of freedmen.* During the rule of Claudius the real heads of the\r\nadministration were a group of able freedmen, Narcissus, Pallas, Polybius\r\nand, later, Callistus. While it is true that they abused their power to\r\namass riches for themselves, they contributed a great deal to the\r\norganization of the imperial bureaucracy. Their influence caused the\r\nwidespread employment of imperial freedmen in procuratorial positions.\r\n\r\n*Agrippina the younger.* In 49 A. D. the plot of Messalina, the third wife\r\nof Claudius, and her lover Gaius Silius, to depose the princeps in favor\r\nof Silius, endangered the power of the trio Pallas, Narcissus and\r\nCallistus. It was Narcissus who revealed the conspiracy to Claudius,\r\nsecured his order for the execution of Messalina, and saw that it was\r\ncarried into effect. But it was Pallas who induced the princeps to take as\r\nhis fourth wife his own niece Agrippina, whose ambitions were to prove his\r\nruin.\r\n\r\n*Death of Claudius.* By Messalina Claudius had a son Britannicus and a\r\ndaughter Octavia, but Agrippina determined to secure the succession for\r\nDomitius, her son by her previous husband Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus. In\r\n50 A. D., Domitius was adopted by Claudius as Nero Claudius Caesar. The\r\nfollowing year he received the _imperium_, and was thus openly designated\r\nas the future princeps. In 53 A. D. Nero was married to Octavia and a year\r\nlater Claudius died, poisoned, as all believed, by Agrippina, who feared\r\nthat further delay would endanger her plans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          IV. NERO, 54–68 A. D.\r\n\r\n\r\n*The quinquennium Neronis.* Agrippina had previously made sure of the\r\nsupport of the praetorians, and so the appointment of Nero to the\r\nprincipate transpired without opposition. The first five years of his rule\r\nwere noted as a period of excellent administration. During that time his\r\ncounsels were guided by the praetorian prefect, Afranius Burrus from\r\nNarbonese Gaul, and by Lucius Annaeus Seneca, the famous writer and orator\r\nfrom Spain, whom Agrippina had appointed as his tutor in 49 A. D.\r\n\r\n*Fall of Agrippina.* This epoch is also characterized by the attempt of\r\nAgrippina to act as regent for her son and retain the influence she had\r\nacquired during the later years of the life of Claudius. But in this she\r\nwas opposed both by Nero himself and his able advisors. In 55 A. D. Nero\r\ncaused his adoptive brother Britannicus to be poisoned, through fear that\r\nhe might prove a rival. Finally, under the influence of his mistress,\r\nPoppaea Sabina, the wife of Titus Salvius Otho, he had Agrippina murdered\r\n(59 A. D.). Thereupon he divorced Octavia, who was later banished and put\r\nto death, and married Poppaea.\r\n\r\n*The government of Nero.* Freed from the fear of any rival influence,\r\nNero, now twenty-two years of age, took the reins of government into his\r\nown hands. After the death of Burrus in 62, Seneca lost his influence over\r\nthe princeps, who took as his chief advisor the worthless praetorian\r\nprefect, Tigellinus. The Senate, whose support he had courted in his\r\nopposition to Agrippina, now found itself without any influence; and,\r\nsince his wanton extravagances emptied the treasury, Nero was forced to\r\nresort to oppressive measures to satisfy his needs. The sole object of his\r\npolicy was the gratification of his capricious whims. In the conviction\r\nthat he was an artist of extraordinary genius, he hungered for the\r\napplause of the successful performer, and in 65 A. D. publicly appeared in\r\nthe theatre as a singer and musician. Nothing could have more deeply\r\nalienated the respect of the upper classes of Roman society. Eager to\r\nduplicate his theatrical successes in the home of the Muses, in 66 A. D.\r\nNero visited Greece and exhibited his talent at the Olympian and Delphic\r\ngames.\r\n\r\n*The fire in Rome and the first persecution of the Christians, 64 A. D.*\r\nIn 64 A. D. a tremendous fire, which lasted for six continuous days and\r\nbroke out a second time, devastated the greater part of the city of Rome.\r\nSubsequently, Nero was accused of having caused the fire, but there is\r\nabsolutely no proof of his guilt. However, he did seize the opportunity to\r\nrebuild the damaged quarter on a new plan which did away with the\r\noffensive slum districts, and to erect his famous “Golden House,” a\r\nmagnificent palace and park on the Esquiline. Popular opinion demanded\r\nsome scapegoat for the disaster, and Nero laid the blame upon the\r\nChristians in Rome, possibly at the instigation of the Jews whose\r\ncommunity was divided by the spread of Christian doctrines. Many\r\nChristians were condemned as incendiaries, and suffered painful and\r\nignominious deaths. This was the first persecution of the Christians.\r\n\r\n*The Armenian problem, 51–67 A. D.* In 51 A. D. an able and ambitious\r\nruler, Vologases, came to the Parthian throne. He soon found a chance to\r\nset his brother Tiridates on the throne of Armenia and was able to\r\nmaintain him there until the death of Claudius. However, at the accession\r\nof Nero, Caius Domitius Corbulo was sent to Cappadocia to reassert the\r\nRoman suzerainty over Armenia. At first Vologases abandoned Armenia, owing\r\nto a revolt in Parthia, but in 58 A. D. Tiridates reappeared on the scene\r\nand war broke out. In two campaigns Corbulo was able to occupy the country\r\nand set up a Roman nominee as the Armenian king (60 A. D.). It was not\r\nlong before the latter was driven out by Vologases, who succeeded in\r\nsurrounding a Roman force under Caesennius Paetus, the new commander in\r\nCappadocia, and forcing him to purchase his safety by concluding an\r\nagreement favorable to the Parthian (62 A. D.). The situation was saved by\r\nCorbulo, then legate of Syria, who was finally entrusted with the sole\r\ncommand of operations and forced Vologases to meet the Roman terms (63\r\nA. D.). Tiridates retained the Armenian throne, but acknowledged the Roman\r\noverlordship by coming to Rome to receive his crown from Nero’s hands.\r\n\r\n*The revolt in Britain, 60 A. D.* Under Claudius the Romans had extended\r\ntheir dominion in Britain as far north as the Humber, and westwards to\r\nCornwall and Wales. In 59 A. D. Suetonius Paulinus occupied the island of\r\nMona (Anglesea), the chief seat of the religion of the Druids. While he\r\nwas engaged in this undertaking a serious revolt broke out among the Iceni\r\nand Trinovantes, who lived between the Wash and the Thames. It was caused\r\nby the severity of the Roman administration and in particular the\r\nill-treatment of Boudicca, the queen of the Iceni, who headed the\r\ninsurrection, by Roman procurators. The Roman towns of Camulodunum\r\n(Colchester), Verulamium (St. Alban’s), and Londinium (London) were\r\ndestroyed, and 70,000 Romans were said to have been massacred. A Roman\r\nlegion was defeated in battle and it was not until Paulinus returned and\r\nunited the scattered Roman forces that the insurgents were checked. The\r\nBritons were decisively defeated and Boudicca committed suicide.\r\n\r\n*The conspiracy of Piso, 65 A. D.* About 62 A. D. there began a long\r\nseries of treason trials in Rome occasioned partly by the desire to\r\nconfiscate the property of the accused and partly by the suspicion which\r\nis the inevitable concomitant of tyranny. The resulting insecurity of the\r\nsenatorial order naturally produced a real attempt to overthrow the\r\nprinceps. A wide-reaching conspiracy, in which one of the praetorian\r\nprefects was involved and which was headed by the senator Gaius Calpurnius\r\nPiso, was discovered in 65 A. D. Among those who were executed for\r\ncomplicity therein were the poet Lucan and his uncle Seneca. Other notable\r\nvictims of Nero’s vengeance were Thrasea Paetus and Borea Sonarus, the\r\nStoic senators, whose guilt was their silent but unmistakable disapproval\r\nof his tyrannical acts. No man of prominence was safe; even the famous\r\ngeneral Corbulo was forced to commit suicide in 67 A. D.\r\n\r\n*The rebellion of Vindex, 68 A. D.* Upon Nero’s return from Greece, a more\r\nserious movement began in Gaul where Caius Julius Vindex, the legate of\r\nthe province of Lugdunensis, raised the standard of revolt and was\r\nsupported by the provincials who were suffering under the pressure of\r\ntaxation. Vindex was joined by Sulpicius Galba, governor of Hither Spain,\r\nand other legates. The commander of Upper Germany, Verginius Rufus, who\r\nremained true to Nero, defeated Vindex, but, the revolt spread to the\r\ntroops of Verginius himself and these hailed their commander as imperator.\r\nHe, however, refused the honor and gave the Senate the opportunity to name\r\nthe princeps. Nero’s fate was sealed by his own cowardice and the\r\ntreachery of the prefect Sabinus, who bought the support of the praetorian\r\nguards for Galba. The Senate followed their lead, and Nero, who had fled\r\nfrom Rome, had himself killed by a faithful freedman. With him ends the\r\nJulio-Claudian dynasty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. THE FIRST WAR OF THE LEGIONS OR THE YEAR OF THE FOUR EMPERORS, 68–69 A.\r\n                                    D.\r\n\r\n\r\n*The power of the army.* The year 68–69 witnessed the accession of four\r\nemperors, each the nominee of the soldiery. And, while up to this time the\r\npraetorians had exercised the right of acclamation in the name of the army\r\nas a whole, now the legions stationed on the various frontiers asserted\r\nfor themselves the same privilege. As Tacitus expresses it, the fatal\r\nsecret of the empire was discovered, namely, that the princeps could be\r\nnominated elsewhere than in Rome. Although the principate may be said to\r\nhave been founded by the universal consent of the Roman world,\r\nnevertheless, from its inception the power of the princeps had rested\r\ndirectly upon his military command, and the civil war of 68–69 showed how\r\ncompletely the professional army was master of the situation.\r\n\r\n*Galba, 68 A. D.* Galba, who succeeded Nero, was a man of good family but\r\nmoderate attainments and soon showed himself unable to maintain his\r\nauthority. That he would have been held “fit to rule, had he not ruled,”\r\nis the judgment of Tacitus. He had never been enthusiastically supported\r\nby the Rhine legions nor the praetorians, and his severity in maintaining\r\ndiscipline, added to his failure to pay the promised donative, completely\r\nalienated the loyalty of the guards. At the news that the troops in Upper\r\nand Lower Germany had declared for Aulus Vitellius, legate of the latter\r\nprovince (1 Jan., 69), Galba sought to strengthen his position by adopting\r\nas his son and destined successor, Lucius Calpurnius Piso, a young man of\r\nhigh birth but no experience. By this step he offended Marcus Salvius\r\nOtho, the onetime husband of Nero’s wife Poppaea Sabina, who had been one\r\nof Galba’s staunch adherents and hoped to succeed him. Otho now won over\r\nthe disgruntled praetorian guards who slew Galba and Piso, and proclaimed\r\nOtho Imperator.\r\n\r\n*Otho, Jan.–April, 69.* The Senate acquiesced in their decision but not so\r\nthe legions of Vitellius which were already on the march to Italy. They\r\ncrossed the Alps without opposition but were checked by the forces of Otho\r\nat Bedriacum, north of the Po. Without waiting for the arrival of\r\nreinforcements from the Danubian army, Otho ordered an attack upon the\r\nVitellians at Cremona. His army was defeated and he took his own life.\r\n\r\n*Vitellius, April–December, 69 A. D.* Thereupon Vitellius was recognized\r\nas princeps by the Senate and his forces occupied Rome. Vitellius owed his\r\nnomination to the energy of the legates Valens and Caecina, and, although\r\nwell-meaning and by no means tyrannical, showed himself lacking in energy\r\nand force of character. He was unable to control the license of his\r\nsoldiery who plundered the Italian towns or his officers who enriched\r\nthemselves at the public expense, while he devoted himself to the\r\npleasures of the table.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the army of the East, which had recognized Galba, Otho and, at\r\nfirst, Vitellius also, set up its own Imperator, Titus Flavius\r\nVespasianus, who as legate of Judaea was conducting a war against the\r\nJews. Vespasian himself proceeded to occupy Egypt and thus cut off the\r\ngrain supply of Rome while his ablest lieutenant, Mucianus, set out for\r\nItaly. The Danubian legions, who had supported Otho, now declared\r\nthemselves for Vespasian and, led by Antonius Primus, marched at once upon\r\nItaly. The fleet at Ravenna espoused Vespasian’s cause, and Caecina, who\r\nled the Vitellians against Primus, contemplated treachery. His troops,\r\nhowever, were loyal, but were defeated in a bloody night battle at Cremona\r\nand the way lay open to Rome. Vitellius then opened negotiations and\r\noffered to abdicate, but his soldiers would not let him and suppressed a\r\nrising in Rome led by the brother of Vespasian. Thereupon the city was\r\nstormed and sacked by the army of Primus. Vitellius himself was slain.\r\n\r\n*Vespasian, December, 69 A. D.* Vespasian obtained his recognition as\r\nprinceps from the Senate and the troops in the West. He entered Rome early\r\nin 70 A. D.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   VI. VESPASIAN AND TITUS, 69–81 A. D.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Caesar an imperial title.* Following the example of Galba, Vespasian on\r\nhis accession took the name of Caesar, which became from this time a\r\nprerogative of the family of the princeps. The new princeps inherited from\r\nhis predecessors two serious wars, both national revolts against Roman\r\nrule, the one in Gaul and Lower Germany, the other in Judaea.\r\n\r\n*The revolt of the Batavi, 69 A. D.* The movement in Lower Germany was\r\nheaded by Julius Civilis, a Batavian chieftain, formerly an officer in the\r\nRoman service, who won over the eight Batavian cohorts attached to the\r\nRhine army. At first he posed as a supporter of Vespasian against\r\nVitellius, but at the news of the former’s victory he renounced his\r\nallegiance to Rome and called to his aid Germanic tribes from across the\r\nRhine. At the same time the Gallic Treveri and Lingones, the former led by\r\nJulius Classicus and Julius Tutor, the latter by Julius Sabinus, rose in\r\nrebellion and sought to establish an empire of the Gauls with its capital\r\nat Trèves (Augusta Treverorum). They were joined by the Roman legions\r\nstationed on the Rhine. However, the remaining peoples of Gaul refused to\r\njoin the revolt, preferring the Roman peace to a renewal of the old\r\nintertribal struggles.\r\n\r\nUpon the arrival of an adequate Roman force despatched by Vespasian the\r\nmutinous legions returned to their duty, the Treveri and Lingones were\r\nsubdued, and Civilis forced to flee into Germany. The Batavi returned to\r\ntheir former status of Roman allies under the obligation of furnishing\r\ntroops to the Roman armies (70 A. D.). But Rome had seen the danger of\r\nstationing national corps under their native officers in their home\r\ncountries. Henceforth the auxiliaries were no longer organized on a\r\nnational basis and served in provinces other than those in which they were\r\nrecruited.\r\n\r\n*The Jewish War, 66–70 A. D.* From the year 6 A. D. Judaea had formed a\r\nRoman procuratorial province except for its brief incorporation in the\r\nprincipality of Agrippa I (41–44 A. D.). During this time the Jews had\r\noccupied a privileged position among the Roman subjects, being exempted\r\nfrom military service and the obligation of the imperial cult,\r\nnotwithstanding the design of Caligula to set up his image in the temple\r\nat Jerusalem. These privileges were the source of constant friction\r\nbetween the Jews and the Greco-Syrian inhabitants of the cities of\r\nPalestine, which frequently necessitated the interference of Roman\r\nofficials. Another cause of unrest was the pressure of the Roman taxation,\r\nwhich rendered agriculture unprofitable and drove many persons from the\r\nplains to the mountains to find a livelihood through brigandage. But a\r\nmore deeply-seated cause of animosity to Roman rule lay in the fact that\r\nthe Jewish people were a religious community and that for them national\r\nloyalty was identical with religious fanaticism. The chief Jewish sects\r\nwere those of the Sadducees and the Pharisees, of whom the former composed\r\nthe aristocracy and the latter the democracy. The Sadducees were supported\r\nby the Romans and monopolized the offices of the religious community,\r\nwhereas the Pharisees courted the support of the masses by a policy of\r\nhostility to Rome and religious intolerance. It is improbable that the\r\nPharisees actually sought to bring about a revolt but they kindled a fire\r\nwhich they could not control and strengthened the development of a party\r\nof direct action, the Zealots, who aimed to liberate Judaea from the Roman\r\nforce, trusting in the support of Jehovah. By 66 A. D. all Judaea was in a\r\nferment and it required but little incitement to produce a national\r\nrevolt.\r\n\r\n*Massacres in Caesarea and Jerusalem, 66 A. D.* Such a provocation was\r\nafforded by the decision of the Roman government that Jews were not\r\nentitled to citizenship in Caesarea, the Roman capital of Judaea, and by a\r\nmassacre of the Jews by the Greeks in a riot which followed. However, at\r\nthe same time in Jerusalem the Zealots had overpowered the Roman garrison\r\nof one cohort, and massacred both the Romans and their Jewish supporters.\r\nAt the news, further massacres took place in the towns of Syria and Egypt,\r\nthe Jews suffering wherever they were in a minority but avenging their\r\ncountrymen where they got the upper hand. The Romans awoke to the\r\nseriousness of the situation when the legate of Syria, Cestius Gallus, who\r\nhad marched on Jerusalem, was forced to beat an ignominious retreat.\r\n\r\n*Vespasian in command, 67 A. D.* In 67 A. D. Vespasian was appointed to\r\nthe command of an army of 50,000 assembled for the reconquest of Judaea.\r\nIn this and the following year he reduced the open country and isolated\r\nfortresses, and was ready to begin the blockade of Jerusalem, where the\r\nmajority of the Jews had fled for refuge. However, Vespasian’s elevation\r\nto the principate caused a suspension of hostilities for ten months,\r\nduring which factional strife raged fiercely within the city.\r\n\r\n*Siege of Jerusalem, 70 A. D.* The conclusion of the war Vespasian\r\nentrusted to his eldest son Titus, who at once began the siege of\r\nJerusalem (70 A. D.). The city had a double line of fortifications, and\r\nwithin the inner wall were two natural citadels, the temple and the old\r\ncity of Mount Zion. The population, augmented by great numbers of\r\nrefugees, suffered terribly from hunger but resisted with the fury of\r\ndespair. The outer and inner walls were stormed, and then the Romans\r\nforced their way into the temple which was destroyed by fire. Mount Zion\r\ndefied assault but was starved into submission. Jerusalem was destroyed,\r\nand Judaea became a province under an imperial legate. The political\r\ncommunity of the Jews was dissolved and they were subjugated to a yearly\r\nhead-tax of two denarii (40 cents) each, payable to the temple of Jupiter\r\nCapitolinus, in consideration of which they enjoyed their previous\r\nimmunities. The victory of Titus was commemorated by the arch which still\r\nstands near the Roman forum.\r\n\r\n*The frontiers.* The disorders of the recent wars rendered it necessary\r\nfor Vespasian to reorganize many branches of the administration, a task\r\nwhich won for him the name of the second founder of the principate. The\r\nsecurity of the frontiers received his particular attention. In Germany he\r\nannexed the territory between the Rhine above its junction with the Main\r\nand the upper Danube, henceforth known as the Agri Decumates from the\r\ntithe (_decuma_) paid as rental by colonists who settled there. Further\r\neast on the Danube two strong legionary camps were constructed at\r\nCarnuntum and Vindobona (Vienna). The Euphrates frontier was strengthened\r\nby the establishment of Roman garrisons at Melitene and Satala on the\r\nUpper Euphrates, and by annexing to the Syrian province the kingdom of\r\nCommagene, which Gaius had restored to its native dynasty. Other client\r\nprincipalities met a like fate. Among the soldiery discipline was restored\r\nby disbanding four of the mutinous Rhine legions and replacing them with\r\nnew units. The praetorian guard, dissolved by Vitellius, was reconstituted\r\nout of Italian cohorts following the precedent set by Augustus.\r\n\r\n*The finances.* The most serious problem was that of the finances, for the\r\nextravagance of the preceding emperors had left the government in a state\r\nof bankruptcy and the provinces financially exhausted. Vespasian estimated\r\nthat the sum of $2,000,000,000 was required to make the necessary outlays.\r\nTo obtain this amount it was necessary to impose new taxes and avoid all\r\nneedless expenditures. Yet he not only succeeded in making the state\r\nsolvent but was able to carry out extensive building operations in Italy\r\nand in the provinces. In Rome the Capitoline Temple which had been burned\r\nin the fighting with the Vitellians was rebuilt, a temple of Peace was\r\nerected on the forum, and the huge Colosseum arose on the site of one of\r\nthe lakes of Nero’s Golden House. Vespasian also granted state support to\r\nthe teachers of Greek and Roman oratory in Rome.\r\n\r\nIn 74 A. D. Vespasian assumed the censorship and took a census of the\r\nempire in addition to filling the ranks of the Senate which had been\r\ndepleted by the late civil wars. He was generous in his grants of\r\ncitizenship to provincials, and bestowed the Latin right on all the\r\nnon-Roman communities of Spain, as a preliminary step to their complete\r\nromanization.\r\n\r\n*Vespasian and the senate.* Vespasian was the first princeps who was not\r\nof the Roman nobility. He was a native of the Italian municipality of\r\nReate and his family was only of equestrian rank. He was furthermore an\r\neminently practical man who made no attempt to disguise the fact that he\r\nwas the real master in the state. Significant in this respect was his\r\nrevival of the _praenomen_ imperator, which had been neglected by the\r\nsuccessors of Augustus. He treated the Senate with respect, and recognized\r\nits judicial authority, but excluded it from all effective share in the\r\ngovernment. A senatorial decree and a law of the _comitia_ conferred upon\r\nVespasian the powers of the principate, yet he dated the beginning of his\r\nreign from the day of his salutation as Imperator by his army. All these\r\nthings, combined with his refusal to punish the informers of Nero’s reign,\r\nearned him the ill-will of the senators. Some of them proceeded to open\r\ncriticism of the princeps and a futile advocacy of republicanism in the\r\nform of a cult of Brutus and Cato the Younger. The leader of this group\r\nwas Helvidius Priscus, son-in-law of Paetus Thrasea, whom Nero had put to\r\ndeath, and like him a Stoic. Although not very dangerous, such opposition\r\ncould not be ignored and Priscus was banished. He was later executed,\r\nprobably for conspiracy. In all probability it was the antimonarchical\r\ntendency of contemporary Stoic teachings that induced Vespasian to banish\r\nphilosophers from Rome.\r\n\r\n*The praetorian prefecture.* To forestall any disloyalty in the praetorian\r\nguard, Vespasian made his son Titus praetorian prefect. Titus also\r\nreceived the _imperium_ and _tribunicia potestas_, and when Vespasian died\r\nin 79 A. D. succeeded to the principate.\r\n\r\n*Titus, 79–81 A. D.* His rule lasted little over two years, and is chiefly\r\nremarkable for two great disasters. In 79 A. D. an eruption of the volcano\r\nof Vesuvius buried the cities of Pompeii, Herculaneum, and Stabii in\r\nCampania. Beneath the heavy deposit of volcanic ashes the buildings of\r\nthese towns have been preserved from disintegration, and the excavation of\r\nthe site of Pompeii has revealed with wonderful freshness the life of an\r\nItalian municipality under the principate. The following year Rome was\r\ndevastated by a fire which raged for three days and destroyed Vespasian’s\r\nnew temple of Capitoline Jupiter. In September, 81 A. D., Titus died,\r\ndeeply mourned by the whole Roman world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        VII. DOMITIAN, 81–96 A. D.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Character and policy.* Titus was followed by his younger brother\r\nDomitian, whom, on account of his ambition, neither Vespasian nor Titus\r\nhad permitted to share in the government. Domitian was a thorough autocrat\r\nand his administration was characterized by great vigor and capacity. Far\r\nfrom being a mere tyrant, he paid great attention to the welfare of the\r\nprovinces and exercised a strict supervision over his officers. He also\r\ndisplayed a real interest in literature and replaced the libraries\r\ndestroyed in the fire of 80 A. D.\r\n\r\nHis autocratic policy is clearly seen in his assumption of the censorship\r\nas perpetual censor in 84 A. D., whereby he acquired complete control over\r\nthe composition of the Senate, a power which, without the title, was\r\nhenceforth one of the prerogatives of the princeps. Even more emphatically\r\ndoes his absolutism come to light in the title _dominus__ et deus_ (Lord\r\nand God), which he required from the officers of his household, and by\r\nwhich he was generally designated, although he did not employ it himself\r\nin official documents. For the cult of the deified emperors Domitian\r\nerected a special temple in Rome, and he also established a priestly\r\ncollege of Flaviales, modelled on the Augustales of Rome, to perpetuate\r\nthe worship of his deified father and brother.\r\n\r\n*Frontier policy: Britain.* The desire for military successes as a support\r\nfor his absolutism led Domitian to adopt an aggressive frontier policy. In\r\nBritain, Julius Agricola, legate from 77 to 84 A. D., led the Roman\r\nlegions north of the Clyde and Firth of Forth and defeated the united\r\nCaledonians under their chief Galgacus (84 A. D.). He also sent his fleet\r\naround the north of Scotland and proved that Great Britain was an island.\r\nBut his projects, which included an invasion of Ireland, seemed too costly\r\nto Domitian who recalled him, possibly in view of the military situation\r\non the continent. The conquest of Scotland was not completed and the Roman\r\nauthority was confined to the territory south of the Tyne.\r\n\r\n*Germany.* In 83 A. D. Domitian led an army across the Rhine from Mainz\r\nand annexed the district of Wetterau, where the lowlands were already in\r\nRoman hands although the hills were still occupied by the hostile Chatti.\r\nA chain of forts was built to protect the conquered region. In the winter\r\nof 88–89 A. D. the legate of Upper Germany, Antonius Saturninus, was\r\nhailed as Imperator by the two legions stationed at Mainz. Aid was\r\nexpected by the mutineers from the German tribes, but this failed to\r\nmaterialize and the movement was suppressed by loyal troops, possibly from\r\nthe lower province. In consequence of this mutiny Domitian adopted the\r\npolicy of not quartering more than one legion in any permanent camp. At\r\nthe same time he separated the financial administration of the German\r\nprovinces from that of Gallia Belgica.\r\n\r\n*The lower Danube.* More powerful neighbors faced the Romans along the\r\nmiddle and lower Danube, and in dealing with these the policy of Domitian\r\nwas less successful. These people were the Germanic tribes of the\r\nMarcomanni and Quadi in Bohemia, the Sarmatian Iazyges between the Danube\r\nand the Theiss, and the Dacians, who occupied the greater portion of\r\nmodern Hungary and Roumania. The most powerful of all were the Dacians,\r\namong whom a king named Decebalus had built up a strong state. In 85 A. D.\r\nthey crossed the Danube into Moesia, where they defeated and killed the\r\nRoman governor. Thereupon Domitian himself took command and drove the\r\nDacians back across the river. But the pretorian prefect Cornelius Fuscus\r\nin attempting to invade Dacia suffered a disastrous defeat in which he and\r\nmost of his army perished. His successor Tettius Julianus was more\r\nsuccessful. However, a complete victory was prevented by Domitian, who\r\nrashly invaded the territory of the Marcomanni and Iazyges, and was\r\ndefeated by them. He thereupon made peace with Decebalus, who gave up his\r\nprisoners of war and acknowledged the formal overlordship of Rome, but\r\nreceived an annual subsidy from Domitian in addition to the services of\r\nRoman military engineers (89 A. D.). Although Domitian celebrated a\r\ntriumph for his exploits, his victory was by no means certain and his\r\nsettlement was only temporary. In the course of the Dacian war Moesia was\r\ndivided into two provinces.\r\n\r\n*Conflict with the Senate.* Feeling that the army was the surest support\r\nof his power, Domitian sought to secure its fidelity by increasing the pay\r\nof the soldiers by one third. This new expense, added to the outlays\r\nnecessitated by his wars, the construction of public works, like the\r\nrestoration of the Capitoline Temple, and the celebration of public\r\nfestivals, forced him to augment the taxes and this produced discontent in\r\nthe provinces. In Rome, particularly after the revolt of Saturninus, his\r\nrelations with the Senate became more and more strained. Many prominent\r\nsenators were executed on charges of treason; the teachers of philosophy\r\nwere again banished from Italy; and notable converts to Judaism or\r\nChristianity were prosecuted, the latter on the ground of atheism. The\r\ngeneral feeling of insecurity produced the inevitable result; a plot in\r\nwhich the praetorian prefects and his wife Domitia were concerned was\r\nformed against his life; he was assassinated, 18 September, 96 A. D. His\r\nmemory was cursed by the Senate and his name erased from public monuments.\r\nIt was the oppression of the last years of Domitian’s rule that so\r\nstrongly biased the attitude of Tacitus towards the principate and its\r\nfounder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n\r\n                  FROM NERVA TO DIOCLETIAN: 96–285 A. D.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    I. NERVA AND TRAJAN, 96–117 A. D.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Nerva and the Senate.* Before assassinating Domitian, the conspirators\r\nhad secured a successor who would be supported by the Senate and not prove\r\ninacceptable to the pretorians. Their choice was the elderly senator\r\nMarcus Cocceius Nerva, one of a family distinguished for its juristic\r\nattainments. He took an oath never to put a senator to death, recalled the\r\nphilosophers and political exiles, and permitted the prosecution of\r\ninformers. But he was lacking in force and did not feel his position\r\nsufficiently secure to refuse the demands of the praetorian guard for\r\nvengeance upon the murderers of Domitian. Therefore to strengthen his\r\nauthority he adopted a tried soldier, Marcus Ulpius Traianus, the legate\r\nof Upper Germany. Trajan received the tribunician authority and\r\nproconsular _imperium_ (97 A. D.).\r\n\r\n*The alimenta.* Nerva’s administration benefitted Italy in particular. Not\r\nonly were the taxes and other obligations of the Italians lessened, but\r\nthe so-called alimentary system was devised in the interests of poor\r\nfarmers and the children of poor parents. Under this system of state\r\ncharity, sums of money were lent to poor landholders at low rates of\r\ninterest on the security of their land. The interest from these loans was\r\npaid over to their respective municipalities and expended by them in\r\nsupporting the pauper children. The scheme was perfected and extended by\r\nthe succeeding princes.\r\n\r\n*An era of internal peace.* With Nerva begins a period in the history of\r\nthe principate that is characterized by amicable relations between the\r\nprinceps and the Senate. The basis of this concord was the agreement by\r\nthe successive emperors to acknowledge the freedom of senators from the\r\nimperial jurisdiction. There was no longer any question of an active\r\nparticipation by the Senate as a whole in the administration, nevertheless\r\nit continued to exercise its influence through the official posts reserved\r\nfor senators. In addition to the establishment of these harmonious\r\nrelations, the peaceful succession of a number of able rulers who were\r\ndesignated by adoption and association in the powers of the principate has\r\ncaused this epoch to be regarded as one of the happiest periods of Roman\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nNerva died in January, 98 A. D., after a rule of less than two years, and\r\nwas succeeded by Trajan, who assumed office at Cologne.\r\n\r\n*Trajan’s character and policy.* Trajan was a native of the Roman colony\r\nof Italica in Spain, and the first provincial to attain the principate.\r\nHis accession is evidence not only for the degree of romanization in the\r\nSpanish provinces but also for the decline of the dominance of the\r\nstrictly Italian element within the empire and the transformation of the\r\nItalian into an imperial nobility of wealth and office. The new princeps\r\nwas above all things a soldier, and the desire for military glory was his\r\nchief weakness. At the same time he was an energetic and conscientious\r\nadministrator, and showed a personal interest in the welfare of Italy and\r\nthe provinces, as we see from his correspondence with the younger Pliny,\r\ngovernor of Bithynia in 111–113 A. D. He respected the rights of the\r\nSenate and repeated Nerva’s oath not to condemn one of that body to death.\r\n\r\n*The **conquest** of Dacia, 101–106 A. D.* In the third year of his rule\r\nTrajan undertook the conquest of Dacia, for Domitian’s agreement with\r\nDecebalus was regarded as a disgrace and the existence of a strong Dacian\r\nkingdom was a perpetual menace to the Danubian frontier. Decebalus was\r\nstill king of the Dacians and proved himself a valiant opponent, but in\r\ntwo well-conducted campaigns (101–102 A. D.) Trajan forced him to sue for\r\npeace. He was obliged to give up his engines of war with the Roman\r\nengineers whom he had received from Domitian, to acknowledge Roman\r\noverlordship and render military service to Rome. Trajan built a permanent\r\nstone bridge across the Danube below the Iron Gates to secure\r\ncommunication with the northern bank, and returned to Rome to celebrate\r\nhis victory with a triumph. But Decebalus was not content to remain as a\r\nRoman vassal and made preparations to recover his people’s independence.\r\nIn 105 A. D. he opened hostilities by an invasion of Moesia. However,\r\nTrajan hurried to the scene, secured the support of the neighboring\r\ntribes, and in the following year entered Dacia. His victory was complete,\r\nthe capital of Decebalus was captured, the king took his own life, and\r\nsuch of the Dacians as did not abandon their country were hunted down and\r\nexterminated. Dacia was made a Roman province, and was peopled with\r\nsettlers from various parts of the empire, particularly from Asia Minor.\r\nThe new province was of importance both on account of its gold mines and\r\nits position as a bulwark defending the provinces to the south of the\r\nDanube. To commemorate his Dacian wars, Trajan erected a stone column, one\r\nhundred feet high, in the new forum which bore his name. The column, which\r\nis still in place, is adorned with a spiral band of sculptured reliefs\r\nthat vividly trace the course of the military operations.\r\n\r\nOn other frontiers also Trajan strengthened or extended the boundaries of\r\nthe empire. In 106 he annexed the kingdom of the Nabataean Arabs to the\r\neast of Palestine and Syria. From this was formed the province of Arabia.\r\nIn Africa also the Romans occupied new territory, and secured it against\r\nBerber raids by creating new fortresses at Lambaesis and Timgad.\r\n\r\n*The Parthian war, 114–116 A. D.* The peaceful relations which had existed\r\nbetween Rome and Parthia since the time of Nero were broken in 114 A. D.\r\nwhen the Parthian king Chosroes drove out the Armenian ruler, who had\r\nreceived his crown from Trajan’s hands, and set his own son Parthamasiris\r\nin his stead. Trajan at once repaired to the East and concentrated an army\r\nfor the invasion of Armenia. Parthamasiris offered to acknowledge the\r\nRoman suzerainty over Armenia, but Trajan determined to effect a definite\r\nsettlement of the eastern frontier by the permanent occupation of Armenia\r\nand, for strategic reasons, of Mesopotamia also. In 114 he effected an\r\neasy conquest of Armenia, and in the next year annexed Upper Mesopotamia.\r\nHe now resolved to complete his success by the overthrow of the Parthian\r\nkingdom. Accordingly, in 116 A. D., he overran Assyria and made it a\r\nprovince, and then pressed on to the Persian gulf, capturing Seleucia,\r\nBabylon and the Parthian capital Ctesiphon on his way. From dreams of\r\nfurther conquests Trajan was recalled by a serious revolt in Mesopotamia\r\nwhich was only subdued with great effort, and in 117 A. D. Chosroes was\r\nable to reoccupy his capital. At the same time the eastern provinces were\r\ndisturbed by a rising of the Jews, which began in Cyrene in 115 A. D. and\r\nspread to Cyprus, Egypt and Mesopotamia. Horrible massacres were\r\nperpetrated both by the Jews and their enemies, and large numbers of\r\ntroops had to be employed before order was restored.\r\n\r\nNews of revolts in Africa and Britain, and of troubles on the Danubian\r\nborder, led Trajan to set out for Rome. On the way he fell ill and died at\r\nSelinus in Cilicia on 8 August, 117 A. D.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        II. HADRIAN, 117–138 A. D.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Hadrian princeps.* Trajan left no male heir and had associated no one\r\nwith himself in the _imperium_ or tribunician power. However, on his\r\ndeathbed he adopted his cousin and one-time ward, Publius Aelius\r\nHadrianus, also a native of Italica. Hadrian was married to Sabina, a\r\ngrand-daughter of Trajan’s sister Marciana. He had had a distinguished\r\nmilitary career and in 117 A. D. was commander of the army in Syria. At\r\nthe news of his adoption his troops saluted him as Imperator and his\r\nnomination was confirmed by the Senate. The only opposition came from some\r\nof the ablest of Trajan’s officers, notably Lusius Quietus, who soon\r\nplotted against his life. But their conspiracy was detected and the Senate\r\ncondemned to death the four leaders in the plot.\r\n\r\n*Hellenism.* Hadrian was a man of restless energy and extraordinary\r\nversatility. He had a keen appreciation of all forms of art and\r\nliterature, and a great admiration for Hellenism; an admiration which\r\nprobably arose from a realization of the fact that the culture of the\r\nRoman empire was in its foundations Hellenic, but which caused him to be\r\nscornfully dubbed a “Greekling” by the Roman aristocracy.\r\n\r\n*General character of Hadrian’s government.* In public life he displayed\r\nthe greatest devotion to duty, in the belief that “the ruler exists for\r\nthe state, not the state for the ruler,” and there was no branch of the\r\npublic administration that was not affected by his zeal. Two extended\r\ntours, one in 121–126 and the other in 129–132 A. D., made him acquainted\r\nwith conditions in the provinces and enabled him to take measures to\r\npromote their welfare. The Senate he treated with all outward marks of\r\nrespect, taking the oath to respect the lives of its members, but at the\r\nsame time he regarded it as a negligible factor in the government.\r\n\r\n*Military policy.* Realizing that Trajan’s policy of imperial expansion\r\nhad overtaxed the economic resources of the empire, he began his rule by\r\nabandoning the new provinces of Mesopotamia and Assyria, and reverting to\r\nthe previous Roman policy in Armenia, where a Parthian prince acknowledged\r\nhis overlordship. He devoted his energies to strengthening the system of\r\nfrontier defences and raising the standards of discipline and efficiency\r\namong the soldiers. Aside from the suppression of the revolts which had\r\nbroken out in the last years of Trajan’s rule, his most serious military\r\nundertaking was the quelling of a new rising of the Jews in Palestine,\r\nwhich followed the foundation of a Roman colony on the site of Jerusalem.\r\nOnly after a two years’ struggle (132–134 A. D.) was the rebellion\r\ncrushed.\r\n\r\n*Judicial and administrative reforms.* To aid him in the administration of\r\njustice, Hadrian formed a permanent council of eminent jurists. He, too,\r\nwas responsible for codifying and editing in a final form the praetor’s\r\nedict, upon which was based the procedure of the Roman civil law. This\r\ntask was carried out by the jurist Salvius Julianus. With the object of\r\nrelieving the city courts of an excessive burden of judicial business,\r\nHadrian divided Italy into four districts, and appointed an official of\r\nconsular rank to administer justice in each. This was a further step in\r\nremoving Italy from the control of the Senate and approximating its status\r\nto that of a province. Hadrian’s administrative reforms were the result of\r\nthe steady increase in the sphere of public business carried on by the\r\nofficers of the princeps, and furthered the development of a centralized\r\nbureaucracy. By creating new offices—among them the post of advocate of\r\nthe fiscus (_advocatus fisci_) as an alternative for the subaltern\r\nmilitary offices—he greatly increased the importance of the equestrian\r\ncareer and the influence of the _equites_ in the government. In the three\r\ndepartments of the military, civil and judicial administration the\r\nprincipate of Hadrian marks a distinct epoch.\r\n\r\n*Building activity.* Everywhere throughout the empire Hadrian built and\r\nrepaired with the greatest zeal; but particularly in Rome and Athens. In\r\nRome, among other structures, he built the great double temple of Venus\r\nand Roma and his own mausoleum, the present Castel Sant’ Angelo. At Athens\r\nhe completed the great temple of Olympian Zeus, begun by Pisistratus in\r\nthe sixth century B. C., and added a new quarter to the city.\r\n\r\n*The choice of a successor.* In 136 A. D., Hadrian fell seriously ill and,\r\nhaving no children, adopted Lucius Ceionius Commodus under the name of\r\nLucius Aelius Caesar, and clothed him with the tribunician authority.\r\nHadrian himself withdrew from Rome to his splendid villa at Tibur.\r\nHowever, Aelius died at the beginning of 138 A. D., and thereupon the\r\nprinceps adopted an elderly senator named Titus Aurelius Antoninus, who in\r\nturn adopted the son of the deceased Aelius and his own nephew, Marcus\r\nAnnius Verus. Antoninus received the _imperium_ and tribunician power and\r\nbecame the partner of Hadrian in the principate. After a long and painful\r\nillness the latter died in July, 138 A. D. His later years were clouded by\r\nill health which rendered him moody and suspicious, and probably led to\r\nthe execution of his brother-in-law and the latter’s grandson on a charge\r\nof conspiracy. He had never been popular with the Senate and this step\r\nwidened the breach between them. Only the energetic action of his\r\nsuccessor prevented the execration of his memory and secured his\r\ndeification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    III. THE ANTONINES, 138–192 A. D.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Antoninus Pius, 138–161 A. D.* Antoninus, who received the name of Pius\r\nin the first year of his rule, was the personification of ancient Roman\r\npiety, i. e. the dutiful performance of obligations in public and private\r\nlife. His mildness and uprightness enabled him to act in perfect harmony\r\nwith the senators, and as a concession to them he removed the four\r\n_consulares juridici_ whom Hadrian had appointed in Italy.\r\n\r\n*His public policy.* Antoninus adhered to Hadrian’s peaceful foreign\r\npolicy, but had to wage several border wars and suppress some\r\ninsurrections in the provinces. In Britain a line of fortifications was\r\nconstructed from the Firth of Forth to the Clyde. Antoninus laid great\r\nemphasis upon an upright administration of justice. At this time, too, the\r\nRoman law was greatly enriched through the introduction of principles of\r\nequity and began to receive at the hands of the jurists the systematic\r\nform by which it was later characterized. In 147 A. D. he conferred the\r\ntitle of Caesar upon the elder of his adopted sons, Marcus Aurelius, whom\r\nhe had previously married to his daughter, and took him as an associate in\r\nthe government. Upon the death of Antoninus in March, 161 A. D., Aurelius\r\nsucceeded to the principate.\r\n\r\n*The dual principate—Marcus Aurelius, 161–180 A. D., and Lucius Verus,\r\n161–169.* Marcus Aurelius at once took as associate in the principate his\r\nadoptive brother, Lucius Verus, and for the first time two Augusti shared\r\nthe _imperium_. But the real power rested in the hands of Aurelius, for\r\nVerus was a weak character, indolent and sensual. Although he did not take\r\nthe oath not to put a senator to death, and restored the _consulares\r\niuridici_ removed by Antoninus, the elder Augustus respected the Senate\r\nand remained on good terms with it. Marcus Aurelius was by nature a\r\nstudent and philosopher, a devoted follower of the Stoic rule of life; his\r\n_Meditations_ bear testimony to the true nobility of his character. Such\r\nwas the princeps who was fated to spend his remaining years in an\r\nunceasing struggle against the enemies of the state and, true to his\r\nprinciples, he obeyed the call of duty and devoted himself unsparingly to\r\nthe public service.\r\n\r\n*Parthian war: 161–65 A. D.* Even before the death of Antoninus, Vologases\r\nIII of Parthia had begun hostilities and had overrun Armenia. The Roman\r\nlegate of Cappadocia was defeated and the Parthians broke into Syria,\r\nwhere they won another victory. The situation was critical. Aurelius sent\r\nhis colleague Verus to the scene, and although the latter displayed\r\nneither energy nor capacity, his able generals restored the fortunes of\r\nthe Roman arms. In 163 Statius Priscus reëstablished Roman authority over\r\nArmenia and placed a Roman vassal on the throne. In 164–65, Avidius\r\nCassius invaded Mesopotamia and took the Parthian capitals Seleucia and\r\nCtesiphon. Yet, on the march back, he suffered considerable losses from\r\nhunger and disease, and a peace was made with Parthia which gave the\r\nRomans territory in upper Mesopotamia to the east of the Euphrates (166\r\nA. D.). But the returning troops brought with them a plague which ravaged\r\nthe whole empire and caused widespread depopulation.\r\n\r\n*Wars with the Marcomanni, Quadi and Iazyges: 167–175 A. D.* In the\r\nmeantime a dangerous situation had arisen on the Danubian frontier, where,\r\nprobably in consequence of the pressure of migratory peoples, the\r\nMarcomanni, Quadi and the Sarmatian Iazyges united in an attempt to force\r\ntheir way into the Roman provinces. The army of the Danube had been\r\nweakened to reinforce the Syrian troops in the Parthian war and this\r\nenabled the barbarians to penetrate the frontier defences and ravage\r\nNoricum and Pannonia as far as Aquileia at the head of the Adriatic. The\r\ntwo Augusti proceeded to the scene of war, and after a protracted struggle\r\nin which Dacia suffered from a hostile invasion, the enemy were forced to\r\nmake peace. The Marcomanni submitted in 172, and the Quadi and Sarmatians\r\nin 175 A. D. They were forced to surrender the prisoners carried off from\r\nthe Roman provinces, over 160,000 in number, and to furnish military aid\r\nto Rome, while large numbers of them were settled on waste lands south of\r\nthe Danube under the obligation of tilling the soil and rendering military\r\nservice. The Roman victory was commemorated by the erection of a column at\r\nRome with sculptures picturing incidents of the war, in imitation of\r\nTrajan’s memorial. In addition to the prosecution of this war, the\r\nstrength of the empire had been taxed by serious outbreaks in Mauretania,\r\nGaul and Egypt.\r\n\r\n*Revolt of Avidius Cassius, 175 A. D.* The complete subjugation of the\r\nnorthern foe was hindered by the revolt of Avidius Cassius, the general\r\nwho had distinguished himself in the Parthian war and had suppressed the\r\nrevolt in Egypt. Verus, the colleague of Aurelius, had died in 169, and at\r\na rumor of the death of Aurelius himself in 175 A. D., Cassius proclaimed\r\nhimself Imperator in Syria. Thereupon Aurelius hastened to conclude peace\r\nwith the Sarmatians and proceeded to the East. Upon his arrival he found\r\nthat Cassius had been killed by his own soldiers. Soon afterwards\r\nCommodus, the son of Aurelius, received the title Augustus and became\r\nco-ruler with his father (177 A. D.).\r\n\r\n*Second war with the Marcomanni and Quadi, 177–180 A. D.* In 177 A. D. war\r\nbroke out anew with the Quadi and Marcomanni. Aurelius again took command\r\non the Danube and after two years’ fighting had won so complete a victory\r\nthat he contemplated the annexation of the region occupied by these\r\npeoples. But for a second time he was robbed of the fruits of his toil, on\r\nthis occasion by the hand of death, 17 March, 180 A. D. The principate\r\npassed to his son and colleague, Commodus.\r\n\r\n*Lucius Aurelius Commodus, **sole princeps**, 180–192 A. D.* Lucius\r\nAurelius Commodus, the ignoble son of a noble father, is one of the few in\r\nthe long line of Roman rulers of whom nothing good can be said. Cowardly,\r\ncruel and sensual, he gave himself up to a life of pleasure and left the\r\nconduct of the government in the hands of a succession of favorites, who\r\nused their power to further their own interests. He abandoned the war with\r\nthe Marcomanni and Quadi without carrying out his father’s plans and\r\ngranted them peace on lenient terms so that he might return to the\r\nenjoyments of the capital. His chief ambition was to win fame as a\r\ngladiator. He frequently appeared in the arena, and finally determined to\r\nassume the consulate on 1 January, 193 A. D. in a gladiator’s costume.\r\nHowever, on the preceding night he was assassinated at the instigation of\r\nthe pretorian prefect, Quintus Aemilius Laetus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             IV. THE SECOND WAR OF THE LEGIONS, 193–197 A. D.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Pertinax: January–March, 193 A. D.* The new princeps (Publius Helvius\r\nPertinax, a senator of low birth but proved military capacity) was the\r\nnominee of Laetus. However, his strictness in enforcing discipline among\r\nthe troops and his economies, necessitated by the exhausted condition of\r\nthe public finances, soon alienated the goodwill of the praetorians and\r\nLaetus himself. After less than three months’ rule he was killed in a\r\nmutiny of the pretorian guard (March, 193 A. D.).\r\n\r\n*Didius Julianus.* Their choice for a successor was an old and wealthy\r\nsenator, Didius Julianus, who purchased his nomination by the promise of a\r\nhigh donative. But his rule was destined to be short for, as in 68 A. D.,\r\nthe armies on the frontiers asserted their claim to appoint the princeps.\r\n\r\n*The **rivals**: Severus, Niger and Albinus.* Almost simultaneously three\r\ncommanders were saluted as Imperator by their soldiers. These were\r\nPescennius Niger in Syria, Clodius Albinus in Britain, and Septimius\r\nSeverus in Upper Pannonia. With their nominations a second war of the\r\nlegions began. Severus had the advantage of position and immediately\r\nmarched on Rome as the avenger of Pertinax. He also was able to arrange a\r\ntruce with Albinus by promising to recognize him as his successor with the\r\ntitle of Caesar. The praetorians offered no resistance to the Danubian\r\narmy; Julianus was deposed by the Senate and put to death (June, 193\r\nA. D.); and the Senate ratified the nomination of Severus.\r\n\r\n*Defeat of Niger and Albinus.* But the position of Severus was not yet\r\nsecure, for Niger had been recognized in the eastern provinces and also\r\nhad a strong following in Rome. He was preparing to march upon Italy and\r\nhad already occupied Byzantium. Severus at once set out to anticipate his\r\nattack. After investing Byzantium he crossed over to Asia Minor and\r\ndefeated the forces of his rival near Cyzicus and Nicaea, forcing them to\r\nwithdraw south of the Taurus mountains. The Cilician Gates were forced and\r\nNiger decisively beaten in a battle at Issus (194 A. D.). He tried to\r\nescape into Parthia but was overtaken and killed. Severus advanced across\r\nthe Euphrates to punish the Parthian king for his support of Niger. He\r\noccupied northern Mesopotamia, and made Nisibis a Roman colony and\r\nfrontier fortress (196 A. D.). In the same year Byzantium was taken, its\r\nfortifications destroyed, and its inhabitants deprived of the right of\r\nmunicipal organization. Severus had brought his Parthian campaign to a\r\nhasty conclusion, for in the West Clodius Albinus, feeling his position\r\ninsecure, had assumed the title of Augustus and occupied Gaul. Severus now\r\nelevated his eldest son Bassianus, better known as Caracalla, to the\r\nposition of Caesar with the additional title of _imperator designatus_,\r\nand set out to meet the usurper. In a great battle at Lugdunum, in which\r\n150,000 men are said to have fought on either side, the army of Severus\r\nwas victorious and Albinus fell by his own hand (197 A. D.). Many of his\r\nadherents, including numerous senators, were put to death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               V. THE DYNASTY OF THE SEVERI, 197–235 A. D.\r\n\r\n\r\n*The Parthian war of 197–199 A. D.* Severus was now unchallenged ruler of\r\nthe empire. Shortly after the defeat of Albinus, he returned to the East\r\nand resumed hostilities against the Parthians, whose king, Vologases IV,\r\nhad taken advantage of his absence to invade Armenia and Mesopotamia and\r\nwas besieging Nisibis. Severus relieved the beleaguered town and pressed\r\non into the enemy’s territory, where he sacked the two Parthian capitals,\r\nSeleucia and Ctesiphon, in 198 A. D. By a peace arranged in the next year\r\nnorthern Mesopotamia was ceded to Rome and was organized as a province\r\nunder a governor of equestrian rank.\r\n\r\n*A **military monarchy**.* Septimius Severus was a native of Leptis in\r\nAfrica. He came from an equestrian family and had begun his official\r\ncareer as an advocate of the _fiscus_. To secure the prestige of noble\r\nlineage he caused himself to be proclaimed as the adopted son of Marcus\r\nAurelius, and took the latter’s family name of Antoninus for himself and\r\nhis house. His rule was frankly autocratic in character and he made no\r\nattempt to disguise the fact that his authority rested upon the support of\r\nthe soldiery. Light is thrown upon Severus’ policy in general by the\r\nsignificant fact that under him Rome, which he adorned with magnificent\r\nstructures, received the title _sacra_ (sacred), a term regularly used to\r\ndesignate things under the control of the princeps. The activity of the\r\nSenate was limited to registering its approval of his measures, and\r\nequestrians were appointed to military posts hitherto filled only by\r\nsenators. The special privileges which Italy and the Italians had\r\ncontinued to enjoy were equally disregarded. The title proconsul, which\r\nTrajan and his successors had used in the provinces, was now employed by\r\nSeverus in Italy. In 193 he disbanded the old praetorian guard, which had\r\nbeen recruited from Italy and the more thoroughly latinized provinces, and\r\norganized a new corps of picked troops drawn from the legions in general,\r\nbut especially those of the Danubian army. Severus enrolled three new\r\nlegions for the Parthian war and placed them under the command of\r\nequestrian prefects instead of senatorial legates. Two of these legions\r\nwere stationed in Mesopotamia, but the third was quartered at the Alban\r\nMount in Latium. This step had the effect of reducing Italy to the status\r\nof a garrisoned province, but it was probably taken with the view of\r\nproviding a larger reserve force to supplement the frontier garrisons.\r\nSeverus also was the author of many reforms which improved the conditions\r\nor increased the rewards of military service. The pay of the troops was\r\nraised, the legionaries were allowed to contract a legal marriage when in\r\nservice, and the equestrian career was opened to veteran centurians.\r\nHowever, there seems to be no proof that Severus deliberately fostered the\r\nbarbarization of the army by the exclusion of Italian centurians, or that\r\nhe ruined the discipline of the soldiers by permitting the married\r\nlegionaries to reside outside of barracks. To rescue the government from\r\nthe state of insolvency into which it had been brought by his\r\npredecessors, Severus stood in need of a large sum of money. This he\r\nsecured by confiscating the estates of the adherents of Niger and Albinus.\r\n\r\nOf signal importance was the increase in the power of the praetorian\r\nprefecture at this time. This office was for a number of years held by a\r\nsingle prefect, Publius Fulvius Plautianus, whose daughter was married to\r\nthe eldest son of Severus. However, his great power proved his undoing,\r\nand in 205 A. D. he was executed on a charge of treason made by his own\r\nson-in-law. At his death two prefects were again appointed, one of whom\r\nwas Papinian, the greatest of all Roman jurists. His appointment seems to\r\nindicate a division between the military and the civil functions of the\r\nprefecture. For from this time the prefect exercised supreme jurisdiction\r\nover criminal cases in Italy beyond the hundredth milestone from the city,\r\nand in the matter of appeals from the judgments of provincial governors.\r\nIn the absence of the princeps he also presided over the imperial judicial\r\ncouncil. Following Papinian other eminent jurists filled this office.\r\nFurthermore, the supervision of the transportation of grain to Rome was\r\ntransferred from the prefect of the grain supply to the praetorian\r\nprefect, and the former officer merely supervised its distribution within\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\n*War in Britain, 208–211 A. D.* Like Hadrian, Severus paid great attention\r\nto strengthening the frontier defences of the empire, particularly the\r\nfortifications which linked the Rhine and the Danube. In 208 A. D. when\r\nBritain was invaded by the Caledonians, he took the field, accompanied by\r\nhis two sons. He reinforced Hadrian’s earthen wall between the Tyne and\r\nthe Solway by a wall of stone, and carried on guerilla warfare against the\r\ntribes of the northern part of the island. However, they had not been\r\ncompletely pacified when he died at York in February, 211 A. D., leaving\r\nthe principate to his sons, Caracalla and Geta, both of whom had\r\npreviously received the title of Augustus.\r\n\r\n*Caracalla, 211–217 A. D.* The bitter enmity which had long existed\r\nbetween the two brothers continued during a year of joint rule, and\r\ndivided the empire into rival factions. Then Caracalla, who had previously\r\nsought to make himself sole ruler, succeeded in having Geta assassinated.\r\nMany of the latter’s friends, among them the prefect Papinian, were\r\nexecuted. Caracalla was cruel and vicious, and displayed no capacity for\r\ngoverning. He relied solely upon the goodwill of the soldiery and courted\r\ntheir support by increased pay and lavish donatives. In 212 A. D., by the\r\nfamous Antonian Constitution (_constitutio Antoniniana_) he extended Roman\r\ncitizenship to all the provincials of the empire, except those who were in\r\na condition of vassalage, such as some of the barbarian peoples who had\r\nbeen settled on waste lands within the Roman borders, and not citizens of\r\norganized municipalities (_dediticii_). This act was the logical\r\nculmination of the policy of his predecessors who had granted citizenship\r\nto many provincial municipalities and had sanctioned its automatic\r\nextension to soldiers of the legions and auxiliary corps. Perhaps\r\nCaracalla’s chief motive was to supply a fresh source of income for the\r\ntreasury, which was sadly depleted by his extravagances, for he greatly\r\nincreased the number of those liable to the five per cent inheritance tax\r\nwhich fell only upon Roman citizens. A second motive may well have been\r\nthe desire to secure a uniformity of legal status and of municipal\r\norganization throughout the empire.\r\n\r\n*Germanic and Parthian wars.* In 213 A. D. an attack of a confederacy of\r\nGerman tribes, the Alamanni, upon the Raetian frontier was successfully\r\nrepelled, and in the next year Caracalla set out for the East, where he\r\nplanned to conduct a Parthian war in imitation of the conquests of his\r\nidol, Alexander the Great. In 215, the Parthian king, Vologases V, came to\r\nterms, but when he was dethroned by his brother, Artabanos V, who refused\r\nCaracalla’s request for the hand of his daughter, Caracalla prepared to\r\ninvade Parthian territory. But before he embarked on his venture he was\r\nassassinated by the order of the praetorian prefect Marcus Opellius\r\nMacrinus, April, 217 A. D.\r\n\r\n*Macrinus, 217–218 A. D.* Macrinus was recognized without opposition as\r\nCaracalla’s successor, and bestowed upon his young son Diadumenianus the\r\ntitle of Caesar. He was the first princeps who had not attained senatorial\r\nrank. As a ruler he displayed moderation and good sense, but was lacking\r\nin force. He purchased peace from the Parthians, abolished oppressive\r\ntaxes, and sought to lessen the military burden by cancelling the\r\nincreases of pay which Caracalla had granted to the troops. This latter\r\nstep cost him the support of the soldiery, and part of the Syrian army\r\ndeclared its allegiance to the fourteen-year-old Bassianus, a great-nephew\r\nof Julia Domna, the Syrian wife of Septimius Severus. Bassianus could\r\nclaim to be a representative of the house of Severus, and consequently was\r\nhailed as Imperator under the name of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus. However,\r\nhe is better known as Elagabalus, for he was by hereditary right the\r\npriest of the Sun God worshipped under that name at Emesa.\r\n\r\nMacrinus tried to suppress the revolt, but he was defeated near Antioch,\r\nand he and his son were captured and killed (June, 218 A. D.).\r\n\r\n*Elagabalus, 218–222 A. D.* Thereupon Elagabalus was universally\r\nrecognized as princeps and entered Rome in the following year. There he\r\nintroduced the worship of the sun as the supreme deity of the Roman world,\r\nand added to the imperial title that of “most exalted priest of the\r\nUnconquered Sun God Elagabalus.” His rule was a riot of debauch, in which\r\nhis associates were worthless favorites, whom he appointed to the highest\r\noffices. His grandmother, Julia Maesa, really conducted the government\r\nand, realizing his unfitness to rule, forced him to adopt his cousin\r\nSeverus Alexander with the title of Caesar in 221 A. D. When Elagabalus\r\nsought to rid himself of his relative the praetorians forced him to make\r\nAlexander his colleague, and finally murdered him (March, 222 A. D.).\r\n\r\n*Severus Alexander, 222–235 A. D.* Marcus Aurelius Severus Alexander was\r\nnow sole ruler. However, since he was a mere youth, his mother, Julia\r\nMamaea, daughter of Julia Maesa, exercised the powers of a regent. As he\r\ngrew up Alexander showed himself well-meaning and conscientious, but\r\nlacking in self-reliance, and he never emancipated himself from his\r\nmother’s tutelage. During his rule the Senate enjoyed a temporary revival\r\nof influence. Two councils of senators, one of sixteen and one of seventy\r\nmembers, acted as an imperial cabinet and an advisory legislative council,\r\nrespectively. At this time, too, the praetorian prefecture became a\r\nsenatorial office in that it conferred senatorial rank upon its holder. An\r\nattempt was made to remedy public abuses, in particular to restore\r\ndiscipline among the troops, and to reduce the military expenditure. But\r\nthe army had gotten out of hand, especially the praetorians, from whose\r\nanger Alexander was unable to protect the noted jurist Paul, who held the\r\npraetorian prefecture.\r\n\r\n*The new Persian empire.* The widespread military insubordination was all\r\nthe more dangerous since new and more aggressive foes began to threaten\r\nthe integrity of the empire. In 227 A. D. the Parthian dynasty of the\r\nArsacids was overthrown by the Persian Ardaschir (Artaxerxes) who founded\r\nthe dynasty of the Sassanids. The establishment of this new Persian\r\nkingdom was accompanied by a revival of the national Persian religion,\r\nZoroastrianism, and of the Persian claims to the eastern Roman provinces.\r\nIn 231 the Persians drove the Roman troops out of Mesopotamia and\r\npenetrated Cappadocia and Syria. Alexander himself then went to the East,\r\nwhere he took the offensive in the following year. The details of his\r\ncampaign are uncertain, but at any rate Mesopotamia was recovered and\r\nAlexander celebrated a triumph over the Persians in Rome (233 A. D.).\r\n\r\n*The Germanic campaign and death of Severus Alexander.* But the northern\r\nfrontier was threatened by the attacks of Germanic tribes, and in 234\r\nAlexander assumed the conduct of operations on the Rhine, with his\r\nheadquarters at Mainz. The barbarians were induced to make peace, but only\r\nby the payment of subsidies, and this cost Alexander the respect of the\r\narmy, who were disgruntled at his policy of retrenchment and his\r\nsubservience to his mother. A mutiny broke out, led by Gaius Julius Verus\r\nMaximinus, a Thracian of peasant origin who had risen from the ranks to\r\nhigh command. Alexander and Julia Mamaea were put to death, and Maximinus\r\nwas proclaimed Augustus (March, 235 A. D.). With his accession began a\r\nhalf century of confusion and anarchy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     VI. THE DISSOLUTION AND RESTORATION OF THE EMPIRE: 235–285 A. D.\r\n\r\n\r\n*The end of the pax Romana.* The period of fifty years from 235 to 285\r\nA. D. is a prolonged repetition of the shorter epochs of civil war of\r\n68–69 and 193–197 A. D. During this interval twenty-six Augusti, including\r\nsuch as were colleagues in the _imperium_, obtained recognition in Rome\r\nand of these only one escaped a violent death. In addition, there were\r\nnumerous usurpers or “tyrants,” as candidates who failed to make good\r\ntheir claims to the principate were called. Almost all of these emperors\r\nwere the nominees of the soldiery, and at least possessed military\r\nqualifications that were above the average. In general they\r\nconscientiously devoted themselves to the task of restoring order in the\r\nempire, but their efforts were in the main nullified by the treachery of\r\ntheir own troops and the rise of rival emperors.\r\n\r\n*The mutiny of the army.* The main cause of this disorganization lay in\r\nthe fact that the professional army had lost all sense of loyalty to the\r\nempire, an attitude already frequently evidenced by the praetorians, and\r\nby the legions also under Caracalla and his successors. Recruited, as the\r\nlatter now were, almost entirely from the frontiers of the Roman world,\r\nthey felt no community of interest with the inhabitants of the peaceful\r\nprovinces and turned upon them, like unfaithful sheep dogs upon the flocks\r\nwhom it was their duty to guard. The sole object of the troops was to\r\nenrich themselves by plunder and the extortion of high pay and frequent\r\nlargesses from the emperor whom they supported. Hence, in the expectation\r\nof fresh rewards, each army hailed as Imperator the commander who had led\r\nit to victory over foreign foes or revolting soldiers of Rome.\r\n\r\n*Barbarian invasions.* In addition to constant civil war, the Roman world\r\nwas exposed to all the horrors of barbarian invasions. We have already\r\nnoticed the rise of a new Persian state whose object was the\r\nreëstablishment of the empire as it had existed prior to the conquests of\r\nAlexander the Great. Likewise on the whole extent of the northern frontier\r\nnew and more aggressive peoples assaulted and penetrated the frontier\r\ndefences. On the North Sea coast, between the Rhine and the Weser were the\r\nSaxons whose ships raided the shores of Britain and Gaul. Facing the\r\nRomans along the lower Rhine were the Franks, along the upper Rhine the\r\nAlamanni, further east on the upper Danube the Marcomanni, while on the\r\neastern frontier of Dacia and to the north of the Black Sea were situated\r\nthe Goths and the Heruli. The withdrawal of troops from some sectors of\r\nthe frontier to meet attacks at others and the neglect of their duty by\r\nthe army corps who plunged into the maelstrom of civil war in support of\r\nvarious candidates for the imperial power gave the northern barbarians the\r\nopportunity to sweep down in destructive hordes upon the peaceful and\r\nundefended provinces.\r\n\r\n*Dissolution of the empire.* The natural consequence of the failure of the\r\nimperial government to defend the provinces from hostile invasions was\r\nthat the provincials began to take measures for their own protection and\r\nto transfer their allegiance from the Roman emperors to local authorities,\r\nwho proved a more efficient help in time of trouble. These separatist\r\ntendencies were active both in the East and in the West and led to a\r\ntemporary dissolution of the unity of the Empire.\r\n\r\n*Pestilence.* A third scourge which afflicted the Roman world at this\r\ncritical period was a pestilence which, originating in the East, entered\r\nthe Empire about 252 A. D., and raged for fifteen years.\r\n\r\n*Valerian and Gallienus: 253–268 A. D.* The fortunes of the Empire reached\r\ntheir lowest ebb under Valerian and his son Gallienus (253–268 A. D.). In\r\n256, the Persians invaded Mesopotamia and Syria, and captured Antioch.\r\nValerian at once undertook the defence of the eastern provinces, leaving\r\nGallienus in charge of the West. Antioch was recovered, but when Valerian\r\nentered Mesopotamia to relieve the blockade of Edessa, he was defeated by\r\nthe Persian king Sapor, and taken prisoner (258 A. D.). He died soon\r\nafterwards in captivity. The Persians not only reoccupied Antioch but also\r\nseized Tarsus in Cilicia and Caesarea in Cappadocia, and ravaged Asia\r\nMinor to the shores of the Aegean Sea.\r\n\r\nWhile Valerian was waging his ill-fated war in the East, the rest of the\r\nempire was in a continual state of turmoil. In 257 the Goths and other\r\npeoples overran Dacia, crossed the Danube and penetrated as far south as\r\nMacedonia and Achaia. In 258 a revolt broke out in Mauretania. The Berber\r\ntribesmen, led by an able chief, Faraxen, invaded the province of Numidia,\r\nand were only reduced to submission by the capture of their leader (260\r\nA. D.). At the same time the Alamanni broke into Raetia, and made their\r\nway over the Alps into the Po valley. Gallienus hastened to the rescue and\r\ndefeated them near Milan. But in his absence in Italy the Franks crossed\r\nthe Rhine and poured in devastating hordes over Gaul and Spain. The Roman\r\npossessions on the right bank of the Rhine were lost at this time and\r\nnever recovered.\r\n\r\n*The empire of the Gauls.* At the news of the death of Valerian the\r\ncommander in Pannonia, Ingenuus, raised the standard of revolt. After\r\ndefeating him, Gallienus found another serious rival in Regalianus, whom,\r\nhowever, he was likewise able to overcome. But at the same time (258\r\nA. D.), Marcus Cassius Latinius Postumus, whom Gallienus had left in\r\ncommand in Gaul, assumed the imperial title, after a victory gained over a\r\nbody of Franks. He was able to clear Gaul of its foes and make himself\r\nmaster of Britain and Spain. Gallienus was powerless to depose him.\r\nPostumus did not endeavor to establish a national Gallic state but\r\nregarded himself as exercising the Roman _imperium_ in a portion of the\r\nempire. He fixed his capital at Trèves, and organized a senate and other\r\ninstitutions on the Roman model. His coins bore the inscription _Roma\r\nAeterna_.\r\n\r\n*Palmyra.* In the Orient the Persians were unable to retain their hold on\r\nSyria and Asia Minor. Their withdrawal was in large measure caused by the\r\nactivities of Odaenathus, the ruler of the city of Palmyra, who inflicted\r\na severe defeat upon Sapor and recovered Roman Mesopotamia. Thereupon two\r\nbrothers, Fulvius Macrianus and Fulvius Quietus, sons of an officer who\r\nhad distinguished himself against the Persians, were acclaimed as emperors\r\nin Asia Minor. However, the one was defeated in attempting to invade\r\nEurope and the other was overthrown by Odaenathus. In recognition of his\r\nservices Gallienus bestowed upon him the title of “Commander of the East”\r\n(_dux orientis_), with the duty of protecting the East (264 A. D.). In\r\nPalmyra, he ruled as _basileus_, or king, and although he nominally\r\nacknowledged the overlordship of the Roman emperor, he was practically an\r\nindependent sovereign.\r\n\r\n*The Goths.* A fresh peril arose in the maritime raids of the Goths,\r\nHeruli, and other tribes who had seized the harbors on the north coast of\r\nthe Black Sea. With the ships that they thus secured they ravaged the\r\nnorthern coast of Asia Minor as early as 256 A. D. In 262 they forced the\r\npassage of the Bosphorus and Hellespont and plundered the shores of the\r\nAegean. Their most noted raid was in 267, when they sacked the chief\r\ncities of Greece, including Athens.\r\n\r\nNo less than eighteen usurpers, for the most part officers who had risen\r\nfrom the ranks, had unsuccessfully challenged the authority of Gallienus\r\nin the various provinces. At last, in 268 A. D., one of his leading\r\ngenerals, Aureolus, laid claim to the imperial title. Gallienus defeated\r\nhim and was besieging him in Milan, when he was killed at the instigation\r\nof his officers, who proclaimed as his successor one of their own number,\r\nMarcus Aurelius Claudius.\r\n\r\n*Claudius Gothicus, 268–270 A. D.* The rule of Claudius lasted only two\r\nyears, in which his greatest achievement was the crushing defeat which he\r\ninflicted upon the Goths who had again overrun Greece and the adjacent\r\nlands (269 A. D.). This victory won him the name of Gothicus. Upon the\r\ndeath of Claudius in 270 A. D., the army chose Lucius Domitius Aurelianus\r\nas emperor.\r\n\r\n*Lucius Domitius Aurelianus, 270–275 A. D.* Aurelian’s first task was to\r\nclear Italy and the Danubian provinces of barbarian invaders. Two\r\nincursions of the Alamanni into Raetia and Italy were repulsed, the latter\r\nwith great slaughter. But the emperor recognized that the security of\r\nItaly could no longer be guaranteed and so he ordered the fortification of\r\nthe Italian cities. The imposing wall which still marks the boundary of\r\npart of ancient Rome was begun by Aurelian. A horde of Vandals were beaten\r\nand driven out of Pannonia and a victory was won over the Goths in Moesia.\r\nBut the exposed position of Dacia, and the fact that it was already in\r\nlarge part occupied by the barbarians, induced Aurelian to abandon it\r\naltogether. The rest of the Roman settlers were withdrawn to Moesia, where\r\na new province of Dacia was formed behind the barrier of the Danube.\r\n\r\n*The overthrow of Palmyra.* Aurelian was now ready to attempt his second\r\nand greater task, the restoration of imperial unity. And in this the East\r\nfirst claimed his attention. There Vaballathus, the son of Odaenathus,\r\nruled over Palmyra, supported and directed by his mother, Zenobia. At the\r\noutset Aurelian had recognized his position but in 271 Vaballathus assumed\r\nthe title of Augustus and thereby declared his independence of Roman\r\nsuzerainty. He was able to extend his authority over Egypt and a great\r\npart of Asia Minor. In 272 Aurelian set out to bring back the East to its\r\nallegiance. He speedily recovered Asia Minor, and entered Syria, where he\r\nsignally defeated the famous Palmyrene archers and mailed horsemen at\r\nEmesa. He then crossed the desert and laid siege to Palmyra itself.\r\nZenobia tried to escape, but was taken, and the city surrendered. The\r\nqueen and her family were carried off to Rome but Palmyra was at first\r\nspared. However, it rebelled again when Aurelian had set out for Rome.\r\nThereupon the emperor returned with all speed and recaptured the city.\r\nThis time it was utterly destroyed. The authority of Rome was once more\r\nfirmly reëstablished in the East.\r\n\r\n*The reconquest of Gaul.* Following his conquest of Palmyra, Aurelian\r\nproceeded to overthrow the already tottering empire of the Gauls. At the\r\ndeath of Postumus in 268, Spain and Narbonese Gaul had acknowledged the\r\nRoman emperor Claudius Gothicus. After several successors of Postumus had\r\nbeen overthrown by the mutinous Gallic soldiery, Publius Esuvius Tetricus\r\nwas appointed emperor in Gaul and Britain. However, foreseeing the speedy\r\ndissolution of his empire, he secretly entered into negotiations with\r\nAurelian. The latter invaded Gaul and met the Gallic army at the plain of\r\nChalons. In the course of the battle, Tetricus went over to Aurelian, who\r\nwon a complete victory. Britain and Gaul submitted to the conqueror (274\r\nA. D.). Thus the unity of the empire was restored and Aurelian assumed the\r\ntitle of “Restorer of the World” (_restitutor orbis_).\r\n\r\n*Dominus et deus natus.* Not only was Aurelian one of the greatest of\r\nRoman commanders; he also displayed sound judgment in his administration.\r\nHere his chief work was the suppression of the debased silver currency and\r\nthe issuing of a much improved coinage. Aurelian regarded himself as an\r\nabsolute monarch and employed on his coins the titles _dominus et deus\r\nnatus_—“born Lord and God.” He likewise reëstablished in Rome the official\r\ncult of the Unconquered Sun God, previously introduced by Elagabalus. One\r\nof the characteristics of this cult was the belief that the monarch was\r\nthe incarnation of the divine spirit, a belief which gave a moral\r\njustification to absolutism.\r\n\r\n*Probus, 276–282 A. D.* Aurelian was murdered in 275 A. D., and was\r\nsucceeded by Tacitus, who met a like fate after a rule of less than two\r\nyears. He was followed by Marcus Aurelius Probus, an able Illyrian\r\nofficer. Probus was called upon to repel fresh invasions of Germanic\r\npeoples, to subdue the rebellious Isaurians in Asia Minor and suppress a\r\nrevolt in Egypt. Everywhere he successfully upheld the authority of the\r\nempire, but his strict discipline eventually cost him the favor of the\r\nsoldiers who hailed as Imperator Marcus Aurelius Carus. Probus was put to\r\ndeath (282 A. D.). Like his predecessor, Carus was a general of great\r\nability. He appointed his eldest son Carinus Augustus as his co-ruler, and\r\nleft him in charge of the West while he embarked on a campaign against the\r\nPersians. This was crowned with complete success and terminated with the\r\ncapture of Ctesiphon. But on his return march he died, probably at the\r\nhands of his troops (283 A. D.). His younger son, the Caesar Numerianus,\r\nwho took command of the army, was assassinated by the praetorian prefect\r\nAper. However, the choice of the army fell upon Gaius Valerius Aurelius\r\nDiocletianus, who assumed the imperial title in September, 284 A. D. But\r\nCarinus had retained his hold upon the West and advanced to crush\r\nDiocletian. In the course of a battle at the river Margus in Moesia he was\r\nmurdered by his own officers (285 A. D.), and with the victory of\r\nDiocletian a new period of Roman history begins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n\r\n              THE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION UNDER THE PRINCIPATE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       I. THE VICTORY OF AUTOCRACY\r\n\r\n\r\n*The senate and the appointment of the princeps.* In the preceding\r\nchapters we have traced in outline the political history of the principate\r\nto the point where it had become an undisguised military autocracy. This\r\nchange is clearly seen in connection with the imperial nomination. The\r\nappointment to the principate originally involved the conferment of the\r\n_imperium_, the tribunician power and other rights and privileges. The\r\n_imperium_ might be bestowed either by a senatorial decree or through the\r\nacclamation as _imperator_ by a part of the soldiery. Each of these forms\r\nwas regarded as valid, but was regularly confirmed by the other. But the\r\ntribunician authority and the remaining powers of the princeps were\r\nconferred only by a decree of the Senate, confirmed, during the first\r\ncentury at least, by a vote of the Assembly of the Centuries. However,\r\nafter the accession of Carus (282 A. D.), the Senate, which could no\r\nlonger claim to exercise any authority in the state, ceased to participate\r\nin the appointment of the new ruler. This marks the formal end of the\r\nprincipate.\r\n\r\n*The Senate’s loss of administrative power. I. Rome and Italy.* The\r\nconstitutional history of the principate is the story of the gradual\r\nabsorption of the Senate’s powers by the princeps and the supplanting of\r\nthe Senate’s officers by those in the imperial service. It has been well\r\nsaid that Augustus aimed at the impossible when he sought to be the chief\r\nmagistrate in the state without being at the same time the head of the\r\nadministration. He had intended that the Senate should conduct the\r\nadministration of Rome, Italy and the ungarrisoned provinces, but, as we\r\nhave seen, he himself had been brought by force of circumstances to take\r\nthe initial steps in infringing upon the Senate’s prerogatives. Not only\r\ndid he take over the duties of provisioning and policing the city by\r\nestablishing the prefectures of the grain supply and the watch, but he\r\nalso assumed responsibility for the upkeep of the public buildings,\r\nstreets and aqueducts of Rome, as well as the highways of Italy. These\r\ndepartments of public works were put in charge of commissioners of\r\nsenatorial rank, called curators, whom the princeps nominated. However,\r\nfrom the time of Claudius equestrian officials, entitled procurators, were\r\nappointed to these departments and became their real directors. Finally,\r\nunder Septimius Severus, the senatorial curators were dispensed with.\r\n\r\n*II. The aerarium.* Augustus had left to the Senate the control of the\r\npublic treasury, the _aerarium_, which was maintained by revenues from the\r\nsenatorial provinces and Italy. But when the princeps came to assume\r\ncontrol of those branches of the administration the expense of which was\r\ndefrayed by the _aerarium_, it was inevitable that the treasury itself\r\nshould pass in some degree under his supervision. And so in 44 A. D. the\r\nprinceps began to designate two quaestors to be in charge of the treasury\r\nfor a three-year period. Under Nero the place of these quaestors was taken\r\nby two prefects appointed in the same manner but from among the\r\nex-praetors. The importance of the _aerarium_ declined in proportion as\r\nits revenues passed into the hands of the ministers of the princeps, until\r\nin the period between Septimius Severus and Diocletian it sank to the\r\nposition of a municipal chest for the city of Rome.\r\n\r\n*III. The senatorial provinces.* In the early principate the senatorial\r\nprovinces were administered by appointees of the Senate, all of whom now\r\nbore the title of proconsul, assisted as in former days by quaestors.\r\nHowever, only the proconsul of Africa was at the same time commander of a\r\nprovincial garrison, and his command was transferred to the imperial\r\ngovernor of Numidia by Caligula. Even in the time of Augustus the imperial\r\nprocurators had appeared in the senatorial provinces in charge of the\r\nrevenues which were at the disposal of the princeps, and, before the close\r\nof the third century they were in complete control of the financial\r\nadministration of these provinces. But long before this, by the opening of\r\nthe second century, the princeps had usurped the Senate’s privilege of\r\nappointing the proconsuls. The result was that by the close of the\r\nprincipate all the provinces without distinction were equally under\r\nimperial control.\r\n\r\n*Restriction of Senate’s elective powers.* It was Tiberius who transferred\r\nto the Senate the electoral functions of the Assembly but he, as Augustus\r\nbefore him, limited the Senate’s freedom of action by the recommendation\r\nof imperial candidates for the lower magistracies. From the time of Nero\r\nthe consulship also was regularly filled by nominees of the emperors. The\r\ncustom of appointing several successive consular pairs in the course of\r\neach year, each pair functioning for two or four months, greatly weakened\r\nthe influence of the consulate, while it enabled the emperors to gratify\r\nthe ambitions of a larger number of candidates for that office.\r\n\r\n*Loss of legislative functions.* The rapid disappearance of the Assembly\r\nresulted in the transfer of its sovereign legislative powers to the\r\nSenate. The decrees of the Senate thus acquired the validity of laws and\r\nafter the time of Nerva comitial legislation completely ceased. However,\r\nthe influence of the princeps encroached more and more upon the\r\nlegislative freedom of the Senate until in the time of the Severi the\r\nsenatorial decrees were merely proclamations of the princeps (_orationes\r\nprincipis_) which were read to the Senate and approved by it. Furthermore,\r\nthe princeps developed independent legislative power and by the middle of\r\nthe second century the ordinances or constitutions of the princeps had\r\nacquired the force of law. Early in the third century legislation of this\r\ntype altogether superseded the senatorial decrees. The imperial\r\nconstitutions included edicts, _decreta_, or judicial verdicts, responses\r\nto the petitions of officers of the princeps or private citizens, and\r\nmandates or instructions to his subordinates. Originally, the edicts were\r\nonly valid during the principate of their author and the other forms of\r\nconstitutions merely applied to special cases. However, in course of time,\r\nthey all alike came to be recognized as establishing rules of public and\r\nprivate law which remained in force unless they were specifically revoked\r\nby another imperial constitution.\r\n\r\n*The administration of justice.* The republican system of civil and\r\ncriminal jurisdiction was inherited by the principate, and the courts of\r\nthe praetors continued to function for Rome and Italy, while the\r\nproconsuls were in charge of the administration of justice in the\r\nsenatorial provinces. In addition the Senate, under the presidency of the\r\nconsuls, acted as a tribunal for the trial of political offences and\r\ncriminal charges brought against members of the senatorial order. The\r\nSenate also served as a court of appeals from the decisions of the\r\nproconsuls. But from the time of Augustus the princeps exercised an\r\nunlimited right of jurisdiction which enabled him to take cases under his\r\npersonal cognizance (_cognitio_), or appoint a delegate to try them. The\r\nimperial officials administered justice in their respective spheres by\r\nvirtue of delegated authority and consequently appeals from their courts\r\nwere directed to the princeps. The development of judicial functions by\r\nthe military and administrative officials of the princeps in Rome—the\r\npraetorian prefect, the city prefect, the prefects of the watch and the\r\nprefect of the grain supply—seriously encroached upon the judicial power\r\nof the praetors. In addition, the _consulares_ of Hadrian, and the\r\n_iuridici_ of Marcus Aurelius further limited the sphere of the praetorian\r\ncourts. Ultimately, under Septimius Severus, we find the city prefect as\r\nthe supreme judicial authority for all criminal cases arising in Rome or\r\nwithin a radius of one hundred miles of the city and also exercising\r\nappellate jurisdiction in civil cases within the same limits, subject\r\nhowever, to an appeal to the court of the princeps. For the rest of Italy,\r\nthe court of the praetorian prefect was now the highest tribunal in both\r\ncriminal and civil suits. By this time also the princeps had acquired\r\nsupreme appellate jurisdiction for the whole empire, a power which was\r\nregularly exercised by the praetorian prefect acting in his place, In the\r\nthird century the Senate ceased to exercise any judicial authority\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the above processes the princeps became in the end the sole\r\nsource of legislative, administrative and judicial authority. The\r\nrepublican magistrates had become practically municipal officers, and one\r\nof them, the aedileship, disappeared in the third century. The complete\r\nvictory of the princeps over the Senate is marked by the exclusion of\r\nsenators from military commands under Gallienus, and their removal from\r\nthe provincial governorships in which they had continued to exercise civil\r\nauthority between the time of Aurelian and the accession of Diocletian.\r\n\r\n*The friction between the Senate and the princeps.* It might be thought\r\nthat owing to the gradual admission to the Senate of the nominees of the\r\nprinceps that harmony would have been established between the two\r\nadministrative heads of the state. But although this new nobility was\r\nthoroughly loyal to the principate, they proved just as tenacious of the\r\nrights of the Senate as the descendants of the older nobility who\r\npreserved the tradition of senatorial rule. Augustus and Tiberius\r\nendeavored to govern in concord with the Senate by organizing an advisory\r\ncouncil appointed from the Senate, but their successors abandoned the\r\npractice. The friction between the princeps and the Senate was due in part\r\nto the realization that it was from the senatorial order that rivals might\r\narise and in part to the fact that those emperors who did not interpret\r\ntheir position, as did Augustus, in the light of a magistracy responsible\r\nto the Senate, were bound to regard the Senate’s powers as restrictions\r\nupon their own freedom of action, and as an unnecessary complication of\r\nthe administration. The chief services of the Senate were to provide a\r\nhead for the government when the principate was vacant, and to furnish the\r\nonly means for the expression of opinion with regard to the character of\r\nthe administration of the individual emperors. The spontaneous deification\r\nor the _damnatio memoriae_ of a deceased princeps was not without weight,\r\nfor it expressed the opinion of the most influential class in the state.\r\n\r\nWhile the Senate as a body was thus stripped of its power, the senatorial\r\norder remained a powerful class. Originally embracing the chief\r\nlandholders of Italy, it came to include those of the whole empire.\r\nCollectively the senators lost in influence, but individually they gained.\r\nBy the end of the second century the senatorial order had acquired an\r\nhereditary title, that of _clarissimus_ (most noble), indicative of their\r\nrank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   II. THE GROWTH OF THE CIVIL SERVICE\r\n\r\n\r\n*The first steps.* The necessary counterpart to the assumption of\r\nadministrative duties by the princeps was the development of an imperial\r\ncivil service, the officials of which were nominated by the princeps, and\r\npromoted or removed at his pleasure. In this Augustus had taken the first\r\nsteps by the establishment of equestrian procuratorships and prefectures,\r\nand the opening up of an equestrian career, but the number of these posts\r\ngreatly increased with the extension of the administrative sphere of the\r\nprinceps at the expense of the Senate. The idea of conducting the\r\ngovernment through various departments manned by permanent salaried\r\nofficials was absolutely foreign to the Roman republic, which only\r\nemployed such servants for clerical positions of minor importance in Rome.\r\nHowever, the chaotic conditions which had resulted from the republican\r\nsystem showed the need of a change, and the concentration of a large share\r\nof the administration in the hands of the princeps both required and gave\r\nthe opportunity for the development of an organized civil service. This\r\ndevelopment was unquestionably stimulated and influenced by the\r\nincorporation in the Roman empire of the kingdom of Egypt, which possessed\r\na highly organized bureaucratic system that continued to function\r\nunchanged in its essential characteristics.\r\n\r\n*The imperial secretaryships.* At first the imperial civil service lacked\r\nsystem and there was little or no connection between the various\r\nadministrative offices in Italy and in the provinces. Augustus and his\r\nimmediate successors conducted the administration as part of their private\r\nbusiness, keeping in touch with the imperial officials through the private\r\nsecretaries of their own households, that is to say, their freedmen, who,\r\nin another capacity, conducted the management of the private estate of the\r\nprinceps. An important change was introduced under Claudius, when his\r\ninfluential freedmen caused the creation within the imperial household of\r\na number of secretaryships with definite titles that indicated the sphere\r\nof their duties. The chief of these secretaryships were the _a\r\nrationibus_, the _ab epistulis_, the _a libellis_, the _a __cognitionibus_\r\nand the _a studiis._ The _a rationibus_ acted as a secretary of the\r\ntreasury, being in charge of the finances of the empire which were\r\ncontrolled by the princeps; the _ab epistulis_ was a secretary for\r\ncorrespondence, who prepared the orders which the princeps issued to his\r\nofficials and other persons; the _a libellis_ was a secretary for\r\npetitions, who received all requests addressed to the princeps; the _a\r\n__cognitionibus_ served as a secretary for the imperial inquests,\r\nentrusted with the duty of preparing the information necessary for the\r\nrendering of the imperial decision in the judicial investigations\r\npersonally conducted by the princeps (_cognitiones_); and the _a studiis_,\r\nor secretary of the records, had the duty of searching out precedents for\r\nthe guidance of the princeps in the conduct of judicial or administrative\r\nbusiness. The establishment of these secretaryships in the imperial\r\nhousehold tended to centralize more completely the imperial administration\r\nand to give it greater uniformity and regularity. At the same time the\r\ninfluence of the freedmen who occupied these important positions was\r\nresponsible for the admission of freedmen to many of the minor\r\nadministrative procuratorships. It was under Claudius also that the\r\npreliminary military career of the procurators was more definitely fixed.\r\n\r\n*The reforms of Hadrian and Septimius Severus.* Hadrian took the next\r\ndecisive step in the development of the central administrative offices\r\nwhen he transformed the secretaryships of the imperial household into\r\nsecretaryships of state by filling them with equestrians of procuratorial\r\nrank in place of imperial freedmen. From this time the latter were\r\nrestricted to minor positions in the various departments. Under Hadrian\r\nalso there was a marked increase in the number of administrative\r\nprocuratorships owing to the final abolition of the system of farming the\r\nrevenues and their subsequent direct collection by imperial officials as\r\nwell as the establishment of the public post as a means of intercourse\r\nthroughout all the provinces. It was possibly with the object of supplying\r\nthe necessary officials to undertake these new tasks that Hadrian created\r\nthe office of the advocate of the _fiscus_ as an alternative for the\r\npreliminary military career of the procurators.\r\n\r\nSeptimius Severus, as we have seen, opened the posts of the civil\r\nadministration to veteran officers upon the completion of a long period of\r\nmilitary service. Thus, although a purely civil career was established,\r\nwhich led ultimately to the highest prefectures, nevertheless, during the\r\nprincipate the civil administrative offices were never completely\r\nseparated from the traditional preliminary military service. It was\r\nSeptimius Severus also who made the praetorian prefect, as the\r\nrepresentative of the princeps, the head of the civil as well as of the\r\nmilitary administration.\r\n\r\n*The salary and titles of the equestrian officials.* The ordinary career\r\nof an official in the imperial civil service included a considerable\r\nnumber of procuratorships in various branches of the administration, both\r\nin Rome, Italy and the provinces. Although from the time of Augustus a\r\ndefinite salary was attached to each of these offices, it was not until\r\nafter the reforms of Hadrian that four distinct classes of procurators\r\nwere recognized on the basis of the relative importance of their offices\r\nexpressed in terms of pay. These four classes of procurators were the\r\n_tercenarii_, _ducenarii_, _centenarii_ and _sexagenarii_, who received\r\nrespectively an annual salary of 300,000, 200,000, 100,000 and 60,000\r\nsesterces; this classification remained unchanged until the close of the\r\nthird century. At that time the highest class included the imperial\r\nsecretaries of state, whose title was now that of _magister_, or master.\r\nThe salary of the four chief prefectures was probably higher still.\r\n\r\nFollowing the example of the senatorial order, the equestrians also\r\nacquired titles of honor, which depended upon their official rank. From\r\nthe time of Hadrian the title _vir eminentissimus_ (most eminent) was the\r\nprerogative of the praetorian prefects. Under Marcus Aurelius appear two\r\nother equestrian titles, _vir perfectissimus_ and _vir egregius_. In the\r\nthird century the latter was borne by all the imperial procurators, while\r\nthe former was reserved for the higher prefectures (apart from the\r\npraetorian), the chief officials of the treasury and the imperial\r\nsecretaries.\r\n\r\n*Administration of the finances: (I). The Fiscus.* The most important\r\nbranch of the civil administration was that of the public finances, which\r\nmerits special consideration. Augustus did not centralize the\r\nadministration of the provincial revenues which were at his disposal, but\r\ncreated a separate treasury or _fiscus_ for each imperial province.\r\nHowever, he did establish the _aerarium militare_ at Rome for the control\r\nof the revenues destined for the pensioning of veteran troops.\r\nFurthermore, Augustus drew a sharp distinction between the public revenues\r\nwhich were administered by the princeps in his magisterial capacity, and\r\nthe income from his own private property or patrimony. For the expenditure\r\nof the former he acknowledged a strict accountability to the Senate. The\r\npolicy of Augustus was followed by Tiberius and Caligula, but under\r\nClaudius a central _fiscus_ was organized at Rome for the administration\r\nof all the public revenues of the princeps. The provincial _fisci_\r\ndisappeared, and the military treasury became a department of the\r\n_fiscus_. This new imperial _fiscus_ was under the direction of the _a\r\nrationibus_. From this time the princeps ceased to hold himself\r\naccountable for the expenditure of the public imperial revenues, and the\r\n_fiscus_ assumes an independent position alongside of the old _aerarium_\r\nof the Roman people, which, as we have shown, it ultimately deprived of\r\nall share in the control of the public finances. However, the distinction\r\nbetween the public and private revenues of the princeps was still\r\nobserved, and the _patrimonium_ was independently administered by a\r\nspecial procurator.\r\n\r\n*(II). The Patrimonium.* But with the extinction of the Julio-Claudian\r\nhouse and the accession of Vespasian the patrimony of the Caesars passed\r\nas an appendage of the principate to the new ruler. It then became state\r\nproperty, and as it had grown to enormous size owing to the inheritances\r\nof Augustus and the confiscations of Caligula and Nero, the _patrimonium_\r\nwas organized as an independent branch of the imperial financial\r\nadministration. The personal estate of the princeps was henceforth\r\ndistinguished as the _patrimonium privatum_. This situation continued\r\nuntil the accession of Septimius Severus, whose enormous confiscations of\r\nthe property of the adherents of Niger and Albinus were incorporated in\r\nhis personal estate. This, the _patrimonium privatum_, was now placed\r\nunder a new department of the public administration called the _ratio_ or\r\n_res privata_. The old _patrimonium_ became a subordinate branch of the\r\n_fiscus_. The title of the secretary of the treasury in charge of the\r\n_fiscus_ was now changed to that of _rationalis_, while the new secretary\r\nin charge of the privy purse was called at first _procurator_, and later\r\n_magister_, _rei privatae_. The reform of Severus, which gave to the\r\nprivate income of the princeps a status in the administration comparable\r\nto that of the public revenues, is a further expression of the monarchical\r\ntendencies of his rule.\r\n\r\n*The officiales.* The subaltern personnel of the various bureaus, the\r\nclerks, accountants, etc., during the first two centuries of the\r\nprincipate was composed almost entirely of imperial freedmen and slaves.\r\nAmong these there was apparently no fixed order of promotion or uniform\r\nsystem of pay, nor could they ever advance to the higher ranks of the\r\nservice. However, from the time of Severus soldiers began to be employed\r\nin these capacities and a military organization was introduced into the\r\nbureaus. The way was thus gradually paved for completely dispensing with\r\nthe services of freedmen and slaves in any part of the civil\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              III. THE ARMY AND THE DEFENCE OF THE FRONTIERS\r\n\r\n\r\n*The barbarization of the army.* It will be recalled that the military\r\npolicy of Augustus aimed at securing the supremacy of the Roman element in\r\nthe empire by restricting admission to the legions to Roman citizens or to\r\nfreeborn inhabitants of provincial municipalities who received a grant of\r\ncitizenship upon entering the service. The gradual abandonment of this\r\npolicy is one of the most significant facts in the military history of the\r\nprincipate.\r\n\r\n*The territorial recruitment of the legions.* Under the Augustan system\r\nthe legions in the West were recruited from Italy and the romanized\r\nprovinces of the West, the eastern legions from the Greek East and\r\nGalatia. But the increasing reluctance of the Italians to render military\r\nservice led to the practical, although not to the theoretical, exemption\r\nof Italy from this burden which now rested more heavily upon the latinized\r\nprovinces. An innovation of utmost importance was the introduction of the\r\nprinciple of territorial recruitment for the legions by Hadrian.\r\nHenceforth these corps were recruited principally from the provinces in\r\nwhich they were stationed, and consequently freedom from the levy was\r\nextended to the ungarrisoned provinces, Baetica, Narbonese Gaul, Achaia\r\nand Asia. The effect of Hadrian’s reform is well illustrated by a\r\ncomparison of the various racial elements in the legions stationed in\r\nEgypt under the early principate with those in the same legions in the\r\ntime of Marcus Aurelius. The lists of the veterans discharged from these\r\nlegions under Augustus or Tiberius show that fifty per cent were recruited\r\nfrom Galatia, twenty-five per cent from the Greek municipalities in Egypt,\r\nfifteen per cent from Syria and the Greek East, and the remainder from the\r\nwestern provinces. A similar list from 168 A. D. shows sixty-five per cent\r\nfrom Egypt, the remainder from the Greek East, and none from Galatia or\r\nthe West. In general, the consequence of Hadrian’s policy was to displace\r\ngradually in the legions the more cultured element by the more warlike,\r\nbut less civilized, population from the frontiers of the provinces. It was\r\nHadrian also who opened the pretorian guard to provincials from Spain,\r\nNoricum and Macedonia. As we have seen, Severus recruited the pretorians\r\nfrom the legions and so deprived the more thoroughly latinized parts of\r\nthe empire of any real representation in the ranks of the army.\r\n\r\n*The auxiliaries.* The auxiliary corps, unlike the legions, were not\r\nraised by Augustus from Roman citizens but from the non-Roman provincials\r\nand allies. At first they were recruited and stationed in their native\r\nprovinces, but after the revolt of the Batavi in 68 A. D. they were\r\nregularly quartered along distant frontiers. From the time of Hadrian,\r\nthey were generally recruited, in the same manner as the legions, from the\r\ndistricts in which they were in garrison. The extension of Roman\r\ncitizenship to practically the whole Roman world by Caracalla in 212 A. D.\r\nremoved the basic distinction between the legions and the auxiliaries.\r\n\r\n*The numeri.* A new and completely barbarous element was introduced by\r\nHadrian into the Roman army by the organization of the so-called _numeri_,\r\ncorps of varying size, recruited from the non-Romanized peoples on the\r\nfrontiers, who retained their local language, weapons and methods of\r\nwarfare but were commanded by Roman prefects. The conquered German peoples\r\nsettled on Roman soil by Marcus Aurelius and his successors supplied\r\ncontingents of this sort.\r\n\r\n*The strength of the army.* At the death of Augustus the number of the\r\nlegions was twenty-five; under Vespasian it was thirty; and Severus\r\nincreased it to thirty-three, totalling over 180,000 men. A corresponding\r\nincrease had been made in the numbers of the auxiliaries. From about\r\n150,000 in the time of Augustus they had increased to about 220,000 in the\r\nsecond century. The total number of troops in the Roman service at the\r\nopening of the third century was therefore about 400,000; one of the\r\nlargest professional armies the world has ever seen.\r\n\r\n*The system of frontier defence.* A second momentous fact in the military\r\nhistory of the principate was the transformation of the army from a field\r\nforce into garrison troops. This was the result of the system developed\r\nfor the defence of the frontiers. Augustus, for the first time in the\r\nhistory of the Roman state endeavored to preclude the possibility of\r\nindefinite expansion by attaining a frontier protected by natural barriers\r\nbeyond which the Roman power should not be extended. Roughly speaking\r\nthese natural defences of the empire were the ocean on the west, the Rhine\r\nand the Danube on the north, and the desert on the east and south. At\r\nstrategic points behind this frontier Augustus stationed his troops in\r\nlarge fortified camps, in which both legionaries and auxiliaries were\r\nquartered. These camps served as bases of operations and from them\r\nmilitary roads were constructed to advantageous points on the frontier\r\nitself to permit the rapid movement of troops for offensive or defensive\r\npurposes. Such roads were called _limites_ or “boundary paths,” a name\r\nwhich subsequently was used in the sense of frontiers. These _limites_\r\nwere protected by small forts manned by auxiliary troops.\r\n\r\n*The fortification of the limites.* Although Claudius and Vespasian\r\ndiscarded the maxims of Augustus in favor of an aggressive border policy\r\nthey adhered to his system for protecting their new acquisitions in\r\nBritain and the Agri Decumates. However, these conquests and that of the\r\nWetterau region by Domitian pushed the frontier beyond the line of natural\r\ndefences and led to the attempt to construct an artificial barrier as a\r\nsubstitute. It was Domitian who took the initial step in this direction by\r\nfortifying the _limites_ between the Rhine and Main, and the Main and the\r\nNeckar, with a chain of small earthen forts connected by a line of wooden\r\nwatchtowers. To the rear of this advanced line there were placed larger\r\nstone forts, each garrisoned by a corps of auxiliaries, and connected by\r\nroads to the posts on the border. While the auxiliary troops were thus\r\ndistributed along the frontiers in small detachments, the larger legionary\r\ncantonments were broken up, and after 89 A. D. no camp regularly contained\r\nmore than a single legion. Trajan, who also waged his frontier wars\r\noffensively, merely improved the system of communication between the\r\nborder provinces by building military highways along the line of the\r\nfrontier from the Rhine to the Black Sea, in Arabia, and in Africa.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of frontier defence, as in so many other spheres, a new\r\nepoch begins with Hadrian. He reverted abruptly to the defensive policy of\r\nAugustus and began to fortify the _limites_ on a more elaborate scale. The\r\nfrontier between the Rhine and the Danube was protected by an unbroken\r\nline of ditch and palisade, in which stone forts, each large enough for an\r\nauxiliary cohort, took the place of the earthen forts of Domitian. At the\r\nsame time the _limes_ was shortened and straightened, and the secondary\r\nline of forts abandoned. In Britain a wall of turf was constructed from\r\nthe Tyne to the Solway, and in the Dobrudja a similar wall linked the\r\nDanube to the Black Sea. The eastern frontier of Dacia was likewise\r\ndefended by a line of fortifications. Here, as on the other borders, the\r\nRoman sphere of influence, and even of military occupation, extended\r\nbeyond the fortified _limes_.\r\n\r\nAntonius Pius followed Hadrian’s example and ran an earthen rampart with\r\nforts at intervals from the Forth to the Clyde in northern Britain. This\r\nline of defence was abandoned by Septimius Severus, who rebuilt Hadrian’s\r\nrampart in the form of a stone wall with small forts at intervals of a\r\nmile and intervening watch towers. In addition seventeen larger forts were\r\nconstructed along the line of the wall. The _limes_ in Germany was\r\nstrengthened by the addition of a ditch and earthen wall behind Hadrian’s\r\npalisade, but along the so-called Raetian _limes_, between the Danube and\r\nthe Main, another stone wall, 110 miles long, took the place of the\r\nearlier defences. A similar change was made in the fortifications of the\r\nDobrudja. However, this system was not followed out in the East or in\r\nAfrica, where the _limes_ was guarded merely by a chain of blockhouses.\r\n\r\n*The consequences of permanent fortifications.* The result of the\r\nconstruction of permanent fortifications along the frontier was the\r\ncomplete immobilization of the auxiliary corps. Stationed continuously as\r\nthey were for the most part in the same sectors from early in the second\r\ncentury, and recruited, in increasing proportion, from among the children\r\nof the camps, it only required the granting to them of frontier lands by\r\nSeverus Alexander, upon condition of their defending them, to complete\r\ntheir transformation into a border militia (_limitanei_). At the same time\r\nthe scattering of the legions along the line of the frontiers made the\r\nassembling of any adequate mobile force a matter of considerable time. And\r\nthe fortifications themselves, while useful in checking predatory raids by\r\nisolated bands and in regulating intercourse across the frontiers, proved\r\nincapable of preventing the invasion of larger forces. Consequently, when\r\nin the third century the barbarians broke through the _limites_ they found\r\nno forces capable of checking them until they had penetrated deeply into\r\nthe heart of the provinces.\r\n\r\nThe chaos which followed the death of Severus Alexander was the result of\r\na military policy which left the richest and most highly civilized parts\r\nof the empire without any means of self-defence; created a huge\r\nprofessional army the rank and file of which had come to lose all contact\r\nwith the ungarrisoned provinces, all interest in the maintenance of an\r\norderly government and all respect for civil authority; and at the same\r\ntime rendered the army itself incapable of performing the task for which\r\nit was organized.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand the army had been one of the most influential agents in\r\nthe spread of the material and cultural aspects of Roman civilization. The\r\ngreat highways of the empire, bridges, fortifications and numerous public\r\nworks of other sorts were constructed by the soldiers. Every camp was a\r\ncenter for the spread of the Latin language and Roman institutions and the\r\nnumber of Roman citizens was being augmented continuously by the stream of\r\ndischarged auxiliaries whose term of service had expired. In the\r\n_canabae_, or villages of the civilian hangers-on of the army corps,\r\nsprang up organized communities of Roman veterans with all the\r\ninstitutions and material advantages of municipal life. The constant\r\nmovement of troops from one quarter of the empire to another furnished a\r\nready medium for the exchange of cultural, in particular of religious,\r\nideas. To the ideal of the empire the army remained loyal throughout the\r\nprincipate, although this loyalty came at length to be interpreted in the\r\nlight of its own particular interests. Not only was the army the support\r\nof the power of the princeps; it was also the mainstay of the _pax Romana_\r\nwhich endured with two brief interruptions from the battle of Actium to\r\nthe death of Severus Alexander and was the necessary condition for the\r\ncivilizing mission of Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  IV. THE PROVINCES UNDER THE PRINCIPATE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is to the provinces that one must turn to win a true appreciation of\r\nthe beneficial aspects of Roman government during the principate. As\r\nMommsen(16) has said: “It is in the agricultural towns of Africa, in the\r\nhomes of the vine-dressers on the Moselle, in the flourishing townships of\r\nthe Lycian mountains, and on the margin of the Syrian desert that the work\r\nof the imperial period is to be sought and found.” In this sphere the\r\nchief tasks of the principate were the correction of the abuses of the\r\nrepublican administration and the extension of Graeco-Roman civilization\r\nover the barbarian provinces of the west and north. How well this latter\r\nwork was done is attested not merely by the material remains of once\r\nflourishing communities but also by the extent to which the civilization\r\nof Western Europe rests upon the basis of Roman culture.\r\n\r\n*Number of the provinces.* At the establishment of the principate there\r\nwere about thirteen provinces, at the death of Augustus twenty-eight, and\r\nunder Hadrian forty-five. In the course of the third century the latter\r\nnumber was considerably increased. The new provinces were formed partly by\r\nthe organization of newly conquered countries as separate administrative\r\ndistricts and partly by the subdivision of larger units. At times this\r\nsubdivision was made in order to relieve a governor of an excessively\r\nheavy task and to improve the administration, and at times it proceeded\r\nfrom a desire to lessen the dangers of a revolt of the army by breaking up\r\nthe larger military commands.\r\n\r\n*Senatorial and imperial provinces.* As we have seen the provinces were\r\ndivided into two classes, senatorial or public and imperial or Caesarian,\r\ncorresponding to the division of administrative authority between the\r\nSenate and the princeps. The general principle laid down by Augustus that\r\nthe garrisoned provinces should come under the authority of the princeps\r\nwas adhered to, and consequently certain provinces were at times taken\r\nover by the latter in view of military necessities while others were given\r\nup by him to the Senate. As a rule newly organized provinces were placed\r\nunder imperial governors, so that these soon came to outnumber the\r\nappointees of the Senate. Eventually, as has been observed in connection\r\nwith the history of the civil service, the public provinces passed\r\ncompletely into the hands of the princeps.\r\n\r\n*Administrative officials.* The governors of the senatorial provinces were\r\nentitled proconsuls, even if they were of pretorian rank. However, Asia\r\nand Africa were reserved for ex-consuls. Following the law of Pompey, a\r\nperiod of five years intervened between the holding of a magistracy and a\r\npromagisterial appointment. Each proconsul was assisted by a _quaestor_,\r\nand by three propraetorian _legati_ whose appointment was approved by the\r\nprinceps. The imperial governors were of two classes, _legati Augusti_ and\r\nprocurators. In the time of Hadrian there were eleven proconsuls,\r\ntwenty-four _legati Augusti_ and nine procurators, besides the prefect of\r\nEgypt. The subordinates of the _legati Augusti_ were the legates in\r\ncommand of the legions, and the fiscal procurators. The procuratorial\r\ngovernors, at first called prefects, were equestrians, and were placed in\r\ncommand of military districts of lesser importance which were garrisoned\r\nby auxiliaries only. An exception to this practice was made in the case of\r\nEgypt, which senators were forbidden to enter, and which was governed by a\r\nprefect who ranked next to the praetorian prefect and had under his orders\r\na garrison of three legions. These governmental procurators had, in\r\naddition to their military duties, the task of supervising financial\r\nadministration. The title _praeses_ (plural _praesides_) which was used in\r\nthe second century for the imperial governors of senatorial rank, came to\r\ndesignate the equestrian governors when these supplanted the _legati_ in\r\nthe latter half of the third century.\r\n\r\nAs under the republic, the governors exercised administrative, judicial,\r\nand, in the imperial provinces, military authority. However, with the\r\nadvent of the principate the government of the empire aimed to secure the\r\nwelfare and not the spoliation of its subjects, and hence a new era dawned\r\nfor the provinces. All the governors now received fixed salaries and thus\r\none of their chief temptations to abuse their power was removed.\r\nOppressive governors were still to be found, but they were readily brought\r\nto justice—the senatorial governors before the Senate and the imperial\r\nbefore the princeps—and condemnations, not acquittals, were the rule. It\r\nwas from the exactions of the imperial fiscal procurators rather than\r\nthose of the governors that the provinces suffered under the principate.\r\nAlthough the term of the senatorial governors, as before, was limited to\r\none year, tried imperial appointees were frequently kept at their posts\r\nfor a number of years in the interests of good government.\r\n\r\nIt has been mentioned before that under Augustus the taxation of the\r\nprovinces was revised to correspond more closely to their taxpaying\r\ncapacity. Under the principate these taxes were of two kinds, direct or\r\n_tributa_ and indirect or _vectigalia_. The _tributa_, consisted of a\r\npoll-tax (_tributum capitis_), payable by all who had not Roman or Latin\r\ncitizenship, and a land and property tax (_tributum soli_), from which\r\nonly communities whose land was granted the status of Italian soil (_ius\r\nItalicum_) were exempt. The chief indirect taxes were the customs dues\r\n(_portoria_), the five per cent tax on the value of emancipated slaves,\r\npossibly the one per cent tax on sales, and the five per cent inheritance\r\ntax which was levied on Roman citizens only. In the imperial provinces the\r\nland tax was a fixed proportion of the annual yield of the soil, whereas\r\nin the senatorial provinces it was a definite sum (_stipendium_) annually\r\nfixed for each community.\r\n\r\nThe principate did not break abruptly with the republican practice of\r\nemploying associations of _publicani_ in collecting the public revenues.\r\nIt is true that they had been excluded from Asia by Julius Caesar, and it\r\nis possible that Augustus dispensed with them for the raising of the\r\ndirect taxes in the imperial provinces, but even in the time of Tiberius\r\nthey seem to have been active in connection with the _tributa_ in some of\r\nthe senatorial provinces. Their place in the imperial provinces was taken\r\nby the procurator and his agents, in the senatorial at first by the\r\nproconsul assisted by the taxpaying communities themselves and later by\r\nimperial officials.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand the indirect taxes long continued to be raised\r\nexclusively by the corporations of tax collectors in all the provinces.\r\nHowever, the operations of these _publicani_ were strictly supervised by\r\nthe imperial procurators. In place of the previous custom of paying a\r\nfixed sum to the state in return for which they acquired a right to the\r\ntotal returns from the taxes in question, the _publicani_ now received a\r\nfixed percentage of the amount actually collected. Under Hadrian the\r\ncompanies of _publicani_ engaged in collecting the customs dues began to\r\nbe superseded by individual contractors (_conductores_), who like the\r\ncompanies received a definite proportion of the amount raised. About the\r\ntime of Commodus the system of direct collection by public officials was\r\nintroduced and the contractors gave way to imperial procurators. In the\r\nsame way, the five percent taxes on inheritances and manumissions were at\r\nfirst farmed out, but later (under Hadrian in the case of the former)\r\ncollected directly by agents of the state.\r\n\r\n*The municipalities.* Each province was an aggregate of communes\r\n(_civitates_), some of which were organized towns, while others were\r\ntribal or village communities. From the opening of the principate it\r\nbecame a fixed principle of imperial policy to convert the rural\r\ncommunities into organized municipalities, which would assume the burden\r\nof local administration. Under the Republic the provincial communities had\r\nbeen grouped into the three classes, free and federate (_liberae et\r\nfoederatae_), free and immune (_liberae et immunes_), and tributary\r\n(_stipendiariae_). In addition to these native communities there had begun\r\nto appear in the provinces Roman and Latin colonies. Towards the close of\r\nthe Republic and in the early principate the majority of the free\r\ncommunities lost their immunity from taxation and became tributary. Some\r\nof them exchanged the status of federate allies of Rome for that of Roman\r\ncolonies. During the same period the number of colonies of both types was\r\ngreatly increased by the founding of new settlements or the planting of\r\ncolonists in provincial towns. Some of the latter also acquired the status\r\nof Roman municipalities. Thus arose a great variety of provincial\r\ncommunities, which is well illustrated by conditions in the Spanish\r\nprovince of Baetica (Farther Spain) under Vespasian. At that time this\r\nprovince contained nine colonies and eight municipalities of Roman\r\ncitizens; twenty-nine Latin towns; six free, three federate, and one\r\nhundred and twenty tributary communities.\r\n\r\nWe have already mentioned the policy of transforming rural communities\r\ninto organized municipalities. How rapidly this transformation took place\r\nmay be gathered from the fact that in Tarraconesis (Hither Spain) the\r\nnumber of rural districts sunk from one hundred and fourteen to\r\ntwenty-seven between the time of Vespasian and that of Hadrian. A parallel\r\nmovement was the conversion of the native towns into Roman colonies and\r\nmunicipalities, often through the transitional stage of Latin communities,\r\na status that now existed in the provinces only. The acquirement of Roman\r\nor Latin status brought exemption from the poll-tax, while the former\r\nopened the way to all the civil and military offices of the empire. An\r\nadded advantage was won with the charter of a Roman colony, for this\r\nusually involved immunity from the land tax also. The last step in the\r\nRomanization of the provincial towns was Caracalla’s edict of 212 A. D.\r\nwhich conferred Roman citizenship upon all non-Roman municipalities\r\nthroughout the empire.\r\n\r\n*The three Gauls and Egypt.* From this municipalization of the provinces\r\ntwo districts were at first excluded on grounds of public policy. These\r\ndistricts were the three Gauls (Aquitania, Lugdunensis and Belgica) and\r\nEgypt. At the time of its conquest Gaul was a rich agricultural country,\r\nwith sharply defined tribal communities, but little or no city\r\ndevelopment. This condition Augustus judged well adapted, under strict\r\nimperial control, to furnishing recruits and supplies of money and kind\r\nfor the great army of the Rhine. Therefore he continued the division of\r\nGaul in tribal units (_civitates_), sixty-four in number, each controlled\r\nby its native nobility. His policy was in general adhered to for about two\r\nhundred years, but in the course of the third century the municipal system\r\nwas introduced by converting the chief town of each _civitas_ into a\r\nmunicipality with the rest of the _civitas_ as its _territorium_ or\r\ndistrict under its administrative control.\r\n\r\nIn Egypt Augustus by right of conquest was the heir of the Ptolemies and\r\nwas recognized by the Egyptians proper as “king of upper Egypt and king of\r\nlower Egypt, lord of the two lands, _autocrator_, son of the Sun.” For the\r\nGreek residents he was an absolute deified ruler of the Hellenistic type.\r\nThus Egypt, although a part of the Roman empire, was looked upon as\r\nsubject to the rule of the princeps alone. And, as in the theory of\r\ngovernment, so in the political institutions of the country the Romans\r\nadapted to their purposes existing conditions in place of introducing\r\nradical changes.\r\n\r\nIn the time of Augustus there were three Greek towns in Egypt, Alexandria\r\nthe capital, Ptolemais and Naucratis. To these Hadrian added a third,\r\nAntinoopolis. Ptolemais, Naucratis and Antinoopolis enjoyed municipal\r\ninstitutions, but Alexandria because of the turbulence of its population\r\nwas ruled by imperial officials following the Ptolemaic practice. The rest\r\nof the population of the country lived in villages throughout the Nile\r\nValley, which was divided for administrative purposes into thirty-six\r\ndistricts called nomes (_nomoi_). The bulk of the land of Egypt was\r\nimperial or public domain land, and the great majority of the Egyptian\r\npopulation were tenants on the imperial domain. For the collection of the\r\nland tax, poll tax, professional and other taxes, for the supervision of\r\nirrigation, and for the maintenance of the public records of the\r\ncultivated acreage and the population (for which a census was taken every\r\nfourteen years) there had been developed a highly organized bureaucracy\r\nwith central offices at Alexandria and agents in each of the nomes. This\r\nsystem of government was maintained by the Romans, and profoundly\r\ninfluenced the organization of the imperial civil service. At the head of\r\nthe administration of Egypt stood the prefect, an equestrian because of\r\nhis position as a personal employee of the princeps, and because the power\r\nconcentrated in his hands would have proved a dangerous temptation to a\r\nsenator. The chief burden laid upon Egypt was to supply one third of the\r\ngrain consumed at Rome, or about 5,000,000 bushels annually. This amount\r\nwas drawn partly from the land tax which was paid in kind and partly from\r\ngrain purchased by the government.\r\n\r\nThe first step towards spreading municipal government throughout all Egypt\r\nwas taken in 202 A. D., when Septimius Severus organized a _boule_, or\r\nsenate of the Greek type, in Alexandria and in the metropolis or seat of\r\nadministration of each nome. His object was to create in each metropolis a\r\nbody which could be made to assume definite responsibilities in connection\r\nwith the administration. However, it was not until after Diocletian that\r\nthese villages received a full municipal organization.\r\n\r\nThe principate’s greatest service to the provinces was the gift of two and\r\na half centuries of orderly government, which led in many quarters to a\r\nmaterial development unequalled in these regions before or since. It is in\r\nthese centuries that the history of Rome becomes the history of the\r\nprovinces. At the opening of the period the Italians occupied a privileged\r\nposition within the empire, at its close they and their one-time subjects\r\nwere on the same level. The army and the senatorial and equestrian orders\r\nhad been thoroughly provincialized, and the emperors had come to be as a\r\nrule of provincial birth. Rome was still the seat of the administration,\r\nbut this and the corn dole to the city proletariat were the only things\r\nthat distinguished it from a provincial city.\r\n\r\nThe imperial government of Rome had crushed out all vestiges of national\r\nloyalty among the peoples it had absorbed, and had failed to create any\r\npolitical institutions which would have permitted the provincials, as\r\nsuch, to have participated in the government of the empire. With the\r\ngradual decline of municipal autonomy the great mass of the provincials\r\nwere deprived of the last traces of an independent political life. The\r\nprovincial councils established for the maintenance of the imperial cult\r\ndid indeed occasionally voice the complaints of the provincials but never\r\nacquired active political powers. And that the Roman administration proved\r\na heavy burden is attested by the numerous complaints against the weight\r\nof taxation and the necessity which many emperors felt of remitting the\r\narrears of tribute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            V. MUNICIPAL LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Roman empire was at bottom an aggregate of locally self-governing\r\ncommunities, which served as units for conscription, taxation and\r\njurisdiction. They were held together by the army and the civil service,\r\nand were united by the bonds of a common Graeco-Roman civilization. These\r\nmunicipalities were of two general types, the Hellenic in the East and the\r\nLatin in the West.\r\n\r\nThe Hellenic municipalities were developments from the _poleis_, or\r\ncity-states, which existed prior to the Roman conquest in Greece and the\r\nHellenized areas of Asia and Africa. Municipal towns organized in these\r\nareas subsequent to the Roman occupation were of the same type. Their\r\nlanguage of government, as well as of general intercourse, was Greek. The\r\ncharacteristic political institutions of the Hellenic municipalities were\r\na popular assembly, a council or _boule_ and annual magistrates. The\r\nassembly had the power to initiate legislation; the council and\r\nmagistrates were elected by it or were chosen by lot. But even under the\r\nRoman republic these democratic institutions were considerably modified in\r\nthe interests of the wealthier classes. Timocratic constitutions were\r\nestablished with required property qualifications for citizenship and for\r\nthe council and offices. The principate saw a further development along\r\nthe same lines. The assemblies lost their right to initiate legislation, a\r\npower which passed to the magistrates, while the council tended to become\r\na body of ex-magistrates who held their seats for life. However, in spite\r\nof this approximation to the Latin type, the Greek official terminology\r\nremained unchanged throughout the first three centuries A. D.\r\n\r\nThe Latin type of municipality was that which developed on Italian soil\r\nwith the extension of Roman domination over the peninsula, and which was\r\ngiven uniformity by the legislation of Julius Caesar. With the\r\nRomanization of the western part of the empire it spread to Africa, Spain,\r\nGaul, Britain, Germany and the Danubian provinces. In spite of the\r\ndistinctions in status between Roman and Latin colonies and _municipia_,\r\nall these classes of municipalities were of the same general type which is\r\nrevealed to us in the Julian Municipal Law (45 B. C.), the charter of the\r\nRoman _Colonia Genetiva Julia_ (44 B. C.), and those of the Latin\r\nmunicipalities of Malaca and Salpensa (81–84 A. D.).\r\n\r\nThe constitutions of these municipalities were patterned closely after\r\nthat of Rome, although certain titles, like those of consul and Senate\r\nwere reserved for the capital city. Like Rome, the municipal towns had\r\ntheir officials, their council (_curia_, _ordo_), and their plebs. The\r\nchief magistrates were a pair of duovirs (or at times a college of\r\nquattuovirs), who were assisted by two aediles, and two quaestors The\r\nduovirs were in charge of the local administration of justice, and in\r\ngeneral conducted the public affairs of the community. Every fifth year\r\nthe duovirs were called _quinquennales_ and took the census. The aediles\r\nhad charge of public works, and market and police regulations, while the\r\nquaestors were the local treasury officials. All the officials were\r\nelected by popular vote, but a definite property qualification was\r\nrequired of each candidate. If no candidates presented themselves for any\r\nparticular office, provision was made for the nomination of candidates who\r\nmust serve if elected. At his election each magistrate paid into the\r\ntreasury, or expended in accordance with the direction of the council, a\r\ndefinite sum of money (_summa honoraria_), which varied for each office in\r\ndifferent communities. Oftentimes these officers did not restrict\r\nthemselves to the required sum but took this opportunity for displaying\r\ntheir municipal loyalty. As other prominent citizens followed their\r\nexample the municipalities were richly provided with useful and ornamental\r\npublic works donated by the richer classes. Thus the municipal offices,\r\nbeing unsalaried, were a heavy drain upon the resources of their holders,\r\nbut at the same time they offered almost the sole opportunity for\r\ngratifying the political ambitions of the population of the provinces. In\r\naddition to these civil officials, each community had its colleges of\r\npontiffs and augurs.\r\n\r\nThe members of the _curia_ were called _decuriones_, and were usually one\r\nhundred in number. They comprised those who had held some local\r\nmagistracy, and others having the requisite property qualification who\r\nwere enrolled directly (_adlecti_) in the council. The council supervised\r\nthe work of the magistrates and really directed the municipal\r\nadministration. As in early Rome, so in the municipalities the people were\r\ngrouped in _curiae_, which were the voting units in the local assembly or\r\n_comitia_. This assembly elected the magistrates and had legislative\r\npowers corresponding to those of the Roman assemblies. However, in the\r\ncourse of the second century A. D. these legislative powers passed into\r\nthe hands of the council, whose decrees became the sole form of municipal\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\n*The collegia.* While the plebs of Rome and the municipalities alike had\r\nlittle opportunity for political activity they found a compensation in the\r\nsocial life of their guilds or colleges. These were associations of\r\npersons who had some common tie, such as a common trade or profession, a\r\ncommon worship, or the humble desire to secure for themselves a decent\r\nburial by mutual coöperation. Thus arose professional, religious, and\r\nfunerary colleges. The organization of the colleges was modelled on that\r\nof the municipalities. They had their patrons, their presidents\r\n(_magistri_, or _quinquennales_), their quaestors, and their treasury\r\nsustained by initiation fees, monthly dues, fines, contributions, gifts\r\nand legacies. The membership was called plebs or _populus_. The chief\r\nfactor in the life of the colleges was the social element and their most\r\nimportant gatherings were for the purpose of holding a common banquet. The\r\nprofessional colleges in no way corresponded to the modern trades unions;\r\nthey attempted no collective bargaining with regard to wages, prices or\r\nworking hours, although they did not altogether neglect the common\r\ninterests of their profession.\r\n\r\nApparently until late republican times no restrictions had been placed\r\nupon the forming of such collegiate associations, but in 64 B. C. all such\r\nunions in Rome had been abolished because of the disorders occasioned by\r\npolitical clubs. In 58 B. C. complete freedom of association was restored,\r\nonly to be revoked again by Julius Caesar who permitted only the old and\r\nreputable professional and religious colleges to remain in existence.\r\nUnder Augustus a law was passed which regulated for the future the\r\ncharacter, organization and activities of these associations. New colleges\r\ncould only be established in Italy or the provinces if sanctioned by a\r\ndecree of the Senate or edict of the princeps, and membership in an\r\nunauthorized college was a treasonable offence. Trajan authorized the\r\nunrestricted formation of funerary colleges (_collegia tenuiorum_) in\r\nRome, and Septimius Severus extended this privilege to Italy and the\r\nprovinces. Under Marcus Aurelius the colleges were recognized as juristic\r\npersons, with power to manumit slaves and receive legacies. Not only\r\npersons of free birth but also freedmen and slaves, and in many cases\r\nwomen as well as men, were freely admitted to membership in the colleges.\r\n\r\n*The decline of the municipalities.* The prosperity of the empire depended\r\nupon the prosperity of the municipalities and it is in the latter that the\r\nfirst symptoms of internal decay are noticeable. These symptoms were\r\neconomic decline and the consequent loss of local autonomy. The reasons\r\nfor the economic decline are hard to trace. Among them we may perhaps\r\nplace the ruin of many of the wealthier families by the requirements of\r\noffice-holding, the withdrawal of others who were eligible for the\r\nimperial service with its salaried offices; overtaxation, bad management\r\nof local finances, and the disappearance of a free peasantry in the\r\nsurrounding rural districts who had furnished a market for the\r\nmanufacturers and merchants of the towns. The devastating wars of the\r\nthird century with the resultant general paralysis of trade and commerce,\r\nplus the depopulation caused by plague and barbarian invasions, struck the\r\nmunicipalities a crushing blow from which they never recovered.\r\n\r\nAs early as the time of Trajan the imperial government found it necessary\r\nto appoint officials called curators to reorganize the financial\r\nconditions in one or more municipalities, sometimes those of a whole\r\nprovince. At first these were irregular officials, senators or\r\nequestrians, but by the third century they had become a fixture in\r\nmunicipal administration and were chosen from among the local\r\n_decuriones_. Another evidence of the same conditions is the change which\r\ntook place in the position of the local magistracies. In the second\r\ncentury these offices were still an honor for which candidates voluntarily\r\npresented themselves, although there were unmistakable signs that in some\r\ndistricts they were coming to be regarded as a burden. In the third\r\ncentury the magistracies had become an obligation resting upon the local\r\nsenatorial order, and to which appointments were made by the _curia_. The\r\n_decurionate_ also had become a burden which all who possessed a definite\r\ncensus rating must assume. To assure itself of its revenues in view of the\r\ndeclining prosperity of the communities the imperial government had hit\r\nupon the expedient of making the local decurions responsible for\r\ncollecting the taxes, and consequently had been forced to make the\r\ndecurionate an obligatory status. The _curia_ and municipal magistracies\r\nhad ended by becoming unwilling cogs in the imperial financial\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nThis loss of municipal independence was accompanied by the conversion of\r\nthe voluntary professional colleges into compulsory public service\r\ncorporations. From the opening of the principate the government had\r\ndepended largely upon private initiative for the performance of many\r\nnecessary services in connection with the provisioning of the city of\r\nRome, a task which became increasingly complicated when the state\r\nundertook the distribution of oil under Septimius Severus, of bread in\r\nplace of grain and of cheap wine under Aurelian. Therefore such colleges\r\nas the shipowners (_navicularii_), bakers (_pistores_), pork merchants\r\n(_suarii_), wine merchants (_vinarii_), and oil merchants (_olerarii_)\r\nreceived official encouragement. Their members individually assumed public\r\ncontracts and in course of time came to receive certain privileges because\r\nit was recognized that they were performing services necessary to the\r\npublic welfare. Marcus Aurelius, Severus and Caracalla were among the\r\nemperors who thus fostered the professional guilds. Gradually the idea\r\ndeveloped that these services were public duties (_munera_) to which the\r\nseveral colleges were obligated, and hence Severus Alexander took the\r\ninitiative in founding new colleges until all the city trades were thus\r\norganized. The same princeps appointed judicial representatives from each\r\nguild and placed them under the jurisdiction of definite courts. The\r\ncolleges from this time onward operated under governmental supervision and\r\nreally formed a part of the machinery of the administration, although they\r\nhad not yet become compulsory and hereditary organizations.\r\n\r\nThe history of the colleges in the municipalities paralleled that of the\r\nRoman guilds, although it cannot be traced so clearly in detail. The best\r\nknown of the municipal colleges are those of the artificers (_fabri_), the\r\nmakers of rag cloths (_centonarii_), and the wood cutters (_dendrophori_).\r\nThe organization of these colleges was everywhere encouraged because their\r\nmembers had the obligation of acting as a local fire brigade, but in the\r\nexercise of their trades they were not in the service of their respective\r\ncommunities.\r\n\r\nIt was in the latter part of the third century, when the whole fabric of\r\nsociety seemed threatened with destruction, that the state, with the\r\nobject of maintaining organized industry and commerce, placed upon the\r\nproperties of the members of the various colleges in Rome and in the\r\nmunicipalities the burden of maintaining the work of these corporations; a\r\nburden which soon came also to be laid upon the individual members\r\nthereof. In this way the plebeian class throughout the empire sank to the\r\nstatus of laborers in the service of the state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       VI. THE COLONATE OR SERFDOM\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the municipal decurions, and the Roman and municipal plebs had thus\r\nsunk to the position of fiscally exploited classes, the bulk of the\r\nagricultural population of the empire had fallen into a species of serfdom\r\nknown to the Romans as the colonate, from the use of the word _colonus_ to\r\ndenote a tenant farmer. This condition arose under varying circumstances\r\nin the different parts of the empire, but its development in Italy and the\r\nWest was much influenced by the situation in some of the eastern\r\nprovinces, where the peasantry were in a state of quasi-serfdom prior to\r\nthe Roman conquest.\r\n\r\n*Egypt.* In Egypt under the Ptolemies the inhabitants of village\r\ncommunities were compelled to perform personal services to the state,\r\nincluding the cultivation of royal land not let out on contract, each\r\nwithin the boundaries of the community in which he was registered (his\r\n_idia_). With the introduction of Roman rule this theory of the _idia_ was\r\ngiven greater precision. All the land of each village had to be tilled by\r\nthe residents thereof, either as owners or tenants. At times, indeed, the\r\ninhabitants of one village might be forced to cultivate vacant lands at a\r\ndistance. During the seasons of sowing and harvest the presence of every\r\nvillager was required in his _idia_. The crushing weight of taxation,\r\nadded to the other obligations of the peasantry caused many of them to\r\nflee from their _idia_, and this led to an increasing amount of unleased\r\nstate land. As a large number of private estates had developed, chiefly\r\nbecause of the encouragement extended to those who brought waste land\r\nunder cultivation, the government forced the property holders to assume\r\nthe contracts for the vacant public lands in their districts. With the\r\nintroduction of the municipal councils in the course of the third century,\r\nthese were made responsible for the collection of the taxes of each nome.\r\nTo enable the councillors, who were property holders, to fulfill this\r\nobligation, their tenants were forbidden to leave their holdings. And so,\r\nas state or private tenants, the peasants came to be bound to the soil.\r\n\r\nThe development in Asia Minor was similar. There the royal lands of the\r\nSeleucids became the public land of Rome, and out of this the Roman\r\nmagnates of the later Republic developed vast estates which in turn were\r\nconcentrated in the hands of Augustus. These imperial domains were\r\ncultivated by peasants, who lived in village communities and paid a yearly\r\nrental for the land they occupied. The rest of the land of Asia formed the\r\nterritories dependent upon the Greek cities, and was occupied by a native\r\npopulation who were in part free peasants settled in villages. On the\r\nimperial domains the village came to be the _idia_ to which the peasant\r\nwas permanently attached for the performance of his liturgies or\r\nobligatory services, while on the municipal territories the agricultural\r\npopulation was bound to the soil as tenants of the municipal landholders,\r\nthe local senators, upon whom had been placed the responsibility for the\r\npayment of the taxes of their municipalities.\r\n\r\n*Africa.* In Africa the transformation was effected differently. There, at\r\nthe opening of the principate, outside of the municipal territories, the\r\nland fell into _ager publicus_, private estates of Roman senators and\r\nimperial domains. Under the early emperors, particularly Nero, the bulk of\r\nthe private estates passed by legacy and confiscation into the control of\r\nthe princeps, who also took over the administration of the public domain\r\nin so far as it was not absorbed in new municipal areas. This domain land\r\nwas divided into large districts (_tractus_, _regiones_) which were\r\ndirectly administered by imperial procurators. Each district comprised a\r\nnumber of estates (_saltus_, _fundi_). Whatever slave labor had at one\r\ntime been used in African agricultural operations was, by the early\r\nprincipate, largely displaced by free laborers, called _coloni_. These\r\n_coloni_ were either Italian immigrants or tributary native holders of the\r\npublic land.\r\n\r\nThe estates were usually managed as follows. The procurators leased them\r\nto tenant contractors (_conductores_), who retained a part of their lease\r\nholds under their own supervision, and sublet the remainder to tenant\r\nfarmers (_coloni_). The relation of these _coloni_ to the contractors as\r\nwell as to the owners of private estates or their bailiffs (_vilici_), was\r\nregulated by an edict of a certain Mancia, apparently a procurator under\r\nthe Flavians. By this edict the _coloni_ were obliged to pay a definite\r\nproportion of their crop as rental, and in addition to render a certain\r\nnumber of days’ work, personally and with their teams, on the land of the\r\nperson from whom they held their lease. The _coloni_ comprised both\r\nlandless residents on the estates and small landholders from neighboring\r\nvillages. They were encouraged to occupy vacant domain land and bring it\r\nunder cultivation. Over plough land thus cultivated they obtained the\r\nright of occupation for life, but orchard land became an hereditary\r\npossession, while in both cases the occupant was required to pay rental in\r\nkind to the state. Hadrian also tried to further the development of\r\npeasant landholders by permitting the _coloni_ to occupy any lands not\r\ntilled by the middlemen, and giving them rights of possession over all\r\ntypes of land. However, the forced services still remained and these\r\nconstituted the chief grievance of the _coloni_. And here the government\r\nwas on the horns of a dilemma, for if the middlemen were restrained from\r\nundue exactions often large areas remained untilled, and if the _coloni_\r\nwere oppressed they absconded and left their holdings without tenants.\r\n\r\nIt was in the course of the third century that the failure to create an\r\nadequate class of independent small farmers caused the state to fall back\r\nupon the development of large private estates as the only way of keeping\r\nthe land under cultivation and maintaining the public revenues. As a\r\nresult of this change of policy the middlemen were transformed from\r\ntenants into proprietors, and, like the landholders of Egypt, they were\r\nforced to assume the lease of vacant public land adjacent to their\r\nestates. But to make it possible for the proprietors to fulfill this\r\nobligation the state had to give them control over the labor needed to\r\ntill the soil. Hence the _coloni_ were forbidden to leave the estates\r\nwhere they had once established themselves as tenants. In Africa the\r\nestate became the _idia_ or _origo_ corresponding to the village in Egypt.\r\nIn the municipal territories the landholders of the towns played the rôle\r\nof the middlemen on the imperial domains.\r\n\r\n*Italy.* In Italy, unlike Africa, conditions upon the private, rather than\r\nthe imperial, domains determined the rise of the colonate. At the close of\r\nthe Republic the land of Italy was occupied by the _latifundia_ and\r\npeasant holdings, the former of which were by far the most important\r\nfactor in agricultural life. It will be recalled that the _latifundia_\r\nwere great plantations and ranches whose development had been facilitated\r\nby an abundant supply of cheap slave labor. However, even in the first\r\ncentury B. C. these plantations were partly tilled by free peasants,\r\neither as tenants or day laborers, and under the principate there was a\r\ngradual displacement of slaves by free _coloni_. The causes for this\r\ntransformation lay in the cutting off of the main supply of slaves through\r\nthe suppression of the slave-trading pirates and the cessation of\r\naggressive foreign wars, the decrease in the number of slaves through\r\nmanumissions, the growth of humanitarian tendencies which checked their\r\nruthless exploitation, and the realization that the employment of free\r\nlabor was in the long run more profitable than that of slaves,\r\nparticularly when the latter were becoming increasingly expensive to\r\nprocure. The _coloni_ worked the estates of the landowners for a certain\r\nproportion of the harvest. As elsewhere, in Italy it was fiscal necessity\r\nwhich converted the free _coloni_ into serfs. With the spread of waste\r\nlands, due partly to a decline of the population, the state intervened on\r\nbehalf of the landlords as it had in the provinces and attached the\r\npeasants to the domain where they had once been voluntary tenants.\r\nElsewhere throughout the empire, although the process cannot be traced in\r\ndetail, a similar transformation took place.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the ultimate responsibility for the development of the colonate\r\nmay rest upon the attempt of the imperial government to incorporate within\r\nthe empire vast territories in a comparatively low state of civilization,\r\nand upon the fiscal system whereby it was designed that the expenses\r\nimposed by this policy should be met. In the West the administration\r\nstrove to develop a strong class of prosperous peasants as state tenants;\r\nin the East its object was to maintain this class which was already in\r\nexistence. But the financial needs of the state caused such a heavy burden\r\nto be laid upon the agricultural population that the ideal of a prosperous\r\nfree peasantry proved impossible of realization. The ravages of war and\r\nplague in the second and third centuries also fell heavily upon the\r\npeasants. As a last resource to check the decline of agriculture the\r\ngovernment placed the small farmer at the disposal of the rich landlord\r\nand made him a serf. The results were oppression, poverty, lack of\r\ninitiative, a decline in the birth rate, flight and at the end an increase\r\nof uncultivated, unproductive land. The transplanting of conquered\r\nbarbarians within the empire swelled the class of the _coloni_ but proved\r\nonly a partial palliative to the general shrinkage of the agricultural\r\nelements. But the converse to the development of the colonate was the\r\ncreation of a powerful class of landholders who were the owners of large\r\ndomains exempt from the control of municipal authorities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n\r\n                           RELIGION AND SOCIETY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     I. SOCIETY UNDER THE PRINCIPATE\r\n\r\n\r\n*Imperial Rome.* Roman society under the Principate exhibits in general\r\nthe same characteristics as during the last century of the Republic. Rome\r\nitself was a thoroughly cosmopolitan city, where the concentration of\r\nwealth and political power attracted the ambitious, the adventurous and\r\nthe curious from all lands. Whole quarters were occupied by various\r\nnationalities, most prominent among whom were the Greeks, the Syrians, and\r\nthe Jews, speaking their own languages and plying their native trades.\r\nWith the freeborn foreign population mingled the thousands of slaves and\r\nfreedmen of every race and tongue. During the first and second century the\r\npopulation of Rome must have been in the neighborhood of one million, but\r\nin the third century it began to decline as a result of pestilence and the\r\ngeneral bankruptcy of the empire. Inevitably in such a city there were the\r\nsharpest contrasts between riches and poverty, and the luxurious palaces\r\nof the wealthy were matched by the squalid tenements of the proletariat.\r\nIn outward appearance Rome underwent a transformation which made her\r\nworthy to be capital of so vast an empire. This was largely due to the\r\ngreat number of public buildings erected by the various emperors and to\r\nthe lavish employment of marble in public and private architecture from\r\nthe time of Augustus. The temples, basilicas, fora, aqueducts, public\r\nbaths, theatres, palaces, triumphal arches, statues, and parks combined to\r\narouse the enthusiastic admiration of travelers and the pride of its\r\ninhabitants. But, although after the great fire of 64 A. D. many\r\nimprovements were made in the plan of the city, restrictions placed upon\r\nthe height of buildings, and fireproof construction required for the lower\r\nstories, still the streets remained narrow and dingy, the lofty tenements\r\nwere of flimsy construction, in perpetual danger of collapse, and\r\ndevastating conflagrations occurred periodically.\r\n\r\nThe task of feeding the city plebs and providing for their entertainment\r\nwas a ruinous legacy left by the Republic to the principate. Although the\r\nnumber of recipients of free corn was not increased after Augustus, the\r\npublic spectacles became ever more numerous and more magnificent. Under\r\nTiberius eighty-seven days of the year were regularly occupied by these\r\nentertainments but by the time of Marcus Aurelius there were one hundred\r\nand thirty-five such holidays. In addition came extraordinary festivals to\r\ncelebrate special occasions, like the one hundred and twenty-three day\r\ncarnival given by Trajan at his second Dacian triumph in 106 A. D. The\r\nspectacles were of three main types; the chariot races in the circus, the\r\ngladiatorial combats and animal baiting in the amphitheatre, and the\r\ndramatic and other performances in the theatre. The expense of these\r\ncelebrations fell upon the senatorial order and the princeps. Indeed the\r\nmost important function of the consulship, praetorship and, until its\r\ndisappearance in the third century, the aedileship, came to be the\r\ncelebration of the regular festivals. The sums provided for such purposes\r\nby the state were entirely inadequate and so the cost had to be met\r\nlargely from the magistrates’ private resources. The extraordinary\r\nspectacles were all given at the expense of the princeps who also at times\r\ngranted subventions to favored senators from the imperial purse. The cost\r\nof the public shows placed as heavy a drain upon the fortunes of the\r\nsenatorial order as did the _summa honoraria_ upon the holders of\r\nmunicipal offices.\r\n\r\nA new feature of Roman society under the principate was the growth of the\r\nimperial court. In spite of the wishes of Augustus and some of his\r\nsuccessors to live on a footing of equality with the rest of the nobility,\r\nit was inevitable that the exceptional political power of the princeps\r\nshould give a corresponding importance to his household organization.\r\nDefinite offices developed within the imperial household not only for the\r\nconduct of public business but also for the control of slaves and freedmen\r\nin the domestic service of the princeps. The chief household officials\r\nwere the chamberlain _a cubiculo_ and the chief usher (_ab admissione_).\r\nBecause of their intimate personal association with the princeps their\r\ninfluence over him was very great, and as a rule they did not hesitate to\r\nuse their position to enrich themselves at the expense of those who sought\r\nthe imperial favor. From among the senators and equestrians the princeps\r\nchose a number of intimate associates and advisors who were called his\r\n“friends.” When forming part of his cortege away from Rome they were known\r\nas his companions (_comites Augusti_). In connection with the imperial\r\naudiences a certain degree of ceremonial developed, with fixed forms of\r\nsalutation which differentiated the rank and station of those attending\r\nthese functions. In the society of the capital the personal tastes of the\r\nprinceps set the fashion of the day.\r\n\r\n*Clients.* Characteristic of the times was the new form of clientage which\r\nwas a voluntary association of master and paid retainer. Under the\r\nrepublic eminent men had throngs of adherents to greet them at their\r\nmorning reception and accompany them to the forum. It had now become\r\nobligatory for practically every man of wealth to maintain such a retinue,\r\nwhich should be at his beck and call at all hours of the day and be\r\nprepared to serve him in various ways. In return the patron helped to\r\nsupport his clients with fees, food, and gifts of clothing, and rendered\r\nthem other favors. The clients were recruited partly from freedmen, partly\r\nfrom citizens of low birth, and partly from persons of the better class\r\nwho had fallen upon evil days. In general the lot of these pensioners does\r\nnot seem to have been a very happy one—even the slaves of their patrons\r\ndespised them—and their large numbers are to be attributed to the superior\r\nattractions of city over country life, and to the stigma which in Rome\r\nrested upon industrial employment.\r\n\r\n*Slaves and freedmen.* In the early principate slave-holding continued on\r\nas large a scale as in the late republic. The palaces of the wealthy in\r\nRome could count slaves by hundreds; on the larger plantations they were\r\nnumbered by thousands. Trained slaves were also employed in great numbers\r\nin various trades and industries. Their treatment varied according to\r\ntheir employment and the character of their owners, but there was a steady\r\nprogress towards greater humanitarianism, largely due to the influence of\r\nphilosophic doctrines. In the age of the Antonines this produced\r\nlegislation which limited the power of the master over his slave. As time\r\nwent on the number of slaves steadily diminished, in part because of the\r\ncessation of continual foreign wars after the time of Augustus, in part\r\nbecause of the great increase of manumissions. Not only were large numbers\r\nset free at the death of their owners as a final act of generosity, but\r\nalso many found it profitable to liberate their slaves and provide them\r\nwith capital to engage in business for themselves. Many slaves also had\r\ngood opportunities for accumulating a small store of money (_peculium_)\r\nwith which they could purchase their freedom.\r\n\r\nThe result of these wholesale manumissions was a tremendous increase in\r\nthe freedmen class. Foreseeing the effect that this would have upon the\r\nRoman citizen body, Augustus endeavored to restrict the right of\r\nemancipation. By the _lex Fufia Caninia_ (2 B. C.) testamentary\r\nmanumissions were limited to a fixed proportion of the total number of\r\nslaves held by the deceased, and not more than one hundred allowed in any\r\ncase. The _lex Aelia Sentia_ (4 A. D.) placed restrictions upon the\r\nmaster’s right of manumission during his lifetime, and the Junian law of\r\nabout the same time prevented slaves liberated without certain formalities\r\nfrom receiving Roman citizenship although granting them the status of\r\nLatins. Even freedmen who became Romans lacked the right of voting or of\r\nholding office in Rome or the municipalities, unless they received from\r\nthe princeps the right to wear the gold ring which gave them the\r\nprivileges of freeborn citizens. In spite of these laws the number of the\r\nfreedmen grew apace, and there is no doubt that in the course of the\r\nprincipate the racial characteristics of the population of Rome and of the\r\nwhole peninsula of Italy underwent a complete transformation as a result\r\nof the infusion of this new element, combined with the emigration of\r\nItalians to the provinces.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the rôle played by the freedmen in Roman society was in\r\nproportion to their numbers. From them were recruited the lower ranks of\r\nthe civil service, they filled every trade and profession, the commerce of\r\nthe empire was largely in their hands, they became the managers of estates\r\nand of business undertakings of all sorts. The eager pursuit of money at\r\nall costs was their common characteristic, and “freedman’s wealth” was a\r\nproverbial expression for riches quickly acquired. The more successful of\r\ntheir class became landholders in Italy and aped the life and manners of\r\nthe nobility. Their lack of good taste, so common to the _nouveaux riches_\r\nof all ages, afforded a good target for the jibes of satirists and is\r\ncaricatured in the novel of Petronius. We have already seen the influence\r\nof the few among them who by the emperors’ favor attained positions of\r\npolitical importance. Despise the freedmen though they might, the Romans\r\nfound them indispensable for the conduct of public and private business.\r\n\r\n*Commerce and industry.* The restoration of peace within the empire, the\r\nsuppression of piracy, the extension of the Roman military highways\r\nthroughout all the provinces, the establishment of a single currency valid\r\nfor the whole empire, and the low duties levied at the provincial customs\r\nfrontiers combined to produce an hitherto unexampled development of\r\ncommercial enterprise. Traders from all parts of the provinces thronged\r\nthe ports of Italy, and one merchant of Hierapolis in Phrygia has left a\r\nrecord of his seventy-two voyages there. But Roman commerce was not\r\nconfined within the Roman borders, it also flourished with outside\r\npeoples, particularly those of the East. From the ports of Egypt on the\r\nRed Sea large merchant fleets sailed for southern Arabia and India, while\r\na brisk caravan trade through the Parthian and Bactrian kingdoms brought\r\nthe silks of China to the Roman markets. Even the occasional presence of\r\nRoman merchants in China is vouched for by Chinese records. Among all the\r\nraces of the empire the most active in these mercantile ventures were the\r\nSyrians, whose presence may be traced not only in the commercial centers\r\nof the East, but also in the harbors of Italy and throughout all the\r\nwestern provinces.\r\n\r\nThe increased opportunities for trading stimulated the development of\r\nmanufacturing, for not only could raw materials be more easily procured\r\nbut towns favorably situated for the manufacture of particular types of\r\ngoods could find a wider market for their products. However, industrial\r\norganization never attained a high degree of development. In the\r\nproduction of certain wares, such as articles of bronze, silver, glass,\r\nand, especially, pottery and bricks, the factory system seems to have been\r\nemployed, with a division of labor among specialized artisans. In general,\r\nhowever, this was not the case and each manufactured article was the\r\nproduct of one man’s labor. In Italy, and probably throughout the western\r\nprovinces, the bulk of the work of this sort was done by slaves and\r\nfreedmen.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the art of agriculture had been developed to a very high\r\ndegree, and Columella, an agricultural writer of the time of Nero, shows a\r\ngood knowledge of the principles of fertilization and rotation of crops.\r\n\r\nHowever, this material prosperity, which attained its height early in the\r\nsecond century of our era, declined from reasons which have already been\r\ndescribed until the whole empire reached a state of economic bankruptcy in\r\nthe course of the third century. The progressive bankruptcy of the\r\ngovernment is shown by the steady deterioration of the coinage. Under Nero\r\nthe denarius, the standard silver coin, was first debased. This debasement\r\ncontinued until under Septimius Severus it became one half copper.\r\nCaracalla issued a new silver coin, the Antoninianus, one and a half times\r\nthe weight of the denarius of the day. Both these coins rapidly\r\ndeteriorated in quality until they became mere copper coins with a wash of\r\nsilver. Aurelian made the first attempt to correct this evil by issuing\r\nonly the Antoninianus and giving this a standard value.\r\n\r\nTo pass a moral judgment upon society under the principate is a difficult\r\ntask. The society depicted in the satires of Juvenal and in Martial, in\r\nthe court gossip of Suetonius, or in the polemics of the Christian writers\r\nseems hopelessly corrupt and vicious. But their picture is not complete.\r\nThe letters of Pliny reveal an entirely different world with a high\r\nstandard of human conduct, whose ideals are expressed in the philosophic\r\ndoctrines of Seneca and Marcus Aurelius. And the funerary inscriptions\r\nfrom the municipalities, where life was more wholesome and simple than in\r\nthe large cities, pay a sincere tribute to virtue in all its forms. The\r\nluxurious extravagance of imperial Rome has been equalled and surpassed in\r\nmore recent times, and, apart from the vices of slavery and the arena,\r\nmodern society has little wherewith to reproach that of the principate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        II. THE INTELLECTUAL WORLD\r\n\r\n\r\n*Literature.* The principate had two literatures; one Greek, the other\r\nRoman. But the forms of literary production were the same in each, and the\r\nRoman authors took rank with those of Greece in their respective fields.\r\nFor the Romans could boast that they had adapted the Latin tongue to the\r\nliterary types of the older culture world, while preserving in their work\r\na spirit genuinely Roman.\r\n\r\n*The Augustan age.* The feeling of relief produced by the cessation of the\r\ncivil wars, and the hopes engendered by the policy of Augustus inspired a\r\ngroup of writers whose genius made the age of Augustus the culminating\r\npoint in the development of Roman poetry, like the age of Cicero in Roman\r\nprose. Foremost among the poets of the new era was Virgil (70–19 B. C.),\r\nthe son of a small landholder of Mantua, whose _Aeneid_, a national epic,\r\nthe glorification alike of Rome and of the Julian house, placed him with\r\nHomer in the front rank of epic poets for all time. His greatest\r\ncontemporary was Horace (65–8 B. C.), the son of a freedman from South\r\nItaly. It was Horace who first wrote Latin lyrics in the complicated\r\nmeters of Greece, and whose genial satire and insight into human nature\r\nhave combined with his remarkable happiness of phrase to make him the\r\ndelight of cultivated society both in antiquity and modern times. The\r\nleading elegiac poets were Propertius, Tibullus and Ovid (43 B. C.–17\r\nA. D.). In his _Fasti_ and _Metamorphoses_ the latter recounted with\r\nmasterly narrative skill the legends of Greek and Roman mythology. His\r\nelegies reveal the spirit of the pleasure-seeking society of new Rome and\r\nshow the ineffectiveness of the attempt of Augustus to bring about a moral\r\nregeneration of the Roman people. This, probably, was the true ground for\r\nhis banishment from Rome. Livy (59 B. C.–17 A. D.) was the one prose\r\nwriter of note in the Augustan age. His history of Rome is a great work of\r\nart, an _Aeneid_ in prose, which celebrated the past greatness of Rome and\r\nthe virtues whereby this had been attained—those virtues which Augustus\r\naimed to revive.\r\n\r\n*The age of Nero.* From Augustus to Nero there are no names of note in\r\nRoman literature, but under the latter came a slight reawakening of\r\nliterary productivity. Seneca (4 B. C.–65 A. D.), a Spaniard from Corduba,\r\nNero’s tutor, minister and victim, is best known as the exponent of the\r\npractical Stoic religion and the only Roman tragedian whose works have\r\nsurvived. His nephew Lucan (39–65 A. D.) portrayed in his epic, the\r\n_Pharsalia_, the struggle of the republicans against Julius Caesar. His\r\nwork shows a reawakening of a vain republican idealism and is the\r\ncounterpart to the Stoic opposition in the senate. Petronius (d. 66\r\nA. D.), the arbiter of the refinements of luxury at Nero’s court,\r\ndisplayed his originality by giving, in the form of a novel, a skilful and\r\nlively picture of the society of the freedmen in the Greek municipalities\r\nof South Italy.\r\n\r\n*The Flavian era.* Under the Flavians, Pliny the Elder (23–79 A. D.), a\r\nnative of Cisalpine Gaul, compiled his _Natural History_, which he aimed\r\nto make an encyclopaedia of information on the whole world of nature. It\r\nis a work of monumental industry but displays a lack of critical acumen\r\nand scientific training. At about the same time there taught in Rome the\r\nSpaniard Quintilian (d. 95 A. D.), who wrote on the theory and practice of\r\nrhetoric, expressing in charming prose the Ciceronian ideal of life and\r\neducation. His countryman Martial (d. 102 A. D.) gave in satiric epigrams\r\nglimpses of the meaner aspects of contemporary life.\r\n\r\n*Tacitus and his contemporaries.* The freer atmosphere of the government\r\nof Nerva and Trajan allowed the senatorial aristocracy to voice feelings\r\ncarefully suppressed under the terror of Domitian. Their spokesman was\r\nTacitus (55–116 A. D.), a man of true genius, who ranks next to Thucydides\r\nas the representative of artistic historical writing in ancient times. His\r\n_Treatise on the Orators_, his _Life of Agricola_, and his descriptive\r\naccount of the German peoples (_Germania_) were preludes to two great\r\nhistorical works, the _Annals_ and the _Histories_, which together covered\r\nthe period from 14–96 A. D. His attitude is strongly influenced by the\r\npersecutions of senators under Domitian, and is the expression of his\r\npersonal animosity and that of the descendants of the older republican\r\nnobility towards the principate in general. A friend of Tacitus, the\r\nyounger Pliny (62–113 A. D.), imitated Cicero in collecting and publishing\r\nhis letters. This correspondence is valuable as an illustration of the\r\nlife and literary diletantism of educated circles of the day, as also for\r\nthe light it throws upon the administrative policies of Trajan. An\r\nembittered critic of the age was the satirist Juvenal (d. about 130\r\nA. D.), from Aquinum in Italy, who wrote from a stoical standpoint but\r\nwith little learning and narrow vision. Somewhat later the first literary\r\nhistory of Rome was written by Suetonius (75–150 A. D.), who is better\r\nknown as the author of the _Lives of the Caesars_ (from Julius to\r\nDomitian), a series of gossipy narratives which set the style for future\r\nhistorical writing in Rome.\r\n\r\nWith Hadrian begins the period of archaism in Roman literature, that is,\r\nan artificial return to the Latin of Cato, Ennius and Plautus, an\r\nunmistakable symptom of intellectual sterility.\r\n\r\n*Provincial literature.* The progress of Romanization in the provinces is\r\nclearly marked by the participation of provincials in the literary life of\r\nRome. From the Cisalpine, from Narbonese Gaul, and from Spain, men with\r\nliterary instincts and ability had been drawn to the capital as the sole\r\nplace where their talents would find recognition. But gradually some of\r\nthe provinces developed a Latin culture of their own. The first evidences\r\nof this change came from the age of the Antonines, when a Latin literature\r\nmade its appearance in the province of Africa. Its earliest representative\r\nwas the sophist Apuleius, the author of the romance entitled _The Golden\r\nAss_.\r\n\r\n*Christian literature.* It was in Africa also that a Latin Christian\r\nliterature first arose, and it was the African Christian writers who made\r\nLatin the language of the church in Italy and the West. Of these Christian\r\napologists the earliest and most influential was Tertullian of Carthage,\r\nwhose literary activity falls in the time of the Severi. Cyprian and\r\nArnobius continued his task in the third century. In Minucius Felix, a\r\ncontemporary of Tertullian, the Christian community at Rome found an able\r\ndefender of the faith.\r\n\r\n*Jurisprudence.* In all other sciences the Romans sat at the feet of the\r\nGreeks, but in that of jurisprudence they displayed both independence and\r\noriginality. The growth of Roman jurisprudence was not hampered but\r\nfurthered by the establishment of the principate, for the development of a\r\nuniform administrative system for the whole empire called for the\r\ncorresponding development of a uniform system of law. The study of law was\r\nstimulated by the practice of Augustus and his successors who gave to\r\nprominent jurists the right of publicly giving opinions (_jus publice\r\nrespondendi_) by his authority on the legal merits of cases under trial. A\r\nfurther encouragement was given by Hadrian’s organization of his judicial\r\ncouncil. The great service of the jurists of the principate was the\r\nintroduction into Roman law of the principles of equity founded on a\r\nphilosophic conception of natural law and the systematic organization and\r\ninterpretation of the body of the civil law. Roman jurisprudence reached\r\nits height between the accession of Hadrian and the death of Severus\r\nAlexander. The chief legal writers of this period were Julian in the time\r\nof Hadrian, Gaius in the age of the Antonines, his contemporary Scaevola,\r\nthe three celebrated jurists of the time of the Severi—Papinian, Paul and\r\nUlpian, all pretorian prefects,—and lastly Modestine, who closes the long\r\nline of classic juris-consults.\r\n\r\n*Greek literature.* If we except the brief period of the Augustan age, the\r\nGreek literature of the principate stands both in quantity and quality\r\nabove the Latin. Even Augustus had recognized Greek as the language of\r\ngovernment in the eastern half of the empire, and with the gradual\r\nabandonment of his policy of preserving the domination of the Italians\r\nover the provincials Greeks stood upon the same footing as the Latin\r\nspeaking provincials in the eyes of the imperial government. In Rome the\r\nGreek author received the same recognition as his Roman _confrère_. Greek\r\nhistorians, geographers, scientists, rhetoricians and philosophers wrote\r\nnot only for Greeks, but for the educated circles of the whole empire. And\r\nit was in Greek that the princeps Marcus Aurelius chose to write his\r\nMeditations. Nor should it be forgotten that Greek was the language of the\r\nearly Christian writers, beginning with the Apostle Paul. By the opening\r\nof the third century the champions of the new faith had begun to rank\r\namong the leading authors of the day in the East as well as in the West.\r\n\r\n*Plutarch (c. 50–120 A. D.) and Lucian (c. 125–200 A. D.)**.* The best\r\nknown names in the Greek literature of the principate are Plutarch and\r\nLucian. Plutarch’s _Parallel Lives_ of famous Greeks and Romans possess a\r\nperpetual freshness and charm. Lucian was essentially a writer of prose\r\nsatires, a journalist who was “the last great master of Attic eloquence\r\nand Attic wit.” In the realm of science, Ptolemy the astronomer, and Galen\r\nthe student of medicine, both active in the second century, profoundly\r\ninfluenced their own and subsequent times.\r\n\r\n*Philosophy.* As we have seen, the doctrines of Stoicism continued to\r\nappeal to the highest instincts of Roman character. Besides Seneca and\r\nMarcus Aurelius this creed found a worthy exponent in the ex-slave\r\nEpictetus, who taught between 90 and 120 A. D. at Nicopolis in Epirus.\r\nWith Plotinus (204–270 A. D.), Greek philosophy became definitely\r\nreligious in character, resting upon the basis of revelation and belief,\r\nnot upon that of reason.\r\n\r\n*Art.* Roman art found its chief inspiration in, and remained in close\r\ncontact with, Roman public life. The artists of the principate may well\r\nhave been Greeks, but they wrought for Romans and had to satisfy Roman\r\nstandards of taste. Realism and careful attention to details may be said\r\nto be the two great characteristics of Roman art. This is true both of\r\nRoman sculpture, which excelled in statues, portrait busts, and the\r\nbas-reliefs depicting historical events with which public monuments were\r\nrichly decorated, and of the repoussé and relief work which adorned table\r\nware and other articles of silver, bronze and pottery. The Roman fondness\r\nfor costly decorations is well illustrated by the elaborateness of the\r\nfrescoes and the mosaics of the villas of Pompeii, and other sites where\r\nexcavations have revealed the interiors of Roman public and private\r\nbuildings. The erection of the many temples, basilicas, baths, aqueducts,\r\nbridges, amphitheatres and other structures in Rome, Italy and other\r\nprovinces supplied a great stimulus to Roman architecture and engineering.\r\nIt was in the use of the arch and the vault, particularly the vault of\r\nconcrete, that the Roman architects excelled, and their highest\r\nachievements were great vaulted structures like the Pantheon and the Baths\r\nof Caracalla. The most striking testimony to the grandeur of Rome comes\r\nfrom the remains of Roman architecture in the provinces—from such imposing\r\nruins as the Porta Nigra of Trèves, the theatre at Orange, the Pont du\r\nGard near Nîmes, the bridge over the Tagus at Alcantara and the\r\namphitheatres of Nîmes in France and El-Djemm in Tunisia. But, like the\r\nliterature, the Roman art of the principate in time experienced a loss of\r\ncreative power. It reached its height under the Flavians and Trajan and\r\nthen a steady deterioration set in.\r\n\r\n*Causes of intellectual decline.* The third century A. D. witnessed a\r\ngeneral collapse of ancient civilization, no less striking in its cultural\r\nthan in its political and economic aspects. This cultural decline was the\r\nresult of political causes which had been gradually undermining the\r\nfoundations of a vigorous intellectual life. The culture of Greece\r\nculminated in its scientific achievements of the third century B. C. At\r\nthat time in comparison with the Greeks the neighboring, peoples were at\r\nbest semi-barbarians; in the eastern Mediterranean the Greeks were the\r\ndominant race, still animated by a strong love of political freedom. But\r\nthe Roman conquest with its ruthless exploitation of the provinces ruined\r\nthe Greek world economically and broke the morale of the Greek peoples,\r\nforcing them to seek their salvation in fawning servility to Rome. The\r\nconsequence was that as the Greeks came under the dominion of Rome their\r\ncreative impulses withered, their intellectual progress ceased and their\r\neyes were turned backward upon their past achievements. And the Italians\r\nthemselves were on too low an intellectual level to develop a culture of\r\ntheir own. They had not progressed beyond the adoption of certain aspects\r\nof Greek culture before the century of civil wars between 133 and 30 B. C.\r\nresulted in the establishment of a type of government which gradually\r\ncrushed out the spirit of initiative in the Latin speaking world. The\r\nmaterial prosperity and peace during the first two centuries of the\r\nprincipate made possible the diffusion of a uniform type of culture\r\nthroughout the empire as a whole, but after the age of Augustus this is\r\ncharacterized both in the East and in the West by its imitation of the\r\npast and its lack of creative power. The third century A. D. with its long\r\nperiod of civil war, foreign invasions, and economic chaos, dealt a fatal\r\nblow to the material basis of ancient civilization. The collapse of\r\nGraeco-Roman culture was rapid and complete, resembling the breakdown of\r\nthe civilization of the Aegean Bronze age toward the close of the second\r\nmillennium before the Christian era. Culturally, the fourth century A. D.\r\nbelongs to the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   III. THE IMPERIAL CULT AND THE ORIENTAL RELIGIONS IN ROMAN PAGANISM\r\n\r\n\r\n*The religious transformation of the Roman world.* The religious\r\ntransformation of the Roman world during the principate was fully as\r\nimportant for future ages as its political transformation. This religious\r\ndevelopment consisted in the diffusion throughout the empire of a group of\r\nreligions which originated in the countries bordering the eastern shores\r\nof the Mediterranean and hence are generally known as Oriental cults. And\r\namong these oriental religions are included both Judaism and Christianity.\r\n\r\n*The state cults.* However, the worship of the divinities of Graeco-Roman\r\ntheology by no means died out during the first three centuries of the\r\nChristian era. It continued to flourish in the state cult of Rome, and the\r\nmunicipal cults of the Italian and provincial towns. With the romanization\r\nof the semi-barbarous provinces Graeco-Roman deities displaced or\r\nassimilated to themselves the gods of the native populations. Druidism,\r\nthe national religion of Gaul and Britain, was suppressed chiefly because\r\nit fostered a spirit of resistance to Roman rule. But the most widespread\r\nand vigorous of the state cults was the worship of the princeps.\r\n\r\n*The imperial cult.* We have already discussed the establishment of the\r\nimperial cult by Augustus, as a visible expression of the loyalty of the\r\nprovincials and their acknowledgment of the authority of Rome and the\r\nprinceps. We have also seen how this cult was perpetuated by the\r\nprovincial councils organized for that purpose. After the death of\r\nAugustus the imperial cult in the provinces gradually came to include the\r\nworship of both the ruling Augustus and the _Divi_, or deceased emperors,\r\nwho had received deification at the hands of the Senate. This practise was\r\nestablished in all the eastern provinces after the time of Claudius, and\r\nin the West under the Flavians. In Rome where the cult of the ruling\r\nprinceps was not practised, Domitian converted the temple of Augustus into\r\na temple of the _Divi_ or the Caesars.\r\n\r\n*The pagan Oriental cults.* The pagan Oriental cults whose penetration of\r\nthe European provinces is so marked a feature in the religious life of the\r\nprincipate were the cults of the peoples of western Asia and Egypt which\r\nhad become Hellenized and adapted for world expansion after Alexander’s\r\nconquest of the Persian empire. From this time onward they spread\r\nthroughout the Greek culture world but it was not until the establishment\r\nof the world empire of Rome with its facilities for, and stimulus to,\r\nintercourse between all peoples within the Roman frontiers that they were\r\nable to obtain a foothold in western Europe. Their penetration of Italy\r\nbegan with the official reception of the cult of the Great Mother of\r\nPessinus at Rome in 205 B. C., but the Roman world as a whole held aloof\r\nfrom them until the close of the republic. However, during the first two\r\ncenturies of the principate they gradually made their way over the western\r\nparts of the empire.\r\n\r\nThe expansion of the Oriental cults followed the lines of the much\r\nfrequented trade routes along which they were carried by travelers,\r\nmerchants and colonies of oriental traders. The army cantonments were also\r\ncenters for their diffusion, not only through the agency of troops\r\nrecruited in the East but also through detachments which had seen service\r\nthere in the course of the numerous wars on the eastern frontiers.\r\nLikewise the oriental slaves were active propagandists of their native\r\nfaiths.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of the ready reception of these cults among all classes of\r\nsociety is that they guaranteed their adherents a satisfaction which the\r\nofficial religions were unable to offer. The state and municipal cults\r\nwere mainly political in character, and with the disappearance of\r\nindependent political life they lost their hold upon men who began to seek\r\na refuge from the miseries of the present world in the world of the spirit\r\nand the promise of a future life. This want the Oriental cults were able\r\nto meet with the doctrines of a personal religion far different from the\r\nformal worship of the Graeco-Roman deities.\r\n\r\nCertain characteristics of doctrine and ritual were common to the majority\r\nof the Oriental cults. They had an elaborate ritual which appealed both to\r\nthe senses and to the emotions of the worshippers. By witnessing certain\r\nsymbolic ceremonies the believer was roused to a state of spiritual\r\necstasy in which he felt himself in communion with the deity, while by the\r\nperformance of sacramental rites he felt himself cleansed from the\r\ndefilements of his earthly life and fitted for a purer spiritual\r\nexistence. A professional priesthood had charge of the worship, ministered\r\nto the needs of individuals, and conducted missionary work. To an age of\r\ndeclining intellectual vigor, when men gave over the attempt to solve by\r\nscientific methods the riddle of the universe, they spoke with the\r\nauthority of revelation, giving a comforting theological interpretation of\r\nlife. And they appealed to the conscience by imposing a rigid rule of\r\nconduct, the observance of which would fit the believer for a happier\r\nexistence in a future life.\r\n\r\nThe most important of these oriental divinities were the Great Mother of\r\nPessinus, otherwise known as Cybele, worshipped in company with the male\r\ndeity Attis; the Egyptian pair Isis and Serapis; Atayatis or the Syrian\r\ngoddess, the chief female divinity of North Syria; a number of Syrian gods\r\n(Ba’als) named from the site of their Syrian shrines; and finally Mithra,\r\na deity whose cult had long formed a part of the national Iranian\r\nreligion. Towards all these cults the Roman state displayed wide\r\ntoleration, only interfering with them when their orgiastic rites came\r\ninto conflict with Roman conceptions of morality. But in spite of this\r\ntoleration it required a long time before the conservative prejudices of\r\nthe upper classes of Roman society were sufficiently undermined to permit\r\nof their participation in these foreign rites. For one hundred years after\r\nthe introduction of the worship of the Magna Mater Romans were prohibited\r\nfrom enrolling themselves in the ranks of her priesthood. A determined but\r\nunsuccessful attempt was made by the Senate during the last century of the\r\nrepublic to drive from Rome the cult of Isis, the second of these\r\nreligions to find a home in Italy, and in 42 B. C. the triumvirs erected a\r\ntemple to this goddess. Augustus, however, banished her worship beyond the\r\n_pomerium_. But this restriction was not enforced by his successors, and\r\nby 69 A. D. the cult of the Egyptian goddess was firmly established in the\r\ncapital. The various Syrian deities were of less significance in the\r\nreligious life of the West, although as we have seen Elagabalus set up the\r\nworship of one of them, the Sun god of Emesa, as an official cult at Rome.\r\n\r\nThe Oriental cult which in importance overshadowed all the rest was\r\nMithraism, one of the latest to cross from Asia into Europe. In\r\nZoroastrian theology Mithra appears as the spirit who is the chief agent\r\nof the supreme god of light Ormuzd in his struggle against Ahriman, the\r\ngod of darkness. He is at the same time a beneficent force in the natural\r\nworld and in the moral world the champion of righteousness against the\r\npowers of evil. Under Babylonian and Greek influences Mithra was\r\nidentified with the Sun-god, and appears in Rome with the title the\r\nUnconquered Sun-god Mithra (_deus invictus sol Mithra_). Towards the close\r\nof the first century A. D. Mithraism began to make its influence felt in\r\nRome and the western provinces, and from that time it spread with great\r\nrapidity. Mithra, as the god of battles, was a patron deity of the\r\nsoldiers, who became his zealous missionaries in the frontier camps. His\r\ncult was also regarded with particular favor by the emperors, whose\r\nauthority it supported by the doctrine that the ruler is the chosen of\r\nOrmuzd and an embodiment of the divine spirit. It is not surprising then\r\nthat Aurelian, whose coins bore the legend _dominus et deus natus_ (born\r\ngod and lord), made the worship of the Unconquered Sun-god the chief cult\r\nof the state.\r\n\r\n*Philosophy.* Attention has already been called to the value of Stoicism\r\nin supplying its adherents with a highly moral code of conduct. Other\r\nphilosophical systems, notably Epicureanism, likewise inculcated\r\nparticular rules of life. But the philosophical doctrines which were best\r\nable to hold their own with the new religions were those of Neoplatonism\r\nand Neopythagoreanism, which came into vogue in the course of the second\r\ncentury, and exhibited a combination of mysticism and idealism well suited\r\nto the spirit of the age.\r\n\r\n*Astrology and magic.* Throughout the principate all classes of society\r\nwere deeply imbued with a superstitious fatalism which caused them to\r\nplace implicit belief in the efficacy of astrology and magic. Chaldean and\r\nEgyptian astrologers enjoyed a great reputation, and were consulted on all\r\nimportant questions. They were frequently banished from Rome by the\r\nemperors who feared that their predictions might give encouragement to\r\ntheir enemies. However, these very emperors kept astrologers in their own\r\nservice, and the decrees of banishment never remained long in force. The\r\nalmost universal belief in miracles and oracles caused the appearance of a\r\nlarge number of imposters who throve on the credulity of their clients.\r\nOne of the most celebrated of these was the Alexander who founded a new\r\noracle of Aesculapius at Abonoteichus in Paphlagonia, the fame of which\r\nspread throughout the whole empire and even beyond its borders. In his\r\nexposé of the methods employed by this false prophet, the satirist Lucian\r\ngives a vivid picture of the depraved superstition of his time.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the principate the pagan world presented a great confusion\r\nof religious beliefs and doctrines. However, the various pagan cults were\r\ntolerant one of another, for the followers of one god were ready to\r\nacknowledge the divinity of the gods worshipped by their neighbors. On the\r\ncontrary, the adherents of Judaism and Christianity refused to recognize\r\nthe pagan gods, and hence stood in irreconcilable opposition to the whole\r\npagan world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n           IV. CHRISTIANITY AND ITS RELATION TO THE ROMAN STATE\r\n\r\n\r\n*The Jews of the Roman empire.* Alexander the Great’s conquest of the Near\r\nEast had thrown open to the Jews the whole Graeco-Macedonian world, and\r\nJewish settlements rapidly appeared in all its important commercial\r\ncenters. The Jewish colonies were encouraged by the Hellenistic monarchs\r\nwho granted them immunity from military service, protection in the\r\nexercise of their religion, and a privileged judicial status in the cities\r\nwhere they were established. In course of time the number of Jews in these\r\n_diaspora_ became much greater than in Judaea itself. Although the Jews\r\nresident outside of Syria had adopted the Greek language, and were\r\ninfluenced in many ways by their contact with Hellenistic culture, they\r\nstill formed part of the religious community presided over by the High\r\nPriest at Jerusalem, and in addition to the annual contribution of two\r\ndrachmas to the temple of Jehovah, every Jew was expected to visit\r\nJerusalem and offer up sacrifice in the temple at least once in the course\r\nof his life. Moreover, they were active in proselytizing and made many\r\nconverts among the Greeks and other peoples with whom they came into\r\ncontact. However, their connection with Judaea was purely religious and\r\nnot political in character.\r\n\r\nThe privileged status which the Jews had enjoyed in the Hellenistic states\r\nwas recognized by the Romans and was specifically confirmed by Augustus,\r\nalthough this policy caused considerable dissatisfaction among their Greek\r\nfellow townsmen. Furthermore, in deference to the peculiarity of their\r\nreligion, the Jews were not required to participate in the imperial cult.\r\nHowever, the imperial government made no attempt to foster settlements of\r\nthe Jews in the western provinces, and during the early principate the\r\nonly considerable Jewish colony west of the Adriatic was that in Rome.\r\nWith the exception of Caligula, who tried to force the imperial cult upon\r\nthe Jews, the successors of Augustus did not interfere with the Jewish\r\nreligion, except to forbid its propaganda. The expulsions of the Jews from\r\nRome under Tiberius and Claudius were not religious persecutions but\r\npolice measures taken for the maintenance of good order within the city.\r\n\r\n*Christianity and Judaism.* The Christian religion had its origin in\r\nJudaea as a result of the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth, who was\r\ncrucified by the Roman authorities in the principate of Tiberius, after\r\nhaving been condemned for blasphemy by the Sanhedrin, the Jewish high\r\ncourt for the enforcement of the law of Moses. From Judaea Christianity\r\nspread to the Jewish _diaspora_ through the missionary activity of the\r\ndisciples and other followers of Jesus, particularly the Apostle Paul.\r\nAlthough the Christian propaganda was not confined to these Jewish\r\ncommunities, it was among them that the first Christian congregations\r\narose, and this, with the Jewish origin of the new faith, caused the\r\nChristians to be regarded by the Roman government as a sect of the Jews.\r\nIn 49 A. D. Claudius banished the Jews from Rome because of disorders\r\namong them between the Christians and the adherents of the older faith.\r\nNero’s persecution of the Christians in 64 A. D. was, as we have seen, not\r\nundertaken on religious grounds, and was perhaps due to Jewish\r\ninstigation. On the whole, the Christians benefited by the attitude of\r\nRome towards their sect, for it gave them the benefit of the immunities\r\nwhich the adherents of Judaism enjoyed.\r\n\r\nAlthough the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 A. D. brought about the\r\npredominance of the non-Jewish element in the Christian ranks, until the\r\nend of the rule of the Flavians the Roman official world made no\r\ndistinction between Jew and Christian. Domitian apparently exacted the\r\n_didrachma_ from both alike. Towards the close of his reign, in 95 A. D.,\r\nthis princeps executed or banished a number of Romans of senatorial rank\r\non charges of atheism or conversion to Judaism. Among the victims were\r\nsome who professed Christianity. At the same time the Christian\r\ncommunities of Asia Minor seem to have suffered a rather serious\r\npersecution on the part of the state. However, this may have been due to\r\ndisturbances between the Christian and the non-Christian elements in the\r\nGreek cities, and there is no definite proof that Domitian made the\r\nsuppression of Christianity part of the public policy.\r\n\r\n*Christianity and the Roman state.* After Domitian, Christians were no\r\nlonger liable to the _didrachma_, and therefore lost their claim to the\r\nprivileges and exemptions of the Jews. A conflict with the secular power\r\nwas rendered inevitable by the very nature of Christianity, which was\r\nnon-Roman, non-national, and monotheistic, refusing recognition to the\r\ncults of the state, and denying the divinity of the ruler. The Romans\r\nregarded the imperial cult from the political standpoint and considered\r\nthe refusal to recognize the divinity of the princeps as an act of\r\ntreason. On the other hand, Christians looked upon the question as a\r\nmatter of conscience and morality and regarded the worship of the princeps\r\nas an act of idolatry. They could pray for him, but not to him. These two\r\npoints of view were impossible of reconciliation. Furthermore, since the\r\nworship of the state gods formed such an integral part of the public life\r\nof each community, it was inevitable that those who refused to participate\r\nin this worship should be looked upon as atheists and public enemies. On\r\nanother ground also the Christians were liable to punishment under the\r\n_lex maiestatis_, namely, as forming unauthorized religious associations.\r\nThese constituted the crimes for which the Christians were actually\r\npunished from the close of the first to the middle of the third century of\r\nour era.\r\n\r\n*Popular accusations against the Christians.* However, throughout this\r\nperiod the state did not take the initiative against Christians as such,\r\nbut only dealt with those individuals against whom specific charges were\r\nlaid by private initiative or the action of local magistrates. These\r\npopular accusations charged the Christians with forming illegal\r\nassociations, with seeking the destruction of mankind (as _odiatores\r\nhumani generis_), and with perpetrating all sorts of monstrous crimes in\r\ntheir religious rites. Such accusations were partly due to the belief of\r\nthe early Christian church in the immediate coming of the kingdom of\r\nChrist, to their consequent scorn of wealth and public honors, and to the\r\nsecrecy which surrounded the exercise of their religion.\r\n\r\n*The imperial policy from Trajan to Maximus.* The attitude of the Roman\r\ngovernment towards the Christians in the early second century is clearly\r\nseen from the correspondence between Trajan and Pliny the younger, the\r\ngovernor of Bithynia in 112 A. D. This correspondence fails to reveal any\r\nspecific law prohibiting Christianity, but shows that the admission of the\r\nname of Christian, accompanied by the refusal to worship the gods of the\r\nstate and the princeps, constituted sufficient grounds for punishment.\r\nThus a great deal of discretion was left to the provincial governor, who\r\nwas directed to pay no attention to anonymous accusations but who was\r\nexpected to repress Christianity whenever its spread caused conflicts with\r\nthe non-Christian element under his authority. A rescript of Hadrian to\r\nMinucius Fundanus, proconsul of Asia, ordained that Christians should\r\nreceive the benefit of a regular trial, and that they should not be\r\ncondemned for the name, but for some definite crime, _e. g._, for treason.\r\nAn exception to the general policy of the emperors in the second century\r\nwas the persecution of the Christian community at Lyons authorized by\r\nMarcus Aurelius. With the state straining every nerve in its struggle with\r\nthe barbarians, he regarded the Christians as defaulters to the cause of\r\nthe empire, and as unreasonable, ecstatic transgressors of the law. The\r\nattitude of Septimius Severus towards the Christians was in harmony with\r\nthe procedure of Trajan and Hadrian. In 202 A. D. he ordered the governor\r\nof Syria to forbid Jewish proselytizing and Christian propaganda, but\r\nforbade that Christians should be sought out with the object of\r\npersecution. Severus Alexander showed himself well-disposed towards\r\nChristianity and the brief persecution of Maximinus the Thracian was\r\nmerely a spasmodic expression of hatred against those protected by his\r\npredecessor.\r\n\r\n*The persecutions of the third century.* By the middle of the third\r\ncentury the Christian church was in a flourishing condition. It numbered\r\namong its adherents men in all walks of life, its leaders were men of\r\nculture and ability, and abandoning the attitude of the early church\r\ntowards the Kingdom of Heaven, the Christians were taking an active part\r\nin the society in which they lived. The number of the Christians was so\r\ngreat as to disquiet the government, since in view of their attitude\r\ntowards the cults of the state they were still traitors in the eyes of the\r\nlaw. And so in their struggle against the forces which threatened the\r\ndissolution of the empire, certain of its rulers sought to stamp out\r\nChristianity as a means of restoring religious and political harmony and\r\nloyalty among their subjects. The Christians were regarded as enemies\r\nwithin the gates and the calamities of the time were attributed to the\r\nanger of the gods towards these unbelievers. In 250 A. D. Decius reversed\r\nthe principle enunciated by Septimius Severus and ordained that Christians\r\nwere to be sought out and brought to trial. This was accomplished by\r\nordering all the citizens of the empire by municipalities to perform\r\npublic acts of worship to the gods of the state. Those who refused were\r\npunished. The persecution of Decius was terminated by his death in 251,\r\nbut his policy was renewed by Valerian in 257 A. D. In that year Valerian\r\nrequired the Christians to offer sacrifice publicly, forbade their\r\nreunions and closed their cemeteries. In 258 he ordered the immediate\r\ntrial of bishops, priests and other officers of the churches, and set\r\npenalties for the various grades of the clergy who persisted in their\r\nbeliefs. But Valerian’s persecution also was brief and ended with his\r\ndefeat and capture by the Persians in 258 A. D. Naturally, in so large a\r\nbody as the Christians now were not all were animated by the zeal and\r\nsincerity of the early brethren, and under threat of punishment many, at\r\nleast openly, abjured their faith. However, many others cheerfully\r\nsuffered martyrdom and by their example furthered the Christian cause.\r\nTruly, “the blood of the martyrs was the seed of the church.” The\r\npersecutions tried the church sorely, but it emerged triumphant from the\r\nordeal.\r\n\r\n*Organization of the Christian church.* The early Christians formed a\r\nnumber of small, independent communities, united by ties of common\r\ninterest, of belief, and of continual intercourse. Although the majority\r\nof their members were drawn, from the humbler walks of life, they were by\r\nno means confined to the proletariat. In their organization these\r\ncommunities were all of the same general type, resembling the Roman\r\nreligious _collegia_, but local variations were common. Each church\r\ncommunity was directed by a committee, whose members were called at times\r\nelders (presbyters), at times overseers (bishops). These were assisted by\r\ndeacons, who, like themselves, were elected by the congregation to which\r\nthey belonged. Among the presbyters or bishops one may have acted as\r\npresident. The functions of the bishops were primarily administrative,\r\nincluding the care of the funds of the association, the care of the poor,\r\nthe friendless, and traveling brethren, and of discipline among the\r\nmembers of the community. The deacons were the subordinates of the\r\nbishops, and assisted in the religious services and the general\r\nadministration of the community.\r\n\r\nBut before the close of the principate this loose organization had been\r\ncompletely changed as a result of separatist tendencies among the\r\nChristians themselves and the increasing official oppression to which they\r\nwere exposed. The opposition to these forces resulted in a strict\r\nformulation of evangelic doctrine and a firmer organization of the church\r\ncommunities. This organization came to be centralized in the hands of the\r\nbishops, now the representatives of the communities. The episcopate was no\r\nlonger collegiate, but monarchical, and claimed authority by virtue of\r\napostolic succession. Apparently the president of the committee of bishops\r\nor presbyters had become the sole bishop, and the presbyters had become\r\npriests subject to his authority, although at times presiding over\r\nseparate congregations. The bishops were now regularly nominated by the\r\nclergy, approved by the congregation, and finally inducted into office by\r\nthe ceremony of ordination. Besides their administrative powers, the\r\nbishops had the guardianship of the traditions and doctrines of the\r\nchurch. The clergy were now salaried officers, sharply distinguished from\r\nthe laity, who gradually ceased to participate actively in the government\r\nand regulation of worship of their respective communities, and these\r\ncommunities had developed into corporations organized on a juristic basis,\r\npromising redemption to their members and withholding it from deserters.\r\n\r\n*The primacy of Rome.* In the third century, a movement took place for the\r\norganization of the separate churches in larger unions, and in this way\r\nthe provincial synods arose. In these the metropolitan bishops, that is,\r\nthose from the provincial administrative centers, assumed the leadership.\r\nAmong the churches of the empire as a whole two rival tendencies made\r\nthemselves manifest. The one was to accord equal authority to all the\r\nbishops, the other to recognize the supremacy of the bishop of Rome. The\r\nclaim for the primacy of the Roman see was based upon the imperial\r\npolitical status of Rome, and the special history of the Roman church. It\r\nwas strongly pressed by certain bishops of the second century who laid\r\nemphasis upon the claim of the Roman bishopric to have been established by\r\nthe Apostle Peter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 PART IV\r\n\r\n\r\n               THE AUTOCRACY OR LATE EMPIRE: 285–565 A. D.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n\r\n   FROM DIOCLETIAN TO THEODOSIUS THE GREAT; THE INTEGRITY OF THE EMPIRE\r\n                        MAINTAINED; 285–395 A. D.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       I. DIOCLETIAN: 285–305 A. D.\r\n\r\n\r\n*The epoch-making character of Diocletian’s reign.* Upon Diocletian\r\ndevolved the task of bringing order out of chaos, of rebuilding the\r\nshattered fabric of the Roman empire, of reëstablishing the civil\r\nadministration and taking effective measures to secure an enduring peace.\r\nLike many of the emperors of the third century, Diocletian was an Illyrian\r\nof humble origin who by sheer ability and force of character had won his\r\nway up from the ranks to the imperial throne. In attacking the problem of\r\nimperial restoration he displayed restless energy and versatility, a\r\nthorough-going radicalism which knew little respect for traditions, and a\r\nsupreme confidence in his ability to restore the economic welfare of the\r\nempire by legislative means. In his administrative reforms he gave\r\nexpression to the tendencies which had been at work in the later\r\nprincipate and with him begins the period of undisguised autocracy, in\r\nwhich the emperor, supported by the army and the bureaucracy, is the sole\r\nsource of authority in the state. Like Augustus, Diocletian was the\r\nfounder of a new régime; one in which the absolutist ideal of Julius\r\nCaesar finally attained realization.\r\n\r\n*Maximian co-emperor, 286 A. D.* One of the first acts of Diocletian was\r\nto coöpt as his associate in the _imperium_, with the rank of Caesar, a\r\nPannonian officer named Valerius Maximianus. In 286 Maximian received the\r\ntitle of Augustus and equal authority with Diocletian. However, the latter\r\nalways dominated his younger colleague, and really determined the imperial\r\npolicy. In conformity with the undisguised absolutism of his rule,\r\nDiocletian assumed the divine title of Jovius, and that of Herculius was\r\nbestowed upon Maximian. Diocletian’s choice of a co-emperor was determined\r\nlargely by the conviction that the burden of empire was too heavy to be\r\nborne by one man. He therefore entrusted the defense of the western\r\nprovinces to Maximian, while he devoted his attention to the Danubian and\r\neastern frontiers. Maximian’s first task was to quell a serious revolt of\r\nthe Gallic peasants, called Bagaudae, occasioned by the exactions of the\r\nstate and the landholders. After crushing this outbreak (285 A. D.), he\r\nsuccessfully defended the Rhine frontier against the attacks of Franks,\r\nAlamanni and Burgundians (286–88 A. D.). However, in the meantime a\r\nusurper had arisen in Carausius, an officer entrusted with the defense of\r\nthe Gallic coast against the North Sea pirates, who made himself master of\r\nBritain and proclaimed himself Augustus (286 A. D.). Maximian was unable\r\nto subdue him, and the two emperors were forced against their will to\r\nacknowledge him as their colleague.\r\n\r\n*Regulation of the succession.* Diocletian saw in the absence of a strict\r\nregulation of the succession a fertile cause of civil strife. To do away\r\nwith this, and to discourage the rise of usurpers, as well as to relieve\r\nthe Augusti of a part of their military and administrative burdens, he\r\ndetermined to appoint two Caesars as the assistants and destined\r\nsuccessors of Maximian and himself. His choice fell upon Gaius Galerius\r\nand Flavius Valerius Constantius, both Illyrian officers of tried military\r\ncapacity. They received the title of Caesar on 1 March, 293 A. D. To\r\ncement the tie between the Caesars and the Augusti, Diocletian adopted\r\nGalerius and gave him his daughter in marriage, while Maximian bound\r\nConstantius to himself in the same way. It was the plan of Diocletian that\r\nthe Augusti should voluntarily abdicate after a definite period, and be\r\nsucceeded by the Caesars, who in turn should then nominate and adopt their\r\nsuccessors.\r\n\r\n*The division of the empire.* To each of the four rulers there was\r\nassigned a part of the empire as his particular administrative sphere.\r\nDiocletian took Thrace, Egypt and the Asiatic provinces, fixing his\r\nheadquarters at Nicomedia. Maximian received Italy, Raetia, Spain and\r\nAfrica, and took up his residence at Milan. To Galerius were allotted the\r\nDanubian provinces and the remainder of the Balkan peninsula, with Sirmium\r\nas his residence; while Constantius, to whose lot fell the provinces of\r\nGaul, established himself at Trèves. However, this arrangement was not a\r\nfourfold division of the empire, for the Caesars were subject to the\r\nauthority of the Augusti, and imperial edicts were issued in the name of\r\nall four rulers. Additional unity was given to the government by the\r\npersonal ascendancy which Diocletian continued to maintain over his\r\nassociates. One result of this arrangement was that Rome ceased to be the\r\npermanent imperial residence and capital of the empire, Milan and later\r\nRavenna being preferred as the seat of government for the West. This\r\nchange was largely the result of the exclusion of the Senate from all\r\nactive participation in the government, and the fact that Rome retained\r\ntraditions of republican and senatorial rule incompatible with the spirit\r\nof the new order. Yet, in spite of its loss of prestige, the Eternal City\r\ncontinued to hold a privileged status, and its citizens were fed and\r\namused at the expense of the empire.\r\n\r\n*The restoration of the frontiers.* The division of the military authority\r\namong four able commanders enabled the government to deal energetically\r\nwith all frontier wars or internal revolts. In 296 Constantius recovered\r\nBritain from Allectus, who three years previously had overthrown Carausius\r\nand proclaimed himself Augustus. In 297 Maximian was forced to appear in\r\nperson in Africa to suppress a revolt of the Quinquegentiani. Meanwhile,\r\nDiocletian crushed a usurper named Achilles in Egypt and repulsed the\r\ninvading Blemyes. Galerius, under the orders of Diocletian, after\r\nrepelling attacks of the Iazyges (294 A. D.) and Carpi (296 A. D.), was\r\ncalled upon to meet a Persian invasion of Armenia and Mesopotamia. He was\r\nat first severely defeated, but, after being reinforced, won a decisive\r\nvictory over Narses, the Persian king, and recovered Armenia. Diocletian\r\nhimself won back Mesopotamia and the Persians were forced to acknowledge\r\nthe Roman suzerainty over Armenia, while the Roman frontier in Mesopotamia\r\nwas advanced to the upper Tigris. In all parts of the empire the border\r\ndefenses were repaired and strengthened.\r\n\r\n*Army reforms; provincial organization.* The military reforms of\r\nDiocletian aimed to correct the weakness revealed in the previous system\r\nby the wars of the third century. He created a powerful mobile force—the\r\n_comitatenses_; while organizing the permanent garrison along the frontier\r\nin the form of a border militia—the _limitanei_. At the same time, the\r\nmilitary and civil authority in the provinces was sharply divided to\r\nprevent a dangerous concentration of power in the hands of any one\r\nofficial. And the same motive is to be traced in the subdivision of the\r\nprovince, the number of which was raised to 101. These were grouped in\r\nthirteen dioceses, administered by _vicarii_ (vicars), who were\r\nsubordinate to the praetorian prefects.\r\n\r\n*The edict of prices, 301 A. D.* Diocletian also made a thorough revision\r\nof the system of taxation, and tried, but without success, to establish a\r\nsatisfactory monetary standard. A more conspicuous failure, however, was\r\nhis attempt to stabilize economic conditions by government regulation. By\r\nthe Edict of Prices issued in 301, he fixed a uniform price for each\r\ncommodity and every form of labor or professional service throughout the\r\nempire. The penalty of death was provided for all who demanded or offered\r\nmore than the legal price. The law proved impossible to enforce. It took\r\nno account of the variations of supply and demand in the various parts of\r\nthe empire, of the difference between wholesale and retail trade, or in\r\nthe quality of articles of the same kind. In spite of the severe penalty\r\nprescribed, the provisions of the law were so generally disregarded that\r\nthe government abandoned the attempt to carry them into effect.\r\n\r\n*Persecution of the Christians, 302 A. D.* Equally unsuccessful were his\r\nmeasures for the suppression of Christianity. For nearly half a century\r\nfollowing Valerian’s persecution the Christians had enjoyed immunity from\r\nrepressive legislation. They had continued to increase rapidly in numbers\r\nand it has been estimated that at this time perhaps two-fifths of the\r\npopulation of the empire were adherents of the Christian faith. The reason\r\nfor the revival of persecution by Diocletian is uncertain, although it may\r\npossibly have been at the instigation of Galerius, who displayed the\r\ngreatest zeal in carrying it into effect. In 302 Diocletian issued three\r\nedicts, ordering the confiscation of church property, the dismissal of\r\nChristians from civil offices, the abrogation of their judicial rights,\r\nthe enslavement of Christians of plebeian status, the arrest and\r\nimprisonment of the heads of the church, and heavy penalties for those who\r\nrefused to offer sacrifice to the state gods, while granting liberty to\r\nall who did so. In 304, a fourth edict ordered all citizens without\r\nexception to make public sacrifice and libation to the gods. The degree to\r\nwhich these edicts were enforced varied in the different parts of the\r\nempire. The most energetic persecutors were Maximian and Galerius, while\r\nin Gaul Constantius made little or no effort to molest the Christians. The\r\npersecution lasted with interruptions till 313 A. D. Many leading\r\nChristians met a martyr’s death, but the church emerged from the ordeal\r\nmore strongly organized and aggressive than before. Its victory made it a\r\npolitical force of supreme importance.\r\n\r\n*Abdication, 305 A. D.* On 1 May, 305 A. D., Diocletian and Maximian,\r\nafter a joint rule of twenty years, formally abdicated their authority and\r\nretired into private life. Diocletian withdrew to his palace near Salona\r\nin Dalmatia, and Maximian, much against his will, to an estate in Lucania.\r\nGalerius and Constantius succeeded them as Augusti.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               II. CONSTANTINE I, THE GREAT: 306–337 A. D.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Constantine Caesar, 306 A. D.* Diocletian’s plan for securing an orderly\r\nsuccession of rulers for the empire had neglected to take into account\r\nindividual ambitions and the strength of dynastic loyalty among the\r\nsoldiers. Its failure was forecast in the appointment of the new Caesars.\r\nGalerius, who was the more influential of the new Augusti, disregarded the\r\nclaims of Constantine, the son of Constantius, and nominated two of his\r\nown favorites, Severus and Maximinus Daia. In this Constantius acquiesced\r\nbut when he died in Britain in 306 A. D., his army acclaimed Constantine\r\nas his successor. Galerius was forced to acknowledge him as Caesar.\r\n\r\n*The revolt of Maxentius, 306 A. D.* In the same year Maxentius, the son\r\nof Maximian, took advantage of the opposition aroused in Rome by the\r\nattempt of Galerius to make the city subject to taxation, and caused\r\nhimself to be proclaimed Caesar. He was supported by his father, who\r\nemerged from his enforced retirement, and defeated and brought about the\r\ndeath of Severus, whom Galerius had made Augustus, and sent to subdue him.\r\nMaxentius then took the title of Augustus for himself. The same rank was\r\naccorded to Constantine by Maximian, who made an alliance with him and\r\ngave him his daughter, Fausta, in marriage. Upon the failure of an attempt\r\nby Galerius to overthrow Maxentius, an appeal was made to Diocletian to\r\nreturn to power and put an end to the rivalries of his successors (307\r\nA. D.). He refused to do so, but induced Maximian, who had quarrelled with\r\nhis son, to withdraw a second time from public life. Licinius, who had\r\nbeen made Caesar by Galerius in place of Severus, became an Augustus,\r\nwhile Daia and Constantine each received the title of Son of Augustus\r\n(_filius Augusti_), a distinction which Constantine, from the beginning,\r\nand Daia, soon afterwards, ignored. Thus, by 310 A. D., there were five\r\nAugusti (including Maxentius), in the empire and no Caesars. It was not\r\nlong before the ambitions of the rival emperors led to a renewal of civil\r\nwar.\r\n\r\n*The rival Augusti, 310–312 A. D.* In 310 Maximian tried to win over the\r\narmy of Constantine, but his attempt failed and cost him his life. The\r\nfollowing year Galerius died, after having, in concert with Constantine\r\nand Licinius, issued an edict which put an end to the persecution of the\r\nChristians and granted them the right to practice their religion; an\r\nadmission that the state had failed in its plan to stamp out the religion\r\nof Christ. The empire was then divided as follows: Constantine held\r\nBritain, Gaul and Raetia, Maxentius Spain, Italy and Africa, Licinius the\r\nIllyrian and Balkan provinces, and Maximinus Daia the lands to the east of\r\nthe Aegean, including Egypt. The attempt of Maxentius to add Raetia to his\r\ndominions brought him into conflict with Constantine. Constantine allied\r\nhimself with Licinius, and Maxentius found a supporter in Maximinus.\r\nWithout delay Constantine invaded Italy, and routed the troops of\r\nMaxentius at Verona. He then pressed on to Rome and won a final victory\r\nnot far from the Milvian bridge (312 A. D.). Maxentius perished in the\r\nrout. It was in this campaign, as a result of a vision, that Constantine\r\nadopted as his standard the _labarum_, a cross combined with the Christian\r\nmonogram formed of the first two letters of the Greek word _Christos_\r\n(Christ).\r\n\r\n*Constantine and Licinius, 313–324 A. D.* In 313 Constantine and Licinius\r\nmet at Milan, where they issued a joint edict of toleration, which placed\r\nChristianity upon an equal footing with the pagan cults of the state.\r\nAlthough this edict enunciated the principle of religious toleration for\r\nthe empire, it was issued with a view to win the political support of the\r\nChristians and pointed unmistakably to Christianity as the future state\r\nreligion. Shortly after the publication of the Edict of Milan, Maximinus\r\nDaia crossed the Bosphorus and invaded the territory of Licinius. He was\r\ndefeated by the latter, who followed up his advantage and occupied Asia\r\nMinor. Upon the death of Maximinus, which followed within a short time,\r\nLicinius fell heir to the remaining eastern provinces. These now received\r\nthe religious toleration previously extended to the rest of the empire.\r\n\r\nHowever, the concord between the surviving Augusti was soon broken by the\r\nambitions of Constantine, who felt aggrieved since Licinius controlled a\r\nlarger share of the empire than himself. A brief war ensued, which was\r\nterminated by an agreement whereby Licinius ceded to Constantine the\r\ndioceses of Moesia and Pannonia (314 A. D.). In 317 they jointly nominated\r\nas Caesars and their successors, Crispus and Constantine, the younger sons\r\nof Constantine, and Licinianus, the son of Licinius. However, although\r\nthey continued to act in harmony for some years longer, it was evident\r\nthat they still regarded one another with jealous suspicion. This came\r\nclearly to light in the difference of their policies towards the\r\nChristians. The more Constantine courted their support by granting them\r\nspecial privileges, the more Licinius tended to regard them with disfavor\r\nand restrict their religious liberty. Finally, in 322 A. D., when\r\nrepelling a Gothic inroad, Constantine led his forces into the territory\r\nof Licinius, who treated the trespass as an act of war. Constantine won a\r\nsignal victory at Adrianople and his son Crispus destroyed the fleet of\r\nLicinius at the Hellespont. These disasters induced Licinius to withdraw\r\nto Asia Minor. There he was completely defeated by Constantine near\r\nChrysopolis (18 September, 324 A. D.). Licinius surrendered upon assurance\r\nof his life, but the following year he was executed on a charge of\r\ntreason. Constantine was now sole emperor.\r\n\r\n*Constantine sole emperor, 324–337 A. D.* Constantine’s administrative\r\npolicy followed in the steps of Diocletian, whose organization he\r\nelaborated and perfected in many respects. The praetorian prefecture was\r\ndeprived of its military authority, which was conferred upon the\r\nnewly-created military offices of master of the horse and the foot\r\n(_magister equitum_ and _peditum_). This completed the separation between\r\nthe military and civil offices. Diocletian’s field force was strengthened\r\nby the creation of new mobile units, and his efficient army enabled\r\nConstantine to defend the empire against all barbarian attacks. Upon waste\r\nlands within the frontiers he settled Sarmatians and Vandals, while he\r\ngreatly increased the barbarian element in the army as a whole, but\r\nparticularly among the officers of higher rank.\r\n\r\n*Constantinople, 330 A. D.* Of special importance for the future history\r\nof the empire was the founding of a new capital, called Constantinople, on\r\nthe site of ancient Byzantium. After four years’ preparation, the new city\r\nwas formally dedicated on 11 May, 330 A. D. The choice of the site of the\r\nnew capital of the empire was determined by its strategic importance. It\r\nwas conveniently situated with respect to the eastern and Danubian\r\nfrontiers, and well adapted as a link between the European and Asiatic\r\nparts of the empire. The aim of the emperor was to make Constantinople a\r\nnew Rome, and he gave it the organization and the institutions of Rome on\r\nthe Tiber. A new Senate was established there; likewise the public\r\nfestivals and free bread for the populace. For the latter purpose the\r\ngrain of Egypt was diverted from Rome to Constantinople.\r\n\r\n*Constantine and the succession.* Like Diocletian, Constantine realized\r\nthe necessity of having more than a single ruler for the empire, but he\r\ndetermined to choose his associates from the members of his own household.\r\nAccordingly, following Crispus and Constantine, his younger sons,\r\nConstantius and Constans, were given the title of Caesar, while\r\nLicinianus, the son of Licinius, was gotten rid of in 326. In the same\r\nyear Crispus was also put to death. The cause of his fall is uncertain. It\r\ninvolved the death of his stepmother, Fausta, the mother of Constantine’s\r\nother sons. Ultimately, the three surviving Caesars were set over\r\napproximately equal portions of the empire. In 335 Constantine the younger\r\ngoverned Britain, Gaul and Illyricum; Constans ruled Italy, Africa and\r\nPannonia; and Constantius was in control of Asia Minor, Syria and Egypt.\r\nIn that year Constantine appointed as a fourth Caesar his nephew,\r\nDelmatius, to whom he intended to entrust the government of Thrace,\r\nMacedonia and Achaea. At the same time, Annabalianus, a brother of\r\nDelmatius, was designated as the future ruler of Pontus and Armenia, with\r\nthe title of King of Kings.\r\n\r\n*Constantine’s Christianity.* Constantine died in May, 337 A. D. shortly\r\nafter having been baptized into the Christian church. Although his mother,\r\nHelena, was a Christian, it seems improbable that Constantine himself was\r\nfrom the first an adherent of that faith. On the whole, one may say that\r\nhis attitude towards Christianity was determined largely by political\r\nrather than religious convictions. However, his mother’s influence and his\r\nfather’s toleration of Christianity doubtless predisposed him to consider\r\nthe Christians with favor. He soon sought the support of the Christians on\r\npolitical grounds, and his successes over his rivals seem to have\r\nconfirmed him in this policy. Finally, he appears to have seen in\r\nChristianity the religion best suited to a universal faith for the empire.\r\nHowever, Constantine himself did not raise Christianity to that position,\r\nalthough he prepared the way to this end. Although he forbade the\r\nperformance of private sacrifices and magical rites, in other respects he\r\nadhered faithfully to his policy of religious toleration. He took the\r\ntitle of _pontifex maximus_, maintained the imperial cult, and until 330\r\nissued coins with the image of the Sun-god, with whom the emperor was\r\noften identified. His designation of Sunday as a general holiday in 321\r\nwas in full accord with this policy of toleration, for although this was\r\nthe day celebrated by the Christians as “the Lord’s day,” as the “day of\r\nthe Sun” it could be celebrated by pagans also. Nevertheless, he exhibited\r\nan ever-increasing personal leaning towards Christianity, and granted\r\nspecial privileges to the Christian clergy. He caused his sons to be\r\nbrought up as Christians, and really established a special relation\r\nbetween the emperor and the church. For his services to the cause of\r\nChristianity he well merited the title of “the Great,” bestowed upon him\r\nby Christian historians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              III. THE DYNASTY OF CONSTANTINE: 337–363 A. D.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Constantine II, Constans and Constantius, 337–340 A. D.* Constantine’s\r\nplans for the succession were thwarted by the troops at Constantinople,\r\nwho, instigated, as was said, by Constantius, refused to acknowledge any\r\nother rulers than the sons of Constantine and put to death the rest of his\r\nrelatives, with the exception of his two youthful nephews, Gallus and\r\nJulian. Constantius and his two brothers then declared themselves Augusti\r\nand divided the empire. Constantine II received Spain, Gaul and Britain,\r\nConstantius Thrace, Egypt and the Orient, while the youngest, Constans,\r\ntook the central dioceses, Africa, Italy and Illyricum. However, this\r\narrangement endured only for a brief time. The peace was broken by\r\nConstantine, who encroached upon the territory of Constans, and affected\r\nto play the rôle of the senior Augustus. However, he was defeated and\r\nkilled at Aquileia by the troops of Constans, who annexed his dominions.\r\n\r\n*Constantius and Constans, 340–350 A. D.* The joint rule of Constantius\r\nand Constans lasted for ten years. The latter showed himself an energetic\r\nsovereign and maintained peace in the western part of the empire. At\r\nlength, however, his harshness and personal vices cost him the loyalty of\r\nhis own officers, who caused him to be deposed in favor of Magnentius, an\r\nofficer of Frankish origin (350 A. D.). And while Magnentius secured\r\nrecognition in Italy and the West, the army in Illyricum raised its\r\ncommander, Vetranio, to the purple.\r\n\r\n*Constantius sole emperor, 350–360 A. D.* From 338 A. D. Constantius had\r\nbeen engaged in an almost perpetual but indecisive struggle with Sapor II,\r\nking of Persia, over the possession of Mesopotamia and Armenia. It was not\r\nuntil late in 350 that he was able to leave the eastern frontier to\r\nattempt to reëstablish the authority of his house in the West. He soon\r\ncame to an agreement with Vetranio, who seems to have accepted the title\r\nof Augustus solely to save Illyricum from Magnentius. Vetranio passed into\r\nhonorable retirement, but when Constantius refused to recognize Magnentius\r\nas Augustus the latter marched eastwards to enforce his claims. He was\r\ndefeated in a desperate battle at Mursa in Pannonia (351 A. D.), where the\r\nvictory was won by the mailed horsemen of Constantius, who from this time\r\nonwards formed the most effective arm in the Roman service. In the next\r\nyear Constantius recovered Italy, and in 353 invaded Gaul, whereupon\r\nMagnentius took his own life.\r\n\r\n*Gallus, Caesar, 351–4 A. D.* Constantius had no son, and so to strengthen\r\nhis position, he made his cousin, Gallus, Caesar and placed him in charge\r\nof the Orient when he set out to meet Magnentius in 351 A. D. But Gallus\r\nsoon showed himself unworthy of his office. His mistreatment of the\r\nrepresentatives of the emperor sent to investigate his conduct caused him\r\nto be suspected of treasonable ambitions, and he was recalled and put to\r\ndeath in 354 A. D.\r\n\r\n*Julian, Caesar, 335 A. D.* However, Constantius still found himself in\r\nneed of an associate in the _imperium_. In addition to the danger of\r\ninvasion on both northern and eastern frontiers, came the revolt of\r\nSilvanus at Cologne in 355, which, although quickly suppressed, was a\r\nreminder that every successful general was potentially a candidate for the\r\nthrone. Accordingly, at the advice of the empress Eudoxia, he called from\r\nthe enforced seclusion of a scholar’s life Julian, the younger brother of\r\nGallus, whom he made Caesar and dispatched to Gaul (355 A. D.). Since the\r\nfall of Magnentius the Gallic provinces had been exposed to the\r\ndevastating incursions of Franks and Alemanni, and the first task of the\r\nyoung Caesar was to deal with these barbarians. In a battle near\r\nStrassburg in 357 he broke the power of the Alemanni, and drove them over\r\nthe Rhine. The Franks were forced to acknowledge Roman overlordship, but\r\nthe Salian branch of that people were allowed to settle to the south of\r\nthe Rhine (358 A. D.). In addition to displaying unexpected capacities as\r\na general, Julian showed himself a forceful and upright administrator,\r\nwhose chief aim was to revive the prosperity of his sorely-tried\r\nprovincials.\r\n\r\n*Julian, Augustus, 360 A. D.* In 359 A. D. a fresh invasion of Mesopotamia\r\nby Sapor II called Constantius to the East. The seriousness of the\r\nsituation there caused him to demand considerable reinforcements from the\r\narmy in Gaul. This was resented both by the soldiers themselves and by\r\nJulian, who saw in the order a prelude to his own undoing, for he knew the\r\nsuspicious nature of his cousin, and was aware that his own successes and\r\nthe restraint he imposed upon the rapacity of his officials had aroused\r\nthe enmity of those who had the emperor’s confidence. However, after a\r\nvain protest, he yielded; but the troops took matters into their own\r\nhands, mutinied and hailed Julian as Augustus. His ambitions, which had\r\nbeen awakened by the taste of power, and the precariousness of his present\r\nsituation led him to accept the title (360 A. D.). He then sought to\r\nobtain from Constantius recognition of his position and the cession of the\r\nwestern provinces. The latter rejected his demand, although he did not\r\ndeem it advisable to leave the East unprotected at that moment and attempt\r\nto reassert his authority. Julian then took the offensive to enforce his\r\nclaims, and, upon the retirement of the Persian army, Constantius hastened\r\nto meet him. But on the march he fell ill and died in Cilicia, having\r\ndesignated Julian as his successor.\r\n\r\n*The pagan reaction.* The importance of Julian’s reign lies in his attempt\r\nto make paganism once more the dominant religion of the empire. His own\r\nearly saturation with the fascinating literature of Hellenism and the\r\nmystical strain in his character made Julian an easy convert to\r\nNeo-platonism. He had become a pagan in secret before he had been called\r\nto the Caesarship, and after the death of Constantius openly proclaimed\r\nhis apostacy. While he adhered in general to the principle of religious\r\ntoleration and did not institute any systematic persecution of the\r\nChristians, he prohibited them from interpreting classical literature in\r\nthe schools, forced them to surrender many pagan shrines which they had\r\noccupied, deprived the clergy of their immunities, endeavored to sow\r\ndissension in their ranks by supporting unorthodox bishops, and stimulated\r\na literary warfare against them in which he himself took a prominent part.\r\nFollowing the example of Maximinus Daia, Julian attempted to combat\r\nChristianity with its own weapons, and tried to establish a universal\r\npagan church with a clergy and liturgy on the Christian model. He also\r\nsought to infuse paganism with the morality and missionary zeal of\r\nChristianity. But his efforts were in vain; the pagan cults had lost their\r\nappeal for the masses, and the only converts were those who sought to win\r\nthe imperial favor by abandoning the Christian faith.\r\n\r\n*Persian war and death, 363 A. D.* In his administration of the empire\r\nJulian pursued the same policy as in Gaul. He checked the greed of\r\ngovernment officials, abolished oppressive offices, and in every way tried\r\nto restrain extravagances and lighten the burdens of his subjects. The war\r\nwith Persia which had begun under Constantius had not been concluded and\r\nJulian was fired by the ambition to imitate the career of Alexander the\r\nGreat and overthrow the Persian kingdom. After long preparations he began\r\nhis attack early in 363 A. D. He succeeded in reaching Ctesiphon where he\r\ndefeated a Persian army. But his attempt to penetrate further into the\r\nenemy’s country failed for want of supplies, and he was forced to begin a\r\nretreat. On the march up the Tigris valley he was mortally wounded in a\r\nskirmish (26 June, 363 A. D.), and with his death ended the rule of the\r\ndynasty of Constantine the Great.\r\n\r\n*Jovian, 363–4 A. D.* The army chose as his successor Jovian, the\r\ncommander of the imperial guard. To rescue his forces, Jovian made peace\r\nwith Sapor, surrendering the Roman territory east of the Tigris, with part\r\nof Mesopotamia, and abandoning the Roman claim to suzerainty over Armenia.\r\nJulian’s enactments against the Christians were abrogated and religious\r\ntoleration proclaimed. After a brief reign of eight months, Jovian died at\r\nAntioch in 364 A. D.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   IV. THE HOUSE OF VALENTINIAN AND THEODOSIUS THE GREAT: 364–395 A. D.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Valentinian I and Valens, Augusti, 364 A. D.* At the death of Jovian the\r\nchoice of the military and civil officials fell upon Flavius\r\nValentinianus, an officer of Pannonian origin. He nominated as his\r\nco-ruler his brother, Valens, whom he set over the East, reserving the\r\nWest for himself.\r\n\r\nValentinian’s reign was an unceasing struggle to protect the western\r\nprovinces against barbarian invaders. The emperor personally directed the\r\ndefense of the Rhine and Danubian frontiers against the incursions of the\r\nAlemanni, Quadi and Sarmatians, while his able general Theodosius cleared\r\nBritain of Picts, Scots and Saxons, and suppressed a dangerous revolt of\r\nthe Moors in Africa. In 375 Valentinian died at Brigetio in the course of\r\na war with the Sarmatians. Although imperious and prone to violent\r\noutbursts of temper, he had shown himself tireless in his efforts to\r\nprotect the empire from foreign foes and his subjects from official\r\noppression. In this latter aim, however, he was frequently thwarted by the\r\nintrigues of his own officers.\r\n\r\n*Gratian and Valentinian II.* As early as 367 Valentinian had appointed as\r\na third Augustus his eldest son, Gratian, then only seven years old. The\r\nlatter now succeeded to the government of the West, although the army also\r\nacclaimed as emperor his four-year-old brother, Valentinian II.\r\n\r\n*The Gothic invasion, 376 A. D.* Meanwhile Valens, who exercised the\r\nimperial power in the East, had been involved in protracted struggles with\r\nthe Goths along the lower Danube and with the Persians, whose attempt to\r\nconvert Armenia into a Persian province constituted a threat too dangerous\r\nto be ignored. Peace had been established with the Goths in 369, but in\r\n376 new and unexpected developments brought them again into conflict with\r\nthe Romans.\r\n\r\nThe cause lay in the westward movement of the Huns, a nomadic race of\r\nMongolian origin, whose appearance in the regions to the north of the\r\nBlack Sea marks the beginning of the period of the great migrations. In\r\n375 A. D. they overwhelmed the Greuthungi, or East Goths, and assailed the\r\nThervingi, or West Goths. Unable to defend themselves, the latter in 376\r\nsought permission to settle on Roman territory to the south of the Danube.\r\nValens acceded to their request upon the condition of their giving up\r\ntheir weapons. The reception and settlement of the Goths was entrusted to\r\nRoman officers who neglected to enforce the surrender of their arms, while\r\nthey enriched themselves by extorting high prices from the immigrants for\r\nthe necessities of life. Thereupon, threatened by starvation, the Goths\r\nrebelled, defeated the Romans, and began to plunder the country (377\r\nA. D.). The news of this peril summoned Valens from the East, but Gratian\r\nwas hindered from coming to the rescue by an incursion of the Alemanni\r\ninto Gaul. However, as soon as he had defeated the invaders he hastened to\r\nthe assistance of his uncle. Without awaiting his arrival, Valens rashly\r\nattacked the Goths at Hadrianople. His army was cut to pieces, he himself\r\nslain, and Goths overran the whole Balkan peninsula (378 A. D.).\r\n\r\n*Theodosius I, the Great, 378 A. D.* To meet this crisis, Gratian\r\nappointed as Augustus, Theodosius, the son of the Theodosius who had\r\ndistinguished himself as a general under Valentinian I, but who had fallen\r\na victim to official intrigues at the latter’s death. The new emperor\r\nundertook with vigor the task of clearing Thrace and the adjoining\r\nprovinces of the plundering hordes of Goths. By 382 he had forced them to\r\nsue for peace and had settled them on waste lands to the south of the\r\nDanube. There they remained as an independent people under their native\r\nrulers, bound, however, to supply contingents to the Roman armies in\r\nreturn for fixed subsidies. They thus became imperial _foederati_.\r\n\r\n*The revolt of Arbogast and Eugenius, 392 A. D.* In 391 Theodosius reduced\r\nthe Goths to submission when a revolt of the troops in Britain raised\r\nMagnus Maximus to the purple. Gratian had shown himself a feeble\r\nadministrator and had alienated the sympathies of the bulk of his troops\r\nby his partiality towards the Germans in his service. Maximus at once\r\ncrossed into Gaul and was confronted by Gratian at Paris. But the latter\r\nwas deserted by his army, and was captured and put to death. The authority\r\nof Maximus was now firmly established in Britain, Gaul and Spain. He\r\ndemanded and received recognition from Theodosius, who was prevented from\r\navenging Gratian’s death by threatening conditions in the East. The third\r\nAugustus, the young Valentinian II, acquired for the time an independent\r\nsphere of authority in Italy. However, in 387 A. D. Maximus suddenly\r\ncrossed the Alps and forced him to take refuge with Theodosius. Having\r\ncome to terms with Persia, Theodosius refused to sanction the action of\r\nMaximus and marched against him. The troops of Maximus were defeated, and\r\nhe himself captured and executed at Aquileia (388 A. D.). Gaul and the\r\nWest were speedily recovered for Theodosius by his general, Arbogast.\r\n\r\n*Theodosius and Ambrose.* While Theodosius was at Milan in 390 occurred\r\nhis famous conflict with Bishop Ambrose. In a riot at Thessalonica the\r\ncommander of the garrison had been killed by the mob, and Theodosius, in\r\nhis anger, had turned loose the soldiery upon the citizens, of whom seven\r\nthousand are said to have been butchered. Scarcely had Theodosius issued\r\nthe order when he was seized with regret, and endeavored to countermand\r\nit; but it was too late. Upon the news of the massacre, Ambrose excluded\r\nthe emperor from his church and refused to admit him to communion until he\r\nhad publicly done penance for his sin. For eight months Theodosius refused\r\nto yield, but Ambrose remained obdurate, and the emperor finally humbled\r\nhimself and publicly acknowledged his guilt. The question at issue was not\r\nthe supremacy of secular or religious authority, but whether the emperor\r\nwas subject to the same moral laws as other men. Nevertheless, it required\r\na high degree of courage for the bishop to assert the right of the church\r\nto pass judgment in such a matter upon the head of the state.\r\n\r\n*The revolt of Arbogast and Eugenius, 392 A. D.* In 391 Theodosius\r\nreturned to the East, leaving Valentinian as emperor in the West with his\r\nresidence at Vienna in Gaul. But the powerful Arbogast, whom Theodosius\r\nhad placed in command of the western troops, refused to act under the\r\norders of the young Augustus, and finally compassed his death (392 A. D.).\r\nHowever, he did not dare, in view of his Frankish origin, to assume the\r\npurple himself, and so induced a prominent Roman official named Eugenius\r\nto accept the title of Augustus. The authority of Eugenius was\r\nacknowledged in Italy and all the West, but Theodosius refused him\r\nrecognition and prepared to crush the usurper. In the autumn of 394 A. D.,\r\nat the river Frigidus, near Aquileia, Theodosius won a complete victory\r\nover Arbogast and Eugenius. The former committed suicide and the latter\r\nwas put to death.\r\n\r\nEarly in the next year Theodosius died, leaving the empire to his two\r\nsons, Arcadius and Honorius, upon both of whom he had previously conferred\r\nthe rank of Augustus. The success of Theodosius in coping with the Gothic\r\nperil and in suppressing the usurpers Maximus and Eugenius, combined with\r\nhis vigorous championship of orthodox Christianity, won for him the title\r\nof the “Great.” With the accession of Arcadius and Honorius and the\r\npermanent division of the empire into an eastern and a western half, there\r\nbegins a new epoch of Roman history.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: The Roman Empire in 395 A. D.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n\r\n               THE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION OF THE LATE EMPIRE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      I. THE AUTOCRAT AND HIS COURT\r\n\r\n\r\n*Powers and titles of the emperor.* The government of the late Roman\r\nempire was an autocracy, in which the emperor was the active head of the\r\nadministration and at the same time the source of all legislative,\r\njudicial and military authority. For the exercise of this authority the\r\nsupport of the army and the bureaucracy was essential. All the sovereign\r\nrights of the Roman people were regarded as having been transferred to the\r\nimperial power. The emperor was no longer the First of the Roman\r\ncitizens—the _primus inter pares_—but all within the empire were in equal\r\ndegree his subjects. This view of the exalted status of the emperor was\r\nexpressed in the assumption of the divine titles Jovius and Herculius by\r\nDiocletian and Maximian. Their Christian successors, although for the\r\ngreater part of the fourth century they accepted deification from their\r\npagan subjects, found a new basis for their absolutism in the conception\r\nof the emperor as the elect of God, who ruled by divine guidance. Thus the\r\nemperor could speak of the _imperium_ which had been conferred upon him by\r\nthe heavenly majesty. The adjectives “sacred” and “divine” were applied\r\nnot only to the emperor’s person but also to everything that in any way\r\nbelonged to him, and the “imperial divinity” was an expression in common\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nAs the sole author of the laws, the emperor was also their final\r\ninterpreter; and since he acted under divine guidance those who questioned\r\nhis decisions, and those who neglected or transgressed his ordinances,\r\nwere both alike guilty of sacrilege. The emperor was held to be freed from\r\nthe laws in the sense that he was not responsible for his legislative and\r\nadministrative acts, yet he was bound by the laws in that he had to adhere\r\nto the general principles and forms of the established law of the state,\r\nand had to abide by his own edicts, for the imperial authority rested upon\r\nthe authority of the laws.\r\n\r\nThe titles of the emperor bore witness to his autocratic power. From the\r\nprincipate he had inherited those of Imperator, the significance of which\r\nwas revealed in its Greek rendering of Autocrator, and Augustus, which was\r\nas well suited to the new as to the old position of the emperor. More\r\nstriking, however, was the use of _dominus_ or _dominus noster_, a title\r\nwhich, as we have seen, was but rarely used during the principate, but\r\nwhich was officially prescribed by Diocletian. The term princeps, although\r\nit has long lost its original significance, still continued to be employed\r\nin official documents, at times in conjunction with _dominus_.\r\n\r\n*Imperial regalia.* The imperial regalia likewise expressed the emperor’s\r\nautocratic power. With Diocletian the military garb of the principate was\r\ndiscarded for a robe of silk interwoven with gold and Constantine I\r\nintroduced the use of the diadem, a narrow band ornamented with jewels,\r\nwhich formed part of the insignia of the Persian monarchs, and was\r\nsymbolic of absolutism in the ancient world.\r\n\r\n*The succession.* We have seen how the scheme devised by Diocletian for\r\nregulating the succession to the throne broke down after his retirement.\r\nHis successors refused to abdicate their imperial authority and only\r\nsurrendered it with life itself. In the appointment of new emperors two\r\nprinciples found recognition—election and coöptation. The system of\r\nelection was a legacy from the principate, and recourse was regularly had\r\nto it when the imperial throne was vacant. The elected emperor was usually\r\nthe choice of the leading military and civil officials, approved by the\r\narmy. In Constantinople, from the fifth century at least, the nomination\r\nwas made by these officers in conjunction with the reorganized senate, and\r\nthe new emperor was proclaimed before the people assembled in the\r\nHippodrome. The emperors thus appointed claimed to have been elected by\r\nthe officials, the Senate, and the army with the sanction of the people.\r\nHowever, as the history of the time shows, the right of election might be\r\nexercised at any time, and a victorious usurper became a legal ruler. Thus\r\nthe autocracy, as has been aptly remarked, was tempered by a legal right\r\nof revolution. As this method of election guaranteed a high average of\r\nability among emperors, so the custom of coöptation gave opportunity to\r\nadmit the claim of dynastic succession. An Augustus could appoint as his\r\ncolleague the one whom he wished to succeed him on the throne. However, it\r\nis to be noted that a son who was thus elevated to the purple became\r\nemperor by virtue of his father’s will and not by the right of birth.\r\n\r\n*The imperial court.* Under Diocletian the organization and ceremonial of\r\nthe imperial palace were thoroughly remodelled. The servants of the\r\nhousehold—ushers, chamberlains, grooms and the like—were now formed into\r\ncorps on a military basis, with a definite regulation of insignia, pay,\r\nterm of service and promotion. In harmony with the general spirit of the\r\nautocracy, the court ceremonial was designed to widen the gulf between the\r\nruler and his subjects and to protect his person by rendering it\r\ninaccessible. Surrounded by all the pomp and pageantry of an oriental\r\npotentate, the Roman emperor was removed from contact with all but his\r\nimmediate _entourage_. The effect of this seclusion was to enhance the\r\npower of the few who were permitted to come into touch with him, in\r\nparticular the officials of the imperial household. The personal servants\r\nof the emperor were placed on the same level as the public administrative\r\nofficers, and the most important of them, the grand chamberlain, before\r\nthe close of the fourth century had become one of the great ministers of\r\nstate, with a seat in the imperial cabinet. In conformity with the\r\nassumption of the title _dominus_ and of the diadem, was the requirement\r\nof prostration from all who were admitted to an audience with the emperor.\r\nIn addition to its civilian employees, the palace had its special armed\r\nguard. These household troops were the scholarians, organized by\r\nConstantine I when he disbanded the praetorian guards who had upheld the\r\ncause of Maxentius.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      II. THE MILITARY ORGANIZATION\r\n\r\n\r\n*General characteristics.* The chief characteristics of the military\r\norganization of the late empire were the complete separation of civil and\r\nmilitary authority except in the person of the emperor, the sharp\r\ndistinction between the mobile forces and the frontier garrisons, and the\r\never-increasing predominance of the barbarian element, not merely in the\r\nrank and file of the soldiers, but also among the officers of highest\r\nrank.\r\n\r\n*The limitanei.* The troops composing the frontier garrisons were called\r\n_limitanei_, or borderers; also, when stationed along a river frontier,\r\n_riparienses_. They were the successors of the garrison army of the\r\nprincipate and were distributed among small fortified posts (_castella_).\r\nTo each of these garrisons there was assigned for purposes of cultivation\r\na tract of land free from municipal authority. These lands were exempt\r\nfrom taxation, and, although they were not alienable, the right to occupy\r\nthem passed from father to son with the obligation to military service.\r\nThus the _limitanei_ were practically a border militia. Their numbers were\r\nmaterially increased by Diocletian but reduced again by Constantine I who\r\ntransferred their best units to the field army. The _limitanei_ ranked\r\nbelow the field troops; their physical standards were lower, and their\r\nrewards at the end of their term of service inferior.\r\n\r\n*The palatini and comitatenses.* To remedy the greatest weakness in the\r\narmy of the principate, namely, its lack of mobility, Diocletian formed a\r\npermanent field force to accompany the emperor on his campaigns, for it\r\nwas his intention that the emperors should personally lead their armies.\r\nSince the field troops thus formed the _comitatus_, or escort, of the\r\nemperor they received the name of _comitatenses_. Later certain units of\r\nthe _comitatenses_ were called _palatini_, or palace troops, a purely\r\nhonorary distinction. The _palatini_ and _comitatenses_ were stationed at\r\nstrategic points well within the frontiers.\r\n\r\n*Numbers.* In both the garrison and field armies the old legion was broken\r\nup into smaller detachments, to each of which the name legion was given.\r\nThey still continued to be recruited from Romans, but were regarded as\r\ninferior in caliber to the _auxilia_, the light infantry corps which were\r\nlargely drawn from barbarian volunteers. A great number of new cavalry\r\nunits were formed, so that the proportion of cavalry to infantry was\r\nlargely increased. At the opening of the fifth century the troops\r\nstationed in Spain, in the Danubian provinces, in the Orient and in Egypt\r\nhad a nominal strength of 554,500 of which 360,000 were _limitanei_ and\r\n194,500 field troops. However, it is extremely doubtful if the separate\r\ndetachments were maintained at their full numbers. The scholarians,\r\norganized as an imperial bodyguard by Constantine I, numbered 3500. They\r\nwere divided into seven companies called _scholae_, from the fact that a\r\nparticular _schola_, or waiting hall in the palace, was assigned to each.\r\n\r\n*Recruitment.* In the late empire the ranks of the Roman army stood open\r\nto all free men who possessed the requisite physical qualifications.\r\nSlaves were also enrolled from the fifth century onwards but their\r\nadmission to military service brought them freedom. Recruits were either\r\nvolunteers or conscripts. The universal liability to service existed until\r\nthe time of Valentinian I, although in practice it was limited to the\r\nmunicipal plebs and the agricultural classes. Valentinian placed the\r\nobligation to furnish a specified number of recruits upon the landholders\r\nof certain provinces, and levied a corresponding monetary tax upon the\r\nother provinces. He also made it obligatory for the sons of soldiers to\r\npresent themselves for service. Many barbarian peoples, settled within the\r\nempire, were likewise under an obligation to furnish a yearly number of\r\nrecruits, who, however, were regarded as volunteers. Still voluntary\r\nrecruitment was the rule under the late empire even more than under the\r\nprincipate, and the majority of the volunteers for military service were\r\nof barbarian origin. Corps of all sorts were named after barbarian\r\npeoples, and while barbarian officers received Roman citizenship, the rank\r\nand file remained aliens.\r\n\r\n*Discipline.* The chief reason for the victories of the Roman armies of\r\nthe early principate over their barbarian foes lay in their superior\r\ndiscipline and organization. And the burden of maintaining this discipline\r\nhad rested upon the junior officers or centurions who came from the\r\nsenatorial order of the Roman municipalities. By the end of the third\r\ncentury the centuriate had disappeared for lack of volunteers of this\r\nclass and with its disappearance began a decline in discipline and\r\ntraining. The construction of the fortified camp was no longer required,\r\nthe soldier’s heavy pack was discarded, and before the close of the fourth\r\ncentury the burdensome defensive armor was also given up. In equipment and\r\ntactics the Roman troops of the late empire were on a level with their\r\nbarbarian opponents. Just as the Roman empire was unable to assimilate the\r\nbarbarian settlers within its frontiers, so the Roman army proved unable\r\nto absorb the barbarian elements within its ranks.\r\n\r\n*Foederati.* The decline in efficiency of the Roman troops and the\r\nconfessed inability of the state to deal with its military obligations led\r\nto the taking into the Roman pay of warlike peoples along the Roman\r\nfrontiers. Such peoples were called federated allies (_foederati_), and\r\nguaranteed to protect the territory of the empire in return for a\r\nstipulated remuneration in money or supplies. Such were the terms upon\r\nwhich the Goths were granted lands south of the Danube by Theodosius the\r\nGreat. But in this case, as in others, it is hard to distinguish between\r\nsubsidies paid to _foederati_ and the payments made by many emperors to\r\npurchase immunity from invasion by dangerous neighbors. A danger inherent\r\nin the system was that the _foederati_ might at any moment turn their arms\r\nagainst their employers. Retaining as they did their political autonomy\r\nand serving under their own chiefs, the _foederati_ were not regarded as\r\nforming a part of the imperial forces.\r\n\r\n*The duces and the magistri militum.* We have already referred to the\r\ncomplete separation of military and civil authority. This was carried out\r\nas far as the border troops were concerned by Diocletian. He divided the\r\nfrontiers into military districts which corresponded to the provinces and\r\nplaced the garrisons in each under an officer with the title of _dux_. The\r\n_duces_ of highest rank were regularly known as _comites_ (counts). Under\r\nDiocletian the praetorian prefects remained the highest military officers,\r\nand were in command of the field army. As we have seen, Constantine I\r\ndeprived the praetorian prefecture of its military functions and appointed\r\ntwo new commanders-in-chief—the master of the foot (_magister peditum_)\r\nand the master of the horse (_magister equitum_). Under the successors of\r\nConstantine these offices were increased in number and the distinction\r\nbetween infantry and cavalry commands was abandoned. Consequently, the\r\ntitles of master of the horse and master of the foot were altered to those\r\nof masters of horse and foot, masters of each service, or masters of the\r\nsoldiers. In the East by the close of the fourth century there were two\r\nmasters of the soldiers at Constantinople, each commanding half of the\r\npalatini in the vicinity of the capital, and three others commanding the\r\n_comitatenses_ in the Orient, Thrace and Illyricum, respectively. In the\r\nWest there were two masterships at the court, and a master of the horse in\r\nthe diocese of Gaul.\r\n\r\nBut while in the East the several masters of the soldiers enjoyed\r\nindependent commands, in the West by 395 A. D. there had developed a\r\nconcentration of the supreme military power in the hands of one master,\r\nwho united in his person the two masterships at the court. The master in\r\nGaul, with the _duces_ and _comites_ in the provinces were under his\r\norders. This subordination was emphasized by the fact that the heads of\r\nthe office staff (_principes_) of the _comites_ and _duces_ were appointed\r\nby the master at the court. On the other hand, in the East, these\r\n_principes_ were appointed by a civil official, the master of the offices,\r\nwho was also charged with the inspection of the frontier defences, and\r\nfrom the opening of the fifth century exercised judicial authority over\r\nthe _duces_. The latter, however, remained the military subordinates of\r\nthe masters of the soldiers. Thus the concentration of military power in\r\nthe West in the hands of a single commander-in-chief prepared the way for\r\nthe rise of the king-makers of the fifth century, while the division of\r\nthe higher command in the East prevented a single general from completely\r\ndominating the political situation.\r\n\r\n*Judicial status of the soldiers.* Characteristic of the times was the\r\nremoval of soldiers from the jurisdiction of the civil authority. In the\r\nfourth century they could only be prosecuted on criminal charges in the\r\ncourts of their military commanders, and in the fifth century they were\r\ngranted this privilege in civil cases also.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  III. THE PERFECTION OF THE BUREAUCRACY\r\n\r\n\r\n*The administrative divisions of the empire.* The administrative machinery\r\nof the late empire was simply an outgrowth from, and a more complete form\r\nof, the bureaucracy which had developed under the principate. All the\r\nofficers of the state were now servants of the emperor, appointed by him\r\nand dismissed at his pleasure. At the basis of the administrative\r\norganization lay the division of the empire into prefectures, dioceses and\r\nprovinces. By the close of the fourth century there were one hundred and\r\ntwenty provinces, grouped into fourteen dioceses, which made up the four\r\nprefectures of Gaul, Italy, Illyricum and the Orient.(17) This division of\r\nthe empire into four prefectures was carried out under Constans and\r\nConstantius. Until the death of Constantine I, the pretorian prefecture\r\nhad remained an office associated with the person of the emperor, and from\r\nthe time of Diocletian the number of praetorian prefects had corresponded\r\nto the number of Augusti, each emperor appointing one for his own part of\r\nthe empire. This practice was followed by the sons of Constantine. But\r\nafter Constans had overthrown Constantine II he left the latter’s\r\nterritory under the administration of a special prefect, thus establishing\r\nthe prefecture of Gaul. He afterwards appointed another prefect for\r\nIllyricum, which was separated from the jurisdiction of the prefect of\r\nItaly. When Constantius became sole emperor in 351, he retained the three\r\nprefectures of Constans, and his own previous dominions constituted the\r\nfourth, that of the Orient. In 379, Gratian, the emperor in the West,\r\ntransferred the Illyrian prefecture from his sphere to that of Theodosius,\r\nhis colleague in the East.\r\n\r\n*The praetorian prefects and their subordinates.* Each province had a\r\ncivil governor, variously known as proconsul, consular, _corrector_ or\r\n_praeses_, according to the relative importance of his governorship. The\r\nprovincial governors, with a few exceptions, were subject to the vicars,\r\nwho were in charge of the several dioceses, and who, in turn, were under\r\nthe administrative control of the four praetorian prefects, the heads of\r\nthe prefectures. The prefects and their subordinates were in charge of the\r\nraising of taxes paid in kind and of the administration of justice for the\r\nprovincials. Italy was now divided into several provinces and Italian soil\r\nwas no longer exempt from taxation. With the exception of the population\r\nof Rome, the inhabitants of Italy were upon the same footing as those of\r\nthe other provinces, with whom they shared the name of provincials.\r\n\r\n*The central administrative bureaus.* The remaining branches of the civil\r\nadministration were directed by a group of ministers resident at the\r\ncourt, with subordinates in the various administrative departments. These\r\nministers were the master of the offices, the quaestor, the count of the\r\nsacred largesses and the count of the private purse. The master of the\r\noffices united in his hands the control of the secretarial bureaus of the\r\npalace, the oversight over the public post, the direction of the\r\n_agentes-in-rebus_, who constituted the imperial secret service, the\r\ncommand of the scholarians, the supervision of several branches of the\r\npalace administration, and jurisdiction over practically all of the\r\npersonal servants of the emperor. As we have seen, in the East he also\r\nexercised certain authority over the _duces_. The quaestor (to be\r\ndistinguished from the holders of the urban quaestorships) was a minister\r\nof justice, part of whose duties consisted in the preparation of imperial\r\nlegislation. The count of the sacred largesses was the successor to the\r\n_rationalis_, who had been in charge of the imperial fiscus under the\r\nprincipate. He was charged with the collection and disbursement of the\r\npublic revenues which were paid in money, and his title was derived from\r\nthe fact that the funds under his control were used for the imperial\r\ndonations or largesses. He likewise had the supervision of the imperial\r\nfactories engaged in the manufacture of silks, and other textiles. The\r\ncount of the private purse was the head of the department of the _res\r\nprivata_ and in charge of the revenues from the imperial domains. These\r\nministers with certain other administrative officials of the court and the\r\nchief officers of the imperial household, such as the grand chamberlain,\r\nwere known as the palace dignitaries (_dignitates palatinae_).\r\n\r\nRome and Constantinople were exempt from the authority of the praetorian\r\nprefects, and were each administered by a city prefect. Two consuls were\r\nnominated annually, one at Rome and one at Constantinople, and gave their\r\nnames to the official year, but their duties were limited to furnishing\r\ncertain entertainments for the populace of the capitals. This was also the\r\nsole function of the praetorship and quaestorship, which were now filled\r\nby imperial appointment upon the recommendation of the city prefects.\r\n\r\n*The imperial council of state.* The system of graded subordination, which\r\nplaced the lower officials in each department under the orders of those\r\nhaving wider powers, brought about the ultimate concentration of the civil\r\nand military administration in the hands of about twenty officers who were\r\ndirectly in touch with the emperor and responsible to him alone. From\r\nthese were drawn the members of the council of state or imperial\r\nconsistory (so-called from the obligation to remain standing in the\r\npresence of the emperor). Permanent members of this council were the four\r\nministers of the court mentioned above, who were known as the counts of\r\nthe consistory, and also the grand chamberlain.\r\n\r\n*The officia.* The officials who were at the head of administrative\r\ndepartments, civil or military, had at their disposal an _officium_ or\r\nbureau, the members of which were known as _officiales_. These subaltern\r\nemployees of the state were free men, no longer slaves or freedmen like\r\ntheir predecessors of the principate. As in the case of the palace\r\nservants their numbers, terms of service (_militia_), promotion and\r\ndischarge were fixed by imperial edicts, and they were not placed at the\r\nmercy of the functionary whose office staff they formed. Indeed, owing to\r\nthe permanent character of the organization of the _officia_, the burden\r\nof the routine administration fell upon their members, and not upon their\r\ntemporary director, for whose acts they were made to share the\r\nresponsibility. This was particularly true of the bureau chief\r\n(_princeps_), who was regularly appointed from the _agentes-in-rebus_ as a\r\nspy upon the actions of his superior. Like the soldiers, the civil service\r\nemployees enjoyed exemption from the ordinary courts of justice and the\r\nprivilege of defending themselves in the courts of the chief of that\r\nbranch of the administration to which they were attached.\r\n\r\n*Official corruption.* The attitude of the emperor towards his chief\r\nservants was marked by mistrust and suspicion. The policy which led to the\r\nattempt to weaken the more powerful offices by the separation of civil and\r\nmilitary authority and by the subdivision of the administrative districts\r\nwas adhered to in the provisions for direct communication between the\r\nemperor and the subordinates of the great ministers, and the highly\r\ndeveloped system of state espionage whereby the ruler kept watch upon the\r\nactions of his officers. However, in spite of the efforts of the majority\r\nof the emperors to secure an honest and efficient administration, the\r\nactual result of the development of this elaborate bureaucratic system was\r\nthe erection of an almost impassable barrier between the emperor and his\r\nsubjects. Neither did their complaints reach his ears, nor were his\r\nordinances for their relief effective, because the officials coöperated\r\nwith one another to conceal their misdemeanors and to enrich themselves at\r\nthe expense of the civilian population. So thoroughly had the spirit of\r\n“graft” and intrigue penetrated all ranks of the civil and military\r\nservice that to gratify their personal ambitions they were even willing to\r\ncompromise the safety of the empire itself. The burden imposed upon the\r\ntax payers by the vast military and civil establishment was immensely\r\naggravated by the extortions practised by representatives of both\r\nservices, whose rapacity knew no bounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     IV. THE NOBILITY AND THE SENATE\r\n\r\n\r\n*The senatorial order.* The conflict between the principate and the Senate\r\nresulted, as we have seen, in the exclusion of members of the senatorial\r\norder from all offices of state. But it was unthinkable that the great\r\nlanded proprietors should be permanently shut out of the public service,\r\nand with the loss of any claim to authority by the Senate as a body there\r\nwas no longer any objection to their entering the service of the emperor.\r\nConsequently, the essential distinction between the senatorial and\r\nequestrian orders vanished and a new senatorial order arose into which was\r\nmerged a large equestrian element.\r\n\r\n*The clarissimate.* The distinguishing mark of this new senatorial order\r\nwas the right to the title _clarissimus_, which might be acquired by\r\ninheritance, by imperial grant, or by the attainment of an office which\r\nconferred the clarissimate upon its holder, either during his term of\r\nservice or upon his retirement. Practically all of the higher officials in\r\nthe imperial service were _clarissimi_ and there was consequently a great\r\nincrease in the number of senators in the course of the fourth century.\r\nThe place of the equestrian order was in part filled by the\r\nperfectissimate, an inferior order of rank conferred upon lower imperial\r\nofficials and municipal senators.\r\n\r\n*The higher orders of rank.* The development of an oriental court life\r\nwith its elaborate ceremonial demanding a fixed order of precedence among\r\nthose present at imperial audiences, and the increase in the number and\r\nimportance of the public officials, which necessitated a classification of\r\nthe various official posts from the point of view of rank, led to the\r\nestablishment of new and more exclusive rank classes within the circle of\r\nthe _clarissimi_. There were in the ascending order the _spectabiles_, or\r\nRespectables, and the _illustres_, or Illustrious. The illustriate was\r\nconferred solely upon the great ministers of state. Under Justinian, in\r\nthe sixth century, there was established the still higher order of the\r\n_gloriosi_ (the Glorious). The official positions, to which these titles\r\nof rank were attached, were called dignities (_dignitates_), and the great\r\ndemand for admission to these rank classes, which entitled their members\r\nto valuable privileges, caused the conferment of many honorary dignities,\r\ni. e., titles of official posts with their appropriate rank but without\r\nthe duties of office.\r\n\r\n*The patricians and counts.* The other titles of nobility were those of\r\npatrician and count. The former, created by Constantine I in imitation of\r\nthe older patrician order, was granted solely to the highest dignitaries,\r\nalthough it was not attached to any definite official post. It was\r\nConstantine also who revived the _comitiva_, which had been used\r\nirregularly of the chief associates of the princeps until the death of\r\nSeverus Alexander, and put it to a new use. The term count became a title\r\nof honor definitely attached to certain offices, but also capable of being\r\nconferred as a favor or a reward of merit. Like the other titles of rank\r\nthe patriciate and the _comitiva_ brought with them not only precedence\r\nbut also valuable immunities.\r\n\r\nNothing illustrates more clearly the importance of official positions than\r\nthe division of the people of the empire as a whole into two classes—the\r\n_honestiores_ (more honorable) and the _humiliores_ (more humble or\r\nplebeians). The former class, which included the imperial senators, the\r\nsoldiers and the veterans, were exempt from execution except with the\r\nemperor’s consent, from penal servitude, and, with some limitations, from\r\ntorture in the course of judicial investigations.\r\n\r\n*The Senate.* The Senate at Rome was not abolished but continued to\r\nfunction both as a municipal council and as the mouthpiece of the\r\nsenatorial order. After the founding of Constantinople a similar Senate\r\nwas established there for the eastern part of the empire. At first all\r\n_clarissimi_ had a right to participate in the meetings of the Senate, and\r\ntheir sons were expected to fill the quaestorship. However, after the\r\nmiddle of the fifth century only those having the rank of _illustris_ were\r\nadmitted to the senate chamber, and the active Senate became a gathering\r\nof the highest officials and ex-officials of the state. In addition to\r\ntheir functions as municipal councils, the Senates made recommendations\r\nfor the quaestorship and praetorship, discussed with the imperial\r\nofficials the taxes which affected the senatorial order and even\r\nparticipated to a certain extent in drafting imperial legislation.\r\n\r\n*The senators and the municipalities.* The most important privilege\r\nenjoyed by the senators was their exemption from the control of the\r\nofficials of the municipalities within whose territories their estates\r\nwere situated. As we shall see, this was one of the chief reasons for the\r\nextension of their power in the provinces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       V. THE SYSTEM OF TAXATION AND THE RUIN OF THE MUNICIPALITIES\r\n\r\n\r\n*The system of taxation.* The debasement of the Roman coinage in the\r\ncourse of the third century resulted in a thorough disorganization of the\r\npublic finances, for the taxes and disbursements fixed in terms of money\r\nhad no longer their previous value. Diocletian completely reorganized the\r\nfinancial system by introducing a general scheme of taxation and\r\nremuneration in produce in place of coin, and by establishing a new method\r\nof assessment. This latter consisted in the division of the land, cattle\r\nand agricultural labor into units of equal tax value. The unit of taxation\r\nfor land was the _iugum_, which differed in size for arable land,\r\nvineyards and orchards, as well as for soils of varying fertility. A fixed\r\nnumber of cattle likewise constituted a _iugum_, assessed at the same\r\nvalue as a _iugum_ of land. The unit of labor, regarded as the equivalent\r\nof the _iugum_ was the _caput_, which was defined as one man or two women\r\nengaged in agricultural occupations. Thus the workers were taxed in\r\naddition to the land they tilled.\r\n\r\n*The indiction.* The amount of the land tax to be raised each year was\r\nannounced in an annual proclamation called an indiction (_indictio_), and\r\na revaluation of the tax units was made periodically. The term indiction\r\nwas also used of the period between two reassessments, which occurred at\r\nfirst every five, but after 312 A. D. every fifteen, years. The indictions\r\nthus furnished the basis for a new system of chronology. From the taxes\r\nraised in kind the soldiers and those in the civil service received their\r\npay in the form of an allowance (_annona_), which might under certain\r\nconditions be commuted for its monetary equivalent.\r\n\r\n*Special taxes.* In addition to the land tax raised in the form of produce\r\non the basis of the _iuga_ and _capita_, there were certain other taxes\r\npayable in money. The chief of these were: the _chrysargyrum_, a tax\r\nlevied on all trades; the _aurum coronarium_, a nominally voluntary but\r\nreally compulsory contribution paid by the municipal senators every five\r\nyears to enable the emperor to distribute largesses to his officials and\r\ntroops; the _aurum oblaticium_, a similar payment made by the senatorial\r\norder of the empire; and the _collatio glebalis_ or _follis senatoria_, a\r\nspecial tax imposed upon senators by Constantine I.\r\n\r\n*Munera.* Besides the taxes, the government laid upon its subjects the\r\nburden of performing certain public services without compensation. The\r\nmost burdensome of these charges (_munera_) were the upkeep of the public\r\npost, and the furnishing of quarters (_hospitium_) and rendering other\r\nservices in connection with the movement of troops, officials and\r\nsupplies. So heavy was the burden of the post that it denuded of draught\r\nanimals the districts it traversed and had to be abandoned in the sixth\r\ncentury. It was in connection with the exaction of these charges, the\r\ncollection of the revenue in kind, and in the administration of justice\r\nthat the imperial officials found opportunity to practice extortions which\r\nweighed more heavily upon the taxpayers than the taxes themselves.\r\n\r\n*The curiales.* The class which suffered most directly from the\r\nestablished fiscal system was that of the _curiales_, as the members of\r\nthe municipal senatorial orders were now called. In the course of the\r\nthird century the status of _curialis_ had become hereditary, and was an\r\nobligation upon all who possessed a definite property qualification, fixed\r\nat twenty-five _iugera_ of land in the fourth century. Since the local\r\nsenates had become agents of the _fiscus_ in collecting the revenues from\r\ntheir municipal territories, the _curiales_, through the municipal\r\nofficers or committees of the local council, had to apportion the quotas\r\nof the municipal burden among the landholders, to collect them, and be\r\nresponsible for the payment of the total amount to the public officers.\r\nThey were also responsible for the maintenance of the public post and the\r\nperformance of other services resting upon the municipalities. Inevitably\r\nthe _curiales_ sought to protect themselves by shifting the burden of\r\ntaxation as much as possible upon the lower classes in the municipal\r\nterritory who regarded them as oppressors. “Every _curialis_ is a tyrant”\r\n(_quot curiales, tot tyranni_), says a fourth century writer.\r\n\r\nThe exactions of the imperial officers proved more than the _curiales_\r\ncould meet, and they sought to withdraw from their order and its\r\nobligations. But the government required responsible landholders and so\r\nthey were forbidden to dispose of their properties or to leave their place\r\nof residence without special permission. And when they tried to find\r\nexemption by entering the imperial senatorial order, the military or civil\r\nservice, or the clergy, these avenues of escape were likewise closed. Only\r\nthose who had filled all the municipal offices might become _clarissimi_\r\nand immune from the curial obligations, and only clergy of the rank of\r\nbishops were excused, while the lower orders had to supply a substitute or\r\nsurrender two-thirds of their property before they could leave the\r\n_curia_. Valentinian I attempted to aid the _curiales_ by appointing\r\nofficials known as _defensores __civitatium_ or _plebis_—“defenders of the\r\ncities” or “of the plebs”—whose duty it was to check unjust exactions and\r\nprotect the common people against officials and judges. These _defensores_\r\nwere at first persons of influence, chosen by the municipalities and\r\napproved by the emperor. They were empowered to try certain cases\r\nthemselves, and had the right to address themselves directly to the\r\nemperor without reference to the provincial governor. However, the\r\n_defensores_ accomplished little, and in the fifth century their office\r\nhad become an additional obligatory service resting upon the _curiales_.\r\nBy 429 A. D. hardly a _curialis_ with adequate property qualifications\r\ncould be found in any city, and by the sixth century the class of\r\nmunicipal landholders had practically disappeared.\r\n\r\n*The hereditary corporations.* We have seen how, in the course of the\r\nthird century, the professional corporations were burdened with the duty\r\nof performing certain public services in the interest of the communities\r\nto which they belonged. The first step taken by the state to insure the\r\nperformance of these services was to make this duty a charge which rested\r\npermanently upon the property of the members of the corporations\r\n(_corporati_), no matter into whose possession it passed. But men as well\r\nas money were needed for the performance of these charges, and\r\nconsequently, in order to prevent a decline in the numbers of the\r\n_corporati_, the state made membership in these associations an hereditary\r\nobligation. This was really an extension of the principle that a man was\r\nbound to perform certain services in the community in which he was\r\nenrolled (his _origo_). Finally, the emperors exercised the right of\r\nconscription, and attached to the various corporations which were in need\r\nof recruits persons who were engaged in less needed occupations.\r\n\r\nThe burden of their charges led the _corporati_, like the _curiales_, to\r\nseek refuge in some other profession. They tried to secure enrollment in\r\nthe army, among the _officiales_, or to become _coloni_ of the emperor or\r\nsenatorial landholders. But all these havens of refuge were closed by\r\nimperial edicts, and when discovered the truant _corporatus_ was dragged\r\nback to his association. Only those who attained the highest office within\r\ntheir corporation were legally freed from their obligations.\r\n\r\nAlthough the corporations probably retained their former organization and\r\nofficers, their active heads were now called _patroni_, and these directed\r\nthe public services of their colleges. In Rome and Constantinople the\r\ncolleges were under the supervision of the city prefects, in the\r\nmunicipalities under that of the local magistrates and provincial\r\ngovernors. The professional colleges are the only ones which survived\r\nduring the late empire. The religious and funerary associations vanished\r\nwith the spread of Christianity and the general impoverishment of the\r\nlower classes.\r\n\r\n*The coloni.* Among the agricultural classes the forces which had\r\ndeveloped in the course of the principate were still at work. In the\r\nfourth century the attachment of the tenant farmers and peasant laborers\r\nto the soil was extended to the whole empire. The status of the _coloni_\r\nbecame hereditary, like that of the _corporati_. Their condition was half\r\nway between that of freedmen and that of slaves, for while they were bound\r\nto the estate upon which they resided and passed with it from one owner to\r\nanother, they were not absolutely under the power of the owner and could\r\nnot be disposed of by him apart from the land. They had also other rights\r\nwhich slaves lacked, yet as time went on their condition tended to\r\napproximate more and more closely to servitude. “Slaves of the soil,” they\r\nwere called in the sixth century. As this status of serfdom was hitherto\r\nunknown in Roman law, a great many imperial enactments had to be issued\r\ndefining the rights and duties of the _coloni_.\r\n\r\n*The growth of private domains.* The development of vast private estates\r\nat the expense of the public and imperial domains was another prominent\r\ncharacteristic of the times. This was the result of the failure of the\r\nstate to check the spread of waste lands, in spite of its attempt to\r\ndevelop the system of hereditary leaseholds to small farmers. To maintain\r\nthe level of production the government opened the way for the great\r\nproprietors to take over all deserted lands under various forms of\r\nheritable lease or in freehold tenure. The system of attaching waste lands\r\nto those of the neighboring landholders and making the latter responsible\r\nfor their cultivation was an added cause of the growth of large estates.\r\nThe result of this development was that the state tenants became _coloni_\r\nof the great landlords, and the latter were responsible for the taxes and\r\nother obligations of their _coloni_ to the state. The weight of these\r\nobligations rested as before upon the _coloni_, and led to their continued\r\nflight and a further increase in waste land. Like the _curiales_ and\r\n_corporati_, the _coloni_ tried to exchange their status by entering the\r\npublic service or attaining admission to some other social class. But, in\r\nlike manner also, they found themselves excluded from all other\r\noccupations and classes. Only the fugitive _colonus_ who had managed to\r\nremain undetected for thirty years (in the case of women twenty years)\r\ncould escape being handed back to the land which he had deserted.\r\n\r\n*The power of the landed nobility.* The immunities of the senatorial order\r\nand the power of the high officials tended to give an almost feudal\r\ncharacter to the position of the great landed proprietors. These had\r\ninherited the judicial powers of the procurators on the imperial estates\r\nand transferred this authority to their own domains. Over their slaves and\r\n_coloni_ they exercised the powers of police and jurisdiction. As they\r\nwere not subject to the municipal authorities, and, during the greater\r\npart of the fourth century, were also exempt from the jurisdiction of the\r\nprovincial governors they assumed a very independent position, and did not\r\nhesitate to defy the municipal magistrates and even the minor agents of\r\nthe imperial government. Their power made their protection extremely\r\nvaluable, and led to a new type of patronage. Individuals and village\r\ncommunities, desirous of escaping from the exactions to which they were\r\nsubject in their municipal districts, placed themselves under the\r\npatronage of some senatorial landholder and became his tenants. And he did\r\nnot hesitate to afford them an illegal protection against the local\r\nauthorities. Complaints by the latter to higher officials secured little\r\nredress for they were themselves proprietors and sided with those of their\r\nown class. The power of the state was thus nullified by its chief servants\r\nand the landed aristocracy became the heirs of the empire.\r\n\r\n*Resumé.* The transformation which society underwent during the empire may\r\nbe aptly described as the transition from a régime of individual\r\ninitiative to a régime of status, that is, from one in which the position\r\nof an individual in society was mainly determined by his own volition to\r\none in which this was fixed by the accident of his birth. The population\r\nof the empire was divided into a number of sharply defined castes, each of\r\nwhich was compelled to play a definite rôle in the life of the state. The\r\nsons of senators, soldiers, _curiales_, _corporati_, and _coloni_ had to\r\nfollow in their fathers’ walks of life, and each sought to escape from the\r\ntasks to which he was born. In the eyes of the government _collegiati_,\r\n_curiales_, and _coloni_ existed solely to pay taxes for the support of\r\nthe bureaucracy and the army. The consequence was the attempted flight of\r\nthe population to the army, civil service, the church or the wilderness.\r\nPrivate industry languished, commerce declined, the fields lay untilled; a\r\ngeneral feeling of hopelessness paralyzed all initiative. And when the\r\nbarbarians began to occupy the provinces they encountered no national\r\nresistance; rather were they looked upon as deliverers from the burdensome\r\nyoke of Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GERMANIC OCCUPATION OF ITALY AND THE WESTERN PROVINCES: 395–493 A. D.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 I. GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PERIOD\r\n\r\n\r\n*The partition of the empire.* With the death of Theodosius the Great the\r\nempire passed to his sons, Arcadius a youth of eighteen, whom he had left\r\nin Constantinople, and Honorius a boy of eleven, whom he had designated as\r\nthe Augustus for the West. However, in the East the government was really\r\nin the hands of Rufinus, the pretorian prefect of Illyricum, while an even\r\ngreater influence was exercised in the West by Stilicho, the Vandal master\r\nof the soldiers, whom Theodosius had selected as regent for the young\r\nHonorius. The rivalry of these two ambitious men, and the attempt of\r\nStilicho to secure for Honorius the restoration of eastern Illyricum,\r\nwhich had been attached by Gratian to the sphere of the eastern emperor,\r\nwere the immediate causes of the complete and formal division of the\r\nempire into an eastern and a western half, a condition which had been\r\nforeshadowed by the division of the imperial power throughout the greater\r\npart of the fourth century.\r\n\r\nThe fiction of imperial unity was still preserved by the nomination of one\r\nconsul in Rome and one in Constantinople, by the association of the\r\nstatues of both Augusti in each part of the empire, and by the issuance of\r\nimperial enactments under their joint names. Nevertheless, there was a\r\ncomplete separation of administrative authority, the edicts issued by one\r\nemperor required the sanction of the other before attaining validity\r\nwithin his territory, and upon the death of one Augustus the actual\r\ngovernment of the whole empire did not pass into the hands of the\r\nsurvivor. The empire had really split into two independent states.\r\n\r\n*The Germanic invasions.* In addition to the partition of the empire, the\r\nperiod between 395 and 493 is marked by the complete breakdown of the\r\nRoman resistance to barbarian invasions, and the penetration and\r\noccupation of the western provinces and Italy itself by peoples of\r\nGermanic stock. The position of Roman and barbarian is reversed; the\r\nlatter become the rulers, the former their subjects, and the power passes\r\nfrom the Roman officials to the Germanic kings. Finally, a barbarian\r\nsoldier seats himself upon the throne of the western emperor, and a\r\nGermanic kingdom is established in Italy.\r\n\r\n*The military dictators.* During this period of disintegration, the real\r\npower in the western empire was in the hands of a series of military\r\ndictators, who with the office of master of the soldiers secured the\r\nposition of commander-in-chief of the imperial armies. Beside them the\r\nemperors exercised only nominal authority. But as these dictators were\r\neither barbarians themselves, or depended upon barbarian troops for their\r\nsupport, they were continually intrigued against and opposed by the Roman\r\nor civilian element, headed by the civil officers of the court. Yet the\r\nfall of one “kingmaker” was always followed by the rise of another, for by\r\ntheir aid alone could the Romans offer any effective resistance to the\r\nflood of barbarian invasion.\r\n\r\n*The empire maintained in the East.* But while the western empire was thus\r\nabsorbed by the Germanic invaders, the empire in the East was able to\r\noffer a successful resistance both to foreign invasions and the ambitions\r\nof its own barbarian generals. This is in part accounted for by the\r\ngreater solidarity and vigor of the Hellenic civilization of the eastern\r\nprovinces, and the military strength of the population, particularly in\r\nAsia Minor, and in part by the success of the bureaucracy in holding the\r\ngenerals in check, a task which was facilitated by the division of the\r\nsupreme military authority among several masters of the soldiers. The\r\nstrength of the eastern empire caused the West to look to it for support\r\nand the western emperors upon several occasions were nominated, and at\r\nother times given the sanction of legitimacy, by those in the East.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      II. THE VISIGOTHIC MIGRATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n*The revolt of Alaric, 395 A. D.* Seizing the opportunity created by the\r\ndeath of Theodosius and the absence of the army of the East which he had\r\nled into Italy, Alaric, a prince of the Visigothic _foederati_, began to\r\nravage Thrace and Macedonia with a band of his own people, aided by other\r\ntribes from across the Danube. He was opposed by Stilicho who was leading\r\nback the troops of the eastern emperor and intended to occupy eastern\r\nIllyricum. However, the latter was ordered by Arcadius to send the army of\r\nthe East to Constantinople and complied. This gave Alaric free access to\r\nsouthern Greece which he systematically plundered. However, Stilicho again\r\nintervened. He transported an army by sea to the Peloponnesus, and\r\nmaneuvered Alaric into a precarious situation, but came to terms with him,\r\npossibly because of a revolt which had broken out in Africa. Stilicho was\r\ndeclared an enemy by Arcadius, while Alaric, after devastating Epirus,\r\nsettled there with his Goths, and extorted the title of _magister militum_\r\nfrom the eastern court.\r\n\r\n*The death of Stilicho, 408 A. D.* In 401 A. D., when Stilicho was\r\noccupied with an inroad of Vandals and Alans into Raetia, Alaric invaded\r\nItaly. However, Stilicho forced him to withdraw, and foiled a second\r\nattempt at invasion in 403 A. D. But Alaric did not long remain inactive.\r\nHe now held the title of master of the soldiers from Honorius and had\r\nagreed to help Stilicho to accomplish his designs upon Illyricum. But when\r\nthe western empire was embarrassed by new invasions and the appearance of\r\na usurper in Gaul, he made his way into Noricum and demanded an indemnity\r\nand employment for his troops. By the advice of Stilicho his demands,\r\nwhich included a payment of 4000 pounds of gold, were complied with.\r\nShortly afterwards, Stilicho fell a victim to a plot hatched by the court\r\nofficials who were jealous of his influence (408 A. D.).\r\n\r\n*The Visigoths in Italy.* The death of Stilicho removed the only capable\r\ndefender of Italy and, when Honorius refused to carry out the agreement\r\nwith Alaric, the latter crossed the Alps. Honorius shut himself up in\r\nRavenna, and the Goths marched on Rome, which ransomed itself at a heavy\r\nprice. As Honorius still refused to make him master of the soldiers and to\r\ngive him lands and supplies for his men, Alaric returned to Rome and set\r\nup a new emperor, named Attalus. Yet Honorius, supported by troops from\r\nthe eastern empire, remained obdurate, and a disagreement between Alaric\r\nand Attalus led to the latter’s deposition. Rome was then occupied by the\r\nGoths who plundered it for three days (410 A. D.). Alaric’s next move was\r\nto march to south Italy with the intention of crossing to Sicily and\r\nAfrica. But his flotilla was destroyed by a storm, and while retracing his\r\nsteps northwards he suddenly took sick and died.\r\n\r\n*The Goths in Gaul and Spain.* Alaric’s successor was his brother-in-law,\r\nAtaulf, who led the Visigoths into Gaul (412 A. D.), where he at first\r\nallied himself with a usurper, Jovinus, but soon deserted him to take\r\nservice with the Romans. However, when Honorius failed to furnish him\r\nsupplies, he seized Narbonne and other towns in southern Gaul and married\r\nthe emperor’s sister, Placidia, whom the Goths had carried off captive\r\nfrom Rome. He again attempted to come to terms with the Romans, but\r\nfailed, and Constantius, the Roman master of the soldiers, who had\r\nsucceeded to the position and influence of Stilicho, forced him to abandon\r\nGaul. Ataulf and the Goths crossed the Pyrenees into Spain, where he died\r\nin 415 A. D. His successor Wallia, being hard pressed by famine and\r\nfailing in an attempt to invade Africa, came to terms with the Romans. He\r\nsurrendered Placidia and in the name of the emperor attacked the Vandals\r\nand Alans who had occupied parts of Spain. Alarmed by his success\r\nConstantius recalled the Goths to Gaul, where they were settled in\r\nsouthern Aquitania (418 A. D.).\r\n\r\n*The Visigothic kingdom in Gaul.* The status of the Goths in Gaul was that\r\nof _foederati_, bound to render military aid to Rome, but governed by\r\ntheir own kings. The latter, however, had no authority over the Roman\r\npopulation among whom the Goths were settled. This condition was\r\nunsatisfactory to the Gothic rulers who sought to establish an independent\r\nGothic kingdom. Theodoric I, the successor of Wallia, forced the Romans to\r\nacknowledge his complete sovereignty over Aquitania, but failed in his\r\nattempt to conquer Narbonese Gaul. However, he joined forces with the\r\nRomans against Attila the Hun and was largely responsible for checking the\r\nlatter at the battle of the Mauriac plain (451 A. D.) in which he lost his\r\nlife. For a time the Goths remained on friendly terms with the imperial\r\nauthority but under Euric, who became king in 466 A. D., the anti-Roman\r\nfaction was in the ascendant and they embarked upon a policy of expansion.\r\nIn 475 Euric, after a protracted struggle, gained possession of the\r\ndistrict of Auvergne, and the Roman emperor acknowledged his sovereignty\r\nover the country between the Atlantic and the Rhone, the Loire and the\r\nPyrenees, besides some territory in Spain. Two years later the district\r\nbetween the Rhone and the Alps, south of the Durance, was added to the\r\nVisigothic kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             III. THE VANDALS\r\n\r\n\r\n*The invasions of 406 A. D.* In 405 A. D. an invading horde of Vandals and\r\nAlans, who had descended upon Italy, was utterly defeated by Stilicho. But\r\nin the following year fresh swarms of the same peoples, united with the\r\nSuevi, crossed the Rhine near Mainz and plundered Gaul as far as the\r\nPyrenees. For a short time they were held in check by the usurper\r\nConstantine, who held sway in Gaul and Spain. However, when he was\r\ninvolved in a struggle with a rival, Gerontius, they found an opportunity\r\nto make their way into Spain (409 A. D.).\r\n\r\n*The occupation of Spain.* The united peoples speedily made themselves\r\nmasters of the whole Iberian peninsula. But in spite of their successes\r\nover the Roman troops, the lack of supplies forced them to come to terms\r\nwith the empire. In 411 they became Roman _foederati_ and were granted\r\nlands for settlement. Under this agreement the Asdingian Vandals and the\r\nSuevi occupied the northwest of Spain, the Alans the center, and the\r\nSilingian Vandals the south. However, the Roman government had only made\r\npeace with the Vandals and their allies under pressure, and seized the\r\nfirst opportunity to rid themselves of these unwelcome guests. In 416\r\nConstantius authorized the Visigoths under Wallia to attack them in the\r\nname of the emperor. Wallia was so successful that he utterly annihilated\r\nthe Silingian Vandals, and so weakened the Alans that they united\r\nthemselves with the Asdingian Vandals, who escaped destruction only\r\nthrough the recall of the Visigoths to Gaul. However, the Vandals quickly\r\nrecovered from their defeats, waged successful war upon the Suevi, who had\r\nreached an agreement with the Romans, and occupied the whole of southern\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\n*The Vandal kingdom in Africa.* In 429 A. D. the Vandals under the\r\nleadership of their king Gaiseric crossed into Africa, attracted by the\r\nrichness of its soil and its strategic importance as one of the granaries\r\nof the Roman world. Their invasion was facilitated by the existence of a\r\nstate of war between Count Bonifacius, the military governor of Africa,\r\nand the western emperor. The number of the invaders was estimated at\r\n80,000, of whom probably 15,000 or 20,000 were fighting men.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the reconciliation between Bonifacius and the imperial\r\ngovernment and their united opposition, Gaiseric was able to overrun the\r\nopen country although he failed to capture the chief cities. In 435 A. D.\r\npeace was concluded and the Vandals were allowed to settle in Numidia,\r\nonce more as _foederati_ of the empire. However, in 439 A. D. Gaiseric\r\nbroke the peace and treacherously seized Carthage. This step was followed\r\nby the organization of a fleet which harried the coasts of Sicily. In 442\r\nthe western emperor acknowledged the independence of the Vandal kingdom.\r\nPeace continued until 455, when the assassination of the emperor\r\nValentinian III gave Gaiseric the pretext for a descent upon Italy and the\r\nseizure of Rome which was systematically plundered of its remaining\r\ntreasures, although its buildings and monuments were not wantonly\r\ndestroyed. Among the captives was Eudoxia, widow of the late emperor, and\r\nher daughters, who were valuable hostages in the hands of Gaiseric.\r\n\r\nThe lack of coöperation between the eastern and western empires against\r\nthe Vandals enabled them to extend their power still further. Their fleets\r\ncontrolled the whole of the Mediterranean and ravaged both its western and\r\nits eastern coasts. A powerful expedition fitted out by the eastern\r\nemperor Leo I in 468 for the invasion of Africa ended in utter failure,\r\nand in 476 his successor Zeno was compelled to come to terms and\r\nacknowledge the authority of the Vandals over the territory under their\r\ncontrol. At the death of Gaiseric in 477 A. D. the Vandal kingdom included\r\nall Roman Africa, the Balearic Islands, Corsica, Sardinia, and the\r\nfortress of Lilybaeum in Sicily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 IV. THE BURGUNDIANS, FRANKS, AND SAXONS\r\n\r\n\r\n*The Burgundian invasion of Gaul.* The invasion of Gaul by the Vandals and\r\nAlans in 406 A. D. was followed by an inroad of the Burgundians, Ripuarian\r\nFranks and Alemanni. The two latter peoples established themselves on the\r\nleft bank of the Rhine, while the Burgundians penetrated further south. In\r\n433 the Burgundians were at war with the empire and were defeated by\r\nAetius, the Roman master of the soldiers in Gaul. Subsequently they were\r\nsettled in the Savoy. Thence, about 457, they began to expand until they\r\noccupied the whole valley of the Rhone as far south as the Durance.\r\n\r\nYet on the whole they remained loyal _foederati_ of the empire. They\r\nfought under Aetius against Attila in 451, and their kings bore the Roman\r\ntitle of _magister militum_ until the reign of Gundobad (473–516), who was\r\ngiven the rank of patrician by the emperor Olybrius.\r\n\r\n*The Salian Franks.* The Salian Franks, as those who had once dwelt on the\r\nshores of the North Sea were called in contrast to the Ripuarians, whose\r\nhome was on the banks of the Rhine, crossed the lower Rhine before the\r\nmiddle of the fourth century and occupied Toxandria, the region between\r\nthe Meuse and the Scheldt. They were defeated by Julian who, however, left\r\nthem in possession of this district as Roman _foederati_. The disturbances\r\nof the early fifth century enabled the Salian Franks to assert their\r\nindependence of Roman suzerainty, and to extend their territory as far\r\nsouth as the Somme. Still, they fought as Roman allies against the Huns in\r\n451 A. D., and their king Childeric, who began to rule shortly afterwards,\r\nremained a faithful _foederatus_ of Rome until his death in 481 A. D.\r\n\r\nIn 486 A. D. Clovis, the successor of Childeric, overthrew the Gallo-Roman\r\nstate to the south of the Somme and extended his kingdom to meet the\r\nVisigoths on the Loire. Thus the whole of Gaul passed under the rule of\r\nGermanic peoples.\r\n\r\n*The Saxons in Britain.* After the decisive defeat of the Picts and Scots\r\nby Theodosius, the father of Theodosius the Great, in 368 and 369 A. D.,\r\nthe Romans were able to maintain the defence of Britain until the close of\r\nthe fourth century. But in 402 Stilicho was obliged to recall part of the\r\ngarrison of the island for the protection of Italy, and in 406\r\nConstantine, who had laid claim to the imperial crown in Britain, took\r\nwith him the remaining Roman troops in his attempt to obtain recognition\r\non the continent. The ensuing struggles with the barbarians in Gaul\r\nprevented the Romans from sending officials or troops across the channel,\r\nand the Britons had to depend upon their own resources for their defense.\r\n\r\nThe task proved beyond their strength and it is probable that by the\r\nmiddle of the fifth century the Germanic tribes of Saxons, Angles and\r\nJutes were firmly established in the eastern part of Britain. Because of\r\nthe uncivilized character of these peoples, of the fact that Roman culture\r\nwas not very deeply rooted among the native population, and of the\r\ndesperate resistance offered by the latter to the invaders, the subsequent\r\nstruggle for the possession of the island resulted in the obliteration of\r\nthe Latin language and the disappearance of that material civilization\r\nwhich had developed under four centuries of Roman rule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    V. THE FALL OF THE WESTERN EMPIRE\r\n\r\n\r\n*Honorius, 395–432 A. D.* After the murder of Stilicho in 408 A. D.,\r\nHonorius was faced with the problem of restoring his authority in Gaul,\r\nwhere for a time he had been forced to acknowledge the rule of a rival\r\nemperor Constantine who had donned the purple in Britain in 406 A. D.\r\nConstantius, a Roman noble who had succeeded Stilicho as master of the\r\nsoldiers, was despatched to Gaul in 411 and soon overthrew the usurper.\r\nTwo years later another rival, Jovinus, was crushed with the help of the\r\nVisigoths.\r\n\r\nConstantius, the leader of the anti-barbarian faction of the court, was\r\nnow the mainstay of the power of Honorius and used his influence to\r\nfurther his own ambitions. After the surrender of the princess Placidia by\r\nthe Visigoths he induced the emperor to grant him her hand in marriage\r\n(417 A. D.). In 421 A. D. Honorius appointed him co-emperor, but he was\r\nnot recognized as an Augustus at Constantinople and died in the same year.\r\nHis death was followed by a quarrel between the emperor and his sister, as\r\na result of which Placidia and her son took refuge under the protection of\r\nthe eastern emperor, Theodosius II.\r\n\r\n*Valentinian III, 425–455 A. D.* Honorius died in 423 A. D., leaving no\r\nchildren, and Castinus, the new master of the soldiers, secured the\r\nnomination of John, a high officer of the court, as his successor.\r\nHowever, Theodosius refused him recognition and his authority was defied\r\nby Bonifacius, an influential officer who had established himself in\r\nAfrica. Valentinian, the five-year-old son of Placidia and Constantius,\r\nwas escorted to Italy by forces of the eastern empire and John was\r\ndeposed. His chief supporter Aetius, who had brought an army of Huns to\r\nhis aid, was induced to dismiss his troops and accept a command in Gaul\r\nwith the rank of count. Placidia, who had returned to Italy with\r\nValentinian, became regent with the title of Augusta.\r\n\r\n*Aetius.* During the reign of Valentinian III interest centers about the\r\ncareer of Aetius, “last of the Romans.” In 429, after getting rid of his\r\nenemy Felix, who had succeeded to the position of Castinus, Aetius himself\r\nbecame master of the soldiers and the real ruler of the empire. However,\r\nthe Augusta Placidia endeavored to compass his downfall by an appeal to\r\nBonifacius, who after his revolt of 427 A. D. had fought in the imperial\r\ncause against the Vandals. In 432 Bonifacius returned to Italy and was\r\nappointed master of the soldiers in place of Aetius. The latter appealed\r\nto arms, was defeated near Ariminum, and forced to flee for refuge to his\r\nfriends the Huns. But as Bonifacius died not long after his victory,\r\nAetius, with the backing of the Huns, was able to force the emperor to\r\nreappoint him master of the soldiers in 433 A. D. From that time until his\r\ndeath in 454 he directed the imperial policy in the West. He received\r\nembassies from foreign peoples and the latter made treaties with him and\r\nnot with the emperor.\r\n\r\n*Attila’s invasion of Gaul, 451 A. D.* The chief efforts of Aetius were\r\ndirected towards the preservation of central and southeastern Gaul for the\r\nempire. In this he was successful, holding in check the Franks on the\r\nnorth, the Burgundians on the east, and the Goths in the southwest. But\r\nthough Gaul was saved, Africa was lost to the Vandals, Britain to the\r\nSaxons and the greater part of Spain to the Suevi. The success of Aetius\r\nin Gaul was principally due to his ability to draw into his service large\r\nnumbers of Hunnish troops, owing to the influence he had acquired with the\r\nleaders of that people while a hostage among them. At this time the Huns\r\noccupied the region of modern Hungary, Rumania, and South Russia. They\r\ncomprised a number of separate tribes, which in 444 A. D. were united\r\nunder the strong hand of King Attila, who also extended his sway over\r\nneighboring Germanic and Scythian peoples.\r\n\r\nAt first Attila remained on friendly terms with Aetius but his ambitions\r\nand his interference in the affairs of Gaul led to friction and to his\r\ndemand for the hand of Honoria, sister of Valentinian III, with half of\r\nthe western empire as her dowry. When the emperor refused to comply Attila\r\nled a great army across the Rhine into Gaul and laid siege to Orleans.\r\nTheir common danger brought together the Romans and the Germanic peoples\r\nof Gaul, and Aetius was able to face the Huns with an army strengthened by\r\nthe presence of the kings of the Visigoths and the Franks. Repulsed at\r\nOrleans, Attila withdrew to the Mauric plains where, in the vicinity of\r\nTroyes, a memorable battle was fought between the Huns and the forces of\r\nAetius. Although the result was indecisive, Attila would not risk another\r\nengagement and recrossed the Rhine. The next year he invaded Italy, but\r\nthe presence of famine and disease among his own forces and the arrival of\r\ntroops from the Eastern Empire induced him to listen to the appeal of a\r\nRoman embassy, led by the Roman bishop Leo, and to withdraw from the\r\npeninsula without occupying Rome. Upon his death in 453 A. D. his empire\r\nfell to pieces and the power of the Huns began to decline.\r\n\r\n*Maximus and Avitus, 455–6 A. D.* The death of Attila was soon followed by\r\nthat of Aetius, who was murdered by Valentinian at the instigation of his\r\nchamberlain Heraclius (454 A. D.). This rash act deprived him of the best\r\nsupport of his authority and in the next year Valentinian himself fell a\r\nvictim to the vengeance of followers of Aetius. With him ended the dynasty\r\nof Theodosius in the West. The new emperor, a senator named Petronius\r\nMaximus, compelled Valentinian’s widow, Eudoxia, to marry him, but when\r\nthe Vandal Gaiseric appeared in Italy in answer to her call he offered no\r\nresistance and perished in flight. Maximus was succeeded by Avitus, a\r\nGallic follower of Aetius, whom he had made master of the soldiers. But\r\nafter ruling little more than a year Avitus was deposed by his own master\r\nof the soldiers, Ricimer (456 A. D.).\r\n\r\n*Ricimer.* Ricimer, a German of Suevic and Gothic ancestry, who succeeded\r\nto the power of Aetius, was the virtual ruler of the western empire from\r\n456 until his death in 472. Backed by his mercenary troops he made and\r\nunmade emperors at his pleasure, and never permitted his nominees to be\r\nmore than his puppets. Majorian, who was appointed emperor in 457 A. D.,\r\nwas overthrown by Ricimer in 461, and was followed by Severus. After the\r\ndeath of Severus in 465 no emperor was appointed in the West for two\r\nyears. The imperial power was nominally concentrated in the hands of the\r\neastern emperor, Leo, while Ricimer was in actual control of the\r\ngovernment in Italy. In 467, Leo sent as emperor to Rome, Anthemius, a\r\nprominent dignitary of the eastern court, whose daughter was married to\r\nRicimer in order to secure the coöperation of the latter in a joint attack\r\nof the two empires upon the Vandal kingdom in Africa. However, in 472\r\nRicimer broke with Anthemius who had endeavored with the support of the\r\nRoman Senate to free himself from the influence of the powerful barbarian.\r\nAnthemius was besieged in Rome, and put to death following the capture of\r\nthe city. Thereupon Ricimer raised to the purple Olybrius, a son-in-law of\r\nValentinian III. But both the new emperor and his patron died in the\r\ncourse of the same year (472 A. D.).\r\n\r\n*The last years of the western empire.* In 473 A. D. Gundobad, the nephew\r\nof Ricimer, caused Glycerius to be proclaimed emperor. However, his\r\nappointment was not recognized by Leo, who nominated Julius Nepos. The\r\nnext year Nepos invaded Italy and overthrew his rival, only to meet a like\r\nfate at the hands of Orestes, whom he had made master of the soldiers (475\r\nA. D.). Orestes did not assume the imperial title himself, but bestowed it\r\nupon his son Romulus, known as Augustulus. But Orestes was unable to\r\nmaintain his position for long. The Germanic mercenaries in Italy—Herculi,\r\nSciri, and others—led by Odovacar, demanded for themselves lands in Italy\r\nsuch as their kinsmen had been granted as _foederati_ in the provinces.\r\nWhen their demands were refused they mutinied and slew Orestes. Romulus\r\nwas forced to abdicate, and Odovacar assumed the title of king (476\r\nA. D.). The soldiers were settled on Italian soil and the barbarians\r\nacquired full control of the western empire.\r\n\r\n*The kingship of Odovacar, 476–493 A. D.* With the deposition of Romulus\r\nAugustulus, the commander-in-chief of the barbarian soldiery, long the\r\nvirtual ruler in the western empire, was recognized as legally exercising\r\nthis power. The imperial authority was united in the person of the eastern\r\nemperor who sanctioned the rule of Odovacar by granting him the title of\r\npatrician, which had been held already by Aetius, Ricimer and Orestes. The\r\nbarbarian king was at the same time the imperial regent in Italy.\r\n\r\nBut it was only in Italy that Odovacar obtained recognition. The last\r\nremnants of Roman authority vanished in Gaul and Spain, while Raetia and\r\nNoricum were abandoned to the Alamanni, Thuringi and Rugii.\r\n\r\n*The Ostrogothic conquest of Italy, 488–493 A. D.* In 488 A. D. the\r\nposition of Odovacar in Italy was challenged by Theodoric, king of the\r\nOstrogoths. This people after having long been subject to the Huns,\r\nrecovered their freedom at the death of Attila, and settled in Pannonia as\r\n_foederati_ of the eastern empire. Theodoric, who became sole ruler of the\r\nOstrogoths in 481 A. D., had proved himself a troublesome ally of the\r\nemperor Zeno who mistrusted his ambitions. Accordingly when Theodoric\r\ndemanded an imperial commission to attack Odovacar in Italy, Zeno readily\r\ngranted him the desired authority in order to remove him to a greater\r\ndistance from Constantinople. In 488 Theodoric set out with his followers\r\nto invade Italy. Odovacar was defeated in two battles and, in 490 A. D.,\r\nblockaded in Ravenna. After a long siege he agreed to surrender upon\r\ncondition that he and Theodoric should rule jointly over Italy. Shortly\r\nafterwards he and most of his followers were treacherously assassinated by\r\nthe Ostrogoths (493 A. D.). Theodoric now ruled Italy as king of the\r\nOstrogoths and an official of the Roman empire, probably retaining the\r\ntitle of master of the soldiers which he had held in the East.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                VI. THE SURVIVAL OF THE EMPIRE IN THE EAST\r\n\r\n\r\n*Arcadius, 395–408 A. D.* The year of the death of Theodosius the Great\r\nsaw the Asiatic provinces of the empire overrun by the Huns who ravaged\r\nSyria and Asia Minor, while the Visigoths under Alaric devastated the\r\nBalkan peninsula. The absence of the eastern troops in Italy prevented the\r\ngovernment from offering any effective opposition to either foe. And when\r\nStilicho came to the rescue from Italy and was holding the Visigoths in\r\ncheck, his rival the praetorian prefect Rufinus, who directed the policy\r\nof the young Arcadius, induced the emperor to order Stilicho to withdraw\r\nand sent the troops of the East to Constantinople. This order resulted in\r\nthe death of Rufinus, who was killed by the returning soldiery at the\r\norders of their commander, the Goth Gaïnas.\r\n\r\nThe influential position of Rufinus at the court fell to the\r\ngrand-chamberlain Eutropius, who had been an enemy of the late prefect. He\r\nhad induced Arcadius to marry Eudoxia, daughter of a Frankish chief,\r\ninstead of the daughter of Rufinus, as the latter had desired. The fall of\r\nEutropius was brought about by Gaïnas, now a master of the soldiers, who\r\nsought to play the rôle of Stilicho in the East. He was supported by the\r\nempress Eudoxia, who chafed under the domination of the chamberlain. In\r\n399 on the occasion of a revolt of the Gothic troops in Phrygia, Gaïnas\r\nheld aloof and the failure of the nominee of Eutropius to crush the\r\nmovement gave him the opportunity to bring about the latter’s dismissal\r\nand eventually his death.\r\n\r\nBut Gaïnas did not long retain his power. He quarrelled with the empress,\r\nand the Arianism of himself and his followers roused the animosity of the\r\npopulation of the capital. A massacre of the Goths in Constantinople\r\nfollowed and with the aid of a loyal Goth Fravitta, Gaïnas was driven\r\nnorth of the Danube where he was slain by the Huns (400 A. D.). The\r\ninfluence of Eudoxia was now paramount. However, she found a critic in the\r\neloquent bishop of Constantinople, John Chrysostom, who inveighed against\r\nthe extravagance and dissipation of the society of the court, and directed\r\nhis censures towards the empress in particular. Ultimately, Eudoxia was\r\nable to have him deposed from his see in 404 A. D., a few months before\r\nhis death. Four years later Arcadius himself died, leaving the empire to\r\nhis eight-year-old son Theodosius II.\r\n\r\n*Theodosius II, 408–450 A. D.* At the opening of the reign of Theodosius\r\nII the government was in the hands of the praetorian prefect Anthemius,\r\nwho had shown himself an able administrator during the last years of\r\nArcadius. However, in 414, the emperor’s elder sister, Pulcheria, was made\r\nregent with the title of Augusta. She was a strong personality and for\r\nmany years completely dominated the emperor who was lacking in\r\nindependence of character and energy. In 421 Pulcheria selected as a wife\r\nfor Theodosius, Athenais, the daughter of an Athenian sophist, who took\r\nthe name of Eudocia upon accepting Christianity. After a lapse of some\r\nyears differences arose between the empress and her sister-in-law which\r\nled to the latter’s withdrawal from the court (after 431 A. D.). But,\r\nabout 440, Eudocia lost her influence over the emperor; she was compelled\r\nto retire from Constantinople and reside in Jerusalem, where she lived\r\nuntil her death in 460. The reins of power then passed to the grand\r\nchamberlain Chrysapius, whose corrupt administration rivalled that of his\r\npredecessor Eutropius.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Theodosius II the peace of the eastern empire was\r\nbroken by a war with Persia and by inroads of the Huns. The Persian war\r\nwhich began in 421 as a result of persecutions of the Christians in Persia\r\nwas brought to a victorious conclusion in the next year. A second war, the\r\nresult of a Persian invasion in 441, ended with a Persian defeat in 442.\r\nBut with the Huns the Romans were not so fortunate. In 434, king Rua, the\r\nruler of the Huns in the plains of Hungary, had extorted from the empire\r\nthe payment of an annual tribute to secure immunity from invasion. At the\r\naccession of Attila and his brother in 433, this tribute was raised to 700\r\npounds of gold and the Romans were forbidden to give shelter to fugitives\r\nfrom the power of the Huns. But the payment of tribute failed to win a\r\npermanent respite, for Attila was bent on draining the wealth of the\r\nempire and reducing it to a condition of helplessness. In 441–43 the Huns\r\nswarmed over the Balkan provinces and defeated the imperial armies. An\r\nindemnity of 6000 pounds of gold was exacted and the annual payment\r\nincreased to 2100 pounds. Another disastrous raid occurred in 447. The\r\nempire could offer no resistance, and so Chrysapius plotted the\r\nassassination of Attila, but the plot was detected. Attila claimed to\r\nregard himself as the overlord of Theodosius.\r\n\r\nIn 438 there was published the Theodosian code, a collection of imperial\r\nedicts which constituted the administrative law of the empire, and which\r\nwas accepted in the West as well as in the East. Theodosius died in 450,\r\nwithout having made any arrangements for a successor.\r\n\r\n*Marcian, 450–57 A. D.* The officials left the choice of a new emperor to\r\nthe Augusta Pulcheria. She selected Marcian, a tried officer, to whom she\r\ngave her hand in formal marriage. Marcian proved himself an able and\r\nconscientious ruler. He refused to continue the indemnity to Attila, and\r\nwas able to adhere to this policy owing to the latter’s invasion of the\r\nWest and subsequent death. It was he who permitted the Ostrogoths to\r\nsettle as _foederati_ in Pannonia (454 A. D.).\r\n\r\n*Leo I, 457–474 A. D.* At the death of Marcian in 457 the imperial\r\nauthority was conferred upon Leo, an officer of Dacian origin. His\r\nappointment was due to the Alan Aspar, one of the masters of the soldiers,\r\nwhose power in the East rivalled that of Ricimer in the West. But Leo did\r\nnot intend to be the puppet of the powerful general, whose loyalty he\r\neventually came to suspect. Accordingly as a counterpoise to the Gothic\r\nmercenaries and _foederati_, the mainstay of Aspar’s power, he drew into\r\nhis service the Isaurians, the warlike mountaineers of southern Anatolia,\r\nwho had defied the empire under Arcadius and Theodosius. The emperor’s\r\neldest daughter was given in marriage to Zeno, an Isaurian, who was made\r\nmaster of the soldiers in the Orient. However, in 470 Aspar was still\r\nstrong enough to force Leo to bestow the hand of his second daughter upon\r\nhis son Leontius and to appoint the latter Caesar. But in the following\r\nyear when Zeno returned to Constantinople the Alan and his eldest sons\r\nwere treacherously assassinated in the palace.\r\n\r\n*Leo II, 473–4 A. D.* In 473 Leo took as his colleague and destined\r\nsuccessor his grandson, also called Leo, the son of Zeno. The death of the\r\nelder Leo occurred early in 474, and the younger soon crowned his father\r\nZeno as co-emperor. When Leo II died before the close of the same year,\r\nZeno became sole ruler.\r\n\r\n*Zeno, 474–491 A. D.* The reign of Zeno was an almost uninterrupted\r\nstruggle against usurpers and revolting Gothic _foederati_. In 474\r\noccurred an outbreak of the latter led by their king Theodoric the son of\r\nTriarius, called Strabo or “the Squinter,” who ruled over the Goths\r\nsettled in Thrace as a master of the soldiers of the empire. Before this\r\nrevolt was over, the unpopularity of the Isaurians induced Basiliscus, the\r\nbrother-in-law of Leo I, to plot to seize the throne for himself. He was\r\nsupported by his sister, the ex-empress Verina, and Illus, the chief\r\nIsaurian officer in Zeno’s service. The conspirators seized Constantinople\r\nand proclaimed Basiliscus emperor (475 A. D.). But his heretical religious\r\nviews aroused strong opposition, and he was deserted by both Verina and\r\nIllus. Zeno re-entered the capital and Basiliscus was executed.\r\n\r\nDuring the revolt Zeno had been supported by Theoderic the Amal, a Gothic\r\nprince who was a rival of Theoderic son of Triarius. The emperor therefore\r\ntried to crush the latter with the help of the former, but the two\r\nTheoderics came to an agreement and acted in concert against Zeno (478\r\nA. D.). In 479 peace was made with Strabo, but hostilities continued with\r\nthe Amal. At this time another insurrection broke out in Constantinople,\r\nunder the leadership of Marcian, a son-in-law of Leo I, as a protest\r\nagainst the predominance of the Isaurians, in particular Illus. However,\r\nthis revolt was easily put down.\r\n\r\nTheoderic son of Triarius was killed in 481, and in 483 Zeno made peace\r\nwith Theoderic the Amal, creating him patrician and master of the\r\nsoldiers, and granting him lands in Dacia and lower Moesia. These\r\nconcessions were made in consequence of the antagonism which had developed\r\nbetween the emperor and his all-powerful minister Illus. This friction\r\nculminated in 484 A. D. when Illus, who was master of the soldiers in the\r\nOrient, induced the dowager empress Verina to crown a general, named\r\nLeontius, as emperor. But outside of Isauria the movement found little\r\nsupport and after a long siege in an Isaurian fortress the leaders of the\r\nrevolt were taken and put to death (488 A. D.). In the meantime Theoderic\r\nthe Amal had asked and received an imperial warrant for the conquest of\r\nItaly, and with the departure of the Goths the eastern empire was\r\ndelivered from the danger of Germanic domination. Zeno died in April, 491\r\nA. D.\r\n\r\n*Anastasius, 491–518 A. D.* The choice of a successor was left to the\r\nempress Ariadne, who selected as emperor and her husband an experienced\r\nofficer of the court, Anastasius. The first act of Anastasius was to\r\nremove the Isaurian officials and troops from Constantinople. This led to\r\nan Isaurian rebellion in southern Asia Minor which was not stamped out\r\nuntil 498. In the struggle the power of the Isaurians was broken, their\r\nstrongholds were captured, part of their population transported to Thrace,\r\nand they ceased to be a menace to the peace of the empire.\r\n\r\nIn the place of the Goths new enemies appeared on the Danubian border in\r\nthe Slavic Getae and the Bulgars who overran the depopulated provinces of\r\nthe northern Balkan peninsula. So extended were their ravages and so\r\nutterly did the imperial troops fail to hold them in check that Anastasius\r\nwas obliged to build a wall across the peninsula, upon which the city of\r\nConstantinople stands, for the protection of the capital itself.\r\nAnastasius had also to cope with a serious Persian war which began with an\r\ninvasion of Roman Armenia and Mesopotamia by King Kawad in 502 A. D. After\r\nfour years of border warfare, in which the Persians gained initial success\r\nbut the fortune of the Roman arms was restored by the master of the\r\noffices Celer, peace was reëstablished on the basis of the _status quo\r\nante_.\r\n\r\nThe civil administration of Anastasius is noteworthy for the abolition of\r\nthe tax called the _chrysargyrum_ (498 A. D.), and his relief of the\r\n_curiales_ from the responsibility for the collection of the municipal\r\ntaxes. A testimony of the increasing influences of Christian morality was\r\nthe abolition of certain pagan festivals and of combats between gladiators\r\nand wild beasts in the circus.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of the justness and efficiency of his administration the\r\nreign of Anastasius was marked by several popular upheavals in\r\nConstantinople, and in other cities of the empire as well. The cause lay\r\nin his sympathy for the monophysite doctrine which was vigorously opposed\r\nby the orthodox Christians. In 512 the appointment of a monophysite bishop\r\nat Constantinople provoked a serious rebellion which almost cost\r\nAnastasius his throne.\r\n\r\nAlthough the emperor was able to quiet the city rabble by a display of\r\ncool courage the prevailing religious discord encouraged Vitalian, the\r\ncommander of the Bulgarian _foederati_ in the Thracian army, to raise the\r\nstandard of revolt (514 A. D.). He defeated all forces sent against him\r\nand endangered the safety of the capital. However, he was induced to\r\nwithdraw by a ransom of 5000 pounds of gold and the office of master of\r\nthe soldiers in Thrace. But the truce was only temporary, and in 515 he\r\nagain advanced on Constantinople. This time his forces met with a crushing\r\ndefeat on land and sea, and the rebellion came to an end. Three years\r\nlater Anastasius died.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: The Roman Empire and the Germanic Kingdoms in 526\r\n  A. D.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n\r\n                   THE AGE OF JUSTINIAN: 518–565 A. D.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            I. THE GERMANIC KINGDOMS IN THE WEST TO 533 A. D.\r\n\r\n\r\n*The Germans and the Romans.* The passing of Italy and the western\r\nprovinces under the sway of Germanic kings was accomplished, as we have\r\nseen, by the settlement of large numbers of barbarians in the conquered\r\nterritories. This necessitated a division of the soil and a definition of\r\nthe status of the Romans with respect to the invaders, who were everywhere\r\nless numerous than the native population. These questions were settled in\r\ndifferent ways in the several kingdoms.\r\n\r\n*Under the Visigoths.* In the Visigothic kingdom in Gaul the Goths and the\r\nRomans lived side by side as separate peoples, each enjoying its own laws,\r\nand the Romans were not regarded as subjects having no rights against\r\ntheir conquerors. However, intermarriage between the two races was\r\nforbidden. The law which applied to the Romans was published by King\r\nAlaric in 506 A. D., and is known as the _Lex Romana Visigothorum_, or the\r\nBreviary of Alaric; his predecessor Euric had caused the compilation of a\r\ncode of the Gothic customary law in imitation of the imperial Theodosian\r\ncode.\r\n\r\nThe settlement of the Goths on the land took the form of _hospitium_ or\r\nquartering. By this arrangement the Roman landholders gave up to the Goths\r\ntwo thirds of their property, both the land itself and the cattle,\r\n_coloni_ and slaves which were on it. The shares which the Goths received\r\nwere not subject to taxation.\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of administration the Roman provincial and municipal\r\ndivisions were retained (_provinciae_ and _civitates_), the former being\r\nplaced under _duces_ and the latter under _comites civitatum_. The Goths\r\nsettled within these districts formed their national associations of tens,\r\nhundreds, and thousands, under native Gothic officers. But the adoption of\r\na more settled form of life deeply affected the Gothic tribal\r\ninstitutions. The Gothic national assembly could no longer be easily\r\ncalled together and came to exist in the form of the army alone. In the\r\ndivision of the land the more influential warriors and friends of the king\r\nreceived the larger shares and this helped the rise of a landed nobility.\r\nThe government was concentrated at the capital, Toulouse, where central\r\nministries were established modelled on those of the Roman court. This led\r\nto a considerable strengthening of the royal power. The language of\r\ngovernment remained Gothic for the Goths and Latin for the Romans, but the\r\nleading Goths appear to have been familiar with both tongues.\r\n\r\n*Under the Vandals.* In the Vandal kingdom of Africa the position of the\r\nRomans was much less favorable. They were treated as conquered subjects,\r\nand, as under the Goths, intermarriage between them and the conquering\r\nrace was prohibited. In the province of Zeugitana (old Africa), where the\r\nVandal settlement occurred, the Roman landowners were completely\r\ndispossessed and their estates turned over to new proprietors. The\r\n_coloni_ and other tenants, however, remained on the soil, and the Vandal\r\nlandlords entrusted the management of their properties to Roman stewards.\r\nElsewhere the Romans were undisturbed in their possessions.\r\n\r\nThe Roman administrative territorial divisions were retained, but the\r\nregions settled by the Vandals stood outside of these and had a separate\r\norganization. Here the Vandals preserved their tribal divisions of\r\nhundreds and thousands. The administration of justice for the Vandals was\r\nin the hands of their own officials and according to their customary laws;\r\nfor the Romans it rested with their previous authorities in accordance\r\nwith Roman law but under the supervision of the Vandal king.\r\n\r\nThe Vandal kingdom was a strongly centralized monarchy. This led to the\r\ndevelopment of a nobility based on employment in the imperial service. The\r\nAfrican climate and the sudden acquirement of wealth which enabled them to\r\nenjoy all the luxurious extravagance of Roman life in the upper classes of\r\nsociety soon produced an enervating effect upon the northern conquerors.\r\nOn the other hand, although they were completely lacking in political\r\nrights, the Roman agricultural population of Africa felt the rule of the\r\nVandals to be less oppressive than that of the Roman bureaucracy.\r\n\r\n*Under the Ostrogoths.* In Italy, Odovacar had maintained the Roman\r\nadministrative system in its entirety and Theoderic continued his policy.\r\nHe made no attempt to found a new state but regarded himself as one of the\r\nrulers of the Roman empire. In 497 he asked and received from Anastasius\r\nthe symbols of imperial power which Odovacar had sent to Constantinople\r\nupon the deposition of Romulus Augustulus in 476. From this time the\r\nGothic king may be regarded as a colleague of the eastern emperor. Not\r\nmerely did he retain the Roman administrative organization but all his\r\ncivil officials were Romans. He published an edict which constituted a\r\ncode of law applicable to Goths and Romans alike. So thoroughly Roman was\r\nTheoderic’s administration that even the army was open to Romans, who are\r\nfound among his prominent generals.\r\n\r\nThe Ostrogoths received assignments of land in Italy but it seems probable\r\nthat there was no confiscation of private property, one third of the state\r\nlands being allotted for this purpose. Ravenna was the royal residence and\r\ncenter of government, but the Roman Senate exercised a great deal of\r\ninfluence and until the later years of his reign cordially supported the\r\nauthority of Theoderic.\r\n\r\n*The Burgundians and the Franks.* The Burgundians in the Rhone valley\r\neffected their settlement like the Visigoths according to the system of\r\n_hospitium_. In general their relations with the Roman population were\r\npeaceful, intermarriage between the two peoples was sanctioned, and the\r\nBurgundian kings showed themselves appreciative of Roman culture.\r\nGundobad, who reigned from 473 to 516, issued both a code of Burgundian\r\nlaws and the Burgundian Roman Law (_Lex Romana Burgundionum_) which\r\napplied to his Roman subjects and also to the Burgundians in their\r\ndisputes with Romans. The Franks in the course of their advance to the\r\nSeine had annihilated the Roman population of northern Gaul. However, in\r\nthe region between the Seine and the Loire they left the Romans in\r\nundisturbed possession of their property, the Frankish kings making no\r\ndistinction between their Frank and Roman subjects.\r\n\r\n*The religious question.* In addition to racial differences, there was\r\nalso a religious line of demarcation between the Goths, Vandals and\r\nBurgundians on the one hand, and the Roman population on the other. The\r\nGoths and neighboring Germanic peoples had been converted to Christianity\r\nin the latter half of the fourth century, largely through the missionary\r\nactivities of Ulfila, who translated the Bible into Gothic. However, they\r\nhad been won to the Arian and not the Nicaean creed, and consequently were\r\nregarded as heretics by the orthodox Romans, who never became reconciled\r\nto rulers of another confession than themselves. This hostility led\r\nfrequently to government intervention and persecution. But in this respect\r\nthe policy of the several Germanic kingdoms varied under different rulers.\r\n\r\nIn general the Visigoths pursued a policy of toleration, leaving the\r\northodox clergy undisturbed except when the latter were guilty of\r\ndisloyalty in giving support to outside enemies. At the time of their\r\nsettlement in Zeugitana the Vandals confiscated the property of the\r\northodox church in that province and turned it over to their own Arian\r\nclergy. Elsewhere in Africa the Catholics remained unmolested during the\r\nreign of Gaiseric but were persecuted by his successors. In the\r\nOstrogothic kingdom in Italy Theoderic, although an Arian, gave complete\r\nfreedom to the orthodox church throughout the greater part of his rule.\r\nHowever, his policy changed when the eastern emperor, Justin, began to\r\npersecute the Arians within his dominions in 523 A. D. The ban upon\r\nArianism found support among the Romans in Italy, particularly among the\r\northodox clergy and the senators. This caused Theoderic to suspect that\r\nthe emperor’s action had been stimulated by a faction in the Roman Senate,\r\nand led to the execution of Boethius and other notables on the charge of\r\ntreason. Realizing the effect that the imperial proscription of Arianism\r\nwould produce upon the relations of his Roman and Gothic subjects,\r\nTheoderic sent a delegation, headed by the bishop of Rome, to\r\nConstantinople to secure the annulment of the anti-Arian decree. When he\r\nfailed to attain this, he resolved upon a general persecution of the\r\nCatholics which was forestalled, however, by his death in 526 A. D.\r\n\r\nThe Burgundians were also Arians, and this prevented their winning the\r\nloyal support of the orthodox clergy, who, however, recognized the\r\nauthority of the Burgundian kings. Although Sigismund, the son of\r\nGundobad, who came to the throne in 516, was converted to orthodoxy, it\r\nwas too late to heal this religious breach before the fall of the\r\nBurgundian power.\r\n\r\nUnlike their neighbors, the Visigoths and Burgundians, the Franks were\r\npagans when they established themselves upon Roman territory and remained\r\nso until toward the close of the fifth century. In 496 the Frankish king\r\nClovis was converted to Christianity, and to the orthodox, not the Arian,\r\nbelief, a fact of supreme importance in his relations with the other\r\nGermanic peoples in Gaul.\r\n\r\n*The expansion of the Franks.* The foreign policy of Theoderic was\r\ndirected towards strengthening his position in Italy by establishing\r\nfriendly relations with the western Germanic kingdoms and maintaining\r\npeace and a balance of power among them. To this end he contracted a\r\nseries of family alliances with the rulers of these states. In 492 he\r\nhimself wedded a sister of Clovis the Frank, and gave his own sister in\r\nmarriage to the Vandal king Thrasamund. One of his daughters became the\r\nwife of Sigismund, king of the Burgundians, and another was married to\r\nAlaric II, who succeeded Euric as king of the Visigoths.\r\n\r\nHowever, Theoderic’s scheme was rudely disturbed by the ambitions of\r\nClovis. In 496 the latter conquered the Alamanni. He next forced the\r\nBurgundians to acknowledge his overlordship, and with these as his allies\r\nin 507 he attacked the Visigothic kingdom. The conquests of Euric in Gaul\r\nand Spain had overtaxed the strength of the Visigothic people and weakened\r\ntheir hold upon the territory they occupied. Furthermore, their Roman\r\nsubjects gave active aid to the orthodox Clovis. In a battle near Poitiers\r\nthe Visigoths were defeated and their king, Alaric II, slain. Theoderic\r\nhad been hindered from intervening previously by the outbreak of\r\nhostilities between himself and the emperor Anastasius, who gave his\r\nsanction to the action of Clovis and sent him the insignia of the\r\nconsulship. Now, however, the Ostrogothic king came to the aid of the\r\nVisigoths. He repulsed the Franks and Burgundians before Arles (508\r\nA. D.). and recovered Narbonese Gaul. However, the greater part of\r\nAquitania remained in the hands of the Franks. Theoderic established his\r\ngrandson Amalaric as king of the Visigoths and exercised a regency in his\r\nname (510 A. D.). Clovis died in 511 and the expansion of the Franks\r\nceased for a time. However, the death of Theoderic in 526 was the signal\r\nfor fresh disturbances. The Visigothic king Amalaric at once asserted his\r\nindependence in southern Gaul and in Spain. But not long afterwards, in\r\n531, he fell in battle against the Franks, who seized the remaining\r\nVisigothic possessions in Gaul except Septimania—the coast district\r\nbetween the Pyrenees and the Rhone. Three years later they overthrew the\r\nkingdom of the Burgundians and so brought under their sway the whole of\r\nGaul outside of Septimania and Provence.\r\n\r\nIn 533 A. D. the situation in the west was as follows. Gaul was mainly in\r\nthe hands of the Franks, Spain was under the Visigoths, the Vandals were\r\nstill established in Africa, and the Ostrogoths in Italy. Both of the\r\nlatter kingdoms, however, were showing signs of internal weakness. In\r\naddition to the hostility between the Germanic conquerors and the subject\r\nRoman population, factional strife had broken out over the succession to\r\nthe throne. Evidence of the declining power of the Vandals in particular\r\nwas the success of the Moorish tribes in winning their independence. By\r\n525 both Mauretania and Numidia had been abandoned to them, and the tribes\r\nof Tripolis had shaken off the Vandal yoke. In 530 the Moors of southern\r\nByzacene inflicted a severe defeat on the Vandals, which led to the\r\ndeposition of the ruling king. The weakness of these states seemed to\r\noffer a favorable opportunity for the reëstablishment of the imperial\r\nauthority in the West.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   II. THE RESTORATION OF THE IMPERIAL POWER IN THE WEST: 553–554 A. D.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Justin I, 518–527 A. D.* Anastasius died in 518 and was succeeded by\r\nJustin, an Illyrian of humble origin who had risen to the important post\r\nof commander of the imperial body guard (_comes excubitorum_). Unlike his\r\npredecessor Justin was an adherent of the orthodox faith, and at the\r\nopening of his reign an exceedingly influential position was held by the\r\ngeneral Vitalian, who had been the champion of orthodoxy against\r\nAnastasius. He became master of the soldiers at Constantinople and in 520\r\nwas honored with the consulship. But his power and unscrupulous ambitions\r\nconstituted a real menace to the emperor and induced the latter to procure\r\nhis murder. Justin ruled for nine years. He was an experienced soldier,\r\nbut illiterate, and personally unequal to the task of imperial government.\r\nThe guiding spirit of his administration was his nephew Justinian, who was\r\nlargely responsible for Vitalian’s removal. In fact the reign of Justin\r\nserved as a brief introduction to the long rule of Justinian himself, whom\r\nhis uncle crowned as his colleague in 527 A. D., and who became sole\r\nemperor at the latter’s death in the same year.\r\n\r\n*Justinian’s imperial policy.* Justinian was by birth a Latin peasant from\r\nnear Scupi (modern Uskub) in Upper Moesia, but through his uncle he had\r\nbeen able to enjoy all the educational advantages offered by the schools\r\nof Constantinople. In public life he showed himself a laborious and\r\ncareful administrator, of an extremely autocratic, and yet at the same\r\ntime somewhat vacillating, character. He was a devout Christian, zealous\r\nfor the propagation of the orthodox faith, with a strong liking for, and\r\nconsiderable learning in, questions of dogmatic theology. He regarded\r\nreligious and secular affairs as equally subject to the imperial will, and\r\nin each sphere he exercised absolute authority. In him the ideal of\r\nautocracy found its most perfect embodiment.\r\n\r\nThe goal of Justinian’s imperial policy was the recovery of the lands of\r\nthe western empire from their Germanic rulers and the reëstablishment of\r\nimperial unity in the person of the eastern emperor. The attainment of\r\nunity of belief throughout the Christian world he regarded as no less\r\nimportant than that of political unity: one empire, one church, was his\r\nmotto.\r\n\r\n*Reconciliation with the western Church: 519 A. D.* The way was paved for\r\nthe reconquest of the Roman West by a reconciliation with the Roman bishop\r\nHormisdas, as a result of which orthodoxy was once more formally received\r\nat Constantinople and a persecution of the monophysites and other heretics\r\ninaugurated in the eastern empire (519 A. D.). Although this union with\r\nRome was brought about while the influence of Vitalian was predominant, it\r\nhad the cordial support of Justinian, who recognized that the good will of\r\nthe clergy and the Roman population of the western provinces would in this\r\nway be won for the eastern emperor. Such proved to be the case, and the\r\nsubsequent wars for the recovery of the West assumed the aspect of\r\ncrusades for the deliverance of the followers of the orthodox church from\r\nArian domination.\r\n\r\n*Outbreak of the Vandal war, 533 A. D.* The deposition of Hilderic, who\r\nhad been on friendly terms with the eastern empire, and the accession of\r\nGelimer who reverted to an anti-Roman policy, afforded Justinian a pretext\r\nfor intervention in the Vandal kingdom. In conformity with his policy of\r\ntreating the Germanic kings as vassal princes of the empire, he demanded\r\nthe reinstatement of Hilderic, and when this was refused, he prepared to\r\ninvade Africa. An expeditionary force of ten thousand foot and five\r\nthousand horse, accompanied by a powerful fleet, was placed under the\r\ncommand of the able general Belisarius and despatched from Constantinople\r\nin 533 A. D. An alliance concluded with the Ostrogoths forestalled the\r\npossibility of their coming to the aid of the Vandals.\r\n\r\n*The military condition of the empire.* The imperial armies of the sixth\r\ncentury were entirely composed of mercenary troops. While the voluntary\r\nenlistment of barbarians had been a regular method of recruitment from the\r\ntime of Diocletian, such troops were at first enrolled directly in the\r\nimperial service. But by the opening of the sixth century it had become\r\ncustomary for private individuals, as a rule officers of repute, to enlist\r\ntroops in their personal service. Such troops were known as _bucellarii_,\r\nfrom the word _bucella_, signifying soldiers’ bread. These _bucellarii_\r\nwere usually taken into the service of the state along with their leaders,\r\nand were then maintained at the public expense. It was with mercenaries of\r\nthis type that the ranks of Justinian’s armies were largely filled. For\r\nthe most part they were veteran troops and good fighters, but with all the\r\nweaknesses of their class. They were greedy of plunder, impatient of\r\ndiscipline, and both officers and men displayed a conspicuous lack of\r\nloyalty. The most effective troops were the _cataphracti_, mailed horsemen\r\narmed with bow, lance and sword. Beside them the infantry played only a\r\nsubordinate rôle. The fact that the government was obliged to rely upon\r\n_condottieri_ for its own maintenance reveals the internal decay of the\r\nwhole imperial system, and the smallness of the forces which it could put\r\ninto the field shows the weakness of its resources compared with the aims\r\nof Justinian and explains the protracted character of the wars of the\r\nperiod. In fact, the emperor was on the point of abandoning the invasion\r\nof Africa for financial reasons, when the prophecy of an eastern bishop\r\ninduced him to persevere.\r\n\r\n*The reconquest of Africa, 533–4 A. D.* The landing of Belisarius in\r\nAfrica (September, 533) completely surprised the Vandals. Gailimer was\r\ndefeated in battle and Belisarius occupied Carthage. A second defeat\r\nbefore the close of the year sealed the fate of the Vandal kingdom. Early\r\nin 534 Gailimer surrendered and all resistance came to an end. The Vandal\r\ninsular possessions—Sardinia, Corsica and the Balearic Islands—fell to the\r\nRomans without further opposition.\r\n\r\n*Revolts of the Moors.* However, the Moors, who had managed to assert\r\ntheir independence against the Vandals, were not disposed to pass under\r\nthe Roman yoke without a struggle. A revolt which broke out in 535 was not\r\nfinally crushed until 539; and another, which was complicated by a mutiny\r\nof the imperial troops, raged between 546 and 548. In the end, the Roman\r\nauthority was reëstablished over all the African provinces except\r\nMauretania Caesariensis and Tingitana. The previous system of civil\r\nadministration was revived and elaborate measures taken to secure the\r\ndefence of the frontiers. However, the ravages of the Moors and the war of\r\nrestoration had played sad havoc with economic conditions in Africa, and\r\nin spite of government assistance, its former prosperity was never\r\nrevived. Still, Africa had been recovered for the empire and was destined\r\nto remain a part of it until the Saracen invasion nearly a century and a\r\nhalf later.\r\n\r\n*The recovery of Italy, first phase, 535–540 A. D.* The overthrow of the\r\nVandal kingdom had scarcely been accomplished when events in Italy gave\r\nJustinian the desired pretext for the invasion of the peninsula. Upon the\r\ndeath of King Athalaric, Theoderic’s grandson and successor, in 534, his\r\nmother, the regent Amalasuntha, had married Theodahad, whom she made her\r\nconsort. Shortly afterwards, however, he caused her to be imprisoned and,\r\nwhen she appealed to Justinian for aid, put her to death. As the avenger\r\nof his former ally, Justinian made war upon the Gothic king. The\r\npossession of Africa gave the Romans an excellent base of operations\r\nagainst Italy. In 535 Belisarius invaded Sicily with 7500 men and speedily\r\nreduced the whole island, while another Roman army marched on Dalmatia.\r\nFrom Sicily Belisarius crossed into South Italy, where he found little\r\nresistance. The inactivity of Theodahad produced a revolt among his own\r\npeople. He was deposed, and Witiges became king in his place. The new king\r\nwas able to purchase the neutrality of the Franks, who were in alliance\r\nwith Justinian, by ceding to them the Ostrogothic possessions in South\r\nGaul. However, Belisarius continued his advance and occupied Rome\r\n(December, 536 A. D.). There he was besieged for a year (March, 537 to\r\nMarch, 538) by the Goths, who were in the end forced to abandon the\r\nblockade and fall back upon North Italy. At the same time, the eunuch\r\nNarses arrived in Italy at the head of a new Roman army. But since his\r\npresence was largely due to Justinian’s mistrust of Belisarius, he failed\r\nto coöperate with the latter and accomplished nothing before his recall in\r\n539. The last episode of the campaign was the siege of Ravenna (539–540\r\nA. D.), which was defended by the Gothic king. With its fall and his\r\ncapture in 540, the resistance of the Goths came to an end. Italy was\r\ndeclared a Roman province, the civil administration was reëstablished, and\r\nBelisarius was recalled to assume the command against Persia.\r\n\r\n*Second phase, 541–554 A. D.* But the withdrawal of Belisarius and his\r\nbest troops led to a revolt of the Goths under the leadership of the brave\r\nand energetic Totila (or Baduila) in 541. Within the next three years he\r\ndrove the Roman garrisons from the greater part of Italy, including Rome.\r\nBelisarius was despatched against him, but was given inadequate support\r\nand accomplished nothing except the recovery of Rome, which he held until\r\nhe was recalled at his own request in 548. The drain of a fresh Persian\r\nwar upon the resources of the empire forced Justinian to the temporary\r\nabandonment of Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily and Italy, apart from Ravenna and\r\na few other fortresses. At last in 552 he was able to resume the struggle\r\nand entrusted the conduct of the war to Narses, whose ability as a\r\ncommander was superior to that of Belisarius himself. The army of Narses\r\nnumbered over 30,000, and consisted chiefly of barbarian auxiliaries, in\r\nparticular Lombards, who had been settled as _foederati_ in Noricum since\r\n547. Narses marched upon Italy by way of Illyricum and reached the Roman\r\nbase at Ravenna. Thence he advanced towards Rome and met and defeated the\r\nGoths in a decisive engagement in Umbria (552 A. D.). Totila fell in the\r\nbattle. A second victory in Campania in the following spring forced the\r\nsurviving Goths to come to terms. They were allowed to leave Italy and\r\nseek a new home beyond the Roman borders. A fresh enemy then appeared in\r\nthe Franks, who had been nominal allies of the Goths but had rendered them\r\nlittle assistance. A horde of Alamanni and Franks swept down upon Italy\r\nand penetrated deep into the peninsula. But Narses annihilated one of\r\ntheir divisions at Capua (554 A. D.), and the remainder were decimated by\r\ndisease and forced to withdraw. The Roman sway was firmly established over\r\nItaly as far as the Alps; but Raetia, Noricum and the Danubian provinces\r\nremained lost to the empire.\r\n\r\nThe long and bitter wars of restoration had wrought frightful damage to\r\nthe material welfare of Italy, and the heavy financial burdens imposed by\r\nthe Roman administrative system aroused bitter protests. The measures of\r\nrelief attempted proved insufficient, the middle class disappeared, the\r\nricher landed proprietors left the peninsula, and, as in Africa, the\r\nformer prosperity was never recalled.\r\n\r\n*The attempted recovery of Spain, 554 A. D.* Following the conclusion of\r\nhostilities in Italy, Justinian seized the opportunity which presented\r\nitself for intervention in Spain. He sent an army to the support of the\r\nrebel Agila against Athanagild, the king of the Visigoths (554 A. D.). The\r\nRoman forces occupied Corduba, Carthagena and other coast towns, but on\r\nthe death of Athanagild, Agila succeeded to his throne and headed the\r\nVisigothic opposition to the Romans, who were unable to advance further.\r\nHowever, they retained what they had already conquered.\r\n\r\n*Extent of the Roman conquests.* Justinian’s policy had resulted in the\r\noverthrow of the Vandal and Ostrogothic kingdoms, and in the recovery for\r\nthe empire of Africa, Italy, the Mediterranean islands, and a strip of the\r\nSpanish coast. More, the empire was too weak to accomplish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      III. JUSTINIAN’S FRONTIER PROBLEMS AND INTERNAL ADMINISTRATION\r\n\r\n\r\n*Barbarian invasions of the Balkan peninsula.* The strain which the policy\r\nof expansion in the West imposed upon the strength of the empire is\r\nclearly seen in the failure to defend the Danubian frontier and the\r\nineffective conduct of the Persian wars. Time after time hordes of Bulgars\r\nand Slavs poured into the Balkans. Especially destructive were the inroads\r\nof 540 and 559. In the former the invaders penetrated as far as the\r\nIsthmus of Corinth; in the latter they threatened the capital itself, but\r\nwere driven off by the aged Belisarius.\r\n\r\n*The Persian wars.* In 527, the Persian king Kawad declared war upon the\r\nempire. The struggle was indecisive, and, at the death of Kawad in 532,\r\nJustinian, who wished to be free at any price to pursue his western\r\npolicy, was able to conclude peace with his successor, Chosroes I, upon\r\ncondition of paying an annual indemnity. But the successes of Justinian in\r\nthe West aroused the jealousy and ambitions of Chosroes in 539. The\r\nPersians overran Syria and captured Antioch, carrying off its population\r\ninto captivity (540). However, they failed to take Edessa (544). In\r\nMesopotamia an armistice was concluded in 545, although war continued\r\nbetween the Arab dependents of both states, and in the district of Lazica\r\n(ancient Colchis), a Roman protectorate which transferred its allegiance\r\nto Persia. Finally, a fifty years’ peace was concluded in 562 A. D. The\r\nRoman suzerainty over Lazica was acknowledged by the Persians, but the\r\nRomans obligated themselves to pay the Persians a heavy annual subsidy, in\r\nreturn for which the Persians undertook the defence of the Caucasus. In\r\nthis way the Persians became technically Roman _foederati_; however, as in\r\nthe case of the Visigoths in the fourth century, this was equivalent to a\r\nconfession that the Romans were unable to subdue their enemy, who looked\r\nupon the subsidy as tribute.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: The Roman Empire in 565 A. D.]\r\n\r\n*The empress Theodora.* In 523 Justinian married Theodora, a former\r\nprofessional pantomime actress from the purlieus of the Hippodrome, after\r\nhe had induced his uncle to cancel the law which forbade the marriage of\r\nsenators and actresses. And when Justinian became emperor in 527, Theodora\r\nwas crowned with him as Augusta. From that time until her death in 553 she\r\nwas in a very real sense joint ruler with her husband. Whatever the\r\ncharacter of her previous career, her private life as empress was beyond\r\nreproach. She was fond of power, jealous of the influence of others with\r\nthe emperor, and unforgiving towards those who thwarted her purposes; both\r\nBelisarius and John of Cappadocia, the powerful praetorian prefect, were\r\ndriven from the emperor’s service by her enmity. On the other hand, she\r\nwas a woman of dauntless courage, and possessed of remarkable foresight in\r\npolitical affairs.\r\n\r\n*The **“**Nika**”** riot, 532 A. D.* The courage of the empress was\r\nconspicuously displayed on the occasion of the great riot of the factions\r\nof the Hippodrome—the Greens and the Blues—in 532 A. D. These factions had\r\nbeen organized in Constantinople in imitation of the circus factions of\r\nRome, but had acquired a different character and a greater importance in\r\nthe new capital. The two factions divided between them the entire urban\r\npopulation, and had their regularly appointed leaders, who enjoyed a\r\nrecognized place in the administrative organization of the city. These\r\nparties may be regarded as the last survival of the Hellenic popular\r\nassembly of the city-state, and owing to the extreme centralization of the\r\nadministration at Constantinople, they were able to exercise considerable\r\npressure upon the government.\r\n\r\nThe emperor and the court regularly supported one or other of the parties.\r\nAnastasius had favored the Greens, but Justinian was a partizan of the\r\nBlues. The rivalry of the factions was intense, and culminated, in the\r\nearly years of Justinian’s reign, in open warfare, which gave the lower\r\nelements the opportunity for the perpetration of crimes of all sorts. The\r\npunishment of notorious criminals of both factions in 532 led to their\r\nuniting in a revolt which nearly cost the emperor his throne. At first the\r\nmob demanded the release of their partizans, and the dismissal of John,\r\nthe praetorian prefect, whose financial policy was extremely oppressive,\r\nof Trebonian, the able but unscrupulous quaestor, and of the prefect of\r\nthe city. Later, emboldened by their success, they crowned as emperor\r\nHypatius, a nephew of Anastasius. The situation became extremely critical,\r\nfor, with the exception of the palace, the whole city fell into the hands\r\nof the rebels, whose battle cry was “Nika” or “Conquer.” Justinian and his\r\ncouncillors had already resolved upon flight, when Theodora, by a spirited\r\nspeech in which she declared that she would die before abandoning the\r\ncapital, reanimated their hearts and induced them to alter their decision.\r\nBy a judicious use of bribes they induced the Blues to desert the Greens,\r\nand the imperial troops exacted a bloody vengeance from the rebellious\r\npopulace. For the future the population of the capital was politically a\r\nnegligible quantity.\r\n\r\n*The codification of the Roman law.* One of the greatest monuments to the\r\nreign of Justinian is the _corpus iuris civilis_, a codification of the\r\nRoman law by a commission of expert jurists, headed by Trebonian. The\r\nobject of this codification was the collection in a convenient form of all\r\nthe sources of law then in force, and the settlement of controversies in\r\nthe interpretative juristic literature. The compilation was divided into\r\nthree parts; the _Code of Justinian_, the _Digest_ or _Pandects_, and the\r\n_Institutes_. The _Code_ was a collection of all imperial constitutions of\r\ngeneral validity; it was first published in 529, but a revised edition was\r\nissued in 534. The _Digest_, which was issued in 533, consisted of\r\nabstracts from the writings of the most famous Roman jurists\r\nsystematically arranged so as to present the whole civil law in so far as\r\nit was not contained in the _Code_. The _Institutes_ was a brief manual\r\ndesigned as a text-book for the use of students of the law. From the time\r\nof their promulgation these compilations constituted the sole law of the\r\nempire and alone carried validity in the courts and formed the only\r\nmaterial for instruction in the law schools of recognized status—those at\r\nRome, Constantinople and Berytus. Provision was made for the publication\r\nof future legislation in a fourth compilation—the _Novels_ or _New\r\nConstitutions_.\r\n\r\n*St. Sophia.* Justinian’s administration was characterized by great\r\nbuilding activity. He was zealous in the construction of frontier\r\ndefences, the rebuilding of ruined cities, the founding of new ones, and\r\nthe erection of religious edifices. Among the latter the most famous was\r\nthe great church of the Holy Wisdom (St. Sophia), which took the place of\r\nan older building destroyed in the Nika riot. Transformed into a\r\nMohammedan mosque, it remains to the present day as the greatest\r\narchitectural monument of the eastern Roman empire. The execution of\r\ngrandiose works of this sort augmented the heavy expenditures necessitated\r\nby Justinian’s foreign policy, and required the continual wringing of\r\nfresh contributions from the already overburdened taxpayers. In raising\r\nthe revenues needed to meet the demands upon the fiscus, the emperor found\r\nthe prefect John an invaluable agent.\r\n\r\n*Justinian’s religious policy.* Throughout the whole of his reign\r\nJustinian strove with unflagging zeal to secure a united Christian church\r\nwithin the empire. To this end he did not hesitate to make use of the\r\nautocratic power which he claimed in religious as well as secular affairs\r\nand which was formally admitted by the synod of 536, which declared that\r\n“Nothing whatsoever may occur in the church contrary to the wishes and\r\norders of the emperor.” His own views Justinian set forth in extensive\r\nwritings on dogmatic questions. The reconciliation with Rome in 519, so\r\nnecessary for the recovery of the West, had alienated the Monophysites,\r\nwho were predominant in Egypt, Syria and Mesopotamia, especially among the\r\nlower classes of society. For the rest of his reign Justinian strove\r\nindefatigably to heal this breach, a policy in which he was largely\r\ninfluenced by Theodora, who was personally sympathetic with the\r\nMonophysites and saw the danger to the empire in the continued hostility\r\nof the eastern peoples. An ecumenical council summoned by him at\r\nConstantinople in 553 accepted a formula of belief upon which he hoped\r\nboth orthodox and monophysites could unite. The Pope Vergilius was forced\r\nto submit to Justinian’s will, but the clergy of Italy and Africa regarded\r\nthe new doctrine as heretical, and some openly condemned it. Nor was the\r\ndesired end attained, for the Monophysites still refused to be\r\nconciliated. A final edict, issued in 565, went still further in its\r\nrecognition of the tenets of this sect, but the emperor’s death\r\nforestalled its enforcement and saved the orthodox clergy from the\r\nalternative of submission or persecution.\r\n\r\nA far harsher treatment was meted out to the Arians, who were treated as\r\nhereticals and punished as criminals. A rebellion of the Samaritans,\r\noccasioned by their persecution, was stamped out in blood. A determined\r\neffort was made to eradicate the last remains of the old Hellenic faith\r\nwhich still claimed many adherents of note. In 529 the endowment of\r\nPlato’s Academy was confiscated and the teaching of philosophy forbidden\r\nat Athens. The persecution of heretics and unbelievers was accompanied by\r\na vigorous missionary movement which carried the Christian gospel to the\r\npeoples of southern Russia, the Caucasus, Arabia, the Soudan and the oases\r\nof the Sahara.\r\n\r\n*The **condition** of the empire at the death of Justinian.* Justinian\r\ndied on 14 November, 565 A. D. He left the empire completely exhausted by\r\nthe conquest of the western provinces. The national antagonism between\r\nGreeks and Romans which was coming more and more clearly to light was not\r\neffectively bridged by a formal church union, and a mistaken religious\r\npolicy had fostered the growth of national ambitions among the native\r\npopulations of Syria and Egypt and led to further disunion with the\r\nempire. Under Justinian the annual consulship, for a thousand years\r\nidentified with the life of the Roman state, was abolished (540 A. D.). In\r\nthe government of the provinces Justinian took the initial steps towards\r\nabandoning the principle of the division of civil and military authority,\r\nwhich was so marked a feature of Diocletian’s organization, and thus\r\nprepared the way for the later form of the _themes_, or military\r\ndistricts, in which the military commanders were at the head of the civil\r\ngovernment as well. It was in his reign also that the culture of the\r\nsilkworm was introduced into the empire by Persian monks, who had lived in\r\nChina, learned the jealously guarded secrets of this art, and brought some\r\neggs of the silkworm out of the country concealed in hollow canes. The\r\nmanufacture of silk goods had long been a flourishing industry in certain\r\ncities of the Greek East and was made an imperial monopoly by Justinian.\r\nThe introduction of the silkworm rendered this trade to a large degree\r\nindependent of the importation of raw silk from the Orient.\r\n\r\nAs Justinian was the last emperor whose native tongue was Latin, so he was\r\nthe last who maintained that language as the language of government at\r\nConstantinople and upheld the traditions of the Roman imperial policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n\r\n            RELIGIOUS AND INTELLECTUAL LIFE IN THE LATE EMPIRE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          I. THE END OF PAGANISM\r\n\r\n\r\n*The paganism of the late empire.* In spite of the tremendous impulse\r\ngiven to the spread of Christianity by Constantine’s policy of toleration\r\nand by its adoption as the religion of the imperial house, the extinction\r\nof paganism was by no means rapid. While the chief pagan religions during\r\nthe fourth century were the Oriental cults and the Orphic mysteries of\r\nEleusis, which strongly resembled them in character, the worship of the\r\nGraeco-Roman Olympic divinities still attracted numerous followers. But,\r\nalthough paganism persisted in many and divers forms, these, by a process\r\nof religious syncretism, had come to find their place in a common\r\ntheological system. This development had its basis in the common\r\ncharacteristics of the Oriental cults, each of which inculcated the belief\r\nin a supreme deity, and received its stimulus through the conscious\r\nopposition of all forms of paganism to Christianity, which they had come\r\nto recognize as their common, implacable foe. The chief characteristic of\r\nlater paganism was its tendency to monotheism—a belief in one abstract\r\ndivinity of whom the various gods were but so many separate\r\nmanifestations. The development of a harmonious system of pagan theology\r\nwas greatly aided by Neoplatonic philosophy, which may be regarded as the\r\nultimate expression of ancient paganism. Neoplatonism was essentially a\r\npantheism, in which all forms of life were regarded as emanations of the\r\ndivine mind. But Neoplatonism was more than a philosophical system; it was\r\na religion, and, like the Oriental cults, preached a doctrine of salvation\r\nfor the souls of men. Such was the paganism by which the Christians of the\r\nlate empire were confronted, and which, because of its many points of\r\nresemblance to their own beliefs and practices, they admitted to be a\r\ndangerous rival. At the same time, this similarity made the task of\r\nconversion less difficult.\r\n\r\n*Causes of the persistence of paganism.* There were several reasons for\r\nthe persistence of paganism. The Oriental and Orphic cults exercised a\r\npowerful hold over their votaries, and made an appeal very similar to that\r\nof Christianity. Stoicism, with its high ideal of conduct, remained a\r\nstrong tradition among the upper classes of society; and Neoplatonism had\r\na special attraction for men of intelligence and culture. Roman\r\npatriotism, too, fostered loyalty to the gods under whose aegis Rome had\r\ngrown great, and until the close of the fourth century the Roman Senate\r\nwas an indefatigable champion of the ancient faith. But more potent than\r\nall these causes was the fact that, apart from some works of a theological\r\ncharacter, the whole literature of the day was pagan in origin and in\r\nspirit. This was the only material available for instruction in the\r\nschools, and formed the basis of the rhetorical studies which constituted\r\nthe higher education of the time. Thus, throughout the whole period of\r\ntheir intellectual training, the minds of the young were subjected to\r\npagan influences.\r\n\r\n*The persecution of paganism.* Constantine the Great adhered strictly to\r\nhis policy of religious toleration and, although an active supporter of\r\nChristianity, took no measures against the pagan cults except to forbid\r\nthe private sacrifices and practice of certain types of magical rites. He\r\nheld the title of pontifex maximus and consequently was at the head of the\r\nofficial pagan worship. With his sons, Constantius and Constans, the\r\nChristian persecution of the pagan began. In 341 they prohibited public\r\nperformance of pagan sacrifices, and they permitted the confiscation of\r\ntemples and their conversion into Christian places of worship. With the\r\naccession of Julian this persecution came to an end, and there was in the\r\nmain a return to the policy of religious toleration, although Christians\r\nwere prohibited from interpreting classical literature in the schools. The\r\nattempt of Julian to create a universal pagan church proved abortive and\r\nhis scheme did not survive his death. His successors, Jovian, Valentinian\r\nI and Valens, adhered to the policy of Constantine the Great.\r\n\r\nGratian was the first emperor to refuse the title of pontifex maximus, and\r\nto deprive paganism of its status as an official religion of Rome. In 382\r\nhe withdrew the state support of the priesthoods of Rome, and removed from\r\nthe Senate house the altar and statue of Victory, which Julian had\r\nrestored after its temporary removal by Constantius. This altar was for\r\nmany of the senators the symbol of the life of the state itself, and their\r\nspokesman Symmachus made an eloquent plea for its restoration. However,\r\nowing to the influence of Ambrose, the bishop of Milan, the emperor\r\nremained obdurate, and a second appeal to Valentinian II was equally in\r\nvain. Although the brief reign of Eugenius produced a pagan revival in\r\nRome, the cause of paganism was lost forever in the imperial city. In the\r\nfifth century the Senate of Rome was thoroughly Christian.\r\n\r\nTheodosius the Great was even more energetic than his colleague Gratian in\r\nthe suppression of paganism. In 380 he issued an edict requiring all his\r\nsubjects to embrace Christianity. In 391 he ordered the destruction of the\r\ngreat temple of Serapis at Alexandria, an event which sounded the death\r\nknell of the pagan cause in the East. The following year Theodosius\r\nabsolutely forbade the practice of heathen worship under the penalties for\r\ntreason and sacrilege. Theodosius II continued the vigorous persecution of\r\nthe heathen. Adherence to pagan beliefs constituted a crime, and in the\r\nTheodosian Code of 438 the laws against pagans find their place among the\r\nlaws regulating civic life. It was during the reign of Theodosius II, in\r\n415, that the pagan philosopher and mathematician, Hypatia, fell a victim\r\nto the fanaticism of the Christian mob of Alexandria.\r\n\r\nStill, many persons of prominence continued to be secret devotees of pagan\r\nbeliefs, and pagan philosophy was openly taught at Athens until the\r\nclosing of the schools by Justinian. The acceptance of Christianity was\r\nmore rapid in the cities than in the rural districts. This gave rise to\r\nthe use of the term pagan (from the Latin _paganus_, “rural”) to designate\r\nnon-Christian; a usage which became official about 370. And it was among\r\nthe rural population that pagan beliefs and practices persisted longest.\r\nHowever, between the fifth and the ninth centuries paganism practically\r\ndisappeared within the lands of the empire.\r\n\r\nThe long association with paganism and the rapid incorporation of large\r\nnumbers of new converts into the ranks of the church were not without\r\ninfluence upon the character of Christianity itself. The ancient belief in\r\nmagic contributed largely to the spread of the belief in miracles, and the\r\ndevelopment of the cult of the saints was stimulated by the pagan\r\nconception of inferior divinities, demigods, and daemons, while many pagan\r\nfestivals were Christianized and made festivals of the church.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  II. THE CHURCH IN THE CHRISTIAN EMPIRE\r\n\r\n\r\n*The emperor and the church.* The religious policy of Constantine the\r\nGreat had the effect of making Christianity a religion of state and\r\nincorporating the Christian church in the state organism. Thereby the\r\nclergy gained the support of the imperial authority in spreading the\r\nbelief of the church and in enforcing its ordinances throughout the\r\nempire. Yet this support was won at the price of the recognition of the\r\nautocratic power of the emperor over the church as well as in the\r\npolitical sphere. Subsequently, however, this recognition was only\r\naccorded to orthodox emperors; that is those who supported the traditional\r\ndoctrine of the church as sanctioned in its general councils.\r\n\r\nConstantine made use of his supremacy over the church to enforce unity\r\nwithin its ranks. However, he did not champion any particular creed but\r\nlimited his interference to carrying into effect the decisions of the\r\nchurch councils or synods which he summoned to pass judgment upon\r\nquestions which threatened the unity of the church and the peace of the\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nThese councils were a development from the provincial synods, which had\r\npreviously met to decide church matters of local importance. Procedure in\r\nthe councils was modelled upon that of the Roman Senate; the meetings were\r\nconducted by imperial legates, their decisions were issued in the form of\r\nimperial edicts, and it was to the emperor that appeals from these decrees\r\nwere made. The first of the great councils was the Synod of Arles, a\r\ncouncil of the bishops of the western church, summoned by Constantine in\r\n314 to settle the Donatist schism in the church in Africa. This was\r\nfollowed in 325 by the first universal or ecumenical council of the whole\r\nChristian church which met at Nicaea to decide upon the orthodoxy of the\r\nteachings of Arius of Alexandria.\r\n\r\nConstantine’s successors followed his example of summoning church councils\r\nto settle sectarian controversies, though, unlike him, many of them sought\r\nto force upon the church the doctrines of their particular sect. As the\r\ngeneral councils accentuated rather than allayed antagonisms, the eastern\r\nemperor Zeno substituted a referendum of the bishops by provinces. But\r\nthis precedent was not followed. Justinian was the emperor who asserted\r\nmost effectively his authority over the church. He issued edicts upon\r\npurely theological questions and upon matters of church discipline without\r\nreference to church councils, and he received from the populace of\r\nConstantinople the salutation of “High Priest and King.”(18) The decision\r\nof the council of 553 provoked an attack upon the sacerdotal power of the\r\nemperor by Facundus, bishop of Hermiana in Africa, who declared that not\r\nthe emperor but the priests should rule the church. Nevertheless, this\r\nopposition had no immediate effect, and Justinian remained the successful\r\nembodiment of “Caesaro-papism.”\r\n\r\n*The growth of the papacy.* The late empire witnessed a rapid extension of\r\nthe authority of the bishopric of Rome, which had even previously laid\r\nclaim to the primacy among the episcopal sees. In the West the title\r\n“pope” (from the Greek _pappas_, “father”) became the exclusive\r\nprerogative of the bishop of Rome. The papacy was the sole western\r\npatriarchate, or bishopric, with jurisdiction over the metropolitan and\r\nprovincial bishops, and was the sole representative of the western church\r\nin its dealings with the bishops of the East. At the council of Serdica\r\n(343 A. D.) it was decided that bishops deposed as a result of the Arian\r\ncontroversy might refer their cases to the Pope Julius for final decision,\r\nand, in the course of the fifth century, eastern bishops frequently\r\nappealed to the decision of the pope on questions of orthodoxy. However,\r\nthe eastern church never fully admitted the religious jurisdiction of the\r\npapacy. The ideal of the papacy became the organization of the church on\r\nthe model of the empire, with the pope as its religious head.\r\n\r\nThe claims of the papacy were pushed with vigor by Innocent I (402–417\r\nA. D.) and Leo I (440–461 A. D.). The latter laid particular stress upon\r\nthe primacy of Peter among the Apostles and taught that this had descended\r\nto his apostolic successors. It was Leo also who induced the western\r\nemperor Valentinian III in 455 to order the whole western church to obey\r\nthe bishop of Rome as the heir to the primacy of Peter. The Pope Gelasius\r\n(492–496 A. D.) asserted the power of the priests to be superior to the\r\nimperial authority, but the establishment of the Ostrogothic kingdom in\r\nItaly and the reconquest of the peninsula by the eastern emperor weakened\r\nthe independence of the Roman bishopric. Justinian was able to compel the\r\npopes to submit to his authority in religious matters.\r\n\r\n*The patriarchate of Constantinople.* A rival to the papacy developed in\r\nthe patriarchate of Constantinople, which at the Council of Constantinople\r\nin 381 was recognized as taking precedence over the other eastern\r\nbishoprics and ranking next to that of Rome, “because Constantinople is\r\nNew Rome.” However, the primacy of the bishop of Constantinople in the\r\neastern church was challenged by the older patriarchates of Ephesus,\r\nAntioch and Alexandria, all of which had been apostolic foundations, while\r\nthe claims of Constantinople to that honor were more than dubious. Between\r\n381 and 451 the bishops of Alexandria successfully disputed the doctrinal\r\nauthority of the see of Constantinople, but at the council of Chalcedon\r\n(451 A. D.) Pulcheria and Marcian reasserted the primacy of the patriarch\r\nof the capital. At this time also the bishopric of Jerusalem was\r\nrecognized as a patriarchate. The patriarch of Constantinople was now\r\nplaced on an equality with the pope, a recognition against which the Pope\r\nLeo protested in vain. However, the patriarchs of Constantinople never\r\nacquired the power and independence of the popes. Situated as they were in\r\nthe shadow of the imperial palace, and owing their ecclesiastical\r\nauthority to the support of the throne, they rarely ventured to oppose the\r\nwill of the emperor. Under Justinian the patriarch held the position of a\r\n“minister of state in the department of religion.”\r\n\r\n*The temporal power of the clergy.* When Christianity became a religion of\r\nstate it was inevitable that the Christian clergy should occupy a\r\nprivileged position. This recognition was accorded them by Constantine the\r\nGreat when he exempted them from personal services (_munera_) in 313 and\r\ntaxation in 319 A. D. Those who entered the ranks of the clergy were\r\nexpected to abandon all worldly pursuits, and an imperial edict of 452\r\nexcluded them from all gainful occupations. In addition to their\r\necclesiastical authority in matters of belief and church discipline, the\r\nbishops also acquired considerable power in secular affairs. In the days\r\nof persecution the Christians had regularly submitted legal differences\r\namong themselves to the arbitration of their bishops, rather than resort\r\nto the tribunals of state. Constantine the Great gave legal sanction to\r\nthis episcopal arbitration in civil cases; Arcadius, however, restricted\r\nits use to cases in which the litigants voluntarily submitted to the\r\nbishop’s judgment. The bishops enjoyed no direct criminal jurisdiction,\r\nalthough since the right of sanctuary was accorded to the churches, they\r\nwere frequently able to intercede with effect for those who sought asylum\r\nwith them. In the enforcement of moral and humanitarian legislation the\r\nstate called for the coöperation of the bishops.\r\n\r\nThe influential position of the bishops as the religious heads of the\r\nmunicipalities led to their being accorded a definite place in the\r\nmunicipal administration. In protecting the impoverished taxpayers against\r\nthe imperial officers they were more effective than the “_defensores\r\nplebis_.” And in the days of the barbarian invasions, when the\r\nrepresentatives of the imperial authority were driven from the provinces,\r\nthe bishops became the leaders of the Roman population in their contact\r\nwith the barbarian conquerors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          III. SECTARIAN STRIFE\r\n\r\n\r\n*Sectarianism.* The history of the church from Constantine to Justinian is\r\nlargely the history of sectarian strife, which had its origin in doctrinal\r\ncontroversies. While the western church in general abstained from acute\r\ntheological discussions and adhered strictly to the orthodox or\r\nestablished creed, devoting its energies to the development of church\r\norganization, the church of the East, imbued with the Greek philosophic\r\nspirit, busied itself with attempts to solve the mysteries of the\r\nChristian faith and was a fruitful source of heterodoxy. Strife between\r\nthe adherents of the various sects was waged with extreme bitterness and\r\nfrequently culminated in riots and bloodshed. Toleration was unknown and\r\nheretics, like pagans, were classed as criminals and excluded from\r\ncommunion with the orthodox church. Of the many sects which arose in the\r\nfourth and fifth centuries, two were of outstanding importance. These were\r\nthe Arians and the monophysites.\r\n\r\n*Arianism.* Arianism had its rise in an attempt to express with\r\nphilosophical precision the relation of the three members of the Holy\r\nTrinity; God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. About 318 A. D., Arius,\r\na presbyter of Alexandria, taught that God was from eternity but that the\r\nSon and the Spirit were his creations. Over the teaching of Arius, a\r\ncontroversy arose which threatened the unity of the church. Accordingly,\r\nConstantine intervened and summoned the ecumenical council of Nicaea to\r\ndecide upon the orthodoxy of Arius. The council accepted the formula of\r\nAthanasius that the Son was of the same substance (_homo-ousion_) as the\r\nFather, which was the doctrine of the West. Arius was exiled.\r\n\r\nThe struggle, however, was by no means over, for the Nicene creed found\r\nmany opponents among the eastern bishops who did not wish to exclude the\r\nArians from the church. The leader of this party was Eusebius of Caesarea.\r\nIn 335 they brought about the deposition of Athanasius, who had been\r\nbishop of Alexandria since 328. After the death of Constantine, Athanasius\r\nwas permitted to return to his see, only to be expelled again in 339 by\r\nConstantius, who was under the influence of Eusebius. He took refuge in\r\nthe West, where the Pope Julius gave him his support. At a general council\r\nof the church held at Serdica (Sofia) in 343 there was a sharp division\r\nbetween East and West, but the supporters of Athanasius were in the\r\nmajority, and he and the other orthodox eastern bishops were reinstated in\r\ntheir sees (345 A. D.).\r\n\r\nWhen Constantius became sole ruler of the empire (353 A. D.) the enemies\r\nof Athanasius once more gained the upper hand. The emperor forced a\r\ngeneral council convoked at Milan in 353 to condemn and depose Athanasius,\r\nwhile the Pope Liberius, who supported him, was exiled to Macedonia. A new\r\ncouncil held at Sirmium in 357 tried to secure religious peace by\r\nforbidding the use of the word “substance” in defining the relation of the\r\nFather and the Son, and sanctioned only the term _homoios_ (like). The\r\nadherents of this creed were called Homoeans. Although they were not\r\nArians, their solution was rejected by the conservatives in both East and\r\nWest. In 359 a double council was held, the western bishops meeting at\r\nAriminum, the eastern at Seleucia. The result was the acceptance of the\r\nSirmian creed, although the western council had to be almost starved\r\nbefore it yielded. Under Julian and Jovian the Arians enjoyed full\r\ntoleration, and while Valentinian I pursued a similar policy, Valens went\r\nfurther and gave Arianism his support.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, however, the labors of the three great\r\nCappadocians,—Basil of Caesarea, Gregory of Nazianzus and Gregory of\r\nNyssa—had already done much to reconcile the eastern bishops to the\r\nNicaean confession and, with the accession of Theodosius I, the fate of\r\nArianism was sealed. A council of the eastern church met at Constantinople\r\nin 381 and accepted the Nicene creed. The Arian bishops were deposed and\r\nassemblies of the heretics forbidden by imperial edicts. Among the\r\nsubjects of the empire Arianism rapidly died out, although it existed for\r\na century and a half as the faith of several Germanic peoples.\r\n\r\n*The monophysite controversy.* While the point at issue in the dogmatic\r\ncontroversies of the fourth century was the relation of God to the Son and\r\nthe Holy Spirit, the burning question of the fifth and sixth centuries was\r\nthe nature of Christ. And, like the former, the latter dispute arose in\r\nthe East, having its origin in the divergent views of the theological\r\nschools of Antioch and Alexandria. The former laid stress upon the two\r\nnatures in Christ—the divine and the human; the latter emphasized his\r\ndivinity to the exclusion of his humanity, and hence its adherents\r\nreceived the name of monophysites. The Antiochene position was the\r\northodox or traditional view of the church, and was held universally in\r\nthe West, where the duality of Christ was accepted without any attempt to\r\ndetermine the relationship of his divine and human qualities. Beneath the\r\ndoctrinal controversy lay the rivalry between the patriarchates of\r\nAlexandria and Constantinople, and the awakening national antagonism of\r\nthe native Egyptian and Syrian peoples towards the Greeks. The conflict\r\nbegan in 429 with an attack of Cyril, patriarch of Alexandria, upon the\r\nteachings of Nestorius, the patriarch of Constantinople. Cyril, taking the\r\nview that the nature of Christ was human made fully divine, justified the\r\nuse of the word _Theotokos_ (Mother of God), which was coming to be\r\napplied generally to the Virgin Mary. Nestorius criticized its use, and\r\nargued in favor of the term Mother of Christ. In the controversy which\r\nensued, Cyril won the support of the bishop of Rome, who desired to weaken\r\nthe authority of the see of Constantinople, and Nestorius was condemned at\r\nthe council of Ephesus in 431.\r\n\r\nThe next phase of the struggle opened in 448, when Dioscorus, the occupant\r\nof the Alexandrine see, assailed Flavian, the patriarch of the capital,\r\nfor having deposed Eutyches, a monophysite abbot of Constantinople. At the\r\nso-called “Robber Council” of Ephesus (449 A. D.) Dioscorus succeeded in\r\nhaving Flavian deprived of his see. But the pope, Leo I. pronounced in\r\nfavor of the doctrine of the duality of Christ, and in 451 the new emperor\r\nMarcian called an ecumenical council at Chalcedon which definitely\r\nreasserted the primacy of the see of Constantinople in the East, approved\r\nthe use of _Theotokos_, and declared that Christ is of two natures. The\r\nattempt to enforce the decisions of this council provoked disturbances in\r\nEgypt, Palestine and the more easterly countries. In Palestine it required\r\nthe use of armed force to suppress a usurping monophysite bishop. In Egypt\r\nthe enforcement led to a split between the orthodox Greek and the\r\nmonophysite Coptic churches.\r\n\r\nAs the opposition to the decree of Chalcedon still disturbed the peace of\r\nthe church, the emperor Zeno in 482, at the instigation of the patriarchs\r\nAcacius of Constantinople and Peter of Alexandria, sought to settle the\r\ndispute by exercise of the imperial authority. He issued a letter to the\r\nchurch of Egypt called the _Henoticon_, which, while acknowledging the\r\ncouncils of Nicaea and Constantinople, condemned that of Chalcedon, and\r\ndeclared that “Christ is one and not two.” This doctrine was at once\r\ncondemned by the Pope Silvanus. The rupture with Rome lasted until 519,\r\nwhen a reconciliation was effected at the price of complete submission by\r\nthe East and the rehabilitation of the council of Chalcedon. This in turn\r\nantagonized the monophysites of Syria and Egypt and caused Justinian to\r\nembark upon his hopeless task of reëstablishing complete religious unity\r\nwithin the empire by holding the western and winning back the eastern\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\nJustinian hoped to reconcile the monophysites by an interpretation of the\r\ndiscussions of the council of Chalcedon which would be acceptable to them.\r\nThis led him, in 544, to condemn the so-called Three Chapters, which were\r\nthe doctrines of the opponents of the monophysites. And although this step\r\nimplied a condemnation of the council of Chalcedon itself, and was\r\nconsequently opposed in the West, he forced the fifth ecumenical council\r\nof Constantinople in 553 to sanction it. However, neither this concession\r\nnor the still greater one of the edict of 565 availed to win back the\r\nextreme monophysites of Egypt and Syria, where opposition to the religious\r\njurisdiction of Constantinople had taken a national form, and the\r\nreligious disunion in the East continued until these lands were lost to\r\nthe empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             IV. MONASTICISM\r\n\r\n\r\n*The origin of monasticism.* Monasticism (from the Greek _monos_,\r\n“single”), which became so marked a feature of the religious life of the\r\nMiddle Ages, had its origin in the ascetic tendencies of the early\r\nChristian church, which harmonized with the eastern religious and\r\nphilosophic ideal of a life of pure contemplation. The chief\r\ncharacteristics of early Christian asceticism were celibacy, fasting,\r\nprayer, surrender of worldly goods, and the adoption of a hermit’s life.\r\nThis renouncement of a worldly life was practised by large numbers of both\r\nmen and women, especially in Egypt. It was there that organized monastic\r\nlife began early in the fourth century under the influence of St. Anthony\r\nin northern and Pachomius in southern Egypt.\r\n\r\n*Anthony and Pachomius in Egypt.* Anthony was the founder of a monastic\r\ncolony, which was a direct development from the eremitical life. He laid\r\ndown no rule for the guidance of the lives of the monks, but permitted the\r\nmaximum of individual freedom. It was Pachomius who first established a\r\ntruly cenobitical monastery, in which the monks lived a common life under\r\nthe direction of a single head, the abbot, according to a prescribed rule\r\nwith fixed religious exercises and daily labor. The organization of\r\nconvents for women accompanied the foundation of the monasteries. However,\r\nthe Antonian type of monkhood continued to be the more popular in Egypt,\r\nwhere monasticism flourished throughout the fourth, but began to decline\r\nin the fifth, century.\r\n\r\n*Eastern monasticism.* From Egypt the movement spread to Palestine, but in\r\nSyria and Mesopotamia there was an independent development from the local\r\neremitical ideals. Characteristic of Syrian asceticism were the pillar\r\nhermits who passed their lives upon the top of lofty pillars. The founder\r\nof the Greek monasticism was Basil (c. 360 A. D.), who copied Pachomius in\r\norganizing a fully cenobitical life. He discouraged excessive asceticism\r\nand emphasized the value of useful toil. The eastern monks were noted for\r\ntheir fanaticism and they took a very prominent part in the religious\r\ndisorders of the time. The abuses of the early, unregulated monastic life\r\nled to the formulation of monastic rules and the subjection of the monks\r\nto the authority of the bishops.\r\n\r\n*Monasticism in the west: Benedict.* Monasticism was introduced in the\r\nWest by Athanasius, who came from Egypt to Rome in 339. From Italy it\r\nspread to the rest of western Europe. The great organizer of western\r\nmonasticism was Benedict, who lived in the early sixth century, and\r\nfounded the monastery at Monte Cassino about 520 A. D. His monastic rule\r\ndefinitely abandoned the eremitical ideal in favor of the cenobitical. In\r\naddition to worship and work, the Benedictine rule made reading a monastic\r\nduty. This stimulated the collection of libraries in the monasteries and\r\nmade the monks the guardians of literary culture throughout the Middle\r\nAges.\r\n\r\nAs yet no distinct monastic orders had developed, but each monastery was\r\nautonomous under the direction of its own abbot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          V. LITERATURE AND ART\r\n\r\n\r\n*General characteristics.* The period between the accession of Diocletian\r\nand the death of Justinian saw the gradual disappearance of the ancient\r\nGraeco-Roman culture. In spite of Diocletian’s reëstablishment of the\r\nempire, there was a steady lowering of the general cultural level. This\r\nwas due chiefly to the progressive barbarization of the empire and to the\r\ndecline of paganism which lay at the roots of ancient civilization. The\r\none creative force of the time was Christianity, but, save in the fields\r\nof religion and ethics, it did little to stem the ebbing tide of old world\r\nculture.\r\n\r\n*Literature.* The dying out of this culture is clearly to be seen in the\r\nhistory of the Greek and Roman literatures of the period, each of which\r\nshows the same general traits. In the fourth century, under the impulse of\r\nthe restoration of Diocletian, there is a brief revival of productivity in\r\npagan literature. But this is characterized by archaism and lack of\r\ncreative power. The imitation of the past produces not only an\r\nartificiality of style, but also of language, so that literature loses\r\ntouch with contemporary life and the language of the literary world is\r\nthat of previous centuries, no longer that of the people. Rhetorical\r\nstudies are the sole form of higher education, and are in part responsible\r\nfor the archaism and artificiality of contemporary literature, owing to\r\nthe emphasis which they laid upon literary form to the neglect of\r\nsubstance. In the fifth century, following the complete triumph of\r\nChristianity, pagan literature comes to an end.\r\n\r\nThe recognition of Christianity as an imperial religion by Constantine,\r\nits subsequent victorious assault upon paganism, and the intensity of\r\nsectarian strife gave to Christian literature a freshness and vigor\r\nlacking in the works of pagan writers, and produced a wealth of\r\napologetic, dogmatic and theological writings. But the Christian authors\r\nfollowed the accepted categories of the pagan literature, and while\r\nproducing polemic writings, works of translation and of religious\r\nexegesis, they entered the fields of history, biography, oratory and\r\nepistolography. Thus arose a profane, as well as a sacred, Christian\r\nliterature. And since Christian writers were themselves men of education\r\nand appealed to educated circles, their works are dominated by the current\r\nrhetorical standards of literary taste. Yet in some aspects, in particular\r\nin sacred poetry and popular religious biography, they break away from\r\nclassical traditions and develop new literary types.\r\n\r\nBut after the first half of the fifth century originality and productivity\r\nin Christian literature also are on the wane. This is in part due to the\r\neffects of the struggle of the empire with barbarian peoples; in part to\r\nthe suppression of freedom of religious thought by the orthodox church.\r\nEven after the extinction of paganism the classical literatures of Greece\r\nand Rome afforded the only material for a non-religious education. And\r\nsince they no longer constituted a menace to Christianity, the church\r\nbecame reconciled to their use for purposes of instruction, and it was to\r\nthe church, and especially to the monasteries, that the pagan literature\r\nowes its preservation throughout the Dark Ages.\r\n\r\nA symptom of the general intellectual decline of the later empire is the\r\ndying out of Greek in the western empire. While up to the middle of the\r\nthird Christian century the world of letters had been bi-lingual, from\r\nthat time onwards, largely as a result of the political conditions which\r\nled to a separation of the eastern and western parts of the empire, the\r\nknowledge of Greek began to disappear in the West until in the late empire\r\nit was the exception for a Latin-speaking man of letters to be versed in\r\nthe Greek tongue.\r\n\r\n*Pagan Latin literature.* A wide gulf separated the pagan Latin literature\r\nof the fourth century from that of the early principate. Poetry had\r\ndegenerated to learned tricks, historical writing had taken the form of\r\nepitomies, while published speeches and letters were but empty exhibitions\r\nof rhetorical skill. The influence of rhetorical studies made itself felt\r\nin legal phraseology, which now lost its former clarity, directness and\r\nsimplicity. Still there are a few outstanding literary figures who deserve\r\nmention because they are so expressive of the tendencies of the time or\r\nbecause they have been able to attain a higher level.\r\n\r\n*Ausonius and Symmachus (c. 345–405 A. D.).* The career of Ausonius, a\r\nprofessor of grammar and rhetoric at Bordeaux, whose life covers the\r\nfourth century, shows how highly rhetorical instruction was valued. His\r\nability procured him imperial recognition, and he became the tutor of\r\nGratian, from whom he received the honor of the consulate in 379. His\r\npoetical works are chiefly clever verbal plays, but one, the _Mosella_,\r\nwhich describes a voyage down the river Moselle, is noteworthy for its\r\ndescription of contemporary life and its appreciation of the beauty of\r\nnature. Quintus Aurelius Symmachus, city prefect, and the leader of the\r\npagan party in Rome under Gratian and Valentinian II, is a typical\r\nrepresentative of the educated society of the time which strove to keep\r\nalive a knowledge of classical literature. He left a collection of\r\norations and letters, poor in thought, but rich in empty phrase.\r\n\r\n*Ammianus Marcellinus, fl. 350–400 A. D.* A man of far different stamp was\r\nAmmianus Marcellinus, by birth a Greek of Antioch, and an officer of high\r\nrank in the imperial army. Taking Tacitus as his model, he wrote in Latin\r\na history which continued the former’s work for the period from 96 to 378\r\nA. D. Of this only the part covering the years 353 to 378 has survived.\r\nHis history is characterized by sound judgment and objectivity, but is\r\nmarred by the introduction of frequent digressions extraneous to the\r\nsubject in hand and by a strained rhetorical style. However, it remains\r\nthe one considerable pagan work in Latin prose from the late empire.\r\n\r\n*Claudius Claudianus and Rutilius Namatianus (both fl. 400 A. D.).* The\r\n“last eminent man of letters who was a professed pagan” in the western\r\nempire was Claudius Claudianus. Claudian was by birth an Egyptian Greek\r\nwho took up his residence in Rome about 395 A. D. and attached himself to\r\nthe military dictator, Stilicho. He chose to write in Latin, and composed\r\nhexameter epics which celebrated the military exploits of his patron. He\r\nalso wrote mythological epics and elegiacs. Claudian found his inspiration\r\nin Ovid and reawakened the charm of Augustan poetry. A contemporary of\r\nClaudian, and, like him a pagan, was Rutilius Namatianus, who was a native\r\nof southern Gaul but a resident of Rome where he attained the highest\r\nsenatorial offices. His literary fame rests upon the elegiac poem in which\r\nhe described his journey from Rome to Gaul in 416 A. D., and revealed the\r\nhold which the imperial city still continued to exercise upon men’s minds.\r\n\r\n*Christian Latin literature: Lactantius (d. about 325 A. D.).* It is among\r\nthe writers of Christian literature that the few great Latin authors of\r\nthe time are to be found. At the beginning of the fourth century stood\r\nLactantius, an African, who became a teacher of rhetoric in Nicomedia,\r\nwhere he was converted to Christianity. His chief work was the _Divinae\r\nInstitutiones_, an introduction to Christian doctrine, which was an\r\nattempt to create a philosophical Christianity. His purity of style has\r\ncaused him to be called the “Christian Cicero.”\r\n\r\n*Ambrose, (d. 397 A. D.).* Ambrose, the powerful bishop of Milan, who\r\nexercised such great influence with Gratian and Theodosius the Great, also\r\ndisplayed great literary activity. In general, his writings are\r\ndevelopments of his sermons, and display no very great learning. Their\r\npower depended upon the strength of his personality. More important from a\r\nliterary standpoint are the hymns which he composed for use in church\r\nservices to combat in popular form the Arian doctrines. In his verses\r\nAmbrose adhered to the classic metrical forms, but in the course of the\r\nnext two centuries these were abandoned for the use of the rhymed verse,\r\nwhich itself was a development of the current rhetorical prose.\r\n\r\n*Jerome, 335–420 A. D.* The most learned of the Latin Christian writers of\r\nantiquity was Jerome (Hieronymus), a native of northern Bosnia, whose\r\nretired, studious life was in striking contrast to the public, official\r\ncareer of Ambrose. A Greek and Hebrew scholar, in addition to his dogmatic\r\nwritings he made a Latin translation of the Old Testament from the Hebrew\r\n(the basis of the later _Vulgate_), and another of the Greek _Church\r\nHistory_ of Eusebius.\r\n\r\n*Augustine, 354–430 A. D.* The long line of notable literary figures of\r\nthe African church is closed by Augustine, the bishop of Hippo who died\r\nduring the siege of his city by the Vandals in 430 A. D. In his early life\r\na pagan, he found inspiration and guidance in the philosophy of Plato and\r\nAristotle. But while Jerome was still dominated by Greek religious\r\nthought, Augustine was the first Latin Christian writer to emancipate\r\nhimself from this dependence and display originality of form and ideas in\r\nhis works. Of these the two most significant are the _Confessions_ and _On\r\nthe City of God_. The _Confessions_ reveal the story of his inner life,\r\nthe struggle of good and evil in his own soul. The work _On the City of\r\nGod_ was inspired by the sack of Rome by Alaric in 410 and the accusation\r\nof the pagans that this was a punishment for the abandonment of the\r\nancient deities. In answer to this charge Augustine develops a\r\nphilosophical interpretation of history as the conflict of good and evil\r\nforces, in which the Heavenly City is destined to triumph over that of\r\nthis world. His work prepared the way for the conception of the Roman\r\nCatholic Church as the city of God.\r\n\r\n*Boethius (d. 524 A. D.) and Cassiodorus (c. 480–575 A. D.).* Between the\r\ndeath of Augustine and the death of Justinian the West produced no\r\necclesiastical literary figure worthy of note. However, under the\r\nOstrogothic régime in Italy, profane literature is represented by two\r\noutstanding personalities—Boethius and Cassiodorus. The patrician Boethius\r\nwhile in prison awaiting his death sentence from Theoderic composed his\r\nwork _On the Consolation of Philosophy_, a treatise embued with the finest\r\nspirit of Greek intellectual life. Cassiodorus, who held the posts of\r\nquaestor and master of the offices under Theoderic, has left valuable\r\nhistorical material in his _Variae_, a collection of official letters\r\ndrawn up by him in the course of his administrative duties. His chief\r\nliterary work was a history of the Goths, of which unfortunately only a\r\nfew excerpts have remained. In his later years Cassiodorus retired to a\r\nmonastery which he founded and organized according to the Benedictine\r\nrule. There he performed an inestimable service in fostering the\r\npreservation of secular as well as ecclesiastical knowledge among the\r\nbrethren, thus giving to the Benedictine monks the impulse to intellectual\r\nwork for which they were so distinguished in medieval times.\r\n\r\n*Greek Christian literature; Religious prose.* It was in the fourth\r\ncentury that Greek Christian prose literature reached its height. Among\r\nits leading representatives were Athanasius, the bishop of Alexandria who\r\nfought the Arian heresy; Eusebius, bishop of Caesarea, the founder of\r\nchurch history; Gregory of Nazianzus, church orator and poet; and Basil,\r\nbishop of Caesarea in Cappadocia, the organizer of Greek monasticism.\r\nAbove them all in personality and literary ability stood John Chrysostom\r\n(the Golden-mouth), patriarch of Constantinople under Arcadius. With the\r\nfifth century came a decline in theological prose; men resorted to\r\nexcerpts and collections. But at this time began the development of the\r\npopular monastic narratives and lives of the saints which served as the\r\nnovels and romances of the time.\r\n\r\n*Religious poetry.* It was subsequent to the fourth century also that\r\nChristian religious poetry attained its bloom. Here a break was made with\r\nclassical tradition in the adoption of accentual in place of quantitative\r\nverse. This was in harmony with the disappearance of distinctions of\r\nsyllabic quantity from popular speech. The use of rhythm in verse was\r\nintroduced by Gregory of Nazianzus, but the chief and most productive\r\nrepresentative of the new poetry was Romanus, a converted Syrian Jew whose\r\nactivity falls in the reign of Justinian.\r\n\r\n*Greek profane literature.* Contemporary profane Greek literature exhibits\r\nless originality and interest. Historical writing was continued in strict\r\nimitation of classical models by both Christian and pagan writers. Of\r\nexceptional historical value are the works of Procopius, the historian of\r\nthe wars of Justinian, who like Ammianus Marcellinus shared in an official\r\ncapacity in the events which he described. A more popular form of\r\nhistorical writing was the compilation of chronicles of world history,\r\ncollections of excerpts put together for the most part by men who failed\r\nto understand their sources. The profane verse of the time is represented\r\nby narrative poems, such as the _Dionysiaca_ and the metrical version of\r\nthe Gospel of St. John composed by Nonnus in Egypt (c. 400 A. D.), and by\r\na rich epigrammatic literature.\r\n\r\nIn the eastern empire literary productivity continued, although on the\r\ndecline, slightly longer than in the West, but by the middle of the sixth\r\ncentury there also it had come to an end.\r\n\r\n*Art.* The art of the late empire exhibits the same general\r\ncharacteristics as the literature. Not only was there a general lack of\r\noriginality and creative capacity, but even the power of imitating the\r\nmasterpieces of earlier times was conspicuously lacking. The Arch of\r\nConstantine erected in 312 A. D. affords a good illustration of the\r\nsituation. Its decoration mainly consists of sculptures appropriated from\r\nmonuments of the first and second century, beside which the new work is\r\ncrude and unskilful. A comparison of the imperial portraits on the coins\r\nof the fourth century with those of the principate up to the dynasty of\r\nthe Severi reveals the same decline in taste and artistic ability.\r\n\r\nIn the realm of art as in literature Christianity supplied a new creative\r\nimpulse, which made itself felt in the adaptation of pagan artistic forms\r\nto Christian purposes. The earliest traces of Christian art are to be\r\nfound in the mural paintings of the underground burial vaults and chapels\r\nof the Roman catacombs, and in the sculptured reliefs which adorned the\r\nsarcophagi of the wealthy. These were popular branches of contemporary art\r\nand the influence of Christianity consisted in the artistic representation\r\nof biblical subjects and the employment of Christian symbolical motives.\r\nThese forms of Christian art decayed with the general cultural decline\r\nthat followed the third century.\r\n\r\nThe most important and original contribution of Christianity to the art of\r\nthe late empire was in the development of church architecture. To meet the\r\nneeds of the Christian church service, which included the opportunity to\r\naddress large audiences, there arose the Christian basilica, which took\r\nits name from the earlier profane structures erected to serve as places\r\nfor the conduct of public business, but which differed considerably from\r\nthem in its construction. In general the basilica was a long rectangular\r\nbuilding, divided by rows of columns into a central hall or nave and two\r\nside halls or aisles. The walls of the nave rose above the roof of the\r\naisles, and allowed space for windows. The roof was flat or gabled, and,\r\nlike the wall spaces, covered with paintings or mosaics. The rear of the\r\nstructure was a semicircular apse which held the seats of the bishop and\r\nthe lower clergy. To the original plan there came to be added the\r\ntransept, a hall at right angles to the main structure between it and the\r\napse. This gave the basilica its later customary crosslike form.\r\n\r\nWhile the basilica became the almost universal form of church architecture\r\nin Italy and the West, in the East preference was shown for round or\r\npolygonal structures with a central dome, an outgrowth of the Roman\r\nrotunda, which was first put to Christian uses in tombs and grave chapels.\r\nA rich variety of types, combining the central dome with other\r\narchitectural features arose in the cities of Asia and Egypt. The\r\nmasterpiece of this style was the church of St. Sophia erected by\r\nJustinian in Constantinople in 537 A. D. Another notable example from the\r\nsame period is the church of San Vitale at Ravenna.\r\n\r\nIn the mosaics which adorn these and other structures of the time are to\r\nbe seen the traces of a Christian Hellenistic school of painting which\r\ngave pictorial expression to the whole biblical narrative. These mosaics\r\nand the miniature paintings employed in the illuminated manuscripts\r\nsurvived as prominent features of Byzantine art.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 EPILOGUE\r\n\r\n\r\n*The Lombard and Slavic invasions.* In 568 A. D., three years after the\r\ndeath of Justinian, the Lombards descended upon Italy from Pannonia and\r\nwrested from the empire the Po valley and part of central Italy. The\r\nRomans were confined to Ravenna, Rome, and the southern part of the\r\npeninsula. Towards the close of the sixth century (after 581 A. D.)\r\noccurred the migrations of the Bulgars and Slavs across the Danube which\r\nresulted in the Slavic occupation of Illyricum and the interposition of a\r\nbarbarous, heathen people between the eastern empire and western Europe.\r\nEarly in the seventh century the Roman possessions in Spain were lost to\r\nthe Goths.\r\n\r\n*The papacy and the Holy Roman Empire.* The weakness of the imperial\r\nauthority in the West led to the strengthening of the papacy and its\r\nacquisition of political power in Italy. It was the papacy also which kept\r\nalive in western Europe the ideal of a universal imperial church, for the\r\nwhole of western Christendom came to acknowledge the supremacy of the\r\nRoman see. Nor was the conception of a reëstablished western empire lost\r\nto view; and it was destined to find realization in the Holy Roman empire\r\nof Charlemagne and his successors. Of great importance for the future\r\ndevelopment of European civilization was the fact that the western part of\r\nthe Roman empire had passed under the control of peoples either already\r\nChristianized or soon to become so, and that the church, chiefly through\r\nthe monasteries, was thus enabled to become the guardian of the remnants\r\nof ancient culture.\r\n\r\n*The Byzantine empire.* The loss of the western provinces and Illyricum\r\ntransferred the center of gravity in the empire from the Latin to the\r\nGreek element and accelerated the transformation of the eastern Roman\r\nempire into an essentially Greek state—the Byzantine empire. The Byzantine\r\nempire inherited from the Roman its organization and the name _Romaioi_\r\n(Romans) for its citizens, but before the close of the sixth century Greek\r\nhad supplanted Latin as the language of government. This transformation\r\nfurther accentuated the religious differences between East and West, which\r\nled ultimately to the separation of the Greek and Roman Catholic Churches.\r\n\r\n*The Mohammedan invasion.* Before the middle of the seventh century Egypt\r\nand Syria were occupied by the Saracens, whose conquest was facilitated by\r\nthe animosity of the monophysite native populations towards the rule of an\r\northodox emperor. However, the loss of these territories gave fresh\r\nsolidarity to the empire in the East by restricting its authority to the\r\nreligiously and linguistically homogeneous, and thoroughly loyal,\r\npopulation of Asia Minor and the eastern Balkan peninsula. This solidarity\r\nenabled the Byzantine empire to fulfill its historic mission of forming\r\nthe eastern bulwark of Christian Europe against the Turk throughout the\r\nMiddle Ages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHRONOLOGICAL TABLE\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.

Roman citizens—\r\n                  (a) with full civic rights (_optimo iure_).\r\n                  (b) with private rights only (_sine suffragio_).\r\n            II. Roman allies—\r\n                  (a) Latins.\r\n                  (b) Federate peoples of Italy.\r\n\r\n    2 Another, but apparently later, Roman tradition placed the\r\n      establishment of the tribunate in 494, when two tribunes were\r\n      elected, and merely attributes an increase in their number to 466.\r\n\r\n    3 One explanation of the origin of this tribunate offered in antiquity\r\n      and still held in some quarters is that it was created to take the\r\n      place of the consulship as an office to which plebeians might be\r\n      admitted while they were still excluded from the regular presidency.\r\n      Against this view, besides the existence of another explanation\r\n      equally old which has been adopted above, it may be urged that\r\n      although the military tribunate first appeared in 436 B. C. it was\r\n      not until 40 years later that plebeians were elected to it. And\r\n      further, plebeians only appear in six of the fifty-one colleges of\r\n      military tribunes elected between 436 and 362.\r\n\r\n    4 To the Romans the Carthaginians were known as _Poeni_, _i. e._,\r\n      Phoenicians, whence comes the adjective “Punic,” used in such\r\n      phrases as the “Punic Wars.”\r\n\r\n    5 This alliance was renewed in 248 B. C.\r\n\r\n    6 See W. W. Tarn, “The Fleets of the First Punic War,” _Journal of\r\n      Hellenic Studies_, 1907, p. 51, n. 19.\r\n\r\n    7 Authorities differ as to the pass which Hannibal used in crossing\r\n      the Alps, arguing variously for the Little St. Bernard, Mont Genèvre\r\n      or Mont Cenis. Polybius, our best authority, seems to indicate the\r\n      Little St. Bernard. A recent discussion of the problem is Spencer\r\n      Wilkinson’s _Hannibal’s March across the Alps_, London, 1917.\r\n\r\n    8 See Kromeyer und Veith, _Antike Schlachtfelder_, iii. 2.\r\n\r\n    9 The details of this re-organization are uncertain. From our sources\r\n      it is clear that each of the first two classes had 70 centuries, one\r\n      of seniors and one of juniors from each of the 35 tribes. But we are\r\n      left in the dark with regard to the other classes. Botsford, in his\r\n      _Roman Assemblies_, would assign 70 centuries to each class; making\r\n      a total of 350, plus the 18 equestrian and 5 supernumerary\r\n      centuries, in all 373. Cavaignac, _Histoire dé l’Antiquité_, vol.\r\n      III, gives 10 centuries to each of the three lower classes, thus\r\n      keeping the old number of 193 centuries in all.\r\n\r\n   10 Seymour, P. A., _English Historical Review_, 1914, pp. 417 ff.\r\n\r\n   11 The details of this arrangement have not been preserved; for a\r\n      suggestion see Heitland, _Roman Republic_, II, pp. 447 ff.\r\n\r\n   12 On the much disputed date of the end of Caesar’s second term, see\r\n      Hardy, E. G., _Journal of Philology_, 1918, pp. 161 ff.\r\n\r\n   13 After the adoption his full name was Caius Julius Caesar Octavianus.\r\n      Although he was known as Caesar by his contemporaries, it is more\r\n      convenient to refer to him henceforth as Octavian, to distinguish\r\n      him from his adoptive father.\r\n\r\n_   14 Laudandum adulescentem, ornandum, tolendum_, Cicero, _Fam._, xi,\r\n      20, 1.\r\n\r\n   15 In this I follow Dio. xlix, 15, 6; li, 19, 6 and liii, 32, 5 and 6.\r\n\r\n_   16 Provinces of the Roman Empire_, I, 5, trans.
