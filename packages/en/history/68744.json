Published January, 1908\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe scope of my History of the Spanish Inquisition precluded a detailed\r\ninvestigation into the careers of individual tribunals. Such an\r\ninvestigation, however, is not without interest, especially with respect\r\nto the outlying ones, which were subjected to varying influences and\r\nreacted in varying ways on the peoples among whom they were established.\r\nMoreover, in some cases, this affords us an inside view of inquisitorial\r\nlife, of the characters of those to whom were confided the awful\r\nirresponsible powers of the Holy Office and of the abuse of those powers\r\nby officials whom distance removed from the immediate supervision of the\r\ncentral authority, suggesting a capacity for evil even greater than that\r\nmanifested in the Peninsula.\r\n\r\nThis is especially the case with the tribunals of the American Colonies,\r\nof which, thanks to the unwearied researches of Don José Toribio Medina,\r\nof Santiago de Chile, a fairly complete and minute account can be given,\r\nbased on the confidential correspondence of the local officials with the\r\nSupreme Council and the reports of the _visitadores_ or inspectors, who\r\nwere occasionally sent in the vain expectation of reducing them to\r\norder. While thus in the colonial tribunals we see the Inquisition at\r\nits worst, as a portion of the governmental system, we can realize how\r\npotent was its influence in contributing to the failure of Spanish\r\ncolonial policy, by preventing orderly and settled administration and by\r\nexciting disaffection which the Council of Indies more than once warned\r\nthe crown would lead to the loss of its transatlantic empire. It is\r\nperhaps not too much to say that these revelations moreover go far to\r\nexplain the influences which so long retarded the political and\r\nindustrial development of the emancipated colonies, for it was an evil\r\ninheritance weighing heavily on successive generations.\r\n\r\nI have not attempted to include the fateful career of the Inquisition in\r\nthe Netherlands, for this cannot be written until the completion of\r\nProfessor Paul Fredericq’s monumental “Corpus Documentorum Inquisitionis\r\nhæreticæ pravitatis Neerlandicæ,” the earlier volumes of which have\r\nthrown so much light on the repression of heresy in the Low Countries up\r\nto the dawn of the Reformation.\r\n\r\nIt is scarce necessary for me to make special acknowledgement to Señor\r\nMedina in all that relates to the American tribunals, for this is\r\nsufficiently attested by the constant reference to his works. With\r\nregard to Mexico I am under particular obligation to David Fergusson\r\nEsq. for the use of collections made by him during long residence in\r\nthat Republic and also to the late General Don Vicente Riva Palacio for\r\nthe communication of a number of interesting documents. To the late\r\nDoctor Paz Soldan of Lima my thanks are also due for copies made in the\r\narchives of Peru prior to their dispersion in 1881.\r\n\r\n     PHILADELPHIA, OCTOBER,

I.\r\n\r\nSICILY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe island of Sicily, in the fifteenth century, was a portion of the\r\ndominions of Aragon. Like the rest of the possessions of that crown, it\r\nhad enjoyed the benefits of the old papal Inquisition under the conduct\r\nof the Dominicans, but, as elsewhere, towards the close of the Middle\r\nAges, the institution had become nearly dormant, and at most was\r\nemployed occasionally to wring money from the Jews. An effort to\r\ngalvanize it, however, was made, in 1451, by the Inquisitor Fra Enrico\r\nLugardi, who produced a fictitious decree, purporting to have been\r\nissued in 1224, by the Emperor Frederic II, granting to the inquisitors\r\na third of the confiscations, together with yearly contributions from\r\nJews and infidels; this was confirmed by King Alfonso of Naples, and\r\nagain, in 1477, by Ferdinand and Isabella.[1] When, in 1484, the Spanish\r\nInquisition was extended to Aragon, Ferdinand did not at first seek to\r\ncarry its blessings to his insular possessions. February 12, 1481, he\r\nhad appointed Filippo de’Barbari, one of his confessors, as inquisitor\r\nof Sicily, Malta, Gozo and Pantelaria, who apparently did nothing to\r\nfurther the cause of the faith, for Sixtus IV, in letters of February\r\n23, 1483, to Isabella, complained of the prevalence in the island of the\r\nsame heresies that pervaded Spain; to repress these he had issued sundry\r\nbulls, which had proved inoperative in consequence of the opposition of\r\nthe royal officials, to his no little grief. Seeing the zeal displayed\r\nin Spain, he prayed and exhorted that it should be extended to Sicily\r\nand that the necessary royal favor be exhibited to the measures which he\r\nhad taken and might take in the future.[2] There is no evidence that\r\nthis produced any effect, and the institution seems to have remained\r\ninert until, about 1487, Torquemada, as Inquisitor-general of Aragon,\r\nappointed Fray Antonio de la Peña as inquisitor who, on August 18th of\r\nthat year, celebrated the first auto de fe, in which Eulalia Tamarit,\r\napparently a refugee from Saragossa, was burnt. It seems that a\r\nDominican, named Giacomo Roda, had been exercising the functions under a\r\ncommission from the General of his Order, who subsequently instructed\r\nthe provincial, Giacomo Manso, to dismiss him. In 1488 la Peña left\r\nSicily, appointing Manso to act during his absence, when Roda reasserted\r\nhimself and it required a brief from Innocent VIII, February 7, 1489, to\r\nmake him desist. In fact, at this time there seems to have been some\r\nconfusion between the claims of the papal and Spanish Inquisitions, for\r\nwe hear of another Dominican inquisitor, Pietro Ranzano, Bishop of\r\nLucera, to whom the senate of Palermo, on January 19, 1488, took the\r\ncustomary oath of obedience.[3]\r\n\r\nIn Sicily, as in Spain, the objects of the principal labors of the Holy\r\nOffice were the converts from Judaism. The Jews were numerous and rich\r\nand, although popular hatred was perhaps not so active as in Spain, it\r\nwas sufficiently vigorous, in 1474, to bring about a massacre, under\r\nthe pretext that they were endeavoring to undermine the Catholic faith\r\nby argument. The viceroy, Lope Ximenes de Urrea, hanged six of the\r\nleaders of the movement, in the hope of suppressing it but, undeterred\r\nby this, the populace, in many places, sacked the Juderías and put the\r\ninmates to the sword; five hundred thus were slain in Noto, six hundred\r\nin Modica and, for several years, the Jews were in constant fear of\r\nmassacre, in spite of royal and vice-regal edicts.[4] The number of\r\nvictims in these troubles indicates how considerable was the Jewish\r\npopulation; indeed, in 1450, they petitioned that, in the assessment of\r\na donation to King Alfonso of 10,000 florins they might be reckoned as a\r\ntenth of the population, a favor which was refused and, when in 1491,\r\nthe Jews were banished from Provence, a large portion of them flocked to\r\nSicily, attracted by the favorable conditions which had long been\r\naccorded there to the race.[5]\r\n\r\nThe edict of expulsion from Spain, in 1492, was operative in Sicily,\r\nunder conditions even more repulsively cruel. It was published June\r\n18th, and the day of departure was fixed at September 18th, under pain\r\nof death and confiscation. At once all their valuables were seized, in a\r\nhouse to house investigation, and inventories were made of their other\r\npossessions. They were required, within the three months, not only to\r\ncollect what was due to them and to pay their debts, but also to\r\nindemnify the king for their special tributes by capitalizing the annual\r\naggregate, on a basis of four per cent. interest. On August 13th an\r\norder was issued to license each to take a suit of common clothes, a\r\nmattress, a pair of worn sheets, a coverlet, three _tari_ in money\r\n(equivalent to half a florin), and a few provisions for the journey.\r\nReduced to despair, the Jews of Palermo petitioned to be allowed to\r\nretain money enough to pay their passages; that the rich could leave\r\ntheir property on deposit, and that poor debtors might be discharged\r\nfrom prison a month in advance. This drew from the viceroy an edict\r\nallowing the rich to take twice as much as the poor, except in the\r\nmatter of clothes. Not only their mattresses were to be searched for\r\nmoney and jewels, but even the cavities of their bodies, for which\r\nexaminers of both sexes were appointed. A payment of fifty thousand\r\nflorins to the king procured a postponement of three months, until\r\nDecember 18th, and during the interval the composition for their\r\ntributes was agreed upon, at a hundred thousand more, on payment of\r\nwhich they were to be allowed to take what was left of their inventoried\r\ngoods, but all precious metals and jewels were required to be turned\r\ninto merchandise. There was delay in collecting these sums, causing a\r\nfurther postponement of departure until January 12, 1493.[6] As the\r\nobject of the measure was the salvation of souls, the alternative of\r\nconversion was offered, to which the Jews were urged by a proclamation\r\nof Torquemada and by promises from the bishops and the viceroy.\r\nFerdinand, however, was not disposed thus to forego the opportunity of\r\ndespoiling his Jewish subjects, and issued an order requiring them to\r\npurchase the privilege of baptism with the surrender of forty-five per\r\ncent. of their property, which must have brought him in a considerable\r\nsum for, in spite of it, the rigorous terms imposed upon the exiles\r\ndrove many into the Christian fold.[7]\r\n\r\nThese compulsory Christians, always suspected, and generally with\r\nreason, of secretly cherishing their ancient faith, furnished a larger\r\nand more lucrative field for inquisitorial operations, but there seems\r\nto have been no immediate haste to cultivate it, and there is no trace\r\nof increased inquisitorial activity during the remaining years of the\r\ncentury. In December, 1497, Micer Sancho Marin, inquisitor of Sardinia,\r\nwas ordered to transfer himself to Sicily; he was in no haste to obey\r\nand, on March 11, 1498, Ferdinand wrote to him angrily that he was doing\r\nno good where he was and was much wanted in his new post, wherefore he\r\nwas commanded summarily to go there and leave all the effects of the\r\nSardinian tribunal for his successor. Short as was his career in Sicily,\r\nhe managed to disorganize the Inquisition and to incur general\r\ndetestation. Before the year was out, Ferdinand ordered him home and, on\r\nJanuary 20, 1499, he sent for all the other officials to return. To get\r\nback, Marin borrowed three hundred ounces,[8] without making provision\r\nfor repayment; to settle this and other debts and to pay for the\r\nhomeward voyage of the officials, Ferdinand ordered his viceroy to give\r\nto the receiver of confiscations, who was practically the treasurer,\r\neight hundred ducats, with a significant order to see that the parties\r\nwere not maltreated, which indicates the feelings popularly entertained\r\nfor them. The eight hundred ducats apparently were not easily raised,\r\nfor correspondence continued during the rest of the year as to the\r\npayment of debts and salaries; Pedro de Urrea, the receiver, fell into\r\ndisgrace and Ferdinand, in August, sent the notary, Ximeno Mayoral, to\r\nmake copies of all the papers in the tribunal, in order to be able to\r\nstraighten out matters.[9] Apparently the officials had been intent\r\nsolely upon their own gains, allowing the affairs of the tribunal to\r\nfall into complete confusion, and had confined their operations to\r\nselling pardons and exemptions for, when the auditor examining Urrea’s\r\naccounts asked for certificates of all who were condemned or penanced\r\nduring his tenure of office, Ferdinand epigrammatically replied that, as\r\nthere were none condemned or penanced, no certificates were required. It\r\nis true that there is mention of a certain Iñigo de Medina as having\r\ndied in prison, but he had not been arrested as a heretic and his\r\nsequestrated property was ordered to be returned to his widow.[10]\r\n\r\nEvidently the Sicilian Inquisition thus far had been a failure and\r\nthorough reorganization was necessary. It was for this that Ferdinand\r\nhad recalled the officials and, after an interval of some months, he\r\nproceeded to replace them. A letter of July 27, 1500, to Montoro, Bishop\r\nof Cefalù, announced his appointment as inquisitor, together with that\r\nof the bearer, Doctor Giovanni Sgalambro as his colleague, with whom\r\nwere sent Diego de Obregon as receiver, and Martin de Vallejo as\r\nalguazil, the rest of the officials being left for his selection. At the\r\nsame time the viceroy was instructed to show them all favor, to lodge\r\nthem in some suitable building and to advance to Obregon 780 gold\r\nducats for salaries, the sum to be repaid out of the expected\r\nconfiscations.[11] The Sicilian tribunal, however, was doomed to be\r\nunlucky. Ferdinand speedily discovered that Sgalambro was utterly unfit\r\nfor the position and, on November 6th, we find him writing in hot haste\r\nto Inquisitor-general Deza that, after it had had so unfortunate a\r\nbeginning, Sgalambro’s incumbency would destroy it; he had sent to\r\nValencia to stop his departure, but too late, and now he instructs Deza\r\nto select some good jurist for the place, as soon as possible, and\r\nbefore some evil is wrought in Sicily.[12] This eagerness, however,\r\nspeedily subsided and Sgalambro was allowed to retain his office for a\r\nyear. On November 8th, Montoro and he issued an edict requiring the\r\nsurrender of all official papers by those formerly connected with the\r\ntribunal; also one prohibiting all Conversos, or baptized Jews, from\r\nleaving the island without special licence, under pain of\r\nexcommunication, confiscation and arbitrary penalties, and offering to\r\ninformers ten per cent. of the confiscations. In December, the viceroy\r\nand all public officials took the customary oath of obedience and the\r\ninquisitors issued an Edict of Grace, promising relief from death and\r\nconfiscation to all heretics who would, within fifteen days, come\r\nforward and confess fully as to themselves and their associates. This\r\nwas accompanied with an Edict of Faith, ordering all cognizant of heresy\r\nto denounce it within fifteen days, threatening those who omitted to do\r\nso with prosecution for fautorship of heresy and promising secrecy for\r\ninformers. This latter edict apparently brought in few denunciations,\r\nfor it was repeated on January 14, 1501, and, at the same time, was\r\npublished a decree of the inquisitor-general, announcing the\r\ndisabilities of the descendants of those convicted of heresy. That these\r\nproceedings were as yet a novelty in Sicily is apparent from a monition\r\nissued by the inquisitors to the president of the states of the _Camera\r\nreginale_ not to impede in those districts the publication of the\r\nedicts.[13]\r\n\r\nEvidently the Inquisition was rapidly becoming organized for work, but\r\nit still lacked a fixed habitation for, on August 22d, Ferdinand wrote\r\nto his viceroy that a house was necessary for it and, as the one\r\noccupied by Mosen Johan Chilestro, the royal carver, was suitable, it\r\nwas to be taken for the purpose; he had no recollection that it had been\r\ngiven to the latter except for life but, if the heirs could prove a gift\r\nin perpetuity, they should be paid a suitable rent. Apparently the\r\nlabors of the tribunal were beginning to promise results in the\r\nlong-expected confiscations, for a letter of September 4th empowers the\r\nreceiver Obregon to compound a suit against Johan de San Martin, for\r\nproperty derived through his brother and father, for five thousand\r\nflorins and more if it could be obtained. It would seem, however, that\r\nas yet the status and privileges of the officials were not clearly\r\nrecognized in Sicily, for a letter of September 10th to the viceroy\r\nurges him to see that the inquisitors enjoy the immunities and\r\nexemptions conceded to them by the Holy See and that the officials are\r\nas well treated as in the rest of the Spanish dominions.[14]\r\n\r\nAt length a successor was found for Sgalambro in the person of Pedro de\r\nBelorado, an old Spanish inquisitor, now Archbishop-elect of Messina, to\r\nwhom Obregon was ordered, September 30th, to pay the same salary.[15]\r\nThe people had not even yet become accustomed to the arbitrary methods\r\nof the Holy Office, for the earliest act by which Belorado makes himself\r\nknown to us is his excommunication of the magistrates and judges of the\r\ntown of Catania as impeders of the Inquisition, because they had\r\nprevented the alguazil Martin de Vallejo from removing from their city\r\ncertain New Christians whom he had arrested. Vallejo had vindicated his\r\noffice by imposing on the spot a fine of a thousand ducats on the\r\noffenders, and this Belorado confirmed. In 1502 we find him issuing\r\nfresh Edicts of Grace and of Faith and, in 1503, Deza empowered him and\r\nMontoro to act either independently or conjointly.[16] It would seem\r\nthat the governor of the districts of the Camera reginale was still\r\nrecalcitrant, for a letter from Ferdinand, August 13, 1504, orders him\r\nto favor the operations of the tribunal, “for our officials have naught\r\nto do but what we ourself do, which is to obey the Holy Office.”[17]\r\n\r\nThere is not much evidence of activity at this period, but an auto de fe\r\nwas celebrated, August 11, 1506, in which was burnt Olivieri de Mauro,\r\na renegade Christian.[18] Probably this was followed by others, of which\r\nthe records have not reached us, but the troubles of the tribunal were\r\nnot yet over and, in 1509, it was practically suspended for awhile, for\r\nthe Bishop of Cefalù was transferred to Naples, as we shall see\r\nhereafter; Belorado died, the receiver Obregon was in Spain, and the\r\nother officials apparently dispersed, as there was no money to pay their\r\nsalaries. At length a successor was found in Doctor Alonso Bernal, whose\r\nappointment Ferdinand announced to the viceroy, January 19, 1510, but he\r\nwas in no haste to assume the duties for, on April 2d Ferdinand was\r\nobliged to furnish him with sixty ducats to expedite his departure from\r\nValencia. Obregon accompanied him and, as the whole staff of the\r\ntribunal had disappeared, he was empowered to fill their places and\r\nregulate their salaries, which were to be paid out of three hundred\r\nducats to be advanced by the royal treasurer and to be repaid out of the\r\nfirst proceeds of the expected confiscations.[19] The need of money was\r\ndoubtless an incentive to active work. Bernal lost no time in getting\r\nthe tribunal into shape and, by August 27th, we hear of his having many\r\nprisoners, for whose safe-keeping he had spent fifty ducats in arranging\r\na gaol.[20] The result of this industry manifested itself in an auto de\r\nfe, celebrated June 6, 1511, in which eight persons were burnt.[21]\r\n\r\nHe was speedily furnished with a colleague, for royal letters of June\r\n18th and 24th inform us of the appointment of a second inquisitor, in\r\nthe person of Doctor Diego de Bonilla, promoted from the position of\r\nfiscal, to whom Obregon was ordered to pay a salary of 6000 sueldos,\r\nwhile the new fiscal, Leonardo Vázquez de Cepeda was to receive 2000 and\r\nthe notary, Pedro de Barahona the same. It was one thing, however, to\r\ngrant salaries and quite another to get them paid, in the habitual\r\nmismanagement of inquisitorial business. From a letter of September 17th\r\nwe learn that Obregon had left Sicily in the fleet, placing as his\r\nsubstitute his son, a boy of 15 or 16. The salaries had fallen greatly\r\nin arrears and the boy declared that he had no funds save twenty ounces,\r\nwhile Inquisitor Bernal asserted that he had imposed fines and pecuniary\r\npenances to the amount of thirteen hundred ducats, besides considerable\r\nconfiscations, which should be ample to meet all salaries and expenses,\r\nwhereupon Ferdinand ordered the viceroy to investigate the accounts and\r\ndiscover where the money had gone.[22]\r\n\r\nThese were not the only difficulties which the tribunal had to\r\nencounter. Accustomed as the people had been for centuries to the\r\nexistence of the Inquisition, the Spanish institution was a very\r\ndifferent affair, not only as to activity and severity but still more\r\nfrom the privileges and immunities claimed and enforced by its officials\r\nand their servants and familiars, especially their exemption from taxes\r\nand import dues and their _fuero_ or right to the jurisdiction of the\r\nInquisition, whether as plaintiffs or defendants, giving rise to\r\nperpetual irritation through the oppression and injustice thus rendered\r\npossible. These innovations were not admitted without resistance, which\r\nFerdinand sought to repress by a letter of September 10, 1508, ordering\r\nBelorado to see that his officials were as well treated in these\r\nrespects as elsewhere in the Spanish dominions. This received scant\r\nobedience for, on November 14, 1509, he wrote to the _stratico_ of\r\nPalermo expressing extreme displeasure on learning that he had arrested\r\na scrivener of the tribunal and had deprived other officials of their\r\narms; in future he must maintain their privileges and exemptions and\r\nshow them every favor and protection.[23] Yet Ferdinand knew that the\r\ntroubles arose from the over-weening pretensions of the tribunal and its\r\nofficials for, in a letter of July 30, 1510, to Bernal he attributed\r\nthem to the exorbitant invasions of the royal jurisdiction by the\r\ninquisitors and their appointment of men of evil life who caused\r\nscandal and infamy. Bernal must bear in mind that, in Sicily, the\r\nprerogatives of the crown were greater than elsewhere; whenever he had\r\nto take action in matters unconnected with heresy he must consult the\r\nviceroy or advocate fiscal, so as to avoid prejudice to the royal\r\npre-eminence; he must also furnish to the viceroy a list of officials,\r\nservants and familiars, the latter not to exceed ten in number.[24]\r\n\r\nInquisitors, especially of distant tribunals, were not accustomed to pay\r\nmuch heed to instructions inculcating moderation in the exercise of\r\ntheir powers and the Sicilians were indisposed to submission. We learn\r\nfrom a royal letter of December 25, 1510, that the jurats objected to\r\ntaking the customary oath of obedience to inquisitors and that the local\r\nauthorities persisted in levying taxes on the officials.[25] Relations\r\nwere strained and disaffection grew until there was an explosion on St.\r\nBernard’s day, August 20, 1511, when the people rose with demands that\r\nthe privileges of the officials should be curtailed--a rising which\r\ncost, it is said, the lives of a thousand Spanish soldiers.[26] Neither\r\nthis warning nor Ferdinand’s exhortations abated the pretensions of the\r\nHoly Office. A letter of the viceroy, Hugo de Moncada, September 6,\r\n1512, relates that when some troops pursued a band of robbers and\r\narrested them in the country-house of an inquisitor, where they had\r\nsought refuge, the latter threatened the captain and his men with\r\nexcommunication if the prisoners were not released and then claimed\r\njurisdiction to try them, on the ground of the place of their\r\ncapture.[27] This was by no means an isolated case for soon afterwards\r\ntwo other flagrant examples of similar character evoked from Ferdinand,\r\nOctober 25th, an order to rescind their action, coupled with an\r\nexpression of extreme displeasure at their thus affording protection to\r\nmalefactors on one pretext or another. Their behavior in the\r\ncustom-house to evade the payment of duties was a further subject of\r\nanimadversion and he warned them sternly to avoid in future creating\r\nsuch scandals.[28]\r\n\r\nThis somewhat exuberant zeal in asserting their privileges was\r\naccompanied with corresponding activity in the performance of their\r\nregular duties. In 1513 there were three autos de fe celebrated, in\r\nwhich the burnings aggregated thirty-nine, a large portion being of\r\nthose who had been previously reconciled and had relapsed, thus\r\nindicating the increased vigilance of the tribunal.[29] A further\r\nevidence of this was the arrival, in September, 1513, at Naples, of four\r\nhundred fugitives, including a number of priests and friars, to escape\r\nthe rigor of the inquisitors, who they said were endeavoring to force\r\nconfessors to reveal the confessions of their penitents.[30] One\r\ngratifying result of this activity was the financial ease afforded by\r\nthe resultant large confiscations. A letter of Ferdinand’s to Obregon,\r\nJune 27, 1513, calls his attention to them and to those anticipated from\r\nthe number of prisoners on trial, requiring greater care than had\r\nhitherto been devoted to the management; the officials were now\r\nreceiving their salaries and doing their duty. In spite of this warning\r\nwe find, a year later, that Obregon had abruptly quitted Palermo,\r\nleaving the affairs of the office in confusion, rendering necessary the\r\nappointment, June 15, 1514, of a successor, Garcí Cid, who was\r\ninstructed to reduce it to order and to invest in ground-rents twelve\r\nhundred ounces which Obregon had deposited in a bank.[31] That the\r\nprofits of persecution continued is evidenced by a gift made, March 30,\r\n1515, by Ferdinand, to his wife, Queen Germaine, of all the\r\nconfiscations of that year, in the city of Syracuse and district of the\r\nCamera reginale, up to the sum of ten thousand florins--a gift which\r\nGarcí Cid was ordered to keep secret until after he should have rendered\r\na statement of all that was on hand and was expected.[32]\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps not surprising that this increased effectiveness of the\r\ntribunal stimulated popular discontent, which found expression in a\r\npetition from the Sicilian Parliament asking Ferdinand that the\r\nInquisition be required to observe the ancient canons and methods of\r\nprocedure, for many of those burnt in the autos asserted their\r\ninnocence, declaring that their confessions had been extorted by torture\r\nand dying with every sign of being good Christians. It was further asked\r\nthat some limit be put to the issue of licences to bear arms and as to\r\nthe kind of persons licensed; that the judge of confiscations should\r\nhave a fixed salary and should not exact fees and that there should be\r\nan appeal from him to the viceroy; also that those who in good faith\r\nentered into contracts with persons reputed to be good Christians should\r\nbe able to collect their debts, in place of having them included in the\r\nconfiscation, the contrary practice being destructive to trade and\r\ncommerce.[33] There was also a special embassy from Palermo, complaining\r\nthat the inquisitors required the city authorities to renew every year\r\nthe oath of obedience and that they issued licences to bear arms to men\r\nof evil life who caused much disorder and scandal.[34] Ferdinand\r\npromised relief of these grievances and, in due course, a fresh series\r\nof instructions was issued, in 1515, by Bishop Martin de Aspeitia and\r\nthe Aragonese Supreme Council, or Suprema. It limited the number of\r\nfamiliars to thirty for Palermo, to twenty for Messina and Catania, to\r\nfifteen for Syracuse and Trapani and to not over ten in other places;\r\nthey were to be men of approved character and were to carry certificates\r\nidentifying them, in the absence of which they could be disarmed by the\r\nsecular authorities. If officials were accused of serious crime, the\r\nevidence was to be sent to the inquisitor-general when, if the proof was\r\nsufficient, the offender would be dismissed and the inquisitor who had\r\ntolerated it would be punished. Officials were deprived of the _voz\r\nactiva_ or right as plaintiffs to the jurisdiction of the tribunal,\r\nalthough Dr. Martin Real assures us that experience had already shown\r\nthat they could not exist without it, so universally were they detested.\r\nTheir buying up of claims and matters in litigation, in which they had\r\nthe benefit of the tribunal as a court, was prohibited. The dowries of\r\nwives were protected from confiscation when husbands were convicted and\r\ndealings with those in good repute as Christians were held good, in case\r\nof confiscation, so that the claims of creditors were allowed and, if\r\nthe fisc desired to seize alienated real estate, it was required to\r\nrefund the purchase-money to the buyer.[35] There were various other\r\nreforms embodied in the instructions, all indicating a desire to avoid\r\ninjustice to innocent third parties, but the whole is interesting rather\r\nas an exposure of customary abuses than as effecting their removal,\r\nalthough when, towards the close of 1514 a new inquisitor, Miguel\r\nCervera by name, was sent to Sicily, he was ordered to obey to the\r\nletter the instructions of Torquemada and his successors and not to\r\nincrease the number of officials without permission.[36]\r\n\r\nHowever praiseworthy may have been the intentions at headquarters, it\r\nwas impossible to control the tribunal or to allay popular hostility,\r\nwhich found opportunity for expression after the death of Ferdinand,\r\nFebruary 23, 1516. Hugo de Moncada had held the office of viceroy for\r\nsix years and had earned universal hatred by his cruelty, greed and\r\nlust. Among other devices, he had monopolized the corn-trade and, by his\r\nexportations, had reduced the island almost to starvation, though its\r\nfertility rendered it the granary of the Mediterranean, while the\r\npoverty of the people was aggravated by an adulterated currency.[37] He\r\nconcealed the news of Ferdinand’s death, in hopes of reappointment by\r\nCharles V, but it became known and the people, led by some powerful\r\nnobles, claimed that his commission had expired. While the popular mind\r\nwas thus excited, Fra Hieronimo da Verona, in his lenten sermons in\r\nPalermo, denounced as sacrilegious the wearing of red crosses on the\r\ngreen penitential sanbenitos of the reconciled heretics, who were very\r\nnumerous, and he urged the people to tear off the symbol of Christ from\r\nthe heretical penitents. His advice was followed and the aspect of the\r\nmob grew more and more threatening. Moncada attempted to quiet matters\r\nby proclaiming Charles and Juana, abolishing an obnoxious corn-tax and\r\nexhibiting letters from Charles confirming him in office. These were\r\ndenounced as forgeries; a man who demanded to see them was arrested by\r\nthe prefect and rescued by the people, while the prefect was obliged to\r\nfly for his life. That night, March 7, 1516, an immense crowd, with\r\nartillery taken from the arsenal, besieged the vice-regal palace;\r\nMoncada, disguised as a serving-man, escaped by a postern to the house\r\nof a friend, whence he took refuge on a ship in the harbor and sailed\r\nfor Messina, which consented to receive him. After sacking the palace,\r\nthe mob turned its attention to the Inquisition. Cervera saved his life\r\nby taking a consecrated host in a monstrance, under protection of which\r\nhe gained the harbor, amid the jeers and insults of the people, who\r\ncried that he was an inquisitor and hunter of money, not of heretics. He\r\ntook ship for Spain, while the mob released the prisoners, destroyed the\r\nrecords and pillaged the property of the Inquisition. The Palermitans\r\nfollowed this with an embassy to Charles, complaining of the evil doings\r\nof Moncada and the disorders caused by the Inquisition which had\r\nwell-nigh destroyed their city. The sole object of its officials they\r\nsaid was to accumulate money and they would lay down their lives rather\r\nthan see it restored, except under the ancient form as carried on by the\r\nbishops and Dominicans. Cervera betook himself to Flanders to solicit\r\nhis restoration, but the island held out and, for three years, there was\r\nno Inquisition in Sicily, except in Messina and its territory.[38]\r\n\r\nEnlightened by the insurrection and the Palermitan complaints, the\r\nSuprema or supreme council of Aragon, on August 29, 1516, sent to\r\nCentelles, Bishop of Syracuse, a commission to investigate the tribunal,\r\nwith a list of interrogatories from which it appears that Cervera had\r\nfilled the office with his kindred and servants, while every kind of\r\npillage and oppression is suggested, even to the rifling of the\r\ntreasure-chest by the officials on the day of the tumult. Bishop\r\nCentelles, however, had died on August 22d; of course no investigation\r\nwas made and the Suprema contented itself with expressing, on October\r\n27th, to Charles its gratification at his determination to restore with\r\nthe greatest honor the tribunal which had been expelled with such\r\ndisgrace.[39] This, however, was not so readily accomplished. Some seven\r\nmonths later, on June 15, 1517, Charles wrote to the Sicilian viceroy\r\nordering Cervera to be received back and obeyed under penalty of the\r\nroyal wrath and three thousand crowns but, for a time, this was a dead\r\nletter. Cervera returned to Spain when Charles went there, in 1517, and\r\nit was not until 1519 that Sicily was sufficiently pacified to render it\r\nexpedient to send him back. A royal cédula of May 29, 1519, announces\r\nthis and orders Garcí Cid, the receiver, to pay him 343 ducats for his\r\naccrued salary without deduction for absence, and, when the cédula of\r\nJune 15, 1517, was published at last on July 6, 1519, it was not in\r\nPalermo but in Messina, where the Marquis of Monteleone, the new\r\nviceroy, was still residing. Meanwhile a certain Giovanni Martino da\r\nAquino had been enjoying the title of inquisitor there, but he was\r\nremoved, May 20, 1519, in favor of Cervera. A second inquisitor, Tristan\r\nCalvete had been appointed in 1517 and had been welcomed in Messina.[40]\r\n\r\nCalvete’s first act was to issue an edict, May 16, 1518, requiring,\r\nunder pain of excommunication, all papers and property of the\r\nInquisition to be returned within fifteen days and the anathema duly\r\nfollowed on June 6th.[41] Presumably this produced little result;\r\nPalermo, the seat of the tribunal and scene of insurrection, had not yet\r\nreturned to obedience; the records had been destroyed and their lack\r\nlong remained a source of embarrassment. The tribunal however, in 1519,\r\nwas re-established and fully manned; it celebrated an auto de fe, June\r\n11, 1519 and, for five or six years, there seems to have been one nearly\r\nevery year, but the number of executions was not large.[42] Popular\r\nantagonism was by no means disarmed, for we find Calvete issuing,\r\nSeptember 29, 1525, two edicts, one commanding everyone to aid and favor\r\nthe Inquisition and not to defend heretics, and the other summoning all\r\ncognizant of the numerous _penitenciados_ and their descendants, who\r\ndisregarded the disabilities imposed on them, to denounce them.[43]\r\n\r\nThere was ample cause for disaffection, arising, not from sympathy with\r\nheresy, but from the arbitrary proceedings of those who regarded\r\npersecution primarily as a source of enrichment. Instructions given,\r\nJuly 31, 1517, by Cardinal Adrian to Calvete, commence with the remark\r\nthat all inquisitors thus far sent to Sicily had disregarded the rules\r\nof the Holy Office, both as to civil and criminal procedure, as to\r\nconfiscations and as to familiars. It was therefore ordered that all\r\nofficials, under pain of excommunication, should inviolably observe the\r\ninstructions, including those given to Melchor Cervera; the whole body\r\nof these rules was ordered to be read in presence of all the officials\r\nassembled for the purpose, a notarial act being taken to attest the\r\nfact. Moreover, in addition to excommunication for violations of the\r\nrules, the special penalties provided were to be irrevocably enforced.\r\nFollowing this were particular instructions for the correction of abuses\r\nwhich indicate how completely the interests of the fisc and the rights\r\nof the people were subordinated to official cupidity. One of the\r\npractices prohibited shows how repulsive the religion of Christ, in\r\nsuch hands, was rendered to converts. The inquisitors, it appears, were\r\nin the habit of making reconciled penitents and baptized neophytes labor\r\non the fortifications of the castle; when they did not appear at the\r\nappointed hour they were fined and these fines, which were collected by\r\nZamporron, the messenger of the tribunal, amounted to a considerable\r\nsum, of which no account was rendered.[44] In this, as in all similar\r\ndenunciations of malversations and abuses, a noteworthy feature is that\r\npunishment is always threatened for the future and none is inflicted for\r\nthe past; no one is dismissed and the thieving and corrupt officials are\r\nallowed unmolested to continue their career of plunder and oppression.\r\n\r\nApparently Cardinal Adrian was advised that his instructions were not\r\nobeyed and he sent Master Benito Mercader as “visitor” or inspector to\r\nreport on the condition of the tribunal. Before this report was\r\nreceived, Adrian had passed through the papacy to the tomb, and it was\r\nacted upon by his successor, Manrique, Archbishop of Seville, who\r\nissued, January 31, 1525, a fresh set of instructions, based on its\r\nrevelations. From this it would appear that there was little in which\r\nthe inquisitors and their officials did not violate the rules, both in\r\nthe conduct of trials and management of the finances. There seems, in\r\nfact, to have been a Saturnalia of peculation. Collections were made by\r\nboth authorized and unauthorized persons, of which no accounts were\r\nkept. The fines and pecuniary penances, which formed so lucrative a\r\nsource of income, were kept from the knowledge of the notary of\r\nsequestrations so that he could make no charge of them to the receiver.\r\nOfficials claimed and received twenty or twenty-five per cent. for\r\ndiscovering hidden confiscated property, their knowledge of which was\r\nacquired officially. The Christian slaves of condemned heretics were\r\nsold in place of being set free, according to law. Inquisitors and\r\ntheir subordinates received “presents,” or rather bribes, from penitents\r\nand litigants, which perhaps explains the complaint that sentences to\r\nthe galleys and other penalties were not executed and that the\r\ndisabilities and sanbenitos of those reconciled were not enforced. There\r\nis significance in the instructions for the collection of the two\r\nhundred gold ducats, which the late inquisitor, Melchor Cervera,\r\nhad bequeathed to the Inquisition for the discharge of his\r\nconscience--probably but a small portion of the irregular gains for\r\nwhich he had had ample opportunity. As a whole, this inside picture of\r\nthe Holy Office shows us how completely it was converted into an engine\r\nfor oppression and peculation and how little there was of genuine\r\nfanaticism to serve as an excuse for its existence, but, as usual, there\r\nare no dismissals or punishments inflicted and the only remedy proposed\r\nis the formal semi-annual reading of the instructions to the officials.\r\nThat they should continue to be the objects of popular detestation was\r\ninevitable, and the complaint is made that their maltreatment and the\r\nresistance offered to them remain unpunished.[45]\r\n\r\nThis was the only point on which reformation was attempted. Charles V,\r\nin a letter to his viceroy, October 22, 1525, says that he understands\r\nthat the royal courts take cognizance of the cases of the officials of\r\nthe tribunal, which displeases him greatly; it is his will that the Holy\r\nOffice shall be cherished and favored and that in all cases, civil and\r\ncriminal, its officials are to enjoy the immunities and privileges to\r\nwhich they are entitled; they are to exercise their functions with all\r\nfreedom, under the royal protection, guarded by the penalties expressed\r\nin the royal concessions. This was supplemented by another cédula of\r\nAugust 25, 1526, taking the inquisitors and their officials under the\r\nroyal safeguard and ordering that they should have all aid and support\r\nand protection from the secular authorities.[46]\r\n\r\nAs for the wrongs committed by the inquisitors, their continuance is\r\nshown by repeated petitions from the Sicilian Parliament, which indicate\r\nhow completely the instructions of 1515 and 1517 were ignored, while\r\nCharles’s replies--probably drawn up for him by the Suprema--prove how\r\nlittle hope there was of redress through an appeal to the throne. The\r\nParliament represented that the Conversos who remained were few and\r\npoor, the rest having fled or been condemned, wherefore the inquisitors\r\ndespoiled the native Christians of their property, to remedy which it\r\nasked as before that in future the Inquisition should be conducted by\r\nthe bishops and Dominicans as of old. To this the answer was that he\r\nwould consult the pope. It was also asked that Christians who had, in\r\ngood faith, made contracts with reputed Catholics and thus were their\r\ncreditors, should have their claims recognized and satisfied out of the\r\nconfiscated property of a condemned debtor. This shows that the\r\ninstructions of 1515 to this effect had been disregarded and there was\r\nlittle hope of improvement in Charles’s assent with the nullifying\r\nproviso that there must be a prescription of thirty years’ possession,\r\nconcerning which he would write to the pope. A further request was that\r\nthe dowries of orthodox wives should not be subject to confiscation and\r\nthat children’s portions should be exempted, to which the reply was\r\n“agreed as to dowries received before the commission of heresy; for the\r\nrest, the pope will be consulted.” Another point was that, in case of\r\ndenial of justice or evident scandal, the viceroy could appoint some\r\nprelate who, with the Gran Corte or the doctors, could decide the\r\nmatter. This was rejected with the declaration that all appeals must be\r\nto the inquisitor-general. It was further asked that each inquisitor\r\nwhen he came should file his commission in the ordinary public\r\nregisters, so that every one could learn what was his authority, for the\r\ninquisitors often exceeded their lawful powers. Complaint was also made\r\nthat the officials abused their immunities and privileges by engaging in\r\ntrade and it was asked that in suits thence arising they should be\r\nsubjected to the vice-regal or episcopal courts, to which Charles\r\nreplied that he had given orders to the inquisitor-general to see to\r\nthis.[47]\r\n\r\nThus supported, the Inquisition pursued its course and held one or more\r\nautos de fe every year, until 1534, though the number of burnings was\r\nnot excessive, the summary for the nine years showing only thirty-nine\r\nvictims relaxed to the secular arm, the most of whom suffered for\r\nrelapse after previous conviction and reconciliation.[48] While thus\r\nperforming its full duties to the faith, the consciousness of imperial\r\nsupport had not led it to mend its ways or to reform abuses, and popular\r\nopposition was undiminished, for Charles found it necessary to issue\r\nanother rescript, January 18, 1535, addressed to Viceroy Monteleone,\r\nconfirming at much length the privileges and exemptions of the officials\r\nfrom secular jurisdiction and their right to bear arms.[49] When,\r\nhowever, in the following September, Charles visited Palermo, on his\r\nreturn from his crusade to Tunis, and listened to the earnest\r\nrepresentations of the Parliament, his convictions changed--a change\r\npossibly facilitated by a subsidy granted to him of two hundred and\r\nfifty thousand ducats over and above the ordinary revenue.[50] He\r\nsuspended, for a period of five years, the jurisdiction of the\r\nInquisition in all cases involving the death-penalty and not connected\r\nwith matters of faith, and, when this term had elapsed, he prolonged the\r\nsuspension for five years more.[51] The historians of the Inquisition\r\ntell us that this resulted in the unchecked multiplication of heretics\r\namong the noblest families, while the hatred of the people for its\r\nrepresentatives manifested itself without fear of punishment. There can,\r\nin fact, be little doubt that its operations were crippled on this\r\naccount, for its officials were no longer shielded from popular anger as\r\nsoon as offences committed against them became cognizable by the secular\r\ncourts in sympathy with the offenders. Thus when the Inquisitor\r\nBartolomé Sebastian made a visitation of the town of Jaca, with his\r\nofficials and servants, and published the Edict of Faith, the\r\ninhabitants piled up wood around the house in which they were lodged and\r\nwould have burnt them all had not the Baroness de la Florida assembled\r\nher kinsmen and retainers, raised the siege and enabled them to escape.\r\nSoon afterwards, when the alguazil and his assistants went to San Marcos\r\nto arrest some heretics, they were set upon by Matteo Garruba and his\r\naccomplices; he was left for dead and some of his people were slain.[52]\r\nApparently the danger, of which these are examples, caused the\r\ninquisitors to confine their labors to the larger cities for, in\r\nJanuary, 1543, Inquisitor-general Tavera ordered a general visitation of\r\nthe island, which he says had not been performed for a long while. In\r\nJune a new inquisitor, the Licentiate Gongora, was sent with special\r\ninstructions to carry out this visitation and peremptory orders were\r\nissued by Prince Philip that he and his officials should be efficiently\r\nprotected.[53] Another manifestation of popular repugnance was the\r\nresistance offered to the invariable custom in Spain of hanging in the\r\nchurches the sanbenitos of the condemned, or linens with inscriptions of\r\ntheir names, heresies and punishment, thus perpetuating their infamy,\r\nwhich was one of the severest features of the penalty of heresy. Páramo\r\nexplains that this was not observed in Sicily for when, in 1543,\r\nInquisitor Cervera endeavored to introduce it, by hanging them in the\r\nchurch of St. Dominic, there arose so great a tumult that he was obliged\r\nto abandon the attempt and it had never since then been possible to\r\neffect it, up to his time (1598).[54] To add to the embarrassment of the\r\ntribunal, it was or professed to be impoverished. When its alguazil\r\nMarcos Calderon died, there was owing to him for arrears of salary 155\r\nounces, 24 tarines and 9 granos, and in February, 1543, the receiver\r\nFrancisco Cid declared his inability to pay this to the heirs. To\r\nrelieve him the Suprema agreed to place half the burden of this on the\r\ntribunal of Granada and, by letter of May 30, 1544, ordered Cid to pay\r\nthe other half.[55]\r\n\r\nIn spite of popular disaffection and curtailment of temporal\r\njurisdiction, the Inquisition continued its deadly work. On May 30,\r\n1541, there was celebrated at Palermo an auto in which twenty-two\r\nculprits appeared, nineteen of them for Judaizing and three for\r\nLutheranism--among the latter Fra Perruccio Campagna, a tertiary of San\r\nFrancisco de Paola, who courted martyrdom and was burnt as an obstinate\r\nimpenitent heretic.[56] By this time Lutheranism was much more dreaded\r\nthan Judaism. In view of its threatening spread and of the occasional\r\noutbursts of popular detestation, there was probably little difficulty\r\nin convincing Charles that he had made a mistake in limiting the\r\nexemptions of the officials; he announced in advance his intention of\r\nnot prolonging the limitation and, by letters of February 27, 1543, he\r\nordered his Sicilian officials, after the expiration of the term, to\r\ngive the Inquisition full liberty of action and not to interfere with it\r\nin any way under a penalty of two thousand ounces. When the term\r\nexpired, Prince Philip, as regent of the Spanish dominions, by a decree\r\nof June 18, 1546, published the letters of 1543 and ordered their strict\r\nobservance.[57]\r\n\r\nIt would seem that even before the expiration of the term the tribunal\r\narrogantly and successfully asserted the immunity of its officials from\r\nsecular law. Juan de Aragon, Duke of Terranova, was Constable and\r\nAdmiral of Naples, a Spanish grandee of the first class and kinsman of\r\nCharles V, acting as President or Governor of Sicily, in the absence of\r\nthe viceroy. In this capacity he had occasion to torture and condemn to\r\nthe galleys Maestro Antonio Bertin, a familiar, and to imprison some\r\nother familiars. The inquisitors took up the matter and sentenced him to\r\nperform public penance, to release Bertin and to pay him a _solatium_ of\r\ntwo hundred ducats. The case was of course carried to Spain, where both\r\nsides were heard and as usual the decision was against the crown and in\r\nfavor of the Inquisition. Prince Philip conveyed this to Terranova by\r\nletter of December 16, 1543, exhorting him to submit to it willingly and\r\nnot to wait to be compelled by excommunication. Terranova recalcitrated\r\nagainst the public humiliation and finally a letter of Philip, April 24,\r\n1544, remitted the penance, when the duke released and compensated the\r\ncriminal.[58]\r\n\r\nSuch an occurrence does not justify the assertion made by Prince Philip,\r\nJune 15, 1546, when a new inquisitor, Bartolomé Sebastian, was sent to\r\nPalermo, that the officials of the Sicilian Holy Office were held in\r\nsuch contempt and were so impeded in their functions that they could\r\nscarce discharge their duties, wherefore special injunctions were laid\r\non him to exact from all authorities the oath of obedience, while every\r\nassistance was emphatically ordered to be rendered to him.[59] In fact,\r\nalmost simultaneously with these utterances, an auto de fe, held June 6,\r\n1546, showed that there was no impediment to the discharge of the proper\r\nfunctions of the inquisition. In this auto there were no living bodies\r\ndelivered to the stake, but the effigies of four fugitives answered the\r\npurpose of demonstrating that the authority of the tribunal was\r\nundiminished. Sebastian indicated how far that authority extended when,\r\nin 1547, he repeated the prohibition of Conversos expatriating\r\nthemselves and their families under pain of confiscation, while a fine\r\nof two hundred ounces was decreed against shipmasters transporting such\r\npersons without special licence. This recrudescence of inquisitorial\r\nactivity aroused the Parliament, which petitioned Charles V that the\r\naccused should have copies of the evidence against them, with the names\r\nof the witnesses, so that his faithful subjects should not perish\r\nundefended, through false testimony suborned by enmity, but the emperor\r\nturned this off with a vague promise that Sicilians should not be unduly\r\nmolested. This did not soothe popular hostility, for a letter of the\r\nRegent Juana to the Viceroy Juan de Vega, September 29, 1549, thanks him\r\nfor the solicitude which he has shown in protecting the rights and\r\nimmunities of the Inquisition, seeing that recently some of its\r\nofficials have been wounded and slain while discharging their duties.\r\nPossibly this may refer to the case of Giacomo Achiti, who was relaxed\r\nto the secular arm, May 19, 1549, for having with others resisted and\r\nslain Giovanni de Landeras, a minister of the Inquisition. Yet whatever\r\nmay have been the good will of Vega, it was impossible for a viceroy to\r\nperform his duties and remain on good terms with the Holy Office. In\r\nthis same year, 1549, a certain D. Pietro di Gregorio had torture\r\nadministered to a familiar, for which Alberto Albertini, Bishop of Patti\r\nand inquisitor, threw him in prison, when Vega liberated him by force\r\nand was duly reproved therefore by Charles.[60]\r\n\r\nIn the numerous autos de fe which are recorded during the following\r\nyears, it is interesting to observe that Judaism sinks into the\r\nbackground and that the predominant heresies punished are Protestant.\r\nThe Inquisition was aroused to renewed activity and its victims, whether\r\nburnt or penanced, were numbered by scores.[61] It is probable that\r\npeculation and waste continued for a letter of the inquisitors, April 2,\r\n1560, to Philip II congratulates him on the prospect of some large\r\nconfiscations impending; these, they say, will relieve the tribunal,\r\nwhich is deeply in debt and it is suggested to the king that if he will\r\ninvest the proceeds in ground-rents, the income will go far to pay the\r\nsalaries and perpetuate the institution. Apparently the suggestion was\r\nunheeded for the complaints of poverty and indebtedness continue; the\r\nconvicts are mostly poor people, whose property barely meets their\r\nprison expenses, and some rich abbey is asked for, of which the revenues\r\nmay be devoted to this holy cause.[62]\r\n\r\nWhether the complaint of poverty be true or not, the inquisitors had\r\nample opportunity of irregular gains. The privileges and immunities of\r\nits officials rendered the position of familiar eagerly sought for and,\r\nin an age of corruption, we may reasonably assume that it was liberally\r\npaid for. In addition to this, the exclusive jurisdiction over them, in\r\nboth civil and criminal matters, was very lucrative, not only from the\r\nfees exacted for every transaction in suits and trials, but from the\r\ncustom of punishment by fines for all delinquencies. It is noteworthy\r\nthat in the discussions which arose, it was assumed on all sides that\r\nthe fuero of the tribunal was equivalent to immunity for crime, and so\r\nit was as far as corporal penalties were concerned, but pecuniary ones\r\nwere a profitable substitute, which enured exclusively to the tribunal.\r\nI have not met with any trials of Sicilian officials, but this was the\r\ncustom in the Peninsula and it is an unavoidable assumption that the\r\nexample was followed in the island. In addition to this was the\r\ninfluence derivable from thus enrolling an army under the inquisitorial\r\nbanner, and thus there were ample motives for disregarding the\r\nlimitations placed by the instructions on the number of appointments.\r\nThe viceroy, Marc’ Antonio Colonna, in a letter of November 3, 1577,\r\nstates that there were twenty-five thousand familiars and that the\r\ninquisitors proposed to increase them to thirty thousand; they included,\r\nhe says, all the nobles, the rich men and the criminals.[63] It was\r\npractically an alliance between the tribunal on one side and the\r\ninfluential and the dangerous classes on the other, against the\r\nvice-regal government and the courts, rendering impossible the orderly\r\nadministration of justice and the maintenance of public peace. The\r\nviceroys were involved in perpetual struggles with the Holy Office and\r\nwere constantly remonstrating with the home government, but to little\r\neffect. An attempt was made to amend the situation by an agreement,\r\nknown as the Concordia of Badajoz, July 4, 1580, which was, in reality,\r\na surrender of the secular authorities to the Inquisition. In Castile, a\r\nnumber of the more serious crimes were excepted from the exemption of\r\nfamiliars, but in Sicily they were entitled to the jurisdiction of the\r\ntribunal for all offences, however atrocious. This was continued by the\r\nConcordia, which provided that, whenever a case involving an official or\r\nfamiliar should come before the viceroy, he should promptly hand it over\r\nto the tribunal. The inquisitors were empowered to excommunicate judges\r\nwho interfered with their jurisdiction and the judge so excommunicated\r\nwas required to present himself before them, to beg for absolution and\r\nto promise obedience. Provision however was made for _competencias_, or\r\nconferences between judges and inquisitors on disputed questions when,\r\nif they could not agree, the matter was referred to the king for final\r\ndecision--a process which usually prolonged it indefinitely.[64]\r\n\r\nThe secular authorities were naturally restive under this and quarrels\r\ncontinued. In 1589 there was an outbreak, when the Gran Corte undertook\r\nto try a familiar named Antonio Ferrante. The Inquisition claimed him;\r\nthe viceroy, the Count of Alva, was less enduring than some of his\r\npredecessors; he caused the sentence of hanging to be executed and, in\r\nthe ensuing recriminations, he imprisoned the consultors of the\r\nInquisition and its judge of confiscations. Both parties appealed to\r\nPhilip II who, after examining all the documents, wrote to Alba, March\r\n29, 1590, strongly reproving him for bringing such scandal and discredit\r\non an institution so necessary for the peace and quiet of the land. In\r\nfuture he must strictly observe the Concordia and the judges of the Gran\r\nCorte must present themselves individually before the inquisitors and\r\nobey their commands. Alba apparently had argued that the consultors were\r\nnot formally officials, for in 1591 Philip decided that they were so and\r\nwere entitled to all the privileges of that position.[65]\r\n\r\nPhilip was firmly convinced that the Inquisition was essential to keep\r\nSicily in subjection, which accounts for his upholding it against his\r\nown representatives, but his eyes were somewhat opened by another case\r\nwhich was in progress at the same time. Count Mussumelli, a familiar,\r\nwas charged with the murder of Giuseppe Bajola, fiscal of the Gran\r\nCorte; he was claimed by the Inquisition and took refuge in its prison.\r\nFrom this the Count of Alva took him forcibly, whereupon the inquisitors\r\nexcommunicated the subordinates concerned in the act and, finding this\r\nineffective, on April 6, 1590, they not only laid an interdict on the\r\nwhole city, but stretched their jurisdiction by prohibiting all vessels\r\nfrom leaving the port. This brought Alba to terms; Mussumelli was\r\nrestored to the inquisitorial prison and the interdict was lifted.[66]\r\nThe case was necessarily carried up to the king and, as usual, was\r\nreferred to a _junta_ consisting of two members each of the Suprema and\r\nof the Council of Italy. To the consulta which they in due course\r\npresented, Philip replied, expressing his grief at the atrocious crimes\r\nof recent occurrence in Sicily. That of the Count Mussumelli was so\r\naggravated that its impunity would render difficult the enforcement of\r\njustice and he must therefore be remitted to the viceroy and judges of\r\nthe Gran Corte. As for the Count of Rocalmuto and the Marquis of la\r\nRochela, they were to be left to the Inquisition, in full confidence\r\nthat their punishment would correspond to the enormity of their\r\noffences, for which he charged the inquisitor-general and Suprema.\r\nMoreover, to prevent such occurrences for the future, he decreed that\r\nthe crime of assassination should be excepted from the immunity enjoyed\r\nby familiars and should not be made the subject of competencias. In\r\naddition to this, he proceeded to state that experience had shown the\r\ngreat troubles and scandals arising from nobles being officials and\r\nfamiliars--positions which they sought, not to discharge their duties\r\nbut to commit crimes under the protection of the Inquisition, thus\r\ncreating many quarrels between the jurisdictions to the discredit of\r\nboth, to scandal of the people and hindrance of justice. It would\r\ntherefore be well for the inquisitor-general and Suprema to order that\r\nSicilian nobles be no longer appointed as officials and familiars and\r\nthat existing appointments be called in and revoked, for he had resolved\r\nto order the viceroys and judges to hold that they are not entitled to\r\nthe fuero of the Inquisition. It was unreasonable that so holy a\r\nbusiness should serve as a cover for delinquents and evil-doers and\r\nthere was ample experience that this was their sole object in seeking\r\nthese positions, so that he greatly wondered that the Inquisition\r\nshould persist in a course so damaging to its reputation and so foreign\r\nto the object of its foundation.[67]\r\n\r\nSuch rebuke and such action could only have been elicited from a monarch\r\nlike Philip II by a profound conviction of the unbearable abuses of\r\ninquisitorial jurisdiction. He would more wisely have followed the\r\nexample of his father in suspending wholly that jurisdiction, for the\r\ntribunal continued to exercise it in a manner provocative of continual\r\ndisturbance. At length, in 1595, a junta or conference was formed,\r\nconsisting of two members of the Suprema, Doctors Juan de Zuñiga and\r\nCaldas, and two regents of the Gran Corte, Bruñol and Escudero, to\r\nreach, if possible, an agreement that should lead to peace. There were\r\nmany discussions and tentative attempts which finally resulted in a\r\nconsulta presented to Philip as a compromise acceptable to both sides.\r\nThis commences by stating that the special cases in dispute had been\r\nsettled or laid aside, awaiting further documents, and that for the\r\nfuture it had been agreed that the Concordia of 1580 should be observed\r\nwith certain amendments. The Inquisition was not to protect officials or\r\nfamiliars guilty of treason against the viceroy or his counsellors, of\r\nassassination, of shooting from ambush, of insulting, wounding or\r\nkilling any one in presence of judges of the Gran Corte or Real\r\nPatrimonio. It was the same with familiars who were notaries and\r\ncommitted frauds in that capacity, or were warehousemen and adulterated\r\ncommodities stored with them, or dealers in provisions who used false\r\nweights, or bankers or other debtors delinquent to the Real Patrimonio,\r\nor delinquent taxpayers in general. Widows of officials were to enjoy\r\nthe fuero only so long as they remained unmarried, and servants were\r\nonly to be entitled to it when they were really part of the household\r\nand not merely serving for food and wages, concerning which inquisitors\r\nwere strictly enjoined not to commit frauds. In Palermo and its suburbs\r\nthe number of familiars was limited to one hundred; in towns of sixty\r\nhearths, to one; in other places the Suprema was to decide; they were\r\nto be prohibited from carrying guns in the country and fire-arms of any\r\nkind in the cities. If a judge arrested a familiar or official, he was\r\nat once to send the papers in the case to the inquisitors that they\r\nmight see whether it was excepted or whether there should be a\r\ncompetencia and, in the latter case, the judges were to be invited\r\ncourteously to meet them and not be summoned as inferiors. The judges,\r\nwhen excommunicated, were to apply for absolution and not refuse as\r\nheretofore to do so, thus discrediting inquisitorial censures, but the\r\nviceroy was not to be excommunicated without the assent of the\r\ninquisitor-general. The Regent Bruñol argued earnestly in favor of\r\nincluding rape among the excepted crimes, pointing out how provocative\r\nit was of assassination, when the husband of a woman thus injured saw\r\nthe culprit walking the streets unpunished, and he seems to have\r\nsucceeded in getting it added to the scanty list of those which the\r\nInquisition would permit to be dealt with in the secular courts.[68]\r\n\r\nThus far the conferees agreed, but they differed on the exclusion of\r\nnobles from official position. The members of the Suprema represented to\r\nthe king that, since he had ordered their removal, the Inquisition had\r\nfallen greatly in public estimation and found much difficulty in making\r\narrests; therefore they asked that there might be thirty, who would\r\nalways be selected from the most quiet and peaceable; otherwise the\r\ntribunal would be confined to men of low extraction, who could not make\r\narrests. To this the regents replied that the maintenance of the royal\r\norder was the only means of keeping the nobles and barons obedient to\r\nthe viceroy; in Sicily more than elsewhere this was necessary and\r\nwithout it matters would be worse than before, when the tribunal\r\nexcommunicated the viceroy in the affair of Count Mussumelli; heresy was\r\nunknown, the nobles and barons had never made an arrest and they\r\nobtained the positions solely to gain the privileges.[69] These\r\narguments were unanswerable and the prohibition was maintained. With the\r\naccession of Philip III an attempt was again made to have it repealed;\r\nInquisitor Páramo, in a letter of March 8, 1600, to the new king\r\ndescribed the condition of the tribunal as most deplorable in\r\nconsequence of it, but the appeal was unsuccessful. Philip contented\r\nhimself with secret instructions to the viceroy to enforce the cédula of\r\nJanuary 18, 1535, and the Concordia and to endeavor to come to some\r\nunderstanding with the inquisitors.[70]\r\n\r\nSo far, indeed, was the Inquisition from being oppressed, that it was\r\nseeking to assert exclusive claim to the obedience of its “subjects,” as\r\nthough they were released in all things from the control of the civil\r\nauthorities. Thus, in 1591, the tribunal issued an edict condemning all\r\nits “subjects” who had not revealed the amount of corn possessed by them\r\nor had sold it at unlawful prices--evidently referring to certain\r\nmeasures taken by the government, as was frequently done in times of\r\nscarcity. The Viceroy Alba was quick to recognize this attempt to\r\nsupplant the civil power and he stopped the publication of the edict. He\r\nwas soon afterwards succeeded by Count Olivares, whose temper Inquisitor\r\nPáramo, with characteristic pertinacity, proceeded to test with a\r\nproclamation of April 23, 1592, published throughout the island to sound\r\nof trumpet, reciting the disturbance of public order by bands of\r\nrobbers, against whom and all harboring or favoring them the viceroy had\r\nissued edicts, wherefore he summoned all those subject to the\r\njurisdiction of the Inquisition to abstain from sheltering the said\r\nbandits, under the penalties provided by the laws and of a thousand\r\nounces applicable to the Holy Office. Olivares was no more disposed than\r\nhis predecessor to admit that his actions required inquisitorial\r\nconfirmation and, on May 30th, he issued an edict prohibiting, under\r\nheavy penalties, the publication of the proclamation; if, in any place,\r\nit had been entered on the records of the magistrates, the entry was to\r\nbe erased and no similar orders of the Inquisition were to be received\r\nin future. He moreover told the inquisitors that it was none of their\r\nbusiness to issue decrees on this or any other matter of general policy,\r\nbut simply to obey the laws; that it had been done merely to enlarge\r\ntheir jurisdiction illegally and that the government could not be\r\ndivided into two heads with one body.[71]\r\n\r\nBetween conflicting pretensions such as these, harmony was impossible\r\nand the conclusions of the junta of 1595 did not restore it. Collisions\r\nwere frequent and the extremes to which they were sometimes carried are\r\nseen in one occurring in 1602, when the Gran Corte prosecuted Mariano\r\nAgliata, a familiar, for the murder of Don Diego de Zúñiga and Don Diego\r\nSandoval, a captain and a sergeant of the royal troops. The inquisitors\r\narrested him and claimed jurisdiction and, when the Gran Corte refused\r\nto abandon the prosecution, they excommunicated the judges.\r\nExcommunication by an inquisitor could be removed only by the power\r\nwhich fulminated it or by the pope, but the viceroy, the Duke of Feria,\r\npersuaded the archbishop, Diego de Haëdo, to absolve the judges,\r\nwhereupon the inquisitors interdicted him from performing any functions\r\nuntil he should admit that his absolutions were invalid. At this the\r\nviceroy lost his temper and despatched, August 7th, two companies of\r\nsoldiers to the Inquisition, with a gallows and the executioner. They\r\nremained in front of the building until two o’clock in the morning and\r\nreturned on the 8th in greater force, erected six gallows, each with its\r\nhangman, and stood with lighted matchlocks pointed at the windows. The\r\ninquisitors were not daunted by this impotent display of force; they\r\nbarred the doors, hoisted the standard of the Inquisition, with a papal\r\nflag and a crucifix, and flung out of the windows among the troops\r\nnotices of excommunication. Undeterred by this, the Spaniards broke\r\ntheir way in and, after some parley, the inquisitors promised to absolve\r\nthem. Feria had gone as far as he dared without result and the victory\r\nremained with the inquisitors, for the case of Agliata was surrendered\r\nto them, on their removing the interdict on the archbishop and the\r\nexcommunication of the judges.[72] To emphasize Feria’s defeat, Philip\r\nIII, in 1603, issued a general letter to all of his viceroys, lauding\r\nthe services of the Inquisition and ordering them to give it all the\r\nfavor and assistance it might ask for, and to maintain intact the\r\nprivileges, exemptions and liberties, assured to its ministers and\r\nfamiliars, by law, by the concordias, by the royal cédulas, by use and\r\ncustom and by any other source.[73]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs though these sempiternal conflicts with the civil authorities were\r\nnot sufficiently disturbing to the public peace, the Inquisition was\r\ninvolved in a similar series with the bishops, in which it did not fare\r\nso well, entrenched as they were behind the canon law, which the\r\nmonarchs could not set aside. A portion of the officials of the Holy\r\nOffice were clerics, of whose immunity from the secular courts there\r\ncould be no question, but the bishops claimed, under divine and canon\r\nlaw, an imprescriptible right of cognizance of their offences, when\r\nthese did not concern the faith or their official functions. The\r\ninquisitors held that they possessed exclusive jurisdiction over their\r\nsubordinates and the conflict was waged with abundant lack of Christian\r\ncharity, causing great popular scandal until, as we are told, the people\r\nwere in the habit of asking where was the God of the clergy. The contest\r\nraged chiefly over the commissioners appointed everywhere throughout the\r\nisland, whose duty it was to investigate cases of heresy in their\r\ndistricts and report or, if necessary, make arrests and send the\r\nculprits to Palermo for trial. In 1625 the Suprema endeavored to effect\r\na compromise, by designating what offences were cognizable by the\r\nbishops exclusively, what by the inquisitors and what cumulatively by\r\neither jurisdiction, for that of the bishops could not be denied and the\r\nInquisition had no papal letters to show in support of its claims. This\r\nseems only to have emboldened the bishops and the quarrels continued. In\r\n1630 Philip IV and the inquisitor-general wrote to the viceroy and the\r\ninquisitors, enquiring what was the established custom in such cases,\r\nbut apparently the two ecclesiastical camps could not agree on terms of\r\npeace and nothing was done. In 1642 the inquisitor, Gonsalvo Bravo\r\nGrosero submitted to the Suprema a long and learned paper in which he\r\ndescribes the condition of the Sicilian Inquisition as most deplorable,\r\nin consequence of the implacable hostility of the bishops. It could not\r\npossibly do without commissioners, for the inquisitors could not travel\r\naround to visit the provinces; the roads were too bad and their salaries\r\ntoo meagre to bear the expense, as they could not venture into the\r\ncountry without a guard of at least forty men, in view of the robbers\r\nand bandits. There was not money to pay the commissioners a salary and\r\ntheir only inducement to accept the office was to gain immunity from\r\nepiscopal jurisdiction. As this was virtually denied to them, it became\r\nimpossible to find fitting clerics to undertake the duties, so there\r\nwere many vacancies that could not be filled.\r\n\r\nGrosero evidently did not pause to consider the reflection cast on the\r\ncharacter of the clerics thus anxious to find refuge in the Inquisition\r\nfrom the courts of their bishops, but the cases which he mentions, if\r\nnot exaggerated, testify amply to the virulence of episcopal\r\nvindictiveness. Recently, he says, the tribunal became involved in a\r\nquarrel with the Bishop of Syracuse over the case of a familiar.\r\nIndignant at its methods, the bishop indulged in reprisals on the\r\nunlucky commissioner of Lentini, on a charge of incontinence; he was\r\nseized by a band of armed clerics, stripped and carried on a mule to\r\nprison as a malefactor and cast into a dungeon where he lay, deprived of\r\nall communication with his friends, until the Bishop of Cefalù, then\r\ngovernor of the island, procured his release, but his persecution\r\ncontinued for two years. So the Bishop of Girgenti seized the\r\ncommissioner of Caltanexeda because he had, under orders from the\r\ntribunal, stopped the prosecution of a familiar. He was confined in a\r\ndamp, underground cell for forty days, until the viceroy procured his\r\nrelease, and his unwholesome confinement nearly cost him his life. The\r\nimpelling cause of Grosero’s memorial was a pending case, which scarcely\r\nevokes sympathy with his complaints. Alessandro Turano, commissioner of\r\nBurgio, had given refuge in his house to a kinsman, a monk guilty of\r\nmurder, and had refused admission to the officers who came to arrest the\r\ncriminal. For this the Bishop of Girgenti was prosecuting him, and\r\nGrosero appeals to the Suprema to intervene and put an end to such\r\nviolations of the immunity necessary to enable the Inquisition to\r\nperform its pious work.[74] It is not likely that the Suprema succeeded\r\nin establishing concord between the irreconcilable pretensions of the\r\ntwo ecclesiastical bodies, but the struggle is worth passing attention\r\nas affording a glimpse into the social conditions of the period under\r\nsuch institutions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the incessant bickering with the civil authorities continued\r\nas active and as bitter as ever. No attention was paid to the\r\nlimitations prescribed in the Concordias, or to the protests of the\r\nviceroys until, in 1635, an attempt was made, in a new Concordia, to\r\nremedy some of the more crying evils by empowering the viceroy, in cases\r\nof exceptional gravity, to banish criminal officials, after notice to\r\nthe senior inquisitor, so that he might appeal to Madrid, and in these\r\ncases the inquisitors were forbidden to excommunicate the officers of\r\njustice.[75] Slender as was this concession, the inquisitors, in a\r\nletter of April 26, 1652, to the Suprema, did not hesitate to assert\r\nthat the exemptions of the officials were reduced to those of the vilest\r\nplebeians and that their revenue suffered heavily through the\r\nlimitation of their jurisdiction and the great reduction in the number\r\nof those who applied for appointments.[76] On the other hand, if we may\r\nbelieve the _Consulta Magna_, drawn up, in 1696, by a special junta\r\ncomposed of representatives of all the royal councils except the\r\nSuprema, the Sicilian tribunal paid no respect whatever to the\r\nConcordias, held itself as wholly independent of all rules and enforced\r\nits arbitrary acts by the constant abuse of excommunication, which\r\nrendered the condition of the island most deplorable. The inquisitors\r\nrefused to meet the judges in competencias on disputed cases and though,\r\nby the Concordia of 1635, such refusal incurred a fine of five hundred\r\nducats for a first offence and dismissal for a second, yet as the\r\nenforcement of this required the issue by the Suprema of a commission to\r\nthe Council of Italy, it was easily eluded. As a matter of course the\r\nsuggestion of the junta was ineffective that those oppressed by the\r\nabuse of spiritual censures should have the right of appeal to the royal\r\njudges.[77]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThese quarrels and the exercise of its widely extended temporal\r\njurisdiction by no means distracted wholly the tribunal from its\r\nlegitimate functions of preserving the purity of the faith. In 1640 it\r\nheld a notable auto de fe in which one case is worth alluding to as an\r\nillustration of inquisitorial dealings with the insane. Carlo Tabaloro\r\nof Calabria was an Augustinian lay-brother, who had conceived the idea\r\nthat he was the Son of God and the Messiah, Christ having been merely\r\nthe Redeemer. He had written a gospel about himself and framed a series\r\nof novel religious observances. Arrested by the Palermo tribunal, in\r\n1635, he had imagined it to be for the purpose of enabling him to\r\nconvert the inquisitors and through them the people. For five years the\r\ntheologians labored to disabuse him, but to no purpose; he was condemned\r\nas an obstinate and pertinacious heretic and was led forth in the auto\r\nof 1640 to be burnt alive. On his way to the stake he still expected\r\nthat torrents of rain would extinguish the fires, but finding himself\r\ndisappointed and shrinking from the awful death, at the last moment he\r\nprofessed conversion and was mercifully strangled before the pile was\r\nlighted.[78] At another auto, June 2, 1647, there were thirty-four\r\npenitents and six months later another, January 12, 1648, with\r\nthirty-seven, followed, December 13th of the same year, by one with\r\nforty-three. January 22, 1651, there was another with thirty-nine,\r\nhonored moreover with the presence of Don John of Austria, fresh from\r\nthe triumph of suppressing the Neapolitan revolt of Masaniello. In fact,\r\nin a letter of April 26, 1652, the inquisitors boasted that they had\r\npunished two hundred and seven culprits in public autos, besides nearly\r\nas many who had been despatched privately in the audience chamber. This\r\nwould show an average of about eighty cases a year, greatly more than at\r\nthis time was customary in Spain. The offences were mostly blasphemy,\r\nbigamy and sorcery, with an occasional Protestant or Alumbrado, the\r\nJudaizers by this time having almost disappeared.[79] The position of\r\ninquisitor was not wholly without danger, for Juan López de Cisneros\r\ndied of a wound in the forehead inflicted by Fray Diego la Mattina, a\r\nprisoner whom he was visiting in his cell and who was burnt alive in the\r\nauto of March 17, 1658.[80] The activity of the tribunal must at times\r\nhave brought in considerable profits for, in 1640, we happen to learn\r\nthat it was contributing yearly twenty-four thousand reales in silver to\r\nthe Suprema and not long afterwards it was called upon to send five\r\nhundred ducats, _plata doble_, to that of Majorca, which had been\r\nimpoverished by a pestilence. Still these gains were fluctuating and the\r\ndemands on the tribunal seem to have brought it into financial straits,\r\nfrom which the Suprema sought to relieve it by an appeal, August 6,\r\n1652, to Philip IV, to grant it benefices to the amount of twenty-five\r\nhundred ducats a year.[81]\r\n\r\nThe treaty of Utrecht, in 1713, gave Sicily to Savoy, but the\r\nInquisition remained Spanish and nominally subject to the Suprema. There\r\nwas, however, an immediate change of personnel, for we find the\r\ninquisitor, José de la Rosa Cozio, early in 1714, taking refuge in Spain\r\nand billeted upon the tribunal of Valencia.[82] When, in 1718, Savoy\r\nexchanged Sicily with Austria for Sardinia, the Emperor Charles VI would\r\nnot endure this dependence of the tribunal upon a foreign power and\r\nprocured, in 1720, from Clement XI a brief transferring the supremacy to\r\nVienna. In accordance, however, with the persistent Hapsburg claims on\r\nthe crown of Spain, the Inquisition remained Spanish. A supreme council\r\nfor it was created in Vienna, with Juan Navarro, Bishop of Albarracin as\r\nchief who, although resident there gratified himself with the title of\r\n_Inquisidor-general de España_, but in 1723 he was succeeded by Cardinal\r\nEmeric, Archbishop of Kolocz. Apparently it was deemed necessary to\r\njustify this elaborate machinery with a demonstration and, on April 6,\r\n1724, an auto de fe was celebrated at Palermo with great splendor, the\r\nexpenses being defrayed by the emperor. Twenty-six delinquents were\r\npenanced, consisting as usual mostly of cases of blasphemy, bigamy and\r\nsorcery, but the spectacle would have been incomplete without\r\nconcremation and two unfortunates, who had languished in prison since\r\n1699, were brought out for that purpose. They were Geltruda, a beguine,\r\nand Fra Romualdo, a friar, accused of Quietism and Molinism, with the\r\naccompanying heresies of illuminism and impeccability. Their long\r\nimprisonment, with torture and ill-usage, seems to have turned their\r\nbrains, and they had been condemned to relaxation as impenitent in 1705\r\nand 1709, but the sentences had never been carried out and they were now\r\nbrought from their dungeons and burnt alive.[83] Less notable was an\r\nauto de fe of March 22, 1732, in which Antonio Canzoneri was burnt alive\r\nas a contumacious and relapsed heretic.[84]\r\n\r\nAlthough the zeal of Charles VI led to increased activity of the\r\ntribunal in matters of faith, he was little disposed to tolerate its\r\nabuse of its temporal jurisdiction, which had led to so many fruitless\r\nremonstrances under Spanish domination. In letters of January 26, 1729,\r\nto his viceroy the Count of Sástago, he recites the complaints made to\r\nhim, by the English factory, that foreign merchants were exposed to\r\nconstant frauds by bankruptcies of debtors who claimed the forum of the\r\nInquisition or of the Santa Cruzada, where creditors could get no\r\njustice or even ascertain whether the bankruptcies were fictitious or\r\nnot. The emperor therefore orders that in future the Concordias shall be\r\nstrictly construed and rigidly adhered to; that if the inquisitors\r\nproceed by excommunication they shall experience the effect of “los\r\nremedios económicos” (presumably the suspension of their emoluments) and\r\nthat in future all mercantile cases, whether civil or criminal, shall\r\nnot be entitled to the forum of the Inquisition--all of which was duly\r\nproclaimed by the viceroy in an edict of March 17th. At the same time\r\nthe legal functionaries were required to investigate the whole subject\r\nand report what further measures might be essential to prevent\r\ninterference with the course of justice. The result of their labors is\r\nembodied in a Pragmatic Sanction of May 12, 1732, consisting of eleven\r\narticles, whereby it was ordered that the inquisitorial forum should not\r\ninclude exemption from military service and taxes; that widows of\r\nstipendiary officials should enjoy the forum only during widowhood; that\r\nthe privilege of bearing arms should be exercised only when in actual\r\nservice of the Inquisition; that commissions as messengers should not be\r\ngiven to shipmasters; nobles holding fiefs were not to be enrolled as\r\nfamiliars; the forum was not to exempt from serving in onerous public\r\noffice and the use of excommunication in cases of impeding jurisdiction\r\nwas allowed under certain limitations. This latter is explained by a\r\ndecision of March 6, 1734, on cases in which the inquisitors had\r\nexcommunicated D. Antonio Crimibela, a judge of the Gran Corte and D.\r\nFelipe Venuto, _capitan de justicia_ of Paternò, when it was ordered\r\nthat excommunications could only be employed in matters of faith and in\r\ncases where the secular tribunals had refused the conference preliminary\r\nto forming a competencia to decide as to the jurisdiction.[85]\r\n\r\nThe conquest of the Two Sicilies by Charles III, in 1734, led the\r\ninquisitors to imagine that, under a Spanish dynasty, they could\r\nreassert their superiority over the law, but they were promptly\r\nundeceived. D. Sisto Poidimani, when on trial, recused them for enmity\r\nas judges in his case and the Giunta of Presidents recognized his\r\nreasons as sufficient, whereupon Viceroy de Castro ordered them, October\r\n2, 1735, to take no further action except to appoint some one to act in\r\ntheir place. To this they demurred and de Castro repeated the order,\r\nJanuary 24, 1736, and again on February 19th. Finally, on April 21st he\r\ntold them that they were actuated, not by reason but by disobedience,\r\nand that, if the order was not promptly obeyed, the senior inquisitor\r\nmust sail, within forty-eight hours, for Naples to render to the king an\r\naccount of his actions.[86]\r\n\r\nThe various changes that had occurred rendered the position of the\r\nSicilian tribunal somewhat anomalous and to remedy this the king\r\nobtained, in 1738, from Clement XIII the appointment of Pietro Galletti,\r\nBishop of Catania, as inquisitor-general of Sicily, with power to\r\ndeputize subordinates, who was followed, in 1742, by Giacomo Bonanno,\r\nBishop of Patti, appointed by Benedict XIV.[87] Thus the severance from\r\nSpain was perpetuated and it was rendered independent. This seems to\r\nhave revived its aggressiveness and it assumed that the limitations\r\nimposed by the Emperor Charles VI had become obsolete with the change of\r\nsovereigns for, in 1739, it endeavored to intervene in the bankruptcy\r\ncase of Giuseppe Maria Gerardi, who was entitled to its forum, but the\r\nattempt was promptly annulled by the Viceroy Corsini. A further blow was\r\ninflicted by a decree of July 12, 1746, suppressing the system of\r\ncompetencias, for the settlement of conflicting cases of jurisdiction,\r\nand substituting, in all cases not of faith, the decision of the\r\nviceroy, who could, in matters of grave importance, refer them to the\r\nking.[88] Thus gradually the secular business of the Holy Office was\r\ncircumscribed; in its spiritual field of activity there were no more\r\nburnings, though it occasionally held autos de fe, in which figured\r\nmostly women accused of the vulgar arts of sorcery, and in addition it\r\ninterfered with scholars in its capacity of censor.\r\n\r\nThe enlightened views of Charles III were not abandoned, when he was\r\nsummoned to the throne of Spain in 1759, and left that of Naples to his\r\nyoung son, Ferdinando IV, then a child eight years of age. Public\r\nopinion in Italy was rapidly rendering the Holy Office an anachronism\r\nand Ferdinando only expressed the general sentiment when, by a decree of\r\nMarch 16, 1782, he pronounced its suppression. He gave as a reason that\r\nall attempts had failed to make it alter its vicious system, which\r\ndeprived the accused of legitimate means of defence; he restored to the\r\nbishops their original jurisdiction in all matters of faith, but\r\nrequired them to observe the same procedure as the secular courts of\r\njustice and to submit to the viceroy for approval all citations to\r\nappear, all orders for arrest and all sentences proposed; moreover, he\r\nappropriated the property of the Inquisition to continuing for life the\r\nsalaries of the officials, with a provision that, as these pensions\r\nshould fall in, the money should be used for the public benefit. The\r\nrevenues, in fact, amounted to ten thousand crowns a year and eventually\r\nthey served to found chairs in mathematics and experimental physics and\r\nto build an observatory. When the royal officials took possession of the\r\nInquisition, they found only three prisoners to liberate--women accused\r\nof witchcraft. A few more had previously been discharged, in\r\nanticipation of the suppression, by the inquisitor-general, Salvatore\r\nVentimiglia, Archbishop of Nicodemia.[89]\r\n\r\nIn its career, since 1487, Franchina, writing in 1744, boasts that the\r\nHoly Office had handed over to the secular arm for burning two hundred\r\nand one living heretics and apostates and two hundred and seventy-nine\r\neffigies of the dead or fugitives.[90] It illustrates forcibly the\r\nchanged spirit of the age that Viceroy Caraccioli, in writing to\r\nD’Alembert an account of the abolition, says that he shed tears of joy\r\nin proceeding to the Inquisition with the great dignitaries of State and\r\nChurch, when he caused the royal rescript to be read to the inquisitor\r\nand the arms of the Holy Office to be erased from the portal amid the\r\nrejoicing of the assembled people.[91]\r\n\r\n\r\nMALTA.\r\n\r\n\r\nMalta, if we may believe Salelles, enjoyed the honor of having St. Paul\r\nas the founder of its Inquisition, when he was cast ashore there on his\r\nvoyage to Rome.[92] In the sixteenth century, however, as a dependency\r\nof Sicily, it was under the Sicilian tribunal, which maintained an\r\norganization there, under a commissioner.[93] When, in 1530, Charles V\r\ngave the island to the Knights of St. John, the Sicilian jurisdiction\r\nlapsed but, even without the Holy Office, the Church had efficient\r\nmachinery for the suppression of heresy. In 1546 a Frenchman named\r\nGesuald was found to have been for ten years infecting the islanders\r\nwith Calvinist opinions, and the Aragonese Domingo Cubelles, the Bishop\r\nof Malta, was at no loss in exercising his episcopal jurisdiction.\r\nGesuald was obstinate in his faith and was duly burnt alive; on his way\r\nto the stake he called out “Why do priests hesitate to take wives, since\r\nit is lawful?” whereupon Cubelles ordered him to be gagged and he\r\nperished in silence. His converts lacked his stubborn convictions and\r\nwere reconciled--among them two priests who had secretly married their\r\nconcubines, for which they were condemned to wear the sanbenito. In\r\n1553, the Grand Master, Juan de Omedes, constituted three of the knights\r\nand a chaplain as an Inquisition, but there is no trace of their labors\r\nand Cubelles continued to exercise his episcopal jurisdiction in several\r\ncases during the following years. In 1560, however, when a Maltese,\r\nnamed Doctor Pietro Combo, fell under suspicion, Cubelles seems to have\r\nfelt uncertain what to do with him and sent him in chains to the Roman\r\nInquisition, where he was acquitted. Cubelles informed the cardinals\r\nthat the Lutheran heresy was spreading in the island and this probably\r\nexplains why, by letters of October 21, 1561, the Roman Inquisition,\r\nwhile recognizing the episcopal jurisdiction of Cubelles, enlarged it to\r\nthat of an inquisitor-general, empowering him to appoint deputies and to\r\nproceed against all persons, whether clerics or laymen, to try them,\r\ntorture them, relax them or reconcile them with appropriate penance.[94]\r\n\r\nIn his zeal for the effective discharge of his duties, Cubelles sent to\r\nPalermo for detailed information as to the conduct of the Inquisition\r\nand was furnished with copies of the Spanish instructions and forms.\r\nThis seems to have provoked the Roman Congregation of the Holy Office,\r\nbetween which and the Spanish there was perpetual jealousy, and it sent\r\nto Malta a Dominican to act as his assistant and to direct him. He was\r\nsucceeded, both as bishop and inquisitor, by Martin Rojas de Portorubio,\r\nto whom in 1573 Gregory XIII sent a commission. Apparently it was\r\nimpossible for the Inquisition to maintain harmonious relations with the\r\ntemporal power and, already in 1574, he complained to Rome that his\r\nofficials were beaten and that the Grand Master, Jean l’Evesque de la\r\nCassière, threatened to throw him out of the window if he came to the\r\npalace. This created considerable scandal, but Rome, unlike Spain, was\r\nnot accustomed to support inquisitors through thick and thin, and the\r\nresult was that, by brief of July 3, 1574, Gregory revoked his\r\ncommission and sent Dr. Pietro Duzzina as apostolic vicar to conduct the\r\nInquisition. In thus separating it from the episcopate no provision was\r\nmade for its expenses, but soon after this the confiscated property of\r\nMathieu Faison, a rich heretic burnt in effigy, yielded a revenue of\r\nthree hundred crowns and, when Bishop Rojas died, March 19, 1577,\r\nopportunity was taken to burden the see with a pension of six hundred\r\nmore for its benefit.[95] It was thus rendered permanent, but a\r\nprotracted struggle with successive grandmasters was necessary to secure\r\nfor its officials the privileges of the forum and the immunities and\r\nexemptions which they claimed.[96]\r\n\r\nYet the Spanish Inquisition was not satisfied to be thus completely\r\nsuperseded by that of Rome, even in so remote and inconspicuous a spot\r\nas Malta. In 1575 Duzzina arrested a man as a heretic; it was known that\r\ntestimony against him had been taken in Sicily and application for it\r\nwas made to the inquisitors of Palermo. They applied for instructions to\r\nthe Suprema, which ordered them not to give it but to claim the\r\nprisoner. The result was that the Maltese tribunal tried him on what had\r\noccurred on the island and discharged him.[97] This emphasized its\r\nabsolute separation from the Spanish Holy Office and its history need\r\nnot be further followed here, except to allude to the most celebrated\r\ncase in its annals, when the two Quakeresses, Katharine Evans and Sarah\r\nCheevers, moved by the Spirit, went to Malta on a mission of conversion\r\nand suffered an imprisonment of four years.[98]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nNAPLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Naples the Inquisition had been introduced by Charles of Anjou after\r\nthe battle of Benevento had acquired for him the succession to the\r\nunfortunate Manfred. The house of Aragon, which followed that of Anjou,\r\nhad permitted its existence, but under conditions of such subjection to\r\nthe crown that it was for the most part inert. Yet Naples offered an\r\nabundant harvest for the zealous laborer. The Waldenses from Savoy, who\r\nhad settled and multiplied in Calabria and Apulia, had obtained, in\r\n1497, from King Frederic, a confirmation of their agreements with their\r\nimmediate suzerains, the nobles, and felt secure from persecution.[99]\r\nStill more inviting were the banished Jews and fugitive New Christians\r\nfrom Spain, who found there a tolerably safe refuge. There was also a\r\nconsiderable number of indigenous Jews. In the twelfth century Benjamin\r\nof Tudela describes flourishing synagogues in Capua, Naples, Salerno,\r\nAmalfi, Benevento, Melfi, Ascoli-Satriano, Tarento, Bernaldo and\r\nOtranto, and these doubtless were representatives of others existing\r\noutside of the line of his wanderings.[100] They had probably gone on\r\nincreasing, although, in 1427, Joanna II called in the ruthless St.\r\nGiovanni da Capistrano to suppress their usury and, in 1447, Nicholas V\r\nappointed him conservator to enforce the disabilities and humiliations\r\nprescribed in a cruel bull which he had just issued.[101] Possibly,\r\nunder this rigorous treatment, some of them may have sought baptism for,\r\nin 1449, we find Nicholas despatching to Naples Fra Matteo da Reggio as\r\ninquisitor to exterminate the apostate Judaizers, who were said to be\r\nnumerous.[102] If we may believe Zurita, when Charles VIII of France\r\nmade his transitory conquest of Naples, in 1495, the Jews were all\r\ncompulsorily baptized, with the usual result that their Christianity was\r\nonly nominal.[103] Such unwilling converts of course called for\r\ninquisitorial solicitude but, when Ferdinand of Spain obtained\r\npossession of the land, it was the fugitives from the Spanish\r\nInquisition that rendered him especially desirous of extending its\r\njurisdiction over his dominions on the Italian mainland.\r\n\r\nA single example will illustrate this and also throw light on the\r\nresistance which, as we shall see, the Neapolitans offered to the\r\nintroduction of the Holy Office after the Spanish pattern. In the\r\ninquisitorial documents of the period, no name occurs more frequently\r\nthan that of Manuel Esparza de Pantolosa, who was condemned _in\r\nabsentia_ as a heretic, in Tarragona. He had evidently sought safety in\r\nflight, abandoning his property which was confiscated and sold, June 4,\r\n1493, for 9000 libras to his brother, Micer Luis Esparza, a jurist of\r\nValencia, whose final payment for it is dated February 2, 1499, when the\r\ninquisitor, Juan de Monasterio, was authorized to retain a hundred\r\nducats in reward for his labors.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Pantolosa had prospered in Naples as a banker and had become\r\none of the farmers of the revenue. As a condemned heretic, however, all\r\ndealings with him were unlawful to Spaniards. It was difficult to avoid\r\nthese in transactions between Spain and Naples and, in February, 1499,\r\nthe inquisitors of Barcelona created much scandal by arresting a number\r\nof merchants for maintaining business relations with him, an excess of\r\nzeal for which Ferdinand scolded them, while ordering the release of the\r\nprisoners. Pantolosa seems to have held out some hopes of returning and\r\nstanding trial, for a safe-conduct was issued to him, October 4, 1499,\r\ngood for twelve months, during which he and his property were to be\r\nexempt from seizure, dealings with him were permitted and ship-masters\r\nwere authorized to transport him and, on the plea that he had been\r\nimpeded, the safe-conduct was extended, August 22, 1500, for two years.\r\nThere was manifest policy in suspending the customary disabilities for a\r\npersonage of such importance, as appears from one or two instances.\r\nWhen, in the autumn of 1499, Ferdinand’s sister, Juana, Queen of Naples,\r\nand her stepson, the Cardinal of Aragon, came to Spain, they provided\r\nthemselves with bills of exchange drawn by the farmers of\r\nrevenue--Pantolosa, Gaspar de Caballería and others--on Luis de\r\nSantangel, Ferdinand’s _escribano de racion_, or privy purse. They could\r\nnot anticipate any trouble in a transaction between officials of Spain\r\nand Naples, but Santangel, also a Converso, had reason to be cautious as\r\nto his relations with the Inquisition and he refused to honor the bills,\r\nbecause the drawers were fugitive condemned heretics, with whom he could\r\nhave no dealings. Ferdinand was obliged to confer with the\r\ninquisitors-general, after which he authorized Santangel to supply the\r\nnecessities of the royal visitors. Possibly in this case the association\r\nwith Caballería neutralized Pantolosa’s safe-conduct, but this\r\ndisturbing element was absent from a flagrant exhibition of\r\ninquisitorial audacity when, in 1500, Ferdinand sent the Archbishop of\r\nTarragona to Naples on business connected with his sister, the queen.\r\nRequiring money while there the archbishop sold bills of exchange to\r\nPantolosa and, when they were presented in Tarragona, the inquisitors,\r\napparently regarding them as a debt due to a condemned heretic, forbade\r\ntheir payment and sequestrated the archiepiscopal revenues to collect\r\nthe amount. The bills were returned and were sent back with a fresh\r\ndemand for payment, when Ferdinand intervened and, by letters of July\r\n3d, ordered the inquisitors to remove the sequestration so that they\r\ncould be paid and the archbishop’s credit be preserved.[104] It is easy\r\nto understand how Ferdinand felt towards the Neapolitan asylum for\r\ncondemned Spanish heretics and banished Jews and how Naples regarded the\r\narbitrary processes of the Spanish Holy Office.\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1500, Ferdinand had seized Calabria and Apulia, in fulfilment\r\nof the robber bargain between him and Louis XII, he lost little time in\r\nturning to account his new acquisition for the benefit of the Sicilian\r\nHoly Office. A letter of August 7, 1501, to his representatives recites\r\nthat the inquisitors of Sicily say that they will be aided in their work\r\nby the testimony of the New Christians of Calabria, wherefore all whom\r\nthey may designate are to be compelled to give the evidence\r\nrequired.[105] When, in 1503, Ferdinand obtained the whole kingdom by\r\nousting his accomplice Louis, Gonsalvo de Córdova, to facilitate the\r\nsurrender of Naples, made an engagement that the Spanish Inquisition\r\nshould not be introduced, for its evil reputation rendered it a\r\nuniversal object of dread, to which the numerous Spanish refugees had\r\ndoubtless largely contributed.[106] The Neapolitans also desired to\r\ndestroy the principal incentive of the existing Inquisition by a\r\ncondition that confiscation should be restricted to cases of high\r\ntreason, but this they were unable to secure and the final articles\r\nallowed its use in heresy and treason.[107] Ferdinand’s order of August,\r\n1501, as to obtaining evidence for Sicily, seems to have met with slack\r\nobedience, for there is a letter of November 16, 1504, from Gonsalvo to\r\nthe royal officials in general, reciting that Archbishop Belorado, as\r\nInquisitor of Sicily, had sent to Reggio, to obtain certain necessary\r\ndepositions, but that the officials had prevented it, wherefore he\r\nreminds them of the royal commands and imposes a penalty of a thousand\r\nducats for all future cases of disobedience.[108]\r\n\r\nNo sooner was the conquest of Naples assured than Ferdinand proceeded to\r\nclear the land of Judaism by ordering Gonsalvo to banish all the Jews.\r\nThe persecution at the time of Charles VIII had left few of them _de\r\nseñal_--those who openly avowed their faith by wearing the prescribed\r\nletter Tau--and Gonsalvo seems to have reported that prosecution of the\r\nsecret apostates was the only method practicable. Julius II opportunely\r\nset the example by instituting a severe inquisition, under the Dominican\r\norganization at Benevento.[109] Ferdinand regarded with extreme jealousy\r\nall exercise of papal jurisdiction within his dominions and to prevent\r\nthe extension of this he naturally had recourse to the commission of his\r\ninquisitor-general which covered all the territories of the Spanish\r\ncrown. A secret letter was drawn up, June 30, 1504, by Ferdinand and\r\nIsabella, in conjunction with the Suprema, or Supreme Council of the\r\nInquisition, addressed to all the royal officials in Naples, reciting\r\nthat as numerous heretics duly burnt in effigy in Spain had found\r\nrefuge there, the Inquisitor-general Deza had resolved to extend over\r\nthe kingdom the jurisdiction of Archbishop Belorado, Inquisitor of\r\nSicily, and had asked the sovereigns to support him in his labors of\r\narresting and punishing heretics and confiscating their property. All\r\nofficials were therefore ordered, under pain of ten thousand ounces, to\r\nprotect him and his subordinates and to do their bidding as to\r\narresting, transporting and punishing the guilty, all oaths and compacts\r\nto the contrary notwithstanding. At the same time a personal letter to\r\nGonsalvo expressed the determination of the sovereigns to introduce the\r\nInquisition, their founding of which they believed to be the cause why\r\nGod had favored them with victories and benefits. Gonsalvo was warned\r\nnot to allow the suspect to leave the kingdom while, to avoid arousing\r\nsuspicion, Belorado would come to Naples as though on his way to Rome\r\nand Gonsalvo was to guard all ports and passes through which the\r\nheretics could escape. To prepare for the expected confiscations, the\r\ncommission of Diego de Obregon, receiver of Sicily, was extended over\r\nNaples and Francisco de Rojas, then ambassador at Rome, was instructed\r\nto obtain from the pope whatever was necessary to perfect the functions\r\nof the Neapolitan Holy Office.[110]\r\n\r\nEverything thus was prepared for the organization of the Spanish\r\nInquisition in Naples, but even Ferdinand’s resolute will was forced to\r\nabandon for the time the projected enterprise with its prospective\r\nprofits. What occurred we do not know; the historian, to whom we are\r\nindebted for the documents in the matter, merely says that Ferdinand, in\r\nspite of his efforts, was prevented from carrying out his plans by\r\ndifficulties which arose.[111] We can conjecture however that Gonsalvo\r\nconvinced him of the impolicy of provoking a revolt in his newly\r\nacquired and as yet unstable dominions. The Neapolitans were somewhat\r\nnoted for turbulence and had an organization which afforded a means of\r\nexpressing and executing the popular will. From of old the citizens were\r\ndivided into six associations, known as _Piazze_ or _Seggi_, in which\r\nthey met to discuss public affairs. Of these five, designated as\r\nCapuana, Nido, Porta, Porta nueva and Montagna, were formed of the\r\nnobles and the sixth was the Seggio del Popolo, divided into twenty-nine\r\ndistricts, called Ottine. Each piazza elected a chief, known as the\r\n_Eletto_, and these six, when assembled together, formed the Tribunale\r\ndi San Lorenzo, which thus represented the whole population. There were\r\nPiazze in other cities but when, under Charles V, the national\r\nParliament was discontinued, the Piazze of Naples arrogated to\r\nthemselves its powers and framed legislation for the whole kingdom. A\r\nSpanish writer, in 1691, informs us that no viceroy could govern\r\nsuccessfully who had not dexterity to secure the favor of a majority of\r\nthe Piazze, for the people were obstinate and tempestuous, easy to\r\nexcite and difficult to pacify, and, if the nobles and people were\r\nunited, God alone could find a remedy to quiet them.[112] In the\r\nunsettled condition of Italian affairs, to provoke revolt in such a\r\ncommunity was evidently most unwise; there is no appearance that\r\nBelorado made his threatened visit, and when Ferdinand himself came to\r\nNaples, in 1506 and 1507, he seems to have tacitly acquiesced in the\r\npostponement of his purpose.\r\n\r\nThe popular repugnance was wholly directed to the Spanish Inquisition\r\nand there was no objection to the papal institution, which had long been\r\na matter accepted. In 1505 a letter of Gonsalvo directs the arrest in\r\nManfredonia of three fugitives from Benevento, who are seeking to escape\r\nto Turkey; he does this, he says, at the request of the inquisitor and\r\nof the Bishop of Bertinoro papal commissioner.[113] Evidently there must\r\nhave been active persecution on foot in Benevento and, though the\r\ninquisitor is not named, he was probably the Dominican Barnaba\r\nCapograsso, whom we find, in 1506, styled “generale inquisitore de la\r\nfede” when, in conjunction with the vicar-general of the archbishop and\r\nthe judges of the vicariate, he burned three women for witchcraft.[114]\r\nYet anxious as was Ferdinand for the extirpation of heresy, he would not\r\nabate a jot of the royal supremacy and would allow no one to exercise\r\ninquisitorial functions without his licence. The correspondence of the\r\nCount of Ribagorza, who succeeded Gonsalvo as lieutenant-general and\r\nviceroy during the years 1507, 1508, and 1509, shows that Fra Barnaba\r\nheld a commission directly from the king. When a certain Fra Vincenzo da\r\nFernandina endeavored in Barletta to conduct an inquisition, Ribagorza\r\nexpressed surprise at his audacity in doing so without exhibiting his\r\ncommission; he was summoned to come forthwith and submit it so that due\r\naction could be taken without exposing him to ignominy. So minute was\r\nthis supervision that, when Fra Barnaba reported that a colleague had\r\nreceived a papal brief respecting a certain Lorenzo da Scala, addressed\r\nto the two inquisitors and the Bishop of Scala, Ribagorza ordered it to\r\nbe surrendered unopened to the regent of the royal chancery and that all\r\nthree addressees should come to Naples when, in their presence and his,\r\nit should be opened and the necessary action be ordered. From a letter\r\nof February 24, 1508, it appears that the old Neapolitan rule was\r\nmaintained and that inquisitors had no power to order arrests, but had\r\nto report to Ribagorza, who issued the necessary instructions to the\r\nofficials; indeed, a commission of January 14, 1509, indicates that\r\nheretics were seized and brought to Naples before the viceroy, without\r\nthe intervention of the Holy Office. At the same time, when inquisitors\r\nwere duly commissioned and recognized, the authorities were required to\r\nrender them all needful assistance and any impediment thrown in their\r\nway was severely reproved, with threats of condign punishment.[115]\r\n\r\nThus quietly and by degrees the old papal Inquisition was roused into\r\nactivity and was moulded into an instrument controlled by the royal\r\npower even more directly than in Spain. Yet this did not satisfy\r\nFerdinand, who had never abandoned his intention of introducing the\r\nSpanish Inquisition, and apparently he thought, in 1509, that the\r\nNeapolitans had become sufficiently accustomed to his rule to endure\r\nthe innovation. Rumors of his purpose spread, causing popular agitation,\r\nand Julius II, who wanted his aid against the French in Northern Italy,\r\nearnestly deprecated action which might necessitate the recall of his\r\ntroops to put down insurrection. To the Spanish ambassador the pope\r\nrepresented the danger of exciting the turbulent population; the time\r\nwould come when the Spanish Inquisition might safely be imposed on\r\nNaples, but so long as the French were in possession of Genoa, the king\r\nmust be cautious.[116]\r\n\r\nFerdinand was not to be diverted from his course by such considerations\r\nand, on August 31, 1509, a series of letters was addressed to Naples\r\nshowing that the organization had been fully and elaborately prepared.\r\nMontoro, Bishop of Cefalù, whose acquaintance we have made in Sicily,\r\nand Doctor Andrés de Palacios, a layman and experienced inquisitor, were\r\nappointed to conduct the office, with a full complement of subordinates,\r\nwhose liberal salaries were to be paid out of the confiscations, showing\r\nthat a plentiful harvest was expected.[117] Viceroy Ribagorza and all\r\nroyal officials and ecclesiastics were instructed to give them all\r\nnecessary support and assistance under penalty of ten thousand ounces\r\nand punishment at the royal pleasure, notwithstanding any previous\r\ncompacts or conventions, for agreements contrary to the faith were not\r\nto be observed by Catholics. On arrival they were to be established in\r\nthe Incoronata or, if they preferred other quarters, the occupants\r\nwere to be summarily ejected and a proper rent be paid. The\r\nCardinal-archbishop of Naples was ordered to give them powers to act as\r\nhis ordinaries and vicars; a pragmatic sanction was drawn up for\r\npublication, forbidding, under heavy penalties, the use of any papal\r\nletters of absolution until they should have received the royal assent.\r\nThe local officials were also written to, ordering them to aid the\r\ninquisitors in every way and a circular to the same effect was sent to\r\nall the barons of the kingdom. As it was expected that, as soon as the\r\nletters were published, the heretics would endeavor to escape, the\r\nviceroy was ordered to take measures that none should be allowed to\r\nembark, or to send away property or merchandise, and all who should\r\nattempt it were to be delivered forthwith to the inquisitors.[118]\r\nEvidently the matter had been thoroughly worked out in detail and\r\nFerdinand was resolved to enforce his will. Then followed, however, an\r\nunexpected delay. Ribagorza left Naples, October 8th, probably resigning\r\nor being removed owing to his conviction of the difficulty of the task\r\nimposed on him, and his successor, Ramon de Cardona, did not arrive\r\nuntil October 23d, showing that the change was sudden and unexpected.\r\nThe Bishop of Cefalù, also, did not reach Naples until October 18th and,\r\nalthough officially received, he exhibited no commission as inquisitor\r\nand took no action, awaiting his colleague Palacios, whose coming was\r\ndelayed until December 29th.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile rumors of what was proposed had been spreading, popular\r\nexcitement had been growing and it now became uncontrollable. It was\r\nopenly declared by all classes that the Inquisition would not be\r\ntolerated and, when it was reported that, on a certain Sunday, the\r\ninquisitor would preach the customary sermon in the cathedral, an\r\nunanimous resolution was adopted, January 4, 1510, that such an attempt\r\nwould be resisted, if necessary by force of arms. A delegation, selected\r\nas usual by all the Piazze, was sent to the viceroy and overwhelmed him\r\nwith fierce denunciations of the detested institution as developed in\r\nSpain--the tortures and the burnings inflicted for the most trivial\r\ncauses, the sentences against the dead and the burning of bones, the\r\nexecution of pregnant women, the disinheriting of children, the\r\nscourging of naked virgins through the streets and the seizure of their\r\ndowries, the innocent impelled to flight by terror and consequently\r\ncondemned in order to confiscate their property, while their servants\r\nwere tortured to find out whether anything was concealed, and the\r\nstories of sacrilege invented in order to gratify rapacity. Although\r\nmost of this was the ordinary inquisitorial practice, it was\r\nsufficiently embellished to show that the refugee New Christians had\r\nbeen busy in fanning the excitement which now burst upon the viceroy.\r\nEvery delegate sought to outdo his colleagues in vociferously\r\nenumerating the horrors which justified the evil reputation of the\r\ndreaded institution, and the viceroy was told that they never would\r\nallow themselves to be subjected to the accusations of informers, whose\r\nnames were concealed and whose perjuries were stimulated by a share in\r\nthe spoils; the whole business was not to protect religion but to get\r\nmoney and they would not be dishonored and put to death and despoiled as\r\ninfidels under such pretexts. If he valued the peace of the realm, he\r\nwould prohibit the sermon. Cardona listened to the storm of objurgation\r\nand, when it had exhausted itself, he replied that he had the king’s\r\norders to receive the inquisitors and would obey them. This aroused a\r\ngreater uproar than before and he weakened under it. He retired to\r\nconsult the council and on his return he told the deputies that they\r\nmight send envoys to the king to expound their views and learn his\r\ndecision; meanwhile he would prevent the inquisitors from acting and\r\nthey must preserve the peace.\r\n\r\nThe agitation continued; daily assemblies were held in the Seggi and,\r\non January 9th and 10th, a formal agreement was drawn up and executed\r\nbetween the nobles and the people, in which they bound themselves to\r\nsacrifice life and property sooner than to permit the introduction of\r\nthe Inquisition and, at the same time, they elected Francesco Filomarino\r\nas envoy to Ferdinand. The next day a trivial occurrence nearly produced\r\na serious outbreak, showing how dangerous was the tension of popular\r\nfeeling. Luca Russo, who was one of the most active agitators, had an\r\nold quarrel, arising from a lawsuit, with Roberto Bonifacio, the\r\njusticiary of the city; he chanced to meet Colantonio Sanguigno, a\r\nretainer of Bonifacio; words passed between them and Sanguigno made a\r\nhostile demonstration, which started a rumor that Russo was slain. The\r\nshops forthwith were closed, the populace rushed to arms, shouting\r\n_ferro, ferro! serra, serra!_ and the house of the justiciary was\r\nbesieged by an enormous mob thirsting for his blood, but on the\r\nproduction of the supposed victim they quietly dispersed. During all\r\nthis we hear nothing of the Bishop of Cefalù, but his colleague, Andrés\r\nPalacios, was expelled from one domicile after another; he was a\r\ndangerous inmate and finally found refuge in the palace of the Admiral\r\nof Naples, Villamari, Count of Capaccio, where he lay in retirement for\r\nsome months.\r\n\r\nFilomarino, the envoy to Ferdinand, did not start for Spain until April\r\nand the reports received from him during the summer were such that the\r\npeople lost hope of a peaceful solution. Yet during the whole of this\r\nanxious time, although the kingdom everywhere was united in support of\r\nthe capital, though all the troops in the land had been sent to the wars\r\nin Northern Italy and there was not a man-at-arms left, factions were\r\nhushed; Angevines and Aragonese and even Spaniards unanimously agreed\r\nthat they would endure the greatest sufferings rather than consent to\r\nthe Inquisition and perfect internal peace and quiet were everywhere\r\npreserved. This did not indicate that agitation had subsided, for peace\r\nwas seriously imperilled on September 24th, when a rumor spread that\r\nroyal letters had been received ordering the Inquisition to be set to\r\nwork. Meetings of the Seggi were held and it was proposed to close the\r\nshops and ring the bells to call the people to arms, but moderate\r\ncounsels prevailed and a deputation was sent to the viceroy to assure\r\nhim that they were ready to suffer all things in preference to the\r\nInquisition. He expressed his surprise; he had no letters from the king,\r\nto whom he would write earnestly begging him to desist, and meanwhile he\r\nexhorted them to abstain from violence. Another month passed, in\r\nalternations of hope and despair; the nobles and people made a closer\r\nunion, in which they pledged their lives and property for mutual defence\r\nand this was solemnized, October 28th, with a great procession of both\r\norders, seven thousand in number, each man bearing a lighted torch.\r\n\r\nHow little Ferdinand at first thought of yielding is seen in a letter of\r\nMarch 18th to the inquisitors, acknowledging receipt of reports from\r\nthem and the viceroy; he was awaiting the envoy and meanwhile counselled\r\npatience and moderation; they must persuade the people that matters of\r\nfaith alone were concerned and when this was understood the opposition\r\nwould subside. He had ordered the payment of four months’ salaries and\r\nthey could rely on his providing everything. Then, a few days later, he\r\nannounced that the vacant place of gaoler had been filled by the\r\nappointment of the bearer, Francisco Velázquez, to whom salary was to be\r\npaid from the date of his departure. If Ferdinand had had only the\r\nNeapolitans to reckon with he would undoubtedly have imposed on them the\r\nInquisition at the cost of a revolt, but there were larger questions\r\ninvolved which counselled prudence. In preparation for trouble in\r\nNaples, he began to withdraw his troops from Verona. Julius II took the\r\nalarm at this interference with his plans and urged that the Neapolitans\r\nbe pacified. At the same time, with an eye to the possible revendication\r\nof the old papal claims on Naples, he sought popular favor by promises\r\nto the archbishop to revoke the commissions of the inquisitors and\r\ninhibit the Inquisition, thus creating a wholly unforeseen factor in the\r\nsituation. The viceroy clearly comprehended the danger of the position,\r\nwhen a revolution could so readily be brought about and the people would\r\ngladly transfer their allegiance to the pope or to France, thus costing\r\na new conquest to regain the kingdom. It is doubtful whether he acted\r\nunder positive orders from Ferdinand, or whether he assumed a certain\r\nmeasure of responsibility, stimulated by a fresh excitement arising from\r\na rumor that the Inquisition had commenced operations at Monopoli.\r\nHowever this may have been, on November 19th he sent word to the popular\r\nchiefs, inviting them to the Castello Nuovo to hear a letter from the\r\nking. Five nobles from each Seggio were deputed for the purpose, who\r\nwere followed by a crowd numbering three thousand. The viceroy read to\r\nthem two pragmáticas, by which all Jews and Conversos of Apulia and\r\nCalabria, including those who had fled from Spain after condemnation by\r\nthe Inquisition, were ordered, under pain of forfeiture of person and\r\nproperty, to leave the country by the first of March, taking with them\r\ntheir belongings, except gold and silver, the export of which was\r\nforbidden by the laws. From this the corollary followed, that as the\r\nland would thus be purged of heresy, there would be no necessity for the\r\nInquisition. Thus the unfortunate Hebrews and New Christians were\r\noffered up as a sacrifice to enable the government to retreat from an\r\nuntenable position.\r\n\r\nThe news at first was received with general rejoicings and some quarters\r\nof the town were illuminated, but the people had not been taught to\r\ntrust their rulers; doubts speedily arose that it was intended to\r\nintroduce the Inquisition by stealth and, when on November 22d the\r\nheralds came forth to proclaim the new laws, they were mobbed and driven\r\nback before they could perform the duty. The next day a delegation\r\nwaited on the viceroy and asked him to postpone the proclamation for two\r\ndays, during which they could examine the pragmáticas. This was an\r\nassumption of supervision over the legislative function which the\r\nviceroy naturally denounced as presumptuous, but the necessity of\r\nsatisfying the people was supreme and, on the next day, the Eletti by\r\nfurther insistence secured a preamble to the first pragmática, in which\r\nthe king was made to declare formally that, in view of the ancient\r\nreligion and Catholic faith of the city and kingdom, he ordered the\r\nInquisition to be removed, for the benefit of all. In this shape the\r\nproclamation was made on November 24th, and on it was founded the claim\r\nwhich, for more than two centuries, Naples persistently made that\r\nexemption from the Inquisition was one of its special privileges. Andrés\r\nPalacios departed on December 3d and thus the victory was won without\r\nbloodshed, after a struggle lasting for a year.[119]\r\n\r\nEven the pragmáticas ordering the expulsion of Jews and Conversos were\r\nnot obeyed and the situation was rendered more aggravating by the\r\nfacilities of escape from the Sicilian Inquisition afforded by the\r\nproximity of the Neapolitan territories. In June of 1513 Ferdinand wrote\r\nto the viceroy concerning this ever-present grievance and ordered him to\r\nhunt up all refugees and send them back with their property, while at\r\nthe same time a royal letter to the alcaide of Reggio rebuked him for\r\npermitting their transit and threatened him with condign punishment for\r\ncontinued negligence.[120] That it continued is shown by the escape,\r\nfrom Sicily to Naples, in the following September, of some four hundred\r\nof these unfortunates (see p. 12) and they doubtless carried with them\r\nfunds sufficient to close the eyes of those whose duty it was to turn\r\nthem back. There does not seem to have been in Italy the popular\r\nabhorrence felt in Spain for the Hebrew race or any desire for active\r\npersecution, but at the same time there was no opposition to the\r\nexistence of the Inquisition, provided always that it was not of the\r\ndreaded Spanish type. In December of the same year, 1513, the Dominican\r\nBarnaba, now styling himself papal Inquisitor of Naples, applied to\r\nFerdinand, stating that in Calabria and Apulia the New Christians lived\r\nas Jews and held their synagogues publicly; he evidently could have had\r\nno support from the local authorities, for he solicited the aid of the\r\nking. Ferdinand promptly replied, December 31st, ordering him to\r\ninvestigate secretly and, if he could catch the culprits in the act he\r\nwas, with the assistance of the Bishop of Isola, to arrest and punish\r\nthem and the viceroy and governor of the province were instructed to\r\nlend whatever aid was necessary. At the same time Ferdinand sought to\r\nmake this an entering wedge for the Spanish Inquisition, for Barnaba was\r\ntold to obey the instructions of Bishop Mercader, Inquisitor-general of\r\nAragon, with whom he was put into communication and to whom he reported.\r\nHe evidently did what he could, in the absence of secular support, for a\r\nletter of June 14, 1514, to a bishop instructs him to assist Barnaba and\r\nthe Bishop of Isola who are about to visit his diocese to punish some\r\ndescendants of Jews who are living under the Mosaic Law, but his efforts\r\nwere fruitless. When he applied to the viceroy and to the Governors of\r\nCalabria and Apulia for aid in making arrests, they replied that they\r\nwould have to consult the king. Moreover the viceroy reported that the\r\npragmáticas of 1511 were not enforced because they were construed as\r\napplicable only to natives and not to foreigners such as Spaniards and\r\nSicilians. All this stirred Ferdinand’s indignation, which found\r\nexpression in a letter of June 15, 1514, to the viceroy, accusing him\r\nand the regents and governors of sheltering the refugees,\r\ncharacterizing as absurd the construction put on the pragmáticas and\r\nordering anew that every assistance should be given to Barnaba and the\r\nBishop of Isola. In spite of all this there was a deplorable slackness\r\non the part of the secular authorities--the spirit of persecution seemed\r\nunable to cross the Faro. The Neapolitan officials would not arrest the\r\nSicilian refugees without formal requisitions from the Sicilian\r\ninquisitors, brought by a duly accredited official. From what we have\r\nseen of the disorganization of the Sicilian tribunal we can readily\r\nbelieve their assertion that they had applied to both Alonso Bernal and\r\nMelchor Cervera, but that neither had given the matter attention.\r\nFerdinand thereupon wrote to Cervera expressing his surprise at this\r\nneglect, especially as it was understood that the refugees had large\r\namounts of property concealed. This seems to have produced little effect\r\nfor when, six months later, Ferdinand scolded Don Francisco Dalagon,\r\nAlcaide of Reggio, about the refuge granted to the Sicilian fugitives,\r\nthe alcaide replied that, if he had proper authorization he would seize\r\nthem all, whereupon Ferdinand wrote, September 7th, to Cervera, ordering\r\nhim to send to Dalagon a list of the fugitives, with a commission for\r\ntheir arrest--an order which seems to have been as resultless as its\r\npredecessors.[121]\r\n\r\nWhen Ferdinand’s restless energy exhausted itself ineffectually on the\r\ninertia or corruptibility of the Neapolitan authorities, there was\r\nlittle chance that, after his death, in February, 1516, the business of\r\npersecution would be more successfully prosecuted. There was no inherent\r\nobjection to it and the old Dominican Inquisition with its limitations\r\ncontinued to exist but, in the absence of the secular support so\r\nessentially necessary to its success, its operations were spasmodic and\r\nit affords but an occasional manifestation of activity, of which few\r\nrecords have reached us. The only instances, during the next twenty\r\nyears, which the industry of Signor Amabile has discovered, are those of\r\nAngelo Squazzi, in 1521 and of Pirro Loyse Carafa, in 1536.[122] It was\r\na remarkable development from the events of 1510 that the secular\r\ncourts came to assume jurisdiction over heresy and claimed that the\r\npragmática of Ferdinand deprived the bishops of cognizance of such\r\ncases. That an assumption so subversive of the recognized principles of\r\ncanon law should call for protest was inevitable and, in the general\r\nParliament of 1536, the ninth article set forth the grievance that a lay\r\njudge had gone to Manfredonia and thrown in prison several heretics.\r\nComplaint was made to the viceroy, Pedro of Toledo, of this invasion of\r\nepiscopal rights, when he ordered the cases to be referred to the Bishop\r\nof Biscaglie but, in spite of this, the prisoners were not surrendered\r\nand remained for two years, some in the Castello Nuovo of Naples and\r\nsome in the castle of Manfredonia and, although an appeal was made to\r\nthe pope and briefs were obtained from him, these were not allowed to\r\nreach the bishop, wherefore the barons supplicated the emperor to order\r\nthe cases to be remitted to the bishop and to forbid the intrusion of\r\nthe secular courts.[123] The affair is significant of the contempt into\r\nwhich the Inquisition, both episcopal and Dominican, had fallen. Charles\r\nwas in Naples in 1536, when a letter from the Suprema to Secretary\r\nUrries alludes to a previous one of February 8th, urging upon the\r\nemperor his duty to revive the institution on the Spanish model and the\r\nsecretary is exhorted to lose no opportunity of advancing the matter,\r\nbut policy prevailed and nothing was done.[124]\r\n\r\nStill, there came a sudden resolve to enforce the pragmática of 1510,\r\nwhich seems to have been completely ignored hitherto and, in 1540, the\r\nJews were banished, after vainly pleading with Charles V at Ratisbon.\r\nMost of them went to Turkey, and the expulsion was attended with the\r\nmisfortunes inseparable from such compulsory and wholesale expatriation.\r\nMany were drowned and some were captured at sea and carried to\r\nMarseilles, where Francis I generously set them free without ransom and\r\nsent them to the Levant. Their absence speedily made itself felt\r\nthrough the deprivation of facilities for borrowing money and, to\r\nsupply the vacancy, the viceroy founded the Sagro Monte della Pietà, or\r\npublic pawnbroking establishment.[125] This expulsion, however, does not\r\nseem to indicate a recrudescence of intolerance and, if there were\r\napostate Conversos and Judaizing Christians, the authorities did not\r\ntrouble themselves about them. Yet the time was at hand when a more\r\nthreatening heresy would arouse afresh the persecuting spirit and lead\r\nthe Church to bare its sharpest weapons.\r\n\r\nLutheranism had not penetrated as far south as Naples, but the spirit of\r\ninquiry and unrest was in the air and a local centre of revolt developed\r\nthere independently. A gifted Spanish youth, Juan de Valdés, brought up\r\nin the court of Charles V and a favorite of his sovereign, attracted the\r\nattention of the Inquisition and, to avoid unpleasant consequences,\r\nabandoned his native land in 1529. After some years of wandering he\r\nsettled in Naples, in 1534, where he drew around him the choicest\r\nspirits of the time, until his death about 1540.[126] Among those whom\r\nhe deeply influenced may be mentioned Pietro Martire Vermigli,\r\nBernardino Ochino, Marcantonio Flaminio, Pietro Carnesecchi, Vittoria\r\nColonna, Isabella Manrique, Giulia Gonzaga and Costanza d’Avalos--names\r\nwhich reveal to us how Naples became a centre from which radiated\r\nthroughout Italy the reformatory influences of the age.[127] Valdés was\r\nnot a follower of Luther or of Zwingli; rather was he a disciple of\r\nErasmus, whose teachings he developed to their logical results with a\r\nhardihood from which the scholar of Rotterdam shrank, after the fierce\r\npassions aroused by the Lutheran movement had taught him caution. Though\r\nnot driven like Luther, by disputation and persecution to deny the\r\nauthority of the Holy See, there is an infinite potentiality of\r\nrebellion against the whole ecclesiastical system in Valdés’s\r\ndescription of the false conception which men are taught to entertain of\r\nGod, as a being sensitive of offence and vindictive in punishment, who\r\nis to be placated by self-inflicted austerities and by gifts of gold and\r\nsilver and worldly wealth.[128] He was also largely tinged with\r\nmysticism, even to the point of _dejamiento_ or Quietism, the result\r\npossibly of his intercourse with Pedro Luis de Alcaraz, in 1524, when\r\nthey were together in the household of the Marquis of Villena at\r\nEscalona--Alcaraz being the leader of a knot of Alumbrados, who was\r\nseverely handled by the Inquisition.[129] This is manifested in Valdés’s\r\nconception of the kingdom of God, in which man renounces the use of\r\nreason and abandons himself to divine inspiration.[130] In his little\r\ncatechism, moreover, there is a strong Lutheran tendency in the doctrine\r\nthat man is saved by faith; there is no intercessor but Christ and the\r\nwhole sacramental system, save baptism, is condemned by being\r\nsignificantly passed over in silence.[131] Still more significant is his\r\nclassification, in the _Suma de la predicazion_ Cristiana, of those who\r\nrely on vain ceremonial observances, with the worldly and wicked, as fit\r\nonly to be ejected from the Church of Christ.[132]\r\n\r\nAll these were dangerous doctrines, even when merely discussed in the\r\nlittle circle of bright intelligences which Vaidés drew around him. They\r\ndid not, moreover, lack public exposition in a guarded way. Bernardino\r\nOchino, the General Minister of the Capuchins, was reckoned the most\r\neloquent preacher in Italy. In 1536 he visited Naples, where he came in\r\ncontact with Valdés and preached the Lenten sermons with such success\r\nthat he emptied all the other churches. On February 4th of the same year\r\nCharles V, then at Naples, issued an edict forbidding, under pain of\r\ndeath and confiscation, any one from holding intercourse with Lutherans\r\nand, on his departure, he impressed on Pedro de Toledo, the viceroy, the\r\nsupreme importance of preventing the introduction of heresy. Envious\r\nfriars accused Ochino of disseminating errors in his sermons and Toledo\r\nordered him to cease preaching until he should express himself clearly\r\nin the pulpit as to the errors imputed to him, but he defended himself\r\nso skilfully that he was allowed to continue and, on his departure, he\r\nleft numerous disciples. Three years later he returned and made a\r\nsimilar impression, veiling his heretical tendencies with such dexterity\r\nthat they passed without reprehension. Yet the seed had been sown; it\r\nwas a time when theological questions were matters of universal interest\r\nand soon the city was full of men of all ranks who were discussing the\r\nPauline Epistles and debating over difficult texts. No good could come\r\nof such inquiries by the unlearned and the viceroy felt that some action\r\nwas necessary.[133] With the year 1542 came a sort of crisis in the\r\nreligious movement, not only of Naples but of Italy. The Archbishops of\r\nNaples, who were customarily cardinals residing in Rome, had long\r\nneglected the moral and spiritual condition of their see but, in that\r\nyear, the archbishop-cardinal, Francesco Carafa, conducted a visitation\r\nthere--the first for many years--and doubtless found much cause for\r\ndisquietude.[134] In that same year also, by the bull _Licet ab initio_,\r\nJuly 21st, Paul III reorganized the papal Inquisition, placed it under\r\nthe conduct of a congregation of six cardinals, and gave it the form of\r\nwhich the terrible efficiency was so thoroughly demonstrated during the\r\nsecond half of the century.[135] In September of that year, moreover,\r\nOchino and Vermigli threw off all disguise and openly embraced\r\nProtestantism. This naturally cast suspicion on their admirers and the\r\nviceroy commenced a persecution; preachers were set to work to\r\ncontrovert the heretical doctrines; an edict was issued requiring the\r\nsurrender of heretical books, of which large numbers were collected and\r\nsolemnly burnt, and a pragmática of October 15, 1544, established a\r\ncensorship of the press. Finally, Toledo wrote to the emperor that\r\nsterner measures were necessary to check the evil and Charles ordered\r\nhim to introduce the Inquisition as cautiously as possible.[136]\r\n\r\nIt seems to have been recognized as useless to endeavor to establish the\r\nSpanish Inquisition and Charles was not as firmly attached to that\r\ninstitution as his grandfather Ferdinand had been, but it was hoped\r\nthat, by dexterous management, the way might be opened to bring in the\r\npapal Holy Office.[137] Towards the end of 1546 Toledo wrote to his\r\nbrother, the Cardinal of San Sisto, who was one of the six members of\r\nthe Congregation, expressing his desire to introduce the Inquisition and\r\nhis dread of the consequences, for the very name was an abomination to\r\nall, from the highest to the lowest, and he feared that it might lead to\r\na successful revolution. To encompass the object, it was finally\r\nresolved to procure from the pope a commission for an inquisitor against\r\nheresy which was prevalent among the clergy, both regular and secular.\r\nThe required commission was issued, in February, 1547, to the prior and\r\nthe lector of the Dominican convent of Santa Caterina; Toledo did not\r\npersonally grant the exequatur for it but caused this to be done by the\r\nregents of the _Consiglio Collaterale_, but this precaution and the\r\nprofound secrecy observed were useless. Rumors spread among the people\r\nthat orders had been received from the cardinals to proceed against\r\nregular and secular clerks; the old animosity against anything but the\r\nepiscopal Inquisition at once flamed up and deputies were sent to the\r\nviceroy to beg him not to grant the exequatur. He assured them that he\r\nwondered himself at the fact; he had written to the pope that it was not\r\nCharles’s will or intention that the Inquisition should be introduced\r\nand that meanwhile he had not granted the exequatur. Little faith was\r\nplaced in his statements and the general belief was that Paul III was\r\neager to create strife in Naples in order to give the emperor occupation\r\nthere and check his growing ascendency. It is said that he actually sent\r\ntwo inquisitors but, if so, they never dared to show themselves, for\r\nthere is no allusion to them in the detailed accounts of the ensuing\r\ntroubles.\r\n\r\nTo carry out the plot, action was commenced in a tentative way by the\r\narchiepiscopal vicar affixing at the door of his palace an edict\r\nforbidding the discussion of religion by laymen and announcing that he\r\nwould proceed by inquisition to examine into the beliefs held by the\r\nclergy. The very word inquisition was sufficient to inflame the people;\r\ncries of _serra, serra!_ were heard and the aspect of affairs was so\r\nalarming that the vicar went into hiding and the edict was removed. The\r\nPiazze of the nobles were assembled and elected deputies charged with\r\nenforcing the observance of the _capitoli_, or liberties of the city.\r\nThe Piazza del Popolo was crippled, for the viceroy some months\r\npreviously, in preparation for the struggle, had dismissed the Eletto\r\nand replaced him with Domenico Terracina, a creature of his own, who did\r\nnot assemble his Piazza but appointed the deputies himself. Then, on\r\nPalm Sunday (April 3d), Toledo sent for Terracina and the heads of the\r\nOttine and charged them to see that those guilty of the agitation were\r\npunished but, in place of doing this the Piazze assembled and sent to\r\nhim deputies who boldly represented the universal abhorrence felt for\r\nthe Inquisition which gave such facilities for false witness that it\r\nwould ruin the city and kingdom, and they expressed the universal\r\nsuspicion felt that the edict portended its introduction. The viceroy\r\nsoothed them with the assurance that the emperor had no such intention;\r\nas for himself, if the emperor should attempt it, he would tire him out\r\nwith supplications to desist and, if unsuccessful, would resign his post\r\nand leave the city. But, as there were people who talked about religion\r\nwithout understanding, it was necessary that they should be punished\r\naccording to the canons by the ordinary jurisdiction. This answer\r\nsatisfied the majority, but still there were some who regarded with\r\nanxiety the implied threat conveyed in the last phrase.\r\n\r\nThen, on May 11th, the patience of the people was further tested by\r\nanother edict affixed on the archiepiscopal doors, which hinted more\r\nclearly at the Inquisition. At once the city rose, with cries of _armi,\r\narmi! serra, serra!_ The edict was torn down; Terracina was compelled\r\nagainst his will to convene the Piazza del Popolo, where he and his\r\nsubordinates were promptly dismissed from office and replaced with men\r\nwho could be relied upon. The ejected officials could scarce show\r\nthemselves in the streets and three of them were only saved from popular\r\nvengeance by taking sanctuary. The viceroy came from his winter\r\nresidence at Pozzuoli breathing vengeance. He garrisoned the Castello\r\nNuovo with three thousand Spanish troops and ordered the popular leaders\r\nto be prosecuted. By a curious coincidence, one of these was Tommaso\r\nAniello, whose homonym, a century later, led the revolt of 1647. He it\r\nwas who had torn down the edict and forced Terracina to assemble the\r\nPiazza. He was summoned to appear in court, but he came accompanied with\r\nso great a crowd, under the command of Cesare Mormile, that the judges\r\nwere afraid to proceed and when the people seized Terracina’s children\r\nas hostages, Aniello was discharged. Then Mormile was cited and went\r\naccompanied by forty men, armed under their garments and carrying papers\r\nlike pleaders; the presiding judge was informed of this and dismissed\r\nthe case.\r\n\r\nFinding legal measures useless the viceroy adopted severer methods. On\r\nMay 16th the garrison made a sortie as far as the Rua Castillana, firing\r\nhouses and slaying without distinction of age or sex. The bells of San\r\nLorenzo tolled to arms; shops were closed and the people rushed to the\r\ncastle, where they found the Spaniards drawn up in battle array. Blinded\r\nwith rage, they flung themselves on the troops and lost some two hundred\r\nand fifty men uselessly, while the cannon from the castle bombarded the\r\ncity. Angry recrimination and threats followed; the citizens determined\r\nto arm the city, not for rebellion, as they asserted, but to preserve it\r\nfor the emperor. Throughout the whole of this unhappy business, they\r\nwere strenuously eager to demonstrate their loyalty and, when the news\r\ncame of Charles’s victory over the German Protestants at Muhlberg, April\r\n24th, the city manifested its rejoicing by an illumination for three\r\nnights. So when, on May 22d, the viceroy ordered another sortie, in\r\nwhich there was considerable slaughter, the citizens hoisted on San\r\nLorenzo a banner with the imperial arms and their war-cry was “Imperio e\r\nSpagna.” They raised some troops and placed them under the command of\r\nGianfrancesco and Pasquale Caracciolo and Cesare Mormile, but it was\r\ndifficult to form a standing army, owing to the question of pay, as the\r\nmoney had to be raised by voluntary subscription.\r\n\r\nBad as was the situation, it was embittered when some catch-poles of the\r\nVicariat arrested a man for debt. On the way to prison he resisted and\r\ncalled for aid; three young nobles stopped to enquire the cause and,\r\nduring the parley, the prisoner escaped. This enraged Toledo, who had\r\nthe youths arrested at night and condemned with scarce a pretext of\r\ntrial. On May 24th they were brought out on the bridge in front of the\r\nCastello Nuovo, where their throats were cut by a slave and the corpses\r\nwere left in blood and mud, with a placard prohibiting their removal.\r\nThis gratuitous cruelty inflamed the people almost to madness; houses\r\nand shops were closed, arms were seized and crowds rushed through the\r\nstreets, threatening they scarce knew what. To manifest his contempt for\r\nthe populace, Toledo rode quietly through the town, where he would\r\ninfallibly have been shot had not Cesare Mormile, the Prior of Bari and\r\nothers of the popular leaders earnestly dissuaded reprisals. Meetings\r\nwere held in which the nobles and people formally united for the common\r\ndefence, which was always regarded as a most threatening portent for the\r\nsovereign, and they resolved to send envoys to the emperor, for which\r\noffice they selected the Prince of Salerno, the greatest noble of the\r\nland, and Placido di Sangro, a gentleman of high quality. Toledo\r\nsummoned the envoys and told them that, if their mission concerned the\r\nInquisition, it was superfluous, for he would pledge himself within two\r\nmonths to have a letter from the emperor declaring that nothing more\r\nshould be done about it; if it was about the _Capitoli_, he could assure\r\nthem that any infraction of the city’s privileges would be duly\r\npunished; if it was to complain of him, they were welcome to go. The\r\nenvoys were too well pleased with their appointment to accept his offer\r\nand wait two months for its fulfilment; the people suspected the viceroy\r\nof trickery and the envoys set out. Six days later they were followed by\r\nthe Marquis della Valle, sent by the viceroy to counteract their\r\nmission; the prince dallied in Rome with the cardinals, so that della\r\nValle reached the court before him and gained the ear of the emperor.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile crowds of exiles and adventurers, under chosen leaders, came\r\nflocking into the city and a guerrilla warfare was organized against the\r\nSpaniards, who had advanced from house to house up to the Cancellaria\r\nvecchia, making loop-holes in the walls and shooting everyone within\r\nrange. With the aid of these reinforcements the Spaniards were gradually\r\ndriven back to the Incoronata. On the other hand Antonio Doria came with\r\nhis galleys, bringing a large force of Spanish troops. Of course the\r\ncourts were closed and a state of virtual anarchy might be expected, yet\r\nthe chronicler tells us that four things were remarkable. First, there\r\nwere no homicides, assaults, or other crimes. Second, although there was\r\nno government of the city, yet food and wine were abundant and cheap and\r\nno fraud or violence was committed on those who came with provisions.\r\nThird, although there were great numbers of exiles or bandits, with\r\ntheir chiefs, some of them bitterly hostile towards each other, there\r\nwas no quarrelling or treachery; on one occasion two mortal enemies met,\r\neach at the head of his band and a fight was expected, but one said\r\n“Camillo, this is not the time to settle our affair,” to which the other\r\nreplied “Certainly; let us fight the common enemy; there will be ample\r\ntime afterwards for our matter.” Fourth, the prison of the Vicaria was\r\nfull of prisoners, some condemned to death and others held for debt, but\r\nno attempt was made to rescue them and food was sent to them as usual by\r\nwomen and children. Evidently the people felt that they were fighting\r\nfor their liberties and would not allow their cause to be compromised by\r\ncommon lawlessness.\r\n\r\nAt length Toledo’s preparations for a decisive stroke were completed\r\nand, on July 22d, a sortie was made in force, while the guns of the\r\nfortresses and galleys bombarded the city. There was much slaughter and\r\nsome four hundred houses were burnt, whose ruins blockaded the streets.\r\nDesultory fighting continued for some days and then a truce was agreed\r\nupon until the envoys should return. On August 7th came Placido di\r\nSangro, the bearer of a simple order, signed by Secretary Vargas, to the\r\neffect that the Prince of Salerno should remain in the court, while he\r\nshould return and tell the people of Naples to lay down their arms and\r\nobey the viceroy. This cruel disappointment came near producing a\r\nviolent outbreak, but the Prior of Bari succeeded in quieting the people\r\nand persuading them to obey the emperor. The next day, by order of the\r\nEletti, a huge collection of arms was made, loaded on wagons and carried\r\nto the viceroy. Then the tribunals were opened and every one returned to\r\nhis private business. On August 12th the viceroy summoned the Eletti and\r\nread to them a royal indult, which purported to be granted at his\r\nrequest, pardoning the people for their revolt, except those already\r\ncondemned and seventeen other specified persons. Most of those deeply\r\ncompromised had, however, already sought safety in flight.\r\n\r\nThis doubtful mercy did not amount to much. A bishop came, commissioned\r\nby the emperor, to try the city for its misdeeds when, as we are told,\r\nthrough the procurement of the viceroy, witnesses were found to swear\r\nthat the cry of _Francia, Francia!_ was often raised. Whether this was\r\ntrue or not, the letters of Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, imperial\r\nambassador at Rome, show that active negotiations had been carried on\r\nwith both France and the pope, and the sovereignty of Naples had even\r\nbeen offered to Cardinal Farnese, the grandson of the latter. Mendoza\r\nevidently regarded Paul III as ready to take advantage of the situation\r\nif occasion offered and, when the revolt was suppressed, he mentions\r\nthat the fugitives received a warm welcome in Rome. It is not surprising\r\ntherefore that the decision of the episcopal commissioner was adverse to\r\nthe city, containing, among other things, a fine of a hundred thousand\r\nducats for ringing the bells as a call to arms.\r\n\r\nThe viceroy, moreover, by no means confined himself to the persons\r\nexcepted from pardon, but threw into prison all the leaders whom he\r\ncould seize. He had already published a considerable list of those\r\nexcluded and the seventeen also grew to fifty-six, of whom twenty-six\r\nwere condemned to death, although it does not appear that any were\r\nactually executed, and the prisoners were gradually liberated,\r\ntwenty-four at one time, four at another and all the rest in 1553. Among\r\nthem was Placido di Sangro, whose friends could not learn the cause of\r\nhis confinement and sent Luigi di Sangro to the emperor to find out.\r\nCharles said that Placido was _buon cavaliero_, but that he was a great\r\ntalker and that orders had already been sent to the viceroy about him.\r\nThe incident which left on the emperor the impression of Placido’s\r\nloquacity is too characteristic of the former’s good-nature to be\r\nomitted. Once, as he left his chamber, Placido followed him, pleading\r\nfor the city; he appeared not to listen and Placido had the audacity to\r\npluck his mantle and ask his attention. Charles turned smilingly and\r\nsaid “Go on Placido, I am listening.” The Duke of Alva was close behind\r\nand Placido said “Signore, I cannot talk, for the Duke of Alva hears all\r\nI say,” to which Charles replied, laughing, “Tell him not to hear it”\r\nand then obligingly drew Placido to one side and let him say all that he\r\nwanted. The conclusion of the whole business was that their arms were\r\nreturned to the citizens and the emperor contented himself with the\r\nfine, but the hated viceroy kept his post until his death in 1553, and\r\nno assurance against the Inquisition was obtained.[138]\r\n\r\nYet the stubborn endurance of the Neapolitans had won a temporary\r\nvictory. Although they gained no formal condition of exemption from the\r\npapal Inquisition, the attempt to introduce it was, for the moment,\r\nabandoned. For awhile even the episcopal jurisdiction over heresy\r\nappears to have been inert, as it has left no traces during the next few\r\nyears. This respite, however, was brief, for the tide of persecution was\r\narising in Italy. In March, 1551, Julius III issued a savage bull,\r\npronouncing by the authority of God eternal malediction on all who\r\nshould interfere with bishop or inquisitor in their prosecution of\r\nheretics.[139] Paul III, in 1549, on the resignation of Cardinal\r\nFarnese, had appointed, as archbishop of Naples, Cardinal Carafa, who\r\nwas unsparing in the extirpation of heresy and had been the leader in\r\npromoting the reorganization of the papal Inquisition in 1542, of which\r\nhe was made the head. Charles V had refused to grant his exequatur to\r\nCarafa, but yielded, in July, 1551, to the urgency of Julius, and Carafa\r\nlost no time in appointing Scipione Rebiba as his vicar-general, through\r\nwhom the papal Inquisition was introduced into Naples.[140] It was at\r\nfirst confined to his archiepiscopate, for various letters to bishops,\r\nin 1552, from the viceroy Toledo show them to be busy in the prosecution\r\nof heretics.[141] Toledo died, February 12, 1553 and was succeeded by\r\nCardinal Pacheco, who did not reach Naples until June. The interval,\r\nunder Toledo’s son Luis, seems to have been thought opportune for\r\nextending the jurisdiction of the papal Inquisition for, by a decree of\r\nthe Congregation, May 30, 1553, Rebiba was created its delegate and\r\nsubsequently styled himself “Vicar of Naples and Commissioner of the\r\nHoly Inquisition of Rome.”[142]\r\n\r\nIn 1555 the episcopal jurisdiction was completely subordinated to the\r\npapal, for we find several instances in which prisoners of bishops were\r\ndemanded by the Roman Inquisition, when Mendoza, the lieutenant of the\r\nViceroy Pacheco, orders them sent under good guard to Naples, in order\r\nto be transmitted to Rome and, in 1556, it would even seem that bishops\r\nwere required to obtain Roman commissions, for a letter of Mendoza to\r\nthe Bishop of Reggio reproves him for publishing his commission before\r\nit had received the vice-regal exequatur.[143] It was probably to\r\nreconcile the Neapolitans to this intrusion of the authority of the\r\nabhorred institution that, by a brief of April 7, 1554, Julius III\r\nabolished the penalty of confiscation, but this grace was illusory, for\r\nit required the assent of the sovereign which was withheld and the brief\r\nitself was revoked by Paul IV in 1556.[144]\r\n\r\nIt was not long after this that occasion offered to extend still more\r\ndirectly the authority of Rome. Early in the fourteenth century, bands\r\nof Waldenses, from the Alpine valleys, flying from persecution, had\r\nsettled in the mountains of Calabria and Apulia. Their example was\r\nfollowed by others; they increased and multiplied in peace, under\r\ncovenants from the crown and from the nobles, on whose lands they\r\nsettled and made productive, until it was estimated that they numbered\r\nten thousand souls. As a matter of self-protection they strictly\r\nprohibited marriage with the natives, they used only their own language\r\nand their faith was kept pure by biennial visits from the _barbes_ or\r\ntravelling pastors of their sect, but it was under a prudent reserve,\r\nfor they occasionally went to mass, they allowed their children to be\r\nbaptized and they were punctual in the payment of tithes, which secured\r\nfor them the benevolent indifference of the local priesthood.[145] More\r\nthan two centuries of this undisturbed existence seemed to promise\r\nperpetual immunity, but the passions aroused on both sides by the\r\nLutheran revolt were too violent to admit of toleration earned by\r\ndissimulation. The heretical movement in Naples seems to have aroused\r\nmore watchful scrutiny for, in January, 1551, the Spanish Holy Office\r\nhad information, through its Sicilian tribunal, about the Waldenses,\r\nwhom it styled Lutherans, and it wrote to Charles V urging him to adopt\r\nmeasures for their eradication.[146] Nothing came of this, however, and\r\nthe peaceful sectaries might possibly have remained in obscurity had\r\nthey not commenced to feel dissatisfied with their ancestral teachings\r\nand sent to Geneva for more modern instructors. Religious zeal in Geneva\r\nwas at a white heat and the missionaries despatched--Giovan Liugi\r\nPascale and Giacomo Bonelli--were not men to make compromises with\r\nSatan. They made no secret of their beliefs and they paid the penalty,\r\nthe one being strangled and burnt in Rome, September 15, 1560, and the\r\nother in Palermo.[147] Pascale had been arrested, about May 1, 1559, by\r\nSalvatore Spinello, lord of La Guardia, apparently to preserve his\r\nvassals from persecution for, since the coming of the ardent\r\nmissionaries, they had ceased to attend mass.[148] With his companions\r\nhe was carried to Cosenza and delivered to the archiepiscopal\r\nauthorities. Then the viceroy, the Duke of Alcalá, intervened in a\r\nmanner to show how uncertain as yet was the inquisitorial jurisdiction,\r\nfor in letters of February 9, 1560, he urged the episcopal Ordinary to\r\ntry the prisoners for heresy and, to prevent errors, he was to call for\r\nadvice and assistance on a lay judge, Maestro Bernardino Santacroce, to\r\nwhom powers and instructions were duly sent, thus constituting a mixed\r\ntribunal under royal authority.[149] Eventually however the papal\r\nInquisition claimed and took Pascale, who was carried to Rome and\r\nexecuted.\r\n\r\nIts attention was thus called to the Calabrian heretics, but it was not\r\nuntil November 13, 1560, that the Dominican Valerio Malvicino da\r\nPiacenza presented himself at Cosenza as inquisitor commissioned by Rome\r\nto take the affair in charge. He wandered around among the Waldensian\r\nvillages of Montalto, San Sisto and La Guardia, distinguishing himself,\r\nwe are told, as a glutton and drunkard, and investigating the beliefs of\r\nthe people. Then at San Sisto he ordered them all to abjure their errors\r\nand wear the “habitello” or sanbenito. This they refused, nor had he\r\nmore success at Montalto, though at La Guardia many abjured on his\r\ntelling them that their brethren at San Sisto had done so. Castañeto,\r\nthe Spanish Governor of Montalto, prepared to arrest the principal\r\ninhabitants of San Sisto, when the whole population took to the woods,\r\nand Fra Valerio returned to Cosenza to seek aid from the Marquis of\r\nBucchianico, Governor of Calabria, who chanced to be there. He ordered\r\nthe people to lay down their arms and return to San Sisto, which they\r\nobediently did, on May 8, 1561, but they took flight again on being\r\ncommanded to present themselves in Cosenza with their wives and\r\nchildren. Castañeto then raised a force to reduce them; he allowed them\r\nto send the women and children back to San Sisto, before attacking them,\r\nbut when he did so he fell with fifty of his men. This victory availed\r\nlittle to the victors. San Sisto was burnt; the women and children,\r\nsubjected to every species of outrage, scattered through the mountains,\r\nwhere most of them were captured and sent to Cosenza; hunger forced the\r\nmen to disband and nearly all of them fell into the hands of\r\nBucchianico.\r\n\r\nSan Sisto being thus settled, Bucchianico proceeded to La Guardia with\r\nFra Valerio and a commissioner named Pansa appointed by the viceroy to\r\nexecute justice. Many of the inhabitants fled, but returned under\r\npromise of pardon--their flight being subsequently held as relapse into\r\nthe errors which they had previously abjured. These numbered 300 men and\r\n100 women, the latter of whom were sent to Cosenza, while the former,\r\ntogether with the captives of San Sisto, were carried to Montalto, where\r\na sort of inquisitorial tribunal was formed, consisting of Fra Valerio,\r\nPansa, and two auditors, Barone and Cove. These divided the prisoners\r\nbetween them and each proceeded to employ torture indiscriminately to\r\nforce them to confess the foul practices ascribed to them and to profess\r\nconversion. Those who were condemned were confined in a warehouse and\r\ntheir sentence was read in presence of a crowd gathered from all the\r\nneighboring towns. The auto de fe which followed, June 11, 1561, is\r\ndescribed in a letter written the same day from Montalto by a Catholic\r\nwho cannot conceal his profound horror at the scene. From their place of\r\nconfinement the executioner led his victims one by one, bandaging their\r\neyes with the bloody rag which had served for their predecessors. Like\r\nsheep to the slaughter they were thus taken to the public square where\r\nhe cut their throats; they were then quartered and the fragments were\r\ndistributed on poles along the roads from one end of Calabria to the\r\nother--a spectacle which another pious contemporary describes as fearful\r\nto the heretic while confirming the true believer in the faith. The\r\nnumber thus butchered on that day amounted to eighty-eight, while in\r\naddition there were seven who had triumphed over the torture and refused\r\nto recant their heresies, and these were to be burnt alive as\r\nimpenitents. Sentence of death was also pronounced against a hundred of\r\nthe older women; the whole number of captives was reckoned at 1600, all\r\nof whom were condemned. The writer adds that unless the Holy See and the\r\nviceroy interfere, Bucchianico will not hold his hand until he has\r\ndestroyed them all.[150]\r\n\r\nHe doubtless continued his cruel work with the rest of his prisoners,\r\nbut details are lacking for our next source of information is a letter\r\nof June 27th, written from Montalto by Luigi d’Appiano (apparently an\r\nofficial of the Archbishop of Reggio) to the Abate Parpaglia. Rome had\r\ntaken alarm at the butchery of June 11th and had commissioned the\r\narchbishop, then returning to Naples, to take charge of the affair and\r\nconduct it in more regular fashion. D’Appiano explains that the\r\nprisoners from La Guardia were regarded as relapsed (and consequently\r\nto be abandoned to the secular arm), because they had abjured, while\r\nthose from San Sisto, who had not, were simple heretics, whom the Church\r\nwould receive back on their submission. He tells us that Bucchianico,\r\nwith the commissioner and the archiepiscopal vicar of Cosenza, had\r\nconcluded to impose a salutary penance on the least guilty; those more\r\nobstinate were to be sent to the galleys, and the ministers and leaders\r\nto the stake; of these five had already been sent to Cosenza to be burnt\r\nalive, after smearing them with pitch so as to prolong their sufferings\r\nand serve as a terrifying example. A reward of ten crowns a head had\r\nbeen offered for the capture of fugitives and they were being daily\r\nbrought in. Many women prisoners, who were instruments of the devil,\r\nwere to be burnt and of these five, who had confessed to the nocturnal\r\norgies attributed to the heretics, would be executed at Cosenza the next\r\nday.[151] All children under fifteen years of age were scattered among\r\nCatholic families, at a distance of at least eight miles from the\r\nWaldensian settlements and were forbidden to intermarry.[152] How long\r\nthe persecution lasted does not appear, but a letter of December 12,\r\n1561, from the viceroy, alludes to prisoners whose trials he ordered to\r\nbe expedited.[153]\r\n\r\nThat the persecution was religious and not political is seen in the fact\r\nthat the people of San Sisto, who had risen in arms and had defended\r\nthemselves, were treated with much less harshness than those of La\r\nGuardia whose offence was technically construed as relapse into heresy.\r\nThe conditions imposed on those who were spared the galleys or the stake\r\nconfirm this. The Roman Inquisition prescribed that all should wear the\r\nyellow habitello with the red cross; that all should hear mass every\r\nday, before going to labor, under heavy fines; that confession and\r\ncommunion should be observed on the prescribed feast-days by all of\r\nproper age; that for twenty-five years there should be no intermarriage\r\nbetween them; that all communication with Piedmont and Geneva should\r\ncease, together with various other prescriptions looking to the training\r\nof the children in the faith and the instruction of the elders. To these\r\nFra Valerio added that not more than six persons should assemble\r\ntogether and that their native tongue, which they had sedulously\r\npreserved, should be abandoned for Italian.[154]\r\n\r\nIn the exigencies of the moment the papal Inquisition had thus obtained\r\na recognition in Neapolitan territory for which it had hitherto been\r\nvainly struggling, but it was intermingled with the episcopal and royal\r\njurisdictions in a manner indicating how little organization there was\r\nfor action in an emergency. The royal jurisdiction, moreover, asserted\r\nitself still further when, November 13, 1561, the viceroy issued a\r\ncommission to Fra Valerio as inspector of heretical books throughout the\r\nkingdom, authorizing him to go to the points of importation and\r\nempowering him to summon to his aid the secular magistrates--a\r\ncommission which was renewed May 8, 1562.[155] The viceroy also enforced\r\none of the provisions of the Spanish Inquisition, for he laid claim to\r\nthe confiscations and, on September 17, 1561, he commissioned Dr.\r\nAntonio Moles to proceed to the spot and take possession of all the\r\nproperty of those convicted, including the debts due to them. Apparently\r\nthere had been general plunder, for he was empowered to enforce the\r\nsurrender of what had been taken. Dr. Moles seems to have had much\r\ntrouble with clerics, who had been active in the spoiling and had\r\ncommitted many enormous offences; as clerics they were beyond his\r\njurisdiction, but the vicar of Cosenza sent him an assistant to exercise\r\nthe necessary spiritual jurisdiction.[156] As La Guardia and San Sisto\r\nhad both been burnt and the country laid waste, there cannot have been\r\nmuch left to confiscate, but Dr. Moles seems to have conscientiously\r\nstripped the land bare, for when the results were sent to Naples and\r\nsold at auction they produced a handsome amount of money.[157] This\r\nevidently represents only the movable property; the real-estate seems to\r\nhave been granted by Philip II to the Confraternity for the redemption\r\nof captives; it was valued at 5000 ducats and was sold for 2500 by the\r\nConfraternity to Salvatore Spinello. He had been created Marquis of\r\nFuscaldo in recompense for the zeal with which he had aided the\r\nInquisition in destroying his vassals, and he finally sold the lands to\r\nthe communities for an annual revenue of 180 ducats.[158] Strenuous as\r\nwere the methods of the Inquisition, however, deeply rooted faiths have\r\npower of protracted resistance, and some correspondence of the Roman\r\nCongregation with the Duchess of Montesalto, in 1599 and 1600, would\r\nindicate that there were still remnants of these heretics in Calabria\r\nand that there was talk of establishing a school for their\r\nconversion.[159]\r\n\r\nThe Waldenses of Apulia had a milder fate. The ruin and butchery in\r\nCalabria was a warning to all parties. Their lords were powerful\r\nnobles--the Prince of Molfetta, the Duke of Airola, the Count of Biccari\r\nand others--who did not wish to see their lands laid waste and\r\ndepopulated. Fra Valerio was not called in, but a papal commission was\r\nprocured for Ferdinando Anna, Bishop of Bovino, in whose diocese most of\r\nthe infected district lay; less inhuman measures were employed and\r\ndoubtless the savage work in Calabria led the heretics to be\r\naccommodating. Only a few of the more zealous were prosecuted; the mass\r\nof the population submitted and seem to have been taken to the bosom of\r\nMother Church without severe penalties.[160]\r\n\r\nPossibly Fra Valerio may have been engaged in more congenial occupation\r\nin the province of Reggio, where at this time there were discovered some\r\nsurvivors of those who had embraced the doctrines taught by Juan de\r\nValdés. The viceroy sent thither the Commissioner Panza, fresh from his\r\nlabors at Montalto. He must have had inquisitorial assistance and\r\nthough, in the fragmentary records, Fra Valerio’s name does not appear,\r\nhe was the most probable collaborator in the active work which ensued.\r\nFour citizens of Reggio and eleven of San Lorenzo were burnt, while a\r\nnumber abjured and escaped with imposition of the habitello.[161]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn all these proceedings there is an incongruous intermingling of\r\njurisdictions--papal, episcopal and secular--which shows how well the\r\npeople had thus far succeeded in preventing the establishment of an\r\norganized Inquisition. They looked with complacency on the sufferings of\r\nthe heretics and offered no opposition to the measures adopted,\r\nsatisfied with the participation of the civil and episcopal powers. They\r\nhad, however, lost none of their horror of the Spanish institution and,\r\nwhen Philip II endeavored to force it upon Milan, their fears were\r\naroused that it might be imposed upon Naples. In 1564 there was much\r\npopular excitement; the Piazze assembled and adopted strong\r\ndeclarations; Pius IV, who did not wish to see the Spanish Inquisition\r\nin Italy, seconded these efforts and peremptorily ordered the Theatin\r\nPaolo d’Arezzo--subsequently cardinal and archbishop of Naples--to\r\naccept the mission with which the city charged him to Philip, to\r\nremonstrate against the threatened introduction of the Inquisition and\r\nalso to ask for the revival of the brief of Julius III abolishing\r\nconfiscations. The latter request Philip refused but, in letters of\r\nMarch 10, 1565, he assured his subjects that he had no intention of\r\nintroducing the Spanish Inquisition and that trials for heresy should be\r\nconducted in the ordinary way as heretofore.[162]\r\n\r\nThe “via ordinaria” meant episcopal jurisdiction exercised in accordance\r\nwith the practice of the spiritual courts in other criminal trials as\r\ndistinguished from the secret procedure of the Inquisition, which denied\r\nto the accused almost every means of defence. This in the subsequent\r\nstruggles was constantly cited by the Neapolitans as their protection,\r\nbut it was easily evaded. The Roman Inquisition, it is true, was not\r\nallowed to organize a tribunal with an inquisitor at its head and\r\ncommissioners in all the cities, as was the case in the northern\r\nprovinces of Italy, and to exhibit its power with the spectacle of autos\r\nde fe, but it had its agents more or less openly and its victims were\r\ntransmitted to Rome for trial and execution. Alongside of this, for a\r\ntime at least, the episcopal jurisdiction over heresy was fully\r\nrecognized and a number of vice-regal letters of the period show that it\r\nwas vigorously exercised by some of the prelates, though whether by the\r\n_via ordinaria_ or not does not appear.[163] This gratified the\r\nNeapolitans who, in 1571, sent a deputation to Archbishop Carafa to\r\ncongratulate him on his holy labors against the heretics and Jews and to\r\nask him to express to the pope their satisfaction that these people\r\nshould be punished and extirpated by the episcopal Ordinaries, according\r\nto the canons and without the interposition of the secular court.[164]\r\nThis is a scarcely veiled hint of the popular detestation of the\r\nInquisition, whether Spanish or papal, and that this continued unabated\r\nis manifested by the Venetian envoy, Girolamo Lippomani who, in his\r\nrelation of 1575, describes the Neapolitans as most religious and filled\r\nwith zeal for the love of God, but nevertheless they will not endure the\r\nvery name of the Inquisition and would be ready to rise against it as\r\nthey have done in the past.[165]\r\n\r\nThe occasion of this address to the archbishop presumably was a lively\r\npersecution of Judaizers then on foot. There had been many abjurations,\r\nsome burnings, and the archbishop was preparing to build cells attached\r\nto the walls of his palace to provide for the confinement of those\r\nsentenced to perpetual prison. There was considerable popular excitement\r\nbecause an inquisitorial deputy, with the title of vicar, had been sent\r\nfrom Rome, and there was faction among the citizens, for the number of\r\naccused was large, with kinships ramifying throughout the community.\r\nCardinal Granvelle, then recently appointed viceroy, in a letter of July\r\n31, 1571, to the Cardinal of Pisa, head of the Roman Inquisition,\r\nexpressed his fears of a tumult; he had asked the archbishop to suspend\r\nthe prosecutions and postpone building the cells; it would be better to\r\nsend, as the pope desired, the accused to Rome, where they would be\r\nvigorously punished. In effect, towards the end of December, four women\r\nand three men were sent as Judaizers to Rome, where they were duly\r\nstrangled and burnt on February 9, 1572.[166]\r\n\r\nThis sending of the accused to the Roman Inquisition, whether for trial\r\nor execution, gradually became the accepted custom, as a sort of\r\ncompromise between the pretensions of the Holy Office and the settled\r\nrepugnance of the people. It was not, however, without some\r\ncomplications. Of old, no arrests by the Inquisition were permitted\r\nwithout the royal assent in each case, but in the absence of an\r\norganized Inquisition this salutary rule seems to have been forgotten\r\nand it evidently was not observed in the Calabrian persecutions. When,\r\nhowever, in 1568, the authorities of Reggio were ordered by the Sicilian\r\ntribunal to arrest and forward two individuals charged with heresy,\r\nobedience was refused and the Duke of Alcalá, still viceroy, was\r\nnotified. He approved the position taken but instructed the officials to\r\narrest the parties and hold them until the Sicilian tribunal should\r\nreport whether the alleged offences were committed in Sicily or in\r\nNaples; in the former case he was to forward them; in the latter to hold\r\nthem until it should be determined whether they were justiciable by the\r\nOrdinary or by the Roman Holy Office, and such was to be the rule\r\nhereafter. The Sicilian tribunal did not relish this interference with\r\nits arbitrary methods and the next month there came news that two of its\r\nemissaries had landed at Reggio, gone inland and carried off to Messina\r\na friar from an Augustinian convent; moreover they were now endeavoring\r\nto do the same with another of the brethren. Thereupon the viceroy\r\nordered the utmost watchfulness to be observed and, if any attempt of\r\nthe kind were made, the inquisitorial agents were to be thrown in prison\r\nand held for his instructions.[167]\r\n\r\nIf this caution was necessary in dealing with a province under the same\r\ncrown, much more was it applicable to the Roman Congregation of the\r\nInquisition. No independent state could permit its citizens to be\r\nabducted, without the knowledge of the authorities, at the bidding of a\r\nforeign prince whose policy at any moment might be hostile. To submit to\r\nsuch a claim was an abdication of sovereignty.[168] Moreover, nearly all\r\nCatholic kingdoms had been forced, by the perpetual meddling of the\r\npapacy with their internal affairs, to adopt the rule that no papal\r\nrescript of any kind should be enforced without first submitting it to\r\nthe government for its exequatur. Naples, as especially exposed to\r\npapal encroachments, was particularly careful as to this, and no brief,\r\nhowever trivial, was allowed to take effect without being submitted to\r\nthe authorities for approval.[169] In 1567 we find Pius V exhaling his\r\nindignation to Philip II at the violation of the rights of the Holy See\r\nbecause a bishop, whom he had sent to Naples as visitor to report on the\r\ncondition of the clergy, was not allowed to exercise his functions\r\nwithout the exequatur.[170]\r\n\r\nThis necessarily applied to the citations and orders of arrest with\r\nwhich the Roman Inquisition was endeavoring to extend its jurisdiction\r\nover Naples. In April, 1564, Hieronimo de Monte, Apostolic Commissioner\r\nin Benevento (a papal enclave in Neapolitan territory), in the case of\r\nthe Marquis of Vico, was taking testimony to the effect that no one\r\nwould dare to serve a summons from Rome on him without the vice-regal\r\nexequatur, as he would thus expose himself to punishment, including\r\nperhaps the galleys.[171] Rome endeavored to evade this limitation on\r\nits jurisdiction and was met with consistent firmness. In 1568 Alcalá\r\nwas informed that, under orders from the Inquisition, the bishop had\r\narrested a citizen named Martino Bagnato and was holding him for\r\ntransmission to Rome. The bishop was at once notified that he must\r\nsurrender the prisoner to the captain of the city, to be held subject to\r\nprosecution in the _via ordinaria_ by his competent judge, and the\r\ncaptain was ordered, in case of refusal, to take him by force. This did\r\nnot avail Bagnato much, for the Roman Inquisition then wrote to the\r\nviceroy, asking to have the prisoner forwarded, which presumably was\r\ndone.[172]\r\n\r\nThere was in this merely an assertion of sovereignty and no desire to\r\nshield the heretic, for when the Inquisition accepted the inevitable and\r\nmade application to the viceroy, it was granted almost as a matter of\r\ncourse. The formality was simple. The application was referred to the\r\nchief chaplain, who made a show of consulting with the judges of the\r\nAudiencia and reported that it was in due form, when the exequatur was\r\ngranted. Occasionally, however, some question might be raised when the\r\nprocess called attention to some abusive extension of inquisitorial\r\njurisdiction. Thus in 1610 a certain Fabio Orzolino asked for the\r\nexequatur on a citation which he had obtained directed to the Abate\r\nAngelo and Carlo della Rocca of Traetto (Gaeta). On this the chief\r\nchaplain reported that the parties owed to Orzolino 88 ducats, for\r\nnon-payment of which they had been publicly excommunicated. Under this\r\nexcommunication they had lain for a year, which, according to the canon\r\nlaw, rendered them suspect of heresy and thus, by a strained\r\nconstruction, subjected them to inquisitorial action. It is not easy to\r\nunderstand the decision of the chaplain that the exequatur should be\r\ngranted as to the abate and not as to the layman.[173] A more wholesome\r\ncase was one in 1574, shown in the application of Giovanni Tomase,\r\nModesto Abate and Sebastiano Luca for an exequatur to the order of the\r\nRoman Inquisition to sell the property of Nicola Pegna and Giovanni\r\nMateo of Tagio, to reimburse the applicants for expenses amounting to\r\n338 crowns arising from false accusations of heresy brought against them\r\nby Pegna and Mateo, who had been condemned for false-witness to\r\nscourging in Rome, with the addition of the galleys for Mateo.[174]\r\n\r\nUnder this system the Roman Inquisition had a tolerably free hand in\r\nNaples and its arrests were sufficiently numerous for it to establish a\r\nregular service of vessels to carry its prisoners, transportation by sea\r\nbeing much more economical than by land. The latter was expensive, as we\r\nchance to learn from a letter of March 8, 1586, ordering Captain Amoroso\r\nto be forwarded by land because the tempestuous weather prevented\r\nvessels from putting to sea. He was to have a guard of six soldiers who\r\nwere to bring back a certificate of his delivery to the Inquisition, and\r\nthe expenses of the journey were to be defrayed from the property of the\r\nprisoner.[175] The sea service, however, was not without its risks.\r\nWhen, in 1593, Fray Gerónimo Gracian, the disciple of Santa Teresa, left\r\nNaples for Rome, it was on a _fragata de la Inquisicion_, which is\r\ndescribed as well provided with chains and shackles for securing\r\nprisoners. It chanced to be captured by the Moors and Gracian narrowly\r\nescaped burning, as he was supposed to be an inquisitor.[176]\r\n\r\nStill Rome was not satisfied with this and it found Viceroy Osuna\r\n(1582-86) obsequious to its exigencies. About 1585 he allowed Sixtus V\r\nto establish in Naples a regular Commissioner of the Inquisition, with\r\njurisdiction practically superseding that of the archbishop. By this\r\ntime the spirit of the Neapolitans had been effectually broken. Already,\r\nin 1580, the Venetian envoy Alvise Lando, in describing how they had\r\nbeen subdued by the universal misery attendant on the Spanish\r\ndomination, especially under the vice-royalty of the Marquis of Mondéjar\r\n(1575-79), adds that it is the opinion of many that if the king chose to\r\nestablish the Inquisition, so greatly abhorred, there would be little\r\nopposition.[177] How speedily under these circumstances the episcopal\r\nfunctions became atrophied is illustrated by a case occurring in 1592.\r\nIn 1590 a French youth named Jacques Girard was captured by a Barbary\r\ncorsair, circumcised and forced to embrace Islam. In 1592 he was sent on\r\nshore in Calabria with a boat’s crew to procure water, when he escaped\r\nand, being taken for a Moor, was thrown in prison at Cosenza. He applied\r\nto the archbishop for reconciliation to the Church; the prelate felt\r\nunable to act, even in so simple a matter, and wrote to the Roman\r\nInquisition for instructions. Before these came, Jacques had been\r\ntransferred to Naples; a second application was made to Rome and the\r\nnecessary powers were sent to the Archbishop of Naples, with orders to\r\nreport the result.[178] So, in the trial for heresy of the celebrated\r\nFra Tommaso Campanella, in 1600, Clement VIII designated as a court his\r\nnuncio at Naples, the archiepiscopal vicar and the Bishop of Termoli,\r\nand they were to transmit to Rome a summary of the case, with their\r\nopinions, before rendering sentence.[179]\r\n\r\nUnder such a viceroy as Osuna, the inquisitorial commissioner was\r\nsuperfluous, for all the powers of the state were put at the disposition\r\nof the papal representatives. As early as 1582 we find the nuncio\r\nassuming jurisdiction and requesting Osuna to execute a sentence of\r\nscourging which he had passed on the Venetian Giulio Secamonte for\r\nsuspicion of heresy, a request which was promptly granted. The Roman\r\nInquisition had only to ask for the arrest of any one throughout the\r\nkingdom, when immediately orders were given to the local authorities to\r\nseize him and send him to Naples for transmission to Rome, and if\r\nnecessary to take possession of and forward all his books and papers.\r\nFrom this the highest in the land were not secure. In 1583 Cardinal\r\nSavelli, then secretary of the Inquisition, wrote that the person of\r\nPrince Gianbattista Spinello was wanted in Rome to answer for matters of\r\nfaith, when immediately Osuna issued orders to seize him wherever he\r\nmight be found and bring him to the Royal Audiencia, where he was to\r\ngive security in 25,000 ducats to present himself within a month to the\r\nHoly Office and not to leave Rome without its permission.[180]\r\n\r\nOsuna’s successor, Juan de Zuñiga, Count of Miranda, was equally\r\nsubservient, but he insisted on the observance of the formalities when\r\nRome sought to act independently without vice-regal intervention. In\r\n1587, at the order of Cardinal Savelli, the Apostolic Vicar of Lecce\r\ninduced the Audiencia of the Terra d’Otranto to arrest Giantonio Stomeo.\r\nThis was overslaughing the viceroy who rebuked the Audiencia, telling it\r\nthat it should have referred the matter to him and awaited his\r\ninstructions, meanwhile assuring itself of the person of the individual.\r\nIt was purely a matter of etiquette for, in the end, after some further\r\ncorrespondence, Miranda ordered Stomeo to be forwarded to Naples by the\r\nfirst chain (of galley slaves), giving advices so that arrangements\r\ncould be made for his transmission to Rome. There seems to have been\r\nsome doubt as to the correctness of the stand taken by Miranda for\r\nsubsequently Annibale Moles, Regent of the Vicaria, was called upon for\r\na consulta in which he stated the rule to be that arrests for the\r\nInquisition must always pass through the hands of the viceroy, who\r\nalways ordered their execution.[181]\r\n\r\nRome was not satisfied with this and continued its encroachments, taking\r\nadvantage of any weakness of the civil power to establish precedents and\r\nclaim them as rights. In 1628 we find it represented by the Dominican\r\nFra Giacinto Petronio, Bishop of Molfetta, who styled himself inquisitor\r\nand was especially audacious in extending his powers. He arrested Dr.\r\nTomas Calendrino, a Sicilian, because he assisted in the escape from\r\nBenevento of a contumacious person. He was carried to the Archbishop of\r\nNaples and placed on the papal galleys for transmission to Rome, but the\r\nNeapolitan spirit was rising again and the Collaterale and Junta de\r\nJurisdicion called on Viceroy Alba to demand his surrender under threat\r\nof not allowing the galleys to depart and of banishing Fra Petronio\r\nwithin 24 hours. Alba however conferred with the nuncio and archbishop,\r\nwho assured him that it was customary to arrest and send people to Rome\r\nwithout notice to him. In this perplexity Alba referred the matter to\r\nhis master Philip IV, who warmly praised his prudence in so doing. The\r\npapal nuncio at Madrid, he said, had received orders from Rome to\r\nprotest against the attempted innovation of requiring notice to the\r\nviceroy and he therefore ordered Alba, as the matter was of the highest\r\nimportance, to investigate precedents of persons arrested with or\r\nwithout notice, and not to introduce any novelty. What was the ultimate\r\nresult as respects Calendrino does not appear, but this nerveless way of\r\ntreating the matter was not calculated to check the insolence of Fra\r\nPetronio who, in the course of the affair, excommunicated the judges\r\nCalefano and Osorio, summoned the auditor Figueroa to present himself to\r\nthe Roman Inquisition and finally arrested him with his own armed\r\nsbirri. This was no novelty, for he had no scruple in imprisoning and\r\nmaltreating royal officials for executing orders of the government.[182]\r\n\r\nPhilip was accustomed to allow his own officials to be thus abused by\r\nthe Spanish Inquisition, but the Neapolitan temper was stubborn and, in\r\n1630, the Collaterale reminded Fra Petronio that all commissions to\r\narrest required the exequatur; it ordered him to present within three\r\ndays all that he had received from Rome, and moreover forbade him to\r\nkeep armed retainers. It made complaints to the king and to the Spanish\r\nambassador at Rome, while Urban VIII issued briefs defending him, under\r\nwhich encouragement he continued his arbitrary methods. At length\r\nPhilip, by a letter of March 18, 1631, ordered that no papal brief\r\nshould be executed without the exequatur; a new viceroy, the Count of\r\nMonterey, was prompted to defend the royal jurisdiction and Fra Petronio\r\ncomplained to Rome that the aid of the secular arm was withheld unless\r\nhe would state the names of those whom he desired to imprison. The pope\r\nappealed to Philip IV, who apparently had forgotten about the matter\r\nand, in a letter of November 27, 1632, asked for explanations. Then Fra\r\nPetronio commenced taking evidence against the auditor Brandolino, but\r\nwhen the Collaterale deliberated, January 31, 1633, on a proposition to\r\nbanish him, he yielded. Monterey negotiated with Rome to have him\r\nreplaced with some one less objectionable and also that the new\r\nincumbent should not hold a tribunal but should only report to the\r\nCongregation the cases occurring. Urban VIII offered to appoint any one\r\nwhom they might select, and when the name was presented of Antonio\r\nRicciullo, Bishop of Belcastro, then their ambassador at Rome, he was\r\nduly commissioned.[183]\r\n\r\nThere was nothing gained by the change. Ricciullo styled himself\r\ninquisitor-general; he held a tribunal and in his time condemned four\r\nclerics for functioning without priest’s orders--three strangled and\r\nburnt in public, and one strangled privately. The pope ordered that the\r\nDominican convent should serve as an inquisitorial prison and its prior\r\nshould be a consultor, and thus after a struggle of nearly a century the\r\npapal Inquisition was fairly established in Naples.[184]\r\n\r\nRicciullo died, May 17, 1642, and was succeeded by Felice Tamburello,\r\nBishop of Sora. He died in 1656 and was replaced temporarily by the\r\nnuncio Giulio Spinola, who served until 1659, when Camillo Piazza,\r\nBishop of Dragona was appointed. That Naples should be impatient at\r\nfinding itself thus gradually and imperceptibly brought under the yoke\r\nof the papal Inquisition was natural. The turbulent city had gallantly\r\nresisted, at no little cost to itself, the imposition of the Spanish\r\nHoly Office, through times in which unity of faith was seriously\r\nthreatened by successive heresies. Now all such danger was past. There\r\nwere no Cathari or Waldenses or Protestants to rend in Italy the\r\nseamless garment of the Church and the period was one of spiritual\r\napathy, wholly averse to proselytism. Only the unappeasable longing of\r\nRome to make its power manifest everywhere could explain its persistence\r\nin thus insinuating the abhorred jurisdiction in a city which prided\r\nitself on its piety, on the number of churches and convents which\r\nimpoverished it, on the obedience of the people to the priesthood and on\r\nthe strictness of its religious observance. The only field of\r\ninquisitorial activity lay in reckless speeches which might savor of\r\nirreligion, in the blasphemy through which anger or despair found\r\nexpression, in the superstitious arts of wise-women, in burning clerics\r\nwho administered sacraments without having received the requisite orders\r\nand in such offences as bigamy and seduction in the confessional, all of\r\nwhich could only by a strained construction be deemed as savoring of\r\nheresy, and could readily be disposed of by the ordinary spiritual or\r\nsecular courts. The Holy Office was a manifest superfluity and its\r\nimposition was all the more galling.\r\n\r\nNor was there any alleviation in the fact that the tribunal was papal\r\nand not Spanish, for there was nothing to choose between them, in spite\r\nof frequent appeals to the pledge of Philip II that the _via ordinaria_\r\nalone should be observed. There were the same confiscation and\r\nimpoverishment of families. There were the same travesty of justice and\r\ndenial of rightful defence to the accused. There were the same secrecy\r\nof procedure and withholding from the prisoner the names of his accuser\r\nand of the witnesses. There was the same readiness to accept the\r\ndenunciations and testimony of the vilest, who could be heard in no\r\nother court, but who, in the Inquisition, could gratify malignity,\r\nsecure that they would remain unknown. There was even greater freedom in\r\nthe use of torture, as the habitual solvent of all doubts, whether as to\r\nfact or intention. There were the same prolonged and heartbreaking\r\ndelays during which the accused was secluded from all communication with\r\nthe outside world. A careless speech overheard and distorted by an\r\nenemy--or perhaps invented by him--sufficed to cast a man into the\r\nsecret prison, where he might lie for four or five years, while his\r\ntrial proceeded leisurely and his family might starve. It would probably\r\nend in his torture, to make him confess if he denied the utterance, or\r\nto ascertain his intention if he admitted and sought to explain it. If\r\nhe succumbed in the torture he was subjected to a humiliating penance,\r\nto wearing the habitello and to infamy--probably also to confiscation.\r\nIf his endurance in the torture-chamber enabled him to “purge the\r\nevidence,” as the legists phrased it, he was discharged with a verdict\r\nof not proven, with nothing to make amends for his sufferings and wasted\r\nyears. Such was the fate which hung over every citizen and it was felt\r\nacutely.[185] How little was required to arouse inquisitorial vigilance\r\nwas shown in 1683, when Agostino Mazza, a priest employed in teaching\r\nphilosophy, was thrown in prison by the Commissioner of the Inquisition\r\nand humiliated by having to abjure in public two abstract propositions\r\nwhich to the ordinary mind have the least possible bearing on the\r\nfaith--“The definition of man is not that he is a reasoning animal” and\r\n“Brutes have a kind of imperfect reason.”[186] The human intellect\r\nevidently had small chance of development under such conditions.\r\n\r\nIt is easy therefore to understand the growing uneasiness of the people\r\nwhen they saw the commissioner, Monsignor Piazza, appointed in 1659,\r\ngradually erect a formal inquisitorial tribunal, with a fiscal and other\r\ncustomary officials and a corps of armed familiars, recruited, as we\r\nare told, from the lowest class of the population. His activity was such\r\nthat he constructed eight prisons in as many convents, where even women\r\nwere confined, without respect to rank or condition, under the\r\nguardianship of the _frati._ He celebrated _atti di fede_ in public,\r\nwhere abjurations were administered, followed by scourgings through the\r\nstreets, and he levied on the resources of the Regular Orders to defray\r\nthe expenses of his court. Indignation gathered and, on April 2, 1661,\r\nthe Piazze ordered their representative body, the Capitolo di San\r\nLorenzo, to consider the innovations of the commissioner. The aspect of\r\nthe people grew threatening and Count Peñaranda, the viceroy, ordered\r\nMonsignor Piazza to leave the kingdom, which he did on April 10th, under\r\nescort of a troop of horse to assure his safety. This did not appease\r\nthe deputies who, on May 18th, presented a memorial to the viceroy, in\r\nwhich they further drew attention to the subject of confiscation and\r\nasked that the prohibitory bull of Julius III, in 1554, should be\r\nenforced. Consultations and negotiations were long continued during\r\nwhich discussion became so hot that Peñaranda threw some of the deputies\r\nin prison, but, on October 24th, he announced that Philip IV had decided\r\nthat the grant of Philip II must be maintained and the _via ordinaria_\r\nalone must be followed. Nothing was said as to the abandonment of\r\nconfiscation and efforts to procure it were protracted, but without\r\nsuccess.[187]\r\n\r\nIf the Neapolitans flattered themselves that they had obtained release\r\nfrom the odious institution, they were mistaken. Rome continued to send\r\ncommissioners and they continued to disregard the privileges of the\r\nkingdom. Another outbreak occurred in 1691 when, under orders from the\r\nRoman Congregation, its commissioner--Giovanni Giberti, Bishop of\r\nCava--seized several persons without obtaining the exequatur of the\r\nviceroy. The Collaterale, or Council, notified him that there was no\r\nInquisition in Naples and that the prisoners must be transferred to the\r\narchiepiscopal prison, under pain of legal proceedings against him. He\r\ntreated with contempt the notary who bore this message and threatened\r\nhim with the savage penalties provided for impeding the Inquisition, in\r\nresponse to which the Collaterale hustled him out of the kingdom, barely\r\nallowing him time to perform quarantine at Gaeta. Innocent XII felt this\r\nkeenly, for he was a Neapolitan and had been Archbishop of Naples, and a\r\nwarm correspondence ensued with the Spanish court. It was claimed by the\r\ncuria that the pope was omnipotent in matters of faith; that he could\r\nabrogate local laws and enact new ones at his pleasure, while the papal\r\nnuncio at Madrid warned the king that Naples would be given over to\r\natheism without the Inquisition and the whole vast monarchy of Spain\r\nmight be destroyed. The city of Naples was equally vigorous in asserting\r\nits rights and complained of the numerous officials of the commissioner,\r\nexempted from secular jurisdiction and committing scandals with\r\nimpunity. The pope threatened an interdict and the Piazze threatened to\r\nrise; the latter danger was to Carlos II the most imminent and, in 1692,\r\nhe prohibited all further residence in Naples of papal delegates or\r\ncommissioners. To render secure the fruits of this victory, the Piazze\r\ntook the decided step of appointing a permanent deputation whose duty it\r\nwas to guard the city from further dangers of the same nature.[188]\r\n\r\nIf again the good people of Naples imagined that they had at last shaken\r\noff the dreaded Holy Office they underrated the persistence of Rome.\r\nTrials for heresy continued in the archiepiscopal court, conducted in\r\ninquisitorial fashion and not by the _via ordinaria_. This caused\r\nrenewed dissatisfaction and, in hopes of reaching some terms of\r\naccommodation, envoys were sent to Rome in 1693 to ask that the\r\nprocedure should be open, the names of the witnesses and the testimony\r\nbeing communicated to the accused; that no one should be imprisoned\r\nwithout competent proof against him; that the city should be allowed to\r\nsupply an advocate for the poor and that two lay assistants should be\r\nappointed to see that these provisions were enforced. Prolonged\r\ndiscussions followed, the cardinals entrusted with the matter seeking to\r\ngain readmission for the commissioner and arguing that the bishops were\r\nmostly unfit to exercise the jurisdiction.[189] There was little\r\nprospect of reaching an agreement when Naples was startled with a wholly\r\nnovel aggression. February 1, 1695, there was published in Rome by the\r\nInquisition an Edict of Denunciation which, under its orders, was\r\nsimilarly published in at least one of the Neapolitan dioceses. Such\r\nedicts were issued annually in Spain, but in Naples they were unknown\r\nand the present one was evidently intended for that kingdom, for it\r\nincluded the episcopal ordinaries as well as inquisitors, as the parties\r\nto whom every one was required, under pain of excommunication _latæ\r\nsententiæ_, removable only by the Inquisition, and other penalties, to\r\ndenounce whatever cases might come in any way to his cognizance, of a\r\nlist of offences ranging from apostasy to bigamy, blasphemy and sorcery.\r\nThe Deputati took the matter up in a long memorial addressed to the\r\nCollaterale, pointing out the invasion of the prerogative in publishing\r\nthe edict without the necessary exequatur and the evils to be expected\r\nfrom converting the population into spies and creating a universal\r\nfeeling of insecurity. There was also the fact that the edict assumed\r\nthe jurisdiction of the Inquisition over Naples, that it made the\r\nbishops its agents, authorized as its deputies to employ the\r\ninquisitorial process, and that it comprised not only offences which the\r\nNeapolitans contended to belong to the secular courts but a general\r\nclause, vaguely embracing whatever else might be claimed as subject to\r\nthe jurisdiction of the Holy Office.[190]\r\n\r\nThis shrewd device of the Roman Inquisition was successful. The bishops\r\nto a considerable extent exercised the powers delegated to them and the\r\nDeputati found constant occupation in endeavoring to protect those whom\r\nthey imprisoned and tried by inquisitorial methods. Then came the\r\ntroublous times of the War of Succession which followed the death of\r\nCarlos II in 1700. After a fruitless struggle Philip V was obliged to\r\nabandon Naples in 1707 to his rival, Charles of Austria, and during the\r\ninterval the Inquisition succeeded in re-introducing a commissioner, who\r\nmade free use of his powers. The new monarch sought to secure the\r\nloyalty of his subjects and from Barcelona sent orders to his viceroy,\r\nCardinal Grimani to support the Deputati in their efforts to uphold the\r\nprivileges of the kingdom. In spite of this the Deputati were obliged to\r\nappeal to him, in a petition of July 31, 1709, representing that, after\r\nthe publication of his despatch to Grimani, the ecclesiastics proceeded\r\nto the greatest imaginable oppressions and violence, so that their\r\ncondition was worse than ever, wherefore they prayed for relief at his\r\nhands, so that trials should be conducted in the _via ordinaria_. To\r\nthis Charles replied, September 15th, to Grimani, commanding that\r\nmatters of faith should be confined strictly to the bishops, to be\r\nhandled by the _via ordinaria_; any departure from this was to be\r\nseverely punished and the authorities were to use the whole royal power,\r\nthrough whatever means were necessary, for the enforcement of his\r\norders.[191]\r\n\r\nThis won as little obedience as the previous royal utterance and the\r\nDeputati were kept busy in attending to the cases of those who suffered\r\nfrom the persistent employment of inquisitorial methods--efforts which\r\nwere sometimes successful but more frequently in vain. It was probably\r\nsome special outrage that induced the Deputati, in 1711, to employ\r\nNicolò Capasso to draw up a report on inquisitorial methods. The work is\r\na storehouse of inquisitorial principles as set forth by accredited\r\ninquisitorial authorities--papal decretals and manuals of practice such\r\nas those of Eymerich, Peña, Simancas, Albertino, Rojas, the Sacro\r\nArsenale etc., admirably calculated to excite abhorrence by laying bare\r\nthe complete denial of justice in every step of procedure, the pitiless\r\ncruelty of the system and the manner in which the lives, the fortunes\r\nand the honor of every citizen were at the mercy of the malignant and of\r\nthe temper of the tribunal. Yet so far from being an advocate of\r\ntoleration, Capasso commences by arguing against it at much length.\r\nReligion, he says, is the foundation of social order and the principle\r\nof toleration infers toleration of irreligion. Protestants are\r\nintolerant between themselves and the Catholic system cannot endure\r\ntoleration. That which is taught by the philosophers is chimerical, and\r\na community to be stable must be united in faith, but the enforcement of\r\nthis unity is a matter for the secular power. Punishment must be\r\ncorporal and the Church has authority over the spirit alone, not over\r\nthe body. An allusion to the _gravissime agitazioni_ of the people would\r\nindicate that his labors were called forth by some action which had\r\naroused especial resentment.[192]\r\n\r\nIt was all in vain. By the death of his brother Joseph I, Charles VI\r\nsucceeded to the empire in 1711. Wars and other interests diverted his\r\nattention from Naples and, though he consistently resisted the pressure\r\nfrom Rome to give the Inquisition recognition, the bishops continued to\r\nexercise inquisitorial jurisdiction in inquisitorial fashion. The\r\nDeputati did what they could, but the success of their efforts depended\r\nupon the uncertain temper of the successive imperial viceroys, who,\r\nthough they might sometimes manifest a spasmodic readiness to enforce\r\nthe royal decrees, did not countervail the persistent ecclesiastical\r\ndetermination to wield the power afforded by inquisitorial\r\nmethods.[193]\r\n\r\nA change was at hand when, in 1734, Carlo VII (better known as Carlos\r\nIII of Spain) drove the Austrians out of Naples and assumed the throne.\r\nThe kingdom, after two centuries of viceroyalties, at last had a\r\nresident monarch of its own, anxious to win the affection of his new\r\nsubjects and inclined, as his subsequent career showed, to curb\r\nexorbitant ecclesiastical pretensions. His royal oath included a pledge\r\nto observe the privileges of the land, including those concerning the\r\nInquisition granted by his predecessor. Apparently for some years there\r\nwas hesitation in testing the quality of the new régime, but in 1738 and\r\n1739, as though by concerted action under orders from Rome, Cardinal\r\nSpinelli, the Archbishop of Naples, and various bishops throughout the\r\nkingdom, undertook prosecutions in the prohibited fashion. Complaints\r\nreached the Deputati, who appealed to the king. He reproached them for\r\nnegligence, ordered the proceedings stopped and the processes to be sent\r\nto Naples, and gave to Spinelli a warning that such irregularities would\r\nnot be permitted. Undeterred by this, the episcopal Inquisition\r\ncontinued at work and in 1743 three bishops, of Nusco, Ortono and\r\nCassano, were called to account; the papers of trials held by them were\r\nexamined and pronounced irregular; in one case the Bishop of Nusco had\r\ncruelly tortured a parish priest named Gaetano de Arco, after holding\r\nhim in prison for eight months.[194]\r\n\r\nIt seems incredible that under such circumstances ecclesiastical\r\npersistence should defiantly call public attention to its disregard of\r\nthe laws, yet on September 26, 1746, the octave of San Gennaro--a time\r\nwhen the popular afflux to the churches was greatest--an _atto di fede_,\r\nconducted according to inquisitorial practice, was celebrated in the\r\narchiepiscopal church, where a Sicilian priest named Antonio Nava\r\nabjured certain errors and was condemned to perpetual irremissible\r\nprison. Popular indignation was aroused, the cry arose that Spinelli was\r\nendeavoring to introduce the Inquisition and he was insulted in his\r\ncarriage by crowds as he drove through the streets. The Deputati\r\nrepresented to the king that they had been appealed to by three\r\nprisoners whose trials were not conducted by the _via ordinaria_,\r\nshowing that the ecclesiastics were seeking to impose the abhorred\r\nInquisition on the kingdom. Spinelli protested that the trials were open\r\nand according to the _via ordinaria_ and that he was ready to obey\r\nwhatever commands he might receive from the king. Carlos sent all the\r\npapers to his council, known as the Camera di Santa Chiara, with orders\r\nto investigate and report.\r\n\r\nThe Camera made a thorough examination and reported, December 19th, that\r\nNava had lain in prison since April, 1741; another prisoner, a layman\r\nnamed Trascogna, had been incarcerated for three years and his trial was\r\nyet unfinished; the third, a deacon named Angelo Petriello, was accused\r\nof celebrating mass on July 24th last and was about to put in his\r\ndefence. The archbishop argued that, unlike his predecessors, he did not\r\nconceal the witnesses’ names and therefore the process was the ordinary\r\none, but investigation showed that in other respects inquisitorial\r\npractice was followed and inquisitorial authorities were cited; during\r\nthe trial the prisoner was kept _incomunicado_ in his cell and debarred\r\nfrom all communication with the outside world. In the papers the\r\nexpression “Tribunale della Santa Fede” was constantly used; in the\r\nmarble lintel of the door leading to the rooms occupied by it the words\r\n“Sanctum Officium” were cut and the part of the prison used by it was\r\ncalled “del Sant’ Officio.” It had a full corps of special officials and\r\nin a passage-way there had been for five or six years a tablet bearing\r\ntheir names and positions, with the inscription “Inquisitori del\r\nTribunale del S. Uffizio.” It also had a seal different from that of the\r\ncourt of the Ordinary, bearing for device two hands, one of St. Peter\r\nwith the key, the other of St. Paul with a naked sword and the legend\r\n“Sanctum Officium Archiep. Neap.” The Camera thence concluded that it\r\nwas the old Inquisition under various devices and only awaiting an\r\nopportunity to establish itself openly, as was shown by the occurrences\r\nin 1691, 1711 and 1739 and, as it was impossible to place reliance on\r\nthe promises of ecclesiastics, so often made and broken, it advised that\r\nall the officials of the pretended Tribunal of Faith should be banished\r\nas disturbers of the public peace; the three processes should be sealed\r\nand filed away in the public archives, the accused should be restored to\r\ntheir original position and be tried again by the _via ordinaria_.\r\nEverything connected with the Tribunal should be abolished--officials,\r\nprison, seal and inscription--and notice be given that any one in future\r\nassuming such offices would incur the royal indignation. All spiritual\r\ncourts should be notified that, in actions of the faith against either\r\nclerics or laymen, before arrest the informations must be laid before\r\nthe king for his assent and before sentence the whole process, so as to\r\nmake sure that there were no irregularities. The accused while in prison\r\nmust have full liberty of writing and talking to whom he pleased and be\r\nfurnished with an advocate chosen by the Deputati or the Camera. To\r\nprotect the laity against prosecutions for simple sorcery or blasphemy\r\nor other matters not subject to spiritual jurisdiction, the nature of\r\nthe alleged crime must be clearly expressed when applying for licence to\r\narrest.[195]\r\n\r\nThese suggestions were promptly adopted and were embodied in a royal\r\ndecree of December 29th, by which two of the officials were banished\r\nwithin eight days and similar punishment was threatened for any future\r\nattempt to exercise such functions. By January 5, 1747, the Marchese\r\nBrancone, under royal order, was able to report to the Deputati that the\r\nseal and commissions had been surrendered, the inscription over the door\r\nhad been changed to “Archivium” and the name of the prison altered to\r\nprisons of S. Francesco and S. Paolo. Archbishop Spinelli was compelled\r\nto resign and, when Benedict XIV sent Cardinal Landi to Naples to seek\r\nsome method of re-establishing the tribunal, he was in danger of being\r\nmobbed and was obliged to return without having secured an official\r\naudience. Thus the Inquisition ceased to have a recognized existence in\r\nNaples; the rejoicing was general and, as an expression of its\r\ngratitude, the city made a voluntary offering to Carlos of three hundred\r\nthousand ducats. Yet the Deputati did not disband; taught by past\r\nexperience they kept vigilant watch to see that the detested institution\r\nor its methods were not smuggled in and that the ecclesiastical courts\r\nobserved the new rules. Carlos was called to the throne of Spain in\r\n1759, by the death of his half-brother Fernando VI, leaving Naples to\r\nhis young son, Ferdinando IV. Possibly it may have been thought that\r\nduring a minority there was an opportunity to revive the institution\r\nfor, in 1761, the Deputati made an appeal to the king. The Regent\r\nTanucci was not a man to relinquish the advantage gained. The decree of\r\n1746 was again sent to all prelates with commands that it be strictly\r\nobeyed and the royal thanks were conveyed to the Deputati for their\r\nvigilance, which they were ordered not to relax.[196]\r\n\r\nThey heeded the injunction and, in 1764, they addressed to the king a\r\nmemorial on the case of Padre Leopoldo di S. Pasquale, a Bare-footed\r\nAugustinian, who had been tried by his brethren on charges of financial\r\nirregularities and unchastity. Inquisitorial procedure had been\r\nemployed, no opportunity for defence had been allowed and, for seven\r\nyears, the unfortunate friar had been subjected by his superiors to a\r\nseries of inhuman cruelties.[197] What was the result I have no means of\r\nascertaining, but this prolonged vigilance indicates the profound and\r\nenduring impression entertained of the Inquisition by the Neapolitans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nSARDINIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the island of Sardinia was a possession of the crown of Aragon, it\r\nwas not neglected in organizing the Inquisition. There were Conversos\r\nthere and doubtless in the earliest period it served as a refuge for\r\nsome of those who fled from Spain. The introduction of the Holy Office\r\nis probably to be attributed to the year 1492, when Micer Sancho Maria\r\nwas appointed inquisitor.[198] He served until 1497, for a letter of\r\nDecember 15th of that year, from Ferdinand to Miguel Fonte, receiver of\r\nSardinia, recites that the inquisitors-general have appointed Maestre\r\nGabriel Cardona, rector of Peñiscola, as inquisitor in place of Sancho\r\nMarin, transferred to Sicily, and it proceeds to give instructions as to\r\nsalaries, from which we learn that the organization was on a most\r\neconomical scale. There was, as yet, no settled habitation for it, as a\r\nletter of March 11, 1498, to Don Pero Mata requests him to let Cardona\r\ncontinue in occupation of his house, as Marin had been, and one of\r\nSeptember 24, 1500, orders that quarters be rented in Cagliari where all\r\nthe officials can lodge together. There was but one inquisitor, with an\r\nassessor, no fiscal, one alguazil, a single notary to serve both in the\r\ntribunal and for the confiscations, and a receiver, with salaries too\r\nmodest to offer much temptation to serve in an inhospitable land, where\r\nthe principal occupation seems to be quarrelling with all the other\r\nauthorities.[199] In fact the Inquisition was as unpopular in Sardinia\r\nas elsewhere, for Ferdinand, in announcing to his lieutenant-general\r\nthe appointment of Cardona, feels it necessary to order that he and his\r\nsubordinates shall receive more favor than their predecessors, so that\r\nthey may freely exercise their functions; they are not to be ill-treated\r\nby any one, nor be impeded in the performance of their duties. Ferdinand\r\nhad heard how his lieutenant-general took certain wheat out of the hands\r\nof the receiver, resulting in the loss of a hundred and sixty libras,\r\nwherefore he is ordered in future to abstain from interference in such\r\nmatters, as otherwise due provision will be made to prevent him.[200]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these royal injunctions, Cardona was not long in\r\nbecoming involved in a bitter quarrel with both the secular and\r\necclesiastical authorities. It appears from a series of Ferdinand’s\r\nletters, September 18, 1498, that a certain Domingo de Santa Cruz--who\r\nten years before had been the cause of similar trouble in Valencia--was\r\nimprisoned by the inquisitor and forcibly released by the\r\nlieutenant-general and the Archbishop of Cagliari, who claimed that, in\r\nfurtherance of the king’s interests, they had given him a safe-conduct.\r\nThe archbishop, moreover, had withdrawn from Cardona a commission\r\nenabling him to exercise the episcopal jurisdiction, the coöperation of\r\nwhich was requisite in all judgements. Ferdinand writes in great wrath;\r\nhe instructs the inquisitor to reclaim Domingo at once, to throw him in\r\nchains and hold him until the royal pleasure is known; if the\r\nlieutenant-general and archbishop resist, he is to proceed against them\r\nwith excommunication; the latter are roundly scolded and ordered to\r\nsurrender the prisoner and hereafter to support the inquisitor and the\r\narchbishop is told to renew the episcopal commission. Not content with\r\nthis, the king orders the viguier of Cagliari, under pain of dismissal\r\nfrom office, to obey the commands of the inquisitor and similar\r\ninstructions are sent to the town-council.[201] The inquisitor thus was\r\nmade the virtual autocrat of the island, but his triumph was\r\nevanescent, for on November 15, 1499, we find him in Ferdinand’s court\r\nat Avila and his salary ceases on that day. He evidently left Sardinia\r\nin undignified haste and involved in trouble, for a royal cédula of\r\nNovember 18th commands the governor and other officials, under penalty\r\nof the royal wrath and of a thousand florins, to allow the furniture,\r\nbooks, bedding and personal effects of the late inquisitor Cardona to be\r\nfreely shipped to him.[202] Nine months elapsed before the vacancy was\r\nfilled by the commission of the Bishop of Bonavalle, August 18, 1500, to\r\nwhom was granted the power of appointing and dismissing his assessor and\r\nnotary--the two officials on whom, as Ferdinand tells him, the success\r\nor failure of the Inquisition chiefly depends.[203]\r\n\r\nIt is quite possible that Cardona’s precipitate departure may have been\r\nmotived by terror for, about that time, the receiver, Miguel Fonte, was\r\nassassinated in Cagliari, as we may assume, by some of those whom he had\r\nreduced to poverty. He was not killed on the spot; from letters of\r\nFebruary 13, 1500, we learn that he had been carried to Barcelona, in\r\nhopes of cure, and died there. Ferdinand ordered that his widow should\r\nbe treated with all consideration and that the lieutenant-general should\r\npursue and punish the assassins. Sympathy seems rather to have been with\r\nthe criminals and the royal commands were disregarded, under the\r\nfrivolous pretext that it was the business of the Inquisition--a\r\npalpable falsehood, seeing that the tribunal was vacant--for which\r\nFerdinand took his representative severely to task on August 18th. The\r\nreceivership had also remained unoccupied, ‘for it was not until August\r\n4th that a fit person could be found, venturesome enough to tempt its\r\ndangers, in the person of Juan López, a merchant of Játiva.[204]\r\n\r\nIt may well be that there was wide-spread hatred felt for the receiver\r\nof confiscations, for the correspondence of the period shows that\r\npersecution had been fairly productive, considering the poverty of the\r\nisland. August 29, 1497, there is an order to pay the royal secretary\r\nCalcena, out of the property of Antoni Cones, a debt claimed by him of a\r\nhundred ducats, before any other creditors are paid. Then, on January\r\n21, 1498, a servant of the royal household, Mosen Gaspar Gilaberte,\r\nreceives a gratuity of twenty thousand sueldos (833-1/3 ducats) out of\r\nthe confiscation of Juan Soller of Cagliari. On March 11th we hear of a\r\ncomposition, made by request of the Archbishop and Syndic of Cagliari,\r\nwhereby the representatives of certain deceased persons, condemned by\r\nMicer Morin, compounded for the confiscation of their property--an\r\nagreement subsequently violated by Morin, whereupon the Dean of Cagliari\r\nand other prominent persons appealed to Ferdinand. Then, October 14th,\r\nthere is an _ayuda de costa_ to the notary Bernat Ros to refund his\r\nexpenses on a journey to the court and back. Then, October 12, 1499,\r\nthere is a gratuity of two hundred and fifty ducats to Alonso Castillo,\r\nservant of Don Enrique Enriquez, royal mayordomo mayor. Soon after this\r\nCardona, in hurrying to the court from Sardinia, brings five hundred\r\nducats to the royal treasury. During 1500 the disorganization of the\r\ntribunal cut off receipts but, in June, 1501, we hear of six hundred and\r\nfifty ducats given to the nuns of Santa Engracia of Saragossa. In 1502\r\nthere were found some pearls among the effects of Micer Rejadel,\r\ncondemned for heresy, and these Ferdinand ordered to be sent to him,\r\ncovered by insurance and, in due time, on July 17th, he acknowledged\r\ntheir receipt, fifty-five in number, weighing’ one ounce and one eighth\r\nand nine grains, after which they doubtless graced the toilet of Queen\r\nIsabella. At the same time he warned Juan López, the receiver, to be\r\ncareful, for there were many complaints coming in as to his methods of\r\nprocedure. Some months before this, in February, Ferdinand had\r\ncomplimented the inquisitor on the increased activity of his tribunal\r\nand had urged him to be especially watchful as to the confiscations, so\r\nthat nothing might be lost through official negligence. To assist in\r\nthe enlarged business thus expected, he promised to appoint a _juez de\r\nlos bienes_, or judge of confiscations.[205]\r\n\r\nAmid this eagerness to profit by the misery which he was creating it is\r\npleasant to find instances of Ferdinand’s kindliness in special cases.\r\nThus, January 12, 1498, in the matter of the confiscated estate of Joan\r\nAndrés of Cagliari, he releases to Beatriz de Torrellas, sister and heir\r\nof Don Francisco Torrellas, because she is noble and poor and her\r\nbrother had served him, a debt of 59-2/3 ducats due by Don Francisco to\r\nAndrés, which of course Beatriz would have had to pay. A few weeks\r\nlater, on February 4th, he alleges clemency and charity as his motive\r\nfor foregoing the confiscation of certain houses in Cagliari, belonging\r\nto Belenguer Oluja and his wife, both penanced for heresy. October 14th\r\nof the same year he takes pity on Na Thomasa, the wife of Joan Andrés,\r\nwho had been penanced when her husband was condemned; as she is reduced\r\nto beggary and has an old mother to support and two young girls of her\r\ndead sister, he orders the receiver to give her fifty ducats in charity.\r\nThis same estate of Joan Andrés gave occasion to another act of\r\nliberality, February 8, 1502, in releasing to the Hospital of San\r\nAntonio a _censal_ of sixty libras principal, due by it to the\r\nestate.[206] Trivial as are these cases, they are worth recording, if\r\nonly for the insight which they afford on the ramifications through\r\nwhich confiscation spread misery throughout the land.\r\n\r\nThe season of prosperous confiscations seems to have speedily passed\r\naway and the Sardinian tribunal proved to be a source of more trouble\r\nthan profit. It is true that, in 1512, Ferdinand derived a momentary\r\nsatisfaction from it, when he learned that a certain Miguel Sánchez del\r\nRomero, who had been condemned and burnt in effigy in Saragossa, had\r\nescaped to the island, where the lieutenant-general had taken him into\r\nfavor and made him viguier of Sassari. He promptly ordered the\r\ninquisitor to seize him secretly at once and send him, under charge of\r\nhis alguazil, to Saragossa, by the first vessel and, at the same time,\r\nhe notified the lieutenant-general that any impediment offered would be\r\npunished with deprivation of office, confiscation of property and\r\nexcommunication by the inquisitor.[207] This exhibition of vigor,\r\nhowever, did not serve to put the tribunal on an efficient basis;\r\nFerdinand was becoming thoroughly dissatisfied and, in August, 1514, he\r\ntried the expedient of appointing as inquisitor Juan de Loaysa, Bishop\r\nof Alghero, at the other end of the island from Cagliari, without\r\nremoving the existing inquisitor, Canon Aragall, but rendering him\r\nsubordinate to the bishop, whose place of residence was to be the seat\r\nof the tribunal. It is significant of the decadent condition of affairs\r\nthat Bernat Ros, who had become the receiver of confiscations, sent in\r\nhis resignation, on the plea of ill-health, and that Ferdinand refused\r\nto accept it unless he would find some one to take his place. Presumably\r\nthe trouble was that the harvest of confiscations had been gathered and\r\nspent, without making investments that would give the tribunal an\r\nassured income, and that the financial prospects were gloomy. Ferdinand\r\nrealized this and his zeal for the faith was insufficient to lead him to\r\nassume the responsibility. He made out a new schedule of salaries on an\r\nabsurdly low basis, amounting, for the whole tribunal, to only three\r\nhundred and thirty libras, telling the receiver that, if the receipts\r\nwere insufficient, the salaries must be cut down to a sueldo in the\r\nlibra for he did not propose to be in any way responsible.[208] The\r\ninstitution was to be self-supporting, which was perhaps the best way to\r\nstimulate its activity but, if this were the object, it was scarce\r\nsuccessful for, in January, 1515, Ferdinand writes that the baile of the\r\nisland, in whose house the Inquisition was quartered, is about to return\r\nhome and wants the house; as there is so little business and so few\r\nprisoners, it can get accommodation in the Dominican convent, which will\r\nserve the purpose. Loaysa’s term of office was short, for he was sent to\r\nRome as agent of the Spanish Inquisition, and the Bishop of Ales and\r\nTorrealba was appointed in his place. In announcing this to him, August\r\n28, 1515, Ferdinand significantly warns him not to meddle in matters\r\ndisconnected with the Holy Office.[209]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this palpable decadence, the Sardinian Inquisition\r\ncontinued to exist. It was in vain that, after Ferdinand’s death in\r\nJanuary, 1516, followed by that of Bishop Mercader, the\r\nInquisitor-general of Aragon, the people rejoiced in the expectation of\r\nits abandonment, for the representatives of Charles V, by a circular\r\nletter of August 30th to the lieutenant-general and the municipal\r\nauthorities, assured them that it would be continued and ordered them to\r\ntake measures for its increased activity, while the inquisitor was\r\ninformed that, although Sardinia was under the crown of Aragon, it was\r\nnot to enjoy the provisions of the Concordias to which Ferdinand had\r\nbeen obliged to assent at home.[210] Possibly the tribunal may have\r\nbecome more active but it was not more productive for, in 1522, the home\r\ntribunals were assessed for its support, Majorca being called upon for\r\ntwo hundred ducats and Barcelona and Saragossa for a hundred each.[211]\r\nAbout 1540, however, it seems to have discovered some well-to-do\r\nheretics, for we hear of its having three thousand ducats to invest in\r\ncensos.[212] This accession of wealth, however, does not argue that its\r\nfinancial management was better than was customary in the Inquisition\r\nfor, in 1544, a commission was sent to the Bishop of Alghero, the\r\ninquisitor, clothing him with full power to require from the receiver,\r\nPeroche de Salazar, a detailed account of his expenditures and his\r\nreceipts from fines, penances, commutations and rehabilitations, and to\r\ninvestigate all frauds, collusions and concealments, the terms of the\r\ncommission indicating that there had long been no check on\r\nembezzlements.[213]\r\n\r\nSuch prosperity as the tribunal enjoyed was spasmodic and it soon\r\nrelapsed into indigence. In 1577 we find the tribunal of Murcia ordered\r\nto pay two hundred ducats, arrearages of salary due to Martínez Villar,\r\nwho had been promoted, in 1569, from the inquisitorship to the\r\narchbishopric of Sassari[214] and, in 1588, Seville and Llerena were\r\neach called upon for 119,000 maravedís to repair an injustice committed\r\nby the Sardinia tribunal on María Malla--apparently it had spent the\r\nill-gotten money and was unable to make restitution.[215] In hopes of\r\nrelieving this poverty-stricken condition, Philip II, in 1580, appealed\r\nto Gregory XIII stating that it could not sustain itself and asking for\r\nassistance, which of course meant that canonries or other benefices\r\nshould be assigned to its support.[216] This appeal was unavailing for,\r\nin 1618, the Suprema represented to Philip III the deplorable condition\r\nof the tribunal, unable to defray the salaries of a single inquisitor, a\r\nfiscal, two secretaries and the minor officials; it urged him to obtain\r\nfrom the pope the suppression of canonries and meanwhile to meet its\r\nnecessities by the grant of some licences to export wheat and horses,\r\nwhich the pious monarch hastened to do.[217] This did not relieve the\r\nchronic poverty and, in 1658, Gregorio Cid, transferred to Cuenca after\r\nsix years and a half of service in Sardinia, represented to the\r\ninquisitor-general that the tribunal ought to have two inquisitors and a\r\nfiscal and that it was difficult to find any one to serve as a notary,\r\nfor the salary was small and expenses were great; besides, the climate\r\nwas so unhealthy that the tribunal often had to be closed in consequence\r\nof the sickness of the officials.[218]\r\n\r\nThe tribunal was evidently a superfluity, in so far as its legitimate\r\nfunctions were concerned, and we may assume that it was maintained not\r\nso much to deal with existing heretics as to prevent the island from\r\nbecoming an asylum for heresy. This could have been accomplished by\r\nstrengthening and stimulating the episcopal jurisdiction, but the\r\nInquisition had monopolized this and was jealous of all interference. In\r\n1538 Paul III addressed to the bishops and inquisitor of the island a\r\nbrief in which he recapitulated the provisions of the Council of Vienne\r\nrequiring them to coöperate and work in harmony; he urged the bishops to\r\nbe so active in repressing heresy that they should need no outside aid\r\nbut, if such should be necessary, the mandates of the council were to be\r\nobserved. The bishops apparently were not remiss in taking advantage of\r\nthis to revendicate the jurisdiction of which they had practically been\r\nstripped and the Inquisition resented the intrusion; Charles V must\r\nspeedily have made the pope sensible of his mistake for, in 1540, he\r\naddressed to the judges of the island another brief revoking the\r\nprevious one and reciting that the episcopal Ordinaries were interfering\r\nwith the functions of the inquisitors and must be restrained from\r\nimpeding or molesting them in any way by the liberal use of censures and\r\nthe invocation, if necessary, of the secular arm. This was not allowed\r\nto be a dead letter for, when in 1555 Salvator, Archbishop of Sassari,\r\nunder the brief of 1538, undertook to interfere with the tribunal, Paul\r\nIV, at the request of the emperor, promptly ordered the Bishops of\r\nAlghero, Suelli and Bosa to intervene and granted them the necessary\r\nfaculties to coerce him.[219]\r\n\r\nThe tribunal had little to show as the result of the jurisdiction so\r\neagerly monopolized. In fact, its chief industry consisted in\r\nmultiplying its nominal officials and familiars--positions sought for in\r\nconsequence of their privileges and immunities and doubtless liberally\r\npaid for. As early as 1552, Inquisitor-general Valdés rebuked Andreas\r\nSanna, Bishop of Ales and inquisitor, for the inordinate number of\r\nfamiliars and commissioners who obtained appointments for the purpose\r\nof enjoying the exemptions, and he ordered them reduced to the absolute\r\nneeds of the Holy Office.[220] This command was unheeded, the industry\r\nflourished and the principal activity of the tribunal lay in the\r\nresultant disputes with the secular courts. So recklessly did it\r\ndistribute its favors that, on one occasion, an enumeration in three\r\nvillages of Gallura disclosed no less than five hundred persons entitled\r\nto the privileges of the Holy Office. The consequences of this widely\r\ndistributed impunity were of course deplorable on both the peace and the\r\nmorals of the island.[221]\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances quarrels with the secular authorities were\r\nperpetual and inevitable and were conducted on both sides with a\r\nviolence attributable to the remoteness of the island and the little\r\nrespect felt by either party for the other. A specimen of the spirit\r\ndeveloped in these conflicts is afforded in a brief of Paul V, March 22,\r\n1617, to Inquisitor-general Sandoval y Rojas, complaining bitterly of a\r\nrecent outbreak in which the inquisitor excommunicated two officials and\r\nthe royal court ordered him to absolve them. On his refusal, the court\r\ncited him to appear and sentenced him to exile--a decree which was\r\npublished in Cagliari and elsewhere to sound of drum and trumpet. Then\r\nthe governor intervened in support of the court, treating the\r\ninquisitor, if we may believe the _ex parte_ statement, with\r\nunprecedented harshness. He broke into the Inquisition with an armed\r\nforce and ordered the inquisitor either to grant the absolutions or to\r\ngo on board of a vessel about to sail for Flanders and, on his refusal,\r\nhe was so maltreated as to be left almost lifeless on the floor. On a\r\nsecond intrusion he was found in bed with a fever; he still refused to\r\nembark and was left under guard, but he succeeded in escaping by a rope\r\nfrom a window and took asylum in the Dominican church, whither the\r\ngovernor followed him and seized him while celebrating mass, with the\r\nsacrament in his hands. This time he was kept in secure custody until he\r\ngave bonds to sail, after which, in fear of the voyage, he submitted\r\nand absolved the excommunicates. Paul summoned the governor and his\r\naccomplices to appear in Rome and undergo the penalty of their offences,\r\nbut it may be doubted whether they were obliged to obey, for Spanish\r\njealousy of the curia was quite as acute as indignation caused by\r\ninvasion of inquisitorial inviolability and appeals to Rome were\r\nabsolutely forbidden to all parties.[222] It was impossible to devise\r\nany permanent basis of pacification between the conflicting\r\njurisdictions and, up to 1630, there were enumerated no less than seven\r\nConcordias, or agreements to settle their respective pretensions, in\r\nspite of which the disturbances continued as actively as ever.[223]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring the War of the Spanish Succession, Sardinia was captured by the\r\nAllies in 1708 and, in 1718, it passed into possession of the House of\r\nSavoy. As soon as the Spanish domination ceased the Inquisition\r\ndisappeared and the bishops revendicated their jurisdiction over heresy,\r\neach one organizing an Inquisition of his own, not so much, we are told,\r\nwith the object of eradicating heresy as to enable them to exempt\r\nretainers from public burdens, by appointing them to useless\r\noffices.[224] Jealousy of the Inquisition had been the traditional\r\npolicy of the Dukes of Savoy[225] and, as the support of the secular arm\r\nwas essential to the activity of the institution, we may presume that\r\neven these episcopal substitutes faded away in silence. In 1775 a survey\r\nof the ecclesiastical and religious condition of the island makes no\r\nallusion to prosecutions for heresy although it records a tradition\r\nthat, towards the end of the seventeenth century, certain Quietists and\r\nfollowers of Molinos had found refuge in the mountain caves.[226]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nMILAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the treaty of Cambrai, in 1529, Francis I abandoned the Milanese to\r\nCharles V and it thenceforth formed part of the Italian possessions of\r\nSpain. In the eleventh and twelfth centuries it had been the hot-bed of\r\nheresy and it was, in the thirteenth, one of the earliest scenes of\r\ninquisitorial activity. It was there that Pietro di Verona sealed his\r\ndevotion with his blood and became the patron saint of the Holy Office.\r\nWith the gradual extermination of heresy, the Inquisition there as\r\nelsewhere grew inert and, even after the new and threatening development\r\nof the Reformation, when Paul III, in 1536, was alarmed by reports of\r\nthe proselyting zeal and success of Fra Battista da Crema, he had no\r\ntribunal on which he could rely to suppress the heretic. In default of\r\nthis he commissioned Giovanni, Bishop of Modena, who was then in Milan,\r\ntogether with the Dominican Provincial, to preach against the heretics\r\nand to punish according to law those whom they might find guilty, at the\r\nsame time significantly forbidding the inquisitor and the episcopal\r\nOrdinary to interfere.[227]\r\n\r\nEven when the Inquisition was reorganized by Paul III, in 1542, it was\r\nfor some time inefficiently administered and lacked the secular support\r\nrequisite to its usefulness. This was especially felt in the Milanese\r\nwhich, from its neighborhood to Switzerland and the Waldensian Valleys,\r\nwas peculiarly exposed to infection. The adventure which brought the\r\nDominican Fra Michele Ghislieri into notice and opened for him the path\r\nto the papacy, shows the danger and difficulty of the situation. Heresy\r\nwas creeping through the Grisons, the Valtelline and the Val di\r\nChiavenna, forming part of the diocese of Como when, in 1550, Fra\r\nMichele was sent thither as inquisitor to arrest its progress. He found\r\na dozen bales of heretic books consigned to a merchant in Como, to be\r\ndistributed throughout Italy where, in all the cities, there were said\r\nto be agencies for the purpose. He seized the books in the custom-house,\r\nwhereupon the merchant complained to the episcopal vicar, who took\r\npossession of them. Ghislieri wrote to the Roman Holy Office which cited\r\nthe vicar and the canons to appear; in place of obeying, they appealed\r\nto Ferrando Gonzaga, Governor of Milan, and raised such a storm among\r\nthe people that Ghislieri’s life was in danger. Gonzaga summoned him to\r\ncome to him the next day; he started at night on foot and it was only\r\nthe accident of his taking the longer road that led him to escape an\r\nambush where he would have shared the fate of St. Peter Martyr. Gonzaga\r\nthreatened him with imprisonment, but finally allowed him to depart,\r\nwhen he went to Rome and so impressed the cardinals of the Holy Office\r\nthat he was marked for promotion. It was not much better in 1561 when,\r\nafter being created Bishop of Mondovi, he visited his diocese and\r\nreturned dissatisfied, for he had been unable to secure the support of\r\nthe secular arm for the suppression of heresy.[228]\r\n\r\nIn Milan, we are told, there were many heretics, not only among the\r\nlaity but among the clergy, both regular and secular, some of whom seem\r\nto have been publicly known and to have enjoyed the protection of the\r\nauthorities. In 1554 Archbishop Arcimboldo and Inquisitor Castiglione\r\nunited in issuing an Edict of Faith, comprehensive in its character,\r\npromising for spontaneous confession and denunciation of accomplices the\r\nreward of a fourth part of the fines and confiscations that might ensue.\r\nDenunciation of heretics was also commanded, with assurance of secrecy\r\nfor the informer. This Edict is moreover of especial interest as\r\ncomprehending what is perhaps the earliest organization of censorship,\r\nfor it required the denunciation of all prohibited books and the\r\npresentation by booksellers of inventories of their stocks, with heavy\r\npenalties for omissions or for dealing in the prohibited wares.[229]\r\nThis zeal seems not to have aroused the secular authorities to a fitting\r\nsense of their duties, for a brief of Paul IV, May 20, 1556, to Cardinal\r\nMandrusio, lieutenant of Philip II, recites how that son of iniquity,\r\nthe apostate Augustinian Claudio de Pralboino, had been condemned by the\r\ninquisitor and handed over to the secular arm; how, while awaiting his\r\nfate in the public prison, a forged order, purporting to be signed by\r\nthe inquisitor, had been fabricated by some lawyers, on the strength of\r\nwhich he escaped and, in view of all this, the cardinal is urged to see\r\nto the punishment of those concerned in the fraud, to lend all aid and\r\nassistance to the inquisitor and to be watchful against the heresies\r\ncreeping in from the Grisons. It was doubtless with the hope of securing\r\ngreater efficiency that, in 1558, the Inquisition was taken from the\r\nfriars of San Eustorgio and confided to those of Santa Maria delle\r\nGrazie and the Dominican Gianbattista da Cremona was appointed\r\ninquisitor-general.[230]\r\n\r\nIn 1560, Cardinal Carlo Borromeo, in his twenty-second year, was,\r\nthrough the nepotism of his uncle Pius IV, appointed to the great\r\narchiepiscopate of Milan, which extended over all Lombardy. Sincere as\r\nwas his piety, he accepted an office which he did not fill, for he\r\nremained in Rome until the severe virtue of Pius V, in 1566, required\r\nhim to reside in his see. His ceaseless labors to reform his people,\r\nboth clergy and laity, his self-devotion, his charity, earned for him\r\nthe honors of canonization and the admiration even of Jansenists, but\r\nthe zeal displayed in the enforcement of discipline upon unwilling\r\necclesiastics found equal expression in the persecution of heretics. He\r\nwas, in fact, the incarnation of the Counter-Reformation, in combating\r\nheresy by force as well as by depriving it, as far as possible, of its\r\n_raison d’être_. In the early years of his archiepiscopate, during his\r\nattendance on the papal court, the business of the Inquisition in Milan\r\nwas carried on in most slovenly fashion. This was not for lack of any\r\nsensitiveness as to heresy for, when in July, 1561, the Franciscan\r\nGuardian of Marignano, being delayed in making a sacramental confession,\r\nexclaimed, in a fit of impatience, that confession to God sufficed, he\r\nwas arrested for such heretical speech and sent for trial to Milan,\r\nunder a guard of soldiers. They arrived at night and carried their\r\nprisoner to the archiepiscopal palace, where they were told to take him\r\nto the prison, but misunderstanding, as was said, their instructions,\r\nthey marched him to one of the city gates and let him go, whereupon he\r\nnaturally disappeared.[231] In that same month of July, Carlo’s uncle,\r\nGiulio Cesare Borromeo, writes to him that the inquisitor has allowed to\r\nescape a certain chief of the Lutherans, whom he had had infinite\r\ntrouble to seize; he would give a thousand ducats that the culprit had\r\nnot been brought to Milan for, as a relapsed, he was already convicted.\r\nHe shrewdly suspects complicity, but there is no remedy and great\r\nscandal is to be expected.[232] Matters probably did not improve when,\r\nin the Spring of 1563, the inquisitor Fra Angelo da Cremona involved\r\nhimself in a bitter quarrel with Andrea Ruberto, the archbishop’s vicar,\r\nover a printer named Moscheno, whom he had cast into prison and whose\r\nwife and work-people he threatened to arrest. It was a conflict of\r\njurisdiction, the vicar claiming concurrent action and the inquisitor\r\nthat his cognizance of the case was exclusive. The vicar appealed to the\r\narchbishop and represented the inquisitor in no flattering terms. The\r\ninquisitor wrote to the Roman Congregation that the vicar was a man\r\nwithout fear of God and was interfering to protect a heretic who was\r\ndisseminating his heresies throughout the land; he had refused the\r\nvicar’s request to communicate the proceedings, as he desired to\r\npreserve the privileges of the Holy Office. Carlo counselled moderation\r\nto his vicar and, as the latter was replaced the next year by Nicolò\r\nOrmanetto, he was evidently worsted in the encounter.[233]\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that this imperfect working of the machinery of\r\npersecution should prove wholly unsatisfactory to Philip II. Twenty\r\nyears had elapsed since the reconstruction of the papal Inquisition, yet\r\nin the Lombard province where, if anywhere, it should be active and\r\nunsparing and where he had ordered his representatives to give it all\r\nfavor and assistance, it was proving manifestly unequal to its duties.\r\nThe natural remedy lay in taking it out of hands that proved incompetent\r\nand in remodelling it after the Spanish fashion and this he resolved to\r\ndo. He applied to Pius IV for the necessary briefs, but met with some\r\ndelay. This was inevitable. The Roman Congregation had already ample\r\nexperience of the unyielding independence of the Spanish Suprema and it\r\ncould only look with disfavor on having to surrender to its rival so\r\nimportant a portion of its own territory, with the inevitable result of\r\nan endless series of broils in which it would probably often be worsted.\r\nAt that time however Philip’s request was equivalent to a command; it\r\nwas difficult to frame a plausible reason for refusal and Pius gave his\r\nassent.[234] It was Philip’s intention that the Milanese Inquisition\r\nshould be organized on an imposing scale and he had a commission as\r\ninquisitor issued to Gaspar Cervantes, an experienced Spanish\r\ninquisitor, then Archbishop of Messina and recently elected to the see\r\nof Salerno, but Pius delayed the confirmation for months. Cervantes was\r\nat the council of Trent when he received the commission; he replied\r\nthat, as the decree requiring episcopal residence had been adopted, he\r\ncould not be absent from his see more than three months at a time, but\r\nthat, if the king considered his services at Milan essential, he would\r\nresign the archbishopric. Archbishop Calini, who reports this from\r\nTrent, August 23, 1563, adds that two ambassadors from Milan had just\r\narrived there to plead with the papal legates against the introduction\r\nof the Spanish Inquisition in their city.[235]\r\n\r\nIn fact, as soon as the rumor spread of the impending change, there\r\narose an agitation which speedily grew to serious proportions and\r\nthreatened a repetition of the experiences of Naples. The people\r\ndeclared that they would not submit peaceably. The municipal Council of\r\nSixty at once arranged to send envoys to Philip, to the pope, and to the\r\nlegates at Trent. The latter reached there, as we have seen, on August\r\n22d and their instructions doubtless were the same as those prepared for\r\nthe envoys to the pope, representing that the existing Inquisition was\r\nthoroughly manned and active and had the earnest support of the secular\r\nauthorities, while the mere prospect of introducing the Spanish\r\ninstitution had so alarmed the people that many were already leaving the\r\ncity, threatening its depopulation if the project were persisted in and\r\nthe transfer of its commerce and industries to rival communities. The\r\nenvoys to the pope were also told to invoke the good offices of Cardinal\r\nBorromeo and to point out that, as he was responsible for the\r\nInquisition and for the defence of the faith in Milan, the necessity for\r\na new organization would infer neglect of duty on the part of his\r\nrepresentatives.[236]\r\n\r\nA Milanese agent of the Cardinal-Archbishop confirmed this in a letter\r\nto him of August 25th, describing the great popular perturbation,\r\narising not from a consciousness of the existence of heresy but from\r\nthe disgrace of the imputation and the dread of the facilities offered\r\nfor the gratification of malignity, coupled with the destruction of the\r\nfamilies of the accused. It were to be wished that the virtue of the\r\npeople was equal to their devotion, for the ardor of their faith was\r\nseen in the frequentation of the sacraments, the great demand for\r\nindulgences and the performance of other pious works.[237] Further news\r\nwas sent to him, September 1st, by his confidential agent, Tullio\r\nAlbonesi, who reported that the governor, the Duke of Sessa, has not\r\nwished the city to send envoys to Philip II, for he had already taken\r\nmeasures to prevent the introduction of the dreaded tribunal. Still it\r\nwas desirable that the cardinal, on his part, should see that this\r\nturned out to be successful, for the popular mind was so inflamed that\r\ngreat disorder would be inevitable and it would be well for him to let\r\nit be clearly seen that he had opposed the project so as to disabuse\r\nthose who asserted the contrary.[238] The municipal authorities trusted\r\nthe governor and promptly abandoned their purpose of sending envoys to\r\nthe king and to the pope. These had already been chosen and had arranged\r\nfor the journey, incurring expenses which had to be defrayed.\r\nAccordingly, at a meeting of the Council of Sixty, held September 24th,\r\nit was resolved that, as the governor had stopped them and taken upon\r\nhimself to deal with the king and the pope, the envoys should be repaid\r\nthe fifteen hundred ducats expended in preparations, on their\r\nsurrendering the articles purchased for the purpose, which were then to\r\nbe publicly sold at sound of trumpet in the Plaza delli Mercanti, as was\r\ncustomary in such cases. Besides this there had already been spent a\r\nhundred and ten ducats in twice sending letters to the pope and\r\ncardinals.[239]\r\n\r\nThe mission to Trent had proved conspicuously serviceable, for the\r\npopular resistance was efficiently seconded by the bishops assembled\r\nthere. Those of Lombardy dreaded to be exposed to the experience\r\nendured by their Spanish brethren, humiliated in their dioceses by the\r\nunrestrained autocracy of the inquisitors. Those of Naples argued that,\r\nif the Spanish Inquisition were once installed in Milan, it would surely\r\nbe extended to Naples, with similar results to them. Those of the rest\r\nof Italy felt that it could not then be refused to the princes of the\r\nother states, while the papal legates recognized that in such case the\r\nauthority of the Holy See would be seriously crippled, for the\r\nallegiance of the bishops would be transferred to their secular rulers\r\nwho could control them through the inquisitors and, in the event of\r\nanother general council, it would be the princes and not the pope that\r\nwould predominate in its deliberations. Earnest representations to this\r\neffect were promptly sent to Rome and great was the relief in Trent when\r\nword came that the pope was of the same opinion and would not assent to\r\nthe execution of the project.[240]\r\n\r\nEven Philip’s fixity of purpose gave way before these obstacles, but he\r\ndelayed long before yielding. More than two months of anxiety followed,\r\nuntil at length, on November 8th, he wrote to the Duke of Sessa that his\r\nreport as to the condition of Milan had been confirmed by letters\r\nfurnished by the Bishop of Cuenca. His dextrous management in preventing\r\nthe envoys from coming was praised and, in conformity with his\r\njudgement, the Bishop-elect of Salerno was ordered not to leave Trent\r\nand the efforts to obtain faculties for him from the pope were to be\r\nabandoned. The duke was ordered to tell the people, as plausibly as he\r\ncould, that Philip had never had the intention of introducing any\r\ninnovation in the procedure of the Inquisition but only to appoint an\r\ninquisitor of more authority and with larger revenue, who could do what\r\nwas necessary for the service of God in that infected time and dangerous\r\nneighborhood. They could rely that there would be no change and the king\r\nwas confident that so Catholic and zealous a community would do its duty\r\nas heretofore.[241] The whole letter shows how unwillingly he withdrew\r\nfrom a position that had become untenable and how hard he strove to\r\nobtain a capitulation with the honors of war.\r\n\r\nPhilip’s failure left the Milanese Inquisition in its unsatisfactory\r\ncondition. There was one burning question especially which refused to be\r\nsettled. Political considerations of the greatest moment required the\r\nmaintenance of friendly relations with the Catholic Cantons of\r\nSwitzerland, but the Catholic Cantons were deeply infected with heresy.\r\nMoreover the financial interests of the Milanese called for free\r\ncommercial intercourse with their northern neighbors while, at the same\r\ntime, the rules of the Inquisition forbade the residence of heretics\r\nand dealings with them. It was impossible to reconcile the\r\nirreconcileable--to erect a Chinese wall between Lombardy and\r\nSwitzerland, as the Roman Holy Office desired, and at the same time to\r\nretain the friendship of the Swiss and maintain contentment among the\r\nLombards. Intolerance had to yield to politics and commerce, but not\r\nwithout perpetual protest. Tullio Albonesi writes, April 12, 1564, to\r\nCardinal Borromeo that he had presented to the Duke of Sessa the letter\r\nasking him to cease employing those heretic Grisons, the Capitano\r\nHercole Salice and his sons and had remonstrated with him in accordance\r\nwith the information received from the inquisitor. The duke was to\r\ndepart for Spain the next day, but took time to explain that the pope\r\nwas misinformed as to his wishing to bring heretics to reside in the\r\nMilanese; he had arranged to pay them in their own country for the\r\nking’s service and had given them greater privileges of trade than were\r\naccorded to the Grisons in general under the capitulations and, if this\r\ndid not please his Holiness, he must treat with the king about it.\r\nAlbonesi adds that he reported this to the inquisitor who concluded that\r\nthe only way to stop the trade of these heretics with the Milanese was\r\nfor the pope to appeal to Philip.[242] The next year we find the Bishop\r\nof Brescia, in a letter to Borromeo, alluding to two persons in his\r\ndiocese suspected of heresy because they caused scandal by dealing with\r\nthe Grisons.[243]\r\n\r\nHow delicate were these international relations and how little the\r\nInquisition was disposed to respect them are manifest in an occurrence\r\nsome years later, after Cardinal Borromeo had come to reside in his see.\r\nIn visiting some Swiss districts of his province he promulgated some\r\nregulations displeasing to the people, who sent an ambassador to\r\ncomplain to the Governor of Milan. He took lodgings with a merchant and,\r\nas soon as the inquisitor heard of his arrival, he arrested and threw\r\nhim in prison. This arrogant violation of the law of nations was a\r\npeculiarly dangerous blunder and, as soon as news of it reached the\r\ngovernor he released the envoy from prison and made him a fitting\r\napology, but word had already been carried to the Swiss, who made prompt\r\narrangements to seize the cardinal. Borromeo escaped by a few hours, and\r\nhis obnoxious regulations were never obeyed.[244] How completely, in his\r\neyes, all material interests were to be disregarded, in comparison with\r\nthe danger of infection from heresy, is to be seen in a pastoral letter\r\naddressed, in 1580, to all parish priests--a letter which is moreover\r\ninstructive as to the extent to which the ecclesiastical jurisdiction\r\ntrespassed on the secular. He recites the danger to the faith arising\r\nfrom those who, under pretext of business or other pretence, visit\r\nheretical lands, where they may be perverted, and on their return spread\r\nthe infection, wherefore he orders that no one shall make such journeys\r\nor visits without first obtaining a licence from him or from his\r\nvicar-general or from the inquisitor. All who disobey this are to be\r\nprosecuted by the Inquisition as suspect of heresy and are to be\r\npenanced at discretion. This letter is to be read from the altar on\r\nthree feast-days and subsequently several times a year, while the\r\npriests are further ordered to investigate and report within a month all\r\nwho are absent, the cause of their going and the length of their\r\nstay.[245] The question was one which refused to be settled and was the\r\nsubject of repeated decrees by the Roman Congregation, which serve to\r\nexplain why the nations subjected to the Inquisition fell behind their\r\nmore liberal rivals in the race for prosperity.[246]\r\n\r\nWith the failure to introduce the Spanish Inquisition, Cardinal Borromeo\r\nseems to have felt increased responsibility for the suppression of\r\nheresy, prompting him to efforts to render the Milanese tribunal more\r\nefficient. In his correspondence of 1564 and 1565, we find him paying\r\nthe salary of the inquisitor, enlarging the archiepiscopal prison with\r\nthe proceeds of confiscations and discussing the transfer of the\r\nInquisition from the monastery of le Grazie to the archiepiscopal\r\npalace, where it would be more conveniently and honorably established.\r\nHe is also recognized as its head, for Fra Felice da Colorno, the\r\ninquisitor of Como, asks his instructions about a box of books addressed\r\nto the impious Vergerio, which he has found among those hidden by the\r\nRev. Don Hippolito Chizzuola.[247] In fact, the Inquisition of the\r\nperiod seems to be a curious combination of the inquisitorial and\r\nepiscopal jurisdictions. As early as 1549 we find the Roman Congregation\r\ngiving to Antonio Bishop of Trieste a commission as its commissioner as\r\nthough the ordinary jurisdiction were insufficient.[248] In 1564 Gasparo\r\nBishop of Asti boasts to Cardinal Borromeo of his earnest labors in\r\nkeeping his diocese free of heresy, although the neighboring ones were\r\ninfected; in 1565 Costaciario Bishop of Acqui excuses himself for delay\r\nin obeying the summons to the first provincial council (October 15th)\r\nbecause he was engaged on an important trial of a heretic whom he had\r\nimprisoned; in November of the same year Bollani Bishop of Brescia\r\nwrites in considerable dread of the Signory of Venice because he had\r\nforced the podestà to abjure for some impudent and reckless speeches; he\r\nthrows the responsibility on the cardinal and begs that his letter may\r\nbe burnt. A few days later he seems much relieved, for the podestà has\r\napologized and he describes a curious assembly “la solita nostra\r\ncongrega della Santa Inquisizione,” which he was accustomed to hold\r\nweekly in his palace, consisting of the inquisitor, the podestà, the\r\nrettori (or Venetian governors) and some others, when the inquisitor\r\nrejoiced them by reporting that there were but two heretics in the city,\r\none of whom was _mentecaptus_.[249]\r\n\r\nEvidently Cardinal Borromeo was stimulating his suffragans to increased\r\nzeal and activity and when, in 1566, he came to reside in Milan, his\r\nardor for the extermination of heresy grew apace, whether through his\r\nown convictions or through the impetuous urgency of the new\r\nInquisitor-Pope, St. Pius V, whose aim was to subject the whole\r\nChristian world to the Holy Office.[250] There is a curious memorandum\r\ndrawn up by Borromeo, detailing the matters to be enquired into in\r\nepiscopal visitations, which shows that the persecution of heresy, the\r\nefficiency of the Inquisition, the avoidance of communication with\r\nheretics and the observances of the faith were regarded by him as the\r\npoints of first importance.[251] In 1568 he was suddenly summoned to\r\nMantua as the most fitting person to put the Inquisition there into\r\nworking order. The duke, Guillelmo Gonzaga, was liberally inclined and\r\nhad long given trouble to the Holy Office. Pius V, soon after his\r\naccession, in 1566, had been moved to pious wrath by his refusal to send\r\nto Rome two heretics for trial. A threat to bring him to terms by open\r\nwar failed and Pius would have proceeded to extremities, had he not been\r\ndissuaded by the other Italian princes.[252] He contented himself with\r\nsending orders to the inquisitor there, Fra Ambrogio Aldegato, to clear\r\nthe city of heretics, who were numerous, but the frate was old; he\r\nshrank from the struggle and, pleading age and infirmity, he asked to be\r\nrelieved. Pius gave him the bishopric of Casale and extended over Mantua\r\nthe jurisdiction of Fra Camillo Campeggio, styled Inquisitor-general of\r\nFerrara, who had doubtless been selected as a man of vigor for that\r\npost, in view of the encouragement to the reform given not long before\r\nby Renée de France, the Duchess of Ferrara. The new inquisitor was not\r\nfavorably regarded by Gonzaga, who interfered with the public penances\r\nand abjurations imposed by him, who was slack in obeying his commands to\r\nmake arrests and who even allowed suspected heretics to escape.\r\nCampeggio was more earnest than respectful in his remonstrances and\r\nmutual ill-will increased until, on Christmas night of 1567, some sons\r\nof Belial slew two Dominicans who had doubtless been overzealous in\r\naiding the inquisitor. No active efforts were made to detect the\r\nassassins; some higher authority was evidently needed and Pius V, by a\r\nbrief of February 12, 1568, ordered Cardinal Borromeo to go there with\r\nall speed, to bring the duke to obedience and to sit with the inquisitor\r\nin the trial of cases. Borromeo lost no time in obeying the mandate and,\r\non his arrival he gave the duke to understand that the pope’s\r\ndetermination was unalterable; he would rather see all Dominicans cut to\r\npieces, and all Dominican convents burnt, than that heresy should go\r\nunpunished in Mantua. It required resolute action for there were\r\nheretics high-placed in both Church and State; a company of sbirri had\r\nto be borrowed from Bologna, but Borromeo succeeded in breaking down all\r\nopposition. Already, by May 16th, he was able to report that his mission\r\nwas accomplished and that his presence was no longer needed. On May 21st\r\nhe writes that the duke has come humbly to the inquisitor to beg for\r\nrelease from prison and sanbenito of two penitents, which was granted,\r\nseeing that they had already been compelled to abjure publicly. As the\r\npope had rewarded Campeggio with the bishopric of Sutri and Nepi, the\r\nduke had at once begged that the place might be filled by Fra Angelo,\r\nthe vicar of the Inquisition, to all of which the cardinal points\r\ntriumphantly as showing how the ducal temper had changed. Possibly some\r\nexplanation of this may be sought in a request from the duke that the\r\nconfiscations should be made over to him, which Borromeo was willing to\r\nmeet in so far as to suggest that he be allowed one half. Another reason\r\nmay perhaps be discerned in his apprehension of an attack by the Duke of\r\nSavoy, for, on June 4th, Borromeo writes that he had asked for the\r\nsupport of the papacy in such contingency. Be this as it may, Borromeo\r\nwas able in June to return to Milan, leaving the Inquisition firmly\r\nestablished in Mantua.[253]\r\n\r\nIt is an indication of his predominating zeal for the extirpation of\r\nheresy that when, on May 16th, he begged permission to return to Milan,\r\nthe reason he assigned was that he was wanted there for the\r\nlong-protracted trial of Nicholas Cid. This was a case which had for\r\nyears been occupying the Milanese Inquisition. The accused was\r\ntreasurer-general of the Spanish forces, in whose favor Cesare Gonzaga\r\nwrote, November 2, 1565, to the cardinal, repeating what he had\r\nfrequently stated before, that it was a persecution arising from\r\nmalignity.[254] This ardor for the purity of the faith did not diminish\r\nwith time. In his second provincial council, held in 1569, the first\r\ndecree requires the bishops to promulgate an edict to be read in all the\r\nparish churches, on the first Sundays in Lent and Advent, calling upon\r\nall persons, under pain of excommunication, to denounce within ten days,\r\nto the bishop or inquisitor, any case of heresy or of reading forbidden\r\nbooks that may come to their knowledge. His own formula for this, in\r\n1572, is very stringent, insisting on the denunciation of every heretic\r\nact or suspicious word.[255]\r\n\r\nIt is evident that thus far the episcopal jurisdiction over heresy was\r\nnot superseded by the inquisitorial, but that both worked in harmony\r\nand, between the two, it may be questioned whether the Milanese gained\r\nmuch in escaping the Spanish Inquisition. As the Roman organization\r\nperfected itself throughout Northern Italy, Milan naturally was a centre\r\nof activity, as a sort of bulwark against the influence of Switzerland.\r\nThe troubles arising from the inevitable commercial intercourse with the\r\nheretics, and the capitulations which provided for the residence of\r\ntraders on each side, continued to be a source of perpetual anxiety and\r\nvigilance. Then the transit of merchandise had to be watched; everything\r\ndestined for Milan had to be opened and searched for heretic literature,\r\nbut packages in transmission were allowed to pass through, relying upon\r\nexamination at the points of destination. Correspondence by mail was\r\nalso the subject of much solicitude. In 1588 the Congregation of the\r\nInquisition was excited by the news that the heretic Cantons proposed to\r\nestablish in the Valtelline a school for instruction in their doctrines,\r\nwhereupon it wrote urgent letters and threatened to cut off all\r\nintercourse if the project was not abandoned. In the same year it wrote\r\nto the Milanese inquisitor favoring warmly the plan of rewarding those\r\nwho would capture and deliver to the tribunal heretic preachers and\r\npromising to pay for “this holy and pious work” according to the\r\nimportance of the victims kidnapped, but it uttered a warning that this\r\nhad better not be attempted in the Grisons, for fear of reprisals that\r\nwould ruin the Catholic churches and monasteries there. In 1593 the\r\ntribunal was reminded that, while the capitulations permitted the\r\nresidence of heretic merchants from the Grisons and Switzerland, the\r\nprivilege was confined to them and all others must be prosecuted and\r\npunished. As for Milanese who desire to go to Switzerland, returning\r\nhome several times a year, they are to be watched, and licences are not\r\nto be given to reside in places where they cannot have access to\r\nCatholic priests. Then, in 1597, there was fresh excitement over an\r\nedict of the Three Leagues, prohibiting the residence in the Valtelline\r\nof foreign priests and friars. In 1599 the zeal of the Milanese tribunal\r\nseems to have provoked reclamations on the part of the Swiss, for the\r\ninquisitor was ordered not to molest the heretic merchants but to\r\nobserve the capitulations strictly. This was doubtless part of an\r\noutburst of persecution for, in 1600, orders were given to seize and\r\nretain the children of the heretics who had fled to Switzerland.[256]\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the Milanese tribunal had ample work in protecting\r\nthe faith from hostile invasion. Its activity continued under the\r\nSpanish Hapsburgs until, in 1707, the genius of Prince Eugene won\r\nLombardy for Austria, as an incident in the War of the Spanish\r\nSuccession. It still existed on sufferance until the eighteenth century\r\nwas well advanced. In 1771 Maria Theresa foreshadowed the end by\r\nordering that no future vacancies should be filled and by suppressing\r\nthe affiliated Order of the Crocesignati, whose property was assigned to\r\nthe support of orphanages. This was followed by a decree of March 9,\r\n1775, declaring that the existence of such an independent jurisdiction\r\nwas incompatible with the supremacy and good order of the State,\r\nwherefore it was abolished and, as the inquisitors and their vicars\r\nshould die, their salaries should be applied to the orphanages.[257]\r\nThus passed away the oldest surviving Inquisition, which may be said to\r\ndate from 1232, when we find Fra Alberico commissioned as Inquisitor of\r\nLombardy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE CANARIES.[258]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1402 Jean de Bethencourt, an adventurer from Normandy, discovered or\r\nrediscovered the Canaries and made himself master of the islands of\r\nLanzarote, Fuerteventura, Gomera and Hierro. After various changes of\r\nownership, they fell to the crown of Castile, and Isabella undertook the\r\nconquest of the remainder of the group, the Grand Canary, Tenerife and\r\nla Palma. The sturdy resistance of the native Guanches rendered the\r\nenterprise an arduous one, consuming eighteen years, and it was not\r\nuntil 1496 that it was finally accomplished. That Columbus, on his first\r\nvoyage, took his departure from Gomera indicates the importance assumed\r\nby the Canaries in the development of trade with the New World and this,\r\nconjoined with their productiveness, as they became settled and\r\ncultivated, rendered them a centre of commerce frequented by the ships\r\nof all maritime nations, as well as an object of buccaneering raids, in\r\nan age when trade and piracy were sometimes indistinguishable. Their\r\nproximity to Morocco and the Guinea coast moreover exposed them to\r\nattacks from the Moors and gave them an opportunity of accumulating\r\nMoorish and negro slaves, whom the piety of the age sought to convert\r\ninto Christians by the water of baptism. In various ways, therefore,\r\nthere came to be abundant material for inquisitorial activity, although\r\nthe Judaizing New Christians, who furnished the Spanish tribunals with\r\ntheir principal business, appear to have been singularly few.\r\n\r\nThere was no haste in extending the Spanish Inquisition to the Canaries.\r\nAs early as 1406 a bishopric had been founded in Lanzarote, subsequently\r\ntransferred to Las Palmas in the Grand Canary, which was regarded as the\r\ncapital of the group. If the successive bishops, who, with more or less\r\nregularity, filled the see, exercised their episcopal jurisdiction over\r\nheresy, their labors have left no trace. It is not until the time of\r\nDiego de Muros, who was consecrated in 1496, that we have any evidence\r\nof such action. That stirring prelate, who held a diocesan synod in\r\n1497, announced, April 25, 1499, that, as inquisitor by his ordinary\r\nauthority, he would have inquest made in some of the islands into heresy\r\nand Judaism and other crimes against the faith. What was the result, we\r\nhave no means of knowing except a confession made, on May 22d, by Isabel\r\nRamírez, of having taught a superstitious prayer which was regarded as\r\nsorcery. It is probable that Bishop Muros was warned that he was\r\ninvading the jurisdiction of the Holy Office, for he sent the papers in\r\nthe case to the tribunal of Seville.[259] It is noteworthy that, after\r\nthe establishment of the Canary tribunal, the bishops and their\r\nprovisors long continued to use the title of “ordinary” inquisitor, to\r\nwhich no exception seems to have been taken, although elsewhere it was\r\ncontested and forbidden. The latest occasion of its employment with\r\nwhich I have met occurs in 1672.[260]\r\n\r\nIt was not until 1505 that the Suprema bethought itself of establishing\r\na tribunal in the Canaries, when Inquisitor-general Deza appointed as\r\ninquisitor Bartolomé López Tribaldos. The first entry in his register is\r\ndated Tuesday, October 28, 1505, and the earliest record that we have of\r\nhis activity is in 1507, when there were two reconciliations, one of\r\nJuan de Ler, a Portuguese, for Judaism, and the other of Ana Rodríguez,\r\na native, for sorceries, whose sanbenitos were duly hung in the\r\ncathedral.[261] What were the exact powers conferred on Tribaldos we\r\nhave no means of knowing, but they must have been exceedingly limited,\r\nand for a long time the tribunal continued to be in close dependence on\r\nthat of Seville. When, about 1520, Martin Ximenes, fiscal of the Seville\r\ntribunal, came to Las Palmas in the combined capacity of precentor of\r\nthe Cathedral, provisor and inquisitor, he left as his deputy fiscal in\r\nSeville Doctor Fernando de Zamora, thus not abandoning that office. Even\r\nas late as 1548 we chance to have the record of a _consulta de fe_ held\r\nby the Seville tribunal, January 13th, to decide on certain informations\r\nand cases sent to it by the Canary inquisitor Padilla. In the affair of\r\nJuan Alonso, a Morisco, it was ordered that he should be arrested and\r\ntried, when the result was to be reported for action. In that of Juan\r\nFernández, he was to be summoned and examined as to his blasphemy and\r\nthen be penanced at the discretion of Padilla and the Ordinary. Leonor\r\nde Lera was to be arrested and tried and the result be submitted. The\r\ncase of Diego Martínez had apparently been concluded under Padilla, for\r\nthe Seville consulta sentenced him to twelve years of galley\r\nservice.[262] Thus every act, from the preliminary arrest to the final\r\ndecision, was regulated from Seville. To render the position still more\r\nanomalous we hear of an _inquisidor ordinario_, Alonso Vivas, Prior of\r\nthe cathedral, commissioned, in October, 1523, to try cases of faith\r\nthroughout the Grand Canary as he had already done in Telde and\r\nAgüimes.[263]\r\n\r\nIrregular and imperfect as may have been the organization of the\r\ntribunal, it yet managed to accomplish some convictions. In 1510 there\r\nwas held an auto de fe in which there were three reconciliations for\r\nJudaism and one, of a Moorish slave, for reincidence in Mahometan error,\r\nwhile a fifth culprit was penanced for Judaism.[264] Then in 1513\r\noccurred the first relaxation, that of Alonso Fátima, a native Morisco,\r\nwho had fled to Barbary. This was always deemed sufficient evidence of\r\nrelapse to former errors, and he was duly burned in effigy. It was\r\nprobably also to 1516 that may be attributed the first relaxation in\r\nperson--that of Juan de Xeres of Seville, for Judaism. It shows that the\r\ntribunal was indifferently equipped that, when he was sentenced to\r\ntorture, the physician whose presence was obligatory on such occasions,\r\nDoctor Juan Meneses de Gallegas, was required personally to administer\r\nit. It was exceedingly severe, extending to eleven jars of water; the\r\naccused was unable to endure it; he confessed his faith, was sentenced\r\nto relaxation as a relapsed and for fictitious confession, and was\r\nexecuted on Wednesday, June 4th.[265]\r\n\r\nMartin Ximenes seems to have performed his duties with commendable\r\nenergy. He commenced by making an alphabetical register of all the\r\nparties denounced under his predecessor, comprising 139 individuals,\r\nbesides various groups, such as “the Confesos and Moriscos of\r\nLanzarote,” “other Confesos, their kindred,” “certain persons of Hierro”\r\netc., which indicate how slovenly had been the procedure.[266] He made a\r\nvisitation of Tenerife and la Palma, from which he returned with ample\r\nstore of fresh denunciations.[267] May 29, 1524, all the dignitaries,\r\ncivil and ecclesiastical, and all the people were assembled in the\r\nchurch of Santa Ana, where an edict was read commanding them to render\r\naid and favor to the Inquisition, and an oath to that effect was\r\nadministered. There was also an Edict of Grace, promising relief from\r\nconfiscation to all who would come forward and confess as to themselves\r\nand others; also an Edict of Faith requiring denunciation of errors and\r\nspecifying the various kinds of blasphemies and sorceries and the\r\ndistinctive Jewish and Moorish rites; and finally an edict reciting that\r\nthe Conversos were emigrating and forbidding their leaving the islands\r\nand all ship-masters from carrying away suspected persons without\r\nlicence from him, under the penalties of fautorship and of forfeiting\r\ntheir vessels.[268]\r\n\r\nThe terror inspired by the activity of Ximenes may be estimated from a\r\nsingle instance. On May 21st, Ynes de Tarifa came before him to confess\r\nthat when, a couple of months before, she had heard of the burning in\r\nSeville of her son-in-law Alonso Hernández and of his brother Francisco,\r\nshe recalled that after meals Alonso used to read to Francisco out of a\r\nbook in an unknown tongue and, if she had erred in not denouncing this\r\nto the Seville tribunal, she begged to be treated mercifully.[269] The\r\npublication of the edicts throughout the islands brought in an abundant\r\nstore of denunciations, the record for eight months, from September 13,\r\n1524, to May 15, 1526, amounting to 167. They were nearly all of petty\r\nsorceries by women, in sickness or love affairs, but with an occasional\r\nblasphemy or suspicion of Judaism, and persons of station were not\r\nexempted, for the list comprises the Adelantado Don Pedro de Lugo and\r\nhis wife Elvira Diaz, the Dean Juan de Alarcon, the Prior Alonso Bivas\r\nand others of position. The adelantado, in fact, was dead, but the\r\naccusation against his memory is sufficiently significant of the\r\nprevailing temper to be worth relating. The Bachiller Diego de Funes\r\ncame forward, by command of his confessor, to state that when Diego de\r\nSan Martin was holding for ransom a _Judío de señal_ (one obliged to\r\nwear a distinctive mark) who had been caught on his way to Portugal, the\r\ncaptive was starving to death because he could not eat meat slaughtered\r\nby Christians: de Lugo charitably gave him a sheep to kill according to\r\nhis rites and even himself ate some of the mutton. These petty cases\r\nkept Ximenes busy and he despatched them with promptness; the\r\npunishments as a rule were not severe--in one or two cases scourging or\r\nvergüenza, but mostly small fines, exile and occasionally spiritual\r\npenances.[270]\r\n\r\nThere were, however, cases in which the faith demanded more exemplary\r\nvindication. The island of Grand Canary, from 1523 to 1532, was ravaged\r\nwith pestilence creating great misery. Among other causes of divine\r\nwrath the people included the secret apostasy of the Portuguese New\r\nChristians and of the Moorish slaves, and demanded severe measures for\r\nits repression. It may have been with an idea of placating God that\r\nXimenes, on February 24, 1526, celebrated the first _auto publico\r\ngeneral de fe_ with great solemnity, in which all the nobles of the\r\nisland assisted as familiars. The occasion was impressive, for there\r\nwere seven Judaizers relaxed in person and burnt, there were ten\r\nreconciliations, of which five were of Moorish baptized slaves, four\r\nwere for Judaism and one of a Genoese heretic, in addition to which\r\nthere were two blasphemers penanced.[271]\r\n\r\nThis is the last that we hear of Ximenes, whose place, in 1527, was\r\nfilled by Luis de Padilla, treasurer of the cathedral. For awhile he\r\nimitated his predecessor’s activity and, on June 4, 1530, another\r\noblation was offered to God, in an auto celebrated with the same\r\nostentation as the previous one. This time there were no relaxations in\r\nperson, but there were six effigies burnt of as many Moorish slaves, who\r\nhad escaped and were drowned in their infidelity while on their way to\r\nAfrica and liberty. There were also the effigy and bones of Juan de\r\nTarifa, the husband of the Ynes de Tarifa who had denounced herself in\r\n1524; he was of Converso descent and had committed suicide in prison,\r\nwhich was equivalent to self-condemnation. There were three\r\nreconciliations, of which two were for Judaism and one for Islam and\r\nfive penitents for minor offences.[272] The next auto was held on May\r\n23, 1534, in which there were two relaxations of effigies for Judaism\r\nand twenty-five reconciliations--twenty-four of Moriscos and one of a\r\nJudaizer. One of the relaxations carries with it a warning, for it was\r\nof Costanza Garza, who had died in 1533 during her trial. When too late\r\nher innocence was discovered and the Suprema humanely rehabilitated her\r\nmemory and her children, and ordered the restoration of her confiscated\r\nestate.[273]\r\n\r\nWhether this aggressive vindication of the faith put an end to heresy or\r\nwhether Padilla had exhausted his energies, it would be impossible now\r\nto say, but after this auto the tribunal sank into lethargy so complete\r\nthat on February 8, 1538, the chapter notified Padilla and the\r\nsecretary, Canon Alonso de San Juan, that the revenues of their prebends\r\nwere stopped, for they did not assist in the choir and it was notorious\r\nthat the Holy Office had nothing to do.[274] Possibly this may have\r\nstimulated action, but we have seen that in 1548 the tribunal was merely\r\ncollecting evidence and obeying the instructions of the Seville\r\nInquisition. Under this there was an accumulation of culprits for an\r\nauto held in 1557, where there were seventeen effigies burnt of\r\nfugitives--all Moriscos, except a Fleming, Julian Cornelis Vandyk. There\r\nwere also four Moriscos reconciled, one of them, curiously enough, for\r\nso-called Calvinism.[275] This seems to have exhausted whatever remains\r\nof energy Padilla possessed for we hear of no further action by him,\r\nexcept a quarrel with the royal Audiencia in 1562, but nevertheless the\r\ntribunal shared in the suppression of prebends, and a papal brief\r\nassigning one to it was presented to the chapter, August 27, 1563, thus\r\nadding another efficient cause of dissension between them.[276] Soon\r\nafter this the tribunal virtually ceased to exist. In 1565 there was a\r\ncurious case, of which more hereafter, of John Sanders, an English\r\nsailor. It was carried on wholly by the episcopal provisor, during the\r\nabsence of the bishop Diego Deza. There were arrest, sequestration and\r\nthe collection of voluminous testimony, which was carefully sealed and\r\ndespatched to Bishop Deza, to be handed to the Seville tribunal.\r\nThroughout it all, there is no trace of participation by the local\r\nInquisition, which, in the consuming jealousy of episcopal\r\nencroachments, could not possibly have been the case had there been a\r\ntribunal in the Canaries.[277]\r\n\r\nThe policy followed thus far had evidently proved a failure, and\r\nInquisitor-general Espinosa resolved to reorganize the tribunal and\r\nrender it independent of Seville. The fiscal of Toledo, Diego Ortiz de\r\nFúnez, was selected and was sent out as a full inquisitor, with the\r\nunusual powers of selecting and removing his subordinates, while\r\nsubjected only to the requirement of reporting his acts to the Suprema.\r\nThe royal letters commanding obedience to him are dated October 10,\r\n1567, and he left Madrid in the Spring of 1568, landing at Las Isletas\r\non April 17th. Four days later he started for Las Palmas, accompanied in\r\nprocession by all the dignitaries, secular and ecclesiastical, of the\r\nisland. On May 1st all the population was summoned, under pain of fine\r\nand excommunication, to assemble the next day in the cathedral, at the\r\nreading of the Edict of Faith and to take the oath to obey and favor the\r\nHoly Office, all of which was performed with due solemnity.[278]\r\n\r\nFúnez carried instructions to appoint twenty familiars and no more in\r\nLas Palmas, and such as were found necessary in the other cities and\r\nislands. This was his first care, and he soon had a formidable body,\r\nrecruited from the old nobility, to support his authority. Thus far the\r\nInquisition had had no special habitation, not even a prison, and those\r\nunder trial on the most serious charges were confined in their own\r\nhouses or in the public gaol, where there was no provision for their\r\nsegregation. Fúnez demanded a competent building, with the necessary\r\nconveniences, a demand not easily complied with in so small a place, and\r\nhe finally was installed in the episcopal palace, then vacant through\r\nthe absence of the bishop.[279] This of course could be but temporary\r\nand some other provision must have been made, for we are told that, when\r\nthe Dutch under Pieter Vandervoez, in 1599, took possession of Las\r\nPalmas, they burnt both the episcopal palace and the building of the\r\nInquisition. The former was not rebuilt until thirty years later by\r\nBishop Murga and the latter, as we shall see, was reconstructed in due\r\ntime on a large scale by the tribunal.[280]\r\n\r\nA matter not easily understood is the bestowal, May 25, 1568, on Fúnez,\r\nby the dean and chapter, _sede vacante_, of cognizance of superstitions\r\nand sorcery, because these crimes should not remain unpunished and his\r\npowers as inquisitor were deficient in this respect.[281] These offences\r\nin Spain were recognized as subject to inquisitorial jurisdiction when\r\nsavoring, as they always were assumed to do, of heresy and pact with the\r\ndemon; they formed by far the larger part of the cases coming before the\r\nCanary tribunal and the previous inquisitors had not hesitated to deal\r\nwith them. They formed however a kind of debatable ground, claimed by\r\nboth the secular and spiritual as well as the inquisitorial jurisdiction\r\nand Fúnez may have taken advantage of the impression produced by his\r\nreception to obtain from the chapter, in the absence of a bishop, a\r\ntransfer of its powers.\r\n\r\nFúnez was zealous and energetic in restoring the tribunal to usefulness\r\nand, in about eighteen months, he had accumulated material for an auto\r\nde fe, celebrated November 5, 1569. For this he sent out his\r\nproclamation through all the islands so that, as he boasted to the\r\nSuprema, although the Grand Canary had only fifteen hundred inhabitants,\r\nthere were fully three thousand spectators assembled. The new bishop,\r\nJuan de Azólares, took so warm an interest in the affairs of the\r\nInquisition that he voted personally in all the cases, he walked in the\r\nprocession and he preached the sermon. There were twenty-seven penitents\r\nfor minor offences, involving fines, scourging, galleys and other\r\npenalties, and there were three effigies of Moriscos relaxed. One of\r\nthese represented Juan Felipe, a rich merchant of Lanzarote who, on\r\nlearning that a warrant had been issued for his arrest, chartered a\r\nvessel under pretext of going to Tenerife, on which he embarked with his\r\nwife and children and some thirty of his compatriots, finding a safe\r\nrefuge in Morocco and furnishing material for heightening the interest\r\nof several more autos.[282]\r\n\r\nThe activity of Fúnez was not confined to the Gran Canaria for he made\r\nrepeated visitations to the several islands, gathering in denunciations\r\nfrom all quarters, so that, between May 2, 1568, and January 4, 1571,\r\nthe list of accused amounts to 544 besides a number of collective\r\nentries, such as “_bruxas_,” “the Frenchmen who took the caravel of the\r\nEspinosas,” “renegades,” “Moriscos of Lanzarote,” “fugitive negroes”\r\netc. The names of Englishmen and of an occasional Fleming also begin to\r\nappear. Yet the denunciations consist largely of the veriest trifles of\r\ncareless speech, indicating how acute was the watchfulness excited to\r\nobserve and report whatever might seem to savor of heresy. There was no\r\nsafety in lapse of time, for matters were treasured up to be brought out\r\nlong afterwards, when there was no possibility of disproving them. In\r\nGomera, October 23, 1570, María Machin denounced Catalina Rodríguez for\r\ntelling her of a love-charm some thirty years before; in Garachico,\r\nDecember 21, 1570, Marina Ferrera informs on Vicente Martin, a cleric\r\nwho had gone to the Indies, who told her more than twenty-seven years\r\nbefore of an unnamed woman who had tried on him a conjuration to stop\r\nnose-bleeding. More serious was the accusation brought in Laguna,\r\nJanuary 14, 1571, by Barbolagusta, wife of the Regidor Francisco de\r\nCoronado, against the physician Reynaldos, because, twelve or thirteen\r\nyears before, when the husband of a patient told her to seek the\r\nintercession of the saints, he said that God alone was to be prayed to\r\nand there was no need of saints.[283]\r\n\r\nComplaints of Fúnez must have reached the Suprema for, after a short\r\ninterval, probably in 1570, Doctor Bravo de Zayas was sent out as\r\nvisitador or inspector. He seems to have associated himself\r\ncompanionably with Fúnez as a colleague and, in August, 1571, he made a\r\nvisitation of the islands, bringing back an abundant store of\r\ndenunciations. The two held together an auto on December 12, 1574, in\r\nwhich there was but one relaxation--the effigy of a fugitive Morisco.\r\nFour slaves were reconciled, including a case which is suggestive--that\r\nof a negro of whom it is recorded that he was tortured for an hour, when\r\nthe infliction was stopped because he was so ignorant and stupid. Pious\r\nzeal for the salvation of these poor savages led to their baptism after\r\ncapture; they could not be intelligent converts or throw off their\r\nnative superstitions, and no one seemed able to realize the grim\r\nabsurdity of adding the terrors of the Inquisition to the horrors of\r\ntheir enslaved existence. When a negro slave-girl was bemoaning her\r\ncondition, she was kindly consoled with the assurance that baptism\r\npreserved her and her children from hell, to which she innocently\r\nreplied that doing evil and not lack of baptism led to hell. This was\r\nheresy, for which she was duly prosecuted.[284]\r\n\r\nUnder the inquisitorial code the attempt to escape from slavery thus was\r\napostasy, punishable as such if unsuccessful, and expiated if successful\r\nby concremation in effigy. This is illustrated in an auto, held by Zayas\r\nand Fúnez, June 24, 1576, in which among sixteen effigies of absentees\r\nwere those of eight slaves, seven negroes and one Moor. They had\r\nundergone baptism, had been bought by Doña Catalina de la Cuevas and\r\nwere worked on her sugar plantation. They seized a boat at Orotava and\r\nescaped to Morocco, for which they were duly prosecuted as apostates and\r\ntheir effigies were delivered to the flames--a ghastly mockery which\r\ndoes not seem to have produced the desired impression in preventing\r\nother misguided beings from flying from their salvation.[285]\r\n\r\nWhile Zayas thus coöperated with Fúnez, he did not neglect the special\r\nmission entrusted to him. Charges piled up against Fúnez, which he\r\ncondensed into a series of thirty articles, embracing all manner of\r\nmisdeeds--favoritism, injustice, improper financial transactions,\r\nillicit trading with the Moors of Barbary, ill-treatment of prisoners,\r\nlack of discipline in the tribunal, etc. Zayas and Fúnez seem to have\r\nreturned to Spain towards the close of 1576, for the latter’s defence\r\nagainst the charges is dated at Madrid, February 12, 1577. In this he\r\nanswered all the points in full detail, with citation of documents; the\r\npeople of the islands, he asserts, are given to perjury and, when\r\noffended, bring false accusations to revenge themselves--a habit which,\r\nit may be hoped, he bore in mind when sitting as a judge. Doubtless he\r\nhad given them provocation enough to induce them to exercise their\r\ntalents in this line against him and the numerous charges indicate a\r\nwide-spread feeling of hostility towards the tribunal. His defence was\r\nskilfully drawn and, on its face, seems to be sufficient.[286]\r\n\r\nThe Canary tribunal was thus placed upon the same footing as those of\r\nSpain, though perhaps it was subjected to a somewhat closer supervision\r\nby the Suprema than was as yet exercised at home, for we happen to have\r\na letter of October 11, 1572, ordering that Antonio Lorenzo be released\r\nfrom the secret prison and be given his house as a prison. Perhaps it\r\nfelt that assertion of its authority was necessary, in view of the delay\r\nand uncertainty of communication, for commercial intercourse was not\r\nfrequent; as Fúnez says, about this time, it was notorious that there\r\nwere no vessels sailing for two or three or even more months.[287] Be\r\nthis as it may, there was another visitor sent to the Canaries in 1582,\r\nand a third about 1590. The latter was Claudio de la Cueva, whose\r\nvisitation lasted until 1597 and was useful in exposing the iniquities\r\nof Joseph de Armas, who had served as fiscal for more than twenty years.\r\nA quarrel between him and the secretary, Francisco Ibañez, led to mutual\r\naccusations and the unveiling of secrets which show how the terror\r\ninspired by the Inquisition and the immunity of its officials enabled\r\nthem to abuse their positions. There was a rich and respected Fleming\r\nnamed Jan Aventrot, married to a native widow, who was accused by a\r\nstepdaughter of eating meat on Fridays and saying that meat left no\r\nstain on the soul; also of eating meat in Lent and speaking Flemish.\r\nAventrot was secretly a Protestant, which could readily have been\r\ndeveloped by the ordinary inquisitorial methods, but he escaped with a\r\nreprimand and a fine of 200 ducats.[288] How this happened finds its\r\nexplanation in the fact that, while he was in prison, Armas obtained\r\nfrom him, without payment, a bill of exchange on Seville.[289] He also\r\ndefrauded the revenue by receiving goods imported by an Englishman named\r\nJohn Gache (Gatchell?) and selling them through his brother Baltasar.\r\nHernan Peraza, alguazil of the tribunal, complained that Armas would not\r\npay his debts and so did Daniel Vandama, a Flemish merchant. A harder\r\ncase was that of a chaplaincy in the Inquisition founded by Andrés de\r\nMoron for the benefit of Juan de Cervantes, son of Gaspar Fullana,\r\nauditor of accounts in the cathedral. Armas induced Inquisitor Francisco\r\nMadaleno to take the chaplaincy from Cervantes and give it to him. When\r\nClaudio de la Cueva came, Fullana complained to him and he ordered the\r\nchaplaincy restored and the income accrued during four years, amounting\r\nto 190 doblas, to be refunded. Armas delayed payment for some months and\r\nthen insisted on compromising it for 120 doblas, which Fullana agreed\r\nto, fearing that Armas, who was a canon, would induce the chapter to\r\ndeprive him of his auditorship, but in place of getting money he\r\nreceived orders on parties at a distance. In stating this under\r\nexamination by la Cueva, May 4, 1596, Fullana begged him not to insist\r\non the restitution of the remaining 70 doblas, for Armas was a dangerous\r\nman.[290]\r\n\r\nHe proved so to the convent of la Concepcion, founded by Doña Isabel de\r\nGarfias, a Cistercian nun, whom Cardinal Rodrigo de Castro, Archbishop\r\nof Seville, had sent to Las Palmas for the purpose. Armas persuaded the\r\nbishop, Fernando de Figueroa, to appoint him as visitor of the convent\r\nand used his authority to cultivate a suspicious intimacy with some of\r\nthe younger inmates, to the destruction of discipline and rules of the\r\nOrder. When the abbess endeavored to enforce them, he deposed her and\r\nreplaced her with Francisca Ramírez, a Dominican, who had accompanied\r\nher from Spain, and who was of near kin to Doña Laura Ramírez, his\r\nmistress, by whom he was said to have a child. The abbess appealed to\r\nthe archbishop, who addressed, December 19, 1595, a forcible letter to\r\nthe bishop, recapitulating the misdeeds of Armas and ordering him to\r\ninvestigate and apply the appropriate remedies, but to no purpose, and\r\nthe abbess turned to la Cueva, February 28, 1596, with an earnest\r\nmemorial, imploring his interposition. Armas, she said, desired her\r\ndeath, for when she was sick he would not allow the physician to visit\r\nher, so that she nearly died.[291] A more prominent ecclesiastic who\r\nexperienced the risk of provoking him was the prior of the cathedral,\r\nDoctor Luis Rúiz de Salazar, who was also a consultor of the tribunal.\r\nThey had a quarrel in the chapter; Salazar called him the son of a\r\nclockmaker and, when Armas gave him the lie, Salazar seized his cap and\r\nbeat him with it. Inquisitor Madaleno promptly threw Salazar into prison\r\nand prosecuted him, but, as the affair concerned a church dignitary, he\r\nwas obliged to submit the papers to the Suprema for the sentence. With\r\nunexpected moderation the latter replied, April 2, 1591 that, as the\r\naffair took place in the chapter and in the capacity of canons, the\r\ntribunal must abandon the case and allow it to be decided by whatever\r\njudges had jurisdiction--but it did not prescribe any satisfaction to\r\nSalazar for the infamy inflicted by his imprisonment.[292]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the tribunal had been actively performing such duties as came\r\nin its way, strengthened by the addition of another inquisitor, for, in\r\n1581, we find Fúnez replaced with Diego Osorio de Seijas and Juan\r\nLorenzo, who celebrated a public auto on March 12th of that year. It\r\nwill be remembered that, in the auto of 1569, there appeared the effigy\r\nof Juan Felipe, who had escaped from Lanzarote, carrying with him some\r\nthirty other fugitives. The tribunal had not forgotten them and now,\r\nafter duly trying them it burnt their effigies, to the number of\r\nthirty-one, including Felipe’s wife and sister and three children,\r\nfifteen slaves, mostly negroes and a miscellaneous group of others. In\r\naddition there were fifteen reconciled penitents, with the usual\r\npenalties.[293]\r\n\r\nSix years elapsed before there was another auto, celebrated July 22,\r\n1587, in which there were burnt three effigies of a remnant of the\r\nLanzarote fugitives. There was also the more impressive relaxation of a\r\nliving man--the first since that of the Judaizers in 1526. This was an\r\nEnglishman named George Gaspar who, in the royal prison of Tenerife, had\r\nbeen seen praying with his back to a crucifix and, on being questioned,\r\nhad said that prayer was to be addressed to God and not to images. He\r\nwas transferred to the tribunal, where he freely confessed to having\r\nbeen brought up as a Protestant. Torture did not shake his faith and he\r\nwas condemned, a confessor as usual being sent to his cell the night\r\nbefore the auto to effect his conversion. He asked to be alone for\r\nawhile and the confessor, on his return, found him lying on the floor,\r\nhaving thrust into his stomach a knife which he had picked up in the\r\nprison and concealed for the purpose. The official account piously tells\r\nus that it pleased God that the wound was not immediately mortal and\r\nthat he survived until evening, so that the sentence could be executed;\r\nthe dying man was carted to the _quemadero_ and ended his misery in the\r\nflames. Another Englishman was Edward Francis, who had been found\r\nwounded and abandoned on the shore of Tenerife. He saved his life, while\r\nunder torture, by professing himself a fervent Catholic, who had been\r\nobliged to dissemble his religion, a fault which he expiated with two\r\nhundred lashes and six years of galley service. Still another Englishman\r\nwas John Reman (Raymond?) a sailor of the ship Falcon; he had asked for\r\npenance and, as there was nothing on which to support him in the prison,\r\nhe was transferred to the public gaol. The governor released him and, in\r\nwandering around he fell into conversation with some women, in which he\r\nexpressed Protestant opinions. A second trial ensued in which, under\r\ntorture, he professed contrition and begged for mercy, which he obtained\r\nin the disguise of two hundred lashes and ten years of galleys. In\r\naddition there were the crew of the bark Prima Rosa, twelve in number,\r\nall English but one Fleming. One of them, John Smith, had died in\r\nprison, and was reconciled in effigy; the rest, with or without torture,\r\nhad professed conversion and were sent to the galleys, some of them\r\nwith a hundred lashes in addition. Besides these, this notable auto\r\npresented twenty-two penitents, penanced or reconciled, for the ordinary\r\noffences and with the usual penalties.[294]\r\n\r\nAnother auto was celebrated December 21, 1597, with a large number of\r\npenitents, but no relaxations either in person or in effigy. It was the\r\nlast of these solemnities held in public, for the next one, December 20,\r\n1608, was an _auto particular_, in the cathedral, when three effigies\r\nwere relaxed.[295] In fact, while the Inquisition in Spain was\r\nconsolidating its power and threatening to dominate the monarchy, in the\r\nCanaries there seems to have been an unconscious combination of opposing\r\nforces which crippled its energies and gradually rendered it inert. Yet\r\nduring the early years of the seventeenth century it had vigor enough to\r\nburn two unfortunates alive. Gaspar Nicholas Claysen (Claessens?) a\r\nHollander, had been condemned to a year of prison, in the auto of 1597,\r\nwhen he must have professed conversion. He seems to have imagined that\r\nhe would escape recognition and, in 1611, he tempted his fate again and\r\nsought the Canaries as the captain of a merchant vessel. He was arrested\r\nApril 19th and tried again. In spite of torture he maintained his faith\r\nto the last and, on January 27, 1612, he was sentenced to relaxation, as\r\nan impenitent, by the inquisitors Juan Francisco de Monroy and Pedro\r\nEspino de Brito. Then a delay of two years occurred, possibly occupied\r\nwith efforts for his salvation, and it was not until February 22, 1614,\r\nthat the governor, Francisco de la Rua, was summoned to hear his\r\nsentence and receive him for execution. There was a Dutch ship in the\r\nharbor and many of his compatriots in the town, so that his rescue seems\r\nto have been feared, for such is the reason given for loading him with\r\nchains and guarding him with four soldiers carrying arquebuses with\r\nlighted matches. At the appointed hour he was paraded through the\r\nstreets, under a guard of soldiers, to the plaza de Santo Domingo, where\r\nhe was duly burnt alive. The next year, on June 2, 1615, Tobias\r\nLorenzo, a Hollander settled in Garachico (Tenerife), who had been\r\narrested in 1611, was burnt as a relapsed Protestant.[296]\r\n\r\nThis was the last relaxation in person, making, according to Millares, a\r\ntotal of only eleven since the foundation of the tribunal, but, as he\r\nomits the earliest one, Juan de Xeres, the count amounts to twelve.[297]\r\nAfter this a long interval occurs before there was even an effigy burnt.\r\nDuarte Henríquez Alvarez was a Portuguese New Christian, who was a\r\ncollector of the royal revenues and a rich merchant in Tenerife. In his\r\nfrequent voyages to Europe he fell in love with the daughter of an\r\nAmsterdam correspondent and resolved to marry her and return to the\r\nfaith of his ancestors. He remitted to Holland as much money as he could\r\nwithout exciting suspicion, he abandoned to the Inquisition the rest of\r\nhis considerable property and departed, never to return. He was duly\r\nprosecuted _in absentia_ and condemned to relaxation in effigy.\r\nPermission to execute the sentence in an auto particular was asked of\r\nthe Suprema and its assent was received, May 29, 1659. No time was lost;\r\non June 1st the auto was held in the cathedral; the effigy was delivered\r\nto the corregidor and was solemnly burnt in the quemadero, being the\r\nlast execution in the Canaries.[298] From this time to the end of the\r\ncentury the work of the tribunal was almost nothing, the records of the\r\nprison showing that there were rarely more than one or two\r\nprisoners.[299]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBefore following the history of the tribunal to its decadence and\r\nextinction, we may pause to consider its condition and the various\r\ndirections in which its activity was developed.\r\n\r\nIts financial resources presumably were limited. During the earlier term\r\nof its career, when it had no buildings of its own and no prison to\r\nmaintain, when its officials for the most part were drawn from the\r\nchapter and other beneficed incumbents, an occasional confiscation and\r\nlevying of fines probably met the moderate necessary expenses. In 1563\r\nit had the benefit of a suppressed prebend and when, in 1568, Fúnez was\r\nsent to organize it, the energy of his administration doubtless supplied\r\nthe funds necessary for the establishment which he founded. Imposing\r\nfines, however, probably was easier than collecting them, for when, in\r\n1570, he was about to depart on a visitation of the islands he impressed\r\nupon the fiscal, Juan de Cervantes, that there were many persons who\r\nowed the fines to which they had been condemned and he was especially\r\nempowered to use all the rigor of law in compelling payment.[300] This\r\nseems to have been the only source thus far of funds, for when one of\r\nthe charges against Fúnez, in the visitation, was that he kept no book\r\nfor recording confiscations, his reply, in 1577, was that there had been\r\nnone since that of the Felipes (in 1569) and this was so involved that\r\nhe waited till he could visit Lanzarote and straighten it out.[301]\r\n\r\nA more promising field, however, as we shall see, was now developing in\r\nthe prosecution of heretic merchants and shipmasters who were seeking\r\nthe trade of the Canaries, when a latitudinarian construction of the law\r\npermitted the seizure of vessels and cargoes, on which the grip of the\r\nInquisition was not easily relaxed. Either from this or some other\r\nsource the tribunal was emerging from its poverty, for a stray document\r\nshows us that, in 1602, it was investing 5000 ducats in a ground-rent,\r\nfrom which it was still receiving the income in 1755.[302] We also catch\r\na glimpse of its affairs in 1654, when the Seville Contratacion sent its\r\nfiscal to the Canaries to put a stop to the exportation of wine to the\r\nIndies, the commerce of which was confined to Seville. On June 15th the\r\ntribunal addressed to Philip IV a memorial, arguing that to cut off\r\nthis trade would be the total destruction of the islands, which now pay\r\nthe king 60,000 ducats a year over the expenses of the garrison and\r\njudiciary, for the English took only the malmsey of Tenerife and the\r\nrest of the vintage, amounting to 16,000 pipes per annum, went to the\r\nIndies. The bishopric, now worth 30,000, would not be worth 10,000; as\r\nfor the Inquisition, it held ground-rents on the vineyards paying 22,232\r\nreales and 28 maravedís, which it would lose, and, as its only other\r\nsource, the prebend, was worth only 300 ducats a year, its support would\r\nfall on the king.[303] The only relief obtained from the king was\r\npermission to ship 1000 tuns a year to various American ports. Whether\r\nthe tribunal suffered or not we have no means of knowing, but in 1660 we\r\nfind it gathering in the estate of Duarte Henríquez, burnt in effigy in\r\n1658, and applying 1942 reales from it to the renewal of 212 sanbenitos,\r\nhung in the churches, which had become worm-eaten and indistinct with\r\nage.[304]\r\n\r\nThis does not look as if the tribunal were oppressed with poverty; in\r\nfact it must have enjoyed abundant means for about this time it\r\ncompleted what is described as an imposing palace for its habitation.\r\nThis had a spacious patio, covered with an awning in hot weather, which\r\nled into a handsome garden, opening upon a street in the rear. To these\r\nthe public was freely admitted and they formed a thoroughfare from one\r\nstreet to another, the object of which was to enable witnesses and\r\ninformers to come without attracting attention. In the building were\r\nlodged the senior inquisitor, the gaoler and the subordinate officials,\r\nthe prison and the torture-chamber being in the rear.[305] Later\r\nfinancial data are missing, but the tribunal probably managed to meet\r\nits expenses to the end, with no greater difficulty than those of the\r\nPeninsula. From first to last it was not burdened with a punitive prison\r\nor _casa de la misericordia_, and its sentences to confinement are\r\nalways to convents or to the houses of the culprits or to hold the city\r\nas a prison. The detentive or secret prison was economically\r\nadministered, the ration, as we learn in 1577, being only 24 maravedís a\r\nday. The visitor, Bravo y Zayas, was assailed with many complaints by\r\nthe inmates of insufficient food, which they ascribed to the knavery of\r\nthe officials, but Fúnez explained it by saying that, while in the\r\nCanaries there were usually one or two months of scarcity in a year,\r\nthere had been a famine lasting through 1571, 1572 and 1573, when the\r\nprice of bread went up to a cuarto of six maravedís for two or three\r\nounces and the people were reduced to eating chestnuts; meat was\r\ncorrespondingly scarce and the supply of fish was very uncertain. Rich\r\nand poor suffered alike and, as the prisoners’ allowance was in money,\r\ntheir food was unavoidably diminished.[306]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJudaizing New Christians, who furnished, in the Peninsula, so abundant a\r\nsource of exploitation, formed a comparatively insignificant feature in\r\nthe activity of the Canary tribunal. At first there was better promise,\r\nas we have seen in the statistics of the earlier autos, but these\r\nenergetic proceedings seem either to have driven them away or to have\r\nthoroughly converted them and, in the subsequent period, the cases of\r\nJudaism are singularly few, in so far as we can learn from existing\r\ndocuments. In 1635 there is a denunciation of a Dutchman named Rojel,\r\nwho had been in Tenerife and who subsequently was seen in Holland,\r\ndressed and living as a Jew. In 1636, a man named Mardocheo, aged 80,\r\nresident of La Laguna in Tenerife, was accused of talking Judaism by a\r\nman who had been a fellow-prisoner with him in the public gaol. In 1638\r\nthe Licenciado Diego de Arteaga was suspected of being _de casta de\r\nJudío_, in consequence of irregular conduct in a procession. In 1653,\r\nFrancisco Vicente, a West Indian, who had accompanied his master Diego\r\nRodrigo Arias from Havana to London and thence to Tenerife, denounced\r\nhim for taking a crucifix every night from his chest and flogging it for\r\nhalf an hour. In 1659 we have seen the relaxation in effigy of Duarte\r\nHenríquez Alvarez. In 1660 Fray Matias Pinto accused Antonio Fernández\r\nCarvajal of saying that he was a Jew since Protector Cromwell had broken\r\npeace with Spain. In 1662 Gaspar Pereyra, alias de Vitoria, was\r\nconvicted of Judaism and sent to Seville to serve out his term of\r\nimprisonment. His grandmother had been burnt and his business as a\r\nmerchant had carried him to Brazil, Angola, Lisbon, Madrid, Antwerp,\r\nAmsterdam, Middelburg and many other places, so that he had a\r\ncomprehensive acquaintance with the communities of Jewish refugees\r\neverywhere, and the care with which the minute evidence that he gave\r\nconcerning them was collected and ratified, although they were all out\r\nof reach, shows that the paucity of cases in the records is not the\r\nresult of any lack of desire to persecute. It was natural however that\r\nthe inquisitors should enquire about Gerónimo Gómez Pesoa, a rich Lisbon\r\nmerchant who disappeared just in time to avoid arrest and, as an English\r\nvessel sailed that night without a licence, he was supposed to have\r\nescaped in it--a supposition fortified by learning that he had joined\r\nthe colony of Conversos in Rouen and had thence gone to Amsterdam.[307]\r\nDoubtless there were more cases than these, but the records available do\r\nnot furnish them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring the sixteenth century baptized Moorish and negro slaves furnished\r\na certain amount of business, especially when they escaped and added to\r\nthe impressiveness of the autos with their effigies, but subsequently we\r\nhear little of them. When prosecuted in person it would seem that the\r\nowner was obliged to pay for their maintenance, for a warrant of arrest,\r\nin 1575, of Pedro Morisco manco, slave of Pedro d’Escalona, requires\r\neight ducats to be brought with him, to be furnished by his\r\nmaster.[308] There is one case of a free Morisco which is not easy to\r\nunderstand. About 1590, Sancho de Herrera Leon, with his wife and\r\nchildren, was carried off in a Moorish raid. After a short time he\r\nreturned and, although he asserted that he had come back to preserve his\r\nfaith, he was made to abjure _de levi_, was fined in forty doblas and\r\nwas exiled perpetually from Lanzarote and Fuerteventura, under pain of\r\nscourging and galleys.[309] In the seventeenth century we hear little of\r\nsuch cases, but in 1619 there occurs one which throws some light on the\r\nfate of the Moriscos expelled from Spain in 1610. Juan de Soto, born in\r\nValladolid and brought up as a Christian, was seven years old at the\r\ntime of the expulsion. The family passed into France; at Toulouse his\r\nparents and brothers died, but a kinsman took charge of him and carried\r\nhim to Barbary, where he was circumcised and made to utter certain words\r\nin Arabic. For seven years he served various masters, who carried him\r\ntwice to Constantinople, Alexandria and other places. In 1618 a fleet\r\nsailed from Algiers to the Canaries, in which he served a Turkish\r\ncaptain named Hamet. Sent ashore on Lanzarote with a foraging party and\r\nattacked by the natives, three were killed and he was wounded and\r\ncaptured. The Inquisition claimed him, which was probably fortunate for\r\nhim, for, as a renegade he escaped with reconciliation and four years of\r\nsanbenito and reclusion in a convent.[310]\r\n\r\nRenegades, in fact, were quite numerous, and the facility is noteworthy\r\nwith which Christians when captured abandoned their faith. The tribunal\r\nkept a close watch on them and all who escaped from Barbary were closely\r\nquestioned as to fellow-prisoners who had renegaded, when these could be\r\nprosecuted _in absentia_, or record be kept to confront them in case of\r\ntheir return.[311]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe vast number of denunciations which kept pouring in upon the\r\ntribunal shows how sedulously the population was trained as spies and\r\ninformers upon their neighbors. Many of the alleged offences were of the\r\nmost trivial character, yet they have their interest as an index of the\r\nhypersensitiveness of orthodoxy with which the Spanish mind was imbued.\r\nAmong the cases which Doctor Bravo y Zayas brought home with him for\r\ntrial, from his visitation of the islands in 1571, was that of a man\r\nwho, while dressing himself, was annoyed by the glare of the sun and\r\npettishly exclaimed “Devil take the sun,” which was gravely qualified as\r\nblasphemy. Another who, in a procession, had aided in carrying the frame\r\non which was seated an image of the Virgin, remarked that it was a load\r\nfor a camel, which was decided to be ill-sounding and offensive to pious\r\nears. Even absence of intention did not excuse. In 1591, Gaspar López of\r\nTenerife, when on guard one night, went through the exercise of arms\r\nwith his partizan, in the course of which he happened to strike a wooden\r\ncross that was behind him, and for this he was sentenced to the\r\nindelible disgrace of appearing in an auto, followed by\r\nvergüenza--parading on an ass through the streets, naked from the waist\r\nup, while the town-crier proclaimed his misdeed.[312] This hyperæsthesia\r\ndid not diminish with time. In 1665 the tribunal entertained and\r\ninvestigated an accusation that a certain person when praying allowed\r\nhis rosary to hang down his back, which was regarded as\r\nirreverence.[313]\r\n\r\nHow readily such a system could be abused to gratify malevolence is\r\nindicated in the case of the Dominican Fray Alonso de las Roelas. In\r\nMarch, 1568, he made an utterance about purgatory which excited remark,\r\nand some of his brother frailes discussed it with him, when Fray Blas\r\nMerino, a prominent member of the Order, said that Roelas was simple and\r\ndid not know what he said and that it was not for them to denounce him.\r\nSome years later, however, Blas Merino, in the hope of being made\r\nProvincial, was engaged in a sort of plot to get the Canaries separated\r\nfrom the Province of Andalusia and erected into a province of the Order.\r\nThe Dominican authorities heard of this and Roelas was commissioned to\r\nseize all the papers connected with it and to notify Merino to abandon\r\nthe project. To revenge himself Merino hunted up all the witnesses to\r\nRoela’s utterance and persuaded them to denounce him in 1572. Bishop\r\nAzólares, whose zeal for the Inquisition we have seen, said that the\r\nmatter was not worth prosecuting, because Roelas did not deny purgatory,\r\nwhich was a matter of faith, while its place and the character of its\r\ntorment were matters of debate with theologians. Nevertheless Roelas was\r\narrested and tried, and, as usual during trial, he was recluded in the\r\nconvent of his Order in Las Palmas. One midnight he came knocking at the\r\ndoor of the Inquisition; Fúnez was awakened and sent him word that it\r\nwas no time for him to call and that he could come the next day. He did\r\nso and stated that his brethren so maltreated him, because he had once\r\nserved as inspector of the house, that he asked to be placed in the\r\nsecret prisons, a request which was granted, and he stayed there until\r\nsentenced. The sentence punished him with reclusion and he was delivered\r\nto the prior of the convent, when they at once commenced snarling and\r\ngrowling at each other like quarrelsome dogs. Fúnez rebuked the prior,\r\ntelling him to avoid such public scandals and that he would send Roelas\r\nto the convent in Tenerife until the Provincial should decide as to his\r\nplace of reclusion. Fúnez probably spoke from experience when he said\r\nthat among frailes there was no restraint nor truth, but only envy.[314]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Canaries enjoyed an ample supply of _beatas revelanderas_, but, as a\r\nrule, the tribunal did not follow the example of the Peninsula in\r\nmolesting them. One of the most renowned of these was Catalina de San\r\nMateo, a nun of the house of Santa Clara in Las Palmas, who had\r\necstasies and revelations and was reverenced as a saint. God spoke with\r\nher familiarly through the medium of a painted Ecce Homo, which hung in\r\nher cell, giving her counsels and spiritual comfort and prophecies. On\r\nher death, May 26, 1695, the body lay for three days emitting the odor\r\nof sanctity and was viewed by a vast concourse, eager to touch it with\r\nrosaries and other objects, and all her clothes and effects were\r\ntreasured as relics. All this is described in a letter of July 5th, to\r\nthe Suprema, by the inquisitors Lugo and Romero, who express no doubts\r\nas to her holiness. Commencement was made to collect testimony for her\r\ncanonization, but enthusiasm evaporated and the effort was abandoned.\r\nShe was succeeded in popular veneration by Sor Petronila de San Esteban,\r\nof the convent of San Bernardo in Las Palmas, which she had entered in\r\n1680, at the age of four. She was a bride of God; the child Jesus came\r\nto nestle in her arms; the man Christ came to soothe her with sweet\r\nwords; legions of angels, headed by David, came to rejoice her with the\r\nmusic of heaven. She had terrible conflicts with demons, whom she\r\novercame, and a little wooden image of St. John, with which she held\r\ndiscourse, was the medium through which she enjoyed revelations and\r\nprophecies. The Inquisition took no action to interfere with her and\r\nalmost the only case in which it instituted proceedings, in such\r\nmatters, was one, in 1695, against Don Miguel de Araus, confessor of two\r\nbeatas in La Laguna, Francisca Machado de San José and Margarita de\r\nSanta Teresa, the former of whom boasted of the stigmata.[315]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the later period a very considerable share of the labors of the\r\ntribunal was devoted to cases of “solicitation”--the seduction of women\r\nby their confessors. It was not until 1561 that this crime was subjected\r\nto inquisitorial jurisdiction, under the pretext that it implied\r\nerroneous belief as to the sacrament of penitence, and some time was\r\nrequired to settle the question of including it in the Edict of Faith\r\ncalling for denunciations. The earliest case I have met occurs in 1574,\r\nwhen María Ramos accused her confessor, Fray Pedro Gallego.[316] After\r\nthis they occur with increasing frequency and offenders appear to be\r\ntreated with even more sympathetic leniency than in Spain. There was\r\nmoderate rigor in the sentence of Fray Pedro de Hinojosa, denounced in\r\n1579 by numerous maids, wives and widows, for he was deprived of the\r\nfaculty of hearing confessions, he received a circular discipline in his\r\nconvent and he was recluded for three years in a convent with the\r\ncustomary disabilities.[317] Much less severity was shown, in 1584, to\r\nManuel Gómez Pacheco, priest of Garachico, accused by a number of women,\r\nfor he was only sentenced to abjuration _de levi_, deprivation of\r\nadministering the sacrament of penitence, two months reclusion in a\r\nconvent and some spiritual exercises.[318] The penalties varied with the\r\ndiscretion of the tribunal. About 1590 Fray Antonio Pacheco Sampayo,\r\nagainst whom there were many accusers, was deprived of confessing, had\r\nthree years of reclusion and fifty lashes in his convent, while Andrés\r\nde Ortega, parish priest of Telde, likewise accused by several women,\r\nwas deprived merely of confessing women, fined in twenty ducats and\r\nseverely reprimanded.[319]\r\n\r\nCases grow more frequent with time and, with their increasing frequency,\r\nthe penalties seem to grow less. In 1694 Fray Domingo Mireles was\r\naccused by four women, with details of foul obscenity. He was sentenced\r\nto deprivation of confession and reclusion for four years, but was\r\nallowed to choose his place of retreat. He served out the term, went to\r\nSpain, and returned with a rehabilitation charitably granted by the\r\ninquisitor-general. In 1698 Fray Cipriano de Armas was prosecuted on the\r\nevidence of two women; the case was carried to the end and remitted for\r\ndecision to the Suprema, which ordered its suspension. In two cases in\r\n1742 the sentence was merely deprivation of confessing, six months’\r\nreclusion and five years’ exile from certain places. In 1747 Fray\r\nBartolomé Bello had not only seduced Maria Cabral González, but had\r\nstrangled in his cell a child born to them, after piously baptizing it,\r\nbut when the case reached the Suprema it was suspended. In 1750\r\nFrancisco Rodriguez del Castillo was prosecuted on very serious charges\r\nbut was only suspended for two years from confessing and given some\r\nspiritual exercises. In 1755 there were nine complainants against Fray\r\nFrancisco García Encinoso, who was deprived of confessing and sentenced\r\nto six months’ reclusion, when he was sent to the convent of N. Señora\r\nde Miraflor, with instructions to the superior to keep the matter\r\nprofoundly secret and to treat him well. In 1769 Fray Domingo Matos was\r\nsentenced only to six months’ reclusion and the denial of certain\r\nprivileges, which was subsequently remitted. The sympathy of the\r\ntribunal apparently was exhaustless and frequently resulted in practical\r\nimmunity. In 1785, Fray Joseph Estrada, Franciscan difinidor, was\r\naccused by several women with full details, but the tribunal, on\r\nDecember 7, 1793, suspended the case. Then, in 1804, he was again\r\naccused by a nun in the convent of la Purisima Concepcion of Garachico.\r\nFinally, after twelve years’ delay, on February 28, 1805, the tribunal\r\nordered its commissioner to give him _audiencias de cargos_, or private\r\nexaminations, on report of which the case would be voted on, bearing in\r\nmind the advanced age of the accused and the difficulty of communicating\r\nwith the Suprema, in consequence of the war. This was the last of the\r\nmatter for, on April 9, 1806, the commissioner at Ycod reported the\r\ndeath of the culprit.[320] When so serious an offence was visited so\r\nlightly, we can scarce be surprised that its subjection to inquisitorial\r\njurisdiction failed to check it. There naturally was much difficulty in\r\ninducing women to come forward as accusers, yet the number of\r\ndenunciations was large and steady. Thus, from July 26, 1706, to\r\nFebruary 15, 1708, the total denunciations of all kinds to the tribunal\r\nwas 75; of these only 22 were of men, out of which 7, or practically\r\none-third, were for solicitation.[321]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe bulk of the business of the tribunal consisted in trials for\r\nsorcery, under which term were included all the superstitions, more or\r\nless innocent, employed to cure or to inflict disease, to provoke love\r\nor hatred, to discover theft and to pry into the future, for\r\ntheological ingenuity inferred pact, express or implicit, with the demon\r\nin everything which could be construed as transcending the powers of\r\nnature, except the ministrations of the priest or exorcist. Such a\r\ncommunity as that of the Canaries, in which the primitive magic arts of\r\nthe natives were added to those of their conquerors, and on these were\r\nsuperimposed the beliefs of Moorish and negro slaves, could not fail to\r\naccumulate an incongruous mass of superstitions affecting all the acts\r\nof daily life, and the summaries of cases printed by Mr. Birch afford to\r\nthe student of folk-lore an inexhaustible treasury of curious details.\r\nNo matter what might be the industry of the tribunal in prosecuting and\r\npunishing the practitioners of these arts, it could effect nothing in\r\nrepressing them, or in disabusing popular credulity, for its very\r\njurisdiction was based on the assumption that the powers attributed to\r\nthe sorcerer were real, and he was punished not as an impostor but as an\r\nally or instrument of the demon.\r\n\r\nIt would carry us too far to attempt even a summary of the multitudinous\r\nsuperstitions embalmed in the records, but a couple of cases may be\r\nmentioned which illustrate the popular tendency to ascribe to sorcery\r\nwhatever excited wonder, and also the good sense which sometimes\r\nintervened to protect the innocent. In 1624, Diego de Santa Marta of\r\nGarachico was denounced as a sorcerer to the tribunal in consequence of\r\nhis performance of some tricks with cards. The accusation was\r\nentertained and Fray Juan de Saavedra was ordered to investigate and\r\nreport. He invited Diego to exhibit his skill and the performance took\r\nplace in the cell of the Provincial, Fray Bernardo de Herrera, who was a\r\nconsultor of the Inquisition, with whom were associated Padre Luzena,\r\nregent of the schools, several theological professors and Don Francisco\r\nSarmiento, alguazil of the tribunal. Diego was not aware that he was\r\npractically on trial before this imposing assemblage, and he performed\r\nsome surprising card tricks as well as sundry other juggleries.\r\nFortunately for him the spectators were clear-sighted and Fray Saavedra\r\nreported that it was all a matter of sleight of hand, which could be\r\ndetected by careful observation.[322] More serious was the denunciation,\r\nin 1803, of any one of four women named (apparently the individual was\r\nnot identified) who had, twelve years before, administered to María\r\nSalome some snuff which caused her to bark like a dog. Luckily Doctor\r\nElchantor, the inquisitor-fiscal, had a touch of the rationalism of the\r\nage. He reported that the vomiting and extraordinary movements alleged\r\nmight have been produced by natural causes; that among timid and\r\nignorant women there was a habit of attributing all disease to sorcery;\r\nthat it could not be said that the snuff had been prepared with diabolic\r\narts and that there were no other suspicions against the parties\r\naccused. He therefore advised that the papers be simply filed away, and\r\nin this Inquisitor Borbujo concurred.[323]\r\n\r\nAlthough the term _bruja_, or witch, occasionally appears in the\r\nrecords, there would not appear to be any cases of specific witchcraft.\r\nThe nearest allusions to the Sabbat occur in 1674, when Doña Isabel\r\nYbarra testified that, a year before, Doña Ana de Ascanio told her that\r\nDon Juan de Vargas, now dead, told her that once, in returning home\r\nabout midnight; he encountered a dance of women with timbrels and\r\nlighted candles. In the same year Fray Pablo Guillen deposed that at\r\nmidnight he saw Guillerma Peré naked; she anointed herself and flew\r\nthrough the air with another woman. Connected with this was the\r\nstatement that a son of Juan Hernandez, at midnight, found in the street\r\nDoña Ana María, widow of Captain Juan de Molina, entirely naked. He took\r\nher to her house, when she gave him a garment and begged him to keep\r\nsilence.[324]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor a comparatively brief period the most important work of the tribunal\r\nconcerned the foreign heretics--mostly Englishmen and Flemings, or\r\nrather Hollanders--who frequented the islands, whether for peaceful\r\ncommerce or for piracy. As the port of call in the trade with America,\r\nthe islands were the favorite resort of the sea-rovers of all the\r\nnations at enmity with Spain, that is of nearly all Europe, in hopes of\r\ncapturing some rich galleon or of ravaging some unprotected spot. In\r\n1570, a Norman Huguenot, cruising off Gomera, seized a vessel starting\r\nfor Brazil with forty Jesuit missionaries; he put them all to death and\r\nlanded his other prisoners at San Sebastian, a port of Gomera, which\r\nnext year was sacked by another French corsair.[325] To some extent,\r\ndoubtless, the Inquisition was regarded as a safeguard against such\r\nmarauders. In 1589, an Englishman, captured at Garachico from the ship\r\nof Vincent Pieter the Fleming, was said to have been a pirate who had\r\npillaged in company with other Englishmen, and was brought before the\r\ntribunal, although nothing else was alleged against him. About the same\r\ntime certain French “pirates,” taken on the islet of Graciosa, off\r\nLanzarote, were delivered to the tribunal, when they proved themselves\r\nto be good Catholics by their familiarity with the prayers and other\r\nobservances.[326]\r\n\r\nMuch more serious was the interference of the Inquisition with those who\r\ncame to trade, and it is difficult to understand how Spain could carry\r\non any commerce with foreign nations under the impediments which it\r\ninterposed. The earliest case in the records is one to which allusion\r\nhas already been made, that of John Sanders who, in 1565, came as a\r\nsailor in a vessel from Plymouth, of which the master was James Anthony,\r\nthe cargo consisting of 28 casks of sardines, 20 dozen of calf-skins and\r\na lot of woollen goods, the property of the master and his brother\r\nThomas. On arrival at Las Isletas, as Sanders could speak and write\r\nSpanish, Anthony got him to enter the goods as his own and installed him\r\nin a shop to sell them. After two or three months, one day the public\r\nscrivener, Melchor de Solis, came and demanded three reales, which\r\nSanders refused. While they were talking he placed his hand on the wall,\r\nwhere there was hanging a paper print of Christ, which he had not\r\nrecognized, as its face was turned to the wall and it was partly torn.\r\nPassing his hand over it, a piece fell off, when Solis charged him with\r\ntearing an image of Christ; he picked it up, reverently kissed it and\r\nreplaced it. The story spread and caused scandal; in the abeyance of the\r\ntribunal, the provisor took up the matter, arresting Sanders March 29th\r\nand sequestrating the property, which consisted of 2492 reales in money,\r\n3-1/2 casks of sardines and 2-1/2 dozen of calf-skins, all of which was\r\nduly placed in the hands of the secrestador, and, in addition, Leónez\r\nAlvarez testified that he had bought and paid for goods to the amount of\r\n340 ducats. Under examination Sanders professed himself a Catholic; he\r\ncould recite the Pater Noster and Credo and the Ave Maria without the\r\nfinal clause imploring the prayers of the Virgin, which he said he had\r\nnever been taught; he could cross himself but did not know the peculiar\r\nSpanish form; he reverenced images of saints although the Queen of\r\nEngland had banished from the churches all but those of Christ and the\r\nVirgin, and he had attended mass since he came. Then James Anthony came\r\nforward and claimed the property, confirming the story of Sanders, and\r\nit was delivered to him, but not until he had furnished satisfactory\r\nsecurity to abide the result. What was the outcome we have no means of\r\nknowing, as the papers were sent to the tribunal of Seville for its\r\naction, but the least that could happen to Sanders and Anthony was\r\ninterminable delay.[327]\r\n\r\nTrading with the Canaries evidently was a hazardous business and the\r\ndanger increased as time went on, for it sufficed that the crew were\r\nheretics to justify their trial and punishment, with the accompaniment\r\nof sequestration and confiscation. Thus on April 24, 1593, a single vote\r\nordered the arrest with sequestration of the pilot and other officers,\r\nthe sailors and boys and passengers of the ship named El Leon Colorado\r\nand of all who came in the ship named San Lorenzo, both now at anchor in\r\nthe port of Las Isletas.[328] The case of the Leon Colorado is\r\nsuggestive. She was an English ship which, until 1587, had been employed\r\nin the Lisbon trade under a licence from the Marquis of Santa Cruz, but\r\nafter his death she seems to have been transferred to Flanders. On this\r\nvoyage she had sailed from Antwerp, a Spanish port, under a licence from\r\nAlexander of Parma, the nephew of Philip II and the governor of the Low\r\nCountries. The _escrivano_ or purser of the ship, Franz Vandenbosch,\r\nwhile on trial, procured a certificate from the municipal authorities of\r\nAntwerp setting forth that his parents were good Catholics and so were\r\ntheir children, and that Franz had sailed for the Canaries with the\r\nlicence and passport of the Duke of Parma. The only effect of this was a\r\nvote to torture him, on learning which he confessed that in Mecklenburg\r\nhe had embraced Calvinism, and his sentence was reconciliation and\r\nconfiscation, prison and sanbenito for three years and perpetual\r\nprohibition to visit heretic lands or to approach within ten leagues of\r\nthe sea, for which reason he was to be sent to Spain. Another member of\r\nthe crew Georg Van Hoflaquen asserted his Catholicism and adhered to it\r\nthrough four successive inflictions, each of three turns of the\r\n_cordeles_. Then he was ordered to be placed on the _burro_ or rack,\r\nwhen he declared that he could no longer endure the agony and that he\r\nwas a heretic. He was sentenced to reconciliation and confiscation, and\r\nthree years of prison and sanbenito, with the corresponding\r\ndisabilities.[329]\r\n\r\nIn these cases the adverse evidence is almost wholly derived from other\r\nmembers of the crews, who had no hesitation in testifying to their\r\ncomrades’ Protestantism. There was usually no concealment attempted but,\r\nwhen orthodoxy was asserted, torture was unsparingly employed.\r\nConversion did not obtain much alleviation of punishment. Another of the\r\ncrew of the Leon Colorado was Jacob Banqueresme, a Hollander, who freely\r\nadmitted his Calvinism. He knew nothing of Catholicism but was ready to\r\nembrace it if it seemed to him good. Theologians were set to work and,\r\nin due time, he announced his conversion and was formally admitted to\r\nthe Church, but he was sentenced to be sent to Spain and confined in a\r\nconvent for two years, in order to be thoroughly instructed, and he was\r\nprohibited to go to heretic lands or to approach the sea within ten\r\nleagues.[330]\r\n\r\nThe result of these labors was seen in the auto of 1597, in which there\r\nwere seventeen Englishmen and Flemings reconciled, with imprisonment\r\nranging from two to eight years, and twenty-six penanced, with from one\r\nto four years of prison, the ships to which they belonged being La Rosa,\r\nSan Pedro, La Posta, San Lorenzo, Leon Colorado, Margarita and María\r\nFortuna.[331] There were no obstinate heretics and no martyrs. When this\r\nactive proselytism was carried on for twenty years or more with its\r\nconsequent confiscation of ships and cargoes, it is easy to understand\r\nthe financial ease of the tribunal and to conjecture its influence on\r\nthe commerce and prosperity of the islands.\r\n\r\nThis flourishing industry was interfered with by the treaty with England\r\nratified by James I on August 29/19, 1604, and by Philip III on June 16,\r\n1605. It provided that English subjects visiting or resident in the\r\nSpanish dominions were not to be molested on account of their religion,\r\nso long as they gave no occasion for scandal, and this was extended to\r\nthe United Provinces in the twelve years’ truce, concluded in 1609.[332]\r\nThe caution induced by the treaty, even before its ratification by\r\nSpain, is exemplified in the case of Edward Monox, an English captain\r\nand merchant, charged September 10, 1604, with offences in the matter of\r\nimages and with following the doctrines of Luther and Calvin. The\r\nconsulta de fe, September 11th, unanimously voted his arrest with\r\nsequestration but that, before action, the papers be sent to the Suprema\r\nfor its decision, in view of the considerations of state arising from\r\nthe peace with England, and from the fact that he was a rich merchant\r\nwho, since the death of Queen Elizabeth, had twice come with highly\r\ncommendatory passports from the Spanish ambassador in London.[333]\r\n\r\nWhile thus some wholesome restraint was imposed on the Inquisition and\r\nthe vexations inflicted on merchants and seamen became much less\r\nfrequent, they did not wholly cease, for the Suprema construed the\r\ntreaties arbitrarily in such wise as to limit the privileges of foreign\r\nheretics as far as possible. How it still continued to throw obstacles\r\nin the way of trade may be seen in the petition of Jacob and Conrad de\r\nBrier and Pieter Nansen, merchants of Tenerife, presented May 3, 1611.\r\nThe ship Los Tres Reyes arrived at Las Isletas with some goods for them;\r\nfor some reason, not stated, it had been seized by the tribunal and its\r\ncargo had been sequestrated and they sought release of their property.\r\nTheir prayer was granted and, on May 25th, an order was given to deliver\r\nto their agent the packages specified and their letters, subject however\r\nto the payment of the cost of disembarking the goods, the carriage to\r\nLas Palmas, the fees of the secrestador for keeping them, 24 reales to\r\nthe interpreter of the tribunal for his trouble, 18 ducats 4 reales for\r\nthe freight and 10 reales average to the ship, at the rate of one real\r\nper package.[334]\r\n\r\nWhen war broke out with England, lasting from 1624 to 1630, of course\r\nthe treaty of 1604-5 became dormant, but it was not until April 22,\r\n1626, that a royal proclamation of non-intercourse with England\r\nappeared, confiscating all English goods imported in contravention of\r\nit, and this was followed, May 29th, by a _carta acordada_ of the\r\nSuprema ordering the prosecution, in the regular way, of all Englishmen\r\nwho had been delinquent as regards the faith.[335] This led to a\r\ndiscussion between the three inquisitors. Francisco de Santalis\r\npresented a long opinion to the effect that in Tenerife there were very\r\nmany of them who, in spite of the war, remained, in place of departing\r\nas enemies. The orders of the Suprema were therefore applicable to them;\r\nCatholics incurred the risk of excommunication in supplying them with\r\nfood and were exposed to the danger of infection; they were delinquents\r\nin not hearing mass or confessing and communing, and in eating meat on\r\nfast days. This was not only a great scandal, but it afforded\r\nopportunity of flight and of concealing their property, which was\r\nlarge. He therefore voted that secret information be taken as to their\r\ndelinquencies and, when this was sufficient, that they should all be\r\narrested and their property be sequestrated, after which the orders of\r\nthe Suprema could be awaited as to their prosecution. The other two\r\ninquisitors, Alonso Rincon and Gabriel Martínez, referred to a\r\nconsultation had on September 2d with the Ordinary, the consultors, and\r\nthe calificadores, when it was resolved that the matter be referred to\r\nthe Suprema and no action be taken till its orders were received; the\r\nroyal proclamation had said nothing about residents; to seize them and\r\ntheir property would be a great hardship; the commissioners at La\r\nLaguna, Orotava and Garachico had been instructed to be vigilant and no\r\ndenunciations had been received. It is creditable to the tribunal that\r\nit resisted the temptation of seizing the large amount of property\r\ninvolved, and the English appear not to have been molested.[336]\r\n\r\nYet the position of the foreign merchants was exceedingly precarious, as\r\nis shown by the case of John Tanner, prior to these deliberations. He\r\nwas arrested and brought to the prison, November 12, 1624. On\r\nexamination he stated his age as 22; he was a baptized Christian, who\r\nkept feast-days and Sundays, but did not hear mass or confess, for in\r\nhis country there was no mass or confession; he knew nothing of the\r\nCatholic faith and had never been instructed in it. When asked as usual\r\nif he knew the cause of his arrest he said that he did not, unless it\r\nwas because Juan Jánez, the commissioner at Garachico, had asked him for\r\nsome linens and a pair of wool stockings which he refused, when Jánez\r\ncalled him a heretic dog and they came to blows, and then he was thrown\r\ninto the public gaol. On being told, as usual, to search his memory, he\r\nadded that once he went with some other Englishmen to La Laguna to see\r\nDon Rodrigo de Bohórquez, then governor of Tenerife; he asked Bohórquez\r\nto pay him 400 pesos owing to him and 2800 reales due to Robert Spencer\r\nfor goods taken, when Bohórquez grew angry and said that Henry Ysan was\r\nthe cause of all the English making demands upon him; if he had hanged\r\nhim while in his power there would be none of this and he was a heretic\r\ndog, for no one could be a Christian who was not a Roman. Tanner replied\r\nthat one could be a Christian without being a Roman, when Bohórquez\r\ncalled for witnesses and swore that he should suffer for it. Tanner was\r\nthen asked what he meant by saying that one could be a Christian without\r\nbeing a Roman, when he fell on his knees and begged mercy if he had\r\nerred. He was a poor youth and had a ship lying at Garachico, on which\r\nhe had to pay demurrage of 120 reales a day, while the embargo on his\r\nproperty prevented his despatching her. At a second audience on November\r\n19th he again begged mercy on his knees; his credit was being ruined by\r\nthe demurrage on his ship, and the loss fell on his principal. Then, on\r\nthe 23d, he asked for an audience in which he represented that the ships\r\nwere loading and preparing to sail, while his was idle; his whole career\r\nwas being wrecked; he begged them for the love of God to have mercy on\r\nhim and tell him what he had done; he had lived in the religion of his\r\nfathers and must continue to do so, or he could not return to England;\r\nhe had engaged to serve his master for seven years and his parents were\r\nunder bonds for him. The pleadings of the poor wretch were fruitless;\r\nthe case dragged on through the customary formalities and, on February\r\n11, 1625, the consulta de fe voted that he be absolved _ad cautelam_ and\r\nbe recluded for two years in a convent for instruction, at the\r\nexpiration of which he must bring a certificate of improvement. In\r\naccordance with this, on February 18th, he was placed in the Franciscan\r\nconvent, his maintenance being paid for as a pauper.[337] Proselytism\r\nafter this fashion can scarce have conduced to the salvation of souls,\r\nhowever much it may have replenished the treasury of the Holy Office.\r\n\r\nWith the peace of 1630 the provisions of 1604 were revived but hardly a\r\nyear passed in which some Englishman was not thrown in prison and\r\nprosecuted on one pretext or another, as Roderick Jones, in 1640, for\r\nsaying that God alone is to be prayed to, and Edward Bland, in 1642, for\r\nhaving a Bible in his house.[338] In spite of this the flourishing\r\nwine-trade of the islands brought many English and Hollanders as\r\nresidents, and there was even an English company established at\r\nTenerife, where, in 1654, the tribunal reported that there were more\r\nthan fifteen hundred Protestants domiciled, who were prevented from\r\ninfecting the people by its incessant vigilance. The captains-general\r\nusually sought to protect them, and the influence of their ambassadors\r\nin Madrid was invoked on occasion, but, when one fell sick, the\r\nInquisition sought to isolate him from his family and friends and put\r\nhim in charge of theologians to convert him, giving rise to unseemly\r\ncontests in which it was not always successful. To remedy this the\r\ntribunal, September 18, 1654, asked of the Suprema power to insist that\r\nwhen one of the rich Protestant residents fell sick, his compatriots\r\nshould be excluded and entrance should alone be permitted to learned\r\nCatholics who might wean him from his errors.[339] We should probably do\r\nno injustice to the motives of the tribunal in assuming that this was\r\ndictated rather by the expectation of pious bequests than by zeal for\r\ndeath-bed conversions.\r\n\r\nForeigners sometimes sought to avert trouble by pretending Catholicism\r\nand thus placed themselves in the power of the tribunal, which was\r\nconstantly on the watch for them. In 1654, for instance, Fray Luis de\r\nBetancor was summoned and interrogated as to his knowledge of such\r\ncases, to which he replied that, some twelve years before, Evan Pugh, an\r\nEnglish surgeon, had come to Adeje to cure Doña Isabel de Ponte, and\r\nsometimes went out to hunt with her brother Juan Bautista de Ponte. He\r\nremembered that one day, when he had finished celebrating mass, he was\r\ntold that Pugh had stood at the church-door with his hat in his hand,\r\nand it was currently said that he confessed to Fray Juan de Medina.\r\nSimilarly, in 1674, we find the Hollander Pieter Groney testifying that\r\nwhen he sailed from the Texel in 1671 Juan de Rada was a\r\nfellow-passenger, who told him he was a Protestant and as such joined in\r\nthe services during the voyage, but, when the ship was visited on\r\narrival he swore that he was a Catholic and had since then acted\r\nexteriorly as a Catholic, though, when they lived together for a couple\r\nof months, he ate meat freely on fast days and he regarded him as a\r\nProtestant rather than as a Catholic.[340] What was the outcome in these\r\ncases cannot be told, but the investigations illustrate the careful\r\nwatchfulness of the tribunal and the dangers incurred by residence\r\nwithin its jurisdiction. Even his official position did not protect from\r\nprosecution Edmund Smith, the British consul at Tenerife, when he was\r\naccused, in 1699, of maltreating converts to Catholicism and of\r\npersuading and threatening those inclined to it, even, it was said,\r\nshipping them away when other measures failed.[341]\r\n\r\nIn the 18th century, while foreign vessels were closely watched and a\r\nvigilant eye was kept on resident Protestants, they were no longer\r\nmolested with investigations and denunciations. If, in 1728, Philip V\r\nordered the expulsion of all foreigners, it was not on religious\r\ngrounds, but to put an end to frauds on the revenue. None, however, were\r\nexpelled, although some professed conversion to save themselves from\r\nannoyance.[342] A similar impulse seems to have impelled Dr. James\r\nBrown, a physician of Tenerife, who wrote, in March, 1770, to the\r\ntribunal, from the Augustinian convent of La Laguna, in which he had\r\nsought asylum from the captain-general, who was seeking to seize him and\r\nsend him to England. To secure its protection he asserted his desire to\r\nabjure his errors and to be received into the Catholic Church, but in\r\nthis he failed for, on July 14, he was ordered to leave the islands\r\nwithin forty days.[343]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe intellectual activity of the Canaries was not such as to call for\r\nmuch vigilance of censorship, at least during the earlier period. The\r\n_visitas de navíos_, or examination of ships arriving, for heretics and\r\nheretic books, was performed after a fashion, but the tribunal was\r\ninadequately equipped for the duty. One of the charges against\r\nInquisitor Fúnez, in 1577, was his sending the gaoler to perform it, to\r\nwhich he replied that he had done so but once and that on occasions he\r\nhad sent the fiscal or the secretary; it was not his business and he had\r\nno one to whom to depute it.[344]\r\n\r\nTowards the middle of the seventeenth century there was some little\r\nactivity with regard to the foreign Protestants, who were assumed to be\r\nsubject to the rules of the Index. The prosecution of Edward Bland, in\r\n1642, for possessing a Bible, seems to have attracted attention to this\r\nand, on July 5, 1645, the tribunal ordered its commissioner at Orotava\r\nto take the alguazil, notary and two familiars and visit the houses of\r\nthe English heretics, secretly, without disturbance and with much\r\ndiscretion, asking them to exhibit all the books they possessed,\r\nexamining all their chests and packages, making an inventory of all\r\nbooks and their authors, and making them swear before the notary as to\r\ntheir having licences to hold them; also whether they had been examined\r\nby the Inquisition and, if so, at what time and by what officials. If\r\nthere were works by prohibited authors, or such as had not been seen by\r\nthe Inquisition, they were to be deposited with a suitable person,\r\nsending a report to the tribunal, with lists of the books, and awaiting\r\nits action. If portraits or busts of heresiarchs were found they were to\r\nbe seized and deposited with the books.\r\n\r\nUnder these elaborate instructions the search was duly made and the\r\nreports, if truthful, would indicate that literature and art were not\r\nextensively cultivated by the English traders. Nothing dangerous was\r\nfound, though of course, as regards English books, the investigators had\r\nto accept the word of the owners. In one house they describe, as hanging\r\non the walls of a room, very ugly half-length portraits of a strange\r\ncollection of worthies--Homer, Apelles, Philo Judæus, Aristotle, Seneca,\r\nPliny, two of Gustavus Adolphus and one without a name. It is perhaps\r\nsignificant that nowhere was there a Bible, a prayer-book or a work of\r\ndevotion. The houses of two Portuguese traders were similarly\r\ninspected, where were found pictures of saints and of damsels with\r\nexuberant charms; also of Barbarossa and of some other pirates.[345]\r\nPossibly supervision of this kind may have continued for, on June 7,\r\n1663, Richard Guild was summoned to the tribunal to describe six English\r\nbooks and four pamphlets, found in possession of Edward Baker, when\r\namong them there proved to be several controversial works as to\r\nPresbyterianism and the Independents. So, in 1670, Captain Joseph\r\nPinero, a Portuguese, who was building a ship, was denounced for the\r\nmore dangerous offence of having some Jewish books, but diligent search\r\nfailed to discover them.[346]\r\n\r\nBooks, however, were not the only objects of censorial animadversion. In\r\n1671 some plates and jars with figures of Christ, the Virgin and the\r\nsaints, sold by Juan Martin Salazar of Ycod, were apparently deemed\r\nirreverent, as subordinating the divine to the commonplace of daily\r\nlife, and Fray Lucas Estebes was ordered to go to his shop, with\r\nalguazil and notary, and break the stock on hand, at the same time\r\nascertaining the name of the seller and of all purchasers. Soon after\r\nthis, in 1677, an edict was issued ordering the surrender of some\r\nsnuff-boxes, brought by an English vessel, which were adorned with two\r\nheads--one with a tiara and the legend _Æcclesia perversa tenet jaciem\r\ndiaboli_, and the other of a philosopher and the motto _Stulti sapientes\r\naliquando_.[347]\r\n\r\nIn the latter half of the eighteenth century there seems to be more\r\nintellectual activity and desire to seek forbidden sources of knowledge,\r\nfor we begin to hear of licences to read prohibited books. A register of\r\nthem, commencing in 1766, shows that when obtained from the\r\ninquisitor-general they had to be submitted to the tribunal for its\r\nendorsement, but it could exercise the discretion of suspending and\r\nprotesting, as in the case of one granted, in 1786, by Pius VI and\r\nendorsed by Inquisitor-general Rubin de Cevallos, to Fray Antonio\r\nRamond, on which the tribunal reports that he ought not to have it, as\r\nhe is of a turbulent spirit and disorderly life. Licences generally made\r\nexception of certain specified books and authors, but sometimes they\r\nwere granted without limitation. When the holder of a licence died, it\r\nwas, as a rule, to be returned to the tribunal.[348]\r\n\r\nAt this period the main activity of the tribunal was in its function of\r\ncensorship. It did not content itself with awaiting orders but assumed\r\nto investigate for itself; nothing escaped its vigilance, and we are\r\ntold that the monthly lists which it forwarded to the Suprema of the\r\nbooks denounced or suppressed are surprising as coming from a province\r\nso small and so uncultured. In fact, in 1781 it expressed its grief that\r\ngreat and small, men and women, were abandoning themselves to reading,\r\nespecially French books.[349] To do it justice it labored strenuously to\r\ndiscourage culture and to perpetuate obscurantism.\r\n\r\nYet the _visitas de navíos_, as described in a letter of August 23,\r\n1787, were less obstructive to commerce than the practice in Spain. When\r\na vessel cast anchor, after the visit of the health officer, the captain\r\nlanded and, in company with the consul of his nation, went to the\r\nmilitary governor, and then to the Inquisition where, under oath, he\r\ndeclared his nationality, his port of departure and what passengers and\r\ncargo he brought. When the vessel was discharging, the secretary of the\r\ntribunal superintended the process and noted whatever he deemed\r\nobjectionable, whence it often happened that matters adverse to religion\r\nwere seized.[350]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all vigilance, however, the dangerous stuff found\r\nentrance. The works of Voltaire and Rousseau were widely read among the\r\neducated class and the hands of the tribunal were practically tied. It\r\nwould laboriously gather testimony and compile a _sumaria_ against one\r\nwho read prohibited books, only to be told, when submitting it to the\r\nSuprema, to suspend action for the present. In a letter of May 24, 1788,\r\nit complained bitterly of this and of the consequent diminution of\r\nrespect for the Inquisition. Chief among the offenders were the\r\nCommandant-general and the Regent of the Audiencia, whose cases had been\r\nsent on April 26th. Their openly expressed contempt for the tribunal\r\nperverted the whole people, who laughed at censures and read prohibited\r\nbooks. An object of especial aversion was the distinguished historian of\r\nthe Canaries, José de Viera y Clavijo, Archdeacon of Fuerteventura. His\r\nsermons had caused him to be reprimanded repeatedly and, when his\r\nhistory appeared with its explanation of the apparition of the Virgen de\r\nCandelaria and other miracles of the Conquest, and its account of the\r\ncontroversies between the chapter and the tribunal, the indignation of\r\nthe latter was unbounded. A virulent report was made to the Suprema,\r\nSeptember 18, 1784, which remained unanswered. Another was sent,\r\nFebruary 7, 1792, complaining of the evil effect of allowing the\r\ncirculation of such writings, but this failed to elicit action, for the\r\nwork was never placed on the Index.[351]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been its deficiencies in other respects, the tribunal\r\nseems never to have lost sight of its functions in fomenting discord\r\nwith the authorities, secular and ecclesiastical. In 1521 we hear of\r\nInquisitor Ximenes excommunicating some of the canons, in consequence of\r\nwhich the chapter withdrew the revenue of his prebend and sent a special\r\nenvoy to the court, but he appealed to Rome and a royal cédula of July\r\n8, 1523, ordered the chapter to make the payments.[352] Even during the\r\ninertness of Padilla’s later inquisitorship, he had sufficient energy to\r\ncarry on a desperate quarrel with the Audiencia. He ordered the deputy\r\ngovernor, Juan Arias de la Mota, to arrest Alonso de Lemos, who had been\r\ndenounced to the tribunal and, on his obeying, the Audiencia arrested\r\nand prosecuted him, which led to an envenomed controversy in which\r\nexcommunications and interdict were freely employed, until Philip II,\r\nFebruary 16, 1562, ordered the liberation of Arias, adding an emphatic\r\ncommand in future to give to the inquisitor and his officials all the\r\nfavor and aid that they might require in the discharge of their duties\r\nand to honor them as was done everywhere throughout his dominions. It\r\nwas doubtless in the hope of putting an end to these unseemly\r\ndisturbances that Philip, by a cédula of October 10, 1567, prescribed\r\nrules for settling competencias, or conflicts over jurisdiction. The\r\ninquisitor and the Regent of the Audiencia were required to confer,\r\nwhen, if they could not come to an agreement, the bishop was to be\r\ncalled in, when the majority should decide.[353]\r\n\r\nNo regulations were of avail to prevent the dissensions for which all\r\nparties were eager and which were rendered especially bitter by the\r\ndomineering assumption of superiority by the Inquisition. It was not\r\nlong after Fúnez had reorganized the tribunal that he became involved in\r\nan angry controversy with Bishop Cristóbal Vera. Alonso de Valdés, a\r\ncanon, incurred the episcopal displeasure by removing his name from an\r\norder addressed to the chapter for the reason that he was not present.\r\nVera thereupon imprisoned him _incomunicado_ so strictly that his food\r\nwas handed in to him through a window. It chanced that Valdés was also\r\nnotary of the tribunal and Fúnez claimed jurisdiction, but the bishop\r\nrefused to surrender him, in spite of the fact that the absence of its\r\nnotary impeded the Inquisition. The tribunal complained to the Suprema\r\nwhich came to its aid in a fashion showing how complete was the\r\nascendancy claimed over the episcopal order, and how little chance a\r\nbishop had in a contest with such an antagonist. Inquisitor-general\r\nQuiroga wrote to Vera that, if the fault of Valdés was such that he\r\nshould punish it, this should have been done in such wise as not to\r\nimpede the operation of the tribunal. He hoped that already the case\r\nwould have been handed over to the tribunal to which it belonged and\r\nthat in future Vera would not give occasion for such troubles. This was\r\nenclosed in a letter of instructions from the Suprema prescribing the\r\nutmost courtesy and the most vigorous action. Fúnez is to call, with a\r\nwitness, on the bishop and demand the person of Valdés and the papers\r\nin the case, as being his rightful judge, at the same time promising his\r\npunishment to the bishop’s satisfaction. If Vera refuses, Quiróga’s\r\nletter is to be handed to him, and if he still refuses he is to be told\r\nthat he obliges the tribunal to proceed according to law.\r\n\r\nThis so-called law is that the fiscal shall commence prosecution against\r\nthe bishop and his officials for impeding the Inquisition. Then the\r\ninquisitor is to issue his formal mandate against the provisor,\r\nofficials, gaolers, etc., ordering them, under pain of major\r\nexcommunication and 200 ducats without further-notice, to surrender\r\nValdés within three days to the tribunal for punishment, so that he can\r\nresume his office of notary. If this does not suffice, a similar mandate\r\nis to be issued against the bishop, under pain of privation of entering\r\nhis church. If the provisor and officials persist in disobedience\r\nthrough three _rebeldias_ (contumacies of ten days each), the inquisitor\r\nshall proclaim them excommunicated. If the bishop is stubborn he is to\r\nbe prohibited from entering his church and to be admonished that if he\r\ndoes not comply he will be suspended from his orders and fined. If he\r\nperseveres through three _rebeldias_, letters shall be issued declaring\r\nhim to have incurred these penalties and admonishing him to obey within\r\nthree days under pain of major excommunication. If still contumacious,\r\nletters shall be issued declaring him publicly excommunicated and\r\nsubject to the fine, which shall be collected by levy and execution. In\r\nall this he is not to be inhibited from cognizance of the case, but only\r\nthat he must not impede the Inquisition by detaining its notary, and, as\r\nit is very possible that he may seek the aid of the Audiencia, if it\r\nintervenes it is to be notified of the royal cédula (of 1553)\r\nprohibiting all interference in cases concerning the Inquisition.[354]\r\n\r\nThis portentous document was received in the tribunal, April 11, 1577.\r\nIt was impossible to contend with adversaries armed with such weapons\r\nand Bishop Vera was obliged to submit. Not content with its triumph the\r\ntribunal undertook to humiliate him still further. Doña Ana de Sobranis\r\nwas a mystic who believed herself illuminated and gifted with miraculous\r\npowers. In 1572 she had denounced herself because a Franciscan, Fray\r\nAntonio del Jesús, had given her, as he said by command of God, nine\r\nconsecrated hosts, which she carried always with her and worshipped. The\r\ntribunal took the hosts and dismissed the case but, as the bishop was\r\nher warm admirer and extolled her virtues, to mortify him, in 1580, the\r\nfiscal presented a furious accusation against her, as a receiver and\r\nfautor of heretics and heresies. She was arrested and imprisoned, but\r\nthe tribunal had overreached itself. She had friends who appealed to the\r\nSuprema and, in May, 1581, there came from it a decision ordering a\r\npublic demonstration that she was innocent and that there had been no\r\ncause for her arrest.[355]\r\n\r\nUndeterred by the fate of Bishop Vera, his successor Fernando de\r\nFigueroa, about 1590, had a lively struggle with the tribunal. He\r\nexcommunicated Doctor Alonso Pacheco, regidor of the Grand Canary and\r\ndeputy governor of Tenerife, because he would not abandon illicit\r\nrelations with a married woman. The tribunal intervened and evoked the\r\ncase, giving rise to a prolonged competencia, which remained undecided\r\nin consequence of the death of the culprit.[356] Causes of such strife\r\nwere never lacking and the first half of the seventeenth century was\r\nlargely occupied by them and by an endless struggle to compel the\r\nchapter to allow to the inquisitors cushioned chairs in the\r\ncathedral.[357] On one occasion, in 1619, the chapter offended the\r\ntribunal by obeying a royal cédula and disregarding a threat which\r\nenjoined disobedience. The canons were thereupon excommunicated and\r\nappealed to the king, who found himself obliged to withdraw the\r\ncédula.[358] The overbearing conduct of the tribunal produced a chronic\r\nfeeling of exasperation and the veriest trifle was sufficient to cause\r\nan outbreak. One custom provocative of much bad blood was that of\r\nselecting in Lent a fishing-boat and ordering it to bring its catch to\r\nthe Inquisition, when, after supplying the officials and prisoners, if\r\nthere was anything left it might be sold to the people. In 1629 the\r\nmunicipality fruitlessly complained of this to the visitor Juan de\r\nEscobar, and in 1631 there was an explosion. The Audiencia rudely\r\nintervened by throwing in prison Bartolomé Alonso, the luckless master\r\nof a boat selected, and threatening to scourge him through the streets.\r\nHe managed to convey word to the tribunal, which at once sent its\r\nsecretary Aguilera to the Audiencia, with a message asking the release\r\nof Alonso, but the Audiencia refused to receive anything but a written\r\ncommunication and Aguilera came back with a mandate requiring obedience\r\nunder pain of two hundred ducats, but he was received with insults and\r\nAlonso was publicly sentenced to a hundred lashes. Then the tribunal\r\ndeclared the judges excommunicate, displayed their names as such in the\r\nchurches and had the bells rung. The Audiencia disregarded the censures\r\nand arrested Aguilera, while the Alcaide Salazar, who had accompanied\r\nhim, hid himself, but the Audiencia ordered a female slave of his to be\r\nseized and his house to be torn down, in response to which the tribunal\r\npublished heavier censures and fines, demanding the release of the\r\nprisoners. Then Bishop Murga intervened and asked the tribunal to accept\r\nan honorable compromise, but it refused; he returned to the charge,\r\nurging the affliction of the people, who dreaded an interdict at a time\r\nwhen there was so much need of rain and when Holy Week was approaching;\r\nif reference were made to the Suprema there would be a delay of six\r\nmonths and meanwhile the prisoners under trial by the Audiencia would\r\nlanguish in gaol, for the judges would be incapacitated by the\r\nexcommunication. The inquisitors, in their report to the Suprema,\r\nexplained that, seeing that the people were ready for a disastrous\r\noutbreak, and as the bishop promised that the prisoners should be\r\nreleased at once (as they were, after a confinement of five hours) they\r\nordered the excommunicates to be absolved and abstained from proceeding\r\nagainst the guilty. Then, when peace seemed restored, the quarrel broke\r\nout fiercely again, for the inquisitors demanded the surrender of the\r\nwarrant of arrest, which Bartolomé Ponce, the official charged with it,\r\nrefused to give up. He was arrested and as, after two days, he appealed\r\nto the Audiencia, they manacled him and ordered the arrest of the\r\nadvocate and procurator who had drawn up the appeal. This secured the\r\nsurrender of the document and the inquisitors felicitated themselves to\r\nthe Suprema on the vigor with which they had impressed on every one the\r\npower of the Inquisition. Whether the innocent cause of the disturbance,\r\nthe fisherman Bartolomé Alonso, received his lashes, seems to have been\r\nan incident too unimportant to be recorded.[359]\r\n\r\nRodrigo Gutiérrez de la Rosa, who was bishop from 1652 to 1658, was a\r\nman of violent temper, not as easily subdued as Bishop Vera, and his\r\nepiscopate was a prolonged quarrel with his chapter and with the\r\ntribunal. In 1654, Doctor Guirola, the commissioner at Santa Cruz de\r\nTenerife, was denounced, for his oppression, to the bishop, who ordered\r\nan investigation and his arrest if cause were found. This proved to be\r\nthe case and the arrest was made, against which the tribunal protested\r\nin terms so irritating that Gutiérrez excommunicated all its officials,\r\nringing the bells and placing their names on the _tablillas_, besides\r\nimposing a fine of 2000 ducats on each of the inquisitors. They met this\r\nby calling on the civil and military authorities for forcible aid and\r\nsummoned all the bishop’s dependents to assist them. Miguel de Collado,\r\nthe secretary, went to the cathedral to serve these notices, on hearing\r\nwhich Gutiérrez hastened thither with his followers and, not finding\r\nCollado, proceeded to the house of Inquisitor José Badaran, which he\r\nsearched from bottom to top for pledges to secure the payment of the\r\nfine. Word was carried to the tribunal, when the inquisitors, with a\r\nguard of soldiers, went to Badaran’s house, which they found barred\r\nagainst them, broke open the door and a stormy interview ensued. The\r\nbishop in the cathedral, published Badaran and the fiscal as\r\nexcommunicates; the inquisitors ordered the notices of excommunication\r\nremoved and fined the bishop in 4000 ducats. To collect this, they\r\nembargoed his revenues in Tenerife and he in turn embargoed the fruits\r\nof their prebends. They obtained guards of soldiers posted in their\r\nhouses and in that of the fiscal, fearing attack from the satellites of\r\nthe bishop, such as he had made in 1552 in the cathedral and in 1554 at\r\nthe house of the dean. In reporting all this to the Suprema, they\r\npromise to send the fiscal with all the documents by the next vessel,\r\nfor the authority and power of the Inquisition depend upon the\r\nresult.[360]\r\n\r\nWhile this was pending a quarrel arose between the tribunal and the\r\nchapter, because the latter refused to pay to the fiscal the fruits of\r\nhis prebend. Inquisitor-general Arce y Reynoso ordered the chapter to\r\nmake the payment, which led the canon Matheo de Cassares and the\r\nracionero Cristóbal Vandama to commit certain acts of disrespect. To\r\npunish this the inquisitors, on November 16, 1655, arrested them, in\r\nconformity with the rules prescribed by the Suprema, in its letter of\r\nSeptember 6, 1644, respecting the arrest of prebendaries, but, at the\r\nprayer of the chapter, they were released on the third day. They were\r\nfriends of Bishop Gutiérrez, who nursed his wrath until December 26th,\r\nwhen there was a solemn celebration in the cathedral, at which\r\nInquisitor Frias celebrated mass. When Inquisitor Badaran entered and\r\ntook his seat in the choir, Gutiérrez in a loud voice commanded him to\r\nleave the church, as he was under excommunication for arresting clerics\r\nwithout jurisdiction. To avoid creating a tumult he did so; Frias\r\ncelebrated mass and then joined him in the tribunal, where they drew up\r\nthe necessary papers. The affair of course created an immense scandal\r\nand led to prolonged correspondence with the Suprema, which ordered it\r\nsuspended April 12, 1657.[361] They were not much more successful in the\r\noutcome of the previous quarrel, although they succeeded, at the end of\r\n1656, in procuring a royal order summoning Gutiérrez to the court. In\r\ncommunicating this to the bishop, December 13, 1656, the Licenciate Blas\r\nCanales advises him, if he has any money to spare, to invest it in a\r\njewel for presentation to the king, through the hands of the minister\r\nLouis de Haro. He probably followed the judicious counsel, for the\r\nmatter ended with a decree relieving him from the fine imposed on him by\r\nthe inquisitors.[362]\r\n\r\nThe next encounter was with the Audiencia, in 1661. For eight years\r\nthere had been no physician in the island, when the tribunal, needing\r\none for the torture-chamber, induced, in 1659, Dr. Domingo Rodríguez\r\nRamos to come. He became a frequent visitor at the house of Doña Beatriz\r\nde Herrera, the _amiga_ of the judge Alvaro Gil de la Sierpe, to whom\r\nshe had borne several children. Sierpe became jealous and, on some\r\npretext, Dr. Ramos was arrested, January 28, 1661, and imprisoned in\r\nchains. The tribunal asserted its jurisdiction by inhibiting the\r\nAudiencia from prosecuting the case and, on this being disregarded, the\r\njudges were excommunicated with all the solemnities. They impassively\r\ncontinued their functions; the tribunal then excommunicated the\r\nofficials of the court, who were more easily frightened; for several\r\nmonths there was much popular excitement but, in October, the\r\ncompetencia was decided in favor of the Audiencia--doubtless because the\r\nphysician was not an official of the tribunal--and a royal letter\r\nsharply rebuked the inquisitors.[363]\r\n\r\nThe tribunal was evidently losing its prestige and matters did not\r\nimprove with the advent of the Bourbon dynasty. The enmity between it\r\nand the chapter continued undiminished and when, on the death of the\r\nMarquis of Celada, in 1707, his son, the Inquisitor Bartolomé Benítez de\r\nLugo, asked that his exequies should be performed in the cathedral, the\r\nrequest was refused. This led to a violent rupture, in the course of\r\nwhich the tribunal voted the arrest of the canons, with sequestration.\r\nThe chapter appealed to Philip V, who condemned the tribunal in a cédula\r\nof November 7, 1707. This did not arrive until the following year, when\r\nthe chapter kept it secret until Easter; in the crowded solemnity of the\r\nfeast-day, when Inquisitor Benítez was present, a secretary mounted the\r\npulpit and read the royal decree, to his great mortification.[364] Even\r\nworse befell the tribunal in 1714, when its inexcusable violence, in\r\nanother quarrel with the chapter, led Philip V to demand the recall of\r\nthe inquisitors and to enforce his commands in spite of the repeated\r\ntergiversations of the Suprema.[365]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs the eighteenth century advanced, the hostility of ecclesiastics and\r\nlaymen towards the tribunal continued unabated, while respect for it\r\nrapidly decreased and its functions dwindled, except in the matter of\r\ncensorship. A curious manifestation of the feeling entertained for it is\r\nto be found in the attitude of the parish priests with regard to the\r\nsanbenitos of the heretics hung in their churches. A report on the\r\nsubject called for by the Suprema, in 1788, elicited the statement that\r\nfor many years there had been no culprits of the class requiring\r\nsanbenitos. In 1756, when the walls of the parish church of Los Remedios\r\nde La Laguna were whitened, the incumbents resisted the replacement of\r\nthe sanbenitos, or at least wished to hang them where they should not be\r\nseen, but the tribunal ordered them to be renovated and hung\r\nconspicuously. In the Dominican church of Las Palmas, there used to be\r\nsanbenitos, but they had disappeared and the inquisitors could not\r\nexplain the cause of their removal. Eight years ago the parish church of\r\nTelde was whitened and the incumbents would not replace them; Inquisitor\r\nPadilla was informed of this, but he took no action. The only ones then\r\nto be seen in Las Palmas were in the cathedral; the building was\r\nundergoing alterations and the walls would be whitened, which the\r\ninquisitors expected would be alleged as a reason for removing\r\nthem.[366] Equally suggestive of the feeling of the laity is the fact\r\nthat, when the position of alguazil mayor fell vacant, it was offered in\r\nvain to representatives of the principal families, who all declined\r\nunder various pretexts.[367]\r\n\r\nThe sentiment of the population was duly represented by the eloquent\r\npriest Ruiz de Padron in the debates of the Córtes of Cádiz, in 1813,\r\nand the suppression of the Inquisition was greeted by the ecclesiastics\r\nof the Canaries in a temper very different from that manifested in the\r\nPeninsula. The bishop, Manuel Verdugo, a native of Las Palmas, was an\r\nenlightened man, who had had frequent differences with the tribunal. The\r\ndecree of suppression was received by him March 31st; it was his duty to\r\ntake charge of the archives and to close the building, and he lost no\r\ntime in communicating it to the inquisitors, José Francisco Borbujo y\r\nRiba and Antonio Fernando de Echanove. The chapter was overjoyed and, at\r\na session on April 3d, it addressed the Córtes, characterizing the\r\ndecree as manifestly the work of God and as removing from the Church of\r\nChrist a blemish which rendered religion odious. The same afternoon the\r\nsanbenitos in the cathedral were solemnly burnt in the patio. The bishop\r\nalso reported to the Córtes that their manifesto, which had excited the\r\ncanons of Cádiz to such extremity of opposition, had been duly read that\r\nmorning, and that he had been greatly pleased to see that the acts of\r\nthe Córtes had been received throughout his diocese with universal\r\nsatisfaction. He lost no time in taking possession of the archives, but\r\nthe inquisitors had already taken the precaution to remove, from the\r\nvolume of their correspondence with the Suprema, two leaves in which\r\nthey had spoken ill of him. The financial officials at the same time\r\nassumed charge of the landed property and censos, or ground-rents, of\r\nthe tribunal, which we are told were large and numerous. Inquisitor\r\nBorbujo remained at his post, awaiting the reaction. The poets of the\r\nisland were prompt in expressing the exuberance of their joy in verses,\r\nfor which action was subsequently taken against the priest, Mariano\r\nRomero, Don Rafael Bento and Don Francisco Guerra y Bethencourt.[368]\r\n\r\nWhen the Restoration swiftly followed, Inquisitor Borbujo received, on\r\nAugust 17, 1814, the decree re-establishing the Inquisition and called\r\non the bishop to surrender the building, but the latter declared that he\r\nmust await orders from competent authority. On September 29th there\r\ncame an order for the re-installation of the tribunal and Borbujo made\r\nanother effort to gain possession of the building and property, but it\r\nwas not until a royal mandate of November 28th was received that he\r\nsucceeded in doing so. The tribunal was thus fairly put on its feet\r\nagain, but such was the abhorrence in which it was held that its edicts\r\nwere torn down, its jurisdiction was everywhere contested, and its\r\noffices of alguazil and familiars could not be filled.[369]\r\n\r\nThus resuscitated, it diligently collected the pamphlets and periodicals\r\nand verses of the revolutionary period, and molested their authors as\r\nfar as it could. In fact, under the Restoration, except the occasional\r\nprosecution of a wise-woman, its functions, as in Spain, were mainly\r\npolitical, liberalism being equivalent to heresy and, except when it had\r\nsome political end in view, its efforts were ridiculed by both the civil\r\nand military authorities, which regarded it with no respect and\r\nencroached upon it from all sides. When the Revolution of 1820 broke\r\nout, news of Fernando VII’s oath to the Constitution and decree of March\r\n9th suppressing the Holy Office reached Santa Cruz de Tenerife April\r\n29th and Las Palmas some days later. Amid popular rejoicings, the\r\nInquisition closed its doors, delivered up its archives and the\r\ninquisitors sailed for Spain. No care was taken of the archives, which\r\nwere pillaged by curiosity hunters and those whose interests led them to\r\nacquire documents concerning limpieza or old law-suits. What remained\r\nwere stored in a damp, unventilated place; when removed, they were\r\ncarried off by cartloads, without keeping them in any order and, in\r\n1874, Millares describes them as forming a pile of chaotic, mutilated\r\nand illegible papers in a room of the City Hall.[370]\r\n\r\nThe reader may reasonably ask what, in its labor of three centuries, the\r\ntribunal of the Canaries accomplished to justify its existence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nMEXICO.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ostensible object of the Spanish conquests in the New World was the\r\npropagation of the faith. This was the sole motive alleged by Alexander\r\nVI, in the celebrated bull of 1493, conferring on the Spanish sovereigns\r\ndomination over the territories discovered by Columbus; it was asserted\r\nin the codicil to Queen Isabella’s will, urging her husband and children\r\nto keep it ever in view, and it was put forward in all the commissions\r\nand instructions issued to the adventurers who converted the shores of\r\nthe Caribbean into scenes of oppression and carnage.[371] If Philip II\r\nwas solicitous to preserve the purity of the faith in his own dominions,\r\nhe was no less anxious to spread it beyond the seas; he prescribed this\r\nas one of the chief duties of his officers, describing it as the\r\nprincipal object of Spanish rule, to which all questions of profit and\r\nadvantage were to be regarded as subordinate.[372]\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted, however, that the effort to spread the gospel\r\nlagged behind those directed to the acquisition of the precious metals.\r\nIt is true that, on the second voyage of Columbus, in 1493, the\r\nsovereigns sent Fray Buil, with a dozen clerics and full papal\r\nfaculties, but he busied himself more in quarrelling with the admiral\r\nthan in converting the heathen.[373] The first regular missionaries of\r\nwhom we have knowledge were two Franciscans who, in 1500, accompanied\r\nBobadilla to the West Indies and, in a letter of October 12th of that\r\nyear, reported to the Observantine Vicar-general, Olivier Maillard, that\r\nthey found the natives eager for conversion and that they had baptized\r\nthree thousand in the first port which they reached in Hispañola.[374]\r\nThey were followed, in 1502, by a few more Franciscans under Fray Alonso\r\ndel Espinal, a worthy man, according to Las Casas, but who could think\r\nof nothing but the _Summa Angelica_ of his brother Franciscan, Angelo da\r\nChivasso.[375] The first earnest effort to instruct the natives was made\r\nby Fray Pedro de Córdova, who came in 1510 with two Dominicans and was\r\nsoon followed by ten or twelve more; during the succeeding years he and\r\nthe Franciscans founded some missionary stations on the coast of Tierra\r\nFirme, but they were broken up by the Indians in 1523.[376] As, however,\r\nwe are told that none of the missionaries took the trouble to learn the\r\nIndian languages, their evangelizing success may be doubted.[377]\r\n\r\nThe efforts to organize a church establishment proceeded but slowly at\r\nfirst. Hispañola was divided into two bishoprics, San Domingo and la\r\nVega. For the former, at a date not definitely stated, the Franciscan,\r\nGarcía de Padilla, was appointed, but he died before setting out to take\r\npossession. For the latter, Pero Suárez Deza, nephew of\r\nInquisitor-general Deza, was chosen and we are told that he governed his\r\nsee for some years[378] but, as he figures in the Lucero troubles of\r\nCórdova, in 1506, as the “archbishop-elect of the Indies” the period of\r\nhis episcopate is not easily definable. However this may be, the first\r\nbishop who appears in the episcopal lists of Hispañola is Alessandro\r\nGeraldino, with the date of 1520.[379] Cortés, who had asked to have\r\nbishoprics organized in his new conquests, speedily changed his mind and\r\nrequested Charles V to send out only friars. The priests of the Indians,\r\nhe said, were so rigidly held to modesty and chastity that, if the\r\npeople were to witness the pomp and disorderly lives of the Spanish\r\nclergy, they would regard Christianity as a farce and their conversion\r\nwould be impracticable. Charles heeded the warning and, during the rest\r\nof his reign, he appointed as bishops only members of the religious\r\nOrders, while the secular clergy were but sparingly allowed to emigrate\r\nand those who succeeded in going earned as a body a most unenviable\r\nreputation.[380] The Church thus started grew rapidly and, towards the\r\nclose of the century, Padre Mendieta informs us that New Spain\r\n(comprising Mexico and Central America) had ten bishoprics, besides the\r\nmetropolitan see of the capital, four hundred convents and as many\r\nclerical districts, and that each of these eight hundred had numerous\r\nchurches in its charge.[381]\r\n\r\nIt seems strange that the Spanish monarchs, combining earnest desire for\r\nthe propagation of the faith with intense zeal for its purity, should\r\nhave so long postponed the extension of the Holy Office over their new\r\ndominions, while thus active in building up the Church. The Indian\r\nneophytes, it is true, were not in need of its ministrations, but the\r\ncolonists might well be a subject of concern. Manasseh ben Israel\r\n(_circa_ 1644) tells us that, after the expulsion in 1492, many Jews and\r\nJudaizing New Christians sought an asylum in the New World and that\r\nAntonio Montesinos, a Spanish Jew who had long lived there, reported\r\nthat he found the Jewish rites carefully preserved, especially in\r\ncertain valleys of South America.[382] It is true that there were\r\nrepeated efforts to prohibit New Christians and those who had been\r\npenanced by the Inquisition, with their descendants, from emigrating to\r\nthe Indies, but this was a provision difficult to enforce, and relief\r\nfrom it was a financial expedient tempting to the chronically empty\r\ntreasury of Spain. In the great composition of Seville, in 1509, there\r\nwas a provision that, for twenty thousand ducats, the disability should\r\nbe in so far removed that such persons could go to the colonies and\r\ntrade there for two years, on each voyage. After Ferdinand’s death, this\r\nwas confirmed by Charles V, but he soon afterwards, September 24, 1518,\r\nordered the Casa de Contratacion of Seville not to permit them to\r\nembark. They complained loudly of this violation of faith and, on\r\nJanuary 23, 1519, he ordered the Inquisition of Seville to examine the\r\nagreement and, if it was found to contain such a clause, the prohibition\r\nshould be withdrawn. Six months later, on July 16th, it was renewed,\r\nexciting fresh remonstrances that they were compelled to pay the money\r\nwhile the privilege was denied. The matter was then referred to the\r\nSuprema, which decided that the complaints were justified, whereupon\r\nCharles, on December 13th, ordered the inquisitors of Seville to permit\r\nthem to go, provided the whole amount of the composition, eighty\r\nthousand ducats, had been fully paid.[383] Thus, in one way or another,\r\nthe enterprising New Christians sought successfully to share in the\r\nlucrative exploitation of the colonies, and it illustrates the\r\nineffectiveness of Spanish administration that, in 1537, it felt obliged\r\nto call in papal assistance to supplement its deficiencies. Accordingly\r\nPaul III, in his bull _Altitudo divini consilii_, forbade all apostates\r\nfrom going to the Indies and commanded the colonial bishops to expel any\r\nwho might come.[384] Prince Philip followed this by a decree of August\r\n14, 1543, ordering all viceroys, governors and courts to investigate\r\nwhat Moorish slaves or freemen, recently converted, or sons of Jews\r\nresided in the Indies and to banish all whom they might discover,\r\nsending them to Spain in the first ships, for in no case were they to be\r\nallowed to remain.[385]\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the persevering New Christians evaded these\r\nregulations and that their success in this was a subject of solicitude,\r\nyet there was long delay in providing effectual means to preserve the\r\nfaith from their contamination. It is true that, when bishoprics were\r\nerected, the jurisdiction over heresy, inherent in the episcopal office,\r\nmight have been exercised on them, had not the Inquisition arrogated to\r\nitself the exclusive cognizance over all matters of faith and regarded\r\nwith extreme jealousy all episcopal invasions of its province. This is\r\nillustrated by a case in 1515 which shows how indisposed it was even to\r\ndelegate its power. Pedro de Leon, with his wife and daughter, had\r\nsought refuge in Hispañola, where the episcopal provisor arrested them\r\nand obtained confessions inculpating them and others. In place of\r\nauthorizing him to complete the trial and punish them, the Suprema\r\nnotified him that the inquisitor-general was sending a special messenger\r\nto bring them back to Seville, together with any other fugitives whom\r\nthe provisor may have arrested, and he is commanded to deliver them\r\nwithout delay or prevarication, under penalty of forfeiture of\r\ntemporalities and citizenship; moreover, the Admiral Diego Colon is\r\ncommanded to render aid and favor and the Contratacion of Seville is\r\nrequired to furnish the messenger with a good ship to take him to the\r\nIndies and to see that on his return he has a vessel with a captain\r\nbeyond suspicion and a place where the prisoners can be confined and\r\nkept secluded from all communication.[386]\r\n\r\nThis was evidently a very cumbrous and costly method of dealing with\r\nheretics, but it does not appear that the Holy Office consented to\r\ndelegate its powers until 1519, when Charles V, by a cédula of May 20th,\r\nconfirmed the appointment by Cardinal Adrian the inquisitor-general, of\r\nAlfonso Manso, Bishop of Puertorico and the Dominican Pedro de Córdova,\r\nas inquisitors of the Indies, and ordered all officials to render them\r\nobedience and assistance.[387] On the death of Pedro, the appointing\r\npower is said to have vested in the Audiencia of San Domingo which, in\r\n1524, appointed Martin de Valencia as commissioner. He was a Franciscan\r\nof high repute for holiness who in that year reached Mexico at the head\r\nof a dozen of his brethren and was received by the Conquistadores on\r\ntheir knees. We are told that he burnt a heretic and reconciled two\r\nothers, which if true would show that he was clothed with the full\r\npowers of an inquisitor. He soon afterwards returned to Spain and we\r\nhear of Fray Tomás Ortiz, Fray Domingo de Betanzos and Fray Vicente de\r\nSanta María as succeeding him in 1526 and 1528, but the references to\r\nthese shadowy personalities are conflicting and there are no records of\r\ntheir activity.[388]\r\n\r\nWith the appointment of bishops in New Spain, in 1527, and the gradual\r\nsystematic organization of the hierarchy, it would seem that special\r\ninquisitoral powers were delegated to them, of the results of which we\r\nhave traces in the _sanbenitos_ or _tablillas_ of those burnt or\r\nreconciled which were hung in the cathedrals. Early in the nineteenth\r\ncentury Padre José Pichardo made a list of those remaining in the\r\ncathedral of Mexico, which has recently been printed and from this we\r\nlearn that an auto de fe was celebrated in 1536, at which Andreas Morvan\r\nwas reconciled for Lutheranism, and another in 1539, when Francisco\r\nMillan was reconciled for Judaism and a cacique of Tezcoco was burnt for\r\noffering human sacrifices.[389] This latter stretch of authority by\r\nArchbishop Zumárraga was contrary to the policy of the government and,\r\nin 1543, Inquisitor-general Tavera superseded him by sending Francisco\r\nTello de Sandoval, inquisitor of Toledo, to Mexico to perform the same\r\noffice. His commission, dated July 18th of that year, empowers him to\r\ntake up and prosecute to the end all cases commenced by previous\r\ninquisitors, and a letter of Prince Philip, July 24th, to the royal\r\nofficials of New Spain, commands them to give him all requisite\r\nassistance.[390] It does not appear, however, that he was furnished with\r\nofficials to organize a tribunal and, as his principal charge was that\r\nof a _visitador_ or inspector of the ecclesiastical establishment, it is\r\nnot probable that he accomplished much as inquisitor. The list of\r\nsanbenitos shows no more autos de fe until 1555, by which time the work\r\nhad fallen back into the hands of Archbishop Montúfar, for the home\r\nGovernment was evidently unwilling to assume the heavy cost of a fully\r\norganized tribunal, and the bishops were ready to perform its duties.\r\nWhen, in 1545, Las Casas, as Bishop of Chiapa, asked the royal Audiencia\r\nof Gracia á Dios to sustain him in his episcopal jurisdiction against\r\nhis recalcitrant flock, he makes special reference to cases of the\r\nInquisition as included in it and, soon after this, in Peru, Juan\r\nMatienzo says that the bishops exercised inquisitorial jurisdiction and\r\nthat, when any attempt was made to appeal from them, they would elude it\r\nby claiming that they were acting as inquisitors.[391] That this was\r\nrecognized at home is manifested by Prince Philip, in 1553, extending to\r\nthe Indies the Concordia of Castile regulating the _fuero_ of familiars,\r\nas though there was a regularly organized Inquisition throughout the\r\ncolonies.[392]\r\n\r\nIn the auto of 1555, Gerónimo Venzon, an Italian, was reconciled for\r\nLutheranism and it was followed by one in 1558, when María de Ocampo was\r\nreconciled for pact with the demon.[393] There was also an Englishman\r\nnamed Robert Thompson, condemned for Lutheranism to wear the sanbenito\r\nfor three years, and a Genoese, Agostino Boacio, for the same crime, to\r\nperpetual prison and sanbenito. These two latter were shipped to Seville\r\nto perform their penance, but Boacio managed to escape at the Azores. In\r\n1560 there were seven Lutherans reconciled, concerning whom we have no\r\ndetails; in 1561 a French Calvinist and a Greek schismatist and in 1562\r\ntwo French Calvinists.[394] This shows that the episcopal Inquisition\r\nwas by no means inert, and a sentence rendered by the Ordinary of\r\nMexico, in 1568, indicates that its severity might cause the\r\ninstallation of the regular Holy Office to be regarded rather as a\r\nrelief. A Flemish painter, Simon Pereyns, who had drifted to Mexico, in\r\na talk with a brother artist, Francisco Morales, chanced to utter the\r\ncommon remark that simple fornication was not a sin and persisted in it\r\nafter remonstrance. That the episcopal Inquisition was thoroughly\r\nestablished is indicated by his considering it prudent to denounce\r\nhimself to the Officiality, which he did on September 10, 1568. In Spain\r\nthis particular heresy, especially in _espontaneados_, was not severely\r\ntreated, but the provisor, Esteban de Portillo, took it seriously and\r\nthrew him in prison. During the trial Morales testified that Pereyns had\r\nsaid that he preferred to paint portraits rather than images, which he\r\nexplained was because they paid better. This did not satisfy the\r\nprovisor who proceeded to torture him when he endured, without further\r\nconfession, three turns of the _cordeles_ and three jars of water\r\ntrickled down his throat on a linen cloth. This ought to have earned his\r\ndismissal but, on December 4th, he was condemned to pay the costs of his\r\ntrial and to give security that he would not leave the city until he\r\nshould have painted a picture of Our Lady of Merced, as an altar-piece\r\nfor the church. He complied and it was duly hung in the cathedral.[395]\r\nA still more forcible example of the abuse of episcopal inquisitorial\r\nauthority was the case of Don Pedro Juárez de Toledo, alcalde mayor of\r\nTrinidad in Guatemala, arrested with sequestration of property by his\r\nbishop, Bernardino de Villalpando, on a charge of heresy. He died in\r\nSeptember, 1569, with his trial unfinished; it was transferred to the\r\nInquisition on its establishment and, in the auto de fe of February 28,\r\n1574, a sentence was rendered clearing his memory of all infamy, which\r\nwe are told gave much satisfaction for he was a man much honored and the\r\nvindictiveness of the prosecution was notorious.[396]\r\n\r\nThese inquisitorial powers, however, were only enjoyed temporarily by\r\nthe bishops and when, in 1570, a tribunal was finally established in\r\nMexico, a circular was addressed to them formally warning them against\r\nallowing their provisors or officials to exercise jurisdiction in\r\nmatters of faith and ordering them to transmit to the inquisitors any\r\nevidence which they might have or might obtain in cases of heresy. The\r\nbishops apparently were unwilling to surrender the jurisdiction to which\r\nthey had grown accustomed, for the command had to be repeated, May 26,\r\n1585.[397]\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark that there seems to have been no pressure from\r\nRome to extend the Inquisition over the New World. St. Pius V,\r\nnotwithstanding his fierce inquisitorial activity in Italy, could give\r\nPhilip II the sanest and most temperate advice about the colonies. On\r\nlearning that the king proposed to send thither officials selected with\r\nthe utmost care, he wrote, August 18, 1568, to Inquisitor-general\r\nEspinosa to encourage him in the good work. The surest way, he says, to\r\npropagate the faith is to remove all unnecessary burdens and to so treat\r\nthe people that they may rejoice more and more to throw off the bonds of\r\nidolatry and submit themselves to the sweet yoke of Christ; the\r\nChristians who go thither should be such as to edify the people by their\r\nlives and morals, so as to confirm the converts and to allure the\r\nheathen to conversion.[398] To do Philip justice, he earnestly strove\r\nto follow in the path thus wisely indicated, but Spanish\r\nmaladministration was too firmly rooted for him to succeed. If he could\r\nnot thus render the faith attractive he could at least preserve its\r\npurity; the colonists were becoming too numerous for their aberrations\r\nto be left to episcopal provisors, overburdened with a multiplicity of\r\nother duties, and the only safety lay in extending to the colonies the\r\nInquisition whose tribunals would have no other function.\r\n\r\nThe incentive to this, however, was not so much the danger anticipated\r\nfrom Judaizing New Christians as from the propaganda of the Reformers,\r\nwho were regarded as zealously engaged in sending to the New World their\r\nheretical books and versions of Scripture and even as venturing there\r\npersonally in hopes of combining missionary work with the profits of\r\ntrade. This is the motive alleged by Philip II, in his cédulas of\r\nJanuary 25, 1569, and August 16, 1570, confirming the action of\r\nInquisitor-general Espinosa in founding the Mexican tribunal.[399]\r\nLeonardo Donato, the Venetian envoy, in his report of 1573, assents to\r\nthis as the cause, not only of the establishment of the Mexican\r\nInquisition but also of the prohibition of intercourse with the colonies\r\nto Germans and Flemings, although the latter were Spanish subjects.[400]\r\nThe Protestant missionary spirit in fact was, at this time, by no means\r\nas ardent as the Inquisition sought to make the faithful believe, yet it\r\ncould reasonably point in justification to the number of Protestants who\r\nfurnished the material for the earlier inquisitorial activity.\r\n\r\nAlthough the decision to establish colonial tribunals was reached and\r\nmade known in the cédula of January, 1569, Philip proceeded with his\r\nusual dilatory caution. It was not until January 3, 1570, that Espinosa\r\nnotified Doctor Moya de Contreras, then Inquisitor of Murcia, that he\r\nhad been selected as senior inquisitor of the projected tribunal; he\r\nwas to enjoy a salary of three thousand pesos and the fruits of a\r\nprebend in the cathedral; he was to have a colleague, a fiscal and a\r\nnotary or secretary, while such other officials as might be necessary\r\nwould be appointed on the spot, in accordance with instructions to be\r\ngiven to him.[401] Contreras declined the appointment on the ground of\r\nhis health, which would not endure the voyage, and his poverty, for he\r\nwas endeavoring to place his sister in a convent. Espinosa insisted,\r\npointing out that the position would be but temporary and would lead to\r\npromotion, which was verified for, in 1573, Contreras became Archbishop\r\nof Mexico, served for a time as viceroy, and, on his return to Spain,\r\nwas made president of the Council of Indies.[402] The junior inquisitor\r\nwas the Licenciado Pascual de Cervantes, canon of Canaries, who was\r\ninstructed to learn the duties of his office from his experienced\r\nsenior. Their commissions bore date August 18, 1570, and empowered them\r\nto evoke and continue all cases that might be in the hands of\r\ninquisitors or episcopal officials. It was not until November 13th that\r\nthey set sail from San Lucar for the Canaries, where they hoped to take\r\npassage on the fleet. In this they were disappointed, as it did not call\r\nat the islands, and they were detained in Tenerife until June 2, 1571.\r\nCervantes died on the voyage July 26th and Contreras was wrecked on the\r\ncoast of Cuba, August 11th, but he found refuge on another vessel and\r\nreached San Juan de Ulua August 18th. He entered the city of Mexico\r\nSeptember 12th, but the ceremonies of reception and installation were\r\ndelayed until November 4th.[403] These were of the most impressive\r\ncharacter. A proclamation, two days before, to sound of drum and\r\ntrumpet, had summoned to be present in the cathedral, under pain of\r\nmajor excommunication, the whole population over twelve years of age.\r\nFrom the building assigned to the tribunal, the viceroy and senior judge\r\nof the royal court, followed by all the officials, conducted the\r\ninquisitor to the church, where, after the sermon and before the\r\nelevation of the host, the secretary of the Inquisition read the royal\r\nletters addressed to the viceroy and all other officials, reciting at\r\ngreat length the dangers of the heretic propaganda and commanding every\r\none to render all aid and service to the inquisitors and their\r\nofficials, arresting all whom they should designate and punishing with\r\nthe legal penalties those whom they should relax as heretics or\r\nrelapsed. Moreover the king took under his protection all those\r\nconnected with the Holy Office and warned his subjects that any injury\r\ninflicted on them would be visited with the punishment due to violation\r\nof the royal safeguard. Then an edict was read, embodying the oath of\r\nobedience and pledging every one, under fearful maledictions, spiritual\r\nand temporal, to aid the Inquisition in every way and to denounce and\r\npersecute heretics as wolves and mad dogs. On this the viceroy arose\r\nand, placing his hand on the gospels which lay on a table, took the oath\r\nand all the officials present advanced in procession and followed his\r\nexample.\r\n\r\nThe Inquisition thus was fairly established in the city of Mexico; it\r\nissued its Edict of Faith and, on November 10th, it published letters\r\naddressed to all the inhabitants of its enormous district, stretching\r\nfrom the Atlantic to the Pacific and from Darien to the unknown regions\r\nto the North, commanding them and their officials to take the same\r\nportentous oath of obedience. In an age of faith, it is easy to see how\r\nprofound was the impression made when the population of every parish and\r\nmission was assembled in its church and listened to such utterances in\r\nthe name of Christ and the pope, with their reduplication of threats and\r\npromises, and each one was required to raise his right hand and solemnly\r\nswear on the cross and the gospels to accept it all and obey it to the\r\nletter.[404]\r\n\r\nAs communication between the tribunal and the Supreme Council in Madrid\r\nwas slow and irregular, there was necessity that it should have greater\r\nindependent authority than that allowed to the provincial Inquisitions\r\nin Spain, which at this period were constantly becoming more and more\r\nsubject to the central head. Accordingly it was furnished not only with\r\nthe general Instructions current everywhere but with special elaborate\r\nones, providing among other matters that in the _consulta de fe_, or\r\nmeeting to decide upon a sentence, if there should be _discordia_ or\r\nlack of unanimity among the inquisitors and the episcopal Ordinary (who\r\nalways took part in such matters) the case was not referred to the\r\nSuprema, as in Spain, unless the question was as to relaxation to the\r\nsecular arm; if this was involved, the accused was to be sent to the\r\nSuprema, which decided his fate. If the sentence was to torture or\r\nreconciliation, or a milder penance, then the opinion prevailed of the\r\ntwo inquisitors, or of the Ordinary and one of the inquisitors, while if\r\nall three were discordant, then the consultors decided as to which of\r\nthe three opinions should be adopted. Appeals to the Suprema against\r\nsentences of torture, or of extraordinary punishments, were similarly\r\nreplaced by giving the prisoner another hearing, allowing the fiscal to\r\nargue against him and reconsidering the sentence in the consulta de\r\nfe.[405] These instructions also prescribed the enforcement of the Index\r\nof prohibited books, both as to the suppression of those existing in the\r\ncolony and the watchful supervision of imports, all of which Doctor\r\nContreras hastened to execute by requiring every owner of books to\r\npresent a sworn list of those in his possession. It would not be easy,\r\nhowever, to define whence he derived his authority for his next step,\r\nwhich was to forbid the departure from the land of any one without a\r\nspecial licence from the Inquisition--a stretch of power which we are\r\ntold met with the hearty concurrence of the viceroy, Martin Enríquez,\r\nwho had not otherwise manifested much prepossession in favor of the new\r\njurisdiction thus established in his territories.[406]\r\n\r\nThe inquisitor evidently magnified his office and the result soon showed\r\nhow much more efficient was a tribunal of which the energies were\r\nconcentrated on a single object, than the desultory action of the\r\nepiscopal provisors. He had, on his arrival, lost no time in filling up\r\nhis staff by appointing an alguazil mayor, an alcaide of the secret\r\nprisons, a _portero_ or apparitor and a messenger, as well as a receiver\r\nof confiscations, to whom he assigned the handsome salary of six hundred\r\nducats, not anticipating how slender, for some time, were to be the\r\nreceipts from that source. His efforts were seconded at home for, by a\r\n_carta orden_ of the Suprema, January 5, 1573, the Spanish tribunals\r\nwere instructed to give precedence over all other business to requests\r\nfrom colonial Inquisitions for evidence to be taken and furnished,\r\nexperience having already shown the great benefit arising from their\r\nestablishment there.[407] The publication of the Edict of Faith had\r\nbrought in many denunciations; arrests were frequent and the number of\r\nprisoners soon exceeded the capacity of the improvised prison--among\r\nthem some thirty-six Englishmen, the remnant of the hundred of Sir John\r\nHawkins’s men who had taken their chances on shore after the disaster at\r\nSan Juan de Ulua, in 1568.[408] The fruits of this energy were seen when\r\nthe first great auto de fe was celebrated February 28, 1574, with a\r\nsolemnity declared by eyewitnesses to be equal in everything, save the\r\npresence of royalty, to that of Valladolid, May 21, 1559, when the\r\nSpanish Lutherans suffered. A fortnight in advance it was announced\r\nthroughout the city with drums and trumpets, the Inquisition commenced\r\nto erect its staging and the city authorities did the like for\r\nthemselves and their wives, and invited the judges and their wives to\r\nseats on it. A week later, on learning that prominent officials from all\r\nparts of the country were coming, the invitation was extended to them.\r\nThe population poured in from all quarters, crowding the streets and\r\noccupying every spot from which the spectacle could be witnessed. The\r\nnight before was occupied in drilling, in the courtyard of the\r\nInquisition, the unfortunates who were to appear and at daylight they\r\nwere breakfasted on wine and slices of bread fried in honey.\r\n\r\nThe accounts of the auto as given by Señor Medina are somewhat confused,\r\nbut from them we gather that there were seventy-four sufferers in all.\r\nOf these, three were for asserting that simple fornication between the\r\nunmarried was no sin; twenty-seven were for bigamy; two for blasphemy;\r\none for wearing prohibited articles although his grandfather had been\r\nburnt; two for “propositions;” one because he had made his wife confess\r\nto him and thirty-six for Lutheranism, of whom two, George Ripley and\r\nMarin Cornu were burnt. These Lutherans were all foreigners of various\r\nnationalities, but mostly English, consisting of Hawkins’s men. One of\r\nthese, named Miles Phillips has left an account of the affair, in which\r\nhe says that his compatriots George Ripley, Peter Momfrie and Cornelius\r\nthe Irishman were burnt, sixty or sixty-one were scourged and sent to\r\nthe galleys and seven, of whom he was one, were condemned to serve in\r\nconvents; the wholesale scourging was performed the next day, through\r\nthe accustomed streets, the culprits being preceded by a crier calling\r\nout “See these English Lutheran dogs, enemies of God!” while inquisitors\r\nand familiars shouted to the executioners “Harder, harder, on these\r\nEnglish Lutherans!” Páramo, who doubtless had access to official\r\nrecords, tells us that there were about eighty penitents in all, of whom\r\nan Englishman and a Frenchman were burnt, some Judaizers were\r\nreconciled, together with several bigamists and practitioners of\r\nsorcery. One of these latter, he says, was a woman who had made her\r\nhusband come in two days to Mexico from Guatemala, two hundred leagues\r\naway and, when asked by the inquisitor why she had done this, she\r\nreplied that it was in order to enjoy the sight of his beauty, the fact\r\nbeing that he was the foulest of men. Bigamy, he adds, was a very\r\nfrequent crime, for men thought that, at so great a distance from Spain,\r\nthere was little chance of detection.[409]\r\n\r\nMiles Phillips says that at the conclusion of the auto the victims\r\nrelaxed were burnt on the plaza, near the staging. This shows that no\r\nproper preparation had been made for these solemnities and in fact, it\r\nwas not until 1596 that the municipality, at a cost of four hundred\r\npesos, constructed a _quemadero_ or burning place, where concremation\r\ncould be performed decently and in order. It was a ghastly adjunct to a\r\npleasure-ground, for it was situated at the east end of the Alameda.\r\nThere it remained until the stake was growing obsolete and was removed\r\nin 1771 to enlarge the promenade.[410]\r\n\r\nThis was the last inquisitorial act of Doctor Contreras, whose\r\npromotion to the archbishopric had already taken place. He had been\r\nprovided with a colleague by the promotion of the fiscal Bonilla in\r\n1572, and the vacancy caused by his retirement was filled by the\r\nappointment of Alonso Granero de Avalos. These held an auto March 6,\r\n1575, in which there were thirty-one culprits, twenty-five of them for\r\nbigamy and but one Protestant, the Irishman William Cornelius, who was\r\nburnt. Less important was an auto celebrated February 19, 1576, with\r\nthirteen culprits, all for minor offences, except an Englishman named\r\nThomas Farrar, a shoemaker long resident in Mexico, who was reconciled\r\nfor Protestantism. Another auto followed December 15, 1577, in which,\r\nbesides the customary minor offenders, three Englishmen, Paul Hawkins,\r\nJohn Stone and Robert Cook, were reconciled for Protestantism and the\r\nfirst Judaizer, Alvarez Pliego, abjured de vehementi and was fined in\r\n500 pesos.[411] The Judaism which thus commenced to show itself speedily\r\nfurnished further victims for, in 1578, two Spaniards were burnt for it\r\nand, in 1579, another, García González Bermejero, while a Frenchman,\r\nGuillaume Potier, who escaped, was burnt in effigy for Calvinism. After\r\nthis, until 1590, the tribunal seems to have become indolent; but few\r\nautos were celebrated and the culprits consisted of the miscellaneous\r\nbigamists, blasphemers, sorcerers and soliciting confessors, whose cases\r\npresent no especial interest. With 1590 the yearly autos were resumed.\r\nIn that year nine Judaizers at least were reconciled, one was burnt in\r\nperson and one in effigy. With the advent of Alonso de Peralta as\r\ninquisitor, in 1594, the tribunal seems to have been aroused to\r\nincreased activity and the auto of December 8, 1596, was a memorable one\r\nin which there were sixty-six penitents, including twenty-two Judaizers\r\nreconciled, nine burnt in person and ten in effigy. Even this was\r\nexceeded by the great auto of March 26, 1601, also celebrated by\r\nPeralta, in which there were one hundred and twenty four penitents, of\r\nwhom four were burnt in person and sixteen in effigy. There would seem\r\nto have been a recrudescence of Protestantism, for among these were\r\ntwenty-three Lutherans and Calvinists.[412]\r\n\r\nThe Inquisition thus vindicated the necessity of its existence if the\r\nland was to be purified of heresy and apostasy, for some of the\r\nJudaizers had been practising their unhallowed rites for an incredible\r\nlength of time. García González Bermejero, who was burnt in 1579, had\r\nbeen thus outraging the faith in Mexico for twenty years; Juan\r\nCastellanos, who repented and was reconciled in 1590, had done so for\r\nforty-eight years. Although their Judaism was almost public, for they\r\nate the paschal lamb and smeared their houses with blood, they were only\r\ndiscovered through the confession of an accomplice tried in Spain, who\r\ndenounced González. Of a family of Portuguese Jews who suffered in 1592,\r\nand the following years, we are told that the father, Francisco\r\nRodríguez Mattos, was a rabbi and a dogmatizer, or teacher. Fortunately\r\nfor him he was dead and was only burnt in effigy, as was likewise his\r\nson, who escaped by flight. His four daughters repented and were\r\nreconciled. They were in high social position and a cultured race, for\r\nit is said that the youngest, a girl of seventeen, could recite all the\r\npsalms of David and could repeat the prayer of Esther and other Hebrew\r\nsongs backwards. A brother of these girls, Luis de Carvajal, was\r\ngovernor of the province of New Leon and a man who had rendered\r\nessential service to the crown; for the crime of not denouncing them, he\r\nwas prosecuted, publicly penanced as a fautor of heresy and deprived of\r\nhis office; he relapsed, was tried and tortured in 1595 and was burnt in\r\nthe auto of December 8, 1596, together with his mother and three\r\nsisters.[413] The men who founded the Mexican Inquisition knew their\r\nduty and were resolute in its performance. They were kept busy for,\r\nbetween 1574 and 1600, they despatched no less than 879 cases, or an\r\naverage of about thirty-four per annum.[414] Considering the complex\r\ncharacter of inquisitorial procedure, with its inevitable delays and\r\nconsumption of time, this represents a creditable degree of industry,\r\nequal to that of the great tribunal of Toledo which, at the same period,\r\nwas averaging thirty-five cases per annum.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that no Indians figure among the victims on these\r\noccasions, since the zeal of Bishop Zumárraga, in 1536, burned the\r\ncacique of Tezcoco. In fact, the native population was exempt from the\r\njurisdiction of the Inquisition. This exemption was originally\r\nattributable to the theory held by the Conquistadores that the Indians\r\nwere too low in the scale of humanity to be capable of the faith--a\r\ntheory largely relied upon to excuse the cruelties inflicted upon them.\r\nIn 1517, when Las Casas was laboring in their behalf at the Spanish\r\ncourt, this proposition was advanced by a member of the royal council to\r\nFray Reginaldo Montesino, who was assisting Las Casas and who promptly\r\ndeclared it to be heretical. To settle the question, he asked one of the\r\nforemost theologians of the time, Fray Juan Hurtado, to assemble the\r\ndoctors of the University of Salamanca to decide the matter; thirteen of\r\nthem debated it and drew up a series of conclusions which they all\r\nsigned, the final one being that whoever defended with pertinacity such\r\na proposition must be put to death by fire as a heretic.[415]\r\nNotwithstanding this decision, the theory was so generally asserted in\r\nthe New World that Fray Julian Garcés, the first Bishop of Tlaxcala,\r\nwrote to Paul III on the subject and elicited a brief of June 2, 1537,\r\ncondemning those who, to gratify their greed, asserted that the Indians\r\nwere like brutes to be reduced to servitude, and declaring them\r\ncompetent to receive the faith and enjoy the sacraments.[416] Bishop\r\nZumárraga had already acted on this presumption when he burnt the\r\ncacique and this suggested an obstacle, almost as damaging as the\r\npopular theory, to the conversion which was the ostensible object of the\r\nconquest, for it was evident that the _doctrineros_, or missionaries,\r\nwould find their labors nugatory if the Indians realized that, in\r\nembracing the new faith, they would be liable to death by fire for\r\naberrations from it. To remove this impediment, Charles V, by a decree\r\nof October 15, 1538, ordered that they should not be subject to the\r\ninquisitorial process but that, in all matters of faith, they should be\r\nrelegated to the ordinary jurisdiction of their bishops. As the papal\r\ndelegation of power to the inquisitors gave them exclusive faculties in\r\nall cases of faith, this imperial rescript would have been invalid\r\nwithout papal sanction, but this had already been procured in the brief\r\n_Altitudo divini consilii_ of Paul III, June 1, 1537.[417]\r\n\r\nIt was probably through an oversight that the commissions issued to\r\nFrancisco Tello de Sandoval in 1543 and to Dr. Contreras in 1570 granted\r\nthem jurisdiction without exception over every one, of whatever\r\ncondition, quality or state; possibly the latter may have commenced to\r\nexercise it on the Indians, but the error was rectified by Philip II, in\r\na decree of December 30, 1571, ordering the inquisitors to observe their\r\ninstructions and the previous law, and the injunction had to be repeated\r\nin 1575. Moreover, to silence any objections as to the episcopal power,\r\nhe procured from Gregory XIII a brief granting full faculties to the\r\nbishops to absolve the Indians for heresy and all other reserved\r\ncases.[418] The Indians thus remained exempt from prosecution by the\r\nInquisition--an exemption popularly attributed to their not being _gente\r\nde razon_, or not rational enough to be responsible--which libel on\r\ntheir intellect Las Casas considers as perhaps the worst of the many\r\noffences committed upon them.[419] They could, however, endure this\r\nphilosophically so long as it exempted them from the Holy Office and\r\nconfided them to the more temperate zeal of the bishops.[420]\r\n\r\nWhile the Inquisition, as we have seen, maintained its awful dignity\r\nbefore the people, by the solemnity of its public functions and its\r\nseverity towards the evil-minded, all was not entirely serene within its\r\nwalls. In fact, its financial history illustrates so vividly some of the\r\naspects of Spanish colonial administration that it is worth recounting\r\nin some detail. We have seen that Inquisitor Contreras was promised a\r\nsalary of three thousand pesos and a prebend in the cathedral, but he\r\nwas confronted with a decree of January 25, 1569, prescribing that the\r\nincome of all benefices enjoyed by inquisitors and fiscals in the Indies\r\nwas to be deducted from their salaries, and the retention of this\r\nprovision in the Recopilacion shows that it was not of mere temporary\r\nvalidity.[421] It was doubtless however waived in favor of the\r\nInquisition, as was likewise another question which speedily arose.\r\n\r\nThe tribunal was expected to become self-supporting, from confiscations,\r\nfines and pecuniary penances, but this required time and meanwhile\r\nPhilip granted it a subvention from the royal treasury, to continue\r\nduring his pleasure, of 10,000 pesos per annum, being 3000 each for two\r\ninquisitors and a fiscal and 1000 for a notary. Although the tribunal\r\nstarted with but one inquisitor, the thrifty receiver, or treasurer,\r\ncollected the salaries of two and, when called to account, claimed that\r\nhe spent the money on the maintenance of poor prisoners. The treasury\r\nofficials had no authority to allow this and refused further\r\ndisbursements till the amount was made good but, when Philip was\r\nappealed to, he ordered, by a cédula of December 23, 1574, the\r\nreceiver’s claim to be allowed.[422] Thus early began the long-continued\r\nbickering between the Holy Office and the treasury, which Philip had\r\nalready, in 1572, endeavored to quiet by instructing the inquisitors to\r\nobtain their salaries direct from the viceroy and not from\r\nsubordinates, whom he forbade them to prosecute or excommunicate for the\r\npurpose of enforcing their demands.[423]\r\n\r\nWhile Philip had provided liberally for the superior officials, he had\r\ntaken no thought of the minor positions and, in spite of the solemnity\r\nof the autos de fe and the successful persecution of heresy, the\r\ninternal working of the tribunal was pursued under difficulties, in the\r\nabsence of resources from confiscations. A curious insight into these\r\ntroubles is afforded by some correspondence of 1583 with\r\nInquisitor-general Quiroga by the two inquisitors, Santos García and\r\nBonilla. It seems that their _portero_ or apparitor, Pedro de Fonseca,\r\nhad exhibited to them a commission, which he had secretly obtained from\r\nQuiroga, promoting him to the post of notary of sequestrations. They met\r\nthis piece of jobbery with the favorite inquisitorial formula--_obedecer\r\ny no cumplir_, obeying without executing--for they say they obeyed it\r\nwithout admitting him to the office until they could consult the\r\ncardinal. This notariate, they say, is the least necessary of offices,\r\nas there are no sequestrations or confiscations, and they have no other\r\nportero and no money wherewith to pay a substitute: besides, Pedro is\r\ndestitute of all qualifications for the position. If a good salary could\r\nbe assured, proper persons would apply for the position but, in the\r\nabsence of salaries, the offices have not a good reputation and people\r\nsay they are bestowed on any one who will accept them. In view of the\r\npoverty of the tribunal and small prospect of improvement they repeat\r\nwhat they had previously said that, if the king will not provide for it,\r\nit had better be abolished rather than maintained precariously, with the\r\nofficers relying on the hope of confiscations that never come, so that\r\none resigns today and another tomorrow, leaving only the alcaide and\r\nportero, who are so poor that they would also have gone if they saw\r\nother means of escaping their creditors. It is therefore suggested that,\r\nin addition to the two inquisitors, the fiscal and the notary, salaries\r\nbe furnished of 600 ducats for an alguazil, 500 for an alcaide or\r\ngaoler and 400 for a messenger--or otherwise that, as in Spain, a\r\ncanonry be suppressed for the benefit of the Inquisition, in each of the\r\neleven bishoprics of the district, though this would have its\r\ndisadvantages in view of the poverty of the churches and paucity of\r\nministers. Then, in another letter the inquisitors announce that they\r\nhave filled the vacant post of alguazil by appointing Don Pedro de\r\nVillegas, for whom they ask Quiroga to send a commission; it is true,\r\nthey say, that he is too young, but then both he and his wife are\r\n_limpio_--free from any taint of heretic blood--and he has the\r\nindispensable qualification of possessing means to live on without a\r\nsalary and that, in the present condition of the Inquisition, is the\r\nmain thing to be considered.[424]\r\n\r\nIt is an emphatic testimony to the exhaustion of the royal treasury that\r\nso pious a monarch as Philip II should have shown indifference to this\r\ndeplorable condition of a tribunal which had already given evidence so\r\nconspicuous of its services to the faith, but he remained deaf to all\r\nappeals and it was left to struggle on as best it could. As the number\r\nof its reconciled penitents increased it felt the need of a _carcel\r\nperpetua_ or penitential prison, for their confinement and, having no\r\nfunds wherewith to purchase a building, it besieged the Marquis of\r\nMonterey, the viceroy, for an appropriation. In 1596 he yielded in so\r\nfar as to authorize the treasurer to lend the tribunal 2000 pesos, on\r\nits giving security to return the money in case the royal approbation\r\nshould not be had within two years. The term elapsed without it, but\r\nPhilip III, September 13, 1599, graciously approved the expenditure, at\r\nthe same time warning the viceroy not to repeat such liberality without\r\nprevious permission.[425] Even though the monarchs were thus niggardly,\r\nthere were advantages in serving the Inquisition which in many cases\r\nanswered in lieu of salary, for official position conferred the _fuero_\r\nor right to the jurisdiction of the Inquisition as well as substantial\r\nexemptions. As early as 1572, Philip II decreed that, during the royal\r\npleasure, the inquisitors, the fiscal, the judge of confiscations, one\r\nsecretary, one receiver, one messenger and the alcaide of the secret\r\nprison should be exempt from taxation and the royal officials were\r\nordered, under penalty of a thousand ducats and punishment at the king’s\r\npleasure, to observe this and protect them in all the honors and\r\nexemptions which such officials enjoyed in Spain.[426]\r\n\r\nA further, although illegal, relief was found by sharing in the\r\n_repartimientos_ under which the Indians were allotted to Spaniards who\r\nlived upon their enforced labor. It is to this cruel system that Las\r\nCasas, Mendieta and Torquemada attribute the rapid wasting away of the\r\nnatives and the hatred which they bore to the Spaniards. Among other\r\nattempts to diminish the evils arising from the system, repeated laws of\r\n1530, 1532, 1542, 1551 and 1563 prohibited the allotment of Indians to\r\nany officials or to prelates, clerics, religious houses, hospitals,\r\nfraternities, etc. In spite of this, as soon as the Inquisition was\r\nestablished, it claimed and was allowed its quota in the allotments. It\r\nwatched vigilantly, moreover, to see that it was not defrauded in any\r\nway, for one of its earliest recorded acts, in 1572, was the prosecution\r\nof Diego de Molina, the _repartidor de los Indios_ of San Juan, because,\r\nin allotting the Indians of that place, the twelve assigned to the\r\nInquisition proved to be boys and incapables, while the useful ones, who\r\ncould be hired out advantageously, such as carpenters and masons, he\r\ngave for bribes to others. He was mercifully let off with five days’\r\nimprisonment and a forcible warning and doubtless served as a wholesome\r\nexample to other partitioners.[427] Like most of the salutary\r\nlegislation of Spain, it seems to have been impossible to enforce the\r\nprohibition, and that the Inquisition continued to enjoy the unpaid\r\nservice of Indian serfs is manifested by its being specifically\r\nincluded in subsequent repetitions of the law in 1609, 1627 and\r\n1635.[428]\r\n\r\nWhen, as we have seen, the Judaizers commenced to appear among the\r\npenitents in the autos de fe, the longed-for relief derivable from\r\nconfiscations, fines and penances was at hand. Spanish finance was\r\nalready suffering the distress which was to become so acute and the\r\ntreasury naturally looked to find its burden lightened by the income\r\nfrom these sources. It looked in vain, for whatever the tribunal\r\nacquired from its victims it retained and it persisted, with incredible\r\naudacity, in refusing even to render an account, although the\r\nconfiscations belonged to the crown which never renounced its claim to\r\nthem. In 1618 a royal cédula required the receiver to render itemized\r\nstatements of all receipts and expenditures; in 1621 Philip IV sought to\r\nenforce this by ordering his viceroys in the Indies not to pay salaries\r\nuntil proof should be furnished that the confiscations were insufficient\r\nto meet them in whole or in part, and this was to be observed\r\ninviolably, no matter what urgency there might be, but repetitions of\r\nthe decree, in 1624 and 1629, show how completely it was ignored.[429]\r\nNot the slightest attention was paid to these repeated royal commands\r\nand, to the last, the Inquisition never permitted either the king or the\r\nCouncil of Indies to know what it acquired in this manner, although the\r\nsums were large and the tribunal became wealthy through investments of\r\nthe surplus, besides making, with more or less regularity, very\r\nconsiderable remittances to the Suprema.\r\n\r\nFinding himself thus baffled by the immovable resistance of the Holy\r\nOffice, Philip, in 1627, sought to relieve his treasury by despoiling\r\nthe Church. He reported to Urban VIII that he expended 32,000 ducats a\r\nyear on the tribunals of Mexico, Lima and Cartagena, wherefore he prayed\r\nthat the bull of Paul IV, January 7, 1559, suppressing a prebend in\r\nevery cathedral and collegial church in Spain, for the benefit of the\r\nInquisition, might be extended to the Indies. Urban complied in a brief\r\nof March 10, 1627, whereupon Philip ordered the archbishop and bishops\r\nto remit to the senior inquisitors of their respective tribunals the\r\nfruits of the prebends as they should fall in, furnishing, at the same\r\ntime, to the royal officials a statement of the sums thus paid, so that\r\nthe amount should be deducted from the salaries.[430] Receipts from this\r\nsource commenced at once and went on increasing as vacancies occurred,\r\namounting, according to the estimate of the Council of Indies, to 30,000\r\npesos per annum for the three tribunals, while the Suprema admitted that\r\nthose of Mexico and Lima produced about 11,000 pesos each, but those of\r\nCartagena, it said, yielded only about 5000.[431]\r\n\r\nDuring this time there had been frequent collisions between the\r\ninquisitors and the treasury officials, arising from the refusal of the\r\nformer to reveal the amount of the confiscations and penances and the\r\nobedience, more or less persistent, of the latter to the royal commands\r\nto require such statements as a condition precedent to paying the royal\r\nsubvention. In these collisions the inquisitors enforced their demands\r\nas usual by prosecution and excommunication, giving rise to unseemly\r\ncontroversies and, when the Suprema forbade their use of such measures,\r\nthey were reduced to impotence. In a letter of February 13, 1634, they\r\ncomplained bitterly of this; during 1633, they said, in spite of all\r\ntheir efforts, they received no money until October, after all the royal\r\nofficials had been paid and, as they had no other means of support, they\r\nwere exposed to the deepest humiliations.[432] The suppressed canonries,\r\nhowever, introduced an element of pacification and, in the Concordia of\r\n1633, between the Suprema and the Council of Indies, a plan to harmonize\r\ndifferences was agreed upon which was a practical surrender to the\r\nInquisition. It provided that every year, before the first _tercios_\r\n(four months’ instalments in advance) were paid, the receivers should\r\nrender a sworn itemized statement of all receipts and expenditures,\r\nincluding confiscations, fines and penances, in accordance with the\r\nroyal cédulas and, when this was delivered to the viceroy, the tercios\r\nshould be paid in advance without delay. If the treasury officials\r\nshould take exception to any portion of the statement, they were to\r\nforward it with their comments to the Council of Indies, but this was\r\nnot to interfere with the prompt payment of the salaries and the\r\ninquisitors were to furnish the Suprema with their explanations. If the\r\nstatement should show a surplus applicable to the salaries, this was, if\r\nagreed to by both parties, to be deducted from the second tercio; but if\r\nthe inquisitors presented any reasons why this tercio should be paid in\r\nfull, the treasury should pay it and the question be referred for\r\nsettlement to the two Councils. The inquisitors were not to proceed\r\nagainst the treasury officials with censures or fines or other\r\npenalties, but were to apply to the viceroy, to whom positive\r\ninstructions were sent to pay them punctually, both the arrearages then\r\nunpaid and the current salaries, while any fines or penalties that had\r\nbeen imposed were to be withdrawn or, if collected, to be refunded.[433]\r\n\r\nThis elaborate arrangement is only of importance as showing that, in\r\nspite of the suppressed canonries, the treasury was still required to\r\nsupport the tribunal and that the latter could be bound by no agreements\r\nhowever solemnly entered into. Except at Cartagena it was never carried\r\ninto effect. No statement of receipts was ever rendered. In 1651, Count\r\nAlva de Aliste, the viceroy, reported to Philip IV that he had no means\r\nof learning what the confiscations amounted to but, on cautiously\r\nsounding the inquisitors, they told him that they reported them to the\r\nSuprema and would obey its instructions. They might well keep the facts\r\nsecret. In the exterminating persecution of the wealthy New Christians,\r\nduring the decade 1640-50, of which more hereafter, the confiscations\r\nwere very large, placing the tribunal at its ease for all future time,\r\nbesides what was embezzled by the inquisitors. The auto of 1646 yielded\r\n38,732 pesos; that of 1647, 148,562. What was gathered in two autos held\r\nin 1648 does not appear, but between November 20, 1646, and April 24,\r\n1648, the inquisitors remitted 234,000 pesos in bills of exchange while\r\nthe crowning auto of 1649 furnished three millions more.[434] In spite\r\nof this enormous influx of wealth, the Inquisition still maintained its\r\ngrip on the royal subvention of 10,000 pesos per annum, though for how\r\nlong it is impossible to determine with positiveness. In the prolonged\r\ncontroversy which raged between the Suprema and the Council of Indies\r\nover the relations of the colonial tribunals, the former, in 1667,\r\npositively declared that, after 1633, there had been no subvention paid\r\nin Mexico or Lima and this assertion was repeated in 1676, but the\r\nstatements of the Suprema are so full of duplicity that no reliance can\r\nbe reposed in them.[435] On the other hand, in 1668, we find the Council\r\nof Indies earnestly advising the king to withdraw the subvention on the\r\nground that the tribunals were rich and could support themselves, as\r\nthey do in Castile; in 1675 it speaks of the payments as still\r\ncontinuing and urges their discontinuance without consulting the\r\nSuprema, as it is a matter wholly within the control of the treasury\r\nand, in 1676, Carlos II answered the Suprema by demanding a prompt\r\ndecision as to a proposition made by the Council of Indies to\r\ndiscontinue the subventions enjoyed by the three tribunals for the\r\nsalaries of their officials.[436] When they were definitely discontinued\r\nit would be impossible to assert, but it is probable that those of\r\nMexico and Lima were stopped in 1677, while that of Cartagena was\r\nprolonged even later. In 1683 Inquisitor Valera of that tribunal\r\ncomplained that, owing to the exhaustion of the public treasury through\r\nwars and piratical attacks, an arrearage had accumulated of thirty-three\r\n_tercios_. He claimed that the king was indebted to the tribunal in the\r\nsum of 58,000 pesos and he urged its transfer to Santa Fe, where the\r\nroyal treasury was in better condition to meet the obligation. The\r\ntransfer was not made, payments of the subvention became more and more\r\nirregular and we shall see that in 1706 the tribunal was still\r\nunavailingly endeavoring to enforce them.[437]\r\n\r\nIn a letter to the king, July 31, 1651, the viceroy, Alva de Aliste,\r\ntook the ground that the subvention had been merely a loan, to be repaid\r\nwhen confiscations should come in, and as, within the last few years,\r\nthese had been large enough to settle the debt, he had had the accounts\r\nexamined and had found that, since the beginning, there had been\r\nadvanced for salaries 559,189 pesos, 6 tomines and 5 granos and, for\r\nother purposes, 6837 pesos, 5 granos, wherefore he suggested that the\r\nking should compel restitution of this amount.[438] To a treasury so\r\ndesperately embarrassed as that of Spain the prospect of such relief was\r\nmost welcome. Philip referred the viceroy’s letter to the Council of\r\nIndies, which delayed its reply till December 12, 1652, when it advised\r\nthe king that examination showed that the salaries were to be defrayed\r\nby the confiscations, which were to be reported to the treasury. The\r\nonly light that could be thrown upon the subject was to be sought in the\r\nregistration, by the Contratacion of Seville, of the amounts of silver\r\npassing through it from Mexico and Peru and from these registers it\r\nappeared that the colonial tribunals had remitted to the Suprema the\r\naggregate of 76,965 _pesos de ensayados_ and 85,454 _pesos de á ocho_,\r\nthus showing that those tribunals had revenues largely in advance of\r\ntheir needs. In view of the magnitude of the sums furnished by the\r\ntreasury, the extensive confiscations, the income of the suppressed\r\ncanonries and the dire necessities of the royal finances, it therefore\r\nadvised the king to call upon the Suprema for restitution and to furnish\r\nstatements of the amount of the confiscations from the beginning. To\r\nthis the king replied, in the ordinary formula of approval “It is well\r\nand so have I ordered.”[439] When the Suprema was concerned, however,\r\nobedience by no means followed royal orders and so it proved in this\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nPhilip’s weakness was shown in his next despatch to the viceroy,\r\nFebruary 1, 1653, in which he said that he had determined that the\r\nSuprema should arrange to make restitution and that, to facilitate a\r\nproper adjustment of the matter, it should furnish a statement of all\r\nconfiscations from the beginning, “for neither my Council of Indies nor\r\nmy viceroys have been able to obtain this, but only the records of the\r\nshipments of silver from the Indies.”[440] There is no evidence that the\r\nSuprema made any attempt to obey the royal commands or that it paid any\r\nattention to a reiterated demand made on August 12, 1655. Then the\r\neffort seems to have been abandoned and the matter was allowed to\r\nslumber until attention was called to it again in 1666. Philip had\r\nwritten, August 12, 1665, to the Marquis of Mansera, then Mexican\r\nviceroy, urging him to extinguish the debt of 1,333,264 pesos, by which\r\namount the Mexican treasury was in arrears with its payments. The\r\nviceroy replied, September 5, 1666, pointing out the difficulty of\r\naccomplishing this and, at the same time, keeping up the remittances by\r\nthe fleet, which were imperatively required by the absolute needs of the\r\nmonarchy. He added that one of the chief causes of the indebtedness was\r\nthe large sums withdrawn from it by the salaries and expenses of the\r\nInquisition since its foundation in 1570; this had been intended as a\r\nloan, until it could be repaid from the confiscations, fines and\r\npenances but, although these had been large, restitution had never been\r\nmade. The cédula of 1653 had inferred that the matter would be settled\r\nbetween the two councils and therefore the viceroys were powerless, but\r\nhe suggested that the tribunal was rich and held large amounts of\r\nproperty; it had the disposition, which it might not have in future, to\r\ncommence making this just and long overdue payment. This despatch the\r\nCouncil of Indies reported to the queen-regent, together with copies of\r\nthe royal cédulas of 1653 and 1655, in order that she might compel the\r\nSuprema to make restitution, not only of the sums reported by Count Alva\r\nde Aliste, but of what had since been paid to the tribunal, seeing that\r\nit had the means to do so and was remitting such large amounts to the\r\nSuprema.[441]\r\n\r\nIt is scarce worth while to follow in detail the discussion which\r\nensued, lasting, with true Spanish procrastination, until 1677, when the\r\neffort to make the Inquisition refund seems to have been abandoned out\r\nof sheer weariness. Of course the feeble queen-regent and the feebler\r\nboy-king, Carlos II, failed in the attempt and the only importance to us\r\nof the debate lies in the falsehoods and prevarications of the Suprema’s\r\ndefence. It was notorious that there had been heavy confiscations, for\r\npersecution, as we have seen, had become active and exceedingly\r\nprofitable as the half-century had drawn to a close. The tribunal had\r\ngrown rich and had made large investments, besides the enormous\r\nremittances to the Suprema, and these had been derived almost\r\nexclusively from the confiscations and penances. Yet the Suprema\r\nendeavored to make it appear that financially confiscation had been a\r\nfailure. There had been some confiscations, it admitted, in Mexico and\r\nLima; there was the one of Diego López de Fonseca, amounting to 79,965\r\npesos, but Jorje de Paz of Madrid and Simon Rodriguez Bueno of Seville\r\nhad come forward with claims amounting to more. They had asked to have\r\nthe money sent to the receiver of Seville for adjudication and, on its\r\narrival, the king had seized it and, by a cédula of July 14, 1652, had\r\nbound himself to satisfy the claimants, which he did by assigning to\r\nthem certain matters. It was true that, in 1642, a number of Judaizing\r\nPortuguese had been discovered in Mexico, of whom some had moderate\r\nfortunes and one was reputed to be rich, but on the outbreak of the\r\nPortuguese rebellion, for fear that the viceroy would embargo their\r\nproperty, they had concealed it, and although the Inquisition had\r\npublished censures, only a little had been discovered, while there came\r\nforward creditors with evidences of claims amounting to 400,000 pesos,\r\nso that it was difficult to make the confiscations meet them, to say\r\nnothing of the heavy expenses of feeding the prisoners, hiring houses to\r\nserve as prisons and the increased number of officials required. Besides\r\nthis, there was protracted and costly litigation in investigating the\r\nclaims and detecting suspected frauds. For this, Archbishop Mañozca was\r\nappointed visitador; on his death Medina Rico was sent out for the same\r\npurpose and, when he died, the matter had not been settled, nor has it\r\nyet.[442] If the Suprema was to be believed, confiscation cost more\r\nthan it came to.\r\n\r\nIn the same way it sought by garbled statements to conceal the fact that\r\nit was secretly deriving a considerable revenue from the colonial\r\ntribunals, thus proving that they were possessed of superabundant means.\r\nIn its private accounts for the year 1657, there is an item of 10,000\r\nducats from those of Mexico and Lima, with the remark that this is\r\nalways in arrears and is now two years overdue[443]--for the tribunals\r\nwere as anxious as the Suprema to conceal their gains. Yet it could not\r\nhide the fact that it was in receipt of large remittances through the\r\nContratacion of Seville and the Government, in its extremity, had an\r\nawkward habit of seizing what took its fancy and possibly paying for\r\nsilver in vellon, for we chance to hear of such an occurrence in 1639\r\nand again in 1644.[444] The Council of Indies, as we have seen, did not\r\nfail to call attention to the large amounts which it was thus receiving,\r\nbut it airily replied, in its consulta of November 16, 1667, that the\r\nthree tribunals had, at various times, remitted the aggregate of 130,803\r\npesos, 3 reales, as the proceeds of sales of _varas_ or offices of\r\nalguazil, and that this and much more, from the home tribunals,\r\namounting in all to over 700,000 pesos, had been contributed to the\r\nnecessities of the State. It repeated this, May 11, 1676, with the\r\naddition that the colonial tribunals had sent about 8000 pesos to the\r\nfund for the attempted canonization of Pedro Arbués and that there were\r\nalso remittances for the _media añata_ of the officials and for the\r\ndeposits of aspirants to office to defray the expenses of the\r\ninvestigations into _limpieza_--the whole manifesting extreme desire to\r\ndivert attention from the confiscations.[445] In spite of these\r\nsubterfuges there can be no question that the tribunals of Mexico and\r\nLima accumulated vast amounts of property. The magnificence of the\r\npalace of the Mexican tribunal, rebuilt from 1732 to 1736, shows that it\r\ncould gratify its vanity with the most profuse expenditure.[446] That it\r\nwas fully able to do this without impairing its revenues may be assumed\r\nfrom the assertion, in 1767, of the royal fiscal, when arguing a case of\r\ncompetencia before the Audiencia, that if its accumulations were not\r\nchecked, the king would have but a small portion of territory in which\r\nto exercise his jurisdiction.[447] Certain it is that the tribunal\r\ncontinued to be able to render large pecuniary support to the home\r\ninstitution. In 1693 we hear of a remittance of 93,705 pesos and in 1702\r\nof 19,898 in spite of heavy defalcations by the receivers. This was\r\nfollowed by remittances of 40,000 pesos in 1706, of 16,500 in 1720, and\r\nof 31,500 in 1727. In 1771 the tribunal lent to the viceroy, for the\r\nemergencies of the war with England, 60,000 pesos, which were repaid,\r\nand, in 1795, a further loan was made of 40,000 to aid in the war then\r\nraging.[448] As late as 1809 the Government seized a remittance from it\r\nto the Suprema of 60,131-1/2 pesos and gave a receipt for the proceeds,\r\nbeing 915,886 reales, for which, after the Restoration, we find the\r\nSuprema claiming restitution.[449] In spite of these reiterated drains\r\nwe shall see hereafter what wealth the tribunal possessed when\r\nsuppressed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf we are to trust the list of sanbenitos hung in the cathedral of\r\nMexico, after the great auto of 1601, there ensued a period of\r\ncomparative inaction for nearly half a century, in which Protestants\r\nalmost disappeared and were replaced by comparatively few\r\nJudaizers.[450] The sanbenitos however represent only the serious cases\r\nand the tribunal continued to gather its customary harvest of bigamists,\r\nblasphemers, sorcerers, solicitors and other minor offenders, some of\r\nwhom yielded a liberal amount of fines.[451] In fact, a report of the\r\ncases pending in 1625 amounts to the very considerable number of\r\nsixty-three, showing that there was ample business on hand, receiving\r\nattention with more or less diligence.[452] After this however the\r\nactivity of the tribunal diminished so greatly that, on July 12, 1638,\r\nit reported that it had not a single case pending, and a year later that\r\nit had but one, which was against a priest charged with solicitation in\r\nthe confessional.[453] This is a singular tribute to the efficacy of the\r\nEdict of Faith--a proclamation requiring, under pain of excommunication,\r\nthe denunciation of all offences enumerated under it, of which any one\r\nmight be cognizant or have heard of in any way. According to rule, this\r\nshould be solemnly published every year in all parish and conventual\r\nchurches; it kept the faithful on the watch for all aberrations and\r\nrendered every one a spy and an informer. It had, however, at this time,\r\nfallen into desuetude. In a letter of February 13, 1634, the inquisitors\r\nsay that for ten years the publications had been suspended in\r\nconsequence of the indecency which attended it after the viceroys\r\nrefused to be present, owing to quarrels as to ceremonial, and they ask\r\nthat a royal order should be issued through the Council of Indies\r\nrequiring the attendance of the civil magistracy in the procession and\r\npublication.[454]\r\n\r\nNearly ten years more, however, were to elapse, before the questions of\r\netiquette and precedence were settled, and at last, on March 1, 1643,\r\nthe Edict was read with all solemnity in the cathedral of Mexico and was\r\nfollowed by an abundant harvest of denunciations.[455] How numerous\r\nthese habitually were may be gathered from partial statistics of those\r\nreceived after a publication of the Edict in 1650. These were recorded\r\nin eight books, of which four, representing presumably one-half, have\r\nbeen preserved, containing altogether two hundred and fifty-four cases\r\nof the most varied character, as may be seen by the summarized\r\nclassification below.[456]\r\n\r\nThe most significant feature in this mass of so-called testimony is the\r\nmanner in which the most trivial acts inferring suspicion were watched\r\nand denounced, so that every man lived under a universal spy-system\r\nstimulated by the readiness of the Inquisition to listen to and make\r\nrecord of the veriest gossip passing from mouth to mouth. Thus one\r\ninformer relates how in 1642, eight years before, he saw Simon de\r\nParedes quietly put to one side on his plate a piece of pork that came\r\nto him from among the miscellaneous contents of the olla. Another\r\ngravely deposes how a man had casually told him that he had heard how a\r\nminer named Blas Garcés, of the mines of Los Papagayos, now dead, had\r\nonce taken some of the herb Peyote to find some mines of which he had\r\nchanced to see specimens, and the marvels which thence ensued.[457] From\r\nthe book of _Membretes_ kept by the tribunal it would appear that when\r\nthis kind of evidence did not lead to a prosecution it was carefully\r\npreserved and indexed for reference in case of subsequent testimony\r\nagainst an individual. Such was the training of the population and such\r\nwas the shadow of terror under which every man lived.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, during the quiescent period of the tribunal, the class of New\r\nChristians, who secretly adhered to the ancient faith, increased and\r\nprospered, accumulating wealth through the opportunities of the colonial\r\ntrade which they virtually monopolized. Their fancied security, however,\r\nwas approaching its end. The vigorous measures taken in Spain, between\r\n1625 and 1640, to exterminate the Portuguese Judaizers, revealed the\r\nnames of many accomplices who had found refuge in the New World; these\r\nwere carefully noted and sent to the colonial tribunals.[458] Moreover,\r\nfrom 1634 to 1639, the Lima Inquisition was busy in detecting and\r\npunishing a large number of its most prominent merchants guilty of the\r\nsame apostasy, who had relations with their Mexican brethren, revealed\r\nduring the trials. The tribunal seems to have been somewhat slow in\r\nrealizing the opportunities thus afforded, but in 1642 there opened an\r\nera of active and relentless persecution which was equally effective in\r\nenriching its treasury and in purifying the faith. To prevent the escape\r\nof its victims, on July 9th it sent orders to Vera Cruz prohibiting the\r\nembarkation of any Portuguese who could not show a special licence from\r\nit. A wealthy merchant named Manuel Alvarez de Arrellano had already\r\nsailed for Spain, but his ship was wrecked on Santo Domingo and he was\r\ncompelled to return to Havana. The tribunal was on his track and, on\r\nDecember 1st, it sent orders to its commissioner at Havana to arrest\r\nhim, seize all his property, sell it at auction and send him in chains\r\nwith the proceeds to Vera Cruz. This was successfully accomplished and,\r\nin acknowledging his arrival, the tribunal gave further instructions as\r\nto some cases of cochineal, which it understood to have been saved from\r\nthe wreck.[459]\r\n\r\nThere was small chance of escape for any culprit. The New Christians\r\nwere closely connected by family, religious and business ties, and each\r\nnew prisoner was forced to implicate his friends and kindred. Gabriel de\r\nGranada, a child of 13, arrested in July, 1642, was made to give\r\nevidence against 108 persons, including his entire family.[460] There\r\nwere then three inquisitors, Francisco de Estrada y Escobedo, Bernabé de\r\nla Higuera y Amarilla and Juan Saenz de Mañozca, whose names became a\r\nterror to the innocent as well as to the guilty. Their cruel zeal is\r\nmanifested in a letter to the Suprema virtually asking authority to\r\nrelax ten persons, although they had confessed and professed repentance\r\nin time to entitle them, by the rules of the Inquisition, to\r\nreconciliation.[461] It was a wild revel of prosecutions and\r\ncondemnations. Medina Rico, the _visitador_ or inspector who came in\r\n1654, reported that, in reviewing the proceedings, he found that no\r\nattention had been paid to the defences presented by the accused,\r\nalthough in many cases they were just. A single case will indicate the\r\nheartlessness of the tribunal. September 24, 1646, Doña Catalina de\r\nCampos sought an audience to say that she was very sick and near unto\r\ndeath and that she would die in the Catholic faith in which she had\r\nlived. She was sent back to her cell, no attention was paid to her and\r\nsome days later she was found dead and gnawed by rats.[462]\r\n\r\nThe result of this method of administering justice was a succession of\r\n_autos particulares_, in 1646, 1647 and 1648, followed by an _auto\r\ngeneral_ in 1649.\r\n\r\nIn 1646 there were thirty-eight Judaizers reconciled and, as\r\nreconciliation, in addition to prison and sanbenito, inferred\r\nconfiscation, the harvest as we have seen was large. In 1647 the number\r\nwas twenty-one.[463] In 1648 there were two autos--a public one on March\r\n29th and an _auto particular_ in the Jesuit church on March 30th. In the\r\nformer there were eleven penitents for various offences, eight Judaizers\r\npenanced and eight reconciled, two reconciliations for Mahometanism,\r\ntwenty-one effigies of Judaizers burnt and one burning in person. In the\r\nlatter there was one penitent brought from the Philippines for suspicion\r\nof Mahometanism, who escaped with abjuration _de levi_ and servitude for\r\nlife in a convent for instruction; there were two for personating\r\npriesthood and administering sacraments without orders, who received 300\r\nand 200 lashes respectively and were sent to the galleys; one for\r\nmarrying in orders, who abjured _de vehementi_ and was sent to serve in\r\na hospital for five years; a bigamist who had 200 lashes and the\r\ngalleys; a _curandera_, who employed charms to cure disease and was\r\nvisited with 200 lashes and perpetual exile from Puebla, and finally\r\nthere were twenty-one Judaizers. Of these, two escaped with fines of\r\n2000 and 3000 ducats respectively and perpetual exile from Mexico, one\r\nwas only exiled and eighteen were reconciled with confiscation and\r\nvarious terms of imprisonment, in addition to which five of them were\r\nscourged and, of these latter, two were also sent to the galleys.[464]\r\n\r\nThe great _auto general_ of April 11, 1649, marks the apogee of the\r\nMexican Inquisition and of this we have a very florid account, written\r\nby an official.[465] A month in advance the solemn proclamation\r\nannouncing it was made in Mexico, March 11th, with a gorgeous\r\nprocession, to the sound of trumpet and drum, and this had previously\r\nbeen sent to every town in New Spain, so that it was published\r\neverywhere at the same hour. Consequently, for a fortnight in advance of\r\nthe appointed day, crowds began to pour in, some of them from a distance\r\nof a hundred or two hundred leagues, till, as we are told, it looked as\r\nthough the country had been depopulated. The reporter exhausts his\r\neloquence in describing the magnificence of the procession of the Green\r\nCross, on the afternoon preceding the auto, when all the nobles and\r\ngentlemen of the city, in splendid holiday attire, took part, and the\r\nstandard of the Inquisition was borne by the Count of Santiago, whose\r\ngrandfather had done the same in the great auto of 1574 and his father\r\nin that of 1601. A double line of coaches extended through the streets,\r\nfrom the Inquisition to the plazuela del Volador, where the ceremonies\r\nwere to be performed, and so anxious were their occupants not to lose\r\ntheir positions that they remained in them all night and until the show\r\nwas over. It might seem that all Mexico, from the highest to the lowest,\r\nwas assembled to demonstrate the ardor of its faith and to gain the\r\nindulgence which the Vicar of Christ bestowed on those who were present\r\nat these crowning exhibitions of the triumph of the Church Militant.\r\nInside of the Inquisition the night was spent in notifying of their\r\napproaching fate those who were about to die and in preparing them for\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nOf the one hundred and nine convicts there was but one Protestant, a\r\nFrenchman named François Razin, condemned to abjure for vehement\r\nsuspicion of heresy and to two years’ service in a convent for\r\ninstructions; as he was penniless, we are told that he was not fined.\r\nThere were nine Judaizers who abjured for vehement suspicion and were\r\nbanished to Spain; three of them, being impoverished, were not fined but\r\non the other six were imposed mulcts, ranging from 1000 to 6000 ducats,\r\namounting in all to 15,000 ducats and one in addition had 200 lashes.\r\nThere were nineteen reconciled, whose estates of course were\r\nconfiscated, as also were those of the relaxed, seventy-eight in number.\r\nOf these, fifty-seven were effigies of the dead, of whom ten had died in\r\nprison, two of the latter being suicides, in addition to which were\r\neight effigies of fugitives. Thirteen were relaxed in person, but of\r\nthese twelve were garroted before burning, having professed repentance\r\nand conversion in time. Only one was burnt alive--the hero of the\r\noccasion, Tomás Treviño of Sobremonte. His mother had been burnt at\r\nValladolid, and nearly all of his kindred, as well as those of his wife,\r\nhad been inmates of the Inquisition. He had been reconciled in the auto\r\nof 1625 and there could be no mercy for a relapsed apostate, though he\r\ncould have escaped the fiery death by professing conversion again. He\r\nhad lain in prison for five years during his trial, always denying his\r\nguilt, but when notified of his conviction, the night before the auto,\r\nhe proclaimed himself a Jew, declaring that he would die as such, nor\r\ncould the combined efforts of all the assembled confessors shake his\r\nresolution. To silence what were styled his blasphemies, he was taken to\r\nthe auto gagged, in spite of which he made audible assertion of his\r\nfaith and of his contempt for Christianity. It is related that, after\r\nhis sentence, when he was mounted to be taken to the quemadero, the\r\npatient mule assigned to him refused to carry so great a sinner; six\r\nothers were tried with the same result and he was obliged to walk until\r\na broken-down horse was brought, which had not spirit enough to dislodge\r\nits unholy burden. An Indian was mounted behind him, who sought to\r\nconvert him and, enraged at his failure, beat him about the mouth to\r\ncheck his blasphemies. Undaunted to the last, he drew the blazing brands\r\ntowards him with his feet and his last audible words were--“Pile on the\r\nwood; how much my money costs me!”[466]\r\n\r\nThe inquisitor-general, Arce y Reynoso, on October 15, 1649,\r\ncongratulated Philip IV on this triumph of the faith, which had been the\r\nsource of joy and consolation and universal applause, whereat the pious\r\nmonarch expressed his gratification and desired the inquisitors to be\r\nthanked in his name. As summarized by Arce y Reynoso the results of the\r\nfour autos were two hundred and seven penitents of whom a hundred and\r\nninety were Jews, nearly all Portuguese. There was one drawback to his\r\nsatisfaction. The penitents sentenced to banishment were directed to be\r\nsent to Spain, and repeated royal orders required that they should be\r\ntransported free of charge, but the captains of all vessels, both naval\r\nand commercial, refused to carry them without pay and, as they had been\r\nstripped of all their possessions, they could not defray the\r\npassage-money themselves, while the Inquisition made no offer to supply\r\nthe funds. Consequently they remained in Vera Cruz or wandered through\r\nthe land, throwing off their sanbenitos and infecting the population\r\nwith their errors. Arce y Reynoso suggested to the king that he should\r\ngive them rations while on board ship so as to help to bring them over.\r\nIt never seemed to occur to him that the Inquisition, which was\r\nenriching itself with their confiscations, could spare the trifle\r\nrequisite for the execution of its sentences on these homeless and\r\npenniless wretches.[467]\r\n\r\nAfter this supreme manifestation of its authority, the Inquisition\r\nbecame again somewhat inert, for its attention was largely absorbed in\r\nsettling the details of the confiscations which involved the greater\r\nportion of Mexican commerce.[468] The tribunal had its routine business\r\nof bigamists, soliciting confessors and women guilty of so-called\r\nsorcery--cases usually despatched in the audience-chamber--though there\r\nwas an _auto particular_ celebrated October 29, 1656. In 1659, however,\r\nthere was a public auto on November 19th which, though not large, merits\r\nattention by its severity and the peculiarity of some of the\r\ndelinquents. Of these there were thirty-two in all--twelve blasphemers,\r\ntwo bigamists, one forger, one false witness, one for violating the\r\nsecrecy of the prison, one who had been reconciled for Judaism in 1649\r\nand had thrown off the sanbenito, a woman for suspicion of Judaism, an\r\nalumbrado, or mystic, with visions and revelations. Then there were two\r\nsisters Romero, prosecuted for fraudulent visions and revelations, of\r\nwhom one was acquitted and the other had 200 lashes and ten years’\r\nservice in a hospital--a third sister having been penanced in the auto\r\nparticular of 1656. There was also Manuel Méndez, a Portuguese,\r\nsuspected of Judaism, who had died in prison and was now acquitted.\r\nAnother Portuguese, Diego Díaz, was not so fortunate; he had been\r\ncondemned in 1649 to abjuration _de vehementi_ and perpetual banishment,\r\nbut he did not leave Mexico; arrested February 26, 1652, he had lain in\r\nprison awaiting an auto and was now sentenced to be burnt alive as\r\npertinaciously impenitent; by mistake the executioner commenced to\r\ngarrote him, but was stopped by the alguazil mayor, who ordered the fire\r\nlighted, so that he had both punishments. Similar was the case of\r\nFrancisco Botello, arrested in 1642, sentenced in 1649 to 200 lashes and\r\nbanishment, remaining in Mexico, arrested again in 1650 and now garroted\r\nand burnt. These two cases indicate the treatment accorded to those\r\nalluded to above, who, after being stripped of their property, were\r\nordered to leave the country, but were not furnished with means to do\r\nso.\r\n\r\nAnother convict, Francisco López de Aponte, was accused of pact with the\r\ndemon and of heresies. He gave signs of insanity, but on examination by\r\nphysicians was pronounced sane. Under severe torture he remained\r\nperfectly quiescent and insensible to pain, which could only be\r\nexplained by diabolical aid, so he was shaved all over and inspected\r\ncarefully for charms or for the devil’s mark, but in vain. A second\r\ntorture was endured with the same indifference and he was condemned to\r\nrelaxation as an apostate heretic. On the night before the auto he said\r\nto the confessor who endeavored to convert him “There is no God, nor\r\nhell, nor glory; it is all a lie; there is birth and death and that is\r\nall.” During the auto he manifested no emotion and was burnt alive as an\r\nimpenitent.\r\n\r\nJuan Gomez had been arrested, May 28, 1658, as an Illuminist and\r\n_herége sacramentario_, for teaching many opinions contrary to the\r\nCatholic faith. Condemned to relaxation, he maintained his heresies\r\nuntil, during the auto, he weakened and professed repentance,\r\nnotwithstanding which he was burnt alive.\r\n\r\nPedro García de Arias was a wandering hermit who, although uneducated,\r\nhad written three mystic books containing erroneous doctrine. When on\r\ntrial he claimed that he had never committed sin, and he abused the\r\nInquisition, for which he was scourged through the streets with 200\r\nlashes. When notified of his condemnation to relaxation he protested\r\nthat he would not beg for mercy, but on the staging he asked for an\r\naudience, in which he insisted that there were no errors in what he had\r\nwritten. Nevertheless he was garroted before burning, when his books,\r\nhung around his neck, were consumed with him.\r\n\r\nSebastian Alvárez was an old man who claimed to be Jesus Christ, but was\r\npronounced to be sane by the experts who examined him. He persisted in\r\nhis delusion and was sentenced to relaxation. On the staging he asked\r\nfor an audience and was remanded to the Inquisition, where two days\r\nlater he had an audience and, as he still asserted himself to be Christ,\r\nhe was sentenced to burning alive if he did not retract. On the way to\r\nthe quemadero he retracted and was garroted before burning.\r\n\r\nIn this curious assemblage of eccentric humanity, the most remarkable of\r\nall was an Irishman named variously William Lamport or Guillen Lombardo\r\nde Guzman. He had lain in prison since his arrest as far back as October\r\n25, 1642, on a denunciation that he was plotting to sever Mexico from\r\nSpain and make himself an independent sovereign, for he claimed to be\r\nthe son of Philip III by an Irish woman, and thus half-brother to Philip\r\nIV. This was his real offence, but the Inquisition claimed jurisdiction\r\nbecause he had consulted an Indian sorcerer and certain astrologers to\r\nassure the success of his enterprise. The details of his scheme show\r\nthat it was suggested by the success with which, in June, 1642, Bishop\r\nPalafox, acting under secret orders from Philip, had ousted from the\r\nviceroyalty the Marquis of Escalona, who was suspected of treasonable\r\nleanings towards João of Braganza and the revolted Portuguese. With the\r\naid of an Indian singularly skilled in forgery, Lamport had drawn up all\r\nthe necessary royal decrees which would enable him to seize control, on\r\nthe arrival of the expected new viceroy, the Count of Salvatierra. Yet\r\nhe was no common adventurer, but a man of wide and various learning,\r\nthoroughly familiar with English, French, Spanish, Italian, Latin and\r\nGreek, with the classical poets and philosophers, with the Scriptures\r\nand the fathers and with theology and mathematics. This was proved by\r\nthe memorials which he drew up in prison, without the aid of books, yet\r\nfull of citations and extracts in all languages and of scripture texts.\r\nThese were scrutinized by the calificador who verified the citations and\r\nfound them all correct and who moreover certified that there were no\r\nerrors of faith.\r\n\r\nIn the account of his life, which all prisoners of the Inquisition were\r\nrequired to give, he stated that he had been born in England, from which\r\nhe had fled in his twelfth year because of a pamphlet entitled _Defensio\r\nFidei_ which he had written against the king. After marvellous\r\nadventures in many regions, in which he had rendered services to Spain,\r\nPhilip IV had summoned him to Madrid, where Olivares patronized him. He\r\nwas then sent to Flanders to aid the Cardinal Infante, to whose success\r\nhe largely contributed, especially at the battle of Nördlingen (1634).\r\nAfter much other service, Philip gave him the title of Marquis of\r\nCropani and the viceroyalty of Mexico, from which he was to eject the\r\noccupant--and for this he held forged royal cédulas. That there was some\r\nresiduum of truth at the bottom of his story would appear from his\r\nfamiliarity with details of persons and events, and there is no doubt\r\nthat he was an object of interest in Madrid, for a royal cédula of May\r\n13, 1643, ordered the case to be expedited and that after his punishment\r\nall his papers should be given to the judge, Andrés Gomez de Mora. Why\r\nthe case should then have been protracted for seventeen years is\r\ninexplicable, unless it was designed to keep him imprisoned for life,\r\nbut, however that may be, he continued to be a source of solicitude,\r\nnot unkindly, for the Suprema, under royal orders, wrote June 21, 1550,\r\nthat he should be given a cell-companion to alleviate his confinement if\r\nhe so desired and that every care should be taken of his life. Again, on\r\nJuly 7, 1660, when the Suprema received the account of his relaxation,\r\nit wrote to ask why this had been done against its express orders.\r\nAltogether the case is a mystery to which the clue is lost.\r\n\r\nDiego Pinto, the companion given to share his confinement, was soon won\r\nover to join him in a plan of escape, which was executed December 26,\r\n1650, with remarkable skill and perseverance. In place of flying to some\r\nsafe retreat Lamport spent the night in affixing in various prominent\r\nplaces certain writings which he had prepared, and in persuading a\r\nsentinel at the palace to convey one to the viceroy urging him to arrest\r\nthe inquisitors as traitors. Towards dawn he induced a householder to\r\ntake him in and awaited the result of his papers, besides writing\r\nothers, when the host became apprehensive and made him remove to another\r\nhouse. No time was lost by the tribunal in issuing a proclamation,\r\ndescribing his person and ordering his capture under severe penalties;\r\nhis host promptly reported him and he was carried back to the\r\nInquisition, when he was lodged in an exceptionally strong cell, his\r\nfeet in stocks and his hands in fetters. In January, 1654, he asked for\r\nwriting materials, with which he composed a tremendous attack on the\r\nInquisition, and during the winter he utilized the sheets of his bed to\r\nwrite a book, which when transcribed proved to be a treatise in Latin\r\nverse which filled 270 closely written pages. He had now lain twelve\r\nyears in prison without trial; his overwrought brain was giving way and\r\nhis insanity became more and more manifest. At last the time for the\r\nauto approached and, on October 8, 1659, without further audience, the\r\naccusation was presented; the trial proceeded swiftly and on November\r\n6th sentence was pronounced, condemning him to relaxation for divination\r\nand superstitious cures showing express or implicit pact with the\r\ndemon, besides which he had plotted rebellion and was a heretic sectary\r\nof Calvin, Pelagius, Huss, Luther and other heresiarchs and an inventor\r\nand dogmatizer of new heresies. As a special punishment for his\r\ndefamatory libels and forgery of royal decrees, he was to listen to his\r\nsentence on the scaffold with a gag and hanging by his right arm\r\nfastened to an iron ring. During the night before the auto he assailed\r\nwith opprobrious epithets the holy men who sought to save his soul; he\r\nexclaimed that a hundred legions of devils had entered his cell with\r\nthem and finally he covered his head with the bed-clothes and refused to\r\nspeak. At the auto on the staging he was like a statue and at the stake\r\nhe escaped burning alive by throwing himself against the iron ring\r\nencircling his throat with such force that it killed him.[469]\r\n\r\nThe last act of the tragedy was the burning of the effigy of Joseph\r\nBruñon de Vertiz, a priest whose offence was that he had been the dupe\r\nof the imposture of the Romero sisters and had reduced to writing their\r\nvisions and revelations. Arrested September 9, 1649, he speedily\r\nadmitted that he had been deceived and cast himself on the mercy of the\r\ninquisitors, vainly endeavoring to ascertain what was the nature of the\r\ncharge against him so that he could confess and retract whatever errors\r\nwere imputed to him. It was not, however, the _estilo_ of the\r\nInquisition to do more than to tell the accused to search his memory and\r\nclear his conscience and after eighteen months of this suspense Bruñon’s\r\nmind commenced to give way. He was left in his cell apparently\r\nforgotten, except when he would seek an audience to ask for writing\r\nmaterials with which, in 1652 and 1654, he drew up and presented attacks\r\nupon the tribunal of a character to show that he was becoming insane\r\nthrough despair. No notice was taken of these ebullitions and on April\r\n30, 1656, he died without the sacraments, after six years and a half of\r\nincarceration, during which he had never been informed of the charges\r\nagainst him. His body was thrust into unconsecrated ground and the trial\r\nwas continued against his fame and memory as an alumbrado heretic, in\r\nan accusation presented May 11, 1657. There was no defence possible by\r\nhis kindred; he was duly condemned and in this auto of November 19,\r\n1659, his effigy was brought forward, clad in priestly garments, the\r\nimpressive ceremony of degradation was performed and it was cast into\r\nthe flames with his bones exhumed for the purpose.[470]\r\n\r\nCruel as all this performance may seem to us, it was in strict\r\nconformity with the convictions of the age and, when Philip IV received\r\nthe report of the auto, he warmly congratulated the inquisitor-general\r\non the vigilance which preserved the purity of the faith by inflicting\r\nmerited chastisement.[471]\r\n\r\nWith this auto the murderous activity of the tribunal may be said\r\nvirtually to end. Until the end of the century its business consisted\r\nalmost exclusively in the commonplace routine of bigamists, blasphemers,\r\npetty sorcerers, soliciting confessors, clerics administering the\r\nsacraments without priest’s orders and the like. Thus in an auto\r\ncelebrated January 15, 1696, out of twenty-six penitents, there was but\r\none heretic with a sanbenito; there was a Greek schismatic reconciled\r\nand the rest were sixteen bigamists, one Franciscan tertiary for\r\nIlluminism, a woman for imposture and four men and two women for the\r\nsuperstitious practices conveniently classed as sorcery with explicit or\r\nimplicit pact with the demon.[472] Yet during this half-century there\r\nwere a couple of cases showing that a nearly bloodless career was not\r\ndue to any surcease of fanatic zeal. In November, 1673, was arrested a\r\nwandering hermit named Juan Bautista de Cardenas, charged with being\r\n_iluso y alumbrado_, with grave suspicion of sacramentarian heresy.\r\nAfter giving the customary account of his life he took refuge in\r\nabsolute silence, which suggested that he was possessed by a demon, but\r\nexorcism proved unavailing. Sharp torture was then tried, but it\r\nelicited only the usual shrieks of pain. The conclusion drawn from this\r\nwas that he was a contumacious heretic and in July, 1675, he was\r\ncondemned to relaxation, when, on being notified of it, he only said\r\nthat if he was carried to the quemadero he would die for God. The\r\ntribunal however did not dare to execute its own sentence and sent the\r\npapers to the Suprema which, June 22, 1676, altered it to abjuration _de\r\nlevi_, deprivation of the habit he wore and exile from the cities of\r\nMexico and Puebla, adding that the torture had been abusive seeing that\r\nhe had not been formally testified against for heresy. The other case\r\nwas that of Fray Francisco Manuel de Cuadros, who had left his Order and\r\npractised as a _curandero_, or curer of disease by charms. He was thrown\r\nin prison, November 14, 1663, and during his trial, which was protracted\r\nfor nearly fifteen years, he confessed to being an agnostic, except as\r\nto the existence of God, but he admitted that he was ignorant and\r\nhalf-crazy. At the auto of March 20, 1679, he was condemned to\r\nrelaxation after degradation, but at the quemadero he showed signs of\r\nrepentance, in virtue of which he was admitted to the sacraments and was\r\nstrangled before burning.[473]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the public autos there is no trace of one of the principal duties of\r\nthe Inquisition in the repression of the prevalent crime of the\r\nseduction of women by their confessors, euphemistically known as\r\nsolicitation in the confessional. Even as bigamy had been brought under\r\ninquisitorial jurisdiction by the somewhat forced assumption that it\r\nimplied erroneous belief in the sacrament of matrimony, so solicitation\r\nwas held to infer in the confessor error as to the sacrament of\r\npenitence. At least this was the reason alleged when, recognizing that\r\nthe spiritual courts were useless to check the practice, Paul IV, in\r\n1561 entrusted its suppression in the Spanish dominions to the\r\nInquisition, and Gregory XV, in 1622, extended this to other lands in\r\nwhich the Holy Office existed. Priests, however, for the avoidance of\r\nscandal, were never paraded in public autos, unless they were to be\r\ndeprived of their orders; their sentences were read in the\r\naudience-chamber with closed doors and in the presence only of a\r\nselected number of their brethren, to whom the fate of the culprit\r\nshould serve as a wholesome warning.[474] While, therefore, the\r\nknowledge of this offence was sedulously kept from the public, it gave\r\nthe tribunal considerable occupation. The morals of the Colonial clergy,\r\nfor the most part, were notoriously loose and, in the solitary missions\r\nand parishes among the natives, evil passions had free rein.[475] This\r\nwas enhanced by the almost assured prospect of immunity, for the women\r\nseduced were the only possible accusers and it has always proved\r\nexceedingly difficult to induce them to denounce their seducers.\r\nNaturally therefore the Inquisition, on its establishment, was speedily\r\ncalled upon to prosecute such culprits and, up to 1577, it already had\r\nfive cases.[476] It seems however not to have enforced its exclusive\r\njurisdiction over the offence if we may judge from the proceedings in\r\nthe case of Fray Juan de Saldaña, in 1583, for when it assumed the\r\nprosecution he was undergoing six months’ imprisonment by his superiors\r\nbecause at Tequitatlan he had violated an Indian girl and, when she\r\nrefused to continue the connection, he had her arrested and flogged,\r\nafter which she submitted. Though only 34 years of age he was a person\r\nof consideration in his Franciscan Order, he had occupied various\r\npositions of importance and at this time was guardian of the convent of\r\nSuchipila, where he seduced three sisters, his penitents, the daughters\r\nof Diego Flores, the _encomendero_ of Suchipila and a person of\r\ndistinction. There seems to have been little or no concealment about it;\r\nhe boasted openly of the women he had seduced, Spanish as well as\r\nIndian, not only in Suchipila but in his visitations, and he evidently\r\nhad no idea that he was incurring risk of the Inquisition, for when\r\nremonstrated with he asked what his prelates could do to him--it was\r\nonly a dozen strokes of the discipline and a year’s suspension from his\r\nguardianship. When brought to trial he was frank in his admissions; two\r\nyears before he had been deprived of confessing Spanish women, but as\r\nguardian he had licence to do so; he mentioned seven Indian women whom\r\nhe had seduced in confession besides a mestizo and several Spaniards. In\r\nthese cases, the accusation of the fiscal and the exordium of the\r\nsentence are eloquently rhetorical as to the heinous guilt in one,\r\nclothed with the awful power of the priesthood, using that power to lead\r\nastray the souls seeking salvation through him, but when it came to\r\ndefining the penalty there is a tenderness which suggests that in\r\nreality the offence was regarded as much less important than aberration\r\non some minute point of faith. When his sentence was read, May 5, 1584,\r\nhe was subjected to the discipline for the space of a _miserere_; he was\r\ndeprived of the faculty of confessing, was suspended from orders for six\r\nyears, was recluded for two years in a convent with the customary\r\ndisabilities and was banished for six years from the see of\r\nGuadalajara.[477]\r\n\r\nSuch treatment was not adapted to strengthen the carnal-minded against\r\ntemptation so severe and the vice flourished accordingly. As the\r\ninquisitors stated in a letter to the Suprema of May 22, 1619, it was a\r\nvery frequent offence in those parts and many confessors regarded it as\r\ntrivial,[478] and the list of cases of solicitation for the years 1622-4\r\ncontains fifty-six names, of which seven were from Manila, for the\r\nPhilippines were a dependency of the Mexican tribunal. That leniency\r\nincreased with time may be assumed from the case, in 1721, of Fray\r\nFrancisco Diego de Zarate, President of the Mission of Santa María de\r\nlos Angeles of Rio Blanca, a Franciscan entrusted with many important\r\npositions. The summary in his trial states that the evidence collected\r\nproved a hundred and twenty-six acts of solicitation with fifty-six\r\nwomen and that it was his habit to solicit every one who came to him to\r\nconfess. It is impossible to conceive anything more brutal than some of\r\nthe details of the evidence; the offence in many cases was almost public\r\nand might have continued indefinitely had he not banished from Rio\r\nBlanco a woman and her family because she resisted him, whereupon she\r\ntalked and created a scandal that rendered action necessary. Of the\r\nwomen, twenty-one were Indians, eight were Spaniards (one of them his\r\nnear relative), eight Mulattos, four Mestizos and fifteen whose race is\r\nnot specified. When the accusation, detailing all the cases, was read to\r\nhim, he admitted its correctness and indeed he had previously made a\r\nwritten confession which contained a large number that had escaped the\r\ninvestigations of the prosecution. Aggravated as was this case Fray\r\nFrancisco escaped with a second reading of his sentence in the\r\nFranciscan convent, where a circular discipline was administered,\r\nperpetual deprivation of confessing and of active and passive voice in\r\nhis Order, six months’ suspension from celebrating mass and two years’\r\nreclusion in a convent, of which the first was to be passed in a cell\r\nwith fasting on bread and water on Fridays and Saturdays, and the last\r\nplace in choir and refectory.[479] Yet inadequate as was the habitual\r\ntreatment of the offence by the Inquisition, it was regarded as unduly\r\nharsh by the clerical authorities. The inquisitors, in a letter of 1666\r\nto the Suprema, by way of illustrating the prevalent laxity of the\r\nReligious Orders, mention that after they had penanced four frailes for\r\nsolicitation, they were applied to to remove the restrictions which\r\nprevented the culprits from being promoted to prelacies.[480]\r\nSelf-denunciation, as in Spain, was tolerably certain to win virtual\r\nimmunity. In 1712, Luis Marin, vicar of Nativitas, accused himself by\r\nletter, to which the tribunal promptly responded by summoning him to\r\nappear within thirty days, but that only a reprimand was intended is\r\nevident from the summons being accompanied with a faculty to absolve him\r\nfrom the excommunication incurred, sent to Padre Fernández de Córdova,\r\nS. J., who was instructed to counsel him to abstain for the present from\r\nconfessing women.[481]\r\n\r\nThe very miscellaneous functions assumed by the Inquisition in extending\r\nits jurisdiction over a variety of matters foreign to its original\r\npurpose is illustrated by a fortuitous collection of 397 cases between\r\nits commencement in 1572 and the year 1800. In these the offences\r\nalleged are[482]--\r\n\r\nBigamy                             76\r\nJudaism                            71\r\nOffences against the Inquisition   49\r\nSolicitation                       44\r\nBlasphemy                          39\r\nSorcery and superstitions          29\r\nHeresy                             20\r\nPropositions                       13\r\nIlluminism                         12\r\nFalse witness                      10\r\nPersonating priesthood              7\r\nMiscellaneous                      27\r\n\r\nThe considerable proportion of offences against the Inquisition arose\r\nfrom the perpetual troubles caused by what was known as its temporal\r\njurisdiction, apart from its spiritual sphere of action. Every one\r\nconnected with it in an official capacity, however insignificant, with\r\nhis family, servants and slaves, was entitled, in a greater or less\r\ndegree, to the _fuero_, or jurisdiction of the Holy Office, and to\r\nexemption from pleading or prosecution in the secular court if a layman,\r\nor the episcopal court if an ecclesiastic. As favoritism rendered this\r\nprivilege virtually an immunity for crime it was eagerly sought and, as\r\nit was the source of influence and of profitable business, the tribunal\r\nendeavored to extend its jurisdiction in every way, with little regard\r\nto the limits imposed by law. This led to constant conflicts between the\r\nrival jurisdictions, in which the tribunal used without scruple its\r\nfaculties of excommunication and of treating any opposition as an\r\nattempt to impede its freedom of action, a crime to be prosecuted and\r\nseverely punished. In Spain these irreconcilable pretensions were the\r\ncause of constant troubles, the settlement of which was through the\r\nprocess known as _competencia_, carrying them up to the Supreme Council\r\nof the Inquisition on the one hand and to the Council of Castile or of\r\nAragon on the other, with the monarch as the final arbiter. In the\r\nColonies, however, as we shall see, this system was practically eluded,\r\nand the tribunals became even more arbitrarily lawless than those of the\r\nhome country, sometimes abusing their power after a fashion that\r\ninvolved the whole land in confusion, for in matters of faith they had\r\nno superior, short of the inquisitor-general, and it rested with\r\nthemselves to define what was, directly or indirectly, a matter of\r\nfaith.\r\n\r\nThere were two classes of officials whose claims to the _fuero_\r\nwere different. Those known as _titulados y asalariados_ were\r\ndirectly employed in the tribunal, holding commissions from the\r\ninquisitor-general, enjoying salaries and understood to devote\r\nthemselves exclusively to its service. For them and their families and\r\ndependants the fuero was complete, in both civil and criminal matters,\r\nand both active and passive--that is, whether as plaintiff or defendant.\r\nThey were comparatively few in number, their position was unchallenged\r\nand, whatever may have been the injustice and oppression thence arising,\r\nthere was little occasion for dispute. Beyond these were the unsalaried\r\nofficials--commissioners and their notaries and alguazils, stationed at\r\nall important centres, consultors, _calificadores_ or censors and, above\r\nall, familiars numerously scattered throughout the land. All these\r\npursued their regular avocations and only acted when called on for\r\nspecial service; they received no salary, but the positions were eagerly\r\nsought, chiefly on account of the privileges and immunities which they\r\nconferred. Of these the familiars were by far the most numerous and\r\ntroublesome. In Spain the definition of their privileges had been the\r\nsubject of numerous settlements known as Concordias and, when Philip II\r\nestablished the colonial tribunals, he endeavored to forestall trouble\r\nby extending to them the Castilian Concordia of 1553, which was much\r\nless favorable to the familiars than those of the kingdoms of Aragon\r\nand, at the same time, he sought to limit the number of appointees.\r\n\r\nAmong the documents issued in 1570 is a cédula addressed to the colonial\r\nauthorities, in which Philip conveys to them the regulations adopted by\r\nthe inquisitor-general. In the city of Mexico there are allowed twelve\r\nfamiliars, in the cathedral towns four, in other towns one. Lists of\r\nthese and of all changes are to be furnished to the local magistracy, so\r\nthat they may see that the number is not exceeded and, in case of\r\nimproper appointments, they are to report to the tribunal or, if\r\nnecessary, to the inquisitor-general. In civil suits the familiars are\r\nnot entitled to the fuero, whether as plaintiffs or defendants. In\r\ncriminal matters not as plaintiffs while, as defendants, they are to\r\nenjoy it except in cases of treason, unnatural crime, raising popular\r\ncommotions, forging letters of safe-conduct, resistance to royal\r\ncommands, abduction or violation of women, highway robbery, house or\r\nchurch breaking, arson of houses or harvests and “other crimes greater\r\nthan these” and also in resistance or disrespect to the royal judges.\r\nExcepted also is official malfeasance in those holding public office.\r\nArrest by secular judges is permitted, in cases entitled to the fuero,\r\nprovided the culprit is handed over to the Inquisition, together with\r\nthe evidence, which is to be at his expense. If the offence is committed\r\noutside of the city of Mexico, the offender cannot return to his place\r\nof residence without exhibiting a copy of the inquisitorial sentence,\r\nwith evidence of its fulfilment. By a cédula of May 13, 1572, moreover,\r\noffences committed against Indians were added to the excepted\r\ncases.[483]\r\n\r\nThis all appears definite enough, but it was easily evaded. At first\r\nthere seems to have been a disposition to conform to its intent. In\r\n1575 a familiar named Rodrigo de Yepes, who had given the lie to, and\r\nrepeatedly struck in the face, the alcalde of Valladola, was arrested by\r\nthe civil magistrate and claimed by the tribunal but, after a\r\ncompetencia, or discussion of the case by the civil and inquisitorial\r\nauthorities, the latter admitted that it was excepted and surrendered\r\nhim. On the other hand, in 1615, Diego de Carmona Jamariz, a familiar of\r\nPuebla, was arrested for the murder of his enemy, Joan de Olivárez, and\r\nwas surrendered to the Inquisition without a competencia, although\r\nmurder would seem to be a greater crime than highway robbery or\r\nburglary. The widow prosecuted him before the tribunal, but it was\r\nuseless and the case was dropped. In Spain, the Inquisition had devised\r\nthe ingenious argument that, until a crime was proved, it could not be\r\nclassed as excepted and therefore the affair was under its jurisdiction\r\nuntil conviction, which enabled it to protect its familiars, and this\r\nplea was used, in 1616, in the case of Gonzalo Antúnez Yáñez, a\r\nfamiliar, prosecuted by order of the viceroy.[484]\r\n\r\nIt was not only the familiars who gave trouble, but the numerous other\r\nunsalaried officials. The commissioners with their notaries and\r\nalguazils formed little groups in the provincial towns, of which the\r\nmembers supported each other and set the magistrates and courts at\r\ndefiance. In the original instructions issued to the inquisitors they\r\nwere admonished to be careful in the selection of commissioners, who\r\nwere not to interfere with the constituted authorities or to provoke\r\nquarrels, but were merely to execute the mandates of the tribunal and to\r\nreport on such matters as should present themselves.[485] Distance and\r\nthe difficulty of communication, however, rendered them prone to abuse\r\ntheir position, and in this they were emboldened by the unwavering\r\nsupport of the tribunal. Throughout all the Spanish Colonies the\r\ncommissioner was an object of dread and the subject of perpetual\r\ncomplaint on the part of the secular and ecclesiastical powers. The\r\ngeneral sentiment is expressed, as late as 1777, by Santiago Joseph,\r\nBishop of Cuba, in a letter to Inquisitor-general Bertran. All the\r\ncommissioners whom he had known, he said, had been ignorant persons,\r\nwith the exception of one whose term of service was brief. There was no\r\nsalary to attract competent men and the place was taken only to serve as\r\nan excuse for neglecting all clerical functions and duties. The commerce\r\nof Havana brought numerous heretics who scattered their poison and he\r\ndared not interpose for fear of the consequences of invading\r\ninquisitorial jurisdiction. The existing incumbent paid no attention to\r\nthis and, when not absent, was wholly occupied in stirring up quarrels\r\nwith the civil authorities.[486]\r\n\r\nThe commissioners of Mexico fully justified this characterization by the\r\ngood bishop. In the great majority of cases the hopelessness of\r\nresistance to their arbitrary acts caused submission, but occasionally\r\none emerges to light which illustrates the spirit animating the\r\nInquisition and its officials. In 1699, Father Pistoya, S. J., the\r\necclesiastical judge of Sinaloa, prosecuted Martin de Verastegui for\r\nincestuous adultery with Maria García. Thereupon his intimate friend,\r\nPérez de Ribera, the commissioner, to protect him, promptly appointed\r\nhim notary, an act for which he had no authority. Pistoya sent the\r\nevidence in the case to the royal court of Guadalajara (Jalisco), which\r\nordered the Governor of Sinaloa, Don Jacinto de Fuensaldaña, to arrest\r\nthe guilty pair, embargo their property and send them to the royal\r\nprison of Guadalajara. Ribera claimed him as an official of the\r\nInquisition and, on refusal, excommunicated the governor and the\r\nmilitary officers who had executed his orders and posted them as such on\r\nthe tablillas of the church. The tribunal sustained its commissioner;\r\nthe governor was obliged to appear before it and beg for absolution; the\r\ncommissioner was empowered to take testimony in the case and report it\r\nto the tribunal, which naturally found the parties innocent and\r\nVerastegui was rewarded with a genuine notary’s commission in lieu of\r\nthe fictitious one which had protected him from justice. It is no wonder\r\nthat, in replying to their report of another outrageous case in 1695,\r\nthe Suprema had sharply rebuked the inquisitors, ordering them to act\r\nwith justice and moderation and prevent the complaints of their\r\nproceedings, which came daily to the king from the Council of Indies,\r\nbut the case of Verastegui shows how little respect they paid to the\r\nadmonition.[487]\r\n\r\nYet, with all this, there were comparatively few of the bitter\r\nstruggles, so frequent in Spain during this period, between the royal\r\nand inquisitorial jurisdictions. It was not that the inquisitors were\r\nless arbitrary and audacious than at home, for their distance from the\r\ncourt rendered them even more independent, but that the secular\r\nmagistracy felt its weakness and offered less resolute resistance. Spain\r\nwas far off and the viceroy, though representing the royal autocracy,\r\nwas under strict orders to show every favor to the Inquisition. There\r\nwas kept in the royal chancellery the formula of a letter to all\r\nviceroys, emphasizing the great services of the Inquisition to religion\r\nand to the king and ordering it to be favored and guarded in all its\r\nprivileges, exemptions and liberties, including those of its officials\r\nand familiars. Adherence to this would be regarded as most acceptable\r\nservice and the contrary would not be permitted.[488] This portentous\r\ndocument was sent to the Viceroys of Mexico and Peru in 1603 and was\r\ndoubtless repeated to them whenever necessary, as it was to other royal\r\nrepresentatives at subsequent periods. As a rule however the viceroys\r\nand the tribunal were at odds and their quarrels were not conducive to\r\npopular tranquillity or edification. More than once we find viceroys\r\nlike Mancera, Cerralbo and Gelvez threatening the inquisitors with\r\nbanishment.[489]\r\n\r\nAs a matter of course, under such auspices, colonial inquisitors could\r\nnever be restrained within the limit of their rightful prerogatives,\r\ngreat as these were. A royal cédula of January 20, 1587, scolds those of\r\nLima for illegal protection of their familiars and for vexing the local\r\nmagistrates by summoning them from long distances before the tribunal.\r\nAnother of March 8, 1589, rebukes them for creating too many familiars\r\nand other officials. Another of August 23, 1595, reprimands those of\r\nMexico for supporting a familiar in refusing to render an account to the\r\nroyal chancery of his functions as custom-house officer at Vera\r\nCruz.[490] These complaints were of almost daily occurrence until at\r\nlength Philip III sought to cut them off at the root by forming a junta\r\nof two members from each of the Councils of the Inquisition and of\r\nIndies to advise him. After mature deliberation they did so and the\r\nresult is what is known as the Concordia of 1610. The prohibitions\r\nembodied in this are eloquent of the audacity of the inquisitors in\r\nexceeding their functions, abusing their authority in matters wholly\r\noutside of their jurisdiction and exercising an insufferably vexatious\r\npetty tyranny, the exasperating effect of which was intensified by the\r\nimmunity enjoyed by the servants and slaves of the officials. These were\r\njusticiable only by the tribunal, which invariably protected them, so\r\nthat the community was exposed without redress to the insolence of a\r\nclass peculiarly apt to abuse its privileges.\r\n\r\nUnder pain of forfeiture of office the inquisitors were forbidden,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, by themselves or their kindred, to farm the\r\npublic revenues or to prevent their being farmed to the highest bidder.\r\nNeither they nor the salaried officials were to engage in any kind of\r\ntrade, under the same penalty. They were not to claim the right of\r\nseizing articles at an appraised price, except under urgent necessity\r\nfor the support of the prisoners or buildings of the Inquisition. Their\r\nnegroes were not to carry arms except when accompanying their masters.\r\nThey were not to defend commissioners or familiars in frauds on the\r\nrevenue nor in refusing to render an account of deposits made with them\r\nby order of court. They were not to detain the couriers and messengers\r\nwho served as a rudimentary post-office and were to remove the\r\nprohibition against vessels leaving port or passengers departing without\r\ntheir licence. They were not to arrest the royal alguazils except for\r\ngrave and notorious excess against the Inquisition. They were to be\r\nallowed one alguazil in Vera Cruz and were to dismiss all those\r\nappointed elsewhere.[491] They were not to protect familiars, who held\r\npublic office, when prosecuted for official malfeasance, nor\r\ncommissioners who held benefices for offences committed in their\r\ncharacter of incumbents. They were not to order universities to grant\r\ndegrees in contravention of their statutes, nor were they to interfere\r\nin matters of government apart from their functions. They were not to\r\nexcommunicate a viceroy in cases of competencia, nor was the viceroy to\r\nevoke to himself a case that might lead to a competencia. A provision\r\nwas also made for the settlement of competencias without the tedious\r\nresort to the councils in Spain. If the senior judge and senior\r\ninquisitor could not agree in their conference, the inquisitors were to\r\nname three ecclesiastical dignitaries to the viceroy, who was to select\r\none; he was to be adjoined to the judge and inquisitor and the majority\r\nwas to decide or, if there were three discordant opinions, the viceroy\r\nwas to choose between them.[492]\r\n\r\nThis project for the settlement of competencias was ineffective. A\r\ncédula of February 7, 1569, had extended to the colonies the system in\r\nforce at home, and under it there had been in Mexico, during the\r\nremainder of the century, seven cases; there was one in 1601 and another\r\nin 1602, after which they ceased.[493] Solorzano tells us that they were\r\nnot revived by the new regulations, which omitted to specify the place\r\nwhere the conferences were to be held, and the judges and inquisitors\r\neach summoned the others to come to them. The judges had old custom and\r\nroyal cédulas on their side, but the inquisitors refused compliance\r\nbecause the orders had not been transmitted to them through the Suprema\r\nwhich they claimed was requisite to their validity, and thus important\r\ncases, both civil and criminal, remained undecided, to the great injury\r\nof individuals and the public. Moved by the complaints thus occasioned,\r\nPhilip III, in a cédula of November 19, 1618, ordered that the\r\nconferences be held in the vice-regal palace, where the senior judge was\r\nto have precedence over the inquisitor, and this was repeated in a\r\ncédula to the court of Lima, May 28, 1621, but again the inquisitors of\r\nboth Mexico and Peru refused obedience on the same pretext as before.\r\nThus cases continued undecided until the urgency of the Council of\r\nIndies led Philip IV to consult both councils and, in 1636, he ordered\r\nthat the judge and inquisitor should meet before the viceroy, the one\r\nwho was senior in office taking the right hand.[494] This compromise did\r\nnot suit the pretensions of the Holy Office for precedence and it gained\r\nthe victory in a cédula of May 30, 1640, which recites that, after many\r\nconferences, it was determined that the senior judge must go to the\r\nInquisition, where the senior inquisitor was to have precedence, when\r\nthe competencia was to be settled under the provisions of the Concordia\r\nof 1610.[495] Apparently this assumption of their inferiority was\r\ninsufferable to the judges, for no formal competencia occurred between\r\n1602 and 1711. Matters in dispute were occasionally referred to the\r\ncouncils in Spain, but this was of little benefit for it was usually\r\nthe last heard of the case.[496] To appreciate fully the cruelty of all\r\nthis, we must reflect that perhaps some accused person or unlucky\r\nalguazil, arrested for executing the orders of his superiors, might be\r\nlanguishing in gaol for a life-time, awaiting the settlement of a\r\nconflict of jurisdiction which could never be settled.\r\n\r\nWhether or not the other prescriptions of the Concordia of 1610 were\r\nbetter observed than those concerning competencias it would be difficult\r\nto determine, but the presumption is adverse. At all events,\r\ninquisitorial ingenuity was constantly devising new methods of\r\naggression and further complaints led Philip IV to assemble a junta of\r\ntwo members of each council, whose conferences resulted in the enactment\r\nof another Concordia, published April 11, 1633. Many of its clauses\r\nrelate to the ever-present question of precedence, which need not detain\r\nus here, except the suggestive one that, at bull-fights in the plaza,\r\nthe first courses are to be performed before the secular authorities,\r\nunless the latter, of their own accord, desire that honor to be paid to\r\nthe inquisitors. Equally suggestive in another way are the prescriptions\r\nthat commissioners shall treat the public courteously and that\r\ninquisitors shall treat the judges with respect and shall cease\r\nmolesting the officers of the royal courts with censures and summoning\r\nand detaining them. They are again forbidden to engage in trade and are\r\ntold not to interfere with the elections of secular officials nor, in\r\ntimes of scarcity, are they to persecute with excommunications the\r\nguards in charge of boats bringing grain, but are to apply to the\r\nviceroy, who will promptly supply their wants. The prohibition of\r\ndetaining ships is repeated, but they are allowed to grant licences for\r\nsailing and for individuals to depart, which practically amounted to the\r\nsame thing. The inquisitors seem to have gained their point as to the\r\nright of seizing goods and materials at a “just price,” for this is\r\nallowed, subject to some limitations. The inviolability of the domicile\r\nof inquisitors is admitted in the provision that it is not to be abused\r\nby secreting goods to the prejudice of third parties; and, in the case\r\nof salaried officials, it is limited by a clause that when it is\r\nnecessary for officers of justice to enter the house of such official,\r\nor of the widow of one during her widowhood, notice shall first be given\r\nto the tribunal, which shall appoint one of its ministers to be present,\r\nwith an appointee of the viceroy or court and, if such an appointment is\r\nnot made within two or three hours, the entry can be made without longer\r\nwaiting. One of the petty privileges which gave rise to constant\r\nexacerbation is indicated in the provision that, of the cattle\r\nslaughtered in the public shambles, there shall be given weekly the\r\nchine and chitterlings of ten oxen--two to each of the inquisitors, one\r\nto the alguazil and secretaries, one to the receiver and notary of\r\nsequestrations, and the rest to the poor prisoners; this is said to be\r\nall that the tribunal is entitled to and anything more must be paid for,\r\nnor shall its servants take the chitterlings and sell them.[497]\r\n\r\nConcordias were only attempts to restrain existing abuses and they could\r\nnot provide for the perpetual new aggressions suggested by the facile\r\nweapon of excommunication through which the Inquisition could overcome\r\nthe resistance of the secular authorities. The distribution of\r\nquicksilver, for instance, to the miners was a matter jealously reserved\r\nto the viceroy and the junta of the treasury but, when the Inquisition\r\nwanted it for some mines belonging to it in Zacatecas, it forced, by\r\nthreats of excommunication, the royal officials to supply its demands.\r\nViceroy Mancera, in a letter of December 8, 1666, complains of this and\r\nof a case in which the royal treasurer of Guadalajara owed a personal\r\ndebt to the tribunal of 980 pesos and the commissioner there, by order\r\nof the acting inquisitor and visitador, Medina Rico, forced the auditor\r\nof the treasury to pay it out of the royal funds, by threats of\r\nexcommunication and of a fine of 500 pesos. Mancera endeavored by\r\ncourteous remonstrance to obtain restitution but, after the inquisitors\r\nhad insulted him, he only succeeded in getting 600 pesos returned. In\r\nreporting these matters to the king, the Council of Indies pointed out\r\nforcibly how incompatible with subordination and good government were\r\nthese arbitrary extensions of inquisitorial jurisdiction over matters\r\nwholly foreign to the objects of its institution.[498]\r\n\r\nIndeed, the existence of so uncontrollable and disturbing an element\r\ngoes far to explain the ill-success of Spanish colonial administration.\r\nIn 1615, Fray Isidro Ordoñez, commissioner in San Francisco del Nuevo\r\nMexico, under pretext of a fictitious order from the tribunal, gathered\r\na band of soldiers and citizens, to whom inquisitorial orders were\r\nsupreme, and seized Don Pedro de Peralta, Governor of New Mexico, and\r\nheld him in irons for nine months. Peralta managed to complain to the\r\ntribunal, which summoned Ordoñez to the capital and assigned to him his\r\nconvent for a prison, but Peralta obtained no satisfaction beyond a\r\ndeclaration that there had been no cause for his arrest, while Ordoñez,\r\nin place of the severe punishment which he merited, was permitted to\r\nattend the general chapter of his Order in Rome, as procurator of the\r\nprovince of Mexico.[499] Another Governor of New Mexico, Diego de\r\nPeñalosa, fared even worse when, for indiscreet words about priests and\r\ninquisitors and expressions verging on blasphemy, he was exposed to the\r\nhumiliation of appearing as a penitent in the auto de fe of February 3,\r\n1668--thus virtually incapacitating him for further service.[500] It was\r\nnot without grounds that the Council of Indies, in 1696, addressed a\r\nformal remonstrance to Carlos II, recapitulating a long array of abuses\r\nand violences, showing the impossibility of enforcing observance of the\r\nConcordias or obedience to the royal commands. Prelates and governors\r\nwere alike sufferers from the irrepressible audacity which admitted no\r\nresponsibility to any one, so long as it was upheld and justified by the\r\nSuprema at home, and the council supplicated the king, if not for the\r\ntotal extinction of the tribunal, at least for the dismissal of the\r\nofficials. Without some thorough change the retention of the colonies\r\ncould scarce be hoped for, as all the population was inspired with a\r\ncommon hatred arising from its violence.[501]\r\n\r\nAs the council says, prelates were as liable as royal officials to be\r\nsubjected to the lawless action of the tribunal. There never were\r\nlacking pretexts for quarrel. In 1617 Archbishop Pedro de Villareal\r\nfared badly in a rupture caused by his inserting in an edict some\r\nmatters which the tribunal claimed to belong to its jurisdiction. In\r\n1623 Bishop Bohorques of Oaxaca had the same experience because he\r\nstyled himself Inquisidor Ordinario. The episcopate of Archbishop Matheo\r\nSagade Bugueiro, from 1655 to 1662, was a succession of bitter\r\ndissensions, during which Bernardino de Amezaga, chief notary of the\r\ncourt of testaments, was arrested by the tribunal, deprived of his\r\noffice and banished, while Francisco de Bermeo, contador of the Santa\r\nCruzada, was kept long in prison, fined 200 pesos and a negro slave of\r\nhis was sold to defray it. In 1658 the archbishop made a demand that all\r\nedicts read in his cathedral must first be shown to him in order to\r\nsatisfy him that they contained nothing that invaded his jurisdiction,\r\nand his action in enforcing this claim led the tribunal to publish a\r\nmanifesto declaring that, under the bull _Si de protegendis_, he had\r\nincurred degradation and relaxation to the secular arm.[502]\r\n\r\nThere was one case, however, in which the tribunal and the Archbishop of\r\nMexico combined for the persecution of a bishop, for Juan de Mañozca,\r\nthe archbishop from 1643 to 1653, was cousin of the inquisitor of the\r\nsame name. The saintly Bishop Juan de Palafox of Puebla, in his capacity\r\nof visitador and protector of the Indians, incurred the enmity of the\r\narchbishop and of the Viceroy Salvatierra, and an occasion of gratifying\r\nit occurred when he undertook to guard his episcopal jurisdiction\r\nagainst the encroachments of the Jesuits. They appointed _jueces\r\nconservadores_ to protect their interests and the tribunal rushed\r\neagerly into the fray, with which it had absolutely no right to\r\nintervene.[503] It ordered the suppression of the writings and edicts of\r\nPalafox and forbade any interference with those of the conservators; it\r\nsent a commissioner to Puebla who terrorized the community by arresting\r\nprominent priests and citizens of the bishop’s party, parading them\r\nthrough the streets in chains and sending them to Mexico, where they\r\nwere thrown into the secret prison, thus inflicting indelible disgrace\r\non them and their posterity. In spite of the exemption of Indians from\r\ninquisitorial jurisdiction, he flogged nearly to death, with four\r\nhundred lashes, an unfortunate Indian who, at the command of a citizen,\r\nhad taken down one of the conservators’ edicts. Palafox was advised that\r\nhe too would be arrested and fled to the mountains, where he lay\r\nconcealed for several months.[504] When, in 1647, he appealed to the\r\nSuprema, powers were sent to the Bishop of Oaxaca to investigate and\r\nreport, but Archbishop Mañozca threw every impediment in his way and, in\r\nhis capacity of visitador of the Inquisition, assumed to annul his\r\ncommission. He appealed to the Bishop of Yucatan, then Governor of New\r\nSpain, and to the Audiencia for support, but the archbishop threatened\r\nto excommunicate them all and they prudently declined the conflict.\r\nPalafox represents to the Suprema that his life was in danger and he\r\nbegs to be allowed to return to Spain.[505] The combination of the\r\narchbishopric and Inquisition, under the two Mañozcas, evidently held\r\nthe whole land in its grasp, and no one was hardy enough to oppose it.\r\nPalafox was obliged to abandon Mexico, but he eventually secured a\r\ndecision in his favor on an appeal to Rome.\r\n\r\nAn episode of this case is worth recounting in some detail, not only as\r\nillustrating inquisitorial methods but as a rare instance of a victim\r\nobtaining a measure of satisfaction. Doctor Juan de la Camara, a canon\r\nof the cathedral, was a man of noble birth, proud of his unblemished\r\n_limpieza_, and his appointment as visitador of the see of Guadalajara\r\nindicates the estimation in which he was held by his superiors.\r\nUnfortunately he was a friend and correspondent of Palafox. When, in\r\n1646, a bitter libel was circulated against the latter, one of the\r\njudges of the Audiencia, Alonso González de Villalba, was included in\r\nit. Palafox endured the attack in silence and endeavored to make\r\nVillalba follow his example, but the latter was so incensed that he\r\nwrote a reply in which he handled roughly the inquisitor Mañozca. He\r\nshowed it to his neighbor Camara, who returned it without comment and\r\nsaid nothing about it except to Don Antonio Urrutía de Vergara, to whom\r\nhe mentioned it in order that he might tell the archbishop, and to a\r\nDoña Catalina de Diosdado, to whom he merely said that he had seen two\r\nscandalous papers and that, if the author confessed to him, he would not\r\nabsolve him.\r\n\r\nThere was a chance that among his papers something might be found to\r\ncompromise Palafox, so an order of arrest with sequestration of property\r\nwas made out, February 7, 1647. At eight o’clock in the morning Camara\r\nwas roused from his bed and taken in his own carriage to the secret\r\nprison, where he was confined in a cell of which the window had been\r\nblocked up, so that the single candle to which he was restricted was his\r\nonly light by day and night. Here he was kept _incomunicado_ for twenty\r\ndays. After the tenth day, however, on which he was examined, the\r\nobstructions were removed from the window and, after the twentieth, his\r\nbrother, Fray Diego, and some other friends were permitted to see him on\r\nobtaining a special licence for each visit. Meanwhile his papers had\r\nbeen carried off to the tribunal, without being inventoried as required\r\nby the Instructions; on the day after his arrest his household effects\r\nwere inventoried and placed in the hands of the receiver, Juan González\r\nde Castro, as depository, but they were not removed from the house and\r\nno care was taken to ensure their safety.\r\n\r\nAt nightfall of March 15th he was taken back to his house and told that\r\nit was henceforth to be his prison, under pain of excommunication and a\r\nthousand ducats. On April 1st his prison was enlarged to the city, under\r\nthe same penalties, and he was enabled to resume his duties at the\r\ncathedral. Of course the immurement in the secret prison, with\r\nsequestration of property, of so prominent an ecclesiastic, caused a\r\ngeneral sensation; it was at the height of the prosecution of the\r\nJudaizers and the inevitable conclusion was that they had implicated\r\nhim, so that a stain was cast upon his honor which no subsequent\r\nexculpation could wholly efface. His papers were withheld from him; his\r\nhouse had been richly furnished, with abundance of silver plate and\r\nlinen, much of which had disappeared, and he seems to have deplored\r\nespecially the loss of eighteen ounces of amber. His trial remained\r\nunconcluded and his repeated applications for a decision and for the\r\nrestoration of missing property were filed away without action. His only\r\nhope of escape from prolonged and intolerable suspense lay in appealing\r\nto the Suprema. The inquisitors had already sought to prejudice it\r\nagainst him for, in a letter of May 20th, they spoke of the incredible\r\nefforts and diabolical means employed to intimidate them from the\r\nperformance of their duty in the matter of Palafox; Camara was an\r\naccomplice of Villalba in publishing the libel; he had perjured himself\r\nin his confessions and might be assumed to be the author of the worst\r\npassages in it. In spite of this the Suprema, by a decree of September\r\n28, 1647, ordered his release, on the security of his oath, and the\r\nsequestration of his property to be removed.\r\n\r\nCamara succeeded in secretly obtaining from the king an order, November\r\n16, 1647, permitting him to go to Spain, but he was impoverished and\r\nsent his brother, Fray Diego, to act for him. The mission occupied Diego\r\nfor several years, but he finally procured from the Suprema a commission\r\nto the Inquisitor Higuera to try the case promptly for, during all this\r\ntime, it had been held suspended over Camara’s head. This was presented,\r\nFebruary 15, 1650, and, on the following July 12th, Higuera, who was at\r\nodds with Mañozca, rendered a sentence acquitting him and restoring him\r\nto his previous good fame, so that his arrest should work no prejudice\r\nto him or to his kindred and their descendants; also that the chapter\r\nshould pay him all the accrued fruits of his prebend and that his papers\r\nand property should be returned to him. From this Camara appealed to the\r\nSuprema, which confirmed it, July 7, 1651; then the fiscal of the\r\nSuprema appealed and it was again confirmed, July 31st. The whole\r\nprosecution was thus stamped as being malicious and groundless, but\r\nnevertheless Camara in vain endeavored to regain possession of his\r\npapers and of his missing effects.\r\n\r\nArchbishop Mañozca died in 1653; the affair of Palafox had created no\r\nlittle scandal in Spain and, in 1654, a new visitador, Pedro de Medina\r\nRico, was sent out with instructions especially to investigate it.\r\nCamara promptly set forth his grievances, in September, in a complaint\r\nagainst Estrada and Higuera--for apparently Mañozca, as the subject of\r\nthe libel, had not sat in the trial. On December 1st he made his formal\r\ncharges in a criminal action against them, laying his damages at 12,000\r\npesos, which he claimed to be the amount which the affair had cost him\r\nin losses and expenses. It was a bold undertaking and probably\r\nunexampled, and he found it impossible to secure the necessary legal\r\nassistance for, on January 20, 1655, he represented that none of the\r\nprocurators of the Audiencia would serve him, wherefore he prayed for an\r\norder on Juan de Escobar to appear for him. It was granted and enforced\r\nwith a penalty of fifty pesos, under pressure of which Escobar took\r\ncharge of the case. In the same way his witnesses refused to appear\r\nuntil he procured orders on them, with censures for disobedience. The\r\naction went slowly on through its various stages; the inquisitors made\r\nno effort to justify what they had done and confined their defence to\r\nalleging that the affair was a _cosa juzgada_, which could not be\r\nreopened, and to interjecting appeals to the Suprema at every adverse\r\ninterlocutory decree. It was not until May 31, 1656, that Medina Rico\r\npronounced sentence to the effect that Camara had proved his case\r\ncompletely and that Estrada and Higuera had alleged nothing to palliate\r\ntheir grave offence, the punishment of which he reserved for future\r\ndecision. As to what affected the interest of the plaintiff, he\r\ncondemned them jointly and severally to pay him two thousand pesos. The\r\nreceiver, or depository, was ordered to restore to him everything shown\r\nin the inventory and, if it appeared that articles were not deposited\r\nwith him, the inquisitors must make them good under penalty of a\r\nthousand pesos. From this the inquisitors appealed and, after protracted\r\nargument, Rico suspended the order to pay the two thousand pesos until\r\nthe Suprema should decide the appeal, but that the rest of the sentence\r\nshould be executed without awaiting its action. Then followed a long and\r\nconfused litigation with the executor of the receiver de Castro, who had\r\nbeen dead for many years and his estate distributed. The documents\r\npreserved end with November 14, 1657, at which time they were made up\r\nfor transmission to the Suprema and what was its final decision cannot\r\nbe told.[506] It is evident that Camara obtained little compensation for\r\nhis sufferings, but at least he had the satisfaction of seeing his\r\npersecutors punished, although inadequately, for official offenders were\r\nalways treated tenderly by the Inquisition. Medina Rico, as the result\r\nof his visitation, formulated hundreds of charges against them,\r\ncollectively and individually, and rendered sentence, May 17, 1662, in\r\nthe audience-chamber, where all the officials were assembled. Estrada\r\nwas condemned to severe reprimand, to a fine of 1500 pesos and to four\r\nyears’ suspension, though, as he had died October 26, 1661, the penalty\r\nfell only on his heirs. Higuera was sentenced to a fine of a hundred\r\npesos and two years’ suspension, which he endured until May 16, 1664.\r\nMañozca was visited more heavily with a fine of 1300 pesos and nine\r\nyears of suspension.[507] This he could afford to disregard for, in the\r\nautumn of 1661, he had been provided with the bishopric of Santiago de\r\nCuba whence, in 1666, he was transferred to that of Guatemala and\r\nfinally, in 1675, he obtained the wealthy see of Puebla, from which he\r\nhad driven Palafox. Retributive justice, however, at last overtook him,\r\nfor he died before he could take possession.[508] Such were the men who\r\nlargely filled the tribunals and episcopates of the Colonies.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the privileges claimed by the Inquisition was exemption from\r\nmilitary service. This was strictly limited by the Concordia of 1633.\r\nOfficials holding commissions from the inquisitor-general were exempted\r\nfrom appearing in the general musters, but familiars were not, unless\r\nactually on duty for the tribunal and, if the enemy was in sight, all\r\nwere liable to service, save those necessary to guard the papers and\r\nrecords of the tribunal, to whom certificates were to be given. As might\r\nbe expected, however, little respect was paid to these provisions. In\r\n1685, the alcalde of Puebla called a muster of the citizens to march to\r\nthe succor of Campeachy. Hipolito del Castillo, alguazil and familiar,\r\nclaimed exemption, to which he was clearly not entitled. The alcalde\r\nthreatened to send him on a mule to Campeachy and in effect threw him\r\ninto prison, placed his head in the pillory and made him pay a fine of\r\n120 pesos. The commissioner at Puebla defended Castillo and, on appeal\r\nto the Inquisition, it ordered the money to be returned. Again, in 1718,\r\nwhen eight companies of merchants were formed in Puebla, by order of the\r\nviceroy, to make the rounds of the city and drive out malefactors,\r\nMartínez de Castro, a familiar and trader, was enrolled; he protested\r\nand appealed to the Inquisition, which ordered his discharge, in which\r\nthe authorities immediately acquiesced.[509]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe inquisitorial function of censorship was by no means neglected. Even\r\nbefore the establishment of the tribunal, it was felt necessary to guard\r\nthe faithful from the infection of heretical books and, in 1561,\r\nInquisitor-general Valdés sent to Archbishop Montufar a commission\r\nempowering him to examine the book-shops for that purpose.[510] This\r\nconveyed no censorial power, but Páramo proudly asserts that, almost at\r\nthe inception of the Holy Office, calificadores were appointed who\r\nexercised a most vigilant supervision over all books introduced into the\r\ncolony, even over those which had passed the examination of the Suprema\r\nitself, and who occasionally had the satisfaction of showing that books\r\nwidely circulated in Spain required expurgation. In fact, a letter of\r\nthe Suprema respecting the Index then in preparation shows that, as\r\nearly as 1573, censures of books were received from Mexico. The position\r\nof calificador, like that of inquisitor, seems to have been a\r\nstepping-stone to the bishop’s chair, for the first one was Domingo de\r\nSalazar, promoted, in 1581, to the archiepiscopate of the Philippines;\r\nthe second was Bartolomé de Ledesma, who in 1581 became Bishop of\r\nOaxaca, and the third was Pedro de Ribera, who in 1594 was elected\r\nBishop of Panama, but died on the road to take possession.[511]\r\nApparently the office was one not always easy to fill. In a letter of\r\nSeptember 1, 1655, the tribunal informed the Suprema that it was in need\r\nof correctors of books and calificadores and it sent the genealogy of\r\nPadre Juan Hortiz, Rector of the Jesuit College, as a fit person, though\r\nhe had not studied theology; the tribunal of Logroño thereupon reported\r\nfavorably as to his _limpieza_ and, on November 11, 1659, after four\r\nyears of delay, the commission for him was sent.[512] It will be seen\r\nfrom all this that the Mexican Inquisition exercised an independent\r\nfunction of censorship; the earliest printing-press in the New World was\r\nestablished in the city of Mexico and its products were supervised by\r\nthe tribunal, which condemned them, when necessary, without awaiting a\r\nreference to distant Spain. Prohibitory edicts, moreover, emanating from\r\nthe home censorship, were duly published from every parish pulpit\r\nbetween the Caribbean and the Pacific.[513]\r\n\r\nAs was the case in Spain, censorship was not confined to literature but\r\nextended to works of art which might offend sensitiveness either of\r\nmodesty or of veneration. The degree to which this might interfere with\r\naffairs of daily life depended upon the discretion of the tribunal, as\r\nwas instanced by an edict of March 2, 1600. This prohibited all crosses,\r\nheads of Christ, the Virgin and the saints and scenes from sacred\r\nhistory carved or engraved or painted or embroidered on furniture,\r\nbed-clothing, napery, utensils of all kinds, or other places where these\r\nsacred symbols might be exposed to disrespect, and everything of the\r\nkind was to be surrendered for the erasure of the images. As Spanish\r\npiety had luxuriated in the use of such emblems wherever possible, this\r\nraised a cloud of questions, which Fray Diego Múñoz, commissioner at\r\nMechoacan, endeavored to settle in instructions issued to his delegate\r\nat Querétaro. Thus branding-irons for cattle and horses, that had a\r\ncross on them, were to be surrendered; as for beasts already so branded,\r\nthe marks were to be erased where possible. Men tattooed with crosses or\r\nthe name of Jesus were to efface them within fifteen days. Thimbles so\r\nadorned, if of gold or silver, were to be returned after filing off the\r\nsymbols. Moulds for pastry with sacred heads were allowable, because the\r\npastry was eaten and not treated with indecency, and it was the same\r\nwith tapestries and wall-hangings. That the opportunities afforded by\r\nthis decree were not neglected is indicated in a complaint to the\r\ntribunal from Juan Rodríguez of Querétaro, who relates that Fray\r\nFrancisco de Parra, Guardian of the Franciscan convent, under orders\r\nfrom Múñoz, had seized and carried off to the convent a bedstead of gilt\r\nwood, costing 500 pesos, because it had some carved heads, which were\r\nnot of Christ or angels; also counterpanes, pillows, curtains, towels,\r\netc., because they had crosses or the word Jesus embroidered on them,\r\nand finger-rings with five stones set as a cross. Others had suffered in\r\nthe same way, and Rodríguez prayed for the restoration of the\r\narticles.[514]\r\n\r\nIncident to the censorship was the _visita de navíos_, or search of all\r\nvessels on their arrival, regarded as an indispensable duty to prevent\r\nthe importation of forbidden books and the immigration of suspected\r\nheretics and Judaizers, as well as to ascertain whether, during the\r\nvoyage, any one on board had committed acts subjecting him to\r\ninquisitorial jurisdiction. As in Spain, this performance inevitably led\r\nto friction with the secular authorities of the sea-ports. As early as\r\n1584 there is a prosecution of Hernando de Moxica, alcalde mayor, and of\r\nDiego de Yepes, regidor of Vera Cruz, for impeding the commissioner in\r\nthis work and speaking disrespectfully of it, resulting in a fine of\r\nfive hundred pieces each, with excommunication until they should\r\nwithdraw their opposition.[515] Of course it was difficult to control\r\nthe officials of the tribunal in the matter of fees and to keep the\r\npeace between them and the royal representatives as to questions of\r\nprecedence, points which the Concordia of 1633 endeavored to regulate by\r\nfixing the fee at four pesos, of which two accrued to the commissioner\r\nand one each to the alguazil and notary, an amount never to be exceeded,\r\nno matter how many assistants might be employed, while existing orders\r\nwere to be strictly observed as to their concurrence with the royal\r\nofficials.[516] Of course it was not easy for the Inquisition to\r\nmaintain supervision over so extended a coast. In a consulta of February\r\n15, 1620, the Suprema informed Philip III that there had recently been\r\nprinted in Holland large numbers of Spanish Bibles to be sent to the\r\ncolonies and, as the Inquisition was unable to prevent their\r\nintroduction unaided, the king was asked to instruct the royal officials\r\nto exercise greater vigilance. To this he assented and the request was\r\nrenewed, June 28, 1629. It was probably to meet this that, in 1633, an\r\nagreement between the Suprema and the Council of Indies permitted the\r\nappointment of an alguazil in Yucatan to aid in searching the ships\r\narriving at the ports.[517]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith the advent of the Bourbon dynasty, there occurs, in Mexico as in\r\nSpain, a disposition on the part of the secular authorities to restrain\r\nthe overbearing petulance and audacity of the Holy Office. It is true\r\nthat the tribunal obtained a victory in 1712, in a quarrel with the\r\nRoyal Audiencia which had prosecuted its notary, and it was so overjoyed\r\nthat it hastened to communicate the fact to the tribunal of Lima so that\r\nit might serve as a precedent. It related how the royal cédula of 1640,\r\nrepeated in 1667 and 1701, had been strictly observed, when the senior\r\njudge came to the competencia and occupied the lowest seat and the\r\ndecision was that the notary was entitled to the _fuero_ of the Holy\r\nOffice.[518] Though competencias thus commenced to reappear they did not\r\nalways end so satisfactorily. In 1722, Joseph Freire de Somorostro,\r\ncommissioner in Zacatapan, was fined 500 pesos and suspended for six\r\nyears from his functions as an advocate by the royal court, for an\r\noffence against its authority. He appealed to the tribunal which, in its\r\ncustomary threatening methods, demanded that the papers in the case be\r\ndelivered to it within fifteen days, but they were withheld. It\r\nsucceeded better in the case of Alonso Diaz de la Vega, alguazil of\r\nGoamantla who, in 1723, was concerned with his son in a quarrel, in\r\nwhich a man was killed. They were arrested and prosecuted, but the\r\ntribunal interfered vigorously, obtained possession of both father and\r\nson, gave notice that prosecutors must present themselves within eight\r\ndays and, as none appeared, discharged the accused--thus affording\r\nconvincing proof of the advantage of the fuero to criminals. It showed,\r\nhowever, a juster sense of the limitations of its jurisdiction in\r\nanother case of the same year which illustrates the tendency of its\r\nofficials to obstruct the secular authorities. The Castellan of Vera\r\nCruz complained to the viceroy of the commissioner, Gregorio de Salinas,\r\nwho had assisted the mutineers of the fleet in demanding their pay and\r\nhad defended the asylum of the convent of San Francisco, in which they\r\nhad taken refuge. The viceroy forwarded the statement to the tribunal,\r\nwhich forthwith ordered the commissioner to desist; the Inquisition had\r\nnothing to do with the matter; if he had assembled the officials of the\r\nInquisition with their badges and had taken them to the convent to\r\ndefend its right of asylum, he had done very wrong and must instruct\r\neach of them, before a notary, to keep aloof and he must, in the same\r\nway, withdraw the delegated power given to the superior of the convent.\r\nIt does not appear however that the peccant commissioner was punished in\r\nany way for this inexcusable prostitution of the authority of the Holy\r\nOffice. Another case, in the same year, illustrates the multifarious\r\nways in which these petty local officials abused the mysterious\r\nattributes with which they were invested. Valdés la Vandera,\r\ncommissioner of Valle de Santa Barbara, claimed fees for all interments\r\nto which he was invited, even when he did not wear surplice and cap as\r\nordered by the Constitucion Sinodal and, not content with this, charged\r\ndouble fees; he also demanded that, in the assemblies of Corpus, San\r\nPedro and other feasts of obligation, he should have the highest place,\r\nin virtue of being commissioner. The clergy complained to the tribunal,\r\nwhich condemned his pretensions and ordered him to desist.[519]\r\n\r\nThe enlightened despotism of Carlos III brought increased tendency to\r\ncurtail the privileges of the Inquisition and to curb its audacity. A\r\ncédula of February 29, 1760, declares that the titular and salaried\r\nofficials shall enjoy the fuero only as defendants, in both civil and\r\ncriminal matters, and wholly withdraws that of the familiars. Also that\r\nin clear and notorious cases there shall be no competencia, but that the\r\nviceroy, as the personal representative of the sovereign, shall decide\r\nwhat is fitting to prevent invasion of the royal jurisdiction.[520] The\r\ntransitory liberalism of the period greatly diminished the traditional\r\nawe inspired by the Inquisition. About the year 1767, it had a serious\r\nconflict with the Audiencia, over the case of a Doctor Bechi, in which\r\nthe royal fiscal, during his argument, treated it with scant respect,\r\nreciting how Charles V had been obliged to limit its jurisdiction in\r\nSicily, how the reigning monarch had exiled from court the\r\nInquisitor-general Quintano Bonifaz, and hinting not obscurely that, if\r\nit was abolished, substitutes for it could be found--all of which was\r\nmade the subject of bitter, and apparently fruitless, remonstrance to\r\nthe king by the Suprema, in a consulta of February 29, 1768. This\r\nunprecedented freedom of speech reveals the existence of a belief in\r\nsome impending change, and this was stimulated by the startling\r\nexpulsion of the Jesuits, skilfully managed by the viceroy, the Marquis\r\nde Croix, June 25, 1767. The foundations of the ecclesiastical structure\r\nseemed to be crumbling and there arose a universally accredited rumor\r\nthat the Inquisition would be the next to suffer. So definite did this\r\nbecome that the day was fixed for September 3d and the precaution taken\r\nby the viceroy, in anticipation of disturbance, by keeping troops under\r\narms all that night, especially in the quarter where the Inquisition was\r\nsituated, only strengthened the delusion. So firmly rooted was this\r\nthat, when the night passed away without the expected event, the\r\narchbishop called upon the viceroy to learn for himself the truth of the\r\nbelief that the suppression had only been postponed until certain\r\npending trials should be completed.[521]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring this period of decadence the functions of the tribunal, in its\r\nproper sphere of action, amounted to little more than punishing a few\r\nbigamists, so-called sorcerers and soliciting confessors. In 1702 it\r\nreported only four cases pending--three for bigamy and a Jesuit, Padre\r\nFrancisco de Figueroa, for what was known as flagellation, or stripping\r\nfemale penitents and using the discipline on them, an offence akin to\r\nsolicitation.[522] Yet in an auto of 1704 it exhibited eight bigamists\r\nand two sorcerers and, in one of 1708, it had thirteen penitents of whom\r\nfive were bigamists. There was an exception in 1712 when it had the\r\nfortune to present a Judaizer who had denounced himself and begged for\r\nmercy, notwithstanding which he was condemned to appear in an auto with\r\na gag and to irremissible prison and sanbenito for life. In 1712-13\r\nthere were eleven convictions for solicitation and in 1722 an auto with\r\ntwelve penitents, of whom nine were bigamists, followed soon afterwards\r\nwith five cases of solicitation. So it went on, gradually diminishing\r\nand affording less and less justification for the existence of the\r\ntribunal with its large revenues, though when it had an opportunity it\r\ndemonstrated that it retained its capacity for evil, as in the case of a\r\nnaval lieutenant, Manuel Germa de Bahamonde, arrested February 24, 1735,\r\nfor heretical propositions and, after nine years of incarceration,\r\npronounced insane in 1744, when he was sent to the castle of San Juan de\r\nUlua pending transmission to Spain.[523]\r\n\r\nAfter 1750 there was some increase in business, arising from the\r\nprevalence of blasphemy and irreligion in the army, especially in the\r\nregiments of foreigners, and cases became more numerous among foreign\r\nresidents accused of heresy and free-thinking. It was doubtless owing to\r\nthis that Fernando VI, in a decree of December 31, 1756, imposed the\r\ndeath penalty on recruits who pretended Catholicism in order to\r\nenlistment--a severity modified in 1765 by Carlos III to expulsion from\r\nthe kingdom.[524] In spite of these measures, the tribunal, in a letter\r\nof April 28, 1766, complained of the number of foreigners sent to Mexico\r\namong the troops--their disseminating the heresies of Luther and Calvin\r\nand of total irreligion, and their justification of England, thus\r\ndiminishing the horror and detestation felt by the natives for the\r\nEnglish, which it was so desirable to maintain. The Suprema represented\r\nthis to Carlos, who thereupon ordered that no soldiers should be sent to\r\nthe Indies who were not assuredly Catholics.[525]\r\n\r\nThe increasing discredit into which the tribunal had fallen and the\r\nwidely spread rumors, as we have seen, of its approaching suppression,\r\nseem to have stimulated it to a recrudescence of activity in an effort\r\nto assert its continued existence. It celebrated an auto, September 6,\r\n1767, with four culprits--one of them, María Josefa Pineda Morales, for\r\nbigamy, who had been arrested as long before as in 1760. Then on March\r\n13, 1768, it held another with seventeen penitents. Cases of\r\nsolicitation also became more frequent as the century drew to its\r\nclose.[526] A new field of activity, moreover, was opened to it by the\r\noutbreak of the French Revolution, when the propaganda of the rights of\r\nman increased the importance of the Inquisition as an agency of\r\nrepression. Already, in 1770, an edict ordered the denunciation within\r\nsix days of confessors who should use the confessional to encourage\r\nideas contrary to the submission due to the sovereign. The accession of\r\nthe reactionary Carlos IV and the dread of revolutionary principles\r\nbegan to afford a harvest of cases in which politics had more to do than\r\nreligion. There were many Frenchmen in Mexico following their trades;\r\nthey were naturally partizans of the new order of things; their\r\ninfluence was dreaded for they spread their opinions among the people\r\nand the organization and methods of the Inquisition rendered it the most\r\nefficient instrument for the detection and punishment of\r\nliberalism.[527]\r\n\r\nA typical example was that of two Frenchmen, the Capitan Jean Marie\r\nMurgier and Doctor Joseph François Morel, accused of a conspiracy to\r\ncause a revolution and arrested in 1794. Murgier feigned sickness and,\r\nwhen visited by Dr. José Francisco Rada, he asked the gaoler for a glass\r\nof water and during his absence blocked the door with his trunk. Then he\r\nseized Rada’s sword and declared that he would kill both him and\r\nhimself unless the tribunal would liberate him with a full acquittal and\r\nfurnish him with a pair of loaded pistols. The confusion of the tribunal\r\nwas great; parleying went on from 10.15 A.M. to 4.30 P.M., when it was\r\ndecided to break down the door. Guards with hatchets attacked it and\r\nMurgier ran himself through with the sword. His comrade Morel cut his\r\nthroat with a pair of snuffers February 11, 1795. They were prosecuted\r\nafter death and furnished occasion for the last public auto, August 9th\r\nof that year, where their effigies and bones were burnt as those of\r\nheretics, deists and materialists. At the same auto there figured the\r\nfirst Judaizer for many years--Rafael Gil Rodríguez, a cleric in the\r\nlower orders, who had been arrested October 9, 1788. He proved\r\nexceedingly obstinate and was sentenced to relaxation on February 9,\r\n1792, after which he was held awaiting an auto. His resolution failed on\r\nthe morning of the fatal day, he professed repentance, was reconciled,\r\nand thus saved the Inquisition the shame of burning a fellow-creature\r\nalive at the close of the eighteenth century. The other penitents were\r\nJean Langouran of Bordeaux, who was reconciled for Lutheranism and\r\natheism, and Jean Lausel of Montpellier who abjured de levi for\r\nsuspicion of Free-Masonry.[528]\r\n\r\nIt was not however Frenchmen alone who suffered for their political\r\nopinions. José Antonio Rojas was denounced by two ladies, in\r\ncorrespondence with whom he had expressed his liberalism too freely. In\r\nSeptember, 1804, he was condemned, as a formal heretic and materialist,\r\nto reclusion in the College of the Propaganda Fide at Pachuca, but he\r\nescaped to the United States where he relieved his feelings in a\r\ntremendous pamphlet against the Holy Office, which was duly prohibited\r\nin an edict of March 6, 1807. The distinguished publicists, Juan\r\nWenceslao Bosquera and José Joaquin Fernández de Lizardi, known as _El\r\nPensador Mexicano_, were also prosecuted for writings that evinced too\r\nardent a spirit of patriotism. It was also doubtless for offences of\r\nthe same nature that Fray Juan Antonio de Olabarrieta was reconciled for\r\natheism in 1803, and his sanbenito was suspended in the cathedral, for\r\nthe charge of atheism or any kindred form of speculation was, as we have\r\nseen, a convenient one to bring political liberalism under inquisitorial\r\njurisdiction.[529]\r\n\r\nUnder the pressure of the time the censorship was sharpened with special\r\nrigor and severity. A curious instance of the strictness with which the\r\nlaws against prohibited books were enforced is afforded by an episode,\r\nin 1806, of the Louisiana Purchase. As this rendered necessary a\r\ndelimitation of the boundary between Mexico and the United States,\r\nCarlos IV ordered an investigation and report from the viceroy, who\r\nemployed Fray Melchor de Talamantes to make it. He found it necessary to\r\nconsult the works of Robertson and Raynal, but these were in the Index\r\nand he applied to the Inquisition, through the viceroy, for the\r\nrequisite licence, saying that, although the books were detestable, the\r\ninformation they contained, and especially their maps, were important\r\nfor the public service. The request was refused and, as a compromise, a\r\nformal commission was given to two _calificadores_, Fray José Paredo and\r\nFray José Pichardo, to examine the dangerous books and report to\r\nTalamantes such information on the subject as they might find.[530] When\r\nSpanish diplomacy was thus hampered by such scruples it is no cause of\r\nsurprise that the eminent historian of Mexico, Lucas Alaman, was\r\nprosecuted for reading prohibited books and even the episcopal dignity\r\nof Manuel Abad y Queipo, Bishop-elect of Valladolid (Mechoacan) did not\r\nsave him from trouble for the same offence.[531]\r\n\r\nYet this reactionary tendency was accompanied with an increasing\r\ndisposition to enforce the subordination of the Inquisition and to\r\nrender it an instrument of the Government. A royal cédula of December\r\n12, 1807, takes additional precautions to prevent illegal increase in\r\nthe number of familiars and officials and to give the secular authority\r\na closer supervision over them. When secular assistance, moreover, was\r\ncalled for, it could no longer be commanded as a right, except in\r\nmatters of faith; if the temporal jurisdiction was concerned, the\r\nInquisition was put on a level with other ecclesiastical courts, and the\r\nmagistrate was instructed to examine the merits of the case and to give\r\nor withhold his aid accordingly.[532] As agitation in Mexico increased\r\nwith the news of the abdication of Carlos IV and the Napoleonic\r\nusurpation, foreshadowing the Revolution, the political importance of\r\nthe Inquisition, as an agency of repression, became greater and its\r\nso-called sacred functions were more and more subordinated. Successive\r\nedicts of August 27, 1808, and April 28, June 16 and September 28, 1809,\r\nwere directed against all proclamations and emissaries seeking to\r\npervert the loyalty of the colonists in favor of the ambitious schemes\r\nof the French, and the doctrine of popular sovereignty was denounced as\r\nmanifest heresy[533]--a doctrinal definition which was effectively used\r\nduring the debate on the suppression of the Holy Office, in the Córtes\r\nof Cádiz, which had affirmed that sovereignty. Even in a matter so\r\nforeign to politics as solicitation in the confessional, it is\r\nsuggestive to observe that, in the trial for that offence of Dr. Pedro\r\nMendizabal, cura of the parish of Santa Ana (1809-1819) his correct\r\npolitical conduct is urged upon the inquisitors as a matter for their\r\nfavorable consideration--which may possibly have conduced to his escape\r\nin the face of convincing evidence.[534]\r\n\r\nThe political functions assumed by the Inquisition become especially\r\nmanifest in its trials of the two chief martyrs of the war of\r\nindependence--Hidalgo and Morelos. The former of these, Miguel Hidalgo y\r\nCastilla, the parish priest of los Dolores, who first raised the\r\nstandard of revolt, in conjunction with Allende, Aldama and Abasolo, and\r\nwho was elected generalissimo of the insurgent army, was a singularly\r\ninteresting character.[535] Born in 1753, he received his education at\r\nthe royal university of San Nicolás at Mechoacan, where he became rector\r\nand theological professor. In the formal accusation during his trial it\r\nis asserted that he was known while there as _el zorro_, or the fox, on\r\naccount of his cunning, and that he was finally expelled because of a\r\nscandalous adventure, in the course of which he was obliged to escape at\r\nnight through a window of the chapel. Taking orders, he finally settled\r\nas _cura_ at los Dolores where, in spite of a large revenue, he\r\nencumbered himself with debts. He loved music and dancing and gaming and\r\nhis relations with women were of a character common enough with the\r\nclergy of the period. His abounding energy led him to establish\r\npotteries and to introduce silk-culture, which may doubtless account for\r\nhis indebtedness. He was regarded as a prodigy of learning and kept up\r\nhis intellectual pursuits, translating tragedies of Racine and comedies\r\nof Molière, the latter of which he caused to be acted in his house, his\r\nfavorite being Tartufe. The priest, García de Carrasqueda, who enjoyed\r\nhis intimacy for twelve or thirteen years, when on trial by the\r\nInquisition, deposed that they used to read together Cicero, Serri,\r\nFleury’s Ecclesiastical History, Rollings Ancient History and an Italian\r\nwork on commerce by Genovesi and that he praised highly the orations of\r\nÆschines and Demosthenes, Bossuet, Buffon’s Natural History, Pitavak’s\r\nCauses Célèbres and various historical works. He was fond of debating\r\nquestionable points in theology, emitting opinions not wholly orthodox\r\non such subjects as the stigmata of St. Francis, the House of Loreto,\r\nthe Veronica, whether St. Didymas or Gestas was the penitent thief, the\r\ninheritance of original sin, the identity of the three kings and the\r\nlike, while his high reputation for learning caused him to be regarded\r\nas an authority. Altogether he presents himself to us as a man of\r\nunusual physical and intellectual energy, not over nice as to the\r\nemployment of those energies, of wide culture, of vigorous and enquiring\r\nmind and of small reverence for formulas or for authority.\r\n\r\nSuch a character was not likely to escape the attention of the Holy\r\nOffice. On July 16, 1800, Fray Joaquin Huesca, a teacher of philosophy\r\nin the Order of Merced, denounced him to the commissioner of Mechoacan\r\nfor various unorthodox utterances, at which Fray Manuel Estrada, of the\r\nsame Order, had been present, and Estrada, on being summoned, confirmed\r\nand amplified the accusation. In transmitting these depositions to the\r\ntribunal, July 19th, the commissioner reported that Hidalgo was a most\r\nlearned man, who had ruined himself with gambling and women, that he\r\nread prohibited books and, while professor of theology, had taught from\r\nJansenist works. The tribunal necessarily started an investigation,\r\nwhich lasted for more than a year and included the testimony of some\r\nthirteen witnesses, resulting in proof of a wide variety of most\r\nheretical utterances, any one of which, if pertinaciously maintained,\r\nwould have sufficed to consign him to the stake. Moreover, he was\r\ndescribed as revolutionary in his tendencies, speaking of monarchs as\r\ntyrants and cherishing aspirations for liberty; he was well-read in\r\ncurrent French literature and had little respect for the censorship--in\r\nshort he was what was subsequently termed an _afrancesado_. The\r\ncommissioner of San Miguel el Grande reported, March 11, 1801, much\r\nabout Hidalgo’s disorderly life and that he carried about with him an\r\nAlcoran but, in a second report of April 13th, he stated that in the\r\nrecent Easter, Hidalgo had reformed, a matter which was widely discussed\r\nand seems to have aroused general attention. In due time, on October 2,\r\n1801, the fiscal reported on this accumulated testimony that, if Hidalgo\r\nhad uttered the propositions ascribed to him, he should be arrested with\r\nsequestration of property, but the witnesses were contradictory and\r\nEstrada had the reputation of an habitual liar. He therefore recommended\r\nthat the case be suspended and the papers be filed for future reference,\r\nto which the tribunal assented.\r\n\r\nThe case rested until July 22, 1807, when a priest named José María\r\nCastilblane came forward to say that, in 1801, Estrada had told him\r\nscandalous and heretical things about Hidalgo. More serious was a\r\ndenunciation made, May 4, 1808, by María Manuela Herrera, described as a\r\nwoman of good character who frequented the sacraments. By command of her\r\nconfessor she deposed that she had once lived with Hidalgo as his\r\nconcubine, when he told her that Christ had not died on the cross, but\r\nthat it was another man; also that there was no hell--this latter she\r\nsupposed being to quiet her conscience, as they had an agreement that\r\nshe was to provide him with women and he was to provide her with men.\r\nThis was again laid before the fiscal who reported, June 8th, in favor\r\nof awaiting further proof. Then, on March 15, 1809, Fray Diego Manuel\r\nBringas deposed that he had found Hidalgo in possession of prohibited\r\nbooks, such as Serry’s History of the Congregations _De Auxiliis_, under\r\nhis own name and that of Augustin Leblanc, also his Dissertations on\r\nChrist and the Virgin, in which he speaks without measure of María de\r\nAgreda; that Hidalgo praised this work and called María a deluded old\r\nwoman.[536] Still, with singular moderation, no action was taken to\r\nrestrain Hidalgo’s audacity and, had he been content to let politics\r\nalone, it is safe to say that the Inquisition would not have troubled\r\nhim, so inert had it become in the exercise of its ostensible functions.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, he started the revolution, September 16, 1810, this\r\nlethargy gave place to the utmost activity. The official Gazette of\r\nSeptember 28th asserted that he was disseminating among the people the\r\ndoctrine that there is neither hell, purgatory nor glory; an extract\r\nfrom this was sent to the commissioner at Querétaro, with instructions\r\nto obtain its verification, which he had no trouble in doing, although\r\nthe evidence was hearsay. Without awaiting this, however, the testimony\r\nwhich had been so long slumbering in the _secreto_ was laid before\r\n_calificadores_, October 9th, with orders to report at once. This they\r\ndid the next day, to the effect that, as he was a sectary of French\r\nliberty, they pronounced him a libertine, seditious, schismatic, a\r\nformal heretic, a Judaizer, a Lutheran, a Calvinist, and strongly\r\nsuspect of atheism and materialism. The same day the tribunal resolved\r\nthat, as he was surrounded by his army of insurgents and could not be\r\narrested, he should be summoned by edict to appear within thirty days.\r\nOn the 13th the edict was printed, on the 14th it was posted in the\r\nchurches and was circulated as rapidly as possible throughout the land.\r\n\r\nThe edict is a singular medley of politics and religion, illustrating\r\nthe dual character of the Inquisition of the period and the enormous\r\nadvantage to the Government of possessing control over the\r\necclesiastical establishment, whereby an attack on the civil power could\r\nbe made to assume the appearance of an assault on the faith. All the\r\nheretical utterances, discredited nine years before by the action of the\r\ntribunal, are put forward as absolute facts. It is impiety that has led\r\nhim to raise the standard of revolt and to seduce numbers of unhappy\r\ndupes to follow him. In the inability to reach him personally, he is\r\nsummoned, under pain of excommunication, to appear for trial within\r\nthirty days, in default of which he will be prosecuted _in rebeldía_ to\r\ndefinitive sentence and burning in effigy if necessary. All who support\r\nhim or have converse with him and all those who do not denounce those\r\nwho favor his revolutionary projects are declared guilty of the crime of\r\nfautorship of heresy and subject to the penalties decreed for it by the\r\ncanons. When to this are added the proclamations of excommunication\r\nissued against the insurgents by the Archbishop of Mexico and the\r\nbishops of the disturbed districts, it will be seen how powerful was the\r\nrestraining influence exercised by the Church over a population trained\r\nto submission, and how intense were the passions that braved its\r\nanathema.[537]\r\n\r\nIn fact, the hatred of the creoles and the Indians for the _Gachupines_,\r\nor Spaniards, was so bitter that four-fifths of the native clergy\r\nespoused the cause of the insurgents, in spite of the censures of the\r\nChurch, and questions of faith became inextricably involved in the\r\ncontest between the factions. To the loyalists, Hidalgo became a heretic\r\nor indeed a heresiarch, and the confessional was so largely used by them\r\nthat the insurgents became guilty of a new heresy, by asserting that\r\nconfession to a Gachupin priest was invalid. They found great comfort,\r\nmoreover, through their belief in the protection of Our Lady of\r\nGuadalupe, who was universally revered, and especially by the Indians,\r\nas the sovereign patroness of Mexico. On the fateful 16th of September,\r\nwhen Hidalgo was marching on San Miguel el Grande at the head of his\r\nlittle band of insurgents, in passing through Atolonila, he chanced to\r\ntake an image on linen of the Guadalupe Virgin and give it to one of his\r\nmen to carry as a banner. It was adopted by the other bands as they rose\r\nand it became the standard of the insurrection, usually accompanied with\r\nan image of Fernando VII and of the eagle of Mexico, and the inscription\r\n“_Viva nuestra Señora de Guadalupe! Viva Fernando VII! Viva la America y\r\nmuere el mal gobierno!_” Second in rank as a tutelary power of the\r\ninsurrection was Our Lady of Puebla and against these the loyalists\r\npitted a new-comer, Our Lady of los Remedios, who was denounced as a\r\nGachupina by the natives. There is a subject of study for the student of\r\nmythology in this modernization of the triform Hecate and in the revival\r\nof Homeric divinities presiding over the two sides of the battlefield.\r\n\r\nThe Inquisition labored earnestly to get evidence of sacrilegious acts\r\non the part of the insurgents and, as they were beaten back, it had its\r\nemissaries in the territory from which they had been driven, collecting\r\ntestimony as to individuals who had sympathized with them or had opposed\r\nthe posting of its edict. The most active of these was Fray Simon de la\r\nMora, who accompanied the royal army in its advance. He reported that it\r\nwas useless to attempt to enumerate the common people, but he sent the\r\nnames of fifty-nine persons of standing, many of them ecclesiastics,\r\nwith the evidence against them, and the notes on the margin of the MS.\r\nshow that they were forthwith entered for prosecution.\r\n\r\nThe edict was duly posted in the towns occupied by the army but, in the\r\ncourse of a night or two, it was generally torn down or defaced with\r\npaint, in spite of the heavy penalties incurred for thus impeding the\r\nInquisition. Hidalgo felt it necessary to issue a manifesto in defence,\r\nprotesting that he had never departed from the faith and pointing out\r\nthe contradictory character of the heresies imputed to him. To this the\r\nInquisition replied with another edict, January 26, 1811, reiterating\r\nits charges, stigmatizing him as a cruel atheist and prohibiting certain\r\nproclamations issued by the insurgents.[538]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile his trial, _in absentia_, was proceeding through its several\r\nstages as deliberately as though he were an ordinary heretic in time of\r\npeace. On November 24, 1810, the tribunal declared that, having evidence\r\nthat, on October 27th, he had knowledge of the edict, the thirty days’\r\nterm should run from October 28th. On November 28th, therefore, the\r\nfiscal demanded that he should be treated as _rebelde_, or contumacious,\r\nand that ten days, as usual, should be allowed him to appear in person.\r\nThe prescribed three terms of ten days each, with two days additional,\r\nwere scrupulously observed. Then further delay followed and it was not\r\nuntil February 7, 1811, that the formal trial began with the\r\npresentation by the fiscal of the accusation. This was in the ordinary\r\nform, reciting that Hidalgo was a Christian, baptized and confirmed, and\r\nas such enjoying the privileges and exemptions accorded to good\r\nCatholics, “yet had he left the bosom of holy Church for the filthy,\r\nimpure and abominable faith of the heretic Gnostics, Sergius, Berengar,\r\nCerinthus, Carpocrates, Nestorius, Marcion, Socinus, the Ebionites,\r\nLutherans, Calvinists and other pestilential writers, Deists,\r\nMaterialists and Atheists, whose works he has read and endeavored to\r\nrevive and to persuade his sect to adopt their errors and heresies,\r\nbelieving wrongly, like them, as to various articles and dogmas of our\r\nholy religion and revolutionizing the whole bishoprics of Mechoacan and\r\nGuadalajara and great part of the arch-diocese of Mexico, being moreover\r\nthe chief cause of the great abominations and sins, which have been and\r\nstill are committed. All this and more, which I shall set forth,\r\nconstitute him a formal heretic, apostate from our holy religion, an\r\natheist, materialist and deist, a libertine, seditious, schismatic,\r\nJudaizer, Lutheran and Calvinist, guilty of divine and human high\r\ntreason, a blasphemer, an implacable enemy of Christianity and the\r\nState, a wicked seducer, lascivious, hypocrite, a cunning traitor to\r\nking and country, pertinacious, contumacious and rebellious to the Holy\r\nOffice, of all of which I accuse him in general and in particular.” The\r\nfiscal then proceeds to recite the evidence taken since 1800, followed\r\nby a long statement of Hidalgo’s share in the insurrection and winding\r\nup with the customary petition that, without requiring further proof,\r\nthe accused shall be condemned to confiscation and relaxation, in person\r\nif he can be had and, if not, in effigy; or, if the evidence be deemed\r\ninsufficient, he shall be tortured if attainable.\r\n\r\nThe inquisitors received the accusation and gravely ordered, according\r\nto form, that a copy be given to Hidalgo and, in view of his\r\ncontumacious absence, that due notification be made in the halls, which\r\nwas accordingly done and record made. Then, on February 19th, the fiscal\r\naccused the contumacy of the absent and fugitive Hidalgo in not\r\nanswering and asked that the case be concluded and received to proof.\r\nThe inquisitors assented and the proof was presented. May 20th, the\r\nfiscal demanded the publication of evidence, which was duly ordered to\r\nbe made, with the ordinary suppression of their names. A large portion\r\nof this consisted of evidence taken during the insurrection, showing\r\nacts of sacrilege, contempt for the Inquisition and its edicts and the\r\nlike, on the part of Hidalgo and his followers. A copy of this was\r\nordered to be given to him and that he answer it in the next audience,\r\nof which announcement was made in the halls and duly recorded. It was\r\nnot until June 14th that the next step was taken, in ordering a copy of\r\nboth accusation and testimony to be given to him and that by the third\r\nday he put in his answer, with the assent of his advocate, an advocate\r\nbeing provided for him in the person of the Licenciado José María Rosas.\r\nThen another witness was found in the priest García de Carrasquedo, a\r\nprisoner on trial, to whom allusion has been made above. His evidence\r\nwas taken June 21st and, on the 27th, was submitted to calificadores\r\nwho, on August 12th, presented a long and learnedly argumentative\r\nreport, in which they characterized the several propositions with the\r\ncustomary choice selection of objurgatory epithets, as _falsa_, _impia_,\r\n_temeraria_, _blasfema_, _malsonante_, _sapiens hæresim_, _llena de\r\nescandalo_, _erronea_, _sapiens errorem Lutheranorum_, _Judaica y\r\nformalmente hæretica_, _injuriosa al espiritú de la S. M. Iglesia_, and\r\nthey concluded that, if he who uttered them did so with full knowledge\r\nof their import, he was a formal heretic. This was practically the last\r\nact of the long drawn-out comedy, although some additional testimony\r\nconcerning Hidalgo was taken and recorded, February 10 and 20, 1812, in\r\nthe trial of the habitual liar, Fray Manuel Estrada. Events had moved\r\nfaster than the Inquisition. After the disastrous day of the Bridge of\r\nCalderon, Hidalgo in his flight had been captured, March 21, 1811, at\r\nBajan, and carried two hundred leagues farther north to Chihuahua, where\r\nhe was executed, July 31st, before the calificadores had finished their\r\nformulation of his heresies. No notice of this was given to the\r\nInquisition, which was treated with a singular discourtesy, savoring of\r\ncontempt. The explanation of this probably is that, if it had been\r\napprised of the capture, it could rightly have claimed the prisoner as a\r\nheretic, primarily subject to its supreme and exclusive jurisdiction;\r\nthere might have been danger in escorting him back through the recently\r\ndisturbed provinces; the processes of the Inquisition were notoriously\r\nslow and, after it had tried the culprit and he had abjured and been\r\npenanced in an auto de fe, he would still have to be condemned in a\r\nmilitary court. It was in every way wiser to try him and despatch him in\r\nfar-off Chihuahua, and the local military and ecclesiastical authorities\r\ncoöperated to this result, leaving the Inquisition to find out what it\r\ncould, and not even forwarding a supplication which Hidalgo addressed to\r\nit, on June 10th.\r\n\r\nThe tribunal waited patiently for eleven months after the catastrophe\r\nand then, on June 25, 1812, it wrote, with much solemnity, to its two\r\ncommissioners in Chihuahua, reminding them that the edict of October 13,\r\n1810, rendered it their duty to keep it advised of the capture of\r\nHidalgo and of all subsequent occurrences. They should have gone to him\r\nin prison and exhorted him to make a declaration on all points contained\r\nin the edict and whatever else weighed upon his conscience. All signs of\r\nrepentance should have been observed and reported, and at least his\r\nconfession to his judges, in so far as the Inquisition was concerned,\r\nshould have been sent to it. The alcaide, the ecclesiastics and the\r\nmilitary officers must now be examined as to his state of mind during\r\nhis imprisonment, so that the tribunal may be informed as to his\r\nrepentance or impenitence and thus be enabled to render justice. The two\r\ncommissioners are to work in harmony, with power of subdelegation, and\r\nthey are made responsible, before God and the king, for the due\r\ndischarge of their duties.\r\n\r\nThe Holy Office evidently took itself seriously and considered that\r\njudgement as to Hidalgo’s heresies still lay in its hands. There must\r\nhave been a flush of indignation and wounded pride when, on January 2,\r\n1813, the inquisitors received from Sánchez Alvarez, one of the\r\ncommissioners, an answer dated October 27, 1812, reporting that he had\r\napplied to Nemesio Salcedo, the commandant-general, who had ordered him\r\nto suspend all action and that he, Salcedo, would explain the absolute\r\nnecessity for this. The tribunal had to wait until February 27th before\r\nit received Salcedo’s explanation, dated October 22d, showing how its\r\nsupreme jurisdiction had been overslaughed with as little ceremony as\r\nthat of a pie-powder court. With profuse expressions of respect, Salcedo\r\nstated that the peace and prosperity of the provinces required that the\r\nmatter should not be agitated. Hidalgo was not a heretic and would not\r\nhave been permitted to receive the sacraments and ecclesiastical burial,\r\nhad he not been duly absolved and reconciled to the Church. A royal\r\norder, he said, of May 12, 1810, had conveyed papal inquisitorial\r\nfaculties to the bishops, and the Bishop of Durango had subdelegated\r\nDoctor Francisco Fernández Valetin, the doctoral canon of his church,\r\nthus constituting him a papal inquisitor.[539] To him, as such, were\r\ncommunicated the answers of Hidalgo on his trial, who ratified them in\r\nhis presence; he also verified the manifesto of Hidalgo, which was\r\npublished, and he absolved him. In addition he saw the supplication of\r\nHidalgo to the Inquisition, which would have been forwarded sooner but\r\nfor the danger of its being intercepted and which was now enclosed,\r\ntogether with the other necessary papers. These were extracts from\r\nHidalgo’s examination, his manifesto to the insurgents and the\r\nsupplication in question.\r\n\r\nIt was somewhat brutal to have kept the tribunal so long in the dark on\r\na matter touching its highest privilege and to have detained for sixteen\r\nmonths, on a frivolous pretext, a supplication addressed directly to it,\r\nbut its position was becoming precarious and it dared not complain.\r\nNapoleon’s suppression of the Inquisition of Spain, in 1808, did not\r\ncount for much, but the Córtes of Cádiz had enacted a liberal\r\nConstitution in 1812 and simultaneously the preliminary skirmishing for\r\nthe abrogation of the Inquisition preoccupied all minds. It was enacted\r\nFebruary 22, 1813, and, though the news had not as yet reached Mexico,\r\nthe result could scarce have been doubted when the tribunal took action\r\non March 13th. It evidently placed no faith in the story of a papal\r\ninquisitor, suddenly created in the wilds of Chihuahua, for it wholly\r\nignored his action. The fiscal reported to the tribunal that, in spite\r\nof Hidalgo’s supplication for pardon and endeavors to satisfy the\r\ncharges against him, there were not merits enough to absolve his memory\r\nand fame nor, at the same time, to condemn him, as it appeared that he\r\nhad made a general confession and had been reconciled, whereupon the\r\ntribunal ordered the case to be suspended and the papers to be filed in\r\ntheir proper place--an expression of dissatisfaction and an admission of\r\npowerlessness. On March 29th it acknowledged Salcedo’s letter and drily\r\nthanked him.\r\n\r\nHidalgo’s supplication to the Inquisition, written in his prison on June\r\n10, 1811, is a long and dignified declaration of submission, calmly and\r\nclearly reasoned and manifesting full command of his theological\r\nlearning. But for his confinement, he said, he would hasten to throw\r\nhimself at the feet of the tribunal, not only to seek pardon for his\r\ninsubordination, but to vindicate himself from the charge of heresy and\r\napostasy, which was insufferable to him. He answered the various\r\naccusations of the edict, denying that he had led an immoral life and\r\nexculpating himself with much dexterity from the heresies imputed to\r\nhim, but if, he added, the Inquisition deemed his utterances heretical,\r\nalthough he had not hitherto so considered them, he now retracted,\r\nabjured and detested them. He concluded by begging to be relieved from\r\nthe disgrace of heresy and apostasy; the tribunal could repose entire\r\nfaith in his statements for, if he had committed those crimes, the\r\ncircumstances in which he now found himself would impel him to confess\r\nthem freely, in order to gain the pardon and absolution that would open\r\nto him the gates of heaven and would close them, if withheld, in\r\nconsequence of his denial.\r\n\r\nThe frame of mind revealed in this document, which is unquestionably\r\ngenuine, serves to refute the imputation of forgery so generally\r\nascribed to Hidalgo’s manifesto of May 18th, addressed “A Todo el Mundo”\r\nand published in order to quiet the population. Its effusiveness and\r\nextravagance of repentance, and the earnestness of its exhortations to\r\nhis followers to submit, have not unnaturally created suspicion, from\r\ntheir violent contrast to the deep convictions and reckless energy with\r\nwhich he precipitated and sustained the insurrection, but it can be\r\naccepted as authentic without impugning his good faith. He was impulsive\r\nand enthusiastic and was liable to the revulsions incident to his\r\ntemperament. His cause had been disowned by God; he had been captured as\r\na fugitive within a few months after he had been at the head of eighty\r\nthousand men. The grave was yawning for him, as the portal to the\r\nhereafter, in which there was, in his belief, no escape from eternal\r\ntorment for one who died as a rebel to the Church. He was a fervent\r\nCatholic, whose excommunication cut him off from the sacraments\r\nessential to salvation, unless he could prove himself worthy of them by\r\nearnest repentance and by the amendment which could only be manifested\r\nthrough zeal in undoing that which had brought upon him the anathema.\r\nThat under such pressure he should seek to avert the endless doom by\r\nheart-felt contrition was natural, however strange it may seem to those\r\nbrought up in a different faith, who can sympathize with his aspirations\r\nfor liberty but cannot realize the emotions enkindled by his religious\r\nconvictions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe decree of the Córtes of Cádiz, February 22, 1813, suppressing the\r\nInquisition was published in Mexico June 8th. Under it the property of\r\nthe tribunal was applicable to the treasury for the reduction of the\r\npublic debt and was forthwith sequestrated; there were no prisoners, the\r\nfew political ones having been transferred to various convents some days\r\nin advance. We have an authentic account of the transaction, made\r\nDecember 20, 1814, after the Restoration, by the alcaide of the secret\r\nprison. He says that the decree had been eagerly expected; the tribunal\r\nand its ministers were regarded with contempt and its privileges were\r\nset at defiance. Immediately after the publication, Viceroy Calleja\r\nannounced to the senior inquisitor the cessation of its functions; the\r\nnext day the official commissioned for the purpose came to take\r\npossession and commenced an inventory. The building was thrown open to\r\ngaping crowds, who gave free vent to their detestation of the\r\ninstitution. On the 11th, the money in the chest was removed; the\r\nrecords concerning the faith were delivered to the Archbishop Bergosa y\r\nJordan, while the papers connected with property were taken by the\r\nIntendente of the Government, who confided them to the writer and\r\nallotted to him offices in which to keep them. In the Inquisition\r\nbuilding was established the lottery, and the adjacent houses of the\r\ninquisitors served to lodge its officials, while the main building was\r\nused as a barracks and the prisons were turned into shops for tailors,\r\nshoemakers and other workers for the army. The total amount sequestrated\r\nwas 1,775,656 pesos, 5-1/2 reales, consisting of--\r\n\r\nMoney in the coffers                         66,566 pesos, 2-1/2 reales.\r\nCapital invested                          1,394,628  “     1-1/2   “\r\nDue on income of censos                     181,482  “     1.7 gr.\r\nFifteen rented houses                       125,000  “\r\nFurniture, etc., sold at auction, July 19     8,000  “\r\n                                          ---------        -----\r\n                                          1,775,676  “     5-1/2 reales.\r\n\r\nThe alcaide proceeds to give us details as to the organization and\r\nfinances of the tribunal. Besides the inquisitors and fiscal there were\r\nseven secretaries, a messenger, a treasurer, a contador, a purveyor of\r\nthe prison, an alcaide and his assistant, a notary of the\r\nsequestrations, two officials of the _secreto_, an advocate of the fisc\r\nand an advocate of prisoners--a largely superfluous force for the\r\ntrivial work to be performed. The pay-rolls amounted to 33,000 pesos per\r\nannum, the subvention to the Suprema was 10,000, and the expenditure for\r\nmaintaining prisoners, repairs, church functions, etc., brought the\r\nannual outlay to 55,000 or 60,000, while the income was 85,000, to which\r\nwas added 32,000 from the canonries, amounting in all to 117,000--about\r\ndouble the expenses, showing how profitable had proved the purification\r\nof the faith.[540]\r\n\r\nOn August 31st the archbishop reported to the Government that the decree\r\nof suppression had been read in the cathedral on the three Sundays\r\nfollowing its receipt. The sanbenitos were at once removed from the\r\nplaces where they were hung; the Prior of the Hospital of San José asked\r\nfor them to clothe the insane, but the viceroy took them for the troops.\r\nThe Archbishop requested to have the prohibited books, which were stored\r\nin four rooms of his palace, and they were given to him. He was an old\r\ninquisitor and lost no time in assuming the jurisdiction over heresy\r\nrestored to the episcopate by the decree of suppression. As early as\r\nJune 10th, he issued a pastoral ordering denunciation to him of all\r\npersons suspect of heresy and, on September 27th, he published another\r\ncalling for the surrender of all prohibited books by those who did not\r\nhold licences.[541]\r\n\r\nThe decree of suppression provided for the continued salaries of the\r\nofficials and after this the two senior inquisitors disappear--Bernardo\r\nde Prado y Obejero and Isidoro Sainz de Alfaro y Beaumont--probably\r\nreturning to Spain, where refugees from the American tribunals were\r\ntaken care of. The junior, Manuel de Flores, remained and was ready to\r\nresume his functions whenever the “suspension,” as he called it, was\r\nremoved. His foresight was speedily rewarded, for one of the first acts\r\nof Fernando VII on his restoration was the decree of May 4, 1814,\r\nabrogating the Constitution of Cádiz, declaring invalid all laws enacted\r\nunder it and even menacing with the death-penalty all who should keep\r\ncopies of them. This of itself virtually revived the Inquisition, but\r\nlegislation was required to reorganize it and this was effected by a\r\ndecree of July 21.[542] Inquisitor Flores had not waited for this, as we\r\nfind that he had already for some time been gathering evidence against\r\nManuel Abad y Queipo, Bishop-elect of Mechoacan, which he transmitted,\r\nAugust 31st, to the Suprema for its action.[543]\r\n\r\nIt was not until December 23d that Viceroy Calleja notified him to\r\nre-establish the tribunal, in execution of the royal decree of July\r\n21st; this he followed on January 4, 1815, with a proclamation embodying\r\nthe decree and announcing that the tribunal had been restored to its\r\njurisdiction and that its property had been returned to it. The\r\narchbishop also issued a pastoral requiring all denunciations to be made\r\nto it and Flores, on January 21st, published an Edict of Faith ordering\r\nthe denunciation, within six days, of all heresies, prohibited books and\r\nall words of disrespect towards the Holy Office that might subsequently\r\nbe uttered.[544] The tribunal however, was in a sadly dilapidated\r\ncondition. The alcaide in a letter of December 30, 1814, reports that\r\nthe restoration of property consisted in the written securities and the\r\nreal estate, but only 773 pesos of the money had been returned. Notice\r\nhad been given that the fruits of the canonries and interest on the\r\ncensos were to be paid as formerly to the tribunal. The purchaser of the\r\nfurniture, which had been sold at auction in July, was nominally a\r\nmerchant but in reality the Count of la Cortina, from whom they were\r\nendeavoring to get it back at the price which it had brought, but much\r\nhad been resold; the building had to be refitted for their use and\r\naltogether they were in great distress.[545] To add to their troubles,\r\nthe tribunal was so thoroughly discredited that its jurisdiction was\r\ninvaded on all sides in a manner indicating the contempt in which it was\r\nheld. Viceroy Calleja issued a proclamation condemning to the flames the\r\nConstitution adopted by the insurgents October 22, 1814, at Apatzingan,\r\ntogether with various of their sermons, addresses, etc., and ordering\r\nthem to be denounced to him under pain of death. Then, on May 24, 1815,\r\nhe sent a copy of this to the tribunal, inviting it to take action and\r\nuse all rigor for their suppression. This provoked the liveliest\r\nresentment of Flores who complained bitterly to the Suprema, June 29th,\r\nof the intrusion on his jurisdiction and of the discourtesy manifested\r\nin not previously submitting to him the offending papers. He also\r\nenlarged on the harshness with which the decree of suppression had been\r\nenforced in 1813 and of the imperfect restitution of property which\r\nCalleja had publicly asserted to have been made. He had also endeavored\r\nto compel the officials to render military service, but this had been\r\nsuccessfully resisted. In spite of all this indignation, however, the\r\ninsurgent documents were duly censured by the calificadores and, on July\r\n9th, Flores issued an edict condemning them and specifying their errors.\r\nThe chapter of the cathedral (_sede vacante_) had also on May 26th\r\npublished an edict requiring the surrender of these documents to it\r\nunder pain of excommunication and threatening all priests and\r\nbeneficiaries who should not exert themselves against the rebels. This\r\nwas a palpable intrusion on inquisitorial jurisdiction which was deeply\r\nresented, and there was also a quarrel with the royal Audiencia which\r\nthe tribunal accused of invading its jurisdiction and disregarding its\r\n_fueros_ in the matter of a pasquinade of which the Audiencia had taken\r\ncognizance.[546]\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances it is easy to understand how eagerly Flores\r\nseized the opportunity of asserting himself afforded by the capture,\r\nNovember 15, 1815, of the insurgent chief José María Morelos, who\r\nshares with Hidalgo the foremost place in the Mexican Valhalla.[547]\r\n\r\nBorn in 1764 of humble parents, he was an agricultural laborer up to the\r\nage of 25, when he returned to his native Mechoacan and applied himself\r\nto the study of grammar, philosophy and morals. Entering the Church, he\r\ntook full orders and, after serving temporarily the cure of Choromuco,\r\nhe obtained that of Caraguaro, which was under the rectorship of\r\nHidalgo. It must have been a slender benefice for, in his examination,\r\nhe explained his not having taken the indulgence of the Santa Cruzada by\r\nthe plea that before the insurrection he was too poor to pay for it and\r\nafterwards the insurgents regarded it as invalid and as merely a device\r\nto raise money for the war against them. His morals were those of his\r\nclass; he admitted to having three children, born of different mothers\r\nduring his priesthood, but he added that his habits, though not\r\nedifying, had not been scandalous, and the tribunal seemed to think so,\r\nfor little attention was paid to this during his trial and, in the\r\n_calificacion_ which preceded his sentence, it is not even alluded to.\r\nHe joined Hidalgo, October 28, 1810, and must have quickly distinguished\r\nhimself, for that chief gave him a commission to raise the Pacific coast\r\nprovinces and, after the rout of the Bridge of Calderon, the burden of\r\nmaintaining the unequal war fell mainly on Morelos, who was raised\r\nsuccessively to the grades of lieutenant-general and captain-general,\r\nwith the title of Most Serene Highness.\r\n\r\nUnlike Hidalgo, who was hurried off to Chihuahua, Morelos when captured\r\nwas brought to the city of Mexico for trial and execution, arriving\r\nthere on November 21st. He was carried to the Inquisition, not as its\r\nprisoner, but for safe-keeping “on deposit” and Flores, to preserve the\r\nsecrecy of the Holy Office, made it a condition that the guard\r\naccompanying him should not go up stairs or penetrate beyond the first\r\ncourt-yard. It was not until 1.30 A.M. of the 22d that he was lodged in\r\nthe secret prison, in a cell so dark that he could not read the\r\nbreviary, which was given to him on his request. The 22d was occupied\r\nwith an effort to get permission to try him--a competencia carried on in\r\na spirit very different from the masterful audacity of old. Viceroy\r\nCalleja desired that Morelos should be degraded from the priesthood,\r\nwithin three days, by the episcopal jurisdiction, in order that his\r\nexecution should be prompt, and testimony for that purpose was already\r\nbeing taken by the secular and spiritual courts acting in unison. Flores\r\ntherefore had no time to lose in putting forward the claim of the\r\ntribunal, and the fiscal drew up an elaborate paper showing that there\r\nwere points in the case which came within its jurisdiction. On the 23d a\r\n_consulta de fe_ was assembled, consisting of the episcopal Ordinary of\r\nMechoacan, and the consultores of the Inquisition, which represented to\r\nthe viceroy that, although Morelos was subject to both the secular and\r\nspiritual courts, it was persuaded that for other crimes he was\r\njusticiable by the Inquisition and that his trial by that tribunal would\r\nredound to the honor and glory of God as well as to the service of the\r\nState and the king and be efficacious in undeceiving the rebels.\r\nMoreover, it promised that the trial should be concluded within four\r\ndays. Somewhat unwillingly, Calleja granted the request and no time was\r\nlost in commencing the most expeditious trial in the annals of the Holy\r\nOffice--a grim enough comedy to gratify the vanity of the actors, for it\r\ncould have no influence on the fate of the prisoner, save perhaps in\r\nremoving the excommunication under which he inferentially lay. Flores,\r\nin boasting of this activity, adds that they were much embarrassed by\r\nMorelos being frequently taken from them for examination in the other\r\ncourts, which indicates that the authorities regarded the Inquisition as\r\nmerely a side-show.\r\n\r\nHurried as were the proceedings, there was due observance of all the\r\nformalities required by the cumbrous methods of the Holy Office. That\r\nsame day, November 23d, the fiscal presented his _clamosa_, basing it on\r\nMorelos having signed the constitutional decree of November 22, 1814,\r\nas well as various proclamations condemned as heretical by the\r\nInquisition;[548] also on his celebrating mass while under\r\nexcommunication, and his reply to the Bishop of Puebla, when reproached\r\nfor so doing, that it would be easier to get a dispensation after the\r\nwar than to survive the guillotine; also on an edict of Bishop Abad y\r\nQueipo of Mechoacan, July 22, 1814, declaring him to be an\r\nexcommunicated heretic. There was still time for a morning audience and\r\nthe prisoner was brought before the tribunal, where he was subjected to\r\nthe customary examination as to his genealogy and whole career, and the\r\nfirst monition was given to save his soul by confessing the truth. In\r\nthe afternoon he had his second audience and monition. On the morning of\r\nthe 24th came the third audience and monition, during which he admitted\r\nthat, at Teypan, he had captured a package of the edicts against Hidalgo\r\nand had utilized them to make cartridges. The pompous formulas, urging\r\nhim to discharge his conscience so that the Inquisition might show him\r\nits customary mercy, must have seemed a ghastly jest to a man who knew\r\nthat his captors would shortly have him shot, and they contrast\r\ngrotesquely with the feverish anxiety of the tribunal to have a share in\r\nthe performance.\r\n\r\nThat same afternoon the fiscal presented the accusation and, considering\r\nthe haste in which it was prepared, its long accumulation of rhetoric is\r\ncreditable to the industry of the draughtsman. He describes Morelos as\r\nabandoning the Church for the filthy and abominable heresies of Hobbes,\r\nHelvetius, Voltaire, Luther and other pestilent writers, rendering him a\r\nformal heretic, an apostate from the holy faith, an atheist,\r\nmaterialist, deist, libertine, seditious, guilty of divine and human\r\nhigh treason, an implacable enemy of Christianity and the state, a vile\r\nseducer, hypocrite, traitor to king and country, cunning, lascivious,\r\npertinacious and rebellious to the Holy Office. He shows how rebellion\r\nis heresy and all rebellious acts are directly or indirectly heretical.\r\nTo Morelos, in the bottom of his heart, Christ and Belial are equal; he\r\nis even suspect of toleration and, as usual, the accusation concludes by\r\nasking for confiscation and relaxation. The remainder of the afternoon\r\nand the morning audience of the 25th were occupied with the defendant’s\r\nanswers to the twenty-four articles of the accusation. From what he said\r\nit appears that insurgents claimed to be opposing the French domination\r\nin Spain, and that Ferdinand’s restoration in 1814 was largely\r\ndisbelieved or was assumed to be only another phase of Napoleon’s\r\nsupremacy, showing that Ferdinand could not be a sincere Catholic.\r\n\r\nThat same morning the publication of evidence was made, consisting\r\nwholly of documents, such as the Constitution of October 22, 1814,\r\nsundry proclamations signed by Morelos and his printed letter to the\r\nBishop of Puebla, together with the letter of the Bishop of Mechoacan\r\ndeclaring him to be an excommunicated heretic. He was ordered to answer\r\nwith the advice of his counsel and the three advocates of prisoners were\r\nnamed to him, of whom he selected Don José María Gutiérrez de Rosas. He\r\nwas sent to his cell to be brought back directly for an interview with\r\nhis counsel, who was sworn in as customary. There was no time to make\r\ncopies of the papers, so the unusual course was adopted of entrusting\r\nthe originals to Rosas, with instructions to return them and present the\r\ndefence within three hours. In the afternoon he did so and the result\r\nshowed him to be a ready writer, but he was more occupied in justifying\r\nhimself for undertaking the defence than in making a plea for Morelos.\r\nHe savagely denounced the insurrection and the Córtes of Cádiz, whose\r\nprinciples it represented, and he concluded abruptly with a few lines,\r\nalleging the repentance of the defendant, from which he hoped for\r\nabsolution. The inquisitor thereupon ordered the fiscal to be notified\r\nand the case to be concluded.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, November 26th, Flores assembled his calificadores and\r\nexhibited to them the proceedings and the condemnations of the\r\ninsurgent Constitution and proclamations. Fray Domingo Barreda opined\r\nthat the accused savored of heresy, but the rest were unanimous that he\r\nwas a formal heretic, who denied his guilt and was not only suspect of\r\natheism but an atheist outright. In the afternoon was held the _consulta\r\nde fe_ to decide upon the sentence. Without a dissentient voice it\r\nagreed that a public auto should be held at 8 o’clock the next morning\r\nin the audience chamber, in the presence of a hundred prominent persons\r\nto be designated by Flores. That Morelos should there be declared guilty\r\nof malicious and pertinacious imperfect confession, a formal heretic who\r\ndenied his guilt, a disturber and persecutor of the hierarchy and a\r\nprofaner of the sacraments; that he was guilty of high treason, divine\r\nand human, pontifical and royal, and that he should be present at the\r\nmass in the guise of a penitent, in short cassock without collar or\r\ngirdle and holding a green candle, which, as a heretic and fautor of\r\nheretics, he should offer to the priest. As a cruel persecutor of the\r\nHoly Office, his property should be confiscated to the king. Although\r\ndeserving of degradation and relaxation, for the crimes subject to the\r\nInquisition, yet, as he was ready to abjure he was, in the unlikely case\r\nof the viceroy sparing his life, condemned to perpetual banishment from\r\nAmerica and from all royal residences and to imprisonment for life in\r\nthe African presidios, with deprivation of all preferment and perpetual\r\nirregularity. His three children were declared subject to infamy and the\r\nlegal disabilities of descendants of heretics. He was to abjure\r\nformally, and be absolved from the excommunications reserved to the Holy\r\nOffice; he was to make a general confession and through life to recite\r\nthe seven penitential psalms on Fridays and a part of the rosary on\r\nSaturdays. Moreover a tablet was to be hung in the cathedral, inscribed\r\nwith his name and offences.[549]\r\n\r\nThe next morning, November 27th, as Flores reports, the auto was duly\r\ncelebrated in the most imposing scene ever witnessed in the audience\r\nchamber, which was crowded with five hundred of the most important\r\npersonages of the capital. The mass was followed by the impressive\r\nceremony of degradation from the priesthood, performed by the Bishop of\r\nOaxaca. Morelos was delivered to the royal judge and returned to the\r\nsecret prison whence, at 1.30 of the following night, he was transferred\r\nto the citadel. Flores might proudly claim to have vindicated the\r\njurisdiction of the Holy Office, at some sacrifice of its dignity, in\r\nthe shortest trial of a formal heretic to be found in its records. The\r\nobject of the indecent haste required by Calleja is scarce apparent, for\r\nMorelos was not executed until December 22d.\r\n\r\nThe tribunal continued to perform its functions. In 1817, the\r\nprosecution of Don José Xavier de Tribarren, for reading prohibited\r\nbooks, revealed that Don Cayetano Romero of Guetaria in Guipúzcoa was\r\nequally guilty, and the Suprema in Madrid forthwith ordered the tribunal\r\nof Logroño to take action against him.[550] The latest notable victim\r\nwas Fray Servando Teresa de Mier Noriega y Guerra. After holding him for\r\nsome time in prison, the tribunal, in anticipation of its extinction,\r\nsent him to the viceroy as an important offender against the State, with\r\na paper describing him as hating, from the bottom of his heart, the\r\nking, the Córtes and all legitimate government, and even as lacking\r\nrespect for the Holy See and the councils of the Church, his dominant\r\npassion being revolutionary independence, which he had vigorously\r\npromoted in both North and South America, by his writings full of\r\npassion and venom.[551]\r\n\r\nThis useless prolongation of existence was soon to end. One of the first\r\nmeasures of the revolution of 1820, which restored the Constitution of\r\n1812, was the royal decree of March 9th, suppressing the Inquisition.\r\nBefore this reached Mexico officially, the Viceroy Count of Venadita\r\nhad seen it in the _Gaceta de Madrid_ and had arranged for the\r\nextinction of the tribunal. The officials ceased their functions on May\r\n31st; as before, they had transferred their political prisoners to the\r\npublic prison and those for matters of faith to various convents, the\r\narchives were delivered to the custody of the archbishop and the\r\nofficials hastened to find other homes. Then, on June 14th, the viceroy\r\nsent orders for compliance with the decree and, on the 16th, the\r\nInquisitor Antonio de Pereda reported that the tribunal had ceased in\r\nall its functions and remained in a condition of absolute extinction.\r\nThe papers of pending trials were distributed among the appropriate\r\ndiocesans and the Intendente took possession of the property.[552] The\r\nofficials straggled back to Spain, where they were provided for in\r\ncommon with those of the Peninsula. In the accounts of 1833 there still\r\nappear as in receipt of salaries the senior inquisitor, Antonio de\r\nPereda, the secretaries Venancio de Pereda y Cassolla and José María\r\nBriergo, and the _nuncio y portero_, Tomás del Perojo.[553]\r\n\r\nThus forlorn and discredited passed away the tribunal which had in its\r\nprime cast terror over all the provinces between the two oceans, but the\r\nimpression which it had produced did not disappear with it. In 1821 Don\r\nCelestino de la Torre reprinted a savage attack issued in Spain, under\r\nthe title of “Memorial de la Santa Inquisicion,” which he says, in a\r\nprefatory note, is for the disillusionment of the _serviles_ who sigh\r\nfor the restoration of the Holy Office. It is still more significant\r\nthat, in the agitation caused, in 1833, by the effort of the Government\r\nto reduce the Church to acquiescence in the new order of things, there\r\nappeared a little anonymous tract entitled “Mientras no haya Inquisicion\r\nse acaba la Religion”--“Without the Inquisition, Religion is\r\ndestroyed”--arguing that heresy can never be suppressed without the use\r\nof force; excommunication, censures and argument are of no avail and the\r\nfaith of Christ can only be preserved by arming the bishops with all\r\nthe powers and methods of the Inquisition and enforcing their penal\r\nsentences by the State. The bishops, in fact, were quite ready to assume\r\nits functions as far as they could for, as late as 1850, on the\r\nappearance of a translation of Féréal’s _Mystères de l’Inquisition_,\r\nwith notes by Don Manuel de Cuendias, a diocesan _junta de censura_ was\r\nheld which, without hearing the accused, passed a sentence of\r\nexcommunication on the editor and on all who should read the book, all\r\nof which was publicly proclaimed by edict. This was based on a consulta\r\npresented to the junta by Doctor Sollano, who lamented the abolition of\r\nthe Inquisition and proved satisfactorily that heresy merits the\r\ndeath-penalty.[554]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PHILIPPINES.\r\n\r\nWhen Spain, in 1566, undertook the conquest of the Philippines, they\r\nwere not erected into a separate government but were placed under the\r\nvice-royalty of New Spain or Mexico, with a governor or captain-general\r\nin command. When, in 1581, the bishopric of Manila was founded, it was\r\nsuffragan to the archbishopric of Mexico and was not erected into a\r\nmetropolitan see until 1595. The islands therefore were included in the\r\ndistrict of the Mexican Inquisition, but they were too sparsely occupied\r\nby Europeans for the tribunal to think it necessary to establish an\r\norganization there. When, however, the first bishop, the Dominican\r\nDomingo de Salazar, reached his see in 1572, his zeal led him at once to\r\nestablish an episcopal Inquisition with a fiscal and other officials,\r\nand the regular inquisitorial procedure; he soon found culprits and held\r\na formal auto de fe, exercising his assumed authority with excessive\r\nseverity. Don Francisco de Zuñiga, a youth of 20, in a discussion, had\r\nthoughtlessly declared fornication to be no sin; then on reflection he\r\ndenounced himself, but notwithstanding this he was obliged to appear in\r\nan auto with a gag, and was banished for ten years, with a threat of two\r\nhundred lashes if he returned. Canon Francisco de Pareja, suspected of\r\nbeing one of the Alumbrados of Llerena, when arrested for solicitation,\r\nhanged himself in prison. Some of Salazar’s penitents on reaching Mexico\r\ncomplained to the tribunal and thus aroused its attention to this\r\ninvasion of its jurisdiction, when it lost no time in vindicating its\r\nrights. March 1, 1583, it sent a commission as commissioner to the\r\nAugustinian Fray Francisco Manrique, a man of prominence in his Order,\r\nwhich was the most influential in the islands, and at the same time it\r\nnotified Salazar that it had done so in consequence of his having\r\nassumed to act as inquisitor.[555]\r\n\r\nBishop Salazar, who was on the point of celebrating an auto de fe, was\r\nby no means disposed to abandon the authority which he had assumed. He\r\nrefused to recognize the commission of Manrique and threatened with\r\nexcommunication all who should do so. The Licenciado Juan Convergel\r\nMaldonado, who supported Manrique, was thrown into prison so harsh that\r\nhe became insane, when Salazar sent him to Mexico, and Benito de\r\nMendiola, who had served as Maldonado’s messenger, was likewise\r\nimprisoned. The traditional rivalry between the seculars and regulars\r\nand between the different Orders brought to the bishop ample support\r\nfrom the clergy, the Franciscans and the Jesuits--a high authority among\r\nthe latter, Padre Alonso Sánchez, even declared that those who\r\nrecognized the commissioner committed mortal sin. For six months Fray\r\nManrique kept up the struggle and then abandoned it, writing to the\r\ntribunal, April 1, 1584, that, to avoid scandal he would do nothing more\r\nuntil it should have provided a competent remedy. The tribunal took\r\nprompt and effective steps. It wrote to Manila revoking all the acts of\r\nthe bishop and to the Suprema, January 17, 1585, reciting the\r\ncircumstances and pointing out the grave consequences that would follow\r\nwhen Salazar’s success should lead other bishops to follow his example.\r\nThrough the Suprema it also addressed a letter to Philip II, who\r\nresponded, May 26th, with a cédula to the bishop, telling him that he\r\nhad invaded the jurisdiction of the Inquisition and ordering him to\r\nabstain from interfering in any way in affairs pertaining to it or with\r\nthe duties of its commissioners. This was decisive but it was uncalled\r\nfor. Salazar had already seen his error, had recognized Manrique and had\r\nhanded over to him the papers in all the cases--seven in number--then\r\npending before him. Thus the jurisdiction of the Mexican tribunal was\r\npermanently established over the islands, although subsequently there\r\nwere one or two attempts made to organize an independent Inquisition\r\nthere.[556]\r\n\r\nIn this the tribunal regarded rather its own ambition to extend its\r\njurisdiction than the interests of the faith, for the whole career of\r\nthe Philippine commissionership manifests the impossibility of\r\nconducting such a business at the distance of a hundred and forty\r\ndegrees of longitude, when perhaps a year or two might pass without a\r\nvessel reaching Acapulco from Manila. The duties and powers of a\r\ncommissioner were strictly limited and defined. As a rule he could do\r\nnothing except in execution of orders from the inquisitors; without such\r\norders he could not make arrests, unless there was immediate danger of\r\nthe escape of the accused; he could only gather information, report it\r\nand await instructions, and it was the same with regard to\r\nsequestration; if involved in a competencia he could issue inhibitions\r\non the rival judges, but he could not put into execution the censures\r\nand penalties threatened in the formulas unless authorized by the\r\ntribunal.[557] In the detailed instructions sent to Manrique along with\r\nhis commission there is little concession made to the difficulties of\r\ndistance and communication by enlarging his powers. Although he is not\r\nallowed to sequestrate property, he is to inventory it and see that it\r\nis left in charge of a proper person, but this must be an arrangement\r\nbetween the accused and the depository in which the Inquisition assumes\r\nno responsibility. He is expressly told that he can make no arrests\r\nwithout orders, but an exception is made in the case of bigamy, on\r\naccount of its frequency, when, if he obtains positive evidence against\r\na culprit, he can arrest him and send him to Mexico, confining him in\r\nthe royal gaol at the public expense, while awaiting a vessel. On the\r\nother hand, he is not to interfere with the secular or spiritual courts\r\nwhen they prosecute for bigamy and, if they offer to surrender an\r\noffender, he is to tell them to send him to Mexico, but not at the\r\nexpense of the Inquisition.[558] Subsequently, in 1611, another\r\nexception was made, in the crime of solicitation in the confessional.\r\nThe tribunal wrote to the Suprema that, in consequence of the number of\r\ndenunciations, and in view of the need of the culprits’ presence in the\r\nPhilippines, whither they had been sent at the royal expense, it had\r\nordered that only two who seemed most guilty should be shipped to Mexico\r\nfor trial and sentence. It further suggested that in future the\r\ncommissioner should have power, in conjunction with a judge or other\r\nqualified person, to try the cases and send merely the papers to Mexico\r\nwhere the sentence should be rendered. To this the Suprema assented,\r\nadding that, in view of the distance and delay, the prisoner should\r\nmeanwhile be discharged on bail--which indicates that in these cases the\r\ncommissioner could arrest.[559] This does not seem to have been strictly\r\ncarried out for, in 1613, we chance to hear of three culprits of this\r\nkind, sent from Manila to Mexico, with the papers, for sentence. One of\r\nthese, Francisco Sánchez de Santa María, was accused by twenty-three\r\nnative women, and another, Don Luis de Salinas, had been shipwrecked on\r\nthe coast of Japan and the papers had been lost; he succeeded in getting\r\nback to Manila, where the commissioner tried him again and despatched\r\nhim to Mexico.[560]\r\n\r\nAnother exception to the prohibition of arrest was made in the case of\r\nsoldiers who deserted to the Dutch or to Moros and embraced their faith.\r\nWhat to do with these cases presented a problem concerning which the\r\nMexican tribunal consulted the Suprema, as burning them in effigy might\r\nprevent their coming back. The Suprema thereupon submitted the matter to\r\nPhilip III, representing that the soldiers were exposed to such\r\nprivations that they were forced to fly and find refuge wherever they\r\ncould, and meanwhile it advised the tribunal to await the action of the\r\nroyal councils. To this the tribunal replied at much length, May 20,\r\n1620, stating that no action had as yet been taken in such cases, but\r\nthat the commissioner was ordered to proceed against the culprits and,\r\non convicting them, to send them to Mexico for sentence. The whole\r\ndiscussion, however, was purely academical; there is no trace of such\r\nculprits being forwarded to the tribunal and this, possibly, for the\r\nvery good reason that the military authorities punished the offence with\r\ndeath, when they could lay hands on the delinquents.[561] There was\r\nanother class of cases in which the commissioners seem to have exercised\r\nthe power of arrest. In 1666 we find the tribunal complaining to the\r\nSuprema that soldiers, to escape the rigor of military law, sought\r\nprosecution by the Inquisition in order to be arrested and sent to\r\nMexico and to this end would blaspheme or utter heretical propositions.\r\nMany of them died on the passage and the expense of this bore heavily on\r\nthe tribunal. For this the Suprema had no remedy to suggest except the\r\nplan adopted with soliciting confessors.[562] With these exceptions and\r\nthe _visitas de navios_, or searching vessels for prohibited books, the\r\nduties of the commissioner were restricted to receiving denunciations,\r\ntaking testimony, reporting to Mexico and executing such orders as he\r\nmight receive from there. Still, they were personages of importance;\r\nalthough frailes living in their convent cells, they organized an\r\nimperfect kind of court; they had their assessors, notaries, treasurers,\r\nconsultors and calificadores, their alguazil mayor and familiars and\r\ndeputized their powers to sub-commissioners in the various parts of the\r\nislands.\r\n\r\nOf real inquisitorial work for the purity of the faith we hear little.\r\nDuring the sixteenth century the only evidences of activity are three\r\ncases of Judaizers--Jorje and Domingo Rodríguez of Manila, reconciled in\r\nthe Mexican auto of March 28, 1593, and Diego Hernández, regidor of\r\nVitoria, accused by his cook of ordering her to cut chickens’ throats\r\ninstead of strangling them; his property was sequestrated and evidence\r\nagainst him was sought in Oporto from whence he came, but he died during\r\nthese prolonged preliminaries.[563] The seventeenth century is similarly\r\nbarren, affording few instances except the occasional bigamists and\r\nsoliciting confessors, military culprits and sometimes a few Dutch\r\nprisoners of war. In the Mexican auto of 1648 there appeared Alejo de\r\nCastro, an octogenarian sent from Manila on suspicion of Mahometanism,\r\nsentenced to perpetual exile from the Philippines and to servitude for\r\nlife in a convent for instruction in the faith.[564] A more noteworthy\r\nculprit was Padre Francisco Manuel Fernández, S. J., a devotee of Luisa\r\nde los Reyes, a Tagal beata who had ecstasies. He declared that she had\r\ndied many times and that God had resuscitated her so that she should\r\nsuffer for the souls in purgatory; he compared her for sanctity to St.\r\nTeresa, St. Catherine and St. Inez and insisted that when he kissed her,\r\nembraced her and handled her indecently, he had no sensual feeling. It\r\nwas a clear case of Illuminism against which the Inquisition waged\r\nunsparing war, nor was Fernández the only culprit, for another Jesuit,\r\nPadre Javier Riquelme was also compromised. Luisa was prosecuted in 1665\r\nand testimony was taken against the Jesuits, but the Mexican tribunal\r\nreported, July 17, 1770, to the Suprema that the case had been suspended\r\nowing to the activity of the Jesuits in the islands, who always made the\r\ncause of their members their own. It complained bitterly of the way in\r\nwhich they impeded the Inquisition and frustrated its labors, when any\r\nJesuit was concerned, whether for solicitation or other offence. They\r\nwere not to be believed, for there was the case of the French Father\r\nPierre Peleprat, whose detention was ordered, when they asserted that he\r\nwas dead, but subsequently it was reported that this was not so but that\r\nhe had been sent to France.[565]\r\n\r\nThe eighteenth century offers a similarly eventless record. So great was\r\nthe inertness that the Edict of Faith, which was the chief source of\r\ndenunciations and which should be published yearly in all parish\r\nchurches, became virtually obsolete. From the time of Commissioner\r\nPaternina, who published it in 1669, forty-nine years elapsed before it\r\nwas again published, in 1718, by Commissioner Juan de Arechederra; and\r\nFray Juan de la Concepcion, writing in 1790, tells us that it had never\r\nbeen published since then.[566] It was a somewhat remarkable and\r\nuncalled-for burst of energy on the part of Commissioner Bernardo de\r\nUstáriz, in 1752, when a score of Moro sailors of an English ship\r\nperformed some pagan rites with songs and incense and he applied to the\r\narchbishop and then to the governor for aid to punish the scandal. Both\r\ndeclined, when he got General Antonio Romero, who was a familiar, to\r\nundertake an investigation. Then force was needed to arrest the culprits\r\nand a prison to confine them, and Romero sought the Marquis of Ovando,\r\nthe governor for this, but Ovando replied that the matter was under his\r\nexclusive jurisdiction, an assertion which he repeated to Ustáriz,\r\nadding that he intended to punish the guilty. Ustáriz complained of this\r\nto the tribunal, which declared, February 19, 1754, that the governor\r\nhad failed in his duty; that his assertion of cognizance of such cases\r\nshould be expunged from any instrument in which it appeared, and that\r\nthe commissioner and notary should notify him of this in person. The\r\nSuprema, however, took a cooler view of the matter, pointing out that,\r\nby the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, English subjects could not be\r\nprosecuted for practising their religion in Spanish territory, but at\r\nthe same time it approved of the action of the tribunal and promised to\r\nask the king to make due provision for the future.[567] Seeing that\r\nbaptism was necessary to give jurisdiction to the Inquisition and that\r\nnatives, even when converted, were not subject to it, this sudden access\r\nof zeal on the part of Ustáriz would appear somewhat supererogatory.\r\n\r\nUstáriz also showed his energy, in 1750, by arresting Pierre Fallet, a\r\nSwiss of Neuchâtel and a convert from Calvinism. In 1742 Commissioner\r\nArechederra had taken from him two indecent prints; in 1748 Commissioner\r\nJuan Alvárez had deprived him of another and denounced him to the\r\nMexican tribunal as suspect of heresy. The tribunal, on March 14, 1748,\r\nordered his arrest with sequestration, at the same time dismissing\r\nAlvárez for his indiscretions and replacing him with Ustáriz. The\r\nsequestration showed that Fallet’s property consisted of some\r\nuncollectable credits and many debts but, among his books on history,\r\nvoyages and mathematics, in English, French, Flemish, Spanish, Latin and\r\nGreek, were found two prohibited ones--Rapin’s History of England and a\r\n“Historia publica y secreta de la corte de Madrid.” He was duly sent to\r\nMexico, where he entered the secret prison, January 17, 1752, with\r\nbroken health. An accusation of seventy-six articles was accumulated\r\nagainst him, but his sentence on August 8th consisted merely of\r\nabjuration for light suspicion, three months’ reclusion in the Jesuit\r\nCollege for instruction and some spiritual penances. This laborious\r\ntrifling, so ruinous to the unfortunate subject, was crowned by the\r\nSuprema, which pondered over the case until March 7, 1772, when it\r\nordered its suspension. Fallet, meanwhile, had been allowed to return to\r\nthe Philippines, where his conduct was reported as exemplary.[568]\r\n\r\nCensorship of a similarly futile kind was exercised in the denunciation\r\nof objectionable books or passages, which had to be forwarded to Mexico\r\nfor action. Of this a single example will suffice. At the end of the\r\nsixteenth century, the Dominican Fray Francisco de San José was one of\r\nthe most zealous and successful missionaries. He left a number of works\r\nin Tagal, some of which were printed, while others reposed in MS. Among\r\nthe latter was a volume of sermons that had considerable repute, and in\r\nthis the Augustinian Fray Juan Eusebio Polo, in 1772, discovered a\r\npassage conveying the Dominican view entertained at the period, as to\r\nthe Immaculate Conception of the Virgin. Not daring to denounce it to\r\nthe Dominican commissioner, he did so directly to the Mexican tribunal,\r\nadding that he could not send the MS., because it was borrowed, but he\r\nfurnished certificates of two of his Augustinian brethren as to the\r\naccuracy of his translation. This was forwarded to the Suprema which, on\r\nJanuary 27, 1774, ordered a copy of the book to be searched for in\r\nMexico and Manila, the translation to be examined by experts, the matter\r\nto be voted on and then referred back to Madrid. Apparently this ended\r\nthe case.[569]\r\n\r\nIf the natives were exempt from inquisitorial jurisdiction, they were\r\nsubject to that of the missionary fathers and it may be questioned\r\nwhether in this they were to be envied. About 1756 an obstinate revolt\r\nin the Island of Bonol throws some light on the relations between the\r\nconverts and their spiritual guides. A district belonging to the\r\nJesuits was placed under the control of Padre Morales who, observing\r\nthat one of his subjects did not attend mass or frequent the sacraments,\r\nordered him to be arrested. The man was known to be a desperate\r\ncharacter and it was not until Morales laid explicit commands on the\r\nalguazil mayor of the village that the attempt was made, which resulted\r\nin the killing of the alguazil and the flight of the culprit. Francisco\r\nDagohoy, brother of the slain, brought the corpse to Morales for\r\nChristian burial, which the padre refused, unless the regular fees were\r\npaid, intimating moreover that the alguazil had died under\r\nexcommunication as a duellist. Naturally exasperated, Dagohoy, who was a\r\nleader among his people, assembled them, set forth their wrongs\r\neloquently and had little difficulty in persuading them to follow him to\r\nthe mountains, to the number of some three thousand. Entrenching\r\nthemselves, they kept up a predatory warfare, in which Morales was\r\nkilled and also an Augustinian Fray Lamberti. The rigor with which the\r\ntaxes were exacted by the Spaniards drove many to join them and the\r\nrebellion was still flourishing in 1792, in spite of repeated overtures\r\nand offers of pardon--indeed, it may be doubted whether it was ever\r\ncompletely pacified under Spanish domination.[570]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhile this Philippine branch of the Inquisition accomplished so little\r\nfor the faith, it was eminently successful in the function of\r\ncontributing to the disorder and confusion which so disastrously\r\naffected Spanish colonial administration. As everywhere else, the\r\nimmunity of the officials was a fruitful source of trouble. In 1601,\r\nBenito de Mendiola, a familiar, was prosecuted in the secular court for\r\nthe murder of Roque Espina de Cáceres, secretary of the governor, but\r\nthe commissioner interposed and a long competencia followed, at the end\r\nof which, after a delay of ten years, the papers in the case were\r\nordered to be surrendered to him by a decree of the Suprema of November\r\n28, 1611. In consideration of the distance and delay, Mendiola was\r\nliberated on bail; the widow of his victim desisted from the prosecution\r\nand finally, after further postponement caused by the difficulties of\r\ncommunication, the Mexican tribunal sentenced him to four months’\r\nbanishment, two months’ suspension from his office as notary and a fine\r\nof fifty pesos--a punishment sufficient to show his guilt and his escape\r\nfrom justice.[571]\r\n\r\nThe same question came up, in 1635, under Governor Sebastian Hurtado de\r\nCorcuera, whose stormy term of office was a continuous succession of\r\nbroils with the several ecclesiastical jurisdictions. The Archbishop\r\nHernando Guerrero was engaged in a mortal struggle, first with the\r\ngovernor and then with the Jesuits, in which his experience singularly\r\nresembled that of Bishop Palafox of Puebla. He was twice excommunicated,\r\nhis temporalities were seized and he was relegated for a time to\r\nCorregidor Island. Compelled to a humiliating submission, he took the\r\nprecaution of making a preliminary protest before the notary Diego de\r\nRueda, whereupon the governor seized Rueda and threw him into the castle\r\nof Santiago. It chanced that he was a familiar; the commissioner, Fray\r\nFrancisco de Herrera, claimed him and excommunicated the _juez\r\nconservador_ of the Jesuits, who had excommunicated the archbishop. The\r\njuez yielded to the superior jurisdiction of the Inquisition and ordered\r\nRueda released, but the Governor stood firm and when Herrera sent two\r\nfrailes of his order with a demand for the prisoner, Corcuera seized\r\nthem and sent them to Cavite with orders to confine them in their\r\nconvent.[572] This was probably but a small part of Herrera’s contests\r\nwith the civil power for, in 1636, Corcuera applied to the Mexican\r\ntribunal asking that frailes be no longer appointed as commissioners, on\r\naccount of the disturbances which they excited; if clerics of prudence\r\nwere selected, peace would be preserved and the scandals caused by the\r\nDominicans would be averted. In 1638 the Council of Indies renewed the\r\nrequest to Philip IV, asking that prebendaries of the churches should be\r\nchosen; Philip sent corresponding instructions to the Suprema but, on\r\nits remonstrating, he referred the matter back to the Council and\r\nnothing was done.[573]\r\n\r\nCorcuera’s successor, Diego Fajardo, had an opportunity of learning the\r\nextent to which the audacity of a commissioner could reach, and the\r\nutter disregard of all considerations of public policy. About 1650, an\r\norder came to the commissioner to seize, with the utmost secrecy, the\r\ngovernor of one of the provinces, who was also commandant of a fortified\r\npost. The commissioner quietly summoned his alguazil mayor and a\r\nsufficient number of familiars, sailed for the province, surprised the\r\ngovernor in his bed, carried him off and imprisoned him in a convent\r\nuntil there should be a vessel sailing for Acapulco. Fajardo was an\r\nirritable and passionate soldier, whose governorship was a continuous\r\nbroil with the warring jurisdictions of the colony, and who could\r\nappreciate the risk of depriving a fortified place of its commander, at\r\na time of perpetual warfare with the Dutch and the natives. His wrath\r\nwas expected to be extreme at the contempt thus shown for his office and\r\nfor the safety of the colony, but his reverential fear of the\r\nInquisition overcame all other considerations and, when informed of the\r\nmatter, he gently rebuked the commissioner for not having afforded him\r\nthe opportunity of earning the graces and indulgences granted for\r\nparticipation in so pious a work, as he would have eagerly served as an\r\nalguazil in making the arrest.[574]\r\n\r\nYet perhaps the most troublesome of the commissioners with whom the\r\nInquisition afflicted the islands was the Augustinian Fray José de\r\nPaternina Samaniego. He was grossly ignorant and had led a disorderly\r\nlife in both Spain and Mexico. His fellow Augustinian, Fray Cristóbal de\r\nLeon, told him that he was unworthy to occupy so high an office, for he\r\nwas an apostate whom the General of the Order had condemned to the\r\ngalleys when visiting the convents of Old Castile, whereupon he accused\r\nCristóbal to the provincial as a Jew and a usurer, causing his\r\nimprisonment with such harshness that it cost him his life. Yet this was\r\nthe man whom the inquisitor-general sent to the Philippines, in 1663, as\r\ncommissioner. His unfitness soon manifested itself, and his prelates\r\nwrote to the Mexican tribunal recommending his replacement; other\r\nremonstrances were sent to the Suprema, which ordered the collection of\r\nmaterial against him, and nothing further was done.[575]\r\n\r\nOn board the ship which carried Paternina to Manila there was another\r\npassenger, Don Diego Salcedo, a Fleming who, as _maese de campo_, had\r\nrendered distinguished service in the Flemish wars, and who was coming\r\nto the Philippines as governor. The two men conceived a mutual dislike\r\nwhich was heightened when Salcedo dismissed from command of the fleet\r\nDon Andrés de Medina, who was a close friend of the commissioner, and\r\nrefused employment to his nephew, González Samaniego. Still bitterer\r\ngrew his hatred when Salcedo succeeded him in the favors of a married\r\nwoman, whose paramour he had been, and he openly declared that he would\r\nbe revenged.\r\n\r\nSalcedo was arbitrary and covetous; he must have made full use of the\r\nopportunities afforded by his position, for at his death his fortune was\r\nreckoned at 700,000 pesos--much of which he had the prudence to remit to\r\nMexico. He was not popular; he was speedily involved in the dissensions\r\nwhich seemed inevitable, with Archbishop Poblete, and a faction was\r\nformed against him at the head of which stood the commissioner. A\r\nconspiracy for his ruin was organized and in February, 1666, there came\r\nto the Mexican tribunal letters from Paternina, from the archiepiscopal\r\nnotary and from the Castellan of Manila accusing him of indifference to\r\nthe service of God and the king and of his communication with Dutch\r\nheretics. Then the archbishop, in a letter of June 20, 1666, to the\r\ninquisitor-general, represented that Salcedo surrounded himself with\r\nFlemings and Dutchmen, one of whom was a Calvinist; that he never\r\nattended mass on feast-days or heard sermons; it was not known that he\r\nconfessed or took communion except at Easter; that he created scandal by\r\nhis relations with a married woman and that his cupidity was insatiable.\r\nThis brought from the queen-regent a letter of November 11, 1666, to\r\nSalcedo, reprimanding him for his disregard of church observances, but\r\nnothing more. Paternina sent fresh accusations to the tribunal, and the\r\narchbishop and the Bishop of Cebu wrote to the Viceroy of Mexico; then\r\nthe tribunal ordered its commissioner at Acapulco to examine secretly\r\nthe passengers and crews of vessels arriving from the Philippines and\r\nall the accumulation was sent to the Suprema which, on November 22,\r\n1667, ordered the case to be suspended; Paternina must act with caution\r\nand, if he obtained further information, he was to forward it.\r\n\r\nThe failure of his plans thus far showed Paternina that he must assume\r\nthe responsibility. Archbishop Poblete died December 8, 1667, and it was\r\nnot until September, 1668, that the commissioner was ready to take\r\nvigorous action, assured of the support of two judges of the Audiencia\r\nwho hoped to succeed to power, of high officials with whom Salcedo had\r\nquarrelled, and of individuals to whom promises were made of offices,\r\n_encomiendas_ and other advantages, while there was the enticing\r\nprospect of plunder in the sequestration of the governor’s fortune. It\r\nwas not difficult to obtain from his enemies evidence such as it\r\nwas--evidence which the Mexican tribunal subsequently pronounced not\r\nonly to be factitious on its face, but to amount at most only to a\r\npresumption _plusquam leve_. This was submitted, September 28th, to\r\nnine frailes as calificadores, some of whom pronounced the accused to be\r\nvehemently suspect of the errors of Luther and Calvin. Then three\r\nconsultors were called together--the Dean José Millan de Poblete, nephew\r\nof the archbishop, the archiepiscopal provisor, Francisco Pizarro de\r\nOrellano, and the Licenciado Manuel Suárez de Olivera, from whom Salcedo\r\nhad taken 12,000 pesos and who was soon afterwards prosecuted for\r\nJudaism. These worthies on October 6th decided that the commissioner\r\ncould proceed to arrest, seeing that the three prescribed conditions\r\nwere more than fulfilled. Of these conditions the most important, in the\r\npresent case, was the danger of immediate escape of the accused, for\r\nwhich, as an afterthought, there was subsequently collected testimony so\r\ntransparently futile that the Mexican tribunal described the danger of\r\nflight as a mere baseless pretext.\r\n\r\nThe forms having thus been observed, Paternina, on October 8th, issued\r\nthe warrant of arrest addressed to the Admiral Vizcarra y Leiva as\r\nalguazil mayor--Vizcarra having been one of the principal witnesses. It\r\nordered him to seize Salcedo wherever he could be found, to sequestrate\r\nhis property and deliver it to Fray Mateo Ballon, guardian of the\r\nFranciscan convent. Salcedo was aware of the machinations against him,\r\nbut imagined himself in full security and took no precautions. The\r\nwarrant was delivered to the admiral at 9 P.M. on October 9th and\r\nbetween 12 and 1 A.M. he entered the palace with a band of Franciscan\r\nfrailes armed with pikes, swords and bucklers. They seized Salcedo in\r\nbed, fettered him and, without allowing him to dress, carried him as he\r\nwas in a hammock to the Franciscan convent and threw him into a narrow\r\ncell. After a few days he was removed to the house of the Capitan Diego\r\nde Palencia, his declared enemy, and then to the Augustinian convent of\r\nSan Pablo, where Paternina kept him _incomunicado_ and chained to the\r\nwall. The day of the arrest the judges ordered the bells of the\r\ncathedral to be rung as a sign of rejoicing that they had assumed the\r\ngovernment. In fact, one of the judges, Juan Manuel de la Peña Bonifaz,\r\nan accomplice in the conspiracy, assumed the nominal government and\r\nthere ensued a period of terror for all who were not of their faction.\r\nPaternina became the virtual ruler and he inspired general fear by\r\nbanishing ten or twelve of the principal citizens, by forbidding any one\r\nto speak of the affair under heavy penalties and excommunication, and by\r\nbringing charges against a number of persons of being hostile to the\r\nInquisition. The rich sequestration became an object of plunder. A\r\nnephew of Bonifaz profited largely from it, nor was Paternina neglectful\r\nof the chance, for we happen to hear of his entrusting 20,000 pesos to\r\nthe Capitan Pedro Quintero, to be used for his benefit, and also of his\r\nextorting bribes from shipmasters for delivering to them goods embargoed\r\nwith those of the governor. In short, as the Mexican tribunal reported\r\nto the Suprema, they committed a thousand iniquities.\r\n\r\nHow long Salcedo lay in his chains does not appear, but it must have\r\nbeen more than eighteen months, for he was probably shipped to Mexico\r\nduring the summer of 1670. He died at sea November 24 of that year,\r\nmaking a most Christian end, for he confessed three times. A further\r\nproof of his orthodoxy may be found in the fact that he appointed as his\r\nexecutor the Mexican Inquisitor Ortega Montañes--a position which the\r\nSuprema forbade him to accept--and the estate was handed over, when the\r\nsequestration was lifted, October 31, 1671, to Don Gerónimo Pardo,\r\nAuditor of the Audiencia, who held powers from Salcedo’s sister and\r\nthree brothers.\r\n\r\nThe vessel by which Salcedo was shipped did not reach Acapulco until\r\nJanuary 7, 1671, being the first that had come for two years. It brought\r\nthe earliest direct intelligence of the events at Manila and the report\r\nof Paternina, but the news had already arrived there by way of Batavia,\r\nHolland and Madrid. In Madrid it had naturally aroused the Council of\r\nIndies which presented to the queen-regent a consulta embracing three\r\npropositions: I. If the commissioner made the arrest without orders from\r\nthe tribunal, he should be severely punished for exposing the colony to\r\nrisks so great. II. If the arrest was by order of the tribunal, it\r\nshould have notified the Viceroy of Mexico in order that he might make\r\nprovision for simultaneously filling the vacancy. III. That precise\r\ninstructions for the future should be given for the arrest of persons of\r\nthat rank, in conformity with the royal cédulas and concordias providing\r\nfor such cases. To this the Suprema, still completely in the dark as to\r\nthe circumstances of the case, replied somewhat superciliously that, if\r\nthe commissioner had exceeded his duty, he would be punished\r\nappropriately; that the arrest was not ordered by the tribunal but, if\r\nit had been, no notice was due to the viceroy in matters of faith; the\r\ncédula of April 2, 1664, provided for the government of the Philippines\r\nin cases of vacancy, which is all that human foresight can anticipate.\r\nNo new instructions were necessary, as such cases were already provided\r\nfor in the existing regulations; sentences on persons of the rank of Don\r\nDiego Salcedo were not executed without consulting the Suprema, except\r\nwhen irremediable injury might be anticipated from delay, and it was an\r\naccepted rule that, in important cases of faith, all such personages\r\nwere subjected to the Inquisition. To this the Council of Indies\r\nrejoined by insisting that it should not be left to the discretion of a\r\ncommissioner to determine whether the danger of delay justified\r\narresting a governor and imperilling the safety of the colony; the\r\ntribunal should give notice to the viceroy, without violating the\r\nsecrecy of the Inquisition, and it concluded by asking that definite\r\ninstructions be given to the inquisitor-general and Suprema that in\r\nmatters of such importance such action should be taken as would avoid\r\nthe danger of a recurrence of similar proceedings. Even the Council of\r\nIndies did not venture to hint that the governor of an important colony,\r\nif suspected of heresy, could not be suddenly arrested, and it only\r\nobjected to this being done without preliminary precautions.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1670, the news of Salcedo’s arrest filtered through Madrid to\r\nMexico but it was not until January 7, 1671, that the official report\r\nfrom Paternina reached Acapulco. The tribunal, in forwarding, January\r\n18th, an abstract of this to the Suprema, made haste to exculpate itself\r\nfrom all responsibility, pronouncing the whole affair to be the greatest\r\nabuse ever committed by an official, especially by one of the\r\nInquisition, a trampling on justice, with grievous discredit to the\r\nprudence and equitable procedure of the Holy Office, arising from hatred\r\nof Salcedo and carried out by a conspiracy between Paternina and the\r\njudges who desired to seize the government. This rendered necessary\r\nexemplary punishment, so that all might understand that the tribunal did\r\nnot undertake to punish crimes that did not pertain to it, nor serve as\r\nan instrument for the gratification of passion, and this demonstration\r\nshould be made in Manila, in order that the honor and fame of Salcedo\r\nmight be restored, although he had lost life and fortune. The tribunal\r\ntherefore, while awaiting instructions, proposed to suspend Paternina\r\nand give his office to another, with orders to shut him up in a convent\r\nand also to raise the sequestration. This it did and appointed as his\r\nsuccessor Fray Felipe Pardo, though when the Suprema, June 4, 1671,\r\nconfirmed the suspension, with incredible blindness, it replaced him\r\nwith the Dean José Millan de Poblete, who had been his active\r\naccomplice. Pardo however probably retained the office, as the dean had\r\nbeen promoted to the bishopric of Canaries, and one of the results of\r\nthe affair was to transfer the commissionership from the Augustinians to\r\nthe Dominicans.\r\n\r\nPaternina escaped the punishment which he merited for he died, January\r\n18, 1674, like his victim, on the voyage to Acapulco. The Suprema had\r\nordered his imprisonment and trial, but the sentence was not to be\r\nexecuted without its confirmation. Despite its assurance to the Council\r\nof Indies that nothing more was necessary to regulate arrests of\r\ngovernors, it issued, under pressure from the queen-regent, June 30,\r\n1671, a carta acordada prescribing special rules for such occasions.\r\nMeanwhile in Manila there had been a natural revulsion. The new\r\ngovernor, Manuel de Leon y Saravia, took full advantage of the\r\nopportunity to emancipate the secular power from the predominance of the\r\necclesiastical. He withdrew the sequestrated property out of the hands\r\nof the treasurer of the Inquisition; he released Juan de Berestain who\r\nhad been imprisoned as an accomplice of Salcedo; he prosecuted and\r\nbanished the Franciscan provincial and the guardian of the Franciscan\r\nconvent, and the good frailes complained that they were persecuted as by\r\nan enemy; and we are assured that he reduced the power of the Holy\r\nOffice until its officials were so despised that if they had to arrest\r\nthe vilest individual no one would help them.[576]\r\n\r\nThere is nothing more connected with the Philippine commissionership\r\nthat is worth relating, except to explain the disappearance of its\r\nrecords. When the British captured Manila, October 5, 1762, these were\r\nnot removed from the city. No attention was paid to them at first but,\r\non March 12, 1763, an English Catholic and Don César Fallet, who had\r\nbeen penanced by the Inquisition, informed the commissioner, Fray Pedro\r\nLuis de Serra, that he was about to be arrested and the archives to be\r\nseized, whereupon he burnt them all and when the English came they found\r\nnothing. He was taken before the authorities where he told what he had\r\ndone; the tribunal approved of his action and sent him renewed\r\ninstructions.[577]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlthough not directly connected with our subject, there is interest in\r\nobserving the zeal with which the purity of the faith was conserved in\r\nthe Far East. The commissioner, Juan de Arechederra, in a letter of July\r\n6, 1724, from Manila to Francisco de Garzeron, inquisitor and inspector\r\nof Mexico, encloses a sentence rendered in Canton by Fra Giovanni\r\nBonaventura de Roma, as delegate judge and commissioner of Giovanni de\r\nCazal, Bishop of Macao, on Antoine Guigue, a French missionary convicted\r\nof Jansenism. Guigue, it appears, had obeyed orders in publishing the\r\nappeal of his archbishop, Cardinal Noailles, to a future council against\r\nthe bull _Unigenitus_, he had maintained that councils are superior to\r\npopes, that popes sometimes erred and other Jansenist heresies, besides\r\nreceiving and circulating Jansenist books. Moreover it was asserted that\r\nhe had been guilty of solicitation when on missions in the interior. He\r\nhad not obeyed the citations and had allowed the trial to go by default,\r\nwherefore his sentence was publicly read, March 1, 1724, in the church\r\nSiaò Nân Muen of Canton. He was suspended from all priestly functions,\r\nhe was ordered to leave the province and betake himself to a convent in\r\nwhich he was to remain, performing certain spiritual exercises, until he\r\nhad satisfied the pope, and all this under penalty of perpetual\r\nimprisonment for disobedience.[578] The Emperor of China at the time was\r\nordering all Christian missionaries to leave his dominions, but the\r\ncommon danger was insufficient to allay the strife arising from Pasquier\r\nQuesnel’s speculations on sufficing attrition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nPERU.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen, on January 9, 1570, Servan de Cerezuela arrived at Lima to open a\r\ntribunal of the Inquisition, the condition of Spanish South America was\r\nsuch as to call for energetic action if the colony was to respond to the\r\nhopes of those who had so earnestly urged the Christianization of the\r\nNew World. The establishment there of the Holy Office had been asked for\r\nby many who viewed with dismay the prevailing demoralization, and we\r\nshall see whether its influence proved to be for good or for evil. Peru\r\nhad been conquered by adventurers inflamed with the thirst of gold, who\r\nin the eager search for wealth had thrown off the restraints of\r\ncivilized life. The Church exercised little or no moral power for, as\r\nthe existing Viceroy, Francisco de Toledo, reported, he found on his\r\narrival that the clerics and frailes, bishops and prelates, were lords\r\nof the spiritual and acknowledged no superior in the temporal. The king\r\nwas exposed to constant outlay in granting free passage by every fleet\r\nto great numbers of clerics and frailes who came under the pretext of\r\nconverting and teaching the Indians, but, in reality, many devoted\r\nthemselves to accumulating wealth, plucking the Indians in the endeavor\r\nto return to Spain with fortunes. These priests kept prisons, alguaziles\r\nand chains, seizing and punishing all who offended them and there was no\r\none to call them to account. The bishops pretended to have royal\r\nlicences to return to Spain, laden with the silver which they had not\r\nalready gathered and despatched in advance, and it was the same with the\r\nfrailes.[579] This deplorable statement is confirmed and strengthened\r\nby Toledo’s successor in the vice-royalty, the Count del Villar, in\r\n1588. The secular clergy, he says, from the bishops to the lower grades,\r\nhave come to Peru, not to save the souls of the Indians but to gain\r\nmoney in any manner and return to Spain, while those who are ordained in\r\nthe country are mostly soldiers discharged for ill-conduct or men of bad\r\ncharacter. The regular Orders are no better, except to some extent, the\r\nFranciscans and more especially the Jesuits. The royal officials use\r\ntheir positions to make money and oppress the people. Few immigrants\r\nseem to come with the intention of honest labor, but are mostly vagrants\r\nliving on the hospitality of those who will receive them. The\r\ndescendants of the _conquistadores_ claim positions in virtue of the\r\nservices of their ancestors and, as they increase in number with each\r\ngeneration, it is impossible to satisfy them or the impostors who\r\npretend to be descendants. With all this the Christianization of the\r\nIndians makes little or no progress. Altogether he assumes that the\r\nimmigration, both lay and clerical, is thoroughly vicious, while the\r\ncreoles, or native whites, are no better.[580] It is a community living\r\nin idle self-indulgence on the Indians and the Government.\r\n\r\nAs regards matters of faith, in the absence of the Inquisition, the\r\njurisdiction over heresy, inherent in the episcopal office, had\r\nreasserted itself and was exercised by the bishops. As early as May 15,\r\n1539, the Dominican Provincial, Gaspar de Carvajal, is found acting as\r\ninquisitor for the Bishop Fray Vicente de Valverde and, on October 23 of\r\nthe same year, the secular magistrates honored a demand from the bishop\r\nfor the process against Captain Mercadillo, in order that, as\r\ninquisitor, he should take cognizance of certain ebullitions of\r\nblasphemy. This inquisitorial power was exercised to its highest\r\nexpression, for, in 1548, the first Archbishop, Gerónimo de Loaisa, held\r\nan auto de fe in Lima, wherein Jan Millar, a Fleming, was burnt for\r\nProtestantism. In 1560 the episcopal Provisor of Cuzco held an auto in\r\nwhich were relaxed the Morisco Alvaro González and the mulatto Luis\r\nSolano as dogmatizing Mahometans; in 1564 he celebrated another in which\r\nVasco Suárez, Antonio Hernández and Alonso de Cieza were penanced, while\r\nLope de la Peña was reconciled for Islam. In 1565 the Dean of la Plata\r\nreconciled Juan Bautista for Protestantism and condemned him to\r\nconfiscation and perpetual prison and sanbenito.[581] Evidently the\r\nepiscopal Inquisition was active; in 1567 the synod of Lima adopted\r\nregulations to govern its functions and when, in 1583, the provincial\r\ncouncil, under St. Toribio, confirmed the acts of that synod, it was\r\nobliged, doubtless on representation by the tribunal, to except those\r\nregulations as matters which had passed beyond its control.[582] The\r\nbishops, however, did not surrender their jurisdiction without\r\nimpulsion, for, as we have seen (Mexico, p. 199), the Suprema was\r\nobliged to order them, in 1570, to transfer all cases to the tribunal\r\nand it was found necessary to repeat this in 1586.\r\n\r\nWhen the transfer was made there were four cases pending in Lima and\r\nninety-seven in Cuzco, concerning which the fiscal reported that the\r\nOrdinaries had prosecuted many that were not matters of faith and were\r\nhabitually settled for a trivial payment in oil. Inquisitor Cerezuela\r\nset a good example by suspending three and ordering the rest to be filed\r\nfor reference in case of relapse.[583] One of the cases thus inherited\r\nby the tribunal may be briefly sketched as affording a vivid picture of\r\nthe methods in vogue and the use made of the Inquisition, whether\r\nepiscopal or Spanish.\r\n\r\nFrancisco de Aguirre was one of the prominent conquistadores. He had\r\ncome well equipped to Peru in 1533, he had borne an active share in the\r\nconquest of Chile and then in that of the extensive interior province\r\nknown as Tucuman, of which he became governor. Of this he was deprived,\r\nbut about 1566 he was reappointed on the occasion of an Indian revolt,\r\nin which the Spaniards were murdered and only a handful of soldiers held\r\nout in the town of Santiago del Estero. With his customary energy\r\nAguirre collected a force, defeated the Indians in a battle, in which he\r\nlost one of his sons, and re-established the Spanish dominion. Then he\r\nheaded an expedition in search of a port on the Atlantic to afford\r\neasier access to the territory, but when near his destination his troops\r\nmutinied and carried him back as a prisoner to Santiago del Estero. To\r\njustify this the mutineers claimed to have acted under orders of the\r\nInquisition of the Bishop of la Plata, with whom Aguirre had quarrelled\r\non the subject of tithes. There were witnesses in plenty to hasty and\r\nirreverent speeches by the veteran soldier; for two or three years he\r\nwas kept in prison, at a cost to him, as he declared, of thirty thousand\r\npesos, and on October 15, 1568, by judges acting under commission of\r\nBishop Navarrete “inquisidor ordinario y general” he was sentenced. His\r\nimprisonment was accepted as a punishment; he was fined in fifteen\r\nhundred pesos and costs and was required to appear as a penitent in the\r\nchurch of Santiago del Estero and make formal abjuration of his\r\nobjectionable speeches. This he performed, but on the pretext of\r\ninformality he was obliged to undergo the humiliation a second time,\r\nApril 1, 1569, in la Plata. Of this a notarial act was sent to the\r\nCouncil of Indies to show that he was unfitted to be Governor of\r\nTucuman, but it was too late, for in August of that year he received the\r\nroyal confirmation of his appointment with orders to proceed at once to\r\nhis seat of government. On the march a cleric with an order from the\r\nbishop sought to stop him, but he disobeyed and paralyzed the\r\nunfortunate messenger by sternly asking him “If I should kill a cleric,\r\nwhat would be the penalty?”\r\n\r\nSo far he had had to deal with the episcopal Inquisition in the hands of\r\nan opposing faction; even severer experiences were in store for him from\r\nthe Holy Office, used as an instrument by the Viceroy Toledo who desired\r\nto get rid of him. One of the earliest acts of the Lima tribunal was to\r\nentertain a denunciation of him, in which his intemperate utterances\r\nwere again brought forward, together with the further accusation that he\r\nhad banished from Tucuman all who had been concerned in his prosecution\r\nand that he had said that he had been forced to confess to what he had\r\nnot done. March 14, 1570, Cerezuela ordered his arrest with\r\nsequestration of property; Toledo undertook to execute the mandate and\r\nin reporting to the king stated that Aguirre’s government was such that\r\nmost of the inhabitants were leaving the province. To arrest such a man\r\nwas not an easy matter, but it was effected and he was brought three\r\nhundred leagues to Lima. Delays were unavoidable in obtaining and\r\nratifying testimony at such a distance, through a hostile Indian country\r\nwhich, as the tribunal stated, was entered only once a year. Aguirre\r\noffered to waive the formality of ratifying the testimony in order to\r\nexpedite the process, but the fiscal insisted on regularity and the\r\ntrial dragged wearily on, as new evidence came in, mostly as to his\r\narbitrary government and other matters with which the tribunal properly\r\nhad no concern. Aguirre fell dangerously ill and was transferred, July\r\n19, 1572, to the house of a familiar, where he was kept strictly\r\n_incomunicado_ and from which he was brought back, April 24, 1574, to\r\nlisten to the publication of evidence. It was not until late in 1575 or\r\nearly in 1576 that sentence was rendered condemning him to hear mass as\r\na penitent on a feast-day when no services were allowed in any other\r\nchurch; he abjured _de vehementi_, was cast in all costs, was recluded\r\nfor four months in a convent and was banished perpetually from Tucuman.\r\nThe trivial character of the charges is seen in the special stress laid\r\non his having used charms to cure wounds and toothache, which he was\r\nforbidden to do in future--innocent charms, as he explained, employed\r\nonly because no physician was at hand and surely pardonable in the wild\r\nwarfare in which he had worn out his life. He retired to the city of\r\nSerena which he had founded, old, sick and penniless. He had spent\r\nthirty-six years and some three hundred thousand pesos in the king’s\r\nservice; three of his sons, his brother and three nephews had died in\r\nthe same service, and he was too poor and oppressed with debts to make\r\nhis way to court and ask reward for his labors. To complete the\r\ndestruction of his influence his two remaining sons were prosecuted on\r\nfrivolous charges, but the cases seem to have been suspended after the\r\ndesired result had been attained. His son-in-law, Francisco de Matienzo,\r\nwho had endeavored to prevent his arrest, was prosecuted and fined in\r\nthree hundred pesos. There were also seven other prosecutions against\r\nhis followers, resulting in the imposition of fines.[584] Had all\r\nviceroys, like Francisco de Toledo, known how to control the Inquisition\r\nit might have been made a useful political instrument but, as we shall\r\nsee, succeeding inquisitors preferred to follow their own ends and it\r\nbecame a perpetually disturbing influence.\r\n\r\nThe bishops did not willingly acquiesce in the surrender of a\r\njurisdiction which could be so profitably employed. That Archbishop\r\nLoaiza showed a recalcitrating temper is manifested by a letter of the\r\nSuprema directing that he should not style himself “inquisidor\r\nordinario” in his pastorals and edicts. Another letter permits him to\r\ninspect the commissions of the inquisitors and their instructions if he\r\ndesires, but it must be in the audience-chamber as they are not to be\r\nremoved from there, except the printed instructions, of which a copy may\r\nbe given to him on condition of his allowing no one to see it. There was\r\nevident friction despite the injunctions of the Suprema that a good\r\nunderstanding should be maintained.[585] This was increased when, in\r\n1574, a royal cédula addressed to the bishops ordered them to exercise\r\nspecial vigilance and make secret inquiry about disguised Lutheran\r\npreachers who were said to be on their way to Peru. The prelates assumed\r\nthis to be a grant of renewed inquisitorial power and undertook to\r\nexercise it, giving rise to no little trouble. Sebastian de Lartaun,\r\nBishop of Cuzco, not only published edicts trespassing on inquisitorial\r\njurisdiction but boasted that, if the inquisitors came into his diocese,\r\nhe could punish them, and he arrested and imprisoned in chains their\r\ncommissioner Pedro de Quiroga, a canon of his cathedral, publicly and\r\nunder circumstances creating great scandal. The tribunal retaliated by\r\nsummoning to Lima the bishop’s provisor Albornoz and throwing him in the\r\nsecret prison; furthermore it imprisoned the priest Luis de Arma, who\r\nhad assisted in chaining Quiroga, as well as the episcopal fiscal Alonso\r\nDuran and a cleric named Bejerano for the same offence, to which the\r\nbishop responded by seizing Quiroga’s temporalities and forbidding him\r\nto enter the church. The tribunal, in 1581, reported the situation to\r\nthe Suprema, which replied that nothing was to be conceded to the\r\nOrdinaries save what was allowed by the laws and the royal cédulas;\r\nfrom the Bishop of Cuzco’s edict the matter pertaining to the\r\nInquisition was to be struck out and he was to be duly warned. A second\r\nnotice was to be given to the Bishop of Panamá of the cédulas forbidding\r\nhis interference in matters of faith and, if he continued to disobey,\r\nthe Suprema was to be advised. The same was to be done with other\r\nbishops similarly offending, and special attention was directed to the\r\nacts of the Bishops of Popayan and Tucuman. If we may believe the\r\nreports made by the tribunal to the Suprema the episcopate was filled\r\nwith most unworthy wearers of the mitre and the Archbishop of New\r\nGranada was the only one who had fully obeyed the orders to hand over\r\nall inquisitorial cases. The officials of the Inquisition, it said, were\r\nhated equally by the bishops and by the royal judges, who lost no\r\nopportunity of oppressing and humiliating them.[586]\r\n\r\nThus early commenced the antagonism between the Inquisition and the\r\nepiscopate which continued during its whole career to be a disturbing\r\nelement in the Spanish possessions. In 1584 we find Inquisitor Ulloa\r\ncomplaining to the Suprema of the action of the recent provincial\r\ncouncil of Lima in secretly writing to the king about the evil character\r\nof the commissioners selected. This, he asserts, arose from his refusal\r\nof the request of the Bishops of Cuzco, la Plata and Tucuman to make\r\nthem commissioners in their respective dioceses. The bishops, he adds,\r\nwere opposed to the introduction of the Inquisition, because it limited\r\ntheir jurisdiction, and they and the royal courts were constantly\r\ncausing trouble in spite of the extreme modesty and deference shown by\r\nhis officials.[587]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuch was the soil in which the Inquisition was to be planted when Philip\r\nII resolved to confer upon the New World the blessing of the\r\ninstitution. Its inception bore a marked resemblance to that of Mexico.\r\nJanuary 28, 1569, Inquisitor-general Espinosa wrote to the Licentiate\r\nServan de Cerezuela, in Oropesa, that the king proposed to establish a\r\ntribunal in Peru and that he was selected as an inquisitor, with a\r\nsalary of three thousand pesos, each of four hundred maravedís, a part\r\nof which would be drawn from the fruits of a prebend in Lima. He was\r\nordered to start without delay for Seville, whence he would sail with a\r\ncolleague, a fiscal and a notary, in the fleet carrying the Viceroy\r\nFrancisco de Toledo, who would deliver to him his commission and\r\ninstructions. Similar orders were sent to the other inquisitor, Dr.\r\nAndrés de Bustamente, and five hundred ducats were given to each to\r\ndefray their expenses. Commands were issued to the bishops to surrender\r\nall cases pertaining to the tribunal; to the courts not to interfere\r\nwith the confiscations; to the viceroy to render it all favor and\r\nsupport and to provide a proper building for its occupancy and prisons;\r\nto all officials to take the oath of obedience and to lend whatever aid\r\nmight be required.[588]\r\n\r\nThe fleet sailed March 19, 1569; Dominica was reached April 28th,\r\nCartagena May 8th and Nombre de Dios, June 1st. There their funds ran\r\nout and no one would lend them a real without interest until Judge\r\nBarros of Panamá furnished them two thousand pesos out of moneys\r\ndeposited in his court. While thus delayed they heard several cases and\r\nrendered sentences. Bustamente with the notary Arrieta left Nombre de\r\nDios on June 23d, but he was so affected by the escape of two of his\r\nslaves, as we are told, that he fell sick and died on June 30th.\r\nCerezuela and the fiscal Alcedo remained to attend to a case which\r\ndeveloped itself on the day fixed for their departure. Six witnesses\r\ntestified that a Portuguese named Salvador Méndez Hernández had been\r\nburnt in effigy in Seville; they arrested him and wrote to Seville for\r\nthe process, but as they had no arrangements for detaining him, he was\r\nreleased under oath, which he naturally forfeited. Cerezuela reached\r\nPanamá on July 18th, when he summoned the viceroy and the judges of the\r\nAudiencia to take the oath of obedience to the Inquisition. On the 22d\r\nthere was a solemn ceremony, with a procession to the church of San\r\nFrancisco, where his commission was read, he issued a mandate and the\r\nviceroy and officials and the people all took the oath. Sail was made\r\nfrom Panamá, August 15th, and Lima was reached November 28th. A house\r\nwas selected and the viceroy was called upon to give it to them; another\r\nadjoining was rented for the officials and, on January 29, 1570, there\r\nwas a solemn function in the cathedral, such as we have seen in Mexico,\r\nwhen the tribunal was officially acknowledged, its authority asserted\r\nand the Edict of Faith was published, calling upon every one to denounce\r\nall offenders of whom he was cognizant, directly or indirectly.[589]\r\n\r\nAlthough Cerezuela was accused to the Suprema, by his notary Arrieta, as\r\nwholly ignorant of inquisitorial practice, of allowing himself to be\r\neasily influenced, and of neglecting to appoint familiars, he speedily\r\nmanifested an energy inspiring all classes with fear of a tribunal which\r\nwas superior to all distinctions of station, and whose jurisdiction was\r\nlimited only by its own definitions. Scarce had the edict been published\r\nwhen arrests began of bigamists, blasphemers and persons whose\r\nutterances were not cautiously restrained--Alcedo, the fiscal, reports\r\nthree in one day. Two canons of the cathedral and their advocate were\r\nprosecuted for some false swearing before the ecclesiastical court,\r\nwhich the theologians managed to find heretical, and, in spite of the\r\nintervention of the archbishop, Cerezuela tried them and amerced them in\r\neight hundred pesos for the benefit of the tribunal. Then he prosecuted\r\ntwo royal officials, for raising difficulties in supplying his demands\r\nfor the maintenance of poor prisoners, and fined them in eighty\r\nducats.[590] Presumably he desired to produce a profound impression upon\r\nthe public and for this the solemnity of a public auto de fe was\r\nessential. This rendered inadvisable the customary prolonged delays of\r\ninquisitorial action and already, on November 15, 1573, it was held in\r\nthe principal plaza, with the usual oaths administered to all present\r\nand the preaching of a sermon. The different bodies of dignitaries of\r\ncourse quarreled as to the places assigned to them, but Cerezuela\r\nsettled their conflicting pretensions and the awful ceremony was\r\nperformed effectively. The penitents were not numerous. The Corsican,\r\nJoan Bautista, had been penanced for Protestantism by the archbishop and\r\nagain had been sentenced to perpetual prison by the Bishop of los\r\nCharcas; now as an impenitent, he was condemned to two hundred lashes\r\nthrough the streets and to lifelong galley-service. The Frenchman, Jean\r\nde Lion, for the same heresy abjured _de vehementi_, was confined for\r\nten years to the city of Lima, and contributed a thousand pesos towards\r\nthe cost of erecting the staging at the auto. Ynes de los Angeles\r\nreceived a hundred lashes for bigamy, and Andrés de Campos the same for\r\nviolating the secrecy of the Inquisition. The crowning attraction of the\r\nspectacle, however, was another Frenchman, Mathieu Salado, who was\r\ngenerally reputed to be insane. He had been denounced for “Lutheranism”\r\nin May, 1570, but after arrest and examination had been discharged as\r\nirresponsible. New evidence was received however and, in November, 1571,\r\nhe was again put on trial. He held that Erasmus and Luther were saints\r\nenlightened by God; he denounced the popes, the clergy and the whole\r\nestablishment; he denied purgatory and indulgences, images and the mass.\r\nHe was decided to be of sound mind and, as he was pertinacious, he was\r\nsentenced to relaxation after a preliminary torture _in caput alienum_,\r\nall of which was duly executed, but whether he was burnt alive or after\r\nstrangulation we are not informed.[591]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe tribunal which had thus asserted its power was necessarily organized\r\non the Castilian pattern, with normally two inquisitors, a fiscal (or,\r\nas he was termed in later times, an inquisitor-fiscal), a notary or\r\nsecretary, a receiver of confiscations or treasurer, an ornamental\r\nalguazil mayor and another for work, an alcaide or gaoler with\r\nassistants, a nuncio, a portero or apparitor, an advocate of prisoners,\r\na barber, a physician and a surgeon. These were the salaried officials\r\nand in addition there were commissioners at distant points, familiars,\r\nconsultores and calificadores. There seems to have been an effort from\r\nthe first to restrict the lists of unsalaried officials, whose overgrown\r\nnumbers in Spain were the source of constant trouble, owing to their\r\nexemption from the secular courts and being justiciable only by the\r\ntribunal. Thus the consultores were limited to six and the familiars to\r\ntwelve in the city of Lima, four in each cathedral city and one in each\r\ntown inhabited by Spaniards, and their _fuero_ was defined, as in\r\nMexico, to be that of the Castilian concordia of 1553, which limited, to\r\na considerable extent, their exemption in criminal cases.[592]\r\n\r\nDistance and delay in communication necessarily rendered the tribunal\r\nmore independent in action than was permitted in Spain at this time, but\r\nthe Suprema endeavored to maintain supervision and subordination as far\r\nas it could. It was unavoidable that the tribunal should be allowed to\r\nappoint to the minor and unsalaried positions, but its appointments were\r\nreported to the Suprema, which thereupon issued the commissions and\r\nsometimes, at least, made appointments itself. In the original\r\ninstructions of 1570 power was granted to create commissioners and\r\nfamiliars; in 1576 this was extended to notaries and other officials,\r\nwhile in 1589 it appears to be restricted to cases of necessity in the\r\ncity of Lima.[593] Yet when the Suprema chose to exercise the appointing\r\npower it had no hesitation, as when, in 1615, it ordered Don Gil de\r\nAmoraga to be received as commissioner of Panamá and Don Fernando\r\nFrancisco de Ribadeneira as commissioner of Tucuman, if the place was\r\nvacant, and if not, as soon as it should become so. As time went on,\r\ncases of this kind became more frequent. As regards commissions, a\r\nletter of May 26, 1620, orders that the physician, the barber and the\r\nsurgeon are to furnish their proofs of _limpieza_, or purity of blood,\r\nwhen their names can be forwarded and the inquisitor-general will issue\r\ntheir commissions. When, in 1584, the tribunal granted to a familiar of\r\nPanamá the title of alguazil, with a _vara alta de justicia_, or the\r\nprivilege of carrying a tall wand as the symbol of his office, the\r\naudiencia of Panamá complained to the king and the Suprema called upon\r\nthe tribunal for an explanation, pending which the _vara_ was not to be\r\ncarried.[594]\r\n\r\nThe provisions for cases which in Spain were referred to or appealed to\r\nthe Suprema and inquisitor-general have already been detailed in the\r\nchapter on Mexico and need not be repeated here. It will be recalled\r\nthat they conferred on the colonial tribunals almost complete\r\nindependence, so that they escaped the encroachments which at home\r\neventually rendered the provincial Inquisitions scarce more than bureaus\r\nfor the collection of evidence and for the execution of the decrees of\r\nthe Council. The Suprema, it is true, occasionally made its power felt\r\nby sending out a _visitador_ or inspector, with faculties more or less\r\nextensive and by removing or transferring an inquisitor against whom\r\ncomplaints were too vigorous to be disregarded, but the only regular\r\nsupervision that could be exercised lay in the requirement of full\r\nsemi-annual reports of the business of the tribunal and the condition of\r\npending cases. It may be questioned, however, whether this could have\r\nbeen performed with regularity during the earlier periods for, as late\r\nas 1680, the tribunal was notified that an arrangement had been made\r\nwith the king by the consulado of Seville whereby despatches could be\r\nsent twice a year.[595]\r\n\r\nThe Edict of Faith was ordered to be published regularly in all parish\r\nand conventual churches, a command which was doubtless obeyed with\r\nreasonable regularity, but there was a curious ignorance displayed\r\nof the vastness of South America and its lack of means of\r\nintercommunication, when the inquisitors were required to perform an\r\nannual visitation of their district. Of course this instruction received\r\nno attention; indeed the only attempt recorded is that of Inquisitor\r\nUlloa, who found it convenient, in 1594, to be absent from Lima and\r\nemployed his time, until his death in 1597, in wandering over the land\r\nand harassing the people.[596]\r\n\r\nAs in Mexico, Indians were excepted from inquisitorial jurisdiction and,\r\nin matters of faith, were subject to the bishops. This was not relished.\r\nFray Juan de Vivero wrote to Philip that the Inquisition should punish\r\nthem, though not as severely as Spaniards. The notary Arrieta advised\r\nCerezuela to disregard the instructions and to prosecute them, just as\r\nhe had seen in Seville unbaptized slaves punished for perverting their\r\nChristian comrades. Cerezuela reported that baptized Indians publicly\r\npersuaded their fellows that what the missionaries told them was false,\r\nbut the Suprema was firm and ordered him not to interfere even with\r\ndogmatizers who told their people not to believe the missionaries.[597]\r\n\r\nCerezuela’s zeal was also rebuked when he represented that foreigners\r\nwho came to Peru usually sought at once to penetrate into the interior,\r\nwherefore he proposed that the commissioners at Cartagena and Panamá\r\nshould turn them back and not permit them to enter, but the Suprema\r\nreplied that their entrance was not to be impeded nor were they to be\r\nprosecuted unless they committed offences coming within the jurisdiction\r\nof the Holy Office, or were detected in bringing prohibited books. At\r\nthe same time it ordered a careful inquest as to all strangers scattered\r\nthrough the land and, when this should be verified with due secrecy, the\r\ncommissioners were to be instructed to admit to reconciliation those\r\nfound transgressing and, if they refused conversion, they were to be\r\nprosecuted with the full severity of the canons.[598] If the tribunal\r\nthus was prevented from regulating ingress, it assumed full control over\r\negress, for in June, 1584, it issued a proclamation that no one should\r\nleave the kingdom without its licence, under pain of excommunication and\r\nfines, and shipmasters were ordered to take no passengers without it--an\r\nassumption of power which won the approbation of the Suprema, with the\r\nsuggestive warning that the licences must be issued without charge. This\r\narbitrary exercise of authority was even extended to prohibiting any\r\nvessel from leaving port without a licence, and the abuse became so\r\nintolerable that, as we have seen (Mexico, p. 252), its removal formed\r\npart of the Concordia of 1610. The tribunal chafed under this and, when\r\nit was busy in arresting nearly all the Portuguese merchants in 1636, it\r\ncomplained to the Suprema that its hands had been tied; to prevent the\r\nescape of those who might be guilty it had applied to the Viceroy\r\nChinchon who, as a governmental act, ordered that for a year no one\r\nshould be given passage without a licence from the Inquisition; he would\r\nwillingly have done more, but he had to pay some regard to the\r\nConcordia. The Suprema was impressively asked to see that this matter\r\nshould be corrected, as otherwise the faith and the fisc would suffer.\r\nIt was probably on this occasion that occurred a detention of the fleet\r\nwhen ready to sail, to which I have met with an allusion, because\r\nlicences had not been procured for the passengers.[599]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe chief obstacle to the thorough organization of the Inquisition was\r\nthe immense extent of the territory subjected to a single tribunal.\r\nUntil the kingdom of New Granada was cut off, in 1610, by the\r\nestablishment of a tribunal at Cartagena, this comprised the West India\r\nIslands and the whole of South America, save the undefined limits of\r\nPortuguese Brazil.[600] The three centres of Lima, Santiago de Chile and\r\nBuenos Ayres were far apart in distance and still farther in the\r\ncharacter of the intervening territory, much of as yet scarce explored,\r\nthe Indians but partially subdued and the Spanish settlements few and\r\nfar between. Chile, indeed, could be reached by sea, in a voyage usually\r\nof two or three weeks, but the difficulties of communication with the\r\ninterior provinces and those of the River Plate were embarrassing. When\r\nthe tribunal consulted the Suprema about them it could only reply that\r\ncases arising in Paraguay and la Plata must be dealt with as best they\r\ncould; the accused at a distance should be ordered to present themselves\r\nto the tribunal and not be arrested unless there were manifest heresy or\r\nevidence justifying sequestration[601]--a suggestion dictated rather by\r\nthrift than mercy.\r\n\r\nThe device which was effective in Spain, of commissioners in all centres\r\nof population and familiars scattered everywhere, was only a partial\r\nremedy for the difficulty. The power of the commissioner, as we have\r\nseen, was jealously limited; he could execute orders, take testimony and\r\nreport, but he was forbidden to arrest unless there was imminent danger\r\nthat a culprit might fly; in no case could he conduct a trial; his\r\nfunctions were purely executive and in no sense judicial. A vast\r\nproportion of the cases tried by the Inquisition were for offences\r\ncomparatively trivial--blasphemy, careless or irreverent remarks, or the\r\nmore or less harmful superstitions classed as sorcery--and the\r\ntransmission of denunciations for such matters, over hundreds of leagues\r\nof forest and mountain, and awaiting a reply with instructions, was\r\nmanifestly too cumbrous a process to be practical; the half-breed crone,\r\nthe vagrant soldier or the wandering pedlar, who were the usual culprits\r\nin such cases, would be dead or vanished before an order of arrest could\r\nbe received.\r\n\r\nPeru was no more exempt than Mexico from the troubles caused by these\r\noutlying officials who felt themselves virtually independent and became\r\nintolerable pests in their districts. The object of acquiring the\r\nposition was to obtain exemption from justice. They were answerable only\r\nto the tribunal, hundreds of leagues away; if laymen, the secular\r\ncourts, and if ecclesiastics, the spiritual judges, could not touch\r\nthem. They were above all local law; they could indulge with impunity\r\nall evil passions, they could tyrannize at will over their neighbors,\r\nand even in civil matters they could set justice at defiance. It was\r\nidle for the Suprema to urge great care in their selection and strict\r\ninvestigation into their conduct when visitations were made, with\r\nrigorous punishment for their excesses. The material to select from was\r\nnot abundant and was mostly evil; visitations never took place as\r\nplanned, and punishment was rare. The repeated orders not to appoint\r\nfrailes except in case of necessity and, when it was obligatory, to\r\nprefer Dominicans, is not to be regarded as a reflection on the regular\r\nOrders, but as arising from the desire to maintain discipline in the\r\nOrders, because, when a fraile obtained a position in the Inquisition,\r\nhe threw off subjection to his prelate, and the injunction not to\r\nsupport them in disobedience was rarely observed.[602]\r\n\r\nA memorial presented, in 1592, to the inquisitor-general, in the name of\r\nthe clergy of Peru, complains of the appointment as commissioners of\r\nvicious, dishonest and turbulent persons, and confirms it by statements\r\nin detail concerning those of Cuzco, Potosí, Popayan, Camana, Arequipa,\r\nGuaymanga and Payta, while the familiars were no better. Successive\r\ninquisitors, from Cerezuela to Juan de Mañozca, admitted the fact but\r\njustified themselves by the argument that they had to take what they\r\ncould get; the material to select from was too scarce to admit of\r\nselection, with the result that the officials abused their power in\r\ninnumerable ways.[603] The only serious effort made to repress these\r\nevils was when Juan Ruiz de Prado was sent, in 1587, to Lima as\r\n_visitador_, clothed with full power to correct the abuses which had\r\nexcited general complaint. He reported that much of his time was\r\noccupied in prosecuting commissioners and their notaries, who had\r\ncommitted the gravest excesses; the tribunal, while cognizant of their\r\nevil ways, had only taken action in so far as to deprive two of them of\r\ntheir commissions, giving as an excuse that if it punished them it could\r\nfind no others to take their places. Among those whom Prado disciplined\r\nwas the priest Martin Barco de Centinera, commissioner of Cochachamba,\r\nwell known as the author of _La Argentina_. The charges against him were\r\ngrave but Prado did not wish to bring him three hundred leagues to\r\nanswer them, so they were sent to him with orders to return them with\r\nhis defence. It was proved that he treated the people of his district\r\nlike Jews and Moors, that he revenged himself on all who offended him,\r\nand that he usurped the royal jurisdiction. At public banquets he drank\r\nto intoxication, he talked openly of his successful amours, he kept a\r\nmarried woman as a mistress and was generally scandalous in conversation\r\nand mode of life. Prado fined him in two hundred and fifty pesos and\r\nincapacitated him from holding office in the Inquisition.[604]\r\n\r\nA single spasmodic effort such as that of Prado could effect no\r\npermanent result and, if it was difficult for the people, oppressed by\r\nthese petty local despots, to make their wrongs known, it was equally\r\ndifficult for the Lima tribunal to exercise its authority over such vast\r\ndistances. The cruelty and injustice to which this exposed the accused\r\nwere also extreme. On a simple denunciation, possibly for a trivial\r\noffence, and without proper preliminary investigation, he might be sent,\r\nperhaps in chains, from Buenos Ayres to Lima, exhausting in expenses\r\nwhatever fortune he possessed. A practical illustration is furnished by\r\nthe case of Francisco de Benavente, denounced in 1582, to the\r\nCommissioner of Tucuman because, when some one remarked that the Church\r\nwas permanent, he had replied that it was not well said. The\r\ncommissioner commenced to take testimony which so alarmed Benavente that\r\nhe travelled six hundred leagues to present himself to the tribunal in\r\nLima, which suspended the case and he travelled home again.[605] To a\r\ngreat extent this explains the inordinate procrastination in many of the\r\ntrials, while the victim languished in his cell, for the evidence might\r\nhave to be sent back for ratification, or fresh testimony might be\r\nsought and when, after years had been consumed in these preliminaries,\r\nhe put in his defence, the interrogatories for his witnesses would be\r\ndespatched over the same distance and their return would be awaited.\r\nThese causes of delay were aggravated by the habitual negligence and\r\nindifference of all the officials concerned, so that a large portion of\r\na man’s life was often consumed in prison for an offence which\r\nultimately might only merit a reprimand, or for which he might be\r\nacquitted.\r\n\r\nSome relief was afforded when, in 1611, the tribunal of Cartagena was\r\nfounded for the northern coastal territory and the islands. This was\r\nprobably intended as the commencement of a systematic subdivision of the\r\nvast district for, a few years later, in anticipation of the erection of\r\nthe bishopric of Buenos Ayres in 1620, the Suprema presented to Philip\r\nIII an elaborate consulta strongly urging the establishment there of a\r\ntribunal. It pointed out that the arrests made in Lima showed the\r\ncountry to be full of Portuguese Judaizers, who had every facility of\r\nentrance and departure at Buenos Ayres. From there to Lima there were\r\nseven hundred leagues; the roads were good, the country populous and the\r\nPortuguese drove a thriving trade, enriching themselves and perverting\r\nthe Indian converts. A commissioner would not answer, for he had to send\r\nseven hundred leagues to Lima, with as many in return, before he could\r\nact, while a tribunal could take note of every passenger landing or\r\ndeparting, and not only defend the faith but avert the political dangers\r\nthreatened by the correspondence of these foreigners with the enemy.\r\nBesides, it was a great hardship when a man, for a slight offence such\r\nas blasphemy, had to be taken under guard for seven hundred leagues, at\r\ngreat cost, to be sentenced perhaps to abjure _de levi_ and to hear a\r\nmass. If the projected cathedral were founded a prebend could be taken\r\nto diminish the expense and a single inquisitor would suffice, as in\r\nMajorca.[606]\r\n\r\nGiven the necessity for the Inquisition, the arguments were\r\nunanswerable, but they elicited no response for the crown was\r\nimpoverished and shrank from having to support another tribunal. About\r\n1620 another effort was made by the procurator of the Atlantic\r\nprovinces, in a memorial repeating the same arguments and suggesting\r\nthat a district be formed of Rio de la Plata, Paraguay and Tucuman up to\r\nthe boundaries of los Charcas, thus extending some three hundred leagues\r\nand leaving four hundred for the Lima tribunal.[607] This was referred\r\nto the Suprema which presented a consulta urging favorable action\r\nFebruary 1, 1621, but the illness and speedy death of Philip III\r\nintervened and on March 31, 1623, it applied again to Philip IV,\r\nsupporting its arguments with letters from the tribunal of Lima and the\r\ncommissioner at Buenos Ayres, but to no effect. The next move came from\r\nthe king, who, on April 12, 1630, communicated to the Suprema a paper\r\ndescribing how the Dutch lost no opportunity of introducing heretical\r\nbooks and perverting the natives of those regions. He thought it would\r\nbe well to found an Inquisition in Buenos Ayres and, if the expenses\r\nwere too great, there might be an inquisitor and a fiscal, while the\r\nother offices could be filled by wealthy men who would gladly serve\r\ngratuitously. Or, if this were too costly, a Dominican fraile could fill\r\nthe post of inquisitor as in Naples and other parts of Italy, and he\r\nordered the Suprema to arrange the matter accordingly. We shall see that\r\nin Peru, as in Mexico, the tribunal and Suprema evaded all efforts to\r\nrelieve the royal treasury of the burden and can scarce wonder that\r\nPhilip, with all his fanaticism, was economically disposed, but this did\r\nnot suit the ideas of the Suprema. It replied in a consulta of April\r\n17th, insisting that an inquisitor, fiscal, notary, alcaide and portero,\r\nwith salaries and expenses aggregating at least six thousand ducats a\r\nyear, were indispensable. The other officials, whose time would not be\r\nexclusively occupied, might be selected from among opulent persons, and\r\nthat by aiding to suppress the contraband trade of the Dutch the royal\r\nrevenues could be correspondingly increased. The prospect of this outlay\r\nrefrigerated Philip’s zeal, and he returned the consulta with the\r\nendorsement that the disadvantages prevented the execution of the\r\nproject; the Lima tribunal must appoint a commissioner of special\r\nability and the governor would be ordered to assist him.[608]\r\n\r\nThis rebuff silenced the Suprema for the time but, on September 19,\r\n1630, it returned to the charge. The Lima tribunal, in a letter of June\r\n28, 1629, had related how a soldier in the port of Buenos Ayres, on the\r\nlook-out for a vessel, had picked up on the shore a sealed package\r\naddressed “A las justicias del Perú” and on opening found it full of\r\nattacks on the papal and monarchical authority. This showed, it said,\r\nthe audacity with which the heretics were disseminating their doctrines\r\nin those regions. They were also circulating tracts which had been\r\nseized, one of which was enclosed to prove to the king the necessity of\r\nordering efficacious support to the Inquisition by the royal officials,\r\nand how desirable ii would be to establish a tribunal at Buenos\r\nAyres.[609] This appeal likewise fell on deaf ears and, on November 26,\r\n1636, the Suprema forwarded to Lima the king’s reply with corresponding\r\ninstructions.[610]\r\n\r\nThe suggestion was renewed, March 1, 1636, by the fiscal of the\r\nAudiencia of la Plata, but this time the proposed seat of the tribunal\r\nwas in Tucuman. This led the king, November 2, 1638, to ask for\r\ninformation from the audiencia, the viceroy and other authorities. To\r\nthis the President of Charcas replied, warmly approving of the project,\r\nbut for a wholly different reason, saying that during his years of\r\nservice he had observed the great oppression of the people by the\r\ncommissioners, maltreating them on trivial pretexts, ordering them to\r\nappear at Lima with excessive cost and irreparable disgrace and\r\nmolesting them in many ways, for which they dared not seek redress, for\r\nit lay at such a distance and the remedy was to them so horrible. The\r\naudiencia answered, March 10, 1640, recommending Córdoba de Tucuman as\r\nthe most desirable seat. Two inquisitors and a fiscal, with salaries of\r\ntwo thousand pesos and a secretary with one thousand would suffice and\r\nwould be largely defrayed by the fines and confiscations. Viceroy\r\nChinchon delayed responding until September 29, 1641, when he said that\r\nit would be advantageous but costly; the salaries would have to be\r\nlarge, for living was dear, and the confiscations would be insufficient;\r\nin the last auto, although the culprits were many and of much reputed\r\nwealth, the property had almost wholly disappeared. Chinchon’s\r\nsuccessor, the Marquis of Mancera, had already written, June 8, 1641,\r\nthat Chinchon had handed the matter over to him; he had referred it to\r\nthe President of Chuquisaca, whose report he enclosed, and he dwelt upon\r\nthe evil of the Portuguese who entered Paraguay by San Pablo and spread\r\nover the land.[611]\r\n\r\nBy this time the Portuguese and Catalan revolts gave Philip ample\r\noccupation, and the absolute exhaustion of the treasury forbade all\r\nthoughts of incurring avoidable expenses. When these pressing\r\nnecessities diminished, the suggestion was renewed in 1662; the erection\r\nof an audiencia in the growing city of Buenos Ayres led the Lima\r\ntribunal to urge the establishment of an Inquisition there or in Córdoba\r\nde Tucuman. Communication with Spain was easy from there and two\r\ninquisitors would suffice, or one and a fiscal. The Suprema warmly\r\nadvocated the measure, but favored Córdoba, which was only eight days’\r\njourney, or even only five, from Buenos Ayres. The failure of this\r\neffort seems to have discouraged further official attempts and we hear\r\nnothing more of the matter for nearly a century. In 1754 the Jesuit\r\nPedro de Arroyo wrote to the procurador of his province in Spain,\r\ncalling attention to the necessities of an additional tribunal. That of\r\nLima was so far off--a thousand leagues, he said--that it was of no use\r\nto them. In the twenty years spent in those provinces, he had never\r\nheard of an arrest by the Inquisition except one in Buenos Ayres, and\r\nthen the prisoner escaped before reaching Lima; there was, however, a\r\ncase of a cleric of Paraguay who spontaneously obeyed a summons to Lima.\r\nA commissioner had told him that, in ten or eleven years, he had had ten\r\nor eleven cases, which he had investigated and reported to Lima, but had\r\nnever had a reply, except in the first case and this was not until two\r\nyears had elapsed, by which time the culprit had disappeared. A second\r\ntribunal was now more necessary than ever, as the Portuguese were\r\ninundating the land. In the jurisdiction of Buenos Ayres they were said\r\nto number six thousand, and there was the same proportion in other\r\ndistricts; in that of Córdoba, the audiencia banished them some years\r\nago, but they merely moved their residence and their places were taken\r\nby other Portuguese. About the same time Pedro de Logu, a calificador in\r\nBuenos Ayres, called attention to the mischief to religion arising from\r\nthe scum collected there and subjected to no supervision; the powers of\r\nthe commissioner were limited, he had no profit from his work and the\r\nintroduction of prohibited books was frequent. These unofficial\r\nrepresentations seem to have elicited no attention, but more\r\nauthoritative was the memorial, in 1765, of Pedro Miguel, Archbishop of\r\nla Plata, whose residence there for twenty years had shown to him the\r\nnecessity of a tribunal in Buenos Ayres. To this the fiscal of the\r\nCouncil of Indies replied, December 13, 1766, with an indifference which\r\nforms the measure of inquisitorial decadence. The rarity, he says, of\r\ncases of faith, attributable to the care exercised in preventing the\r\nimmigration of descendants of infected persons, rendered it unnecessary\r\nto burden the fisc with the expenses of another tribunal; besides, the\r\ndifficulty of reaching Lima restored to the bishops their inherent\r\njurisdiction in such matters and they could sufficiently protect the\r\nfaith.[612] It may be hoped, for the good archbishop’s peace of mind,\r\nthat he did not avail himself of this unofficial authorization to set up\r\nan episcopal Inquisition.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt may be gathered from these ineffectual efforts to multiply tribunals\r\nthat the financial question was as important in South America as we have\r\nseen it in Mexico. The experiences of the two Inquisitions were similar.\r\nWhen Cerezuela and his colleague went to Lima, they bore instructions to\r\nthe royal officials to disburse to the receiver of confiscations ten\r\nthousand pesos a year for the salaries of the two inquisitors, the\r\nfiscal and the notary.[613] This made no provision for other inevitable\r\nexpenses. The theory on which the Holy Office was based was that it\r\nshould be self-sustaining--supported by the fines and confiscations\r\nwhich it inflicted--and that when these were in excess the surplus\r\nshould enure to the royal fisc. In Lima, more clearly than in Mexico,\r\nPhilip defined repeatedly that this royal subvention should continue\r\nonly as long as there was deficiency from other sources of income. In\r\nthe quarrels which speedily arose between the tribunal and the viceroy,\r\nToledo kept it in some sort of subjection by making the inquisitors\r\napply to him personally for their salaries. This was highly distasteful,\r\nand they seem to have endeavored to escape from it by excommunicating\r\nthe royal officials who declined to honor their demands, for cédulas of\r\nJuly 17 and 27, 1572, addressed to the viceroy and inquisitors,\r\nprohibited them from drawing on the royal treasury and enforcing payment\r\nwith censures; they were to hand in their accounts which were to be\r\npromptly paid, until the fines and penances and confiscations should\r\nsuffice. If this meant that they should render accounts of these other\r\nsources of income, it received no attention. In Lima as in Mexico no\r\neffort on the part of the government could obtain an insight into the\r\nfinances of the tribunal and the royal subvention was indefinitely\r\nprolonged.[614]\r\n\r\nStill this did not provide for the salaries of the minor officials and\r\nthe other unavoidable expenses. For awhile doubtless the tribunal felt\r\nthe pinch of poverty. We find the Suprema suggesting that, if the\r\nprisons are insufficient, they can be made good out of the fines and\r\npenances; the alguacil is to be dismissed and, if another is appointed,\r\nhe must serve without salary; possibly the viceroy may be induced to\r\ngrant pensions on some of the vacant _repartimientos_ of Indians. The\r\ntribunal astutely raised the question of the _ayuda de costa_, or\r\nsupplementary payment to meet the expenses of the visitations, which it\r\nhad no intention of making, and it was told to consult the viceroy and\r\nreport, after which the Suprema would consult the king. In this it\r\ndoubtless failed, but we chance to hear of an ayuda de costa paid as a\r\nreward for the auto de fe of 1578. Philip was by no means disposed to be\r\nliberal. In 1593 a question arose as to the salary of a fiscal _ad\r\ninterim_ and he rather grudgingly, by a cédula of February 7, 1594,\r\nordered that one-half might be paid, until the confiscations should\r\nsuffice.[615]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the activity of the tribunal was rapidly enabling it to emerge\r\nfrom its penury. Its correspondence with the Suprema between 1570 and\r\n1594 shows that confiscations were continually decreed and were\r\napparently profitable. Frequent references occur to the estate of a Dr.\r\nQuiñones, who owned a mine which was to be rented until sentence was\r\npronounced and then was to be sold; he also had a library which seems to\r\nhave been of value and was to be disposed of either in bulk or at\r\nretail. Up to 1583 the total receipts from confiscations amounted to\r\nthirty-eight thousand pesos, or an average of nearly three thousand per\r\nannum.[616] Fines were also lucrative. Between 1571 and 1573 there were\r\ntwenty-seven cases sentenced in the audience-chamber, yielding in all\r\ntwenty-six hundred pesos of which a thousand were levied on Rodrigo de\r\nArcas, parish priest of Ribera, for solicitation in the confessional.\r\nBetween 1581 and 1585 fifty-seven cases, similarly sentenced in private,\r\nfurnished eighty-three hundred pesos. In 1583 there came a piece of good\r\nfortune in a legacy of Pedro de la Peña, Bishop of Quito, who left to\r\nthe tribunal twenty thousand pesos to build a chapel for his interment.\r\nThe house and prison thus far occupied were unfitted for the growing\r\nactivity of the tribunal; with the legacy and the proceeds of sale of\r\nthe existing building, a much finer structure was erected, including a\r\nprison with twelve cells. With increasing business came increasing\r\nincome and, while the pretext of poverty continued to be put forward to\r\nthe king, the tribunal soon began to accumulate capital and place it at\r\ninterest. In 1596, Inquisitor Ordoñez, while blaming the receiver Juan\r\nde Saracho, admitted that he had succeeded in amassing twenty thousand\r\npesos, part of which sum was invested in censos or ground-rents. To this\r\nOrdoñez, by a happy stroke, added seven thousand more from the estate of\r\nPedro González de Montalban, whose property had been sequestrated. He\r\nwas very sick and obtained his liberation by making a will in favor of\r\nthe tribunal.[617] The Portuguese Judaizers now began to occupy a\r\nconstantly increasing share of the tribunal’s attention, opening up a\r\nmost prosperous field of operations. The time had come when the\r\ntemporary subvention should be withdrawn, but the tribunal continued\r\nquietly to demand and receive it.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to keep wholly secret the absorption of large estates\r\nand the investments of accumulating capital. The attention of Philip III\r\nwas called to the matter and, in a letter of June 4, 1614, to the\r\nviceroy, he recited the conditions on which the grant had been made; he\r\nhad learned that the salaries continued to be paid by the treasury, in\r\nspite of the receipt from these sources of amounts sufficient to defray\r\nthem in whole or in part, and he therefore ordered that, when the\r\nsalaries were paid, the viceroy should inform himself of the receipts\r\nfrom other sources and deduct them from the charge on the treasury,\r\nmaking full reports to the king. This was evaded by the receiver giving\r\na certificate such as he saw fit, of what moneys he had on hand, which\r\nnaturally was found to be a worthless safe-guard, and the viceroy was\r\nordered to require from the receiver a statement of all receipts every\r\nyear. It was found impossible to procure this and Philip, in a letter to\r\nthe Viceroy Squillace, April 26, 1618, after recalling all the previous\r\nattempts, ordered him to appoint from the treasury two experienced\r\naccountants to audit the receiver’s accounts and report the result to\r\nthe king. The accountants were duly appointed, but the receiver refused\r\nabsolutely to exhibit his accounts--he had sent them to the\r\ninquisitor-general as he was required to do by his instructions. This\r\nexhausted the royal patience and one of the first acts of Philip IV was\r\na letter to the viceroy, June 11, 1621, ordering the suspension of\r\npayments until the inquisitors should furnish authentic evidence that\r\nthe confiscations had not sufficed to meet them. This went on for two\r\nyears, the inquisitors preferring to forego the subvention rather than\r\nto expose the flourishing condition of their finances. They brought\r\nincessant pressure to bear, however, and finally induced Viceroy\r\nGuadalsacar, under a resolution of the treasury officials, to resume\r\npayments on the presentation of certain certificates of the contador,\r\nthe scrivener of sequestrations and the receiver. On learning this the\r\nCouncil of Indies made a thorough investigation of the whole matter and\r\nreported that, in view of the exhaustion of the royal treasury, and that\r\nsince the foundation of the tribunal, up to 1625, it had consumed six\r\nhundred and sixty-two thousand ducats without having returned anything\r\nfrom the fines and confiscations, it was wholly wrong that the money\r\nshould have been used by the officials in buying lands and censos which\r\nthey were now enjoying. To put an end to this the king, April 20, 1629,\r\nissued a cédula ordering that the conditions expressed in 1621 should\r\nbe inviolably observed, no matter what might be the exigency, under\r\npain not only of the royal displeasure but that all such disbursements\r\nshould be charged to the viceroy and be deducted from his salary. To\r\ninsure observance this cédula was to be entered on the books of the\r\ntreasury and all auditors were to be governed by it.[618]\r\n\r\nThese were brave words but it is probable that the Inquisition found\r\nmeans to render them nugatory, while an apparent compromise was sought\r\nat the expense of a third party--the Church. We have seen (Mexico, p.\r\n216) how a prebend in each cathedral was suppressed at the first vacancy\r\nand the fruits were paid to the tribunal. The process was necessarily\r\nslow, commencing with the brief of Urban VIII, March 10, 1627, and\r\ndelayed by waiting for the successive vacancies and also by resistance,\r\nin some cases, of the cathedral chapters.[619] It was virtually\r\ncompleted in 1635, when Philip wrote to the treasury officials,\r\nSeptember 26th, that the senior Inquisitor, Juan de Mañozca, had advised\r\nhim that the suppression of the prebends for the payment of salaries had\r\nbeen effected. The orders with regard to this are to be executed and, as\r\nhe supposes that the arrearages of salaries have been paid, he writes to\r\nMañozca that in future the prebends are to be applied to the salaries as\r\nthe treasury is in urgent need of relief--which shows that up to that\r\ntime the king had continued to pay them and even to make good the\r\narrearages, in spite of the decisive provisions of 1629.[620] The\r\nprebends thus obtained were eight in number, in the cathedrals of Lima,\r\nQuito, Trugillo, Arequipa, Cuzco, Paz, Chuquisaca and Santiago de Chile.\r\nThey produced, as we have seen, eleven thousand pesos a year, thus more\r\nthan replacing the subvention. Further documents fail us here but, from\r\nthe experience of Mexico and Cartagena, it is fairly to be assumed that,\r\nin spite of the prebends and of the large confiscations now coming in,\r\nthe tribunal managed to continue drawing the subvention and, in 1677,\r\nthere was still discussion of the subject.[621]\r\n\r\nThe time, in fact, had come when the finances of the tribunal were to be\r\nplaced on an enduring foundation. We shall see hereafter the details of\r\nthe _complicidad grande_, when nearly all the leading merchants in Lima,\r\nof Portuguese extraction, were arrested on charges of Judaism and their\r\nproperty was sequestrated. Arrests had commenced in 1634 and the tragedy\r\nculminated in the great auto of January 23, 1639. What was the amount\r\nacquired by the tribunal can never be known, but popular report\r\nestimated it as a million of pesos, and we have seen that Viceroy\r\nChinchon reported that it virtually disappeared without any one knowing\r\nwhere it went. Philip IV, whose necessities were daily becoming\r\ngreater, was led by the report of the enormous sequestrations to seek an\r\nexplanation of the Suprema, which replied to him, December 19, 1636,\r\nthat the sequestrations had been large but they shrank to almost nothing\r\nfrom the claims of creditors, some of which came from Spain.[622]\r\nDisappointed in this he wrote, March 30, 1637, congratulating the\r\ninquisitors on their zeal and suggesting that it appeared to him just\r\nthat out of them the fisc should be reimbursed for its outlays on their\r\nsalaries, and that enough should be set aside to provide for the future\r\nin case the prebends did not suffice. The inquisitors replied, with\r\noutward demonstrations of respect, that they would report to the Suprema\r\nto which the funds belonged; that as yet there had only been\r\nsequestrations, while innumerable claims on the property had been\r\npresented, and that many prisoners had been found innocent and their\r\nestates had been restored to them--to five of these, Pedro de Soria,\r\nAndrés Muñoz, Francisco Sotelo, Antonio de los Santos and Jorje Danila\r\nthere had thus been returned a hundred and seventy-four thousand pesos.\r\nPhilip made an attempt to investigate the matter by appointing, in 1643,\r\nwith the assent of the Suprema, Dr. Martin Real as visitador to examine\r\ninto the finances of the tribunals of Lima and Cartagena, but, as we\r\nshall see, he was baffled in Cartagena and, after stormy experiences,\r\nreturned to Spain without reaching Lima.[623] Repulsed thus at every\r\npoint, Philip resorted to somewhat arbitrary measures. In 1644 we find\r\nthe Suprema complaining of the seizure at Seville of two or three large\r\nsequestrations sent there from Lima for settlement with creditors, and\r\nagain of twenty thousand ducats’ worth of wool taken by him, of which\r\nAlfonso Cardosso & Co. were demanding the surrender as owners.[624]\r\n\r\nWhat share of the spoils the Suprema obtained it would be impossible to\r\nsay. We happen to hear, in 1640, of twelve thousand pesos brought to it\r\nfrom Lima by Juan de Arostegui, which is doubtless only a portion of the\r\namount doled out to it by the tribunal.[625] The latter, in fact, in\r\nits reports habitually belittled the results obtained or anticipated; it\r\ntreated the Suprema as the Suprema treated the king. In reporting the\r\narrests, in 1636, it was careful to point out that, although the\r\nprisoners were reputed to be wealthy and lived with ostentation, it was\r\na deception, for in reality they were trading on borrowed money and had\r\nlittle of their own. This was a repetition of what it had said in 1631,\r\nwhen persecution of the Portuguese had already been going on for some\r\nyears--the sequestrations made much show but with slender results; the\r\nreal estate of the accused was held in order to gain the reputation of\r\nwealth, while in reality it was so encumbered as to be valueless, and\r\nthe personal property was so concealed as to be undiscoverable.[626]\r\n\r\nThere were other productive sources of income besides the confiscations.\r\nOne of these which was especially profitable was the “quebrantamientos\r\nde escrituras de juego.” Gambling was almost universal and disgusted\r\ngamesters would frequently swear off under a penalty, attested by a\r\nnotarial act; the pledge would inevitably be broken and the forfeit was\r\nusually contributed to the pious uses of the Inquisition. A statement of\r\nthe deposits in the _arca de tres llaves_, or money-chest of the\r\ntribunal, from May 4, 1630, to August 31, 1634, shows 1449 pesos from\r\nfines, 4909 from donations and 35,829 from the _quebrantamientos_, or in\r\nall 42,187, representing an annual income of nearly nine thousand pesos\r\nfrom these sources alone.[627] When to this we add the confiscations,\r\nthe prebends and the constantly increasing returns from accumulating\r\ninvestments, it will be seen that the tribunal was rapidly growing in\r\nwealth and how factitious were the pleas on which it maintained its grip\r\non the royal subvention.\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1631, the office of alguazil was made saleable considerable\r\nsums were collected from this source. In 1641 the position of alguazil\r\nmayor of Santiago de Chile--a purely ornamental office, unsalaried but\r\nwith contingent privileges--was bid up to 6500 pesos.[628] As these\r\ncommissions, however, were issued by the inquisitor-general it is\r\nprobable that they were duly accounted for. Indeed, we have seen (p.\r\n224) that the Suprema endeavored in this way to explain the remittances\r\nwhich it could not conceal.\r\n\r\nIncreasing wealth naturally led to multiplication of offices and\r\ngenerally careless expenditure. In 1674 the receiver or treasurer\r\nlamented that he had striven in vain to reduce the affairs of the\r\ntribunal to order. The revenues had fallen to 35,951 pesos and the\r\nexpenses exceeded them. Still, he held that, in spite of the\r\nconsiderable remittances to the Suprema and the overgrown payroll, the\r\nincome could be made to suffice if it were not for the expenditures of\r\nthe inquisitors on their houses and their frequent elevation to\r\nbishoprics, after which they persisted in drawing their salaries.[629]\r\n\r\nThe investments of the tribunal were principally in censos--rent-charges\r\non real estate. When these fell into arrears the property was put up and\r\nsold at auction, apparently still subject to the rent, the arrearages\r\nbeing collected from the purchase-money, and the numerous references to\r\nthese transactions show that they were by no means infrequent. Still,\r\nthe Inquisition assumed that it was an indulgent creditor. When, about\r\n1705, several successive bad harvests had rendered the farmers unable to\r\npay their rents, they petitioned the viceroy for a reduction of the\r\nprincipal. In transmitting this request to the king, the viceroy asked\r\nthe opinion of the various tribunals, to which the Inquisition replied\r\nthat the principal should remain intact as the deficient harvests were\r\ntemporary and the land retained its value: that it was different in\r\nChile, where the censos on urban property were reduced in principal\r\nafter the earthquake which ruined the buildings. The tribunal therefore\r\nrecommended a postponement of arrears and reduction of interest until\r\nthe bad season should pass; this was what it had done with its debtors;\r\nit had not thrown them in prison or put up the farms at auction, even\r\nthough the arrears were large, proceeding with benignity and equity and\r\ntreating each case on its merits.[630]\r\n\r\nUnder a succession of venal and unprincipled inquisitors, the finances\r\nof the tribunal became involved in confusion and the magnitude of the\r\namounts at stake shows how successful it had been in accumulation. In\r\n1733 the two inquisitors were Gaspar Ibañez de Peralta and Christóbal\r\nSánchez Calderon. The former was old and failing and the latter was\r\nengaged, under the name of his chaplain, in mercantile operations with\r\nthe funds of the tribunal with such success that, in 1739, he remitted\r\neighty thousand pesos to Spain and had purchased a valuable property\r\nnear Lima. He also spent five thousand in decorating his house, and when\r\nthe security of the temporary receiver Juan Estéban Peña expired he\r\nopposed its renewal, resulting in heavy loss when Peña became bankrupt.\r\nThe new receiver, Manuel de Ilarduy speedily fell into default for more\r\nthan two hundred and thirty thousand pesos and there were other\r\ndeficiencies. In 1735 Diego de Unda was sent from Spain as fiscal with\r\nspecial orders to investigate the finances. In 1736 he reported that he\r\nfound everything right except that when Calderon insisted that Ilarduy\r\nshould render his accounts and deposit all funds in the chest and on the\r\nreceiver’s refusal, had embargoed his property, Ibañez verbally\r\nsuspended the embargo, so that when, on the next day, the embargo was\r\nrenewed, it was found that large amounts of silver and merchandise had\r\nbeen removed and there only remained a little silver dish and some\r\nvessels in his oratory. Still Ilarduy was forced to pay fifty thousand\r\npesos and furnish securities amounting to a hundred and ten thousand\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nIt seemed impossible to secure honest officials. Unda had brought with\r\nhim as secretary of the tribunal Ignacio de Irazábal, who was made\r\nauditor. He was detected in passing false accounts for Ilarduy and was\r\ndismissed, as likewise was another secretary, Gerónimo de la Torre. The\r\nstruggle between Calderon and Ilarduy became mortal, and the amounts at\r\nstake must have been large for the latter sent emissaries to Spain with\r\na hundred thousand pesos with which to bribe the Suprema to dismiss the\r\ninquisitor. He succeeded in having a visitador sent with full powers to\r\ninvestigate and punish, with results that we shall see hereafter. It is\r\nonly necessary here to say that Calderon’s and Unda’s property was\r\nsequestrated, to be released in 1747 by orders of the Suprema. A new\r\nfactor had appeared on the scene when, in 1737, Mateo de Amusquíbar came\r\nas fiscal, to be not long afterwards promoted to the inquisitorship. He\r\nformed an alliance with Ilarduy; they were both Biscayans and the\r\nBiscayan faction became supreme. Unda died, May 27, 1748, and Calderon\r\nwas living in retirement on his plantation. The vacancy was filled, in\r\n1751 by Diego Rodríguez Delgado who came with special orders to\r\ninvestigate the finances. He promptly reported that it was impossible to\r\nexamine the accounts of the receiver, which were in a state too confused\r\nto admit of verification. He had learned that the cost of maintaining\r\nthe prisoners did not amount to more than a thousand pesos per annum,\r\nwhile it was charged at four thousand. There were seventy thousand due\r\non the rents of farms and fruits of prebends and, by the reduction of\r\nexorbitant salaries this amount when collected could readily be\r\nincreased to a hundred thousand, more than enough to rebuild the\r\ninquisition and its chapel, which had lain in ruins since the earthquake\r\nof 1746. Under the preceding receiver, the confiscation of Pedro Uban,\r\ncondemned in 1736, had amounted to more than sixty thousand pesos, but\r\nno trace could be found of the existence or the expenditure of this sum.\r\nNo reform however was possible in view of the alliance between\r\nAmusquíbar and Ilarduy. No reform, in fact, followed, although after all\r\nthe actors had passed away, Calderon’s property was seized to make good\r\nthe deficit of Antonio Morante, an administrador whom he had appointed\r\nand kept in office without requiring security and, in 1773, a suit was\r\nin progress with the executor of his estate for over thirty thousand\r\npesos, the outcome of which the records fail to inform us. Altogether,\r\nthrough these quarrels we obtain an inside view of venality and\r\ncorruption which probably were not confined to this period. In 1751 we\r\nlearn that Amusquíbar, on entering office in 1744, had remitted nineteen\r\nthousand pesos to the Suprema, since when nothing had been sent. The\r\nincome had fallen to thirty thousand and there was little more than\r\nforty thousand in the chest.[631]\r\n\r\nThe inevitable results of dishonesty and disorder were heightened by\r\nexternal causes and, in 1777, we find the resources of the tribunal\r\nmaterially reduced. After the earthquake of 1746 the rate of interest on\r\nthe censos had been lowered from five per cent. to three. There were few\r\nprofitable confiscations to make good the deficit, the fruits of the\r\nprebends were falling off and their collection was becoming difficult.\r\nIn 1777 that of Quito owed about ten thousand pesos, that of Trujillo\r\neleven thousand, that of Arequipa, owing to the decline in prices was\r\ngreatly diminished in value. Salaries were in arrears to the extent of\r\ntwenty thousand pesos and the efforts of the receiver to make\r\ncollections were fruitless. The houses of the inquisitors were\r\nunfinished and Inquisitor Lopez Grillo was obliged to rent one, at the\r\ndistance of a block from the tribunal. In 1784 the earthquake in Cuzco\r\ncaused a further decline in the canonries of la Paz, Arequipa and Cuzco;\r\nan urgent request was made for the suppression of the office of the\r\nthird inquisitor, and authority was asked to sell property in order to\r\npay salaries.[632] All this betokens real distress and yet, although the\r\nadministration of affairs can scarce be thought to have improved in the\r\nfollowing years, when, in 1813, the decree of suppression was received\r\nin Lima and the property of the tribunal was inventoried for the benefit\r\nof the royal treasury, there were found in its chests ready money to the\r\namount of 68,834 pesos, 3-1/4 reales, besides 2400 pesos of jewels\r\nconfiscated on Inquisitor Unda and 2500, the valuation of the furniture\r\nof the chapel. From the statement of the auditor it appeared that the\r\ncapital of the censos and value of the plantations belonging to the\r\ntribunal amounted to 1,508,518 pesos. A portion of this, however, was\r\nnot its property but was held in trust for special purposes. Of the\r\nmoney on hand, 47,433 pesos were funds of the tribunal, while 13,325\r\npesos, 2 reales appertained to the Colegio de Santa Cruz, founded by\r\nMateo Pastor de Velasco and Bernardino Olave for female foundlings, and\r\nplaced under the charge of the Inquisition, also 8076 pesos, 1-1/4\r\nreales was the balance on hand of a foundation known as of Zelayeta and\r\nNuñez de Santiago. The capital of the Colegio de Santa Cruz amounted to\r\n394,502 pesos, 6-1/2 reales; that of the other foundation is not stated\r\nbut, assuming them together to be 500,000 pesos, it would leave about a\r\nmillion for the accumulations of the tribunal.[633]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe men who were at the head of the tribunal, whatever may have been\r\ntheir reputation at home, were not, as a rule, able to resist the\r\ndemoralizing influences around them, intensified by the irresponsible\r\nautocratic power conferred by their position. The only effective control\r\npossible to the Suprema lay in the appointment of a visitador or\r\ninspector, clothed with superior authority, and this was an expedient\r\nrarely resorted to, especially as the inspector was exposed to the same\r\ntemptations and was apt to yield to them. The Suprema was not kept in\r\nignorance of the derelictions of its appointees, for the inquisitors\r\nrarely worked in harmony. Deadly quarrels arose between them and they\r\nabused each other without stint in their communications to headquarters,\r\nwhile their subordinates were equally free in exposing the malfeasance\r\nof their superiors. The publication of much of this secret\r\ncorrespondence and of complaints of aggrieved parties by Señor Medina\r\nthus gives us an exceptional opportunity to gain an insight into the\r\ninterior life of a tribunal and into its use of the enormous power which\r\nit enjoyed.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the second inquisitor, Bustamente, died at Panamá, and\r\nthat Cerezuela was alone in opening the tribunal. The fiscal, Alcedo,\r\nand the notary, Arrieta, were quarrelling mortally with each other, and\r\nboth were writing to the Suprema, criticizing Cerezuela’s inexperience\r\nand lack of self-assertion, and asking that the new inquisitor to be\r\nsent should be a man of greater force. Their wishes were gratified when\r\nAntonio Gutiérrez de Ulloa arrived, March 31, 1571. It was not long\r\nbefore his arbitrary and scandalous conduct aroused indignation, but\r\nthose who dared to complain were made to suffer. Secret information,\r\nhowever, was conveyed to the Suprema and the viceroy, the Count del\r\nVillar, was unreserved in his communications to the king, representing\r\nthat Ulloa kept spies in the viceregal palace, who carried off papers\r\nand documents and that he had indirectly farmed the quicksilver mines\r\nof Guancavelica, making large sums to the detriment of the royal\r\ninterests. A cleric named Gaspar Zapata de Mendoza, as representative of\r\nthe clergy of Peru, after several vain attempts, managed to escape to\r\nBrazil; he was captured by the French and carried to Dieppe, whence he\r\nmade his way to Spain, but it was not until 1592 that he was able to\r\npresent in Toledo a memorial to Inquisitor-general Quiroga in which the\r\nconduct of Ulloa was set forth in detail. His promiscuous amours with\r\nmaids and married women were notorious; he publicly kept as a concubine\r\nCatalina Morejon, a married woman, who used her influence to dictate\r\nappointments and modify sentences until, after repeated efforts, Villar\r\nsucceeded in banishing her. On one occasion a husband found him in bed\r\nwith his wife; Ulloa threatened him as inquisitor and he slunk away;\r\nanother husband was less timid, he killed the wife and chased the\r\nadulterer through the streets. He was in the habit of walking the\r\nstreets at night dressed as a cavalier, brawling and fighting, and on\r\none Holy Thursday he supped with a number of strumpets. He and the\r\nDominican Provincial, Fray Francisco de Valderrama, each had as mistress\r\na relative of the other; when the three years of the provincialate\r\nended, Valderrama aspired to be prior of the Lima convent, but the new\r\nProvincial, Agustin Montes, refused to appoint him because he was a\r\nbastard, whereupon Ulloa went to the convent, thrust a dagger to the\r\nprovincial’s breast and swore he would kill him, when Montes yielded. He\r\nwas involved in perpetual contests with the judges and royal officials,\r\nwhom he treated without ceremony or justice, interfering with their\r\nfunctions, of which a number of cases were given which, if not\r\nexaggerated, show that the land was at the mercy of the inquisitorial\r\nofficials, who murdered, robbed and took women at their pleasure, and\r\nany who complained were fined or kept chained in prison. The limitations\r\nof the fuero enjoyed by the ministers of the Holy Office were\r\ndisregarded and no one could obtain justice against them.[634]\r\n\r\nBefore this black catalogue of crime reached the Suprema, the complaints\r\nhad shown that some interference was necessary, and it had sent as\r\nvisitador Juan Ruiz de Prado, who reached Lima February 11, 1587. He had\r\nfull authority to prosecute any members of the tribunal and to send them\r\nwith the evidence to Spain for judgement, but those who anticipated\r\nrelief were disappointed. As Villar writes, he took up his residence\r\nwith Ulloa, and his officials were lodged with those of the tribunal,\r\nwho made much of them. He made no secret that he came to take care of\r\nUlloa’s honor, so that all complainants were frightened off. Villar had\r\nhis special grievances which show how impossible was efficient\r\ngovernment, when a power existed within the state superior to the state\r\nitself. News was received that two ships had sailed from England for the\r\nPacific; two Englishmen, John Drake, cousin of the famous Sir Francis,\r\nand Richard Farrel, who had been wrecked in the River Plate, had been\r\nsent to the Inquisition, as was the fashion with heretic prisoners; the\r\nviceroy desired to examine them to learn, if possible, something about\r\nthe threatened corsairs and he asked the inquisitors to send the men to\r\nhim or, if that was not possible, to allow one of his officers to\r\nexamine them, or again, if that was impossible, to examine them\r\nthemselves and communicate to him what they could learn; Ulloa was\r\nwilling but Prado refused, saying that he would communicate with the\r\nSuprema who could inform the king, thus postponing for a year the\r\ninformation wanted at the moment. Then there came an alarm about some\r\nEnglish ships on the coast, and Villar ordered all who were liable to\r\nmilitary service to be in readiness to defend Callao. Ulloa and Prado\r\nassumed that their officials and familiars would fulfil their duty by\r\nguarding the buildings of the Inquisition, and gave instructions not to\r\nobey the viceroy’s orders, who vainly pointed out to them that, in\r\ndefending the city, their men would be defending the Inquisition. At the\r\nauto of 1587 they virtually took possession of the city, treated the\r\nviceroy as a private person subject to their orders, and grossly\r\nhumiliated him, to all of which he submitted for the sake of peace.\r\nThey meddled in everything, and with their unlimited power of\r\nexcommunication and fines, no one dared to resist them. They summoned\r\nhis secretaries before them and forced them to reveal everything, even\r\nof the most confidential character, and to produce official papers, of\r\nwhich they retained copies. They appointed royal officials as familiars,\r\nthus releasing them from all responsibility to the viceroy, to the\r\ncourts and to their superiors. Villar declared himself helpless to\r\nremedy all this unless the king would interfere.[635]\r\n\r\nThe memorial of Mendoza tells the same story of the alliance between the\r\nvisitador and the inquisitor, and mentions a case of a priest named\r\nHernan Gutiérrez de Ulloa, who had lent a considerable sum to Inquisitor\r\nUlloa and being unable to obtain repayment had procured a papal brief\r\nagainst him. Prado took the brief from him, fined him heavily, suspended\r\nhim for a year from his benefice and sentenced him to four years’\r\nreclusion, the result being that he died under the persecution.[636]\r\n\r\nThe evil friendship between these men did not last long and, in January,\r\n1588, Prado commenced the real duties of his office. He overhauled all\r\nthe proceedings of the tribunal since its foundation, examining 1265\r\ndocuments, his notes on which covered 1650 pages and fully substantiated\r\nhis conclusions as to its irregular methods, its cruel delays, and its\r\ninflicting public penances for matters not of faith and beyond its\r\njurisdiction. He reported that he had drawn up 216 charges against\r\nUlloa, many of them applicable also to Cerezuela. There were six about\r\nhis relations with women, involving much publicity and scandal, and\r\nthere would have been more had he cared to investigate further in this\r\ndirection. He said that Ulloa had accumulated considerable sums which he\r\nsent to Spain; he was virtually the farmer of the quicksilver mines of\r\nGuancavelica, for when bids were invited he frightened off all bidders\r\nexcept his brother and an accomplice, who obtained the contract for\r\ntwenty or thirty thousand pesos less than others were ready to offer. He\r\nkept around him a band of disreputable creatures, who ministered to his\r\nvices and were above the law. No one could collect debts of them, for\r\nwhen suit was brought he would order it discontinued and he was obeyed.\r\nWhen he was sole inquisitor he used to go hunting for a fortnight at a\r\ntime, leaving the accused in prison and delaying their cases. Sometimes\r\nhe took with him a certain mestizo who had a quarrel with another\r\nmestizo and was prosecuted in the royal court. Ulloa demanded the case,\r\nclaiming that the defendant was his servant; the court demurred as the\r\nman was not _de familia_ but only an occasional employee, whereupon he\r\nexcommunicated the judge and all the alcaldes; they surrendered the case\r\nwhich was settled before him for eight pesos.[637]\r\n\r\nWhen Prado presented the 216 charges, Ulloa quietly allowed a year to\r\nelapse before undertaking to answer them. Prado seems to have been in no\r\nhurry. Four years had been spent in the visit and the Suprema had\r\nrepeatedly ordered his return, which he answered by alleging Ulloa’s\r\nrepeated absences, sometimes for months together, during which he could\r\nnot leave the tribunal; then he gave sickness as an excuse, or that he\r\nhad not a real with which to pay for the voyage. Finally he sent the\r\npapers by the secretary, Martínez de Marcolaeta, who started from Callao\r\nMay 6, 1592, and reached Spain the same year. After this Ulloa no longer\r\nkept terms with him and ordered him to leave the tribunal, which he\r\nrefused to do. Ulloa then denounced him to the Suprema, pointing out\r\nthat he could have sailed at any departure of the fleets but that he\r\ndesired to remain because he was in partnership with an Augustinian\r\nfraile, Francisco de Figueroa, whom he appointed commissioner at\r\nTrujillo and then at Potosí, where they made twenty-five thousand pesos.\r\nUlloa publicly spoke of him in terms too opprobrious for any lackey to\r\nendure, and the fiscal, Arpide, joined in accusing him of unlawful\r\ngains, in granting licences to leave the country, and of protecting\r\nunworthy persons by appointing them as familiars. The Suprema attributed\r\nthe quarrel to the close friendship which Prado had formed for a Dr.\r\nSalinas, a man of notoriously bad character, whom he had made advocate\r\nof prisoners and then of the fisc, in which capacity he had his suits\r\nbrought before the tribunal, to the wronging of third parties.[638]\r\n\r\nFinally the orders of the Suprema became so pressing that Prado was\r\nobliged to leave Lima, April 14, 1594, Ulloa managing so that he\r\nreceived no salary for his return. From Havana he sent a report of his\r\nvisit, which was approved, not without some rebuke. Of the 216 charges\r\nagainst Ulloa, 118 were accepted and, by sentence of December 15, 1594,\r\nhe was suspended for five years, fined and ordered to present himself\r\nbefore the inquisitor-general for reprimand--a sentence suggestive of\r\nthe customary indulgence shown to official malfeasance. Prado also\r\nproposed thirty-one articles of reform, the most important of which was\r\nthe deprivation of the fuero, in criminal cases, of familiars and\r\nservants of commissioners; subordinates of the tribunal were to have\r\nregular salaries so as to remove the temptation of accepting bribes, and\r\nthere were many other suggestions for improving the operation of the\r\ntribunal, diminishing injustice and relieving the people from abusive\r\nextortions. The Suprema approved of all this and directed Prado to\r\nreturn to Lima and put the reform into execution, but, when these orders\r\nreached Havana, Prado had sailed for Spain; he did not get back to Lima\r\nuntil 1596, by which time Ulloa had escaped his sentence by dying and\r\nthere is little trace of any reform by Prado, who died January 18,\r\n1599.[639]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the vacant inquisitorship had been filled by the arrival,\r\nFebruary 4, 1594, of the Licentiate Antonio Ordóñez y Flóres. Ulloa at\r\nonce announced his intention of visiting the district, which he carried\r\nout in spite of his colleague’s protest to delay until he should have\r\nfamiliarized himself with the business of the tribunal. Ulloa traversed\r\nthe land spreading terror wherever he went by the indulgence of his\r\npassions. A memorial to the inquisitor-general, from a gentleman named\r\nDiego Vanegas, son of a judge of the Contratacion of Seville, affords an\r\nillustration of the reckless abuses possible under such institutions.\r\nWhen Ulloa, on his way to Charcas, stopped at Cuzco and lodged in the\r\nhouse of Francisco de Loaysa, a servant of the latter came where Vanegas\r\nand some friends were talking in the public square, and began boasting\r\nof the powers of the inquisitor which were the greatest on earth; there\r\nwas, he said, the Licentiate Parra who had some words with a servant of\r\nUlloa, in consequence of which he was arrested; Ulloa called him a dog\r\nof a Jew, an _ensambenitado_, with other insults and threw him in\r\nprison. Vanegas remarked that they did not wish to hear anything more\r\nabout it, and for this he was seized and carried before Ulloa who called\r\nhim a scoundrel, an Indian, a dog and other opprobrious epithets. Then\r\nsummoning his servants, about twenty persons rushed in whom he told to\r\nkill the rascal. One of them gave him a severe cut on the head while the\r\nrest pummelled him. Doña Mariana, wife of the host, entered and\r\ninterceded for him; Ulloa declared that he was going to give him five\r\nhundred lashes, but on her entreaty he diminished it to three hundred,\r\nthen to two hundred and finally consented to send him to the corregidor\r\nwith orders to banish him. Ulloa left Cuzco the next day but, hearing on\r\nthe road that Vanegas had said that he would go to Spain to complain, he\r\nsent back orders to seize him. Vanegas was taken from his bed where he\r\nwas recovering from his wounds, was thrown in prison in chains and the\r\nnext day was carried to Siguana where Ulloa swore him on the cross, made\r\nhim sign a paper without reading it and carried him to Potosí, where he\r\nlay chained in prison for four months. Thence he was sent two hundred\r\nleagues to Santa Cruz de la Sierra, as a soldier condemned to serve for\r\nthree years on the frontier or in the galleys. Then he was returned in\r\nchains through Potosí to Misque, being wounded in an attempt to escape.\r\nCarried fifty leagues farther, still in chains, he effected his escape\r\nand, after many perils in four hundred leagues of travel, he reached\r\nLima, where he reported to the viceroy and with his permission and that\r\nof Ordóñez he was allowed to sail for Spain to present his\r\ncomplaint.[640]\r\n\r\nUlloa continued his so-called visitation in this fashion until orders\r\ncame in October, 1596, to Cepeda, President of the Audiencia of la\r\nPlata, to notify him that his commission would terminate in four months.\r\nHe appealed to the viceroy who told him that he must obey it, and Cepeda\r\nordered him to leave Potosí. He refused, alleging his health, but the\r\ncorregidor, Alonso Osorio, communicated to him a further order of the\r\nAudiencia, requiring him to do so in ten days. He still pleaded\r\nsickness, but Osorio arrested him and all his servants and, after three\r\ndays, ejected him from the city. He reached Lima, July 7, 1597, and died\r\nsix days later at the age of 63. He attributed his disgrace to the\r\nreport of a visitador of the Audiencia of Lima that he and his brother,\r\nwhom he had made alguazil of the tribunal, had embezzled some three\r\nhundred thousand pesos.[641] If there were even partial truth in the\r\nstatement the plea of the poverty of the tribunal can be understood.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Ordóñez had commenced his official career by letting it be\r\nknown that all who had claims to collect within the district of the\r\nInquisition could assign them to him, and they would divide the\r\nproceeds. This was an open invitation to the commission of fraud,\r\nresulting, as the secretary reported, in converting the Holy Office into\r\na business office. He also took money from the chest--at one time as\r\nmuch as ten thousand pesos--which he confided to a merchant to trade for\r\nhim in Mexico. Before the year was out, the receiver and the secretary\r\nwere making bitter complaints of him to the Suprema--he was young,\r\ninexperienced, violent tempered and abusive. Those who came voluntarily\r\nto the tribunal to discharge their consciences were so ill-treated that\r\nthey declared they would rather go to hell. He would order the secretary\r\nto alter the evidence and, if a witness remonstrated, he would be\r\nabused and threatened. On his part he wrote equally unfavorable accounts\r\nof his subordinates; he knew that they assailed him but he ascribed this\r\nto the friends of Ulloa and Prado.[642]\r\n\r\nWhether the Suprema believed these accusations or not, Ordóñez was not\r\ndisturbed and continued to be sole inquisitor, with the exception of the\r\nbrief second term of Prado from 1596 to 1599, until the arrival of\r\nFrancisco Verdugo, a new inquisitor, towards the close of 1601. He was a\r\nman of different type, who had been advocate in the tribunal of Seville\r\nand fiscal in that of Murcia. While a strenuous persecutor of heresy, he\r\nwas not inclined to abuse his office and he shortly reported to the\r\nSuprema that they had suspended a hundred _informaciones_--cases in\r\npreparation--which were without sufficient proof or were matters that\r\ndid not concern the Holy Office. Ordóñez continued in office until 1612,\r\nwhen he became Archbishop of the Nuevo Reino de Granada, a promotion\r\nthat was not to his taste, as he complained that the revenues of the see\r\nwere insufficient for his decent support. Doubtless it afforded fewer\r\nopportunities than the inquisitorship.[643]\r\n\r\nHis successor, Andrés Juan Gaitan reached Lima, October 12, 1611; he had\r\nbeen fiscal of the tribunals of Cuenca and Seville and was therefore\r\nexperienced in the work. About the same time Panamá, New Granada and the\r\nAntilles were detached from the tribunal of Lima on the founding of that\r\nof Cartagena.[644] In October, 1623, Verdugo left Lima to occupy the see\r\nof Guamanga, to which he had been promoted. For several years he and\r\nGaitan had been on such bad terms that they would not speak to each\r\nother, and Gaitan had moreover quarrelled with the Viceroy Guadalcázar,\r\nwho had resumed a certain repartimiento of Indians that he had granted\r\nto the inquisitor. His enforcement, moreover, of the royal orders about\r\nthe payment of salaries was bitterly resented by the officials and\r\nintensified the embroilment. The vacancy left by Verdugo was soon filled\r\nby Juan de Mañozca who, after founding the tribunal of Cartagena, was\r\nsent as visitador of the Audiencia of Quito and, in place of going\r\nthere directly, came to Lima and occupied the position of inquisitor _ad\r\ninterim_ much to Gaitan’s disgust. He reported to the Suprema that the\r\ncondition of the tribunal was deplorable; unless some action was taken\r\nthere would be no Inquisition, but only a gang of men obeying a will the\r\nmost obdurate and most terrible that he had ever met, under which the\r\ntribunal was diverted from its proper functions to serve Gaitan’s\r\ninterest or caprices, for good or for ill. There was nothing with which\r\nhe did not interfere, and that with such violence that he offended all\r\ngood men, and even his own faction followed him rather through force\r\nthan willingly. The fiscal was a coward; it was a pity to pay their\r\nsalaries for they did nothing but impair the authority of the Holy\r\nOffice.[645]\r\n\r\nIn October, 1625, Juan Gutiérrez Flóres arrived to take Verdugo’s place.\r\nIn consequence of Mañozca’s representations he was ordered to make a\r\nsecret report, which was equally unfavorable. Gaitan, he said,\r\ncontrolled the tribunal absolutely and supported all the claims of the\r\nofficials without regard to justice. This was thoroughly understood by\r\nthe people, and we can readily imagine the oppression and terrorism\r\nwhich afflicted the community. Flóres died, September 22, 1631; and the\r\ntribunal was reinforced by the appointment of Juan de Mañozca and\r\nAntonio de Castro y del Castillo. Gaitan continued to serve for some\r\nyears, though infirm with age and sickness, accused to the last of\r\nabusing his position for gain.[646] There soon followed the Portuguese\r\n_complicidad grande_, of which more hereafter, and this, with the\r\ncomplications of the resultant confiscations, for years afforded the\r\ntribunal abundant occupation more or less legitimate. With its\r\nconsequent enrichment there came torpidity and for many years it did\r\nlittle work and its annals are bare. In June, 1688, there came as\r\ninquisitor Francisco de Valera, transferred from the tribunal of\r\nCartagena, in order to restore peace to that city, disturbed, as we\r\nshall see hereafter, by a prolonged conflict between him and the bishop,\r\nBenavides y Piedrola. This transfer [Greek:]had been arranged for 1685,\r\nbut he had delayed obedience, awaiting the arrival of a successor and,\r\non reaching Lima, he was met with a command from the Suprema to return\r\nto Spain, which he evaded on the ground that this would leave but a\r\nsingle inquisitor. He paid no attention to a royal cédula of April 1,\r\n1691, ordering Viceroy Monclova to send him at once to Spain without\r\nlistening to excuses, but this was to be expected, for royal commands\r\nwere not obeyed by inquisitors unless they were transmitted by the\r\nSuprema. Finally the latter ordered his jubilation or retirement on\r\nhalf-pay--the usual punishment of inquisitors whose offences were too\r\nflagrant to be overlooked. This reached Lima in 1703, when the tribunal\r\nsubmissively answered that it would obey the command with due\r\nexactitude, but that Valera had died on the previous second day of\r\nAugust.[647]\r\n\r\nValera had imparted some vigor to the tribunal and had held public autos\r\nin 1693 and 1694, but there was not another until 1733. His death had\r\nseriously crippled the tribunal, for his colleague Burrelo had died in\r\n1701, the third inquisitor Suárez was old and disabled by asthma, and\r\nthe fiscal, Ponte y Andrade, was so prostrated with gout that, for\r\ntwenty-two months prior to November, 1704, he could not venture out of\r\ndoors. By this time the civil business of the tribunal was greater than\r\nthat of the royal Audiencia and it necessarily fell into confusion,\r\nwhile matters of faith were neglected. Suárez asked the Suprema for help\r\nand it was rendered after the customary fashion, for the fiscal Ponte\r\nwas appointed inquisitor and an old professor of law, who had sought the\r\npriesthood, Gaspar Ibañez, was made fiscal. Quarrels arose immediately,\r\nfor Ibañez received his commission by private hand and was sworn in\r\nimmediately, while that of Ponte came by the galleons. Suárez, who was a\r\nfriend of Ibañez, endeavored to enforce the latter’s seniority, which\r\ncarried with it considerable emoluments, and this was resisted by Ponte.\r\nBy this time there was no distinction of grade between inquisitor and\r\nfiscal; the latter had the title of inquisitor-fiscal, and the\r\nfunctions were interchangeable, although no one could perform both--that\r\nis of prosecutor and judge--in any given case. Ponte, in 1707, exhaled\r\nhis griefs to the Suprema; his colleagues, he said, acted irregularly;\r\nIbañez assumed to be both fiscal and inquisitor in the same case; the\r\nsituation was desperate and the civil business was at a standstill.[648]\r\n\r\nFor more than a quarter of a century there was no improvement. Slender\r\nas was the business of the tribunal in matters of faith, it was greatly\r\nin arrears. Ibañez, who had become senior inquisitor, was sometimes\r\nunable to sit for three months at a time. Holidays, beyond those on the\r\nregister, were taken until they amounted to half the days in the year.\r\nGutiérrez de Cevallos, one of the inquisitors, on being made Bishop of\r\nTucuman, in 1730, reported to the Suprema that he had been unable to\r\nexpedite matters; there were prisoners who had been confined for\r\nthirteen years, of which eleven had passed since he had, as fiscal,\r\npresented the formal accusations--and we shall see that six more were to\r\nelapse before these dreary trials came to an end in the\r\n_quemadero_.[649]\r\n\r\nIbañez finally fell into dotage. Sánchez Calderon had become his\r\ncolleague and Diego de Unda came as fiscal in 1735, to be rated as\r\ninquisitor when Mateo de Amusquíbar, in 1737, assumed the former\r\nposition, to be in turn made inquisitor, in 1744, when he had attained\r\nthe age of thirty, which was the minimum for that office. Allusion has\r\nbeen made above to the quarrels over the mismanagement of the finances\r\nby the receiver Ilarduy, with whom Amusquíbar formed an alliance.\r\nAmusquíbar wrote to the Suprema most damaging reports as to his\r\ncolleagues; the irregularities committed in serious trials for heresy\r\nand the monstrous contradictions in civil cases. Unda, he said, acceded\r\nto all that Calderon did, and Calderon followed his own whims in\r\nopposition to the precise orders of the Suprema, while the same\r\ndisregard of instructions was shown in appointments and in dismissals\r\nfrom office. There had, indeed, been gross irregularities in the trial\r\nculminating in the great auto of December 23, 1736, in which a woman\r\nand two effigies had been relaxed. One of the effigies was that of a\r\nJesuit Padre, Juan Francisco de Ulloa, who had died in 1710 with a\r\nreputation of sanctity; the Jesuits had made great efforts to avert it\r\nand were deeply incensed at the disgrace inflicted on the Society. This\r\nmay perhaps aid to explain why, when Calderon and Unda sent their\r\nofficial relation of the cases, the Suprema had replied that it felt the\r\ngreatest sorrow and scandal in seeing how the affairs of religion were\r\ntreated, in offence both of religion and justice, and of the honor of\r\nthe Holy Office, with the threat that, if in future the laws were not\r\nobserved, the inquisitors would be dismissed. Calderon and Unda,\r\nmoreover, were greatly discredited by their amours. They kept as\r\nconcubines two sisters, Magdalena and Bartola Romo, the daughters of the\r\nalcaide of the prison. Magdalena had three daughters whom Calderon\r\neducated in the monastery of las Catalinas, where they were known as\r\n_las inquisidoras_. Romo was an accomplice of Ilarduy, but when Calderon\r\nand Unda dismissed others who were compromised, they retained him on\r\naccount of their relations with his daughters.[650]\r\n\r\nThese scandals and Calderon’s commercial enterprises were weapons used\r\nby Ilarduy who, as we have seen, sent to Spain emissaries with a hundred\r\nthousand pesos to accomplish Calderon’s downfall. One of these, Felipe\r\nde Altolaguirre, Ilarduy’s son-in-law, before his departure, openly\r\nboasted that he would not return without securing Calderon’s dismissal,\r\nand after he came back he publicly spoke of having bribed the\r\ninquisitor-general and Suprema, while Ilarduy said that it had cost him\r\nforty thousand pesos.[651] What was attained was the appointment of a\r\nvisitador, armed with supreme powers. The person selected was Pedro\r\nAntonio de Arenaza, inquisitor of Valencia, who was promised a salary of\r\nfourteen thousand pesos and perquisites. If Calderon is to be believed,\r\nAltolaguirre, the envoy of Ilarduy, told him that there were rich\r\npickings to be had from the fines to be imposed on the inquisitors; that\r\nhe could make large profits from merchandise which he could carry with\r\nhim; that he would have the appointment of corregidores in Piura and el\r\nCercado, yielding him thirty-six thousand pesos; that his travelling\r\nexpenses would be paid and that, on his return to Spain, he could not\r\nget a seat in the Suprema unless he took with him a hundred thousand\r\npesos.[652] His experience in Madrid had evidently familiarized him with\r\nthe depth of corruption existing there.\r\n\r\nThe impression conveyed by this is confirmed by the commercial aspect of\r\nthe visitador’s voyage, strangely at variance with its object of\r\nreforming abuses. To escape the risk of English cruisers, Altolaguirre\r\nand Arenaza sailed from Lisbon to Rio, the visitador taking with him a\r\nlarge assortment of goods and some negro slaves for sale. Rio was\r\nreached in the middle of 1744 and Buenos Ayres in November, whence they\r\npassed to Santiago and arrived in Lima early in March, 1745. On March\r\n15th Arenaza presented his credentials and at once examined the funds in\r\nthe chest. Two weeks later, when Unda went to the chapel as usual to\r\nhear mass, Arenaza’s notary told him to go to Amusquíbar’s house. As he\r\nwas about to enter, the notary made him get into a carriage standing at\r\nthe door, when, accompanied by a secretary, he was carried to the\r\nFranciscan convent in the neighboring village of la Magdalena, with\r\norders to speak to no one. His property was at once embargoed, his house\r\nlocked up and placed under guard.\r\n\r\nCalderon was arrested in even more unceremonious fashion. He had been\r\nsick in bed for three days when Yrazabal, the alguazil mayor, who had\r\nbeen reinstated, penetrated to his apartments. His physician and\r\nchaplain, who were with him, were dismissed and an order was read\r\nsuspending him from office, embargoing his property and ordering his\r\ndeparture for Limatamba. Yrazabal collected all the keys, and at once\r\ncommenced an inventory which consumed two days. Calderon remained in bed\r\nunder guard, with orders to speak to no one and no one was allowed to\r\nleave the premises. The next day he was sent, in Amusquíbar’s coach, to\r\nLimatamba, where two Dominicans were ready to guard him and, on May 3,\r\nhe was carried to Guaura. For a month there was busy search for the\r\nsequestrated property. Calderon declared that it consisted mostly of\r\ndeposits confided to him, and he says that he was offered reinstatement\r\nand the withdrawal of the visitation, if he would give security for\r\nfifty thousand pesos and Unda for twenty thousand.[653]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Arenaza was openly retailing his negroes and his goods,\r\nthrough his secretary Gabiria, in rooms obligingly placed at his\r\ndisposal by the Jesuits in their college. Ilarduy collected for him the\r\nproceeds and the traffic was so successful that Arenaza was speedily\r\nable to remit to Spain forty thousand four hundred pesos. The friendly\r\nassistance of the Jesuits was due not only to their rancor against\r\nCalderon, but also to their desire to shield one of their members, whose\r\narrest had been ordered and evaded by hurrying him away and procuring\r\nthe arrest of another party in his place. They were Arenaza’s advisers\r\nand Calderon’s transfer to the secret prison had been determined\r\nwhen an unlooked-for event changed the aspect of affairs. The\r\nInquisitor-general, Manrique de Lara, died January 10, 1746, and was\r\nsucceeded, July 26th, by Pardo y Cuesta. Calderon received the news by\r\nway of Potosí and claimed that Arenaza’s commission expired with the\r\ngrantor. He hastened to Lima where he recused Arenaza as his judge,\r\nthreatened to shoot him and asked the Count of Superunda, then viceroy,\r\nto give him no support. Superunda was strongly in favor of Arenaza and\r\nordered Calderon to leave the city within ten hours, nor does it need\r\nCalderon’s accusation that he was bribed to this by the Jesuits.\r\nArenaza, in a letter to his brother, asserts that Calderon attempted to\r\nbuy him off and, when this failed, threatened him, but he would gain\r\nnothing by this “for I am resolved rather to be fried in a frying-pan in\r\nthe public plaza.”[654]\r\n\r\nCalderon’s faction in the city had been active in discrediting Arenaza\r\nwith pamphlets, lampoons and caricatures. The viceroy stood by him,\r\nholding that his commission emanated from the Suprema and had not\r\nlapsed, but still he sought to effect a settlement. At one time it was\r\nagreed that the inquisitors should resume their offices and the\r\nsequestrations be lifted, on their giving security in fifty thousand\r\npesos to answer judicially to the charges but, from some cause, the\r\narrangement fell through. Then came the great earthquake of October 28,\r\n1746, followed by pestilence, which, for a time, suspended all action.\r\nCalderon had his agents at work with the Suprema, which resolved, in\r\nApril, 1747, that the inquisitors should be restored and the\r\nsequestration be lifted; that Arenaza’s functions should be limited to\r\nthe subordinate officials, and that the viceroy should select some one\r\nto replace him as respected the inquisitors. It was nearly a year before\r\nthese orders reached Peru, but, on March 4, 1748, Calderon and Unda\r\nentered the city triumphantly, in coaches escorted by a crowd of negroes\r\nand mulattos, with bands of music and scattering of flowers, while the\r\nbells of the convents of which they were patrons sounded a joyous peal,\r\nthe demonstration continuing for two days.\r\n\r\nArenaza was humiliated and, when Superunda received a commission in\r\nblank for a new visitador, the warning was quite sufficient to deter any\r\ncompetent person from accepting the perilous position. All to whom it\r\nwas offered declined, pointing out the fate of Arenaza and the danger of\r\narousing enmities that would blast their honor and reputation. Superunda\r\ntherefore brought Arenaza and the inquisitors together and, after a long\r\nconference, it was agreed that the sequestration should be lifted and\r\nthat they would sit with Arenaza in the tribunal, but they failed to\r\ncomply with their promise and the business was carried on by Arenaza and\r\nAmusquíbar. Unda died, May 27, 1748, of apoplexy following a visit paid\r\nto a house where he had illicit relations with the daughters. His\r\nfuneral was dismal, even Calderon refusing to be present, saying that he\r\nhad died as he had lived.\r\n\r\nSuperunda reported to the inquisitor-general that affairs were beyond\r\nremedy by a continuance of the visitation, and Arenaza was ordered to\r\nreturn to Spain. This order reached Lima at the close of 1750 and he\r\nsailed from Callao August 11, 1751, complaining bitterly that his salary\r\nof fourteen thousand pesos had been cut down to fifty-nine hundred.\r\nAmusquíbar, however, states that he was paid in addition eighteen\r\nthousand five hundred for his outward expenses and living and eight\r\nthousand for those of his return, which conflicts with the statement of\r\nViceroy Superunda that he embarked wholly destitute of money. He died on\r\nthe passage at Cartagena, but his secretary went on to Spain with the\r\npapers of the visitation.\r\n\r\nThe decision of the Suprema had suspended Calderon until he should\r\nanswer judicially the charges made against him, and he consequently\r\nlived in retirement, while the tribunal was carried on by Amusquíbar and\r\nRodríguez Delgado, who had been sent out to replace Unda. As usual they\r\nquarrelled and, in 1754, Amusquíbar formally demanded that his colleague\r\nshould be removed by promotion to the episcopate, for he was inquisitor\r\nonly in name, being utterly inefficient and incapable. Rodríguez, on his\r\nside, described Amusquíbar as arbitrary and impenetrably obstinate; a\r\ncase had been ready for final sentence for a year, yet he could not be\r\nbrought to agree as to its settlement. The sudden death of Rodríguez,\r\nhowever, October 31, 1756, restored peace and José de Salazar y\r\nCevallos, who was appointed in his place, died in November, 1757, before\r\nhe could assume possession, so that Amusquíbar remained sole inquisitor.\r\nHe paid so little attention to his duties that in five months he was\r\nonly three times in the audience-chamber and, on the plea of illness, he\r\nabsented himself from Lima and appointed as his representative the\r\nfiscal, Bartolomé Lopez Grillo, an act which excited much adverse\r\ncomment.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile nothing was heard as to the dealings of the Suprema with the\r\npapers of the visitation. They seem to have been gone over with even\r\nmore than customary deliberation and we chance to learn that, in 1762,\r\nCalderon was charged with improper conduct of the cases of Bartolomé\r\nCortez de Umansoro and Andrés de Muguruza. In 1763 the Suprema adopted\r\nthe expedient of sending to the Viceroy Armat y Yuniant blank\r\ncommissions by which to appoint two competent ecclesiastics who with\r\nAmusquíbar should form the court to try the charges. The instructions\r\nreached Lima in 1764, by which time both Calderon and Amusquíbar had\r\npassed away and thus, some twenty years after its inception, the\r\nvisitation died a natural death, every one concerned in it having passed\r\nto a higher jurisdiction.[655]\r\n\r\nA paralysis had fallen on the tribunal and from this time its functions\r\nalmost ceased, although its organization was kept complete and its\r\npay-roll suffered no diminution. One of its last autos was held in 1773,\r\nin which only eight penitents appeared. Possibly this torpidity only\r\nrendered its official positions more attractive, for they came to be a\r\nmatter of almost open bargain and sale. In 1789, Cristóbal de Cos, chief\r\nclerk in the secretariat of the Suprema, commenced to traffic in them\r\nthrough his agent, Fernando Piélago, one of the secretaries of the Lima\r\ntribunal. To save the expense of transportation, the Suprema had for\r\nsome time adopted the practice of appointing natives or residents of\r\nPeru, which may have given rise to the sale of offices or may, perhaps,\r\nonly have rendered it notorious, for Cos could not have transacted the\r\nbusiness without the connivance and participation of his superiors.\r\nPiélago himself had paid three thousand pesos for his position, and\r\nManuel de Vado Calderon the same, for the office of secretary of\r\nsequestrations. Narciso de Aragon gave six hundred for a minor position\r\nand three cases are mentioned in which sums were paid for jubilation, or\r\nretirement on half-pay, with the privilege of appointing a successor.\r\nThe culmination was reached in the career of Pedro Zalduegui, who\r\ncommenced as sweeper and sacristan of the chapel of the tribunal. He was\r\nwholly illiterate, but he was a shrewd trader and he paid the capellan\r\nmayor of the tribunal a thousand pesos to surrender his place to him.\r\nFinally, through Piélago and Cos, he bought the position of inquisitor\r\nfor the sum of fourteen thousand ducats; there was little concealment in\r\nthe transaction and the scandal was great. The Suprema was obliged to\r\norder an investigation which it confided to the Inquisitors Abarca and\r\nMatienzo. In a letter of November 8, 1794, they confirmed the reports as\r\nto the sale of offices and the incompetence of those who bought them.\r\nAgainst this Zalduegui, in 1796, defended himself, by asserting that the\r\ntrouble arose from his refusal to join with his colleagues in their\r\nmismanagement of the affairs of the tribunal for their private\r\ninterests. At length he manifested his gross ignorance in a controversy\r\nwith Bartolomé Guerrero on the intricate question of sanctifying grace;\r\nthey obliged him to define his position and, on the strength of the\r\ndoctrinal error involved, they prosecuted him and suspended him from\r\noffice. That the Suprema restored him is fairly suggestive of another\r\npayment and he retained his office till the last.[656]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nInquisitors of the character thus indicated, owning no superior save the\r\ndistant inquisitor-general and Suprema, armed with the terrible power of\r\nexcommunication which none but themselves could remove, judging all and\r\njudged by none, could not fail to be a disturbing element in the\r\ncolonial administration. They were at the head of a body of officials\r\nand familiars, scattered over the land, who enjoyed exemption from all\r\nother jurisdiction, secular and ecclesiastical, and who were sure,\r\nwhatever crimes they might commit, to find protection and mercy in the\r\ntribunal. Even their servants and slaves had the benefit of this _fuero_\r\nand formed a peculiarly obnoxious class in the community. The\r\nmaintenance and extension of these privileges involved the tribunal in\r\nconstant strife with the authorities, lay and spiritual, quarrels which\r\nwere carried on with a violence frequently destructive to the public\r\npeace. The governmental officials, however high-placed, who sought to\r\ncurb inquisitorial arrogance, could have slender hope of support from\r\ntheir royal master. As we have seen in the chapter on Mexico, there was\r\npreserved in the Madrid archives the formula of a letter addressed to\r\nviceroys, insisting on their subservience to the Inquisition. This in\r\n1603 was duly sent to the Marquis of Monterey, Viceroy of Peru.[657] How\r\noften this was repeated it would be impossible to say, but in 1655, at\r\nleast, it was sent to the Count of Alba by Philip IV, as a warning in\r\nconsequence of some squabbles in which he came to be involved with the\r\ntribunal.[658] When the colonial Inquisitions were founded, Philip II,\r\nby a cédula of August 16, 1570, took the inquisitors and all the\r\nofficials under the royal protection and decreed that any one, no matter\r\nof what rank, who disturbed or injured them should incur the penalty of\r\nviolating the safeguard, and this was repeated by Philip III in\r\n1610.[659]\r\n\r\nFrancisco de Toledo, the first viceroy who had to deal with the\r\nInquisition, was a man of decided character who, by holding the\r\npurse-strings, managed to keep within bounds Cerezuela, who was of a\r\nyielding disposition. There was dissension however, for which Alonso de\r\nArceo, canon of la Plata, decried him as a heretic and a forger, whom\r\nthe tribunal dared not accuse, but when Toledo asked it to prosecute\r\nhim, it evaded the request.[660] The next viceroy, the Count del Villar,\r\nwas weaker, while Ulloa, as we have seen, enforced the prerogatives of\r\nthe Holy Office with a masterful hand. The quarrels which arose were\r\nlong and intricate and were conducted in a way to abase thoroughly the\r\nvice-regal authority. We have seen that Villar banished Catalina Morejon\r\nto put an end to the scandal of her relations with Inquisitor Ulloa;\r\nthis may have been either the cause or a result of the ill-feeling\r\nbetween them, but motives for dissension could not be lacking, when the\r\ndomineering spirit of the tribunal refused obedience to all constituted\r\nauthority, and could always frame some excuse for asserting its superior\r\njurisdiction.\r\n\r\nMay 30, 1587, the English made a descent on Payta, where they burnt some\r\nchurches and convents and desecrated some images. They had been piloted\r\ninto the port by Gerónimo de Rivas, an inhabitant of Payta, whom they\r\nhad captured at sea and who remained after their departure. The deputy\r\ncorregidor naturally arrested him and Villar ordered him to be sent by\r\nland to Lima for examination. In some way the inquisitorial\r\ncommissioner, the Mercenarian Fray Pedro Martínez, was interested in him\r\nand to save him claimed and obtained him from the corregidor as a fautor\r\nof heretics, justiciable by the Inquisition. He was forwarded by sea to\r\nLima and was withheld from the viceroy. In August Fray Martínez came to\r\nLima to attend a chapter of his Order, which made him comendador of his\r\nruined convent so that he could rebuild it. Villar, who felt much\r\naggrieved, forbade the Provincial, Fray Thomas de Valdez, to issue the\r\ncommission, but the tribunal interposed and by threats of\r\nexcommunication compelled its delivery. Soon after this, at the auto of\r\nNovember 30, 1587, there arose a quarrel, probably about the\r\ndistribution of seats, which resulted in the excommunication of the\r\nviceroy, who was compelled to seek absolution.\r\n\r\nVillar sustained an even more humiliating defeat in another encounter\r\nwhich exhibits the elasticity of inquisitorial jurisdiction. A young man\r\nnamed Antonio de Arpide y Ulloa (possibly of kin to Inquisitor Ulloa)\r\ncame to Lima, with orders to admit him to a “lance” in the lancers of\r\nthe guard, which was accordingly done. Ulloa appointed him fiscal of the\r\ntribunal, although, according to the Visitador Prado, he was naturally\r\nill-conditioned, a youth in all things, careless in his office, and it\r\nwas a scandal to see a fiscal wearing the garments of a layman. Villar\r\nthereupon discharged him from the guard, replacing him with Don Luis de\r\nNevares, for the sufficient reason that the two positions were\r\nincompatible and that no one could enjoy two salaries. Arpide petitioned\r\nthe tribunal for relief; as its official he was entitled to its fuero\r\nand the viceroy had no authority over him. The tribunal confirmed this\r\nview; the viceroy had no right to dismiss him, and it ordered, under a\r\npenalty of a thousand pesos, the officers of the guard to strike from\r\nthe rolls the name of Nevares and replace that of Arpide, to whom the\r\nsalary must be paid. The officers represented that they were under the\r\nviceroy’s orders, when they were told that they had thus incurred\r\nexcommunication and the penalty. The affair was put into the shape of a\r\nsuit between Arpide and Nevares, in which the tribunal of course gave a\r\ndecision in favor of the former and, when the latter appealed the\r\nSuprema, it refused to allow the appeal.\r\n\r\nThere was another source of trouble in the case of Dr. Salinas, a man of\r\nevil reputation, who was appointed advocate of prisoners. Previous to\r\nthis appointment he had uttered disparaging remarks about the viceroy,\r\nand had a quarrel with his secretary Juan Bello. Villar procured the\r\nassent of Ruiz de Prado and arrested Salinas, prosecuted him and\r\nsubjected him to severe torture in the course of the trial. Then the\r\ntribunal interfered and Villar surrendered him and all the papers. This\r\ndid not satisfy Ulloa and Prado, who forgot their mutual strife and\r\nunited to give the viceroy a final blow, as his five years’ term of\r\nservice was drawing to an end. Formal proceedings were commenced against\r\nhim. September 26, 1589, Arpide as fiscal presented his _clamosa_ or\r\nindictment, representing that Villar had always been disaffected to the\r\nInquisition, had talked against it, had impeded it and had diminished\r\nits authority as far as he could. In the case of his secretary, Juan\r\nBello, he had sent a threatening message; at the auto of November 30,\r\n1587, he had invented means to deprive it of the services of its\r\nofficials; as soon as Dr. Salinas received an appointment, he had\r\nprosecuted him for trifling words uttered long before; in the case of\r\nGabriel Martínez de Esquivel, familiar in Huanuco, he had ordered him to\r\nreport forthwith in Spain to the Council of Indies and, when asked by\r\nthe tribunal for his reasons, he had made an offensive reply; he had\r\neven made investigations against the persons and reputations of the\r\ninquisitors themselves. From all this, which was notorious, it followed\r\nthat he had incurred the pains and censures provided by the bull _Si de\r\nprotegendis_ of Pius V (April 1, 1569), against all who offend or\r\ndespise the officials of the Inquisition, wherefore the tribunal was\r\nasked to declare him to have incurred these censures, notwithstanding\r\nany absolution _ad cautelam_ which he might have obtained, so that he\r\nmight serve as an example to all Christian people of their obligation to\r\nrespect and reverence everything connected with the Holy Office.\r\n\r\nWithout going through the prescribed formalities of submitting the\r\nmatter to calificadores and assembling consultores and, without hearing\r\nthe accused, the tribunal that same morning decreed that Villar had\r\nincurred the censures of the bull of Pius V, while for the other\r\npenalties prescribed in it he was remitted to the Suprema. To this the\r\nviceroy replied, October 3d, that he had only sought to perform the\r\nduties of his office, but seeing that they had declared him to be under\r\nthe excommunication of the bull, as an obedient son of the Church he\r\nbegged for absolution and asked that it be speedy, as he was under\r\norders to sail for Spain. For an answer to this he waited until the\r\n16th, when he sent a judge and alcalde de corte, both consultors of the\r\nInquisition, to the tribunal to enquire about his petition. There was\r\nread to them a reply, dated on the 14th, to the effect that the\r\ninquisitors had repeatedly intimated to him that he had incurred these\r\ncensures and, in fact, it was so self-evident that every one could have\r\nknown it, for every one knows that all incur them who impede the\r\nInquisition directly or indirectly, or who ill-treat, in word or deed,\r\nthe inquisitors or officials to the injury of their reputation and\r\nauthority, and that good intentions are powerless to avert it. The\r\nviceroy’s acts had been so notorious that it was needless to recite them\r\nand, before absolution could be granted, condign satisfaction must be\r\nrendered for them, especially to Dr. Diego de Salinas, while, as\r\nregarded the injuries to the Holy Office, he was referred to the\r\nSuprema. As it had long been evident that he was under these censures,\r\nwithout seeking their removal, and as he was about to undertake a long\r\nand perilous voyage, the inquisitors had been moved by loving charity to\r\nbring him to a recognition of the condition of his soul. They were ready\r\nto absolve him as soon as he should do what was requisite and, in\r\nconsideration of his station, he should be spared the solemnities\r\nrequired by law.\r\n\r\nAfter some parleying this portentous document was delivered to Villar on\r\nthe 19th and on the 27th he replied at much length. He had never been\r\ntold that he was under excommunication, or he would at once have applied\r\nfor absolution. He had always favored and enriched the Inquisition; he\r\nhad not proceeded against Dr. Salinas till assured by Prado that he\r\ncould do so, and he had surrendered him and the papers, January 11,\r\n1589, as soon as he was summoned. Then Prado, after consulting Ulloa,\r\nhad given to Fray Pedro de Molina a commission to absolve him _ad\r\ncautelam_, in case he had incurred excommunication for that or anything\r\nelse, and he had received the absolution with great satisfaction, but\r\nthe certificate had been withdrawn more than a month ago, and since then\r\nhe had abstained from hearing mass or taking the sacraments, except on\r\nthe feast of San Francisco (October 4th) when he had special licence\r\nfrom the inquisitors. He did not know how he was to give satisfaction to\r\nDr. Salinas, as the matter had been remitted to the Suprema which, with\r\nthe king, would do as they might see fit. Meanwhile, as a gentleman and\r\nan humble and obedient son of the Church, he again prayed for\r\nabsolution.\r\n\r\nThe victory of the tribunal and the humiliation of the viceroy were\r\ncomplete. When the inquisitors read his petition, October 27th, they\r\nissued to Antonio de Balcázar, provisor of the archdiocese, a commission\r\nto absolve him, at the same time admonishing him to present himself to\r\nthe Suprema as early as possible. They also gave him the papers of the\r\nsuit brought against him by Dr. Salinas, in order to enable him to make\r\nhis defence before the Suprema. Villar received the absolution with much\r\nhumility and satisfaction, as a great favor from the inquisitors, and on\r\nthe 28th the provisor was summoned, who solemnly absolved him in the\r\nchapel of the palace.[661]\r\n\r\nYet Villar was so little reassured that, on his voyage home, he wrote\r\nfrom Havana to implore the protection of the king from the enmity of\r\nSalinas. He rehearsed the services of his ancestors to the monarchy,\r\nwhile of his children five sons had been killed and one crippled in the\r\nking’s wars with heretics and infidels, two more were then serving and\r\ntwo were in training for service, while two had died in the priesthood.\r\nHis fears were probably groundless for the Suprema, in a letter to\r\nPrado, blamed him for the dissensions in the tribunal which it\r\nattributed to his favor for Salinas, a man of such evil life and\r\ntortuous methods that he alone would throw any republic into discord.\r\nApparently it did not as yet know that the secret of the influence of\r\nSalinas was the relations of his sister-in-law with Prado, a scandal\r\nwhich continued until Prado’s recall.[662]\r\n\r\nIt has seemed worth while to give somewhat in detail the particulars of\r\nthis obscure quarrel to illustrate the position adopted by the tribunal\r\ntowards the highest authorities, its arrogant assumption of superiority,\r\nand the readiness with which its jurisdiction could be extended in any\r\ndesired direction. It can easily be perceived how difficult was the task\r\nof the viceroys to maintain an efficient government, and to keep the\r\npeace with so independent and so unruly a factor in the land. But few of\r\nthem escaped collisions, although it does not appear that in any\r\nsubsequent case the quarrel went so far as the institution of a formal\r\nprosecution against the personal representative of the king. It is not\r\nsurprising therefore that, however pious were the viceroys, they were\r\nalmost unanimous in deprecating the acts and the influence of the Holy\r\nOffice. The Count del Villar naturally exhaled his woes in long and\r\nlugubrious epistles to the king. His successor, the Count of Cañete, as\r\nearly in his term as 1589, complained bitterly of the exemptions through\r\nwhich all connected with the Holy Office admitted responsibility to no\r\none. This gave rise to endless trouble, for every one who was summoned\r\nto have his accounts examined, or who refused to pay his dues to the\r\nroyal treasury, procured a familiarship or some office and with it\r\nsecured exemption. Even Alvaro Ruiz de Navamuel, the government\r\nsecretary, had himself made a familiar and auditor, and assumed that he\r\nwas not subject to investigation. The royal officials were familiars-one\r\nof them at Arequipa, when called upon for his accounts, refused because\r\nhe was a familiar.[663] Government conducted after this fashion seems\r\nlike _opéra bouffe_.\r\n\r\nIn like manner the Viceroy Luis de Velasco, in 1604, represented\r\nstrongly to Philip III the intrusion of the tribunal on other\r\njurisdictions and its overbearing methods, so that the superior royal\r\nofficials, on whom rested the peace and quiet of the land, had to\r\nabandon their rights to avoid scandals. As for himself, sometimes he\r\ntemporized, sometimes he yielded, and sometimes he pretended not to see,\r\nin order to avoid dissension, for, when the tribunal was opposed, it\r\nmade public demonstrations, which degraded the authority of the\r\nvice-regal office and of the Royal Audiencia. So, in 1609, the Viceroy\r\nMarquis of Montesclaros, in representing some scandalous ill-treatment\r\nof the alcaldes of the city, declared that the inquisitors were\r\narbitrary and assumed that there was no power superior to them to\r\nrestrain or even to resist them.[664] It was probably representations\r\nsuch as these which led to the concordias of 1610 and 1633. In these\r\nsome of the more flagrant usurpations of authority were forbidden, but\r\nthe underlying principles were unchanged and we have seen how, in\r\nMexico, the attempted reform was frustrated.\r\n\r\nThe Viceroy Count of Alba de Aliste was involved in many encounters with\r\nthe tribunal, for which, as noted above, in 1655, Philip IV sent him a\r\ncopy of the circular letter of 1603 commanding respect and obedience.\r\nThis did not prevent him, in 1657, from writing that the reiteration and\r\nmultiplication of its excesses of jurisdiction might render it necessary\r\nfor him to break with it altogether, as the only way of maintaining the\r\nauthority of the Government.[665] With the advent of the Bourbon\r\ndynasty, the consequent infusion of Gallicanism in Spain, and the\r\nresolute assertion of the regalías, the authority of the viceroys was\r\nmore fully recognized, and we hear less, in the eighteenth century, of\r\ntheir struggles to maintain it against the tribunal. Yet the latter did\r\nnot cease to assert the superiority of its jurisdiction and to extend it\r\nas far as possible, giving rise to a perpetual succession of embittered\r\ncontests with the other judicial organizations, to the detriment of the\r\npublic peace and the weakening of the functions of government. Even\r\nafter its decadence had fairly set in, as late as 1773, the Viceroy\r\nManuel Amat y Yunient writes that the Inquisition, so necessary for the\r\npurity of the faith, would be more useful and respected if it would\r\nconfine itself to its proper functions, for its cognizance of civil\r\ncases has always led to collisions with the royal courts, which are\r\nparticularly prejudicial at this distance from the king and, though\r\nthere have been concordias and royal cédulas to prevent them, there are\r\nnever lacking occasions to revive the contention to the great disquiet\r\nof the people.[666]\r\n\r\nThe eighteenth century, in fact, presents an almost continuous series of\r\nquarrels with all the different jurisdictions, the existence of which so\r\ngreatly weakened the organization of the Spanish colonial system, and\r\nthese quarrels were fought out with a persistent bitterness, sometimes\r\ndegenerating into violence, which taxed to the utmost the efforts of the\r\nviceroys as peacemakers. Into the trivial details of these dreary\r\nconflicts it is not worth while to enter at length, but a single case\r\nmay be briefly described, to illustrate the ferocity displayed by all\r\nparties and the confusion arising from the complexity of the multiplied\r\njudicial systems which influenced Spanish development so unfortunately.\r\n\r\nOn November 11, 1723, two brothers, the Licentiates Juan and Martin\r\nLobaton, presented themselves before the tribunal to claim its\r\nprotection. Juan was cura or parish priest of Soras and commissioner of\r\nthe Inquisition in Guancabelica; Martin was cura of Viñao and “persona\r\nhonesta” or cleric called in to be present when witnesses ratified their\r\nevidence. Both parishes were in the see of Guamanga, then _sede vacante_\r\nand governed by the chapter, which had required Juan to account for the\r\nproperty of an Indian woman, a parishioner who had died some two years\r\nprevious, and it had ordered him not to leave Guamanga, under penalty of\r\nexcommunication, whereupon he had promptly fled to Lima. In his case,\r\nthe fiscal reported that the matter did not concern the Inquisition and\r\nthe papers were returned to the episcopal Ordinary. Martin had assisted\r\nhis brother’s flight and for this he was confined to his house by the\r\nepiscopal authorities and a coadjutor appointed, to the great scandal\r\nand destruction, we are told, of the parish. In this case the tribunal\r\nassumed jurisdiction; it ordered him, June 2, 1724, to be restored and\r\nhis property released, on his giving security, and the chapter was\r\nordered to prosecute before the Inquisition whatever charges it had to\r\nbring against him.\r\n\r\nMartin meanwhile had the town of Guamanga as a prison. On the afternoon\r\nof April 30th, as he was standing in the street, the dean of the\r\nchapter, who was also commissioner of the Inquisition, passed in his\r\ncarriage, then got out and scolded him roundly for not taking off his\r\nhat. Martin withdrew, but the dean, still unsatisfied, went to his house\r\nwith the alcalde, broke open the door and embargoed all his goods--even\r\nto his clothes and breviary--then summoned the chapter and by 5 o’clock\r\nhad him excommunicated and fined twenty pesos, as the papers stated,\r\nfor not removing his hat to the dean an hour before, and notices of the\r\nexcommunication were duly affixed to the doors of the churches.\r\n\r\nWhen the inquisitorial sentence of June 2d was served upon the chapter\r\nit said that it had nothing against Martin, but when his embargoed\r\nproperty came to be restored much of it was found to have been stolen by\r\nthe depositaries to whom it had been confided. The tribunal held the\r\nchapter responsible and ordered the loss to be made good, under threat\r\nof excommunication. The chapter replied, September 29th, that the case\r\nbelonged to the bishop and chapter and its previous surrender of the\r\npapers had been without prejudice. Then Fray Luis de Cabrera, prior of\r\nthe Augustinian convent, to whom the sentence had been sent as executor,\r\nexcommunicated the chapter. The archdeacon as Commissioner of the\r\nCruzada, declared the excommunication void, ordered the notices to be\r\nremoved, and replaced them with others excommunicating Cabrera as a\r\ndisturber of the Bull of the Cruzada. Cabrera responded by\r\nexcommunicating the alguazil and notary of the Cruzada and, on October\r\n2d, the archdeacon pronounced these excommunications to be null.\r\n\r\nWhen the tribunal heard of this, by orders of October 18th and 27th it\r\ndeclared the excommunications on both sides to be null; it put the\r\nmatter of the chapter in the hands of Luis de Mendoza, rector of the\r\nJesuit college, and it ordered Cabrera to push the restitution of\r\nMartin’s property, but not to employ censures without instructions. This\r\nwas the situation when the new bishop, Alfonso Roldan, arrived at Lima\r\nand, on its being stated to him, he expressed himself as satisfied. Then\r\nMartin came before the tribunal asserting that one of the depositaries,\r\nJuan Joseph Lasco, who had stolen most of the goods, had pawned some\r\nsilverware of his with a merchant named Joseph de Villanueva, and asking\r\ntheir restoration on his proving property. Consequently on March 14,\r\n1725, orders were sent to Cabrera that, if the silver were proved to be\r\nMartin’s, it should be deposited in safe hands. This was done on April\r\n5th, when Villanueva deposed that Lasco had pawned with him\r\nninety-three marks of silver plate. He was ordered to deposit it and\r\npromised to do so but, on the 7th, he testified that the day before the\r\nbishop had ordered him not to surrender the silver but to tell Cabrera\r\nto throw up the commission of the Inquisition and any other that he\r\nmight hold. This was followed by the archdeacon notifying Martin to go\r\nto his parish in sixteen hours and, on his representing the\r\nimpossibility of this, as he had been a prisoner for a year and was\r\ndeprived of his property, he was posted as an excommunicate. After\r\nconsiderable delay he was absolved and was told to stay in the city, but\r\non falling sick and unable to assist in the church, he was\r\nexcommunicated again and recluded in his house.\r\n\r\nAll this is a one-sided relation, furnished by the tribunal to the\r\nSuprema. It evidently omits much that would show the tribunal in a less\r\nfavorable light, as the outcome indicates, for in it there is nothing to\r\njustify the intervention of the viceroy and Audiencia. Yet we learn from\r\nanother source that Cabrera had arbitrarily excommunicated and fined the\r\nalcalde of Guamanga who complained to the Audiencia, and on October 30,\r\n1724, the viceroy notified the tribunal that the Audiencia, after\r\nconsidering the evidence, had resolved that the Inquisition should\r\nrestrain its officials. A correspondence ensued, continued until the\r\nsummer of 1725, in which the tribunal complained that the viceroy and\r\nAudiencia were assuming to be the superiors of the Inquisition, in\r\nviolation of the laws and the royal cédulas. The affair finally took the\r\nshape of a competencia referred for settlement to the Suprema and the\r\nCouncil of Indies. The Suprema took high ground; it alone could review\r\nthe acts of the tribunal or entertain appeals, and no other authority\r\nhad power to intervene. This might have answered under Philip IV, but\r\ntimes had changed. A decree of Philip V, February 1, 1729, ordered it to\r\ncorrect the excesses of the tribunal by such means as it deemed\r\nrequisite, and to this it replied, April 16th, that it had revoked the\r\nacts of the tribunal in the affair of Martin Lobaton, ordering the\r\nsurrender of all papers to the Ordinary and judge of Cruzada before\r\nwhom he must plead; that it had entirely disapproved the proceedings of\r\nthe tribunal and that it had instructed the inquisitors hereafter to\r\nobserve the provisions of the law.[667]\r\n\r\nThe Cruzada jurisdiction which emerges in this case was another of the\r\nsubdivisions of judicial authority, which so fatally complicated the\r\nadministration of justice in the Spanish dominions and furnished an\r\nabundant source of quarrels. The indulgence known as the Santa Cruzada\r\nsupplied a large revenue to the crown and the organization for its sale\r\nwas elaborate. At its head was a chief commissioner who held exclusive\r\njurisdiction, civil and criminal, over his subordinates and, although\r\nthis was by law confined to their official acts, yet it was, as we have\r\njust seen, extended to protect them in every way.[668] While the case\r\njust mentioned was in progress, another prolonged quarrel arose,\r\nsimilarly involving all three jurisdictions. Don Antonio de Marcategui,\r\nthe priest of Quiquixana, was also a commissioner of the Inquisition. As\r\nsuch he was already engaged in a contest with the episcopal provisor of\r\nCuzco, in which the Suprema decided against him and ordered all his acts\r\nto be revoked. While this was pending he celebrated mass in the\r\nchapter’s chapel of the Virgin, on a feast-day, without first settling\r\nwith the Cruzada for the indulgences gained there by the worshippers\r\nunder some old concessions. For this Don Juan de Ugarte, commissioner of\r\nthe Cruzada in Cuzco, on January 8, 1724, notified him that he was fined\r\nin three hundred pesos, and also excommunicated him without trial.\r\nMarcategui went to Cuzco and laid the matter before Bishop Arregui, who\r\nsided with Ugarte. After some further trouble the corregidor was sent to\r\narrest him and sequestrate his property; he gathered together some\r\nIndians and Spaniards for resistance but thought better of it and\r\nescaped to Lima when, on appealing to the Inquisition, it declared all\r\nthe proceedings to be invalid and ordered the surrender to it of all\r\nthe papers. The bishop however sent his papers to the viceroy and Ugarte\r\nhis to the Cruzada tribunal of Lima. The inquisitors demanded the former\r\nfrom the viceroy and asked him to compel the Cruzada to surrender the\r\nlatter, but the viceroy refused, alleging that what he held concerned\r\nthe royal _patronato_ and that he had no control over the Cruzada, whose\r\njurisdiction was ecclesiastical, exempt and privileged. To a second\r\ndemand, he expressed the wise determination not to get entangled in\r\necclesiastical matters and jurisdictions, and he further claimed\r\ncognizance of the case of the corregidor, whom the Inquisition was\r\nprosecuting for sequestrating Marcategui’s property and attempting his\r\narrest. He stubbornly rejected repeated requests and he finally ordered\r\nthe tribunal to suspend its summons to Ugarte to appear before it. The\r\ncase was carried to Spain to vex the souls of the Suprema, the Council\r\nof Indies and the Commissioner of the Cruzada. In 1729 the king decided\r\nagainst the Inquisition and ordered the case to be surrendered to the\r\nCruzada and the episcopal court, but it still dragged on and, in 1733, a\r\nroyal decree ordered the Inquisition to obey the Concordias and the\r\nlaws, but even this was not the end, how it was finally settled matters\r\nlittle; its only interest lies in illustrating the hopelessly\r\nimpracticable character of Spanish colonial organization and\r\nadministration.[669]\r\n\r\nThese defeats of the Inquisition were followed soon afterwards by a\r\nstill greater invasion of the privileges of the inquisitorial employees.\r\nA citizen of Lima pursued a slave into the house of a salaried official,\r\nwhereupon the tribunal forthwith ordered his arrest. The royal Audiencia\r\nintervened, representing to the viceroy, the Marquis of Castel-Fuerte,\r\nthat the officials enjoyed only the passive and not the active fuero;\r\nthat the pretensions of the Inquisition, if admitted, would destroy the\r\nroyal jurisdiction, and that an order should be issued requiring the\r\naggrieved party to plead in the Audiencia. This opinion the viceroy\r\nsent to the tribunal with a request that it should abstain. It replied\r\nthat the official had withdrawn his complaint on account of the\r\napologies made to him, but that the tribunal could not assent to the\r\nposition of the Audiencia without committing the grave fault of\r\ncrippling its powers. A considerable correspondence ensued in which the\r\nAudiencia asserted decisively that, in matters not connected with faith,\r\nthe officials of the Inquisition did not enjoy the fuero and much less\r\nthe active fuero; that there were no laws or customs to contravene the\r\nsettled principle that the plaintiff or prosecutor must seek the court\r\nof the defendant. To this the tribunal replied that the Audiencia had no\r\nauthority to frame general rules in contravention of laws and customs,\r\nand that the matter must be settled by the Suprema. Castel-Fuerte\r\nrejoined that the competence of the royal court was not to be impugned,\r\nthat the Suprema had cognizance only of matters of faith and that to\r\nadmit the contrary was to place the whole administration of justice at\r\nthe mercy of the tribunal.[670]\r\n\r\nThese were brave words which a century earlier would have consigned the\r\nutterer to disgrace. They were the denial of the privileges and\r\nexemptions which the Inquisition had enjoyed for nearly two centuries\r\nand a half, and their significance lies in their expression of the\r\ntendencies of the period. In time those tendencies brought about their\r\ninevitable development. In 1744 there was a contest over the will of D.\r\nFelix Antonio de Vargas, in the consulado or commercial court. A\r\nsecretary of the tribunal claimed to have an interest in the estate, and\r\nit consequently asserted jurisdiction over the whole affair. This was\r\nresisted by the consulado, and Viceroy Villagarcia ordered a _sala de\r\ncompetencia_ to decide between the conflicting claims, according to\r\nestablished rule. The tribunal refused, on the ground that its rights\r\nwere too clear to be called in question. While this was pending,\r\nSuperunda succeeded to Villagarcia and, after no little trouble, he\r\ninduced the visitador Arenaza to agree to a _sala reflexa_, to\r\ndetermine whether a _sala de competencia_ should be held. Then there\r\ncame fresh trouble on the side of the senior judge of the Consulado, but\r\nfinally the decision was reached that the officials of the Inquisition\r\nwere entitled to the active fuero. When Superunda reported the matter to\r\nFernando VI there resulted the royal cédula of June 20, 1751, declaring\r\nthat the officials should enjoy only the passive fuero, and this in both\r\ncivil cases and those criminal ones not excepted by the concordias,\r\nwhile their servants and the familiars were wholly deprived of it. In\r\nthe case in question, the papers were to be surrendered to the\r\nConsulado; in future no sala reflexa was to be held and, when the matter\r\nwas so clear as in this one, the viceroy should decide it, as the effort\r\nwas manifestly an assault on the regalías.\r\n\r\nBy this time Arenaza had departed and the inquisitors were Amusquíbar\r\nand Rodríguez. The latter was disposed to accept the royal cédula\r\nwithout dispute, but Amusquíbar refused to obey it on the ground that it\r\nhad not come with the confirmation of the Suprema. A long wrangle\r\nensued, but at length another cédula of February 29, 1760, was received,\r\nordering the observance of the previous one, and this time it was\r\naccompanied by a corresponding decree of the Suprema. These were\r\ncommunicated to the tribunal, March 24, 1761, which, seeing that further\r\nresistance was useless, promptly promised obedience. This was followed\r\nby a demand for the papers of the estate of Vargas, which, after an\r\ninterval of seventeen years, was at length placed in train for\r\nadjudication.[671]\r\n\r\nThis settled the question as to the civil jurisdiction of the tribunal\r\nand simultaneously another case put an end to conflicts over criminal\r\nmatters. A negro slave of the alguazil mayor had been arrested for some\r\noffence; the tribunal demanded the prisoner with its customary threats\r\nof fines and excommunications. The affair was pending when the cédula of\r\n1760 was received; the Audiencia thereupon served on the tribunal an\r\ninhibition to issue letters of excommunication and fine against the\r\nalcaldes del crimen and proceeded to try the slave. The cédula was sent\r\nto all the judicial officers of the vice-royalty and they were ordered\r\nto defend the royal jurisdiction in all cases covered by it. To the\r\narrogant temper of Amusquíbar this limitation of the traditional\r\njurisdiction of the Inquisition must have been gall and wormwood, but it\r\nwas worth much to the peace of the land. In 1796, the Viceroy, Frey\r\nFrancisco Gil de Taboado y Lemos, tells us that it had put an end to the\r\nformer conflicts between the jurisdictions.[672]\r\n\r\nWe have seen how neglectful was Amusquíbar of the real duties of his\r\noffice, but he found time and energy to keep Barroeta y Angel, the\r\nArchbishop of Lima, in a condition of exasperation for years, and in\r\nthis he seems to have had the support not only of the Suprema but of\r\nFernando VI. What was the origin of the dissension between them does not\r\nappear, but Barroeta lost no opportunity of exercising his authority for\r\nAmusquíbar’s annoyance and always to his own discomfiture. The rupture\r\nmust already have been pronounced when, October 4, 1752, Barroeta wrote\r\ncalling his attention to the fact that his licence as confessor had not\r\nbeen renewed, while in spite of this he continued his visits to the\r\nnunneries of the Recollects, which was unfitting his position and was\r\nprohibited; his ceasing these visits would relieve the Archbishop from\r\nfurther proceedings. This sharp provocation was disarmed by cool\r\ninsolence. Amusquíbar delayed a reply until November 14th, when he\r\nsimply said that he had postponed acknowledging the note in order to be\r\ntemperate, and he now omitted answering it in order not to fail in the\r\nrespect due to his own office and the dignity of the archbishop.\r\nBarroeta transmitted the correspondence to the Suprema for redress and\r\nobtained none. Amusquíbar, however, ceased his visits but kept up a\r\ncorrespondence. So it was, in 1756, when Barroeta called upon Amusquíbar\r\nand Rodríguez for a statement of settlements with creditors and sales of\r\nfarms belonging to chaplaincies, in order that he might see that the\r\nsouls of the founders were reaping the benefits designed in the\r\nfoundations. The inquisitors replied that it was impossible and, on his\r\nasking why, replied that it was on account of the mode of his demand;\r\nthe archbishop could send his fiscal and any special question about any\r\nspecial foundation would be answered. Again he forwarded the letters to\r\nthe Suprema but its only action was to file them away. He had equal\r\nill-luck in all the questions that he raised. In 1751 the Suprema sent\r\nto Amusquíbar its approval and that of the king, as to his conduct in an\r\nencounter with Barroeta over jubilee faculties for absolving for heresy.\r\nThen Barroeta claimed that the inquisitors should submit to him their\r\nlicences to celebrate and hear confessions, but the king decided against\r\nhim. Barroeta transferred the delegation of his inquisitorial\r\njurisdiction from his Ordinary to another person; the tribunal disputed\r\nit and the king decided in its favor. He undertook to deprive the\r\ninquisitors of their faculties as confessors, and only provoked fresh\r\nrebukes from Spain. He issued an edict on fasting which the tribunal\r\nprohibited; then he printed it at the end of his Synodal Constitutions\r\nonly to have the prohibition confirmed and the decision approved by the\r\nSuprema. There was a question about the notary of the episcopal court\r\ngoing to the tribunal to report certain acts, in which the Suprema\r\nsustained its action, and the visits of ceremony between them was a\r\nfruitful source of controversy.[673] Barroeta died, December 10, 1757,\r\nhis whole episcopate marred with these little squabbles. It is all very\r\npetty, but it illustrates how the relations of the Inquisition with the\r\nspiritual authorities were as unfriendly as with the temporal.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThus far we have considered the activity of the tribunal in matters\r\nforeign to its original purpose, which, indeed, were the most important\r\nportion of its record. As regards its proper function, that of\r\nmaintaining the purity of the faith, its chief business in Peru, as in\r\nSpain, was with a class of cases which could only by forced construction\r\nbe considered as heretical. Bigamists furnished a large proportion of\r\npenitents--the adventurer who left a wife in Andalusian Córdoba was apt\r\nto take a new one in Córdova de Tucuman and chance might at any time\r\nbring detection, while, even in Peru itself, distances were so great and\r\nintercommunication so difficult, that the seeker after fortune was\r\neasily tempted in his wanderings to duplicate the sacrament of\r\nmatrimony. Blasphemy was another prolific source of prosecution, for the\r\ngambling habit was universal and lost none of its provocative character\r\nin crossing the ocean. Sorcery moreover, including the innumerable\r\nsuperstitions for creating love or hatred, curing or causing disease,\r\nbringing fortune or averting misfortune, and foretelling the future,\r\nwhich were technically held to include implicit or explicit pact with\r\nthe demon, brought an ample store of culprits before the tribunal. To\r\nthe mass of superstitious beliefs carried from home by the Spaniards\r\nwere speedily superadded those of the native wise-women and a sprinkling\r\ntaught by Guinea negro slaves. We find but few whites among these\r\noffenders, but every other caste is represented--negro, mulatto,\r\nquadroon, mestizo and sambo and sometimes Indian, for in this crime the\r\njurisdiction of the Inquisition over the Indians seems to have been\r\nadmitted. One feature of Indian sorcery which constantly meets us is the\r\nuse of the drug coca, owing to the marvellous properties attributed to\r\nit, akin to the _peyote_ which, in Mexico, was employed to produce\r\nfatidical dreams and revelations. Both of these were strictly prohibited\r\nby the respective Inquisitions.[674]\r\n\r\nNo specific cases of witchcraft occur in the autos de fe, but, in 1629,\r\na special Edict of Faith directed against the occult arts and sorcery\r\nwas published, enumerating all the forbidden practices in minute detail\r\nand forming a curious body of superstitions and folk-lore, much more\r\nextensive than anything of the kind issued in Spain. It brought in, we\r\nare told, numerous denunciations, but the practices were ineradicable\r\nand continued to flourish until the end. The virtual paralysis of the\r\ntribunal in the later years of Amusquíbar caused many complaints, among\r\nwhich was one from Córdova de Tucuman to the Suprema, representing that,\r\nin the interior provinces, sorcery was universal; there was no case of\r\nsickness that was not attributed to it, but denunciations and testimony\r\nsent to the tribunal received no attention and, as the civil magistrates\r\nwere precluded from acting, it flourished unrepressed.[675]\r\n\r\nPropositions, which furnished so large a portion of the work of the\r\nSpanish tribunals, afforded a much smaller percentage in Peru. This is\r\nprobably attributable to lack of intellectual activity, for some of the\r\ncases tried indicate that the susceptibility of the Inquisition was as\r\ndelicate as in Spain, and that there was the same readiness to denounce\r\nany careless speech or ill-sounding remark uttered in vexation or anger.\r\nThus, in 1592, Felipe de Lujan was tried because, when looking at a\r\npicture of the Last Judgement, he said it was not well painted, for\r\nChrist was not with the Apostles. Juan de Arianza had the indelible\r\ndisgrace of appearing in the auto of February 27, 1631, because, when\r\nreading the Scriptures, he exclaimed “Ea! there is nothing but living\r\nand dying,” which sounded ill to those who heard it. A case, which came\r\nnear to ending in tragedy, was that of Antonio de Campos who, for\r\nuttering certain heretical propositions and adhering to them\r\npertinaciously, was condemned to relaxation. Fortunately for him the\r\nexpense of a public auto was too great to be incurred for him and the\r\nSuprema was consulted, in 1672. During the delay thus caused it was\r\nfound that his real name was Fray Teodoro de Ribera and that his brain\r\nhad been turned by a potion given to him by a woman. This afforded a\r\nsolution and he was handed over as insane to his Provincial. A case in\r\n1721 is noteworthy as illustrating the dangers which environed all\r\nspeculations connected with the Church. A Frenchman, known as Juan de\r\nUllos, was denounced for saying that neither the pope nor a general\r\ncouncil was the head of the Church. In due course this proposition was\r\nsubmitted to two calificadores, Padre Luis de Andrade, S. J., and the\r\nMercenarian Fray Francisco Galiano. It was probably through some vague\r\nreference to Gallicanism that they reported that the qualification was\r\ndifficult because the accused was a Frenchman, and for this they were\r\nimprisoned, with sequestration of their property.[676]\r\n\r\nAs we have already seen in Mexico (p. 241), one of the most frequent\r\noffences, not strictly heretical, with which the Inquisition had to\r\ndeal, was that of so-called solicitation--the seduction of women by\r\npriests in the confessional, but as these offenders never appear in the\r\nrelations of the autos, they are only to be gathered from more or less\r\nimperfect records. Prior to 1578 there had been various cases, about one\r\nof which, that of Antonio Hernández de Villaroel, the tribunal reported\r\nthat it could not diminish the penalty of perpetual deprivation of\r\nconfessing women, because this had been ordered by the Suprema in the\r\ncase of Rodrigo de Arcos, and this was construed as a general law. If\r\nso, it was not long in force for, about 1580, we find Juan de Alarcon\r\ndeprived for only three years. In a collection of cases between 1578 and\r\n1581 there are seven of solicitation and between 1581 and 1585 there are\r\neight. Thus they are constantly appearing and, in 1595, we are told that\r\nthere were twenty-four priests in prison awaiting sentence, one of whom,\r\nJuan de Figueroa, was testified against by forty-three women. In 1597\r\nseven priests were prosecuted from the province of Tucuman alone, where,\r\namong the Indian converts, few confessors seem to have had\r\nscruples.[677]\r\n\r\nIn view of the heinousness of the offence the treatment of culprits in\r\nSpain was remarkably lenient, but this was surpassed by the tenderness\r\nshown to them in Peru. Another fraile from Tucuman, the Dominican\r\nFrancisco Vázquez, was sentenced, in 1599, for this and for twenty-four\r\nscandalous propositions, but for this cumulation of offences he escaped\r\nwith deprivation of confessing women and reclusion for a year in a\r\nconvent. At the same time the Franciscan Bartolomé de la Cruz, Guardian\r\nof the convent at Santiago de Estero, against whom fifteen women\r\ntestified, was deprived of confessing and had some spiritual penances.\r\nFray Andrés Corral, Guardian of the convent at las Juntas, testified\r\nagainst by twenty-eight women, had aggravated the offence by committing\r\nrape in the church and for this he was banished from Tucuman and\r\nsubjected to a discipline. On the other hand Rodrigo Ortiz Melgarejo,\r\nthe only priest in Asuncion, denounced himself to the commissioner in\r\n1594, to the delegate in Asuncion and to the tribunal in 1596, for guilt\r\nwith seven women. He was obliged to go to Lima, where he presented\r\nhimself in 1600. He was regarded as excessively scrupulous, he had\r\nperformed a journey of over a thousand miles and this seems to have been\r\nthought an ample punishment. The fact that there was no evidence against\r\nhim shows that the commissioner and his delegate regarded the matter as\r\ntoo trivial to gather testimony about it.[678]\r\n\r\nIn some of these cases the customary reading of the sentences before\r\ncolleagues of the culprits was omitted because, as the tribunal\r\nexplained, there were so many of them of various Orders that the\r\nomission seemed best to spare the honor of the religious bodies; the\r\ncharacter of the Indian female witnesses was doubtful, but experience\r\nshowed that they spoke truth, for most of the accused confessed and this\r\nwas confirmed by the evil lives and example of all the frailes summoned\r\nfrom Tucuman. This had led the tribunal to deprive them perpetually of\r\nconfessing women, even when the witnesses were Indians and few in\r\nnumber, especially as all those priests and frailes were very ignorant\r\nand profligate.[679]\r\n\r\nInquisitor Ordóñez, as we have seen, was not especially sensitive or\r\nstraight-laced, but he felt compelled, in a letter of April 20, 1599, to\r\ncall the attention of the Suprema to the frequency of solicitation,\r\nespecially in Tucuman, where, as he said, it appeared that there was\r\nscarce a priest not guilty of it, and the worst feature was that some of\r\nthem told the Indian women that the sin was no sin when committed with\r\nthem, and it was consummated in the churches. He therefore asked\r\nauthority to increase the punishment indicated in the Instructions and\r\nthe Suprema accordingly gave permission to add service in the galleys--a\r\npermission, however, of which the tribunal seems never to have availed\r\nitself. So far from there being an improvement, the tribunal was led to\r\nissue, in 1630, a special edict to the effect that, notwithstanding the\r\nclauses in the annual Edict of Faith, the crime continued to prevail;\r\nthat confessors ignored that it was strictly reserved to the\r\nInquisition, and absolved the guilty as well as the penitents, without\r\nrequiring the latter to denounce their seducers as prescribed by the\r\npapal decrees; further, that learned persons when consulted furnished\r\nopinions that these cases did not come within inquisitorial\r\njurisdiction; wherefore all persons were required, within six days after\r\nnotice, to denounce these offenders under pain of excommunication _latæ\r\nsententiæ_.[680]\r\n\r\nIt was all in vain and solicitation continued until the end to furnish a\r\nnotable portion of the dwindling business of the tribunal. As late as\r\n1806 the fiscal Sobrino reported to the Suprema that the worst criminals\r\nwere to be found in the vice-royalty of Buenos Ayres, which was\r\nhastening to its ruin, especially through irreligious propositions and\r\nsolicitation. Possibly wholesome severity might have placed some check\r\non the persistency of the crime, but the same inexplicable tenderness\r\ncontinued to be shown to culprits. In 1737, Pedro de Zubieta, canon of\r\nLima, denounced himself for soliciting Doña Lorenza de Fuentes, a nun in\r\nthe convent of la Concepcion--a confession which she confirmed to some\r\nextent. Then Sor Eugenia Evangelista, of the convent del Prado,\r\ndenounced him with details of the filthiest and most corrupting talk.\r\nAs, however, he was a person of consideration, the tribunal, before\r\ntaking action, consulted the Suprema, with the result that, in 1743, he\r\nwas merely reprimanded and advised to give up hearing confessions.\r\nAlmost equal leniency was shown, in 1793, to the priest Fermin de\r\nAguirre, whose sentence was read in the presence of twelve priests, when\r\nhe abjured _de levi_ and had some spiritual penances.[681]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMore nearly akin to the real business of the Inquisition was its dealing\r\nwith the class known as _beatas revelanderas_--women professing a holy\r\nlife, specially favored by heaven with trances, revelations and visions,\r\nand gifted with spiritual attributes and powers. Popular superstition\r\nrendered this a profitable trade in Spain, where the Holy Office was\r\nperpetually engaged in exposing and punishing their impostures; Peru was\r\nequally afflicted; indeed, the boldness and grossness of their demands\r\nupon the credulity of the people exceeded even that displayed in the\r\nmother country.\r\n\r\nAlmost the first occupation of the new tribunal was a case of this kind.\r\nAbout 1568, in Lima, a young _endemoniada_, named María Pizarro, had\r\nvisitations from the angel Gabriel, in which many things were revealed\r\nto her, including the Immaculate Conception. She was exorcised by\r\nnumerous frailes, who accepted these revelations and carried them out to\r\ntheir ultimate conclusions. Conspicuous among these were the Padres Luis\r\nLópez and Gerónimo Ruiz Portillo, two of the three Jesuits selected by\r\nS. Francisco de Borja as the first missionaries of the Society sent to\r\nPeru, where they were received as angels of light. There were also\r\nseveral Dominicans--Fray Francisco de la Cruz, professor of theology and\r\na man of such high repute that the Archbishop of Lima had proposed him\r\nas coadjutor--Fray Pedro de Toro, Fray Alonso Gasco, prior of the\r\nconvent of Quito, and others of minor importance. Early in 1571 Gasco\r\ndenounced himself to the Bishop of Quito and surrendered sundry objects\r\nwhich had been blessed by the demon, among them a copy-book of blank\r\npaper, two pens and a cloth. The paper had the faculty that whatever was\r\nwritten on it was true, even in doubtful matters, and the cloth was a\r\ncure for disease. The bishop sent Gasco to the tribunal, where he was\r\nimprisoned, May 8, 1572; the others and María Pizarro were arrested at\r\ndifferent times.\r\n\r\nNone of them seem to have denied their belief in the revelations. María\r\nfell sick, after making a full confession, in which she accused herself\r\nof having served as a succubus to the demon, and Padre Luis López of\r\nhaving corrupted her, of which she gave full details. She was several\r\ntimes thought to be dying, when her confessions were read over to her,\r\nwhich she altered several times, finally disculpating López and\r\nasserting herself to be a virgin--all of which was disproved. She died,\r\nDecember 11, 1573, and was secretly interred in the convent of la\r\nMerced.\r\n\r\nThe most conspicuous figure in the affair was Francisco de la Cruz; he\r\nstoutly maintained his belief that the revelations came from the angel,\r\nand he persistently asserted the doctrines deduced from them. The\r\ncalificadores pronounced them to be heretical in the highest degree and\r\nhim to be a heretic more dangerous than Luther, for under his teachings\r\npriests would be permitted to marry, laymen to practise polygamy,\r\nconfession would be abolished and excommunication be disregarded, duels\r\nbe allowed and soldiers permitted to enslave the Indians. Such a man\r\nteaching such principles could cause a revolution and overthrow the\r\nSpanish sovereignty. Moreover, by Doña Leonor de Valenzuela, a married\r\nwoman, he had a child named Gravelico who was to be another Job and John\r\nthe Baptist; he was now beginning to talk and to say that God was his\r\nfather and the Virgin his mother. He was too dangerous an imp to be at\r\nlarge; the tribunal prudently seized him, secretly shipped him to Panamá\r\nand had him forwarded to Trujillo and placed with Don Juan de Sandoval.\r\nThe fraile himself on trial was stubbornly pertinacious; his advocate\r\nand a _patron theológico_ abandoned his defence, whereat he expressed\r\nhis satisfaction; his sanity was called in question, but he defended\r\nhis opinions with such dexterity that this excuse was abandoned; four\r\ntheologians were let loose upon him to strive for his conversion, but\r\nhis convictions were unalterable. There was no alternative but to\r\ncondemn him to relaxation as a pertinacious and impenitent heretic,\r\nwhich was duly agreed to, July 14, 1576, after his trial had lasted for\r\nnearly five years. Then, on May 18, 1577, he was tortured without\r\nsuccess to discover his intention in his heresies, and he waited for\r\nnearly a year more until the final act of the tragedy in the auto of\r\nApril 1, 1578. As he was said to have repented at the last, he was\r\nprobably strangled before burning.\r\n\r\nThe trial of Fray Pedro de Toro was approaching its conclusion, after\r\nmore than three years of incarceration, when, in September, 1575, he was\r\nreported to be dangerously ill. A sentence of reconciliation was adopted\r\nand he was allowed to be sacramentally absolved. Early in January, 1576,\r\nhe was nearing his end and on the 13th he was transferred to the house\r\nof a familiar, where he died on the 16th. He was secretly buried in the\r\nchurch of San Domingo and was reconciled in effigy in the auto of 1578.\r\n\r\nFray Alonso Gasco, although self-denounced, was moderately tortured on\r\nintention. He was sentenced to appear in the auto, to abjure _de\r\nvehementi_, to six years’ reclusion in a monastery, he was deprived of\r\ncelebrating for one year and perpetually of active and passive voice,\r\nteaching, preaching and confessing, and was to be sent to Spain to\r\nperform his penance. After the auto he was duly shipped by the fleet,\r\nApril 20th, but on the voyage he talked about his case, which was\r\nforbidden by the Inquisition, and the tribunal asked the Suprema to\r\nprosecute him again. His place of reclusion was the convent of Jerez de\r\nla Frontera.\r\n\r\nThe Mercenarian, Fray Gaspar de la Huerta, was the _profeta oculto_ of\r\nthe revelations, and was mixed up in the affair; besides, he had\r\nadministered sacraments without being in full orders and had managed\r\ncommunications in prison between the accomplices. He appeared in the\r\nauto, was degraded from his orders, received two hundred lashes and was\r\nsent to the galleys for life.\r\n\r\nThen there was a poor man named Diego Vaca, who could neither read nor\r\nwrite, but who had some dreams which Cruz and Toro regarded as\r\nrevelations. He was put on trial, but acknowledged his errors and the\r\ncase was dropped. The Dominican Provincial, Fray Andres Velez, was\r\nbrought into the affair because the prisoners had written to him and he\r\nhad replied that efforts were making in Spain, with influence and money,\r\nto obtain relief from the tyranny of the inquisitors. Proceedings were\r\ncommenced against him but he got wind of them and escaped to Spain early\r\nin 1575. The tribunal asked the Suprema to have him returned but he\r\nsucceeded in averting this.\r\n\r\nIn all this affair some mysterious influence protected the Jesuits, who\r\nescaped prosecution with their accomplices. After the auto, however,\r\nPadre López was imprudent enough to say that Cruz had been insane, in\r\nspite of which the inquisitors had made a heretic of him and that he\r\nwould not wish to have Cerezuela’s conscience. The tribunal thereupon\r\nreferred to its records which proved him to have been the principal\r\nexorciser of María Pizarro and to have corrupted her. It further\r\ngathered testimony showing him to be an habitual solicitor in confession\r\nand among his papers was found a tract impugning the rightful possession\r\nof Peru by Philip II--a document so treasonable that the viceroy sent a\r\ncopy of it to the king, for such action as he might deem fit, seeing\r\nthat López was one of the most prominent and influential of the Jesuits.\r\nOn his trial, López admitted the evidence as to solicitation and\r\nconfessed to other cases, although he argued that they were not\r\ntechnically _in actu confessionis_. He was spared appearance in an auto.\r\nHis sentence was privately read in presence of eight Jesuit confessors\r\nand then again in the Jesuit college in presence of all the Jesuits,\r\nwhere a discipline was administered lasting the space of two\r\n_Misereres_. It bore that he was to be sent to Spain by the first fleet,\r\nbeing strictly, during the interval, confined in the college,\r\n_incomunicado_. In Spain he was to be recluded for two years in the\r\nJesuit house of Triguera, after which for four years he was to be\r\nconfined in some designated place and ten leagues around it; he was\r\ndeprived perpetually of confessing women and for two years of confessing\r\nmen. He was duly forwarded in the next fleet.[682]\r\n\r\nDoña Luisa Melgarejo was a bolder practitioner than María Pizarro. She\r\nhad been the mistress of Dr. Juan de Soto, who had been compelled to\r\nmarry her. For twelve years she carried on a profitable trade in\r\necstasies, revelations and other manifestations, and was largely\r\nconsulted about marriages, undertaking voyages, obtaining positions and\r\nother similar matters, which brought in corresponding fees. Unbelievers\r\ncompared her to the image of a saint and Dr. Soto to the basin under it\r\nfor receiving offerings. When she was arrested, November 14, 1623, her\r\nwritings, consisting of fifty-seven _cuadernos_, were seized in the\r\nhands of two Jesuits, Padres Contreras and Torres, and were found to be\r\nfull of alterations and erasures by them to eliminate numerous heresies.\r\nApparently the collusion of Jesuits indicated caution, and Inquisitor\r\nGaitan, May 1, 1624, reported the matter to the Suprema and asked for\r\ninstructions, with what result the records fail to inform us.[683] She\r\ndid not appear in the auto of December 21, 1625, in which there figured\r\nfour similar _embusteras_, who had traded on ecstasies and revelations.\r\nThree of these, María de Santo Domingo of Trujillo, Isabel de Ormaza and\r\nIsabel de Jesus of Lima, had given proof of exuberant imaginations in\r\nspeculating upon the inexhaustible appetite for marvels.[684]\r\n\r\nIn the auto of March 16, 1693, there appeared Angela de Olivitos y\r\nEsquivel as an _embustera hipocrita_. She was a sempstress by trade and\r\nhad not lived a moral life, as she had borne a child to one of her\r\ndevotees. She was sentenced to reclusion for five years in a designated\r\nplace and not to talk or write about revelations.[685] She was probably\r\nan humble imitator of the queen of impostors, Angela Carranza. This\r\nremarkable woman was born in Tucuman about 1638. In 1665 she came to\r\nLima and commenced to have trances which she took care to be in public\r\nand mostly in the churches. In 1673 she began to write out her\r\nrevelations, and learned men became her amanuenses till the product\r\namounted to fifteen volumes of a thousand pages each, in a small and\r\nclose handwriting. Her only qualifications were an exhaustless\r\nimagination and amazing audacity. In her youth her unchastity had been\r\nnotorious and she confessed it in her trial; she was self-indulgent in\r\neating and sleeping, foul and indecent in her talk and had no shame in\r\nexposing her person. Such was the impostor who for fifteen years, by\r\nmere dint of self-assertion, made herself feared and revered not only in\r\nLima but throughout Peru. As Inquisitor Valera says, in his report of\r\nthe case, “She, who was the common sewer of errors, was regarded as a\r\nparadise of perfections. In the mistaken apprehensions of men she was\r\nthe saint of the age, the wonder of the world, the mistress of\r\nmysticism, the advocate of the people; so frequent were the accepted\r\nmiracles, ecstasies, trances, intelligences and revelations that heaven\r\nwas regarded as condensed in her.... Rosaries and beads were taken to\r\nher house not one by one but in whole chests and they passed to Spain\r\nand even to Rome with her renown.... In the common belief of the\r\nkingdom, naught was lacking to her but canonization and the altar.\r\nFragments of what she had touched were cherished with the belief that\r\nthey would soon become relics.... She deceived the human race in this\r\nkingdom--viceroys, archbishops, bishops and prelates.” She threatened\r\nand prophesied death to those who displeased her, and few there were who\r\ncould resist the superstitious terror that came over them when she\r\nuttered her evil forecasts. Those who did not believe in her she\r\nmaligned, and we are told that it greatly injured their prospects on\r\naccount of her repute, not only among the vulgar but among the learned\r\nand wise, who regarded her words as oracles from heaven. The profound\r\nfaith which she inspired is illustrated by the incident that when, after\r\nthe earthquake of 1687, there was an inundation, and at night the report\r\nwas spread that the sea was engulfing the land, there was a panic in\r\nwhich all who could fled to the mountains. A man in charge of the chest\r\nin which her writings were kept said to his assistant that there was no\r\ndanger of the sea rising to the writings of the angel, even if it\r\ncovered the whole earth, so the two mounted the chest and stood there\r\nuntil the terror passed.[686]\r\n\r\nIt argues a surprisingly low level of intelligence that men of the\r\nhighest station in State and Church, of presumable culture in the\r\nlearned professions, and of common-sense in the business walks of life,\r\nshould have accepted without question the vulgar absurdities, poured\r\nforth in a constant stream, which reduced the awful mysteries of the\r\nspiritual world to the basest condition of common life, and represented\r\nthe vituperative, coarse, grasping, self-indulgent woman, whom they saw\r\nleading an animal existence, as the one human being selected by God to\r\nbe the repository of his powers over heaven, purgatory and hell, so that\r\nthe Holy Ghost had told her that she was the daughter of the Father, the\r\nmother of the Son, the spouse of the Holy Ghost and the _sagrario_ of\r\nthe Trinity, and once, in presence of the Trinity, the Son made her take\r\nhis seat for he wished her to form the Trinity with the Father and Holy\r\nGhost. She threatened that she would wake up the pope and cardinals and\r\nknock them on the head to make them define the mystery of the Immaculate\r\nConception. Once on entering the church of the Incarnation she met the\r\nVirgin, who offered her the breast; on sucking she complained that the\r\nmilk was salt, and the Virgin replied that it had become so in waiting\r\nfor her. Christ, with the Virgin, angels and saints, once entered her\r\nchamber; he asked for a chair and wanted to know whether he had to sit\r\non the bench with the rest, after which the bench was greatly prized by\r\nher devotees as a relic. It would be endless to repeat all these\r\nabsurdities which met with such devout credence and a single one of her\r\nstories will suffice. In a field of straw she saw Christ walking hand in\r\nhand with a young girl dressed as a beata. Filled with jealousy she set\r\nfire to the straw and left Christ burning, and when the angels\r\nremonstrated she said she was going to purgatory to release souls and\r\nthen to hell to do the same. She went to purgatory and released many\r\nsouls, but some would not go, among them her father, who said that his\r\ntime would not come until she was dead, when she replied that he would\r\nhave to wait, for she was still a young girl.[687]\r\n\r\nShe did a thriving business in many ways. She carried to heaven beads,\r\nrosaries, candles, bells, swords and rosemary, which were blessed on\r\nvarious saints’ days and possessed special virtues accordingly. They\r\nwere brought to her for the purpose by the basketful and, on one\r\noccasion, Christ was vexed and said “This is a huckster business.” When\r\nshe was condemned and they were brought in they filled a room in the\r\nInquisition. Once she lent her shoes to the Virgin, whereupon Christ\r\ngave to her shoes the same virtue as that of the rosaries, which made a\r\ngreat demand for her old shoes. This kept her in foot-gear, for new\r\nshoes were constantly brought to exchange for her old ones. Her\r\nintervention was continually invoked in cases of sickness and\r\ndifficulty, and her prophetic power was sought in marriages, voyages and\r\nenterprises of all kinds. These she sold at a round price and she had a\r\ncashier who kept an itemized account of her receipts--so much for a case\r\nof mumps, so much for fever, so much for the miracle of the ingots--and\r\nsome of the entries were of one and two thousand pesos.[688]\r\n\r\nAfter fifteen years of success, there would seem no reason why this\r\ncareer might not have continued until her death, to be followed with a\r\ndemand for her canonization supported by ample store of miracles.\r\nPossibly there may be truth in the story that, on a rainy day in the\r\ncalle del Rastro, she disputed the sidewalk with a Franciscan fraile,\r\nwho rudely elbowed her into the mud. This caused such indignation that\r\nthe offender expiated his clownishness with two months in the convent\r\nprison, when, to satisfy his rancor, he kept close watch on her and\r\nobtained proof that she was a sinner, whereupon he denounced her to the\r\nInquisition.[689] If so, the denunciation came to one ready to act upon\r\nit in spite of the shock given to public opinion. Inquisitor Valera,\r\nwhose resolute aggressiveness had rendered his career in Cartagena one\r\nof perpetual turbulence, had just been transferred to Lima, and\r\ndoubtless eagerly seized the occasion to make an impression in his new\r\npost. Angela de Dios, as she called herself, was arrested December 21,\r\n1688. The trial lasted for six years, owing doubtless to the immense\r\nmass of her writings to be examined, and her numerous heresies to be\r\ncharacterized and condemned, for she had ventured upon dangerous\r\ntheological ground and had constructed a grotesque theogony to prove the\r\nImmaculate Conception. In her prolonged incarceration she professed to\r\nbe still comforted by visits from Christ and the Virgin; she bore her\r\nconfinement cheerfully, was eager for her three meals a day, and was\r\ngenerally found snoring when her cell was entered.[690]\r\n\r\nHer system of defence was shrewd. She denied having given assent or\r\nbelief to what was expressed in her writings; she had merely recited\r\nwhat she had seen and heard in her trances and submitted it to the\r\nlearned men who were her confessors. Finally on June 2, 1694, she asked\r\nfor an audience in which she said that, enlightened by God through this\r\nholy tribunal, she had been illuminated to detest the doctrines and\r\npropositions in her writings, which she now saw were heretical and\r\nblasphemous and defamatory. There had been, she said, no deception on\r\nher part as to her visions, and she had referred them to those whose\r\nvirtue and religion enabled them to counsel her. Under their command she\r\nhad reduced them to writing; she had wanted to burn the writings, but\r\nhad been forbidden to do so and had never seen them after they left her\r\nhands. Now that the tribunal had condemned them she asked pardon of God\r\nand of his judges and ministers, for she saw that she had been deceived.\r\nNothing more could be required and her sentence soon followed, which\r\nbore that she was to appear in a public auto, to abjure _de vehementi_,\r\nto be confined in a monastery for four years, to be deprived of pen and\r\nink, and never to treat of revelations, together with sundry spiritual\r\nexercises and ten years’ exile from Lima and Tucuman, while a public\r\nedict ordered the surrender of all beads, rosaries, nail-parings and\r\nother objects treasured as relics.[691]\r\n\r\nA public auto was arranged for December 20, 1694, but, so great was the\r\npopular revulsion of feeling against her, that it was not deemed safe to\r\nlet her appear in the procession from the Inquisition to the church of\r\nSan Domingo. She was secretly conveyed thither in a closed carriage two\r\nhours before day-break, and after the ceremonies she was not returned to\r\nthe tribunal with the other penitents. She was kept until late in the\r\nafternoon and then, by a back door, was placed in the carriage with two\r\npersons of rank. In spite of these precautions some boys divined the\r\ntruth and commenced stoning the carriage. Crowds gathered and a guard of\r\nsoldiers was brought, but to little purpose, for the stones flew thicker\r\nand thicker; one of the occupants was seriously injured and it was as\r\nthough by miracle that the carriage reached the Inquisition without\r\nbeing wrecked. Similar caution was observed in keeping her there for a\r\nmonth and conveying her to her place of reclusion. Meanwhile all over\r\nLima boys were celebrating mock autos, carrying her effigies in\r\nprocession and scourging and burning them.[692] It was probably the\r\nnumber and high station of her devotees that prevented a general\r\nprosecution, for only her three confessors, Ignacio Ixar, priest of San\r\nMarcelo, and the Augustinians, Fray José de Prado and Fray Agustin\r\nRoman, were arrested and tried.[693]\r\n\r\nAmong her revelations were some concerning an Indian tailor, Nicolás de\r\nAillon known as Nicolás de Dios, who died November 7, 1677, with the\r\nreputation of a servant of God, and was represented as having been\r\ncarried immediately to heaven by Christ, taking with him a crowd of\r\nsouls from purgatory. His widow sought to establish his sanctity and the\r\nJesuit, Bernardo Sartolo, wrote a book, published in Madrid in 1684, in\r\nwhich he accepted Angela’s story as true and praised without stint the\r\ntailor’s confessor, Fray Pedro de Avila Tamayo, who had been punished\r\nby the Inquisition as a scandalous corrupter of women in the\r\nconfessional. When the book reached Lima it excited a lively discussion\r\nand was prohibited by the tribunal. The efforts to canonize Aillon,\r\nhowever, were not relinquished, for, in 1711, papal letters were\r\nreceived by the archbishop, ordering him to collect information as to\r\nthe life and virtues of the candidate. What was done is not recorded,\r\nbut we may assume that the response caused the affair to be\r\ndropped.[694]\r\n\r\nThe popular detestation excited by Angela Carranza seems to have served\r\nas a deterrent on impostures of the kind, for no other cases are on\r\nrecord until about 1720, when a quadroon named María Josepha de la\r\nEncarnacion was prosecuted for visions and revelations. She was not\r\ntreated as leniently as Angela for, although she was perfectly harmless\r\nand had attempted no speculations on her devotees, and although, during\r\nher trial, she was so ill that she had to be transferred to a hospital,\r\nshe was visited with the cruel punishment of two hundred lashes through\r\nthe streets of Lima.[695] If subsequent cases occurred, their records\r\nhave failed to reach us.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMystic Illuminism and Quietism, which called for such energetic\r\nrepression by the Spanish tribunals, seem to have had little currency in\r\nthe more stagnant spiritual life of Peru. There is only one group of\r\ncases in the records, but these cast so much light on inquisitorial\r\nmethods that they deserve treatment in some detail.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1709, there died at Santiago de Chile the Jesuit Padre\r\nFrancisco de Ulloa, a man of little education but of high spiritual\r\ngifts, nourished on the mysticism of Tauler. He had devoted himself to\r\nthe direction of consciences and had a circle of about thirty devotees,\r\nmany of them nuns, who reverenced him as a saint. On his death-bed he\r\ncommitted his flock to another Jesuit, Padre Manuel de Ovalle, who found\r\non assuming charge that, although they confessed freely, he could not\r\npenetrate into the spiritual recesses of their souls. Suspecting that\r\nthere lay concealed the doctrines forbidden in Molinos, Madame Guyon and\r\nFénelon, he pretended to be himself in search of the higher spiritual\r\nexperiences; he drew up a series of propositions, among which were some\r\nof those condemned, and submitted it to a few of the leading spirits who\r\naccepted it, thus committing themselves to the dangerous doctrines of\r\nthe absolute abandonment of the soul to God, the non-resistance to\r\ntemptation, the idleness of exterior observances, and the impeccability\r\nof the confirmed adept. After six months spent in this pious treachery,\r\nand having secured written evidence of these heresies as entertained by\r\nJosé Solis and Pedro Ubau, he denounced them, June 14, 1710, to the\r\ntribunal of Lima, with all others whose names he had ascertained. He\r\nadmitted that Solis and Ubau, Doña Petronilla Covarrúbias, José\r\nGonzález, Doña Josefa Maturano and others, who were leaders among them,\r\nwere persons of pure life, and that some whose careers had been evil,\r\nafter practising the exercises prescribed by Ulloa, became virtuous and\r\ndeeply religious, but this had no bearing on their heresy. At Concepcion\r\nthere was another proselyte, Fray Felipe Chavarri, whose errors were\r\nshown by a letter which he enclosed. Still another leading spirit was\r\nJuan Francisco Velazco, an expelled Jesuit, who resisted Ovalle’s\r\nadvances. Some extravagances on his part attracted public attention and\r\nfinally became so marked that he was confined in the public prison.\r\n\r\nAnything akin to Molinism was regarded as dangerous in the highest\r\ndegree, but the Lima tribunal was so inert that it was not until\r\nDecember 10, 1712, that the Commissioner Manuel de Barona summoned\r\nOvalle to confirm his denunciation. On this same December 10th, another\r\nJesuit, Antonio María Fanelli, wrote to the tribunal enclosing some\r\nwritings of Solis and reciting the obstructions placed in the way of his\r\nattempts to have the affair investigated at Santiago, where all were\r\nconnected by intermarriages and friendships. The writings of Solis were\r\nsubmitted to a calificador, Maestro Dionisio Granado, who reported,\r\nDecember 22d, that they contained the heresies of Molinos, Luther and\r\nCalvin. After this there was a pause until February, 1714, when\r\nCommissioner Barona received further denunciations of Solis from the\r\nJesuit Claudio Cruzat and the Mercenarian Nicolás Nolasco. These were\r\nsoon followed by a deposition of Mariana González showing that Solis’s\r\nteachings were pure Illuminism of the Quietist school. She had been\r\nunder Ulloa’s direction for two years before his death, and he taught\r\nthe same doctrines. Altogether her testimony was of the most damaging\r\ncharacter, and she added the names of eighteen of Ulloa’s disciples.\r\nStirred by this Barona procured evidence from others of the group and\r\nsent the whole to the tribunal. On the strength of it the fiscal, August\r\n27th, presented a _clamosa_ against Solis as a follower of Molinos and\r\ndemanded his arrest with sequestration. Ibañez, who was sole inquisitor\r\nat the time, on September 1st signed a decree for the prosecution of all\r\nthe disciples of Ulloa, but on November 9th, in view of the importance\r\nof the case, he ordered a fresh _calificacion_ and inquiries to be made\r\nas to the standing of Ovalle. Fray Antonio Urraca was sent as a special\r\ncommissioner _ad hoc_ to Santiago to verify the evidence and gather\r\nfresh testimony.\r\n\r\nUrraca lost no time in proceeding to Santiago where he remained until\r\n1718 employed on the work, and it was not until February 10, 1719, that\r\nhe presented himself to the tribunal to report. Solis, Ubau and Velazco\r\nhad already been received as prisoners in November, 1718. In sending\r\nthem, Commissioner Barona stated that Solis, through poverty, had gone\r\nto the mines, where he had been arrested. Velazco had been crazy for two\r\nyears and was found on a ranch with no property but a poor bed. Ubau had\r\nfour thousand pesos in his possession; his arrest had caused great\r\nexcitement, for he was accountant for nuns and frailes, for the cabildo\r\nof the city and for merchants, universally respected for uprightness and\r\npunctual in his religious duties.\r\n\r\nThus far, although dilatory in action, the proceedings of the tribunal\r\nhad been unexceptionable. Molinism was an aberration that had excited\r\ntoo much abhorrence for any substantial accusation of it to be\r\nneglected. All reasonable effort had been made to obtain and to verify\r\nevidence; there seems to have been no desire to persecute the bulk of\r\nthe disciples of Ulloa and attention was concentrated on three who were\r\nregarded as leaders and dogmatizers. After this, however, there is much\r\nto criticize in the prosecutions. Ubau, who was perfectly sane when\r\nincarcerated, began to manifest symptoms of mental alienation which\r\ndeveloped into complete insanity. In February, 1733, he was transferred\r\nto the convent of the Recollects and finally to the insane department of\r\nthe hospital of San Andrés. Velazco pleaded that he had been insane for\r\nnine years, with lucid intervals; his health speedily broke down,\r\nconsumption set in and he was transferred, March 15, 1719, to the\r\nhospital of San Andrés where he died on the 19th and his body was\r\nreturned to the tribunal to be thrust into the ground. Proceedings were\r\ncontinued against his memory and fame, the advocate of prisoners arguing\r\nthat irresponsibility precluded his condemnation for formal heresy. As\r\nfor Solis, the accusation against him consisted of eighty articles and\r\nassumed that he was wholly an apostate from the faith. He protested that\r\nhe had persuaded himself that God had revealed to him the spiritual way;\r\nthis had been his fault, for which he begged mercy and was ready to\r\naccept any penance that might be imposed. His advocate defended him by\r\npointing out the deceitful way in which Ovalle had beguiled him into\r\nerror, by submitting to him propositions of Molinos which he had\r\nadmitted under examination that he did not understand. He had never even\r\nheard the name of Miguel de Molinos, so he could not be termed his\r\ndisciple and, if he had erred, it had been in following his confessor\r\nUlloa. As for Ulloa, the prosecution of his memory and fame was carried\r\nthrough its regular course. The accusation represented him as a\r\ndogmatizer of the heresies of Luther, Calvin, Molinos and Ubicler\r\n(Wickliffe). There were a hundred and sixty articles and twenty\r\nwitnesses to prove them. When a defender was called for, by command of\r\nthe Jesuit Provincial the procurador-general of the province of Chile\r\npresented himself and the most strenuous efforts were made to protect\r\nthe honor of the Society. Padre Firmin de Irisarri, who conducted the\r\ndefence, says that there was no proof that Ulloa had ever taught the\r\nworst of the propositions ascribed to him, and he throws the whole blame\r\non the artifice of Ovalle betraying three unlettered laymen into\r\naccepting doctrines which they were led to believe were entertained by\r\nhim to whom the dying Ulloa had entrusted them.\r\n\r\nAs far as the living were concerned, the cases were concluded and ready\r\nfor sentence in 1725. Then ensued an inexplicable delay until 1736, when\r\nCalderon and Unda were in control of the tribunal. The last _auto\r\ngeneral_ celebrated in Peru was announced for December 23d and was\r\nsolemnized in the public plaza, with exceptionally imposing ceremonies,\r\nin the presence of the viceroy, the Marquis of Villagarcía, and of all\r\nthe magnates. The effigies of Ulloa and Velazco were brought forward,\r\ncondemned and burnt; that of Solis was reconciled in view of his\r\nsubmission. The unfortunate Ubau, in spite of his insanity, had been\r\ncondemned, December 1st, to be relaxed as an impenitent heretic who\r\ndenied his guilt, and, as his mental condition would have precluded\r\nrepentance, he would have been burnt alive, but for some reason he was\r\nnot brought forward and was allowed to linger in the hospital until he\r\ndied in 1747. The sentence, however, confiscated his property which, as\r\nwe have seen (p. 353) amounted to more than sixty thousand pesos and\r\ndisappeared without leaving a trace. It would scarce be doing injustice\r\nto Calderon and Unda to suggest that the taking up of these cases, after\r\nten years’ interval, may have been to conceal the abstraction of the\r\nsequestration.[696]\r\n\r\nWhen the Visitador Arenaza and the Inquisitor Amusquíbar, in 1746,\r\narraigned their predecessors they laid special stress on the\r\nirregularities and excesses which characterized the conduct of these\r\ncases. In that of Ulloa, the consulta de fe voted _in discordia_;\r\nanother consulta was called, from which the two consultors who had voted\r\nin favor of the accused were excluded; another Ordinary, who had as\r\nconsultor condemned Ulloa’s papers, was substituted for the previous\r\none, and two new consultors were summoned, who were only allowed a\r\nmorning in which to examine the voluminous documents, and the consulta\r\nwas held on a feast-day when Ibañez refused to act.\r\n\r\nEven before this, however, the Suprema had commenced action. The Jesuits\r\nhad been profoundly stirred by the condemnation of Ulloa and the\r\nsuspension in the churches of the sanbenito of a member of their Order.\r\nIt was doubtless owing to their influence that the Suprema, March 10,\r\n1738, ordered all the papers in the case of the Molinists to be sent to\r\nSpain and the sanbenitos of Ulloa to be removed from the churches of\r\nLima and Santiago. This last command was unwillingly obeyed and, in\r\nreporting its execution, January 10, 1739, the tribunal remonstrated\r\nbitterly as to the disastrous results to the authority of the\r\nInquisition and to the faith. The papers were duly forwarded, but were\r\ndetained in Panamá until 1746, when they were despatched by way of\r\nBrazil. It was not, however, until 1762 that the Suprema delivered its\r\njudgement. It called attention to the many irregularities and\r\ninexcusable delays in the case of Solis, but did not modify the\r\njudgement. In that of Velazco, it revoked the sentence as unjust,\r\nabsolved his memory and fame, ordered his property to be restored to his\r\nheirs, less the expenses of maintenance, and that a certificate\r\nrehabilitating them be given and the sanbenitos be removed from the\r\nchurches. The review of the trial of Ulloa was long and minute, pointing\r\nout its innumerable irregularities and denials of justice; there was no\r\nproof that he ever held the doctrines imputed to him and no effort to\r\nascertain the truth; a false and imperfect report of the case, moreover,\r\nhad been made to the Suprema.[697]\r\n\r\nThere were six other disciples of Ulloa who were treated in the same\r\ninexcusable fashion. Two or three of them had appeared before the\r\nSantiago commissioner, in 1710 and 1718. Nothing more was done with them\r\nuntil the affair was revived for the auto of 1736, when they were\r\narrested and brought to Lima and tried. It is scarce worth while to\r\ndetail the cases. It suffices to say that two of them died in\r\nconsequence, and that in at least two of the cases the Suprema, in 1762,\r\nset aside the sentences as unjustifiable. The auto of 1736 had not\r\nescaped severe criticism in Lima, which the tribunal repressed by trying\r\ntwo of the critics and fining them in five hundred pesos each. A third\r\nwas a Jesuit, Padre Gabriel de Orduña, whom Calderon and Unda apparently\r\nwere afraid to handle. The evidence was sent to the Suprema, which\r\nreplied that Ibañez should summon him and warn him to treat the Holy\r\nOffice with due respect. This became known in Lima to the mortification\r\nof the inquisitors who suspended the case.[698]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the chief matter for which the tribunal was founded--the protection\r\nof the colony from the presumable missionary efforts of the\r\nProtestants--it found little to do. No case of proselytism has been\r\nfound among the records thus far and those of voluntary Protestant\r\nresidents are few and far between. The archbishop, as we have seen, had\r\ndisposed of Jan Miller in 1548, and in the first auto de fe, in 1573,\r\nthere appeared Joan Bautista and Mateo Salado. In 1581 there was a\r\ncourageous martyr in the person of Jan Bernal, a Flemish tailor who had\r\nbeen arrested and forwarded by the Commissioner of Panamá. At first he\r\nprofessed conversion and begged mercy, but he regained his fortitude and\r\ndeclared that it was better to burn in this world than the next. To this\r\nhe adhered in spite of strenuous efforts to convert him. He was tortured\r\n_in caput alienum_ without success and was sentenced to relaxation. He\r\nwas pertinacious to the last and must therefore undoubtedly have been\r\nburnt alive. In the auto of November 30, 1587, there appeared Miguel\r\ndel Pilar, a Fleming, whose constancy was punished by relaxation and\r\nburning.[699] Then a long interval occurs until 1625, when a man called\r\nAdrian Rodríguez of Leyden was induced to profess conversion and was\r\nreconciled with eight years of galleys and a sanbenito for life. A\r\ncentury elapses when, in 1730, there was an _autillo_ for Robert Shaw, a\r\nNova Scotian, who deserted from Clipperton’s expedition and penetrated\r\nto Cuzco, where he was arrested as a heretic and sent to Lima. He\r\nprofessed readiness for conversion and was confided for instruction to\r\nDr. Thomas Correy but soon ran away, carrying with him 160 pesos and\r\nsome jewels. He took service with a butcher in Puno, was discovered and\r\ntaken back to Lima, where he escaped with some spiritual penances. About\r\nten years later, James Haden of Boston was prosecuted as a heretic and\r\nwas converted.[700] The extreme sensitiveness which would not permit\r\nSpanish soil to be polluted by a Protestant foot is seen in the case of\r\nPierre Fos, a French Protestant of Protestant descent, who was cook to\r\nViceroy Superunda. He attended mass and passed for a Catholic, but\r\nbetrayed himself and was arrested in 1758. He confessed at once and said\r\nhe would become a Catholic if he could obtain his parents’ consent;\r\nthen, after three days of prison, he announced his conversion to save\r\nhis soul. Instructors were given to him and his trial dragged on through\r\nall its cumbrous forms until his sentence was read in an auto of May 18,\r\n1763. It condemned him to abjure _de vehementi_, to be paraded in\r\n_virgüenza_ through the streets, to confiscation of half his property,\r\nreclusion for instruction during two years, after which he was to be\r\nshipped to Spain, consigned to the commissioner at Cádiz. The last\r\npapers in the case are the receipt for his person by the captain of the\r\ngood ship los Placeres, Callao, April 2, 1765, and the receipt from the\r\nreceiver, April 22d, for the documents concerning his property. It was\r\ndoubtless his pretended Catholicism that justified this severity.[701]\r\n\r\nIt is a curious illustration of the Spanish theories concerning heresy\r\nand its cognizance by the Inquisition that even heretics, whose presence\r\nwas involuntary as prisoners of war, were held to come within its\r\njurisdiction, and the Lima tribunal had much more to do with such\r\nsubjects than with those who ventured intentionally within its grasp. In\r\n1578 it wrote to Juan Constantino, its commissioner at Panamá, that it\r\nunderstood that the English corsairs who appeared there were heretics\r\nand that it would proceed as such against any who were captured. They\r\nrobbed the commissioner and left him in his shirt, they broke the\r\nchalice and patena and cast into the sea the altar and missal. The\r\ncommissioner on his part denounced the General of the armada del Mar de\r\nNorte for keeping in his service two or three Englishmen as trumpeters\r\nand an artilleryman, whom he ought to have delivered to the Inquisition\r\nof Seville.[702] Sometimes the secular authorities maintained a\r\ncumulative jurisdiction with a result grotesquely horrible. Thus, in\r\n1581 there were four English prisoners surrendered to the tribunal which\r\ntortured them severely for intention and sentenced John Oxenham,\r\n“captain of the robbers at Ballano,” to reconciliation, confiscation and\r\nthe galleys for life; Thomas Xervel (Harvey?), master of the ship, to\r\nreconciliation, ten years of galleys and subsequent perpetual prison;\r\nJohn Butler, pilot of the ship, to abjure _de vehementi_ and six years\r\nof galleys; the fourth, Henry Butler, a young brother of the last, was\r\nnot tried. It sounds like a ghastly jest to learn that the alcaldes had\r\nalready sentenced the first three to be hanged and the last one to\r\nperpetual galleys; they were all returned to the secular court and the\r\nsentences were duly executed. As they had evidently all been converted,\r\nthe tribunal at least had the pious satisfaction of saving their\r\nsouls.[703] About 1585 there is a brief entry of a dozen or so of\r\nEnglishmen captured at Guayaquil and taken to Lima. The Viceroy Count\r\ndel Villar asked them whether they were baptized and on learning that\r\nthey were thus answerable to the Inquisition, he handed them over to the\r\ntribunal. What were their sentences and whether the secular court\r\nreclaimed them does not appear.[704]\r\n\r\nThe next adventurers who suffered appeared in the auto of November 30,\r\n1587. John Drake, a cousin of Sir Francis, passed the Straits of\r\nMagellan and was lost on the Pacific coast. Thirteen of the crew saved\r\nthemselves and fell among cannibal Indians with whom they lived for\r\nabout a year. Drake and two others fled in a canoe down the River Plate\r\nto Buenos Ayres, one of them being lost in the Paraguay. Drake and his\r\ncomrade Richard Ferrel were seized, sent across the continent to Arica\r\nand thence to Lima, where they were tried by the tribunal. They\r\nprofessed conversion; Drake was sentenced to reconciliation and\r\nseclusion for three years in a monastery with prohibition to leave the\r\ncountry. Ferrel must have been somewhat more stubborn, for he was\r\ntortured and condemned to reconciliation, four years of galleys and\r\nperpetual prison.[705]\r\n\r\nThe auto of April 5, 1592, was graced with two groups of English\r\nprisoners. Four of these had been captured on the island of Puná and had\r\nlain in prison for five years. The secular authorities seem to have\r\nabandoned jurisdiction by this time and left them wholly to the\r\nInquisition. Walter and Edward Tillert, brothers, were relaxed as\r\npersistent heretics, but weakened at the last moment and were strangled\r\nbefore burning. Henry Axli (Oxley?) was pertinacious to the end and was\r\nburnt alive. The fourth, Andrew Marle (Morley?), a youth of eighteen,\r\nprofessed conversion and was reconciled, with two years reclusion among\r\nthe Jesuits for instruction.[706]\r\n\r\nThe other group consisted of three “pirates,” from the expedition of\r\nThomas Cavendish, who sailed from Plymouth July 21, 1586. He reached the\r\nStraits of Magellan January 3, 1587, emerged March 15th and on April 9th\r\nanchored in the roadstead of Quintero, a little north of Valparaiso. At\r\nSantiago a force had been raised in anticipation of their coming, and\r\nwhen the English, in need of wood and water, had landed a party, they\r\nsurrounded twelve men, who had straggled to a ravine, and carried them\r\nto Santiago. There nine of them were summarily hanged, to the great\r\nbenefit of their souls, for they professed conversion. The other three\r\nwere shipped to Lima, and delivered to the Inquisition where their\r\ntrials lasted for three years. Of these William Stephens said his\r\nparents were both Catholics, and his mother had died in gaol for\r\npossessing beads and images; he had observed the religion of his country\r\nbut was in heart a Catholic; he was reconciled with four years prison\r\nand sanbenito. Thomas Lucas had a Protestant father and Catholic mother;\r\nhe had always been a Protestant but was now a Catholic; he was\r\nreconciled, with four years of galleys, six years of prison and\r\nsanbenito, and was never to leave Lima. William Hilles was but 17 years\r\nold; he had been a Protestant but was now a Catholic; he was reconciled,\r\nwith six years of galleys and perpetual prison and sanbenito.[707]\r\nCavendish, it may be added, captured a treasure-ship, imitated Drake in\r\ncircumnavigating the globe and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nMore disastrous was the expedition under Richard Hawkins, which sailed\r\nfrom Plymouth in July, 1593, with three vessels, of which one was\r\nwrecked and one returned. Hawkins cast anchor at Valparaiso, April 24,\r\n1594, where he captured four little vessels and ransomed a larger one.\r\nWhen he sailed, the corregidor manned one of the abandoned barks and\r\ndespatched it to Callao with news of the corsairs. It made the voyage in\r\nfifteen days, enabling the Viceroy, Hurtado de Mendoza, to fit out a\r\nsquadron under his nephew Beltran de Castro, who encountered Hawkins,\r\nJuly 2, in the Bay of Atacames, near Quito. After a desperate fight,\r\nHawkins surrendered under promise of treatment as prisoners of war, and\r\nthe extraordinary rejoicings with which the news of the victory were\r\nreceived in Lima are a measure of the terror excited by these dauntless\r\nsea-rovers. The terms of capitulation were scandalously violated; of the\r\nseventy-five prisoners taken, sixty-two were sent to the galleys at\r\nCartagena, and thirteen were brought to Lima, where the Inquisition\r\nclaimed them, on information that they were heretics, and they entered\r\nthe secret prison, December 4, 1594. Possibly it may have been the\r\nirregularity attaching to the infraction of the terms of surrender that\r\nhastened the trials, for eight of the prisoners appeared in the auto of\r\nDecember 17, 1595, together with seven other Englishmen, captured at la\r\nYaguana and forwarded from Santo Domingo. There were no martyrs among\r\nthem. All professed conversion and were reconciled with various terms of\r\nreclusion except one, William Leigh, who was sentenced to six years of\r\ngalleys and perpetual irremissible prison.[708]\r\n\r\nRichard Hawkins, whose trial ended July 17, 1595, was too sick to appear\r\nin the auto and was transferred to the Jesuit college. His chivalrous\r\nbearing won for him general good will, and on his recovery he was placed\r\nat the disposition of the viceroy who was earnestly desirous that the\r\nterms of surrender should be observed. There was correspondence on the\r\nsubject. The Suprema wrote, October 5, 1595, to suspend the\r\nsequestrations of the Englishmen, and in future not to sequestrate in\r\nsuch cases, for soldiers ought not to be deprived of the spoils won from\r\ntheir enemies. The tribunal, it said, was not to interfere in the cases\r\nof those sent to the galleys at Cartagena, but, as to Hawkins and his\r\ncomrades, they were to be delivered to the viceroy, without proceeding\r\nfurther in their cases and, when they were fully instructed in the\r\nfaith, it was to do justice, proceeding in their cases with much care\r\nand consideration. These instructions were of course too late, and in\r\nreply the tribunal asked whether their sanbenitos should be removed from\r\nthe churches and whether, in case they relapsed, they should be subject\r\nto relaxation. The conclusion reached was that the sanbenitos were to be\r\nremoved, the reclusion revoked, the sequestrations restored and that\r\nthey were not subject to the penalties of relapse for reincidence. The\r\nsucceeding viceroy, Velasco, desired to send them all to Spain, but this\r\nwas opposed by the tribunal because their penances had not been\r\ncompleted; Hawkins ought also to be kept on account of his knowledge of\r\nthe navigation of those seas. The last information concerning them\r\noccurs in a letter of the Royal Audiencia, May 21, 1607, showing that\r\nthey had passed out of the hands of the tribunal. It says that the\r\nViceroys Cañete and Velasco had sent to Spain all those captured in 1594\r\nexcept Richard Hawkins, Captain John Ellis, Hugh Carnix (Charnock?) and\r\nRichard Davis, who were kept because they were experienced seamen and\r\nDavis was useful in the position assigned to him. Now permission has\r\nbeen given to them to sail in the outgoing fleet, consigned to the\r\nContratacion of Seville.[709] We know that Hawkins eventually reached\r\nEngland and was knighted.\r\n\r\nIn time there came a recognition of the rights of prisoners of war, even\r\nthough they were heretics and were claimed by the Inquisition. In the\r\nauto of December 21, 1625, there appeared Pieter Jan of Delft, who had\r\nbeen captured and condemned to death as a pirate, though the sentence\r\nwas not executed. He refused to be converted and was sent to the\r\ngalleys, but was subsequently liberated under a royal cédula as a\r\nprisoner of war. Fanaticism, however, was difficult to extinguish. When,\r\nabout 1650, the Dutch endeavored to establish themselves at Valdivia,\r\nViceroy Mancera sent a well-equipped fleet and army to drive them out.\r\nThe captain of the first vessel that reached there, on learning that the\r\nDutch commander had died and been buried, caused the corpse to be dug up\r\nand burnt. From the absence in the subsequent records of cases of\r\nprisoners of war, however, it is safe to assume that by this time the\r\nbarbarity of giving them the alternative of conversion or the stake had\r\nbeen abandoned. There was, it is true, an intervention of the tribunal\r\nin the case of the Dutch ship St. Louis, captured at Coquimbo in 1725,\r\nbut it was not unreasonable. The fiscal Calderon, learning that among\r\nthe prisoners there were French Huguenots and Dutch heretics and Jews,\r\nand that the Viceroy Castelfuerte thought of utilizing the sailors on\r\nhis own ships, represented to the tribunal the grave dangers of such a\r\ncourse, when the Inquisitor Gutiérrez de Cevallos, induced the viceroy\r\nto abandon the plan and to bring to Lima about a hundred who had been\r\nleft sick at Coquimbo.[710] As none of them appeared in the succeeding\r\nauto it is inferable that they were not subjected to prosecution for\r\nheresy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe most serious business of the tribunal, in the line of its proper\r\nfunctions, was with the apostasy of the Jewish New Christians. From the\r\nvery foundation of the colonies, as we have seen in the preceding\r\nchapter, restrictions were laid on the emigration of Conversos and a law\r\nof 1543, preserved in the Recopilacion, orders that search be made for\r\nall descendants of Jews who were to be rigorously expelled.[711] In\r\nspite, however, of the jealous care observed to preserve the colonies\r\nfrom all danger of Jewish infection, the commercial attractions were so\r\npowerful that the New Christians eluded all precautions. At first,\r\nhowever, they occupied but a small portion of the energies of the\r\ntribunal. It is true that among the earliest denunciations received, in\r\n1570, were those of the Licenciate Juan Alvarez, a physician, and of his\r\nbrother-in-law Alonso Alvarez with his wife, children and servants, for\r\nJudaism, but as their names are absent from the subsequent auto it is\r\npresumable that they were found innocent.[712] The first appearance of\r\nJews is in the auto of October 29, 1581, when Manuel López, a\r\nPortuguese, was reconciled with confiscation and perpetual prison, and\r\nDiego de la Rosa, described as a native of Quito, was required to abjure\r\n_de levi_ and was exiled--showing that the evidence against him was very\r\ndubious.[713] After this there are none until the great auto of April 5,\r\n1592, in which there were two, Nicholas Morin, a Frenchman, and\r\nFrancisco Díaz, a Portuguese, the former required to abjure _de levi_\r\nand the latter reconciled.[714]\r\n\r\nThe conquest of Portugal, in 1580, had led to a large emigration to\r\nCastile, where Portuguese soon became synonymous with Judaizer, and this\r\nwas beginning to make itself manifest in the colonies. The auto of\r\nDecember 17, 1595, gave impressive evidence of this. Five\r\nPortuguese--Juan Méndez, Antonio Núñez, Juan López, Francisco Báez and\r\nManuel Rodríguez--were reconciled. Another, Herman Jorje, had died\r\nduring trial and his memory was not prosecuted. There were also four\r\nmartyrs. Jorje Núñez denied until he was tied upon the rack; he then\r\nconfessed and refused to be converted, but after his sentence of\r\nrelaxation was read he weakened and was strangled before burning.\r\nFrancisco Rodríguez endured torture without confessing; when threatened\r\nwith repetition he endeavored unsuccessfully to commit suicide; he was\r\nvoted to relaxation with torture _in caput alienum_, and under it he\r\naccused several persons but revoked at ratification. He was pertinacious\r\nto the last and was burnt alive. Juan Fernández was relaxed, although\r\ninsane; the Suprema expressed doubts whether he had intelligence enough\r\nto render him responsible. Pedro de Contreras had been tortured for\r\nconfession and again _in caput alienum_; he denied Judaism throughout\r\nand was relaxed as a _negativo_; at the auto he manifested great\r\ndevotion to a crucifix and presumably was strangled; in all probability\r\nhe was really a Christian.[715]\r\n\r\nThis bloody work affords a foretaste of what was to come. At the auto of\r\nDecember 10, 1600, there were fourteen Portuguese Judaizers. Twelve of\r\nthem had professed conversion and were reconciled; with two, convictions\r\nwere too strong and they were burnt alive--Duarte Núñez de Cea and\r\nBaltasar Lucena, whose last words were that he denied Christ.[716] The\r\nauto of March 13, 1605, exhibited sixteen Judaizers reconciled in person\r\nand one in effigy. Six who had fled were burnt in effigy and three less\r\nfortunate were burnt in person. Besides these was Antonio Corrca who,\r\nduring his trial, was converted by the inspiration of God; he was\r\nreconciled with three years in prison, which he served in the convent of\r\nla Merced and then was sent to Spain, dying, in 1622, as a fraile in\r\nOssuna, in the odor of sanctity, which has rendered him the subject of\r\nseveral biographies.[717]\r\n\r\nThe auto of June 1, 1608, afforded but one case, and that an unusual\r\none--Domingo López, tried for Judaism and acquitted. This may be\r\nexplained by the fact that the Portuguese New Christians had purchased,\r\nin 1604, a general pardon in Spain, which reached Peru in 1605 and for a\r\ntime repressed inquisitorial activity in this direction. In 1610 there\r\nwas a noteworthy case of Manuel Ramos, one of the fugitives who had been\r\nburnt in effigy in 1605. He had been captured and on being tried was now\r\nacquitted.[718] In an auto of June 17, 1612, there were five\r\nreconciliations for Judaism.[719] From this time for some years there\r\nwere only scattering cases. Possibly the terrible energy manifested by\r\nthe tribunal had served as a deterrent and checked the Portuguese\r\ninflux, but if so the impression was but temporary. We have seen (p.\r\n337) the complaints that arose about this time concerning the Portuguese\r\nimmigration by way of Brazil and Buenos Ayres. This increased greatly\r\nwhen, in 1618, a Portuguese inquisitor came to Rio de Janeiro, published\r\nan Edict of Faith and then in a few days made many arrests and\r\nsequestrated property to the amount of more than 200,000 pesos. The\r\nfrightened Judaizers sought refuge in Spanish territory and kept the\r\ncommissioner at Buenos Ayres, Francisco de Trejo, in a state of\r\ncontinual anxiety. He reported, January 15, 1619, that since the new\r\ngovernor, Diego Martin, had come the _visitas de navíos_ had been\r\ninterrupted and he asked for such positive instructions that the\r\nauthorities should understand that no foreigners could land until he had\r\ninspected the ship. His protests were unavailing. By the middle of April\r\nthere had arrived eight ships bringing Portuguese passengers, who had\r\npaid Castilians to take them as servants so that they might enter.\r\nGovernor Martin was alert and threw them in prison, in order to send\r\nthem back, but many managed to get through. Some of them were married in\r\nprison to Buenos Ayres women, so as to give them a standing in the\r\ncommunity; others broke gaol and took refuge in convents, when the\r\nfrailes refused to surrender them, giving security to the governor that\r\nthey would prove themselves to be not of the prohibited class, whereupon\r\nthey scattered to the interior and the man who had furnished the\r\nsecurity calmly paid the forfeit. It is true that forty of them were\r\nsent back, but it was evidently impossible to exclude these proscribed\r\nand hunted beings who were so persistent and resourceful. The tribunal,\r\nin fact, was apparently not averse to obtaining fresh material for\r\ncondemnation and confiscation, for it did not authorize the commissioner\r\nto arrest suspects and send them back, but only to compile information\r\nabout them and forward it to Lima, keeping advised as to their\r\ndestinations so that they could be seized when wanted.[720] The\r\nimmigration continued and, in 1623, the tribunal called the attention of\r\nthe Suprema to the increasing numbers of Portuguese, who were spreading\r\nthroughout the interior provinces. This continued and, in 1635, the\r\nfiscal of the Audiencia of Charcas represented forcibly to the king the\r\nevil of the innumerable Jews who had entered and were constantly\r\ncoming.[721]\r\n\r\nThe tribunal resumed its labors and, by December 21, 1625, it was ready\r\nwith an auto in which ten Judaizers were reconciled. Two had committed\r\nsuicide in prison and were burnt with their bones. Two more were\r\nrelaxed--Juan Acuña de Noroña, who was described as impenitent and must\r\nhave been burnt alive, and Diego de Andrada who gave signs of repentance\r\nat the last and was probably strangled before burning.[722]\r\n\r\nIn 1626 there commenced a trial which illustrates forcibly the\r\ninexorable discipline of the Church, rendering it the supreme duty of\r\nthe Christian to persecute and destroy all heresy. Francisco Maldonado\r\nde Silva was a surgeon of high repute in Concepcion de Chile. He was of\r\nPortuguese descent. His father had suffered in the Inquisition, had been\r\nreconciled and brought up his children, two girls and a boy, as\r\nChristians. Francisco was a good Catholic until, at the age of 18, he\r\nchanced to read the _Scrutinium Scripturarum_ of Pablo de Santa María,\r\nBishop of Búrgos--a controversial work written for the conversion of\r\nJews.[723] So far from confirming him in the faith it raised doubts\r\nleading him to consult his father, who told him to study the Bible and\r\ninstructed him in the Law of Moses. He became an ardent convert to\r\nJudaism, but kept his secret from his mother and two sisters and from\r\nhis wife, for he was married and had a child, and his wife was pregnant\r\nwhen he was arrested. During her absence, a year or two before, he had\r\ncircumcised himself. At the age of 35, considering that his sister\r\nIsabel who was about 33, was mature enough for religious independence,\r\nhe revealed his secret to her and endeavored to convert her, but in\r\nvain, and he was impervious to her entreaties to abandon his faith. They\r\nseem to have been tenderly attached to each other; he was her sole\r\nsupport as well as that of her mother and sister, but she could not\r\nescape the necessity of communicating the facts in confession to her\r\nconfessor. The prescriptions of the Church were absolute; no family ties\r\nrelieved one from the obligation of denouncing heresy, and she could not\r\nhope for sacramental absolution without discharging the duty. We can\r\npicture to ourselves the torment of that agonized soul as she nerved\r\nherself to the awful duty which would cost her a lifetime of remorse and\r\nmisery when she obeyed her confessor’s commands and denounced her\r\nbrother to the Inquisition.\r\n\r\nThe warrant for his arrest was issued December 12, 1626, and executed at\r\nConcepcion April 29, 1627. His friend, the Dominican Fray Diego de\r\nUreña, visited him in his place of confinement, May 2, and sought to\r\nconvert him, but he was resolved to die in the faith in which his father\r\nhad died. So when transferred to Santiago, the Augustinian Fray Alonso\r\nde Almeida made similar efforts with like ill-success; he knew that he\r\nshould die for the faith, he had never spoken to any one but his sister\r\nand she had betrayed him. He was received in Lima July 23d and was\r\nadmitted to an audience the same day. When required to swear on the\r\ncross he refused, saying that he was a Jew and would live and die as\r\nsuch; if he had to swear it would be by the living God, the God of\r\nIsrael. His trial went on through all the customary formalities,\r\nprotracted by the repeated conferences held with theologians who\r\nendeavored to convince him of his errors. Eleven of these were held\r\nwithout weakening his pertinacity until, on January 26, 1633, the\r\nconsulta de fe unanimously condemned him to relaxation.\r\n\r\nA long sickness followed, caused by a fast of eighty days which had\r\nreduced him almost to a skeleton covered with sores. On convalescing, he\r\nasked for another conference, to solve the doubts which he had drawn up\r\nin writing. It was held June 26, 1634, and left him as pertinacious as\r\never. Meanwhile the prison was filling with Judaizers, of whom a number\r\nhad been discovered in Lima. He asked for maize husks in place of his\r\nration of bread, and with them made a rope by which he escaped through a\r\nwindow and visited two neighboring cells, urging the prisoners to be\r\nsteadfast in their law; they denounced him and he made no secret of it,\r\nconfessing freely what he had done. It was a mercy of God, we are told,\r\nthat his prolonged fast had rendered him deaf, or he would have learned\r\nmuch from them of what had been going on.\r\n\r\nThe tribunal was so preoccupied, with the numerous trials on foot at\r\nthe time, that Maldonado was left undisturbed, awaiting the general auto\r\nthat was to follow. We hear nothing more until, after an interval of\r\nfour years, a thirteenth conference was held at his request, November\r\n12, 1638. It was as fruitless as its predecessors and, at its\r\nconclusion, he produced two books (each of them of more than a hundred\r\nleaves), made with marvellous ingenuity out of scraps of paper and\r\nwritten with ink made of charcoal and pens cut out of egg-shells with a\r\nknife fashioned from a nail, which he said he delivered up for the\r\ndischarge of his conscience. Then on December 9th and 10th were held two\r\nmore conferences in which his pertinacity remained unshaken. The long\r\ntragedy was now drawing to an end after an imprisonment which had lasted\r\nfor nearly thirteen years. He was brought out in the great auto of\r\nJanuary 23, 1639, where, when the sentences of relaxation were read, a\r\nsudden whirlwind tore away the awning and, looking up, he exclaimed “The\r\nGod of Israel does this to look upon me face to face!” He was\r\nunshrinking to the last and was burnt alive a true martyr to his faith.\r\nHis two paper books were hung around his neck to burn with him and\r\nassist in burning him.[724]\r\n\r\nThis auto of 1639, the greatest that had as yet been held in the New\r\nWorld, was the culmination of the “complicidad grande”--the name given\r\nby the inquisitors to a number of Judaizers whom they had discovered. As\r\nthey described the situation, in a report of 1636, large numbers of\r\nPortuguese had entered the kingdom by way of Buenos Ayres, Brazil,\r\nMexico, Granada and Puerto Bello, thus increasing the already numerous\r\nbands of their compatriots. They became masters of the commerce of the\r\nkingdom; from brocade to sack-cloth, from diamonds to cumin-seed,\r\neverything passed through their hands; the Castilian who had not a\r\nPortuguese partner could look for no success in trade. They would buy\r\nthe cargoes of whole fleets with the fictitious credits which they\r\nexchanged, thus rendering capital unnecessary, and would distribute the\r\nmerchandise throughout the land by their agents, who were likewise\r\nPortuguese, and their capacity developed until, in 1634, they negotiated\r\nfor the farming of the royal customs.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1634, Joan de Salazar, a merchant, denounced to the\r\nInquisition Antonio Cordero, clerk of a trader from Seville, because he\r\nrefused to make a sale on a Saturday. On another occasion, going to his\r\nstore on a Friday morning, he found Cordero breakfasting on a piece of\r\nbread and an apple and, on asking him whether he had not better take a\r\nrasher of bacon, Cordero replied “Must I eat what my father and\r\ngrandfather never ate?” The evidence was weak and no immediate action\r\nwas taken, but, in October, the commissioners were instructed secretly\r\nto ascertain and report the number of Portuguese in their several\r\ndistricts. The matter rested and, as nothing new was developed, in\r\nMarch, 1635, the evidence against Cordero was laid before a consulta de\r\nfe and it was resolved to arrest him secretly, without sequestration, so\r\nthat the hand of the Inquisition might not be apparent. Bartolomé de\r\nLarrea, a familiar, called on him, April 2d, under pretence of settling\r\nan account, and locked him in a room; a sedan-chair was brought, and he\r\nwas conveyed to the secret prison. His disappearance excited much talk\r\nand he was supposed to have fled, for the supposition of arrest by the\r\nInquisition was scouted, seeing that there had not been sequestration.\r\n\r\nCordero confessed at once that he was a Jew and, under torture,\r\nimplicated his employer and two others. These were arrested on May 11th\r\nand the free employment of torture obtained the names of numerous\r\naccomplices. The prisons were full and to empty them an auto in the\r\nchapel was hurriedly arranged and preparations were made for the hasty\r\nconstruction of additional cells. On August 11th, between 12.30 and 2\r\no’clock, seventeen arrests were made, so quietly and simultaneously that\r\nit was all effected before the people were conscious of it. These were\r\namong the most prominent citizens and greatest merchants of Lima, and\r\nwe are told that the impression produced on the community was like the\r\nDay of Judgement. Torture and inquisitorial methods elicited further\r\ninformation resulting in additional arrests; the affrighted Portuguese\r\nbegan to scatter and, at the request of the tribunal, the Viceroy\r\nChinchon prohibited for a year any one to leave Peru without its\r\nlicence.\r\n\r\nUp to May 16, 1636, the date of a report made to the Suprema, there had\r\nbeen eighty-one arrests; there was evidence against eighty more but, for\r\nlack of prison accommodation, their seizure was postponed. The old\r\nprison had sixteen cells, nineteen new ones had been constructed, then\r\nan adjoining house was bought and seventeen more were fitted up in it.\r\nThis influx of wealthy prisoners put the fidelity of the gaolers to a\r\nstrain which it could not stand. The old alcaide, Bartolomé de Pradeda,\r\nexcited suspicion by buying property beyond his legitimate means; he was\r\ninvestigated and found to be selling favors to those under his charge,\r\nrevealing secrets, permitting communications and the like. He deserved\r\nsevere punishment but, in view of his twenty years of service, his seven\r\nchildren and his infirm health, he was allowed to ask permission to\r\nretire to his country place. He was replaced by Diego de Vargas, who\r\nsoon had to be dismissed for the same reasons. Joseph Freile was\r\nappointed assistant, but was soon found guilty of similar offences and\r\nwas sent to the galleys. His successor was Benito Rodríguez, who\r\nlikewise succumbed to temptation, but he was a familiar and was only\r\ndropped. Another was Francisco Hurtado de Valcázar, who subsequently\r\nappeared in an auto for the same reasons.\r\n\r\nOne matter which vexed the souls of the inquisitors was the effort made\r\nby the threatened Portuguese to hide their property from sequestration.\r\nA proclamation was issued, ordering all who knew of such matters to\r\nreveal them within nine days under pain of excommunication and other\r\npenalties. This was successful to some extent, but the difficulties in\r\nthe way were illustrated in the case of Enrique de Paz, for whom Melchor\r\nde los Reies secreted much silver, jewels and merchandise. Among other\r\nthings he deposited with his friend Don Dionisio Manrique, Knight of\r\nSantiago, senior alcalde de corte and a consultor of the tribunal, a\r\nquantity of silver and some fifty or sixty pieces of rich silks.\r\nManrique did not deny receiving them, but said that the same night\r\nMelchor ordered them taken away by a young man who was a stranger to\r\nhim. The inquisitors evidently disbelieved the story; they reported that\r\nthey had unsuccessfully tried friendly methods with Manrique and asked\r\nthe Suprema for instructions.\r\n\r\nThe sequestration of so much property brought all trade to a stand-still\r\nand produced indescribable confusion, aggravated, in 1635, by the\r\nconsequent failure of the bank. The men arrested had nearly all the\r\ntrade of the colony in their hands; they were involved in an infinity of\r\ncomplicated transactions and suits sprang up on all sides. Creditors and\r\nsuitors pressed their claims desperately, fearing that with delay\r\nwitnesses might disappear, in the widening circle of arrests. There were\r\nmany suits pending already in the Audiencia which were claimed by the\r\ntribunal and surrendered to it. It was puzzled by the new business thus\r\nthrown upon it; to a suit there had to be two parties, but the prisoners\r\ncould not plead, so it appointed Manuel de Monte Alegre as their\r\n“defensor” to appear for them, and it went on hearing and deciding\r\ncomplicated civil suits while conducting the prosecutions for heresy.\r\nMondays and Thursdays were assigned for civil business, and every\r\nafternoon, from 3 P.M. until dark, was devoted to examination of\r\ndocuments. The inquisitors claimed that they pushed forward strenuously\r\nin settling accounts and paying debts, for otherwise all commerce would\r\nbe destroyed to the irreparable damage of the Republic, which was\r\nalready exhausted in so many ways. This did not suit the Suprema, which,\r\nby letters of October 22d and November 9, 1635, forbade the surrender of\r\nany sequestrated or confiscated property, no matter what evidence was\r\nproduced of ownership or claims, without first consulting it. This\r\nexacting payment of all debts and postponing payment of claims\r\nthreatened general bankruptcy when the rich merchants were arrested, for\r\ntheir aggregate liabilities amounted to eight hundred thousand pesos,\r\nwhich was estimated as equal to the whole capital of Lima. To avert\r\nthis, some payments were made, but only on the strength of competent\r\nsecurity being furnished.\r\n\r\nIn the excitement of the hour and the mad rush for arresting everybody\r\nwho might be an apostate, much injustice was committed which aggravated\r\nthe confusion. Thus on May 8, 1636, Santiago del Castillo, was arrested,\r\na merchant whose licence to sail for Spain was to be signed that\r\nafternoon. With him were seized fifty-five bars of silver and ten\r\nthousand pesos in coin; he was administrator of customs and it was\r\nreckoned fortunate that over thirty thousand pesos belonging to the king\r\nhad been handed over so that it could be sent by the fleet. He was\r\nreceiver in the bankruptcy of Joan de la Queba, and as such held about\r\nseven thousand pesos which were given to Judge Martin de Arriola to be\r\napportioned among eight hundred creditors. Castillo’s estate was large\r\nbut he was involved in suits, besides holding considerable property\r\nbelonging to others, and claims began at once to be presented. All this\r\nwas wholly superfluous, for on October 23, 1637, he was discharged as\r\ninnocent and the sequestration was lifted. Alonso Sánchez Chaparro was\r\nliberated, February 9, 1637, and more than sixty thousand pesos were\r\nreturned to him. There were several other acquittals, and a number of\r\ncases were suspended involving the release of large sums which ought\r\nnever to have been tied up.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the trials of the accused were pushed forward as rapidly as\r\nthe perplexities of the situation admitted. Torture was not spared.\r\nMurcia de Luna, a woman of 27, died under it. Antonio de Acuña was\r\nsubjected to it for three hours and, when he was carried out, Alcaide\r\nPradeda described his arms as being torn to pieces. Progress was\r\nimpeded, however, by the devices of the prisoners, who were in hopes\r\nthat influences at work in Spain would secure a general pardon like that\r\nof 1604. With this object they revoked their confessions and their\r\naccusations of each other, giving rise to endless complications. Some of\r\nthe latter revocations, however, were genuine and were adhered to, even\r\nthrough the torture which was freely used in these cases. Besides this,\r\nto cast doubt on the whole affair, they accused the innocent and even\r\nOld Christians, which accounts for the acquittals mentioned above. The\r\ninquisitors add that they abstained in many cases from making arrests,\r\nwhen the testimony was insufficient and the parties were not Portuguese.\r\n\r\nThe tribunal was manned with four inquisitors, who struggled resolutely\r\nthrough this complicated mass of business, and at length were ready to\r\nmake public the results of their labors in the auto of January 23, 1639.\r\nThis was celebrated with unexampled pomp and ostentation, for now money\r\nwas abundant and the opportunity of making an impression on the popular\r\nmind was not to be lost. During the previous night, when their sentences\r\nwere made known to those who were to be relaxed, two of them, Enrique de\r\nPaz and Manuel de Espinosa, professed conversion; the inquisitors came\r\nand examined them, a consulta was assembled and they were admitted to\r\nreconciliation. There was great rivalry among men of position for the\r\nhonor of accompanying the penitents and Don Salvadoro Velázquez, one of\r\nthe principal Indians, _sargento mayor_ of the Indian militia, begged to\r\nbe allowed to carry one of the effigies, which he did in resplendent\r\nuniform. Conspicuous in a place of honor in the procession were the\r\nseven who had been acquitted, richly dressed, mounted on white horses\r\nand carrying palms of victory.\r\n\r\nBesides the Judaizers there were a bigamist and five women penanced for\r\nsorcery. There was also the alcaide’s assistant Valcázar, who was\r\ndeprived of his familiarship and was exiled for four years. Juan de\r\nCanelas Albarran, the occupant of a house adjoining the prison, who had\r\npermitted an opening through the walls for communications, received a\r\nhundred lashes and five years of exile, and Ana María González, who was\r\nconcerned in the matter, had also a hundred lashes and four years of\r\nexile.\r\n\r\nOf the Judaizers there were seven who escaped with abjuration _de\r\nvehementi_, various penalties and fines aggregating eight hundred pesos.\r\nThere were forty-four reconciled with punishments varied according to\r\ntheir deserts. Those who had confessed readily as to themselves and\r\nothers were let off with confiscation and deportation to Spain. Those\r\nwho prevaricated or gave trouble had, in addition, lashes or galleys or\r\nboth. Of these there were twenty-one, the aggregate lashes amounting to\r\nfour thousand and the years of galleys to a hundred and six, besides two\r\ncondemnations for life. In addition to these were the mother of the\r\nMurcia de Luna who died under torture, Doña Mayor de Luna, a woman of\r\nhigh social position, and her daughter Doña Isabel de Luna, a girl of\r\n18, who, for endeavoring to communicate with each other in prison, were\r\nsentenced to a hundred lashes through the streets, naked from the waist\r\nup. There was also one reconciliation in effigy of a culprit who had\r\ndied in prison.\r\n\r\nThere were eleven relaxations in person and the effigy of one who had\r\ncommitted suicide during trial. Of the eleven, seven are said to have\r\ndied pertinacious and impenitent and therefore presumably were burnt\r\nalive, true martyrs to their belief. Of these there were two especially\r\nnotable--Maldonado whose case has been mentioned above, and Manuel\r\nBautista Pérez. The latter was the leader and chief among the\r\nPortuguese, who styled him the _capitan grande_. He was the greatest\r\nmerchant in Lima and his fortune was popularly estimated at half a\r\nmillion pesos. It was in his house that were held the secret meetings in\r\nwhich he joined in the learned theological discussions, but outwardly he\r\nwas a zealous Christian and had priests to educate his children; he was\r\ngreatly esteemed by the clergy who dedicated to him their literary\r\neffusions in terms of the warmest adulation. He owned rich silver mines\r\nin Huarochiri and two extensive plantations; his confiscated house has\r\nsince been known as the _casa de Pilatos_, and his ostentatious mode of\r\nlife may be judged by the fact that when his carriage was sold by the\r\ntribunal it fetched thirty-four hundred pesos. He had endeavored to\r\ncommit suicide by stabbing himself, but he never faltered at the end.\r\nHe listened proudly to his sentence and died impenitent, telling the\r\nexecutioner to do his duty. There was one other prisoner who did not\r\nappear. Enrique Jorje Tavares, a youth of 18, was among those arrested\r\nin August, 1635. He denied under torture and after various alternations\r\nbecame permanently insane, for which reason his case was suspended in\r\n1639.\r\n\r\nThe next day the mob of Lima enjoyed the further sensation of the\r\nscourging through the streets. These exhibitions always attracted a\r\nlarge crowd, in which there were many horsemen who thus had a better\r\nview, while boys commonly pelted the bigamists and sorceresses who were\r\nthe usual patients. On this occasion the tribunal issued a proclamation\r\nforbidding horses or carriages in the streets through which the\r\nprocession passed, and any pelting of the penitents under pain, for\r\nSpaniards, of banishment to Chile, and for Indians and negroes, of a\r\nhundred lashes. There were twenty-nine sufferers in all; they were\r\nmarched in squads of ten, guarded by soldiers and familiars, while the\r\nexecutioners plied the scourges, and the brutalizing spectacle passed\r\noff without disturbance, and with the pious wish of the tribunal that it\r\nwould please God to make it serve as a warning.[725]\r\n\r\nThe holocaust had been duly offered to a Savior of love and mercy; the\r\nmartyrs had sealed in flame and torment their adherence to the Ancient\r\nFaith, and the mob had had its spectacle. Satisfied with the results of\r\ntheir pious labors for the greater glory of God, the inquisitors calmly\r\nwent forward to gather in the gleanings from the ruined commerce and\r\nindustry of the kingdom, to retain what they could for themselves and to\r\naccount for as little as they might to their superiors. The process was\r\nlong and complex and it was years before all the tangled skeins were\r\nravelled out, and the clamorous creditors of the victims had their\r\nclaims satisfied or rejected.\r\n\r\nThere were still some remnants of the hated Portuguese to be dealt with.\r\nAfter the auto, seven cases, which had been pending for three years or\r\nmore, were suspended, followed, in 1639 and 1640, by others of\r\nreconciliation or suspension. In 1641 there was an auto, November 17th,\r\nin which three Judaizers were reconciled and seven others sentenced to\r\nconfiscation and a hundred lashes apiece. There still remained of the\r\n“complicidad grande” Manuel Henríquez, who had been arrested in\r\nDecember, 1635, and had confessed under torture, after which he revoked,\r\nand several extravagances led to his being thought crazy, but in 1647 he\r\nwas condemned to the stake. The tribunal however waited for other\r\nvictims to justify the expense of an auto and, in 1656, he was still\r\nlingering in prison; he was not burnt until 1664 in company with the\r\neffigy of Murcia de Luna, the victim of torture. The Inquisition, in\r\nfact, had passed its apogee and had become inert as its wealth\r\nincreased. In 1648 it reported that its only prisoner was Manuel\r\nHenríquez, who was awaiting the execution of his sentence.[726]\r\n\r\nThis was not because the Portuguese had been exterminated. They were\r\nstill numerous, although the revolt of Portugal, in 1640, had rendered\r\nthem, if not as yet foreigners, at least citizens whose loyalty might\r\nwell be suspect. Political as well as religious motives may therefore be\r\nascribed to the action of the Viceroy Pedro de Toledo, Marquis of\r\nMancera, at the instance of the Audiencia, under impulsion of the\r\ntribunal, when, in 1646, he issued an edict that all Portuguese should\r\npresent themselves with their arms and should leave the country. More\r\nthan six thousand are said to have come forward and by payment of a\r\nlarge sum to have obtained a revocation of the measure--a venal\r\ntransaction which formed the basis of one of the accusations brought\r\nagainst Mancera in the _residencia_ or customary investigation at the\r\nclose of his term of office.[727]\r\n\r\nEither the tribunal had become too indolent for active work, or the\r\nPortuguese population had been cowed into sincere acceptance of\r\nCatholicism, for we hear little subsequently of Judaism. It was not that\r\nsensitiveness to Jewish observances had decreased, for in 1666 Juan Leon\r\nCisneros was accused of buying scaleless fish on Fridays and of not\r\nsending his children to school on the Sabbath, for which suspicious\r\nactions he was sentenced to abjuration.[728] From that time there is a\r\nlong interval and even the ferocious recrudescence of persecution in\r\nSpain, during the first third of the eighteenth century, awoke but a\r\nfeeble echo in Peru.\r\n\r\nThe next two cases that present themselves are highly significant of\r\ninquisitorial methods. About 1720 Alvaro Rodríguez was prosecuted for\r\nJudaism but died in prison and his case was never concluded. Still his\r\nsequestrated property, amounting to fourteen thousand pesos, was\r\nremitted to the Suprema, although the Inquisition had no claim on it,\r\nfor he had left no relatives in Peru and Philip V had ordered the\r\nseizure of all Portuguese property as a measure of retaliation in the\r\nrelations between the two countries. The other case was that of Don\r\nTeodoro Candioti, a Levantine Christian, who had married in Lima. He was\r\narrested, probably somewhat before 1722, on suspicion of Judaism arising\r\nfrom his keeping the day before Christmas as a fast, according to the\r\ncustom of his country. He had also said that St. Moses was a great saint\r\nand as such was venerated in his land. There was some talk of his being\r\ncircumcised, but this was unfounded. He died in prison, May 19, 1726,\r\nmaking a most Christian end and saying that salvation was to be had by\r\nkeeping the law of God, through the grace of Jesus Christ. His body was\r\nthrust into one of the graves of the tribunal but the Suprema ordered,\r\nNovember 24, 1728, that his bones should be secretly transferred and\r\nburied with Christian rites in the parish church and that an entry be\r\nmade in the parish register of his burial as of the day of his death,\r\nwithout stating that he had died in prison, and further that a\r\ncertificate of no disability be given to his widow and children,\r\nincluding capacity to hold offices in the Inquisition. Evidently the\r\nfalsification of church records was a matter of course when the\r\ninjustice of the Inquisition was to be concealed. The tribunal itself\r\nhad still less scruple. It replied, August 26, 1729, that it had\r\nalready, on December 23, 1727, reported the translation of the remains\r\nto the church of the Dominican college of St. Thomas; another exhumation\r\nseemed unnecessary, but it had had the required entry made in the parish\r\nregister. The widow had presented the genealogies of her two sons, Don\r\nAntonio and Don Juan Candioti, asking that they be made familiars and,\r\nas the viceroy was much interested in the family, the request had been\r\ngranted.[729] This case brings before us one of the deplorable results\r\nof the system of secrecy; a husband and father disappears into the\r\nprison; he dies, and his family only learn his fate after seven years of\r\nsuspense.\r\n\r\nA more flagrant case was that of Doña Ana de Castro, a married woman of\r\ngood social position but of dubious character, as she was reported to\r\nhave sold her favors to one of the viceroys and to many of the rich\r\ncolonial nobles. Accused of Judaism, she persistently denied; when, in\r\n1731, her case was reported to the Suprema, she had been voted to\r\nrelaxation with preliminary torture, to which the Suprema replied,\r\nFebruary 4, 1732, that if the torture and efforts of the theologians did\r\nnot bring repentance, the sentence was to be executed, but, if she\r\nconfessed and gave signs of repentance, she was to be reconciled. She\r\nwas held until the solemn public auto of December 23, 1736, when she was\r\nrelaxed to the secular arm as a Judaizing Jew, convicted, negative and\r\npertinacious. On her way to the brasero she is said to have shed tears,\r\nbut the alguazil mayor paid no attention to them and she was duly\r\nburnt--probably without preliminary strangulation. All, apparently, was\r\nin accordance with routine procedure but, when the records came to be\r\ninvestigated in the visitation of Arenaza, Amusquíbar reported that the\r\nday before the auto she sought two audiences; no record was made of\r\nwhat occurred, but there could be no doubt that she confessed more than\r\nenough to entitle her to reconciliation; even if she did not entirely\r\nsatisfy the evidence, what more could be expected of a poor woman in\r\nsuch agitation of mind and ignorant of the trap laid for her by\r\nCalderon, who acted as fiscal? The printed official account of the auto\r\nrather superfluously recites how she was notified of her sentence at ten\r\no’clock of December 21st, after which two theologians, relieved every\r\nhour until 6 A.M. of December 23d, labored vainly to induce her to\r\nconfess and to return to the faith. Amusquíbar, on the contrary, states\r\nthat there was no record that she was notified of the sentence; that the\r\nbook of votes did not contain such a sentence and that, even if there\r\nwas one, it was invalid in consequence of the absence of the Ordinary;\r\nmoreover that, in spite of her confessions, no new consulta de fe was\r\nsummoned to consider them. Altogether, if Amusquíbar is to be believed,\r\nit was a cold-blooded judicial murder contrived, like the burning of\r\nUlloa in effigy, for the purpose of rendering more impressive the\r\nspectacle of the auto de fe. In the same auto there was a reconciliation\r\nin effigy of Pedro Núñez de la Haba, a Judaizer of Valdivia, who had\r\nescaped from prison after his case was finished. If recaptured he was to\r\nbe confined in the castle of Chagre, until he could be sent to the\r\npenitential prison of Seville, and was to have two hundred lashes for\r\nhis flight. A small _auto particular_ followed, November 11, 1737, in\r\nwhich Juan Antonio Pereyra, a Portuguese, was sentenced to abjure _de\r\nvehementi_, two hundred lashes, ten years of presidio at Valdivia and\r\nhalf confiscation.[730]\r\n\r\nThese are the only cases of Judaism recorded at this period and if the\r\nnumber is so scanty this must be attributed to the lack of Judaizers and\r\nnot to indifference of the tribunal. How ready it was to prosecute is\r\nexhibited in the next case, that of Don Juan de Loyola y Haro, a scion\r\nof the family of St. Ignatius and an elderly gentleman of high\r\nconsideration. He was arrested, July 9, 1743, on a charge of Judaism\r\nbased on the flimsiest testimony of a negro slave. Other evidence was\r\ngathered, but with it the commissioner of Ica wrote that the current\r\nbelief regarded it as a conspiracy on the part of his slaves, and that\r\nthis had been confessed by one of the witnesses when dying. In spite of\r\nthis his trial continued, nor was he released when, in February, 1745,\r\nthe four false witnesses were arrested. He fell sick; in July he was\r\ntransferred to a convent, where he died, December 27th of the same year,\r\nand was secretly buried in the chapel of S. María Magdalena. Evidently\r\nhis family were kept in ignorance until an auto was held October 19,\r\n1749, when the witnesses were punished and a great parade was made of\r\nthe equity of the tribunal. His effigy was carried in procession,\r\nbearing in one hand a palm-branch and in the other a gold baton\r\nsymbolical of his military rank as maestre de campo. His acquittal was\r\nread, empowering his brothers to carry the effigy around the town on a\r\nwhite horse, to exhume the remains and bury them where he had indicated\r\non his death-bed, and certificates were granted to them that his\r\nimprisonment inflicted no disabilities on his kindred. On the next day\r\nthe procession of the white horse took place with much pomp and\r\ncircumstance. The Suprema, on reviewing the report, pronounced the whole\r\nproceedings to be vicious from the start and destitute of all the\r\nsafeguards provided against injustice.[731] It is perhaps worth noting\r\nthat most of it occurred after Calderon and Unda had been superseded by\r\nArenaza and Amusquíbar. With this the formal persecution of Judaism in\r\nPeru comes to an end, except that, in 1774, the tribunal wrote to the\r\nSuprema that the only cases then pending were thirteen for Judaizing,\r\nbut that they had no basis.[732]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith regard to the general character of the punishments inflicted it may\r\nbe remarked that they vary capriciously, in accordance doubtless with\r\nthe temper of the inquisitors, whose discretion had few limits. In the\r\nearlier days there would seem to be a tendency to greater rigor than\r\nthat customary in Spain. In the auto of 1578 the sentences, as a rule,\r\nare exceedingly severe.[733] When Judaism came to be conspicuous, the\r\npenalties which we have seen inflicted were very similar to those\r\nimposed for the same offence by the home tribunals. As the galleys went\r\nout of fashion and were replaced by forced labor in the presidios, the\r\nprincipal destination to which culprits were sent was Valdivia, though\r\noccasionally they were assigned to Callao, Chagre or other ports where\r\nfortifications were under construction. Scourging, as in Spain, was a\r\nfavorite resort, without distinction of sex. We have seen how ruthlessly\r\nit was employed in the great auto of 1639 and this continued as long as\r\nthe tribunal was active. In the auto of 1736 there were sixteen\r\nsentences of two hundred lashes, half of them on women, for bigamy,\r\nsorcery and other similar offences. In that of 1737 there were only nine\r\npenitents, five of them being women; all of them were sentenced to two\r\nhundred lashes apiece, but this was remitted in the case of one of the\r\nmen.[734] In addition to the suffering, there was the severest of\r\nhumiliations for those sensitive to shame. The so-called penitents were\r\nmarched in procession through the streets, naked from the waist up, with\r\ninsignia or inscriptions denoting their offences, while the executioner\r\nplied the lash. The assembled mob was in the habit of manifesting its\r\npiety by stoning the poor wretches, to repress which the tribunal\r\noccasionally issued a proclamation, such as we have seen in 1639.\r\nSimilarly, before the auto of October 19, 1749, it forbade the throwing\r\nof stones, apples, oranges or other missiles at the penitents, under\r\npain of a hundred pesos for Spaniards and ten pesos with four days of\r\nprison for others.[735] Although there are frequent sentences to\r\nimprisonment for longer or shorter terms, there is no allusion anywhere\r\nto a _casa de la misericordia_ or _de la penitencia_, as it was called\r\nin Spain, in which the penitents could perform their penance.\r\nOccasional instances in which they are ordered to be shipped to the home\r\ncountry renders it probable that this was the usual recourse in such\r\ncases. Exile was a frequent penalty, sometimes to a designated place,\r\nbut more frequently from certain cities or districts, where the culprit\r\nhad committed offences; when this happened to be his native home, where\r\nhis trade or profession was established, it might be a most severe\r\ninfliction, depriving him of his means of livelihood; when the culprit\r\nwas a vagrant or an old sorceress it mattered little.\r\n\r\nThe inexplicable inconsistency in the adjudgement of penalties, when\r\ngauged by any rational standard, can best be understood by the contrast\r\nin a few cases. The tenderness displayed towards the abuse of the\r\nconfessional has already been alluded to. The same is seen in some of\r\nthe sentences for crimes of a still more serious character. Thus in the\r\nauto of July 12, 1733, Sebastiana de Figueroa, a mestiza aged 60, for\r\nsorceries including adoration of the demon and causing sickness and\r\ndeaths, offences for which in a secular tribunal she would have been\r\nexecuted without mercy, yet escaped with abjuration _de vehementi_, half\r\nconfiscation, two hundred lashes (which were remitted) and four years of\r\nexile to a designated place.[736] In the auto of 1736, María Josepha\r\nCanga, a free negress, who had made her husband insane with sorceries\r\nand herbs, so as to have freedom for adultery, merely abjured _de levi_,\r\nwith four years’ service in the hospital of San Bartolomé. In the same\r\nauto, Juan González de Ribera, a mestizo, had gone to the Indians,\r\nadopted their ways, professed their religion and, worst of all, had\r\ninduced several Spaniards to do the same, in addition to which he had\r\ntaken three wives. He was thus a dogmatizer and was condemned as a\r\nbigamist, idolater, sorcerer and diviner, and yet he merely abjured _de\r\nvehementi_ and had three years hard labor on an island off Callao.[737]\r\n\r\nWith this ill-judged mercy may be contrasted the case of François Moyen,\r\na Frenchman of varied talents and wide culture, skilled as an artist\r\nand musician, whose evil fortune threw him upon the tender mercies of\r\nAmusquíbar. Born in 1720, he led a somewhat adventurous life; that he\r\nwas a believing Catholic is seen in a vow of pilgrimage to Compostela,\r\nmade during danger in a voyage--a vow which he duly performed in 1739,\r\nduring a residence in Lisbon. In 1746 he sailed from there to Rio de\r\nJaneiro, with the Count de las Torres, who had important business in\r\nChile. At Buenos Ayres they parted, the count hastening across the\r\nPampas, while Moyen tarried there for awhile, his vivacity and his\r\naccomplishments rendering him a general favorite. During his stay he\r\nagain manifested his devoutness by performing the spiritual exercises of\r\nSt. Ignatius. About the middle of 1748, at the request of the count, who\r\nhad gone to Lima, he started to rejoin him by way of Potosí, in company\r\nof a band of traders. With light-hearted carelessness, he talked freely,\r\nin the confidence of the road and the bivouac; as a Frenchman of the\r\nGallican school and accustomed to the freedom of speech in Paris, he\r\nsaid much that he had better have left unsaid, with a singular\r\nimprudence in view of his acquaintance with the methods of the\r\nPortuguese Inquisition, his criticism of which formed one of the counts\r\nin his indictment.\r\n\r\nHe became an object of suspicion to his companions, especially to a\r\nGallego named José Antonio Soto. Potosí was reached March 27, 1749,\r\nwhere a considerable stay was made, during which Moyen expended four\r\npesos in masses. Two days after arrival, Soto denounced him to the\r\ncommissioner José de Ligaraza Beaumont y Navarra, who secretly summoned\r\nthe other travellers and muleteers, and gathered testimony swelling the\r\n_sumaria_ to some two hundred pages. It was loose and thoughtless talk\r\ncapable in the hands of the inquisitorial theologians of deductions most\r\ndamaging--predestination in its most absolute form, polygamy\r\njustifiable, marriage not a sacrament; masses, prayers and indulgences\r\nwere useless to souls in purgatory; limbo and purgatory were doubtful;\r\nthe pope was not the head of the Church and had no power to bind or to\r\nloose; councils were superior to popes; it was wrong to condemn people\r\nfor lack of knowledge of the son of a carpenter, and much more of the\r\nsame kind. The ingenuity of the calificadores, in fact, injected heresy\r\ninto the simplest remarks. When he reproved a muleteer for abusing a\r\nmule and said that it was a creature of God, this was held to prove that\r\nhe was a Manichean. One brilliant night, looking at the stars, he\r\nobserved that their multitude was superfluous, thus assuming that God\r\nhad erred in creation, which was heretical blasphemy, constituting him\r\nan heretical blasphemer. A criticism of the luxury of the clergy, with a\r\nreference to the poverty of the Apostles, showed him to be a\r\nWickliffite.\r\n\r\nCommissioner Ligaraza assembled a consulta, which voted for the arrest\r\nof so dangerous a heretic. It was executed May 14th and he was\r\nimprisoned in chains. At first he was kept _incomunicado_, but\r\nsubsequently visitors were admitted who provoked him to risky\r\ndiscussions and then gave evidence against him, in which, among other\r\nmatters, a debate on the Eucharist told heavily against him. He became\r\nan epileptic and suffered frightfully from his chains and the cold\r\nclimate. The commissioner had no funds for his maintenance; he\r\nendeavored to support himself by painting, but this was insufficient and\r\nhis only solace, his violin, was taken and sold, reducing him to such\r\ndespair that he attempted suicide. The commissioner was in no haste and\r\ndid not report the arrest until June 9th nor transmit the evidence until\r\nDecember. On May 9, 11 and 12, 1750, the tribunal extracted from it\r\nforty-four heretical propositions and ordered Moyen’s transfer to Lima.\r\n\r\nThis journey, which commenced July 12th, consumed two years. Moyen’s\r\nhealth had been wrecked in his confinement and his epileptic fits\r\nrecurred almost daily. Several times he nearly died; at Chuquito he\r\nreceived the viaticum. It was not until April, 1751, that Cuzco was\r\nreached, when he chanced to interest a lawyer named Tomas de Lecaros,\r\nwho entered security for him and carried him to Arequipa, in vain search\r\nfor improvement. There he met an English hatter named William--a good\r\nCatholic who attended mass daily--who counselled hypocrisy and silence\r\nabout religious matters in a land where there was an Inquisition. Moyen\r\nchanced to mention this in his examinations; the Englishman was arrested\r\nand ruined.\r\n\r\nOn the return to Cuzco; a halt was made at Urcos, eight leagues distant.\r\nAmusquíbar, on September 14, 1751, called for his appearance within two\r\nmonths; the commissioner of Cuzco sent his notary, when Moyen drew a\r\ndagger and attempted resistance but was overpowered. Some three months\r\nlater Fray Juan de San Miguel wrote to the tribunal that Moyen was\r\nhardened in his heresies and scattered them freely around Cuzco. That\r\nplace was left, January 29, 1752, fortunately prior to the reception of\r\nan order from Amusquíbar to forward him in chains. March 26th he was\r\ndelivered to the tribunal, broken and prematurely old with the\r\nsufferings of these three preliminary years of his trial.\r\n\r\nProceedings dragged on with the customary delays. The accusation,\r\npresented October 13th, represented him as a formal and pertinacious\r\nheretic and a follower of the sects of Luther, Calvin, Jansen, Quesnel,\r\nManichee and Mahomet, besides being strongly suspect of Judaism.\r\nDiscussion over these articles lasted until May 18, 1753, when he\r\nprofessed profound repentance for having discussed religious matters and\r\nbegged for mercy. During the prolonged delays which ensued his\r\nsufferings in the prison were severe--in themselves an excessive\r\npunishment for reckless speech. Besides his continual epileptic fits,\r\nhis feet were eaten up by chigoes; his chains chafed his ankles into\r\nsores, which threatened gangrene of one leg, and when, to avert this, on\r\nNovember 13th, the alcaide was directed to remove one of the shackles,\r\nthe other was left on. In spite of this he made several attempts to\r\nescape--once by endeavoring to set fire to the door of his cell with the\r\ncandle allowed to him at night, whereupon he was deprived of it. Again\r\nhe succeeded in reaching the house of the Count of las Torres, only to\r\nbe remanded, and on a third effort his plans were betrayed by a prisoner\r\nin an adjoining cell.\r\n\r\nTwo years were consumed in sending the evidence to Potosí for\r\nratification and awaiting its return, although at first it had been\r\nratified _ad perpetuam_. It was not received until April, 1755, and then\r\nits publication was delayed until September 3d. After this followed the\r\ncustomary examinations on the evidence, which were prolonged until March\r\n14, 1758--a delay largely caused by Moyen’s constant epileptic attacks.\r\nHis counsel did not present the defence until November 8, 1759, and then\r\nthe consulta de fe was not assembled until January 15, 1761. It\r\nconsidered the case until February 14th, when the definitive vote was\r\ntaken, under a protest that torture was not ordered in view of the\r\nweakened condition of the accused. The sentence finally was published in\r\nthe auto of the following April 5th. It condemned him to abjure _de\r\nvehementi_, to ten years’ forced labor in an African presidio (Oran,\r\nCeuta or Melilla), or in the penitential prison of Seville, as the\r\ninquisitor-general might prefer, and to two hundred lashes, which were\r\ncommuted to vergüenza in consideration of his infirmities. The\r\nhumiliating parade of the vergüenza through the streets of Lima was duly\r\nperformed the next day; on the 11th he was shipped in irons by the\r\ngalleon San Juan Bautista, reaching Cádiz in November; in December he\r\nwas sent to Seville to which the African presidio was commuted. No\r\nconsideration seems to have been given to the sufferings of the thirteen\r\nyears of imprisonment since his arrest, nor to the wreck of a joyous and\r\npromising life for a few inconsiderate utterances.\r\n\r\nAmusquíbar sought to justify the excessive delays of the trial by the\r\nquarrels in which he was involved, by his own sickness and that of the\r\naccused, but the Suprema did not accept these excuses and replied that\r\nthe ten years intervening between the receipt of the prisoner and the\r\nsentence was an excessive delay and grave omission of the tribunal.[738]\r\nThere was in all this no special malignity; it was simply the habitual\r\napplication of the system with callous indifference as to the results to\r\nthe accused.\r\n\r\nNot the least important function of the Inquisition was the censorship\r\nof the press. Although in Spain this was reserved to the Suprema, and\r\nthe tribunals could only refer to it books which they regarded as\r\nsuspect, distance rendered independent action necessary in the colonies.\r\nFrom an early period the Lima tribunal examined books and prohibited\r\nsuch as it saw fit. The importation of printed matter was also, as in\r\nSpain, subject to its supervision. The original instructions, borne by\r\nCerezuela, enjoined special watchfulness by the commissioners at the\r\nseaports, to prevent the introduction of all works that were on the\r\nIndex. To insure this, at first no books were admitted except through\r\nCallao, and the commissioner at Panamá was required to keep a close\r\nwatch on everything destined for that point. Nothing could be shipped\r\nfrom there without his licence, nor could any package be opened except\r\nin his presence. The same vigilance was exercised at Callao, and all\r\nbooks were sent to Fray Juan de Almaraz, Prior of San Agustin, for\r\nexamination. As the settlement and commerce of Buenos Ayres developed,\r\nsimilar precautions were observed there. There was always a haunting\r\ndread of the efforts attributed to the Protestants to smuggle heretic\r\nbooks into the land. In 1605 there was a scare of this kind, based on\r\nrumors that ships from Lisbon manned by Flemings were bringing such\r\nworks in casks purporting to contain wine or salt, and special orders\r\nwere issued to the commissioner to be doubly watchful.[739] As in Spain,\r\nthis system was a serious impediment to trade, and led not infrequently\r\nto collisions with the secular authorities. It required that all ships\r\non arrival should be visited by the commissioner before any passenger or\r\nmerchandise was landed, and that the latter, when brought on shore,\r\nshould be opened in his presence and be minutely inspected.\r\n\r\nEven so high an ecclesiastical dignitary as the Archbishop of Lima was\r\nnot exempt from the censorship of the tribunal. We have seen how\r\nAmusquíbar used this power for the humiliation of Archbishop Barroeta,\r\nnor was this the only instance. Juan de Almoguera, who was archbishop\r\nfrom 1674 to 1676, while yet Bishop of Arequipa, had been strongly\r\nimpressed with the dissolute lives of the priests among the Indians and,\r\nin 1671, he published in Madrid a series of Instructions, which the\r\ninquisitors held to be not only defamatory to the priests, but to\r\ncontain propositions adverse to the Holy See. The archbishop defended\r\nhimself by asserting that his doctrines were approved by the most\r\nlearned men of Peru, and that the facts which he cited were perfectly\r\ntrue, for which he appealed to the testimony of the inquisitors\r\nthemselves. They admitted this, but nevertheless they caused the edict\r\nof prohibition to be published everywhere.[740]\r\n\r\nThe reformatory legislation of Carlos III, from 1762 to 1768, limiting\r\nthe unrestricted control of the Inquisition over the prohibition of\r\nbooks, was long in reaching Peru. In 1773 Viceroy Amat y Yunient says\r\nthat although he had not yet received the cédula of 1768 officially\r\nthrough the Council of Indies, yet he defines its provisions as a guide.\r\nIt put in force the Constitution _Sollicita ac provida_ of Benedict XIV,\r\nentitling authors to be heard in defence of their books; it prevented\r\nthe prohibition of books _ad interim_ until a final decision was\r\nreached; where expurgations were ordered they were to be made known so\r\nthat owners could delete the objectionable passages, and all edicts were\r\nto be submitted to the viceroy before publication.[741] The demand for\r\nliterature must have been greater than would be anticipated, for, in\r\n1772, there was a discussion between the viceroy and the tribunal over\r\nthe proceedings in opening and examining 165 cases of books.[742]\r\n\r\nAt this period the censorship was exercised largely through the civil\r\nauthorities. February 28, 1787, the Viceroy Count de Croix reported to\r\nthe king the execution of his orders of 1785 in the suppression and\r\nburning of certain books, the seizure of all copies that could be traced\r\nto the possession of booksellers or of individuals, and the issue of an\r\nedict prohibiting the printing of anything without a licence, even the\r\nUniversity not being permitted to publish the eulogies and addresses\r\ncustomary on the arrival of a viceroy, or the Latin orations with which\r\nthe studies were annually opened. The Inquisition is only alluded to in\r\nconnection with the examination of importations, none being delivered\r\nfrom the custom-house without preliminary inspection by the commissioner\r\nof the tribunal, in connection with an appointee of the government.[743]\r\nAs in Spain, this censorship extended over morals as well as over\r\nreligion and politics. In 1796, Antonio Ortiz, the commissioner at\r\nBuenos Ayres, was much exercised over certain wall-papers received from\r\nBarcelona. Some of them had mythological figures, such as Hercules,\r\nVenus and the like, which he considered intolerable. There was another\r\none representing the globe adorned with flowers and presided over by\r\nCupid with a lighted torch, as though to burn it with his impure fires,\r\nall of which he was impelled to cut up into small pieces.[744] As we\r\nhave seen in Mexico, even ill-advised symbols of devotion were\r\nprohibited. When, at the suppression in 1813, the building of the\r\nInquisition was entered, Stevenson describes seeing there among the mass\r\nof prohibited books, a quantity of cotton handkerchiefs on which was\r\nprinted a figure of Religion with a chalice in one hand and a cross in\r\nthe other--a device which the manufacturer had fondly believed would\r\nrender them popular, without reflecting upon the desecration inseparable\r\nfrom their use.[745]\r\n\r\nFrom this time the principal work of the tribunal was in the enforcement\r\nof the prohibition of literature regarded as dangerous to State or\r\nChurch. Camilo Henríquez, priest of the Padres Crucíferos de la Buena\r\nMuerte, was a prominent object of persecution. In 1809 he was denounced\r\nfor reading prohibited books; his cell was searched without success, but\r\nthe accuser insisted and on a more minute investigation his mattress was\r\nfound to be stuffed with the dangerous material. He was arrested and, in\r\n1810, was banished to Quito, but instead of obeying he joined the\r\ninsurgents of Chile and distinguished himself by supporting the\r\nrevolution in _La Aurora_, the periodical which he founded. Under the\r\nRestoration, the tribunal had little real work to do except to issue\r\nedicts prohibiting European periodicals, political pamphlets and other\r\nproductions in which it could discover opinions inimical to the\r\nestablished order in politics and religion.[746]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the turbulent atmosphere of the early nineteenth century, the\r\nauthority of the Inquisition naturally declined, especially as the\r\ncharacter of the inquisitors was so unfitted to inspire respect. Its\r\nsuppression by the decree of the Córtes of Cádiz, February 22, 1813, was\r\nevidently seen in advance to be inevitable and was fatal to its\r\ninfluence. Shortly before that decree was received Stevenson relates\r\nthat he was summoned before the tribunal, in consequence of a discussion\r\nin a coffee-house with a Fray Bustamante, respecting the image of the\r\nMadonna of the Rosary. If we may believe his story of the audience, he\r\ntreated the inquisitors with slender reverence and escaped with an\r\nadmonition to avoid religious disputes, and to bear in mind that in the\r\ndominions of his Catholic Majesty all men were subject to the\r\nInquisition.[747] When the decree of suppression was published, he had\r\nan opportunity of accompanying the first party that entered the\r\nbuilding, so long an object of universal dread. The prison cells were\r\nall open and empty; he describes them as small but not uncomfortable. In\r\nthe audience-chamber, back of the judges’ dais, there hung on high a\r\nlife-sized image of Christ; its head was so arranged as to be movable by\r\na person secreted behind, on a signal from the inquisitor, producing a\r\nprofound impression on the awestruck culprit, who was denying his guilt.\r\nFrom his description of the torture-room it would seem that the tortures\r\nemployed, though cruel enough, were less severe than those formerly in\r\nuse--the _cordeles_ and _jarras de agua_, the _mancuerda_, the\r\n_trampazo_ and the _garrucha_. There was a rack on which the arms and\r\nlegs could be stretched; a kind of pillory for scourging with scourges,\r\nsome of which were of wire chains with sharp points; “tormentors” of\r\nnetted wire with points, arranged to fit the wrists or waists, the legs\r\nor arms, and thumb-screws--a grisly collection, but less likely to\r\nendanger life and limb than the older atrocities. The crowd which found\r\nadmittance carried off some of these as mementos and also some of the\r\nrecords, but the archbishop the next day published an excommunication\r\nagainst all who should not return what they had taken, and most of the\r\ndocuments were restored.[748]\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the money found in the chest was taken by the\r\nauthorities and this of course was retained, but the salaries of the\r\nofficials were continued. The suspension was short-lived, ending with\r\nthe decree of July 21, 1814, re-establishing the Inquisition, when the\r\nthree inquisitors, Abarca, Zalduegui and Sobrino, resumed their places,\r\nbut the old awful authority could not be revived. They complained\r\nbitterly of the viceroy, who showed himself, they said, hostile to the\r\nre-establishment. He delayed issuing the decree, treated them with\r\ndiscourtesy and refused to refund the money. They depicted the\r\ndeplorable condition of the tribunal, destitute of means to pay salaries\r\nin arrears, or even to make arrests that had been resolved upon prior to\r\nthe suppression, while the buildings were dirty and out of repair.[749]\r\nWe can readily imagine that the progress of the War of Independence left\r\nlittle leisure or disposition on the part of the authorities to listen\r\nto their complaints. How completely decadent was their authority, is\r\nseen in a letter from the Suprema ordering them to summon an Englishman\r\nnamed John Robinson and point out to him that he had been admitted to\r\nresidence on condition of not talking about religion, or dogmatizing\r\nagainst Catholicism, and they were moreover to seek an interview with\r\nthe viceroy, to ask his aid in restraining the man and to report the\r\nresult.[750] Times had changed since François Moyen was so inhumanly\r\npersecuted for his loquacity.\r\n\r\nStill, they were not without some remnants of authority. The University\r\nof Lima had sent an address to the Córtes of Cádiz, congratulating it on\r\nthe decree of suppression. This was an offence not to be overlooked and,\r\nApril 7, 1815, the Suprema sent an order to dismiss all the signers of\r\nthe paper who held office under the tribunal. Accordingly, on October\r\n29th, Fray Josef Recalde was summoned to surrender his vestment and\r\nbadge as a calificador. To this he replied, November 3d, with a\r\nsupplication not to expose him to such a dishonor; the paper had been\r\npresented to him for signature by the beadle of the University, saying\r\nthat it was an act of obedience to the Córtes and he, being busy, had\r\nsigned it without reading it, as he was accustomed to do with the\r\nnumerous papers requiring his signature. On this Inquisitor-fiscal\r\nSobrino reported that Recalde only intensified his offence, and he\r\nproceeded to accuse the University of misleading youth and allowing them\r\nto read prohibited books, while Recalde’s statement only showed how\r\nrecklessly its members joined in anything resolved upon by the leaders.\r\nBoth papers were forwarded, December 13th, to the Suprema for its\r\njudgement, but whether Recalde was reinstated does not appear from the\r\ndocuments at hand.[751]\r\n\r\nThe officials continued to draw their salaries, but there is little\r\ntrace of their activity. The latest indication I have met of their\r\nperformance of duty is a letter from the Suprema, July 11, 1817, to the\r\ntribunal of Logroño, asking for information to guide the tribunal of\r\nLima in a case of alleged bigamy on the part of Don Fernando Díaz, then\r\na resident of Cuzco.[752] In that same year a “voluntary” subscription\r\nin aid of the government was organized, to which the contribution of\r\nInquisitor-fiscal Sobrino was niggardly, leading to his being\r\nreprimanded from Madrid.[753] In 1819 the tribunal was reorganized. The\r\nsenior inquisitor Abarca was dead and Zalduegui was dean; he and Sobrino\r\nwere jubilated on one-quarter of their salaries and the tribunal\r\nconsisted of Cristóval de Ortegon as senior, Anselmo Pérez de la Canal\r\nas junior and José Mariano de Larrea as fiscal.\r\n\r\nTheir term of office was short. The final decree of suppression, March\r\n9, 1820, was long in reaching Peru, where it was not promulgated until\r\nSeptember 9th, with orders to communicate it to all the archbishops of\r\nthe district and to take the necessary steps for assuming possession of\r\nthe property. This was done decently and in order. On September 18th\r\nViceroy Pezuela ordered the intendant of the province, in concert with\r\nthe two regidores of Lima, to proceed in accordance with the decree of\r\nFebruary 22, 1813, to occupy the property, including its patronage and\r\npious foundations, and to make an exact inventory. This was followed,\r\nSeptember 20th, with instructions that at 8.30 A.M. of Friday, September\r\n22d, possession should be taken, and the ex-dean was notified to be\r\nready in order that it should be executed with promptitude. At nine\r\no’clock on Saturday the intendant and the regidores met in the\r\nInquisition and made an inventory of all property found there. In\r\npursuance of Article 10 of the decree of 1813, the commission of three,\r\non September 28th, issued an order calling on the ex-receiver-general,\r\nCarlos Lizon, for an authentic list of all the officials with their\r\nsalaries, so that the latter might be paid. This was superfluous; from\r\ntime immemorial the custom had been to pay all salaries in advance, in\r\ninstalments of four months. The inquisitors had providently taken care\r\nof themselves and their subordinates and, on August 29th and September\r\n1st, had issued orders on Receiver Lizon for the _tercio adelantado_,\r\ncommencing September 1st, so that he was able to exhibit the\r\ncorresponding receipts, amounting to 9472 pesos and a fraction,\r\nindicating on annual pay-roll of 28,417 pesos.\r\n\r\nThat the inventory only showed a few items of volumes of records is\r\ntestimony of the completeness with which everything had been\r\nappropriated. Although the work of the tribunal had shrunk almost to\r\nnothingness, all the offices had been kept filled and the roster was as\r\ncomplete as it had been in the period of the greatest activity.[754] It\r\nis presumable that, as in Mexico, they went to Spain and were provided\r\nfor there.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe total amount of work accomplished is estimated by Medina as three\r\nthousand cases tried, but this is probably too liberal an allowance. His\r\nexhaustive researches have resulted only in an enumeration of 1474\r\ncases.\r\n\r\nThese consist of--\r\n\r\nLaymen            1126\r\nWomen              180\r\nSecular clergy     101\r\nFranciscans         49\r\nDominicans          34\r\nMercenarians        36\r\nAugustinians        26\r\nJesuits             12\r\n\r\nThe offences prosecuted were\r\n\r\nPropositions                       140\r\nJudaism                            243\r\nMoors                                5\r\nProtestants                         65\r\nSolicitation                       109\r\nBlasphemy                           97\r\nSexual errors                       40\r\nBigamy                             297\r\nSorcery                            172\r\nMiscellaneous and not specified    306\r\n\r\nFor the 250 years of existence, the estimate of a total of 3000 cases\r\nwould make 12 per annum, or 1 per month, but in the first 20 years of\r\nthe tribunal the cases amounted to 1265, which would reduce the average\r\nof the other 230 years to about 7-1/2, and it would be safe to assume\r\nfor the last century an average of not more than 3 or 4 a year.[755]\r\n\r\nFor this slender result, to say nothing of the large expenditure, the\r\ncolony was kept in a constant state of disquiet, the orderly course of\r\ngovernment was well-nigh impossible, intellectual, commercial and\r\nindustrial development were impeded, universal distrust of one’s\r\nneighbor was commanded by ordinary prudence, and the population lived\r\nwith the sense of evil ever impending over the head of every one. That\r\nthere was any real danger to the faith in Peru is absurd. Possibly the\r\ntribunal may have been of some service in repressing the prevalence of\r\nbigamy among laymen and of solicitation among the clergy, but the fact\r\nthat these two offences remained to the last so prominent in its\r\ncalendar would show that it accomplished little. As regards sorcery and\r\nsuperstitions, which pervaded all classes, in the mixed population of\r\nEuropeans, Indians, negroes and half-breeds, with an accumulation of\r\nsuperstitious beliefs drawn from so many sources, the number of cases is\r\nsurprisingly small, especially as the exemption of Indians from\r\ninquisitorial jurisdiction seems to have been disregarded in this\r\noffence. In the repression of the practices which were regarded as\r\nimplying pact with the demon the Inquisition may be said to have\r\nvirtually accomplished nothing. It would be difficult to find, in the\r\nannals of human misgovernment, a parallel case in which so little was\r\naccomplished at so great a cost as by the Inquisition under Spanish\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nNEW GRANADA.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the _Nuevo Reino de Granada_ originally formed part of the\r\nViceroyalty of Peru, it was the earliest settlement on the continent of\r\nSouth America. When Balboa, in 1514, reported his rich discoveries in\r\nDarien, no time was lost in sending out Pedro Arias Dávila as governor,\r\nwho landed at Santa Marta. He took with him as bishop Fray Juan de\r\nQuevedo, who formed one of his council with a right to vote, thus\r\nfounding at the start that curious complication of jurisdictions which\r\nexercised so unhappy an influence on the development of the Spanish\r\ncolonies. The see of Santa Marta, however, was not founded until 1531\r\nand, as settlements were pushed into the interior, Santa Fe de Bogotá\r\nwas established as the capital, where the Audiencia, or high court, was\r\norganized in 1547 and governed the colony until 1564, when Andrés Díaz\r\nVenero de Leiva was sent out as president.[756] It was not erected into\r\na viceroyalty until 1719, from which it was reduced to its former state\r\nin a few years, to be restored again in 1740.[757]\r\n\r\nIn 1532 the see of Cartagena was founded and, in 1547, that of Popayan.\r\nIn 1553 came the Franciscan Fray Juan Barrios with a bull of Julius III\r\nby which the see of Santa Marta was transferred to Santa Fe and erected\r\ninto an archbishopric, thus sundering it from the metropolis of Lima.\r\nSanta Marta was reduced to an abbacy, to be subsequently re-erected.\r\nCartagena was dismembered from Santo Domingo and the archiepiscopal\r\nprovince included it with Popayan and Santa Marta. In the absence of the\r\nInquisition, Archbishop Barrios exercised its functions and, in a series\r\nof Synodal Constitutions, issued in 1556, he ordered that no books\r\nshould be possessed or sold without being first examined by the bishop\r\nor his deputies, under the penalty of fifty pesos.[758]\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1570, the tribunal of Lima was established, its authority\r\nextended over all the Spanish possessions from Panamá to the south. The\r\norganization of so extended a territory was a work of time and the\r\nmaterial at hand for it was of the worst description, as we have seen in\r\nthe preceding chapter. It was not until 1577 that Inquisitor Cerezuela\r\nappointed a commissioner for Santa Fe, when his choice fell upon D. Lope\r\nClavijo, dean of the metropolitan chapter. In the exercise of his new\r\nauthority, Clavijo naturally became involved in bitter quarrels with the\r\narchbishop, Luis Zapata de Cardenas. His character reflected no credit\r\non the Holy Office, if it be true as reported that his official\r\napartments became a receptacle for women, on some of whom he committed\r\nviolence, and that the nuns of Tunja were obliged to forbid his entrance\r\ninto their parlor, in order to escape his licentious conversation. The\r\nCommissioner of Popayan, Gonzalo de Torres, was no better and was the\r\nsource of infinite trouble to the bishop, until the visitador, Juan Ruiz\r\nde Prado, summoned him to trial in Lima, on a prosecution containing\r\ntwenty charges. He seems, in 1589, to have been deprived of his office,\r\nwhich, as Archbishop Lobo Guerrero said to the Suprema, he used only as\r\na means of committing offences against God. We hear also of Juan García,\r\nCommissioner of Cumaná, appointed by Inquisitor Ulloa, as a reward for\r\ncommitting perjury against an enemy of the latter. His adulteries and\r\nincests with maids, wives and widows, mothers, daughters and sisters,\r\nwere notorious and he had caused the death of more than a hundred Indian\r\nlaborers without baptism or confession. Like the others, he only sought\r\nthe place for the protection afforded from punishment for his\r\ncrimes.[759]\r\n\r\nUnder worthies such as these, it is easy to understand that little\r\nattention was paid to the purification of the faith among the colonists.\r\nThe cases sent to Lima for trial were few and unimportant. There were no\r\nProtestants among them; the only accusation of Judaism was that of Juan\r\nde Herrera, in 1592, of which he was absolved in 1595, after undergoing\r\ntorture; the rest were the ordinary run of inquisitorial\r\nbusiness--sorcery, bigamy, blasphemy and propositions, more or less\r\ninnocent. That the commissioners, however, did not neglect opportunities\r\nthat presented themselves may be assumed from the case of Juan\r\nFernández, a merchant who, in 1588, denounced himself to the\r\nCommissioner of Cartagena because, on hearing that a man had hanged\r\nhimself he had exclaimed “May God forgive him!” This proposition was\r\ndecided to be heretical; Fernández was arrested, with sequestration of\r\nproperty, and was sentenced to abjure _de levi_, to hear mass as a\r\npenitent, and to pay a fine of a hundred pesos.[760]\r\n\r\nIt was evident that, if the faith was to be properly guarded, some\r\nauthoritative tribunal nearer than Lima or Mexico was necessary for the\r\nvast territory which included the whole sweep of the Antilles and the\r\ncoast of Tierra Firme from Panamá to Guiana. As early as April 8, 1580,\r\nInquisitor Cerezuela wrote that the people of New Granada were asking\r\nfor one, in view of their distance from Lima; this was great--fully six\r\nhundred leagues--and there would be no inconvenience in such a step\r\nexcept that he has understood that there were no suitable persons there\r\nto serve as consultors and calificadores.[761] Again, in 1600,\r\nInquisitor Ordóñez y Flores represented to the Suprema the enormous\r\nextent of the territory assigned to the Lima tribunal and suggested two\r\nnew ones--one at La Plata and the other at Santa Fe. The latter should\r\ninclude the sees of Popayan, Cartagena, Santa Marta and Venezuela,\r\nmaking a district four hundred leagues in length, in which it was\r\nimpossible to provide commissioners; at present there was but one, with\r\nwhom communication was so difficult that sometimes two years passed\r\nwithout hearing from him. A year earlier, in 1599, Archbishop Lobo\r\nGuerrero had written to the king to the same effect. He described the\r\nland as the most vicious and sinful in the Spanish dominions, and the\r\nfaith as on the point of destruction; the distance to Lima was so great\r\nthat offenders either died or escaped on the road and there was no money\r\nto meet the cost of sending them.[762]\r\n\r\nThe same cry went up from the islands. In 1594 the Council of Indies\r\nsuggested to the king that, in view of the failure of all efforts to\r\nsuppress the dealings of the people of Santo Domingo with the English\r\nand French corsairs, and with pirates of all nations, the\r\ninquisitor-general should commission the Archbishop of Santo Domingo as\r\nan inquisitor. On this being submitted to the Suprema it replied that\r\nthere were disadvantages in the plan and the true remedy would be to\r\nestablish a tribunal on the island, which could be done on the most\r\neconomical basis. Philip II ordered a junta of a member of each council\r\nto consider a grant of inquisitorial power to the archbishop for a term\r\nof three or four years.[763] Nothing was done. The king shrank from the\r\nexpense of a new tribunal and the Suprema was too jealous of the\r\nepiscopate to delegate its power to the archbishop. A similar fate\r\nawaited a complaint of Bishop Martin of Puerto Rico, in 1606, as to the\r\ninflux of heretic traders and sailors with their books, to remedy which\r\nhe urged that a tribunal be established in Santo Domingo, or that\r\ndelegated power be granted to the bishops, including authority to\r\nappoint alguaziles and familiars with the recognized privileges and\r\nexemptions.[764]\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that many representations of the same import\r\npoured in upon the court and finally, in 1608, the Council of Indies\r\nformally urged the erection of a tribunal in Santo Domingo. After due\r\ndiscussion, it was resolved to include in the district all the lands\r\nsurrounding the Caribbean, except Central America, and, as its\r\ninquisitors subsequently boasted, it enjoyed the most extensive\r\nterritories of any tribunal, embracing the archbishoprics of both Santa\r\nFe and Santo Domingo and the bishoprics of Cartagena, Panamá, Santa\r\nMarta, Popayan, Venezuela, Puerto Rico and Santiago de Cuba.[765] Its\r\nseat was fixed at Cartagena, as a central point and leading port of\r\nentry, which had had time to recover from its devastation by Drake in\r\n1585. Its position and its safe and capacious harbor, easily defensible\r\nby fortifications, rendered it the entrepôt of the trade with the\r\nPacific, and the place where the treasures of the colonies were gathered\r\nfor transhipment to Spain, while the pearl fishery of Margarita and the\r\nproductions of a province rich in mineral and agricultural wealth gave\r\nit a large and lucrative commerce. As the seat of a tribunal it had the\r\nadvantage that, unlike Lima and Mexico, it was not a capital where the\r\nhumors of inquisitors could be in some slight degree controlled by a\r\nviceroy and a royal Audiencia. They had only to deal directly with a\r\nlocal governor and municipal authorities on the one side, and with a\r\nsimple bishop on the other; there was little to restrain them, short of\r\nthe Suprema beyond the Atlantic, and we shall see that they took full\r\nadvantage of their position in the endless embroilments which formed\r\ntheir chief occupation. The history of the tribunal is to be found not\r\nso much in its autos de fe as in the guerrilla war which for a century\r\nit maintained with the authorities, civil and ecclesiastical, rendering\r\ndecent and orderly government impossible and going far to explain the\r\ndecadence and decrepitude of the colony.\r\n\r\nExtensive as was the district of the tribunal, it sought to extend its\r\nauthority still farther over Florida. As early as 1606 there is a\r\ncurious letter from Fray Juan Cabezas, Bishop of Cuba, reciting that the\r\ntribunal of Mexico had appointed Fray Francisco Carranco as commissioner\r\nin Havana--under what authority does not appear. On the news of his\r\ncoming the good bishop fled from Havana and took refuge in St.\r\nAugustine, whence he despatched his provisor to Spain to protest against\r\nthe announced intentions of Carranco to include Florida within his\r\njurisdiction. This had caused lively anxiety among the garrison, some\r\nthree hundred in number, who with the friars were the only Spaniards\r\nthere. The Indians as yet were so little rooted in the faith that\r\nrecently in the missions they had slain four or five of the\r\nmissionaries. There were, he adds, many women and children, for most of\r\nthe soldiers were married and the effort was made to induce all to\r\nmarry, for the hardships of the place were such that, without these\r\nties, the governor would not venture to send any one away with the\r\nexpectation of his return.[766] In 1621 there was some discussion as to\r\nsending a commissioner there, but nothing was done. Then, in 1630,\r\nInquisitor Agustin Ugarte y Saravia reported from Cartagena that he had\r\nsent to the Governor of St. Augustine, Luis de Rojas y Borja,\r\ncommissions in blank for a commissioner and familiar, fearing that, if\r\nappointees were sent, he would not receive them, as the settlement was\r\nwholly military, even the Franciscan missionaries being rated as\r\nsoldiers.[767] It is not likely that the governor filled out the\r\ncommissions, for Florida remained deprived of the blessing of the Holy\r\nOffice. In 1692 another attempt was made. The Cartagena tribunal\r\nappointed Fray Pedro de Lima as commissioner with power to nominate\r\nsubordinates, without requiring proofs of limpieza. Of this he availed\r\nhimself to create a notary, an alguazil mayor and four familiars, thus\r\nestablishing a tribunal of his own. The governor, Don Diego de Quiroga y\r\nLanada, took the alarm and wrote earnestly to the Council of Indies. All\r\nthis, he said, was simply to escape the royal jurisdiction; Fray Pedro,\r\nas a friar, was ineligible to the post of commissioner; the tribunal of\r\nCartagena had no jurisdiction over Florida, where, by the Concordias,\r\nthere was to be no Inquisition and, if cases of faith arose, they were\r\nto be treated by the cura or the ecclesiastical Vicariate. The Council\r\nof Indies, December 9, 1695, reported this to the king, asking that the\r\nSuprema be told to order the Cartagena tribunal to desist; to this\r\nCarlos II assented and the attempt to establish an Inquisition in\r\nFlorida seems to have ended here.[768]\r\n\r\nOn June 29, 1610, Mateo de Salcedo and Juan de Mañozca--the latter a\r\nname of evil import to the Spanish colonies--the newly appointed\r\ninquisitors for Cartagena, set sail from Cádiz, with a fiscal, alguazil,\r\nnotary and messenger, and power to appoint all necessary subordinates,\r\nwhose commissions would be issued by the Suprema. On August 9th they\r\narrived at Santo Domingo, where they were received with all honor and\r\npublished the Edict of Faith; they received some self-denunciations,\r\nthey appointed the Dominican Provincial as temporary commissioner, and\r\nthe archbishop surrendered the papers of all cases heard by him and his\r\npredecessors. Sailing on September 4th, they reached Cartagena on the\r\n21st, where their reception by the civil and ecclesiastical authorities\r\nwas conducted with great pomp. On the 26th the royal letters were read\r\nand the oaths of obedience taken; three houses were rented for their\r\noccupation until a suitable building could be rented. The king allowed\r\nthem 8000 pesos for their installation, with which they bought the\r\nhouses in which they were lodged, paying half in cash and, with the\r\nremainder of the money, building a prison with thirteen cells.[769] For\r\nthe support of the officials, as in the case of Mexico and Lima, the\r\nking provided a subvention of 8400 ducats a year, until the fines and\r\nconfiscations should suffice to defray expenses; but, profiting by\r\nexperience, he endeavored to guard against the habitual deceit of the\r\ntribunals. In his cédula of March 8, 1610, to the treasury officials of\r\nCartagena, he ordered that sum to be paid out of any funds in the\r\ntreasury or, if those were not sufficient, then out of what came in from\r\nthe province, but, in order to know how much of this subvention should\r\nbe paid, the receiver of the tribunal was required to furnish every year\r\na statement of the confiscations and of all moneys applicable to the\r\nsalaries, which were to be duly deducted from the treasury\r\npayments.[770] We shall see, as in Mexico and Peru, how fruitless was\r\nthe precaution against audacious inquisitorial mendacity.\r\n\r\nThe tribunal found little to do in justification of its existence. It\r\nwas not until February 2, 1614, that it held its first auto de fe, in\r\nwhich it presented about thirty penitents, whose offences consisted of\r\ntrivial propositions, blasphemies, superstitious arts and the like.\r\nNevertheless the ceremonies were conducted with all solemnity to impress\r\nthe population, and a long and grandiloquent report was sent to the\r\nSuprema. Four readers of the sentences were employed, so that the\r\nreading could be continuous, yet such was the verbosity that the\r\nceremonies lasted from half-past nine in the morning until after sunset\r\nand the auto had to be finished by torch-light. There were about a dozen\r\nsentences of scourging through the streets and when, on the next\r\nafternoon, the infliction was to commence, a motley crowd of negroes,\r\nmestizos, mulattos and Spaniards, estimated at four thousand, assembled,\r\narmed with oranges and other fruits wherewith to pelt the victims. The\r\nescort provided for them was afraid to venture forth until the\r\ninquisitors made proclamation threatening a hundred lashes for any such\r\nmanifestation of pious zeal, when every one dropped his missile and the\r\npunishment was carried out in peace.[771]\r\n\r\nBesides these there had been despatched in the audience-chamber sixteen\r\ncases, one of which is worth mentioning as an example of the spirit in\r\nwhich the inquisitors commenced their duties. For some matter of slight\r\nimportance, Doña Lorenza de Acereto, a noble married woman, had been\r\npenanced by the episcopal provisor Almanso, prior to the founding of the\r\ntribunal. Probably stimulated by the Edict of Faith she was impelled to\r\ndenounce herself to it and Mañozca, who had some private grudge to\r\nsatisfy, imprisoned her for eight months and then sentenced her to a\r\nfine of 4000 ducats and exile for two years. When the sentence was read,\r\nshe appealed to the inquisitor-general but, as she was leaving the room,\r\nshe was warned that she would be immured for life in the secret prison\r\nand, in dread of this, she withdrew the appeal. It chanced that Almanso\r\nwas soon afterwards sent to Madrid by his bishop to complain of the\r\ntribunal; he represented this matter to the Suprema, which sent for the\r\npapers of the trial and, on examining them, suspended the case as\r\ngroundless.[772]\r\n\r\nIt was in unimportant routine work of this kind that the inquisitors\r\nemployed the intervals of their quarrels with the civil and\r\necclesiastical authorities. Cartagena numbered a population of only five\r\nhundred Spaniards; the rest were negro slaves, Indians and the\r\nhalf-castes so numerous in the Spanish colonies. The Indians were not\r\nsubject to inquisitorial jurisdiction and among the whites there was not\r\nintellectual energy sufficient to produce serious heresy. Mañozca, in\r\nfact, in a letter of March 17, 1622, to the Suprema describes them as\r\nwholly devoted to the pursuit of gain and utterly regardless of honor\r\nand reputation, from the Governor down. There is no one, he says, who\r\nwill trouble himself with useful works, and virtue and honor are\r\ncontraband, for they are only prized where there are virtuous and\r\nhonorable men.[773] There were left the negroes and mixed races,\r\nignorant and superstitious. The slaves had brought from the Guinea coast\r\nthe mysteries of Obeah and dark practices of sorcery. The native Indians\r\nhad ample store of superstitions, to cure or to injure, to provoke love\r\nor hatred; the colonists had their own credulous beliefs, to which they\r\nadded implicit faith in those of the inferior races. The land was\r\noverrun with this combination of the occult arts of three continents,\r\nall of which were regarded by the Inquisition, not as idle fancies, but\r\nas the exercise of supernatural powers, involving express or implicit\r\npact with the demon. Had the tribunal seriously labored to eradicate\r\nthem, it would have had ample work for its energies, but the offenders\r\nwere slaves or paupers; there was neither honor nor profit in their\r\nprosecution, and consequently no energy. Indeed Mañozca, in the letter\r\njust quoted, endeavored to be released from the task--perhaps the only\r\ninstance on record of an inquisitor desiring to abandon a portion of\r\nthe jurisdiction for which the Holy Office was wont to struggle so\r\ndesperately.\r\n\r\nHe gives a fearful account of the witchcraft practised by the negro\r\nslaves in the mines of Saragossa, in Antioquia, who kill, cripple and\r\nmaim men and women and suffocate children and destroy the fruits of the\r\nearth. There are about four thousand of them, brought from Guinea, who,\r\nthough baptized, are wholly untaught in the faith, and are more like\r\nbrutes than men. The missionaries among them pay no heed to their\r\ninstruction but are wholly absorbed in the search for gold. The district\r\nis remote and mountainous and only to be reached by footpaths; the\r\nsmallest coin there is gold and to arrest a culprit costs more than his\r\nvalue as a slave. The tribunal has no funds to bring them hither for\r\ntrial and their maintenance in gaol is a heavy burden on the owners.\r\nFour have been tried and condemned to reconciliation and perpetual\r\nprison, but the Inquisition has no penitential prison and, if there was\r\none, they would starve to death, as they could not earn their support\r\nand the alms of the pious would not reach so miserable a set of beings.\r\nThey have therefore been put into the Hospital General, where they can\r\nbe employed and hear mass and perform their penance. As for the great\r\nmass of the culprits, it would be impossible for the tribunal to arrest\r\nand try them--the cost would be enormous and the result, according to\r\nlaw, would be to set them free, which would fill the land with demons,\r\nnor would the owners permit their capture, in the certainty of losing\r\nthem. To meet these difficulties Mañozca therefore suggests a general\r\npardon, after which the civil authorities shall have cognizance of their\r\ncrimes and punish them otherwise than with the benignity habitual with\r\nthe Inquisition. The Suprema was hardly prepared thus to surrender even\r\nso unprofitable a portion of its jurisdiction and, in forwarding this\r\nletter to the king, urged that an Edict of Grace should be proclaimed;\r\nthat he should assist the tribunal with the funds necessary for the\r\nsupport of the officials and the expense of its functions, and that the\r\nCouncil of Indies should order the royal officials to inflict severe\r\npunishment, in so far as they had jurisdiction, and should assist the\r\nInquisition in making arrests and other acts. To this Philip IV drily\r\nreplied that the Council of Indies would order the governors to apply\r\nsuch remedies as they deemed advisable.[774] All parties thus sought to\r\nwash their hands of this troublesome and costly affair, and witchcraft\r\nand sorcery continued to flourish.\r\n\r\nThey were not confined to the slaves in the mines of Antioquia and, some\r\nten years later, there was an outburst which offered fairer inducements\r\nto repay prosecution. A great assembly of witches was discovered among\r\nthe negroes of the town of Tolú--an accessible sea-port, about\r\nsixty-five miles from Cartagena--where the witnesses testified to all\r\nthe classical features of the Sabbat--flying through the air, dancing\r\naround a goat, kissing him _retro_ and all the customary performances.\r\nSince the great auto de fe of witches at Logroño in 1610, the Suprema\r\nhad grown skeptical and cautious as to these superstitions, and had\r\nimpressed on the tribunals the necessity of acting with great reserve in\r\nall such cases. In reporting this matter therefore, September 25, 1632,\r\nthe inquisitors said that they had observed these instructions and had\r\narrested only a mulatto woman and a mestiza, who had persistently denied\r\nthe charges. Still the testimony continued to pour in, spreading the\r\nepidemic to Cartagena and implicating Spaniards of consideration and\r\nproperty, for witnesses who confessed to having been at the Sabbat were\r\nfree to designate whomsoever they chose as having been present--a fact\r\nwhich explains the rapid multiplication of accomplices, whenever a\r\npersecution commenced. Animated by the prospect thus opened, the\r\ninquisitors threw aside their caution; they accepted the most absurd\r\nstories and attributed to witchcraft many cases of ordinary sickness\r\noccurring in the town. They erected additional prisons to receive the\r\nculprits and sentenced to burning two of those accused as\r\nleaders--negresses named Elena de Vitoria and Paula de Eguiluz, but the\r\nsentence of the former was revoked by the Suprema and, when that of the\r\nlatter was received, it sent orders that no sentence of relaxation\r\nshould be executed until a copy of the process was submitted to it.\r\n\r\nTorture was freely employed, resulting in an auto de fe held, March 26,\r\n1634, where twenty-one witches were exhibited, whose punishment mostly\r\nconsisted of scourging, although one, Ana de Avila, a mestiza widow, who\r\nhad overcome seven turns of the _mancuerda_ in her torture, was fined\r\n1000 pesos. A sentence of absolution was read of Ana Beltran, who had\r\nbeen tortured without confession for an hour and a half and had died of\r\nits effects. This was followed, June 1, 1636, by another auto with\r\nsixteen penitents, among whom was Elena de Vitoria. Another was Guiomar\r\nde Anaya, who had overcome the torture and was sentenced to exile and a\r\nfine of 200 ducats. Paula de Eguiluz was reconciled in an auto of March\r\n25, 1638, after six years of imprisonment, and was condemned to two\r\nhundred lashes and irremissible prison. It seems that she enjoyed a high\r\nreputation as a physician and was allowed to leave the prison in the\r\npractice of her profession, numbering among her patients even the\r\ninquisitors and the bishop, Cristóbal de Lazárraga. She was permitted to\r\ncast off the sanbenito and appeared in a mantle bordered with gold and\r\nin a sedan chair; she earned much money and was charitable in relieving\r\nthe necessities of her fellow-prisoners.[775]\r\n\r\nIn the other chief source of inquisitorial business--blasphemy--the\r\nmercifulness of the Suprema brought about a curious and unexpected\r\nresult. The most usual expletive, _reniego á Dios_--I renounce God--was\r\nreckoned as heretical and therefore subject to the jurisdiction of the\r\nHoly Office, but it was so frequent that the Suprema ordered it to be\r\npunished only with a reprimand. As the inquisitors complained, in a\r\nletter of June 28, 1619, the effect of this was that, when a master\r\nflogged a slave, at the first lash the latter promptly renounced God; he\r\nthus became, on the spot, subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the\r\ntribunal; the flogging ceased and he was handed over to it, to go\r\nthrough the formality of a trial, at the end of which he was discharged\r\nwith a scolding. This was a process which might be repeated\r\nindefinitely, to the manifest detriment of the discipline indispensable\r\nto slavery.[776]\r\n\r\nIt was not till the tribunal had been established for more than ten\r\nyears that it had any serious business in vindicating the faith. In an\r\nauto de fe celebrated March 16, 1622, there were four negro witches\r\nreconciled, two negro sorceresses punished and one bigamist banished\r\nfrom the Indies. In addition to these there was a Protestant burnt\r\nalive--an Englishman named Adam Edon (Haydon?). He had been sent, in\r\n1618, by an English merchant, to purchase tobacco in Cumaná, where he\r\nwas arrested in 1619 and sent to Cartagena. For two years the most\r\nearnest endeavors to wean him from his errors were fruitless, and his\r\nfate was inevitable. Mañozca, in his report, described him as a most\r\nengaging person; at the _quemadero_ he was not chained as usual to the\r\nstake, but he calmly sat on a faggot and remained motionless till life\r\nwas extinct, a veritable martyr to his convictions.[777]\r\n\r\nAfter this auspicious beginning there opened a prospect of greater\r\nusefulness. At an auto de fe of June 17, 1626, solemnized with great\r\nmagnificence, there were twenty-two penitents, of whom one was a\r\nCalvinist and seven were Judaizers. Of the latter, Juan Vicente had\r\nalready been reconciled in Coimbra and again in Lima. Under the canon\r\nlaw, a single relapse entailed relaxation; this he had been spared in\r\nLima, and his persistent backsliding left no hope of ultimate\r\nconversion, so he was duly consigned to the flames.[778] After this\r\nthere was an interval during which inquisitorial energy had to be\r\ncontent with witches, blasphemers and the like, until the raid made on\r\nthe Portuguese merchants in Lima gave occasion for similar action in\r\nCartagena. One of the accused, in the former city, gave evidence against\r\na compatriot in the latter; it was duly forwarded and the arrest was\r\nmade March 15, 1636. The circle spread until there were twenty-one in\r\nprison. Torture was savagely employed and one of the prisoners, Paz\r\nPinto, a man widely esteemed, died from its effects. Most of the cases\r\nwere ready for an auto held March 25, 1638, at which eight were\r\nreconciled and nine were absolved. There were no relaxations, but the\r\nconfiscations, as we shall see, put the tribunal in possession of ample\r\nfunds.[779]\r\n\r\nLittle remains to be said as to the activity of the tribunal in its\r\nappropriate sphere, although its contributions from time to time to the\r\nSuprema show that it occasionally obtained some wealthy penitent to\r\nstrip, among the inconspicuous mass of blasphemers, bigamists and\r\nsorceresses. Its energies became more and more devoted, during the\r\nremainder of the century, to internal dissensions and quarrels with the\r\nsecular and ecclesiastical authorities, leaving small leisure for its\r\nproper functions. Such was its inertia in this respect that we are told\r\nthat there was no publication of the annual Edict of Faith between 1656\r\nand 1818.[780] Then it was dealt a heavy blow in the capture of\r\nCartagena, in 1697, by the French adventurers under the Baron de Pointis\r\nand his buccaneer allies, after which it was sacked by the latter. A few\r\ndays after the commencement of the bombardment April 10th, the tribunal\r\nabandoned the city, carrying some of its prisoners to Majates, about\r\nfourteen leagues distant, where an auto de fe was held, with three\r\npenitents, and those whose cases were not ready were sent further inland\r\nto Mompox. When the fort of Bocachica was taken, the French found there\r\nnine prisoners accused of bigamy; eight of these joined the enemy and\r\nthe ninth, Pedro Sarmiento, voluntarily went to Mompox and surrendered\r\nhimself. The town capitulated May 6th and, when the French entered, they\r\npromptly sought the Inquisition, where they took the vestments of the\r\nofficials and the sanbenitos and mitres of the penitents and held in the\r\nplaza a mock auto de fe, reading sentences and parodying the\r\nsolemnities. Inquisitor Lazaeta was anxious to obtain possession of\r\ncertain papers and employed the good offices of Don Sancho Jimeno, the\r\ncastellan of Bocachica, whose gallant defence had earned the respect of\r\nthe enemy. He had been rereleased but returned to Cartagena to defend\r\nhimself against certain charges, after which he requested of the leaders\r\npermission to get the papers; the mere mention of the Inquisition\r\nprovoked a tempest of passion, but after it had cooled off he asked\r\nleave to get some papers of his own and, while collecting them, he\r\nsucceeded in including those desired by the inquisitor. After the\r\ninvaders had sailed, Lazaeta returned to Cartagena, June 22d. He found\r\nthe building much damaged by the bombardment; it had been sacked and the\r\nchests broken open and left empty, but the records were untouched. With\r\na donation which he begged and 12,000 pesos obtained from the governor,\r\nhe had everything in order by the end of August, but this proved the\r\nturning-point of the tribunal which thenceforth declined rapidly.[781]\r\n\r\nRepairs to its habitation became necessary in 1704, but these were\r\ninefficiently performed and, in 1715, the tribunal was obliged to shift\r\nits quarters to the house of the senior inquisitor and even this had\r\nbeen so maltreated in the bombardment that it threatened to fall. The\r\ntrouble culminated in 1741 when Admiral Vernon bombarded Cartagena; a\r\nbomb dismantled the Inquisition and it had to be torn down, though the\r\nrecords escaped as they had prudently been transferred in advance to\r\nTenerife, near Santa Marta. It was a quarter of a century before Carlos\r\nIII, in 1766, granted for the rebuilding 12,600 pesos from the revenues\r\nof the vacant archbishopric.[782]\r\n\r\nAll this was but a symptom of the general decadence of the tribunal. In\r\n1747 the Inquisitor, Francisco Antonio de Ilarduy, wrote that the only\r\nconsultor he had was also the advocate of the fisc and of the accused;\r\nfor three years there had been but one calificador, and the provincial\r\nat Seville had been vainly urged to send out frailes; there were but two\r\nfamiliars, who were engrossed in earning their living and no one cared\r\nto accept the position; for seven years the Suprema had not taken the\r\ntrouble to reply to the applications for advice and instructions.\r\nIlarduy vainly tendered his resignation, but it was not accepted until\r\nat length he obtained a transfer to Córdova and left Cartagena in 1754.\r\nUnder such conditions there was little done and the Inquisition lost its\r\nterrors. The royal permission to draw articles of necessity from foreign\r\nsources brought to Cartagena Danish, Dutch and other heretic ships, in\r\nwhich there came Jews whom the governor, in spite of the reclamations of\r\nthe tribunal, allowed to establish themselves and to walk the streets\r\nlike natives. The tribunal appealed to the Archbishop-viceroy, Antonio\r\nCaballero y Góngora, who contented himself with ordering that the\r\nlimitation of importations to articles of necessity should be\r\nenforced.[783]\r\n\r\nA typical case was that of Don David de la Mota, who came in 1783, and\r\nwho made no secret of being a Jew. The tribunal summoned him and swore\r\nhim in the Jewish fashion, when he said that he was born in\r\nVelez-Malaga; his parents had been penanced and his grandfather had been\r\nburnt by the tribunal of Granada; he had married a Jewess in the Danish\r\nisland of Santa Cruz and had been circumcised fifty years before in\r\nSanta Eustacia. It indicates the altered situation when this case, which\r\nformerly would have been treated with little ceremony, was the subject\r\nof doubt and discussion. The inquisitors forbore to arrest him, for he\r\nrepresented foreign interests, which would have complained to the consul\r\nand he to the ambassador. They accordingly shrank from the\r\nresponsibility and let him go. In Spain the exclusion of Jews was still\r\nrigidly enforced and, when they reported their action to the Suprema, it\r\ncensured their timidity and ordered them always to arrest such parties\r\nwhen the evidence sufficed. It was the same in other parts of the\r\ndistrict. In Santo Domingo the governor was liberally inclined and, in\r\n1783, the Archbishop complained to the Suprema that, during the previous\r\nyear, a Jew named José Obediente had come and was allowed to go about\r\nfreely, to entertain persons of distinction and even to be present in\r\nthe solemnities of Holy Week. The commissioner had vainly appealed to\r\nthe authorities, and the archbishop was afraid to say anything, for fear\r\nof public disturbance. This year he had come again, bringing six or\r\nseven others, who kept house and lived like any other residents.[784] It\r\nwas not the Jews alone whom the tribunal, in its weakened state, was\r\nafraid to attack. In 1784, the royal auditor at Mompox, Don Francisco\r\nAntonio Antona, was denounced for having, at a banquet given by a\r\npriest, proposed for discussion some manifestly heretical propositions.\r\nIn place of prosecuting him, the inquisitors consulted the Suprema\r\nalleging, as a reason for their timidity, the character of the accused,\r\nthe relations of his wife with the best families, and the protection\r\ngiven to him by the viceroys in the conduct of his office.[785] A\r\ntribunal thus shorn of its audacity could only be an object of contempt.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, a little recrudescence of activity as the progress\r\nof free-thought and the approach of the Revolution called for the\r\nexercise of the functions of censorship. This has been well-nigh in\r\nabeyance. The edicts prohibiting books, as sent out by the Suprema, were\r\nregularly published as matters of routine, but they were regarded by no\r\none. In fact, the intellectual torpor of the colony was so profound that\r\nthere was little danger of the spread of dangerous literature. In 1777\r\nCartagena could not even support a small printing-office, and the\r\ninquisitors complained that they had to copy the edicts by hand; there\r\nhad been a printer, but the poor man had sold his stock elsewhere and no\r\none had ventured to replace him.[786] Seizures of prohibited books had\r\nbeen exceedingly rare. In 1661 some copies had been suppressed of “Horas\r\ny oraciones devotas,” printed in Paris in 1664. In 1668 there was a\r\nlittle flurry when, on one of the affluents of the Orinoco, a Dutchman\r\nwas found in possession of copies of a work in Spanish, apparently\r\nprinted in Holland, entitled “Epistola á los Peruleros,” consisting of a\r\nCalvinistic catechism and exhorting the colonists to withdraw their\r\nallegiance from Spain and ally themselves with the Dutch, whose colony\r\nof Guiana was dangerously near. In 1732 a little book called “Paraiso\r\ndel alma” was seized in Santa Fe and, in 1757, some copies of Bishop\r\nPalafox’s “Ejercicios devotos.” The moral phase of censorship had\r\nmanifested itself in 1736, when the commissioner at Panamá took from the\r\nFrench astronomers, on their way to the equator to measure an arc of the\r\nearth’s surface, an engraving of a woman which he regarded as indecent,\r\nbut when he sought to get possession of another, said to be even worse,\r\nthey assured him that it had been burnt and threatened to complain to\r\nthe king of the insult offered to them. So, in 1807, there were\r\ndenounced to the tribunal some watches brought by a Danish vessel, of\r\nwhich the cases were enamelled with indecent pictures; the enamels were\r\ndestroyed and the watches were restored to the owner.[787]\r\n\r\nIn 1774 a more difficult question was forced upon the tribunal. José\r\nCelestino Mutis, distinguished both as priest and physician and\r\nprofessor in the Colegio Mayor of Santa Fe, in 1773, presided over some\r\nconclusions in which the Copernican theory of the solar system was\r\ndefended. In June, 1774, the Dominicans of the Universidad Tomistica\r\nresolved to celebrate other conclusions to prove the contrary by\r\nScripture and St. Augustin and St. Thomas, and that the Copernican\r\ntheory was intolerable for Catholics, indefensible and prohibited by the\r\nInquisition. Mutis addressed a defence of Copernicus to the viceroy, who\r\nsent a copy to the commissioner; he transmitted it to the tribunal,\r\nwhich submitted it to two calificadores. One of these reported that the\r\npropositions were not subject to theological censure; the other held\r\nthat the Copernican system was opposed to Scripture and no Catholic\r\ncould defend it. The matter then passed into the hands of the\r\ninquisitor-fiscal, who argued that all authors of greatest repute\r\ndetested the system as absolutely contrary to Scripture, repeatedly\r\ncondemned by the Roman Inquisition and, as some say, by Urban VIII. He\r\nwas especially shocked by an assertion of Mutis that the king had\r\nordered all Spanish universities to teach the works of Newton which were\r\nbased on Copernicus. Dr. Mutis, he added, was the first and only one\r\nwho, in this kingdom and perhaps in all America, had publicly declared\r\nhimself in favor of this system. Thereupon the tribunal, at a loss what\r\nto do in a matter beyond its comprehension, sent all the papers to the\r\nSuprema for instructions, and the latter discreetly filed them away\r\nwithout answering.[788]\r\n\r\nOf more practical importance was the manifesto of the French Constituent\r\nAssembly on the rights of man, of which a Spanish version appeared under\r\nthe title of _Derechos del Hombre_. This was condemned in Cartagena by\r\nedict published December 13, 1789. Then, in 1794, there was a sudden\r\ncommand for its vigorous suppression. In almost identical phrase the\r\nViceroys of New Granada and Peru wrote to their respective tribunals,\r\ndescribing it as a work destructive of social order and advocating\r\ntoleration. Every pains, they said, must be taken to hunt up every copy\r\nand to ascertain when and how and from whom they came. The tribunals\r\naccordingly exerted their utmost diligence, but were not rewarded by\r\nfinding a single copy.[789] Probably equal ill-success attended their\r\nefforts to obey the orders of the Suprema to suppress _Gli Animali\r\nparlanti_ of Giambattista Casti and to spare no pains in ascertaining\r\nthe possessors of the poem which, as a clever satire directed against\r\nthe vices and follies of kings and courts, was especially distasteful to\r\nan autocratic monarch. The work had appeared in Paris in 1802 and these\r\norders came from the Suprema under date of May 23, 1803, although the\r\nformal decree suppressing it was not issued until June 23, 1805, to be\r\nfollowed, August 6th, by a similar papal prohibition.[790]\r\n\r\nIf the results of the labors of the tribunal in defence of the faith\r\nwere thus meagre, it was far more successful in its true vocation of\r\ncreating scandal, by incessant quarrels with the civil and\r\necclesiastical authorities, and by its internal discords. Hardly had it\r\nbeen organized when the Easter solemnities of 1611 offered occasion for\r\ndissension, over questions of etiquette and precedence, with the secular\r\nand spiritual powers, giving rise to antagonism throughout the district,\r\nespecially on the part of the bishops, who grudged the deprivation of\r\nthe jurisdiction which they had been accustomed to exercise in matters\r\nof faith. They continued to disregard the exclusive functions of the\r\ninquisitors, who complained bitterly of them as ignorant prelates, with\r\nofficials whose ignorance was equalled by their turbulence; they had few\r\nduties to occupy them and they desired to retain this jurisdiction\r\nbecause of the hold which it gave them over their subjects. It probably\r\nwould be unjust to estimate them by one of their number, Fray Juan\r\nGonzález de Mendoza, Bishop of Popayan, who, on his arrival at Cartagena\r\nin 1610, introduced the practice of divination with sticks, which he\r\nasserted to be allowed by the Inquisition and to be used by the queen\r\nand the Duke of Lerma. It spread rapidly among all classes and, as all\r\ndivination was held to imply pact with the demon, the inquisitors were\r\ngreatly exercised and inquired anxiously of the Suprema, January 31,\r\n1611, what they should do about it, to which apparently they received no\r\nanswer.[791]\r\n\r\nMañozca, arrogant, unscrupulous and ambitious, was the leading spirit of\r\nthe tribunal. He speedily made it apparent that, under his guidance, it\r\nwas to be the dominant power in the community, and that its awful\r\nauthority was to be restrained by no considerations of law or justice.\r\nThe governor, Diego Fernández de Velasco, was good-natured and made\r\nevery effort to keep on good terms with the inquisitors, but his\r\nmoderation only encouraged their insolence and at length, in a letter of\r\nJuly 4, 1613, to the king, he poured forth his grievances. The tribunal,\r\nhe said, sought to render itself the supreme master and had become so\r\nfeared that the whole province was terrorized, so that, not only for the\r\ninquisitors but for their servants and slaves, there was no law but\r\ntheir own will. They were accustomed to arrest butchers, fishermen,\r\nbakers and other dealers in provisions; to seize with violence the goods\r\nof merchants and to summon and scold them for objecting. In two cases\r\nMañozca forced parties who imported cargoes of slaves to give him some\r\nof them, whom he sold. They took, without notice, prisoners from the\r\npublic prisons and, on one occasion, when the gaoler asked for a\r\nvoucher, as requisite for his justification, the messenger wounded him\r\non the head with his sword and was not punished. The governor added\r\nnumerous instances of outrages on all classes, winding up with himself,\r\nas having been publicly proclaimed as excommunicated in all the\r\nchurches.[792]\r\n\r\nThe regular Orders had equal cause of complaint and managed, with some\r\ntrouble, to send to Spain a procurator to represent that everything in\r\nthe convents was regulated by Mañozca’s powerful hand, whence it\r\nresulted that many estimable frailes were unjustly punished, while those\r\nwere untouched who deserved to be castigated and reformed. This brought\r\nupon Mañozca, from the Suprema, a severe reprimand with orders to\r\nabstain from such interference.[793] Apparently the warning was\r\ndisregarded if we may believe a memorial addressed by a fraile, May 12,\r\n1619, to the king, representing that to leave Mañozca at his post was to\r\nkeep a monster in the seat of an angel of light. This was substantiated\r\nwith ample details of his scandalous mode of life, his nocturnal sallies\r\nin disguise and the general terror which he inspired, for terrorism was\r\nthe means by which he had become the ruler of all. When the secular\r\nauthorities sought to banish the courtezans and concubines he prevented\r\nit and, when the preachers preached against them, he issued what he\r\ncalled an _instruccion de predicadores_ in which he called them\r\ndishonoring names and covered them with ridicule. The writer relates a\r\nnumber of cases by which it appears that Mañozca controlled the local\r\ncourts and officials, dictating sentences and procuring that his\r\nsupporters escaped justice and won their suits, however unrighteous.\r\nMoreover he gave occasion for an indefinite amount of smuggling;\r\narrivals were reported to him in advance of the custom officials, and he\r\nreceived bribes--negro slaves and other things of value--to enable the\r\nowners to defraud the customs--a matter presumably easy of\r\naccomplishment through the supervision of all arrivals, by which the\r\nInquisition was empowered to prevent the intrusion of heretics and the\r\nimportation of heretic books.[794]\r\n\r\nQuarrels with the bishops were incessant and only the bishop of Cuba,\r\nAlfonso Henríquez de Almendáriz, who was old and self-willed and prompt\r\nin quarrel, held his own, leading to numerous complaints of him by the\r\ntribunal.[795] Then, towards the middle of 1619, there came a new\r\ngovernor, García Giron, with whom there was speedily trouble. A negro\r\nslave of Inquisitor Salcedo was refused meat by a negro in the market;\r\nhe complained to his master who gave him a paper requiring the dealer to\r\nsupply it. Armed with this, he struck the negro several times with the\r\nflat of a _machete_, took what meat he wanted and told the man that, if\r\nhe wanted pay, he could send for the money. Thereupon Giron ordered a\r\nprosecution; the inquisitors sent for the notary employed in it and\r\nordered him to surrender the papers under the customary threat of fine\r\nand excommunication; the governor ordered him not to obey, but he was\r\nfinally obliged to pay the fine and deliver the papers.[796]\r\n\r\nComplaints against Mañozca came pouring in upon the Suprema, especially\r\nfrom members of the regular Orders, including whole convents, until it\r\nfound itself obliged to have an investigation made into his life and\r\nmorals. The result justified the accusations and it ordered him to\r\npresent himself in Madrid. He had no trouble in gathering\r\ncertificates--which no one dared to refuse--as to his good character and\r\nconduct, with which he sailed for Spain, towards the end of July, 1620.\r\nThere he succeeded so completely in exonerating himself that, in April,\r\n1621, the inquisitor-general wrote that his presence in the court being\r\nno longer necessary, for the business on which he had been summoned, he\r\nhad been ordered to return to his post. Thus, after a year’s absence, he\r\nreoccupied his seat in the tribunal, but only for a short time. With the\r\ncustomary policy of the Holy Office, he was promoted to the more\r\nimportant tribunal of Lima, to be elevated, in 1643, as we have seen, to\r\nthe archbishopric of Mexico. He remained, however, in Cartagena, until\r\nthe arrival of his successor, Agustin de Ugarte y Saravia, in the middle\r\nof 1623.[797]\r\n\r\nDuring his absence at the court, his colleague Salcedo had become\r\ninvolved in a furious quarrel with the bishop, Diego de Torris\r\nAltamirano, by forcibly taking from his prison a priest named Pedro de\r\nQuesada, condemned to degradation and death for robbery and murder.\r\nQuesada, through his confessor, informed the tribunal that he had a\r\ndeposition to make; Salcedo sent a message informally to the provisor to\r\nsend the culprit, who would be returned, but when the messenger went for\r\nhim, he was found fast in the stocks and the key carried off. The bishop\r\ndeclared that he should not be delivered without a written demand, but\r\nSalcedo sent a party of familiars, who carried him off by force and then\r\nreturned him within an hour--the object being simply to humiliate the\r\nbishop and demonstrate the superior authority of the Inquisition.[798]\r\nSalcedo and Altamirano both died in 1621, but the new bishop, Francisco\r\nde Sotomayor, who arrived in 1622, became immediately involved in a\r\nserious quarrel with Mañozca, which had to be referred to Spain for\r\nsettlement.[799]\r\n\r\nIn 1630 the Council of Indies presented to Philip IV a formal complaint\r\nin thirty-four articles against the tribunal of Cartagena, which very\r\nprobably contributed to the enactment of the Concordia of 1633.[800]\r\nMeanwhile a new governor, Francisco de Murga, had resolutely undertaken\r\nto abate the insolence of the inquisitors and had become involved in\r\nspecially bitter quarrels with the inquisitor Vélez de Asas y Argos, who\r\nhad been promoted, in 1626, from the position of fiscal. In a letter of\r\nDecember 12, 1632, the inquisitors describe him as the most dangerous\r\nman on earth, for he daily framed a thousand devices to trip them up\r\nand, if this could not be stopped, there would be no living in the city.\r\nHe was certainly audacious for one day he took from the executioner a\r\nnegro who was being scourged through the streets for heresy. For this\r\nthey excommunicated him, but when they sent officials and familiars to\r\nnotify him, he clapped them all into gaol and held them there under\r\nheavy guard for twenty-four hours. Then he called a junta in the house\r\nof the bishop and, by its advice, asked for absolution, which was\r\nadministered in a manner so humiliating that the Council of Indies\r\npresented a formal complaint to the king. This did not tend to harmony\r\nand the quarrel went on, to the discomfiture of the tribunal, showing\r\nwhat a determined man could do, when supported by the universal\r\ndetestation in which the Inquisition was held. In fact, as the\r\ninquisitors complained, in a letter of August 8, 1633, the mass of the\r\npeople held them in mortal hatred, which they could explain only by the\r\nwiles of the devil seeking to obstruct their pious work.[801]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the home authorities were leisurely engaged in endeavoring to\r\nreconcile the irreconcileable. A consulta of the Suprema, March 23,\r\n1633, suggested measures to that effect but in vain. Philip IV adopted a\r\nmore practical course in ordering the Suprema to summon Vélez to Spain,\r\nbut it disobeyed and, when he repeated the order, it replied, May 3,\r\n1635, that it was ready to obey but had deferred in expectation of his\r\nreplying to its consulta of May 26, 1634; besides, it had not yet\r\nreceived the papers containing the inquisitors’ side of the matter. To\r\nthis the king replied by curtly commanding immediate compliance, but it\r\nstill dallied and it was not until 1636 that Vélez was compelled to\r\nsail for Spain. At the same time the Suprema admitted the fault of the\r\ntribunal by ordering the inquisitors, March 15, 1636, not to plot and\r\nconspire against Murga nor, after his retirement, against his deputy and\r\nofficials. The sincerity of this was soon put to the test. Murga had\r\ndied before Vélez left Cartagena and, in April, 1636, the tribunal was\r\ndelighted to receive orders to arrest his deputy, Francisco de Llano\r\nValdés, who was asserted to be the cause of all the troubles. The order\r\nwas joyfully obeyed, but to little effect. In prison Llano Valdés became\r\nintimate with Inquisitor Cortázar, for both were Biscayans; a false\r\ncertificate of illness was procured from the physician and he was given\r\nhis house as a prison; he was soon seen on the streets again and was\r\neven called in frequently to administer torture, as the tribunal had no\r\nofficial skilled in the art.[802]\r\n\r\nThe death of Murga did not end the debate, which was transferred to\r\nSpain, where Vélez arrived in December, 1636. It dragged on with\r\ncustomary procrastination. The Suprema urged his return to Cartagena,\r\ndeclaring that his service had been most satisfactory, and that he had\r\nbeen dishonored by being summoned to Spain without cause, which could\r\nonly be repaired by his restoration. The Council of Indies insisted that\r\nhe had exposed Cartagena to destruction and that he should be provided\r\nfor with a post in Spain. Philip IV sought to compromise the matter by\r\ndeciding against his return and that he should have one of the best\r\nSpanish tribunals--it being the ordinary policy of the Inquisition that\r\nwhen a man had proved his unfitness in one position, he should be\r\npromoted to a higher station in which to exercise his powers of evil.\r\nFinally it was settled that he should have the great tribunal of Mexico,\r\nbut the commander of the fleet, Don Carlos de Ibarra, ordered him to\r\ntake ship direct to Honduras and made public proclamation that no one\r\nshould receive him on board or carry him to Cartagena, under pain of\r\ntreason and confiscation. Then the Suprema, September 30, 1639, made a\r\nfinal effort to obtain his restoration to Cartagena, but this failed and\r\nhe at last took his seat in the Mexican tribunal.[803]\r\n\r\nVélez had been on terms not much better with his colleague, Martin de\r\nCortázar y Ascarate, who accused him of endeavoring to encompass the\r\ndeath of Llano Valdés in prison and of seeking to rule the tribunal with\r\na faction of the officials, consisting of the fiscal Juan Ortiz, his\r\nson, the secretary Luis Blanco and the other secretary, Juan de Uriarte,\r\nfather-in-law of Blanco. As for Cortázar himself, two of the consultors,\r\nJuan de Cuadros Peña and Rodrigo de Oviedo, wrote to the Suprema, August\r\n10, 1635, representing his utter ignorance; he knew no Latin and his\r\nCastilian was so imperfect as to be unintelligible; he was proud and\r\nhaughty and his cruelty was evinced by the savage tortures which he\r\ninflicted on the accused. Then, on November 16, 1640, Ortiz was promoted\r\nto the inquisitorship and his family had complete control.[804]\r\n\r\nThey used their power for their own enrichment, dividing among\r\nthemselves the moneys in the coffer and paying no debts unless they were\r\nbribed. That they should soon be involved in strife with the\r\nmunicipality, was inevitable. In 1641 an excessive scarcity caused by\r\nthe ravages of locusts led the cabildo, or city authorities, to\r\nprescribe maximum prices for provisions and to order an examination into\r\nthe quantities of produce in the several plantations, so as to prevent\r\nexportation. Ortiz and his officials claimed exemption from these\r\nregulations; he ordered the secretary of the cabildo to furnish him with\r\nits proceedings, that he might see which of the regidores voted for\r\nthem, so that he might imprison them, as was done with Don Cristóval de\r\nBermúdez and Don Baltasar de Escovar, on complaint of the servants of\r\nthe officials, for distributing provisions equally--arbitrary\r\nimprisonment without observing any formalities or opportunity for\r\ndefence. Then, as the secretary did not comply with the demand, he was\r\nsimilarly thrown in prison. When meat was brought into the city for\r\ndistribution the servants of the officials claimed whole carcasses,\r\nwhich they cut up and retailed at excessive prices. Driven to\r\nextremities, the city complained to the king of the violence of the\r\ntribunal and the excesses of its officials, when Ortiz again demanded a\r\ncopy of the proceedings of the cabildo, leading to further intolerable\r\nvexations, which caused it to send the regidor, Nicolás Heras Pantoja as\r\nprocurator to ask for a visitador.[805]\r\n\r\nThis imprisonment in the secret prison, we may remark, was an inveterate\r\nabuse; it was in itself the severest punishment, as it implied heresy\r\nand inflicted indelible infamy on the individual and his posterity. It\r\nwas the subject of repeated complaints and, at last, a consulta of the\r\nCouncil of Indies, June 14, 1646, led the king to order the Suprema to\r\ninstruct the Cartagena tribunal not to molest the people; when any one\r\nwas arrested for matters not of faith, he must be placed in a decent\r\nprison, outside of the Inquisition. The Suprema had already taken such\r\naction in letters of April 28, 1645, and it repeated this July 28, 1646.\r\nYet a letter from Cartagena of June 10, 1649, represented that, in spite\r\nof these orders, the inquisitors continued to throw many people into the\r\nsecret prison, for causes not of faith, till at length three citizens\r\nwho had been thus dishonored supplicated the king to remedy the great\r\ninjuries thus inflicted. The Council of Indies, in a consulta of\r\nFebruary 21, 1650, represented strongly to the king the disorders\r\narising from the disregard of his commands and urged that positive\r\norders to obey be given to the inquisitors. This he sent with his\r\nendorsement to the Suprema, which, on April 8th, wrote to the tribunal\r\nto observe its previous instructions--but without producing permanent\r\neffect.[806]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the prayer of the city for a visitador had been answered after\r\na fashion, though not in consequence of its supplication. According to a\r\nstatement of the Suprema in 1646, it had, at the close of 1642,\r\ndetermined to send an inspector to Lima and Cartagena, as those\r\ntribunals had not been visited since their foundation. There had\r\nrecently been great sequestrations and confiscations, giving rise in\r\nLima to over two thousand lawsuits, while in Cartagena it was necessary\r\nto investigate the settlements made with the claimants and the net\r\ncollections secured. There were no charges, it said, against the\r\ninquisitors and it was only the financial matters that were concerned.\r\nThere was hesitation as to the selection of a visitor; he had to be an\r\nold inquisitor and no one would accept the position without the\r\nassurance of a good benefice in the Indies or of a place in the Suprema\r\nitself. To give him more authority it was resolved to make him a member\r\nof the Suprema and to swear him in before his departure. Unfortunately\r\nthe choice fell upon Dr. Martin Real, then serving in the tribunal of\r\nToledo, a man of learning and imbued with the highest conceptions of\r\ninquisitorial authority, who had acted as visitor in Sicily, where he\r\nearned the reputation of a breeder of troubles, through his ungovernable\r\ntemper and headstrong character. This was known to the Suprema, but it\r\nwas thought that what he had suffered in consequence of it and the\r\nwarnings that would be given would render him cautious. Philip IV\r\nobjected, in view of what had occurred in Sicily, and suggested other\r\nnames, but yielded on condition that he should not take the oath as\r\ncouncillor until the day of his departure. Then the Council of Indies\r\nprotested against the appointment as dangerous to the peace of the\r\ncolonies, but the Suprema represented that the matter had gone too far\r\nto be reconsidered without disgracing Real; that the opposition came\r\nfrom those who desired to prevent the visitation and that it did not\r\nconcern the inquisitors but only the confiscations. The king made no\r\nfurther objection and Real was duly commissioned and departed early in\r\n1643.[807]\r\n\r\nThe result justified fully the apprehensions of Philip and the Council\r\nof Indies, but it may be doubted whether the most even-tempered visitor,\r\nhonestly bent on performing his duty, could have averted an explosion.\r\nThe object of the mission was the investigation of the finances; there\r\ncan be little question that, as in the other tribunals, false reports\r\nhad been made as to the results of the enormous confiscations accruing\r\nfrom the prosecution of the Judaizing New Christians, and an inspection\r\nof the accounts was to be prevented at all hazards. The city was in a\r\nstate of combustion with the chronic quarrels between the tribunal and\r\nthe civil and military authorities. Real’s temper would not allow him to\r\nbe neutral and it was easy to create a situation which should preclude\r\nthe dreaded investigation. Such, at least, is the most rational\r\nexplanation of the events as they can be disentangled from the somewhat\r\nconflicting accounts that have reached us.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of July, 1643, Real arrived in Cartagena and with him\r\ncame a new inquisitor, Juan Bautista de Villadiego, a man nearly seventy\r\nyears of age, and a fiscal, Pedro Triunfo de Socaya. Real’s first act\r\nwas to forbid Ortiz and Uriarte from entrance to the secreto, evidently\r\nwith a view of examinating their accounts without interference, at the\r\nsame time handing them appointments to equivalent positions in Llerena\r\nand Logroño--the favorite method used by the Suprema when officials had\r\ndestroyed their usefulness where they were. Villadiego however refused\r\nto let Real have the keys of the money-chest, so the object of his\r\nvisitation was frustrated and he revenged himself by exceeding the\r\npowers of his commission and assuming control of the tribunal. To obtain\r\nthe keys of the coffer he led a disorderly crowd to Villadiego’s house,\r\nbroke it open, personally assaulted him, seized the furniture and sold\r\nit at auction to pay the fine which he had imposed on him. Real further\r\nespoused the cause of the governor and cabildo and interfered by\r\nliberating a secretary whom Villadiego had arrested in order to learn\r\nwho had voted against him. Then Villadiego endeavored to establish a\r\nrival tribunal in his own house and appointed officials to run it, a\r\nschism which lasted for two months, until Real judicially sentenced him\r\nto consider his house as a prison. Villadiego thereupon, on the night of\r\nFebruary 11, 1644, with his own hands, posted notices that Real was\r\nexcommunicated and Real retorted by arresting him.\r\n\r\nHe was replaced by Juan Pereira Castro, who took possession as\r\ninquisitor, August 22, 1644, and lost no time in organizing a faction\r\namong the officials and the clergy against Real and was concerned in\r\nlibels upon him which were posted on the night of September 3d. For\r\nthis, on insufficient evidence, Real arrested Ortiz de la Masa, an\r\necclesiastic of high standing, and proposed to torture him, which\r\ncreated an immense scandal among both clergy and laity. Pereira in vain\r\nendeavored to release him and, on January 25, 1645, he and Real\r\nexchanged excommunications, resulting in an interdict under which the\r\ncity lay for many months. A few days later, on January 28th, Pereira,\r\nthe fiscal Socaya and the notary, Tomás de Vega, locked themselves up in\r\nthe tribunal for fear of arrest, and there they remained for seven\r\nmonths, solacing their self-inflicted captivity with feasting and\r\ngambling, while Real could neither get his salary nor the papers which\r\nwere necessary for the business of his visitation. Many of those whom he\r\nhad treated harshly hurried to Spain and brought suits against him in\r\nthe Suprema, and we hear of Socaya sending with them forty bars of\r\nsilver to substantiate their complaints.\r\n\r\nThe Suprema was not a little perplexed by the turn which affairs had\r\ntaken. It ordered Villadiego to be restored to his place in the\r\ntribunal, an order received February 17, 1645, but it was accompanied\r\nwith a summons to present himself at court within four months. This he\r\ndisobeyed and recommenced to hold a tribunal in his own house, with the\r\nobject, as Pereira wrote in February, 1646, of diverting attention from\r\nthe scandals of his licentious life. To this Villadiego retorted by\r\naccusing Pereira of defending the gaoler in his crimes with female\r\nprisoners and of holding indecent banquets with him and the fiscal. The\r\nonly immediate solution to the troubles seemed to lie in the recall of\r\nReal; he was ordered home and left Cartagena at the end of October,\r\n1645. As the time of his arrival in Spain approached, the Suprema grew\r\nuneasy at the prospect of receiving him as a member and, February 16,\r\n1646, it presented a consulta to Philip IV containing a condensed\r\nnarrative of his doings and representing that his seat in the Council\r\nwas intended, not as a reward for past services but as an incentive to\r\nthose he was to render; his visitation had cost 20,000 pesos and had\r\nbrought no results, nor was it held advisable that he should be allowed\r\nto repeat his performances in Lima. Besides, it would be indecent for\r\nhim to sit in judgement on the numerous suits brought against him in the\r\nSuprema so that, all things being considered, it was suggested that his\r\nmembership should be suspended until those suits were settled--a\r\nsuggestion to which the king cordially assented.[808]\r\n\r\nThe inquisitors were not so busy quarrelling among themselves but that\r\nthey had leisure to keep up dissensions with the secular authorities. A\r\nbitter struggle with the governor was occupying the court in 1644 and\r\n1645, leading the Junta de Guerra de Indias, on November 9th of the\r\nlatter year, to urge that instructions be sent to the tribunal not to\r\nexcommunicate the governor and captain-general on account of the evils\r\nthat would result.[809] Then a consulta of the Council of Indies, March\r\n7, 1647, complained of the invasions of secular jurisdiction, in\r\nviolation of the Concordia of 1610, causing regrettable disturbances. It\r\nalluded especially to a competencia with the royal Audiencia of Santa Fe\r\nover a civil case of the familiar Rodrigo de Oviedo y Luron, in which\r\n1500 pesos were deposited with Capitan Francisco Beltran de Cairedo to\r\nawait the adjudication of the claims of his creditors, when the tribunal\r\nstepped in and seized the money, although it had no jurisdiction over\r\nthe civil cases of familiars. The Council therefore asked that the\r\ntribunal be ordered to abstain from civil cases and that its\r\ncompetencias with the Audiencias of Santa Fe, Panamá and Santo Domingo\r\nbe settled--an appeal to which the king returned no answer, as he\r\ndoubtless transmitted it to the Suprema, where it probably lay\r\nburied.[810]\r\n\r\nAs long as Real was on the ground, Villadiego and Pereira united in\r\nefforts to destroy him, but as soon as he departed they quarrelled and,\r\nin February 1646, Pereira commenced a prosecution against his colleague\r\nfor holding a tribunal in his own house. The only hope of restoring the\r\nInquisition to decency and usefulness seemed to lie in another\r\nvisitation. This time the choice fell upon Pedro de Medina Rico,\r\nInquisitor of Seville, whom we have already met in his subsequent\r\ndischarge of similar duties in Mexico. He arrived in Cartagena, December\r\n11, 1648, and found everything in disorder. As he wrote, May 19, 1649,\r\nthe prisoners were rotting in the dungeons, some of whom had been lying\r\nthere for eight years. He set vigorously at work with the cases, but it\r\nwas difficult to make progress. There was no clock in the city; the\r\nhours were announced by the soldiers of the guard in the streets with a\r\nbell, but they were irregular and little attention was paid to them. The\r\nofficials came late to their duties and left early; Pereira was\r\nespecially brief in his attendance and, when he came, thought of nothing\r\nbut getting away. Medina Rico therefore begged the Suprema to send out a\r\nfitting person to serve as secretary and also two inquisitors of\r\nlearning and probity; Pereira was worthy of severe punishment and ought\r\non no account to be allowed to remain.[811]\r\n\r\nMedina Rico of course was at once involved in bitter antagonism with the\r\nofficials whom he had come to reform; his powers however were limited\r\nand he was unable to use censures or arrest, which put him at a\r\ndisadvantage, and there were no such exhibitions of violence as\r\ncharacterized the visitation of his predecessor. The Governor Pedro\r\nZapata, moreover, took sides with the incumbents and wrote to the\r\nCouncil of Indies complaining that the city had been kept in a turmoil\r\nfor ten years, attributable to the delay of the visitadors in completing\r\ntheir visitations. Real had been there for two years and returned,\r\nleaving the task incomplete and now Medina Rico has been at work for a\r\nyear, with no prospect of completion, on account of which the city is in\r\ngreat affliction, dreading a renewal of former disturbances. Philip\r\ntransmitted this to the Suprema, March 13, 1649, ordering, for the sake\r\nof peace, that Medina Rico be instructed to finish as speedily as\r\npossible. To this the Suprema replied that the illness of Pereira had\r\nthrown the unfinished business of the tribunal on Medina Rico, but that\r\norders had already been despatched to him to complete his task without\r\nloss of time. Zapata continued his complaints and the Marquis of Miranda\r\nde Auta, President of the Audiencia of Santa Fe, joined in condemning\r\nhis arbitrary acts; in civil cases he had arrested the procurators of\r\npleaders and he had issued letters to the judges of the Audiencia\r\nthreatening that in three days they would be posted as excommunicates.[812]\r\n\r\nMedina Rico’s task was difficult for the abuses of the tribunal were so\r\ninveterate that the sharpest measures were necessary. Real’s report,\r\nbased on 231 witnesses, brought sixty-eight charges against Villadiego\r\nand a hundred and thirteen against Pereira, but his hurried departure\r\nhad prevented his submitting it to the accused for their defence and it\r\ntherefore could not be acted upon. Fresh evidence was naturally hard to\r\nobtain. The people knew the power of Pereira and Uriarte and that they\r\nwere favored by the governor and the Bishop of Santa Marta; they had\r\nseen the failure of Real’s visitation and anticipated the same result\r\nfrom the present one, when vengeance would follow on all who deposed\r\nagainst them. Medina Rico was therefore obliged to proceed cautiously.\r\nHe states that he had to take precautions against attempts on his life\r\nby Uriarte and that such fears were not groundless for there was\r\nevidence in his hands that the former notary, Luis Blanco del Salcedo,\r\nwas poisoned by his wife and the Inquisitor Juan Ortiz, then receiver,\r\nwho subsequently married her; Inquisitor Cortázar was poisoned by Ortiz\r\nand Uriarte, who intercepted his letters accusing them to the Suprema.\r\nRodrigo de Oviedo was killed by order of Uriarte, whose accomplice he\r\nhad been. There was, he said, every facility for such crimes in this\r\nland filled with evil negroes; it was held for certain that in this way\r\nperished Bishop Cristóbal de Lazárraga and all his family; to poison was\r\nattributable the death of Juan de Lorrigui, acting fiscal, and also that\r\nof the governor who was in office at the time of his arrival.[813]\r\n\r\nIn spite of these apprehensions he gathered evidence, confirmatory of\r\nReal’s charges and of subsequent misdeeds and, under pressing orders to\r\nbetake himself to Mexico, towards the summer of 1650 he drew up\r\naccusations against the inquisitors and the chief officials. Those\r\nagainst Pereira were virtually the same as Martin Real’s. Villadiego he\r\naccused of friendship with Jews who had been penanced, of receiving\r\ngifts and loans from them and using them as agents to sell goods for\r\nhim; he was continually exacting gifts and abused those who refused them\r\nand there was also his general licentiousness with women. The fiscal,\r\nBernardo de Eyzaguirre, was charged with embezzling the money of the\r\nprisoners. Secretary Uriarte he accused of selling his influence to the\r\nkindred of those on trial, giving them information and advice and\r\narranging to bribe the consultors and episcopal Ordinary; of\r\nencompassing the death of his accomplice Rodrigo de Oviedo, who\r\nthreatened to denounce him; of falsifying the accounts and robbing the\r\ntribunal to the amount of 200,000 pesos; after the death of Cortázar, he\r\nhad a secret door made by which he entered the secreto to commit these\r\nthefts and he embezzled the property of the accused by bribing those in\r\ncharge of it, in addition to all which his life was scandalously\r\nincontinent. Against Juan Ortiz he reproduced the sixty general charges\r\nmade by Real and added seventy-nine special ones of the same\r\ncharacter--bribery, receiving presents, appropriating the property of\r\nprisoners, falsified accounts, subornation and violence--when a butcher\r\ndid not give him the best meat, he summoned him to the tribunal and\r\nstruck him a blow on the head that left him senseless.[814]\r\n\r\nIn July, 1650, there arrived a new fiscal, Juan de Mesa, who was to be\r\nassociated with Medina Rico, in case Uriarte recused him, as in fact he\r\ndid. Pereira had become so apprehensive as to the results of the\r\nvisitation that Mesa, on August 4th, in handing him the charges, told\r\nhim that they would kill him. It so turned out. Pereira took them and\r\npondered over them until midnight. In the morning he sent for a\r\nphysician who at once told him that his case was hopeless and, on the\r\n13th, he was dead. Uriarte followed him to the grave, on February 1,\r\n1651, and Medina Rico’s task was accomplished. He was under orders to\r\nstart for Mexico, but was detained by prolonged illness and did not\r\nleave Cartagena until June 8, 1654.[815]\r\n\r\nThe perennial quarrels with the authorities continued, of which the\r\nCouncil of Indies complained in a consulta to Philip IV, May 14,\r\n1652.[816] Matters were not improved when, about this time, there came a\r\nnew inquisitor, Diego del Corro Carrascal, followed shortly by Pedro de\r\nSalas y Pedroso as fiscal, who was soon promoted to the inquisitorship.\r\nHe was so completely dominated by his senior that the Suprema took him\r\nto task, after which he manifested his independence by perpetual\r\n_discordias_, which left the accused perishing in the prison, awaiting\r\nthe slow decisions in Spain. Corro Carrascal moreover was rebuked by the\r\nSuprema for cruelty and for speculating on the operations of the\r\ntribunal by having the confiscations bought in for him at the auctions\r\nat low prices. His dissolute life was so notorious that Governor Zapata\r\nsaid that his going out at night in disguise and having amours with\r\nmarried women passed into a proverb.[817] The dissension between the\r\ninquisitors grew bitterer until, in 1658, they had a common object of\r\ndislike in a new fiscal, Guerra de Latrás, a man who had had a somewhat\r\ndistinguished career as doctor of laws, professor and author, and who\r\nhad served in various important positions. The Suprema had often\r\nreproved the tribunal for its disregard of established procedure and\r\nGuerra sought to reduce it to order, bringing upon himself the\r\nhostility of the inquisitors, who characterized his representations as\r\nchildish. Early in 1660 he had a fall from his mule and broke his arm,\r\nwhich incapacitated him from writing; the inquisitors refused to allow\r\nhim to employ an assistant and the business of the tribunal was\r\nparalyzed. In 1665 Corro Carrascal was made President of New Granada,\r\nSalas fell sick and was absent for weeks at a time and, in this atrophy,\r\nthe Inquisition ceased to inspire awe or even respect. The opportunity\r\nwas propitious for the secular power to reassert itself, and the\r\nGovernor, Benito de Figueroa y Barrantes, availed himself of it. August\r\n23, 1666, meeting the executioner who was scourging two penitents\r\nthrough the accustomed streets, he sent three of his soldiers to release\r\nthem. The tribunal prosecuted the soldiers and, on the 29th, had two of\r\nthem arrested by its secretary, Gonzalo de Carvajal, who, in the\r\nprocess, fired a shot and had a struggle with one of the soldiers.\r\nFigueroa thereupon surrounded the Inquisition with guards to starve out\r\nthe inmates; Guerra sought an interview and agreed to surrender the\r\nprisoners but, four days later, the governor arrested Carvajal, threw\r\nhim fettered into the public prison, sequestrating his property and\r\ntaking his confession in the torture-chamber. Guerra and Salas proceeded\r\nto prosecute the governor and proclaimed a _cessatio a divinis_. The\r\nbishop intervened and Carvajal was relieved of his chains, but remained\r\nin prison. The affair completely discredited the Inquisition; as the new\r\nfiscal, Montoyo y Angulo, reported, April 16, 1669, there was no petty\r\nofficial who did not think himself able to give orders to those of the\r\ntribunal.[818]\r\n\r\nIt had not, however, as yet reached the depth of its degradation. Salas\r\nhad died, December 28, 1667; Guerra had been promoted some months\r\nearlier to the inquisitorship and he too died March 21, 1671, leaving\r\nthe fiscal Luis de Bruna Rico alone. Then, August 19, 1673, there came a\r\nnew inquisitor, Juan Gómez de Mier, followed, in 1674, by a colleague,\r\nAlvaro Bernardo de Quirós, and a new fiscal, José de Padilla, Bruna Rico\r\nhaving been transferred to Lima. The colleagues speedily quarrelled and\r\nPadilla joined Mier to oppose Quirós. The latter, on his arrival, had\r\nobserved the abuses current in the importation of merchandise and slaves\r\nand wrote on the subject to the Council of Indies. The governor, who was\r\ncompromised, succeeded in winning him over, so that he spent most of his\r\ntime in the governor’s house card-playing and wrote to the Council,\r\nwithdrawing his charges. It was too late, however, for Juan de Mier y\r\nSalinas, a judge at Santa Fe, was commissioned to investigate and came\r\nto Cartagena, where he lodged in the house of his uncle, the Inquisitor\r\nMier. The two commenced making arrests and the inculpated took asylum in\r\nthe churches. Among them was a friend of Quirós, who exerted himself in\r\nvain to protect him, and in failing to do so broke definitely with his\r\ncolleague. He allied himself closely with the governor, for whom he drew\r\nup edicts, notably one in 1678 which, under pretext of a threatened\r\nattack by the French, discharged all the prisoners and put an end to the\r\nprosecutions. He is described as wandering around at all hours of the\r\nday and night, mingling with every body, even dancing in public and\r\nuniversally despised. Mier’s association with his nephew the judge\r\nbrought upon him a shower of denunciations; he held relations with the\r\nEnglish of Jamaica, who sent him negroes; these he entered at night as\r\nprisoners of the Inquisition, guarded by the alguazil mayor, through\r\nwhom, moreover, he sold positions--commissionerships and the like--to\r\nall who would pay for them. The fiscal Padilla shut himself up in his\r\nhouse and would see no one. The master spirit of the tribunal was the\r\nsecretary, Miguel de Echarri, to whom were attributed all the evil deeds\r\nof Mier. Every one went to him for the distribution of favors; his\r\nanteroom was like that of a viceroy and presents were showered upon him;\r\nhe was assiduous in the gambling-houses and, as Fray Juan Cabeza de Vaca\r\nhad written, January 30, 1670, “while he is in this city there will\r\nneither be peace in the tribunal nor will the people be without a demon\r\nto disturb everybody and keep them in open war.”[819]\r\n\r\nThis state of affairs continued for years. Mier was transferred to\r\nMexico and Quirós to Lima in December, 1681, leaving as sole inquisitor\r\nPadilla, who died March 31, 1682, appointing as successor ad interim the\r\nArchdeacon Andrés de Torres. Matters took a new aspect with the arrival,\r\nMarch 27, 1683, of a new inquisitor, Francisco Valera, who had filled\r\nimportant offices in Lima. He dismissed Torres and made Echarri fiscal;\r\nhe gave five hours a day, in the tribunal, to cases of faith and three\r\nhours in his house to affairs of property. He pushed the pending trials\r\nto conclusion and in five months, August 29th, he celebrated an auto de\r\nfe.[820] Under such a man the tribunal was speedily lifted from its\r\ndegradation, but he had the defects of his qualities, and his imperious\r\ntemper speedily involved him in a struggle of which the scandal was\r\ngreater than that of any previous one.[821]\r\n\r\nIn 1681, two years before Valera’s arrival, there had come to Cartagena\r\na new bishop, Manuel de Benavides y Piedrola, who seems to have been\r\nimpulsive and inconsiderate. Almost at once he fell into trouble by\r\nlistening to the prayer of the nuns of Santa Clara, who desired to\r\ntransfer their obedience from the Franciscans to the episcopal provisor,\r\nleading to a contest which was envenomed by the bishop’s endeavor to\r\nrestrain the disorderly intercourse between friars and nuns. Castillo de\r\nla Concha, the President of New Granada, ranged himself against the\r\nbishop, on whom a sentence of banishment was pronounced, to which he\r\nreplied by casting an interdict on the city and leaving it. The populace\r\ntook sides with a vehemence which led to frequent riots and almost to\r\ncivil war, during which the nuns sustained a siege of six months.\r\n\r\nValera, on seeing the condition of affairs, endeavored to make peace and\r\nsought the bishop in his retreat, but was unsuccessful and his\r\ndisappointment was aggravated by the bishop’s refusal to allow him to\r\ncelebrate mass in his own house during the interdict. On his return to\r\nCartagena he boldly celebrated mass, which greatly encouraged the\r\nanti-episcopal faction. Matters however seemed to be settling down,\r\nwhen, by order of President Castillo, Diego de Baños, Bishop of Santa\r\nMarta, came to Cartagena and removed the interdict. The two bishops\r\nexchanged excommunications and the quarrel became fiercer and more\r\nintricate than ever. Castillo ordered Benavides to leave the diocese,\r\nbut he refused and excommunicated the governor and all the authorities;\r\nin fact, his enemies said that he had a mania for such censures and once\r\nexcommunicated an object which he saw through the blinds of a balcony,\r\nwithout knowing whether it was a bag of cocoa or a sack of wool.\r\n\r\nValera was not long in being involved in the conflict. The authorities\r\nhad armed the citizens and broke by force into the cathedral, seizing\r\nthree ecclesiastics, whom the governor threw into the fort of Bocachica;\r\none of them, Baltasar de la Fuente, was a commissioner of the tribunal\r\nand claimed the fuero, but Valera refused to come to his assistance.\r\nWhen, however, the governor ordered Benavides to withdraw the censures,\r\nthe latter excommunicated Gerónimo Isabal, the advocate who signed the\r\nletter, and it chanced that he was also acting advocate of prisoners in\r\nthe tribunal, though without a commission, and Valera sprang to his\r\nassistance and demanded the papers. Benavides retorted with an edict\r\ndeclaring that Isabal was not entitled to the fuero for defect of title,\r\nthat Valera had incurred censures for not protecting la Fuente and that\r\nhe, as episcopal inquisitor, would supply any deficiencies in the\r\ntribunal. One account states that as Valera kept himself housed, the\r\nbishop went there personally and affixed the edict to his door; another\r\nasserts that he led a mob of negroes and mulattos to seize the\r\ninquisitor, who barely escaped by a back door and took refuge in the\r\ntribunal.\r\n\r\nThe edict was printed and posted throughout the town, when the alguazil\r\nmayor of the Inquisition tore it down and arrested the ecclesiastics who\r\nwere concerned in it. Benavides went to the tribunal to rescue them and\r\nwas contumeliously refused admittance; the governor came and a scene\r\nensued, the accounts of which are irreconcileable, but which served\r\nstill further to scandalize the people and inflame the passions of both\r\nsides. The unlucky clerics, after two years of prison, were fined and\r\nexiled. Benavides meanwhile had the cathedral bells tolled for an\r\ninterdict, when all the other bells in the city were rung to drown\r\nthem--a brazen warfare to which the people had become accustomed. Then\r\nhe ordered a _cessatio a divinis_, but the convents refused to observe\r\nit; the Bishop of Santa Marta pronounced it null and Valera posted a\r\ndeclaration that he raised it. The Audiencia of Santa Fe had ordered the\r\nexpulsion of Benavides and now it fined him 4000 pesos for delay in\r\nexecuting the decree. The cathedral was surrounded with guards; the\r\nchapter fortified it, but the Bishop of Santa Marta had the doors broken\r\nopen and ordered the chapter, to declare the see vacant. On their\r\nrefusal, the provisor, treasurer and _maestre-escuela_ were arrested and\r\nthe cathedral was handed over to priests of his faction. A certain Don\r\nGómez de Atienza declared that he wished Benavides had come forward to\r\nresist this desecration, for he would have finished him. The vengeance\r\nof heaven was not long delayed, for that night a tempest of unexampled\r\nviolence burst over Cartagena; the lightning sought out Atienza in the\r\nmidst of his family and slew him, while another bolt struck his farm in\r\nthe country, burnt his granaries and killed his mules. He was buried\r\nwith much pomp by the Bishop of Santa Marta and his dead mules were\r\nhidden, to keep the people in ignorance.\r\n\r\nA new governor, Juan Martínez Pando, on his arrival was ordered by the\r\nAudiencia to remove Benavides, but it was impossible to ship him away,\r\nfor the buccaneers commanded the sea. He was confined in his house under\r\nstrict guard and his temporalities were seized. The clergy and people\r\nwho were faithful to him were arrested, banished and their properties\r\nconfiscated. The nuns of Santa Clara refused to recognize the confessors\r\nappointed for them, when the convent was broken open and in spite of\r\ntheir resistance they were beaten and confined on bread and water, while\r\nsome of them were put in irons. The Archbishop of Santa Fe had ordered\r\nthe Bishop of Santa Marta to retire and leave Benavides in possession,\r\nbut the mandate was taken from the messenger, was pronounced to be\r\nforged, and prosecutions were brought against all who professed\r\nobedience to it.\r\n\r\nMatters took a sudden turn when there came a royal cédula of May 16,\r\n1683, addressed to Valera ordering him to replace Benavides in his see,\r\nwhich he accordingly did with extraordinary pomp. That he was master of\r\nthe situation was generally recognized and peace for a time was\r\nrestored, although he refused the bishop’s demand for the return of the\r\nclergy and domestics whom he had exiled. Then Benavides’ position was\r\nfurther strengthened by a papal brief of November 3, 1683, based wholly\r\non the adverse representations of the Audiencia, ordering the nuns of\r\nSanta Clara to be remitted to his care. Thus the original cause of\r\nquarrel was settled and the troubles which followed were a simple trial\r\nof strength between the episcopacy and the Inquisition.\r\n\r\nPassions had not yet exhausted themselves and the struggle for supremacy\r\nhad not been decided. A new element of discord came with the arrival in\r\nNovember, 1684, of another inquisitor, Juan Ortiz de Zárate, who\r\nregarded Valera as having been timid and irresolute in the quarrel and\r\nboasted of his own unyielding firmness. Causes of dissension were not\r\nlacking and open war broke out when Benavides removed, perhaps with\r\nunnecessary violence, seats which the inquisitors had placed in the\r\nchurch, giving as a reason the “tertulia” or talkative crowd thus\r\nattracted. Thereupon they excommunicated the bishop and ordered his name\r\nto be omitted from the mass, to enforce which they excommunicated, fined\r\nand banished the dean and the Prior of San Agustin for including it. The\r\nbishop had torn down the edicts of his excommunication, had\r\nostentatiously celebrated mass and had ordered the arrest of the clergy\r\nwho would not assist him, which led the tribunal to order him to keep\r\nhis house as a prison, an order enforced by obtaining from the governor\r\na guard which rendered him practically a prisoner. During this turmoil\r\nit is easy to imagine the condition of the community, terrorized by the\r\nInquisition. The majority of the people, we are told, favored the\r\nbishop, but were afraid of the absolute power exercised by the tribunal,\r\nwith the support of the governor. The better part of the clergy saved\r\nthemselves by flight and there was general demoralization. To render\r\ntheir victory complete the inquisitors assembled the chapter in order to\r\nhave the see declared vacant. All but two voted in the negative and left\r\nthe room, when the remaining two declared the vacancy and elected\r\nprovisors to govern the diocese.\r\n\r\nThen three vessels arrived from Spain which it was hoped would bring\r\ndespatches putting an end to the troubles. Nothing was given out as to\r\ntheir nature, but it was observed that each night the guard at the\r\nbishop’s palace was reduced until it was entirely withdrawn and\r\nBenavides was released after a confinement that had lasted from April 13\r\nto August 22, 1687. At the same time there arrived Gómez Suárez de\r\nFigueroa as inquisitor to replace Valera, who had been transferred to\r\nLima early in 1685 but who had awaited the arrival of his successor; he\r\nsailed September 2, 1687, reaching Panamá on the 23d and Lima in June,\r\n1688.\r\n\r\nSuárez at first seemed inclined to deprecate the excesses of his\r\npredecessor, but the traditions and interest of the Inquisition were too\r\nstrong and he soon yielded to them. The tribunal still held the bishop\r\nto be excommunicated. The news of the terrible earthquake of Lima, March\r\n9, 1687, improved by the preachers, caused a wave of religious fervor in\r\nwhich many persons abandoned their scandalous lives and applied to\r\nBenavides for licences to marry but, when the banns were published, the\r\ninquisitors excommunicated the officiating priests. They also gave\r\nnotice that all who communicated with the bishop must seek absolution at\r\ntheir hands--an absolution which they ostentatiously administered.\r\nSeeing them thus determined to carry on war to the knife, he resolved to\r\npublish a papal brief of January 15, 1687, which he had received. This\r\ntreated the matter as exclusively a quarrel between him and Valera; it\r\nrecognized fully the justice of his side and stated that the nuncio at\r\nMadrid had been ordered to prevail with the king that all his rights\r\nshould be restored to him and that he should have public satisfaction\r\nfor injuries endured. Although this brief had passed the Royal Council,\r\nwhen he applied to the civil authorities for aid in its publication this\r\nwas refused and when he circulated copies the inquisitors stigmatized it\r\nas a forgery. They filled their prison with the bishop’s supporters and\r\nthey garrotted in the plaza a Franciscan named Francisco Ramírez,\r\nwithout observing any formalities or even degrading him from holy\r\norders--a tragedy in which the governor, Francisco de Castro, acted the\r\npart of executioner.\r\n\r\nA new governor, Don Martin de Ceballos y la Cerda, brought with him a\r\nroyal cédula, ordering the restitution of the bishop to his full rights\r\nand jurisdiction. This was received with rejoicings, which showed how\r\nfew had been really opposed to him, although terrorism had forced men to\r\ndissemble. One article of the cédula, however, commanding the\r\nrestitution of all fines and confiscated property, was not obeyed,\r\nbecause the judge commissioned to enforce it belonged to the\r\ninquisitorial faction and had the support of Ceballos, with whom the\r\nbishop had speedily quarrelled. This encouraged the tribunal to a\r\nrenewal of molestation. When the bishop ordered the prosecution of\r\nDoctor Francisco Javier de Cárdenas, for abuses committed in a\r\nvisitation, the inquisitors threatened the provisor that, if he did not\r\nrelease Cárdenas, he should be imprisoned as the bishop had been. During\r\nthe troubles the tribunal had been conducted without the necessary\r\nconcurrence of an episcopal Ordinary. To remedy this, Benavides\r\nappointed Don José Pedro Medrano to act, but the inquisitors took away\r\nhis commission and refused to allow him to serve. Seeing that the\r\ncontest was endless, the bishop resolved to present himself at the court\r\nand embarked in an English vessel for London, but hearing in Jamaica of\r\nthe expulsion of James II, he returned to Cartagena to await the\r\narrival of the Spanish galleons. When they came, they brought a despatch\r\ncalling him to Madrid and he accompanied them on their return.\r\n\r\nAt this point the narrative in both Groot and Medina fails us and we\r\nknow nothing of his reception at court, except that it was not wholly to\r\nhis satisfaction. We learn from a consulta of the Council of Indies, in\r\n1696, that Innocent XI had rendered a decision invalidating the\r\nexcommunications uttered by the inquisitors and affirming those\r\nproclaimed by the bishop and that all comprised under the latter must\r\nobtain absolution. To do this would be so unexampled a humiliation that\r\nthe Suprema had not enforced it, and Benavides had, without asking the\r\nroyal permission, gone to Rome to accomplish its execution. This placed\r\nhim in antagonism with all Spanish traditions and, in 1695, the\r\nambassador was endeavoring to obtain papal authority to carry him back\r\nto Spain, but apparently without success, for in 1696 he was still\r\nthere. The indomitable old man died in Cádiz, but in what year is not\r\nknown and the see remained vacant until 1713.[822]\r\n\r\nHowever the Suprema may have interposed to prevent the humiliation of\r\nthe inquisitors, it set its seal of disapprobation on Valera. His\r\ntransfer to Lima indicates that it considered, early in the quarrel,\r\nthat his usefulness in Cartagena was ended. His action during the\r\ninterval between 1685 and 1688 evidently confirmed the unfavorable\r\nimpression and, as we have seen, he was met, on his arrival at Lima,\r\nwith orders from the Suprema to return to Spain--orders which he\r\nevaded--and in 1691 the Viceroy Moncada was instructed by the king to\r\nship him home. As this was merely a royal command, it received no\r\nattention, and he continued to exercise his functions; apparently he had\r\nprofited by experience for we hear of no controversies with either the\r\nspiritual or temporal power. With the advent of the Bourbon dynasty,\r\nhowever, there came a determination to curb inquisitorial exuberance and\r\nhis Cartagena performances were not forgotten. In 1703 there came\r\norders from both the king and inquisitor-general to jubilate him on half\r\nhis salary, the other half being applied to the Church of Cartagena, in\r\nconsideration of the controversy which he had with it, thus condemning\r\nhim to make to it such reparation as he could. The sentence came too\r\nlate, however, as he had died on August 2, 1702.[823]\r\n\r\nGovernor Ceballos had no reason to congratulate himself on siding with\r\nthe tribunal against Bishop Benavides. Its excesses had convinced the\r\ncourt that some thorough change was necessary if peace and harmony were\r\nto be restored in the colony and a Junta of two members each, of the\r\nSuprema and of the Council of Indies, was ordered to carry it into\r\neffect, but these intentions were balked by the members of the Suprema\r\nnever meeting their colleagues.[824] Nothing was done and the absence of\r\nthe bishop left the tribunal in absolute command of the city. How\r\ndespotically it exercised its authority is shown in a plaintive despatch\r\nof Governor Ceballos, January, 1693, reciting how the butcher of the\r\npublic shambles having refused to give the preference to a negro of\r\nInquisitor Suárez, the latter sent the gaoler of the secret prison to\r\nbring the butcher bound to the prison or, if he could not be found, then\r\none of the regidores of the city in his place. The butcher was found and\r\nthrown into the prison, where he was still lying. The governor says that\r\nhe was afraid to take the proper steps and contented himself with\r\naddressing a civil request to Suárez, which was disregarded. He found it\r\nimpossible to get legal evidence as to the affair, for witnesses were in\r\nsuch terror that they would make no formal depositions. On January 13th,\r\nafter drawing up a despatch on the subject, he went to his residence,\r\nwhither came Secretary Luna of the tribunal, accompanied by a mob of\r\nfollowers and, with much disturbance, required him under threat of major\r\nexcommunication and other censures to sign letters declaring that the\r\ncase belonged to the jurisdiction of the Inquisition and that he\r\nabandoned it; also that all references to the matter be erased from the\r\nbooks of the municipality and all the papers be delivered to the\r\ntribunal. In this strait he consulted with Don Francisco Gorrechategui,\r\nPresident of the Royal Audiencia of Santa Fe, and Don Fernando de la\r\nRiva Aguero, Judge of the Audiencia of Panamá, but they could render him\r\nno assistance; he was helpless and, for the sake of peace, he submitted\r\nto the demands of the Inquisition.[825] When such was the condition to\r\nwhich the tribunal had reduced the civil and military power in\r\nCartagena, we need no further explanation of the ease with which the\r\nFrench adventurers captured it in 1697.\r\n\r\nThat catastrophe, as we have seen, was the turning-point in the history\r\nof the tribunal, which thenceforth rapidly declined. In 1705, Pablo de\r\nOzaeta took possession as fiscal and found himself alone, in consequence\r\nof the severe illness of Inquisitor Lazaeta, until the arrival of Manuel\r\nde Verdeja y Cosio as his colleague. There was a lively quarrel on foot\r\nwith the governor, Juan Díaz Pimienta, to whom the tribunal had imputed\r\nthe concealment of the property of a person deceased. The two\r\nsecretaries, Echarri and Ventura de Urtecho, took his part and were\r\nexcommunicated and arrested, Urtecho being banished for eight years and\r\nEcharri ordered to leave the city within twenty-four hours, while his\r\nson was thrown into the secret prison. On the other hand, Pimienta\r\nseized Luis de Cabrera, the notary of sequestrations, and threw him into\r\nthe fort of Bocachica, where he died in the course of eight months, and,\r\non another occasion, acting on a royal order, he took, from Lazaeta’s\r\nhouse, Julian Antonio de Tejada, who had been sent out to report on the\r\ncapture. To avenge these insults, the tribunal commenced twenty-four\r\nprosecutions against the governor, but it was in no position to assert\r\nitself. In a letter of February 27, 1706, it exhaled its griefs. Ozaeta\r\nand Verdeja were ailing--one wanted to go to Spain and the other to be\r\ntransferred to Mexico. Everything was in ruin; the money coffer was\r\nempty; for ten years no galleons had arrived; Pimienta slighted Lazaeta\r\nat every turn, so that for eighteen months he had been obliged to shut\r\nhimself up in his house. As for Ozaeta, Verdeja, in a letter of\r\nSeptember 13th, accused him of devoting himself wholly to trade. He had\r\nbrought merchandise with him and was the agent of foreign merchants,\r\nwhose goods he introduced without paying duties, and there was no\r\nbusiness of this kind, throughout the extensive district of the\r\ntribunal, that was not under his control. He was allowed to enjoy this\r\nprofitable commerce until 1716, when he returned to Spain and was\r\nrewarded with an appointment to the tribunal of Llerena.[826]\r\n\r\nHe was replaced in Cartagena by Tomás Gutiérrez Escalante who did as\r\nlittle honor as his predecessor to the Holy Office, though he retained\r\nhis position until his death, in 1738. He was involved in bitter\r\nquarrels with the governor, Francisco Baloco, of which the details are\r\nlacking, though we may assume that he was in fault, for constant\r\ncomplaints of him were sent to the Suprema, and the Bishop Molleda y\r\nClerque (1734-41) accused him of interfering in matters beyond his\r\njurisdiction and that in his house there was nothing but banquets and\r\ngambling. One of these feasts was given in honor of the saint’s day of a\r\nyoung mulatto girl whom he kept and whom his guests had to honor.[827]\r\nAfter this we cease to hear of troubles with the civil authorities, but\r\nthe dissensions between the officials of the tribunal continued to the\r\nend of the century and the exhortations and commands of the Suprema were\r\nfruitless in maintaining harmony.[828]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe financial history of the tribunal, at least during the seventeenth\r\ncentury, is similar to that which we have already traced in Mexico and\r\nPeru. As we have seen, when Philip III established it in 1610 he was\r\ncareful to specify that the royal subvention of 8400 ducats was to\r\ncontinue only as long as the confiscations and fines and penalties were\r\ninsufficient; the receiver was ordered to furnish a yearly statement of\r\nhis receipts which were to be deducted from the payments to be made by\r\nthe treasury. Clearly as this program was laid out, it is perhaps\r\nneedless to say that it never received the slightest attention from the\r\ntribunal. It had not been long in operation when the fruits of its\r\nindustry began to pour in. A letter of July 22, 1621, conveyed the\r\npleasing information that it had secured the handsome sum of 149,000\r\npesos from the confiscated estate of the Judaizer Francisco Gómez de\r\nLeon.[829] Windfalls such as this were of course exceptional, but a more\r\nor less steady stream of smaller amounts can scarce have failed to\r\nreward its activity. Still this brought no relief to the royal treasury,\r\nwhich was regularly called upon for the subvention and, in 1630, we\r\nchance to hear of the complaints of the treasury officials, who were\r\nsummoned before the tribunal and scolded when they had not funds\r\nwherewith to meet the demands promptly.[830] In 1633 there duly came the\r\nsuppression of a canonry in every cathedral of the district for the\r\nbenefit of the tribunal--a measure designed for the relief of the royal\r\ntreasury--but the revenues of the prebends were quietly absorbed without\r\nrelaxing hold on the subvention.\r\n\r\nWealth flowed in with the discovery of Judaizers in 1636, whose\r\nconfiscations were announced in the auto de fe of March 25, 1638. That\r\nof Juan Rodriguez Mesa amounted to 65,000 pesos; that of Blas de Paz\r\nPinto to 50,000; of Francisco Rodríguez Pinto to 40,000, while the\r\nsmaller ones brought the aggregate up to 200,000, as reported, June,\r\n1638, by Andrés de Castro the receiver who assuredly did not exaggerate,\r\nand besides this there were confiscations in Havana amounting to\r\n150,000.[831] In 1639 there came orders to sell at auction three _varas_\r\nof alguaziles, one each in Santa Fe, Caracas and Popayan, but\r\ncompetition was not eager and we do not know the amount realized.[832]\r\nThe tribunal was evidently accumulating abundant capital, although it\r\nwas obliged to contribute a part of its gains to the Suprema. In 1644\r\nthe latter alludes to a remittance shortly expected from Cartagena of\r\nabout 10,000 ducats; by a letter of September 24, 1650, it appears that\r\nthe tribunal admitted to having on hand 187,677 pesos; according to a\r\ncertificate of June 30, 1659, there had been deposited in the money\r\ncoffer 430,414 pesos and, although there had been more than 100,000\r\nremitted to the Suprema, there was ample left. In addition there were\r\nhouses and lands; there were 95,332 invested in censos, yielding about\r\n4000 a year but the royal subvention was still regularly collected, the\r\n8400 ducats being reckoned at 11,500 pesos.[833]\r\n\r\nThe subvention continued to be paid though, with the increasing penury\r\nof the Spanish treasury, it was apt to be in arrears. In 1670 we find\r\nthe Suprema ordering the tribunal to use gentle methods; it learns that\r\nthe garrison is unpaid and therefore the fault may be with the governor;\r\nthe last payment collected was for the _tercio_ (four months) of\r\nNovember, 1668, and the annual amount alluded to is 8400 ducats. The\r\ntribunal was not satisfied and, in its replies of May 6 and October 8,\r\n1671, it asks for permission to apply pressure; the governor excuses\r\nhimself by the expenditures necessary to provide for the safety of the\r\nplace, but these pretexts will never be lacking, the civil salaries are\r\nregularly paid and the garrison is partially so. Yet the arrearage to\r\nthe tribunal had been diminished and was reduced to only three tercios,\r\nshowing that at least two years’ subvention had been collected during\r\nthe past twelvemonth.[834] Then the arrearage increased and on April 17,\r\n1674, the tribunal reported it at nearly eighteen months, whereupon the\r\nSuprema, February 3, 1675, addressed a strong remonstrance to the\r\nqueen-regent, threatening that if the officials were not paid regularly\r\nthey would be obliged to desert their posts; it recapitulated the\r\nfinancial history of the tribunal; the royal grant, in 1610, of 8400\r\nducats per annum, until the confiscations and fines and penances should\r\nsuffice, followed by the suppression of the prebends in 1633, and it had\r\nthe effrontery to assert that since then the prebends and fines and\r\npenances had been deducted from the subvention; the royal officials\r\nasserted that there were no moneys appropriated for the purpose, and\r\nthat they could not pay without special orders, wherefore the queen was\r\nasked to make the subvention a first charge on the treasury. Against\r\nthis the Council of Indies protested vigorously on March 9th, going over\r\nthe whole history of the matter and pointing out that whatever was paid\r\nto the Inquisition must be withdrawn from the protection of the coasts,\r\nravaged constantly by the buccaneers, and especially of Cartagena, which\r\nwas the object of their special cupidity. In fact, large expenditures\r\nwere made on the defences of the city, which was the entrepôt of the\r\nshipments of the precious metals to Spain; as the Council stated, the\r\nroyal treasuries of Santa Fe and Quito had already been drawn upon to\r\nthe amount of 17,390,300 mrs. for that purpose.[835]\r\n\r\nThe debate went on, without either side abandoning its position. The\r\nSuprema, on May 11, 1676, insisted that the subvention was a necessity\r\nfor the tribunal. Five of the canonries produced a total of only 2535\r\npesos and the sixth, of Puerto Rico, only about 100; the revenues from\r\ninvestments were 5491 pesos while the expenses were 18,770, so that even\r\nwith the subvention there was a deficit. It is evident that not much\r\nfaith was felt in these figures, for the Count of Peñaranda, in a\r\nconsulta of December 10, 1677, pointed out that there never had been any\r\nstatement furnished as to the amount of the confiscations and fines and\r\npenances, nor had any effort been made to obtain from Cartagena and\r\nPeru, as there had been from Mexico, restitution of the sums improperly\r\nobtained from the treasury, to which they were evidently large enough to\r\nafford sensible relief.[836]\r\n\r\nIn some Cartagena documents of 1684 we find the first evidence that the\r\ntreasury had the benefit of other receipts of the tribunal. On June 2d\r\nthe receiver presented to Inquisitor Valera a dolorous complaint as to\r\nthe financial condition. In the failure to collect the royal subvention\r\nit had been impossible to pay the salaries and other expenses without\r\ndrawing upon the funds held for creditors of confiscated estates\r\nawaiting settlement. The buildings of the Inquisition and its houses\r\nwere out of repair and threatening ruin; the last payment obtained from\r\nthe treasury was up to the end of October, 1678, since when there had\r\naccrued 61,764 pesos, 5 reales, 22 mrs. from which was to be deducted,\r\nof collections from the canonries, 8221 pesos, 3 quartellos, leaving a\r\nbalance due of 53,543 pesos, 4 reales, 31 mrs., which Valera was urged\r\nto collect in order that the fund held for creditors might be reimbursed\r\nand the necessary repairs made to the buildings. Thereupon Valera\r\naddressed to the governor, Don Juan Pando de Estrada, a vigorous appeal,\r\nembodying the receiver’s statement of the account and asking at least\r\nfor a partial payment. The governor submitted this to the treasury\r\nofficials, who admitted the correctness of the statement, and from their\r\nfigures it appears that in the settlements from November 1, 1675, to\r\nOctober 31, 1678, due allowance had been made for receipts from the\r\ncanonries--but they add that in 1680 a royal cédula had ordered the\r\narchbishop and bishops to report to them all payments to the tribunal on\r\naccount of the canonries, an order which had been obeyed only by the\r\nBishop of Cartagena. They professed the utmost desire to pay the\r\nInquisition and deplored their inability, in view of the demands of the\r\nhome government for remittances and the indispensable outlays for the\r\nmaintenance and safety of the city.\r\n\r\nThis the governor transmitted to the tribunal with the assurance of his\r\ndeep regret and a request for a statement of its other receipts, in\r\norder that an accurate balance could be reached. Valera met this last\r\ndemand by procuring from the receiver and his predecessor sworn\r\nstatements that nothing had been received from confiscations, fines and\r\npenances, the truth of which may be doubted in view of the receiver’s\r\nprevious complaint as to the use made of the sums in litigation with\r\ncreditors of confiscated penitents--but he added that, if there had been\r\nreceipts from these sources, they were especially appropriated to the\r\nsecret and necessary expenses of the Inquisition, which was a manifest\r\nfalsehood. Moreover, as the tribunal was a creditor of the treasury, and\r\nit appeared that there were no funds applicable to the discharge of the\r\ndebt, it had a right to have a detailed statement of receipts and\r\nexpenditures, to lay before the king, with a request for relief. What\r\nreply the governor made to this impudent demand, we have no means of\r\nknowing, but we may assume that the tribunal fared no better in the\r\nfuture. It had appealed, October 1, 1683, to the Suprema, setting forth\r\nits deplorable condition; as it was forbidden to use pressure, it was at\r\nthe mercy of the officials and it asked that the treasurers of Santa Fe\r\nand Quito be instructed to remit directly to its receiver. For some\r\nreason this appeal was not considered by the Suprema until April 10,\r\n1685, and then it was simply ordered to be filed away with the other\r\npapers.[837]\r\n\r\nWe may reasonably assume that much of the distress, thus movingly\r\nrepresented, was fictitious, to parry the demands of the Suprema for the\r\ncontributions which it was accustomed to exact. Notwithstanding the\r\nrecalcitrancy of the royal officials, the tribunal by diligent siege\r\nmanaged to extract an occasional payment and, though it unquestionably\r\nsuffered heavily at the capture of Cartagena, in 1697, what with the\r\nprebends and the occasional fortunate capture of a wealthy penitent, it\r\nwould seem not to have suffered from the lack of means. At least so the\r\nSuprema thought when, in a letter of June 15, 1705, it ordered the\r\ntribunal to be prompt in remitting the contribution demanded of it. Thus\r\nspurred, on February 27, 1706, it sent 6000 pesos, which it stated it\r\nhad been obliged to borrow, as it had no resources save to pledge\r\nrepayment out of the first moneys it should receive, and it expected to\r\ndo this out of the estate of Don Juan de Zavaleta, the settlement of\r\nwhich was hourly expected. It went on to give a dolorous account of its\r\ncondition. The capture of the city had left it in a miserable state--all\r\nthe money in its coffers was taken and all its buildings and houses were\r\ndamaged. Its chief means of support, it says, is the royal subvention,\r\nbut for six years it had failed to receive any important assistance from\r\nthis; arrearages due amount to more than 140,000 pesos and its\r\napplications to the treasury are met with enmity and ill-will. The\r\nsuppressed canonries produce less than 5000 pesos a year; as for the\r\nhouses, they have declined greatly in value; for more than ten years the\r\ngalleons have ceased to visit the port and commerce has so decreased\r\nthat the houses are generally untenanted and repairs consume most of the\r\nrentals received.[838]\r\n\r\nIn this sombre description there is doubtless a large element of truth.\r\nThe kingdom of New Granada, though less than two centuries old, was\r\nalready decaying and the Inquisition necessarily suffered with the rest\r\nof the community. Its poverty became so pressing that, in 1739, the\r\nhouses held by it were sold on ground-rents. To add to its misfortunes,\r\nas we have seen, in 1741, during the bombardment by Admiral Vernon, a\r\nbomb dismantled the Inquisition so that it had to be torn down and it\r\nwas not rebuilt until 1766. Still the tribunal managed to exist and\r\nwhen, in 1811, it was expelled from Cartagena, it had 4000 pesos in its\r\ncoffer.[839]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen came the Revolution the Inquisition evidently had lost all claim on\r\nthe respect of the people and was one of the early objects against which\r\npopular detestation was directed, rendering its career in those\r\nturbulent times different from that of its sister tribunals. Before\r\nHidalgo raised the banner of revolt, in September, 1810, already in July\r\ninsurrection had broken out in Santa Fe and, on August 13th, a\r\nrevolutionary Junta was established in Cartagena, although complete\r\nindependence of the Spanish crown was not yet contemplated. Matters\r\nremained for a year in this uncertain condition, during which the\r\ntribunal sought to ingratiate itself with the rising forces of\r\nRevolution by acquitting and discharging a patriotic priest, Juan A.\r\nEstévez sent to it by the Santa Fe Government to be imprisoned and\r\npunished for a sermon characterized as seditious; and it furthermore\r\ndismissed its commissioner, Doctor Lasso, who had started the\r\nprosecution--a service warmly recognized by the Supreme Junta in a\r\nmanifesto of September 25, 1810.[840]\r\n\r\nAs in Spain, the Liberals were careful to proclaim their adhesion to the\r\nprinciple of intolerance. The Constitution of Cádiz in 1812 declared\r\nthat the Catholic, Apostolic, Roman faith was the religion of the State\r\nand that no other worship, public or private, would be permitted, while\r\nthe Articles of Federation of the Provinces of New Granada enumerated\r\namong their duties that of maintaining the Catholic religion in its\r\npurity and integrity.[841] Yet when the Revolution culminated for the\r\ntime in Cartagena, November 11, 1811, by an armed rising of the people,\r\none of the demands made on the Junta was that the Inquisition be\r\nsuppressed and the inquisitors be handed their passports. The Junta was\r\nprompt in executing the popular wishes. The same day it issued a decree\r\nthat all who did not favor independence should leave the country within\r\neight days, and it summoned the various corporations to come forward and\r\ntake the oath of independence.[842] The next day, notice was sent to the\r\ntribunal that its existence was incompatible with the new order of\r\naffairs, and that the inquisitors, with such officials as desired to\r\nfollow them, must sail for Spain within fifteen days, while those who\r\nremained must forthwith take the oath; all papers were to be transferred\r\nto the bishops of the dioceses to which they referred and the property\r\nwas to be made over to the public treasury. To this the inquisitors\r\nreplied, on the following day, that the decision had been extorted by an\r\narmed mob and, as soon as popular agitation should subside, they\r\nexpected to resume the august functions confided to them by Divine\r\nProvidence. Insistence, however, brought compliance and, on November\r\n28th, they announced their readiness to go, though not to Spain; the\r\nauthorities took possession of all their property and the papers\r\nconnected therewith, but it was not until December 17th that their\r\npassports were sent, and further delays postponed their departure until\r\nJanuary 1, 1812, when they sailed for Santa Marta. There they erected\r\ntheir tribunal and remained for about a year, when the occupation of the\r\nplace by the revolutionary forces caused their transfer to Puertobelo.\r\nWhen Santa Marta was regained by the royalists they returned there and\r\nsoon afterwards they received news of the suppression of the Inquisition\r\nby the Córtes of Cádiz in February, 1813. This rendered their condition\r\nmore precarious than ever. In a report of July 8, 1815, they state that\r\non their ejection from Cartagena, they notified the various chapters to\r\npreserve the fruits of their prebends for them; those of Santiago de\r\nCuba, Havana and Panamá came regularly, but were paid into the royal\r\ntreasury; those of Puertobelo and Santo Domingo were held back through\r\nfear of pirates; that of Caracas by the revolution, so that they were in\r\narrears of their salaries by five tercios and had been living on\r\nborrowed money.[843] If their salaries were but twenty months in\r\narrears, in July, 1815, it indicates that the previous complaints of\r\npoverty had been exaggerated and it suggests that, in spite of the\r\nseizure of property, they had succeeded in carrying from Cartagena a\r\nfair supply of funds.\r\n\r\nThe triumph of the Spanish War of Independence and the restoration of\r\nFernando VII in the Spring of 1814 changed the face of affairs. The\r\nwhole power of the monarchy could be directed to the subjugation of the\r\nrevolted colonies and, in 1815, a heavy force was sent, under Don Pablo\r\nMorillo, to effect that of New Granada. Although the Inquisition had\r\nbeen revived in Spain by royal decree of July 21, 1814, it was not until\r\nMarch 31, 1815, that the joyful news reached Santa Marta, where the\r\ninquisitors celebrated it with a solemn mass and Te Deum and the\r\nannouncement that they resumed their duties, although, to keep up the\r\nsemblance of a tribunal, they had appointed as fiscal the alcaide of the\r\nsecret prison and as secretary the alcaide of the penitential prison.\r\nMorillo reached Santa Marta on July 24th and on August 15th he advanced\r\nto reduce Cartagena, accompanied by the senior inquisitor, José Oderiz,\r\nwhom he appointed as _teniente vicario general_ of his army. After a\r\nsiege of a hundred days, in which the inhabitants were almost destroyed\r\nby famine and pestilence, Cartagena fell on December 6th and Oderiz at\r\nonce took measures to seize prohibited books and resume his authority.\r\nThe other inquisitor, Prudencio de Castro, deferred the transfer of the\r\ntribunal until May, 1816, awaiting the restoration of sanitary\r\nconditions in the unhappy city, and it could not fully commence\r\noperations until January 21, 1817, the date at which the two\r\nsecretaries, who had remained behind, were reinstated in office, after\r\nundergoing the process of “purification,” to remove all taint of\r\nliberalism. Morillo himself had accepted the position of honorary\r\nalguazil.[844]\r\n\r\nOn April 29, 1818, there was a solemn publication of the Edict of Faith\r\nand of the Edict of Grace of the Suprema for heresies occasioned by the\r\nwar. This was followed in the afternoon by a procession through the\r\nstreets carrying the banner of the Inquisition; the standard-bearer was\r\nColonel Jiminez, accompanied by the principal officers of the army, to\r\nwhom the ceremonial was a farce, for we are told that they were nearly\r\nall Free-Masons.[845] It was not until near the end of the year,\r\nhowever, that the organization of the tribunal was completed, by the\r\narrival of the new fiscal, José Antonio de Aguirrezabal. Although thus\r\nready for business, it had little to do, in the disturbed condition of\r\nthe land, and it was in no condition to render active service. As it\r\nreported, September 25, 1819, it was suffering acutely from poverty,\r\nwithout means to repair its building which threatened ruin; it was\r\nunable to imprison offenders because they could not be fed; the salaries\r\nwere unpaid and the officials had no means of livelihood, for there were\r\nno charitable hands to solace their misery. In fact, its last case was\r\nthat of Don Rafael Barragan of Santa Fe, for propositions. His\r\naccusation dated back to 1813; after infinite trouble he was thrown into\r\nthe secret prison and, in September, 1818, his sentence was read in the\r\naudience chamber with closed doors; he abjured _de levi_ and was\r\nabsolved _ad cautelam_.[846]\r\n\r\nThe Revolution of 1820 in Spain revived the energies of the patriots who\r\nfelt that they had little to fear from further efforts of subjugation.\r\nThe suppression of the Inquisition by the royal decree of March 9, 1820,\r\nseems to have attracted little attention in New Granada and, if the\r\ntribunal continued to exist, it must have disappeared when Cartagena was\r\ncaptured by the revolutionists in October, 1821. Still, on September 3d\r\nof that year the Vice-president of the United States of Colombia, Doctor\r\nJosé María Castillo, deemed it necessary to issue a decree declaring the\r\nInquisition abolished. No traces of it should be allowed to exist and\r\ntherefore the authorities of Cundinamarca were ordered not to permit the\r\ncommissioner in Santa Fe to exercise his office. In future no\r\ninquisitorial edicts should be published, no books should be suppressed\r\nexcept by the Government and no ecclesiastical authority should\r\nsupervise their importation. As the commissioner at Santa Fe, Doctor\r\nSantiago Torres, had previously died in exile, the zeal of the\r\nvice-president was somewhat superfluous except in so far as the edict\r\ndeprived the bishops of censorship.[847]\r\n\r\nShortly after this the Congress of the United States of Colombia adopted\r\na law declaring the Inquisition extinguished forever and never to be\r\nre-established. All its properties were appropriated to the State. The\r\nbishops were restored to their ancient jurisdiction over matters of\r\nfaith, but appeal from their decisions lay to the civil courts. This\r\nhowever applied exclusively to Catholics. Foreigners of other faiths\r\nwere assured against molestation on account of religion, so long as they\r\nobserved due respect to the national one, and finally the civil power\r\nassumed to regulate the external discipline of the Church, such as the\r\nprohibition of books and similar matters.[848] As the United States of\r\nColombia then embraced the whole of the Spanish South American\r\npossessions, north of Peru, these liberal principles were effective over\r\na wide expanse of territory and, when the victory of Ayacucho, December\r\n10, 1824, finally destroyed the Spanish power in Peru and liberated the\r\ncolonies, the last chance disappeared that the reactionary government of\r\nSpain might attempt to revive the Inquisition.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMany causes contributed to the decay of the Spanish colonies, but among\r\nthem not the least was the impossibility of settled and orderly\r\nadministration occasioned by the multiplicity of rival jurisdictions,\r\ninherited from the medieval conceptions of the relations of Church and\r\nState. There were the military represented by the viceroy, and the civil\r\nby the Audiencia; the spiritual, exercised by the bishops over the\r\nsecular clergy; the numerous Regular Orders, exempt from the bishops and\r\nsubjected each to its own provincial; the Cruzada, whose numerous\r\nofficials owed obedience only to the Commissioner General or his\r\nrepresentative, and finally the Inquisition which claimed supremacy over\r\nall, in a sphere of action the limits of which it defined practically at\r\nits pleasure. Of these the most disturbing element was the Inquisition,\r\narmed with the irresistible weapon of excommunication, by which it could\r\nparalyze its antagonists at will, and the arbitrary power of arrest,\r\nwhich inspired general terror. We have seen what manner of men it was\r\nthat Spain habitually sent to the colonies to wield this irresponsible\r\nauthority, the use which they made of it and, when their abuse of it\r\nbecame unbearable, how they were rewarded by transfer to better\r\ntribunals or to episcopal seats. The commissioners whom they distributed\r\nthrough the provinces aped their masters and carried oppression and\r\ndiscord to every corner of the land, while the ægis of protection was\r\nextended over every criminal who could claim any connection, however\r\nillusory or fraudulent, with the tribunals.\r\n\r\nComplaints to the Council of Indies came pouring in by every fleet from\r\nbishops, governors, officials and individuals. These were duly laid\r\nbefore the king, who referred them to the Suprema; it would promise to\r\ncall for a report from the tribunals and this would be the last of the\r\nmatter, for however severely it might berate its subordinates in secret,\r\nit steadfastly defended them in public. In 1696 the Council submitted an\r\nelaborate consulta to Carlos II, recapitulating a number of flagrant\r\ncases, occurring from Mexico to Cumaná, and its fruitless efforts to\r\nobtain redress; it pointed out how completely the tribunals disregarded\r\nthe provisions of the Concordias and the impossibility of securing their\r\nobservance; it suggested various reforms, the most radical of which was\r\ndepriving the Inquisition of its temporal jurisdiction; it declared the\r\nmatter to be of greater importance than any other that could arise in\r\nthe monarchy, and it concluded with an earnest and eloquent appeal for\r\nimmediate action. The Inquisition, it said, was founding a supreme\r\nmonarchy, superior to all others in the State. It was regarded with\r\nuniversal hatred in all the regions of the Indies and with servile fear\r\nby all, from the lowest to the greatest.[849]\r\n\r\nOf course nothing was done and the condition of the colonies went on\r\nsteadily deteriorating. To this the Inquisition contributed not only as\r\na leading factor in internal misgovernment, but also by its hideous\r\nsystem under which the affluence of the tribunals depended upon the\r\nconfiscations which they could levy. We have seen how large a part this\r\nplayed in their financial vicissitudes and how it was regarded on all\r\nhands with eager expectation, and it is doing no injustice to the kind\r\nof men sent out as inquisitors to assume that it was a motive far more\r\npotent than the desire to maintain the faith with exact justice. To say\r\nnothing of the cruel wrongs inflicted on countless victims, commerce\r\ncould not flourish when the gains of the trader only served to render\r\nhim a tempting prey to such men, armed with irresponsible power\r\nexercised through the inquisitorial process and shielded from criticism\r\nby the secrecy of procedure and the stern punishment administered for\r\ncomplaint. The Suprema was constantly calling for remittances and, to\r\nsatisfy its exigencies and their own wants, there could be small\r\nhesitation in prosecuting any merchant whose success might excite\r\ncupidity, especially when trade was so largely in the hands of\r\ndescendants of New Christians. The benumbing effect of this on the\r\nwithering prosperity of the colonies is self-evident.\r\n\r\nHow it fared with New Granada, under all the various depressing\r\ninfluences of Spanish policy, is described in a report, made in 1772, by\r\nFrancisco Antonio Moreno y Escandon. The condition of the colony is\r\nrepresented as most deplorable and the tone of the report is that of\r\nutter hopelessness, in view of the universal decay and dilapidation. The\r\nlocal officials everywhere were indifferent and neglectful of duty; the\r\npeople steeped in poverty; trade almost extinct; capital lacking and no\r\nopportunities of its employment, for the only source of support was the\r\ncultivation of little patches of land and the mining of the precious\r\nmetals. There were no manufactures and no means of retaining money in\r\nthe country, for, though it was bountiful in products, it was unable to\r\ncultivate for export in consequence of the restrictions imposed by the\r\nhome Government; if freedom of export could be had for its cocoa,\r\ntobacco, precious woods, etc., it would flourish. The mines were still\r\nas rich as ever, but their product was greatly decreased; the province\r\nof Chico, which had large mineral wealth, was approachable by the river\r\nAtrato but, since 1730, the navigation of that stream was forbidden\r\nunder pain of death. It is true that, in 1772, Viceroy Mexia obtained\r\npermission to send two vessels a year up the river, but the permits for\r\nthis were held at a prohibitory price. The commerce with Spain consisted\r\nin one or two ships, with registered cargoes, annually from Cádiz to\r\nCartagena, whence the goods were conveyed into the interior, but so\r\nburdened with duties and expenses that there was no profit in the trade.\r\nIn the consequent absence of all industry every one sought to obtain\r\nsupport from the Government by procuring some little office. The\r\nfrontier territories were “Missions,” under charge of frailes, the\r\ndifferent Orders having charge of the various stations, while the\r\nGovernment defrayed the expenses and furnished guards of soldiers, which\r\nentailed heavy outlays with little result. They had all been established\r\nfor at least a century but had failed to advance the propagation of the\r\nfaith, for the Indians, when apparently converted and brought into\r\n_pueblos_ or villages, would run away and take to the mountains. This\r\nMoreno explains by the absence of the apostolic spirit on the part of\r\nthe missionaries, who undertook the career only to enjoy a life of ease\r\nand sloth.[850] The spirit of the secular clergy was even more\r\nreprehensible, if we may believe the relation drawn up by Viceroy Manuel\r\nde Guirior, in 1776, for the guidance of his successor. The deplorable\r\ncondition of the Church he ascribes to its subordinating its spiritual\r\nduties to the exaction of taxes and tithes, in illustration of which he\r\nstates that the parish priests omitted from their registers the records\r\nof marriages, baptisms and interments, in order to evade payment of the\r\nexcessive fees levied by the bishops on their official functions.[851]\r\nTo appreciate the full import of this we must bear in mind that on the\r\ncompleteness and accuracy of the parish registers depended the position\r\nin the community of every individual.\r\n\r\nThis degrading secularization of the Church was not confined to New\r\nGranada. When, in 1735, Don Jorje Juan and Don Antonio de Ulloa were\r\nsent to Quito, in company of the French men of science, to measure an\r\nequatorial degree of the earth’s surface, they were commissioned to\r\ninvestigate and report as to the condition of the colony in all its\r\nvarious aspects. The voluminous and detailed report which they\r\npresented, some ten years later, to the Marquis of la Ensenada, under\r\nFernando VI, gives a vivid picture of the disorders of clerical life.\r\nPublic prostitutes were scarce known in the cities, for licence and\r\nconcubinage were so universal that there was no call for professionals.\r\nDissolute as were the laity the clergy were worse, and of the clergy the\r\nregular Orders bore the palm for the effrontery of their scandalous mode\r\nof life--excepting, indeed, the Jesuits who are highly praised for their\r\nassiduity in their duties and the strictness with which the regulations\r\nof the Society were enforced, by the expulsion of all unworthy members.\r\nThe disorders of the others are attributed to their wealth and idleness.\r\nThe position of a provincial of any of the larger Orders, for the\r\nregular term of three years, was worth from 300,000 to 400,000 pesos,\r\nderived from the patronage of guardianships, priories, parish churches\r\nand plantations, which were distributed to those of his faction who\r\nwould pay proportionately for them--payments for which they recouped\r\nthemselves by grinding exactions on their parishioners and subjects. The\r\nconvents were dens of prostitution, occupied only by those who could not\r\nafford separate establishments. The wealthier ones lived in their own\r\nhouses with the concubines whom they changed at will and the children in\r\nwhom they took no shame, and these houses were the scenes of gambling,\r\ndancing and drinking, causing frequent scandalous disorders which the\r\npolice were unable to check, as the civil power had no jurisdiction over\r\nthe clergy. Notwithstanding this extravagance, their revenues were so\r\nlarge that all the best lands in the colony were rapidly passing into\r\ntheir possession, and this was especially the case with the Jesuits, who\r\nhusbanded their resources and managed their extensive properties with\r\nbusinesslike precision. What plantations were left to the laity were\r\nmostly burdened with heavy ground-rents and there was danger, if the\r\nprocess were not checked, that eventually the whole land would pass into\r\n_mainmorte_. As regards the missions, the report bears the same\r\ntestimony as we have seen in New Granada. With the exceptions of the\r\nJesuits, the Religious Orders, whose presence in the colony was based on\r\nthe pretext of spreading the faith, were too worldly and indolent to\r\ndevote themselves to that duty and the Jesuits were apt to find that\r\nwhen they sought to civilize their converts, these interesting\r\nneophytes would murder them and take to the mountains.[852]\r\n\r\nAll this frightful demoralization was beneath the attention of the\r\nInquisition. Its business was the salvation of souls by enforcing unity\r\nof faith, and its duties as to morals were confined to destroying such\r\nworks of art as it considered to be improper. Yet Ensenada, if he took\r\nthe trouble to read the report so laboriously prepared, might reasonably\r\nask himself whether a system which led to such results was fitted either\r\nfor the spiritual or the material benefit of the populations subjected\r\nto the Spanish monarchy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nKING FERDINAND TO THE SICILIAN INQUISITION, OCTOBER 25, 1512,\r\n\r\n(Archivo de Simancas, Inquisicion, Libro III, fol. 202).

tractados y proveidos y\r\ncurados en sus enfermedades.\r\n\r\nItem, la instruccion que manda que en la camara del secreto donde estan\r\nlas escrituras del crimen no entren sino solos los inquisidores y\r\noficiales del secreto so pena de excomunion.\r\n\r\nItem, la instruccion que manda que trabajen tres horas en la audiencia\r\nde mañana y otras tres à la tarde sobre lo qual se encarga la conciencia\r\nà los inquisidores para que asi lo hagan guardar y cumplir.\r\n\r\nItem, por quanto parece que la instruccion del arca que habla cerca del\r\ndepositarse el dinero confiscado que cobra el receptor no se guarda de\r\ndos ò tres años à esta parte y es cosa justa y necesaria que se guarde,\r\nmandamos que en todo caso sea guardada y cumplida so las penas en ella\r\ncontenidas.\r\n\r\nItem, que se guarden y cumplan de aqui adelante todas las otras\r\nInstrucciones del sancto oficio porque aquellas fueron hechas por los\r\nseñores inquisidores generales con mucho consejo y acuerdo de letrados y\r\nen generales congregaciones para el bien y observacion de las\r\ninquisiciones particulares y que para mejor observacion dellas se lean\r\naquellas dos veces en el año publicamente en el audiencia delante de\r\ntodos los oficiales, la una vez por pascua de resurrecion y la otra por\r\npascua de Navidad, y sobre esto encargamos las conciencias à los\r\ninquisidores.\r\n\r\nItem, por quanto parece por el dicho proceso de la visita que por el\r\nreceptor de los bienes confiscados se han vendido muchos esclavos\r\nreputados por cristianos que hobieron sido de condemnados ò\r\nreconciliados debiendo gozar de libertad y esto so color que no\r\nmostraban fé y testimonio de su conversion y bautismo, vos los\r\ninquisidores ò qualquiera de vos si asi es declarareis estos tales\r\nesclavos por libres y proveereis que sean puestos en libertad.\r\n\r\nItem, porque parece y somos informado que el inquisidor Melchior Cervera\r\nya defunto anduvo visitando por el reino y recibio muchas informaciones\r\ny testificaciones y es cosa justa y debida que aquellas se pongan en la\r\ncamara del secreto para que se haya entera noticia de las penas de los\r\nque quebraron las carcelerias y de los bienes confiscados y mal llevados\r\nal tiempo de la inventariacion de los bienes hecha por los comisarios y\r\nfactores y de otras cosas asi civiles como criminales, vos los dichos\r\ninquisidores ò qualquiera de vos proveereis que todas las dichas\r\ninformaciones y testificaciones se recojan y se pongan en la camara del\r\nsecreto, sino se hobiere ya cobrado para que se haya noticia de las\r\ndichas cosas y se provea en ello todo lo que fuere necesario y las que\r\npertenecieren al oficio del receptor se le entreguen en presencia y por\r\nante el escribano de sequestros.\r\n\r\nItem, por quanto parece que las provisiones y letras del inquisidor\r\ngeneral y del consejo que se embian à la dicha inquisicion no vienen\r\nalgunas veces al secretario ni se alcanza à saber lo que se envia à\r\nmandar sino por discurso de tiempo mandamos que todas las dichas\r\nprovisiones y cartas que hasta aqui se han despachado del inquisidor\r\ngeneral y del consejo y de aqui adelante se despacharan se pongan en la\r\ncamara del secreto para que de ellas se haya entera noticia y sean mejor\r\nguardadas y cumplidas.\r\n\r\nItem, por quanto parece que hay algunos condenados à pena de galeras y\r\notras penas las quales nunca se han ejecutado mandamos que vos los\r\ndichos inquisidores ò qualquiera de vos veais esto con diligencia y\r\nhagais justicia sobre lo qual os encargamos la conciencia.\r\n\r\nItem, por quanto somos informado quel notario de los sequestros ha\r\npedido muchas veces que se le de noticia de las penitencias impuestas y\r\nde las que dende en adelante se hobieren de imponer para tener cuenta y\r\nrazon dellas y hacer cargo al receptor ò à quien las habia recebido ò\r\nrecibiere y que nunca se ha hecho, mandamos que al escribano de\r\nsequestros se de noticia y razon de todas las penitencias pasadas.\r\n\r\nItem, mandamos que todas las penitencias que de aqui adelante se\r\nimpusieren se den al doctor Tristan Calvete el qual tenga razon de las\r\ndichas penitencias y mandamos à los inquisidores y à qualquiera dellos\r\nque pongan diligencia en cobrar las dichas penitencias y ponerlas en el\r\narca del sancto oficio conforme à la justicia.\r\n\r\nItem, porque parece que en la paga del quarto y quinto por las\r\nmanifestaciones de bienes ocultos ha habido y hay abuso por los\r\nreceptores no guardandose la provision que sobre esto està despachado,\r\nmandamos que aquella se guarde y que el dicho quarto y quinto no se\r\npague à los denunciantes sino solo de bienes ocultos y que no hayan\r\nvenido à noticia del receptor ni de otros oficiales de esa inquisicion y\r\nque los denunciantes no sean oficiales ò personas que por causa y razon\r\ndel oficio hayan sabido y manifestado los dichos bienes, y mandamos que\r\nde aqui adelante no se de por manifestacion de bienes ocultos salvo la\r\nquinta parte de los bienes que se cobraren por la tal manifestacion.\r\n\r\nItem, por quanto parece que el despensero de los presos tiene un mozo al\r\nqual se da de salario ocho tarines cada dia y de comer, vos los dichos\r\ninquisidores ò qualquiera de vos proveereis en esto lo que convenga de\r\nmanera que no traya gastos superfluos.\r\n\r\nItem, por quanto somos informado que el escribano de sequestros anduvo\r\ncon el inquisidor Cervera en la visita de ese reino catorce meses fuera\r\nde la ciudad de Palermo y que en ese tiempo se han vendido muchos bienes\r\ny cobrado muchas deudas en la dicha ciudad y que no ha podido hallar\r\nrazon cuenta de lo que se ha entrado y cobrado, mandamos que vos los\r\ndichos inquisidores ò qualquiera de vos averigueis brevemente con\r\ndiligencia esto dando todo el favor que fuere menester al contador y\r\nescribano de sequestros.\r\n\r\nItem, porque somos informado que en ese oficio se hacen muchos gastos\r\nque se podrian muy bien escusar y que los inquisidores dan los\r\nmandamientos para ello con mucha facilidad y es cosa justa y debida se\r\nprovea esto, mandamos que vos los inquisidores ò qualquiera de vos os\r\ninformeis destos gastos extraordinarios y proveais que de aqui adelante\r\nno se hagan gastos superfluos.\r\n\r\nItem, porque parece que los presos de la carcel estan alguna vez mal\r\nproveidos de ropa de cama porque à los que son fuera de la ciudad no les\r\ncuran de traer ropa y que seria bien que cuando el alguacil trae algun\r\npreso trugese ropa con èl de sus bienes para su cama, vos los dichos\r\ninquisidores ò qualquiera de vos provereis esto de manera que los presos\r\nsean bien proveidos y tratados.\r\n\r\nItem, mandamos que los familiares deste santo oficio sean personas\r\nvirtuosas, quietas, pacificas y abonadas y que el numero no sea\r\nsuperfluo porque no haya justa causa de quejas que lo mesmo està\r\nproveido en las otras inquisiciones.\r\n\r\nItem, porque parece que por los notarios del secreto se han examinado\r\nalgunos testigos del crimen sin presencia de los inquisidores ò de\r\nalguno dellos contra el tenor de la instruccion que esto prohibe\r\nmandamos que la dicha instruccion se guarde como en ella se contiene\r\nsobre lo qual encargamos la conciencia à los inquisidores y notarios del\r\nsecreto salvo que fuere dificultoso ir alguno de los inquisidores à\r\nhacer el dicho examen en el qual caso el comisario juntamente con uno de\r\nlos dichos notarios lo pueda hacer el qual comisario entonce de\r\ncertificacion de la fe que se debe dar à los testigos que asi se\r\nexaminaren.\r\n\r\nItem, porque consta por el proceso de la dicha visita que à los\r\noficiales y ministros dese sancto oficio le han hecho algunas\r\nresistencias è injurias las quales no han sido castigadas mandamos que\r\nel fiscal haga acerca desto sus instancias debidas y vos los\r\ninquisidores ò qualquiera de vos hagais justicia porque à los\r\nmalhechores sea castigo y à los otros exemplo y los oficiales de aqui\r\nadelante no sean injuriados ni maltratados.\r\n\r\nItem, por quanto parece que algunas veces los inquisidores no entienden\r\npersonalmente en la ratificacion de los testigos y los comisarios no\r\nguardan el secreto mandamos que la ratificacion de los testigos se haga\r\nante vos los inquisidores ò qualquiera de vos y que se guarde\r\nenteramente la instruccion que cerca desto habla ansi en el examen\r\nsumario como en las ratificaciones.\r\n\r\nItem, porque parece que algunos llamandose comisarios sin tener comision\r\nni poder del receptor han exigido y cobrado deudas debidas al fisco real\r\nen muchas partes asi en tiempo del receptor Obregon como de Garcia Cid y\r\naunque algunos dellos vinieron à dar cuenta à los receptores otros no la\r\nhan dado, mandamos que el inquisidor contador y escribano de sequestros\r\nque agora van proveidos averiguen esto con mucha diligencia y en todo\r\nprovean mediante justicia.\r\n\r\nItem, parece que al tiempo que vino en ese reino el ambajador moro de\r\nlos Gelves el inquisidor Calvete hizo traer à la inquisicion un\r\nesclavito pequeño que los moros que vinieron con el dicho embajador le\r\ntenian hurtado para se lo volver en Berberia porque no le llevasen à\r\npedimiento del dueño y tambien porque el mochacho diz que decia que\r\nqueria ser cristiano y que ido deste reino el dicho ambajador entrego el\r\ndicho esclavito al fiscal de ese reino y no à la parte cuyo era aunque\r\nlo vino à pedir diversas vices. Porende mandamos que vos los dichos\r\ninquisidores ó qualquiera de vos proveais en esto lo que fuere de\r\njusticia de manera que el dicho esclavo se vuelva y de y entregue à cuyo\r\nes.\r\n\r\nItem, parece que por parte de un Francisco Maynente preso por herege se\r\nhobo allegado para su defensa que los testigos fueron conspirados y\r\nconjurados contra èl por un Juan de Avisa y otros consortes suyos para\r\nlo qual nombro testigos y allende aquellos pidio que tambien se\r\nexaminasen los nombrados por sus hijos y que yendo à entender uno de los\r\ninquisidores en la probanza desta conspiracion recibio en contradiccion\r\ndel fiscal testigos nuevamento nombrados por los hijos è yernos del\r\npreso ò à un suegro suyo è à otros que continuamente con las armas en\r\nlas manos han andado en defension del dicho Francisco Mainente, y que\r\nen el examen los susodichos no fueron preguntados de deudos amistad ni\r\nde otras circumstancias necesarias de lugar y tiempo de manera que por\r\nesta via se ha embarazado esta causa y tornandose à desdecir algunos de\r\nlos testigos. Porende mandamos que el fiscal haga sus pedimentos cerca\r\ndesto ante los inquisidores y que ellos ò qualquiera dellos provean lo\r\nque fuere de justicia.\r\n\r\nItem, por quanto parece que los reconciliados traen los habitos\r\ncubiertos por los ciudades y tierras donde moran, los inhabiles per\r\ncondemnacion de padres y de abuelos traen armas, seda, oro, plata y usan\r\nde cosas que les son vedadas y prohibidas y que esto no se castiga y es\r\nen mucho deservicio de Dios y menosprecio de justicia mandamos que el\r\nfiscal haga sus pedimentos sobre esto y los inquisidores ò qualquiera\r\ndellos lo castiguen y provean mediante justicia.\r\n\r\nItem, porque parece que el receptor se queja que el inquisidor Cervera\r\nen la visita que hizo por ese reino mando acudir con los aquileres de\r\nuna casa à un Nadal Valaguer contra toda justicia y razon, la qual casa\r\ncon otras bienes diz que estaban cedidos y traspasados à ese santo\r\noficio por alcances que se ovieron hecho al dicho Nadal de haciendas\r\ncobradas en su tiempo y del receptor Obregon, mandamos que vos los\r\ninquisidores ò qualquiera de vos hagais brevemente justicia.\r\n\r\nItem, porque parece que ha habido comunicacion de presos unos con otros\r\npor la mala guarda de las carceles y desto se siguen muchos\r\ninconvenientes al sancto oficio, mandamos que los inquisidores ò\r\nqualquiera de vos proveais cerca desto de remedio convenible.\r\n\r\nItem, por quanto parece que al tiempo de la conmocion de ese reino\r\nmuchos de los reconciliados por ese sancto oficio se quitaron los\r\nhabitos penitenciales y despues aca no se los han vuelto los quales en\r\nmucho deservicio de Dios y grande daño de las animas de los dichos\r\nreconciliados, mandamos que vos los dichos inquisidores ò qualquiera de\r\nvos proveais que todos los dichos habitos se vuelvan à los dichos\r\nreconciliados para que los trayan publicamente y cumplan las sentencias\r\nque contra ellos fueron dadas mirando mucho que esto se haga en tiempo y\r\nde manera que por ello no se pueda seguir escandalo ni inconveniente\r\nalguno, que despues de vueltos se usara con los que cumplieren como\r\ndeben sus penitencias de misericordia.\r\n\r\nItem, por quanto parece que los inquisidores y otros oficiales de esa\r\ninquisicion han llevado algunos presentes contra la instruccion que esto\r\nprohibe, mandamos que de aqui adelante se guarde la dicha instruccion\r\ncomo en ella se contiene y lo que se ha llevado hasta aqui de presentes\r\ncontra la dicha instruccion de confesos y litigantes se ha restituido à\r\nlas partes que dieron los dichos presentes.\r\n\r\nItem, porque somos informado que el inquisidor Melchior Cervera por\r\ndescargo de su conciencia dejo en su ultimo testamento à ese santo\r\noficio docientos ducados de oro, y es cosa justa que se cobren, mandamos\r\nque el receptor de los bienes confiscados no pague à el heredero del\r\ndicho Melchior Cervera de lo que se le debiere de su salario los dichos\r\ndocientos ducados y si todo su salario fuese pagado se cobren por el\r\ndicho receptor ò contador de los bienes del dicho inquisidor Cervera.\r\n\r\nPor ende mandamos à vos los dichos inquisidores y oficiales que agora\r\nsois ò por tiempo fueredes en el oficio de la santa inquisicion del\r\ndicho reino de Sicilia que veades las instrucciones y ordinaciones y\r\ncosas y capitulos susodichos y todas las otras instrucciones del dicho\r\nsancto oficio y cada uno de vos en lo que toca y atañe las guardeis y\r\ncumplais y hagais guardar y cumplir en todo y por todo segun que en\r\nellas se contiene y contra el tenor y forma de lo en ellas y cada una\r\ndellas contenido no vayais ni paseis ni consintais ir ni pasar en tiempo\r\nalguno so las penas en los dichos capitulos é instrucciones contenidas\r\nsobre todo lo qual vos encargamos la conciencia, en testimonio de lo\r\nqual mandamos hacer la presente firmada de nuestro nombre refrendada del\r\nsecretario y sellada con el sello deste sancto oficio.\r\n\r\nDatum en la villa de Madrid à xxxi dias del mes de Enero del año del\r\nnascimiento de nuestro señor mil quinientos y veinte y cinco\r\n\r\n_Archiepiscopus Hispalensis_.\r\n\r\nDe mandato Rmi.

(See p. 87).\r\n\r\n_Relazione fatta dal P. D. Paolo d’Arezzo alla Città di Napoli nel suo\r\nritorno._\r\n\r\nQuel che S. M. nell’espedirmi da lei mi comandò à me D. Paolo d’Arezzo,\r\nche Io dovessi far fede alla sua Fed^{ma} Città di Napoli della buona\r\nvoluntà sua verso della Città e di tutto quel suo Regno di Napoli é come\r\ntutti l’ama grandemente e desidera ogni loro sodisfazione e la M. S. è\r\npronta farli sempre nuove grazie e nuovi beneficii et in ogni occasione\r\ndimostrar l’amore e benignità sua, e la gratitudine dell’ animo suo per\r\nla fedeltà la quale sempre hanno usata verso la M. S. e de suoi\r\npredecessori e per li continui e grandi servizii tanto in guerra quanto\r\nin pace, delli quali S. M. ne tiene memoria, aggradendoli e tenendoli in\r\nquel conto che si deve. E per quanto al particolare delle grazie che si\r\nhanno a S. M. domandate, quel che ha conosciuto esser utile benefizio e\r\nquiete della Città e Regno di Napoli di liberarli per sempre\r\ndall’Inquisizione ce l’ha concesso molto liberamente e benignamente,\r\nsperando che si portaranno piamente e cristianamente nelle cose della\r\nReligione e della S. Fede Catt^{ca} e cosi l’esorta tutti ad averne\r\nbuona cura e diligenza. Ma in quanto a gli altri capi perche S. M. non\r\nvede che siano in beneficio loro, anzi potriano essere à loro stessi\r\ndannosi non l’ha parso poterli concedere in buona coscienza, ne però\r\nl’exclude del tutto ma si reserba ed averà buona e più matura\r\nconsiderazione e provederli più di spazio. Mi commise ancora ch’Io lo\r\nriferissi come desidera venire in questa città à visitare il Regno per\r\nmostrare à tutti l’amore e buona volontà che li porta, e così come in\r\nabsenza ha conosciuto la fedeltà ed affezione di tutti per sua maggior\r\nconsolazione e contento fruirla con la presenza e dal canto suo ancora\r\ndar tutta quella sodizfazione che può a così fedeli ed amorevoli\r\nvassalli, il che S. M. tiene intenzione di farlo colla prima occasione\r\nche dio benedetto gli darà.\r\n\r\nQuesto è quel tanto che S. M. mi comandò che da sua parte io dovesse\r\nriferire alla Città in testimonio ed esplicazione della benignità ed\r\namor suo verso di questa Città e Regno di Napoli tutto il sopradetto\r\nl’ho visto con gli occhi e toccato con mano esser la pura verità.\r\n\r\n\r\nEL REY.\r\n\r\nPor quanto haviendose nos suplicado por parte de la nuestra ciudad y\r\nRegno de Napoles fuesemos servido declarar nuestra intencion cerca las\r\ncosas de heresia que alli succediere. Por ende por tenor de la presente\r\ndeximos y declaramos no haver sido ni ser de nuestra mente ò intencion\r\nque en la dicha ciudad y Reyno se ponga la Inquisicion en la forma de\r\nEspaña, sino que se proceda por la via ordinaria como esta aqui, y que\r\nassi se observara y complira con efecto en lo adelante, sin que en ello\r\nhaya falta, en testimonio de lo qual mandamos dar la presente firmada de\r\nnuestra mano y sellado con nuestro sello secreto.

MEXICO, JANUARY 26, 1817.\r\n\r\n(From an original in my possession).\r\n\r\n(See pp. 275, 281).\r\n\r\n     Nos los Inquisidores Apostolicos, contra la heretica Pravedad, y\r\n     Apostasía en la Ciudad de México, Estados, y Provincias de esta\r\n     Nueva España, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Islas Filipinas, sus Distritos,\r\n     y Jurisdicciones, por Autoridad Apostolica, Real, y Ordinaria, &c.\r\n\r\nA todas, y qualesquiera personas de qualquier Estado, grado, y\r\ncondicion, preeminencia, ó dignidad que sean, exêntos, ó no exêntos,\r\nvecinos, y moradores, estantes, y habitantes en las Ciudades, Villas, y\r\nLugares de este nuestro distrito, y á cada uno de Vos, Salud en nuestro\r\nSeñor Jesucristo, que es verdadera salud, y á los nuestros mandamientos\r\nfirmemente obedecer, y cumplir.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSABED: Que ha llegado á nuestras manos una Proclama del rebelde Cura de\r\nDolores, que se titula: “Manifiesto, que el Señor Don Miguel Hidalgo, y\r\nCostilla::::” haze al Pueblo, y empieza: “Me veo en la triste necesidad\r\nde satisfacer á las gentes; _y acaba_, sobre este basto Continente.” Sin\r\nlugar de impresion; pero sin duda la imprimió en Guadalaxara, y la\r\npublicó manuscrita en Valladolid en todas las Iglesias, y Conventos, aun\r\nde Monjas, despues de la derrota, que sufrió por las armas del Rey en\r\nAculco. En ella vuelve á cubrirse con el velo de la vil hipocresia,\r\nprotestando, que jamás se há apartado de la fé Católica, y pone por\r\ntestigos á sus Feligreses de Dolores, y San Felipe, y al Exército, que\r\ncomanda: testigos que para el Pueblo fiel, deben hacer la misma fé, que\r\nlos ciegos citados para juzgar de los colores “¿Pero para qué, testigos,\r\n_prosigue en su capciosa Proclama_, sobre un hecho, é imputacion, que\r\nella misma manifiesta su falsedad? Se me acusa, de que niego el\r\ninfierno, y de que asiento, que algun Pontifice de los Canonizados está\r\nen este lugar; ¿como se puede concordar, que un Pontifice esté en el\r\ninfierno, y negar al mismo tiempo su exîstencia? Se me imputa, que sigo\r\nlos perversos Dogmas de Lutero, al mismo tiempo, que se me acusa, que\r\nniego la autenticidad de los Santos Libros: ¿Si Lutero deduce sus\r\nerrores de estos mismos Libros, que cree inspirados por Dios, como he de\r\nser Luterano si niego la autenticidad de estos Libros? ¿Os\r\npersuadiriais, Américanos, que un Tribunal tan respetable, y cuyo\r\ninstituto es el mas Santo, se dexase arrastrar del amor al Paisanage,\r\nhasta prostituir su honor, y reputacion?” Mucho le escuece á este impío,\r\nque el Santo Oficio le haya manifestado en su propia figura á todo el\r\nReyno, que por su fidelidad, y catolicismo llena de maldiciones á un\r\nmonstruo, que abrigaba sin conocerle: pero quando copia para instruccion\r\npublica sus errores, no omite la contradiccion manifiesta entre ellos\r\nmismos; porque este es el caracter, y propiedad de todos los hereges,\r\nmientras no bajan à el último grado en la escala del precipicio, que es\r\nel Ateismo, y Materialismo, como le ha sucedido á éste impío; y así la\r\ncontradiccion será suya, y respectiva á aquellos tiempos, en que fue\r\nLuterano, comparados, ó contrahidos con los de su decidido Ateismo, y\r\nMaterialismo, como se manifestará en la lectura publica de su causa\r\nfenecidos los terminos, que deben seguirse para condenarle en rebeldia.\r\nSatisfaccion, que no dá este Tribunal á su Manifiesto por que la\r\nmerezca, síno para que este sofisma no alucine á los incautos, y vuelvan\r\nsobre sí los que hayan llegado á debilitar su opínion en favor del Santo\r\nOficio, persuadiendose á que es capáz éste antemural de la Religion, y\r\ndel Estado de valerse de la impostura, como quiere persuadir este\r\nHipocrita, para degradar su opinion, y quitar por este medio, indigno de\r\nnuestra probidad y caracter Sacerdotal, la energia á su voz rebelde, y\r\nsediciosa, y para que conozcan de una vez, y teman todos los habitantes\r\nde este Reyno la justicia de Dios por los pecados públicos, empezada á\r\nmanifestar en este azote, que han sufrido las Provincias, que este Atéo\r\ncruel, y deshonesto ha infestado con sus consejos, alucinando á tantos\r\nmiserables, que ha hecho victimas del proyecto de trastonar el Trono, y\r\nla Religion, y declarandose el mas feroz enemigo de los que llama sus\r\nconciudadanos; pues parece que no quiere mas vidas que la suya\r\nponiendola en salvo con la fuga, y mirando con frialdad inaudita la\r\nmortandad de millares de infelices en las Cruces, en Aculco, Guanaxuato,\r\nZamora, y Puente de Calderon. Obstinacion caracteristica de un Atéo, que\r\nno conoce, que el poder de Dios ha roto su arco tantas veces con una\r\nespecie de prodigio visible respecto de los pocos fieles, que han\r\nperecido.\r\n\r\nSon igualmente sediciosas y sanguinarias dos proclamas manuscritas; la\r\nuna empieza _Hemos llegado á la época_; y acaba: _De un Patriota de\r\nLagos_: La otra empieza, _¡Es posible Americanos!_ y acaba: _será\r\ngratíficado con quinientos pesos_. El objeto de ambas es el mismo que la\r\ndel rebelde Hidalgo; y con ella se han quemado publicamente de orden del\r\nsuperior Gobierno por mano de Berdugo en la Plaza pública, y se han\r\nprohibido baxo de la pena de alta traicion por Bando publicado por el\r\nExcelentisimo Señor Virey de este Reyno, que ha excitado nuestro zelo\r\npara arrancarlas con las censuras correspondientes de vuestras manos. No\r\nnecesitaban en realidad de especial prohibicion por estár comprendidas\r\nespecificamente en nuestros anteriores Edictos particularmente en el de\r\ncitacion en rebeldia al infame Hidalgo, publicado en trece de Octubre\r\ndel año pasado como lo està igualmente el Bando que publicó el\r\nLicenciado Don Ignacio Antonio Rayon, su fecha en Tlalpujagua á 24 de\r\nOctubre proximo, en que convoca á todo Americano á la sedicion, llamando\r\ncausa santa, justa, y religiosa esta escandalosa, atróz, y sanguinaria\r\nrebelion, proscribiendo á los Europeos, confiscando sus bienes, y dando\r\nnueva forma á la recaudacion de impuestos. En dicho Edicto de 13 de\r\nOctubre declaramos incursos en la pena de Excomunion mayor, de\r\nquinientos pesos, y en el crimen de fautoria sin excepcion á quantas\r\npersonas aprueben la sedicion de Hidalgo, reciban sus Proclamas,\r\nmantengan su trato, y correspondencia, y le presten qualquiera genero de\r\nayuda, ó favor, y á los que no denuncien, y obliguen á denunciar, á los\r\nque favorezcan sus ideas revolucionarias, y de qualquier modo las\r\npromuevan, y propaguen. En nuestro Edicto de 28 de Septiembre ultimo\r\nprohibimos baxo de las mismas penas qualquiera proclama, ya fuese del\r\nintruso Rey José, ó ya de qualquiera otro Español, ó Estrangero que\r\ninspirase desobediencia, independencia, y trastorno del Gobierno,\r\nrenovando la fuerza de la regla 16 del Indice Expurgatorio, y de\r\nnuestros Edictos de 13 de Marzo de 1790, 27 de Agosto de 1808, 22 de\r\nAbril, y 16 de Junio de 1810: lo que se os hace presente por última y\r\nperentoria vez para quitaros las escusas, de que por nuevos no estais\r\nobligados á la denuncia, corriendo semejantes papeles incendiarios\r\nimpunemente de mano en mano con peligro de la Patria, y de la Religion\r\nhasta que algun zeloso católico, y fiel vasallo los denuncia.\r\n\r\n     Y para la mas exâcta obserbancia, y cumplimiento de lo contenido en\r\n     el Edicto General de Fé, en los anteriormente citados, y de los\r\n     respetables encargos del Gobierno: Por el tenor del presente os\r\n     exhôrtamos, requerimos y mandamos en virtud de Santa Obediencia, y\r\n     só la pena de Excomunion mayor _latæ sentenciæ_, y pecuniaria á\r\n     nuestro arbitrio, que desde el dia, que este nuestro Edicto fuere\r\n     leido, y publicado ó de él supieredes de qualquiera manera, hasta\r\n     seis dias siguientes (los quales os damos por tres terminos, y el\r\n     ultimo perentorio) trahigais, exhibais, y presenteis las\r\n     sobredichas Proclamas, y Bando, y qualquiera otro Papel sedicioso\r\n     impreso, ó manuscrito, ante Nos, ó ante los Comisarios del Santo\r\n     Oficio fuera de esta Corte, denunciando à los que los tubieren, y\r\n     ocultaren, y á las personas, que propaguen con proposiciones\r\n     sediciosas, y seductivas el espiritu de Independencia, y Sedicion.\r\n     En testimonio de lo qual mandamos dar, y dimos esta nuestra Carta\r\n     firmada de nuestros nombres, sellada con el Sello del Santo Oficio,\r\n     y refrendada de uno de los Secretarios del secreto de él.

Que\r\nse declara al precitado presbitero José María Morelos, confitente\r\ndiminuto malicioso y pertinaz: que se le declara herege formal negativo,\r\ndespreciador, perturbador y perseguidor de la gerarquía eclesiastica,\r\natentador y profanador de los santos sacramentos. Que es reo de Lesa\r\nMagestad Divina y Humana, Pontificia y Real y que asista al auto en\r\nforma de penitente inter misarum solemnia, con sotana corta, sin cuella\r\nni ceñidor y con vela verde en su mano que ofrecera al sacerdote,\r\nconcluida la misa, como tal herege y fautor de hereges desde que empezó\r\nla insurreccion, y como á enemigo cruel del Santo Oficio se le confiscan\r\nsus bienes con aplicacion á la Real camara y fisco de S. M. en los\r\nterminos que declarara el Tribunal y aunque merecedor de la degradacion\r\ny relajacion por los delitos cometidos del fuero y conocimiento del\r\nSanto Oficio, sin embargo por estar pronto á abjurar sus crasos y\r\ninveterados errores, se le condena, en el remoto é inesperado caso de\r\nque se le perdone la vida por el Excmo. Señor Virrey, Capitan General de\r\nesta Nueva España, á destierro perpetuo de ambas Americas, corte de\r\nMadrid y sitios reales, y á reclusion en carcel perpetua en uno de los\r\nPresidios de Africa, á disposicion del Excmo. é Ilustrisimo Señor\r\nInquisidor General, se le depone de todo oficio y beneficio eclesiastico\r\ncon inavilidad é irregularidad perpetua. Que á sus tres hijos aunque\r\nsacrilegos se les declara incursos en las penas de infamia y demás que\r\nimponen los canones y leyes á los descendientes de hereges, con arreglo\r\ná las instrucciones de este Santo Oficio. Que abjure de formali y sea\r\nabsuelto de las excomuniones y censuras en que ha incurrido reservadas\r\nal Santo Oficio. Que haga una confesion general y sin omitir el Oficio\r\nDivino, rece los siete Psalmos Penitenciales los Viernes, y los Sabados\r\nuna parte del Rosario durante su vida. Y que se fige su nombre, patria,\r\nreligion y delitos en la Santa Iglesia Catedral de esta corte. Asi lo\r\nacordaron mandaron y firmaron.

Fernando de Torres y Portugal Conde\r\ndel Villar, digo: que à mi noticia es venido que en este Santo Oficio se\r\nha declarado por V. Sª que yo incurrì en ciertas Censuras de Excomunion\r\npor haber procedido criminalmente contra el Dr. Diego de Salinas y otras\r\ncausas, y aunque à lo que puedo entender he tenido siempre seguridad y\r\nquietud de mi conciencia de no haber incurrido en ellas por no haber\r\nsido de mi intencion en ninguna de las causas que se han ofrecido hacer\r\ncosas por donde yo entendiese caia en la tal excomunion, creyendo que\r\npara proceder en los negocios y cosas sucedidas me competia derecho por\r\nrazon de mi oficio y cargo y otras consideraciones. Pero entendido ahora\r\nque por V. Sª se ha declarado haber incurrido en la dicha excomunion,\r\nacudo à este Santo Oficio como obediente hijo de nuestra Santa Madre\r\nIglesia para que V. Sª me de la absolucion, la cual pido y suplico se me\r\nconceda por aquella via y forma que hubiere lugar de derecho y mas y\r\nmejor convenga à la seguridad de mi conciencia que es justo yo tenga en\r\ntodo tiempo, en especial habiendome de embarcar para España como con\r\nlisencia y por mandado del Rey nuestro Señor estoy para lo hacer con\r\nmucha brevedad.--El Virrey Conde del Villar.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEn la Ciudad de los Reyes à 14 de Octubre de 1589 los Inquisidores Dr.\r\nJuan Ruiz de Prado y Lisenciado Antonio Gutierrez de Ulloa estando en su\r\nAudiencia de la tarde, habiendo visto esta dicha peticion dijeron que\r\nper cuanto por su parte de los dichos Ynquisidores se habia advertido\r\ndiversas veces, asi por terceras personas como por escrito à su Sª del\r\ndicho S^{r} Virrey Conde del Villar que por las cosas que habia hecho\r\ncontra el Santo Oficio y sus Ministros habia incurrido en las Censuras\r\ncontenidas en el motupropio de nuestro muy Santo Padre Pio quinto y\r\nestaba excomulgado, y que el haber incurrido en ellas y en otras es tan\r\nclaro que aunque no se hubiera advertido, estaba obligado à lo entender\r\nasi, porque todos entienden que incurren en ellas las personas que ponen\r\nimpedimento directo ò indirecto al ejercicio del Santo Oficio de la\r\nYnquisicion y su Libertad, y tratan mal con obras ò palabras de los\r\nYnquisidores ù otros ministros de ella, en derogacion de su reputacion y\r\nautoridad, sin que en esto escuse ni pueda escusar la intencion por\r\nbuena que sea, porque clara cosa es que no se atiende para incurrir en\r\nlas Censuras sino solo à los hechos ò dichos esteriores, porque la\r\nYglesia no juzga de las cosas asi ocultas, y habiendo sido las que el\r\ndicho S^{r} Visorrey ha hecho tan manifiestamente en perjuicio de la\r\nYnquisicion y su libertad y autoridad en grande agravio y ofenza de las\r\npersonas del Santo Oficio, como se ha visto en muchos casos, que por ser\r\ntan notorios no se refieren, las cuales cosas antes de la absolucion\r\nrequieren satisfaccion condigna, especialmente lo que toca al notorio\r\nagravio que al dicho D^{r} Dionicio de Salinas Abogado de este Santo\r\nOficio hizo su Señoria, en el tormento que le diò, pidiendo como el\r\ndicho D^{r} Salinas lo tiene pedido asi en este Santo Oficio.--Atento à\r\nlo cual los dichos Señores Ynquisidores amonestan à su Señoria del dicho\r\nS^{r} Visorrey que para que la absolucion por su Señoria pedida se le\r\npueda dar y conseguirse el fruto de ella, ante todas cosas satisfaga en\r\ncuanto en si fuere al dicho D^{r} Salinas en la forma que mejor se\r\npudiere, atendiendo en todo à la autoridad de su oficio, à la cual no se\r\npretende derogar, sino hacerse lo que los dichos Ynquisidores estan\r\nobligados de derecho por aver como hay parte lesa que insta. Porque à lo\r\nque toca à la injuria y ofensa hecha al Santo Oficio, lo remiten (segun\r\nque lo tienen remitido) al Yll^{mo} S^{r} Cardenal Ynquisidor General y\r\nSeñores del Consejo de la Santa general Ynquisicion, con todas las demas\r\ncausas à esto tocantes, y que por ser cosa llana que el dicho S^{r} Viso\r\nRey estando incurso en las dichas censuras por las dichas razones, y\r\nconstar à los dichos Ynquisidores que habiendo sido advertido su Señoria\r\nno hacia diligencia alguna para salir de ellas, y que estaba à punto de\r\nembarcarse para España (viage tan peligroso como se sabe, especialmente\r\nen personas de edad) de nuevo se le enviò à advertir de palabra; y como\r\ntodavia no hacia diligencia alguna, estandose siempre en las dichas\r\nCensuras, porque no fuese ligado en ellas, pareciò à los dichos\r\nYnquisidores, movidos con celo de caridad para obligar à su Señoria à la\r\nseguridad de su conciencia, y que entendiese el peligro y riesgo de\r\nella, declarar como declararon (como Ministros del derecho à quien\r\ncompetia el hacerlo) el haber su Señoria incurrido en las dichas\r\nCensuras; y acatando el respeto que se debe à su persona y oficio, se\r\nhizo la dicha declaracion en la sala de la Audiencia del Santo Oficio\r\nsin otros testigos mas que el presente Secretario, y de ello se diò\r\nnoticia à su Señoria para el dicho efecto. En razon de lo cual como\r\nparece por la dicha peticion, pide su Señoria el beneficio de la\r\nabsolucion en este Santo Oficio, la cual los dichos Señores Ynquisidores\r\nestan prestos de le dar en la forma que pueden y deben, conforme à\r\nderecho, haciendo su Señoria del S^{r} Virrey de su parte lo que esta\r\nobligado, conforme à lo dicho, sin que por esto pretendan obligar al\r\ndicho S^{r} Viso Rey à cumplir con las demas solemnidades que el derecho\r\nrequiere en semejantes casos, atendiendo à la calidad de su persona y\r\noficio como esta dicho; y asi lo proveyeron y firmaron.--El D^{r} Juan\r\nRuiz de Prado.--El Lisenciado Antonio Gutierrez de Ulloa.--Antemi,\r\nGeronimo de Eugui Secretario.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbuses of Inq. of Sicily, 10, 13, 18, 19, 21, 30, 37, 41, 518\r\n  of Sardinia, 117\r\n  of Mexico, 251, 254\r\n  of Peru, 335, 356, 375, 387, 435\r\n  of New Granada, 473, 479, 487, 498\r\n\r\nAccounts, statements of, refused by Inq. of Mexico, 216\r\n  by Inq. of Peru, 342\r\n  by Inq. of New Granada, 501\r\n\r\nAcereta, Lorenza, case of, 461\r\n\r\nAcqui, Bp. of, as inqr., 131\r\n\r\nAcquittal, honors rendered in, 430, 437\r\n\r\nAdrian, Card., endeavors to reform the Inq., 18\r\n\r\nAgliata, Marino, case of, 34\r\n\r\nAguirre, Fermin de, case of, 396\r\n\r\nAguirre, Francisco de, case of, 322\r\n\r\nAillon, Nicolás de, a mystic, 405\r\n\r\nAlaman, Lucas, prosecution of, 274\r\n\r\nAlba, Viceroy, of Sicily, 29, 33\r\n\r\nAlba, Viceroy, of Naples, 95\r\n\r\nAlbonesi, Tullio, his report as to Milan, 127, 129\r\n\r\nAlburquerque, Duke of, on papal jurisdiction, 135\r\n\r\n_Alcavala_, inqrs. subjected to, 215\r\n\r\nAldegato, Ambrosio, inqr. of Mantua, 133\r\n\r\nAlguazils, number of, in Mexico, 252, 267\r\n  sale of office of, 349\r\n\r\nAlguazil mayor, office of, refused, 188\r\n\r\nAlguazils, royal, arrest of, 252\r\n\r\nAlcalá, Viceroy of Naples, 80\r\n  claims confiscations, 84\r\n  his instructions to Reggio, 89\r\n  insists on exequatur, 90\r\n\r\nAlexander VI, his bull of 1493, 191\r\n\r\nAlienations of real estate, 14\r\n\r\nAlmendáriz, Bp. of Cuba, 475\r\n\r\nAlmoguera, Abp., his Instructions, 445\r\n\r\nAlonso, Bartolomé, case of, 184\r\n\r\nAltolaguirre, Felipe de, 367\r\n\r\nAlva de Aliste, Viceroy, on confiscations, 219\r\n  warned to favor Inq., 374\r\n  complains of Inq., 381\r\n\r\nAlvarez de Arellano, case of, 229\r\n\r\nAlvarez, Duarte, case of, 155\r\n\r\nAlvarez, Sebastian, burnt, 236\r\n\r\nAmat y Yunient, Viceroy, complains of Inq., 381\r\n\r\nAmerica, New Christians forbidden access to, 193\r\n\r\nAmusquíbar, Inqr., his alliance with Ilarduy, 35\r\n  denounces his colleagues, 366, 410, 435\r\n  disputes royal cédula, 388\r\n  quarrels with Abp.

It makes him the peer of Motley,\r\n     Prescott and Parkman, his only competitors in the past. To put the\r\n     matter shortly Mr. Lea has produced a work on a subject of\r\n     absorbing interest, which for many a long day to come must serve as\r\n     an authority to European experts on the subject.”--_New York\r\n     Times._\r\n\r\n     _The New York Tribune_ describes the work as “an historical classic\r\n     in which thoroughness, fairness and reserve are combined in a\r\n     readable presentation of facts of universal interest.”\r\n\r\n     “Dr. Lea has given the world of thoughtful students a work that\r\n     will have a lasting place and a growing power in the right use of\r\n     history. His works have found many readers in Europe, where the\r\n     questions of Church and State are much more acute than in this\r\n     country. Here scholars and the growing army of historical students\r\n     and writers all unite to do honor to Doctor Lea as the foremost\r\n     American historian, whose researches in an almost unknown field\r\n     have shown how great a power he possesses of throwing new light on\r\n     old facts and marshalling historical evidence so as to give the\r\n     world a new picture of a far-distant past.”--_Philadelphia Ledger._\r\n\r\n     “Rarely has so significant an institution been so sanely and\r\n     comprehensively studied, and rarely has the reader been placed in\r\n     so good a position to observe its workings and draw his own\r\n     conclusions from the evidence presented.”--_The Nation._\r\n\r\nIt is one of the most interesting problems in human history that Spain,\r\nwhose brilliant achievements promised to make her as dominant in the\r\nworld of letters as in military and naval enterprise, should, within the\r\nspace of a couple of generations, have become the most uncultured land\r\nin Christendom. For this there must have been a cause and no other\r\nadequate one than the Inquisition has been discovered.

In 1517,\r\nwhen the receiver Garcí Cid was settling his accounts, he claimed\r\ncredit for 700 ounces which he had deposited with a banker in Messina,\r\nwhere Moncada seized it. Cardinal Adrian the inquisitor-general\r\nthereupon ordered Inquisitor Cervera to summon the banker to return\r\nthe money, for the viceroy had express orders from Ferdinand not to\r\nmeddle with the property of the tribunal. If, however, the banker\r\ncould prove that Moncada had taken it by force, then Garcí Cid could\r\nproceed to collect it from the revenues of the Priorazgo of St. John\r\nat Messina, which belonged to Moncada. If the banker could not prove\r\nthis, he must pay the money and have recourse against the property and\r\nrevenues of Moncada. Hereafter, Adrian concludes, no one shall dare to\r\ntake the property of the Inquisition, for the Catholic king ordered\r\nthat it should be used to purchase rents for the perpetuation of the\r\ntribunal.--Archivo de Simancas, Inquisicion, Lib. 933.\r\n\r\n[38] Argensola, _op. cit._, Lib.

Leon nursed his wrath\r\nand when in Rome, in 1519, commenced an action against Calvete in the\r\npapal courts which caused him so much vexation that he threatened to\r\nabandon his post in Sicily and return to Spain. Charles V intervened,\r\nwriting repeatedly to his ambassadors, to cardinals and to Leon\r\nhimself, threatening him with the seizure of his temporalities, but\r\nthe vindictive canon held good and, in 1520, obtained a judgement\r\nof 1000 ducats and costs, as Calvete could not go to Rome to defend\r\nhimself.--Archivo de Simancas, Inq., Lib. 6, fol. 74, 75, 78; Lib. 9,\r\nfol. 52-54.\r\n\r\n[43] La Mantia, p. 43.\r\n\r\n[44] Archivo de Simancas, Inquisicion, Lib. 933.

This however is impossible as the former\r\nwas a delegation from the pope over which the emperor had no control\r\nand any attempt to do so would have been equivalent to abolishing the\r\nInquisition, while the auto of 1541 shows that it continued to exercise\r\nits spiritual jurisdiction. It assumed however that its capacity to\r\nsuppress heresy was fatally crippled by depriving its officials of the\r\nprivilege of its exclusive forum, as expressed in a document quoted\r\nby Franchina (p. 69)--“Notandum est quod quando in anno 1535 fuit\r\nlimitata seu suspensa jurisdictio temporalis hujus Sancti Officii in\r\naliquibus casibus per invictissimum imperatorem Carolum V felicis\r\nmemoriæ, jurisdictio spiritualis causarum fidei fuit in suspenso et\r\nquasi mortua.” So a consulta of the Suprema to Philip III, October 2,\r\n1609, refers to Charles having deprived the Sicilian Inquisition of its\r\ntemporal jurisdiction, resulting in such recrudescence of heresy that\r\nhe was obliged to restore it.--Archivo de Simancas, Inquisicion, Lib.\r\n927, fol. 323.\r\n\r\nInquisitor Páramo, in a letter of November 8, 1600, to Philip III,\r\nstates the case to be that Charles was misled by false accounts of the\r\nmisdeeds of the familiars and deprived them of their immunities but, on\r\nbeing better informed, he restored them.--Ibidem, Lib. 41, fol. 258.\r\n\r\n[52] Páramo, pp. 202-3.--Parecer de Martin Real, ubi sup.\r\n\r\n[53] Franchina, pp. 149, 159, 163.\r\n\r\n[54] Páramo, p. 43.

The\r\nfinancial mismanagement of the Sicilian tribunal was notorious. In\r\n1560, the Contador-general Zurita states that he had finished auditing\r\nits accounts with much labor, as they had not been examined for twenty\r\nyears and were in much disorder.--Ibidem, fol. 239.\r\n\r\n[56] La Mantia, p. 50.\r\n\r\n[57] Franchina, pp. 167, 183.--Páramo, p. 204.\r\n\r\n[58] Llorente, Historia crítica, cap. XVI, art. ii, n.\r\n5. The date of this affair is not unimportant and has curiously been\r\ninvolved in doubt. As printed by Llorente, the letter of December 16,\r\n1543, is duly signed Prince Philip and is doubtless correctly dated, as\r\nTerranova was governor in 1544 (Gervasii Siculæ Sanctiones, I, 295).\r\nIt is somewhat remarkable that in the Simancas archives (Legajo 1465,\r\nfol. 60) there are two letters of Philip II on this affair, one dated\r\nfrom the Escorial, April 24, 1568, to the Sicilian inquisitors and the\r\nother to Terranova, dated from Madrid, April 29, 1568. The dates are\r\nevidently erroneous for in that year the Marquis of Pescara was viceroy\r\n(Gervasii, III, 121). Portocarrero also blunders in the date (_op.\r\ncit._, n. 105), placing the affair in 1608. La Mantia moreover says (p.\r\n52) that a MS. copy of a letter of the inquisitors, April 10th, bears\r\na later date. A letter of the Suprema to the inquisitors, prescribing\r\nthe punishment, is dated December 15th, without indication of the year\r\n(Simancas, Lib. 78, fol. 372). It speaks of two familiars tortured,\r\norders Terranova to hear mass in a monastery as a penitent and to pay\r\nthe sufferers 200 ducats, to which the officials concerned in the\r\naffair were to add 100 more.\r\n\r\n[59] Franchina, p. 174.\r\n\r\n[60] La Mantia, pp. 52-4.--Franchina, p. 188.--Portocarrero, n. 77.\r\n\r\n[61] Franchina, pp. 45-53.\r\n\r\n[62] La Mantia, pp. 55-6.\r\n\r\n[63] La Mantia, pp. 58-9.\r\n\r\n[64] Páramo, p. 210.--MSS. of Library of Univ. of Halle, Yc, 17.\r\n\r\n[65] MSS. of Royal Library of Copenhagen, 214 fol.--Páramo, p. 212.\r\n\r\n[66] Franchina, p. 78.\r\n\r\n[67] MSS. of Library of Univ. of Halle, Yc, 17.\r\n\r\n[68] MSS. of Library of Univ. of Halle, Yc, 17.\r\n\r\n[69] Ibidem, _ubi sup._\r\n\r\n[70] Archivo de Simancas, Inquisicion, Lib. 41, fol. 258, 263.

This work of\r\nMongitore was reprinted in 1868, when the editor F. Guidicini mentions\r\nin the Preface that on March 9th of that year a petition was presented\r\nto the Italian Chamber of Deputies, from a Palermitan family, begging\r\nthe remission of a yearly payment to the royal domain, imposed on\r\nthem by the Inquisition to defray the expenses of the trial of their\r\nkinswoman, the Sister Geltruda, burnt in 1724.\r\n\r\nIt was probably the celebration of this auto that inspired an anonymous\r\nwriter to denounce the inquisitorial procedure in a little work\r\nentitled “Le prove praticate nelli tempi presenti dagl’ Inquisitori di\r\nFede sono manchevole.” This was answered by Doctor Don Miguel Monge,\r\na professor in the University of Huesca in “La verdadera Practica\r\nApostolica de el S.

An episode of this\r\nbusiness concerned one Nofre Pelayo, a merchant of Valencia, who was\r\narrested on the charge of concealing some of Pantolosa’s property. On\r\nJanuary 15, 1498, Ferdinand warmly praised the inquisitor for this\r\naction but he speedily changed his mind and, on March 6th, scolded him\r\nfor keeping Pelayo in prison and refusing to admit him to bail. It\r\nseems that he had in his hands two hundred and fifty ducats, supposed\r\nto belong to Pantolosa, but the sum was claimed by Miguel de Fluto, who\r\nluckily was a kinsman of the Neapolitan ambassador; the latter induced\r\nhis master to write on the subject to Ferdinand who, on March 19, 1499,\r\nordered the sum to be paid to the ambassador’s order.--Ibidem.\r\n\r\nThese transactions are worth noting as an illustration of the\r\ndestructive influence on commerce of the methods of confiscation.\r\n\r\n[105] Archivo de Simancas, Inquisicion, Lib.

This\r\nis evident from the fact that when, in 1504, Ferdinand and Isabella\r\nresolved to introduce the Inquisition they formally released Gonsalvo\r\nfrom the obligation, giving as a reason that no Catholic was required\r\nto observe obligations in derogation of the faith--“non obstantibus\r\nin præmissis aut aliquo præmissorum quibusvis pactis, conventionibus\r\naut capitulationibus per vos præfatum illustrem ducem aut alium\r\nquemcunque, nomine nostro vel vestro in deditione civitatis Neapolis\r\naut alias quandocunque factis, conventis aut juratis, cum ea quæ contra\r\nfidem faciunt nullo pacto a Catholicis observanda sunt, quinimmo\r\neasdem si tales sunt quæ prædictis aliquatenus obviare censeantur cum\r\npræsentibus quoad hæc revocamus, taxamus, annullamus et irritamus, pro\r\ncassisque, irritis ac nullis nulliusque roboris seu momenti haberi\r\nvolumus et habemus, cæteris autem ad hæc non tangentibus in suo robore\r\npermanentibus.”--Páramo, De Origine Officii S.

When Charles of Anjou introduced the Inquisition\r\nhe took the confiscations, as was customary in France, and paid\r\nthe expenses, but in 1290 his son, Charles the Lame, divided the\r\nproceeds into thirds, one for the fisc, one for the Inquisition and\r\none for the propagation of the faith, a rule which probably became\r\npermanent.--Hist. of Inquisition of Middle Ages, I, 511-12.\r\n\r\n[108] Chioccarello MSS., T.

XIV de Synodo diœcesana, Lib. IX, cap. iv, n. 3). This\r\nwas fully admitted by the Roman Inquisition (Decret. S. Congr. S.\r\nOfficii, pp. 174-5, 177, 266-8, 272-3 ap. R. Archivio di Stato in Roma,\r\nFondo Camerale, Congr. del S. Offizio, Vol. 3).\r\n\r\n[179] Amabile, Fra Tommaso Campanella, II, 120-1 (Napoli, 1882).\r\n\r\n[180] Chioccarello MSS., T.

They relate with\r\npride that in Spain men cited to appear, even on matters not pertaining\r\nto the faith, but ignorant of the cause, were known to take to their\r\nbeds and die of sheer terror. How much greater, then, they ask, must\r\nbe the horror of those accused, suddenly arrested and cast into the\r\nstrictest and most secret prison, not to mention what followed?--“Sola\r\nsimplici vocatione alicujus inquisitoris in Hispania, ait Morillus\r\ncitatus, per aliquem ejus ministrum, ad negotium forte particulare\r\nnon pertinens ad Inquisitionem Fidei, absque eo quod vocati sciant ad\r\nquid vocentur, adeo perterrefieri homines soleant, ut aliquibus statim\r\nnecessario decumbere et præ nimio dolore febri superveniente emori\r\ncontigerit.

An English girl of 13, named Ellen Bowes, was\r\nforcibly abducted from her father’s house, after surrounding it with\r\nabout a hundred armed men. Against this outrage the consul protested as\r\na violation of the privileges of the English nation, to which Fogliani\r\nreplied, explaining the reasons which had led the king to do this and\r\nwhat was proposed to do with the child. Apparently she had expressed\r\nan intention to join the Catholic Church and had been taken so as to\r\nsecure her conversion. Allen rejoined in a long argumentative letter\r\nand, although he pointed out that a child of such tender age could have\r\nno conception of the different religions, he felt himself obliged to\r\ndisavow asking her return to her parents and limited his request to\r\nhaving her delivered to some one of the English nation, where she could\r\nbe examined as to her motives. What was the issue of the affair does\r\nnot appear from the paper in my possession, but evidently the king,\r\nafter taking such a step and justifying it, could not well retreat.\r\n\r\n[196] Lettera circolare del Marchese Fraggiani, Napoli,\r\n1761.--Beccatini, Istoria della Inquisizione, pp. 372-77, 382 (Milano,\r\n1797).--Amabile, _op. cit._, II, 104-5; Appendice, 80.\r\n\r\n[197] Supplica al Re nostro Signore de’ Deputati por opporsi ai\r\npregindizj del S.

One of these\r\nlikewise exhibits Ghislieri’s implacable persistence. Vittore Soranzo,\r\nBishop of Brescia, was overcurious in reading heretic books. Ghislieri\r\nwas sent to make a secret investigation and, on his report, Soranzo was\r\nsummoned to Rome and confined in the castle of Sant’ Angelo for two\r\nyears. Nothing was proved against him; he was released and returned\r\nto his see, where he continued to perform his functions until 1558.\r\nIn 1557 Ghislieri was promoted to the cardinalate and, in 1558, Paul\r\nIV created for him the office of supreme inquisitor--an office which\r\nhe was careful not to perpetuate after he became Pius V. He had not\r\nforgotten his failure to convict Soranzo.

At length, in 1289 it admitted an inquisitor, but\r\nadjoined to him the Assistenti, who were not to partake in the\r\njudgements but to see that he did not overstep his proper functions\r\nand to lend when necessary the aid of the secular arm. As the mainland\r\nterritory of the Republic increased and the reorganized papal\r\nInquisition appointed its delegates in the cities, the Signoria in\r\n1548 provided that the _rettori_ or other magistrates in each place\r\nshould coöperate with the inquisitor and bishop as _assistenti_. Rome\r\ntook umbrage at this and a prolonged negotiation ensued, which ended\r\nwith the _assistenti_ being accepted, with the understanding that\r\nthey were to have a consultative but not a decisive vote. This gave\r\nthe Signoria power to curb excesses and to save the people from being\r\nharassed with inquisitorial prosecutions for trifling cases of sorcery,\r\nbigamy, etc., which were so bitterly complained of elsewhere. If we may\r\nbelieve Páramo, when Philip failed to inflict the Spanish Inquisition\r\non Milan, Pius V sought to introduce one of the same kind in Venice,\r\nbut the proposition produced so alarming a popular excitement that\r\nthe Signoria prevailed upon him to abandon the attempt, promising at\r\nthe same time to exercise the greatest vigilance in the suppression\r\nof heresy.--Vettor Sandi, Principj di Storia Civile della Repubblica\r\ndi Venezia, Lib.

This may very probably have\r\nbeen the occasion of the decree just referred to.\r\n\r\nYet the duke, in 1567, offered no opposition when Pius V ordered him to\r\nsend to Rome for trial the canon Ceruti, who, in 1569, was condemned to\r\nthe galleys for life. He could not have been a Protestant for his chief\r\nheresy was the denial of immortality. The intercession of the duke\r\nhowever, in 1572, procured his liberation and permission to keep his\r\nhouse in Mantua as a prison.--Bertolotti, Martiri del Libero Pensiero,\r\npp. 43-5 (Roma, 1891).\r\n\r\n[253] MSS. of Ambrosian Library, Tom. 5, F, 41, and F, 177, P. Inf.\r\n\r\nCatena relates (Vita di Pio V, p. 157) that an heretical preacher of\r\nMorbegno in the Valtelline, named Francesco Cellaria was accustomed\r\nto visit Mantua secretly as a missionary, where he had relations with\r\nsome of the nobles. To put an end to this, Pius sent in disguise the\r\nDominican Piero Angelo Casannova to the Valtelline with instructions\r\nfor his capture. With a band of eight men Casannova kidnapped him at\r\nBocca d’Adda, as he was returning from Coire to Morbegno, hurried\r\nhim to Piacenza whence Duke Ottavio Farnese transmitted him to Rome.\r\nThere he was condemned to be burnt alive but at the last moment he\r\nweakened and recanted, so that he was strangled before burning. He\r\nhad been forced to name his accomplices in Mantua and other cities,\r\nand immediate steps were taken for securing them. The Grisons\r\ncomplained loudly of this invasion of their territory, but the Duke of\r\nAlburquerque, then Governor of Milan (1564-71), replied that the papal\r\njurisdiction over heresy was supreme in all lands.\r\n\r\n[254] MSS. of Ambrosian Library, Tom. 56, F, 106, P.

The result of this\r\nwas that traders returning from heretic lands were watched, reports\r\nwere sent to Rome and they were publicly cited to appear there.\r\nThe transalpine countries took offence at this and then the public\r\ncitations were made at the residence of the parties. Venice sought\r\nto diminish the evil effect of this on commerce by forbidding public\r\ncitations in such cases.--Sarpi, Historia dell’ Inquisizione, p. 77\r\n(Serravalle, 1638).\r\n\r\nSimply trading with heretics, sending to or receiving from them\r\nmerchandise, money or letters constituted fautorship of heresy and\r\nsubjected the trader to the jurisdiction of the Inquisition.--Masini,\r\nSacro Arsenale overo Prattica dell’ Officio della S.

In 1573 the Córtes\r\nrepresented that its profits had caused the abandonment of sugar\r\nculture, which had formerly supplied the Spanish sugar market, greatly\r\nenhancing its price and deteriorating its quality, while at the same\r\ntime the flourishing wine-trade was being ruined.

The first see erected\r\nin Cuba was that of Santiago, in 1522 (Gams, p. 146), and there could\r\nhave been none as early as 1516, as the first expedition to the island\r\nunder Diego Velázquez did not occur until 1511. Hefele (Der Cardinal\r\nXimenes, p. 497) makes Ximenes appoint Alessandro Geraldino, Bishop of\r\nSan Domingo and his colleague of la Vega inquisitors-general but, as we\r\nhave seen, Geraldino was not appointed as bishop until 1522, four years\r\nafter the death of Ximenes.\r\n\r\n[388] Remesal, Historia de la Provincia de S.

In 1541\r\nhe was appointed inquisitor of Saragossa.--Archivo de Simancas,\r\nInquisicion, Sala 40, Lib. 4, fol. 117.\r\n\r\n[402] Torquemada, Lib. XIX, cap. 29. For almost all the\r\nearly inquisitors of Mexico the tribunal was the stepping-stone to the\r\nepiscopate. Bonilla, who went, in 1571, as fiscal, became inquisitor\r\nin 1573 and Archbishop of Mexico in 1592. Alonso Granero, who went as\r\ninquisitor in 1574, became Bishop of Charcas the same year. Santos\r\nGarcía was inquisitor in 1576 and Bishop of Jalisco in 1597. Alonso de\r\nPeralta, who was inquisitor in 1594, was made Archbishop of La Plata in\r\n1609, and Lobo Guerrero, who was inquisitor in 1593, became Archbishop\r\nof Santafé in 1598.\r\n\r\nIt illustrates the character of the men occupying these positions\r\nthat when Granero left Mexico for his bishopric he went by land and\r\nin Nicaragua he assumed still to be inquisitor, condemning people and\r\nfining them to defray his travelling expenses. An unlucky notary named\r\nRodrigo de Evora wrote some satiric couplets about him, whereupon he\r\nwas thrown in prison with chains on hands and feet, tortured till he\r\nwas crippled with dislocated joints and then exposed in a public auto\r\nand condemned to 300 lashes and six years of galleys. The scourging\r\nwas administered with excessive severity and Evora had to beg his way\r\nto Mexico to appeal to the tribunal there. He evidently was stripped\r\nof his property and among other things of four cases of Chinese ware,\r\nwhich Granero appropriated to his own use.--Medina, _op. cit._, 76-78.\r\n\r\n[403] Medina, _op. cit._, p. 22.\r\n\r\n[404] See Appendix.\r\n\r\n[405] Mr. Elkan N.

The fourth sister of Carvajal was burnt\r\nfor relapse in the auto of 1601 and a fifth was reconciled (Medina, pp.\r\n131-133).\r\n\r\nAn incident of Carvajal’s trial illustrates the dread excited by the\r\npitiless Peralta, who richly earned his archbishopric. After prolonged\r\ntorture and confession, Carvajal endeavored to commit suicide and then\r\nasked for Lobo Guerrero to be sent for, to whom he explained that he\r\nhad begged that Peralta should not be present “because the mere sight\r\nof him made his flesh creep, such was the terror with which his rigor\r\ninspired him.”--Adler, Trial of Jorje de Almeida (Publications of Am.\r\nJewish Hist. Soc., IV, 42).\r\n\r\nThe complaints against Peralta accumulated until the Suprema was\r\ncompelled to formulate a process against him in which the _sumaria_\r\ncontained thirty-two charges, not only of arbitrary cruelty but of\r\nprostitution of his office for illicit gain (Medina, p. 216); but this,\r\nas we have seen, did not prevent his promotion to the archiepiscopate\r\nof La Plata.\r\n\r\n[414] Obregon, p. 391.\r\n\r\n[415] Las Casas, Hist. de las Indias, Lib.

XXIV, De Reform., cap.\r\n6) which admitted that bishops had only power to absolve for secret\r\nheresy, while even this was denied them by the bulls _In Cœna Domini_\r\nof Pius V and his successors.\r\n\r\n[419] Bancroft, History of Mexico, III, 747, 750.--Las Casas, Hist. de\r\nlas Indias, Lib.

LXIV,\r\n7, 386).\r\n\r\n[420] The Dominican Thomas Gage when, about the year 1630, he was\r\nserving as a missionary priest at Mixco in Guatemala, discovered,\r\nafter considerable trouble, an idol in a cave, secretly worshipped by\r\nthe leading Indians of the vicinage. After relating his adventures\r\nin the search, he proceeds “I writ to the President of Guatemala\r\ninforming him of what I had don and to the Bishop (as an Inquisitor\r\nto whom such cases of Idolatry did belong) to be informed of him what\r\ncourse I should take with the Indians, who were but in part as yet\r\ndiscovered unto me and those only by the relation of one Indian. From\r\nboth I received great thanks for my pains in searching the mountains\r\nand finding the Idol and for my zeal in burning of it. And as touching\r\nthe Indian Idolators their counsel unto me was that I should further\r\nenquire after the rest and discover as many as I could and endeavor to\r\nconvert them to the knowledge of the true God by fair and sweet means,\r\nshowing pity unto them for their great blindness and promising them\r\nupon their repentance pardon from the Inquisition, which considering\r\nthem to be but new plants useth not such rigor with them, which it\r\nuseth with Spaniards if they fall into such horrible sins.”--Gage’s New\r\nSurvey of the West Indies, pp. 397-8 (London, 1677).\r\n\r\nFor a considerable time the Indians seem to have escaped persecution,\r\nbut at length the bishops--or at least some of them--formed\r\nInquisitions for them and conducted these in inquisitorial fashion.\r\nIn 1690 the Bishop of Oaxaca, having discovered organized idolatry\r\nin eleven pueblos of the Sierra de Xuquil, held an auto in which the\r\nculprits were reconciled and penanced, twenty-six of the principal\r\nones being condemned to perpetual prison, for which he constructed\r\nan appropriate building. Possibly the fact that persecution was\r\nunprofitable may explain the infrequency of these proceedings. The\r\nfirst Indian auto in the city of Mexico seems to have been held\r\nDecember 23, 1731, which was followed occasionally by others--bigamy,\r\nsuperstitions and idolatry being the common offences. In 1769\r\nthe Archbishop of Mexico published an Edict of Faith requiring\r\ndenunciations of Indian practices to his _Tribunal de Fe_. This\r\nexcited the indignation of the Inquisitors who vainly demanded its\r\nsuppression and then appealed to the Suprema, probably with no better\r\nsuccess.--Medina, pp. 371-8.\r\n\r\n[421] Recop. de las Indias, Lib.

In the\r\nearlier period of the colonial Inquisition, the inquisitors sometimes,\r\nas we have seen, held prebends in addition to their salaries, but this\r\nprivilege was subsequently withdrawn, at the instance of the Council\r\nof Indies, on account of the poverty of the churches.--Solorzani, _op.\r\ncit._, Lib.

October 24, 1636, the Suprema reports\r\nthat up to that time, only those of Mexico, Puebla, Oaxaca and\r\nGuatemala, had become available, the aggregate revenues of which did\r\nnot amount to the royal subvention. The tribunal had reported, January\r\n23d, that a vacancy had occurred in the cathedral of Guadalajara and\r\nthe king is urged to lose no time in ordering its suppression.--Ibidem,\r\nLib. 21, fol. 67.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the century the tribunal enjoyed canonries in\r\nMexico, Puebla, Oaxaca, Chiapa, Yucatan, Guatemala, Mechoacan,\r\nGuadalajara and Manila. In Mexico the sees of Guadiana, Honduras and\r\nNicaragua, and in the Philippines those of Cebu, Cagayan and Nueva\r\nSegovia were too poor, some of them not even having prebendaries, and\r\nthe bishops were supported by the treasury.--Medina, p. 209.\r\n\r\n[432] MSS. of David Fergusson Esqr.\r\n\r\n[433] Archivo de Simancas, Inquisicion, Lib. 40, fol. 44.--Recop., Lib.\r\nI, Tit. xix, ley 30, § 1.\r\n\r\n[434] Medina, p. 209.\r\n\r\n[435] Archivo de Simancas, Inquisicion, Lib. 40, fol. 85, 139. In these\r\npapers the Suprema had the hardihood to assert that the prebends were\r\nsuppressed in order to enable the tribunals to meet expenses over and\r\nabove the royal subvention for salaries, although all the documents\r\nshow that the object was to relieve the treasury.\r\n\r\n[436] Archivo de Simancas, Inquisicion, Lib. 40, fol. 91, 103.\r\n\r\n[437] J.

The great\r\nremittances of 1646 and 1648 were cautiously made in bills of exchange,\r\nand this was probably the rule.\r\n\r\n[441] Archivo de Simancas, Inquisicion, Lib. 40, fol. 77.\r\n\r\n[442] Archivo de Simancas, Inquisicion, Lib. 40, fol. 85, 139.\r\n\r\nThe letter-book of the tribunal from 1642 to 1649 is largely filled\r\nwith minute instructions as to the sequestrations which accompanied\r\narrests and the management of the property seized. Though called\r\nsequestration this was really confiscation for, without awaiting\r\nthe conviction of the accused, the assets were converted into money\r\nas rapidly as possible, by auctions in which of course much was\r\nsacrificed. The proceedings were most arbitrary. In a letter of October\r\n21, 1645, the commissioner at Vera Cruz is instructed as to some cocoa\r\nbelonging to prisoners, either on hand or expected to arrive. Trains\r\nof pack-mules were to be seized, no matter under what engagements they\r\nmight be, to hurry the goods to Mexico and no other cocoa was to be\r\nallowed to come, so that this might bring a better price. A few weeks\r\nearlier, on September 25th, orders were sent for the arrest of Captain\r\nFernando Moreno of Miaguatlan (Oaxaca), who was claimed to be a debtor\r\nto the fisc. He was to be seized suddenly and hurried off, heavily\r\nironed, to Mexico, while his property was taken possession of. He was\r\nengaged in large transactions of making advances to Indians for cotton\r\nyarn and cochineal and minute instructions were given as to gathering\r\nin the product of these advances, which would be an affair of time.\r\nAll this work had to be gratuitous. When on one occasion a familiar\r\nand a notary charged for their labor, they were compelled to refund\r\nand were told that the honor of serving the Inquisition was sufficient\r\npayment.--MSS. of David Fergusson Esqr.\r\n\r\n[443] Bibl. nacional, MSS., D, 150, p. 224.\r\n\r\n[444] Archivo de Simancas, Lib. 40, fol. 218, 328.\r\n\r\n[445] Archivo de Simancas, fol. 85, 139. In 1631 the _vara_, or wand\r\nof office of alguazil, was sold in Castile and, in 1634, the Suprema\r\nsought to extend this to the Colonies, under pretext of applying it\r\nto the repairs of the Castle of Triana, the home of the tribunal of\r\nSeville. The Council of Indies stoutly resisted it and a consulta of\r\nNovember 16, 1638, shows that the struggle was still going on (Ibidem,\r\nLibro 21, fol. 162). The Suprema finally won, but of course it absorbed\r\nthe proceeds and the castle was repaired by means of the levy known\r\nas the _Fabrica de Sevilla_, which continued to be collected in the\r\nnineteenth century.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the amount attributed to the sale of _varas_ is\r\nlargely exaggerated. In 1652 there came a remittance from Mexico of\r\n2298 pesos, of which 1711 were the proceeds of sales and 587 for the\r\n_media añata_--a tax of half of the first year’s salary of those\r\nappointed to office (Ibidem, Lib. 40, fol. 295).\r\n\r\n[446] Obregon, _op. cit._, 1ª Serie, p. 188.\r\n\r\n[447] Archivo de Simancas, Inquisicion, Lib. 28, fol. 276.\r\n\r\n[448] Medina, pp. 213, 348, 379, 405.\r\n\r\n[449] Archivo de Simancas, Libro, 435, 2º.\r\n\r\n[450] Obregon, _op. cit._, 2º Serie, pp. 352-55. From 1601 to 1646 the\r\nonly sanbenitos were--\r\n\r\n1603. A Fleming relaxed for Calvinism, one Judaizer reconciled and one\r\nrelaxed in effigy and two mulattos reconciled for heresy.\r\n\r\n1605. An Irishman reconciled for Lutheranism and a Portuguese for\r\nJudaism. There were however 36 penitents in this auto of whom 21 were\r\nnegroes and mulattos for blasphemy. When in 1605 the general pardon for\r\nJudaizers descended from Portuguese reached Mexico, there was only one\r\nto be liberated.--Medina, pp. 143, 146.\r\n\r\n1606. A mulatto relaxed for administering sacraments without\r\nordination. There was however another person guilty of the same\r\noffence, a married priest and a blasphemer.--Medina, p. 145.\r\n\r\n1621. A German reconciled for Lutheranism.\r\n\r\n1625. Three Judaizers reconciled.\r\n\r\n1626 One Judaizer relaxed in effigy.\r\n\r\n1630. Three Judaizers reconciled.\r\n\r\n1635. Four Judaizers reconciled, one relaxed in person and four in\r\neffigy. This is evidently incomplete.

One Ash Wednesday, when the canons of the cathedral called\r\nupon the Marquis de Croix, as customary, to present him with ashes, he\r\nkept them waiting in his antechamber, to the intense indignation of\r\nthose dignified personages. They complained to the inquisitors, who\r\nsummoned the viceroy to appear before them. He obeyed, but he went\r\nattended by a guard and some pieces of artillery. He was haughtily\r\nreceived until he took out his watch and casually remarked that he\r\nhoped the audience would be brief for, if he was not back in the street\r\nin ten minutes, the cannon would open on the building and reduce it\r\nto ruins. The dignity of the inquisitors disappeared; they promptly\r\ndismissed him and were in agony as he leisurely sauntered forth.\r\n\r\nIf such an occurrence took place it is attributable with more\r\nverisimilitude to the period of the Marquis de Croix in Mexico than\r\nto the earlier time of the Marquis de Castelfuerte in Peru, of whom a\r\nprecisely similar story is told, except that he gave the tribunal an\r\nhour for consideration. In his case the summons to appear is ascribed\r\nto his rough treatment of the Franciscans, July 5, 1731, when two of\r\nthem were killed in a disturbance at the execution of Dr. Joseph de\r\nAntequera.--Palma, Añales de la Inquisicion de Lima, p. 184 (Madrid,\r\n1898).\r\n\r\n[522] Medina, p. 338.\r\n\r\n[523] Ibidem, pp. 339-45.\r\n\r\n[524] Archivo de Simancas, Inquisicion, Legajo 1465, fol. 81.\r\n\r\n[525] Medina, pp. 358-63.--Archivo de Simancas, Inquisicion, Legajo\r\n1465, fol. 81.\r\n\r\n[526] Medina, pp. 365, 388.\r\n\r\n[527] Ibidem, pp. 396, 432.\r\n\r\n[528] Medina, pp. 387, 397-405.\r\n\r\n[529] Obregon, _op. cit._, 2ª Serie, pp. 389, 392-3.\r\n\r\nLizardi’s troubles did not end with the extinction of the Inquisition.\r\nIn 1822 he issued a defence of Free-Masonry which excited clerical\r\nwrath. In Puebla, a priest, after arousing the people with his sermons,\r\nheaded a mob which broke into a printer’s shop, carried off the\r\nobnoxious books and made an auto de fe of them, leading to a tumult in\r\nwhich three men were killed and a number were wounded.

His\r\n_Exercitationes de Christo ejusque V. Matre_ are in both Indexes. For\r\na Jesuit opinion of the former work see Father Colonia’s _Bibliothèque\r\nJanseniste_, p. 186 (Ed. 1735).\r\n\r\nMaría de Agreda was a Spanish mystic of the seventeenth century whom\r\nSpain has repeatedly, up to modern times, endeavored to get canonized.\r\n\r\n[537] These comprehensive excommunications led to a result not\r\nparticularly creditable to the Church. A writer in 1822 calls attention\r\nto the fact that, while the leading insurgents who were captured were\r\nformally reconciled before they were shot, the mass of the people, who\r\nhad never paid any attention to the censures, were freely received to\r\nthe sacraments without having been absolved.--El Sol, México, Feb. 27,\r\n1822, p. 107.\r\n\r\n[538] See Appendix. One of the insurgent proclamations shows the savage\r\ncharacter of the warfare. It sets forth the terms and conditions of the\r\nstruggle of which the following may serve as a specimen--\r\n\r\n4. The European who resists with arms will be put to the sword.\r\n\r\n5. When threatened with siege or battle, before commencing we will put\r\nto the sword the numerous Europeans in our hands and will then abide\r\nthe fortunes of war.\r\n\r\n6. The American who defends a European with arms will be put to the\r\nsword.\r\n\r\nThus was justified the execution of Hidalgo and his chiefs. Whatever\r\nsympathy we may feel for the cause, we must admit that the cruelty\r\nmarking the strife was equally shared and that the fate of Maximilian\r\nwas foreshadowed.\r\n\r\n[539] In estimating the veracity of this curious tale, we must bear in\r\nmind that both Fernando VII and Pius VII were at the time prisoners of\r\nNapoleon. There was, it is true, a Spanish Regency and the Córtes of\r\nCádiz which used the royal name, but it is inconceivable that, even if\r\nit had access to the pope, it would have taken such a precaution at a\r\ntime when there was no anticipation of rebellion in the colonies.\r\n\r\n[540] Medina, pp. 456-61.\r\n\r\n[541] Ibidem, pp. 461, 463.\r\n\r\n[542] Coleccion de Cédulas etc. de Fernando VII, pp. 8, 85 (Valencia,\r\n1814).\r\n\r\n[543] Archivo de Simancas, Inquisicion, Libros 877, 890.\r\n\r\n[544] Medina, pp. 467-9.\r\n\r\n[545] Medina, pp. 469-70.\r\n\r\n[546] Ibidem, pp. 479-92.\r\n\r\n[547] The following details of the trial of Morelos are derived from a\r\nreport, accompanied by the documents, made by Flores to the Suprema,\r\nNovember 27 and December 29, 1815.

Of these, as we chance to learn from other\r\ndocuments, three, Fray Domingo Fernández, Fray Melchor de Manzano and\r\nFray Martin de la Anunciacion, were all denounced, by different women,\r\non March 31, 1622, to Fray Miguel de San Jacinto, commissioner for the\r\nprovince of New Segovia. As that day was the Thursday after Easter,\r\nthis was probably the result of confessing to a rigid confessor who\r\nrefused absolution until denunciation should be made. Another one was\r\nPadre Pedro Ramírez, S. J., denounced to the Manila commissioner, Fray\r\nDomingo González, Aug. 16, 1622.\r\n\r\nThe comparative infrequency of Jesuit culprits may perhaps be partially\r\nexplained by a remarkable precaution adopted by the Society. A\r\ndeposition under oath, Jan. 20, 1625, made in the Philippines by Padre\r\nBaltasar de Silva, states that experienced and trustworthy women, whom\r\nthey called syndics, were employed to confess to Jesuits and tempt\r\nthem to a certain point. The result was reported to the rector and if\r\none was found to respond to the advances, he was transferred to some\r\nother place before he reached the point of himself soliciting. The\r\nOrder looked with aversion on the requirement of denunciation to the\r\nInquisition and took this method of averting it. In Manila, about 1605,\r\none of these syndics was Doña Mariana Garvi, who was succeeded by Doña\r\nMaría Marmolejo.--MSS. of David Fergusson Esqr.\r\n\r\n[561] Medina, _op. cit._, pp. 48-50.\r\n\r\n[562] Medina, _op. cit._, pp. 53-4.\r\n\r\n[563] Ibidem, pp. 33-4.\r\n\r\n[564] El Museo Mexicano, 1843, p 361.\r\n\r\n[565] Medina, _op. cit._, pp. 59-66.\r\n\r\n[566] Fray Juan de la Concepcion, Historia general de Philipinas, T.\r\nIX, pp. 202-4.\r\n\r\n[567] Medina, _op. cit._, pp. 151-4.\r\n\r\n[568] Medina, _op. cit._, pp. 141-51.\r\n\r\n[569] Ibidem, pp. 161-3.\r\n\r\n[570] Juan de la Concepcion, XIV, 81-107.--Buzeta, Diccionario de las\r\nIslas Filipinas, I, 395 (Madrid, 1850).\r\n\r\n[571] MSS. of Royal Library of Munich, Cod.

In both cases it was the\r\nJesuits acting through _jueces conservadores_, who, by a monstrous\r\nabuse, assumed to exercise full papal powers, but in Mexico the\r\nInquisition was with them and in Manila it was against them.\r\n\r\nThe ecclesiastics had full revenge on Governor Corcuera when, in 1644,\r\nhe was succeeded by Diego Fajardo. In fortifying Manila against an\r\nexpected attack by the Dutch, his lines ran through an Augustinian\r\nconvent. He offered the frailes another house, but they refused to move\r\nand he tore down the building about their ears. When out of office they\r\nprosecuted him and obtained a verdict of 25,000 pesos. He must have\r\nbeen a rarely honest governor, for he was unable to pay it and they\r\nkept him in harsh gaol for five years.

It was claimed\r\nthat his retirement vacated the benefice; the matter was referred to\r\nthe king who decided, by a decree of August 31, 1635, that this was\r\nthe case. The canons adopted the favorite device of obeying without\r\nexecuting and were supported by the Audiencia, much to the disgust of\r\nthe Dean, Tomas de Santiago, who was commissioner of the Inquisition.\r\nMeanwhile another of the canons, Gerónimo Salvatierra, died and the\r\nquestion was finally settled by a royal order of April 6, 1638,\r\npronouncing the vacated prebend to be that of Salvatierra.\r\n\r\nCommissioner Santiago had become violently inimical to some of the\r\ncanons in the course of this dispute and undertook to gratify his\r\nrevenge, when Manuel Bautista Pérez of Lima was burnt and his property\r\nwas confiscated. One of his debtors to the amount of 2000 pesos was a\r\nprominent merchant of Santiago, Pedro Martínez Gago, whose property\r\nwas seized by Santiago; some of the canons were indebted to him for\r\ntrifling amounts and Santiago persecuted them. The quarrel assumed\r\nportentous dimensions through the violence of his proceedings and\r\nliberal use of excommunication, when a new bishop Fray Gaspar de\r\nVillaroel, made his appearance, and undertook to reduce Santiago\r\nto submission. In this he disregarded all the immunities of the\r\nInquisition and, being supported by the civil power and the judiciary,\r\nhe vindicated his episcopal supremacy by arresting the contumacious\r\ncommissioner and imprisoning him in chains. Santiago boldly strove to\r\nmake head against the united secular and ecclesiastical power of the\r\nprovince, but was finally forced to submit. Villaroel does not seem\r\nto have suffered for his audacity. In 1651 he was transferred to the\r\nsee of Arequipa and in 1658 he became Archbishop of la Plata.

The disaffected\r\ncolonists drove out their new masters in 1768, but were subdued the\r\nnext year by O’Reilly. In 1772 the Governor, Don Luis de Unzaga,\r\nin a report to the Bishop of Havana, said “It is not the practice\r\nhere to force any one to submit to the Church, and the process of\r\nexcommunication is held in utter abomination.” This toleration\r\ncontinued and, in 1789, the Governor Estevan Miró was surprised\r\nto receive from Fray Antonio de Sedella--one of a band of Spanish\r\nCapuchins who had been sent to New Orleans in 1772--a communication\r\nstating that, in a letter of December 5th, he had received from the\r\nproper authority a commission as commissioner of the Inquisition, with\r\ninstructions to perform his duties with the utmost zeal and fidelity;\r\nthat, having made his investigations with the greatest secrecy and\r\nprecaution, he notified the governor that, in execution of his\r\ninstructions, he might soon, at some late hour of the night, deem it\r\nnecessary to require some guards to assist him in his operations. That\r\nsame night, April 29th, he was aroused from sleep to find at his door\r\nan officer with a file of grenadiers, when he thanked them and said\r\nthat he had no use for them that night. To his astonishment he was told\r\nthat he was under arrest; he was hurried on board a vessel which sailed\r\nthe next day for Cádiz, and the Inquisition was nipped in the bud. Miró\r\nseems to have been called upon for an explanation, for in a despatch of\r\nJune 3d he declared that he shuddered when he read Sedella’s note. He\r\nhad been ordered to foster immigration from the United States, under\r\npledge of no molestation on account of religion, and the mere name of\r\nthe Inquisition in New Orleans would not only check immigration but\r\nwould be capable of driving away those who had come, and, in spite of\r\nhis action with Sedella, he dreaded the most fatal consequences from\r\nthe mere suspicion of the causes of his dismissal. His justification\r\nseems to have been accepted, for the attempt was abandoned.--Gayarré,\r\nHistory of Louisiana. The Spanish Domination, pp. 56, 69, 269-71 (New\r\nYork, 1854).--Fortier, History of Louisiana, II, 62, 140, 327.\r\n\r\nIt may be assumed that the motive of commissioning Sedella was rather\r\npolitical than religious. The uprising in France was calling for\r\nactive measures by the Inquisition in Spain to keep out revolutionary\r\nprinciples; Louisiana was French and its loyalty to Spain was doubtful,\r\nso that the Inquisition would be useful both as a source of information\r\nand an instrument of repression.\r\n\r\n[769] Medina, pp. 42-50, 76.--Archivo de Simancas, Inquisicion, Leg.\r\n1465, fol. 23.\r\n\r\n[770] Archivo de Simancas, Inquisicion, Lib. 40, fol. 51.\r\n\r\n[771] Medina, pp. 82-96.\r\n\r\n[772] Medina, pp. 100-1.\r\n\r\n[773] Archivo de Simancas, Inquisicion, Libro 30, fol. 180.\r\n\r\n[774] Archivo de Simancas, Inquisicion, Libro 30, fol. 178.\r\n\r\n[775] Medina, pp. 211-19, 225-6.\r\n\r\n[776] Medina, pp. 118-19.\r\n\r\n[777] Ibidem, pp. 158-9.\r\n\r\n[778] Ibidem, pp. 175-94.\r\n\r\n[779] Medina, pp. 222-7.\r\n\r\n[780] Groot, II, 473. This is not strictly correct. After an interval\r\nof many years, Inquisitor Valera published the edict in Lent, 1684,\r\nwhen it brought in denunciations which doubled the number of cases in\r\nhand (Medina, p. 308). Probably this was the last until the nineteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n[781] Medina, pp. 346-51, 364.--Groot, I, 331-6.\r\n\r\n[782] Medina, pp. 369-70.\r\n\r\n[783] Medina, pp. 358, 371.\r\n\r\n[784] Medina, pp. 359-61.\r\n\r\n[785] Ibidem, pp. 374-6.\r\n\r\n[786] Ibidem, p. 378.\r\n\r\n[787] Medina, pp. 379-80, 390.--Archivo de Simancas, Inquisicion, Lib.\r\n25, fol. 52.\r\n\r\n[788] Medina, pp. 380-6.\r\n\r\n[789] Ibidem, pp. 387-9.
