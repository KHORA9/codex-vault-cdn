W. BARDEEN, PUBLISHER,\r\n  1887.\r\n\r\n  Copyright, 1887, by C. W. BARDEEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may not be generally known that Comenius was once solicited to become\r\nPresident of Harvard College. The following is a quotation from Vol. II,\r\np. 14, of Cotton Mather’s MAGNALIA:\r\n\r\n  “That brave old man, Johannes Amos Commenius, the fame of whose\r\n  worth has been TRUMPETTED as far as more than three languages\r\n  (whereof everyone is indebted unto his JANUA) could carry it, was\r\n  indeed agreed withal, by one Mr. Winthrop in his travels through\r\n  the LOW COUNTRIES, to come over to New England, and illuminate\r\n  their Colledge and COUNTRY, in the quality of a President, which\r\n  was now become vacant. But the solicitations of the Swedish\r\n  Ambassador diverting him another way, that incomparable Moravian\r\n  became not an American.”\r\n\r\nThis was on the resignation of President Dunster, in 1654--Note of Prof.\r\nPAYNE, Compayre’s History of Education, Boston, 1886, p. 125.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDITOR’S PREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen it is remembered that this work is not only an educational classic\r\nof prime importance, but that it was the first picture-book ever made\r\nfor children and was for a century the most popular text-book in Europe,\r\nand yet has been for many years unattainable on account of its rarity,\r\nthe wonder is, not that it is reproduced now but that it has not been\r\nreproduced before. But the difficulty has been to find a satisfactory\r\ncopy. Many as have been the editions, few copies have been preserved. It\r\nwas a book children were fond of and wore out in turning the leaves over\r\nand over to see the pictures. Then as the old copper-plates became\r\nindistinct they were replaced by wood-engravings, of coarse execution,\r\nand often of changed treatment. Von Raumer complains that the edition of\r\n1755 substitutes for the original cut of the Soul, (No. 43, as here\r\ngiven,) a picture of an eye, and in a table the figures I. I. II. I. I.\r\nII., and adds that it is difficult to recognize in this an expressive\r\npsychological symbol, and to explain it. In an edition I have, published\r\nin Vienna in 1779, this cut is omitted altogether, and indeed there are\r\nbut 82 in place of the 157 found in earlier editions, the following, as\r\nnumbered in this edition, being omitted:\r\n\r\n1, the alphabet, 2, 36, 43, 45, 66, 68, 75, 76, 78-80, 87, 88, 92-122,\r\n124, 126, 128, 130-141.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Vienna edition contains a curious additional cut.\r\nIt gives No. 4, the Heaven, practically as in this edition, but puts\r\nanother cut under it in which the earth is revolving about the sun; and\r\nafter the statement of Comenius, “_Coelum rotatur, et ambit terram, in\r\nmedio stantem_” interpolates: “_prout veteres crediderunt; recentiores\r\nenim defendunt motum terrae circa solem_” [as the ancients used to\r\nthink; for later authorities hold that the motion of the earth is about\r\nthe sun.]\r\n\r\nTwo specimen pages from another edition are inserted in Payne’s\r\nCompayré’s History of Education (between pp. 126, 127). The cut is the\r\nrepresentative of No. 103 in this edition, but those who compare them\r\nwill see not only how much coarser is the execution of the wood-cut\r\nProf. Payne has copied, but what liberties have been taken with the\r\ndesign. The only change in the Latin text, however, is from _Designat\r\nFiguras rerum_ in the original, to _Figuram rerum designat_.\r\n\r\nIn this edition the cuts are unusually clear copies of the copper-plates\r\nof the first edition of 1658, from which we have also taken the Latin\r\ntext. The text for the English translation is from the English edition\r\nof 1727, in which for the first time the English words were so arranged\r\nas to stand opposite their Latin equivalents.\r\n\r\nThe cuts have been reproduced with great care by the photographic\r\nprocess. I thought best not to permit them to be retouched, preferring\r\noccasional indistinctness to modern tampering with the originals that\r\nwould make them less authentic.\r\n\r\nThe English text is unchanged from that of the 1727 edition, except in\r\nrare instances where substitutions have been made for single words not\r\nnow permissible. The typography suggests rather than imitates the\r\nquaintness of the original, and the paper was carefully selected to\r\nproduce so far as practicable the impression of the old hand-presses.\r\n\r\nIn short my aim has been to put within the reach of teachers at a\r\nmoderate price a satisfactory reproduction of this important book; and\r\nif the sale of the _Orbis Pictus_ seems to warrant it, I hope\r\nsubsequently to print as a companion volume the _Vestibulum_ and _Janua_\r\nof the same author, of which I have choice copies.\r\n\r\n  C. W. BARDEEN.\r\n\r\n  _Syracuse, Sept. 28, 1887_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMENTS UPON THE ORBIS PICTUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring four years he here prosecuted his efforts in behalf of education\r\nwith commendable success, and wrote, among other works, his celebrated\r\nOrbis Pictus, which has passed through a great many editions, and\r\nsurvived a multitude of imitations. --SMITH’S HISTORY OF EDUCATION,\r\nN.Y., 1842, p. 129.\r\n\r\nThe most eminent educator of the seventeenth century, however, was John\r\nAmos Comenius...... His Orbis Sensualium Pictus, published in 1657,\r\nenjoyed a still higher renown. The text was much the same with the\r\nJanua, being intended as a kind of elementary encyclopædia; but _it\r\ndiffered from all previous text-books_, in being illustrated with\r\npictures, on copper and wood, of the various topics discussed in it.\r\nThis book was universally popular. In those portions of Germany where\r\nthe schools had been broken up by the “Thirty years’ war,” mothers\r\ntaught their children from its pages. Corrected and amended by later\r\neditors, it continued for nearly two hundred years, to be a text-book of\r\nthe German schools. --HISTORY AND PROGRESS OF EDUCATION, BY\r\nPHILOBIBLIUS, N.Y., 1860, p. 210.\r\n\r\nThe “Janua” would, therefore, have had but a short-lived popularity with\r\nteachers, and a still shorter with learners, if Comenius had not carried\r\nout his principle of appealing to the senses, and called in the artist.\r\nThe result was the “Orbis Pictus,” a book which proved a favorite with\r\nyoung and old, and maintained its ground in many a school for more than\r\na century.... I am sorry I cannot give a specimen of this celebrated\r\nbook with its quaint pictures. The artist, of course, was wanting in the\r\ntechnical skill which is now commonly displayed even in the cheapest\r\npublications, but this renders his delineations none the less\r\nentertaining. As a picture of the life and manners of the\r\nseventeenthcentury, the work has great historical interest, which will,\r\nI hope, secure for it another English edition. --QUICK’S EDUCATIONAL\r\nREFORMERS, 1868; Syracuse edition, p. 79.\r\n\r\nBut the principle on which he most insisted is that the teaching of\r\nwords and things must go together, hand in hand. When we consider how\r\nmuch time is spent over new languages, what waste of energy is lavished\r\non mere preparation, how it takes so long to lay a foundation that there\r\nis no time to lay a building upon it, we must conclude that it is in the\r\nacceptance and development of this principle that the improvement of\r\neducation will in the future consist. Any one who attempts to inculcate\r\nthis great reform will find that its first principles are contained in\r\nthe writings of Comenius. --ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNICA, 9th edition, vii.\r\n674.\r\n\r\nThe first edition of this celebrated book was published at Nuremberg in\r\n1657; soon after a translation was made into English by Charles Hoole.\r\nThe last English edition appeared in 1777, and this was reprinted in\r\nAmerica in 1812. This was the first illustrated school-book, and was the\r\nfirst attempt at what now passes under the name of “object lessons.”\r\n--SHORT HISTORY OF EDUCATION, W. H. PAYNE, Syracuse, 1881, p. 103.\r\n\r\nOf these, the “Janua” and the “Orbis” were translated into most European\r\nand some of the Oriental languages. It is evident that these practices\r\nof Comenius contain the germs of things afterwards connected with the\r\nnames of Pestalozzi and Stow. It also may be safely assumed that many\r\nmethods that are now in practical use, were then not unknown to earliest\r\nteachers. --GILL’S SYSTEMS OF EDUCATION, London, 1876, p. 13.\r\n\r\nThe more we reflect on the method of Comenius, the more we shall see it\r\nis replete with suggestiveness, and we shall feel surprised that so much\r\nwisdom can have lain in the path of schoolmasters for two hundred and\r\nfifty years, and that they have never stooped to avail themselves of its\r\ntreasures. --BROWNING’S INTRODUCTION TO THE HISTORY OF EDUCATIONAL\r\nTHEORIES, 1882, New York edition, p. 67.\r\n\r\nThe “Orbis Pictus,” the first practical application of the intuitive\r\nmethod, had an extraordinary success, and has served as a model for the\r\ninnumerable illustrated books which for three centuries have invaded the\r\nschools. --COMPAYRE’S HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY, Payne’s translation, Boston,\r\n1886, p. 127.\r\n\r\nHe remained at Patak four years, which were characterized by surprising\r\nliterary activity. During this short period he produced no less than\r\nfifteen different works, among them his “World Illustrated” (_Orbis\r\nPictus_), the most famous of all his writings. It admirably applied the\r\nprinciple that words and things should be learned together.... The\r\n“World Illustrated” had an enormous circulation, and remained for a long\r\ntime the most popular text-book in Europe. --PAINTER’S HISTORY OF\r\nEDUCATION, N.Y., 1886, p. 206.\r\n\r\nOr, si ce livre n’est qu’un équivalent se la véritable intuition; si,\r\nensuite, le contenu du tout paraît fort défectueux, au point de vue de\r\nla science de nos jours; si, enfin, un effort exagéré pour l’intégrité\r\nde la conception de l’enfant a créé, pour les choses modernes, trop de\r\ndénominations latines qui paraissent douteuses, l’Orbis pictus était\r\npourtant, pour son temps, une oeuvre très originale et très spirituelle,\r\nqui fit faire un grand progrès à la pédagogie et servit longtemps de\r\nlivre d’école utile et de modèle à d’innombrables livres d’images,\r\nsouvent pires. --HISTOIRE D’ ÉDUCATION, FREDERICK DITTES, Redolfi’s\r\nFrench translation, Paris, 1880, p. 178.\r\n\r\nHere Comenius wrote, among others, his second celebrated work the “Orbis\r\nPictus.” He was not, however, able to finish it in Hungary for want of a\r\nskilful engraver on copper. For such a one he carried it to Michael\r\nEndter, the bookseller at Nuremberg, but the engraving delayed the\r\npublication of the book for three years more. In 1657 Comenius expressed\r\nthe hope that it would appear during the next autumn. With what great\r\napprobation the work was received at its first appearance, is shown by\r\nthe fact that within two years, in 1659, Endter had published a second\r\nenlarged edition. --KARL VON RAUMER, translated in Barnard’s Journal of\r\nEducation, v. 260.\r\n\r\nThe “Janua” had an enormous sale, and was published in many languages,\r\nbut the editions and sale of the “Orbis Pictus” far exceeded those of\r\nthe “Janua,” and, indeed, for some time it was the most popular\r\ntext-book in Europe, and deservedly so. --LAURIE’S JOHN AMOS COMENIUS,\r\nBoston edition, p. 185.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Joh.

It will be _true_, if nothing be taught but such as is beneficial to\r\nones life; lest there be a cause of complaining afterwards. We know not\r\nnecessary things, because we have not learned things necessary.\r\n\r\n2. It will be _full_, if the mind be polished for wisdom, the tongue for\r\neloquence, and the hands for a neat way of living. This will be that\r\n_grace_ of one’s life, _to be wise, to act, to speak_.\r\n\r\n3, 4. It will be _clear_, and by that, firm and _solid_, if whatever is\r\ntaught and learned, be not obscure, or confused, but apparent, distinct,\r\nand articulate, as the fingers on the hands.\r\n\r\nThe ground of this business, is, that sensual objects may be rightly\r\npresented to the senses, for fear they may not be received. I say, and\r\nsay it again aloud, that this last is the foundation of all the rest:\r\nbecause we can neither act nor speak wisely, unless we first rightly\r\nunderstand all the things which are to be done, and whereof we are to\r\nspeak. Now there is nothing in the understanding, which was not before\r\nin the sense. And therefore to exercise the senses well about the right\r\nperceiving the differences of things, will be to lay the grounds for all\r\nwisdom, and all wise discourse, and all discreet actions in ones course\r\nof life. Which, because it is commonly neglected in schools, and the\r\nthings which are to be learned are offered to scholars, without being\r\nunderstood or being rightly presented to the senses, it cometh to pass,\r\nthat the work of teaching and learning goeth heavily onward, and\r\naffordeth little benefit.\r\n\r\nSee here then a new help for schools, A Picture and Nomenclature of all\r\nthe chief things in the world, and of men’s actions in their way of\r\nliving: Which, that you, good Masters, may not be loath to run over with\r\nyour scholars, I will tell you, in short, what good you may expect from\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIt is _a little Book_, as you see, of no great bulk, yet a brief of the\r\nwhole world, and a whole language: full of Pictures, Nomenclatures, and\r\nDescriptions of things.\r\n\r\nI. _The Pictures_ are the representation of all visible things, (to\r\nwhich also things invisible are reduced after their fashion) of the\r\nwhole world. And that in that very order of things, in which they are\r\ndescribed in the _Janua Latinæ Linguæ_; and with that fulness, that\r\nnothing very necessary or of great concernment is omitted.\r\n\r\nII. _The Nomenclatures_ are the Inscriptions, or Titles set every one\r\nover their own Pictures, expressing the whole thing by its own general\r\nterm.\r\n\r\nIII. _The Descriptions_ are the explications of the parts of the\r\nPicture, so expressed by their own proper terms, as that same figure\r\nwhich is added to every piece of the picture, and the term of it, always\r\nsheweth what things belongeth one to another.\r\n\r\nWhich such Book, and in such a dress may (I hope) serve,\r\n\r\nI. To entice witty children to it, that they may not conceit a torment\r\nto be in the school, but dainty fare. For it is apparent, that children\r\n(even from their infancy almost) are delighted with Pictures, and\r\nwillingly please their eyes with these lights: And it will be very well\r\nworth the pains to have once brought it to pass, that scare-crows may be\r\ntaken away out of Wisdom’s Gardens.\r\n\r\nII. This same little Book will serve to stir up the Attention, which is\r\nto be fastened upon things, and even to be sharpened more and more:\r\nwhich is also a great matter. For the Senses (being the main guides of\r\nchildhood, because therein the mind doth not as yet raise up itself to\r\nan abstracted contemplation of things) evermore seek their own objects,\r\nand if they be away, they grow dull, and wry themselves hither and\r\nthither out of a weariness of themselves: but when their objects are\r\npresent, they grow merry, wax lively, and willingly suffer themselves to\r\nbe fastened upon them, till the thing be sufficiently discerned. This\r\nBook then will do a good piece of service in taking (especially\r\nflickering) wits, and preparing them for deeper studies.\r\n\r\nIII. Whence a third good will follow; that children being won hereunto,\r\nand drawn over with this way of heeding, may be furnished with the\r\nknowledge of the prime things that are in the world, by sport and merry\r\npastime. In a word, this Book will serve for the more pleasing using of\r\nthe _Vestibulum_ and _Janua Linguarum_, for which end it was even at the\r\nfirst chiefly intended. Yet if it like any, that it be bound up in their\r\nnative tongues also, it promiseth three good thing of itself.\r\n\r\nI. First it will afford a device for learning to read more easily than\r\nhitherto, especially having a symbolical alphabet set before it, to wit,\r\nthe characters of the several letters, with the image of that creature,\r\nwhose voice that letter goeth about to imitate, pictur’d by it. For the\r\nyoung _Abc_ scholar will easily remember the force of every character by\r\nthe very looking upon the creature, till the imagination being\r\nstrengthened by use, can readily afford all things; and then having\r\nlooked over a _table of the chief syllables_ also (which yet was not\r\nthought necessary to be added to this book) he may proceed to the\r\nviewing of the Pictures, and the inscriptions set over ’em. Where again\r\nthe very looking upon the thing pictured suggesting the name of the\r\nthing, will tell him how the title of the picture is to be read. And\r\nthus the whole book being gone over by the bare titles of the pictures,\r\nreading cannot but be learned; and indeed too, which thing is to be\r\nnoted, without using any ordinary tedious spelling, that most\r\ntroublesome torture of wits, which may wholly be avoided by this method.\r\nFor the often reading over the Book, by those larger descriptions of\r\nthings, and which are set after the Pictures, will be able perfectly to\r\nbeget a habit of reading.\r\n\r\nII. The same book being used in English, in English Schools, will serve\r\nfor the perfect learning of the whole English tongue, and that from the\r\nbottom; because by the aforesaid descriptions of things, the words and\r\nphrases of the whole language are found set orderly in their own places.\r\nAnd a short English Grammar might be added at the end, clearly resolving\r\nthe speech already understood into its parts; shewing the declining of\r\nthe several words, and reducing those that are joined together under\r\ncertain rules.\r\n\r\nIII. Thence a new benefit cometh, that that very English Translation may\r\nserve for the more ready and pleasant learning of the Latin tongue: as\r\none may see in this Edition, the whole book being so translated, that\r\nevery where one word answereth to the word over against it, and the book\r\nis in all things the same, only in two idioms, as a man clad in a double\r\ngarment. And there might be also some observations and advertisements\r\nadded in the end, touching those things only, wherein the use of the\r\nLatin tongue differeth from the English. For where there is no\r\ndifference, there needeth no advertisement to be given. But, because the\r\nfirst _tasks of learners ought to be little and single_, we have filled\r\nthis first book of training one up to see a thing of himself, with\r\nnothing but rudiments, that is, with the chief of things and words, or\r\nwith the grounds of the whole world, and the whole language, and of all\r\nour understanding about things. If a more perfect description of things,\r\nand a fuller knowledge of a language, and a clearer light of the\r\nunderstanding be sought after (as they ought to be) they are to be found\r\nsomewhere whither there will now be an easy passage by this our _little\r\nEncyclopædia_ of things subject to the senses. Something remaineth to be\r\nsaid touching the more chearful use of this book.\r\n\r\nI. Let it be given to children into their hands to delight themselves\r\nwithal as they please, with the sight of the pictures, and making them\r\nas familiar to themselves as may be, and that even at home before they\r\nbe put to school.\r\n\r\nII. Then let them be examined ever and anon (especially now in the\r\nschool) what this thing or that thing is, and is called, so that they\r\nmay see nothing which they know not how to name, and that they can name\r\nnothing which they cannot shew.\r\n\r\nIII. And let the things named them be shewed, not only in the Picture,\r\nbut also in themselves; for example, the parts of the body, clothes,\r\nbooks, the house, utensils, &c.\r\n\r\nIV. Let them be suffered also to imitate the Pictures by hand, if they\r\nwill, nay rather, let them be encouraged, that they may be willing:\r\nfirst, thus to quicken the attention also towards the things; and to\r\nobserve the proportion of the parts one towards another; and lastly to\r\npractise the nimbleness of the hand, which is good for many things.\r\n\r\nV. If anything here mentioned, cannot be presented to the eye, it will\r\nbe to no purpose at all to offer them by themselves to the scholars; as\r\ncolours, relishes, &c., which cannot here be pictured out with ink. For\r\nwhich reason it were to be wished, that things rare and not easy to be\r\nmet withal at home, might be kept ready in every great school, that they\r\nmay be shewed also, as often as any words are to be made of them, to the\r\nscholars.\r\n\r\nThus at last this school would indeed become a school of things obvious\r\nto the senses, and an entrance to the school intellectual. But enough:\r\nLet us come to the thing it self.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRANSLATOR, TO ALL JUDICIOUS AND INDUSTRIOUS SCHOOL-MASTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nGentlemen.\r\n\r\nThere are a few of you (I think) but have seen, and with great\r\nwillingness made use of (or at least perused,) many of the Books of this\r\nwell-deserving Author Mr. John Comenius, which for their profitableness\r\nto the speedy attainment of a language, have been translated in several\r\ncountries, out of Latin into their own native tongue.\r\n\r\nNow the general verdict (after trial made) that hath passed, touching\r\nthose formerly extant, is this, that they are indeed of singular use,\r\nand very advantageous to those of more discretion, (especially to such\r\nas already have a smattering of Latin) to help their memories to retain\r\nwhat they have scatteringly gotten here and there, to furnish them with\r\nmany words, which (perhaps) they had not formerly read, or so well\r\nobserved; but to young children (whom we have chiefly to instruct) as\r\nthose that are ignorant altogether of things and words, and prove rather\r\na meer toil and burthen, than a delight and furtherance.\r\n\r\nFor to pack up many words in memory, of things not conceived in the\r\nmind, is to fill the head with empty imaginations, and to make the\r\nlearner more to admire the multitude and variety (and thereby, to become\r\ndiscouraged,) than to care to treasure them up, in hopes to gain more\r\nknowledge of what they mean.\r\n\r\nHe hath therefore in some of his latter works seemed to move retrograde,\r\nand striven to come nearer the reach of tender wits: and in this present\r\nBook, he hath, according to my judgment, descended to the very bottom of\r\nwhat is to be taught, and proceeded (as nature it self doth) in an\r\norderly way; first to exercise the senses well, by representing their\r\nobjects to them, and then to fasten upon the intellect by impressing the\r\nfirst notions of things upon it, and linking them on to another by a\r\nrational discourse. Whereas indeed, we, generally missing this way, do\r\nteach children as we do parrots, to speak they know not what, nay which\r\nis worse, we, taking the way of teaching little ones by Grammar only at\r\nthe first, do puzzle their imaginations with abstractive terms and\r\nsecondary intentions, which till they be somewhat acquainted with\r\nthings, and the words belonging to them, in the language which they\r\nlearn, they cannot apprehend what they mean. And this I guess to be the\r\nreason, why many great persons do resolve sometimes not to put a child\r\nto school till he be at least eleven or twelve years of age, presuming\r\nthat he having then taken notice of most things, will sooner get the\r\nknowledge of the words which are applyed to them in any language. But\r\nthe gross misdemeanor of such children for the most part, have taught\r\nmany parents to be hasty enough to send their own to school, if not that\r\nthey may learn, yet (at least) that they might be kept out of harm’s\r\nway; and yet if they do not profit for the time they have been at\r\nschool, (no respect at all being had for their years) the Master shall\r\nbe sure enough to bear the blame.\r\n\r\nSo that a School-master had need to bend his wits to come within the\r\ncompass of a child’s capacity of six or seven years of age (seeing we\r\nhave now such commonly brought to our Grammar-schools to learn the Latin\r\nTongue) and to make that they may learn with as much delight and\r\nwillingness, as himself would teach with dexterity and ease. And at\r\npresent I know no better help to forward his young scholars than this\r\nlittle Book, which was for this purpose contrived by the Author in the\r\nGerman and Latin Tongues.\r\n\r\nWhat profitable use may be had thereof, respecting chiefly that his own\r\ncountry and language, he himself hath told you in his preface; but what\r\nuse we may here make of it in our Grammar-schools, as it is now\r\ntranslated into English, I shall partly declare; leaving all other men,\r\naccording to my wont, to their own discretion and liberty, to use or\r\nrefuse it, as they please. So soon then as a child can read English\r\nperfectly, and is brought to us to school to learn Latin, I would have\r\nhim together with his Accidence, to be provided of this Book, in which\r\nhe may at least once a day (beside his Accidence) be thus exercised.\r\n\r\nI. Let him look over the pictures with their general titles and\r\ninscriptions, till he be able to turn readily to any one of them, and to\r\ntell its name either in English or Latin. By this means he shall have\r\nthe method of the Book in his head; and be easily furnished with the\r\nknowledge of most things; and instructed how to call them, when at any\r\ntime he meeteth with them elsewhere, in their real forms.\r\n\r\nII. Let him read the description at large: First in English, and\r\nafterward in Latin, till he can readily read, and distinctly pronounce\r\nthe words in both Languages, ever minding how they are spelled. And\r\nwithal, let him take notice of the figures inserted, and to what part of\r\nthe picture they direct by their like till he be well able to find out\r\nevery particular thing of himself, and to name it on a sudden, either in\r\nEnglish or Latin. Thus he shall not only gain the most primitive words,\r\nbut be understandingly grounded in Orthography, which is a thing too\r\ngenerally neglected by us; partly because our English schools think that\r\nchildren should learn it at the Latin, and our Latin schools suppose\r\nthey have already learn’d it at the English; partly, because our common\r\nGrammar is too much defective in this part, and scholars so little\r\nexercised therein, that they pass from schools to the Universities and\r\nreturn from thence (some of them) more unable to write true English,\r\nthan either Latin or Greek. Not to speak of our ordinary Tradesmen, many\r\nof whom write such false English, that none but themselves can interpret\r\nwhat they scribble in their bills and shop-books.\r\n\r\nIII. Then let him get the Titles and Descriptions by heart, which he\r\nwill more easily do, by reason of these impressions which the viewing of\r\nthe pictures hath already made in his memory. And now let him also\r\nlearn, 1. To construe, or give the words one by one, as they answer one\r\nanother in Latin and English. 2. To Parse, according to the rules,\r\n(which I presume by this time) he hath learn’d in the first part of his\r\nAccidence; where I would have him tell what part of Speech any word is,\r\nand then what accidents belong to it; but especially to decline the\r\nnouns and conjugate the verbs according to the Examples in his\r\nRudiments; and this doing will enable him to know the end and use of his\r\nAccidence. As for the Rules of Genders of Nouns, and the\r\nPræter-perfect-tenses and Supines of Verbs, and those of Concordance and\r\nConstruction in the latter part of the Accidence, I would not have a\r\nchild much troubled with them, till by the help of this Book he can\r\nperfectly practise so much of Etymology, as concerns the first part of\r\nhis Accidence only. For that, and this book together, being thoroughly\r\nlearn’d by at least thrice going them over, will much prepare children\r\nto go chearfully forward in their Grammar and School-Authors,\r\nespecially, if whilst they are employed herein, they be taught also to\r\nwrite a fair and legible hand.\r\n\r\nThere is one thing to be given notice of, which I wish could have been\r\nremedied in this Translation; that the Book being writ in high-Dutch\r\ndoth express many things in reference to that Country and Speech, which\r\ncannot without alteration of some Pictures as well as words be expressed\r\nin ours: for the Symbolical Alphabet is fitted for German children\r\nrather than for ours. And whereas the words of that Language go orderly\r\none for one with the Latin, our English propriety of Speech will not\r\nadmit the like. Therefore it will behove those Masters that intend to\r\nmake use of this Book, to construe it verbatim to their young Scholars,\r\nwho will quickly learn to do it of themselves, after they be once\r\nacquainted with the first words of Nouns, and Verbs, and their manner of\r\nvariation.\r\n\r\nSuch a work as this, I observe to have been formerly much desired by\r\nsome experienced Teachers, and I my self had some years since (whilst my\r\nown Child lived) begun the like, having found it most agreeable to the\r\nbest witted Children, who are most taken up with Pictures from their\r\nInfancy, because by them the knowledge of things which they seem to\r\nrepresent (and whereof Children are as yet ignorant) are most easily\r\nconveyed to the Understanding. But for as much as the work is now done,\r\nthough in some things not so completely as it were to be wished, I\r\nrejoyce in the use of it, and desist in my own undertakings for the\r\npresent. And because any good thing is the better, being the more\r\ncommunicated; I have herein imitated a Child who is forward to impart to\r\nothers what himself has well liked. You then that have the care of\r\nlittle Children, do not much trouble their thoughts and clog their\r\nmemories with bare Grammar Rudiments, which to them are harsh in\r\ngetting, and fluid in retaining; because indeed to them they signifie\r\nnothing, but a mere swimming notion of a general term, which they know\r\nnot what it meaneth, till they comprehend particulars, but by this or\r\nthe like subsidiary, inform them, first with some knowledge of things\r\nand words wherewith to express them, and then their Rules of speaking\r\nwill be better understood and more firmly kept in mind. Else how should\r\na Child conceive what a Rule meaneth, when he neither knoweth what the\r\nLatin word importeth, nor what manner of thing it is which is signified\r\nto him in his own native Language, which is given him thereby to\r\nunderstand the Rule? For Rules consisting of generalities, are delivered\r\n(as I may say) at a third hand, presuming first the things, and then the\r\nwords to be already apprehended touching which they are made. I might\r\nindeed enlarge upon this Subject, it being the very Basis of our\r\nProfession, to search into the way of Childrens taking hold by little\r\nand little of what we teach them, that so we may apply ourselves to\r\ntheir reach: But I leave the observation thereof to your own daily\r\nexercise, and experience got thereby.\r\n\r\nAnd I pray God, the fountain and giver of all wisdom, that hath bestowed\r\nupon us this gift of Teaching, so to inspire and direct us by his Grace,\r\nthat we may train up Children in his Fear and in the knowledge of his\r\nSon Jesus Christ our Lord; and then no doubt our teaching and their\r\nlearning of other things subordinate to these, will by the assistance of\r\nhis blessed Spirit make them able and willing to do him faithful Service\r\nboth in Church and Commonwealth, as long as they live here, that so they\r\nmay be eternally blessed with him hereafter. This, I beseech you, beg\r\nfor me and mine, as I shall daily do for you and yours, at the throne of\r\nGod’s heavenly grace; and remain while I live\r\n\r\nReady to serve you, as I truly love and honour you, and labour willingly\r\nin the same Profession with you,\r\n\r\nCHARLES HOOLE.\r\n\r\nFrom my School, in\r\n\r\n  _Lothbury, London, Jan. 25, 1658_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_N.B._ Those Heads or Descriptions which concern things beyond the\r\npresent apprehension of Children’s wits, as, those of Geography,\r\nAstronomy, or the like, I would have omitted, till the rest be learned,\r\nand a Child be _better able to understand them_.\r\n\r\n_The Judgment of Mr. _Hezekiah Woodward_, sometimes an _eminent\r\nSchoolmaster in LONDON_, touching a work of this Nature; in his _Gate to\r\nScience_, chap. 2._\r\n\r\nCertainly _the use of Images or Representations is great_: If we could\r\nmake our words as legible to Children as Pictures are, their information\r\ntherefrom would be quickned and surer. But so we cannot do, though we\r\nmust do what we can. And if we had Books, wherein are the Pictures of\r\nall Creatures, Herbs, Beasts, Fish, Fowls, they would stand us in great\r\nstead. For Pictures are the most intelligible Books that Children can\r\nlook upon. They come closest to Nature, nay, saith Scaliger, Art exceeds\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ADVERTISEMENT CONCERNING THIS EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs there are some considerable Alterations in the present Edition of\r\nthis Book from the former, it may be expected an Account should be given\r\nof the Reasons for them. ’Tis certain from the Author’s Words, that when\r\nit was first published, which was in Latin and Hungary, or in Latin and\r\nHigh-Dutch; every where one word answer’d to another over-against it:\r\nThis might have been observ’d in our English Translation, which wou’d\r\nhave fully answer’d the design of COMENIUS, and have made the Book much\r\nmore useful: But Mr. Hoole, (whether out of too much scrupulousness to\r\ndisturb the Words in some places from the order they were in, or not\r\nsufficiently considering the Inconveniences of having the Latin and\r\nEnglish so far asunder) has made them so much disagree, that a Boy has\r\nsometimes to seek 7 or 8 lines off for the corresponding Word; which is\r\nno small trouble to Young Learners who are at first equally unacquainted\r\nwith all Words, in a Language they are strangers to, except it be such\r\nas have Figures of Reference, or are very like in sound; and thus may\r\nperhaps, innocently enough join an Adverb in one Tongue, to a Noun in\r\nthe other; whence may appear the Necessity of the Translation’s being\r\nexactly literal, and the two Languages fairly answering one another,\r\nLine for Line.\r\n\r\nIf it be objected, such a thing cou’d not be done (considering the\r\ndifference of the Idioms) without transplacing Words here and there, and\r\nputting them into an order which may not perhaps be exactly classical;\r\nit ought to be observed, this is design’d for Boys chiefly, or those who\r\nare just entering upon the Latin Tongue, to whom every thing ought to be\r\nmade as plain and familiar as possible, who are not, at their first\r\nbeginning, to be taught the elegant placing of Latin, nor from such\r\nshort Sentences as these, but from Discourses where the Periods have a\r\nfuller Close. Besides, this way has already taken (according to the\r\nAdvice of very good Judges,) in some other School-Books of Mr. Hoole’s\r\ntranslating, and found to succeed abundantly well.\r\n\r\nSuch Condescensions as these, to the capacities of young Learners are\r\ncertainly very reasonable, and wou’d be most agreeable to the Intentions\r\nof the Ingenious and worthy Author, and his design to suit whatever he\r\ntaught, to their manner of apprehending it. Whose Excellency in the art\r\nof Education made him so famous all over Europe, as to be solicited by\r\nseveral States and Princes to go and reform the Method of their Schools;\r\nand whose works carried that Esteem, that in his own Life-time some part\r\nof them were not only translated into 12 of the usual Languages of\r\nEurope, but also into the _Arabic_, _Turkish_, _Persian_, and _Mogolic_\r\n(the common Tongue of all that part of the _East-Indies_) and since his\r\ndeath, into the _Hebrew_, and some others. Nor did they want their due\r\nEncouragement here in _England_, some Years ago; ’till by an indiscreet\r\nuse of them, and want of a thorow acquaintance with his Method, or\r\nunwillingness to part from their old road, they began to be almost quite\r\nleft off: Yet it were heartily to be wish’d, some Persons of Judgment\r\nand Interest, whose Example might have an influence upon others, and\r\nbring them into Reputation again, wou’d revive the COMENIAN METHOD,\r\nwhich is no other, than to make our Scholars learn with Delight and\r\nchearfulness, and to convey a solid and useful Knowledge of Things, with\r\nthat of Languages, in an easy, natural and familiar way. _Didactic\r\nWorks_ (as they are now collected into one volume) for a speedy\r\nattaining the Knowledge of Things and Words, join’d with the Discourses\r\nof Mr. Lock[A] and 2 or 3 more out of our own Nation, for forming the\r\nMind and settling good Habits, may doubtless be look’d upon to contain\r\nthe most reasonable, orderly, and completed System of the Art of\r\nEducation, that can be met with.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Mr. Lock’s Essay upon Education.\r\n\r\nDr. Tabor’s Christian Schoolmaster.\r\n\r\nDr. Ob. Walker of Education.\r\n\r\nMr. Monro’s Essay on Education.\r\n\r\n--His just Measures of the pious Institutions of Youth, &c.]\r\n\r\nYet, alas! how few are there, who follow the way they have pointed out?\r\ntho’ every one who seriously considers it, must be convinc’d of the\r\nAdvantage; and the generality of Schools go on in the same old dull\r\nroad, wherein a great part of Children’s time is lost in a tiresome\r\nheaping up a Pack of dry and unprofitable, or pernicious Notions (for\r\nsurely little better can be said of a great part of that Heathenish\r\nstuff they are tormented with; like the feeding them with hard Nuts,\r\nwhich when they have almost broke their teeth with cracking, they find\r\neither deaf or to contain but very rotten and unwholesome Kernels)\r\nwhilst Things really perfected of the understanding, and useful in every\r\nstate of Life, are left unregarded, to the Reproach of our Nation, where\r\nall other Arts are improved and flourish well, only this of Education of\r\nYouth is at a stand; as if that, the good or ill management of which is\r\nof the utmost consequence to all, were a thing not worth any Endeavors\r\nto improve it, or was already so perfect and well executed that it\r\nneeded none, when many of the greatest Wisdom and Judgment in several\r\nNations, have with a just indignation endeavor’d to expose it, and to\r\nestablish a more easy and useful way in its room.\r\n\r\n’Tis not easy to say little on so important a subject, but thus much may\r\nsuffice for the present purpose. The Book has merit enough to recommend\r\nit self to those who know how to make a right use of it. It was reckon’d\r\none of the Author’s best performances; and besides the many Impressions\r\nand Translations it has had in parts beyond Sea, has been several times\r\nreprinted here. It was endeavor’d no needless Alterations shou’d be\r\nadmitted in this Edition, and as little of any as cou’d consist with the\r\ndesign of making it plain and useful; to shun the offence it might give\r\nto some; and only the Roman and Italic Character alternately made use\r\nof, where transplacing of Words cou’d be avoided.\r\n\r\nJ.
