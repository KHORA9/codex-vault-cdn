Caius Cornelius Tacitus, the Historian, was living under those\r\nEmperors, who reigned from the year 54 to the year 117, of the Christian\r\nera; but the place and the date of his birth are alike uncertain, and\r\nthe time of his death is not accurately known. He was a friend of the\r\nyounger Pliny, who was born in the year 61; and, it is possible,\r\nthey were about the same age. Some of Pliny's letters were written to\r\nTacitus: the most famous, describes that eruption of Mount Vesuvius,\r\nwhich caused the death of old Pliny, and overwhelmed the cities of\r\nPompeii and of Herculaneum. The public life of Tacitus began under\r\nVespasian; and, therefore, he must have witnessed some part of the reign\r\nof Nero: and we read in him, too, that he was alive after the accession\r\nof the Emperor Trajan. In the year 77, Julius Agricola, then Consul,\r\nbetrothed his daughter to Tacitus; and they were married in the\r\nfollowing year. In 88, Tacitus was Praetor; and at the Secular Games of\r\nDomitian, he was one of the _Quindecimviri_: these were sad and solemn\r\nofficers, guardians of the Sibylline Verse; and intercessors for the\r\nRoman People, during their grave centenaries of praise and worship.\r\n\r\n  _Quaeque Aventinum tenet Algidumque,\r\n  Quindecim Diana preces virorum\r\n  Curet; et vobis pueorum amicas\r\n            Applicet aures._\r\n\r\nFrom a passage in \"The Life of Agricola,\" we may believe that Tacitus\r\nattended in the Senate; for he accuses himself as one of that frightened\r\nassembly, which was an unwilling participator in the cruelties of\r\nDomitian. In the year 97, when the Consul Virginius Rufus died, Tacitus'\r\nwas made _Consul Suffectus_; and he delivered the funeral oration of his\r\npredecessor: Pliny says, that \"it completed the good fortune of Rufus,\r\nto have his panegyric spoken by so eloquent a man.\" From this, and from\r\nother sayings, we learn that Tacitus was a famous advocate; and his\r\n\"Dialogue about Illustrious Orators\" bears witness to his admirable\r\ntaste, and to his practical knowledge of Roman eloquence: of his own\r\norations, however, not a single fragment has been left. We know not,\r\nwhether Tacitus had children; but the Emperor Tacitus, who reigned in\r\n275, traced his genealogy to the Historian. \"If we can prefer personal\r\nmerit to accidental greatness,\" Gibbon here observes, \"we shall esteem\r\nthe birth of Tacitus more truly noble than that of Kings. He claimed his\r\ndescent from the philosophic historian, whose writings will instruct the\r\nlast generations of mankind. From the assiduous study of his immortal\r\nancestor, he derived his knowledge of the Roman Constitution and of\r\nhuman nature.\" This Emperor gave orders, that the writings of Tacitus\r\nshould be placed in all the public libraries; and that ten copies should\r\nbe taken annually, at the public charge. Notwithstanding the Imperial\r\nanxiety, a valuable part of Tacitus is lost: indeed we might argue, from\r\nthe solicitude of the Emperor, as well as from his own \"distinction,\"\r\nthat Tacitus could not be generally popular; and, in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, a great portion of him was reduced to the single manuscript,\r\nwhich lay hidden within a German monastery. Of his literary works, five\r\nremain; some fairly complete, the rest in fragments. Complete, are \"The\r\nLife of Julius Agricola,\" \"The Dialogue on Orators,\" and \"The Account\r\nof Germany\": these are, unfortunately, the minor works of Tacitus. His\r\nlarger works are \"The History,\" and \"The Annals.\" \"The History\" extended\r\nfrom the second Consulship of Galba, in the year 69, to the murder of\r\nDomitian, in the year 96; and Tacitus desired to write the happy times\r\nof Nerva, and of Trajan: we are ignorant, whether infirmity or death\r\nprevented his design. Of \"The History,\" only four books have been\r\npreserved; and they contain the events of a single year: a year, it is\r\ntrue, which, saw three civil wars, and four Emperors destroyed; a year\r\nof crime, and accidents, and prodigies: there are few sentences more\r\npowerful, than Tacitus' enumeration of these calamities, in the opening\r\nchapters. The fifth book is imperfect; it is of more than common\r\ninterest to some people, because Tacitus mentions the siege of Jerusalem\r\nby Titus; though what he says about the Chosen People, here and\r\nelsewhere, cannot be satisfactory to them nor gratifying to their\r\nadmirers. With this fragment, about revolts in the provinces of Gaul\r\nand Syria, \"The History\" ends. \"The Annals\" begin with the death of\r\nAugustus, in the year 14; and they were continued until the death of\r\nNero, in 68. The reign of Tiberius is nearly perfect, though the fall\r\nof Sejanus is missing out of it. The whole of Caligula, the beginning of\r\nClaudius, and the end of Nero, have been destroyed: to those, who know\r\nthe style of Tacitus and the lives and genius of Caligula and Nero, the\r\nloss is irreparable; and the admirers of Juvenal must always regret,\r\nthat from the hand of Tacitus we have only the closing scene, and not\r\nthe golden prime, of Messalina.\r\n\r\nThe works of Tacitus are too great for a Camelot volume; and, therefore,\r\nI have undertaken a selection of them. I give entire, \"The Account of\r\nGermany\" and \"The Life of Agricola\": these works are entertaining, and\r\nshould have a particular interest for English readers. I have added to\r\nthem, the greater portion of the first six books of \"The Annals\"; and\r\nI have endeavoured so to guide my choice, that it shall present the\r\nhistory of Tiberius. In this my volume, the chapters are not numbered:\r\nfor the omission, I am not responsible; and I can only lament, what I\r\nmay not control. But scholars, who know their Tacitus, will perceive\r\nwhat I have left out; and to those others, who are not familiar with\r\nhim, the omission can be no affront. I would say briefly, that I\r\nhave omitted some chapters, which describe criminal events and legal\r\ntragedies in Rome: but of these, I have retained every chapter, which\r\npreserves an action or a saying of Tiberius; and what I have inserted\r\nis a sufficient specimen of the remainder. I have omitted many chapters,\r\nwhich are occupied with wearisome disputes between the Royal Houses\r\nof Parthia and Armenia: and I have spared my readers the history of\r\nTacfarinas, an obscure and tedious rebel among the Moors; upon whose\r\nintricate proceedings Tacitus appears to have relied, when he was at a\r\nloss for better material. To reject any part of Tacitus, is a painful\r\nduty; because the whole of him is good and valuable: but I trust, that I\r\nhave maintained the unity of my selection, by remembering that it is to\r\nbe an history of Tiberius.\r\n\r\nTiberius Claudius Nero Caesar, the third master of the Roman world,\r\nderived his origin, by either parent, from the Claudian race; the\r\nproudest family, and one of the most noble and illustrious, in the\r\nancient Commonwealth: the pages of Livy exhibit the generosity, the\r\nheroism, and the disasters, of the Claudii; who were of unequal fortune\r\nindeed, but always magnificent, in the various events of peace and\r\nwar. Suetonius enumerates, among their ancestral honours, twenty-eight\r\nConsulships, five Dictators, seven Censorial commissions, and seven\r\ntriumphs: their _cognomen_ of Nero, he says, means in the Sabine tongue\r\n\"vigorous and bold,\" _fortis et strenuus_; and the long history of the\r\nClaudian House does not belie their gallant name. Immediately after the\r\nbirth of Tiberius, or perhaps before it, his mother Livia was divorced\r\nfrom Claudius, and married by Augustus: the Empress is revealed\r\nmysteriously and almost as a divine being, in the progress of \"The\r\nAnnals.\" The Emperor adopted the offspring of Claudius: among the\r\nRomans, these legal adoptions were as valid as descent by blood; and\r\nTiberius was brought up to be the son of Caesar. His natural parts were\r\nimproved and strengthened, by the training of the Forum and the camp.\r\nTiberius became a good orator; and he gained victory and reputation, in\r\nhis wars against the savages of Germany and Dalmatia: but his peculiar\r\ntalent was for literature; in this, \"he was a great purist, and affected\r\na wonderful precision about his words.\" He composed some Greek poems,\r\nand a Latin Elegy upon Lucius Caesar: he also wrote an account of his\r\nown life, an _Apologia_; a volume, which the Emperor Domitian was\r\nnever tired of reading. But the favourite pursuit of Tiberius was Greek\r\ndivinity; like some of the mediaeval Doctors, he frequented the by-ways\r\nof religion, and amused his leisure with the more difficult problems in\r\ntheology: \"Who was Hecuba's mother?\" \"What poetry the Sirens chaunted?\"\r\n\"What was Achilles' name, when he lay hid among the women?\" The writings\r\nof Tiberius have all perished; and in these days, we have only too much\r\ncause to regret, that nothing of his \"precision\" has come down to us.\r\nThe battles of Tiberius are celebrated in the Odes of Horace: one of the\r\nEpistles is addressed to him; and in another, written to Julius Florus,\r\nan officer with Tiberius, Horace enquires about the learned occupations\r\nof the Imperial cohort.\r\n\r\n  _Quid studiosa Cohors operum struit?  Hoc quoque curo._\r\n\r\nIt was from his commerce with the Ancients, as I always think, that\r\nGeorge Buchanan derived his opinion, strange to modern ears, that \"a\r\ngreat commander must of necessity have all the talents of an author.\"\r\nVelleius Paterculus, who served with Tiberius in his campaigns, tells us\r\nof his firm discipline, and of his kindness to the soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe Caesars Caius and Lucius, grandsons of Augustus, Marcellus his\r\nnephew, and Drusus the brother of Tiberius, all died: they died young,\r\nrich in promise, the darlings of the Roman People; \"Breves et infaustos\r\nPopuli Romani amores;\" and thus, in the procession of events, Tiberius\r\nbecame the heir. \"The Annals\" open with his accession, and Tacitus has\r\nnarrated the vicissitudes of his reign. Velleius Paterculus has written\r\nits happier aspects: he describes how the \"Pax Augusta,\" the \"Roman\r\nPeace,\" delivered every quarter of the world from violence. He\r\ncelebrates the return of Justice and prosperity, of order, of mild and\r\nequable taxation, of military discipline and magisterial authority. It\r\nis like the Saturnian Reign, which Virgil sings in the Eclogue \"Pollio.\"\r\nThe first action of Tiberius was to canonise his father, and Augustus\r\nwas translated to the banquet of the Gods:\r\n\r\n  _Quos inter Augustus recumbens,\r\n  Purpureo bibit ore nectar._\r\n\r\nAugustus was his great example; \"he not only called him, but considered\r\nhim, divine;\" \"non appelavit eum, sed facit Deum.\" The Latin of\r\nPaterculus is here so elegant and happy, that, for the pleasure of the\r\nlearned, I transcribe it: for others, I have already given something\r\nof the sense. \"Revocata in forum fides; submota e foro seditio, ambitio\r\ncampo, discordia curia: sepultaeque ac situ obsitae, justitia, aequitas,\r\nindustria, civitati, redditae; accessit magistratibus auctoritas,\r\nsenatui majestas, judiciis gravitas; compressa theatralis seditio;\r\nrecte faciendi, omnibus aut incussa voluntas aut imposita necessitas.\r\nHonorantur recta, prava puniuntur. Suspicit potentem humilis, non timet.\r\nAntecedit, non contemnit, humiliorem potens. Quando annona moderatior?\r\nQuando pax laetior? Diffusa in Orientis Occidentisque tractus, quidquid\r\nmeridiano aut septentrione finitur, Pax Augusta, per omnes terrarum\r\norbis angulos metu servat immunes. Fortuita non civium tantummodo, sed\r\nUrbium damna, Principis munificentia vindicat. Restitutae urbes\r\nAsiae: vindictae ab injuriis magistratuum provinciae. Honor dignis\r\nparatissimus: poena in malos sera, sed aliqua. Superatur aequitate\r\ngratia, ambitio virtute: nam facere recte cives suos, Princeps optimus\r\nfaciendo docet; cumque sit imperio maximus, exemplo major est.\"\r\n\r\nTiberius reigned from the year 14, to the year 37. He died in the villa\r\nof Lucullus, and he was buried in the mausoleum of the Caesars. The\r\nmanner of his death is variously related: Tacitus gives one account;\r\nSuetonius, another. According to the last writer, he died like George\r\nII., alone, having just risen from his bed; and he was thus found by\r\nhis attendants: \"Seneca cum scribit subito vocatis ministris, ac nemine\r\nrespondente, consurrexisse; nec procul a lectulo, deficientibus viribus,\r\nconcidisse.\" Tiberius was tall, and beautiful. Suetonius tells us of\r\nhis great eyes, which could see in the dark; of his broad shoulders,\r\nhis martial bearing, and the fine proportion of his limbs: he describes,\r\ntoo, the unusual strength of his hands and fingers, especially of the\r\nleft hand. His health was good; because, from his thirtieth year, he\r\nwas his own physician. \"Valetudine prosperrima usus est, tempore quidem\r\nprincipatus paene toto prope illesa; quamvis a trigesimo aetatis anno\r\narbitratu eam suo rexerit, sine adjutamento consiliove medicorum.\" The\r\nEmperor Julian describes him \"severe and grim; with a statesman's care,\r\nand a soldier's frankness, curiously mingled:\" this was in his old age.\r\n\r\n  _Down the pale cheek, long lines of shadow slope;\r\n  Which years, and curious thought, and suffering give._\r\n\r\nAt Rome, is a sculpture of Tiberius; he is represented young, seated,\r\ncrowned with rays, exceedingly handsome and majestic: if the figure were\r\nnot known to be a Caesar, the beholder would say it was a God.\r\n\r\nThere is another personage in \"The Annals,\" whose history there is\r\nmutilated, and perhaps dissembled; of whose character my readers may\r\nlike to know something more, than Tacitus has told them: I mean Sejanus,\r\na man always to be remembered; because whatever judgment we may form\r\nabout his political career, and on this question the authorities are\r\ndivided, yet it is admitted by them all, that he introduced those\r\nreforms among the Praetorian Cohorts, which made them for a long time,\r\nproprietors of the throne, and the disposers of the Imperial office. To\r\nthis minister, Paterculus attributes as many virtues as he has bestowed\r\nupon Tiberius: \"a man grave and courteous,\" he says, \"with 'a fine\r\nold-fashioned grace'; leisurely in his ways, retiring, modest; appearing\r\nto be careless, and therefore gaining all his ends; outwardly polite and\r\nquiet, but an eager soul, wary, inscrutable, and vigilant.\" Whatever he\r\nmay have been in reality, he was at one time valued by Tiberius. \"The\r\nwhole Senate,\" Bacon says, \"dedicated an altar to Friendship as to a\r\nGoddess, in respect of the great Dearness of Friendship between them\r\ntwo:\" and in the Essay \"Of Friendship,\" Bacon has many deep sentences\r\nabout the favourites of Kings, their \"Participes Curarum.\" I would\r\nsummon out of \"The Annals,\" that episode of Tiberius imprisoned within\r\nthe falling cave, and shielded by Sejanus from the descending roof.\r\n\"Coelo Musa beat:\" Sejanus has propitiated no Muse; and although\r\nsomething more, than the \"invida taciturnitas\" of the poet, lies heavy\r\nupon his reputation, he shall find no apologist in me. But over against\r\nthe hard words of Tacitus, it is only fair to place the commendations\r\nof Paterculus, and even Tacitus remarks, that after the fall of Sejanus,\r\nTiberius became worse; like Henry VIII., after the fall of Wolsey. Livia\r\nand Sejanus are said by Tacitus, to have restrained the worst passions\r\nof the Emperor. The two best authorities contradict one another; they\r\ndiffer, as much as our political organs differ, about the characters of\r\nliving statesmen: and who are we, to decide absolutely, from a distance\r\nof two thousand years, at our mere caprice, and generally without\r\nsufficient evidence, that one ancient writer is correct; and another,\r\ndishonest or mistaken? This is only less absurd, than to prefer the\r\ngroping style and thoughts of a modern pedant, usually a German as\r\nwell, to the clear words of an old writer, who may be the sole remaining\r\nauthority for the statements we presume to question; or for those\r\nvery facts, upon which our reasonings depend. And how easy it is to\r\nmisunderstand what we read in ancient histories, to be deceived by the\r\nplainest records, or to put a sinister interpretation upon events, which\r\nin their own time were passed over in silence or officially explained\r\nas harmless! Let me take an illustration, of what I mean, from something\r\nrecent. Every one must remember the last hours of the Emperor Frederick:\r\nthe avenues to his palace infested by armed men; the gloom and secrecy\r\nwithin; without, an impatient heir, and the posting to and fro of\r\nmessengers. We must own, that the ceremonials of the Prussian Court\r\ndeparted in a certain measure from the ordinary mild usage of humanity;\r\nbut we attributed this to nothing more, than the excitement of a\r\nyouthful Emperor, or the irrepressible agitation of German officials.\r\nBut if these events should find a place in history, or if the annals of\r\nthe Kings of Prussia should be judged worth reading by a distant Age;\r\nwho could blame an historian for saying, that these precautions were not\r\nrequired for the peaceful and innocent devolution of the crown from a\r\nfather to his son. Would not our historian be justified, if he referred\r\nto the tumults and intrigues of a Praetorian election; if he compared\r\nthese events to the darkest pages in Suetonius, or reminded his\r\nreaders of the most criminal narratives in the authors of the \"Augustan\r\nHistory\"? From Sejanus and the Emperor William, I return once more to\r\nTiberius; from the present _Kaiser_, to a genuine Caesar.\r\n\r\nIt is not my purpose here to abridge Tacitus, to mangle his translator,\r\nnor to try and say what is better said in the body of the volume: but\r\nwhen my readers have made themselves acquainted with Tiberius, they may\r\nbe glad to find some discussion about him, as he is presented to us in\r\n\"The Annals\"; and among all the personages of history, I doubt if there\r\nbe a more various or more debated character. Mr. Matthew Arnold thus\r\ndescribes him:\r\n\r\n  _Cruel, but composed and bland,\r\n  Dumb, inscrutable and grand;\r\n  So Tiberius might have sat,\r\n  Had Tiberius been a cat._\r\n\r\nAnd these verses express the popular belief, with great felicity: I\r\nmust leave my readers, to make their own final judgment for themselves.\r\nWhether Tacitus will have helped them to a decision, I cannot guess: he\r\nseems to me, to deepen the mystery of Tiberius. At a first reading, and\r\nupon the surface, he is hostile to the Emperor; there is no doubt, that\r\nhe himself remained hostile, and that he wished his readers to take away\r\na very bad impression: but, as we become familiar with his pages, as\r\nwe ponder his words and compare his utterances, we begin to suspect our\r\nprevious judgment; another impression steals upon us, and a second, and\r\na third, until there grows imperceptibly within us a vision of something\r\ndifferent. Out of these dim and floating visions, a clearer image is\r\ngradually formed, with lineaments and features; and, at length, a\r\nnew Tiberius is created within our minds: just as we may have seen\r\na portrait emerge under the artist's hand, from the intricate and\r\nscattered lines upon an easel. Then it dawns upon us, that, after all,\r\nTacitus was not really an intimate at Capri; that he never received the\r\nsecret confidences of Tiberius, nor attended upon his diversions. And at\r\nlast it is borne in upon us, as we read, that, if we put aside rumours\r\nand uncertain gossip, whatever Tiberius does and says is unusually fine:\r\nbut that Tacitus is not satisfied with recording words and actions;\r\nthat he supplies motives to them, and then passes judgment upon his\r\nown assumptions: that the evidence for the murder of Germanicus, for\r\ninstance, would hardly be accepted in a court of law; and that if Piso\r\nwere there found guilty, the Emperor could not be touched. At any rate,\r\nwe find it stated in \"The Annals,\" that \"Tiberius by the temptations of\r\nmoney was incorruptible;\" and he refused the legacies of strangers,\r\nor of those who had natural heirs. \"He wished to restore the people to\r\nseverer manners,\" like many sovereigns; unlike the most of them, \"in his\r\nown household, he observed the ancient parsimony.\" Besides the \"severa\r\npaupertas\" of Camillus and Fabricius, he had something of their\r\nprimitive integrity; and he declined, with scorn, to be an accomplice in\r\nthe proposed assassination of Arminius: \"non fraude neque occultis, sed\r\npalam et armatum, Populum Romanum hostes suos ulcisci.\" He protected\r\nmagistrates and poor suitors, against the nobles. He refused to add to\r\nthe public burdens, by pensioning needy Senators: but he was\r\ncharitable to poor debtors; and lavish to the people, whether Romans or\r\nProvincials, in times of calamity and want. Not least admirable was his\r\nquiet dignity, in periods of disturbance and of panic: he refused to\r\nhurry to the mutinous legions, or to a mean rebellion in Gaul; and he\r\ncondescended to reason excellently about his behaviour, when his\r\npeople were sane enough to listen. He was both sensible and modest: he\r\nrestrained the worship of Augustus, \"lest through being too common\r\nit should be turned into an idle ceremony;\" he refused the worship of\r\nhimself, except in one temple dedicated equally to the Senate and to\r\nthe Emperor. Tiberius could be pathetic, too: \"I bewail my son, and ever\r\nshall bewail him,\" he says of Germanicus; and again, \"Eloquence is not\r\nmeasured by fortune, and it is a sufficient honour, if he be ranked\r\namong the ancient orators.\" \"Princes are mortal;\" he says again, \"the\r\nCommonwealth, eternal.\" Then his wit, how fine it was; how quick his\r\nhumour: when he answered the tardy condolences from Troy, by lamenting\r\nthe death of Hector: when he advised an eager candidate, \"not to\r\nembarrass his eloquence by impetuosity;\" when he said of another, a\r\nlow, conceited person, \"he gives himself the airs of a dozen ancestors,\"\r\n\"videtur mihi ex se natus:\" when he muttered in the Senate, \"O homines\r\nad servitutem paratos:\" when he refused to become a persecutor; \"It\r\nwould be much better, if the Gods were allowed to manage their own\r\naffairs,\" \"Deorum injurias Dis curae.\" In all this; in his leisured\r\nways, in his dislike of parade and ceremonial, in his mockery of\r\nflatterers and venal \"patriots\"; how like to Charles II., \"the last\r\nKing of England who was a man of parts.\" And no one will deny \"parts\"\r\nto Tiberius; he was equal to the burden of Imperial cares: the latest\r\nresearches have discovered, that his provincial administration was\r\nmost excellent; and even Tacitus admits, that his choice of magistrates\r\n\"could not have been better.\" He says, in another passage, \"The\r\nEmperor's domains throughout Italy, were thin; the behaviour of his\r\nslaves modest; the freed-men, who managed his house, few; and, in his\r\ndisputes with particulars, the courts were open and the law equal.\" This\r\nresembles the account of Antoninus Pius, by Marcus Aurelius; and it is\r\nfor this modesty, this careful separation between private and public\r\naffairs, that Tacitus has praised Agricola. I am well contented, with\r\nthe virtues of the Antonines; but there are those, who go beyond. I have\r\nseen a book entitled \"The History of that Inimitable Monarch Tiberius,\r\nwho in the xiv year of his Reign requested the Senate to permit the\r\nworship of Jesus Christ; and who suppressed all Opposition to it.\" In\r\nthis learned volume, it is proved out of the Ancients, that Tiberius was\r\nthe most perfect of all sovereigns; and he is shown to be nothing\r\nless than the forerunner of Saint Peter, the first Apostle and the\r\nnursing-father of the Christian Church. The author was a Cambridge\r\ndivine, and one of their Professors of mathematics: \"a science,\"\r\nGoldsmith says, \"to which the meanest intellects are equal.\"\r\n\r\nUpon the other hand, we have to consider that view of Tiberius, which is\r\nthus shown by Milton;\r\n\r\n  _This Emperor hath no son, and now is old;\r\n  Old and lascivious: and from Rome retired\r\n  To Capreae, an island small but strong,\r\n  On the Campanian shore; with purpose there,\r\n  His horrid lusts in private to enjoy._\r\n\r\nThis theme is enlarged by Suetonius, and evidently enjoyed: he\r\nrepresents Tiberius, as addicted to every established form of vice;\r\nand as the inventor of new names, new modes, and a new convenience, for\r\nunheard-of immoralities. These propensities of the Emperor are handled\r\nby Tacitus with more discretion, though he does not conceal them. I wish\r\nneither to condemn nor to condone Tiberius: I desire, if it be\r\npossible, to see him as he is; and whether he be good or bad, he is very\r\ninteresting. I have drawn attention to what is good in \"The Annals,\"\r\nbecause Tacitus leans with all his weight upon the bad; and either\r\nexplains away what is favourable, or passes over it with too light a\r\nstroke. At the end, I must conclude, as I began, that the character of\r\nTiberius is a mystery. It is a commonplace, that no man is entirely good\r\nnor entirely evil; but the histories of Tiberius are too contradictory,\r\nto be thus dismissed by a platitude. It is not easy to harmonise\r\nPaterculus with Suetonius: it is impossible to reconcile Tacitus with\r\nhimself; or to combine the strong, benevolent ruler with the Minotaur of\r\nCapri. The admirers of an almost perfect prose, must be familiar with a\r\nstory, which is not the highest effort of that prose: they will remember\r\na certain man with a double nature, like all of us; but, unlike us,\r\nable to separate his natures, and to personate at will his good or evil\r\ngenius. Tiberius was fond of magic, and of the curious arts: it may be,\r\nthat he commanded the secrets of which Mr. Stevenson has dreamed!\r\n\r\nThe readers of \"The Annals\" have seen enough of blood, of crime, and of\r\nTiberius; and I would now engage their attention upon a more pleasing\r\naspect of Imperial affairs: I wish to speak about the Empire itself;\r\nabout its origin, its form, its history: and, if my powers were equal to\r\nthe task, I would sketch a model Emperor; Marcus Aurelius, or the elder\r\nAntonine. Gibbon has described the limits of the Roman Empire; which\r\n\"comprised the fairest part of the earth, and the most civilised portion\r\nof mankind.\" Its boundaries were \"the Rhine and Danube, on the north;\r\nthe Euphrates, on the east; towards the south, the sandy deserts of\r\nArabia and Africa;\" and upon the west, the Atlantic ocean. It was over\r\nthis extensive monarchy, that Caesar reigned; by the providence of\r\nCaesar, was the whole defended and administered.\r\n\r\n  _Quis Parthum paveat? Quis gelidum Scythen\r\n  Quis, Germania quos horrida parturit\r\n  Fetus, incolumi Caesare?_\r\n\r\nThe frontiers of the Empire, and its richest provinces, had been\r\nobtained for the most part in the long wars of the Republic. The\r\nconquest of Gaul, and the establishment of the Empire, was achieved\r\nby Julius Caesar; and to him, the civilised world is indebted for that\r\nmajestic \"Roman Peace,\" under which it lived and prospered for nearly\r\nnineteen centuries: the Eastern Empire was maintained in Constantinople,\r\nuntil 1453; and the Empire of the West continued, though in waning\r\nsplendour, until the last Caesar abdicated his throne at the order of\r\nNapoleon. The nations of modern Europe were developed out of the ruin\r\nof Caesar's Empire; and from that, the more civilised among them have\r\nobtained the politer share of their laws, their institutions, and their\r\nlanguage: and to Caesar, we are indebted for those inestimable treasures\r\nof antiquity, which the Roman Empire and the Roman Church have preserved\r\nfrom the barbarians, and have handed on for the delight and the\r\ninstruction of modern times. There are those, who can perceive in Caesar\r\nnothing but a demagogue, and a tyrant; and in the regeneration of the\r\nCommonwealth, nothing but a vulgar crime: among these, I am sorry to\r\ninscribe the name of Thomas Gordon. The supporters of this view are\r\ngenerally misled, by the specious allurements of the term \"Republic.\"\r\nTiberius, it may be, was not a perfect ruler, and other sovereigns were\r\neven more ferocious; but the excesses of the most reckless Emperor are\r\nhardly to be compared to the wholesale massacres and spoliations,\r\nwhich attended the last agonies of the expiring Commonwealth. After\r\nthe Macedonian and Asiatic wars, we find a turbulent and servile crowd,\r\ninstead of the old families and tribes of Roman citizens; instead of\r\nallies, oppressed and plundered provinces; instead of the heroes of the\r\nyoung Republic, a set of worn-out, lewd, and greedy nobles. By these,\r\nthe spoils of the world were appropriated, and its government abused:\r\nCaesar gave the helpless peoples a legal sovereign, and preserved them\r\nfrom the lawless tyranny of a thousand masters. He narrates himself,\r\nthat \"he found the Romans enslaved by a faction, and he restored their\r\nliberty:\" \"Caesar interpellat; ut Populum Romanum, paucorum factione\r\noppressum, in libertatem vindicat.\" The march of Caesar into Italy was\r\na triumphal progress; and there can be no doubt, that the common\r\npeople received him gladly. Again he says, \"Nihil esse Rempublicam;\r\nappellationem modo, sine corpore et specie;\" \"The Republic is nothing\r\nbut an empty name, a phantom and a shadow.\" That Caesar should have seen\r\nthis, is the highest evidence of his genius: that Cicero did not see it,\r\nis to himself, and to his country, the great misfortune of his career;\r\nand to his admirers, one of the most melancholy events in Roman history.\r\nThe opinions of Tacitus were not far removed from the opinions of\r\nCicero, but they were modified by what he saw of Nerva and of Trajan:\r\nhe tells us, how Agricola looked forward to the blessings of a virtuous\r\nPrince; and his own thoughts and writings would have been other, than\r\nthey are, had he witnessed the blameless monarchy of Hadrian and the\r\nAntonines. The victims of a bad Emperor were taken usually from among\r\nthe nobles; many of them were little better, than their destroyer; and\r\nhis murders were confined, almost invariably, within the walls of Rome:\r\nbut the benefits of the Imperial system were extended into all the\r\nprovinces; and the judgment-seat of Caesar was the protection of\r\ninnumerable citizens. Many were the mistakes, many the misfortunes,\r\ndeplorable the mischiefs, of the Imperial administration; I wish neither\r\nto deny, nor to conceal them: but here I must content myself with\r\nspeaking broadly, with presenting a superficial view of things; and,\r\nupon the whole, the system of the Emperors was less bad than the decayed\r\nand inadequate government, out of which it was developed. For the\r\nchange from the Republic to the Empire was hardly a revolution; and\r\nthe venerable names and forms of the old organisation were religiously\r\npreserved. Still, the Consuls were elected, the Senate met and\r\nlegislated, Praetors and Legates went forth into the provinces, the\r\nLegions watched upon the frontiers, the lesser Magistrates performed\r\ntheir office; but above them was Caesar, directing all things,\r\ncontrolling all things; the _Imperator_ and Universal Tribune, in whose\r\nname all was done; the \"Praesens Divus,\" on whom the whole depended; at\r\nonce the master of the Imperial Commonwealth, and the minister of the\r\nRoman People.\r\n\r\n\"The Annals,\" and the history of Tiberius, have detained us, for the\r\nmost part, within the capital: \"The Agricola\" brings us into a province\r\nof the Empire; and \"The Account of Germany\" will take us among the\r\nsavages beyond the frontier. I need scarcely mention, that our country\r\nwas brought within the Roman influence by Julius Caesar; but that\r\nCaesar's enterprise was not continued by Augustus, nor by Tiberius;\r\nthough Caligula celebrated a fictitious triumph over the unconquered\r\nBritons: that a war of about forty years was undertaken by Claudius,\r\nmaintained by Nero, and terminated by Domitian; who were respectively\r\n\"the most stupid, the most dissolute, and the most timid of all the\r\nEmperors.\" It was in the British wars, that Vespasian began his great\r\ncareer, \"monstratus fatis\"; but the island was not really added to the\r\nEmpire, until Agricola subdued it for Domitian. \"The Life of Agricola\"\r\nis of general interest, because it preserves the memory of a good and\r\nnoble Roman: to us, it is of special interest, because it records the\r\nstate of Britain when it was a dependency of the Caesars; \"adjectis\r\nBritannis imperio.\" Our present fashions in history will not allow us\r\nto think, that we have much in common with those natives, whom Tacitus\r\ndescribes: but fashions change, in history as in other things; and in\r\na wiser time we may come to know, and be proud to acknowledge, that\r\nwe have derived a part of our origin, and perhaps our fairest\r\naccomplishments, from the Celtic Britons. The narrative of Tacitus\r\nrequires no explanation; and I will only bring to the memory of my\r\nreaders, Cowper's good poem on Boadicea. We have been dwelling upon the\r\nglories of the Roman Empire: it may be pardonable in us, and it is not\r\nunpleasing, to turn for a moment, I will not say to \"the too vast orb\"\r\nof our fate, but rather to that Empire which is more extensive than the\r\nRoman; and destined to be, I hope, more enduring, more united, and more\r\nprosperous. Horace will hardly speak of the Britons, as humane beings,\r\nand he was right; in his time, they were not a portion of the Roman\r\nWorld, they had no part in the benefits of the Roman government: he\r\ntalks of them, as beyond the confines of civility, \"in ultimos orbis\r\nBritannos;\" as cut off by \"the estranging sea,\" and there jubilant in\r\ntheir native practices, \"Visum Britannos hospitibus feros.\" But Cowper\r\nsays, no less truly, of a despised and rebel Queen;\r\n\r\n  _Regions Caesar never knew,\r\n  Thy posterity shall sway;\r\n  Where his Eagles never flew,\r\n  None invincible as they._\r\n\r\nThe last battles of Agricola were fought in Scotland; and, in the pages\r\nof Tacitus, he achieved a splendid victory among the Grampian hills.\r\nGibbon remarks, however, \"The native Caledonians preserved in the\r\nnorthern extremity of the island their wild independence, for which\r\nthey were not less indebted to their poverty than to their valour. Their\r\nincursions were frequently repelled and chastised; but their country was\r\nnever subdued. The masters of the fairest and most wealthy climates of\r\nthe globe turned with contempt from gloomy hills assailed by the winter\r\ntempest, from lakes concealed in a blue mist, and from cold and lonely\r\nheaths, over which the deer of the forest were chased by a troop of\r\nnaked barbarians.\" The Scotch themselves are never tired of asserting,\r\nand of celebrating, their \"independence\"; Scotland imposed a limit to\r\nthe victories of the Roman People, Scaliger says in his compliments to\r\nBuchanan:\r\n\r\n  _Imperii fuerat Romani Scotia lines._\r\n\r\nBut it may be questioned, whether it were an unmixed blessing, to\r\nbe excluded from the Empire; and to offer a sullen resistance to its\r\ninestimable gifts of humane life, of manners, and of civility.\r\n\r\nTo these things, the Germans also have manifested a strong dislike; and\r\nthey are more censurable than the Scotch, because all their knowledge of\r\nthe Romans was not derived from the intercourse of war. \"The Germany\"\r\nof Tacitus is a document, that has been much discussed; and these\r\ndiscussions may be numbered among the most flagrant examples of literary\r\nintemperance: but this will not surprise us, when we allow for the\r\nstructure of mind, the language, and the usual productions of those,\r\nto whom the treatise is naturally of the greatest importance. In the\r\ndescription of the Germans, Tacitus goes out of his way to laugh at the\r\n\"licentia vetustatis,\" \"the debauches of pedants and antiquarians;\"\r\nas though he suspected the fortunes of his volume, and the future\r\ndistinctions of the Teutonic genius. For sane readers, it will be enough\r\nto remark, that the Germany of Tacitus was limited, upon the west, by\r\nthe natural and proper boundary of the Rhine; that it embraced a portion\r\nof the Low Countries; and that, although he says it was confined within\r\nthe Danube, yet the separation is not clear between the true Germans and\r\nthose obscurer tribes, whose descendants furnish a long enumeration\r\nof titles to the present melancholy sovereign of the House of Austria.\r\nGibbon remarks, with his usual sense, \"In their primitive state of\r\nsimplicity and independence, the Germans were surveyed by the discerning\r\neye, and delineated by the masterly pencil of Tacitus, the first\r\nhistorian who supplied the science of philosophy to the study of facts.\r\nThe expressive conciseness of his descriptions has deserved to exercise\r\nthe diligence of innumerable antiquarians, and to excite the genius and\r\npenetration of the philosophic historians of our own time.\" Upon a\r\nfew sentences out of the \"Germania\"; which relate to the kings, to the\r\nholding of land, to the public assemblies, and to the army; an imposing\r\nstructure of English constitutional history has been erected: our modern\r\nhistorians look upon this treatise with singular approval; because\r\nit shows them, they say, the habits of their own forefathers in their\r\nnative settlements. They profess to be enchanted with all they read;\r\nand, in their works, they betray their descent from the ancestors they\r\nadmire. Gibbon says, prettily, \"Whenever Tacitus indulges himself in\r\nthose beautiful episodes, in which he relates some domestic transaction\r\nof the Germans or of the Parthians, his principal object is to relieve\r\nthe attention of the reader from an uniform scene of vice and misery.\"\r\nWhether he succeeds, I must leave my readers to decide. Tacitus\r\ndescribes the quarrels of the Germans; fought, then with weapons; now,\r\nwith words: their gambling, their sloth, their drunkenness. \"Strong\r\nbeer, a liquor extracted with very little art from wheat or barley,\r\nand _corrupted_ (as it is strongly expressed by Tacitus) into a certain\r\nsemblance of wine, was sufficient for the gross purposes of German\r\ndebauchery.\" Tacitus informs us, too, \"that they sleep far into the day;\r\nthat on rising they take a bath, usually of warm water; then they eat.\"\r\nTo pass an entire day and night in drinking, disgraces no one: \"Dediti\r\nsomno ciboque,\" he says; a people handed over to sloth and gluttony.\r\nSome of these customs are now almost obsolete; the baths, for instance.\r\nIn others, there has been little alteration since the Age of Tacitus;\r\nand the Germans have adhered, with obstinate fidelity, to their\r\nprimitive habits. Tacitus thought less of their capacity, upon the\r\nwhole, than it is usual to think now: \"The Chatti,\" he says, \"for\r\nGermans, have much intelligence;\" \"Leur intelligence et leur finesse\r\nétonnent, dans des Germains.\" But let us forget these \"Tedeschi lurchi,\r\nnon ragionam di lor;\" and pass on to those manly virtues, which Tacitus\r\nrecords: To abandon your shield, is the basest of crimes, \"relicta non\r\nbene parmula;\" nor may a man thus disgraced be present at their sacred\r\nrites, nor enter their council; many, indeed, after escaping from\r\nbattle, have ended their infamy with the halter. And to more shameful\r\ncrimes, they awarded a sterner punishment:\r\n\r\n  _Behind flock'd wrangling up a piteous crew\r\n  Greeted of none, disfeatured and forlorn:\r\n  Cowards, who were in sloughs interr'd alive;\r\n  And round them still the wattled hurdles hung\r\n  Wherewith they stamp'd them down, and trod them deep,\r\n  To hide their shameful memory from men._\r\n\r\nHaving now surveyed the compositions in this volume, it is proper that\r\nwe should at length devote some of our notice to Gordon himself, and to\r\nhis manner of presenting Tacitus. Thomas Gordon was born in Scotland;\r\nthe date has not yet been ascertained. He is thought to have been\r\neducated at a northern university, and to have become an Advocate.\r\nLater, he went to London; and taught languages. Two pamphlets on\r\nthe Bangorian controversy brought him into notice; and he wrote\r\nmany religious and political dissertations. \"A Defence of Primitive\r\nChristianity, against the Exhorbitant Claims of Fanatical and\r\nDissaffected Clergymen;\" \"Tracts on Religion, and on the Jacobite\r\nRebellion of '45;\" \"The Pillars of Priestcraft and Orthodoxy Shaken;\" \"A\r\nCordial for Low Spirits;\" are the titles of some of his compositions.\r\nIn politics, and in theology, he was a republican and free-thinker: he\r\ntranslated and edited \"The Spirit of Ecclesiastics in All Ages;\" he\r\nwas a contributor to \"The Independent Whig;\" and in a series of \"Cato's\r\nLetters,\" he discoursed at ease upon his usual topics. The Tacitus was\r\npublished in 1728, in two volumes folio: long dissertations are inserted\r\nin either volume; the literature in them excellent, the politics not so\r\ngood: the volumes, as well as the several parts of them, are dedicated\r\nto some Royal and many Noble Patrons. Gordon has also turned Sallust\r\ninto English: the book was published in 1744, in one handsome quarto;\r\n\"with Political Discourses upon that Author and Translations of\r\nCicero's Four Orations against Cataline.\" Walpole made Gordon the first\r\ncommissioner of wine licences. It is handed down, that Gordon was a\r\nburly person, \"large and corpulent.\" It is believed, that he found his\r\nway into \"The Dunciad,\" and that he is immortalised there among the\r\n\"Canaille Écrivante;\" the line\r\n\r\n  _Where Tindal dictates and Silenus snores_,\r\n\r\nis taken to be Pope's description of him. Gordon died in 1750; at the\r\nsame time as Dr. Middleton, the elegant biographer of Cicero: Lord\r\nBolingbroke is said to have observed, when the news was told him, \"Then\r\nis the best writer in England gone, and the worst.\" That Bolingbroke\r\nshould have disliked Gordon and his politics, does not surprise me; but\r\nI cannot understand for what reason he, and other good judges, despised\r\nhis writings. \"The chief glory of every people arises from its authors,\"\r\nDr. Johnson says; and happy the people, I would assert, who have no\r\nworse writers than Thomas Gordon. I wish to draw attention to Gordon's\r\ncorrect vocabulary, to his bold and pregnant language, and to his\r\nscholarly punctuation. Among our present writers, the art of punctuation\r\nis a lost accomplishment; and it is usual now to find writings with\r\nhardly anything but full stops; colons and semicolons are almost\r\nobsolete; commas are neglected, or misused; and our slovenly pages are\r\nstrewn with dashes, the last resources of an untidy thinker, the certain\r\nwitnesses to a careless and unfinished sentence. How different, and\r\nhow superior, is the way of Gordon; who, though he can be homely and\r\nfamiliar, never lays aside the well-bred and courteous manners of a\r\npolished Age. In his writings, the leading clauses of a sentence are\r\ndistinguished by their colons: the minor clauses, by their semicolons;\r\nthe nice meaning of the details is expressed, the pleasure and the\r\nconvenience of his readers are alike increased, by his right and elegant\r\nuse of commas. The comma, with us, is used as a loop or bracket, and\r\nfor little else: by the more accurate scholars of the last Age, it\r\nwas employed to indicate a finer meaning; to mark an emphasis, or an\r\nelision; to introduce a relative clause; to bring out the value of an\r\nhappy phrase, or the nice precision of an epithet. And thus the authors\r\nof the great century of prose, that orderly and spacious time, assembled\r\ntheir words, arranged their sentences, and marshalled them into careful\r\nperiods: without any loss to the subtile meaning of their thought,\r\nor any sacrifice of vigour, they exposed their subject in a dignified\r\nprocession of stately paragraphs; and when the end is reached we look\r\nback upon a perfect specimen of the writer's art. We have grown careless\r\nabout form, we have little sense for balance and proportion, and we\r\nhave sacrificed the good manners of literature to an ill-bred liking\r\nfor haste and noise: it has been decided, that the old way of writing\r\nis cumbersome and slow; as well might some guerilla chieftain have\r\nannounced to his fellow-barbarians, that Caesar's legions were not swift\r\nand beautiful in their manoeuvres, nor irresistible in their advance. I\r\nhave spoken of our long sentences, with nothing but full stops: they\r\nare variegated, here and there, with shorter sentences, sometimes of two\r\nwords; this way of writing is common in Macaulay or in the histories of\r\nMr. Green, and I have seen it recommended in Primers of Literature and\r\nManuals of Composition. With the jolting and unconnected fragments of\r\nthese authorities, I would contrast the musical and flowing periods of\r\nDr. Johnson's \"Lives of the Poets\": to study these works in solitude,\r\nwill probably be sufficient to justify my preference; but to hear them\r\nread aloud, should convert the most unwilling listener into an advocate\r\nof my opinion.\r\n\r\nDr. Birkbeck Hill, in the delightful Preface to his Boswell, explains\r\nhow he was turned by a happy chance to the study of the literature of\r\nthe eighteenth century; and how he read on and on in the enchanting\r\npages of \"The Spectator.\" \"From Addison in the course of time I passed\r\non,\" he continues, \"to the other great writers of his and the succeeding\r\nage, finding in their exquisitely clear style, their admirable\r\ncommon-sense, and their freedom from all the tricks of affectation, a\r\ndelightful contrast to so many of the eminent authors of our own time.\"\r\nThese words might be used of Gordon: I do not claim for him the style of\r\nAddison, nor the accomplished negligence of Goldsmith; these are graces\r\nbeyond the reach of art; but he exhibits the common-sense, and the clear\r\nstyle, of the eighteenth century. Like all the good writers of his time,\r\nhe is unaffected and \"simplex munditiis\"; he has the better qualities\r\nof Pyrrha, and is \"plain in his neatness.\" In Mr. Ward's edition of the\r\nEnglish Poets, there may be read side by side a notice of Collins and of\r\nGray; the one by Mr. Swinburne, the other by Mr. Matthew Arnold: I\r\nmake no allusion here to the greatness of either poet, to the merits of\r\neither style, nor to the value of either criticism. But the essay upon\r\nGray is quiet in tone; it has an unity of treatment, and never deserts\r\nthe principal subject; it is suffused with light, and full of the\r\nmost delicate allusions: the essay on Collins, by being written in\r\nsuperlatives and vague similes, deafens and perplexes the reader; and\r\nthe author, by squandering his resources, has no power to make fine\r\ndistinctions, nor to exalt one part of his thesis above another. These\r\ntwo performances illustrate the last quality in Gordon, and in the old\r\nwriters, to which I shall draw attention: they were always restrained\r\nin their utterances, and therefore they could be discriminating in\r\ntheir judgments; they could be emphatic without noise, and deep without\r\nobscurity, ornamental but not vulgar, carefully arranged but not stiff\r\nor artificial. They exhibit the three indispensable gifts of the\r\nfinest authorship: \"simplicitas munditiis,\" \"lucidus ordo,\" \"curiosa\r\nfelicitas.\"\r\n\r\nIn this volume, Gordon's punctuation has been generally followed: his\r\northography has been modernised a little, though not by my hands,\r\nnor with my consent; and I have observed without regret, that some of\r\nGordon's original spellings have eluded the vigilance of the printer:\r\nthat stern official would by no means listen to my entreaties for the\r\nlong \"SS,\" the turn-over words, or the bounteous capitals, which add so\r\nmuch to the seductive and sober dignity of an eighteenth-century page;\r\nbut, on the whole, we have given a tolerable reproduction of Gordon's\r\nfolio. In the second edition, he himself made more changes than\r\nimprovements. I will not say, that Gordon has always conveyed the exact\r\nmeaning of the sentences of Tacitus: but he has done what is better,\r\nand more difficult; he has grasped the broad meaning of his author, and\r\ncaught something of his lofty spirit. \"A translation,\" he says, \"ought\r\nto read like an original;\" and Gordon has not failed, I think, to reach\r\nthis perfection. It is not commonly attained among translators: Gordon\r\nsays, of one rendering of Tacitus, \"'Tis not the fire of Tacitus, but\r\nhis embers; quenched with English words, cold and Gothick.\" Of\r\nthe author of another version, he says \"Learning is his chief\r\naccomplishment, and thence his translation is a very poor one.\" This\r\njudgment is true of most modern translations from the Ancients; they\r\nmay be correct versions, but are miserable English: the authors, while\r\nstudying the most perfect models of the art of writing, have produced\r\ncopies which are not literature at all. From this low company, I would\r\nrescue Sir Charles Bowen's \"Virgil\": a delightful poem, to those who are\r\nignorant of Latin; an exquisite production, and an amazing triumph,\r\nto those who converse with the original. There are many English\r\ntranslations of Tacitus: the first, by Sir Henry Savile and \"one\r\nGreenway\"; the former, says Gordon, \"has performed like a schoolmaster,\r\nthe latter like a school-boy.\" Anthony à Wood writes in another strain,\r\nin the \"Athenae Oxonienis\": \"A rare Translation it is, and the Work of\r\na very Great Master indeed, both in our Tongue and that Story. For if\r\nwe consider the difficulty of the Original, and the Age wherein the\r\nTranslation lived, it is both for the exactness of the version, and\r\nthe chastity of the Language, one of the most accurate and perfect\r\ntranslations that ever were made into English.\" There is a rendering\r\nby Murphy, diffuse and poor; a dilution of Gordon, worthy neither of\r\nTacitus nor of the English tongue. There are translations, too, into\r\nalmost every modern language: I would give the highest praise to\r\nDavanzati; a scholar of Tuscany, who lived in the sixteenth century.\r\nIn French, I cannot but admire the labours of M. Burnouf: although the\r\naustere rules, the precise constructions, and the easy comportment of\r\nthe French prose are not suited to the style of Tacitus, and something\r\nof his weight and brevity are lost; yet the translator never loses the\r\ndepth and subtilty of his author's meaning; his work is agreeable to\r\nread, and very useful to consult. The maps and the genealogical tables\r\nin the three volumes of Messrs. Church and Brodribb's translation are\r\nalso of the greatest service, and the notes are sometimes most amusing.\r\n\r\nOf Tacitus himself, there is little for me to say: those, who know him,\r\ncan judge for themselves; to those who do not, no words are able to\r\nconvey an adequate impression. \"Who is able to infuse into me,\" Cardinal\r\nNewman asks, \"or how shall I imbibe, a sense of the peculiarities of\r\nthe style of Cicero or Virgil, if I have not read their writings? No\r\ndescription, however complete, could convey to my mind an exact likeness\r\nof a tune, or an harmony, which I have never heard; and still less of a\r\nscent, which I have never smelled: and if I said that Mozart's melodies\r\nwere as a summer sky, or as the breath of Zephyr, I shall be better\r\nunderstood by those who knew Mozart, than by those who did not.\" These\r\ntruths are little remembered by modern critics: though, indeed, it is\r\nnot possible to convey to a reader adequate notions about the style\r\nof an author, whom that reader has not pondered for himself; about\r\nhis thoughts or his subjects, it may be different. Still, I may write\r\nsomething about the manner of Tacitus, which will not violate Cardinal\r\nNewman's laws, nor be an outrage to taste and common-sense. \"It is the\r\ngreat excellence of a writer,\" says Dr. Johnson, \"to put into his book\r\nas much as it will hold:\" and if this judgment be sound, then is Tacitus\r\nthe greatest of all writers in prose. Gordon says of him, \"He explains\r\nevents with a redundancy of images, and a frugality of words: his\r\nimages are many, but close and thick; his words are few, but pointed and\r\nglowing; and even his silence is instructive and affecting. Whatever he\r\nsays, you see; and all, that you see, affects you. Let his words be ever\r\nso few, his thought and matter are always abundant. His imagination is\r\nboundless, yet never outruns his judgment; his wisdom is solid and vast,\r\nyet always enlivened by his imagination. He starts the idea, and lets\r\nthe imagination pursue it; the sample he gives you is so fine, that you\r\nare presently curious to see the whole piece, and then you have your\r\nshare in the merit of the discovery; a compliment, which some able\r\nwriters have forgot to pay to their readers.\" I would remark here, that\r\nmany of the old writers give me the sense of handling things, they are\r\ndefinite and solid; while some of the moderns appear to play with words\r\nonly, and never to come up with the objects of their pursuit: \"we are\r\ntoo often ravished with a sonorous sentence,\" as Dr. Johnson says, \"of\r\nwhich, when the noise is past, the meaning does not long remain.\" But\r\nof Tacitus, Gordon says, \"His words and phrases are admirably adapted\r\nto his matter and conceptions, and make impressions sudden and wonderful\r\nupon the mind of man. Stile is a part of genius, and Tacitus had one\r\npeculiar to himself; a sort of language of his own, one fit to express\r\nthe amazing vigour of his spirit, and that redundancy of reflections\r\nwhich for force and frequency are to be equalled by no writer before nor\r\nsince.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Johnson, however, says in another place, \"Tacitus, Sir, seems to me\r\nrather to have made notes for an historical work, than to have written\r\na history:\" I must own, that upon the subject of Tacitus, I prefer the\r\nsentiments of Gordon; and Montaigne would agree with me, for he says, \"I\r\ndo not know any author, who, in a work of history, has taken so broad\r\na view of human events, or given a more just analysis of particular\r\ncharacters.\" The impressions of Tacitus are indeed wonderful: I doubt,\r\nwhether volumes could bring us nearer to the mutinous legions, than the\r\nfew chapters in which he records their history. I am always delighted\r\nby Gordon's way of telling the battle, in which the iron men of Sacrovir\r\nwere overthrown; the account begins on page 139. Then how satisfying is\r\nthe narrative of the wars in Germany, of the shipwreck, of the funeral\r\nof Varus and the slaughtered legions; how pleasing the description of\r\nGermanicus' antiquarian travels in Egypt, and in Greece. Though Tacitus\r\nis not a maker of \"descriptions,\" in our modern sense: there is but one\r\n\"description\" in \"The Annals,\" so far as I remember, it is of Capri; and\r\nit is not the sort, that would be quoted by a reviewer, as a \"beautiful\r\ncameo of description.\" With Tacitus, a field of battle is not an\r\noccasion for \"word-painting,\" as we call it; the battle is always first,\r\nthe scenery of less importance. He tells, what it is necessary to know;\r\nbut he is too wise to think, that we can realise from words, a place\r\nwhich we have never seen; and too sound in his taste, to forget the\r\nwholesome boundaries between poetry and prose. This is the way of all\r\nthe ancient writers. In a work on \"Landscape,\" I remember that Mr.\r\nHamerton mourns over the Commentaries of Caesar; because they do not\r\nresemble the letters of a modern war-correspondent; Ascham, on the other\r\nhand, a man of real taste and learning, says of the Commentaries, \"All\r\nthings be most perfectly done by him; in Caesar only, could never yet\r\nfault be found.\" I agree with Ascham: I think I prefer the Commentaries\r\nas they are, chaste and quiet; I really prefer them to Mr. Kinglake's\r\n\"Crimean War,\" or to Mr. Forbes' Despatches, or even to the most\r\neffusive pages of Mr. Stanley's book on Africa.\r\n\r\nIn \"The Life of Agricola,\" I would mention the simplicity of the\r\ntreatment and the excellence of the taste. Tacitus does not recite the\r\nwhole of Roman history, nor assemble all the worthies out of Plutarch.\r\nAgricola is not compared to the pyramids, to the Flavian circus, nor to\r\nany works of art and literature: these flights of imagination were\r\nnot known to the Ancients; but in a learned modern, I have seen Dante\r\ncompared to Wagner's operas, to the Parthenon and St. Peter's, and to\r\nJustinian's code. The sanctities of private life are not violated; yet\r\nwe know everything, that it is decent to know, about Agricola. Lord\r\nColeridge has given a beautiful rendering of the closing passages of\r\n\"The Agricola,\" in his account of Mr. Matthew Arnold: these elegant\r\npapers are not only models of good English; but are conspicuous,\r\namong recent obituary notices, for their fine taste and their becoming\r\nreticence. From the excesses of modern biographers, Tacitus was in\r\nlittle danger; thanks to his Roman sense, and to the qualities of the\r\nRoman Language. \"Economy,\" says Mr. Symonds, \"is exhibited in every\r\nelement of this athletic tongue. Like a naked gladiator all bone and\r\nmuscle, it relies upon bare sinewy strength.\" That author speaks of \"the\r\naustere and masculine virtues of Latin, the sincerity and brevity of\r\nRoman speech;\" and Tacitus is, beyond any doubt, the strongest, the\r\nausterest, the most pregnant of all the Romans. \"Sanity,\" says Mr.\r\nMatthew Arnold, in conclusion, \"that is the great virtue of the ancient\r\nliterature; the want of that is the great defect of the modern, in\r\nspite of all its variety and power.\" \"It is impossible to read the great\r\nancients, without losing something of our caprice and eccentricity. I\r\nknow not how it is, but their commerce with the ancients appears to\r\nme to produce, in those who constantly practise it, a steadying and\r\ncomposing effect upon the judgment, not of literary works only, but of\r\nmen and events in general. They are like persons who have had a very\r\nweighty and impressive experience; they are more truly than others under\r\nthe empire of facts, and more independent of the language current among\r\nthose with whom they live.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been told of Cardinal Newman, that he never liked to pass\r\na single day, without rendering an English sentence into Latin. To\r\nconverse with the Roman authors, to handle their precise and sparing\r\nlanguage, is, I can well believe it, a most wholesome discipline;\r\nand the most efficient remedy against those faults of diffuseness, of\r\nobscurity, and of excess, which are only too common among the writers\r\nof our day. It may have been to this practice, that Cardinal Newman owed\r\nsomething of his clearness, and of his exquisite simplicity: and for\r\nhis style, he should be idolised by every one who has a taste for\r\nliterature. I have said many things in praise of the ancient authors: it\r\npleases me, as I finish, to offer my humble tribute to an author who is\r\nquite our own; to one, who in all his writings has bequeathed us perfect\r\nmodels of chaste, of lucid, and of melodious prose.\r\n\r\nNEW COLLEGE, OXFORD: _September_ 15, 1890.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST SIX BOOKS OF THE ANNALS OF TACITUS:\r\n\r\nBEING AN HISTORY OF THE EMPEROR TIBERIUS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ANNALS OF TACITUS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK I\r\n\r\nA.D. 14 AND 15.\r\n\r\n\r\nKings were the original Magistrates of Rome: Lucius Brutus founded\r\nLiberty and the Consulship: Dictators were chosen occasionally, and used\r\nonly in pressing exigencies. Little more than two years prevailed the\r\nsupreme power of the Decemvirate, and the consular jurisdiction of the\r\nmilitary Tribunes not very many. The domination of Cinna was but short,\r\nthat of Sylla not long. The authority of Pompey and Crassus was quickly\r\nswallowed up in Caesar; that of Lepidus and Anthony in Augustus. The\r\nCommonwealth, then long distressed and exhausted by the rage of her\r\ncivil dissensions, fell easily into his hands, and over her he assumed\r\na sovereign dominion; yet softened with a venerable name, that of Prince\r\nor Chief of the Senate. But the several revolutions in the ancient\r\nfree state of Rome, and all her happy or disastrous events, are already\r\nrecorded by writers of signal renown. Nor even in the reign of Augustus\r\nwere there wanting authors of distinction and genius to have composed\r\nhis story; till by the prevailing spirit of fear, flattery, and\r\nabasement they were checked. As to the succeeding Princes, Tiberius,\r\nCaligula, Claudius, and Nero; the dread of their tyranny, whilst they\r\nyet reigned, falsified their history; and after their fall, the fresh\r\ndetestation of their cruelties inflamed their Historians. Hence my own\r\ndesign of recounting briefly certain incidents in the reign of Augustus,\r\nchiefly towards his latter end, and of entering afterwards more fully\r\ninto that of Tiberius and the other three; unbiassed as I am in this\r\nundertaking by any resentment, or any affection; all the influences of\r\nthese personal passions being far from me.\r\n\r\nWhen, after the fall of Brutus and Cassius, there remained none to fight\r\nfor the Commonwealth, and her arms were no longer in her own hands; when\r\nSextus Pompeius was utterly defeated in Sicily, Lepidus bereft of\r\nhis command. Marc Anthony slain; and of all the chiefs of the late\r\nDictator's party, only Octavius his nephew was left; he put off the\r\ninvidious name of Triumvir, and styling himself Consul, pretended that\r\nthe jurisdiction attached to the Tribuneship was his highest aim, as in\r\nit the protection of the populace was his only view: but when once he\r\nhad laid his foundations wider, secured the soldiery by liberality and\r\ndonations, gained the people by store of provisions, and charmed all\r\nby the blessings and sweetness of public peace, he began by politic\r\ngradations to exalt himself, to extend his domination, and with his own\r\npower to consolidate the authority of the Senate, jurisdiction of the\r\nMagistrate, and weight and force of the Laws; usurpations in which he\r\nwas thwarted by no man: all the bravest Republicans and his most\r\ndaring foes were slain in battle, or gleaned up by the late sanguinary\r\nproscriptions; and for the surviving Nobility, they were covered with\r\nwealth, and distinguished with public honours, according to the measure\r\nof their debasement, and promptness to bondage. Add, that all the\r\ncreatures of this new Power, who in the loss of public freedom had\r\ngained private fortunes, preferred a servile condition, safe and\r\npossessed, to the revival of ancient liberty with personal peril.\r\nNeither were the Provinces averse to the present Revolution, and\r\nSovereignty of one; since under that of the people and Senate they had\r\nlived in constant fear and mistrust, sorely rent and harassed as they\r\nwere by the raging competition amongst our Grandees, as well as by the\r\ngrievous rapine and exactions of our Magistrates; in vain too, under\r\nthese their oppressions, had been their appeal to the protection of the\r\nlaws, which were utterly enfeebled and borne down by might and violence,\r\nby faction and parties; nay, even by subornation and money.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Augustus, in order to fortify his domination with collateral\r\nbulwarks, raised his sister's son Claudius Marcellus, a perfect youth,\r\nto the dignity of Pontiff and that of Aedile; preferred Marcus Agrippa\r\nto two successive Consulships, a man in truth meanly born but an\r\naccomplished soldier, and the companion of his victories; and Marcellus,\r\nthe husband of Julia, soon after dying, chose him for his son-in-law.\r\nEven the sons of his wife, Tiberius Nero, and Claudius Drusus, he\r\ndignified with high military titles and commands; though his house\r\nwas yet supported by descendants of his own blood. For into the Julian\r\nfamily and name of the Caesars he had already adopted Lucius and Caius,\r\nthe sons of Agrippa; and though they were but children, neither of them\r\nseventeen years old, vehement had been his ambition to see them declared\r\nPrinces of the Roman Youth and even designed to the Consulship; while\r\nopenly, he was protesting against admitting these early honours.\r\nPresently, upon the decease of Agrippa, were these his children snatched\r\naway, either by their own natural but hasty fate, or by the deadly fraud\r\nof their step-mother Livia; Lucius on his journey to command the armies\r\nin Spain; Caius in his return from Armenia, ill of a wound: and as\r\nDrusus, one of her own sons, had been long since dead, Tiberius remained\r\nsole candidate for the succession. Upon this object, centred all\r\nprincely honours; he was by Augustus adopted for his son, assumed\r\nColleague in the Empire, partner in the jurisdiction tribunitial, and\r\npresented under all these dignities to the several armies: instances\r\nof grandeur which were no longer derived from the secret schemes\r\nand plottings of his mother, as in times past, while her husband had\r\nunexceptionable heirs of his own, but thenceforth bestowed at her open\r\nsuit. For as Augustus was now very aged, she had over him obtained\r\nsuch absolute sway, that for her pleasure he banished into the Isle of\r\nPlanasia his only surviving grandson, Agrippa Postumus; one, in truth,\r\ndestitute of laudable accomplishments, in his temper untractable,\r\nand stupidly conceited of his mighty strength, but branded with no\r\nmisdemeanour or transgression. The Emperor had withal set Germanicus,\r\nthe son of Drusus, over eight legions quartered upon the Rhine, and\r\nobliged Tiberius to adopt him, though Tiberius had then a son of his\r\nown, one of competent years; but it was the study of Augustus, to secure\r\nhimself and the succession by variety of stays and engraftments. War at\r\nthat time there was none, except that in Germany, kept on foot rather\r\nto abolish the disgrace sustained by Quinctilius Varus, there slain with\r\nhis army, than from any ambition to enlarge the Empire, or for any other\r\nvaluable advantage. In profound tranquillity were affairs at Rome. To\r\nthe Magistrates remained their wonted names; of the Romans the younger\r\nsort had been born since the battle of Actium, and even most of the old\r\nduring the civil wars: how few were then living who had seen the ancient\r\nfree State!\r\n\r\nThe frame and economy of Rome being thus totally overturned, amongst\r\nthe Romans were no longer found any traces of their primitive spirit,\r\nor attachment to the virtuous institutions of antiquity. But as the\r\nequality of the whole was extinguished by the sovereignty of one, all\r\nmen regarded the orders of the Prince as the only rule of conduct and\r\nobedience; nor felt they any anxiety, while Augustus yet retained vigour\r\nof life, and upheld the credit of his administration with public peace,\r\nand the imperial fortune of his house. But when he became broken with\r\nthe pressure of age and infirmities; when his end was at hand, and\r\nthence a new source of hopes and views was presented, some few there\r\nwere who began to reason idly about the blessings and recovery of\r\nLiberty; many dreaded a civil war, others longed for one; while far the\r\ngreater part were uttering their several apprehensions of their future\r\nmasters; \"that naturally stern and savage was the temper of Agrippa,\r\nand by his public contumely enraged into fury; and neither in age nor\r\nexperience was he equal to the weight of Empire. Tiberius indeed had\r\narrived at fulness of years, and was a distinguished captain, but\r\npossessed the inveterate pride entailed upon the Claudian race; and many\r\nindications of a cruel nature escaped him, in spite of all his arts to\r\ndisguise it; besides that from his early infancy he was trained up in a\r\nreigning house, and even in his youth inured to an accumulation of power\r\nand honours, consulships and triumphs: nor during the several years of\r\nhis abode at Rhodes, where, under the plausible name of retirement, a\r\nreal banishment was covered, did he exercise other occupation than that\r\nof meditating future vengeance, studying the arts of treachery, and\r\npractising secret, abominable sensualities: add to these considerations,\r\nthat of his mother, a woman inspired with all the tyranny of her\r\nsex; yes, the Romans must be under bondage to a woman, and moreover\r\nenthralled by two youths, who would first combine to oppress the State,\r\nand then falling into dissension, rend it piecemeal.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the public was engaged in these and the like debates, the illness\r\nof Augustus waxed daily more grievous; and some strongly suspected the\r\npestilent practices of his wife. For there had been, some months before,\r\na rumour abroad, that Augustus having singled out a few of his most\r\nfaithful servants, and taken Fabius Maximus for his only companion, had,\r\nwith no other retinue, sailed secretly over to the Island of Planasia,\r\nthere to visit his Grandson Agrippa; that many tears were shed on both\r\nsides, many tokens of mutual tenderness shown, and hopes from thence\r\nconceived, that the unhappy youth would be restored to his own place in\r\nhis Grandfather's family. That Maximus had disclosed it to Martia, she\r\nto Livia; and thence the Emperor knew that the secret was betrayed: that\r\nMaximus being soon after dead (dead, as it was doubted, through fear, by\r\nhis own hands), Martia was observed, in her lamentations and groans\r\nat his funeral, to accuse herself as the sad cause of her husband's\r\ndestruction. Whatever truth was in all this, Tiberius was scarce entered\r\nIllyrium, but he was hastily recalled by his mother's letters: nor is\r\nit fully known whether at his return to Nola, he found Augustus yet\r\nbreathing, or already breathless. For Livia had carefully beset the\r\npalace, and all the avenues to it, with detachments of the guards; and\r\ngood news of his recovery were from time to time given out. When she had\r\ntaken all measures necessary in so great a conjuncture, in one and the\r\nsame moment was published the departure of Augustus, and the accession\r\nof Tiberius.\r\n\r\nThe first feat of this new reign was the murder of young Agrippa: the\r\nassassin, a bold and determined Centurion, found him destitute of arms,\r\nand little apprehending such a destiny, yet was scarce able to despatch\r\nhim. Of this transaction Tiberius avoided any mention in the Senate: he\r\nwould have it pass for done by the commands of Augustus; as if he had\r\ntransmitted written orders to the Tribune, who guarded Agrippa, \"to slay\r\nhim the instant he heard of his grandfather's decease.\" It is very true\r\nthat Augustus had made many and vehement complaints of the young man's\r\nobstinate and unruly demeanour, and even solicited from the Senate\r\na decree to authorise his banishment: but he never hardened himself\r\nagainst the sentiments of nature, nor in any instance dipped his hands\r\nin his own blood; neither is it credible that he would barbarously\r\nsacrifice the life of his grandson for the security and establishment of\r\nhis step-son. More probable it is, that this hasty murder was purely the\r\nwork of Tiberius and Livia; that the young Prince, hated and dreaded\r\nby both, fell thus untimely, to rid the one of his apprehensions and\r\na rival, and to satiate in the other the rancorous spirit of a\r\nstep-mother. When the Centurion, according to the custom of the army,\r\nacquainted Tiberius, \"that his commands were executed;\" he answered, \"he\r\nhad commanded no such execution, and the Centurion must appear before\r\nthe Senate, and for it be answerable to them.\" This alarmed Sallustius\r\nCrispus, who shared in all his secret counsels, and had sent the\r\nCenturion the warrant: he dreaded that he should be arraigned for the\r\nassassination, and knew it equally perilous either to confess the truth,\r\nand charge the Emperor; or falsely to clear the Emperor, and accuse\r\nhimself. Hence he had recourse to Livia, and warned her, \"never to\r\ndivulge the secrets of the palace, never to expose to public examination\r\nthe ministers who advised, nor the soldiers who executed: Tiberius\r\nshould beware of relaxing the authority of the Prince, by referring all\r\nthings to that of the Senate; since it was the indispensable prerogative\r\nof sovereignty for all men to be accountable only to one.\"\r\n\r\nNow at Rome, Consuls, Senators, and Roman Knights, were all rushing\r\nwith emulation into bondage, and the higher the quality of each the more\r\nfalse and forward the men; all careful so to frame their faces, as to\r\nreconcile false joy for the accession of Tiberius, with feigned sadness\r\nfor the loss of Augustus: hence they intermingled fears with gladness,\r\nwailings with gratulations, and all with servile flattery. Sextus\r\nPompeius and Sextus Apuleius, at that time Consuls, took first the oath\r\nof fidelity to Tiberius; then administered it to Seius Strabo and\r\nCaius Turranius; the former Captain of the Praetorian Guards, the other\r\nIntendant of the Public Stores. The oath was next given to the Senate,\r\nto the people, and to the soldiery: all by the same Consuls; for\r\nTiberius affected to derive all public transactions from the legal\r\nministry of the Consuls, as if the ancient Republic still subsisted, and\r\nhe were yet unresolved about embracing the sovereign rule: he even owned\r\nin his edict for summoning the Senate, that he issued it by virtue of\r\nthe Tribunitial power, granted him under Augustus. The edict, too,\r\nwas short and unexceptionably modest. It imported that, \"they were to\r\nconsider of the funeral honours proper to be paid his deceased Father:\r\nfor himself he would not depart from the corpse; and further than this\r\nedict implied, he claimed no share in the public administration.\" Yet\r\nfrom the moment Augustus was dead, he usurped all the prerogatives of\r\nimperial state, gave the word to the Praetorian Cohorts; had soldiers\r\nabout the palace, guards about his person, went guarded in the street,\r\nguarded to the Senate, and bore all the marks of Majesty: nay, he writ\r\nletters to the several armies in the undisguised style of one already\r\ntheir Prince: nor did he ever hesitate in expression, or speak with\r\nperplexity, but when he spoke to the Senate. The chief cause of his\r\nobscurity there proceeded from his fear of Germanicus: he dreaded that\r\nhe, who was master of so many legions, of numberless auxiliaries, and\r\nof all the allies of Rome; he, who was the darling of the people, might\r\nwish rather to possess the Empire, than to wait for it; he likewise, in\r\nthis mysterious way of dealing with the Senate, sought false glory, and\r\nwould rather seem by the Commonwealth chosen and called to the Empire,\r\nthan to have crept darkly into it by the intrigues of a woman, or by\r\nadoption from a superannuated Prince. It was also afterwards found, that\r\nby this abstruseness and counterfeit irresolution he meant to penetrate\r\ninto the designs and inclinations of the great men: for his jealous\r\nspirit construed all their words, all their looks, into crimes; and\r\nstored them up in his heart against a day of vengeance.\r\n\r\nWhen he first met the Senate, he would bear no other business to be\r\ntransacted but that about the funeral of Augustus. His last will\r\nwas brought in by the Vestal Virgins: in it Tiberius and Livia were\r\nappointed his heirs, Livia adopted into the Julian family, and dignified\r\nwith the name of Augusta: into the next and second degree of heirship he\r\nadopted his grandchildren and their children; and in the third degree\r\nhe named the great men of Rome, most of them hated by him, but out of\r\nvainglory he named them, and for future renown. His legacies were not\r\nbeyond the usual bounds; only he left to the Roman people four hundred\r\nthousand great sesterces, [Footnote: £362,500.] to the populace or\r\ncommon sort, thirty-five thousand; to every common soldier of the\r\nPraetorian Guards, a thousand small sesterces, [Footnote: £8, 6s. 8d.]\r\nand to every soldier of the Roman legions three hundred. [Footnote: £2,\r\n10s.] The funeral honours were next considered. The chief proposed were\r\nthese: Asinius Gallus moved that \"the funeral should pass through the\r\nTriumphal Gate:\" Lucius Arruntius, \"that the titles of all the laws\r\nwhich he had made, and the names of all the nations which he had\r\nconquered, should be carried before the corpse:\" Valerius Messala added,\r\nthat \"the oath of allegiance to Tiberius should be renewed every year;\"\r\nand being asked by Tiberius, \"whether at his instigation he had made\r\nthat motion?\" \"I spoke it as my opinion,\" says Messala; \"nor will I ever\r\nbe determined by any but my own, in things which concern the commonweal;\r\nlet who will be provoked by my freedom.\" Only this new turn was wanting\r\nto complete the prevailing flattery of the time. The Senators then\r\nconcurred in a loud cry, \"that upon their own shoulders they must bear\r\nthe body to the pile.\" But Tiberius declined the offer from an arrogant\r\nshow of moderation. Moreover, he cautioned the people by an edict, \"not\r\nto disturb the funeral functions with a zeal over-passionate, as they\r\nhad those of Julius Caesar; nor to insist that the corpse of Augustus\r\nshould be burnt rather in the Forum, than in the field of Mars, which\r\nwas the place appointed.\" On the funeral day the soldiers under arms\r\nkept guard; a mighty mockery this to those who had either seen, or heard\r\ntheir fathers describe, the day when Caesar the Dictator was slain:\r\nservitude was then new, its sorrows yet fresh and bitter; and liberty\r\nunsuccessfully retrieved by a deed which, while it seemed impious to\r\nsome, was thought altogether glorious by others, and hence tore Rome\r\ninto tumults and the violence of parties: they who knew that turbulent\r\nday, and compared it with the quiet exit of Augustus, ridiculed the\r\nfoppery of \"calling an aid of soldiers to secure a peaceable burial to a\r\nPrince who had grown old in peace and power, and even provided against a\r\nrelapse into liberty, by a long train of successors.\"\r\n\r\nHence much and various matter of observation concerning Augustus: the\r\nsuperstitious multitude admired the fortuitous events of his fortune;\r\n\"that the last day of his life, and the first of his reign, was the\r\nsame; that he died at Nola, in the same village, and in the same house,\r\nand in the same chamber, where his father Octavius died. They observed\r\nto his glory, his many Consulships, equal in number to those of Valerius\r\nCorvinus and of Caius Marius, joined together; that he had exercised the\r\npower of the Tribuneship seven-and-thirty continued years: that he was\r\none-and-twenty times proclaimed Imperator; with many other numerous\r\nhonours repeated to him, or created for him.\" Men of deeper discernment\r\nentered further into his life, but differed about it. His admirers said,\r\n\"that his filial piety to his father Caesar, and the distractions of the\r\nRepublic, where the laws no longer governed, had driven him into a civil\r\nwar; which, whatever be the first cause, can never be begun or carried,\r\non by just and gentle means.\" Indeed, to be revenged on the murderers of\r\nhis father, he had made many great sacrifices to the violent genius\r\nof Anthony; many to Lepidus: but when Lepidus was become sunk and\r\nsuperannuated in sloth; when Anthony was lost headlong in sensuality,\r\nthere was then no other remedy for the distracted State, rent piecemeal\r\nby its Chiefs, but the sovereignty of one: Augustus, however, never\r\nhad assumed to be over his country King, or Dictator; but settled the\r\ngovernment under the legal name of Prince, or Chief of the Senate: he\r\nhad extended the Empire, and set for its bounds the distant ocean\r\nand rivers far remote; the several parts and forces of the State, the\r\nlegions, the provinces, and the navy, were all properly balanced and\r\nconnected; the citizens lived dutifully under the protection of the\r\nlaw, the Allies in terms of respect, and Rome itself was adorned with\r\nmagnificent structures: indeed, in a few instances he had exerted the\r\narbitrary violence of power; and in but a few, only to secure the peace\r\nof the whole.\r\n\r\nIn answer to all this, it was urged, that \"his filial piety, and the\r\nunhappy situation of the Republic, were pure pretences; but the ardent\r\nlust of reigning, his true and only motive: with this spirit he had\r\nsolicited into his service, by bribery, a body of veteran soldiers: and\r\nthough a private youth, without post or magistracy, but, in defiance of\r\nlaw, levied an army: with this spirit he had debauched and bought\r\nthe Roman legions under the Consuls, while he was falsely feigning a\r\ncoalition with Pompey's republican party: that soon after, when he had\r\nprocured from the Senate, or rather usurped the honours and authority\r\nof the Praetorship; and when Hirtius and Pansa, the two Consuls, were\r\nslain, he seized both their armies: that it was doubted whether the\r\nConsuls fell by the enemy, or whether Pansa was not killed by pouring\r\npoison into his wounds; and Hirtius slain by his own soldiers; and\r\nwhether the young Caesar was not the black contriver of this bloody\r\ntreason: that by terror he had extorted the Consulship in spite of the\r\nSenate; and turned against the Commonwealth the very arms with which the\r\nCommonwealth had trusted him for her defence against Anthony. Add to all\r\nthis his cruel proscriptions, and the massacre of so many citizens, his\r\nseizing from the public and distributing to his own creatures so many\r\nlands and possessions; a violation of property not justified even by\r\nthose who gained by it. But, allowing him to dedicate to the Manes of\r\nthe Dictator the lives of Brutus and Cassius (though more to his honour\r\nhad it been to have postponed his own personal hate to public good), did\r\nhe not betray the young Pompey by an insidious peace, betray Lepidus by\r\na deceitful show of friendship? Did he not next ensnare Marc Anthony,\r\nfirst by treaties, those of Tarentum and Brundusium; then by a marriage,\r\nthat of his sister Octavia? And did not Anthony at last pay with his\r\nlife the penalty of that subdolous alliance? After this, no doubt there\r\nwas peace, but a bloody peace; bloody in the tragical defeat of Lollius,\r\nand that of Varus, in Germany; and at Rome, the Varrones, the Egnatii,\r\nthe Julii (those illustrious names) were put to death.\" Nor was his\r\ndomestic life spared upon this occasion. \"He had arbitrarily robbed\r\nNero of his wife big with child by her husband; and mocked the Gods\r\nby consulting the Priests; whether religion permitted him to marry her\r\nbefore her delivery, or obliged him to stay till after. His minions,\r\nTedius and Vedius Pollio, had lived in scandalous and excessive luxury:\r\nhis wife Livia, who wholly controlled him, had proved a cruel governess\r\nto the Commonwealth; and to the Julian house, a more cruel step-mother:\r\nhe had even invaded the incommunicable honours of the Gods, and setting\r\nup for himself temples like theirs, would like them be adored in\r\nthe image of a Deity, with all the sacred solemnity of Priests and\r\nsacrifices: nor had he adopted Tiberius for his successor, either out\r\nof affection for him, or from concern for the public welfare; but having\r\ndiscovered in him a spirit proud and cruel, he sought future glory from\r\nthe blackest opposition and comparison.\" For, Augustus, when, a few\r\nyears before, he solicited the Senate to grant to Tiberius another\r\nterm of the authority of the Tribuneship, though he mentioned him with\r\nhonour, yet taking notice of his odd humour, behaviour, and manners,\r\ndropped some expressions, which, while they seemed to excuse him,\r\nexposed and upbraided him.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the funeral of Augustus was over, a temple and divine\r\nworship were forthwith decreed him. The Senate then turned their instant\r\nsupplications to Tiberius, to fill his vacant place; but received\r\nan abstruse answer, touching the greatness of the Empire and his own\r\ndistrust of himself; he said that \"nothing but the divine genius of\r\nAugustus was equal to the mighty task: that for himself, who had been\r\ncalled by him into a participation of his cares, he had learnt\r\nby feeling them, what a daring, what a difficult toil was that of\r\ngovernment, and how perpetually subject to the caprices of fortune: that\r\nin a State supported by so many illustrious patriots they ought not to\r\ncast the whole administration upon one; and more easy to be administered\r\nwere the several offices of the Government by the united pains and\r\nsufficiency of many.\" A pompous and plausible speech, but in it little\r\nfaith and sincerity. Tiberius, even upon subjects which needed no\r\ndisguises, used words dark and cautious; perhaps from his diffident\r\nnature, perhaps from a habit of dissembling: at this juncture indeed,\r\nas he laboured wholly to hide his heart, his language was the more\r\ncarefully wrapped up in equivoques and obscurity: but the Senators, who\r\ndreaded nothing so much as to seem to understand him, burst into tears,\r\nplaints, and vows; with extended arms they supplicated the Gods, invoked\r\nthe image of Augustus, and embraced the knees of Tiberius. He then\r\ncommanded the imperial register to be produced and recited. It contained\r\na summary of the strength and income of the Empire, the number of\r\nRomans and auxiliaries in pay, the condition of the navy, of the\r\nseveral kingdoms paying tribute, and of the various provinces and\r\ntheir revenues, with the state of the public expense, the issues of the\r\nexchequer, and all the demands upon the public. This register was all\r\nwrit by the hand of Augustus; and in it he had subjoined his counsel to\r\nposterity, that the present boundaries of the Empire should stand fixed\r\nwithout further enlargement; but whether this counsel was dictated by\r\nfear for the public, or by envy towards his successors, is uncertain.\r\n\r\nNow when the Senate was stooping to the vilest importunity and\r\nprostrations, Tiberius happened to say, that, \"as he was unequal to\r\nthe weight of the whole government; so if they entrusted him with any\r\nparticular part, whatever it were, he would undertake it.\" Here Asinius\r\nGallus interposed: \"I beg to know, Caesar,\" says he, \"what part of\r\nthe government you desire for your share?\" He was astonished with\r\nthe unexpected question, and, for a short space, mute; but recovering\r\nhimself, answered, that \"it ill became his modesty to choose or reject\r\nany particular branch of the administration, when he desired rather to\r\nbe excused from the whole.\" Gallus, who in his face conjectured sullen\r\nsigns of displeasure, again accosted him, and said, \"by this question I\r\ndid not mean that you should do an impracticable thing, and share\r\nthat power which cannot be separated; but I meant to reason you into a\r\nconfession that the Commonwealth is but one body, and can be governed\r\nonly by one soul.\" He added an encomium upon Augustus, and reminded\r\nTiberius himself of his many victories, of the many civil employments\r\nwhich he had long and nobly sustained: nor even thus could he mollify\r\nthe wrath of Tiberius, who had long hated him, for that Gallus had\r\nmarried Vipsania, daughter of Marcus Agrippa, and formerly wife to\r\nTiberius, who thence suspected that by this match he meant to soar above\r\nthe rank of a subject, and possessed too the bold and haughty spirit of\r\nAsinius Pollio his father.\r\n\r\nLucius Arruntius incurred his displeasure next, by a speech not much\r\nunlike that of Gallus: it is true, that towards him Tiberius bore no\r\nold rancour; but Arruntius had mighty opulence, prompt parts, noble\r\naccomplishments, with equal popularity, and hence was marked by him with\r\na fell eye of suspicion. For, as Augustus, shortly before his decease,\r\nwas mentioning those among the great men, who were capable of the\r\nsupreme power, but would not accept it; or unequal to it, yet wished\r\nfor it; or such, as had both ambition and sufficiency; he had said, that\r\n\"Marcus Lepidus was qualified, but would reject it; Asinius would be\r\naspiring, but had inferior talents; and that Lucius Arruntius wanted no\r\nsufficiency, and upon a proper occasion would attempt it.\" That he spoke\r\nthus of Lepidus and Asinius, is agreed; but, instead of Arruntius, some\r\nwriters have transmitted the name of Cneius Piso: and every one of these\r\ngreat men, except Lepidus, were afterwards cut off, under the imputation\r\nof various crimes, all darkly framed by Tiberius. Quintus Haterius and\r\nMamercus Scaurus did thereafter incense his distrustful spirit;\r\nthe first by asking him, \"How long, Caesar, wilt thou suffer the\r\nCommonwealth to remain destitute of a head?\" Scaurus, because he had\r\nsaid \"there was room to hope that the prayers of the Senate would\r\nnot prove abortive, since he had not opposed as Tribune, nor rendered\r\ninvalid, as he might, the motion of the Consuls in his behalf.\" With\r\nHaterius he fell into instant rage; towards Scaurus his resentment was\r\nmore deep and implacable, and in profound silence he hid it. Wearied\r\nat last with public importunity and clamour, and with particular\r\nexpostulations, he began to unbend a little; not that he would own his\r\nundertaking the Empire, but only avoid the uneasiness of perpetually\r\nrejecting endless solicitations. It is known how Haterius, when he went\r\nnext day to the palace to implore pardon, and throwing himself at the\r\nfeet of Tiberius embraced his knees, narrowly escaped being slain by the\r\nsoldiers; because Tiberius, who was walking, tumbled down, whether by\r\nchance, or whether his legs were entangled in the arms of Haterius:\r\nneither was he a jot mollified by the danger which threatened so great a\r\nman, who was at length forced to supplicate Augusta for protection; nor\r\ncould even she obtain it, but after the most laboured entreaties.\r\n\r\nTowards Livia, too, exorbitant was the flattering court of the Senate.\r\nSome were for decreeing her the general title of Mother; others the more\r\nparticular one of Mother Of Her Country; and almost all moved, that to\r\nthe name of Tiberius should be added, The Son Of Julia: Tiberius urged\r\nin answer, that \"public honours to women ought to be warily adjudged,\r\nand with a sparing hand; and that with the same measure of moderation he\r\nwould receive such as were presented to himself.\" In truth, full of envy\r\nas he was, and anxious lest his own grandeur should sink as that of his\r\nmother rose, he would not suffer so much as a Lictor to be decreed her,\r\nand even forbade the raising her an altar upon her late adoption,\r\nor paying her any such solemnities. But for Germanicus he asked the\r\nProconsular power; and to carry him that dignity, honourable deputies\r\nwere sent, as also to mollify his sorrow for the death of Augustus. If\r\nfor Drusus he demanded not the same honour, it was because Drusus was\r\npresent and already Consul designed. He then named twelve candidates\r\nfor the Praetorship; the same number settled by Augustus; and though the\r\nSenate requested him to increase it, by an oath he bound himself never\r\nto exceed.\r\n\r\nThe privilege of creating Magistrates was now first translated from\r\nthe assemblies of the people to the Senate; for though the Emperor had\r\nbefore conducted all affairs of moment at his pleasure; yet till that\r\nday some were still transacted by the Tribes, and carried by their bent\r\nand suffrages. Neither did the regret of the people for the seizure of\r\nthese their ancient rights rise higher than some impotent grumbling. The\r\nSenate too liked the change; as by it they were released from the charge\r\nof buying votes, and from the shame of begging them: and so moderate was\r\nTiberius, that of the twelve candidates he only reserved to himself the\r\nrecommendation of four, to be accepted without opposition or caballing.\r\nAt the same time, the Tribunes of the people asked leave to celebrate at\r\ntheir own expense certain plays in honour of Augustus, such as were\r\nto be called after his name, and inserted in the calendar. But it was\r\ndecreed, that out of the Exchequer the charge should be defrayed, and\r\nthe Tribunes should in the circus wear the triumphal robe; but to be\r\ncarried in chariots was denied them. The annual celebration of these\r\nplays was, for the future, transferred to one of the Praetors, him\r\nin particular to whom should fall the jurisdiction of deciding suits\r\nbetween citizens and strangers.\r\n\r\nThus stood affairs at Rome when a sedition seized the legions in\r\nPannonia; without any fresh grounds, save that from a change of Princes,\r\nthey meant to assume a warrant for licentiousness and tumult, and from a\r\ncivil war hoped great earnings and acquisitions: they were three legions\r\nencamped together, all commanded by Junius Blesus, who, upon notice of\r\nthe death of Augustus and the accession of Tiberius, had granted the\r\nsoldiers a recess from their wonted duties for some days, as a time\r\neither of public mourning or festivity. From being idle they waxed\r\nwanton, quarrelsome, and turbulent; greedily listened to mutinous\r\ndiscourses; the most profligate amongst them had most credit with them,\r\nand at last they became passionate for a life of sloth and riot, utterly\r\naverse to all military discipline and every fatigue of the camp. In the\r\ncamp was one Percennius; formerly a busy leader in the embroilments\r\nof the theatre, and now a common soldier; a fellow of a petulant,\r\ndeclaiming tongue, and by inflaming parties in the playhouse, well\r\nqualified to excite and infatuate a crowd. This incendiary practised\r\nupon the ignorant and unwary, such as were solicitous what might prove\r\ntheir future usage, now Augustus was dead. He engaged them in nightly\r\nconfabulations, and by little and little incited them to violence and\r\ndisorders; and towards the evening, when the soberest and best affected\r\nwere withdrawn, he assembled the worst and most turbulent. When he\r\nhad thus ripened them for sedition, and other ready incendiaries were\r\ncombined with him, he personated the character of a lawful Commander,\r\nand thus questioned and harangued them:\r\n\r\n\"Why did they obey, like slaves, a few Centurions and a fewer Tribunes?\r\nWhen would they be bold enough to demand redress of their heavy\r\ngrievances, unless they snatched the present occasion, while the Emperor\r\nwas yet new and his authority wavering, to prevail with him by petition,\r\nor by arms to force him? They had already by the misery of many years\r\npaid dear for their patient sloth and stupid silence, since decrepit\r\nwith age and maimed with wounds, after a course of service for thirty or\r\nforty years, they were still doomed to carry arms: nor even to those who\r\nwere discharged was there any end of the misery of warfare; they were\r\nstill kept tied to the colours, and under the creditable title of\r\nVeterans endured the same hardships, and underwent the same labours.\r\nBut suppose any of them escaped so many dangers, and survived so many\r\ncalamities, where was their reward at last? Why, a long and weary march\r\nremained yet to be taken into countries far remote and strange; where,\r\nunder the name of lands given them to cultivate, they had unhospitable\r\nbogs to drain, and the wild wastes of mountains to manure. Severe and\r\nungainful of itself was the occupation of war: ten Asses [Footnote:\r\nAbout 5d.] a day the poor price of their persons and lives; out of this,\r\nthey must buy clothes, and tents, and arms; out of this, bribe the cruel\r\nCenturions for a forbearance of blows, and occasional exemption from\r\nhard duty: but stripes from their officers, and wounds from their\r\nenemies, hard winters and laborious summers, bloody wars and barren\r\npeace, were miseries without end: nor remained there other cure or\r\nrelief than to refuse to enlist but upon conditions certain, and fixed\r\nby themselves; particularly, that their pay be a denarius or sixteen\r\nAsses a day, [Footnote: About 8-1/2d.] sixteen years be the utmost\r\nterm of serving; when discharged, to be no longer obliged to follow the\r\ncolours, but have their reward in ready money, paid them in the camp\r\nwhere they earned it. Did the Praetorian Guards, they who had double\r\npay, they who after sixteen years' service were paid off and sent home,\r\nbear severer difficulties, undergo superior dangers? He did not mean to\r\ndetract from the merit of their brethren the City guards; their own lot\r\nhowever it was, to be placed amongst horrid and barbarous nations, nor\r\ncould they look from their tents, but they saw the foe.\"\r\n\r\nThe whole crowd received this harangue with shouts of applause; but\r\nfrom various instigations. Some displayed upon their bodies the obvious\r\nimpressions of stripes, others their hoary heads, many their vestments\r\nragged and curtailed, with backs utterly bare; as did all, their various\r\ngriefs, in the bitterness of reproach. At length to such excessive fury\r\nthey grew, that they proposed to incorporate the three legions into\r\none; nor by aught but emulation was the project defeated: for to his own\r\nlegion every man claimed the prerogative of swallowing and denominating\r\nthe other two. They took another method, and placed the three Eagles\r\nof the legions, with the standards of the several cohorts, altogether\r\nwithout rank or priority; then forthwith digged turf and were rearing\r\na tribunal, one high enough to be seen at a distance. In this\r\nhurry arrived Blesus, who, falling into sore rebukes, and by force\r\ninterrupting particulars, called with vehemence to all: \"Dip your hands\r\nrather in my blood: to murder your General will be a crime less shameful\r\nand heinous than to revolt from your Prince; for determined I am, either\r\nto preserve the legions in their faith and obedience, if you kill me not\r\nfor my intended good office; or my death, if I fall by your hands, shall\r\nhasten your remorse.\"\r\n\r\nFor all this, turfs were accumulated, and the work was already breast\r\nhigh, when, at last, overcome by his spirit and perseverance, they\r\nforbore. Blesus was an able speaker: he told them \"that sedition and\r\nmutiny were not the methods of conveying to the Emperor the pretensions\r\nof the soldiers; their demands too were new and singular; such as\r\nneither the soldiers of old had ever made to the ancient Generals, nor\r\nthey themselves to the deified Augustus: besides, their claims were\r\nill-timed, when the Prince, just upon his accession, was already\r\nembarrassed with the weight and variety of other cares. If, however,\r\nthey meant to try to gain in full peace those concessions, which, even\r\nafter a civil war, the conquerors never claimed; yet why trample upon\r\nduty and obedience, why reject the laws of the army, and rules of\r\ndiscipline? And if they meant to petition, why meditate violence? They\r\nmight at least appoint deputies; and in his presence trust them with\r\ntheir pretensions.\" Here they all cried out, \"that the son of Blesus,\r\none of their Tribunes, should execute that deputation; and demand in\r\ntheir name that, after sixteen years' service they should be discharged:\r\nthey said they would give him new orders, when he had succeeded in\r\nthese.\" After the departure of the young officer, a moderate recess\r\nensued; the soldiers however exulted to have carried such a point:\r\nthe sending the son of their General, as the public advocate for their\r\ncause, was to them full proof that they had gained by force and terror\r\nthat which by modesty and gentle means they would never have gained.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime those companies which, before the sedition began, were\r\nsent to Nauportum [Footnote: Over-Laybach, in Carniola.] to mend roads\r\nand bridges, and upon other duties, no sooner heard of the uproar in\r\nthe camp, but they cast off all obedience, tore away the ensigns, and\r\nplundered the neighbouring villages; even Nauportum itself, which for\r\ngreatness resembled a municipal town, was plundered. The endeavours\r\nof the Centurions to restrain this violence, were first returned with\r\nmockery and contempt, then with invectives and contumelies, at last\r\nwith outrage and blows. Their vengeance was chiefly bent against the\r\nCamp-Marshal, Aufidienus Rufus: him they dragged from his chariot, and,\r\nloading him with baggage, drove him before the first ranks; they then\r\ninsulted him, and asked in scorn, \"whether he would gladly bear such\r\nenormous burdens, whether endure such immense marches?\" Rufus had\r\nbeen long a common soldier, then became a Centurion, and afterwards\r\nCamp-Marshal; a severe restorer of primitive strictness and discipline;\r\nan indefatigable observer of every military duty, which he exacted from\r\nothers with the more rigour, as he had himself undergone them all with\r\npatience.\r\n\r\nBy the arrival of this tumultuous band the sedition was again awakened\r\nto its former outrage, and the seditious, roving abroad without control,\r\nravaged the country on every side. Blesus, for an example of terror\r\nto the rest, commanded those who were most laden with plunder, to be\r\npunished with stripes and cast into prison: for the General was still\r\ndutifully obeyed by the Centurions, and by all the soldiers of any\r\nmerit; but the criminals refused to submit, and even struggled with\r\nthe guard who were carrying them off; they clasped the knees of the\r\nbystanders, implored help from their fellows, now calling upon every\r\nindividual, and conjuring them by their particular names; then appealed\r\nto them in a body, and supplicated the company, the cohort, the legion\r\nto which they belonged; warning and proclaiming that the same ignominy\r\nand chastisement hung over them all. With the same breath they heaped\r\ninvectives without measure upon their General, and called upon heaven\r\nand all the Gods to be their witnesses and avengers; nor left they aught\r\nunattempted to raise effectual hatred, compassion, terror, and every\r\nspecies of fury. Hence the whole body rushed to their relief, burst open\r\nthe prison, unbound and rescued the prisoners: thus they owned for their\r\nbrethren, and incorporated with themselves, infamous revolters, and\r\ntraitors convict and condemned.\r\n\r\nHence the violence became more raging, and hence more sedition from more\r\nleaders. There was particularly one Vibulenus, a common soldier, who,\r\nexalted on the shoulders of his comrades, before the tribunal of Blesus,\r\nthus declaimed in the ears of a multitude already outrageous, and eager\r\nto hear what he had to say. \"To these innocents,\" says he, \"to these\r\nmiserable sufferers, our fellow-soldiers, you have indeed restored\r\nbreath and liberty: but who will restore life to my poor brother; who\r\nmy poor brother to me? He was sent hither by the German armies, with\r\npropositions for our common good; and for this, was last night butchered\r\nby that same Blesus, who in the murder employed his gladiators, bloody\r\nmen, whom he purposely entertains and arms for our common execution.\r\nWhere, oh where, Blesus, hast thou thrown his unoffending and mangled\r\ncorpse? Even open enemies do not inhumanly deny burial to the slain:\r\nwhen I have satiated my sorrow with a thousand kisses, and a flood\r\nof tears; command me also to be murdered, that these our brethren may\r\ntogether bury my poor brother and me, slaughtered both as victims, yet\r\nboth guiltless of any crime but that of studying the common interest of\r\nthe legions.\"\r\n\r\nHe inflamed those his complaints and expostulations with affecting sighs\r\nand lamentations, beat his breast, tore his face, and showed all the\r\nsymptoms of anguish. Then those who carried him giving way, he threw\r\nhimself headlong at the feet of his companions; and thus prostrate and\r\nsupplicating, in them raised such a spirit of commiseration and such a\r\nstorm of vengeance, that one party of them instantly seized and bound\r\nthe General's gladiators; another, the rest of his family; while many\r\nran and dispersed themselves to search for the corpse: and had it not\r\nbeen quickly manifest that there was no corpse to be found, that\r\nthe slaves of Blesus had upon the rack cleared themselves, and that\r\nVibulenus never had any brother; they had gone nigh to have sacrificed\r\nthe General. As it was, they expulsed the Camp-Marshal and Tribunes;\r\nand as they fled, plundered their baggage: they likewise put to\r\ndeath Lucilius the Centurion, whom they had sarcastically named _Cedo\r\nAlteram_, because when upon the back of a soldier he had broken one\r\nwand, he was wont to call for another, and then a third. The other\r\nCenturions lurked in concealment, all but Julius Clemens, who for his\r\nprompt capacity was saved, in order to manage the negotiations of the\r\nsoldiers: even two of the legions, the eighth and the fifteenth, were\r\nready to turn their swords upon each other; and had, but for the ninth:\r\none Sirpicus, a centurion, was the subject of the quarrel; him the\r\neighth required to be put to death, and the fifteenth protected him; but\r\nthe ninth interposed with entreaties to both, and with threats to those\r\nwho would not listen to prayers.\r\n\r\nTiberius, however, close and impenetrable, and ever labouring to smother\r\nall melancholy tidings, was yet driven by those from Pannonia, to\r\ndespatch his son Drusus thither, accompanied by the principal nobility\r\nand guarded by two Praetorian cohorts; but charged with no precise\r\ninstructions, only to adapt his measures to the present exigency: the\r\ncohorts were strengthened with an extraordinary addition of chosen men,\r\nwith the greatest part of the Praetorian horse, and main body of the\r\nGerman, then the Emperor's guards. Aelius Sejanus, lately joined with\r\nhis father Strabo in the command of the Praetorian bands, was also sent,\r\nnot only as Governor to the young Prince, but as his credit with the\r\nEmperor was known to be mighty, to deal with the revolters by promises\r\nand terrors. When Drusus approached, the legions, for show of respect,\r\nmarched out to meet him; not with the usual symptoms and shouts of\r\njoy, nor with gay ensigns and arms glittering, but in a dress and\r\naccoutrements hideous and squalid: in their countenances too, though\r\ncomposed to sadness, were seen greater marks of sullenness and\r\ncontumacy.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he was within the camp, they secured the entrances with\r\nguards, and in several quarters of it placed parties upon duty: the rest\r\ncrowded about the tribunal of Drusus, who stood beckoning with his hand\r\nfor silence. Here as often as they surveyed their own numbers and met\r\none another's resentful looks, they uttered their rage in horrible\r\ncries: again, when upon the tribunal they beheld Caesar, awe and\r\ntrembling seized them: now, there prevailed an hollow and inarticulate\r\nmurmur; next, a furious clamour; then suddenly a dead silence: so that,\r\nby a hasty succession of opposite passions, they were at once dismayed\r\nand dreadful. When at last the uproar was stayed, he read his father's\r\nletters, who in them declared, \"that he would take an affectionate\r\ncare of the brave and invincible legions by whom he had sustained\r\nsuccessfully so many wars; and, as soon as his grief was a little\r\nabated, deal with the Senate about their demands; in the meantime he\r\nhad sent them his son, on purpose to make them forthwith all the\r\nconcessions, which could instantly be made them: the rest were to\r\nbe reserved for the Senate, the proper distributers of rewards and\r\npunishments by a right altogether unalienable.\"\r\n\r\nThe assembly answered, that to Julius Clemens they had intrusted what\r\nto speak in their name: he began with their demands, \"to be discharged\r\nafter sixteen years' service, to have the reward which, for past\r\nservices upon that discharge, they claimed; their pay to be increased\r\nto a Roman denarius; the veterans to be no longer detained under their\r\nensigns.\" When Drusus urged, that wholly in the judgment of the Senate\r\nand his father, these matters rested he was interrupted by their\r\nclamours: \"To what purpose came he; since he could neither augment their\r\npay, nor alleviate their grievances? and while upon them every officer\r\nwas allowed to inflict blows and death, the son of their Emperor wanted\r\npower to relieve them by one beneficent action. The policy this of the\r\nlate reign, when Tiberius frustrated every request of the soldiers, by\r\nreferring all to Augustus; now Drusus was come with the same artifices\r\nto delude them: were they never to have a higher visit than from the\r\nchildren of their Prince? It was, indeed, unaccountable, that to the\r\nSenate the Emperor should leave no part in the direction of the army,\r\nonly the rewarding of the soldiery: ought not the same Senate to be\r\nconsulted as often as a battle was to be fought, or a private man to be\r\npunished? or, were their recompenses to be adjudged by many masters,\r\nbut their punishments to remain without any restraint or moderator\r\nwhatsoever?\"\r\n\r\nAt last they abandoned the tribunal, and with menaces and insults fell\r\nupon all they met belonging to Drusus, either as guards or friends;\r\nmeditating thus to provoke a quarrel, and an introduction to blood.\r\nChiefly enraged they were against Cneius Lentulus, as one for years and\r\nwarlike renown superior to any about the person of Drusus, and thence\r\nsuspected to have hardened the Prince, and been himself the foremost to\r\ndespise these outrages in the soldiery: nor was it long after, that as\r\nhe was leaving Drusus, and from the foresight of danger returning to the\r\nwinter quarters, they surrounded him and demanded \"whither he went? to\r\nthe Emperor or Senate? there also to exercise his enmity to the legions,\r\nand oppose their interest?\" and instantly assaulted him with stones.\r\nHe was already covered with wounds and blood, and awaiting certain\r\nassassination, when the troops attending Drusus flew to his assistance\r\nand saved him.\r\n\r\nThe following night had a formidable aspect, and threatened the speedy\r\neruption of some tragical vengeance; when a phenomenon intervened and\r\nassuaged all. The Moon, in the midst of a clear sky, seemed to the\r\nsoldiers suddenly to sicken; and they, who were ignorant of the natural\r\ncause, took this for an omen foreboding the issue of their present\r\nadventures: to their own labours, they compared the eclipse of the\r\nplanet; and prophesied, \"that if to the distressed Goddess should be\r\nrestored her wonted brightness and vigour, equally successful would\r\nbe the issue of these their struggles.\" Hence they strove to charm and\r\nrevive her with sounds, and by ringing upon brazen metal, and an uproar\r\nof trumpets and cornets, made a vehement bellowing. As she appeared\r\nbrighter or darker, they exulted or lamented; but when gathering clouds\r\nhad utterly bereft them of her sight, and they believed her now buried\r\nin everlasting darkness; then, as minds once thoroughly dismayed are\r\npliant to superstition, they bewailed \"their own eternal sufferings\r\nthus portended, and that against their misdeeds the angry Deities\r\nwere contending.\" Drusus, who thought it behoved him to improve this\r\ndisposition of theirs, and to reap the fruits of wisdom from the\r\noperations of chance; ordered certain persons to go round, and apply\r\nto them from tent to tent. For this purpose, he called and employed\r\nthe Centurion Julius Clemens, and whoever else were by honest methods\r\nacceptable to the multitude. These insinuated themselves everywhere,\r\nwith those who kept watch, or were upon patrol, or guarded the gates;\r\nsoothing all with hopes, and by terrors rousing them. \"How long,\" said\r\nthey, \"shall we hold the son of our Emperor thus besieged? Where will\r\nour broils and wild contentions end? Shall we swear allegiance to\r\nPercennius and Vibulenus? Will Vibulenus and Percennius support us with\r\npay during our service, and reward us with lands when dismissed? In\r\nshort, shall two common men dispossess the Neros and the Drusi, and to\r\nthemselves assume the Empire of the Roman People? Let us be wiser; and\r\nas we were the last to revolt, be the first to relent. Such demands, as\r\ncomprise terms for all, are ever slowly accorded; but particulars may,\r\nwhen they please, merit instant favour, and instantly receive it.\"\r\nThese reasonings alarmed them, and filled them with mutual jealousies.\r\nPresently the fresh soldiers forsook the veterans, and one legion\r\nseparated from another; then by degrees returned the love of duty and\r\nobedience. They relinquished the guard of the gates: and the Eagles\r\nand other ensigns, which in the beginning of the tumult they had thrown\r\ntogether, were now restored each to its distinct station.\r\n\r\nDrusus, as soon as it was day, summoned an assembly, and though\r\nunskilled in speaking, yet with a haughtiness inherent in his blood,\r\nrebuked their past and commended their present behaviour. \"With threats\r\nand terrors,\" he said, \"it was impossible to subdue him; but if he saw\r\nthem reclaimed to submission, if from them he heard the language of\r\nsupplicants, he would send to his father to accept with a reconciled\r\nspirit the petitions of the legions,\" Hence, at their entreaty, for\r\ntheir deputy to Tiberius the same Blesus was again despatched, and with\r\nhim Lucius Apronius, a Roman Knight of the cohort of Drusus; and Justus\r\nCatonius, a Centurion of the first order. There followed great debates\r\nin the council of Drusus, while some advised \"to suspend all proceeding\r\ntill the return of the deputies, and by a course of courtesy the while\r\nto soothe the soldiers; others maintained, that remedies more potent\r\nmust needs be applied: in a multitude, was to be found nothing on this\r\nside extremes; always imperious where they are not awed, and to be\r\nwithout danger despised when frightened: to their present terror from\r\nsuperstition was to be added the dread of their General, by his dooming\r\nto death the authors of the sedition.\" Rather prompt to rigorous\r\ncounsels was the genius of Drusus: Vibulenus and Percennius were\r\nproduced, and by his command executed; it is by many recounted, that in\r\nhis own tent they were secretly despatched and buried; by others, that\r\ntheir bodies were ignominiously thrown over the entrenchments, for a\r\npublic spectacle of terror.\r\n\r\nSearch was then made for other remarkable incendiaries. Some were caught\r\nskulking without the camp, and there by the Centurions or Praetorian\r\nsoldiers slain; others were by their several companies delivered up, as\r\na proof of their own sincere faith. The consternation of the soldiers\r\nwas heightened by the precipitate accession of winter, with rains\r\nincessant and so violent, that they were unable to stir from their\r\ntents, or maintain common intercourse, nay, scarce to preserve their\r\nstandards, assaulted continually by tempestuous winds and raging floods.\r\nDread besides of the angry Gods still possessed them; nor was it at\r\nrandom, they thought, that such profane traitors were thus visited\r\nwith black eclipses and roaring tempests; neither against these their\r\ncalamities was there other relief than the relinquishing of a camp by\r\nimpiety contaminated and accursed, and after expiation of their guilt\r\nreturning to their several garrisons. The eighth legion departed first;\r\nand then the fifteenth: the ninth, with earnest clamours, pressed\r\nfor continuing there till the letters from Tiberius arrived; but when\r\ndeserted by the other two, their courage failed, and by following of\r\ntheir own accord, they prevented the shame of being forced. Drusus\r\nseeing order and tranquillity restored, without staying for the return\r\nof the deputies, returned himself to Rome.\r\n\r\nAlmost at the same time, and from the same causes, the legions in\r\nGermany raised an insurrection, with greater numbers, and thence with\r\nmore fury. Passionate too were their hopes that Germanicus would never\r\nbrook the rule of another, but yield to the spirit of the legions, who\r\nhad force sufficient to bring the whole Empire under his sway. Upon\r\nthe Rhine were two armies; that called the higher, commanded by Caius\r\nSilius, Lieutenant-General; the lower, by Aulus Caecina: the command in\r\nchief rested in Germanicus, then busy collecting the tribute in Gaul.\r\nThe forces however under Silius, with cautious ambiguity, watched the\r\nsuccess of the revolt which others began: for the soldiers of the lower\r\narmy had broken out into open outrages, which took its rise from the\r\nfifth legion, and the one-and-twentieth; who after them drew the first,\r\nand twentieth. These were altogether upon the frontiers of the Ubians,\r\npassing the campaign in utter idleness or light duty: so that upon the\r\nnews that Augustus was dead, the whole swarm of new soldiers lately\r\nlevied in the city, men accustomed to the effeminacies of Rome, and\r\nimpatient of every military hardship, began to possess the ignorant\r\nminds of the rest with many turbulent expectations, \"that now was\r\npresented the lucky juncture for veterans to demand entire dismission;\r\nthe fresh soldiers, larger pay; and all, some mitigation of their\r\nmiseries; as also to return due vengeance for the cruelties of the\r\nCenturions.\" These were not the harangues of a single incendiary, like\r\nPercennius amongst the Pannonian legions; nor uttered, as there, in the\r\nears of men who, while they saw before their eyes armies greater than\r\ntheir own, mutinied with awe and trembling: but here was a sedition of\r\nmany mouths, filled with many boasts, \"that in their hands lay the power\r\nand fate of Rome; by their victories the empire was enlarged, and from\r\nthem the Caesars took, as a compliment, the surname of Germanicus.\"\r\n\r\nNeither did Caecina strive to restrain them. A madness so extensive had\r\nbereft him of all his bravery and firmness. In this precipitate frenzy\r\nthey rushed at once, with swords drawn, upon the Centurions, the eternal\r\nobjects of their resentment, and always the first victims to their\r\nvengeance. Them they dragged to the earth, and upon each bestowed\r\na terrible portion of sixty blows; a number proportioned to that of\r\nCenturions in a legion. Then bruised, mangled, and half expiring, as\r\nthey were, they cast them all out of the camp, some into the stream\r\nof the Rhine. Septimius, who had for refuge fled to the tribunal of\r\nCaecina, and lay clasping his feet, was demanded with such imperious\r\nvehemence, that he was forced to be surrendered to destruction. Cassius\r\nCherea (afterwards famous to posterity for killing Caligula), then a\r\nyoung man of undaunted spirit, and one of the Centurions, boldly opened\r\nhimself a passage with his sword through a crowd of armed foes striving\r\nto seize him. After this no further authority remained to the Tribunes,\r\nnone to the Camp-Marshals. The seditious soldiers were their own\r\nofficers; set the watch, appointed the guard, and gave all orders proper\r\nin the present exigency; hence those who dived deepest into the spirit\r\nof the soldiery, gathered a special indication how powerful and obdurate\r\nthe present insurrection was like to prove; for in their conduct were no\r\nmarks of a rabble, where every man's will guides him, or the instigation\r\nof a few controls the whole. Here, all at once they raged, and all at\r\nonce kept silence; with so much concert and steadiness, that you would\r\nhave believed them under the sovereign direction of one.\r\n\r\nTo Germanicus the while, then receiving, as I have said, the tribute in\r\nGaul, news were brought of the decease of Augustus; whose grand-daughter\r\nAgrippina he had to wife, and by her many children: he was himself the\r\ngrandson of Livia, by her son Drusus, the brother of Tiberius; but ever\r\nunder heavy anxiety from the secret hate which his uncle and grandmother\r\nbore him: hate the more virulent as its grounds were altogether\r\nunrighteous; for, dear and adored was the memory of his father Drusus\r\namongst the Roman People, and from him was firmly expected that had he\r\nsucceeded to the Empire, he would have restored public liberty: hence\r\ntheir zeal for Germanicus, and of him the same hopes conceived; as\r\nfrom his youth he possessed a popular spirit, and marvellous affability\r\nutterly remote from the comportment and address of Tiberius, ever\r\nhaughty and mysterious. The animosities too between the ladies\r\nadministered fresh fuel; while towards Agrippina, Livia was actuated\r\nby the despite natural to step-mothers: and over-tempestuous was the\r\nindignation of Agrippina; only that her known chastity and love for her\r\nhusband, always gave her mind, however vehement, a virtuous turn.\r\n\r\nBut Germanicus, the nearer he stood to supreme rule, the more vigour he\r\nexerted to secure it to Tiberius: to him he obliged the Sequanians, a\r\nneighbouring people, as also the several Belgic cities, to swear present\r\nallegiance; and the moment he learnt the uproar of the legions, posted\r\nthither: he found them advanced without the camp to receive him, with\r\neyes cast down, in feigned token of remorse. After he entered the\r\nentrenchments, instantly his ears were filled with plaints and\r\ngrievances, uttered in hideous and mixed clamours: nay, some catching\r\nhis hand, as if they meant to kiss it, thrust his fingers into their\r\nmouths, to feel their gums destitute of teeth; others showed their limbs\r\nenfeebled, and bodies stooping under old age. As he saw the assembly\r\nmixed at random, he commanded them \"to range themselves into companies,\r\nthence more distinctly to hear his answers; as also to place before\r\nthem their several ensigns, that the cohorts at least might be\r\ndistinguished.\"\r\n\r\nWith slowness and reluctance it was, that they obeyed him; then\r\nbeginning with an encomium upon the \"venerable memory of Augustus,\" he\r\nproceeded to the \"many victories and many triumphs of Tiberius,\" and\r\nwith peculiar praises celebrated the \"glorious and immortal deeds, which\r\nwith these very legions in Germany he had accomplished;\" he next boasted\r\nthe quiet state of things, the consent of all Italy, the loyal faith\r\nof both the Gauls: and every quarter of the Roman State exempt from\r\ndisaffection and turbulence.\r\n\r\nThus far they listened with silence, at least with moderate murmuring;\r\nbut the moment he touched their sedition and questioned, \"where now was\r\nthe wonted modesty of soldiers? where the glory of ancient discipline?\r\nwhither had they chased their Tribunes, whither their Centurions?\" to a\r\nman, they stripped themselves to the skin, and there exposed the seams\r\nof their wounds and bruises of their chastisements, in the rage of\r\nreproach. Then in the undistinguished voice of uproar, they urged\r\n\"the exactions for occasional exemptions, their scanty pay, and their\r\nrigorous labours;\" which they represented in a long detail: \"ramparts to\r\nbe reared, entrenchments digged, trees felled and drawn, forage cut and\r\ncarried, fuel prepared and fetched,\" with every other article of\r\ntoil required by the exigencies of war, or to prevent idleness in the\r\nsoldiery. Above all, from the veterans arose a cry most horrible:\r\nthey enumerated thirty years or upwards undergone in the service; \"and\r\nbesought that to men utterly spent he would administer respite, nor\r\nsuffer them to be beholden to death for the last relief from their\r\ntoils; but discharge them from a warfare so lasting and severe, and\r\ngrant them the means of a comfortable recess.\" Nay, some there were\r\nwho of him required the money bequeathed them by Augustus; and towards\r\nGermanicus uttering zealous vows, with omens of happy fortune, declared\r\ntheir cordial attachment to his cause if he would himself assume the\r\nEmpire. Here, as if already stained with their treason, he leaped\r\nheadlong from the Tribunal; but with swords drawn they opposed his\r\ndeparture, and threatened his life, if he refused to return: yet, with\r\npassionate protestations that \"he would rather die than be a traitor,\"\r\nhe snatched his sword from his side, and aiming full at his breast,\r\nwould have buried it there, had not those who were next him seized his\r\nhand and by force restrained him. A cluster of soldiers in the extremity\r\nof the assembly exhorted him, nay, what is incredible to hear, some\r\nparticulars advancing nearer, exhorted him _to strike home_: in truth\r\none Calusidius, a common soldier, presented him his naked sword, and\r\nadded, \"it is sharper than your own;\" a behaviour which to the rest,\r\noutrageous as they were, seemed savage, and of horrid example: hence the\r\nfriends of Germanicus had time to snatch him away to his tent.\r\n\r\nIt was here consulted what remedy to apply: for it was advised, that\r\n\"ministers of sedition were preparing to be despatched to the other\r\narmy, to draw them too into a confederacy in the revolt; that the\r\ncapital of the Ubians was destined to be sacked; and if their hands were\r\nonce inured to plunder, they would break in, and ravage all Gaul.\" This\r\ndread was augmented by another: the enemy knew of the sedition in the\r\nRoman army, and were ready to invade the Empire, if its barrier the\r\nRhine were left unguarded. Now, to arm the allies and the auxiliaries of\r\nRome, and lead them against the departing legions, was to rouse a civil\r\nwar: severity was dangerous: the way of largesses infamous; and alike\r\nthreatening it was to the State to grant the turbulent soldiers nothing,\r\nor yield them everything. After revolving every reason and objection,\r\nthe result was, to feign letters and directions from Tiberius, \"that\r\nthose who had served twenty years should be finally discharged; such as\r\nserved sixteen be under the ensign and privileges of veterans, released\r\nfrom every duty but that of repulsing the enemy; and the legacy, which\r\nthey demanded, should be paid and doubled.\"\r\n\r\nThe soldiers, who perceived that, purely to evade present difficulty,\r\nthe concessions were forged, insisted to have them forthwith executed;\r\nand instantly the Tribunes despatched the discharge of the veterans:\r\nthat of the money was adjourned to their several winter quarters; but\r\nthe fifth legion, and the one-and-twentieth, refused to stir, till in\r\nthat very camp they were paid; so that out of the money reserved by\r\nhimself and his friends for travailing expenses, Germanicus was obliged\r\nto raise the sum. Caecina, Lieutenant-General, led the first legion and\r\ntwentieth back to the capital of the Ubians: an infamous march, when the\r\nplunder of their General's coffers was carried amidst the ensigns and\r\nRoman Eagles. Germanicus, the while, proceeding to the army in higher\r\nGermany, brought the second, thirteenth, and sixteenth legions to swear\r\nallegiance without hesitation: to the fourteenth, who manifested some\r\nshort suspense, he made unasked a tender of their money, and a present\r\ndischarge.\r\n\r\nBut a party of veterans which belonged to the disorderly legions, and\r\nthen in garrison among the Chaucians, as they began a sedition there,\r\nwere somewhat quelled by the instant execution of two of their body: an\r\nexecution this, commanded by Maenius, Camp-Marshal, and rather of good\r\nexample, than done by competent authority. The tumult, however, swelling\r\nagain with fresh rage, he fled, but was discovered; so that, finding\r\nno safety in lurking, from his own bravery he drew his defence, and\r\ndeclared \"that to himself, who was only their Camp-Marshal, these their\r\noutrages were not done, but done to the authority of Germanicus, their\r\nGeneral, to the majesty of Tiberius their Emperor.\" At the same time,\r\nbraving and dismaying all that would have stopped him, he fiercely\r\nsnatched the colours, faced about towards the Rhine, and pronouncing\r\nthe doom of traitors and deserters to every man who forsook his ranks,\r\nbrought them back to their winter quarters, mutinous, in truth, but not\r\ndaring to mutiny.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the deputies from the Senate met Germanicus at the\r\naltar of the Ubians [Footnote: Cologne.], whither in his return he was\r\narrived. Two legions wintered there, the first and twentieth, with the\r\nsoldiers lately placed under the standard of veterans; men already under\r\nthe distractions of guilt and fear: and now a new terror possessed them,\r\nthat these Senators were come armed with injunctions to cancel every\r\nconcession which they had by sedition extorted; and, as it is the custom\r\nof the crowd to be ever charging somebody with the crimes suggested by\r\ntheir own false alarms, the guilt of this imaginary decree they laid\r\nupon Minutius Plancus, a Senator of consular dignity, and at the head of\r\nthis deputation. In the dead of night, they began to clamour aloud for\r\nthe purple standard placed in the quarters of Germanicus, and, rushing\r\ntumultuously to his gate, burst the doors, dragged the Prince out of his\r\nbed, and, with menaces of present death, compelled him to deliver the\r\nstandard. Then, as they roved about the camp, they met the deputies,\r\nwho, having learnt the outrage, were hastening to Germanicus: upon\r\nthem they poured a deluge of contumelies, and to present slaughter were\r\ndevoting them, Plancus chiefly, whom the dignity of his character had\r\nrestrained from flight; nor in this mortal danger had he other refuge\r\nthan the quarters of the first legion, where, embracing the Eagle and\r\nother ensigns, he sought sanctuary from the religious veneration\r\never paid them. But, in spite of religion, had not Calpurnius, the\r\nEagle-bearer, by force defeated the last violence of the assault, in the\r\nRoman camp had been slain an ambassador of the Roman People, and\r\nwith his blood had been stained the inviolable altars of the Gods; a\r\nbarbarity rare even in the camp of an enemy. At last, day returning,\r\nwhen the General, and the soldiers, and their actions could be\r\ndistinguished, Germanicus entered the camp, and commanding Plancus to\r\nbe brought, seated him by himself upon the tribunal: he then inveighed\r\nagainst the late \"pernicious frenzy, which in it, he said, had fatality,\r\nand was rekindled by no despite in the soldiers, but by that of the\r\nangry Gods.\" He explained the genuine purposes of that embassy, and\r\nlamented with affecting eloquence \"the outrage committed upon Plancus,\r\naltogether brutal and unprovoked; the foul violence done to the sacred\r\nperson of an Ambassador, and the mighty disgrace from thence derived\r\nupon the legion.\" Yet as the assembly showed more stupefaction than\r\ncalmness, he dismissed the deputies under a guard of auxiliary horse.\r\n\r\nDuring this affright, Germanicus was by all men censured, \"that he\r\nretired not to the higher army, whence he had been sure of ready\r\nobedience, and even of succour against the revolters: already he had\r\ntaken wrong measures more than enow, by discharging some, rewarding all,\r\nand other tender counsels; if he despised his own safety, yet why expose\r\nhis infant son, why his wife big with child, to the fury of outrageous\r\ntraitors, wantonly violating all the most sacred rights amongst men? It\r\nbecame him at least to restore his wife and son safe to Tiberius and\r\nto the State.\" He was long unresolved; besides Agrippina was averse to\r\nleave him, and urged, that \"she was the grand-daughter of Augustus, and\r\nit was below her spirit to shrink in a time of danger.\" But embracing\r\nher and their little son, with great tenderness and many tears, he\r\nprevailed with her to depart. Thus there marched miserably along a band\r\nof helpless women: the wife of a great commander fled like a fugitive,\r\nand upon her bosom bore her infant son: about her a troop of other\r\nladies, dragged from their husbands, and drowned in tears, uttering\r\ntheir heavy lamentations; nor weaker than theirs was the grief felt by\r\nall who remained.\r\n\r\nThese groans and tears, and this spectacle of woe, the appearances\r\nrather of a city stormed and sacked, than of a Roman camp, that of\r\nGermanicus Caesar, victorious and flourishing, awakened attention and\r\ninquiry in the soldiers: leaving their tents, they cried, \"Whence these\r\ndoleful wailings? what so lamentable! so many ladies of illustrious\r\nquality, travelling thus forlorn; not a Centurion to attend them; not\r\na soldier to guard them; their General's wife amongst them,\r\nundistinguished by any mark of her princely dignity; destitute of her\r\nordinary train; frightened from the Roman legions, and repairing, like\r\nan exile, for shelter to Treves, there to commit herself to the faith\r\nof foreigners.\" Hence shame and commiseration seized them, and the\r\nremembrance of her illustrious family, with that of her own virtues;\r\nthe brave Agrippa her father; the mighty Augustus her grandfather; the\r\namiable Drusus her father-in-law, herself celebrated for a fruitful bed,\r\nand of signal chastity: add the consideration of her little son, born\r\nin the camp, nursed in the arms of the legions, and by themselves named\r\nCaligula, a military name from the boots which of the same fashion\r\nwith their own, in compliment to them, and to win their affections, he\r\nfrequently wore. But nothing so effectually subdued them as their own\r\nenvy towards the inhabitants of Treves: hence they all besought, all\r\nadjured, that she would return to themselves, and with themselves\r\nremain: thus some stopped Agrippina; but the main body returned with\r\ntheir entreaties to Germanicus, who, as he was yet in the transports\r\nof grief and anger, addressed himself on this wise to the surrounding\r\ncrowd.\r\n\r\n\"To me neither is my wife or son dearer than my father and the\r\nCommonwealth. But him doubtless the majesty of his name will defend; and\r\nthere are other armies, loyal armies, to defend the Roman State. As to\r\nmy wife and children, whom for your glory I could freely sacrifice, I\r\nnow remove them from your rage; that by my blood alone may be expiated\r\nwhatever further mischief your fury meditates; and that the murder of\r\nthe great grandson of Augustus, the murder of the daughter-in-law of\r\nTiberius, may not be added to mine, nor to the blackness of your past\r\nguilt. For, during these days of frenzy what has been too horrid for you\r\nto commit? What so sacred that you have not violated? To this audience\r\nwhat name shall I give? Can I call you _soldiers_? you who have beset\r\nwith arms the son of your Emperor, confined him in your trenches, and\r\nheld him in a siege? _Roman citizens_ can I call you? you who\r\nhave trampled upon the supreme authority of the Roman Senate? Laws\r\nreligiously observed by common enemies, you have profaned; violated\r\nthe sacred privileges, and persons of Ambassadors; broken the laws of\r\nnations. The deified Julius Caesar quelled a sedition in his army by a\r\nsingle word: he called all who refused to follow him, _townsmen_. The\r\ndeified Augustus, when, after the battle of Actium, the legions who won\r\nit lapsed into mutiny, terrified them into submission by the dignity\r\nof his presence and an awful look. These, it is true, are mighty and\r\nimmortal names, whom I dare not emulate; but, as I am their descendant,\r\nand inherit their blood, should the armies in Syria and Spain reject my\r\norders, and contemn my authority, I should think their behaviour strange\r\nand base: are not the present legions under stronger ties than those in\r\nSyria and Spain? You are the first and the twentieth legions; the former\r\nenrolled by Tiberius himself; the other his constant companions in so\r\nmany battles, his partners in so many victories, and by him enriched\r\nwith so many bounties! Is this the worthy return you make your Emperor,\r\nand late Commander, for the distinction he has shown you, for the favour\r\nhe has done you, and for his liberalities towards you? And shall I be\r\nthe author of such tidings to him; such heavy tidings in the midst of\r\ncongratulations and happy accounts from every province in the Empire?\r\nMust it be my sad task to acquaint him that his own new levies, as well\r\nas his own veterans who long fought under him; these not appeased by\r\ntheir discharge, and neither of them satiated with the money given them,\r\nare both still combined in a furious mutiny? must I tell him that here\r\nand only here the Centurions are butchered, the Tribunes driven away,\r\nthe Ambassadors imprisoned; that with blood the camp is stained, and\r\nthe rivers flow with blood; and that for me his son, I hold a precarious\r\nlife at the mercy of men, who owe me duty, and practise enmity?\r\n\r\n\"Why did you the other day, oh unseasonable and too officious friends!\r\nwhy did you leave me at their mercy by snatching from me my sword, when\r\nwith it I would have put myself out of their power? He who offered me\r\nhis own sword showed greater kindness, and was more my friend. I would\r\nthen have fallen happy; happy that my death would have hid from mine\r\neyes so many horrible crimes since committed by my own army; and for\r\nyou, you would have chosen another general, such a general, no doubt, as\r\nwould have left my death unpunished, but still one who would have sought\r\nvengeance for that of Varus and the three legions; for the Gods are too\r\njust to permit that ever the Belgians, however generously they offer\r\ntheir service, shall reap the credit and renown of retrieving the glory\r\nof the Roman name, and of reducing in behalf of Rome the German nations\r\nher foes. Filled with this passion for the glory of Rome, I here\r\ninvoke thy spirit now with the Gods, oh deified Augustus; and thy image\r\ninterwoven in the ensigns, and thy memory, oh deceased father. Let thy\r\nrevered spirit, oh Augustus, let thy loved image and memory, oh Drusus,\r\nstill dear to these legions, vindicate them from this guilty stain,\r\nthis foul infamy of leaving to foreigners the honour of defending\r\nand avenging the Roman State. They are Romans; they already feel the\r\nremorses of shame; they are already stimulated with a sense of honour:\r\nimprove, oh improve this generous disposition in them; that thus\r\ninspired they may turn the whole tide of their civil rage to the\r\ndestruction of their common enemy. And for you, my fellow-soldiers,\r\nin whom I behold all the marks of compunction, other countenances,\r\nand minds happily changed; if you mean to restore to the Senate its\r\nambassadors; to your Emperor your sworn obedience; to me, your general,\r\nmy wife and son; be it the first instance of your duty, to fly the\r\ncontagious company of incendiaries, to separate the sober from the\r\nseditious: this will be a faithful sign of remorse, this a firm pledge\r\nof fidelity.\"\r\n\r\nThese words softened them into supplicants: they confessed that all\r\nhis reproaches were true; they besought him to punish the guilty and\r\nmalicious, to pardon the weak and misled, and to lead them against the\r\nenemy; to recall his wife, to bring back his son, nor to suffer the\r\nfosterling of the legions to be given in hostage to the Gauls. Against\r\nthe recalling of Agrippina he alleged the advance of winter, and her\r\napproaching delivery; but said, that his son should return, and that\r\nto themselves he left to execute what remained further to be executed.\r\nInstantly, with changed resentments, they ran, and seizing the most\r\nseditious, dragged them in bonds to Caius Cretonius, commander of the\r\nfirst legion, who judged and punished them in this manner. The legions,\r\nwith their swords drawn, surrounded the tribunal; from thence the\r\nprisoner was by a Tribune exposed to their view, and if they\r\nproclaimed him guilty, cast headlong down, and executed even by his\r\nfellow-soldiers, who rejoiced in the execution, because by it they\r\nthought their own guilt to be expiated: nor did Germanicus restrain\r\nthem, since on themselves remained the cruelty and reproach of the\r\nslaughter committed without any order of his. The veterans followed the\r\nsame example of vengeance, and were soon after ordered into Rhetia, in\r\nappearance to defend that province against the invading Suevians; in\r\nreality, to remove them from a camp still horrible to their sight, as\r\nwell in the remedy and punishment, as from the memory of their crime.\r\nGermanicus next passed a scrutiny upon the conduct and characters of the\r\nCenturions: before him they were cited singly; and each gave an account\r\nof his name, his company, country, the length of his service, exploits\r\nin war, and military presents, if with any he had been distinguished:\r\nif the Tribunes or his legion bore testimony of his diligence and\r\nintegrity, he kept his post; upon concurring complaint of his avarice or\r\ncruelty, he was degraded.\r\n\r\nThus were the present commotions appeased; but others as great still\r\nsubsisted, from the rage and obstinacy of the fifth and twenty-first\r\nlegions. They were in winter quarters sixty miles off, in a place called\r\nthe Old Camp, [Footnote: Xanten.] and had first began the sedition: nor\r\nwas there any wickedness so horrid, that they had not perpetrated; nay,\r\nat this time, neither terrified by the punishment, nor reclaimed by the\r\nreformation of their fellow-soldiers, they persevered in their fury.\r\nGermanicus therefore determined to give them battle, if they persisted\r\nin their revolt; and prepared vessels, arms, and troops to be sent down\r\nthe Rhine.\r\n\r\nBefore the issue of the sedition in Illyricum was known at Rome, tidings\r\nof the uproar in the German legions arrived; hence the city was filled\r\nwith much terror; and hence against Tiberius many complaints, \"that\r\nwhile with feigned consultations and delays he mocked the Senate and\r\npeople, once the great bodies of the estate, but now bereft of power and\r\narmies, the soldiery were in open rebellion, one too mighty and stubborn\r\nto be quelled by two princes so young in years and authority: he\r\nought at first to have gone himself, and awed them with the majesty of\r\nimperial power, as doubtless they would have returned to duty upon the\r\nsight of their Emperor, a Prince of consummate experience, the sovereign\r\ndisposer of rewards and severity. Did Augustus, even under the pressure\r\nof old age and infirmities, take so many journeys into Germany? and\r\nshould Tiberius, in the vigour of his life, when the same or greater\r\noccasions called him thither, sit lazily in the Senate to watch senators\r\nand cavil at words? He had fully provided for the domestic servitude\r\nof Rome; he ought next to cure the licentiousness of the soldiers,\r\nto restrain their turbulent spirits, and reconcile them to a life of\r\npeace.\"\r\n\r\nBut all these reasonings and reproaches moved not Tiberius: he was\r\ndetermined not to depart from the capital, the centre of power and\r\naffairs; nor to chance or peril expose his person and empire. In truth,\r\nmany and contrary difficulties pressed and perplexed him: \"the German\r\narmy was the stronger; that of Pannonia nearer; the power of both the\r\nGauls supported the former; the latter was at the gates of Italy. Now to\r\nwhich should he repair first? and would not the last visited be inflamed\r\nby being postponed? But by sending one of his sons to each, the equal\r\ntreatment of both was maintained; as also the majesty of the supreme\r\npower, which from distance ever derived most reverence. Besides, the\r\nyoung princes would be excused, if to their father they referred such\r\ndemands as were for them improper to grant; and if they disobeyed\r\nGermanicus and Drusus, his own authority remained to appease or punish\r\nthem: but if once they had contemned their Emperor himself, what other\r\nresource was behind?\" However, as if he had been upon the point of\r\nmarching, he chose his attendance, provided his equipage, and prepared\r\na fleet: but by various delays and pretences, sometimes that of the\r\nwinter, sometimes business, he deceived for a time even the wisest men;\r\nmuch longer the common people, and the provinces for a great while.\r\n\r\nGermanicus had already drawn together his army, and was prepared to take\r\nvengeance on the seditious: but judging it proper to allow space for\r\ntrial, whether they would follow the late example, and consulting their\r\nown safety do justice upon one another, he sent letters to Caecina,\r\n\"that he himself approached, with a powerful force; and if they\r\nprevented him not, by executing the guilty, he would put all\r\nindifferently to the slaughter.\" These letters Caecina privately read\r\nto the principal officers, and such of the camp as the sedition had not\r\ntainted; besought them \"to redeem themselves from death, and all\r\nfrom infamy; urged that in peace alone reason was heard and merit\r\ndistinguished; but in the rage of war the blind steel spared the\r\ninnocent no more than the guilty.\" The officers, having tried those they\r\nbelieved for their purpose, and found the majority still to persevere\r\nin their duty, did, in concurrence with the General, settle the time for\r\nfalling with the sword upon the most notoriously guilty and turbulent.\r\nUpon a particular signal given they rushed into their tents and\r\nbutchered them, void as they were of all apprehension; nor did any but\r\nthe centurions and executioners know whence the massacre began, or where\r\nit would end.\r\n\r\nThis had a different face from all the civil slaughters that ever\r\nhappened: it was a slaughter not of enemies upon enemies, nor from\r\ndifferent and opposite camps, nor in a day of battle; but of comrades\r\nupon comrades, in the same tents where they ate together by day, where\r\nthey slept together by night. From this state of intimacy they flew\r\ninto mortal enmity, and friends launched their darts at friends: wounds,\r\noutcries, and blood were open to view; but the cause remained hid: wild\r\nchance governed the rest, and several innocents were slain. For the\r\ncriminals, when they found against whom all this fury was bent, had also\r\nbetaken themselves to their arms; neither did Caecina, nor any of the\r\nTribunes, intervene to stay the rage; so that the soldiers had full\r\npermission to vengeance, and a licentious satiety of killing. Germanicus\r\nsoon after entered the camp now full of blood and carcasses, and\r\nlamenting with many tears that \"this was not a remedy, but cruelty\r\nand desolation,\" commanded the bodies to be burnt. Their minds, still\r\ntempestuous and bloody, were transported with sudden eagerness to attack\r\nthe foe, as the best expiation of their tragical fury: nor otherwise,\r\nthey thought, could the ghosts of their butchered brethren be appeased,\r\nthan by receiving in their own profane breasts a chastisement of\r\nhonourable wounds. Germanicus fell in with the ardour of the soldiers,\r\nand laying a bridge upon the Rhine, marched over twelve thousand\r\nlegionary soldiers, twenty-six cohorts of the allies, and eight\r\nregiments of horse; men all untainted in the late sedition.\r\n\r\nThe Germans rejoiced, not far off, at this vacation of war, occasioned\r\nfirst by the death of Augustus, and afterwards by intestine tumults in\r\nthe camp; but the Romans by a hasty march passed through the Caesian\r\nwoods, and levelling the barrier formerly begun by Tiberius, upon\r\nit pitched their camp. In the front and rear they were defended by a\r\npalisade; on each side by a barricade of the trunks of trees felled.\r\nFrom thence, beginning to traverse gloomy forests, they stopped to\r\nconsult which of two ways they should choose, the short and frequented,\r\nor the longest and least known, and therefore unsuspected by the\r\nfoe: the longest way was chosen; but in everything else despatch was\r\nobserved; for by the scouts intelligence was brought that the Germans\r\ndid, that night, celebrate a festival with great mirth and revelling.\r\nHence Caecina was commanded to advance with the cohorts without their\r\nbaggage, and to clear a passage through the forest: at a moderate\r\ndistance followed the legions; the clearness of the night facilitated\r\nthe march, and they arrived at the villages of the Marsians, which with\r\nguards they presently invested. The Germans were even yet under the\r\neffects of their debauch, scattered here and there, some in bed, some\r\nlying by their tables; no watch placed, no apprehension of an enemy. So\r\nutterly had their false security banished all order and care; and they\r\nwere under no dread of war, without enjoying peace, other than the\r\ndeceitful and lethargic peace of drunkards.\r\n\r\nThe legions were eager for revenge; and Germanicus, to extend their\r\nravage, divided them into four battalions. The country was wasted by\r\nfire and sword fifty miles round; nor sex nor age found mercy; places\r\nsacred and profane had the equal lot of destruction, all razed to the\r\nground, and with them the temple of Tanfana, of all others the most\r\ncelebrated amongst these nations: nor did all this execution cost the\r\nsoldiers a wound, while they only slew men half asleep, disarmed, or\r\ndispersed. This slaughter roused the Bructerans, the Tubantes, and the\r\nUsipetes; and they beset the passes of the forest, through which the\r\narmy was to return: an event known to Germanicus, and he marched in\r\norder of battle. The auxiliary cohorts and part of the horse led the\r\nvan, followed close by the first legion; the baggage was in the middle;\r\nthe twenty-first legion closed the left wing, and the fifth the right;\r\nthe twentieth defended the rear; and after them marched the rest of the\r\nallies. But the enemy stirred not, till the body of the army entered\r\nthe wood: they then began lightly to insult the front and wings; and at\r\nlast, with their whole force, fell upon the rear. The light cohorts were\r\nalready disordered by the close German bands, when Germanicus riding up\r\nto the twentieth legion, and exalting his voice, \"This was the season,\"\r\nhe cried, \"to obliterate the scandal of sedition: hence they should\r\nfall resolutely on, and into sudden praise convert their late shame and\r\noffence.\" These words inflamed them: at one charge they broke the enemy,\r\ndrove them out of the wood, and slaughtered them in the plain. In the\r\nmeanwhile, the front passed the forest, and fortified the camp: the rest\r\nof the march was uninterrupted; and the soldiers, trusting to the merit\r\nof their late exploits, and forgetting at once past faults and terrors,\r\nwere placed in winter quarters.\r\n\r\nThe tidings of these exploits affected Tiberius with gladness and\r\nanguish: he rejoiced that the sedition was suppressed; but that\r\nGermanicus had, by discharging the veterans, by shortening the term of\r\nservice to the rest, and by largesses to all, gained the hearts of the\r\narmy, as well as earned high glory in war, proved to the Emperor matter\r\nof torture. To the Senate, however, he reported the detail of his feats,\r\nand upon his valour bestowed copious praises, but in words too pompous\r\nand ornamental to be believed dictated by his heart. It was with more\r\nbrevity that he commended Drusus, and his address in quelling the\r\nsedition of Illyricum, but more cordially withal, and in language\r\naltogether sincere; and even to the Pannonian legions he extended all\r\nthe concessions made by Germanicus to his own.\r\n\r\nThere was this year an admission of new rites, by the establishment\r\nof another College of Priests, one sacred to the deity of Augustus; as\r\nformerly Titus Tatius, to preserve the religious rites of the Sabines,\r\nhad founded the fraternity of Titian Priests. To fill the society,\r\none-and-twenty, the most considerable Romans were drawn by lot, and\r\nto them added Tiberius, Drusus, Claudius, and Germanicus. The games in\r\nhonour of Augustus began then first to be embroiled by emulation among\r\nthe players, and the strife of parties in their behalf. Augustus had\r\ncountenanced these players and their art, in complaisance to Maecenas,\r\nwho was mad in love with Bathyllus the comedian; nor to such favourite\r\namusements of the populace had he any aversion himself; he rather judged\r\nit an acceptable courtesy to mingle with the multitude in these their\r\npopular pleasures. Different was the temper of Tiberius, different\r\nhis politics: to severer manners, however, he durst not yet reduce the\r\npeople, so many years indulged in licentious gaieties.\r\n\r\nIn the consulship of Drusus Caesar and Caius Norbanus, a triumph was\r\ndecreed to Germanicus, while the war still subsisted. He was preparing\r\nwith all diligence to prosecute it the following summer; but began much\r\nsooner by a sudden irruption early in the spring into the territories of\r\nthe Cattans: an anticipation of the campaign, which proceeded from the\r\nhopes given him of dissension amongst the enemy, caused by the opposite\r\nparties of Arminius and Segestes; two men signally known to the Romans\r\nupon different accounts; the last for his firm faith, the first for\r\nfaith violated. Arminius was the incendiary of Germany; but by Segestes\r\nhad been given repeated warnings of an intended revolt, particularly\r\nduring the festival immediately preceding the insurrection: he had even\r\nadvised Varus \"to secure himself and Arminius, and all the other chiefs;\r\nfor that the multitude, thus bereft of their leaders, would dare to\r\nattempt nothing; and Varus have time to distinguish crimes and such\r\nas committed none.\" But by his own fate, and the sudden violence of\r\nArminius, Varus fell. Segestes, though by the weight and unanimity of\r\nhis nation he was forced into the war, yet remained at constant variance\r\nwith Arminius: a domestic quarrel too heightened their hate, as Arminius\r\nhad carried away the daughter of Segestes, already betrothed to another;\r\nand the same relations, which amongst friends prove bonds of tenderness,\r\nwere fresh stimulations of wrath to an obnoxious son and an offended\r\nfather.\r\n\r\nUpon these encouragements, Germanicus to the command of Caecina\r\ncommitted four legions, five thousand auxiliaries, and some bands of\r\nGermans, dwellers on this side the Rhine, drawn suddenly together;\r\nhe led himself as many legions with double the number of allies, and\r\nerecting a fort in Mount Taunus, [Footnote: Near Homburg.] upon the old\r\nfoundations of one raised by his father, rushed full march against the\r\nCattans; having behind him left Lucius Apronius, to secure the ways from\r\nthe fury of inundations: for as the roads were then dry and the rivers\r\nlow, events in that climate exceeding rare, he had without check\r\nexpedited his march; but against his return apprehended the violence of\r\nrains and floods. Upon the Cattans he fell with such surprise, that all\r\nthe weak through sex or age were instantly taken or slaughtered: their\r\nyouth, by swimming over the Adrana, [Footnote: Eder.] escaped, and\r\nattempted to force the Romans from building a bridge to follow them, but\r\nby dint of arrows and engines were repulsed; and then, having in vain\r\ntried to gain terms of peace, some submitted to Germanicus; the rest\r\nabandoned their villages and dwellings, and dispersed themselves in the\r\nwoods. Mattium, [Footnote: Maden.] the capital of the nation, he burnt,\r\nravaged all the open country, and bent his march to the Rhine; nor durst\r\nthe enemy harass his rear, an usual practice of theirs, when sometimes\r\nthey fly more through craft than affright. The Cheruscans indeed were\r\naddicted to assist the Cattans, but terrified from attempting it by\r\nCaecina, who moved about with his forces from place to place; and by\r\nrouting the Marsians who had dared to engage him, restrained all their\r\nefforts.\r\n\r\nSoon after arrived deputies from Segestes, praying relief against\r\nthe combination and violence of his countrymen, by whom he was held\r\nbesieged; as more powerful amongst them than his was the credit of\r\nArminius, since it was he who had advised the war. The genius this of\r\nbarbarians, to judge that men are to be trusted in proportion as they\r\nare fierce, and in public commotions ever to prefer the most resolute.\r\nTo the other deputies Segestes had added Segimundus, his son; but the\r\nyoung man faltered a while, as his own heart accused him; for that\r\nthe year when Germany revolted, he, who had been by the Romans created\r\nPriest of the altar of the Ubians, rent the sacerdotal tiara and fled to\r\nthe revolters: yet, encouraged by the Roman clemency, he undertook the\r\nexecution of his father's orders, was himself graciously received, and\r\nthen conducted with a guard to the frontiers of Gaul. Germanicus led\r\nback his army to the relief of Segestes, and was rewarded with success.\r\nHe fought the besiegers, and rescued him with a great train of his\r\nrelations and followers; amongst them too were ladies of illustrious\r\nrank, particularly the wife of Arminius, the same who was the daughter\r\nof Segestes: a lady more of the spirit of her husband than that of her\r\nfather; a spirit so unsubdued, that from her eyes captivity forced not\r\na tear, nor from her lips a breath in the style of a supplicant: not a\r\nmotion of her hands, nor a look escaped her; but, fast across her breast\r\nshe held her arms, and upon her heavy womb her eyes were immovably\r\nfixed. There were likewise carried Roman spoils taken at the slaughter\r\nof Varus and his army, and then divided as prey amongst many of those\r\nwho were now prisoners: at the same time appeared Segestes, of superior\r\nstature; and from a confidence in his good understanding with the\r\nRomans, undaunted. In this manner he spoke:\r\n\r\n\"It is not the first day this, that to the Roman People I have approved\r\nmy faith and adherence: from the moment I was by the deified Augustus\r\npresented with the freedom of the city, I have continued by your\r\ninterest to choose my friends, by your interest to denominate my\r\nenemies; from no hate of mine to my native country (for odious are\r\ntraitors even to the party they embrace), but because the same measures\r\nwere equally conducing to the benefit of the Romans and of the Germans;\r\nand I was rather for peace than war. For this reason to Varus, the then\r\nGeneral, I applied, with an accusation against Arminius, who from me had\r\nravished my daughter, and with you violated the faith of leagues: but\r\ngrowing impatient with the slowness and inactivity of Varus, and well\r\napprised how little security was to be hoped from the laws, I pressed\r\nhim to seize myself, and Arminius, and his accomplices: witness that\r\nfatal night, to me I wish it had been the last! more to be lamented than\r\ndefended are the sad events which followed. I moreover cast Arminius\r\ninto irons, and was myself cast into irons by his faction; and as soon\r\nas to you, Caesar, I could apply, you see I prefer old engagements to\r\npresent violence, and tranquillity to combustions, with no view of\r\nmy own to interest or reward, but to banish from me the imputation\r\nof perfidiousness. For the German nation, too, I would thus become a\r\nmediator, if peradventure they will choose rather to repent than be\r\ndestroyed: for my son, I intreat you, have mercy upon his youth, and\r\npardon his error; that my daughter is your prisoner by force I own: in\r\nyour breast it wholly lies under which character you will treat her,\r\nwhether as one by Arminius impregnated, or by me begotten.\" The answer\r\nof Germanicus was gracious: he promised indemnity to his children and\r\nkindred, and to himself a safe retreat in one of the old provinces; then\r\nreturned with his army, and by the direction of Tiberius, received the\r\ntitle of _Imperator_. The wife of Arminius brought forth a male child,\r\nand the boy was brought up at Ravenna; his unhappy conflicts afterwards,\r\nwith the contumelious insults of fortune, will be remembered in their\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nThe desertion of Segestes being divulged, with his gracious reception\r\nfrom Germanicus, affected his countrymen variously; with hope or\r\nanguish, as they were prone or averse to the war. Naturally violent was\r\nthe spirit of Arminius, and now, by the captivity of his wife, by the\r\nfate of his child doomed to bondage though yet unborn, enraged even to\r\ndistraction: he flew about amongst the Cheruscans, calling them to arms;\r\nto arm against Segestes, to arm against Germanicus. Invectives followed\r\nhis fury; \"A blessed father this Segestes,\" he cried! \"a mighty general\r\nthis Germanicus! invincible warriors these Romans! so many troops have\r\nmade prisoner of a woman. It is not thus that I conquer; before me three\r\nlegions fell, and three lieutenant-generals. Open and honourable is my\r\nmethod of war, nor waged with big-bellied women, but against men and\r\narms; and treason is none of my weapons. Still to be seen are the Roman\r\nstandards in the German groves, there by me hung up and devoted to our\r\ncountry Gods. Let Segestes live a slave in a conquered province; let him\r\nto his son recover a foreign priesthood: with the German nations he can\r\nnever obliterate his reproach, that through him they have seen between\r\nthe Elbe and Rhine rods and axes, and the Roman toga. To other nations\r\nwho know not the Roman domination, executions and tributes are also\r\nunknown; evils which we too have cast off, in spite of that Augustus now\r\ndead and enrolled with the Deities; in spite too of Tiberius, his\r\nchosen successor: let us not after this dread a mutinous army, and a boy\r\nwithout experience, their commander; but if you love your country, your\r\nkindred, your ancient liberty and laws, better than tyrants and new\r\ncolonies, let Arminius rather lead you to liberty and glory, than the\r\nwicked Segestes to the infamy of bondage.\"\r\n\r\nBy these stimulations, not the Cheruscans only were roused, but all the\r\nneighbouring nations; and into the confederacy was drawn Inguiomerus,\r\npaternal uncle to Arminius, a man long since in high credit with the\r\nRomans: hence a new source of fear to Germanicus, who, to avoid the\r\nshock of their whole forces, and to divert the enemy, sent Caecina with\r\nforty Roman cohorts to the river Amisia, [Footnote: Ems.] through the\r\nterritories of the Bructerans. Pedo the Prefect led the cavalry by the\r\nconfines of the Frisians: he himself, on the lake, [Footnote: The Zuyder\r\nZee.] embarked four legions; and upon the bank of the said river the\r\nwhole body met, foot, horse, and fleet. The Chaucians, upon offering\r\ntheir assistance, were taken into the service; but the Bructerans,\r\nsetting fire to their effects and dwellings, were routed by Stertinius,\r\nby Germanicus despatched against them with a band lightly armed. As this\r\nparty were engaged between slaughter and plunder, he found the Eagle of\r\nthe nineteenth legion lost in the overthrow of Varus. The army marched\r\nnext to the farthest borders of the Bructerans, and the whole country\r\nbetween the rivers Amisia and Luppia [Footnote: Lippe.] was laid waste.\r\nNot far hence lay the forest of Teutoburgium, and in it the bones of\r\nVarus and the legions, by report still unburied.\r\n\r\nHence Germanicus became inspired with a tender passion to pay the\r\nlast offices to the legions and their leader; the like tenderness also\r\naffected the whole army. They were moved with compassion, some for\r\nthe fate of their friends, others for that of their relations here\r\ntragically slain; they were struck with the doleful casualties of war,\r\nand the sad lot of humanity. Caecina was sent before to examine the\r\ngloomy recesses of the forest; to lay bridges over the pools; and upon\r\nthe deceitful marshes, causeways. The army entered the doleful solitude,\r\nhideous to sight, hideous to memory. First they saw the camp of Varus,\r\nwide in circumference; and the three distinct spaces, allotted to the\r\ndifferent Eagles, showed the number of the legions. Further, they\r\nbeheld the ruinous entrenchment, and the ditch nigh choked up: in it the\r\nremains of the army were supposed to have made their last effort, and\r\nin it to have found their graves. In the open fields lay their bones\r\nall bleached and bare, some separate, some on heaps; just as they had\r\nhappened to fall, flying for their lives, or resisting unto death. Here\r\nwere scattered the limbs of horses, there pieces of broken javelins; and\r\nthe trunks of trees bore the skulls of men. In the adjacent groves were\r\nthe savage altars; where, of the tribunes and principal centurions,\r\nthe barbarians had made a horrible immolation. Those who survived the\r\nslaughter, having escaped from captivity and the sword, related the sad\r\nparticulars to the rest: \"Here the commanders of the legions were slain;\r\nthere we lost the Eagles; here Varus had his first wound; there he gave\r\nhimself another, and perished by his own unhappy hand. In that place,\r\ntoo, stood the tribunal whence Arminius harangued; in this quarter, for\r\nthe execution of his captives, he erected so many gibbets; in that such\r\na number of funeral trenches were digged; and with these circumstances\r\nof pride and despite he insulted the ensigns and Eagles.\"\r\n\r\nThus the Roman army buried the bones of the three legions, six years\r\nafter the slaughter: nor could any one distinguish whether he gathered\r\nthe particular remains of a stranger, or those of a kinsman; but all\r\nconsidered the whole as their friends, the whole as their relations;\r\nwith heightened resentments against the foe, at once sad and revengeful.\r\nIn this pious office, so acceptable to the dead, Germanicus was a\r\npartner in the woe of the living; and upon the common tomb laid the\r\nfirst sod: a proceeding not liked by Tiberius; whether it were that upon\r\nevery action of Germanicus he put a perverse meaning, or believed that\r\nthe affecting spectacle of the unburied slain would sink the spirit\r\nof the army, and heighten their terror of the enemy; as also that \"a\r\ngeneral vested, as Augur, with the intendency of religious rites, became\r\ndefiled by touching the solemnities of the dead.\"\r\n\r\nArminius, retiring into desert and pathless places, was pursued by\r\nGermanicus; who, as soon as he reached him, commanded the horse to\r\nadvance, and dislodge the enemy from the post they had possessed.\r\nArminius, having directed his men to keep close together, and draw near\r\nto the woods, wheeled suddenly about, and to those whom he had hid in\r\nthe forest gave the signal to rush out: the Roman horse, now engaged\r\nby a new army, became disordered, and to their relief some cohorts were\r\nsent, but likewise broken by the press of those that fled; and great\r\nwas the consternation so many ways increased. The enemy too were already\r\npushing them into the morass, a place well known to the pursuers, as to\r\nthe unapprised Romans it had proved pernicious, had not Germanicus drawn\r\nout the legions in order of battle. Hence the enemy became terrified,\r\nour men reassured, and both retired with equal loss and advantage.\r\nGermanicus presently after returning with the army to the river Amisia,\r\nreconducted the legions, as he had brought them, in the fleet: part\r\nof the horse were ordered to march along the sea-shore to the Rhine.\r\nCaecina, who led his own men, was warned, that though he was to return\r\nthrough unknown roads, yet he should with all speed pass the causeway\r\ncalled the long bridges: it is a narrow track this, between vast\r\nmarshes, and formerly raised by Lucius Domitius. The marshes themselves\r\nare of an uncertain soil, here full of mud, there of heavy sticking\r\nclay, or traversed with various currents. Round about are woods which\r\nrise gently from the plain, and were already filled with soldiers by\r\nArminius; who, by shorter ways and a running march, had arrived there\r\nbefore our men, who were loaded with arms and baggage. Caecina, who was\r\nperplexed how at once to repair the causeway decayed by time, and to\r\nrepulse the foe, resolved at last to encamp in the place, that whilst\r\nsome were employed in the work, others might maintain the fight.\r\n\r\nThe Barbarians strove violently to break our station, and to fall upon\r\nthe entrenchers: they harassed our men, assaulted the works, changed\r\ntheir attacks, and pushed everywhere. With the shouts of the assailants,\r\nthe cries of the workmen were confusedly mixed; and all things equally\r\ncombined to distress the Romans: the place deep with ooze sinking under\r\nthose who stood, slippery to such as advanced; their armour heavy;\r\nthe waters deep, nor could they in them launch their javelins. The\r\nCheruscans, on the contrary, were inured to encounters in the bogs;\r\ntheir persons tall, their spears long, such as could wound at a\r\ndistance. At last the legions, already yielding, were by night redeemed\r\nfrom an unequal combat; but night interrupted not the activity of the\r\nGermans, become by success indefatigable. Without refreshing themselves\r\nwith sleep, they diverted all the courses of the springs which rise in\r\nthe neighbouring mountains, and turned them into the plains: thus\r\nthe Roman camp was flooded, the work, as far as they had carried it,\r\noverturned, and the labour of the poor soldiers renewed and doubled. To\r\nCaecina this year proved the fortieth of his sustaining as officer or\r\nsoldier the functions of arms; a man in all the vicissitudes of war,\r\nprosperous or disastrous, well experienced and thence undaunted.\r\nWeighing, therefore, with himself all probable events and expedients, he\r\ncould devise no other than that of restraining the enemy to the woods,\r\ntill he had sent forward the wounded men and baggage; for, from the\r\nmountains to the marshes there stretched a plain fit only to hold a\r\nlittle army: to this purpose the legions were thus appointed; the fifth\r\nhad the right wing, and the one-and-twentieth the left; the first led\r\nthe van; the twentieth defended the rear.\r\n\r\nA restless night it was to both armies, but in different ways; the\r\nBarbarians feasted and caroused, and with songs of triumph, or with\r\nhorrid and threatening cries, filled all the plain and echoing woods.\r\nAmongst the Romans were feeble fires, sad silence, or broken words;\r\nthey leaned drooping here and there against the pales, or wandered\r\ndisconsolately about the tents, like men without sleep, but not quite\r\nawake. A frightful dream too terrified the General; he thought he heard\r\nand saw Quinctilius Varus, rising out of the marsh all besmeared with\r\nblood, stretching forth his hand, and calling upon him; but that he\r\nrejected the call and pushed him away. At break of day, the legions\r\nposted on the wings, through contumacy or affright, deserted their\r\nstations, and took sudden possession of a field beyond the bogs. Neither\r\ndid Arminius fall straight upon them, however open they lay to his\r\nassault; but, when he perceived the baggage set fast in mire and\r\nditches, the soldiers above it disorderly and embarrassed, the ranks and\r\nensigns in confusion, and, as usual in a time of distress, every one in\r\nhaste to save himself, but slow to obey his officer, he then commanded\r\nhis Germans to break in, \"Behold,\" he vehemently cried; \"behold again\r\nVarus and his legions subdued by the same fate.\" Thus he cried, and\r\ninstantly with a select body broke quite through our forces, and chiefly\r\nagainst the horse directed his havoc; so that the ground becoming\r\nslippery by their blood and the slime of the marsh, their feet flew from\r\nthem, and they cast their riders; then galloping and stumbling amongst\r\nthe ranks, they overthrew all they met, and trod to death all they\r\noverthrew. The greatest difficulty was to maintain the Eagles; a storm\r\nof darts made it impossible to advance them, and the rotten ground\r\nimpossible to fix them. Caecina, while he sustained the fight, had his\r\nhorse shot, and having fallen was nigh taken; but the first legion\r\nsaved him. Our relief came from the greediness of the enemy, who ceased\r\nslaying to seize the spoil: hence the legions had respite to struggle\r\ninto the fair field and firm ground. Nor was here an end of their\r\nmiseries: a palisade was to be raised, an entrenchment digged; their\r\ninstruments too for throwing up and carrying earth, and their tools\r\nfor cutting turf, were almost all lost; no tents for the soldiers; no\r\nremedies for the wounded; and their food all defiled with mire or blood.\r\nAs they shared it in sadness amongst them, they lamented that mournful\r\nnight, they lamented the approaching day, to so many thousand men the\r\nlast.\r\n\r\nIt happened that a horse, which had broke his collar as he strayed\r\nabout, became frightened with noise, and ran over some that were in his\r\nway: this raised such a consternation in the camp, from a persuasion\r\nthat the Germans in a body had forced an entrance, that all rushed to\r\nthe gates, especially to the postern, as the farthest from the foe, and\r\nsafer for flight. Caecina having found the vanity of their dread, but\r\nunable to stop them, either by his authority, or by his prayers, or\r\nindeed by force, flung himself at last across the gate. This prevailed;\r\ntheir awe and tenderness of their General restrained them from running\r\nover his body; and the Tribunes and Centurions satisfied them the while,\r\nthat it was a false alarm.\r\n\r\nThen calling them together, and desiring them to hear him with silence,\r\nhe reminded them of their difficulties, and how to conquer them: \"That\r\nfor their lives they must be indebted to their arms, but force was to\r\nbe tempered with art; they must therefore keep close within their camp,\r\ntill the enemy, in hopes of taking it by storm, advanced; then make a\r\nsudden sally on every side, and by this push they should break through\r\nthe enemy, and reach the Rhine. But if they fled, more forests remained\r\nto be traversed, deeper marshes to be passed, and the cruelty of a\r\npursuing foe to be sustained.\" He laid before them the motives and\r\nfruits of victory, public rewards and glory, with every tender domestic\r\nconsideration, as well as those of military exploits and praise. Of\r\ntheir dangers and sufferings he said nothing. He next distributed\r\nhorses, first his own, then those of the Tribunes and leaders of the\r\nlegions, to the bravest soldiers impartially; that thus mounted they\r\nmight begin the charge, followed by the foot.\r\n\r\nAmongst the Germans there was not less agitation, from hopes of victory,\r\ngreediness of spoil, and the opposite counsels of their leaders.\r\nArminius proposed \"to let the Romans march off, and to beset them\r\nin their march, when engaged in bogs and fastnesses.\" The advice of\r\nInguiomerus was fiercer, and thence by the Barbarians more applauded:\r\nhe declared \"for forcing the camp, for that the victory would be quick,\r\nthere would be more captives, and entire plunder.\" As soon, therefore,\r\nas it was light, they rushed out upon the camp, cast hurdles into\r\nthe ditch, attacked and grappled the palisade. Upon it few soldiers\r\nappeared, and these seemed frozen with fear; but as the enemy was in\r\nswarms, climbing the ramparts, the signal was given to the cohorts;\r\nthe cornets and trumpets sounded, and instantly, with shouts and\r\nimpetuosity, they issued out and begirt the assailants. \"Here are no\r\nthickets,\" they scornfully cried; \"no bogs; but an equal field and\r\nimpartial Gods.\" The enemy, who imagined few Romans remaining, fewer\r\narms, and an easy conquest, were struck with the sounding trumpets, with\r\nthe glittering armour; and every object of terror appeared double to\r\nthem who expected none. They fell like men who, as they are void of\r\nmoderation in prosperity, are also destitute of conduct in distress.\r\nArminius forsook the fight unhurt; Inguiomerus grievously wounded; their\r\nmen were slaughtered as long as day and rage lasted. In the evening the\r\nlegions returned, in the same want of provisions, and with more wounds;\r\nbut in victory they found all things, health, vigour, and abundance.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime a report had flown, that the Roman forces were routed,\r\nand an army of Germans upon full march to invade Gaul; so that under\r\nthe terror of this news there were those whose cowardice would have\r\nemboldened them to have demolished the bridge upon the Rhine, had not\r\nAgrippina restrained them from that infamous attempt. In truth, such was\r\nthe undaunted spirit of the woman, that at this time she performed all\r\nthe duties of a general, relieved the necessitous soldiers, upon the\r\nwounded bestowed medicines, and upon others clothes. Caius Plinius,\r\nthe writer of the German wars, relates that she stood at the end of\r\nthe bridge, as the legions returned, and accosted them with thanks and\r\npraises; a behaviour which sunk deep into the spirit of Tiberius: \"For\r\nthat all this officiousness of hers,\" he thought, \"could not be upright;\r\nnor that it was against foreigners only she engaged the army. To the\r\ndirection of the generals nothing was now left, when a woman reviewed\r\nthe companies, attended the Eagles, and to the men distributed\r\nlargesses: as if before she had shown but small tokens of ambitious\r\ndesigns, in carrying her child (the son of the General) in a soldier's\r\ncoat about the camp, with the title of Caesar Caligula: already in\r\ngreater credit with the army was Agrippina than the leaders of the\r\nlegions, in greater than their generals; and a woman had suppressed\r\nsedition, which the authority of the Emperor was not able to restrain.\"\r\nThese jealousies were inflamed, and more were added, by Sejanus; one who\r\nwas well skilled in the temper of Tiberius, and purposely furnished him\r\nwith sources of hatred, to lie hid in his heart, and be discharged with\r\nincrease hereafter. Germanicus, in order to lighten the ships in which\r\nhe had embarked his men, and fit their burden to the ebbs and shallows,\r\ndelivered the second and fourteenth legions to Publius Vitellius, to\r\nlead them by land. Vitellius at first had an easy march on dry ground,\r\nor ground moderately overflowed by the tide, when suddenly the fury of\r\nthe north wind swelling the ocean (a constant effect of the equinox) the\r\nlegions were surrounded and tossed with the tide, and the land was all\r\non flood; the sea, the shore, the fields, had the same tempestuous face;\r\nno distinction of depths from shallows; none of firm, from deceitful,\r\nfooting. They were overturned by the billows, swallowed down by the\r\neddies; and horses, baggage, and drowned men encountered each other,\r\nand floated together. The several companies were mixed at random by\r\nthe waves; they waded, now breast high, now up to the chin, and as the\r\nground failed them, they fell, some never more to rise. Their cries and\r\nmutual encouragements availed them nothing against the prevailing and\r\ninexorable waves; no difference between the coward and the brave, the\r\nwise and the foolish; none between circumspection and chance; but\r\nall were equally involved in the invincible violence of the flood.\r\nVitellius, at length struggling on to an eminence, drew the legions\r\nthither, where they passed the cold night without fire, and destitute of\r\nevery convenience; most of them naked or lamed; not less miserable than\r\nmen enclosed by an enemy; for even to such remained the consolation of\r\nan honourable death; but here was destruction every way void of glory.\r\nThe land returned with the day, and they marched to the river Vidrus,\r\n[Footnote: Weser.] whither Germanicus had gone with the fleet. There the\r\ntwo legions were again embarked, when fame had given them for drowned;\r\nnor was their escape believed till Germanicus and the army were seen to\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nStertinius, who in the meanwhile had been sent before to receive\r\nSigimerus, the brother of Segestes (a prince willing to surrender\r\nhimself) brought him and his son to the city of the Ubians. Both were\r\npardoned; the father freely, the son with more difficulty, because he\r\nwas said to have insulted the corpse of Varus. For the rest, Spain,\r\nItaly, and both the Gauls strove with emulation to supply the losses of\r\nthe army; and offered arms, horses, money, according as each abounded.\r\nGermanicus applauded their zeal; but accepted only the horses and\r\narms for the service of the war. With his own money he relieved the\r\nnecessities of the soldiers: and to soften also by his kindness the\r\nmemory of the late havoc, he visited the wounded, extolled the exploits\r\nof particulars, viewed their wounds, with hopes encouraged some, with\r\na sense of glory animated others; and by affability and tenderness\r\nconfirmed them all in devotion to himself and to his fortune in war.\r\n\r\nThe ornaments of triumph were this year decreed to Aulus Caecina, Lucius\r\nApronius, and Caius Silius, for their services under Germanicus. The\r\ntitle of Father of his Country, so often offered by the people to\r\nTiberius, was rejected by him; nor would he permit swearing upon his\r\nacts, though the same was voted by the Senate. Against it he urged \"the\r\ninstability of all mortal things, and that the higher he was raised\r\nthe more slippery he stood.\" But for all this ostentation of a popular\r\nspirit, he acquired not the reputation of possessing it, for he had\r\nrevived the law concerning violated majesty; a law which, in the days\r\nof our ancestors, had indeed the same name, but implied different\r\narraignments and crimes, namely, those against the State; as when an\r\narmy was betrayed abroad, when seditions were raised at home; in short,\r\nwhen the public was faithlessly administered and the majesty of the\r\nRoman People was debased: these were actions, and actions were punished,\r\nbut words were free. Augustus was the first who brought libels under the\r\npenalties of this wrested law, incensed as he was by the insolence of\r\nCassius Severus, who had in his writings wantonly defamed men and ladies\r\nof illustrious quality. Tiberius too afterwards, when Pompeius Macer,\r\nthe Praetor, consulted him \"whether process should be granted upon\r\nthis law?\" answered, \"That the laws must be executed.\" He also\r\nwas exasperated by satirical verses written by unknown authors and\r\ndispersed; exposing his cruelty, his pride, and his mind naturally\r\nalienated from his mother.\r\n\r\nIt will be worth while to relate here the pretended crimes charged upon\r\nFalanius and Rubrius, two Roman knights of small fortunes; that hence\r\nmay be seen from what beginnings, and by how much dark art of Tiberius,\r\nthis grievous mischief crept in; how it was again restrained; how at\r\nlast it blazed out and consumed all things. To Falanius was objected\r\nby his accusers, that \"amongst the adorers of Augustus, who went in\r\nfraternities from house to house, he had admitted one Cassius, a mimic\r\nand prostitute; and having sold his gardens, had likewise with them sold\r\nthe statue of Augustus.\" The crime imputed to Rubrius was, \"That he had\r\nsworn falsely by the divinity of Augustus.\" When these accusations\r\nwere known to Tiberius, he wrote to the consuls, \"That Heaven was not\r\ntherefore decreed to his father, that the worship of him might be a\r\nsnare to the citizens of Rome; that Cassius, the player, was wont to\r\nassist with others of his profession at the interludes consecrated by\r\nhis mother to the memory of Augustus: neither did it affect religion,\r\nthat his effigies, like other images of the Gods, were comprehended in\r\nthe sale of houses and gardens. As to the false swearing by his name,\r\nit was to be deemed the same as if Rubrius had profaned the name of\r\nJupiter; but to the Gods belonged the avenging of injuries done to the\r\nGods.\"\r\n\r\nNot long after, Granius Marcellus, Praetor of Bithynia, was charged with\r\nhigh treason by his own Quaestor, Cepio Crispinus; Romanus Hispo, the\r\npleader, supporting the charge. This Cepio began a course of life which,\r\nthrough the miseries of the times and the bold wickedness of men, became\r\nafterwards famous: at first needy and obscure, but of a busy spirit,\r\nhe made court to the cruelty of the Prince by occult informations; and\r\npresently, as an open accuser, grew terrible to every distinguished\r\nRoman. This procured him credit with one, hatred from all, and made a\r\nprecedent to be followed by others, who from poverty became rich; from\r\nbeing contemned, dreadful; and in the destruction which they brought\r\nupon others, found at last their own. He accused Marcellus of \"malignant\r\nwords concerning Tiberius,\" an inevitable crime! when the accuser,\r\ncollecting all the most detestable parts of the Prince's character,\r\nalleged them as the expressions of the accused; for, because they were\r\ntrue, they were believed to have been spoken. To this, Hispo added,\r\n\"That the statue of Marcellus was by him placed higher than those of the\r\nCaesars; and that, having cut off the head of Augustus, he had in the\r\nroom of it set the head of Tiberius.\" This enraged him so, that breaking\r\nsilence, he cried, \"He would himself, in this cause, give his vote\r\nexplicitly and under the tie of an oath.\" By this he meant to force the\r\nassent of the rest of the Senate. There remained even then some faint\r\ntraces of expiring liberty. Hence Cneius Piso asked him, \"In what place,\r\nCaesar, will you choose to give your opinion? If first, I shall have\r\nyour example to follow; if last, I fear I may ignorantly dissent from\r\nyou.\" The words pierced him, but he bore them, the rather as he was\r\nashamed of his unwary transport; and he suffered the accused to be\r\nacquitted of high treason. To try him for the public money was referred\r\nto the proper judges.\r\n\r\nNor sufficed it Tiberius to assist in the deliberations of the Senate\r\nonly: he likewise sat in the seats of justice; but always on one side,\r\nbecause he would not dispossess the Praetor of his chair; and by his\r\npresence there, many ordinances were established against the intrigues\r\nand solicitations of the Grandees. But while private justice was thus\r\npromoted, public liberty was overthrown. About this time, Pius Aurelius,\r\nthe Senator, whose house, yielding to the pressure of the public road\r\nand aqueducts, had fallen, complained to the Senate and prayed relief:\r\na suit opposed by the Praetors who managed the treasury; but he was\r\nrelieved by Tiberius, who ordered him the price of his house; for he\r\nwas fond of being liberal upon honest occasions: a virtue which he long\r\nretained, even after he had utterly abandoned all other virtues. Upon\r\nPropertius Celer, once Praetor, but now desiring leave to resign the\r\ndignity of Senator, as a burden to his poverty, he bestowed a thousand\r\ngreat sesterces; [Footnote: £8333.] upon ample information, that Celer's\r\nnecessities were derived from his father. Others, who attempted the same\r\nthing, he ordered to lay their condition before the Senate; and from\r\nan affectation of severity was thus austere even where he acted with\r\nuprightness. Hence the rest preferred poverty and silence to begging and\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\nThe same year the Tiber, being swelled with continual rains, overflowed\r\nthe level parts of the city; and the common destruction of men and\r\nhouses followed the returning flood. Hence Asinius Callus moved \"that\r\nthe Sibylline books might be consulted.\" Tiberius opposed it, equally\r\nsmothering all inquiries whatsoever, whether into matters human or\r\ndivine. To Ateius Capito, however, and Lucius Arruntius, was committed\r\nthe care of restraining the river within its banks. The provinces of\r\nAchaia and Macedon, praying relief from their public burdens, were for\r\nthe present discharged of their Proconsular government, and subjected to\r\nthe Emperor's lieutenants. In the entertainment of gladiators at Rome,\r\nDrusus presided: it was exhibited in the name of Germanicus, and his\r\nown; and at it he manifested too much lust of blood, even of the blood\r\nof slaves: a quality terrible to the populace; and hence his father\r\nwas said to have reproved him. His own absence from these shows was\r\nvariously construed: by some it was ascribed to his impatience of a\r\ncrowd; by others to his reserved and solitary genius, and his fear of\r\nan unequal comparison with Augustus, who was wont to be a cheerful\r\nspectator. But, that he thus purposely furnished matter for exposing the\r\ncruelty of his son there, and for raising him popular hate, is what I\r\nwould not believe; though this too was asserted.\r\n\r\nThe dissensions of the theatre, begun last year, broke out now more\r\nviolently, with the slaughter of several, not of the people only, but of\r\nthe soldiers, with that of a Centurion. Nay, a Tribune of a Praetorian\r\ncohort was wounded, whilst they were securing the magistrates from\r\ninsults, and quelling the licentiousness of the rabble. This riot was\r\ncanvassed in the Senate, and votes were passing for empowering the\r\nPraetors to whip the players. Haterius Agrippa, Tribune of the People,\r\nopposed it; and was sharply reprimanded by a speech of Asinius Gallus.\r\nTiberius was silent, and to the Senate allowed these empty apparitions\r\nof liberty. The opposition, however, prevailed, in reverence to the\r\nauthority of Augustus; who, upon a certain occasion, had given his\r\njudgment, \"that players were exempt from stripes:\" nor would Tiberius\r\nassume to violate any words of his. To limit the wages of players, and\r\nrestrain the licentiousness of their partisans, many decrees were made:\r\nthe most remarkable were, \"That no Senator should enter the house of a\r\npantomime; no Roman Knight attend them abroad; they should show nowhere\r\nbut in the theatre; and the Praetors should have power to punish any\r\ninsolence in the spectators with exile.\"\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards were, upon their petition, permitted to build a temple\r\nto Augustus in the colony of Tarragon; an example this for all the\r\nprovinces to follow. In answer to the people, who prayed to be relieved\r\nfrom the _centesima_, a tax of one in the hundred, established at the\r\nend of the civil wars, upon all vendible commodities; Tiberius by an\r\nedict declared, \"That upon this tax depended the fund for maintaining\r\nthe army; nor even thus was the Commonwealth equal to the expense, if\r\nbefore their twentieth year the veterans were dismissed.\" So that\r\nthe concessions made them during the late sedition, to discharge\r\nthem finally at the end of sixteen years, as they were made through\r\nnecessity, were for the future abolished.\r\n\r\nIt was next proposed to the Senate, by Arruntius and Ateius, whether,\r\nin order to restrain the overflowing of the Tiber, the channels of the\r\nseveral rivers and lakes by which it was swelled, must not be diverted.\r\nUpon this question the deputies of several cities and colonies were\r\nheard. The Florentines besought, \"that the bed of the Clanis [Footnote:\r\nChiana.] might not be turned into their river Arnus; [Footnote: Arno.]\r\nfor that the same would prove their utter ruin.\" The like plea was urged\r\nby the Interamnates; [Footnote: Terni.] \"since the most fruitful plains\r\nin Italy would be lost, if, according to the project, the Nar, branched\r\nout into rivulets, overflowed them.\" Nor were the Reatinians less\r\nearnest against stopping the outlets of the Lake Velinus into the Nar;\r\n\"otherwise,\" they said, \"it would break over its banks, and stagnate all\r\nthe adjacent country; the direction of nature was best in all natural\r\nthings: it was she that to rivers had appointed their courses and\r\ndischarges, and set them their limits as well as their sources. Regard\r\ntoo was to be paid to the religion of our Latin allies, who, esteeming\r\nthe rivers of their country sacred, had to them dedicated Priests, and\r\naltars, and groves; nay, the Tiber himself, when bereft of his auxiliary\r\nstreams, would flow with diminished grandeur.\" Now, whether it were\r\nthat the prayers of the colonies, or the difficulty of the work, or the\r\ninfluence of superstition prevailed, it is certain the opinion of Piso\r\nwas followed; namely, that nothing should be altered,\r\n\r\nTo Poppeus Sabinus was continued his province of Mesia; and to it was\r\nadded that of Achaia and Macedon. This too was part of the politics of\r\nTiberius, to prolong governments, and maintain the same men in the same\r\narmies, or civil employments, for the most part, to the end of\r\ntheir lives; with what view, is not agreed. Some think \"that from an\r\nimpatience of returning cares, he was for making whatever he once liked\r\nperpetual.\" Others, \"that from the malignity of his invidious nature, he\r\nregretted the preferring of many.\" There are some who believe, \"that\r\nas he had a crafty penetrating spirit, so he had an understanding ever\r\nirresolute and perplexed.\" So much is certain, that he never courted any\r\neminent virtue, yet hated vice; from the best men he dreaded danger\r\nto himself, and disgrace to the public from the worst. This hesitation\r\nmastered him so much at last that he committed foreign governments to\r\nsome, whom he meant never to suffer to leave Rome.\r\n\r\nConcerning the management of consular elections, either then or\r\nafterwards under Tiberius, I can affirm scarce anything: such is the\r\nvariance about it, not only amongst historians, but even in his own\r\nspeeches. Sometimes, not naming the candidates, he described them by\r\ntheir family, by their life and manners, and by the number of their\r\ncampaigns; so as it might be apparent whom he meant. Again, avoiding\r\neven to describe them, he exhorted the candidates not to disturb the\r\nelection by their intrigues, and promised himself to take care of\r\ntheir interests. But chiefly he used to declare, \"that to him none had\r\nsignified their pretensions, but such whose names he had delivered to\r\nthe Consuls; others too were at liberty to offer the like pretensions,\r\nif they trusted to the favour of the Senate or their own merits.\"\r\nSpecious words! but entirely empty, or full of fraud; and by how\r\nmuch they were covered with the greater guise of liberty, by so much\r\nthreatening a more hasty and devouring bondage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II\r\n\r\nA.D. 16-19.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe commotions in the East happened not ungratefully to Tiberius, since\r\nthen he had a colour for separating Germanicus from his old and faithful\r\nlegions; for setting him over strange provinces, and exposing him at\r\nonce to casual perils and the efforts of fraud. But he, the more ardent\r\nhe found the affections of the soldiers, and the greater the hatred of\r\nhis uncle, so much the more intent upon a decisive victory, weighed\r\nwith himself all the methods of that war, with all the disasters and\r\nsuccesses which had befallen him in it to this his third year. He\r\nremembered \"that the Germans were ever routed in a fair battle, and upon\r\nequal ground; that woods and bogs, short summers, and early winters,\r\nwere their chief resources; that his own men suffered not so much from\r\ntheir wounds, as from tedious marches, and the loss of their arms. The\r\nGauls were weary of furnishing horses; long and cumbersome was his train\r\nof baggage, easily surprised, and with difficulty defended; but, if we\r\nentered the country by sea, the invasion would be easy, and the enemy\r\nunapprised. Besides, the war would be earlier begun; the legions and\r\nprovisions would be carried together; and the cavalry brought with\r\nsafety, through the mouths and channels of the rivers, into the heart of\r\nGermany.\"\r\n\r\nOn that method therefore he fixed: whilst Publius Vitellius and Publius\r\nCantius were sent to collect the tribute of the Gauls; Silius, Anteius,\r\nand Caecina had the direction of building the fleet. A thousand vessels\r\nwere thought sufficient, and with despatch finished: some were short,\r\nsharp at both ends, and wide in the middle, the easier to endure the\r\nagitations of the waves; some had flat bottoms, that without damage\r\nthey might bear to run aground; several had helms at each end, that by\r\nsuddenly turning the oars only they might work either way. Many were\r\narched over, for carrying the engines of war. They were fitted for\r\nholding horses and provisions, to fly with sails, to run with oars, and\r\nthe spirit and alacrity of the soldiers heightened the show and terror\r\nof the fleet. They were to meet at the Isle of Batavia, which was chosen\r\nfor its easy landing, for its convenience to receive the forces, and\r\nthence to transport them to the war. For the Rhine, flowing in one\r\ncontinual channel, or only broken by small islands, is, at the extremity\r\nof Batavia, divided as it were into two rivers; one running still\r\nthrough Germany, and retaining the same name and violent current, till\r\nit mixes with the ocean; the other, washing the Gallic shore, with a\r\nbroader and more gentle stream, is by the inhabitants called by another\r\nname, the Wahal, which it soon after changes for that of the river\r\nMeuse, by whose immense mouth it is discharged into the same ocean.\r\n\r\nWhile the fleet sailed, Germanicus commanded Silius, his lieutenant,\r\nwith a flying band, to invade the Cattans; and he himself, upon hearing\r\nthat the fort upon the river Luppia [Footnote: Lippe.] was besieged, led\r\nsix legions thither: but the sudden rains prevented Silius from doing\r\nmore than taking some small plunder, with the wife and daughter of\r\nArpus, Prince of the Cattans; nor did the besiegers stay to fight\r\nGermanicus, but upon the report of his approach stole off and dispersed.\r\nAs they had, however, thrown down the common tomb lately raised over\r\nthe Varian legions, and the old altar erected to Drusus, he restored the\r\naltar; and performed in person with the legions the funeral ceremony of\r\nrunning courses to the honour of his father. To replace the tomb was\r\nnot thought fit; but all the space between Fort Aliso and the Rhine, he\r\nfortified with a new barrier.\r\n\r\nThe fleet was now arrived, the provisions were sent forward; ships were\r\nassigned to the legions and the allies; and he entered the canal cut\r\nby Drusus, and called by his name. Here he invoked his father \"to be\r\npropitious to his son attempting the same enterprises; to inspire him\r\nwith the same counsels, and animate him by his example.\" Hence he\r\nsailed fortunately through the lakes and the ocean to the river Amisia,\r\n[Footnote: Ems.] and at the town of Amisia the fleet was left upon the\r\nleft shore; and it was a fault that it sailed no higher, for he landed\r\nthe army on the right shore, so that in making bridges many days were\r\nconsumed. The horse and the legions passed over without danger, as it\r\nwas yet ebb; but the returning tide disordered the rear, especially the\r\nBatavians, while they played with the waves, and showed their dexterity\r\nin swimming; and some were drowned. Whilst Germanicus was encamping, he\r\nwas told of the revolt of the Angrivarians behind him, and thither he\r\ndespatched a body of horse and light foot, under Stertinius, who with\r\nfire and slaughter took vengeance on the perfidious revolters.\r\n\r\nBetween the Romans and the Cheruscans flowed the river Visurgis,\r\n[Footnote: Weser.] and on the banks of it stood Arminius, with the other\r\nchiefs: he inquired whether Germanicus was come; and being answered that\r\nhe was there, he prayed leave to speak with his brother. This brother\r\nof his was in the army, his name Flavius; one remarkable for his lasting\r\nfaith towards the Romans, and for the loss of an eye in the war under\r\nTiberius. This request was granted: Flavius stepped forward, and was\r\nsaluted by Arminius, who, having removed his own attendance, desired\r\nthat our archers ranged upon the opposite banks might retire. When\r\nthey were withdrawn, \"How came you,\" says he to his brother, \"by that\r\ndeformity in your face?\" The brother having informed him where, and\r\nin what fight, was next asked, \"what reward he had received?\" Flavius\r\nanswered, \"Increase of pay, the chain, the crown, and other military\r\ngifts;\" all which Arminius treated with derision, as the vile wages of\r\nservitude.\r\n\r\nHere began a warm contest: Flavius pleaded \"the grandeur of the Roman\r\nEmpire, the power of the Emperor, the Roman clemency to submitting\r\nnations, the heavy yoke of the vanquished; and that neither the wife nor\r\nson of Arminius was used like a captive.\" Arminius to all this opposed\r\n\"the natural rights of their country, their ancient liberty, the\r\ndomestic Gods of Germany; he urged the prayers of their common mother\r\njoined to his own, that he would not prefer the character of a deserter,\r\nthat of a betrayer of his family, his countrymen, and kindred, to the\r\nglory of being their commander.\" By degrees they fell into reproaches;\r\nnor would the interposition of the river have restrained them from\r\nblows, had not Stertinius hasted to lay hold on Flavius, full of rage,\r\nand calling for his arms and his horse. On the opposite side was seen\r\nArminius, swelling with ferocity and threats, and denouncing battle.\r\nFor, of what he said, much was said in Latin, having as the General of\r\nhis countrymen served in the Roman armies.\r\n\r\nNext day, the German army stood embattled beyond the Visurgis.\r\nGermanicus, who thought it became not a General to endanger the legions,\r\ntill for their passage and security he had placed bridges and guards,\r\nmade the horse ford over. They were led by Stertinius, and Aemilius,\r\nLieutenant-Colonel of a legion; and these two officers crossed the\r\nriver in distant places, to divide the foe. Cariovalda, Captain of the\r\nBatavians, passed it where most rapid, and was by the Cheruscans, who\r\nfeigned flight, drawn into a plain surrounded with woods, whence they\r\nrushed out upon him and assaulted him on every side; overthrew those who\r\nresisted, and pressed vehemently upon those who gave way. The distressed\r\nBatavians formed themselves into a ring, but were again broken, partly\r\nby a close assault, partly by distant showers of darts. Cariovalda,\r\nhaving long sustained the fury of the enemy, exhorted his men to draw up\r\ninto platoons, and break through the prevailing host; he himself forced\r\nhis way into their centre, and fell with his horse under a shower of\r\ndarts, and many of the principal Batavians round him; the rest were\r\nsaved by their own bravery, or rescued by the cavalry under Stertinius\r\nand Aemilius.\r\n\r\nGermanicus, having passed the Visurgis, learned from a deserter, that\r\nArminius had marked out the place of battle; that more nations had also\r\njoined him; that they rendezvoused in a wood sacred to Hercules, and\r\nwould attempt to storm our camp by night. The deserter was believed;\r\nthe enemy's fires were discerned; and the scouts having advanced towards\r\nthem, reported that they had heard the neighing of horses, and the\r\nhollow murmur of a mighty and tumultuous host. In this important\r\nconjuncture, upon the approach of a decisive battle, Germanicus thought\r\nit behoved him to learn the inclinations and spirit of the soldiers\r\nand deliberated with himself how to be informed without fraud: \"for the\r\nreports of the Tribunes and Centurions used to be oftener pleasing than\r\ntrue; his Freedmen had still slavish souls, incapable of free speech;\r\nfriends were apt to flatter; there was the same uncertainty in an\r\nassemble, where the counsel proposed by a few was wont to be echoed by\r\nall; in truth, the minds of the soldiery were then best known, when\r\nthey were least watched; when free and over their meals, they frankly\r\ndisclosed their hopes and fears.\"\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of night, he went out at the augural gate, with a\r\nsingle attendant; himself disguised with the skin of a wild beast\r\nhanging over his shoulders; and choosing secret ways, he escaped the\r\nnotice of the watch, entered the lanes of the camp, listened from tent\r\nto tent, and enjoyed the pleasing display of his own popularity and\r\nfame; as one was magnifying the imperial birth of his general; another,\r\nhis graceful person; and all, his patience, condescension, and the\r\nequality of his soul in every temper, pleasant or grave: they confessed\r\nthe gratitude due to so much merit, and that in battle they ought to\r\nexpress it, and to sacrifice at the same time to glory and revenge these\r\nperfidious Germans, who for ever violated stipulations and peace. In the\r\nmeantime one of the enemy who understood Latin rode up to the palisades,\r\nand with a loud voice offered, in the name of Arminius, to every\r\ndeserter a wife and land, and as long as the war lasted an hundred\r\nsesterces a day. [Footnote: 16s. 8d.] This contumely kindled the wrath\r\nof the legions: \"Let day come,\" they cried, \"let battle be given: the\r\nsoldiers would seize and not accept the lands of the Germans; take and\r\nnot receive German wives; they, however, received the offer as an omen\r\nof victory, and considered the money and women as their destined prey.\"\r\nNear the third watch of the night, they approached and insulted the\r\ncamp; but without striking a blow, when they found the ramparts covered\r\nthick with cohorts, and no advantage given.\r\n\r\nGermanicus had the same night a joyful dream: he thought he sacrificed,\r\nand, in place of his own robe besmeared with the sacred blood, received\r\none fairer from the hands of his grandmother Augusta; so that elevated\r\nby the omen, and by equal encouragement from the auspices, he called an\r\nassembly, where he opened his deliberations concerning the approaching\r\nbattle with all the advantages contributing to victory: \"That to the\r\nRoman soldiers not only plains and dales, but, with due circumspection,\r\neven woods and forests were commodious for an engagement. The huge\r\ntargets, the enormous spears, of the Barbarians could never be wielded\r\namongst thickets and trunks of trees like Roman swords and javelins,\r\nand armour adjusted to the shape and size of their bodies, so that with\r\nthese tractable arms they might thicken their blows, and strike with\r\ncertainty at the naked faces of the enemy, since the Germans were\r\nneither furnished with headpiece nor coat of mail, nor were their\r\nbucklers bound with leather or fortified with iron, but all bare\r\nbasket-work or painted boards; and though their first ranks were armed\r\nwith pikes, the rest had only stakes burnt at the end, or short and\r\ncontemptible darts; for their persons, as they were terrible to sight\r\nand violent in the onset, so they were utterly impatient of wounds,\r\nunaffected with their own disgrace, unconcerned for the honour of their\r\ngeneral, whom they ever deserted and fled; in distress cowards, in\r\nprosperity despisers of all divine, of all human laws. In fine, if the\r\narmy, after their fatigues at sea and their tedious marches by land,\r\nlonged for an utter end of their labour, by this battle they might gain\r\nit. The Elbe was now nearer than the Rhine; and if they would make him\r\na conqueror in those countries where his father and his uncle had\r\nconquered, the war was concluded.\" The ardour of the soldiers followed\r\nthe speech of the general, and the signal for the onset was given.\r\n\r\nNeither did Arminius or the other chiefs neglect to declare to their\r\nseveral bands that \"these Romans were the cowardly fugitives of the\r\nVarian army, who, because they could not endure to fight, had afterwards\r\nchosen to rebel. That some with backs deformed by wounds, some with\r\nlimbs maimed by tempests, forsaken of hope, and the Gods against them,\r\nwere once more presenting their lives to their vengeful foes. Hitherto a\r\nfleet, and unfrequented seas, had been the resources of their cowardice\r\nagainst an assaulting or a pursuing enemy; but now that they were to\r\nengage hand to hand, vain would be their relief from wind and oars after\r\na defeat. The Germans needed only remember their rapine, cruelty, and\r\npride; and that to themselves nothing remained but either to maintain\r\ntheir native liberty, or by death to prevent bondage.\"\r\n\r\nThe enemy, thus inflamed and calling for battle, were led into a\r\nplain called Idistavisus: [Footnote: Near Minden.] it lies between the\r\nVisurgis and the hills, and winds unequally along, as it is straitened\r\nby the swellings of the mountains or enlarged by the circuits of the\r\nriver. Behind rose a forest of high trees, thick of branches above but\r\nclear of bushes below. The army of Barbarians kept the plain, and\r\nthe entrances of the forest. The Cheruscans alone sat down upon the\r\nmountain, in order to pour down from thence upon the Romans as soon as\r\nthey became engaged in the fight. Our army marched thus: the auxiliary\r\nGauls and Germans in front, after them the foot archers, next four\r\nlegions, and then Germanicus with two Praetorian cohorts and the choice\r\nof the cavalry; then four legions more, and the light foot with archers\r\non horseback and the other troops of the allies; the men all intent to\r\nmarch in order of battle and ready to engage as they marched.\r\n\r\nAs the impatient bands of Cheruscans were now perceived descending\r\nfiercely from the hills, Germanicus commanded a body of the best horse\r\nto charge them in the flank, and Stertinius with the rest to wheel round\r\nto attack them in the rear, and promised to be ready to assist them in\r\nperson. During this a joyful omen appeared: eight eagles were seen\r\nto fly toward the wood, and to enter it; a presage of victory to the\r\nGeneral. \"_Advance_,\" he cried, \"_follow the Roman birds; follow the\r\ntutelar Deities of the legions!_\" Instantly the foot charged the enemy's\r\nfront, and instantly the detached cavalry attacked their flank and rear:\r\nthis double assault had a strange event; the two divisions of their\r\narmy fled opposite ways; that in the woods ran to the plain; that in the\r\nplain rushed into the woods. The Cheruscans, between both, were driven\r\nfrom the hills; amongst them Arminius, remarkably brave, who with his\r\nhand, his voice, and distinguished wounds was still sustaining the\r\nfight. He had assaulted the archers, and would have broken through them,\r\nbut the cohorts of the Retians, the Vindelicians, and the Gauls marched\r\nto their relief; however, by his own vigour and the force of his horse,\r\nhe escaped, his face besmeared with his own blood to avoid being\r\nknown. Some have related that the Chaucians, who were amongst the\r\nRoman auxiliaries, knew him, and let him go; the same bravery or deceit\r\nprocured Inguiomerus his escape; the rest were everywhere slain; and\r\ngreat numbers attempting to swim the Visurgis were destroyed in it,\r\neither pursued with darts, or swallowed by the current, or overwhelmed\r\nwith the weight of the crowd, or buried under the falling banks; some\r\nseeking a base refuge on the tops of trees, and concealment amongst the\r\nbranches, were shot in sport by the archers, or squashed as the trees\r\nwere felled: a mighty victory this, and to us far from bloody!\r\n\r\nThis slaughter of the foe, from the fifth hour of the day till night,\r\nfilled the country for ten miles with carcasses and arms: amongst the\r\nspoils, chains were found, which, sure of conquering, they had brought\r\nto bind the Roman captives. The soldiers proclaimed Tiberius _Imperator_\r\nupon the field of battle, and raising a mount, placed upon it as\r\ntrophies the German arms, with the names of all the vanquished nations\r\ninscribed below.\r\n\r\nThis sight filled the Germans with more anguish and rage than all their\r\nwounds, past afflictions, and slaughters. They, who were just prepared\r\nto abandon their dwellings, and flit beyond the Elbe, meditate war and\r\ngrasp their arms: people, nobles, youth, aged, all rush suddenly upon\r\nthe Roman army in its march and disorder it. They next chose their\r\ncamp, a strait and moist plain shut in between a river and a forest, the\r\nforest too surrounded with a deep marsh, except on one side, which was\r\nclosed with a barrier raised by the Angrivarians between them and the\r\nCheruscans. Here stood their foot; their horse were distributed and\r\nconcealed amongst the neighbouring groves, thence, by surprise, to beset\r\nthe legions in the rear as soon as they had entered the wood.\r\n\r\nNothing of all this was a secret to Germanicus: he knew their counsels,\r\ntheir stations, what steps they pursued, what measures they concealed;\r\nand, to the destruction of the enemy, turned their own subtilty and\r\ndevices. To Seius Tubero, his Lieutenant, he committed the horse and\r\nthe field; the infantry so disposed, that part might pass the level\r\napproaches into the wood, and the rest force the ramparts; this was the\r\nmost arduous task, and to himself he reserved it; the rest he left to\r\nhis Lieutenants. Those who had the even ground to traverse, broke easily\r\nin; but they who were to assail the rampart, were as grievously battered\r\nfrom above, as if they had been storming a wall. The General perceived\r\nthe inequality of this close attack, and drawing off the legions a small\r\ndistance, ordered the slingers to throw, and the engineers to play, to\r\nbeat off the enemy: immediately showers of darts were poured from the\r\nengines, and the defenders of the barrier, the more bold and exposed\r\nthey were, with the more wounds they were beaten down. Germanicus,\r\nhaving taken the rampart, first forced his way, at the head of the\r\nPraetorian cohorts, into the woods, and there it was fought foot to\r\nfoot; behind, the enemy were begirt with the morass, the Romans with the\r\nmountains or the rivers; no room for either to retreat, no hope but in\r\nvalour, no safety but in victory.\r\n\r\nThe Germans had no inferior courage, but they were exceeded in the\r\nfashion of arms and art of fighting. Their mighty multitude, hampered\r\nin narrow places, could not push nor recover their long spears, nor\r\npractise in a close combat their usual boundings and velocity of limbs.\r\nOn the contrary, our soldiers, with handy swords, and their breasts\r\nclosely guarded with a buckler, delved the large bodies and naked faces\r\nof the Barbarians, and opened themselves a way with a havoc of the\r\nenemy: besides, the activity of Arminius now failed him, either spent\r\nthrough his continual efforts or slackened by a wound just received.\r\nInguiomerus was everywhere upon the spur, animating the battle, but\r\nfortune rather than courage deserted him. Germanicus, to be the easier\r\nknown, pulled off his helmet, and exhorted his men \"to prosecute the\r\nslaughter; they wanted no captives,\" he said; \"only the cutting off that\r\npeople root and branch would put an end to the war.\" It was now late\r\nin the day, and he drew off a legion to make a camp; the rest glutted\r\nthemselves till night, with the blood of the foe; the horse fought with\r\ndoubtful success.\r\n\r\nGermanicus, in a speech from the tribunal, praised his victorious army,\r\nand raised a monument of arms with a proud inscription: \"That the army\r\nof Tiberius Caesar, having vanquished entirely the nations between the\r\nRhine and the Elbe, had consecrated that monument to Mars, to Jupiter,\r\nand to Augustus.\" Of himself, he made no mention, either fearful of\r\nprovoking envy, or that he thought it sufficient praise to have deserved\r\nit. He had next commanded Stertinius to carry the war amongst the\r\nAngrivarians; but they instantly submitted; and these supplicants, by\r\nyielding without articles, obtained pardon without reserve.\r\n\r\nThe summer now declining, some of the legions were sent back into winter\r\nquarters by land; more were embarked with Germanicus upon the river\r\nAmisia, to go from thence by the ocean. The sea at first was serene, no\r\nsound or agitation but from the oars or sails of a thousand ships; but\r\nsuddenly a black host of clouds poured a storm of hail; furious winds\r\nroared on every side, and the tempest darkened the deep, so that all\r\nprospect was lost; and it was impossible to steer. The soldiers too,\r\nunaccustomed to the terrors of the sea, in the hurry of fear disordered\r\nthe mariners, or interrupted the skilful by unskilful help. At last the\r\nsouth wind, mastering all the rest, drove the ocean and the sky: the\r\ntempest derived new force from the windy mountains and swelling rivers\r\nof Germany, as well as from an immense train of clouds; and contracting\r\nwithal fresh vigour from the boisterous neighbourhood of the north, it\r\nhurled the ships and tossed them into the open ocean, or against islands\r\nshored with rocks or dangerously beset with covered shoals. The ships\r\nby degrees, with great labour and the change of the tide, were relieved\r\nfrom the rocks and sands, but remained at the mercy of the winds; their\r\nanchors could not hold them; they were full of water, nor could all\r\ntheir pumps discharge it: hence, to lighten and raise the vessels\r\nswallowing at their decks the invading waves, the horses, beasts,\r\nbaggage, and even the arms were cast into the deep.\r\n\r\nBy how much the German ocean is more outrageous than the rest of the\r\nsea, and the German climate excels in rigour, by so much this ruin was\r\nreckoned to exceed in greatness and novelty. They were engaged in a\r\ntempestuous sea, believed deep without bottom, vast without bounds, or\r\nno shores near but hostile shores: part of the fleet were swallowed up;\r\nmany were driven upon remote islands void of human culture, where the\r\nmen perished through famine, or were kept alive by the carcasses of\r\nhorses cast in by the flood. Only the galley of Germanicus landed upon\r\nthe coast of the Chaucians, where wandering sadly, day and night, upon\r\nthe rocks and prominent shore, and incessantly accusing himself as\r\nthe author of such mighty destruction, he was hardly restrained by his\r\nfriends from casting himself desperately into the same hostile floods.\r\nAt last, with the returning tide and an assisting gale, the ships began\r\nto return, all maimed, almost destitute of oars, or with coats spread\r\nfor sails; and some, utterly disabled, were dragged by those that\r\nwere less. He repaired them hastily, and despatched them to search the\r\nislands; and by this care many men were gleaned up; many were by the\r\nAngrivarians, our new subjects, redeemed from their maritime neighbours\r\nand restored; and some, driven into Great Britain, were sent back by the\r\nlittle British kings. Those who had come from afar, recounted wonders\r\nat their return, \"the impetuosity of whirlwinds; wonderful birds; sea\r\nmonsters of ambiguous forms, between man and beasts.\" Strange sights\r\nthese! or the effects of imagination and fear.\r\n\r\nThe noise of this wreck, as it animated the Germans with hopes of\r\nrenewing the war, awakened Germanicus also to restrain them: he\r\ncommanded Caius Silius, with thirty thousand foot and three thousand\r\nhorse, to march against the Cattans: he himself, with a greater force,\r\ninvaded the Marsians, where he learnt from Malovendus, their general,\r\nlately taken into our subjection, that the Eagle of one of Varus's\r\nlegions was hid underground in a neighbouring grove, and kept by a\r\nslender guard. Instantly two parties were despatched; one to face the\r\nenemy and provoke them from their post; the other to beset their rear\r\nand dig up the Eagle; and success attended both. Hence Germanicus\r\nadvanced with great alacrity, laid waste the country, and smote the\r\nfoe, either not daring to engage, or, wherever they engaged, suddenly\r\ndefeated. Nor, as we learnt from the prisoners, were they ever seized\r\nwith greater dismay: \"The Romans,\" they cried, \"are invincible: no\r\ncalamities can subdue them: they have wrecked their fleet; their arms\r\nare lost; our shores are covered with the bodies of their horses and\r\nmen; and yet they attack us with their usual ferocity, with the same\r\nfirmness, and with numbers as it were increased.\"\r\n\r\nThe army was from thence led back into winter quarters, full of joy to\r\nhave balanced, by this prosperous expedition, their late misfortune at\r\nsea; and by the bounty of Germanicus, their joy was heightened, since to\r\neach sufferer he caused to be paid as much as each declared he had\r\nlost; neither was it doubted but the enemy were humbled, and concerting\r\nmeasures for obtaining peace, and that the next summer would terminate\r\nthe war. But Tiberius by frequent letters urged him \"to come home, there\r\nto celebrate the triumph already decreed him; urged that he had already\r\ntried enough of events, and tempted abundant hazards: he had indeed\r\nfought great and successful battles; but he must likewise remember his\r\nlosses and calamities, which, however, owing to wind and waves, and no\r\nfault of the general, were yet great and grievous. He himself had been\r\nsent nine times into Germany by Augustus, and effected much more by\r\npolicy than arms: it was thus he had brought the Sigambrians into\r\nsubjection, thus drawn the Suevians and King Maroboduus under the bonds\r\nof peace. The Cheruscans too, and the other hostile nations, now the\r\nRoman vengeance was satiated, might be left to pursue their own national\r\nfeuds.\" Germanicus besought one year to accomplish his conquest; but\r\nTiberius assailed his modesty with a new bait and fresh opportunity, by\r\noffering him another Consulship, for the administration of which he was\r\nto attend in person at Rome. He added, \"that if the war was still to\r\nbe prosecuted, Germanicus should leave a field of glory to his brother\r\nDrusus, to whom there now remained no other; since the Empire had\r\nnowhere a war to maintain but in Germany, and thence only Drusus\r\ncould acquire the title of Imperator, and merit the triumphal laurel.\"\r\nGermanicus persisted no longer; though he knew that this was all feigned\r\nand hollow, and saw himself invidiously torn away from a harvest of ripe\r\nglory.\r\n\r\nDecrees of the Senate were made for driving astrologers and magicians\r\nout of Italy; and one of the herd, Lucius Pituanius, was precipitated\r\nfrom the Tarpeian Rock: Publius Marcius, another, was, by the judgment\r\nof the Consuls, at the sound of trumpet executed without the Esquiline\r\nGate, according to the ancient form.\r\n\r\nNext time the Senate sat, long discourses against the luxury of the\r\ncity were made by Quintus Haterius, a consular, and by Octavius Fronto,\r\nformerly Praetor; and a law was passed \"against using table-plate\r\nof solid gold, and against men debasing themselves with gorgeous and\r\neffeminate silks.\" Fronto went further, and desired that \"the quantities\r\nof silver plate, the expense of furniture, and the number of domestics\r\nmight be limited;\" for it was yet common for senators to depart from\r\nthe present debate and offer, as their advice, whatever they judged\r\nconducing to the interest of the commonweal. Against him it was argued\r\nby Asinius Callus, \"That with the growth of the Empire private riches\r\nwere likewise grown, and it was no new thing for citizens to live\r\naccording to their conditions, but agreeable to the most primitive\r\nusage: the ancient Fabricii and the later Scipios, having different\r\nwealth, lived differently; but all suitably to the several stages of the\r\nCommonwealth. Public property was accompanied with domestic; but when\r\nthe State rose to such a height of magnificence, the magnificence of\r\nparticulars rose too. As to plate, and train, and expense, there was no\r\nstandard of excess or frugality, but from the fortunes of men. The law,\r\nindeed, had made a distinction between the fortunes of senators and\r\nknights; not for any natural difference between them, but that they\r\nwho excelled in place, rank, and civil pre-eminence, might excel too in\r\nother particulars, such as conduced to the health of the body or to the\r\npeace and solacement of the soul; unless it were expected, that the most\r\nillustrious citizens should sustain the sharpest cares, and undergo\r\nthe heaviest fatigues and dangers, but continue destitute of every\r\nalleviation of fatigue and danger and care.\" Gallus easily prevailed,\r\nwhilst under worthy names he avowed and supported popular vices in an\r\nassembly engaged in them. Tiberius too had said, \"That it was not a\r\nseason for reformation; or, if there were any corruption of manners,\r\nthere would not be wanting one to correct them.\"\r\n\r\nDuring these transactions, Lucius Piso, after he had declaimed bitterly\r\nin the Senate against \"the ambitious practices and intrigues of the\r\nForum, the corruption of the tribunals, and the inhumanity of the\r\npleaders breathing continual terror and impeachments,\" declared \"he\r\nwould entirely relinquish Rome, and retire into a quiet corner of the\r\ncountry, far distant and obscure.\" With these words he left the Senate;\r\nTiberius was provoked; and yet not only soothed him with gentle words,\r\nbut likewise obliged Piso's relations, by their authority or entreaties,\r\nto retain him. The same Piso gave soon after an equal instance of the\r\nindignation of the free spirit, by prosecuting a suit against Urgulania;\r\na lady whom the partial friendship of Livia had set at defiance with the\r\nlaws. Urgulania being carried, for protection, to the palace, despised\r\nthe efforts of Piso; so that neither did she submit; nor would he\r\ndesist, notwithstanding the complaints and resentments of Livia, that\r\nin the prosecution \"violence and indignity were done to her own person.\"\r\nTiberius promised to attend the trial, and assist Urgulania; but only\r\npromised in civility to his mother, for so far he thought it became him;\r\nand thus left the palace, ordering his guards to follow at a distance.\r\nPeople the while crowded about him, and he walked with a slow and\r\ncomposed air: as he lingered, and prolonged the time and way with\r\nvarious discourse, the trial went on. Piso would not be mollified by the\r\nimportunity of his friends; and hence at last the Empress ordered the\r\npayment of the money claimed by him. This was the issue of the affair:\r\nby it, Piso lost no renown; and it signally increased the credit of\r\nTiberius. The power, however, of Urgulania was so exorbitant to the\r\nState, that she disdained to appear a witness in a certain cause before\r\nthe Senate: and, when it had been always usual even for the Vestal\r\nVirgins to attend the Forum and Courts of Justice, as oft as their\r\nevidence was required; a Praetor was sent to examine Urgulania at her\r\nown house.\r\n\r\nThe procrastination which happened this year in the public affairs, I\r\nshould not mention, but that the different opinions of Cneius Piso and\r\nAsinius Gallus about it, are worth knowing. Their dispute was occasioned\r\nby a declaration of Tiberius; \"that he was about to be absent,\" and it\r\nwas the motion of Piso, \"that for that very reason, the prosecution\r\nof public business was the rather to be continued; since, as in the\r\nPrince's absence, the Senate and equestrian order might administer\r\ntheir several parts, the same would redound to the honour of the\r\nCommonwealth.\" This was a declaration for liberty, and in it Piso had\r\nprevented Gallus, who now in opposition said, \"that nothing sufficiently\r\nillustrious, nor suiting the dignity of the Roman People, could be\r\ntransacted but under the immediate eye of the Emperor, and therefore the\r\nconflux of suitors and affairs from Italy and the provinces must by\r\nall means be reserved for his presence.\" Tiberius heard and was silent,\r\nwhile the debate was managed on both sides with mighty vehemence; but\r\nthe adjournment was carried.\r\n\r\nA debate too arose between Gallus and the Emperor: for Gallus moved\r\n\"that the magistrates should be henceforth elected but once every five\r\nyears; that the legates of the legions, who had never exercised the\r\nPraetorships, should be appointed Praetors; and that the Prince should\r\nnominate twelve candidates every year.\" It was not doubted but this\r\nmotion had a deeper aim, and that by it the secret springs and\r\nreserves of imperial power were invaded. But Tiberius, as if he rather\r\napprehended the augmentation of his power, argued \"that it was a heavy\r\ntask upon his moderation, to choose so many magistrates, and to postpone\r\nso many candidates. That disgusts from disappointments were hardly\r\navoided in yearly elections; though, for their solacement, fresh hopes\r\nremained of approaching success in the next; now how great must be the\r\nhatred, how lasting the resentment of such whose pretensions were to be\r\nrejected beyond five years? and whence could it be foreseen that, in\r\nso long a tract of time, the same men would continue to have the\r\nsame dispositions, the same alliances and fortunes? even an annual\r\ndesignation to power made men imperious; how imperious would it make\r\nthem, if they bore the honour for five years! besides, it would multiply\r\nevery single magistrate into five, and utterly subvert the laws which\r\nhad prescribed a proper space for exercising the diligence of the\r\ncandidates, and for soliciting as well as enjoying preferments.\"\r\n\r\nBy this speech, in appearance popular, he still retained the spirit\r\nand force of the sovereignty. He likewise sustained by gratuities, the\r\ndignity of some necessitous Senators: hence it was the more wondered,\r\nthat he received with haughtiness and repulse the petition of Marcus\r\nHortalus, a young man of signal quality and manifestly poor. He was\r\nthe grandson of Hortensius the Orator; and had been encouraged by\r\nthe deified Augustus, with a bounty of a thousand great sestertia,\r\n[Footnote: £8333.] to marry for posterity; purely to prevent the\r\nextinction of a family most illustrious and renowned. The Senate were\r\nsitting in the palace, and Hortalus having set his four children before\r\nthe door, fixed his eyes, now upon the statue of Hortensius, placed\r\namongst the orators; then upon that of Augustus; and instead of speaking\r\nto the question, began on this wise: \"Conscript Fathers, you see there\r\nthe number and infancy of my children; not mine by my own choice, but in\r\ncompliance with the advice of the Prince: such too was the splendour of\r\nmy ancestors, that it merited to be perpetuated in their race; but for\r\nmy own particular, who, marred by the revolution of the times, could not\r\nraise wealth, nor engage popular favour, nor cultivate the hereditary\r\nfortune of our house, the fortune of Eloquence: I deemed it sufficient\r\nif, in my slender circumstances, I lived no disgrace to myself, no\r\nburden to others. Commanded by the Emperor, I took a wife; behold\r\nthe offspring of so many Consuls; behold the descendants of so many\r\nDictators! nor is this remembrance invidiously made, but made to move\r\nmercy. In the progress of your reign, Caesar, these children may arrive\r\nat the honours in your gift; defend them in the meantime from want:\r\nthey are the great-grandsons of Hortensius; they are the foster sons of\r\nAugustus.\"\r\n\r\nThe inclination of the Senate was favourable; an incitement this to\r\nTiberius the more eagerly to thwart Hortalus. These were in effect his\r\nwords: \"If all that are poor recur hither for a provision of money to\r\ntheir children, the public will certainly fail, and yet particulars\r\nnever be satiated. Our ancestors, when they permitted a departure from\r\nthe question, to propose somewhat more important to the State, did not\r\ntherefore permit it, that we might here transact domestic matters, and\r\naugment our private rents: an employment invidious both in the Senate\r\nand the Prince; since, whether they grant or deny the petitioned\r\nbounties, either the people or the petitioners will ever be offended.\r\nBut these, in truth, are not petitions; they are demands made against\r\norder, and made by surprise: while you are assembled upon other affairs,\r\nhe stands up and urges your pity, by the number and infancy of his\r\nchildren; with the same violence, he charges the attack to me, and as\r\nit were bursts open the exchequer; but if by popular bounties we exhaust\r\nit, by rapine and oppression we must supply it. The deified Augustus\r\ngave you money, Hortalus; but without solicitation he gave it, and on\r\nno condition that it should always be given: otherwise diligence will\r\nlanguish; sloth will prevail; and men having no hopes in resources\r\nof their own, no anxiety for themselves, but all securely relying on\r\nforeign relief, will become private sluggards and public burdens.\" These\r\nand the like reasonings of Tiberius were differently received; with\r\napprobation by those whose way it is to extol, without distinction,\r\nall the doings of Princes, worthy and unworthy; by most, however, with\r\nsilence, or low and discontented murmurs. Tiberius perceived it, and\r\nhaving paused a little, said \"his answer was particularly to Hortalus;\r\nbut if the Senate thought fit, he would give his sons two hundred great\r\nsestertia each.\" [Footnote: £1666.] For this all the Senators presented\r\ntheir thanks; only Hortalus said nothing; perhaps through present awe,\r\nor perhaps possessed, even in poverty, with the grandeur of his ancient\r\nnobility. Nor did Tiberius ever show further pity, though the house of\r\nHortensius was fallen into shameful distress.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the year, a triumphal arch was raised near the Temple of\r\nSaturn; a monument this for the recovery of the Varian Eagles, under\r\nthe conduct of Germanicus, under the auspices of Tiberius. A temple was\r\ndedicated to Happy Fortune near the Tiber, in the gardens bequeathed to\r\nthe Roman People by Caesar, the Dictator. A chapel was consecrated to\r\nthe Julian family, and statues to the deified Augustus, in the suburbs\r\ncalled Bovillae. In the consulship of Caius Celius and Lucius Pomponius,\r\nthe six-and-twentieth of May, Germanicus Caesar triumphed over the\r\nCheruscans, the Cattans, the Angrivarians, and the other nations as far\r\nas the Elbe. In the triumph were carried all the spoils and captives,\r\nwith the representations of mountains, of rivers, and of battles; so\r\nthat his conquests, because he was restrained from completing them, were\r\ntaken for complete. His own graceful person, and his chariot filled with\r\nhis five children, heightened the show and the delight of the beholders;\r\nyet they were checked with secret fears, as they remembered \"that\r\npopular favour had proved malignant to his father Drusus; that his uncle\r\nMarcellus was snatched, in his youth, from the burning affections of the\r\npopulace; and that ever short-lived and unfortunate were the favourites\r\nof the Roman People.\"\r\n\r\nTiberius distributed to the people, in the name of Germanicus, three\r\nhundred sesterces a man, [Footnote: £2, 10s.] and named himself his\r\ncolleague in the Consulship. Nor even thus did he gain the opinion of\r\ntenderness and sincerity: in effect, on pretence of investing the young\r\nPrince with fresh preferment and honours, he resolved to alienate\r\nhim from Rome; and, to accomplish it, craftily framed an occasion, or\r\nsnatched such an one as chance presented. Archelaus had enjoyed\r\nthe kingdom of Cappadocia now fifty years; a Prince under the deep\r\ndispleasure of Tiberius, because, in his retirement at Rhodes, the King\r\nhad paid him no sort of court or distinction: an omission this which\r\nproceeded from no disdain, but from the warnings given him by the\r\nconfidents of Augustus; for that the young Caius Caesar, the presumptive\r\nheir to the sovereignty, then lived, and was sent to compose and\r\nadminister the affairs of the East; hence the friendship of Tiberius was\r\nreckoned then dangerous. But when, by the utter fall of the family of\r\nthe Caesars, he had gained the Empire, he enticed Archelaus to Rome,\r\nby means of letters from his mother, who, without dissembling her son's\r\nresentment, offered the King his mercy, provided he came and in person\r\nimplored it. He, who was either ignorant of the snare, or dreaded\r\nviolence if he appeared to perceive it, hastened to the city, where he\r\nwas received by Tiberius with great sternness and wrath, and soon after\r\naccused as a criminal in the Senate. The crimes alleged against him were\r\nmere fictions; yet, as equal treatment is unusual to kings, and to be\r\ntreated like malefactors intolerable; Archelaus, who was broken with\r\ngrief as well as age, by choice or fate ended his life; his kingdom was\r\nreduced into a province, and by its revenues Tiberius declared the tax\r\nof a hundredth penny would be abated, and reduced it for the future to\r\nthe two hundredth. At the same time died Antiochus, king of Comagena,\r\nas also Philopator, king of Cilicia; and great combustions shook these\r\nnations; whilst of the people many desired Roman government, and many\r\nwere addicted to domestic monarchy. The provinces, too, of Syria and\r\nJudea, as they were oppressed with impositions, prayed an abatement of\r\ntribute.\r\n\r\nThese affairs, and such as I have above related concerning Armenia,\r\nTiberius represented to the Fathers, and \"that the commotions of the\r\nEast could only be settled by the wisdom and abilities of Germanicus;\r\nfor himself, his age now declined, and that of Drusus was not yet\r\nsufficiently ripe.\" The provinces beyond the sea were thence decreed to\r\nGermanicus, with authority superior to all those who obtained provinces\r\nby lot, or the nomination of the Prince; but Tiberius had already taken\r\ncare to remove from the government of Syria Creticus Silanus, one united\r\nto Germanicus in domestic alliance, by having to Nero, the eldest son of\r\nGermanicus, betrothed his daughter. In his room he had preferred Cneius\r\nPiso, a man of violent temper, incapable of subjection, and heir to all\r\nthe ferocity and haughtiness of his father Piso; the same who, in the\r\ncivil war, assisted the reviving party against Caesar in Africa with\r\nvehement efforts; and then followed Brutus and Cassius, but had at last\r\nleave to come home, yet disdained to sue for any public offices; nay,\r\nwas even courted by Augustus to accept the Consulship. His son, besides\r\nhis hereditary pride and impetuosity, was elevated with the nobility and\r\nwealth of Plancina his wife; scarce yielded he to Tiberius, and, as men\r\nfar beneath him, despised the sons of Tiberius; neither did he doubt but\r\nhe was set over Syria on purpose to thwart the measures and defeat all\r\nthe views of Germanicus. Some even believed that he had to this purpose\r\nsecret orders from Tiberius, as it was certain that Livia directed\r\nPlancina to exert the spirit of the sex, and by constant emulation and\r\nindignities persecute Agrippina. For the whole court was rent, and their\r\naffections secretly divided between Drusus and Germanicus. Tiberius\r\nwas partial to Drusus, as his own son by generation; others loved\r\nGermanicus; the more for the aversion of his uncle, and for being by his\r\nmother of more illustrious descent; as Marc Anthony was his grandfather,\r\nand Augustus his great-uncle. On the other side, Pomponius Atticus, a\r\nRoman knight, by being the great-grandfather of Drusus, seemed thence\r\nto have derived a stain upon the images of the Claudian house; besides,\r\nAgrippina, the wife of Germanicus, did in the fruitfulness of her body\r\nand the reputation of her virtue far excel Livia, the wife of Drusus.\r\nYet the two brothers lived in amiable dearness and concord, no wise\r\nshaken or estranged by the reigning contention amongst their separate\r\nfriends and adherents.\r\n\r\nDrusus was soon after sent into Illyricum in order to inure him to war,\r\nand gain him the affections of the army; besides, Tiberius thought\r\nthat the youth, who loved wantoning in the luxuries of Rome, would be\r\nreformed in the camp, and that his own security would be enlarged when\r\nboth his sons were at the head of the legions. But the pretence of\r\nsending him was the protection of the Suevians, who were then imploring\r\nassistance against the powers of the Cheruscans. For these nations, who\r\nsince the departure of the Romans saw themselves no longer threatened\r\nwith terrors from abroad, and were then particularly engaged in a\r\nnational competition for glory, had relapsed, as usual, into their old\r\nintestine feuds, and turned their arms upon each other. The two\r\npeople were equally powerful, and their two leaders equally brave; but\r\ndifferently esteemed, as the title of king upon Maroboduus had drawn\r\nthe hate and aversion of his countrymen; whilst Arminius, as a champion\r\nwarring for the defence of liberty, was the universal object of popular\r\naffection.\r\n\r\nHence not only the Cheruscans and their confederates, they who had been\r\nthe ancient soldiery of Arminius, took arms; but to him too revolted\r\nthe Semnones and Langobards, both Suevian nations, and even subjects of\r\nMaroboduus; and by their accession he would have exceeded in puissance,\r\nbut Inguiomerus with his band of followers deserted to Maroboduus; for\r\nno other cause than disdain, that an old man and an uncle like himself\r\nshould obey Arminius, a young man, his nephew. Both armies were drawn\r\nout, with equal hopes; nor disjointed, like the old German battles, into\r\nscattered parties for loose and random attacks; for by long war with us\r\nthey had learnt to follow their ensigns, to strengthen their main body\r\nwith parties of reserves, and to observe the orders of their generals.\r\nArminius was now on horseback viewing all the ranks: as he rode through\r\nthem he magnified their past feats; \"their liberty recovered; the\r\nslaughtered legions; the spoils of arms wrested from the Romans;\r\nmonuments of victory still retained in some of their hands.\" Upon\r\nMaroboduus he fell with contumelious names, as \"a fugitive, one of\r\nno abilities in war; a coward who had sought defence from the gloomy\r\ncoverts of the Hercynian woods, and then by gifts and solicitations\r\ncourted the alliance of Rome; a betrayer of his country, and a\r\nlifeguard-man of Caesar's, worthy to be exterminated with no less\r\nhostile vengeance than in the slaughter of Quinctilius Varus they had\r\nshown. Let them only remember so many battles bravely fought; the\r\nevents of which, particularly the utter expulsion of the Romans, were\r\nsufficient proofs with whom remained the glory of the war.\"\r\n\r\nNeither did Maroboduus fail to boast himself and depreciate the foe. \"In\r\nthe person of Inguiomerus,\" he said (holding him by the hand), \"rested\r\nthe whole renown of the Cheruscans; and from his counsels began all\r\ntheir exploits that ended in success. Arminius, a man of a frantic\r\nspirit, and a novice in affairs, assumed to himself the glory of\r\nanother, for having by treachery surprised three legions, which expected\r\nno foe, and their leader, who feared no fraud; a base surprise, revenged\r\nsince on Germany with heavy slaughters, and on Arminius himself with\r\ndomestic infamy, while his wife and his son still bore the bonds of\r\ncaptivity. For himself, when attacked formerly by Tiberius at the head\r\nof twelve legions, he had preserved unstained the glory of Germany, and\r\non equal terms ended the war. Nor did he repent of the treaty, since it\r\nwas still in their hands to wage anew equal war with the Romans, or\r\nsave blood and maintain peace.\" The armies, besides the incitements from\r\nthese speeches, were animated by national stimulations of their own.\r\nThe Cheruscans fought for their ancient renown; the Langobards for their\r\nrecent liberty; and the Suevians and their king, on the contrary, were\r\nstruggling for the augmentation of their monarchy. Never did armies make\r\na fiercer onset; never had onset a more ambiguous event; for both the\r\nright wings were routed, and hence a fresh encounter was certainly\r\nexpected, till Maroboduus drew off his army and encamped upon the\r\nhills; a manifest sign this that he was humbled. Frequent desertions too\r\nleaving him at last naked of forces, he retired to the Marcomannians,\r\nand thence sent ambassadors to Tiberius to implore succours. They were\r\nanswered, \"That he had no right to invoke aid of the Roman arms against\r\nthe Cheruscans, since to the Romans, while they were warring with\r\nthe same foe, he had never administered any assistance.\" Drusus was,\r\nhowever, sent away, as I have said, with the character of a negotiator\r\nof peace.\r\n\r\nThe same year twelve noble cities of Asia were overturned by an\r\nearthquake: the ruin happened in the night, and the more dreadful as its\r\nwarnings were unobserved; neither availed the usual sanctuary against\r\nsuch calamities, namely, a flight to the fields, since those who\r\nfled, the gaping earth devoured. It is reported \"that mighty mountains\r\nsubsided, plains were heaved into high hills: and that with flashes and\r\neruptions of fire, the mighty devastation was everywhere accompanied.\"\r\nThe Sardians felt most heavily the rage of the concussion, and therefore\r\nmost compassion: Tiberius promised them an hundred thousand great\r\nsesterces, [Footnote: £83,000.] and remitted their taxes for five years.\r\nThe inhabitants of Magnesia, under Mount Sipylus, were held the next in\r\nsufferings, and had proportionable relief. The Temnians, Philadelphians,\r\nthe Aegeatans, Apollonians, with those called the Mostenians or\r\nMacedonians of Hyrcania, the cities too of Hierocaesarea, Cyme, and\r\nTmolus, were all for the same term eased of tribute. It was likewise\r\nresolved to send one of the Senate to view the desolations and\r\nadminister proper remedies: Marcus Aletus was therefore chosen, one of\r\nPraetorian rank; because, a Consular Senator then governing Asia, had\r\nanother of the like quality been sent, an emulation between equals was\r\napprehended, and consequently opposition and delays.\r\n\r\nThe credit of this noble bounty to the public, he increased by private\r\nliberalities, which proved equally popular: the estate of the wealthy\r\nAemilia Musa, claimed by the exchequer, as she died intestate, he\r\nsurrendered to Aemilius Lepidus, to whose family she seemed to belong;\r\nas also to Marcus Servilius the inheritance of Patuleius, a rich Roman\r\nknight, though part of it had been bequeathed to himself; but he found\r\nServilius named sole heir in a former and well-attested will. He said\r\nsuch was \"the nobility of both, that they deserved to be supported.\" Nor\r\ndid he ever to himself accept any man's inheritance, but where former\r\nfriendship gave him a title. The wills of such as were strangers to him,\r\nand of such as, from hate and prejudice to others, had appointed the\r\nPrince their heir, he utterly rejected. But, as he relieved the honest\r\npoverty of the virtuous, so he degraded from the Senate (or suffered\r\nto quit it of their own accord) Vibidius Varro, Marius Nepos, Appius\r\nAppianus, Cornelius Sylla, and Quintus Vitellius, all prodigals, and\r\nonly through debauchery indigent.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Tiberius finished and consecrated what Augustus began,\r\nthe Temples of the Gods consumed by age or fire: that near the great\r\nCircus, vowed by Aulus Posthumius the Dictator, to Bacchus, Proserpina,\r\nand Ceres. In the same place the Temple of Flora, founded by Lucius\r\nPublicius and Marcus Publicius while they were Aediles. The Temple of\r\nJanus, built in the Herb Market by Caius Duillius, who first\r\nsignalised the Roman power at sea, and merited a naval triumph over the\r\nCarthaginians. That of Hope was dedicated by Germanicus: this temple\r\nAtilius had vowed in the same war.\r\n\r\nThe Consuls for the following year were, Tiberius the third time,\r\nGermanicus the second. This dignity overtook Germanicus at Nicopolis,\r\na city of Achaia, whither he arrived by the coast of Illyricum, from\r\nvisiting his brother Drusus, then abiding in Dalmatia; and had suffered\r\na tempestuous passage, both in the Adriatic and Ionian Sea: he therefore\r\nspent a few days to repair his fleet, and viewed the while the Bay\r\nof Actium renowned for the naval victory there; as also the spoils\r\nconsecrated by Augustus, and the Camp of Anthony, with an affecting\r\nremembrance of these his ancestors; for Anthony, as I have said, was\r\nhis great uncle, Augustus his grandfather; hence this scene proved to\r\nGermanicus a mighty source of images pleasing and sad. Next he proceeded\r\nto Athens, where in concession to that ancient city, allied to Rome,\r\nhe would use but one Lictor. The Greeks received him with the most\r\nelaborate honours, and to dignify their personal flattery, carried\r\nbefore him tablatures of the signal deeds and sayings of his ancestors.\r\n\r\nHence he sailed to Eubea, thence to Lesbos, where Agrippina was\r\ndelivered of Julia, who proved her last birth; then he kept the coast of\r\nAsia and visited Perinthus and Byzantium, cities of Thrace, and entered\r\nthe straits of Propontis, and the mouth of the Euxine; fond of beholding\r\nancient places long celebrated by fame: he relieved at the same time,\r\nthe provinces wherever distracted with intestine factions, or aggrieved\r\nwith the oppressions of their magistrates. In his return he strove to\r\nsee the religious rites of the Samothracians, but by the violence of the\r\nnorth wind was repulsed from the shore. As he passed, he saw Troy and\r\nher remains, venerable for the vicissitude of her fate, and for the\r\nbirth of Rome: regaining the coast of Asia, he put in at Colophon, to\r\nconsult there the oracle of the Clarian Apollo: it is no Pythoness that\r\nrepresents the God here, as at Delphos, but a Priest, one chosen from\r\ncertain families, chiefly of Miletus; neither requires he more than just\r\nto hear the names and numbers of the querists, and then descends into\r\nthe oracular cave; where, after a draught of water from a secret spring,\r\nthough ignorant for the most part of letters and poetry, he yet utters\r\nhis answers in verse, which has for its subject the conceptions and\r\nwishes of each consultant. He was even said to have sung to Germanicus\r\nhis hastening fate, but as oracles are wont, in terms dark and doubtful.\r\n\r\nBut Cneius Piso, hurrying to the execution of his purposes, terrified\r\nthe city of Athens by a tempestuous entry, and reproached them in a\r\nsevere speech, with oblique censure of Germanicus, \"that debasing the\r\ndignity of the Roman name, he had paid excessive court, not to the\r\nAthenians by so many slaughters long since extinct, but to the then\r\nmixed scum of nations there; for that these were they who had leagued\r\nwith Mithridates against Sylla, and with Anthony against Augustus.\" He\r\neven charged them with the errors and misfortunes of ancient Athens; her\r\nimpotent attempts against the Macedonians; her violence and ingratitude\r\nto her own citizens. He was also an enemy to their city from personal\r\nanger; because they would not pardon at his request one Theophilus\r\ncondemned by the Areopagus for forgery. From thence sailing hastily\r\nthrough the Cyclades, and taking the shortest course, he overtook\r\nGermanicus at Rhodes, but was there driven by a sudden tempest upon\r\nthe rocks: and Germanicus, who was not ignorant with what malignity and\r\ninvectives he was pursued, yet acted with so much humanity, that when\r\nhe might have left him to perish, and to casualty have referred the\r\ndestruction of his enemy; he despatched galleys to rescue him from the\r\nwreck. This generous kindness however assuaged not the animosity of\r\nPiso; and scarce could he brook a day's delay with Germanicus, but left\r\nhim in haste to arrive in Syria before him: nor was he sooner there, and\r\nfound himself amongst the legions, than he began to court the common\r\nmen by bounties and caresses, to assist them with his countenance and\r\ncredit, to form factions, to remove all the ancient centurions and every\r\ntribune of remarkable discipline and severity, and, in their places, to\r\nput dependents of his own, or men recommended only by their crimes; he\r\npermitted sloth in the camp, licentiousness in the towns, a rambling\r\nand disorderly soldiery, and carried the corruption so high, that in the\r\ndiscourses of the herd, he was styled _Father of the Legions_. Nor did\r\nPlancina restrain herself to a conduct seemly in her sex, but frequented\r\nthe exercises of the cavalry, and attended the decursions of the\r\ncohorts; everywhere inveighing against Agrippina, everywhere against\r\nGermanicus; and some even of the most deserving soldiers became prompt\r\nto base obedience, from a rumour whispered abroad, \"that all this was\r\nnot unacceptable to Tiberius.\"\r\n\r\nThese doings were all known to Germanicus; but his more instant care\r\nwas to visit Armenia, an inconstant and restless nation this from the\r\nbeginning; inconstant from the genius of the people, as well as from the\r\nsituation of their country, which bordering with a large frontier on our\r\nprovinces, and stretching thence quite to Media, is enclosed between\r\nthe two great Empires, and often at variance with them; with the Romans\r\nthrough antipathy and hatred, with the Parthians through competition and\r\nenvy. At this time and ever since the removal of Vonones, they had no\r\nking; but the affections of the nations leaned to Zeno, son of Polemon,\r\nking of Pontus, because by an attachment, from his infancy, to the\r\nfashions and customs of the Armenians, by hunting, feasting, and other\r\nusages practised and renowned amongst the barbarians, he had equally won\r\nthe nobles and people. Upon his head therefore, at the city of Artaxata,\r\nwith the approbation of the nobles, in a great assembly, Germanicus put\r\nthe regal diadem; and the Armenians doing homage to their king, saluted\r\nhim, _Artaxias_, a name which from that of their city, they gave him.\r\nThe Cappadocians, at this time reduced into the form of a province,\r\nreceived for their governor Quintus Veranius; and to raise their\r\nhopes of the gentler dominion of Rome, several of the royal taxes were\r\nlessened. Quintus Servaeus was set over the Comagenians, then first\r\nsubjected to the jurisdiction of a Praetor.\r\n\r\nFrom the affairs of the allies, thus all successfully settled,\r\nGermanicus reaped no pleasure, through the perverseness and pride of\r\nPiso, who was ordered to lead by himself or his son, part of the legions\r\ninto Armenia, but contemptuously neglected to do either. They at last\r\nmet at Cyrrum, the winter quarters of the tenth legion, whither each\r\ncame with a prepared countenance; Piso to betray no fear, and Germanicus\r\nwould not be thought to threaten. He was indeed, as I have observed,\r\nof a humane and reconcilable spirit: but, officious friends expert at\r\ninflaming animosities, aggravated real offences, added fictitious, and\r\nwith manifold imputations charged Piso, Plancina, and their sons.\r\nTo this interview Germanicus admitted a few intimates, and began his\r\ncomplaints in words such as dissembled resentment dictates. Piso replied\r\nwith disdainful submissions; and they parted in open enmity. Piso\r\nhereafter came rarely to the tribunal of Germanicus; or, if he did, sate\r\nsternly there, and in manifest opposition: he likewise published his\r\nspite at a feast of the Nabathean King's, where golden crowns of great\r\nweight were presented to Germanicus and Agrippina; but to Piso and the\r\nrest, such as were light: \"This banquet,\" he said, \"was made for the son\r\nof a Roman prince, not of a Parthian monarch:\" with these words, he\r\ncast away his crown, and uttered many invectives against luxury: sharp\r\ninsults and provocations these to Germanicus; yet he bore them.\r\n\r\nIn the consulship of Marcus Silanus and Lucius Norbanus, Germanicus\r\ntravelled to Egypt, to view the famous antiquities of the country;\r\nthough for the motives of the journey, the care and inspection of the\r\nprovince were publicly alleged: and, indeed, by opening the granaries,\r\nhe mitigated the price of corn, and practised many things grateful to\r\nthe people; walking without guards, his feet bare, and his habit the\r\nsame with that of the Greeks; after the example of Publius Scipio, who,\r\nwe are told, was constant in the same practices in Sicily, even during\r\nthe rage of the Punic War there. For these his assumed manners and\r\nforeign habit, Tiberius blamed him in a gentle style, but censured him\r\nwith great asperity for violating an establishment of Augustus, and\r\nentering Alexandria without consent of the Prince. For Augustus, amongst\r\nother secrets of power, had appropriated Egypt, and restrained the\r\nsenators, and dignified Roman knights from going thither without\r\nlicence; as he apprehended that Italy might be distressed with famine by\r\nany who seized that province, the key to the Empire by sea and land, and\r\ndefensible by a light band of men against potent armies.\r\n\r\nGermanicus, not yet informed that his journey was censured, sailed up\r\nthe Nile, beginning at Canopus, [Footnote: Near Aboukir.] one of its\r\nmouths: it was built by the Spartans, as a monument to Canopus, a pilot\r\nburied there, at the time when Menelaus returning to Greece was driven\r\nto different seas and the Lybian continent. Hence he visited the next\r\nmouth of the river sacred to Hercules: him the nations aver to have been\r\nborn amongst them; that he was the most ancient of the name, and that\r\nall the rest, who with equal virtue followed his example, were, in\r\nhonour, called after him. Next he visited the mighty antiquities of\r\nancient Thebes; [Footnote: Karnak and Luxor.] where upon huge obelisks\r\nyet remained Egyptian characters, describing its former opulency: one of\r\nthe oldest priests was ordered to interpret them; he said they related\r\n\"that it once contained seven hundred thousand fighting men; that with\r\nthat army King Rhamses had conquered Lybia, Ethiopia, the Medes and\r\nPersians, the Bactrians and Scythians; and to his Empire had added\r\nthe territories of the Syrians, Armenians, and their neighbours the\r\nCappadocians; a tract of countries reaching from the sea of Bithynia to\r\nthat of Lycia:\" here also was read the assessment of tribute laid on the\r\nseveral nations; what weight of silver and gold; what number of horses\r\nand arms; what ivory and perfumes, as gifts to the temples; what\r\nmeasures of grain; what quantities of all necessaries, were by\r\neach people paid; revenues equally grand with those exacted by the\r\ndenomination of the Parthians, or by the power of the Romans.\r\n\r\nGermanicus was intent upon seeing other wonders: the chief were; the\r\neffigies of Memnon, a colossus of stone, yielding when struck by the\r\nsolar rays, a vocal sound; the Pyramids rising, like mountains, amongst\r\nrolling and almost impassable waves of sand; monuments these of the\r\nemulation and opulency of Egyptian kings; the artificial lake, a\r\nreceptacle of the overflowing Nile; and elsewhere abysses of such\r\nimmense depth, that those, who tried, could never fathom. Thence he\r\nproceeded to Elephantina and Syene, two islands, formerly frontiers of\r\nthe Roman empire, which is now widened to the Red Sea.\r\n\r\nWhilst Germanicus spent this summer in several provinces, Drusus was\r\nsowing feuds amongst the Germans, and thence reaped no light renown;\r\nand, as the power of Maroboduus was already broken, he engaged them to\r\npersist and complete his ruin. Amongst the Gotones was a young man of\r\nquality, his name Catualda, a fugitive long since from the violence of\r\nMaroboduus, but now in his distress, resolved on revenge: hence with a\r\nstout band, he entered the borders of the Marcomannians, and corrupting\r\ntheir chiefs into his alliance, stormed the regal palace, and the castle\r\nsituate near it. In the pillage were found the ancient stores of prey\r\naccumulated by the Suevians; as also many victuallers and traders from\r\nour provinces; men who were drawn hither from their several homes, first\r\nby privilege of traffic, then retained by a passion to multiply gain,\r\nand at last, through utter oblivion of their own country, fixed, like\r\nnatives, in a hostile soil.\r\n\r\nTo Maroboduus on every side forsaken, no other refuge remained but the\r\nmercy of Caesar: he therefore passed the Danube where it washes the\r\nprovince of Norica, and wrote to Tiberius; not however in the language\r\nof a fugitive or supplicant, but with a spirit suitable to his late\r\ngrandeur, \"that many nations invited him to them, as a king once so\r\nglorious; but he preferred to all the friendship of Rome.\" The Emperor\r\nanswered, \"that in Italy he should have a safe and honourable retreat,\r\nand, when his affairs required his presence, the same security to\r\nreturn.\" But to the Senate he declared, \"that never had Philip of\r\nMacedon been so terrible to the Athenians; nor Pyrrhus, nor Antiochus\r\nto the Roman people.\" The speech is extant: in it he magnifies \"the\r\ngreatness of the man, the fierceness and bravery of the nations his\r\nsubjects; the alarming nearness of such an enemy to Italy, and his own\r\nartful measures to destroy him.\" Maroboduus was kept at Ravenna, for\r\na check and terror to the Suevians; as if, when at any time they grew\r\nturbulent, he were there in readiness to recover their subjection: yet\r\nin eighteen years he left not Italy, but grew old in exile there; his\r\nrenown too became eminently diminished; such was the price he paid for\r\nan over-passionate love of life. The same fate had Catualda, and\r\nno other sanctuary; he was soon after expulsed by the forces of the\r\nHermundurans led by Vibilius, and being received under the Roman\r\nprotection, was conveyed to Forum Julium, a colony in Narbon Gaul.\r\nThe barbarians their followers, lest, had they been mixed with the\r\nprovinces, they might have disturbed their present quiet, were placed\r\nbeyond the Danube, between the rivers Marus and Cusus, and for their\r\nking had assigned them Vannius, by nation a Quadian.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was known at Rome, that Artaxias was by Germanicus given\r\nto the Armenians for their king, the fathers decreed to him and Drusus\r\nthe lesser triumph: triumphal arches were likewise erected, on each side\r\nof the Temple of Mars the Avenger, supporting the statues of these two\r\nCaesars; and for Tiberius, he was more joyful to have established peace\r\nby policy, than if by battles and victories he had ended the war.\r\n\r\nGermanicus returning from Egypt, learned that all his orders left with\r\nthe legions, and the eastern cities, were either entirely abolished,\r\nor contrary regulations established: a ground this for his severe\r\nreproaches and insults upon Piso. Nor less keen were the efforts and\r\nmachinations of Piso against Germanicus; yet Piso afterwards determined\r\nto leave Syria, but was detained by the following illness of Germanicus:\r\nagain when he heard of his recovery, and perceived that vows were paid\r\nfor his restoration; the Lictors, by his command, broke the solemnity,\r\ndrove away the victims already at the altars; overturned the apparatus\r\nof the sacrifice; and scattered the people of Antioch employed in\r\ncelebrating the festival. He then departed to Seleucia, waiting the\r\nevent of the malady which had again assaulted Germanicus. His own\r\npersuasion too, that poison was given him by Piso, heightened the cruel\r\nvehemence of the disease: indeed, upon the floors and walls were found\r\nfragments of human bodies, the spoils of the grave; with charms and\r\nincantations; and the name of Germanicus graved on sheets of lead;\r\ncarcasses half burnt, besmeared with gore; and other witchcrafts, by\r\nwhich souls are thought doomed to the infernal gods: besides there\r\nwere certain persons, charged as creatures of Piso, purposely sent and\r\nemployed to watch the progress and efforts of the disease.\r\n\r\nThese things filled Germanicus with apprehensions great as his\r\nresentment: \"If his doors,\" he said, \"were besieged, if under the eyes\r\nof his enemies he must render up his spirit, what was to be expected to\r\nhis unhappy wife, what to his infant children?\" The progress of poison\r\nwas thought too slow; Piso was impatient, and urging with eagerness to\r\ncommand alone the legions, to possess alone the province: but Germanicus\r\nwas not sunk to such lowness and impotence, that the price of his murder\r\nshould remain with the murderer: and by a letter to Piso, he renounced\r\nhis friendship: some add, that he commanded him to depart the province.\r\nNor did Piso tarry longer, but took ship; yet checked her sailing in\r\norder to return with the more quickness, should the death of Germanicus\r\nthe while leave the government of Syria vacant.\r\n\r\nGermanicus, after a small revival, drooping again; when his end\r\napproached, spoke on this wise to his attending friends: \"Were I to\r\nyield to the destiny of nature; just, even then, were my complaints\r\nagainst the Gods, for hurrying me from my parents, my children, and my\r\ncountry, by a hasty death, in the prime of life: now shortened in my\r\ncourse by the malignity of Piso, and his wife, to your breasts I commit\r\nmy last prayers: tell my father, tell my brother, with what violent\r\npersecutions afflicted, with what mortal snares circumvented, I end a\r\nmost miserable life by death of all others the worst. All they whose\r\nhopes in my fortune, all they whose kindred blood, and even they whose\r\nenvy, possessed them with impressions about me whilst living, shall\r\nbewail me dead; that once great in glory, and surviving so many wars, I\r\nfell at last by the dark devices of a woman. To you will be place left\r\nto complain in the Senate, and place to invoke the aid and vengeance\r\nof the laws. To commemorate the dead with slothful wailings, is not the\r\nprincipal office of friends: they are to remember his dying wishes, to\r\nfulfil his last desires. Even strangers will lament Germanicus: you are\r\nmy friends: if you loved me rather than my fortune, you will vindicate\r\nyour friendship: show the people of Rome my wife, her who is the\r\ngrand-daughter of Augustus, and enumerate to them our six children.\r\nTheir compassion will surely attend you who accuse; and the accused, if\r\nthey pretend clandestine warrants of iniquity, will not be believed;\r\nif believed, not pardoned.\" His friends, as a pledge of their fidelity,\r\ntouching the hand of the dying prince, swore that they would forego\r\ntheir lives sooner than their revenge. Then turning to his wife, he\r\nbesought her \"that in tenderness to his memory, in tenderness to their\r\ncommon children, she would banish her haughty spirit, yield to\r\nher hostile fortune, nor, upon her return to Rome, by an impotent\r\ncompetition for ruling, irritate those who were masters of rule.\" So\r\nmuch openly, and more in secret; whence he was believed to have warned\r\nher of guile and danger from Tiberius. Soon after he expired, to the\r\nheavy sorrow of the province, and of all the neighbouring countries;\r\ninsomuch that remote nations and foreign kings were mourners: such\r\nhad been his complacency to our confederates; such his humanity to his\r\nenemies! Alike venerable he was, whether you saw him or heard him; and\r\nwithout ever departing from the grave port and dignity of his sublime\r\nrank, he yet lived destitute of arrogance and untouched by envy.\r\n\r\nThe funeral, which was performed without exterior pomp or a procession\r\nof images, drew its solemnity from the loud praises and amiable memory\r\nof his virtues. There were those who from his loveliness, his age,\r\nhis manner of dying, and even from the proximity of places where both\r\ndeparted, compared him in the circumstances of his fate, to Great\r\nAlexander: \"Each of a graceful person, each of illustrious descent;\r\nin years neither much exceeding thirty; both victims to the malice and\r\nmachinations of their own people, in the midst of foreign nations: but\r\nGermanicus gentle towards his friends; his pleasures moderate; confined\r\nto one wife; all his children by one bed; nor less a warrior, though not\r\nso rash, and however hindered from a final reduction of Germany, broken\r\nby him in so many victories, and ready for the yoke: so that had he been\r\nsole arbiter of things, had he acted with the sovereignty and title of\r\nroyalty, he had easier overtaken him in the glory of conquests, as he\r\nsurpassed him in clemency, in moderation, and in other virtues.\" His\r\nbody, before its commitment to the pile, was exhibited naked in the\r\nForum of Antioch, the place where the pile was erected: whether it\r\nbore the marks of poison, remained undecided: for, people as they were\r\ndivided in their affections, as they pitied Germanicus, and presumed the\r\nguilt of Piso, or were partial to him, gave opposite accounts.\r\n\r\nIt was next debated amongst the legates of the legions and the other\r\nsenators there, to whom should be committed the administration of Syria:\r\nand after the faint effort of others, it was long disputed between\r\nVibius Marsus and Cneius Sentius: Marsus at last yielded to Sentius, the\r\nolder man and the more vehement competitor. By him one Martina, infamous\r\nin that province for practices in poisoning, and a close confidant of\r\nPlancina, was sent to Rome, at the suit of Vitellius, Veranius, and\r\nothers, who were preparing criminal articles against Piso and Plancina,\r\nas against persons evidently guilty.\r\n\r\nAgrippina, though overwhelmed with sorrow, and her body indisposed,\r\nyet impatient of all delays to her revenge, embarked with the ashes of\r\nGermanicus, and her children; attended with universal commiseration,\r\n\"that a lady, in quality a princess, wont to be beheld in her late\r\nsplendid wedlock with applauses and adorations, was now seen bearing in\r\nher bosom her husband's funeral urn, uncertain of vengeance for him and\r\nfearful for herself; unfortunate in her fruitfulness, and from so many\r\nchildren obnoxious to so many blows of fortune.\" Piso the while was\r\novertaken at the Isle of Coös by a message, \"that Germanicus was\r\ndeceased,\" and received it intemperately, slew victims and repaired with\r\nthanksgiving to the temples: and yet, however immoderate and undisguised\r\nwas his joy, more arrogant and insulting proved that of Plancina, who\r\nimmediately threw off her mourning, which for the death of a sister she\r\nwore, and assumed a dress adapted to gaiety and gladness.\r\n\r\nAbout him flocked the Centurions with officious representations, \"that\r\nupon him particularly were bent the affections and zeal of the legions,\r\nand he should proceed to resume the province, at first injuriously taken\r\nfrom him and now destitute of a governor.\" As he therefore consulted\r\nwhat he had best pursue, his son Marcus Piso advised \"a speedy journey\r\nto Rome: hitherto,\" he said, \"nothing past expiation was committed; nor\r\nwere impotent suspicions to be dreaded; nor the idle blazonings of fame:\r\nhis variance and contention with Germanicus was perhaps subject to hate\r\nand aversion, but to no prosecution or penalty; and, by bereaving him of\r\nthe province, his enemies were gratified: but if he returned thither, as\r\nSentius would certainly oppose him with arms, a civil war would thence\r\nbe actually begun: neither would the Centurions and soldiers persist in\r\nhis party; men with whom the recent memory of their late commander, and\r\nan inveterate love to the Caesarian general, were still prevalent.\"\r\n\r\nDomitius Celer, one in intimate credit with Piso, argued on the\r\ncontrary, \"that the present event must by all means be improved; it was\r\nPiso and not Sentius who had commission to govern Syria; upon him, were\r\nconferred the jurisdiction of Praetor, and the badges of magistracy, and\r\nwith him the legions were instructed: so that if acts of hostility were\r\nby his opponents attempted, with how much better warrant could he avow\r\nassuming arms in his own right and defence, who was thus vested with the\r\nauthority of general, and acted under special orders from the Emperor.\r\nRumours too were to be neglected, and left to perish with time: in\r\ntruth to the sallies and violence of recent hate the innocent were often\r\nunequal: but were he once possessed of the army, and had well augmented\r\nhis forces, many things, not to be foreseen, would from fortune derive\r\nsuccess. Are we then preposterously hastening to arrive at Rome with the\r\nashes of Germanicus, that you may there fall, unheard and undefended, a\r\nvictim to the wailings of Agrippina, a prey to the passionate populace\r\ngoverned by the first impressions of rumour? Livia, it is true, is your\r\nconfederate; Tiberius is your friend; but both secretly: and indeed none\r\nwill more pompously bewail the violent fate of Germanicus, than such as\r\nfor it do most sincerely rejoice.\"\r\n\r\nPiso of himself prompt to violent pursuits, was with no great labour\r\npersuaded into this opinion, and, in a letter transmitted to Tiberius,\r\naccused Germanicus \"of luxury and pride: that for himself, he had been\r\nexpulsed, to leave room for dangerous designs against the State, and now\r\nresumed, with his former faith and loyalty, the care of the army.\" In\r\nthe meantime he put Domitius on board a galley, and ordered him to avoid\r\nappearing upon the coasts or amongst the isles, but, through the\r\nmain sea, to sail to Syria. The deserters, who from all quarters were\r\nflocking to him in crowds, he formed into companies, and armed all the\r\nretainers to the camp; then sailing over to the continent, intercepted\r\na regiment of recruits, upon their march into Syria; and wrote to the\r\nsmall kings of Cilicia to assist him with present succours: nor was\r\nthe younger Piso slow in prosecuting all the measures of war, though to\r\nadventure a war had been against his sentiments and advice.\r\n\r\nAs they coasted Lycia and Pamphilia, they encountered the ships which\r\ncarried Agrippina, with hostile spirit on each side, and each at first\r\nprepared for combat; but as equal dread of one another possessed\r\nboth, proceeded not further than mutual contumelies. Vibius Marsus\r\nparticularly summoned Piso, as a criminal, to Rome, there to make his\r\ndefence: he answered with derision \"that when the Praetor, who was to\r\nsit upon poisonings, had assigned a day to the accusers and the accused,\r\nhe would attend.\" Domitius, the while, landing at Laodicea, a city of\r\nSyria, would have proceeded to the winter quarters of the sixth legion,\r\nwhich he believed to be the most prone to engage in novel attempts, but\r\nwas prevented by Pacuvius, its commander. Sentius represented this by\r\nletter to Piso, and warned him, \"at his peril to infect the camp by\r\nministers of corruption; or to assail the province of war;\" and drew\r\ninto a body such as he knew loved Germanicus, or such as were averse to\r\nhis foes: upon them he inculcated with much ardour, that Piso was with\r\nopen arms attacking the majesty of the Prince, and invading the Roman\r\nState; and then marched at the head of a puissant body, equipped for\r\nbattle and resolute to engage.\r\n\r\nNeither failed Piso, though his enterprises had thus far miscarried, to\r\napply the securest remedies to his present perplexities; and therefore\r\nseized a castle of Cilicia strongly fortified, its name Celendris: for,\r\nto the auxiliary Cilicians, sent him by the petty kings, he had joined\r\nhis body of deserters, as also the recruits lately intercepted, with all\r\nhis own and Plancina's slaves; and thus in number and bulk had of\r\nthe whole composed a legion. To them he thus harangued: \"I who am the\r\nlieutenant of Caesar, am yet violently excluded from the province which\r\nto me Caesar has committed: not excluded by the legions (for by their\r\ninvitation I am arrived), but by Sentius, who thus disguises under\r\nfeigned crimes against me, his own animosity and personal hate: but with\r\nconfidence you may stand in battle, where the opposite army, upon the\r\nsight of Piso, a commander lately by themselves styled their _Father_,\r\nwill certainly refuse to fight; they know too, that were right to decide\r\nit, I am the stronger; and of no mean puissance in a trial at arms.\"\r\nHe then arrayed his men without the fortifications, on a hill steep and\r\ncraggy, for all the rest was begirt by the sea: against them stood the\r\nveterans regularly embattled, and supported with a body of reserve;\r\nso that here appeared the force of men, there only the terror and\r\nstubbornness of situation. On Piso's side was no spirit, nor hope,\r\nnor even weapons save those of rustics, for instant necessity hastily\r\nacquired. As soon as they came to blows, the issue was no longer\r\ndoubtful than while the Roman cohorts struggled up the steep: the\r\nCilicians then fled, and shut themselves up in the castle.\r\n\r\nPiso having the while attempted in vain to storm the fleet, which rode\r\nat a small distance, as soon as he returned, presented himself upon the\r\nwalls; where, by a succession of passionate complaints and entreaties,\r\nnow bemoaning in agonies the bitterness of his lot, then calling and\r\ncajolling every particular soldier by his name, and by rewards tempting\r\nall, he laboured to excite a sedition; and thus much had already\r\neffected, that the Eagle-bearer of the sixth legion revolted to him with\r\nhis Eagle. This alarmed Sentius, and instantly he commanded the cornets\r\nand trumpets to sound, a mound to be raised, the ladders placed, and\r\nthe bravest men to mount, and others to pour from the engines volleys of\r\ndarts and stones, and flaming torches. The obstinacy of Piso was at\r\nlast vanquished; and he desired \"that upon delivering his arms he might\r\nremain in the castle till the Emperor's pleasure, to whom he would\r\ncommit the government of Syria, were known;\" conditions which were not\r\naccepted; nor was aught granted him save ships and a passport to Rome.\r\n\r\nAfter the illness of Germanicus grew current there, and all its\r\ncircumstances, like rumours magnified by distance, were related\r\nwith many aggravations; sadness seized the people; they burned with\r\nindignation, and even poured out in plaints the anguish of their souls.\r\n\"For this,\" they said, \"he had been banished to the extremities of the\r\nEmpire, for this the province of Syria was committed to Piso, and these\r\nthe fruits of Livia's mysterious conferences with Plancina: truly had\r\nour fathers spoken concerning his father Drusus; that the possessors of\r\nrule beheld with an evil eye the popular spirit of their sons; nor for\r\naught else were they sacrificed, but for their equal treatment of\r\nthe Roman People, and studying to restore the popular state.\" These\r\nlamentations of the populace were, upon the tidings of his death, so\r\ninflamed, that, without staying for an edict from the magistrates,\r\nwithout a decree of Senate, they by general consent assumed a vacation;\r\nthe public courts were deserted, private houses shut up, prevalent\r\neverywhere were the symptoms of woe, heavy groans, dismal silence; the\r\nwhole a scene of real sorrow, and nothing devised for form or show; and,\r\nthough they forbore not to bear the exterior marks and habiliments of\r\nmourning; in their souls they mourned still deeper. Accidentally some\r\nmerchants from Syria, who had left Germanicus still alive, brought\r\nmore joyful news of his condition: these were instantly believed, and\r\ninstantly proclaimed: each, as fast as they met, informed others,\r\nwho forthwith conveyed their light information with improvements and\r\naccumulated joy to more, and all flew with exultation through the city;\r\nand, to pay their thanks and vows, burst open the temple doors: the\r\nnight too heightened their credulity, and affirmation was bolder in the\r\ndark. Nor did Tiberius restrain the course of these fictions, but left\r\nthem to vanish with time: hence with more bitterness they afterwards\r\ngrieved for him, as if anew snatched from them.\r\n\r\nHonours were invented and decreed to Germanicus, various as the\r\naffections and genius of the particular Senators who proposed them:\r\n\"that his name should be sung in the Salian hymns; curule chairs placed\r\nfor him amongst the priests of Augustus, and over these chairs oaken\r\ncrowns hung; his statue in ivory precede in the Cercensian games; none\r\nbut one of the Julian race be, in the room of Germanicus, created flamen\r\nor augur:\" triumphal arches were added; one at Rome; one upon the banks\r\nof the Rhine; one upon Mount Amanus, in Syria; with inscriptions of\r\nhis exploits, and a testimony subjoined, \"that he died for the\r\nCommonwealth:\" a sepulchre at Antioch, where his corpse was burnt; a\r\ntribunal at Epidaphne, the place where he ended his life. The multitude\r\nof statues, the many places where divine honours were appointed to be\r\npaid him, would not be easily recounted. They would have also decreed\r\nhim, as to one of the masters of eloquence, a golden shield, signal in\r\nbulk as in metal; but Tiberius offered to dedicate one himself, such\r\nas was usual and of a like size with others; for that eloquence was not\r\nmeasured by fortune; and it was sufficient glory, if he were ranked with\r\nancient writers. The battalion called after the name of the Junii was\r\nnow, by the equestrian order, entitled the battalion of Germanicus,\r\nand a rule made that, on every fifteenth of July, these troops should\r\nfollow, as their standard, the effigies of Germanicus: of these honours\r\nmany continue; some were instantly omitted, or by time are utterly\r\nobliterated.\r\n\r\nIn the height of this public sorrow, Livia, sister to Germanicus,\r\nand married to Drusus, was delivered of male twins: an event even in\r\nmiddling families, rare and acceptable, and to Tiberius such mighty\r\nmatter of joy, that he could not refrain boasting to the fathers, \"that\r\nto no Roman of the same eminence, before him, were never two children\r\nborn at a birth:\" for to his own glory he turned all things, even things\r\nfortuitous. But to the people, at such a sad conjuncture, it brought\r\nfresh anguish; as they feared that the family of Drusus thus increased,\r\nwould press heavy upon that of Germanicus.\r\n\r\nThe same year the lubricity of women was by the Senate restrained with\r\nsevere laws; and it was provided, \"that no woman should become venal, if\r\nher father, grandfather or husband, were Roman knights.\" For Vistilia,\r\na lady born of a Praetorian family, had before the Aediles published\r\nherself a prostitute; upon a custom allowed by our ancestors, who\r\nthought that prostitutes were by thus avowing their infamy, sufficiently\r\npunished. Titidius Labeo too was questioned, that in the manifest guilt\r\nof his wife, he had neglected the punishment prescribed by the law;\r\nbut he alleged that the sixty days allowed for consultation were not\r\nelapsed; and it was deemed sufficient to proceed against Vistilia,\r\nwho was banished to the Isle of Seriphos. Measures were also taken for\r\nexterminating the solemnities of the Jews and Egyptians; and by decree\r\nof Senate four thousand descendants of franchised slaves, all defiled\r\nwith that superstition, but of proper strength and age, were to be\r\ntransported to Sardinia; to restrain the Sardinian robbers; and if,\r\nthrough the malignity of the climate, they perished, despicable would be\r\nthe loss: the rest were doomed to depart Italy, unless by a stated day\r\nthey renounced their profane rites.\r\n\r\nAfter this Tiberius represented that, to supply the place of Occia, who\r\nhad presided seven and fifty years with the highest sanctimony over the\r\nVestals, another virgin was to be chosen; and thanked Fonteius Agrippa\r\nand Asinius Pollio, that by offering their daughters, they contended in\r\ngood offices towards the Commonwealth. Pollio's daughter was preferred;\r\nfor nothing else but that her mother had ever continued in the same\r\nwedlock: for Agrippa, by a divorce, had impaired the credit of his\r\nhouse: upon her who was postponed, Tiberius, in consolation, bestowed\r\nfor her fortune a thousand great sestertia. [Footnote: £8300.]\r\n\r\nAs the people murmured at the severe dearth of corn, he settled grain\r\nat a price certain to the buyer, and undertook to pay fourteenpence a\r\nmeasure to the seller: neither yet would he accept the name of _Father\r\nof his Country_, a title offered him before, and for these bounties, now\r\nagain; nay, he sharply rebuked such as styled these provisions of his,\r\n_divine occupations_, and him, _Lord_: hence freedom of speech became\r\ncramped and insecure, under such a Prince; one who dreaded liberty, and\r\nabhorred flattery.\r\n\r\nI find in the writers of those times, some of them Senators, that in\r\nthe Senate were read letters from Adgandestrius, prince of the Cattans,\r\nundertaking to despatch Arminius, if in order to it poison were sent\r\nhim; and an answer returned, \"that not by frauds and blows in the dark,\r\nbut armed and in the face of the sun, the Roman People took vengeance\r\non their foes.\" In this Tiberius gained equal glory with our ancient\r\ncaptains, who rejected and disclosed a plot to poison King Pyrrhus.\r\nArminius however, who upon the departure of the Romans and expulsion\r\nof Maroboduus, aimed at royalty, became thence engaged in a struggle\r\nagainst the liberty of his country; and, in defence of their liberty,\r\nhis countrymen took arms against him: so that, while with various\r\nfortune he contended with them, he fell by the treachery of his own\r\nkindred: the deliverer of Germany without doubt he was; one who\r\nassailed the Roman power, not like other kings and leaders, in its first\r\nelements, but in its highest pride and elevation; one sometimes beaten\r\nin battle, but never conquered in war: thirty-seven years he lived;\r\ntwelve he commanded; and, amongst these barbarous nations, his memory is\r\nstill celebrated in their songs; but his name unknown in the annals of\r\nthe Greeks, who only admire their own national exploits and renown; nor\r\neven amongst the Romans does this great captain bear much distinction,\r\nwhile, overlooking instances of modern prowess and glory, we only\r\ndelight to magnify men and feats of old.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK III\r\n\r\nA.D. 20-22.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgrippina, notwithstanding the roughness of winter, pursuing without\r\nintermission her boisterous voyage, put in at the Island Corcyra,\r\n[Footnote: Corfu.] situate over against the coasts of Calabria. Here\r\nto settle her spirit, she spent a few days, violent in her grief, and\r\na stranger to patience. Her arrival being the while divulged, all the\r\nparticular friends to her family, mostly men of the sword, many who had\r\nserved under Germanicus, and even many strangers from the neighbouring\r\ntowns, some in officiousness towards the Emperor, more for company,\r\ncrowded to the city of Brundusium, the readiest port in her way and the\r\nsafest landing. As soon as the fleet appeared in the deep, instantly\r\nwere filled, not the port alone and adjacent shores, but the walls\r\nand roofs, and as far as the eye could go; filled with the sorrowing\r\nmultitude. They were consulting one from one, how they should receive\r\nher landing, \"whether with universal silence, or with some note of\r\nacclamation.\" Nor was it manifest which they would do, when the fleet\r\nstood slowly in, not as usual with joyful sailors and cheerful oars, but\r\nall things impressed with the face of sadness. After she descended from\r\nthe ship, accompanied with her two infants, carrying in her bosom the\r\nmelancholy urn, with her eyes cast steadily down; equal and universal\r\nwere the groans of the beholders: nor could you distinguish relations\r\nfrom strangers, nor the wailings of men from those of women, unless\r\nthat the new-comers, who were recent in their sallies of grief, exceeded\r\nAgrippina's attendants, wearied out with long lamentations.\r\n\r\nTiberius had despatched two Praetorian cohorts, with directions, that\r\nthe magistrates of Calabria, Apulia and Campania, should pay their last\r\noffices to the memory of his son: upon the shoulders therefore of the\r\nTribunes and Centurions his ashes were borne; before went the ensigns\r\nrough and unadorned, with the fasces reversed. As they passed through\r\nthe colonies, the populace were in black, the knights in purple; and\r\neach place, according to its wealth, burnt precious raiment, perfumes\r\nand whatever else is used in funeral solemnities: even they whose cities\r\nlay remote attended: to the Gods of the dead they slew victims, they\r\nerected altars, and with tears and united lamentations, testified\r\ntheir common sorrow. Drusus came as far as Terracina, with Claudius the\r\nbrother of Germanicus, and those of his children who had been left at\r\nRome. The Consuls Marcus Valerius and Marcus Aurelius (just then entered\r\nupon their office), the Senate, and great part of the people, filled the\r\nroad; a scattered procession, each walking and weeping his own way: in\r\nthis mourning, flattery had no share; for all knew how real was the joy,\r\nhow hollow the grief, of Tiberius for the death of Germanicus.\r\n\r\nTiberius and Livia avoided appearing abroad: public lamentation they\r\nthought below their grandeur; or perhaps they apprehended that their\r\ncountenances, examined by all eyes, might show deceitful hearts. That\r\nAntonia, mother to the deceased, bore any part in the funeral, I do not\r\nfind either in the historians or in the city journals: though, besides\r\nAgrippina, and Drusus, and Claudius, his other relations are likewise\r\nthere recorded by name: whether by sickness she was prevented; or\r\nwhether her soul vanquished by sorrow, could not bear the representation\r\nof such a mighty calamity. I would rather believe her constrained\r\nby Tiberius and Livia, who left not the palace; and affecting equal\r\naffliction with her, would have it seem that, by the example of the\r\nmother, the grandmother too and uncle were detained.\r\n\r\nThe day his remains were reposited in the tomb of Augustus, various\r\nwere the symptoms of public grief; now the vastness of silence; now the\r\nuproar of lamentation; the city in every quarter full of processions;\r\nthe field of Mars on a blaze of torches: here the soldiers under arms,\r\nthe magistrates without the insignia, the people by their tribes, all\r\ncried in concert that \"the Commonwealth was fallen, and henceforth\r\nthere was no remain of hope;\" so openly and boldly that you would have\r\nbelieved they had forgot, who bore sway. But nothing pierced Tiberius\r\nmore than the ardent affections of the people towards Agrippina, while\r\nsuch titles they gave her as \"the ornament of her country, the only\r\nblood of Augustus, the single instance of ancient virtue;\" and, while\r\napplying to heaven, they implored \"the continuance of her issue, that\r\nthey might survive the persecuting and malignant.\"\r\n\r\nThere were those who missed the pomp of a public funeral, and compared\r\nwith this the superior honours and magnificence bestowed by Augustus on\r\nthat of Drusus the father of Germanicus; \"that he himself had travelled,\r\nin the sharpness of winter, as far as Pavia, and thence, continuing by\r\nthe corpse, had with it entered the city; round his head were placed\r\nthe images of the Claudii and Julii; he was mourned in the Forum; his\r\nencomium pronounced in the Rostras; all sorts of honours, such as were\r\nthe inventions of our ancestors, or the improvements of their posterity,\r\nwere heaped upon him. But to Germanicus were denied the ordinary\r\nsolemnities, and such as were due to every distinguished Roman. In a\r\nforeign country indeed, his corpse because of the long journey, was\r\nburnt without pomp; but afterwards, it was but just to have supplied\r\nthe scantiness of the first ceremony by the solemnity of the last: his\r\nbrother met him but one day's journey; his uncle not even at the gate.\r\nWhere were those generous observations of the ancients; the effigies of\r\nthe dead borne on a bed, hymns composed in memory of their virtue, with\r\nthe oblations of praise and tears? Where at least were the ceremonies\r\nand even outside of sorrow?\"\r\n\r\nAll this was known to Tiberius; and, to suppress the discourses of the\r\npopulace, he published an edict, \"that many illustrious Romans had died\r\nfor the Commonwealth, but none so vehemently lamented: this however was\r\nto the glory of himself and of all men, if a measure were observed. The\r\nsame things which became private families and small states, became not\r\nPrinces and an Imperial People: fresh grief indeed required vent and\r\nease by lamentation; but it was now time to recover and fortify their\r\nminds. Thus the deified Julius, upon the loss of an only daughter; thus\r\nthe deified Augustus, upon the hasty death of his grandsons, had both\r\nvanquished their sorrow. More ancient examples were unnecessary; how\r\noften the Roman People sustained with constancy the slaughter of their\r\narmies, the death of their generals, and entire destruction of their\r\nnoblest families: Princes were mortal; the Commonwealth was eternal:\r\nthey should therefore resume their several vocations.\" And because the\r\nMegalesian games were at hand, he added, \"that they should even apply to\r\nthe usual festivities.\"\r\n\r\nThe vacation ended, public affairs were resumed; Drusus departed for\r\nthe army in Illyricum, and the minds of all men were bent upon seeing\r\nvengeance done upon Piso. They repeated their resentments, that while\r\nhe wandered over the delightful countries of Asia and Greece, he was\r\nstifling, by contumacious and deceitful delays, the evidences of his\r\ncrimes; for it was bruited abroad, that Martina, she who was famous for\r\npoisonings, and sent, as I have above related, by Cneius Sentius towards\r\nRome, was suddenly dead at Brundusium; that poison lay concealed in\r\na knot of her hair, but upon her body were found no symptoms of\r\nself-murder.\r\n\r\nPiso, sending forward his son to Rome, with instructions how to soften\r\nthe Emperor, proceeded himself to Drusus: him he hoped to find less\r\nrigid for the death of a brother, than favourable for the removal of a\r\nrival. Tiberius, to make show of a spirit perfectly unbiassed, received\r\nthe young man graciously, and honoured him with the presents usually\r\nbestowed on young noblemen. The answer of Drusus to Piso was, \"That if\r\nthe current rumours were true, he stood in the first place of grief and\r\nrevenge; but he hoped they were false and chimerical, and that the death\r\nof Germanicus would be pernicious to none.\" This he declared in public,\r\nand avoided all privacy: nor was it doubted but the answer was dictated\r\nby Tiberius; when a youth, otherwise easy and unwary, practised thus the\r\nwiles and cunning of age.\r\n\r\nPiso having crossed the sea of Dalmatia, and left his ships at Ancona,\r\ntook first the road of Picenum and then the Flaminian way, following the\r\nlegion which was going from Pannonia to Rome, and thence to garrison\r\nin Africa. This too became the subject of popular censure, that he\r\nofficiously mixed with the soldiers, and courted them in their march and\r\nquarters: he therefore, to avoid suspicion; or, because when men are\r\nin dread, their conduct wavers, did at Narni embark upon the Nar, and\r\nthence sailed into the Tiber. By landing at the burying-place of the\r\nCaesars, he heightened the wrath of the populace: besides, he and\r\nPlancina came ashore, in open day, in the face of the city who were\r\ncrowding the banks, and proceeded with gay countenances; he attended by\r\na long band of clients, she by a train of ladies. There were yet other\r\nprovocations to hatred; the situation of his house, proudly overlooking\r\nthe Forum, and adorned and illuminated as for a festival; the banquet\r\nand rejoicings held in it, and all as public as the place.\r\n\r\nThe next day Fulcinius Trio arraigned Piso before the Consuls, but\r\nwas opposed by Vitellius, Veranius, and others, who had accompanied\r\nGermanicus: they said, \"that in this prosecution Trio had no part; nor\r\ndid they themselves act as accusers, but only gathered materials, and,\r\nas witnesses, produced the last injunctions of Germanicus.\" Trio dropped\r\nthat accusation; but got leave to call in question his former life: and\r\nnow the Emperor was desired to undertake the trial; a request which the\r\naccused did not at all oppose, dreading the inclinations of the people\r\nand Senate: he knew Tiberius, on the contrary, resolute in despising\r\npopular rumours, and in guilt confederate with his mother: besides that\r\ntruth and misrepresentations were easiest distinguished by a single\r\njudge, but in assemblies odium and envy often prevailed. Tiberius\r\nwas aware of the weight of the trial, and with what reproaches he was\r\nassaulted. Admitting therefore a few confidants, he heard the charge\r\nof the accusers, as also the apology of the accused; and left the cause\r\nentire to the Senate.\r\n\r\nDrusus returned the while from Illyricum; and though the Senate had for\r\nthe reduction of Maroboduus, and other his exploits the summer before,\r\ndecreed him the triumph of ovation; he postponed the honour, and\r\nprivately entered the city. Piso, for his advocates, desired Titus\r\nArruntius, Fulcinius, Asinius Gallus, Eserninus Marcellus, and Sextus\r\nPompeius: but they all framed different excuses; and he had, in their\r\nroom, Marcus Lepidus, Lucius Piso and Liveneius Regulus. Now earnest\r\nwere the expectations of all men, \"how great would prove the fidelity of\r\nthe friends of Germanicus; what the assurance of the criminal, what the\r\nbehaviour of Tiberius; whether he would sufficiently smother, or betray\r\nhis sentiments.\" He never had a more anxious part; neither did the\r\npeople ever indulge themselves in such secret murmurs against their\r\nEmperor, nor harbour in silence severer suspicions.\r\n\r\nWhen the Senate met, Tiberius made a speech full of laboured moderation:\r\n\"That Piso had been his father's lieutenant and friend; and lately\r\nappointed by himself, at the direction of the Senate, coadjutor to\r\nGermanicus in administering the affairs of the East: whether he had\r\nthere by contumacy and opposition exasperated the young Prince, and\r\nexulted over his death, or wickedly procured it, they were then to judge\r\nwith minds unprejudiced. For, if he who was the lieutenant of my\r\nson violated the limits of his commission, cast off obedience to his\r\ngeneral, and even rejoiced at his decease and at my affliction; I\r\nwill detest the man, I will banish him from my house, and for domestic\r\ninjuries exert domestic revenge; not the revenge of an Emperor. But for\r\nyou; if his guilt of any man's death whatsoever is discovered, show your\r\njust vengeance, and by it satisfy yourselves, satisfy the children of\r\nGermanicus, and us his father and grandmother. Consider too especially,\r\nwhether he vitiated the discipline and promoted sedition in the army;\r\nwhether he sought to debauch the affections of the soldiers, and to\r\nrecover the province by arms: or whether these allegations are not\r\npublished falsely and with aggravations by the accusers, with whose\r\nover-passionate zeal, I am justly offended: for, whither tended the\r\nstripping the corpse and exposing it to the eyes and examination of the\r\npopulace; with what view was it proclaimed even to foreign nations, that\r\nhis death was the effect of poison; if all this was still doubtful,\r\nand remains yet to be tried? It is true I bewail my son, and shall ever\r\nbewail him: but neither do I hinder the accused to do what in him lies\r\nto manifest his innocence, even at the expense of Germanicus, if aught\r\nblamable was in him. From you I entreat the same impartiality: let not\r\nthe connection of my sorrow with this cause, mislead you to take crimes\r\nfor proved because they are imputed. For Piso; if the tenderness of\r\nkinsmen, if the faith of friends, has furnished him with patrons, let\r\nthem aid him in his peril, show their utmost eloquence, and exert their\r\nbest diligence. To the same pains, to the same firmness I exhort the\r\naccusers. Thus much we will grant to the memory of Germanicus, that the\r\ninquest concerning his death, be held rather here than in the Forum, in\r\nthe Senate than the common Tribunals. In all the rest, we will descend\r\nto the ordinary methods. Let no man in this cause consider Drusus's\r\ntears; let none regard my sorrow, no more than the probable fictions of\r\ncalumny against us.\"\r\n\r\nTwo days were then appointed for maintaining the charge; six for\r\npreparing the defence, and three for making it. Fulcinius began with\r\nthings stale and impertinent, about the ambition and rapine of Piso in\r\nhis administration of Spain: things which, though proved, brought him\r\nunder no penalty, if acquitted of the present charge; nor, though he\r\nhad been cleared of former faults, could he escape the load of greater\r\nenormities. After him Servaeus, Veranius, and Vitellius, all with equal\r\nzeal, but Vitellius with great eloquence urged \"that Piso, in hatred to\r\nGermanicus, and passionate for innovations, had by tolerating general\r\nlicentiousness, and the oppression of the allies, corrupted the common\r\nsoldiers to that degree, that by the most profligate he was styled\r\n_Father of the Legions_: he had, on the contrary, been outrageous to the\r\nbest men, above all to the friends and companions of Germanicus; and, at\r\nlast, by witchcraft and poison destroyed Germanicus himself: hence the\r\ninfernal charms and immolations practised by him and Plancina: he had\r\nthen attacked the Commonwealth with open arms; and, before he could be\r\nbrought to be tried, they were forced to fight and defeat him.\"\r\n\r\nIn every article but one his defence was faltering. For, neither his\r\ndangerous intrigues in debauching the soldiery, nor his abandoning the\r\nprovince to the most profligate and rapacious, nor even his insults to\r\nGermanicus, were to be denied. He seemed only to wipe off the charge of\r\npoison; a charge which in truth was not sufficiently corroborated by the\r\naccusers, since they had only to allege, \"that at an entertainment of\r\nGermanicus, Piso, while he sat above him, with his hands poisoned the\r\nmeat.\" It appeared absurd that amongst so many attending slaves besides\r\nhis own, in so great a presence, and under the eye of Germanicus, he\r\nwould attempt it: he himself required that the waiters might be\r\nracked, and offered to the rack his own domestics: but the Judges were\r\nimplacable, implacable from different motives; Tiberius for the war\r\nraised in the province; and the Senate could never be convinced that\r\nthe death of Germanicus was not the effect of fraud. Some moved for the\r\nletters written to Piso from Rome; a motion opposed by Tiberius no less\r\nthan by Piso. From without, at the same time, were heard the cries of\r\nthe people, \"that if he escaped the judgment of the Senate, they would\r\nwith their own hands destroy him.\" They had already dragged his statues\r\nto the place from whence malefactors were precipitated, and there\r\nhad broken them; but by the orders of Tiberius they were rescued and\r\nreplaced. Piso was put into a litter and carried back by a tribune of\r\na Praetorian cohort; an attendance variously understood, whether as a\r\nguard for his safety, or a minister of death.\r\n\r\nPlancina was under equal public hatred, but had more secret favour:\r\nhence it was doubted how far Tiberius durst proceed against her. For\r\nherself; while her husband's hopes were yet plausible, she professed\r\n\"she would accompany his fortune, whatever it were, and, if he fell,\r\nfall with him.\" But when by the secret solicitations of Livia, she had\r\nsecured her own pardon, she began by degrees to drop her husband, and to\r\nmake a separate defence. After this fatal warning, he doubted whether\r\nhe should make any further efforts; but, by the advice of his sons,\r\nfortifying his mind, he again entered the Senate: there he found the\r\nprosecution renewed, suffered the declared indignation of the Fathers,\r\nand saw all things cross and terrible; but nothing so much daunted\r\nhim as to behold Tiberius, without mercy, without wrath, close, dark,\r\nunmovable, and bent against every access of tenderness. When he was\r\nbrought home, as if he were preparing for his further defence the next\r\nday, he wrote somewhat, which he sealed and delivered to his freedman:\r\nhe then washed and anointed, and took the usual care of his person. Late\r\nin the night, his wife leaving the chamber, he ordered the door to be\r\nshut; and was found, at break of day, with his throat cut, his sword\r\nlying by him.\r\n\r\nI remember to have heard from ancient men, that in the hands of Piso\r\nwas frequently seen a bundle of writings, which he did not expose, but\r\nwhich, as his friends constantly averred, \"contained the letters of\r\nTiberius and his cruel orders towards Germanicus: that he resolved to\r\nlay them before the Fathers and to charge the Emperor, but was deluded\r\nby the hollow promises of Sejanus: and that neither did Piso die by his\r\nown hands, but by those of an express and private executioner.\" I dare\r\naffirm neither; nor yet ought I to conceal the relations of such\r\nas still lived when I was a youth. Tiberius, with an assumed air of\r\nsadness, complained to the Senate, that Piso, by that sort of death,\r\nhad aimed to load him with obloquy; and asked many questions how he had\r\npassed his last day, how his last night? The freedman answered to most\r\nwith prudence, to some in confusion. The Emperor then recited the letter\r\nsent him by Piso. It was conceived almost in these words: \"Oppressed by\r\na combination of my enemies and the imputation of false crimes; since\r\nno place is left here to truth and my innocence; to the Immortal Gods I\r\nappeal, that towards you, Caesar, I have lived with sincere faith,\r\nnor towards your mother with less reverence. For my sons I implore her\r\nprotection and yours: my son Cneius had no share in my late management\r\nwhatever it were, since, all the while, he abode at Rome: and my son\r\nMarcus dissuaded me from returning to Syria. Oh that, old as I am, I\r\nhad yielded to him, rather than he, young as he is, to me! Hence\r\nmore passionately I pray that innocent as he is, he suffer not in the\r\npunishment of my guilt: by a series of services for five-and-forty\r\nyears, I entreat you; by our former fellowship in the consulship; by the\r\nmemory of the deified Augustus, your father; by his friendship to me; by\r\nmine to you, I entreat you for the life and fortune of my unhappy son.\r\nIt is the last request I shall ever make you.\" Of Plancina he said\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nTiberius, upon this, cleared the young man of any crime as to the\r\ncivil war: he alleged \"the orders of his father, which a son could not\r\ndisobey.\" He likewise bewailed \"that noble house, and even the grievous\r\nlot of Piso himself, however deserved,\" For Plancina he pleaded with\r\nshame and guilt, alleging the importunity of his mother; against whom\r\nmore particularly the secret murmurs of the best people waxed bitter and\r\npoignant. \"Was it then the tender part of a grandmother to admit to her\r\nsight the murderess of her grandson, to be intimate with her, and to\r\nsnatch her from the vengeance of the Senate? To Germanicus alone was\r\ndenied what by the laws was granted to every citizen. By Vitellius\r\nand Veranius, the cause of that prince was mourned and pleaded: by the\r\nEmperor and his mother, Plancina was defended and protected. Henceforth\r\nshe might pursue her infernal arts so successfully tried, repeat\r\nher poisonings, and by her arts and poisons assail Agrippina and her\r\nchildren; and, with the blood of that most miserable house, satiate the\r\nworthy grandmother and uncle.\" In this mock trial two days were wasted;\r\nTiberius, all the while, animating the sons of Piso to defend their\r\nmother: when the pleaders and witnesses had vigorously pushed the\r\ncharge, and no reply was made, commiseration prevailed over hatred. The\r\nConsul Aurelius Cotta was first asked his opinion: for, when the Emperor\r\ncollected the voices, the magistrates likewise voted. Cotta's sentence\r\nwas, \"that the name of Piso should be razed from the annals, part of\r\nhis estate forfeited, part granted to his son Cneius, upon changing that\r\nname; his son Marcus be divested of his dignity, and content with fifty\r\nthousand great sestertia, [Footnote: £42,000.] be banished for ten\r\nyears: and to Plancina, at the request of Livia, indemnity should be\r\ngranted.\"\r\n\r\nMuch of this sentence was abated by the Emperor; particularly that of\r\nstriking Piso's name out of the annals, when \"that of Marc Anthony, who\r\nmade war upon his country; that of Julius Antonius, who had by adultery\r\nviolated the house of Augustus, continued still there.\" He also exempted\r\nMarcus Piso from the ignominy of degradation, and left him his whole\r\npaternal inheritance; for, as I have already often observed, he was to\r\nthe temptations of money incorruptible, and from the shame of having\r\nacquitted Plancina, rendered then more than usually mild. He likewise\r\nwithstood the motion of Valerius Messalinus, \"for erecting a golden\r\nstatue in the Temple of Mars the Avenger;\" and that of Caecina Severus,\r\n\"for founding an altar to revenge.\" \"Such monuments as these,\" he\r\nargued, \"were only fit to be raised upon foreign victories; domestic\r\nevils were to be buried in sadness.\" Messalinus had added, \"that to\r\nTiberius, Livia, Antonia, Agrippina and Drusus, public thanks were to be\r\nrendered for having revenged the death of Germanicus;\" but had omitted\r\nto mention Claudius. Messalinus was asked by Lucius Asprenas, in the\r\npresence of the Senate, \"Whether by design he had omitted him?\" and then\r\nat last the name of Claudius was subjoined. To me, the more I revolve\r\nthe events of late or of old, the more of mockery and slipperiness\r\nappears in all human wisdom and the transactions of men: for, in popular\r\nfame, in the hopes, wishes and veneration of the public, all men were\r\nrather destined to the Empire, than he for whom fortune then reserved\r\nthe sovereignty in the dark.\r\n\r\nA few days after, Vitellius, Veranius and Servaeus, were by the Senate\r\npreferred to the honours of the Priesthood, at the motion of Tiberius.\r\nTo Fulcinius he promised his interest and suffrage towards preferment,\r\nbut advised him \"not to embarrass his eloquence by impetuosity.\" This\r\nwas the end of revenging the death of Germanicus; an affair ambiguously\r\nrelated, not by those only who then lived and interested themselves in\r\nit, but likewise the following times: so dark and intricate are all\r\nthe highest transactions; while some hold for certain facts, the most\r\nprecarious hearsays; others turn facts into falsehood; and both are\r\nswallowed and improved by the credulity of posterity. Drusus went now\r\nwithout the city, there to renew the ceremony of the auspices, and\r\npresently re-entered in the triumph of _ovation_. A few days after died\r\nVipsania his mother; of all the children of Agrippa, the only one who\r\nmade a pacific end: the rest manifestly perished, or are believed to\r\nhave perished, by the sword, poison, or famine.\r\n\r\nThe qualifying of the Law Papia Poppaea was afterwards proposed; a law\r\nwhich, to enforce those of Julius Caesar, Augustus had made when he was\r\nold, for punishing celibacy and enriching the Exchequer. Nor even by\r\nthis means had marriages and children multiplied, while a passion to\r\nlive single and childless prevailed: but, in the meantime, the numbers\r\nthreatened and in danger by it increased daily, while by the glosses and\r\nchicane of the impleaders every family was undone. So that, as before\r\nthe city laboured under the weight of crimes, so now under the pest of\r\nlaws. From this thought I am led backwards to the first rise of laws,\r\nand to open the steps and causes by which we are arrived to the present\r\nnumber and excess; a number infinite and perplexed.\r\n\r\nThe first race of men, free as yet from every depraved passion, lived\r\nwithout guile and crimes, and therefore without chastisements or\r\nrestraints; nor was there occasion for rewards, when of their own accord\r\nthey pursued righteousness: and as they courted nothing contrary to\r\njustice, they were debarred from nothing by terrors. But, after they\r\nhad abandoned their original equality, and from modesty and shame to do\r\nevil, proceeded to ambition and violence; lordly dominion was introduced\r\nand arbitrary rule, and in many nations grew perpetual. Some, either\r\nfrom the beginning, or after they were surfeited with kings, preferred\r\nthe sovereignty of laws; which, agreeable to the artless minds of men,\r\nwere at first short and simple. The laws in most renown were those\r\nframed for the Cretans by Minos; for the Spartans by Lycurgus; and\r\nafterwards such as Solon delivered to the Athenians, now greater\r\nin number and more exquisitely composed. To the Romans justice was\r\nadministered by Romulus according to his pleasure: after him,\r\nNuma managed the people by religious devices and laws divine. Some\r\ninstitutions were made by Tullus Hostilius, some by Ancus Martius; but\r\nabove all our laws were those founded by Servius Tullius; they were such\r\nas even our kings were bound to obey.\r\n\r\nUpon the expulsion of Tarquin; the people, for the security of their\r\nfreedom against the encroachment and factions of the Senate, and for\r\nbinding the public concord, prepared many ordinances: hence were created\r\nthe Decemviri, and by them were composed the twelve tables, out of a\r\ncollection of the most excellent institutions found abroad. The period\r\nthis of all upright and impartial laws. What laws followed, though\r\nsometimes made against crimes and offenders, were yet chiefly made by\r\nviolence, through the animosity of the two Estates, and for seizing\r\nunjustly withholden offices or continuing unjustly in them, or for\r\nbanishing illustrious patriots, and to other wicked ends. Hence the\r\nGracchi and Saturnini, inflamers of the people; and hence Drusus vying,\r\non behalf of the Senate, in popular concessions with these inflamers;\r\nand hence the corrupt promises made to our Italian allies, promises\r\ndeceitfully made, or, by the interposition of some Tribune, defeated.\r\nNeither during the war of Italy, nor during the civil war, was the\r\nmaking of regulations discontinued; many and contradictory were even\r\nthen made. At last Sylla the Dictator, changing or abolishing the past,\r\nadded many of his own, and procured some respite in this matter, but\r\nnot long; for presently followed the turbulent pursuits and proposals of\r\nLepidus, and soon after were the Tribunes restored to their licentious\r\nauthority of throwing the people into combustions at pleasure. And\r\nnow laws were not made for the public only, but for particular men\r\nparticular laws; and corruption abounding in the Commonwealth, the\r\nCommonwealth abounded in laws.\r\n\r\nPompey was, now in his third Consulship, chosen to correct the public\r\nenormities; and his remedies proved to the State more grievous than its\r\ndistempers. He made laws such as suited his ambition, and broke them\r\nwhen they thwarted his will; and lost by arms the regulations which by\r\narms he had procured. Henceforward for twenty years discord raged, and\r\nthere was neither law nor settlement; the most wicked found impunity\r\nin the excess of their wickedness; and many virtuous men, in their\r\nuprightness met destruction. At length, Augustus Caesar in his sixth\r\nConsulship, then confirmed in power without a rival, abolished the\r\norders which during the Triumvirate he had established, and gave us laws\r\nproper for peace and a single ruler. These laws had sanctions severer\r\nthan any heretofore known: as their guardians, informers were appointed,\r\nwho by the Law Papia Poppaea were encouraged with rewards, to watch\r\nsuch as neglected the privileges annexed to marriage and fatherhood, and\r\nconsequently could claim no legacy or inheritance, the same, as vacant,\r\nbelonging to the Roman People, who were the public parent. But these\r\ninformers struck much deeper: by them the whole city, all Italy, and\r\nthe Roman citizens in every part of the Empire, were infested and\r\npersecuted: numbers were stripped of their entire fortunes, and terror\r\nhad seized all; when Tiberius, for a check to this evil, chose twenty\r\nnoblemen, five who were formerly Consuls, five who were formerly\r\nPraetors, with ten other Senators, to review that law. By them many of\r\nits intricacies were explained, its strictness qualified; and hence some\r\npresent alleviation was yielded.\r\n\r\nTiberius about this time, to the Senate recommended Nero, one of the\r\nsons of Germanicus, now seventeen years of age, and desired \"that\r\nhe might be exempted from executing the office of the Vigintivirate,\r\n[Footnote: Officers for distributing the public lands; for regulating\r\nthe mint, the roads, and the execution of criminals.] and have leave to\r\nsue for the Quaestorship five years sooner than the laws directed.\"\r\nA piece of mockery, this request to all who heard it: but, Tiberius\r\npretended \"that the same concessions had been decreed to himself and his\r\nbrother Drusus, at the request of Augustus.\" Nor do I doubt, but there\r\nwere then such who secretly ridiculed that sort of petitions from\r\nAugustus: such policy was however natural to that Prince, while he was\r\nbut yet laying the foundations of the Imperial power, and while the\r\nRepublic and its late laws were still fresh in the minds of men:\r\nbesides, the relation was lighter between Augustus and his wife's\r\nsons, than between a grandfather and his grandsons. To the grant of the\r\nQuaestorship was added a seat in the College of Pontiffs; and the first\r\nday he entered the Forum in his manly robe, a donative of corn and\r\nmoney was distributed to the populace, who exulted to behold a son of\r\nGermanicus now of age. Their joy was soon heightened by his marriage\r\nwith Julia, the daughter of Drusus. But as these transactions were\r\nattended with public applauses; so the intended marriage of the\r\ndaughter of Sejanus with the son of Claudius was received with popular\r\nindignation. By this alliance the nobility of the Claudian house seemed\r\nstained; and by it Sejanus, already suspected of aspiring views, was\r\nlifted still higher.\r\n\r\nAt the end of this year died Lucius Volusius and Sallustius Crispus;\r\ngreat and eminent men. The family of Volusius was ancient, but, in the\r\nexercise of public offices, rose never higher than the Praetorship; it\r\nwas he, who honoured it with the Consulship: he was likewise created\r\nCensor for modelling the classes of the equestrian order; and first\r\naccumulated the wealth which gave that family such immense grandeur.\r\nCrispus was born of an equestrian house, great nephew by a sister to\r\nCaius Sallustius, the renowned Roman historian, and by him adopted: the\r\nway to the great offices was open to him; but, in imitation of Maecenas,\r\nhe lived without the dignity of Senator, yet outwent in power many who\r\nwere distinguished with Consulships and triumphs: his manner of living,\r\nhis dress and daintiness were different from the ways of antiquity; and,\r\nin expense and affluence, he bordered rather upon luxury. He possessed\r\nhowever a vigour of spirit equal to great affairs, and exerted the\r\ngreater promptness for that he hid it in a show of indolence and\r\nsloth: he was therefore, in the time of Maecenas, the next in favour,\r\nafterwards chief confidant in all the secret counsels of Augustus and\r\nTiberius, and privy and consenting to the order for slaying Agrippa\r\nPosthumus. In his old age he preserved with the Prince rather the\r\noutside than the vitals of authority: the same had happened to Maecenas.\r\nIt is the fate of power, which is rarely perpetual; perhaps from satiety\r\non both sides, when Princes have no more to grant, and Ministers no more\r\nto crave.\r\n\r\nNext followed the Consulship of Tiberius and Drusus; to Tiberius the\r\nfourth, to Drusus the second: a Consulship remarkable, for that in it\r\nthe father and son were colleagues. There was indeed the same fellowship\r\nbetween Tiberius and Germanicus, two years before; but besides the\r\ndistastes of jealousy in the uncle, the ties of blood were not so near.\r\nIn the beginning of the year, Tiberius, on pretence of his health,\r\nretired to Campania; either already meditating a long and perpetual\r\nretirement; or to leave to Drusus, in his father's absence, the honour\r\nof executing the Consulship alone: and there happened a thing which,\r\nsmall in itself, yet as it produced mighty contestation, furnished\r\nthe young Consul with matter of popular affection. Domitius Corbulo,\r\nformerly Praetor, complained to the Senate of Lucius Sylla, a noble\r\nyouth, \"that in the show of gladiators, Sylla would not yield him\r\nplace.\" Age, domestic custom, and the ancient men were for Corbulo: on\r\nthe other side, Mamercus Scaurus, Lucius Arruntius, and others laboured\r\nfor their kinsman Sylla: warm speeches were made, and the examples\r\nof our ancestors were urged, \"who by severe decrees had censured\r\nand restrained the irreverence of the youth.\" Drusus interposed with\r\narguments proper for calming animosities, and Corbulo had satisfaction\r\nmade him by Scaurus, who was to Sylla both father-in-law and uncle,\r\nand the most copious orator of that age. The same Corbulo, exclaiming\r\nagainst \"the condition of most of the roads through Italy, that through\r\nthe fraud of the undertakers and negligence of the overseers, they were\r\nbroken and unpassable;\" undertook of his own accord the cure of that\r\nabuse; an undertaking which he executed not so much to the advantage\r\nof the public as to the ruin of many private men in their fortunes and\r\nreputation, by his violent mulcts and unjust judgments and forfeitures.\r\n\r\nUpon this occasion Caecina Severus proposed, \"that no magistrate should\r\ngo into any province accompanied by his wife.\" He introduced this motion\r\nwith a long preface, \"that he lived with his own in perfect concord,\r\nby her he had six children; and what he offered to the public he had\r\npractised himself, having during forty years' service left her still\r\nbehind him, confined to Italy. It was not indeed, without cause,\r\nestablished of old, that women should neither be carried by their\r\nhusbands into confederate nations nor foreign. A train of women\r\nintroduced luxury in peace, by their fears retarded war, and made a\r\nRoman army resemble, in their march, a mixed host of barbarians. The\r\nsex was not tender only and unfit for travel, but, if suffered, cruel,\r\naspiring, and greedy of authority: they even marched amongst the\r\nsoldiers, and were obeyed by the officers. A woman had lately presided\r\nat the exercises of the troops, and at the decursions of the legions.\r\nThe Senate themselves might remember, that as often as any of the\r\nmagistrates were charged with plundering the provinces, their wives were\r\nalways engaged in the guilt. To the ladies, the most profligate in\r\nthe province applied; by them all affairs were undertaken, by them\r\ntransacted: at home two distinct courts were kept, and abroad the wife\r\nhad her distinct train and attendance. The ladies, too, issued distinct\r\norders, but more imperious and better obeyed. Such feminine excesses\r\nwere formerly restrained by the Oppian, and other laws; but now these\r\nrestraints were violated, women ruled all things, their families, the\r\nForum, and even the armies.\"\r\n\r\nThis speech was heard by few with approbation, and many proclaimed\r\ntheir dissent; \"for, that neither was that the point in debate, nor was\r\nCaecina considerable enough to censure so weighty an affair.\" He was\r\npresently answered by Valerius Messalinus, who was the son of Messala,\r\nand inherited a sparkling of his father's eloquence: \"that many rigorous\r\ninstitutions of the ancients were softened and changed for the better:\r\nfor, neither was Rome now, as of old, beset with wars, nor Italy with\r\nhostile provinces; and a few concessions were made to the conveniences\r\nof women, who were so far from burdening the provinces, that to their\r\nown husbands there they were no burden. As to honours, attendance and\r\nexpense, they enjoyed them in common with their husbands, who could\r\nreceive no embarrassment from their company in time of peace. To war\r\nindeed we must go equipped and unencumbered; but after the fatigues of\r\nwar, what was more allowable than the consolations of a wife? But it\r\nseemed the wives of some magistrates had given a loose to ambition and\r\navarice. And were the magistrates themselves free from these excesses?\r\nwere not most of them governed by many exorbitant appetites? did we\r\ntherefore send none into the provinces? It was added, that the husbands\r\nwere corrupted by their corrupt wives: and were therefore all single\r\nmen uncorrupt? The Oppian Laws were once thought necessary, because the\r\nexigencies of the State required their severity: they were afterwards\r\nrelaxed and mollified, because that too was expedient for the State.\r\nIn vain we covered our own sloth with borrowed names: if the wife broke\r\nbounds, the husband ought to bear the blame. It was moreover unjustly\r\njudged, for the weak and uxorious spirit of one or a few, to bereave all\r\nothers of the fellowship of their wives, the natural partners of their\r\nprosperity and distress. Besides, the sex, weak by nature, would be left\r\ndefenceless, exposed to the luxurious bent of their native passions,\r\nand a prey to the allurements of adulterers: scarce under the eye and\r\nrestraint of the husband was the marriage bed preserved inviolate: what\r\nmust be the consequence, when by an absence of many years, the ties\r\nof marriage would be forgot, forgot as it were in a divorce? It became\r\nthem, therefore, so to cure the evils abroad as not to forget the\r\nenormities at Rome.\" To this Drusus added somewhat concerning his own\r\nwedlock. \"Princes,\" he said, \"were frequently obliged to visit the\r\nremote parts of the Empire: how often did the deified Augustus travel\r\nto the East, how often to the West, still accompanied with Livia?\r\nHe himself too had taken a progress to Illyricum, and, if it were\r\nexpedient, was ready to visit other nations; but not always with an easy\r\nspirit, if he were to be torn from his dear wife, her by whom he had so\r\nmany children.\" Thus was Caecina's motion eluded.\r\n\r\nWhen the Senate met next, they had a letter from Tiberius. In it he\r\naffected to chide the fathers, \"that upon him they cast all public\r\ncares;\" and named them M. Lepidus and Junius Blesus, to choose\r\neither for Proconsul of Africa. They were then both heard as to this\r\nnomination: Lepidus excused himself with earnestness; he pleaded \"his\r\nbodily frailty, the tender age of his children, and a daughter fit for\r\nmarriage.\" There was another reason too, of which he said nothing; but\r\nit was easily understood: Blesus was uncle to Sejanus, and therefore\r\nhad the prevailing interest. Blesus too made a show of refusing, but\r\nnot with the like positiveness, and was heard with partiality by the\r\nflatterers of power.\r\n\r\nThe same year the cities of Gaul, stimulated by their excessive debts,\r\nbegan a rebellion. The most vehement incendiaries were Julius Florus and\r\nJulius Sacrovir; the first amongst those of Treves, the second amongst\r\nthe Aeduans. They were both distinguished by their nobility, and by the\r\ngood services of their ancestors, who thence had acquired of old the\r\nright of Roman citizens; a privilege rare in those days, and then only\r\nthe prize of virtue. When by secret meetings, they had gained those\r\nwho were most prompt to rebel; with such as were desperate through\r\nindigence, or, from guilt of past crimes, forced to commit more; they\r\nagreed that Florus should begin the insurrection in Belgia; Sacrovir\r\namongst the neighbouring Gauls. In order to this, they had many\r\nconsultations and cabals, where they uttered seditious harangues; they\r\nurged \"their tribute without end, their devouring usury, the pride and\r\ncruelty of their Governors: that they had now a glorious opportunity\r\nto recover their liberty; for that since the report of the murder\r\nof Germanicus, discord had seized the Roman soldiery: they need only\r\nconsider their own strength and numbers; while Italy was poor and\r\nexhausted; the Roman populace weak and unwarlike, the Roman armies\r\ndestitute of all vigour but that derived from foreigners.\"\r\n\r\nScarce one city remained untainted with the seeds of this rebellion; but\r\nit first broke at Angiers and Tours. The former were reduced by Acilius\r\nAviola, a legate, with the assistance of a cohort drawn from the\r\ngarrison at Lyons. Those of Tours were suppressed by the same Aviola,\r\nassisted with a detachment sent from the legions, by Visellius Varro,\r\nlieutenant-governor of lower Germany. Some of the chiefs of the Gauls\r\nhad likewise joined him with succours, the better to disguise their\r\ndefection, and to push it with more effect hereafter. Even Sacrovir\r\nwas beheld engaged in fight for the Romans, with his head bare, a\r\n_demonstration_, he pretended, _of his bravery_; but the prisoners\r\naverred, that \"he did it to be known to his countrymen, and to escape\r\ntheir darts.\"\r\n\r\nAn account of all this was laid before Tiberius, who slighted it, and\r\nby hesitation fostered the war. Florus the while pushed his designs, and\r\ntried to debauch a regiment of horse, levied at Treves, and kept under\r\nour pay and discipline: he would have engaged them to begin the war, by\r\nputting to the sword the Roman merchants; and some few were corrupted,\r\nbut the body remained in their allegiance. A rabble however, of his own\r\nfollowers and desperate debtors, took arms and were making to the forest\r\nof Arden, when the legions sent from both armies by Visellius and Caius\r\nSilius, through different routes to intercept them, marred their march:\r\nand Julius Indus, one of the same country with Florus, at enmity with\r\nhim, and therefore more eager to engage him, was despatched forward with\r\na chosen band, and broke the ill-appointed multitude. Florus by lurking\r\nfrom place to place, frustrated the search of the conquerors: but at\r\nlast, when he saw all the passes beset with soldiers, he fell by his own\r\nhands. This was the issue of the insurrection at Treves.\r\n\r\nAmongst the Aeduans the revolt was stronger, as much stronger as the\r\nstate was more opulent; and the forces to suppress it were to be brought\r\nfrom afar. Augustodunum, [Footnote: Autun.] the capital of the nation,\r\nwas seized by Sacrovir, and in it all the noble youth of Gaul, who were\r\nthere instructed in the liberal arts. By securing these pledges he aimed\r\nto bind in his interest their parents and relations; and at the same\r\ntime distributed to the young men the arms, which he had caused to be\r\nsecretly made. He had forty thousand men, the fifth part armed like\r\nour legions, the rest with poles, hangers, and other weapons used\r\nby hunters. To the number were added such of the slaves as had been\r\nappointed to be gladiators; these were covered, after the fashion of the\r\ncountry, with a continued armour of iron; and styled _Crupellarii_;\r\na sort of militia unwieldy at exercising their own weapons, and\r\nimpenetrable by those of others. These forces were still increased by\r\nvolunteers from the neighbouring cities, where, though the public\r\nbody did not hitherto avow the revolt, yet the zeal of particulars was\r\nmanifest: they had likewise leisure to increase from the contention of\r\nthe two Roman generals; a contention for some time undecided, while\r\neach demanded the command in that war. At length Varro, old and infirm,\r\nyielded to the superior vigour of Silius.\r\n\r\nNow at Rome, \"not only the insurrection of Treves and of the Aeduans,\r\nbut likewise, that threescore and four cities of Gaul had revolted; that\r\nthe Germans had joined in the revolt, and that Spain fluctuated;\" were\r\nreports all believed with the usual aggravations of fame. The best men\r\ngrieved in sympathy for their country: many from hatred of the present\r\ngovernment and thirst of change, rejoiced in their own perils: they\r\ninveighed against Tiberius, \"that in such a mighty uproar of rebellion,\r\nhe was only employed in perusing the informations of the State\r\naccusers.\" They asked, \"did he mean to surrender Julius Sacrovir to the\r\nSenate, to try him for treason?\" They exulted, \"that there were at last\r\nfound men, who would with arms restrain his bloody orders for private\r\nmurders.\" And declared \"that even war was a happy change for a most\r\nwretched peace.\" So much the more for this, Tiberius affected to appear\r\nwrapped up in security and unconcern; he neither changed place nor\r\ncountenance, but behaved himself at that time as at other times; whether\r\nfrom elevation of mind, or whether he had learned that the state of\r\nthings was not alarming, and only heightened by vulgar representation.\r\n\r\nSilius the while sending forward a band of auxiliaries, marched with two\r\nlegions, and in his march ravaged the villages of the Sequanians,\r\nnext neighbours to the Aeduans, and their associates in arms. He then\r\nadvanced towards Augustodunum; a hasty march, the standard-bearers\r\nmutually vying in expedition, and the common men breathing ardour and\r\neagerness: they desired, \"that no time might be wasted in the usual\r\nrefreshments, none of their nights in sleep; let them only see and\r\nconfront the foe: they wanted no more, to be victorious.\" Twelve miles\r\nfrom Augustodunum, Sacrovir appeared with his forces upon the plains:\r\nin the front he had placed the iron troop; his cohorts in the wings; the\r\nhalf-armed in the rear: he himself, upon a fine horse, attended by the\r\nother chiefs, addressed himself to them from rank to rank; he reminded\r\nthem \"of the glorious achievements of the ancient Gauls; of the\r\nvictorious mischiefs they had brought upon the Romans; of the liberty\r\nand renown attending victory; of their redoubled and intolerable\r\nservitude, if once more vanquished.\"\r\n\r\nA short speech; and an unattentive, and disheartened audience! For, the\r\nembattled legions approached; and the crowd of townsmen, ill appointed\r\nand novices in war, stood astonished, bereft of the present use of eyes\r\nand hearing. On the other side, Silius, though he presumed the victory,\r\nand thence might have spared exhortations, yet called to his men, \"that\r\nthey might be with reason ashamed that they, the conquerors of Germany,\r\nshould be thus led against a rabble of Gauls as against an equal enemy:\r\none cohort had newly defeated the rebels of Tours; one regiment of\r\nhorse, those of Treves; a handful of this very army had routed the\r\nSequanians: the present Aeduans, as they are more abounding in wealth,\r\nas they wallow more in voluptuousness, are by so much more soft and\r\nunwarlike: this is what you are now to prove, and your task to prevent\r\ntheir escape.\" His words were returned with a mighty cry. Instantly the\r\nhorse surrounded the foe; the foot attacked their front, and the wings\r\nwere presently routed: the iron band gave some short obstruction, as\r\nthe bars of their coats withstood the strokes of sword and pike: but the\r\nsoldiers had recourse to their hatchets and pick-axes; and, as if they\r\nhad battered a wall, hewed their bodies and armour: others with clubs,\r\nand some with forks, beat down the helpless lumps, who as they lay\r\nstretched along, without one struggle to rise, were left for dead.\r\nSacrovir fled first to Augustodunum; and thence, fearful of being\r\nsurrendered, to a neighbouring town, accompanied by his most faithful\r\nadherents. There he slew himself; and the rest, one another: having\r\nfirst set the town on fire, by which they were all consumed.\r\n\r\nNow at last Tiberius wrote to the Senate about this war, and at once\r\nacquainted them with its rise and conclusion, neither aggravating facts\r\nnor lessening them; but added \"that it was conducted by the fidelity\r\nand bravery of his lieutenants, guided by his counsels.\" He likewise\r\nassigned the reasons why neither he, nor Drusus, went to that war;\r\n\"that the Empire was an immense body; and it became not the dignity of\r\na Prince, upon the revolt of one or two towns, to desert the capital,\r\nwhence motion was derived to the whole: but since the alarm was over, he\r\nwould visit those nations and settle them.\" The Senate decreed vows\r\nand supplications for his return, with other customary honours.\r\nOnly Cornelius Dolabella, while he strove to outdo others, fell into\r\nridiculous sycophancy, and moved \"that from Campania he should enter\r\nRome in the triumph of ovation.\" This occasioned a letter from Tiberius:\r\nin it he declared, \"he was not so destitute of glory, that after having\r\nin his youth subdued the fiercest nations, and enjoyed or slighted so\r\nmany triumphs, he should now in his old age seek empty honours from a\r\nshort progress about the suburbs of Rome.\"\r\n\r\nCaius Sulpitius and Decimus Haterius were the following Consuls. Their\r\nyear was exempt from disturbances abroad; but at home some severe blow\r\nwas apprehended against luxury, which prevailed monstrously in all\r\nthings that create a profusion of money. But as the more pernicious\r\narticles of expense were covered by concealing their prices; therefore\r\nfrom the excesses of the table, which were become the common subject of\r\ndaily animadversion, apprehensions were raised of some rigid correction\r\nfrom a Prince, who observed himself the ancient parsimony. For, Caius\r\nBibulus having begun the complaint, the other Aediles took it up, and\r\nargued \"that the sumptuary laws were despised; the pomp and expense of\r\nplate and entertainments, in spite of restraints, increased daily,\r\nand by moderate penalties were not to be stopped.\" This grievance thus\r\nrepresented to the Senate, was by them referred entire to the Emperor.\r\nTiberius having long weighed with himself whether such an abandoned\r\npropensity to prodigality could be stemmed; whether the stemming it\r\nwould not bring heavier evils upon the public; how dishonourable it\r\nwould be to attempt what could not be effected, or at least effected by\r\nthe disgrace of the nobility, and by the subjecting illustrious men to\r\ninfamous punishments; wrote at last to the Senate in this manner:\r\n\r\n\"In other matters, Conscript Fathers, perhaps it might be more expedient\r\nfor you to consult me in the Senate; and for me to declare there, what I\r\njudge for the public weal: but in the debate of this affair, it was best\r\nthat my eyes were withdrawn; lest, while you marked the countenances and\r\nterror of particulars charged with scandalous luxury, I too should have\r\nobserved them, and, as it were, caught them in it. Had the vigilant\r\nAediles first asked counsel of me, I know not whether I should not have\r\nadvised them rather to have passed by potent and inveterate corruptions,\r\nthan only make it manifest, what enormities are an overmatch for us:\r\nbut they in truth have done their duty, as I would have all other\r\nmagistrates fulfil theirs. But for myself, it is neither commendable\r\nto be silent; nor does it belong to my station to speak out; since I\r\nneither bear the character of an Aedile, nor of a Praetor, nor of a\r\nConsul: something still greater and higher is required of a Prince.\r\nEvery one is ready to assume to himself the credit of whatever is well\r\ndone, while upon the Prince alone are thrown the miscarriages of all.\r\nBut what is it, that I am first to prohibit, what excess retrench to the\r\nancient standard? Am I to begin with that of our country seats, spacious\r\nwithout bounds; and with the number of domestics, a number distributed\r\ninto nations in private families? or with the quantity of plate, silver,\r\nand gold? or with the pictures, and works, and statues of brass, the\r\nwonders of art? or with the gorgeous vestments, promiscuously worn by\r\nmen and women? or with what is peculiar to the women, those precious\r\nstones, for the purchase of which our corn is carried into foreign and\r\nhostile nations.\r\n\r\n\"I am not ignorant that at entertainments and in conversation, these\r\nexcesses are censured, and a regulation is required: and yet if an equal\r\nlaw were made, if equal penalties were prescribed, these very censurers\r\nwould loudly complain, _that the State was utterly overturned, that\r\nsnares and destruction were prepared for every illustrious house, that\r\nno men could be guiltless, and all men would be the prey of informers_.\r\nAnd yet bodily diseases grown inveterate and strengthened by time,\r\ncannot be checked but by medicines rigid and violent: it is the same\r\nwith the soul: the sick and raging soul, itself corrupted and scattering\r\nits corruption, is not to be qualified but by remedies equally strong\r\nwith its own flaming lusts. So many laws made by our ancestors, so many\r\nadded by the deified Augustus; the former being lost in oblivion, and\r\n(which is more heinous) the latter in contempt, have only served to\r\nrender luxury more secure. When we covet a thing yet unforbid, we are\r\napt to fear that it may be forbid; but when once we can with impunity\r\nand defiance overleap prohibited bounds, there remains afterwards nor\r\nfear nor shame. How therefore did parsimony prevail of old? It was\r\nbecause, every one was a law to himself; it was because we were then\r\nonly masters of one city: nor afterwards, while our dominion was\r\nconfined only to Italy, had we found the same instigations to\r\nvoluptuousness. By foreign conquests, we learned to waste the property\r\nof others; and in the Civil Wars, to consume our own. What a mighty\r\nmatter is it that the Aediles remonstrate! how little to be weighed in\r\nthe balance with others? It is wonderful that nobody represents, that\r\nItaly is in constant want of foreign supplies; that the lives of the\r\nRoman People are daily at the mercy of uncertain seas and of tempests:\r\nwere it not for our supports from the provinces; supports, by which the\r\nmasters, and their slaves, and their estates, are maintained; would\r\nour own groves and villas maintain us? This care therefore, Conscript\r\nFathers, is the business of the Prince; and by the neglect of this\r\ncare, the foundations of the State would be dissolved. The cure of other\r\ndefects depends upon our own private spirits: some of us, shame will\r\nreclaim; necessity will mend the poor; satiety the rich. Or if any of\r\nthe Magistrates, from a confidence of his own firmness and perseverance,\r\nwill undertake to stem the progress of so great an evil; he has both\r\nmy praises, and my acknowledgment, that he discharges me of part of my\r\nfatigues: but if such will only impeach corruptions, and when they have\r\ngained the glory, would leave upon me the indignation (indignation of\r\ntheir own raising); believe me, Conscript Fathers, I am not fond of\r\nbearing resentments: I already suffer many for the Commonwealth; many\r\nthat are grievous and almost all unjust; and therefore with reason I\r\nintreat that I may not be loaded with such as are wantonly and vainly\r\nraised, and promise no advantage to you nor to me.\"\r\n\r\nThe Senate, upon reading the Emperor's letter, released the Aediles\r\nfrom this pursuit: and the luxury of the table which, from the battle\r\nof Actium till the revolution made by Galba, flowed, for the space of an\r\nhundred years, in all profusion; at last gradually declined. The causes\r\nof this change are worth knowing. Formerly the great families, great in\r\nnobility or abounding in riches, were carried away with a passion for\r\nmagnificence: for even then it was allowed to court the good graces of\r\nthe Roman People, with the favour of kings, and confederate nations; and\r\nto be courted by them: so that each was distinguished by the lustre\r\nof popularity and dependances, in proportion to his affluence, the\r\nsplendour of his house, and the figure he made. But after Imperial fury\r\nhad long raged in the slaughter of the Grandees, and the greatness of\r\nreputation was become the sure mark of destruction; the rest grew wiser:\r\nbesides, new men frequently chosen Senators from the municipal towns,\r\nfrom the colonies, and even from the provinces, brought into the Senate\r\ntheir own domestic parsimony; and though, by fortune or industry, many\r\nof them grew wealthy as they grew old, yet their former frugal spirit\r\ncontinued. But above all, Vespasian proved the promoter of thrifty\r\nliving, being himself the pattern of ancient economy in his person\r\nand table: hence the compliance of the public with the manners of the\r\nPrince, and an emulation to practise them; an incitement more prevalent\r\nthan the terrors of laws and all their penalties. Or perhaps all human\r\nthings go a certain round; and, as in the revolutions of time, there are\r\nalso vicissitudes in manners: nor indeed have our ancestors excelled\r\nus in all things; our own age has produced many excellences worthy of\r\npraise and the imitation of posterity. Let us still preserve this strife\r\nin virtue with our forefathers.\r\n\r\nTiberius having gained the fame of moderation; because, by rejecting the\r\nproject for reforming luxury, he had disarmed the growing hopes of the\r\naccusers; wrote to the Senate, to desire the _Tribunitial Power_ for\r\nDrusus. Augustus had devised this title, as best suiting the unbounded\r\nheight of his views; while avoiding the odious name of _King_ or\r\n_Dictator_, he was yet obliged to use some particular appellation,\r\nunder it to control all other powers in the State. He afterwards assumed\r\nMarcus Agrippa into a fellowship in it; and, upon his death, Tiberius;\r\nthat none might doubt, who was to be his successor. By this means, he\r\nconceived, he should defeat the aspiring views of others: besides, he\r\nconfided in the moderation of Tiberius, and in the mightiness of his own\r\nauthority. By his example, Tiberius now advanced Drusus to the supreme\r\nMagistracy; whereas, while Germanicus yet lived, he acted without\r\ndistinction towards both. In the beginning of his letter he besought the\r\nGods \"that by his counsels the Republic might prosper,\" and then added\r\na modest testimony concerning the qualities and behaviour of the young\r\nPrince, without aggravation or false embellishments; \"that he had a wife\r\nand three children, and was of the same age with himself, when called\r\nby the deified Augustus to that office: that Drusus was not now by him\r\nadopted a partner in the toils of government, precipitately; but after\r\neight years' experience made of his qualifications; after seditions\r\nsuppressed, wars concluded, the honour of triumph, and two Consulships.\"\r\n\r\nThe Senators had foreseen this address; hence they received it with the\r\nmore elaborate adulation. However, they could devise nothing to decree,\r\nbut \"statues to the two Princes, altars to the Gods, arches,\" and other\r\nusual honours: only that Marcus Silanus strove to honour the Princes by\r\nthe disgrace of the Consulship: he proposed \"that all records public and\r\nprivate should, for their date, be inscribed no more with the names\r\nof the Consuls, but of those who exercised the Tribunitial power.\" But\r\nHaterius Agrippa, by moving to have \"the decrees of that day engraved\r\nin letters of gold, and hung up in the Senate,\" became an object of\r\nderision; for that, as he was an ancient man, he could reap from his\r\nmost abominable flattery no other fruit but that of infamy.\r\n\r\nTiberius, while he fortified the vitals of his own domination, afforded\r\nthe Senate a shadow of their ancient jurisdiction; by referring to their\r\nexamination petitions and claims from the provinces. For there had now\r\nprevailed amongst the Greek cities a latitude of instituting sanctuaries\r\nat pleasure. Hence the temples were filled with the most profligate\r\nfugitive slaves: here debtors found protection against their creditors;\r\nand hither were admitted such as were pursued for capital crimes. Nor\r\nwas any force of Magistracy or laws sufficient to bridle the mad zeal\r\nof the people, who confounding the sacred villainies of men with\r\nthe worship peculiar to the Gods, seditiously defended these profane\r\nsanctuaries. It was therefore ordered that these cities should send\r\ndeputies to represent their claims. Some of the cities voluntarily\r\nrelinquished the nominal privileges, which they had arbitrarily assumed:\r\nmany confided in their rights; a confidence grounded on the antiquity of\r\ntheir superstitions, or on the merits of their kind offices to the Roman\r\nPeople. Glorious to the Senate was the appearance of that day, when\r\nthe grants from our ancestors, the engagements of our confederates, the\r\nordinances of kings, such kings who had reigned as yet independent of\r\nthe Roman power; and when even the sacred worship of the Gods were now\r\nall subjected to their inspection, and their judgment free, as of old,\r\nto ratify or abolish with absolute power.\r\n\r\nFirst of all the Ephesians applied. They alleged, that \"Diana and Apollo\r\nwere not, according to the credulity of the vulgar, born at Delos: in\r\ntheir territory flowed the river Cenchris; where also stood the Ortygian\r\nGrove: there the big-bellied Latona, leaning upon an olive tree, which\r\neven then remained, was delivered of these deities; and thence by their\r\nappointment the Grove became sacred. Thither Apollo himself, after his\r\nslaughter of the Cyclops, retired for a sanctuary from the wrath of\r\nJupiter: soon after, the victorious Bacchus pardoned the suppliant\r\nAmazons, who sought refuge at the altar of Diana: by the concession of\r\nHercules, when he reigned in Lydia, her temple was dignified with an\r\naugmentation of immunities; nor during the Persian monarchy were they\r\nabridged: they were next maintained by the Macedonians, and then by us.\"\r\n\r\nThe Magnesians next asserted their claim, founded on an establishment\r\nof Lucius Scipio, confirmed by another of Sylla: the former after the\r\ndefeat of Antiochus; the latter after that of Mithridates, having, as\r\na testimony of the faith and bravery of the Magnesians, dignified their\r\ntemple of the Leucophrynaean Diana with the privileges of an inviolable\r\nsanctuary. After them, the Aphrodisians and Stratoniceans produced a\r\ngrant from Caesar the Dictator, for their early services to his party;\r\nand another lately from Augustus, with a commendation inserted,\r\n\"that with zeal unshaken towards the Roman People, they had borne the\r\nirruption of the Parthians.\" But these two people adored different\r\ndeities: Aphrodisium was a city devoted to Venus; that of Stratonicea\r\nmaintained the worship of Jupiter and of Diana Trivia. Those of\r\nHierocaesarea exhibited claims of higher antiquity, \"that they possessed\r\nthe Persian Diana, and her temple consecrated by King Cyrus.\" They\r\nlikewise pleaded the authorities of Perpenna, Isauricus, and of many\r\nmore Roman captains, who had allowed the same sacred immunity not to\r\nthe temple only, but to a precinct two miles round it. Those of Cyprus\r\npleaded right of sanctuary to three of their temples: the most ancient\r\nfounded by Aerias to the Paphian Venus; another by his son Amathus to\r\nthe Amathusian Venus; the third to the Salaminian Jupiter by Teucer, the\r\nson of Telamon, when he fled from the fury of his father.\r\n\r\nThe deputies too of other cities were heard. But the Senate tired with\r\nso many, and because there was a contention begun amongst particular\r\nparties for particular cities; gave power to the Consuls \"to search into\r\nthe validity of their several pretensions, and whether in them no fraud\r\nwas interwoven;\" with orders \"to lay the whole matter once more before\r\nthe Senate.\" The Consuls reported that, besides the cities already\r\nmentioned, \"they had found the temple of AEsculapius at Pergamus to be a\r\ngenuine sanctuary: the rest claimed upon originals, from the darkness of\r\nantiquity, altogether obscure. Smyrna particularly pleaded an oracle\r\nof Apollo, in obedience to which they had dedicated a temple to Venus\r\nStratonices; as did the Isle of Tenos an oracular order from the same\r\nGod, to erect to Neptune a statue and temple. Sardis urged a later\r\nauthority, namely, a grant from the Great Alexander; and Miletus\r\ninsisted on one from King Darius: as to the deities of these two cities;\r\none worshipped Diana; the other, Apollo. And Crete too demanded the\r\nprivilege of sanctuary, to a statue of the deified Augustus.\" Hence\r\ndiverse orders of Senate were made, by which, though great reverence\r\nwas expressed towards the deities, yet the extent of the sanctuaries was\r\nlimited; and the several people were enjoined \"to hang up in each\r\ntemple the present decree engraven in brass, as a sacred memorial, and a\r\nrestraint against their lapsing, under the colour of religion, into the\r\nabuses and claims of superstition.\"\r\n\r\nAt the same time, a vehement distemper having seized Livia, obliged the\r\nEmperor to hasten his return to Rome; seeing hitherto the mother and son\r\nlived in apparent unanimity; or perhaps mutually disguised their hate:\r\nfor, not long before, Livia, having dedicated a statue to the deified\r\nAugustus, near the theatre of Marcellus, had the name of Tiberius\r\ninscribed after her own. This he was believed to have resented\r\nheinously, as a degrading the dignity of the Prince; but to have buried\r\nhis resentment under dark dissimulation. Upon this occasion, therefore,\r\nthe Senate decreed \"supplications to the Gods; with the celebration of\r\nthe greater Roman games, under the direction of the Pontifs, the Augurs,\r\nthe College of Fifteen, assisted by the College of Seven, and the\r\nFraternity of Augustal Priests.\" Lucius Apronius had moved, that \"with\r\nthe rest might preside the company of heralds.\" Tiberius opposed it; he\r\ndistinguished between the jurisdiction of the priests and theirs; \"for\r\nthat at no time had the heralds arrived to so much pre-eminence: but\r\nfor the Augustal Fraternity, they were therefore added, because they\r\nexercised a priesthood peculiar to that family for which the present\r\nvows and solemnities were made,\" It is no part of my purpose to\r\ntrace all the votes of particular men, unless they are memorable for\r\nintegrity, or for notorious infamy: this I conceive to be the principal\r\nduty of an historian, that he suppress no instance of virtue; and that\r\nby the dread of future infamy and the censures of posterity, men may be\r\ndeterred from detestable actions and prostitute speeches. In short,\r\nsuch was the abomination of those times, so prevailing the contagion\r\nof flattery, that not only the first nobles, whose obnoxious splendour\r\nfound protection only in obsequiousness; but all who had been Consuls,\r\na great part of such as had been Praetors, and even many of the\r\nunregistered Senators, strove for priority in the vileness and excess\r\nof their votes. There is a tradition, that Tiberius, as often as he went\r\nout of the Senate, was wont to cry out in Greek, _Oh men prepared for\r\nbondage!_ Yes, even Tiberius, he who could not bear public liberty,\r\nnauseated this prostitute tameness of slaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IV\r\n\r\nA.D. 23-28.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Caius Asinius and Caius Antistius were Consuls, Tiberius was in\r\nhis ninth year; the State composed, and his family flourishing (for the\r\ndeath of Germanicus he reckoned amongst the incidents of his prosperity)\r\nwhen suddenly fortune began to grow boisterous, and he himself to\r\ntyrannise, or to furnish others with the weapons of tyranny. The\r\nbeginning and cause of this turn arose from Aelius Sejanus, captain of\r\nthe Praetorian cohorts. Of his power I have above made mention; I shall\r\nnow explain his original, his manners, and by what black deeds he strove\r\nto snatch the sovereignty. He was born at Vulsinii, son to Sejus Strabo,\r\na Roman knight; in his early youth, he was a follower of Caius Caesar\r\n(grandson of Augustus) and lay then under the contumely of having\r\nfor hire exposed himself to the constupration of Apicius; a debauchee\r\nwealthy and profuse: next by various artifices he so enchanted Tiberius,\r\nthat he who to all others was dark and unsearchable, became to Sejanus\r\nalone destitute of all restraint and caution: nor did he so much\r\naccomplish this by any superior efforts of policy (for at his own\r\nstratagems he was vanquished by others) as by the rage of the Gods\r\nagainst the Roman State, to which he proved alike destructive when he\r\nflourished and when he fell. His person was hardy and equal to fatigues;\r\nhis spirit daring but covered; sedulous to disguise his own counsels,\r\ndexterous to blacken others; alike fawning and imperious; to appearance\r\nexactly modest; but in his heart fostering the lust of domination; and,\r\nwith this view, engaged at one time in profusion, largesses, and luxury;\r\nand again, often laid out in application and vigilance; qualities\r\nno less pernicious, when personated by ambition for the acquiring of\r\nEmpire.\r\n\r\nThe authority of his command over the guards, which was but moderate\r\nbefore his time, he extended, by gathering into one camp all the\r\nPraetorian cohorts then dispersed over the city; that thus united, they\r\nmight all at once receive his orders, and by continually beholding their\r\nown numbers and strength, conceive confidence in themselves and prove\r\na terror to all other men. He pretended, \"that the soldiers, while they\r\nlived scattered, lived loose and debauched; that when gathered into a\r\nbody, there could, in any hasty emergency, be more reliance upon their\r\nsuccour; and that when encamped, remote from the allurements of the\r\ntown, they would in their discipline be more exact and severe.\" When the\r\nencampment was finished, he began gradually to allure the affections of\r\nthe soldiers, by all the ways of affability, court, and familiarity: it\r\nwas he too who chose the Centurions, he who chose the Tribunes.\r\nNeither in his pursuits of ambition did the Senate escape him; but\r\nby distinguishing his followers in it with offices and provinces,\r\nhe cultivated power and a party there: for, to all this Tiberius\r\nwas entirely resigned; and even so passionate for him, that not in\r\nconversation only, but in public, in his speeches to the Senate and\r\npeople, he treated and extolled him, as _the sharer of his burdens_;\r\nnay, allowed his effigies to be publicly adored, in the several\r\ntheatres, in all places of popular convention, and even amongst the\r\nEagles of the legions.\r\n\r\nBut to his designs were many retardments: the Imperial house was full\r\nof Caesars; the Emperor's son a grown man, and his grandsons of age: and\r\nbecause the cutting them off all at once, was dangerous; the treason he\r\nmeditated, required a gradation of murders. He however chose the darkest\r\nmethod, and to begin with Drusus; against whom he was transported with\r\na fresh motive of rage. For, Drusus impatient of a rival, and in his\r\ntemper inflammable, had upon some occasional contest, shaken his fist at\r\nSejanus, and, as he prepared to resist, given him a blow on the face.\r\nAs he therefore cast about for every expedient of revenge, the readiest\r\nseemed to apply to Livia his wife: she was the sister of Germanicus, and\r\nfrom an uncomely person in her childhood, grew afterwards to excel in\r\nloveliness. As his passion for this lady was vehement, he tempted her to\r\nadultery, and having fulfilled the first iniquity (nor will a woman, who\r\nhas sacrificed her chastity, stick at any other) he carried her greater\r\nlengths, to the views of marriage, a partnership in the Empire, and\r\neven the murder of her husband. Thus she, the niece of Augustus, the\r\ndaughter-in-law of Tiberius, the mother of children by Drusus, defiled\r\nherself, her ancestors, and her posterity, with a municipal adulterer;\r\nand all to exchange an honourable condition possessed, for pursuits\r\nflagitious and uncertain. Into a fellowship in the guilt was assumed\r\nEudemus, physician to Livia; and, under colour of his profession,\r\nfrequently with her in private. Sejanus too, to avoid the jealousy of\r\nthe adulteress, discharged from his bed Apicata his wife, her by whom he\r\nhad three children. But still the mightiness of the iniquity terrified\r\nthem, and thence created caution, delays, and frequently opposite\r\ncounsels.\r\n\r\nDuring this, in the beginning of the year, Drusus one of the sons of\r\nGermanicus, put on the manly robe; and upon him the Senate conferred the\r\nsame honours decreed before to his brother Nero. A speech was added by\r\nTiberius with a large encomium upon his son, \"that with the tenderness\r\nof a father he used the children of his brother.\" For, Drusus, however\r\nrare it be for power and unanimity to subsist together, was esteemed\r\nbenevolent, certainly not ill-disposed, towards these youths. Now again\r\nwas revived by Tiberius the proposal of a progress into the Provinces;\r\na stale proposal, always hollow, but often feigned. He pretended \"the\r\nmultitude of veterans discharged, and thence the necessity of recruiting\r\nthe armies; that volunteers were wanting, or if already such there were,\r\nthey were chiefly the necessitous and vagabonds, and destitute of the\r\nlike modesty and courage.\" He likewise cursorily recounted the number of\r\nthe legions, and what countries they defended: a detail which I think\r\nit behoves me also to repeat; that thence may appear what was then the\r\ncomplement of the Roman forces, what kings their confederates, and how\r\nmuch more narrow the limits of the Empire.\r\n\r\nItaly was on each side guarded by two fleets; one at Misenum, one at\r\nRavenna; and the coast joining to Gaul, by the galleys taken by Augustus\r\nat the battle of Actium, and sent powerfully manned to Forojulium.\r\n[Footnote: Fréjus.] But the chief strength lay upon the Rhine; they\r\nwere eight legions, a common guard upon the Germans and the Gauls.\r\nThe reduction of Spain, lately completed, was maintained by three.\r\nMauritania was possessed by King Juba; a realm which he held as a gift\r\nfrom the Roman People: the rest of Africa by two legions; and Egypt by\r\nthe like number. Four legions kept in subjection all the mighty range\r\nof country, extending from the next limits of Syria, as far as the\r\nEuphrates, and bordering upon the Iberians, Albanians, and other\r\nPrincipalities, who by our might are protected against Foreign Powers.\r\nThrace was held by Rhoemetalces, and the sons of Cotys; and both banks\r\nof the Danube by four legions; two in Pannonia, two in Moesia. In\r\nDalmatia likewise were placed two; who, by the situation of the country,\r\nwere at hand to support the former, and had not far to march into\r\nItaly, were any sudden succours required there: though Rome too had her\r\npeculiar soldiery; three city cohorts, and nine Praetorian, enlisted\r\nchiefly out of Etruria and Umbria, or from the ancient Latium and the\r\nold Roman colonies. In the several Provinces, besides, were disposed,\r\naccording to their situation and necessity, the fleets of the several\r\nconfederates, with their squadrons and battalions; a number of forces\r\nnot much different from all the rest: but the particular detail would be\r\nuncertain; since, according to the exigency of times, they often shifted\r\nstations, with numbers sometimes enlarged, sometimes reduced.\r\n\r\nIt will, I believe, fall in properly here to review also the other parts\r\nof the Administration, and by what measures it was hitherto conducted,\r\ntill with the beginning of this year the Government of Tiberius began to\r\nwax worse. First then, all public, and every private business of moment,\r\nwas determined by the Senate: to the great men he allowed liberty of\r\ndebate: those who in their debates lapsed into flattery, he checked:\r\nin conferring preferments, he was guided by merit, by ancient nobility,\r\nrenown in war abroad, by civil accomplishments at home; insomuch that it\r\nwas manifest, his choice could not have been better. There remained to\r\nthe Consuls, there remained to the Praetors the useful marks of their\r\ndignities; to inferior magistrates the independent exercise of their\r\ncharges; and the laws, where the power of the Prince was not concerned,\r\nwere in proper force. The tributes, duties, and all public receipts,\r\nwere directed by companies of Roman knights: the management of his own\r\nrevenue he committed only to those of the most noted qualifications;\r\nmostly known by himself, and to some known by reputation alone: and when\r\nonce taken, they were continued, without all restriction of term;\r\nsince most grew old in the same employments. The populace were indeed\r\naggrieved by the dearth of provisions; but without any fault of the\r\nPrince: nay, he spared no possible expense nor pains to remedy the\r\neffects of barrenness in the earth, and of wrecks at sea. He provided\r\nthat the Provinces should not be oppressed with new impositions; and\r\nthat no extortion, or violence should be committed by the magistrates\r\nin raising the old: there were no infamous corporal punishments, no\r\nconfiscations of goods.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor's possessions through Italy, were thin; the behaviour of\r\nhis slaves modest; the freedmen who managed his house, few; and in his\r\ndisputes with particulars, the courts were open and the law equal. All\r\nwhich restraints he observed, not, in truth, in the ways of complaisance\r\nand popularity; but always stern, and for the most part terrible; yet\r\nstill he retained them, till by the death of Drusus they were abandoned:\r\nfor, while he lived they continued; because Sejanus, while he was but\r\nlaying the foundations of his power, studied to recommend himself\r\nby good counsels. He then had besides, an avenger to dread, one who\r\ndisguised not his enmity, but was frequent in his complaints; \"that\r\nwhen the son was in his prime, another was called, as coadjutor, to the\r\nGovernment; nay, how little was wanting to his being declared colleague\r\nin the Empire? That the first advances to sovereignty are steep and\r\nperilous; but, once you are entered, parties and instruments are\r\nready to espouse you. Already a camp for the guards was formed, by the\r\npleasure and authority of the captain: into whose hands the soldiers\r\nwere delivered: in the theatre of Pompey his statue was beheld: in\r\nhis grandchildren would be mixed the blood of the Drusi with that of\r\nSejanus. After all this what remained but to supplicate his modesty to\r\nrest contented.\" Nor was it rarely that he uttered these disgusts,\r\nnor to a few; besides, his wife being debauched, all his secrets were\r\nbetrayed.\r\n\r\nSejanus therefore judging it time to despatch, chose such a poison as by\r\noperating gradually, might preserve the appearances of a casual disease.\r\nThis was administered to Drusus by Lygdus the eunuch, as, eight years\r\nafter, was learnt. Now during all the days of his illness, Tiberius\r\ndisclosed no symptoms of anguish (perhaps from ostentation of a firmness\r\nof spirit) nay, when he had expired, and while he was yet unburied, he\r\nentered the Senate; and finding the Consuls placed upon a common seat,\r\nas a testimony of their grief; he admonished them of their dignity and\r\nstation: and as the Senators burst into tears, he smothered his rising\r\nsighs, and, by a speech uttered without hesitation, animated them. \"He,\r\nin truth, was not ignorant,\" he said, \"that he might be censured,\r\nfor having thus in the first throbs of sorrow, beheld the face of the\r\nSenate; when most of those who feel the fresh pangs of mourning, can\r\nscarce endure the soothings of their kindred, scarce behold the day:\r\nneither were such to be condemned of weakness: but for himself, he\r\nhad more powerful consolations; such as arose from embracing the\r\nCommonwealth, and pursuing her welfare.\" He then lamented \"the extreme\r\nage of his mother, the tender years of his grandsons, his own days in\r\ndeclension;\" and desired that, \"as the only alleviation of the present\r\nevils, the children of Germanicus might be introduced.\" The Consuls\r\ntherefore went for them, and having with kind words fortified their\r\nyoung minds, presented them to the Emperor. He took them by the hand\r\nand said, \"Conscript Fathers, these infants, bereft of their father, I\r\ncommitted to their uncle; and besought him that, though he had issue\r\nof his own, he would rear and nourish them no otherwise than as the\r\nimmediate offspring of his blood; that he would appropriate them as\r\nstays to himself and posterity. Drusus being snatched from us, to you I\r\naddress the same prayers; and in the presence of the Gods, in the face\r\nof your country, I adjure you, receive into your protection, take under\r\nyour tuition the great-grandchildren of Augustus; children, descended\r\nfrom ancestors the most glorious in the State: towards them fulfil your\r\nown, fulfil my duty. To you, Nero; to you, Drusus, these Senators are in\r\nthe stead of a father; and such is the situation of your birth, that on\r\nthe Commonwealth must light all the good and evil which befalls you.\"\r\n\r\nAll this was heard with much weeping, and followed with propitious\r\nprayers and vows: and had he only gone thus far, and in his speech\r\nobserved a medium, he had left the souls of his hearers full of sympathy\r\nand applause. But, by renewing an old project, always chimerical and so\r\noften ridiculed, about \"restoring the Republic, reinstating it again\r\nin the Consuls, or whoever else would undertake the administration;\"\r\nhe forfeited his faith even in assertions which were commendable and\r\nsincere. To the memory of Drusus were decreed the same solemnities as\r\nto that of Germanicus; with many super-added; agreeably to the genius\r\nof flattery, which delights in variety and improvements. Most signal was\r\nthe lustre of the funeral in a conspicuous procession of images; when at\r\nit appeared in a pompous train, Aeneas, father of the Julian race;\r\nall the kings of Alba, and Romulus founder of Rome; next the Sabine\r\nnobility, Attus Clausus, and his descendants of the Claudian family.\r\n\r\nIn relating the death of Drusus, I have followed the greatest part of\r\nour historians, and the most faithful: I would not however omit a rumour\r\nwhich in those times was so prevailing that it is not extinguished in\r\nours; \"that Sejanus having by adultery gained Livia to the murder, had\r\nlikewise engaged by constupration the affections and concurrence of\r\nLygdus the eunuch; because Lygdus was, for his youth and loveliness,\r\ndear to his master, and one of his chief attendants: that when the time\r\nand place of poisoning, were by the conspirators concerted; the eunuch\r\ncarried his boldness so high, as to charge upon Drusus a design of\r\npoisoning Tiberius; and secretly warning the Emperor of this, advised\r\nhim to shun the first draught offered him in the next entertainment\r\nat his son's: that the old man possessed with this fictitious treason,\r\nafter he had sate down to table, having received the cup delivered it to\r\nDrusus, who ignorantly and gaily drank it off: that this heightened the\r\njealousy and apprehensions of Tiberius, as if through fear and shame\r\nhis son had swallowed the same death, which for his father he had\r\ncontrived.\"\r\n\r\nThese bruitings of the populace, besides that they are supported by no\r\ncertain author, may be easily refuted. For, who of common prudence (much\r\nless Tiberius so long practised in great affairs) would to his own son,\r\nwithout hearing him, present the mortal bane; with his own hands too,\r\nand cutting off for ever all possibility of retraction? Why would he not\r\nrather have tortured the minister of the poison? Why not inquired into\r\nthe author of the poison? Why not observed towards his only son, a son\r\nhitherto convicted of no iniquity, that slowness and hesitation, which,\r\neven in his proceedings against strangers, was inherent in him? But as\r\nSejanus was reckoned the framer of every wickedness, therefore, from the\r\nexcessive fondness of Tiberius towards him, and from the hatred of all\r\nothers towards both, things the most fabulous and direful were believed\r\nof them; besides that common fame is ever most fraught with tales of\r\nhorror upon the departure of Princes: in truth, the plan and process of\r\nthe murder were first discovered by Apicata, wife of Sejanus, and laid\r\nopen upon the rack by Eudemus and Lygdus. Nor has any writer appeared\r\nso outrageous to charge it upon Tiberius; though in other instances\r\nthey have sedulously collected and inflamed every action of his. My own\r\npurpose in recounting and censuring this rumour, was to blast, by so\r\nglaring an example, the credit of groundless tales; and to request of\r\nthose into whose hands our present undertaking shall come, that they\r\nwould not prefer hearsays, void of credibility and rashly swallowed, to\r\nthe narrations of truth not adulterated with romance.\r\n\r\nTo proceed; whilst Tiberius was pronouncing in public the panegyric of\r\nhis son, the Senate and People assumed the port and accent of mourners,\r\nrather in appearance than cordially; and in their hearts exulted to see\r\nthe house of Germanicus begin to revive. But this dawn of fortune,\r\nand the conduct of Agrippina, ill disguising her hopes, quickened the\r\noverthrow of that house. For Sejanus, when he saw the death of Drusus\r\npass unrevenged upon his murderers, and no public lamentation following\r\nit; undaunted as he was in villainy since his first efforts had\r\nsucceeded; cast about in himself, how he might destroy the sons of\r\nGermanicus, whose succession to the Empire was now unquestionable. They\r\nwere three; and, from the distinguished fidelity of their governors, and\r\nincorruptible chastity of Agrippina, could not be all circumvented by\r\npoison. He therefore chose to attack her another way; to raise alarms\r\nfrom the haughtiness and contumacy of her spirit; to rouse the old\r\nhatred of Livia the elder, and the guilty mind of his late accomplice,\r\nLivia the younger; that to the Emperor they might represent her\r\n\"as elated with the credit and renown of her fruitfulness; and that\r\nconfiding in it, and in the zeal of the populace, she grasped with open\r\narms at the Empire.\" The young Livia acted in this engagement by crafty\r\ncalumniators; amongst whom she had particularly chosen Julius Posthumus,\r\na man every way qualified for her purposes; as he was the adulterer of\r\nMutilia Prisca, and thence a confidant of her grandmother's; (for over\r\nthe mind of the Empress, Prisca had powerful influence) and by their\r\nmeans the old woman, in her own nature tender and anxious of power, was\r\nrendered utterly irreconcilable to the widow of her grandson. Such too\r\nas were nearest the person of Agrippina, were promoted to be continually\r\nenraging her tempestuous heart by perverse representations.\r\n\r\nThis year also brought deputations from the Grecian cities; one from the\r\npeople of Samos; one from those of Coös; the former to request that the\r\nancient right of Sanctuary in the Temple of Juno might be confirmed;\r\nthe latter to solicit the same confirmation for that of Aesculapius. The\r\nSamians claimed upon a decree of the Council of Amphictyons, the supreme\r\nJudicature of Greece, at the time when the Greeks by their cities\r\nfounded in Asia, possessed the maritime coasts. Nor had they of Coös a\r\nweaker title to antiquity; to which likewise accrued the pretensions of\r\nthe place to the friendship of Rome: for they had lodged in the Temple\r\nof Aesculapius all the Roman citizens there, when by the order of King\r\nMithridates, such were universally butchered throughout all the cities\r\nof Asia and the Isles. And now after many complaints from the Praetors,\r\nfor the most part ineffectual, the Emperor at last made a representation\r\nto the Senate, concerning the licentiousness of the players; \"that in\r\nmany instances they raised seditious tumults, and violated the public\r\npeace; and, in many, promoted debauchery in private families: that the\r\n_Oscan Farce_, formerly only the contemptible delight of the vulgar,\r\nwas risen to such a prevailing pitch of credit and enormity, that it\r\nrequired the authority of the Senate to check it.\" The players therefore\r\nwere driven out of Italy.\r\n\r\nThe same year carried off one of the twins of Drusus, and thence\r\nafflicted the Emperor with fresh woe; nor with less for the death of a\r\nparticular friend. It was Lucillius Longus, the inseparable companion\r\nof all the traverses of his fortune smiling or sad; and, of all the\r\nSenators, the only one who accompanied him in his retirement at Rhodes.\r\nFor this reason, though but a new man, the Senate decreed him a public\r\nfuneral; and a statue to be placed, at the expense of the Treasury, in\r\nthe square of Augustus. For by the Senate, even yet, all affairs were\r\ntransacted; insomuch that Lucillius Capito, the Emperor's Comptroller in\r\nAsia, was, at the accusation of the Province, brought upon his defence\r\nbefore them: the Emperor too upon this occasion protested with great\r\nearnestness, \"that from him Lucillius had no authority but over his\r\nslaves, and in collecting his domestic rents: that if he had usurped\r\nthe jurisdiction of Praetor, and employed military force, he had so far\r\nviolated his orders; they should therefore hear the allegations of the\r\nProvince.\" Thus the accused was upon trial condemned. For this just\r\nvengeance, and that inflicted the year before on Caius Silanus, the\r\ncities of Asia decreed a temple to Tiberius, and his mother, and the\r\nSenate; and obtained leave to build it. For this concession Nero made\r\na speech of thanks to the Senators and his grandfather; a speech which\r\ncharmed the affections of his hearers, who, as they were full of the\r\nmemory of Germanicus, fancied it was him they heard, and him they\r\nsaw. There was also in the youth himself an engaging modesty, and a\r\ngracefulness becoming a princely person: ornaments which, by the known\r\nhatred that threatened him from Sejanus, became still more dear and\r\nadored.\r\n\r\nI am aware that most of the transactions which I have already related,\r\nor shall hereafter relate, may perhaps appear minute, and too trivial to\r\nbe remembered. But, none must compare these my annals with the writings\r\nof those who compiled the story of the ancient Roman People. They had\r\nfor their subjects mighty wars, potent cities sacked, great kings routed\r\nand taken captive: or if they sometimes reviewed the domestic affairs of\r\nRome, they there found the mutual strife and animosities of the Consuls\r\nand Tribunes; the agrarian and frumentary laws, pushed and opposed; and\r\nthe lasting struggles between the nobles and populace. Large and noble\r\ntopics these, at home and abroad, and recounted by the old historians\r\nwith full room and free scope. To me remains a straitened task, and void\r\nof glory; steady peace, or short intervals of war; the proceedings at\r\nRome sad and affecting; and a Prince careless of extending the Empire:\r\nnor yet will it be without its profit to look minutely into such\r\ntransactions, as however small at first view, give rise and motion to\r\ngreat events.\r\n\r\nFor, all nations and cities are governed either by the populace, by the\r\nnobility, or by single rulers. As to the frame of a state chosen\r\nand compacted out of all these three, it is easier applauded than\r\naccomplished; or if accomplished, cannot be of long duration. So that,\r\nas during the Republic, either when the power of the people prevailed,\r\nor when the Senate bore the chief sway; it was necessary to know the\r\ngenius of the commonalty, and by what measures they were to be humoured\r\nand restrained; and such too who were thoroughly acquainted with the\r\nspirit of the Senate and leading men, came to be esteemed skilful in the\r\ntimes, and men of prowess: so now when that establishment is changed,\r\nand the present situation such as if one ruled all; it is of advantage\r\nto collect and record these later incidents, as matters of public\r\nexample and instruction; since few can by their own wisdom distinguish\r\nbetween things crooked and upright; few between counsels pernicious and\r\nprofitable; and since most men are taught by the fate of others. But the\r\npresent detail, however instructive, yet brings scanty delight. It is by\r\nthe descriptions and accounts of nations; by the variety of battles; by\r\nthe brave fall of illustrious captains, that the soul of the reader\r\nis engaged and refreshed. For myself, I can only give a sad display\r\nof cruel orders, incessant accusations, faithless friendships, the\r\ndestruction of innocents, and endless trials, all attended with the\r\nsame issue, death and condemnation: an obvious round of repetition and\r\nsatiety! Besides that the old historians are rarely censured; nor is any\r\nman now concerned whether they chiefly magnify the Roman or Carthaginian\r\narmies. But, of many who under Tiberius suffered punishment, or were\r\nmarked with infamy, the posterity are still subsisting; or if the\r\nfamilies themselves are extinct, there are others found, who from\r\na similitude of manners, think that, in reciting the evil doings of\r\nothers, they themselves are charged: nay, even virtue and a glorious\r\nname create foes, as they expose in a light too obvious the opposite\r\ncharacters. But I return to my undertaking.\r\n\r\nWhilst Cornelius Cossus and Asinius Agrippa were Consuls, Cremutius\r\nCordus was arraigned for that, \"having published annals and in them\r\npraised Brutus, he had styled Cassius the last of the Romans:\" a new\r\ncrime, then first created. Satrius Secundus and Pinarius Natta were\r\nhis accusers; creatures of Sejanus: a mortal omen this to the accused;\r\nbesides that Tiberius received his defence with a countenance settled\r\ninto cruelty. He began it on this wise, casting away all hopes of life:\r\n\r\n\"As to facts, I am so guiltless, Conscript Fathers, that my words only\r\nare accused: but neither are any words of mine pointed against the\r\nEmperor, or his mother; who are the only persons comprehended in the law\r\nconcerning violated majesty. It is alleged that I have praised Brutus\r\nand Cassius; men whose lives and actions have been compiled by a cloud\r\nof writers, and their memory treated by none but with honour. Titus\r\nLivius, an historian eminently famous for eloquence and veracity,\r\nsignalised Pompey with such abundant encomiums, that he was thence\r\nby Augustus named Pompeianus; nor did this prejudice their common\r\nfriendship. Neither Scipio, nor Afranius, nor even this same Cassius,\r\nnor this same Brutus, are anywhere mentioned by him as _traitors_ and\r\n_parricides_, the common nicknames now bestowed on them; but often, as\r\ngreat and memorable men. The writings of Asinius Pollio have conveyed\r\ndown the memory of the same men, under honourable characters. Corvinus\r\nMessala gloried to have had Cassius for his general: and yet both\r\nPollio and Corvinus became signally powerful in wealth and honours under\r\nAugustus. That book of Cicero's, in which he exalted Cato to the skies;\r\nwhat other animadversion did it draw from Caesar the Dictator, than a\r\nwritten reply, in the same style and equality as if before his judges\r\nhe had made it? The letters of Marc Anthony; the speeches of Brutus, are\r\nfull of reproaches, and recriminations against Augustus; false in truth,\r\nbut urged with signal asperity: the poems of Bibaculus and those of\r\nCatullus, stuffed with virulent satires against the Caesars, are still\r\nread. But even the deified Julius, even the deified Augustus, bore all\r\nthese invectives and disdained them; whether with greater moderation or\r\nwisdom, I cannot easily say. For, if they are despised, they fade away;\r\nif you wax wroth, you seem to avow them to be just.\r\n\r\n\"Instances from the Greeks I bring none: with them not the freedom\r\nonly, but even the licentiousness of speech, is unpunished: or if any\r\ncorrection is returned, it is only by revenging words with words. It has\r\nbeen ever allowed, without restriction or rebuke, to pass our judgment\r\nupon those whom death has withdrawn from the influence of affection and\r\nhate. Are Cassius and Brutus now in arms? do they at present fill with\r\narmed troops the fields of Philippi? or do I fire the Roman People,\r\nby inflammatory harangues, with the spirit of civil rage? Brutus\r\nand Cassius, now above seventy years slain, are still known in their\r\nstatues, which even the conqueror did not abolish: and as these exhibit\r\ntheir persons, why not the historian their characters? Impartial\r\nposterity to every man repays his proper praise: nor will there be\r\nwanting such as, if my death is determined, will not only revive the\r\nstory of Cassius and Brutus, but even my story.\" Having thus said he\r\nwithdrew from the Senate, and ended his life by abstinence. The\r\nFathers condemned the books to be by the Aediles burned; but they\r\nstill continued concealed and dispersed: hence we may justly mock\r\nthe stupidity of those, who imagine that they can, by present power,\r\nextinguish the lights and memory of succeeding times: for, quite\r\notherwise, the punishment of writers exalts the credit of the writings:\r\nnor did ever foreign kings, or any else, reap other fruit from it, than\r\ninfamy to themselves, and glory to the sufferers.\r\n\r\nTo proceed; for this whole year there was such an incessant torrent of\r\naccusations, that even during the solemnity of the Latin festival,\r\nwhen Drusus for his inauguration, as Governor of Rome, had ascended the\r\nTribunal, he was accosted by Calpurnius Salvianus with a charge against\r\nSextus Marius: a proceeding openly resented by the Emperor, and thence\r\nSalvianus was banished. The city of Cyzicus was next accused, \"of\r\nnot observing the established worship of the deified Augustus;\" with\r\nadditional crimes, \"of violences committed upon some Roman citizens.\"\r\nThus that city lost her liberties; which by her behaviour during the\r\nMithridatic war, she had purchased; having in it sustained a siege;\r\nand as much by her own bravery, as by the aid of Lucullus, repulsed\r\nthe king, But Fonteius Capito, who had as Proconsul governed Asia, was\r\nacquitted, upon proof that the crimes brought against him by Vibius\r\nSerenus were forged: and yet the forgery drew no penalty upon Serenus:\r\nnay, the public hate rendered him the more secure: for, every accuser,\r\nthe more eager and incessant he was, the more sacred and inviolable he\r\nbecame: the sorry and impotent were surrendered to chastisement.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time, the furthermost Spain besought the Senate by their\r\nambassadors, \"that after the example of Asia, they might erect a temple\r\nto Tiberius and his mother.\" Upon this occasion, the Emperor, always\r\nresolute in contemning honours, and now judging it proper to confute\r\nthose, who exposed him to the popular censure, of having deviated into\r\nambition; spoke in this manner: \"I know, Conscript Fathers, that it is\r\ngenerally blamed, and ascribed to a defect of firmness in me, that when\r\nthe cities of Asia petitioned for this very thing, I withstood them not.\r\nI shall therefore now unfold at once the motives of my silence then,\r\nand the rules which for the future I am determined to observe. Since the\r\ndeified Augustus had not opposed the founding at Pergamus a temple to\r\nhimself and the city of Rome; I, with whom all his actions and sayings\r\nhave the force of laws, followed an example already approved; and\r\nfollowed it the more cheerfully, because to the worship bestowed upon\r\nme, that of the Senate was annexed. But as the indulging of this, in\r\none instance, will find pardon; so a general latitude of being adored\r\nthrough every province, under the sacred representations of the Deities,\r\nwould denote a vain spirit; a heart swelled with ambition. The glory too\r\nof Augustus will vanish, if by the promiscuous courtship of flattery it\r\ncomes to be vulgarly prostituted.\r\n\r\n\"For myself, Conscript Fathers, I am a mortal man; I am confined to\r\nthe functions of human nature; and if I well supply the principal\r\nplace amongst you, it suffices me. This I acknowledge to you; and\r\nthis acknowledgment, I would have posterity to remember. They will do\r\nabundant right to my memory, if they believe me to have been worthy of\r\nmy ancestors; watchful of the Roman state; unmoved in perils, and in\r\nmaintaining the public interest, fearless of private enmities. These\r\nare the temples which in your breasts I would raise; these the fairest\r\nportraitures, and such as will endure. As to temples and statues of\r\nstone, if the idol adored in them comes to be hated by posterity, they\r\nare despised as his sepulchres. Hence it is I here invoke the Gods,\r\nthat to the end of my life they would grant me a spirit undisturbed, and\r\ndiscerning in duties human and divine: and hence too I here implore our\r\ncitizens and allies, that whenever my dissolution comes, they would\r\nwith approbation and benevolent testimonies of remembrance, celebrate\r\nmy actions and retain the odour of my name.\" And thenceforward he\r\npersevered in slighting upon all occasions, and even in private\r\nconversation, this divine worship of himself. A conduct which was by\r\nsome ascribed to modesty; by many to a conscious diffidence; by others\r\nto degeneracy of spirit. \"Since the most sublime amongst men naturally\r\ncovet the most exalted honours: thus Hercules and Bacchus amongst the\r\nGreeks, and with us Romulus, were added to the society of the Gods:\r\nAugustus too had chosen the nobler part, and hoped for deification: all\r\nthe other gratifications of Princes were instantly procured: one only\r\nwas to be pursued insatiably; the praise and perpetuity of their name.\r\nFor by contemning fame, the virtues that procure it, are contemned.\"\r\n\r\nNow Sejanus, intoxicated with excess of fortune, and moreover stimulated\r\nby the importunity of Livia, who, with the restless passion of a woman,\r\ncraved the promised marriage, composed a memorial to the Emperor.\r\nFor, it was then the custom to apply to him in writing, though he were\r\npresent. This of Sejanus was thus conceived: \"That such had been towards\r\nhim the benevolence of Augustus; such and so numerous, since, the\r\ninstances of affection from Tiberius, that he was thence accustomed,\r\nwithout applying to the Gods, to carry his hopes and prayers directly\r\nto the Emperors: yet of them he had never sought a blaze of honours:\r\nwatching and toils like those of common soldiers, for the safeguard\r\nof the Prince, had been his choice and ambition. However what was most\r\nglorious for him he had attained; to be thought worthy of alliance with\r\nthe Emperor: hence the source of his present hopes: and, since he had\r\nheard that Augustus, in the disposal of his daughter, had not been\r\nwithout thoughts even of some of the Roman knights; he begged that if a\r\nhusband were sought for Livia, Tiberius would remember his friend; one\r\nwhose ambition aimed no higher than the pure and disinterested glory of\r\nthe affinity: for that he would never abandon the burden of his present\r\ntrust; but hold it sufficient to be, by that means, enabled to support\r\nhis house against the injurious wrath of Agrippina; and in this he only\r\nconsulted the security of his children. For himself; his own life would\r\nbe abundantly long, whenever finally spent in the ministry of such a\r\nPrince.\"\r\n\r\nFor a present answer, Tiberius praised the loyalty of Sejanus;\r\nrecapitulated cursorily the instances of his own favours towards him,\r\nand required time, as it were for a thorough deliberation. At last he\r\nmade this reply: \"That all other men were, in their pursuits, guided by\r\nthe notions of convenience: far different was the lot and situation of\r\nPrinces, who were in their action to consider chiefly the applause and\r\ngood liking of the public: he therefore did not delude Sejanus with\r\nan obvious and plausible answer; that Livia could herself determine\r\nwhether, after Drusus, she ought again to marry, or still persist his\r\nwidow, and that she had a mother and grandmother, nearer relations and\r\nmore interested to advise. He would deal more candidly with him: and\r\nfirst as to the enmity of Agrippina; it would flame out with fresh fury,\r\nif by the marriage of Livia, the family of the Caesars were rent as\r\nit were into two contending parties: that even as things stood, the\r\nemulation of these ladies broke into frequent sallies, and, by their\r\nanimosities, his grandsons were instigated different ways. What would be\r\nthe consequence, if, by such a marriage, the strife were inflamed? For\r\nyou are deceived, Sejanus, if you think to continue then in the same\r\nrank as now; or that Livia, she who was first the wife of the young\r\nCaius Caesar, and afterwards the wife of Drusus, will be of a temper\r\nto grow old with a husband no higher than a Roman knight: nay, allowing\r\nthat I suffered you afterwards to remain what you are; do you believe\r\nthat they who saw her father, they who saw her brother, and the\r\nancestors of our house, covered with the supreme dignities, will ever\r\nsuffer it? You in truth propose, yourself, to stand still in the same\r\nstation: but the great magistrates and grandees of the state, those very\r\nmagistrates and grandees who, in spite of yourself, break in upon\r\nyou, and in all affairs court you as their oracle, make no secret\r\nof maintaining that you have long since exceeded the bounds of the\r\nEquestrian Order, and far outgone in power all the confidants of my\r\nfather; and from their hatred to you, they also censure me. But still,\r\nAugustus deliberated about giving his daughter to a Roman knight. Where\r\nis the wonder, if perplexed with a crowd of distracting cares, and\r\napprised to what an unbounded height above others he raised whomsoever\r\nhe dignified with such a match, he talked of Proculeius, and some like\r\nhim; remarkable for the retiredness of their life, and nowise engaged\r\nin the affairs of state? But if we are influenced by the hesitation of\r\nAugustus, how much more powerful is the decision; since he bestowed his\r\ndaughter on Agrippa, and then on me? These are considerations which in\r\nfriendship I have not withheld: however, neither your own inclinations,\r\nnor those of Livia, shall be ever thwarted by me. The secret and\r\nconstant purposes of my own heart towards you, and with what further\r\nties of affinity, I am contriving to bind you still faster to me; I at\r\npresent forbear to recount. Thus much only I will declare, that there is\r\nnothing so high but those abilities, and your singular zeal and fidelity\r\ntowards me, may justly claim: as when opportunity presents, either in\r\nSenate, or in a popular assembly, I shall not fail to testify.\"\r\n\r\nIn answer to this, Sejanus no longer soliciting the marriage, but filled\r\nwith higher apprehensions, besought him \"to resist the dark suggestions\r\nof suspicion; to despise the pratings of the vulgar, nor to admit the\r\nhostile breath of envy.\" And as he was puzzled about the crowds which\r\nincessantly haunted his house; lest by keeping them off he might\r\nimpair his power; or by encouraging them, furnish a handle for criminal\r\nimputations; he came to this result, that he would urge the Emperor out\r\nof Rome, to spend his life remote from thence in delightful retirements.\r\nFrom this counsel he foresaw many advantages: upon himself would depend\r\nall access to the Emperor; all letters and expresses would, as the\r\nsoldiers were the carriers, be in great measure under his direction; in\r\na little time, the Prince, now in declining age, and then softened by\r\nrecess, would more easily transfer upon him the whole charge of the\r\nEmpire: he should be removed from the multitude of such as to make their\r\ncourt, attended him at Rome; and thence one source of envy would be\r\nstopped. So that by discharging the empty phantoms of power, he should\r\naugment the essentials. He therefore began by little and little to rail\r\nat the hurry of business at Rome, the throng of people, the flock of\r\nsuitors: he applauded \"retirement and quiet; where, while they were\r\nseparate from irksome fatigues, nor exposed to the discontents and\r\nresentments of particulars, all affairs of moment were best despatched.\"\r\n\r\nNext were heard ambassadors from the Lacedaemonians and Messenians,\r\nabout the right that each people claimed to the Temple of Diana\r\nLimenetis; which the Lacedaemonians asserted to be theirs, \"founded\r\nin their territory, and dedicated by their ancestors,\" and offered as\r\nproofs the ancient authority of their annals, and the hymns of the old\r\npoets. \"It had been in truth taken from them by the superior force of\r\nPhilip of Macedon, when at war with him; but restored afterwards by the\r\njudicial decision of Julius Caesar and Marc Anthony.\" The Messenians,\r\non the contrary, pleaded, \"the ancient partition of Peloponnesus amongst\r\nthe descendants of Hercules; whence the territory where the temple\r\nstood, had fallen to their king; and the monuments of that allotment\r\nstill remained, engraven in stone and old tables of brass; but, if the\r\ntestimony of histories and poets were appealed to; they themselves had\r\nthe most and the fullest. Nor had Philip, in his decision, acted by\r\npower, but from equity: the same afterwards was the adjudgment of King\r\nAntigonus; the same that of the Roman commander Mummius. Thus too the\r\nMilesians had awarded, they who were by both sides chosen arbitrators:\r\nand thus lastly it had been determined by Atidius Geminus, Praetor of\r\nAchaia.\" The Messenians therefore gained the suit. The citizens also of\r\nSegestum applied on behalf of \"the Temple of Venus on Mount Eryx; which\r\nfallen through age, they desired might be restored.\" They represented\r\nthe story of its origin and antiquity; a well-pleasing flattery to\r\nTiberius; who frankly took upon himself the charge, as kinsman to\r\nthe Goddess. Then was discussed the petition from the citizens of\r\nMarseilles; and what they claimed, according to the precedent of Publius\r\nRutilius, was approved: for Rutilius, though by a law expelled from\r\nRome, had been by those of Smyrna adopted a citizen: and as Volcatius\r\nMoschus, another exile, had found at Marseilles the same privilege and\r\nreception, he had to their Republic, as to his country, left his estate.\r\n\r\nDuring the same Consuls, a bloody assassination was perpetrated in the\r\nnethermost Spain, by a boor in the territory of Termes. By him, Lucius\r\nPiso, Governor of the Province, as he travelled careless and unattended,\r\nrelying on the established peace, was surprised, and despatched at one\r\ndeadly blow. The assassin however escaped to a forest, by the fleetness\r\nof his horse; and there dismissed him: from thence travelling over rocks\r\nand pathless places, he baffled his pursuers: but their ignorance of his\r\nperson was soon removed; for his horse being taken and shown through the\r\nneighbouring villages, it was thence learned who was the owner; so that\r\nhe too was found; but when put to the rack to declare his accomplices,\r\nhe proclaimed with a mighty and assured voice, in the language of his\r\ncountry, \"that in vain they questioned him; his associates might stand\r\nsafely by and witness his constancy: and that no force of torture could\r\nbe so exquisite as from him to extort a discovery.\" Next day as he\r\nwas dragged back to the rack, he burst with a vehement effort from\r\nhis guard, and dashed his head so desperately against a stone, that he\r\ninstantly expired. Piso is believed to have been assassinated by a plot\r\nof the Termestinians; as in exacting the repayment of some money, seized\r\nfrom the public, he acted with more asperity, than a rough people could\r\nbear.\r\n\r\nIn the Consulship of Lentulus Getulicus and Caius Calvisius, the\r\ntriumphal ensigns were decreed to Poppeus Sabinus for having routed\r\nsome clans of Thracians, who living wildly on the high mountains, acted\r\nthence with the more outrage and contumacy. The ground of their late\r\ncommotion, not to mention the savage genius of the people, was their\r\nscorn and impatience, to have recruits raised amongst them, and all\r\ntheir stoutest men enlisted in our armies; accustomed as they were not\r\neven to obey their native kings further than their own humour, nor to\r\naid them with forces but under captains of their own choosing, nor to\r\nfight against any enemy but their own borderers. Their discontents too\r\nwere inflamed by a rumour which then ran current amongst them; that they\r\nwere to be dispersed into different regions; and exterminated from their\r\nown, to be mixed with other nations. But before they took arms and began\r\nhostilities, they sent ambassadors to Sabinus, to represent \"their past\r\nfriendship and submission, and that the same should continue, if they\r\nwere provoked by no fresh impositions: but, if like a people subdued by\r\nwar, they were doomed to bondage; they had able men and steel, and souls\r\ndetermined upon liberty or death.\" The ambassadors at the same time\r\npointed to their strongholds founded upon precipices; and boasted that\r\nthey had thither conveyed their wives and parents; and threatened a war\r\nintricate, hazardous and bloody.\r\n\r\nSabinus amused them with gentle answers till he could draw together his\r\narmy; while Pomponius Labeo was advancing with a legion from Moesia, and\r\nKing Rhoemetalces with a body of Thracians who had not renounced their\r\nallegiance. With these, and what forces he had of his own, he marched\r\ntowards the foe, now settled in the passes of the forest: some more bold\r\npresented themselves upon the hills: against the last, the Roman general\r\nfirst bent his forces in battle, and without difficulty drove them\r\nthence, but with small slaughter of the Barbarians, because of their\r\nimmediate refuge. Here he straight raised an encampment, and with a\r\nstout band took possession of a hill, which extended with an even narrow\r\nridge to the next fortress, which was garrisoned by a great host of\r\narmed men and rabble: and as the most resolute were, in the way of\r\nthe nation, rioting without the fortification in dances and songs, he\r\nforthwith despatched against them his select archers. These, while they\r\nonly poured in volleys of arrows at a distance did thick and extensive\r\nexecution; but, approaching too near, were by a sudden sally put in\r\ndisorder. They were however supported by a cohort of the Sigambrians,\r\npurposely posted by Sabinus in readiness against an exigency; a people\r\nthese, equally terrible in the boisterous and mixed uproar of their\r\nvoices and arms.\r\n\r\nHe afterwards pitched his camp nearer to the enemy; having in his former\r\nentrenchments left the Thracians, whom I have mentioned to have joined\r\nus. To them too was permitted \"to lay waste, burn, and plunder; on\r\ncondition that their ravages were confined to the day; and that, at\r\nnights, they kept within the camp, secure under guard.\" This restriction\r\nwas at first observed; but, anon lapsing into luxury, and grown opulent\r\nin plunder, they neglected their guards, and resigned themselves to\r\ngaiety and banquetting, to the intoxication and sloth of wine and sleep.\r\nThe enemy therefore apprised of their negligence, formed themselves\r\ninto two bands; one to set upon the plunderers; the other to assault\r\nthe Roman camp, with no hopes of taking it; but only that the soldiers\r\nalarmed with shouts and darts, and all intent upon their own defence,\r\nmight not hear the din of the other battle: moreover to heighten the\r\nterror, it was to be done by night. Those who assailed the lines of\r\nthe legions were easily repulsed: but, the auxiliary Thracians were\r\nterrified with the sudden encounter, as they were utterly unprepared.\r\nPart of them lay along the entrenchments; many were roaming abroad; and\r\nboth were slain with the keener vengeance, as they were upbraided \"for\r\nfugitives and traitors, who bore arms to establish servitude over their\r\ncountry and themselves.\"\r\n\r\nNext day Sabinus drew up his army in view of the enemy, on ground equal\r\nto both; to try, if elated with their success by night, they would\r\nventure a battle: and, when they still kept within the fortress, or\r\non the cluster of hills, he began to begird them with a siege; and\r\nstrengthening his old lines and adding new, enclosed a circuit of four\r\nmiles. Then to deprive them of water and forage, he straitened his\r\nentrenchment by degrees, and hemmed them in still closer. A bulwark\r\nwas also raised, whence the enemy now within throw, were annoyed with\r\ndischarges of stones, darts, and fire. But nothing aggrieved them so\r\nvehemently as thirst, whilst only a single fountain remained amongst a\r\nhuge multitude of armed men and families: their horses too and cattle,\r\npenned up with the people, after the barbarous manner of the country,\r\nperished for want of provender: amongst the carcasses of beasts lay\r\nthose of men; some dead of thirst, some of their wounds; a noisome\r\nmixture of misery and death; all was foul and tainted with putrefaction,\r\nstench, and filthy contamination. To these distresses also accrued\r\nanother, and of all calamities the most consummate, the calamity of\r\ndiscord: some were disposed to surrender; others proposed present death,\r\nand to fall upon one another. There were some too who advised a sally,\r\nand to die avenging their deaths. Nor were these last mean men, though\r\ndissenting from the rest.\r\n\r\nBut there was one of their leaders, his name Dinis, a man stricken in\r\nyears, who, by long experience, acquainted with the power and clemency\r\nof the Romans, argued, \"that they must lay down their arms, the same\r\nbeing the sole cure for their pressing calamities;\" and was the first\r\nwho submitted, with his wife and children to the conqueror. There\r\nfollowed him all that were weak through sex or age, and such as had a\r\ngreater passion for life than glory. The young men were parted between\r\nTarsa and Turesis; both determined to fall with liberty: but Tarsa\r\ndeclared earnestly \"for instant death; and that by it all hopes and\r\nfears were at once to be extinguished;\" and setting an example, buried\r\nhis sword in his breast. Nor were there wanting some who despatched\r\nthemselves the same way. Turesis and his band stayed for night: of\r\nwhich our General was aware. The guards were therefore strengthened\r\nwith extraordinary reinforcements: and now with the night, darkness\r\nprevailed, its horror heightened by outrageous rain; and the enemy with\r\ntumultuous shouts, and by turns with vast silence, alarmed and puzzled\r\nthe besiegers. Sabinus therefore going round the camp, warned the\r\nsoldiers, \"that they should not be misguided by the deceitful voice of\r\nuproar, nor trust to a feigned calm, and thence open an advantage to the\r\nenemy, who by these wiles sought it; but keep immovably to their several\r\nposts; nor throw their darts at random.\"\r\n\r\nJust then came the Barbarians, pouring in distinct droves: here, with\r\nstones, with wooden javelins hardened in the fire, and with the broken\r\nlimbs of trees, they battered the palisade: there with hurdles, faggots\r\nand dead bodies, they filled the trench: by others, bridges and ladders,\r\nboth before framed, were planted against the battlements; these they\r\nviolently grappled and tore, and struggled hand to hand with those who\r\nopposed them. The Romans, on the other side, beat them back with their\r\nbucklers, drove them down with darts, and hurled upon them great mural\r\nstakes and heaps of stones. On both sides were powerful stimulations: on\r\nours the hopes of victory almost gained, if we persisted; and thence the\r\nmore glaring infamy, if we recoiled: on theirs, the last struggle for\r\ntheir life; most of them, too, inspired with the affecting presence of\r\ntheir mothers and wives, and made desperate by their dolorous wailings.\r\nThe night was an advantage to the cowardly and the brave; by it, the\r\nformer became more resolute; by it, the latter hid their fear: blows\r\nwere dealt, the striker knew not upon whom; and wounds received, the\r\nwounded knew not whence: such was the utter indistinction of friend and\r\nfoe. To heighten the general jumble and blind confusion, the echo from\r\nthe cavities of the mountain represented to the Romans the shouts of the\r\nenemy as behind them: hence in some places they deserted their lines, as\r\nbelieving them already broken and entered: and yet such of the enemy,\r\nas broke through, were very few. All the rest, their most resolute\r\nchampions being wounded or slain, were at the returning light driven\r\nback to their fort; where they were at length forced to surrender; as\r\ndid the places circumjacent of their own accord. The remainder could\r\nthen be neither forced nor famished; as they were protected by a furious\r\nwinter, always sudden about Mount Haemus.\r\n\r\nAt Rome, discord shook the Prince's family: and, to begin the series of\r\ndestruction, which was to end in Agrippina, Claudia Pulchra her cousin\r\nwas accused; Domitius Afer the accuser. This man, just out of the\r\nPraetorship, in estimation small, but hasty to signalise himself by\r\nsome notable exploit however heinous, alleged against her the \"crimes\r\nof prostitution, of adultery with Furnius, of magical execrations\r\nand poison prepared against the life of the Emperor.\" Agrippina ever\r\nvehement, and then in a flame for the peril of her kinswoman, flew to\r\nTiberius, and by chance found him sacrificing to the Emperor his father.\r\nHaving got this handle for upbraiding him, she told him \"that it ill\r\nbecame the same man to slay victims to the deified Augustus and to\r\npersecute his children: his divine spirit was not transfused into dumb\r\nstatues: the genuine images of Augustus were the living descendants\r\nfrom his celestial blood: she herself was one; one sensible of impending\r\ndanger, and now in the mournful state of a supplicant. In vain were\r\nforeign crimes pretended against Pulchra; when the only cause of her\r\nconcerted overthrow was her affection for Agrippina, foolishly carried\r\neven to adoration; forgetful as she was of the fate of Sosia, a\r\ncondemned sufferer for the same fault.\" All these bitter words drew\r\nsmall answer from the dark breast of Tiberius: he rebuked her by quoting\r\na Greek verse; \"That she was therefore aggrieved, because she did not\r\nreign:\" Pulchra and Furnius were condemned. Afer, having thus displayed\r\nhis genius, and gained a declaration from Tiberius, pronouncing him\r\n_eloquent in his own independent right_, was ranked with the most\r\ncelebrated orators: afterwards in prosecuting accusations, or in\r\nprotecting the accused, he flourished more in the fame of eloquence than\r\nin that of uprightness: however, old age eminently sunk the credit and\r\nvigour of his eloquence; while, with parts decayed, he still retained\r\na passion for haranguing. [Footnote: Dum fessa mente, retinet silentii\r\ninpatientiam.]\r\n\r\nAgrippina still fostering her wrath, and seized too with a bodily\r\ndisorder, received the Emperor, come purposely to see her, with\r\nmany tears and long silence. At last she accosted him with invidious\r\nexpostulations and prayers; \"that he would relieve her solitude, and\r\ngive her a husband. She was still endowed with proper youth; to virtuous\r\nwomen there was no consolation but that of marriage; and Rome afforded\r\nillustrious men who would readily assent to entertain the wife of\r\nGermanicus, and his children.\" Tiberius was not ignorant to what mighty\r\npower in the state, that demand tended; but, that he might betray no\r\ntokens of resentment or fear, he left her, though instant with him,\r\nwithout an answer. This passage, not related by the authors of our\r\nannals, I found in the commentaries of her daughter Agrippina; her, who\r\nwas the mother of the Emperor Nero, and has published her own life with\r\nthe fortunes of her family.\r\n\r\nAs to Agrippina; still grieving and void of foresight, she was yet more\r\nsensibly dismayed by an artifice of Sejanus, who employed such, as under\r\ncolour of friendship warned her, \"that poison was prepared for her,\r\nand that she must shun eating at her father-in-law's table.\" She was a\r\nstranger to all dissimulation: so that as she sat near him at table, she\r\ncontinued stately and unmoved; not a word, not a look escaped her,\r\nand she touched no part of the meat. Tiberius observed her, whether\r\naccidentally, or that he was before apprised; and, to be convinced by\r\na more powerful experiment, praising the apples that stood before him,\r\npresented some with his own hand to his daughter-in-law. This only\r\nincreased the suspicion of Agrippina; and, without ever putting them\r\nto her mouth, she delivered them to the servants. For all this, the\r\nreserved Tiberius let not a word drop from him openly; but, turning\r\nto his mother; \"There was no wonder,\" he said, \"if he had really taken\r\nharsh measures with her, who thus charged him as a poisoner.\" Hence a\r\nrumour spread, \"that her doom was contrived; and that the Emperor not\r\ndaring to pursue it publicly, chose to have her despatched in secret.\"\r\n\r\nTiberius, as a means to divert upon other matters the popular talk,\r\nattended assiduously the deliberations of the Senate; and there heard\r\nfor many days the several Ambassadors from Asia, mutually contending,\r\n\"in what city should be built the temple lately decreed.\" For this\r\nhonour eleven cities strove, with equal ambition, though different\r\nin power: nor did the pleas urged by all, greatly vary; namely, \"the\r\nantiquity of their original, and their distinguished zeal for the Roman\r\nPeople, during their several wars with Perseus, Aristonicus, and other\r\nkings.\" But the Trallians, the Laodiceans, the Magnesians and those of\r\nthe Hypaepis, were at once dismissed, as insufficient for the charge.\r\nNor, in truth, had they of Ilium, who represented, \"that Troy was the\r\nmother of Rome,\" any superior advantage, besides the glory of antiquity.\r\nThe plea of the Halicarnassians took some short consideration: they\r\nasserted, \"that for twelve hundred years, no earthquake had shaken their\r\ntown; and that they would fix in a solid rock the foundations of the\r\ntemple.\" The same considerations were urged by the inhabitants of\r\nPergamus; where already was erected a temple to Augustus; a distinction\r\nwhich was judged sufficient for them. The cities too of Ephesus and\r\nMiletus seemed fully employed in the ceremonies of their own distinct\r\ndeities; the former in those of Diana; the other, in those of Apollo.\r\nThus the dispute was confined to Sardis and Smyrna. The first recited\r\na decree of the Etrurians, which owned them for kinsmen: \"for that\r\nTyrrhenus and Lydus, sons of King Atys, having between them divided\r\ntheir people, because of their multitude, Lydus re-settled in his\r\nnative country; and it became the lot of Tyrrhenus to find out a fresh\r\nresidence; and by the names of these chiefs the parted people came\r\nafterwards to be called, Lydians in Asia, Tyrrhenians in Italy. That the\r\nopulence of the Lydians spread yet farther, by their colonies sent\r\nunder Pelops into Greece, which from him afterwards took its name.\" They\r\nlikewise urged \"the letters of our Generals; their mutual leagues with\r\nus during the war of Macedon; their plenty of rivers, temperate climate,\r\nand the fertility of the circumjacent country.\"\r\n\r\nThe Smyrnaeans having likewise recounted their ancient establishment,\r\n\"whether Tantalus, the son of Jupiter; or Theseus, the son also of\r\na God; or one of the old Amazons, were their founder;\" proceeded to\r\nconsiderations in which they chiefly trusted; their friendly offices\r\nto the Roman People, having aided them with a naval force, not in their\r\nforeign wars only, but in those which infested Italy. \"It was they who\r\nfirst reared a temple to the City of Rome, in the Consulship of Marcus\r\nPorcius; then, in truth, when the power of the Roman People was already\r\nmighty, but however not yet raised to its highest glory; for the city of\r\nCarthage still stood, and potent kings governed Asia. Witness too their\r\ngenerosity to Sylla, when the condition of his army ready to famish in a\r\ncruel winter and a scarcity of clothes, being related to the citizens\r\nof Smyrna then assembled; all that were present divested themselves of\r\ntheir raiments, and sent them to our legions.\" Thus when the votes of\r\nthe Senators were gathered, the pretensions of Smyrna were preferred. It\r\nwas also moved by Vibius Marsus, that Lentulus, to whom had fallen\r\nthe province of Asia, should be attended by a Legate extraordinary, to\r\nsupervise the building of the temple; and as Lentulus himself through\r\nmodesty declined to choose one, several who had been Praetors were drawn\r\nby lot, and the lot fell upon Valerius Naso.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, according to a purpose long meditated, and from time to\r\ntime deferred, Tiberius at last retired to Campania; in profession, to\r\ndedicate a temple to Jupiter at Capua, and one at Nola to Augustus; but\r\nin truth determined to remove, for ever, from Rome. The cause of his\r\ndeparture, I have before referred to the stratagems of Sejanus; but\r\nthough in it I have followed most of our authors; yet, since after\r\nthe execution of Sejanus, he persisted for six years in the like dark\r\nrecess; I am rather influenced by a stronger probability, that the\r\nground of his absence is more justly to be ascribed to his own spirit,\r\nwhile he strove to hide in the shades of solitude, what in deeds he\r\nproclaimed, the rage of his cruelty and lust. There were those who\r\nbelieved that, in his old age, he was ashamed of the figure of his\r\nperson; for he was very lean, long and stooping, his head bald, his face\r\nulcerous, and for the most besmeared with salves: he was moreover\r\nwont, during his recess at Rhodes, to avoid the public, and cover his\r\ndebauches in secrecy. It is also related that he was driven from Rome by\r\nthe restless aspiring of his mother, whom he scorned to admit a partner\r\nin the sovereignty; nor yet could entirely seclude, since as her gift he\r\nhad received the sovereignty itself. For, Augustus had deliberated\r\nabout setting Germanicus at the head of the Roman state; his sister's\r\ngrandson, and one adored by all men: but subdued by the solicitations of\r\nhis wife, he adopted Tiberius; and caused Tiberius to adopt Germanicus.\r\nWith this grandeur of her own procuring, Livia upbraided her son; and\r\neven reclaimed it.\r\n\r\nHis going was narrowly accompanied; by one Senator, Cocceius Nerva,\r\nformerly Consul, and accomplished in the knowledge of the laws; and,\r\nbesides Sejanus, by one dignified Roman knight, Curtius Atticus. The\r\nrest were men of letters, chiefly Greeks; whose conversation pleased and\r\namused him. The skilled in astrology declared, \"that he had left Rome in\r\nsuch a conjunction of the planets, as for ever to exclude his return.\"\r\nHence a source of destruction to many, who conjectured his end to be\r\nat hand, and published their conjectures: for, it was an event too\r\nincredible to be foreseen, that for eleven years he should of choice\r\nbe withdrawn from his country. The sequel discovered the short bounds\r\nbetween the art and the falsehood of the art, and what obscurities\r\nperplex even the facts it happens to foretell. _That he should never\r\nreturn to Rome_, proved not to be falsely said: as to everything else\r\nabout him they were perfectly in the dark; since he still lived, never\r\nfar distant, sometimes in the adjacent champain, sometimes on the\r\nneighbouring shore, often under the very walls of the city; and died at\r\nlast in the fulness and extremity of age.\r\n\r\nThere happened to Tiberius, about that time, an accident, which, as it\r\nthreatened his life, fired the empty prognostics at Rome; but to himself\r\nproved matter of more confidence in the friendship and faith of Sejanus.\r\nThey were eating in a cave at a villa, thence called _Spelunca_, between\r\nthe Amyclean Sea and the mountains of Fondi: it was a native cave, and\r\nits mouth fell suddenly in, and buried under it some of the attendants:\r\nhence dread seized all, and they who were celebrating the entertainment\r\nfled: as to Sejanus; he covered the Emperor's body with his own, and\r\nstooping upon his knees and hands, exposed himself to the descending\r\nruin; such was the posture he was found in by the soldiers, who came to\r\ntheir relief. He grew mightier from thence; and being now considered by\r\nTiberius as one regardless of himself, all his counsels, however bloody\r\nand destructive, were listened to with blind credulity: so that he\r\nassumed the office of a judge against the offspring of Germanicus, and\r\nsuborned such as were to act the parts of accusers, and especially to\r\npursue and blacken Nero, the next in succession; a young Prince modest\r\nindeed, but forgetful of that restraint and circumspection which his\r\npresent situation required. He was misguided by his freedmen and the\r\nretainers to his house; who eager to be masters of power, animated him\r\nwith intemperate counsels; \"that he would show a spirit resolute and\r\nassured; it was what the Roman People wished, what the armies longed\r\nfor: nor would Sejanus dare then to resist; though he now equally\r\ninsulted the tameness of an old man and the sloth of a young one.\"\r\n\r\nWhile he listened to these and the like suggestions, there escaped him,\r\nno expressions, in truth, of any criminal purpose; but sometimes such as\r\nwere resentful and unguarded: these were catched up by the spies placed\r\nupon him, and charged against him with aggravations; neither was\r\nhe allowed the privilege of clearing himself. Several threatening\r\nappearances moreover dismayed him: some avoided to meet him; others\r\nhaving just paid him the salute, turned instantly away: many, in the\r\nmidst of conversation, broke off and left him; while the creatures of\r\nSejanus stood still fearlessly by and sneered upon him. For Tiberius; he\r\nalways entertained him with a stern face, or a hollow smile; and whether\r\nthe youth spoke or said nothing, there were crimes in his words, crimes\r\nin his silence: nor was he safe even at the dead of night; since his\r\nuneasiness and watchings, nay, his very sighs and dreams were, by his\r\nwife, divulged to her mother Livia, and by Livia to Sejanus; who had\r\nalso drawn his brother Drusus into the combination, by tempting him with\r\nthe immediate prospect of Empire, if his elder brother, already sinking,\r\nwere once set effectually aside. The genius of Druses naturally furious,\r\ninstigated besides by a passion for power, and by the usual hate and\r\ncompetition between brothers, was further kindled by the partiality\r\nof Agrippina, who was fonder of Nero. However, Sejanus did not so far\r\nfavour Drusus, but that against him too he was even then ripening the\r\nstudied measures of future destruction; as he knew him to be violent,\r\nand thence more obnoxious to snares.\r\n\r\nIn the end of the year departed these eminent persons; Asinius Agrippa,\r\nof ancestors more illustrious than ancient, and in his own character\r\nnot unworthy of them: and Quintus Haterius, of a Senatorian family, and\r\nhimself, while he yet lived, famous for eloquence: but the monuments\r\nof his genius, since published, are not equally esteemed. In truth,\r\nhe prevailed more by rapidity than accuracy: insomuch that, as the\r\nelaborate compositions of others flourish after them; so that enchanting\r\nmelody of voice in Haterius, with that fluency of words which was\r\npersonal to him, died with him.\r\n\r\nIn the Consulship of Marcus Licinius and Lucius Calpurnius, the casualty\r\nof an instant, its beginning unforeseen, and ended as soon as begun,\r\nequalled in calamity the slaughter and overthrow of mighty armies. One\r\nAtilius had undertaken to erect an amphitheatre at Fidena, [Footnote:\r\nCastel Giubileo, near Rome.] there to exhibit a combat of gladiators:\r\nhe was of the race of freedmen, and as he began it from no exuberance of\r\nwealth, nor to court popularity amongst the inhabitants, but purely\r\nfor the meanness of gain, he neither established solid foundations, nor\r\nraised the timber-work with sufficient compactness. Thither thronged\r\nfrom Rome those of every sex and age, eager for such shows; as during\r\nthe reign of Tiberius they were debarred from diversions at home; and,\r\nthe nearer the place, the greater the crowds: hence the calamity was the\r\nmore dreadful; for, as the theatre was surcharged with the multitude,\r\nthe structure burst, and sinking violently in, while its extremities\r\nrushed impetuously out, huge was the press of people, who intent upon\r\nthe gladiators within, or gathered round the walls, were crushed by the\r\ndeadly ruin, and even buried under it. And verily, they who in the first\r\nfury of the havoc were smitten with final death, escaped as far as in\r\nsuch a doleful disaster they could escape, the misery of torture: much\r\nmore to be lamented were those, who bereft of joints and pieces of their\r\nbody, were yet not forsaken of life; those who by day could with their\r\neyes behold their wives and children imprisoned in the same ruins; and\r\nby night could distinguish them by their groans, and howlings.\r\n\r\nNow others from abroad excited by the sad tidings, found here their\r\nseveral sorrows: one bewailed his brother, one his kinsman, another his\r\nparents: even they whose friends or kindred were absent on a different\r\naccount, were yet terrified: for, as it was not hitherto distinctly\r\nknown upon whom the destruction had lighted, the dread was widened by\r\nuncertainty. When the ruins began to be removed, great about the dead\r\nwas the concourse of the living; frequent the kisses and embraces\r\nof tenderness and sorrow: and even frequent the contention about the\r\npropriety of the dead; where the features distorted by death or bruises,\r\nor where parity of age or resemblance of person, had confounded the\r\nslain, and led into mistakes their several claimers. Fifty thousand\r\nsouls were destroyed or maimed by this sad stroke: it was therefore\r\nfor the future provided by a decree of Senate, \"that no man under the\r\nqualification of four hundred thousand sesterces, [Footnote: £3,300.]\r\nshould exhibit the spectacle of gladiators; and no amphitheatre should\r\nbe founded but upon ground manifestly solid.\" Atilius was punished with\r\nexile. To conclude; during the fresh pangs of this calamity, the doors\r\nof the Grandees were thrown open; medicines were everywhere furnished;\r\nthey who administered medicines, were everywhere employed to attend:\r\nand at that juncture the city though sorrowful of aspect, seemed to\r\nhave recalled the public spirit of the ancient Romans; who, after great\r\nbattles, constantly relieved the wounded, sustained them by liberality,\r\nand restored them with care.\r\n\r\nThe public agonies from this terrible blow, were not yet deadened, when\r\nanother supervened; and the city felt the affliction and violence of\r\nfire, which with uncommon rage utterly consumed Mount Caelius. \"It was a\r\ndeadly and mournful year,\" they said, \"and under boding omens the\r\nPrince had formed the design of his absence.\" It is the way this of\r\nthe multitude; who to malignant counsels are wont to ascribe events\r\naltogether fortuitous. But the Emperor dissipated their murmurs, by\r\nbestowing on each sufferer money to the value of his sufferings: hence\r\nhe had the thanks of men of rank, in the Senate; and was by the populace\r\nrewarded with applauses, \"for that without the views of ambition,\r\nwithout the application of friends, he had of his own accord even sought\r\nout the unknown, and by his bounty relieved them.\" It was likewise moved\r\nand decreed in Senate, \"that Mount Caelius should be for the future\r\nstyled _Mount Augustus_, since there the statue of Tiberius, standing\r\nin the house of Junius the Senator, escaped unhurt in the flames,\r\nthough devouring all round them:\" it was remembered, that the same rare\r\nexemption had formerly happened to Claudia Pulchra; that her statue\r\nbeing twice spared by the fury of fire, had thence been placed and\r\nconsecrated by our ancestors in the Temple of the Mother of the Gods.\r\nThus sacred were the Claudian race, and dear to the deities; and\r\ntherefore the place, where the Gods had testified such mighty honour\r\ntowards the Prince, ought to be dignified with consecration.\r\n\r\nIt will not be impertinent to insert here, that this mount was of old\r\nnamed _Querquetulanus_, from a grove of oak which grew thick upon it. It\r\nwas afterwards called _Mount Caelius_, from Caeles Vibenna, who having\r\nled to Rome a body of Tuscan auxiliaries, was presented with that\r\nsettlement by Tarquinius Priscus, or some other of our kings; for in\r\nthis particular, writers differ: about other circumstances there remains\r\nno dispute; that these forces were very numerous, and extended their\r\ndwellings all along the plain below, as far as the Forum. Hence the\r\n_Tuscan Street_, so called after these strangers.\r\n\r\nTiberius, having dedicated the temples in Campania; though he had by\r\nan edict warned the public, \"that none should interrupt his quiet;\"\r\nand though soldiers were posted to keep off all confluence from the\r\nneighbouring towns; nevertheless, hating the towns themselves, and\r\nthe colonies, and every part in the continent, imprisoned himself in\r\nCapreae, [Footnote: Capri.] an island disjoined from the point of the\r\nCape of Surrentum by a channel of three miles. I should chiefly believe\r\nthat he was taken with its solitude, as the sea above it is void of\r\nhavens, as the stations for the smallest vessels are few and difficult,\r\nand as none could put in unperceived by the Guards. The genius of\r\nthe climate is mild in winter, from the shelter of a mountain which\r\nintercepts the rigour of the winds: its summers are refreshed by gales\r\nfrom the west; and the sea open all round it, makes a delightful view:\r\nfrom thence too was beheld a most lovely landscape, before the eruptions\r\nof Mount Vesuvius had changed the face of the prospect. It is the\r\ntradition of fame that the Greeks occupied the opposite region, and\r\nthat Capreae was particularly inhabited by the Teleboi. However it were,\r\nTiberius then confined his retirement to twelve villas, their names\r\nfamous of old and their structure sumptuous. And the more intent he had\r\nformerly been upon public cares, he became now so much the more buried\r\nin dark debauches, and resigned over to mischievous privacy: for, there\r\nremained still in him his old bent to suspicions, and rash faith in\r\ninformers; qualities which even at Rome Sejanus had always fostered, and\r\nhere inflamed more vigorously; his devices against Agrippina and Nero\r\nbeing no longer a secret. About them guards were placed, by whom every\r\npetty circumstance, the messages they sent or received, their visits and\r\ncompany, their open behaviour, their private conversation, were all as\r\nit were minuted into journals: there were others, too, instructed to\r\nwarn them to fly to the armies in Germany; or that embracing the statue\r\nof the deified Augustus in the great Forum, they would there implore the\r\naid and protection of the Senate and People of Rome. And these counsels,\r\nthough rejected by them, were fathered and charged upon them, as just\r\nripe for execution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK V\r\n\r\nA.D. 29-31.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Consulship of Rubellius and Fusius, each surnamed Geminus, died\r\nJulia Augusta, the mother of Tiberius, in the extremity of age. She was\r\ndescended from the Claudian house; adopted through her father into the\r\nLivian family; into the Julian, by Augustus; and both by adoption and\r\ndescent, signally noble: her first marriage was with Tiberius Nero; and\r\nby him she had children: her husband, after the surrender of Perusia,\r\n[Footnote: Perugia.] in the Civil War, became a fugitive; but, upon\r\npeace made between Sextus Pompeius and the Triumvirate, returned to\r\nRome. Afterwards, Octavius Caesar smitten with her beauty, snatched\r\nher from her husband; whether with or against her own inclinations, is\r\nuncertain; but with such precipitation, that, without staying for her\r\ndelivery, he married her yet big with child by Tiberius. Henceforward\r\nshe had no issue; but, by the marriage of Germanicus and Agrippina,\r\nher blood came to be mixed with that of Augustus in their\r\ngreat-grandchildren. In her domestic deportment, she conformed to\r\nthe venerable model of antiquity; but with more complaisance than was\r\nallowed by the ladies of old: an easy courteous wife, an ambitious\r\nmother; and well comporting with the nice arts of her husband, and the\r\ndissimulation of her son: her funeral was moderate, and her last will\r\nlay long unfulfilled: her encomium was pronounced in public by Caligula,\r\nher grandson, [Footnote: Great-grandson.] afterwards Emperor.\r\n\r\nTiberius by a letter excused himself to the Senate, for not having paid\r\nhis last offices to his mother; and, though he rioted in private\r\nluxury without abatement, pleaded \"the multitude of public affairs.\"\r\nHe likewise abridged the honours decreed to her memory, and, of a\r\nlarge number, admitted but very few: for this restriction he pretended\r\nmodesty, and added, \"that no religious worship should be appointed her;\r\nfor that the contrary was her own choice.\" Nay, in a part of the same\r\nletter, he censured _feminine friendships_; obliquely upbraiding the\r\nConsul Fusius, a man highly distinguished by the favour of Augusta, and\r\ndexterous to engage and cajole the affections of women; a gay talker,\r\nand one accustomed to play upon Tiberius with biting sarcasms; the\r\nimpressions of which never die in the hearts of Princes.\r\n\r\nFrom this moment, the domination waxed completely outrageous and\r\ndevouring: for while she lived, some refuge still remained, as the\r\nobservance of Tiberius towards his mother was ever inviolate; nor durst\r\nSejanus arrogate precedence of the authority of a parent: but now, as\r\nlet loose from all restraint, they broke out with unbridled fury: so\r\nthat letters were despatched avowedly against Agrippina and Nero; and as\r\nthey were read in the Senate soon after the death of Augusta, the\r\npeople believed them to have been sent before and by her suppressed. The\r\nexpressions were elaborately bitter; and yet by them no hostile purpose\r\nof taking arms, no endeavour to change the State, was objected to the\r\nyouth; but only \"the love of boys, and other impure pleasures:\" against\r\nAgrippina he durst not even feign so much; and therefore arraigned\r\n\"her haughty looks, her impetuous and stubborn spirit.\" The Senate\r\nwere struck with deep silence and affright: but, as particular men will\r\nalways be drawing personal favour from public miseries, there were\r\nsome who, having no hopes founded upon uprightness, demanded that \"they\r\nshould proceed upon the letters:\" amongst these the foremost in zeal was\r\nCotta Messalinus, with a terrible motion: but, the other leading men,\r\nand chiefly the magistrates, were embarrassed by fear: for Tiberius,\r\nthough he had sent them a flaming invective, left all the rest a riddle.\r\n\r\nIn the Senate was one Junius Rusticus, appointed by the Emperor to keep\r\na journal of their proceedings, and therefore thought well acquainted\r\nwith his purposes. This man, by some fatal impulse (for he had never\r\nbefore shown any instance of magnanimity) or blinded by deceitful\r\npolicy, while forgetful of present and impending dangers, he dreaded\r\nfuture possibilities, joined the party that hesitated, and even warned\r\nthe Consuls \"not to begin the debate:\" he argued \"that in a short moment\r\nthe highest affairs might take a new turn: and an interval ought to be\r\nallowed to the old man to change his passion into remorse.\" At the same\r\ntime, the people, carrying with them the images of Agrippina and Nero,\r\ngathered about the Senate, and proclaiming their good wishes for the\r\nprosperity of the Emperor, cried earnestly, \"that the letters were\r\ncounterfeit; and, against the consent of the Prince, the doom of his\r\nfamily was pursued:\" so that nothing tragical was that day transacted.\r\nThere were also dispersed amongst them several speeches, said to have\r\nbeen uttered in Senate by the Consulars, as their motions and advices\r\nagainst Sejanus; but all framed, and with the more petulance as the\r\nseveral authors exercised their satirical wit in the dark. Hence Sejanus\r\nboiled with greater rage, and hence had a handle for branding the\r\nSenate, \"that by them the anguish and resentments of the Prince were\r\ndespised: the people were revolted; popular and disaffected harangues\r\nwere publicly read and listened to: new and arbitrary acts of Senate\r\nwere passed and published: what more remained, but to arm the populace\r\nand place at their head, as leaders and Imperial commanders, those whose\r\nimages they had already chosen for standards?\"\r\n\r\nTiberius having therefore repeated his reproaches against his grandson\r\nand daughter-in-law: having chastised the people by an edict, and\r\ncomplained to the Senate, \"that by the fraud of a single Senator the\r\nImperial dignity should be battled and insulted, required that the whole\r\naffair should be left to himself, entire and untouched.\" The Senate\r\nhesitated no longer, but instantly proceeded, not now in truth to\r\ndecree penalties and capital vengeance; for that was forbid them; but to\r\ntestify \"how ready they were to inflict just punishments, and that they\r\nwere only interrupted by the power and pleasure of the Prince.\"...\r\n\r\n[_Here begins a lamentable chasm in this \"Annal\" for almost three years;\r\nand by it we have lost the detail of the most remarkable incidents in\r\nthis reign, the exile of Agrippina into the Isle of Pandataria; of\r\nNero, into that of Pontia; and the murder of both there by the orders of\r\nTiberius: the conspiracy and execution of Sejanus, with that of all\r\nhis friends and dependents: the further wickedness of Livia, and her\r\ndeath._]\r\n\r\nNow though the rage of the populace was expiring, and though most men\r\nwere mollified by former executions; it was determined to condemn the\r\nother children of Sejanus. They were therefore carried both to prison,\r\nthe boy sensible of his impending doom; but the girl so ignorant, that\r\nshe frequently asked; \"For what offence? and whither did they drag her?\r\nshe would do so no more; and they might take the rod and whip her.\"\r\nThe writers of that time relate, \"that as it was a thing unheard, for\r\na virgin to suffer capital punishment, she was deflowered by the\r\nexecutioner just before he tied the rope; and that being both strangled,\r\nthe tender bodies of these children were cast into the place where the\r\ncarcasses of malefactors are exposed, before they are flung into the\r\nTiber.\"...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VI\r\n\r\nA.D. 32-37.\r\n\r\n\r\nCneius Domitius and Camillus Scribonianus had begun their Consulship,\r\nwhen the Emperor, having crossed the channel between Capreae [Footnote:\r\nCapri.] and Surrentum, [Footnote: Sorrento.] sailed along the shore\r\nof Campania; unresolved whether he should proceed to Rome; or\r\ncounterfeiting a show of coming, because he had determined not to come.\r\nHe often approached to the neighbourhood of the city, and even visited\r\nthe gardens upon the Tiber; but at last resumed his old retirement,\r\nthe gloomy rocks and solitude of the sea, ashamed of his cruelties, and\r\nabominable lusts; in which he rioted so outrageously, that after the\r\nfashion of royal tyrants, the children of ingenuous parentage became the\r\nobjects of his pollution: nor in them was he struck with a lovely face\r\nonly, or the graces of their persons; but in some their amiable and\r\nchildish innocence, in others their nobility and the glory of their\r\nancestors, became the provocatives of his unnatural passion. Then\r\nlikewise were devised the filthy names, till then unknown, of the\r\n_Sellarii_ and _Spintriae_, expressing the odious lewdness of the place,\r\nand the manifold postures and methods of prostitution practised in it.\r\nFor supplying his lust with these innocent victims, he entertained, in\r\nhis service professed procurers, to look them out and carry them off.\r\nThe willing they encouraged with presents, the backward they terrified\r\nwith threats; and upon such parents or kindred as withheld the infants,\r\nthey exercised force, seizure, and, as upon so many captives, every\r\nspecies of licentious rage.\r\n\r\nAt Rome in the beginning of the year, as if the iniquities of Livia\r\nhad been but just discovered, and not even long since punished, furious\r\norders were passed against her statues too, and memory; with another,\r\n\"that the effects of Sejanus should be taken from the public treasury,\r\nand placed in that of the Emperor:\" as if this vain translation could\r\nany wise avail the State. And yet such was the motion of these great\r\nnames, the Scipios, the Silani, and the Cassii; who urged it, each\r\nalmost in the same words, but all with mighty zeal and earnestness: when\r\nall on a sudden, Togonius Gallus, while he would be thrusting his own\r\nmeanness amongst names so greatly illustrious, became the object of\r\nderision: for he besought the Prince \"to choose a body of Senators\r\nof whom twenty, drawn by lot and under arms, should wait upon him and\r\ndefend his person, as often as he entered the Senate.\" He had been weak\r\nenough to credit a letter from the Emperor, requiring \"the guard and\r\nprotection of one of the Consuls, that he might return in safety from\r\nCapreae to Rome.\" Tiberius however returned thanks to the Senate for\r\nsuch an instance of affection; but as he was wont to mix pleasantry with\r\nthings serious, he asked, \"How was it to be executed? what Senators were\r\nto be chosen? who to be omitted? whether always the same, or a continued\r\nsuccession? whether young Senators, or such as had borne dignities?\r\nwhether those who were Magistrates, or those exercising no magistracy?\r\nmoreover what a becoming figure they would make, grave Senators, men of\r\nthe gown, under arms at the entrance of the Senate! in truth he held not\r\nhis life of such importance, to have it thus protected by arms.\" So much\r\nin answer to Togonius, without asperity of words; nor did he farther,\r\nthan this, press them to cancel the motion.\r\n\r\nBut Junius Gallio escaped not thus. He had proposed \"that the Praetorian\r\nsoldiers, having accomplished their term of service, should thence\r\nacquire the privilege of sitting in the fourteen rows of the theatre\r\nallotted to the Roman knights.\" Upon him Tiberius fell with violent\r\nwrath, and, as if present, demanded, what business had he with the\r\nsoldiers? men whose duty bound them to observe only the orders of the\r\nEmperor, and from the Emperor alone to receive their rewards. Gallio had\r\nforsooth discovered a recompense which had escaped the sagacity of the\r\ndeified Augustus? Or was it not rather a project started by a mercenary\r\nof Sejanus, to raise sedition and discord; a project tending to debauch\r\nthe rude minds of the soldiers with the show and bait of new honour; to\r\ncorrupt their discipline, and set them loose from military restrictions?\r\nThis reward, had the studied flattery of Gallio; who was instantly\r\nexpelled the Senate, and then Italy: nay, it became a charge upon him,\r\nthat his exile would be too easy, having for the place of it chosen\r\nLesbos, an island noble and delightful; he was therefore haled back to\r\nRome and confined a prisoner in the house of a Magistrate. Tiberius\r\nin the same letter demanded the doom of Sextus Paconianus, formerly\r\nPraetor, to the extreme joy of the Senate, as he was a man bold and\r\nmischievous, one armed with snares, and continually diving into the\r\npurposes and secret transactions of all men; and one chosen by Sejanus,\r\nfor plotting the overthrow of Caligula. When this was now laid open,\r\nthe general hate and animosities long since conceived against him, broke\r\nviolently out, and had he not offered to make a discovery, he had been\r\ninstantly condemned to death.\r\n\r\nThe next impeached was Cotta Messalinus, the author of every the\r\nmost bloody counsel, and thence long and intensely hated. The first\r\nopportunity was therefore snatched to fall upon him with a combination\r\nof crimes; as that he had called Caius Caligula by the feminine name of\r\n_Caia Caligula_, and branded him with constuprations of both kinds; that\r\nwhen he celebrated among the Priests the birthday of Augusta, he had\r\nstyled the entertainment a _funeral supper_; and that complaining of the\r\ngreat sway of Marcus Lepidus, and of Lucius Arruntius, with whom he had\r\na suit about money, he had added; \"they indeed will be supported by the\r\nSenate, but I by my little Tiberius.\" [Footnote: Tiberiolus meus.] Of\r\nall this he stood exposed to conviction by men of the first rank in\r\nRome; who being earnest to attack him, he appealed to Caesar: from whom\r\nsoon after a letter was brought in behalf of Cotta; in it he recounted\r\n\"the beginning of their friendship,\" repeated \"his many good services\r\nto himself,\" and desired \"that words perversely construed, and humorous\r\ntales told at an entertainment, might not be wrested into crimes.\"\r\n\r\nMost remarkable was the beginning of that letter; for in these words he\r\nintroduced it: \"What to write you, Conscript Fathers, or in what\r\nmanner to write, or what at all not to write at this instant; if I can\r\ndetermine, may all the Deities, Gods and Goddesses, doom me still\r\nto more cruel agonies than those under which I feel myself perishing\r\ndaily.\" So closely did the bloody horror of his cruelties and infamy\r\nhaunt this man of blood, and became his torturers! Nor was it at random\r\nwhat the wisest of all men [Footnote: Socrates.] was wont to affirm,\r\nthat if the hearts of tyrants were displayed, in them might be seen\r\ndeadly wounds and gorings, and all the butcheries of fear and rage;\r\nseeing what the severity of stripes is to the body, the same to the\r\nsoul is the bitter anguish of cruelty, lust, and execrable pursuits.\r\nTo Tiberius not his imperial fortune, not his gloomy and inaccessible\r\nsolitudes could ensure tranquillity; nor exempt him from feeling and\r\neven avowing the rack in his breast and the avenging furies that pursued\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAfter this, it was left to the discretion of the Senate to proceed as\r\nthey listed against Caecilianus the Senator, \"who had loaded Cotta with\r\nmany imputations;\" and it was resolved, \"to subject him to the same\r\npenalties inflicted upon Aruseius and Sanquinius, the accusers of\r\nLucius Annuntius.\" A more signal instance of honour than this had never\r\nbefallen Cotta; who noble in truth, but through luxury indigent, and,\r\nfor the baseness of his crimes, detestable, was by the dignity of\r\nthis amends equalled in character to the most venerable reputation and\r\nvirtues of Arruntius.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time died Lucius Piso, the Pontiff; and, by a felicity,\r\nthen rare in so much splendour and elevation, died by the course of\r\nnature. The author he never himself was of any servile motion, and ever\r\nwise in moderating such motions from others, where necessity enforced\r\nhis assent. That his father had sustained the sublime office of Censor,\r\nI have before remembered: he himself lived to fourscore years, and for\r\nhis warlike feats in Thrace, had obtained the glory of triumph. But from\r\nhence arose his most distinguished glory, that being created Governor\r\nof Rome, a jurisdiction newly instituted, and the more difficult, as\r\nnot yet settled into public reverence, he tempered it wonderfully and\r\npossessed it long.\r\n\r\nFor, of old, to supply the absence of the Kings, and afterwards of the\r\nConsuls, that the city might not remain without a ruler, a temporary\r\nMagistrate was appointed to administer justice, and watch over\r\nexigencies: and it is said that by Romulus was deputed Denter Romulius;\r\nNuma Marcius, by Tullus Hostilius; and by Tarquin the Proud, Spurius\r\nLucretius. The same delegation was made by the Consuls; and there\r\nremains still a shadow of the old institution, when during the Latin\r\nfestival, one is authorised to discharge the Consular function.\r\nMoreover, Augustus during the Civil Wars, committed to Cilnius Maecenas\r\nof the Equestrian Order, the Government of Rome and of all Italy.\r\nAfterwards, when sole master of the Empire, and moved by the immense\r\nmultitude of people and the slowness of relief from the laws, he chose\r\na Consular to bridle the licentiousness of the slaves, and to awe such\r\nturbulent citizens as are only quiet from the dread of chastisement.\r\nMessala Corvinus was the first invested with this authority, and in a\r\nfew days dismissed, as a man insufficient to discharge it. It was then\r\nfilled by Taurus Statilius, who, though very ancient, sustained it with\r\nsignal honour. After him Piso held it for twenty years, with a credit so\r\nhigh and uninterrupted, that he was distinguished with a public funeral,\r\nby decree of the Senate.\r\n\r\nA motion was thereafter made in Senate by Quinctilianus, Tribune of the\r\nPeople, concerning a Book of the Sibyl, which Caninius Gallus, one\r\nof the College of Fifteen, had prayed \"might be received by a decree\r\namongst the rest of that Prophetess.\" The decree passed without\r\nopposition, but was followed by letters from Tiberius. In them having\r\ngently chid the Tribune, \"as young and therefore unskilled in the\r\nancient usages,\" he upbraided Gallus, \"that he who was so long practised\r\nin the science of sacred ceremonies, should without taking the opinion\r\nof his own college, without the usual reading and deliberation with\r\nthe other Priests, deal, by surprise, with a thin Senate, to admit a\r\nprophetic book of an uncertain author.\" He also advertised them \"of\r\nthe conduct of Augustus, who, to suppress the multitude of fictious\r\npredictions everywhere published under the solemn name of the Sibyl, had\r\nordained, that within a precise day, they should be carried to the City\r\nPraetor; and made it unlawful to keep them in private hands.\" The same\r\nhad likewise been decreed by our ancestors, when after the burning of\r\nthe capitol in the Social War, the Rhymes of the Sibyl (whether there\r\nwere but one, or more) were everywhere sought, in Samos, Ilium, and\r\nErythrae, through Africa too and Sicily and all the Roman colonies, with\r\ninjunctions to the Priests, that, as far as human wit could enable them,\r\nthey would separate the genuine. Therefore, upon this occasion also, the\r\nbook was subjected to the inspection of the Quindecimvirate.\r\n\r\nUnder the same Consuls, the dearth of corn had nigh raised a sedition.\r\nThe populace for many days urged their wants and demands in the public\r\ntheatre, with a licentiousness towards the Emperor, higher than usual.\r\nHe was alarmed with this bold spirit, and censured the Magistrates and\r\nSenate, \"that they had not by the public authority quelled the people.\"\r\nHe recounted \"the continued supplies of grain which he had caused to be\r\nimported; from what provinces, and in how much greater abundance than\r\nthose procured by Augustus.\" So that for correcting the populace,\r\na decree passed framed in the strain of ancient severity: nor less\r\nvigorous was the edict published by the Consuls. His own silence, which\r\nhe hoped would be taken by the people as an instance of moderation, was\r\nby them imputed to his pride.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, the whole band of accusers broke loose upon those who\r\naugmented their wealth by usury, in contradiction to a law of Caesar\r\nthe Dictator, \"for ascertaining the terms of lending money, and holding\r\nmortgages in Italy;\" a law waxed long since obsolete, through the\r\nselfish passions of men, sacrificing public good to private gain. Usury\r\nwas, in truth, an inveterate evil in Rome, and the eternal cause of\r\ncivil discord and seditions, and therefore restrained even in ancient\r\ntimes, while the public manners were not yet greatly corrupted. For,\r\nfirst it was ordained by a law of the twelve tables, \"that no man should\r\ntake higher interest than twelve in the hundred;\" when, before, it was\r\nexacted at the pleasure of the rich. Afterwards by a regulation of the\r\nTribunes it was reduced to six, and at last was quite abolished. By the\r\npeople, too, repeated statutes were made, for obviating all elusions,\r\nwhich by whatever frequent expedients repressed, were yet through\r\nwonderful devices still springing up afresh. Gracchus the Praetor was\r\ntherefore now appointed to inquire into the complaints and allegations\r\nof the accusers; but, appalled with the multitude of those threatened\r\nby the accusation, he had recourse to the Senate. The Fathers also were\r\ndismayed (for of this fault not a soul was guiltless) and sought and\r\nobtained impunity from the Prince; and a year and six months were\r\ngranted for balancing all accounts between debtors and creditors,\r\nagreeably to the direction of the law.\r\n\r\nHence a great scarcity of money: for, besides that all debts were at\r\nonce called in; so many delinquents were condemned, that by the sale of\r\ntheir effects, the current coin was swallowed up in the public treasury,\r\nor in that of the Emperor. Against this stagnation, the Senate had\r\nprovided, \"that two-thirds of the debts should by every creditor be\r\nlaid out upon lands in Italy.\" But the creditors warned in the whole;\r\n[Footnote: Demanded payment in full.] nor could the debtors without\r\nbreach of faith divide the payment. So that at first, meetings and\r\nentreaties were tried; and at last it was contested before the Praetor.\r\nAnd the project applied as a remedy; namely, that the debtor should\r\nsell, and the creditor buy, had a contrary operation: for the usurers\r\nhoarded up all their treasure for purchasing of lands, and the plenty\r\nof estates to be sold, miserably sinking the price; the more men were\r\nindebted, the more difficult they found it to sell. Many were utterly\r\nstripped of their fortunes; and the ruin of their private patrimony drew\r\nheadlong with it that of their reputation and all public preferment.\r\nThe destruction was going on, when the Emperor administered relief, by\r\nlending a hundred thousand great sesterces [Footnote: About £830,000.]\r\nfor three years, without interest; provided each borrower pawned to the\r\npeople double the value in inheritance. [Footnote: Gave a security to\r\nthe State, on landed property.] Thus was credit restored; and by degrees\r\nprivate lenders too were found.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time, Claudia, daughter to Marcus Silanus, was given in\r\nmarriage to Caligula, who had accompanied his grandfather to Capreae,\r\nhaving always hid under a subdolous guise of modesty, his savage and\r\ninhuman spirit: even upon the condemnation of his mother, even for the\r\nexile of his brothers, not a word escaped him, not a sigh, nor groan.\r\nSo blindly observant of Tiberius, that he studied the bent of his temper\r\nand seemed to possess it; practised his looks, imitated the change and\r\nfashion of his dress, and affected his words and manner of expression.\r\nHence the observation of Passienus the Orator, grew afterwards famous,\r\n\"that never lived a better slave nor a worse master.\" Neither would I\r\nomit the presage of Tiberius concerning Galba, then Consul. Having sent\r\nfor him and sifted him upon several subjects, he at last told him in\r\nGreek, \"and thou, Galba, shalt hereafter taste of Empire;\" signifying\r\nhis late and short sovereignty. This he uttered from his skill in\r\nastrology, which at Rhodes he had leisure to learn; and Thrasullus for\r\nhis teacher, whose capacity he proved by this following trial.\r\n\r\nAs often as he consulted this way concerning any affair, he retired to\r\nthe roof of the house, attended by one freedman trusted with the secret.\r\nThis man strong of body, but destitute of letters, guided along the\r\nastrologer, whose art Tiberius meant to try, over solitary precipices\r\n(for upon a rock the house stood) and, as he returned, if any suspicion\r\narose that his predictions were vain, or that the author designed fraud,\r\ncast him headlong into the sea, to prevent his making discoveries.\r\nThrasullus being therefore led over the same rocks, and minutely\r\nconsulted, his answers were full, and struck Tiberius; as approaching\r\nEmpire and many future revolutions were specifically foretold him. The\r\nartist was then questioned, \"whether he had calculated his own nativity,\r\nand thence presaged what was to befall him that same year, nay,\r\nthat very day?\" Thrasullus surveying the positions of the stars, and\r\ncalculating their aspects, began at first to hesitate, then to quake,\r\nand the more he meditated, being more and more dismayed with wonder\r\nand dread, he at last cried out, \"that over him just then hung a\r\nboding danger and well-nigh fatal.\" Forthwith Tiberius embraced him,\r\ncongratulated him \"upon his foresight of perils, and his security\r\nfrom them;\" and esteeming his predictions as so many oracles, held him\r\nthenceforward in the rank of his most intimate friends.\r\n\r\nFor myself, while I listen to these and the like relations, my judgment\r\nwavers, whether things human are in their course and rotation determined\r\nby Fate and immutable necessity, or left to roll at random. For upon\r\nthis subject the wisest of the ancients and those addicted to their\r\nSects, are of opposite sentiments. [Footnote: The Epicureans.] Many are\r\nof opinion \"that to the Gods neither the generation of us men nor our\r\ndeath, and in truth neither men nor the actions of men, are of any\r\nimportance or concernment: and thence such numberless calamities afflict\r\nthe upright, while pleasure and prosperity surround the wicked.\" Others\r\n[Footnote: The Stoics.] hold the contrary position, and believe \"a Fate\r\nto preside over events; a fate however not resulting from wandering\r\nstars, but coeval with the first principles of things, and operating by\r\nthe continued connection of natural causes. Yet their philosophy leaves\r\nour course of life in our own free option; but that after the choice is\r\nmade, the chain of consequences is inevitable: neither is that good or\r\nevil, which passes for such in the estimation of the vulgar: many, who\r\nseem wounded with adversity, are yet happy; numbers, that wallow\r\nin wealth, are yet most wretched: since the first often bear with\r\nmagnanimity the blows of fortune; and the latter abuse her bounty in\r\nbaneful pursuits.\" For the rest, it is common to multitudes of men \"to\r\nhave each their whole future fortunes determined from the moment of\r\ntheir birth: or if some events thwart the prediction, it is through the\r\nmistakes of such as pronounce at random, and thence debase the credit\r\nof an art, which, both in ages past and our own, hath given signal\r\ninstances of its certainty.\" For, to avoid lengthening this digression,\r\nI shall remember in its order, how by the son of this same Thrasullus\r\nthe Empire was predicted to Nero.\r\n\r\nDuring the same Consulship flew abroad the death of Asinius Gallus: that\r\nhe perished through famine was undoubted; but whether of his own accord,\r\nor by constraint, was held uncertain. The pleasure of the Emperor\r\nbeing consulted, \"whether he would suffer him to be buried;\" he was\r\nnot ashamed to grant such a piece of mock mercy, nor even to blame the\r\nanticipations of casualty, which had withdrawn the criminal, before he\r\nwas publicly convicted: as if during three intermediate years between\r\nhis accusation and his death, there wanted time for the trial of an\r\nancient Consular, and the father of so many Consulars. Next perished\r\nDrusus, condemned by his grandfather to be starved; but by gnawing the\r\nweeds upon which he lay, he by that miserable nourishment protracted\r\nlife the space of nine days. Some authors relate that, in case Sejanus\r\nhad resisted and taken arms, Macro had instructions to draw the young\r\nman out of confinement (for he was kept in the palace) and set him\r\nat the head of the people: afterwards because a report ran, \"that the\r\nEmperor was about to be reconciled to his daughter-in-law and grandson;\"\r\nhe chose rather to gratify himself by cruelty, than the public by\r\nrelenting.\r\n\r\nTiberius not satiated with the death of Drusus, even after death pursued\r\nhim with cruel invectives, and, in a letter to the Senate, charged him\r\nwith \"a body foul with prostitution; with a spirit breathing destruction\r\nto his own family, and rage against the Republic;\" and ordered to be\r\nrecited \"the minutes of his words and actions, which had been long and\r\ndaily registered,\" A proceeding more black with horror could not\r\nbe devised! That for so many years, there should be those expressly\r\nappointed, who were to note down his looks, his groans, his secret\r\nand extorted murmurs; that his grandfather should delight to hear the\r\ntreacherous detail, to read it, and to the public expose it, would\r\nappear a series of fraud, meanness and amazement beyond all measure of\r\nfaith, were it not for the letters of Actius the Centurion, and Didymus\r\nthe Freedman; who in them declare, particularly, the names of the slaves\r\nset purposely to abuse and provoke Drusus, with the several parts they\r\nacted; how one struck him going out of his chamber, and how another\r\nfilled him with terrors and dismay. The Centurion too repeated, as\r\nmatter of glory, his own language to Drusus, language full of outrage\r\nand barbarity, with the words uttered by him under the agonies of\r\nfamine; that, at first, feigning disorder of spirit, he vented, in the\r\nstyle of a madman, dismal denunciations against Tiberius; but after\r\nall hopes of life had forsaken him, then, in steady and deliberate\r\nimprecations, he invoked the direful vengeance of the Gods, \"that as he\r\nhad slaughtered his son's wife, slaughtered the son of his brother, and\r\nhis son's sons, and with slaughters had filled his own house; so they\r\nwould in justice to the ancestors of the slain, in justice to their\r\nposterity, doom him to the dreadful penalties of so many murders.\"\r\nThe Senators, in truth, upon this raised a mighty din, under colour of\r\ndetesting these imprecations: but it was dread which possessed them,\r\nand amazement, that he who had been once so dark in the practice of\r\nwickedness, and so subtle in the concealment of his bloody spirit, was\r\narrived at such an utter insensibility of shame, that he could thus\r\nremove, as it were, the covert of the walls, and represent his own\r\ngrandson under the ignominious chastisement of a Centurion, torn by the\r\nbarbarous stripes of slaves, and imploring in vain the last sustenance\r\nof life.\r\n\r\nBefore the impressions of this grief were worn away, the death of\r\nAgrippina was published. I suppose she had lived thus long upon the\r\nhopes, which from the execution of Sejanus she had conceived; but,\r\nfeeling afterwards no relaxation of cruelty, death grew her choice:\r\nunless she were bereaved of nourishment, and her decease feigned to have\r\nbeen of her own seeking. For, Tiberius raged against her with abominable\r\nimputations, reproaching her \"with lewdness; as the adulteress of\r\nAsinius Gallus; and that upon his death she became weary of life.\" But\r\nthese were none of her crimes: Agrippina impatient of an equal lot,\r\nand eager for rule, had thence sacrificed to masculine ambition all the\r\npassions and vices of women. The Emperor added, \"that she departed the\r\nsame day on which Sejanus had suffered as a traitor two years before,\r\nand that the same ought to be perpetuated by a public memorial.\" Nay,\r\nhe boasted of his clemency, in \"that she had not been strangled, and her\r\nbody cast into the charnel of malefactors.\" For this, as for an instance\r\nof mercy the Senate solemnly thanked him, and decreed \"that, on the\r\nseventeenth of October, the day of both their deaths, a yearly offering\r\nshould be consecrated to Jupiter for ever.\"\r\n\r\nNot long after, Cocceius Nerva, in full prosperity of fortune, in\r\nperfect vigour of body, formed a purpose of dying. As he was the\r\nincessant companion of the Prince, and accomplished in the knowledge\r\nof all laws divine and humane, Tiberius having learnt his design, was\r\nearnest to dissuade him, examined his motives, joined entreaties, and\r\neven declared, \"how grievous to his own spirit it would prove, how\r\ngrievous to his reputation, if the nearest of his friends should\r\nrelinquish life, without any cause for dying.\" Nerva rejected his\r\nreasoning, and completed his purpose by abstinence. It was alleged, by\r\nsuch as knew his thoughts, that the more he saw into the dreadful source\r\nand increase of public miseries, the more transported with indignation\r\nand fear, he resolved to make an honest end, in the bloom of his\r\nintegrity, e'er his life and credit were assaulted. Moreover the fall of\r\nAgrippina, by a reverse hardly credible, procured that of Plancina. She\r\nwas formerly married to Cneius Piso; and, though she exulted publicly\r\nfor the death of Germanicus, yet when Piso fell, she was protected\r\nby the solicitations of Augusta, nor less by the known animosity of\r\nAgrippina. But as favour and hate were now withdrawn, justice prevailed,\r\nand being questioned for crimes long since sufficiently manifest, she\r\nexecuted with her own hand that vengeance, which was rather too slow\r\nthan too severe,\r\n\r\nIn the Consulship of Paulus Fabius and Lucius Vitellius, after a long\r\nvicissitude of ages, the phoenix arrived in Egypt, and furnished the\r\nmost learned of the natives and Greeks with matter of large and various\r\nobservations concerning that miraculous bird. The circumstances in which\r\nthey agree, with many others, that, however disputed, deserve to be\r\nknown, claim a recital here. That it is a creature sacred to the sun,\r\nand in the fashion of its head, and diversity of feathers, distinct from\r\nother birds, all who have described its figure, are agreed; about the\r\nlength of its life, relations vary. It is by the vulgar tradition\r\nfixed at five hundred years: but there are those, who extend it to one\r\nthousand four hundred and sixty-one; and assert that the three former\r\nphoenixes appeared in reigns greatly distant, the first under Sesostris,\r\nthe next under Amasis; and that one was seen under Ptolomy the\r\nthird King of Egypt of the Macedonian race, and flew to the city of\r\nHeliopolis, accompanied by a vast host of other birds gazing upon the\r\nwonderful stranger. But these are, in truth, the obscure accounts of\r\nantiquity: between Ptolomy and Tiberius the interval was shorter, not\r\ntwo hundred and fifty years: hence some have believed that the present\r\nwas a spurious phoenix, and derived not its origin from the territories\r\nof Arabia, since it observed nothing of the instinct which ancient\r\ntradition attributes to the genuine: for that the latter having\r\ncompleted his course of years, just before his death builds a nest\r\nin his native land, and upon it sheds a generative power, from whence\r\narises a young one, whose first care, when he is grown, is to bury his\r\nfather: neither does he undertake it unadvisedly, but by collecting and\r\nfetching loads of myrrh, tries his strength in great journeys; and\r\nas soon as he finds himself equal to the burden, and fit for the long\r\nflight, he rears upon his back his father's body, carries it quite to\r\nthe altar of the sun, and then flies away. These are uncertain tales,\r\nand their uncertainty heightened by fables; but that this bird has been\r\nsometimes seen in Egypt, is not questioned.\r\n\r\nThe same year the city suffered the grievous calamity of fire, which\r\nburnt down that part of the Circus contiguous to Mount Aventine and the\r\nMount itself: a loss which turned to the glory of the Prince, as he paid\r\nin money the value of the houses destroyed. A hundred thousand great\r\nsesterces [Footnote: About £830,000.] he expended in this bounty, which\r\nproved the more grateful to the people as he was ever sparing in private\r\nbuildings: in truth, his public works never exceeded two, the Temple of\r\nAugustus and the scene [Footnote: The stage.] of Pompey's Theatre; nor,\r\nwhen he had finished both, did he dedicate either, whether obstructed\r\nby old age, or despising popularity. For ascertaining the damage of\r\nparticulars, the four sons-in-law of Tiberius were appointed, Cneius\r\nDomitius, Cassius Longinus, Marcus Vincinus and Rubellius Blandus;\r\nassisted by Publius Petronius, nominated by the Consuls. To the Emperor\r\nlikewise were decreed several honours, variously devised according to\r\nthe different drift and genius of such as proposed them. Which of these\r\nhe meant to accept, or which to reject, the approaching issue of his\r\ndays, has buried in uncertainty. For not long after, Cneius Acerronius\r\nand Caius Pontius commenced Consuls; the last under Tiberius. The power\r\nof Macro was already excessive; who, as he had at no time neglected the\r\nfavour of Caligula, courted it now more and more earnestly every day.\r\nAfter the death of Claudia, whom I have mentioned to have been espoused\r\nto the young Prince, he constrained Ennia his own wife to stimulate the\r\naffections of Caligula and to secure him by a promise of marriage.\r\nThe truth is, he was one that denied nothing that opened his way to\r\nsovereignty; for although of a tempestuous genius, he had yet in the\r\nschool of his grandfather, well acquired all the hollow guises of\r\ndissimulation.\r\n\r\nHis spirit was known to the Emperor; hence he was puzzled about\r\nbequeathing the Empire: and first as to his grandsons; the son of Drusus\r\nwas nearer in blood, and dearer in point of affection, but as yet a\r\nchild; the son of Germanicus had arrived at the vigour of youth, and the\r\nzeal of the people followed him, a motive this to his grandfather,\r\nonly to hate him. He had even debates with himself concerning Claudius,\r\nbecause of solid age and naturally inclined to honest pursuits; but\r\nthe defect of his faculties withstood the choice. In case he sought\r\na successor apart from his own family, he dreaded lest the memory of\r\nAugustus, lest the name of the Caesars should come to be scorned and\r\ninsulted. For, it was not so much any study of his, to gratify the\r\npresent generation and secure the Roman State, as to perpetuate to\r\nposterity the grandeur of his race. So that his mind still wavering and\r\nhis strength decaying, to the decision of fortune he permitted a counsel\r\nto which he was now unequal. Yet he dropped certain words whence might\r\nbe gathered that he foresaw the events and revolutions which were to\r\ncome to pass after him: for, he upbraided Macro, by no dark riddle,\r\n\"that he forsook the setting sun and courted the rising:\" and of\r\nCaligula, who upon some occasional discourse ridiculed Sylla, he\r\nforetold, \"that he would have all Sylla's vices, and not one of his\r\nvirtues.\" Moreover, as he was, with many tears, embracing the younger of\r\nhis grandsons, and perceived the countenance of Caligula implacable and\r\nprovoked; \"thou,\" said he, \"wilt slay him, and another shall slay thee.\"\r\nBut, however his illness prevailed, he relinquished nothing of his vile\r\nvoluptuousness; forcing patience, and feigning health. He was wont too\r\nto ridicule the prescriptions of physicians, and all men who, after the\r\nage of thirty, needed to be informed by any one else, what helped or\r\nhurted their constitutions.\r\n\r\nAt Rome, the while, were sown the sanguinary seeds of executions to be\r\nperpetrated even after Tiberius. Laelius Balbus had with high treason\r\ncharged Acutia, some time the wife of Publius Vitellius; and, as the\r\nSenate were, after her condemnation, decreeing a reward to the accuser,\r\nthe same was obstructed by the interposition of Junius Otho, Tribune of\r\nthe People: hence their mutual hate, which ended in the exile of Otho.\r\nThereafter Albucilla, who had been married to Satrius Secundus, him that\r\nrevealed the conspiracy of Sejanus, and herself famous for many amours,\r\nwas impeached of impious rites devised against the Prince. In the charge\r\nwere involved, as her associates and adulterers, Cneius Domitius, Vibius\r\nMarsus, and Lucius Arruntius. The noble descent of Domitius I have above\r\ndeclared: Marsus too was distinguished by the ancient dignities in\r\nhis house, and himself illustrious for learning. The minutes, however,\r\ntransmitted to the Senate imported, \"that in the examination of the\r\nwitnesses, and torture of the slaves, Macro had presided:\" neither came\r\nthese minutes accompanied with any letter from the Emperor against the\r\naccused. Hence it was suspected, that, while he was ill, and perhaps\r\nwithout his privacy, the accusations were in great measure forged by\r\nMacro, in consequence of his notorious enmity to Arruntius.\r\n\r\nDomitius therefore by preparing for his defence, and Marsus by seeming\r\ndetermined to famish, both protracted their lives. Arruntius chose to\r\ndie; and to the importunity of his friends, urging him to try delays and\r\nevasions, he answered, \"that the same measures were not alike honourable\r\nto all men: his own life was abundantly long; nor had he wherewithal to\r\nreproach himself, save that he had submitted to bear thus far an old age\r\nloaded with anxieties, exposed to daily dangers, and the cruel sport\r\nof power; long hated as he was by Sejanus, now by Macro, always by\r\nsome reigning minister; hated through no fault of his own, but as one\r\nirreconcilable to baseness and the iniquities of power. He might, in\r\ntruth, outlive and avoid the few and last days of Tiberius: but how\r\nescape the youth of his heir? If upon Tiberius at such an age, and after\r\nsuch consummate experience, the violent spirit of unbridled dominion had\r\nwrought with such efficacy, as entirely to transport and change him;\r\nwas it likely that Caligula, he who had scarce outgrown his childhood,\r\na youth ignorant of all things, or nursed and principled in the worst,\r\nwould follow a course more righteous under the guidance of Macro; the\r\nsame Macro, who, for destroying Sejanus, was employed as the more wicked\r\nof the two, and had since by more mischiefs and cruelties torn and\r\nafflicted the Commonweal? For himself; he foresaw a servitude yet more\r\nvehement, and therefore withdrew at once from the agonies of past and of\r\nimpending tyranny.\" Uttering these words, with the spirit of a prophet,\r\nhe opened his veins. How wisely Arruntius anticipated death, the\r\nfollowing times will terribly demonstrate. For Albucilla; she aimed at\r\nher own life, but the blow being impotent, she was by order of Senate\r\ndragged to execution in the prison. Against the ministers of her lusts\r\nit was decreed, \"that Grasidius Sacerdos, formerly Praetor, should be\r\nexiled into an island; Pontius Fregellanus be degraded from the Senate;\r\nand that upon Laelius Balbus the same penalty be inflicted:\" his\r\npunishment particularly proved matter of joy, as he was accounted a man\r\nof pestilent eloquence, and prompt to attack the innocent.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time, Sextus Papinius of a Consular family, chose on a\r\nsudden a frightful end, by a desperate and precipitate fall. The cause\r\nwas ascribed to his mother, who, after many repulses, had by various\r\nallurements and the stimulations of sensuality, urged him to practices\r\nand embarrassments from whence, only by dying, he could devise an issue.\r\nShe was therefore accused in the Senate; and, though in a prostrate\r\nposture she embraced the knees of the Fathers, and pleaded \"the\r\ntenderness and grief of a mother, the imbecility of a woman's spirit\r\nunder such an affecting calamity;\" with other motives of pity in the\r\nsame doleful strain; she was banished Rome for ten years, till her\r\nyounger son were past the age of lubricity.\r\n\r\nAs to Tiberius; already his body, already his spirits failed him; but\r\nhis dissimulation failed him not. He exerted the same vigour of mind,\r\nthe same energy in his looks and discourse; and even sometimes studied\r\nto be gay, by it to hide his declension however notorious. So that,\r\nafter much shifting of places, he settled at the Promontory of Misenum,\r\nin a villa of which Lucullus was once Lord. There it was discovered that\r\nhis end was at hand, by this device. In his train was a physician, his\r\nname Charicles, signal in his profession, one, in truth, not employed to\r\ngovern the Prince's health, but wont however to afford his counsel and\r\nskill. Charicles, as if he were departing to attend his own affairs,\r\nunder the appearance of paying duty and kissing his hands, touched his\r\npulse. But the artifice beguiled not Tiberius; for he instantly ordered\r\nthe entertainment to be served up; whether incensed, and thence the more\r\nsmothering his wrath, is uncertain: but, at table he continued beyond\r\nhis wont, as if he meant that honour only for a farewell to his friend.\r\nBut for all this Charicles satisfied Macro, \"that the flame of life was\r\nexpiring, and could not outlast two days.\" Hence the whole court was\r\nfilled with close consultations, and expresses were despatched to the\r\ngenerals and armies. On the 16th of March, so deep a swoon seized him,\r\nthat he was believed to have paid the last debt of mortality:\r\ninsomuch that Caligula, in the midst of a great throng, paying their\r\ncongratulations, was already appearing abroad, to assume the first\r\noffices of sovereignty, when sudden notice came, \"that Tiberius had\r\nrecovered his sight and voice, and, to strengthen his fainting spirits,\r\nhad called for some refreshment.\" Hence dread seized all, and the whole\r\nconcourse about Caligula dispersed, every man resuming false sorrow, or\r\nfeigning ignorance: he himself was struck speechless, and thus fallen\r\nfrom the highest hopes, waited for present death. Macro continued\r\nundismayed, and ordering the apartment to be cleared, caused the\r\nfeeble old man to be smothered with a weight of coverings. Thus expired\r\nTiberius in the seventy-eighth year of his age.\r\n\r\nHe was the son of Nero, and on both sides a branch of the Claudian\r\nHouse; though his mother had been ingrafted by adoptions into the\r\nLivian, and next into the Julian stock. From his first infancy, his life\r\nwas chequered by various turns and perils: for, then he followed, like\r\nan exile, his proscribed father; and when taken in quality of a step-son\r\ninto the family of Augustus, he long struggled there with many potent\r\nrivals, during the lives of Marcellus and Agrippa; next of the young\r\nCaesars, Caius and Lucius. His brother Drusus too eclipsed him, and\r\npossessed more eminently the hearts of the Roman People. But above all,\r\nhis marriage with Julia, most egregiously threatened and distressed\r\nhim; whether he bore the prostitutions of his wife, or relinquished\r\nthe daughter of Augustus. Upon his return thereafter from Rhodes, he\r\noccupied for twelve years the Prince's family, now bereft of heirs, and\r\nnigh four-and-twenty ruled the Roman State. His manners also varied with\r\nthe several junctures of his fortune: he was well esteemed while yet\r\na private man; and, in discharging public dignities under Augustus, of\r\nsignal reputation: covert and subdolous in feigning virtue so long\r\nas Germanicus and Drusus survived: a mixed character of good and evil\r\nduring the days of his mother: detestably cruel; but secret in his\r\nlewdness, while he loved or feared Sejanus: at last he abandoned\r\nhimself, at once, to the rage of tyranny and the sway of his lusts: for,\r\nhe had then conquered all the checks of shame and fear, and thenceforth\r\nfollowed only the bent of his own abominable spirit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA TREATISE OF THE SITUATION, CUSTOMS, AND PEOPLE OF GERMANY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe whole of Germany is thus bounded; separated from Gaul, from Rhoetia\r\nand Pannonia, by the rivers Rhine and Danube; from Sarmatia and Dacia by\r\nmutual fear, or by high mountains: the rest is encompassed by the ocean,\r\nwhich forms huge bays, and comprehends a tract of islands immense in\r\nextent: for we have lately known certain nations and kingdoms there,\r\nsuch as the war discovered. The Rhine rising in the Rhoetian Alps from a\r\nsummit altogether rocky and perpendicular, after a small winding towards\r\nthe west, is lost in the Northern Ocean. The Danube issues out of the\r\nmountain Abnoba, one very high but very easy of ascent, and traversing\r\nseveral nations, falls by six streams into the Euxine Sea; for its\r\nseventh channel is absorbed in the Fenns.\r\n\r\nThe Germans, I am apt to believe, derive their original from no other\r\npeople; and are nowise mixed with different nations arriving amongst\r\nthem: since anciently those who went in search of new dwellings,\r\ntravelled not by land, but were carried in fleets; and into that mighty\r\nocean so boundless, and, as I may call it, so repugnant and forbidding,\r\nships from our world rarely enter. Moreover, besides the dangers from\r\na sea tempestuous, horrid and unknown, who would relinquish Asia, or\r\nAfrica, or Italy, to repair to Germany, a region hideous and rude,\r\nunder a rigorous climate, dismal to behold or to manure; [Footnote:\r\nTo cultivate.] unless the same were his native country? In their old\r\nballads (which amongst them are the only sort of registers and history)\r\nthey celebrate _Tuisto_, a God sprung from the earth, and _Mannus_ his\r\nson, as the fathers and founders of the nation. To _Mannus_ they assign\r\nthree sons, after whose names so many people are called; the Ingaevones,\r\ndwelling next the ocean; the Herminones, in the middle country; and all\r\nthe rest, Istaevones. Some, borrowing a warrant from the darkness of\r\nantiquity, maintain that the God had more sons, that thence came\r\nmore denominations of people, the Marsians, Cambrians, Suevians, and\r\nVandalians, and that these are the names truly genuine and original. For\r\nthe rest, they affirm Germany to be a recent word, lately bestowed: for\r\nthat those who first passed the Rhine and expulsed the Gauls, and are\r\nnow named Tungrians, were then called Germans: and thus by degrees\r\nthe name of a tribe prevailed, not that of the nation; so that by an\r\nappellation at first occasioned by terror and conquest, they afterwards\r\nchose to be distinguished, and assuming a name lately invented were\r\nuniversally called _Germans_.\r\n\r\nThey have a tradition that Hercules also had been in their country, and\r\nhim above all other heroes they extol in their songs when they advance\r\nto battle. Amongst them too are found that kind of verses by the recital\r\nof which (by them called _Barding_) they inspire bravery; nay, by such\r\nchanting itself they divine the success of the approaching fight. For,\r\naccording to the different din of the battle, they urge furiously, or\r\nshrink timorously. Nor does what they utter, so much seem to be singing\r\nas the voice and exertion of valour. They chiefly study a tone fierce\r\nand harsh, with a broken and unequal murmur, and therefore apply their\r\nshields to their mouths, whence the voice may by rebounding swell with\r\ngreater fulness and force. Besides there are some of opinion, that\r\nUlysses, whilst he wandered about in his long and fabulous voyages, was\r\ncarried into this ocean and entered Germany, and that by him Asciburgium\r\nwas founded and named, a city at this day standing and inhabited upon\r\nthe bank of the Rhine: nay, that in the same place was formerly found an\r\naltar dedicated to Ulysses, with the name of his father Laertes added\r\nto his own, and that upon the confines of Germany and Rhoetia are still\r\nextant certain monuments and tombs inscribed with Greek characters.\r\nTraditions these which I mean not either to confirm with arguments of\r\nmy own or to refute. Let every one believe or deny the same according to\r\nhis own bent.\r\n\r\nFor myself, I concur in opinion with such as suppose the people of\r\nGermany never to have mingled by inter-marriages with other nations, but\r\nto have remained a people pure, and independent, and resembling none but\r\nthemselves. Hence amongst such a mighty multitude of men, the same make\r\nand form is found in all, eyes stern and blue, yellow hair, huge bodies,\r\nbut vigorous only in the first onset. Of pains and labour they are not\r\nequally patient, nor can they at all endure thrift and heat. To bear\r\nhunger and cold they are hardened by their climate and soil.\r\n\r\nTheir lands, however somewhat different in aspect, yet taken all\r\ntogether consist of gloomy forests or nasty marshes; lower and moister\r\ntowards the confines of Gaul, more mountainous and windy towards Noricum\r\nand Pannonia; very apt to bear grain, but altogether unkindly to fruit\r\ntrees; abounding in flocks and herds, but generally small of growth.\r\nNor even in their oxen is found the usual stateliness, no more than the\r\nnatural ornaments and grandeur of head. In the number of their herds\r\nthey rejoice; and these are their only, these their most desirable\r\nriches. Silver and gold the Gods have denied them, whether in mercy or\r\nin wrath, I am unable to determine. Yet I would not venture to aver\r\nthat in Germany no vein of gold or silver is produced; for who has\r\never searched? For the use and possession, it is certain they care not.\r\nAmongst them indeed are to be seen vessels of silver, such as have\r\nbeen presented to their Princes and Ambassadors, but holden in no other\r\nesteem than vessels made of earth. The Germans however adjoining to our\r\nfrontiers value gold and silver for the purposes of commerce, and are\r\nwont to distinguish and prefer certain of our coins. They who live more\r\nremote are more primitive and simple in their dealings, and exchange\r\none commodity for another. The money which they like is the old and long\r\nknown, that indented, [Footnote: With milled edges.] or that impressed\r\nwith a chariot and two horses. Silver too is what they seek more than\r\ngold, from no fondness or preference, but because small pieces are more\r\nready in purchasing things cheap and common.\r\n\r\nNeither in truth do they abound in iron, as from the fashion of their\r\nweapons may be gathered. Swords they rarely use, or the larger spear.\r\nThey carry javelins or, in their own language, _framms_, pointed with a\r\npiece of iron short and narrow, but so sharp and manageable, that with\r\nthe same weapon they can fight at a distance or hand to hand, just as\r\nneed requires. Nay, the horsemen also are content with a shield and a\r\njavelin. The foot throw likewise weapons missive, each particular\r\nis armed with many, and hurls them a mighty space, all naked or only\r\nwearing a light cassock. In their equipment they show no ostentation;\r\nonly that their shields are diversified and adorned with curious\r\ncolours. With coats of mail very few are furnished, and hardly upon any\r\nis seen a headpiece or helmet. Their horses are nowise signal either in\r\nfashion or in fleetness; nor taught to wheel and bound, according to the\r\npractice of the Romans: they only move them forward in a line, or turn\r\nthem right about, with such compactness and equality that no one is ever\r\nbehind the rest. To one who considers the whole it is manifest, that\r\nin their foot their principal strength lies, and therefore they fight\r\nintermixed with the horse: for such is their swiftness as to match\r\nand suit with the motions and engagements of the cavalry. So that the\r\ninfantry are elected from amongst the most robust of their youth, and\r\nplaced in front of the army. The number to be sent is also ascertained,\r\nout of every village _an hundred_, and by this very name they continue\r\nto be called at home, _those of the hundred band_: thus what was at\r\nfirst no more than a number, becomes thenceforth a title and distinction\r\nof honour. In arraying their army, they divide the whole into distinct\r\nbattalions formed sharp in front. To recoil in battle, provided you\r\nreturn again to the attack, passes with them rather for policy than\r\nfear. Even when the combat is no more than doubtful, they bear away the\r\nbodies of their slain. The most glaring disgrace that can befall them,\r\nis to have quitted their shield; nor to one branded with such ignominy\r\nis it lawful to join in their sacrifices, or to enter into their\r\nassemblies; and many who had escaped in the day of battle, have hanged\r\nthemselves to put an end to this their infamy.\r\n\r\nIn the choice of kings they are determined by the splendour of their\r\nrace, in that of generals by their bravery. Neither is the power of\r\ntheir kings unbounded or arbitrary: and their generals procure obedience\r\nnot so much by the force of their authority as by that of their example,\r\nwhen they appear enterprising and brave, when they signalise themselves\r\nby courage and prowess; and if they surpass all in admiration and\r\npre-eminence, if they surpass all at the head of an army. But to none\r\nelse but the Priests is it allowed to exercise correction, or to inflict\r\nbonds or stripes. Nor when the Priests do this, is the same considered\r\nas a punishment, or arising from the orders of the general, but from the\r\nimmediate command of the Deity, Him whom they believe to accompany them\r\nin war. They therefore carry with them when going to fight, certain\r\nimages and figures taken out of their holy groves. What proves the\r\nprincipal incentive to their valour is, that it is not at random nor by\r\nthe fortuitous conflux of men that their troops and pointed battalions\r\nare formed, but by the conjunction of whole families, and tribes of\r\nrelations. Moreover, close to the field of battle are lodged all the\r\nnearest and most interesting pledges of nature. Hence they hear the\r\ndoleful howlings of their wives, hence the cries of their tender\r\ninfants. These are to each particular the witnesses whom he most\r\nreverences and dreads; these yield him the praise which affect him most.\r\nTheir wounds and maims they carry to their mothers, or to their wives,\r\nneither are their mothers or wives shocked in telling, or in sucking\r\ntheir bleeding sores. [Footnote: Nec illae numerare aut exigere plagas\r\npavent.] Nay, to their husbands and sons whilst engaged in battle, they\r\nadminister meat and encouragement.\r\n\r\nIn history we find, that some armies already yielding and ready to fly,\r\nhave been by the women restored, through their inflexible importunity\r\nand entreaties, presenting their breasts, and showing their impending\r\ncaptivity; an evil to the Germans then by far most dreadful when it\r\nbefalls their women. So that the spirit of such cities as amongst\r\ntheir hostages are enjoined to send their damsels of quality, is always\r\nengaged more effectually than that of others. They even believe them\r\nendowed with something celestial and the spirit of prophecy. Neither\r\ndo they disdain to consult them, nor neglect the responses which they\r\nreturn. In the reign of the deified Vespasian, we have seen _Veleda_ for\r\na long time, and by many nations, esteemed and adored as a divinity. In\r\ntimes past they likewise worshipped _Aurinia_ and several more, from\r\nno complaisance or effort of flattery, nor as Deities of their own\r\ncreating.\r\n\r\nOf all the Gods, Mercury is he whom they worship most. To him on certain\r\nstated days it is lawful to offer even human victims. Hercules and Mars\r\nthey appease with beasts usually allowed for sacrifice. Some of the\r\nSuevians make likewise immolations to _Isis_, Concerning the cause and\r\noriginal of this foreign sacrifice I have found small light; unless\r\nthe figure of her image formed like a galley, show that such devotion\r\narrived from abroad. For the rest, from the grandeur and majesty of\r\nbeings celestial, they judge it altogether unsuitable to hold the Gods\r\nenclosed within walls, or to represent them under any human likeness.\r\nThey consecrate whole woods and groves, and by the names of the Gods\r\nthey call these recesses; divinities these, which only in contemplation\r\nand mental reverence they behold.\r\n\r\nTo the use of lots and auguries, they are addicted beyond all other\r\nnations. Their method of divining by lots is exceeding simple. From a\r\ntree which bears fruit they cut a twig, and divide it into two small\r\npieces. These they distinguish by so many several marks, and throw them\r\nat random and without order upon a white garment. Then the Priest of the\r\ncommunity, if for the public the lots are consulted, or the father of\r\na family if about a private concern, after he has solemnly invoked the\r\nGods, with eyes lifted up to heaven, takes up every piece thrice, and\r\nhaving done thus forms a judgment according to the marks before made. If\r\nthe chances have proved forbidding, they are no more consulted upon the\r\nsame affair during the same day: even when they are inviting, yet, for\r\nconfirmation, the faith of auguries too is tried. Yea, here also is the\r\nknown practice of divining events from the voices and flight of birds.\r\nBut to this nation it is peculiar, to learn presages and admonitions\r\ndivine from horses also. These are nourished by the State in the same\r\nsacred woods and groves, all milk-white and employed in no earthly\r\nlabour. These yoked in the holy chariot, are accompanied by the Priest\r\nand the King, or the Chief of the community, who both carefully observe\r\nhis actions and neighing. Nor in any sort of augury is more faith and\r\nassurance reposed, not by the populace only, but even by the nobles,\r\neven by the Priests. These account themselves the ministers of the Gods,\r\nand the horses privy to his will. They have likewise another method of\r\ndivination, whence to learn the issue of great and mighty wars. From the\r\nnation with whom they are at war they contrive, it avails not how, to\r\ngain a captive: him they engage in combat with one selected from amongst\r\nthemselves, each armed after the manner of his country, and according\r\nas the victory falls to this or to the other, gather a presage of the\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\nAffairs of smaller moment the chiefs determine: about matters of\r\nhigher consequence the whole nation deliberates; yet in such sort,\r\nthat whatever depends upon the pleasure and decision of the people, is\r\nexamined and discussed by the chiefs. Where no accident or emergency\r\nintervenes, they assemble upon stated days, either when the moon\r\nchanges, or is full: since they believe such seasons to be the most\r\nfortunate for beginning all transactions. Neither in reckoning of time\r\ndo they count, like us, the number of days but that of nights. In this\r\nstyle their ordinances are framed, in this style their diets appointed;\r\nand with them the night seems to lead and govern the day. From their\r\nextensive liberty this evil and default flows, that they meet not at\r\nonce, nor as men commanded and afraid to disobey; so that often the\r\nsecond day, nay often the third, is consumed through the slowness of the\r\nmembers in assembling. They sit down as they list, promiscuously, like a\r\ncrowd, and all armed. It is by the Priests that silence is enjoined,\r\nand with the power of correction the Priests are then invested. Then the\r\nKing or Chief is heard, as are others, each according to his precedence\r\nin age, or in nobility, or in warlike renown, or in eloquence; and the\r\ninfluence of every speaker proceeds rather from his ability to persuade\r\nthan from any authority to command. If the proposition displease, they\r\nreject it by an inarticulate murmur: if it be pleasing, they brandish\r\ntheir javelins. The most honourable manner of signifying their assent,\r\nis to express their applause by the sound of their arms.\r\n\r\nIn the assembly it is allowed to present accusations, and to prosecute\r\ncapital offences. Punishments vary according to the quality of the\r\ncrime. Traitors and deserters they hang upon trees. Cowards, and\r\nsluggards, and unnatural prostitutes they smother in mud and bogs under\r\nan heap of hurdles. Such diversity in their executions has this view,\r\nthat in punishing of glaring iniquities, it behoves likewise to\r\ndisplay them to sight: but effeminacy and pollution must be buried and\r\nconcealed. In lighter transgressions too the penalty is measured by\r\nthe fault, and the delinquents upon conviction are condemned to pay a\r\ncertain number of horses or cattle. Part of this mulct accrues to the\r\nKing or to the community, part to him whose wrongs are vindicated, or to\r\nhis next kindred. In the same assemblies are also chosen their chiefs\r\nor rulers, such as administer justice in their villages and boroughs.\r\nTo each of these are assigned an hundred persons chosen from amongst\r\nthe populace, to accompany and assist him, men who help him at once with\r\ntheir authority and their counsel.\r\n\r\nWithout being armed they transact nothing, whether of public or private\r\nconcernment. But it is repugnant to their custom for any man to use\r\narms, before the community has attested his capacity to wield them.\r\nUpon such testimonial, either one of the rulers, or his father, or\r\nsome kinsman dignify the young man in the midst of the assembly, with\r\na shield and javelin. This amongst them is the _manly robe_, this the\r\nfirst degree of honour conferred upon their youth. Before this they seem\r\nno more than part of a private family, but thenceforward part of the\r\nCommonweal. The princely dignity they confer even upon striplings, whose\r\nrace is eminently noble, or whose fathers have done great and signal\r\nservices to the State. For about the rest, who are more vigorous and\r\nlong since tried, they crowd to attend: nor is it any shame to be seen\r\namongst the followers of these. Nay, there are likewise degrees of\r\nfollowers, higher or lower, just as he whom they follow judges fit.\r\nMighty too is the emulation amongst these followers, of each to be first\r\nin favour with his Prince; mighty also the emulation of the Princes,\r\nto excel in the number and valour of followers. This is their principal\r\nstate, this their chief force, to be at all times surrounded with a huge\r\nband of chosen young men, for ornament and glory in peace, for security\r\nand defence in war. Nor is it amongst his own people only, but even from\r\nthe neighbouring communities, that any of their Princes reaps so\r\nmuch renown and a name so great, when he surpasses in the number and\r\nmagnanimity of his followers. For such are courted by Embassies, and\r\ndistinguished with presents, and by the terror of their fame alone often\r\ndissipate wars.\r\n\r\nIn the day of battle, it is scandalous to the Prince to be surpassed in\r\nfeats of bravery, scandalous to his followers to fail in matching the\r\nbravery of the Prince. But it is infamy during life, and indelible\r\nreproach, to return alive from a battle where their Prince was slain.\r\nTo preserve their Prince, to defend him, and to ascribe to his glory all\r\ntheir own valorous deeds, is the sum and most sacred part of their oath.\r\nThe Princes fight for victory; for the Prince his followers fight. Many\r\nof the young nobility, when their own community comes to languish in\r\nits vigour by long peace and inactivity, betake themselves through\r\nimpatience to other States which then prove to be in war. For,\r\nbesides that this people cannot brook repose, besides that by perilous\r\nadventures they more quickly blazon their fame, they cannot otherwise\r\nthan by violence and war support their huge train of retainers. For from\r\nthe liberality of their Prince, they demand and enjoy that _war-horse_\r\nof theirs, with that _victorious javelin_ dyed in the blood of their\r\nenemies. In the place of pay, they are supplied with a daily table and\r\nrepasts; though grossly prepared, yet very profuse. For maintaining such\r\nliberality and munificence, a fund is furnished by continual wars and\r\nplunder. Nor could you so easily persuade them to cultivate the ground,\r\nor to await the return of the seasons and produce of the year, as\r\nto provoke the foe and to risk wounds and death: since stupid and\r\nspiritless they account it, to acquire by their sweat what they can gain\r\nby their blood.\r\n\r\nUpon any recess from war, they do not much attend the chase. Much more\r\nof their time they pass in indolence, resigned to sleep and repasts.\r\n[Footnote: \"Dediti somno, ciboque:\" handed over to sloth and gluttony.]\r\nAll the most brave, all the most warlike, apply to nothing at all;\r\nbut to their wives, to the ancient men, and to every the most impotent\r\ndomestic, trust all the care of their house, and of their lands and\r\npossessions. They themselves loiter. [Footnote: Are rude and lazy.] Such\r\nis the amazing diversity of their nature, that in the same men is\r\nfound so much delight in sloth, with so much enmity to tranquillity and\r\nrepose. The communities are wont, of their own accord and man by man,\r\nto bestow upon their Princes a certain number of beasts, or a certain\r\nportion of grain; a contribution which passes indeed for a mark of\r\nreverence and honour, but serves also to supply their necessities. They\r\nchiefly rejoice in the gifts which come from the bordering countries,\r\nsuch as are sent not only by particulars but in the name of the State;\r\ncurious horses, splendid armour, rich harness, with collars of silver\r\nand gold. Now too they have learnt, what we have taught them, to receive\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nThat none of the several people in Germany live together in cities, is\r\nabundantly known; nay, that amongst them none of their dwellings are\r\nsuffered to be contiguous. They inhabit apart and distinct, just as a\r\nfountain, or a field, or a wood happened to invite them to settle. They\r\nraise their villages in opposite rows, but not in our manner with the\r\nhouses joined one to another. Every man has a vacant space quite round\r\nhis own, whether for security against accidents from fire, or that they\r\nwant the art of building. With them in truth, is unknown even the use of\r\nmortar and of tiles. In all their structures they employ materials\r\nquite gross and unhewn, void of fashion and comeliness. Some parts\r\nthey besmear with an earth so pure and resplendent, that it resembles\r\npainting and colours. They are likewise wont to scoop caves deep in the\r\nground, and over them to lay great heaps of dung. Thither they retire\r\nfor shelter in the winter, and thither convey their grain: for by such\r\nclose places they mollify the rigorous and excessive cold. Besides\r\nwhen at any time their enemy invades them, he can only ravage the\r\nopen country, but either knows not such recesses as are invisible and\r\nsubterraneous; or must suffer them to escape him, on this very account\r\nthat he is uncertain where to find them.\r\n\r\nFor their covering a mantle is what they all wear, fastened with a clasp\r\nor, for want of it, with a thorn. As far as this reaches not they\r\nare naked, and lie whole days before the fire. The most wealthy are\r\ndistinguished with a vest, not one large and flowing like those of\r\nSarmatians and Parthians, but girt close about them and expressing the\r\nproportion of every limb. They likewise wear the skins of savage beasts,\r\na dress which those bordering upon the Rhine use without any fondness or\r\ndelicacy, but about which such who live further in the country are more\r\ncurious, as void of all apparel introduced by commerce. They choose\r\ncertain wild beasts, and, having flayed them, diversify their hides with\r\nmany spots, as also with the skins of monsters from the deep, such as\r\nare engendered in the distant ocean and in seas unknown. Neither does\r\nthe dress of the women differ from that of the men, save that the\r\nwomen are orderly attired in linen embroidered with purple, and use no\r\nsleeves, so that all their arms are bare. The upper part of their breast\r\nis withal exposed. Yet the laws of matrimony are severely observed\r\nthere; nor in the whole of their manners is ought more praiseworthy than\r\nthis: for they are almost the only Barbarians contented with one wife,\r\nexcepting a very few amongst them; men of dignity who marry divers\r\nwives, from no wantonness or lubricity, but courted for the lustre of\r\ntheir family into many alliances.\r\n\r\nTo the husband, the wife tenders no dowry; but the husband, to the wife.\r\nThe parents and relations attend and declare their approbation of the\r\npresents, not presents adapted to feminine pomp and delicacy, nor such\r\nas serve to deck the new married woman; but oxen and horse accoutred,\r\nand a shield, with a javelin and sword. By virtue of these gifts, she\r\nis espoused. She too on her part brings her husband some arms. This they\r\nesteem the highest tie, these the holy mysteries, and matrimonial Gods.\r\nThat the woman may not suppose herself free from the considerations of\r\nfortitude and fighting, or exempt from the casualties of war, the very\r\nfirst solemnities of her wedding serve to warn her, that she comes to\r\nher husband as a partner in his hazards and fatigues, that she is to\r\nsuffer alike with him, to adventure alike, during peace or during war.\r\nThis the oxen joined in the same yoke plainly indicate, this the horse\r\nready equipped, this the present of arms. 'Tis thus she must be content\r\nto live, thus to resign life. The arms which she then receives she must\r\npreserve inviolate, and to her sons restore the same, as presents worthy\r\nof them, such as their wives may again receive, and still resign to her\r\ngrandchildren.\r\n\r\nThey therefore live in a state of chastity well secured; corrupted by no\r\nseducing shows and public diversions, by no irritations from banqueting.\r\nOf learning and of any secret intercourse by letters, they are all\r\nequally ignorant, men and women. Amongst a people so numerous, adultery\r\nis exceeding rare; a crime instantly punished, and the punishment left\r\nto be inflicted by the husband. He, having cut off her hair, expells her\r\nfrom his house naked, in presence of her kindred, and pursues her with\r\nstripes throughout the village. For, to a woman who has prostituted her\r\nperson, no pardon is ever granted. However beautiful she be, however\r\nyoung, however abounding in wealth, a husband she can never find. In\r\ntruth, nobody turns vices into mirth there, nor is the practice of\r\ncorrupting and of yielding to corruption, called the custom of the Age.\r\nBetter still do those communities, in which none but virgins marry, and\r\nwhere to a single marriage all their views and inclinations are at once\r\nconfined. Thus, as they have but one body and one life, they take\r\nbut one husband, that beyond him they may have no thought, no further\r\nwishes, nor love him only as their husband but as their marriage.\r\n[Footnote: \"Sed tamquam matrimonium ament.\"] To restrain generation and\r\nthe increase of children, is esteemed an abominable sin, as also to kill\r\ninfants newly born. And more powerful with them are good manners, than\r\nwith other people are good laws.\r\n\r\nIn all their houses the children are reared naked and nasty; and thus\r\ngrow into those limbs, into that bulk, which with marvel we behold.\r\nThey are all nourished with the milk of their own mothers, and never\r\nsurrendered to handmaids and nurses. The lord you cannot discern from\r\nthe slave, by any superior delicacy in rearing. Amongst the same cattle\r\nthey promiscuously live, upon the same ground they without distinction\r\nlie, till at a proper age the free-born are parted from the rest, and\r\ntheir bravery recommend them to notice. Slow and late do the young men\r\ncome to the use of women, and thus very long preserve the vigour of\r\nyouth. Neither are the virgins hastened to wed. They must both have\r\nthe same sprightly youth, the like stature, and marry when equal and\r\nable-bodied. Thus the robustness of the parents is inherited by the\r\nchildren. Children are holden in the same estimation with their mother's\r\nbrother, as with their father. Some hold this tie of blood to be most\r\ninviolable and binding, and in receiving of hostages, such pledges are\r\nmost considered and claimed, as they who at once possess affections\r\nthe most unalienable, and the most diffuse interest in their family.\r\nTo every man, however, his own children are heirs and successors: wills\r\nthey make none: for want of children his next akin inherits; his own\r\nbrothers, those of his father, or those of his mother. To ancient men,\r\nthe more they abound in descendants, in relations and affinities, so\r\nmuch the more favour and reverence accrues. From being childless, no\r\nadvantage nor estimation is derived.\r\n\r\nAll the enmities of your house, whether of your father or of your\r\nkindred, you must necessarily adopt; as well as all their friendships.\r\nNeither are such enmities unappeasable and permanent: since even for\r\nso great a crime as homicide, compensation is made by a fixed number of\r\nsheep and cattle, and by it the whole family is pacified to content.\r\nA temper this, wholesome to the State; because to a free nation,\r\nanimosities and faction are always more menacing and perilous. In social\r\nfeasts, and deeds of hospitality, no nation upon earth was ever more\r\nliberal and abounding. To refuse admitting under your roof any man\r\nwhatsoever, is held wicked and inhuman. Every man receives every\r\ncomer, and treats him with repasts as large as his ability can possibly\r\nfurnish. When the whole stock is consumed, he who had treated\r\nso hospitably guides and accompanies his guest to a new scene of\r\nhospitality; and both proceed to the next house, though neither of them\r\ninvited. Nor avails it, that they were not: they are there received,\r\nwith the same frankness and humanity. Between a stranger and an\r\nacquaintance, in dispensing the rules and benefits of hospitality, no\r\ndifference is made. Upon your departure, if you ask anything, it is\r\nthe custom to grant it; and with the same facility, they ask of you. In\r\ngifts they delight, but neither claim merit from what they give, nor own\r\nany obligation for what they receive. Their manner of entertaining their\r\nguests is familiar and kind.\r\n\r\nThe moment they rise from sleep, which they generally prolong till late\r\nin the day, they bathe, most frequently in warm water; as in a country\r\nwhere the winter is very long and severe. From bathing, they sit down to\r\nmeat; every man apart, upon a particular seat, and at a separate table.\r\nThey then proceed to their affairs, all in arms; as in arms, they\r\nno less frequently go to banquet. To continue drinking night and day\r\nwithout intermission, is a reproach to no man. Frequent then are their\r\nbroils, as usual amongst men intoxicated with liquor; and such broils\r\nrarely terminate in angry words, but for the most part in maimings and\r\nslaughter. Moreover in these their feasts, they generally deliberate\r\nabout reconciling parties at enmity, about forming affinities, choosing\r\nof Princes, and finally about peace and war. For they judge, that at no\r\nseason is the soul more open to thoughts that are artless and upright,\r\nor more fired with such as are great and bold. This people, of\r\nthemselves nowise subtile or politic, from the freedom of the place\r\nand occasion acquire still more frankness to disclose the most secret\r\nmotions and purposes of their hearts. When therefore the minds of all\r\nhave been once laid open and declared, on the day following the several\r\nsentiments are revised and canvassed; and to both conjectures of time,\r\ndue regard is had. They consult, when they know not how to dissemble;\r\nthey determine, when they cannot mistake.\r\n\r\nFor their drink, they draw a liquor from barley or other grain; and\r\nferment the same, so as to make it resemble wine. Nay, they who dwell\r\nupon the bank of the Rhine deal in wine. Their food is very simple; wild\r\nfruit, fresh venison, or coagulated milk. They banish hunger without\r\nformality, without curious dressing and curious fare. In extinguishing\r\nthirst, they use not equal temperance. If you will but humour their\r\nexcess in drinking, and supply them with as much as they covet, it will\r\nbe no less easy to vanquish them by vices than by arms.\r\n\r\nOf public diversions they have but one sort, and in all their meetings\r\nthe same is still exhibited. Young men, such, as make it their pastime,\r\nfling themselves naked and dance amongst sharp swords and the deadly\r\npoints of javelins. From habit they acquire their skill, and from their\r\nskill a graceful manner; yet from hence draw no gain or hire: though\r\nthis adventurous gaiety has its reward, namely, that of pleasing the\r\nspectators. What is marvellous, playing at dice is one of their most\r\nserious employments; and even sober, they are gamesters: nay, so\r\ndesperately do they venture upon the chance of winning or losing, that\r\nwhen their whole substance is played away, they stake their liberty and\r\ntheir persons upon one and the last throw. The loser goes calmly into\r\nvoluntary bondage. However younger he be, however stronger, he tamely\r\nsuffers himself to be bound and sold by the winner. Such is their\r\nperseverance in an evil course: they themselves call it honour.\r\n\r\nSlaves of this class, they exchange away in commerce, to free themselves\r\ntoo from the shame of such a victory. Of their other slaves they make\r\nnot such use as we do of ours, by distributing amongst them the several\r\noffices and employments of the family. Each of them has a dwelling of\r\nhis own, each a household to govern. His lord uses him like a tenant,\r\nand obliges him to pay a quantity of grain, or of cattle, or of cloth.\r\nThus far only the subserviency of the slave extends. All the other\r\nduties in a family, not the slaves, but the wives and children\r\ndischarge. To inflict stripes upon a slave, or to put him in chains, or\r\nto doom him to severe labour, are things rarely seen. To kill them they\r\nsometimes are wont, not through correction or government, but in heat\r\nand rage, as they would an enemy, save that no vengeance or penalty\r\nfollows. The freedmen very little surpass the slaves, rarely are of\r\nmoment in the house; in the community never, excepting only such nations\r\nwhere arbitrary dominion prevails. For there they bear higher sway\r\nthan the free-born, nay, higher than the nobles. In other countries the\r\ninferior condition of freedmen is a proof of public liberty.\r\n\r\nTo the practice of usury and of increasing money by interest, they are\r\nstrangers; and hence is found a better guard against it, than if it\r\nwere forbidden. They shift from land to land; and, still appropriating\r\na portion suitable to the number of hands for manuring, anon parcel out\r\nthe whole amongst particulars according to the condition and quality\r\nof each. As the plains are very spacious, the allotments are easily\r\nassigned. Every year they change, and cultivate a fresh soil; yet\r\nstill there is ground to spare. For they strive not to bestow labour\r\nproportionable to the fertility and compass of their lands, by planting\r\norchards, by enclosing meadows, by watering gardens. From the earth,\r\ncorn only is exacted. Hence they quarter not the year into so many\r\nseasons. Winter, Spring, and Summer, they understand; and for each\r\nhave proper appellations. Of the name and blessings of Autumn, they are\r\nequally ignorant.\r\n\r\nIn performing their funerals, they show no state or vainglory. This only\r\nis carefully observed, that with the corpses of their signal men certain\r\nwoods be burned. Upon the funeral pile they accumulate neither apparel\r\nnor perfumes. Into the fire, are always thrown the arms of the dead, and\r\nsometimes his horse. With sods of earth only the sepulchre is raised.\r\nThe pomp of tedious and elaborate monuments they contemn, as things\r\ngrievous to the deceased. Tears and wailings they soon dismiss: their\r\naffliction and woe they long retain. In women, it is reckoned becoming\r\nto bewail their loss; in men, to remember it. This is what in general\r\nwe have learned, in the original and customs of the whole people of\r\nGermany. I shall now deduce the institutions and usages of the several\r\npeople, as far as they vary one from another; as also an account of what\r\nnations from thence removed, to settle themselves in Gaul.\r\n\r\nThat the Gauls were in times past more puissant and formidable, is\r\nrelated by the Prince of authors, the deified Julius; [Footnote:\r\nJulius Caesar.] and hence it is probable that they too have passed into\r\nGermany. For what a small obstacle must be a river, to restrain any\r\nnation, as each grew more potent, from seizing or changing habitations;\r\nwhen as yet all habitations were common, and not parted or appropriated\r\nby the founding and terror of Monarchies? The region therefore between\r\nthe Hercynian Forest and the rivers Moenus [Footnote: Main.] and Rhine,\r\nwas occupied by the Helvetians; as was that beyond it by the Boians,\r\nboth nations of Gaul. There still remains a place called _Boiemum_,\r\nwhich denotes the primitive name and antiquity of the country, although\r\nthe inhabitants have been changed. But whether the Araviscans are\r\nderived from the Osians, a nation of Germans passing into Pannonia, or\r\nthe Osians from the Araviscans removing from thence into Germany, is\r\na matter undecided; since they both still use the language, the same\r\ncustoms and the same laws. For, as of old they lived alike poor and\r\nalike free, equal proved the evils and advantages on each side the\r\nriver, and common to both people. The Treverians and Nervians aspire\r\npassionately to the reputation of being descended from the Germans;\r\nsince by the glory of this original, they would escape all imputation\r\nof resembling the Gauls in person and effeminacy. Such as dwell upon the\r\nbank of the Rhine, the Vangiones, the Tribocians, and the Nemetes, are\r\nwithout doubt all Germans. The Ubians are ashamed of their original;\r\nthough they have a particular honour to boast, that of having merited\r\nan establishment as a Roman Colony, and still delight to be called\r\n_Agrippinensians_, after the name of their founder: they indeed formerly\r\ncame from beyond the Rhine, and, for the many proofs of their fidelity,\r\nwere settled upon the very bank of the river; not to be there confined\r\nor guarded themselves, but to guard and defend that boundary against the\r\nrest of the Germans.\r\n\r\nOf all these nations, the Batavians are the most signal in bravery. They\r\ninhabit not much territory upon the Rhine, but possess an island in it.\r\nThey were formerly part of the Cattans, and by means of feuds at home\r\nremoved to these dwellings; whence they might become a portion of the\r\nRoman Empire. With them this honour still remains, as also the memorials\r\nof their ancient association with us: for they are not under the\r\ncontempt of paying tribute, nor subject to be squeezed by the farmers of\r\nthe revenue. Free from all impositions and payments, and only set apart\r\nfor the purposes of fighting, they are reserved wholly for the wars,\r\nin the same manner as a magazine of weapons and armour. Under the same\r\ndegree of homage are the nation of the Mattiacians. For such is the\r\nmight and greatness of the Roman People, as to have carried the awe and\r\nesteem of their Empire beyond the Rhine and the ancient boundaries. Thus\r\nthe Mattiacians, living upon the opposite banks, enjoy a settlement and\r\nlimits of their own; yet in spirit and inclination are attached to\r\nus: in other things resembling the Batavians, save that as they still\r\nbreathe their original air, still possess their primitive soil, they are\r\nthence inspired with superior vigour and keenness. Amongst the people\r\nof Germany I would not reckon those who occupy the lands which are\r\nunder decimation, though they be such as dwell beyond the Rhine and the\r\nDanube. By several worthless and vagabond Gauls, and such as poverty\r\nrendered daring, that region was seized as one belonging to no certain\r\npossessor: afterwards it became a skirt of the Empire and part of a\r\nprovince, upon the enlargement of our bounds and the extending of our\r\ngarrisons and frontier.\r\n\r\nBeyond these are the Cattans, whose territories begin at the Hercynian\r\nForest, and consist not of such wide and marshy plains, as those of\r\nthe other communities contained within the vast compass of Germany; but\r\nproduce ranges of hills, such as run lofty and contiguous for a long\r\ntract, then by degrees sink and decay. Moreover the Hercynian Forest\r\nattends for a while its native Cattans, then suddenly forsakes them.\r\nThis people are distinguished with bodies more hardy and robust, compact\r\nlimbs, stern countenances, and greater vigour of spirit. For Germans,\r\nthey are men of much sense and address. [Footnote: \"Leur intelligence\r\net leur finesse étonnent, dans des Germains.\"] They dignify chosen men,\r\nlisten to such as are set over them, know how to preserve their post,\r\nto discern occasions, to rebate their own ardour and impatience; how\r\nto employ the day, how to entrench themselves by night. They account\r\nfortune amongst things slippery and uncertain, but bravery amongst such\r\nas are never-failing and secure; and, what is exceeding rare nor ever to\r\nbe learnt but by a wholesome course of discipline, in the conduct of\r\nthe general they repose more assurance than in the strength of the\r\narmy. Their whole forces consist of foot, who besides their arms carry\r\nlikewise instruments of iron and their provisions. You may see other\r\nGermans proceed equipped to battle, but the Cattans so as to conduct a\r\nwar. [Footnote: \"Alios ad proelium ire videas, Chattos ad bellum.\"]\r\nThey rarely venture upon excursions or casual encounters. It is in truth\r\npeculiar to cavalry, suddenly to conquer, or suddenly to fly. Such haste\r\nand velocity rather resembles fear. Patience and deliberation are more\r\nakin to intrepidity.\r\n\r\nMoreover a custom, practised indeed in other nations of Germany, yet\r\nvery rarely and confined only to particulars more daring than the rest,\r\nprevails amongst the Cattans by universal consent. As soon as they\r\narrive to maturity of years, they let their hair and beards continue to\r\ngrow, nor till they have slain an enemy do they ever lay aside this form\r\nof countenance by vow sacred to valour. Over the blood and spoil of a\r\nfoe they make bare their face. They allege, that they have now acquitted\r\nthemselves of the debt and duty contracted by their birth, and rendered\r\nthemselves worthy of their country, worthy of their parents. Upon the\r\nspiritless, cowardly and unwarlike, such deformity of visage still\r\nremains. [Footnote: \"Manet squalor.\"] All the most brave likewise wear\r\nan iron ring (a mark of great dishonour this in that nation) and retain\r\nit as a chain; till by killing an enemy they become released. Many of\r\nthe Cattans delight always to bear this terrible aspect; and, when grown\r\nwhite through age, become awful and conspicuous by such marks, both to\r\nthe enemy and their own countrymen. By them in all engagements the first\r\nassault is made: of them the front of the battle is always composed,\r\nas men who in their looks are singular and tremendous. For even\r\nduring peace they abate nothing in the grimness and horror of their\r\ncountenance. They have no house to inhabit, no land to cultivate, nor\r\nany domestic charge or care. With whomsoever they come to sojourn,\r\nby him they are maintained; always very prodigal of the substance of\r\nothers, always despising what is their own, till the feebleness of old\r\nage overtakes them, and renders them unequal to the efforts of such\r\nrigid bravery.\r\n\r\nNext to the Cattans, dwell the Usipians and Tencterians; upon the Rhine\r\nnow running in a channel uniform and certain, such as suffices for a\r\nboundary. The Tencterians, besides their wonted glory in war, surpass in\r\nthe service and discipline of their cavalry. Nor do the Cattans derive\r\nhigher applause from their foot, than the Tencterians from their horse.\r\nSuch was the order established by their forefathers, and what their\r\nposterity still pursue. From riding and exercising of horses, their\r\nchildren borrow their pastimes; in this exercise the young men find\r\nmatter for emulating one another, and in this the old men take pleasure\r\nto persevere. Horses are by the father bequeathed as part of his\r\nhousehold and family, horses are conveyed amongst the rights of\r\nsuccession, and as such the son receives them; but not the eldest son,\r\nlike other effects, by priority of birth, but he who happens to be\r\nsignal in boldness and superior in war.\r\n\r\nContiguous to the Tencterians formerly dwelt the Bructerians, in whose\r\nroom it is said the Chamavians and Angrivarians are now settled; they\r\nwho expulsed and almost extirpated the Bructerians, with the concurrence\r\nof the neighbouring nations: whether in detestation of their arrogance,\r\nor allured by the love of spoil, or through the special favour of the\r\nGods towards us Romans. They in truth even vouchsafed to gratify us with\r\nthe sight of the battle. In it there fell above sixty thousand souls,\r\nwithout a blow struck by the Romans; but, what is a circumstance\r\nstill more glorious, fell to furnish them with a spectacle of joy and\r\nrecreation. May the Gods continue and perpetuate amongst these nations,\r\nif not any love for us, yet by all means this their animosity and hate\r\ntowards each other: since whilst the destiny of the Empire thus urges\r\nit, fortune cannot more signally befriend us, than in sowing strife\r\namongst our foes.\r\n\r\nThe Angrivarians and Chamavians are enclosed behind, by the Dulgibinians\r\nand Chasuarians; and by other nations not so much noted: before, the\r\nFrisians face them. The country of Frisia is divided into two; called\r\nthe greater and lesser, according to the measure of their strength. Both\r\nnations stretch along the Rhine, quite to the ocean; and surround\r\nvast lakes such as once have borne Roman fleets. We have moreover even\r\nventured out from thence into the ocean, and upon its coasts common fame\r\nhas reported the pillars of Hercules to be still standing: whether it be\r\nthat Hercules ever visited these parts, or that to his renowned name we\r\nare wont to ascribe whatever is grand and glorious everywhere. Neither\r\ndid Drusus who made the attempt, want boldness to pursue it: but the\r\nroughness of the ocean withstood him, nor would suffer discoveries to\r\nbe made about itself, no more than about Hercules. Thenceforward the\r\nenterprise was dropped: nay, more pious and reverential it seemed, to\r\nbelieve the marvellous feats of the Gods than to know and to prove them.\r\n[Footnote: \"Coelum ipsum petimus stultitia.\"]\r\n\r\nHitherto, I have been describing Germany towards the west. To the\r\nnorthward, it winds away with an immense compass. And first of all\r\noccurs the nation of the Chaucians: who though they begin immediately\r\nat the confines of the Frisians, and occupy part of the shore, extend\r\nso far as to border upon all the several people whom I have already\r\nrecounted; till at last, by a circuit, they reach quite to the\r\nboundaries of the Cattans. A region so vast, the Chaucians do not only\r\npossess but fill; a people of all the Germans the most noble, such as\r\nwould rather maintain their grandeur by justice than violence. They live\r\nin repose, retired from broils abroad, void of avidity to possess more,\r\nfree from a spirit of domineering over others. They provoke no wars,\r\nthey ravage no countries, they pursue no plunder. Of their bravery and\r\npower, the chief evidence arises from hence, that, without wronging or\r\noppressing others, they are come to be superior to all. Yet they are all\r\nready to arm, and if an exigency require, armies are presently raised,\r\npowerful and abounding as they are in men and horses; and even when they\r\nare quiet and their weapons laid aside, their credit and name continue\r\nequally high.\r\n\r\nAlong the side of the Chaucians and Cattans dwell the Cheruscans; a\r\npeople who finding no enemy to rouse them, were enfeebled by a peace\r\noverlasting and uniform, but such as they failed not to nourish. A\r\nconduct which proved more pleasing than secure; since treacherous is\r\nthat repose which you enjoy amongst neighbours that are very powerful\r\nand very fond of rule and mastership. When recourse is once had to the\r\nsword, modesty and fair dealing will be vainly pleaded by the weaker;\r\nnames these which are always assumed by the stronger. Thus the\r\nCheruscans, they who formerly bore the character of _good and upright_,\r\nare now called _cowards and fools_; and the fortune of the Cattans\r\nwho subdued them, grew immediately to be wisdom. In the ruin of the\r\nCheruscans, the Fosians, also their neighbours, were involved; and in\r\ntheir calamities bore an equal share, though in their prosperity they\r\nhad been weaker and less considered.\r\n\r\nIn the same winding tract of Germany live the Cimbrians, close to the\r\nocean; a community now very small, but great in fame. Nay, of their\r\nancient renown, many and extensive are the traces and monuments still\r\nremaining; even their entrenchments upon either shore, so vast in\r\ncompass that from thence you may even now measure the greatness and\r\nnumerous bands of that people, and assent to the account of an army so\r\nmighty. It was on the six hundred and fortieth year of Rome, when of the\r\narms of the Cimbrians the first mention was made, during the Consulship\r\nof Caecilius Metellus and Papirius Carbo. If from that time we count to\r\nthe second Consulship of the Emperor Trajan, the interval comprehends\r\nnear two hundred and ten years; so long have we been conquering Germany.\r\nIn a course of time, so vast between these two periods, many have been\r\nthe blows and disasters suffered on each side. In truth neither from the\r\nSamnites, nor from the Carthaginians, nor from both Spains, nor from all\r\nthe nations of Gaul, have we received more frequent checks and alarms;\r\nnor even from the Parthians: for, more vigorous and invincible is the\r\nliberty of the Germans than the monarchy of the Arsacides. Indeed, what\r\nhas the power of the East to allege to our dishonour; but the fall of\r\nCrassus, that power which was itself overthrown and abased by Ventidius,\r\nwith the loss of the great King Pacorus bereft of his life? But by the\r\nGermans the Roman People have been bereft of five armies, all commanded\r\nby Consuls; by the Germans, the commanders of these armies, Carbo, and\r\nCassius, and Scaurus Aurelius, and Servilius Caepio, as also Marcus\r\nManlius, were all routed or taken: by the Germans even the Emperor\r\nAugustus was bereft of Varus and three legions. Nor without difficulty\r\nand loss of men were they defeated by Caius Marius in Italy, or by the\r\ndeified Julius in Gaul, or by Drusus or Tiberius or Germanicus in their\r\nnative territories. Soon after, the mighty menaces of Caligula against\r\nthem ended in mockery and derision. Thenceforward they continued quiet,\r\ntill taking advantage of our domestic division and civil wars, they\r\nstormed and seized the winter entrenchments of the legions, and aimed at\r\nthe dominion of Gaul; from whence they were once more expulsed, and in\r\nthe times preceding the present, we gained a triumph over them rather\r\nthan a victory.\r\n\r\nI must now proceed to speak of the Suevians, who are not, like the\r\nCattans and Tencterians, comprehended in a single people; but divided\r\ninto several nations all bearing distinct names, though, in general\r\nthey are entitled Suevians, and occupy the larger share of Germany. This\r\npeople are remarkable for a peculiar custom, that of twisting their hair\r\nand binding it up in a knot. It is thus the Suevians are distinguished\r\nfrom the other Germans, thus the free Suevians from their slaves. In\r\nother nations, whether from alliance of blood with the Suevians, or, as\r\nis usual, from imitation, this practice is also found, yet rarely, and\r\nnever exceeds the years of youth. The Suevians, even when their hair is\r\nwhite through age, continue to raise it backwards in a manner stern and\r\nstaring; and often tie it upon the top of their head only. That of their\r\nPrinces, is more accurately disposed, and so far they study to appear\r\nagreeable and comely; but without any culpable intention. For by\r\nit, they mean not to make love or to incite it: they thus dress when\r\nproceeding to war, and deck their heads so as to add to their height and\r\nterror in the eyes of the enemy.\r\n\r\nOf all the Suevians, the Semnones recount themselves to be the most\r\nancient and most noble. The belief of their antiquity is confirmed\r\nby religious mysteries. At a stated time of the year, all the several\r\npeople descended from the same stock, assemble by their deputies in\r\na wood; consecrated by the idolatries of their forefathers, and by\r\nsuperstitious awe in times of old. There by publicly sacrificing a man,\r\nthey begin the horrible solemnity of their barbarous worship. To this\r\ngrove another sort of reverence is also paid. No one enters it otherwise\r\nthan bound with ligatures, thence professing his subordination and\r\nmeanness, and the power of the Deity there. If he fall down, he is not\r\npermitted to rise or be raised, but grovels along upon the ground. And\r\nof all their superstition, this is the drift and tendency; that from\r\nthis place the nation drew their original, that here God, the supreme\r\nGovernor of the world, resides, and that all things else whatsoever\r\nare subject to him and bound to obey him. The potent condition of the\r\nSemnones has increased their influence and authority, as they inhabit an\r\nhundred towns; and from the largeness of their community it comes, that\r\nthey hold themselves for the head of the Suevians.\r\n\r\nWhat on the contrary ennobles the Langobards is the smallness of their\r\nnumber, for that they, who are surrounded with very many and very\r\npowerful nations, derive their security from no obsequiousness or\r\nplying; but from the dint of battle and adventurous deeds. There follow\r\nin order the Reudignians, and Aviones, and Angles, and Varinians, and\r\nEudoses, and Suardones and Nuithones; all defended by rivers or forests.\r\nNor in one of these nations does aught remarkable occur, only that they\r\nuniversally join in the worship of _Herthum_; that is to say, the Mother\r\nEarth. Her they believe to interpose in the affairs of men, and to visit\r\ncountries. In an island of the ocean stands the wood _Castum_; in it\r\nis a chariot dedicated to the Goddess, covered over with a curtain, and\r\npermitted to be touched by none but the Priest. Whenever the Goddess\r\nenters this her holy vehicle, he perceives her; and with profound\r\nveneration attends the motion of the chariot, which is always drawn by\r\nyoked cows. Then it is that days of rejoicing always ensue, and in all\r\nplaces whatsoever which she descends to honour with a visit and her\r\ncompany, feasts and recreation abound. They go not to war; they touch\r\nno arms; fast laid up is every hostile weapon; peace and repose are\r\nthen only known, then only beloved, till to the temple the same priest\r\nreconducts the Goddess when well tired with the conversation of mortal\r\nbeings. Anon the chariot is washed and purified in a secret lake, as\r\nalso the curtains; nay, the Deity herself too, if you choose to believe\r\nit. In this office it is slaves who minister, and they are forthwith\r\ndoomed to be swallowed up in the same lake. Hence all men are possessed\r\nwith mysterious terror; as well as with a holy ignorance what that must\r\nbe, which none see but such as are immediately to perish. Moreover this\r\nquarter of the Suevians stretches to the middle of Germany.\r\n\r\nThe community next adjoining, is that of the Hermondurians; (that I may\r\nnow follow the course of the Danube, as a little before I did that of\r\nthe Rhine) a people this, faithful to the Romans. So that to them alone\r\nof all the Germans, commerce is permitted; not barely upon the bank of\r\nthe Rhine, but more extensively, and even in that glorious colony in the\r\nprovince of Rhoetia. They travel everywhere at their own discretion and\r\nwithout a guard; and when to other nations, we show no more than our\r\narms and encampments, to this people we throw open our houses and\r\ndwellings, as to men who have no longing to possess them. In the\r\nterritories of the Hermondurians rises the Elbe, a river very famous and\r\nformerly well known to us; at present we only hear it named.\r\n\r\nClose by the Hermondurians reside the Nariscans, and next to them the\r\nMarcomanians and Quadians. Amongst these the Marcomanians are most\r\nsignal in force and renown; nay, their habitation itself they acquired\r\nby their bravery, as from thence they formerly expulsed the Boians. Nor\r\ndo the Nariscans or Quadians degenerate in spirit. Now this is as it\r\nwere the frontier of Germany, as far as Germany is washed by the Danube.\r\nTo the times within our memory the Marcomanians and Quadians were\r\ngoverned by kings, who were natives of their own, descended from the\r\nnoble line of Maroboduus and Tudrus. At present they are even subject to\r\nsuch as are foreigners. But the whole strength and sway of their kings\r\nis derived from the authority of the Romans. From our arms, they rarely\r\nreceive any aid; from our money very frequently.\r\n\r\nNor less powerful are the several people beyond them; namely, the\r\nMarsignians, the Gothinians, the Osians and the Burians, who altogether\r\nenclose the Marcomanians and Quadians behind. Of those, the Marsignians\r\nand the Burians in speech and dress resemble the Suevians. From the\r\nGallic language spoken by the Gothinians, and from that of Pannonia by\r\nthe Osians, it is manifest that neither of these people are Germans; as\r\nit is also from their bearing to pay tribute. Upon them as upon aliens\r\ntheir tribute is imposed, partly by the Sarmatians, partly by the\r\nQuadians. The Gothinians, to heighten their disgrace, are forced to\r\nlabour in the iron mines. By all these several nations but little level\r\ncountry is possessed: they are seated amongst forests, and upon\r\nthe ridges and declivities of mountains. For, Suevia is parted by a\r\ncontinual ridge of mountains; beyond which, live many distinct nations.\r\nOf these the Lygians are most numerous and extensive, and spread into\r\nseveral communities. It will suffice to mention the most puissant; even\r\nthe Arians, Helvicones, Manimians; Elysians and Naharvalians. Amongst\r\nthe Naharvalians is shown a grove, sacred to devotion extremely ancient.\r\nOver it a Priest presides apparelled like a woman; but according to\r\nthe explication of the Romans, 'tis _Castor_ and _Pollux_ who are here\r\nworshipped. This Divinity is named _Alcis_. There are indeed no images\r\nhere, no traces of an extraneous superstition: yet their devotion is\r\naddressed to young men and to brothers. Now the Aryans, besides their\r\nforces, in which they surpass the several nations just recounted, are\r\nin their persons stern and truculent; and even humour and improve their\r\nnatural grimness and ferocity by art and time. They wear black shields,\r\ntheir bodies are painted black, they choose dark nights for engaging in\r\nbattle; and by the very awe and ghastly hue of their army, strike the\r\nenemy with dread, as none can bear this their aspect so surprising and\r\nas it were quite infernal. For, in all battles the eyes are vanquished\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nBeyond the Lygians dwell the Gothones, under the rule of a King; and\r\nthence held in subjection somewhat stricter than the other German\r\nnations, yet not so strict as to extinguish all their liberty.\r\nImmediately adjoining are the Rugians and Lemovians upon the coast of\r\nthe ocean, and of these several nations the characteristics are a round\r\nshield, a short sword and kingly government. Next occur the communities\r\nof the Suiones, situated in the ocean itself; and besides their strength\r\nin men and arms, very powerful at sea. The form of their vessels varies\r\nthus far from ours, that they have prows at each end, so as to be always\r\nready to row to shore without turning; nor are they moved by sails, nor\r\non their sides have benches of oars placed, but the rowers ply here and\r\nthere in all parts of the ship alike, as in some rivers is done, and\r\nchange their oars from place to place, just as they shift their course\r\nhither or thither. To wealth also, amongst them, great veneration is\r\npaid, and thence a single ruler governs them, without all restriction of\r\npower, and exacting unlimited obedience. Neither here, as amongst other\r\nnations of Germany, are arms used indifferently by all, but shut up and\r\nwarded under the care of a particular keeper, who in truth too is always\r\na slave: since from all sudden invasions and attacks from their foes,\r\nthe ocean protects them: besides that armed bands, when they are not\r\nemployed, grow easily debauched and tumultuous. The truth is, it suits\r\nnot the interest of an arbitrary Prince, to trust the care and power of\r\narms either with a nobleman or with a freeman, or indeed with any man\r\nabove the condition of a slave.\r\n\r\nBeyond the Suiones is another sea, one very heavy and almost void\r\nof agitation; and by it the whole globe is thought to be bounded and\r\nenvironed, for that the reflection of the sun, after his setting,\r\ncontinues till his rising, so bright as to darken the stars. To this,\r\npopular opinion has added, that the tumult also of his emerging from\r\nthe sea is heard, that forms divine are then seen, as likewise the rays\r\nabout his head. Only thus far extend the limits of nature, if what fame\r\nsays be true. Upon the right of the Suevian Sea the Aestyan nations\r\nreside, who use the same customs and attire with the Suevians; their\r\nlanguage more resembles that of Britain. They worship the Mother of the\r\nGods. As the characteristic of their national superstition, they wear\r\nthe images of wild boars. This alone serves them for arms, this is the\r\nsafeguard of all, and by this every worshipper of the Goddess is secured\r\neven amidst his foes. Rare amongst them is the use of weapons of iron,\r\nbut frequent that of clubs. In producing of grain and the other fruits\r\nof the earth, they labour with more assiduity and patience than is\r\nsuitable to the usual laziness of Germans. Nay, they even search the\r\ndeep, and of all the rest are the only people who gather _amber_. They\r\ncall it _glasing_, and find it amongst the shallows and upon the very\r\nshore. But, according to the ordinary incuriosity and ignorance of\r\nBarbarians, they have neither learnt, nor do they inquire, what is\r\nits nature, or from what cause it is produced. In truth it lay long\r\nneglected amongst the other gross discharges of the sea; till from our\r\nluxury, it gained a name and value. To themselves it is of no use: they\r\ngather it rough, they expose it in pieces coarse and unpolished, and for\r\nit receive a price with wonder. You would however conceive it to be a\r\nliquor issuing from trees, for that in the transparent substance are\r\noften seen birds and other animals, such as at first stuck in the soft\r\ngum, and by it, as it hardened, became quite enclosed. I am apt to\r\nbelieve that, as in the recesses of the East are found woods and groves\r\ndropping frankincense and balms, so in the isles and continent of the\r\nWest such gums are extracted by the force and proximity of the sun; at\r\nfirst liquid and flowing into the next sea, then thrown by winds and\r\nwaves upon the opposite shore. If you try the nature of amber by the\r\napplication of fire, it kindles like a torch; and feeds a thick and\r\nunctuous flame very high scented, and presently becomes glutinous like\r\npitch or rosin.\r\n\r\nUpon the Suiones, border the people Sitones; and, agreeing with them in\r\nall other things, differ from them in one, that here the sovereignty is\r\nexercised by a woman. So notoriously do they degenerate not only from\r\na state of liberty, but even below a state of bondage. Here end the\r\nterritories of the Suevians.\r\n\r\nWhether amongst the Sarmatians or the Germans I ought to account the\r\nPeucinians, the Venedians, and the Fennians, is what I cannot determine;\r\nthough the Peucinians, whom some call Basstarnians, speak the same\r\nlanguage with the Germans, use the same attire, build like them, and\r\nlive like them, in that dirtiness and sloth so common to all.\r\nSomewhat they are corrupted into the fashion of the Sarmatians by the\r\nintermarriages of the principal sort with that nation: from whence\r\nthe Venedians have derived very many of their customs and a great\r\nresemblance. For they are continually traversing and infesting with\r\nrobberies all the forests and mountains lying between the Peucinians\r\nand Fennians. Yet they are rather reckoned amongst the Germans, for\r\nthat they have fixed houses, and carry shields, and prefer travelling\r\non foot, and excel in swiftness. Usages these, all widely differing from\r\nthose of the Sarmatians, who live on horseback and dwell in waggons.\r\nIn wonderful savageness live the nation of the Fennians, and in beastly\r\npoverty, destitute of arms, of horses, and of homes; their food, the\r\ncommon herbs; their apparel, skins; their bed, the earth; their only\r\nhope in their arrows, which for want of iron they point with bones.\r\nTheir common support they have from the chase, women as well as men;\r\nfor with these the former wander up and down, and crave a portion of\r\nthe prey. Nor other shelter have they even for their babes, against the\r\nviolence of tempests and ravening beasts, than to cover them with the\r\nbranches of trees twisted together: this a reception for the old men,\r\nand hither resort the young. Such a condition they judge more happy than\r\nthe painful occupation of cultivating the ground, than the labour of\r\nrearing houses, than the agitations of hope and fear attending the\r\ndefence of their own property or the seizing that of others. Secure\r\nagainst the designs of men, secure against the malignity of the Gods,\r\nthey have accomplished a thing of infinite difficulty; that to them\r\nnothing remains even to be wished.\r\n\r\nWhat further accounts we have are fabulous: as that the Hellusians and\r\nOxiones have the countenances and aspect of men, with the bodies and\r\nlimbs of savage beasts. This, as a thing about which I have no certain\r\ninformation, I shall leave untouched.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIFE OF AGRICOLA, WITH AN ACCOUNT OF THE SITUATION, CLIMATE, AND\r\nPEOPLE OF BRITAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmongst the Ancients, it was common to transmit to posterity the\r\ncharacters and exploits of memorable men: nor in truth in our own times\r\nhas the Age, however indifferent about what concerns itself, failed to\r\nobserve the like usage, whenever any spirit eminent for great and signal\r\nvirtue has vanquished and triumphed over the blindness of such as cannot\r\ndistinguish right from wrong, as well as over the spite of malignants;\r\nfor, spite and blindness are evils common to great States and to small.\r\nBut, as in those early times there was found greater propensity to feats\r\nof renown, and more scope to perform them; so whoever excelled in a\r\nhappy genius was naturally led to display the merits and memory of the\r\nvirtuous dead, without all view to court favour, or to gain advantages,\r\nbut only by the motives and recompense flowing from a benevolent and\r\nconscientious mind. Indeed there were several who, in recounting their\r\nown lives, concluded, that they thence showed rather a confidence in\r\ntheir own integrity and demeanour than any mark of arrogance. Neither\r\nwas the account which Rutilius and Scaurus gave of themselves, thence\r\nthe less credited or the more censured. So true it is, that the several\r\nvirtues are best understood and most prized, during the same times in\r\nwhich they are most easily produced. But to myself, who am going to\r\nrelate the life of a person deceased, I find pardon necessary; which I\r\nshould not have asked, were I not about to revive and traverse times so\r\nsanguinary, and baneful to all virtue.\r\n\r\nWe find it recorded, that for celebrating the praises of Paetus Thrasea,\r\nArulenus Rusticus suffered a deadly doom; as did Herennius Senesce, for\r\nthose of Helvidius Priscus. Nor upon the persons of the authors only was\r\nthis cruelty inflicted, but also upon the books themselves; since to the\r\nTriumvirate of Justice orders were sent, that in the Forum and place of\r\npopular elections, the works of men so illustrious for parts and genius\r\nshould be burned. Yes, in this very fire they imagined, that they should\r\nabolish the voice and utterance of the Roman People, with the liberty of\r\nthe Senate, and all the ideas and remembrances of humankind. For, they\r\nhad besides expelled all the professors of philosophy, [Footnote:\r\nWhen Vespasian's worthless son \"cleared Rome of what most sham'd him:\"\r\nDomitian banished Epictetus, and the other philosophers.] and driven\r\nevery laudable science into exile, that nought which was worthy and\r\nhonest might anywhere be seen. Mighty surely was the testimony which\r\nwe gave of our patience; and as our forefathers had beheld the ultimate\r\nconsummation of liberty, so did we of bondage, since through dread\r\nof informers and inquisitions of State, we were bereft of the common\r\nintercourse of speech and attention. Nay, with our utterance we had\r\nlikewise lost our memory; had it been equally in our power to forget, as\r\nto be silent.\r\n\r\nNow indeed at length our spirit returns. Yet, though from the first dawn\r\nof this very happy age begun by the reign of Nerva, he blended together\r\ntwo things once found irreconcilable, public liberty and sovereign\r\npower; and though Trajan his adopted successor be daily augmenting the\r\nfelicity of the State; insomuch that for the general security not only\r\nhopes and vows are conceived, but even firm assurance follows these\r\nvows, and their full accomplishment is seen; such however is the frailty\r\nof man and its effects, that much more slow is the progress of the\r\nremedies than of the evils; and as human bodies attain their growth by\r\ntedious degrees, and are subject to be destroyed in an instant, so it is\r\nmuch easier to suppress than to revive the efforts of genius and study.\r\nFor, upon the mind there steals a pleasure even in sloth and remissness,\r\nand that very inactivity which was at first hated, is at last loved.\r\nWill it not be found that during a course of fifteen years (a mighty\r\nspace in the age of mortal man) numbers perished through fortuitous\r\ndisasters, and all men noted for promptness and spirit were cut off by\r\nthe cruelty of the Emperor? Few we are, who have escaped; and if I may\r\nso speak, we have survived not only others but even ourselves, when from\r\nthe middle of our life so many years were rent; whence from being young\r\nwe are arrived at old age, from being old we are nigh come to the utmost\r\nverge of mortality, all in a long course of awful silence. I shall\r\nhowever find no cause of regret from having framed an historical\r\ndeduction of our former bondage, as also a testimony of the public\r\nblessings which at present we enjoy; though, in doing it, my style be\r\nnegligent and unpolished. To the honour of Agricola my wife's father,\r\nthis present book is in the meantime dedicated; and, as 'tis a\r\ndeclaration of filial duty and affection, will thence be commended, at\r\nleast excused.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA.D. 40. Cnaeus Julius Agricola was born in the ancient and illustrious\r\nColony of Forojulium, [Footnote: Fréjus.] and both his grandfathers were\r\nProcurators to the Emperors; a dignity peculiar to the Equestrian Order.\r\nHis father Julius Graecinus was a Senator, and noted for eloquence and\r\nphilosophy. By these his virtues, he earned the wrath of Caligula. For,\r\nhe was by him ordered to accuse Marcus Silanus, and put to death for\r\nrefusing. His mother was Julia Procilla, a lady of singular chastity.\r\nUnder her eye and tender care he was reared, and spent his childhood\r\nand youth in the continual pursuit and cultivation of worthy\r\naccomplishments. What guarded him from the allurements of the vicious\r\n(besides his own virtuous disposition and natural innocence) was, that\r\nfor the seat and nursery of his studies, whilst yet very little, he had\r\nthe city of Marseilles; a place well tempered and framed, as in it\r\nall the politeness of the Greeks and all the provincial parsimony are\r\nblended together. I remember he was wont to declare, that in his early\r\nyouth he studied Philosophy and the Law with more avidity than was\r\nallowable to a Roman and a Senator; till the discretion of his mother\r\nchecked his spirit, engaged with passion and ardour in the pursuit. In\r\ntruth, his superior and elevated genius thirsted, with more vehemence\r\nthan caution, after the loveliness and lustre of a name and renown so\r\nmighty and sublime. Reason and age afterwards qualified his heat; and,\r\nwhat is a task extremely hard, he satisfied himself with a limited\r\nmeasure of philosophy.\r\n\r\nA.D. 59-62. The first rudiments of war he learnt in Britain, under that\r\nprudent and vigilant commander Suetonius Paulinus; by whom he was chosen\r\nand distinguished, as his domestic companion. Neither did Agricola\r\nbehave licentiously, after the manner of young men, who turn warfare\r\ninto riot; nor assumed the title and office of a Tribune without the\r\nsufficiency, in order to use it slothfully in feats of pleasure and\r\nabsence from duty, but to know the Province, to be known to the army,\r\nto learn of such as had experience, to follow such as were worthy and\r\nbrave, to seek for no exploits for ostentation, to refuse none through\r\nfear, and in all his pursuits was equally zealous and active. Indeed\r\nat no time had Britain been under greater combustions, nor our affairs\r\nthere more precarious. Our veterans were slaughtered, our colonies\r\nburned down, our armies surprised and taken. At that juncture the\r\nstruggle was for life; afterwards, for victory. Now though all these\r\naffairs were transacted by the counsels and conduct of another than\r\nAgricola, and though the stress of the whole, with the glory of\r\nrecovering the Province, accrued to the General; they all however proved\r\nto the young man matters of skill, of experience and stimulation; and\r\nthere seized his soul a passion for military glory, a spirit disgustful\r\nto the times, when of men signally eminent a malignant opinion was\r\nentertained, and when as much peril arose from a great character as from\r\na bad.\r\n\r\nA.D. 62-68. Departing from hence to Rome for the exercise of public\r\ndignities, he there married Domitia Decidiana, a lady splendid in her\r\ndescent; and to him, who was aspiring to higher honours, this marriage\r\nproved a great ornament and support. In marvellous unanimity they also\r\nlived, in a course of mutual tenderness and mutual preference; a temper\r\ncommendable in both, only that the praise of a good wife rises in\r\nproportion to the contumely of a bad. His lot as Quaestor fell upon\r\nAsia, where he had Salvius Titianus for Proconsul. But neither the\r\nProvince nor the Proconsul corrupted his probity, though the country\r\nwas very rich, nay, prepared as a prey for men corruptly disposed;\r\nand Titianus, a man bent upon all acts of rapine, was ready, upon\r\nthe smallest encouragement, to have purchased a mutual connivance in\r\niniquity. In Asia he was enriched by the birth of a daughter, tending at\r\nonce to his consolation and the support of his family; for the son born\r\nto him before, he very soon lost. The interval between his bearing the\r\noffice of Quaestor and that of Tribune of the People, and even the year\r\nof his Tribuneship, he passed in repose and inactivity; as well aware of\r\nthe spirit of the times under Nero, when sloth and heaviness served for\r\nwisdom. With the like indolence he held the Praetorship, and in the same\r\nquiet and silence. For upon him the jurisdiction of that dignity fell\r\nnot. The public pastimes and the empty gaieties of the office, he\r\nexhibited according to the rules of good sense and to the measure of\r\nhis wealth, in a manner though remote from prodigality, yet deserving\r\npopular applause. As he was next appointed by Galba to make research\r\ninto the gifts and oblations appertaining to the temples, he proceeded\r\nwith such diligence and an examination so strict, that the State\r\nsuffered from no sacrilege save that of Nero.\r\n\r\nA.D. 69 and 70. In the year following he suffered a grievous blow in his\r\nspirit and family. For, Otho's fleet, which continued roving upon\r\nthe coast and pursuing rapine, whilst they were ravaging Intemelium\r\n[Footnote: Vinitimiglia.] (a part of Liguria) slew the mother of\r\nAgricola upon her estate there, and plundered the estate itself with\r\na great part of her treasure, which had indeed proved the cause of the\r\nmurder. As he therefore went from Rome to solemnise her funeral, he had\r\ntidings upon the road that Vespasian was pursuing the sovereignty, and\r\ninstantly espoused his party. In the beginning of this reign all the\r\nexercise of power and the government of the city, were entirely in the\r\nhands of Mucianus; for, Domitian was yet extremely young, and, of the\r\nImperial fortune of his father, assumed nothing further than a latitude\r\nfor debauchery. Mucianus, who had despatched Agricola to levy forces,\r\nand found him to have acted in that trust with uprightness and\r\nmagnanimity, preferred him to the command of the twentieth legion; as\r\nsoon as he was informed, that he who commanded it before was engaged\r\nin seditious practices. Indeed that legion had with great slowness and\r\nreluctance been brought to swear allegiance to Vespasian, nay, was grown\r\nover mighty and even formidable to the commanders-in-chief: so that\r\ntheir own commander was found void of authority to control them; though\r\nit is uncertain whether from the temper of the man or from that of\r\nthe soldiers. Thus Agricola was chosen, at once to succeed him, and to\r\npunish delinquency in them; and exercising moderation altogether rare,\r\nwould rather have it thought, that he had found them unblamable than\r\nmade them so.\r\n\r\nA.D. 72. Over Britain at that juncture Vettius Bolanus bore rule, but\r\nwith more complacency than suited a province so fierce and untamed.\r\nHence Agricola restrained his own heat, and held within bounds the\r\nardour of his spirit, as he was well skilled how to show his obedience,\r\nand had thoroughly learned to blend what was honourable with what was\r\nprofitable: soon after this, Britain received for its Governor Petilius\r\nCerialis, one of Consular quality. The virtue and abilities of Agricola\r\nhad now ample space for producing suitable effects. But to him at first\r\nCerialis communicated only the dangers and fatigues: with him anon\r\nhe likewise shared the glory; frequently, for trial of his prowess,\r\ncommitted to his conduct a part of the army; sometimes, according to the\r\nmeasure of his success, set him at the head of forces still larger.\r\nNor did Agricola ever vaunt his exploits to blazon his own fame. To his\r\ngeneral, as to the Author of all, he, as his instrument and inferior,\r\nstill ascribed his good fortune. Thus from his bravery in the execution\r\nof his orders, from his modesty in recounting his deeds of bravery, he\r\nescaped envy, yet failed not to gain glory.\r\n\r\nA.D. 73-78. Upon his return from commanding a legion, the deified\r\nVespasian raised him to the rank of a patrician, and afterwards invested\r\nhim with the government of the Province of Aquitaine; a government of\r\nthe foremost dignity, and given as previous to the Consulship, to\r\nwhich that Prince had destined him. There are many who believe, that\r\nto military men subtilty of spirit is wanting; for that in camps\r\nthe direction of process and authority, is rather rough and void of\r\nformality; and that where hands and force are chiefly used, there the\r\naddress and refinements usual to Courts are not exercised. Yet Agricola,\r\nassisted by his natural prudence, though he was then engaged only with\r\nmen of peace and the robe, acquitted himself with great facility and\r\ngreat uprightness. He carefully distinguished the seasons of business\r\nand the seasons of recess. Whenever he sat in Council or upon the\r\nTribunals of justice, he was grave, attentive, awful, generally addicted\r\nto compassion. The moment he had fulfilled the duties of his office,\r\nhe personated no longer the man of power: he had then cast off all\r\nsternness, all airs of State, and all rigour. Nay, what is very rarely\r\nto be seen, his complaisance neither weakened his authority, nor did his\r\nseverity make him less amiable. It were an injury to the virtues of so\r\ngreat a man, to particularise his just dealings, his temperance, and\r\nthe cleanness of his hands. [Footnote: \"Integritatem atque abstinentiam\r\nreferre.\"] In truth glory itself was what he pursued, not by any\r\nostentation of bravery, nor by any strain of artifice or address; though\r\nof that pursuit even the best men are often fond. Thus he was far from\r\nmaintaining any competition with his equals in station, far from any\r\ncontest with the Procurators of the Prince: since, to conquer in this\r\ncontention he judged to be no glory; and to be crushed by them were\r\ndisgrace. His administration here lasted hardly three years, ere he\r\nwas recalled to the present possession of the Consulship. With this\r\nemployment there accrued the public opinion, that for his province\r\nBritain would be assigned him, from no words which had dropped from him\r\nabout it, but because he was deemed equal to the office. Common fame\r\ndoes not always err; sometimes it even directs the public choice. To\r\nmyself yet very young, whilst he was Consul, he contracted his daughter,\r\na young lady even then of excellent hopes, and, at the end of his\r\nConsulship, presented her in marriage. He was then forthwith promoted\r\nto the government of Britain, as also invested with the honour of the\r\nPontificate.\r\n\r\nThe account which I shall here present of the situation and people of\r\nBritain, a subject about which many authors have written, comes not from\r\nany design of setting up my own exactness and genius against theirs, but\r\nonly because the country was then first thoroughly subdued. So that such\r\nmatters as former writers have, without knowing them, embellished with\r\neloquence, will by me be recounted according to the truth of evidence\r\nand discoveries. Of all the islands which have reached the knowledge of\r\nthe Romans, Britain is the largest. It extends towards Germany to the\r\neast, towards Spain to the west. To the south it looks towards Gaul. Its\r\nnorthern shore, beyond which there is no land, is beaten by a sea vast\r\nand boundless. [Footnote: \"Belluosus, qui remotis Obstrepit Oceanus\r\nBritannis.\"] Britain is by Livy and Fabius Rusticus, the former the most\r\neloquent of the ancient historians, the latter of the moderns, compared\r\nin shape to an oblong shield, or a broad knife with two edges. And such\r\nin effect is its figure on this side Caledonia, whence common opinion\r\nhas thus also fashioned the whole. But a tract of territory huge and\r\nunmeasurable stretches forward to the uttermost shore, and straitening\r\nby degrees, terminates like a wedge. Round the coast of this sea, which\r\nbeyond it has no land, the Roman fleet now first sailed, and thence\r\nproved Britain to be an island, as also discovered and subdued the Isles\r\nof Orkney till then unknown. Thule was likewise descried, hitherto\r\nhid by winter under eternal snow. This sea they report to be slow and\r\nstagnate, difficult to the rowers, and indeed hardly to be raised by\r\nthe force of winds. This I conjecture to be because land and mountains,\r\nwhich are the cause and materials of tempests, very rarely occur in\r\nproportion to the mighty mass of water, a mass so deep and uninterrupted\r\nas not to be easily agitated. An inquiry into the nature of the ocean\r\nand of the tide, is not the purpose of this work, and about it many have\r\nwritten. One thing I would add, that nowhere is the power of the sea\r\nmore extensive than here, forcing back the waters of many rivers, or\r\ncarrying them away with its own; nor is its flux and ebbings confined to\r\nthe banks and shore; but it works and winds itself far into the country,\r\nnay forms bays in rocks and mountains, as if the same were its native\r\nbed.\r\n\r\nFor the rest; who were the first inhabitants of Britain, whether natives\r\nof its own, or foreigners, can be little known amongst a people thus\r\nbarbarous. In their looks and persons they vary; from whence arguments\r\nand inferences are formed. For, the red hair of the Caledonians and\r\ntheir large limbs, testify their descent to be from Germany. The swarthy\r\ncomplexion of the Silures, and their hair, which is generally curled,\r\nwith their situation opposite to the coast of Spain, furnish ground to\r\nbelieve, that the ancient Iberians had arrived from thence here, and\r\ntaken possession of the territory. They who live next to Gaul are also\r\nlike the Gauls; whether it be that the spirit of the original stock\r\nfrom which they sprang, still remains, or whether in countries\r\nnear adjoining, the genius of the climate confers the same form and\r\ndisposition upon the bodies of men. To one who considers the whole,\r\nit seems however credible, that the Gauls at first occupied this their\r\nneighbouring coast. That their sacred rites are the same, you may learn\r\nfrom their being possessed with the same superstition of every sort.\r\nTheir speech does not much vary. In daring and dangers they are prompted\r\nby the like boldness, and with the like affright avoid them when they\r\napproach. In the Britons however superior ferocity and defiance is\r\nfound, as in a people not yet softened by a long peace. For we learn\r\nfrom history, that the Gauls too flourished in warlike prowess and\r\nrenown: amongst them afterwards, together with peace and idleness, there\r\nentered effeminacy; and thus with the loss of their liberty they lost\r\ntheir spirit and magnanimity. The same happened to those of the Britons\r\nwho were conquered long ago. The rest still continue such as the Gauls\r\nonce were.\r\n\r\nTheir principal force consists in their foot. Some nations amongst them\r\nmake also war in chariots. The more honourable person always drives:\r\nunder his leading his followers fight. They were formerly subject to\r\nKings. They are now swayed by several chiefs, and rent into factions and\r\nparties, according to the humour and passions of those their leaders.\r\nNor against nations thus powerful does aught so much avail us, as that\r\nthey consult not in a body for the security of the whole. It is rare\r\nthat two or three communities assemble and unite to repulse any public\r\ndanger threatening to all. So that whilst only a single community fought\r\nat a time, they were every one vanquished. The sky from frequent clouds\r\nand rain is dull and hazy. Excessive cold they feel not. Their days in\r\nlength surpass ours. Their nights are very clear, and at the extremity\r\nof the country, very short; so that between the setting and return of\r\nthe day, you perceive but small interval. They affirm, that were it not\r\nfor the intervention of clouds, the rays of the sun would be seen in the\r\nnight, and that he doth not rise and fall, but only pass by: for that\r\nthe extremities of the earth, which are level, yielding but a low\r\nshadow, prevent darkness from rising high and spreading; and thence\r\nnight is far short of reaching the stars and the sky. The soil is such,\r\nthat except the olive and the vine, and other vegetables, which are wont\r\nto be raised in hotter climes, it readily bears all fruits and grain,\r\nand is very fertile. It quickly produces, but its productions ripen\r\nslowly; and of both these effects there is the same cause, the extreme\r\nhumidity of the earth and of the sky. Britain yields gold and silver,\r\nwith other metals, all which prove the prize and reward of the\r\nConquerors. The sea also breeds pearls, but of a dark and livid hue,\r\na defect by some ascribed to the unskilfulness of such as gather them.\r\nFor, in the Red Sea they are pulled from the rocks alive and vigorous.\r\nIn Britain they are gathered at random, such as the sea casts them\r\nupon the shore. For myself; I am much apter to believe, that nature\r\nhas failed to give the pearls perfection, than that we fail in avarice.\r\n[Footnote: \"Ego facilius crediderim naturam margaritis de esse; quam\r\nnobis avaritiam.\"]\r\n\r\nThe Britons themselves are a people who cheerfully comply with the\r\nlevies of men, and with the imposition of taxes, and with all the duties\r\nenjoined by Government; provided they receive no illegal treatment and\r\ninsults from their governors: those they bear with impatience. Nor have\r\nthe Romans any further subdued them than only to obey just laws, but\r\nnever to submit to be slaves. Even the deified Julius Caesar, the first\r\nof all the Romans who entered Britain with an army, though by gaining\r\na battle he frightened the natives, and became master of the coast;\r\n[Footnote: Caesar conquered to the north of the Thames.] yet may be\r\nthought to have rather presented posterity with a view of the country,\r\nthan to have conveyed down the possession. Anon the civil wars ensued,\r\nand against the Commonwealth were turned the arms of her own chiefs\r\nand leaders. Thus Britain was long forgot, and continued to be so even\r\nduring peace. This was what Augustus called _Reason of State_, but what\r\nTiberius styled the _Ordinance of Augustus_. That Caligula meditated an\r\ninvasion of Britain in person, is well known: but he possessed a\r\nspirit, as precipitate and wild, so presently surfeited with any design\r\nwhatever; besides that all his mighty efforts against Germany were\r\nquite baffled. The deified Claudius accomplished the undertaking; having\r\nthither transported the legions, with a number of auxiliary forces, and\r\nassociated Vespasian into the direction of the design: an incident which\r\nproved the introduction to his approaching fortune. There, nations were\r\nsubdued, Kings taken captive, and Vespasian placed to advantage in the\r\neye of the Fates.\r\n\r\nThe first Governor of Consular quality, was Aulus Plautius, then\r\nOstorius Scapula, both signal in war: and by degrees the nearest part\r\nof Britain was reduced into the condition of a Province. To secure it,\r\na colony of veterans was likewise settled. To the British King Cogidunus\r\ncertain communities were given, a Prince who even till our times\r\ncontinued in perfect fidelity to us. For, with the Roman People it is a\r\ncustom long since received, and practised of old, that for establishing\r\nthe bondage of nations, they are to employ even Kings as their\r\ninstruments. Afterwards followed Didius Gallus, and just preserved what\r\nacquisitions his predecessors had made; only that further in the island\r\nhe raised some forts, and very few they were, purely for the name and\r\nopinion of having enlarged his government. Next to Didius came Veranius,\r\nand died in less than a year. Then immediately succeeded Suetonius\r\nPaulinus, who during two years commanded with success, subdued fresh\r\nnations and established garrisons. Trusting to these he went to assail\r\nthe Isle of Anglesey, as a place which supplied the revolters with\r\nsuccours, and thus left the country behind him exposed to the enemy.\r\n\r\nFor, the Britons, when through the absence of the Governor they were\r\neased of their fear, began to commune together concerning the miseries\r\nof bondage, to recount their several grievances, and so to construe and\r\nheighten their injuries as effectually to inflame their resentments.\r\n\"Their patience,\" they said, \"availed them nothing, further than to\r\ninvite the imposition of heavier burdens upon a people who thus tamely\r\nbore any. In times past they had only a single King: they were now\r\nsurrendered to two. One of these the Governor-General, tyrannised over\r\ntheir bodies and lives; the Imperial Procurator, who was the other, over\r\ntheir substance and fortunes. Equally pernicious to their subjects was\r\nany variance between these their rulers, as their good intelligence and\r\nunanimity. Against them the one employed his own predatory bands, as\r\ndid the other his Centurions and their men; and both exercised violence\r\nalike, both treated them with equal insults and contumely. To such\r\nheight was oppression grown, that nothing whatever was exempt from their\r\navarice, nothing whatever from their lust. He who in the day of battle\r\nspoiled others, was always stronger than they. But here it was chiefly\r\nby the cowardly and effeminate that their houses were seized, their\r\nchildren forced away, and their men obliged to enlist; as if their\r\ncountry were the only thing for which the Britons knew not how to die.\r\nIn truth, what a small force would all the soldiers arrived in the\r\nisland appear; would the Britons but compute their own numbers? It\r\nwas from this consideration that Germany had thrown off the same yoke,\r\nthough a country defended only by a river, and not like this, by the\r\nocean. To animate themselves to take arms, they had their country, their\r\nwives, their parents; whilst these their oppressors were prompted\r\nby nothing but their avarice and sensuality: nor would they fail to\r\nwithdraw from the island, as even the deified Julius had withdrawn,\r\nwould the natives but imitate the bravery of their forefathers, and not\r\nbe dismayed with the issue of an encounter or two. Amongst people like\r\nthemselves reduced to misery, superior ardour was ever found, as also\r\ngreater firmness and perseverance. Towards the Britons, at this juncture\r\neven the Gods manifested compassion, since they thus kept the Roman\r\nGeneral at such a distance, thus held the Roman army confined in\r\nanother island. Nay, already they themselves had gained a point the most\r\ndifficult to be gained, that they could now deliberate about measures\r\ncommon to all: for, doubtless more perilous it were to be discovered\r\nforming such counsels, than openly to put them in execution.\"\r\n\r\nWhen with these and the like reasons they had instigated one another,\r\nthey unanimously took arms under the leading of Boudicea, [Footnote:\r\nBoadicea.] a woman of royal descent; for, in conferring sovereignty,\r\nthey make no distinction of sexes. They then forthwith assailed on every\r\nside the soldiers dispersed here and there in forts, and having stormed\r\nand sacked the several garrisons, fell upon the colony itself, as\r\nthe seat and centre of public servitude: nor was any kind of cruelty\r\nomitted, with which rage and victory could possibly inspire the hearts\r\nof Barbarians. In truth, had not Paulinus, upon learning the revolt of\r\nthe Province, come with notable speed to its relief, Britain had been\r\nlost. Yet by the success of a single battle, he reduced the country to\r\nits old subjection, though several continued in arms, such namely as\r\nwere conscious of inciting the rebellion, and under personal dread from\r\nthe spirit of the Governor. He, though otherwise a signal commander, yet\r\ntreated such as had surrendered themselves in a manner very imperious;\r\nand, as one who likewise avenged his own particular injury, thence\r\nexerted the greater rigour. Insomuch that in his room Petronius\r\nTurpilianus was sent, as one whose behaviour would prove more relenting,\r\none who being unacquainted with the delinquencies of the enemies, would\r\nbe more gentle in accepting their remorse and submission. Turpilianus,\r\nwhen he had quite appeased the late commotions, ventured upon nothing\r\nfurther, and then delivered the Province to Trebellius Maximus. He,\r\nstill more unwarlike and inactive than his predecessor, and nowise\r\ntrained in camps and armies, maintained the tranquillity of the Province\r\nby a method of softness and complaisance. The Barbarians had now\r\nlikewise learned to forgive such vices as humoured them in pleasure and\r\nease. Moreover, the civil wars which then intervened, furnished a proper\r\nexcuse for the lazy behaviour of the Governor. But he found himself\r\ngreatly embarrassed with faction and discord; for that the soldiers, who\r\nhad ever been inured to expeditions and feats in the field, were through\r\nidleness grown turbulent and licentious. Trebellius, by flight and\r\nlurking, escaped the present fury of the army: he afterwards resumed the\r\ncommand, but with an authority altogether precarious, without all spirit\r\nand destitute of all dignity; as if between him and them articles\r\nhad been settled, that the soldiers should retain their licentious\r\nbehaviour, and the General be permitted to enjoy his life. During this\r\nmutiny no blood was spilled. Neither did Vettius Bolanus, as the civil\r\nwar yet subsisted, exert any discipline in Britain. Towards the enemy\r\nthere still remained the same sloth and negligence, with the same\r\ninsolent spirit in the camp: this difference only there was, that\r\nBolanus was a man perfectly innocent; and being subject to no hate, as\r\nhe was free from all crimes, he had instead of authority over them, only\r\ngained their affections.\r\n\r\nBut, when Vespasian had, with the possession of the world, also\r\nrecovered Britain, in it were seen great commanders, noble armies, and\r\nthe hopes of the enemy quite abated, Petilius Cerialis, particularly,\r\nat his first entrance, struck them at once with general terror, by\r\nattacking the community of the Brigantes, reckoned the most populous of\r\nthe whole Province. There followed many encounters, such as sometimes\r\nproved very bloody. So that he held most part of their country as\r\nhis conquest, or continued to ravage it by war. In truth, though the\r\nexploits of Cerialis would have eclipsed the vigilance and fame of any\r\nother successor, yet Julius Frontinus sustained in his turn the mighty\r\ntask; and, as he was a man as great and able as he found scope and\r\nsafety to be, he by the sword utterly subdued the powerful and warlike\r\nnation of the Silures; though besides the bravery of the enemy, he\r\nwas likewise obliged to struggle with the difficulties of places and\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nA.D. 78. Such was the condition in which Agricola found Britain, such to\r\nhave been the vicissitudes of the war there, upon his arrival about the\r\nmiddle of summer, a time when the Roman soldiers, supposing the service\r\nof the season to be concluded, were securely bent upon inaction and\r\nrepose, as were the enemy upon any opportunity to annoy the Romans. The\r\nCommunity of the Ordovicans had not long before his coming slaughtered,\r\nalmost entirely, a band of horse stationed upon their confines; and by\r\nan essay so notable the Province in general became roused; while such as\r\nwere intent upon present war, commended the action as an example and a\r\ncall to the whole, and others were for delaying till they had discovered\r\nthe spirit of the new Lieutenant-General. Now though the summer\r\nwas over, though the troops were severed and lay dispersed over the\r\nProvince, though the soldiers had assured themselves of rest for the\r\nresidue of the year (a heavy obstacle and very discouraging to one who\r\nis commencing war), nay, though many judged it better only to guard the\r\nplaces which were threatened and precarious; yet Agricola determined to\r\nmeet the danger. Hence drawing together the choice bands of the legions,\r\nwith a small body of auxiliaries, he led them against the Ordovicans;\r\nand as these dared not descend into equal ground, he, who by sharing\r\nequal danger, would inspire his men with equal courage, marching in\r\nperson before his army, conducted them to the encounter upon the ascent.\r\nAlmost the whole nation was here cut off; but as he was well aware, that\r\nit behoved him to urge and maintain this his fame, and that with the\r\nissue of his first attempts all the rest would correspond, he conceived\r\na design to reduce the Isle of Anglesey, a conquest from which\r\nPaulinus was recalled by the general revolt of Britain, as above I have\r\nrecounted. But, as this counsel was suddenly concerted, and therefore\r\nships were found wanting, such was the firmness and capacity of the\r\nGeneral, that without ships he transported his men. From the auxiliaries\r\nhe detached all their chosen men, such as knew the fords, and according\r\nto the usage of their country were dexterous in swimming, so as, in the\r\nwater, at once to manage themselves, and their horses and arms. These,\r\nunencumbered with any of their baggage, he caused to make a descent and\r\nonset so sudden, that the enemy were quite struck with consternation,\r\nas men who apprehended nothing but a fleet and transports, and a\r\nformal invasion by sea, and now believed no enterprise difficult and\r\ninsurmountable to such as came thus determined to war. Thus they sued\r\nfor peace and even surrendered the island; and thence Agricola was\r\nalready considered as a very great and even renowned commander: for\r\nthat, at his first entrance into the Province, a time which other\r\ngovernors are wont to waste in show and parade, or in courting\r\ncompliment and addresses, he preferred feats of labour and of peril.\r\nNor did he apply this his good fortune and success to any purpose of\r\nvainglory: so that upon the bridling of such as were vanquished before,\r\nhe would not bestow the title of an expedition or of victory; nor in\r\ntruth would he so much as with the bare honour of the laurel distinguish\r\nthese his exploits. But even by disguising his fame, he enlarged it; as\r\nmen considered how vast must be his future views, when he thus smothered\r\nin silence deeds so noble.\r\n\r\nFor the rest; as he was acquainted with the temper of the people in\r\nhis Province; as he had also learned from the conduct and experience of\r\nothers, that little is gained by arms where grievances and oppressions\r\nfollow, he determined to cut off all the causes of war. Beginning\r\ntherefore with himself and those appertaining to him, he checked and\r\nregulated his own household; a task which to many proves not less\r\ndifficult than that of governing a province. By none of his domestics,\r\nbond or freed, was aught that concerned the public transacted. In\r\nraising the soldiers to a superior class, he was swayed by no personal\r\ninterest or partiality, nor by the recommendation and suit of the\r\nCenturions, but by his own opinion and persuasion, that the best\r\nsoldiers were ever the most faithful. All that passed he would know;\r\nthough all that was amiss he would not punish. Upon small offences he\r\nbestowed pardon; for such as were great he exercised proportionable\r\nseverity. Nor did he always exact the punishment assigned, but\r\nfrequently was satisfied with compunction and remorse. In conferring\r\noffices and employments he rather chose men who would not transgress,\r\nthan such as he must afterwards condemn for transgressing. Though the\r\nimposition of tribute and of grain had been augmented, yet he softened\r\nit by causing a just and equal distribution of all public burdens;\r\nsince he abolished whatever exactions had been devised for the lucre of\r\nparticulars, and were therefore borne with more regret than the\r\ntribute itself. For, the inhabitants were forced to bear the mockery\r\nof attending at their own barns, locked up by the publicans, and\r\nof purchasing their own corn of the monopolists, nay, of selling it\r\nafterwards back again at a poor price. They were moreover enjoined to\r\ntake long journeys, and carry grain across the several countries to\r\nplaces extremely distant; insomuch that the several communities, instead\r\nof supplying the winter-quarters which lay adjoining, must furnish such\r\nas were remote and difficultly travelled, to the end, that what was easy\r\nto be had by all, might produce gain to a few.\r\n\r\nA.D. 79. By suppressing these grievances immediately in his first year,\r\nhe gained a high character to a state of peace; a state which, either\r\nthrough the neglect or connivance of his predecessors, was till then\r\ndreaded no less than that of war. But, upon the coming of summer, he\r\nassembled his army; then proceeded to commend such of the men who in\r\nmarching observed their duty and rank, and to check such as were loose\r\nand straggling. He himself always chose the ground for encamping: the\r\nsalt marshes, friths, and woods he himself always first examined, and\r\nto the enemies all the while allowed not a moment's quiet or recess,\r\nbut was ever distressing them with sudden incursions and ravages. Then,\r\nhaving sufficiently alarmed and terrified them, his next course was to\r\nspare them, thus to tempt them with the sweetness and allurements of\r\npeace. By this conduct, several communities which till that day had\r\nasserted a state of equality and independence, came to lay down all\r\nhostility, gave hostages, and were begirt with garrisons and fortresses,\r\nerected with such just contrivance and care, that no part of Britain\r\nhitherto known escaped thenceforward from being annoyed by them.\r\n\r\nThe following winter was employed in measures extremely advantageous\r\nand salutary. For, to the end that these people, thus wild and dispersed\r\nover the country, and thence easily instigated to war, might by a taste\r\nof pleasures be reconciled to inactivity and repose, he first privately\r\nexhorted them, then publicly assisted them, to build temples, houses and\r\nplaces of assembling. Upon such as were willing and assiduous in these\r\npursuits he heaped commendations, and reproofs upon the lifeless and\r\nslow. So that a competition for this distinction and honour, had all the\r\nforce of necessity. He was already taking care to have the sons of\r\ntheir chiefs taught the liberal sciences, already preferring the natural\r\ncapacity of the Britons to the studied acquirements of the Gauls; and\r\nsuch was his success, that they who had so lately scorned to learn\r\nthe Roman language, were become fond of acquiring the Roman eloquence.\r\nThence they began to honour our apparel, and the use of the Roman gown\r\ngrew frequent amongst them. [Footnote: \"Inde etiam habitus nostri honor,\r\net frequens toga.\"] By degrees they proceeded to the incitements and\r\ncharms of vice and dissoluteness, to magnificent galleries, sumptuous\r\nbagnios, and all the stimulations and elegance of banqueting. Nay, all\r\nthis innovation was by the unexperienced styled politeness and humanity,\r\nwhen it was indeed part of their bondage.\r\n\r\nA.D. 80. During the third year of his command, in pursuit of his\r\nconquests he discovered new people, by continuing his devastations\r\nthrough the several nations quite to the mouth of the Tay: so the frith\r\nis called. Whence such terror seized the foe, that they durst not attack\r\nour army though sorely shaken and annoyed by terrible tempests: nay,\r\nthe Romans had even time to secure possession by erecting forts. It was\r\nobserved of Agricola by men of experience, that never had any captain\r\nmore sagely chosen his stations for commodiousness and situation; for\r\nthat no place of strength founded by him, was ever taken by violence,\r\nor abandoned upon articles or despair. From these their strongholds\r\nfrequent excursions were made; for, against any long siege they were\r\nsupplied with provisions for a year. Thus they passed the winter there\r\nwithout all apprehension: every single fort defended itself. So that\r\nin all their attempts upon them the enemies were baffled, and thence\r\nreduced to utter despair; for that they could not, as formerly they were\r\nwont, repair their losses in the summer by their success in the winter;\r\nsince now whether it were winter or summer, they were equally defeated.\r\nNeither did Agricola ever arrogate to himself the glory of exploits\r\nperformed by others: were he a Centurion or were he Commander of a\r\nlegion, in the General he was sure to find a sincere witness of\r\nhis achievements. By some he is said to have been over sharp in his\r\nreproofs, since he was one who, as to them that were good he abounded in\r\ncourtesy, appeared withal stern and unpleasant to the bad. But from his\r\nanger no spleen remained. In him you had no dark reserves, no boding\r\nsilence to fear. More honourable he thought it to give open offence than\r\nto foster secret hate.\r\n\r\nA.D. 81. The fourth summer was employed in settling and securing what\r\nterritories he had overrun: indeed would the bravery of the armies and\r\nthe glory of the Roman name, have suffered it, there had been then\r\nfound in Britain itself a boundary to our conquests there. For, into the\r\nrivers Glota and Bodotria [Footnote: The Clyde and Forth.] the tide from\r\neach opposite sea flows so vastly far up the country, that their heads\r\nare parted only by a narrow neck of land, which was now secured with\r\ngarrisons. Thus of all on this side we were already masters; since the\r\nenemy were driven as it were into another island.\r\n\r\nA.D. 82. In the fifth year of the war, Agricola passing the Frith,\r\nhimself in the first ship that landed, in many and successful encounters\r\nsubdued nations till that time unknown, and placed forces in that part\r\nof Britain which fronts Ireland, more from future views than from any\r\npresent fear. In truth Ireland, as it lies just between Britain and\r\nSpain, and is capable of an easy communication with the coast of Gaul,\r\nwould have proved of infinite use in linking together these powerful\r\nlimbs of the Empire. In size it is inferior to Britain, but surpasses\r\nthe islands in our sea. In soil and climate, as also in the temper and\r\nmanners of the natives, it varies little from Britain. Its ports\r\nand landings are better known, through the frequency of commerce and\r\nmerchants. A petty King of the country, expelled by domestic dissension,\r\nwas already received into protection by Agricola, and under the\r\nappearance of friendship, reserved for a proper occasion. By him I have\r\noften heard it declared, that with a single legion and a few auxiliaries\r\nIreland might be conquered and preserved; nay, that such an acquisition\r\nwere of moment for the securing of Britain, if, on all sides the Roman\r\narms were seen, and all national liberty banished as it were out of\r\nsight.\r\n\r\nA.D. 83. For the rest; on the summer which began the sixth year of his\r\nadministration, as it was apprehended, that the nations forward would\r\nuniversally take arms, and that the ways were all infested with\r\nthe enemy's host, his first step was to coast and explore the large\r\ncommunities beyond Bodotria [Footnote: The Forth.] by the means of\r\nhis fleet, which was from the beginning employed by him as part of his\r\nforces, and in attending him at this time made a glorious appearance,\r\nwhen thus by sea and land the war was urged. In truth, the same camp\r\noften contained the foot and the horse and the marines, all intermixed,\r\nand rejoicing in common, severally magnifying their own feats, their\r\nown hazards and adventures: here were displayed the horrors of steep\r\nmountains and dismal forests; there the outrages of waves and tempests.\r\nThese boasted their exploits by land and against the foe: those the\r\nvanquished ocean; all vying together according to the usual vaunts and\r\nostentation of soldiers. Upon the Britons also, as from the captives was\r\nlearned, the sight of the fleet brought much consternation and dismay;\r\nas if, now that their solitary ocean and recesses of the deep were\r\ndisclosed and invaded, the last refuge of the vanquished was cut off. To\r\naction and arms, the several people inhabiting Caledonia had immediate\r\nrecourse, and advanced with great parade, made still greater by common\r\nrumour (as usual in things that are unknown), for that they daringly\r\nassailed our forts, and by thus insulting and defying us, created much\r\nfear and alarm. Nay, there were some who covering real cowardice under\r\nthe guise of prudence and counsel, exhorted a return to the nether side\r\nof Bodotria, [Footnote: To retreat south of the Forth.] for that it\r\nwere more eligible to retire back than to be driven. He was apprised the\r\nwhile, that the enemy meant to attack him in divers bands: so that, as\r\nthey surpassed him in numbers and in the knowledge of the country, he\r\ntoo divided his army into three parts, and thus marched, to prevent\r\ntheir surrounding him.\r\n\r\nAs soon as this disposition of his was known to the enemy, they suddenly\r\nchanged theirs, and all in a body proceeded to fall upon the ninth\r\nlegion as the least sufficient and weakest of all; and, as the assault\r\nwas in the night they slew the guards and entered the trenches, aided\r\nby the general sleep or general dismay there. They were already pursuing\r\nthe fight in the camp itself, when Agricola having from his spies learnt\r\nwhat route the enemy had taken, and closely following their track,\r\ncommanded the lightest of his foot and cavalry to charge them, whilst\r\nyet engaged, in the rear, and the whole army presently after to give a\r\nmighty shout. Moreover at break of day, the Roman banners were beheld\r\nrefulgent. Thus were the Britons dismayed with double peril and\r\ndistress; and to the Romans their courage returned. Hence seeing their\r\nlives secure, they now maintained the conflict for glory. They even\r\nreturned the attack upon the enemy: insomuch that in the very gates of\r\nthe camp a bloody encounter ensued, till the enemy were quite routed;\r\nfor both these our armies exerted their might, the one contending to\r\nshow that they had brought relief, the other to appear not to have\r\nwanted assistance. Indeed, had not the woods and marshes served for\r\nshelter to the fugitives, by this victory the war had been determined.\r\n\r\nBy this success, with such valour gained, and followed with such renown,\r\nthe army was become elated and resolute. With fierce din they cried,\r\n\"That to their bravery nothing could prove insurmountable. They must\r\npenetrate into the heart of Caledonia, and advance in a continual\r\nsuccession of battles, till they had at last found the utmost limits of\r\nBritain.\" Thus it was that they, who a little before had been so wary\r\nand so wise, were now, after the event was determined, grown full of\r\nboasts and intrepidity. Such is the lot of warfare, very unequal and\r\nunjust: in success all men assume part: the disasters are all imputed\r\nto one. Now the Britons, conjecturing the victory to proceed not from\r\nsuperior courage, but from circumstances improved and the address of\r\nour General, lost nothing of their spirit and defiance, but armed their\r\nyoung men, removed their wives and children into places of security, and\r\nin general conventions of their several communities engaged them in a\r\nleague ratified by solemn sacrifices. And thus they mutually retired for\r\nthe winter, with minds on both sides abundantly irritated.\r\n\r\nDuring the same summer, a cohort of Usipians levied in Germany and\r\nthence transported to Britain, adventured upon a feat very desperate and\r\nmemorable. When they had slain the Centurion and soldiers placed amongst\r\nthem for training them in discipline, and to serve them for patterns\r\nand directors, they embarked in three pinnaces, forcing the pilots to\r\nconduct them; and since one of these forsook them and fled away, they\r\nsuspected and therefore killed the other two. As the attempt was not\r\nyet divulged, their launching into the deep was beheld as a wonder. Anon\r\nthey were tossed hither and thither at the mercy of the waves: and, as\r\nthey often engaged for spoil with several of the Britons, obliging\r\nthem to defend their property thus invaded, in which conflicts they\r\nfrequently proved victorious, and were sometimes defeated, they were\r\nat last reduced to want so pressing, as to feed upon one another, first\r\nupon the weakest, then upon whomsoever the lot fell. In this manner were\r\nthey carried round about Britain, and having lost their vessels through\r\nignorance how to manage them, they were accounted robbers and pirates,\r\nand fell into the hands first of the Suevians, afterwards of the\r\nFrisians. Nay, as they were bought and sold for slaves, some of them,\r\nthrough change of masters, were brought over to our side of the Rhine,\r\nand grew famous from the discovery of an adventure so extraordinary.\r\n\r\nA.D. 84. In the beginning of the summer, Agricola suffered a sore blow\r\nin his family, by losing his son born about a year before. A misfortune\r\nwhich he neither bore with an ostentation of firmness and unconcern,\r\nlike many other men of magnanimity, nor with lamentations and tears\r\nworthy only of women. Besides that for this affliction, war proved one\r\nof his remedies. When therefore he had sent forward the navy, which by\r\ncommitting devastations in several places, would not fail to spread a\r\nmighty and perplexing terror, he put himself at the head of his army\r\nlightly equipped, and to it had added some of the bravest Britons, such\r\nas had been well proved through a long course of peace. Thus he arrived\r\nat the Grampian Hills, upon which the enemy were already encamped. For,\r\nthe Britons, nothing daunted by the issue of the former battle, and\r\nboldly waiting either to take vengeance or to suffer bondage, taught\r\nwithal at last, that a general union was the best way to repel common\r\ndanger, had by embassies and confederacies drawn together the forces of\r\nall their communities. Even then were to be seen thirty thousand men in\r\narms, and their youth from every quarter were still continuing to flock\r\nin, as were also such of their elderly men as were yet vigorous and\r\nhale, they who were signal in war, and now carried with them their\r\nseveral ensigns of honour formerly gained in the field. And now\r\nGalgacus, he who amongst their several leaders surpassed all in valour\r\nand descent, is said to have spoke in this strain to the multitude all\r\nvery pressing for battle,\r\n\r\n\"Whenever I contemplate the causes of the war, and the necessity to\r\nwhich we are reduced, great is my confidence that this day and this\r\nunion of yours will prove the beginning of universal liberty to Britain.\r\nFor, besides that bondage is what we have never borne, we are so beset\r\nthat beyond us there is no further land; nor in truth is there any\r\nsecurity left us from the sea whilst the Roman fleet is hovering upon\r\nour coasts. Thus the same expedient which proves honourable to brave\r\nmen, is to cowards too become the safest of all others, even present\r\nrecourse to battle and arms. The other Britons, in their past conflicts\r\nwith the Romans, whence they found various success, had still a\r\nremaining source of hope and succour in this our nation. For, of all the\r\npeople of Britain we are the noblest, and thence placed in its innermost\r\nregions, and, as we behold not so much as the coasts of such as are\r\nslaves, we thus preserve even our eyes free and unprofaned by the sight\r\nof lawless and usurped rule. To us who are the utmost inhabitants of the\r\nearth, to us the last who enjoy liberty, this extremity of the globe,\r\nthis remote tract unknown even to common fame, has to this day proved\r\nthe only protection and defence. At present the utmost boundary of\r\nBritain is laid open; and to conquer parts unknown, is thought matter of\r\ngreat pomp and boasting. Beyond us no more people are found, nor aught\r\nsave seas and rocks; and already the Romans have advanced into the heart\r\nof our country. Against their pride and domineering you will find it\r\nin vain to seek a remedy or refuge from any obsequiousness or humble\r\nbehaviour of yours. Plunderers of the earth these, who in their\r\nuniversal devastations finding countries to fail them, investigate and\r\nrob even the sea. If the enemy be wealthy, he inflames their avarice;\r\nif poor, their ambition. They are general spoilers, such as neither the\r\neastern world nor the western can satiate. They only of all men thirst\r\nafter acquisitions both poor and rich, with equal avidity and passion.\r\nTo spoil, to butcher, and to commit every kind of violence, they style\r\nby a lying name, _Government_; and when they have spread a general\r\ndesolation, they call it _Peace_. [Footnote: \"Ubi solitudinem faciunt,\r\npacem appellant.\"]\r\n\r\n\"Dearest to every man are his children and kindred, by the contrivance\r\nand designation of nature. These are snatched from us for recruits, and\r\ndoomed to bondage in other parts of the earth. Our wives and sisters,\r\nhowever they escape rapes and violence as from open enemies, are\r\ndebauched under the appearance and privilege of friendship and\r\nhospitality. Our fortunes and possessions they exhaust for tribute, our\r\ngrain for their provisions. Even our bodies and limbs are extenuated\r\nand wasted, while we are doomed to the drudgery of making cuts through\r\nwoods, and drains in bogs, under continual blows and outrages. Such as\r\nare born to be slaves are but once sold, and thenceforward nourished by\r\ntheir lords. Britain is daily paying for its servitude, is daily feeding\r\nit. Moreover, as in a tribe of household slaves, he who comes last\r\nserves for sport to all his fellows; so in this ancient state of slavery\r\nto which the world is reduced, we, as the freshest slaves and thence\r\nheld the most contemptible, are now designed to destruction. For, we\r\nhave no fields to cultivate, nor mines to dig, nor ports to make; works\r\nfor which they might be tempted to spare us alive: besides that ever\r\ndistasteful to rulers is magnanimity and a daring spirit in their\r\nsubjects. Indeed our very situation, so solitary and remote, the more\r\nsecurity it affords to us, does but raise the greater jealousy in them.\r\nSeeing therefore you are thus bereft of all hopes of mercy, rouse now at\r\nlast all your courage, both you to whom life is dearest, and you to whom\r\nglory. The Brigantes, even under the leading of a woman, burned\r\ntheir colony, stormed their entrenchments, and, had not such success\r\ndegenerated into sloth, might have quite cast off the yoke of slavery.\r\nLet us who still preserve our forces entire, us who are still unsubdued,\r\nand want not to acquire liberty but only to secure it, manifest at once,\r\nupon the first encounter, what kind of men they are that Caledonia has\r\nreserved for her own vindication and defence.\r\n\r\n\"Do you indeed believe the Romans to be equally brave and vigorous in\r\nwar, as during peace they are vicious and dissolute? From our quarrels\r\nand divisions it is that they have derived their renown, and thus\r\nconvert the faults of their enemies to the glory of their own army;\r\nan army compounded of many nations so different, that as it is success\r\nalone which holds them together, misfortunes and disasters will surely\r\ndissolve them. Unless you suppose that the Germans there, that the\r\nGauls, and many of the Britons (whom with shame I mention), men who\r\nhowever have been all much longer their enemies than their slaves,\r\nare yet attached to them by any real fidelity and affection, whilst\r\npresenting their blood to establish a domination altogether foreign\r\nand unnatural to them all. What restrains them is no more than awe and\r\nterror, frail bonds of endearment; and when these are removed, such who\r\ncease to fear, will immediately begin to manifest their hate. Amongst us\r\nis found whatever can stimulate men to victory. The Romans have no wives\r\nto hearten and to urge them. They have here no fathers and mothers to\r\nupbraid them for flying. Many of them have no country at all, or at\r\nleast their country is elsewhere. But a few in number they are, ignorant\r\nof the region and thence struck with dread, whilst to their eyes,\r\nwhatever they behold around them, is all wild and strange, even the air\r\nand sky, with the woods and the sea; so that the Gods have in some sort\r\ndelivered them enclosed and bound into our hands.\r\n\r\n\"Be not dismayed with things of mere show, and with a glare of gold and\r\nof silver: this is what can neither wound, nor save. In the very host\r\nof the enemy we shall find bands of our own. The Britons will own and\r\nespouse their own genuine cause. The Gauls will recollect their former\r\nliberty. What the Usipians have lately done, the other Germans will do,\r\nand abandon the Romans. Thereafter nothing remains to be feared. Their\r\nforts are ungarrisoned; their colonies replenished with the aged and\r\ninfirm; and between the people and their magistrates, whilst the\r\nformer are averse to obedience, and the latter rule with injustice, the\r\nmunicipal cities are weakened and full of dissensions. Here you see a\r\ngeneral, here an army: there you may behold tributes and the mines, with\r\nall the other train of calamities and curses ever pursuing men enslaved.\r\nWhether all these are to be for ever imposed, or whether we forthwith\r\navenge ourselves for the attempt, this very field must determine. As\r\ntherefore you advance to battle, look back upon your ancestors, look\r\nforward to your posterity.\"\r\n\r\nThey received his speech joyfully, with chantings, and terrible din, and\r\nmany dissonant shouts, after the manner of barbarians. Already too their\r\nbands moved, and the glittering of their arms appeared, as all the most\r\nresolute were running to the front: moreover the army was forming\r\nin battle array; when Agricola; who indeed saw his soldiers full of\r\nalacrity, and hardly to be restrained even by express cautions, yet\r\nchose to discourse to them in the following strain. \"It is now the\r\neighth year, my fellow-soldiers, since through the virtue and auspicious\r\nfortune of the Roman Empire, and by your own services and fidelity you\r\nhave been pursuing the conquest of Britain. In so many expeditions that\r\nyou have undertaken, in so many battles as you have fought, you have\r\nstill had constant occasion either to be exerting your bravery against\r\nthe foe, or your patience and pains even against the obstacles of\r\nnature. Neither, during all these struggles, have we found any cause\r\nof mutual regret, I to have conducted such soldiers, or you to have\r\nfollowed such a captain. We have both passed the limits which we found,\r\nI those known to the ancient governors, you those of former armies; and\r\nwe possess the very extremity of Britain, not only in the bruitings of\r\nfame and vulgar rumour, but possess it with our camps and arms. Britain\r\nis entirely discovered, and entirely subdued. In truth, as the army has\r\nbeen marching, whilst in passing morasses and mountains and rivers\r\nyou have been fatigued and distressed, I was wont to hear every man\r\nremarkably brave ask, _When shall we see the enemy, when be led to\r\nbattle?_ Already they are come, roused from their fastnesses and lurking\r\nholes. Here you see the end of all your wishes, here scope for all your\r\nvalour, and all things promising and propitious, if you conquer; but\r\nall cross and disastrous, should you be vanquished. For, as to have\r\nthus marched over a tract of country so immense, to have passed through\r\ngloomy forests, to have crossed arms of the deep, is matter of glory and\r\napplause whilst we advance against the enemy; so if we fly before them,\r\nwhatever is now most in our favour, will then prove most to our peril.\r\nWe know not the situation of the country so well as they know it; we\r\nhave not provisions so abundant as they have: but we have limbs and\r\narms; and in these, all things. For myself; it is a rule long since\r\nsettled by me, that safety there is none either to the army or to the\r\ngeneral, in turning their backs upon the foe. Hence it is not only more\r\neligible to lose life honourably than to save it basely, but security\r\nand renown both arise from the same source. Neither would it be a fate\r\nvoid of glory to fall in this the utmost verge of earth and of nature.\r\n\r\n\"Were the people now arrayed against you such as were new to you, were\r\nyou to engage with bands never before tried, I should animate you by the\r\nexamples of other armies. At present, only recollect and enumerate your\r\nown signal exploits, only ask and consult your own eyes. These are they\r\nwhom but the last year you utterly discomfited, only by the terror of\r\nyour shouting, when, trusting to the darkness of the night, they by\r\nstealth attacked a single legion. These are they who of all the Britons\r\nare the most abandoned to fear and flight, and thence happen thus long\r\nto survive all the rest. It is with us as with those who make inroads\r\ninto woods and forests. As beasts of the greatest strength there, are\r\ndriven thence by the superior force of such as pursue them, and as the\r\ntimorous and spiritless fly even at the cry of the pursuers: in like\r\nmanner, all the bravest Britons are long since fallen by the sword.\r\nThey that remain are only a crowd, fearful and effeminate: nor can you\r\nconsider them as men whom you have therefore reached, because they have\r\npersisted to oppose you, but as such whom you have surprised as the last\r\nand forlorn of all, who struck with dread and bereft of spirit, stand\r\nbenumbed in yonder field, whence you may gain over them a glorious and\r\nmemorable victory. Here complete all your expeditions and efforts: here\r\nclose a struggle of fifty years with one great and important day, so\r\nthat to the army may not be imputed either the procrastination of the\r\nwar, or any cause for reviving it.\"\r\n\r\nApparent, even whilst Agricola spoke, was the ardour of the soldiers,\r\nmighty their transport and applause at the end of his speech, and\r\ninstantly they flew to their arms. Thus inflamed and urging to engage,\r\nhe formed them so that the strong band of auxiliary foot, who were eight\r\nthousand men, composed the centre. The wings were environed with three\r\nthousand horse. The legions without advancing stood embattled just\r\nwithout the entrenchment; for that mighty would be the glory of the\r\nvictory, were it, by sparing them, gained without spilling any Roman\r\nblood; and they were still a sure stay and succour, should the rest be\r\nrepulsed. The British host was ranged upon the rising grounds, at once\r\nfor show and terror, in such sort that the first band stood upon the\r\nplain, and the rest rose successively upon the brows of the hills, one\r\nrank close above another, as if they had been linked together. Their\r\ncavalry and chariots of war filled the interjacent field with great\r\ntumult and boundings to and fro. Agricola then, fearing from the\r\nsurpassing multitude of the enemy, that he might be beset at once in\r\nthe front and on each flank, opened and extended his host. Yet, though\r\nthence his ranks must prove more relaxed, and many advised him to bring\r\non the legions, he, who rather entertained a spirit of hope, and in all\r\ndifficulties was ever firm, dismissed his horse and advanced on foot\r\nbefore the banners.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the onset the conflict was maintained at a distance.\r\nThe Britons, they who were possessed at once of bravery and skill, armed\r\nwith their huge swords and small bucklers, quite eluded our missive\r\nweapons, or beat them quite off, whilst of their own they poured a\r\ntorrent upon us, till Agricola encouraged three Batavian cohorts and\r\ntwo of the Tungrians, to close with the enemy and bring them to an\r\nengagement hand to hand; as what was with those veteran soldiers a\r\nlong practice, and become familiar, but to the enemy very uneasy and\r\nembarrassing, as they were armed with very little targets and with\r\nswords of enormous size. For, the swords of the Britons, which are blunt\r\nat the end, are unfit for grapling and cannot support a close encounter.\r\nHence the Batavians thickened their blows, wounded them with the iron\r\nbosses of their bucklers, mangled their faces, and, bearing down all who\r\nwithstood them upon the plain, were already carrying the attack up to\r\nthe hills: insomuch that the rest of the cohorts, incited by emulation\r\nand sudden ardour, joined with those and made havoc of all whom they\r\nencountered. Nay, such was the impetuosity and hurry of the victory,\r\nthat many were left behind but half dead, others not so much as wounded.\r\nIn the meantime their troops of cavalry took to flight: the chariots of\r\nwar mingled with the battalions of foot; and though they had so lately\r\nstruck terror, were now themselves beset and entangled with our thick\r\nbands, as also with the unevenness and intricacy of the place. Of\r\na combat of cavalry this bore not the least appearance: since here,\r\nstanding obstinately foot to foot, they pressed to overthrow each other\r\nby the weight and bodies of their horses. Moreover the war-chariots, now\r\nabandoned and straggling, as also the horses destitute of managers and\r\nthence wild and affrighted, were running hither and thither just as the\r\nnext fright drove them; insomuch that all of their own side, who met\r\nthem or crossed their way, were beaten down by them.\r\n\r\nNow those of the Britons who were lodged upon the ridges of the hills\r\nand had hitherto no share in the encounter, like men yet pressed by no\r\nperil looked with scorn upon our forces as but few in number, and began\r\nto descend softly and to surround them in the rear, whilst they were\r\nurging their victory. But Agricola, who had apprehended this very\r\ndesign, despatched to engage them four squadrons of horse, such as he\r\nhad reserved near him for the sudden exigencies of the field; and by\r\nthis providence of his, the more furiously they had advanced, the more\r\nkeenly were they repulsed and utterly routed. Thus against the Britons\r\nthemselves their own devices were turned; and by the order of the\r\nGeneral, the squadrons of cavalry which charged in front, wheeled about\r\nand assailed the enemy behind. Then in truth, all over the open fields\r\nwas to be seen a spectacle prodigious and tragical, incessant pursuits,\r\nwounds and captivity, and the present captives always slaughtered, as\r\noften as others occurred to be taken. Now the enemy behaved just as they\r\nhappened to be prompted by their several humours. Sometimes they fled in\r\nlarge troops with all their arms, before a smaller number that pursued\r\nthem: others, quite unarmed, rushed into peril, and desperately\r\npresented themselves to instant death. On all sides lay scattered arms\r\nand carcasses, and mangled limbs, and the ground was dyed with blood.\r\nNay, now and then even by the vanquished was exerted notable wrath and\r\nbravery. When once they drew near the woods, they rejoined and rallied,\r\nand thus circumvented the foremost pursuers, such as, without knowing\r\nthe country, had rashly ventured too far. Whence we must have suffered\r\nsome notable disaster, from such confidence void of caution, had\r\nnot Agricola who was assiduously visiting every quarter, ordered the\r\nstoutest cohorts lightly equipped to range themselves in the form of\r\na toil [Footnote: A net or web, to encompass them; such as Herodotus\r\ndescribes, for clearing out a vanquished enemy.] to invest them, also\r\nsome of the cavalry to dismount, and enter the strait passes, and the\r\nrest of the horse, at the same time, to beat the more open and passable\r\nparts of the woods. Now, as soon as they perceived our forces to\r\ncontinue the pursuit with ranks regular and close, they betook\r\nthemselves to open flight, in no united bands as before, no one man\r\nregarding or awaiting another; but quite scattered, and each shunning\r\nany companion, they all made to places far remote and desert. What ended\r\nthe pursuit was night and a satiety of slaughter. Of the enemy were\r\nslain ten thousand. There fell of our men three hundred and forty,\r\namongst these Aulus Atticus, commander of a cohort; one by his own\r\nyouthful heart, as also by a fiery horse, hurried into the midst of the\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed a night of great joy to the conquerors, both from victory\r\nand spoil. The Britons, who wandered in despair, men and women uttering\r\nin concert their dismal wailings, dragged along their wounded, called to\r\nsuch as were unhurt, deserted their houses, nay, in rage even set them\r\non fire; made choice of lurking holes, then instantly forsook them; then\r\nmet to consult, and from their counsels gathered some hope: sometimes,\r\nupon beholding their dearest pledges of nature, their spirits became\r\nutterly sunk and dejected; sometimes, by the same sight, they were\r\nroused into resolution and fury. Nay, 'tis very certain, that some\r\nmurdered their children and wives, as an act of compassion and\r\ntenderness. The next day produced a more ample display of the victory;\r\non all sides a profound silence, solitary hills, thick smoke rising from\r\nthe houses on fire, and not a living soul to be found by the scouts.\r\nWhen from these, who had been despatched out every way, it was learnt,\r\nthat whither the enemy had fled no certain traces could be discovered,\r\nand that they had nowhere rallied in bodies; when the summer was\r\nlikewise passed and thence an impossibility of extending the operations\r\nof war, he conducted his army into the borders of the Horestians. After\r\nhe had there received hostages, he ordered the Admiral of the Fleet to\r\nsail round Britain. For this expedition he was furnished with proper\r\nforces, and before him was already gone forth the terror of the Roman\r\npower: he himself the while led on his foot and horse with a slow pace,\r\nthat thus the minds of these new nations might be awed and dismayed\r\neven by prolonging his march through them: he then lodged his army in\r\ngarrisons for the winter. The fleet too having found a favourable sea,\r\nentered with great fame, into the harbour of Rhutupium: [Footnote:\r\nSupposed to be Sandwich Haven.] for, from thence it had sailed, and\r\ncoasting along the nethermost shore of Britain, thither returned.\r\n\r\nWith this course and situation of things Agricola by letters acquainted\r\nthe Emperor; tidings which, however modestly recounted, without all\r\nostentation, or any pomp of words, Domitian received as with joy in his\r\ncountenance, so with anguish in his soul: such was his custom. His heart\r\nindeed smote him for his late mock triumph over the Germans, which he\r\nknew to be held in public derision; as to adorn it he had purchased a\r\nnumber of slaves, who were so decked in their habits and hair, as to\r\nresemble captives in war. But here a victory mighty and certain, gained\r\nby the slaughter of so many thousands of the enemy, was universally\r\nsounded by the voice of fame, and received with vast applause. Terrible\r\nabove all things it was to him, that the name of a private man should be\r\nexalted above that of the Prince. In vain had he driven from the public\r\ntribunals all pursuits of popular evidence and fame, in vain smothered\r\nthe lustre of every civil accomplishment, if any other than himself\r\npossessed the glory of excelling in war: nay, however he might dissemble\r\nevery other distaste, yet to the person of the Emperor properly\r\nappertained the virtue and praise of being a great General. Tortured\r\nwith these anxious thoughts, and indulging his humour of being shut up\r\nin secret, a certain indication that he was fostering some sanguinary\r\npurpose, he at last judged it the best course, upon this occasion, to\r\nhide and reserve his rancour till the first flights of fame were\r\npassed, and the affection of the army cooled. For, Agricola held yet the\r\nadministration of Britain.\r\n\r\nTo him therefore he caused to be decreed in Senate the triumphal\r\nornaments, a statue crowned with laurel, with whatever else is bestowed\r\ninstead of a real triumph, and heightened this his compliment with many\r\nexpressions full of esteem and honour. He directed moreover a general\r\nexpectation to be raised, that to Agricola was destined the Province of\r\nSyria, a Government then vacant by the death of Atilius Rufus, a man\r\nof Consular quality, since the same was reserved only for men of\r\nillustrious rank. Many there were who believed, that an Imperial\r\nfreedman, one much trusted with the secret designs of his master, was by\r\nhim despatched to carry the instrument appointing Agricola Governor of\r\nSyria, with orders to deliver it to him, were he still in Britain;\r\nthat the freedman met Agricola crossing the Channel, and without once\r\nspeaking to him, returned directly to Domitian. It is uncertain whether\r\nthis account be true, or only a fiction framed in conformity to the\r\ncharacter and genius of the Prince. To his successor, in the meantime,\r\nAgricola had surrendered the Province now settled in perfect peace and\r\nsecurity. Moreover, to prevent all remarks upon the manner of his entry\r\ninto Rome, from any popular distinction paid him, and any concourse of\r\npeople to meet him, he utterly declined this observance of his friends,\r\nand came into the city by night; and by night, as he was directed,\r\nwent to the palace. He was there received by the Emperor, with a short\r\nembrace, but without a word said; then passed, undistinguished, amongst\r\nthe crowd of servile courtiers. Now in order to soften with other\r\nand different virtues the reputation of a military man, a name ever\r\ndistasteful to those who live themselves in idleness, he resigned\r\nhimself entirely to indolence and repose. In his dress he was modest;\r\nin his conversation courteous and free, and never found accompanied with\r\nmore than one or two of his friends. Insomuch that many, such especially\r\nas are wont to judge of great men by their retinue and parade, all\r\ncalculated to gain popular admiration, when they had beheld and observed\r\nAgricola, sought to know whence proceeded his mighty fame: there were\r\nindeed but few who could account for the motives of his conduct.\r\n\r\nFrequently, during the course of that time, was he accused in his\r\nabsence before Domitian, and in his absence also acquitted. What\r\nthreatened his life was no crime of his, nor complaint of any particular\r\nfor injuries received, nor aught else save the glorious character of\r\nthe man, and the spirit of the Emperor hating all excellence and every\r\nvirtue. With these causes there concurred the most mischievous sort of\r\nall enemies, they who extolled him in order to destroy him. Moreover in\r\nthe Commonwealth there ensued such times as would not permit the name\r\nof Agricola to remain unmentioned: so many were the armies which we had\r\nlost in Moesia, in Dacia, in Germany, in Pannonia; all by the wretched\r\nconduct of our Generals, either altogether impotent or foolhardy:\r\nso many withal were the brave officers, with so many bands of men\r\noverthrown and taken. Neither was the question and contest now about\r\nmaintaining the limits of the Empire and guarding the rivers which\r\nserved for its boundaries, but about defending the standing encampments\r\nof the legions and preserving our own territories. Thus, when public\r\nmisfortunes were following one another in a continual train, when every\r\nyear was become signal for calamities and slaughters, Agricola was by\r\nthe common voice of the populace required for the command of our armies.\r\nFor, all men were comparing his vigour, his firmness, and his mind\r\ntrained in war, with the sloth and timidity of the others. With\r\ndiscourses of this strain, it is certain that even the ears of Domitian\r\nhimself were teased; whilst all the best of his freedmen advised and\r\npressed him to this choice, out of pure affection and duty, as did the\r\nworst out of virulence and envy; and to whatever appeared most malignant\r\nthat Prince was ever prone. In this manner was Agricola, as well through\r\nhis own virtues as through the base management of others, pushed upon a\r\nprecipice even of glory.\r\n\r\nA.D. 90. The year was now arrived when to the lot of Agricola was to\r\nfall the Proconsulship of Asia or of Africa: and, as Civica had been\r\nlately murdered (even whilst Proconsul of the former Province), Agricola\r\nwas neither unprepared what course to pursue, nor Domitian unfurnished\r\nwith an example to follow. It happened too, that certain persons, men\r\napprised of the secret purposes of the Prince, made it their business\r\nto accost Agricola and ask him, whether he meant in earnest to take\r\npossession of his Province. Nay, they began, at first indeed with some\r\nreserve, to extol a life of tranquillity and repose; anon they proffered\r\ntheir good offices to procure his demission and excuse: at last,\r\nthrowing off all disguise, and proceeding at once to dissuade and to\r\nintimidate him, they prevailed with him to be carried, with this as his\r\nsuit, to Domitian. He, already prepared to dissemble his sentiments,\r\nand assuming a mien of haughtiness, not only received the petition of\r\nAgricola to be excused, but when he had granted it, suffered himself\r\nto be presented with formal thanks, Nor was he ashamed of conferring\r\na grace so unpopular and odious. To Agricola however he gave not the\r\nsalary which was wont to be paid to Proconsuls, and which he himself had\r\ncontinued to some. Whether he were affronted that it was not asked, or\r\nwhether restrained by his own guilty mind, lest he might seem to have\r\npurchased with money what he had hindered by his interposition and\r\npower. It is the nature of men, that whomsoever they injure they hate.\r\nNow Domitian was in his temper apt to be suddenly transported into\r\nrage, and, in proportion as he smothered his vengeance, the more\r\nirreconcilable he always certainly proved. Yet by the prudence and\r\nmoderation of Agricola, he was softened. For, by no contumacy of his,\r\nnor by any vain ostentation of a spirit of liberty ill-timed, did he\r\ncourt fame or urge his fate. Let such who are wont to admire things\r\ndaring and forbidden, know, that even under evil Princes great men may\r\nbe produced, and that by the means of modesty and observance, provided\r\nthese be accompanied with application and vigour, they may rise to an\r\nequal measure of public estimation and praise with that of many, who\r\nthrough a conduct very stubborn and precipitate, but of no advantage to\r\nthe Commonweal, have distinguished themselves by dying only to gain a\r\ngreat name.\r\n\r\nA.D. 93. Afflicting to us his family proved the end of his life,\r\nsorrowful to his friends; and even to foreigners and such as knew him\r\nnot, matter of trouble and condolence. The commonalty likewise, and\r\nsuch people as were void of employment, [Footnote: Or it may be thus\r\ntranslated: \"The body of the people though chiefly intent upon such\r\naffairs as concerned not the State.\"--GORDON. Burnouf is better: \"Ce\r\npeuple, qu'occupent d'autres intérêts.\"] were not only frequent in\r\ntheir visits to his house, but in all public places, in all particular\r\ncompanies made him the subject of their conversation. Nor, when his\r\ndeath was divulged, was there a soul found who either rejoiced at it,\r\nor presently forgot it. What heightened the public commiseration and\r\nconcern, was a prevailing rumour that he was despatched by poison.\r\nThat there was any proof of this, I dare not aver. Yet it is true, that\r\nduring the whole course of his illness, Domitian caused frequent visits\r\nto be made him, indeed much more frequent than Princes are wont to\r\nmake, both by his favourite freedmen and most trusty physicians;\r\nwhether through real concern for his health, or solicitude to learn the\r\nprobability of his death. It is well known that on the day in which he\r\nexpired, continual accounts were, by messengers purposely placed, every\r\ninstant transmitted to the Emperor, how fast his end was approaching;\r\nand no one believed, that he would thus quicken such tidings, had he\r\nbeen to feel any sorrow from hearing them. In his face however and even\r\nin his spirit, he affected to show some guise of grief; for, he was now\r\nsecure against the object of his hate, and could more easily dissemble\r\nhis present joy, than lately his fear. It was abundantly notorious how\r\nmuch it rejoiced him, upon reading the last will of Agricola, to find\r\nhimself left joint heir with his excellent wife and tender daughter.\r\nThis he took to have been done out of judgment and choice, and in\r\npure honour to himself. So blind and corrupt was his mind rendered by\r\ncontinual flattery, as not to know, that to no Prince but a bad one will\r\nany good father bequeath his fortune.\r\n\r\nAgricola was born on the 13th of June, during the third Consulship\r\nof the Emperor Caligula. He died on the 24th of August, during the\r\nConsulship of Collega and Priscus, in the fifty-sixth year of his age.\r\nIf posterity be desirous to know his make and stature; in his person\r\nhe was rather genteel and regular than tall. [Footnote: Decentior quam\r\nsublimior fuit.] In his aspect there was nothing terrible. His looks\r\nwere extremely graceful and pleasing. A good man you would have readily\r\nbelieved him, and been glad to have found that he was a great man. Nay,\r\nthough he was snatched away whilst his age was yet in full vigour,\r\nif however his life be measured by his glory, he attained to a mighty\r\nlength of days. For, every true felicity and acquisition, namely, all\r\nsuch as arise from virtue, he had already enjoyed to the full. As he had\r\nbeen likewise dignified with the Consular and triumphal honours, what\r\nmore could fortune add to his lustre and renown? After enormous wealth\r\nhe sought not: an honourable share he possessed. As behind him he left\r\nsurviving his daughter and his wife, he may be even accounted happy;\r\nsince by dying whilst his credit was nowise impaired, his fame in its\r\nfull splendour, his relations and friends yet in a state of security, he\r\nescaped the evils to come. For, as before us he was wont to express his\r\nwishes, that he might survive to see this truly blessed Age, and Trajan\r\nswaying the sovereignty, wishes which he uttered with presages as of\r\nwhat would surely ensue; so it was a wondrous consolation attending the\r\nquickness of his death, that thence he evaded the misery of the latter\r\ntimes, when Domitian, who had ceased to exert his tyranny by starts only\r\nand intermissions, was come now to rend the Commonwealth by cruelties\r\nwithout all respite, and to overthrow it as it were by one great and\r\ndeadly stroke.\r\n\r\nFor, Agricola saw not the Court of the Senate besieged, nor the Senate\r\nenclosed by armed men, nor the butchery of so many men of Consular\r\ndignity, nor the flight and exile of so many ladies of the prime\r\nnobility, all effected in one continued havoc. Till then Carus Metius,\r\nthe accuser, was only considerable for having been victorious in one\r\nbloody process; till then the cruel motions of Messallinus rang only\r\nwithin the palace at Alba; [Footnote: A country palace of Domitian.] and\r\nin those days Massa Bebius (afterwards so exercised in arraigning the\r\ninnocent) was himself arraigned as a criminal. Presently after we, with\r\nour own hands, dragged Helvidius to prison and execution: we beheld the\r\nmelancholy doom of Mauricus and Rusticus: we found ourselves besprinkled\r\nwith the innocent blood of Senecio. Even Nero withheld his eyes from\r\nscenes of cruelty, he indeed ordered murders to be perpetrated, but saw\r\nnot the perpetration. The principal part of our miseries under Domitian,\r\nwas to be obliged to see him and be seen by him, at a time when all our\r\nsighs and sorrows were watched and marked down for condemnation; when\r\nthat cruel countenance of his, always covered with a settled red, whence\r\nhe hardened himself against all shame and blushing, served him to mark\r\nand recount all the pale horrors at once possessing so many men. Thou\r\ntherefore, Agricola, art happy, not only as thy life was glorious, but\r\nas thy death was seasonable. According to the account of such who heard\r\nthy last words, thou didst accept thy fate cheerfully and with firmness,\r\nas if thou thus didst thy part to show the Emperor to be guiltless. But\r\nto myself and thy daughter, besides the anguish of having our father\r\nsnatched from us, it proves a fresh accession of sorrow, that we had\r\nnot an opportunity to attend thee in thy sickness, to solace thy sinking\r\nspirits, to please ourselves with seeing thee, please ourselves\r\nwith embracing thee. Doubtless, we should have greedily received thy\r\ninstructions and sayings, and engraved them for ever upon our hearts.\r\nThis is our woe, this a wound to our spirit, that by the lot of long\r\nabsence from thee thou wast already lost to us for four years before thy\r\ndeath. There is no question, excellent father, but that with whatever\r\nthy condition required thou wast honourably supplied, as thou wast\r\nattended by thy wife, one so full of tenderness for her husband: yet\r\nfewer tears accompanied thy course, and during thy last moments somewhat\r\nwas wanting to satisfy thine eyes.\r\n\r\nIf for the _Manes_ of the just any place be found; if, as philosophers\r\nhold, great spirits perish not with the body, pleasing be thy repose.\r\nMoreover, recall us thy family from this our weakness in regretting\r\nthee, and from these our effeminate wailings, to the contemplation of\r\nthy virtues, for which it were unjust to lament or to mourn. Let us\r\nrather adorn thy memory with deathless praises and (as far as our\r\ninfirmities will allow) by pursuing and adopting thy excellencies.\r\nThis is true honour, this the natural duty incumbent upon every near\r\nrelation. This is also what I would recommend to thy daughter and thy\r\nwife, so to reverence the memory of a father, and a husband, as to be\r\never ruminating upon all his doings, upon all his sayings, and rather to\r\nadore his immortal name, rather the image of his mind than that of\r\nhis person. Not that I mean to condemn the use of statues, such as\r\nare framed of marble or brass. But as the persons of men are frail and\r\nperishing, so are likewise the portraitures of men. The form of the soul\r\nis eternal, such as you cannot represent and preserve by the craft of\r\nhands or by materials foreign to its nature, nor otherwise than by a\r\nsimilitude and conformity of manners. Whatever we loved in Agricola,\r\nwhatever we admired, remains, and will for ever remain implanted in the\r\nhearts of men, through an eternity of ages, and conveyed down in the\r\nvoice of fame, in the record of things. For, many of the great ancients,\r\nby being buried in oblivion, have thence reaped the fate of men\r\naltogether mean and inglorious: but Agricola shall ever survive in his\r\nhistory here composed and transmitted to posterity.",
