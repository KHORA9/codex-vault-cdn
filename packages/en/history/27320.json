The\r\ngateway with its four towers is the best example of the characteristic\r\nCambridge gate, and dates from the foundation of the College. It is\r\nbuilt of red brick (the eastern counties marble), dressed with stone.\r\nThe street front of the College to the right and left remains in its\r\noriginal state, except that after the old chapel and infirmary of the\r\nHospital of St. John (to which allusion will be made hereafter) were\r\npulled down, the north end was completed by a block of lecture rooms in\r\n1869.\r\n\r\nThe front of the gate is richly decorated with heraldic devices, full of\r\nhistorical meaning and associations. The arms are those of the\r\nfoundress; the shield, France (ancient) and England quarterly, was the\r\nroyal shield of the period; the bordure, gobonny argent and azure (the\r\nargent in the upper dexter compartment), was the \"difference\" of the\r\nBeauforts, and is only slightly indicated. The supporters, two\r\nantelopes, come from Henry VI. There is no crest above the shield, and\r\nheraldic rules are against its use by a lady, but on her seal the Lady\r\nMargaret used the Beaufort arms as above ensigned, with a coronet of\r\nroses and fleur-de-lis, out of which issues an eagle, displayed or; and\r\nthis device of coat and crest is used by the College. The arms on the\r\ngate are surrounded by badges, the Portcullis of the Beauforts, the\r\nTudor, or Union, rose, each surmounted by a crown. Besides these we have\r\ndaisies (marguerites), the badge of the Lady Margaret, and some flowers,\r\nwhich are not so easily identified. Certain vestments and embroideries,\r\nwhich belonged to the Lady Margaret, of which a list has been preserved,\r\nare described as \"garnishede with sophanyes and my ladyes poisy,\" or,\r\n\"with rede roses and syphanyes.\" The sophanye was an old English name\r\nfor the Christmas rose, and there seems little doubt that these flowers\r\non the gate are meant for Christmas roses. The carving on the right,\r\nunder the portcullis, where these emblems seem to be growing out of\r\nsomething resembling a masonic apron, is very curious.\r\n\r\nAbove the gate are two sets of rooms. The upper set has been used from\r\nthe beginning as the Treasury or Muniment Room of the College; the set\r\nimmediately above the arch is now an ordinary set of rooms. In this set\r\nresided, during his college career, Lord Thomas Howard, a son of the\r\nfourth Duke of Norfolk, afterwards himself first Earl of Suffolk and\r\nBaron Howard de Walden. He fought against the Armada in 1588, and\r\ncommanded the expedition to the Azores in 1591; the fame of Sir Richard\r\nGrenville of the _Revenge_ has somewhat eclipsed that of his leader in\r\nthe latter case; the reader may recall Tennyson's _Ballad of the Fleet_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BAG OF FLOWERS OVER ENTRANCE GATEWAY]\r\n\r\nTo the left of the gate it will be observed that five windows on the\r\nfirst floor are of larger size than the rest; this was the original\r\nposition of the Library; the books were removed in 1616 to a room over\r\nthe Kitchen, and later to the present Library. According to tradition\r\nHenry Kirke White, the poet, occupied, and died in, the rooms on the\r\nground-floor next the tower; he lies buried in the old churchyard of All\r\nSaints', across the street.\r\n\r\nEntering the gate the Hall and Kitchen face us, and preserve much of\r\ntheir original appearance. But right and left the changes have been\r\ngreat. The old Chapel was swept away in 1869--its foundations are marked\r\nout by cement; at this time the Hall was lengthened, and a second oriel\r\nwindow added. The range of buildings on the south was raised and faced\r\nwith stone about 1775, when the craze for Italianising buildings was\r\nfashionable; it was then intended to treat the rest of the Court in like\r\nmanner, but fortunately the scheme was not carried out.\r\n\r\nIf we walk along the south side of the Court we may notice on the\r\nunderside of the lintel of G staircase the words, \"Stag, Nov. 15, 1777.\"\r\nIt seems that on that date a stag, pursued by the hunt, took refuge in\r\nthe College, and on this staircase; the members of the College had just\r\nfinished dinner when the stag and his pursuers entered. On the next\r\nstaircase, F, there is a passage leading to the lane with the Kitchen\r\nOffices, this passage is sometimes known as \"The Staincoat\"; the\r\npassage leading from the Screens into the Kitchen is still sometimes\r\ncalled \"The Staincoat,\" or \"The Stankard.\" These curious names really\r\nmean the same thing. It appears that in times past a pole was kept,\r\nprobably for carrying casks of beer, but on which the undergraduates\r\nseem also to have hoisted those of their number, or even servants, who\r\nhad offended against the rules and customs of the College; this pole was\r\ncalled the Stang, and the place or passage in which it was kept the\r\nStangate Hole, with the above variations or corruptions.\r\n\r\nReserving the Chapel for the present we pass through the Screens, the\r\nentrance to the Hall being on the right, to the Kitchen on the left. We\r\nenter the Second Court. This beautiful and stately Court was built\r\nbetween 1599 and 1600 (the date 1599 may be seen on the top of one of\r\nthe water-pipes on the north side), the cost being in great part\r\nprovided by Mary, Countess of Shrewsbury, a daughter of Sir William\r\nCavendish by the celebrated Bess of Hardwick, and wife of Gilbert,\r\nseventh Earl of Shrewsbury. The original drawings for the Court, and the\r\ncontract for its construction, almost unique documents of their kind,\r\nare preserved in the Library. The whole of the first floor on the north\r\nside was at first used as a gallery for the Master's Lodge; it is now\r\nused as a Combination Room. Over the arch of the gate on the western\r\nside of the Court is a statue of the Countess, with her shield (showing\r\nthe arms of Talbot and Cavendish impaled); these were presented to the\r\nCollege by her nephew, William Cavendish, Duke of Newcastle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW FROM THE SCREENS]\r\n\r\nA pleasing view of the Court is got by standing in the south-west corner\r\nand looking towards the Chapel Tower, with an afternoon sun the\r\ncolouring and grouping of the buildings is very effective.\r\n\r\nPassing through the arch we enter the Third Court; this was built at\r\nvarious times during the seventeenth century. On the north we have the\r\nLibrary, the cost of which was chiefly provided by John Williams, a\r\nFellow of the College, successively Dean of Westminster, Bishop of\r\nLincoln, and Archbishop of York; he was also Lord Keeper of the Great\r\nSeal to James I. As originally built the Library occupied the upper\r\nfloor only, the ground-floor being fitted up as rooms for the\r\naccommodation of the Fellows and scholars, on a special foundation of\r\nBishop Williams, but this lower part is now all absorbed into the\r\nLibrary. The southern and western sides of the Court were built between\r\n1669 and 1674, some part of the cost being provided from College funds,\r\nthe rest by donations from members of the College. On the last or\r\nsouthern pier of the arcade, on the west side of the Court, there are\r\nthe two inscriptions: \"Flood, Oct. 27, 1762,\" \"Flood, Feb. 10, 1795,\"\r\nrecording what must have been highly inconvenient events at the time.\r\n\r\nThe central arch on the western side of the Court has some prominence,\r\nand was probably intended from the first as the approach to a bridge.\r\nTowards the end of the seventeenth century Sir Christopher Wren was\r\nconsulted on the subject, and a letter from him to the then Master, Dr.\r\nGower, has been preserved. Sir Christopher's proposal was a curious one:\r\nhe suggested that the course of the river Cam should be diverted and\r\ncarried in a straight line from the point where it bends near the\r\nLibrary of Trinity College. A new channel was to be dug, and a bridge\r\nbuilt over this; the water was then to be sent down the new channel, and\r\nthe old one filled up. He pointed out that this would give \"a parterre\r\nto the river, a better access to the walks, and a more beautiful\r\ndisposal of the whole ground.\" This scheme was, however, not carried\r\nout, but a stone bridge was built outside the range of the buildings on\r\nthe site of an old wooden bridge, which then gave access to the grounds.\r\nThis is the bridge which still exists; it was built, apparently from\r\nWren's designs, under the superintendence of his pupil, Nicholas\r\nHawksmoor. More than a century now passed before further building\r\noperations were undertaken. In 1825 the College employed Mr. Thomas\r\nRickman and his partner, Mr. H. Hutchinson, to prepare designs for a new\r\nCourt, with from 100 to 120 sets of rooms. This work was started in\r\n1827, and completed in 1831. The covered bridge connecting the old and\r\nnew parts of the College was designed by Mr. Hutchinson; it is popularly\r\nknown as the \"Bridge of Sighs.\" The style of this Court is Perpendicular\r\nGothic. The site was unsuited for building operations, consisting mostly\r\nof washed and peaty soil; it had been known for generations as \"the\r\nfishponds close.\" The modern concrete foundations were then unknown,\r\nand the plan adopted was to remove the peaty soil and to lay timber on\r\nthe underlying gravel. On this an enormous mass of brickwork, forming\r\nvaulted cellars, was placed; this rises above the river level, and the\r\nrooms are perfectly dry. The total cost of the building was L78,000,\r\nmost of which was provided by borrowing. The repayment, extending over a\r\nnumber of years, involved considerable self-denial on the Fellows of the\r\nCollege, their incomes being materially reduced for many years. Crossing\r\nthe covered bridge and passing down the cloisters of the New Court, we\r\nenter the grounds by the centre gate; these extend right and left, being\r\nbounded on the east by the Cam, and separated from the grounds of\r\nTrinity by a ditch.\r\n\r\nFrom the old, or Wren's, bridge over the Cam two parallel walks extend\r\nalong the front of the Court; according to tradition the broader and\r\nhigher was reserved for members of the College, the lower for College\r\nservants. At one time an avenue of trees extended from the bridge to the\r\nback gate, but the ravages of time have removed all but a few trees.\r\n\r\nAt the western end of the walk we have on the left the (private)\r\nFellows' garden, known as \"The Wilderness,\" an old-world pleasance, left\r\nas nearly as may be in a state of nature. Towards the end of the\r\neighteenth century the College employed the celebrated Mr. Lancelot\r\n(\"capability\") Brown to lay out the grounds and Wilderness. The\r\nplantation in the latter was arranged so as to form a cathedral, with\r\nnave, aisles, and transept, but here also old age and storms have\r\nbrought down many of the trees. On the right, opposite to the\r\nWilderness, there is an orchard, the subject of much legend. One popular\r\nstory is that this orchard formed the subject of a bequest to \"St.\r\nJohn's College,\" and that the testator, being an Oxford man, was held by\r\nthe Courts to have intended to benefit the College in his own\r\nUniversity. As a matter of prosaic fact, the orchard originally belonged\r\nto Merton College, Oxford, being part of the original gift of their\r\nfounder, Walter de Merton, and it was acquired by St. John's College by\r\nexchange in the early years of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe long walk terminates in a massive gate with stone pillars,\r\nsurmounted by eagles. Outside and across the road is the Eagle Close,\r\nused as the College cricket and football field.\r\n\r\nThe visitor in returning should cross the old bridge, thus getting a\r\nview of the Bridge of Sighs, and re-enter the College by the archway on\r\nthe left.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Gatehouse: St John's College]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n                       SOME INTERIORS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe visitor has been conducted through the College without pausing to\r\nenter any of the buildings. We now retrace our steps to describe these\r\nparts of the College open to inspection. It must be understood that\r\nduring a great part of the year the inspection of these interiors is\r\nsubject to the needs of a large resident Society, and as a rule it is\r\nbest to inquire at the gate for information as to the hours when these\r\nparts of the College are open.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Chapel._\r\n\r\nThe present Chapel was built between the years 1863 and 1869, from the\r\ndesigns of Sir George Gilbert Scott; it was consecrated by the Bishop of\r\nEly, 12th May 1869. As we approach it we see on the right the outline of\r\nthe old Chapel, which had served the College and the Hospital which\r\npreceded it for something like six hundred years. This former Chapel was\r\na building quite uniform and simple in appearance, filling the whole of\r\nthe north side of the Court. Originally built to serve the needs of the\r\nHospital of St. John, it was considerably altered when the College was\r\nfounded. Side Chantries were then, or shortly afterwards, added. In\r\nearly times a good deal of the life of the College centred in the\r\nChapel, in addition to its uses for worship. It was regarded as a place\r\nin which the Society was formally gathered together. In it the statutes,\r\nor rules for the government of the Society, were read at stated times,\r\nso that all might become aware of the rule under which they lived. The\r\nnames of those who had not discharged their College bills were publicly\r\nread out by the Master. The elections of the Master and of the Fellows\r\nand Scholars were held within it; of this practice the sole part that\r\nremains is the election of a Master, which by the present statutes must\r\nbe held in the Chapel. The scholastic exercises of Acts and Opponencies,\r\nin which certain doctrines were maintained and opposed, took place\r\nthere. The seal of the College was kept in the vestry, and the sealing\r\nof documents took place in the Ante-Chapel. Though documents are now\r\nsealed elsewhere, the stock of wafers for the College seal is kept by\r\nthe Chapel Clerk.\r\n\r\nThe erection of a new Chapel for the College was contemplated for about\r\n200 years before it was carried out. Dr. Gunning, who was Master from\r\n1661 to 1670, afterwards successively Bishop of Chichester and of Ely,\r\nleft by his will the sum of L300 \"to St. John's College, towards the\r\nbeginning for the building for themselves a new Chapel.\" Gunning died in\r\n1684, and in 1687 the College paid to Robert Grumbold the sum of L3 for\r\n\"a new ground plott modell of the old and new designed Chappell.\"\r\nNothing, however, came of the proposal at that time, though the idea\r\nseems always to have been before the Society.\r\n\r\nPreaching on Commemoration Day (May 6), 1861, Dr. William Selwyn, Lady\r\nMargaret Professor of Divinity, and a former Fellow, pointing out that\r\nthe College was celebrating \"its seventh jubilee,\" just 350 years having\r\npassed since the charter was granted, pleaded earnestly for the erection\r\nof a larger Chapel. The matter was taken up, and in January 1862 Sir\r\n(then Mr.) George Gilbert Scott was requested \"to advise us as to the\r\nbest plans, in his opinion, for a new Chapel.\" The scheme grew, and in\r\naddition to the Chapel it was determined by the end of that year to have\r\nalso a new Master's Lodge, and to enlarge the Dining Hall. It was then\r\nintended that the scheme should not involve a greater charge on the\r\ncorporate funds of the College than L40,000. As a matter of fact, before\r\nthe whole was carried out and paid for, the cost had risen to L97,641;\r\nof this L17,172 was provided for by donations from members of the\r\nCollege, the rest was met, partly out of capital, partly by a charge on\r\nthe College revenues, which ran for many years.\r\n\r\nThe Chapel was built on a site to the north of the old Chapel, and\r\nthrough this site ran a lane from St. John's Street to the river. An Act\r\nof Parliament had to be obtained before this lane could be closed, and\r\nthe consent of the borough was only given on condition that St. John's\r\nStreet should be widened by pulling down a row of houses on its western\r\nside, and throwing their site into the street.\r\n\r\nThe foundation-stone of the new Chapel was laid on 6th May 1864 by Mr.\r\nHenry Hoare, a member of the College, and of the well-known banking\r\nfirm. As originally designed the Chapel was to have had a slender\r\n_fleche_ instead of a tower. This had been criticised, and Mr. Scott,\r\nthe architect, designed the present tower; the additional cost being\r\nestimated at L5000. This Mr. Hoare offered to provide in yearly\r\ninstalments of L1000, but had only paid two instalments when he died\r\nfrom injuries received in a railway accident. The finial on the last\r\npinnacle of the tower was fixed on 13th December 1867 by Mr. (now Sir\r\nFrancis) Powell, M.P. for the borough of Cambridge, and a former Fellow\r\nof the College; Mr. Powell was accompanied on that occasion by Professor\r\nJohn Couch Adams and the Rev. G. F. Reyner, the Senior Bursar of the\r\nCollege.\r\n\r\nThe new Chapel was, as we have said, opened in 1869, and the old Chapel\r\nthen cleared away. The woodwork of the stalls had been transferred to\r\nthe new Chapel, but most of the internal fittings were scattered. The\r\nancient rood-screen stands in the church of Whissendine, in\r\nRutlandshire, and the old organ-case in Bilton Church, near Rugby, and\r\nother parts of the fabric were dispersed; it was perhaps inevitable. Sir\r\nGilbert Scott's idea was that the new Chapel should be of the same\r\nperiod of architecture as the old, but it is absolutely different in\r\ndesign; in the lover of things old there must always be a feeling of\r\nregret for what has gone. The mural tablets in the old Chapel were\r\nremoved to the new Ante-Chapel, the slabs in the floor were left. It is\r\nworth noting that Eleazar Knox, a Fellow of the College, and one of the\r\nsons of John Knox, the famous Scotch Reformer, was buried in the Chapel\r\nin 1591. His elder brother, Nathanael Knox, was also a Fellow. To the\r\nnorth of the old Chapel, and bordering on the lane which has been\r\nmentioned, stood the Infirmary of the Hospital which preceded the\r\nCollege. This was originally a single long room, of which the eastern\r\nend formed an oratory. In this the poor and sick, for whose benefit the\r\nHospital was founded, were received, and Mass said for them, and in\r\ntheir sight, as they lay in their beds. This Infirmary, after the\r\nfoundation of the College, was devoted to secular uses. For some time\r\nit was used as a stable and storehouse for the Master. Then later it was\r\nfitted up with floors and turned into chambers. It was approached by a\r\ntortuous passage at the eastern end of the Chapel, and was popularly\r\nknown as the Labyrinth. When the Infirmary was taken down a very\r\nbeautiful double piscina was found covered up on the walls; this is\r\npreserved in the new Chapel.\r\n\r\nThe new Chapel is built of Ancaster stone, and is in the style of\r\narchitecture known as Early Decorated, which prevailed about 1280, the\r\nprobable date of the Chapel of the Hospital. Sir Gilbert Scott very\r\nskilfully made the most of the site, and by the device of the transeptal\r\nAnte-Chapel made full use of the space at his disposal.\r\n\r\nAt the springs of the outer arch of the great door are heads of King\r\nHenry VIII. and of Queen Victoria, indicating the date of the foundation\r\nof the College and of the erection of the Chapel. On the north side of\r\nthe porch is a statue of the Lady Margaret, and on the south one of John\r\nFisher, Bishop of Rochester.\r\n\r\nThe statues on the buttresses are those of famous members of the\r\nCollege, or of its benefactors. Those facing the Court are William\r\nCecil, Lord Burghley; Lucius Carey, Viscount Falkland; John Williams,\r\nLord Keeper to James I.; Thomas Wentworth, Lord Strafford; William\r\nGilbert, author of _De Magnete_, in which the theory of the magnetism\r\nof the earth was first developed, and physician to Queen Elizabeth;\r\nRoger Ascham, and the Countess of Shrewsbury.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONUMENT OF HUGH ASHTON]\r\n\r\nWe enter the Ante-Chapel. This has a stone-vaulted roof; over the\r\ncentral bay the tower is placed. On the south wall are placed the arches\r\nfrom Bishop Fisher's Chantry in the old Chapel. The monument with the\r\nrecumbent figure is that of Hugh Ashton, comptroller of the household\r\nto the Lady Margaret, a prebendary and Archdeacon of York. He was buried\r\nin the old Chapel, and this tomb originally stood in a chantry attached\r\nthereto. He founded four fellowships and four scholarships in the\r\nCollege, the Fellows being bound to sing Mass for the repose of his\r\nsoul. The carving on the tomb and on the finials of the railing around\r\nit include a rebus on his name, an ash-tree growing out of a barrel\r\n(ash-tun). On the north wall is a bust of Dr. Isaac Todhunter, the\r\nwell-known mathematical writer; on the western wall a tablet by\r\nChantrey, to the memory of Kirke White, the poet, who died in College.\r\nHe was buried in the chancel of the old Church of All Saints, which\r\nstood opposite to the College; when the church was pulled down the\r\ntablet was transferred to the College Chapel. The statue is that of\r\nJames Wood, sometime Master of the College, part of whose bequests went\r\ntowards building the Chapel. On the east wall is an old brass to the\r\nmemory of Nicholas Metcalfe, third Master of the College, the words\r\n\"_vestras ... preces vehementer expetit_\" have been partly obliterated,\r\nprobably during the Commonwealth. The roof of the Choir is of high\r\npitch, of quadripartite vaulting in oak, and is decorated with a\r\ncontinuous line of full-length figures. In the central bay at the east\r\nend is our Lord in Majesty, the other bays contain figures illustrating\r\nthe Christian centuries. Owing to the deep colour of the glass in the\r\nwindows, it is only on a very sunny day that the figures can be clearly\r\ndiscerned. The windows in the Choir have been given by various donors,\r\nthe subjects being scenes from Scripture at which St. John was present;\r\nhis figure robed in ruby and green will be seen in each. The five\r\nwindows in the apse, the gift of the Earl of Powis, High Steward of the\r\nUniversity, depict scenes from the Passion, Crucifixion, and\r\nResurrection of Christ. In the apse is preserved the double piscina\r\nwhich was found covered up in the walls of the Infirmary, and removed by\r\nSir G. G. Scott, with such repairs as were absolutely necessary. It is\r\nprobably one of the oldest specimens of carved stonework in Cambridge.\r\n\r\nThe steps leading up to the Altar are paved with Purbeck, Sicilian, and\r\nblack Derbyshire marbles. The spaces between the steps are decorated\r\nwith a series of scriptural subjects in inlaid work in black and white\r\nmarble, with distinctive inscriptions. The Altar is of oak, with a\r\nsingle slab of Belgian marble for its top. On the sides of the Altar are\r\ndeeply carved panels; that in the centre represents the Lamb with the\r\nBanner, the other panels contain the emblems of the four Evangelists.\r\n\r\nThe organ stands in a special chamber on the north side; the carved\r\nfront was not put in place till 1890. It was designed by Mr. J. Oldrid\r\nScott, a son of Sir Gilbert Scott. In 1635 the famous Robert Dallam of\r\nWestminster built a \"paire of new orgaines\" for the College. The organ\r\nhas been repeatedly enlarged, altered, and improved; it may be that some\r\nof Dallam's work still remains, though this is uncertain. The present\r\norgan is one of the best in Cambridge; its tone throughout is uniformly\r\nbeautiful.\r\n\r\nThe brass reading-desk was given to the old Chapel by the Rev. Thomas\r\nWhytehead, a Fellow of the College; the pedestal is copied from the\r\nwooden lectern in Ramsay Church, Huntingdonshire; the finials, which are\r\nthere wanting, having been restored, and the wooden desk replaced by an\r\neagle.\r\n\r\nAs we return to the Ante-Chapel we may note the great west window,\r\nrepresenting the Last Judgment; this was given by the Bachelors and\r\nUndergraduates of the College. There are also windows in the Ante-Chapel\r\nto the memory of Dr. Ralph Tatham, Master of the College, and to the\r\nRev. J. J. Blunt, Lady Margaret Professor of Divinity.\r\n\r\nThe oil-painting which hangs on the south wall of the Ante-Chapel near\r\nthe door--a Descent from the Cross--is by Anthony Raphael Mengs. It was\r\ngiven to the College in 1841 by the Right Hon. Robert Henry Clive, M.P.\r\nfor Shropshire.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Hall._\r\n\r\nWe enter the Hall from the Screens, between the First and Second Courts.\r\nThe southern end is part of the original building of the College. It was\r\nat first about seventy feet long, with one oriel only, the old\r\nCombination Room being beyond it. When the new Chapel was built the Hall\r\nwas lengthened, and the second oriel window added. The oak panelling is\r\nof the old \"linen\" pattern, and dates from the sixteenth century; that\r\nlining the north wall, beyond the High Table, is very elaborately\r\ncarved, being the finest example of such work in Cambridge. Within\r\nliving memory all this oak work was painted green. The fine timbered\r\nroof has a lantern turret, beneath which, until 1865, stood an open\r\ncharcoal brazier. From allusions in early documents it would appear that\r\nmembers of the Society gathered round the brazier for conversation after\r\nmeals. In addition to its use as a dining-room, the Hall also served as\r\na lecture-room, and for the production of stage plays. On these latter\r\noccasions it seems to have been specially decorated, for Roger Ascham,\r\nwriting 1st October 1550, from Antwerp, to his brother Fellow, Edward\r\nRaven, tried to picture to him the magnificence of the city by saying\r\nthat it surpassed all others which he had visited, as much as the Hall\r\nat St. John's, when decorated for a play at Christmas, surpassed its\r\nappearance at ordinary times.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Hall, St. John's College]\r\n\r\nMany of the College examinations are held in the Hall, and in the days\r\nof the brazier, examinees were warned by their Tutors not to sit too\r\nnear the brazier; the comfort from the heat being dearly purchased by\r\nthe drowsiness caused by the fumes of the charcoal.\r\n\r\nMany interesting portraits hang on the walls. That of the foundress in\r\nthe centre of the north wall is painted on wooden panel, and is very\r\nold. She is flanked by Lord Keeper Williams, and by Sir Ralph Hare,\r\nK.C.B., both benefactors to the College. Other noteworthy portraits are\r\nthose of Sir Noah Thomas, physician to King George III., by Romney;\r\nWilliam Wordsworth, poet-laureate, by Pickersgill; Professor John E. B.\r\nMayor, by Herkomer; Professor B. H. Kennedy, long headmaster of\r\nShrewsbury School, by Ouless; Professor E. H. Palmer, Lord Almoner's\r\nReader of Arabic in the University, and a famous oriental scholar, by\r\nthe Hon. John Collier; and Professor G. D. Liveing, by Sir George Reid.\r\n\r\nThe shields in the windows are those of distinguished members of the\r\nCollege, or benefactors. The further oriel window has busts of Sir John\r\nF. W. Herschel and Professor John Couch Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Combination Room._\r\n\r\nWe enter by the staircase at the north end of the Hall. This was\r\noriginally about 187 feet long, extending the whole length of the Second\r\nCourt, and was used as a gallery in connection with the old Master's\r\nLodge. The ceiling dates from 1600, and the panelling from 1603. In 1624\r\nabout 42 feet were sacrificed to obtain a staircase and vestibule for\r\nthe Library; the ceiling can be traced right through. In the eighteenth\r\ncentury partitions were put up, dividing up the gallery into rooms.\r\nWhen the new Master's Lodge was built these partitions were removed, and\r\nthe whole now forms two Combination Rooms.\r\n\r\nIn the oriel window on the south side is an old stained-glass portrait\r\nof Henrietta Maria, Queen of King Charles I. The tradition runs that the\r\nmarriage articles between Prince Charles and Henrietta Maria were signed\r\nin this room; King James I. was at that time holding his Court in\r\nTrinity College.\r\n\r\nA number of interesting portraits hang on the walls: George Augustus\r\nSelwyn, Bishop of New Zealand, afterwards of Lichfield, by George\r\nRichmond, R.A.; a chalk drawing (also by Richmond) of William Tyrrell,\r\nBishop of Newcastle, New South Wales; of Sir John Herschel and Professor\r\nJ. C. Adams; of William Wilberforce and Thomas Clarkson, the opponents\r\nof the slave-trade. There is also a very beautiful sketch of the head of\r\nWilliam Wordsworth; this study was made by Pickersgill to save the poet\r\nthe tedium of long sittings for the portrait in the Hall. It was\r\npresented to the College by Miss Arundale, a descendant of the painter.\r\nThe smaller Combination Room contains many engraved portraits of\r\ndistinguished members of the College.\r\n\r\nThe institution of the Combination Room seems gradually to have grown up\r\nin colleges as a place where the Fellows might meet together, partly\r\nabout business, partly for the sake of society. In early times, as the\r\nFellows shared their chambers with their pupils, there could have been\r\nno privacy. The room seems to have been called the Parlour for some\r\ntime; the name Combination Room is now universal at Cambridge, and may\r\nhave arisen from the fact that the cost of running the room was met by\r\nthe Fellows combining together for the purpose. At the present time the\r\nCombination Room is used for College meetings, as a room where the\r\nFellows meet for a short time after dinner and for dessert on those\r\nnights when there is a dinner in Hall to which guests are invited.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Library._\r\n\r\nThe Library is only open to visitors by leave of the Librarian, or to\r\nthose accompanied by a Fellow of the College. The usual access is by\r\nstaircase E in the Second Court, but leaving the Combination Room by the\r\nwest door we find ourselves in front of the Library door. The visitor\r\nmay note that the moulded ceiling of the Combination Room extends\r\noverhead. This portion, as we have already seen, originally forming part\r\nof the long gallery.\r\n\r\nThe door of the Library is surmounted by the arms of John Williams,\r\nimpaled with those of the see of Lincoln. The original position of the\r\nLibrary, as has been already stated, was in the First Court, next the\r\nstreet, and to the south of the entrance gate. In 1616 the books were\r\nmoved out of this Library to a room over the Kitchen, and in the\r\nsucceeding year the Master and Fellows wrote to the Countess of\r\nShrewsbury to intimate their intention of building a Library, and\r\nhinting at the possibility of her aid in the scheme. The answer of the\r\nCountess, if there was one, has not been preserved. In the year 1623,\r\nValentine Carey, Bishop of Exeter, and a former Fellow, wrote announcing\r\nthat an unnamed person had promised L1200 towards a Library. After some\r\nlittle time Lord Keeper Williams disclosed himself as the donor, and\r\nsome further advances were promised. The Library was commenced in 1623,\r\nand the books finally placed in it in 1628. The style of the building is\r\nJacobean Gothic, and its interior, with the whitewashed walls and dark\r\noak roof and bookcases, is singularly striking. John Evelyn visited it\r\nwhile at Cambridge in 1654, and describes it as \"the fairest of that\r\nUniversity\"; after 250 years the description still holds good.\r\n\r\nThe upper part of the Library has been little altered since it was\r\nbuilt. The intermediate (or lower) cases were heightened to the extent\r\nof one shelf for folios when Thomas Baker left his books to the College;\r\nbut two, one on either hand next the door, retain their original\r\ndimensions, with the sloping tops to be used as reading-desks.\r\n\r\nAt the end of each of the taller cases, in small compartments with\r\ndoors, are class catalogues written about 1685. These catalogues have\r\nbeen pasted over original catalogues written about 1640; small portions\r\nof the earlier catalogues are yet to be seen in some of the cases. Of\r\nthe treasures in manuscript and print only a slight account can be given\r\nhere. One of the most interesting to members of the College is the\r\nfollowing note by John Couch Adams:--\r\n\r\n     \"1841 July 3. Formed a design, in the beginning of this week,\r\n     of investigating, as soon as possible after taking my degree,\r\n     the irregularities in the motion of Uranus, wh. are yet\r\n     unaccounted for; in order to find whether they may be\r\n     attributed to the action of an undiscovered planet beyond it;\r\n     and if possible thence to determine the elements of its orbit,\r\n     &c. approximately, wh. wd. probably lead to its discovery.\"\r\n\r\nThe original memorandum is bound up in a volume containing the\r\nmathematical calculations by which Adams carried out his design and\r\ndiscovered the planet Neptune.\r\n\r\nLord Keeper Williams, who was instrumental in building the Library,\r\npresented to it many books; amongst others, the Bible known as\r\nCromwell's Bible. Thomas Cromwell employed Miles Coverdale to revise\r\nexisting translations, and this Bible was printed partly in Paris and\r\npartly in London, \"and finished in Aprill, A.D. 1539.\" Two copies were\r\nprinted on vellum--one for King Henry VIII., the other for Thomas, Lord\r\nCromwell, his Vicar-General. This College copy is believed to be that\r\npresented to Cromwell, and is now unique, the other copy having\r\ndisappeared from the Royal Library; the volume is beautifully\r\nillustrated, and has been described as \"the finest book in vellum that\r\nexists.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the show-cases in the centre contains the service-book which King\r\nCharles I. held in his hand at his coronation, and the book used by Laud\r\non the same occasion, with a note in Laud's handwriting: \"The daye was\r\nverye faire, and ye ceremony was performed wthout any Interruption,\r\nand in verye good order.\" The same case contains the mortuary roll of\r\nAmphelissa, Prioress of Lillechurch in Kent, who died in 1299. The nuns\r\nof the priory announce her death, commemorate her virtues, and ask the\r\nbenefit of the prayers of the faithful for her soul. The roll consists\r\nof nineteen sheets of parchment stitched together; its length is 39 ft.\r\n3 in., and its average width is about 7 in. There are in all 372 entries\r\nof the ecclesiastical houses visited by the roll-bearer for the purpose\r\nof gaining prayers for the soul of Amphelissa. The roll-bearer visited\r\nnearly all parts of England: there are entries by houses at Bodmin and\r\nLaunceston in Cornwall; at Dunfermline and St. Andrews in Scotland; each\r\nhouse granting the benefit of its prayers, and concluding in each case\r\nwith the formula, \"_Oravimus pro vestris: orate pro nostris._\" As a\r\ncollection of contemporary handwritings, such a document has great\r\nvalue; and it is interesting to note that in 600 years the roll has had\r\nonly two owners, the Priory of Lillechurch and the College, which\r\nsucceeded to its possession.\r\n\r\nIn this case there is also an IOU of King Charles II.: \"I do acknowledge\r\nto have received the summe of one hundred pounds, by the direction of\r\nMr. B., Brusselles the first of April 1660. CHARLES R.\" The \"Mr. B.\" was\r\nJohn Barwick, a Fellow of the College, afterwards Dean of St. Paul's.\r\nThe date seems to indicate that the money was advanced to enable Charles\r\nto return to England for the Restoration.\r\n\r\nIn the other show-case there is a very curious Irish Psalter of the\r\neighth century, with crude drawings. Its value is much increased by the\r\nfact that the Latin text is interlined throughout with glosses in the\r\nIrish dialect.\r\n\r\nOf printed books one of the choicest is a very fine Caxton, \"The Boke of\r\nTulle of old age; Tullius his book of Friendship.\" The volume contains\r\nthe autograph of Thomas Fairfax, the Parliamentary General, who entered\r\nthe College in 1626. It was presented to the College by Dr. Newcome,\r\nMaster from 1735 to 1765. To Dr. Newcome the College owes a very fine\r\ncollection of early printed classics; among these is a copy of Ovid,\r\nprinted by Jacobus Rubaeus at Venice in 1474; this was formerly in the\r\npossession of Lorenzo de Medicis.\r\n\r\nDr. Newcome and Thomas Baker share between them the distinction of\r\nhaving added many of the chief glories of the Library. Matthew Prior,\r\nthe poet, a Fellow of the College, presented his own works and many\r\ninteresting French and Italian works on history. There is also a\r\npresentation copy from Wordsworth of his poems.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Kitchen._\r\n\r\nThe Kitchen (opposite to the Hall) may sometimes be visited when the\r\ndaily routine permits. The whole has been recently modernised, and a\r\npicturesque open fire with rotating spits done away with. To gain more\r\nair-space it was necessary to incorporate in the Kitchen some rooms in\r\nthe floor above. One of these was the set occupied during his College\r\nlife by the poet Wordsworth, and the fact is commemorated by a\r\nstained-glass window.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Library: St. John's Coll:]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                  THE HOSPITAL OF ST. JOHN\r\n\r\n                       CIRCA 1135-1511\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. John's College, as we know it, was founded in 1511, and opened in\r\n1516. But at the time of its foundation it took over the buildings and\r\nproperty, and many of the duties, of an earlier and then a venerable\r\nfoundation, that of the Hospital of St. John the Evangelist in\r\nCambridge. The origin of the old house is obscure, and its earlier\r\nhistory lost, but it seems to have been founded about 1135 by Henry\r\nFrost, a burgess of Cambridge. It consisted of a small community of\r\nAugustinian canons; its site was described about 140 years later as \"a\r\nvery poor and waste place of the commonalty of Cambridge.\"\r\n\r\nWhatever its early history and endowments may have been, it formed a\r\nnucleus for further gifts; and its chartulary, still in the possession\r\nof St. John's College, shows a continuous series of benefactions to the\r\nold house.\r\n\r\nFounded before the University existed, the brethren were occupied with\r\ntheir religious duties, and with the care of the poor and sick who\r\nsought their help. An Infirmary, part of which was adapted for worship,\r\nwas built. In the thirteenth century a chapel was added, afterwards\r\nadapted as the College Chapel, and used as such down to 1869.\r\n\r\nOf the domestic buildings practically nothing is known. When some years\r\nago trenches were dug to lay the electric cables for the lighting of the\r\nHall, some traces of a pavement of red tiles were found near the\r\nentrance gate of the College.\r\n\r\nThe Hospital had the opportunity of becoming the earliest College in\r\nCambridge. Hugo de Balsham, Bishop of Ely, obtained in 1280 a licence\r\nfrom King Edward I. to introduce a certain number of scholars of the\r\nUniversity into the Hospital, to be governed according to the rules of\r\nthe scholars of Merton. The regular canons and the scholars were to form\r\none body and one College. The Bishop gave additional endowments to\r\nprovide for the scholars, but the scheme was a failure. Thomas Baker,\r\nthe historian of the College, suggests that \"the scholars were overwise\r\nand the brethren over good.\" All we do know is that both were eager to\r\npart company. The Bishop accordingly removed the scholars in 1284 to his\r\nCollege of Peterhouse, now known as the oldest College in Cambridge. His\r\nendowments were transferred with the scholars, and perhaps something\r\nbesides, for shortly afterwards the brethren complained of their losses.\r\nIt was then decreed that Peterhouse should pay twenty shillings\r\nannually to the Hospital, an acknowledgment of seniority still made by\r\nPeterhouse to St. John's College.\r\n\r\nFor another two hundred years the Hospital went on, not however\r\nforgetting its temporary dignity, and occasionally describing itself, in\r\nleases of its property, as the College of St. John.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the fifteenth, or beginning of the sixteenth century,\r\nthe old house seems to have fallen into bad ways. The brethren were\r\naccused of having squandered its belongings, of having granted\r\nimprovident leases, of having even sold the holy vessels of their\r\nChapel.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture the Lady Margaret came to the rescue. She had already\r\nfounded Christ's College in Cambridge, and intended to still further\r\nendow the wealthy Abbey of Westminster. Her religious adviser, John\r\nFisher, sometime Master of Michael-House and President of Queens'\r\nCollege in Cambridge, then Bishop of Rochester and Chancellor of the\r\nUniversity, persuaded her to bestow further gifts on Cambridge,\r\nsuggesting the Hospital of St. John as the basis for the new College.\r\nThe then Bishop of Ely, James Stanley, was her stepson, and in 1507 an\r\nagreement was entered into with him for the suppression of the Hospital\r\nand the foundation of the College, the Lady Margaret undertaking to\r\nobtain the requisite Bull from the Pope, and the licence of the King.\r\nBefore this could be carried out King Henry VII. died, 21st April 1509,\r\nand the Lady Margaret on the 29th June following.\r\n\r\nBy her will she had set aside lands to the annual value of L400 for the\r\nnew College; but innumerable difficulties sprang up. King Henry VIII.\r\nwas not sympathetic; the Bishop of Ely raised difficulties; the Lady\r\nMargaret's own household claimed part of her goods. Fisher has left a\r\nquaintly worded and touching memorandum of the difficulties he\r\nexperienced, but he never despaired. He ultimately got the licence of\r\nthe King, the requisite Papal Bull, and the consent of the Bishop of\r\nEly. From a letter to Fisher, still preserved in the College, it appears\r\nthat the \"Brethren, late of St. John's House, departed from Cambridge\r\ntoward Ely the 12th day of March (1510-11) at four of the clokke at\r\nafternone, by water.\"\r\n\r\nAll facts which have been preserved show Fisher to have been the real\r\nmoving spirit--to have been the founder in effect, if not in name, and\r\nthe College from the first has always linked his name with that of the\r\nfoundress. Of the foundress' estates only one small farm, at Fordham, in\r\nCambridgeshire, came to the College, and that because it was charged\r\nwith the payment of her debts. What did come was part of what would now\r\nbe called her personal estate--moneys she had out on loan, and what\r\ncould be realised from the sale of her plate and jewels, the furniture\r\nand hangings of her various mansions. Rough priced-lists of these,\r\nprobably handed over by Fisher, are preserved in College.\r\n\r\nOne personal relic, a manuscript Book of Hours, which belonged to her,\r\nwas in 1902 presented to the Library by Dr. Alexander Peckover,\r\nLord-Lieutenant of Cambridgeshire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n                      THE FIRST CENTURY\r\n\r\n                          1511-1612\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hospital being closed, the way was cleared for the new College. The\r\nCharter, signed by the Executors of the Lady Margaret, is dated 9th\r\nApril 1511; in this Robert Shorton is named as Master. He held office\r\nuntil on 29th July 1516 the College was opened, when Alan Percy, of the\r\nNorthumberland House, succeeded. He again was succeeded in 1518 by\r\nNicholas Metcalfe, a member of the Metcalfe family of Nappa Hall, in\r\nWensleydale. Metcalfe had been Archdeacon of Rochester, and was no doubt\r\nwell known to Fisher as Bishop of that Diocese.\r\n\r\nThe building of the College commenced under Shorton, but was not\r\nfinished until about 1520.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that the College was founded before the\r\nReformation, and that these three Masters were priests of the Church of\r\nRome.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OLD BRIDGE]\r\n\r\nMetcalfe was more of an administrator than a student, and his energies\r\nwere chiefly devoted to the material side of the College interests.\r\nFresh endowments were obtained in place of those which had been lost.\r\nKing Henry VIII. was persuaded to hand over to the College the estates\r\nof three decayed religious houses--the Maison Dieu at Ospringe, the\r\nNunnery of Lillechurch in Higham, both in Kent, and the Nunnery of\r\nBroomhall in Berkshire. As these houses, as well as the Hospital, had\r\nallowed their affairs to fall into disorder, it is probable that the\r\nidentification of their lands, and the reduction of these to effective\r\npossession, was a matter of some difficulty. Metcalfe was much absent\r\nfrom College; the accounts of his private expenditure on these journeys\r\nhave survived, and letters to him from the College during his absences\r\nshow that his skill and wisdom were much relied on.\r\n\r\nFisher also gave largely to the College, and through his example and\r\ninfluence others were induced to endow fellowships and scholarships. He\r\ngave three successive codes of statutes for the government of the\r\nCollege in 1516, 1524, and 1530. These present no novel features, being\r\nfor the most part based on existing statutes of Colleges at Oxford or\r\nCambridge. They are long, and, as the fashion then was, lay down many\r\nrules with regard to minor matters. A few of the leading provisions may\r\nbe given. One scholar was to be Chapel clerk, to assist the sacrist at\r\nMass; another was to ring the great bell at 4 A.M., as was done before\r\nthe College was founded, and again at 8 P.M., when the gates were\r\nclosed; another was to be clock-keeper. These three scholars were to be\r\nexempt from all other domestic duties, except that of reading the Bible\r\nin time of plague. Seven scholars were told off to serve as waiters in\r\nHall, to bring in and remove the food and dishes; an eighth was to read\r\nthe Bible in Hall while the Society were at dinner. When in honour of\r\nGod, or the Saints, a fire was made up in Hall, the Fellows, scholars,\r\nand servants might stay to amuse themselves with singing and repeating\r\npoetry and tales. The Master, Fellows, and scholars were to wear\r\nclerical dress; red, white, green, or parti-coloured boots were\r\nforbidden.\r\n\r\nOne-fourth part of the Fellows were always to be engaged in preaching to\r\nthe people in English; Bachelors of Divinity, preaching at Paul's Cross,\r\nwere to be allowed ten days of absence for each sermon. No arms were to\r\nbe borne, though archery was allowed as a recreation. No Fellow or\r\nscholar was allowed to keep hounds, ferrets, hawks, or singing-birds in\r\nCollege. The weekly allowance for commons was 1s. for the Master and\r\neach Fellow, 7d. for each scholar. The President or Bursar was to\r\nreceive a stipend of 40s. a year, a Dean 26s. 8d. No one under the\r\nstanding of a Doctor of Divinity was to have a separate room; Fellows\r\nand scholars were to sleep singly, or not more than two in a bed. Each\r\nroom was to have two beds--the higher for the Fellow, the lower or\r\ntruckle-bed for the scholar; the truckle-bed being tucked under the\r\nother during the day.\r\n\r\nThe College made an excellent start, and was soon full of earnest and\r\nsuccessful students. It is sufficient to mention the names of Sir John\r\nCheke, the famous Greek scholar; of Roger Ascham, the tutor of Queen\r\nElizabeth; and, in another sphere, William Cecil, first Lord Burghley,\r\nto give an idea of the influence the College was spreading through her\r\nsons.\r\n\r\nIn all this Metcalfe had his share. He is the \"Good Master of a College\"\r\nin Fuller's _Holy State_, where we read: \"Grant that Metcalfe with\r\nThemistocles could not fiddle, yet he could make a little city a great\r\none.\" And Ascham in _The Scholemaster_ writes of him: \"His goodnes stood\r\nnot still in one or two, but flowed aboundantlie over all that Colledge,\r\nand brake out also to norishe good wittes in every part of that\r\nuniversitie; whereby at his departing thence, he left soch a companie of\r\nfellowes and scholers in S. Johnes Colledge as can scarce be found now\r\nin som whole universitie: which either for divinitie on the one side or\r\nother, or for civill service to their Prince and contrie, have bene, and\r\nare yet to this day, notable ornaments to this whole Realme. Yea S.\r\nJohnes did then so florish, as Trinitie College, that princely house\r\nnow, at the first erection was but _Colonia deducta_ out of S. Johnes,\r\nnot onelie for their Master, fellowes and scholers, but also, which is\r\nmore, for their whole both order of learning, and discipline of maners;\r\nand yet to this day it never tooke Master but such as was bred up before\r\nin S. Johnes; doing the dewtie of a good _colonia_ to her _metropolis_,\r\nas the auncient cities in Greice, and some yet in Italie at this time\r\nare accustomed to do.\"\r\n\r\nBut troubles were in store both for Fisher and Metcalfe. The\r\nReformation, the divorce of Henry VIII. from Queen Catherine, the Act of\r\nSuccession, and the sovereign's views on the royal supremacy, were the\r\nstumbling-blocks. Fisher went to the Tower, and on 22nd June 1535, to\r\nthe scaffold; Metcalfe was compelled to resign in 1537.\r\n\r\nFisher had by deed of gift presented his library to the College, but\r\nretained its use for his lifetime--the greatest loan of books on record,\r\nas has been said. This magnificent collection was now lost, a loss more\r\nlamentable than that of the foundress' estates. Endowments might be\r\nreplaced, but \"the notablest library of bookes in all England\" was gone\r\nfor ever. It is to the credit of the Fellows of the College that, no\r\ndoubt at some risk to themselves, they stood by Fisher. They visited him\r\nin his prison, and in a nobly worded letter stated that as they owed\r\neverything to his bounty, so they offered themselves and all they were\r\nmasters of to his service.\r\n\r\nIn 1545 King Henry VIII. gave new statutes to the College, adapted to\r\nthe reformed religion; but all mention of Fisher and his endowments is\r\ncut out; the College even had to pay 3d. for removing his armorial\r\nbearings from the Chapel.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of King Edward VI. the outspoken and eloquent Thomas\r\nLeaver was Master; on the accession of Queen Mary he, with many of the\r\nFellows, had to fly to Switzerland. In Ascham's words: \"mo perfite\r\nscholers were dispersed from thence in one moneth, than many years can\r\nreare up againe.\"\r\n\r\nThe reign of Queen Mary did not extend over much more than five years,\r\nbut while it lasted a resolute and unflinching effort was made to\r\nre-establish the Roman Catholic faith.\r\n\r\nThe accession of Queen Elizabeth resulted in an equally rapid and\r\nfundamental revolution of opinion on the most vital points which can\r\ninterest mankind. A few selected extracts from the College Account Books\r\nfor this period bring before us, with almost dramatic effect, the\r\nchanges which occurred. (Queen Mary succeeded in 1553, Queen Elizabeth\r\non 17th November 1558.)\r\n\r\n\"1555, To the joyner for setting up the rood, 2_d._; A new graell\r\nprinted in parchment 40_s._;--1556, In Spanish money given to the\r\ngoldsmyth by Mr Willan to make a pixe to the highe Aultar, 24_s._\r\n11_d._; A redde purple velvet cope, with the border of imagrie, having\r\nthe assumption of our Ladie behinde and three little angels about her\r\nand the greater being full of floure de luces, 46_s._ 8_d._;--1557, To\r\nWilliam Allom for two antiphoners, one masse book and hymnal and\r\nprocessioners, L6 13_s._ 4_d._\"\r\n\r\n\"1558, To John Waller and his man for a dayes working pulling down the\r\nhye Altar and carrying it away 20_d._; For pulling down the aulter in Mr\r\nAshton's Chapel 6_d._; 1563, Received for certain old Albes and other\r\npopishe Trashe, sold out of the Revystry the last yere, 26_s._ 10_d._;\r\nPaid to Mr Baxter for ten Geneva psalters and six service psalters,\r\nbought at Christmas last, 22_s._\"\r\n\r\nThis last entry gives us the key to the troubles at St. John's; the\r\nMarian exiles had returned with strong Calvinistic leanings. The unrest\r\nwas, of course, not confined to St. John's, but was general throughout\r\nthe University. But for the greater part of the reign of Elizabeth there\r\nwas a strong leaning toward Puritanism in the College. There was a rapid\r\nsuccession of Masters, most of whom were thrust on the College by Court\r\ninfluence; and about this time the Fellows of St. John's acquired the\r\nreputation of being \"cunning practitioners\" in the art of getting rid of\r\nunpopular Masters.\r\n\r\nQueen Elizabeth visited Cambridge in August 1564, and was received with\r\nall honour. She rode into the Hall of St. John's on her palfrey and\r\nlistened to a speech from Mr. Humphrey Bohun, one of the Fellows, in\r\nwhich for the last time the restitution of the Lady Margaret's estates\r\nwas hinted at, without result.\r\n\r\nRichard Longworth, a man of Presbyterian sympathies, was at this time\r\nMaster. In 1565 he, with the Fellows and scholars, appeared in Chapel\r\nwithout the surplice. Lord Burghley, as Chancellor of the University,\r\nwrote a sharply worded letter to Longworth, expressing his grief that\r\nsuch a thing should happen in \"my dear College of St. John's\"; adding,\r\n\"truly no mishap in all my service did ever plunge me more grievously.\"\r\n\r\nFortunately affairs were in strong and capable hands. With the authority\r\nand in the name of Queen Elizabeth, Whitgift, at this time Master of\r\nTrinity, afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury, and Cecil provided new\r\nstatutes for the University in 1570, and for St. John's in 1580. By\r\nthese much more power was put in the hands of the Master, and government\r\nrendered easier to a resolute man.\r\n\r\nMatters improved, if not at once, at least gradually, and the Anglican\r\nrule became firmly established. But during the mastership of William\r\nWhitaker (1586-1595) we still hear of troubles with \"Papists.\" Whitaker\r\nwas a learned scholar and an acute theologian, but he does not seem to\r\nhave been a ruler of men or a judge of character. He got involved in an\r\nunfortunate dispute with Everard Digby, one of the Fellows, a man of\r\nconsiderable literary reputation, but of a turbulent disposition.\r\nWhitaker, who clearly wanted to get rid of Digby, seized upon the\r\npretext that his bill for a month's commons, amounting to 8s. 7-1/4d., was\r\nleft unpaid, and deprived Digby of his fellowship. An appeal was lodged\r\nwith Whitgift and Cecil, who ordered Whitaker to reinstate Digby.\r\nWhitaker replied that Digby was a Papist, was wont to blow a horn in the\r\nCourts and to holloa after it, and that he had threatened to put the\r\nPresident in the stocks! He seems to have succeeded in getting rid of\r\nDigby for good.\r\n\r\nOn the death of Whitaker in 1595, Richard Clayton became Master. If not\r\na brilliant scholar, he commanded respect, and the tenor of many letters\r\nwhich have come down from that time shows that the Fellows in residence\r\nwere on good terms with each other, and with those of the Society who\r\nhad gone out into the world. The College was prosperous, and the\r\nbuilding of the Second Court was the visible sign of returned\r\nefficiency. Clayton lived on into the reign of King James I., dying 2nd\r\nMay 1612; besides being Master of St. John's, he was also Dean of\r\nPeterborough and a Prebendary of Lincoln.\r\n\r\nDuring this period the College enjoyed a considerable reputation as a\r\ntraining ground for medical men. Thomas Linacre, physician to Henry\r\nVIII., founded in 1534 a medical lectureship in the College, endowing it\r\nwith some property in London. The stipend of the lecturer was to be L12\r\na year, no mean sum in these days--being, in fact, the same as the\r\nstatutable stipend of the Master. In the Elizabethan statutes special\r\nand detailed provisions are made for the continuance of the lectureship.\r\nThese lay down that the lecturer must be versed in the works of\r\nAristotle, and that he should lecture on the works of Galen, which\r\nLinacre had translated. The effect of the foundation was to attract a\r\nnumber of medical students to the College, many of whom seem to have\r\nobtained fellowships, for we find the Fellows petitioning Queen\r\nElizabeth, while her code of statutes was under consideration, that\r\nDivines should be preferred to Physicians in the election of Senior\r\nFellows; otherwise, they submitted, an undue proportion of Physicians\r\nwould get on the seniority and rule the College. Further, they asked\r\nthat the medical Fellows, as some return for their privileges, should\r\nattend on poor students free of charge. That the College school of\r\nmedicine was a noted one is confirmed by the fact that three successive\r\nPresidents of the Royal College of Physicians were Fellows of St.\r\nJohn's: Richard Smith (1585-1589), William Baronsdale (1589-1600), and\r\nWilliam Gilbert (1600-1601). Smith and Gilbert were physicians to Queen\r\nElizabeth; Baronsdale and Gilbert had been Senior Bursars of the\r\nCollege. Of these Gilbert is the most celebrated; his treatise, _De\r\nMagnete_, is a scientific classic. Galileo spoke of Gilbert as \"great to\r\na degree which might be envied.\" Francis Bacon mentions the book with\r\napplause, and Hallam describes Gilbert as \"at once the father of\r\nexperimental philosophy in this island, and by a singular felicity and\r\nacuteness of genius, the founder of theories which have been revived\r\nafter the lapse of ages, and are almost universally received into the\r\ncreed of science.\" Gilbert, who always signs his name Gilberd or Gylberd\r\nin the College books, was Senior Bursar of the College in 1569, and\r\nPresident in the succeeding year.\r\n\r\nAmongst others who have held the Linacre lectureship, and attained to\r\nscientific distinction, was Henry Briggs, who was appointed lecturer in\r\n1592. He afterwards became Gresham Professor of Geometry and Savilian\r\nProfessor at Oxford. He took up Napier's discovery of logarithms; the\r\nidea of tables of logarithms having 10 for their base, and the\r\ncalculation of the first table of the kind, is due to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n                     THE SECOND CENTURY\r\n\r\n                          1612-1716\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second century of the College history opened quietly. Owen Gwyn was\r\nelected Master by the choice of the Fellows; John Williams, then a\r\nFellow, afterwards Lord Keeper, Dean of Westminster, Bishop of Lincoln,\r\nand Archbishop of York, exerting himself on Gwyn's behalf. It appears\r\nthat Williams in after years repented of the choice, and Thomas Baker,\r\nthe historian of the College, speaks slightingly of Gwyn. Still, under\r\nhis rule the College flourished, and Williams himself marked the period\r\nby providing the greater part of the funds for the new Library.\r\n\r\nKing James I. and Prince Charles (afterwards Charles I.) frequently\r\nvisited the University; James holding his Court at Trinity, but being\r\nentertained at St. John's. On one of these occasions, comparing the\r\ngreat Court of Trinity with the two then existing Courts of St. John's,\r\nhe is said to have remarked that there was no greater difference between\r\nthe two Societies than between a shilling and two sixpences.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _HALL, AND CHAPEL TOWER_]\r\n\r\nWith the advent of the Stuart kings the practice arose of sending\r\nmandatory letters to Colleges, directing the election of named persons\r\nto fellowships. In theory it may have been correct enough; the statutes\r\nas enacted by Queen Elizabeth reserved to herself and her successors the\r\npower of rescinding or altering them. To direct that the statutory\r\nprovisions as to elections should be dispensed with in favour of an\r\nindividual was thus within the sovereign's power, however inconvenient\r\nit might prove in practice. One of the special grievances at St. John's\r\nwas that King James directed the College to elect a Scotchman, George\r\nSeaton, M.A., to a fellowship, though there was none then actually\r\nvacant. The College obeyed, informing his Majesty that they had made\r\ntheir statutes wink to fulfil his bidding, and maintained an extra\r\nFellow for a time. The practice was, however, followed by others; and\r\nGwyn seems to have been deluged with letters from persons in high\r\nplaces, begging for his favour at elections. At some Colleges the device\r\nof \"pre-elections\" seems to have been resorted to; a promising man being\r\nelected to the next fellowship which should be vacant. Thus, when the\r\nvacancy became known, the College could, with a clear conscience, say\r\nthat it had been already filled up; there is, however, no trace of this\r\npractice at St. John's.\r\n\r\nOn Gwyn's death in 1633 there was a disputed election to the mastership,\r\nwhich Charles I. settled by nominating William Beale. Beale was\r\noriginally a Trinity man, but had been for about a year Master of Jesus.\r\nHe was a supporter of Laud; he embellished the Chapel, and introduced a\r\nmore ornate ritual; under his influence St. John's seems to have been\r\nthe only College at Cambridge which fully complied with Laud's\r\ninstructions. Thus when the Puritans got the upper hand, Beale and his\r\nCollege were the subject of their displeasure.\r\n\r\nIn 1642 King Charles applied to the University for supplies. The\r\ncontribution of St. John's was L150 in money and 2065 ounces \"grocers\r\nweight\" of silver plate. The list of the pieces of plate and of the\r\ndonors' names is but melancholy reading; suffice it to say that among\r\nthose sent were pieces bearing the names of Thomas Wentworth, Lord\r\nStrafford, and of Thomas Fairfax. The fact that this plate actually\r\nreached the King did not endear the College to the parliamentary party.\r\nOliver Cromwell surrounded the College, took Dr. Beale a prisoner, and,\r\nto equalise matters, confiscated the communion plate and other\r\nvaluables.\r\n\r\nBeale, after some imprisonment and wandering, escaped from England and\r\nbecame chaplain to Lord Cottington and Sir Edward Hyde (afterwards Lord\r\nClarendon) in their embassy to Spain; he died at Madrid, and was there\r\nsecretly buried. A number of the Fellows were also ejected, and for\r\nsome time the College was used as a prison. The Chapel was stripped of\r\nthe obnoxious ornaments, and other damage done. A little bundle of\r\npapers labelled \"Receipts for Army taxes during the Commonwealth\" still\r\nreposes, as a memento of these days, in the Muniment Room.\r\n\r\nSt. John's, which dabbled in Presbyterian doctrines during the days of\r\nElizabeth, now had these imposed upon it by superior authority. The two\r\nCommonwealth Masters, John Arrowsmith (1644-1653) and Anthony Tuckney\r\n(1653-1661), were able men of Puritan austerity, the rule of the latter\r\nbeing the more strict; judging from the after careers of its members,\r\nthe College was certainly capably directed. A well-authenticated College\r\ntradition relates that when, at an election, the President called upon\r\nthe Master to have regard to the \"godly,\" Tuckney replied that no one\r\nshowed greater regard for the truly godly than himself, but that he was\r\ndetermined to choose none but scholars; adding, with practical wisdom,\r\n\"They may deceive me in their godliness; they cannot in their\r\nscholarship.\"\r\n\r\nOn the Restoration, Dr. Peter Gunning, afterwards Bishop of Ely, was\r\nmade Master; and the Earl of Manchester, who, as an officer of the\r\nParliament, was the means of ejecting many of the Fellows, now directed\r\nthat some of them should be restored to their places. An interesting\r\nCollege custom dates from this period: on the 29th of May in each year\r\nthe College butler decorates the Hall and Kitchen with fresh oak boughs;\r\nthere is no order to that effect, but--\"it has always been done.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE COLLEGE ARMS]\r\n\r\nThe rest of this century of the College existence, with the exception of\r\none exciting event, passed quietly enough. Such troubles as there were\r\nin College were but eddies of the storms in the world outside. Of the\r\n\"seven Bishops\" sent to the Tower by King James II. in 1688, three were\r\nof St. John's: Francis Turner, Bishop of Ely (who had been Master of the\r\nCollege from 1670 to 1679); John Lake, Bishop of Chichester; and Thomas\r\nWhite, Bishop of Peterborough.\r\n\r\nThe event of College interest was the fate of the nonjuring Fellows. The\r\nNonjurors were those who, on various grounds, honourable enough,\r\ndeclined to take the oath of allegiance to King William and Queen Mary.\r\nUnder the law they were liable to be deprived of their places and\r\nemoluments. At St. John's twenty Fellows and eight scholars took up the\r\nnonjuring position. In the rest of the University there were but\r\nfourteen in all, and the same number at the University of Oxford. No\r\nexplanation seems to be forthcoming as to why there was this\r\npreponderance of opinion at St. John's. It is difficult to believe that\r\nit was enthusiasm for the cause of James II.; for when in 1687 that King\r\ndirected the University to admit Father Alban Francis, a Benedictine\r\nmonk, to the degree of M.A. without making the subscription or taking\r\nthe oaths required for a degree, Thomas Smoult and John Billers, members\r\nof the College (the latter afterwards a Nonjuror), maintained the right\r\nof the University to refuse the degree before the notorious Judge\r\nJeffreys, after the Vice-Chancellor and Isaac Newton had been silenced.\r\n\r\nHumphrey Gower was at this time Master of the College; he was of Puritan\r\norigin, and entered the College during the Commonwealth. After the\r\nRestoration he joined the Church of England, and though his sympathies\r\nwere with the Nonjurors, he took the oaths and retained his mastership\r\nafter the flight of King James. He had been for less than six months\r\nMaster of Jesus before becoming Master of St. John's. Abraham de la\r\nPryme, a member of St. John's, has handed down an irreverent jest on his\r\nappointment. \"Our master, they say, is a mighty, high, proud man.... He\r\ncame from Jesus College to be master here, and he was so sevear that he\r\nwas commonly called the divel of Jesus; and when he was made master here\r\nsome unlucky scholars broke this jest upon him--that now the divel was\r\nentered into the heard of swine; for us Johnians are abusively called\r\nhoggs.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1693 the Court of King's Bench issued a _mandamus_ calling upon Gower\r\nto remove those Fellows who had not taken the oath. Defence upon the\r\nmerits of the case there was none; but Gower or his legal advisers\r\nopposed the mandate with great skill on technical points, and after much\r\nlitigation the Court had to admit that its procedure was irregular, and\r\nthe matter dropped for some twenty-four years. During this period some\r\nof the Fellows in question died, others ceded their fellowships owing to\r\nthe combined action of the general law and the College statutes. Under\r\nthe latter Fellows were bound, when of proper standing, to proceed to\r\nthe B.D. degree, but the oath of allegiance was required of those who\r\ntook the degree, and so fellowships were forfeited. Thomas Baker, the\r\nhistorian, who was one of the Nonjurors, had taken the B.D. degree\r\nbefore 1688, so this cause did not operate in his case. But on the\r\naccession of King George I., an abjuration oath was required, and the\r\nmeshes of the net being now smaller, the then Master, Dr. Jenkin, had no\r\nother course but to eject Baker and others. The College did all it could\r\nto soften the blow, and allowed Baker to reside in College until his\r\ndeath in 1740. He worked unweariedly at his manuscript collections and\r\nat the history of the College. The latter was first published in 1869,\r\nunder the editorship of Professor John E. B. Mayor; with the editor's\r\nadditions it forms a record of a College such as almost no other\r\nfoundation can show. Baker's learning and accuracy are undoubted; but it\r\nmay be permitted (even to a member of his College) to hint that Baker's\r\njudgments are a little severe, and his views somewhat narrow.\r\n\r\nOne notable improvement in the College records dates from this century.\r\nIn early days no record was made of the names of those who joined the\r\nCollege. The statutes of King Henry VIII. enjoined that a register\r\nshould be kept of all those admitted to scholarships and fellowships or\r\nCollege offices. This was begun in 1545, and has been continued to the\r\npresent time. The entries of scholars and Fellows are in the autograph\r\nof those admitted, and if they possessed no other interest, have that\r\nof providing numerous examples of contemporary handwriting. But of those\r\nnot admitted on the foundation, or of those admitted prior to 1545,\r\nthere is no official College record.\r\n\r\nDr. Owen Gwyn and the seniors of his day passed a rule that \"the\r\nregister of the College should have a book provided him wherein he\r\nshould from time to time write and register the names, parents, county,\r\nschool, age, and tutor of every one to be admitted to the College.\" This\r\nwas commenced in January 1629-30, and has been continued, with varying\r\ncare and exactness, ever since. It seems probable that the initiative in\r\nthis matter was due to Gwyn, as few Masters have so carefully preserved\r\ntheir official correspondence.\r\n\r\nJust before this general register commenced, three notable men joined\r\nthe College: Thomas Wentworth, afterwards Earl of Strafford; Thomas\r\nFairfax, afterwards Lord Fairfax, the victor at Naseby; and Lucius Cary,\r\nViscount Falkland, who fell in Newbury fight in September 1643.\r\nComplimentary letters to the first and last of these, with the replies,\r\nhave been preserved. Falkland, in his reply, complains that of the\r\ntitles given to him by the College \"that which I shold most willingly\r\nhave acknowledged and mought with most justice clayme you were not\r\npleased to vouchsafe me, that of a St. John's man.\"\r\n\r\nOf others who entered we may name: Sir Ingram Hopton, son of Ralph,\r\nfirst Baron Hopton, who entered as a Fellow Commoner 12th May 1631. Sir\r\nIngram fell at the battle of Winceby, 11th October 1643. He there\r\nunhorsed Oliver Cromwell in a charge, and knocked him down again as he\r\nrose, but was himself killed.\r\n\r\nTitus Oates, \"the infamous,\" first entered at Caius 29th June 1667,\r\nmigrating to St. John's, where he entered 2nd February 1668-69. Thomas\r\nBaker for once abandons his decorous reticence and states of Oates: \"He\r\nwas a lyar from the beginning, he stole and cheated his taylor of a\r\ngown, which he denied with horrid imprecations, and afterwards at a\r\ncommunion, being admonisht and advised by his Tutor, confest the fact.\"\r\n\r\nMatthew Prior, the poet, was both scholar and Fellow of the College,\r\nholding his fellowship until his death. Robert Herrick, though he\r\ngraduated at Trinity Hall, was sometime a Fellow Commoner here. Thomas\r\nForster of Adderstone, general to the \"Old Pretender,\" and commander of\r\nthe Jacobite army in 1715, entered the College as a Fellow Commoner 3rd\r\nJuly 1700. Brook Taylor, well known to mathematicians as the discoverer\r\nof \"Taylor's theorem,\" entered as a Fellow Commoner 3rd April 1701.\r\nWhile David Mossom of Greenwich, who entered the College as a sizar 5th\r\nJune 1705, after being ordained, emigrated to America, and became\r\nrector of St. Peter's Church, New Kent County, Virginia. He was the\r\nofficiating clergyman at the marriage of George Washington in St.\r\nPeter's Church.\r\n\r\nWe get an amusing glimpse of the importance of the Master of a College\r\nin the following anecdote: \"In the year 1712 my old friend, Matthew\r\nPrior, who was then Fellow of St. John's, and who not long before had\r\nbeen employed by the Queen as her Plenipotentiary at the Court of\r\nFrance, came to Cambridge; and the next morning paid a visit to the\r\nMaster of his own College. The Master (Dr. Jenkin) loved Mr. Prior's\r\nprinciples, had a great opinion of his abilities, and a respect for his\r\ncharacter in the world; but then he had much greater respect for\r\nhimself. He knew his own dignity too well to suffer a Fellow of his\r\nCollege to sit down in his presence. He kept his seat himself, and let\r\nthe Queen's Ambassador stand. Such was the temper, not of a\r\nVice-Chancellor, but of a simple Master of a College. I remember, by the\r\nway, an extempore epigram of Matt's on the reception he had there met\r\nwith. We did not reckon in those days that he had a very happy turn for\r\nan epigram; but the occasion was tempting; and he struck it off as he\r\nwas walking from St. John's College to the Rose, where we dined\r\ntogether. It was addressed to the Master:--\r\n\r\n    \"'I _stood_, Sir, patient at your feet,\r\n      Before your elbow chair;\r\n    But make a bishop's throne your seat,\r\n      I'll _kneel_ before you there.\r\n    One only thing can keep you down,\r\n      For your great soul too mean;\r\n    You'd not, to mount a bishop's throne,\r\n      Pay _homage_ to the Queen.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n                      THE THIRD CENTURY\r\n\r\n                          1716-1815\r\n\r\n\r\nThe third century of the College history coincides roughly with the\r\neighteenth century. It was not a period of very high ideals, and\r\n\"privilege\" was in full force. For the first time in the College\r\nregisters men are entered as \"Noblemen.\" These were allowed to proceed\r\nto the M.A. degree direct in two years without passing through the\r\nintermediate stage of B.A. The College was also full of Fellow\r\nCommoners, who sat with the Fellows at the High Table in Hall; until the\r\nclose of the century these do not seem to have proceeded to any degree.\r\nThe other two classes were the pensioners, who paid their way, and the\r\nsizars. A sizar was definitely attached to a Fellow or Fellow Commoner,\r\nand in return for duties of a somewhat menial character passed through\r\nhis College course on reduced terms. Among other duties, a sizar had,\r\nwith some of the scholars, to wait at table, a service not abolished\r\nuntil 6th May 1786.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CHAPEL TOWER FROM THE RIVER.]\r\n\r\nSpeaking in general terms, the College seems gradually to have\r\nacquired the reputation of being the Tory College in the Whig\r\nUniversity; it became exceedingly fashionable, and towards the end of\r\nthe century had more students in residence than any other College. At\r\nthe same time its reputation for efficiency was very high. This was due\r\nto the policy of Dr. William Samuel Powell, Master from 1765 to 1775. He\r\nintroduced various administrative changes on the financial side of\r\nCollege management, and also started annual examinations in the College,\r\nthen a novelty in the University. These examinations were not very\r\nsevere, and to the somewhat overtaxed undergraduate of the present day\r\nmight seem almost trivial. They were not competitive, there was no order\r\nof merit, but no one seems to have been exempt; their object was simply\r\nto test the knowledge of the students. The success of the plan attracted\r\nmuch attention; it was proposed to institute similar examinations for\r\nthe University at large, but Powell opposed this on the ground that\r\ncandidates ought to be examined by those who taught them. From this date\r\nit would appear that Fellow Commoners, at St. John's at least, began to\r\ntake degrees in the University.\r\n\r\nDuring Powell's mastership an observatory was established on the top of\r\nthe western gateway of the Second Court, and regular astronomical\r\nobservations taken. Two sets of observations there made by Fellows of\r\nthe College have been published; one set made by William Ludlam in 1767\r\nand 1768, the other by Thomas Catton between 1796 and 1826, the latter\r\nbeing published by the Royal Astronomical Society in 1854.\r\n\r\nWe find members of the College taking part in all the movements of the\r\ntime. In the rebellion of 1745, James Dawson, a captain in the\r\nManchester Regiment, was taken prisoner at Carlisle, and executed in\r\nJuly 1746 on Kennington Common; while Robert Ganton, afterwards a\r\nclergyman, was excused one term's residence in the University, during\r\nwhich, as one of \"his majesty's Royal Hunters,\" he was fighting the\r\nrebels.\r\n\r\nCharles Churchill, satirist, was for a short time a member of the\r\nCollege in 1748. William Wordsworth, afterwards Poet Laureate, entered\r\nthe College as a sizar, and was admitted a foundress' scholar 6th\r\nNovember 1787. Many adopted military careers; of these we may mention\r\nGeorge, first Marquis Townshend, who joined the College in 1741,\r\nafterwards entered the army, and was present at Fontenoy and Culloden;\r\nhe went with Wolfe to Canada, and took over the command when Wolfe fell.\r\nDaniel Hoghton entered in 1787, he also became a soldier, and was one of\r\nWellington's men in the Peninsular War; he was killed at the battle of\r\nAlbuera, being then a major-general.\r\n\r\nOf another type were William Wilberforce (entered 1776) and Thomas\r\nClarkson (1779), whose names will always be associated in connection\r\nwith the abolition of slavery. The saintly Henry Martyn, Senior Wrangler\r\nin 1801 and Fellow of the College, went out as a missionary to India in\r\n1805, and died at Tokat in Persia in 1812. There have been many\r\nmissionary sons of the College since his day, but his self-denial\r\ngreatly impressed his contemporaries, and Sir James Stephen speaks of\r\nhim as \"the one heroic name which adorns the annals of the Church of\r\nEngland from the days of Elizabeth to our own.\" With Martyn curiously\r\nenough is associated in College annals another name, that of Henry John\r\nTemple, third Viscount Palmerston, sometime Prime Minister of England;\r\nfor Martyn and Temple appear as officers of the College company of\r\nvolunteers in the year 1803.\r\n\r\nThomas Denman, afterwards Lord Chief Justice, entered the College in\r\n1796; he resided in the Second Court, staircase G, at the top. When he\r\nbrought up his son, the Hon. George Denman, to Trinity he pointed the\r\nrooms out to him, and the latter pointed them out to the present writer,\r\n\"in order that the oral tradition might be preserved.\"\r\n\r\nAlexander John Scott, who, as private secretary and interpreter to Lord\r\nNelson, was present on the _Victory_ at Trafalgar, entered the College\r\nin 1786, and became a scholar of the College 3rd November 1789. Fletcher\r\nNorton, Speaker of the House of Commons from 1770 to 1780, and first\r\nLord Grantley, entered the College in 1734. With him, in a way, was\r\nconnected John Horne (afterwards Horne Tooke), who entered in 1754; for\r\nHorne, for purposes of his own, libelled Fletcher Norton when Speaker.\r\nHorne Tooke's stormy career belongs rather to political than College\r\nhistory; but it is worth noting that when he presented himself at\r\nCambridge for the M.A. degree, and the granting of this was opposed in\r\nthe senate on the ground that he had traduced the clergy in his\r\nwritings, the members of St. John's, headed by Dr. Richard Beadon, then\r\nPublic Orator, afterwards Bishop of Bath and Wells, carried the grace\r\nfor the degree. Horne and Beadon entered the College in the same year.\r\n\r\nWe have already mentioned Charles Churchill. Another Johnian poet of\r\nthis period was William Mason, who entered the College in 1742. Mason\r\nafterwards became a Fellow of Pembroke, where he was the intimate friend\r\nof Thomas Gray. As the biographer of Gray he is perhaps better\r\nremembered than for his own poetry, though during his lifetime he\r\nenjoyed considerable fame.\r\n\r\nA somewhat unusual career was that of William Smith, who entered the\r\nCollege from Eton in 1747, but left without taking a degree. He is\r\nreported to have snapped an unloaded pistol at one of the Proctors, and\r\nrather than submit to the punishment which the College authorities\r\nthought proper to inflict, left the University. He became an actor, and\r\nwas very popular in his day, being known as \"Gentleman Smith.\" He was\r\nassociated with David Garrick, and Smith's admirers held that he fell\r\nlittle short of his master in the art.\r\n\r\nThe reputation of the College as a medical school was maintained by Dr.\r\nWilliam Heberden, who entered in 1724. Heberden attended Samuel Johnson\r\nin his last illness, and Johnson described him as \"_ultimus Romanorum_,\r\nthe last of our learned physicians.\" A description which may be\r\namplified by saying that Heberden was in a way the first of the modern\r\nphysicians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n                     THE CURRENT CENTURY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe time has probably not yet come when a satisfactory account of\r\nCollege and University development during the nineteenth century can be\r\nwritten. The changes have been fundamental, involving perhaps a change\r\nof ideal as well as of method. In early days the College was filled with\r\nmen saturated with the spirit of the Renaissance; casting aside the\r\nstudies of the Middle Ages, they returned to the literature of Greece\r\nand Rome. The ideals of the present day are not less high, but more\r\ncomplex and less easy to state briefly; the aim is perhaps rather to add\r\nto knowledge than to acquire it for its own sake alone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The College Chapel]\r\n\r\nFor the first half of the century College life was still regulated by\r\nthe statutes of Elizabeth. These were characterised by over-cautious and\r\nminute legislation. Now that they are superseded, the chief feeling is\r\none of surprise that a system of laws, intended to be unchangeable,\r\nshould have endured so long in presence of the changing character of the\r\nwants and habits of mankind.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that each member of the corporate body, Master,\r\nFellow, or Scholar, on admission, each officer on his appointment, bound\r\nhimself by oaths of great solemnity to observe these statutes and to\r\nseek no dispensation from their provisions. To a more logical race the\r\ndifficulties must have proved intolerable--the practical Englishman\r\nfound his own solution.\r\n\r\nThe forms were observed _juramenti gratia_, but much practical work was\r\nsupplemental to the statutes. This could be illustrated in more than one\r\nway--the most interesting is the development of the educational side and\r\nthe tutorial system.\r\n\r\nThe statutes prescribed the appointment of certain lecturers--even the\r\nsubjects of their lectures. Space need not be occupied in showing that\r\nsuch provisions soon became obsolete. The working solution was found in\r\nthe tutorial system. In early days it was contemplated and prescribed\r\nthat each Fellow should have the care of two or three students, living\r\nwith them, teaching them daily; the exact date when this system passed\r\naway has not been traced with any certainty, but gradually the number of\r\nFellows taking individual charge of the undergraduates diminished until\r\nit became reduced to two or three. Those in charge became known as\r\nTutors, and with each Tutor was associated one or two others called\r\nAssistant Tutors or Lecturers. A charge was made to the undergraduates\r\nfor tuition, and the sum so received was shared by the Tutors and their\r\nassistants. But the Tutor was not a College officer in the eye of the\r\nstatutes, nor the money received for tuition treated as part of the\r\nCollege revenues. The system worked, because it was meant to work, and\r\nas it was not subject to obsolete rules could be modified and adapted to\r\nchanging conditions. So long as the chief subjects of study were few in\r\nnumber, practically restricted to classics and mathematics, College\r\nprovision for teaching was possible and simple. The multiplication of\r\nstudies, the needs of the studies generally known as the Natural\r\nSciences, with their expensive laboratories and equipment, are entailing\r\nfurther changes, and the tendency, more especially in the newer\r\nsubjects, is to centralise teaching under the control of University\r\nprofessors and teachers. The subject is one of great interest, but\r\ncannot be further touched upon here. To return to the history of St.\r\nJohn's.\r\n\r\nDr. James Wood became Master in 1815. He was a man of humble origin, a\r\nnative of Holcombe, in the parish of Bury, Lancashire. According to a\r\nwell-authenticated tradition he \"kept,\" as an undergraduate, in a garret\r\nin staircase O in the Second Court, and studied in the evening by the\r\nlight of the rush candle which lit the staircase, with his feet in\r\nstraw, not being able to afford fire or light. He became a successful\r\nand popular College Tutor, and his mathematical writings were long the\r\nstandard text-books in the University. At the time of his death in 1839\r\nhe held, with his mastership, the Deanery of Ely and the Rectory of\r\nFreshwater in the Isle of Wight. He made the College his residuary\r\nlegatee, but during his life had handed over large sums for College\r\npurposes, and the total of his gifts cannot have been less than L60,000.\r\n\r\nIn Wood's time we find the first movement in favour of change taken by\r\nthe College itself. St. John's then suffered under a specially awkward\r\nrestriction arising from the joint effect of the general statutes and\r\nthe trusts of private foundations. By the statutes not more than two\r\nFellows could come from any one county in England, or more than one from\r\neach diocese in Wales.\r\n\r\nThere were thirty-two foundation Fellows, and twenty-one founded by\r\nprivate benefactors, the latter having all the privileges and advantages\r\nof the former. Each of these private foundations had its own special\r\nrestriction; the holders were to be perhaps of founder's name or kin, or\r\nto come from certain specified counties, parishes, or schools. The\r\neffect of these special restrictions was that many fellowships had to be\r\nfilled by men possessing the special qualification without, perhaps, any\r\ngreat intellectual distinction. But once a county was \"full\" no Fellow\r\ncould be elected who had been born in that county; and even if a vacancy\r\noccurred a promising man might be again cut out by some special\r\nrestriction. Dr. Wood and the Fellows addressed themselves to this point\r\nand obtained in 1820 the Royal consent to a statute throwing open the\r\nfoundress' fellowships without restriction as to county; the private\r\nfoundations were left untouched, but the College was empowered to\r\ntransfer a Fellow on the foundress' foundation to one of the special\r\nfoundations, if qualified.\r\n\r\nDr. Wood was succeeded as Master by Dr. Ralph Tatham, whose father and\r\ngrandfather (of the same names) had been members of the College. He was\r\nPublic Orator of the University from 1809 to 1836, an office for which\r\nhe was well qualified by a singular dignity of person and courtesy of\r\nmanner. \"He brought forth butter,\" said the wags, \"in a lordly dish.\" In\r\nthe year 1837 the Earl of Radnor and others raised the question of\r\nUniversity reform, and tried to induce the House of Lords to pass a bill\r\nfor the appointment of a University Commission. In the end the matter\r\nwas shelved, the friends of the University undertaking that the\r\nColleges, with the approval of their Visitors, should prepare new\r\nstatutes for the assent of the Crown. The change in St. John's was\r\nopposed by some ultra-conservative Fellows, who urged that as they were\r\nbound by oath to observe and uphold the statutes, and to seek no\r\ndispensation from them, they were precluded from asking for any change.\r\nThe Bishop of Ely, however, gently put this objection on one side, and\r\nthe statutes then prepared were approved by Queen Victoria in 1849. The\r\nmore ardent reformers have described this code as merely legalising the\r\ncustoms and \"abuses\" which had grown up around the Elizabethan statutes\r\nwithout introducing any effective change.\r\n\r\nOn the death of Dr. Tatham (19th January 1857), Dr. William Henry\r\nBateson was elected Master; he had been Senior Bursar of the College\r\nfrom 1846, and Public Orator of the University from 1848. Dr. Bateson\r\nwas a man of scholarly tastes, but he was above all a practical man of\r\naffairs and of broad views. He served on more than one University\r\nCommission appointed to examine into and report upon the University and\r\nColleges. The College statutes were twice revised during his mastership;\r\nthe first code becoming law in 1860, the second was prepared during his\r\nlifetime, though it did not become law till a year after his death.\r\nThese statutes are much less interesting reading than the early\r\nstatutes, though undoubtedly more useful. While aiming at precision in\r\nthe matter of rights and duties, they leave great freedom in matters of\r\nstudy, discipline, and administration. All local restrictions on\r\nscholarships and fellowships have been abolished. The government of the\r\nCollege is entrusted to a Council of twelve, elected by the Fellows,\r\nand presided over by the Master; a simple method has been provided of\r\naltering them if necessary. Independently of the changes thus introduced\r\nthe College, on its own initiative, was providing for the newer studies.\r\nIn 1853 a chemical laboratory was built, and a lecturer in chemistry\r\nappointed, and other lecturers appointed from time to time as the scope\r\nof University teaching was widened. St. John's at an early date began to\r\nelect men to scholarships and fellowships for Natural Science. In all\r\nthis we may trace the influence of Dr. Bateson, one of whose guiding\r\nprinciples was to widen and increase the teaching power of the College,\r\nand to reward intellectual distinction of any kind. Dr. Bateson died\r\n27th March 1881, and was succeeded by Dr. Charles Taylor, the present\r\nMaster.\r\n\r\nOf men who have added lustre to the College roll of worthies we may\r\nmention Sir John F. W. Herschel, the astronomer, who was Senior Wrangler\r\nin 1813, and died in 1871, laden with all the honours which scientific\r\nand learned bodies could bestow upon him; he lies buried in Westminster\r\nAbbey close to the tomb of Newton. John Couch Adams, Senior Wrangler in\r\n1843, in July 1841, while yet an undergraduate, resolved to investigate\r\nthe irregularities in the motion of the planet Uranus, with the view of\r\ndetermining whether they might be attributed to an undiscovered planet.\r\nThe memorandum he made of his resolve is, as has been stated, now in\r\nthe College Library. It is a matter of history how Adams carried out his\r\npurpose, and how through a series of unlucky accidents he did not get\r\nthe sole credit for his discovery of the planet Neptune. Adams became a\r\nFellow of the College in 1843, but had to vacate his fellowship in 1852\r\nas he was not in orders. The College tried to induce a Mr. Blakeney, who\r\nthen held one of the very few fellowships tenable by a layman, to resign\r\nhis fellowship and make way for Adams; offering to pay him for the rest\r\nof his life an income equal to that of his fellowship. Mr. Blakeney,\r\nhowever, refused, and a fellowship was found for Mr. Adams at Pembroke\r\nCollege, which he held till his death.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps a delicate matter to allude to those still living, but two\r\nmay perhaps be mentioned. The Hon. Charles A. Parsons by his development\r\nof the steam turbine has revolutionised certain departments of\r\nengineering. Dairoku Kikuchi, the first Japanese student to come to\r\nCambridge, after graduating in 1877, in the same year as Mr. Parsons,\r\nreturned to Japan, and has held many offices, including that of Minister\r\nof Education, in his native country.\r\n\r\nWe may say that the changes introduced in the nineteenth century have\r\nrestored to the College its national character, admitting to the full\r\nprivileges of a University career certain classes of students who had\r\nbeen gradually excluded. During the reigns of Henry VIII., Edward VI.,\r\nMary, and Elizabeth, there was always a part of the nation, Protestant\r\nor Roman Catholic, which found the entry barred to it. The establishment\r\nof the Anglican rule in the reign of Elizabeth led to the exclusion of\r\nRoman Catholics, and for three hundred years the doors of the University\r\nwere closed to them.\r\n\r\nThe Civil Wars, the Commonwealth, and the Restoration produced religious\r\ndifficulties of another kind; the wholesale ejections in 1644 and 1660\r\ntestify to the troubles men had to face for conscience' sake. After the\r\nRestoration the Puritan, the Protestant Dissenter, was excluded with the\r\nRomanist.\r\n\r\nIn the eighteenth century a certain variety was introduced by the entry\r\nof students from the West Indies, sons of planters; one or two\r\nindividuals came from the American colonies. The constant wars drew off\r\nmen to military careers, and the religious movements towards the close\r\nof the century attracted men, after leaving College, to Unitarianism or\r\nWesleyanism. The celebrated Rowland Hill was a member of the College;\r\nFrancis Okeley, after leaving, became a Moravian or a Mystic. Such\r\ndissenters as entered the College, and they were very few, were obliged\r\nto leave without graduating.\r\n\r\nThe removal of all religious tests has thus restored to the ancient\r\nUniversities a national character they had not possessed since the early\r\ndays of Henry VIII., when all could come, as all were practically of the\r\nsame faith.\r\n\r\nThus a wider field is open to the College to draw on, not only in the\r\nBritish Islands, but in all its colonies and dependencies. On the other\r\nhand, it is no less true that her sons are to be found more widely\r\nscattered. A hundred and fifty years ago one could say of a selected\r\ngroup of men that the majority would become clergymen or schoolmasters,\r\na few would become barristers, others would return to their country\r\nestates, one or two might enter the army; with that we should have\r\nexhausted the probabilities. Now there is probably not a career open to\r\neducated men in which members of the College are not to be found; the\r\nState in every department, civil, ecclesiastical, or military, enlists\r\nher sons in its service. The rise of scientific industries has opened\r\nnew careers to trained men. We talk of the spacious days of Elizabeth;\r\nif space itself has not increased it is at least more permeated with men\r\nwho owe their early training to the foundation of the Lady Margaret.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n                        SOCIAL LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nHitherto we have confined ourselves to an outline of the College history\r\non what may be called its official side. In what follows we deal briefly\r\nwith some features of the life of the place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NEW COURT]\r\n\r\nThe original, and perhaps the chief, purpose of the College in the eyes\r\nof those who founded it was practically that it should form a training\r\nground for the clergy. The statutes of King Henry VIII. distinctly lay\r\ndown that theology is the goal to which philosophy and all other studies\r\nlead, and that none were to be elected Fellows who did not propose to\r\nstudy theology. The statutes of Elizabeth provided a certain elasticity\r\nby prescribing that those Fellows who did not enter priests' orders\r\nwithin six years should vacate their fellowships; but that two Fellows\r\nmight be allowed, by the Master and a majority of the Senior Fellows, to\r\ndevote themselves to the study of medicine. King Charles I. in 1635\r\nallowed a like privilege to be granted from thenceforth to two Fellows\r\nwho were to study law. These privileges were not always popular, and we\r\noccasionally find the clerical Fellows complaining that while the\r\nduties of teaching and catechising were laid on them, a man who had held\r\none of the law or medical fellowships sometimes took orders late in life\r\nand then claimed presentation to a College benefice in virtue of his\r\nseniority as a Fellow, having in the meantime escaped the drudgery to\r\nwhich the Fellow in orders had been subject.\r\n\r\nThe emoluments of members of the Society in early times were very\r\nmodest, and as prices rose became quite inadequate; the amounts being\r\nnamed in the College statutes were incapable of alteration, and indirect\r\nmeans were taken to provide relief. In Bishop Fisher's time it was\r\nconsidered that an endowment of L6 a year sufficed to found a\r\nfellowship, and L3 a year to found a scholarship. The statutable stipend\r\nof the Master was only L12 a year, though he had some other allowances,\r\nthe total amount of which was equally trivial. James Pilkington, Master\r\nfrom 1559 to 1561, when he became Bishop of Durham, wrote to Lord\r\nBurghley on the subject of his successor, stating that whoever became\r\nMaster must have some benefice besides to enable him to live. Richard\r\nLongworth, Master from 1564 to 1569, made a similar complaint, putting\r\nthe weekly expenses of his office at L3. We accordingly find that many\r\nof the Masters held country benefices, prebends, or deaneries with their\r\nCollege office. Lord Keeper Williams, who gave to the College the\r\nadvowsons of Soulderne in Oxfordshire, Freshwater in the Isle of Wight,\r\nand the sinecure rectories of St. Florence and Aberdaron in Wales, made\r\nit part of the conditions of his gift that the Master should always be\r\nentitled to take one of these livings if a vacancy occurred. Many of the\r\nFellows also held benefices or curacies near Cambridge. In the\r\neighteenth century the business of holding ecclesiastical preferment in\r\nplurality became almost a fine art; thus Sir Isaac Pennington, who was\r\nPresident of the College and Regius Professor of Physic, left to the\r\nCollege by his will a fund to provide the sum of L200 a year for the\r\nMaster \"if he be rector of Freshwater and not otherwise,\" a direct and\r\ncurious incentive to holding in plurality. A Fellow was entitled to his\r\ncommons, and, in addition, to allowances of 13s. 4d. under each of the\r\nthree heads of \"corn,\" \"livery,\" and \"stipend,\" or, as we may say, food,\r\nclothes, and pocket-money. The College officers received but small\r\nsalaries, the most highly paid being the President and Senior Bursar,\r\nwho each received L2.\r\n\r\nAn effort was made by the Statutes of the Realm to improve the condition\r\nof members of colleges. It seems to have been assumed that the rent of a\r\ncollege farm, like its statutes, could not be altered; but by an Act of\r\nParliament passed in the eighteenth year of Elizabeth, known as Sir\r\nThomas Smith's Act, it was enacted that from thenceforth one-third of\r\nthe rents were to be paid in wheat and malt; the price of wheat for the\r\npurposes of the Act being assumed to be 6s. 8d. a quarter, and of malt\r\n5s. a quarter. Thus if before the Act the rent of a farm was L6 a year,\r\nafter it became law the tenant had to pay L4 in money, three-quarters of\r\nwheat, and four quarters of malt, these two latter items coming to L1\r\neach. But the tenant now paid a rent varying according to the prices of\r\nthe day--namely, the money rent plus the cash value of the wheat and\r\nmalt according to the best prices of these commodities in Cambridge on\r\nthe market-day preceding quarter-day. Thus as the prices of wheat and\r\nmalt rose the College benefited. By the Act this variable one-third, or\r\n\"corn-money,\" went to increase the allowance for commons. As time went\r\non the amount of the corn-money was more than sufficient to pay for the\r\ncommons, and a further modest allowance out of the surplus was made to\r\nall who participated in the College revenues, whether as Master, Fellow,\r\nscholar, or sizar, under the name of _praeter_.\r\n\r\nIn process of time another source of revenue arose. Leases of College\r\nestates were usually granted for a term of forty years, and there was a\r\ngeneral custom that the tenant might surrender his lease at the end of\r\nfourteen years and receive a new one for forty years. As prices rose\r\ntenants were willing to pay a consideration for the renewal known as a\r\n\"fine\"--this was calculated on the full letting value of the estate at\r\nthe time of the renewal, the rent reserved remaining at its traditional\r\namount. At first this fine-money was regarded as a species of surplus,\r\nand grants were made from it to Fellows or scholars who were ill or in\r\nspecial need of temporary assistance. The cost of entertaining royalties\r\nor other distinguished visitors, and part of the cost of new buildings,\r\nwere defrayed from this source. In the year 1629 the practice arose of\r\ndividing this fine-money up among the Master and Fellows in certain\r\nshares, and the money so paid became known as the \"dividend.\" At the\r\npresent time the College property is managed like any other landed\r\nestate, and after the necessary expenses of management and maintenance\r\nhave been met, and certain fixed sums paid to the scholars and\r\nexhibitioners, and to the University, the remainder is by the statutes\r\ndivided up into shares called dividends, each Fellow getting one\r\ndividend, the Master and the members of the College Council receiving\r\ncertain additions calculated in dividends; there is a general\r\nrestriction that the dividend shall not exceed L250 a year. The fall in\r\nthe value of land at present automatically provides that this limit is\r\nnot exceeded; if the revenues become more than sufficient for the\r\npurpose, additional fellowships and scholarships must be established.\r\n\r\nThe reader will gather that the chief endowment of the College arises\r\nfrom land. The College estates lie scattered over most of the eastern\r\nside of England, from Yorkshire to Kent. There is no large block of\r\nproperty anywhere. The estates in past times, when means of\r\ncommunication were poor, must have been difficult to visit. In the\r\nleases of the more distant farms it was usual to stipulate that the\r\ntenant should provide \"horse meat and man's meat\" for the Master and\r\nBursar and their servants while on a tour of inspection. That some care\r\nwas bestowed on the management is clear from the regular entries, in the\r\nbooks of accounts, of the expenses of those \"riding on College\r\nbusiness.\" Probably the estates were visited when leases came to be\r\nrenewed, and an effort made to discover the actual letting value of the\r\nproperty. Land agents seem to have been first employed to make formal\r\nvaluations towards the end of the eighteenth century, and about the same\r\ntime plans of the estates were obtained, some of these, made before the\r\nenclosures, showing the land scattered in many minute pieces, are very\r\ncurious and interesting.\r\n\r\nThe actual life within the College walls is not so easy to describe with\r\nany certainty. At first, as we have seen, the undergraduates actually\r\nlived with Fellows of the College, and overcrowding must have been a\r\nconstant feature of College life. On 15th December 1565 a return was\r\nmade to Lord Burghley of all students, \"whether tutors or pupils,\"\r\nresiding in the College, with notes as to whether they had come into\r\nChapel in their surplices or not. The return concludes with this\r\nsummary: \"The whole number is 287, whereof there came into the Chappell\r\nwith surplesses upon the last Saturdaie and Sondaie 147; and abrode in\r\nthe country 33. And of thother 107 whiche cumme not in as yet, there be\r\nmany cumme to the Colledge of late and be not yet provided of\r\nsurplesses.\" At this time we have to remember that the buildings of the\r\nCollege consisted only of the First Court, the Infirmary or Labyrinth,\r\nand a small block of buildings in a corner of the ground now occupied by\r\nthe Second Court, swept away when that was built. The arrangement seems\r\nto have been as follows. The ground-floor rooms were occupied by junior\r\nFellows, each with a few pupils. The rooms on the first floor, known in\r\nthe College books as the \"middle chambers,\" were in greater request;\r\nwith these went the rooms on the second floor, with sometimes _excelses_\r\nor garrets over them--these could accommodate a senior Fellow with\r\nseveral pupils. In the older parts of the College the rooms occupied the\r\nwhole depth of the building, and so were lighted from both sides; in the\r\ncorners, when light could be obtained, cubicles or studies were\r\npartitioned off. From a sanitary point of view, life under such\r\nconditions must have left much to be desired, and the burial registers\r\nof All Saints' parish (in which the older part of the College is\r\nsituated) leave the impression of frequent and almost epidemic illness\r\nin the College during the sixteenth and early part of the seventeenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThe undergraduates in early times were much younger than the men of the\r\npresent day. The statutes prescribed that the oath should not be\r\nrequired from scholars who were under sixteen years of age; the frequent\r\noccurrence of _non juratus_ in the admission entry of a scholar shows\r\nthat many came to the College before that age. Probably the average age\r\nwas about sixteen; the idea being that after the seven years' residence\r\nrequired for the M.A. degree they would be of the proper age to present\r\nthemselves for ordination. Those under eighteen years of age might be\r\npublicly whipped in the Hall for breaches of discipline.\r\n\r\nStudents from distant parts of England probably resided continuously in\r\nCollege from the time they entered it until they took their degrees. The\r\nstatutes of King Henry VIII. contemplate a period of some relaxation at\r\nChristmas; providing that each Fellow in turn should be \"Lord\" at\r\nChristmas, and prepare dialogues and plays to be acted by members of the\r\nCollege between Epiphany and Lent. The brazier in the Hall seems to have\r\nbeen kept burning in the evening about Christmas time; of this practice\r\na curious relic survived until comparatively lately, it being the custom\r\nto leave a few gas-jets burning in the Hall until midnight from St.\r\nJohn's Day (December 27) until Twelfth Night.\r\n\r\nThere were three classes of students. The Fellow Commoners, sons of\r\nnoblemen or wealthy land-owners, who sat at the High Table, or, as it\r\nwas phrased, were in Fellows' commons. Some came in considerable state.\r\nIn 1624 the Earl of Arundel and Surrey sent his two sons, Lord\r\nMaltravers and Mr. William Howard, to the College. The Earl's chaplain,\r\nor secretary, in making arrangements for their coming, wrote to request\r\nthat they should have one chamber in the College, with a \"pallett for\r\nthe gromes of their chamber\"; the rest of \"his lordships company, being\r\ntwo gentlemen, a grome of his stable and a footman, may be lodged in the\r\ntowne near the College.\" At this period the Second Court had been built,\r\nand the accommodation for residence thus somewhat greater than in\r\nElizabethan times. The Fellow Commoner wore a gown ornamented with gold\r\nlace, and a cap with a gold tassel. The last Fellow Commoner at St.\r\nJohn's to wear this dress was the present Admiral Sir Wilmot Hawksworth\r\nFawkes.\r\n\r\nThe next class in order of status were the Pensioners--men who paid\r\ntheir expenses without assistance from the College, sons of middle-class\r\nparents. In times of which we have any definite record this was the most\r\nnumerous class in College. Lastly, we have the sizars. A sizar was\r\ndefinitely attached to a Fellow or Fellow Commoner; he was not exactly a\r\nservant, but made himself generally useful. For example, those members\r\nof the College who absented themselves from the University sermon were\r\nin the eighteenth century fined sixpence, and the sizars were expected\r\nto mark the absentees. The sizar at Cambridge had, however, always a\r\nbetter status than the servitor at Oxford, and in the days when\r\nscholarships were strictly limited as to locality, a sizarship was\r\nsomething of the nature of what at the present day we should describe as\r\nan entrance scholarship or exhibition, the assistance given consisting\r\nin a reduction of expenses rather than in actual direct emolument. At\r\nthe present time there is no difference in status among members of the\r\nCollege; the foundation scholars, however, having special seats in\r\nChapel and a separate table in Hall if they choose to make use of it.\r\n\r\nUntil 1882 the condition of celibacy attached to all fellowships in the\r\nCollege; Queen Elizabeth held strong views on the matter, even\r\ndiscouraging the marriage of Masters. The necessity of taking orders was\r\nsomewhat relaxed in 1860. The system had its advantages--it tended to\r\nproduce promotion; for the natural inclination of mankind to marry,\r\nvacated fellowships; the disadvantage was that men with a real taste for\r\nstudy or teaching had no certain career before them. The question of\r\nallowing Fellows to marry was raised in the eighteenth century, but met\r\nwith little support and much opposition. Even in the middle of the\r\nnineteenth century a University Commission inclined to the view that\r\ncelibacy was inseparable from the collegiate system.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE \"BRIDGE OF SIGHS\"]\r\n\r\nThe clerical restriction had the effect of chiefly confining selection\r\nto College offices to those who were in orders. These in due course\r\nwent off to benefices in the gift of the College, these acting as a\r\nspecies of pension. One form of benefaction frequently bestowed by past\r\nmembers was the gift of an advowson; one or two benefactors left\r\nestates, the revenues from which were to accumulate, and with the sums\r\nso raised advowsons were to be purchased. Presentation to livings went\r\nby seniority of standing, and this practice, with the restriction on\r\nmarriage, gave rise to the belief, still prevalent in many parishes\r\nwhere the College is patron, that the College on a vacancy always\r\nchooses for the next incumbent \"the oldest bachelor.\" It seems probable,\r\nwithout any minute statistical inquiry, that most of the Fellows left\r\nthe College before the age of forty. A few remained on for life.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult now to reconstruct a picture of the High Table, made up\r\nas it was for many years of a group of middle-aged or elderly men, with\r\na considerable admixture of youthful Fellow Commoners. During the\r\neighteenth century the proportion of Fellow Commoners was probably from\r\none-fourth to one-third of those dining together, and constraint on both\r\nsides must have been almost inevitable. The terms \"don\" and\r\n\"donnishness\" seem to have acquired their uncomplimentary meaning about\r\nthis period. The precise significance of \"don\" is not easy to express\r\nconcisely; the most felicitous is perhaps that of the Oxford _Shotover\r\nPapers_, where we read that don means, in Spain, a gentleman; in\r\nEngland, a Fellow. The abolition of the Fellow Commoner was perhaps\r\nchiefly due to the rise of the democratic spirit and a general dislike\r\nof privilege, but there are other grounds for welcoming it.\r\n\r\nOf the individuals who make up the stream of youthful life which has\r\nebbed and flowed through the College gate there is but little official\r\nrecord. An Admonition Book exists, in which more than a century ago\r\nthose who were punished for graver offences against discipline signed\r\nthe record of their sentence and promised amendment. One youth admits\r\nover a trembling signature that he was \"admonished by the Master, before\r\nthe Seniors, for keeping strangers in my chamber till twelve o' the\r\nclock, and disturbing the Master by knocking at his gate in an\r\nirreverent manner at that hour for the keys of the gate.\" When the\r\nCollege gate was closed it may be explained that the keys were placed in\r\nthe Master's keeping. We are, however, left in ignorance of what passed\r\nin that chamber until the midnight hour. Yet no doubt the student in\r\npast days had his amusements as well as his successor of the present\r\nday--rougher perhaps, but not less agreeable to him.\r\n\r\nIn Bishop Fisher's statutes archery was encouraged as a pastime, and we\r\nknow from Ascham's writings that he indulged in it. In the sixteenth\r\ncentury the College built a tennis-court for the use of its members.\r\nJohn Hall, who entered the College in 1646, recommended \"shittlecock\" as\r\nfit for students--\"it requires a nimble arme with quick and waking eye.\"\r\nWe hear of horse matches and cock-fighting, but in terms of disapproval.\r\nFootball is mentioned in 1574, when the Vice-Chancellor directed that\r\nscholars should only play upon their own College ground. In 1595 \"the\r\nhurtful and unscholarly exercise of football\" was forbidden, except\r\nwithin each College and between members of the same College. Certain\r\ngeneral orders for the discipline of the undergraduates, which gave rise\r\nto much controversy about 1750, forbade cricket between the hours of\r\nnine and twelve in the morning. In 1763 the Vice-Chancellor required\r\nthat no scholar, of whatever rank, should be present at bull-baiting. We\r\nread in the eighteenth century of \"schemes\" or water-parties on the\r\nriver, but these appear to have been more of the nature of picnics than\r\nexercises of skill. Riding was probably very common, the student\r\narriving on his nag, perhaps selling it and using the proceeds as a\r\nstart in his new life. The phrase \"Hobson's choice\" took its rise from\r\nthe rule in the livery stables of Hobson the carrier that a man who\r\nhired a hack had to take the one that stood nearest to the stable door.\r\nIn later days stage-coaches supplied a more regular means of\r\nconveyance. Students leaving Cambridge for the North betook themselves\r\nto Huntingdon, and were housed at the George Inn there till places could\r\nbe found for them in the coaches. The landlord of the George sending\r\nover to Cambridge to let it be known that one batch were gone and that\r\nanother might come over.\r\n\r\nTraditions linger in parishes round Cambridge that the University\r\n\"gentlemen\" used certain fields or commons for the purpose of riding\r\nraces; the Cottenham steeplechases are presumably a survival of this\r\npractice. Shooting and coursing, with a little hunting, came into vogue\r\nat the end of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe rise and organisation of athletic sports as an essential element of\r\nCollege life would require a bulky history in itself. The first to take\r\ndefinite form was rowing. The historic boat club of the college is the\r\nLady Margaret Boat Club; this was founded in the October term of 1825.\r\nThe actual founder of the club seems to have been the Hon. Richard John\r\nLe Poer Trench, a son of the second Earl of Clancarty. Trench afterwards\r\nbecame a captain in the 52nd Regiment, and died 12th August 1841. The\r\nclub was the first to start an eight-oared boat on the Cam, though some\r\nTrinity men had a four-oar on the river a short time before the Lady\r\nMargaret was started. Among the first members of the club were William\r\nSnow and Charles Merivale, afterwards Dean of Ely. Trench acted as\r\nstroke of the original first boat crew in the Lent Term of 1826. There\r\nwere at first no regular races, but impromptu trials of speed with other\r\ncrews frequently took place. In 1827 the University Boat Club was\r\nstarted, and regular bumping races begun. The first challenge to Oxford\r\nwas determined on at a meeting of the University Boat Club held 20th\r\nFebruary 1829, when it was resolved: \"That Mr. Snow, of St. John's, be\r\nrequested to write immediately to Mr. Staniforth, Christ Church, Oxford,\r\nproposing to make up a University Match.\" The match was made up, and the\r\nrace rowed at Henley on 10th June 1829, and from this the annual\r\nboat-race between Oxford and Cambridge takes its rise. Snow acted as\r\nstroke of the Cambridge boat, George Augustus Selwyn, successively\r\nBishop of New Zealand and Lichfield, rowed \"seven,\" and Charles Merivale\r\n\"four.\" Snow (afterwards Strahan) became a banker, and died at Florence\r\n4th July 1886. In after years when, from 1861 to 1869 inclusive, Oxford\r\nhad uniformly beaten Cambridge, the Lady Margaret supplied the late John\r\nH. D. Goldie to break the spell and restore hope and confidence to\r\nCambridge crews. Thus the College club has taken an important part in\r\nthe establishment and maintenance of Cambridge rowing. Two verses of the\r\nCollege boat song run as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"Mater regum Margareta\r\n    Piscatori dixit laeta\r\n      'Audi quod propositum;\r\n    Est remigium decorum\r\n    Suavis strepitus remorum\r\n      Ergo sit Collegium.'\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Sic Collegium fundatum\r\n    Et Johannis nomen datum\r\n      Margareta domina,\r\n    Ergo remiges gaudendum\r\n    Triumphandum et canendum\r\n      In saeclorum secula.\"\r\n\r\nSo that, if we can trust the historic insight of the author (Mr. T. R.\r\nGlover), the intentions of the foundress have been duly carried out.\r\n\r\nThe uniform of the club was at first much what it is now, a white jersey\r\nwith pink stripes; with this was worn a jacket of scarlet flannel,\r\npopularly known as a \"blazer\"--a name which has passed into the English\r\nlanguage as descriptive of the coloured jackets of all clubs. It is said\r\nthat some one, whose feeling for analogy was stronger than for decorum,\r\ndescribed the surplice as \"the blazer of the Church of England.\"\r\nOrganised cricket clubs, athletic clubs, and football clubs grew up, and\r\nin process of time clubs for the pursuit of every kind of athletic\r\nexercise have been started. Originally each club in College had a\r\nsubscription, paid by its members, towards the expenses of the special\r\ngame. About twenty years ago all the clubs in St. John's were united\r\ninto one club--\"The Amalgamation.\" The subscription to this entitles a\r\nmember to join in any of the recognised games. The funds are\r\nadministered by a committee consisting of the representatives of those\r\ninterested in the different games, and grants made from the general fund\r\ntowards the expenses of each game. The presence of a few senior members\r\nof the College on the committee provides the continuity so difficult to\r\nmaintain with the short-lived generations of undergraduate life. The\r\nCollege provides the ground for the cricket, football, and lawn-tennis\r\nclubs, while through the generosity of members of the College of all\r\nstandings a handsome boat-house has recently been built on the river.\r\nThe College also possesses flourishing musical and debating societies,\r\nand from time to time clubs arise for literary and social purposes,\r\ndying out and being refounded with great persistence.\r\n\r\nIn another sphere of work the College has taken a leading part. St.\r\nJohn's was the first College in Cambridge to start a mission in\r\nLondon--the Lady Margaret Mission in Walworth. Preaching in the College\r\nChapel on 28th January 1883, the Rev. William Allen Whitworth, a Fellow\r\nof the College, then Vicar of St. John's, Hammersmith, afterwards\r\nIncumbent of All Saints', Margaret Street, suggested that the College\r\nshould support a mission in some neglected district of London. The\r\nmatter took form a little later in the year, and since then the College\r\nMission has been a College institution. Members of the College visiting\r\nthe mission district, and visitors from Walworth coming for an annual\r\nouting, including a cricket match, in August.\r\n\r\nAnother flourishing institution is the College magazine, _The Eagle_.\r\nFounded in the year 1858, it has maintained its existence for nearly\r\nfifty years, being now the oldest of College magazines. It has numbered\r\namong its contributors many who have subsequently found a wider field\r\nand audience: some of the earliest efforts of Samuel Butler, author of\r\n_Erewhon_, are to be found in its pages.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI now bring my sketch of the College history to a close. I have\r\nendeavoured, within the prescribed limits, to give an outline of the\r\ncorporate life of an ancient and famous foundation. In writing it two\r\nclasses of readers have been borne in mind: the visitor who, within a\r\nshort compass, may wish to learn something more than can be picked up by\r\nan inspection of the buildings; members of the College who feel a lively\r\ninterest in the habits and pursuits of those who have preceded them. I\r\nhave, perhaps, thought more of the latter than of the former class.\r\n\r\nMembers of the College have always been distinguished for a certain\r\nindependence of thought and adherence to principle, not always guided\r\nby motives of mere worldly prudence; they have always been noted for\r\nthat strong corporate feeling which finds expression in the words of\r\nViscount Falkland's letter, before alluded to: \"I still carry about with\r\nme an indelible character of affection and duty to that Society, and an\r\nextraordinary longing for some occasion of expressing that affection and\r\nthat duty.\"\r\n\r\nTo one who has spent much of his life in the service of the institution\r\nto which he owes so much, the words of the Psalmist (a Scot naturally\r\nquotes the version endeared to him by early association) seem to put the\r\nmatter concisely--\r\n\r\n    \"For in her rubbish and her stones\r\n      thy servants pleasure take;\r\n    Yea, they the very dust thereof\r\n      do favour for her sake.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nAdams, J.
