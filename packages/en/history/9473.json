HARRIS, LL.D.\r\n\r\nCommissioner of Education\r\n\r\nMy Dear Doctor:--\r\n\r\nThis translation, of one of the greatest novels of Poland's foremost\r\nmodern writer, Henryk Sienkiewicz, I beg to dedicate to you. Apart for my\r\nhigh personal regard for you, my reason for selecting you among all my\r\nliterary friends, is: that you are a historian and philosopher, and can\r\ntherefore best appreciate works of this kind.\r\n\r\nSAMUEL A. BINION,\r\n\r\nNew York City.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the Reader.\r\n\r\nHere you have, gentle reader--old writers always called you\r\ngentle--something very much more than a novel to amuse an idle hour. To\r\nread it will be enjoyable pastime, no doubt; but the brilliant romance of\r\nthe brilliant author calls upon you for some exercise of the finest\r\nsympathy and intelligence; sympathy for a glorious nation which, with\r\nonly one exception, has suffered beyond all other nations; intelligence,\r\nof the sources of that unspeakable and immeasurable love and of the great\r\nthings that may yet befall before those woes are atoned for and due\r\npunishment for them meted out to their guilty authors.\r\n\r\nPoland! Poland! The very name carries with it sighings and groanings,\r\nnation-murder, brilliance, beauty, patriotism, splendors, self-sacrifice\r\nthrough generations of gallant men and exquisite women; indomitable\r\nendurance of bands of noble people carrying through world-wide exile the\r\nsacred fire of wrath against the oppressor, and uttering in every clime a\r\ncry of appeal to Humanity to rescue Poland.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed a terrible moment in history, when the three military\r\nmonarchies of Europe, Russia, Austria and Prussia, swooped down upon the\r\nglorious but unhappy country, torn by internal trouble, and determined to\r\nkill it and divide up its dominions. All were alike guilty, as far as\r\nmotive went. But Holy Russia--Holy!--since that horrible time has taken\r\nupon herself by far the greatest burden of political crime in her\r\ndealings with that noble nation. Every evil passion bred of despotism, of\r\ntheological hatred, of rancorous ancient enmities, and the ghastliest\r\nofficial corruption, have combined in Russian action for more than one\r\nhundred and fifty years, to turn Poland into a hell on earth. Her very\r\nlanguage was proscribed.\r\n\r\nThis is not the place to give details of that unhappy country's woes. But\r\nsuffice it to say, that Poland, in spite of fatuous prohibitions, has had\r\na great literature since the loss of her independence, and that\r\nliterature has so kept alive the soul of the nation, that with justice\r\nPoland sings her great patriotic song:\r\n\r\n  \"Poland is not yet lost\r\n  As long as we live....\"\r\n\r\nThe nation is still alive in its writers and their works, their splendid\r\npoetry and prose.\r\n\r\nIt is a pity that so few of these great writers are widely known. But\r\nmost people have heard of Jan Kochanowski, of Mikolaj Rey, of Rubinski,\r\nof Szymanowicz, of Poland's great genius in this century, one of the\r\nsupreme poets of the world, Adam Mickiewicz, of Joseph Ignac, of\r\nKraszewski, who is as prolific in literary and scientific works as\r\nAlexander von Humboldt, and of hundreds of others in all branches of\r\nscience and art, too numerous to mention here.\r\n\r\nAnd it is remarkable that the author of this book, Henryk Sienkiewicz,\r\nshould of late have attained such prominence in the public eye and found\r\na place in the heart of mankind. It is of good omen. Thus, Poland, in\r\nspite of her fetters, is keeping step in the very van of the most\r\nprogressive nations.\r\n\r\nThe romance of Sienkiewicz in this volume is perhaps the most interesting\r\nand fascinating he has yet produced. It is in the very first rank of\r\nimaginative and historical romance. The time and scene of the noble story\r\nare laid in the middle ages during the conquest of Pagan Lithuania by the\r\nmilitary and priestly order of the \"Krzyzacy\" Knights of the Cross. And\r\nthe story exhibits with splendid force the collision of race passions and\r\nfierce, violent individualities which accompanied that struggle. Those\r\nwho read it will, in addition to their thrilling interest in the tragical\r\nand varied incidents, gain no little insight into the origin and working\r\nof the inextinguishable race hatred between Teuton and Slav. It was an\r\nunfortunate thing surely, that the conversion of the heathen Lithuanians\r\nand Zmudzians was committed so largely to that curious variety of the\r\nmissionary, the armed knight, banded in brotherhood, sacred and military.\r\nTo say the least, his sword was a weapon dangerous to his evangelizing\r\npurpose. He was always in doubt whether to present to the heathen the one\r\nend of it, as a cross for adoration, or the other, as a point _to kill\r\nwith_. And so, if Poland _was_ made a Catholic nation, she was also made\r\nan undying and unalterable hater of the German, the Teutonic name and\r\nperson.\r\n\r\nAnd so this noble, historical tale, surpassed perhaps by none in\r\nliterature, is commended to the thoughtful attention and appreciation of\r\nthe reader.\r\n\r\nSAMUEL A. BINION.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, May 9, 1899.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKNIGHTS OF THE CROSS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART FIRST\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nIn Tyniec,[1] in the inn under \"Dreadful Urus,\" which belonged to the\r\nabbey, a few people were sitting, listening to the talk of a military man\r\nwho had come from afar, and was telling them of the adventures which he\r\nhad experienced during the war and his journey.\r\n\r\nHe had a large beard but he was not yet old, and he was almost gigantic\r\nbut thin, with broad shoulders; he wore his hair in a net ornamented with\r\nbeads; he was dressed in a leather jacket, which was marked by the\r\ncuirass, and he wore a belt composed of brass buckles; in the belt he had\r\na knife in a horn scabbard, and at his side a short traveling sword.\r\n\r\nNear by him at the table, was sitting a youth with long hair and joyful\r\nlook, evidently his comrade, or perhaps a shield-bearer, because he also\r\nwas dressed as for a journey in a similar leather jacket. The rest of the\r\ncompany was composed of two noblemen from the vicinity of Krakow and of\r\nthree townsmen with red folding caps, the thin tops of which were hanging\r\ndown their sides to their elbows.\r\n\r\nThe host, a German, dressed in a faded cowl with large, white collar, was\r\npouring beer for them from a bucket into earthen mugs, and in the\r\nmeanwhile he was listening with great curiosity to the military\r\nadventures.\r\n\r\nThe burghers were listening with still greater curiosity. In these times,\r\nthe hatred, which during the time of King Lokietek had separated the city\r\nand the knighthood, had been very much quenched, and the burghers were\r\nprouder than in the following centuries. They called them still _des\r\nallerdurchluchtigsten Kuniges und Herren_ and they appreciated their\r\nreadiness _ad concessionem pecuniarum_; therefore one would very often\r\nsee in the inns, the merchants drinking with the noblemen like brothers.\r\nThey were even welcome, because having plenty of money, usually they paid\r\nfor those who had coats of arms.\r\n\r\nTherefore they were sitting there and talking, from time to time winking\r\nat the host to fill up the mugs.\r\n\r\n\"Noble knight, you have seen a good piece of the world!\" said one of the\r\nmerchants.\r\n\r\n\"Not many of those who are now coming to Krakow from all parts, have seen\r\nas much,\" answered the knight.\r\n\r\n\"There will be plenty of them,\" said the merchant. \"There is to be a\r\ngreat feast and great pleasure for the king and the queen! The king has\r\nordered the queen's chamber to be upholstered with golden brocade,\r\nembroidered with pearls, and a canopy of the same material over her.\r\nThere will be such entertainments and tournaments, as the world has never\r\nseen before.\"\r\n\r\n\"Uncle Gamroth, don't interrupt the knight,\" said the second merchant.\r\n\r\n\"Friend Eyertreter, I am not interrupting; only I think that he also will\r\nbe glad to know about what they are talking, because I am sure he is\r\ngoing to Krakow. We cannot return to the city to-day at any rate, because\r\nthey will shut the gates.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you speak twenty words, in reply to one. You are growing old, Uncle\r\nGamroth!\"\r\n\r\n\"But I can carry a whole piece of wet broadcloth just the same.\"\r\n\r\n\"Great thing! the cloth through which one can see, as through a sieve.\"\r\n\r\nBut further dispute was stopped by the knight, who said:\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I will stay in Krakow because I have heard about the tournaments\r\nand I will be glad to try my strength in the lists during the combats;\r\nand this youth, my nephew, who although young and smooth faced, has\r\nalready seen many cuirasses on the ground, will also enter the lists.\"\r\n\r\nThe guests glanced at the youth who laughed mirthfully, and putting his\r\nlong hair behind his ears, placed the mug of beer to his mouth.\r\n\r\nThe older knight added:\r\n\r\n\"Even if we would like to return, we have no place to go.\"\r\n\r\n\"How is that?\" asked one of the nobles.\r\n\r\n\"Where are you from, and what do they call you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am Macko of Bogdaniec, and this lad, the son of my brother, calls\r\nhimself Zbyszko. Our coat of arms is Tempa Podkowa, and our war-cry is\r\nGrady!\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is Bogdaniec?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah! better ask, lord brother, where it was, because it is no more.\r\nDuring the war between Grzymalczyks and Nalenczs,[2] Bogdaniec was\r\nburned, and we were robbed of everything; the servants ran away. Only the\r\nbare soil remained, because even the farmers who were in the\r\nneighborhood, fled into the forests. The father of this lad, rebuilt; but\r\nthe next year, a flood took everything. Then my brother died, and after\r\nhis death I remained with the orphan. Then I thought: 'I can't stay!' I\r\nheard about the war for which Jasko of Olesnica, whom the king,\r\nWladyslaw, sent to Wilno after he sent Mikolaj of Moskorzowo, was\r\ncollecting soldiers. I knew a worthy abbot, Janko of Tulcza, to whom I\r\ngave my land as security for the money I needed to buy armor and horses,\r\nnecessary for a war expedition. The boy, twelve years old, I put on a\r\nyoung horse and we went to Jasko of Olesnica.\"\r\n\r\n\"With the youth?\"\r\n\r\n\"He was not even a youth then, but he has been strong since childhood.\r\nWhen he was twelve, he used to rest a crossbow on the ground, press it\r\nagainst his chest and turn the crank. None of the Englishmen, whom I have\r\nseen in Wilno, could do better.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was he so strong?\"\r\n\r\n\"He used to carry my helmet, and when he passed thirteen winters, he\r\ncould carry my spear also.\"\r\n\r\n\"You had plenty of fighting there!\"\r\n\r\n\"Because of Witold. The prince was with the Knights of the Cross, and\r\nevery year they used to make an expedition against Lithuania, as far as\r\nWilno. Different people went with them: Germans, Frenchmen, Englishmen,\r\nwho are the best bowmen, Czechs, Swiss and Burgundians. They cut down the\r\nforests, burned the castles on their way and finally they devastated\r\nLithuania with fire and sword so badly, that the people who were living\r\nin that country, wanted to leave it and search for another land, even to\r\nthe end of the world, even among Belial's children, only far from the\r\nGermans.\"\r\n\r\n\"We heard here, that the Lithuanians wanted to go away with their wives\r\nand children, but we did not believe it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I looked at it. Hej! If not for Mikolaj of Moskorzowo, for Jasko of\r\nOlesnica, and without any boasting, if not for us, there would be no\r\nWilno now.\"\r\n\r\n\"We know. You did not surrender the castle.\"\r\n\r\n\"We did not. And now notice what I am going to say, because I have\r\nexperience in military matters. The old people used to say: 'furious\r\nLitwa'[3]--and it's true! They fight well, but they cannot withstand the\r\nknights in the field. When the horses of the Germans are sunk in the\r\nmarshes, or when there is a thick forest--that's different.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Germans are good soldiers!\" exclaimed the burghers.\r\n\r\n\"They stay like a wall, man beside man, in their iron armor. They advance\r\nin one compact body. They strike, and the Litwa are scattered like sand,\r\nor throw themselves flat on the ground and are trampled down. There are\r\nnot only Germans among them, because men of all nations serve with the\r\nKnights of the Cross. And they are brave! Often before a battle a knight\r\nstoops, stretches his lance, and rushes alone against the whole army.\"\r\n\r\n\"Christ!\" exclaimed Gamroth. \"And who among them are the best soldiers?\"\r\n\r\n\"It depends. With the crossbow, the best is the Englishman, who can\r\npierce a suit of armor through and through, and at a hundred steps he\r\nwill not miss a dove. Czechowie (Bohemians) cut dreadfully with axes. For\r\nthe big two-handed sword the German is the best. The Swiss is glad to\r\nstrike the helmets with an iron flail, but the greatest knights are those\r\nwho come from France. These will fight on horseback and on foot, and in\r\nthe meanwhile they will speak very brave words, which however you will\r\nnot understand, because it is such a strange language. They are pious\r\npeople. They criticise us through the Germans. They say we are defending\r\nthe heathen and the Turks against the cross, and they want to prove it by\r\na knightly duel. And such God's judgment is going to be held between four\r\nknights from their side, and four from our side, and they are going to\r\nfight at the the court of Waclaw, the Roman and Bohemian king.\"[4]\r\n\r\nHere the curiosity so increased among the noblemen and merchants, that\r\nthey stretched their necks in the direction of Macko of Bogdaniec and\r\nthey asked:\r\n\r\n\"And who are the knights from our side? Speak quickly!\" Macko raised the\r\nmug to his mouth, drank and then answered:\r\n\r\n\"Ej, don't be afraid about them. There is Jan of Wloszczowa, castellan of\r\nDobrzyn; there's Mikolaj of Waszmuntow; there are Jasko of Zdakow and\r\nJarosz of Czechow: all glorious knights and sturdy fellows. No matter\r\nwhich weapons they choose,--swords or axes--nothing new to them! It will\r\nbe worth while for human eyes to see it and for human ears to hear\r\nit--because, as I said, even if you press the throat of a Frenchman with\r\nyour foot, he will still reply with knightly words. Therefore so help me\r\nGod and Holy Cross they will outtalk us, but our knights will defeat\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"That will be glory, if God will bless us,\" said one of the nobles.\r\n\r\n\"And Saint Stanislaw!\" added another. Then turning toward Macko, he asked\r\nhim further:\r\n\r\n\"Well! tell us some more! You praised the Germans and other knights\r\nbecause they are valiant and have conquered Litwa easily. Did they not\r\nhave harder work with you? Did they go against you readily? How did it\r\nhappen? Praise our knights.\"\r\n\r\nBut evidently Macko of Bogdaniec was not a braggart, because he answered\r\nmodestly:\r\n\r\n\"Those who had just returned from foreign lands, attacked us readily; but\r\nafter they tried once or twice, they attacked us with less assurance,\r\nbecause our people are hardened and they reproached us for that hardness:\r\n'You despise,' they used to say,'death, but you help the Saracens, and\r\nyou will be damned for it.' And with us the deadly grudge increased,\r\nbecause their taunt is not true! The king and the queen have christened\r\nLitwa and everyone there tries to worship the Lord Christ although not\r\neveryone knows how. And it is known also, that our gracious lord, when in\r\nthe cathedral of Plock they threw down the devil, ordered them to put a\r\ncandle before him--and the priests were obliged to tell him that he ought\r\nnot to do it. No wonder then about an ordinary man! Therefore many of\r\nthem say to themselves:\r\n\r\n\"'The _kniaz_[5] ordered us to be baptized, therefore I was baptized; he\r\nordered us to bow before the Christ, and I bowed; but why should I grudge\r\na little piece of cheese to the old heathen devils, or why should I not\r\nthrow them some turnips; why should I not pour the foam off of the beer?\r\nIf I do not do it, then my horses will die; or my cows will be sick, or\r\ntheir milk will turn into blood--or there will be some trouble with the\r\nharvest.' And many of them do this, and they are suspected. But they are\r\ndoing it because of their ignorance and their fear of the devils. Those\r\ndevils were better off in times of yore. They used to have their own\r\ngroves and they used to take the horses which they rode for their tithe.\r\nBut to-day, the groves are cut down and they have nothing to eat--in the\r\ncities the bells ring, therefore the devils are hiding in the thickest\r\nforest, and they howl there from loneliness. If a Litwin[6] goes to the\r\nforest, then they pull him by his sheep-skin overcoat and they say:\r\n'Give!' Some of them give, but there are also courageous boys, who will\r\nnot give and then the devils catch them. One of the boys put some beans\r\nin an ox bladder and immediately three hundred devils entered there. And\r\nhe stuffed the bladder with a service-tree peg, brought them to Wilno and\r\nsold them to the Franciscan priests, who gave him twenty _skojcow_[7] he\r\ndid this to destroy the enemies of Christ's name. I have seen that\r\nbladder with my own eyes; a dreadful stench came from it, because in that\r\nway those dirty spirits manifested their fear before holy water.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who counted them, that you know there were three hundred devils,\"\r\nasked the merchant Gamroth, intelligently.\r\n\r\n\"The Litwin counted them, when he saw them entering the bladder. It was\r\nevident that they were there, because one would know it from the stench,\r\nand nobody wished to take out the peg to count them.\"\r\n\r\n\"What wonders, what wonders!\" exclaimed one of the nobles.\r\n\r\n\"I have seen many great wonders, because everything is peculiar among\r\nthem. They are shaggy and hardly any _kniaz_ combs his hair; they live on\r\nbaked turnips, which they prefer to any other food, because they say that\r\nbravery comes from eating them. They live in the forests with their\r\ncattle and snakes; they are not abstinent in eating nor drinking. They\r\ndespise the married women, but greatly respect the girls to whom they\r\nattribute great power. They say that if a girl rubs a man with dried\r\nleaves, it will stop colic.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's worth while to have colic, if the women are beautiful!\" exclaimed\r\nUncle Eyertreter.\r\n\r\n\"Ask Zbyszko about it,\" answered Macko of Bogdaniec.\r\n\r\nZbyszko laughed so heartily that the bench began to shake beneath him.\r\n\r\n\"There are some beautiful ones,\" he said. \"Ryngalla was charming.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is Ryngalla? Quick!\"\r\n\r\n\"What? you haven't heard about Ryngalla?\" asked Macko.\r\n\r\n\"We have not heard a word.\"\r\n\r\n\"She was Witold's sister, and the wife of Henryk, Prince Mazowiecki.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't say! Which Prince Henryk? There was only one Prince\r\nMazowiecki, elect[8] of Plock, but he died.\"\r\n\r\n\"The same one. He expected a dispensation from Rome, but death gave him\r\nhis dispensation, because evidently he had not pleased God by his action.\r\nJasko of Olesnica sent me with a letter to Prince Witold, when Prince\r\nHenryk, elect of Plock, was sent by the king to Ryterswerder. At that\r\ntime, Witold was tired of the war, because he could not capture Wilno,\r\nand our king was tired of his own brothers and their dissipation. The\r\nking having noticed that Witold was shrewder and more intelligent than\r\nhis own brothers, sent the bishop to him, to persuade him to leave the\r\nKnights of the Cross, and return to his allegiance, for which he promised\r\nto make him ruler over Litwa. Witold, always fond of changing, listened\r\nwith pleasure to the embassy. There were also a feast and tournaments.\r\nThe elect mounted a horse, although the other bishops did not approve of\r\nit, and in the lists he showed his knightly strength. All the princes of\r\nMazowsze are very strong; it is well known, that even the girls of that\r\nblood can easily break horseshoes. In the beginning the prince threw\r\nthree knights from their saddles; the second time he threw five of them.\r\nHe threw me from my saddle, and in the beginning of the encounter,\r\nZbyszko's horse reared and he was thrown. The prince took all the prizes\r\nfrom the hands of the beautiful Ryngalla, before whom he kneeled in full\r\narmor. They fell so much in love with each other, that dining the feasts,\r\nthe _clerici_[9] pulled him from her by his sleeves and her brother,\r\nWitold, restrained her. The prince said: 'I will give myself a\r\ndispensation, and the pope, if not the one in Home, then the one in\r\nAvignon, will confirm it, but I must marry her immediately--otherwise I\r\nwill burn up!' It was a great offence against God, but Witold did not\r\ndare to oppose him, because he did not want to displease the\r\nembassador--and so there was a wedding. Then they went to Suraz, and\r\nafterward to Sluck, to the great sorrow of this youth, Zbyszko, who,\r\naccording to the German custom, had selected the Princess Ryngalla to be\r\nthe lady of his heart and had promised her eternal fidelity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah!\" suddenly interrupted Zbyszko, \"it's true. But afterward the people\r\nsaid that Ryngalla regretted being the wife of the elect (because he,\r\nalthough married, did not want to renounce his spiritual dignity) and\r\nfeeling that God's blessing could not be over such a marriage, poisoned\r\nher husband. When I heard that, I asked a pious hermit, living not far\r\nfrom Lublin, to absolve me from that vow.\"\r\n\r\n\"He was a hermit,\" answered Macko, laughing, \"but was he pious? I don't\r\nknow; we went to him on Friday, and he was splitting bear's bones with an\r\naxe, and sucking the marrow so hard, that there was music in his throat.\"\r\n\r\n\"But he said that the marrow was not meat, and besides he had received\r\npermission to do it, because after sucking marrow, he used to have\r\nmarvelous visions during his sleep and the next day he could prophesy\r\nuntil noontime.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well!\" answered Macko. \"And the beautiful Ryngalla is a widow and\r\nshe may call you to her service.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would be in vain, because I am going to choose another lady, whom I\r\nwill serve till death, and then I will find a wife.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must first find the girdle of a knight.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Owa!_[10] There will be plenty of tournaments. And before that the king\r\nwill not dub a single knight. I can measure myself against any. The\r\nprince could not have thrown me down, if my horse had not reared.\"\r\n\r\n\"There will be knights here better than you are.\"\r\n\r\nHere the noblemen began to shout:\r\n\r\n\"For heaven's sake! Here, in the presence of the queen, will fight not\r\nsuch as you, but only the most famous knights in the world. Here will\r\nfight Zawisza of Garbow and Farurej, Dobko of Olesnica, Powala of Taczew,\r\nPaszko Zlodzie of Biskupice, Jasko Naszan and Abdank of Gora. Andrzej of\r\nBrochocice, Krystyn of Ostrow, and Jakob of Kobylany! Can you measure\r\nyour sword against the swords of those, with whom neither the knights\r\nhere, nor of the Bohemian court, nor of the Hungarian court can compete?\r\nWhat are you talking about? Are you better then they? How old are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Eighteen,\" answered Zbyszko.\r\n\r\n\"Everyone of them could crush you between his fingers.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will see.\"\r\n\r\nBut Macko said:\r\n\r\n\"I have heard that the king rewarded those knights munificently who\r\nreturned from the Lithuanian war. Speak, you belong here; is it true?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is true!\" answered one of the nobles. \"The king's munificence is\r\nknown to the world; but it will be difficult to get near him now, because\r\nthe guests are swarming to Krakow; they are coming to be in time for the\r\nqueen's confinement and for the christening, wishing to show reverence to\r\nour lord and to render him homage. The king of Hungary is coming; they\r\nsay the Roman emperor will be here also, and plenty of princes, counts\r\nand knights, will come because not one of them expects to return with\r\nempty hands. They even say that Pope Boniface, himself will arrive,\r\nbecause he also needs favor and help from our lord against his adversary\r\nin Avignon. Therefore in such a crowd, it will be difficult to approach\r\nthe king; but if one would be able to see him and bow at his feet, then\r\nhe will liberally reward him who deserves it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I will bow before him, because I have served enough, and if there\r\nis another war, I shall go again. We have taken some booty, and we are\r\nnot poor; but I am getting old, and when one is old, and the strength has\r\nleft his bones, one is pleased to have a quiet corner.\"\r\n\r\n\"The king was glad to see those who returned from Litwa with Jasko of\r\nOlesnica; and they feast well now.\"\r\n\r\n\"You see I did not return at that time; I was still at the war. You know\r\nthat the Germans have suffered because of that reconciliation between the\r\nking and _Kniaz_ Witold. The prince cunningly got the hostages back, and\r\nthen rushed against the Germans! He ruined and burned the castle and\r\nslaughtered the knights and a great many of the people. The Germans\r\nwanted revenge, as did also Swidrygello, who went to them. There was\r\nagain a great expedition started. The grand master Kondrat himself went\r\nwith a great army; they besieged Wilno, and tried from their towers to\r\nruin the castles; they also tried to capture the city by treachery--but\r\nthey did not succeed! While retreating there were so many killed, that\r\neven half of them did not escape. Then we attacked Ulrich von Jungingen,\r\nthe grand master's brother, who is bailiff in Swabja. But the bailiff was\r\nafraid of the _kniaz_ and ran away. On account of this flight there is\r\npeace, and they are rebuilding the city. One pious monk, who could walk\r\nwith bare feet on hot iron, has prophesied since that time, that as long\r\nas the world exists, no German soldier will be seen under the walls of\r\nWilno. And if that be so, then whose hands have done it?\"\r\n\r\nHaving said this, Macko of Bogdaniec, extended his palms, broad and\r\nenormous; the others began to nod and to approve:\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes! It's true what he says! Yes!\"\r\n\r\nBut further conversation was interrupted by a noise entering through the\r\nwindows from which the bladders had been taken out, because the night was\r\nwarm and clear. From afar thrumming, singing, laughing and the snorting\r\nof horses were heard. They were surprised because it was quite late. The\r\nhost rushed to the yard of the inn, but before the guests were able to\r\ndrink their beer to the last drop, he returned shouting:\r\n\r\n\"Some court is coming!\"\r\n\r\nA moment afterward, in the door appeared a footman dressed in a blue\r\njacket and wearing a red folding cap. He stopped, glanced at the guests,\r\nand then having perceived the host, he said:\r\n\r\n\"Wipe the tables and prepare lights; the princess, Anna Danuta, will stop\r\nhere to-night.\"\r\n\r\nHaving said this, he withdrew. In the inn a great commotion began; the\r\nhost called his servants, and the guests looked at one another with great\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n\"Princess Anna Danuta,\" said one of the townsmen, \"she is\r\nKiejstutowna,[11] Janusz Mazowiecki's wife. She was in Krakow two weeks,\r\nbut she went to Zator to visit Prince Waclaw, and now she is coming\r\nback.\"\r\n\r\n\"Uncle Gamroth,\" said the other townsman, \"let us go to the barn and\r\nsleep on the hay; the company is too high for us.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't wonder they are traveling during the night,\" said Macko,\r\n\"because the days are very warm; but why do they come to the inn when the\r\nmonastery is so near?\"\r\n\r\nHere he turned toward Zbyszko:\r\n\r\n\"The beautiful Ryngalla's own sister; do you understand?\"\r\n\r\nAnd Zbyszko answered:\r\n\r\n\"There must be many Mazovian ladies with her, hej!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nAt that moment the princess entered. She was a middle-aged lady with a\r\nsmiling face, dressed in a red mantle and light green dress with a golden\r\ngirdle around her hips. The princess was followed by the ladies of the\r\ncourt; some not yet grown up, some of them older; they had pink and lilac\r\nwreaths on their heads, and the majority of them had lutes in their\r\nhands. Some of them carried large bunches of fresh, flowers, evidently\r\nplucked by the roadside. The room was soon filled, because the ladies\r\nwere followed by some courtiers and young pages. All were lively, with\r\nmirth on their faces, talking loudly or humming as if they were\r\nintoxicated with the beauty of the night. Among the courtiers, there were\r\ntwo _rybalts_;[12] one had a lute and the other had a _gensla_[13] at his\r\ngirdle. One of the girls who was very young, perhaps twelve years old,\r\ncarried behind the princess a very small lute ornamented with brass\r\nnails.\r\n\r\n\"May Jesus Christ be praised!\" said the princess, standing in the centre\r\nof the room.\r\n\r\n\"For ages and ages, amen!\" answered those present, in the meanwhile\r\nsaluting very profoundly.\r\n\r\n\"Where is the host?\"\r\n\r\nThe German having heard the call, advanced to the front and kneeled, in\r\nthe German fashion, on one knee.\r\n\r\n\"We are going to stop here and rest,\" said the lady. \"Only be quick,\r\nbecause we are hungry.\"\r\n\r\nThe townsmen had already gone; now the two noblemen, and with them Macko\r\nof Bogdaniec and young Zbyszko, bowed again, intending to leave the room,\r\nas they did not wish to interfere with the court.\r\n\r\nBut the princess detained them.\r\n\r\n\"You are noblemen; you do not intrude, you are acquainted with courtiers.\r\nFrom where has God conducted you?\"\r\n\r\nThen they mentioned their names,[14] their coats of arms, their nicknames\r\nand the estates from which they received their names. The lady having\r\nheard from _wlodyka_[15] Macko that he had been to Wilno, clapped her\r\nhands, and said:\r\n\r\n\"How well it has happened! Tell us about Wilno and about my brother and\r\nsister. Is Prince Witold coming for the queen's confinement and for the\r\nchristening?\"\r\n\r\n\"He would like to, but does not know whether he will be able to do so;\r\ntherefore he sent a silver cradle to the queen for a present. My nephew\r\nand I brought that cradle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then the cradle is here? I would like to see it! All silver?\"\r\n\r\n\"All silver; but it is not here. The Basilians took it to Krakow.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what are you doing in Tyniec?\"\r\n\r\n\"We returned here to see the procurator of the monastery who is our\r\nrelative, in order to deposit with the worthy monks, that with which the\r\nwar has blessed us and that which the prince gave us for a present.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then God gave you good luck and valuable booty? But tell me why my\r\nbrother is uncertain whether he will come?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because he is preparing an expedition against the Tartars.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it; but I am grieved that the queen did not prophesy a happy\r\nresult for that expedition, and everything she predicts is always\r\nfulfilled.\"\r\n\r\nMacko smiled.\r\n\r\n\"Ej, our lady is a prophetess, I cannot deny; but with Prince Witold, the\r\nmight of our knighthood will go, splendid men, against whom nobody is\r\nable to contend.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you not going?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I was sent with the cradle, and for five years I have not taken off\r\nmy armor,\" answered Macko, showing the furrows made by the cuirass on his\r\nreindeer jacket; \"but let me rest, then I will go, or if I do not go\r\nmyself then I will send this youth, my nephew, Zbyszko, to Pan[16] Spytko\r\nof Melsztyn, under whose command all our knights will go.\"\r\n\r\nPrincess Danuta glanced at Zbyszko's beautiful figure; but further\r\nconversation was interrupted by the arrival of a monk from the monastery,\r\nwho having greeted the princess, began to humbly reproach her, because\r\nshe had not sent a courier with the news that she was coming, and because\r\nshe had not stopped at the monastery, but in an ordinary inn which was\r\nnot worthy of her majesty. There are plenty of houses and buildings in\r\nthe monastery where even an ordinary man will find hospitality, and\r\nroyalty is still more welcome, especially the wife of that prince from\r\nwhose ancestors and relatives, the abbey had experienced so many\r\nbenefits.\r\n\r\nBut the princess answered mirthfully:\r\n\r\n\"We came here only to stretch our limbs; in the morning we must be in\r\nKrakow. We sleep during the day and we travel during the night, because\r\nit is cooler. As the roosters were crowing, I did not wish to awaken the\r\npious monks, especially with such a company which thinks more about\r\nsinging and dancing than about repose.\"\r\n\r\nBut when the monk still insisted, she added:\r\n\r\n\"No. We will stay here. We will spend the time well in singing lay songs,\r\nbut we will come to the church for matins in order to begin the day with\r\nGod.\"\r\n\r\n\"There will be a mass for the welfare of the gracious prince and the\r\ngracious princess,\" said the monk.\r\n\r\n\"The prince, my husband, will not come for four or five days.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Lord God will be able to grant happiness even from afar, and in the\r\nmeanwhile let us poor monks at least bring some wine from the monastery.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will gladly repay,\" said the princess.\r\n\r\nWhen the monk went out, she called:\r\n\r\n\"Hej, Danusia! Danusia! Mount the bench and make our hearts merry with\r\nthe same song you sang in Zator.\"\r\n\r\nHaving heard this, the courtiers put a bench in the centre of the room.\r\nThe _rybalts_ sat on the ends, and between them stood that young girl who\r\nhad carried behind the princess the lute ornamented with brass nails. On\r\nher head she had a small garland, her hair falling on her shoulders, and\r\nshe wore a blue dress and red shoes with long points. On the bench she\r\nlooked like a child, but at the same time, a beautiful child, like some\r\nfigure from a church. It was evident that she was not singing for the\r\nfirst time before the princess, because she was not embarrassed.\r\n\r\n\"Sing, Danusia, sing!\" the young court girls shouted.\r\n\r\nShe seized the lute, raised her head like a bird which begins to sing,\r\nand having closed her eyes, she began with a silvery voice:\r\n\r\n  \"If I only could get\r\n  The wings like a birdie,\r\n  I would fly quickly\r\n  To my dearest Jasiek!\"\r\n\r\nThe _rybalts_ accompanied her, one on the _gensliks_, the other on a big\r\nlute; the princess, who loved the lay songs better than anything else in\r\nthe world, began to move her head back and forth, and the young girl sang\r\nfurther with a thin, sweet childish voice, like a bird singing in the\r\nforest:\r\n\r\n  \"I would then be seated\r\n  On the high enclosure:\r\n  Look, my dear Jasiulku,\r\n  Look on me, poor orphan.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then the _rybalts_ played. The young Zbyszko of Bogdaniec, who being\r\naccustomed from childhood to war and its dreadful sights, had never in\r\nhis life heard anything like it; he touched a Mazur[17] standing beside\r\nhim and asked:\r\n\r\n\"Who is she?\"\r\n\r\n\"She is a girl from the princess' court. We do not lack _rybalts_ who\r\ncheer up the court, but she is the sweetest little _rybalt_ of them all,\r\nand to the songs of no one else will the princess listen so gladly.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't wonder. I thought she was an angel from heaven and I can't look\r\nat her enough. What do they call her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you not heard? Danusia. Her father is Jurand of Spychow, a\r\n_comes_[18] mighty and gallant.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hej! Such a girl human eyes never saw before!\"\r\n\r\n\"Everybody loves her for her singing and her beauty.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who is her knight?\"\r\n\r\n\"She is only a child yet!\"\r\n\r\nFurther conversation was stopped by Danusia's singing. Zbyszko looked at\r\nher fair hair, her uplifted head, her half-closed eyes, and at her whole\r\nfigure lighted by the glare of the wax candles and by the glare of the\r\nmoonbeams entering through the windows; and he wondered more and more. It\r\nseemed to him now, that he had seen her before; but he could not remember\r\nwhether it was in a dream, or somewhere in Krakow on the pane of a church\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\nAnd again he touched the courtier and asked in a low voice:\r\n\r\n\"Then she is from your court?\"\r\n\r\n\"Her mother came from Litwa with the princess, Anna Danuta, who married\r\nher to Count Jurand of Spychow. She was pretty and belonged to a powerful\r\nfamily; the princess liked her better than any of the other young girls\r\nand she loved the princess. That is the reason she gave the same name to\r\nher daughter--Anna Danuta. But five years ago, when near Zlotorja, the\r\nGermans attacked the court,--she died from fear. Then the princess took\r\nthe girl, and she has taken care of her since. Her father often comes to\r\nthe court; he is glad that the princess is bringing his child up healthy\r\nand in happiness. But every time he looks at her, he cries, remembering\r\nhis wife; then he returns to avenge on the Germans his awful wrong. He\r\nloved his wife more dearly than any one in the whole Mazowsze till now\r\nhas loved; but he has killed in revenge a great many Germans.\"\r\n\r\nIn a moment Zbyszko's eyes were shining and the veins on his forehead\r\nswelled.\r\n\r\n\"Then the Germans killed her mother?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Killed and not killed. She died from fear. Five years ago there was\r\npeace; nobody was thinking about war and everybody felt safe. The prince\r\nwent without any soldiers, only with the court, as usual during peace, to\r\nbuild a tower in Zlotorja. Those traitors, the Germans, fell upon them\r\nwithout any declaration of war, without any reason. They seized the\r\nprince himself, and remembering neither God's anger, nor that from the\r\nprince's ancestor, they had received great benefits, they bound him to a\r\nhorse and slaughtered his people. The prince was a prisoner a long time,\r\nand only when King Wladyslaw threatened them with war, did they release\r\nhim. During this attack Danusia's mother died.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you, sir, were you there? What do they call you? I have forgotten!\"\r\n\r\n\"My name is Mikolaj of Dlugolas and they call me Obuch.[19] I was there.\r\nI saw a German with peacock feathers on his helmet, bind her to his\r\nsaddle; and then she died from fear. They cut me with a halberd from\r\nwhich I have a scar.\"\r\n\r\nHaving said this he showed a deep scar on his head coming from beneath\r\nhis hair to his eyebrows.\r\n\r\nThere was a moment of silence. Zbyszko was again looking at Danusia. Then\r\nhe asked:\r\n\r\n\"And you said, sir, that she has no knight?\"\r\n\r\nBut he did not receive any answer, because at that moment the singing\r\nstopped. One of the _rybalts_, a fat and heavy man, suddenly rose, and\r\nthe bench tilted to one side. Danusia tottered and stretched out her\r\nlittle hands, but before she could fall or jump, Zbyszko rushed up like a\r\nwild-cat and seized her in his arms.\r\n\r\nThe princess, who at first screamed from fear, laughed immediately and\r\nbegan to shout:\r\n\r\n\"Here is Danusia's knight! Come, little knight and give us back our dear\r\nlittle girl!\"\r\n\r\n\"He grasped her boldly,\" some among the courtiers were heard to say.\r\n\r\nZbyszko walked toward the princess, holding Danusia to his breast, who\r\nhaving encircled his neck with one arm, held the lute with the other,\r\nbeing afraid it would be broken. Her face was smiling and pleased,\r\nalthough a little bit frightened.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile the youth came near the princess, put Danusia before\r\nher, kneeled, raised his head and said with remarkable boldness for his\r\nage:\r\n\r\n\"Let it be then according to your word, my gracious lady! It is time for\r\nthis gentle young girl to have her knight, and it is time for me to have\r\nmy lady, whose beauty and virtues I shall extol. With your permission, I\r\nwish to make a vow and I will remain faithful to her under all\r\ncircumstances until death.\"\r\n\r\nThe princess was surprised, not on account of Zbyszko's words, but\r\nbecause everything had happened so suddenly. It is true that the custom\r\nof making vows was not Polish; but Mazowsze, being situated on the German\r\nfrontier, and often being visited by the knights from remote countries,\r\nwas more familiar with that custom than the other provinces, and imitated\r\nit very often. The princess had also heard about it in her father's\r\ncourt, where all eastern customs were considered as the law and the\r\nexample for the noble warriors. Therefore she did not see in Zbyszko's\r\naction anything which could offend either herself or Danusia. She was\r\neven glad that her dear girl had attracted the heart and the eyes of a\r\nknight.\r\n\r\nTherefore she turned her joyful face toward the girl.\r\n\r\n\"Danusia! Danusia! Do you wish to have your own knight?\"\r\n\r\nThe fair-haired Danusia after jumping three times in her red shoes,\r\nseized the princess by the neck and began to scream with joy, as though\r\nthey were promising her some pleasure permitted to the older people only.\r\n\r\n\"I wish, I wish----!\"\r\n\r\nThe princess' eyes were filled with tears from laughing and the whole\r\ncourt laughed with her; then the lady said to Zbyszko:\r\n\r\n\"Well, make your vow! Make your vow! What will you promise her?\"\r\n\r\nBut Zbyszko, who preserved his seriousness undisturbed amidst the\r\nlaughter, said with dignity, while still kneeling:\r\n\r\n\"I promise that as soon as I reach Krakow, I will hang my spear on the\r\ndoor of the inn, and on it I will put a card, which a student in writing\r\nwill write for me. On the card I will proclaim that Panna Danuta\r\nJurandowna is the prettiest and most virtuous girl among all living in\r\nthis or any other kingdom. Anyone who wishes to contradict this\r\ndeclaration, I will fight until one of us dies or is taken into\r\ncaptivity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well! I see you know the knightly custom. And what more?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have learned from Pan Mikolaj of Dlugolas that the death of Panna\r\nJurandowna's mother was caused by the brutality of a German who wore the\r\ncrest of a peacock. Therefore I vow to gird my naked sides with a hempen\r\nrope, and even though it eat me to the bone, I will wear it until I tear\r\nthree such tufts of feathers from the heads of German warriors whom I\r\nkill.\"\r\n\r\nHere the princess became serious.\r\n\r\n\"Don't make any joke of your vows!\"\r\n\r\nAnd Zbyszko added:\r\n\r\n\"So help me God and holy cross, this vow I will repeat in church before a\r\npriest.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a praiseworthy thing to fight against the enemy of our people; but\r\nI pity you, because you are young, and you can easily perish.\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment Macko of Bogdanice approached, thinking it proper to\r\nreassure the princess.\r\n\r\n\"Gracious lady, do not be frightened about that. Everybody must risk\r\nbeing killed in a fight, and it is a laudable end for a _wlodyka_, old or\r\nyoung. But war is not new nor strange to this man, because although he is\r\nonly a youth, he has fought on horseback and on foot, with spear and with\r\naxe, with short sword and with long sword, with lance and without. It is\r\na new custom, for a knight to vow to a girl whom he sees for the first\r\ntime; but I do not blame Zbyszko for his promise. He has fought the\r\nGermans before. Let him fight them again, and if during that fight a few\r\nheads are broken, his glory will increase.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see that we have to do with a gallant knight,\" said the princess.\r\n\r\nThen to Danusia, she said:\r\n\r\n\"Take my place as the first person to-day; only do not laugh because it\r\nis not dignified.\"\r\n\r\nDanusia sat in the place of the lady; she wanted to be dignified, but her\r\nblue eyes were laughing at the kneeling Zbyszko, and she could not help\r\nmoving her feet from joy.\r\n\r\n\"Give him your gloves,\" said the princess.\r\n\r\nDanusia pulled off her gloves and handed them to Zbyszko who pressed them\r\nwith great respect to his lips, and said:\r\n\r\n\"I will fix them on my helmet and woe to the one who stretches his hands\r\nfor them!\"\r\n\r\nThen he kissed Danusia's hands and feet and arose. Then his dignity left\r\nhim, and great joy filled his heart because from that time the whole\r\ncourt would consider him a mature man. Therefore shaking Danusia's\r\ngloves, he began to shout, half mirthfully, half angrily:\r\n\r\n\"Come, you dog-brothers with peacock's crests, come!\"\r\n\r\nBut at that moment the same monk who had been there before entered the\r\ninn, and with him two superior ones. The servants of the monastery\r\ncarried willow baskets which contained bottles of wine and some tidbits.\r\nThe monks greeted the princess and again reproached her because she had\r\nnot gone directly to the abbey. She explained to them again, that having\r\nslept during the day, she was traveling at night for coolness; therefore\r\nshe did not need any sleep; and as she did not wish to awaken the worthy\r\nabbot nor the respectable monks, she preferred to stop in an inn to\r\nstretch her limbs.\r\n\r\nAfter many courteous words, it was finally agreed, that after matins and\r\nmass in the morning, the princess with her court would breakfast and rest\r\nin the monastery. The affable monks also invited the Mazurs, the two\r\nnoblemen and Macko of Bogdaniec who intended to go to the abbey to\r\ndeposit his wealth acquired in the war and increased by Witold's\r\nmunificent gift. This treasure was destined to redeem Bogdaniec from his\r\npledge. But the young Zbyszko did not hear the invitation, because he had\r\nrushed to his wagon which was guarded by his servants, to procure better\r\napparel for himself. He ordered his chests carried to a room in the inn\r\nand there he began to dress. At first he hastily combed his hair and put\r\nit in a silk net ornamented with amber beads, and in the front with real\r\npearls. Then he put on a \"_jaka_\" of white silk embroidered with golden\r\ngriffins; he girded himself with a golden belt from which was hanging a\r\nsmall sword in an ivory scabbard ornamented with gold. Everything was\r\nnew, shining and unspotted with blood, although it had been taken as\r\nbooty from a Fryzjan knight who served with the Knights of the Cross.\r\nThen Zbyszko put on beautiful trousers, one part having red and green\r\nstripes, the other part, yellow and purple, and both ended at the top\r\nlike a checkered chessboard. After that he put on red shoes with long\r\npoints. Fresh and handsome he went into the room.\r\n\r\nIn fact, as he stood in the door, his appearance made a great impression.\r\nThe princess seeing now what a handsome knight had vowed to Danusia, was\r\nstill more pleased. Danusia jumped toward him like a gazelle. But either\r\nthe beauty of the young man or the sounds of admiration from the\r\ncourtiers, caused her to pause before she reached him, drop her eyes\r\nsuddenly and blushing and confused, begin to wring her fingers.\r\n\r\nAfter her, came the others; the princess herself, the courtiers, the\r\nladies-in-waiting, the _rybalts_ and the monks all wanted to see him. The\r\nyoung Mazovian girls were looking at him as at a rainbow, each regretting\r\nthat he had not chosen her; the older ones admired the costly dress; and\r\nthus, a circle of curious ones was formed around him. Zbyszko stood in\r\nthe centre with a boastful smile on his youthful face, and turned himself\r\nslightly, so that they could see him better.\r\n\r\n\"Who is he?\" asked one of the monks.\r\n\r\n\"He is a knight, nephew of that _wlodyka_\" answered the princess,\r\npointing to Macko; \"he has made a vow to Danusia.\"\r\n\r\nThe monks did not show any surprise, because such a vow did not bind him\r\nto anything. Often vows were made to married women, and among the\r\npowerful families where the eastern custom was known, almost every woman\r\nhad a knight. If a knight made a vow to a young girl, he did not thus\r\nbecome her fiancé; on the contrary he usually married another; he was\r\nconstant to his vow, but did not hope to be wedded to her, but to marry\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nThe monks were more astonished at Danusia's youth, and even not much at\r\nthat, because in those times sixteen year old youths used to be\r\ncastellans. The great Queen Jadwiga herself, when she came from Hungary,\r\nwas only fifteen years old, and thirteen year old girls used to marry. At\r\nany rate, at that moment they were more occupied looking at Zbyszko than\r\nat Danusia; they also listened to Macko's words, who, proud of his\r\nnephew, was telling how the youth came in possession of such beautiful\r\nclothes.\r\n\r\n\"One year and nine weeks ago,\" said he, \"we were invited by the Saxon\r\nknights. There was another guest, a certain knight, from a far Fryzjan\r\nnation, who lived there on the shores of a sea. With him was his son who\r\nwas three years older than Zbyszko. Once at a banquet, that son began to\r\ntaunt Zbyszko because he has neither moustache nor beard. Zbyszko being\r\nquick tempered, was very angry, and immediately seized him by his\r\nmoustache, and pulled out all the hair. On account of that I afterward\r\nfought until death or slavery.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" asked the Pan of Dlugolas.\r\n\r\n\"Because the father took his son's part and I took Zbyszko's part;\r\ntherefore we fought, in the presence of the guests, on level ground. The\r\nagreement was, that the one who conquered, should take the wagons,\r\nhorses, servants and everything that belonged to the vanquished one. God\r\nhelped us. We killed those Fryzes, although with great labor, because\r\nthey were brave and strong. We took much valuable booty; there were four\r\nwagons, each one drawn by two horses, four enormous stallions, ten\r\nservants, and two excellent suits of armor which are difficult to find.\r\nIt is true we broke the helmets in the fight, but the Lord Jesus rewarded\r\nus with something else; there was a large chest of costly clothing; those\r\nin which Zbyszko is now dressed, we found there also.\"\r\n\r\nNow the two noblemen from the vicinity of Krakow, and all the Mazurs\r\nbegan to look with more respect on both the uncle and the nephew, and the\r\nPan of Dlugolas, called Obuch, said:\r\n\r\n\"I see you are terrible fellows, and not lazy.\"\r\n\r\n\"We now believe that this youngster will capture three peacocks' crests.\"\r\n\r\nMacko laughed, and in his face there really appeared an expression\r\nsimilar to that on the face of a beast of prey.\r\n\r\nBut in the meanwhile, the servants of the monastery had taken the wine\r\nand the dainties from the willow baskets, and the servant girls were\r\nbringing large dishes full of steaming boiled eggs, surrounded by\r\nsausage, from which a strong and savory smell filled the whole room. This\r\nsight excited everybody's appetite, and they rushed to the tables.\r\n\r\nBut nobody sat down until the princess was seated at the head of the\r\ntable; she told Zbyszko and Danusia to sit opposite her and then she said\r\nto Zbyszko:\r\n\r\n\"It is right for you both to eat from one dish; but do not step on her\r\nfeet under the table, nor touch her with your knees, as the other knights\r\ndo to their ladies, because she is too young.\"\r\n\r\nTo this he answered:\r\n\r\n\"I shall not do it, gracious lady, for two or three years yet, until the\r\nLord Jesus permits me to accomplish my vow, and then this little berry\r\nwill be ripe; as for stepping on her feet, even if I would like to do it\r\nI can not, because they do not touch the floor.\"\r\n\r\n\"True,\" answered the princess; \"but it is pleasant to see that you have\r\ngood manners.\"\r\n\r\nThen there was silence because everybody was busy eating. Zbyszko picked\r\nthe best pieces of sausage, which he handed to Danusia or put directly\r\ninto her mouth; she was glad that such a famous knight served her.\r\n\r\nAfter they had emptied the dishes, the servants of the monastery began to\r\npour out the sweet-smelling wine--abundantly for the men, but not much\r\nfor the ladies. Zbyszko's gallantry was particularly shown when they\r\nbrought in the nuts which had been sent from the monastery. There were\r\nhazel nuts and some very rare nuts imported from afar, called Italians;\r\nthey all feasted so willingly, that after awhile there was heard no sound\r\nin the whole room but the cracking of shells, crushed between the jaws.\r\nBut Zbyszko did not think only about himself; he preferred to show to the\r\nprincess and Danusia his knightly strength and abstinence. Therefore he\r\ndid not put the nuts between his jaws, as the others did, but he crushed\r\nthem between his fingers, and handed to Danusia the kernels picked from\r\nthe shells. He even invented for her an amusement; after having picked\r\nout the kernel, he placed his hand near his mouth and, with his powerful\r\nblowing, he blew the shells to the ceiling. Danusia laughed so much, that\r\nthe princess fearing that the young girl would choke, was obliged to ask\r\nhim to stop the amusement; but perceiving how merry the girl was, she\r\nasked her:\r\n\r\n\"Well, Danusia, is it good to have your own knight?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oj! Very!\" answered the girl.\r\n\r\nAnd then she touched Zbyszko's white silk \"_jaka_\" with her pink finger,\r\nand asked:\r\n\r\n\"And will he be mine to-morrow?\"\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow, and Sunday, and until death,\" answered Zbyszko.\r\n\r\nSupper lasted a long time, because after the nuts, sweet cakes with\r\nraisins were served. Some of the courtiers wished to dance; others wished\r\nto listen to the _rybalts_ or to Danusia's singing; but she was tired,\r\nand having with great confidence put her little head on the knight's\r\nshoulder, she fell asleep.\r\n\r\n\"Does she sleep?\" asked the princess. \"There you have your 'lady.'\"\r\n\r\n\"She is dearer to me while she sleeps than the others are while they\r\ndance,\" answered Zbyszko, sitting motionless so as not to awaken the\r\ngirl.\r\n\r\nBut she was awakened neither by the _rybalts_' music nor by the singing.\r\nSome of the courtiers stamped, others rattled the dishes in time to the\r\nmusic; but the greater the noise, the better she slept.\r\n\r\nShe awoke only when the roosters, beginning to crow, and the church bell\r\nto ring, the company all rushed from the benches, shouting:\r\n\r\n\"To matins! To matins!\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us go on foot for God's glory,\" said the princess.\r\n\r\nShe took the awakened Danusia by the hand and went out first, followed by\r\nthe whole court.\r\n\r\nThe night was beginning to whiten. In the east one could see a light\r\nglare, green at the top, then pink below, and under all a golden red,\r\nwhich extended while one looked at it. It seemed as though the moon was\r\nretreating before that glare. The light grew pinker and brighter. Moist\r\nwith dew, the rested and joyous world was awakening.\r\n\r\n\"God has given us fair weather, but there will be great heat,\" said the\r\ncourtiers.\r\n\r\n\"No matter,\" answered the Pan of Dlugolas; \"we will sleep in the abbey,\r\nand will reach Krakow toward evening.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure of a feast.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is a feast every day now, and after the confinement and\r\ntournaments, there will be still greater ones.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall see how Danusia's brave knight will acquit himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ej! They are of oak, those fellows! Did you hear what they said about\r\nthat fight for four knights on each side?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps they will join our court; they are consulting with each other\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\nIn fact, they were talking earnestly with each other; old Macko was not\r\nvery much pleased with what had happened; therefore while walking in the\r\nrear of the retinue, he said to his nephew:\r\n\r\n\"In truth, you don't need it. In some way I will reach the king and it\r\nmay be he will give us something. I would be very glad to get to some\r\ncastle or _grodek_[20]---- Well we shall see. We will redeem Bogdaniec\r\nfrom our pledge anyhow, because we must hold that which our forefathers\r\nheld. But how can we get some peasants to work? The land is worth nothing\r\nwithout peasants. Therefore listen to what I am going to tell you: if you\r\nmake vows or not to anyone you please, still you must go with the Pan of\r\nMielsztyn to Prince Witold against the Tartars. If they proclaim the\r\nexpedition by the sound of trumpets before the queen's confinement, then\r\ndo not wait either for the lying-in, or for the tournaments; only go,\r\nbecause there will be found some profit. Prince Witold is munificent, as\r\nyou know; and he knows you. If you acquit yourself well, he will reward\r\nyou liberally. Above all, if God help you, you will secure many slaves.\r\nThe Tartars swarm in the world. In case of victory, every knight will\r\ncapture three-score of them.\"\r\n\r\nAt this, Macko being covetous for land and serfs, began to fancy:\r\n\r\n\"If I could only catch fifty peasants and settle them in Bogdaniec! One\r\nwould be able to clear up quite a piece of forest. You know that nowhere\r\ncan you get as many as there.\"\r\n\r\nBut Zbyszko began to twist his head.\r\n\r\n\"Owa! I will bring hostlers from the stables living on horse carrion and\r\nnot accustomed to working on the land! What use will they be in\r\nBogdaniec? Then I vowed to capture three German crests. Where will I find\r\nthem among the Tartars?\"\r\n\r\n\"You made a vow because you were stupid; but your vow is not worth\r\nanything.\"\r\n\r\n\"But my honor of _wlodyka_ and knight? What about that?\"\r\n\r\n\"How was it with Ryngalla?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ryngalla poisoned the prince, and the hermit gave me absolution.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then in Tyniec, the abbot will absolve you from this vow also. The abbot\r\nis greater than a hermit.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want absolution!\"\r\n\r\nMacko stopped and asked with evident anger:\r\n\r\n\"Then how will it be?\"\r\n\r\n\"Go to Witold yourself, because I shall not go.\"\r\n\r\n\"You knave! And who will bow to the king? Don't you pity my bones?\"\r\n\r\n\"Even if a tree should fall on your bones, it would not crush them; and\r\neven if I pity you, I will not go to Witold.\"\r\n\r\n\"What will you do then? Will you turn _rybalt_ or falconer at the\r\nMazowiecki court?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's not a bad thing to be a falconer. But if you would rather grumble\r\nthan to listen to me, then grumble.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where will you go? Don't you care for Bogdaniec? Will you plow with your\r\nnails without peasants?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not true! You calculated cleverly about the Tartars! You have forgotten\r\nwhat the Rusini[21] told us, that it is difficult to catch any prisoners\r\namong the Tartars, because you cannot reach a Tartar on the steppes. On\r\nwhat will I chase them? On those heavy stallions that we captured from\r\nthe Germans? Do you see? And what booty can I take? Scabby sheep-skin\r\ncoats but nothing else! How rich then I shall return to Bogdaniec! Then\r\nthey will call me _comes_!\"\r\n\r\nMacko was silent because there was a great deal of truth in Zbyszko's\r\nwords; but after a while he said:\r\n\r\n\"But Prince Witold will reward you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah, you know; to one he gives too much, to another nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then tell me, where will you go?\"\r\n\r\n\"To Jurand of Spychow.\"\r\n\r\nMacko angrily twisted the belt of his leather jacket, and said:\r\n\r\n\"May you become a blind man!\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen,\" answered Zbyszko quietly. \"I had a talk with Mikolaj of\r\nDlugolas and he said that Jurand is seeking revenge on the Germans for\r\nthe death of his wife. I will go and help him. In the first place, you\r\nsaid yourself that it was nothing strange for us to fight the Germans\r\nbecause we know them and their ways so well. _Secundo_, I will thus more\r\neasily capture those peacock's crests; and _tercio_, you know that\r\npeacock's crests are not worn by knaves; therefore if the Lord Jesus will\r\nhelp me to secure the crests, it will also bring booty. Finally: the\r\nslaves from those parts are not like the Tartars. If you settle such\r\nslaves in a forest, then you will accomplish something.\"\r\n\r\n\"Man, are you crazy? There is no war at present and God knows when there\r\nwill be!\"\r\n\r\n\"How clever you are! The bears make peace with the bee-keepers and they\r\nneither spoil the beehives, nor eat the honey! Ha! ha! ha! Then it is\r\nnews to you, that although the great armies are not fighting and although\r\nthe king and the grand master stamped the parchment with their seals,\r\nstill there is always great disturbance on the frontiers? If some cattle\r\nare seized, they burn several villages for one cow's head and besiege the\r\ncastles. How about capturing peasants and their girls? About merchants on\r\nthe highways? Remember former times, about which you told me yourself.\r\nThat Nalencz, who captured forty knights going to join the Knights of the\r\nCross, and kept them in prison until the grand master sent him a cart\r\nfull of _grzywien_;[22] did he not do a good business? Jurand of Spychow\r\nis doing the same and on the frontier the work is always ready.\"\r\n\r\nFor a while they walked along silently; in the meanwhile, it was broad\r\ndaylight and the bright rays of the sun lighted up the rocks on which the\r\nabbey was built.\r\n\r\n\"God can give good luck in any place,\" Macko said, finally, with a calm\r\nvoice; \"pray that he may bless you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure; all depends on his favor!\"\r\n\r\n\"And think about Bogdaniec, because you cannot persuade me that you go to\r\nJurand of Spychow for the sake of Bogdaniec and not for that duck's\r\nbeak.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't speak that way, because it makes me angry. I will see her gladly\r\nand I do not deny it. Have you ever met a prettier girl?\"\r\n\r\n\"What do I care for her beauty! Better marry her, when she is grown up;\r\nshe is the daughter of a mighty _comes_.\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko's face brightened with a pleasant smile.\r\n\r\n\"It must be. No other lady, no other wife! When your bones are old, you\r\nshall play with the grandchildren born to her and myself.\"\r\n\r\nNow Macko smiled also and said:\r\n\r\n\"Grady! Grady![23]---- May they be as numerous as hail. When one is old,\r\nthey are his joy; and after death, his salvation. Jesus, grant us this!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nPrincess Danuta, Macko and Zbyszko had been in Tyniec before; but in the\r\ntrain of attendants there were some courtiers who now saw it for the\r\nfirst time; these greatly admired the magnificent abbey which was\r\nsurrounded by high walls built over the rocks and precipices, and stood\r\non a lofty mountain now shining in the golden rays of the rising sun. The\r\nstately walls and the buildings devoted to various purposes, the gardens\r\nsituated at the foot of the mountain and the carefully cultivated fields,\r\nshowed immediately the great wealth of the abbey. The people from poor\r\nMazowsze were amazed. It is true there were other mighty Benedictine\r\nabbeys in other parts of the country; as for instance in Lubusz on Odra,\r\nin Plock, in Wielkopolska, in Mogila and in several other places: but\r\nnone of them could compare with the abbey in Tyniec, which was richer\r\nthan many principalities, and had an income greater than even the kings\r\nof those times possessed.\r\n\r\nTherefore the astonishment increased among the courtiers and some of them\r\ncould scarcely believe their own eyes. In the meanwhile, the princess\r\nwishing to make the journey pleasant, and to interest the young ladies,\r\nbegged one of the monks to relate the awful story about Walgierz Wdaly\r\nwhich had been told to her in Krakow, although not very correctly.\r\n\r\nHearing this, the ladies surrounded the princess and walked slowly,\r\nlooking in the rays of the sun like moving flowers.\r\n\r\n\"Let Brother Hidulf tell about Walgierz, who appeared to him on a certain\r\nnight,\" said one of the monks, looking at one of the other monks who was\r\nan old man.\r\n\r\n\"Pious father, have you seen him with your own eyes?\" asked the princess.\r\n\r\n\"I have seen him,\" answered the monk gloomily; \"there are certain moments\r\nduring which, by God's will, he is permitted to leave the underground\r\nregions of hell and show himself to the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"When does it happen?\"\r\n\r\nThe old monk looked at the other monks and became silent. There was a\r\ntradition that the ghost of Walgierz appeared when the morals of the\r\nmonastic lives became corrupted, and when the monks thought more about\r\nworldly riches and pleasures than was right.\r\n\r\nNone of them, however, wished to tell this; but it was also said that the\r\nghost's appearance portended war or some other calamity. Brother Hidulf,\r\nafter a short silence, said:\r\n\r\n\"His appearance does not foretell any good fortune.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would not care to see him,\" said the princess, making the sign of the\r\ncross; \"but why is he in hell, if it is true as I heard, that he only\r\navenged a wrong?\"\r\n\r\n\"Had he been virtuous during his whole life,\" said the monk sternly, \"he\r\nwould be damned just the same because he was a heathen, and original sin\r\nwas not washed out by baptism.\"\r\n\r\nAfter those words the princess' brows contracted painfully because she\r\nrecollected that her father whom she loved dearly, had died in the\r\nheathen's errors also.\r\n\r\n\"We are listening,\" said she, after a short silence.\r\n\r\nBrother Hidulf began thus:\r\n\r\nDuring the time of heathenism, there was a mighty _grabia_[24] whose name\r\nwas Walgierz, whom on account of his great beauty, they called Wdaly.[25]\r\nThis whole country, as far as one can see, belonged to him, and he lead\r\nall the expeditions, the people on foot and a hundred spearmen who were\r\nall _wlodykas_; the men to the east as far as Opole, and to the west as\r\nfar as Sandomierz, were his vassals. Nobody was able to count his herds,\r\nand in Tyniec he had a towerful of money the same as the Knights of the\r\nCross have now in Marienburg.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, they have, I know it!\" interrupted the princess.\r\n\r\n\"He was a giant,\" continued the monk. \"He was so strong he could dig up\r\nan oak tree by the roots, and nobody in the whole world could compare\r\nwith him for beauty, playing on the lute or singing. One time when he was\r\nat the court of a French king, the king's daughter, Helgunda, fell in\r\nlove with him, and ran away with him to Tyniec, where they lived together\r\nin sin. No priest would marry them with Christian rites, because\r\nHelgunda's father had promised her to the cloister for the glory of God.\r\nAt the same time, there lived in Wislica, Wislaw Piekny,[26] who belonged\r\nto King Popiel's family. He, while Walgierz Wdaly was absent, devastated\r\nthe county around Tyniec. Walgierz when he returned overpowered Wislaw\r\nand imprisoned him in Tyniec. He did not take into consideration this\r\nfact: that every woman as soon as she saw Wislaw, was ready immediately\r\nto leave father, mother and even husband, if she could only satisfy her\r\npassion. This happened to Helgunda. She immediately devised such fetters\r\nfor Walgierz, that that giant, although he could pluck an oak up by its\r\nroots, was unable to break them. She gave him to Wislaw, who took and\r\nimprisoned him in Wislica. There Rynga, Wislaw's sister, having heard\r\nWalgierz singing in his underground cell, soon fell in love with him and\r\nset him at liberty. He then killed Wislaw and Helgunda with the sword,\r\nleft their bodies for the crows, and returned to Tyniec with Rynga.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was it not right, what he did?\" asked the princess.\r\n\r\nBrother Hidulf answered:\r\n\r\n\"Had he received baptism and given Tyniec to the Benedictines, perhaps\r\nGod would have forgiven his sins; but he did not do this, therefore the\r\nearth has devoured him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were the Benedictines in this kingdom at that time?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, the Benedictines were not here; only the heathen lived here then.\"\r\n\r\n\"How then could he receive baptism, or give up Tyniec?\"\r\n\r\n\"He could not; and that is exactly why he was sent to hell to endure\r\neternal torture,\" answered the monk with authority.\r\n\r\n\"Sure! He speaks rightly!\" several voices were heard to say.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile they approached the principal gate of the monastery,\r\nwhere the abbot with numerous monks and noblemen, was awaiting the\r\nprincess. There were always many lay people in the cloister: land\r\nstewards, barristers and procurators. Many noblemen, even powerful\r\n_wlodykas_, held in fief from the monastery numerous estates; and these,\r\nas \"vassals,\" were glad to pass their time at the court of their\r\n\"suzerain,\" where near the main altar it was easy to obtain some gift and\r\nmany benefits. Therefore the \"_abbas centum villarum_\"[27] could greet\r\nthe princess with a numerous retinue.\r\n\r\nHe was a man of great stature, with a thin, intelligent face; his head\r\nwas shaved on the top with a fringe of grey hair beneath. He had a deep\r\nscar on his forehead, which he had evidently received during his youth\r\nwhen he performed knightly deeds. His eyes looked penetratingly from\r\nbeneath dark eyebrows. He wore a monk's dress similar to that worn by the\r\nother monks, but over it he wore a black mantle, lined with purple;\r\naround his neck was a gold chain from which was hanging a gold cross set\r\nwith precious stones. His whole figure betrayed a proud man, accustomed\r\nto command and one who had confidence in himself.\r\n\r\nBut he greeted the princess affably and even humbly, because he\r\nremembered that her husband belonged to the family of the princes of\r\nMazowsze, from which came the kings, Wladyslaw and Kazimierz; and that\r\nher mother was the reigning queen of one of the most powerful kingdoms in\r\nthe world. Therefore he passed the threshold of the gate, bowed low, and\r\nthen having made the sign of the cross over Anna Danuta and over her\r\ncourt, he said;\r\n\r\n\"Welcome, gracious lady, to the threshold of this poor monastery. May\r\nSaint Benedictus of Nursja, Saint Maurus, Saint Bonifacius, Saint\r\nBenedictus of Aniane and also Jean of Tolomeia--our patrons living in\r\neternal glory,--give you health and happiness, and bless you seven times\r\na day during the remainder of your life.\"\r\n\r\n\"They would be deaf, if they did not hear the words of such a great\r\nabbot,\" said the princess affably; \"we came here to hear mass, during\r\nwhich we will place ourselves under their protection.\"\r\n\r\nHaving said this she stretched her hand toward him, which he falling upon\r\none knee, kissed in knightly manner. Then they passed through the gate.\r\nThe monks were waiting to celebrate mass, because immediately the bells\r\nwere rung; the trumpeters blew near the church door in honor of the\r\nprincess. Every church used to make a great impression on the princess\r\nwho had not been born in a Christian country. The church in Tyniec\r\nimpressed her greatly, because there were very few churches that could\r\nrival it in magnificence. Darkness filled the church except at the main\r\naltar where many lights were shining, brightening the carvings and\r\ngildings. A monk, dressed in a chasuble, came from the vestry, bowed to\r\nthe princess and commenced mass. Then the smoke from the fragrant incense\r\narose, veiled the priest and the altar, and mounted in quiet clouds to\r\nthe vaulted ceiling, increasing the solemn beauty of the church. Anna\r\nDanuta bent her head and prayed fervently. But when an organ, rare in\r\nthose times, began to shake the nave with majestic thunderings, filling\r\nit with angelic voices, then the princess raised her eyes, and her face\r\nexpressed, beside devotion and fear, a boundless delight; and one looking\r\nat her would take her for some saint, who sees in a marvelous vision, the\r\nopen heaven.\r\n\r\nThus prayed Kiejstut's daughter, who born in heathenism, in everyday life\r\nmentioned God's name just as everybody else did in those times,\r\nfamiliarly; but in the Lord's house she used to raise her eyes with fear\r\nand humility, toward his secret and unmeasurable power.\r\n\r\nThe whole court, although with less humility, prayed devoutly. Zbyszko\r\nknelt among the Mazurs, and committed himself to God's protection. From\r\ntime to time he glanced at Danusia who was sitting beside the princess;\r\nhe considered it an honor to be the knight of such a girl, and that his\r\nvow was not a trifle. He had already girded his sides with a hempen rope,\r\nbut this was only half of his vow; now it was necessary to fulfill the\r\nother half which was more difficult. Consequently now, when he was more\r\nserious than when in the inn drinking beer, he was anxious to discover\r\nhow he could fulfill it. There was no war. But amidst the disturbances on\r\nthe frontier, it was possible to meet some Germans, and either kill them\r\nor lay down his own life.\r\n\r\nHe had told this to Macko. But he thought: \"Not every German wears\r\npeacock or ostrich feathers on his helmet. Only a few among the guests of\r\nthe Knights of the Cross are counts, and the Knights of the Cross\r\nthemselves are only _comthurs_; and not every one of them is a _comthur_\r\neither. If there be no war, then years may pass before I shall get those\r\nthree crests; I have not been knighted yet and can challenge only those\r\nwho are not knights like myself. It is true I expect to receive the\r\ngirdle of a knight from the king's hands during the tournaments, which\r\nhave been announced to take place during the christening, but what will\r\nhappen then? I will go to Jurand of Spychow; he will help me kill as many\r\n_knechts_[28] as possible; but that will benefit me little. The _knechts_\r\nare not knights, with peacock feathers on their heads.\"\r\n\r\nTherefore in his uncertainty, seeing that without God's special favor, he\r\ncould do nothing, he began to pray:\r\n\r\n\"Jesus, grant a war between the Knights of the Cross and the Germans who\r\nare the foes of this kingdom and of all other nations confessing Your\r\nHoly Name. Bless us; but crush them who would rather serve the\r\n_starosta_[29] of hell, than serve you; they have hatred in their hearts\r\nagainst us, being angry because our king and queen, having baptized the\r\nLithuanians, forbade them cut your Christian servants with the sword. For\r\nwhich anger punish them!\"\r\n\r\n\"And I, Zbyszko a sinner, repent before you and from your five wounds\r\nbeseech for help, that in your mercy you permit me to kill as soon as\r\npossible three Germans having peacock feathers on their morions. These\r\ncrests I promised upon my knightly honor to Panna Anna Danuta, Jurand's\r\ndaughter, and your servant.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I shall find any booty on those defeated Germans, I shall faithfully\r\npay to holy church the tithe, in order that you also, sweet Jesus, may\r\nhave some benefit and glory through me; and also that you may know, that\r\nI promise to you with a sincere heart. As this is true, so help me,\r\namen!\"\r\n\r\nBut as he prayed, his heart softened under the influence of his devotions\r\nand he made another promise, which was that after having redeemed\r\nBogdaniec from its pledge, he would give to the church all the wax which\r\nthe bees could make during the whole year. He hoped that his Uncle Macko\r\nwould not make any opposition to this, and that the Lord Jesus would be\r\nespecially pleased with the wax for the candles, and wishing to get it,\r\nwould help him sooner. This thought seemed to him so right, that joy\r\nfilled his soul; and he was almost sure that his prayer would be heard\r\nand that the war would soon come, so that he could accomplish his vow. He\r\nfelt such might in his legs and in his arms, that at that moment he would\r\nhave attacked a whole army. He even thought that having increased his\r\npromises to God, he would also add for Danusia, a couple of Germans! His\r\nyouthful anger urged him to do it, but this time prudence prevailed, as\r\nhe was afraid to exhaust God's patience by asking too much.\r\n\r\nHis confidence increased, however, when after mass and a long rest, he\r\nheard the conversation between the abbot and Anna Danuta.\r\n\r\nThe wives of the reigning kings and princes, both on account of devotion\r\nas well as on account of the magnificent presents, sent them by the\r\nMaster of the Order, were very kindly disposed toward the Knights of the\r\nCross. Even the pious Jadwiga, as long as she lived, restrained her\r\nhusband's anger against them. Anna Danuta alone, having experienced\r\ndreadful wrongs from the knights hated them with her whole soul.\r\nTherefore when the abbot asked her about Mazowsze and its affairs, she\r\nbegan to complain bitterly against the Order:\r\n\r\n\"Our affairs are in a bad condition and it cannot be otherwise with such\r\nneighbors! Apparently it is the time of peace; they exchange ambassadors\r\nand letters, but notwithstanding all that nobody can be sure of anything.\r\nThe one who lives on the borders of the kingdom, never knows when he goes\r\nto bed in the evening, whether he will awaken in fetters, or with the\r\nblade of a sword in his throat, or with a burning ceiling over his head.\r\nNeither oaths, nor seals, nor parchment will protect from treachery. Thus\r\nit happened at Zlotorja where during the time of peace, they seized the\r\nprince and imprisoned him. The Knights of the Cross said that our castle\r\nwas a menace to them; but the castles are repaired for defence not for an\r\nonset; and what prince has not the right to build and repair in his own\r\nland? Neither the weak nor the powerful can agree with the Order, because\r\nthe knights despise the weak and try to ruin the mighty. Good deeds they\r\nrepay with evil ones. Is there anywhere in the world another order which\r\nhas received as many benefits from other kingdoms as the knights have\r\nreceived from Polish princes? And how have they repaid? With threats,\r\nwith devastation of our lands, with war and with treachery. And it is\r\nuseless to complain, even to our apostolic capital, because they do not\r\nlisten to the Roman pope himself. Apparently they have sent an embassy\r\nnow for the queen's confinement and the expected christening, but only\r\nbecause they wish to appease the anger of this mighty king for the evil\r\ndeeds they performed in Litwa. But in their hearts they are always\r\nplotting means to annihilate this kingdom and the whole Polish nation.\"\r\n\r\nThe abbot listened attentively with approval and then said:\r\n\r\n\"I know that Comthur Lichtenstein came to Krakow at the head of the\r\nembassy; he is very much respected in the Order for his bravery and\r\nintelligence. Perhaps you will see him here soon, gracious lady, because\r\nhe sent me a message yesterday, saying that as he wished to pray to our\r\nholy relics, he would pay a visit to Tyniec.\"\r\n\r\nHaving heard this, the princess began to complain again:\r\n\r\n\"The people say--and I am sure rightly--that there will soon be a great\r\nwar, in which on one side will be the kingdom of Poland and all the\r\nnations speaking a language similar to the Polish tongue, and on the\r\nother side will be all the Germans and the Order. There is a prophecy\r\nabout this war by some saint.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bridget,\" interrupted the scholarly abbot; \"eight years ago she was\r\ncanonized. The pious Peter from Alvastra and Matthew from Linköping have\r\nwritten her revelations, in which a great war has been predicted.\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko shuddered at these words, and not being able to restrain himself,\r\nasked:\r\n\r\n\"How soon will it be?\"\r\n\r\nBut the abbot being occupied with the princess, did not hear, or probably\r\ndid not wish to hear, the question.\r\n\r\nThe princess spoke further:\r\n\r\n\"Our young knights are glad that this war is coming, but the older and\r\nprudent ones speak thus: 'We are not afraid of the Germans, although\r\ntheir pride and power are great, but we are afraid of their relics,\r\nbecause against those all human might is powerless.'\"\r\n\r\nHere Anna Danuta looked at the abbot with fear and added in a softer\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n\"They say they have a true piece of the holy cross; how then can one\r\nfight against them?\"\r\n\r\n\"The French king sent it to them,\" answered the abbot.\r\n\r\nThere was a moment of silence, then Mikolaj of Dlugolas, called Obuch, a\r\nman of great experience, said:\r\n\r\n\"I was in captivity among the Knights of the Cross; I saw a procession in\r\nwhich they carried this great relic. But beside this, there are many\r\nother relics in the monastery in Oliva without which the order would not\r\nhave acquired such power.\"\r\n\r\nThe Benedictines stretched their necks toward the speaker, and began to\r\nask with great curiosity:\r\n\r\n\"Tell us, what are they?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is a piece of the dress of the Most Holy Virgin,\" answered the\r\n_wlodyka_ of Dlugolas; \"there is a molar tooth of Marya from Magdala and\r\nbranches from the bush in which God the Father revealed himself to Moses;\r\nthere is a hand of Saint Liberjus, and as for the bones of other saints,\r\nI cannot count them on the fingers of both hands and the toes of both\r\nfeet.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can one fight them?\" repeated the princess, sighing.\r\n\r\nThe abbot frowned, and having thought for awhile, said:\r\n\r\n\"It is difficult to fight them, for this reason; they are monks and they\r\nwear the cross on their mantles; but if they have exceeded the measure of\r\ntheir sins, then even those relics will refuse to remain with them; in\r\nthat case they will not strengthen the knights, but will take their\r\nstrength away, so that the relics can pass into more pious hands. May God\r\nspare Christian blood; but, if a great war should come, there are some\r\nrelics in our kingdom also which will succor us.\"\r\n\r\n\"May God help us!\" exclaimed Zbyszko.\r\n\r\nThe abbot turned toward the princess and said:\r\n\r\n\"Therefore have confidence in God, gracious lady, because their days are\r\nnumbered rather than yours. In the meanwhile, accept with grateful heart\r\nthis box, in which there is a finger of Saint Ptolomeus, one of our\r\npatrons.\"\r\n\r\nThe princess extended her hand and kneeling, accepted the box, which she\r\nimmediately pressed to her lips. The courtiers shared the joy of the\r\nlady. Zbyszko was happy because it seemed to him that war would come\r\nimmediately after the Krakowian festivals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nIt was in the afternoon that the princess left hospitable Tyniec and went\r\ntoward Krakow. Often the knights of those times, coming into larger\r\ncities or castles to visit some eminent person, used to put on their\r\nentire battle armor. It is true it was customary to take it off\r\nimmediately after they arrived at the gates; in fact it was the custom\r\nfor the host himself to invite them to remove it in these words: \"Take\r\noff your armor, noble lord; you have come to friends!\" This entrance was\r\nconsidered to be more dignified and to increase the importance of the\r\nknight. To conform with this ostentatious custom Macko and Zbyszko took\r\nwith them those excellent suits of armor and shoulder-bands--won from the\r\nconquered Fryzjan knights,--bright, shining and ornamented on the edges\r\nwith a gold band. Mikolaj of Dlugolas, who had seen the world and many\r\nknights, and was very expert in judging war things, immediately\r\nrecognized that the suits of armor had been made by a most famous armorer\r\nof Milan; armor which only the richest knights could afford; each of them\r\nbeing worth quite a fortune. He concluded that those Fryzes were mighty\r\nlords among their own people, and he looked with more respect on Macko\r\nand Zbyszko. Their helmets, although not common ones, were not so rich;\r\nbut their gigantic stallions, beautifully caparisoned, excited envy and\r\nadmiration among the courtiers. Macko and Zbyszko, sitting on very high\r\nsaddles, could look down proudly at the whole court. Each held in his\r\nhand a long spear; each had a sword at at his side and an axe at the\r\nsaddlebow. For the sake of comfort they had left their shields in the\r\nwagons, but even without them, both men looked as though they were going\r\nto battle and not to the city.\r\n\r\nBoth were riding near the carriage, in which was seated the princess,\r\naccompanied by Danusia, and in front of them a dignified court lady,\r\nOfka, the widow of Krystyn of Jarzombkow and the old Mikolaj of Dlugolas.\r\nDanusia looked with great interest at the two iron knights, and the\r\nprincess, pulling from time to time the box with the relics of Saint\r\nPtolomeus from her bosom, raised it to her lips.\r\n\r\n\"I am very anxious to see what bones are inside,\" said she, \"but I will\r\nnot open it myself, for I do not want to offend the saint; the bishop in\r\nKrakow will open it.\"\r\n\r\nTo this the cautious Mikolaj of Dlugolas answered:\r\n\r\n\"Ej, it will be better not to let this go out of your hands; it is too\r\nprecious a thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"May be you are right,\" said the princess, after a moment of reflection;\r\nthen she added:\r\n\r\n\"For a long time nobody has given me such pleasure, as this worthy abbot\r\nhas by this present; and he also calmed my fears about the relics of the\r\nKnights of the Cross.\"\r\n\r\n\"He spoke wisely and well,\" said Macko of Bogdaniec. \"At Wilno they also\r\nhad different relics, and they wanted to persuade the guests that they\r\nwere at war with the heathen. And what? Our knights noticed that if they\r\ncould only make a blow with an axe, immediately the helmet gave way and\r\nthe head fell down. The saints help--it would be a sin to say\r\ndifferently--but they only help the righteous, who go to war justly in\r\nGod's name. Therefore, gracious lady, I think that if there be another\r\nwar, even if all Germans help the Knights of the Cross, we will overcome\r\nthem, because our nation is greater and the Lord Jesus will give us more\r\nstrength in our bones. As for the relics,--have we not a true particle of\r\nthe holy cross in the monastery of Holy Cross?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is true, as God is dear to me,\" said the princess. \"But ours will\r\nremain in the monastery, while if necessary they carry theirs.\"\r\n\r\n\"No matter! There is no limit to God's power.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that true? Tell me; how is it?\" asked the princess, turning to the\r\nwise Mikolaj of Dlugolas; and he said:\r\n\r\n\"Every bishop will affirm it. Rome is distant too, and yet the pope rules\r\nover the whole world; cannot God do more!\"\r\n\r\nThese words soothed the princess so completely that she began to converse\r\nabout Tyniec and its magnificence. The Mazurs were astonished not only at\r\nthe riches of the abbey, but also at the wealth and beauty of the whole\r\ncountry through which they were now riding. All around were many\r\nflourishing villages; near them were orchards full of trees, linden\r\ngroves, storks' nests on the linden trees, and beneath the trees were\r\nbeehives with straw roofs. Along the highway on both sides, there were\r\nfields of all kinds of grain. From time to time, the wind bent the still\r\ngreenish sea of grain, amidst which shone like the stars in the sky, the\r\nblue heads of the flowers of the bachelor button, and the light red wild\r\npoppies. Far beyond the fields appeared the woods, black in the distance\r\nbut bathed in sunlight; here and there appeared moist meadows, full of\r\ngrass and birds flying round the bushes; then appeared hills with houses;\r\nagain fields; and as far as one could see, the country appeared to flow\r\nnot only with milk and honey but also with quiet and happiness.\r\n\r\n\"That is King Kazimierz' rural economy,\" said the princess; \"it must be a\r\npleasure to live here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lord Jesus rejoices to see such a country,\" answered Mikolaj of\r\nDlugolas; \"and God's blessing is over it; but how can it be different;\r\nwhen they ring the bells here, there is no corner where they cannot be\r\nheard! And it is known that no evil spirit can endure the ringing of the\r\nbells, and they are obliged to escape to the forests on the Hungarian\r\nfrontier.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder,\" said Pani Ofka, the widow of Krystyn of Jarzombkow, \"how\r\nWalgierz Wdaly, about whom the monk was talking, can appear in Tyniec,\r\nwhere they ring the bells seven times a day.\"\r\n\r\nThis remark embarrassed Mikolaj for a moment, who after thinking, quietly\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"In the first place, God's decrees are not well known; and then you must\r\nremember that every time he appears he has had special permission.\"\r\n\r\n\"At any rate, I am glad that we shall not pass the night in the\r\nmonastery. I would die from fear if I saw such an infernal giant.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hej! I doubt it, because they say, he is very handsome.\"\r\n\r\n\"If he were very beautiful, I would not want a kiss from such a man, from\r\nwhose mouth one could smell sulphur.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see that when the conversation is even about devils, you are still\r\nthinking about kisses.\"\r\n\r\nAt these words the princess, Pan Mikolaj and both _wlodykas_ of Bogdaniec\r\nbegan to laugh. Danusia laughed also, following the example of the\r\nothers. But Ofka of Jarzombkow turned her angry face toward Mikolaj of\r\nDlugolas, and said:\r\n\r\n\"I should prefer him to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ej! Don't call the wolf out of the forest;\" answered the merry Mazur;\r\n\"the ghost often wanders on the high road, between Krakow and Tyniec,\r\nespecially toward night; suppose he should hear you and appear to you in\r\nthe form of a giant!\"\r\n\r\n\"Let the enchantment go on the dog!\" answered Ofka.\r\n\r\nBut at that moment Macko of Bogdaniec, who being seated on a high\r\nstallion, could see further than those who were in the carriage, reined\r\nin his horse, and said:\r\n\r\n\"O, as God is dear to me, what is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"Some giant of the forest is coming!\"\r\n\r\n\"And the word became flesh!\" exclaimed the princess. \"Don't say that!\"\r\n\r\nBut Zbyszko arose in his stirrups and said:\r\n\r\n\"It is true; the giant Walgierz; nobody else!\"\r\n\r\nAt this the coachman reined in the horses, but not dropping the reins,\r\nbegan to make the sign of the cross, because he also perceived on an\r\nopposite hill the gigantic figure of a horsemen.\r\n\r\nThe princess had risen; but now she sat down, her face changed with fear.\r\nDanusia hid her face in the folds of the princess' dress. The courtiers,\r\nladies and _rybalts_, who were on horseback behind the carriage, having\r\nheard the ill-omened name, began to surround the carriage. The men tried\r\nto laugh, but there was fear in their eyes; the young girls were pale;\r\nonly Mikolaj of Dlugolas maintained his composure and wishing to\r\ntranquilize the princess, said:\r\n\r\n\"Don't be frightened, gracious lady. The sun has not yet set; and even if\r\nit were night, Saint Ptolomeus will manage Walgierz.\"\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, the unknown horseman, having mounted the top of the\r\nhill, stopped his horse and stood motionless. In the rays of the setting\r\nsun, one could see him very distinctly; his stature seemed greater than\r\nordinary human dimensions. The space separating him from the princess'\r\nretinue was not more than three hundred steps.\r\n\r\n\"Why is he stopping?\" asked one of the _rybalts_.\r\n\r\n\"Because we stopped,\" answered Macko.\r\n\r\n\"He is looking toward us as if he would like to choose somebody,\" said\r\nanother _rybalt_; \"if I were sure he was a man and not an evil spirit, I\r\nwould go and give him a blow on the head with the lute.\"\r\n\r\nThe women began to pray aloud, but Zbyszko wishing to show his courage to\r\nthe princess and Danusia, said:\r\n\r\n\"I will go just the same. I am not afraid of Walgierz!\"\r\n\r\nDanusia began to scream: \"Zbyszko! Zbyszko!\" But he went forward and rode\r\nswiftly, confident that even if he did meet the true Walgierz, he could\r\npierce him through and through with his spear.\r\n\r\nMacko who had sharp sight, said:\r\n\r\n\"He appears like a giant because he is on the hill. It is some big man,\r\nbut an ordinary one, nothing else! Owa! I am going also, to see that he\r\ndoes not quarrel with Zbyszko.\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko, while riding was debating whether he should immediately attack\r\nwith the spear, or whether first take a close view of the man standing on\r\nthe hill. He decided to view him first, and immediately persuaded himself\r\nthat it was the better thought, because as he approached, the stranger\r\nbegan to lose his extraordinary size. He was a large man and was mounted\r\non a large horse, which was bigger than Zbyszko's stallion; yet he did\r\nnot exceed human size. Besides that he was without armor, with a velvet\r\ncap shaped like a bell on his head; he wore a white linen dust cloak,\r\nfrom beneath which a green dress could be seen. While standing on the\r\nhill he was praying. Evidently he had stopped his horse to finish his\r\nevening devotions.\r\n\r\n\"It is not Walgierz,\" thought the boy.\r\n\r\nHe had approached so close that he could touch the unknown man with his\r\nspear. The man who evidently was a knight, smiled at him benevolently,\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n\"May Jesus Christ be praised!\"\r\n\r\n\"For ages and ages.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that the court of the Princess of Mazowsze below?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you come from Tyniec?\"\r\n\r\nBut he did not receive any answer, because Zbyszko was so much surprised\r\nthat he did not even hear the question. For a moment he stood like a\r\nstatue, scarcely believing his own eyes, for, behold! about half a\r\nfurlong behind the unknown man, he perceived several soldiers on\r\nhorseback, at the head of whom was riding a knight clad in full armor,\r\nwith a white cloth mantle with a red cross on it, and with a steel helmet\r\nhaving a magnificent peacock tuft in the crest.\r\n\r\n\"A Knight of the Cross!\" whispered Zbyszko. Now he thought that God had\r\nheard his prayers; that he had sent him the German knight for whom he had\r\nasked in Tyniec. Surely he must take advantage of God's kindness;\r\ntherefore without any hesitation,--before all these thoughts had hardly\r\npassed through his head, before his astonishment had diminished,--he bent\r\nlow on the saddle, let down his spear and having uttered his family\r\nshout: \"Grady! Grady!\" he rushed with the whole speed of his horse\r\nagainst the Knight of the Cross.\r\n\r\nThat knight was astonished also; he stopped his horse, and without\r\nlowering his spear, looked in front of him, uncertain whether the attack\r\nwas against him or not.\r\n\r\n\"Lower your spear!\" shouted Zbyszko, pricking his horse with the iron\r\npoints of the stirrups.\r\n\r\n\"Grady! Grady!\"\r\n\r\nThe distance separating them began to diminish. The Knight of the Cross\r\nseeing that the attack was really against him, reined in his horse and\r\npoised his spear. At the moment that Zbyszko's lance was nearly touching\r\nhis chest, a powerful hand broke it like a reed; then the same hand\r\nreined in Zbyszko's horse with such force, that the charger stopped as\r\nthough rooted to the ground.\r\n\r\n\"You crazy man, what are you doing?\" said a deep, threatening voice; \"you\r\nare attacking an envoy, you are insulting the king!\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko glanced around and recognized the same gigantic man, whom he had\r\ntaken for Walgierz, and who had frightened the princess and her court.\r\n\r\n\"Let me go against the German! Who are you?\" he cried, seizing his axe.\r\n\r\n\"Away with the axe! for God's sake! Away with the axe, I say! I will\r\nthrow you from your horse!\" shouted the stranger more threateningly. \"You\r\nhave offended the majesty of the king and you will be punished.\"\r\n\r\nThen he turned toward the soldiers who were riding behind the Knight of\r\nthe Cross.\r\n\r\n\"Come here!\"\r\n\r\n\"At this time Macko appeared and his face looked threatening. He\r\nunderstood that Zbyszko had acted like a madman and that the consequences\r\nof this affair might be very serious; but he was ready to defend him just\r\nthe same. The whole retinue of the stranger and of the Knight of the\r\nCross contained only fifteen men, armed with spears and crossbows;\r\ntherefore two knights in full armors could fight them with some hope of\r\nbeing victorious. Macko also thought that as they were threatened with\r\npunishment, it would be better perhaps to avoid it, by overcoming these\r\nmen, and then hiding somewhere until the storm had passed over. Therefore\r\nhis face immediately contracted, like the jaws of a wolf ready to bite,\r\nand having pushed his horse between Zbyszko and the stranger's horse, he\r\nbegan to ask, meanwhile handling his sword:\r\n\r\n\"Who are you? What right have you to interfere?\"\r\n\r\n\"My right is this,\" said the stranger, \"that the king has intrusted to me\r\nthe safety of the environs of Krakow, and they call me Powala of Taczew.\"\r\n\r\nAt these words, Macko and Zbyszko glanced at the knight, then returned to\r\ntheir scabbards the half drawn swords and dropped their heads, not\r\nbecause they were frightened but in respect for this famous and very\r\nwell-known name. Powala of Taczew, a nobleman of a powerful family and a\r\nmighty lord, possessor of large estates round Radom, was at the same time\r\none of the most famous knights in the kingdom. _Rybalts_ sang about him\r\nin their songs, citing him as an example of honor and gallantry, praising\r\nhis name as much as the names of Zawisza of Garbow and Farurej, Skarbek\r\nof Gora, Dobek of Olesnica, Janko Nanszan, Mikolaj of Moskorzowo, and\r\nZandram of Maszkowic. At this moment he was the representative of the\r\nking, therefore to attack him was to put one's head under the\r\nexecutioner's axe.\r\n\r\nMacko becoming cooler, said with deep respect:\r\n\r\n\"Honor and respect to you, sir, to your fame and to your gallantry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Honor to you also, sir,\" answered Powala; \"but I would prefer to make\r\nyour acquaintance under less serious circumstances.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" asked Macko.\r\n\r\nPowala turned toward Zbyszko.\r\n\r\n\"What have you done, you youngster? You attacked an envoy on the public\r\nhighway in the king's presence! Do you know the consequences of such an\r\nact?\"\r\n\r\n\"He attacked the envoy because he was young and stupid; therefore action\r\nwas easier for him than reflection,\" said Macko. \"But you will not judge\r\nhim so severely, after I tell you the whole story.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not I who will judge him. My business is only to put him in\r\nfetters.\"\r\n\r\n\"How is that?\" said Macko, looking gloomy again.\r\n\r\n\"According to the king's command.\"\r\n\r\nSilence followed these words.\r\n\r\n\"He is a nobleman,\" said Macko finally.\r\n\r\n\"Let him swear then upon his knightly honor, that he will appear at the\r\ncourt.\"\r\n\r\n\"I swear!\" exclaimed Zbyszko.\r\n\r\n\"Very well. What do they call you?\"\r\n\r\nMacko mentioned the name and the coat of arms of his nephew.\r\n\r\n\"If you belong to Princess Janusz' court, beg her to intercede for you\r\nwith the king.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are not with her court. We are returning from Litwa, from Prince\r\nWitold. Better for us if we had never met any court! This misfortune has\r\ncome from that.\"\r\n\r\nHere Macko began to tell about what had happened in the inn; he spoke\r\nabout the meeting with the princess and about Zbyszko's vow. Then\r\nsuddenly he was filled with anger against Zbyszko, whose imprudence had\r\ncaused their present dreadful plight; therefore, turning toward him, he\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"I would have preferred to see you dead at Wilno! What have you done, you\r\nyoung of a wild boar!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Zbyszko, \"after the vow, I prayed to the Lord Jesus to give\r\nme some Germans; I promised him a present; therefore when I perceived the\r\npeacock feathers, and also a mantle embroidered with a cross, immediately\r\nsome voice cried within me: 'Strike the German! It is a miracle!' Well I\r\nrushed forward then; who would not have done it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen,\" interrupted Powala, \"I do not wish you any evil. I see clearly\r\nthat this youngster sinned rather from youthful giddiness than from\r\nmalice. I will be only too glad to ignore his deed and go forward as if\r\nnothing had happened. But I cannot do this unless that _comthur_ will\r\npromise that he will not complain to the king. Beseech him; perhaps he\r\nalso will pity the lad.\"\r\n\r\n\"I prefer to go before the courts, than to bow to a _Krzyzak_!\"[30]\r\nexclaimed Zbyszko. \"It would not be befitting my dignity as a _wlodyka_.\"\r\n\r\nPowala of Taczew looked at him severely and said:\r\n\r\n\"You do not act wisely. Old people know better than you, what is right\r\nand what is befitting a knight's dignity. People have heard about me; but\r\nI tell you, that if I had acted as you have, I would not be ashamed to\r\nask forgiveness for such an offence.\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko felt ashamed; but having glanced around, answered:\r\n\r\n\"The ground is level here. Instead of asking him for forgiveness, I would\r\nprefer to fight him on horseback or on foot, till death or slavery.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are stupid!\" interrupted Macko. \"You wish then to fight the envoy?\"\r\n\r\nHere he turned to Powala:\r\n\r\n\"You must excuse him, noble lord. He became wild during the war. It will\r\nbe better if he does not speak to the German, because he may insult him.\r\nI will do it. I will entreat him to forgive. If this _comthur_ be willing\r\nto settle it by combat, after his mission is over, I will meet him.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is a knight of a great family; he will not encounter everybody,\"\r\nanswered Powala.\r\n\r\n\"What? Do I not wear a girdle and spurs? Even a prince may meet me.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true; but do not tell him that, unless he mentions it himself; I\r\nam afraid he will become angry if you do. Well, may God help you!\"\r\n\r\n\"I am going to humiliate myself for your sake,\" said Macko to Zbyszko;\r\n\"wait awhile!\"\r\n\r\nHe approached the Knight of the Cross who had remained motionless on his\r\nenormous stallion, looking like an iron statue, and had listened with the\r\ngreatest indifference to the preceding conversation. Macko having learned\r\nGerman during the long wars, began to explain to the _comthur_ in his own\r\nlanguage what had happened; he excused the boy on account of his youth\r\nand violent temper, and said that it had seemed to the boy as though God\r\nhimself had sent the knight wearing a peacock tuft, and finally he begged\r\nforgiveness for the offence.\r\n\r\nThe _comthur's_ face did not move. Calm and haughty he looked at Macko\r\nwith his steely eyes with great indifference, but also with great\r\ncontempt. The _wlodyka_ of Bogdaniec noticed this. His words continued to\r\nbe courteous but his soul began to rebel. He talked with increasing\r\nconstraint and his swarthy face flushed. It was evident that in the\r\npresence of this haughty pride, Macko was endeavoring to restrain his\r\nanger.\r\n\r\nPowala having noticed this, and having a kind heart, determined to help\r\nMacko. He had learned to speak German while seeking knightly adventures\r\nat the Hungarian, Burgundian and Bohemian courts, when he was young.\r\nTherefore he now said in that language in a conciliatory but jesting\r\ntone:\r\n\r\n\"You see, sir, the noble _comthur_ thinks that the whole affair is\r\nunimportant. Not only in our kingdom but in every country the youths are\r\nslightly crazy; but such a noble knight does not fight children, neither\r\nby sword nor by law.\"\r\n\r\nLichtenstein touched his yellow moustache and moved on without a word,\r\npassing Macko and Zbyszko.\r\n\r\nA dreadful wrath began to raise the hair under their helmets, and their\r\nhands grasped their swords.\r\n\r\n\"Wait, you scoundrel!\" said the elder _wlodyka_ through his set teeth;\r\n\"now I will make a vow to you. I will seek you as soon as you have\r\nfinished your mission.\"\r\n\r\nBut Powala, whose heart began to bleed also, said:\r\n\r\n\"Wait! Now the princess must speak in favor of the boy; otherwise, woe to\r\nhim!\"\r\n\r\nHaving said this, he followed the Knight of the Cross, stopped him and\r\nfor a while they talked with great animation. Macko and Zbyszko noticed\r\nthat the German knight did not look at Powala so proudly as he had at\r\nthem; this made them still more angry. After a while, Powala returned and\r\nsaid to them:\r\n\r\n\"I tried to intercede for you, but he is a hard man. He said that he\r\nwould not complain to the king if you would do what he requires.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"He said thus: 'I will stop to greet the Princess of Mazowsze; let them\r\ncome, dismount, take off their helmets, and standing on the ground with\r\nuncovered heads, ask my forgiveness.'\"\r\n\r\nHere Powala looked sharply at Zbyszko, and added:\r\n\r\n\"I know it will be hard for people of noble birth to do this; but I must\r\nwarn you, that if you refuse no one knows what you may expect,--perhaps\r\nthe executioner's sword.\"\r\n\r\nThe faces of Macko and Zbyszko became like stone. There was silence.\r\n\r\n\"What then?\" asked Powala.\r\n\r\nZbyszko answered quietly and with great dignity as though during this\r\nconversation he had grown twenty years older:\r\n\r\n\"Well, God's might is over all!\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean, that even if I had two heads and the executioner was going to\r\ncut off both, still I have only one honor which I will not stain.\"\r\n\r\nPowala became grave and turning toward Macko, asked:\r\n\r\n\"And what do you say?\"\r\n\r\n\"I say,\" answered Macko gloomily, \"that I reared this youth from\r\nchildhood. On him depends our family, because I am old; but he cannot do\r\nwhat the German asks, even if he must perish.\"\r\n\r\nHere his grim face began to quiver and finally his love for his nephew\r\nburst forth with such strength, that he seized the boy in his arms, and\r\nbegan to shout:\r\n\r\n\"Zbyszku! Zbyszku!\"[31]\r\n\r\nThe young knight was surprised and having returned his uncle's embrace,\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Aj! I did not know that you loved me so much.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see that you are both true knights,\" said Powala; \"and as the young\r\nman has promised me upon his knightly honor, that he will appear at the\r\ncourt, I will not imprison him; one can trust such people as you. No more\r\ngloomy thoughts! The German intends to stay in Tyniec a day or two;\r\ntherefore I will have an opportunity to see the king first, and I will\r\ntry to tell him about this affair in such a way that his anger will not\r\nbe aroused. I am glad I succeeded in breaking the spear in time,--great\r\nluck, I tell you!\"\r\n\r\nBut Zbyszko said:\r\n\r\n\"Even if I had to lay down my life, I would like at least to have the\r\nsatisfaction of breaking his bones.\"\r\n\r\n\"It surprises me that you who know how to defend your own honor, do not\r\nunderstand that you would thus disgrace our whole nation!\" impatiently\r\nanswered Powala.\r\n\r\n\"I understand it very well,\" said Zbyszko; \"but I regret my disability\r\njust the same.\"\r\n\r\nPowala turned toward Macko:\r\n\r\n\"Do you know, sir, that if this lad succeeds in escaping the penalty for\r\nhis offence, then you ought to put a cowl like a hawk's on his head!\r\nOtherwise he will not die a natural death.\"\r\n\r\n\"He will escape if you, sir, will not say anything to the king about the\r\noccurrence.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what shall we do with the German? We cannot tie his tongue.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true! That is true!\"\r\n\r\nTalking thus, they went back toward the princess' retinue. Powala's\r\nservants followed them. From afar one could see amidst the Mazovian caps,\r\nthe quivering peacock feathers of the Knight of the Cross and his bright\r\nhelmet shining in the sun.\r\n\r\n\"Strange is the nature of a _Krzyzak_,\" said the knight of Taczew. \"When\r\na _Krzyzak_ is in a tight place, he will be as forbearing as a Franciscan\r\nmonk, as humble as a lamb and as sweet as honey; in fact, it would be\r\ndifficult to find a better man. But let him feel power behind him; then\r\nnobody will be more arrogant and merciless. It is evident that God gave\r\nthem stones for hearts. I have seen many different nations and I have\r\noften witnessed a true knight spare another who was weaker, saying to\r\nhimself; 'My fame will not increase if I trample this fallen foe.' But at\r\nsuch a time a _Krzyzak_ is implacable. Hold him by the throat, otherwise\r\nwoe to you! Such a man is that envoy! He wanted not only an apology, but\r\nalso your humiliation. But I am glad he failed.\"\r\n\r\n\"He can wait!\" exclaimed Zbyszko.\r\n\r\n\"Be careful not to show him that you are troubled, because then he would\r\nrejoice.\"\r\n\r\nAfter these words they approached the retinue and joined the princess'\r\ncourt. The envoy of the _Krzyzaks_, having noticed them, immediately\r\nassumed an expression of pride and disdain; but they ignored him. Zbyszko\r\nstood at Danusia's side and began to tell her that from the hill one\r\ncould see Krakow; at the same time Macko was telling one of the _rybalts_\r\nabout the extraordinary strength of the Pan of Taczew, who had broken the\r\nspear in Zbyszko's hand, as though it were a dry stem.\r\n\r\n\"And why did he break it?\" asked the _rybalt_.\r\n\r\n\"Because the boy in fun attacked the German.\"\r\n\r\nThe _rybalt_, being a nobleman, did not consider such an attack a joke;\r\nbut seeing that Macko spoke about it lightly, did not take it seriously\r\neither. The German was annoyed by such conduct. He glanced at Macko and\r\nZbyszko. Finally be realized that they did not intend to dismount and\r\nthat they did not propose to pay any attention to him. Then something\r\nlike steel shone in his eyes, and he immediately began to bid the\r\nprincess adieu.\r\n\r\nThe Lord of Taczew could not abstain from deriding him and at the moment\r\nof departure he said to him:\r\n\r\n\"Go without fear, brave knight. The country is quiet and nobody will\r\nattack you, except some careless child.\"\r\n\r\n\"Although the customs of this country are strange, I was seeking your\r\ncompany and not your protection,\" answered Lichtenstein; \"I expect to\r\nmeet you again at the court and elsewhere.\"\r\n\r\nIn the last words a hidden menace rang; therefore Powala answered\r\ngravely:\r\n\r\n\"If God will permit.\"\r\n\r\nHaving said this, he saluted and turned away; then he shrugged his\r\nshoulders and said in an undertone, but loud enough to be heard by those\r\nwho were near:\r\n\r\n\"Gaunt! I could lift you from the saddle with the point of my spear, and\r\nhold you in the air during three _pater-nosters_.\"[32]\r\n\r\nThen he began to talk with the princess with whom he was very well\r\nacquainted. Anna Danuta asked him what he was doing on the highway. He\r\ntold her that the king had commanded him to keep order in the environs\r\nwhile there were so many wealthy guests going to Krakow. Then he told her\r\nabout Zbyszko's foolish conduct. But having concluded that there would be\r\nplenty of time to ask the princess to protect Zbyszko, he did not put any\r\nstress on the incident, not wishing to spoil the gaiety. The princess\r\nlaughed at the boy, because he was so anxious to obtain the peacock tuft;\r\nthe others, having learned about the breaking of the spear, admired the\r\nLord of Taczew very much, especially as he did it with one hand only.\r\n\r\nAnd he, being a little vain, was pleased because they praised him.\r\nFinally he began to tell about some of the exploits which made his name\r\nfamous; especially those he performed in Burgundia, at the court of\r\nPhilip the Courageous. There one time, during a tournament, he seized an\r\nArdenian knight, pulled him out of the saddle and threw him in the air,\r\nnotwithstanding that the knight was in full armor. For that exploit,\r\nPhilip the Courageous presented him with a gold chain and the queen gave\r\nhim a velvet slipper, which he wore on his helmet.\r\n\r\nUpon hearing this, all were very much amazed, except Mikolaj of Dlugolas,\r\nwho said:\r\n\r\n\"In these effeminate times, there are not such strong men as there were\r\nwhen I was young. If a nobleman now happens to shatter a cuirass, to bend\r\na crossbow without the aid of the crank, or to bend a cutlass between his\r\nfingers, he immediately considers himself a very strong man. But in times\r\nof yore, girls could do such deeds.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't deny that formerly there were stronger people,\" answered Powala;\r\n\"but even now there are some strong men. God did not stint me in\r\nstrength, but I do not consider myself the strongest in this kingdom.\r\nHave you ever seen Zawisza of Garbow? He can surpass me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have seen him. He has shoulders broad like a rampart.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Dobko of Olesnica? Once at the tournament given in Torun by the\r\nKnights of the Cross, he defeated twelve knights for his own and our\r\nnation's glory.\"\r\n\r\n\"But our Mazur, Staszko Ciolek, was stronger, sir, than you or your\r\nZawisza and Dobko. They say that he took a peg made from green wood in\r\nhis hand and pressed the sap out of it.\"[33]\r\n\r\n\"I can press the sap out myself,\" said Zbyszko. And before anyone could\r\nask him to prove it, he broke a branch which he pressed so strongly, that\r\nreally the sap began to ooze from it.\r\n\r\n\"Aj, Jesus!\" exclaimed Ofka of Jarzombkow; \"don't go to the war; it would\r\nbe a pity if such an one should perish before his marriage.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would indeed be a pity!\" replied Macko, suddenly becoming sorrowful.\r\n\r\nBut Mikolaj of Dlugolas laughed as did also the princess. The others,\r\nhowever, praised Zbyszko's strength, and as in those times might was\r\nappreciated more than any other quality, the young girls cried to\r\nDanusia: \"Be glad!\" She was glad although she could not then understand\r\nwhat benefit she would receive from that piece of compressed wood.\r\nZbyszko having forgotten all about the _Krzyzak_ now looked so proud,\r\nthat Mikolaj of Dlugolas wishing to curb his pride, said:\r\n\r\n\"There are better men than you; therefore do not be so proud of your\r\nstrength. I did not see it, but my father was a witness of something more\r\ndifficult which happened at the court of Charles, the Roman emperor. King\r\nKazimierz went to pay him a visit and with him went many courtiers. Among\r\nthese courtiers was Staszko Ciolek, son of _Wojewoda_[34] Andrzej, who\r\nwas noted for his strength. The emperor began to boast that he had a\r\nCzech who could strangle a bear. They had an exhibition and the Czech\r\nstrangled two bears in succession. Our king not wishing to be outdone,\r\nsaid: 'But he cannot overcome my Ciolek.' They agreed that they should\r\nfight in three days' time. Many ladies and famous knights came, and the\r\nCzech and Ciolek grappled in the yard of the castle; but the contest did\r\nnot last long; hardly had they come together before Ciolek broke the\r\nbackbone of the Czech, crushed all his ribs, and left him dead to the\r\ngreat glory of the king.[35] They have called him since then\r\nLomignat.[36] Once he placed without help, a bell which twelve men could\r\nnot move from its place.\"[37]\r\n\r\n\"How old was he?\" asked Zbyszko.\r\n\r\n\"He was young!\"\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Powala of Taczew, while riding at the princess' right\r\nhand, bent toward her and told her the truth about the importance of\r\nZbyszko's adventure, and asked her to speak to the king in Zbyszko's\r\nbehalf. The princess being fond of Zbyszko, received this news with\r\nsadness and became very uneasy.\r\n\r\n\"The Bishop of Krakow is a friend of mine,\" said Powala; \"I will ask him\r\nand also the queen to intercede; but the more protectors he has, the\r\nbetter it will be for the lad.\"\r\n\r\n\"If the queen will promise to say one word in his favor, not a hair will\r\nfall from his head,\" said Anna Danuta; \"the king worships her for her\r\npiety and for her dowry, and especially now, when the shame of sterility\r\nhas been taken from her. But the king's beloved sister, Princess Ziemowit\r\nlives in Krakow; you must go to her. For my part I will do anything I\r\ncan; but the princess is his own sister, and I am only his first cousin.\"\r\n\r\n\"The king loves you also, gracious lady.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ej, but not as much,\" she answered with a certain sadness; \"for me a\r\nlink, for her a whole chain; for me a fox skin, for her a sable. He loves\r\nnone of his relations as dearly as he loves Alexandra.\"\r\n\r\nThus talking, they approached Krakow. The highway which was crowded on\r\nthe road from Tyniec, was still more crowded here. They met countrymen\r\ngoing with their servants to the city, sometimes armed and sometimes in\r\nsummer clothing and straw hats. Some of them were on horseback; some\r\ntraveled in carriages, with their wives and daughters, who wished to see\r\nthe long looked for tournaments. In some places the whole road was\r\ncrowded with merchants' wagons which could not pass Krakow until the toll\r\nwas paid. They carried in these wagons wax, grain, salt, fish, skins,\r\nhemp and wood. Others came from the city loaded with cloth, barrels of\r\nbeer and different merchandise. One could now see Krakow very well; the\r\nking's gardens, lords' and burghers' houses surrounded the city; beyond\r\nthem were the walls and the towers of the churches. The nearer they came\r\nto the city the greater was the traffic and at the gates it was almost\r\nimpossible to pass.\r\n\r\n\"What a city! There is no other like it in the world,\" said Macko.\r\n\r\n\"It is always like a fair,\" answered one of the _rybalts_; \"how long\r\nsince you were here, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"A very long time ago. I wonder at it just as much as if I saw it now for\r\nthe first time, because we are returning from a wild country.\"\r\n\r\n\"They say that Krakow has grown very much since the time of King\r\nJagiello.\"\r\n\r\nThis was true; after the grand duke of Litwa ascended the throne,\r\nenormous Lithuanian and Russian countries were opened for commerce;\r\nbecause of this the city had increased in population, richness and\r\nbuildings, and had become one of the most important cities in the world.\r\n\r\n\"The cities of the Knights of the Cross are very beautiful also,\" said\r\nthe larger _rybalt_.\r\n\r\n\"If only we could capture one of them,\" said Macko. \"Worthy booty we\r\ncould get!\"\r\n\r\nBut Powala of Taczew was thinking about something else; namely, of\r\nZbyszko, who was in peril because of his stupid blind fury. The Pan of\r\nTaczew, fierce and implacable in the time of war, had in his powerful\r\nbreast, however, the heart of a dove; he realized better than the others\r\nwhat punishment awaited the offender; therefore he pitied him.\r\n\r\n\"I ponder and ponder,\" said he again to the princess, \"whether to tell\r\nthe king of the incident or not. If the _Krzyzak_ does not complain,\r\nthere will be no case; but if he should complain, perhaps it would be\r\nbetter to tell the king everything beforehand, so that he will not become\r\nangry.\"\r\n\r\n\"If the _Krzyzak_ has an opportunity to ruin somebody, he will do it,\"\r\nanswered the princess; \"but I will tell that young man to join our court.\r\nPerhaps the king will be more lenient to one of our courtiers.\"\r\n\r\nShe called Zbyszko, who having had his position explained to him, jumped\r\nfrom his horse, kissed her hands and became with the greatest pleasure\r\none of her courtiers, not so much for greater safety, as because he could\r\nnow remain nearer Danusia.\r\n\r\nPowala asked Macko:\r\n\r\n\"Where will you stay?\"\r\n\r\n\"In an inn.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no room in any inn now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we will go to merchant Amylej, he is an acquaintance of mine,\r\nperhaps he will let us pass the night in his house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Accept hospitality in my house. Your nephew can stay with the princess'\r\ncourtiers in the castle; but it will be better for him not to be near the\r\nking. What one does in the first paroxysm of anger, one would not do\r\nafterward. You will be more comfortable and safe with me.\"\r\n\r\nMacko had become uneasy because Powala thought so much about their\r\nsafety; he thanked Powala with gratitude and they entered the city. But\r\nhere they both as well as Zbyszko forgot for a while about danger in the\r\npresence of the wonders they saw before them. In Lithuania and on the\r\nfrontier, they had only seen single castles, and the only city of any\r\nimportance which they knew was Wilno, a badly built and ruined town; but\r\nhere many of the merchants' houses were more magnificent than the grand\r\nduke's palace in Lithuania. It is true that there were many wooden\r\nhouses; but even these astonished them by the loftiness of their walls\r\nand roofs; also by the windows, made of glass balls, set in lead which so\r\nreflected the rays of the setting sun, that one would imagine that there\r\nwas fire in the houses. In the streets near the market place, there were\r\nmany highly ornamented houses of red brick, or of stone. They stood side\r\nby side like soldiers; some of them, broad; others, narrow; but all lofty\r\nwith vaulted halls, very often having the sign of the Passion of our Lord\r\nJesus Christ or an image of the Most Holy Virgin over the door. There\r\nwere some streets, on which one could see two rows of houses, over them a\r\nstripe of blue sky, between them, a road paved with stones; and on both\r\nsides as far as one could see stores and stores. These were full of the\r\nbest foreign goods, at which being accustomed to war and the capture of\r\nbooty, Macko looked with a longing eye. But both were still more\r\nastonished at the sight of the public buildings; the church of Panna\r\nMaryia on the square; the _sukiennice_;[38] the city hall with its\r\ngigantic cellar, in which they were selling beer from Swidnica; other\r\nchurches, depots of broadcloth, the enormous \"_mercatorium_,\" devoted to\r\nthe use of foreign merchants; then a building in which were the public\r\nscales, bath houses, cooper works, wax works, silver works, gold works,\r\nbreweries, the mountains of barrels round the so-called Schrotamto,--in a\r\nword, riches which a man not familiar with the city, even though a\r\nwell-to-do possessor of a _grodek_, could not even imagine.\r\n\r\nPowala conducted Macko and Zbyszko to his house situated on Saint Anna\r\nStreet, assigned a large room to them, recommended them to his\r\nshield-bearers, and then went to the castle, from which he returned for\r\nsupper quite late at night.\r\n\r\nA few friends accompanied him, and they enjoyed the plentiful repast of\r\nwine and meat. The host alone was sorrowful. When finally the guests\r\ndeparted, he said to Macko:\r\n\r\n\"I spoke to a canon, able in writing and in the law, who says, that an\r\ninsult to an envoy is a capital offence. Therefore pray God, that the\r\n_Krzyzak_ may not complain.\"\r\n\r\nHearing this, both knights, who, during the feast had exceeded the other\r\nguests in mirth, retired with sorrowful hearts. Macko could not even\r\nsleep and after a while when they were in bed, he said to his nephew:\r\n\r\n\"Zbyszku?\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have considered everything and I do not think they will execute you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You do not think so?\" asked Zbyszko, in a sleepy voice.\r\n\r\nHaving turned toward the wall, he fell sound asleep, because he was very\r\nweary.\r\n\r\nThe next day, both _wlodykas_ of Bogdaniec, went with Powala to morning\r\nmass in the cathedral, for devotion and also to see the court and the\r\nguests who had arrived at the castle. In fact, on the way Powala met many\r\nacquaintances, and among them several knights famous at home and abroad.\r\nAt these Zbyszko looked with admiration, promising himself that if he\r\nescaped death for the insult to Lichtenstein, he would try to rival them\r\nin gallantry and in all knightly virtues. One of these knights,\r\nToporczyk, a relative of the castellan of Krakow, told them that Wojciech\r\nJastrzembiec had returned from Rome, where he had been sent to Pope\r\nBonifacius IX. with the king's invitation to the christening at Krakow.\r\nBonifacius accepted the invitation; and although it was doubtful whether\r\nhe would be able to come personally, he authorized the envoy to stand\r\ngodfather for the coming child in his name; and he asked that the name\r\nBonifacius or Bonifacia be given to the child as a proof of his\r\nparticular love for the king and the queen.\r\n\r\nThey also spoke of the arrival of the Hungarian king, Sigismundus; they\r\nexpected him positively, because he always came, invited or not, whenever\r\nthere was an opportunity for feasts and tournaments. Of these he was very\r\nfond, because he desired to be famous the world over as a ruler, a singer\r\nand the first among knights. Powala, Zawisza of Garbow, Dobko of\r\nOlesnica, Naszan and others of the same rank, recollected with a smile\r\nthat during Sigismundus' first visit, King Wladyslaw requested them\r\nprivately not to attack him very fiercely, but to spare \"the Hungarian\r\nguest,\" whose vanity, known throughout the world, used to make him cry in\r\ncase of defeat. But the most interest was excited among the knights by\r\nWitold's affairs. They told marvelous tales about the magnificence of\r\nthat cradle, made of sterling silver, which the Lithuanian princes and\r\n_bojars_[39] had brought as a present from Witold and his wife, Anna.\r\nMacko told about the proposed enormous expedition against the Tartars.\r\nThe expedition was almost ready, and a great army had already gone\r\neastward toward Rus'. If it were successful, it would extend the king's\r\nsupremacy over almost half the world, to the unknown Asiatic countries,\r\nto the frontier of Persia and to the shores of the Aral. Macko, who\r\nformerly served under Witold and knew his plans, could tell about them so\r\naccurately and even so eloquently, that before the bells were rung for\r\nmass, a large circle of curious people had formed around him. He said\r\nthat the question was simply about a crusade. \"Witold himself,\" he said,\r\n\"although they call him a grand duke, rules over Litwa by Jagiello's\r\nauthority; he is only viceroy, therefore the renown will be the king's.\r\nWhat fame it will be for the newly baptized Lithuanians and for the might\r\nof Poland, when the united armies carry the cross to those countries\r\nwhere, if they mention the Saviour's name at all, it is only to\r\nblaspheme! When the Polish and Lithuanian armies restore Tochtamysh to\r\nthe throne of Kapchak, he will acknowledge himself \"the son\" of King\r\nWladyslaw, and he has promised to bow to the cross with the whole Zlota\r\nOrda.\"\r\n\r\nThe people listened to Macko with great attention; but many did not\r\nthoroughly understand what people Witold intended to help nor against\r\nwhom he intended to fight; therefore some one asked:\r\n\r\n\"Tell exactly with whom is the war to be?\"\r\n\r\n\"With whom? With Tymur the Lame!\" replied Macko.\r\n\r\nThere was a moment of silence. It is true the eastern knights often heard\r\nthe names of Golden, of Blue, of Azovian and of other Ords; but they were\r\nnot familiar with the civil wars of the Tartars. Nevertheless there was\r\nnot one man in Europe, who had not heard about the terrible Tymur the\r\nLame, or Tamerlan. This name was heard with no less fear than of old was\r\nthe name of Attila. He was \"lord of the world\" and \"lord of ages;\" the\r\nruler over twenty-seven conquered states: the ruler of Moskiewskoy\r\nRussia; ruler of Siberia and of China as far as the Indies; of Bagdad, of\r\nIspahan, of Alep, of Damascus--whose shadow was falling over the sands of\r\nArabia, on Egypt, and on Bosphorus in the Greek empire; he was the\r\nexterminator of mankind; the terrible builder of pyramids composed of\r\nhuman skulls; he was the conqueror in all battles, never conquered in\r\nany, \"lord of souls and of bodies.\"\r\n\r\nTochtamysh had been placed by him on the throne of the Golden and the\r\nBlue Ords,[40] and acknowledged as \"the son.\" But when his sovereign\r\nauthority extended from Aral to Crimea, over more lands than were in the\r\nrest of Europe, \"the son\" wanted to be an independent ruler. For this he\r\nwas deposed from his throne with \"one finger\" of the terrible father; he\r\nescaped to the Lithuanian governor and asked him for help. Witold decided\r\nto restore him to his throne; but to do this it was necessary to vie with\r\nthe world-ruling Tymur the Lame.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons his name made a great impression on the audience, and\r\nafter a short silence, one of the oldest knights, Kazko of Jaglow, said:\r\n\r\n\"A difficult business!\"\r\n\r\n\"And for a trifle,\" said the prudent Mikolaj of Dlugolas. \"What\r\ndifference will it make to us, whether Tochtamysh or some Kutluk rules\r\nover the sons of Belial who dwell beyond the tenth-land?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tochtamysh will turn to the Christian faith,\" answered Macko.\r\n\r\n\"He will or he will not! Can you trust dog-brothers, who do not confess\r\nChrist?\"\r\n\r\n\"But we are ready to lay down our lives for Christ's name,\" answered\r\nPowala.\r\n\r\n\"And for knightly honor,\" added Toporczyk, the relative of the castellan;\r\n\"there are some among us however who will not go. The Lord _Wojewoda,\r\nSpytko of Melsztyn_ has a young and beloved wife, but he has already\r\njoined _Kniaz_ Witold.\"\r\n\r\n\"No wonder,\" added Jasko Naszan; \"no matter how hideous a sin you have on\r\nyour soul, pardon and salvation are sure for those who fight in such a\r\nwar.\"\r\n\r\n\"And fame for ages and ages,\" said Powala of Taczew. \"Let us then have a\r\nwar, and it will be better if it be a great war. Tymur has conquered the\r\nworld and has twenty-seven states under him. It will be an honor for our\r\nnation if we defeat him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" answered Toporczyk, \"even if he possesses a hundred kingdoms,\r\nlet others be afraid of him--not us! You speak wisely! Let us gather\r\ntogether ten thousand good spearmen, and we will pass round the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what nation should conquer The Lame, if not ours?\"\r\n\r\nThus the knights conversed. Zbyszko was sorry now because he did not go\r\nwith Witold to the wild steppes. But when he was in Wilno, he wanted to\r\nsee Krakow and its court and take part in the tournaments; but now he\r\nfears that he will find disgrace here at the court, while there on the\r\nsteppes even at the worst, he would have found a glorious death.\r\n\r\nBut the aged Kazko of Jaglow, who was a hundred years old, and whose\r\ncommon sense corresponded to his age, discouraged the zealous knights.\r\n\r\n\"You are stupid!\" said he. \"Is it possible that none of you have beard\r\nthat Christ's image spoke to the queen? If the Saviour himself condescend\r\nto such familiarity, then why will the Holy Ghost, who is the third\r\nperson of the Trinity, be less kind to her. Therefore she sees future\r\nevents, as if they were passing before her, and she has thus spoken:\"\r\n\r\nHere he stopped for a while, shook his head, and then said:\r\n\r\n\"I have forgotten what she prophesied, but I will soon recollect.\"\r\n\r\nHe began to think, and they waited silently, because the popular belief\r\nwas that the queen could see the future.\r\n\r\n\"Aha!\" said he, finally, \"I remember now! The queen said, that if every\r\nknight went with Witold against The Lame-Man, then heathenish power would\r\nbe destroyed. But all cannot go because of the dishonesty of Christian\r\nlords. We are obliged to guard the boundaries from the attacks of the\r\nCzechs and the Hungarians and also from the attacks of the Order, because\r\nwe cannot trust any of them. Therefore if Witold go with only a handful\r\nof Polish warriors, then Tymur the Lame, or his _wojewodas_, coming with\r\ninnumerable hosts, will defeat him.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we are at peace now,\" said Toporczyk, \"and the Order will give some\r\nassistance to Witold. The Knights of the Cross cannot act otherwise, if\r\nonly for the sake of appearances, and to show to the holy father that\r\nthey are ready to fight the pagans. The courtiers say that Kuno von\r\nLichtenstein came not entirely for the christening, but also to consult\r\nwith the king.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here he is!\" exclaimed the astonished Macko.\r\n\r\n\"True!\" said Powala, turning his head. \"So help me God, it is he! He did\r\nnot stay long with the abbot.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is in a hurry,\" answered Macko, gloomily.\r\n\r\nKuno von Lichtenstein passed them. Macko and Zbyszko recognized him by\r\nthe cross embroidered on his mantle; but he did not recognize either of\r\nthem because he had seen them before with their helmets on. Passing by,\r\nhe nodded to Powala of Taczew, and to Toporczyk; then with his\r\nshield-bearers, he ascended the stairs of the cathedral, in a majestic\r\nand stately manner.\r\n\r\nAt that moment the bells resounded, frightening flocks of doves and\r\njackdaws, and announcing that mass would soon begin. Macko and Zbyszko\r\nentered the church with the others, feeling troubled about Lichtenstein's\r\nquick return. The older _wlodyka_ was very uneasy, but the young one's\r\nattention was attracted by the king's court. He was surrounded by noted\r\nmen, famous in war and in counsel. Many of those by whose wisdom the\r\nmarriage of the grand duke of Lithuania with the young and beautiful\r\nqueen of Poland, had been planned and accomplished, were now dead; but a\r\nfew of them were still living, and at these, all looked with the greatest\r\nrespect. The young knight could not admire enough the magnificent figure\r\nof Jasko of Tenczyn, castellan of Krakow, in which sternness was united\r\nwith dignity and honesty; he admired the wise countenances of the\r\ncounsellors and the powerful faces of the knights whose hair was cut\r\nevenly on their foreheads, and fell in long curls on their sides and\r\nbacks. Some of them wore nets, others wore bands to keep the hair in\r\norder. The foreign guests, Hungarian and Austrian, and their attendants,\r\nwere amazed at the great elegance of the costumes; the Lithuanian princes\r\nand _bojars_, notwithstanding the summer heat, were dressed for the sake\r\nof pompous display in costly furs; the Russian princes wore large stiff\r\ndresses, and in the background they looked like Byzantine pictures. With\r\nthe greatest curiosity Zbyszko awaited the appearance of the king and the\r\nqueen. He advanced toward the stalls behind which he could see the red\r\nvelvet cushions near the altar, on which the king and the queen kneeled\r\nduring mass.\r\n\r\nHe did not wait long; the king entered first, through the vestry door,\r\nand before he reached the altar one could have a good look at him. He had\r\nlong, dark, disheveled hair; his face was thin and clean shaven; he had a\r\nlarge pointed nose and some wrinkles around his mouth. His eyes were\r\nsmall, dark, and shining. His face had a kind but cautious look, like\r\nthat of a man who having risen by good luck to a position far beyond his\r\nexpectations, is obliged to think continually whether his actions\r\ncorrespond to his dignity and who is afraid of malicious criticism. This\r\nalso was the reason why in his face and in his movements there was a\r\ncertain impatience. It was very easy to understand that his anger would\r\nbe sudden and dreadful. He was that prince, who being angered at the\r\nfrauds of the Knights of the Cross, shouted after their envoy: \"Thou\r\ncomest to me with a parchment, but I will come to thee with a spear!\"\r\n\r\nBut now this natural vehemence was restrained by great and sincere piety.\r\nHe set a good example, not only to the recently converted Lithuanian\r\nprinces, but even to the Polish lords, pious for generations. Often the\r\nking kneeled, for the greater mortification of the flesh, on bare stones;\r\noften having raised his hands, he held them uplifted until they dropped\r\nwith fatigue. He attended at least three masses every day. After mass he\r\nleft the church as if just awakened from slumber, soothed and gentle. The\r\ncourtiers knew that it was the best time to ask him either for pardon, or\r\nfor a gift.\r\n\r\nJadwiga entered through the vestry door also. Seeing her enter, the\r\nknights standing near the stalls, immediately kneeled, although mass had\r\nnot begun, voluntarily paying her homage as to a saint. Zbyszko did the\r\nsame; nobody in this assembly doubted that he really saw a saint, whose\r\nimage would some time adorn the church altars. Besides the respect due to\r\na queen, they almost worshipped her on account of her religious and holy\r\nlife. It was reported that the queen could perform miracles. They said\r\nthat she could cure the sick by touching them with her hand; that people\r\nwho could not move their legs nor their arms, were able to do it, after\r\nthey put on a dress which the queen had worn. Trustworthy witnesses\r\naffirmed that they had heard with their own ears, Christ speak to her\r\nfrom the altar. Foreign monarchs worshipped her on their knees and even\r\nthe Order of the Knights of the Cross respected her and feared to offend\r\nher. Pope Bonifacius IX. called her the pious and chosen daughter of the\r\nchurch. The world looked at her deeds and remembered that this child of\r\nthe Andegavian[41] house and Polish Piasts[42], this daughter of the\r\npowerful Louis, a pupil of the most fastidious of courts, and also one of\r\nthe most beautiful women on earth, renounced happiness, renounced her\r\nfirst love and being a queen married a \"wild\" prince of Lithuania, in\r\norder to bring to the cross, by his help, the last pagan nation in\r\nEurope. That which could not be accomplished by the forces of all the\r\nGermans, by a sea of poured out blood, was done with one word from her.\r\nNever did the glory of an apostle shine over a younger and more charming\r\nforehead; never was the apostleship united with equal self-denial; never\r\nwas the beauty of a woman lighted with such angelic kindness and such\r\nquiet sadness.\r\n\r\nTherefore minstrels sang about her in all the European courts; knights\r\nfrom the remotest countries came to Krakow to see this \"Queen of Poland;\"\r\nher own people loved her, as the pupil of the eye and their power and\r\nglory had increased by her marriage with Jagiello. Only one great sorrow\r\nhung over her and the nation; for long years this child of God had had no\r\nissue.\r\n\r\nBut now this sorrow had passed away and the joyful news of God's blessing\r\non the queen sped like lightning from the Baltic to the Black Sea, also\r\nto Karpaty[43] and filled with joy all peoples of this powerful kingdom.\r\nIn all foreign courts, except in the capital of the Knights of the Cross,\r\nthe news was received with pleasure. In Rome \"Te Deum\" was sung. In the\r\nprovinces of Poland the belief was firmly established, that anything the\r\n\"Saint lady\" asked of God, would be granted.\r\n\r\nTherefore there came to her people to beseech her, that she ask health\r\nfor them; there came envoys from the provinces and from other countries,\r\nto ask that she pray according to their need, either for rain, or for\r\nfair weather for harvesting; for lucky moving time; for abundant fishing\r\nin the lakes or for game in the forests.\r\n\r\nThose knights, living in castles and _grodeks_ on the frontier, who\r\naccording to the custom learned from the Germans, had become robbers or\r\nwaged war among themselves, at the command of the queen, put their swords\r\nin their scabbards, released their prisoners without ransom, restored\r\nstolen herds and clasped hands in friendship. All kinds of misery, all\r\nkinds of poverty crowded the gates of her castle in Krakow. Her pure\r\nspirit penetrated human hearts, softened the hard lot of the serfs, the\r\ngreat pride of the lords, the unjust severity of the judges, and hovered\r\nlike a dove of happiness, like an angel of justice and peace, over the\r\nwhole country.\r\n\r\nNo wonder then that all were awaiting with anxious hearts for the day of\r\nblessing.\r\n\r\nThe knights looked closely at the figure of the queen, to see if they\r\ncould ascertain how long they would be obliged to wait for the future\r\nheir to the throne. The _ksiondz_[44] bishop of Krakow, Wysz, who was\r\nalso the ablest physician in the country, and famous even abroad, had not\r\nannounced when the delivery would occur. They were making some\r\npreparation; but it was the custom at that time to begin all festivals as\r\nearly as possible, and to prolong them for weeks. In fact the figure of\r\nthe lady, although a little rounded, had retained until now its former\r\ngrandeur. She was dressed with excessive simplicity. Formerly, having\r\nbeen brought up at a brilliant court, and being more beautiful than any\r\nof the contemporary princesses, she was fond of costly fabrics, of\r\nchains, pearls, gold bracelets and rings; but now and even for several\r\nyears past, she not only wore the dress of a nun, but she even covered\r\nher face, fearing that the thoughts of her beauty might arouse in her\r\nworldly vanity. In vain Jagiello, having learned of her condition, in a\r\nrapture of joy ordered her sleeping apartment to be decorated with\r\nbrocade and jewels. Having renounced all luxury, and remembering that the\r\ntime of confinement is often the time of death, she decided that not\r\namong jewels, but in quiet humility she ought to receive the blessing\r\nwhich God had promised to send her.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the gold and jewels went to establish a college and to send the\r\nnewly converted Lithuanian youths to foreign universities.\r\n\r\nThe queen agreed only to change her monastical dress, and from the time\r\nthat the hope of maternity was changed to positive certainty, she did not\r\nveil her face, thinking that the dress of a penitent was no longer\r\nproper.\r\n\r\nConsequently everybody was now looking with love at that beautiful face,\r\nto which neither gold, nor precious stones could add any charm. The queen\r\nwalked slowly from the vestry door toward the altar, with uplifted eyes,\r\nholding in one hand a book, in the other a rosary. Zbyszko saw the\r\nlily-like face, the blue eyes, and the angelic features full of peace,\r\nkindness and mercy, and his heart began to throb with emotion. He knew\r\nthat according to God's command he ought to love the king and the queen,\r\nand he did in his way; but now his heart overflowed with a great love,\r\nwhich did not come by command, but burst forth like a flame; his heart\r\nwas also filled with the greatest worship, humility and desire for\r\nsacrifice. The young _wlodyka_ Zbyszko was impetuous; therefore a desire\r\nimmediately seized him, to show in some way that love and the\r\nfaithfulness of a knight; to accomplish some deed for her; to rush\r\nsomewhere, to conquer some one and to risk his own life for it all. \"I\r\nhad better go with _Kniaz_ Witold,\" he said to himself, \"because how can\r\nI serve the holy lady, if there is no war here.\" He did not stop to think\r\nthat one can serve in other ways as well as with sword or spear or axe;\r\nhe was ready to attack alone the whole power of Tymur the Lame. He wanted\r\nto jump on his charger immediately after mass and begin something. What?\r\nHe did not know himself. He only knew, that he could not hold anything,\r\nthat his hands were burning and his whole soul was on fire.\r\n\r\nHe forgot all about the danger which threatened him. He even forgot about\r\nDanusia, and when he remembered her, having heard the children singing in\r\nthe church, he felt that this love was something different. He had\r\npromised Danusia fidelity; he had promised her three Germans and he would\r\nkeep his promise. But the queen is above all women. While he was thinking\r\nhow many people he would like to kill for the queen, he perceived\r\nregiments of armors, helmets, ostrich feathers, peacocks' crests, and he\r\nfelt that even that would be small in proportion to his desire.\r\n\r\nHe looked at her constantly, pondering with overflowing heart, how he\r\ncould honor her by prayer, because he thought that one could not make an\r\nordinary prayer for a queen. He could say: _Pater noster, qui es in\r\ncoelis, sanctificetur nomen Tuum_, because a certain Franciscan monk\r\ntaught him this in Wilno; but it may be that the Franciscan himself did\r\nnot know more; it may be that Zbyszko had forgotten; but it is certain\r\nthat he could not recite the whole \"Our Father.\" But now he began to\r\nrepeat these few words which in his soul had the following meaning: \"Give\r\nour beloved lady good health, long life and great happiness; care for her\r\nmore than for anyone else.\"\r\n\r\nAs this was repeated by a man over whose head punishment was suspended,\r\ntherefore there was no more sincere prayer in the whole church.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nAfter mass Zbyszko thought that if he could only fall upon his knees\r\nbefore the queen and kiss her feet, then he did not care what happened\r\nafterward. But after the first mass, the queen went to her apartments.\r\nUsually she did not take any nourishment until noontime, and was not\r\npresent at the merry breakfast, during which jugglers and fools appeared\r\nfor the amusement of the king. The old _wlodyka_ of Dlugolas came and\r\nsummoned Zbyszko to the princess.\r\n\r\n\"You will serve Danusia and me at the table as my courtier,\" said the\r\nprincess. \"It may happen that you will please the king by some facetious\r\nword or deed, and the Krzyzak if he recognize you, will not complain to\r\nthe king, seeing that you serve me at the king's table.\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko kissed the princess' hand. Then he turned to Danusia; and\r\nalthough he was more accustomed to battles than to the manners of the\r\ncourt, still he evidently knew what was befitting a knight, when he sees\r\nthe lady of his thoughts in the morning; he retreated, and assuming an\r\nexpression of surprise, and making the sign of the cross, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost!\"\r\n\r\nDanusia, looking at him with her blue eyes, asked:\r\n\r\n\"Why do you make the sign of the cross, Zbyszko, after mass is ended?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because your beauty increased so much, during last night, that I am\r\nastonished!\"\r\n\r\nMikolaj of Dlugolas, who did not like the new, foreign customs of\r\nchivalry, shrugged his shoulders and said:\r\n\r\n\"Don't lose time talking to her about her beauty! She is only a bush\r\nhardly grown up from the soil.\"\r\n\r\nAt this Zbyszko looked at him with rancor.\r\n\r\n\"You must be careful about calling her a 'bush,'\" said he, turning pale\r\nwith anger; \"if you were younger, I would challenge you immediately and\r\nwould fight until either you or I were dead!\"\r\n\r\n\"Keep quiet, you beardless boy! I can manage you even to-day!\"\r\n\r\n\"Be quiet!\" said the princess. \"Instead of thinking about your own\r\ndanger, you are seeking a quarrel! I would prefer to find a more steady\r\nknight for Danusia. If you wish to foam, go where you please; but we do\r\nnot need you here.\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko felt abashed at the princess' words and began to apologize. But\r\nhe thought to himself that if Pan Mikolaj of Dlugolas had a grown-up son,\r\nthen sometime he would challenge the son and would not forgive Mikolaj\r\nfor calling her \"bush.\" Now he determined to be quiet while in the king's\r\ncastle and not to provoke anybody, only in case of absolute necessity.\r\n\r\nThe blowing of horns announced that breakfast was ready; therefore the\r\nPrincess Anna taking Danusia by the hand, went to the king's apartments,\r\nwhere the lay-dignitaries and the knights, stood awaiting her arrival.\r\nPrincess Ziemowita entered first, because being the king's sister, she\r\noccupied a higher seat at the table. Soon the hall was filled with\r\nguests, dignitaries and knights. The king was seated at the upper end of\r\nthe table, having near him Wojciech Jastrzembiec, bishop of Krakow, the\r\nbishop, although inferior in rank to the other priests wearing mitres,\r\nwas seated at the right hand of the king because he was the pope's envoy.\r\nThe two princesses took the next places. Near Anna Danuta, the former\r\narchbishop of Gniezno, Jan, was comfortably seated in a large chair. He\r\nwas a descendant of the Piasts of Szlonsk and the son of Bolko, Prince of\r\nOpole. Zbyszko had heard of him at the court of Witold; and now while\r\nstanding behind the princess and Danusia, he recognized the archbishop by\r\nhis abundant hair which being curled, made his head look like a\r\n_kropidlo_.[45] At the courts of the Polish princes, they called him\r\n\"Kropidlo,\" for this reason; and the Knights of the Cross gave him the\r\nname of \"Grapidla.\" He was noted for his gaiety and giddy manners. Having\r\nreceived the nomination for the archbishopric of Gniezno, against the\r\nking's wish, he took possession of it by military force; for this act he\r\nwas deprived of his rank. He then joined the Knights of the Cross who\r\ngave him the poor bishopric of Kamieniec in Pomorze. Then he concluded\r\nthat it was better to be friendly with the mighty king; he craved his\r\npardon, returned to the country and was now waiting for a vacancy to\r\noccur, hoping that the good hearted lord would let him fill it. He was\r\nnot mistaken as the future proved. In the meantime he was trying to win\r\nthe king's heart by merry frolics. But he still liked the Knights of the\r\nCross. Even now, at the court of Jagiello where he was not greatly\r\nwelcomed by the dignitaries and knights, he sought Lichtenstein's company\r\nand gladly sat beside him at the table.\r\n\r\nZbyszko, standing behind the princess' chair, was so near to the Krzyzak,\r\nLichtenstein, that he could have touched him with his hand. In fact, his\r\nfingers began to twitch, but he overcame his impetuosity and did not\r\npermit himself any evil thoughts. But he could not refrain from looking\r\neagerly at Lichtenstein's head and shoulders, trying to decide whether he\r\nwould have a hard fight with him, if they met either during the war, or\r\nin single combat. He concluded that it would not be difficult to conquer\r\nthe German. The Krzyzak's shoulder bones appeared quite large under his\r\ndress of grey broadcloth; but he was only a weakling compared with Powala\r\nor with Paszko Zlodziej of Biskupice, or with both of the most famous\r\nSulimczyks, or with Krzon of Kozieglowy or with many of the other\r\nknights, sitting at the king's table.\r\n\r\nAt these knights Zbyszko looked with admiration and envy; but his\r\nattention was also attracted by the actions of the king, who at this\r\nmoment gathered his hair with his fingers and pushed it behind his ears,\r\nas if he was impatient because breakfast was not served. His eyes rested\r\nfor a moment on Zbyszko, and at that the young knight felt afraid,\r\nfearing that perhaps he would be obliged to face the angry king. This was\r\nthe first time he had thought seriously about the consequences of his\r\nrash action. Until now it had seemed to him to be something remote,\r\ntherefore not worthy of sorrow.\r\n\r\nThe German did not know that that youth who dad attacked him so boldly on\r\nthe highway, was so near. The breakfast began. They brought in caudle,\r\nseasoned so strongly with eggs, cinnamon, cloves, ginger and saffron,\r\nthat the fragrance filled the whole room. In the meanwhile the fool\r\nCiaruszek, sitting on a chair in the doorway, began to imitate the\r\nsinging of a nightingale, of which the king was very fond. Then another\r\njester went around the table, stopped behind the guests and imitated the\r\nbuzzing of a bee so well, that some of them began to defend their heads.\r\nSeeing this, the others burst with laughter. Zbyszko had served the\r\nprincess and Danusia diligently; but when Lichtenstein began to clap his\r\nbaldhead, he again forgot about his danger and began to laugh. The young\r\nLithuanian _kniaz_, Jamut, who was standing beside him, also laughed at\r\nthis very heartily. The Krzyzak having finally noticed his mistake, put\r\nhis hand in his pocket, and turning to the bishop, Kropidlo, said a few\r\nwords to him in German; the bishop immediately repeated them in Polish.\r\n\r\n\"The noble lord says to you,\" said he, turning toward the fool, \"that you\r\nwill receive two _skojce_; but do not buzz too near, because the bee is\r\ndriven away, but the drones are killed.\"\r\n\r\nThe fool took the two _skojce_ given to him by the Krzyzak, and taking\r\nadvantage of the license granted at all courts to the fools, answered:\r\n\r\n\"There is plenty of honey in the province of Dobrzyn;[46] that is why it\r\nis beset with the drones. Drive them, King Wladyslaw!\"\r\n\r\n\"Here is a penny from me, because you have said a clever thing,\" said\r\nKropidlo, \"but remember that if the rope break, the beehive keeper break\r\nhis neck.[47] Those drones from Malborg, by whom Dobrzyn is beset, have\r\nstings, and it is dangerous to climb to the beehives.\"\r\n\r\n\"Owa!\" exclaimed Zyndram of Maszkow, the sword bearer of Krakow, \"one can\r\nsmoke them out!\"\r\n\r\n\"With what?\"\r\n\r\n\"With powder.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or cut the beehive with an axe,\" added the gigantic Paszko Zlodziej of\r\nBiskupice.\r\n\r\nZbyszko's heart was ready to leap with joy, because he thought that such\r\nwords betokened war. Kuno von Lichtenstein understood what was said,\r\nbecause during his long sojourn in Torun and Chelmno, he learned the\r\nPolish language; but he would not use it on account of pride. But now,\r\nbeing irritated by the words of Zyndram of Maszkow, he looked at him\r\nsharply with his grey eyes and said:\r\n\r\n\"We shall see.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our fathers saw at Plowce[48] and at Wilno,\" answered Zyndram.\r\n\r\n\"_Pax vobiscum!_\" exclaimed Kropidlo. \"_Pax, pax!_ If only the\r\n_ksiondz_[49] Mikolaj of Kurow, will give up his Kujawian bishopric, and\r\nthe gracious king appoint me in his place, I will preach you such a\r\nbeautiful sermon about the love between Christian nations, that you will\r\nsincerely repent. Hatred is nothing but _ignis_ and _ignis infernalis_ at\r\nthat; such a dreadful fire that one cannot extinguish it with water, but\r\nis obliged to pour wine on it. Give us some wine! We will go on\r\n_ops_,[50] as the late Bishop Zawisza of Kurozwenki used to say!\"\r\n\r\n\"And from _ops_ to hell, the devil says,\" added the fool Ciaruszek.\r\n\r\n\"Let him take you!\"\r\n\r\n\"It would be more amusing for him to take you. They have not yet seen the\r\ndevil with Kropidlo, but I think we shall all have that pleasure.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will sprinkle you first. Give us some wine and may love blossom among\r\nthe Christians!\"\r\n\r\n\"Among true Christians!\" added Kuno von Lichtenstein, emphatically.\r\n\r\n\"What?\" exclaimed the Krakowian bishop Wysz, raising his head; \"are you\r\nnot in an old Christian kingdom? Are not our churches older than yours in\r\nMalborg?\"[51]\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" answered the Krzyzak. The king was especially sensitive\r\nwhere any question about Christianity arose. It seemed to him that the\r\nKrzyzak wished to make an allusion to him; therefore his cheeks flamed\r\nimmediately and his eyes began to shine.\r\n\r\n\"What!\" said he, in a deep voice, \"am I not a Christian king?\"\r\n\r\n\"The kingdom calls itself a Christian one,\" coolly answered the Krzyzak;\r\n\"but its customs are pagan.\"\r\n\r\nAt this many angry knights arose; Marcin of Wrocimowice, whose coat of\r\narms was Polkoza, Florian of Korytnica, Bartosz of Wodzinek, Domarat of\r\nKobylany, Zyndram of Maszkow, Powala of Taczew, Paszko Zlodziej of\r\nBiskupice, Jaxa of Targowisko, Krzon of Kozieglowy, Zygmunt of Bobowa and\r\nStaszko of Charbimowice, powerful and famous knights, victorious in many\r\nbattles and in many tournaments. Alternately blushing and turning pale\r\nfrom anger, gnashing their teeth, they began to shout:\r\n\r\n\"Woe to us! He is a guest and we cannot challenge him!\"\r\n\r\nZawisza Czarny, Sulimczyk, the most famous among the famous, \"the model\r\nof knighthood,\" turned to Lichtenstein with a frown on his forehead and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"I do not recognize you, Kuno. How can you, a knight, insult a mighty\r\nnation, when you know that, being an envoy, you cannot be punished for\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nBut Kuno quietly sustained the threatening look, and answered slowly and\r\nprecisely:\r\n\r\n\"Our Order, before it came to Prussia, fought in Palestine; even there\r\nthe Saracens respected the envoys. But you do not respect them; that is\r\nthe reason I called your customs pagan.\"\r\n\r\nAt these words the uproar increased. Round the table again were heard\r\nshouts: \"Woe! Woe!\"\r\n\r\nBut they subsided when the king, who was furious, clasped his hands in\r\nthe Lithuanian fashion. Then the old Jasko Topor of Tenczyn, castellan of\r\nKrakow, venerable, grave and dreaded on account of the importance of his\r\noffice, arose and said:\r\n\r\n\"Noble Knight of Lichtenstein, if you, an envoy, have been insulted,\r\nspeak, and severe punishment will be given quickly.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would not have happened to me in any other Christian country,\"\r\nanswered Kuno. \"Yesterday on the road to Tyniec I was attacked by one of\r\nyour knights, and although he could very easily recognize by the cross on\r\nmy mantle who I was, he attempted my life.\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko, having heard these words, became very pale and involuntarily\r\nglanced at the king, whose anger was terrible. Jasko of Tenczyn was\r\nsurprised, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Can it be possible?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ask the Pan of Taczew, who was a witness of the incident.\"\r\n\r\n\"All eyes turned toward Powala, who stood for a while gloomy, and with\r\nlowered eyelids; then he said:\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is so!\"\r\n\r\nHearing this the knights began to shout: \"Shame! Shame! The earth will\r\ndevour such a man!\" Because of this disgrace some of them began to strike\r\ntheir chests with their hands, and others to rap the silver dishes, not\r\nknowing what to do.\r\n\r\n\"Why did you not kill him?\" shouted the king.\r\n\r\n\"Because his head belongs to the court,\" answered Powala.\r\n\r\n\"Have you put him in prison?\" asked the castellan, Topor of Tenczyn.\r\n\r\n\"No. He is a _wlodyka_, who swore on his knightly honor, that he would\r\nappear.\"\r\n\r\n\"But he will not appear!\" ironically exclaimed Kuno, raising his head.\r\n\r\nAt that moment a young voice resounded behind the Krzyzak:\r\n\r\n\"I did it; I, Zbyszko of Bogdaniec!\"\r\n\r\nAfter these words the knights rushed toward the unhappy Zbyszko; but they\r\nwere stopped by a threatening nod from the king who began to shout in an\r\nangry voice, similar to the rattling of a carriage rolling over the\r\nstones:\r\n\r\n\"Cut his head off! Cut his head off! Let the Krzyzak send it to Malborg\r\nto the grand master!\"\r\n\r\nThen he cried to the young Lithuanian prince standing near.\r\n\r\n\"Hold him, Jamont!\"\r\n\r\nThe frightened Jamont put his trembling hands on Zbyszko's shoulders.\r\n\r\nBut the white-bearded castellan of Krakow, Topor of Tenczyn, raised his\r\nhand as a sign that he wished to speak; when everybody was quiet, he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Gracious king! Let this _comthur_ be convinced that not only your\r\nimpetuous anger, but our laws will punish with death any who insult an\r\nenvoy. Otherwise he will think that there are no Christian laws in this\r\ncountry. To-morrow I will judge the offender.\"\r\n\r\nThe last words he said quietly and as though no one could change his\r\ndecision. Then he said to Jamont:\r\n\r\n\"Shut him in the tower. As for you, Pan of Taczew, you will be a\r\nwitness.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will tell about the offence of this lad,\" answered Powala, looking at\r\nLichtenstein.\r\n\r\n\"He is right!\" immediately said some knights. \"He is only a lad! Why\r\nshould the shame be put on us all!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a moment of silence, and angry looks were cast at the Krzyzak.\r\nIn the meanwhile Jamont conducted Zbyszko to the court-yard of the castle\r\nand intrusted him to the archers. In his young heart he pitied the\r\nprisoner, and this pity was increased by his natural hatred of the\r\nGermans. But he was a Lithuanian, accustomed to fulfill blindly the\r\norders of the grand duke; being himself afraid of the king's wrath, he\r\nbegan to whisper to the young knight, with kindly persuasion:\r\n\r\n\"Do you know, what I would do if in your place? Hang myself! It will be\r\nthe best! The _korol_[52] is angry; they will cut off your head. Why\r\nshould you not make him joyful? Hang yourself, _druh_.[53] Such is the\r\ncustom in my country.\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko, half dazed with shame and fear, at first did not seem to\r\nunderstand the words of the _kniazik_;[54] but finally he understood them\r\nand then he was amazed:\r\n\r\n\"What do you say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hang yourself! Why should they judge you. You will only afford pleasure\r\nfor the king!\" repeated Jamont.\r\n\r\n\"Hang your own self!\" exclaimed the young _wlodyka_. \"They have baptized\r\nyou but your heathen skin remains on you. Do you not know that it is a\r\nsin for a Christian to kill himself?\"\r\n\r\nThe _kniaz_ shrugged his shoulders:\r\n\r\n\"It will not be according to your will. They will cut off your head just\r\nthe same.\"\r\n\r\nThese words angered Zbyszko, and he wondered if it would be proper to\r\nchallenge the _bojarzynek_[55] for a fight either on horseback or on\r\nfoot, with swords or with axes; but he stifled this desire. He dropped\r\nhis head sadly and surrounded by the archers, went silently to the tower.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile everybody's attention in the dining hall was turned to\r\nDanusia, who became pale with fright. She stood motionless like a wax\r\nfigure in a church. But when she heard that they were going to execute\r\nZbyszko, then she was seized with great fear; her mouth quivered and at\r\nonce she began to cry so loudly and so pitifully, that all faces turned\r\ntoward her and the king himself asked her:\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter with thee?\"\r\n\r\n\"Gracious king!\" said the Princess Anna, \"she is the daughter of Jurand\r\nof Spychow and this unhappy knight made a vow to her. He promised her to\r\ntear three peacock tufts from the helmets of the Germans, and having\r\nnoticed such a tuft on the helmet of this _comthur_, he thought that God\r\nhimself had sent the Krzyzak. He did not attack him, lord, through\r\nmalice, but through stupidity; therefore be merciful and do not punish\r\nhim, we beseech you on our knees!\"\r\n\r\nHaving said this she arose, seized Danusia by the hand, and rushed with\r\nher toward the king, who seeing this began to retire. But both kneeled\r\nbefore him and Danusia began to cry;\r\n\r\n\"Forgive Zbyszko, king, forgive Zbyszko!\"\r\n\r\nBecause she was afraid, she hid her fair head between the folds of the\r\nking's dress, kissed his knees and trembled like a leaf. Anna Ziemowitowa\r\nkneeled on the other side and having clasped her hands, looked at the\r\nking on whose face there was visible great perplexity. He retired toward\r\nthe chair, but did not push Danusia back, only waved his hands.\r\n\r\n\"Do not trouble me!\" he cried. \"The youth is guilty; he has brought\r\ndisgrace on the country! They must execute him!\"\r\n\r\nBut the little hands clung closer and closer to his knees and the child\r\ncried more and more pitifully:\r\n\r\n\"Forgive Zbyszko, king, forgive Zbyszko!\"\r\n\r\nNow the voices of some knights were heard to exclaim:\r\n\r\n\"Jurand of Spychow is a famous knight, and the cause of awe to the\r\nGermans.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that youth fought bravely at Wilno!\" added Powala.\r\n\r\nBut the king excused himself further, although he pitied Danusia.\r\n\r\n\"He is not guilty toward me and it is not I who can forgive him. Let the\r\nenvoy of the Order pardon him, then I will pardon him also; but if the\r\nenvoy will not, then he must die.\"\r\n\r\n\"Forgive him, sir!\" exclaimed both of the princesses.\r\n\r\n\"Forgive, forgive!\" repeated the voices of the knights.\r\n\r\nKuno closed his eyes and sat with uplifted forehead, as if he was\r\ndelighted to see both princesses and such famous knights entreating him.\r\nThen his appearance changed; he dropped his head, crossed his hands on\r\nhis breast and from a proud man became a humble one, and said with a\r\nsoft, mild voice:\r\n\r\n\"Christ, our Saviour, forgave his enemies and even the malefactor on the\r\ncross.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is a true knight!\" said Bishop Wysz.\r\n\r\n\"He is, he is!\"\r\n\r\n\"How can I refuse to forgive,\" continued Kuno, \"being not only a\r\nChristian, but also a monk? Therefore I forgive him with all my heart, as\r\nChrist's servant and friar!\"\r\n\r\n\"Honor to him!\" shouted Powala of Taczew.\r\n\r\n\"Honor!\" repeated the others.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said the Krzyzak, \"I am here among you as an envoy and I carry in\r\nme the majesty of the whole Order which is Christ's Order. Whosoever\r\noffends me, therefore, offends the Order; and whosoever offends the\r\nOrder, offends Christ himself; and such an offence, I, in the presence of\r\nGod and the people, cannot forgive; and if your law does not punish it,\r\nlet all Christian lords know.\"\r\n\r\nAfter these words, there was a profound silence. Then after a while there\r\ncould be heard here and there the gnashing of teeth, the heavy breathing\r\nof suppressed wrath and Danusia's sobbings.\r\n\r\nBy evening all hearts were in sympathy with Zbyszko. The same knights who\r\nin the morning were ready to cut him into pieces, were now considering\r\nhow they could help him. The princesses determined to see the queen, and\r\nbeseech her to prevail upon Lichtenstein to withdraw his complaint; or if\r\nnecessary to write to the grand master of the Order, and ask him to\r\ncommand Kuno to give up the case. This plan seemed to be the best because\r\nJadwiga was regarded with such unusual respect that if the grand master\r\nrefused her request, it would make the pope angry and also all Christian\r\nlords. It was not likely that he would refuse because Konrad von\r\nJungingen was a peaceable man. Unfortunately Bishop Wysz of Krakow, who\r\nwas also the queen's physician, forbade them to mention even a word about\r\nthis affair to the queen. \"She never likes to hear about death\r\nsentences,\" he said, \"and she takes even the question of a simple\r\nrobber's death too seriously; she will worry much more if she hear about\r\nthis young man who hopes to obtain mercy from her. But such anxiety will\r\nmake her seriously ill, and her health is worth more to the whole kingdom\r\nthan ten knightly heads.\" He finally said that if anyone should dare,\r\nnotwithstanding what he had said, to disturb the queen, on that one he\r\nwould cause the king's anger to rest and then he threatened such an one\r\nwith excommunication.\r\n\r\nBoth princesses were frightened at such menace and determined to be\r\nsilent before the queen; but instead to beseech the king until he showed\r\nsome mercy. The whole court and all the knights sympathized with Zbyszko.\r\nPowala of Taczew declared that he would tell the whole truth; but that he\r\nwould also speak in favor of the young man, because the whole affair was\r\nonly an instance of childish impetuousness. But notwithstanding all this,\r\neverybody could see, and the castellan, Jasko of Tenczyn made it known,\r\nthat if the Krzyzak was unrelenting, then the severe law must be\r\nfulfilled.\r\n\r\nTherefore the knights were still more indignant against Lichtenstein and\r\nthey all thought and even said frankly: \"He is an envoy and cannot be\r\ncalled to the lists; but when he returns to Malborg, God will not permit\r\nthat he die a natural death.\" They were not talking in vain, because a\r\nknight who wore the girdle was not permitted to say even one word without\r\nmeaning it, and the knight who vowed anything, was obliged to accomplish\r\nhis vow or perish. Powala was the most implacably angry because he had a\r\nbeloved daughter of Danusia's age in Taczew, and Danusia's tears made his\r\nheart tender.\r\n\r\nConsequently, that same day, he went to see Zbyszko, in his underground\r\ncell, commanded him to have hope, and told him about the princesses'\r\nprayers and about Danusia's tears. Zbyszko having learned that the girl\r\nthrew herself at the king's feet for his sake, was moved to tears, and\r\nwishing to express his gratitude, said, wiping his tears with his hand:\r\n\r\n\"Hej! may God bless her, and permit me as soon as possible to engage in a\r\ncombat, either on horseback or on foot, for her sake! I did not promise\r\nGermans enough to her! To such a lady, I ought to vow as many as she has\r\nyears. If the Lord Jesus will only release me from this tower, I will not\r\nbe niggardly with her!\" He raised his eyes, full of gratitude.\r\n\r\n\"First promise something to some church,\" advised the _Pan_ of Taczew;\r\n\"if your promise is pleasing, you will surely soon be free. Now listen;\r\nyour uncle went to see Lichtenstein, and I will go see him also. It will\r\nbe no shame for you to ask his pardon, because you are guilty; and then\r\nyou do not ask for pardon of Lichtenstein, but an envoy. Are you ready?\"\r\n\r\n\"As soon as such a knight as your grace tells me it is proper, I will do\r\nit. But if he require me to ask him for pardon in the same way he asked\r\nus to do it, on the road from Tyniec, then let them cut off my head. My\r\nuncle will remain and he will avenge me when the envoy's mission is\r\nended.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall hear first what he says to Macko,\" answered Powala.\r\n\r\nAnd Macko really went to see the German; but he returned as gloomy as the\r\nnight and went directly to the king, to whom he was presented by the\r\ncastellan, himself. The king received Macko kindly because he had been\r\nappeased; when Macko kneeled, he immediately told him to arise, asking\r\nwhat he wished.\r\n\r\n\"Gracious lord,\" said Macko, \"there was an offence, there must be a\r\npunishment; otherwise, there would be no law in the world. But I am also\r\nguilty because I did not try to restrain the natural impetuosity of that\r\nyouth; I even praised him for it. It is my fault, gracious king, because\r\nI often told him: 'First cut, and then look to see whom you have hurt.'\r\nThat was right in war, but wrong at the court! But he is a man, pure as\r\ngold, the last of our family!\"\r\n\r\n\"He has brought shame upon me and upon my kingdom,\" said the king; \"shall\r\nI be gracious to him for that?\"\r\n\r\nMacko was silent, because when he thought about Zbyszko, grief\r\noverpowered him; after a long silence, he began to talk in a broken\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n\"I did not know that I loved him so well; I only know it now when\r\nmisfortune has come. I am old and he is last of the family. If he\r\nperish--we perish! Merciful king and lord, have pity on our family!\"\r\n\r\nHere Macko kneeled again and having stretched out his arms wasted by war,\r\nhe spoke with tears:\r\n\r\n\"We defended Wilno; God gave us honest booty; to whom shall I leave it?\r\nIf the Krzyzak requires punishment, let punishment come; but permit me to\r\nsuffer it. What do I care for life without Zbyszko! He is young; let him\r\nredeem the land and beget children, as God ordered man to do. The Krzyzak\r\nwill not ask whose head was cut off, if there is one cut. There will be\r\nno shame on the family. It is difficult for a man to die; but it is\r\nbetter that one man perish than that a family should be destroyed.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking thus he clasped the king's legs; the king began to wink his\r\neyes, which was a sign of emotion with him; finally he said:\r\n\r\n\"It can not be! I cannot condemn to death a belted knight! It cannot be!\r\nIt cannot be!\"\r\n\r\n\"And there would be no justice in it,\" added the castellan. \"The law will\r\ncrush the guilty one; but it is not a monster, which does not look to see\r\nwhose blood is being shed. And you must consider what shame would fall on\r\nyour family, if your nephew agreed to your proposal. It would be\r\nconsidered a disgrace, not only to him, but to his children also.\"\r\n\r\nTo this Macko replied:\r\n\r\n\"He would not agree. But if it were done without his knowledge, he would\r\navenge me, even as I also will avenge him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha!\" said Tenczynski, \"persuade the Krzyzak to withdraw the complaint.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have asked him.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what?\" asked the king, stretching his neck; \"what did he say?\"\r\n\r\n\"He answered me thus: 'You ought to have asked me for pardon on the road\r\nto Tyniec; you would not then; now I will not.'\"\r\n\r\n\"And why didn't you do it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because he required us to dismount and apologize on foot.\"\r\n\r\nThe king having put his hair behind his ears, commenced to say something\r\nwhen a courtier entered to announce that the Knight of Lichtenstein was\r\nasking for an audience.\r\n\r\nHaving heard this, Jagiello looked at Jasko of Tenczyn, then at Macko. He\r\nordered them to remain, perhaps with the hope that he would be able to\r\ntake advantage of this opportunity and using his kingly authority, bring\r\nthe affair to an end.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Krzyzak entered, bowed to the king, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Gracious lord! Here is the written complaint about the insult which I\r\nsuffered in your kingdom.\"\r\n\r\n\"Complain to him,\" answered the king, pointing to Jasko of Tenczyn.\r\n\r\nThe Krzyzak, looking directly into the king's face, said:\r\n\r\n\"I know neither your laws nor your courts; I only know, that an envoy of\r\nthe Order can complain only to the king.\"\r\n\r\nJagiello's small eyes flashed with impatience; he stretched out his hand\r\nhowever, and accepted the complaint which he handed to Tenczynski.\r\n\r\nThe castellan unfolded it and began to read; but the further he read, the\r\nmore sorrowful and sad his face became.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" said he, finally, \"you are seeking the life of that lad, as though\r\nhe were dangerous to the whole Order. Is it possible that the Knights of\r\nthe Cross are afraid even of the children?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Knights of the Cross are not afraid of anyone,\" answered the\r\n_comthur_, proudly.\r\n\r\nAnd the old castellan added:\r\n\r\n\"And especially of God.\"\r\n\r\nThe next day Powala of Taczew testified to everything he could before the\r\ncourt of the castellan, that would lessen the enormity of Zbyszko's\r\noffence. But in vain did he attribute the deed to childishness and lack\r\nof experience; in vain he said that even some one older, if he had made\r\nthe same vow, prayed for its fulfillment and then had suddenly perceived\r\nin front of him such a crest, would also have believed that it was God's\r\nprovidence. But one thing, the worthy knight could not deny; had it not\r\nbeen for him, Zbyszko's spear would have pierced the Krzyzak's chest.\r\nKuno had brought to the court the armor which he wore that day; it\r\nappeared that it was so thin that Zbyszko with his great strength, would\r\nhave pierced it and killed the envoy, if Powala of Taczew had not\r\nprevented him. Then they asked Zbyszko if he intended to kill the\r\nKrzyzak, and he could not deny it. \"I warned him from afar,\" said he, \"to\r\npoint his lance, and had he shouted in reply that he was an envoy, I\r\nwould not have attacked him.\"\r\n\r\nThese words pleased the knights who, on account of their sympathy for the\r\nlad, were present in great numbers, and immediately numerous voices were\r\nheard to say: \"True! Why did he not reply!\" But the castellan's face\r\nremained gloomy and severe. Having ordered those present to be silent, he\r\nmeditated for a while, then looked sharply at Zbyszko, and asked:\r\n\r\n\"Can you swear by the Passion of our Lord that you saw neither the mantle\r\nnor the cross?\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" answered Zbyszko. \"Had I not seen the cross, I would have thought\r\nhe was one of our knights, and I would not have attacked one of ours.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how was it possible to find any Krzyzak near Krakow, except an\r\nenvoy, or some one from his retinue?\"\r\n\r\nTo this Zbyszko did not reply, because there was nothing to be said. To\r\neverybody it was clear, that if the _Pan_ of Taczanow had not interposed,\r\nat the present moment there would lie before them not the armor of the\r\nenvoy, but the envoy himself, with pierced breast--an eternal disgrace to\r\nthe Polish nation;--therefore even those who sympathized with Zbyszko,\r\nwith their whole souls, understood that he could not expect a mild\r\nsentence.\r\n\r\nIn fact, after a while the castellan said:\r\n\r\n\"As you did not stop to think whom you were attacking, and you did it\r\nwithout anger, therefore our Saviour will forgive you; but you had better\r\ncommit yourself to the care of the Most Holy Lady, because the law cannot\r\ncondone your offence.\"\r\n\r\nHaving heard this, Zbyszko, although he expected such words, became\r\nsomewhat pale; but he soon shook his long hair, made the sign of the\r\ncross, and said:\r\n\r\n\"God's will! I cannot help it!\"\r\n\r\nThen he turned to Macko and looked expressively at Lichtenstein, as if to\r\nrecommend him to Macko's memory; his uncle nodded in return that he\r\nunderstood and would remember. Lichtenstein also understood the look and\r\nthe nod, and although he was as courageous as implacable, a cold shiver\r\nran through him--so dreadful and ill-omened was the face of the old\r\nwarrior. The Krzyzak knew that between him and that knight it would be a\r\nquestion of life or death. That even if he wanted to avoid the combat, he\r\ncould not do it; that when his mission was ended, they must meet, even at\r\nMalborg.[56]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the castellan went to the adjoining room to dictate the\r\nsentence to a secretary. Some of the knights during the interruption came\r\nnear the Krzyzak, saying:\r\n\r\n\"May they give you a more merciful sentence in the great day of\r\njudgment!\"\r\n\r\nBut Lichtenstein cared only for the opinion of Zawisza, because he was\r\nnoted all over the world for his knightly deeds, his knowledge of the\r\nlaws of chivalry and his great exactness in keeping them. In the most\r\nentangled affairs in which there was any question about knightly honor,\r\nthey used to go to him even from distant lands. Nobody contradicted his\r\ndecisions, not only because there was no chance of victory in a contest\r\nwith him, but because they considered him \"the mirror of honor.\" One word\r\nof blame or praise from his mouth was quickly known by the knighthood of\r\nPoland, Hungary, Bohemia (Czech) and Germany; and he could decide between\r\nthe good and evil actions of a knight.\r\n\r\nTherefore Lichtenstein approached him as if he would like to justify his\r\ndeadly grudge, and said:\r\n\r\n\"The grand master himself, with the chapter, could show him clemency; but\r\nI cannot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your grand master has nothing to do with our laws; our king can show\r\nclemency to our people, not he,\" answered Zawisza.\r\n\r\n\"I as the envoy was obliged to insist upon punishment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lichtenstein, you were first a knight, afterward an envoy!\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think that I acted against honor?\"\r\n\r\n\"You know our books of chivalry, and you know that they order us to\r\nimitate two animals, the lamb and the lion. Which of the two have you,\r\nimitated in this case?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are not my judge!\"\r\n\r\n\"You asked me if you had committed an offence, and I answered as I\r\nthought.\"\r\n\r\n\"You give me a hard answer, which I cannot swallow.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will be choked by your own malice, not by mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Christ will put to my account, the fact that I cared more about the\r\ndignity of the Order, than about your praise.\"\r\n\r\n\"He will judge all of us.\"\r\n\r\nFurther conversation was interrupted by the reappearance of the castellan\r\nand the secretary. They knew that the sentence would be a severe one, and\r\neveryone waited silently. The castellan sat at the table, and, having\r\ntaken a crucifix in his hand, ordered Zbyszko to kneel.\r\n\r\nThe secretary began to read the sentence in Latin. It was a sentence of\r\ndeath. When the reading was over, Zbyszko struck himself several times on\r\nthe chest, repeating; \"God be merciful to me, a sinner!\"\r\n\r\nThen he arose and threw himself in Macko's arms, who began to kiss his\r\nhead and eyes.\r\n\r\nIn the evening of the same day, a herald announced at the four corners of\r\nthe market place with the sound of trumpets, to the knights, guests and\r\nburghers assembled, that the noble Zbyszko of Bogdaniec was sentenced by\r\nthe castellan's court to be decapitated by the sword.\r\n\r\nBut Macko obtained a delay of the execution; this was readily granted,\r\nbecause in those days they used to allow prisoners plenty of time to\r\ndispose of their property, as well as to be reconciled to God.\r\nLichtenstein himself did not wish to insist upon an early execution of\r\nthe sentence, because he understood, that as long as he obtained\r\nsatisfaction for the offended majesty of the Order, it would be bad\r\npolicy to estrange the powerful monarch, to whom he was sent not only to\r\ntake part in the solemnity of the christening, but also to attend to the\r\nnegotiations about the province of Dobrzyn. But the chief reason for the\r\ndelay was the queen's health. Bishop Wysz did not wish even to hear about\r\nthe execution before her delivery, rightly thinking, that it would be\r\ndifficult to conceal such an affair from the lady. She would feel such\r\nsorrow and distress that it would be very injurious to her health. For\r\nthese reasons, they granted Zbyszko several weeks, and perhaps more, of\r\nlife, to make his final arrangements and to bid his friends farewell.\r\n\r\nMacko visited him every day and tried to console him. They spoke\r\nsorrowfully about Zbyszko's inevitable death, and still more sorrowfully\r\nabout the fact that the family would become extinct.\r\n\r\n\"It cannot be otherwise, unless you marry,\" Zbyszko said once.\r\n\r\n\"I would prefer to find some distant relative,\" answered the sorrowful\r\nMacko. \"How can I think about women, when they are going to behead you.\r\nAnd even if I am obliged to marry, I will not do it, until I send a\r\nknightly challenge to Lichtenstein, and seek to avenge your death. Do not\r\nfear!\"\r\n\r\n\"God will reward you. I have at least that joy! But I know that you will\r\nnot forgive him. How will you avenge me?\"\r\n\r\n\"When his duty as an envoy has ended, there may be a war! If there be\r\nwar, I will send him a challenge for single combat before the battle.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the leveled ground?\"\r\n\r\n\"On the leveled ground, on horseback or on foot, but only for death, not\r\nfor captivity. If there be peace, then I will go to Malborg and will\r\nstrike the door of the castle gates with my spear, and will order the\r\ntrumpeter to proclaim that I challenge Kuno to fight until death. He\r\ncannot avoid the contest!\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely he will not refuse. And you will defeat him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Defeat? I could not defeat Zawisza, Paszko, nor Powala; but without\r\nboasting, I can take care of two like him. That scoundrel Krzyzak shall\r\nsee! That Fryzjan knight, was he not stronger? And how I cut him through\r\nthe helmet, until the axe stopped! Did I not?\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko breathed with relief and said:\r\n\r\n\"I will perish with some consolation.\"\r\n\r\nThey both began to sigh, and the old nobleman spoke with emotion:\r\n\r\n\"You mustn't break down with sorrow. Your bones will not search for one\r\nanother at the day of judgment. I have ordered an honest coffin of oak\r\nplanks for you. Even the canons of the church of Panna Marya could not\r\nhave any better. You will not perish like a peasant. I will not permit\r\nthem to decapitate you on the same cloth on which they behead burghers. I\r\nhave made an agreement with Amylej, that he furnish a new cloth, so\r\nhandsome that it would be good enough to cover king's fur. I will not be\r\nmiserly with prayers, either; don't be afraid!\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko's heart rejoiced, and bending toward his uncle's hand, he\r\nrepeated:\r\n\r\n\"God will reward you!\"\r\n\r\nSometimes, however, notwithstanding all this consolation he was seized\r\nwith a feeling of dreadful loneliness; therefore, another time when Macko\r\ncame to see him, as soon as he had welcomed him, he asked him, looking\r\nthrough the grate in the wall:\r\n\r\n\"How is it outside?\"\r\n\r\n\"Beautiful weather, like gold, and the sun warms so that all the world is\r\npleased.\"\r\n\r\nHearing this, Zbyszko put both his hands on his neck, and raising his\r\nhead, said:\r\n\r\n\"Hej, Mighty God! To have a horse and to ride on fields, on large ones!\r\nIt is dreadful for a young man to perish! It is dreadful!\"\r\n\r\n\"People perish on horseback!\" answered Macko.\r\n\r\n\"Bah! But how many they kill before!\"\r\n\r\nAnd he began to ask about the knights whom he had seen at the king's\r\ncourt; about Zawisza, Farurej, Powala of Taczew, about Lis of Targowisko\r\nand about all the others; what they were doing; how they amused\r\nthemselves; in what honest exercises they passed the time? And he\r\nlistened with avidity to Macko who told him that in the morning, the\r\nknights dressed in their armor, jumped over horses, broke ropes, tried\r\none another's skill with swords and with axes having sharp ends made of\r\nlead; finally, he told how they feasted and what songs they sang. Zbyszko\r\nlonged with heart and soul to be with them, and when he learned that\r\nZawisza, immediately after the christening, intended to go somewhere\r\nbeyond Hungary, against the Turks, he could not refrain from exclaiming:\r\n\r\n\"If they would only let me go! It would be better to perish among the\r\npagans!\"\r\n\r\nBut this could not be done. In the meanwhile something else happened.\r\nBoth princesses of Mazowsze had not ceased to think about Zbyszko, who\r\nhad captivated them by his youth and beauty. Finally the Princess\r\nAlexandra Ziemowitowna decided to send a letter to the grand master. It\r\nwas true that the grand master could not alter the sentence, pronounced\r\nby the castellan; but he could intercede with the king in favor of the\r\nyouth. It was not right for Jagiello to show any clemency, because the\r\noffence was an attempt on the life of the envoy; but if the grand master\r\nbesought the king, then the king would pardon the lad. Therefore hope\r\nentered the hearts of both princesses. Princess Alexandra being fond of\r\nthe polished monk-knights, was a great favorite with them also. Very\r\noften they sent her from Marienburg, rich presents and letters in which\r\nthe master called her venerable, pious benefactress and the particular\r\nprotectress of the Order. Her words could do much; it was probable that\r\nher wishes would not be denied. The question now was to find a messenger,\r\nwho would be zealous enough to carry the letter as soon as possible and\r\nreturn immediately with the answer. Having heard this, the old Macko\r\ndetermined without any hesitation to do it.\r\n\r\nThe castellan promised to delay the execution. Full of hope, Macko set\r\nhimself to work the same day to prepare for the journey. Then he went to\r\nsee Zbyszko, to tell him the good news.\r\n\r\nAt first Zbyszko was filled with as great joy, as if they had already\r\nopened the door of the tower for him. But afterward he became thoughtful\r\nand gloomy, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Who can expect anything from the Germans! Lichtenstein also could ask\r\nthe king for clemency; and he could get some benefit from it because he\r\nwould thus avoid your vengeance; but he will not do anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is angry because we would not apologize on the road to Tyniec. The\r\npeople speak well about the master, Konrad. At any rate you will not lose\r\nanything by it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure,\" said Zbyszko, \"but do not bow too low to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall not. I am going with the letter from Princess Alexandra; that is\r\nall.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, as you are so kind, may God help you!\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly he looked sharply at his uncle and said:\r\n\r\n\"But If the king pardon me, Lichtenstein shall be mine, not yours.\r\nRemember!\"\r\n\r\n\"You are not yet sure about your neck, therefore don't make any promises.\r\nYou have enough of those stupid vows!\" said the angry old man.\r\n\r\nThen they threw themselves into each other's arms. Zbyszko remained\r\nalone. Hope and uncertainty tossed his soul by turns; but when night\r\ncame, and with it a storm, when the uncovered window was lighted by\r\nill-omened lightnings and the walls shook with the thunder, when finally\r\nthe whistling wind rushed into the tower, Zbyszko plunged, into darkness,\r\nagain lost confidence; all night he could not close his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I shall not escape death,\" he thought; \"nothing can help me!\"\r\n\r\nBut the next day, the worthy Princess Anna Januszowna came to see him,\r\nand brought Danusia who wore her little lute at her belt. Zbyszko fell at\r\ntheir feet; then, although he was in great distress, after a sleepless\r\nnight, in woe and uncertainty, he did not forget his duty as a knight and\r\nexpressed his surprise about Danusia's beauty.\r\n\r\nBut the princess looked at him sadly and said:\r\n\r\n\"You must not wonder at her; if Macko does not bring a favorable answer,\r\nor if he does not return at all, you will wonder at better things in\r\nheaven!\"\r\n\r\nThen she began to weep as she thought of the uncertain future of the\r\nlittle knight. Danusia wept also. Zbyszko kneeled again at their feet,\r\nbecause his heart became soft like heated wax in the presence of such\r\ngrief. He did not love Danusia as a man loves a woman; but he felt that\r\nhe loved her dearly. The sight of her had such an effect on him that he\r\nbecame like another man, less severe, less impetuous, less warlike.\r\nFinally great grief filled him because he must leave her before he could\r\naccomplish the vow which he had made to her.\r\n\r\n\"Poor child, I cannot put at your feet those peacock crests,\" said he.\r\n\"But when I stand in the presence of God, I will say: 'Lord, forgive me\r\nmy sins, and give _Panna_ Jurandowna of Spychow all riches on earth.'\"\r\n\r\n\"You met only a short time ago,\" said the princess. \"God will not grant\r\nit!\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko began to recollect the incident which occurred in Tyniec and his\r\nheart was melted. Finally he asked Danusia to sing for him the same song\r\nwhich she was singing when he seized her from the falling bench and\r\ncarried her to the princess.\r\n\r\nTherefore Danusia, although she did not feel like singing, raised her\r\nclosed eyes toward the vault and began:\r\n\r\n  \"If I only could get\r\n  The wings like a birdie,\r\n  I would fly quickly\r\n  To my dearest Jasiek!\r\n  I would then be seated\r\n  On the high enclosure:\r\n  Look my dear Jasiulku----\"\r\n\r\nBut suddenly the tears began to flow down her face, and she was unable to\r\nsing any more. Zbyszko seized her in his arms, as he had done in the inn\r\nat Tyniec and began to walk with her around the room, repeating in\r\necstasy:\r\n\r\n\"If God release me from this prison, when you grow up, if your father\r\ngive his consent, I will take you for my wife! Hej!\"\r\n\r\nDanusia embraced him and hid her face on his shoulder. His grief which\r\nbecame greater and greater, flowed from a rustic Slavonic nature, and\r\nchanged in that simple soul almost to a rustic song:\r\n\r\n  \"I will take you, girl!\r\n  I will take you!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nAn event now happened, compared with which all other affairs lost their\r\nimportance. Toward evening of the twenty-first of June, the news of the\r\nqueen's sudden illness spread throughout the castle. Bishop Wysz and the\r\nother doctors remained in her room the whole night. It was known that the\r\nqueen was threatened with premature confinement. The castellan of Krakow,\r\nJasko Topor of Tenczyn, sent a messenger to the absent king that same\r\nnight. The next day the news spread throughout the entire city and its\r\nenvirons. It was Sunday, therefore the churches were crowded. All doubt\r\nceased. After mass the guests and the knights, who had come to be present\r\nat the festivals, the nobles and the burghers, went to the castle; the\r\nguilds and the fraternities came out with their banners. From noontide\r\nnumberless crowds of people surrounded Wawel, but order was kept by the\r\nking's archers. The city was almost deserted; crowds of peasants moved\r\ntoward the castle to learn some news about the health of their beloved\r\nqueen. Finally there appeared in the principal gate, the bishops and the\r\ncastellan, and with them other canons, king's counselors and knights.\r\nThey mingled with the people telling them the news, but forbidding any\r\nloud manifestation of joy, because it would be injurious to the sick\r\nqueen. They announced to all, that the queen was delivered of a daughter.\r\nThis news filled the hearts of all with joy, especially when they\r\nlearned, that, although the confinement was premature, there was now no\r\ndanger, neither for the mother nor for the child. The people began to\r\ndisperse because it was forbidden to shout near the castle and everybody\r\nwished to manifest his joy. Therefore, the streets of the city were\r\nfilled immediately, and exulting songs and exclamations resounded in\r\nevery corner. They were not disappointed because a girl had been born.\r\n\"Was it unfortunate that King Louis had no sons and that Jadwiga became\r\nour queen? By her marriage with Jagiello, the strength of the kingdom was\r\ndoubled. The same will happen again. Where can one find a richer heiress\r\nthan our queen. Neither the Roman emperor nor any king possesses such\r\ndominion, nor so numerous a knighthood! There will be great competition\r\namong the monarchs for her hand; the most powerful of them will bow to\r\nour king and queen; they will come to Krakow, and we merchants will\r\nprofit by it; perhaps some new domains, Bohemian or Hungarian, will be\r\nadded to our kingdom.\"\r\n\r\nThus spoke the merchants among themselves, and their joy increased every\r\nmoment. They feasted in the private houses and in the inns. The market\r\nplace was filled with lanterns and torches. Almost till daybreak, there\r\nwas great life and animation throughout the city.\r\n\r\nDuring the morning, they heard more news from the castle.\r\n\r\nThey heard that the _ksiondz_ Bishop Peter, had baptized the child during\r\nthe night. On account of this, they feared that the little girl was not\r\nvery strong. But the experienced townswomen quoted some similar cases, in\r\nwhich the infants had grown stronger immediately after baptism. Therefore\r\nthey comforted themselves with this hope; their confidence was greatly\r\nincreased by the name given to the princess.\r\n\r\n\"Neither Bonifacius nor Bonifacia can die immediately after baptism; the\r\nchild so named is destined to accomplish something great,\" they said.\r\n\"During the first years, especially during the first weeks, the child\r\ncannot do anything good or bad.\"\r\n\r\nThe next day, however, there came bad news from the castle concerning the\r\ninfant and the mother, and the city was excited. During the whole day,\r\nthe churches were as crowded as they were during the time of absolution.\r\nVotive offerings were very numerous for the queen's and princess' health.\r\nOne could see poor peasants offering some grain, lambs, chickens, ropes\r\nof dried mushrooms or baskets of nuts. There came rich offerings from the\r\nknights, from the merchants and from the artisans. They sent messengers\r\nto the places where miracles were performed. Astrologers consulted the\r\nstars. In Krakow itself, they ordered numerous processions. All guilds\r\nand fraternities took part in them. There was also a children's\r\nprocession because the people thought that these innocent beings would be\r\nmore apt to obtain God's favor. Through the gates new crowds were coming.\r\n\r\nThus day after day passed, with continual ringing of bells, with the\r\nnoise of the crowds in the churches, with processions and with prayers.\r\nBut when at the end of a week, the beloved queen and the child were still\r\nliving, hope began to enter the hearts of the people. It seemed to them\r\nimpossible, that God would take from the kingdom the queen who, having\r\ndone so much for it, would thus be obliged to leave so much unfinished.\r\nThe scholars told how much she had done for the schools; the clergy, how\r\nmuch for God's glory; the statesmen, how much for peace among Christian\r\nmonarchs; the jurisconsults, how much for justice; the poor people, how\r\nmuch for poverty. None of them could believe that the life so necessary\r\nto the kingdom and to the whole world, would be ended prematurely.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile on July thirteenth, the tolling bells announced the\r\ndeath of the child. The people again swarmed through the streets of the\r\ncity, and uneasiness seized them. The crowd surrounded Wawel again,\r\ninquiring about the queen's health. But now nobody came out with good\r\nnews. On the contrary, the faces of the lords entering the castle, or\r\nreturning to the city, were gloomy, and every day became sadder. They\r\nsaid that the _ksiondz_ Stanislaw of Skarbimierz, the master of liberal\r\nsciences in Krakow, did not leave the queen, who every day received holy\r\ncommunion. They said also, that after every communion, her room was\r\nfilled with celestial light. Some had seen it through the windows; but\r\nsuch a sight frightened the hearts devoted to the lady; they feared that\r\nit was a sign that celestial life had already begun for her.\r\n\r\nBut everybody did not believe that such a dreadful thing could happen;\r\nthey reassured themselves with the hope that the justice of heaven would\r\nbe satisfied with one victim. But on Friday morning, July seventeenth,\r\nthe news spread among the people that the queen was in agony. Everybody\r\nrushed toward Wawel. The city was deserted; even mothers with their\r\ninfants rushed toward the gates of the castle. The stores were closed;\r\nthey did not cook any food. All business was suspended; but around Wawel,\r\nthere was a sea of uneasy, frightened but silent people.\r\n\r\nAt last at the thirteenth hour from noontime, the bell on the tower of\r\nthe cathedral resounded. They did not immediately understand what it\r\nmeant; but the people became uneasy. All heads and all eyes turned toward\r\nthe tower in which was hung the tolling bell; its mournful tones were\r\nsoon repeated by other bells in the city: by those at Franciscans, at\r\nTrinity, and at Panna Marya. Finally the people understood; then their\r\nsouls were filled with dread and with great grief. At last a large black\r\nflag embroidered with a death's head, appeared on the tower. Then all\r\ndoubt vanished: the queen had rendered her soul to God.\r\n\r\nBeneath the castle walls resounded the roar and the cries of a hundred\r\nthousand people and mingled with the gloomy voices of the bells. Some of\r\nthe people threw themselves on the ground; others tore their clothing or\r\nlacerated their faces; while others looked at the walls with silent\r\nstupefaction. Some of them were moaning; some, stretching their hands\r\ntoward the church and toward the queen's room, asked for a miracle and\r\nGod's mercy. But there were also heard some angry voices, which on\r\naccount of despair were verging toward blasphemy:\r\n\r\n\"Why have they taken our dear queen? For what then were our processions,\r\nour prayers and our entreaties? Our gold and silver offerings were\r\naccepted and we have nothing in return for them! They took but they gave\r\nus nothing in return!\" Many others weeping, repeated: \"Jesus! Jesus!\r\nJesus!\" The crowds wanted to enter the castle, to look once more on the\r\nface of their queen.\r\n\r\nThis they were not permitted to do; but were promised that the body would\r\nsoon be placed in the church where everyone would be allowed to view it\r\nand to pray beside it. Consequently toward evening, the sorrowing people\r\nbegan to return to the city, talking about the queen's last moments,\r\nabout the future funeral and the miracles, which would be performed near\r\nher body and around her tomb. Some also said that immediately after her\r\nburial, the queen would be canonized, and when others said that they\r\ndoubted if it could be done, many began to be angry and to threaten to go\r\nto the pope in Avignon.\r\n\r\nA gloomy sorrow fell upon the city, and upon the whole country, not only\r\non the common people, but on everybody; the lucky star of the kingdom was\r\nextinguished. Even to many among the lords, everything looked black. They\r\nbegan to ask themselves and others, what would happen now? whether the\r\nking had the right to remain after the queen's death and rule over the\r\ncountry; or whether he would return to Lithuania and be satisfied with\r\nthe throne of the viceroy? Some of them supposed--and the future proved\r\nthat they thought correctly--that the king himself would be willing to\r\nwithdraw; and that, in such an event the large provinces would separate\r\nfrom the crown, and the Lithuanians would again begin their attacks\r\nagainst the inhabitants of the kingdom. The Knights of the Cross would\r\nbecome stronger; mightier would become the Roman emperor and the\r\nHungarian king; and the Polish kingdom, one of the mightiest until\r\nyesterday, would be ruined and disgraced.\r\n\r\nThe merchants, for whom waste territories in Lithuania and in Russia had\r\nbeen opened, forseeing great losses, made pious vows, hoping that\r\nJagiello might remain on the throne. But in that event, they predicted a\r\nwar with the Order. It was known that the queen only could restrain his\r\nanger. The people recollected a previous occasion, when being indignant\r\nat the avidity and rapacity of the Knights of the Cross, she spoke to\r\nthem in a prophetic vision: \"As long as I live, I will restrain my\r\nhusband's hand and his righteous anger; but remember that after my death,\r\nthere will fall upon you the punishment for your sins.\"\r\n\r\nIn their pride and folly, they were not afraid of a war, calculating,\r\nthat after the queen's death, the charm of her piety would no longer\r\nrestrain the wish for affluence of volunteers from eastern countries, and\r\nthat then thousands of warriors from Germany, Burgundia, France and other\r\ncountries, would join the Knights of the Cross.\r\n\r\nThe death of Jadwiga was an event of such importance, that the envoy\r\nLichtenstein, could wait no longer for the answer of the absent king; but\r\nstarted immediately for Marienburg, in order to communicate as soon as\r\npossible to the grand master and to the chapter the important, and in\r\nsome ways, threatening news.\r\n\r\nThe Hungarian, the Austrian and the Bohemian envoys followed him or sent\r\nmessengers to their monarchs. Jagiello returned to Krakow in great\r\ndespair. At first he declared to the lords, that he did not wish to rule\r\nwithout the queen and that he would return to Litwa. Afterward, on\r\naccount of his grief, he fell into such a stupor, that he could not\r\nattend to any affairs of state, and could not answer any questions.\r\nSometimes he was very angry with himself, because he had gone away, and\r\nhad not been present at the queen's death to bid her farewell and to hear\r\nher last words and wishes. In vain Stanislaw of Skarbimierz and Bishop\r\nWysz explained to him that the queen's illness came suddenly, and that\r\naccording to human calculations he would have had plenty of time to go\r\nand return if the confinement had occurred at the expected time. These\r\nwords did not bring him any consolation; did not assuage his grief. \"I am\r\nno king without her,\" he answered the bishop; \"only a repentant sinner,\r\nwho can receive no consolation!\" After that he looked at the ground and\r\nno one could induce him to speak even one word.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile preparations for the queen's funeral occupied all minds. From\r\nall over the country, great crowds of lords, nobles and peasants were\r\ngoing to Krakow. The body of the queen was placed in the cathedral on an\r\nelevation, so arranged that the end of the coffin in which the queen's\r\nhead rested, was much higher than the other end. It was so arranged\r\npurposely, to enable the people to see the queen's face. In the cathedral\r\ncontinual prayers were offered; around the catafalque thousands of wax\r\ncandles were burning. In the glare of the candles and among the flowers,\r\nshe lay quiet and smiling, looking like a mystic rose. The people saw in\r\nher a saint; they brought to her those possessed with devils, the\r\ncrippled and the sick children. From time to time there was heard in the\r\nchurch, the exclamation of some mother who perceived the color return to\r\nthe face of her sick child; or the joyful voice of some paralytic man who\r\nat once was cured. Then human hearts trembled and the news spread\r\nthroughout the church, the castle, and the city, and attracted more and\r\nmore of such human wretchedness as only from a miracle could expect help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nDuring this time Zbyszko was entirely forgotten. Who in the time of such\r\nsorrow and misfortune, could remember about the noble lad or about his\r\nimprisonment in the tower of the castle? Zbyszko had heard, however, from\r\nthe guards, about the queen's illness. He had heard the noise of the\r\npeople around the castle; when he heard their weeping and the tolling of\r\nthe bells, he threw himself on his knees, and having forgotten about his\r\nown lot, began to mourn the death of the worshipped lady. It seemed to\r\nhim, that with her, something died within him and that after her death,\r\nthere was nothing worth living for in this world.\r\n\r\nThe echo of the funeral--the church bells, the processional songs and the\r\nlamenting of the crowd,--was heard for several weeks. During that time,\r\nhe grew gloomier, lost his appetite, could not sleep and walked in his\r\nunderground cell like a wild beast in a cage. He suffered in solitude;\r\nthere were often days during which the jailer did not bring him food nor\r\nwater. So much was everybody engaged with the queen's funeral, that after\r\nher death nobody came to see him: neither the princess, nor Danusia, nor\r\nPowala of Taczew, nor the merchant Amylej. Zbyszko thought with\r\nbitterness, that as soon as Macko left the city, everybody forgot about\r\nhim. Sometimes he thought that perhaps the law would forget about him\r\nalso, and that he would putrefy in the prison till death. Then he prayed\r\nfor death.\r\n\r\nFinally, when after the queen's funeral one month passed, and the second\r\ncommenced, he began to doubt if Macko would ever return. Macko had\r\npromised to ride quickly and not to spare his horse. Marienburg was not\r\nat the other end of the world. One could reach it and return in twelve\r\nweeks, especially if one were in haste. \"But perhaps he has not hurried!\"\r\nthought Zbyszko, bitterly; \"perhaps he has found some woman whom he will\r\ngladly conduct to Bogdaniec, and beget his own progeny while I must wait\r\nhere centuries for God's mercy.\"\r\n\r\nFinally he lost all trace of time, and ceased altogether to talk with the\r\njailer. Only by the spider web thickly covering the iron grating of the\r\nwindow, did he know that fall was near at hand. Whole hours he sat on his\r\nbed, his elbows resting on his knees, his fingers in his long hair. Half\r\ndreaming and stiff, he did not raise his head even when the warden\r\nbringing him food, spoke to him. But at last one day the bolts of the\r\ndoor creaked, and a familiar voice called him from the threshold;\r\n\r\n\"Zbyszku!\"\r\n\r\n\"Uncle!\" exclaimed Zbyszko, rushing from the bed.\r\n\r\nMacko seized him in his arms, and began to kiss his fair head. Grief,\r\nbitterness and loneliness had so filled the heart of the youth, that he\r\nbegan to cry on his uncle's breast like a little child.\r\n\r\n\"I thought you would never come back,\" said he, sobbing.\r\n\r\n\"That came near being true,\" answered Macko.\r\n\r\nNow Zbyszko raised his head and having looked at him, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"What was the matter with you?\"\r\n\r\nHe looked with amazement at the emaciated and pallid face of the old\r\nwarrior, at his bent figure and his gray hair.\r\n\r\n\"What was the matter with you?\" he repeated.\r\n\r\nMacko sat on the bed and for a while breathed heavily.\r\n\r\n\"What was the matter?\" said he, finally.\r\n\r\n\"Hardly had I passed the frontier, before the Germans whom I met in the\r\nforest, wounded me with a crossbow. _Raubritters!_ You know! I cannot\r\nbreathe! God sent me help, otherwise you would not see me here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who rescued you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Jurand of Spychow,\" answered Macko.\r\n\r\nThere was a moment of silence.\r\n\r\n\"They attacked me; but half a day later he attacked them and hardly half\r\nof them escaped. He took me with him to the _grodek_ and then to Spychow.\r\nI fought with death for three weeks. God did not let me die and although\r\nI am not well yet, I have returned.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you have not been in Malborg?\"\r\n\r\n\"On what would I ride? They robbed me of everything and they took the\r\nletter with the other things. I returned to ask Princess Ziemowitowa for\r\nanother; but I have not met her yet, and whether I will see her or not, I\r\ndo not know. I must prepare for the other world!\"\r\n\r\nHaving said this, he spit on the palm of his hand and stretching it\r\ntoward Zbyszko, showed him blood on it, saying:\r\n\r\n\"Do you see?\"\r\n\r\nAfter a while he added:\r\n\r\n\"It must be God's will.\"\r\n\r\nThey were both silent for a time under the burden of their gloomy\r\nthoughts; then Zbyszko said:\r\n\r\n\"Then you spit blood continually?\"\r\n\r\n\"How can I help it; there is a spear head half a span long between my\r\nribs. You would spit also! I was a little better before I left Jurand of\r\nSpychow; but now I am very tired, because the way was long and I\r\nhastened.\"\r\n\r\n\"He; I why did you hasten?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I wished to see Princess Alexandra and get another letter from\r\nher. Jurand of Spychow said 'Go and bring the letter to Spychow. I have a\r\nfew Germans imprisoned here. I will free one of them if he promise upon\r\nhis knightly word to carry the letter to the gland master.' For vengeance\r\nfor his wife's death, he always keeps several German captives and listens\r\njoyfully when they moan and their chains rattle. He is a man full of\r\nhatred. Understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand. But I wonder that you did not recover the lost letter, if\r\nJurand captured those who attacked you.\"\r\n\r\n\"He did not capture all of them. Five or six escaped. Such is our lot!\"\r\n\r\n\"How did they attack you? From ambush?\"\r\n\r\n\"From behind such thick bushes that one could see nothing. I was riding\r\nwithout armor, because the merchants told me that the country was safe,\r\nand it was warm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who was at the head of the robbers? A Krzyzak?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a friar, but a German. Chelminczyk of Lentz, famous for his\r\nrobberies on the highway.\"\r\n\r\n\"What became of him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Jurand chained him. But he has in his dungeons two noblemen, Mazurs,\r\nwhom he wishes to exchange for himself.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a moment of silence.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Jesus,\" Zbyszko said, finally; \"Lichtenstein is alive, and also\r\nthat robber from Lentz; but we must perish without vengeance. They will\r\nbehead me and you will not be able to live through the winter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah! I will not live even until winter. If I could only help you in some\r\nway to escape.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you seen anybody here?\"\r\n\r\n\"I went to see the castellan of Krakow. When I learned that Lichtenstein\r\nhad departed, I thought perhaps the castellan would be less severe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then Lichtenstein went away?\"\r\n\r\n\"Immediately after the queen's death, he went to Marienburg. I went to\r\nsee the castellan; but he answered me thus: 'They will execute your\r\nnephew, not to please Lichtenstein, but because that is his sentence. It\r\nwill make no difference whether Lichtenstein be here or not. Even if he\r\ndie, nothing will be changed; the law is according to justice and not\r\nlike a jacket, which you can turn inside out. The king can show clemency;\r\nbut no one else.'\"\r\n\r\n\"And where is the king?\"\r\n\r\n\"After the funeral he went to Rus'.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then there is no hope at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\" The castellan said still further: \"I pity him, because the Princess\r\nAnna begs for his pardon, but I cannot, I cannot!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then Princess Anna is still here?\"\r\n\r\n\"May God reward her! She is a good lady. She is still here, because\r\nJurandowna is sick, and the princess loves her as her own child.\"\r\n\r\n\"For God's sake! Then Danusia is sick! What is the matter with her?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know! The princess says that somebody has thrown a spell over\r\nher.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure it is Lichtenstein! Nobody else,--only Lichtenstein--a\r\ndog-brother!\"\r\n\r\n\"It may be he. But what can you do to him? Nothing!\"\r\n\r\n\"That is why they all seemed to have forgotten me here; she was sick.\"\r\n\r\nHaving said this, Zbyszko began to walk up and down the room; finally he\r\nseized Macko's hand, kissed it, and said:\r\n\r\n\"May God reward you for everything! If you die, I will be the cause of\r\nyour death. Before you get any worse, you must do one thing more. Go to\r\nthe castellan and beg him to release me, on my knightly word, for twelve\r\nweeks. After that time I will return, and they may behead me. But it must\r\nnot be that we both die without vengeance. You know! I will go to\r\nMarienburg, and immediately send a challenge to Lichtenstein. It cannot\r\nbe otherwise. One of us must die!\"\r\n\r\nMacko began to rub his forehead.\r\n\r\n\"I will go; but will the castellan permit?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will give my knightly word. For twelve weeks--I do not need more.\"\r\n\r\n\"No use to talk; twelve weeks! And if you are wounded, you cannot return;\r\nwhat will they think then?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will return if I have to crawl. But don't be afraid! In the meanwhile\r\nthe king may return and one will be able to beseech him for clemency.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true,\" answered Macko.\r\n\r\nBut after awhile he added:\r\n\r\n\"The castellan also told me this: 'On account of the queen's death, we\r\nforgot about your nephew; but now his sentence must be executed.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Ej, he will permit,\" answered Zbyszko, hopefully. \"He knows that a\r\nnobleman will keep his word, and it is just the same to him, whether they\r\nbehead me now, or after St. Michael's day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha! I will go to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"You better go to Amylej to-day, and rest awhile. He will bandage your\r\nwound, and to-morrow you can go to the castellan.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, with God then!\"\r\n\r\n\"With God!\"\r\n\r\nThey hugged each other and Macko turned toward the door; but he stopped\r\non the threshold and frowned as if he remembered something unpleasant.\r\n\r\n\"Bah, but you do not yet wear the girdle of a knight; Lichtenstein will\r\ntell you that he will not fight with you; what can you do then?\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko was filled with sorrow, but only for a moment, then he said:\r\n\r\n\"How is it during war? Is it necessary that a knight choose only\r\nknights?\"\r\n\r\n\"War is war; a single combat is quite different.\"\r\n\r\n\"True, but wait. You must find some way. Well, there is a way! Prince\r\nJanusz will dub me a knight. If the princess and Danusia ask him, he will\r\ndo it. In the meantime I will fight in Mazowsze with the son of Mikolaj\r\nof Dlugolas.\"\r\n\r\n\"What for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because Mikolaj, the same who is with the princess and whom they call\r\nObuch, called Danusia, 'bush.'\"\r\n\r\nMacko looked at him in amazement. Zbyszko, wishing to explain better\r\nabout what had occurred, said further:\r\n\r\n\"I cannot forgive that, but I cannot fight with Mikolaj, because he must\r\nbe nearly eighty years old.\"\r\n\r\nTo this Macko said:\r\n\r\n\"Listen! It is a pity that you should lose your head; but there will not\r\nbe a great loss of brains, because you are stupid like a goat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why are you angry?\"\r\n\r\nMacko did not answer, but started to leave. Zbyszko sprang toward him and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"How is Danusia? Is she well yet? Don't be angry for a trifle. You have\r\nbeen absent so long!\"\r\n\r\nAgain he bent toward the old man who shrugged his shoulders and said\r\nmildly:\r\n\r\n\"Jurandowna is well, only they will not let her go out of her room yet.\r\nGood-bye!\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko remained alone, but he felt as if he had been regenerated. He\r\nrejoiced to think that he might be allowed to live three months more. He\r\ncould go to remote lands; he could find Lichtenstein, and engage in\r\ndeadly combat with him. Even the thought about that filled him with joy.\r\nHe would be fortunate, to be able to ride a horse, even for twelve weeks;\r\nto be able to fight and not perish without vengeance. And then--let\r\nhappen what would happen--it would be a long time anyhow! The king might\r\nreturn and forgive him. War might break out, and the castellan himself\r\nwhen he saw the victor of the proud Lichtenstein, might say: \"Go now into\r\nthe woods and the fields!\"\r\n\r\nTherefore a great hope entered his heart. He did not think that they\r\nwould refuse to grant him those three months. He thought that perhaps\r\nthey would grant hem more. The old _Pan_ of Tenczyn would never admit\r\nthat a nobleman could not keep his word.\r\n\r\nTherefore when Macko came to the prison, the next day toward evening,\r\nZbyszko, who could hardly sit quiet, sprang toward him and asked:\r\n\r\n\"Granted?\"\r\n\r\nMacko sat on the truckle-bed, because he could not stand on account of\r\nhis feebleness; for a while he breathed heavily and finally said:\r\n\r\n\"The castellan said: 'If you wish to divide your land, or attend to your\r\nhousehold, then I will release your nephew for a week or two on his\r\nknightly word, but for no longer.'\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko was so much surprised, that for a while he could not say a word.\r\n\r\n\"For two weeks?\" asked he, finally. \"But I could not even reach the\r\nfrontier in two weeks! How is it? You did not tell the castellan why I\r\nwished to go to Marienburg?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not only I, but the Princess Anna begged for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what then?\"\r\n\r\n\"What? The old man told her that he did not want your head, and that he\r\npitied you. 'If I could find,' said he, 'some law in his favor, or only a\r\npretext, I would release him altogether; but I cannot. There would be no\r\norder in a country in which the people shut their eyes to the law, and\r\nacted according to friendship; I will not do it; even if it were\r\nToporczyk, who is a relative of mine, or even my own brother, I would\r\nnot. Such hard people are here!' And he said still further; 'We do not\r\ncare about the Knights of the Cross; but we cannot bring reproach on\r\nourselves. What would they think of us, and all our guests, coming from\r\nall parts of the world, if I release a nobleman sentenced to death, in\r\norder to give him a chance to fight? Would they believe that he will be\r\npunished, and that there is some law in our country? I prefer to order\r\none head cut off, than to bring contempt on the king and the kingdom.'\r\nThe princess told him that that was strange justice, from which even a\r\nking's relative could not obtain anything by her prayer; but the old man\r\nanswered: 'The king may use clemency; but he will not tolerate\r\nlawlessness.' Then they began to quarrel because the princess grew very\r\nangry: 'Then,' said she, 'don't keep him in the prison!' And the\r\ncastellan replied to this: 'Very well! To-morrow I will order a scaffold\r\nbuilt on the market square.' Then they departed. Only the Lord Jesus can\r\nhelp you.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a long moment of silence.\r\n\r\n\"What?\" he said, gloomily. \"Then it will be immediately?\"\r\n\r\n\"In two or three days. There is no help. I have done what I could. I fell\r\nat the castellan's knees; I implored him for mercy, but he repeated:\r\n'Find a law, or a pretext.' But what can I find? I went to see the\r\n_ksiondz_ Stanislaw of Skarbimierz, and I begged him to come to you. At\r\nleast you will have this honor, that the same priest who heard the\r\nqueen's confession will hear yours. But I did not find him home; he had\r\ngone to Princess Anna.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps for Danusia!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all. The girl is better. I will go see him to-morrow early in the\r\nmorning. They say that if he bears one's confession, salvation is as sure\r\nas if you had it in your pocket.\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko put his elbows on his knees and dropped his head so that his hair\r\ncovered his face entirely. The old man looked at him a long time and\r\nfinally began to call him softly:\r\n\r\n\"Zbyszku! Zbyszku!\"\r\n\r\nThe boy raised his head. His face had an expression of anger and of cold\r\nhatred, but not of weakness.\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen carefully; perhaps I have found a way of escape.\"\r\n\r\nHaving said this, he approached and began to whisper:\r\n\r\n\"Have your heard about Prince Witold, who at one time, being imprisoned\r\nby our king in Krewo, went out from the prison disguised in a woman's\r\ndress. There is no woman who will remain here instead of you, but take my\r\n_kubrak_.[57] Take my cowl and go--understand? They will not notice. It\r\nis dark behind the door. They will not flash a light into your eyes. They\r\nsaw me yesterday going out; but they did not look at me closely. Be quiet\r\nand listen. They will find me here to-morrow--and what then? Will they\r\ncut my head off? That will be no satisfaction, because I will die anyhow\r\nin three or four weeks. And you, as soon as you are out of here, to\r\nhorse, and go straight to Prince Witold. You will present yourself to\r\nhim; you will bow before him; he will receive you and you will be as safe\r\nwith him as if you were sitting at God's right hand. They say here that\r\nthe _kniaz_'s armies have been defeated by the Tartars, because the late\r\nqueen prophesied defeat. If it be true, the _kniaz_ will need soldiers\r\nand he will welcome you. You must remain with him, because there is no\r\nbetter service in the world. If our king were defeated in a war, it would\r\nbe his end; but there is such an amount of shrewdness in _Kniaz_ Witold,\r\nthat after a defeat he grows still more powerful. And he is liberal also,\r\nand he loves our family. Tell him everything that happened. Tell him that\r\nyou wanted to go with him against the Tartars; but you could not because\r\nyou were imprisoned in the tower. If God permit, he will give you some\r\nland and peasants; he will dub you a knight and he will intercede for you\r\nwith the king. He is a good protector--you will see!--What?\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko listened silently, and Macko, as if he was excited by his own\r\nwords, spoke further:\r\n\r\n\"You must not perish young, but return to Bogdaniec. And when you return,\r\nyou must immediately take a wife so that our family does not perish. Only\r\nwhen you have children, may you challenge Lichtenstein to fight until\r\ndeath; but before that, you must abstain from seeking vengeance. Take my\r\n_kubrak_ now, take my cowl and go, in God's name.\"\r\n\r\nHaving said this, Macko stood up and began to undress; but Zbyszko arose\r\nalso, stopped him and said:\r\n\r\n\"I will not do it, so help me God and Holy Cross.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" asked Macko, astonished.\r\n\r\n\"Because I will not!\"\r\n\r\nMacko became pale with anger.\r\n\r\n\"I wish you had never been born!\"\r\n\r\n\"You told the castellan,\" said Zbyszko, \"that you would give your head in\r\nexchange for mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know that?\"\r\n\r\n\"The _Pan_ of Taczew told me.\"\r\n\r\n\"What of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"What of it? The castellan told you that disgrace would fall on me and on\r\nall my family Would it not be a still greater disgrace, if I escaped from\r\nhere, and left you to the vengeance of the law?\"\r\n\r\n\"What vengeance? What can the law do to me, when I must die just the\r\nsame? Have common sense, for God's mercy!\"\r\n\r\n\"May God punish me if I abandon you now when you are old and sick. Tfu!\r\nshame!\"\r\n\r\nThere was silence; one could only hear the heavy, hoarse breathing of\r\nMacko, and the archers' calls.\r\n\r\n\"Listen,\" Macko said, finally, in broken tones, \"it was not shameful for\r\n_Kniaz_ Witold to escape from Krewo; it would not be for you, either.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hej!\"' answered Zbyszko, with sadness \"You know! _Kniaz_ Witold is a\r\ngreat _kniaz_; he received a crown from the king's hand, also riches and\r\ndominion; but I, a poor nobleman, have only my honor.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a while he exclaimed in a sudden burst of anger:\r\n\r\n\"Then you do not understand that I love you, and that I will not give\r\nyour head instead of mine?\"\r\n\r\nAt this, Macko stood on his trembling feet, stretched out his hands, and\r\nalthough the nature of the people of those days, was hard, as if forged\r\nof iron, he cried suddenly in a heartbroken voice:\r\n\r\n\"Zbyszku!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nThe next day, the court servants began to make preparations in the market\r\nsquare, to build the scaffold which was to be erected opposite the\r\nprincipal gate of the city hall.\r\n\r\nThe princess, however, was still consulting with Wojciech Jastrzembiec,\r\nStanislaw of Skarbimierz and other learned canons, who were familiar with\r\nthe written laws and also with the laws sanctioned by custom.\r\n\r\nShe was encouraged in these efforts by the castellan's words, when he\r\nsaid, that if they showed him \"law or pretext,\" he would free Zbyszko.\r\nTherefore they consulted earnestly, to ascertain if there were any law or\r\ncustom that would do. Although the _ksiondz_ Stanislaw, had prepared\r\nZbyszko for death and administered the last sacraments, he went directly\r\nfrom the prison to the consultation, which lasted almost till daybreak.\r\n\r\nThe day of execution arrived. From early morning, crowds of people had\r\nbegun to gather on the market square, because the decapitation of a\r\nnobleman excited more curiosity than that of a common criminal. The\r\nweather was beautiful. News of the youth and great beauty of the\r\nsentenced man, spread among the women. Therefore the whole road leading\r\nto the castle, was filled with crowds of townswomen, dressed in their\r\nbest; in the windows on the market square, and on the balconies, could be\r\nseen velvet bonnets, or the fair heads of young girls, ornamented only\r\nwith wreaths of lilies and roses. The city councilors, although the\r\naffair did not belong in their jurisdiction, all appeared, in order to\r\nshow their importance and placed themselves near the scaffold. The\r\nknights, wishing to show their sympathy for the young man, gathered in\r\ngreat numbers around the elevation. Behind them swarmed the gayly dressed\r\ncrowd, composed of small merchants and artisans dressed in their guild\r\ncostumes. Over this compact mass of human heads, one could see the\r\nscaffold which was covered with new broadcloth. On the elevation stood\r\nthe executioner, a German, with broad shoulders, dressed in a red\r\n_kubrak_ and on his head a cowl of the same color; he carried a heavy\r\ntwo-edged sword; with him were two of his assistants with naked arms and\r\nropes at their girdles. There were also a block and a coffin covered with\r\nbroadcloth. In Panna Maryia's tower, the bells were ringing, filling the\r\ntown with metallic sounds and scaring the flocks of doves and jackdaws.\r\nThe people looked at the scaffold, and at the executioner's sword\r\nprotruding from it and shining in the sun. They also looked at the\r\nknights, on whom the burghers always gazed with respect and eagerness.\r\nThis time it was worth while looking at them. The most famous knights\r\nwere standing round the elevation. They admired the broad shoulders and\r\ndark hair, falling in abundant curls of Zawisza Czarny; they admired the\r\nshort square figure of Zyndram of Maszkow as well as the gigantic stature\r\nof Paszko Zlodziej of Biskupice; the threatening face of Wojciech of\r\nWodzinek and the great beauty of Dobko of Olesnica, who at the tournament\r\nin Torun had defeated twelve knights; they looked admiringly at Zygmunt\r\nof Bobowa, who became equally famous in Koszyce in a fight with the\r\nHungarians, at Krzon of Kozieglowy, at Lis of Targowisko, who was\r\nvictorious in duels, and at Staszko of Charbimowice who was able to catch\r\na running horse.\r\n\r\nGeneral attention was also attracted by the pale face of Macko of\r\nBogdanice; he was supported by Floryan of Korytnica and Marcin of\r\nWrocimowice. It was generally thought that he was the sentenced man's\r\nfather.\r\n\r\nBut the greatest curiosity was aroused by Powala of Taczew who, standing\r\nin front, was holding Danusia, dressed in white, with a wreath of green\r\nrue resting on her fair hair. The people did not understand what it\r\nmeant, nor why this young girl was present to look at the execution. Some\r\nof them thought she was a sister; others, that she was the knight's lady;\r\nbut none were able to explain the meaning of her dress or of her presence\r\nat the scaffold. The sight of her fair face covered with tears, aroused\r\ncommiseration and emotion. The people began to criticise the castellan's\r\nstubbornness, and the severity of the laws. Those criticisms gradually\r\nchanged to threats. Finally, here and there, some voices were heard to\r\nsay, that if the scaffold were destroyed, then the execution would be\r\npostponed.\r\n\r\nThe crowd became eager and excited. They said that if the king were\r\npresent, he would surely pardon the youth.\r\n\r\nBut all became quiet when distant shoutings announced the approach of the\r\nking's archers, escorting the prisoner. The procession soon appeared in\r\nthe market square. It was preceded by a funeral fraternity, the members\r\nof which were dressed in long black cloaks, and were covered with veils\r\nof the same color, which had openings cut for the eyes. The people were\r\nafraid of these gloomy figures and became silent. They were followed by a\r\ndetachment of soldiers, armed with crossbows, and dressed in elk-skin\r\njerkins; these were the king's Lithuanian guards. Behind them one could\r\nsee the halberds of another detachment of soldiers. In the centre,\r\nbetween the clerk of the court, who was going to read the sentence, and\r\nthe _ksiondz_ Stanislaw of Skarbimierz who was carrying a crucifix,\r\nwalked Zbyszko.\r\n\r\nAll eyes now turned toward him, and at all the windows and from all the\r\nbalconies, women's heads protruded. Zbyszko was dressed in his white\r\n\"_jaka_,\" embroidered with golden griffins and ornamented with gold\r\ngaloon; in these magnificent clothes he looked like a young prince, or\r\nthe page of a wealthy court. His broad shoulders and chest and his\r\npowerful haunches indicated that he was already a full-grown man; but\r\nabove that strong figure of a man, appeared a childish face with down on\r\nthe upper lip. It was a beautiful face like that of a king's page, with\r\ngolden hair cut evenly over the eyebrows and falling on the shoulders. He\r\nwalked erect, but was very pale. From time to time he looked at the crowd\r\nas if he was dreaming; he looked at the church towers, toward the flocks\r\nof jackdaws, and at the bells, ringing his last hour; then his face\r\nexpressed amazement when he realized that the sobbing of the women, and\r\nall this solemnity was for him. Finally, he perceived the scaffold and\r\nthe executioner's red figure standing on it. Then he shivered and made\r\nthe sign of the Cross; the priest gave him the crucifix to kiss. A few\r\nsteps further, a bouquet of roses thrown by a young girl, fell at his\r\nfeet. Zbyszko stooped, picked up the bouquet and smiled at the girl who\r\nbegan to cry. But evidently he thought that, amidst these crowds and in\r\nthe presence of these women, waving their kerchiefs from the windows, he\r\nmust die courageously and at least leave behind him the reputation of \"a\r\nbrave man;\" therefore he strained his courage and will to the utmost.\r\nWith a sudden movement, he threw his hair back, raised his head still\r\nhigher and walked proudly, almost like a conqueror, whom, according to\r\nknightly custom, they conduct to get the prize. The procession advanced\r\nslowly, because the crowd was dense and unwillingly made way. In vain the\r\nLithuanian guard, marching in front, shouted: \"_Eyk szalin! Eyk szalin!_\r\ngo away!\" The people did not wish to understand these words, and\r\nsurrounded the soldiers more closely. Although about one-third of the\r\nburghers of Krakow were Germans, still there were heard on all sides,\r\nthreats against the Knights of the Cross: \"Shame! Shame! May they perish,\r\nthose wolves! Must they cut off children's heads for them! Shame on the\r\nking and on the kingdom!\" The Lithuanians seeing the resistance, took\r\ntheir crossbows from their shoulders, and menaced the crowd; but they did\r\nnot dare to attack without orders. The captain sent some men to open the\r\nway with their halberds and in that manner they reached the knights\r\nstanding around the scaffold.\r\n\r\nThey stepped aside without any resistance. The men with halberds entered\r\nfirst, and were followed by Zbyszko, accompanied by the priest and the\r\nclerk of the court. At that moment something happened which nobody had\r\nexpected. From among the knights, Powala stepped forward with Danusia in\r\nhis arms and shouted: \"Stop!\" with such a powerful voice, that the\r\nretinue stopped at once, as if rooted to the ground. Neither the captain,\r\nnor any of the soldiers dared to oppose the lord and knight, whom they\r\nwere accustomed to see every day in the castle and often in confidential\r\nconversation with the king. Finally, other knights, equally\r\ndistinguished, also began to shout with commanding voices:\r\n\r\n\"Stop! Stop!\" In the meantime, the _Pan_ of Taczew approached Zbyszko and\r\nhanded Danusia to him.\r\n\r\nZbyszko caught her in his arms and pressed her to his chest, bidding her\r\nfarewell; but Danusia instead of nestling to him and embracing him,\r\nimmediately took her white veil from her head and wrapped it around\r\nZbyszko's head, and began to cry in her tearful, childish voice:\r\n\r\n\"He is mine! He is mine!\"\r\n\r\n\"He is hers!\" shouted the powerful voices of the knights. \"To the\r\ncastellan!\"\r\n\r\nA shout, like the roar of thunder, answered: \"To the castellan! To the\r\ncastellan!\" The priest raised his eyes, the clerk looked confused, the\r\ncaptain and his soldiers dropped their arms; everybody understood what\r\nhad happened.\r\n\r\nThere was an old Polish and Slavonic custom, as strong as the law, known\r\nin Podhale, around Krakow, and even further. If a young girl threw her\r\nveil on a man conducted to death, as a sign that she wished to marry him,\r\nby so doing she saved his life. The knights, farmers, villagers and\r\ntownsmen all knew this custom; and the Germans living in the old cities\r\nand towns, had heard about it. The old man, Macko, almost fainted with\r\nemotion; the knights having pushed away the guards, surrounded Zbyszko\r\nand Danusia; the joyful people shouted again and again: \"To the\r\ncastellan! To the castellan!\"\r\n\r\nThe crowd moved suddenly, like the waves of the sea. The executioner and\r\nhis assistants rushed down from the scaffold. Everybody understood that\r\nif Jasko of Tenczyn resisted the custom, there would be a riot in the\r\ncity. In fact the people now rushed to the scaffold. In the twinkling of\r\nan eye, they pulled off the cloth and tore it into pieces; then the beams\r\nand planks, pulled by strong arms, or cut with axes, began to crack, then\r\na crash, and a few moments later there was not a trace left of the\r\nscaffold.\r\n\r\nZbyszko, holding Danusia in his arms, was going to the castle, but this\r\ntime like a true victor,--triumphant. With him were marching joyfully the\r\nmost noted knights in the kingdom; thousands of men, women and children\r\nwere shouting and singing, stretching their arms toward Danusia and\r\npraising the beauty and courage of both. At the windows the townswomen\r\nwere clasping their hands, and everywhere one could see faces covered\r\nwith tears of joy. A shower of roses, lilies, ribbons and even gold rings\r\nwere thrown to the lucky youth; he, beaming like the sun, with his heart\r\nfull of gratitude, embraced his sweet lady from time to time and\r\nsometimes kissed her hands. This sight made the townswomen feel so\r\ntender, that some of them threw themselves into the arms of their lovers,\r\ntelling them that if they encountered death, they also would be freed.\r\nZbyszko and Danusia became the beloved children of the knights, burghers\r\nand common people. Macko, whom Floryan of Korytnica and Marcin of\r\nWrocimowice were assisting to walk, was almost beside himself with joy.\r\nHe wondered why he had not even thought about this means of assistance.\r\nAmidst the general bustle, Powala of Taczew told the knights that this\r\nremedy had been discovered by Wojciech Jastrzembiec and Stanislaw of\r\nSkarbimierz, both experts in the written laws and customs. The knights\r\nwere all amazed at its simplicity, saying among themselves, that nobody\r\nelse would have thought about that custom, because the city was inhabited\r\nby Germans, and it had not been used for a long time.\r\n\r\nEverything, however, still depended on the castellan. The knights and the\r\npeople went to the castle, which was occupied by _Pan_ Krakowski during\r\nthe king's absence. The clerk of the court, the _ksiondz_ Stanislaw of\r\nSkarbimierz, Zawisza, Farurej, Zyndram of Maszkow and Powala of Taczew\r\nexplained to him the power of the custom and reminded him of what he had\r\nsaid himself, that if he found \"law or pretext,\" then he would release\r\nthe prisoner immediately. And could there be any better law, than the old\r\ncustom which had never been abolished?\r\n\r\nThe _Pan_ of Tenczyn answered that this custom applied more to the common\r\npeople and to robbers, than to the nobles; but he knew the law very well,\r\nand could not deny its validity. Meanwhile he covered his silvery beard\r\nwith his hand and smiled, because he was very much pleased. Finally he\r\nwent to the low portico, accompanied by Princess Anna Danuta, a few\r\npriests and the knights.\r\n\r\nZbyszko having perceived him, lifted Danusia again; the old castellan\r\nplaced his hand on her golden hair, and gravely and benevolently inclined\r\nhis hoary head. The assembled people understood this sign and shouted so\r\nthat the walls of the castle were shaken: \"May God preserve you! Long\r\nlife, just lord! Live and judge us!\"\r\n\r\nThen the people cheered Zbyszko and Danusia when a moment later, they\r\nboth went to the portico, fell at the feet of the good Princess Anna\r\nDanuta, who had saved Zbyszko's life, because she, together with the\r\nscholars, had found the remedy and had taught Danusia how to act.\r\n\r\n\"Long life to the young couple!\" shouted Powala of Taczew.\r\n\r\n\"Long life!\" repeated the others. The castellan, hoary with age, turned\r\ntoward the princess and said:\r\n\r\n\"Gracious princess, the betrothal must be performed immediately, because\r\nthe custom requires it!\"\r\n\r\n\"The betrothal will take place immediately,\" answered the good lady,\r\nwhose face was irradiated with joy; \"but for the wedding, they must have\r\nthe consent of Jurand of Spychow.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF PART FIRST.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART SECOND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nIn merchant Amylej's house, Macko and Zbyszko were deliberating what to\r\ndo. The old knight expected to die soon, and Father Cybek, a Franciscan\r\nfriar who had experience in treating wounds, predicted the same;\r\ntherefore he wanted to return to Bogdaniec to die and be buried beside\r\nhis forefathers in the cemetery in Ostrow.\r\n\r\nBut not all of his forefathers were buried there. In days of yore it had\r\nbeen a numerous family of _wlodykas_. During the war their cry was:\r\n\"Grady!\" On their shields, because they claimed to be better _wlodykas_\r\nthan the others who had no right to a coat of arms, they had emblazoned a\r\nTempa Podkowa. In 1331, in the battle of Plowce, seventy warriors from\r\nBogdaniec were killed in the marshes by German archers. Only one\r\nWojciech, called Tur, escaped. After this defeat by the Germans, the\r\nking, Wladyslaw Lokietek, granted him a coat of arms and the estate of\r\nBogdaniec as a special privilege. Wojciech returned home, only to\r\ndiscover the complete annihilation of his family.\r\n\r\nWhile the men of Bogdaniec were perishing from German arrows, the\r\n_Raubritters_ of Szlonsk fell upon their homes, burned their buildings,\r\nand slaughtered or took into slavery the peasants. Wojciech remained\r\nalone, the heir of a large but devastated tract of land, which formerly\r\nbelonged to the whole family of _wlodykas_. Five years afterward he\r\nmarried and he begot two sons, Jasko and Macko. Afterward he was killed\r\nin a forest by an urus.[58]\r\n\r\nThe sons grew up under the mother's care. Her maiden name was Kachna of\r\nSpalenica. She was so brave that she conducted two successful expeditions\r\nagainst the Germans of Szlonsk to avenge former wrongs; but in the third\r\nexpedition she was killed. Before that, however, she built with the help\r\nof the slaves, a _grodek_[59] in Bogdaniec; on account of that, Jasko and\r\nMacko, although from their former estates of _wlodykas_ were called\r\n_wlodykas_, now became men of importance. When Jasko became of age, he\r\nmarried Jagienka of Mocarzew, and begot Zbyszko; Macko remained\r\nunmarried. He took care of his nephew's property as far as his war\r\nexpeditions permitted.\r\n\r\nBut when during the civil war between Grzymalits and Nalenczs, Bogdaniec\r\nwas again burned and the peasants scattered, Macko could not restore it,\r\nalthough he toiled for several years. Finally he pledged the land to his\r\nrelative, the abbot, and with Zbyszko who was small, he went to Lithuania\r\nto fight against the Germans.\r\n\r\nBut he had never forgotten about Bogdaniec. He went to Litwa hoping to\r\nbecome rich from booty so as to return to Bogdaniec, redeem the land from\r\nhis pledge, colonize it with slaves, rebuild the _grodek_ and settle\r\nZbyszko on it. Therefore now, after Zbyszko's lucky deliverance, they\r\nwere discussing this matter at the house of the merchant, Amylej.\r\n\r\nThey had money enough to redeem the land they possessed quite a fortune\r\ngathered from the booty, from the ransoms paid by the knights captured by\r\nthem, and from Witold's presents. They had received great benefit from\r\nthat fight with the two Fryzjan knights. The suits of armor alone, were\r\nworth what was considered in those times quite a fortune; beside the\r\narmor, they had captured wagons, people, clothes, money and rich\r\nimplements of war. The merchant Amylej had just purchased many of these\r\nthings, and among them two pieces of beautiful Flemish broadcloth. Macko\r\nsold the splendid armor, because he thought that he would have no use for\r\nit. The merchant sold it the next day to Marcin of Wrocimowice, whose\r\ncoat of arms was Polkoza. He sold it for a large sum, because in those\r\ntimes the suits of armor made in Milan were considered the best in the\r\nworld and were expensive. Zbyszko regretted very much that they sold it.\r\n\r\n\"If God give you back your health,\" said he, to his uncle, \"where will\r\nyou find another like it?\"\r\n\r\n\"There, where I found this one; on some German,\" answered Macko. \"But I\r\nshall not escape death. The head of the spear will not come out from my\r\nbody. When I tried to pull it out with my hands, I pushed it in further.\r\nAnd now there is no help.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must drink two or three pots of bear's grease.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah! Father Cybek also said that would be a good thing. But where can I\r\nget it here? In Bogdaniec one could very easily kill a bear!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we must go to Bogdaniec! Only you must not die on the road.\"\r\n\r\nOld Macko looked at his nephew with tenderness.\r\n\r\n\"I know where you would like to go; to the Prince Janusz's court, or to\r\nJurand of Spychow, and fight the Germans of Chelminsko.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will not deny it. I would be glad to go to Warszawa with the princess'\r\ncourt, or to go to Ciechanow; and I would remain as long as possible with\r\nDanusia, because now she is not only my lady, but my love also. I tremble\r\nwhen I think of her! I shall follow her even to the end of the world; but\r\nnow you are first. You did not desert me, therefore I will never abandon\r\nyou. We must go to Bogdaniec.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are a good man,\" said Macko.\r\n\r\n\"God would punish me, if I were not mindful of you. Look, they are\r\ngetting ready! I ordered one wagon to be filled with hay. Amylejowna has\r\nmade us a present of a feather bed, but I am afraid it will be too warm\r\nfor you. We will travel slowly, in company with the princess' court, so\r\nthat you may have good care. When they turn toward Mazowsze, we will turn\r\ntoward home; may God help us!\"\r\n\r\n\"If I can only live long enough to rebuild the _grodek_!\" exclaimed\r\nMacko. \"I know that after my death, you will not think anything more\r\nabout Bogdaniec.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why will I not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because your head will be filled with thoughts of battles and of love.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you not think yourself about war? I have planned what I must do; in\r\nthe first place, I will rebuild the _grodek_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean to do that?\" asked Macko, \"Well, and when the _grodek_ is\r\nfinished?\"\r\n\r\n\"When the _grodek_ is rebuilt, then I will go to Warszawa to the prince's\r\ncourt, or to Ciechanow.\"\r\n\r\n\"After my death?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you die soon, then after your death; but before I go, I will bury you\r\nproperly; if the Lord Jesus restore your health, then you will remain in\r\nBogdaniec. The princess promised me that I should receive my knightly\r\ngirdle from the prince. Otherwise Lichtenstein will not fight with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then afterward you will go to Marienburg?\"\r\n\r\n\"To Marienburg, or even to the end of the world to reach Lichtenstein.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not blame you for it! Either he or you must die!\"\r\n\r\n\"I will bring his girdle and his gloves to Bogdaniec; do not be\r\nfrightened!\"\r\n\r\n\"You must look out for treachery. There is plenty among them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will bow to Prince Janusz and ask him to send to the grand master for\r\na safe conduct. There is peace now. I will go to Marienburg, where there\r\nare always many knights. Then you know? In the first place, Lichtenstein;\r\nthen I will look for those who wear peacock's tufts, and I will challenge\r\nthem in turn. If the Lord Jesus grant me victory, then I will fulfill my\r\nvow.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking thus, Zbyszko smiled at his own thoughts; his face was like that\r\nof a lad who tells what knightly deeds he will perform when he is a man.\r\n\r\n\"Hej!\" said Macko; \"if you defeat three knights belonging to great\r\nfamilies, then you will not only fulfill your vow, but you will bring\r\nsome booty!\"\r\n\r\n\"Three!\" exclaimed Zbyszko. \"In the prison I promised myself, that I\r\nwould not be selfish with Danusia. As many knights as I have fingers on\r\nboth hands!\"\r\n\r\nMacko shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"Are you surprised?\" said Zbyszko. \"From Marienburg I shall go to Jurand\r\nof Spychow. Why should I not bow to him, he is Danusia's father? With him\r\nI shall attack the Germans of Chelminsko. You told me yourself that in\r\nthe whole of Mazowsze there was no greater ware-wolf against the\r\nGermans.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if he will not give you Danusia?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not? He is seeking his vengeance. I am searching for mine. Can he\r\nfind a better man? And then, the princess has given her consent for the\r\nbetrothal; he will not refuse.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see one thing,\" said Macko, \"you will take all the people from\r\nBogdaniec in order to have a retinue, as is proper for a knight, and the\r\nland will remain without hands to till it. As long as I live, I will not\r\nlet you do it; but after my death, I see, you will take them.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Lord God will help me to get a retinue; Janko of Tulcza is a\r\nrelation of ours and he will help me also.\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment the door opened, and as though to prove that the Lord God\r\nwould help Zbyszko get a retinue, two men entered. They were\r\ndark-complexioned, short, dressed in Jewish-like yellow caftans, red caps\r\nand very wide trousers. They stopped in the doorway and touched their\r\nfingers to their foreheads, to their mouths, and then to their chests;\r\nthen they bowed to the ground.\r\n\r\n\"Who are these devils?\" asked Macko. \"Who are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your slaves,\" answered the newcomers in broken Polish.\r\n\r\n\"For what reason? Where from? Who sent you here?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Pan_ Zawisza sent us here as a present to the young knight, to be his\r\nslaves.\"\r\n\r\n\"O for God's sake! two men more!\" exclaimed Macko, joyfully.\r\n\r\n\"Of what nationality are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"We are Turks!\"\r\n\r\n\"Turks?\" repeated Zbyszko. \"I shall have two Turks in my retinue. Have\r\nyou ever seen Turks?\"\r\n\r\nAnd having jumped toward them, he began to turn them around and to look\r\nat them curiously. Macko said:\r\n\r\n\"I have never seen them; but I have heard, that the _Pan_ of Garbow has\r\nTurks in his service whom he captured while fighting on the Danube with\r\nthe Roman emperor, Zygmunt. How is it? Are you heathens, your\r\ndog-brothers?\"\r\n\r\n\"The lord ordered us to be baptized,\" said one of the slaves.\r\n\r\n\"Did you have no money for ransom?\"\r\n\r\n\"We are from far lands, from Asiatic shores, from Brussa.\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko, who always listened gladly to war stories, and especially when\r\nthere was anything told about the deeds of the famous Zawisza of Garbow,\r\nbegan to inquire how they were captured. But there was nothing\r\nextraordinary in their narration; Zawisza attacked them in a ravine, part\r\nof them perished and part were captured; and he sent the prisoners as\r\npresents to his different friends. Zbyszko and Macko's hearts were\r\nthrobing at the sight of such a noble gift, especially as it was\r\ndifficult to get men in those days and the possession of them constituted\r\ntrue wealth.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, Zawisza himself accompanied by Powala and Paszko\r\nZlodzie; of Biskupice arrived. As they had all worked hard to free\r\nZbyszko, they were pleased when they succeeded; therefore everyone of\r\nthem gave him some present as a souvenir. The liberal _Pan_ of Taczew\r\ngave him a beautiful large caparison embroidered with gold; Paszko, a\r\nHungarian sword and ten _grzywiens_.[60] Then came Lis of Targowisko,\r\nFarurej and Krzon of Kozieglowy, with Marcin of Wrocimowice and finally\r\nZyndram of Maszkow; everyone brought rich presents.\r\n\r\nZbyszko welcomed them with a joyful heart, feeling very happy on account\r\nof the presents and because the most famous knights in the kingdom were\r\nshowing him their friendship. They asked him about his departure and\r\nMacko's health, recommending to the latter, different remedies which\r\nwould miraculously heal wounds.\r\n\r\nBut Macko recommended Zbyszko to their care, being ready himself for the\r\nother world. He said that it was impossible to live with an iron spear\r\nhead between the ribs. He complained also that he spit blood and could\r\nnot eat. A quart of shelled nuts, a sausage two spans long and a dish of\r\nboiled eggs were all he could eat at once. Father Cybek had bled him\r\nseveral times, hoping in that way to draw out the fever from around his\r\nheart, and restore his appetite; but it had not helped him any.\r\n\r\nBut he was so pleased with the presents given to his nephew, that at that\r\nmoment he was feeling better, and when the merchant, Amylej, ordered a\r\nbarrel of wine brought in honor of such famous guests, Macko drank with\r\nthem. They began to talk about Zbyszko's deliverance and about his\r\nbetrothal with Danusia. The knights did not doubt that Jurand of Spychow\r\nwould give his consent, especially if Zbyszko avenged the death of\r\nDanusia's mother and captured the peacock tufts.\r\n\r\n\"But as for Lichtenstein,\" said Zawisza, \"I do not think he will accept\r\nyour challenge, because he is a friar, and also one of the officers in\r\nthe Order. Bah! The people of his retinue told me that perhaps he would\r\nbe elected grand master!\"\r\n\r\n\"If he refuse to fight, he will lose his honor,\" said Lis of Targowisko.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered Zawisza, \"because he is not a lay knight; and a friar is\r\nnot permitted to fight in single combat.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it often happens that they do fight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Because the Order has become corrupt. The knights make different vows;\r\nbut they often break them, thus setting a bad example to the whole\r\nChristian world. But a Krzyzak, especially a _comthur_, is not obliged to\r\naccept a challenge.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha! Then only in war can you reach him.\"\r\n\r\n\"But they say, that there will be no war,\" said Zbyszko, \"because the\r\nKnights of the Cross are afraid of our nation.\"\r\n\r\nTo this Zyndram of Maszkow said:\r\n\r\n\"This peace will not last long. There cannot be a good understanding with\r\nthe wolf, because he must live on the goods of others.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the meantime, perhaps we will be obliged to fight with Tymur the\r\nLame,\" said Powala. \"Prince Witold was defeated by Edyga; that is\r\ncertain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certain. _Wojewoda_ Spytko will not return,\" said Paszko Zlodziej of\r\nBiskupice.\r\n\r\n\"The late queen prophesied it would be so,\" said the _Pan_ of Taczew.\r\n\r\n\"Ha! Then perhaps we will be obliged to go against Tymur.\"\r\n\r\nHere the conversation was tunned to the Lithuanian expedition against the\r\nTartars. There was no doubt that Prince Witold, that able commander being\r\nrather impetuous, had been badly defeated at Worskla, where a great\r\nnumber of the Lithuanian _bojars_ and also a few Polish knights were\r\nkilled. The knights now gathered in Amylej's house, pitied especially\r\nSpytek of Melsztyn, the greatest lord in the kingdom, who went with the\r\nexpedition as a volunteer; and after the battle he was lost--nobody knew\r\nwhere. They praised his chivalrous deed, and told how he, having received\r\nfrom the commander of the enemy a protective _kolpak_,[61] would not wear\r\nit during the battle, preferring honorable death to life granted him by\r\nthe ruler of a heathen nation. But it was not certain yet, whether he had\r\nperished, or was in captivity. If he were a prisoner, he could pay his\r\nransom himself, because his riches were enormous, and he also held in\r\nfief the whole Podole from King Wladyslaw.\r\n\r\nBut the defeat of Witold's army might prove ruinous to the whole of\r\nJagiello's empire. Nobody knew when the Tartars, encouraged by the\r\nvictory over Witold, might now invade the lands and cities belonging to\r\nthe grand dukedom. In that case the kingdom of Poland would be involved\r\nin a war. Therefore many knights, who like Zawisza, Farurej, Dobko and\r\neven Powala, were accustomed to seek adventures and fights in foreign\r\ncountries, remained in Krakow not knowing what might soon happen. In case\r\nTamerlan, who was the ruler of twenty-seven states, moved the whole\r\nMongolian world, then the peril to the kingdom would be great.\r\n\r\n\"If it be necessary, then we will measure our swords with the Lame. With\r\nus it will not be such an easy matter as it was with those other nations,\r\nwhich he conquered and exterminated. Then the other Christian princes\r\nwill help us.\"\r\n\r\nTo this Zyndram of Maszkow, who especially hated the Order, said\r\nbitterly:\r\n\r\n\"I do not know about the princes; but the Knights of the Cross are ready\r\nto become friends even with the Tartars and attack us from the other\r\nside.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we shall have a war!\" exclaimed Zbyszko. \"I am against the\r\nKrzyzaks!\"\r\n\r\nBut the other knights began to contradict Zyndram. \"The Knights of the\r\nCross have no fear of God, and they seek only their own advantage; but\r\nthey will not help the pagans against Christian people. And then Tymur is\r\nat war somewhere in Asia, and the commander of the Tartars, Edyga, lost\r\nso heavily in the battle, that he is afraid even of victory. Prince\r\nWitold is a man full of expedients, and you may be sure he took\r\nprecautions; and even if this time the Lithuanians were not successful,\r\nat any rate it is not a new thing for them to overcome the Tartars.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have to fight for life and death; not with the Tartars but with the\r\nGermans,\" said Zyndram of Maszkow, \"and if we do not crush them, our\r\nperil will come from them.\"\r\n\r\nThen he turned toward Zbyszko:\r\n\r\n\"And in the first place Mazowsze will perish. You will always find plenty\r\nto do there; be not afraid!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hej! if my uncle were well, I would go there immediately.\"\r\n\r\n\"God help you!\" said Powala, raising a glass.\r\n\r\n\"Yours and Danusia's health!\"\r\n\r\n\"To the destruction of the Germans!\" added Zyndram of Maszkow.\r\n\r\nThen they began to say farewell. At that moment one of the princess'\r\ncourtiers entered with a falcon on his arm; and having bowed to the\r\nknights who were present, he turned with a peculiar smile to Zbyszko:\r\n\r\n\"The lady princess wished me to tell you,\" said he, \"that she will stay\r\nin Krakow over night, and will start on the journey to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is well,\" said Zbyszko; \"but why? Is anybody sick?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. But the princess has a visitor from Mazowsze.\"\r\n\r\n\"The prince himself?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not the prince, but Jurand of Spychow,\" answered the courtier.\r\n\r\nHaving heard this, Zbyszko became very much confused, and his heart began\r\nto throb as it did when they read the sentence of death to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nPrincess Anna was not much surprised at the arrival of Jurand of Spychow.\r\nIt used to happen, that during the continual attacks and fights with\r\nneighboring German knights, a sudden longing for Danusia seized him. Then\r\nhe would appear unexpectedly in Warszawa, in Ciechanow, or wherever\r\nPrince Janusz's court was situated for the time being.\r\n\r\nEvery time he saw the child, his grief burst forth anew because Danusia\r\nlooked like her mother. The people thought that his iron heart filled\r\nwith feelings of vengeance, would become softer through such grief. The\r\nprincess often tried to persuade him to abandon his bloody Spychow, and\r\nremain at the court near Danusia. The prince himself, appreciating his\r\nbravery and importance, and at the same time wishing to spare him the\r\nfatigue inevitable in the quarrels on the frontier, offered him the\r\noffice of sword bearer. It was always in vain. The sight of Danusia\r\nopened the old wounds in his heart. After a few days he always lost his\r\nappetite, could not sleep, and became silent. Evidently his heart began\r\nto bleed, and finally he would disappear from the court and returned to\r\nthe marshes of Spychow, in order to drown in blood his grief and anger.\r\nThen the people used to say: \"Woe to the Germans! It is true they are not\r\nsheep; but they are sheep to Jurand, because he is a wolf to them.\" In\r\nfact, after a time, the news would spread about the volunteers who, going\r\nto join the Knights of the Cross, were captured on their journey; about\r\nburned towns, and captured peasants; or about deadly fights from which\r\nthe terrible Jurand always emerged victorious. On account of the\r\nrapacious disposition of the Mazurs and of the German knights who were\r\nholding the land and the strongholds from the Order, even during the\r\ngreatest peace between the prince of Mazowsze and the Order, continual\r\nfighting was going on near the frontier. Even when cutting wood in the\r\nforests or harvesting in the fields, the inhabitants used to carry their\r\narms. The people living there felt no certainty for the morrow; were in\r\ncontinual readiness for war, and were hard-hearted. Nobody was satisfied\r\nwith defence only; but for pillage repaid with pillage; for\r\nconflagration, with conflagration; for invasion, with invasion. It often\r\nhappened that while the Germans were stealing through the forest, to\r\nattack some stronghold and to seize the peasants or the cattle, at the\r\nsame time, the Mazurs were doing the same. Sometimes they met, then they\r\nfought; but often only the leaders challenged each other for a deadly\r\nfight, after which the conqueror took the retinue of his defeated\r\nadversary. Therefore, when complaints were received at the Warsavian\r\ncourt about Jurand, the prince used to reply with complaints about the\r\nattacks made by the Germans. Thus both sides asked for justice, but\r\nneither was willing to grant it; all robberies, conflagrations and\r\ninvasions went unpunished.\r\n\r\nBut Jurand dwelling in Spychow, surrounded by marshes overgrown with\r\nrushes, and being filled with an unquenchable desire for vengeance, was\r\nso dreaded by his German neighbors, that finally their fear became\r\ngreater than their courage. The lands bordering upon Spychow, were lying\r\nfallow; the forests were overgrown with wild hops and the meadows with\r\nreeds. Several German knights tried to settle in the neighborhood of\r\nSpychow; but everyone of them after a time, preferred to abandon his\r\nestate held in fief, his herds and his peasants, rather than live near\r\nthis implacable man. Very often the knights planned a common expedition\r\nagainst Spychow; but everyone ended in defeat. They tried different\r\nmeans. One time they brought from the province of Mein, a knight noted\r\nfor his strength and cruelty, and who had always been victorious in all\r\nfights. He challenged Jurand. But as soon as they entered the lists, the\r\nGerman was so frightened at the sight of the dreadful Mazur, that he\r\nwheeled his horse intending to flee; Jurand pierced his defenceless back\r\nwith a spear, and in that way dishonored him forever. After that still\r\ngreater fear filled the neighbors, and if a German perceived even from\r\nafar Spychowian smoke, he immediately crossed himself and began to pray\r\nto his patron in heaven. It was generally believed that Jurand had sold\r\nhis soul to the evil one for the sake of vengeance.\r\n\r\nThe people told dreadful tales about Spychow: they said that the path\r\nleading to it through the quaggy marshes which were overgrown with duck\r\nweed and had bottomless depths, was so narrow that two men on horseback\r\ncould not ride abreast; that on each side there were many Germans' bones,\r\nand that during the night, the heads of drowned men were seen walking on\r\nspiders' legs, howling and drawing travelers on horses into the depths.\r\nThey also said that the gate in the _grodek_ was ornamented with\r\nskeletons. These stories were not true. But in the barred pits dug under\r\nthe house in Spychow, there were always many groaning prisoners; and\r\nJurand's name was more dreadful than those tales about the skeletons and\r\ndrowned people.\r\n\r\nZbyszko having learned of Jurand's arrival, hastened to him, but with a\r\ncertain uneasiness in his heart because he was Danusia's father. Nobody\r\ncould forbid him choose Danusia for the lady of his thoughts; but\r\nafterward the princess had betrothed them. What will Jurand say to that?\r\nWill he consent? What will happen if he refuse his consent? These\r\nquestions filled his heart with fear, because he now cared for Danusia\r\nmore than for anything else in the world. He was only encouraged by the\r\nthought that perhaps Jurand would praise him for having attacked\r\nLichtenstein, because he had done it to avenge Danusia's mother; and in\r\nconsequence had nearly lost his own head.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime he began to question the courtier, who had come to\r\nAmylej's for him:\r\n\r\n\"Where are you conducting me?\" asked he; \"to the castle?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, to the castle. Jurand is with the princess' court.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me, what kind of a man he is, so that I may know how to talk with\r\nhim!\"\r\n\r\n\"What can I tell you! He is a man entirely different from other men. They\r\nsay that he was mirthful before his blood became seared in his heart!\"\r\n\r\n\"Is he clever?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is cunning; he robs others but he does not let others rob him. Hej!\r\nHe has only one eye, because the other was destroyed by the thrust of a\r\nGerman crossbow; but with that one, he can look a man through and\r\nthrough. He loves no one except the princess, our lady; and he loves her\r\nbecause his wife was a lady from her court, and now his daughter is with\r\nher.\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko breathed.\r\n\r\n\"Then you think that he will not oppose the princess' will?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know what you would like to learn, and therefore I will tell you what\r\nI heard. The princess spoke to him about your betrothment, because it\r\nwould not be proper to conceal it from him; but it is not known what he\r\nsaid in reply.\"\r\n\r\nWhile thus speaking, they arrived at the gate. The captain of the\r\narchers, the same who had conducted Zbyszko to the scaffold, now saluted\r\nthem. After having passed the guards, they entered the court-yard and\r\nturned to the left toward the part of the castle occupied by the\r\nprincess.\r\n\r\nThe courtier meeting a servant in the doorway, asked:\r\n\r\n\"Where is Jurand of Spychow?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the '_krzywy_[62] room' with his daughter.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is there,\" said the courtier, pointing at the door.\r\n\r\nZbyszko crossed himself, raised the curtain in the doorway, and entered\r\nwith throbbing heart. But he did not perceive Jurand and Danusia at once,\r\nbecause the room was not only \"crooked\" but dark also. But after a while\r\nhe saw the fair head of the girl, who was sitting on her father's lap.\r\nThey did not hear him when he entered; therefore e stopped near the door,\r\nand finally he said:\r\n\r\n\"May He be blessed!\"\r\n\r\n\"For ages and ages,\" answered Jurand, rising.\r\n\r\nAt that moment Danusia sprang toward the young knight and having seized\r\nhim with both hands, began to scream:\r\n\r\n\"Zbyszku! _Tatus_[63] is here!\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko kissed her hands; then he approached Jurand, and said:\r\n\r\n\"I came to bow to you; you know who I am.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he bent slightly, making a movement with his hands as if he wished to\r\nseize Jurand by his knees. But Jurand grasped his hand, turned him toward\r\nthe light and began to look at him.\r\n\r\nZbyszko had already regained his self-possession; therefore he looked\r\nwith curiosity at Jurand. He beheld before him a gigantic man with fallow\r\nhair and moustache, with a face pitted with smallpox and one eye of\r\niron-like color. It seemed to him as if this eye would pierce him, and he\r\nagain became confused. Finally, not knowing what to say, but wishing to\r\nsay something to break the embarrassing silence, he asked:\r\n\r\n\"Then you are Jurand of Spychow, Danusia's father?\"\r\n\r\nBut the other only pointed to an oaken bench, standing beside the chair\r\non which he sat himself and continued to look at Zbyszko, who finally\r\nbecame impatient, and said:\r\n\r\n\"It is not pleasant for me to sit as though I were in a court.\"\r\n\r\nThen Jurand said:\r\n\r\n\"You wanted to fight with Lichtenstein?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes!\" answered Zbyszko.\r\n\r\nIn the eye of the Lord of Spychow shone a strange light and his stern\r\nface began to brighten. After awhile he looked at Danusia and asked;\r\n\r\n\"And was it for her?\"\r\n\r\n\"For no other! My uncle told you that I made a vow to her to tear the\r\npeacock tufts from German heads. But now there shall be not only three of\r\nthem, but at least as many as I have fingers on both hands. In that way I\r\nwill help you to avenge the death of Danusia's mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Woe to them!\" answered Jurand.\r\n\r\nThen there was silence again. But Zbyszko, having noticed that by showing\r\nhis hatred of the Germans, he would capture Jurand's heart, said:\r\n\r\n\"I will not forgive them! They nearly caused my death.\"\r\n\r\nHere he turned to Danusia and added:\r\n\r\n\"She saved me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" said Jurand.\r\n\r\n\"Are you angry?\"\r\n\r\n\"Since you made a vow to her, you must serve her, because such is the\r\nknightly custom.\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko hesitated; but after awhile, he began to say with evident\r\nuneasiness:\r\n\r\n\"Do you know that she covered my head with her veil? All the knights and\r\nalso the Franciscan who was with me holding the cross, heard her say: 'He\r\nis mine!' Therefore I will be loyal to her until death, so help me God!\"\r\n\r\nHaving said this, he kneeled, and wishing to show that he was familiar\r\nwith the customs of chivalry, he kissed both of Danusia's shoes with\r\ngreat reverence. Then he arose and having turned to Jurand, asked him:\r\n\r\n\"Have you ever seen another as fair as she?\"\r\n\r\nJurand suddenly put his hands behind his head, and having closed his\r\neyes, he said loudly:\r\n\r\n\"I have seen one other; but the Germans killed her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then listen,\" said Zbyszko, enthusiastically; \"we have the same wrong\r\nand the same vengeance. Those dog-brothers also killed my people from\r\nBogdaniec. You cannot find a better man for your work. It is no new thing\r\nfor me! Ask my uncle. I can fight either with spear or axe, short sword\r\nor long sword! Did my uncle tell you about those Fryzjans? I will\r\nslaughter the Germans for you like sheep; and as for the girl, I vow to\r\nyou on my knees that I will fight for her even with the _starosta_ of\r\nhell himself, and that I will give her up neither for lands nor for\r\nherds, nor for any other thing! Even if some one offered me a castle with\r\nglass windows in it but without her, I would refuse the castle and follow\r\nher to the end of the world.\"\r\n\r\nJurand sat for awhile with his head between his hands; but finally he\r\nawakened as from a dream, and said with sadness and grief:\r\n\r\n\"I like you, young man, but I cannot give her to you; she is not destined\r\nfor you, my poor boy.\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko hearing this, grew dumb and began to look at Jurand with\r\nwondering eyes.\r\n\r\nBut Danusia came to his help. Zbyszko was dear to her, and she was\r\npleased to be considered not \"a bush\" but \"a grown-up girl.\" She also\r\nliked the betrothal and the dainties which the knight used to bring her\r\nevery day; therefore when she understood that she was likely to lose all\r\nthis, she slipped down from the arm chair and having put her head on her\r\nfather's lap, she began to cry:\r\n\r\n\"_Tatulu, Tatulu!_\"[64] He evidently loved her better than anything else,\r\nfor he put his hand softly on her head, while from his face disappeared\r\nall trace of deadly grudge and anger; only sadness remained.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Zbyszko recovered his composure, and now said:\r\n\r\n\"How is it? Do you wish to oppose God's will?\"\r\n\r\nTo this Jurand replied:\r\n\r\n\"If it be God's will, then you will get her; but I cannot give you my\r\nconsent. Bah! I would be glad to do it, but I cannot.\"\r\n\r\nHaving said this, he arose, took Danusia in his arms, and went toward the\r\ndoor. When Zbyszko tried to detain him, he stopped for a moment and said:\r\n\r\n\"I will not be angry with you if you render her knightly services; but do\r\nnot ask me any questions, because I cannot tell you anything.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he went out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nThe next day Jurand did not avoid Zbyszko at all; and he did not prevent\r\nhim from performing for Danusia, during the journey, those different\r\nservices which, being her knight, he was obliged to render her. On the\r\ncontrary, Zbyszko noticed that the gloomy _Pan_ of Spychow looked at him\r\nkindly, as if he were regretting that he had been obliged to refuse his\r\nrequest. The young _wlodyka_ tried several times to have some\r\nconversation with him. After they started from Krakow, there were plenty\r\nof opportunities during the journey, because both accompanied the\r\nprincess on horseback; but as soon as Zbyszko endeavored to learn\r\nsomething about the secret difficulties separating him from Danusia, the\r\nconversation was suddenly ended.\r\n\r\nJurand's face became gloomy, and he looked at Zbyszko uneasily as if he\r\nwere afraid he would betray himself.\r\n\r\nZbyszko thought that perhaps the princess knew what the obstacle was; so\r\nhaving an opportunity to speak to her privately, he inquired; but she\r\ncould not tell him anything.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly there is some secret,\" she said. \"Jurand himself told me that;\r\nbut he begged me not to question him further, because he not only did not\r\nwish to tell what it was, but he could not. Surely he must be bound by\r\nsome oath, as so often happens among the knights. But God will help us\r\nand everything will turn out well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Without Danusia I will be as unhappy as a chained dog or a bear in a\r\nditch,\" answered Zbyszko. \"There will be neither joy nor pleasure,\r\nnothing but sorrow and sighing; I will go against the Tartars with Prince\r\nWitold and may they kill me there. But first I must accompany uncle to\r\nBogdaniec, and then tear from German heads the peacock's tufts as I\r\npromised. Perhaps the Germans will kill me; and I prefer such a death\r\nrather than to live and see some one else take Danusia.\"\r\n\r\nThe princess looked at him with her kind blue eyes, and asked him, with a\r\ncertain degree of astonishment:\r\n\r\n\"Then you would permit it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I? As long I have breath in my nostrils, it will not happen, unless my\r\nhand be paralyzed, and I be unable to hold my axe!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you see!\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah! But how can I take her against her father's will?\"\r\n\r\nTo this the princess said, as to herself:\r\n\r\n\"Does it not happen that way sometimes?\"\r\n\r\nThen to Zbyszko:\r\n\r\n\"God's will is stronger than a father's will. What did Jurand say to you?\r\nHe said to me 'If it be God's will, then he will get her.'\"\r\n\r\n\"He said the same to me!\" exclaimed Zbyszko.\r\n\r\n\"Do you not see?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is my only consolation, gracious lady.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will help you, and you can be sure of Danusia's constancy. Only\r\nyesterday I said to her: 'Danusia, will you always love Zbyszko?' And she\r\nanswered: 'I will be Zbyszko's and no one else's.' She is still a green\r\nberry, but when she promises anything, she keeps her word, because she is\r\nthe daughter of a knight. Her mother was like her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank God!\" said Zbyszko.\r\n\r\n\"Only remember to be faithful to her also; man is inconstant; he promises\r\nto love one faithfully, and afterward he promises another.\"\r\n\r\n\"May Lord Jesus punish me if I prove such!\" exclaimed Zbyszko\r\nenergetically.\r\n\r\n\"Well, remember then. And after you have conveyed your uncle to\r\nBogdaniec, come to our court; there will be some opportunity then for you\r\nto win your spurs; then we will see what can be done. In the meanwhile\r\nDanusia will mature, and she will feel God's will; although she loves you\r\nvery much even now, it is not the same love a woman feels. Perhaps Jurand\r\nwill give his consent, because I see he likes you. You can go to Spychow\r\nand from there can go with Jurand against the Germans; it may happen that\r\nyou will render him some great service and thus gain his affection.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gracious princess, I have thought the same; but with your sanction it\r\nwill be easier.\"\r\n\r\nThis conversation cheered Zbyszko. Meanwhile at the first baiting place,\r\nold Macko became worse, and it was necessary to remain until he became\r\nbetter. The good princess, Anna Danuta, left him all the medicine she had\r\nwith her; but she was obliged to continue her journey; therefore both\r\n_wlodykas_ of Bogdaniec bid those belonging to the Mazovian court\r\nfarewell. Zbyszko prostrated himself at the princess' feet, then at\r\nDanusia's; he promised her once more to be faithful and to meet her soon\r\nat Ciechanow or at Warszawa; finally he seized her in his strong arms,\r\nand having lifted her, he repeated with a voice full of emotion:\r\n\r\n\"Remember me, my sweetest flower! Remember me, my little golden fish!\"\r\n\r\nDanusia embraced him as though he were a beloved brother, put her little\r\ncheek to his face and wept copiously.\r\n\r\n\"I do not want to go to Ciechanow without Zbyszko; I do not want to go to\r\nCiechanow!\"\r\n\r\nJurand saw her grief, but he was not angry. On the contrary, he bid the\r\nyoung man good-bye kindly; and after he had mounted, he turned toward him\r\nonce more, and said:\r\n\r\n\"God be with you; do not bear ill will toward me.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can I feel ill will toward you; you are Danusia's father!\" answered\r\nZbyszko cordially; then he bent to his stirrup, and the old man shook\r\nhands with him, and said:\r\n\r\n\"May God help you in everything! Understand?\"\r\n\r\nThen he rode away. But Zbyszko understood that in his last words, he\r\nwished him success; and when he went back to the wagon on which Macko was\r\nlying, he said:\r\n\r\n\"Do you know I believe he is willing; but something hinders him from\r\ngiving his consent. You were in Spychow and you have good common sense,\r\ntry to guess what it is.\"\r\n\r\nBut Macko was too ill. The fever increased so much toward evening, that\r\nhe became delirious. Therefore instead of answering Zbyszko, he looked at\r\nhim as if he were astonished; then he asked:\r\n\r\n\"Why do they ring the bells?\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko was frightened. He feared that if the sick man heard the sound of\r\nbells, it was a sign that death would soon come. He feared also that the\r\nold man might die without a priest and without confession, and therefore\r\ngo, if not to hell, then at least for long centuries to purgatory;\r\ntherefore he determined to resume their journey, in order to reach, as\r\nsoon as possible, some parish in which Macko could receive the last\r\nsacraments.\r\n\r\nConsequently they started and traveled during the night. Zbyszko sat in\r\nthe wagon on the hay, beside the sick man and watched him till day-break.\r\nFrom time to time he gave him wine to drink. Macko drank it eagerly,\r\nbecause it relieved him greatly. After the second quart he recovered from\r\nhis delirium; and after the third, he fell asleep; he slept so well that\r\nZbyszko bent toward him from time to time, to ascertain if he was still\r\nalive.\r\n\r\nUntil the time of his imprisonment in Krakow, he did not realize how\r\ndearly he loved this uncle who replaced, for him, father and mother. But\r\nnow he realized it very well; and he felt that after his uncle's death,\r\nlife would be very lonesome for him, alone, without relatives, except the\r\nabbot who held Bogdaniec in pledge, without friends and without anyone to\r\nhelp him. The thought came to him that if Macko died, it would be one\r\nmore reason for vengeance on the Germans, by whose means he had nearly\r\nlost his head, by whom all his forefathers had been killed, also\r\nDanusia's mother and many other innocent people, whom he knew or about\r\nwhom he had heard from his acquaintances--and he began to say to himself:\r\n\r\n\"In this whole kingdom, there is no man who has not suffered some wrong\r\nfrom them, and who would not like to avenge those wrongs.\" Here he\r\nremembered the Germans with whom he fought at Wilno, and he knew that\r\neven the Tartars were less cruel.\r\n\r\nThe coming dawn interrupted his thoughts. The day was bright but cold.\r\nEvidently Macko felt better, because he was breathing more regularly and\r\nmore quietly. He did not awaken until the sun was quite warm; then he\r\nopened his eyes and said:\r\n\r\n\"I am better. Where are we?\"\r\n\r\n\"We are approaching Olkusk. You know, where they dig silver.\"\r\n\r\n\"If one could get that which is in the earth, then one could rebuild\r\nBogdaniec!\"\r\n\r\n\"I see you are better,\" answered Zbyszko laughing. \"Hej! it would be\r\nenough even for a stone castle! We will go to the _fara_,[65] because\r\nthere the priests will offer us hospitality and you will be able to make\r\nyour confession. Everything is in God's hands; but it is better to have\r\none's conscience clear.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am a sinner and will willingly repent,\" answered Macko. \"I dreamed\r\nlast night that the devils were taking my skin off. They were talking\r\nGerman. Thanks be to God that I am better. Have you slept any?\"\r\n\r\n\"How could I sleep, when I was watching you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then lie down for a while. When we arrive, I will awaken you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot sleep!\"\r\n\r\n\"What prevents you?\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko looked at his uncle and said:\r\n\r\n\"What else can it be, if not love? I have pain in my heart; but I will\r\nride on horseback for a while, that will help me.\"\r\n\r\nHe got down from the wagon, and mounted the horse, which his servant\r\nbrought for him; meanwhile, Macko touched his sore side; but he was\r\nevidently thinking about something else and not about his illness,\r\nbecause he tossed his head, smacked his lips and finally said:\r\n\r\n\"I wonder and wonder, and I cannot wonder enough, why you are so eager\r\nfor love, because your father was not that way, and neither am I.\"\r\n\r\nBut Zbyszko, instead of answering, stretched himself on the saddle, put\r\nhis hands on his hips, gave his head a toss and sang:\r\n\r\n  \"I cried the whole night, cried in the morning,\r\n  Where have you been, my sweet girl, my darling!\r\n  It will not help me, if I mourn for thee,\r\n  Because I am quite sure, you will not see me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hej!\"\r\n\r\nThis \"hej\" resounded in the forest, reverberated against the trunks of\r\nthe trees, finally reëchoed in the far distance and then was lost in the\r\nthickets.\r\n\r\nAgain Macko felt his side, in which the German spearhead had lodged and\r\nsaid, moaning a little:\r\n\r\n\"Formerly the people were wiser!\"\r\n\r\nThen he became thoughtful, as if recollecting the old times; and he\r\nadded:\r\n\r\n\"Although even then some of them were stupid also.\"\r\n\r\nBut, in the meantime, they emerged from the forest, behind which they\r\nperceived the miners' sheds, and further walls, built by King Kazimierz,\r\nand the tower of the _fara_ erected by Wladyslaw Lokietek.\r\n\r\nThe canon of the _fara_ beard Macko's confession and offered them\r\nhospitality; they remained there over night, and started the next\r\nmorning. Beyond Olkusk, they turned toward Szlonsk,[66] and on its\r\nboundaries, they proposed to ride toward Wielkopolska. The road was laid\r\nout through a large forest, in which there was heard toward sunset, the\r\nroaring of the urus and of the bison, and during the night the eyes of\r\nwolves were seen shining behind the thick hazelnut trees. But the\r\ngreatest danger which threatened the traveler on this road, was from the\r\nGerman and Germanized knights of Szlonsk, whose castles were erected here\r\nand there near the boundaries. It is true, that because of the war with\r\nthe Opolczyk, Naderspraw, whom the Silesians were helping against King\r\nWladyslaw, the majority of these castles had been destroyed by Polish\r\nhands; it was necessary, however, to be watchful, and especially after\r\nsunset, and to have one's weapons ready.\r\n\r\nThey were riding so quietly, however, that Zbyszko found the journey\r\ntedious; when they were about one day's journey from Bogdaniec, they\r\nheard the snorting and trampling of horses behind them.\r\n\r\n\"Some people are following us,\" said Zbyszko.\r\n\r\nMacko, who was awake, looked at the stars and answered like an\r\nexperienced traveler:\r\n\r\n\"Day-break is near. Robbers do not attack toward the end of the night.\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko stopped the wagon; however, placed the men across the road,\r\nfacing the advancing horses, and waited.\r\n\r\nIn fact, after a certain time he perceived in the dusk, several horsemen.\r\nOne of them was riding ahead, and it was evident that he did not wish to\r\nhide, because he was singing. Zbyszko could not hear the words of the\r\nsong; but the gay \"hoc! hoc!\" with which the stranger ended each refrain,\r\nreached his ears.\r\n\r\n\"Our people!\" he said to himself.\r\n\r\nAfter a while he shouted, however:\r\n\r\n\"Stop!\"\r\n\r\n\"And you sit down!\" answered a joyous voice.\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"And you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why do you follow us?\"\r\n\r\n\"And why do you obstruct the road?\"\r\n\r\n\"Answer, our crossbows are bent.\"\r\n\r\n\"And ours,--thrust out,--aimed!\"\r\n\r\n\"Answer like a man, otherwise woe to you!\"\r\n\r\nTo this a merry song was given, as an answer to Zbyszko.\r\n\r\n  \"One misery with another\r\n  They are dancing on the crossway.\r\n      Hoc! Hoc! Hoc!\r\n  What use have they of dancing?\r\n  It's a good thing, anyhow.\r\n      Hoc! Hoc! Hoc!\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko was amazed at hearing such an answer; meantime, the song stopped\r\nand the same voice asked:\r\n\r\n\"And how is the old man Macko? Does he still breathe?\"\r\n\r\nMacko rose in the wagon and said:\r\n\r\n\"For God's sake, they are some of our people!\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko rushed forward.\r\n\r\n\"Who asks about Macko?\"\r\n\r\n\"A neighbor. Zych of Zgorzelice. I have looked for you for a week and\r\ninquired about you from all on the road.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Rety!_[67] Uncle! Zych of Zgorzelice is here!\" shouted Zbyszko.\r\n\r\nThey began to greet each other joyfully because Zych was really their\r\nneighbor, and also a good man of whom everybody was very fond on account\r\nof his mirth.\r\n\r\n\"Well, how are you?\" asked he, shaking hands with Macko. \"Still _hoc_, or\r\nno more _hoc_!\"[68]\r\n\r\n\"Hej, no more _hoc_!\" answered Macko. \"But I see you gladly. Gracious\r\nGod, it is as if I were already in Bogdaniec.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter with you; I heard that the Germans had wounded you?\"\r\n\r\n\"They did, dog-brothers! I A head of a spear stuck between my ribs.\"\r\n\r\n\"You see!\" said Zbyszko, \"everybody advises the grease of a bear. As soon\r\nas we reach Bogdaniec, I will go with an axe to the _barcie_.\"[69]\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps Jagienka has some.\"\r\n\r\n\"What Jagienka? Your wife's name was Malgochna,\" said Macko.\r\n\r\n\"O! Malgochna is no more! It will be three years on St. Michael's day\r\nsince Malgochna was buried in the priests' field. She was a sturdy woman;\r\nmay the Lord make his face shine upon her soul! Jagienka is exactly like\r\nher, only younger.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Behind a ravine, there is a mount,\r\n  As was mother, such is daughter.\r\n      Hoc! Hoc!\"\r\n\r\n\"I told Malgochna not to climb the pine tree because she was no longer\r\nyoung. But she would climb it. The branch broke; she fell and was badly\r\nhurt; within three days, she died.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lord, make your face shine upon her soul!\" said Macko. \"I remember, I\r\nremember! When she was angry, the farm boys used to hide in the hay. But\r\nshe was clever. So she fell from a pine tree!\"\r\n\r\n\"She fell down like a cone. Do you know, after the funeral I was so\r\nstupefied with grief, that for three days they could not arouse me. They\r\nthought I was dead. Afterward, I wept for a long time. But Jagienka is\r\nalso clever. She takes care of everything.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can scarcely remember her. She was not as large as the helve of an axe\r\nwhen I went away. She could pass under a horse without touching its body.\r\nBah! that is a long time ago, and she must have grown.\"\r\n\r\n\"She was fifteen the day of St. Agnes; but I have not seen her for more\r\nthan a year.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why have you not seen her? Where have you been?\"\r\n\r\n\"To the war. I do not need to stay home; Jagienka takes care of\r\neverything.\"\r\n\r\nMacko, although ill, began to listen attentively when the war was\r\nmentioned, and asked:\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you were with _Kniaz_ Witold at Worskla?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I was there,\" answered Zych of Zgorzelice gaily. \"Well, the Lord\r\nGod did not send him good luck; we were dreadfully defeated by Edyga.\r\nFirst they killed our horses. A Tartar will not attack you openly like a\r\nChristian knight, but throws his arrows from afar. You attack him and he\r\nflees, and then again throws his arrows. What can you do with such a man?\r\nIn our army the knights boasted and said: 'We do not need to lower our\r\nspears, nor draw our swords; we will crush the vermin under our horses'\r\nfeet.' So they boasted; but when the arrows began to twange, it grew dark\r\nthey were so numerous, and the battle was soon over. Hardly one out of\r\nten survived. Will you believe it? More than half of the army were slain;\r\nseventy Lithuanian and Russian princes lay dead on the battlefield; and\r\none could not count in two weeks' time, the _bojars_ and other courtiers,\r\nwhom they call _otroks_, that were killed.\"\r\n\r\n\"I heard about it,\" interrupted Macko. \"Many of our knights perished\r\nalso.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah! even ten Knights of the Cross were killed, because they were\r\nobliged to serve in Witold's army. Many of our people perished, because\r\nthey, you know, never run away. _Kniaz_ Witold had the greatest\r\nconfidence in our knights and he wanted a guard of them round him during\r\nthe battle, exclusively Poles. Hi! Hi! Great havoc was made among them;\r\nbut he was not touched! _Pan_ Spytko of Mielsztyn was killed, also the\r\nsword bearer, Bernat, Judge Mikolaj, Prokop, Przeclaw, Dobrogost, Jasko\r\nof Lazewice, Pilik Mazur, Warsz of Michow, _Wojewoda_ Socha, Jasko of\r\nDombrowa, Pietrko of Miloslaw, Szczepiecki, Oderski and Tomko Lagoda. Who\r\ncan enumerate all of them! Some of them had been hit with so many arrows,\r\nthat after death they looked like porcupines; it was awful to look at\r\nthem!\"\r\n\r\nHere he laughed as if he were telling a most amusing story, and at once\r\nhe began to sing:\r\n\r\n  \"You have learned what is a Tartar,\r\n  When he beat you and flew afar!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, and what then?\" asked Zbyszko.\r\n\r\n\"Then the grand duke escaped; but he was as courageous as he usually is.\r\nThe more you press him, the farther he jumps, like a hazelnut stick. We\r\nrushed to the Tavanian ford to defend those crossing over. There were\r\nwith us a few knights from Poland. The second day, Edyga came with a\r\nswarm of Tartars; but he could not do a thing. Hej! When he wanted to\r\npass the ford, we fought him so hard he could not do it. We killed and\r\ncaught many of them. I myself caught five Tartars, and I sent them to\r\nZgorzelice. You will see what dogheads they have.\"\r\n\r\n\"In Krakow, they say that the war may reach Poland also.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do they think Edyga is a fool! He knows well what kind of knights we\r\nhave; and he also knows that the greatest knights remained home, because\r\nthe queen was not pleased when Witold began the war on his own authority.\r\nEj, he is cunning, that old Edyga! He understood at Tavania that the\r\nprince's army had increased and had gone far beyond the tenth-land!\"\r\n\r\n\"But you returned?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I returned. There is nothing to do there. In Krakow I heard about\r\nyou, and that you had started a little ahead of me.\"\r\n\r\nHere he turned to Zbyszko:\r\n\r\n\"Hej! my lord, the last time I saw you, you were a small boy; and now,\r\nalthough there is no light, I suppose you are large like an urus. And you\r\nhad your crossbows ready! One can see you have been in the war.\"\r\n\r\n\"War has nurtured me since childhood. Let my uncle tell you if I am\r\nlacking in experience.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not necessary for your uncle to tell me anything; in Krakow, I saw\r\nthe _Pan_ of Taczew who told me about you. But I understand that the\r\nMazur does not want to give you his daughter. I have nothing against you;\r\nbut I like you. You will forget about that one when you see my Jagienka.\r\nShe is a wonder!\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall not forget, even if I see ten such as your Jagna.\"\r\n\r\n\"She will get the estate of Moczydoly for her dowry. Many will ask me for\r\nJagna, do not fear?\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko wanted to answer: \"But not I!\" But Zych of Zgorzelice began to\r\nsing:\r\n\r\n  \"I will bend to your knees\r\n  And you for that, will give me the girl,\r\n    Give me the girl!\"\r\n\r\n\"You are always happy and singing,\" said Macko.\r\n\r\n\"Well, and what do the blessed do in heaven.\"\r\n\r\n\"They sing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then! And the damned cry. I prefer to go to those who sing rather\r\nthan to those who cry; and St. Peter will say thus: 'We must let him into\r\nparadise; otherwise he will sing in hell, and that will not be right.'\r\nLook, the day breaks!\"\r\n\r\nIn fact, daylight was coming. After awhile they arrived at a large glade.\r\nBy the lake covering the greater part of the glade, some people were\r\nfishing; but seeing the armed men, they left their nets and immediately\r\nseized their picks and staffs and stood ready for battle.\r\n\r\n\"They thought we were robbers,\" said Zych, laughing. \"Hej, fishermen! To\r\nwhom do you belong?\"\r\n\r\nThey stood for a while silently, looking distrustfully; but finally one\r\nof them having recognized that they were knights, answered:\r\n\r\n\"To the _ksiondz_, the abbot of Tulcza.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our relative,\" said Macko, \"the same who holds Bogdaniec in pledge.\r\nThese must be his forests; but he must have purchased them a short time\r\nago.\"\r\n\r\n\"He did not buy them,\" answered Zych. \"He was fighting about them with\r\nWilk of Brzozowa and it seems that the abbot defeated Wilk. A year ago\r\nthey were going to fight on horseback with spears and long swords for\r\nthis part of the forest; but I do not know how it ended because I went\r\naway.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we are relatives,\" said Macko, \"he will not quarrel with us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps; he is a chivalrous abbot who knows how to wear a helmet; but he\r\nis pious and he sings the mass beautifully. Don't you remember? When he\r\nshouts at mass, the swallows nested under the ceiling, fall from their\r\nnests. In that way God's glory increases.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly I remember! At ten steps he could blow the candles at the\r\naltar out. Has he been in Bogdaniec?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he was there. He settled five peasants on the land. He has also\r\nbeen at my house at Zgorzelice, because, as you know, he baptized\r\nJagienka, of whom he is very fond and calls her little daughter.\"\r\n\r\n\"God will bless him if he be willing to leave me the peasants,\" said\r\nMacko.\r\n\r\n\"_Owa!_ what will five peasants amount to! Then Jagienka will ask him and\r\nhe will not refuse her.\"\r\n\r\nHere the conversation stopped for a while, because over the dark forest\r\nand from the pink down, the bright sun had risen and lighted the\r\nenvirons. The knights greeted it with the customary: \"May it be blessed!\"\r\nand then having made the sign of the cross, they began their morning\r\nprayers.\r\n\r\nZych finished first and said to his companions:\r\n\r\n\"I hope to see you well soon. Hej! you have both changed. You, Macko,\r\nmust regain your health. Jagienka will take care of you, because there is\r\nno woman in your house. One can see that you have a piece of iron between\r\nyour ribs.\"\r\n\r\nHere he turned toward Zbyszko:\r\n\r\n\"Show yourself also. Well, mighty God! I remember you when you were small\r\nand used to climb on the colts by the help of their tails; and now, what\r\na knight! The face looks like that of a little lord; but the body like\r\nthat of a sturdy man. Such can wrestle even with a bear.\"\r\n\r\n\"A bear is nothing for him!\" said Macko. \"He was younger than he is\r\nto-day, when that Fryzjan called him a beardless youth; and he resenting\r\nit, immediately pulled out the Fryzjan's mustaches.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" interrupted Zych, \"and you fought afterward, and captured their\r\nretinue. _Pan_ of Taczew told me all about it:\"\r\n\r\n  \"There came a German very proud,\r\n  He was buried with sore snout;\r\n      Hoc! Hoc!\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko wondered at Zych's long thin figure, at his thin face with its\r\nenormous nose and at his laughing round eyes.\r\n\r\n\"O!\" said he, \"with such a neighbor there will be no sadness, if God only\r\nrestore my uncle's health.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is good to have a joyful neighbor, because with a jolly fellow there\r\nwill be no quarrel,\" answered Zych. \"Now listen to what I tell you. You\r\nhave been away from home a long time, and you will not find much comfort\r\nin Bogdaniec. I do not say in the farming, because the abbot has taken\r\ncare of that; he dug up a large piece of the forest and settled new\r\npeasants. But as he went there very often, you will find the larder\r\nempty; even in the house, there is hardly a bench or a bunch of straw to\r\nsleep on; and a sick man needs some comforts. You had better come with me\r\nto Zgorzelice. I will be glad to have you stay a month or two. During\r\nthat time, Jagienka will take care of Bogdaniec. Rely on her and do not\r\nbother yourselves with anything. Zbyszko can go there, from time to time,\r\nto inspect the farming; I will bring the abbot to Zgorzelice, and you can\r\nsettle your account with him. The girl will take good care of you, as of\r\na father, and during illness, a woman's care is the best. Well, my dear\r\nfriends, will you do as I ask you?\"\r\n\r\n\"We know that you are a good man and you always were,\" answered Macko\r\nwith emotion; \"but don't you see, if I must die on account of this wound,\r\nI prefer to die in my own home. Then when one is home, although he is\r\nold, he can inquire about different things, can inspect and do many other\r\nthings. If God order me to go to the other world, well, then I cannot\r\nhelp it! I cannot escape it even with better care. As for inconvenience,\r\nwe are accustomed to that at the war. Even a bunch of straw is pleasant\r\nto that one who, during several years, has slept on the bare ground. But\r\nI thank you for your kind heart and if I be not able to show you my\r\ngratitude, God will permit Zbyszko to do it.\"\r\n\r\nZych of Zgorzelice, who was noted for his kind heart and readiness to\r\noblige, began to insist: but Macko was firm: \"If I must die, it will be\r\nbetter to die in my own courtyard!\"\r\n\r\nHe had longed to see Bogdaniec for several years, therefore now, when he\r\nwas so near it, he must go there, even if it were his last night. God was\r\nmerciful, having permitted him who was so ill, to reach here.\r\n\r\nHe brushed away the tears gathered under his eyelids, with his hand,\r\nlooked around and said:\r\n\r\n\"If these are the woods of Wilk of Bizozowa we will be home this\r\nafternoon.\"\r\n\r\n\"They do not belong to Wilk of Bizozowa any longer; but to the abbot,\"\r\nsaid Zych.\r\n\r\nMacko smiled and said after awhile:\r\n\r\n\"If they belong to the abbot, then sometime, they may belong to us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah! awhile ago you were talking about death,\" said Zych joyfully, \"and\r\nnow you wish to outlive the abbot.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I will not outlive him; but Zbyszko may.\"\r\n\r\nFurther conversation was interrupted by the sound of horns in the forest.\r\nZych stopped his horse and began to listen.\r\n\r\n\"Somebody is hunting,\" said he. \"Wait.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps it is the abbot. It would be pleasant to meet him here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Keep quiet!\"\r\n\r\nHere he turned to his retinue.\r\n\r\n\"Stop!\"\r\n\r\nThey halted. The horns resounded nearer, and soon afterward the baying of\r\ndogs was heard.\r\n\r\n\"Stop!\" repeated Zych. \"They are coming toward us.\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko jumped from his horse and began to shout:\r\n\r\n\"Give me the crossbow! The beast may attack us! Hasten! Hasten!\"\r\n\r\nHaving seized the crossbow from the servant's hands, he rested it against\r\nthe ground, pressed it against his abdomen, bent, stretched his back like\r\na bow, and having seized the string with the fingers of both hands, he\r\npulled it on to the iron hook; then placed an arrow and sprang into the\r\nwoods.\r\n\r\n\"He stretched it without a crank!\" whispered Zych, astonished at such\r\ngreat strength.\r\n\r\n\"Ho, he is a strong boy!\" answered Macko, proudly.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the sound of horns and the barking of dogs stole nearer; all\r\nat once, at the right side of the forest, a heavy trampling resounded,\r\naccompanied by the crackling of broken branches and bushes--then out of\r\nthe thicket rushed an old bearded urus, with his gigantic head lowered,\r\nwith bloody eyes and panting tongue, breathless and terrible. Coming to a\r\nsmall ravine, he leaped it, but fell on his forelegs; but immediately he\r\narose, and a few seconds later he would have disappeared in the thicket\r\non the other side of the road, when the string of the crossbow twanged,\r\nthe whistling of the arrow resounded, the beast reared, turned, roared\r\ndreadfully and fell on the ground as if he were struck by a thunderbolt.\r\n\r\nZbyszko leaped from behind a tree, again stretched the crossbow, and\r\napproached the bull who was pawing the ground with his hind feet.\r\n\r\nBut having glanced at it, he turned quietly toward the retinue, and began\r\nto shout from afar:\r\n\r\n\"I hit him so hard that he is severely wounded!\"\r\n\r\n\"You are a strong boy!\" said Zych, riding toward him, \"with one arrow\r\nonly!\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah, it was near, and the speed was great. Come and see; not only the\r\niron, but even the shaft has disappeared under the left shoulder bone.\"\r\n\r\n\"The huntsmen must be near; they will claim the beast.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will not give it to them!\" answered Zbyszko. \"It was killed on the\r\nroad, and the road is not private property.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if it belong to the abbot?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then he may have it.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, several dogs came out of the forest. Having perceived the\r\nanimal, they rushed on him.\r\n\r\n\"Soon the huntsmen will appear,\" said Zych. \"Look! There they are, but\r\nthey do not see the beast yet. Stop! Stop! Here, here! Killed! Killed!\"\r\n\r\nThen he became silent, and sheltered his eyes with one hand; after a\r\nwhile, he said:\r\n\r\n\"For God's sake! what has happened? Have I become blind, or does it only\r\nseem so to me?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is some one on a piebald horse in the front,\" said Zbyszko.\r\n\r\nThen Zych exclaimed at once:\r\n\r\n\"Dear Jesus! It must be Jagienka!\"\r\n\r\nAnd he began to shout:\r\n\r\n\"Jagna! Jagna!\"\r\n\r\nThen he rushed forward; but before he could make his horse gallop,\r\nZbyszko perceived a most wonderful spectacle; he beheld a girl sitting\r\nlike a man, on a swift piebald horse, rushing toward them; she had a\r\ncrossbow in one hand and a boar-spear on her shoulders. Her floating hair\r\nwas full of hop strobiles; her face was bright like the dawn. Her shirt\r\nwas opened on the bosom, and she wore a _serdak_.[70] Having reached\r\nthem, she reined in her horse; for a while, her face expressed surprise,\r\nhesitation, joy; finally, being scarcely able to believe her own eyes,\r\nshe began to cry in a childish voice:\r\n\r\n\"_Tatulo_,[71] _tatus_[71] dearest!\"\r\n\r\nIn the twinkling of an eye, she jumped from her horse, and Zych\r\ndismounted also to welcome her; she threw her arms around his neck. Fora\r\nlong time, Zbyszko heard only the sounds of kisses and these two words:\r\n\"_Tatulo!_ Jagula! _Tatulo!_ Jagula!\" repeated in a joyful outburst.\r\n\r\nBoth retinues now approached, and Macko arrived also; they continued to\r\nrepeat: \"_Tatulo!_ Jagula!\" and still kissed each other. Finally Jagienka\r\nasked:\r\n\r\n\"Then you decided to return from the war? Are you well?\"\r\n\r\n\"From the war. Why should I not be well? And you? And the boys? Are they\r\nwell also? Yes, otherwise you would not run in the forest. But, my girl,\r\nwhat are you doing here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you see that I am hunting?\" answered Jagienka, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"In somebody else's woods?\"\r\n\r\n\"The abbot gave me permission. He even sent me experienced huntsmen and a\r\npack of hounds.\"\r\n\r\nHere she turned to the servants:\r\n\r\n\"Chase the dogs away, they will tear the skin!\"\r\n\r\nThen to Zych:\r\n\r\n\"Oj, how glad I am to see you!\" And they again kissed each other. When\r\nthey were through, Jagna said:\r\n\r\n\"We are far from home; we followed the beast. I am sure it must be more\r\nthan ten miles; the horses are exhausted. What a large urus! Did you\r\nnotice? He must have at least three of my arrows in him; the last one\r\nkilled him.\"\r\n\r\n\"He was killed by the last, but it was not yours; this knight killed\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nJagienka threw her hair back and looked at Zbyszko sharply, but not very\r\nfriendly.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know who he is?\" asked Zych.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know.\"\r\n\r\n\"No wonder you do not recognize him, because he has grown. Perhaps you\r\nwill recognize old Macko of Bogdaniec?\"\r\n\r\n\"For God's sake! is that Macko of Bogdaniec?\" exclaimed Jagienka.\r\n\r\nHaving approached the wagon, she kissed Macko's hand.\r\n\r\n\"It is you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is I; but I am obliged to ride in the wagon, because the Germans\r\nwounded me.\"\r\n\r\n\"What Germans? The war was with the Tartars?\"\r\n\r\n\"There was a war with the Tartars, but we were not in that war; we fought\r\nin the war in Lithuania, Zbyszko and I.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is Zbyszko?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you did not recognize Zbyszko?\" said Macko smiling.\r\n\r\n\"Is that man Zbyszko?\" exclaimed the girl, looking again at the young\r\nknight.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is he.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must give him a kiss, because he is an old acquaintance of yours,\"\r\nsaid Zych, mirthfully.\r\n\r\nJagienka turned gaily toward Zbyszko; but suddenly she retreated, and\r\nhaving covered her eyes with her hand, she said:\r\n\r\n\"I am bashful.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we have known each other since we were children,\" said Zbyszko.\r\n\r\n\"Aha! we know each other well. I remember when you made us a visit with\r\nMacko about eight years ago, and my _matula_[72] gave us some nuts with\r\nhoney; you being the elder, struck me with your fist and then ate all the\r\nnuts yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"He will not act like that now!\" said Macko. \"He has been with _Kniaz_\r\nWitold, and with the court in Krakow, and he has learned courtly\r\nmanners.\"\r\n\r\nBut Jagienka was now thinking about something else; turning toward\r\nZbyszko, she asked:\r\n\r\n\"Then you killed the urus?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must see where the arrow is.\"\r\n\r\n\"You cannot see it; it disappeared under the shoulder bone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be quiet; do not dispute,\" said Zych. \"We all saw him shoot the urus,\r\nand we saw something still better; he bent the bow without a crank.\"\r\n\r\nJagienka looked at Zbyszko for the third time, but now with astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"You bent the crossbow without a crank?\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko, detecting some doubt in her voice, rested the crossbow on the\r\nground, and bent it in the twinkling of an eye; then wishing to show that\r\nhe was familiar with knightly manners, he kneeled on one knee and handed\r\nthe bow to Jagienka. But the girl, instead of taking it from him,\r\nsuddenly blushed--she did not know why herself, and began to fasten the\r\nshirt, which, during the swift riding, had become opened on her bosom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nThe next day after their arrival at Bogdaniec, Macko and Zbyszko began to\r\nlook around their old home; they soon realized that Zych of Zgorzelice\r\nwas right when he told them that at first they would be uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nWith the farming they could get along quite well. There were several\r\nfields cultivated by the peasants whom the abbot had settled there.\r\nFormerly there had been much cultivated land in Bogdaniec; but after the\r\nbattle at Plowce[73] where the family Grady perished, there was a\r\nscarcity of working hands; and after the invasion of the Germans from\r\nSzlonsk and after the war of Nalenczs with Grzymalits, the formerly rich\r\nfields became overgrown with trees. Macko could not help it. In vain he\r\ntried for several years to bring farmers from Krzesnia and rent the land\r\nto them; they refused to come, preferring to remain on their own strips\r\nof land rather than to cultivate some one else's. His offer however\r\nattracted some shelterless men; in the different wars, he captured\r\nseveral slaves whom he married and settled in the houses; and in that way\r\nhe populated the village. But it was hard work for him; therefore as soon\r\nas he had an opportunity, Macko pledged the whole of Bogdaniec, thinking\r\nthat it would be easier for the powerful abbot to settle the land with\r\npeasants, and that the war would bring to him and to Zbyszko some people\r\nand money. In fact, the abbot was energetic. He had increased the working\r\nforce of Bogdaniec with five peasant families; he increased the stock of\r\ncattle and horses; then he built a barn, a stable and a cow house. But as\r\nhe did not live in Bogdaniec, he did not repair the house. Macko, who had\r\nhoped to find the _grodek_ surrounded with a ditch and hedge when he\r\nreturned, found everything just as he had left it, with this difference\r\nonly, that the walls were more crooked and seemed to be lower, because\r\nthey had settled deeper in the earth.\r\n\r\nThe house contained an enormous hall, two large rooms with alcoves, and a\r\nkitchen. In the rooms there were windows made of bladders; and in the\r\ncentre of each room, there was a fireplace made of lime, and the smoke\r\nescaped through a hole in the ceiling. From the ceilings now blackened\r\nfrom smoke, during former times used to hang the hams of boars, bears and\r\ndeer, rumps of roes, sides of beef and rolls of sausages. But now the\r\nhooks were empty as well as the shelves fastened to the walls, on which\r\nthey used to put the tin and earthen dishes. The walls beneath the\r\nshelves were no longer empty, however, because Zbyszko had ordered his\r\nservants to hang helmets, cuirasses, long swords and short swords on\r\nthem; and further along boar-spears and forks, caparisons and saddles.\r\nThe smoke blackened the weapons, and it was necessary to clean them very\r\noften. But Macko, who was careful, ordered the servants to put the costly\r\nclothes in the alcove in which his bed stood.\r\n\r\nIn the front rooms there stood near the windows, pine tables and benches\r\nof the same, on which the lords used to sit during the meals, with all\r\ntheir servants. People accustomed to war were easily satisfied; but in\r\nBogdaniec there was neither bread nor flour and no dishes. The peasants\r\nbrought what they could; Macko expected that the neighbors, as was then\r\ncustomary, would help him; and he was not mistaken, at least as far as\r\nZych of Zgorzelice was concerned.\r\n\r\nThe second day, when the old _wlodyka_ was sitting on a log in front of\r\nthe house, delighted with the bright autumn day, Jagienka came, riding a\r\nblack horse; she dismounted and approached Macko, out of breath on\r\naccount of fast riding, and rosy as an apple; she said:\r\n\r\n\"May you be blessed! _Tatulo_ sent me to inquire about your health.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am no worse,\" answered Macko; \"and at least I have slept in my own\r\nhouse.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you cannot be comfortable at all, and a sick person needs some\r\ncare.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are hardened people. It is true that at first there was no comfort;\r\nbut we were not hungry. We ordered an ox and two sheep killed, so there\r\nis plenty of meat. The women brought some flour and eggs; the worst is\r\nthat we have no dishes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I ordered my servants to load two wagons. On one there are two\r\nbeds and dishes, and on the other different provisions. There are some\r\ncakes and flour, some salt pork and dried mushrooms; there is a barrel of\r\nbeer and one of mead; in fact a little of everything we had in the\r\nhouse.\"\r\n\r\nMacko, who was grateful for this kindness, caressed Jagienka's head, and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"May God reward your father and you. When our housekeeping improves, we\r\nwill return the provisions.\"\r\n\r\n\"How clever you are! We are not like the Germans, who take back what they\r\ngive.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, so much more may God reward you. Your father told us what a good\r\nhousekeeper you are, and that you had taken care of Zgorzelice the whole\r\nyear?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes! If you need anything else, send somebody; but send some one who\r\nwill know what is needed, because a stupid servant never knows what he\r\nhas been sent for.\"\r\n\r\nHere Jagienka began to look round, and Macko having noticed it, smiled\r\nand asked:\r\n\r\n\"For whom are you looking?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am looking for no one!\"\r\n\r\n\"I will send Zbyszko to thank you and your father. Do you like Zbyszko?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have not looked at him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then look at him now, because he is just coming.\"\r\n\r\nIn fact Zbyszko was coming from the stable. He was dressed in a reindeer\r\njacket and round felt cap like those worn under the helmets; his hair was\r\nwithout a net, cut evenly over his eyebrows and hung in golden curls on\r\nhis shoulders; he walked swiftly, having noticed the girl; he was tall\r\nand graceful, looking like the shield-bearer of a rich nobleman.\r\n\r\nJagienka turned toward Macko as if to show that she came only to see him;\r\nbut Zbyszko welcomed her joyfully, and having taken hold of her hand,\r\nraised it to his mouth, notwithstanding her resistance.\r\n\r\n\"Why do you kiss my hand?\" asked she. \"Am I a priest?\"\r\n\r\n\"Such is the custom; you must not resist.\"\r\n\r\n\"Even if he had kissed both your hands,\" said Macko, \"it would not be\r\nenough for all that you have brought us.\"\r\n\r\n\"What have you brought?\" asked Zbyszko, looking around the court-yard;\r\nbut he did not see anything except the black horse tied to the post.\r\n\r\n\"The wagons have not come yet; but they will soon be here,\" answered\r\nJagienka.\r\n\r\nMacko began to enumerate what she had brought; but when he mentioned the\r\ntwo beds, Zbyszko said:\r\n\r\n\"I am satisfied to sleep on the urus' skin; but I thank you because you\r\nthought about me also.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was not I; it was _Tatulo_,\" answered the girl, blushing. \"If you\r\nprefer to sleep on the skin, you can do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I prefer to sleep on what I can. Sometimes after a battle, I slept with\r\na dead Krzyzak instead of a pillow under my head.\"\r\n\r\n\"You do not mean to tell me that you have ever killed a Krzyzak? I am\r\nsure you have not.\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko, instead of answering, began to laugh. But Macko exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"For heaven's sake, girl, you do not know him yet! He has never done\r\nanything else, but kill the Germans. He can fight with an axe, a spear or\r\nwith any weapon; and when he sees a German from afar, one must tie him\r\nwith a rope, or else he will rush against him. In Krakow he wanted to\r\nkill the envoy, Lichtenstein, and for that he barely escaped execution.\r\nSuch a man! I will tell you also about the two Fryzes, from whom we took\r\ntheir retinues and so much rich booty, that one could redeem Bogdaniec\r\nwith half of it.\"\r\n\r\nHere Macko began to tell about his duel with the Fryzjans; also about\r\nother adventures which had happened to them, and about the deeds they had\r\nperformed. How they had fought from behind the walls and in the open\r\nfields, with the greatest knights living in foreign lands; how they had\r\nfought Germans, Frenchmen, Englishmen and Burgundians. He also told her\r\nwhat they had seen! They had seen German castles of red brick, Lithuanian\r\nwooden _grodzce_[74] and churches, more beautiful than one could see\r\naround Bogdaniec; also large cities and the dreadful wilderness in which\r\nduring the nights Lithuanian gods cried, and many different, marvelous\r\nthings; and everywhere, in any fight, Zbyszko was victorious, so that\r\neven the greatest knights were astonished at him.\r\n\r\nJagienka, who was sitting on the log beside Macko, listened with open\r\nmouth to that narrative, tossing her head and looking at the young knight\r\nwith increasing admiration and amazement. Finally when Macko was through,\r\nshe sighed and said:\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry I was not born a boy!\"\r\n\r\nBut Zbyszko, who during the narration had been looking at her\r\nattentively, evidently was thinking about something else, because he\r\nsuddenly said:\r\n\r\n\"What a beautiful girl you are now!\"\r\n\r\nJagienka answered, half in displeasure and half in sadness:\r\n\r\n\"You have seen many more beautiful than I am.\"\r\n\r\nBut Zbyszko could truly answer her that he had not seen many as pretty as\r\nshe, because Jagienka was beaming with health, youth and strength. The\r\nold abbot used to say that she looked like a pine tree. Everything was\r\nbeautiful in her; a slender figure, a broad bosom that looked as if it\r\nwere cut out of marble, a red mouth, and intelligent blue eyes. She was\r\nalso dressed with more care than when in the forest with the hunting\r\nparty. Around her neck she had a necklace of red beads; she wore a fur\r\njacket opened in front and covered with green cloth, a homespun skirt and\r\nnew boots. Even old Macko noticed this beautiful attire, and having\r\nlooked at her for a moment, asked:\r\n\r\n\"Why are you dressed as if you were going to church?\"\r\n\r\nBut instead of answering, she exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"The wagons are coming!\"\r\n\r\nIn fact the wagons now appeared and she sprang toward them, followed by\r\nZbyszko. The unloading lasted quite a long time to the great satisfaction\r\nof Macko who looked at everything, and praised Jagienka all the time. It\r\nwas dusk when the girl started home. While she was getting ready to mount\r\nher horse, Zbyszko suddenly caught her, and before she was able to say a\r\nword, lifted her into the saddle. Then she blushed like the dawn and\r\nturning her head toward him, said with emotion in her voice:\r\n\r\n\"What a strong boy you are!\"\r\n\r\nBut he, not having noticed her confusion nor her blushes because it was\r\ndark, laughed and said:\r\n\r\n\"Are you not afraid of wild beasts? It is night!\"\r\n\r\n\"There is a boar-spear in the wagon. Give it to me.\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko went to the wagon, took the boar-spear and handed it to Jagienka;\r\nthen he said:\r\n\r\n\"Be in good health!\"\r\n\r\n\"Be in good health!\" she answered.\r\n\r\n\"May God reward you! To-morrow, or the day after, I will be in Zgorzelice\r\nto thank Zych and you for your kindness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come! You will be welcome!\"\r\n\r\nHaving touched her horse, she disappeared among the bushes growing on the\r\nsides of the road.\r\n\r\nZbyszko returned to his uncle.\r\n\r\n\"You must go inside.\"\r\n\r\nBut Macko answered, without moving from the log:\r\n\r\n\"Hej! I what a girl! I She made the court-yard brighter!\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a moment of silence. Macko seemed to be thinking about\r\nsomething while looking at the stars; then he said, as if he were\r\nspeaking to himself:\r\n\r\n\"She is pretty and a good housekeeper, although she is not more than\r\nfifteen years old.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes!\" answered Zbyszko. \"Therefore old Zych loves her dearly.\"\r\n\r\n\"And he said that the estate of Moczydoly will be her dowry; and there on\r\nthe pastures is a herd of mares with many colts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are there not a great many marshes in the Moczydlowski estate?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but in those marshes there are plenty of beavers.\"\r\n\r\nThere was silence again. Macko looked intently at Zbyszko for a while,\r\nand finally he asked, \"About what are you thinking?\"\r\n\r\n\"Seeing Jagienka reminded me of Danusia, and something pricked me in the\r\nheart.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us go into the house,\" answered the old _wlodyka_. \"It is getting\r\nlate.\"\r\n\r\nHaving risen with difficulty, he leaned on Zbyszko, who conducted him to\r\nthe alcove.\r\n\r\nThe next day Zbyszko went to Zgorzelice, because Macko urged him. He also\r\ninsisted that he take two servants with him for ostentation, and that he\r\ndress in his best clothes, to show respect and gratitude to Zych. Zbyszko\r\ndid as he was asked and went attired as if for a wedding, in his _jaka_\r\nmade of white satin, bordered with gold fringe and embroidered with gold\r\ngriffins. Zych received him with open arms, with joy and with singing; as\r\nfor Jagienka, when she entered, she stopped as if she were rooted to the\r\nground and almost dropped the bucket of wine which she was carrying; she\r\nthought that a son of some king had arrived. She became timid and sat\r\nsilently, rubbing her eyes from time to time as if she would like to\r\nawaken from a dream. The inexperienced Zbyszko thought that, for some\r\nreason unknown to him, she did not wish to talk to him; therefore he\r\nconversed only with Zych, praising his munificence and admiring the house\r\nat Zgorzelice, which in fact was quite different from that in Bogdaniec.\r\n\r\nEverywhere comfort and wealth were evident. In the rooms there were\r\nwindows with panes made of horn, cut in thin slices and polished so that\r\nit was as transparent as glass. Instead of fireplaces in the centre,\r\nthere were large chimneys in the corners. The floors were made of larch\r\ntree planks, while on the walls were hung suits of armor and many\r\npolished dishes, also silver spoons. Here and there were costly rugs\r\nbrought from the wars. Under the tables there were enormous urus' skins.\r\nZych showed his riches willingly, saying that it was Jagienka's\r\nhousehold. He conducted Zbyszko to the alcove, fragrant with rosin and\r\npeppermint, in which were hanging from the ceiling, large bunches of wolf\r\nskins, fox skins, beaver skins and marten skins. He showed to him the\r\nprovisions of cheese, honey, wax, barrels of flour, pails of dried bread,\r\nhemp and dried mushrooms. Then he went with him to the granaries, barns,\r\nstables, cow houses, and to the sheds filled with plenty of hunting\r\nimplements and nets. Zbyszko was so dazzled by all this wealth that\r\nduring supper, he could not refrain from admiration.\r\n\r\n\"What a pleasure to live in Zgorzelice!\" exclaimed he.\r\n\r\n\"In Moczydoly, there is almost the same wealth,\" answered Zych. \"Do you\r\nremember Moczydoly? It is not far from Bogdaniec. Formerly our\r\nforefathers quarreled about the boundaries and challenged each other; but\r\nI shall not quarrel.\"\r\n\r\nHere he filled Zbyszko's goblet with mead and said:\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you would like to sing?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered Zbyszko; \"but I shall listen to you with pleasure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Zgorzelice will belong to the young bears.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by 'young bears?'\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Jagienka's brothers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hej! they will not have to suck their paws during the winter.\"\r\n\r\n\"No; but Jagienka will also have plenty in Moczydoly.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you eat and drink? Jagienka, pour for him and for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am drinking and eating as much as I can.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ungird your belt; then you will be able to eat and drink more. What a\r\nbeautiful girdle you have! Yon must have taken rich booty in Lithuania!\"\r\n\r\n\"We cannot complain,\" answered Zbyszko, gladly seizing the opportunity to\r\nexplain that the heirs of Bogdaniec were no longer _wlodykas_. \"A part of\r\nour booty, we sold in Krakow and received forty silver _grzywiens_ for\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't say so! Why, one can buy an estate for that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. There was one Milanese armor which my uncle, expecting to die, sold\r\nfor a good price.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know! Well, it is worth while to go to Lithuania. I wanted to go there\r\nalso; but I was afraid.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of what? Of the Knights of the Cross?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ej, who would be afraid of Germans? I was afraid of those heathenish\r\ngods or devils. It seems there are plenty of them in the woods.\"\r\n\r\n\"They do not have any other place for shelter, because their temples have\r\nbeen burned. Formerly they were well-to-do; but now they live on\r\nmushrooms and ants.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you see them?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I did not see any myself; but I heard of people who had seen them.\r\nSometimes one of them sticks out a hairy paw from behind a tree and\r\nshakes it, begging for something.\"\r\n\r\n\"Macko told me the same,\" answered Jagienka.\r\n\r\n\"Yes! He told me about it on the road,\" said Zych. \"Well, no wonder! In\r\nour country also, although it has been a Christian country for a long\r\ntime, one can hear laughter in the marshes; and although the priests\r\nscold about it in the churches, it is always good policy to put a dish\r\nfilled with something to eat, for the little devils; otherwise they will\r\nscratch on the walls so much that one can hardly sleep. Jagienka, my\r\ndearest! put a dish at the threshold.\"\r\n\r\nJagienka took an earthen porringer full of noodles and cheese, and placed\r\nit at the threshold. Zych said:\r\n\r\n\"The priests scold! But the Lord Jesus will not be angry about a dish of\r\nnoodles; and a god, as soon as his hunger is satisfied, will protect one\r\nfrom fire and from thieves.\"\r\n\r\nThen he turned to Zbyszko:\r\n\r\n\"But will you not ungird yourself and sing a little?\"\r\n\r\n\"You had better sing, or perhaps _Panna_[75] Jagienka will sing.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will sing by turns,\" exclaimed Zych. \"We have a servant who will\r\naccompany us on a wooden fife. Call the boy!\"\r\n\r\nThey called the servant who sat down on the bench and put the fife to his\r\nmouth, waiting to learn whom he was to accompany.\r\n\r\nNone of them wanted to be first. Finally Zych told Jagienka to begin;\r\ntherefore Jagienka, although bashful because Zbyszko was present, rose\r\nfrom the bench and having put her hands under her apron, began:\r\n\r\n  \"If I only could get\r\n  The wings like a birdie,\r\n  I would fly quickly\r\n  To my dearest Jasiek.\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko opened his eyes wide; then he jumped up and shouted:\r\n\r\n\"Where did you learn that song?\"\r\n\r\nJagienka looked at him astonished.\r\n\r\n\"Everybody sings that. What is the matter with you?\"\r\n\r\nZych thinking that Zbyszko was a little intoxicated, turned his jovial\r\nface toward him and said:\r\n\r\n\"Ungird! It will relieve you!\"\r\n\r\nBut Zbyszko stood for a while with astonishment on his face; then, having\r\nrecovered from his emotion, said to Jagienka:\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me, I suddenly remembered something. Sing further.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps it makes you sad?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ej, not at all!\" he answered, with a quivering voice. \"I could listen to\r\nit the whole night.\"\r\n\r\nThen he sat down, covered his face with his hand, and listened.\r\n\r\nJagienka sang another couplet; but when she finished, she noticed a big\r\ntear rolling down Zbyszko's fingers.\r\n\r\nThen she sat down beside him, and began to touch him with her elbow.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter with you? I do not want to make you cry. Tell me what\r\nis the matter with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing! Nothing!\" answered Zbyszko, sighing. \"I could tell you much.\r\nBut it is over. I feel merry now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you would like to have some sweet wine?\"\r\n\r\n\"Good girl!\" exclaimed Zych. \"Call him 'Zbyszko,' and you call her\r\n'Jagienka.' You have known each other since you were children.\"\r\n\r\nThen he turned toward his daughter:\r\n\r\n\"Do not mind because he struck you when you were children. He will not do\r\nit now.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will not!\" answered Zbyszko, mirthfully. \"If she wishes, she may beat\r\nme now for it.\"\r\n\r\nThen Jagienka, wishing to cheer him up, began to play that she was\r\nstriking him with her little fist.\r\n\r\n\"Give us some wine!\" shouted the merry _Pan_ of Zgorzelice.\r\n\r\nJagienka sprang to the closet and brought out a jug of wine, two\r\nbeautiful silver goblets, engraved by a silversmith of Wroclaw[76] and a\r\ncouple of cheese.\r\n\r\nZych, being a little intoxicated, began to hug the jug and said to it as\r\nif he were talking to his daughter:\r\n\r\n\"Oj, my dear girl! What shall I do, poor man, when they take you from\r\nZgorzelice; what shall I do?\"\r\n\r\n\"And you must give her up soon!\" said Zbyszko.\r\n\r\nZych began to laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Chy! Chy! The girl is only fifteen; but she is already fond of boys!\r\nWhen she sees one of them, she begins immediately to rub knee with knee!\"\r\n\r\n\"_Tatusiu_[77] if you don't stop, I will leave you,\" said Jagienka.\r\n\r\n\"Don't go! It's better with you here.\" Then he continued to say to\r\nZbyszko:\r\n\r\n\"Two of them visit us. One of them is young Wilk, the son of old Wilk of\r\nBizozowa; the other is Cztan[78] of Rogow. If they meet you here, they\r\nwill gnash their teeth, as they do at each other.\"\r\n\r\n\"Owa!\" said Zbyszko. Then he turned to Jagienka and asked:\r\n\r\n\"Which do you prefer?\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wilk is a great boy,\" said Zych.\r\n\r\n\"Let him go in another direction!\"\r\n\r\n\"And Cztan?\"\r\n\r\nJagienka began to laugh:\r\n\r\n\"Cztan,\" said she, turning toward Zbyszko, \"he has hair on his face like\r\na goat; one can hardly see his eyes; and he has as much grease on him as\r\na bear.\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko now touched his head with his hand as if he had just remembered\r\nsomething important, and said:\r\n\r\n\"I must ask you for one thing more; have you any bear's grease? I want to\r\nuse it for medicine for my uncle; and I could not find any in Bogdaniec.\"\r\n\r\n\"We used to have some,\" answered Jagienka; \"but the boys have used some\r\nto grease their bows, and the dogs have eaten the rest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there none left?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, I must find some in the forest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have a hunting party for bears; there are plenty of them; and if you\r\nwant some hunting implements, we will lend you some.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot wait. I will go some night to a _barcie_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take a few men with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I shall not do that, for they will frighten the beast.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you will take a crossbow!\"\r\n\r\n\"What can I do with a crossbow during the night? There is no moon now! I\r\nwill take a fork and a strong axe, and I will go alone to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nJagienka was silent for awhile; but great uneasiness was reflected on her\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\"Last year,\" said she, \"the huntsman, Bezduch, was killed by a bear. It\r\nis dangerous, because as soon as the bear sees a man near the _barcie_,\r\nhe immediately stands up on his hind feet.\"\r\n\r\n\"If he ran away, I could not get him,\" answered Zbyszko.\r\n\r\nAt that moment Zych who had been dozing, suddenly awakened and began to\r\nsing:\r\n\r\n  \"Thou Kuba, of toil\r\n  I Maciek of pleasure,\r\n  Go then in the morning with the yoke in the field,\r\n  While I amuse myself with Kasia.\"\r\n\r\nThen he said to Zbyszko:\r\n\r\n\"You know? There are two of them, Wilk of Brzozowa and Cztan of Rogow;\r\nand you?\"\r\n\r\nBut Jagienka being afraid that Zych would say too much, swiftly\r\napproached Zbyszko, and began to inquire:\r\n\r\n\"When are you going? To-morrow?\"\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow after sunset.\"\r\n\r\n\"And to which _barcie_?\"\r\n\r\n\"To ours in Bogdaniec, not far from your boundaries, near the marshes of\r\nRadzikow. They tell me it is very easy to get a bear there.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nZbyszko went for the bear as he proposed, because Macko became worse. At\r\nfirst when he reached Bogdaniec, he was sustained by joy and the first\r\ncares about the house; but on the third day, the fever returned, and the\r\npain was so great that he was obliged to go to bed. Zbyszko went to the\r\n_barcie_ during the day, and while there he perceived that there were the\r\nfootprints of a bear in the mud. He spoke to the beehive keeper, Wawrek,\r\nwho slept in a shed not far away, with his two faithful Podhalan[79]\r\ndogs; but he intended to return to the village on account of the cold.\r\n\r\nThey destroyed the shed, and Wawrek took the dogs with him. But first\r\nthey smeared the trees here and there with honey, so that the smell of it\r\nwould attract the animal. Zbyszko returned home and began to prepare for\r\nthe expedition. He dressed himself in a warm reindeer jacket without\r\nsleeves; on the top of his head, he put a bonnet made of iron wire;\r\nfinally he took a strong fork and a steel axe. Before sunset he had taken\r\nhis position; and having made the sign of the cross, he sat down and\r\nwaited.\r\n\r\nThe red beams of the setting sun were still shining between the branches\r\nof the gigantic pines. In the tops of the trees, the crows were flying,\r\ncroaking and beating the air with their wings; here and there the hares\r\nwere leaping toward the water, making a noise on the dried leaves; some\r\ntimes a swift marten passed by. In the thickets, the chirping of the\r\nbirds was at first heard--but gradually ceased.\r\n\r\nAfter sunset the noises of the forest began. Immediately a pack of boars\r\npassed near Zbyszko with a great bustle and snorting; then elks galloped\r\nin a long row, each holding his head on the tail of the one in front of\r\nhim. The dried branches crackled under their feet and the forest\r\nresounded; but on they rushed toward the marshes where during the night,\r\nthey were cool and safe. Finally the twilight was reflected on the sky,\r\nand the tops of the pine trees illuminated by it seemed to burn, as if on\r\nfire; then little by little everything began to be quieted. The forest\r\nwas still. Dusk was rising from earth toward the gleaming twilight, which\r\nbegan finally to grow fainter, then gloomy, blacker and then was\r\nquenched.\r\n\r\n\"Now, everything will be quiet, until the wolves begin to howl,\" thought\r\nZbyszko.\r\n\r\nHe regretted that he had not taken his crossbow, because he could easily\r\nhave killed a boar or an elk. In the meanwhile, from the marshes came\r\nmuffled sounds similar to heavy panting and whistling. Zbyszko looked\r\ntoward that marsh with some apprehension, because the peasant, Radzik,\r\nwho used to live here in an earth-hut, disappeared with his whole family,\r\nas if devoured by the earth. Some people said they were seized by\r\nrobbers; but there were others who saw some strange footprints, neither\r\nhuman nor of beasts, round the cabin. The people shook their heads very\r\nmuch about that, and they even spoke about bringing a priest from\r\nKrzesnia, to bless the hut. But they did not do it because nobody was\r\nwilling to live in that hut, which from that time, had an evil\r\nreputation. It is true that the beehive keeper, Wawrek, did not pay any\r\nattention to these reports.\r\n\r\nZbyszko being armed with the fork and axe, was not afraid of the wild\r\nbeasts; but he thought with some uneasiness about the evil forces, and he\r\nwas glad when that noise stopped.\r\n\r\nThe last reverberation ceased, and there was complete silence. The wind\r\nstopped blowing and there was not even the usual whispering in the tops\r\nof the pine trees. From time to time, a pine cone fell, making quite a\r\nnoise amidst the deep silence; but in general, everything was so quiet\r\nthat Zbyszko heard his own respirations.\r\n\r\nThus he sat quietly for a long time, thinking first about the bear, and\r\nthen about Danusia. He recollected how he seized her in his arms when\r\nbidding the princess farewell, and how she cried; he remembered her fair\r\nhead and bright face, her wreaths of bachelor buttons, her singing, her\r\nred shoes with long tips, and finally everything that happened from the\r\nmoment he first saw her. Such a longing to see her, filled his heart,\r\nthat he forgot that he was in the forest waiting for the bear; instead of\r\nthat he began to talk to himself:\r\n\r\n\"I will go to see you, because I cannot live without you.\"\r\n\r\nHe felt that he must go to Mazowsze; that if he remained in Bogdaniec, he\r\nwould become good for nothing. He recollected Jurand and his strange\r\nopposition; then he thought that it was even more necessary he should go,\r\nand learn what that obstacle was, and if a challenge to combat could not\r\nremove it. Finally it seemed to him that Danusia stretched her bands\r\ntoward him and cried:\r\n\r\n\"Come, Zbyszku! Come!\" How could he refuse?\r\n\r\nHe was not sleeping, but he saw her as distinctly as in a dream. There\r\nshe was, riding beside the princess, thrumming on her little lute,\r\nhumming and thinking of him. Thinking that she would soon see him, and\r\nperhaps looking back.\r\n\r\nHero Zbyszko aroused himself and listened, because he heard a rustling\r\nbehind him. Then he grasped the fork in his hand more tightly, stretched\r\nhis neck and listened again.\r\n\r\nThe rustling approached and then it became very distinct. Under some\r\ncareful foot, the dried branches were crackling, the fallen leaves were\r\nrustling. Something was coming.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time the rustling ceased, as if the beast halted beneath the\r\ntrees; then there was such quietude that Zbyszko's ears began to ring;\r\nthen again slow, careful steps were heard. That approach was so cautious\r\nthat Zbyszko was surprised.\r\n\r\n\"I am sure 'the old'[80] must be afraid of the dogs which were here in\r\nthe shed,\" said he to himself; \"but it may be a wolf that has scented\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nNow the footsteps were no longer heard. Zbyszko, however, was sure that\r\nsomething had stopped twenty or thirty feet behind him.\r\n\r\nHe turned around once or twice; but although he could see the trunks of\r\nthe trees quite well, he could not perceive anything else. He was obliged\r\nto wait.\r\n\r\nHe waited so long, that he was surprised a second time.\r\n\r\n\"A bear would not come here to stop under the _barcie_; and a wolf would\r\nnot wait until morning.\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly a shiver ran through his body as he thought:\r\n\r\n\"Suppose it is something dreadful that comes from the marshes and is\r\ntrying to surprise me from the rear! Suppose the slippery arms of a\r\ndrowned man seize me, or the green eyes of a ghost look into my face;\r\nsuppose a blue head on spider's legs comes out from behind the tree and\r\nbegins to laugh!\"\r\n\r\nHe felt his hair begin to rise under his iron bonnet.\r\n\r\nBut after a while, a rustling sounded in front of him, more distinct this\r\ntime than formerly. Zbyszko breathed more freely; he thought that the\r\nsame \"wonder\" had gone around him, and now approached from the front; but\r\nhe preferred that. He seized his fork firmly, arose quietly and waited.\r\n\r\nNow he noticed over his head the rustling of the pine trees, and he felt\r\nthe wind blow in his face, coming from the marsh, and he smelt the bear.\r\n\r\nThere was not the slightest doubt that a _mys_[81] was coming!\r\n\r\nZbyszko was afraid no longer, and having bent his head, he strained to\r\nthe utmost his hearing and his sight. Heavy, distinct steps were coming;\r\nthe smell grew stronger; soon the snore and groaning were heard.\r\n\r\n\"I hope there are not two of them!\" thought Zbyszko.\r\n\r\nBut at that moment, he perceived in front of him the large, dark form of\r\nthe animal, which was walking in the same direction from which the wind\r\nwas blowing, and could not get the scent of him; its attention was also\r\nattracted by the smell of the honey on the trees.\r\n\r\n\"Come, uncle!\" exclaimed Zbyszko, coming out from beneath the pine tree.\r\n\r\nThe bear roared shortly as if frightened by an unexpected apparition; but\r\nhe was too near to seek safety in flight; therefore, in a moment he\r\nreared and separated his forelegs as if for a hug. This was exactly what\r\nZbyszko was waiting for; he gathered himself together, jumped like\r\nlightning and with all the strength of his powerful arms and of his\r\nweight, he drove the fork into the animal's chest.\r\n\r\nThe whole forest resounded now with the fearful roaring. The bear seized\r\nthe fork with his paws, and tried to pull it out, but the incisions made\r\nby the points were too deep; therefore, feeling the pain, he roared still\r\nmore fearfully. Wishing to reach Zbyszko, he leaned on the fork and thus\r\ndrove it into his body still further. Zbyszko, not knowing that the\r\npoints had entered so deeply, held on to the handle. The man and the\r\nanimal began to struggle. The forest again resounded with the roaring in\r\nwhich wrath and despair were mingled.\r\n\r\nZbyszko could not use his axe until after he could drive the sharpened\r\nend of the fork into the ground. The bear having seized the handle, was\r\nshaking it as well as Zbyszko, and notwithstanding the pain caused by\r\nevery movement of the points imbedded in his breast, he would not let it\r\nbe \"underpropped.\" In this way the terrible struggle continued, and\r\nZbyszko finally felt that his strength would soon be exhausted. If he\r\nfell, then he would be lost; therefore, he gathered all his strength,\r\nstrained his arms to the utmost, set his feet firmly and bent his back\r\nlike a bow, so as not to be thrown backward; and in his enthusiasm he\r\nrepeated through set teeth:\r\n\r\n\"You or I will die!\"\r\n\r\nSuch anger filled him that he really preferred at that moment to die,\r\nrather than to let the beast go. Finally his foot caught in the root of a\r\ntree; he tottered and would have fallen, if at that moment a dark figure\r\nhad not appeared before him, and another fork \"underpropped\" the beast;\r\nand in the meanwhile, a voice shouted near his ear:\r\n\r\n\"Use your axe!\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko, being excited by the fight, did not wonder even for a moment\r\nfrom whence came the unexpected help; but he seized the axe and cut with\r\nall his might. The fork cracked, broken by the weight and by the last\r\nconvulsion of the beast, as it fell. There was a long silence broken only\r\nby Zbyszko's loud respirations. But after a while, he lifted his head,\r\nlooked at the form standing beside him and was afraid, thinking that it\r\nmight not be a man.\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\" asked he, with uneasiness.\r\n\r\n\"Jagienka!\" answered a thin, womanly voice.\r\n\r\nZbyszko became dumb from astonishment; he could not believe his own eyes.\r\nBut his doubts did not last long, because Jagienka's voice again\r\nresounded:\r\n\r\n\"I will build a fire.\"\r\n\r\nImmediately the clatter of a fire steel against a flint sounded and the\r\nsparks began to fall; by their glittering light, Zbyszko beheld the white\r\nforehead, the dark eyebrows and the red lips of the girl who was blowing\r\non the tinder which began to burn. Not until then did he realize that she\r\nhad come to the forest to help him, and that without her aid, he would\r\nhave perished. He felt such gratitude toward her, that he impulsively\r\nseized her around the waist and kissed her on both cheeks.\r\n\r\nThe tinder and the steel fell to the ground.\r\n\r\n\"Let me be!\" she began to repeat in a muffled voice; but she allowed him\r\nto kiss her and even, as if by accident, touched Zbyszko's lips with her\r\nmouth. He released her and said:\r\n\r\n\"May God reward you. I do not know what would have happened without your\r\nhelp.\"\r\n\r\nThen Jagienka, while searching for the tinder and fire steel, began to\r\nexcuse herself:\r\n\r\n\"I was worried about you, because Bezduch also went with a fork and an\r\naxe, but the bear tore him to pieces. If you met with such a misfortune,\r\nMacko would be very desolate, and he hardly breathes now. So I took a\r\nfork and came.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then it was you whom I heard there behind the pines?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I thought it was an evil spirit.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was very much frightened, because it is dangerous to be without fire\r\nhere around the Radzikowski marshes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why did you not speak to me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I was afraid you would send me away.\"\r\n\r\nHaving said this, she again began to strike sparks from the steel, and\r\nput on the tinder a bundle of hemp which began to burn.\r\n\r\n\"I have two resinous pieces of wood,\" said she; \"you bring some dried\r\nbranches quickly, and we will soon have a fire.\"\r\n\r\nIn fact, after a while a bright fire was burning, and lighted the\r\nenormous, brown body of the bear which was lying in a pool of blood.\r\n\r\n\"Hej, a dreadful beast!\" said Zbyszko, boastfully.\r\n\r\n\"You split his head entirely open! O, Jesus!\"\r\n\r\nThen she leaned over and felt of the bear's body, to ascertain whether\r\nthe beast was fat; then she arose with a bright face, and said:\r\n\r\n\"There will be plenty of grease for two years.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the fork is broken, look!\"\r\n\r\n\"That is too bad; what shall I tell them at home?\"\r\n\r\n\"About what?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Tatus_ would not let me come into the forest, therefore I was obliged\r\nto wait until everybody had retired.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a moment she added:\r\n\r\n\"You must not tell that I was here, because they will laugh at me.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I will go with you to your house, because I am afraid the wolves\r\nwill attack you, and you have no fork.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well!\"\r\n\r\nThus they sat talking for a while beside the bright fire, looking like\r\ntwo young forest creatures.\r\n\r\nZbyszko looked at the girl's pretty face, lighted by the flames, and said\r\nwith involuntary admiration:\r\n\r\n\"There is not another girl in this world as brave as you are. You ought\r\nto go to the war!\"\r\n\r\nShe looked into his face and then she answered, almost sadly:\r\n\r\n\"I know; but you must not laugh at me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nJagienka herself melted a large pot of bear's grease. Macko drank the\r\nfirst quart willingly, because it was fresh, and smelt good. Jagienka put\r\nthe rest of it in a pot. Macko's hope increased; he was sure he would be\r\ncured.\r\n\r\n\"That is what I needed,\" said he. \"When all parts inside of me become\r\ngreasy, then that dog's splinter will slip out.\"\r\n\r\nBut the next quarts did not taste as well as the first; but he continued\r\nto drink it and Jagienka encouraged him, saying:\r\n\r\n\"You will get well. Zbilud of Ostrog had the links of a coat of mail\r\ndriven into his neck; but they slipped out because he drank grease. But\r\nwhen your wound opens, you must put some grease of a beaver on it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you some?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we have. But if it be necessary to have it fresh, we will go with\r\nZbyszko and get a beaver. Meanwhile it would not do any harm, if you\r\npromised something to some saint, who is the patron for wounds.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was thinking about that, but I do not know to whom I should make the\r\npromise. Saint George is the patron of knights; he protects the warrior\r\nfrom any accident and always gives him victory, and it is said that\r\nsometimes he fights personally for the one who is right. But a saint who\r\nfights willingly, does not heal willingly; and for that, there must be\r\nanother saint with whom he would not want to interfere. It is known that\r\nevery saint has his specialty. But they will not interfere with one\r\nanother; because that would cause quarrels, and it is not proper to fight\r\nin heaven. There are Kosma and Damian to whom all doctors pray, that\r\nillness may exist; otherwise the doctors would not have anything to eat.\r\nThere is Saint Apolonia for the teeth and Saint Liborius for stone; but\r\nthey will not do for me. The abbot, when he comes, will tell me whom I\r\nmust ask. Every _clericus_ does not know all celestial secrets and\r\neveryone of them is not familiar with such things, but the abbot is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose you make a vow to the Lord Jesus himself?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course he is over all of them. But suppose your father had injured my\r\nservant, and I went to Krakow to complain to the king; what would the\r\nking tell me? He would say thus: 'I am monarch over all the country, and\r\nyou complain to me about one of your peasants! Do you not have my\r\nofficials in your part of the country; why did you not go to the\r\ncastellan?' So the Lord Jesus is the ruler over the whole universe; but\r\nfor smaller affairs, he employs the saints.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I will tell you what to do,\" said Zbyszko, who entered just now;\r\n\"make a vow to our late queen, that if she intercede for you, you will\r\nmake a pilgrimage to Krakow. Why should you search after strange saints,\r\nwhen we have our own lady, who is better than they?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah! if I only knew that she would intercede for wounds!\"\r\n\r\n\"No matter! There is no saint who would dare to show her an angry face;\r\nor if he dared, Lord God would punish him for it, because she was not an\r\nordinary woman, but a Polish queen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who converted the last heathen country to the Christian faith! That is\r\nright,\" said Macko. \"She must have a high place in God's council and\r\nsurely none would dare to oppose her. Therefore I will do as you say.\"\r\n\r\nThis advice pleased Jagienka, who admired Zbyszko's common sense very\r\nmuch. That same evening, Macko made a vow and drank with still greater\r\nhope, the bear's grease. But after a week, he began to lose hope. He said\r\nthat the grease was fermenting in his stomach, and that a lump was\r\ngrowing on his side near the last rib. At the end of ten days Macko was\r\nworse, and the lump grew larger and became inflamed. The sick man again\r\nhad fever and began to make preparations for death.\r\n\r\nBut one night he awakened Zbyszko, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Light a piece of resinous wood; there is something the matter with me,\r\nbut I do not know what.\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko jumped up and lighted a piece of pine wood.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it! Something has pierced the lump on my side. It must be the\r\nhead of the spear! I had hold of it, but I cannot pull it out.\"\r\n\r\n\"It must be the spearhead! Nothing else. Grasp it well and pull.\"\r\n\r\nMacko began to turn and to twist with pain; but he pushed his fingers\r\ndeeper and deeper, until he seized a hard substance which finally he\r\npulled out.\r\n\r\n\"O, Jesus!\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you pulled it out?\" asked Zbyszko.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I am in a cold perspiration all over; but I have it; look!\"\r\n\r\nHaving said this, he showed to Zbyszko a long splinter, which had\r\nseparated from the spear and remained in his body for several months.\r\n\r\n\"Glory be to God and to Queen Jadwiga! Now you will get well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps; I am better, but it pains me greatly,\" said Macko, pressing the\r\nwound from which blood and pus began to flow. \"Jagienka said that now I\r\nought to dress the wound with the grease of a beaver.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will go to-morrow and get a beaver.\"\r\n\r\nMacko felt considerably better the next day. He slept till morning, and\r\nwhen he awoke, immediately asked for something to eat. He would not even\r\nlook at the bear's grease; but they cooked twenty eggs for him. He ate\r\nthem voraciously, also a big loaf of bread, and drank about four quarts\r\nof beer; then he demanded that they call Zych, because he felt jovial.\r\n\r\nZbyszko sent one of the Turks, given to him by Zawisza, after Zych who\r\nmounted a horse and came in the afternoon when the young people were\r\nready to go to the Odstajny lake to catch a beaver. At first there was\r\nplenty of laughter and singing, while they drank mead; but afterward the\r\nold _wlodykas_ began to talk about the children, each praising his own.\r\n\r\n\"What a man Zbyszko is!\" said Macko; \"there is no other like him in the\r\nworld. He is brave and as agile as a wild-cat. Do you know that when they\r\nconducted him to the scaffold in Krakow, all the girls standing at the\r\nwindows were crying, and such girls;--daughters of knights and of\r\ncastellans, and also the beautiful townswomen.\"\r\n\r\n\"They may be beautiful and the daughters of castellans, but they are not\r\nbetter than my Jagienka!\" answered Zych of Zgorzelice.\r\n\r\n\"Did I say they were better? It will be difficult to find a better girl\r\nthan Jagienka.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not say anything against Zbyszko either; he can stretch a crossbow\r\nwithout a crank.\"\r\n\r\n\"He can underprop a bear also. Did you see how he cut the bear? He cut\r\nthe head and one paw off.\"\r\n\r\n\"He cut the head off, but he did not underprop it alone. Jagienka helped\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did she? He did not tell me about that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Because he promised her not to tell anyone. The girl was ashamed because\r\nshe went into the forest alone at night. She told me all about it; she\r\nnever hides the truth. Frankly speaking, I was not pleased because who\r\nknows what might have happened. I wanted to scold her, but she said, 'If\r\nI be not able to preserve my wreath myself, how can you preserve it, you\r\n_tatulu_; but do not fear, Zbyszko knows what knightly honor is.'\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true. They have gone alone to-day also.\"\r\n\r\n\"They will be back in the evening. But during the night, the devil is\r\nworse and the girl does not feel ashamed because of the darkness.\"\r\n\r\nMacko thought for a while; then he said as if to himself:\r\n\r\n\"But they are fond of each other.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah! it is a pity he made a vow to another!\"\r\n\r\n\"That is, as you know, a knightly custom. They consider the one who has\r\nno lady, a churl. He also made a vow to capture some peacocks' tufts, and\r\nthose he must get because he swore by his knightly honor; he must also\r\nchallenge Lichtenstein; but from the other vows, the abbot can release\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"The abbot is coming soon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you expect him?\" asked Macko; then he said again: \"And what does such\r\na vow amount to; Jurand told him positively that he could not give the\r\ngirl to him! I do not know whether he had promised her to some one else,\r\nor whether he had destined her for God.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have I told you that the abbot loves Jagienka as much as if she were his\r\nown? The last time I saw him he said: 'I have no relations except those\r\nfrom my mother's side; and they will receive nothing from me.'\"\r\n\r\nHere Macko looked at Zych suspiciously and after awhile he answered:\r\n\r\n\"Would you wrong us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Jagienka will get Moczydoly,\" said Zych evasively.\r\n\r\n\"Immediately?\"\r\n\r\n\"Immediately. I would not give it to another; but I will do it for her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Half of Bogdaniec belongs to Zbyszko, and if God restore my health, I\r\nwill improve the estate. Do you love Zbyszko?\"\r\n\r\nZych began to wink and said:\r\n\r\n\"When anybody mentions Zbyszko's name in the presence of Jagienka, she\r\nimmediately turns away.\"\r\n\r\n\"And when you mention another?\"\r\n\r\n\"When I mention another, she only laughs and says: 'What then?'\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, do you not see. God will help us and Zbyszko will forget about the\r\nother girl. I am old and I will forget also. Will you have some more\r\nmead?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I will.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, the abbot is a wise man! You know that some of the abbots are\r\nlaymen; but this abbot, although he does not sit among the friars, is a\r\npriest just the same; and a priest can always give better advice than an\r\nordinary man, because he knows how to read, and he communes with the Holy\r\nGhost. I am glad that Jagienka is going to have the estate of Moczydoly.\r\nAs for me, as soon as the Lord Jesus restores my health, I will try to\r\ninduce some of the peasants living on the estate of Wilk of Brzozowa, to\r\nsettle on my land. I will offer them more land, I have plenty of it in\r\nBogdaniec. They can come if they wish to, for they are free. In time, I\r\nwill build a _grodek_ in Bogdaniec, a worthy castle of oaks with a ditch\r\naround it. Let Zbyszko and Jagienka hunt together. I think we shall soon\r\nhave snow. They will become accustomed to each other, and the boy will\r\nforget that other girl. Let them be together. Speak frankly; would you\r\ngive Jagienka to him or not?\"\r\n\r\n\"I would. Did we not decide a long time ago that they should marry, and\r\nthat Moczydoly and Bogdaniec would be our grandchildren's?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Grady!_\" exclaimed Macko, joyfully. \"God will bless us and their\r\nchildren will be as numerous as hail. The abbot shall baptize them.\"\r\n\r\n\"If he will only be quick enough!\" exclaimed Zych. \"I have not seen you\r\nso jolly as you are to-day for a long time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I am glad in my heart. Do not fear about Zbyszko. Yesterday when\r\nJagienka mounted her horse, the wind blew. I asked Zbyszko then: 'Did you\r\nsee?' and his eyes shone. I have also noticed that although at first they\r\ndid not speak much to each other, now when they go together, they are\r\ncontinually turning their heads toward each other, and they talk--talk!\r\nHave some more mead?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I will.\"\r\n\r\n\"To Zbyszko and Jagienka's health!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nThe old _wlodyka_ was not mistaken when he said that Zbyszko and Jagienka\r\nwere fond of each other, and even that they longed for each other.\r\nJagienka pretending that she wanted to visit the sick Macko, went very\r\noften to Bogdaniec, either alone or with her father. Zbyszko also went\r\noften to Zgorzelice. In that way, after a few days a familiarity and\r\nfriendship originated between them. They grew fond of each other and\r\ntalked about everything that interested them. There was much mutual\r\nadmiration in that friendship also. The young and handsome Zbyszko, who\r\nhad already distinguished himself in the war, had participated in\r\ntournaments and had been in the presence of kings, was considered by the\r\ngirl, when she compared him with Cztan of Rogow or Wilk of Brzozowa, a\r\ntrue courtly knight and almost a prince; as for him, he was astonished at\r\nthe great beauty of the girl. He was loyal to Danusia; but very often\r\nwhen he looked suddenly at Jagienka, either in the forest or at home, he\r\nsaid involuntarily to himself: \"Hej! what a girl!\" When, helping her to\r\nmount her horse, he felt her elastic flesh under his hands, disquietude\r\nfilled him and he shivered, and a torpor began to steal over him.\r\n\r\nJagienka, although naturally proud, inclined to raillery, and even\r\naggressive, grew more and more gentle with him, often looking in his eyes\r\nto discover how she could please him; he understood her affection; he was\r\ngrateful for it and he liked to be with her more and more. Finally,\r\nespecially after Macko began to drink the bear's grease, they saw each\r\nother almost every day; when the splinter came out of the wound, they\r\nwent together to get some fresh beaver's grease, necessary for the\r\nhealing of the wound.\r\n\r\nThey took their crossbows, mounted their horses and went first to\r\nMoczydoly, destined for Jagienka's dowry, then to the edge of the forest,\r\nwhere they entrusted the horses to a servant and went on foot, because it\r\nwas impossible to pass through the thicket on horseback. While walking,\r\nJagienka pointed to the large meadow covered with reeds and to the blue\r\nribbon of forest and said:\r\n\r\n\"Those woods belong to Cztan of Rogow.\"\r\n\r\n\"The same man who would like to take you?\"\r\n\r\nShe began to laugh:\r\n\r\n\"He would if he could!\"\r\n\r\n\"You can defend yourself very easily, having for your defence the\r\nWilk[82] who, as I understand, gnashes his teeth at Cztan. I wonder that\r\nthey have not challenged each other to fight until death.\"\r\n\r\n\"They have not because _tatulo_ before he went to the war said to them:\r\n'If you fight about Jagienka I do not want to see you any more.' How\r\ncould they fight then? When they are in Zgorzelice they scowl at each\r\nother; but afterward they drink together in an inn in Krzesnia until they\r\nare drunk.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stupid boys!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because while Zych was away one of them should have taken you by force.\r\nWhat could Zych do, if when he returned he had found you with a baby on\r\nyour lap?\"\r\n\r\nAt this Jagienka's blue eyes flashed immediately.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think I would let them take me? Have we not people in Zgorzelice,\r\nand do I not know how to manage a crossbow or a boar-spear? Let them try!\r\nI would chase them back home and even attack them in Rogow or Brzozowa.\r\nFather knew very well that he could go to the war and leave me home\r\nalone.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking thus, she frowned, and shook the crossbow threateningly, so that\r\nZbyszko began to laugh, and said:\r\n\r\n\"You ought to have been a knight and not a girl.\"\r\n\r\nShe becoming calmer, answered:\r\n\r\n\"Cztan guarded me from Wilk and Wilk from Cztan. Then I was also under\r\nthe abbot's tutelage, and it is well for everyone to let the abbot\r\nalone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Owa!\" answered Zbyszko. \"They are all afraid of the abbot! But I, may\r\nSaint George help me to speak the truth to you, I would neither be afraid\r\nof the abbot, nor of your peasants, nor of yourself; I would take you!\"\r\n\r\nAt this Jagienka stopped on the spot, and fixing her eyes on Zbyszko,\r\nasked in a strange, soft, low voice:\r\n\r\n\"You would take me?\"\r\n\r\nThen her lips parted and blushing like the dawn, she waited for his\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nBut he evidently was only thinking what he would do, were he in Cztan or\r\nWilk's position; because after a while, he shook his golden hair and said\r\nfurther:\r\n\r\n\"A girl must marry and not fight with the boys. Unless you have a third\r\none, you must choose one of these two.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must not tell me that,\" answered the girl, sadly.\r\n\r\n\"Why not? I have been away from home for a long time, therefore I do not\r\nknow whether there is somebody around Zgorzelice, of whom you are fond or\r\nnot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hej!\" answered Jagienka. \"Let it be!\"\r\n\r\nThey walked along silently, trying to make their way through the thicket\r\nwhich was now much denser because the bushes and the trees were covered\r\nwith wild hop vines. Zbyszko walked first, tearing down the green vines,\r\nand breaking the branches here and there; Jagienka followed him with a\r\ncrossbow on her shoulder, looking like a hunting goddess.\r\n\r\n\"Beyond that thicket,\" said she, \"there is a deep brook; but I know where\r\nthe ford is.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have long boots on, reaching above my knees; we can cross it,\"\r\nanswered Zbyszko.\r\n\r\nShortly afterward, they reached the brook. Jagienka being familiar with\r\nthe Moczydlowski forests, very easily found the ford; but the water was\r\ndeeper than usual, the little brook being swollen by the rains. Then\r\nZbyszko without asking her permission, seized the girl in his arms.\r\n\r\n\"I can cross by myself,\" said Jagienka.\r\n\r\n\"Put your arms around my neck!\" answered Zbyszko.\r\n\r\nHe walked slowly through the water, while the girl nestled to him.\r\nFinally when they were near the other shore, she said:\r\n\r\n\"Zbyszku!\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"I care neither for Cztan, nor for Wilk.\"\r\n\r\nAs he placed her on the shore, he answered excitedly:\r\n\r\n\"May God give you the best I He will not be wronged.\"\r\n\r\nThe Odstajny lake was not far away now. Jagienka walking in front, turned\r\nfrom time to time, and putting a finger on her lips, ordered Zbyszko to\r\nbe silent. They were walking amidst the osiers and gray willows, on low,\r\ndamp ground. From the left side, were heard the voices of birds, and\r\nZbyszko was surprised at that, because it was time for the birds to\r\nmigrate.\r\n\r\n\"We are near a morass which is never frozen,\" whispered Jagienka; \"the\r\nducks pass the winter there; even in the lake the water freezes only near\r\nthe shores. See how it is steaming.\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko looked through the willows and noticed in front of him, something\r\nlike a bank of fog; it was the Odstajny lake.\r\n\r\nJagienka again put a finger to her lips, and after a while they reached\r\nthe lake. The girl climbed on an old willow and bent over the water.\r\nZbyszko followed her example; and for a long time they remained quiet,\r\nseeing nothing in front of them, on account of the fog; hearing nothing\r\nbut the mournful puling of lapwings. Finally the wind blew, rustled the\r\nosiers and the yellow leaves of the willows, and disclosed the waters of\r\nthe lake which were slightly ruffled by the wind.\r\n\r\n\"Do you see anything?\" whispered Zbyszko.\r\n\r\n\"No. Keep quiet!\"\r\n\r\nAfter a while, the wind ceased and complete silence followed. Then on the\r\nsurface of the lake appeared one head, then another; finally near them a\r\nbig beaver entered the water from the shore, carrying in his mouth a\r\nnewly cut branch, and began to swim amidst the duck-weed and marigold\r\nholding his mouth out of the water and pushing the branch before him.\r\nZbyszko lying on the trunk beneath Jagienka, noticed that her elbow moved\r\nquietly and that her head was bent forward; evidently she had aimed at\r\nthe animal which, not suspecting any danger, was swimming close by,\r\ntoward the clear water.\r\n\r\nFinally the string of the crossbow twanged and at the same moment\r\nJagienka cried:\r\n\r\n\"I hit him! I hit him!\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko instantly climbed higher and looked through the thicket toward\r\nthe water; the beaver plunged into the water, then reappeared on the\r\nsurface, turning somersets.\r\n\r\n\"I hit him hard! He will soon be quiet!\" said Jagienka.\r\n\r\nThe movements of the animal grew slower, and then before one had time\r\nsufficient to recite one \"_Ave Maria_,\" he was floating on his back on\r\nthe surface of the water.\r\n\r\n\"I will go and get him,\" said Zbyszko.\r\n\r\n\"No, do not go. Here, near the shore, there is, deep slime. Anyone who\r\ndoes not know how to manage, will surely drown.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then how will we get him?\"\r\n\r\n\"He will be in Bogdaniec this evening, do not worry about that; now we\r\nmust go home.\"\r\n\r\n\"You hit him hard!\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah! It is not the first one!\"\r\n\r\n\"Other girls are afraid to even look at a crossbow; but with you, one can\r\ngo to the forest all his life.\"\r\n\r\nJagienka smiled at such praise, but she did not answer; they returned the\r\nsame way they came. Zbyszko asked her about the beavers and she told him\r\nhow many of them there were in Moczydoly, and how many in Zgorzelice.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she struck her hip with her hand and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Well, I left my arrows on the willow. Wait!\"\r\n\r\nBefore he could say that he would return for them, she jumped back like a\r\nroe and disappeared. Zbyszko waited and waited; at last he began to\r\nwonder what detained her so long.\r\n\r\n\"She must have lost the arrows and is searching for them,\" he said to\r\nhimself; \"but I will go and see whether anything has happened to her.\"\r\n\r\nHe had hardly started to return before the girl appeared with her bow in\r\nher hand, her face smiling and blushing, and with the beaver on her\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\n\"For God's sake!\" cried Zbyszko, \"how did you get him?\"\r\n\r\n\"How? I went into the water, that is all! It is nothing new for me; but I\r\ndid not want you to go, because the mud drags anyone down who does not\r\nknow how to swim in it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I waited here like a fool! You are a sly girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, could I undress before you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah! If I had followed you, then I would have seen a wonder!\"\r\n\r\n\"Be silent!\"\r\n\r\n\"I was just starting, so help me God!\"\r\n\r\n\"Be silent!\"\r\n\r\nAfter a while, wishing to turn the conversation, she said:\r\n\r\n\"Wring my tress; it makes my back wet.\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko caught the tress in one hand and began to wring with the other,\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\n\"The best way will be to unbraid it, then the wind will soon dry it.\"\r\n\r\nBut she did not wish to do that on account of the thicket through which\r\nthey were obliged to make their way. Zbyszko now put the beaver on his\r\nshoulders. Jagienka walking in front of him, said:\r\n\r\n\"Now Macko will soon be well, because there is no better medicine for a\r\nwound than the grease of a bear inside, and the grease of a beaver\r\noutside. In about two weeks, he will be able to ride a horse.\"\r\n\r\n\"May God grant that!\" answered Zbyszko. \"I am waiting for it as for\r\nsalvation, because I cannot leave the sick man, and it is hard for me to\r\nstay here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why is it hard for you to stay here?\" she asked him.\r\n\r\n\"Has Zych told you nothing about Danusia?\"\r\n\r\n\"He did tell me something. I know that she covered you with her veil. I\r\nknow that! He told me also that every knight makes some vow, to serve his\r\nlady. But he said that such a vow did not amount to anything; that some\r\nof the knights were married, but they served their ladies just the same.\r\nBut Danusia, Zbyszko; tell me about her!\"\r\n\r\nHaving come very close to him, she began to look at his face with great\r\nanxiety; he did not pay any attention to her frightened voice and looks,\r\nbut said:\r\n\r\n\"She is my lady, and at the same time she is my sweetest love. I have not\r\nspoken about her to anybody; but I am going to tell you, because we have\r\nbeen acquainted since we were children. I will follow her beyond the\r\ntenth river and beyond the tenth sea, to the Germans and to the Tartars,\r\nbecause there is no other girl like her. Let my uncle remain in\r\nBogdaniec, and I will go to her. What do I care about Bogdaniec, the\r\nhousehold, the herds, or the abbot's wealth, without her! I will mount my\r\nhorse and I will go, so help me God; I will fulfill that which I promised\r\nher, or I will die.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not know,\" answered Jagienka, in a hollow voice.\r\n\r\nZbyszko began to tell her about all that had happened; how he had met\r\nDanusia in Tyniec; how he had made a vow to her; about everything that\r\nhappened afterward; about his imprisonment, and how Danusia rescued him;\r\nabout Jurand's refusal, their farewell and his loneliness; finally about\r\nhis joy, because as soon as Macko became well, he would go to his beloved\r\ngirl. His story was interrupted at last by the sight of the servant with\r\nthe horses, waiting on the edge of the forest.\r\n\r\nJagienka immediately mounted her horse and began to bid Zbyszko good-bye.\r\n\r\n\"Let the servant follow you with the beaver; I am going to Zgorzelice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you will not go to Bogdaniec? Zych is there.\"\r\n\r\n\"No. _Tatulo_ said he would return and told me to go home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, may God reward you for the beaver.\"\r\n\r\n\"With God.\"\r\n\r\nThen Jagienka was alone. Going home through the heaths, she looked back\r\nfor a while after Zbyszko; when he disappeared beyond the trees, she\r\ncovered her eyes with her hands as if sheltering them from the sunlight.\r\nBut soon large tears began to flow down her cheeks and drop one after\r\nanother on the horse's mane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nAfter the conversation with Zbyszko, Jagienka did not appear in Bogdaniec\r\nfor three days; but on the third day she hurried in with the news that\r\nthe abbot had arrived at Zgorzelice. Macko received the news with\r\nemotion. It is true he had money enough to pay the amount for which the\r\nestate was pledged, and he calculated that he would have enough to induce\r\nsettlers to come, to buy herds and to make other improvements; but in the\r\nwhole transaction, much depended on the disposition of the rich relation,\r\nwho, for instance, could take or leave the peasants settled by him on the\r\nland, and in that way increase or diminish the value of the estate.\r\n\r\nTherefore Macko asked Jagienka about the abbot; how he was; if he was in\r\na good humor or gloomy; what he had said about them; when he was coming\r\nto Bogdaniec? She gave him sensible answers, trying to encourage and\r\ntranquillize him in every respect.\r\n\r\nShe said that the abbot was in good health and gay; that he was\r\naccompanied by a considerable retinue in which, besides the armed\r\nservants, there were several seminarists and _rybalts_; that he sang with\r\nZych and that he listened gladly not only to the spiritual but to the\r\nworldly songs also. She had noticed also that he asked carefully about\r\nMacko, and that he listened eagerly to Zych's narration of Zbyszko's\r\nadventure in Krakow.\r\n\r\n\"You know best what you ought to do,\" finally the clever girl said; \"but\r\nI think that Zbyszko ought to go immediately and greet his elder\r\nrelative, and not wait until the abbot comes to Bogdaniec.\"\r\n\r\nMacko liked the advice; therefore he called Zbyszko and said to him:\r\n\r\n\"Dress yourself beautifully; then go and bow to the abbot, and pay him\r\nrespect; perhaps he will take a fancy to you.\"\r\n\r\nThen he turned to Jagienka:\r\n\r\n\"I would not be surprised if you were stupid, because you are a woman;\r\nbut I am astonished to find that you have such good sense. Tell me then,\r\nthe best way to receive the abbot when he comes here.\"\r\n\r\n\"As for food, he will tell you himself what he wishes to have; he likes\r\nto feast well, but if there be a great deal of saffron in the food, he\r\nwill eat anything.\"\r\n\r\nMacko hearing this, said:\r\n\r\n\"How can I get saffron for him!\"\r\n\r\n\"I brought some,\" said Jagienka.\r\n\r\n\"Give us more such girls!\" exclaimed the overjoyed Macko. \"She is pretty,\r\na good housekeeper, intelligent and good-hearted! Hej! if I were only\r\nyounger I would take her immediately!\"\r\n\r\nHere Jagienka glanced at Zbyszko, and having sighed slightly, she said\r\nfurther:\r\n\r\n\"I brought also the dice, the goblet and the cloth, because after his\r\nmeal, the abbot likes to play dice.\"\r\n\r\n\"He had the same habit formerly, and he used to get very angry.\"\r\n\r\n\"He gets angry sometimes now; then he throws the goblet on the ground and\r\nrushes from the room into the fields. Then he comes back smiling, and\r\nlaughs at his anger. You know him! If one does not contradict him, you\r\ncannot find a better man in the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who would contradict him; is he not wiser and mightier than others?\"\r\n\r\nThus they talked while Zbyszko was dressing in the alcove. Finally he\r\ncame out, looking so beautiful that he dazzled Jagienka, as much as he\r\ndid the first time he went to Zgorzelice in his white _jaka_. She\r\nregretted that this handsome knight was not hers, and that he was in love\r\nwith another girl.\r\n\r\nMacko was pleased because he thought that the abbot could not help liking\r\nZbyszko and would be more lenient during their business transaction. He\r\nwas so much pleased with this idea, that he determined to go also.\r\n\r\n\"Order the servants to prepare a wagon,\" said he to Zbyszko. \"If I could\r\ntravel from Krakow to Bogdaniec with an iron in my side, surely I can go\r\nnow to Zgorzelice.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you only will not faint,\" said Jagienka.\r\n\r\n\"Ej! I will be all right, because I feel stronger already. And even if I\r\nfaint, the abbot will see that I hastened to meet him, and will be more\r\ngenerous.\"\r\n\r\n\"I prefer your health to his generosity!\" said Zbyszko.\r\n\r\nBut Macko was persistent and started for Zgorzelice. On the road he\r\nmoaned a little, but he continued to give Zbyszko advice; he told him how\r\nto act in Zgorzelice, and especially recommended him to be obedient and\r\nhumble in the presence of their mighty relative, who never would suffer\r\nthe slightest opposition.\r\n\r\nWhen they came to Zgorzelice, they found Zych and the abbot sitting in\r\nfront of the house, looking at the beautiful country, and drinking wine.\r\nBehind them, near the wall, sat six men of the abbot's retinue; two of\r\nthem were _rybalts_; one was a pilgrim, who could easily be distinguished\r\nby his curved stick and dark mantle; the others looked like seminarists\r\nbecause their heads were shaved, but they wore lay clothing, girdles of\r\nox leather, and swords.\r\n\r\nWhen Zych perceived Macko coming in the wagon, he rushed toward him; but\r\nthe abbot, evidently remembering his spiritual dignity, remained seated,\r\nand began to say something to his seminarists. Zbyszko and Zych conducted\r\nthe sick Macko toward the house.\r\n\r\n\"I am not well yet,\" said Macko, kissing the abbot's hand, \"but I came to\r\nbow to you, my benefactor; to thank you for your care of Bogdaniec, and\r\nto beg you for a benediction, which is most necessary for a sinful man.\"\r\n\r\n\"I heard you were better,\" said the abbot, placing his hand on Macko's\r\nhead; \"and that you had promised to go to the grave of our late queen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not knowing which saint's protection to ask for, I made a vow to her.\"\r\n\r\n\"You did well!\" said the abbot, enthusiastically; \"she is better than all\r\nthe others, if one only dare beseech her!\"\r\n\r\nIn a moment his face became flushed with anger, his cheeks filled with\r\nblood, his eyes began to sparkle.\r\n\r\nThey were so used to his impetuosity, that Zych began to laugh and\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Strike, who believes in God!\"\r\n\r\nAs for the abbot, he puffed loudly, and looked at those present; then\r\nlaughed suddenly, and having looked at Zbyszko, he asked:\r\n\r\n\"Is that your nephew and my relation?\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko bent and kissed his hand.\r\n\r\n\"I saw him when he was a small boy; I did not recognize him,\" said the\r\nabbot. \"Show yourself!\" And he began to look at him from head to foot,\r\nand finally said:\r\n\r\n\"He is too handsome! It is a girl, not a knight!\"\r\n\r\n\"To this Macko replied:\r\n\r\n\"That girl used to go to dancing parties with the Germans; but those who\r\ntook her, fell down and did not rise again.\"\r\n\r\n\"And he can stretch a crossbow without a crank!\" exclaimed Jagienka.\r\n\r\nThe abbot turned toward her:\r\n\r\n\"Ah! Are you here?\"\r\n\r\nShe blushed so much that her neck and ears became red, and answered:\r\n\r\n\"I saw him do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look out then, that he does not shoot you, because you will be obliged\r\nto nurse yourself for a long time.\"\r\n\r\nAt this the _rybalts_, the pilgrim and the seminarists broke out with\r\ngreat laughter, which confused Jagienka still more; the abbot took pity\r\non her, and having raised his arm, he showed her his enormous sleeve, and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Hide here, my dear girl!\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Zych assisted Macko to the bench and ordered some wine for him.\r\nJagienka went to get it. The abbot turned to Zbyszko and began to talk\r\nthus:\r\n\r\n\"Enough of joking! I compared you to a girl, not to humiliate you, but to\r\npraise your beauty, of which many girls would be proud. But I know that\r\nyou are a man! I have heard about your deeds at Wilno, about the Fryzes,\r\nand about Krakow. Zych has told me all about it, understand!\"\r\n\r\nHere he began to look intently into Zbyszko's eyes, and after a while he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"If you have promised three peacocks' tufts, then search for them! It is\r\npraiseworthy and pleasing to God to persecute the foes of our nation.\r\nBut, if you have promised something else, I will release you from the\r\nvow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hej!\" said Zbyszko; \"when a man promises something in his soul to the\r\nLord Jesus, who has the power to release him?\"\r\n\r\nMacko looked with fear at the abbot; but evidently he was in an excellent\r\nhumor, because instead of becoming angry, he threatened Zbyszko with his\r\nfinger and said:\r\n\r\n\"How clever you are! But you must be careful that you do not meet the\r\nsame fate that the German, Beyhard, did.\"\r\n\r\n\"What happened to him?\" asked Zych.\r\n\r\n\"They burned him on a pile.\"\r\n\r\n\"What for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because he used to say that a layman could understand God's secrets as\r\nwell as the clergy.\"\r\n\r\n\"They punished him severely!\"\r\n\r\n\"But righteously!\" shouted the abbot, \"because he had blasphemed against\r\nthe Holy Ghost. What do you think? Is a layman able to interpret any of\r\nGod's secrets?\"\r\n\r\n\"He cannot by any means!\" exclaimed the wandering seminarists, together.\r\n\r\n\"Keep quiet, you _shpilmen_!\" said the abbot; \"you are not ecclesiastics,\r\nalthough your heads are shaved.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are not '_shpilmen_,' but courtiers of Your Grace,\" answered one of\r\nthem, looking toward a large bucket from which the smell of hops and malt\r\nwas filling the air.\r\n\r\n\"Look! He is talking from a barrel!\" exclaimed the abbot. \"Hej, you\r\nshaggy one! Why do you look at the bucket? You will not find any Latin at\r\nthe bottom of that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not looking for Latin, but for beer; but I cannot find any.\"\r\n\r\nThe abbot turned toward Zbyszko, who was looking with astonishment at\r\nsuch courtiers as these, and said:\r\n\r\n\"They are _clerici scholares_;[83] but every one of them prefers to throw\r\nhis books aside, and taking his lute, wander through the world. I shelter\r\nand nourish them; what else can I do? They are good for nothing, but they\r\nknow how to sing and they are familiar with God's service; therefore I\r\nhave some benefit out of them in my church, and in case of need, they\r\nwill defend me, because some of them are fierce fellows! This pilgrim\r\nsays that he was in the Holy Land; but I have asked him in vain about\r\nsome of the seas and countries; he does not know even the name of the\r\nGreek emperor nor in what city he lives.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did know,\" said the pilgrim, in a hoarse voice; \"but the fever I\r\ncaught at the Danube, shook everything out of me.\"\r\n\r\n\"What surprises me most is, that they wear swords, being wandering\r\nseminarists,\" said Zbyszko.\r\n\r\n\"They are allowed to wear them,\" said the abbot, \"because they have not\r\nreceived orders yet; and there is no occasion for anyone to wonder\r\nbecause I wear a sword even though I am an abbot. A year ago I challenged\r\nWilk of Brzozowa to fight for the forests which you passed; but he did\r\nnot appear.\"\r\n\r\n\"How could he fight with one of the clergy?\" interrupted Zych.\r\n\r\nAt this the abbot became angry, struck the table with his fist, and\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"When I wear armor, then I am not a priest, but a nobleman! He did not\r\ncome because he preferred to have his servants attack me in Tulcza. That\r\nis why I wear a sword: _Omnes leges, omniaque iura vim vi repellere\r\ncunctisque sese defensare permittunt!_ That is why I gave them their\r\nswords.\"\r\n\r\nHearing the Latin, Zych, Macko and Zbyszko became silent and bent their\r\nheads before the abbot's wisdom, because they did not understand a word\r\nof it; as for the abbot, he looked very angry for a while, and then he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Who knows but what he will attack me even here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Owa! Let him come!\" exclaimed the wandering seminarists, seizing the\r\nhilts of their swords.\r\n\r\n\"I would like to have him attack me! I am longing for a fight.\"\r\n\r\n\"He will not do that,\" said Zych. \"It is more likely that he will come to\r\nbow to you. He gave up the forests, and now he is anxious about his son.\r\nYou know! But he can wait a long time!\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the abbot became quieted and said:\r\n\r\n\"I saw young Wilk drinking with Cztan of Rogow in an inn in Krzesnia.\r\nThey did not recognize us at once, because it was dark; they were talking\r\nabout Jagienka.\"\r\n\r\nHere he turned to Zbyszko:\r\n\r\n\"And about you, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do they want from me?\"\r\n\r\n\"They do not want anything from you; but they do not like it that there\r\nis a third young man near Zgorzelice. Cztan said to Wilk: 'After I tan\r\nhis skin, he will not be so smooth.' And Wilk said: 'Perhaps he will be\r\nafraid of us; if not, I will break his bones!' Then they assured each\r\nother that you would be afraid of them.\"\r\n\r\nHearing this Macko looked at Zych, and Zych looked at him; their faces\r\nexpressed great cunning and joy. Neither of them was sure whether the\r\nabbot had really heard such a conversation, or whether he was only saying\r\nthis to excite Zbyszko; but they both knew, and Macko especially, that\r\nthere was no better way to incite Zbyszko to try to win Jagienka.\r\n\r\nThe abbot added deliberately:\r\n\r\n\"It is true, they are fierce fellows!\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko did not show any excitement; but he asked in a strange tone that\r\ndid not sound like his voice:\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow is Sunday?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Sunday.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will go to church?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes!\"\r\n\r\n\"Where? to Krzesnia?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is the nearest!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, all right then!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nZybszko, having joined Zych and Jagienka, who were accompanying the abbot\r\nand his retinue to Krzesnia, rode with them, because he wanted to show\r\nthe abbot that he was afraid neither of Wilk of Brzozowa, nor of Cztan of\r\nRogow. He was again surprised at Jagienka's beauty. He had often seen her\r\nin Zgorzelice and Bogdaniec, dressed beautifully; but never had she\r\nlooked as she did now when going to church. Her cloak was made of red\r\nbroadcloth, lined with ermine; she wore red gloves, and on her head was a\r\nlittle hood embroidered with gold, from beneath which two braids fell\r\ndown on her shoulders. She was not sitting on the horse astride, but on a\r\nhigh saddle which had an arm and a little bench for her feet, which\r\nscarcely showed from beneath her long skirt. Zych permitted the girl to\r\ndress in a sheepskin overcoat and high-legged boots when at home, but\r\nrequired that for church she should be dressed not like the daughter of a\r\npoor _wlodyczka_,[84] but like the _panna_ of a mighty nobleman. Two\r\nboys, dressed like pages, conducted her horse. Four servants were riding\r\nbehind with the abbot's seminarists, who were armed with swords and\r\ncarried their lutes. Zbyszko admired all the retinue, but especially\r\nJagienka, who looked like a picture. The abbot, who was dressed in a red\r\ncloak, having enormous sleeves, resembled a traveling prince. The most\r\nmodest dress was worn by Zych, who requiring magnificent display for the\r\nothers, for himself cared only for singing and joy.\r\n\r\nZych, Zbyszko, Jagienka and the abbot rode together. At first the abbot\r\nordered his _shpilmen_ to sing some church songs; afterward, when he was\r\ntired of their songs, he began to talk with Zbyszko, who smiled at his\r\nenormous sword, which was as large as a two-handed German sword.\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" said he gravely, \"that you wonder at my sword; the synod permits\r\na clergyman to wear a sword during a journey, and I am traveling. When\r\nthe holy father forbade the ecclesiastics to wear swords and red dresses,\r\nmost assuredly he meant the men of low birth, because God intended that\r\nnoblemen should wear arms; and he who would dare to take this right from\r\na nobleman, would oppose His eternal will.\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw the Mazovian Prince Henryk, when he fought in the lists,\" said\r\nZbyszko.\r\n\r\n\"We do not censure him, because he fought,\" answered the abbot, raising\r\nhis finger, \"but because he married and married unhappily; _fornicarium_\r\nand _bibulam_ had taken _mulierem_, whom _Bachum_ since she was young\r\n_adorabat_, and besides that she was _adultera_, from whom no one could\r\nexpect any good.\" He stopped his horse and began to expound with still\r\ngreater gravity:\r\n\r\n\"Whoever wishes to marry, or to choose _uxorem_ must ascertain if she is\r\npious, moral, a good housekeeper and cleanly. This is recommended not\r\nonly by the fathers of the church, but also by a certain pagan sage,\r\ncalled Seneca. And how can you know whether you have chosen well, if you\r\ndo not know the nest from which you take your life companion? Because\r\nanother sage has said: _Pomus nam cadit absque arbore._ As is the ox, so\r\nis the skin; as is the mother, so is the girl. Prom which you, a sinner,\r\nmust draw this moral,--that you must look for your wife not far away, but\r\nnear; because if you get a bad one, you will cry as did the philosopher,\r\nwhen his quarrelsome wife poured _aquam sordidam_ on his head.\"\r\n\r\n\"_In saecula saeculorum_, amen!\" exclaimed in unison the wandering\r\nseminarists, who when responding to the abbot, did not always answer\r\nproperly.\r\n\r\nThey were all listening very attentively to the abbot's words, admiring\r\nhis eloquence and his knowledge of the Scriptures; he apparently did not\r\nspeak directly to Zbyszko; but on the contrary, he turned more toward\r\nZych and Jagienka, as if he wished to edify them. But evidently Jagienka\r\nunderstood what he was trying to do, because from beneath her long\r\neyelashes, she looked at Zbyszko, who frowned and dropped his head as if\r\nhe were seriously thinking about what the abbot had said.\r\n\r\nAfter this the retinue moved on silently; but when they came near\r\nKrzesnia, the abbot touched his girdle and then turned it so that he\r\ncould seize the hilt of his sword more easily, and said:\r\n\r\n\"I am sure that old Wilk of Brzozowa will come with a good retinue.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" replied Zych, \"but I heard that he was not well.\"\r\n\r\n\"One of my seminarists heard that he intends to attack us in front of the\r\ninn after the service is over.\"\r\n\r\n\"He will not do that without a challenge, and especially after holy\r\nmass.\"\r\n\r\n\"May God, bring him to reason. I do not seek a quarrel with anybody and I\r\nbear my wrongs patiently.\"\r\n\r\nHere he looked at the _shpilmen_, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Do not draw your swords, and remember that you are spiritual servants;\r\nbut if they attack us first, then strike them!\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko, while riding beside Jagienka, said to her:\r\n\r\n\"I am sure that in Krzesnia we will meet young Wilk and Cztan. Show me\r\nthem from afar, so that I may know them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, Zbyszku,\" answered Jagienka.\r\n\r\n\"Do they not meet you before the service and after the service? What do\r\nthey do then?\"\r\n\r\n\"They serve me.\"\r\n\r\n\"They will not serve you now, understand?\" And she answered again, almost\r\nwith humility:\r\n\r\n\"Very well, Zbyszku.\"\r\n\r\nFurther conversation was interrupted by the sound of the wooden knockers,\r\nthere being no bells in Krzesnia. After a few moments they arrived at the\r\nchurch. From the crowd in front, waiting for mass, young Wilk and Cztan\r\nof Rogow came forward immediately; but Zbyszko jumped from his horse, and\r\nbefore they could reach her, seized Jagienka and lifted her down from her\r\nhorse; then he took her by the hand, and looking at them threateningly,\r\nconducted her to the church.\r\n\r\nIn the vestibule of the church, they were again disappointed. Both rushed\r\nto the font of holy water, plunged their hands in, and then stretched\r\nthem toward the girl. But Zbyszko did the same, and she touched his\r\nfingers; then having made the sign of the cross, she entered the church\r\nwith him. Then not only young Wilk, but Cztan of Rogow also,\r\nnotwithstanding his stupidity, understood that this had been done\r\npurposely, and both were very angry. Wilk rushed out of the vestibule and\r\nran like a madman, not knowing where he was going. Cztan rushed after\r\nhim, although not knowing why.\r\n\r\nThey stopped at the corner of the inclosure where there were some large\r\nstones ready for the foundation of the tower which was to be built in\r\nKrzesnia. Then, Wilk wishing to assuage the wrath which raged in his\r\nbreast, seized one of these stones, and began to shake it; Cztan seeing\r\nhim do this, seized it also, and both began to roll it toward the church\r\ngate.\r\n\r\nThe people looked at them with amazement, thinking that they had made\r\nsome vow, and that in this way they wished to contribute to the building\r\nof the tower. This effort gave them relief and they came to their senses;\r\nthen they stood, pale from their exertion, puffing and looking at each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nCztan of Rogow was the first to break the silence.\r\n\r\n\"What now?\" asked he.\r\n\r\n\"What?\" answered Wilk.\r\n\r\n\"Shall we attack him immediately?\"\r\n\r\n\"How can we do that in the church?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not in the church, but after mass.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is with Zych and the abbot. And have you forgotten that Zych said\r\nthat if there were a fight, he would refuse to let either of us visit at\r\nZgorzelice. But for that, I would have broken your ribs long ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or I, yours!\" answered Cztan, clinching his powerful fists.\r\n\r\nAnd their eyes began to sparkle threateningly; but soon they both\r\nrealized that now, more than ever, they needed to have a good\r\nunderstanding. They often fought together; but after each fight, they\r\nalways became reconciled, because although they were divided by their\r\nlove for Jagienka, they could not live without each other. Now they had a\r\ncommon foe and they understood that the enemy was a dangerous one.\r\n\r\nAfter a while Cztan asked:\r\n\r\n\"What shall we do? Shall we send him a challenge?\"\r\n\r\nWilk, although he was wiser, did not know what to do. Fortunately the\r\nknockers resounded to notify the people that mass would begin. When he\r\nheard them he said:\r\n\r\n\"What shall we do? Go to church now and after that, we will do whatever\r\npleases God.\"\r\n\r\nCztan of Rogow was pleased with this answer.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps the Lord Jesus will send us an inspiration,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"And will bless us,\" added Wilk.\r\n\r\n\"According to justice.\"\r\n\r\nThey went to church, and having listened devoutly to the mass, they grew\r\nmore hopeful. They did not lose their temper after mass, when Jagienka\r\nagain accepted holy water from Zbyszko. In the church-yard they bowed to\r\nZych, to Jagienka and even to the abbot, although he was an enemy of Wilk\r\nof Brzozowa. They scowled at Zbyszko, but did not attempt to touch him,\r\nalthough their hearts were throbbing with grief, anger and jealousy;\r\nnever before had Jagienka seemed to them to be as beautiful as she was\r\nthen. When the brilliant retinue moved on and when from afar they heard\r\nthe merry song of the ambulant seminarists, Cztan began to wipe the\r\nperspiration from his hairy cheeks and to snort like a horse; as for\r\nWilk, he said, gnashing his teeth:\r\n\r\n\"To the inn! To the inn! Woe to me!\" Afterward remembering what had\r\nrelieved them before, they again seized the stone and rolled it back to\r\nits former place.\r\n\r\nZbyszko rode beside Jagienka, listening to the abbot's _shpilmen_ singing\r\nmerry songs; but when they had traveled five or six furlongs, he suddenly\r\nreined in his horse, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Oh! I intended to pay for a mass to be said for uncle's health and I\r\nforgot it; I must return.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not go back!\" exclaimed Jagienka; \"we will send from Zgorzelice.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I will return, and you must not wait for me. With God!\"\r\n\r\n\"With God,\" said the abbot. \"Go!\" And his face brightened; when Zbyszko\r\ndisappeared, he touched Zych with his elbow and said:\r\n\r\n\"Do you understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"He will surely fight in Krzesnia with Wilk and Cztan; but I wished for\r\nit and I am glad.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are dreadful boys! If they wound him, then what of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"What of it? If he fight for Jagienka, then how can he afterward think\r\nabout that other girl, Jurandowna? From this time, Jagienka will be his\r\nlady, not the other girl; and I wish it because he is my relative and I\r\nlike him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah! What about his vow?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will give him absolution in the twinkling of an eye! Have you not\r\nheard that I promised to absolve him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your head is wise about everything,\" answered Zych.\r\n\r\nThe abbot was pleased with this praise; then he approached nearer\r\nJagienka and asked:\r\n\r\n\"Why are you so sad?\"\r\n\r\nShe leaned on the saddle, seized the abbot's hand and lifted it to her\r\nmouth:\r\n\r\n\"Godfather, could you not send your _shpilmen_ to Krzesnia?\"\r\n\r\n\"What for? They will get drunk in the inn--that's all.\"\r\n\r\n\"But they may prevent a quarrel.\"\r\n\r\nThe abbot looked into her eyes and then said sharply:\r\n\r\n\"Let them even kill him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then they must kill me also!\" exclaimed Jagienka.\r\n\r\nThe bitterness which had accumulated in her bosom since that conversation\r\nabout Danusia with Zbyszko, mingled with grief, now gushed forth in a\r\nstream of tears. Seeing this, the abbot encircled her with his arm,\r\nalmost covering her with his enormous sleeve, and began to talk:\r\n\r\n\"Do not be afraid, my dear little girl. They may quarrel, but the other\r\nboys are noblemen; they will attack him only in a chivalrous manner; they\r\nwill call him up on the field, and then he can manage for himself, even\r\nif he be obliged to fight with both of them at once. As for Jurandowna,\r\nabout whom you have heard, I will tell you this: there is no wood growing\r\nfor a bed for the other girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"If he prefers the other girl, then I do not care about him,\" answered\r\nJagienka, through her tears.\r\n\r\n\"Then why do you, weep?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I am afraid for him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Woman's sense!\" said the abbot, laughing.\r\n\r\nThen having bent toward Jagienka's ear, he said:\r\n\r\n\"You must remember, dear girl, that even if he take you, he will be\r\nobliged to fight just the same; a nobleman must be a knight.\" Here he\r\nbent still closer and added:\r\n\r\n\"And he will take you, and before long, as God is in heaven!\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know about that!\" answered Jagienka.\r\n\r\nBut she began to smile through her tears, and to look at the abbot as if\r\nshe wished to ask him how he knew it.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Zbyszko having returned to Krzesnia, went directly to the\r\npriest, because he really wished to have a mass read for Macko's health;\r\nafter having settled about that, he went to the inn, where he expected to\r\nfind young Wilk of Brzozowa, and Cztan of Rogow.\r\n\r\nHe found both of them there, and also many other people, noblemen,\r\nfarmers and a few \"madcap fellows\" showing different German tricks. At\r\nfirst he could not recognize anybody, because the windows of the inn\r\nbeing made of ox bladders, did not let in a good light; but when the\r\nservant put some resinous wood on the fire, he noticed in the corner\r\nbehind the beer buckets, Cztan's hairy cheeks, and Wilk's furious face.\r\n\r\nThen he walked slowly toward them, pushing aside the people; when he\r\nreached them, he struck the table so heavily with his fist that the noise\r\nresounded throughout the whole inn.\r\n\r\nThey arose immediately and began to turn their girdles; but before they\r\ncould grasp the hilts of their swords, Zbyszko threw down a glove, and\r\nspeaking through his nose, as the knights used to speak while\r\nchallenging, he said these words which were unexpected by everybody:\r\n\r\n\"If either of you, or any other knightly person here present, deny that\r\nthe most beautiful and most virtuous girl in the world is _Panna_ Danuta\r\nJurandowna of Spychow, that one I will challenge to combat, on horseback\r\nor on foot, until the first kneeling, or until the last breath.\"\r\n\r\nWilk and Cztan were astonished as much as the abbot would have been, had\r\nhe heard Zbyszko's words; and for a while they could not say a word. Who\r\nwas this _panna_? They cared about Jagienka and not about her; and if\r\nthis youth did not care for Jagienka, then what did he wish? Why had he\r\nmade them angry in the church-yard? What did he return for, and why did\r\nhe wish to quarrel with them? These questions produced such confusion in\r\ntheir minds, that they opened their mouths widely and stared at Zbyszko\r\nas if he were not a man, but some German wonder.\r\n\r\nBut the more intelligent Wilk, who was a little familiar with chivalrous\r\ncustoms and knew that often a knight served one lady, but married\r\nanother, thought that this must be a similar case, and that he must seize\r\nthe opportunity, to defend Jagienka.\r\n\r\nTherefore he came out from behind the table, and coming close to Zbyszko,\r\nasked threateningly:\r\n\r\n\"Then, you dog-brother, you mean to say that Jagienka Zychowna is not the\r\nmost beautiful girl in the world?\"\r\n\r\nCztan followed him; and the people surrounded them, because they\r\nunderstood that it would not end in words.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nWhen Jagienka reached home, she immediately sent a servant to Krzesnia to\r\nlearn whether there had been a fight in the inn, or whether there had\r\nbeen a challenge. But the servant having received a _skojec_,[85] began\r\nto drink with the priest's servants, and did not hasten. Another servant\r\nwho had been sent to Bogdaniec to inform Macko that the abbot was going\r\nto pay him a visit, returned, having fulfilled the commission and\r\nreported that he had seen Zbyszko playing dice with the old man. This\r\npartly soothed Jagienka, because knowing by experience how dexterous\r\nZbyszko was, she was not so much afraid about a regular duel, as she was\r\nabout some unexpected accident in the inn. She wanted to accompany the\r\nabbot to Bogdaniec, but he was not willing. He wished to talk with Macko\r\nabout the pledge and about some other important business; and then he\r\nwanted to go there toward night. Having learned that Zbyszko had returned\r\nhome safe, he became very jovial and ordered his wandering seminarists to\r\nsing and shout. They obeyed him so well that the forest resounded with\r\nthe noise, and in Bogdaniec, the farmers came out from their houses, and\r\nlooked to see whether there was a fire or an invasion of the enemy. The\r\npilgrim riding ahead, quieted them by telling them that a high\r\necclesiastical dignitary was coming; therefore when they saw the abbot,\r\nthey bowed to him, and some of them even made the sign of the cross on\r\ntheir chests; he seeing how they respected him, rode along with joyful\r\npride, pleased with the world and full of kindness toward the people.\r\n\r\nMacko and Zbyszko having heard the singing, came to the gate to meet him.\r\nSome of the seminarists had been in Bogdaniec before with the abbot; but\r\nothers of them having joined the retinue lately, had never seen it until\r\nnow. They were disappointed when they saw the miserable house which could\r\nnot be compared with the large mansion in Zgorzelice. But they were\r\nreassured when they saw the smoke coming out from the thatched roof of\r\nthe house; and they were greatly pleased when upon entering the room,\r\nthey smelt saffron and different kinds of meats, and noticed two tables\r\nfull of tin dishes, empty as yet, but enormous. On the smaller table\r\nwhich was prepared for the abbot, shone a silver dish and also a\r\nbeautifully engraved silver cup, both taken with the other treasures from\r\nthe Fryzes.\r\n\r\nMacko and Zbyszko invited them to the table immediately; but the abbot\r\nwho had eaten plentifully in Zgorzelice, refused because he had something\r\nelse on his mind. Since his arrival he had looked at Zbyszko attentively\r\nand uneasily, as if he desired to see on him some traces of the fight;\r\nbut seeing the quiet face of the youth, he began to be impatient; finally\r\nhe was unable to restrain his curiosity any longer.\r\n\r\n\"Let us go into the chamber,\" said he, \"to speak about the pledge. Do not\r\nrefuse me; that will make me angry!\"\r\n\r\nHere he turned to the seminarists and shouted:\r\n\r\n\"You keep quiet and do not listen at the door!\"\r\n\r\nHaving said this, he opened the door to the chamber and entered, followed\r\nby Zbyszko and Macko. As soon as they were seated on the chests, the\r\nabbot turned toward the young knight:\r\n\r\n\"Did you go back to Krzesnia?\" asked he.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I was there.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I paid for a mass for my uncle's health, that's all.\"\r\n\r\nThe abbot moved on the chest impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"Ha!\" thought he, \"he did not meet Cztan and Wilk; perhaps they were not\r\nthere, and perhaps he did not look for them. I was mistaken.\"\r\n\r\nBut he was angry because he was mistaken, and because his plans had not\r\nbeen realized; therefore immediately his face grew red and he began to\r\nbreathe loudly.\r\n\r\n\"Let us speak about the pledge!\" said he. \"Have you the money? If not,\r\nthen the estate is mine!\"\r\n\r\nMacko, who knew how to act with him, rose silently, opened the chest on\r\nwhich he was sitting, and took out of it a bag of _grzywien_, evidently\r\nprepared for this occasion, and said:\r\n\r\n\"We are poor people, but we have the money; we will pay what is right, as\r\nit is written in the 'letter' which I signed with the mark of the holy\r\ncross. If you want to be paid for the improvements, we will not quarrel\r\nabout that either; we will pay the amount you say, and we will bow to\r\nyou, our benefactor.\"\r\n\r\nHaving said this, he kneeled at the abbot's knee and Zbyszko did the\r\nsame. The abbot, who expected some quarrels and arguing, was very much\r\nsurprised at such a proceeding, and not very much pleased with it; he\r\nwanted to dictate some conditions and he saw that he would have no\r\nopportunity to do so.\r\n\r\nTherefore returning the \"letter\" or rather the mortgage which Macko had\r\nsigned with a cross, he said:\r\n\r\n\"Why are you talking to me about an additional payment?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because we do not want to receive any presents,\" answered Macko\r\ncunningly, knowing well that the more he quarreled in that matter the\r\nmore he would get.\r\n\r\nAt this the abbot reddened with anger:\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever see such people? They do not wish to accept anything from a\r\nrelative! You have too much bread! I did not take waste land and I do not\r\nreturn it waste; and if I want to give you this bag, I will do it!\"\r\n\r\n\"You would not do that!\" exclaimed Macko.\r\n\r\n\"I will not do it! Here is your pledge! Here is your money! I give it\r\nbecause I want to, and had I even thrown it into the road, it would be\r\nnone of your affairs. You shall see if I will not do as I wish!\"\r\n\r\nHaving said this, he seized the bag and threw it on the floor so hard\r\nthat it burst, and the money was scattered.\r\n\r\n\"May God reward you! May God reward you, father and benefactor!\"\r\nexclaimed Macko, who had been waiting for this; \"I would not accept it\r\nfrom anyone else, but from a relation and a spiritual father, I will\r\naccept it.\"\r\n\r\nThe abbot looked threateningly at both of them, and finally he said:\r\n\r\n\"Although I am angry, I know what I am doing; therefore hold what you\r\nhave, because I assure you that you shall not have one _skojeo_ more.\"\r\n\r\n\"We did not expect even this.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know that Jagienka will inherit everything I have.\"\r\n\r\n\"The land also?\" asked Macko, simply.\r\n\r\n\"The land also!\" shouted the abbot.\r\n\r\nAt this Macko's face grew long, but he recovered himself and said:\r\n\r\n\"Ej, why should you think about death! May the Lord Jesus grant you a\r\nhundred years or more of life, and an important bishopric soon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly! Am I worse than others?\" said the abbot.\r\n\r\n\"Not worse, but better!\"\r\n\r\nThese words appeased the abbot, for his anger never lasted long.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said he, \"you are my relations, and she is only my goddaughter;\r\nbut I love her, and Zych also. There is no better man in the world than\r\nZych and no better girl than Jagienka, also! Who can say anything against\r\nthem?\"\r\n\r\nHe began to look angry, but Macko did not contradict; he quickly affirmed\r\nthat there was no worthier neighbor in the whole kingdom.\r\n\r\n\"And as for the girl,\" said he, \"I could not love my own daughter any\r\nmore than I love her. With her help, I recovered my health and I shall\r\nnever forget it until my death.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will both be punished if you forget it,\" said the abbot, \"and I will\r\ncurse you. But I do not wish to wrong you, therefore I have found a way\r\nby which, what I will leave after my death, can belong to you and to\r\nJagienka; do you understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"May God help us to realize that!\" answered Macko. \"Sweet Jesus! I would\r\ngo on foot to the grave of the queen in Krakow or to Lysa Gora[86] to bow\r\nto the Holy Cross.\"\r\n\r\nThe abbot was very much pleased with such sincerity; he smiled and said:\r\n\r\n\"The girl is perfectly right to be particular in her choice, because she\r\nis pretty, rich and of good family! Of what account are Cztan or Wilk,\r\nwhen the son of a _wojewoda_ would not be too good for her! But if\r\nsomebody, as myself for instance, spoke in favor of any particular one,\r\nthen she would marry him, because she loves me and knows that I will\r\nadvise her well.\"\r\n\r\n\"The one whom you advise her to marry, will be very lucky,\" said Macko.\r\n\r\nBut the abbot turned to Zbyszko:\r\n\r\n\"What do you say to this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I think the same as my uncle does.\"\r\n\r\nThe face of the abbot became still more serene; he struck Zbyszko's\r\nshoulder with his hand so hard that the blow resounded in the chamber,\r\nand asked:\r\n\r\n\"Why did you not let Cztan or Wilk approach Jagienka at church?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I did not want them to think that I was afraid of them, and I\r\ndid not want you to think so.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you gave the holy water to her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I did.\"\r\n\r\nThe abbot gave him another blow.\r\n\r\n\"Then, take her!\"\r\n\r\n\"Take her!\" exclaimed Macko, like an echo.\r\n\r\nAt this Zbyszko gathered up his hair, put it in the net, and answered\r\nquietly:\r\n\r\n\"How can I take her, when before the altar in Tyniec, I made a vow to\r\nDanusia Jurandowna?\"\r\n\r\n\"You made a vow about the peacock's tufts, and you must get them, but\r\ntake Jagienka immediately.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered Zbyszko; \"afterward when Danusia covered me with her veil,\r\nI promised that I would marry her.\"\r\n\r\nThe blood began to rush to the abbot's face; his ears turned blue, and\r\nhis eyes bulged; he approached Zbyszko and said, in a voice muffled with\r\nanger:\r\n\r\n\"Your vows are the chaff and I am the wind; understand! Ot!\"\r\n\r\nAnd he blew on Zbyszko's head so powerfully, that the net fell off and\r\nthe hair was scattered on his shoulders. Then Zbyszko frowned, and\r\nlooking into the abbot's eyes, he said:\r\n\r\n\"In my vows is my honor, and over my honor, I alone am the guardian!\"\r\n\r\nAt this, the abbot not being accustomed to opposition, lost his breath to\r\nsuch a degree, that for a time he could not speak. There was an\r\nill-omened silence, which finally was broken by Macko:\r\n\r\n\"Zbyszku!\" exclaimed he, \"come to your wits again! What is the matter\r\nwith you?\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the abbot raised his hand and pointing toward the youth, began\r\nto shout:\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter with him? I know what is the matter; he has not the\r\nheart of a nobleman, nor of a knight, but of a hare! That is the matter\r\nwith him; he is afraid of Cztan and Wilk!\"\r\n\r\nBut Zbyszko, who had remained cool and calm, carelessly shrugged his\r\nshoulders and answered:\r\n\r\n\"Owa! I broke their heads when I was in Krzesnia.\"\r\n\r\n\"For heaven's sake!\" exclaimed Macko.\r\n\r\nThe abbot stared for a while at Zbyszko. Anger was struggling with\r\nadmiration in him, and his reason told him that from that fight, he might\r\nderive some benefit for his plans.\r\n\r\nTherefore having become cooler, he shouted to Zbyszko:\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't you tell us that before?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I was ashamed. I thought they would challenge me, as it is\r\ncustomary for knights to do, to fight on horseback or on foot; but they\r\nare bandits, not knights. Wilk first took a board from the table, Cztan\r\nseized another and they both rushed against me! What could I do? I seized\r\na bench; well--you know!\"\r\n\r\n\"Are they still alive?\" asked Macko.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, they are alive, but they were hurt. They breathed when I left.\"\r\n\r\nThe abbot, rubbing his forehead, listened; then he suddenly jumped from\r\nthe chest, on which he had seated himself to be more comfortable and to\r\nthink the matter over, and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Wait! I want to tell you something!\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" asked Zbyszko.\r\n\r\n\"If you fought for Jagienka and injured them for her sake, then you are\r\nreally her knight, not Danusia's; and you must take Jagienka.\"\r\n\r\nHaving said this, he put his hands on his hips and looked at Zbyszko\r\ntriumphantly; but Zbyszko smiled and said:\r\n\r\n\"Hej! I knew very well why you wanted me to fight with them; but you have\r\nnot succeeded in your plans.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why? Speak!\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I challenged them to deny that Danusia Jurandowna is the\r\nprettiest and the most virtuous girl in the world; they took Jagienka's\r\npart, and that is why there was a fight.\"\r\n\r\nHaving heard this, the abbot stood amazed, and only the frequent movement\r\nof his eyes indicated that he was still alive. Finally he turned, opened\r\nthe door with his foot, and rushed into the other room; there he seized\r\nthe curved stick from the pilgrim's hands and began to strike the\r\n_shpilmen_ with it, roaring like a wounded urus.\r\n\r\n\"To horse, you rascals! To horse, you dog-faiths! I will not put my foot\r\nin this house again! To horse, he who believes in God, to horse!\"\r\n\r\nThen he opened the outer door and went into the court-yard, followed by\r\nthe frightened seminarists. They rushed to the stable and began to saddle\r\nthe horses. In vain Macko followed the abbot, and entreated him to\r\nremain; swore that it was not his fault. The abbot cursed the house, the\r\npeople and the fields; when they brought him a horse, he jumped in the\r\nsaddle without touching the stirrups and galloped away looking, with his\r\nlarge sleeves filled by the wind, like an enormous red bird. The\r\nseminarists rushed after him, like a herd following its leader.\r\n\r\nMacko stood looking after them for some time; but when they disappeared\r\nin the forest, he returned slowly to the room and said to Zbyszko,\r\nshaking his head sadly:\r\n\r\n\"See what you have done?\"\r\n\r\n\"It would not have happened if I had gone away; and it is your fault that\r\nI did not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I did not wish to leave you when you were sick.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what will you do now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now I shall go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where?\"\r\n\r\n\"To Mazowsze to see Danusia; and after that to search for peacock's tufts\r\namong the Germans.\"\r\n\r\nMacko was silent for a moment, then he said:\r\n\r\n\"He returned the 'letter,' but the mortgage is recorded in the\r\nmortgage-book at the court. Now the abbot will not give us even a\r\n_skojec_.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not care. You have money, and I do not need anything for my\r\njourney. I will be received everywhere and my horses will be fed; if I\r\nonly had a suit of armor on my back and a sword in my hand, I would need\r\nnothing else.\"\r\n\r\nMacko began to think about everything that had happened. All his plans\r\nand wishes had been frustrated. He had wished with his whole heart that\r\nZbyszko would marry Jagienka; but he now realized that this wish would\r\nnever be fulfilled; and considering the abbot's anger, the behavior of\r\nZbyszko toward Jagienka and finally the fight with Cztan and Wilk, he\r\nconcluded it would be better to allow Zbyszko to go.\r\n\r\n\"Ha!\" said he, finally, \"if you must seek for the peacock's feathers on\r\nthe heads of the Knights of the Cross, go then. Let the Lord Jesus' will\r\nbe accomplished. But I must go immediately to Zgorzelice; perhaps I will\r\nsucceed in appeasing their wrath if I implore pardon of the abbot and of\r\nZych; I care especially for the friendship of Zych.\"\r\n\r\nHere he looked into Zbyszko's eyes and asked:\r\n\r\n\"Do you not regret Jagienka?\"\r\n\r\n\"May God give her health and the best of everything!\" answered Zbyszko.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF PART SECOND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART THIRD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nMacko waited patiently for several days, hoping to receive some news from\r\nZgorzelice, or to hear that the abbot's anger had been appeased; finally\r\nhe became impatient and determined to go personally to see Zych.\r\nEverything had happened contrary to his wishes, and now he was anxious to\r\nknow whether Zych was angry with him. He was afraid that the abbot would\r\nnever be reconciled with Zbyszko and him. He wanted, however, to do\r\neverything he could, to soften that anger; therefore while riding, he was\r\nthinking what he would say in Zgorzelice, to palliate the offence and\r\npreserve the old friendship with his neighbor. His thoughts, however,\r\nwere not clear, therefore he was glad to find Jagienka alone; the girl\r\nreceived him as usual with a bow and kissed his hand,--in a word, she was\r\nfriendly, but a little sad.\r\n\r\n\"Is your father home?\" asked he.\r\n\r\n\"He went out hunting with the abbot. They may be back at any moment.\"\r\n\r\nHaving said this, she conducted him into the house, where they both sat\r\nin silence for a long time; the girl spoke first, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Are you lonely now in Bogdaniec?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very lonely,\" answered Macko. \"Then you knew that Zbyszko had gone\r\naway?\"\r\n\r\nJagienka sighed softly:\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I knew it the very same day; I thought he would come here to bid me\r\ngood-bye, but he did not.\"\r\n\r\n\"How could he come!\" said Macko. \"The abbot would have torn him to\r\npieces; neither would your father have welcomed him.\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head and said:\r\n\r\n\"Ej! I would not allow anybody to injure him.\"\r\n\r\nUpon this Macko hugged the girl and said:\r\n\r\n\"God be with you, girl! You are sad, but I also am sad. Let me tell you\r\nthat neither the abbot nor your own father loves you more than I do. I\r\nwish that Zbyszko had chosen you, and not another.\"\r\n\r\nThere came upon Jagienka such a moment of grief and longing, that she\r\ncould not conceal her feelings, but said:\r\n\r\n\"I shall never see him again, or if I see him, it will be with\r\nJurandowna, and then I will cry my eyes out.\"\r\n\r\nShe raised her apron and covered her eyes, which were filled with tears.\r\n\r\nMacko said:\r\n\r\n\"Stop crying! He has gone, but with God's grace, he will not come back\r\nwith Jurandowna.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" said Jagienka, from behind her apron.\r\n\r\n\"Because Jurand does not want to give him the girl.\"\r\n\r\nThen Jagienka suddenly uncovered her face, and having turned toward\r\nMacko, said to him:\r\n\r\n\"Zbyszko told me that; but is it true?\"\r\n\r\n\"As true as that God is in heaven.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who knows why. Some vow, or something like that, and there is no\r\nremission for vows! He liked Zbyszko, because the boy promised to help\r\nhim in his vengeance; but even that was useless. Jurand would listen\r\nneither to persuasion, nor to command, nor to prayers. He said he could\r\nnot. Well, there must be some reason why he could not do it, and he will\r\nnot change his mind, because he is stern and unyielding. Don't lose hope\r\nbut cheer up. Rightly speaking, the boy was obliged to go, because he had\r\nsworn in the church to secure three peacocks' crests. Then, also, the\r\ngirl covered him with her veil, which was a sign that she would take him\r\nfor her husband; otherwise they would have beheaded him; for that, he\r\nmust be grateful to her--one cannot deny it. With God's help, she will\r\nnot be his; but according to the law, he is hers. Zych is angry with him;\r\nthe abbot has sent a plague upon him, so that his skin shivers; I am\r\nangry also, but if one thinks carefully, what else could he do? Since he\r\nbelonged to the other girl, he was obliged to go. He is a nobleman. But I\r\ntell you this; if the Germans do not kill him, then he will come back;\r\nand he will come back not only to me an old man, not only to Bogdaniec,\r\nbut to you, because he was very fond of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe he was!\" said Jagienka.\r\n\r\nBut she drew near Macko, and having touched him with her elbow, she\r\nasked:\r\n\r\n\"How do you know it? I am sure that is not true.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do I know?\" answered Macko. \"I saw how difficult it was for him to\r\ngo away. When it was decided that he must go, I asked him: 'Do you not\r\nregret Jagienka?' and he said: 'May God give her health and the best of\r\neverything.' Then immediately he began to sigh.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure that it is not true!\" said Jagienka, softly; \"but tell me\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\n\"As God is dear to me, it is true! After seeing you, he will not care for\r\nthe other girl, because you know yourself that there is no girl more\r\nbeautiful than you in the whole world. He has felt God's will toward\r\nyou--do not fear--perhaps even more than you have felt it toward him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all!\" exclaimed Jagienka. Then she again covered her face, which\r\nwas as rosy as an apple, with her sleeve; Macko smiled, passed his hand\r\nover his moustache and said:\r\n\r\n\"Hej! if I were only younger; but you must comfort yourself, because I\r\nsee how it will be. He will get his spurs at the Mazowiecki court,\r\nbecause that is near the boundary and it is not difficult to kill a\r\nKrzyzak there. I know that there are good knights among the Germans; but\r\nI think that it will take a very good one to defeat Zbyszko. See how he\r\nrouted Cztan of Rogow and Wilk of Brzozowa, although they are said to be\r\ndreadful boys and as strong as bears. He will bring his crests, but he\r\nwill not bring Jurandowna.\"\r\n\r\n\"But when will he return?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah I if you are not willing to wait, then you will not be wronged.\r\nRepeat what I have told you to the abbot and to Zych; perhaps they will\r\nnot be so angry with Zbyszko.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can I tell them anything? _Tatus_ is more sorrowful than angry; but\r\nit is dangerous even to mention Zbyszko's name to the abbot. He scolded\r\nme because I sent Zbyszko a servant.\"\r\n\r\n\"What servant?\"\r\n\r\n\"We had a Czech, whom _tatus_ captured at Boleslawiec, a good, faithful\r\nboy. His name was Hlawa. _Tatus_ gave him to my service, because he was a\r\n_wlodyka_; I gave him a worthy armor and sent him to Zbyszko, to serve\r\nand protect him. I also gave him a bag of money for the journey. He\r\npromised me that he would serve Zbyszko faithfully until death.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear girl! may God reward you! Was Zych opposed to your doing it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, at first _tatus_ did not want to let me do it; but when I began to\r\ncoax him, then he consented. When the abbot heard about it from his\r\nseminarists, he immediately rushed out of the room swearing; there was\r\nsuch a disturbance, that _tatus_ escaped to the barn. Toward evening, the\r\nabbot took pity on my tears and even made me a present of some beads.\"\r\n\r\n\"As God is dear to me, I do not know whether I love Zbyszko any better\r\nthan I love you; but he had a worthy retinue. I also gave him money,\r\nalthough he did not want to take it. Well, the Mazurs are not beyond the\r\nseas.\"\r\n\r\nThe conversation was interrupted by the barking of dogs, by shouting and\r\nby the sounds of brass trumpets in front of the house. Having heard this,\r\nJagienka said:\r\n\r\n\"_Tatus_ and the abbot have returned from hunting. Let us go outside; it\r\nwill be better for the abbot to see you there, and not to meet you\r\nunexpectedly in the house.\"\r\n\r\nHaving said this, she conducted Macko out-of-doors; in the courtyard, on\r\nthe snow they perceived a throng of men, horses and dogs, also elks and\r\nwolves pierced with spears or shot with crossbows. The abbot saw Macko\r\nbefore he dismounted, and hurled a spear toward him, not to strike him,\r\nbut to show in that way, his great anger against the inhabitants of\r\nBogdaniec. But Macko uncovered and bowed to him as if he noticed nothing\r\nunusual; Jagienka, however, had not noticed the abbot's action, because\r\nshe was very much surprised to see her two wooers in the retinue.\r\n\r\n\"Cztan and Wilk are here!\" she exclaimed; \"I presume they met _tatus_ in\r\nthe forest.\"\r\n\r\nImmediately the thought ran through Macko's mind, that perhaps one of\r\nthem would get Jagienka, and with her Moczydoly, the abbot's lands,\r\nforests and money. Then grief and anger filled his heart, especially when\r\nhe perceived what occurred. Behold, Wilk of Brzozowa, although only a\r\nshort time before the abbot wanted to fight with his father, sprang to\r\nthe abbot's stirrups, and helped him to dismount; and the abbot leaned in\r\na friendly manner on the young nobleman's shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"In that way, the abbot will become reconciled with old Wilk,\" thought\r\nMacko, \"and he will give the forests and the lands with the girl.\"\r\n\r\nHis sad thoughts were interrupted by Jagienka who said:\r\n\r\n\"They are soon cured after Zbyszko's beating; but even if they come here\r\nevery day, it will not benefit them!\"\r\n\r\nMacko looked and saw that the girl's face was red with anger, and that\r\nher blue eyes sparkled with indignation, although she knew very well that\r\nCztan and Wilk had taken her part in the inn, and had been beaten on her\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nTherefore Macko said:\r\n\r\n\"Bah! you will do as the abbot commands.\"\r\n\r\nShe immediately retorted:\r\n\r\n\"The abbot will do what I wish.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gracious Lord!\" thought Macko, \"and that stupid Zbyszko left such a\r\ngirl!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nZbyszko had left Bogdaniec with a sad heart indeed. In the first place he\r\nfelt strange without his uncle, from whom he had never been separated\r\nbefore, and to whom he was so accustomed, that he did not know how he\r\nwould get along without him during the journey, as well as in the war.\r\nThen he regretted Jagienka. Although he was going to Danusia whom he\r\nloved dearly, still he had been so comfortable and happy with Jagienka,\r\nthat now he felt sad without her. He was surprised himself at his grief,\r\nand even somewhat alarmed about it. He would not have minded if he longed\r\nfor Jagienka only as a brother longs for a sister; but he noticed that he\r\nlonged to embrace her, to put her on horseback, to carry her over the\r\nbrooks, to wring the water from her tress, to wander with her in the\r\nforest, to gaze at her, and to converse with her. He was so accustomed to\r\ndoing all this and it was so pleasant, that when he began to think about\r\nit, he forgot that he was going on a long journey to Mazury; instead of\r\nthat, he remembered the moment when Jagienka helped him in the forest,\r\nwhen he was struggling with the bear. It seemed to him as though it\r\nhappened only yesterday; also as though it were only yesterday when they\r\nwent to the Odstajny lake for beavers. Then he recalled how beautifully\r\nshe was dressed when going to church in Krzesnia, and how surprised he\r\nwas that such a simple girl should appear like the daughter of a mighty\r\nlord. All these thoughts filled his heart with uneasiness, sweetness, and\r\nsadness.\r\n\r\n\"Had I only bid her good-bye,\" he said to himself, \"perhaps I would feel\r\neasier now.\"\r\n\r\nFinally he became afraid of these reminiscences, and he shook them from\r\nhis mind like dry snow from his mantle.\r\n\r\n\"I am going to Danusia, to my dearest,\" he said to himself.\r\n\r\nHe noticed that this was a more holy love. Gradually his feet grew colder\r\nin the stirrups, and the cold wind cooled his blood. All his thoughts now\r\nturned to Danusia Jurandowna. He belonged to her without any doubt; but\r\nfor her, he would have been beheaded on the Krakowski square. When she\r\nsaid in the presence of the knights and burghers: \"He is mine!\" she\r\nrescued him from the hands of the executioners; from that time, he\r\nbelonged to her, as a slave to his master. Jurand's opposition was\r\nuseless. She alone could drive him away; and even then he would not go\r\nfar, because he was bound by his vow. He imagined, however, that she\r\nwould not drive him away; but rather that she would follow him from the\r\nMazowiecki court, even to the end of the world. Then he began to praise\r\nher to himself to Jagienka's disadvantage, as if it were her fault, that\r\ntemptations assailed him and his heart was divided. Now he forgot that\r\nJagienka cured old Macko; he forgot that without her help, the bear would\r\nhave torn him to pieces; and he became enraged with her, hoping in this\r\nway to please Danusia and to justify himself in his own eyes.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the Czech, Hlawa, sent by Jagienka, arrived, leading a\r\nhorse.\r\n\r\n\"Be blessed!\" said he, with a low bow.\r\n\r\nZbyszko had seen him once or twice in Zgorzelice, but he did not\r\nrecognize him; therefore he said:\r\n\r\n\"Be blessed for ages and ages! Who are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your servant, famous lord.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean? These are my servants,\" said Zbyszko, pointing to the\r\ntwo Turks, given to him by Sulimczyk Zawisza, and to two sturdy men who\r\nsitting on horseback, were leading the knight's stallions; \"these are\r\nmine; who sent you?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Panna_ Jagienka Zychowna of Zgorzelice.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Panna_ Jagienka?\"\r\n\r\nA while ago, Zbyszko had been angry with her and his heart was still full\r\nof wrath; therefore he said:\r\n\r\n\"Return home and thank the _panna_ for the favor; I do not want you.\"\r\n\r\nBut the Czech shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot return. They have given me to you; besides that, I have sworn\r\nto serve you until death.\"\r\n\r\n\"If they gave you to me, then you are my servant.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yours, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I command you to return.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have sworn; although I am a prisoner from Boleslawiec and a poor boy,\r\nstill I am a _wlodyczka_.\"[87]\r\n\r\nZbyszko became angry:\r\n\r\n\"Go away! What; are you going to serve me against my will? Go away,\r\nbefore I order my servants to bend their crossbows.\"\r\n\r\nBut the Czech quietly untied a broadcloth mantle, lined with wolf-skins,\r\nhanded it to Zbyszko and said:\r\n\r\n\"_Panna_ Jagienka sent you this, also, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you wish me to break your bones?\" asked Zbyszko, taking a spear from\r\nan attendant.\r\n\r\n\"Here is also a bag of money for your disposal,\" answered the Czech.\r\n\r\nZbyszko was ready to strike him with the lance, but he recollected that\r\nthe boy, although a prisoner, was by birth a _wlodyka_, who had remained\r\nwith Zych only because he did not have money to pay his ransom;\r\nconsequently Zbyszko dropped the spear.\r\n\r\nThen the Czech bent to his stirrups and said:\r\n\r\n\"Be not angry, sir. If you do not wish me to accompany you, I will follow\r\nyou at a distance of one or two furlongs; but I must go, because I have\r\nsworn to do so upon the salvation of my soul.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I order my servants to kill you or to bind you?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you order them to kill me, that will not be my sin; and if you order\r\nthem to bind me, then I will remain until some good people untie me, or\r\nuntil the wolves devour me.\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko did not reply; he urged his horse forward and his attendants\r\nfollowed him. The Czech with a crossbow and an axe on his shoulder,\r\nfollowed them, shielding himself with a shaggy bison skin, because a\r\nsharp wind carrying flakes of snow, began to blow. The storm grew worse\r\nand worse. The Turks, although dressed in sheepskin coats, were chilled\r\nwith cold; Zbyszko himself, not being dressed very warmly, glanced\r\nseveral times at the mantle lined with wolf-fur, which Hlawa had brought\r\nhim; after a while, he told one of the Turks to give it to him.\r\n\r\nHaving wrapped himself with it carefully, he felt a warmth spreading all\r\nover his body. He covered his eyes and the greater part of his face with\r\nthe hood of the mantle, so that the wind did not annoy him any more.\r\nThen, involuntarily, he thought how good Jagienka had been to him. He\r\nreined in his horse, called the Czech, and asked him about her, and about\r\neverything that had happened in Zgorzelice.\r\n\r\n\"Does Zych know that the _panna_ sent you to me?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"He knows it,\" answered Hlawa.\r\n\r\n\"Was he not opposed to it?\"\r\n\r\n\"He was.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me then all about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"The _pan_ was walking in the room and the _panna_ followed him. He\r\nshouted, but the _panienka_ said nothing; but when he turned toward her,\r\nshe kneeled but did not utter one word. Finally the _panisko_[88] said:\r\n'Have you become deaf, that you do not answer my questions? Speak then;\r\nperhaps I will consent.' Then the _panna_ understood that she could do as\r\nshe wished and began to thank him. The _pan_ reproached her, because she\r\nhad persuaded him, and complained that he must always do as she wished;\r\nfinally he said: 'Promise me that you will not go secretly to bid him\r\ngood-bye; then I will consent, but not otherwise.' Then the _panienka_\r\nbecame very sorrowful, but she promised; the _pan_ was satisfied, because\r\nthe abbot and he were both afraid that she would see you. Well, that was\r\nnot the end of it; afterward the _panna_ wanted to send two horses, but\r\nthe _pan_ would not consent; the _panna_ wanted to send a wolf-skin and a\r\nbag of money, but the _pan_ refused. His refusal did not amount to\r\nanything, however! If she wanted to set the house on fire, the _panisko_\r\nwould finally consent. Therefore I brought two horses, a wolf-skin and a\r\nbag of money.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good girl!\" thought Zbyszko. After a while he asked:\r\n\r\n\"Was there no trouble with the abbot?\" The Czech, an intelligent\r\nattendant, who understood what happened around him, smiled and answered:\r\n\r\n\"They were both careful to keep everything secret from the abbot; I do\r\nnot know what happened when he learned about it, after I left Zgorzelice.\r\nSometimes he shouts at the _panienka_; but afterward he watches her to\r\nsee if he did not wrong her. I saw him myself one time after he had\r\nscolded her, go to his chest and bring out such a beautiful chain that\r\none could not get a better one even in Krakow, and give it to her. She\r\nwill manage the abbot also, because her own father does not love her any\r\nmore than he does.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is certainly true.\"\r\n\r\n\"As God is in heaven!\"\r\n\r\nThen they became silent and rode along amidst wind and snow. Suddenly\r\nZbyszko reined in his horse; from the forest beside the road, there was\r\nheard a plaintive voice, half stifled by the roar of the wind:\r\n\r\n\"Christians, help God's servant in his misfortune!\"\r\n\r\nThereupon a man who was dressed partly in clerical clothing, rushed to\r\nthe road and began to cry to Zbyszko:\r\n\r\n\"Whoever you are, sir, help a fellow-creature who has met with a dreadful\r\naccident!\"\r\n\r\n\"What has happened to you, and who are you?\" asked the young knight.\r\n\r\n\"I am God's servant, although not yet ordained; this morning the horse\r\nwhich was carrying my chests containing holy things, ran away. I remained\r\nalone, without weapons; evening is approaching, and soon the wild beasts\r\nwill begin to roar in the forest. I shall perish, unless you succor me.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I let you perish,\" answered Zbyszko, \"I will be accountable for your\r\nsins; but how can I believe that you are speaking the truth. You may be a\r\nhighway robber, like many others wandering on the roads!\"\r\n\r\n\"You may believe me, sir, for I will show you the chests. Many a man\r\nwould give a purse full of gold for what is in them; but I will give you\r\nsome of it for nothing, if you take me and the chests with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You told me that you were God's servant, and yet you do not know that\r\none must give help, not for earthly recompense, but for spiritual reward.\r\nBut how is it that you have the chests now if the horse carried them\r\naway?\"\r\n\r\n\"The wolves devoured the horse in the forest, but the chests remained; I\r\nbrought them to the road, and then waited for mercy and help.\"\r\n\r\nWishing to prove that he was speaking the truth, he pointed to two chests\r\nmade of leather, lying under a pine tree. Zbyszko still looked at him\r\nsuspiciously, because the man did not look honest, and his speech\r\nindicated that he came from a distant part of the country. He did not\r\nrefuse to help him, however, but permitted him to ride the horse led by\r\nthe Czech and take the chests, which proved to be very light.\r\n\r\n\"May God multiply your victories, valiant knight!\" said the stranger.\r\n\r\nThen, seeing Zbyszko's youthful face, he added softly:\r\n\r\n\"And the hairs of your beard, also.\"\r\n\r\nHe rode beside the Czech. For a time they could not talk, because a\r\nstrong wind was blowing, and roaring in the forest; but when it\r\ndecreased, Zbyszko heard the following conversation behind him.\r\n\r\n\"I don't deny that you were in Rome; but you look like a beer drunkard,\"\r\nsaid the Czech.\r\n\r\n\"Look out for eternal damnation,\" answered the stranger; \"you are talking\r\nto a man who last Easter ate hard boiled eggs with the holy father. Don't\r\nspeak to me in such cold weather about beer; but if you have a flask of\r\nwine with you, then give me two or three swallows of it, and I will\r\npardon you a month of purgatory.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have not been ordained; I heard you say you had not. How then can\r\nyou grant me pardon for a month of purgatory?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have not received ordination, but I have my head shaved, because I\r\nreceived permission for that; beside, I am carrying indulgences and\r\nrelics.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the chests?\" asked the Czech.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, in the chests. If you saw all I have there, you would fall on your\r\nface, not only you, but all the pines in the forest and all the wild\r\nbeasts.\"\r\n\r\nBut the Czech, being an intelligent and experienced attendant, looked\r\nsuspiciously at this peddler of indulgences, and said:\r\n\r\n\"The wolves devoured your horse?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, they devoured him, because they are the devil's relatives. If you\r\nhave any wine, give me some; although the wind has ceased, yet I am\r\nfrozen, having sat by the road so long.\"\r\n\r\nThe Czech would not give him any wine; and they rode along silently,\r\nuntil the stranger began to ask:\r\n\r\n\"Where are you going?\"\r\n\r\n\"Far. At first to Sieradz. Are you going with us?\"\r\n\r\n\"I must. I will sleep in the stable, and perhaps to-morrow this pious\r\nknight will give me a present of a horse; then I will go further.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are you from?\"\r\n\r\n\"From under Prussian lords, not far from Marienburg.\"\r\n\r\nHaving heard this, Zbyszko turned and motioned to the stranger to come\r\nnearer to him.\r\n\r\n\"Did you come from Marienburg?\" said he\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"But are you a German? You speak our language very well. What is your\r\nname?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am a German, and they call me Sanderus; I speak your language well,\r\nbecause I was born in Torun, where everybody speaks that language; then I\r\nlived in Marienburg, and there it is the same. Bah! even the brothers of\r\nthe Order understand your language.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long since you left Marienburg?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was in the Holy Land, then in Constantinople, and in Rome; thence\r\nthrough France I came to Marienburg and from there I was going to\r\nMazowsze, carrying the holy relics which pious Christians buy willingly,\r\nfor the salvation of their souls.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you been in Plock or in Warszawa?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was in both cities. May God give good health to both of the\r\nprincesses! Princess Alexandra is greatly esteemed even by the Prussian\r\nlords, because she is a pious lady; the princess Anna Januszowna is also\r\npious.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you see the court in Warszawa?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not see it in Warszawa but in Ciechanow, where both the princesses\r\nreceived me hospitably, and gave me munificent presents, as God's servant\r\ndeserves to receive. I left them relics, which will bring them God's\r\nblessing.\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko wanted to ask about Danusia; but he understood that it would be\r\nunwise to make a confidant of this stranger, a man of low origin.\r\nTherefore, after a short silence, he asked:\r\n\r\n\"What kind of relics are you carrying?\"\r\n\r\n\"I carry indulgences and relics; the indulgences are different kinds;\r\nthere are total indulgences, some for five hundred years, some for three\r\nhundred, some for two hundred and some for less time, which are cheaper,\r\nso that even poor people can buy them and shorten the torments of\r\npurgatory. I have indulgences for future and for past sins; but don't\r\nthink, sir, that I keep the money I receive for them. I am satisfied with\r\na piece of black bread and a glass of water--that is all for me; the rest\r\nI carry to Rome, to accumulate enough for a new crusade. It is true,\r\nthere are many swindlers who carry false indulgences, false relics, false\r\nseals and false testimonials; and they are righteously pursued by the\r\nholy father's letters; but I was wronged by the prior of Sieradz, because\r\nmy seals are authentic. Look, sir, at the wax and tell me what you think\r\nof them.\"\r\n\r\n\"What about the prior of Sieradz?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, sir! I fear that he is infected with Wiklef's heresy. If, as your\r\nshield-bearer told me, you are going to Sieradz, it will be better for me\r\nnot to show myself to him, because I do not want to lead him into the sin\r\nof blasphemy against holy things.\"\r\n\r\n\"This means, speaking frankly, that he thinks that you are a swindler.\"\r\n\r\n\"If the question were about myself, I would pardon him for the sake of\r\nbrotherly love; but he has blasphemed against my holy wares, for which, I\r\nam very much afraid, he will be eternally damned.\"\r\n\r\n\"What kind of holy wares have you?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not right to talk about them with covered head; but this time,\r\nhaving many indulgences ready, I give you, sir, permission to keep your\r\ncowl on, because the wind is blowing again. For that you will buy an\r\nindulgence and the sin will not be counted against you. What have I not?\r\nI have a hoof of the ass on which the Holy Family rode during the flight\r\ninto Egypt; it was found near the pyramids. The king of Aragon offered me\r\nfifty ducats for it. I have a feather from the wings of the archangel\r\nGabriel, which he dropped during the annunciation; I have the heads of\r\ntwo quails, sent to the Israelites in the desert; I have the oil in which\r\nthe heathen wanted to fry St. John; a step of the ladder about which\r\nJacob dreamed; the tears of St. Mary of Egypt and some rust of St.\r\nPeter's keys. But I cannot mention any more. I am very cold and your\r\nshield-bearer would not give me any wine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Those are great relics, if they are authentic!\" said Zbyszko.\r\n\r\n\"If they are authentic? Take the spear from your attendant and aim it,\r\nbecause the devil is near and brings such thoughts to you. Hold him, sir,\r\nat the length of the spear. If you do not wish to bring some misfortune\r\non yourself, then buy an indulgence from me; otherwise within three weeks\r\nsomebody whom you love, will die.\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko was frightened at this threat, because he thought about Danusia,\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n\"It is not I, but the prior of the Dominicans in Sieradz who does not\r\nbelieve.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look, sir, for yourself, at the wax on the seals; as for the prior, I do\r\nnot know whether he is still living, because God's justice is quick.\"\r\n\r\nBut when they came to Sieradz they found the prior alive. Zbyszko went to\r\nsee him, and purchased two masses; one of which was to be read to insure\r\nsuccess for Macko's vow, and the other to insure success for his vow to\r\nobtain three peacocks' crests. The prior was a foreigner, having been\r\nborn in Cylia; but during his forty years' residence in Sieradz, he had\r\nlearned the Polish language very well, and was a great enemy of the\r\nKnights of the Cross. Therefore, having learned about Zbyszko's\r\nenterprise, he said:\r\n\r\n\"A still greater punishment will fall upon them; but I shall not dissuade\r\nyou, because you promised it upon your knightly honor; neither can there\r\nbe punishment enough administered by Polish hands for the wrongs they\r\nhare perpetrated in this land.\"\r\n\r\n\"What have they done?\" asked Zbyszko, who was anxious to hear about the\r\niniquities of the Knights of the Cross.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nThe old prior crossed his hands and began to recite aloud \"The eternal\r\nrest;\"[89] then he sat down on a bench and kept his eyes closed for a\r\nwhile as if to collect his thoughts; finally he began to talk:\r\n\r\n\"Wincenty of Szamotul brought them here. I was twenty years old then, and\r\nI had just come from Cylia with my uncle Petzoldt. The Krzyzaks attacked\r\nthe town and set it on fire. We could see from the walls, how in the\r\nmarket square they cut men and women's heads off, and how they threw\r\nlittle children into the fire. They even killed the priests, because in\r\ntheir fury they spared nobody. The prior Mikolaj, having been born in\r\nElblong, was acquainted with _Comthur_ Herman, the chief of their army.\r\nTherefore he went accompanied by the senior brothers, to that dreadful\r\nknight, and having kneeled before him, entreated him in German, to have\r\npity on Christian blood. _Comthur_ Herman replied: \"I do not understand,\"\r\nand ordered his soldiers to continue killing the people. They slaughtered\r\nthe monks also, among them my uncle Petzoldt; the prior Mikolaj was tied\r\nto a horse's tail. The next morning there was no man alive in this town\r\nexcept the Krzyzaks and myself. I hid on a beam in the belfry. God\r\npunished them at Plowce;[90] but they still want to destroy this\r\nChristian kingdom, and nothing will deter them unless God's arm crush\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"At Plowce,\" said Zbyszko, \"almost all the men of my family perished; but\r\nI do not regret it, for God granted a great victory to the king\r\nLokietek,[91] and twenty thousand Germans were destroyed.\r\n\r\n\"You will see a still greater war and a greater victory,\" said the prior.\r\n\r\n\"Amen!\" answered Zbyszko.\r\n\r\nThen they began to talk about other matters. The young knight asked about\r\nthe peddler of relics whom he met on the road. He learned that many\r\nsimilar swindlers were wandering on the roads, cheating credulous people.\r\nThe prior also told him that there were papal bulls ordering the bishops\r\nto examine such peddlers and immediately punish those who did not have\r\nauthentic letters and seals. The testimonials of the stranger seemed\r\nspurious to the prior; therefore he wanted to deliver him to the bishop's\r\njurisdiction. If he proved that he was sent by the pope, then no harm\r\nwould be done him. He escaped, however. Perhaps he was afraid of the\r\ndelay in his journey; but on account of this flight, he had drawn on\r\nhimself still greater suspicion.\r\n\r\nThe prior invited Zbyszko to remain and pass the night in the monastery;\r\nbut he would not, because he wanted to hang in front of the inn an\r\ninscription challenging all knights who denied that _Panna_ Danuta\r\nJurandowna was the most beautiful and the most virtuous girl in the\r\nkingdom, to a combat on horseback or on foot. It was not proper to hang\r\nsuch a challenge over the gate of the monastery. When he arrived at the\r\ninn, he asked for Sanderus.\r\n\r\n\"The prior thinks you are a scoundrel,\" said Zbyszko, \"because he said:\r\n'Why should he be afraid of the bishop's judgment, if he had good\r\ntestimonials?'\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not afraid of the bishop,\" answered Sanderus; \"I am afraid of the\r\nmonks, who do not know anything about seals. I wanted to go to Krakow,\r\nbut I have no horse; therefore I must wait until somebody makes me a\r\npresent of one. Meanwhile, I will send a letter, and I will put my own\r\nseal on it.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you show that you know how to write, that will prove that you are not\r\na churl; but how will you send the letter?\"\r\n\r\n\"By some pilgrim, or wandering monk. There are many people going on a\r\npilgrimage to the queen's tomb.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you write a card for me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will write, sir, even on a board, anything you wish.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think it will be better on a board,\" said Zbyszko, \"because it will\r\nnot tear and I can use it again later on.\"\r\n\r\nIn fact, after awhile the attendants brought a new board and Sanderus\r\nwrote on it. Zbyszko could not read what was written on the board; but he\r\nordered it fastened with nails on the door of the inn, under it to be\r\nhung a shield, which was watched by the Turks alternately. Whoever struck\r\nthe shield would declare that he wished to fight. But neither that day\r\nnor the following day, did the shield resound from a blow; and in the\r\nafternoon the sorrowful knight was ready to pursue his journey.\r\n\r\nBefore that, however, Sanderus came to Zbyszko and said to him:\r\n\r\n\"Sir, if you hang your shield in the land of the Prussian lords, I am\r\nsure your shield-bearer will buckle your armor.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean! Don't you know that a Krzyzak, being a monk, cannot\r\nhave a lady nor be in love with one, because it is forbidden him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know whether it is forbidden them or not; but I know that they\r\nhave them. It is true that a Krzyzak cannot fight a duel without bringing\r\nreproach on himself, because he swore that he would fight only for the\r\nfaith; but besides the monks, there are many secular knights from distant\r\ncountries, who came to help the Prussian lords. They are looking for some\r\none to fight with, and especially the French knights.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Owa!_ I saw them at Wilno, and with God's permission I shall see them\r\nin Marienburg. I need the peacocks' crests from their helmets, because I\r\nmade a vow--do you understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir, I will sell you two or three drops of the perspiration, which St.\r\nGeorge shed while fighting with the dragon. There is no relic, which\r\ncould be more useful to a knight. Give me the horse for it, on which you\r\npermitted me to ride; then I will also give you an indulgence for the\r\nChristian blood which you will shed in the fight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me be, or I shall become angry. I shall not buy your wares until I\r\nknow they are genuine.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are going, sir, so you have said, to the Mazowiecki court. Ask there\r\nhow many relics they bought from me, the princess herself, the knights\r\nand the girls for their weddings, at which I was present.\"\r\n\r\n\"For what weddings?\" asked Zbyszko.\r\n\r\n\"As is customary before advent, the knights were marrying as soon as they\r\ncould, because the people are expecting that there will be a war between\r\nthe Polish king and the Prussian lords about the province of Dobrzyn.\r\nTherefore some of them say: 'God knows whether I shall return.'\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko was very anxious to hear about the war, but still more anxious to\r\nhear about the weddings, of which Sanderus was talking; therefore he\r\nasked:\r\n\r\n\"Which girls were married there?\"\r\n\r\n\"The princess' ladies-in-waiting. I do not know whether even one\r\nremained, because I heard the princess say that she would be obliged to\r\nlook for other attendants.\"\r\n\r\nHaving heard this, Zbyszko was silent for awhile; then he asked in an\r\naltered voice:\r\n\r\n\"Was _Panna_ Danuta Jurandówna, whose name is on the board, married\r\nalso?\"\r\n\r\nSanderus hesitated before he answered. He did not know anything correctly\r\nhimself; then he thought that if he kept the knight anxious and\r\nperplexed, he would have more influence over him. He wanted to retain his\r\npower over this knight who had a goodly retinue, and was well provided\r\nwith everything.\r\n\r\nZbyszko's youth led him to suppose that he would be a generous lord,\r\nwithout forethought and careless of money. He had noticed already the\r\ncostly armor made in Milan, and the enormous stallions, which everybody\r\ncould not possess; then he assured himself that if he traveled with such\r\na knight, he would receive hospitality in noblemen's houses, and a good\r\nopportunity to sell his indulgences; he would be safe during the journey,\r\nand have abundance of food and drink, about which he cared greatly.\r\n\r\nTherefore having heard Zbyszko's question, he frowned, lifted his eyes as\r\nif he were trying to recollect, and answered:\r\n\r\n\"_Panna_ Danuta Jurandowna? Where is she from?\"\r\n\r\n\"Jurandowna Danuta of Spychow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw all of them, but I cannot remember their names.\"\r\n\r\n\"She is very young; she plays the lute, and amuses the princess with her\r\nsinging.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aha--young--plays the lute--there were some young ones married also. Is\r\nshe dark like an agate?\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko breathed more freely.\r\n\r\n\"No, that was not she! Danusia is as white as snow, but has pink cheeks.\"\r\n\r\nTo this Sanderus replied:\r\n\r\n\"One of them, dark as an agate, remained with the princess; the others\r\nwere almost all married.\"\r\n\r\n\"You say 'almost all,' therefore not all. For God's sake, if you wish to\r\nget anything from me, then try to recollect.\"\r\n\r\n\"In two or three days I could recollect; the best way will be to give me\r\na horse, on which I can carry my holy wares.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will get it if you only tell me the truth.\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment the Czech, who was listening to the conversation, smiled\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n\"The truth will be known at the Mazowiecki court.\"\r\n\r\nSanderus looked at him for a while; then he said:\r\n\r\n\"Do you think that I am afraid of the Mazowiecki court?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not say you are afraid of the Mazowiecki court; but neither now,\r\nnor after three days will you go away with the horse. If it prove that\r\nyou were lying, then you will not be able to go on your feet either,\r\nbecause my lord will order me to break them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be sure of that!\" answered Zbyszko.\r\n\r\nSanderus now thought that it would be wiser to be more careful, and said:\r\n\r\n\"If I wanted to lie, I would have said immediately whether she was\r\nmarried or not; but I said: 'I don't remember.' If you had common sense,\r\nyou would recognize my virtue by that answer.\"\r\n\r\n\"My common sense is not a brother of your virtue, because that is the\r\nsister of a dog.\"\r\n\r\n\"My virtue does not bark, as your common sense does; and the one who\r\nbarks when alive, may howl after death.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is sure! Your virtue will not howl after your death; it will gnash\r\nits teeth, provided it does not lose its teeth in the service of the\r\ndevil while living.\" Thus they quarreled; the Czech's tongue was ready,\r\nand for every word of the German, he answered two. Zbyszko having asked\r\nabout the road to Lenczyca, ordered the retinue to move forward. Beyond\r\nSieradz, they entered thick forests which covered the greater part of the\r\ncountry; but the highways through these forests, had been paved with logs\r\nand ditches dug along the sides, by the order of King Kazimierz. It is\r\ntrue that after his death, during the disturbances of the war aroused by\r\nNalenczs and Grzymalits, the roads were neglected; but during Jadwiga's\r\nreign, when peace was restored to the kingdom, shovels were again busy in\r\nthe marshes, and axes in the forests; soon everywhere between the\r\nimportant cities, merchants could conduct their loaded wagons in safety.\r\nThe only danger was from wild beasts and robbers; but against the beasts,\r\nthey had lanterns for night, and crossbows for defence during the day;\r\nthen there were fewer highway robbers than in other countries, and one\r\nwho traveled with an armed retinue, need fear nothing.\r\n\r\nZbyszko was not afraid of robbers nor of armed knights; he did not even\r\nthink about them. But he was filled with great anxiety, and longed with\r\nhis whole soul to be at the Mazowiecki court. Would he find Danusia still\r\na lady-in-waiting of the princess, or the wife of some Mazowiecki knight?\r\nSometimes it seemed to him impossible that she should forget him; then\r\nsometimes he thought that perhaps Jurand went to the court from Spychow\r\nand married the girl to some neighbor or friend. Jurand had told him in\r\nKrakow, that he could not give Danusia to him; therefore it was evident\r\nthat he had promised her to somebody else; evidently he was bound by an\r\noath, and now he had fulfilled his promise. Zbyszko called Sanderus and\r\nquestioned him again; but the German prevaricated more and more.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Zbyszko was riding along, sad and unhappy. He did not think\r\nabout Bogdaniec, nor about Zgorzelice, but only how he should act. First,\r\nit was necessary to ascertain the truth at the Mazowiecki court;\r\ntherefore, he rode hastily, only stopping for a short time at the houses\r\nof noblemen, in the inns and in the cities to rest the horses. He had\r\nnever ceased to love Danusia; but while in Bogdaniec and Zgorzelice,\r\nchatting almost every day with Jagienka and admiring her beauty, he had\r\nnot thought about Danusia often. Now she was constantly in his thoughts,\r\nday and night. Even in his sleep, he saw her standing before him, with a\r\nlute in her hands and a garland on her head. She stretched her hands\r\ntoward him, and Jurand drew her away. In the morning, when the dreams\r\ndisappeared, a greater longing came, and he loved this girl more than\r\never now, when he was uncertain whether they had taken her from him or\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nSometimes he feared that they had married her against her will;\r\ntherefore, he was not angry with her, as she was only a child and could\r\nnot have her own will. But he was angry with Jurand and with Princess\r\nJanuszowna. He determined that he would not cease to serve her; even if\r\nhe found her somebody else's wife, he would deposit the peacocks' crests\r\nat her feet.\r\n\r\nSometimes he was consoled by the thought of a great war. He felt that\r\nduring the war, he would forget about everything and that he would escape\r\nall sorrows and griefs. The great war seemed suspended in the air. It was\r\nnot known whence the news came, because there was peace between the king\r\nand the Order; nevertheless, wherever Zbyszko went, nothing else was\r\ntalked about. The people had a presentiment that it would come, and some\r\nof them said openly: \"Why were we united with Litwa, if not against those\r\nwolves, the Knights of the Cross? Therefore we must finish with them once\r\nfor all, or they will destroy us.\" Others said: \"Crazy monks! They are\r\nnot satisfied with Plowce! Death is over them, and still they have taken\r\nthe land of Dobrzyn.\"\r\n\r\nIn all parts of the kingdom, they were making preparations, gravely,\r\nwithout boasting, as was customary for a fight for life or death; but\r\nwith the silent, deadly grudge of a mighty nation, which had suffered\r\nwrongs for a long time, and finally was ready to administer a terrible\r\npunishment. In all the houses of the nobility, Zbyszko met people who\r\nwere convinced that at any moment one might be obliged to mount his\r\nhorse. Zbyszko was pleased to see these hasty preparations which he met\r\nat every step. Everywhere other cares gave way to thoughts about horses\r\nand armor. Everywhere the people were gravely inspecting spears, swords,\r\naxes, helmets and javelins. The blacksmiths were busy day and night,\r\nhammering iron sheets and making heavy armor, which could hardly be\r\nlifted by the refined western knights, but which the strong noblemen of\r\nWielko and Malopolska could wear very easily. The old people were pulling\r\nout musty bags full of _grzywns_[92] from their chests, for the war\r\nexpedition of their children. Once Zbyszko passed the night in the house\r\nof a wealthy nobleman, Bartosz of Bielaw, who having twenty-two sturdy\r\nsons, pledged his numerous estates to the monastery in Lowicz, to\r\npurchase twenty-two suits of armor, the same number of helmets and\r\nweapons of war. Zbyszko now realized that it would be necessary to go to\r\nPrussia, and he thanked God that he was so well provided.\r\n\r\nMany thought that he was the son of a _wojewoda_; and when he told the\r\npeople that he was a simple nobleman, and that armor such as he wore,\r\ncould be bought from the Germans by paying for it with a good blow of an\r\naxe, their hearts were filled with enthusiasm for war. Many a knight\r\nseeing that armor, and desiring to possess it, followed Zbyszko, and\r\nsaid: \"Will you not fight for it?\"\r\n\r\nIn Mazowsze, the people did not talk so much about the war. They also\r\nbelieved that it would come, but they did not know when. In Warszawa\r\nthere was peace. The court was in Ciechanow, which Prince Janusz rebuilt\r\nafter the Lithuanian invasion; nothing of the old town remained, only the\r\ncastle.\r\n\r\nIn the city of Warszawa, Zbyszko was received by Jasko Socha, the\r\n_starosta_[93] of the castle, and the son of the _wojewoda_ Abraham, who\r\nwas killed at Worskla. Jasko knew Zbyszko, because he was with the\r\nprincess in Krakow; therefore he received him hospitably and with joy;\r\nbut the young man, before he began to eat or drink, asked Jasko about\r\nDanusia. But he did not know anything about her, because the prince and\r\nthe princess had been in Ciechanow since fall. In Warszawa there were\r\nonly a few archers and himself, to guard the castle. He had heard that\r\nthere had been feasts and weddings in Ciechanow; but he did not know\r\nwhich girls were married.\r\n\r\n\"But I think,\" said he, \"that Jurandowna is not married; it could not be\r\ndone without Jurand, and I have not heard of his arrival. There are two\r\nbrothers of the Order, _comthurs_, with the prince; one from Jansbork and\r\nthe other from Szczytno, and also some foreign guests; on such occasions,\r\nJurand never goes to the court, because the sight of a white mantle\r\nenrages him. If Jurand were not there, there would be no wedding! If you\r\nwish, I will send a messenger to ascertain and tell him to return,\r\nimmediately; but I firmly believe that you will find Jurandowna still a\r\ngirl.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am going there to-morrow myself; but may God reward you for your\r\nkindness. As soon as the horses are rested, I will go, because I shall\r\nhave no peace, until I know the truth.\"\r\n\r\nBut Socha was not satisfied with that, and inquired among the nobles and\r\nthe soldiers if they had heard about Jurandowna's wedding. But nobody had\r\nheard anything, although there were several among them who had been in\r\nCiechanow.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Zbyszko retired greatly relieved. While lying in bed he decided\r\nto get rid of Sanderus; but afterward he thought that the scoundrel might\r\nbe useful to him because he could speak German. Sanderus had not told him\r\na falsehood; and although he was a costly acquisition, because he ate and\r\ndrank as much as four men would in the inns, still he was serviceable,\r\nand showed some attachment for the young knight. Then he possessed the\r\nart of writing, and that gave him a superiority over the shield-bearer,\r\nthe Czech, and even over Zbyszko himself. Consequently Zbyszko permitted\r\nhim to accompany his retinue to Ciechanow. Sanderus was glad of this,\r\nbecause he noticed that being in respectable company, he won confidence\r\nand found purchasers for his wares more easily. After stopping one night\r\nin Nasielsk, riding neither too swiftly nor too slowly, they perceived\r\nnext day toward evening, the walls of the castle of Ciechanow. Zbyszko\r\nstopped in an inn to don his armor, so as to enter the castle according\r\nto knightly custom, with his helmet on his head and his spear in his\r\nhand; then he mounted his enormous stallion, and having made the sign of\r\nthe cross in the air, he rushed forward. He had gone only a short\r\ndistance, when the Czech who was riding behind him, drew near and said:\r\n\r\n\"Your Grace, some knights are coming behind us; they must be Krzyzaks.\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko turned and saw about half a furlong behind him, a splendid\r\nretinue at the head of which there were riding two knights on fine\r\nPomeranian horses, both in full armor, each of them wearing a white\r\nmantle with a black cross, and a helmet having a high crest of peacock's\r\nfeathers.\r\n\r\n\"For God's sake, Krzyzacy!\" said Zbyszko.\r\n\r\nInvoluntarily he leaned forward in his saddle and aimed his spear; seeing\r\nthis the Czech seized his axe. The other attendants being experienced in\r\nwar, were also ready, not for a fight, because the servants did not\r\nparticipate in single combat, but to measure the space for the fight on\r\nhorseback, or to level the ground for the fight on foot. The Czech alone,\r\nbeing a nobleman, was ready to fight; but he expected that Zbyszko would\r\nchallenge before he attacked, and he was surprised to see the young\r\nknight aim his spear before the challenge.\r\n\r\nBut Zbyszko came to his senses in time. He remembered how he attacked\r\nLichtenstein near Krakow, and all the misfortunes which followed;\r\ntherefore he raised the spear and handed it to the Czech. Without drawing\r\nhis sword, he galloped toward the Krzyzaks. When he came near them, he\r\nnoticed that there was a third knight, also with a peacock's crest on his\r\nhelmet, and a fourth, without armor, but having long hair, who seemed to\r\nbe a Mazur. Seeing them, he concluded that they must be some envoys to\r\nthe prince of Mazowiecki; therefore he said aloud:\r\n\r\n\"May Jesus Christ be praised!\"\r\n\r\n\"For ages and ages!\" answered the long-haired knight.\r\n\r\n\"May God speed you!\"\r\n\r\n\"And you also, sir!\"\r\n\r\n\"Glory be to St. George!\"\r\n\r\n\"He is our patron. You are welcome, sir.\"\r\n\r\nThen they began to bow; Zbyszko told his name, who he was, what his coat\r\nof arms was, what his war-cry was and whence he was going to the\r\nMazowiecki court. The long-haired knight said that his name was Jendrek\r\nof Kropiwnica and that he was conducting some guests to the prince;\r\nBrother Godfried, Brother Rotgier, also Sir Fulko de Lorche of\r\nLotaringen, who being with the Knights of the Cross, wished to see the\r\nprince and especially the princess, the daughter of the famous\r\n\"Kiejstut.\"\r\n\r\nWhile they were conversing, the foreign knights sat erect on their\r\nhorses, occasionally bending their heads which were covered with iron\r\nhelmets ornamented with peacocks' tufts. Judging from Zbyszko's splendid\r\narmor, they thought that the prince had sent some important personage,\r\nperhaps his own son, to meet them. Jendrek of Kropiwnica said further:\r\n\r\n\"The _comthur_, or as we would say the _starosta_ from Jansbork is at our\r\nprince's castle; he told the prince about these knights; that they\r\ndesired to visit him, but that they did not dare, especially this knight\r\nfrom Lotaringen, who being from a far country, thought that the Saracens\r\nlived right beyond the frontier of the Knights of the Cross, and that\r\nthere was continual war with them. The prince immediately sent me to the\r\nboundary, to conduct them safely to his castle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Could they not come without your help!\"\r\n\r\n\"Our nation is very angry with the Krzyzaks, because of their great\r\ntreacherousness; a Krzyzak will hug and kiss you, but he is ready in the\r\nsame moment to stab you with a knife from behind; and such conduct is\r\nodious to us Mazurs. Nevertheless anyone will receive even a German in\r\nhis house, and will not wrong his guest; but he would stop him on the\r\nroad. There are many who do this for vengeance, or for glory.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who among you is the most famous?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is one whom all Germans fear to meet; his name is Jurand of\r\nSpychow.\"\r\n\r\nThe heart of the young knight throbbed when he heard that name;\r\nimmediately he determined to question Jendrek of Kropiwnica.\r\n\r\n\"I know!\" said he; \"I heard about him; his daughter Danuta was\r\ngirl-in-waiting with the princess; afterward she was married.\"\r\n\r\nHaving said this, he looked sharply into the eyes of the Mazowiecki\r\nknight, who answered with great astonishment:\r\n\r\n\"Who told you that? She is very young yet. It is true that it sometimes\r\nhappens that very young girls are married, but Jurandowna is not married.\r\nI left Ciechanow six days ago and I saw her then with the princess. How\r\ncould she marry during advent?\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko having heard this, wanted to seize the knight by the neck and\r\nshout: \"May God reward you for the news!\" but he controlled himself, and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"I heard that Jurand gave her to some one.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was the princess who wished to give her, but she could not do it\r\nagainst Jurand's will. She wanted to give her to a knight in Krakow, who\r\nmade a vow to the girl, and whom she loves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does she love him?\" exclaimed Zbyszko.\r\n\r\nAt this Jendrek looked sharply at him, smiled and said:\r\n\r\n\"Do you know, you are too inquisitive about that girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am asking about my friend to whom I am going.\"\r\n\r\nOne could hardly see Zbyszko's face under the helmet; but his nose and\r\ncheeks were so red that the Mazur, who was fond of joking, said:\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid that the cold makes your face red!\"\r\n\r\nThen the young man grew still more confused, and answered:\r\n\r\n\"It must be that.\"\r\n\r\nThey moved forward and rode silently for some time; but after a while\r\nJendrek of Kropiwnica asked:\r\n\r\n\"What do they call you? I did not hear distinctly?\"\r\n\r\n\"Zbyszko of Bogdaniec.\"\r\n\r\n\"For heaven's sake! The knight who made a vow to Jurandowna, had the same\r\nname.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think that I shall deny that I am he?\" answered Zbyszko, proudly.\r\n\r\n\"There is no reason for doing so. Gracious Lord, then you are that\r\nZbyszko whom the girl covered with her veil! After the retinue returned\r\nfrom Krakow, the women of the court talked about nothing else, and many\r\nof them cried while listening to the story. Then you are he! Hej! how\r\nhappy they will be to see you at the court; even the princess is very\r\nfond of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"May the Lord bless her, and you also for the good news. I suffered\r\ngreatly when I heard that Danusia was married.\"\r\n\r\n\"She is not married! Although she will inherit Spychow, and there are\r\nmany handsome youths at the court, yet not one of them looks into her\r\neyes, because all respect your vow; then the princess would not permit\r\nit. Hej! there will be great joy. Sometimes they teased the girl! Some\r\none would tell her: 'Your knight will not come back!' Then she would\r\nreply: 'He will be back! He will be back!' Sometimes they told her that\r\nyou had married another; then she cried.\"\r\n\r\nThese words made Zbyszko feel very tender; he also felt angry because\r\nDanusia had been vexed; therefore he said:\r\n\r\n\"I shall challenge those who said such things about me!\"\r\n\r\nJendrek of Kropiwnica began to laugh and said:\r\n\r\n\"The women teased her! Will you challenge a woman? You cannot do anything\r\nwith a sword against a distaff.\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko was pleased that he had met such a cheerful companion; he began\r\nto ask Jendrek about Danusia. He also inquired about the customs of the\r\nMazowiecki court, about Prince Janusz, and about the princess. Finally he\r\ntold what he had heard about the war during his journey, and how the\r\npeople were making preparations for it, and were expecting it every day.\r\nHe asked whether the people in the principalities of Mazowsze, thought it\r\nwould soon come.\r\n\r\nThe heir of Kropiwnica did not think that the war was near. The people\r\nsaid that it could not be avoided; but he had heard the prince himself\r\nsay to Mikolaj of Dlugolas, that the Knights of the Cross were very\r\npeaceable now, and if the king only insisted, they would restore the\r\nprovince of Dobrzyn to Poland; or they would try to delay the whole\r\naffair, until they were well prepared,\r\n\r\n\"The prince went to Malborg a short time ago,\" said he, \"where during the\r\nabsence of the grand master, the grand marshal received him and\r\nentertained him with great hospitality; now there are some _comthurs_\r\nhere, and other guests are coming.\"\r\n\r\nHere he stopped for a while, and then added:\r\n\r\n\"The people say that the Krzyzaks have a purpose in coming here and in\r\ngoing to Plock to the court of Prince Ziemowit. They would like to have\r\nthe princes pledge themselves not to help the king but to aid them; or if\r\nthey do not agree to help the Krzyzaks, that at least they will remain\r\nneutral; but the princes will not do that.\"\r\n\r\n\"God will not permit it. Would you stay home? Your princes belong to the\r\nkingdom of Poland!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, we would not stay home,\" answered Jendrek of Kropiwnica.\r\n\r\nZbyszko again glanced at the foreign knights, and at their peacocks'\r\ntufts, and asked:\r\n\r\n\"Are these knights going for that purpose?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are brothers of the Order and perhaps that is their motive. Who\r\nunderstands them?\"\r\n\r\n\"And that third one?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is going because he is inquisitive.\"\r\n\r\n\"He must be some famous knight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah! three heavily laden wagons follow him, and he has nine men in his\r\nescort. I would like to fight with such a man!\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you not do it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course not! The prince commanded me to guard them. Not one hair shall\r\nfall from their heads until they reach Ciechanow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose I challenge them? Perhaps they would desire to fight with me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you would be obliged to fight with me first, because I will not\r\npermit you to fight with them while I live.\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko looked at the young nobleman in a friendly way, and said:\r\n\r\n\"You understand what knightly honor is. I shall not fight with you,\r\nbecause I am your friend; but in Ciechanow, God will help me to find some\r\npretext for a challenge to the Germans.\"\r\n\r\n\"In Ciechanow you can do what you please. I am sure there will be\r\ntournaments; then you can fight, if the prince and the _comthurs_ give\r\npermission.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have a board on which is written a challenge for anyone who will not\r\naffirm that _Panna_ Danuta Jurandowna is the most virtuous and the most\r\nbeautiful girl in the world; but everywhere the people shrugged their\r\nshoulders and laughed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Because it is a foreign custom; and speaking frankly, a stupid one which\r\nis not known in our country, except near the boundaries. That Lotaringer\r\ntried to pick a quarrel with some noblemen, asking them to praise some\r\nlady of his; but nobody could understand him, and I would not let them\r\nfight.\"\r\n\r\n\"What? He wanted to praise his lady? For God's sake!\"\r\n\r\nHe looked closely at the foreign knight, and saw that his young face was\r\nfull of sadness, he also perceived with astonishment that the knight had\r\na rope made of hairs round his neck.\r\n\r\n\"Why does he wear that rope?\" asked Zbyszko.\r\n\r\n\"I could not find out, because they do not understand our language,\r\nBrother Rotgier can say a few words, but not very well either. But I\r\nthink that this young knight has made a vow to wear that rope until he\r\nhas accomplished some knightly deed. During the day, he wears it outside\r\nof his armor, but during the night, on the bare flesh.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sanderus!\" called Zbyszko, suddenly\r\n\r\n\"At your service,\" answered the German, approaching\r\n\r\n\"Ask this knight, who is the most virtuous and the most beautiful girl in\r\nthe world.\"\r\n\r\nSanderus repeated the question in German.\r\n\r\n\"Ulryka von Elner!\" answered Fulko de Lorche.\r\n\r\nThen he raised his eyes and began to sigh. Zbyszko hearing this answer,\r\nwas indignant, and reined in his stallion; but before he could reply,\r\nJendrek of Kropiwnica, pushed his horse between him and the foreigner,\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n\"You shall not quarrel here!\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko turned to Sanderus and said:\r\n\r\n\"Tell him that I say that he is in love with an owl.\"\r\n\r\n\"Noble knight, my master says that you are in love with an owl!\" repeated\r\nSanderus, like an echo.\r\n\r\nAt this Sir de Lorche dropped his reins, drew the iron gauntlet from his\r\nright hand and threw it in the snow in front of Zbyszko, who motioned to\r\nthe Czech to lift it with the point of his spear.\r\n\r\nJendrek of Kropiwnica, turned toward Zbyszko with a threatening face, and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"You shall not fight; I shall permit neither of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not challenge him; he challenged me.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you called his lady an owl. Enough of this! I also know how to use a\r\nsword.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I do not wish to fight with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will be obliged to, because I have sworn to defend the other\r\nknight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then what shall I do?\" asked Zbyszko.\r\n\r\n\"Wait; we are near Ciechanow.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what will the German think?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your servant must explain to him that he cannot fight here; that first\r\nyou must receive the prince's permission, and he, the _comthur's_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah! suppose they will not give permission.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you will find each other. Enough of this talk.\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko, seeing that he could not do otherwise, because Jendrek of\r\nKropiwnica would not permit them to fight, called Sanderus, and told him\r\nto explain to the Lotaringer knight, that they could fight only in\r\nCiechanow. De Lorche having listened, nodded to signify that he\r\nunderstood; then having stretched his hand toward Zbyszko, he pressed the\r\npalm three times, which according to the knightly custom, meant that they\r\nmust fight, no matter when or where. Then in an apparent good\r\nunderstanding, they moved on toward the castle of Ciechanow, whose towers\r\none could see reflected on the pink sky.\r\n\r\nIt was daylight when they arrived; but after they announced themselves at\r\nthe gate, it was dark before the bridge was lowered. They were received\r\nby Zbyszko's former acquaintance, Mikolaj of Dlugolas, who commanded the\r\ngarrison consisting of a few knights and three hundred of the famous\r\narchers of Kurpie.[94] To his great sorrow, Zbyszko learned that the\r\ncourt was absent. The prince wishing to honor the _comthurs_ of Szczytno\r\nand Jansbork, arranged for them a great hunting party in the Krupiecka\r\nwilderness; the princess, with her ladies-in-waiting went also, to give\r\nmore importance to the occasion. Ofka, the widow of Krzych[95] of\r\nJarzombkow, was key-keeper, and the only woman in the castle whom Zbyszko\r\nknew. She was very glad to see him. Since her return from Krakow, she had\r\ntold everybody about his love for Danusia, and the incident about\r\nLichtenstein. These stories made her very popular among the younger\r\nladies and girls of the court; therefore she was fond of Zbyszko. She now\r\ntried to console the young man in his sorrow, caused by Danusia's\r\nabsence.\r\n\r\n\"You will not recognize her,\" she said. \"She is growing older, and is a\r\nlittle girl no longer; she loves you differently, also. You say your\r\nuncle is well? Why did he not come with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will let my horses rest for a while and then I will go to Danusia. I\r\nwill go during the night,\" answered Zbyszko.\r\n\r\n\"Do so, but take a guide from the castle, or you will be lost in the\r\nwilderness.\"\r\n\r\nIn fact after supper, which Mikolaj of Dlugolas ordered to be served to\r\nthe guests, Zbyszko expressed his desire to go after the prince, and he\r\nasked for a guide. The brothers of the Order, wearied by the journey,\r\napproached the enormous fireplaces in which were burning the entire\r\ntrunks of pine trees, and said that they would go the next day. But de\r\nLorche expressed his desire to go with Zbyszko, saying that otherwise he\r\nmight miss the hunting party, and he wished to see them very much. Then\r\nhe approached Zbyszko, and having extended his hand, he again pressed his\r\nfingers three times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nMikolaj of Dlugolas having learned from Jendrek of Kropiwnica about the\r\nchallenge, required both Zbyszko and the other knight to give him their\r\nknightly word that they would not fight without the prince and the\r\n_comthur's_ permission; if they refused, he said he would shut the gates\r\nand not permit them to leave the castle. Zbyszko wished to see Danusia as\r\nsoon as possible, consequently he did not resist; de Lorche, although\r\nwilling to fight when necessary, was not a bloodthirsty man, therefore he\r\nswore upon his knightly honor, to wait for the prince's consent. He did\r\nit willingly, because having heard so many songs about tournaments and\r\nbeing fond of pompous feasts, he preferred to fight in the presence of\r\nthe court, the dignitaries and the ladies; he believed that such a\r\nvictory would bring greater renown, and he would win the golden spurs\r\nmore easily. Then he was also anxious to become acquainted with the\r\ncountry and the people, therefore he preferred a delay. Mikolaj of\r\nDlugolas, who had been in captivity among the Germans a long time, and\r\ncould speak the language easily, began to tell him marvelous tales about\r\nthe prince's hunting parties for different kinds of beasts not known in\r\nthe western countries. Therefore Zbyszko and he left the castle about\r\nmidnight, and went toward Przasnysz, having with them their armed\r\nretinues, and men with lanterns to protect them against the wolves, which\r\ngathering during the winter in innumerable packs, it was dangerous even\r\nfor several well armed cavaliers to meet. On this side of Ciechanow there\r\nwere deep forests, which a short distance beyond Przasnysz were merged\r\ninto the enormous Kurpiecka wilderness, which on the west joined the\r\nimpassable forest of Podlasie, and further on Lithuania. Through these\r\nforests the Lithuanian barbarians came to Mazowsze, and in 1337 reached\r\nCiechanow, which they burned. De Lorche listened with the greatest\r\ninterest to the stories, told him by the old guide, Macko of Turoboje. He\r\ndesired to fight with the Lithuanians, whom as many other western knights\r\ndid, he had thought were Saracens. In fact he had come on a crusade,\r\nwishing to gain fame and salvation. He thought that a war with the\r\nMazurs, half heathenish people, would secure for him entire pardon.\r\nTherefore he could scarcely believe his own eyes, when having reached\r\nMazowsze, he saw churches in the towns, crosses on the towers, priests,\r\nknights with holy signs on their armor and the people, very daring\r\nindeed, and ready for a fight, but Christian and not more rapacious than\r\nthe Germans, among whom the young knight had traveled. Therefore, when he\r\nwas told that these people had confessed Christ for centuries, he did not\r\nknow what to think about the Knights of the Cross; and when he learned\r\nthat Lithuania was baptized by the command of the late queen, his\r\nsurprise and sorrow were boundless.\r\n\r\nHe began to inquire from Macko of Turoboje, if in the forest toward which\r\nthey were riding, there were any dragons to whom the people were obliged\r\nto sacrifice young girls, and with whom one could fight. But Macko's\r\nanswer greatly disappointed him.\r\n\r\n\"In the forest, there are many beasts, wolves, bisons and bears with\r\nwhich there is plenty of work,\" answered the Mazur. \"Perhaps in the\r\nswamps there are some unclean spirits; but I never heard about dragons,\r\nand even if they were there, we would not give them girls, but we would\r\ndestroy them. Bah! had there been any, the Kurpie would have worn belts\r\nof their skins long ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"What kind of people are they; is it possible to fight with them?\" asked\r\nde Lorche.\r\n\r\n\"One can fight with them, but it is not desirable,\" answered Macko; \"and\r\nthen it is not proper for a knight, because they are peasants.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Swiss are peasants also. Do they confess Christ?\"\r\n\r\n\"There are no such people in Mazowsze. They are our people. Did you see\r\nthe archers in the castles? They are all the Kurpie, because there are no\r\nbetter archers than they are.\"\r\n\r\n\"They cannot be better than the Englishmen and the Scotch, whom I saw at\r\nthe Burgundian court.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have seen them also in Malborg,\" interrupted the Mazur. \"They are\r\nstrong, but they cannot compare with the Kurpie, among whom a boy seven\r\nyears old, will not be allowed to eat, until he has knocked the food with\r\nan arrow from the summit of a pine.\"\r\n\r\n\"About what are you talking?\" suddenly asked Zbyszko, who had heard the\r\nword \"Kurpie\" several times.\r\n\r\n\"About the English and the Kurpiecki archers. This knight says that the\r\nEnglish and the Scotch are the best.\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw them at Wilno. Owa! I heard their darts passing my ears. There\r\nwere knights there from all countries, and they announced that they would\r\neat us up without salt; but after they tried once or twice, they lost\r\ntheir appetite.\"\r\n\r\nMacko laughed and repeated Zbyszko's words to Sir de Lorche.\r\n\r\n\"I have heard about that at different courts,\" answered the Lotaringer;\r\n\"they praised your knights' bravery, but they blamed them because they\r\nhelped the heathen against the Knights of the Cross.\"\r\n\r\n\"We defended the nation which wished to be baptized, against invasion and\r\nwrong. The Germans wished to keep them in idolatry, so as to have a\r\npretext for war.\"\r\n\r\n\"God shall judge them,\" answered de Lorche.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps He will judge them soon,\" answered Macko of Turoboje.\r\n\r\nBut the Lotaringer having heard that Zbyszko had been at Wilno, began to\r\nquestion Macko, because the fame of the knightly combats fought there,\r\nhad spread widely throughout the world. That duel, fought by four Polish\r\nand four French knights, especially excited the imagination of western\r\nwarriors. The consequence was that de Lorche began to look at Zbyszko\r\nwith more respect, as upon a man who had participated in such a famous\r\nbattle; he also rejoiced that he was going to fight with such a knight.\r\n\r\nTherefore they rode along apparently good friends, rendering each other\r\nsmall services during the time for refreshment on the journey and\r\ntreating each other with wine. But when it appeared from the conversation\r\nbetween de Lorche and Macko of Turoboje, that Ulryka von Elner was not a\r\nyoung girl, but a married woman forty years old and having six children,\r\nZbyszko became indignant, because this foreigner dared not only to\r\ncompare an old woman with Danusia, but even asked him to acknowledge her\r\nto be the first among women.\r\n\r\n\"Do you not think,\" said he to Macko, \"that an evil spirit has turned his\r\nbrain? Perhaps the devil is sitting in his head like a worm in a nut and\r\nis ready to jump on one of us during the night. We must be on our guard.\"\r\n\r\nMacko of Turoboje began to look at the Lotaringer with a certain\r\nuneasiness and finally said:\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes it happens that there are hundreds of devils in a possessed\r\nman, and if they are crowded, they are glad to go in other people. The\r\nworst devil is the one sent by a woman.\"\r\n\r\nThen he turned suddenly to the knight:\r\n\r\n\"May Jesus Christ be praised!\"\r\n\r\n\"I praise him also,\" answered de Lorche, with some astonishment.\r\n\r\nMacko was completely reassured.\r\n\r\n\"No, don't you see,\" said he, \"if the devil were dwelling in him, he\r\nwould have foamed immediately, or he would have been thrown to the earth,\r\nbecause I asked him suddenly. We can go.\"\r\n\r\nIn fact, they proceeded quietly. The distance between Ciechanow and\r\nPrzasnysz is not great, and during the summer a cavalier riding a good\r\nhorse can travel from one city to the other in two hours; but they were\r\nriding very slowly on account of the darkness and the drifts of snow.\r\nThey started after midnight and did not arrive at the prince's hunting\r\nhouse, situated near the woods, beyond Przasnysz, until daybreak. The\r\nwooden mansion was large and the panes of the windows were made of glass\r\nballs. In front of the house were the well-sweeps and two barns for\r\nhorses, and round the mansion were many tents made of skins and booths\r\nhastily built of the branches of pine trees. The fires shone brightly in\r\nfront of the tents, and round them were standing the huntsmen who were\r\ndressed in coats made of sheepskins, foxskins, wolfskins and bearskins,\r\nand having the hair turned outside. It seemed to Sir de Lorche that he\r\nsaw some wild beasts standing on two legs, because the majority of these\r\nmen had caps made of the heads of animals. Some of them were standing,\r\nleaning on their spears or crossbows; others were busy winding enormous\r\nnets made of ropes; others were turning large pieces of urus and elk meat\r\nwhich was hanging over the fire, evidently preparing for breakfast.\r\nBehind them were the trunks of enormous pines and more people; the great\r\nnumber of people astonished the Lotaringer who was not accustomed to see\r\nsuch large hunting parties.\r\n\r\n\"Your princes,\" said he, \"go to a hunt as if to a war.\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure,\" answered Macko of Turoboje; \"they lack neither hunting\r\nimplements nor people.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are we going to do?\" interrupted Zbyszko; \"they are still asleep in\r\nthe mansion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we must wait until they get up,\" answered Macko; \"we cannot knock\r\nat the door and awaken the prince, our lord.\"\r\n\r\nHaving said this, he conducted them to a fire, near which the Kurpie\r\nthrew some wolfskins and urusskins, and then offered them some roasted\r\nmeat. Hearing a foreign speech, the people began to gather round to see\r\nthe German. Soon the news was spread by Zbyszko's attendants that there\r\nwas a knight \"from beyond the seas,\" and the crowd became so great that\r\nthe lord of Turoboje was obliged to use his authority to shield the\r\nforeigner from their curiosity. De Lorche noticed some women in the crowd\r\nalso dressed in skins, but very beautiful; he inquired whether they also\r\nparticipated in the hunt.\r\n\r\nMacko explained to him that they did not take part in the hunting, but\r\nonly came to satisfy their womanly curiosity, or to purchase the products\r\nof the towns and to sell the riches of the forest. The court of the\r\nprince was like a fireplace, round which were concentrated two\r\nelements--rural and civic. The Kurpie disliked to leave their wilderness,\r\nbecause they felt uneasy without the rustling of the trees above their\r\nheads; therefore the inhabitants of Przasnysz brought their famous beer,\r\ntheir flour ground in wind mills or water mills built on the river\r\nWengierka, salt which was very rare in the wilderness, iron, leather and\r\nother fruits of human industry, taking in exchange skins, costly furs,\r\ndried mushrooms, nuts, herbs, good in case of sickness, or clods of amber\r\nwhich were plentiful among the Kurpie. Therefore round the prince's court\r\nthere was the noise of a continual market, increased during the hunting\r\nparties, because duty and curiosity attracted the inhabitants from the\r\ndepths of the forests.\r\n\r\nDe Lorche listened to Macko, looking with curiosity at the people, who,\r\nliving in the healthy resinous air and eating much meat as was the custom\r\nwith the majority of the peasants in those days, astonished the foreign\r\ntravelers by their strength and size. Zbyszko was continually looking at\r\nthe doors and windows of the mansion, hardly able to remain quiet. There\r\nwas light in one window only, evidently in the kitchen, because steam was\r\ncoming out through the gapes between the panes.\r\n\r\nIn the small doors, situated in the side of the house, servants in the\r\nprince's livery appeared from time to time, hurrying to the wells for\r\nwater. These men being asked if everybody was still sleeping, answered\r\nthat the court, wearied by the previous day's hunting, was still resting,\r\nbut that breakfast was being prepared. In fact through the window of the\r\nkitchen, there now issued the smell of roasted meat and saffron,\r\nspreading far among the fires. Finally the principal door was opened,\r\nshowing the interior of a brightly lighted hall, and on the piazza\r\nappeared a man whom Zbyszko immediately recognized as one of the\r\n_rybalts_, whom he had seen with the princess in Krakow. Having perceived\r\nhim, and waiting neither for Macko of Turoboje, nor for de Lorche,\r\nZbyszko rushed with such an impetus toward the mansion, that the\r\nastonished Lotaringer asked:\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter with the young knight?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing the matter with him,\" answered Macko of Turoboje; \"he\r\nis in love with a girl of the princess' court and he wants to see her as\r\nsoon as possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" answered de Lorche, putting both of his hands on his heart. He\r\nbegan to sigh so deeply that Macko shrugged his shoulders and said to\r\nhimself:\r\n\r\n\"Is it possible that he is sighing for that old woman? It may be that his\r\nsenses are impaired!\"\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile he conducted de Lorche into the large hall of the\r\nmansion which was ornamented with the horns of bisons, elks and deer, and\r\nwas lighted by the large logs burning in the fireplace. In the middle of\r\nthe hall stood a table covered with _kilimek_[96] and dishes for\r\nbreakfast; there were only a few courtiers present, with whom Zbyszko was\r\ntalking. Macko of Turoboje introduced Sir de Lorche to them. More\r\ncourtiers were coming at every moment; the majority of them were fine\r\nlooking men, with broad shoulders and fallow hair; all were dressed for\r\nhunting. Those who were acquainted with Zbyszko and were familiar with\r\nhis adventure in Krakow, greeted him as an old friend--it was evident\r\nthat they liked him. One of them said to him:\r\n\r\n\"The princess is here and Jurandowna also; you will see her soon, my dear\r\nboy; then you will go with us to the hunting party.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment the two guests of the prince, the Knights of the Cross,\r\nentered: brother Hugo von Danveld, _starosta_ of Ortelsburg,[97] and\r\nZygfried von Löve, bailiff of Jansbork. The first was quite a young man,\r\nbut stout, having a face like a beer drunkard, with thick, moist lips;\r\nthe other was tall with stern but noble features. It seemed to Zbyszko\r\nthat he had seen Danveld before at the court of Prince Witold and that\r\nHenryk, bishop of Plock, had thrown him from his horse during the combat\r\nin the lists. These reminiscences were disturbed by the entrance of\r\nPrince Janusz, whom the Knights of the Cross and the courtiers saluted.\r\nDe Lorche, the _comthurs_ and Zbyszko also approached him, and he\r\nwelcomed them cordially but with dignity. Immediately the trumpets\r\nresounded, announcing that the prince was going to breakfast; they\r\nresounded three times; and the third time, a large door to the right was\r\nopened and Princess Anna appeared, accompanied by the beautiful blonde\r\ngirl who had a lute hanging on her shoulder.\r\n\r\nZbyszko immediately stepped forward and kneeled on both knees in a\r\nposition full of worship and admiration. Seeing this, those present began\r\nto whisper, because Zbyszko's action surprised the Mazurs and some of\r\nthem were even scandalized. Some of the older ones said: \"Surely he\r\nlearned such customs from some knights living beyond the sea, or perhaps\r\neven from the heathen themselves, because there is no custom like it even\r\namong the Germans.\" But the younger ones said: \"No wonder, she saved his\r\nlife.\" But the princess and Jurandowna did not recognize Zbyszko at once,\r\nbecause he kneeled with his back toward the fire and his face was in the\r\nshadow. The princess thought that it was some courtier, who, having been\r\nguilty of some offence, besought her intervention with the prince; but\r\nDanusia having keener sight, advanced one step, and having bent her fair\r\nhead, cried suddenly:\r\n\r\n\"Zbyszko!\"\r\n\r\nThen forgetting that the whole court and the foreign guests were looking\r\nat her, she sprang like a roe toward the young knight and encircling his\r\nneck with her arms, began to kiss his mouth and his cheeks, nestling to\r\nhim and caressing him so long that the Mazurs laughed and the princess\r\ndrew her back.\r\n\r\nThen Zbyszko embraced the feet of the princess; she welcomed him, and\r\nasked about Macko, whether he was alive or not, and if alive whether he\r\nhad accompanied Zbyszko. Finally when the servants brought in warm\r\ndishes, she said to Zbyszko:\r\n\r\n\"Serve us, dear little knight, and perhaps not only now at the table, but\r\nforever.\"\r\n\r\nDanusia was blushing and confused, but was so beautiful, that not only\r\nZbyszko but all the knights present were filled with pleasure; the\r\n_starosta_ of Szczytno, put the palm of his hands to his thick, moist\r\nlips; de Lorche was amazed, and asked:\r\n\r\n\"By Saint Jacob of Compostella, who is that girl?\"\r\n\r\nTo this the _starosta_ of Szczytno, who was short, stood on his toes and\r\nwhispered in the ear of the Lotaringer:\r\n\r\n\"The devil's daughter.\"\r\n\r\nDe Lorche looked at him; then he frowned and began to say through his\r\nnose:\r\n\r\n\"A knight who talks against beauty is not gallant.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wear golden spurs, and I am a monk,\" answered Hugo von Danveld,\r\nproudly.\r\n\r\nThe Lotaringer dropped his head; but after awhile he said:\r\n\r\n\"I am a relative of the princess of Brabant.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Pax! Pax!_\" answered the Knight of the Cross. \"Honor to the mighty\r\nknights and friends of the Order from whom, sir, you shall soon receive\r\nyour golden spurs. I do not disparage the beauty of that girl; but\r\nlisten, I will tell you who is her father.\"\r\n\r\nBut he did not have time to tell him, because at that moment, Prince\r\nJanusz seated himself at the table; and having learned before from the\r\nbailiff of Jansbork about the mighty relatives of Sir de Lorche, he\r\ninvited him to sit beside him. The princess and Danusia were seated\r\nopposite. Zbyszko stood as he did in Krakow, behind their chairs, to\r\nserve them. Danusia held her head as low as possible over the plate,\r\nbecause she was ashamed. Zbyszko looked with ecstasy at her little head\r\nand pink cheeks; and he felt his love, like a river, overflowing his\r\nwhole breast. He could also feel her sweet kisses on his face, his eyes\r\nand his mouth. Formerly she used to kiss him as a sister kisses a\r\nbrother, and he received the kisses as from a child. Now Danusia seemed\r\nto him older and more mature--in fact she had grown and blossomed. Love\r\nwas so much talked about in her presence, that as a flower bud warmed by\r\nthe sun, takes color and expands, so her eyes were opened to love;\r\nconsequently there was a certain charm in her now, which formerly she\r\nlacked, and a strong intoxicating attraction beamed from her like the\r\nwarm beams from the sun, or the fragrance from the rose.\r\n\r\nZbyszko felt it, but he could not explain it to himself. He even forgot\r\nthat at the table one must serve. He did not see that the courtiers were\r\nlaughing at him and Danusia. Neither did he notice Sir de Lorche's face,\r\nwhich expressed great astonishment, nor the covetous eyes of the\r\n_starosta_ from Szczytno, who was gazing constantly at Danusia. He\r\nawakened only when the trumpets again sounded giving notice that it was\r\ntime to go into the wilderness, and when the princess Anna Danuta,\r\nturning toward him said:\r\n\r\n\"You will accompany us; you will then have an opportunity to speak to\r\nDanusia about your love.\"\r\n\r\nHaving said this, she went out with Danusia to dress for the ride on\r\nhorseback. Zbyszko rushed to the court-yard, where the horses covered\r\nwith frost were standing. There was no longer a great crowd, because the\r\nmen whose duty it was to hem in the beasts, had already gone forward into\r\nthe wilderness with the nets. The fires were quenched; the day was bright\r\nbut cold. Soon the prince appeared and mounted his horse; behind him was\r\nan attendant with a crossbow and a spear so long and heavy, that very few\r\ncould handle it; but the prince used it very easily, because like the\r\nother Mazovian Piasts, he was very strong. There were even women in that\r\nfamily so strong that they could roll iron axes,[98] between their\r\nfingers. The prince was also attended by two men, who were prepared to\r\nhelp him in any emergency: they had been chosen from among the landowners\r\nof the provinces of Warszawa and Ciechanow; they had shoulders like the\r\ntrunks of oak trees. Sir de Lorche gazed at them with amazement.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, the princess and Danusia came out; both wore hoods made\r\nof the skins of white weasels. This worthy daughter of Kiejstut could\r\n_stitch_ with a bow better than with a needle; therefore her attendants\r\ncarried a crossbow behind her. Zbyszko having kneeled on the snow,\r\nextended the palm of his hand, on which the princess rested her foot\r\nwhile mounting her horse; then he lifted Danusia into her saddle and they\r\nall started. The retinue stretched in a long column, turned to the right\r\nfrom the mansion, and then began slowly to enter the forest.\r\n\r\nThen the princess turned to Zbyszko and said:\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you talk? Speak to her.\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko, although thus encouraged, was still silent for a moment; but,\r\nafter quite a long silence, he said:\r\n\r\n\"Danuska!\"\r\n\r\n\"What, Zbyszku?\"\r\n\r\n\"I love you!\"\r\n\r\nHere he again stopped, searching for words which he could not find;\r\nalthough he kneeled before the girl like a foreign knight, and showed her\r\nhis respect in every way, still he could not express his love in words.\r\nTherefore he said:\r\n\r\n\"My love for you is so great that it stops my breathing.\"\r\n\r\n\"I also love you, Zbyszku!\" said she, hastily.\r\n\r\n\"Hej, my dearest! hej, my sweet girl\" exclaimed Zbyszko. \"Hej!\" Then he\r\nwas silent, full of blissful emotion; but the good-hearted and curious\r\nprincess helped them again.\r\n\r\n\"Tell her,\" said she, \"how lonesome you were without her, and when we\r\ncome to a thicket, you may kiss her; that will be the best proof of your\r\nlove.\"\r\n\r\nTherefore he began to tell how lonesome he was without her in Bogdaniec,\r\nwhile taking care of Macko and visiting among the neighbors. But the\r\ncunning fellow did not say a word about Jagienka. When the first thicket\r\nseparated them from the courtiers and the guests, he bent toward her and\r\nkissed her.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter there are no leaves on the hazel bushes, therefore Hugo\r\nvon Danveld and Sir de Lorche saw him kiss the girl; some of the\r\ncourtiers also saw him and they began to say among themselves:\r\n\r\n\"He kissed her in the presence of the princess! The lady will surely\r\nprepare the wedding for them soon.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is a daring boy, but Jurand's blood is warm also!\"\r\n\r\n\"They are flint-stone and fire-steel, although the girl looks so quiet.\r\nDo not be afraid, there will be some sparks from them!\"\r\n\r\nThus they talked and laughed; but the _starosta_ of Szczytno turned his\r\nevil face toward Sir de Lorche and asked:\r\n\r\n\"Sir, would you like some Merlin to change you by his magic power into\r\nthat knight?\"[99]\r\n\r\n\"Would you, sir?\" asked de Lorche.\r\n\r\nTo this the Knight of the Cross, who evidently was filled with jealousy,\r\ndrew the reins of his horse impatiently, and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Upon my soul!\"\r\n\r\nBut at that moment he recovered his composure, and having bent his head,\r\nhe said:\r\n\r\n\"I am a monk and have made a vow of chastity.\"\r\n\r\nHe glanced quickly at the Lotaringer, fearing he would perceive a smile\r\non his face, because in that respect the Order had a bad reputation among\r\nthe people; and of all among the monks, Hugo von Danveld had the worst. A\r\nfew years previous he had been vice-bailiff of Sambia. There were so many\r\ncomplaints against him there that, notwithstanding the tolerance with\r\nwhich the Order looked upon similar cases in Marienburg, the grand master\r\nwas obliged to remove him and appoint him _starosta_ of the garrison in\r\nSzczytno. Afterward he was sent to the prince's court on some secret\r\nmission, and having perceived the beautiful Jurandowna, he conceived a\r\nviolent passion for her, to which even Danusia's extreme youth was no\r\ncheck. But Danveld also knew to what family the girl belonged, and\r\nJurand's name was united in his memory with a painful reminiscence.\r\n\r\nDe Lorche began to question him:\r\n\r\n\"Sir, you called that beautiful girl the devil's daughter; why did you\r\ncall her that?\"\r\n\r\nDanveld began to relate the story of Zlotorja: how during the restoration\r\nof the castle, they captured the prince with the court, and how during\r\nthat fight Jurandowna's mother died; how since that time Jurand avenged\r\nhimself on all the Knights of the Cross. Danveld's hatred was apparent\r\nduring the narration, because he also had some personal reasons for\r\nhating Jurand. Two years before, during an encounter, he met Jurand; but\r\nthe mere sight of that dreadful \"Boar of Spychow\" so terrified him for\r\nthe first time in his life that he deserted two of his relatives and his\r\nretinue, and fled to Szczytno. For this cowardly act the grand marshal of\r\nthe Order brought a knightly suit against him; he swore that his horse\r\nhad become unmanageable and had carried him away from the battlefield;\r\nbut that incident shut his way to all higher positions in the Order. Of\r\ncourse Danveld did not say anything to Sir de Lorche about that\r\noccurrence, but instead he complained so bitterly about Jurand's\r\natrocities and the audacity of the whole Polish nation, that the\r\nLotaringer could not comprehend all he was saying, and said:\r\n\r\n\"But we are in the country of the Mazurs and not of the Polaks.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is an independent principality but the same nation,\" answered the\r\n_starosta_; \"they feel the same hatred against the Order. May God permit\r\nthe German swords to exterminate all this race!\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right, sir; I never heard even among the heathen of such an\r\nunlawful deed, as the building of a castle on somebody else's land, as\r\nthis prince tried to do,\" said de Lorche.\r\n\r\n\"He built the castle against us, but Zlotorja is situated on his land,\r\nnot on ours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then glory be to Christ that he granted you the victory! What was the\r\nresult of the war?\"\r\n\r\n\"There was no war then?\"\r\n\r\n\"What was the meaning of your victory at Zlotorja?\"\r\n\r\n\"God favored us; the prince had no army with him, only his court and the\r\nwomen.\"\r\n\r\nHere de Lorche looked at the Knight of the Cross with amazement.\r\n\r\n\"What? During the time of peace you attacked the women and the prince,\r\nwho was building a castle on his own land?\"\r\n\r\n\"For the glory of the Order and of Christendom.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that dreadful knight is seeking vengeance only for the death of his\r\nyoung wife, killed by you during the time of peace?\"\r\n\r\n\"Whosoever raises his hand against a Knight of the Cross, is a son of\r\ndarkness.\"\r\n\r\nHearing this, Sir de Lorche became thoughtful; but he did not have time\r\nto answer Danveld, because they arrived at a large, snow-covered glade in\r\nthe woods, on which the prince and his courtiers dismounted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nThe foresters under the direction of the head huntsman, placed the\r\nhunters in a long row at the edge of the forest, in such a way that being\r\nhidden themselves, they faced the glade. Nets were fastened along two\r\nsides of the glade, and behind these were the men whose duty it was to\r\nturn the beasts toward the hunters, or to kill them with spears if they\r\nbecame entangled in the nets. Many of the Kurpie were sent to drive every\r\nliving thing from the depths of the forest into the glade. Behind the\r\nhunters there was another net stretched; if an animal passed the row of\r\nhunters, he would be entangled in it and easily killed.\r\n\r\nThe prince was standing in the middle in a small ravine, which extended\r\nthrough the entire width of the glade. The head huntsman, Mrokota of\r\nMocarzew, had chosen that position for the prince because he knew that\r\nthe largest beasts would pass through this ravine. The prince had a\r\ncrossbow, and leaning on a tree beside him was a heavy spear; a little\r\nbehind him stood two gigantic \"defenders\" with axes on their shoulders,\r\nand holding crossbows ready to be handed to the prince. The princess and\r\nJurandowna did not dismount, because the prince would not allow them to\r\ndo so, on account of the peril from urus and bisons; it was easier to\r\nescape the fury of these fierce beasts on horseback than on foot. De\r\nLorche, although invited by the prince to take a position at his right\r\nhand, asked permission to remain with the ladies for their defence.\r\nZbyszko drove his spear into the snow, put his crossbow on his back and\r\nstood by Danusia's horse, whispering to her and sometimes kissing her. He\r\nbecame quiet only when Mrokota of Mocarzew, who in the forest scolded\r\neven the prince himself, ordered him to be silent.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, far in the depths of the wilderness, the horns of the\r\nKurpie were heard, and the noisy sound of a _krzywula_[100] answered from\r\nthe glade; then perfect silence followed. From time to time the chatter\r\nof the squirrels was heard in the tops of the pines. The hunters looked\r\nat the snow-covered glade, where only the wind moved the bushes, and\r\nasked themselves what kind of animals would first appear. They expected\r\nabundant game, because the wilderness was swarming with urus, bisons and\r\nboars. The Kurpie had smoked out a few bears which were wandering in the\r\nthickets, angry, hungry and watchful.\r\n\r\nBut the hunters were obliged to wait a long time, because the men who\r\nwere driving the animals toward the glade, had taken a very large space\r\nof the forest, and therefore they were so far away that the hunters did\r\nnot even hear the baying of the dogs, that had been freed from the\r\nleashes immediately after the horns resounded.\r\n\r\nAfter a while some wolves appeared on the edge of the forest, but having\r\nnoticed the people, they again plunged into the forest, evidently\r\nsearching for another pass. Then some boars having emerged from the\r\nwilderness, began to run in a long black line through the snowy space,\r\nlooking from afar like domestic swine. They stopped and listened--turned\r\nand listened again: turned toward the nets, but having smelt the men,\r\nwent in the direction of the hunters, snorting and approaching more and\r\nmore carefully; finally there resounded the clatter of the iron cranks of\r\nthe crossbows, the snarl of the bolts and then the first blood spotted\r\nthe white snow.\r\n\r\nThen a dreadful squealing resounded and the whole pack dispersed as if\r\nstruck by a thunderbolt; some of them rushed blindly straight ahead,\r\nothers ran toward the nets, while still others ran among the other\r\nanimals, with which the glade was soon covered. The sounds of the horns\r\nwere heard distinctly, mingled with the howling of the dogs and the\r\nbustle of the people coming from the depths of the forest. The wild\r\nbeasts of the forest driven by the huntsmen soon filled the glade. It was\r\nimpossible to see anything like it in foreign countries or even in the\r\nother Polish provinces; nowhere else was there such a wilderness as there\r\nwas in Mazowsze. The Knights of the Cross, although they had visited\r\nLithuania, where bisons attacked[101] and brought confusion to the army,\r\nwere very much astonished at the great number of beasts, and Sir de\r\nLorche was more astonished than they. He beheld in front of him herds of\r\nyellow deer and elks with heavy antlers, mingled together and running on\r\nthe glade, blinded by fear and searching in vain for a safe passage. The\r\nprincess, in whom Kiejstut's blood began to play, seeing this, shot arrow\r\nafter arrow, shouting with joy when a deer or an elk which was struck,\r\nreared and then fell heavily plowing the snow with his feet. Some of the\r\nladies-in-waiting were also shooting, because all were filled with\r\nenthusiasm for the sport. Zbyszko alone did not think about hunting; but\r\nhaving leaned his elbows on Danusia's knees and his head on the palms of\r\nhis hands, he looked into her eyes, and she smiling and blushing, tried\r\nto close his eyelids with her fingers, as if she could not stand such\r\nlooks.\r\n\r\nSir de Lorche's attention was attracted by an enormous bear, gray on the\r\nback and shoulders, which jumped out unexpectedly from the thicket near\r\nthe huntsmen. The prince shot at it with his crossbow, and then rushed\r\nforward with his boar-spear; when the animal roaring frightfully, reared,\r\nhe pierced it with his spear in the presence of the whole court so deftly\r\nand so quickly, that neither of the \"defenders\" needed to use his axe.\r\nThe young Lotaringer doubted that few of the other lords, at whose courts\r\nhe had visited during his travels, would dare to amuse themselves in such\r\na way, and believed that the Order would have hard work to conquer such\r\nprinces and such people. Later on he saw the other hunters pierce in the\r\nsame way, many boars much larger and fiercer than any that could be found\r\nin the forest of Lower Lotaringen or in the German wilderness. Such\r\nexpert hunters and those so sure of their strength, Sir de Lorche had\r\nnever before seen; he concluded, being a man of some experience, that\r\nthese people living in the boundless forests, had been accustomed from\r\nchildhood to use the crossbow and the spear; consequently they were very\r\ndexterous in using them.\r\n\r\nThe glade of the wood was finally covered with the dead bodies of many\r\ndifferent kinds of animals; but the hunt was not finished. In fact, the\r\nmost interesting and also the most perilous moment was coming, because\r\nthe huntsmen had met a herd of urus and bisons. The bearded bulls\r\nmarching in advance of the herd, holding their heads near the ground,\r\noften stopped, as if calculating where to attack. From their enormous\r\nlungs came a muffled bellowing, similar to the rolling of thunder, and\r\nperspiration steamed from their nostrils; while pawing the snow with\r\ntheir forefeet, they seemed to watch the enemy with their bloody eyes\r\nhidden beneath their manes. Then the huntsmen shouted, and their cries\r\nwere followed by similar shoutings from all sides; the horns and fifes\r\nresounded; the wilderness reverberated from its remotest parts; meantime\r\nthe dogs of the Kurpie rushed to the glade with tremendous noise. The\r\nappearance of the dogs enraged the females of the herd who were\r\naccompanied by their young. The herd which had been walking up to this\r\nmoment, now scattered in a mad rush all over the glade. One of the\r\nbisons, an enormous old yellow bull, rushed toward the huntsmen standing\r\nat one side, then seeing horses in the bushes, stopped, and bellowing,\r\nbegan to plow the earth with his horns, as if inciting himself to fight.\r\n\r\nSeeing this, the men began to shout still more, but among the hunters\r\nthere were heard frightened voices exclaiming: \"The princess! The\r\nprincess! Save the princess!\" Zbyszko seized his spear which had been\r\ndriven into the ground behind him and rushed to the edge of the forest;\r\nhe was followed by a few Litwins who were ready to die in defence of\r\nKiejstut's daughter; but all at once the crossbow creaked in the hands of\r\nthe lady, the bolt whistled and, having passed over the animal's head,\r\nstruck him in his neck.\r\n\r\n\"He is hit!\" exclaimed the princess; \"he will not escape.\"\r\n\r\nBut suddenly, with such a dreadful bellowing that the frightened horses\r\nreared, the bison rushed directly toward the lady; at the same moment\r\nwith no less impetus, Sir de Lorche rushed from beneath the trees and\r\nleaning on his horse, with his spear extended as in a knightly\r\ntournament, attacked the animal.\r\n\r\nThose near by perceived during one moment, the spear plunged into the\r\nanimal's neck, immediately bend like a bow, and break into small pieces;\r\nthen the enormous horned head disappeared entirely under the belly of Sir\r\nde Lorche's horse, and the charger and his rider were tossed into the\r\nair.\r\n\r\nFrom the forest the huntsmen rushed to help the foreign knight. Zbyszko\r\nwho cared most about the princess and Danusia's safety, arrived first and\r\ndrove his spear under the bison's shoulder blade. He gave the blow with\r\nsuch force, that the spear by a sudden turn of the bison, broke in his\r\nhands, and he himself fell with his face on the ground. \"He is dead! He\r\nis dead!\" cried the Mazurs who were rushing to help him. The bull's head\r\ncovered Zbyszko and pressed him to the ground. The two powerful\r\n\"defenders\" of the prince arrived; but they were too late; fortunately\r\nthe Czech Hlawa, given to Zbyszko by Jagienka, outstripped them, and\r\nhaving seized his broad-axe with both hands he cut the bison's bent neck,\r\nnear the horns.\r\n\r\nThe blow was so powerful that the animal fell, as though struck by a\r\nthunderbolt, with his head almost severed from his neck; this enormous\r\nbody fell on top of Zbyszko. Both \"defenders\" pulled it away quickly. The\r\nprincess and Danusia having dismounted, arrived at the side of the\r\nwounded youth.\r\n\r\nZbyszko, pale and covered with his own and the animal's blood, tried to\r\nrise; but he staggered, fell on his knees and leaning on his hands, could\r\nonly pronounce one word:\r\n\r\n\"Danuska.\"\r\n\r\nThen the blood gushed from his mouth. Danusia grasped him by his\r\nshoulders, but being unable to hold him, began to cry for help. The\r\nhuntsmen rubbed him with snow and poured wine in his mouth; finally the\r\nhead huntsman, Mrokota of Mocarzew ordered them to put him on a mantle\r\nand to stop the blood with soft spunk from the trees.\r\n\r\n\"He will live if his ribs and his backbone are not broken,\" said he,\r\nturning toward the princess. In the meanwhile some ladies of the court\r\nwith the help of other huntsmen, were attending to Sir de Lorche. They\r\nturned him over, searching in his armor for holes or dents made by the\r\nhorns of the bull; but besides traces of the snow, which had entered\r\nbetween the joints of the iron plates, they could find nothing. The urus\r\nhad avenged himself especially on the horse, which was lying dead beside\r\nthe knight; as for Sir de Lorche, he was not seriously injured. He had\r\nfainted and his right hand was sprained. When they took off his helmet\r\nand poured some wine in his mouth, he opened his eyes, and seeing the\r\nsorrowful faces of two pretty young ladies bent over him, said in German:\r\n\r\n\"I am sure I am in paradise already and the angels are over me.\"\r\n\r\nThe ladies did not understand what he said; but being glad to see him\r\nopen his eyes and speak, they smiled, and with the huntsmen's help raised\r\nhim from the ground; feeling the pain in his right hand, he moaned and\r\nleaned with the left on the shoulder of one of the \"angels\"; for a while\r\nhe stood motionless, fearing to make a step, because he felt weak. Then\r\nhe glanced around and perceived the yellow body of the urus, he also saw\r\nDanusia wringing her hands and Zbyszko lying on a mantle.\r\n\r\n\"Is that the knight who rushed to help me?\" he asked. \"Is he alive?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is very severely injured,\" answered a courtier who could speak\r\nGerman.\r\n\r\n\"From this time, I am going to fight not with him, but for him!\" said the\r\nLotaringer.\r\n\r\nAt this time, the prince who was near Zbyszko, approached Sir de Lorche\r\nand began to praise him because he had defended the princess and the\r\nother ladies, and perhaps saved their lives by his bold deed; for which,\r\nbesides the knightly reward, he would be renowned not only then but in\r\nall future generations.\r\n\r\n\"In these effeminate times,\" said he, \"there are few true knights\r\ntraveling through the world; therefore pray be my guest as long as\r\npossible or if you can, remain forever in Mazowsze, where you have\r\nalready won my favor, and by honest deeds will easily win the love of the\r\npeople.\"\r\n\r\nSir de Lorche's heart was filled with joy when he heard the prince's\r\nwords and realized that he had accomplished such a famous knightly deed\r\nand deserved such praise in these remote Polish lands, about which so\r\nmany strange things were told in the East. He knew that a knight who\r\ncould tell at the Burgundian court or at the court of Brabant, that when\r\non a hunting party, he had saved the life of the Mazowiecka princess,\r\nwould be forever famous.\r\n\r\nZbyszko became conscious and smiled at Danusia; then he fainted again.\r\nThe huntsmen seeing how his hands closed and his mouth remained open,\r\nsaid to one another that he would not live; but the more experienced\r\nKurpie, among whom many an one had on him the traces of a bear's paws, a\r\nboar's tusks or an urus' horns, affirmed that the urus' horn had slipped\r\nbetween the knight's ribs, that perhaps one or two of his ribs were\r\nbroken, but that the backbone was not, because if it were, he could not\r\nrise. They pointed out also, that Zbyszko had fallen in a snow-drift and\r\nthat had saved him, because on account of the softness the animal when\r\npressing him with his horns, could not entirely crush his chest, nor his\r\nbackbone.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the prince's physician, the _ksiondz_ Wyszoniek of\r\nDziewanna, was not with the hunting party, being busy in the chateau\r\nmaking wafers.[102] The Czech rushed to bring him immediately, and\r\nmeanwhile the Kurpie carried Zbyszko to the prince's mansion. The Knight\r\nof the Cross, Hugo von Danveld, helped Danusia mount her horse and then,\r\nriding beside her and closely following the men who were carrying\r\nZbyszko, said in Polish in a muffled voice, so that she alone could hear\r\nhim:\r\n\r\n\"In Szczytno I have a marvelous balm, which I received from a hermit\r\nliving in the Hercynski forest; I can bring it for you in three days.\"\r\n\r\n\"God will reward you,\" answered Danusia.\r\n\r\n\"God records every charitable deed; but will you reward me also?\"\r\n\r\n\"What reward can I give you?\"\r\n\r\nThe Krzyzak approached and evidently wished to say something else but\r\nhesitated; after a while he said:\r\n\r\n\"In the Order, besides the brothers there are also sisters. One of them\r\nwill bring the healing balm, and then I will speak about the reward.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nThe _ksiondz_ Wyszoniek dressed Zbyszko's wounds and he stated that only\r\none rib was broken; but the first day he could not affirm that the sick\r\nman would live, because he could not ascertain whether the heart had been\r\ninjured or not. Sir de Lorche was so ill toward morning that he was\r\nobliged to go to bed, and on the following day he could not move his hand\r\nnor his foot, without great pain in all the bones. The princess Danusia\r\nand some other ladies of the court nursed the sick men and prepared for\r\nthem, according to the prescriptions of the _ksiondz_ Wyszoniek,\r\ndifferent ointments and potions. But Zbyszko was very severely injured,\r\nand from time to time blood gushed from his mouth, and this alarmed the\r\n_ksiondz_ Wyszoniek very much. He was conscious however, and on the\r\nsecond day, although very weak, having learned from Danusia to whom he\r\nowed his life, called Hlawa to thank and reward him. He remembered that\r\nhe had received the Czech from Jagienka and that had it not been for her\r\nkind heart, he would have perished. He feared that he never would be able\r\nto repay the good-hearted girl for her kindness, but that he would only\r\nbe the cause of her sorrow.\r\n\r\n\"I swore to my _panienka_,\" said Hlawa, \"on my honor of a _wlodyka_, that\r\nI would protect you; therefore I will do it without any reward. You are\r\nindebted to her for your life.\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko did not answer, but began to breathe heavily; the Czech was\r\nsilent for a while, then he said:\r\n\r\n\"If you wish me to hasten to Bogdaniec, I will go. Perhaps you will be\r\nglad to see the old lord, because God only knows whether you will\r\nrecover.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does the _ksiondz_ Wyszoniek say?\" asked Zbyszko.\r\n\r\n\"The _ksiondz_ Wyszoniek says that he will know when the new moon comes.\r\nThere are four days before the new moon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hej! then you need not go to Bogdaniec, because I will either die, or I\r\nwill be well before my uncle could come.\"\r\n\r\n\"Could you not send a letter to Bogdaniec? Sanderus will write one. Then\r\nthey will know about you, and will engage a mass for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me rest now, because I am very ill. If I die, you will return to\r\nZgorzelice and tell how everything happened; then they can engage a mass.\r\nI suppose they will bury me here or in Ciechanow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think they will bury you in Ciechanow or in Przasnysz, because only\r\nthe Kurpie are buried in the forest, and the wolves howl over their\r\ngraves. I heard that the prince intends to return with the court to\r\nCiechanow in two days' time, and then to Warszawa.\"\r\n\r\n\"They would not leave me here alone,\" answered Zbyszko.\r\n\r\nHe guessed correctly, because that same day the princess asked the\r\nprince's permission to remain in the house in the wilderness, with\r\nDanusia and the ladies-in-waiting, and also with the _ksiondz_ Wyszoniek,\r\nwho was opposed to carrying Zbyszko to Przasnysz. Sir de Lorche at the\r\nend of two days felt better, and he was able to leave his bed; but having\r\nlearned that the ladies intended to remain, he stayed also, in order to\r\naccompany them on their journey and defend them in case the \"Saracens\"\r\nattacked them. Whence the \"Saracens\" could come, the Lotaringer did not\r\nknow. It is true that the people in the East used thus to call the\r\nLitwins; but from them no danger could threaten Kiejstut's daughter,\r\nWitold's sister and the first cousin of the mighty \"Krakowski king,\"\r\nJagiello. But Sir de Lorche had been among the Knights of the Cross for\r\nso long a time, that notwithstanding all he had heard in Mazowsze about\r\nthe baptism of the Litwa, and about the union of the two crowns on the\r\nhead of one ruler, he could not believe that any one could expect any\r\ngood from the Litwins. Thus the Knights of the Cross had made him\r\nbelieve, and he had not yet entirely lost all faith in their words.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime an incident occurred which cast a shadow between Prince\r\nJanusz and his guests. One day, before the departure of the court,\r\nBrother Godfried and Brother Rotgier, who had remained in Ciechanow, came\r\naccompanied by Sir de Fourcy, who was a messenger of bad news to the\r\nKnights of the Cross. There were some foreign guests at the court of the\r\nKrzyzacki _starosta_ in Lubowa; they were Sir de Fourcy and also Herr von\r\nBergow and Herr Meineger, both belonging to families which had rendered\r\ngreat services to the Order. They having heard many stories about Jurand\r\nof Spychow, determined, to draw the famous warrior into an open field,\r\nand ascertain for themselves whether he really was as dreadful as\r\nrepresented. The _starosta_ opposed the plan, giving as a reason that\r\nthere was peace between the Order and the Mazowiecki princes; but\r\nfinally, perhaps hoping thus to get rid of his terrible neighbor, not\r\nonly connived at the expedition but even furnished the armed _knechts_.\r\nThe knights sent a challenge to Jurand, who immediately accepted it under\r\nthe condition that they would send away the soldiers and that three of\r\nthem would fight with him and two of his companions on the boundaries of\r\nSzlonsk and Spychow. But when they refused to send away the _knechts_ or\r\nto retire from the land belonging to Spychow, he suddenly fell upon them,\r\nexterminated the _knechts_, pierced Herr Meineger dreadfully with a\r\nspear, took Herr von Bergow into captivity and put him into the\r\nSpychowski dungeon. De Fourcy alone escaped and after three days'\r\nwandering in the Mazowiecki forests, having learned from some\r\npitch-burners that there were some brothers of the Order in Ciechanow, he\r\nsucceeded in reaching them. He and the brothers of the Order made a\r\ncomplaint to the prince, and asked for the punishment of Jurand, and for\r\nan order for the deliverance of Herr von Bergow.\r\n\r\nThis news disturbed the good understanding between the prince and his\r\nguests, because not only the two newly arrived brothers but also Hugo von\r\nDanveld and Zygfried von Löve, began to beseech the prince to render\r\njustice to the Order, to free the boundaries from the plunderer and to\r\npunish him once for all his offences. Hugo von Danveld, having his own\r\ngrievance against Jurand, the remembrance of which burned him with shame\r\nand grief, asked for vengeance almost threateningly.\r\n\r\n\"The complaint will go to the grand master,\" he said; \"and if we be not\r\nable to get justice from Your Grace, he will obtain it himself, even if\r\nthe whole Mazowsze help that robber.\"\r\n\r\nBut the prince, although naturally good-tempered, became angry and said.\r\n\r\n\"What kind of justice do you ask for? If Jurand had attacked you first,\r\nthen I would surely punish him. But your people were the first to\r\ncommence hostilities. Your _starosta_ gave the _knechts_, permission to\r\ngo on that expedition. Jurand only accepted the challenge and asked that\r\nthe soldiers be sent away. Shall I punish him for that? You attacked that\r\ndreadful man, of whom everybody is afraid, and voluntarily brought\r\ncalamity upon yourselves--what do you want then? Shall I order him not to\r\ndefend himself, when it pleases you to attack him?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was not the Order that attacked him, but its guests, foreign\r\nknights,\" answered Hugo.\r\n\r\n\"The Order is responsible for its guests, and then the _knechts_, from\r\nthe Lubowski garrison were there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Could the _starosta_ allow his guests to be slaughtered?\"\r\n\r\nHere the prince turned to Zygfried and said.\r\n\r\n\"You must take heed lest your wiles offend God.\"\r\n\r\nBut the stern Zygfried answered:\r\n\r\n\"Heir von Bergow must be released from captivity, because the men of his\r\nfamily were high dignitaries in the Order and they rendered important\r\nservices to the Cross.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Meineger's death must be avenged,\" added Hugo von Danveld.\r\n\r\nThereupon the prince arose and walked threateningly toward the Germans;\r\nbut after a while, evidently having remembered that they were his guests,\r\nhe restrained his anger, put his hand on Zygfried's shoulder, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Listen: you wear a cross on your mantle, therefore answer according to\r\nyour conscience--upon that cross! Was Jurand right or was he not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Herr von Bergow must be released from prison,\" answered Zygfried von\r\nLöve.\r\n\r\nThere was as a moment of silence; then the prince said:\r\n\r\n\"God grant me patience!\"\r\n\r\nZygfried continued sharply, his words cutting like a sword:\r\n\r\n\"The wrong which was done to us in the persons of our guests, is only one\r\nmore occasion for complaint. From the time the Order was founded, neither\r\nin Palestine, nor in Siedmiogrod,[103] nor among the heathenish Litwa,\r\nhas any man wronged us so much as that robber from Spychow. Your\r\nHighness! we ask for justice and vengeance not for one wrong, but for\r\nthousands; not for the blood shed once, but for years of such deeds, for\r\nwhich fire from heaven ought to burn that nest of wickedness and cruelty.\r\nWhose moanings entreat God for vengeance? Ours! Whose tears? Ours! We\r\nhave complained in vain. Justice has never been given us!\"\r\n\r\nHaving heard this, Prince Janusz began to nod his head and said:\r\n\r\n\"Hej! formerly the Krzyzaks were received hospitably in Spychow, and\r\nJurand was not your foe, until after his dear wife died on your rope; and\r\nhow many times have you attacked him first, wishing to kill him, as in\r\nthis last case, because he challenged and defeated your knights? How many\r\ntimes have you sent assassins after him, or shot at him with a crossbow\r\nfrom the forest? He attacked you, it is true, because vengeance burns\r\nwithin him; but have you not attacked peaceful people in Mazowsze? Have\r\nyou not taken their herds, burned their houses and murdered the men,\r\nwomen and children? And when I complained to the grand master, he sent me\r\nthis reply from Marienburg: 'Customary frolic of the boundaries' Let me\r\nbe in peace! Was it not you who captured me when I was without arms,\r\nduring the time of peace, on my own land? Had it not been for your fear\r\nof the mighty Krakowski king, probably I would have had to moan until now\r\nin captivity. Who ought to complain? With such gratitude you repaid me,\r\nwho belonged to the family of your benefactors. Let me be in peace; it is\r\nnot you who have the right to talk about justice!\"\r\n\r\nHaving heard this, the Knights of the Cross looked at each other\r\nimpatiently, angry because the prince mentioned the occurrence at\r\nZlotorja, in the presence of Sir de Fourcy; therefore Hugo von Danveld,\r\nwishing to finish the conversation about it, said:\r\n\r\n\"That was a mistake, Your Highness, and we made amends for it, not on\r\naccount of fear of the Krakowski king, but for the sake of justice; and\r\nwith regard to the frolics on the boundaries, the grand master cannot be\r\nheld responsible, because on every frontier there are some restless\r\nspirits.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you say this yourself, and still you ask for the punishment of\r\nJurand. What do you wish then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Justice and punishment!\"\r\n\r\nThe prince clenched his bony fists and repeated:\r\n\r\n\"God grant me patience!\"\r\n\r\n\"Your Princely Majesty must also remember,\" said Danveld, further, \"that\r\nour wantons only wrong lay people who do not belong to the German race,\r\nbut your men raise their hand against the German Order, and for this\r\nreason they offend our Saviour Himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen!\" said the prince. \"Do not talk about God; you cannot deceive\r\nHim!\"\r\n\r\nThen having placed his hands on the Krzyzak's shoulders, he shook him so\r\nstrongly, that he frightened him. He relented immediately and said,\r\nmildly:\r\n\r\n\"If it be true that our guests attacked Jurand first and did not send\r\naway the soldiers, I will not blame him; but had Jurand really accepted\r\nthe challenge?\"\r\n\r\nHaving said this, he looked at Sir de Fourcy, winking at him, to deny it;\r\nbut the latter, not wishing to lie, answered:\r\n\r\n\"He asked us to send our soldiers away, and to fight three against\r\nthree.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure of that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Upon my honor! Herr von Bergow and I agreed, but Meineger did not\r\nconsent.\"\r\n\r\nHere the prince interrupted:\r\n\r\n\"_Starosta_ from Szczytno! you know better than anybody else that Jurand\r\nwould not miss a challenge.\"\r\n\r\nThen he turned to all present and said:\r\n\r\n\"If one of you will challenge Jurand to a fight on horseback or on foot,\r\nI give my permission. If he be taken prisoner or killed, then Herr von\r\nBergow will be released without paying any ransom. Do not ask me for\r\nanything else, because I will not grant it.\"\r\n\r\nAfter these words, there was a profound silence. Hugo von Danveld,\r\nZygfried von Löve, Brother Rotgier and Brother Godfried, although brave,\r\nknew the dreadful lord of Spychow too well to dare to challenge him for\r\nlife or death. Only a foreigner from a far distant country, like de\r\nLorche or de Fourcy, would do it; but de Lorche was not present during\r\nthe conversation, and Sir de Fourcy was still too frightened.\r\n\r\n\"I have seen him once,\" he muttered, \"and I do not wish to see him any\r\nmore.\"\r\n\r\nZygfried von Löve said:\r\n\r\n\"It is forbidden the monks to fight in single combat, except by special\r\npermission from the grand master and the grand marshal; but I do not ask\r\nfor permission for a combat, but for the release of von Bergow and the\r\npunishment by death of Jurand.\"\r\n\r\n\"You do not make the laws in this country.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our grand master will know how to administer justice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your grand master has nothing to do with Mazowsze!\"\r\n\r\n\"The emperor and the whole German nation will help him.\"\r\n\r\n\"The king of Poland will help me, and he is more powerful than the German\r\nemperor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does Your Highness wish for a war with the Order?\"\r\n\r\n\"If I wanted a war, I would not wait for you to come to Mazowsze, but\r\nwould go toward you; you need not threaten me, because I am not afraid of\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"What shall I say to the grand master?\"\r\n\r\n\"He has not asked you anything. Tell him what you please.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we will avenge ourselves.\"\r\n\r\nThereupon the prince stretched forth his arm and began to shake his\r\nfinger close to the Krzyzak's face.\r\n\r\n\"Keep quiet!\" said he, angrily; \"keep quiet! I gave you permission to\r\nchallenge Jurand; but if you dare to invade this country with the army of\r\nthe Order, then I will attack you, and you will stay here not as a guest\r\nbut as a prisoner.\"\r\n\r\nEvidently his patience was entirely exhausted, because he threw a cap\r\nviolently on the table and left the room, slamming the door. The Knights\r\nof the Cross became pale and Sir de Fourcy looked at them askance.\r\n\r\n\"What will happen now?\" asked Brother Rotgier, who was the first to break\r\nthe silence.\r\n\r\nHugo von Danveld turned to Sir de Fourcy and menacing him with his fists,\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Why did you tell him that you attacked Jurand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because it is true!\"\r\n\r\n\"You should have lied.\"\r\n\r\n\"I came here to fight and not to lie.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you fought well, indeed!\"\r\n\r\n\"And you! did you not run away from Jurand of Spychow?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Pax!_\" said von Löve. \"This knight is a guest of the Order.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is immaterial what he said,\" added Brother Godfried. \"They would not\r\npunish Jurand without a trial, and in the court, the truth would come\r\nout.\"\r\n\r\n\"What will be done now?\" repeated Brother Rotgier.\r\n\r\nThere was a moment of silence; then the sturdy and virulent Zygfried von\r\nLöve spoke:\r\n\r\n\"We must finish once for all with that bloody dog!\" said he. \"Herr von\r\nBergow must be released from his fetters. We will gather the garrisons\r\nfrom Szczytno, Insburk and Lubowa; we will summon the Chelminsk nobility\r\nand attack Jurand. It is time to settle with him!\"\r\n\r\n\"We cannot do it without permission from the grand master.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we succeed, the grand master will be pleased!\" said Brother Godfried.\r\n\r\n\"But if we do not succeed? If the prince go against us?\"\r\n\r\n\"He will not do that if there is peace between him and the Order.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is peace, but we are going to violate it. Our garrisons will not\r\nbe sufficient to fight against the Mazurs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then the grand master will help us and there will be a war.\"\r\n\r\nDanveld frowned again and became thoughtful.\r\n\r\n\"No! no!\" said he after a while. \"If we be successful, the grand master\r\nwill be pleased. Envoys will be sent to the prince, there will be\r\nnegotiations and we will go scot-free. But in case of defeat, the Order\r\nwill not intercede for us and will not declare war. Another grand master\r\nis necessary for that. The Polski king is behind the prince, and the\r\ngrand master will not quarrel with him.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we have taken the Dobrzynska province; it is evident that we are not\r\nafraid of Krakow.\"\r\n\r\n\"There was some pretext--Opolczyk. We took it apparently in pledge, and\r\nthen----\" Here he looked around and said quietly:\r\n\r\n\"I heard in Marienburg, that if they threaten us with war, we will return\r\nthe province.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said Brother Rotgier, \"if we had Markward Salzbach with us, or\r\nShomberg who killed Witold's whelps, he would find some remedy against\r\nJurand. Witold was the king's viceroy and a grand duke! Notwithstanding\r\nthat, Shomberg was not punished. He killed Witold's children, and went\r\nscot-free! Verily, there is great lack among us of people who can find a\r\nremedy for everything.\"\r\n\r\nHaving heard this, Hugo von Danveld put his elbows on the table, leaned\r\nhis head on his hands and plunged into deep thought. Then his eyes became\r\nbright, he wiped, according to his custom, his moist, thick lips with the\r\nupper part of his hand and said:\r\n\r\n\"May the moment in which you mentioned, pious brother, the name of the\r\nvaliant Shomberg be blessed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why? Have you found a remedy?\" asked Zygfried von Löve.\r\n\r\n\"Speak quickly!\" exclaimed Brother Godfried.\r\n\r\n\"Listen,\" said Hugo. \"Jurand has a daughter here, his only child, whom he\r\nloves dearly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, so he has. We know her. The princess Anna Danuta loves her also.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Listen then: if you capture this girl, Jurand will give as a ransom\r\nfor her, not only, Bergow, but all his prisoners, himself and Spychow!\"\r\n\r\n\"By Saint Bonifacius' blood shed in Duchum!\" exclaimed Brother Godfried;\r\n\"it would be as you say!\"\r\n\r\nThen they were silent, as if frightened by the boldness and the\r\ndifficulties of the enterprise. But after a while Brother Rotgier turned\r\ntoward Zygfried von Löve, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Your judgment and experience are equal to your bravery: what do you\r\nthink about this plan?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think that the matter is worthy of consideration.\"\r\n\r\n\"Because,\" said Rotgier further, \"the girl is a lady-in-waiting with the\r\nprincess--the princess loves her as if she were her own daughter. Think,\r\npious brother, what an uproar will arise.\"\r\n\r\nBut Hugo von Danveld began to laugh:\r\n\r\n\"You said yourself, that Shomberg poisoned or strangled Witold's whelps,\r\nand what happened to him? They will raise an uproar about anything we do;\r\nbut if we sent Jurand in chains to the grand master, then it is certain\r\nthat we could expect reward rather than punishment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said von Löve, \"there is a good opportunity for an attack. The\r\nprince is going away and Anna Danuta will remain here alone with her\r\ncourt. However it is a serious matter to invade the prince's house during\r\nthe time of peace. The prince's house is not Spychow. It will be the same\r\nthing that happened in Zlotorja! Again complaints against the Order will\r\ngo to all kings and to the pope; again that cursed Jagiello will threaten\r\nus, and the grand master; you know him: he is glad to take hold of\r\nanything he can, but he does not wish for war with Jagiello. Yes! there\r\nwill be a great uproar in all the provinces of Mazowsze and of Polska.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the meanwhile Jurand's bones will whiten on a hook,\" answered Brother\r\nHugo. \"Then we do not need to take his daughter from the prince's\r\nmansion.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we cannot do it from Ciechanow either, because there, besides the\r\nnoblemen, there are three hundred archers.\"\r\n\r\n\"No. But Jurand can become ill and send for his daughter. Then the\r\nprincess would not prevent her going, and if the girl be lost on the\r\nroad, who will accuse you or me and say to us: 'You captured her!'\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah!\" answered von Löve, impatiently. \"You must first make Jurand sick\r\nand then make him summon the girl.\"\r\n\r\nAt this Hugo smiled triumphantly and answered:\r\n\r\n\"I have a goldsmith, who having been driven from Marienburg for theft,\r\nsettled in Szczytno and who is able to make a seal; I also have people,\r\nwho although our bondmen, came from the Mazurski country. Do you\r\nunderstand me yet?\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand,\" shouted Brother Godfried.\r\n\r\nAnd Rotgier raised his hands and said:\r\n\r\n\"May God bless you, pious brother, because neither Markward Salzbach, nor\r\nShomberg could find better means.\"\r\n\r\nThen he half closed his eyes, as if he saw something afar.\r\n\r\n\"I see Jurand,\" said he, \"with a rope around his neck, standing at the\r\nGdansk gate in Marienburg and our _knechts_ are kicking him.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the girl will become a servant of the Order,\" said Hugo.\r\n\r\nHaving heard this, von Löve turned his severe eyes on Danveld; but the\r\nlatter again rubbed his lips with the upper part of his hand and said:\r\n\r\n\"And now to Szczytno as soon as we can!\"\r\n\r\nBefore starting on the journey to Szczytno, the four brothers of the\r\nOrder and de Fourcy went to bid the prince and the princess adieu. It was\r\nnot a very friendly farewell; but the prince, not wishing to act contrary\r\nto the old Polish custom which did not permit the guests to depart with\r\nempty hands, made each brother a present of some beautiful marten-fur and\r\nof one _grzywna_ of silver; they received the presents with great\r\npleasure, assuring the prince that being brothers of an order, and having\r\nmade a solemn promise to live in poverty, they would not retain the money\r\nfor themselves, but would distribute it among the poor, whom they would\r\nrecommend to pray for the prince's health, fame and future salvation.\r\n\r\nThe Mazurs laughed in their sleeves at such an assurance, because they\r\nknew very well how rapacious the Order was, and still better what liars\r\nthe Knights of the Cross were.\r\n\r\nIt was a popular saying in Mazowsze: \"As the skunk smells, so the Krzyzak\r\nlies.\" The prince waved his hand to such thanks, and after they went out\r\nhe said that by the intervention of the Knights of the Cross, one would\r\ngo to heaven as swiftly as the craw-fish walks.\r\n\r\nBut before that, while taking leave of the princess, at the moment that\r\nZygfried von Löve kissed her hand, Hugo von Danveld approached Danusia,\r\nput his hand on her head and caressing her, said:\r\n\r\n\"Our commandment is to return good for evil, and even to love our enemy;\r\ntherefore I will send a sister of the Order here, and she will bring you\r\nthe healing balm.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can I thank you for it?\" answered Danusia.\r\n\r\n\"Be a friend of the Order and of the monks.\"\r\n\r\nDe Fourcy noticed this conversation, and in the meantime he was struck by\r\nthe beauty of the young girl; therefore as they traveled toward Szczytno,\r\nhe asked:\r\n\r\n\"Who is that beautiful lady of the court with whom you were talking while\r\ntaking leave of the princess?\"\r\n\r\n\"Jurand's daughter!\" answered the Krzyzak.\r\n\r\nSir de Fourcy was surprised.\r\n\r\n\"The same whom you propose to capture?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. And when we capture her, Jurand is ours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Evidently everything is not bad that comes from Jurand. It will be worth\r\nwhile to guard such a prisoner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think it will be easier to fight with her than with Jurand?\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean that I think the same as you do. The father is a foe of the\r\nOrder; but you spoke words as sweet as honey to the daughter, and besides\r\nyou promised to send her the balm.\"\r\n\r\nEvidently Hugo von Danveld felt the need of justification before Zygfried\r\nvon Löve who, although not better than the others, observed the austere\r\nlaws of the Order, and very often scolded the other brothers.\r\n\r\n\"I promised her the balm,\" said Hugo, \"for that young knight, who was\r\ninjured by the bison and to whom she is betrothed. If they make an outcry\r\nwhen the girl is captured, then we will tell them that we did not wish to\r\nharm her any, and the best proof of it will be that on account of\r\nChristian mercy we sent her some medicine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said von Löve. \"Only we must send somebody whom we can\r\ntrust.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will send a pious woman, entirely faithful to the Order. I will\r\ncommand her to look and to listen. When our people, apparently sent by\r\nJurand, arrive, they will find the road already prepared.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be difficult to get such people.\"\r\n\r\n\"No! In our province the people speak the same language. There are in our\r\ncity, bah! even among the _knechts_ of the garrison, some men who left\r\nMazowsze because they were pursued by the law; it is true they are\r\nthieves and robbers; but they do not fear anybody and they are ready to\r\ndo anything. To those men, I will promise, in case they succeed, a large\r\nreward; if they fail, a rope.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah! Suppose they betray us?\"\r\n\r\n\"They will not betray us, because in Mazowsze every one of them deserves\r\nto be hanged. Only we must give them decent clothes so that they will be\r\ntaken for Jurand's servants; and we must get the principal thing: a\r\nletter with Jurand's seal.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must foresee everything,\" said Brother Rotgier. \"It is probable that\r\nJurand will go to see the prince, and justify himself on account of the\r\nlast war. If he is in Ciechanow, he will go to see his daughter. It may\r\nhappen that our men when they go to capture Jurandowna, will come in\r\ncontact with Jurand himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"The men whom I am going to choose are sharp. They will know that they\r\nwill be hanged if they come in contact with Jurand. It will be to their\r\nown interest not to meet him.\"\r\n\r\n\"But they may be captured.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we will deny them and the letter. Who can prove that we sent them?\r\nAnd then if there be no outrage, there will be no outcry, and it will not\r\nharm the Order, if Mazury cut several scoundrels into pieces.\"\r\n\r\nBrother Godfried, the youngest of the monks, said:\r\n\r\n\"I do not understand your policy, nor your fear that it may be known that\r\nthe girl was carried off by our command. Because if we have her in our\r\npossession, we will be obliged to send some one to Jurand to tell him:\r\n'Your daughter is with us; if you wish her to be set at liberty, give von\r\nBergow and yourself in exchange for her.' You cannot do otherwise, and\r\nthen it will be known that we ordered the girl to be carried off.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true!\" said Sir de Fourcy, who did not like the whole affair.\r\n\"Why should we hide that which must come out?\"\r\n\r\nBut Hugo von Danveld began to laugh, and turning to Brother Godfried,\r\nasked:\r\n\r\n\"How long have you worn the white mantle?\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be six years the first week after the day of the Holy Trinity.\"\r\n\r\n\"When you have worn it six years longer, you will understand the affairs\r\nof the Order better. Jurand knows us better than you do. We will tell\r\nhim: 'Your daughter is watched by Brother Shomberg; if you say a word,\r\nremember what happened to Witold's children!'\"\r\n\r\n\"And then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then von Bergow will be free and the Order also will be free from\r\nJurand.\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" exclaimed Brother Rotgier; \"everything is planned so cleverly that\r\nGod ought to bless our enterprise.\"\r\n\r\n\"God blesses all deeds whose purpose is the good of the Order,\" said the\r\ngloomy Zygfried von Löve.\r\n\r\nThen they rode silently, and before them went their retinue, to open the\r\nway, because the road was covered with a heavy snow, which had fallen\r\nduring the night. The day was cloudy, but warm; therefore the horses were\r\nsteaming. From the forest flocks of crows were flying toward the\r\nvillages, filling the air with their gloomy cawing.\r\n\r\nSir de Fourcy remained a little bit behind the Knights of the Cross and\r\nrode along in deep thought. He had been the guest of the Order for\r\nseveral years, and had participated in the expeditions against the Zmudz,\r\nwhere he distinguished himself by great bravery. Everywhere he had been\r\nreceived as the Knights of the Cross knew how to receive the knights from\r\nremote countries; he became attached to them very strongly, and not being\r\nrich, he planned to join their ranks. In the meanwhile he either lived in\r\nMarienburg, or visited the commanderies, searching in his travels for\r\ndistractions and adventures. Having just arrived at Lubowa with the rich\r\nvon Bergow, and having heard about Jnrand, he desired very much to fight\r\nwith the man who was regarded with general dread. The arrival of\r\nMeineger, who was always victorious, precipitated the expedition. The\r\n_comthur_ of Lubowa furnished the men for it, but in the meanwhile he\r\ntold them so much not only about Jurand's cruelty, but also about his\r\ncunning and treachery, that when Juvand asked them to send away the\r\nsoldiers, they refused to do it, fearing that if they did, he would\r\nsurround and exterminate them or else capture and put them into the\r\nSpychowski dungeons. Then Jurand thinking that they cared less about a\r\nknightly fight than about plunder, attacked them and defeated them. De\r\nFourcy saw von Bergow overthrown with his horse; he saw Meineger with a\r\npiece of a spear in his body, and he saw the men asking in vain for\r\nmercy. He escaped with great difficulty, and wandered for several days in\r\nthe forests, where he would have died of hunger or been destroyed by wild\r\nbeasts, if by chance he had not reached Ciechanow, where he found\r\nBrothers Godfried and Rotgier. From the expedition he emerged with a\r\nfeeling of humiliation and shame, and with a desire for vengeance and a\r\nlonging after Bergow, who was his dear friend. Therefore he joined with\r\nhis whole soul in the complaint of the Knights of the Cross, when they\r\nasked for the punishment of the Polish knight and the freedom of his\r\nunhappy companion. When their complaint had no effect whatever, in the\r\nfirst moment he was ready to approve of any plan for vengeance against\r\nJurand. But now some scruples were aroused in him. Listening to the\r\nconversation of the monks, and especially to what Hugo von Danveld said,\r\nhe could not refrain from astonishment. It is true, that having become\r\nwell acquainted during the past few years with the Knights of the Cross,\r\nhe knew that they were not what they were represented to be in Germany\r\nand in the West. In Marienburg, he knew, however, a few honest and\r\nupright knights who often complained of the corruption of the brothers,\r\nof their lasciviousness and lack of discipline; de Fourcy felt that they\r\nwere right, but being himself dissolute and lacking in discipline, he did\r\nnot criticise them for those faults, especially because all knights of\r\nthe Order redeemed them with bravery. He had seen them at Wilno, fighting\r\nbreast to breast with the Polish knights; at the taking of castles,\r\ndefended with superhuman stubbornness by Polish garrisons; he had seen\r\nthem perishing under the blows of axes and swords, in general assaults or\r\nin single combats. They were merciless and cruel toward the Litwa, but at\r\nthe same time, they were as brave as lions.\r\n\r\nBut now it seemed to Sir de Fourcy, that Hugo von Danveld advised such\r\nactions from which every knight's soul should recoil; and the other\r\nbrothers not only were not angry with him, but approved of his words.\r\nTherefore astonishment seized him more and more; finally he became deeply\r\nthoughtful, pondering whether it was proper to join in the performance of\r\nsuch deeds.\r\n\r\nIf it were only a question of carrying off the girl and then exchanging\r\nher for Bergow, he would perhaps consent to that, although his heart had\r\nbeen moved by Danusia's beauty. But evidently the Knights of the Cross\r\nwished for something else. Through her they wished to capture Jurand, and\r\nthen murder him, and together with him,--in order to hide the fraud and\r\nthe crime--must assuredly murder the girl also.\r\n\r\nThey had threatened her already with the same fate that Witold's children\r\nmet, in case Jurand should dare to complain. \"They do not intend to keep\r\nany promise, but to cheat both and kill both,\" said de Fourcy, to\r\nhimself, \"although they wear the cross, and ought to guard their honor\r\nmore than anybody else.\"\r\n\r\nHe became more and more indignant at such effrontery, and he determined\r\nto verify his suspicions; therefore he rode near Danveld and asked:\r\n\r\n\"If Jurand give himself up to you, will you set the girl at liberty?\"\r\n\r\n\"If we let her go free, the whole world would immediately say that we had\r\ncaptured both of them,\" answered Danveld.\r\n\r\n\"Then, what do you propose to do with her?\"\r\n\r\nAt this Danveld bent toward the knight, and laughing, showed his rotten\r\nteeth from beneath his thick lips.\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean what will be done with her, before or after?\"\r\n\r\nBut Fourcy, surmising already that which he wished to know, became\r\nsilent; for a while he seemed to struggle with himself; then he raised\r\nhimself in his stirrups and said so loudly that he could be heard by all\r\nfour of the monks:\r\n\r\n\"The pious brother, Ulrych von Jungingen, who is an example and an\r\nornament of knighthood, said to me: 'Among the old knights in Marienburg,\r\none can still find worthy Knights of the Cross; but those who control the\r\ncommanderies near the frontier, only bring shame upon the Order.'\"\r\n\r\n\"We are all sinful, but we serve the Saviour,\" answered Hugo.\r\n\r\n\"Where is your knightly honor? One cannot serve the Saviour by shameful\r\ndeeds. You must know that I will not put my hand to anything like that,\r\nand that I also will prevent you.\"\r\n\r\n\"What will you prevent?\"\r\n\r\n\"The artifice, the treachery, the shame!\"\r\n\r\n\"How can you do it? In the fight with Jurand, you lost your retinue and\r\nwagons. You are obliged to live on the generosity of the Order, and you\r\nwill die from hunger if we do not throw you a piece of bread; and then,\r\nyou are alone, we are four--how could you prevent us?\"\r\n\r\n\"How can I prevent you?\" repeated de Fourcy. \"I can return to the mansion\r\nand warn the prince; I can divulge your plans to the whole world.\"\r\n\r\nHere the brothers of the Order looked at one another, and their faces\r\nchanged in the twinkling of an eye. Hugo von Danveld, especially, looked\r\nquestioningly into Zygfried von Löve's eyes; then he turned to Sir de\r\nFourcy:\r\n\r\n\"Your ancestors,\" said he, \"used to serve in the Order, and you wished to\r\njoin it also; but we do not receive traitors.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I do not wish to serve with traitors.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ej! you shall not fulfill your threat. The Order knows how to punish not\r\nonly the monks----\"\r\n\r\nSir de Fourcy being excited by these words, drew his sword, and seized\r\nthe blade with his left hand; his right hand he put on the hilt and said:\r\n\r\n\"On this hilt which is in the form of the cross, on St. Denis, my\r\npatron's head, and on my knightly honor, I swear that I will warn the\r\nMazowiecki prince and the grand master.\"\r\n\r\nHugo von Danveld again looked inquiringly at Zygfried von Löve, who\r\nclosed his eyelids, as if consenting to something.\r\n\r\nThen Danveld said in a strangely muffled and changed voice:\r\n\r\n\"St. Denis could carry his head after he was beheaded, but when yours\r\nonce falls down----\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you threatening me?\" interrupted de Fourcy.\r\n\r\n\"No, but I kill!\" answered Danveld. And he thrust his knife into de\r\nFourcy's side with such strength, that the blade disappeared up to the\r\nhilt. De Fourcy screamed dreadfully; for a while he tried to seize his\r\nsword which he held in his left hand, with his right, but he dropped it;\r\nat the same time, the other three brothers began to pierce him\r\nmercilessly with their knives, in the neck, in the back, and in the\r\nstomach, until he fell from his horse.\r\n\r\nThen there was silence. De Fourcy bleeding dreadfully from several\r\nwounds, quivered on the snow. From beneath the leaden sky, there came\r\nonly the cawing of the crows, which were flying from the silent\r\nwilderness, toward human habitations.\r\n\r\nThen there began a hurried conversation between the murderers:\r\n\r\n\"Our servants did not see anything!\" said Danveld, panting.\r\n\r\n\"No. The retinues are in front; we cannot see them,\" answered von Löve.\r\n\r\n\"Listen: we will have cause for a new complaint. We will publish the\r\nstatement that the Mazowiecki knights fell upon us and killed our\r\ncompanion. We will shout aloud--they will hear us in Marienburg--that the\r\nprince sent murderers even after his guests. Listen! we must say that\r\nJanusz did not wish to listen to our complaints against Jurand, but that\r\nhe ordered the accuser to be murdered.\"\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, de Fourcy turned in the last convulsion on his back and\r\nthen remained motionless, with a bloody froth on his lips and with dread\r\npictured in his widely-opened dead eyes. Brother Rotgier looked at him\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n\"Notice, pious brothers, how God punishes even the thought of treachery.\"\r\n\r\n\"What we have done, was done for the good of the Order,\" answered\r\nGodfried. \"Glory to those----\"\r\n\r\nBut he stopped, because at that moment, behind them, at the turn of the\r\nsnowy road, there appeared a horseman, who rushed forward as fast as his\r\nhorse could go. Having perceived him, Hugo von Danveld quickly exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Whoever this man is--he must die.\" And von Löve, who although the oldest\r\namong the brothers, had very keen eyesight, said:\r\n\r\n\"I recognize him; it is that shield-bearer who killed the bison with an\r\naxe. Yes; it is he!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hide your knives, so that he may not become frightened,\" said Danveld.\r\n\"I will attack him first, you shall follow me.\"\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, the Bohemian arrived and reined in his horse at a\r\ndistance of eight or ten steps. He noticed the corpse lying in the pool\r\nof blood, the horse without a rider, and astonishment appeared on his\r\nface; but it lasted only for the twinkling of an eye. After a while, he\r\nturned to the brothers as if nothing had happened and said:\r\n\r\n\"I bow to you, brave knights!\"\r\n\r\n\"We recognize you,\" answered Danveld, approaching slowly. \"Have you\r\nanything for us?\"\r\n\r\n\"The knight Zbyszko of Bogdaniec, after whom I carry the spear, sent me,\r\nbecause being injured by the bison, he could not come himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does your master wish from us?\"\r\n\r\n\"My master commanded me to tell you that because you unrighteously\r\naccused Jurand of Spychow, to the detriment of his knightly honor, you\r\ndid not act like honest knights, but howled like dogs; and if any one of\r\nyou feels insulted by these words, he challenges him to a combat on\r\nhorseback or on foot, to the last breath; he will be ready for the duel\r\nas soon as with God's help and mercy he is released from his present\r\nindisposition.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell your master, that the Knights of the Order bear insults patiently\r\nfor the Saviour's sake, and they cannot fight, without special permission\r\nfrom the grand master or from the grand marshal; for which permission\r\nthey will write to Malborg.\"\r\n\r\nThe Czech again looked at de Fourcy's corpse, because he had been sent\r\nespecially to that knight. Zbyszko knew that the monks could not fight in\r\nsingle combat: but having heard that there was a secular knight with\r\nthem, he wanted to challenge him especially, thinking that by doing so he\r\nwould win Jurand's favor. But that knight was lying slaughtered like an\r\nox, by the four Knights of the Cross.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the Czech did not understand what had happened; but being\r\naccustomed from childhood to different kinds of danger, he suspected some\r\ntreachery. He was also surprised to see Danveld, while talking with him,\r\napproach him closer and closer; the others began to ride to his sides, as\r\nif to surround him. Consequently he was upon the alert, especially as he\r\ndid not have any weapons; he had not brought any, being in great haste.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile Danveld who was near him, said:\r\n\r\n\"I promised your master some healing balm; he repays me badly for my good\r\ndeed. But no wonder, that is the usual thing among the Polaks. But as he\r\nis severely injured and may soon be called to God, tell him then----\"\r\n\r\nHere he leaned his left hand on the Czech's shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Tell him then, that I--well--I answer this way!----\"\r\n\r\nAnd at the same moment, his knife gleamed near the throat of the\r\nshield-bearer; but before he could thrust, the Czech who had been\r\nwatching his movements closely, seized Danveld's right hand, with his\r\niron-like hands, bent and twisted it so that the bones cracked; then\r\nhearing a dreadful roaring of pain, he pricked his horse and rushed away\r\nlike an arrow, before the others could stop him.\r\n\r\nBrothers Rotgier and Godfried pursued him, but they soon returned,\r\nfrightened by a dreadful cry from Danveld. Von Löve supported him with\r\nhis shoulders, while he cried so loudly that the retinue, riding with the\r\nwagons in front at quite a distance, stopped their horses.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter with you?\" asked the brothers.\r\n\r\nBut von Löve ordered them to ride forward as fast as they could, and\r\nbring a wagon, because Danveld could not remain in his saddle. After a\r\nmoment, a cold perspiration covered his forehead and he fainted.\r\n\r\nWhen they brought the wagon, they put him on some straw in the bottom and\r\nhurried toward the frontier. Von Löve urged them forward because he\r\nrealized that after what had happened, they could not lose time in\r\nnursing Danveld. Having seated himself beside him in the wagon, he rubbed\r\nhis face with snow from time to time; but he could not resuscitate him.\r\nAt last when near the frontier, Danveld opened his eyes and began to look\r\naround.\r\n\r\n\"How do you feel?\" asked Löve.\r\n\r\n\"I do not feel any pain, but neither can I feel my hand,\" answered\r\nDanveld.\r\n\r\n\"Because it has grown stiff already; that is why you do not feel any\r\npain. It will come back in a warm room. In the meanwhile, thank God even\r\nfor a moment of relief.\"\r\n\r\nRotgier and Godfried approached the wagon.\r\n\r\n\"What a misfortune!\" said the first. \"What shall we do now?\"\r\n\r\n\"We will declare,\" said Danveld in a feeble voice, \"that the\r\nshield-bearer murdered de Fourcy.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is their latest crime and the culprit is known!\" added Rotgier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, the Czech rushed as fast as he could to the prince's\r\nhunting residence, and finding the prince still there, he told him first,\r\nwhat had happened. Happily there were some courtiers who had seen the\r\nshield-bearer go without any arms. One of them had even shouted after\r\nhim, half in jest, to take some old iron, because otherwise the Germans\r\nwould get the best of him; but he, fearing that the knights would pass\r\nthe frontier, jumped on horseback as he stood, in a sheepskin overcoat\r\nonly and hurried after them. These testimonies dispelled all possible\r\ndoubts from the prince's mind as to the fact who had murdered de Fourcy;\r\nbut they filled him with uneasiness and with such anger, that at first he\r\nwanted to pursue the Knights of the Cross, capture them and send them to\r\nthe grand master in chains. After a while, however, he came to the\r\nconclusion, that it was impossible to reach them on this side of the\r\nboundary and he said:\r\n\r\n\"I will send, instead, a letter to the grand master, so that he may know\r\nwhat they are doing here. God will punish them for it!\"\r\n\r\nThen he became thoughtful and after a while he began to say to the\r\ncourtiers:\r\n\r\n\"I cannot understand why they killed their guest; I would suspect the\r\nshield-bearer if I did not know that he went there without weapons.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah!\" said the _ksiondz_ Wyszoniek, \"why should the boy kill him? He had\r\nnot seen him before. Then suppose he had had arms, how could he attack\r\nfive of them and their armed retinues?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true,\" said the prince. \"That guest must have opposed them in\r\nsomething, or perhaps he did not wish to lie as was necessary for them. I\r\nsaw them wink at him, to induce him to say that Jurand was the first to\r\nbegin the fight.\"\r\n\r\nThen Mrokota of Mocarzew said:\r\n\r\n\"He is a strong boy, if he could crush the arm of that dog Danveld.\"\r\n\r\n\"He said that he heard the bones of the German crack,\" answered the\r\nprince; \"and taking into consideration what he did in the forest, one\r\nmust admit it is true! The master and the servant are both strong boys.\r\nBut for Zbyszko, the bison would have rushed against the horses. Both the\r\nLotaringer and he contributed very much to the rescue of the princess.\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure they are great boys,\" affirmed the _ksiondz_ Wyszoniek. \"Even\r\nnow when he can hardly breathe, he has taken Jurand's part and challenged\r\nthose knights. Jurand needs exactly such a son-in-law.\"\r\n\r\n\"In Krakow, Jurand said differently; but now, I think he will not oppose\r\nit,\" said the prince.\r\n\r\n\"The Lord Jesus will help,\" said the princess, who entered just now and\r\nheard the end of the conversation.\r\n\r\n\"Jurand cannot oppose it now, if only God will restore Zbyszko's health;\r\nbut we must reward him also.\"\r\n\r\n\"The best reward for him will be Danusia, and I think he will get her,\r\nfor when the women resolve to accomplish some object, then even Jurand\r\nhimself could not prevent them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Am I not right, to wish for that marriage?\" asked the princess.\r\n\r\n\"I would not say a word if Zbyszko were not constant; but I think there\r\nis no other in the world as faithful as he. And the girl also. She does\r\nnot leave him now for a moment; she caresses him and he smiles at her,\r\nalthough he is very ill. I cry myself when I see this! I am speaking\r\nrighteously! It is worth while to help such a love, because the Holy\r\nMother looks gladly on human happiness.\"\r\n\r\n\"If it be God's will,\" said the prince, \"the happiness will come. But it\r\nis true that he nearly lost his head for that girl and now the bison has\r\ninjured him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not say it was for that girl,\" said the princess, quickly, \"because\r\nin Krakow Danusia saved him.\"\r\n\r\n\"True! But for her sake he attacked Lichtenstein, in order to tear from\r\nhis head the feathers, and he would not have risked his life for de\r\nLorche. As for the reward, I said before that they both deserve one, and\r\nI will think about it in Ciechanow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing will please Zbyszko more than to receive the knightly girdle and\r\nthe golden spurs.\"\r\n\r\nThe prince smiled benevolently and answered:\r\n\r\n\"Let the girl carry them to him; and when the illness leaves him, then we\r\nwill see that everything is accomplished according to the custom. Let her\r\ncarry them to him immediately, because quick joy is the best!\"\r\n\r\nThe princess having heard that, hugged her lord in the presence of the\r\ncourtiers, and kissed his hands; he smiled continually and said:\r\n\r\n\"You see--A good idea! I see that the Holy Ghost has granted the woman\r\nsome sense also! Now call the girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"Danuska! Danuska!\" called the princess.\r\n\r\nAnd in a moment in the side door Danusia appeared; her eyes were red on\r\naccount of sleepless nights; and she held a pot of steaming gruel, which\r\nthe _ksiondz_ Wyszoniek had ordered to be put on Zbyszko's fractured\r\nbones.\r\n\r\n\"Come to me, my dear girl!\" said Prince Janusz. \"Put aside the pot and\r\ncome.\"\r\n\r\nWhen she approached with some timidity, because \"the lord\" always excited\r\nsome fear in her, he embraced her kindly and began to caress her face,\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\n\"Well, the poor child is unhappy--_hein_?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes!\" answered Danusia.\r\n\r\nAnd having sadness in her heart, she began to cry but very quietly, in\r\norder not to hurt the prince; he asked again:\r\n\r\n\"Why do you cry?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because Zbyszko is ill,\" answered she, putting her little hands to her\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\"Do not be afraid, there is no danger for him. Is that not true, Father\r\nWyszoniek?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hej! by God's will, he is nearer to the wedding than to the coffin,\"\r\nanswered the good-hearted _ksiondz_ Wyszoniek.\r\n\r\nThe prince said:\r\n\r\n\"Wait! In the meanwhile, I will give you a medicine for him, and I trust\r\nit will relieve him or cure him entirely.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have the Krzyzaks sent the balm?\" asked Danusia quickly, taking her\r\nlittle hands from her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"With that balm which the Krzyzaks will send, you had better smear a dog\r\nthan a knight whom you love. I will give you something else.\"\r\n\r\nThen he turned to the courtiers and said:\r\n\r\n\"Hurry and bring the spurs and the girdle.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a while, when they had brought them to him, he said to Danusia:\r\n\r\n\"Take these to Zbyszko--and tell him that from this time he is a belted\r\nknight. If he die, then he will appear before God as _miles cinctus_; if\r\nhe live, then the rest will be accomplished in Ciechanow or in Warszawa.\"\r\n\r\nHaving heard this, Danusia seized \"the lord\" by his knees; then caught\r\nthe knightly insignia with one hand and the pot of porridge with the\r\nother, and rushed to the room where Zbyszko was lying. The princess, not\r\nwishing to lose the sight of their joy, followed her.\r\n\r\nZbyszko was very ill, but having perceived Danusia, he turned his pale\r\nface toward her and asked:\r\n\r\n\"Has the Czech returned?\"\r\n\r\n\"No matter about the Czech!\" answered the girl. \"I bring you better news\r\nthan that. The lord has made you a knight and has sent you this by me.\"\r\n\r\nHaving said this, she put beside him the girdle and the spurs. Zbyszko's\r\npale cheeks flushed with joy and astonishment, he glanced at Danusia and\r\nthen at the spurs; then he closed his eyes and began to repeat:\r\n\r\n\"How could he dub me a knight?\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment the princess entered, and he raised himself a little and\r\nbegan to thank her, because he guessed that her intervention had brought\r\nsuch a great favor and bliss to him. But she ordered him to be quiet and\r\nhelped Danusia to put his head on the pillows again. In the meanwhile,\r\nthe prince, the _ksiondz_ Wyszoniek, Mrokota and several other courtiers\r\nentered.\r\n\r\nPrince Janusz waved his hand to signify that Zbyszko must not move; then\r\nhaving seated himself beside the bed, he said:\r\n\r\n\"You know! The people must not wonder that there is reward for good\r\ndeeds, because if virtue remained without any reward, human iniquities\r\nwould walk without punishment. You did not spare your life, but with\r\nperil to yourself defended us from dreadful mourning; therefore we permit\r\nyou to don the knightly girdle, and from this moment to walk in glory and\r\nfame.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gracious lord,\" answered Zbyszko. \"I would not spare even ten lives----\"\r\n\r\nBut he could not say anything more, on account of his emotion; and the\r\nprincess put her hand on his mouth because the _ksiondz_ Wyszoniek did\r\nnot permit him to talk. The prince continued further:\r\n\r\n\"I think that you know the knightly duties and that you will wear the\r\ninsignia with honor. You must serve our Saviour, and fight with the\r\n_starosta_ of hell. You must be faithful to the anointed lord, avoid\r\nunrighteous war and defend innocence against oppression; may God and His\r\nHoly Passion help you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Amen!\" answered the _ksiondz_ Wyszoniek.\r\n\r\nThe prince arose, made the sign of the cross over Zbyszko and added:\r\n\r\n\"And when you recover, go immediately to Ciechanow, where I will summon\r\nJurand.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nThree days afterward, a woman arrived with the Hercynski balm and with\r\nher came the captain of the archers from Szczytno, with a letter, signed\r\nby the brothers and sealed with Danveld's seal; in that letter the\r\nKnights of the Cross called on heaven and earth as witnesses of the\r\nwrongs committed against them in Mazowsze, and with a threat of God's\r\nvengeance, they asked for punishment for the murder of their \"beloved\r\ncomrade and guest.\" Danveld added to the letter his personal complaint,\r\nasking humbly but also threateningly for remuneration for his crippled\r\nhand and a sentence of death against the Czech. The prince tore the\r\nletter into pieces in the presence of the captain, threw it under his\r\nfeet and said:\r\n\r\n\"The grand master sent those scoundrels of Krzyzaks to win me over, but\r\nthey have incited me to wrath. Tell them from me that they killed their\r\nguest themselves and they wanted to murder the Czech. I will write to the\r\ngrand master about that and I will request him to send different envoys,\r\nif he wishes me to be neutral in case of a war between the Order and the\r\nKrakowski king.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gracious lord,\" answered the captain, \"must I carry such an answer to\r\nthe mighty and pious brothers?\"\r\n\r\n\"If it is not enough, tell them then, that I consider them dog-brothers\r\nand not honest knights.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the end of the audience. The captain went away, because the\r\nprince departed the same day for Ciechanow. Only the \"sister\" remained\r\nwith the balm, but the mistrustful _ksiondz_ Wyszoniek did not wish to\r\nuse it, especially as the sick man had slept well the preceding night and\r\nhad awakened without any fever, although still very weak. After the\r\nprince's departure, the sister immediately sent a servant for a new\r\nmedicine apparently--for the \"egg of a basilisk\"--which she affirmed had\r\nthe power to restore strength even to people in agony; as for herself,\r\nshe wandered about the mansion; she was humble and was dressed in a lay\r\ndress, but similar to that worn by members of the Order; she carried a\r\nrosary and a small pilgrim's gourd at her belt. She could not move one of\r\nher hands. As she could speak Polish well, she inquired from the servants\r\nabout Zbyszko and Danusia, to whom she made a present of a rose of\r\nJericho; on the second day during Zbyszko's slumber, while Danusia was\r\nsitting in the dining-room, she approached her and said:\r\n\r\n\"May God-bless you, _panienko_. Last night after my prayers I dreamed\r\nthat there were two knights walking during the fall of the snow; one of\r\nthem came first and wrapped you in a white mantle, and the other said: 'I\r\nsee only the snow, and she is not here,' and he returned.\"\r\n\r\nDanusia who was sleepy, immediately opened her blue eyes curiously, and\r\nasked:\r\n\r\n\"What does it mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"It means that the one who loves you the best, will get you.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is Zbyszko!\" said the girl.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know, because I did not see his face; I only saw the white\r\nmantle and then I awakened; the Lord Jesus sends me pain every night in\r\nmy feet and I cannot move my hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is strange that the balm has not helped you any!\"\r\n\r\n\"It cannot help me, _panienko_, because the pain is a punishment for a\r\nsin; if you wish to know what the sin was, I will tell you.\"\r\n\r\nDanusia nodded her little head in sign that she wished to know; therefore\r\nthe \"sister\" continued:\r\n\r\n\"There are also servants, women, in the Order, who, although they do not\r\nmake any vows, and are allowed to marry, are obliged to perform certain\r\nduties for the Order, according to the brothers' commands. The one who\r\nmeets such favor and honor, receives a pious kiss from a brother-knight\r\nas a sign that from that moment she is to serve the Order with words and\r\ndeeds. Ah! _panienko_!--I was going to receive that great favor, but in\r\nsinful obduracy instead of receiving it with gratitude, I committed a\r\ngreat sin and was punished for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did you do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Brother Danveld came to me and gave me the kiss of the Order; but I,\r\nthinking that he was doing it from pure license, raised my wicked hand\r\nagainst him----\"\r\n\r\nHere she began to strike her breast and repeated several times:\r\n\r\n\"God, be merciful to me, a sinner!\"\r\n\r\n\"What happened then?\" asked Danusia.\r\n\r\n\"Immediately my hand became motionless, and from that moment I have been\r\ncrippled. I was young and stupid--I did not know! But I was punished. If\r\na woman fears that a brother of the Order wishes to do something wicked,\r\nshe must leave the judgment to God, but she must not resist herself,\r\nbecause whosoever contradicts the Order or a brother of the Order, that\r\none will feel God's anger!\"\r\n\r\nDanusia listened to these words with fright and uneasiness; the sister\r\nbegan to sigh and to complain.\r\n\r\n\"I am not old yet,\" said she; \"I am only thirty years old, but besides\r\nthe hand, God has taken from me my youth and beauty.\"\r\n\r\n\"If it were not for the hand,\" said Danusia, \"you need not complain.\"\r\n\r\nThen there was silence. Suddenly the sister, as if she had just\r\nremembered something, said:\r\n\r\n\"I dreamed that some knight wrapped you with a white mantle on the snow.\r\nPerhaps it was a Krzyzak! They wear white mantles.\"\r\n\r\n\"I want neither Krzyzaks nor their mantles,\" answered the girl.\r\n\r\nBut further conversation was interrupted by the _ksiondz_ Wyszoniek, who\r\nentering the room, nodded to Danusia and said:\r\n\r\n\"Praise God and come to Zbyszko! He has awakened and has asked for\r\nsomething to eat. He is much better.\"\r\n\r\nIn fact it was so. Zbyszko was a great deal better, and the _ksiondz_\r\nWyszoniek was almost sure that he would recover, when an unexpected\r\naccident upset all his expectations. There came envoys from Jurand with a\r\nletter to the princess, containing dreadful news. In Spychow, half of\r\nJurand's _grodek_ had been burned, and he himself during the rescue was\r\nstruck by a beam. It is true that the _ksiondz_ Kaleb, who wrote the\r\nletter, said that Jurand, would recover, but that the sparks had burned\r\nhis remaining eye so badly that there was very little sight left in it,\r\nand he was likely to become blind.\r\n\r\nFor that reason, Jurand asked his daughter to come to Spychow as soon as\r\npossible, because he wished to see her once more, before he was entirely\r\nencompassed by darkness. He also said that she was to remain with him,\r\nbecause even the blind, begging on the roads, had some one to lead them\r\nby the hand and show them the way; why should he be deprived of that\r\npleasure and die among strangers? There were also humble thanks for the\r\nprincess, who had taken care of the girl like a mother, and finally\r\nJurand promised that, although blind, he would go to Warszawa once more,\r\nin order to fall at the lady's feet and beg her for further favor for\r\nDanusia.\r\n\r\nThe princess, when the _ksiondz_ Wyszoniek had finished reading the\r\nletter, could not say a word for some time. She had hoped that when\r\nJurand came to see his daughter and her, she would be able by the\r\nprince's and her own influence to obtain his consent for the wedding of\r\nthe young couple. But this letter, not only destroyed her plans, but in\r\nthe meanwhile deprived her of Danusia whom she loved as well as she did\r\nher own children. She feared that Jurand would marry the girl to some\r\nneighbor of his, so as to spend the rest of his life among his own\r\npeople. It was no use to think about Zbyszko--he could not go to Spychow,\r\nand then who knew how he would be received there. The lady knew that\r\nJurand had refused to give him Danusia; and he had said to the princess\r\nherself that on account of some secret reason, he would never consent to\r\ntheir marriage. Therefore in great grief she ordered the principal\r\nmessenger to be brought to her, as she desired to ask him about the\r\nSpychowski misfortune, and also to learn something about Jurand's plans.\r\n\r\nShe was very much surprised when a stranger came instead of the old\r\nTolima, who used to bear the shield after Jurand and usually carried his\r\nmessages; but the stranger told her that Tolima had been seriously\r\ninjured in the last fight with the Germans and that he was dying in\r\nSpychow; Jurand being very ill himself, asked her to send his daughter\r\nimmediately, because every day he saw less and less, and perhaps in a few\r\ndays he would become blind. The messenger begged the princess to permit\r\nhim to take the girl immediately after the horses were rested, but as it\r\nwas already dusk she refused; especially as she did not wish to distress\r\nZbyszko and Danusia by such a sudden separation.\r\n\r\nZbyszko already knew all about it, and he was lying like one stricken by\r\na heavy blow; when the princess entered, and wringing her hands, said\r\nfrom the threshold:\r\n\r\n\"We cannot help it; he is her father!\" he repeated after her like an\r\necho: \"We cannot help it----\" then closed his eyes, like a man who\r\nexpects death immediately.\r\n\r\nBut death did not come; but in his breast there gathered a still greater\r\ngrief and through his head ran sad thoughts, like the clouds which driven\r\nby the wind, obstruct the sun and quench all joy in the world. Zbyszko\r\nunderstood as well as the princess did, that if Danusia were once in\r\nSpychow, she would be lost to him forever. Here everybody was his friend;\r\nthere Jurand might even refuse to receive him, or listen to him,\r\nespecially if he were bound by a vow, or some other unknown reason as\r\nstrong as a religious vow. Then how could he go to Spychow, when he was\r\nsick and hardly able to move in bed. A few days ago, when the prince\r\nrewarded him with the golden spurs, he had thought that his joy would\r\nconquer his illness, and he had prayed fervently to God to be permitted\r\nto soon rise and fight with the Krzyzaks; but now he had again lost all\r\nhope, because he felt that if Danusia were not at his bedside, then with\r\nher would go his desire for life and the strength to fight with death.\r\nWhat a pleasure and joy it had been to ask her several times a day: \"Do\r\nyou love me?\" and to see how she covered her smiling and bashful eyes, or\r\nbent and answered: \"Yes, Zbyszko.\"\r\n\r\nBut now only illness, loneliness and grief would remain, and the\r\nhappiness would depart and not return.\r\n\r\nTears shone in Zbyszko's eyes and rolled slowly down on his cheeks; then\r\nhe turned to the princess and said:\r\n\r\n\"Gracious lady, I fear that I shall never see Danusia again.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the lady being sorrowful herself, answered:\r\n\r\n\"I would not be surprised if you died from grief; but the Lord Jesus is\r\nmerciful.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a while, however, wishing to comfort him, she added:\r\n\r\n\"But if Jurand die first, then the tutelage will be the prince's and\r\nmine, and we will give you the girl immediately.\"\r\n\r\n\"He will not die!\" answered Zbyszko.\r\n\r\nBut at once, evidently some new thought came to his mind, because he\r\narose, sat on the bed and said in a changed voice:\r\n\r\n\"Gracious lady----\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment Danusia interrupted him; she came crying and said from the\r\nthreshold:\r\n\r\n\"Zbyszku! Do you know about it already! I pity _tatus_, but I pity you\r\nalso, poor boy!\"\r\n\r\nWhen she approached, Zbyszko encircled his love with his well arm, and\r\nbegan to speak:\r\n\r\n\"How can I live without you, my dearest? I did not travel through rivers\r\nand forest, I did not make the vow to serve you, that I might lose you.\r\nHej! sorrow will not help, crying will not help, bah! even death itself,\r\nbecause even if the grass grow over me, my soul will not forget you, even\r\nif I am in the presence of the Lord Jesus or of God the Father--I say,\r\nthere must be a remedy! I feel a terrible pain in my bones, but you must\r\nfall at the lady's feet, I cannot--and ask her to have mercy upon us.\"\r\n\r\nDanusia hearing this, ran quickly to the princess' feet, and having\r\nseized them in her arms, she hid her face in the folds of the heavy\r\ndress; the lady turned her compassionate but also astonished eyes to\r\nZbyszko, and said:\r\n\r\n\"How can I show you mercy? If I do not let the child go to her sick\r\nfather, I will draw God's anger on myself.\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko who had been sitting on the bed, slipped down on the pillows and\r\ndid not answer for a time because he was exhausted. Slowly, however, he\r\nbegan to move one hand toward the other on his breast until he joined\r\nthem as in prayer.\r\n\r\n\"Rest,\" said the princess; \"then you may tell me what you wish; and you,\r\nDanusia, arise and release my knees.\"\r\n\r\n\"Relax, but do not rise; beg with me,\" said Zbyszko.\r\n\r\nThen he began to speak in a feeble and broken voice:\r\n\r\n\"Gracious lady--Jurand was against me in Krakow--he will be here also,\r\nbut if the _ksiondz_ Wyszoniek married me to Danusia, then--afterward she\r\nmay go to Spychow because there is no human power that could take her\r\naway from me----\"\r\n\r\nThese words were so unexpected to the princess, that she jumped from the\r\nbench; then she sat down again and as if she had not thoroughly\r\nunderstood about what he was talking, she said:\r\n\r\n\"For heaven's sake! the _ksiondz_ Wyszoniek.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gracious lady! Gracious lady!\" begged Zbyszko.\r\n\r\n\"Gracious lady!\" repeated Danusia, embracing the princess' knees.\r\n\r\n\"How could it be done without her father's permission?\"\r\n\r\n\"God's law is the stronger!\" answered Zbyszko.\r\n\r\n\"For heaven's sake!\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is the father, if not the prince? Who is the mother, if not you,\r\ngracious lady?\"\r\n\r\nAnd Danusia added:\r\n\r\n\"Dearest _matuchna_!\"[104]\r\n\r\n\"It is true, that I have been and am still like a mother to her,\" said\r\nthe princess, \"and Jurand received his wife from my hand. It is true! And\r\nif you are once married--everything is ended. Perhaps Jurand will be\r\nangry, but he must be obedient to the commands of the prince, his lord.\r\nThen, no one need tell him immediately, only if he wanted to give the\r\ngirl to another, or to make her a nun; and if he has made some vow, it\r\nwill not be his fault that he cannot fulfill it. Nobody can act against\r\nGod's will--perhaps it is God's will!\"\r\n\r\n\"It cannot be otherwise!\" exclaimed Zbyszko.\r\n\r\nBut the princess, still very much excited, said:\r\n\r\n\"Wait, I must collect my thoughts. If the prince were here, I would go to\r\nhim immediately and would ask him: 'May I give Danusia to Zbyszko or\r\nnot?' But I am afraid without him, and there is not much time to spare,\r\nbecause the girl must go to-morrow! Oh, sweet Jesus, let her go\r\nmarried--then there will be peace. But I cannot recover my senses\r\nagain--and then I am afraid of something. And you Danusia, are you not\r\nafraid?--Speak!\"\r\n\r\n\"I will die without that!\" interrupted Zbyszko.\r\n\r\nDanusia arose from the princess' knees; she was not only really on\r\nconfidential terms with the good lady, but also much spoiled by her;\r\ntherefore she seized her around the neck, and began to hug her.\r\n\r\nBut the princess said:\r\n\r\n\"I will not promise you anything without Father Wyszoniek. Run for him\r\nimmediately!\"\r\n\r\nDanusia went after Father Wyszoniek; Zbyszko turned his pale face toward\r\nthe princess, and said:\r\n\r\n\"What the Lord Jesus has destined for me will happen; but for this\r\nconsolation, may God reward you, gracious lady.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not bless me yet,\" answered the princess, \"because we do not know\r\nwhat will happen. You must swear to me upon you honor, that if you are\r\nmarried, you will not prevent the girl from going to her father, or else\r\nyou will draw his curse upon her and yourself.\r\n\r\n\"Upon my honor!\" said Zbyszko.\r\n\r\n\"Remember then! And the girl must not tell Jurand immediately. We will\r\nsend for him from Ciechanow, and make him come with Danusia, and then I\r\nwill tell him myself, or I will ask the prince to do it. When he sees\r\nthat there is no remedy, he will consent. He did not dislike you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Zbyszko, \"he did not dislike me; perhaps he will be pleased\r\nwhen Danusia is mine. If he made a vow, it will not be his fault that he\r\ncould not keep it.\"\r\n\r\nThe conversation was interrupted by the entrance of Danusia and the\r\n_ksiondz_ Wyszoniek. The princess immediately asked his advice and began\r\nto tell him with great enthusiasm about Zbyszko's plan; but as soon as he\r\nheard about it, he made the sign of the cross from astonishment and said:\r\n\r\n\"In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost! How can\r\nI do it? It is advent!\"\r\n\r\n\"For God's sake! That is true!\" exclaimed the princess.\r\n\r\nThen there was silence; only their sorrowful faces showed what a blow\r\nthose words of the _ksiondz_ Wyszoniek were to all of them.\r\n\r\nThen he said after a while:\r\n\r\n\"If you had a dispensation, then I would not oppose it, because I pity\r\nyou. I would not ask for Jurand's permission, because our gracious lady\r\nconsents and, vouches for the prince's consent--well! they are the mother\r\nand the father for the whole of Mazowsze. But without a bishop's\r\ndispensation, I cannot. Bah! if the _ksiondz_ bishop of Kurdwanow were\r\nwith us, he would not refuse a dispensation, although he is a severe\r\npriest, not like his predecessor, Bishop Mamphiolus, who used always to\r\nanswer: _Bene! Bene!_\"\r\n\r\n\"Bishop Jacob of Kurdwanow loves the prince and myself very much,\" said\r\nthe lady.\r\n\r\n\"Therefore I say he would not refuse a dispensation, more so because\r\nthere are some reasons for one: the girl must go to her father and that\r\nyoung man is ill and may die--Hm! _in articulo mortis!_ But without a\r\ndispensation I cannot.\"\r\n\r\n\"I could obtain it afterward from Bishop Jacob; no matter how severe he\r\nmay be, he will not refuse me this favor. I guarantee, he will not\r\nrefuse,\" said the princess.\r\n\r\nTo this the _ksiondz_ Wjszoniek who was a good and easy man, replied:\r\n\r\n\"A word of the Lord's anointed is a great word. I am afraid of the\r\n_ksiondz_ bishop, but that great word! Then the youth could promise\r\nsomething to the cathedral in Plock. Well, as long as the dispensation\r\nwill not come, there will be a sin--and nobody's but mine. Hm! It is\r\ntrue that the Lord Jesus is merciful and if any one sin not for his own\r\nbenefit, but on account of mercy for human misery, he forgives more\r\neasily! But there will be a sin, and suppose the bishop should refuse,\r\nwho will grant me pardon?\"\r\n\r\n\"The bishop will not refuse!\" exclaimed Princess Anna.\r\n\r\nAnd Zbyszko said:\r\n\r\n\"That man Sanderus, who came with me, has pardons ready for everything.\"\r\n\r\nThe _ksiondz_ Wyszoniek probably did not believe entirely in Sanderus'\r\npardons; but he was glad to have even a pretext so that he could help\r\nDanusia and Zbyszko, because he loved the girl, whom he had known from\r\nchildhood. Then he remembered that at the worst, he would be punished\r\nwith church penitence, therefore turning toward the princess he said:\r\n\r\n\"It is true, I am a priest, but I am also the prince's servant. What do\r\nyou command, gracious lady?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not wish to command but to beg,\" answered the lady. \"If that\r\nSanderus has pardons----\"\r\n\r\n\"Sanderus has. But there is the question about the bishop. He is very\r\nsevere with the canons in Plock.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not be afraid of the bishop. I have heard that he has forbidden the\r\npriest to carry swords and crossbows and has forbidden different\r\nlicenses, but he has not forbidden them to do good.\"\r\n\r\nThe _ksiondz_ Wyszoniek raised his eyes and his hands, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Let it be according to your wish!\"\r\n\r\nAt this word, joy filled their hearts. Zbyszko again sat on the bed and\r\nthe princess, Danusia and Father Wyszoniek sat round it and began to plan\r\nhow they should act.\r\n\r\nThey decided to keep it secret so that not a soul in the house should\r\nknow anything about it; they also decided that Jurand must not know until\r\nthe princess herself told him in Ciechanow about everything.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, the _ksiondz_ Wyszoniek was to write a letter from the\r\nprincess to Jurand and ask him to come to Ciechanow, where he could find\r\nbetter medicine and where he will not weary. Finally, they decided, that\r\nZbyszko and Danusia will go to confession, that the wedding ceremony will\r\nbe performed during the night, when everybody will retire.\r\n\r\nThe thought came to Zbyszko to have his shield-bearer, the Czech, as a\r\nwitness of the wedding; but he gave up the idea when he remembered that\r\nhe had received him from Jagienka. For a moment she stood in his memory\r\nas though present, so that it seemed to him that he saw her blushing face\r\nand her eyes full of tears, and heard her pleading voice say: \"Do not do\r\nthat! Do not repay me with evil for good, nor with misery for love!\" Then\r\nat once great compassion for her seized him, because he felt that a great\r\nwrong would be done her, after which she would find no consolation under\r\nthe roof of Zgorzelice, nor in the depths of the forest, nor in the\r\nfields, nor in the abbot's gifts, nor in Cztan and Wilk's courtship.\r\nTherefore he said inwardly: \"Girl, may God give you the best of\r\neverything, for although I am willing to bend the sky for you, I cannot.\"\r\nIn fact, the thought that he could not help it, immediately brought him\r\nrelief, and tranquillity returned, so that immediately he began to think\r\nonly about Danusia and the wedding.\r\n\r\nBut he was obliged to call the Czech to help him; therefore although he\r\ndetermined not to say a word to him about what was going to happen, he\r\nsummoned him and said:\r\n\r\n\"To-day I am going to confession as well as to the Lord's table;\r\ntherefore you must dress me in my best clothing as if I were going to the\r\nking's palace.\"\r\n\r\nThe Czech was a little afraid and began to look into his face; Zbyszko\r\nhaving noticed this, said:\r\n\r\n\"Do not be alarmed, people do not go to confession only when they expect\r\nto die; the holy days are coming, Father Wyszoniek and the princess are\r\ngoing to Ciechanow, and then there will be no priest nearer than in\r\nPrzasnysz.\"\r\n\r\n\"And are you not going?\" asked the shield-bearer.\r\n\r\n\"If I recover my health, then I will go; but that is in God's hands.\"\r\n\r\nTherefore the Czech was quieted; he hurried to the chests, and brought\r\nthat white _jaka_ embroidered with gold, in which the knight used to\r\ndress for great occasions, and also a beautiful rug to cover the bed;\r\nthen having lifted Zbyszko, with the help of the two Turks, he washed\r\nhim, and combed his long hair on which he put a scarlet zone; finally he\r\nplaced him on red cushions, and satisfied with his own work, said:\r\n\r\n\"If Your Grace were able to dance, you could celebrate even a wedding!\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be necessary to celebrate it without dancing,\" answered Zbyszko,\r\nsmiling.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile the princess was also thinking how to dress Danusia,\r\nbecause for her womanly nature it was a question of great importance, and\r\nunder no consideration would she consent to have her beloved foster child\r\nmarried in her everyday dress. The servants who were also told that the\r\ngirl must dress in the color of innocence for confession, very easily\r\nfound a white dress, but there was great trouble about the wreath for the\r\nhead. While thinking of it, the lady became so sad that she began to\r\ncomplain:\r\n\r\n\"My poor orphan, where shall I find a wreath of rue for you in this\r\nwilderness? There is none here, neither a flower, nor a leaf; only some\r\ngreen moss under the snow.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Danusia, standing with loosened hair, also became sorrowful, because\r\nshe wanted a wreath; after awhile, however, she pointed to the garlands\r\nof immortelles, hanging on the walls of the room, and said:\r\n\r\n\"We must weave a wreath of those flowers, because we will not find\r\nanything else, and Zbyszko will take me even with such a wreath.\"\r\n\r\nThe princess would not consent at first, being afraid of a bad omen; but\r\nas in this mansion, to which they came only for hunting, there were no\r\nflowers, finally the immortelles were taken. In the meanwhile, Father\r\nWyszoniek came, and received Zbyszko's confession; afterwards he listened\r\nto the girl's confession and then the gloomy night fell. The servants\r\nretired after supper, according to the princess' order. Some of Jurand's\r\nmen lay down in the servants' room, and others slept in the stables with\r\nthe horses. Soon the fires in the servants' room became covered with\r\nashes and were quenched; finally everything became absolutely quiet in\r\nthe forest house, only from time to time the dogs were heard howling at\r\nthe wolves in the direction of the wilderness.\r\n\r\nBut in the princess', Father Wyszoniek's and Zbyszko's rooms, the windows\r\nwere shining, throwing red lights on the snow which covered the\r\ncourt-yard. They were waiting in silence, listening to the throbbing of\r\ntheir own hearts--uneasy and affected by the solemnity of the moment\r\nwhich was coming. In fact, after midnight, the princess took Danusia by\r\nthe hand and conducted her to Zbyszko's room, where Father Wyszoniek was\r\nwaiting for them. In the room there was a great blaze in the fireplace,\r\nand by its abundant but unsteady light, Zbyszko perceived Danusia; she\r\nlooked a little pale on account of sleepless nights; she was dressed in a\r\nlong, stiff, white dress, with a wreath of immortelles on her brow. On\r\naccount of emotion, she closed her eyes; her little hands were hanging\r\nagainst the dress, and thus she appeared like some painting on a church\r\nwindow; there was something spiritual about her; Zbyszko was surprised\r\nwhen he saw her, and thought that he was going to marry not an earthly,\r\nbut a heavenly being. He still thought this when she kneeled with crossed\r\nhands to receive the communion, and having bent her head, closed her eyes\r\nentirely. In that moment she even seemed to him as if dead, and fear\r\nseized his heart. But it did not last long because, having heard the\r\npriest's voice repeat: \"_Ecce Agnus Dei_,\" his thoughts went toward God.\r\nIn the room there were heard only the solemn voice of Father Wyszoniek:\r\n\"_Domine, non sum dignus_,\" and with it the crackling of the logs in the\r\nfireplace and the sound of crickets playing obstinately, but sadly, in\r\nthe chinks of the chimney. Outdoors the wind arose and rustled in the\r\nsnowy forest, but soon stopped.\r\n\r\nZbyszko and Danusia remained sometime in silence; the _ksiondz_ Wyszoniek\r\ntook the chalice and carried it to the chapel of the mansion. After a\r\nwhile he returned accompanied by Sir de Lorche, and seeing astonishment\r\non the faces of those present, he placed his finger on his mouth, as if\r\nto stop the cry of surprise, then he said:\r\n\r\n\"I understand; it will be better to have two witnesses of the marriage; I\r\nwarned this knight who swore to me on his honor and on the relics of\r\nAguisgranum to keep the secret as long as necessary.\"\r\n\r\nThen Sir de Lorche first kneeled before the princess, then before\r\nDanusia; then he arose and stood silently, clad in his armor, on which\r\nthe red light of the fire was playing. He stood motionless, as if plunged\r\nin ecstasy, because for him also, that white girl with a wreath of\r\nimmortelles on her brow seemed like the picture of an angel, seen on the\r\nwindow of a Gothic cathedral.\r\n\r\nThe priest put her near Zbyszko's bed and having put the stole round\r\ntheir hands, began the customary rite. On the princess' honest face the\r\ntears were dropping one after another; but she was not uneasy within,\r\nbecause she believed she was doing well, uniting these two lovely and\r\ninnocent children. Sir de Lorche kneeled again, and leaning with both\r\nhands on the hilt of his sword, looked like a knight who beholds a\r\nvision. The young people repeated the priest's words: \"I ... take you\r\n...\" and those sweet quiet words were accompanied again by the singing of\r\nthe crickets in the chimney and the crackling in the fireplace. When the\r\nceremony was finished, Danusia fell at the feet of the princess who\r\nblessed them both, and finally intrusted them to the tutelage of heavenly\r\nmight; she said to Zbyszko:\r\n\r\n\"Now be merry, because she is yours, and you are hers.\"\r\n\r\nThen Zbyszko extended his well arm to Danusia, and she put her little\r\narms round his neck; for a while one could hear them repeat to each\r\nother:\r\n\r\n\"Danuska, you are mine!\"\r\n\r\n\"Zbyszku, you are mine!\"\r\n\r\nBut soon Zbyszko became weak, because there were too many emotions for\r\nhis strength, and having slipped on the pillow, he began to breathe\r\nheavily. But he did not faint, nor did he cease to smile at Danusia, who\r\nwas wiping his face which was covered with a cold perspiration, and he\r\ndid not stop repeating:\r\n\r\n\"Danuska, you are mine!\" to which every time she nodded her fair head in\r\nassent.\r\n\r\nThis sight greatly moved Sir de Lorche, who declared that in no other\r\ncountry had he seen such loving and tender hearts; therefore he solemnly\r\nswore that he was ready to fight on foot or on horseback with any knight,\r\nmagician or dragon, who would try to prevent their happiness. The\r\nprincess and Father Wyszoniek were witnesses of his oath.\r\n\r\nBut the lady, being unable to conceive of a marriage without some\r\nmerriment, brought some wine which they drank. The hours of night were\r\npassing on. Zbyszko having overcome his weakness, drew Danusia to him and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Since the Lord Jesus has given you to me, nobody can take you from me;\r\nbut I am sorry that you must leave me, my sweetest berry.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will come with _tatulo_ to Ciechanow,\" answered Danusia.\r\n\r\n\"If only you do not become sick--or--God may preserve you from some bad\r\naccident.--You must go to Spychow--I know! Hej! I must be thankful to God\r\nand to our gracious lady, that you are already mine--because we are\r\nmarried and no human force can break our marriage.\"\r\n\r\nBut as this marriage was performed secretly during the night and\r\nseparation was necessary immediately afterward, therefore from time to\r\ntime, not only Zbyszko, but everybody was filled with sadness. The\r\nconversation was broken. From time to time, also the fire was quenched\r\nand plunged all heads in obscurity. Then the _ksiondz_ Wyszoniek threw\r\nfresh logs on the charcoal and when something whined in the wood, as\r\nhappens very often when the wood is fresh, he said:\r\n\r\n\"Penitent soul, what do you wish?\"\r\n\r\nThe crickets answered him and the increasing flames which brought out\r\nfrom the shadow the sleepless faces, were reflected in Sir de Lorche's\r\narmor, lighting in the meanwhile Danusia's white dress and the\r\nimmortelles on her head.\r\n\r\nThe dogs outside again began to howl in the direction of the forest, as\r\nthey usually do, when they scent wolves.\r\n\r\nAs the hours of the night flew on, oftener there was silence; finally the\r\nprincess said:\r\n\r\n\"Sweet Jesus! We had better go to bed if we are going to sit like this\r\nafter a wedding, but as it was determined to watch until morning, then\r\nplay for us, my little flower, for the last time before your departure,\r\non the little lute--for me and for Zbyszko.\"\r\n\r\n\"What shall I play?\" asked she.\r\n\r\n\"What?\" said the princess. \"What else if not the same song which you sang\r\nin Tyniec, when Zbyszko saw you for the first time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hej! I remember--and shall never forget it,\" said Zbyszko. \"When I heard\r\nthat song somewhere else--I cried.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I will sing it!\" said Danusia.\r\n\r\nAnd immediately she began to thrum on the lute; then, having raised her\r\nlittle head, she sang:\r\n\r\n  \"If I only could get\r\n  The wings like a birdie,\r\n  I would fly quickly\r\n  To my dearest Jasiek!\r\n  I would then be seated\r\n  On the high enclosure;\r\n  Look, my dear Jasiulku,\r\n  Look on me, poor orphan.\"\r\n\r\nBut at once her voice broke, her mouth began to tremble and from beneath\r\nthe closed eyelids the tears began to flow down her cheeks. For a moment\r\nshe tried not to let them pass the eyelashes, but she could not keep them\r\nback and finally she began to cry, exactly as she did the last time she\r\nsang that song to Zbyszko in the prison in Krakow.\r\n\r\n\"Danuska! what is the matter, Danuska?\" asked Zbyszko.\r\n\r\n\"Why are you crying? Such a wedding!\" exclaimed the princess. \"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know,\" answered Danusia, sobbing. \"I am so sad! I regret\r\nZbyszko and you so much.\"\r\n\r\nThen all became very sorrowful; they began to console her, and to explain\r\nto her that she was not going to remain in Spychow a long time, but that\r\nthey would surely be with Jurand in Ciechanow for the holy days. Zbyszko\r\nagain encircled her with his arm, drew her to his breast and kissed the\r\ntears from her eyes; but the oppression remained in all hearts, and thus\r\nthe hours of night passed.\r\n\r\nFinally from the court-yard there resounded such a sudden and dreadful\r\nnoise, that all shivered. The princess, having rushed from the bench,\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"For God's sake. The sweeps of the wells! They are watering the horses!\"\r\n\r\nAnd the _ksiondz_ Wyszoniek looked through the window, in which the glass\r\nballs were growing gray and said:\r\n\r\n\"The night grows white and the day is coming. _Ave Maria, gratia\r\nplena_----\"\r\n\r\nThen he left the room but having returned after a while, he said:\r\n\r\n\"The day breaks, but the day will be dark. Jurand's people are watering\r\ntheir horses. Poor girl, you must be ready!\"\r\n\r\nThe princess and Danusia began to cry very loudly and both, together with\r\nZbyszko, began to lament, as simple people do when they have to separate;\r\nit was half lamenting and half singing, which flowed from full souls, in\r\na natural way, as the tears flow from the eyes.\r\n\r\n  \"Hej! there is no use of lamenting,\r\n  We must separate, my darling,\r\n             Farewell--hej!\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko nestled Danusia for the last time on his breast and kept her for\r\na long time, as long as he could breathe and until the princess drew her\r\nfrom him, in order to dress her for the journey.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile it was broad daylight.\r\n\r\nIn the mansion everybody was up and moving round. The Czech came to\r\nZbyszko to ask about his health and to ascertain what were his orders.\r\n\r\n\"Draw the bed to the window,\" said the knight to him.\r\n\r\nThe Czech drew the bed to the window, very easily; but he was surprised\r\nwhen Zbyszko told him to open it. He obeyed, however, only he covered his\r\nmaster with his own fur coat, because it was cold outside, although\r\ncloudy, and snow was falling.\r\n\r\nZbyszko began to look; in the court-yard, through the flakes of the\r\nfalling snow, one could see lights, and round them, on steaming horses,\r\nJurand's people were standing. All were armed. The forest was entirely\r\ncovered with the snow; one could hardly see the enclosures and the gate.\r\n\r\nDanusia, all wrapped up in furs, rushed once more into Zbyszko's room;\r\nonce more she put her arms around his neck and bade him farewell:\r\n\r\n\"Although I am going, still I am yours.\"\r\n\r\nHe kissed her hands, her cheeks and her eyes, and said:\r\n\r\n\"May God protect you! May God lead you! You are mine, mine until death!\"\r\n\r\nWhen they again separated them, he raised himself as much as he could,\r\nleaned his head on the window and looked out; consequently, through the\r\nflakes of the snow, as through a veil, he saw Danusia sitting in the\r\nsleigh, the princess holding her a long time in her arms, the ladies of\r\nthe court kissing her and the _ksiondz_ Wyszoniek making the sign of the\r\ncross for the journey. Before the departure, she turned once more toward\r\nhim, stretched out her arms and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Zbyszku, remain with God!\"\r\n\r\n\"May God permit me to see you in Ciechanow!\"\r\n\r\nBut the snow was falling abundantly, as though to deaden every sound, and\r\nto cover everything; therefore those last words came muffled to their\r\nears, so that it seemed to each of them that they were already calling to\r\neach other from afar.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF PART THIRD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART FOURTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nAfter abundant snowfalls, heavy frost and dry, clear days set in. By day\r\nthe wood sparkled in the rays of the sun, the ice fettered the rivers and\r\nhardened the marshes; serene nights followed in which the frost was\r\nintensified to such a degree that the wood in the forest cracked loudly.\r\nThe birds approached the dwelling-places. Wolves rendered the roads\r\nunsafe, gathering in packs and attacking not only solitary people, but\r\nalso villages. The people however enjoyed themselves at the firesides in\r\ntheir smoky shanties, presaging from the intensely cold winter an\r\nabundant year, and they waited gladly for the approaching holidays. The\r\nprincely Forest Court was deserted. The princess with the court and\r\npriest Wyszoniek left for Ciechanow. Zbyszko, who, though considerably\r\nimproved, was not yet strong enough to ride on horseback, remained in the\r\nForest Court together with Sanderus, his Bohemian armor-bearer and the\r\nservants of the place, who were under the superintendence of a\r\nnoble-woman fulfilling the household duties.\r\n\r\nBut the knight greatly yearned after his young wife. It is true, it was\r\nan immensely consoling thought to him that Danusia was already his, and\r\nthat no human power could take her from him; but, on the other hand, that\r\nsame thought intensified his longing. For whole days he hoped for that\r\nmoment when he should be able to leave the court, and pondered on what he\r\nshould then do, where to go, and how to appease Jurand. He had, likewise,\r\nbad and restless moments. But on the whole the future appeared joyful to\r\nhim. To love Danusia and pluck peacock plumes from helmets--such a life\r\nwould he lead. Many a time he desired to speak of it to his Bohemian whom\r\nhe loved, but he reflected, since the Bohemian, he thought, was with his\r\nwhole soul Jagienka's, it would be imprudent to speak to him about\r\nDanusia, but he, bound to secrecy, could not tell everything that\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\nHowever, his health improved daily. A week before Vigil (Christmas Eve)\r\nhe mounted his horse for the first time, and although he felt that he\r\ncould not do this in his armor, nevertheless he gathered confidence.\r\nBesides, he did not expect soon to be obliged to put on the coat of mail\r\nand helmet. At the worst he hoped soon to be strong enough to do that\r\ntoo. Indoors, in order to kill time, he attempted to lift up the sword,\r\nwhich he accomplished well, but the wielding of the axe seemed to him yet\r\na difficult task. Nevertheless, he believed that if he grasped the axe\r\nwith both hands he would be able to wield it effectively.\r\n\r\nFinally, two days before the Vigil, he gave orders to repair the\r\ncarriage, saddle the horses, and notified the Bohemian that they were\r\ngoing to Ciechanow. The faithful armor-bearer was somewhat anxious, the\r\nmore so on account of the intense frost out-of-doors. But Zbyszko said to\r\nhim:\r\n\r\n\"Glowacz,[105] it concerns not your head, there is nothing for us in this\r\ncourt, and even should I happen to be sick, I would not miss seeing the\r\nold gentleman in Ciechanow. Moreover, I shall not ride on horseback, but\r\nin a sleigh, up to the neck in hay and under furs, and only when quite\r\nnear Ciechanow shall I mount my horse.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so it happened. The Bohemian knew his young master and was aware that\r\nit was not good to oppose him, and still worse not to attend scrupulously\r\nto his orders. Therefore they started at an early hour. At the moment of\r\ndeparture, Zbyszko seeing Sanderus placing himself and his boxes in the\r\nsleigh, said to him: \"Why are you sticking to me like burs to sheep's\r\nwool?... You told me you wished to go to Prussia.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I said so,\" Sanderus replied. \"But can I get there alone in such\r\nsnows? The wolves would devour me before the first star made its\r\nappearance, and I have nothing to stay here for. I prefer the town, to\r\nedify the people in godliness, and bestow upon them my holy wares and\r\nrescue them from the devil's grasp, as I have sworn to the father of all\r\nChristendom in Rome. Besides this, I am exceedingly attached to your\r\ngrace, whom I shall not leave before my return to Rome, for it may happen\r\nthat I may be enabled to render you some service.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is always for you, sir! He is ready to eat and drink for you,\" said\r\nthe Bohemian. \"Such service he would be too glad to render, but if a pack\r\nof wolves should happen to attack us in the forests near Przasnysz then I\r\nshall feed the wolves with him, for he is unfit for anything else.\"\r\n\r\n\"Better take care that the sinful words don't freeze to your moustache,\"\r\nreplied Sanderus, \"for such icicles can only melt in hellfire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Owa!\" replied Glowacz, reaching with his gauntlet to his incipient\r\nmoustache, \"I shall first try to warm some beer for refreshment, but I'll\r\ngive none to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it is forbidden there to give drink to the thirsty,--another sin.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall give you a pail full of water, but meanwhile take what I have in\r\nmy hand!\" Thus saying he gathered as much snow as he could hold with both\r\ngauntlets and threw it at Sanderus' beard, but the latter bent aside and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing for _you_ in Ciechanow, for there is already a grown-up\r\nbear that plays with snow.\"\r\n\r\nThus they loved to tease each other. But Zbyszko did not forbid Sanderus\r\nto ride with him because that strange man amused him, and at the same\r\ntime it seemed to him that the man was really attached to him.\r\n\r\nThey moved from the Forest Court in the bright morning. The frost was so\r\nintense that they had to cover the horses. The whole landscape was under\r\nsnow. The roofs of the cottages were covered and hardly visible. Smoke\r\nseemed to issue directly from white hills, shooting up skyward, red-hued\r\nin the morning, widening out on the roof like a brush, and looking like\r\nthe plumes on helmets.\r\n\r\nZbyszko sat in the sleigh, first to gather strength, secondly on account\r\nof the severe cold, against which it was easy to protect oneself; he\r\ncommanded Glowacz to sit down beside him so as to be ready with the\r\ncrossbow against an attack of wolves, meanwhile he chatted with him\r\nmerrily.\r\n\r\n\"In Przasnysz, we shall only feed the horses and warm ourselves a little\r\nand then immediately continue our journey.\"\r\n\r\n\"To Ciechanow?\"\r\n\r\n\"First to Ciechanow, to pay homage to the court and attend worship.\"\r\n\r\n\"After that?\" inquired Glowacz.\r\n\r\nZbyszko smiled and replied,\r\n\r\n\"Afterward, who knows, may be to Bogdaniec.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bohemian looked at him with astonishment, the thought crossed his\r\nmind: Maybe he has quarrelled with Jurandowna, and this seemed to him\r\nmost likely, because she had gone away. The Bohemian had also heard in\r\nthe Forest Court that the lord of Spychow was opposed to the young\r\nknight, therefore the honest armor-bearer was glad although he loved\r\nJagienka, but he looked upon her as upon a star in heaven for whose\r\nhappiness he was willing even to shed his blood. He therefore loved\r\nZbyszko, and from his very soul he longed to serve both of them even unto\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n\"Then your grace thinks to settle down on the estate,\" he exultingly\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\"How can I settle down on my estate,\" replied Zbyszko, \"when I challenged\r\nthose Knights of the Cross, and even before that, I challenged\r\nLichtenstein. De Lorche said that the Master would invite the king to\r\nvisit Torun. I shall attach myself to the king's retinue, and I think\r\nthat at Torun, either _Pan_ Zawisza of Garbow or Powala of Taczew will\r\nask permission from our lord to allow me to fight those monks. They will\r\ncertainly come to fight accompanied by their armor-bearers; in that case\r\nyou will also have to meet them.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I were to kill any one, I should like him to be a monk,\" said the\r\nBohemian.\r\n\r\nZbyszko looked at him with satisfaction. \"Well, he will not fare well who\r\nhappens to feel your steel. God has given you great strength, but you\r\nwould act badly if you were to push it to excess, because humility is\r\nbecoming in the worthy armor-bearer.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bohemian shook his head as a sign that he would not waste his\r\nstrength, but would not spare it against the Germans.\r\n\r\nZbyszko smiled, not on account of what the armor bearer had said, but at\r\nhis own thoughts.\r\n\r\n\"The old gentleman will be glad when we return, and in Zgorzelice there\r\nwill also be joy.\"\r\n\r\nJagienka stood before Zbyszko's eyes as though she were sitting with him\r\nin the sleigh. That always happened, whenever he thought of her he saw\r\nher very distinctly.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he said to himself, \"she will not be glad, for when I shall\r\nreturn to Bogdaniec it will be with Danusia. Let her take somebody\r\nelse....\" Here, the figures of Wills of Brzozowa, and young Cztan of\r\nRogow passed through his mind, and suddenly a disagreeable feeling crept\r\nover him, because the girl might fall into the hands of one of them, and\r\nhe said to himself: \"I wish I could find some better man, for those\r\nfellows are beer-gulpers and gourmands, and the girl is upright.\" And he\r\nthought of this and of that; of his uncle when he should learn what had\r\nhappened, it would be irksome, no matter how it turned out; but he\r\nimmediately consoled himself with the thought that with his uncle,\r\nmatters concerning kinship and wealth were always paramount, and these\r\ncould advance the interest of the family. Jagienka was indeed nearer, but\r\nJurand was a greater land owner than Zych of Zgorzelice. Moreover the\r\nformer could easily foresee that Macko could not be long opposed to such\r\na liaison, the more so when he should behold his nephew's love for\r\nDanusia and her requital. He would grumble for a while, then he would be\r\nglad and begin to love Danuska as his own daughter.\r\n\r\nSuddenly his heart was moved with tenderness and yearning toward that\r\nuncle who although a severe man, loved him like the pupil of his own eye;\r\nthat uncle cared for him on the battlefield more than for himself, he\r\ntook booty for him, and for his sake he was driven out from his estate.\r\nBoth of them were lonely in the world without near relatives, with only\r\ndistant ones like the abbot. Moreover, when the time arrived to separate\r\nfrom each other, neither of them knew what to do, particularly the older\r\none, who no more desired anything for himself.\r\n\r\n\"Hej! he will be glad, he will be glad!\" repeated Zbyszko to himself.\r\n\"Only one thing I should like,--that he should receive Jurand and me as\r\nwell as he would receive me by myself.\"\r\n\r\nThen he attempted to imagine what Jurand would say and do when he learned\r\nof the marriage. There was some alarm in this thought, but not too much\r\nof it, for the simple reason that it was an accomplished fact. It would\r\nnot do for Jurand to challenge him to fight, and even should Jurand\r\noppose, Zbyszko could answer him thus: \"Forbear, I ask you; your right to\r\nDanuska is human, but mine is divine; she is therefore no more yours, but\r\nmine.\" He once heard from a certain clergyman who was versed in the\r\nScriptures that the woman must leave her father and mother and go with\r\nher husband. He felt therefore that the greater part of strength was in\r\nhis favor; nevertheless he did not expect that intense strife and passion\r\nwould arise between Jurand and himself, for he counted upon Danusia's\r\npetition which would be granted, and quite as much, if not more, upon\r\nthat which would be obtained by the intercession of the prince under whom\r\nJurand was serving and that of the princess whom Jurand loved as the\r\nprotectress of his child.\r\n\r\nOwing to the severe frosts, wolves appeared in such great packs, that\r\nthey even attacked people traveling together. Zbyszko was advised to\r\nremain over night at Przasnysz, but he took no notice of it, because it\r\nhappened that, at the inn, they met some Mazovian knights with their\r\ntrains who were also on their way to meet the prince at Ciechanow, and\r\nsome armed merchants from that very place convoying loaded wagons from\r\nPrussia. There was no danger to travel with such a great crowd; they\r\ntherefore started toward evening, although a sudden wind arose after\r\nnightfall which chased the clouds, and snow began to fall. They traveled\r\nkeeping close to one another, but they advanced so slowly that it\r\noccurred to Zbyszko that they would not arrive in time for the Vigil.\r\nThey were obliged to dig through the drift in some places where it was\r\nimpossible for the horses to pass through. Fortunately the road in the\r\nwoods was not obliterated. It was already dusk when they saw Ciechanow.\r\n\r\nWere it not for the fire on the heights where the new castle stood, they\r\nwould not have known that they were so close to town, and would have\r\nstrayed much longer in the midst of the blinding snowstorm and gust of\r\nwind. They were not sure whether fire was burning there in honor of the\r\nguests at Christmas Eve, or whether it was put there according to some\r\nancient custom. But none of Zbyszko's companions thought about it, for\r\nall were anxious to find a place of shelter in town as quickly as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the snowstorm constantly increased, the keen, freezing wind\r\ncarried immense snowclouds; it dragged at the trees, it howled, maddened,\r\nit tore whole snowdrifts, carrying them upward, it shifted, heaved up,\r\nand almost covered the sleighs and horses and struck the faces of the\r\noccupants like sharp gravel; it stifled their breath and speech. The\r\nsound of the bells fastened to the poles of the sleighs could not be\r\nheard at all, but instead of it there were audible, in the midst of the\r\nhowling and whistling of the whirlwind, plaintive voices like the howling\r\nof wolves, like distant neighing of horses, and at times like human\r\nvoices in great distress, calling for help. The exhausted horses began to\r\npant, and gradually slacken their pace.\r\n\r\n\"Hej! what a blizzard! what a blizzard!\" said the Bohemian in a choking\r\nvoice. \"It is fortunate, sir, that we are already near the town, and that\r\nyonder fires are burning; if it were not for that we should fare badly.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is death for those who are in the field,\" answered Zbyszko, \"but\r\neven the fire I don't see there any more. The gloom is so thick that even\r\nthe fire is invisible; perhaps the wood and coal were swept away by the\r\nwind.\"\r\n\r\nThe merchants and knights in the other wagons were saying: that should\r\nthe snowstorm carry off anybody from the seat, that one would never hear\r\nthe morning bell. But Zbyszko became suddenly alarmed and said:\r\n\r\n\"God forbid that Jurand should be anywhere on the road!\"\r\n\r\nThe Bohemian, although entirely occupied in looking toward the fire, on\r\nhearing the words of Zbyszko, turned his head and asked:\r\n\r\n\"Is the knight of Spychow expected?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"With the young lady?\"\r\n\r\n\"And the fire is really gone,\" answered Zbyszko.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed the fire was extinguished, but, instead, several horsemen\r\nappeared immediately in front of the horses and sleighs.\r\n\r\n\"Why dost thou follow?\" cried the watchful Bohemian, grasping his\r\ncrossbow; \"Who are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"The prince's people, sent to assist the travelers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jesus Christ be praised!\"\r\n\r\n\"Forever and ever.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lead us to town,\" said Zbyszko.\r\n\r\n\"Is there nobody left behind?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nobody.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whence do you come?\"\r\n\r\n\"From Przasnysz.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you not meet other travelers on the road?\"\r\n\r\n\"We met nobody, but they may be on other roads.\"\r\n\r\n\"People are searching on all roads, come with us, you lost your route! To\r\nthe right.\"\r\n\r\nThey turned the horses, and for some time nothing was perceptible but the\r\nblast of the storm.\r\n\r\n\"Are there many guests in the castle?\" asked Zbyszko, after a while.\r\n\r\nThe nearest horseman, who did not hear the question bent toward him.\r\n\r\n\"What did you say, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"I asked whether there were many guests at the prince's?\"\r\n\r\n\"As customary: there are enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"But is the lord of Spychow there?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is not there, but they expect him. People ware dispatched to meet him\r\ntoo.\"\r\n\r\n\"With torches?\"\r\n\r\n\"If the weather permits.\"\r\n\r\nThey were unable to continue their conversation, for the boisterous\r\nsnowstorm was increasing in force.\r\n\r\n\"Quite a devil's marriage,\" said the Bohemian. Zbyszko, however, told him\r\nto keep quiet, and not to conjure up the evil name.\r\n\r\n\"Dost thou not know,\" he said, \"that on such a Holy Day, the devil's\r\npower is subdued, and the devils hide themselves in the ice-holes? Once\r\nthe fishermen near Sandomierz on Christmas Eve found him in their net, he\r\nhad a pike in his mouth, but when the sound of the bells reached his\r\nears, he immediately fainted; they pounded him with their clubs till the\r\nevening. The tempest is certainly vehement, but it is with the permission\r\nof the Lord Jesus, who desires that the morrow shall be the more joyful.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah! we were quite near the city,\" said Glowacz. \"Yet if it were not for\r\nthese people, we should have strayed till midnight, since we had deviated\r\nfrom the right path.\"\r\n\r\n\"Because the fire was extinguished.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile they arrived in town. The snowdrifts in the streets were\r\nlarger, so big that in some places they even covered the windows, so much\r\nso that the wayfarers could not see the light from within. But the storm\r\nwas not so much felt here. The streets were deserted. The inhabitants\r\nwere already celebrating the Christmas Eve festival. In front of some\r\nhouses, boys with small cribs and goats, in spite of the snowstorm, were\r\nsinging Christmas hymns. In the market-place there were seen men wrapped\r\nup in pease straw imitating bears; otherwise the streets were deserted.\r\nThe merchants who accompanied Zbyszko and the noblemen on the road,\r\nremained in town, but they continued their journey toward the prince's\r\nresidence in the old castle, and, as the windows of the castle were made\r\nof glass, the bright light, notwithstanding the blizzard, cast its rays\r\nupon the advancing party.\r\n\r\nThe drawbridge over the moat was lowered, because the Lithuanian\r\nincursions of old had diminished, and the Knights of the Cross, who\r\ncarried on war against the King of Poland, were now themselves seeking\r\nthe friendship of the Prince of Mazowsze. One of the prince's men blew\r\nthe horn and immediately the gate was opened. There were in it several\r\narchers, but upon the walls and palisades there was not a living soul\r\nwhen the prince permitted the guard to go out. Old Mrokota, who had\r\narrived two days before, went out to meet the guests, and greeted them in\r\nthe name of the prince and brought them into the house where they could\r\nprepare themselves properly for table.\r\n\r\nZbyszko immediately asked him for news of Jurand of Spychow, but he\r\nreplied that he had not arrived, but was expected because he promised to\r\ncome, and that if he were very ill he would send word. Nevertheless\r\nseveral horsemen were sent out to meet him, for even the oldest men did\r\nnot remember such a blizzard.\r\n\r\n\"Then he may soon be here.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe he will soon be here. The princess ordered dishes for them\r\nnear the common table.\"\r\n\r\nBut Zbyszko, although he was somewhat anxious about Jurand, was\r\nnevertheless glad in his heart, and said to himself: \"Though I do not\r\nknow what to do, yet one thing is certain, my wife is coming, my woman,\r\nmy most beloved Danuska.\" When he repeated those words to himself, he\r\ncould hardly believe his own happiness. Why, he reflected, it may be that\r\nshe has already confessed all to her father, she may have moved him to\r\npity and begged him to give her up at once. \"In truth, what else could he\r\ndo? Jurand is a clever fellow, he knows, that although he keeps her from\r\nme, I shall nevertheless take her away, for my right is stronger.\"\r\n\r\nWhilst he was dressing himself he conversed with Mrokota, inquiring after\r\nthe prince's health and specially that of the princess, whom he loved\r\nlike his mother since that time when he sojourned in Krakow. He was glad\r\nto learn that everybody in the castle was well and cheerful, although the\r\nprincess greatly yearned after her beloved songstress. Jagienka now\r\nplayed the lute for her and the princess loved her much, but not as much\r\nas the songstress.\r\n\r\n\"Which Jagienka?\" inquired Zbyszko with astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"Jagienka of Wielgolasu, the granddaughter of the old lord of Wielgolasu.\r\nShe is a fine girl. The Lotarynczyk[106] fell in love with her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then is Sir de Lorche here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Where then should he be? He has been here since he arrived from the\r\nForest Court, for it is well to be here. Our prince never lacks guests.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall be glad to see him, he is a knight with whom none can find\r\nfault.\"\r\n\r\n\"And he also loves you. But let us go, their Highnesses will soon be at\r\nthe table.\"\r\n\r\nThey went into the dining hall where big fires burned in the two\r\nfireplaces and they were taken care of by the servants.\r\n\r\nThe room was already filled with guests and courtiers. The prince entered\r\nfirst accompanied by the Voyevode and several life guards. Zbyszko knelt\r\nand kissed his hands.\r\n\r\nThe prince pressed Zbyszko's head, then he took him aside and said:\r\n\r\n\"I know it all already, I was displeased at first, because it was done\r\nwithout my permission, but there was no time, for I was then in Warsaw\r\nwhere I intended to spend the holidays. It is a well-known fact that, if\r\na woman desires anything, opposition is useless, and you gain nothing by\r\nit. The princess wishes you well like a mother, and I always desire to\r\nplease rather than to oppose her wishes, in order to spare her trouble\r\nand tears.\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko bowed again to the prince's knees.\r\n\r\n\"God grant that I may requite your princely love.\"\r\n\r\n\"Praise His name that you are already well. Tell the princess how I\r\nreceived you with good wishes, so that she may be pleased. As I fear God,\r\nher joy is my joy! I shall also say a good word in your behalf to Jurand,\r\nand I think that he will consent, for he too loves the princess.\"\r\n\r\n\"Even if he refused to give her to me, my right stands first.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your right stands first and must be acknowledged, but a blessing might\r\nfail you. Nobody can forcibly wrest her from you, but without a father's\r\nblessing God's is also lacking.\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko felt uneasy on hearing these words, for he had never before\r\nthought about it; but at that moment the princess entered, accompanied by\r\nJagienka of Wielgolasu and other court ladies; he hastened to bow before\r\nher, but she greeted him even more graciously than the prince had done,\r\nand at once began to tell him of the expectation of Jurand's arrival.\r\n\"Here are the covers ready for him, and people have been dispatched to\r\nguide them through the snowdrifts. We shall not wait any longer for them\r\nwith the Christmas Eve supper, for the prince does not approve of it, but\r\nthey will be here before supper is over.\"\r\n\r\n\"As far as Jurand is concerned,\" continued the princess, \"he will be here\r\nin God's good time. But I shall tell him all to-day or to-morrow after\r\nthe shepherd service (pasterce), and the prince also promised to say a\r\nword in your behalf. Jurand is obstinate but not with those whom he\r\nloves, nor those to whom he owes obedience.\"\r\n\r\nThen she began to instruct Zbyszko how he should act with his\r\nfather-in-law, and that God forbid he should anger him or rouse his\r\nobstinacy. It was apparently good advice, but an experienced eye looking\r\nat Zbyszko and then at her could discern in her words and looks a certain\r\nalarm. It may be because the lord of Spychow was not an accommodating\r\nman, and it may also be that the princess was somewhat uneasy at his\r\nnon-appearance. The storm increased in strength, and all declared that if\r\nany one were caught in the open country he would not survive. The\r\nprincess, however, concluded that Danuska had confessed to her father her\r\nmarriage to Zbyszko, and he being offended, was resolved not to proceed\r\nto Ciechanow. The princess however, did not desire to reveal her thoughts\r\nto Zbyszko; there was not even time to do so, for the servants brought in\r\nthe viands and placed them on the table. Nevertheless Zbyszko endeavored\r\nto follow her up and make further inquiries.\r\n\r\n\"And if they arrive, what will happen then, beloved lady? Mrokota told me\r\nthat there are special quarters set apart for Jurand; there will be hay\r\nenough for bedding for the chilled horses. How then will it be?\"\r\n\r\nThe princess laughed and tapped him lightly on the face with her glove\r\nand said: \"Be quiet, do you see him?\"\r\n\r\nAnd she went toward the prince and was assisted to a chair. One of the\r\nattendants placed before the prince a flat dish with thin slices of cake,\r\nand wafers, which he was to distribute among the guests, courtiers and\r\nservants. Another attendant held before the prince a beautiful boy, the\r\nson of the castellan of Sokhochova. On the other side of the table stood\r\nFather Wyszoniek who was to pronounce a benediction upon the fragrant\r\nsupper.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, a man covered with snow entered and cried: \"Most Gracious\r\nPrince!\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" said the prince. \"Is there no reverence; they have\r\ninterrupted him in his religious ceremonies.\"\r\n\r\n\"Some travelers are snowbound on the road to Radzanow, we need people to\r\nhelp us to dig them out.\"\r\n\r\nOn hearing this all were seized with fear--the prince was alarmed, and\r\nturning toward the castellan of Sokhochova, he commanded:\r\n\r\n\"Horses and spades! Hasten!\"\r\n\r\nThen he said to the man who brought the news: \"Are there many under the\r\nsnow?\"\r\n\r\n\"I could not tell, it blew terribly; there are a considerable number of\r\nhorses and wagons.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you not know who they are?\"\r\n\r\n\"People say that they belong to Jurand of Spychow.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nWhen Zbyszko heard the ill tidings, he did not even ask the prince's\r\npermission, but hastened to the stable and ordered his horse to be\r\nsaddled. The Bohemian, being a noble-born armor-bearer, met Zbyszko in\r\nthe hall before he returned to the house, and brought him a warm fur\r\ncoat, yet he did not attempt to detain his young master, for he possessed\r\nstrong natural sense; he knew that detention would be of no avail, and\r\nonly loss of time, he therefore mounted the second horse and seized some\r\ntorches from the guard at the gate, and started at once together with the\r\nprince's men who were under the management of the old castellan.\r\nImpenetrable darkness enveloped them beyond the gate, but the storm\r\nseemed to them to have moderated; were it not for the man who notified\r\nthem of the accident, they would have lost their way at once; but he had\r\na trained dog with him which being acquainted with the road, enabled him\r\nto proceed safely and quickly. In the open field the storm again\r\nincreased and began to cut their faces. It may be because they galloped.\r\nThe road was filled with snow, so much so that in some places they were\r\nobliged to slacken their speed, for the horses sank up to their bellies\r\nin snow. The prince's people lighted their torches and fire-pots and\r\nmoved on amid smoke and flames; the wind blew with such force as though\r\nit endeavored to tear the flames from the torches and carry them over the\r\nfield and forest. It was a long journey. They passed the settlement near\r\nCiechanow, then they passed Niedzborz, then they turned toward Radzanow.\r\n\r\nThe storm began really to subside beyond Niedzborz; the gusts of wind\r\nwere less frequent and no longer carried immense snowclouds. The sky\r\ncleared. Some snow yet drifted from the hills, but it soon ceased. The\r\nstars appeared here and there between the broken clouds. The horses began\r\nto snort, the horsemen breathed freely. The stars came out by degrees and\r\nit began to freeze. In a short time the storm subsided entirely.\r\n\r\nSir de Lorche who rode beside Zbyszko began to comfort him, saying, that\r\nJurand undoubtedly in moments of peril thought of his daughter's safety\r\nabove everything, and although all those buried in the snow should be\r\nfound dead, she undoubtedly would be discovered alive, probably sleeping\r\nin her fur robes. But Zbyszko understood him not, in fact he had no time\r\nto listen to him. When, after a little while, the guide who was riding in\r\nfront of them turned from the road, the young knight moved in front and\r\ninquired:\r\n\r\n\"Why do we deviate from the road?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because they are not covered up on the road, but yonder! Do you observe\r\nthat clump of alders?\"\r\n\r\nAnd he pointed with his hand to the darkening in the distant thicket\r\nwhich could be seen plainly on the white snow-covered expanse, when the\r\nclouds unveiled the moon's disk and the night became clear.\r\n\r\n\"They have apparently wandered from the road; they turned aside and moved\r\nin a small circle along the river; in the wind and drifting snow, it is\r\nquite easy to go astray. They moved on and on as long as the horses did\r\nnot give out.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did you find them?\"\r\n\r\n\"The dog led us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are there any huts near here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but they are on the other side of the river. Close here is Wkra.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whip up the horses,\" commanded Zbyszko.\r\n\r\nBut the command was easier than the execution of the order. The piled up\r\nsnow upon the meadow was not yet frozen firm, and the horses sank\r\nknee-deep in the drifts; they were therefore obliged to move slowly.\r\nSuddenly they heard the barking of a dog; directly in front of them there\r\nwas the deformed thick stump of a willow-tree upon which glistened in the\r\nlight of the moon a crown of leafless twigs.\r\n\r\n\"They are farther off,\" said the guide, \"they are near the alder clump,\r\nbut it seems that here also there might be something.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is much drift under the willow-tree. Bring a light.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral attendants dismounted and lit up the place with their torches.\r\nOne of them soon exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"There is a man under the snow, his head is visible. Here!\"\r\n\r\n\"There is also a horse,\" said another.\r\n\r\n\"Dig them out!\"\r\n\r\nThey began to remove the snow with their spades and throw it aside.\r\n\r\nIn a moment they observed a human being under the tree, his head upon his\r\nchest, and his cap pulled down over his face. One hand held the reins of\r\nthe horse that lay beside him with its nostrils buried in the snow. It\r\nwas obvious that the man must have left the company, probably with the\r\nobject of reaching a human habitation as quickly as possible in order to\r\nsecure help, and when the horse fell he had then taken refuge under the\r\nlee of the willow-tree.\r\n\r\n\"Light!\" shouted Zbyszko.\r\n\r\nThe attendant brought the torch near the face of the frozen man, but his\r\nfeatures could not be distinguished. Only when a second attendant lifted\r\nthe head from the chest, they all exclaimed with one accord:\r\n\r\n\"It is the lord of Spychow!\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko ordered two of his men to carry him to the nearest hut and try to\r\nresuscitate him, but himself lost no time but hastened with the rest of\r\nthe attendants and the guide to rescue the rest of the retinue. On the\r\nway it crossed Zbyszko's mind that perhaps he might find his wife Danuska\r\ndead, and he urged on his horse who waded up to his breast in snow, to\r\nhis last breath.\r\n\r\nFortunately it was not distant, a few furlongs at most. In the darkness\r\nvoices were heard exclaiming: \"_Byway_.\"[107] They were those who had\r\nbeen left with the snow-covered people.\r\n\r\nZbyszko rushed in and jumped from his horse and shouted:\r\n\r\n\"To the spades!\"\r\n\r\nTwo sleighs were dug out before they reached those in the rear. The\r\nhorses and the people in the sleighs were frozen to death, and past all\r\nhope of reviving. The place where the other teams were could be\r\nrecognized by the heaps of snow, though not all the sleighs were entirely\r\ncovered with snow; in front of some of the sleighs were the horses up to\r\ntheir bellies, in the posture of their last effort to run. In front of\r\none team there stood a man up to his belt in snow, holding a lance and\r\nmotionless as a post; in front of the others were dead attendants holding\r\nthe horses by their muzzles. Death had apparently overtaken them at the\r\nmoment when they attempted to extricate the horses from the drifts. One\r\nteam, at the very end of the train, was not at all in the drift. The\r\ndriver sat in front bent, his hands protecting his ears, but in the rear\r\nlay two people, who, owing to the continuous, long snow-fall, were\r\ncompletely covered. On their breasts, to escape the drift, they lay\r\nclosely side by side, and the snow covered them like a blanket. They\r\nseemed to be sleeping peacefully. But others perished, struggling hard\r\nwith the snow-drift to the last moment, their benumbed position\r\ndemonstrated the fact. A few sleighs were upset, others had their poles\r\nbroken. The spades now and then uncovered horses' backs, bent like bows,\r\nand jaws biting the snow. People were within and beside the sleighs. But\r\nthere was no woman in any of the sleighs. At times even Zbyszko labored\r\nwith the spade till his brow was covered with perspiration, and at others\r\nhe looked with palpitating heart into the eyes of the corpses, perchance\r\nto discover the face of his beloved. But all in vain. The faces which the\r\ntorchlight revealed were those of whiskered soldiers of Spychow. Neither\r\nDanusia nor any other woman was there.\r\n\r\n\"What does it mean?\" the young knight asked himself with astonishment.\r\n\r\nHe hailed those working at a distance and inquired whether they had come\r\nacross anything else, but they too only found the corpses of men. At last\r\nthe work was finished. The servants hitched their own horses to the\r\nsleighs, placed the corpses in them and drove to Niedzborz, to make an\r\nattempt there in the warm mansion, to restore some of the dead to life.\r\nZbyszko, the Bohemian and two attendants remained. It crossed his mind\r\nthat the sleigh containing Danusia might have separated from the train,\r\nor that Jurand's sleigh, as might be supposed, was drawn by his best\r\nhorses and had been ordered to drive in front; and it might also be that\r\nJurand had left her somewhere in one of the huts along the road. Zbyszko\r\ndid not know what to do. In any case he desired to examine closely the\r\ndrifts and grove, and then return and search along the road.\r\n\r\nBut nothing was found in the drifts. In the grove he only saw several\r\nglistening wolves' eyes, but nowhere discovered any traces of people or\r\nhorses. The meadow between the woods and road now sparkled in the shiny\r\nlight of the moon, and upon its white mournful cover he really espied\r\ndark spots, but those were only wolves that quickly vanished at the\r\napproach of people.\r\n\r\n\"Your grace!\" finally said the Bohemian. \"Our search is in vain, for the\r\nyoung lady of Spychow was not in the train.\"\r\n\r\n\"To the road!\" replied Zbyszko.\r\n\r\n\"We shall not find her there either. I looked well in the sleighs for any\r\nbaskets containing ladies' finery, but I discovered none. The young lady\r\nremained in Spychow.\"\r\n\r\nThis supposition struck Zbyszko as correct, he therefore said:\r\n\r\n\"God grant it to be as you say!\"\r\n\r\nBut the Bohemian penetrated further into his thoughts, and proceeded with\r\nhis reasoning.\r\n\r\n\"If she were in one of the sleighs the old gentleman would not have\r\nseparated from her, or when he left the train he would have taken her\r\nwith him on horseback, and we should have found her with him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, let us go there once more,\" said Zbyszko, in a restless voice. It\r\nstruck him that the Bohemian might be right, perhaps they had not\r\nsearched enough where the old man was discovered, perhaps Jurand had\r\ntaken Danusia with him on horseback, and when the horse fell, she had\r\nleft her father in search of assistance, in that case she might be\r\nsomewhere under the snow in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nBut Glowacz as though divining his thoughts, said:\r\n\r\n\"In such a case ladies' apparel would have been found in the sleighs,\r\nbecause she would not have left for the court with only her traveling\r\ndress.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of these reasonable suppositions they returned to the\r\nwillow-tree, but neither there nor for a furlong around did they discover\r\nanything. The prince's people had already taken Jurand to Niedzborz, and\r\nthe whole neighborhood was a complete desolation. The Bohemian observed\r\nfurther, that the dog that ran ahead of the guide and found Jurand would\r\nalso have discovered the young lady. Then Zbyszko breathed freely, for he\r\nwas almost sure that Danusia had remained at home. He was even able to\r\nexplain why she did so. Danusia had confessed all to her father, and he\r\nwas not satisfied with the marriage, and so purposely left her at home,\r\nand went by himself to see the prince and bring an action, and ask for\r\nhis intercession with the bishop. At this thought Zbyszko could not help\r\nfeeling a certain sense of relief, and even gladness, when he\r\ncomprehended that by reason of Jurand's death all hindrances had\r\nvanished. \"Jurand was unwilling, but the Lord Jesus wants it,\" said the\r\nyoung knight to himself, \"and God's will is always the strongest.\" Now,\r\nhe had only to go to Spychow and fetch Danuska as his own and then\r\ncomplete the nuptials. It is even easier to marry her on the frontier\r\nthan there in the distant Bogdaniec. \"God's will! God's will!\" he\r\nrepeated in his soul. But suddenly he felt ashamed of this premature joy\r\nand turned to the Bohemian and said:\r\n\r\n\"Certainly I am sorry for him and I proclaim it aloud.\"\r\n\r\n\"They say that the Germans feared him like death,\" replied the Bohemian.\r\n\r\nPresently he inquired:\r\n\r\n\"Shall we now return to the castle?\"\r\n\r\n\"By way of Niedzborz,\" answered Zbyszko. When they called at Niedzborz\r\nand then left for the court, where the old proprietor Zelech received\r\nthem, they did not find Jurand, but Zelech told them good news.\r\n\r\n\"They first rubbed him with snow almost to the bones, then poured wine\r\ninto his mouth and then put him in a scalding bath where he began to\r\nbreathe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is he alive?\" joyfully asked Zbyszko, who on hearing the news forgot his\r\nown interests.\r\n\r\n\"He lives, but as to his continuing to live God only knows, for the soul\r\nthat has arrived half way is unwilling to return.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did they remove him?\"\r\n\r\n\"The prince sent for him, and they have wrapped him up in as many feather\r\nblankets as they could find in the house and carried him away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he say anything about his daughter?\"\r\n\r\n\"He only began to breathe but did not recover speech.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the others?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are already with God, and the poor fellows will no more be able to\r\nattend the _pasterce_ (Christmas Eve feast) unless at that which the Lord\r\nJesus Himself will prepare in heaven.\"\r\n\r\n\"None else survived?\"\r\n\r\n\"None. Come into the entrance hall, the place to converse, and if you\r\nwish to see them, they lie along the fireside in the servants' room. Come\r\ninside.\"\r\n\r\nBut they were in a hurry and did not wish to enter, although old Zelech\r\ninsisted, for he was glad to get hold of people in order to chat with\r\nthem. There was yet, quite a considerable distance from Niedzborz to\r\nCiechanow, and Zbyszko was burning like fire to see Jurand as soon as\r\npossible and learn something from him.\r\n\r\nThey therefore rode as fast as they could along the snow-covered road.\r\nWhen they arrived it was already after midnight, and the Christmas feast\r\n(lit-Shepherd ceremony) was just ended in the castle chapel. Zbyszko\r\nheard the lowing of oxen and the bleating of goats, which voices were\r\nproduced in accordance with the ancient religious custom, in remembrance\r\nthat the nativity took place in a stable. After the mass, the princess\r\ncame to Zbyszko. She looked distressed and frightened, and began to\r\nquestion him:\r\n\r\n\"And Danuska?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is she not here, has Jurand said nothing, for according to what I\r\ngathered she lives?\"\r\n\r\n\"Merciful Jesus!... God's punishment and woe to us! Jurand has not spoken\r\nand he lies like a log.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fear not, gracious lady. Danuska remained in Spychow.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because there is no trace of ladies' apparel found in any of the\r\nsleighs; she could not have left with only her traveling dress.\"\r\n\r\n\"True, as God is dear to me!\"\r\n\r\nHer eyes immediately were lit up with joy and after a while she\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Hej! It seems that Christ the Infant, who was born to-day is not angry\r\nwith you, but has a blessing upon us!\"\r\n\r\nThe only thing which surprised her was the presence of Jurand without his\r\ndaughter. Then she continued questioning him:\r\n\r\n\"What caused him to leave her at home?\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko explained to her his own reason, which seemed to her just, but\r\nshe did not comprehend it sufficiently.\r\n\r\n\"Jurand will now be thankful to us for his life,\" she said, \"and forsooth\r\nhe owes it to you because you went to dig him out. His heart would be of\r\nstone if he were still to continue his opposition to you. In this there\r\nis also God's warning to him not to oppose the holy sacrament. I shall\r\ntell him so as soon as he comes to his senses and is able to speak.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is necessary for him first to recover consciousness, because we do\r\nnot yet know why he has not brought Danuska with him. Perhaps she is\r\nsick?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not say that something has happened I I feel so much troubled that\r\nshe is not here. If she were sick he would not have left her.\"\r\n\r\n\"True!\" said Zbyszko.\r\n\r\nThey went to Jurand. The heat in the room was intense, as in a bath. It\r\nwas light, because there were big pine logs in the fireplace. Father\r\nWyszoniek kept watch over the patient, who lay in bed, covered with a\r\nbear-skin; his face was pale, his hair matted with perspiration, and his\r\neyes closed. His mouth was open, and his chest laboring with difficulty,\r\nbut with such force that his breathing moved the bear-skin covering up\r\nand down.\r\n\r\n\"How is he doing?\" inquired the princess.\r\n\r\n\"I poured a mug of hot wine into his mouth,\" replied the priest, \"and\r\nperspiration ensued.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is he asleep, or not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Probably not, for he labors heavily.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you try to speak to him?\"\r\n\r\n\"We tried, but he did not answer, and I believe that he will not speak\r\nbefore dawn.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will wait till the dawn,\" said the princess.\r\n\r\nThe priest insisted that she should retire but she paid no attention, for\r\nshe always in everything wished not to fall short of the late Queen\r\nJadwiga, in Christian virtues, in caring for the sick and to redeem with\r\nher merits her father's soul; she therefore did not omit any opportunity\r\nto make the old Christian country appear no worse than others, and by\r\nthis means to obliterate the remembrance that she was born in a heathen\r\nland.\r\n\r\nBesides that, she was burning with desire to hear from Jurand's own lips\r\nabout Danusia, for she was much concerned about her. She therefore sat by\r\nhis bedside and began to tell her beads, and then dozed. Zbyszko who had\r\nnot yet entirely recovered and was moreover greatly fatigued by the night\r\njourney, followed her example; and as the hours passed on, both fell\r\nasleep, so soundly that they might have slept on till daylight, if they\r\nhad not awakened by the ringing of the bell of the castle chapel.\r\n\r\nBut the same sound also awoke Jurand, who opened his eyes and suddenly\r\nsat up in bed and began to stare about him with blinking eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Praised be Jesus Christ!... How do you feel?\" said the princess.\r\n\r\nBut he apparently had not yet regained consciousness, for he looked at\r\nher as though he knew her not, and after awhile he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Hurry! Be quick! Dig open the snowdrift.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the name of God, you are already in Ciechanow!\" again replied the\r\nprincess.\r\n\r\nJurand wrinkled his brow like one who with difficulty tries to collect\r\nhis thoughts, and replied:\r\n\r\n\"In Ciechanow?... The child is waiting ... and ... principality ...\r\nDanuska! Danuska!\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly, he closed his eyes and again fell back on the pillow. Zbyszko\r\nand the princess feared lest he was dead, but at the same moment his\r\nbreast began to heave and he breathed deeply like one who is fast asleep.\r\n\r\nFather Wyszoniek put his finger to his lips and motioned not to awake\r\nhim, then he whispered:\r\n\r\n\"He may sleep thus a whole day.\"\r\n\r\n\"So, but what did he say?\" asked the princess.\r\n\r\n\"He said that the child waits in Ciechanow,\" Zbyszko replied.\r\n\r\n\"Because he does not remember,\" explained the priest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nFather Wyszoniek feared that even at Jurand's next awakening, he might be\r\nstupefied and might not recover consciousness for a long time. Meanwhile\r\nhe promised the princess and Zbyszko to let them know when the old knight\r\ncould speak, and himself retired after they left. In fact Jurand first\r\nawoke on the second Holy Day just before noon, but fully conscious. The\r\nprincess and Zbyszko were present. Therefore, sitting on the bed, he\r\nlooked at and recognized her and said:\r\n\r\n\"Your Highness ... for God's sake, am I in Ciechanow?\"\r\n\r\n\"And you overslept the Holy Day,\" replied the lady.\r\n\r\n\"The snows covered me. Who saved me?\"\r\n\r\n\"This knight: Zbyszko of Bogdaniec. You remember him in Krakow....\"\r\n\r\nAnd Jurand gazed with his sound eye at the youth for a moment and said:\r\n\r\n\"I remember ... but where is Danusia?\"\r\n\r\n\"She did not ride with you?\" anxiously inquired the princess.\r\n\r\n\"How could she ride with me, when I did not go to her?\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko and the princess looked at each other, believing him to be still\r\nspeaking under the influence of the fever. Then the lady said: \"Wake up,\r\nfor God's sake! There was no girl with, you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Girl? With me?\" inquired Jurand in amazement.\r\n\r\n\"Because your people perished, but she could not be found among them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did you leave her in Spychow?\"\r\n\r\nHe then again repeated, but now with alarm in his voice:\r\n\r\n\"In Spychow? Why, she is with you, Your Highness, not with me!\"\r\n\r\n\"However you sent a letter for her to the Forest Court.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the name of the Father and Son!\" replied Jurand. \"I did not send for\r\nher at all.\"\r\n\r\nThen the princess suddenly became pale:\r\n\r\n\"What is that?\" she said, \"are you positive that you are speaking in your\r\nright senses?\"\r\n\r\n\"For God's mercy, where is the child?\" exclaimed Jurand, starting up.\r\n\r\nFather Wyszoniek, on hearing this, quickly left the room, while the\r\nprincess continued:\r\n\r\n\"Listen: There arrived an armed retinue and a letter from you to the\r\nForest Court, for Danusia. The letter stated that you were knocked down\r\nin a conflagration by a falling beam ... that you were half blinded and\r\nthat you wished to see the child.... They took Danusia and rode away....\"\r\n\r\n\"My head swims!\" exclaimed Jurand. \"As there is a God in Heaven, there\r\nwas no fire in Spychow, nor did I send for her!\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment Father Wyszoniek returned with the letter, which he handed\r\nto Jurand and inquired: \"Is not this your clerkly writing?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the seal?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does the letter say?\"\r\n\r\nFather Wyszoniek read the letter while Jurand listened, tearing his hair\r\nand finally saying: \"The writing is counterfeited! ... the seal is\r\nfalse!... my soul! They have captured my child and will destroy her!\"\r\n\r\n\"Who are they?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Teutons!\"\r\n\r\n\"For God's sake! The prince must be informed! He shall send messengers to\r\nthe master!\" exclaimed the princess. \"Merciful Jesus, save her and help!\"\r\n... and she left the room screaming.\r\n\r\nJurand jumped out of bed and began hurriedly to clothe his gigantic\r\nframe. Zbyszko sat as if petrified, but in a few moments his tightly set\r\nteeth began to gnash with rage.\r\n\r\n\"How do you know that the Teutons captured her?\" asked Father Wyszoniek.\r\n\r\n\"By the Passion of our Lord, I'll swear!\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait! ... It may be so. They came to complain about you to the Forest\r\nCourt.\"\r\n\r\n\"They wanted to take revenge on you...\"\r\n\r\n\"And they captured her!\" suddenly exclaimed Zbyszko. Then he hurried out\r\nof the room, and running to the stables he ordered horses to be saddled\r\nand harnessed to wagons, not knowing well himself why he did so. He only\r\nknew that it was necessary to go to Danusia's assistance--at once--and\r\nas far as Prussia--and there to tear her out of the foe's hands or\r\nperish.\r\n\r\nHe then returned to the room to tell Jurand that the weapons and horses\r\nwould soon be ready. He was sure that Jurand would accompany him. His\r\nheart was burning with rage, pain and sorrow,--but at the same time he\r\ndid not lose hope; it seemed to him that he and the formidable knight of\r\nSpychow together would be able to accomplish everything--and that they\r\nwere equal to attacking the whole Teutonic force.\r\n\r\nIn the room, besides Jurand, he met Father Wyszoniek and the princess,\r\nalso the prince and de Lorche, as well as the old knight of Dlugolas,\r\nwhom the prince, having heard of the affair, summoned also to council on\r\naccount of his wisdom and extensive knowledge of the Teutons, who had\r\nkept him for a number of years in slavery.\r\n\r\n\"It is necessary to set about it prudently, so as not to commit a sin in\r\nblind fury and so lose the girl,\" said the knight of Dlugolas.\r\n\r\n\"A complaint must be instantly filed with the master and I will ride\r\nthither, if His Highness will give me a letter to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will give the letter, and go with it,\" said the prince. \"We will not\r\nallow the child to be lost, so help me God and Holy Cross! The master\r\ndreads war with the Polish king, and he is anxious to win over Semka, my\r\nbrother and myself.... They did not capture her at his command--and he\r\nwill order her return.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if it was by his orders?\" inquired Father Wyszoniek.\r\n\r\n\"Although he is a Teuton, there is more honesty in him than in the\r\nothers,\" replied the prince; \"and, as I told you, he would rather\r\naccommodate me than make me angry now. The Jagiellonian power is no\r\nlaughter. Hej! They poured hog's grease under our skin as long as they\r\ncould, but they did not perceive that if also we Mazurs should assist\r\nJagiello, then it would be bad....\"\r\n\r\nBut the knight of Dlugolas said, \"That is true. The Teutons do nothing\r\nfoolishly; therefore, I think that if they have captured the girl, it is\r\neither to disarm Jurand, or to demand a ransom, or to exchange her.\" Here\r\nhe turned to the knight of Spychow:\r\n\r\n\"Whom have you now among your prisoners of war?\"\r\n\r\n\"Herr von Bergow,\" replied Jurand.\r\n\r\n\"Is he important?\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems so.\"\r\n\r\nDe Lorche, hearing the name von Bergow, began to inquire about him, and,\r\nhaving found out, said: \"He is a relative of the Duke of Geldryi, a great\r\nbenefactor of the Order, and devoted to the Order from his birth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the knight of Dlugolas, translating his words to those\r\npresent. \"Von Bergow held high rank in the Order.\"\r\n\r\n\"Danveld and von Löve strongly demanded him,\" remarked the prince.\r\n\r\n\"Whenever they opened their mouths, they said that von Bergow must be\r\nfree. As God is in Heaven they undoubtedly captured the girl, in order to\r\nliberate von Bergow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hence they will return her,\" said the prince.\r\n\r\n\"But it would be better to know where she is,\" replied the knight of\r\nDlugolas. \"But suppose the master asks: 'Whom shall I order to return\r\nher?' what shall we say then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is she?\" said Jurand, in a hollow voice. \"They certainly are not\r\nkeeping her on the border, for fear that I might recover her, but they\r\nhave taken her somewhere to a far secret hold or to the sea.\"\r\n\r\nBut Zbyszko said: \"I will find and recover her.\"\r\n\r\nThe prince now suddenly burst out with suppressed anger: \"Villains\r\ncarried her off from my court, disgracing me as well, and this shall not\r\nbe forgiven as long as I live. I have had enough of their treacheries!\r\nenough of their assaults! I would rather have wolves for neighbors! But\r\nnow the master must punish these lords and return the girl, and send\r\nmessengers with apologies to me, otherwise I will send out a call to\r\narms!\"\r\n\r\nHere he struck the table with his fist and added:\r\n\r\n\"Owa! The lord of Plock will follow me, and Witold and King Jagiello's\r\nforces! Following enough! Even a saint would snort away his patience. I\r\nhave had enough!\"\r\n\r\nAll were silent, waiting until his anger had quieted down; but Anna\r\nDanuta rejoiced that the prince took Danusia's affair so to heart; she\r\nknew that he was long-suffering, but stubborn also, and when he once\r\nundertook anything he never relinquished it until he attained his object.\r\n\r\nThen Father Wyszoniek rose to speak. \"There was of old a rule in the\r\nOrder,\" he said, \"that no lord was permitted to do anything on his own\r\nresponsibility without the permission of the assembly or the master.\r\nTherefore God gave them such extensive territories that they almost\r\nexceed all other earthly powers. But now they know neither obedience,\r\ntruth, honesty, nor belief. Nothing but greed and such ravage as if they\r\nwere wolves and not human beings. How can they obey the master's commands\r\nor those of the assembly, if they do not even obey God's commandments?\r\nEach one resides in his castle like an independent prince--and one\r\nassists another in doing evil. I shall complain to the master--but they\r\nwill deny it. The master will order them to restore the girl, but they\r\nwill refuse to do so, or they will say: 'She is not here, because we have\r\nnot captured her.' He will command them to take oath and they will do so.\r\nWhat shall we do then?\"\r\n\r\n\"What to do?\" rejoined the knight of Dlugolas. \"Let Jurand go to Spychow.\r\nIf they did carry her off for ransom, or to exchange her for von Bergow,\r\nthen they must and will inform no one but Jurand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Those who used to visit the Forest Court captured her,\" said the priest.\r\n\r\n\"Then the master will submit them to trial, or order them to give Jurand\r\nthe field.\"\r\n\r\n\"They must give me the field,\" exclaimed Zbyszko, \"because I challenged\r\nthem first!\"\r\n\r\nAnd Jurand removed his hands from his face and inquired: \"Which of them\r\nwere in the Forest Court?\"\r\n\r\n\"There were Danveld, old von Löve, and two brethren, Godfried and\r\nRotgier,\" replied the priest.\r\n\r\n\"They made complaint and wished the prince to order you to release von\r\nBergow from imprisonment. But the prince, being informed by de Fourcy\r\nthat the Germans were the first to attack you, rebuked and dismissed them\r\nwithout satisfaction.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go to Spychow,\" said the prince, \"because they will apply to you there.\r\nThey failed to do it till now, because this young knight's follower\r\ncrushed Danveld's arm when bearing the challenge to them. Go to Spychow,\r\nand if they apply, inform me. They will send your daughter back in\r\nexchange for von Bergow, but I shall nevertheless take vengeance, because\r\nthey disgraced me also by carrying her off from my court.\"\r\n\r\nHere the prince began to get angry again, for the Teutons had entirely\r\nexhausted his patience, and after a moment he added:\r\n\r\n\"Hej! They blew and blew the fire, but they will end by burning their\r\nmouths.\"\r\n\r\n\"They will deny it,\" repeated the priest Wyszoniek.\r\n\r\n\"If they once inform Jurand that the girl is with them, then they will\r\nnot be able to deny it,\" somewhat impatiently replied Mikolaj of\r\nDlugolas. \"He believes that they are not keeping her on the border, and\r\nthat, as Jurand has justly pointed out, they have carried her to some\r\ndistant castle or to the seashore, but if there be proof that they are\r\nthe perpetrators, then they will not disclaim it before the master.\"\r\n\r\nBut Jurand said in a strange and, at the same time, terrible tone:\r\n\"Danveld, von Löve, Godfried and Rotgier.\"\r\n\r\nMikolaj of Dlugolas also recommended that experienced and shrewd people\r\nbe sent to Prussia, to find out whether Jurand's daughter was there, and\r\nif not, whither she had been taken; then the prince took the staff in his\r\nhand and went out to give the necessary orders; the princess again turned\r\nto Jurand to speak encouraging words:\r\n\r\n\"How are you?\" she inquired.\r\n\r\nHe did not reply for a moment, as if he had not heard the question, but\r\nthen he suddenly said:\r\n\r\n\"As if one had struck me in an old wound.\"\r\n\r\n\"But trust in God's mercy; Danusia will come back as soon as you return\r\nvon Bergow to them. I would willingly sacrifice my own blood.\"\r\n\r\nThe princess hesitated whether to say anything about the marriage now,\r\nbut, considering a little, she did not wish to add new worries to\r\nJurand's already great misfortunes, and at the same time she was seized\r\nwith a certain fear. \"They will look for her with Zbyszko; may he find an\r\noccasion to tell him,\" she said to herself, \"otherwise he may entirely\r\nlose his mind.\" She therefore preferred to discuss other matters.\r\n\r\n\"Do not blame us,\" she said. \"People wearing your livery arrived with a\r\nwriting under your seal, informing us that you were ill, that your eyes\r\nwere closing, and that you wished to look once more upon your child. How\r\ncould we oppose it and not obey a father's command?\"\r\n\r\nBut Jurand embraced her feet. \"I do not blame anybody, gracious lady.\"\r\n\r\n\"And know also that God will return her to you, because His eye is upon\r\nher. He will send her succor, as He did at the last hunt, when a fierce\r\nwild bull attacked us--and Jesus inspired Zbyszko to defend us. He almost\r\nlost his own life, and was ill for a long time afterward, but he saved\r\nDanusia and me, for which he received a girdle and spurs from the prince.\r\nYou see!... God's hand is over her. Surely, the child is to be pitied! I,\r\nmyself, am greatly grieved. I thought she would arrive with you, and that\r\nI should see the dear child, but meanwhile\" ... and her voice trembled,\r\ntears fell from her eyes, and Jurand's long repressed despair burst out\r\nfor a moment, sudden and terrible as a tempest. He took hold of his long\r\nhair, and began to beat his head against the wall, groaning and repeating\r\nin husky tones: \"Jesus! Jesus! Jesus!\"\r\n\r\nBut Zbyszko sprang to his side, and shaking him by the shoulders with all\r\nhis might, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"We must go! To Spychow!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\"Whose retinue is this?\" inquired Jurand, suddenly starting from musing,\r\nas if from sleep, beyond Radzanow.\r\n\r\n\"Mine,\" replied Zbyszko.\r\n\r\n\"And did all my people perish?\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw them dead in Niedzborz.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you no old comrades?\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko made no reply, and they traveled on in silence, but hurriedly,\r\nbecause they wanted to get to Spychow as quickly as possible, hoping\r\npossibly to meet some Teutonic messengers there. To their good fortune\r\nthe frosts set in again, and the highways were firm, so that they could\r\nmake haste.\r\n\r\nToward evening Jurand spoke again, and began to inquire about those\r\nbrethren of the Order who were at the Forest Court, and Zbyszko narrated\r\neverything--their complaints, their departure, the death of de Fourcy,\r\nhis follower's action in crushing Danveld's arm so terribly, and, as he\r\nspoke, one circumstance recurred strikingly to his mind, namely the\r\npresence in the Forest Court of that woman who brought the healing\r\nbalsams from Danveld. During the bait, he commenced therefore to inquire\r\nof the Bohemian and Sanderus about her, but neither knew exactly what had\r\nbecome of her. It seemed to them, that she had left either in company\r\nwith those people, who came for Danusia, or soon after them. It now\r\noccurred to Zbyszko's mind, that this might have been some one sent for\r\nthe purpose of warning the people in case Jurand should happen to be at\r\nthe court in person. In that case they would not claim to have come from\r\nSpychow, but could have prepared another missive to give to the princess\r\ninstead of Jurand's fictitious letter. All this had been arranged with\r\nhellish dexterity, and the young knight, who so far had known the Teutons\r\nonly from the battlefield, thought for the first time, that the fist was\r\nnot sufficient for them, but that they must be overcome with the head as\r\nwell. This was a sullen thought for him, because his great sorrow and\r\npain had become concentrated into a desire for fight and blood. Even help\r\nfor Danusia in his mind took the form of a series of battles either in\r\ntroops or singly; and now he perceived that it might be necessary to\r\nrestrain his desire for revenge and splitting of heads, like a bear on a\r\nchain, and seek new means of saving and recovering Danusia. While\r\nthinking of this, he felt sorry that Macko was not with him. Macko was as\r\ncunning as he was brave. He secretly determined to send Sanderus from\r\nSpychow to Szczytno, in order to find that woman and to try to learn from\r\nher what had happened to Danusia. He said to himself that, even if\r\nSanderus wished to betray him, he could do little harm in the matter, and\r\non the contrary might render great service, because his trade gained\r\nadmittance for him everywhere. However, he wished to consult Jurand\r\nfirst, but postponed it until their arrival in Spychow, the more so\r\nbecause night came on, and it seemed to him, that Jurand, sitting on a\r\nknight's high saddle, had fallen asleep from fatigue, exhaustion and\r\ngreat anxiety. But Jurand rode with a bowed head only because misfortune\r\nweighed it down. And it was apparent that he was constantly thinking of\r\nit, with a heart full of terrible dread, because he finally said:\r\n\r\n\"I would rather be frozen under Niedzborz! It was you that dug me out?\"\r\n\r\n\"I, with others.\"\r\n\r\n\"And at the hunt, you saved my child?\"\r\n\r\n\"What should I have done?\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you help me now, too?\"\r\n\r\nAnd there burst forth in Zbyszko at the same time such love for Danusia\r\nand such great hatred toward the Teuton wrongdoers, that he rose in his\r\nsaddle and began to speak through tightly set teeth, as though with\r\ndifficulty:\r\n\r\n\"Listen to what I say: even if I have to bite the Prussian castles with\r\nmy teeth, I will do it and get her.\"\r\n\r\nThen followed a moment's silence.\r\n\r\nThe vengeful and uncontrollable nature of Jurand also seemed to awake in\r\nfull force under the influence of Zbyszko's words, because he began to\r\ngnash his teeth in the darkness and after a while to repeat again the\r\nnames: Danveld, von Löve, Rotgier and Godfried! And he thought in his\r\nsoul that if they wanted him to restore von Bergow, he would do so; if\r\nthey demanded an additional payment he would give it, even if he had to\r\nthrow into the price Spychow entire; but then, woe to those who had\r\nraised their hands against this his only child!\r\n\r\nThroughout the whole night, sleep did not close their eyelids for a\r\nmoment. At dawn, they scarcely recognized each other, to such an extent\r\nhad their faces changed during this single night. At length Jurand was\r\nstruck by that pain and inveterate hatred on Zbyszko's face and therefore\r\nsaid: \"She saved you and snatched you from death--I know. But you also\r\nlove her?\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko looked directly into his eyes with an almost defiant expression\r\nand replied: \"She is my wife.\"\r\n\r\nUpon that, Jurand stopped his horse and looked at Zbyszko, blinking his\r\neyes with astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"What do you say?\" he inquired.\r\n\r\n\"I say that she is my wife and I am her husband.\"\r\n\r\nThe knight of Spychow brushed his eyes with his sleeve, as if he were\r\ndazed by a sudden thunder-stroke, and after awhile, without a word of\r\nreply, he urged his horse forward to the head of the troop and rode on\r\nsilently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nBut Zbyszko, riding behind him, could not stand it very long, and said to\r\nhimself: \"I would rather have him burst forth in anger, than become\r\nembittered.\" He therefore rode up to him and jogging his stirrup against\r\nhis, he commenced to speak: \"Listen how it happened. You know what\r\nDanusia did for me in Krakow, but you do not know that they proposed to\r\nme Jagienka of Bogdaniec, the daughter of Zych of Zgorzelice. My uncle,\r\nMacko, was in favor of it, also her parents and Zych; a relative, an\r\nabbot, a wealthy man as well.... What is the use of many words?--an\r\nhonest girl and a beautiful woman and the dowry respectable also. But it\r\ncould not be. I felt sorry for Jagienka, but still more so for\r\nDanusia--and I set out to her to Mazowsze, because, I tell you frankly, I\r\ncould not live any longer without her. Recollect the time when you\r\nyourself loved--recollect it! and it will not seem strange to you.\"\r\n\r\nHere Zbyszko broke off, waiting for a word from Jurand, but as the latter\r\nremained silent, he continued:\r\n\r\n\"God gave me an opportunity at the Forest Court to save the princess and\r\nDanusia from a wild bull while hunting. And the princess immediately\r\nsaid: 'Now Jurand will not object any more, because how could he refuse\r\nto reward such a deed?' But I did not wish to take her even then without\r\nyour parental consent. Yet! I was weak,... because the terrible animal\r\ninjured me so much, that it almost killed me. But then, as you know,\r\nthose people came for Danusia, in order to take her, as it seemed, to\r\nSpychow, and I was still unable to leave my bed. I thought I should never\r\nsee her again. I thought that you would take her to Spychow and give her\r\nto some one else. You objected to me at Krakow ... and I already thought\r\nthat I should die. Ah! great God, what a night I passed. Nothing but\r\nworry; nothing but grief! I thought that if she also left me, the sun\r\nwould rise no more. Consider human love and human grief!\"\r\n\r\nAnd, for a moment, tears almost choked Zbyszko's voice, but, having a\r\ncourageous heart, he controlled himself and said:\r\n\r\n\"The people arrived for her in the evening and wanted to take her\r\nimmediately, but the princess ordered them to wait until morning. Just\r\nthen Jesus inspired me with the idea of presenting the princess with my\r\ncompliments and asking her for Danusia. I thought that if I died I should\r\nhave that consolation at least. Remember that the girl had to leave,\r\nwhile I remained ill and nearly dying. There was also no time to ask for\r\nyour permission. The prince was no longer in the Forest Court, the\r\nprincess therefore weighed both sides because she had nobody to take\r\ncounsel with. But they, together with Father Wyszoniek at last took pity\r\nupon me, and Father Wyszoniek performed the ceremony.... God's power,\r\nGod's right!...\"\r\n\r\nBut Jurand interrupted, gloomily: \"And God's punishment!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why should there be punishment?\" inquired Zbyszko. \"Consider only, they\r\nhad sent for her before the ceremony, and whether it had been performed\r\nor not, they would have carried her off nevertheless.\"\r\n\r\nBut Jurand again replied nothing, and rode on alone, gloomy, and with\r\nsuch a stony face, that though Zbyszko at first felt the relief that\r\nconfession of a long concealed thing always produces, at length he was\r\nseized with fear and said to himself, with constantly increasing fear,\r\nthat the old knight was bitterly angered, and that thenceforth they would\r\nbe strangers and foes to each other. And there came upon him a moment of\r\ngreat depression. He had never felt so badly since his departure from\r\nBogdaniec. It seemed to him now that there was no hope of reconciliation\r\nwith Jurand, nor, what was far worse, of saving Danusia, that all was of\r\nno avail, and that in the future still greater misfortunes and miseries\r\nwould befall him. But this depression of spirits lasted a short while\r\nonly, and, in accordance with his nature, it soon changed into anger, and\r\na desire for quarreling and fight. \"He does not want peace,\" he said to\r\nhimself, thinking of Jurand, \"then let there be discord, let come what\r\nwill!\" And he was ready to fly at Jurand's face. He also longed for a\r\nfight with anybody for anything, merely to do something, merely to give\r\nvent to his grief, bitterness and anger, and so find some relief.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile they arrived at an inn at a ford called Swietlik, where Jurand,\r\non his return from the prince's court, usually allowed his people and\r\nhorses to rest. He did so now also involuntarily. After a while he and\r\nZbyszko found themselves alone in a separate chamber. Suddenly Jurand\r\nstopped before the young knight and, fixing his eyes upon him, inquired:\r\n\r\n\"Did you wander about for her sake?\"\r\n\r\nThe other almost harshly retorted:\r\n\r\n\"Do you suppose that I shall deny it?\" And he looked straight into\r\nJurand's eyes, ready to meet anger with anger. But there was no\r\nindignation in the old warrior's face; there was only almost boundless\r\ngrief.\r\n\r\n\"And you saved my child?\" he inquired, after a moment, \"and dug me out?\"\r\n\r\nBut Zbyszko looked at him in astonishment and fear that his mind was\r\nwandering, because Jurand repeated exactly the same questions that he had\r\nalready asked.\r\n\r\n\"Be seated,\" he said, \"because it seems to me that you are still weak.\"\r\n\r\nBut Jurand raised his hands, placed them on Zbyszko's shoulders, and so\r\ndrew him suddenly with all his strength to his breast; the other,\r\nrecovering from a momentary amazement, clasped him round the waist and\r\nthey embraced each other for a long time, because mutual anxiety and\r\nmutual woe united them.\r\n\r\nAfter relaxing their hold, Zbyszko again embraced the older knight's\r\nknees, and began to kiss his hands with tears in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Will you not object to me?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nTo that Jurand replied: \"I did oppose you, because in my soul I\r\nconsecrated her to God.\"\r\n\r\n\"You devoted her to God, and God to me. His will!\"\r\n\r\n\"His will!\" repeated Jurand. \"But now we need mercy also.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whom will God help, if not a father who seeks his daughter; if not a\r\nhusband who seeks his wife? He will certainly not assist robbers.\"\r\n\r\n\"But they captured her nevertheless,\" answered Jurand.\r\n\r\n\"Then you will return von Bergow to them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall return all they wish.\"\r\n\r\nBut at the thought of the Teutons, the old passion soon awoke in him and\r\nenfolded him like a flame, because he added after a moment through his\r\nclenched teeth:\r\n\r\n\"I shall also add to it what they do not want.\"\r\n\r\n\"I also swore their ruin,\" replied Zbyszko, \"but now we must make haste\r\nto Spychow.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he commenced to hasten the saddling of the horses. Accordingly, after\r\nthey had eaten their oats, and the men had warmed themselves in the\r\nrooms, they started out, although it was growing dark outside. As the way\r\nwas long, and a severe frost had set in for the night, Jurand and\r\nZbyszko, who had not yet regained their strength, traveled in sledges.\r\nZbyszko told about Uncle Macko, for whom his heart yearned, and regretted\r\nthat he was not present, because his courage as well as craft might be of\r\nuse, the latter qualification being more necessary against such foes than\r\ncourage. At last he turned to Jurand and inquired:\r\n\r\n\"And are you cunning?... Because I am not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither am I,\" retorted Jurand. \"I did not fight them with craft, but\r\nwith this hand and that which remained in me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand that,\" said the young knight. \"I understand it because I\r\nlove Danusia and because they carried her off. If, God forbid....\"\r\n\r\nAnd he did not finish, because the mere thought made him feel not a human\r\nbut a wolfs heart in his breast. For some time they rode silently over a\r\nwhite, moonlight-flooded road; then Jurand commenced to speak as if to\r\nhimself:\r\n\r\n\"If they only had any reason to take revenge on me--I would not say! But\r\ngracious God! they had none.... I waged war with them in the field, when\r\nsent on an embassy by our prince to Witold, but here I was like a\r\nneighbor to neighbors.... Bartosz Natecz captured, chained and imprisoned\r\nunder ground in Kozmin forty knights who attacked him. The Teutons were\r\ncompelled to pay half a wagonful of money for them. While I, when a\r\nGerman guest happened to come on his way to the Teutons, received and\r\nrewarded him like one knight another. Frequently also, the Teutons came\r\nagainst me across the swamps. I was not hard on them then, and they did\r\nto me what I would not do even to-day to my greatest foe....\"\r\n\r\nAnd terrible recollections began to tear him with increasing force, his\r\nvoice died away for an instant in his breast, then he said, half\r\ngroaning: \"I had only one, like a ewe lamb, like the heart in my breast,\r\nand they captured her like a dog on a rope, and she died there.... Now\r\nagain, the child ... Jesus, Jesus!\"\r\n\r\nAnd again there was silence. Zbyszko raised his youthful, perplexed face\r\ntoward the moon, then again looked at Jurand and inquired:\r\n\r\n\"Father!... It would be far better for them to earn men's esteem than\r\ntheir vengeance. Why do they commit so much wrong on all nations and all\r\npeople?\"\r\n\r\nBut Jurand spread his hands apart as if in despair, and replied with a\r\nchoked voice: \"I do not know....\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko meditated for a time over his own question, presently however his\r\nthoughts turned to Jurand.\r\n\r\n\"People say that you wreaked a worthy vengeance,\" he said.\r\n\r\nJurand meanwhile controlled his anguish, bethought himself and said:\r\n\r\n\"But I swore their ruin ... and I also swore to God that if He would\r\npermit me to glut my vengeance I would surrender to Him the child that\r\nwas left to me. This is the reason why I objected to you. But now I do\r\nnot know: was it His will, or did you awaken His anger by your action?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Zbyszko. \"I told you once before that even if the ceremony had\r\nnot been performed, yet the scoundrels would have carried her off. God\r\naccepted your vow, and presented me with Danusia, because without His\r\nwill we could accomplish nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Every sin is against God's will.\"\r\n\r\n\"A sin is, but not the sacrament. Because the sacrament is God's matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Therefore there is no help.\"\r\n\r\n\"And God be blessed there is not! Therefore do not complain, because\r\nnobody would help you against the robbers so well as I will. You will\r\nsee! In any case I shall pay them for Danusia, but even if one of those\r\nwho captured your deceased be still alive, leave him to me and you shall\r\nsee!\"\r\n\r\nBut Jurand shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he answered, gloomily, \"none of those will be alive....\"\r\n\r\nFor a time only the snorting of horses and the smothered echo of the\r\nhoofs striking against the beaten road was audible.\r\n\r\n\"Once at night,\" continued Jurand, \"I heard a voice, as if coming from a\r\nwall, saying to me: 'Enough vengeance!' but I did not obey, because it\r\nwas not the voice of the deceased.\"\r\n\r\n\"And whose voice could that be?\" inquired Zbyszko, anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know. In Spychow frequently something talks in the walls, and\r\nsometimes moans, because many have died there in chains underground.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what does the priest tell you?\"\r\n\r\n\"The priest sanctified the castle and also ordered me to relinquish\r\nvengeance, but that could not be. I became too hard on them, and then\r\nthey themselves sought revenge. They lay in ambush and challenged me in\r\nthe field.... And so it was this time. Meineger and von Bergow were the\r\nfirst to challenge me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever accept ransom?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never! Of those I have captured, von Bergow will be the first to come\r\nout alive.\"\r\n\r\nThe conversation ceased, because they now turned from the broad highway\r\ninto a narrower road, on which they traveled for a long time in silence\r\non account of its tortuous course, and because in some places the snow\r\nformed drifts difficult to traverse. In the spring or summer, on rainy\r\ndays, this road must have been almost impassable.\r\n\r\n\"Are we approaching Spychow already?\" asked Zbyszko.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered Jurand. \"There is a good deal of forest yet, and then\r\nbegin the morasses, in the centre of which is the castle.... Beyond the\r\nmorasses are the marshes and dry fields, while the castle can be\r\napproached only by the dike. The Germans wished to capture me repeatedly,\r\nbut they could not, and their bones rot among the forest weeds.\"\r\n\r\n\"And it is hard to find,\" said Zbyszko. \"If the Teutons send messengers\r\nwith letters, how will they find us?\"\r\n\r\n\"They have sent out several times already, and they have people who know\r\nthe way.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we could only meet them at Spychow,\" said Zbyszko.\r\n\r\nThis wish was realized sooner than the young knight thought, for issuing\r\nfrom the forest into the open country, where lay Spychow among the\r\nswamps, they perceived before them two riders and a low sledge, in which\r\nwere sitting three dark figures.\r\n\r\nThe night was very bright, therefore the whole group was perfectly\r\nvisible against the white background of snow. Jurand's and Zbyszko's\r\nheart began to beat faster at this sight, because who else would be\r\nriding to Spychow in the middle of the night, but the messengers from the\r\nTeutons?\r\n\r\nZbyszko ordered the driver to go faster, and so they soon came so near\r\neach other, that they could be heard, and two riders, who apparently\r\nwatched over the safety of the sledge, turned to them, and, unslinging\r\ntheir crossbows, cried:\r\n\r\n\"Who is there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Germans!\" whispered Jurand to Zbyszko.\r\n\r\nThen he raised his voice and said:\r\n\r\n\"It is my right to ask, and yours to reply!\"\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Travelers.\"\r\n\r\n\"What sort of travelers?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pilgrims.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where from?\"\r\n\r\n\"From Szczytno.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is they!\" again whispered Jurand.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the sledges had come together, and at the same time six\r\nhorsemen appeared before them. This was the guard of Spychow, which\r\nwatched the dike leading to the castle day and night. With the horses\r\nwere very large and savage dogs, exactly resembling wolves.\r\n\r\nThe guardsmen, having recognized Jurand, began to utter cries of welcome\r\nmingled with astonishment that the master had returned so soon and\r\nunexpectedly; but he was entirely engaged with the messengers, and\r\ntherefore turned to them again:\r\n\r\n\"Where are you traveling to?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"To Spychow.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you want there?\"\r\n\r\n\"We can tell that only to the lord himself.\"\r\n\r\nJurand was about to say: \"I am the lord of Spychow;\" but he restrained\r\nhimself, feeling that conversation could not be carried on in the\r\npresence of others. He asked them instead, whether they had any letters,\r\nand, when they replied that they were ordered to communicate verbally, he\r\ngave orders to drive as fast as the horses could go. Zbyszko was equally\r\nanxious to hear news of Danusia, and could not turn his attention to\r\nanything else. He became impatient when the guards on the dike stopped\r\nthem twice; and when the bridge was lowered over the moat, behind which\r\nrose on the mound a gigantic palisade, and although he had previously\r\noften desired to see that castle of ominous fame, at the mention of which\r\nthe Germans made the sign of a cross, now he saw nothing but the Teuton\r\nmessengers, from whom he might hear where Danusia was and when she would\r\nbe set at liberty. He did not foresee though, that a great disappointment\r\nwas awaiting him. Besides the horsemen, who were given for defence, and\r\nthe driver, the embassy from Szczytno was composed of two persons: one of\r\nthese was the same woman who had once brought the healing balsam to the\r\nForest Court; the other was a young _pontnik_.[108] Zbyszko did not\r\nrecognize the woman, because he had not seen her at the Forest Court; the\r\n_pontnik_ at once seemed to him to be a disguised warrior. Jurand soon\r\nled both into the neighboring room, and halted before them, huge, and\r\nalmost terrible in the glow of the fire, which fell upon him from the\r\nlogs burning in the chimney.\r\n\r\n\"Where is the child?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nBut they were frightened, standing face to face with a menacing man.\r\nAlthough the _pontnik_ had an insolent face, he simply trembled like a\r\nleaf, and the woman's legs trembled also. She glanced from Jurand to\r\nZbyszko, and then at the shining bald head of the priest Kaleb, and then\r\nagain at Jurand, as if inquiring what the other two were doing there.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" she said, finally, \"we do not know what you are asking, but we\r\nwere sent to you on important matters. Yet, the one who sent us ordered\r\nus explicitly, that the conversation should be held without witnesses.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no secrets from these!\" said Jurand.\r\n\r\n\"But we have, noble lord,\" replied the woman, \"and if you order them to\r\nremain, then we shall ask for nothing but that you allow us to leave\r\nto-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nAnger appeared in Jurand's face as he was not used to opposition. For a\r\nmoment his tawny moustache worked ominously, but he reflected, \"For\r\nDanusia's sake!\" and restrained himself. Moreover, Zbyszko, who wanted\r\nabove all things that the conversation might be concluded as soon as\r\npossible, and felt sure that Jurand would repeat it to him, said:\r\n\r\n\"If it must be so, then remain alone.\" And he left, together with the\r\npriest Kaleb; but he scarcely found himself in the main hall, in which\r\nwere hanging targets and weapons, captured by Jurand, when Glowacz\r\napproached him.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" he said, \"that is the same woman!\"\r\n\r\n\"What woman?\"\r\n\r\n\"From the Teutons, who brought the balsam. I recognized her at once, and\r\nso did Sanderus. She came, at it seems, to spy, and she certainly knows\r\nnow where the lady is.\"\r\n\r\n\"And we shall know,\" said Zbyszko.\r\n\r\n\"Do you also know that _pontnik_?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Sanderus; \"but do not buy, sir, any remissions from him,\r\nbecause he is a false _pontnik_,\"\r\n\r\n\"If you put him to the torture, you might obtain a lot of information.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait!\" said Zbyszko.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in the next room hardly had the doors closed behind Zbyszko\r\nand the priest Kaleb, when the sister of the Order quickly approached\r\nJurand and whispered:\r\n\r\n\"Robbers captured your daughter.\"\r\n\r\n\"With crosses on their robes?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. But God blessed the pious brethren, so that they recovered her, and\r\nnow she is with them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is she, I ask.\"\r\n\r\n\"Under the care of the religious Brother Shomberg,\" she answered,\r\ncrossing her hands on her breast and bowing humbly.\r\n\r\nBut Jurand, hearing the dreadful name of the hangman of Witold's\r\nchildren, turned as pale as linen; after a moment he sat on a bench, shut\r\nhis eyes, and began to wipe away the cold perspiration, which collected\r\nin beads on his forehead.\r\n\r\nSeeing this, the _pontnik_, although he had not hitherto been able to\r\nrestrain his fear, now put his hands on his hips, lounged on the bench,\r\nstretched out his legs and looked at Jurand, with eyes full of pride and\r\nscorn. A long silence followed.\r\n\r\n\"Brother Markward also assists Brother Shomberg in guarding her,\" again\r\nsaid the woman; \"it is a vigilant watch and no harm will happen to the\r\nlady.\"\r\n\r\n\"What am I to do in order to get her back?\" inquired Jurand.\r\n\r\n\"To humble yourself before the Order!\" proudly said the _pontnik_.\r\n\r\nAt this Jurand arose, went up to him, and bending down over him, said in\r\nconcentrated, terrible tones:\r\n\r\n\"Be silent!\"\r\n\r\nAnd the _pontnik_ was again terror-stricken. He knew, that he could\r\nthreaten and say what would tame and overwhelm Jurand, but he was\r\nterrified lest, before saying a word, something dreadful would happen to\r\nhim; he therefore remained silent, with dilated eyes, as if petrified\r\nwith fear, fixed on the threatening face of the lord of Spychow, and sat\r\nmotionless, only his beard began to quiver with agitation.\r\n\r\nJurand again turned to the sister of the Order:\r\n\r\n\"Have you a letter?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir. We have no letter. What we have to say, we were ordered to say\r\nverbally.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then speak!\"\r\n\r\nAnd she repeated again, as if wishing that Jurand should impress it well\r\nin his memory:\r\n\r\n\"Brother Shomberg and Brother Markward watch over the lady; therefore,\r\nyou sir, restrain your anger.... But no evil will happen to her, because\r\nalthough you have gravely injured the Order for many years, nevertheless\r\nthe brethren wish to repay you good for evil if you comply with their\r\njust demands.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do they wish?\"\r\n\r\n\"They wish you to release Herr von Bergow.\"\r\n\r\nJurand breathed heavily.\r\n\r\n\"I will return von Bergow to them,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"And the other prisoners that you have in Spychow.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are two retainers of Meineger and von Bergow, besides their boys.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must release them, sir, and make amends for the imprisonment.\"\r\n\r\n\"God forbid that I should bargain for my child.\"\r\n\r\n\"The religious friars expected that from you,\" said the woman, \"but this\r\nis not all that I was ordered to say. Your daughter, sir, was captured by\r\nsome men, undoubtedly robbers, and certainly for the purpose of demanding\r\na rich ransom. God permitted the brethren to recapture her, and now they\r\ndemand nothing but the return of their brother and associate. But the\r\nbrethren know, and you, too, sir, what hatred there is in this country\r\nagainst them, and how unfairly even their most righteous actions are\r\njudged. For this reason the brethren are sure that, if the people here\r\nfound out that your daughter was with them, they would at once begin to\r\nsuspect that they had captured her, and would consequently utter only\r\nslander and complaints.... O yes, evil and malicious people here have\r\nfrequently repaid them so, and the reputation of the holy Order has\r\nsuffered greatly by it, and the brethren are greatly concerned about it,\r\nand therefore they add this sole condition that you alone assure the\r\nprince of this country and all the mighty knights that it is true, that\r\nnot the Teutonic knights, but robbers carried off your daughter, and that\r\nyou had to ransom her from robbers.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is true,\" said Jurand, \"that bandits have captured my child, and that\r\nI have to buy her back from bandits....\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall tell nobody otherwise, because if only one person should find\r\nout that you come to terms with the brethren, if only one living soul or\r\nonly one complaint were sent to the master, or the assembly, great\r\ncomplications would ensue.\"\r\n\r\nJurand's face exhibited great alarm. At the first moment it seemed to him\r\nquite natural that the knights required secrecy, fearing responsibility\r\nand disgrace, but now a suspicion arose in his mind that there might be\r\nanother reason, but, not being able to account for it, he was seized with\r\nsuch terror as sometimes happens to the most courageous when danger does\r\nnot threaten them alone, but also their relatives and loved ones.\r\n\r\nHe determined however to find out more from the Order's servant.\r\n\r\n\"The knights wish secrecy,\" he said, \"but how can it be kept, when I\r\nrelease von Bergow and the others in return for my child?\"\r\n\r\n\"You will say that you accepted ransom for von Bergow in order to be able\r\nto pay the robbers.\"\r\n\r\n\"People will not believe it, because I never accepted ransom,\" gloomily\r\nreplied Jurand.\r\n\r\n\"But your child was never in question,\" hissed the messenger in reply.\r\n\r\nAnd again silence followed, after which the _pontnik_, who, in the\r\nmeanwhile had gained courage, and judged that Jurand must now restrain\r\nhimself more, said:\r\n\r\n\"Such is the will of the brethren Shomberg and Markward.\"\r\n\r\nThe messenger continued:\r\n\r\n\"You will say, that this _pontnik_ who came with me, brought you the\r\nransom, we also will leave here with the noble von Bergow and the\r\nprisoners.\"\r\n\r\n\"How so?\" said Jurand, frowning, \"do you think that I will give up the\r\nprisoners before you return my child?\"\r\n\r\n\"You can act, sir, still differently. You can call personally for your\r\ndaughter at Szczytno, whither the brethren will bring her to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I? at Szczytno?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because, should the bandits capture her again on the way, your and your\r\npeople's suspicion would again fall upon the pious knights, and therefore\r\nthey prefer to give her into your own hands.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who will pledge himself for my return, if I walk alone into a wolf's\r\nthroat?\"\r\n\r\n\"The virtue of the brethren, their justice and godliness!\"\r\n\r\nJurand began to walk up and down the room. He began to suspect treason\r\nand feared it, but he felt at the same time that the Teutons could impose\r\nany conditions they pleased upon him, and that he was powerless before\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nHowever, an idea struck him, and suddenly halting before the _pontnik_,\r\nhe gazed at him with a piercing look, and then turned to the messenger\r\nand said;\r\n\r\n\"Well, I will go to Szczytno. You and this man, who is wearing _pontnik_\r\ngarb, will remain here until my return, after which you will leave with\r\nvon Bergow and the prisoners.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you refuse, sir, to believe friars.\" said the _pontnik_; \"how then\r\ncan they trust you to liberate us and von Bergow on your return?\"\r\n\r\nJurand's face turned pale with fury, and a critical moment followed, in\r\nwhich it almost seemed that he would catch the _pontnik_ by the throat\r\nand dash him to the floor; but he suppressed his anger, drew a deep\r\nbreath and commenced to speak slowly but emphatically.\r\n\r\n\"Whoever you are, do not strain my patience to the breaking point!\"\r\n\r\nBut the _pontnik_ turned to the sister: \"Speak! what you were ordered.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lord,\" she said: \"we would not dare distrust your oath upon your sword\r\nand knightly honor, but it is not proper for you to swear before people\r\nof low rank. And we were not sent for your oath.\"\r\n\r\n\"What were you sent for?\"\r\n\r\n\"The brethren told us that, without saying anything to anybody, you must\r\nappear at Szczytno with von Bergow and the prisoners.\"\r\n\r\nAt that, Jurand's shoulders began to draw together, and his fingers to\r\nextend like the claws of a bird of prey; at last, stopping before the\r\nwoman, he bent down, as if to speak into her ear, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Did they not tell you that I should order you and von Bergow to be\r\nbroken on the wheel in Spychow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your daughter is in the power of the brethren, and under the care of\r\nShomberg and Markward,\" replied the sister, meaningly.\r\n\r\n\"Robbers, poisoners, hangmen!\" burst forth Jurand.\r\n\r\n\"Who are able to avenge us and who said at our departure: 'Should he not\r\ncomply with all our orders, it would be far better that the girl should\r\ndie, as Witold's children died.' Choose!\"\r\n\r\n\"And understand that you are in the power of the knights,\" remarked the\r\n_pontnik_. \"They do not wish to do you any harm, and the _starosta_ of\r\nSzczytno sends you his word by us that you shall go free from his castle;\r\nbut they want you, for the wrong done to them, to present your respects\r\nto the Teuton, and beg for the victor's mercy. They want to forgive you,\r\nbut they first wish to bend your stubborn neck. You denounced them as\r\ntraitors and perjurers.--therefore they want you to acknowledge their\r\ngood faith. They will restore you and your daughter to liberty--but you\r\nmust beg for it. You trampled upon them--now you must swear that your\r\nhand will never, be raised against the white robe.\"\r\n\r\n\"The knights wish it so,\" added the woman, \"and Markward and Shomberg\r\nwith them.\"\r\n\r\nA moment of deathlike silence followed. It seemed only that somewhere\r\namong the beams of the ceiling some smothered echo repeated as if in\r\nterror: \"Markward ... Shomberg.\"\r\n\r\nOutside the windows could be heard the voices of Jurand's archers keeping\r\nwatch on the mounds near the palisade of the castle.\r\n\r\nThe _pontnik_ and the servant of the Order looked for a long time at each\r\nother and Jurand, who sat leaning against the wall, motionless, and with\r\na face deeply shadowed by furs suspended by the window. His brain\r\ncontained only one thought, that, if he did not do what the Teutons\r\ndemanded, they would destroy his child; again, if he should do it, he\r\nmight perhaps even then not save Danusia nor himself. And he saw no help,\r\nno way of escape. He felt a pitiless superior force over him which was\r\ncrushing him. He saw in his soul already the iron hands of a Teuton on\r\nDanusia's throat; knowing them thoroughly, he did not doubt for a moment\r\nthat they would kill her, bury her in the castle yard, and then deny\r\nit,--and who would then be able to prove that they had captured her?\r\n\r\nIt was true that Jurand had the messengers in his power; he could bring\r\nthem to the prince and get a confession by means of torture, but the\r\nTeutons had Danusia, and they might not care about their agents' torture.\r\nAnd for a moment he seemed to see his child stretching out her hands from\r\nafar, asking for assistance.... If he at least knew that she was really\r\nat Szczytno, then he could go that very night to the border, attack the\r\nunsuspecting Germans, capture the castle, destroy the garrison and\r\nliberate the child--but she might not be and positively was not in\r\nSzczytno. It flashed like lightning through his head, that if he were to\r\nseize the woman and the _pontnik_, and take them directly to the grand\r\nmaster, then perhaps the master could draw confessions from them and\r\nmight order the return of his daughter; but that gleam was extinguished\r\nalmost as quickly as it took fire.\r\n\r\nThese people could tell the master that they came to ransom von Bergow\r\nand that they knew nothing about a girl. No! that way led to nothing, but\r\nwhat did? He thought, that should he go to Szczytno they would chain him\r\nand cast him under ground, while Danusia would not be released, lest it\r\nshould transpire that they had captured her, if for no other reason. And\r\nmeanwhile death hung over his only child, death over the last dear\r\nhead!... And finally his thoughts grew confused, and the pain became so\r\ngreat, that it overpowered itself and became numbness. He sat motionless,\r\nfor his body became as dead as if cut out of stone. If he wanted to rise\r\nnow, he would not be able to do so.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the others grew tired of the long waiting, therefore the\r\nservant of the Order arose and said:\r\n\r\n\"It will be soon daylight, therefore permit us, sir, to retire, because\r\nwe need a rest.\"\r\n\r\n\"And refreshment after the long journey,\" added the _pontnik_. Then they\r\nboth bowed to Jurand and went out.\r\n\r\nBut he continued to sit motionless, as if seized by sleep or death.\r\n\r\nPresently, however, the door opened and Zbyszko appeared, followed by the\r\npriest Kaleb.\r\n\r\n\"Who are the messengers? What do they want?\" inquired the young knight,\r\napproaching Jurand.\r\n\r\nJurand quivered, but at first answered nothing; he only began to blink\r\nlike a man awakened from a sound sleep.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, are you not ill?\" said the priest Kaleb, who, knowing Jurand\r\nbetter, noticed that something curious was taking place within him.\r\n\r\n\"No!\" replied Jurand.\r\n\r\n\"And Danusia?\" further inquired Zbyszko; \"where is she and what did they\r\nsay to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"What did they bring?\"\r\n\r\n\"The ransom,\" slowly replied Jurand.\r\n\r\n\"The ransom for von Bergow?\"\r\n\r\n\"For von Bergow....\"\r\n\r\n\"How so, for von Bergow? what is the matter with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing.\"\r\n\r\nBut in his voice there was something so strange and listless that a\r\nsudden fear seized those two, especially because Jurand spoke of the\r\nransom and not the exchange of von Bergow for Danusia.\r\n\r\n\"Gracious God!\" exclaimed Zbyszko: \"where is Danusia?\"\r\n\r\n\"She is not with the Teutons,--no!\" replied Jurand, in a sleepy tone; and\r\nsuddenly he fell from the bench upon the floor as if dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nThe following day at noon the messengers saw Jurand, and soon afterward\r\nthey rode away taking with them von Bergow, two esquires and a number of\r\nother prisoners. Jurand then summoned Father Kaleb and dictated a letter\r\nto the prince, stating that Danusia had not been carried off by the\r\nKnights of the Order, but that he had succeeded in discovering her\r\nrefuge, and hoped to recover her in a few days. He repeated the same to\r\nZbyszko, who had been wild with astonishment, dread and perplexity since\r\nthe night before.\r\n\r\nThe old knight refused to answer any of his questions, telling him\r\ninstead to wait patiently and not to undertake anything for the\r\nliberation of Danusia, because it was unnecessary.\r\n\r\nToward evening he shut himself in again with Father Kaleb, whom he had\r\nordered to write down his last will; then he confessed himself, and after\r\nreceiving the sacrament, he summoned Zbyszko, and the old taciturn\r\nTolima, who used to accompany him in all his expeditions and fights, and\r\nin times of peace administered the affairs of Spychow.\r\n\r\n\"Here,\" he said, turning to the old warrior and raising his voice, as if\r\nhe was speaking to a man who could not hear well, \"is the husband of my\r\ndaughter whom he married at the prince's court, for which he had my\r\nentire consent. Therefore, after my death, he will be the master and\r\nowner of the castle, the soil, forests, waters, people and all the craft\r\nin Spychow....\"\r\n\r\nHearing this, Tolima was greatly surprised and began to turn his square\r\nhead to Jurand and to Zbyszko alternately, he said nothing, however,\r\nbecause he scarcely ever did say anything, he only bowed to Zbyszko and\r\nlightly embraced his knees. And Jurand continued:\r\n\r\n\"This is my will, written by Father Kaleb, and below is my seal in wax;\r\nyou must testify that you have heard this from me, and that I ordered\r\nthat the young knight should be obeyed here even as I am. Furthermore,\r\nwhat is in the treasury in booty and money, you will show him, and you\r\nwill serve him faithfully in peace as well as in war till death. Did you\r\nhear?\"\r\n\r\nTolima raised his hands to his ears and nodded his head, then, at a sign\r\nfrom Jurand, he bowed and went out; the knight again turned to Zbyszko\r\nand said impressively:\r\n\r\n\"There is enough in the treasury to satisfy the greatest greed and to\r\nransom not one but a hundred captives. Remember!\"\r\n\r\nBut Zbyszko inquired:\r\n\r\n\"And why are you giving me Spychow already?\"\r\n\r\n\"I give you more than Spychow, in the child.\"\r\n\r\n\"And we know not the hour of death,\" said Father Kaleb.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, unknown,\" repeated Jurand, sadly, \"a short time ago, the snow\r\ncovered me up, and, although God saved me, I have no more my old\r\nstrength....\"\r\n\r\n\"Gracious God!\" exclaimed Zbyszko, \"something his changed within you\r\nsince yesterday, and you prefer to speak of death than of Danusia.\r\nGracious God!\"\r\n\r\n\"Danusia will return, she will,\" replied Jurand; \"she is under God's\r\nprotection. But if she returns ... listen ... take her to Bogdaniec and\r\nleave Spychow with Tolima.... He is a faithful man, and this is a wild\r\nneighborhood.... There they cannot capture her with a rope ... there she\r\nis safer....\"\r\n\r\n\"Hej!\" cried Zbyszko, \"and you talk already as if from the other world.\r\nWhat is that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I went half-way to the other world, and now I seem to be ill.\r\nAnd I also care for my child ... because I have only her. And, you too,\r\nalthough I know that you love her....\"\r\n\r\nHere he interrupted, and drawing a short weapon from its sheath, called\r\nthe _misericordia_, he held the handle toward Zbyszko.\r\n\r\n\"Swear to me now upon this little cross that you will never harm her and\r\nthat you will love her constantly....\"\r\n\r\nAnd tears suddenly started in Zbyszko's eyes; in a moment he fell upon\r\nhis knees and, putting a finger on the hilt, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Upon the Holy Passion, I will never harm, and will love her constantly!\"\r\n\r\n\"Amen,\" said Father Kaleb.\r\n\r\nJurand again put the \"dagger of mercy\" back into the sheath and extended\r\nhis arms:\r\n\r\n\"Then you are my child too!...\"\r\n\r\nThey separated then, because it was late, and they had had no good rest\r\nfor several days. However, Zbyszko got up the following morning at\r\ndaybreak, because the previous day he had been frightened, lest Jurand\r\nwere really falling ill, and he wished to learn how the older knight had\r\nspent the night. Before the door to Jurand's room he met Tolima, who had\r\njust left it.\r\n\r\n\"How is the lord? well?\" he inquired.\r\n\r\nThe other again bowed, and then, putting his hand to his ear, said:\r\n\r\n\"What orders, your grace?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am asking how the lord is?\" repeated Zbyszko, louder.\r\n\r\n\"The lord has departed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where to?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know.... In arms!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nThe dawn was just beginning to whiten the trees, bushes and boulders\r\nscattered in the fields, when the hired guide, walking beside Jurand's\r\nhorse, stopped and said:\r\n\r\n\"Permit me to rest, knight, for I am out of breath. It is thawing and\r\nfoggy, but it is not far now.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will conduct me to the road, and then return,\" replied Jurand.\r\n\r\n\"The road will be to the right behind the forest, and you will soon see\r\nthe castle from the hill.\"\r\n\r\nThen the peasant commenced to strike his hands against his armpits,\r\nbecause he was chilled with the morning dampness; he then sat on a stone,\r\nbecause this exercise made him still more breathless.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know whether the count is in the castle?\" inquired Jurand.\r\n\r\n\"Where else could he be, since he is ill?\"\r\n\r\n\"What ails him?\"\r\n\r\n\"People say that the Polish knights gave him a beating,\" replied the old\r\npeasant. And there was a feeling of satisfaction in his voice. He was a\r\nTeuton subject, but his Mazovian heart rejoiced over the superiority of\r\nthe Polish knights.\r\n\r\nHe presently added:\r\n\r\n\"Hej! our lords are strong, but they have a hard task with them.\"\r\n\r\nBut immediately after saying this, he looked sharply at the knight, as if\r\nto convince himself that nothing bad would happen to him for the words\r\nwhich he had heedlessly let slip and said:\r\n\r\n\"You, lord, speak our language; you are no German?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Jurand; \"but lead on.\"\r\n\r\nThe peasant arose, and again began to walk beside the horse. On the way,\r\nhe now and then put his hand into a leathern pouch, pulled out a handful\r\nof unground corn, and put it into his mouth, and when he had thus\r\nsatisfied his first hunger, he began to explain why he ate raw grains,\r\nalthough Jurand was too much occupied with his own misfortune and his own\r\nthoughts, to heed him.\r\n\r\n\"God be blessed for that,\" he said. \"A hard life under our German lords!\r\nThey lay such taxes upon grist, that a poor man must eat the grain with\r\nthe chaff, like an ox. And when they find a hand-mill in a cottage, they\r\nexecute the peasant, take whatever he has, bah! they do not pardon even\r\nwomen and children.... They fear neither God nor the priests. They even\r\nput the priest in chains for blaming them for it. Oh, it is hard under\r\nthe Germans! If a man does grind some grains between two stones, then he\r\nkeeps that handful of flour for the holy Sunday, and must eat like birds\r\non Friday. But God be blessed for even that, because two or three months\r\nbefore the harvest there will not be even that much. It is not permitted\r\nto catch fish ... nor kill animals ... It is not as it is in Mazowsze.\"\r\n\r\nThe Teutonic peasant complained, speaking partly to himself, and partly\r\nto Jurand, and meanwhile they passed through a waste country, covered\r\nwith limestone boulders, heaped with snow, and entered a forest, which\r\nlooked grey in the morning light, and from which came a sharp, damp\r\ncoolness. It became broad daylight; otherwise it would have been\r\ndifficult for Jurand to travel along the forest road, which ran somewhat\r\nup hill, and was so narrow that his gigantic battle-horse could, in some\r\nplaces, hardly pass between the trunks. But the forest soon ended, and in\r\na few \"_Paters_,\" they reached the summit of a white hill, across the\r\nmiddle of which ran a beaten road.\r\n\r\n\"This is the road, lord,\" said the peasant; \"you will find the way alone,\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall,\" replied Jurand. \"Return home, man.\" And putting his hand into\r\na leather bag, fastened in front of the saddle, he took from it a silver\r\ncoin and handed it to the guide. The peasant, accustomed more to blows\r\nthan to gifts from the local Teutonic knights, could scarcely believe his\r\neyes, and catching the money, dropped his head to Jurand's stirrup and\r\nembraced it.\r\n\r\n\"O Jesus, Mary!\" he exclaimed: \"God reward your honor!\"\r\n\r\n\"God be with you!\"\r\n\r\n\"God's grace be with you! Szczytno is before you.\"\r\n\r\nThen he once more bent down to the stirrup and disappeared. Jurand\r\nremained on the hill alone and looked in the direction indicated by the\r\npeasant, at a grey, moist veil of fog, which concealed the world before\r\nhim. Behind this fog was hidden that ominous castle, to which he was\r\ndriven by superior force and misery. It is already near, then, and what\r\nmust happen, must happen.... As that thought came into Jurand's heart, in\r\naddition to his fear and anxiety about Danusia, and his readiness to\r\nredeem her from a foe's hands even with his own blood, he experienced a\r\nnew, exceedingly bitter, and hitherto unknown feeling of humiliation. And\r\nnow Jurand, at the mere mention of whose name the neighboring counts\r\ntrembled, was riding to their command with a bowed head. He who had\r\ndefeated and trampled under foot so many of them, now felt himself\r\ndefeated and trampled upon. It is true, they had not overcome him in the\r\nfield with courage and knightly strength, nevertheless he felt himself\r\nsubdued. And it was to him something so unusual, that it seemed as if the\r\nentire order of the world were subverted. He was going to submit himself\r\nto the Teutons, he, who would rather meet single-handed the entire Teuton\r\nforce, if it were not for Danusia's sake. Had it not happened already,\r\nthat a single knight, having to choose between disgrace and death had\r\nattacked whole armies? But he felt that he might meet disgrace, and, at\r\nthat thought, his heart groaned with agony as a wolf howls when it feels\r\nthe dart within it.\r\n\r\nBut he was a man with not only a body, but also a soul, of iron. He knew\r\nhow to subdue others, he knew also how to subdue himself.\r\n\r\n\"I will not move,\" he said to himself, \"until I have overcome this anger\r\nwith which I should rather lose than deliver my child.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he wrestled with his hard heart, his inveterate hatred and his desire\r\nto fight. Whoever had seen him on that hill, in armor, on a gigantic\r\nhorse, would have said that he was some giant, wrought out of iron, and\r\nwould not have recognized that that motionless knight at that moment was\r\nwaging the hottest of all the battles of his life. But he fought with\r\nhimself until he had entirely overcome and felt that his will would not\r\nfail him. Meanwhile the mist thinned, although it did not disappear\r\nentirely, but finally something darker loomed through it.\r\n\r\nJurand guessed that these were the walls of the castle of Szczytno. At\r\nthe sight of it he still did not move from the place, but began to pray\r\nso fervidly and ardently as a man prays, when nothing is left for him in\r\nthe world but God's mercy. And when his horse did finally move, he felt\r\nthat some sort of confidence was beginning to enter his heart. He was now\r\nprepared to suffer everything that could befall him. There came back to\r\nhis memory Saint George, a descendant of the greatest race in Cappadocia,\r\nwho suffered various shameful tortures, and nevertheless not only did not\r\nlose any honor, but is placed on the right hand of God and appointed\r\npatron of all knighthood. Jurand had sometimes heard tales of his\r\nexploits from the abbots, who came from distant countries, and now he\r\nstrengthened his heart with these recollections.\r\n\r\nSlowly even, hope began to awaken in him. The Teutons were indeed famous\r\nfor their desire of revenge, therefore he did not doubt that they would\r\ntake vengeance on him for all the defeats which he had inflicted upon\r\nthem, for the disgrace which had fallen upon them after each encounter,\r\nand for the dread in which they had lived for so many years.\r\n\r\nBut that very consideration increased his courage. He thought that they\r\nhad captured Danusia only in order to get him; therefore of what use\r\nwould she be to them, after they had gotten him? Yes! They would\r\nundoubtedly seize him, and, not daring to keep him near Mazowsze, they\r\nwould send him to some distant castle, where perhaps he would have to\r\ngroan until his life's end under ground, but they would liberate Danusia.\r\nEven if it should prove that they had got him insidiously and by\r\noppression, neither the grand master nor the assembly would blame them\r\nvery much for that, because Jurand was actually very hard on the Teutons,\r\nand shed more of their blood than did any other knight in the world. But\r\nthat same grand master would perhaps punish them for the imprisonment of\r\nthe innocent girl, who was moreover a foster-daughter of the prince,\r\nwhose favor he was seeking on account of the threatening war with the\r\nPolish king.\r\n\r\nAnd his hope constantly increased. At times it seemed to him almost\r\ncertain that Danusia would return to Spychow, under Zbyszko's powerful\r\nprotection.... \"He is a strong man,\" he thought; \"he will not permit\r\nanybody to injure her.\" And he began to recall with affection all he knew\r\nof Zbyszko: \"He defeated the Germans at Wilno, fought single-handed\r\nagainst the Fryzjans whom he challenged with his uncle and quartered, he\r\nalso beat Lichtenstein, saved the child from the wild bull, and he\r\nchallenged those four, whom he will surely not pardon.\" Here Jurand\r\nraised his eyes toward heaven and said: \"I gave her to you, O Lord, and\r\nyou to Zbyszko!\"\r\n\r\nAnd he gained still more confidence, judging that if God had given her to\r\nthe youth, then He would certainly not allow the Germans to mock him but\r\nsnatch her out of their hands, even if the entire Teuton power should\r\noppose it. But then he commenced to think again about Zbyszko: \"Bah! he\r\nis not only a mighty man but also as true as gold. He will guard her,\r\nlove her, and Jesus! be good to her; but it seems to me, that, by his\r\nside she will neither miss the princely court nor paternal love....\" At\r\nthat thought his eyelids became suddenly moist, and a great yearning\r\nfilled us heart. He would like to see his child once more at least in his\r\nlife, and at some future time die in Spychow near those two, and not in\r\nthe dark Teuton cells. \"But God's will be done!\" Szczytno was already\r\nvisible. The walls became more distinct in the mist, the hour of\r\nsacrifice was approaching; he therefore began to comfort himself, and\r\nsaid to himself: \"Surely, it is God's will! but the end of life is near.\r\nA few years more or less, the result will be the same. Hej! I would like\r\nto see both children yet, but, justly speaking, I have lived long enough.\r\nWhatever I had to experience, I did; whomever to revenge, I revenged. And\r\nwhat now? Rather to God, than to the world; and since it is necessary to\r\nsuffer, then it is necessary. Danusia with Zbyszko, even when most\r\nprosperous, will not forget. Surely, they will sometimes recollect and\r\nask: where is he? is he alive yet, or already in God's court of justice?\r\nThey will inquire and perhaps find out. The Teutons are very revengeful,\r\nbut also very greedy for ransom. Zbyszko would not grudge ransoming the\r\nbones at least. And they will surely order more than one mass. The hearts\r\nof both are honest and loving, for which may God and the Most Holy Mother\r\nbless them!\"\r\n\r\nThe road became not only broader but also more frequented. Wagons laden\r\nwith lumber and straw were on the way to the town. Herders were driving\r\ncattle. Frozen fish were carried on sledges from the lakes. In one place\r\nfour archers led a peasant on a chain to court for some offence, for he\r\nhad his hands tied behind him, and on his feet were fetters which,\r\ndragging in the snow, hardly enabled him to move. From his panting\r\nnostrils and mouth escaped breath in the shape of wreaths of vapor, while\r\nthey sang as they urged him on. Or seeing Jurand, they began to look at\r\nhim inquisitively, apparently marvelling at the huge proportions of the\r\nrider and horse; but, at the sight of the golden spurs and knightly belt,\r\nthey lowered then crossbows as a sign of welcome and respect. The town\r\nwas still more populous and noisy, but everybody hastily got out of the\r\narmed man's way, while he, traversing the main street, turned toward the\r\ncastle which, wrapped in clouds, seemed to sleep yet.\r\n\r\nNot everything around slept, at least not the crows and ravens, whole\r\nflights of which were stirring on the elevation, which constituted the\r\nentrance to the castle, flapping their wings and crowing. On coming\r\nnearer, Jurand understood the cause of their gathering. Beside the road\r\nleading to the gate of the castle, stood wide gallows, on which were\r\nhanging the bodies of four Mazovian peasants. There was not the least\r\nbreath of wind, therefore the corpses, which seemed to be looking at\r\ntheir own feet, did not sway at all, except when the black buds perched\r\nupon their shoulders and heads, jostling one another, striking the ropes\r\nand pecking the bowed heads. Some of the hanged men must have been there\r\nfor a long time, because their skulls were entirely naked, and their legs\r\nvery much lengthened. At Jurand's approach, the flock arose with a great\r\nnoise, but they soon turned in the air and began to settle on the\r\ncrossbeam of the gallows. Jurand passed them, crossing himself,\r\napproached the moat, and, stopping at the place where the drawbridge was\r\nraised before the gate, sounded the horn.\r\n\r\nHe sounded it a second and a third time and waited. There was no living\r\nsoul upon the walls, nor could a voice be heard within the gates. After a\r\nwhile though, a heavy flap, visible behind a grate built in stone near\r\nthe castle gate, was raised with a crash, and in the opening appeared the\r\nbearded head of a German servant.\r\n\r\n\"_Wer da?_\" inquired a harsh voice.\r\n\r\n\"Jurand of Spychow!\" replied the knight.\r\n\r\nImmediately the flap was closed again and deep silence followed.\r\n\r\nTime passed. No movement was heard behind the gate, only the cawing of\r\nbirds reached his ear from the direction of the gallows.\r\n\r\nJurand stood yet a long time before he raised the horn and sounded it\r\nagain. But silence again was the sole response.\r\n\r\nNow he understood that he was kept before the gate by Teuton pride, which\r\nknew no bounds before the defeated, in order to humiliate him like a\r\nbeggar. He also guessed that he would have to wait thus until evening, or\r\neven longer. Consequently his blood began to boil in the first moments;\r\nhe was suddenly seized with the desire to dismount, pick up one of the\r\nrocks which lay near the moat, and cast it at the grate. He and every\r\nother Mazovian or Polish knight would have done so, under other\r\ncircumstances, and let them come then from behind the gate and fight him.\r\nBut recollecting for what purpose he had come, he bethought himself and\r\ndesisted.\r\n\r\n\"Have I not sacrificed myself for my child?\" he said in his soul.\r\n\r\nAnd he waited.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile something black appeared in the loopholes of the wall. There\r\nappeared heads covered with fur, dark hoods and even iron bars, from\r\nbehind which curious eyes gazed at the knight. More came every moment,\r\nbecause the terrible Jurand, waiting solitarily before the Teuton gate,\r\nwas an unusual sight for the garrison. Whoever had seen him hitherto, had\r\nseen death, but now he could be looked at in safety. The heads constantly\r\nmultiplied till at last all the loopholes near the gate were occupied by\r\nservants. Jurand thought that also the superiors must be looking at him\r\nthrough the grates of the windows in the adjacent tower, and he turned\r\nhis eyes in that direction, but there the windows were cut in deep walls,\r\nand it was impossible to see through them. But in the apertures, the\r\ngroup of people who at first looked at him silently, began to talk. One\r\nafter another repeated his name, here and there laughter was heard, gruff\r\nvoices shouted as if at a wolf, louder and more insolently, and when,\r\napparently, nobody among them interfered, they finally began to throw\r\nsnow at the standing knight. He moved his horse as if involuntarily and\r\nthen for a moment the throwing of snow ceased, voices quieted down, and\r\neven some heads disappeared behind the walls. Surely, Jurand's name must\r\nhave been very menacing! Soon, however, even the most cowardly bethought\r\nthemselves that a moat and a wall separated them from that terrible\r\nMazovian, therefore the rough soldiery again commenced to throw not only\r\nsmall lumps of snow, but also ice, and even shards and stones, which\r\nrebounded with a clang from the armor which covered the horse.\r\n\r\n\"I have sacrificed myself for the child,\" repeated Jurand to himself.\r\n\r\nAnd he waited. Noontime arrived, the walls were deserted, because the\r\nretainers were called to dinner. A few, those that had to be on guard,\r\nate their meal on the wall, and, after having eaten, entertained\r\nthemselves with throwing the picked bones at the hungry knight. They also\r\nbegan to tease and question each other who would dare to descend and\r\nstrike him with the fist in the neck, or with the handle of the lance.\r\nOthers, returning from their meal, called to him that if he disliked\r\nwaiting he could hang himself, because there was a vacant hook on the\r\ngallows with a ready rope. And amidst such mockery, cries, bursts of\r\nlaughter and cursing, the afternoon hours passed. The short wintry day\r\ngradually drew toward evening, and the drawbridge was still up and the\r\ngate remained closed.\r\n\r\nBut toward evening a wind arose, dispersed the mist, cleared the sky and\r\nrevealed the sunset glow.\r\n\r\nThe snow became dark-blue, and then violet. There was no frost, but the\r\nnight promised to be fair. The walls were again deserted by all but the\r\nguard; the rooks and crows departed from the gallows to the forests.\r\nFinally the sky darkened and complete silence followed.\r\n\r\n\"They will not open the gate before nightfall,\" thought Jurand.\r\n\r\nAnd for a moment he thought to return to the city, but he soon gave up\r\nthat idea. \"They want me to stand here,\" he said to himself. \"If I\r\nreturn, they will certainly not let me go home, but surround and capture\r\nme, and then they will say that they owe me nothing, because they took me\r\nby force, and if I should ride over them, even then I must return....\"\r\n\r\nThe great endurance of the Polish knights for cold, hunger and hardships,\r\nso admired by foreign chroniclers, frequently enabled them to perform\r\ndeeds which the less hardy people from the west could not undertake.\r\nJurand possessed that endurance to a still greater degree than others;\r\ntherefore, although hunger had long since began to gripe him, and the\r\nevening frost penetrated his fur, which was covered with iron plates, he\r\ndetermined to wait, even if he had to die before this gate.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly, before it became entirely dark, he heard behind him the\r\nsound of footsteps in the snow.\r\n\r\nHe looked back: there were coming toward him, from the direction of the\r\ncity, six men, armed with lances and halberds; in their midst walked a\r\nseventh man supporting himself on a weapon.\r\n\r\n\"They will perhaps open the gate for them and then I shall ride in with\r\nthem,\" thought Jurand. \"They will not try to take me by force, nor kill\r\nme, because there are too few; should they attack me, however, it will\r\nprove that they do not mean to keep their promise, and then--woe to\r\nthem!\"\r\n\r\nThus thinking, he raised the steel axe hanging at his saddle, so heavy,\r\nthat its weight was too great for the two hands of an ordinary man, and\r\nmoved toward them.\r\n\r\nBut they did not think of attacking him. On the contrary, the servants\r\nplanted their lances and halberds in the snow, and as the night was not\r\nentirely dark yet, Jurand saw that the handles somewhat trembled in their\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nThe seventh, who appeared to be the superior, put out his left arm\r\nquickly, and turning his hand upward, said:\r\n\r\n\"Are you the knight Jurand of Spychow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you wish to hear my message?\"\r\n\r\n\"I listen.\"\r\n\r\n\"The powerful and religious Count von Danveld ordered me to tell you,\r\nlord, that until you dismount, the gate will not be opened for you.\"\r\n\r\nJurand remained motionless for a while, then he dismounted, the horse\r\nbeing instantly taken away by one of the archers.\r\n\r\n\"The arms must be surrendered to us,\" again said the man with the weapon.\r\n\r\nThe lord of Spychow hesitated. Perhaps they would attack him unarmed, and\r\nkill him like a beast; or capture and cast him under ground? But after a\r\nmoment he thought that if it were to be so, they would have sent more\r\nmen. But should they throw themselves on him, they would not destroy his\r\narmor at once, and then he could wrench a weapon from the nearest and\r\nkill them all before assistance could arrive. They knew him well.\r\n\r\n\"And even if they should wish to shed my blood,\" he said to himself, \"I\r\ncame for no other purpose than that.\"\r\n\r\nThus thinking, he threw down first the axe, then the sword, and finally\r\nthe _misericordia_, and waited. They took everything, and then the man\r\nwho had addressed him previously, withdrawing several steps, stopped and\r\nbegan to speak in an insolent, loud voice:\r\n\r\n\"For all the wrongs you have done to the Order, you must, by the count's\r\norders, put on this sack cloth which I leave here, tie around your neck\r\nthe scabbard of your sword with a rope, and wait humbly at the gate until\r\nthe count's grace orders it to be opened for you.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the next moment Jurand remained alone in the darkness and silence. In\r\nthe snow before him the penitential robe and rope showed black while he\r\nstood long, feeling something in his soul dissolving, breaking,\r\nagonizing, dying, and that shortly he would be a knight no more, Jurand\r\nof Spychow no more, but a beggar, a slave without a name, without fame,\r\nwithout respect.\r\n\r\nTherefore, a long time passed before he approached the penitential robe,\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n\"How can I do otherwise? Christ, Thou knowest they will kill the innocent\r\nchild, if I do not do all they order. And Thou also knowest that I would\r\nnot do that for the sake of my own life! Disgrace is a distasteful\r\nthing!... distasteful!--but Thou also wast disgraced of old. Well then,\r\nin the name of the Father and of the Son....\"\r\n\r\nHe then bent down, put on the robe in which were cut the openings for the\r\nhead and hands, then he tied around his neck the scabbard of his sword,\r\nand dragged himself to the gate.\r\n\r\nHe did not find it open; but now it was immaterial to him whether they\r\nopened it sooner or later. The castle sank into nocturnal silence, only\r\nthe guards called now and then to each other on the bastions. In the\r\ntower near the gate there was light in one window high up; the others\r\nwere dark.\r\n\r\nThe night hours flew one after another, on the sky appeared the crescent\r\nmoon and threw light upon the gloomy walls of the castle. It became so\r\nquiet that Jurand was able to hear his own heart-beats. But he stiffened\r\nand became entirely petrified, as if his soul were taken from him, and\r\ntook no account of anything. One thought remained with him, that he had\r\nceased to be a knight, Jurand of Spychow, but what he was he did not\r\nknow.... Sometimes it also seemed to him that in the middle of the night\r\ndeath was coming to him across the snow from those hanged men that he had\r\nseen in the morning....\r\n\r\nSuddenly he quivered and awoke entirely.\r\n\r\n\"O gracious Christ! what is that?\"\r\n\r\nFrom the high window in the adjacent tower, the sounds of a lute, hardly\r\nheard at first, reached his ear. Jurand, while on the way to Szczytno,\r\nwas sure that Danusia was not in the castle, and yet this sound of the\r\nlute at night aroused his heart in an instant. It seemed to him that he\r\nknew those sounds, and that nobody else was playing but she--his child!\r\nhis darling.... He therefore fell upon his knees, clasped his hands to\r\npray, and listened shivering, as in a fever.\r\n\r\nJust then a half-childish and as if ardently longing voice began to sing:\r\n\r\n  \"Had I the dear little wings\r\n    Of a gosling,\r\n  I would fly\r\n    To Jasiek at Szlonsk.\"\r\n\r\nJurand wished to reply, to utter the dear name, but his words were\r\nimprisoned in his throat, as if an iron band squeezed them. A sudden wave\r\nof pain, tears, longing, suffering, collected in his breast; he therefore\r\ncast himself down with his face in the snow and began in ecstasy to call\r\nupon heaven in his soul, as if in thankful prayer:\r\n\r\n\"O Jesus! I hear my child once again! O Jesus!\" ...\r\n\r\nAnd weeping began to tear his gigantic body. Above, the longing voice\r\ncontinued to sing amid the undisturbed silence of the night:\r\n\r\n  \"Would that I might sit\r\n    In the little Szlonsk garden\r\n  To gaze upon little Jasiek\r\n    The poor orphan!\"\r\n\r\nIn the morning a stout, bearded German retainer began to prod the ribs of\r\nthe knight lying at the gate.\r\n\r\n\"Upon your feet, dog!... The gate is open, and the count orders you to\r\nappear before him.\"\r\n\r\nJurand awoke, as if from sleep. He did not catch the man by the throat,\r\nhe did not crush him in his iron hands, he had a quiet and almost humble\r\nface; he arose, and, without saying a word, followed the soldier through\r\nthe gate.\r\n\r\nHe had hardly crossed, when a clang of chains was heard, and the bridge\r\nbegan to be drawn up again, while in the gateway itself fell a heavy iron\r\ngrating.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF PART FOURTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART FIFTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nJurand, finding himself in the castleyard, did not know at first where to\r\ngo, because the servant, who had led him through the gate, had left him\r\nand gone toward the stables. It is true, the soldiers stood near the\r\npalisades, either singly or in groups, but their faces were so insolent,\r\nand their looks so derisive, that the knight could easily guess that they\r\nwould not show him the way, and even if they were to make a reply to his\r\nquestion, it would be a brutal or an indignant one.\r\n\r\nSome laughed, pointing at him with their fingers, others commenced to\r\nthrow snow at him, like yesterday. But he, noticing a door larger than\r\nthe others, over which was cut out in stone Christ on a cross, turned to\r\nit, thinking that if the count and the elders were in another part of the\r\ncastle or in other rooms, somebody must set him right.\r\n\r\nAnd so it happened. The instant Jurand approached that particular door,\r\nboth halves of it opened suddenly, and there stood before it a youth with\r\na head shaven like the clericals, but dressed in a worldly dress, who\r\ninquired:\r\n\r\n\"Are you Sir Jurand of Spychow?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"The pious count ordered me to guide you. Follow me.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he commenced to lead him through a great vaulted vestibule toward a\r\nstaircase. At the stairs though he halted, and casting a glance at\r\nJurand, again inquired:\r\n\r\n\"But have you no weapon with you? I was ordered to search you.\"\r\n\r\nJurand threw up his arms, so that his guide might be able to view his\r\nwhole figure, and replied:\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday I gave up everything.\"\r\n\r\nThen the guide lowered his voice and said almost in a whisper:\r\n\r\n\"Be careful then not to break out into anger, because you are under might\r\nand superior force.\"\r\n\r\n\"But also under God's will,\" returned Jurand.\r\n\r\nThen he looked more carefully at his guide, and observing in his face\r\nsomething in the nature of mercy and sympathy, said:\r\n\r\n\"Honesty looks through your eyes, young man! Will you answer sincerely to\r\nwhat I question?\"\r\n\r\n\"Make haste, sir,\" said the guide.\r\n\r\n\"Will they return the child to me?\"\r\n\r\nAnd the youth raised his brows wonderingly.\r\n\r\n\"Is your child here?\"\r\n\r\n\"My daughter.\"\r\n\r\n\"That lady in the tower near the gate?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. They promised to send her away if I surrendered to them.\"\r\n\r\nThe guide waved his hand to signify that he knew nothing, but his face\r\nexpressed trouble and doubt.\r\n\r\nThen Jurand further asked:\r\n\r\n\"Is it true, that Shomberg and Markward are watching her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Those brethren are not in the castle. Take her away though, sir, ere the\r\nnobleman Danveld regains his health.\"\r\n\r\nHearing that, Jurand shivered, but there was no time to ask any more\r\nquestions, because they had arrived at the hall on the upper floor in\r\nwhich Jurand was to face the chief Shchycienski. The youth, after having\r\nopened the door, retreated toward the stairs.\r\n\r\nThe knight of Spychow entered and found himself in a roomy apartment,\r\nvery dark, because the lead-framed, oval-shaped panes transmitted very\r\nlittle light; furthermore the day was wintry and cloudy. There was, it is\r\ntrue, a fire burning in a large chimney at the other end of the\r\napartment, but the green logs produced little flame. Only after a time,\r\nwhen Jurand's eyes became used to the darkness, he distinguished a table\r\nbehind which were knights sitting, and behind them a whole group of armed\r\nwarriors and servants also armed, among whom the castle fool held a tame\r\nbear by a chain.\r\n\r\nJurand had frequently met Danveld some time before, and afterward had\r\nseen him twice at the court of the prince of Mazowsze, as delegate, but\r\nseveral years had passed since that time; yet, notwithstanding the\r\ndarkness, he recognized him instantly, because of his obesity, his face,\r\nand finally because he sat in the centre behind the table in an armchair,\r\nhis hand being circled by wooden splints and resting upon the arm of the\r\nchair. To his right sat the old Zygfried von Löve of Insburk, an\r\ninexorable foe of the Polish race in general, and particularly of Jurand\r\nof Spychow; to his left were the younger brethren, Godfried and Rotgier.\r\nDanveld had invited them purposely, to witness his triumph over a\r\nthreatening foe, and at the same time to enjoy the fruits of the treason\r\nwhich they had plotted together, and in the accomplishment of which they\r\nhad assisted. They sat now comfortably dressed in soft dark cloth, with\r\nlight swords at their sides. They were joyous and self-confident, and\r\nlooking upon Jurand with that pride and extreme contempt which they\r\nalways bore in their hearts toward the weaker and vanquished.\r\n\r\nThe silence lasted a long while, because they wished to satiate\r\nthemselves with the sight of the man whom they had previously dreaded,\r\nand who stood before them now with his head bowed upon his breast, and\r\ndressed like a penitent in sackcloth, and with a rope around his neck,\r\nupon which was suspended the scabbard of his sword.\r\n\r\nThey also apparently wanted as great a number of people as possible to\r\nwitness his humiliation, for through a side door, leading into other\r\nrooms, whoever pleased entered, and the hall was nearly half filled with\r\narmed men. They all looked with extreme eagerness at Jurand, conversing\r\nloudly and making remarks about him.\r\n\r\nBut he gained confidence, at the sight of them, because he thought to\r\nhimself:\r\n\r\n\"If Danveld did not wish to keep his promise, he would not have ordered\r\nso many witnesses.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Danveld raised his hand, and stopped the conversation; he then\r\nmade a sign to one of the warriors, who approached Jurand, and catching\r\nthe rope which encircled his neck, dragged him a few steps nearer the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nAnd Danveld looked triumphantly at those present and said:\r\n\r\n\"Look, how the power of religion defeats anger and pride.\"\r\n\r\n\"May God always grant it so!\" answered those present.\r\n\r\nThen again followed a moment of silence, after which Danveld turned to\r\nthe prisoner:\r\n\r\n\"You were biting the faith like a mad dog, therefore God has caused you\r\nto stand before us, with a rope around your neck, looking for charity and\r\nmercy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not compare me with a dog, count,\" replied Jurand, \"because you thus\r\nlower the honor of those who met me and fell under my hand.\"\r\n\r\nAt these words the armed Germans commenced to murmur: it was not known\r\nwhether the daring answer aroused their anger or whether they were struck\r\nby its justice.\r\n\r\nBut the count, dissatisfied at such a turn of the conversation, said:\r\n\r\n\"Look, even now he spits into our eyes with arrogance and pride!\"\r\n\r\nJurand then raised his hands, like a man who calls heaven to witness, and\r\nshaking his head, answered:\r\n\r\n\"God sees that my arrogance remained outside your gate; God sees and will\r\njudge, whether in dishonoring my knighthood, you did not dishonor\r\nyourself. There is the honor of a nobleman, which every one who has a\r\nbelt around him, should respect.\"\r\n\r\nDanveld wrinkled his brows, but at that moment the castle fool started to\r\nrattle the chain to which he had fastened the bear, and called out:\r\n\r\n\"Sermon! sermon! the preacher from Mazowsze has arrived! Listen! to the\r\nsermon!\"\r\n\r\nThen turning to Danveld, he said:\r\n\r\n\"Sir! Duke Rosenheim ordered his sexton to eat the bell-rope from knot to\r\nknot whenever the latter awakened him too early for the sermon. This\r\npreacher has also a rope around his neck--make him also eat it up before\r\nhe finishes his sermon.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, having said this, he gazed at the count in some alarm, being\r\nuncertain whether the count would laugh or whether his inappropriate\r\nremark would result in an order for a flogging for him. But the religious\r\nbrethren, gentle, well-behaved, and even humble, whenever they felt they\r\nwere not in power, did not know any limits before the defeated;\r\ntherefore, Danveld not only nodded his head at the bear-leader as a sign\r\nthat he permitted the mockery, but he himself burst out with such\r\nunheard-of roughness that the faces of the younger warriors expressed\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\n\"Don't complain that you were put to shame,\" he said, \"because even if I\r\nhad made you a dogcatcher, a religious dogcatcher is better than you,\r\nknight!\"\r\n\r\nAnd the encouraged fool commenced to shout: \"Bring the currycomb, comb\r\nthe bear, and he in turn will comb your shags with his paws.\"\r\n\r\nAt that, laughter was heard here and there, and a voice exclaimed from\r\nbehind the religious brethren:\r\n\r\n\"You will cut reeds on the lake in the summer!\"\r\n\r\n\"And catch crabs with your carcass!\" exclaimed another.\r\n\r\nA third added: \"And now begin to drive away the crows from the hanging\r\nthief! There will always be plenty of work for you.\"\r\n\r\nThus they made fun of the once terrible Jurand. The assembly gradually\r\nbecame joyous. Some, leaving the table, began to approach the prisoner\r\nand look at him closely, saying:\r\n\r\n\"This is the wild boar of Spychow, whose tusks our count has knocked out;\r\nhis snout is surely foaming; he would gladly tear somebody, but he\r\ncannot!\"\r\n\r\nDanveld and others of the religious brethren, who at first had wished to\r\ngive the hearing the solemn appearance of a court, seeing that the affair\r\nhad turned out differently, also arose from their benches and mingled\r\nwith those who approached Jurand.\r\n\r\nThe old Zygfried of Insburk was dissatisfied at that, but the count\r\nhimself said:\r\n\r\n\"Be cheerful, there will be a greater joy yet!\"\r\n\r\nAnd they also commenced to look at Jurand, for this was a rare\r\nopportunity, because when any of the knights or servants had seen him\r\nbefore from so near, they had usually closed their eyes forever. Some of\r\nthem also remarked:\r\n\r\n\"He is broad shouldered, although he has a fur beneath his sack; he could\r\nbe wrapped up with pease straw, and exhibited in country fairs.\"\r\n\r\nOthers again commenced to ask for beer in order to make the day a still\r\npleasanter one.\r\n\r\nAnd so in a few moments flowing pitchers began to clink and the dark hall\r\nbecame covered with the foam escaping from under the covers. The\r\ngood-humored count said:\r\n\r\n\"That is just right, let him not think that his disgrace is of great\r\nimportance!\"\r\n\r\nSo they again approached him, and touching his chin with their pewters,\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"You would like to drink, Mazovian snout!\" and others, pouring the beer\r\ninto their palms, cast it into his eyes, while he stood among them\r\nstunned and abused, until at last he moved toward the old Zygfried, and\r\napparently feeling that he could not stand it any longer, he began to cry\r\nso loudly as to deafen the noise in the hall:\r\n\r\n\"By the torture of the Saviour and the salvation of the soul, restore to\r\nme my child, as you promised!\"\r\n\r\nAnd he attempted to seize the right hand of the old count who quickly\r\nwithdrew and said:\r\n\r\n\"Avaunt, prisoner! what dost thou want?\"\r\n\r\n\"I released Bergow from prison, and came myself, because in return you\r\npromised to restore my child who is here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who promised you that?\" inquired Danveld.\r\n\r\n\"By the soul and faith, you, count!\"\r\n\r\n\"You will not find any witnesses, but they amount to nothing, if honor\r\nand word are in question.\"\r\n\r\n\"Upon your honor, upon that of the Order,\" exclaimed Jurand.\r\n\r\n\"Then your daughter will be returned to you!\" replied Danveld, and,\r\nturning to the others, remarked: \"All that has happened to him here is an\r\ninnocent trifle in comparison with his violence and crimes. But since we\r\npromised to return his daughter if he should appear and submit himself to\r\nus, then know, that the word of a Knight of the Cross is, like God's\r\nword, irreproachable, and that that girl, whom we saved from the hands of\r\nrobbers, shall now be given her liberty, and after an exemplary penance\r\nfor his sins against the Order, he also shall be allowed to go back to\r\nhis home.\"\r\n\r\nSuch a speech astounded some, because, knowing Danveld and his old hatred\r\nfor Jurand, they did not expect such honesty from him. Therefore old\r\nZygfried, together with Rotgier and Brother Godfried, looked at him,\r\nraising and wrinkling their brows with astonishment, but he pretended not\r\nto observe their inquiring looks and said:\r\n\r\n\"I'll send your daughter back under guard, but you must remain here until\r\nour guard returns safely and until you have paid your ransom.\"\r\n\r\nJurand himself was somewhat astonished, because he had ceased to hope\r\nthat his sacrifice would be of any use to Danusia; he therefore looked at\r\nDanveld, almost with thankfulness and replied:\r\n\r\n\"May God reward you, count!\"\r\n\r\n\"Recognize the Knights of the Cross,\" said Danveld.\r\n\r\n\"All mercy from Him!\" replied Jurand; \"but, since it is long since I saw\r\nmy child, permit me to see and bless my girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah, and not otherwise than before all of us, so that there may be\r\nwitnesses of our good faith and mercy.\"\r\n\r\nThen he ordered the warriors standing near to bring Danusia, while he\r\nhimself approached von Löve, Rotgier and Godfried, who surrounded him and\r\ncommenced a quick and animated conversation.\r\n\r\n\"I do not oppose you, although this was not your object,\" said old\r\nZygfried.\r\n\r\nAnd the hot Rotgier, famous for his courage and cruelties, said: \"How is\r\nthis? not only the girl but also that devilish dog is going to be\r\nliberated, that he may bite again?\"\r\n\r\n\"He will bite not that way only!\" exclaimed Godfried.\r\n\r\n\"Bah! he will pay ransom!\" lazily replied Danveld.\r\n\r\n\"Even if he should return everything, in a year he will have robbed twice\r\nas much.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall not object as to the girl,\" repeated Zygfried; \"but this wolf\r\nwill yet make the sheep of the Order weep more than once.\"\r\n\r\n\"And our word?\" queried Danveld, laughingly.\r\n\r\n\"You spoke differently....\"\r\n\r\nDanveld shrugged his shoulders. \"Did you not have enough pleasure?\" he\r\ninquired. \"Do you wish more?\"\r\n\r\nOthers surrounded Jurand again and commenced to brag before him, praising\r\nthe upright conduct of Danveld, and the impression it made upon the\r\nmembers of the Order.\r\n\r\n\"And what bone breaker!\" said the captain of the castle-archers. \"Your\r\nheathen brethren would not have treated our Christian knights so!\"\r\n\r\n\"You drank our blood?\"\r\n\r\n\"And we give you bread for stones.\"\r\n\r\nBut Jurand paid no attention either to the pride or to the contempt which\r\ntheir words contained: his heart swelled and his eyelashes were moist. He\r\nthought that he would see Danusia in a moment, and that he would see her\r\nactually by their favor; he therefore gazed at the speakers almost with\r\nhumility, and finally said:\r\n\r\n\"True! true! I used to be hard on you but ... not treacherous.\"\r\n\r\nThat instant a voice at the other end of the hall suddenly cried: \"They\r\nare bringing the girl;\" and immediately silence reigned throughout the\r\nhall. The soldiers scattered to both sides, because none of them had ever\r\nseen Jurand's daughter, and the majority of them did not even know of her\r\npresence in the castle on account of the secrecy with which Danveld\r\nsurrounded his actions; but those who knew, whispered to one another\r\nabout her admirable grace. All eyes turned with extreme curiosity toward\r\nthe door through which she was to appear.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a warrior appeared in front followed by the well-known servant\r\nof the Order, the same woman that rode to the court in the forest. After\r\nher entered a girl dressed in white, with loose hair tied with a ribbon\r\non the forehead.\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly one great outburst of laughter, like the roaring of thunder,\r\nrang through the entire hall. Jurand, who at the first moment had sprung\r\ntoward his daughter, suddenly recoiled and stood as pale as linen,\r\nlooking with surprise at the ill-shaped head, the bluish lips, and the\r\nexpressionless eyes of the wench who was restored to him as Danusia.\r\n\r\n\"This is not my daughter!\" he said, in a terrifying voice.\r\n\r\n\"Not your daughter?\" exclaimed Danveld. \"By the holy Liboryusz of\r\nPaderborn! Then either we did not rescue your daughter from the murderers\r\nor some wizard has changed her, because there is no other in Szczytno.\"\r\n\r\nOld Zygfried, Rotgier and Godfried exchanged quick glances with each\r\nother, full of admiration at the shrewdness of Danveld, but none of them\r\nhad time enough to speak, because Jurand began to shout with a terrible\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n\"She is, she is in Szczytno! I heard her sing, I heard the voice of dear\r\nDanusia!\"\r\n\r\nUpon that Danveld turned to those assembled and said quietly but\r\npointedly:\r\n\r\n\"I take you all present as witnesses and especially you, Zygfried of\r\nInsburk, and you pious brothers, Rotgier and Godfried, that, according to\r\nmy word and given promise, I restore that girl, who was said by the\r\nrobbers whom we defeated, to be the daughter of Jurand of Spychow. If she\r\nis not--it is not our fault, but rather the will of our Lord, who in that\r\nmanner wished to deliver Jurand into our hands.\"\r\n\r\nZygfried and the two younger brethren bowed to signify that they heard\r\nand would testify in case of necessity. Then again they glanced quickly\r\nat each other, because it was more than they ever could have expected to\r\ncapture Jurand, not to restore his daughter, and still ostensibly to keep\r\na promise; who else could do that?\r\n\r\nBut Jurand threw himself upon his knees and commenced to conjure Danveld\r\nby all the relics in Malborg, then by the ashes and heads of his parents,\r\nto restore to him his true child and not proceed like a swindler and\r\ntraitor, breaking oaths and promises. His voice contained so much despair\r\nand truth, that some began to suspect treason; others again thought that\r\nsome wizard had actually changed the appearance of the girl.\r\n\r\n\"God looks upon your treason!\" exclaimed Jurand. \"By the Saviour's\r\nwounds, by the hour of your death, return my child!\"\r\n\r\nAnd arising, he went bent double toward Danveld, as if he wished to\r\nembrace his knees; and his eyes glittered with madness, and his voice\r\nbroke alternately with pain, fear, and dread. Danveld, hearing the\r\naccusations of treason and deceit in presence of all, commenced to snort,\r\nand at length his features worked with rage; so that like a flame in his\r\ndesire utterly to crush the unfortunate, he advanced and bending down to\r\nhis ear, whispered through his set teeth: \"If I ever give her up, it will\r\nbe with my bastard....\"\r\n\r\nBut at that very moment Jurand roared like a bull, and with both hands he\r\ncaught Danveld and raised him high in the air.\r\n\r\nThe hall still resounded with the terrible cry: \"Save me!\" when the body\r\nof the count struck the stone floor with such terrible force that the\r\nbrains from the shattered skull bespattered Zygfried and Rotgier who\r\nstood by. Jurand sprang to the wall, near which stood the arms, and\r\nsnatching a large two-handed weapon, ran like a storm at the Germans, who\r\nwere petrified with terror. The people were used to battles, butchery and\r\nblood, and yet their hearts sank to such an extent that even after the\r\npanic had passed, they commenced to retreat and escape like a flock of\r\nsheep before a wolf who kills with one stroke of his claws. The hall\r\nresounded with the cry of terror, with the sound of human footsteps, the\r\nclang of the overturned vessels, the howling of the servants, the\r\ngrowling of the bear, who, tearing himself out of the hands of the\r\ntrainer, started to climb on a high window, and a terror-stricken cry for\r\narms and targets, weapons and crossbows. Finally weapons gleamed, and a\r\nnumber of sharp points were directed toward Jurand, but he, not caring\r\nfor anything, half crazed, sprang toward them, and there commenced an\r\nunheard-of wild fight, resembling a butchery more than a contest of arms.\r\nThe young and fiery Brother Godfried was the first to intercept Jurand's\r\nway, but he severed his head, hand and shoulder-blade with a lightning\r\nswing of his weapon; after him fell by Jurand's hand the captain of the\r\narchers, and the castle administrator, von Bracht and the Englishman\r\nHugues, who, although he did not very well understand the cause, pitied\r\nJurand and his sufferings, and only drew his weapon when Danveld was\r\nkilled. Others, seeing the terrible force and the fury of the man,\r\ngathered closely together, so as to offer combined resistance, but this\r\nplan brought about a still greater defeat, because he, with his hair\r\nstanding upright on his head, with maddened eyes, covered all over with\r\nblood, panting, raging and furious, broke, tore and cut with terrible\r\nstrokes of his sword that battered group, casting men to the floor,\r\nsplashed all over with clotted blood, as a storm overturns bushes and\r\ntrees. Then followed a moment of terrific fright, in which it seemed that\r\nthis terrible Mazovian, all by himself, would hew and slay all these\r\npeople. Like a pack of barking hounds that cannot overpower a fierce boar\r\nwithout the assistance of the hunters, so were those armed Germans; they\r\ncould not match his might and fierceness in that fight which resulted\r\nonly in their death and discomfiture.\r\n\r\n\"Scatter! surround him! strike from behind!\" shrieked old Zygfried von\r\nLöve.\r\n\r\nThey consequently dispersed through the hall like a flock of starlings in\r\nthe field upon which a hawk with crooked beak swoops from a height, but\r\nthey could not surround him, because, in the heat of the fight, instead\r\nof looking for a place of defence, he commenced to chase them around the\r\nwalls and whoever was overtaken died as if thunderstruck. Humiliation,\r\ndespair, disappointed hope, changed into one thirst for blood, seemed to\r\nmultiply tenfold his terrific natural strength. A weapon, for which the\r\nmost powerful of the Knights of the Cross needed both hands, he managed\r\nto wield with one as if it were a feather. He did not care for his life,\r\nnor look for escape; he did not even crave for victory; he sought\r\nrevenge, and like a fire, or like a river, which breaking a dam, blindly\r\ndestroys everything obstructing its flow, so he, a terrible, blindfolded\r\ndestroyer, tore, broke, trampled, killed and extinguished human beings.\r\nThey could not hurt him in his back, because, in the beginning they were\r\nunable to overtake him; moreover the common soldiers feared to come near\r\nhim even from behind; they knew that if he happened to turn no human\r\npower could save them from death. Others were simply terror-stricken at\r\nthe thought, that an ordinary man could cause so much havoc, and that\r\nthey were dealing with a man who was aided by some superhuman power.\r\n\r\nBut old Zygfried, and with him Brother Rotgier, rushed to the gallery\r\nwhich extended above the large windows of the hall, and commenced to call\r\nothers to take shelter after them; these did so in haste, so that, on the\r\nnarrow stairs, they pushed each other in their desire to get up as\r\nquickly as possible and thence to strike the strong knight, with whom any\r\nhand to hand struggle appeared to them impossible.\r\n\r\nFinally, the last one banged the door leading to the gallery and Jurand\r\nremained alone below. From the gallery the sounds of joy and triumph\r\nreached him, and soon heavy oak benches and iron collars of torches began\r\nto fall upon the nobleman. One of the missiles struck him on the forehead\r\nand bathed his face with blood. At the same time the large entrance door\r\nopened, and through the upper windows the summoned servants rushed into\r\nthe hall in a body, armed with pikes, halberds, axes, crossbows,\r\npalisades, poles, ropes and all varieties of weapons, which they could\r\nhurriedly get hold of. And with his left hand the mad Jurand wiped the\r\nblood from his face, so as not to obstruct his sight, gathered himself\r\ntogether, and threw himself at the entire throng. In the hall again\r\nresounded groans, the clash of iron, the gnashing of teeth and the\r\npiercing voices of the slain men.\r\n\r\nIn the same hall, behind the table that evening, sat old Zygfried von\r\nLöve, who, after the bailiff Danveld, temporarily took command of\r\nSzczytno, and near him were Brother Rotgier, and the knight von Bergow, a\r\nformer prisoner of Jurand's and two noble youths, novices, who were soon\r\nto put on white mantles. The wintry storm was howling outside the\r\nwindows, shaking the leaden window-frames; the torchlights, which were\r\nburning in iron frames, wavered, and now and then the wind drove clouds\r\nof smoke from the chimney into the hall. Silence reigned among the\r\nbrethren, although they were assembled for a consultation, because they\r\nwere waiting for the word from Zygfried, who, again resting his elbows on\r\nthe table and running his hands over his grey and bowed head, sat gloomy\r\nwith his face in the shadow and with sullen thoughts in his soul.\r\n\r\n\"About what are we to deliberate?\" finally asked Brother Rotgier.\r\n\r\nZygfried raised his head, looked at the speaker, and, awakening from\r\nthought, said:\r\n\r\n\"About the defeat, about what the master and the assembly will say, and\r\nabout this, that our actions may not cause any loss to the Order.\" He was\r\nsilent again, but after a while he looked around and moved his nostrils:\r\n\"There is still a smell of blood here.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, count,\" replied Rotgier; \"I ordered the floor to be scrubbed and the\r\nplace to be fumigated with sulphur. It is the odor of sulphur.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Zygfried looked at those present with a strange glance, and said:\r\n\"God have mercy upon the soul of our brothers Danveld and Godfried!\"\r\n\r\nThey again understood that he implored God's mercy upon their souls,\r\nbecause, at the mention of sulphur, he thought of hell; therefore a chill\r\nran through their bones and all at once replied: \"Amen! amen! amen!\"\r\nAfter a moment the howling of the wind and the rattling of the\r\nwindow-frames were heard again.\r\n\r\n\"Where are the bodies of the count and Brother Godfried?\" inquired the\r\nold man.\r\n\r\n\"In the chapel: the priests are chanting the litany over them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are they already in coffins?\"\r\n\r\n\"In coffins, only the count's head is covered, because his skull and face\r\nare crushed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are the other corpses, and where are the wounded?\"\r\n\r\n\"The corpses are in the snow so as to stiffen whilst the coffins are\r\nbeing made, and the wounded are being attended to in the hospital.\"\r\n\r\nZygfried again ran his hands over his head.\r\n\r\n\"And one man did that!... God, have the Order under Thy care, when it\r\ncomes to a great war with this wolfish race!\"\r\n\r\nUpon that Rotgier turned up his eyes, as if recollecting something, and\r\nsaid: \"I heard in Wilno, how the bailiff of Samboz spoke to his brother\r\nthe master: 'If you do not make a great war and get rid of them, so that\r\neven their name shall not remain, then woe to us and our nation.'\"\r\n\r\n\"May God give such a war and a meeting with them!\" said one of the noble\r\nnovices.\r\n\r\nZygfried looked at him for some time, as if he wanted to say: \"You could\r\nhave met one of them to-day,\" but seeing the small and youthful figure of\r\nthe novice, and perhaps remembering that he himself, although famous for\r\nhis courage, did not care to expose himself to a sure destruction,\r\nrefrained and inquired:\r\n\r\n\"Who saw Jurand?\"\r\n\r\n\"I,\" replied von Bergow.\r\n\r\n\"Is he alive?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he lies in the same net in which we entrapped him. When he awoke\r\nthe servants wanted to kill him, but the chaplain would not allow it.\"\r\n\r\n\"He cannot be executed. He is too great a man among his people, and there\r\nwould be a terrible clamor,\" replied Zygfried. \"It will be also\r\nimpossible to hide what has happened, because there were too many\r\nwitnesses.\"\r\n\r\n\"What then are we to say and do?\" inquired Rotgier.\r\n\r\nZygfried meditated, and finally said:\r\n\r\n\"You, noble Count von Bergow go to Malborg to the master. You were\r\ngroaning in Jurand's slavery, and are now a guest of the Order; therefore\r\nas such, and because you need not necessarily speak in favor of the\r\nmonks, they will rather believe you. Tell, then, what you saw, that\r\nDanveld, having recovered from a band of rogues a certain girl and\r\nthinking her to be Jurand's daughter, informed the latter, who also came\r\nto Szczytno, and what happened further you know yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, pious count,\" said von Bergow. \"I suffered great hardships as\r\na slave in Spychow, and as your guest, I would gladly testify for you;\r\nbut tell me, for the sake of quieting my soul, whether there was not a\r\nreal daughter of Jurand's in Szczytno, and whether it was not Danveld's\r\ntreason that drove her father to madness?\"\r\n\r\nZygfried von Löve hesitated for a moment with his answer; in his nature\r\nlay deep hatred toward the Polish nation, and barbarity in which he\r\nexceeded even Danveld, and rapacity, and, when the Order was in question,\r\npride and avarice, but there was no falsehood. It was the greatest\r\nbitterness and grief of his life, that lately, through insubordination\r\nand riot, the affairs of the Order had turned in such a manner that\r\nfalsehood had become one of the most general and unavoidable factors of\r\nthe life of the Order. Therefore von Bergow's inquiry touched the most\r\npainful string of his soul, and, after a long silence, he said:\r\n\r\n\"Danveld stands before God, and God will judge him, while you, duke,\r\nshould they ask you for conjectures, answer what you please; should they\r\nagain ask you about what you saw, then say that before we coiled a wild\r\nman in a net you saw nine corpses, besides the wounded, on this floor,\r\nand among them the bodies of Danveld, Brother Godfried, von Bracht and\r\nHugues, and two noble youths.... God, give them eternal peace. Amen!\"\r\n\r\n\"Amen! Amen!\" again repeated the novices.\r\n\r\n\"And say also,\" added Zygfried, \"that although Danveld wished to subdue\r\nthe foe of the Order, yet nobody here raised the first weapon against\r\nJurand.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall say only what my eyes saw,\" replied von Bergow.\r\n\r\n\"Be in the chapel before midnight; we shall also go there to pray for the\r\nsouls of the dead,\" answered Zygfried.\r\n\r\nHe then extended his hand to him as a sign of gratitude and farewell; he\r\nwished to remain for a further consultation alone with Brother Rotgier,\r\nwhom he loved and had great confidence in. After the withdrawal of von\r\nBergow, he also dismissed the two novices, under the pretence that they\r\nmight watch the work of the coffins for the common servants killed by\r\nJurand, and after the doors had closed behind them he turned with\r\nanimation to Rotgier, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Listen to what I am going to say: there is only one remedy: that no\r\nliving soul should ever find out that the real daughter of Jurand was\r\nwith us.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will not be difficult,\" replied Rotgier, \"because nobody knew that\r\nshe was here except Danveld, Godfried, we two, and those servants of the\r\nOrder who watched her. Danveld ordered the people who brought her here to\r\nbe made intoxicated and hanged. There were some among the garrison who\r\nsuspected something, but that affair confused them, and they do not know\r\nnow themselves whether an error happened on our part, or whether some\r\nwizard really exchanged Jurand's daughter.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is good,\" said Zygfried.\r\n\r\n\"I have been thinking again, noble count, whether, since Danveld lives no\r\nlonger, we should not cast all the guilt upon him....\"\r\n\r\n\"And so admit before the whole world that we, in a time of peace and\r\nconcord with the prince of Mazowsze, ravished from his court the pupil of\r\nthe princess and her beloved courtlady? No, for God's sake! this cannot\r\nbe!... We were seen at the court together with Danveld; and the grand\r\nmaster, his relative, knows that we always undertook everything\r\ntogether.... If we accuse Danveld, he may desire to avenge his\r\nmemory....\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us consult on that,\" said Rotgier. \"Let us consult and find good\r\nadvice, because otherwise woe to us! If we return Jurand's daughter, then\r\nshe will say herself that we did not capture her from robbers, but that\r\nthe people who caught her carried her directly to Szczytno.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is so.\"\r\n\r\n\"And God is witness that I do not care for the responsibility alone. The\r\nprince will complain to the Polish king, and their delegates will not\r\nfail to clamor at all courts against our outrages, our treason, and our\r\ncrime. God alone knows how much loss the Order may suffer from it. The\r\nmaster himself, if he knew the truth, ought to order that girl to be\r\nhidden.\"\r\n\r\n\"And even if so, when that girl is lost, will they not accuse us?\"\r\ninquired Rotgier.\r\n\r\n\"No! Brother Danveld was a shrewd man. Do you remember, that he imposed\r\nthe condition on Jurand, that he should not only appear in Szczytno\r\npersonally, but also previously proclaim and write to the prince, that he\r\nis going to ransom his daughter from the robbers, and that he knows that\r\nshe is not with us.\"\r\n\r\n\"True! but in that case how shall we justify what happened in Szczytno?\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall say that knowing that Jurand was looking for his child, and\r\nhaving captured some girl from the robbers and not being able to tell who\r\nshe was, we informed Jurand, thinking that this might possibly be his\r\ndaughter; on his arrival he fell into a fit at the sight of her, and,\r\nbeing possessed with the devil, shed so much innocent blood that more\r\nthan one battle does not cost so much.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true,\" replied Rotgier, \"wisdom and the experience of age speak\r\nthrough you. The bad deeds of Danveld, even if we should throw the guilt\r\non him, would always go to the account of the Order, therefore, to the\r\naccount of all of us, the assembly and the master himself; so again our\r\ninnocence will become apparent, and all will fall upon Jurand, the\r\niniquity of the Poles and their connection with infernal powers....\"\r\n\r\n\"And then whoever wishes may judge us; the Pope, or the Roman Emperor!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes!\" Then followed a moment of silence, after which Brother Rotgier\r\nquestioned:\r\n\r\n\"What shall we do then with Jurand's daughter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us consult.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give her to me.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Zygfried looked at him and replied:\r\n\r\n\"No I Listen, young brother! When the Order is in question, do not trust\r\na man, woman nor even your own self. Danveld was reached by God's hand,\r\nbecause he not only wished to revenge the wrongs of the Order, but also\r\nto satisfy his own desires.\"\r\n\r\n\"You misjudge me!\" said Rotgier.\r\n\r\n\"Do not trust yourself,\" interrupted Zygfried, \"because your body and\r\nsoul will become effeminate, and the knee of that hard race will some day\r\nbear heavily upon your breast, so that you will not be able to arise any\r\nmore.\" And he the third time rested his gloomy head on his hand, but he\r\napparently conversed with his own conscience only, and thought of himself\r\nonly, because he said after a while:\r\n\r\n\"Much human blood, much pain, many tears weigh heavily on me also ...\r\nmoreover I did not hesitate to seek other means, when the Order was in\r\nquestion, and when I saw I should not succeed by mere force; but when I\r\nstand before the Almighty, I shall tell Him: 'I did that for the Order,\r\nand for myself--what I chose.'\"\r\n\r\nAnd having said this, he put his hands to his breast and opened a dark\r\ncloth garment, beneath which appealed a sackcloth. He then pressed his\r\ntemples with his hands, raised his head and eyes, and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Give up pleasures and profligacy, harden your bodies and hearts, because\r\neven now I see the whiteness of the eagle's feathers in the air and its\r\nclaws reddened with Teutonic blood!...\"\r\n\r\nFurther speech was interrupted by such a terrible knock of the gate that\r\none window above the gallery opened with a crash, and the entire hall was\r\nfilled with a howling and whistling of the storm and with snowflakes.\r\n\r\n\"In the name of God, His Son and the Holy Ghost! this is a bad night,\"\r\nremarked the old Teuton.\r\n\r\n\"A night of unclean powers,\" answered Rotgier.\r\n\r\n\"Are there priests with Danveld's body?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.... He departed without absolution.... God have mercy upon him!\"\r\n\r\nAnd both ceased speaking. Rotgier presently called some boys, and ordered\r\nthem to shut the window and light the torches, and after they had gone\r\naway, he again inquired:\r\n\r\n\"What will you do with Jurand's daughter? Will you take her away from\r\nhere to Insburk?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall take her to Insburk and do with her what the good of the Order\r\ndemands.\"\r\n\r\n\"What am I to do then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you courage in your heart?\"\r\n\r\n\"What have I done to make you doubt it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I doubt not because I know you and love you as my own son for your\r\ncourage. Go then to the court of the prince of Mazowsze and narrate\r\neverything that has happened here, according to our arrangement.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can I expose myself to certain destruction?\"\r\n\r\n\"You ought, if your destruction will bring glory to the Cross and Order.\r\nBut no! Destruction does not await you. They do no harm to a guest:\r\nunless somebody should challenge you, as that young knight did who\r\nchallenged us all ... he, or somebody else, but that is not terrible....\"\r\n\r\n\"May God grant it! they can seize me though and cast me under ground.\"\r\n\r\n\"They will not do that. Remember that there is Jurand's letter to the\r\nprince, and besides that you will go to accuse Jurand. Narrate faithfully\r\nwhat he did in Szczytno, and they must believe you.... We were even the\r\nfirst to inform him that there was a certain girl; we were the first to\r\ninvite him to come to see her, and he came, went mad, killed the count\r\nand slew our people. Thus you will speak, and what can they say to you?\r\nDanveld's death will certainly resound throughout the whole Mazowsze. On\r\nthat account they will fail to bring charges. They will actually look for\r\nJurand's daughter, but, since Jurand himself wrote that she is not here,\r\nno suspicion will fall upon us. It is necessary to face them boldly and\r\nclose their mouths, because they will also think that if we were guilty,\r\nnone of us would dare to go there.\"\r\n\r\n\"True! I will set out on the journey immediately after Danveld's\r\nfuneral.\"\r\n\r\n\"May God bless you, my dear son! If you do all properly, they not only\r\nwill not detain you, but they will have to disavow Jurand, so that we may\r\nnot be able to say: 'Look how they treat us!'\"\r\n\r\n\"And so we must sue at all courts.\"\r\n\r\n\"The grand master will attend to that for the benefit of the Order,\r\nbesides being Danveld's relative.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if that devil of Spychow should survive and regain his liberty!...\"\r\n\r\nA dark look came into Zygfried's eyes and he replied slowly and\r\nemphatically:\r\n\r\n\"Even if he should regain his liberty, he will never utter a word of\r\naccusation against the Order.\"\r\n\r\nHe then commenced again to instruct Rotgier, what to say and demand at\r\nthe court in Mazowsze.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nThe rumor of the occurrence in Szczytno arrived in Warsaw however before\r\nBrother Rotgier, and there excited amazement and concern. Neither the\r\nking himself, nor anybody else at the court, could understand what had\r\nhappened. Shortly before, just when Mikolaj of Dlugolas was starting for\r\nMalborg with the prince's letter, in which he bitterly complained of the\r\ncapture of Danusia by turbulent border counts and almost threateningly\r\ndemanded her instant restoration, a letter had arrived from the owner of\r\nSpychow stating that his daughter was not captured by the Teutons, but by\r\nordinary border bandits, and that she would be soon released for a\r\nransom. On that account the messenger did not leave; nobody ever dreamed\r\nof the Teutons extorting such a letter from Jurand by the threat of his\r\ndaughter's death. It was difficult to understand what had happened,\r\nbecause the border chiefs, who were subjects of the prince as well as of\r\nthe Order, attacked one another in the summer, but not in the winter when\r\nthe snows betrayed their trail. They also usually attacked merchants, or\r\nperpetrated robberies in the villages, capturing people and seizing their\r\nherds, but to dare to attack the prince himself and to capture his\r\nprotégée, who was at the same time the daughter of a powerful and\r\nuniversally feared knight, this seemed entirely to exceed human belief.\r\nThis, as well as other doubts, was answered by Jurand's letter under his\r\nown seal, brought this time by a man who was known to come from Spychow;\r\nunder such circumstances all suspicions became impossible; the prince\r\nonly became more enraged than he had ever been seen before, and he\r\nordered a pursuit of the ravishers throughout the border of his\r\nprincipality, at the same time ordering the prince of Plock to do the\r\nsame and not fail to punish the insolent fellows.\r\n\r\nJust then arrived the news of what had happened at Szczytno.\r\n\r\nAnd as it passed from mouth to mouth, it was multiplied tenfold. It was\r\nsaid that Jurand, having arrived all alone in the castle, ran in through\r\nthe open gate and there committed such slaughter that the garrison was so\r\nterrified that it had to send for help to the neighboring castles, to\r\nsummon the superior knighthood and armed foot-soldiers, who only after a\r\ntwo days' siege succeeded in reentering the castle and there slaying\r\nJurand as well as his associates. It was also said that those forces\r\nwould probably cross the border, and that a great war would undoubtedly\r\nbegin. The prince, who knew of how great consequence it was to the grand\r\nmaster in case of war with the Polish king for the powers of both\r\nprincipalities of Mazowsze to remain neutral, did not believe these\r\nstories, because it was no secret to him, that should the Teutons declare\r\nwar on him or the principality of Plock, no human power could keep the\r\nPoles back; the master therefore dreaded that war. He knew that it must\r\ncome, but he wished to postpone it, firstly, because he was of a peaceful\r\ndisposition, and secondly, because, in order to meet Jagiello's power, it\r\nwas necessary to gather a strength which the Order until now had never\r\nyet possessed, and at the same time to secure the assistance of the\r\nprinces and knighthood, not only in Germany, but also in the entire West.\r\n\r\nThe prince, therefore, did not fear the war, but he wished to know what\r\nhad happened, what he really was to think of the occurrence in Szczytno,\r\nof the disappearance of Danusia, and all those stories which arrived from\r\nthe border; he was also glad, although he hated the Teutons, when on a\r\ncertain evening the captain of the archers informed him that a knight of\r\nthe Order had arrived and begged for an audience.\r\n\r\nHe received him proudly, nevertheless, and although he recognized him\r\ninstantly as one of the brethren who were in the Forest Court, he\r\npretended not to recollect him and inquired who he was, whence he came,\r\nand what caused his arrival in Warsaw.\r\n\r\n\"I am Brother Rotgier,\" replied the Teuton, \"and a short time ago I had\r\nthe honor to bow before your Highness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why then, being a brother, do you not wear the insignia of the Order?\"\r\n\r\nThe knight commenced to explain that he did not wear a white cloak,\r\nbecause by so doing he would be undoubtedly captured or killed by the\r\nknighthood of Mazowsze: throughout the whole world, in all kingdoms and\r\nprincipalities, the sign of the cross on the cloak is a protection and\r\ngains human good-will and hospitality, and only in the principality of\r\nMazowsze does the cross expose the man who wears it to certain death.\r\n\r\nBut the prince interrupted him angrily:\r\n\r\n\"Not the cross,\" he said, \"because we also kiss it, but your vices and if\r\nthey receive you better elsewhere it is, because they do not know you so\r\nwell.\"\r\n\r\nThen, seeing that the knight was greatly troubled at these words, he\r\ninquired: \"Were you in Szczytno, do you know what happened there?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was in Szczytno and know what happened there,\" replied Rotgier, \"and I\r\ncame here not as any one's messenger, but only because the experienced\r\nand pious count of Insburk told me: 'Our master loves the pious prince\r\nand trusts in his justice, therefore while I hasten to Malborg, you go to\r\nMazowsze and state our grievance, our disgrace, our misery. The just lord\r\nwill surely not praise a violator of peace and a cruel aggressor, who has\r\nshed so much Christian blood, as though he were not Christ's servant but\r\nSatan's.'\" And then he commenced to narrate everything that had occurred\r\nin Szczytno: How Jurand, who had been summoned by them to see whether the\r\ngirl whom they had taken away from the robbers was not his daughter,\r\ninstead of repaying that with thankfulness, had fallen into a fit; how he\r\nhad killed Danveld, Brother Godfried, the Englishmen Hugues, von Bracht\r\nand two noble warriors, not counting the servants; how they, remembering\r\nGod's commandment and not wishing to kill, had finally been compelled to\r\ncoil the terrible man in a net, who had then turned his sword against\r\nhimself and wounded himself terribly; how lastly, not only in the castle\r\nbut also in the tower, there were people, who, in the midst of a wintry\r\ngale during the night after the fight, had heard terrible laughter and\r\nvoices in the air calling: \"Our Jurand! Wrongdoer of the cross! Shedder\r\nof innocent blood! Our Jurand!\"\r\n\r\nAnd the whole story, especially the last words of the Teuton, made a\r\ngreat impression upon all present. Terror fell upon them all. They were\r\nsimply overwhelmed with fear lest Jurand had actually summoned unclean\r\npowers to his assistance, and deep silence followed. But the princess,\r\nwho was present at the audience, and who, loving Danusia, had a heart\r\nfull of inconsolable sorrow for her, turned with an unexpected question\r\nto Rotgier: \"You say, knight,\" she remarked, \"that, after capturing the\r\ngirl, you thought her to be Jurand's daughter, and therefore summoned him\r\nto Szczytno?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, beloved lady,\" replied Rotgier.\r\n\r\n\"How could you have thought so, since you saw the real daughter of Jurand\r\nwith me in the Forest Court?\"\r\n\r\nAt that Brother Rotgier became embarrassed, because he was not prepared\r\nfor such a question. The prince arose and fixed a severe look on the\r\nTeuton, while Mikolaj of Dlugolas, Mrokota of Mocarzew, Jasko of\r\nJagielnica and other knights of Mazowsze instantly sprang toward the\r\nbrother, inquiring alternately with threatening voices:\r\n\r\n\"How could you have thought so? Speak, German I How could that be?\"\r\n\r\nAnd Brother Rotgier recovered himself and said: \"We brethren do not raise\r\nour eyes to women. In the Forest Court with the beloved princess there\r\nwere many court ladies, but which among them was Jurand's daughter, none\r\nof us knew.\"\r\n\r\n\"Danveld knew,\" said Mikolaj of Dlugolas. \"He even talked to her during\r\nthe hunt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Danveld stands before God,\" replied Rotgier, \"and of him I shall only\r\nsay that the following morning blooming roses were found on his coffin,\r\nwhich, in this wintry weather, could not come there by human hands.\"\r\n\r\nThen again followed silence.\r\n\r\n\"How did you know of the capture of Jurand's daughter?\" inquired the\r\nprince.\r\n\r\n\"Only the wickedness and audacity of the deed made it known to us.\r\nTherefore on hearing about it, we ordered thanksgiving masses because\r\nonly a plain court lady, and not one of the children born of your\r\nHighness, was captured from the Forest Court.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I still wonder, how you could mistake a wench for Jurand's\r\ndaughter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Danveld said: 'Often Satan betrayed his servants, so perhaps he changed\r\nJurand's daughter.'\"\r\n\r\n\"The robbers though, as vulgar men, could not counterfeit Kaleb's writing\r\nand Jurand's seal. Who could have done it?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Evil Spirit.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again nobody could find an answer.\r\n\r\nRotgier glanced searchingly into the prince's eyes and said: \"Indeed,\r\nthese questions are like weapons in my breast, because they contain doubt\r\nand suspicion. But I trust in God's justice and the power of truth. I ask\r\nof your majesty: even Jurand himself suspected us of that action, and\r\nwhen suspecting, before we summoned him to Szczytno, why did he search\r\nfor robbers through the whole border in order to buy his daughter back\r\nfrom them?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is true!\" said the prince. \"Even if you were hiding something from\r\nmen, you cannot hide it from God. He suspected you in the first moment\r\nbut then ... then he thought differently.\"\r\n\r\n\"Behold how the brightness of truth conquers the darkness,\" said Rotgier,\r\nand he glanced triumphantly around the hall; he thought that Teutonic\r\nheads had more adroitness and sense than the Polish, and that the latter\r\nrace would always be the prey and food of the Order, as a fly is the prey\r\nand food of the spider.\r\n\r\nTherefore, throwing off his previous disguise, he approached the prince\r\nand commenced to speak in loud and impetuous tones:\r\n\r\n\"Requite us, lord, our losses, our grievances, our tears, and our blood!\r\nThat hell-hound was your subject; therefore, in the name of God from whom\r\nthe power of kings and princes is derived, in the name of justice and the\r\ncross, requite us for our grievances and blood!\"\r\n\r\nBut the prince looked at him in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"For God's sake!\" he said, \"what do you want? if Jurand shed your blood\r\nin madness, am I to answer for his frenzy?\"\r\n\r\n\"He was your subject, lord,\" said the Teuton, \"in your principality lie\r\nhis possessions, his villages and his castle, in which he imprisoned the\r\nservants of the Order; at least let these possessions, this domain and\r\nthat wicked castle, become henceforth the property of the Order. Truly\r\nthis will not be an adequate payment for the noble blood shed! truly it\r\nwill not revive the dead, but perhaps it will partly appease God's anger\r\nand wipe away the disgrace, which will otherwise fall upon this entire\r\nprincipality. O, lord! The Order possesses grounds and castles\r\neverywhere, which were given to it by the favor and piety of the\r\nChristian princes, and only here in your territory have we no particle of\r\nland. Let our grievance, which calls to God for vengeance, be at least so\r\nrewarded that we may say that here also live people, who have the fear of\r\nGod in their hearts!\" Hearing this, the prince was still more amazed, and\r\nthen, after a long silence, replied:\r\n\r\n\"For God's sake! And through whose clemency, if not through that of my\r\nancestors, does your Order even exist here? The lands, estates and\r\ntowers, which once upon a time belonged to us and our nation, and which\r\nnow are your property, do these not suffice for you yet? Jurand's girl is\r\nyet alive because nobody has informed you of her death, while you already\r\nwant to seize the orphan's dower, and requite your grievances with an\r\norphan's bread?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lord, you admit the wrong,\" said Rotgier, \"consequently right it\r\naccording to what your princely conscience and your honest soul\r\ndictates.\" And he was again glad in his heart, because he thought: \"Now,\r\nthey not only will not sue but they will even consider how to wash their\r\nhands and to evade the whole matter. Nobody will blame us for anything,\r\nand our fame will be as spotless as the white cloak of the Order.\"\r\n\r\nJust then the voice of old Mikolaj of Dlugolas was heard: \"They suspect\r\nyou of being avaricious and God knows whether justly or no, because even\r\nin this matter, you care more for the profits than the honor of the\r\nOrder.\"\r\n\r\n\"True!\" cried the Mazovian knights in chorus. Then the Teuton advanced a\r\nfew steps, proudly raised his head, and measuring them with a haughty\r\nlook, said:\r\n\r\n\"I do not come here as a messenger, but merely as a witness of the affair\r\nand a knight of the Order who is ready to defend the honor of the Order\r\nwith his own blood to the last gasp! Who, then, in contradiction to\r\nJurand's own words, dares to suspect the Order of having captured his\r\ndaughter--let him raise this knightly pledge and submit to God's\r\njudgment!\"\r\n\r\nHaving said this, he cast before them his knightly glove, which fell upon\r\nthe floor; they again stood in deep silence, because, although more than\r\none of them would have liked to break his weapon on the Teuton's back,\r\nthey all feared God's judgment. Every one knew that Jurand had expressly\r\nstated that the knights of the Order had not captured his child; so they\r\nall thought to themselves, \"It is a just cause; consequently Rotgier will\r\nbe victorious.\"\r\n\r\nHe again became so much the more insolent, and leaning upon his loins,\r\ninquired:\r\n\r\n\"If it is so, who will raise that glove?\"\r\n\r\nJust then, a knight, whose entrance nobody had yet observed, and who for\r\nsome time had listened at the door to the conversation, advanced to the\r\ncentre, raised the gauntlet and said:\r\n\r\n\"I will!\" and so saying, he stared directly into Rotgier's face, and then\r\nbegan to speak with a voice which in that universal silence resounded\r\nlike thunder through the hall:\r\n\r\n\"Before God, before the august prince and all the honorable knighthood of\r\nthis land, I tell you, Teuton, that you bark like a dog against justice\r\nand truth--and I challenge you to a combat on foot, or horseback, with\r\nlance or axe, short or long weapons, and not unto imprisonment but unto\r\nthe last gasp, unto death!\"\r\n\r\nA fly could be heard in the hall. All eyes were turned upon Rotgier and\r\nthe challenging knight, whom nobody recognized, because he had a helmet\r\ncovering his head, although without a steel cap, but with a circular\r\nvisor descending below the ear entirely covering the upper part of the\r\nface, and casting a deep shadow over the lower part. The Teuton was no\r\nless astonished than the rest. Confusion, pallor and raging anger chased\r\neach other over his face, as lightning flashes across a mighty heaven.\r\n\r\nHe caught the gauntlet and attached it to the hook of his armlet, and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Who are you that challenge God's justice?\"\r\n\r\nThe other then unbuckled his gorget, removed the helmet, beneath which\r\nappeared a fair, youthful head, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Zbyszko of Bogdaniec, the husband of Jurand's daughter.\"\r\n\r\nThey were all amazed, and Rotgier, with the others, because none of them,\r\nexcept the prince and his wife, Father Wyszoniek and de Lorche, knew of\r\nDanusia's marriage; the Teutons moreover were confident that Jurand's\r\ndaughter had no other natural defender besides her father; but at that\r\nmoment de Lorche stood up and said:\r\n\r\n\"Upon my knightly honor I vouch for the truthfulness of his words; should\r\nanybody dare to doubt it, here is my guage.\"\r\n\r\nRotgier, who did not know what fear meant, and whose heart swelled with\r\nanger at this moment, would have perhaps accepted even this challenge,\r\nbut remembering that the man who cast it was powerful, and moreover a\r\nrelative of Duke Geldryi, he refrained, and the more readily, because the\r\nprince himself arose and, wrinkling his brows, said:\r\n\r\n\"It is forbidden to accept this challenge, because I also declare that\r\nthis knight has told the truth.\"\r\n\r\nThe Teuton, on hearing this, bowed, and then said to Zbyszko:\r\n\r\n\"If you wish it, then on foot, in closed lists with axes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have already challenged you in all ways,\" replied Zbyszko.\r\n\r\n\"May God give the victory to justice!\" exclaimed the Mazovian knights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nThere was anxiety about Zbyszko in the whole court, among the knights as\r\nwell as among the ladies, because he was universally liked; but,\r\naccording to Jurand's letter, nobody doubted that the right was on the\r\nside of the Teuton. On the other hand it was known that Rotgier was one\r\nof the more famous brethren of the Order. The squire van Krist narrated\r\namong the Mazovian nobility, perhaps on purpose, that his lord before\r\nbecoming an armed monk, once sat at the Honor-Table of the Teutons, to\r\nwhich table only world-famous knights were admitted, those who had\r\naccomplished an expedition to the Holy Land, or fought victoriously\r\nagainst giants, dragons, or mighty magicians. Hearing van Krist tell such\r\ntales, and, at the same time, boast that his lord had repeatedly met five\r\nopponents single-handed with his \"dagger of mercy\" in one hand and an axe\r\nor sword in the other, the Mazurs were disquieted, and some said: \"Oh, if\r\nonly Jurand were here, he could give an account of himself with even two;\r\nno German ever escaped him yet, but the youth--bah!--for the other\r\nexceeds him in strength, years and experience.\"\r\n\r\nTherefore others regretted that they had not accepted the challenge,\r\nasserting that they would undoubtedly have done so, if it had not been\r\nfor the news from Jurand. \"But fear of the judgment of God....\" On this\r\noccasion, and for mutual entertainment, they recalled the names of\r\nMazovian and more often of Polish knights, who, either in courtly jousts\r\nor hunting, had gained numerous victories over the western knights; above\r\nall they mentioned Zawisza of Garbow, with whom no knight of the\r\nChristian kingdom could cope. But there were also those who cherished\r\ngreat hopes of Zbyszko: \"He is not to be despised!\" they said \"and\r\naccording to common report he once admirably broke the heads of Germans\r\nin fair field.\" But their hearts were particularly strengthened by the\r\naction of Zbyszko's follower, the Bohemian Hlawa, who, on the eve of the\r\ncombat, hearing how van Krist was talking about Rotgier's unheard-of\r\nvictories, and being a hasty youth, caught van Krist by the beard, pulled\r\nhis head up, and said:\r\n\r\n\"If it is no shame to lie before men, then look up, so that God also may\r\nhear you!\"\r\n\r\nAnd he kept him long enough to say a \"Pater\"; while the other, when at\r\nlength liberated, began to ask him about his lineage, and, having heard\r\nthat he sprang from the _wlodykas_, challenged him also to fight with\r\naxes.\r\n\r\nThe Mazovians were delighted at such conduct, and again several said:\r\n\r\n\"Indeed these fellows will not hobble on the barn-floor; even if truth\r\nand God be on their side these Teutonic women will not carry away sound\r\nbones with them!\"\r\n\r\nBut Rotgier succeeded in throwing dust in the eyes of all, so that many\r\nwere disquieted as to which had the truth on his side, and the prince\r\nhimself partook of that fear.\r\n\r\nTherefore, on the evening before the combat, he summoned Zbyszko to a\r\nconsultation at which was present the princess only, and asked:\r\n\r\n\"Are you positive that God will be with you? How do you know that they\r\ncaptured Danusia? Did Jurand perchance tell you any thing? Because, you\r\nsee, here is Jurand's letter, by the hand of the priest Kaleb, and his\r\nseal, and in this letter Jurand says that he knows that it was not the\r\nTeutons. What did he tell you?\"\r\n\r\n\"He said that it was not the Teutons.\"\r\n\r\n\"How then can you risk your life and appeal to the judgment of God?\"\r\n\r\nThen Zbyszko was silent, and only his jaws worked for some time and tears\r\ngathered in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I know nothing, gracious lord,\" he said. \"We left here together with\r\nJurand, and on the way I admitted our marriage. He then began to lament\r\nthat this might be a sin against God, but when I told him it was God's\r\nwill, he quieted down and forgave me. Along the whole way he said that\r\nnobody captured Danusia but the Teutons, and what happened afterward I do\r\nnot know myself! That woman who brought certain medicines for me to the\r\nForest Court, came to Spychow, accompanied by another messenger. They\r\nshut themselves up with Jurand and deliberated. Neither do I know what\r\nthey said, only after the interview his own servants could not recognize\r\nJurand, because he looked as if he had risen from the grave. He told us:\r\n'Not the Teutons,' but he released von Bergow and all the prisoners he\r\nhad underground, God knows why! he himself again rode away without any\r\nwarrior or servant.... He said that he was riding after robbers to ransom\r\nDanusia, and ordered me to wait. And I waited until the news from\r\nSzczytno arrived, that Jurand had slain Germans and fallen himself. Oh!\r\ngracious lord! The soil in Spychow almost scorched me and I nearly ran\r\nmad. I made people mount horses in order to revenge Jurand's death, and\r\nthen the priest Kaleb said: 'You will not be able to take the castle, and\r\ndo not commence war. Go to the prince, perhaps they know something about\r\nDanusia there.' Hlawa and I arrived, and just heard how that dog was\r\nbarking about Teutonic grievances and Jurand's frenzy.... My lord, I\r\naccepted his challenge, because I had challenged him before, and although\r\nI know nothing, this much I know, that they are hellish liars--without\r\nshame, without honor and without belief! Look, gracious lord, they\r\nstabbed de Fourcy to death and tried to cast the guilt upon my follower!\r\nBy God! they stabbed him like an ox, and then they came to you, lord, for\r\nvengeance and retribution! Who will swear then, that they did not lie to\r\nJurand before, and now do the same to you, lord?... I know not, I know\r\nnot where Danusia is but I challenged him, because, even if I were to\r\nlose my life, I prefer death to life without my love, without the one who\r\nis clearest to me in the whole world.\"\r\n\r\nSaying this in rapture, he tore off a band from his head, so that his\r\nhair fell about his shoulders, and clutching it, he began to weep\r\nbitterly, until the princess Anna Danuta was moved to the bottom of her\r\nsoul for the loss of Danusia, and, pitying him for his sufferings, laid\r\nher hands upon his head, and said:\r\n\r\n\"May God help you, console and bless you!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nThe prince did not object to the duel, because, according to the customs\r\nof that time, he had no power to do so. He only prevailed upon Rotgier to\r\nwrite a letter to the master and to Zygfried von Löve, stating that he\r\nwas the first to throw down the gauntlet to the Mazovian knights, in\r\nconsequence of which he appeared at a combat with the husband of Jurand's\r\ndaughter, who had already challenged him once before.\r\n\r\nThe Teuton also explained to the grand master, that if he appeared at the\r\nduel without permission, he did it for the sake of the honor of the\r\nOrder, and to avert ugly suspicions, which might entail disgrace, and\r\nwhich he, Rotgier, was always prepared to redeem with his own blood. This\r\nletter was sent instantly to the border by one of the knight's footmen,\r\nto be sent thence to Malborg by mail, which the Teutons, some years\r\nbefore others, invented and introduced into their possessions.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the snow in the courtyard was leveled and strewn with ashes, so\r\nthat the feet of the fighters should neither clog nor slip upon the\r\nsmooth surface. There was unusual excitement in the whole castle.\r\n\r\nThe knights and court ladies were so agitated that on the night preceding\r\nthe fight nobody slept. They said, that a fight on horseback with spears,\r\nand even with swords, frequently terminates in wounds; on foot on the\r\ncontrary, and particularly with terrible axes, it always terminates in\r\ndeath. All hearts were with Zbyszko, but the very ones who felt most\r\nfriendly toward him or Danusia recollected with so much more fear the\r\nstories about the fame and dexterity of the Teuton. Many ladies spent the\r\nnight in church, where also Zbyszko confessed to the priest Wyszoniek,\r\nThey said one to another as they looked at his almost boyish face: \"Why,\r\nhe is a child yet! how can he expose his head to the German axe?\" And\r\nthey prayed the more fervently for aid for him. But when he arose at\r\ndaybreak and walked through the chapel, in order to put on his arms in\r\nthe hall, they again gained courage, because, although Zbyszko's features\r\nwere indeed boyish, his body was of an extraordinary size, and strong, so\r\nthat he seemed to them to be a picked man, who could take care of himself\r\nagainst even the most powerful.\r\n\r\nThe fight was to take place in the castle yard, which was surrounded by a\r\nporch. When it was broad daylight, the prince and princess arrived\r\ntogether with their children and took their seats in the centre between\r\nthe pillars, from where the whole yard could best be overlooked. Next to\r\nthem were the principal courtiers, noble ladies, and the knighthood. All\r\nthe corners of the vestibule were filled: the domestics gathered behind\r\nthe wall which was made from the swept snow, some clung to the posts, and\r\neven to the roof. There the vulgar muttered among themselves: \"God grant\r\nthat our champion may not be subdued!\"\r\n\r\nThe day was cold, moist, but clear; the sky swarmed with daws, which\r\ninhabited the roofs and summits of the bastions, and which, scared by the\r\nunusual bustle, moved in circles, with great clapping of wings, over the\r\ncastle. Notwithstanding the cold, the people perspired with excitement,\r\nand when the first horn sounded to announce the entrance of the\r\ncombatants, all hearts began to beat like hammers.\r\n\r\nThey entered from opposite sides of the arena and halted at the barriers.\r\nEvery one of the onlookers then held his breath, every one thought, that\r\nvery soon two souls would escape to the threshold of the Divine Court and\r\ntwo dead bodies remain on the snow, and the lips, as well as the cheeks\r\nof the women turned pale and livid at that thought; the eyes of the men\r\nagain gazed steadfastly at the opponents as at a rainbow, because every\r\none was trying to forecast, from their postures and armament alone, which\r\nside would be victorious.\r\n\r\nThe Teuton was dressed in an enameled blue cuirass, with similar armor\r\nfor the thighs, as also the helmet with raised visor, and with a\r\nmagnificent bunch of peacock feathers on the crest. Zbyszko's breast,\r\nsides and back were encased in splendid Milanese mail, which he had once\r\ncaptured from the Fryzjans. He had on his head a helmet with an open\r\nvisor, and without feathers; on his legs was bull's hide. On their left\r\nshoulders, they carried shields with coat of arms; on the Teuton's at the\r\ntop was a chessboard, at the bottom, three lions rampant; on Zbyszko's, a\r\nblunt horseshoe. In the right hand they carried broad, huge, terrible\r\naxes, set in oaken, blackened helves, longer than the arm of a grown man.\r\nThe warriors who seconded them were: Hlawa, called by Zbyszko, Glowacz,\r\nand van Krist, both dressed in dark iron mail, both equally with axes and\r\nshields: van Krist had on his shield a St. John's wort; the shield of the\r\nBohemian resembled that of the _Pomian_, with this difference, that\r\ninstead of an axe stuck in a bull's head, it had a short weapon half sunk\r\nin the eye.\r\n\r\nThe horn sounded the second time, and, at the third, the opponents,\r\naccording to agreement, were to advance against each other. A small space\r\nstrewn with grey ashes now only separated them; over that space hovered\r\nin the air like an ominous bird--death. But before the third signal was\r\ngiven, Rotgier approached the pillars between which sat the prince's\r\nfamily, raised his steel-encased head, and began to speak in such a loud\r\nvoice that he was heard in all corners of the vestibule:\r\n\r\n\"I take God, you, worthy lord, and the whole knighthood of this soil, as\r\nwitness that I am not guilty of the blood that is about to be shed.\"\r\n\r\nAt these words their hearts were again ready to break with grief, seeing\r\nthat the Teuton was so confident of himself and his victory. But Zbyszko,\r\nhaving a simple soul, turned to his Bohemian, and said:\r\n\r\n\"That Teutonic boasting stinks; it would be more appropriate after my\r\ndeath than while I am alive. That boaster moreover has a peacock's plume\r\non his helmet, and at the very outset I made a vow to obtain three of\r\nthem and afterward as many fingers of the hand. God grant it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Lord ...\" said the Bohemian, bending down and picking up in his hands\r\nsome ashes from the snow, to prevent the axe-handle from slipping in his\r\nhand; \"perhaps Christ will permit me quickly to despatch that vile\r\nPrussian, and then perhaps, if not to defeat this Teuton, at least put\r\nthe handle of the axe between his knees and upset him.\"\r\n\r\n\"God save you!\" hastily exclaimed Zbyszko; \"you would cover me and\r\nyourself with disgrace.\"\r\n\r\nBut at that moment the horn sounded the third time. On hearing it, the\r\nseconds sprang quickly and furiously at each other, while the knights\r\nmoved slowly and deliberately, as their dignity and gravity demanded, for\r\nthe first bout.\r\n\r\nVery few paid attention to the seconds, but those of the experienced men\r\nand of the domestics who looked at them understood at once how great were\r\nthe odds on Hlawa's side. The German wielded the heavier axe and his\r\nshield was cumbersome. Below the shield were visible his legs which were\r\nlonger, though not so strong nor active as the sturdy and tightly covered\r\nlegs of the Bohemian.\r\n\r\nHlawa moreover pressed so vigorously that van Krist, almost from the\r\nfirst moment, was compelled to retreat. It was instantly understood that\r\none of the adversaries would fall upon the other like a tempest; that he\r\nwould attack and strike like lightning, while the other, under the\r\nconviction that death was already upon him, would merely defend himself\r\nso as to postpone the terrible moment as long as possible.\r\n\r\nAnd so it actually was. That boaster, who generally stood up to fight\r\nonly when he could not do otherwise, now recognized that his insolent and\r\nheedless words had led him into a fight with a terrible giant whom he\r\nought to have avoided like a perdition; and so, when he now felt that\r\nevery one of these blows could kill an ox, his heart began to fail\r\nentirely. He almost forgot that it is not sufficient to catch the blows\r\non the shield, but that it was also necessary to return them. He saw\r\nabove him the lightning of the axe and thought that every gleam was the\r\nlast. Holding up the shield, he involuntarily half closed his eyes with a\r\nfeeling of terror and doubt whether he would ever open them again. Very\r\nrarely he gave a blow himself, but without any hope of reaching his\r\nopponent, and raised the shield constantly higher over his head, so as to\r\nsave it yet for a little.\r\n\r\nFinally he began to tire, but the Bohemian struck on constantly more\r\npowerfully. Just as from a tall pine-tree great chips fly under the\r\npeasant's axe, so under the Bohemian's strokes fragments began to scale\r\noff and fly from the German warrior's armor. The upper edge of the shield\r\nwas bent and shattered, the mail from the right shoulder rolled to the\r\nground, together with the cut and already bloody strap of leather. This\r\nmade van Krist's hair stand on end--and a deadly fear seized him. He\r\nstruck with all the force of his arm once and again at the Bohemian's\r\nshield; finally, seeing that he had no chance against his adversary's\r\nterrible strength and that only some extraordinary exertion could save\r\nhim, he threw himself suddenly with all the weight of his armor and body\r\nagainst Hlawa's legs. Both fell to the ground and tried to overcome each\r\nother, rolling and struggling in the snow. But the Bohemian soon appeared\r\non top; for a moment he still checked the desperate efforts of his\r\nopponent; finally he pressed his knee upon the chain-armor covering his\r\nbelly, and took from the back of his belt a short three-edged \"dagger of\r\nmercy.\"[109]\r\n\r\n\"Spare me!\" faintly gasped van Krist, raising his eyes toward those of\r\nthe Bohemian.\r\n\r\nBut the latter, instead of answering, stretched himself upon him the\r\neasier to reach his neck, and, cutting through the leather fastening of\r\nthe helmet under the chin, stabbed the unfortunate man twice in the\r\nthroat, directing the sharp edge downward toward the centre of the\r\nbreast.\r\n\r\nThen van Krist's pupils sank in their sockets, his hands and legs began\r\nto beat the snow, as if trying to clean it of the ashes, but after a\r\nmoment he stiffened out and lay motionless, breathing only with red,\r\nfoam-covered lips, and bleeding profusely.\r\n\r\nBut the Bohemian arose, wiped the \"dagger of mercy\" on the German's\r\nclothing, then raised the axe, and, leaning against it, he began to look\r\nat the harder and more stubborn fight between his knight and Brother\r\nRotgier.\r\n\r\nThe western knights were already accustomed to comforts and luxuries,\r\nwhile the landowners in Little Poland and Great Poland, as also in\r\nMazowsze, led a rigorous and hardy life, wherefore they awoke admiration\r\nby their bodily strength and endurance of all hardships, whether constant\r\nor occasional, even among strangers and foes. Now also it was\r\ndemonstrated that Zbyszko was as superior to the Teuton in bodily\r\nstrength as his squire was superior to van Krist, but it was also proven\r\nthat his youth rendered him the inferior in knightly training.\r\n\r\nIt was in some measure favorable for Zbyszko that he had chosen a combat\r\nwith axes, because fencing with that kind of weapon was impossible. With\r\nlong and short swords, with which it was necessary to know the strokes,\r\nthrusts, and how to ward off blows, the German would have had a\r\nconsiderable superiority. But even so, Zbyszko, as well as the\r\nspectators, recognized from his motions and management of the shield,\r\nthat they had before them an experienced and formidable man, who\r\napparently was not entering a combat of this kind for the first time. To\r\neach of Zbyszko's blows Rotgier offered his shield, slightly withdrawing\r\nit at the concussion, by which means even the most powerful swing lost\r\nits force, and could neither cleave nor crush the smooth surface. He at\r\ntimes retreated and at times became aggressive, doing it quietly, though\r\nso quickly that the eyes could hardly follow his motions.\r\n\r\nThe prince was seized with fear for Zbyszko, and the faces of the men\r\nlooked gloomy; it seemed that the German was purposely trifling with his\r\nopponent. Sometimes he did not even interpose the shield, but at the\r\nmoment when Zbyszko struck, he turned half aside, so that the sharp edge\r\nof the axe cut the empty air. This was the most terrifying thing, because\r\nZbyszko might thereby lose his balance and fall, and then his destruction\r\nwould be inevitable. Seeing this, the Bohemian, standing over the slain\r\nvan Krist, also became alarmed, and said to himself: \"My God! if my\r\nmaster falls, I will strike him with the hook of my axe between the\r\nshoulder-blades, and overthrow him also.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, Zbyszko did not fall, because, being very strong upon his legs\r\nand separating them widely, he was able to support the entire weight of\r\nhis body on either as he swung.\r\n\r\nRotgier observed that instantly, and the onlookers were mistaken in\r\nsupposing that he underestimated his opponent. On the contrary, after the\r\nfirst strokes, when, in spite of his utmost skill in withdrawing the\r\nshield, his hand almost stiffened under it, he understood that he would\r\nhave a hard time with this youth, and that, if he did not knock him down\r\nby some clever manoeuvre, the combat would prove long and dangerous. He\r\nexpected Zbyszko to fall upon the snow after a vain stroke in the air,\r\nand as that did not happen, he immediately became uneasy. He saw, beneath\r\nthe steel visor, the closely-drawn nostrils and mouth of his opponent,\r\nand occasionally his gleaming eyes, and he said to himself that the other\r\nwould fly into a blind rage and forget himself, lose his head, and madly\r\nthink more of striking than of defending himself. But he was mistaken in\r\nthis also. Zbyszko did not know how to avoid a stroke by a half-turn, but\r\nhe did not forget his shield, and, while raising the axe, did not expose\r\nhimself more than was necessary. His attention was apparently redoubled,\r\nand having recognized the experience and skill of his opponent, instead\r\nof forgetting himself he collected his thoughts and became more cautious;\r\nand there was that premeditation in his blows which not hot but cool\r\nanger only can conquer.\r\n\r\nRotgier, who had fought in many wars and battles, either in troop or\r\nsingly, knew by experience that there are some people, like birds of\r\nprey, who are born to fight, being specially gifted by Nature, who\r\nbestows all things, with what others only attain after years of training,\r\nand he at the same time observed that he was now dealing with one of\r\nthose. He understood from the very first strokes that there was in this\r\nyouth something as in a hawk, who sees in his opponent only his prey, and\r\nthinks of nothing but getting him in his claws. Notwithstanding his own\r\nstrength, he also noticed that it was not equal to Zbyszko's, and should\r\nhe get exhausted before succeeding in giving a final stroke, the combat\r\nwith this formidable, although less experienced, stripling, might result\r\nin his ruin. Thus reflecting, he determined to fight with the least\r\npossible effort, drew the shield closer to him, did not move much either\r\nforward or backward, restricted his motions, and gathered all the power\r\nof his soul and arm for one decisive stroke, and awaited his opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe terrible fight lasted longer than usual. A deathlike silence reigned\r\nin the porches. The only sounds heard were the sometimes ringing and\r\nsometimes hollow blows of the sharp points and edges of the axes against\r\nthe shields. Such sights were not strange to the princes, knights and\r\ncourtiers; and nevertheless a feeling, resembling terror, seemed to\r\nclutch all hearts as if with tongs. It was understood that this was not a\r\nmere exhibition of strength, skill and courage, but that in this fight\r\nthere was a greater fury and despair, a greater and more inexorable\r\nstubbornness, a deeper vengeance. On one side terrible wrongs, love and\r\nfathomless sorrow; on the other, the honor of the entire Order and deep\r\nhatred, met on this field of battle for the Judgment of God.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the wintry, pale morning brightened, the grey fog cleared away,\r\nand the sunrays shone upon the blue cuirass of the Teuton and the silver\r\nMilanese armor of Zbyszko. The bell rang in the chapel for early mass,\r\nand at the sounds of the bell flights of crows again flew from the castle\r\nroofs, flapping their wings and crowing noisily, as if in joy at the\r\nsight of blood and the corpse lying motionless in the snow. Rotgier\r\nlooked at it once and again during the fight, and suddenly began to feel\r\nvery lonesome. All the eyes that were turned upon him were those of\r\nenemies. All the prayers, wishes and silent vows which the women were\r\noffering were in Zbyszko's favor. Moreover, although the Teuton was fully\r\nconvinced that the squire would not cast himself upon him from behind,\r\nnor strike him treacherously, nevertheless, the presence and nearness of\r\nthat terrifying figure involuntarily inspired him with such fear as\r\npeople are subject to at the sight of a wolf, a bear or a buffalo, from\r\nwhich they are not separated by bars. And he could not shake off this\r\nfeeling, especially as the Bohemian, in his desire to follow closely the\r\ncourse of the battle, constantly changed his place, stepping in between\r\nthe fighters from the side, from behind, from the front--bending his head\r\nat the same time, and looking at him fiercely through the visor of the\r\nhelmet, and sometimes slightly raising his bloody weapon, as if\r\ninvoluntarily.\r\n\r\nAt last the Teuton began to tire. One after another, he gave two blows,\r\nshort but terrible, directing them at Zbyszko's right arm, but they were\r\nmet by the shield with such force that the axe trembled in Rotgier's\r\nhand, and he himself was compelled to retreat suddenly to save himself\r\nfrom falling; and from that moment, he retreated steadily. Finally, not\r\nonly his strength but also his coolness and patience began to be\r\nexhausted. At the sight of his retreating, a few triumphant shouts\r\nescaped from the breasts of the spectators, awakening in him anger and\r\ndespair. The strokes of the axes became more frequent. Perspiration\r\nflowed from the brows of both fighters, and panting breath escaped from\r\ntheir breasts through their clenched teeth. The spectators ceased keeping\r\nsilence, and now every moment voices, male or female, cried: \"Strike! At\r\nhim!... God's judgment! God's punishment! God help you!\"\r\n\r\nThe prince motioned with his hand several times to silence them, but he\r\ncould not restrain them! Every moment the noise increased, because\r\nchildren here and there began to cry on the porches, and finally, at the\r\nvery side of the princess, a youthful, sobbing, female voice called out:\r\n\r\n\"For Danusia, Zbyszko! for Danusia!\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko knew well that it was for Danusia's sake. He was sure that this\r\nTeuton had assisted in her capture, and in fighting him, he fought for\r\nher wrongs. But being young and eager for battles, during the combat he\r\nhad thought of that only. But suddenly, that cry brought back to his mind\r\nher loss and her sufferings. Love, sorrow and vengeance poured fire into\r\nhis veins. His heart began to call out with suddenly awakened pain, and\r\nhe was plainly seized with a fighting frenzy. The Teuton could not any\r\nlonger catch nor avoid the terrible strokes, resembling thunderbolts.\r\nZbyszko struck his shield against his with such superhuman force, that\r\nthe German's arm stiffened suddenly and fell.... He retreated in terror\r\nand half crouched, but that instant there flashed in his eyes the gleam\r\nof the axe, and the sharp edge fell like a thunderbolt upon his right\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\nOnly a rending cry reached the ears of the onlookers: \"Jesus!\"--then\r\nRotgier retreated one more step and fell upon his back on the ground.\r\nImmediately there was a noise and buzz on the porches, as in a bee-garden\r\nin which the bees, warmed by the sun, commence to move and swarm. The\r\nknights ran down the stairs in whole throngs, the servants jumped over\r\nthe snow-walls, to take a look at the corpses. Everywhere resounded the\r\nshouts: \"This is God's judgment ... Jurand has an heir! Glory to him and\r\nthanksgiving! This is a man for the axe!\" Others again cried: \"Look and\r\nmarvel! Jurand himself could not strike more nobly.\" A whole group of\r\ncurious ones stood around Rotgier's corpse, and he lay on his back with a\r\nface as white as snow, with gaping mouth and with a bloody arm so\r\nterribly shorn from the neck down to the armpit, that it scarcely held by\r\na few shreds.\r\n\r\nTherefore, others again said: \"He was alive just now and walked upon the\r\nearth with arrogance, but now he cannot even move a finger.\" And thus\r\nspeaking, some admired his stature, because he took up a large space on\r\nthe battlefield, and appeared even larger in death; others again admired\r\nhis peacock plume, changing colors beautifully in the snow; others again\r\nhis armor, which was valued at a good village. But the Bohemian, Hlawa,\r\nnow approached with two of Zbyszko's retainers in order to take it off\r\nfrom the deceased, therefore the curious surrounded Zbyszko, praising and\r\nextolling him to the skies, because they justly thought that his fame\r\nwould redound to the credit of the whole Mazovian and Polish knighthood.\r\nMeanwhile the shield and axe were taken from him, to lighten his burden,\r\nand Mrokota of Mocarzew unbuckled his helmet and covered his hair, wet\r\nwith perspiration, with a cap of scarlet cloth.\r\n\r\nZbyszko stood, as if petrified, breathing heavily, with the fire not\r\nfully extinguished yet in his eyes, and a face pale with exhaustion and\r\ndetermination and trembling somewhat with excitement and fatigue. But he\r\nwas taken by the hand and led to the princely family, who were waiting\r\nfor him in a warm room, by the fireside. There Zbyszko kneeled down\r\nbefore them and when Father Wyszoniek gave him a blessing and said a\r\nprayer for the eternal rest of the souls of the dead, the prince embraced\r\nthe young knight and said:\r\n\r\n\"God Almighty decided between you two and guided your hand, for which His\r\nname be blessed. Amen!\"\r\n\r\nThen turning to the knight de Lorche and others, he added:\r\n\r\n\"You, foreign knight and all present I take as witnesses to what I\r\ntestify myself, that they met according to law and custom, and as the\r\n'Judgment of God' is everywhere performed, this also was conducted in a\r\nknightly and devout manner.\"\r\n\r\nThe local warriors cried out affirmatively in chorus; when again the\r\nprince's words were translated to de Lorche, he arose and announced that\r\nhe not only testified that all was conducted in knightly and devout\r\nstyle, but should anybody in Malborg or any other princely court dare to\r\nquestion it, he, de Lorche, would challenge him instantly to fight either\r\non foot or horseback, even if he should not merely be a common knight,\r\nbut a giant or wizard, exceeding even Merlin's magical power.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the princess Anna Danuta, at the moment when Zbyszko embraced\r\nher knees, said as she bent down to him:\r\n\r\n\"Why do you not feel happy? Be happy and thank God, because if He in His\r\nmercy has granted you this suit, then He will not leave you in the\r\nfuture, and will lead you to happiness.\"\r\n\r\nBut Zbyszko replied:\r\n\r\n\"How can I be happy, gracious lady? God gave me victory and vengeance\r\nover that Teuton, but Danusia was not and still is not here, and I am no\r\nnearer to her now than I was before.\"\r\n\r\n\"The most stubborn foes, Danveld, Godfried and Rotgier live no longer,\"\r\nreplied the princess, \"and they say that Zygfried is more just than they,\r\nalthough cruel. Praise God's mercy at least for that. Also de Lorche said\r\nthat if the Teuton fell he would carry his body away, and go instantly to\r\nMalborg and demand Danusia from the grand master himself. They will\r\ncertainly not dare to disobey the grand master.\"\r\n\r\n\"May God give health to de Lorche,\" said Zbyszko, \"and I will go with him\r\nto Malborg.\"\r\n\r\nBut these words frightened the princess, who felt it was as if Zbyszko\r\nsaid he would go unarmed among the wolves that assembled in the winter in\r\npacks in the deep Mazovian forests.\r\n\r\n\"What for?\" she exclaimed. \"For sure destruction? On your arrival,\r\nneither de Lorche nor those letters, written by Rotgier before the fight,\r\nwill help you. You will save nobody and only ruin yourself.\"\r\n\r\nBut he arose, crossed his hands and said: \"So may God help me, that I\r\nshall go to Malborg and even across oceans. So may Christ bless me, that\r\nI shall look for her until the last breath of my nostrils, and that I\r\nshall not cease until I perish. It is easier for me to fight the Germans,\r\nand meet them in arms, than for this orphan to moan under ground. Oh,\r\neasier! easier!\"\r\n\r\nAnd he said that, as always when he mentioned Danusia, with such rapture,\r\nwith such pain, that his words broke off as if some one had clutched him\r\nby the throat.\r\n\r\nThe princess recognized that it would be useless to turn him aside, and\r\nthat if anybody wanted to detain him it must be by chaining him and\r\ncasting him under ground.\r\n\r\nBut Zbyszko could not leave at once. Knights of that day were not allowed\r\nto heed any obstacles, but he was not permitted to break the knightly\r\ncustom that required the winner in a duel to spend a whole day on the\r\nfield of combat, until the following midnight, and this in order to show\r\nthat he remained master of the field of battle and to show his readiness\r\nfor another fight, should any of the relatives or friends of the defeated\r\nwish to challenge him to such.\r\n\r\nThis custom was even observed by whole armies, which thus sometimes lost\r\nadvantages which might accrue from haste after the victory. Zbyszko did\r\nnot even attempt to evade that inexorable law, and refreshing himself,\r\nand afterward putting on his armor, he lingered until midnight in the\r\ncastle yard, under the clouded wintry sky, awaiting the foe that could\r\nnot come from anywhere.\r\n\r\nAt midnight, when the heralds finally announced his victory by sound of\r\ntrumpet, Mikolaj of Dlugolas invited him to supper and at the same time\r\nto a council with the prince.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nThe prince was the first to take the floor at the consultation and spoke\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\"It is bad that we have no writing nor testimony against the counts.\r\nAlthough our suspicions may be justified, and I myself think that they\r\nand nobody else captured Jurand's daughter, still what of it? They will\r\ndeny it. And if the grand master asks for proofs, what shall I show him?\r\nBah! even Jurand's letter speaks in their favor.\"\r\n\r\nHere he turned to Zbyszko:\r\n\r\n\"You say that they forced this letter from him with threats. It is\r\npossible, and undoubtedly it is so, because if justice were on their\r\nside, God would not have helped you against Rotgier. But since they\r\nextorted one, then they could extort also two. And perhaps they have\r\nevidence from Jurand, that they are not guilty of the capture of this\r\nunfortunate girl. And if so, they will show it to the master and what\r\nwill happen then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, they admitted themselves, gracious lord, that they recaptured her\r\nfrom bandits and that she is with them now.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know that. But they say now that they were mistaken, and that this is\r\nanother girl, and the best proof is that Jurand himself disclaimed her.\"\r\n\r\n\"He disclaimed her because they showed him another girl, and that is what\r\nexasperated him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely it was so, but they can say that these are only our ideas.\"\r\n\r\n\"Their lies,\" said Mikolaj of Dlugolas, \"are like a pine forest. From the\r\nedge a little way is visible, but the deeper one goes the greater is the\r\ndensity, so that a man goes astray and loses his way entirely.\"\r\n\r\nHe then repeated his words in German to de Lorche, who said:\r\n\r\n\"The grand master himself is better than they are, also his brother,\r\nalthough he has a daring soul, but it guards knightly honor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Mikolaj. \"The master is humane. He cannot restrain the\r\ncounts, nor the assembly, and it is not his fault that everything in the\r\nOrder is based upon human wrongs, but he cannot help it. Go, go, Sir de\r\nLorche, and tell him what has happened here. They are more ashamed before\r\nstrangers than before us, lest they should tell of their outrages and\r\ndishonest actions at foreign courts. And should the master ask for\r\nproofs, then tell him this: 'To know the truth is divine, to seek it is\r\nhuman, therefore if you wish proofs, lord, then seek them.' Order the\r\ncastles to be summoned and the people to be questioned, allow us to\r\nsearch, because it is foolishness and a lie that this orphan was stolen\r\nby bandits of the woods.\"\r\n\r\n\"Folly and lies!\" repeated de Lorche.\r\n\r\n\"Because bandits would not dare to attack the princely court, nor\r\nJurand's child. And even if they should have captured her, it would be\r\nonly for ransom, and they alone would inform us that they had her.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall narrate all that,\" said the Lotaringen, \"and also find von\r\nBergow. We are from the same country, and although I don't know him, they\r\nsay that he is a relative of Duke Geldryi's. He was at Szczytno and\r\nshould tell the master what he saw.\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko understood a few of his words, and whatever he did not, Mikolaj\r\nexplained to him; he then embraced de Lorche so tightly that the knight\r\nalmost groaned.\r\n\r\nThe prince again said to Zbyszko:\r\n\r\n\"And are you also absolutely determined to go?\"\r\n\r\n\"Absolutely, gracious lord. What else am I to do? I vowed to seize\r\nSzczytno, even if I had to bite the walls with my teeth, but how can I\r\ndeclare war without permission?\"\r\n\r\n\"Whoever began war without permission, would rue it under the\r\nexecutioner's sword,\" said the prince.\r\n\r\n\"It is certainly the law of laws,\" replied Zbyszko. \"Bah! I wished then\r\nto challenge all who were in Szczytno, but people said that Jurand\r\nslaughtered them like cattle, and I did not know who was alive and who\r\ndead.... Because, may God and the Holy Cross help me, I will not desert\r\nJurand till the last moment!\"\r\n\r\n\"You speak nobly and worthily,\" said Mikolaj of Dlugolas. \"And it proves\r\nthat you were sensible not to go alone to Szczytno, because even a fool\r\nwould have known that they would keep neither Jurand nor his daughter\r\nthere, but undoubtedly would carry them away to some other castle. God\r\nrewarded your arrival here with Rotgier.\"\r\n\r\n\"And now!\" said the prince, \"as we heard from Rotgier, of those four only\r\nold Zygfried is alive, and the others God has punished already either by\r\nyour hand or Jurand's. As for Zygfried, he is less of a rascal than the\r\nothers, but perhaps the more ruthless tyrant. It is bad that Jurand and\r\nDanusia are in his power, and they must be saved quickly. In order that\r\nno accident may happen to you, I will give you a letter to the grand\r\nmaster. Listen and understand me well, that you do not go as a messenger,\r\nbut as a delegate, and write to the master as follows: Since they had\r\nonce made an attempt upon our person, in carrying off a descendant of\r\ntheir benefactors, it is most likely now, that they have also carried off\r\nJurand's daughter, especially having a grudge against Jurand. I ask\r\ntherefore of the master to order a diligent search, and if he is anxious\r\nto have my friendship, to restore her instantly to your hands.\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko, hearing this, fell at the prince's feet, and, embracing them,\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"But Jurand, gracious lord, Jurand? Will you intercede also in his\r\nbehalf! If he has mortal wounds, let him at least die in his own home and\r\nwith his children.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is also mention made of Jurand,\" said the prince, kindly. \"He is\r\nto appoint two judges and I two also to investigate the counts' and\r\nJurand's actions, according to the rules of knightly honor. And they\r\nagain will select a fifth to preside over them, and it will be as they\r\ndecide.\"\r\n\r\nWith this, the council terminated, after which Zbyszko took leave of the\r\nprince, because they were soon to start on their journey. But before\r\ntheir departure, Mikolaj of Dlugolas, who had experience and knew the\r\nTeutons well, called Zbyszko aside and inquired:\r\n\r\n\"And will you take that Bohemian fellow along with you to the Germans?\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely, he will not leave me. But why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I feel sorry for him. He is a worthy fellow, but mark what I\r\nsay: you will return from Malborg safe and sound, unless you meet a\r\nbetter man in combat, but his destruction is sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because the dog-brothers accused him of having stabbed de Fourcy to\r\ndeath. They must have informed the master of his death, and they\r\ndoubtless said that the Bohemian shed his blood. They will not forgive\r\nthat in Malborg. A trial and vengeance await him because, how can his\r\ninnocence be proven to the master. Why, he even crushed Danveld's arm,\r\nwho is a relative of the grand master. I am sorry for him, I repeat, if\r\nhe goes it is to his death.\"\r\n\r\n\"He will not go to his death, because I shall leave him in Spychow.\"\r\n\r\nBut it happened otherwise, as reasons arose whereby the Bohemian did not\r\nremain in Spychow. Zbyszko and de Lorche started with their suites the\r\nfollowing morning. De Lorche, whose marriage to Ulryka von Elner, Father\r\nWyszoniek dissolved, rode away happy and, with his mind entirely occupied\r\nwith the comeliness of Jagienka of Dlugolas, was silent. Zbyszko, not\r\nbeing able to talk with him about Danusia also, because they could not\r\nunderstand each other very well, conversed with Hlawa, who until now had\r\nknown nothing about the intended expedition into the Teutonic regions.\r\n\r\n\"I am going to Malborg,\" he said, \"but God knows when I shall return....\r\nPerhaps soon, in the spring, in a year, and perhaps not at all, do you\r\nunderstand?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do. Your honor also is surely going to challenge the knights there.\r\nAnd God grant that with every knight there is a shield-bearer!\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Zbyszko. \"I am not going for the purpose of challenging\r\nthem, unless it comes of itself; but you will not go with me at all, but\r\nremain at home in Spychow.\"\r\n\r\nHearing this, the Bohemian at first fretted and began to complain\r\nsorrowfully, and then he begged his young lord not to leave him behind.\r\n\r\n\"I swore that I would not leave you. I swore upon the cross and my honor.\r\nAnd if your honor should meet with an accident, how could I appear before\r\nthe lady in Zgorzelice! I swore to her, lord! Therefore have mercy upon\r\nme, and not disgrace me before her.\"\r\n\r\n\"And did you not swear to her to obey me?\" asked Zbyszko.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly! In everything, but not that I should leave you. If your honor\r\ndrives me away, I shall go ahead, so as to be at hand in case of\r\nnecessity.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not, nor will I drive you away,\" replied Zbyszko; \"but it would be\r\na bondage to me if I could not send you anywhere, even the least way, nor\r\nseparate from you for even one day. You would not stand constantly over\r\nme, like a hangman over a good soul! And as to the combat, how will you\r\nhelp me? I do not speak of war, because these people fight in troops,\r\nand, in a single combat, you certainly will not fight for me. If Rotgier\r\nwere stronger than I, his armor would not lie on my wagon, but mine on\r\nhis. And besides, know that I should have greater difficulties there if\r\nwith you, and that you might expose me to dangers.\"\r\n\r\n\"How so, your honor?\"\r\n\r\nThen Zbyszko began to tell him what he had heard from Mikolaj of\r\nDlugolas, that the counts, not being able to account for de Fourcy's\r\nmurder, would accuse him and prosecute him revengefully.\r\n\r\n\"And if they catch you,\" he said, finally, \"then I certainly cannot leave\r\nyou with them as in dogs' jaws, and may lose my head.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bohemian became gloomy when he heard these words, because he felt the\r\ntruth in them; he nevertheless endeavored to alter the arrangement\r\naccording to his desire.\r\n\r\n\"But those who saw me are not alive any more, because some, as they say,\r\nwere killed by the old lord, while you slew Rotgier.\"\r\n\r\n\"The footmen who followed at a distance saw you, and the old Teuton is\r\nalive, and is surely now in Malborg, and if he is not there yet he will\r\narrive, because the master, with God's permission, will summon him.\"\r\n\r\nHe could not reply to that, they therefore rode on in silence to Spychow.\r\nThey found there complete readiness for war, because old Tolima expected\r\nthat either the Teutons would attack the small castle, or that Zbyszko,\r\non his return, would lead them to the succor of the old lord. Guards were\r\non watch everywhere, on the paths through the marshes and in the castle\r\nitself. The peasants were armed, and, as war was nothing new to them,\r\nthey awaited the Germans with eagerness, promising themselves excellent\r\nbooty.\r\n\r\nFather Kaleb received Zbyszko and de Lorche in the castle, and,\r\nimmediately after supper, showed them the parchment with Jurand's seal,\r\nin which he had written with his own hand the last will of the knight of\r\nSpychow.\r\n\r\n\"He dictated it to me,\" he said, \"the night he went to Szczytno\". And--he\r\ndid not expect to return.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why did you say nothing?\"\r\n\r\n\"I said nothing, because he admitted his intentions to me under the seal\r\nof confession.\"\r\n\r\n\"May God give him eternal peace, and may the light of glory shine upon\r\nhim....\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not say prayers for him. He is still alive. I know it from the Teuton\r\nRotgier, with whom I had a combat at the prince's court. There was God's\r\njudgment between us and I killed him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then Jurand will undoubtedly not return ... unless with God's help!...\"\r\n\r\n\"I go with this knight to tear him from their hands.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you know not, it seems, Teutonic hands, but I know them, because,\r\nbefore Jurand took me to Spychow, I was priest for fifteen years in their\r\ncountry. God alone can save Jurand.\"\r\n\r\n\"And He can help us too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Amen!\"\r\n\r\nHe then unfolded the document and began to read. Jurand bequeathed all\r\nhis estates and his entire possessions to Danusia and her offspring, but,\r\nin case of her death without issue, to her husband Zbyszko of Bogdaniec.\r\nHe finally recommended his will to the prince's care; so that, in case it\r\ncontained anything unlawful, the prince's grace might make it lawful.\r\nThis clause was added because Father Kaleb knew only the canon law, and\r\nJurand himself, engaged exclusively in war, only knew the knightly. After\r\nhaving read the document to Zbyszko, the priest read it to the officers\r\nof the Spychow garrison, who at once recognized the young knight as their\r\nlord, and promised obedience.\r\n\r\nThey also thought that Zbyszko would soon lead them to the assistance of\r\nthe old lord, and they were glad, because their hearts were fierce and\r\nanxious for war, and attached to Jurand. They were seized with grief when\r\nthey heard that they would remain at home, and that the lord with a small\r\nfollowing was going to Malborg, not to fight, but to formulate\r\ncomplaints.\r\n\r\nThe Bohemian Glowacz, shared their grief, although on the other hand, he\r\nwas glad on account of such a large increase of Zbyszko's wealth.\r\n\r\n\"Hej! who would be delighted,\" he said, \"if not the old lord of\r\nBogdaniec! And he could govern here! What is Bogdaniec in comparison with\r\nsuch a possession!\"\r\n\r\nBut Zbyszko was suddenly seized with yearning for his uncle, as it\r\nfrequently happened to him, especially in hard and difficult questions in\r\nlife; therefore, turning to the warrior, he said on the impulse:\r\n\r\n\"Why should you sit here in idleness! Go to Bogdaniec, you shall carry a\r\nletter for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I am not to go with your honor, then I would rather go there!\"\r\nreplied the delighted squire.\r\n\r\n\"Call Father Kaleb to write in a proper manner all that has happened\r\nhere, and the letter will be read to my uncle by the priest of Krzesnia,\r\nor the abbot, if he is in Zgorzelice.\"\r\n\r\nBut as he said this, he struck his moustache with his hand and added, as\r\nif to himself:\r\n\r\n\"Bah! the abbot!...\"\r\n\r\nAnd instantly Jagienka arose before his eyes, blue-eyed, dark-haired,\r\ntall and beautiful, with tears on her eyelashes! He became embarrassed\r\nand rubbed his forehead for a time, but finally he said:\r\n\r\n\"You will feel sad, girl, but not worse than I.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Father Kaleb arrived and immediately began to write. Zbyszko\r\ndictated to him at length everything that had happened from the moment he\r\nhad arrived at the Forest Court. He did not conceal anything, because he\r\nknew that old Macko, when he had a clear view of the matter, would be\r\nglad in the end. Bogdaniec could not be compared with Spychow, which was\r\na large and rich estate, and Zbyszko knew that Macko cared a great deal\r\nfor such things.\r\n\r\nBut when the letter, after great toil, was written and sealed, Zbyszko\r\nagain called his squire, and handed him the letter, saying:\r\n\r\n\"You will perhaps return with my uncle, which would delight me very\r\nmuch.\"\r\n\r\nBut the Bohemian seemed to be embarrassed; he tarried, shifted from one\r\nfoot to another, and did not depart, until the young knight remarked:\r\n\r\n\"Have you anything to say yet, then do so.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should like, your honor ...\" replied the Bohemian, \"I should like to\r\ninquire yet, what to tell the people?\"\r\n\r\n\"Which people?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not those in Bogdaniec, but in the neighborhood.... Because they will\r\nsurely like to find out!\"\r\n\r\nAt that Zbyszko, who determined not to conceal anything, looked at him\r\nsharply and said:\r\n\r\n\"You do not care for the people, but for Jagienka of Zgorzelice.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the Bohemian flushed, and then turned somewhat pale and replied:\r\n\r\n\"For her, lord!\"\r\n\r\n\"And how do you know that she has not got married to Cztan of Rogow, or\r\nto Wilk of Brzozowa?\"\r\n\r\n\"The lady has not got married at all,\" firmly answered the warrior.\r\n\r\n\"The abbot may have ordered her.\"\r\n\r\n\"The abbot obeys the lady, not she him.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you wish then? Tell the truth to her as well as to all.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bohemian bowed and left somewhat angry.\r\n\r\n\"May God grant,\" he said to himself, thinking of Zbyszko, \"that she may\r\nforget you. May God give her a better man than you are. But if she has\r\nnot forgotten you, then I shall tell her that you are married, but\r\nwithout a wife, and that you may become a widower before you have entered\r\nthe bedchamber.\"\r\n\r\nBut the warrior was attached to Zbyszko and pitied Danusia, though he\r\nloved Jagienka above all in this world, and from the time before the last\r\nbattle in Ciechanow, when he had heard of Zbyszko's marriage, he bore\r\npain and bitterness in his heart.\r\n\r\n\"That you may first become a widower!\" he repeated.\r\n\r\nBut then other, and apparently gentler, thoughts began to enter his head,\r\nbecause, while going down to the horses, he said:\r\n\r\n\"God be blessed that I shall at least embrace her feet!\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Zbyszko was impatient to start, because feverishness consumed\r\nhim,--and the affairs of necessity that occupied his attention increased\r\nhis tortures, thinking constantly of Danusia and Jurand. It was\r\nnecessary, however, to remain in Spychow for one night at least, for the\r\nsake of de Lorche, and the preparations which such a long journey\r\nrequired. He was finally utterly worn out from the fight, watch, journey,\r\nsleeplessness and worry. Late in the evening, therefore, he threw himself\r\nupon Jurand's hard bed, in the hope of falling into a short sleep at\r\nleast. But before he fell asleep, Sanderus knocked at his door, entered,\r\nand bowing, said:\r\n\r\n\"Lord, you saved me from death, and I was well off with you, as scarcely\r\never before. God has given you now a large estate, so that you are\r\nwealthier than before, and moreover the Spychow treasury is not empty.\r\nGive me, lord, some kind of a moneybag, and I will go to Prussia, from\r\ncastle to castle, and although it may not be very safe there, I may\r\npossibly do you some service.\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko, who at the first moment had wished to throw him out of the room,\r\nreflected upon his words, and after a moment, pulled from his traveling\r\nbag near his bed, a fair-sized bag, threw it to him and said:\r\n\r\n\"Take it, and go! If you are a rogue you will cheat, if honest--you will\r\nserve.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall cheat as a rogue, sir,\" said Sanderus, \"but not you, and I will\r\nhonestly serve you.\"\r\n\r\nZygfried von Löve was just about to depart for Malborg when the postman\r\nunexpectedly brought him a letter from Rotgier with news from the\r\nMazovian court. This news moved the old Knight of the Cross to the quick.\r\nFirst of all, it was obvious from the letter that Rotgier had perfectly\r\nconducted and represented the Jurand affair before Prince Janusz.\r\nZygfried smiled on reading that Rotgier had further requested the prince\r\nto deliver up Spychow to the Order as a recompense for the wrong done.\r\nBut the other part of the letter contained unexpected and less\r\nadvantageous tidings. Rotgier further informed him that in order better\r\nto demonstrate the guiltlessness of the Order in the abduction of the\r\nJurands, the gauntlet was thrown down to the Mazovian knights,\r\nchallenging everybody who doubted, to God's judgment, i.e., to fight in\r\nthe presence of the whole court. \"None has taken it up,\" Rotgier\r\ncontinued, \"because all saw that in his letter Jurand himself bears\r\ntestimony for us, moreover they feared God's judgment, but a youth, the\r\nsame we saw in the forest court, came forward and picked up the gauntlet.\r\nDo not wonder then, O pious and wise brother, for that is the cause of my\r\ndelay in returning. Since I have challenged, I am obliged to stand. And\r\nsince I have done it for the glory of the Order, I trust that neither the\r\ngrand master nor you whom I honor and heartily love with filial affection\r\nwill count it ill. The adversary is quite a child, and as you know, I am\r\nnot a novice in fighting, it will then be an easy matter for me to shed\r\nhis blood for the glory of the Order, especially with the help of Christ,\r\nwho cares more for those who bear His cross than for a certain Jurand or\r\nfor the wrong done to a Mazovian girl!\" Zygfried was most surprised at\r\nthe news that Jurand's daughter was a married woman. The thought that\r\nthere was a possibility of a fresh menacing and revengeful enemy settling\r\nat Spychow inspired even the old count with alarm. \"It is clear,\" he said\r\nto himself, \"that he will not neglect to avenge himself, and much more so\r\nwhen he shall have received his wife and she tells him that we carried\r\nher off from the forest court! Yes, it would be at once evident that we\r\nbrought Jurand here for the purpose of destroying him, and that nobody\r\never thought of restoring his daughter to him.\" At this thought it struck\r\nZygfried that owing to the prince's letters, the grand master would most\r\nlikely institute an investigation in Szczytno so that he might at least\r\nclear himself in the eyes of the prince, since it was important for the\r\ngrand master and the chapter to have the Mazovian prince on their side in\r\ncase of war with the powerful king of Poland. To disregard the strength\r\nof the prince in face of the multitude of the Mazovian nobility was not\r\nto be lightly undertaken. To be at peace with them fully insured the\r\nknights' frontiers and permitted them better to concentrate their\r\nstrength. They had often spoken about it in the presence of Zygfried at\r\nMalborg, and often entertained the hope, that after having subdued the\r\nking, a pretext would be found later against the Mazovians and then no\r\npower could wrest that land from their hands. That was a great and sure\r\ncalculation. It was therefore certain that the master would at present do\r\neverything to avoid irritating Prince Janusz, because that prince who was\r\nmarried to Kiejstut's daughter was more difficult to reconcile than\r\nZiemowit of Plock, whose wife, for some unknown reason, was entirely\r\ndevoted to the Order.\r\n\r\nIn the face of these thoughts, old Zygfried, who was ready to commit all\r\nkinds of crimes, treachery and cruelty, only for the sake of the Order\r\nand its fame, began to calculate conscientiously:\r\n\r\n\"Would it not be better to let Jurand and his daughter go? The crime and\r\ninfamy weigh heavily on Danveld's name, and he is dead; even if the\r\nmaster should punish Rotgier and myself severely because we were the\r\naccomplices in Danveld's deeds, would it not be better for the Order?\"\r\nBut here his revengeful and cruel heart began to rebel at the thought of\r\nJurand.\r\n\r\nTo let him go, this oppressor and executioner of members of the Order,\r\nthis conqueror in so many encounters, the cause of so many infamies,\r\ncalamities and defeats, then the murderer of Danveld, the conqueror of\r\nvon Bergow, the murderer of Meineger, Godfried and Hugue, he who even in\r\nSzczytno itself shed more German blood than one good fight in war. \"No, I\r\ncannot! I cannot!\" Zygfried repeated vehemently, and at this thought his\r\nrapacious fingers closed spasmodically, and the old lean breast heaved\r\nheavily. Still, if it were for the great benefit and glory of the Order?\r\nIf the punishment should fall in that case upon the still living\r\nperpetrators of the crimes, Prince Janusz ought to be by this time\r\nreconciled with the foe and remove the difficulty by an arrangement, or\r\neven an alliance. \"They are furious,\" further thought the old count; \"but\r\nhe ought to show them some kindness, it is easy to forget a grievance.\r\nWhy, the prince himself in his own country was an abductor; then there is\r\nfear of revenge....\"\r\n\r\nThen he began to pace in the hall in mental distraction, and then stopped\r\nin front of the Crucifix, opposite the entrance, which occupied almost\r\nthe whole height of wall between the two windows, and kneeling at its\r\nfeet he said: \"Enlighten me, O Lord, teach me, for I know not! If I give\r\nup Jurand and his daughter then all our actions will be truly revealed,\r\nand the world will not say Danveld or Zygfried have done it but they will\r\nlay the blame upon the Knights of the Cross, and disgrace will fall upon\r\nthe whole Order, and the hatred of that prince will be greater than ever.\r\nIf I do not give them up but keep them or suppress the matter, then the\r\nOrder will be suspected and I shall be obliged to pollute my mouth with\r\nlying before the grand master. Which is better, Lord? Teach and enlighten\r\nme. If I must endure vengeance, then ordain it according to Thy justice;\r\nbut teach me now, enlighten me, for Thy religion is concerned, and\r\nwhatever Thou commandest I will do, even if it should result in my\r\nimprisonment and even if I were awaiting death and deliverance in\r\nfetters.\"\r\n\r\nAnd resting his brow upon the wooden cross he prayed for a long time; it\r\ndid not even for a moment cross his mind that it was a crooked and\r\nblasphemous prayer. Then he got up, calmed, thinking that the grace of\r\nthe wooden cross sent him a righteous and enlightened thought, and that a\r\nvoice from on high said to him: \"Arise and wait for the return of\r\nRotgier.\" \"So! I must wait. Rotgier will undoubtedly kill the young man;\r\nit will then be necessary to hide Jurand and his daughter, or give them\r\nup. In the first instance, it is true, the prince will not forget them,\r\nbut not being sure who abducted the girl he will search for her, he will\r\nsend letters to the grand master, not accusing him but inquiring, and the\r\naffair will be greatly prolonged. In the second instance, the joy at the\r\nreturn of Jurand's daughter will be greater than the desire to avenge her\r\nabduction. Surely we can always say that we have found her after Jurand's\r\noutrage.\" The last thought entirely calmed Zygfried. As to Jurand himself\r\nthere was no fear; for he and Rotgier had long before come to an\r\nunderstanding that in case Jurand were to be set free, he could neither\r\navenge himself nor harm them. Zygfried was glad in his terrible heart. He\r\nrejoiced also at the thought of God's judgment which was to take place in\r\nthe castle at Ciechanow. And as to the result of the mortal combat he was\r\nnot in the least alarmed. He recollected a certain tournament in\r\nKönigsberg when Rotgier overcame two powerful knights, who passed in\r\ntheir Andecave country as unconquerable fighters. He also remembered the\r\ncombat near Wilno, with a certain Polish knight, the courtier Spytko of\r\nMelsztyn, whom Rotgier killed. And his face brightened, and his heart\r\nexulted, for when Rotgier to a certain extent was already a celebrated\r\nknight, he first had led an expedition to Lithuania and had taught him\r\nthe best way to carry on a war with that tribe; for this reason he loved\r\nhim like a son, with such deep love, that only those who must have strong\r\naffections locked up in their hearts are able to do. Now that \"little\r\nson\" will once more shed hated Polish blood, and return covered with\r\nglory. Well, it is God's judgment, and the Order will at the same time be\r\ncleared of suspicion. \"God's judgment....\" In the twinkling of an eye, a\r\nfeeling akin to alarm oppressed his old heart. Behold, Rotgier must\r\nengage in mortal combat in defence of the innocence of the Order of the\r\nKnights of the Cross. Yet, they are guilty; he will therefore fight for\r\nthat falsehood.... What then if misfortune happen? But in a moment it\r\noccurred to him again that this was impossible. Yes! Rotgier justly\r\nwrites: \"That by the help of Christ who cares more for those who bear the\r\ncross than for a certain Jurand or the wrong done to one Mazovian girl.\"\r\nYes, Rotgier will return in three days, and return a conqueror.\r\n\r\nThus the old Knight of the Cross calmed himself, but at the same time he\r\nwondered whether it would not be advisable to send Danusia to some out of\r\nthe way, distant castle, from which in no possible manner the stratagems\r\nof the Mazovians could rescue her. But after hesitating for a moment he\r\ngave up that idea. To take overt action and accuse the Order, only\r\nJurandowna's husband could do that. But he will perish by Rotgier's hand.\r\nAfter that, there will only be investigations, inquiries, correspondence,\r\nand accusations from the prince. But this very procedure will greatly\r\nretard the affair, and it will be confused and obscured, and it goes\r\nwithout saying, it will be infinitely delayed. \"Before it comes to\r\nanything,\" said Zygfried to himself, \"I shall die, and it may also be\r\nthat Jurandowna will grow old in the prison of the Knights of the Cross.\r\nNevertheless, I shall order that everything in the castle be prepared for\r\ndefence, and at the same time to make ready for the road, because I do\r\nnot exactly know what will be the result of the meeting with Rotgier:\r\nTherefore I shall wait.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile two of the three days, in which Rotgier had promised to return,\r\npassed by; then three and four, yet no retinue made its appearance at the\r\ngates of Szczytno. Only on the fifth day, well-nigh toward dark, the\r\nblast of the horn resounded in front of the bastion at the gate of the\r\nfortress. Zygfried, who was just finishing his vesper prayer, immediately\r\ndispatched a page to see who had arrived.\r\n\r\nAfter a while the page returned with a troubled face. This Zygfried did\r\nnot observe on account of the darkness, for the fire in the stove was too\r\nfar back to illuminate the room sufficiently.\r\n\r\n\"Have they returned?\" inquired the old Knight of the Cross.\r\n\r\n\"Yes!\" replied the page.\r\n\r\nBut there was something in his voice which alarmed the old knight, and he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"And Brother Rotgier?\"\r\n\r\n\"They have brought Brother Rotgier.\"\r\n\r\nThen Zygfried got up and for a long while he held on to the arm of the\r\nchair to prevent himself from falling, then in a stifled voice he said:\r\n\r\n\"Give me the cloak.\"\r\n\r\nThe page placed the cloak on his shoulders. He had apparently regained\r\nhis strength, for he put on the cowl himself without assistance, then he\r\nwent out.\r\n\r\nIn a moment he found himself in the courtyard of the castle, where it was\r\nalready quite dark; he walked slowly upon the cracking snow toward the\r\nretinue which was coming through the gate. He stopped near it where a\r\ncrowd had already gathered, and several torches, which the soldiers of\r\nthe guard brought, illuminated the scene. At the sight of the old knight\r\nthe servants opened a way for him. By the light of the torches could be\r\nseen the terrified faces, and the whispering of the people could be heard\r\nin the dark background:\r\n\r\n\"Brother Rotgier....\"\r\n\r\n\"Brother Rotgier has been killed....\"\r\n\r\nZygfried drew near the sleigh, upon which the corpse was stretched on\r\nstraw and covered with a cloak; he lifted one end of it.\r\n\r\n\"Bring a light,\" he said, whilst drawing aside the cowl.\r\n\r\nOne of the servants brought a torch which he held toward the corpse and\r\nby its light the old knight observed the head of Rotgier; the face was\r\nwhite as if frozen and bandaged with a black kerchief fastened under the\r\nbeard, evidently for the purpose of keeping the mouth closed. The whole\r\nface was drawn and so much altered that it might be mistaken for somebody\r\nelse's. The eyes were closed, and around them and near the temples were\r\nblue patches, and the cheeks were scaly with frost. The old knight gazed\r\nat it for a long while amid complete silence. Others looked at him, for\r\nit was known that he was like a father to Rotgier, and that he loved him.\r\nBut he did not shed even a single tear, only his face looked more severe\r\nthan usual, but there was depicted in it a kind of torpid calm.\r\n\r\n\"They sent him back thus!\" he said at last.\r\n\r\nBut he immediately turned toward the steward of the castle and said:\r\n\r\n\"Let a coffin be prepared by midnight, and place the body in the chapel.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is one coffin left of those which were made for those Jurand\r\nkilled; it wants only to be covered with cloth, which I shall order to be\r\ndone.\"\r\n\r\n\"And cover him with a cloak,\" said Zygfried, whilst covering the face of\r\nRotgier, \"not with one like this but with one of the Order.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a while he added:\r\n\r\n\"Do not close the lid.\"\r\n\r\nThe people approached the sleigh. Zygfried again pulled the cowl over his\r\nhead, but he recollected something before leaving, and he asked:\r\n\r\n\"Where is van Krist?\"\r\n\r\n\"He also was killed,\" replied one of the servants, \"but they were obliged\r\nto bury him in Ciechanow because putrefaction set in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well.\"\r\n\r\nThen he left, walking slowly, entered the room and sat down upon the same\r\nchair where he was when the tidings reached him; his face was as if\r\npetrified and motionless and he sat there so long that the page began to\r\nbe alarmed; he put his head halfway in the door now and then. Hour after\r\nhour passed by. The customary stir ceased within the castle, but from the\r\ndirection of the chapel came a dull indistinct hammering; then nothing\r\ndisturbed the silence but the calls of the watchmen.\r\n\r\nIt was already about midnight when the old knight awoke as from sleep,\r\nand called the servant.\r\n\r\n\"Where is Brother Rotgier?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nBut the servant, unnerved by the silence, events and sleeplessness,\r\napparently did not understand him, but looked at him with fear and\r\nreplied in a trembling voice:\r\n\r\n\"I do not know, sir....\"\r\n\r\nThe old man burst out into laughter and said mildly:\r\n\r\n\"Child, I asked whether he is already in the chapel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well then. Tell Diedrich to come here with a lantern and wait until\r\nmy return; let him also have a small kettle of coals. Is there already a\r\nlight in the chapel?\"\r\n\r\n\"There are candles burning about the coffin.\"\r\n\r\nZygfried put on his cloak and left.\r\n\r\nWhen he entered the chapel, he looked around to see whether anybody else\r\nwas present; then he closed the door carefully, approached the coffin,\r\nput aside two of the six candles burning in large brazen candlesticks in\r\nfront of him, and knelt down before it.\r\n\r\nAs his lips did not move, it showed that he was not praying. For some\r\ntime he only looked at the drawn yet still handsome face of Rotgier as\r\nthough he were trying to discover in it traces of life.\r\n\r\nThen amid the dead silence in the chapel he began to call in suppressed\r\ntones:\r\n\r\n\"Dear little son! Dear little son!\"\r\n\r\nThen he remained silent; it seemed as though he were expecting an answer.\r\n\r\nThen he stretched out his hand and pushed his emaciated talon-like\r\nfingers under the cloak, uncovered Rotgier's breast and began to feel\r\nabout it, looking everywhere at the middle and sides below the ribs and\r\nalong the shoulder-blades: at last he touched the rent in the clothing\r\nwhich extended from the top of the right shoulder down to the armpit, his\r\nfingers penetrated and felt along the whole length of the wound, then he\r\ncried with a loud voice which sounded like a complaint:\r\n\r\n\"Oh!... What merciless thing is this!... Yet thou saidst that fellow was\r\nquite a child!... The whole arm! The whole arm? So many times thou hast\r\nraised it against the Pagans in defence of the Order.... In the name of\r\nthe Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. Thou foughtest falsely, and so\r\nsuccumbed in a false cause; be absolved and may thy soul....\"\r\n\r\nThe words were cut short on his lips which began to tremble, and deep\r\nsilence reigned once more in the chapel.\r\n\r\n\"Dear little son! Dear little son!\"\r\n\r\nNow there was something like a petition in Zygfried's voice, and at the\r\nsame time it seemed as he lowered his voice as though his petition\r\ncontained some important and terrible secret.\r\n\r\n\"Merciful Christ!... If thou art not condemned, give a sign, move thy\r\nhand, or give one twitch of the eye, for my old heart is groaning within\r\nmy breast.... Give a sign, I loved thee, say one word!...\"\r\n\r\nAnd supporting himself with his hands upon the edge of the coffin, he\r\nfastened his vulture-like eyes upon the closed eyelids of Rotgier and\r\nwaited.\r\n\r\n\"Bah! How couldst thou speak?\" said he, at last, \"when frost and evil\r\nodor emanate from thee. But as thou art silent, then I will tell thee\r\nsomething, and let thy soul, flying about here among the flaming candles,\r\nlisten!\"\r\n\r\nThen he bent down to the face of the corpse.\r\n\r\n\"Dost thou remember how the chaplain would not permit us to kill Jurand\r\nand how we took an oath. Well, I will keep that oath, but I will cause\r\nthee to rejoice wherever thou art, even at the cost of my own damnation.\"\r\n\r\nThen he retreated from the coffin, replaced the candlesticks, covered the\r\ncorpse with the cloak, and left the chapel.\r\n\r\nAt the door of the room, overpowered with deep sleep, slept the servant,\r\nand according to Zygfried's orders Diedrich was already waiting inside.\r\nHe was of low stature thickly set, with bowed legs and a square face\r\nwhich was concealed by a dark cowl falling to his arm. He was dressed in\r\nan untanned buffalo jacket, also a buffalo belt upon his hips from which\r\nwas hanging a bunch of keys and a short knife. In his right hand he held\r\na membrane-covered lantern; in the other, a small kettle and a torch.\r\n\r\n\"Are you ready?\" inquired Zygfried.\r\n\r\nDiedrich bowed silently.\r\n\r\n\"I gave orders for you to bring with you a kettle with coal in it.\"\r\n\r\nThe short fellow was still silent; he only pointed to the burning wood in\r\nthe fireplace and took the iron shovel standing at the fireside, and\r\nfilled the kettle with the burning coal, then he lit the lantern and\r\nwaited.\r\n\r\n\"Now listen, dog,\" said Zygfried; \"you have never revealed what Count\r\nDanveld commanded you to do; the count also ordered the cutting out of\r\nyour tongue. But you can still motion to the chaplain with your fingers.\r\nI therefore forewarn you, if you show him even with the slightest motion\r\nof your hand what you are to do now by my command, I shall order you to\r\nbe hanged.\"\r\n\r\nDiedrich again bowed in silence, but his face was drawn on account of the\r\nterrible, ominous recollection; for his tongue was torn out for quite\r\nanother reason than what Zygfried said.\r\n\r\n\"Now proceed, and lead to the underground cell where Jurand is.\"\r\n\r\nThe executioner grasped the handle of the kettle with his gigantic hand,\r\npicked up the lantern and then left. At the door they passed by the guard\r\nwho was asleep, descended the stairs, and turned, not toward the\r\nprincipal entrance, but directed their steps to the small corridor in the\r\nrear of the stairs, extending through the whole width of the edifice, and\r\nterminating in a heavy iron door which was concealed in a niche in the\r\nwall. Diedrich opened it and they found themselves again in the open air\r\nin a small courtyard surrounded on its four sides by high walled\r\ngranaries where they kept their stores in case the castle should be\r\nbesieged. Underneath one of these stores, on the right, was an\r\nunderground prison. There was not a single guard standing there, because\r\neven if a prisoner should succeed in breaking through from the\r\nunderground prison, he would then find himself in the courtyard which\r\nonly gave exit through the door in the niche.\r\n\r\n\"Wait,\" said Zygfried, and leaning against the wall, he rested, for he\r\nfelt that something was the matter with him; he was short of breath, as\r\nthough his breast was too much tightened under the straight coat of mail.\r\nIn plain terms, considering what had happened, he felt his old age, and\r\nhis brow under the cowl was covered with drops of perspiration; he\r\ntherefore stopped for a moment to recover breath.\r\n\r\nThe night following the gloomy day became extraordinarily clear and the\r\nlittle courtyard was brightly illuminated by the rays of the moon which\r\ncaused the snow to glisten with a yellowish tint. Zygfried inhaled with\r\npleasure the cool invigorating air, but he forgot that on a similar\r\nbright night Rotgier left for Ciechanow whence he did not return alive.\r\n\r\n\"And now thou liest in the chapel,\" he murmured to himself.\r\n\r\nDiedrich thought that the count was talking to him; he therefore lifted\r\nup his lantern and threw its light upon his face which had a terrible and\r\ncadaverous appearance, but at the same time it looked like the head of an\r\nold vulture.\r\n\r\n\"Lead on,\" said Zygfried.\r\n\r\nDiedrich lowered the lantern again which cast upon the snow a yellow\r\ncircle of light and they proceeded. In the thick wall of the storehouse\r\nthere was a recess in which several steps led to a large iron door.\r\nDiedrich opened it and went down the stairs in the deep dark aperture,\r\nraising the lantern so as to show the way to the count. At the end of the\r\nstairs there was a corridor in which, to the right and left, were\r\nexceedingly low doors leading to the cells of the prisoners.\r\n\r\n\"To Jurand!\" said Zygfried.\r\n\r\nAnd in a moment the bars creaked and they entered, but there was perfect\r\ndarkness in the cell. But Zygfried, who could not see well in the dim\r\nlight from the lantern, ordered the torch to be lighted, and in a moment\r\nhe was enabled by its bright light to see Jurand lying on the straw. The\r\nprisoner's feet were fettered, but the chains on the hands were somewhat\r\nlonger so as to enable him to carry food to his mouth. Upon his body was\r\nthe same coarse sackcloth which he had on when he was arraigned before\r\nthe court, but now it was covered with dark blood-stains, because, that\r\nday when the fight ended, only when maddened with pain the frantic knight\r\nwas entangled in the net, the soldiers then tried to kill him, struck him\r\nwith their halberds and inflicted upon him numerous wounds. The chaplain\r\ninterfered and Jurand was not killed outright, but he lost so much blood\r\nthat he was carried to prison half dead. In the castle they expected his\r\ndeath hourly. But owing to his immense strength he prevailed over death,\r\nalthough they did not attend to his wounds, and he was cast into the\r\nterrible subterranean prison, in which during the daytime when it thawed\r\ndrops fell from the roof, but when there was frost the walls were thickly\r\ncovered with snow and icicles.\r\n\r\nOn the ground on the straw lay the powerless man in chains, but he looked\r\nlike a piece of flint shaped in human form. Zygfried commanded Diedrich\r\nto throw the light directly upon Jurand's face, then he gazed at it for a\r\nwhile in silence. Then he turned to Diedrich and said:\r\n\r\n\"Observe, he has only one eye--destroy it.\"\r\n\r\nThere was something in his voice like sickness and decrepitude, and for\r\nthat very reason, the horrible order sounded more terrible, so that the\r\ntorch began somewhat to tremble in the hand of the executioner. Yet he\r\ninclined it toward Jurand's face, and in a moment big drops of burning\r\ntar began to fall upon the eye of Jurand, covering it entirely from the\r\nbrow down to the projecting cheek bone.\r\n\r\nJurand's face twitched, his grey mustachios moved, but he did not utter a\r\nsingle word of complaint. Whether it was from exhaustion, or the grand\r\nfortitude of his terrible nature, he did not even groan.\r\n\r\nZygfried said:\r\n\r\n\"It has been promised that you shall be freed, and you shall be, but you\r\nshall not be able to accuse the Order, for your tongue, which you might\r\nuse against it, shall be torn out.\"\r\n\r\nThen he again signaled to the executioner who replied with a strange\r\nguttural sound and showed by signs that for this he roust employ both\r\nhands, and therefore wanted the count to hold the light.\r\n\r\nThen the old count took the torch and held it in his outstretched,\r\ntrembling hand, but when Diedrich pressed Jurand's chest with his knees\r\nZygfried turned his head and looked at the hoarfrost covered wall.\r\n\r\nFor a while resounded the clank of the chains, followed by the suppressed\r\npanting of a human breast which sounded like one dull, deep groan--and\r\nthen all was still.\r\n\r\nFinally Zygfried said:\r\n\r\n\"Jurand, the punishment which you have suffered you have deserved; but I\r\nhave promised to Brother Rotgier, whom your son-in-law has killed, to\r\nplace your right hand in his coffin.\"\r\n\r\nDiedrich, who had just got up from his last deed, bent again upon the\r\nprostrate form of Jurand, when he heard Zygfried's words.\r\n\r\nAfter a little while, the old count and Diedrich found themselves again\r\nin that open courtyard which was illuminated by the bright moon. When\r\nthey reëntered the corridor, Zygfried took the lantern from Diedrich,\r\nalso a dark object wrapped up in a rag, and said to himself in a loud\r\nvoice,\r\n\r\n\"Now to the chapel and then to the tower.\"\r\n\r\nDiedrich looked keenly at the count, but the count commanded him to go to\r\nsleep; he covered himself, hanging the lantern near the lighted window of\r\nthe chapel and left. On his way he meditated upon what had just taken\r\nplace. He was almost sure that his own end had also arrived and that\r\nthese were his last deeds in this world, and that he would have to\r\naccount for them before God. But his soul, the soul of a \"Knight of the\r\nCross,\" although naturally more cruel than mendacious, had in the course\r\nof inexorable necessity got accustomed to fraud, assassination and\r\nconcealing the sanguinary deeds of the Order, he now involuntarily sought\r\nto cast off the ignominy and responsibility for Jurand's tortures, from\r\nboth himself and the Order. Diedrich was dumb and could not confess, and,\r\nalthough he could make himself understood with the chaplain, he would be\r\nafraid to do so. What then? Nobody would know. Jurand might well have\r\nreceived all his wounds during the fight. He might have easily lost his\r\ntongue by the thrust of a lance between his teeth. An axe or a sword\r\nmight have easily cut off his right hand. He had only one eye; would it\r\nbe strange therefore that the other eye was lost in the fracas, for he\r\nthrew himself madly upon the whole garrison of Szczytno. Alas! Jurand!\r\nHis last joy in life trembled for a moment in the heart of the old Knight\r\nof the Cross. So, should Jurand survive, he ought to be set free. At\r\nthis, Zygfried remembered a conversation he had had once with Rotgier\r\nabout this, when that young brother laughingly remarked: \"Then let him go\r\nwhere _his eyes will carry him_, and if he does not happen to strike\r\nSpychow, then let him _make inquiries_ on the road.\" For that which had\r\nnow happened was a part of the prearranged programme between them. But\r\nnow Zygfried reentered the chapel and, kneeling in front of the coffin,\r\nhe laid at Rotgier's feet Jurand's bleeding hand; that last joy which\r\nstartled him was only for a moment and quickly disappeared, for the last\r\ntime, from his face.\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" he said, \"I have done more than we agreed to do. For King John\r\nof Luxemburg, although he was blind, kept on fighting and perished\r\ngloriously. But Jurand can stand no more and will perish like a dog\r\nbehind the fence.\"\r\n\r\nAt this he again felt that shortness of breath that had seized him on his\r\nway to Jurand, also a weight on his head as of a heavy iron helmet, but\r\nthis only lasted a second. Then he drew a deep breath and said:\r\n\r\n\"Ah! My time has also come. You were the only one I had; but now I have\r\nnone. But if I lived longer, I vow to you, O little son, that I would\r\nalso place upon your grave that hand which killed you, or perish myself.\r\nThe murderer who killed you is still alive....\"\r\n\r\nHere his teeth clinched and such an intense cramp seized him that he\r\ncould not speak for some time. Then he began again, but in a broken\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n\"Yes, your murderer still lives, but I will cut him to pieces ... and\r\nothers with him, and I will inflict upon them tortures even worse than\r\ndeath itself....\"\r\n\r\nThen he ceased.\r\n\r\nIn a moment he rose again and approaching the coffin, he began to speak\r\nin quiet tones,\r\n\r\n\"Now I take leave of you ... and look into your face for the last time;\r\nperhaps I shall be able to see in your face whether you are pleased with\r\nmy promises.... The last time.\"\r\n\r\nThen he uncovered Rotgier's face, but suddenly he retreated.\r\n\r\n\"You are smiling, ...\" he said, \"but you are smiling terribly....\"\r\n\r\nIn fact, the frozen corpse, which was covered with the mantle, had\r\nthawed. It may be from the heat of the burning candles, it had begun to\r\ndecompose with extraordinary rapidity, and the face of the young count\r\nlooked indeed terrible. The enormously swollen, and livid mouth looked\r\nsomething monstrous, the blue and swollen curled lips had the appearance\r\nof a grinning smile.\r\n\r\nZygfried covered that terrible human mask as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\nThen he took the lantern and left the chapel. Here again, for the third\r\ntime, he felt shortness of breath; he entered the house and threw himself\r\nupon his hard bed of the Order and lay for a time motionless. He thought\r\nhe would fall asleep, when suddenly a strange feeling overpowered him; it\r\nseemed to him that he would never again be able to sleep, and that if he\r\nremained in that house death would soon follow.\r\n\r\nZygfried, in his extreme weariness, and without hope of sleep, was not\r\nafraid of death; on the contrary he regarded it as an exceedingly great\r\nrelief. But he had no wish to submit himself to it that evening. So he\r\nsat up in his bed and cried:\r\n\r\n\"Give me time till to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nThen he distinctly heard a voice whispering in his ear:\r\n\r\n\"Leave this house. It will be too late to-morrow and you will not be able\r\nto accomplish your promise. Leave this house!\"\r\n\r\nThe count got up with difficulty and went out. The guards were calling to\r\none another from the bastions upon the palisades. The light emanating\r\nfrom the windows of the chapel illuminated the snow in front with a\r\nyellow gleam. In the middle of the court near the stone wall were two\r\nblack dogs playing and tugging at a black rag. Beyond this the courtyard\r\nwas empty and silent.\r\n\r\n\"It is yet necessary this night!\" said Zygfried. \"I am exceedingly tired,\r\nbut I must go.... All are asleep. Jurand, overcome by torture, might also\r\nbe asleep. I only am unable to sleep. I will go. I will go, for there is\r\ndeath within, and I have promised you.... Let death come afterward; sleep\r\nwill not come. You are smiling there, but my strength is failing me. You\r\nare smiling, you are apparently glad. But you see that my fingers are\r\nbenumbed, my hands have lost their strength, and I cannot accomplish it\r\nby myself ... the servant with whom she sleeps will accomplish it....\"\r\n\r\nThen he moved on with heavy steps toward the tower situated near the\r\ngate. Meanwhile the dogs which were playing near the stone wall came\r\nrunning up and began to fawn upon him. In one of them Zygfried recognized\r\nthe bulldog which was so much attached to Diedrich that it was said in\r\nthe castle that it served him as a pillow at night.\r\n\r\nThe dog greeted the count, it barked low once or twice; and then returned\r\ntoward the gate acting as though it had divined his thoughts.\r\n\r\nAfter a while Zygfried found himself in front of the narrow little doors\r\nof the tower, which at night were barred on the outside. Removing the\r\nbars, he felt for the balustrade of the stairs which commenced quite near\r\nthe doors and began to ascend. In his absentmindedness he forgot the\r\nlantern; he therefore went up gropingly, stepping carefully and feeling\r\nwith his feet for the steps.\r\n\r\nHaving advanced a few steps, he suddenly halted, when below quite near\r\nhim he heard something like the breathing of a man, or beast.\r\n\r\n\"Who is there?\"\r\n\r\nBut there was no answer, only the breathing grew quicker.\r\n\r\nZygfried was not a timid man; he was not afraid of death. But the\r\npreceding terrible night had quite exhausted his courage and\r\nself-control. It crossed his mind that Rotgier or the evil spirit was\r\nbarring his way, and his hair stood up on his head and his brow was\r\ncovered with cold sweat.\r\n\r\nHe retreated to the very entrance.\r\n\r\n\"Who is there?\" he asked, with a choked voice.\r\n\r\nBut at that moment something struck him a powerful blow on his chest, so\r\nterrible that the old man fell through the door upon his back and\r\nswooned. He did not even groan.\r\n\r\nSilence followed, after which there could be seen a dark form, stealthily\r\nissuing from the tower and making off toward the stable which was\r\nsituated on the left side of the courtyard near the arsenal. Diedrich's\r\nbig bulldog followed that figure silently. The other dog also ran after\r\nhim and disappeared in the shadow of the wall, but shortly appeared again\r\nwith its head to the ground, scenting as it were the trail of the other\r\ndog. In this manner the dog approached the prostrate and lifeless body of\r\nZygfried, which it smelled carefully, then crouched near the head of the\r\nprostrate man and began to howl.\r\n\r\nThe howling continued for a long while, filling the air of that sombre\r\nnight with a new kind of dolefulness and horror. Finally the small door\r\nconcealed in the middle of the gate creaked and a guard armed with a\r\nhalberd appeared in the courtyard.\r\n\r\n\"Death upon that dog,\" he said, \"I'll teach you to howl during the\r\nnight.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he aimed the sharp end of the halberd so as to hit the animal with\r\nit, but at that moment he observed something lying near the little open\r\ndoor of the bastion.\r\n\r\n\"Lord Jesus! what is that?...\"\r\n\r\nHe bent his head so as to look in the face of the prostrate man, and\r\nbegan to shout:\r\n\r\n\"Help! Help! Help!\"\r\n\r\nThen he rushed to the gate and pulled with all his strength at the\r\nbell-rope.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF PART FIFTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART SIXTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nAlthough Glowacz was somewhat anxious to hasten to Zgorzelice, he could\r\nnot make the progress he wished, because the road was exceedingly bad. A\r\ngeneral thaw had followed the severe winter, keen frost, and immense\r\nsnowdrifts which covered whole villages.\r\n\r\nLuty (February), in spite of its name,[110] by no means showed itself\r\nformidable. First there were thick, continuous fogs, succeeded by\r\ntorrential rains, which melted the white snowdrifts before one's eyes;\r\nand in the intervals there were very high winds as is usual in the month\r\nof March; then the tempestuous clouds were suddenly torn asunder by the\r\nwind which now drove them together, and now scattered them, whilst on the\r\nearth the wind howled in the thickets, whistled in the forests and\r\ndispersed the snow beneath which only a short time before the boughs and\r\ntrunks had slept their silent, wintry sleep.\r\n\r\nThe woods assumed a dark color. The meadows were inundated with broad\r\nsheets of water. The rivers and streams overflowed. Only the fishermen\r\nwere glad at the abundance of the watery element, but the rest of\r\nhumanity were confined as within a prison, sheltering themselves within\r\ntheir houses and huts. In many places communication between village and\r\nvillage could only be effected by means of boats. There was no lack of\r\ndams, dykes and roads through the forests and swamps, constructed of\r\ntrunks, of trees and logs, but now the dykes became soft and the stumps\r\nin the low, wet places endangered travel, or the roads were rendered\r\naltogether impracticable. The most difficult part for the Bohemian to\r\ntraverse was the lake-land region of Wielkopolska, where every spring the\r\nthaw was greater than in any other part of Poland. Consequently the road\r\nwas specially difficult for horses.\r\n\r\nHe was therefore obliged to wait whole weeks, sometimes in small towns,\r\nsometimes in villages and farms, where he and his men were hospitably\r\nreceived, according to custom, by the people, who were willing listeners\r\nto the tale of the \"Knights of the Cross,\" and paid for it with bread and\r\nsalt. For this reason spring was already far advanced, and the greater\r\npart of March had already passed before he found himself in the\r\nneighborhood of Zgorzelice and Bogdaniec.\r\n\r\nHe longed to see his mistress as soon as possible, although he knew that\r\nhe could never gain her, even as he could not gain the stars of heaven;\r\nnevertheless he adored and loved her with his whole soul. Yet he resolved\r\nfirst to go and see Macko; first, because he was sent to him; secondly,\r\nbecause he was bringing men with him who were to be left at Bogdanice.\r\nZbyszko, having killed Rotgier, according to established rules, became\r\nthe owner of his following, which consisted of ten men and as many\r\nhorses. Two of them had been sent back with the body of Rotgier to\r\nSzczytno. Knowing how anxious his uncle was to obtain colonists, he sent\r\nthe remaining eight men by Glowacz as a present to old Macko.\r\n\r\nThe Bohemian, on his arrival at Bogdaniec, did not find Macko at home; he\r\nwas informed that Macko had gone with his dogs and crossbow to the\r\nforest; but he returned the same day, and having heard that an important\r\nretinue was waiting for him, he hastened to salute the guests and offer\r\nthem hospitality. He did not recognize Glowacz at first, but when he gave\r\nhis name, Macko was greatly agitated, and throwing down his hat and\r\ncrossbow he cried:\r\n\r\n\"For God's sake! tell me, have they killed him? Tell what you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"They have not killed him,\" replied the Bohemian. \"He is enjoying good\r\nhealth.\"\r\n\r\nOn hearing this, Macko was somewhat ashamed of himself, and began to\r\npuff; at last he drew a deep breath.\r\n\r\n\"Praised be the Lord Christ,\" he said. \"Where is he now?\"\r\n\r\n\"He left for Malborg and sent me here with news.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why did he go to Malborg?\"\r\n\r\n\"To fetch his wife.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be careful, boy, in the name of God what wife did he go for?\"\r\n\r\n\"For Jurand's daughter. There is much to be told about it, enough for a\r\nwhole night, but, honored sir, allow me to rest a little, for I have been\r\nconstantly traveling since midnight.\"\r\n\r\nMacko ceased questioning for a little while, for his great surprise\r\ndeprived him of speech. When he had somewhat recovered, he shouted to the\r\nservant to throw some wood on the fire and bring food for the Bohemian;\r\nthen he began to pace up and down, gesticulating and talking to himself:\r\n\r\n\"I cannot believe mine own ears.... Jurand's daughter.... Zbyszko\r\nmarried....\"\r\n\r\n\"He is married and not married,\" said the Bohemian.\r\n\r\nThen he began slowly to relate what had happened, while Macko listened\r\neagerly, only interrupting with questions when what the Bohemian related\r\nwas not quite clear to him. For instance, Glowacz could not give the\r\nexact time when Zbyszko had got married, as there had been no public\r\nmarriage. Nevertheless he affirmed that that marriage had surely taken\r\nplace, and that it had come to pass owing to the instigation of Princess\r\nAnna Danuta, and had been made public only after the arrival of the\r\nKnight of the Cross, Rotgier, when Zbyszko had challenged him to the\r\njudgment of God, in the presence of the entire Mazovian court.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! He fought?\" Macko exclaimed, his eyes sparkling with intense\r\ncuriosity. \"What followed?\"\r\n\r\n\"He cut the German in two, and God also made me happy by delivering the\r\narmor-bearer into my hands.\"\r\n\r\nMacko again began to puff, but this time with an air of satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\"Well!\" he said. \"He is a fellow not to be trifled with. He is the last\r\nof the Gradys, but so help me God, not the least. He was that already in\r\nthe fight with the Fryzjans ... when he was a mere stripling....\"\r\n\r\nHere he glanced sharply once and again at the Bohemian, then he\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n\"And so you tried to imitate him, and it seems you tell the truth. I\r\ndoubted your words, but, as you yourself say, you had little work with\r\nthe armor-bearer. But if he chopped off the arm of that dog-brother after\r\nkilling the Aurochs, those are valiant deeds.\"\r\n\r\nThen he suddenly asked:\r\n\r\n\"Is there rich spoil?\"\r\n\r\n\"We have taken the arms, horses and ten men, eight of whom, the young\r\nlord sends you.\"\r\n\r\n\"What has he done with the other two?\"\r\n\r\n\"He sent them back with the corpse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did not the prince send two of his own servants? Those two will not\r\nreturn.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bohemian smiled at Macko's greed which often betrayed him.\r\n\r\n\"The young lord need not consider such trifles now,\" he said, \"Spychow is\r\na large estate.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a large estate; what of it, it is not yet his.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then whose is it?\"\r\n\r\nMacko rose from his seat.\r\n\r\n\"Speak! and Jurand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Jurand is a prisoner, and dying, in the hands of the Knights of the\r\nCross. God knows whether he will survive, and even if he survives and\r\nreturns, what of it? Did not Father Caleb read Jurand's testament,\r\nannouncing to all that the young lord is to be their master?\"\r\n\r\nThe last words obviously made a great impression upon Macko; because he\r\nwas too much amazed to thoroughly grasp the news. That Zbyszko had got\r\nmarried was painful to him at the first moment, for he loved Jagienka\r\nwith a fatherly love, and heartily wished to see Zbyszko united to her.\r\nBut, on the other hand, he had already grown accustomed to regard the\r\naffair as lost; moreover Jurandowna brought with her so much that\r\nJagienka could never bring; the prince's favor, and being an only\r\ndaughter her dower was many times greater. Macko already saw Zbyszko, as\r\nthe prince's friend, the master of Bogdaniec and of Spychow; nay, in the\r\nnear future, a castellan. That was not at all unlikely. For it was told\r\nin those days of a certain poor nobleman who had twelve sons, six fell in\r\nbattle and the other six became castellans and were advancing toward\r\ngreatness; only a reputation could assist Zbyszko in this career, so that\r\nMacko's ambition and greed for a pedigree might be realized according to\r\nhis wishes. The old man, however, had much cause for alarm. He, himself,\r\nhad once gone to the Knights of the Cross, to save Zbyszko and brought\r\nback with him an iron splinter between the ribs; now Zbyszko had gone to\r\nMalborg, into the very throat of the wolf. Was it to get his wife there\r\nor death? They would not look upon him there with a favorable eye,\r\nthought Macko. He had just destroyed one of their famous knights and\r\nbefore that he had killed Lichtenstein. Those dog-blooded men loved\r\nvengeance. That thought made the old knight very uneasy. It also occurred\r\nto him that Zbyszko, being quick tempered, would engage in a fight with\r\nsome German; or what he most feared was that they would kidnap him as\r\nthey had old Jurand and his daughter. At Zlotorja they did not scruple to\r\nkidnap even the prince himself. Why then should they be scrupulous with\r\nZbyszko?\r\n\r\nThen he asked himself what would happen if the youngster should escape\r\nthe knights, but not find his wife? This thought pleased him, because\r\neven if Zbyszko should not recover her, he would still be the owner of\r\nSpychow, but that pleasure only lasted for a moment. For while the old\r\nman was much concerned about the property, yet Zbyszko's offspring\r\ninterested him quite as much. If Danusia were to be lost, like a stone in\r\nthe water and nobody knew whether she were alive or dead, Zbyszko could\r\nnot marry another, and then there would be no heir to the Gradys of\r\nBogdaniec. Ah! It would be quite another thing if he were married to\r\nJagienka!... Moczydoly was not to be scorned; it was spacious and well\r\nstocked. Such a girl, like an apple-tree in the orchard, would bring\r\nforth every year without fail. Thus Macko's regret was greater than his\r\njoy at the prospect of the possession of the new estate. His regret and\r\nagitation caused him to renew his questions, and he again inquired of the\r\nBohemian how and when the marriage had taken place.\r\n\r\nBut the Bohemian replied:\r\n\r\n\"I have told you already, honored sir, that I do not know when it\r\nhappened, and what I conjecture I cannot confirm with an oath.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you conjecture?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have never left my young master and we slept together. On one evening\r\nonly, he ordered me to leave him when I saw them all visit him: the\r\nprincess accompanied by the lady Jurandowna, (Danusia,) Lord de Lorche\r\nand Father Wyszoniek. I was even surprised to see the young lady with a\r\nwreath on her head; but I thought they had come to administer the\r\nsacrament to my master.... It may be that the marriage took place\r\nthen.... I recollect that the master commanded me to attire myself as for\r\na wedding ceremony, but then I also thought that that was to receive the\r\neucharist.\"\r\n\r\n\"And after that, did they remain by themselves?\"\r\n\r\n\"They did not remain alone; and even if they had remained by themselves\r\nthe master was then so feeble that he could not even eat without\r\nassistance. And there were already people sent by Jurand waiting for the\r\nyoung lady, and she left the following morning....\"\r\n\r\n\"Then Zbyszko has not seen her since?\"\r\n\r\n\"No human eye has seen her.\"\r\n\r\nThen silence reigned for a while.\r\n\r\n\"What do you think?\" asked Macko, presently. \"Will the Knights of the\r\nCross give her up, or not?\"\r\n\r\nThe Bohemian shook his head, then he waved his hand discouragingly.\r\n\r\n\"I think,\" he said, slowly, \"she is lost forever.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" asked Macko in terror.\r\n\r\n\"Because, when they said they had her there was yet hope, one could yet\r\ncontend with them, either to ransom her, or take her from them by force.\r\n'But,' they said, 'we had a girl retaken from robbers and we notified\r\nJurand; he did not recognize her, and he killed of our people, in our\r\nvery presence, more than fall in one good fight in war.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Then they showed Jurand some other girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"So it is said. God knows the truth. It may not be true, and it may be\r\nthat they showed him some other girl. But it is a fact that he killed\r\npeople, and the Knights of the Cross are ready to swear that they never\r\nabducted Panna Jurandowna, and that is an exceedingly difficult affair.\r\nEven should the grand master order an investigation, they would reply\r\nthat she was not in their hands; especially since the courtiers of\r\nCiechanow spoke of Jurand's letter in which he said that she was not with\r\nthe Knights of the Cross.\"\r\n\r\n\"It may be she is not with them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon, sir!... If they had recaptured her from the robbers,\r\nit would have been for no other motive than for ransom. The robbers,\r\nbefore that happened could neither write a letter nor imitate the\r\nsignature of the lord of Spychow, nor send an honorable messenger.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true; but what do the Knights of the Cross want her for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Revenge on Jurand's race. They prefer vengeance to mead and wine; and if\r\nthey want a pretext, they have one. The lord of Spychow was terrible to\r\nthem, and his last deed completely finished them.... My master, I also\r\nheard, had lifted up his hand against Lichtenstein; he killed Rotgier....\r\nGod helped me, too, to shatter that dog-brother's arm. Wait, I pray, let\r\nus consider. There were four of them to be exterminated; now hardly one\r\nis alive, and that one is an old man, and your grace must bear in mind\r\nthat we yet have our teeth.\"\r\n\r\nThere was again silence for a moment.\r\n\r\n\"You are a discreet armor-bearer,\" said Macko, at last; \"but what do you\r\nthink they are going to do with her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Prince Witold, they say, is a powerful prince, even the German emperor\r\nbows to him; and what did they do to his children? Have they but few\r\ncastles? Few underground prisons? Few wells? Few ropes and halters for\r\nthe neck?\"\r\n\r\n\"For the living God's sake!\" exclaimed Macko.\r\n\r\n\"God grant that they may not also detain the young lord, although he went\r\nthere with a letter from the prince, and accompanied by de Lorche who is\r\na powerful lord and related to the prince. Ah, I did not want to set out\r\nfor this place. But he commanded me to go. I heard him once say to the\r\nold lord of Spychow: 'It is to be regretted that you are not cunning, for\r\nI shall get nothing by craft, and with them that is a necessary thing. O\r\nUncle Macko! he would be useful here;' and for that reason he dispatched\r\nme. But as for Jurandowna, even you, sir, will not find her, for probably\r\nshe is already in the other world, and where death is concerned, even the\r\ngreatest cunning cannot prevail.\"\r\n\r\nMacko was absorbed in thought for a long while, after which he said:\r\n\r\n\"Ha! Then there is no counsel. Cunning cannot prevail against death. But\r\nif I were to go there and only get assurance that she has been removed,\r\nthen in that case Spychow as well as Zbyszko remain. He will be able to\r\nreturn here and marry another maiden.\"\r\n\r\nHere Macko breathed freely, as though a burden were removed from his\r\nheart, and Glowacz asked in a bashful, subdued voice:\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean the young lady of Zgorzelice?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well!\" replied Macko, \"especially as she is an orphan, and Cztan of\r\nRogow and Wilk of Brzozowa continually press their court to her.\"\r\n\r\nAt that the Bohemian straightened himself up.\r\n\r\n\"Is the young lady an orphan?... The knight Zych?...\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you do not know.\"\r\n\r\n\"For the love of God! What has happened?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well you are right. How could you know, since you have just arrived; and\r\nour only conversation has been about Zbyszko. She is an orphan. Unless he\r\nhad guests, Zych of Zgorzelice never remained at home; otherwise he\r\navoided Zgorzelice. He wrote about you to his abbot that he was going to\r\nvisit Prince Przemka of Oswiecemia and ask him to give you to him. Zych\r\ndid it because he was well acquainted with the prince and they have often\r\nfrolicked together. Consequently Zych called upon me and said as follows:\r\n'I am going to Oswiecemia, then to Glewic; keep your eye on Zgorzelice.'\r\nI at once suspected something wrong and said: 'Don't go! I will keep good\r\nwatch over Jagienka and the estate,' for I know that Cztan and Wilk\r\nintend to do you some wrong, and you ought to know that the abbot out of\r\nspite against Zbyszko, preferred Cztan or Wilk for the girl. But he\r\nsubsequently learned to know them better and rejected both of them, and\r\nturned them out of Zgorzelice; but not effectually, for they obstinately\r\npersisted. Now they have quieted down for a while, for they have wounded\r\neach other and are laid up, but before that occurred there was not a\r\nmoment of security. Everything is upon my head, protection and\r\nguardianship. Now Zbyszko wishes me to come.... What will happen here to\r\nJagienka--I don't know, but now I will tell you about Zych; he did not\r\nfollow my advice--he went. Well, they feasted and frolicked together.\r\nFrom Glewic they went to see old Nosak, Prince Przemka's father, who\r\nrules in Cieszyn; till Jasko, the prince of Racibor, out of hatred for\r\nPrince Przemka, set upon them the robber band under the leadership of the\r\nBohemian Chrzan; Prince Przemka and Zych of Zgorzelice perished in the\r\naffray. The robbers stunned the abbot with an iron flail, so that even\r\nnow his head shakes and he knows nothing of what is going on in the world\r\nand has lost his speech, God help him, forever! Now old Prince Nosak\r\nbought Chrzan from the owner of Zampach, and tortured him so much that\r\neven the oldest inhabitants never heard of such cruelty,--but the cruelty\r\ndid not lessen the sorrow of the old man for his son; neither did it\r\nresuscitate Zych, nor wipe away the tears of Jagienka. This is the result\r\nof the frolic.... Six weeks ago they brought Zych here and buried him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Such a hard master!...\" sorrowfully said the Bohemian. \"Under Boleslaw I\r\nwas comfortably situated when he took me into captivity. But such was the\r\ncaptivity that I would not have exchanged it for freedom.... He was a\r\ngood and worthy master! May God grant him eternal glory. Ah, I am very\r\nsorry! But I must grieve for the helpless young lady.\"\r\n\r\n\"Because the poor thing is a good girl, she loved her father more than a\r\nman loves his mother. Then too she is not safe in Zgorzelice. After the\r\nfuneral, scarcely had the snow covered Zych's grave, when Cztan and Wilk\r\nstepped into the mansion of Zgorzelice. My people were informed of it\r\nbeforehand. Then I, with the farm hands went to the rescue; we arrived in\r\ngood time and with God's help we gave them a good thrashing. Immediately\r\nafter the fight, the girl fell on her knees and begged me to save her.\r\n'If I cannot belong to Zbyszko,' she said, 'I will belong to nobody else;\r\nonly save me from those torturers, I prefer death to them....' I tell you\r\nthat I made a real castle out of Zgorzelice. After that, they appeared\r\ntwice on the premises, but believe me, they could not succeed. Now there\r\nwill be peace for some time, for as I told you: they hurt each other\r\nbadly, so much so, that neither is able to move head or foot.\"\r\n\r\nGlowacz made no observation upon this, but when he heard of the conduct\r\nof Cztan and Wilk, he began to gnash his teeth so loudly, that it sounded\r\nlike the creaking caused by the opening and closing of a door, then he\r\nbegan to rub his strong hands upon his thighs as though they were\r\nitching. Finally, he uttered with difficulty only one word:\r\n\r\n\"Villains!\"\r\n\r\nBut at that moment, a voice was heard in the entrance-hall, the door\r\nsuddenly opened and Jagienka rushed into the house, and with her was\r\nJasko, her oldest brother, who was fourteen years old and looked as like\r\nher, as though they were twins.\r\n\r\nShe had heard from some peasants at Zgorzelice, that they had seen the\r\nBohemian Hlawa, at the head of some people, journeying to Bogdaniec, and\r\nlike Macko, she also was terrified, and when they informed her that\r\nZbyszko was not among them she was almost sure that some misfortune had\r\nhappened. She therefore lost no time and hastened to Bogdaniec to\r\nascertain the truth.\r\n\r\n\"What has happened?... For God's sake tell me,\" she shouted, when yet\r\nupon the threshold.\r\n\r\n\"What should happen?\" replied Macko. \"Zbyszko is alive and well.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bohemian hastened toward the young lady, knelt upon one knee and\r\nkissed the hem of her dress, but she paid no attention to it; only when\r\nshe heard the reply of the old knight she turned her head from the\r\nfireplace to the darker side of the room, and only after a while, as if\r\nhaving forgotten that it was necessary to salute the Bohemian, she said:\r\n\r\n\"The name of Jesus Christ be praised!\"\r\n\r\n\"Forever and ever,\" replied Macko.\r\n\r\nThen she observed the kneeling Bohemian at her feet and bent toward him.\r\n\r\n\"From my soul I am glad to see you, Hlawa, but why did you leave your\r\nmaster behind?\"\r\n\r\n\"He sent me away, most gracious lady.\"\r\n\r\n\"What were his orders?\"\r\n\r\n\"He ordered me to go to Bogdaniec.\"\r\n\r\n\"To Bogdaniec?... What else?\"\r\n\r\n\"He sent me to get counsel.... He also sends his compliments and good\r\nwishes.\"\r\n\r\n\"To Bogdaniec? Very well, then. But where is he himself?\"\r\n\r\n\"He left for Malborg, and is now among the Knights of the Cross.\"\r\n\r\nJagienka's face again assumed an expression of alarm.\r\n\r\n\"Why, is he tired of life?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is in quest, gracious lady, of that which he will not be able to\r\nfind.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe he will not find it,\" interrupted Macko. \"Just as one cannot\r\ndrive a nail without a hammer, so are man's wishes without the will of\r\nGod.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" cried Jagienka. But Macko replied with\r\nanother query.\r\n\r\n\"Did he say to you that Zbyszko went for Jurandowna? It seems to me that\r\nhe did.\"\r\n\r\nJagienka at first did not reply, and only after awhile, catching her\r\nbreath, she replied:\r\n\r\n\"Ay! He said! But what hindered him telling?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, now I can talk freely.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he began to tell to her all that he had heard from the Bohemian. He\r\nwondered at himself why his words came haltingly and with difficulty, but\r\nbeing a clever man, he tried to avoid any expression that might irritate\r\nJagienka, and he dwelt strongly upon what he himself believed, that\r\nZbyszko was never the husband of Danusia in reality and that she was\r\nalready lost to him forever.\r\n\r\nThe Bohemian confirmed Macko's words now and then, sometimes by nodding\r\nhis head in approval, sometimes repeating \"By God, true, as I live,\" or:\r\n\"It is so, not otherwise!\" The young lady listened, with eyelashes\r\nlowered till they touched her cheeks; she asked no more questions, and\r\nwas so quiet that her silence alarmed Macko.\r\n\r\n\"Now, what do you say to that?\" he enquired when he had ended.\r\n\r\nBut she did not reply, only two tears glistened between her eyelids and\r\nrolled down her cheeks.\r\n\r\nAfter a while she approached Macko, and kissing his hand, said:\r\n\r\n\"The Lord be praised.\"\r\n\r\n\"Forever and ever,\" replied Macko. \"Are you so much needed at home?\r\nBetter stay with us.\"\r\n\r\nBut she refused to remain, giving as a reason that she had not given out\r\nthe provisions for supper. But Macko, although he knew that there was the\r\nold lady, Sieciechowa, at Zgorzelice, who could easily fulfil Jagienka's\r\nduties, did not persuade her to remain, for he knew that sorrow does not\r\nlike the light on human tears, and that a man is like a fish, when it\r\nfeels the penetrating harpoon in its body it sinks to the depths.\r\n\r\nThen he only regarded her as a girl, so he led her and the Bohemian into\r\nthe courtyard.\r\n\r\nBut the Bohemian brought the horse from the stable, harnessed him, and\r\ndeparted with the young lady.\r\n\r\nBut Macko returned to the house, shook his head, and murmured:\r\n\r\n\"What a fool that Zbyszko is?... Why, her presence seems to have filled\r\nthe whole house with perfume.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man lamented to himself. \"Had Zbyszko taken her immediately after\r\nhe returned, by this time there might have been joy and delight! But what\r\nof it now? If they should speak of him her eyes would immediately be\r\nfilled with tears of longing, and the fellow is roaming about the world\r\nand may break the head of some of the knights at Malborg, provided they\r\ndo not break his; and now the house is empty, only the arms on the wall\r\nglitter. There is some benefit in husbandry. Running about is nothing,\r\nSpychow and Bogdaniec are nothing. Very soon none will remain to whom\r\nthey might be left.\"\r\n\r\nHere Macko became angry.\r\n\r\n\"Wait, you tramp,\" he exclaimed, \"I will not go with you, you may do as\r\nyou like!\"\r\n\r\nBut at that very moment he was seized with an exceeding yearning after\r\nZbyszko.\r\n\r\n\"Bah! shall I not go,\" he thought. \"Shall I remain at home? God\r\nforbid!... I wish to see that rascal once more. It must be so. He will\r\nagain fight one of those dog-brothers--and take spoil. Others grow old\r\nbefore they receive the belt of knighthood, but he already has received\r\nthe belt from the prince.... And rightly so. There are many valorous\r\nyouths among the nobility; but not another like him.\"\r\n\r\nHis tender feelings entirely subdued him. First he began to look at the\r\narms, swords and axes which had become blackened by the smoke, as though\r\nconsidering which to take with him, and which to leave behind; then he\r\nleft the house; first, because he could not stay there; secondly, to give\r\norders to prepare the carriage and give the horses double provender.\r\n\r\nIn the courtyard where it was already beginning to grow dark, he\r\nremembered Jagienka, who only a moment ago sat here on horseback, and he\r\nagain became uneasy.\r\n\r\n\"I must go,\" he said to himself, \"but who is going to protect the girl\r\nagainst Cztan and Wilk. May thunder strike them.\"\r\n\r\nBut Jagienka was on the road with her little brother, Jasko, crossing the\r\nwoods leading to Zgorzelice, and the Bohemian accompanied them in\r\nsilence, with love and grief in his heart. A moment since he saw her\r\ntears, now he looked at her dark form, scarcely visible in the darkness\r\nof the forest, and he guessed her sorrow and pain. It also seemed to him\r\nthat at any moment Wilk or Cztan's rapacious hands might dart from the\r\ndark thicket and grasp her, and at that thought, he was carried away by\r\nwild anger and longed for a fight. At times the desire for fight was so\r\nintense that he wanted to grasp his axe or sword and cut down a pine tree\r\non the road. He felt that a good fight would comfort him. Lastly he would\r\nbe glad, even if he could let the horse go at a gallop. But he could not\r\ndo it, they rode silently in front of him, and at a very slow gait, foot\r\nby foot, and little Jasko, who was of a talkative disposition, after\r\nseveral attempts to engage his sister in conversation, seeing that she\r\nwas unwilling to speak, desisted, and also sank into deep silence.\r\n\r\nBut when they were approaching Zgorzelice, the sorrow in the Bohemian's\r\nheart turned to anger against Cztan and Wilk: \"I would not spare even my\r\nblood in your behalf,\" he said to himself, \"provided it comforted you.\r\nBut what can I, unfortunate, do? What can I tell you? Unless I tell you\r\nthat he ordered me to kneel before you. And, God grant that that might be\r\nof some comfort to you.\"\r\n\r\nThinking thus, he urged his horse close to Jagienka's.\r\n\r\n\"Gracious lady....\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you riding with us?\" enquired Jagienka, as though awaking from\r\nsleep. \"What do you say?\"\r\n\r\n\"I forgot to tell you what my master commanded me to say to you. When I\r\nwas about to depart from Spychow, he called me and said 'I bow at the\r\nfeet of the young lady of Zgorzelice, for whether in good or bad fortune,\r\nI shall never forget her; and for what she did for my uncle and myself,\r\nmay God recompense her, and keep her in good health.'\"\r\n\r\n\"May God also recompense him for his good words,\" replied Jagienka.\r\n\r\nThen she added, in such a wonderful tone, that it caused the Bohemian's\r\nheart to melt:\r\n\r\n\"And you, Hlawa.\"\r\n\r\nThe conversation ceased for a while. But the armor-bearer was glad for\r\nhimself and for her words. For he said to himself: \"At least it shall not\r\nbe said that she has been fed with ingratitude.\" He also began to rack\r\nhis brains for something more of the same nature to tell her; and after a\r\nmoment he said:\r\n\r\n\"Lady.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"This ... as it were ... I want to say, as the old _pan_ of Bogdaniec\r\nalso said: 'That the lady there is lost forever, and that he will never\r\nfind her, even if the grand master himself assist him.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Then she is his wife....\"\r\n\r\nThe Bohemian nodded his head.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, she is his wife.\"\r\n\r\nJagienka made no reply to this, but at home, after supper, when Jasko and\r\nthe younger brother were put to bed, she ordered a pitcher of mead. Then\r\nshe turned to the Bohemian and asked:\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you want to retire. I wish to continue our conversation.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bohemian, although tired, was ready to chatter even till morning. So\r\nthey began to talk, and he again related in general terms all that had\r\nhappened to Zbyszko, Jurand, Danusia and himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nMacko prepared for his journey, and Jagienka did not show herself at\r\nBogdaniec for two days after her consultation with the Bohemian. It was\r\nonly on the third day that the old knight met her on his way to church.\r\nShe was riding with her brother Jasiek to church at Krzesnia, and with\r\nher was a considerable number of armed servants in order to protect her\r\nfrom Cztan and Wilk, because she was not sure whether Cztan and Wilk were\r\nstill sick or were planning to harm her.\r\n\r\n\"Any way, I intended to call upon our own people at Bogdaniec,\" she said,\r\ngreeting Macko, \"because I have to consult you about a very important\r\naffair, but since you are here we can talk about it now.\"\r\n\r\nThen she advanced in front of the retinue, obviously to prevent the\r\nservants overhearing their conversation. When Macko was near her she\r\ninquired:\r\n\r\n\"Are you surely going?\"\r\n\r\n\"If God will, not later than to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you going to Malborg?\"\r\n\r\n\"To Malborg, or any other place, according to circumstances.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now then listen to me. I have thought a long time about what I ought to\r\ndo. I want to ask your advice, too. You well know that as long as papa\r\nwas alive, and the abbot was powerful, it was quite different. Cztan and\r\nWilk also thought that I should choose one of them, so they kept their\r\ntemper. But now I stand alone without a protector; then either I shall\r\nremain at Zgorzelice in a fortress, like a prisoner, or they will do us\r\nsome harm without fail. Is it not so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Macko, \"I thought of it myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what did you devise?\"\r\n\r\n\"I devised nothing, but I must tell you one thing, that we are in Poland\r\nand the law of this country punishes severely those who are guilty of\r\nacts of violence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, but the transgressors have no difficulty in crossing the\r\nfrontier. Indeed, I know that Szlonsk is also in Poland, yet there the\r\nprinces themselves quarrel and attack each other. If it were not so, my\r\nbeloved father would still be alive. There are already Germans there and\r\nthe times are stormy; they are mischievous, so that if any one of them\r\nwishes to conceal himself, he does. It would be easy for me to avoid\r\nCztan and Wilk, but it concerns my little brother. If I should be absent\r\nthere would be peace, but if I remained in Zgorzelice, God only knows\r\nwhat ill luck might happen. There would be outrages and fights; and\r\nJasiek is already fourteen years old, and nobody, not even myself, can\r\ndetain him. Upon the last occasion when you came to our assistance he\r\nflew to the front, and when Cztan used his club upon the crowd he nearly\r\nhit him on the head. 'O,' Jasko said to the servants, 'those two I will\r\nprosecute to the very end.' I tell you that there will not be a single\r\npeaceful day and some evil might befall the youngster.\"\r\n\r\n\"Faith. Cztan and Wilk are dog-brothers,\" said Macko, \"although they\r\nwould not dare lift up their hands against children. Bah! only a Knight\r\nof the Cross would do that.\"\r\n\r\n\"They will not lift up their hands against children, but in case of\r\ntumult, or, God forbid, in an incendiary fire, there will be no lack of\r\naccidents. Why talk! I love the brother of old Sieciechowa as my own\r\nparents, and protection for them from the dear old woman is not wanting,\r\nyet, without me ... would they be safer without me?\"\r\n\r\n\"May be,\" replied Macko.\r\n\r\nThen he looked slyly at the girl.\r\n\r\n\"Then, what do you want?\"\r\n\r\nAnd she replied in a low tone:\r\n\r\n\"Take me with you.\"\r\n\r\nThen Macko, although he easily understood the drift of the conversation,\r\nwas much surprised. He checked his horse, and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Fear God, Jagienka.\"\r\n\r\nBut she dropped her head and replied bashfully and sadly:\r\n\r\n\"You may think so, but as far as myself is concerned, I would rather\r\nspeak out than be silent. Hlawa and yourself said that Zbyszko will never\r\nfind Danusia, and the Bohemian's hope of finding her is even less. God is\r\nmy witness that I do not wish her evil in the least. Let the mother of\r\nGod watch over that poor girl and keep her. Zbyszko loved her more than\r\nmyself. Well, I cannot help it. Such is my lot. But observe this, so long\r\nas Zbyszko does not find her, or as you believe, he will never find her,\r\nthen, then ...\"\r\n\r\n\"What then?\" asked Macko, seeing that the girl was getting more and more\r\nconfused and stammering.\r\n\r\n\"Then I do not wish to be Madame Cztan, nor Madame Wilk, nor madame\r\nanybody.\"\r\n\r\nMacko breathed freely.\r\n\r\n\"I thought that you had already forgiven him.\"\r\n\r\nBut she, still in a sad tone, replied: \"Ah!...\"\r\n\r\n\"Then what are your wishes? How can we take you among the Knights of the\r\nCross?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not exactly among the Knights of the Cross, I should like to be now with\r\nthe abbot who is confined in the hospital at Sieradz. He has not a single\r\nfriendly soul with him. The servants care more for the pitcher than they\r\ndo for him. Moreover, he is my godfather and benefactor. If he were well\r\nI would have sought his protection all the same because the people fear\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall not dispute that,\" said Macko, who as a matter of fact, would be\r\nglad that Jagienka should not go with him, for he well knew the Knights\r\nof the Cross, and he was thoroughly convinced that Danuska would never\r\ncome out alive from their hands. \"But only this I tell you, that to\r\ntravel with a girl is very troublesome.\"\r\n\r\n\"May be with others, but not with me. Nothing has occurred to me so far,\r\nbut I am accustomed to go about with the bow and can endure hardship in\r\nthe chase. When it is necessary, it is necessary. Don't be afraid. I\r\nshall take Jasiek's clothing and a net for my hair and I shall go.\r\nJasiek, although younger than I am, with the exception of his hair looks\r\nexactly like myself, so much so that when we disguised ourselves last\r\ncarnival our departed father could not tell one from the other. Observe,\r\nneither the abbot nor anybody else recognized me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither Zbyszko?\"\r\n\r\n\"If I shall see him....\"\r\n\r\nMacko thought for a moment, then suddenly smiled and said:\r\n\r\n\"But Wilk of Brzozowa and Cztan of Rogow would be furious.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let them! It might be worse if they came after us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well! Fear not. I am an old man, but let them beware of my fist. All the\r\nGradys are of the same mettle!... However, they have already tested\r\nZbyszko....\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile they arrived at Krzesnia. Old Wilk of Brzozowa, who also\r\nhappened to be at church, from time to time cast gloomy glances at Macko,\r\nbut he did not mind it, and with a light heart he returned with Jagienka\r\nimmediately after mass.... Then they took leave of each other and parted.\r\nWhen Macko was by himself at Bogdaniec, less happy thoughts passed\r\nthrough his mind. He understood that neither the people at Zgorzelice nor\r\nthe relatives of Jagienka would really object to her departure. \"But as\r\nto the girl's admirers,\" he said to himself, \"that is quite another\r\naffair, but against the orphans and their property they would not dare to\r\nlift up their hand, because they would cover themselves with excessive\r\ninfamy. Everybody would be against them as one is against a wolf. But\r\nBogdaniec is left to God's favor!... The quarries will be filled up, the\r\nflocks will be seized, the peasants will be enticed away!... If God\r\npermit me to return, then I will fight them. I shall send out bans, and\r\nfight them not with the fist but with the law!... Only let me return, and\r\nif I do?... They will combine against me, because I have spoiled their\r\nlove affair, and if she goes with me they will yet be more rancorous.\"\r\n\r\nHe was much grieved about his estate at Bogdaniec which he had improved.\r\nNow he felt sure that on his return he would find it desolate and in\r\nruins.\r\n\r\n\"Now then, it is necessary to take counsel,\" he thought.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, after dinner, he ordered his horse to be saddled and left\r\ndirectly for Brzozowa.\r\n\r\nIt was already dark when he arrived. Old Wilk was sitting in the front\r\nroom drinking mead from a pitcher. Young Wilk, who was wounded by Cztan,\r\nwas lying on a skin-covered bench, and was also drinking mead. Macko\r\nentered unexpectedly and remained standing upon the threshold with a\r\nstern look on his face; tall, bony, armed only with a big sabre at his\r\nside. They recognized him at once, because his face was lit up by the\r\nbright flame of the fireplace, and at the first moment, both the father\r\nand son jumped up, lightning-like, and running toward the wall seized the\r\nfirst arms that were at hand.\r\n\r\nBut the old experienced Macko, well knowing the people and their customs,\r\ndid not interfere in the least, he did not even reach his hand to his\r\nsword. He only put his hands on his hips, and said quietly in a somewhat\r\nsarcastic voice:\r\n\r\n\"How is it? Is this the kind of hospitality which the nobles in Brzozowa\r\npractice?\"\r\n\r\nThese words had the desired effect; their hands fell, and in a moment the\r\nold man let fall the sword with a clash, the young man dropped his pike,\r\nand they stood with their necks craned toward Macko, their faces still\r\nexpressing hatred, but already amazed and ashamed of themselves.\r\n\r\nMacko smiled and said:\r\n\r\n\"May the name of Christ be praised!\"\r\n\r\n\"Forever and ever.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Saint Jerzy.\"\r\n\r\n\"We serve him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I come to visit my neighbors with good will.\"\r\n\r\n\"With good will we greet you, the guest of his holy person.\"\r\n\r\nThen old Wilk rushed toward Macko, and with his son, both of them pressed\r\nhis right hand, they made him sit at a comfortable place at the table; in\r\na second they threw another log on the fireplace, spread the table and\r\nput upon it a dish full of food, a jug of beer, a pitcher of mead, and\r\nbegan to eat and drink. Young Wilk glanced now and then at Macko, which,\r\nhappily for the guest, contributed to lessen his hatred against him. But\r\nhe served him, however, so diligently that he became pale from fatigue,\r\nbecause he was wounded and deprived of his wonted strength. The father\r\nand son burned with curiosity to know the object of Macko's call. None,\r\nhowever, asked him why, but waited for him to speak.\r\n\r\nBut Macko, as a man of manners, praised the meat, drink and hospitality.\r\nOnly when he had filled himself well, he looked up and spoke with\r\ndignity:\r\n\r\n\"People often quarrel. But neighborly peace above all.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is not a better thing than peace,\" replied old Wilk, with equal\r\ncomposure.\r\n\r\n\"It also often happens,\" said Macko, \"when one wants to undertake a long\r\njourney, he wants to make up and bid good-bye even to his adversaries.\"\r\n\r\n\"God reward you for your candid words.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not mere words, but deeds, for I actually came to wish you good-bye.\"\r\n\r\n\"From our soul we wish you might visit us daily.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish I could feast you in Bogdaniec in a manner suitable to people who\r\nare acquainted with knightly honor. But I am in a hurry to go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it to war, or to some holy place?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should like to go to one of the two, but the place I am going to is\r\nworse, for I am going among the Knights of the Cross.\"\r\n\r\n\"Among the Knights of the Cross,\" exclaimed both father and son.\r\n\r\n\"Yes!\" replied Macko. \"And one who is their enemy is going to them. It is\r\nwell for him to be reconciled with God and men, so that he may not\r\nforfeit, not only his life, but everlasting salvation.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is wonderful,\" said old Wilk. \"I have never yet seen any man who has\r\nnot suffered from their wrongs and oppression.\"\r\n\r\n\"So it is in the whole fatherland,\" added Macko. \"Neither Lithuania\r\nbefore its conversion to Christianity, nor even the Tartars were such a\r\nburden to the Polish kingdom as those devilish monks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite true, but this you also know, they gathered and gathered. It is\r\ntime now to finish with them.\"\r\n\r\nThen the old man spat in his hands, and young Wilk added:\r\n\r\n\"It cannot be otherwise now.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will come to pass, surely, but when? We cannot do it, it is the\r\nking's affair. It may be soon or not ... God only knows. But meanwhile I\r\nmust go to them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it not with ransom for Zbyszko?\"\r\n\r\nAs his father mentioned Zbyszko's name young Wilk's face became pale with\r\nhatred.\r\n\r\nBut Macko replied quietly:\r\n\r\n\"May be with ransom but not for Zbyszko.\"\r\n\r\nThese words intensified the curiosity of both lords of Brzozowa. Old\r\nWilk, who could no more contain himself, said:\r\n\r\n\"Can you tell us, or not, the reason for your going there?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will tell you! I will!\" he said, nodding assent, \"but first let me\r\ntell you something else. Take notice then. After my departure Bogdaniec\r\nwill be under God's care.... When Zbyszko and myself were fighting under\r\nPrince Witold, the abbot, also Zych of Zgorzelice, looked somewhat after\r\nour small property. Now we shall miss even that little. It pains me\r\nterribly to think that my endeavor and labor will be in vain.... You can\r\nwell form an idea how much this troubles me. They will entice away my\r\npeople, plough up the boundaries; they will take away my herds. Even\r\nshould God permit me to return, I shall find my property ruined.... There\r\nis only one remedy, only one help ... good neighbor. For this reason I\r\ncame to ask you as a neighbor that you would take Bogdaniec under your\r\nprotection and see that no harm is done.\"\r\n\r\nListening to Macko's request, old Wilk and his son exchanged looks; both\r\nof them were amazed beyond measure. They were silent for a moment, and\r\nneither could muster courage enough to reply. But Macko lifted another\r\ncup of mead to his mouth, drank it, then continued his conversation in as\r\nquiet and confiding a manner as though the two had been his most intimate\r\nfriends for years.\r\n\r\n\"I have told you candidly from whom most damage is expected. It is from\r\nno other quarter but from Cztan of Rogow. Although we were hostile to\r\neach other, I fear nothing from you because you are noble people who\r\nwould face your adversaries, yet would not revenge yourselves by acting\r\nmeanly. You are quite different. A knight is always a knight. But Cztan\r\nis a _prestak_ (churl). From such a fellow anything might be expected, as\r\nyou know. He is very bitter against me because I spoiled his game with\r\nJagienka.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whom you reserve for your nephew,\" burst out young Wilk.\r\n\r\nMacko looked at him and held him under his cold gaze for a moment, then\r\nhe turned to the old man and said quietly:\r\n\r\n\"You know, my nephew married a rich Mazovian proprietress and took\r\nconsiderable dower.\" Silence more profound than before again reigned for\r\na while. Both father and son gazed at Macko with their mouths wide open,\r\nfor some time.\r\n\r\nFinally the old man said:\r\n\r\n\"O! how is that? Tell us....\"\r\n\r\nMacko appeared not to notice the question and continued:\r\n\r\n\"This is the very reason why I must go, and why I also ask you, as worthy\r\nand upright neighbors, to take care of Bogdaniec when I go, and see to it\r\nthat nobody damages my property. Have your eye especially upon Cztan and\r\nprotect me against him.\"\r\n\r\nDuring that time young Wilk, who was quick to understand, reflected that\r\nsince Zbyszko had got married it would be better to be in friendship with\r\nMacko, because Jagienka confided in him, and did nothing without asking\r\nhis advice. Thus new prospects suddenly presented themselves before his\r\neyes. \"It is not enough, we must not only not oppose Macko, but endeavor\r\nto be reconciled with him,\" he said to himself. Therefore, although he\r\nwas somewhat under the influence of drink, he quickly stretched his hand\r\nunder the table and grasped his father's knee and pressed it vigorously\r\nas a sign for his father to be careful in his speech, but said himself:\r\n\r\n\"Ay! we do not fear Cztan! Let him only try. He wounded me with the\r\nplatter, true, but I too have given him such a sound drubbing that his\r\nown mother could not recognize him. Fear nothing! Be at your ease. Not\r\neven one crow shall be lost at Bogdaniec!\"\r\n\r\n\"I see you are upright people. Do you promise me?\"\r\n\r\n\"We promise!\" both exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Upon your knightly honor?\"\r\n\r\n\"Upon knightly honor.\"\r\n\r\n\"And upon your escutcheon?\"\r\n\r\n\"Upon the escutcheon; yea, upon the cross too. So help us God!\"\r\n\r\nMacko smiled with satisfaction, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Well, this is now with you, and I am confident you will do it. If so,\r\nlet me tell you something more. Zych, as you know, appointed me guardian\r\nof his children. I have, therefore, spoiled both Cztan's incursions and\r\nyour young man at Zgorzelice. But now when I arrive at Malborg, or, God\r\nknows where, what then will become of my guardianship?... It is true,\r\nthat God is a father of the fatherless; and woe to him who shall attempt\r\nto harm her; not only will I chop off his head with an axe, but also\r\nproclaim him an infamous scoundrel. Nevertheless I feel very sorry to\r\npart, sorry indeed. Then promise me I pray, that you will not only\r\nyourself not do any harm to Zych's orphans, but see too that others do\r\nnot harm them.\"\r\n\r\n\"We swear! We swear!\"\r\n\r\n\"Upon your knightly honor and your escutcheon?\"\r\n\r\n\"Upon knightly honor and escutcheon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Also upon the cross?\"\r\n\r\n\"Upon the cross too.\"\r\n\r\n\"God hears it. Amen,\" concluded Macko, and he breathed deeply, because he\r\nwas sure that they would not break such an oath. Even if they were\r\nprovoked they would rather gnaw their fists with anger than perjure\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThen he began to take leave, but they insisted upon his remaining. He was\r\nobliged to drink and fraternize with old Wilk. But young Wilk, contrary\r\nto his custom to look for quarrels when drunk, this time limited his\r\nanger to threats against Cztan, and ran around Macko so assiduously as\r\nthough he were to obtain Jagienka from Macko the following morning.\r\nToward midnight he fainted from over-exertion, and after they revived\r\nhim, he fell asleep like a log. Old Wilk followed the example of his son,\r\nso that when Macko left them they were lying under the table like\r\ncorpses. Yet Macko himself had an extraordinary head and was not so much\r\naffected by the drink, but was cheerful. When he returned home he\r\nreflected with joy upon what he had accomplished.\r\n\r\n\"Well!\" he said to himself, \"Bogdaniec is safe and so is Zgorzelice. They\r\nwill be raging when they hear of Jagienka's departure. But she and my\r\nproperty are safe. The Lord Jesus has endowed men with skill, so that\r\nwhen one cannot make use of his fist, he uses his mind. The old man will\r\nsurely challenge me when I return home, but it is not worth while to\r\nthink about it.... Would to God that I might entrap the Knights of the\r\nCross in such manner.... But it will be a difficult task with them. With\r\nus, even when one has an affair with a 'dog brother,' nevertheless if he\r\ntakes an oath on his knightly honor and escutcheon he will keep it. But\r\nwith them an oath has no value; it is like spitting upon the water. But\r\nmay the mother of Jesus assist me, that I may be as serviceable to\r\nZbyszko as I have been to Zychow's children, and Bogdaniec....\"\r\n\r\nHere, it crossed his mind, that perhaps it might be advisable not to take\r\nJagienka, because the two Wilks would care for her as the apple of their\r\neye. But the next moment he rejected that plan. \"The Wilks might care for\r\nher, true, but Cztan will persist in his attempts, and God knows who will\r\nprevail. But it is a sure thing that there will be a succession of fights\r\nand outrages from which Zgorzelice, Zych's orphans, and even the girl\r\nmight suffer. It will be an easy matter for Wilk to guard Bogdaniec. But\r\nby all means it will be better for the girl to be as far away from the\r\ntwo murderers as possible, and at the same time to be as near the rich\r\nabbot as possible. Macko firmly believed that Danusia would never be\r\nrescued from the Knights of the Cross, alive. And the hope that Zbyszko\r\nwould return home as a widower and most likely take to Jagienka, never\r\nleft him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! Mighty God!\" he said to himself. \"In such a case he will be the\r\nowner of Spychow, then he will get Jagienka and Moczydoly, and in\r\naddition to it he will acquire that which the abbot will bequeath. I\r\nwould not even spare him wax for candles.\"\r\n\r\nOccupied with such thoughts, the road from Brzozowa seemed to be\r\nshortened, yet he arrived at Bogdaniec after nightfall, and was surprised\r\nto see his windows brightly illuminated. The servants, too, were awake,\r\nfor he had scarcely entered the courtyard when the stable boy came\r\nrushing to him.\r\n\r\n\"Are there some guests?\" asked Macko, dismounting.\r\n\r\n\"There is the young gentleman of Zgorzelice with the Bohemian,\" replied\r\nthe stable boy.\r\n\r\nThis information astonished Macko, for Jagienka had promised to arrive\r\nnext day, very early, when they were to start immediately. Then, why had\r\nJasko come and that so late? It struck the old knight that something must\r\nhave occurred at Zgorzelice, and he entered his house with a certain\r\namount of anxiety. But within he found a bright fire burning in the large\r\nclay oven in the centre of the room. And upon the table were two iron\r\ncradles and two torches in them, by which light Macko observed Jasko, the\r\nBohemian, Hlawa, and another young servant with a face as red as an\r\napple.\r\n\r\n\"How are you, Jasko? and what is the matter with Jagienka?\" asked the old\r\nnobleman.\r\n\r\n\"Jagienka ordered me to tell you,\" he said, whilst kissing Macko's hand,\r\n\"that she has reconsidered the matter and she prefers to stay at home.\"\r\n\r\n\"For God's sake! What do you say? How? What has happened to her?\"\r\n\r\nBut the boy looked at him with his beautiful blue eyes and smiled.\r\n\r\n\"What are you prating about?\"\r\n\r\nBut at this moment, the Bohemian and the other boy also burst out\r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\n\"You see!\" exclaimed the disguised boy. \"Who could recognize me. You even\r\nhave failed to recognize me!\"\r\n\r\nThen Macko looked at the lovely figure carefully and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"In the name of the Father and Son! It is a true carnival! You also here,\r\ncroaking thing. Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes! Why? Those who are on the road have no time to lose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it not to-morrow at dawn, that you were to leave?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly! to-morrow at dawn, so that all may know. To-morrow they will\r\nthink at Zgorzelice that I am your guest, and they will not notice it\r\ntill the day after to-morrow. Sieciechowa and Jasiek know it. But Jasko\r\npromised, upon knightly honor, that he will tell only then, when the\r\npeople begin to be restless. How is it you did not recognize me?\"\r\n\r\nNow it was Macko's turn to laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Let me have a good look at you; you are an excessively fine boy!... and\r\nsingularly so. From such one might expect to raise a good breed.... I\r\njustly declare, if this fellow were, (pointing at himself) were not\r\nold,--well! But, even thus I tell you, keep off, girl, from creeping\r\nunder my eyes, stand back!...\"\r\n\r\nAnd he began to threaten her with his finger, but looked at her with much\r\npleasure. Because such a girl he never saw before. Upon her head she had\r\na silken red net, and a yellow jacket upon her body and the breeches\r\nample round her hips and tighter above them, of which one little leg was\r\nof the same color as the cap (net) upon her head, the other had longwise\r\nstripes, with a richly covered little sword at her side, smiling and\r\nbright like the dawn. Her face was so exquisite that he could not take\r\nhis eyes off her.\r\n\r\n\"My God!\" said the overjoyed Macko. \"She looks like some marvelous young\r\nlady or like a flower, or something else!\"\r\n\r\n\"And this one here--I am sure it must also be somebody in disguise?\"\r\n\r\n\"This is Sieciechowa,\" answered Jagienka. \"It would be improper for me to\r\nbe alone among you. How could I? Therefore I have taken Anulka[111] with\r\nme so that two courageous women will be of help and service. Her also,\r\nnobody can recognize.\"\r\n\r\n\"There, old woman, you have a marriage feast. One is bad enough, now\r\nthere will be two.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't tease.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not teasing, but everybody will recognize you and her, in the\r\ndaytime.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pray, and why?\"\r\n\r\n\"In order to go on their knees to you and to her also.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, give us peace!...\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall have it, I am not in a hurry. But will Cztan or Wilk let you\r\nhave peace? God knows. Do you know, birdie, where I have just been? Why,\r\nat Brzozowa.\"\r\n\r\n\"For God's sake! What are you saying?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is true as truth itself that the Wilks protect Bogdaniec and\r\nZgorzelice against Cztan. Well, it is an easy matter to challenge an\r\nenemy and fight him. But to make your enemy into a protector of your own\r\nproperty is a very difficult task.\"\r\n\r\nThen Macko related his adventures with the Wilks, how they had become\r\nreconciled to each other. How he had got advantage over them; to this she\r\nlistened with the greatest wonder, and when he concluded she said:\r\n\r\n\"The Lord Jesus did not stint you in craftiness, and I observe that you\r\nwill always be successful in your undertakings.\"\r\n\r\nBut Macko shook his head, as though he felt sorry.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, daughter! If that were so, you would have long ago become the lady\r\nof Bogdaniec!\"\r\n\r\nUpon hearing that, Jagienka looked at him with her lovely blue eyes for a\r\nmoment, then she approached him, and kissed his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Why do you kiss me?\" inquired the old knight.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing.... I only wish to bid you goodnight, because it is getting late\r\nand to-morrow we must get up early for our journey.\"\r\n\r\nShe then embraced Sieciechowa and left, and Macko led the Bohemian to his\r\nroom, where they stretched themselves upon aurochs' skins and both fell\r\nsound asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nAfter the destruction, conflagration and slaughter which the Knights of\r\nthe Cross had committed in 1331, at Sieradz, Casimir the Great rebuilt\r\nthe razed town. The place, however, was not exceedingly splendid and\r\ncould not keep pace with the other towns of the realm. But Jagienka, who\r\nhitherto had spent her time among the people of Zgorzelice and Krzesnia,\r\nwas beside herself with admiration and astonishment at the sight of the\r\nhouses, towers, town hall, and especially the churches; the wooden\r\nstructure at Krzesnia could not be compared with them. At first she lost\r\nher wonted resolution, so much so that she dared not talk aloud, and only\r\ninquired of Macko in a whisper about those wonderful things which dazzled\r\nher eyes. But when the old knight assured her that there was as much\r\ndifference between Sieradz and Krakow as there is between a firebrand and\r\nthe sun, she would not believe her own ears, because it appeared to her\r\nan impossibility that another city could be found in the world which\r\ncould be equal to Sieradz.\r\n\r\nThey were received in the cloister by the same shriveled old prior, who\r\nstill remembered in his childhood the butchery by the Knights of the\r\nCross, and who had previously received Zbyszko. The news of the abbot\r\noccasioned them sorrow and trouble; he lived in the cloister for a long\r\nwhile, but he left a fortnight before their arrival to visit his friend,\r\nthe bishop of Plock. He was constantly ill. He was generally conscious in\r\nthe morning; but toward the evening he lost his head, he stormed and he\r\nasked to put on a coat of mail, and challenged Prince John of Racibor.\r\nThe clergy were obliged to apply force to keep him in bed; that was not\r\naccomplished without considerable trouble and even much risk. About a\r\nfortnight ago he had entirely lost his reason, and in spite of his\r\nserious illness, he had given orders to be taken to Plock immediately.\r\n\r\n\"He said that he confided in nobody so much as in the bishop of Plock,\r\nand that he wished to receive the sacrament from him alone and leave his\r\ntestament with him. We opposed his journey as much as we could, for he\r\nwas very faint, and we feared that he would not survive even one mile's\r\njourney. But to oppose him was not an easy task. So the attendants\r\nprepared a wagon and carried him away. May God direct it to a happy\r\nissue.\"\r\n\r\n\"If he had died somewhere near Sieradz you would have heard of it,\" said\r\nMacko.\r\n\r\n\"We would have surely heard of it,\" replied the little old prior. \"We\r\ntherefore are of opinion that he did not die, and we think that he had\r\nnot yet when he reached Lenczyca. What may have happened beyond that\r\nplace, we are unable to tell. You will get information on the road if you\r\ngo after him.\"\r\n\r\nMacko felt uneasy when he received the tidings, and he went to take\r\ncounsel with Jagienka, who had already got information from the Bohemian\r\nwhither the abbot had gone.\r\n\r\n\"What is to be done?\" he asked her; \"and what are you going to do with\r\nyourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"Come to Plock, and I will go with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"To Plock!\" repeated Sieciechowa, in a piping voice.\r\n\r\n\"Look how things go! Is it as easy for you to go to Flock as to handle\r\nthe sickle?\"\r\n\r\n\"How can I and Sieciechowa return by ourselves? If I cannot continue my\r\njourney with you, it would have been preferable to have remained at home.\r\nDo you not think that Wilk and Cztan will be more obstinate in their\r\nintrigues against me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wilk will protect you against Cztan.\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear Wilk's protection as much as Cztan's open violence. I see that\r\nyou too are opposing me; if it were only simple opposition I should not\r\nmind it, but not when it is in earnest.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed Macko's opposition was not in earnest; on the contrary he\r\npreferred that Jagienka should accompany him, than return, so when he\r\nheard her words, he smiled and said:\r\n\r\n\"She has got rid of her petticoats, and now she wants reason too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Reason is only to be found in the head.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Plock is out of the way.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Bohemian said that it is not out of the way, but it is nearer to\r\nMalborg.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you have already consulted the Bohemian?\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely; moreover, he said: 'If the young lord got into trouble at\r\nMalborg, then we could get much help from Princess Alexandra, for she is\r\na relative of the king; besides that, being a personal friend of the\r\nKnights of the Cross, she has great influence among them.'\"\r\n\r\n\"It is true, as God is dear to me!\" exclaimed Macko. \"It is a fact well\r\nknown to all, that if she wished to give us a letter to the master we\r\ncould travel with perfect safety in all lands of the Knights of the\r\nCross. They love her because she loves them. That Bohemian boy is not a\r\nfool, his advice is good.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how much so!\" Sieciechowa exclaimed with warmth, lifting up her\r\nlittle eyes.\r\n\r\nMacko suddenly turned toward her and said:\r\n\r\n\"What do you want here?\"\r\n\r\nThe girl became much confused, lowered her eyelashes and blushed like a\r\nrose.\r\n\r\nHowever, Macko saw that there was no other remedy but to continue his\r\njourney and take both girls with him. This he much desired. The following\r\nmorning he took leave of the little old prior and then they continued\r\ntheir journey. Owing to the thawing of the snow and inundations they\r\nprogressed with greater difficulty than before. On the road they inquired\r\nafter the abbot, and they found many courts, and parsonages, where there\r\nwere none of the former, even inns, where he had remained for a night's\r\nlodging. It was quite easy to follow in his track, because he had\r\nlavishly distributed alms, bought missals, contributed to church bells\r\nand subscribed to funds for the repair of churches. Therefore every\r\nbeggar, sexton, yea even every priest they met remembered him with\r\ngratitude. They generally said: \"He traveled like an angel,\" and prayed\r\nfor his recovery, although here and there were heard more expressions of\r\napprehension that his everlasting rest was drawing nigh, than hopes of\r\ntemporary recovery. In some places he had taken supplies enough for two\r\nor three days. It seemed to Macko that most likely he would be able to\r\novertake him.\r\n\r\nYet Macko was mistaken in his calculations. The overflow of the rivers\r\nNer and Bzur prevented them from arriving at Lenczyca. They were obliged\r\nto take up their quarters for four days at a deserted inn, whose owner\r\napparently had fled on account of the threatening floods. The road\r\nleading from the inn to the town which to a certain extent was repaired\r\nwith stumps of trees was submerged for a considerable stretch in the\r\nmuddy flood. Macko's servant, Wit, a native of that locality, had some\r\nknowledge of the road leading through the woods, but he refused to act as\r\nguide, because he knew that the marshes of Lenczyca were the rendezvous\r\nof unclean spirits, especially the powerful Borut who delighted in\r\nleading people to bottomless swamps, whence escape was only possible by\r\nforfeiture of the soul. Even the inn itself was held in bad repute, so\r\nthat travelers used to provision themselves with victuals to avoid\r\nhunger. Even old Macko was scared of this place. During the night they\r\nheard skirmishing upon the roof of the inn; at times there were also\r\nrappings at the door. Jagienka and Sieciechowa, who slept in the alcove\r\nnear the large room, also heard the sound of little footsteps upon the\r\nceiling and walls during the night-time. They were apparently not afraid\r\nof it, because at Zgorzelice they were accustomed to croaking birds. Old\r\nZych, in his time, fed them, according to the then prevailing custom\r\nthere were not wanting those who would provide them with crusts, and they\r\nwere not mischievous. But on a certain night, from the neighboring\r\nthickets resounded a dull ominous bellowing, and the following morning\r\nthey discovered huge cloven-foot traces upon the mud. They might have\r\nbeen of aurochs or bison, but Wit was of opinion that the traces were\r\nthose of Borut, and although his outward appearance is that of a man,\r\neven of a nobleman, he has cloven instead of human feet. But owing to\r\nparsimony he takes off his boots when crossing the swamps. Macko was\r\ninformed that one could appease him with drink; he considered during the\r\nwhole day whether it would be sinful to gain the friendship of the evil\r\nspirit. He even took counsel with Jagienka on the same subject.\r\n\r\n\"I should like to suspend upon the fence a bull's bladder full of wine or\r\nmead,\" he said, \"and if it were found that something of the drink were\r\nmissing, then it would be conclusive proof that the evil spirit was\r\npresent.\"\r\n\r\n\"But that might displease the heavenly powers,\" replied Jagienka, \"of\r\nwhose blessing we stand in need to assist us in succoring Zbyszko\r\nsuccessfully.\"\r\n\r\n\"I, too, am afraid, but I think that a little mead is not the soul. I\r\nshall not give him my soul. One bladder full of wine or mead, I think, is\r\nof little significance in the eyes of the heavenly powers!\"\r\n\r\nThen he lowered his voice and added:\r\n\r\n\"One nobleman entertains another even if he is a useless fellow, and they\r\nsay he is a nobleman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who?\" asked Jagienka.\r\n\r\n\"I do not want to mention the name of the unclean spirit.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Macko, with his own hands suspended the same evening a\r\nlarge bull's bladder in which drink is usually carried, and it was found\r\nempty the following morning.\r\n\r\nWhen that was related to the Bohemian, he laughed heartily, but nobody\r\npaid attention to it. Macko, however, was filled with joy, because he\r\nexpected that when he should attempt to cross the swamp no mishap would\r\noccur on that account.\r\n\r\n\"Unless they told an untruth when they said that he knows honor,\" he said\r\nto himself.\r\n\r\nAbove all things it was necessary to investigate if there was a passage\r\nthrough the woods. It might have been so, because where the soil was made\r\nfirm by the roots of the trees and other growths, it did not easily\r\nsoften by the rains; although Wit, who belonged in the locality, could\r\nbest perform that service, he refused to go, and when his name was\r\nsuggested, he shouted: \"Better kill me. I shall not go.\"\r\n\r\nThen they explained to him that the unclean spirits are powerless during\r\nthe daytime. Macko himself was willing to go, but it was finally arranged\r\nthat Hlawa should venture, because he was a bold fellow, agreeable to\r\nall, specially to the ladies. He put an axe in his belt, and in his hand\r\na scythe, and left.\r\n\r\nHe left early in the morning and was expected to return about noon, but\r\nhe did not, and they began to be alarmed. Later on, the servants were\r\nwatching at the edge of the forest, and in the afternoon Wit waved his\r\nhand as a sign that Hlawa had not returned, and should he return the\r\ndanger is greater for us, for God knows whether, owing to a wolf's bite,\r\nhe is not transformed into a werewolf. Hearing this, all were frightened;\r\neven Macko was not himself. Jagienka turned toward the forest and made\r\nthe sign of the cross. But Anulka searched in vain in her skirt and apron\r\nfor something with which to cover her eyes, but finding nothing she\r\ncovered them with her fingers, from between which tears began to trickle\r\nin big drops.\r\n\r\nHowever, toward evening time, just at the spot where the sun was about to\r\nset, the Bohemian appeared, and that, not by himself, but accompanied by\r\na human figure whom he drove in front of him on a rope. All rushed out\r\ntoward him with shouts of joy. But at the sight of the figure they became\r\nsilent; it was dwarfed, monkey-like, hairy, black and dressed in wolf\r\nskin.\r\n\r\n\"In the name of the Father and Son tell me; what is this figure you have\r\nbrought,\" shouted Macko.\r\n\r\n\"How do I know?\" replied the Bohemian. \"He said that he was a man and a\r\npitch-burner, but I don't know whether he told me the truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he is not a man, no,\" said Wit.\r\n\r\nBut Macko ordered him to be quiet; then he looked carefully around him\r\nand suddenly said:\r\n\r\n\"Cross yourself. We are accustomed to cross ourselves when with the\r\nspirits....\"\r\n\r\n\"Praised be Jesus Christ!\" exclaimed the prisoner, and crossed himself as\r\nfast as he could. He breathed deeply, looked with great confidence at the\r\ngroup and said:\r\n\r\n\"Praised be Jesus Christ. I too, O Jesus, was uncertain whether I was in\r\nChristian or in the devil's power.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fear not, you are among Christians, who attend the holy Mass. What are\r\nyou then?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am a pitch-burner, sir, dwelling in a tent. There are seven of us who\r\ndwell in tents with our families.\"\r\n\r\n\"How far are you from here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not quite ten furlongs.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you get to town?\"\r\n\r\n\"We have our private road along the 'Devil's Hollow.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Along what? The Devil's?... then cross yourself again.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the name of the Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost. Amen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well. Is that road practicable for vehicles?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now there is quagmire everywhere, although there is less near the Hollow\r\nthan upon the regular road; owing to the access of the wind the mud is\r\nquickly dried up. But farther on to Buda the road is bad. But those who\r\nknow the track push through it slowly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you lead us for a florin or two?\"\r\n\r\nThe pitch-burner accepted the offer willingly, but begged for half a loaf\r\nof bread, which he said is very scarce in the woods and he had seen none\r\nfor some time past. It was arranged that they should start very early the\r\nnext morning, because it was \"not good to travel in the evening,\" he\r\nsaid. \"There at Boruca ghosts storm terribly, but they do no harm. But\r\nbeing jealous for the Lenczyca principality they chase away other devils\r\ninto the bushes. It is only bad to meet them during the night, especially\r\nwhen a man is drunk, but the sober need not be afraid.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were afraid nevertheless,\" said Macko.\r\n\r\n\"Because that knight unexpectedly grasped me with such strength that I\r\ntook him for another being.\"\r\n\r\nThen Jagienka smiled that all of them took the pitch-burner to be the\r\ndevil, and he thought them to be the same. Anulka and Sieciechowa laughed\r\nat Macko's words, when he said:\r\n\r\n\"Your eyes are not yet dry from weeping for Hlawa; now you are laughing?\"\r\n\r\nThe Bohemian looked at the girl, he observed her eyelids which were still\r\nmoist, then he asked:\r\n\r\n\"Did you cry for me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course not,\" replied the girl. \"I was only scared.\"\r\n\r\n\"You ought to be ashamed. Are you not a noblewoman, and a noblewoman like\r\nyour mistress is not afraid. Nothing evil could happen to you in the\r\nmiddle of the day, and among people.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing to me, but to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yet you said that you did not cry for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I insist, not for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why did you cry?\"\r\n\r\n\"From fear.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are not afraid now?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because you have returned.\"\r\n\r\nThen the Bohemian looked at her with gratitude, smiled, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Bah! If we kept on talking in that manner we might have continued till\r\nmorning. What a smart woman you are!\"\r\n\r\n\"Make no fun of me,\" quietly replied Sieciechowa. In fact she was as\r\nsmart as any woman; and Hlawa who was himself a cunning fellow understood\r\nit well. He knew that the girl's attachment to him was daily increasing.\r\nHe loved Jagienka, but the love was that of a subject for his king's\r\ndaughter, and with great humility and reverence, and without any other\r\nmotive. Meanwhile the journey brought him in closer contact with\r\nSieciechowa. When on the march old Macko and Jagienka usually rode side\r\nby side in front, while Hlawa and Sieciechowa were together in the rear.\r\nHe was as strong as a urus and hot-blooded, so that when looking straight\r\ninto her lovely bright eyes, at her flaxen locks which escaped from under\r\nher bonnet, upon her whole slender and well-shaped figure, especially at\r\nher admirably shaped limbs gripping the black pony, his whole frame\r\ntrembled. He could restrain himself no longer. The more he looked upon\r\nthose charms the more intense and longing his gaze became. He\r\ninvoluntarily thought that if the devil were to assume the form of that\r\ngirl he would have no difficulty in leading one into temptation. She was\r\nmoreover of a sweet temperament, very obedient, and lively, like a\r\nsparrow upon the roof. Sometimes strange thoughts crossed the Bohemian's\r\nmind; once when he and Anulka remained somewhat in the rear near the\r\npackhorses, he suddenly turned toward her and said:\r\n\r\n\"Do you know I shall devour you here as a wolf devours a lamb.\"\r\n\r\nShe heartily laughed, and showed her pretty little white teeth.\r\n\r\n\"Do you want to eat me?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes I even with the little bones.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he cast such a look at her that she melted under his glances. Then\r\nthey lapsed into silence, only their hearts were beating intensely, his\r\nwith desire, and hers with pleasurable intoxication tinged with fear.\r\n\r\nBut the Bohemian's passion at first entirely prevailed over his\r\ntenderness, and when he said that he looked at Anulka like a wolf at a\r\nlamb, he told the truth. Only on that evening when he observed her\r\neyelids and cheeks moistened with tears, his heart became softened She\r\nseemed to him as good, as though near to him and as though she were\r\nalready his own, and as he himself was upright by nature, and at the same\r\ntime a knight, he not only was elated with pride, and not hardened at the\r\nsight of the sweet tears, but he courageously continued gazing at her.\r\nHis wonted gaiety of conversation left him, and although he continued to\r\njest in the evening with the timid girl, yet it was of a different\r\nnature. He treated her as a knightly armor-bearer ought to treat a\r\nnoblewoman.\r\n\r\nOld Macko was chiefly occupied in thinking of the journey, and the\r\ncrossing of the swamps, and he only praised him for his noble manners\r\nwhich, as he observed, he must have learned when he was with Zbyszko at\r\nthe Mazovian court.\r\n\r\nThen he turned to Jagienka and added:\r\n\r\n\"Hey! Zbyszko!... His deportment befits even a king's presence.\"\r\n\r\nBut his work was over in the evening, when it was time to retire. Hlawa,\r\nafter having kissed the hand of Jagienka, lifted in turn the hand of\r\nSieciechowa to his lips and said:\r\n\r\n\"Not only need you not fear me, but whilst you are with me you need fear\r\nnothing, for I shall not give you to anybody.\"\r\n\r\nThen the men went into the front room whilst Jagienka and Anulka retired\r\nto the alcove and slept together in a wide and comfortable bed. Neither\r\nfell asleep readily, especially Sieciechowa, who was restless and turned\r\nfrom side to side. At length Jagienka moved her head toward Anulka and\r\nwhispered:\r\n\r\n\"Anulka?\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me that you are much taken with that Bohemian.... Is it so?\"\r\n\r\nHer question remained unanswered.\r\n\r\nBut Jagienka whispered again:\r\n\r\n\"I understand it all.... Tell me.\"\r\n\r\nSieciechowa did not reply, but instead, pressed her lips to the cheeks of\r\nher mistress and showered kisses upon them.\r\n\r\nAt Anulka's kisses, poor Jagienka's breast heaved.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I understand, I understand,\" she whispered, so low that Anulka's ear\r\nscarcely caught her words.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nAfter a mild and foggy night, a windy and gloomy day came. At times the\r\nsky was bright, at others it was covered with broken clouds which were\r\ndriven before the wind like flocks of sheep. Macko ordered the train to\r\nmove by daybreak. The pitch-burner, who was hired as guide to Buda,\r\naffirmed that the horses could pass everywhere, but as to the wagons,\r\nprovisions and baggage, it would be necessary in some places to take them\r\napart and carry them piecemeal, and that could not be done without\r\ntedious work. But people accustomed to hard labor preferred hardship to\r\nlounging in the deserted inn. Therefore they moved on willingly. Even the\r\ntimid Wit was not scared by the words and presence of the pitch-burner.\r\n\r\nThey left the inn and entered at once between high-trunked forest trees,\r\nfree from undergrowth. They led their horses, and could pass along\r\nwithout taking the wagons to pieces. Occasionally a storm arose, and at\r\ntimes it increased to such extraordinary force that it struck the\r\nbranches of the bending pines as with gigantic wings, bending, twisting\r\nand shaking and breaking them as it were with the fans of a windmill. The\r\nforest bent under the unchained elements. Even in the intervals between\r\nthe gusts it did not cease to howl and thunder, as if angry with their\r\nrest at the inn, and the forced march they had undertaken. Now and then\r\nthe clouds entirely obscured the daylight. Drenching rain mingled with\r\nhail came down in torrents, and it became as dark as nightfall. Wit was\r\nshort of breath, and shouted that \"evil was bent to do harm and is doing\r\nit.\" But nobody paid attention to it, even the timid Anulka did not take\r\nhis words to heart because the Bohemian was so near that her stirrup\r\ntouched his, and he looked ahead with such a brave air that he seemed to\r\nwant to challenge the very devil.\r\n\r\nBehind the tall pine trees where the undergrowth began, the thickets were\r\nimpassable. There they were obliged to take the wagons in sections; they\r\ndid it dexterously and quickly. The strong servants transported the\r\nwheels, axle-tree, front of the wagon, packages and stores, upon their\r\nshoulders. The bad road continued about three furlongs. However they\r\narrived at Buda about nightfall; there the pitch-burner received them as\r\nhis guests, and they were assured by him that along the Devil's Hollow,\r\ncorrectly speaking, they could reach the town. These people, inhabitants\r\nof the pathless forest seldom saw bread or flour, yet they were not\r\nstarving. Because all kinds of smoked meat, especially eels, which\r\nabounded in all swamps and mud holes, they had in plenty. They treated\r\nthem liberally, in exchange, holding out greedy hands for the biscuits.\r\nThere were among them women and children, all blackened from the smoke.\r\nThere was also a peasant, more than one hundred years old, who remembered\r\nthe massacre of Lenczyca, which happened in 1331, and the complete\r\ndestruction of the town by the \"Knights of the Cross.\" Although Macko,\r\nthe Bohemian, and the two girls, had already heard the narrative from the\r\nprior of Sieradz, nevertheless they listened with much interest to the\r\ntale of the old man who was sitting at the fireside scraping in the\r\ncinders. It seemed as if he discovered among them the events of his\r\nearlier days. At Lenczyca, as well as at Sieradz, they spared not even\r\nthe churches and clergy, and the knives of the conquerors were covered\r\nwith the blood of old men, women and children. Always the Knights of the\r\nCross, the everlasting Knights of the Cross! The thoughts of Macko and\r\nJagienka were constantly directed toward Zbyszko, who was living in the\r\nvery jaws of the wolves, in the midst of a hardened clan who knew neither\r\npity nor the laws of hospitality. Sieciechowa was faint at heart, because\r\nshe feared that their hunt after the abbot might lead them among those\r\nterrible Knights of the Cross.\r\n\r\nBut the old man, to counteract the unfavorable impression which the\r\nstories made upon the women, told them of the battle near Plowce, which\r\nput an end to the incursions of the Knights of the Cross, and in which he\r\ntook part as a soldier in the infantry raised by the peasants, and armed\r\nwith an iron flail. In that battle perished almost the whole clan of the\r\nGradys; Macko knew all the particulars of it, nevertheless he listened\r\nnow as though it were a recital of a new terrible calamity caused by the\r\nGermans, when like cornfields before the storm they were mowed down by\r\nthe sword in the hands of the Polish knighthood and the forces of King\r\nLokietek....\r\n\r\n\"Ha! I just recollect,\" said the old man, \"when they invaded this\r\ncountry, they burned the town and castles. Yes, they even massacred the\r\ninfants in the cradles, but their terrible end came. Hey! It was a fine\r\nfight. I can see the battle now with my eyes closed....\"\r\n\r\nHe closed his eyes and was silent, gently moving the ashes until\r\nJagienka, who could wait no longer, asked:\r\n\r\n\"How was it?\"\r\n\r\n\"How was it?...\" repeated the old man. \"I remember the battlefield, it\r\nseems that I am now looking at it; there were bushes, and patches of\r\nstubble to the right. But after the battle nothing was visible but\r\nswords, axes, pikes and fine armor, one upon another, as though the whole\r\nblessed land was covered with them.... I have never seen so many slain in\r\none heap, and so much human blood shed....\"\r\n\r\nMacko's heart was strengthened anew by the recollection of these events,\r\nthen he said:\r\n\r\n\"True. Merciful Lord Jesus! They had then encompassed the kingdom like a\r\nconflagration or like a plague. Not only Sieradz and Lenczyca, but they\r\ndestroyed many other towns. What now? Are not our people mighty and\r\nindestructible? And although those dog-brothers, the Knights of the\r\nCross, were severely chastised, yet if you cannot crush them they will\r\nattack you and break your teeth.... Only see, King Kazimierz rebuilt\r\nSieradz and Lenczyca so that they are better now than ever before, yet\r\nthe incursions occur there as of old, and the Knights of the Cross are\r\nlaid low and rot there as they were at the battle of Plowce. May God\r\nalways grant them such an end!\"\r\n\r\nWhen the old peasant heard these words he nodded assent; finally he said:\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps they don't lie and rot. We of the infantry were ordered by the\r\nking, after the battle was over, to dig ditches; the peasants from the\r\nneighborhood came to assist us in our labor. We worked industriously, so\r\nthat the spades groaned. Then we laid the Germans in trenches and covered\r\nthem well, to avoid pestilence. But they did not remain there.\"\r\n\r\n\"What happened? Why did they not remain there?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not see it, but the people said afterward that after the battle\r\nthere came a fierce storm which lasted about twelve weeks, but only at\r\nnight-time. The sun shone during the daytime, but at night the wind was\r\nso fierce that it almost tore the hair from off the head. The devils,\r\nlike thick clouds, came down in great numbers, whirling like a hurricane;\r\nevery one of them held a pitchfork, and as soon as one of them reached\r\nthe earth he thrust the pitchfork into the ground and carried off one\r\nKnight of the Cross to hell. At Plowce they heard a hurly-burly of human\r\nvoices which sounded like the howling of whole packs of dogs, but they\r\ndid not know what it all meant, whether it were the noise of the Germans,\r\nwho were howling with terror and pain, or the devils with joy. That\r\ncontinued as long as the trenches were not consecrated by the priest, and\r\nthe ground was not frozen, so that there was no need even for\r\npitchforks.\"\r\n\r\nSilence followed for a moment, then the old man added:\r\n\r\n\"But God grant, Sir Knight, such an end to them as you said, and although\r\nI shall not live to see it, but such young lasses as these two will live,\r\nbut they shall not see what mine eyes have seen.\"\r\n\r\nThen he turned his head, now looking at Jagienka, now at Sieciechowa,\r\nwondering at their marvelous faces and shaking his head.\r\n\r\n\"Like poppies in corn,\" he said. \"Such beautiful faces I have never\r\nseen.\"\r\n\r\nThus they chattered during a part of the night. Then they went to sleep\r\nin the shanties and lay down upon mosses as soft as down and covered\r\nthemselves with warm fur; then after a refreshing sleep, they arose early\r\nin the morning and continued their journey. The road along the hollow was\r\nnot an easy passage, but it was not a very bad road. So that before\r\nsunset they descried the castle of Lenczyca. The city had arisen from its\r\nashes, it was rebuilt; part of it was built of brick and part of stone,\r\nits walls were high, the towers armed. The churches were even larger than\r\nthose of Sieradz. There they had no difficulty in getting information\r\nfrom the Dominican friars concerning the abbot. He was there, he said\r\nthat he felt better, and he hoped to recover his health entirely; and\r\nonly a few days ago he left for his onward journey. Macko was not bent on\r\novertaking him on the road, so he had already procured conveyance for\r\nboth girls to Plock, where the abbot himself would have taken them. But\r\nMacko was much concerned about Zbyszko, and other news distressed him.\r\nThe rivers had arisen after the departure of the abbot, and it was\r\nimpossible to continue the journey. Seeing that the knight was\r\naccompanied by a considerable retinue and was proceeding to the court of\r\nPrince Ziemowit, the Dominicans offered him their hospitality; they had\r\neven provided him with an olive-wood tablet upon which there was\r\ninscribed a Latin prayer to the angel Raphael, the patron of travelers.\r\n\r\nTheir compulsory sojourn at Lenczyca lasted a fortnight, during which\r\ntime a servant of the castle discovered that the two young pages\r\naccompanying the knight were females in disguise, and at once fell deeply\r\nin love with Jagienka. The Bohemian was about to challenge him at once,\r\nbut as it happened on the eve of their departure Macko dissuaded him from\r\ntaking such a step.\r\n\r\nWhen they moved on toward Plock, the wind had already somewhat dried the\r\nroad, and although it rained often, yet the rainfall, as is usual in the\r\nspring, consisted of larger drops, but warm, and of short duration. The\r\nfurrows upon the fields glistened with water. The moist, sweet smell from\r\nthe cultivated fields was wafted by the strong wind. The marshes were\r\ncovered with buttercups and the violets blossomed in the woods, and the\r\ngrasshoppers joyfully chirped among the branches. The hearts of the\r\ntravelers were also filled with new hope and longing, especially as they\r\nwere now progressing well. After sixteen days' travel they were at the\r\ngates of Plock.\r\n\r\nBut they arrived at night, when the gates of the city were closed. They\r\nwere obliged to pass the night with a weaver outside the wall.\r\n\r\nThe girls retired late, and after the fatigue of the long journey they\r\nfell sound asleep, but Macko, who was not troubled by fatigue, got up\r\nearly; he did not wish to wake them and he entered the town by himself at\r\nthe opening of the gates. He found the cathedral and the bishop's\r\nresidence without difficulty. There he was informed that the abbot had\r\ndied a week ago, but according to the prevailing custom they had\r\ncelebrated mass before the coffin from the sixth day, and the funeral was\r\nto take place on the day of Macko's arrival, after which would be\r\nobsequies and last honors in memory of the defunct.\r\n\r\nOwing to intense grief, Macko did not even look about the town, but he\r\nknew something already from that time when he had passed through that\r\ncity with a letter from the princess Alexandra to the grand master. He\r\nreturned to the weaver's place as fast as he could, and on his way home\r\nhe said to himself:\r\n\r\n\"Ha! He is dead. Eternal repose to him. There is nothing in the world to\r\nremedy it. But now what shall I do with the girls?\"\r\n\r\nThen he reflected whether it were not better to leave them with the\r\nprincess Alexandra, or with the princess Anna Danuta, or to take them to\r\nSpychow. It struck him more than once, that if Danuska were dead, it\r\nwould be advisable to have Jagienka close to Zbyszko at Spychow, since\r\nZbyszko, who loved Danuska above all other things would greatly mourn\r\nafter his beloved. He was also sure that Jagienka's presence at Zbyszko's\r\nside would have the desired effect. He also remembered that Zbyszko in\r\nhis boyhood, although his heart was after the woods in Mazowsze, was\r\nconstantly longing for Jagienka. For these reasons, and fully believing\r\nthat Danusia was lost, he often thought that in case of the abbot's\r\ndemise, he would not send Jagienka to any other place; but as he was\r\ngreedy to acquire landed property, he was therefore concerned about the\r\nproperty of the abbot. Surely, the abbot was displeased with them and\r\npromised to bequeath nothing to them; but after that he must have felt\r\nsorry and, before he died left something for Jagienka. He was sure that\r\nthe abbot had bequeathed something to her, because he frequently spoke\r\nabout it at Zgorzelice, and he would not overlook Zbyszko on account of\r\nJagienka. Macko was also thinking of remaining for sometime at Plock, so\r\nas to investigate the will and attend to the matter, but other thoughts\r\ncrossed his mind, and he said: \"Should I longer be here looking after\r\nproperty, whilst my boy yonder is stretching out his hand and waiting for\r\nmy help from some Knight of the Cross dungeon?\"\r\n\r\nIn truth, there was only one course, and that was: to leave Jagienka\r\nunder the care of the princess and the bishop, and beg them to look after\r\nher interest. But that plan did not please Macko. The girl has already\r\nconsiderable property of her own, and when her estate is increased by\r\nthat which the abbot has bequeathed her, then as sure as there is a God\r\nsome Mazur will take her, for she cannot hold out any longer. Zych, her\r\ndefunct father, used to say of her, that she was in danger[112] even\r\nthen. In such case, the old knight thought that both Danusia and Jagienka\r\nmight fail Zbyszko. That of course was not to be thought of.\r\n\r\nHe will take one of the two, whichever God had decreed. Finally that plan\r\nto rescue Zbyszko he preferred to the others; and as to Jagienka, he\r\nresolved either to leave her in the care of Princess Danuta, or at\r\nSpychow, but not at the court at Plock where there was much glitter, and\r\nwhich was filled with handsome knights.\r\n\r\nOverwhelmed with these thoughts, he proceeded quickly to the dwelling of\r\nthe weaver, to inform Jagienka of the abbot's death. He was determined\r\nnot to break the news to her suddenly, as it might greatly endanger her\r\nhealth. When he reached home both ladies were properly dressed and\r\nappeared as gay as birds; he sat down and ordered the servants to bring\r\nhim a jug of brown beer; then he assumed a doleful air, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Do you hear the bells ringing in town? Guess, why are they ringing,\r\nsince to-day is not Sunday, and you slept during matins. Would you like\r\nto see the abbot?\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely! What a question?\" answered Jagienka.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you shall see him as the king sees Cwiék.\"[113]\r\n\r\n\"Has he left the city?\"\r\n\r\n\"He has left, but do you not hear the bells ringing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is he dead?\" exclaimed Jagienka.\r\n\r\n\"Yes! say 'God rest his soul.' ...\"\r\n\r\nBoth ladies knelt down and began to chant: \"God rest his soul,\" in a\r\nbell-like voice. Then tears streamed down Jagienka's cheeks, for she was\r\nvery fond of the abbot, who, though of a violent temper, never harmed\r\nanybody, but did much good; he specially loved Jagienka, for he was her\r\ngodfather, he loved her as one loves his own daughter. Macko remembered\r\nthat the abbot was related to him and Zbyszko; he was also moved to tears\r\nand even cried. After his grief had subsided a little, he took the ladies\r\nand the Bohemian with him and went to the funeral services in the church.\r\n\r\nIt was a magnificent funeral. The bishop himself, Jacob of Kurdwanow,\r\nconducted it. There were present all the priests and monks of the diocese\r\nof Plock, all the bells were ringing, and prayers were said which none\r\nelse but the clergy understood, for they were said in the Latin. Then the\r\nclergy and the laity went to the banquet at the bishop's palace.\r\n\r\nMacko and his two girls (disguised as boys) also went to the banquet; he,\r\nas a relative of the deceased, and known to the bishop, was fully\r\nentitled to be present. The bishop also willingly received him as such,\r\nbut immediately after the invitation he said to Macko:\r\n\r\n\"There is here a bequest of some forests for the Gradys of Bogdaniec. The\r\nrest he did not bequeath to the abbey and the cloister, but to his\r\ngoddaughter, a certain Jagienka of Zgorzelice.\"\r\n\r\nMacko, who did not expect much, was glad for the woodlands. The bishop\r\ndid not observe that one of the youths accompanying the old knight at the\r\nmentioning of the name of Jagienka of Zgorzelice lifted up her tearful\r\neyes, and said:\r\n\r\n\"May God recompense him, but I wish he were alive.\"\r\n\r\nMacko turned and said angrily:\r\n\r\n\"Be silent, otherwise you will shame yourself.\"\r\n\r\nBut he suddenly stopped, his eyes glistened with amazement, then his face\r\nassumed wolfish fierceness, when at a distance from him opposite the\r\ndoor, through which the princess Alexandra had just entered, he observed\r\nthe figure, dressed in court uniform, of Kuno of Lichtenstein, the very\r\nman by whom Zbyszko had nearly lost his life in Krakow.\r\n\r\nJagienka had never seen Macko in such a condition. His face was\r\ncontracted like the jaws of a fierce dog, his teeth glistened beneath his\r\nmoustache, and in a moment he tightened his belt and moved toward the\r\nhateful Knight of the Cross.\r\n\r\nBut when about midway he checked himself and began to pass his broad\r\nhands through his hair; he reflected in time, that Lichtenstein might\r\nonly be a guest in the court of Plock, or an envoy, therefore, if he were\r\nto strike him without apparent reason, the very thing which happened to\r\nZbyszko on his way from Tyniec to Krakow might be repeated here.\r\n\r\nThus possessing more reason than Zbyszko, he restrained himself, adjusted\r\nthe belt to its previous place, relaxed the muscles of his face and\r\nwaited, and when the princess, after greeting Lichtenstein, entered into\r\na conversation with the bishop, Macko approached her and bowed deeply. He\r\nreminded her who he was, and that he had been once engaged in the service\r\nof his benefactress as the carrier of letters.\r\n\r\nThe princess did not recognize him at first, but she remembered the\r\nletters and the whole affair. She also was acquainted with the\r\noccurrences in the neighboring Mazovian court. She had heard of Jurand,\r\nof the imprisonment of his daughter, of Zbyszko's marriage, and of his\r\ndeadly fight with Rotgier. These things interested her greatly, so much\r\nso that it seemed to her one of those knight-errant stories or one of the\r\nminstrel songs in Germany, and the _rybalt_ songs in Mazowsze. Indeed,\r\nthe Knights of the Cross were not inimical to her, as they were to\r\nprincess Anna Danuta, the wife of Prince Janusz, more especially because\r\nthey wished to get her on their side, they strove to outvie each other in\r\nrendering her homage and adulation, and overwhelmed her with munificent\r\ngifts, but in the present case her heart beat for her favorite, whom she\r\nwas ready to help; above all, she was glad that she had before her a man\r\nwho could give her an accurate account of the events.\r\n\r\nBut Macko, who had already resolved to obtain, by whatever means\r\npossible, the protection and the princely influence, seeing that she was\r\nlistening attentively, told her Zbyszko's and Danusia's ill luck. The\r\nnarrative brought tears to her eyes, specially when she felt more than\r\nanybody the misfortune of her niece, and from her very soul she pitied\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\"I have never heard a more woeful story,\" said the princess, at last,\r\n\"the greatest sorrow to my mind is, that he has married her, that she was\r\nalready his, yet he knew no happiness. However, are you sure that he knew\r\nher not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hey! Almighty God!\" exclaimed Macko. \"If he only knew her, he was\r\nbed-ridden when he married her in the evening, and the following morning\r\nshe was carried off.\"\r\n\r\n\"And, do you think that the Knights of the Cross did it? It was said\r\nhere, that those who actually did it were robbers, and the Knights of the\r\nCross recaptured her, but it turned out to be another girl. They also\r\nspoke of a letter which Jurand had written....\"\r\n\r\n\"Human justice did not decide it, but divine. That was a great thing,\r\nthat knight Rotgier, who conquered the strongest, fell by the hand of a\r\ncomparative child.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, a fine child he is,\" said the princess, with a smile, \"his valor\r\nis a safeguard in his travels. It is a grievance, true, and your\r\ncomplaints are just, but three out of those four opponents are dead, and\r\nthe remaining old one has also, according to the information I have\r\nreceived, been nearly killed.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Danuska? And Jurand?\" replied Macko. \"Where are they? God only knows\r\nwhether something ill has happened to Zbyszko, who was on the road to\r\nMalborg.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know, but the Knights of the Cross are not such out-and-out\r\ndog-brothers as you think them to be. In Malborg nothing evil can happen\r\nto your nephew, whilst he is at the side of the grand master and his\r\nbrother Ulrych, who is an honorable knight. Your nephew undoubtedly is\r\nprovided with letters from Prince Janusz. Unless whilst there he\r\nchallenged one of the knights and succumbed. At Malborg there are always\r\npresent a great number of the most valorous knights from all parts of the\r\nworld.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay! My nephew does not fear them much,\" said the old knight. \"If they\r\nonly did not cast him in prison, or kill him treacherously, as long as he\r\nhas an iron weapon in his hand he is not afraid of them. Only once he\r\nfound himself facing one stronger than himself, but he stretched him in\r\nthe lists, and that was the Mazovian Prince Henryk who was bishop here\r\nand who was enamored of the handsome Ryngalla. But Zbyszko was then a\r\nmere youth. For this reason he would be the only one, as sure as amen in\r\nprayer, to challenge this one whom I also have vowed to challenge and who\r\nis present here.\"\r\n\r\nSaying this, he glanced in the direction of Lichtenstein, who was\r\nconversing with the governor (Waywode) of Plock.\r\n\r\nBut the princess wrinkled her brow and said in stern and dry tones, as\r\nshe always did when in an angry mood:\r\n\r\n\"Whether you vowed or not, you must remember that he is our guest and\r\nwhosoever wishes to be our guest must observe decorum.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know, most gracious lady,\" replied Macko. \"For that reason when I\r\nadjusted my belt and went to meet him, I restrained myself and thought of\r\nobedience.\"\r\n\r\n\"He will obey. He is important among his own people, even the master\r\nbuilds upon his counsel and nothing is denied to him. May God grant that\r\nyour nephew does not meet him at Malborg, especially as Lichtenstein is a\r\ndetermined and revengeful person.\"\r\n\r\n\"He could not well recognize me because he did not see me often. We had\r\nhelmets on when we were at Tyniec, after that I went only once to see him\r\nin the Zbyszko affair and that was in the evening. I observed just now\r\nthat he looked at me, but seeing that I was engaged in a lengthy\r\nconversation with Your Grace, he turned his eyes in an opposite\r\ndirection. He would have recognized Zbyszko, but he only looked at me and\r\nvery likely he did not hear of my vow, and has to think of more important\r\nchallenges.\"\r\n\r\n\"How so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because it may be that other powerful knights challenged him, such as\r\nZawisza of Garbow, Powala of Taczew, Marcin of Wrocimowice, Paszko\r\nZlodziej, and Lis of Targowisko. Every one of those, gracious lady, and\r\nten like them. So much the more so if they are numerous. It would be\r\nbetter for him not to have been born, than to have one of those swords\r\nover his head. I shall not only try to forget the challenge, but I have\r\nresolved to endeavor to go with him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\nMacko's face assumed a cunning expression like that of a fox.\r\n\r\n\"That he might give me a safe conduct to travel through the country\r\nbelonging to the Knights of the Cross, that will enable me to render\r\nassistance to Zbyszko in case of need.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does such proceeding deserve praise?\" inquired the princess with a\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\"Yes! It does,\" replied Macko. \"If for instance in time of war I were to\r\nattack him from the rear without warning him to face me I should disgrace\r\nmyself; but in time of peace if one hangs the enemy upon a hook no knight\r\nneed be reproached for such an act.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I will introduce you,\" replied the princess. She beckoned to\r\nLichtenstein and introduced Macko; she was of opinion that even if\r\nLichtenstein should recognize Macko nothing serious would result.\r\n\r\nBut Lichtenstein did not recognize him, because when he had seen him at\r\nTyniec he had his helmet on, and after that he had spoken to Macko only\r\nonce, and that in the evening, when Macko had begged him to forgive\r\nZbyszko.\r\n\r\nHowever he bowed proudly, the more so because when he saw the two\r\nexquisitely dressed youths, he thought that they were not Macko's, his\r\nface brightened up a little and he assumed a haughty demeanor as he\r\nalways did when he spoke to inferiors.\r\n\r\nThen the princess pointing at Macko, said: \"This knight is going to\r\nMalborg. I have given him a recommendation to the grand master, but he\r\nheard of your great influence in the Order; he would also like to have a\r\nnote from you.\"\r\n\r\nThen she went to the bishop, but Lichtenstein fixed his cold, steely eyes\r\nupon Macko, and asked:\r\n\r\n\"What motive induces you, sir, to visit our religious and sober capital?\"\r\n\r\n\"An upright and pious motive,\" replied Macko, looking at Lichtenstein.\r\n\"If it were otherwise the gracious princess would not have vouched for\r\nme. But apart from pious vows, I wish also to know your grand master, who\r\ncauses peace in the land and who is the most celebrated knight in the\r\nworld.\"\r\n\r\n\"Those whom your gracious and beneficent princess recommends will not\r\ncomplain of our poor hospitality. Nevertheless, as far as your wishes to\r\nknow the master is concerned, it is not an easy matter. About a mouth\r\nago, he left for Danzig, thence he was to go to Königsberg, and from that\r\nplace proceed to the frontier, where, although a lover of peace, he is\r\nobliged to defend the property of the Order against the violence of the\r\ntreacherous Witold.\"\r\n\r\nHearing this, Macko was apparently so much grieved, that Lichtenstein,\r\nwho noticed it, said:\r\n\r\n\"I see that you were quite as anxious to see the grand master as to\r\nfulfil your religious vows.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes! I am, I am,\" replied Macko. \"Is war against Witold a sure thing?\"\r\n\r\n\"He, himself, began it; he has sworn to help the rebels.\"\r\n\r\nThere was silence for a moment.\r\n\r\n\"Ha! May God help the Order as it deserves!\" said Macko. \"I see I cannot\r\nmake the grand master's acquaintance; let me at least fulfil my vow.\"\r\n\r\nBut in spite of these words, he did not know what to do, and with deep\r\ngrief he asked himself:\r\n\r\n\"Where shall I look for Zbyszko, and where shall I find him?\"\r\n\r\nIt was easy to foresee that if the grand master had left Malborg and gone\r\nto war, it was useless to look for Zbyszko there. In any case it was\r\nnecessary to get the most accurate information of his whereabouts. Old\r\nMacko was very anxious about it, but he was a man of ready resource, and\r\nhe resolved to lose no time, but continue his march next morning. Having\r\nobtained a letter from Lichtenstein with the aid of Princess Alexandra in\r\nwhom the _comthur_ had boundless confidence, it was not a difficult task\r\nto obtain. He therefore received a recommendation to the _starosta_ of\r\nBrodnic, and to the Grand Szpitalnik of Malborg, for which he presented a\r\nsilver goblet to Lichtenstein, a treasure procured in Breslau, like that\r\nwhich the knights were accustomed to have near their beds filled with\r\nwine, so that in case of sleeplessness they might have at hand a remedy\r\nfor sleep and at the same time pleasure. This act of Macko's liberality\r\nsomewhat astonished the Bohemian, who knew that the old knight was not\r\ntoo eager to lavish presents on anybody, especially on Germans, but Macko\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"I did it because I have vowed, and must fight him, and by no means could\r\nI do it to one who has done me some service. To recompense good with evil\r\nis not our custom.\"\r\n\r\n\"But such a magnificent goblet! It is a pity,\" replied the Bohemian,\r\napparently vexed.\r\n\r\n\"Don't fear. I do nothing without premeditation,\" said Macko; \"for if the\r\nLord enables me to overthrow (kill) that German, I shall get back not\r\nonly the goblet, but a great many good things I shall acquire with it.\"\r\n\r\nThen they, including Jagienka, began to take counsel among themselves\r\nconcerning further action. Macko thought of leaving Jagienka and\r\nSieciechowa with Princess Alexandra at Plock, owing to the abbot's will,\r\nwhich was in the possession of the bishop. But Jagienka was entirely\r\nopposed to it; she was even determined to travel by herself; there was no\r\nnecessity to have a separate room for night quarters, neither to observe\r\npoliteness, nor safety, and various other causes. \"Surely I did not leave\r\nZgorzelice to rusticate at Plock. The will is at the bishop's and cannot\r\nbe lost, and as far as they are concerned, when it will be shown that\r\nthere is need to remain on the road, it will be of greater advantage to\r\nbe left in the care of Princess Anna, than with Princess Alexandra,\r\nbecause at the former court the Knights of the Cross are not frequent\r\nvisitors, and Zbyszko is more appreciated there.\" Upon that Macko truly\r\nobserved that reason does not belong to women, and that it is unbecoming\r\nfor a girl \"to command\" as though she possessed reason. Nevertheless he\r\ndid not persist in his opposition, and relented entirely when Jagienka\r\nhad taken him aside and, with tears in her eyes, said:\r\n\r\n\"You know!... God sees my heart, that every morning and evening I pray\r\nfor that young lady, Danuska, and for Zbyszko's welfare. God in heaven\r\nknows it best. But you and Hlawa said that she had perished already, that\r\nshe would never escape the hands of the Knights of the Cross alive.\r\nTherefore if this has to be so, then I....\"\r\n\r\nHere she somewhat hesitated and tears streamed down her cheeks and she\r\nbecame silent.\r\n\r\n\"Then I want to be near Zbyszko....\"\r\n\r\nMacko was moved by the tears and words, yet he replied:\r\n\r\n\"If Danusia is lost, Zbyszko will be so much grieved, that he will care\r\nfor none else.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't wish that he should care for me, but I would like to be near\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know well that I should like to be myself near him as well as you\r\ndo, but he would in the first instance be unmindful of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let him be unmindful. But he will not be,\" she replied, with a smile,\r\n\"for he will not know that it was myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"He will recognize you.\"\r\n\r\n\"He will not know me. You did not recognize me. You will tell him too\r\nthat it was not I but Jasko, and Jasko is exactly like myself. You will\r\ntell him that I have grown up and it will never occur to him that it is\r\nanybody else but Jasko....\"\r\n\r\nThen the old knight remembered somebody upon his knees before him and\r\nthat kneeling one had the appearance of a boy; then there was no harm in\r\nit, specially that Jasko really had exactly the same face, and his hair\r\nafter the last cutting had again grown up and he carried it in a net just\r\nas other noble young knights. For this reason Macko gave way, and the\r\nconversation turned to matters concerning the journey. They were to start\r\non the following day. Macko decided to enter into the country of the\r\nKnights of the Cross, to draw near to Brodnic to get information there,\r\nand if the grand master was still, in spite of Lichtenstein's opinion, at\r\nMalborg, to proceed there, and if not there, to push on along the\r\nfrontiers of the country of the Knights of the Cross in the direction of\r\nSpychow, inquiring along the road about the Polish knight and his suit.\r\nThe old knight even expected that he would easily get more information of\r\nZbyszko at Spychow, or at the court of Prince Janusz of Warsaw, than\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, they moved on the following day. Spring was fully ushered\r\nin, so that the floods of the Skrwy and Drwency obstructed the way, so\r\nmuch so that it took them ten days to travel from Plock to Brodnic. The\r\nlittle town was orderly and clean. But one could see at a glance the\r\nGerman barbarity by the enormously constructed gallows,[114] which was\r\nerected out of town on the road to Gorczenice, and which was occupied by\r\nthe hanging corpses of the executed, one of which was the body of a\r\nwoman. Upon the watch-tower and upon the castle floated the flag with the\r\nred hand on a white field. The travelers did not find the count at home,\r\nbecause he was at the head of the garrison which was drafted of the\r\nneighboring noblemen, at Malborg. That information Macko got from a blind\r\nold Knight of the Cross, who was formerly the count of Brodnic, but later\r\non he attached himself to the place and castle, and he was the last of\r\nhis line. When the chaplain of the place read Lichtenstein's letter to\r\nthe count, he invited Macko as his guest; he was very familiar with the\r\nPolish language, because he lived in the midst of a Polish population,\r\nand they easily carried on their conversation in that language. In the\r\ncourse of their conversation Macko was informed that the count had left\r\nfor Malborg six weeks before, being summoned as an experienced knight to\r\na council of war. Moreover he knew what happened in the capital. When he\r\nwas asked about the young Polish knight, he had heard of such a one, he\r\nsaid, who at first had roused admiration because, in spite of his\r\nyouthful appearance, he already appeared as a belted knight. Then he was\r\nsuccessful at a tourney which, according to custom, the grand master\r\nordained, for foreign guests, before his departure for the war. Little by\r\nlittle he even remembered that the manly and noble, yet violent brother\r\nof the master, Ulrych von Jungingen, had become very fond of the young\r\nknight and had taken him under his care, provided him with \"iron\r\nletters,\" after which the young knight apparently departed toward the\r\neast. Macko was overjoyed at the news, because he had not the slightest\r\ndoubt that the young knight was Zbyszko. It was therefore useless to go\r\nto Malborg, for although the grand master, as well as other officials of\r\nthe Order, and knights who remained at Malborg might furnish more\r\naccurate information, they could by no means tell where Zbyszko actually\r\nwas. On the other hand Macko himself knew better where Zbyszko might be\r\nfound, and it was not difficult to suppose that he was at that moment\r\nsomewhere in the neighborhood of Szczytno; or in case he had not found\r\nDanusia there, he was making research in distant eastern castles and\r\ncounty seats.\r\n\r\nWithout losing any more time, they also moved toward the east and\r\nSzczytno. They progressed well on the road, the towns and villages were\r\nconnected by highways which the Knights of the Cross, or rather the\r\nmerchants of the towns, kept in good condition, and which were as good as\r\nthe Polish roads, which were under the care of the thrifty and energetic\r\nKing Kazimierz. The weather was excellent, the nights were serene, the\r\ndays bright, and about noon a dry and warm zephyr-like wind blew which\r\nfilled the human breast with health-giving air. The cornfields assumed a\r\ngreen hue, the meadows were covered with abundant flowers, and the pine\r\nforests began to emit a smell of rosin. Throughout the whole journey to\r\nLidzbark, thence to Dzialdowa, and further on to Niedzborz, they did not\r\nsee a single cloud. But at Niedzborz they encountered a thunderstorm at\r\nnight, which was the first one of the spring, but it lasted only a short\r\ntime, and in the morning it cleared up and the horizon was brightened\r\nwith rosy golden hues. It was so brilliant that the land, as far as the\r\neye could reach, appeared like one carpet brocaded with jewels. It seemed\r\nas though the whole country smiled back to the sky and rejoiced because\r\nof abundant life.\r\n\r\nIn such a pleasant morning they wended their course from Niedzborz to\r\nSzczytno. It was not far from the Mazovian frontier. It was an easy\r\nmatter to return to Spychow. There was a moment when Macko wanted to do\r\nit, but considering the whole matter he desired to push onward toward the\r\nterrible nest of the Knights of the Cross, in which Zbyszko's loss was\r\nterribly guarded. He then engaged a guide and ordered him to lead them\r\ndirectly to Szczytno; although there was no need of a guide, because the\r\nroad from Niedzborz was a straight one, marked with white milestones.\r\n\r\nThe guide was a few steps in advance. Behind him were Macko and Jagienka\r\non horseback; some distance behind them were the Bohemian and\r\nSieciechowa, and farther back were the wagons surrounded by armed men. It\r\nwas an exquisite morning. The rosy glow had not yet disappeared from the\r\nhorizon, although the sun had already risen and changed into opals the\r\ndewdrops upon the trees and grasses.\r\n\r\n\"Are you not afraid to go to Szczytno?\" asked Macko.\r\n\r\n\"I am not afraid,\" replied Jagienka, \"God is with me, because I am an\r\norphan.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no faith there. The worst dog was Danveld whom Jurand killed\r\ntogether with Godfried.... The Bohemian told me so. The second after\r\nDanveld, was Rotgier, who succumbed by Zbyszko's axe, but the old man is\r\na ruthless tyrant, and is sold to the devil.... They know not kindness.\r\nHowever, I am of opinion that if Danuska has perished she did so by his\r\nown hands. They also say that something happened to her. But the princess\r\nsaid in Plock that she extricated herself. It is with him that we shall\r\nhave to contend at Szczytno.... It is well that we have a letter from\r\nLichtenstein, and as it appears they, the dog-brothers, are afraid of him\r\nmore than they are of the master himself.... They say that he has great\r\nauthority and is particularly strict, and is very revengeful, he never\r\nforgives even the slightest offence.... Without this safe conduct I would\r\nnot travel so peacefully to Szczytno....\"\r\n\r\n\"What is his name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Zygfried von Löve.\"\r\n\r\n\"God grant that we may manage him too.\"\r\n\r\n\"God grant it!\"\r\n\r\nMacko smiled for a moment and then said:\r\n\r\n\"The princess also told me in Plock: 'Ye grieve and complain like lambs\r\nagainst wolves, but in this instance three of the wolves are dead,\r\nbecause the innocent lambs strangled them.' She spoke the truth; it is\r\nactually so.\"\r\n\r\n\"What about Danuska and her father?\"\r\n\r\n\"I told the princess the very same thing. But I am really glad, since it\r\nis demonstrated that it is not safe to harm us. We know already how to\r\nhandle the helve of an axe, and fight with it. As to Danuska and Jurand,\r\nit is true, I think, and so does the Bohemian, that they are no more in\r\nthis world, but in reality nobody can tell. I am very sorry for Jurand,\r\nfor he grieved very much for his daughter, and if he perished, it was a\r\nhard death.\"\r\n\r\n\"If such a thing is mentioned to me,\" said Jagienka, \"I always think of\r\npapa, who also is no more.\"\r\n\r\nThen she lifted up her eyes and Macko nodded his head and said:\r\n\r\n\"He rests with God in everlasting bliss, for there is not a better man\r\nthan he was in our whole kingdom....\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh there was none like him, none!\" sighed Jagienka.\r\n\r\nFurther conversation was interrupted by the guide, who suddenly checked\r\nhis stallion, turned and galloped toward Macko and shouted in a strange\r\nand frightened voice:\r\n\r\n\"O, for God's sake! Look there, Sir Knight; who is there on the hillside\r\nadvancing toward us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who? Where?\" asked Macko.\r\n\r\n\"Look there! A giant or something of that kind....\"\r\n\r\nMacko and Jagienka reined in their horses, looked in the direction\r\nindicated by the guide, and they indeed descried, about the middle of the\r\nhill, a figure, which appeared to be of more than human proportions.\r\n\r\n\"To tell the truth the man seems to be huge,\" murmured Macko.\r\n\r\nThen he frowned, and suddenly spat and said:\r\n\r\n\"Let the evil charm be upon the dog.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why are you conjuring?\" asked Jagienka.\r\n\r\n\"Because I remember that it was on just such a fine morning when Zbyszko\r\nand I were on the road from Tyniec to Krakow we saw such a giant. They\r\nsaid then that it was Walgierz Wdaly. Bah! It was shown afterward that it\r\nwas the lord of Taczew. Still, nothing good resulted from it. Let the\r\nevil charm be upon the dog.\"\r\n\r\n\"This one is not a knight, because he is not on horseback,\" said\r\nJagienka, straining her eyes. \"I even see that he is not armed, but holds\r\na staff in his left hand....\"\r\n\r\n\"And he is groping in front of him, as though it were night.\"\r\n\r\n\"And can hardly move; surely he must be blind?\"\r\n\r\n\"As sure as I live, he is blind--blind!\"\r\n\r\nThey urged their horses forward, and in a little while they halted in\r\nfront of the beggar who was slowly coming down the hill and feeling his\r\nway with his staff. He was indeed an immense old man, and appeared to\r\nthem, even when they were near him, a giant. They were convinced that he\r\nwas stone blind. Instead of eyes he had two red hollows. His right hand\r\nwas wanting; instead of it he carried a bandage of dirty rags. His hair\r\nwas white and falling down upon his shoulders, and his beard reached his\r\nbelt.\r\n\r\n\"He has neither food, nor companion, not even a dog, but is feeling the\r\nway by himself,\" exclaimed Jagienka. \"For God's sake, we cannot leave him\r\nhere without assistance. I do not know whether he will understand me, but\r\nI shall try to talk to him in Polish.\"\r\n\r\nThen she jumped from her horse and approached the beggar, and began to\r\nlook for some money in her leather pouch which was suspended from her\r\nbelt.\r\n\r\nThe beggar, when he heard the noise and tramping of the horses, stretched\r\nhis staff in front of him and lifted up his head as blind men do.\r\n\r\n\"Praised be Jesus Christ,\" said the girl. \"Do you understand, little\r\ngrandfather, in the Christian fashion?\"\r\n\r\nBut on hearing her sweet, young voice, he trembled; a strange flush\r\nappeared on his face as though from tender emotion; he covered his hollow\r\norbits with his eyebrows, and suddenly threw down his staff and fell on\r\nhis knees, with outstretched arms, in front of her.\r\n\r\n\"Get up! I will assist you. What ails you?\" asked Jagienka in\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\nBut he did not reply, but tears rolled down his cheeks, and he groaned:\r\n\r\n\"A!--a!--a!...\"\r\n\r\n\"For the love of God--Can you not say something?\"\r\n\r\n\"A!--a!\"\r\n\r\nThen he lifted up his hand, with which he made first the sign of the\r\ncross, then passed his left hand over his mouth.\r\n\r\nJagienka understood it not, and she looked at Macko, who said:\r\n\r\n\"He seems to indicate that his tongue has been torn out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did they tear out your tongue?\" asked the girl.\r\n\r\n\"A! a! a! a!\" repeated the beggar several times, nodding his head.\r\n\r\nThen he pointed with his fingers to his eyes; then he moved his left hand\r\nacross his maimed right, showing that it was cut off.\r\n\r\nThen both understood him.\r\n\r\n\"Who did it?\" inquired Jagienka.\r\n\r\nThe beggar again made signs of the cross repeatedly in the air.\r\n\r\n\"The Knights of the Cross,\" shouted Macko.\r\n\r\nAs a sign of affirmation the old man let his head drop upon his chest\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThere was silence for a moment. Macko and Jagienka looked at each other\r\nwith alarm, because they had now before them sufficient proof of their\r\ncruelty and the lack of means to chastise those knights who style\r\nthemselves \"the Knights of the Cross.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cruel justice!\" said Macko, finally. \"They punished him grievously, and\r\nGod knows whether deservedly. If I only knew where he belongs, I would\r\nlead him there, for surely he must be from this neighborhood. He\r\nunderstands our language, for the common people here are the same as in\r\nMazowsze.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you understand what we said?\" asked Jagienka.\r\n\r\nThe beggar nodded his head.\r\n\r\n\"Are you of this neighborhood?\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" The beggar shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps he comes from Mazowsze?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes!\" he nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Under Prince Janusz?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes!\"\r\n\r\n\"But what were you doing among the Knights of the Cross?\"\r\n\r\nThe old man could give no answer, but his face assumed an air of intense\r\nsuffering, so much so that Jagienka's heart beat with greater force out\r\nof sympathy. Even Macko who was not subject to emotion, said:\r\n\r\n\"I am sure the dog-brothers have wronged him. May be he is innocent.\"\r\n\r\nJagienka meanwhile put some small change in the beggar's hand.\r\n\r\n\"Listen,\" she said, \"we will not abandon you. Come with us to Mazowsze,\r\nand in every village we will ask you whether it is yours. May be we shall\r\nguess it. Meanwhile, get up, for we are no saints.\"\r\n\r\nBut he did not get up, nay, he even bowed lower and embraced her feet as\r\nmuch as to place himself under her protection and show his gratitude. Yet\r\nthere were marks of certain astonishment, yea even disappointment on his\r\nface. May be that from the voice he thought he was in the presence of a\r\nyoung woman; but his hand happened to touch the cowskin gaiters which the\r\nknights and armor-bearers were accustomed to wear.\r\n\r\nBut she said:\r\n\r\n\"It shall be so; our wagons will soon be here, then you will rest and\r\nrefresh yourself. But we are not going to take you now to Mazowsze\r\nbecause we must first go to Szczytno.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the old man heard this, he jumped straight up, terror and amazement\r\nwere depicted on his face. He opened his arms as though desiring to\r\nobstruct their way, and strange, wild ejaculations proceeded from his\r\nthroat, full of terror and dismay.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter with you?\" exclaimed Jagienka, much frightened.\r\n\r\nBut the Bohemian, who had already arrived with Sieciechowa, and for some\r\ntime had his eyes riveted upon the old beggar, suddenly turned to Macko,\r\nand with a countenance changed, and in a strange voice, said:\r\n\r\n\"For God's sake, permit me, sir, to speak to him, for you do not know who\r\nhe may be.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this he begged for no further permission, but rushed toward the old\r\nman, placed his hands upon his shoulders, and asked him:\r\n\r\n\"Do you come from Szczytno?\"\r\n\r\nThe old man appeared to be struck by the sound of his voice, quieted\r\nhimself and nodded affirmatively.\r\n\r\n\"Did you not look there for your child? ...\"\r\n\r\nA deep groan was the only reply to this question.\r\n\r\nThen the Bohemian's face paled a little, he looked sharply for a moment\r\nat the outlines of the old man's face, then he said slowly and\r\ncomposedly:\r\n\r\n\"Then you are Jurand of Spychow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jurand!\" shouted Macko.\r\n\r\nBut Jurand was overcome at that moment and fainted. Protracted torture,\r\nwant of nourishment, fatigue of the road, swept him from his feet. The\r\ntenth day had now passed since he left, groping his way, erring and\r\nfeeling his way with his stick, hungry, fatigued and not knowing where he\r\nwas going, unable to ask the way, during the daytime he turned toward the\r\nwarm rays of the sun, the night he passed in the ditches along the road.\r\nWhen he happened to pass through a village, or hamlet, or accidentally\r\nencountered people on the road, he only could beg with his hand and\r\nvoice, but seldom a compassionate hand helped him, because as a rule he\r\nwas taken for a criminal whom law and justice had chastised. For two days\r\nhe had lived on bark and leaves of trees; he was already giving up all\r\nhope of reaching Mazowsze, when suddenly compassionate voices and hearts\r\nof his own countrymen surrounded him; one of whom reminded him of the\r\nsweet voice of his own daughter; and, when at last his own name was\r\nmentioned, he was greatly agitated and unable to bear it any longer; his\r\nheart broke. His thoughts whirled through his head; and, were it not for\r\nthe strong arms of the Bohemian which supported him, he would have fallen\r\nwith his face in the dust of the road.\r\n\r\nMacko dismounted, then both took hold of him, and carried him to the\r\nwagons and laid him upon the soft hay. There, Jagienka and Sieciechowa\r\nnursed him. Jagienka observed that he could not carry the cup of wine to\r\nhis lips by himself so she helped him. Immediately after this he fell\r\ninto a profound sleep, from which he did not awake till the third day.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile they sat down to deliberate.\r\n\r\n\"To be brief,\" said Jagienka, \"we must go now to Spychow instead of\r\nSzczytno, so that by all means we place him in security among his own\r\npeople.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look, how can that be carried out,\" replied Macko. \"It is true that we\r\nmust send him to Spychow, but there is no necessity for all of us to\r\naccompany him, one wagon is enough to carry him there.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not order it, I only think so, because there we might get much\r\ninformation from him about Zbyszko, and Danusia.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how can you procure information from one who has no tongue?\"\r\n\r\n\"But the very information that he has no tongue, we got from himself. Do\r\nyou not see that even without speech we got all that information\r\nnecessary. How much more shall we derive when we communicate with him by\r\nmotions of the head and hands? Ask him, for instance, whether Zbyszko has\r\nreturned from Malborg to Szczytno. You will then see that he will either\r\nnod assent, or deny it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is true,\" said the Bohemian.\r\n\r\n\"I too do not dispute it,\" said Macko. \"I know it myself, but I am\r\naccustomed to think first and then talk.\"\r\n\r\nThen he ordered the train to return to the Mazovian frontier. On the way\r\nJagienka visited now and then the wagon where Jurand slept, fearing that\r\ndeath might ensue.\r\n\r\n\"I did not recognize him,\" said Macko, \"but it is no wonder. He was as\r\nstrong as an auroch! They said of him that he was among those who could\r\nfight with Zawisza, and now he is reduced to a skeleton.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are accustomed to hear all sorts of things,\" said the Bohemian, \"but\r\nnobody would believe it if they were told that Christians had acted thus\r\nwith a belted knight, whose patron is also Saint Jerzy.\"\r\n\r\n\"God grant that Zbyszko may at least avenge part of his wrongs. Now, look\r\nwhat a difference there is between them and us. It is true, that three\r\nout of those four dog-brothers are dead, but they died in fight, and none\r\nof them had his tongue or his eyes plucked out in captivity.\"\r\n\r\n\"God will punish them,\" said Jagienka.\r\n\r\nBut Macko turned to the Bohemian and said:\r\n\r\n\"How did you recognize him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not recognize him at first, although I saw him later than you did.\r\nBut it struck me, and the more I looked at him the more so.... Though\r\nwhen I first saw him he had neither beard nor white hair; he was then a\r\nvery powerful lord. How then could I recognize him in the old beggar. But\r\nwhen the young lady said that we were going to Szczytno, and he began to\r\nhowl my eyes were opened at once.\"\r\n\r\nMacko was absorbed in thought, then he said:\r\n\r\n\"From Spychow, it is necessary to take him to the prince, who will not\r\nleave the wrong perpetrated on such an important person, unpunished.\"\r\n\r\n\"They will excuse themselves. They treacherously abducted his child and\r\nthey defended themselves. And as to the lord of Spychow they will say\r\nthat he lost his tongue, eyes and hand in the fight.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right,\" said Macko. \"They once carried off the prince himself.\r\nHe cannot fight them, because he is no match for them; perhaps our king\r\nwill assist him. The people talk and talk of a great war, but here we\r\ndon't even have a little one.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is with Prince Witold.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank God, that at least he thinks that they are worthless. Hey! Prince\r\nWitold is my prince! In craftiness he is unsurpassable. He is more crafty\r\nthan all of them together. Those dog-brothers had him cornered once, the\r\nsword was over his head and he was about to perish, but, like a serpent,\r\nhe slipped from their hands and bit them.... Be on your guard when he\r\nstrikes, but be exceedingly careful when he is patting you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is he so with everybody?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is only so with the Knights of the Cross, but he is a kind and\r\nliberal prince with everybody else.\"\r\n\r\nAt this Macko pondered, as though making an effort to recall Prince\r\nWitold.\r\n\r\n\"He is an entirely different man to the prince here,\" he said, suddenly.\r\n\"Zbyszko ought to have joined him, for under him and through him, one\r\nmight achieve the most against the Knights of the Cross.\"\r\n\r\nThen he added:\r\n\r\n\"Both of us might be found there. Who can tell? For it is there where we\r\ncan revenge ourselves most properly.\"\r\n\r\nThen he spoke of Jurand, of his misfortunes and of the unheard of\r\ninjuries, inflicted upon him by the Knights of the Cross, who first,\r\nwithout any cause, murdered his beloved wife, then, revenge for revenge,\r\nthey carried off his child, and then mangled him in such a cruel manner,\r\nthat even the Tartars could not invent worse torture. Macko and the\r\nBohemian gnashed their teeth at the thought that even when they set him\r\nfree it was with malicious intent of inflicting additional cruelty in\r\norder to frustrate the old knight's intention, who most likely promised\r\nhimself that when he was free he would take proper steps to make an\r\ninquest and get information of the whole affair, and then pay them out\r\nwith interest.\r\n\r\nOn the journey to Spychow they passed their time in such dialogues and\r\nthoughts. The clear fine day was succeeded by a quiet starry night; they\r\ntherefore did not halt for night quarters, but stopped thrice to feed the\r\nhorses. It was yet dark when they passed the frontier, and in the\r\nmorning, led by the hired guide, they arrived upon the land of Spychow.\r\n\r\nThere Tolima apparently held everything with an iron hand, for no sooner\r\ndid they enter the forest of Spychow, than two armed men advanced against\r\nthem. These, seeing that the newcomers were not soldiers, but a simple\r\ntrain, not only let them pass without questioning, but placed themselves\r\nin front to show the way, which was inaccessible to those unacquainted\r\nwith the moats and marshes.\r\n\r\nTolima and the priest Kaleb received the guests when they arrived in\r\ntown. The news that the lord had arrived, and was brought back by pious\r\npeople spread like lightning through the garrison. But when they saw him\r\nin the condition as he looked when he left the Knights of the Cross,\r\nthere was such an outburst of raging and wild threatening that if there\r\nhad yet been any Knights of the Cross confined in the prison of Spychow,\r\nno human power would have been able to save them from a terrible death.\r\n\r\nThe retainers wished to mount their horses at once and start to the\r\nfrontier to capture any Germans and cut off their heads and throw them\r\nunder the feet of the master. But Macko restrained them because he knew\r\nthat the Germans lived in the towns and cities, whilst the country people\r\nwere of the same blood, but lived against their own will under foreign\r\nsuperior force. But neither the din and noise nor the creaking of the\r\nwell-sweeps could awake Jurand, who was carried upon a bearskin into his\r\nown house and put to bed. Father Kaleb was Jurand's intimate friend; they\r\ngrew up together and loved each other like brothers; he remained with\r\nhim, and prayed that the Redeemer of the world might restore to the\r\nunfortunate Jurand, his eyes, tongue, and hand.\r\n\r\nThe fatigued travelers went to bed also. Macko who awoke about noon,\r\nordered Tolima to be called.\r\n\r\nHe knew from the Bohemian that Jurand, before his departure, had ordered\r\nall his servants to obey their young master, Zbyszko, and that the priest\r\nhad informed him of his ownership of Spychow. Macko therefore spoke to\r\nthe old man with the voice of a superior:\r\n\r\n\"I am the uncle of your young master, and as long as he is away, I am the\r\ncommander here.\"\r\n\r\nTolima bowed his grey head, which had something wolfish, and surrounding\r\nhis ear with his hand, asked:\r\n\r\n\"Then you are, sir, the noble knight from Bogdaniec?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes!\" replied Macko. \"How do you know it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because the young master Zbyszko expected and inquired after you here.\"\r\n\r\nHearing this, Macko stood up straight, and forgetting his dignified\r\nmanner, he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"What, Zbyszko in Spychow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he was here, sir; only two days ago since he left.\"\r\n\r\n\"For the love of God! Whence did he come and where did he go?\"\r\n\r\n\"He came from Malborg, and on the road he was at Szczytno. He did not say\r\nwhere he was going.\"\r\n\r\n\"He did not say, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"May be he told the priest Kaleb.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hey! Mighty God, then we crossed each other on the road,\" he said,\r\nputting his hands on his ribs.\r\n\r\nBut Tolima put his hand to the other ear:\r\n\r\n\"What did you say, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is Father Kaleb?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is at the bedside of the old master.\"\r\n\r\n\"Call him, but stop ... I will go myself to see him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will call him,\" said Tolima, and he left. But before he brought the\r\npriest, Jagienka entered.\r\n\r\n\"Come here,\" said Macko. \"Do you know the news? Zbyszko was here only two\r\ndays ago.\"\r\n\r\nHer face changed in a moment and she almost tottered.\r\n\r\n\"He was, and left?\" she asked, with quickly beating heart. \"Where to?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is only two days since he left, but where to I do not know. May be\r\nthe priest knows.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must go after him,\" she said, peremptorily.\r\n\r\nAfter a while Father Kaleb entered. Thinking that Macko wanted him for\r\ninformation concerning Jurand, he anticipated his question by saying:\r\n\r\n\"He is still asleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"I heard that Zbyszko was here?\" said Macko.\r\n\r\n\"He was, but he left two days ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where to?\"\r\n\r\n\"He did not know himself.... Searching.... He left for the frontier of\r\nZmudz, where there is war now.\"\r\n\r\n\"For the love of God, tell us, father, what you know about him!\"\r\n\r\n\"I only know what I heard from himself. He was at Malborg. May be he\r\nobtained protection there. Because with the order of the master's\r\nbrother, who is the first among the knights, Zbyszko could search in all\r\ncastles.\"\r\n\r\n\"For Jurand and Danuska?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but he does not search for Jurand, because he was told that he was\r\ndead.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell us from the beginning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Immediately, but let me first catch breath and regain presence of mind,\r\nfor I come from another world.\"\r\n\r\n\"How so?\"\r\n\r\n\"From that world which cannot be reached on horseback, but through\r\nprayer.... I prayed at the feet of the Lord Jesus that He may have mercy\r\nupon Jurand.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have asked for a miracle. Have you that power?\" asked Macko, with\r\ngreat curiosity.\r\n\r\n\"I have no power whatever, but I have a Saviour, who, if He wished, could\r\nrestore to Jurand his eyes, tongue and hand....\"\r\n\r\n\"If He only wanted to do so He could,\" replied Macko. \"Nevertheless you\r\nasked for an impossible thing.\"\r\n\r\nFather Kaleb did not reply; possibly because he did not hear it; his eyes\r\nwere still closed, as if absent-minded, and in reality it was obvious\r\nthat he was meditating on his prayer.\r\n\r\nThen he covered his eyes with his hands and remained so for a while in\r\nsilence. Finally he shook himself, rubbed his eyes with his hands, and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Now, ask.\"\r\n\r\n\"In what manner did Zbyszko attack the Justice of Sambinsk?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is no more the Justice of Sambinsk....\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind that.... You understand what I am asking; tell me what you\r\nknow about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"He fought at a tourney. Ulrych liked to fight in the arena. There were\r\nmany knights, guests at Malborg, and the master ordered public games.\r\nWhilst Ulrych was on horseback the strap of the saddle broke and it would\r\nhave been an easy matter for Zbyszko to throw him from his horse; but he\r\nlowered his spear to the ground and even assisted him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hey! You see!\" exclaimed Macko, turning toward Jagienka. \"Is this why\r\nUlrych likes him?\"\r\n\r\n\"This is the reason of his love for Zbyszko. He refused to tilt against\r\nhim with sharp weapons, neither with the lance, and has taken a liking to\r\nhim. Zbyszko related his trouble to him, and he, being zealous of his\r\nknightly honor, fell into a great passion and led Zbyszko to his brother,\r\nthe master, to lodge a complaint. May God grant him redemption for this\r\ndeed, for there are not many among them who love justice. Zbyszko also\r\ntold me that de Lorche, owing to his position and wealth, was of much\r\nhelp to him, and testified for him in everything.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was the result of that testimony?\"\r\n\r\n\"It resulted in the vigorous order of the grand master to the _comthur_\r\nof Szczytno, to send at once to Malborg all the prisoners who were\r\nconfined in Szczytno, including even Jurand. Concerning Jurand, the\r\n_comthur_ replied that he had died from his wounds and was buried there\r\nin the church-yard. He sent the other prisoners, including a milkmaid,\r\nbut our Danusia was not among them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know from the armor-bearer Hlawa,\" said Macko, \"that Rotgier, whom\r\nZbyszko killed whilst at the court of Prince Janusz, also spoke in the\r\nsame manner about a certain milkmaid whom they captured whom they took\r\nfor Jurand's daughter, but when the princess asked: 'How could they\r\nmistake Danusia for a common girl, since they knew and had seen the true\r\none, Danusia?'\" \"You are right,\" he replied, \"but I thought they had\r\nforgotten the real Danusia.\" \"This same thing the _comthur_ had written\r\nto the master that that girl was not a prisoner but she was under their\r\ncare, that they had at first rescued her from the robbers, who had sworn\r\nthat she was Jurand's daughter, but transformed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did the master believe it?\"\r\n\r\n\"He did not know whether to believe or not, but Ulrych was more incensed\r\nthan ever, and influenced his brother to send an official of the Order\r\nwith Zbyszko to Szczytno, which was done. When they arrived at Szczytno,\r\nthey did not find the old _comthur_, because he had departed to the\r\neastern strongholds against Witold, to the war; but a subordinate, whom\r\nthe magistrate ordered to open all prisons and underground dungeons. They\r\nsearched and searched, but found nothing. They even detained people for\r\ninformation. One of them told Zbyszko that he could get much information\r\nfrom the chaplain, because the chaplain understood the dumb executioner.\r\nBut the old _comthur_ had taken the executioner with him, and the\r\nchaplain left for Königsberg to attend a religious gathering.... They met\r\nthere often in order to lodge complaints against the Knights of the Cross\r\nto the pope, because even the poor priests were oppressed by them....\"\r\n\r\n\"I am only surprised that they did not find Jurand,\" observed Macko.\r\n\r\n\"It is obvious that the old _comthur_ let him go. There was more\r\nwickedness in that than if they had cut his throat. They wished that he\r\nshould suffer excruciatingly more than a man of his standing could\r\nendure.--Blind, dumb and maimed.--For God's sake!... He could neither\r\nfind his home, nor the road, not even ask for a morsel of bread.... They\r\nthought that he would die somewhere behind a fence from hunger, or be\r\ndrowned in some river.... What did they leave him? Nothing, but the means\r\nof discerning the different degrees of misery. And this meant torture\r\nupon torture.... He might have been sitting somewhere near the church, or\r\nalong the road, and Zbyszko passed by without recognizing him. May be he\r\neven heard Zbyszko's voice, but he could not hail him.... Hey!... I\r\ncannot keep myself from weeping!... God wrought a miracle, and that is\r\nthe reason why I think that He will do a great deal more, although this\r\nprayer proceeds from my sinful lips.\"\r\n\r\n\"What else did Zbyszko say? Where did he go to?\" asked Macko.\r\n\r\n\"He said: 'I know that Danuska was at Szczytno, but they have carried her\r\noff, or starved her. Old von Löve did it, and so help me God, I will not\r\nrest until I get him.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he say so? Then it is sure that the _comthur_ left for the east, but\r\nnow there is war.\"\r\n\r\n\"He knew that there was a war, and that is the cause why he left for the\r\ncamp of Prince Witold. He also said, he would succeed sooner in scoring a\r\npoint against the Knights of the Cross through him, than through the\r\nking.\"\r\n\r\n\"So, to Prince Witold!\" exclaimed Macko.\r\n\r\nThen he turned to Jagienka.\r\n\r\n\"Did I not tell you the very same thing. As I live, I said: 'that we\r\nshould also have to go to Witold.' ...\"\r\n\r\n\"Zbyszko hoped,\" said Father Kaleb, \"that Prince Witold would make an\r\ninroad into Prussia and take some of the castles there.\"\r\n\r\n\"If time were given to him, he would not delay,\" replied Macko. \"Praise\r\nGod now, we know at least where to look for Zbyszko.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must press on at once,\" said Jagienka.\r\n\r\n\"Silence!\" said Macko. \"It is not becoming for a boy to interrupt the\r\ncouncil.\"\r\n\r\nThen he stared at her, as though to remind her that she was a boy; she\r\nremembered and was silent.\r\n\r\nMacko thought for awhile, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Now we shall surely find Zbyszko, for he is not moving aimlessly; he is\r\nat the side of Prince Witold. But it is necessary to know whether he is\r\nstill searching for something in this world, besides the heads of the\r\nKnights of the Cross which he vowed to get.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can that be ascertained?\" asked Father Kaleb.\r\n\r\n\"If we knew that the priest of Szczytno had already returned from the\r\nsynod. I should like to see him,\" said Macko. \"I have letters from\r\nLichtenstein to Szczytno and I can go there without fear.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was not a synod gathering, but a congress,\" replied Father Kaleb,\r\n\"and the chaplain must have returned long ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well. Everything is upon my own shoulders. I shall take Hlawa with\r\nme, and two servants, with proper horses and go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then to Zbyszko?\" asked Jagienka.\r\n\r\n\"Then to Zbyszko,\" replied Macko. \"But you must wait for me here until I\r\nreturn. I also think that I shall not be detained there for more than\r\nthree or four days. I am accustomed to mosquitoes and fatigue. Therefore,\r\nI ask you, Father Kaleb, to give me a letter to the chaplain of Szczytno.\r\nHe will believe me without hesitation if I show your letter, for there is\r\nalways great confidence among the clergy.\"\r\n\r\n\"The people speak well of that priest,\" said Father Kaleb, \"and if there\r\nis one who knows something, it is he.\"\r\n\r\nHe prepared a letter in the evening, and in the morning, before sunrise,\r\nold Macko left Spychow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nJurand awoke from his long sleep in the presence of the priest; he forgot\r\nwhat had happened to him and where he was; he began to feel around in bed\r\nand at the wall. The priest caught him in his arms and wept, tenderly\r\nkissing him, and said:\r\n\r\n\"It is I! You are at Spychow! Brother Jurand!... God tried you.... But\r\nyou are now among your own.... Good people brought you here. Brother,\r\ndear brother, Jurand.\"\r\n\r\nThen he repeatedly pressed him to his breast, kissed his brow and his\r\nhollow eyes; but Jurand appeared to be stupefied and unconscious. At last\r\nhe moved his left hand toward his head and brow as though wishing to\r\ndispel the cloud of sleep and stupor from his mind.\r\n\r\n\"Do you hear and understand me?\" asked Father Kaleb.\r\n\r\nJurand moved his head affirmatively. Then he stretched his hand toward\r\nthe silver crucifix on the wall which he had once taken from the neck of\r\na powerful German knight, pressed it to his lips and heart and then gave\r\nit to Father Kaleb.\r\n\r\n\"I understand you, brother!\" said the priest. \"He remained with you. He\r\nis able to restore to you all you lost, just as He delivered you from\r\ncaptivity.\"\r\n\r\nJurand pointed with his hand heavenward, a sign that all will there be\r\nreturned to him. Then his hollow eyes were filled with tears, and an\r\nindescribable pain was depicted upon his tortured face.\r\n\r\nFather Kaleb having observed his painful emotion concluded that Danuska\r\nwas dead. He therefore knelt at the bedside and said:\r\n\r\n\"O Lord! Grant her eternal rest in peace, and everlasting bliss be hers.\r\nAmen.\"\r\n\r\nThen Jurand lifted himself up and began to twist his head and move his\r\nhand as though wishing to check the priest, but the priest did not\r\nunderstand. At that moment old Tolima entered, and with him were the\r\ngarrison of the town, the former and present elders of the peasants of\r\nSpychow, foresters, fishermen, etc., because the news of Jurand's return\r\nhad rapidly spread throughout Spychow. They embraced his feet, kissed his\r\nhand and bitterly wept when they saw the old and maimed cripple who\r\nlooked like another being, not in the least the once invincible knight,\r\nthe terror of the Knights of the Cross. But some of them, especially\r\nthose who used to accompany him on his expeditions, were enraged; their\r\nfaces grew pale and determined. After a while they crowded together and\r\nwhispered, pulled, and pushed each other. Finally, a certain Sucharz, a\r\nmember of the garrison and village blacksmith, approached Jurand, clasped\r\nhis feet and said:\r\n\r\n\"We intended to go to Szczytno, as soon as they brought you here, but\r\nthat knight, who brought you, hindered us. Permit us, sir, now. We cannot\r\nleave them unpunished. Let it be now as it was long ago. They shall not\r\ndisgrace us and remain scathless. We used to fight them under your\r\ncommand. Now we will march under Tolima, or without him. We must conquer\r\nSzczytno and shed the dog-blood. So help us God!\"\r\n\r\n\"So help us God!\" repeated several voices.\r\n\r\n\"To Szczytno!\"\r\n\r\n\"We must have blood!\"\r\n\r\nForthwith a burning fire took hold of the inflammable Mazur hearts, their\r\nbrows began to wrinkle, their eyes to glisten. Here and there was heard\r\nthe sound of gnashing teeth. But in a moment the noise ceased, and all\r\neyes were turned toward Jurand, whose cheeks reddened and he assumed his\r\nwonted warlike appearance. He rose and again felt for the crucifix upon\r\nthe wall. The people thought that he was looking for a sword. He found it\r\nand took it down. His face paled, he turned toward the people, lifted his\r\nhollow eyes heavenward and moved the crucifix in front of him.\r\n\r\nSilence reigned. It was beginning to get dark; the twittering of birds\r\nretiring upon the roofs and trees of the village, penetrated through the\r\nopen windows. The last red rays of the setting sun penetrated into the\r\nroom and fell upon the raised cross and upon Jurand's white hair.\r\n\r\nSucharz, the blacksmith, looked at Jurand, glanced at his comrades and\r\nlooked again at Jurand. Finally, he bid them good-bye and left the room\r\non tiptoe. The others followed suit. When they reached the courtyard they\r\nhalted, and the following whispered conversation ensued:\r\n\r\n\"What now?\"\r\n\r\n\"We are not going. How then?\"\r\n\r\n\"He did not permit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Leave vengeance with God. It is obvious that even his soul has undergone\r\na change.\"\r\n\r\nIt was so indeed.\r\n\r\nThose who remained were Father Kaleb and old Tolima. Jagienka with\r\nSieciechowa, who were attracted by the armed crowd in the courtyard, came\r\nto learn what was the matter.\r\n\r\nJagienka, who was more daring and sure of herself than her companion,\r\napproached Jurand.\r\n\r\n\"God help you, Knight Jurand,\" she said. \"We are those who brought you\r\nhere from Prussia.\"\r\n\r\nHis face brightened at the sound of her young voice. It was obvious that\r\nit brought back to his mind in proper order all the events which had\r\nhappened upon the road from Szczytno, because he showed his thankfulness\r\nby inclining his head and placing his hand upon his chest several times.\r\nThen she related to him how they first met him, how Hlawa, the Bohemian,\r\nwho was Zbyszko's armor-bearer, recognized him, and finally how they\r\nbrought him to Spychow. She also told him about herself, that she and her\r\ncompanion bore a sword, helmet and shield for the knight Macko of\r\nBogdaniec, the uncle of Zbyszko, who left Bogdaniec to find his nephew,\r\nand now he had left for Szczytno and would return to Spychow within three\r\nor four days.\r\n\r\nAt the mention of Szczytno, Jurand did not fall down nor was he overcome\r\nas he was when upon the road to that place, but great trouble was\r\ndepicted upon his face. But Jagienka assured him that Macko was as clever\r\nas he was manly, and would not let himself be fooled by anybody. Besides\r\nthat, he possessed letters from Lichtenstein, which enabled him to travel\r\nin safety everywhere.\r\n\r\nThese words quieted him considerably. It was obvious that he wished to\r\nget information about many other things. But as he was unable to do it,\r\nhe suffered in his soul. This the clever girl at once observed and said;\r\n\r\n\"We shall often, talk about things. Then everything will be told.\"\r\n\r\nThen he smiled and stretched out his hand and placed it upon her head for\r\na while; it seemed he was blessing her. He thanked her indeed very much,\r\nbut as a matter of fact he was touched by the youthful voice like the\r\nwarbling of a bird.\r\n\r\nWhen he was not engaged in prayer, as he was almost all day, or asleep,\r\nhe wished to have her near him, and when she was not there, he yearned to\r\nhear her speak, and endeavored by all means in his power to call the\r\nattention of the priest and Tolima that he wished to have that delightful\r\nboy near him.\r\n\r\nShe came often, because her tender heart sincerely pitied him. Besides\r\nthat, she passed the time in waiting for Macko, whose stay at Szcytno\r\nseemed to her uncommonly long.\r\n\r\nHe was to return within three days, and now the fourth and fifth have\r\npassed by and it is already the evening of the sixth, and he has not yet\r\nreturned. The alarmed girl was ready to ask Tolima to send a searching\r\nparty, when suddenly the guard upon the watch-oak signalled the approach\r\nof some horsemen, and in a few moments was heard the tramp of the horses\r\nupon the drawbridge, and Hlawa accompanied by a courier appeared in the\r\ncourtyard. Jagienka who had left her room, to watch in the courtyard\r\nbefore their arrival, rushed toward Hlawa before he dismounted.\r\n\r\n\"Where is Macko?\" she asked, with beating heart and alarmed.\r\n\r\n\"He went to Prince Witold, and he ordered you to stay here.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nWhen Jagienka realized the import of Macko's message, that she was to\r\nremain at Spychow, she was almost stunned. Grief and anger rendered her\r\nspeechless for a while, and with wide opened eyes she stared at the\r\nBohemian, which told him how unwelcome was the information he brought\r\nher. He therefore said:\r\n\r\n\"I should also like to inform you, what we heard at Szczytno. There is\r\nmuch and important news.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it from Zbyszko?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, from Szczytno. You know....\"\r\n\r\n\"Let the servant unsaddle the horses, and you come with me.\"\r\n\r\nThe order was executed and they went into her room.\r\n\r\n\"Why does Macko leave us here? Why must we remain at Spychow, and why did\r\nyou return here?\" she asked in one breath.\r\n\r\n\"I returned,\" replied Hlawa, \"because the knight Macko ordered me. I\r\nwished to go to the war, but an order is an order. Knight Macko told me\r\nthus: 'Return, take care of the lady of Zgorzelice, and wait for news\r\nfrom me. You may have to escort her to Zgorzelice, since she cannot go\r\nthere by herself.'\"\r\n\r\n\"For the love of God, tell me what happened! Did they find Jurand's\r\ndaughter? Has Macko gone there to search for Zbyszko? Did you see her?\r\nHave you spoken to her? Why have you not brought her with you? Where is\r\nshe now?\"\r\n\r\nHearing such an avalanche of questions, the Bohemian bowed to the girl's\r\nfeet and said:\r\n\r\n\"Let it not displease your grace if I do not reply to all questions at\r\nonce, for it is impossible for me to do so, but, I shall if nothing\r\nhinders, endeavor to answer them one by one in the order according as\r\nthey were put.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, did they find her?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but there is sure information that she was at Szczytno, and that she\r\nwas probably removed to a distant castle in the east.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why must we remain at Spychow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah! If she were found?... It is true, as your grace is aware.... There\r\nwould be no reason for remaining here....\"\r\n\r\nJagienka was silent, only her cheeks reddened. But the Bohemian said;\r\n\r\n\"I thought and am still of the opinion, that we shall not be able to\r\nrescue her alive from the talons of those dog-brothers. But everything is\r\nin God's hands. I must relate to you from the beginning. We arrived at\r\nSzczytno. Well. Knight Macko showed Lichtenstein's letter to the bailiff,\r\nwho kissed the seal in our presence, and received us as guests. He did\r\nnot suspect us in the least and had full confidence in us, so that if we\r\nhad had a few of our men in the neighborhood we could easily have taken\r\npossession of the castle. There was no hindrance to our interview with\r\nthe priest. We conversed for two nights; we informed ourselves of strange\r\nthings which the priest got from the executioner.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the executioner is dumb.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is, but the priest speaks to him by signs, and he understands him\r\nperfectly well. They are strange things. It must have been the finger of\r\nGod. That executioner cut off Jurand's hand, tore out his tongue, and put\r\nout his eyes. That executioner is such that where men are concerned he\r\nwould not shrink from inflicting any torture, even if he were ordered to\r\npull the teeth of the victim; but, where girls are concerned, he would\r\nnot lift up his hand to kill them, or to assist in torturing them. The\r\nreason for this determination is, because he too had an only daughter\r\nwhom he loved dearly, and whom the Knights of the Cross have....\"\r\n\r\nHere Hlawa stopped; he knew not how to continue his narrative. This\r\nJagienka observed, and she said:\r\n\r\n\"What do I care about the executioner?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because this is in order,\" he replied. \"When our young master quartered\r\nthe knight Rotgier the old _comthur_ Zygfried almost raved. They said at\r\nSzczytno that Rotgier was the _comthur's_ son. The priest confirmed the\r\nstory, that no father ever loved his son as much as Zygfried loved\r\nRotgier; for his thirst for vengeance he sold his soul to the devil. All\r\nthis the executioner saw. The _comthur_ talked with the slain Rotgier, as\r\nI am talking to you, and the corpse smiled; then he gnashed his teeth,\r\nand for joy he licked his livid lips with his black tongue when the old\r\n_comthur_ promised him Zbyszko's head. But as he could not then get\r\nZbyszko, he ordered Jurand to be tortured in the meanwhile and then\r\nplaced Jurand's tongue and hand in Rotgier's coffin, who began to devour\r\nit....\"\r\n\r\n\"It is terrible to hear. In the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost,\r\namen,\" said Jagienka. Then she got up and threw a log of wood on the fire\r\nbecause it was night already.\r\n\r\n\"How,\" continued Hlawa, \"how will it be in the day of judgment? Because\r\nthen everything belonging to Jurand must be restored to him. But that\r\nsurpasses human understanding. The executioner then saw everything.\r\nGorged with human flesh, the old _comthur_ went to take Jurand's\r\ndaughter, because the other, it seems, whispered to him that he wanted to\r\ndrink innocent human blood, after his meal. But the executioner, as I\r\nhave already told you, who did everything, but would not hurt or kill a\r\ngirl, placed himself upon the staircase.... The priest said that\r\notherwise the executioner is stupid and half a brute, but in that matter\r\nhe was wide awake, and when necessary he has no equal in cunning. He sat\r\non the stairs and waited, until the _comthur_ arrived and heard the\r\nbreathing of the executioner. He saw something shining and started back\r\nfor he thought it was the devil. The executioner struck him in the neck\r\nwith his fist, so that he thought the bones were completely shattered. He\r\ndid not die, but fainted, and became sick with fright. When he recovered,\r\nhe was afraid to repeat this attempt upon Jurandowna.\"\r\n\r\n\"But they have carried her off.\"\r\n\r\nThey have, but they have taken the executioner with her. The _comthur_\r\ndid not know that it was he who defended Jurandowna. He thought that some\r\nsupernatural power, good or evil, did it. He had taken the executioner\r\nwith him and would not leave him at Szczytno. He was afraid of his\r\ntestimony, for although dumb, he could in case of a trial testify by\r\nsigns that which he told the priest. Moreover, the priest finally told\r\nMacko that old Zygfried no more threatens Jurandowna, because he is\r\nafraid; and although he ordered somebody else to harm her, nothing will\r\nhappen to her as long as Diedrich lives; he will not permit it,\r\nespecially as he has already protected her once.\"\r\n\r\n\"But does the priest know where they have taken her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not exactly, but he heard them talk of a certain place called Ragniec,\r\nwhich castle is situated not far from the Lithuanian or Zmudz frontiers.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did Macko say concerning that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pan Macko told me the following day: 'If it is so, then I can and will\r\nfind her, but I must hasten to Zbyszko, to see that he is not entrapped\r\nby them through Jurandowna as they did with Jurand. They have only to\r\ntell him that if he comes by himself they will give her up to him and he\r\nwould not hesitate to go; then old Zygfried would wreak his vengeance\r\nupon him, for the death of Rotgier, in unheard-of tortures.'\"\r\n\r\n\"True! It is true!\" exclaimed Jagienka, alarmed. \"If that is the reason\r\nof his hurried departure, then he is right.\"\r\n\r\nBut after a moment she turned to Hlawa and said:\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless he made a mistake in sending you here. There is no need to\r\nguard us here. Old Tolima can do it as well. You, being strong and\r\nintrepid, could be of much help to Zbyszko there.\"\r\n\r\n\"But who would guard you in case you were to go to Zgorzelice?\"\r\n\r\n\"In such a case they would have to convey the news by somebody; they will\r\ndo it through you. You will precede them and take us home.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bohemian kissed her hand, and asked, with emotion:\r\n\r\n\"But during the time of your sojourn here?\"\r\n\r\n\"God watches over orphans! I shall remain here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you not find it tedious? What will you do here?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall ask the Lord Jesus to restore happiness to Zbyszko and keep all\r\nof you in good health.\"\r\n\r\nThen she burst out weeping, and the armor-bearer bowed again at her feet,\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n\"You are indeed like an angel in heaven.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nBut she wiped away her tears, took the armor-bearer with her and went to\r\nJurand to tell him the news. She found him in a bright room, the tame\r\nshe-wolf at his feet, sitting with Father Kaleb, old Tolima and\r\nSieciechowa. Supporting their heads with their hands, absorbed in\r\nthought, and sorrowful, they were listening to a poem which the village\r\nbeadle, who was also the _rybalt_, accompanied by his lute, sang of\r\nJurand's former exploits against the \"abominable Knights of the Cross.\"\r\nThe room was lit up by the moon. A very warm and quiet night followed a\r\nscorching day. The windows were open, and beetles from the linden in the\r\ncourtyard, were seen crawling upon the floor. In front of the fireplace,\r\nwhere there were yet glimmering a few embers, sat the servant sipping a\r\nmixture of hot mead, wine and spices.\r\n\r\nThe _rybalt_, or beadle, and servant of Father Kaleb, was about to begin\r\nanother song, entitled \"The Happy Encounter.\" \"Jurand is riding, riding,\r\nupon a chestnut-colored horse,\" when Jagienka entered and said:\r\n\r\n\"The Lord Jesus be praised!\"\r\n\r\n\"Forever and ever,\" replied Father Kaleb. Jurand sat in an armchair, with\r\nhis elbows upon the arms, but when he heard her voice he immediately\r\nturned toward her, and began to greet her, nodding his milk white head.\r\n\r\n\"Zbyszko's armor-bearer has arrived from Szczytno,\" said the girl, \"and\r\nhas brought news from the priest. Macko will not return to this place. He\r\nwent to Prince Witold.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why will he not return here?\" asked Father Kaleb.\r\n\r\nThen she told all she had heard from the Bohemian. She related how\r\nZygfried avenged himself for Rotgier's death; how the old _comthur_\r\nintended to destroy Danusia for Rotgier to drink her innocent blood; and\r\nhow the executioner defended her. She even told them of Macko's hopes to\r\nfind Danusia, with Zbyszko's assistance, rescue her, bring her to\r\nSpychow; and for that very reason he had gone to Zbyszko and ordered her\r\nto remain here.\r\n\r\nBe it from grief or sorrow her voice trembled at the end. When she\r\nfinished, silence prevailed for a while in the room and only the chirping\r\nof the crickets, from the linden in the courtyard, penetrated through the\r\nopen windows and sounded like a heavy rainfall. All eyes were directed\r\ntoward Jurand, who with closed eyelids and head bent backward, showed no\r\nsign of life.\r\n\r\n\"Do you hear?\" finally asked the priest.\r\n\r\nBut Jurand kept on bending his head, lifted up his left hand and pointed\r\ntoward the sky. The light of the moon fell directly upon his face, upon\r\nthe white hair, upon the blind eyes; and there was depicted in that face\r\nsuch indescribable suffering, together with complete hope and resignation\r\nin God's will, that it appeared to all present that he only saw with his\r\nsoul which was freed from the fetters of the body, and had renounced once\r\nfor all earthly life, in which nothing was left for him.\r\n\r\nSilence again reigned and the noise of the crickets was still audible.\r\n\r\nBut almost with filial love, Jagienka was suddenly overcome with great\r\npity for the unhappy old man. At the first impulse she rushed to his\r\nside, grasped his hand and covered it with kisses and tears.\r\n\r\n\"And I too am an orphan!\" she exclaimed, with swelling heart. \"I am not a\r\nboy, but am Jagienka of Zgorzelice. Macko took me in order to protect me\r\nfrom bad people. Now I shall remain with you until God restores Danusia\r\nto you.\"\r\n\r\nJurand was not at all surprised; he seemed to know it already; he only\r\ntook hold of her and pressed her to his breast, and she continued to kiss\r\nhis hand and spoke in a broken and sobbing voice:\r\n\r\n\"I will remain with you. Danuska will return.... Then I shall return to\r\nZgorzelice. God protects the orphans! The Germans have also killed my\r\nfather. But your beloved one is alive and will return. Grant this, O most\r\nmerciful God! Grant this, O most holy and compassionate Mother!...\" Then\r\nFather Kaleb suddenly knelt and with a solemn voice began to pray:\r\n\r\n\"Lord have mercy upon us!\"\r\n\r\n\"Christ have mercy upon us!\" immediately responded the Bohemian and\r\nTolima. Then all knelt down, because it was the Litany, which is not only\r\nsaid at the moment of death, but also for the delivery of dear and near\r\npersons from the danger of death. Jagienka knelt; Jurand slipped down\r\nfrom his seat and knelt, and all began to pray in chorus:\r\n\r\n\"Lord have mercy upon us!\"\r\n\r\n\"Christ have mercy upon us!\"\r\n\r\n\"O God the Father in Heaven, have mercy upon us!\"\r\n\r\n\"Son of God, Redeemer of the world, have mercy upon us!\"\r\n\r\nTheir praying voices, \"Have mercy upon us!\" were mingled with the\r\nchirping of the crickets.\r\n\r\nThe tame she-wolf suddenly got up from the bearskin upon which she was\r\ncrouching, in front of Jurand, approached the open window, supported\r\nherself upon the sill, turned her triangular jaws toward the moon and\r\nhowled in a low and plaintive voice.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF PART SIXTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART SEVENTH\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTo a certain extent the Bohemian adored Jagienka, but his love for the\r\ncharming Sieciechowna was on the increase, nevertheless his young and\r\nbrave heart caused him to be eager above all for war. He returned to\r\nSpychow with Macko's message, in obedience to his master, and therefore\r\nhe felt a certain satisfaction that he would be protected by both\r\nmasters, but when Jagienka herself told him what was the truth, that\r\nthere was none to oppose him in Spychow and that his duty was to be with\r\nZbyszko, he gladly assented. Macko was not his immediate authority. It\r\nwas therefore an easy matter to justify himself before him, that he had\r\nleft Spychow at the command of his mistress to go to Zbyszko.\r\n\r\nBut Jagienka did it purposely, that the valiant and clever armor-bearer\r\nmight always be of assistance to Zbyszko and save him in many dangerous\r\nsituations. He had already shown his ability at the prince's hunting\r\nparty in which Zbyszko nearly perished from the attack of a urus; much\r\nmore so would he be useful in war, specially such as the present one on\r\nthe Zmudz frontier. Glowacz was so eager for the field, that when he left\r\nJurand with Jagienka he embraced her feet and said:\r\n\r\n\"I desire to kneel before you at once and beg you for a good word for my\r\njourney.\"\r\n\r\n\"How is that?\" asked Jagienka. \"Do you want to go to-day?\"\r\n\r\n\"Early to-morrow, so that the horses may rest during the night, for the\r\nexpedition to Zmudz is very far.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then go so that you may easily overtake Macko.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be a hard task. The old gentleman is hardy in all kinds of toil,\r\nand he is several days ahead of me. In order to shorten my way I shall\r\nhave to travel through Prussia, through pathless forests. Pan Macko has\r\nletters from Lichtenstein which he can show when necessary; but I have\r\nnothing to show, I shall therefore be obliged to make a free road for\r\nmyself.\"\r\n\r\nThen he placed his hand upon his sword. At that Jagienka exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Be careful! It is necessary to travel as fast as possible, but on the\r\nother hand you must be careful to avoid being caught and imprisoned by\r\nthe Knights of the Cross. Also be careful whilst you are in the wild\r\nforests, for there are just now all kinds of gods whom the people of that\r\nland who have not been converted to Christianity worship. I remember what\r\nMacko and Zbyszko said about them in Zgorzelice.\"\r\n\r\n\"I too remember what they said about those gods, but I am not afraid of\r\nthem; they are puny things and no gods, and they have no power whatever.\r\nI shall manage them as well as the Germans whom I shall meet in the field\r\nand make it hot for them.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you can't kill gods! Tell me, what did you hear of them among the\r\nGermans?\"\r\n\r\nThen the discreet Bohemian wrinkled his brow, stopped for a moment, and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Killing or no killing, we informed ourselves of everything, specially\r\nPan Macko, who is cunning and able to circumvent every German. He asks\r\nfor one thing or another, or pretends to salute, and says nothing that\r\nmight betray him, and whatever he says is to the point and draws his\r\ninformation as the angler draws out the fish. If your grace will listen\r\npatiently I will tell you: Some years ago, Prince Witold planned an\r\nexpedition against the Tartars, but wished to be at peace with the\r\nGermans; he therefore ceded to them the province of Zmudz. Then there was\r\ngreat friendship and peace. He allowed them to build castles. Bah, he\r\neven assisted them. They, including the master, met at an island, where\r\nthey ate, drank and showed each other much friendship. They were even\r\npermitted to hunt in those wild forests. When the poor people of Zmudz\r\nrose in arms against the rule of the Order, Prince Witold helped the\r\nGermans with his own soldiers. The people throughout Lithuania murmured\r\nthat the prince was against his own blood. All this the under-bailiff of\r\nSzczytno related to us; he praised the courts of the Knights of the Cross\r\nin Zmudz because they sent priests to that country to convert the people\r\nto Christianity and feed them in time of dearth. Something of that kind\r\nwas done, for the grand master, who fears God more than the others,\r\nordered it. But instead of it, they gathered together the children and\r\nsent them to Prussia, and they outraged the women in the presence of\r\ntheir husbands and brothers; whoever dared to oppose it was hanged. This,\r\nlady, is the cause of the present war.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Prince Witold?\"\r\n\r\n\"The prince had his eyes shut for a long time to the wrongs of the\r\noppressed people of Zmudz, and he loved the Knights of the Cross. It is\r\nnot long since the princess, his wife, went to Prussia to visit Malborg.\r\nThey received her with great pomp, as though she were the queen of\r\nPoland. That happened quite recently! They showered gifts upon her, and\r\ngave numerous tourneys, feasts, and all kinds of fètes wherever she went.\r\nThe people thought that it would result in everlasting friendship between\r\nthe Knights of the Cross and Prince Witold. But suddenly his heart was\r\nchanged....\"\r\n\r\n\"This confirms what I heard from my lamented father and Macko more than\r\nonce, that the prince often changed his heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not often toward the upright, but frequently toward the Knights of the\r\nCross, owing to the very reason that they themselves keep no faith, and\r\nare unreliable in everything. They asked him to give up deserters to\r\nthem. His reply was that he would give up only those of ill repute, but\r\nfree men he would not, because, as such, they were entitled to live\r\nwherever they chose. Just now they are soured and engaged in writing\r\nletters, complaining against each other. The people of Zmudz, now in\r\nGermany, heard of it; they left the garrisons, stirred up the people in\r\nthe small castles, and now they make raids in Prussia itself and Prince\r\nWitold not only does not hinder them any longer, but he also laughs at\r\nthe German trouble, and assists the Zmudzians secretly.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand,\" said Jagienka. \"But if he assists them secretly, open war\r\nis not yet declared.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is open war with the Zmudz people, but as a matter of fact there\r\nis also war against Prince Witold. Germans are coming from all parts of\r\nthe country to defend their strongholds on the frontier and are\r\ncontemplating a great expedition to invade Zmudz. But they cannot execute\r\nit before the winter season arrives, because it is a swampy country and\r\nimpossible for them to fight in, and where a Zmudz warrior could pass, a\r\nGerman knight would stick fast. Winter, therefore, would be favorable to\r\nthe Germans. As soon as it begins to freeze, the whole German forces will\r\nmove, but Prince Witold will come to the aid of the Zmudz people. He will\r\ncome with the permission of the king of Poland, since the king is the\r\nhead of all great princes and, above all, Lithuania.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then there will be war against the king?\"\r\n\r\n\"The people here, as well as in Germany, say that there will be war. The\r\nKnights of the Cross are probably now collecting forces in all courts,\r\nwith cowls upon their heads like thieves. For every Knight of the Cross\r\nknows that the king's army is no joke, and, most likely, the Polish\r\nknights would easily vanquish them.\"\r\n\r\nJagienka sighed, and said:\r\n\r\n\"A boy is always more happy than a girl is. Here is proof of what I say.\r\nYou will go to the war, as Zbyszko and Macko went, and we shall remain\r\nhere, in Spychow.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can it be otherwise, lady? It is true that you remain here, but\r\nperfectly secure. The name of Jurand I have learned in Szczytno, is still\r\na terror to the Germans, and if they learn that he is now at Spychow they\r\nwill be terrified at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"We know that they will not dare to come here, because the swamps and old\r\nTolima defend this place, but it will be hard to sit here without news.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will let you know if anything occurs. Even before we departed for\r\nSzczytno, two good young noblemen volunteered to start for the war.\r\nTolima was unable to prevent it, because they are noblemen and come from\r\nLenkawice. We shall now depart together and if anything occurs, one of\r\nthem will be sent to you with the news.\"\r\n\r\n\"May God reward you. I have always known that you are wise in any\r\nadventure, but for your willingness and good heart toward me I shall\r\nthank you as long as I live.\"\r\n\r\nThen the Bohemian knelt upon one knee and said:\r\n\r\n\"I have had nothing but kindness from you. Pan Zych captured me near\r\nBoleslawce, when I was a mere boy, and set me free without any ransom.\r\nBut I preferred captivity under you to freedom. God grant that I might\r\nshed my blood for you, my lady.\"\r\n\r\n\"God lead you and bring you back!\" replied Jagienka, holding out her hand\r\nto him.\r\n\r\nBut he preferred to bow to her knees and kiss her feet to honor her the\r\nmore. Then he lifted up his head and said submissively and humbly:\r\n\r\n\"I am a simple boy, but I am a nobleman and your faithful servant. Give\r\nme therefore some token of remembrance for my journey. Do not refuse me\r\nthis request; war time is approaching and I take Saint Jerzy to witness\r\nthat I shall always try to be one of those in front, but never in the\r\nrear.\"\r\n\r\n\"What kind of souvenir do you ask for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Girdle me with a strip of cloth for the road, so that if I fall in the\r\nfield my pain may be lessened in having, when dying, the belt you\r\nfastened round my body.\"\r\n\r\nThen he bowed again at her feet, folded his arms and gazed into her eyes\r\nimploringly.\r\n\r\nBut Jagienka's face assumed a troubled look, and after a while she\r\nreplied as if with involuntary bitterness:\r\n\r\n\"O, my dear! Ask me not for that, my girdling will be of no use to you.\r\nWhoever is happy can impart happiness to you. Only such an one can bring\r\nyou fortune. But I, surely, have nothing but sorrow! Alas! I can give\r\nhappiness neither to you nor others; for that which I do not possess\r\nmyself I cannot impart to others. I feel so, Hlawa. There is nothing,\r\nnow, for me in the world, so, so that....\"\r\n\r\nThen she suddenly ceased, because she knew that if she said another word\r\nit would cause her to burst into tears, even so her eyes became clouded.\r\nBut the Bohemian was greatly moved, because he understood that it would\r\nbe equally bad for her, in case she had to return to Zgorzelice and be in\r\nthe neighborhood of the rapacious villains Cztan and Wilk: or to remain\r\nin Spychow, where sooner or later Zbyszko might come with Danusia. Hlawa\r\nseemed to understand Jagienka's troubles, but he had no remedy for them.\r\nHe therefore embraced her knees again and repeated.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! I will die for you! I will die!\"\r\n\r\n\"Get up!\" she said. \"Let Sieciechowna gird you for the war, or let her\r\ngive you some other keepsake, because you have been friends for some time\r\npast.\"\r\n\r\nThen she began to call her, and Sieciechowna entered from the neighboring\r\nroom immediately. She had heard before she entered, but she dared not\r\nenter although she burned with desire to take leave of the handsome\r\narmor-bearer. She therefore was frightened and confused, and her heart\r\nwas beating violently when she entered; her eyes were glistening with\r\ntears, and with lowered eyelashes she stood before him; she looked like\r\nan apple blossom, and could not utter a single word.\r\n\r\nHlawa worshipped Jagienka, but with deepest respect, and he dared not\r\nreach her even in mind. He often thought familiarly about Sieciechowna\r\nbecause the blood in his veins coursed rapidly at the very sight of her\r\nand he could not withstand the presence of her charms. But now his heart\r\nwas taken by her beauty, especially when he beheld her confusion and\r\ntears, through which he saw affection as one sees the golden bed of a\r\ncrystal stream.\r\n\r\nHe therefore turned toward her and said:\r\n\r\n\"Do you know that I am going to war. Perchance I shall perish. Will you\r\nbe sorry for me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall feel very sorry for you!\" replied the girl, in soft tones. Then\r\nshe shed copious tears as she was always ready to do. The Bohemian was\r\nmoved and began to kiss her hands, smothering his desire for more\r\nfamiliar kisses in the presence of Jagienka.\r\n\r\n\"Gird him or give him something else as a memento for the road, so that\r\nhe may fight under your colors and in your name.\"\r\n\r\nBut Sieciechowna had nothing to give him, because she was attired in\r\nboy's clothes. She searched for something but found neither ribbon, nor\r\nanything that could be fastened, because her women's dresses were still\r\npacked up in the baskets, which had not been touched since they left\r\nZgorzelice. She was therefore greatly perplexed until Jagienka came to\r\nher rescue by advising her to give him the little net upon her head.\r\n\r\n\"My God!\" Hlawa joyously exclaimed, \"let it be the net, attach it to the\r\nhelmet, and woe betide that German who attempts to reach it.\"\r\n\r\nThen Sieciechowna took it down with both hands and immediately her bright\r\ngolden hair fell upon her shoulders and arms. At the sight of her\r\nbeautiful disheveled hair, Hlawa's face changed, his cheeks flamed and\r\nthen paled. He took the net, kissed it, and hid it in his breast. Then he\r\nembraced Jagienka's feet once more, and did the same, though a little\r\nmore strongly than was necessary, to Sieciechowna. Then with the words:\r\n\"Let it be so,\" he left the house without another word.\r\n\r\nAlthough he was about to travel and in want of rest, he did not go to\r\nsleep. With his two companions who were to accompany him to Zmudz, he\r\ndrank throughout the whole night. But he was not intoxicated, and at the\r\nfirst ray of light he was already in the courtyard where the horses were\r\nready for the journey.\r\n\r\nFrom the membrane window above the carriage house two blue eyes were\r\nlooking upon the courtyard. When the Bohemian observed them, he wished to\r\napproach and show the net which he had attached to his helmet, then wish\r\nher good-bye once more, but Father Kaleb and old Tolima, who came to give\r\nhim advice for his journey, interrupted him.\r\n\r\n\"Go first to the court of Prince Janusz,\" said the priest. \"Perhaps Pan\r\nMacko stopped there. At all events, you will get there proper\r\ninformation; you will find there numerous acquaintances. Also the road\r\nthere to Lithuania is known, and it is not difficult there to procure\r\nguides for the wilderness. If you are indeed bent on seeing Pan Zbyszko,\r\nthen do not go directly to Zmudz, for there is the Prussian reservation,\r\nbut go via Lithuania. Remember that the Zmudzians themselves might kill\r\nyou even before you could shout to them who you were. But it is quite a\r\ndifferent matter in Lithuania in the direction where Prince Witold is.\r\nFinally, may God bless you, and those two knights. May you return in good\r\nhealth and bring the child with you. I shall daily lie prostrate before\r\nthe cross from vespers to the rising of the first star in prayer for this\r\ncause.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thank you, father, for your blessing,\" replied Hlawa. \"It is not an\r\neasy task to rescue one alive from their devilish hands. But since\r\neverything is in God's hands, it is better to hope than to sorrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is better to hope, for this reason I do not despair. Hope lives,\r\nalthough the heart is full of anxiety.... The worst is, that Jurand\r\nhimself, when his daughter's name is mentioned, immediately points with\r\nhis finger toward heaven as though he already sees her there.\"\r\n\r\n\"How could he see her without eyes?\"\r\n\r\nThe priest then replied, partly to himself and partly to Hlawa:\r\n\r\n\"Perchance he who has lost his bodily vision sees more with his spiritual\r\neyes.... It may be so. It may be! But this, that God should permit so\r\nmuch wrong to be done to such an innocent lamb I do not understand\r\nclearly. Why should she suffer so much, even if she had offended the\r\nKnights of the Cross. But there was nothing against her and she was as\r\npure as the divine lily, loving to others and lovely as yonder little\r\nfree singing bird. God loves children, and is compassionate. Bah! If they\r\nwere to kill her, He is able to resuscitate her as He did Piotrowina, who\r\nafter having risen from the grave lived for many long years.... Depart in\r\npeace, and may God's hand protect you all!\"\r\n\r\nThen he returned to the chapel to say early Mass. The Bohemian mounted\r\nhis horse, for it was already broad daylight, and bowed once more toward\r\nthe window and departed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nPrince and Princess Janusz had left with part of the court for the spring\r\nfishing at Czerska, of which sport he was extremely fond, and loved it\r\nabove all others. The Bohemian got much important information from\r\nMikolaj of Dlugolas, treating of private affairs as well as of the war.\r\nFirst he learned that Macko had apparently given up his intended route to\r\nZmudz, the \"Prussian enclosure,\" that a few days ago he had left for\r\nWarsaw where he found the princely pair. As to the war, old Mikolaj\r\ninformed him all that he had already heard in Szczytno. All Zmudz, as one\r\nman, had risen in arms against the Germans, and Prince Witold not only\r\nhad refused to help the Order against the unhappy Zmudzians, but had not\r\nyet declared war against them, and was negotiating with them; but\r\nmeanwhile he supplied the Zmudzians with money, men, horses and corn.\r\nMeanwhile, he, as well as the Knights of the Cross, sent ambassadors to\r\nthe pope, to the emperor, and to other Christian lords, accusing each\r\nother of breach of faith, and treachery. The ambassador carrying the\r\nletters of the prince was the clever Mikolaj of Rzeniewa, a man of great\r\nability who could unravel the thread which was woven by the artifice of\r\nthe Knights of the Cross, convincingly demonstrating the great wrongs\r\ndone to the lands of Lithuania and Zmudz.\r\n\r\nMeantime when at the diet in Wilno the ties between the Poles and\r\nLithuanians were strengthened, it acted like poison in the hearts of the\r\nKnights of the Cross. It was easy to foresee that Jagiello as the supreme\r\nlord of all the lands under the command of Prince Witold, would stand at\r\nhis side in time of war. Count Jan Sayn, the _comthur_ of Grudzia, and\r\nCount Schwartzburg of Danzig, went, at the request of the grand master,\r\nto see the king and asked him what might be expected from him. Although\r\nthey brought him falcons and costly presents, he told them nothing. Then\r\nthey threatened him with war, without really intending it, because they\r\nwell knew that the grand master and the chapter were terribly afraid of\r\nJagiello's forces, and were anxious to avert the day of wrath and\r\ncalamity.\r\n\r\nAll their schemes were broken like cobwebs, especially with Prince\r\nWitold. The evening after Hlawa's arrival, fresh news reached Warsaw.\r\nBronisz of Ciasnoc, courtier of Prince Janusz, whom the prince had\r\npreviously sent for information from Lithuania, arrived, and with him\r\nwere two important Lithuanian princes. They brought letters from Witold\r\nand the Zmudzians. It was terrible news. The Order was preparing for war.\r\nThe fortresses were being strengthened, ammunition manufactured,\r\nsoldiers, (knechts) and knights were gathering at the frontier, and the\r\nlighter bodies of cavalry and infantry had already crossed the frontier\r\nnear Ragnety, Gotteswerder and other border strongholds. The din of war\r\nwas already heard in the forests, fields and villages, and during the\r\nnight the woods were seen on fire along the dark sea. Witold finally\r\nreceived Zmudz under his overt protection. He sent his governors, and\r\nwagons with armed people he placed under the most famous warrior\r\nSkirwoillo. He broke into Prussia, burned, destroyed and devastated. The\r\nprince himself approached with his army toward Zmudz. Some fortresses he\r\nprovisioned; others, Kowno, for instance, he destroyed, so that the\r\nKnights of the Cross might find no support. It was no more a secret, that\r\nat the advent of winter, when the swamps should be frozen, or even\r\nearlier than that, if the season was dry, a great war would break out,\r\nwhich would embrace all the lands of Lithuania, Zmudz, and Prussia. But\r\nshould the king rush to the assistance of Witold then a day must follow\r\nin which the flood would inundate the German or the other half of the\r\nworld, or would be forced back for long ages into its original river-bed.\r\n\r\nBut that was not to happen yet. Meanwhile, the sighs of the Zmudzians,\r\ntheir despairing complaints of the wrongs done to them, and their appeals\r\nfor justice were heard everywhere. They also read letters concerning the\r\nunfortunate people in Krakow, Prague, in the pope's court and in other\r\nwestern countries. The nobleman brought an open letter to Prince Janusz,\r\nfrom Bronisz of Ciasnoc. Many a Mazovian involuntarily laid his hand on\r\nhis sword at his side and considered seriously whether voluntarily to\r\nenroll under the standard of Witold. It was known that the great prince\r\nwould be glad to have with him the valiant Polish nobles, who were as\r\nvalorous in battle as the Lithuanian and Zmudzian nobility, and better\r\ndisciplined and equipped than they. Others were also impelled by their\r\nhatred toward the old enemies of the Polish race, whilst others wanted to\r\ngo out of compassion.\r\n\r\n\"Listen! Oh listen!\" They appealed to the kings, princes and to the whole\r\nZmudzian nation. \"We are people of noble blood and free, but the Order\r\nwants to enslave us! They do not care for our souls, but they covet our\r\nlands and wealth. Our need is already such that nothing remains for us\r\nbut to gather together, or kill ourselves! How can they wash us with\r\nChristian water when they themselves have unclean hands. We wish to be\r\nbaptized, but not with blood and the sword. We want religion, but only\r\nsuch as upright monarchs shall teach,--Jagiello and Witold.\r\n\r\n\"Listen to us and help us, for we perish! The Order does not wish to\r\nchristen us for our enlightenment. They do not send us priests, but\r\nexecutioners. Our beehives, our flocks, and all the products of our land\r\nthey have already carried away. We are not even allowed to fish or hunt\r\nin the wilds.\r\n\r\n\"We pray you: Listen to us! They are just bending our necks under the\r\nyoke and force us to work during the night in the castles. They have\r\ncarried off our children as hostages; our wives and daughters they ravish\r\nin our presence. It behooves us to groan, but not to speak. Our fathers\r\nthey have burned at the stake; our lords have been carried off to\r\nPrussia. Our great men, Korkucia, Wasigina, Swolka and Songajle, they\r\nhave destroyed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh listen! for we are not wild beasts but human beings. We earnestly\r\ncall upon the Holy Father to send us Polish bishops to baptize us, for we\r\nthirst for baptism from the very depth of our heart. But baptism is\r\nperformed with water and not with shedding of human living blood.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the kind of complaint the Zmudzians made against the Knights of\r\nthe Cross, so that when they were heard by the Mazovian court, several\r\nknights and courtiers immediately presented themselves ready to go and\r\nhelp them; they understood that it was not even necessary to ask for\r\npermission from Prince Janusz, even if only for the reason that the\r\nprincess was the sister of Prince Witold. They were specially enraged\r\nwhen they learned from Bronisz and the noblemen, that many noble Zmudzian\r\nyoung ladies, who were hostages in Prussia, but could not endure dishonor\r\nand cruelty, had taken their own lives when the Knights of the Cross were\r\nabout to attack their honor.\r\n\r\nHlawa was very glad to learn of the desire of the Mazovian knights,\r\nbecause he thought that the more men from Poland that joined Prince\r\nWitold, the more intense would be the war, and the affair against the\r\nKnights of the Cross would be more potent. He was also glad of his\r\nchances of meeting Zbyszko, and the old knight Macko, to whom he was much\r\nattached and whom, he believed, he was worthy to meet, and together see\r\nnew wild countries, hitherto unknown cities, and see knights and soldiers\r\nnever seen before, and, finally, that Prince Witold whose great fame\r\nresounded then throughout the world.\r\n\r\nThose thoughts decided him to undertake the long and hurried journey--not\r\nstopping upon the road more than was necessary for the horses to rest.\r\n\r\nThe noblemen who arrived with Bronisz of Ciasnoc and other Lithuanians\r\nwho were present at the prince's court, and who were acquainted with the\r\nroads and all passes, were to guide him and the Mazovian knights, from\r\nhamlet to hamlet, from city to city and through the silent, immense, deep\r\nwilderness which covered the greater part of Mazovia, Lithuania and\r\nZmudz.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nIn the woods, about a mile to the east of Kowno, which Witold had\r\ndestroyed, were stationed the principal forces of Skirwoillo, extending\r\nin time of need from point to point in the neighborhood. They made quick\r\nexpeditions sometimes to the Prussian frontier, and at others against the\r\ncastles and smaller fortified places which were still in the hands of the\r\nKnights of the Cross, and filled the country with flame of war. There the\r\nfaithful armor-bearer found Zbyszko and Macko only two days after the\r\nlatter arrived. After greetings, the Bohemian slept like a rock the whole\r\nnight, only on the following evening he went out to greet the old knight\r\nwho looked fatigued and ill-humored and received him angrily, and asked\r\nhim why he had not remained at Spychow as ordered. Hlawa restrained\r\nhimself till Zbyszko had left the tent, when he justified his conduct,\r\nwhich was owing to Jagienka's command.\r\n\r\nHe also said that apart from her order, and his natural inclination for\r\nwar, he was urged by the desire, in case of emergency, to carry the news\r\nto Spychow at once. \"The young lady,\" he said, \"who has a soul like an\r\nangel, is praying against her own interest for Jurandowna. But there must\r\nbe an end to everything. If Danusia is not alive, then let God give her\r\neternal glory, because she was an innocent lamb. But should she be found,\r\nthen it will be necessary to let Jagienka know it immediately, so that\r\nshe may at once leave Spychow, and not wait until the actual return of\r\nJurandowna, which would seem as though she were driven away in shame and\r\ndishonor.\"\r\n\r\nMacko listened unwillingly, repeating from time to time: \"It is not your\r\nbusiness.\" But Hlawa had resolved to speak openly; he did not entirely\r\nagree in this with Macko; at last he said:\r\n\r\n\"It would have been better if the young lady had been left at Zgorzelice.\r\nThis journey is in vain. We told the poor lady that Jurandowna was dead\r\nand that something else might turn up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nobody but you said that she was dead,\" exclaimed the knight, with\r\nanger. \"You ought to have held your tongue. I took her with me because I\r\nwas afraid of Cztan and Wilk.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was only a pretext,\" replied the armor-bearer. \"She might have\r\nsafely remained at Zgorzelice, and those fellows would have hurt each\r\nother. But, you feared, sir, that, in case of Jurandowna's death Jagienka\r\nmight escape Zbyszko. That is the reason why you took her with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"How dare you speak so? Are you a belted knight and not a servant?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am a servant, but I serve my lady; that is the reason why I am\r\nwatching that no evil betide her.\"\r\n\r\nMacko reflected gloomily, because he was not satisfied with himself. More\r\nthan once he had blamed himself for taking Jagienka with him, because he\r\nfelt that in any case, under such circumstances, it would be, to a\r\ncertain extent, to her disadvantage. He also felt that there was truth in\r\nthe Bohemian's bold words, that he had taken the girl with him in order\r\nto preserve her for Zbyszko.\r\n\r\n\"It never entered my head,\" he said, nevertheless, to deceive the\r\nBohemian. \"She was anxious to go herself.\"\r\n\r\n\"She persisted because we said that the other was no more in this world,\r\nand that her brother would be safer without than with her; it was then\r\nthat she left.\"\r\n\r\n\"You persuaded her,\" shouted Macko.\r\n\r\n\"I did, and I confess my guilt. But now, sir, it is necessary to do\r\nsomething; otherwise we shall perish.\"\r\n\r\n\"What can one do here?\" said Macko, impatiently, \"with such soldiers, in\r\nsuch a war?... It will be somewhat better, but that cannot be before\r\nJuly, because the Germans have two favorable seasons for war, viz: winter\r\nwhen everything is frozen, and the dry season. Now it is only\r\nsmouldering, but does not burn. It seems that Prince Witold went to\r\nKrakow to interview the king and ask his permission and help.\"\r\n\r\n\"But in the neighborhood are the fortresses of the Knights of the Cross.\r\nIf only two could be taken, we might find there Jurandowna, or hear of\r\nher death.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Zygfried brought her to this part of the country. They told us so at\r\nSzczytno, and everywhere, and we ourselves were of the same opinion.\"\r\n\r\n\"But did you observe these soldiers; go into the tents and look for\r\nyourself. Some of them are armed with clubs, whilst others with\r\nantiquated swords made of copper.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah! As far as I have heard they are good fighters.\"\r\n\r\n\"But they cannot conquer castles with naked bodies, especially those of\r\nthe Knights of the Cross.\"\r\n\r\nFurther conversation was interrupted by the arrival of Zbyszko and\r\nSkirwoillo, who was the leader of the Zmudzians. He was a small man and\r\nlooked like a boy, but broad shouldered and strong, his chest protuded so\r\nmuch that it looked like a deformity, his hands were long, they almost\r\nreached his knees. In general he resembled Zyndram of Maszkow, a famous\r\nknight, whom Macko and Zbyszko had formerly known in Krakow, because he\r\nalso had a tremendous head and bowed legs. They said that he too\r\nunderstood the art of war very well. He had spent a lifetime in fighting\r\nthe Tartars in Russia, and the Germans, whom he hated like the plague. In\r\nthose wars he had learned the Russian language, and later on, at the\r\ncourt of Witold, he had learned some Polish. He knew German, at least he\r\nrepeated only the three words: \"Fire, blood and death.\" His big head was\r\nalways filled with ideas and stratagems of war, which the Knights of the\r\nCross could neither foresee nor prevent. He was therefore banished from\r\nthe lands on the other side of the frontier.\r\n\r\n\"We were talking of an expedition,\" said Zbyszko to Macko, with unusual\r\nanimation, \"and that is the reason why we came here so that we too might\r\nlearn your opinion.\"\r\n\r\nMacko sat down with Skirwoilla upon a pine stump covered with a bear\r\nskin. Then he ordered the servants to bring little tubs full of mead from\r\nwhich the knights drew with tin cups and drank. Then after they had taken\r\nrefreshment, Macko asked:\r\n\r\n\"Do you want to undertake an expedition?\"\r\n\r\n\"Burn the German castles....\"\r\n\r\n\"Which?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ragnety, or Nowe (new) Kowno.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ragnety,\" said Zbyszko. \"We were three days in the neighborhood of Nowe\r\nKowno, and they beat us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just so,\" said Skirwoilla.\r\n\r\n\"How so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait,\" said Macko, \"I am a stranger here, and do not know where Nowe\r\nKowno and Ragnety are.\"\r\n\r\n\"From this place to Old Kowno is less then a mile,\"[115] replied Zbyszko,\r\n\"and from that place to Nowe Kowno, is the same distance. The castle is\r\nsituated upon an island. We wanted to cross over yesterday, but we were\r\nbeaten in the attempt; they pursued us half the day, then we hid\r\nourselves in the woods. The soldiers scattered and only this morning some\r\nof them returned.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Ragnety?\"\r\n\r\nSkirwoilla stretched his long arms, pointed toward the north, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Far! Far....\"\r\n\r\n\"Just for the reason that it is distant,\" replied Zbyszko, \"there is\r\nquiet in the neighborhood, because all the soldiers were withdrawn from\r\nthere and sent to this place. The Germans there expect no attack; we\r\nshall therefore fall upon those who think themselves secure.\"\r\n\r\n\"He speaks reasonably,\" said Skirwoilla.\r\n\r\nThen Macko asked:\r\n\r\n\"Do you think that it will also be possible to storm the castle?\"\r\n\r\nSkirwoillo shook his head and Zbyszko replied:\r\n\r\n\"The castle is strong, therefore it can only be taken by storm. But we\r\nshall devastate the country, burn the towns and villages, destroy\r\nprovisions, and above all take prisoners, among whom we may find\r\nimportant personages, for whom the Knights of the Cross will eagerly give\r\nransom or exchange....\"\r\n\r\nThen he turned toward Skirwoillo and said:\r\n\r\n\"You yourself, prince, acknowledged that I am right, but now consider\r\nthat Nowe Kowno is upon an island, there we shall neither stir up the\r\npeople in the villages, drive off the herds of cattle, nor take\r\nprisoners, the more so because they have repulsed us here. Ay! Let us\r\nrather go where they do not expect us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Conquerors are those who least expect an attack,\" murmured Skirwoillo.\r\n\r\nHere Macko interrupted and began to support Zbyszko's plans, because he\r\nunderstood that the young man had more hope to hear something near\r\nRagnety than near Old Kowno, and that there were more chances to take\r\nimportant hostages at Ragnety who might serve for exchange. He also\r\nthought that it was better to go yonder at all events and attack an\r\nunguarded land, than an island, which was a natural stronghold and in\r\naddition was guarded by a strong castle and the customary garrison.\r\n\r\nHe spoke as a man experienced in war, he spoke in a clear manner, he\r\nadduced such excellent reasons that convinced everybody. They listened to\r\nhim attentively. Skirwoillo raised his brows now and then as an\r\naffirmative sign; at times he murmured: \"Well spoken.\" Finally he moved\r\nhis big head between his broad shoulders so that he looked like a\r\nhunchback, and was absorbed in thought.\r\n\r\nThen he rose, said nothing, and began to take leave.\r\n\r\n\"How then will it be, prince?\" inquired Macko. \"Whither shall we move?\"\r\n\r\nBut he replied briefly:\r\n\r\n\"To Nowe Kowno.\"\r\n\r\nThen he left the tent.\r\n\r\nMacko and the Bohemian looked at each other for some time in surprise;\r\nthen the old knight placed his hands upon his thighs and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Phew! What a hard stump!... He listens, listens and yet keeps his mouth\r\nshut.\"\r\n\r\n\"I heard before that he is such a man,\" replied Zbyszko. \"To tell the\r\ntruth all people here are obstinate; like the little fellow, they listen\r\nto the reasoning of others, then ... it is like blowing in the air.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why does he consult us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because we are belted knights and he wants to hear the thing argued on\r\nboth sides. But he is not a fool.\"\r\n\r\n\"Also near Nowe Kowno we are least expected,\" observed the Bohemian, \"for\r\nthe very reason that they have beaten you. In that he is right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, let us see the people whom I lead,\" said Zbyszko, \"because the air\r\nin the tent is too close. I want to tell them to be ready.\"\r\n\r\nThey went out. A cloudy and dark night had set in, the scene was only lit\r\nup by the fire around which the Zmudzians were sitting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nMacko and Zbyszko had seen enough of Lithuanian and Zmudz warriors when\r\nserving under Prince Witold. The sights of the encampment were nothing\r\nnew to them. But the Bohemian looked at them with curiosity. He pondered\r\nboth upon the possibility of their fighting qualities and compared them\r\nwith the Polish and German knights. The camp was situated on a plain\r\nsurrounded by forests and swamps, which rendered it impregnable, because\r\nnone could wade through that treacherous marsh land. Even the place where\r\nthe booths were situated was quaggy and muddy, but the soldiers had\r\ncovered it with a thick layer of chips and branches of fir and\r\npine-trees, which enabled them to camp upon it as upon perfectly dry\r\nground. For Prince Skirwoillo they had hastily constructed a Lithuanian\r\n_numy_, constructed of earth and logs, and for the most important\r\npersonages scores of booths of twisted branches. But the common soldiers\r\nwere squatting in the open around the camp-fires, and for shelter against\r\nbad weather they only had goatskin coats, and skins upon their naked\r\nbodies. None had gone to sleep yet; they had nothing to do, after\r\nyesterday's defeat, and had thrown up earthworks during the day. Some of\r\nthem were sitting or lying around the bright fire which they fed with dry\r\njuniper branches. Others were scraping in the ashes and cinders from\r\nwhich proceeded a smell of baked turnips, which form the ordinary food of\r\nthe Lithuanians, and the strong odor of burned meat. Between the\r\ncamp-fires were piles of arms; they were close at hand so that in case of\r\nneed it would be an easy matter for everybody to reach his own weapon.\r\nHlawa looked with curiosity upon the lances with narrow and long heads\r\nmade of tempered iron, and the handles of oak saplings, studded with\r\nflint or nails, hatchets with short handles like the Polish axes used by\r\ntravelers, and others with handles almost as long as those of the\r\nbattle-axes used by the foot-soldiers. There were also among them some\r\nbronze weapons from ancient times when iron was not yet employed in that\r\nlow country. Some swords were entirely made of bronze, but most of them\r\nwere of good steel of Novgorod. The Bohemian handled the spears, swords,\r\nhatchets, axes and tarred bows, examining them closely by the light of\r\nthe camp-fires. There were a few horses near the fires, whilst the cattle\r\ngrazed at a distance in the forests and meadows, under the care of\r\nvigilant ostlers; but the great nobles liked to have their chargers close\r\nat hand, hence there were about twoscore horses within the camp, fed by\r\nhand by the slaves of the noblemen in a space enclosed by stacked arms.\r\nHlawa was amazed at the sight of the extraordinarily small shaggy\r\nchargers, with powerful necks, such strange brutes that the western\r\nknights took them to be quite another species of wild beast, more like a\r\nunicorn than a horse.\r\n\r\n\"Big battle horses are of no use here,\" said the experienced Macko,\r\nrecollecting his former service under Witold, \"because large horses would\r\nat once stick in the mire, but the native nag goes everywhere, like the\r\nmen.\"\r\n\r\n\"But in the field,\" replied the Bohemian, \"the native horse could not\r\nwithstand that of the German.\"\r\n\r\n\"True, he may not be able to withstand, but, on the other hand, the\r\nGerman could not run away from the Zmudzian, neither could he catch him;\r\nthey are very swift, swifter than those of the Tartars.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless I wonder; because when I saw the Tartar captives whom Lord\r\nZych brought to Zgorzelice, they were small and matched their horses; but\r\nthese are big men.\"\r\n\r\nThe men were tall indeed; their broad chests and strong arms could be\r\nseen under their goatskin coats; they were not stout, but bony and\r\nsinewy, and as a rule they excelled the inhabitants of other parts of\r\nLithuania, because they lived in better and more productive lands, and\r\nwere seldom subject to the dearth which often afflicted Lithuania. On the\r\nother hand they were wilder than the other Lithuanians. The court of the\r\nchief prince was at Wilno, whither the princes from the east and west,\r\nand ambassadors and foreign merchants came, and that contributed somewhat\r\nto lessen the roughness of the inhabitants of the city and neighborhood.\r\nThere the stranger only appeared in the form of a Knight of the Cross or\r\na sworded cavalier, carrying to the settlements in the deep forests fire,\r\nslavery and baptism of blood. That was the reason that the people in that\r\npart of the country were very coarse and rude, more like those of ancient\r\ntimes, and very much opposed to everything new, the oldest custom and the\r\noldest warrior clan were theirs, and the reason that paganism was\r\nsupported was that the worship of the cross did not bring the\r\nannouncement of good tidings with apostolic love, but armed German monks\r\ninstead, possessing souls of executioners.\r\n\r\nSkirwoilla and the most notable princes and nobles were already\r\nChristians, because they followed the example of Jagiello and Witold.\r\nOthers even among the common and uncivilized warriors felt in their\r\nhearts that the death-knell of the old world and religion had sounded.\r\nThey were ready to bend their heads to the cross, but not to that cross\r\nwhich the Germans carried, not to the hand of the enemy. \"We ask\r\nbaptism,\" they proclaimed to all princes and nations, \"but bear in mind\r\nthat we are human beings, not beasts, that can be given away, bought or\r\nsold.\" Meanwhile, when their old faith was extinguished, as a fire goes\r\nout for lack of fuel, their hearts were again turned away simply because\r\nthe religion was forced upon them by the Germans, and there was a general\r\nsense of deep sorrow for the future.\r\n\r\nThe Bohemian, who had been accustomed from his infancy to hear the jovial\r\nnoise of the soldiers, and had grown up among songs and music, observed\r\nfor the first time the unusual quiet and gloom in the Lithuanian camp.\r\nHere and there, far away from the camp-fires of Skirwoilla, the sound of\r\na whistle or fife was heard, or the suppressed notes of the song of the\r\n_burtenikas_, to which the soldiers listened with bent heads and eyes\r\nfixed on the glowing fire. Some crouched around the fire with their\r\nelbows upon their knees and their faces hidden in their hands, and\r\ncovered with skins, which made them look like wild beasts of the forest.\r\nBut when they turned their heads toward the approaching knights, one saw\r\nfrom their mild expression and blue pupils that they were not at all\r\nsavage or austere, but looked more like sorrowful and wronged children.\r\nAt the outskirts of the camp the wounded of the last battle lay upon\r\nmoss. _Labdarysi_ and _Sextonowi,_ conjurers and soothsayers, muttered\r\nexorcisms over them or attended to their wounds, to which they applied\r\ncertain healing herbs; the wounded lay quietly, patiently suffering pain\r\nand torture. From the depth of the forest, across the marshes and lakes,\r\ncame the whistling of the ostlers; now and then the wind arose, driving\r\nthe smoke of the camp-fires and making the dark forest resound. The night\r\nwas already far advanced and the camp-fires began to burn down and\r\nextinguish, which increased the dominating silence and intensified the\r\nimpression of sadness, almost to a crushing extent.\r\n\r\nZbyszko gave orders to the people he led, who easily understood him\r\nbecause there were a few Poles among them. Then he turned to his\r\narmor-bearer and said:\r\n\r\n\"You have seen enough, now it is time to return to the tent.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have seen,\" replied Hlawa, \"but I am not satisfied with what I have\r\nobserved, for it is obvious that they are a defeated people.\"\r\n\r\n\"Twice,--four days in front of the castle, and the day before yesterday\r\nat the crossing. Now Skirwoilla wants to go a third time to experience\r\nanother rout.\"\r\n\r\n\"How is it that he does not see that he cannot fight the Germans with\r\nsuch soldiers? Pan Macko told me the same thing, and now I observe myself\r\nthat they are a poor lot, and that they must be boys in battle.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are mistaken in that, because they are a brave people and have few\r\nequals, but they fight in disordered crowds, whilst the Germans fight in\r\nbattle array. If the Zmudzians succeed in breaking the German ranks, then\r\nthe Germans suffer more than themselves. Bah, but the latter know this\r\nand close their ranks in such a manner that they stand like a wall.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must not even think about capturing the castles,\" said Hlawa.\r\n\r\n\"Because there are no engines of war whatever to attempt it,\" replied\r\nZbyszko. \"Prince Witold has them, but as long as he does not arrive I am\r\nunable to capture them, unless by accident or treachery.\"\r\n\r\nThen they reached the tent, in front of which burned a huge fire, and\r\nwithin they found smoking dishes of meat, which the servants had prepared\r\nfor them. It was cold and damp in the tent, therefore the knights and\r\nHlawa lay down upon skins in front of the fire.\r\n\r\nWhen they had fortified themselves, they tried to sleep, but they could\r\nnot; Macko turned from side to side, and when he observed Zbyszko sitting\r\nnear the fire covering his knees with twigs, he asked:\r\n\r\n\"Listen! Why did you give advice to go as far as Ragnety against\r\nGotteswerder, and not near here? What do you profit by it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because there is a voice within me which tells me that Danuska is at\r\nRagnety, and they are guarded less than they are here.\"\r\n\r\n\"There was no time to continue the conversation then, for I too was\r\nfatigued and the people after the defeat gathered in the woods. But now,\r\ntell me, how is it? Do you mean to search for the girl forever?\"\r\n\r\n\"I say that she is not a girl, but my wife,\" replied Zbyszko.\r\n\r\nThere was silence, for Macko well understood that there was no answer to\r\nthat. If Danuska were still Jurandowna (Miss Jurand) Macko might have\r\nadvised his nephew to abandon her: but in the presence of the Holy\r\nSacrament, his search for her was his simple duty. Macko would not have\r\nput the question to him if he had been present.\r\n\r\nNot having been there he always spoke of her at the betrothal or marriage\r\nas a girl.\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" he said, after a while. \"But to all my questions during the\r\nlast two days, you replied that you knew nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I do know nothing, except that the wrath of God is probably upon\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nThen Hlawa lifted up his head from the bearskin, sat up and listened with\r\ncuriosity and attention.\r\n\r\nAnd Macko said:\r\n\r\n\"As long as sleep does not overpower you, tell me what have you seen,\r\nwhat have you done, and what success have you had at Malborg?\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko stroked his long, untrimmed hair from his brow, remained silent\r\nfor a moment, and then said:\r\n\r\n\"Would to God that I knew as much of Danuska as I do of Malborg. You ask\r\nme what I have seen there? I have seen the immense power of the Knights\r\nof the Cross; it is supported by all kings and nations, and I do not know\r\nany one who could measure himself with it. I have seen their castles,\r\nwhich even Caesar of Rome does not possess. I have seen inexhaustible\r\ntreasures, I have seen arms, I have seen swarms of armed monks, knights,\r\nand common soldiers,--and as many relics as one sees with the Holy Father\r\nin Rome, and I tell you that my soul trembled within me at the thought of\r\nthe possibility of fighting them. Who can prevail against them? Who can\r\noppose them and break their power?\"\r\n\r\n\"We must destroy them,\" exclaimed the Bohemian, who could restrain\r\nhimself no longer.\r\n\r\nZbyszko's words appeared strange also to Macko, and although he was\r\nanxious to hear all the adventures of the young man, nevertheless, he\r\ninterrupted him and said:\r\n\r\n\"Have you forgotten Wilno? How many times we threw ourselves against\r\nthem, shield against shield, head against head! You have also seen that,\r\nhow slow they were against us; and, at our hardiness, they exclaimed that\r\nit was not enough to let the horses sweat and break the lances, but it\r\nwas necessary to take the strangers by the throat or offer their own.\r\nSurely there were also guests who challenged us. But all of them went\r\naway with shame. What has caused you to change?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not changed, for I fought at Malborg where also they tilted with\r\nsharp weapons. But you don't know their whole strength.\"\r\n\r\nBut the old knight got angry and said:\r\n\r\n\"Do you know the whole strength of Poland? Did you see all the regiments\r\ntogether? Well, you did not. But their strength consists in the people's\r\nwrongs and treachery; there, they do not even possess one span of land.\r\nThey received our princes there in the same manner as a beggar receives\r\nin his house, and they presented gifts, but they have grown powerful,\r\nthey have bitten the hand which fed them, like abominable mad dogs. They\r\nseized the lands and treacherously captured the city; that is their\r\nstrength. The day of judgment and vengeance is at hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"You requested me to tell you what I have seen, and now you get angry; I\r\nprefer to tell no more,\" said Zbyszko.\r\n\r\nBut Macko breathed angrily for a while, then he quieted down and said:\r\n\r\n\"But this time, thus it will be: You see a tremendous tower-like\r\npine-tree in the forest; it seems as it will stand there forever; but\r\nstrike it fairly with your axe and it will reveal hollowness and punk\r\nwill come out. So is it with the strength of the Knights of the Cross.\r\nBut I commanded you to tell me what you have done and what you have\r\naccomplished there. Let me see, you said you fought there with weapons,\r\ndid you not?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did. They received me at first in an ungrateful and arrogant manner;\r\nthey knew of my fight with Rotgier. Perhaps they had planned some evil\r\nagainst me. But I came provided with letters from the prince; and de\r\nLorche, whom they honor, protected me from their evil designs. Then came\r\nfeasts and tourneys in which the Lord Jesus helped me. You have already\r\nheard how Ulrych, the brother of the grand master, loved me, and obtained\r\nan order from the master himself to surrender Danuska to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"We were told,\" said Macko, \"that when his saddle-girdle broke, you would\r\nnot attack him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I helped him up with my lance, and from that moment he became fond of\r\nme. Hey! Good God! They furnished me with such strong letters, that\r\nenabled me to travel from castle to castle and search. I thought then\r\nthat my sufferings were at an end, but now I am sitting here, in a wild\r\ncountry, without any help, in sorrow and perplexity, and it is getting\r\nworse daily.\"\r\n\r\nHe remained silent for a moment, then he forcibly threw a chip into the\r\nfire which scattered sparks among the burning brands, and said:\r\n\r\n\"If that poor child is suffering in a castle, somewhere in this\r\nneighborhood, and thinks that I don't care for her, then let sudden death\r\novertake me!\"\r\n\r\nHis heart was evidently so full of pain and impatience that he began\r\nagain to throw chips into the fire, as though carried away by a sudden\r\nand blind pain; but they were greatly astonished because they had not\r\nrealized that he loved Danusia so much.\r\n\r\n\"Restrain yourself,\" exclaimed Macko. \"How did you fare with those\r\nletters of safe conduct. Did the _comthurs_ pay no attention to the\r\nmaster's command?\"\r\n\r\n\"Restrain yourself, sir,\" said Hlawa. \"God will comfort you; perhaps very\r\nsoon.\"\r\n\r\nTears glistened in Zbyszko's eyes, but he controlled himself, and said:\r\n\r\n\"They opened different castles and prisons. I have been everywhere; I\r\nsearched up to the breaking out of this war. At Gierdaw I was told by the\r\nmagistrate, von Heideck, that the laws of war differ from those in time\r\nof peace, and that my safe conduct was of no avail. I challenged him at\r\nonce, but he did not accept, and he ordered me to quit the castle.\"\r\n\r\n\"What happened in other places?\" inquired Macko.\r\n\r\n\"It was the same everywhere. The Count Könizsberg, who is the chief\r\nmagistrate of Gierdaw, even refused to read the letter of the master,\r\nsaying that 'war is war,' and told me to carry my head--while it was\r\nintact--out of the place. It was everywhere the same.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now I understand,\" said the old knight, \"seeing that you got nothing,\r\nyou came here at least to avenge yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly so,\" replied Zbyszko. \"I also thought that we should take\r\nprisoners, and also invest some castles. But those fellows could not\r\nconquer castles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hey! It will be otherwise when Prince Witold himself comes.\"\r\n\r\n\"May God grant it!\"\r\n\r\n\"He will come; I heard at the Mazovian court that he will come, and\r\nperhaps the king and all the forces of Poland will come with him.\"\r\n\r\nFurther conversation was interrupted by the appearance of Skirwoilla who\r\nunexpectedly appeared from the shadow, and said:\r\n\r\n\"We must be on the march.\"\r\n\r\nHearing that, the knights got up with alacrity. Skirwoilla approached his\r\ntremendous head to their faces, and said in low tones:\r\n\r\n\"There is news: A relief train is moving toward New Kowno. Two knights\r\nare at the head of the soldiers, cattle and provisions. Let us capture\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall we cross the Niemen,\" inquired Zbyszko.\r\n\r\n\"Yes! I know a ford.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do they know at the castle of the relief train?\"\r\n\r\n\"They know and will come to meet them, but we shall pounce upon them\r\ntoo.\"\r\n\r\nThen he instructed them where they were to lie in ambush, so as to\r\nattack, unexpectedly, those hurrying from the castle. His intentions were\r\nto engage the enemy in two battles at the same time, and avenge himself\r\nfor the last defeat, which could easily be effected, considering that\r\nowing to their last victory the enemy considered himself perfectly safe\r\nfrom an attack. Therefore Skirwoilla appointed the place and time where\r\nthey should meet; as for the rest, he left it with them, for he relied\r\nupon their courage and resource. They were very glad at heart because\r\nthey appreciated the fact that an experienced and skilful warrior was\r\nspeaking to them. Then he ordered them to start, and he went to his\r\n_numy_ where the princes and captains were already waiting. There he\r\nrepeated his orders, gave new ones, and finally put to his lips a pipe,\r\ncarved out of a wolf's bone, and whistled shrilly, which was heard from\r\none end of the camp to the other.\r\n\r\nAt the sound of the whistle they gathered around the extinguished\r\ncamp-fires; here and there sparks shot up, then little flames which\r\nincreased momentarily, and wild figures of warriors were visible\r\ngathering around the stands of arms. The forest throbbed and moved. In a\r\nmoment there were heard the voices of the ostlers chasing the herd toward\r\nthe camp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nThey arrived very early at Niewiazy where they crossed the river, some on\r\nhorseback, some upon bundles of osier. Everything went with such dispatch\r\nthat Macko, Zbyszko, Hlawa and the Mazovian volunteers were astonished at\r\nthe skilfulness of the people; only then they understood why neither\r\nwoods, nor swamps, nor rivers could prevent Lithuanian expeditions. When\r\nthey emerged from the river none had taken off his wet clothing, not even\r\nthe sheep and wolfskin coats, but exposed themselves to the rays of the\r\nsun until they steamed like pitch-burners, and after a short rest they\r\nmarched hastily toward the north. At nightfall they arrived at the\r\nNiemen.\r\n\r\nThe crossing of the great river at that place, swollen in the spring, was\r\nnot an easy matter. The ford, which was known to Skuwoilla, changed in\r\nplaces into deep water, so that the horses had to swim more than a\r\nquarter of a furlong. Two men were carried away quite near Zbyszko, and\r\nHlawa tried to rescue them, but in vain; owing to the darkness and the\r\nrushing water they lost sight of them. The drowning men did not dare to\r\nshout for help, because the leader had previously ordered that the\r\ncrossing should be effected in the most quiet manner possible.\r\nNevertheless all the others fortunately succeeded in reaching the other\r\nside of the river, where they remained without fires till the morning.\r\n\r\nAt dawn, the whole army was divided into two divisions. Skirwoilla at the\r\nhead of one went toward the interior to encounter the knights at the head\r\nof the relief train for Gotteswerder. The second division was led back by\r\nZbyszko, toward the island, in order to attack the people coming from the\r\ncastle to meet the expedition, upon the elevated ground.\r\n\r\nIt was a mild and bright morning, but down in the woods the marshes and\r\nbushes were covered with a thick white steam which entirely obscured the\r\ndistance. That was just a desirable condition for Zbyszko, because the\r\nGermans coming from the castle would not be able to see them in time to\r\nretreat. The young knight was exceedingly glad of it, and said to Macko:\r\n\r\n\"Let us get to our position instead of contemplating the mist yonder. God\r\ngrant that it is not dissipated before noon.\"\r\n\r\nThen he hurried to the front to give orders to the _setniks_,[116] and\r\nimmediately returned and said:\r\n\r\n\"We shall soon meet them upon the road coming from the ferry of the\r\nisland toward the interior. There we shall hide ourselves in the thicket\r\nand watch for them.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know about that road?\" asked Macko.\r\n\r\n\"We got the information from the local peasants, of whom we have quite a\r\nnumber among our people who will guide us everywhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"At what distance from the castle do you intend to attack?\"\r\n\r\n\"About one mile from it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well; because if it were nearer, the soldiers from the castle might\r\nhurry to the rescue, but now they will not only not be able to arrive in\r\ntime, but will be beyond hearing distance.\"\r\n\r\n\"You see I thought about that.\"\r\n\r\n\"You thought about one thing, think also about another: if they are\r\nreliable peasants, send two or three of them in front, so as to signal\r\nwhen they descry the Germans coming.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah! That also has been attended to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, I have yet something else to tell you; order one or two hundred\r\nmen, as soon as the battle begins, not to take part in the fight, but\r\nhasten to the rear and cut off their retreat to the island.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is the first thing,\" replied Zbyszko. \"Those orders have been\r\ngiven. The Germans will fall into a trap and be snared.\"\r\n\r\nHearing this, Macko looked approvingly at his nephew; he was pleased that\r\nin spite of his youth, he understood much of warfare; therefore he smiled\r\nand murmured:\r\n\r\n\"Our true blood!\"\r\n\r\nBut Hlawa, the shield-bearer, was more glad than Macko, because there was\r\nnothing he loved more than war.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know the fighting capacity of our people,\" he said, \"but they\r\nmarch quietly, they are dexterous, and they seem to be eager. And if\r\nSkirwoilla yonder has well devised his plans, then not a single foot\r\nshall escape.\"\r\n\r\n\"God grant that only a few may escape,\" replied Zbyszko. \"But I have\r\ngiven orders to capture as many prisoners as possible; and if there\r\nshould happen to be a knight or a religious brother among them, he must\r\nabsolutely not be killed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not, sir?\" inquired the Bohemian.\r\n\r\n\"You also take care,\" Zbyszko replied, \"that it be so. If there be a\r\nknight among them, he must possess much information, owing to his\r\nwanderings in many cities and castles, seeing, and hearing much; much\r\nmore so if he is a religious member of the Order. Therefore I owe to God\r\nmy coming to this place so that I might learn something about Danusia,\r\nand exchange prisoners. If there be any, this is the only measure left\r\nfor me.\"\r\n\r\nThen he urged his horse and galloped again to the front to give his final\r\norders and at the same time to get rid of his sad thoughts; there was no\r\ntime to be lost, because the spot where they were to lie in ambush was\r\nvery near.\r\n\r\n\"Why does the young lord think that his little wife is alive, and that\r\nshe is somewhere in this neighborhood?\" asked the Bohemian.\r\n\r\n\"Because if Zygfried, at the first impulse, did not kill her at\r\nSzczytno,\" replied Macko, \"then one may rightly conclude that she is\r\nstill alive. The priest of Szczytno would not have told us what he did,\r\nin the presence of Zbyszko, if she had been killed. It is a very\r\ndifficult matter; even the most cruel man would not lift up his hand\r\nagainst a defenceless woman. Bah! Against an innocent child.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a hard thing, but not with the Knights of the Cross. And the\r\nchildren of Prince Witold?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is quite true, they have wolfish hearts. Nevertheless, it is true\r\nthat they did not kill her at Szczytno, and Zygfried himself left for\r\nthis part of the country; it is therefore possible that he had hid her in\r\nsome castle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hey! If it turns out so, then I shall take this island and the castle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Only look at this people,\" said Macko.\r\n\r\n\"Surely, surely; but I have an idea that I will communicate to the young\r\nlord.\"\r\n\r\n\"Even if you have ten ideas, I do not care. You cannot overthrow the\r\nwalls with pikes.\"\r\n\r\nMacko pointed toward the lines of pikes, with which most of the warriors\r\nwere provided; then he asked:\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever see such soldiers?\"\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the Bohemian had never seen the like. There was a\r\ndense crowd in front of them marching irregularly. Cavalry and infantry\r\nwere mixed up and could not keep proper steps while marching through the\r\nundergrowth in the woods. In order to keep pace with the cavalry the\r\ninfantry held on to the horses' manes, saddles and tails. The warriors'\r\nshoulders were covered with wolf, lynx and bearskins; some had attached\r\nto their heads boars' tusks, others antlers of deer, and others still had\r\nshaggy ears attached, so that, were it not for the protruding weapons\r\nabove their heads, and the dingy bows and arrows at their backs, they\r\nwould have looked from the rear and specially in the mist like a moving\r\nbody of wild beasts proceeding from the depths of the forest, driven by\r\nthe desire for blood or hunger, in search of prey. There was something\r\nterrible and at the same time extraordinary in it: it had the appearance\r\nof that wonder called _gnomon_, when, according to popular belief, wild\r\nbeasts and even stones and bushes were moving in front of them.\r\n\r\nIt was at that sight that one of the young nobles from Lenkawice, who\r\naccompanied the Bohemian, approached him, crossed himself, and said:\r\n\r\n\"In the name of the Father and Son! I say I am marching with a pack of\r\nwolves, and not with men.\"\r\n\r\nBut Hlawa, although he had never before seen such a sight, replied like\r\nan experienced man who knows all about it and is not surprised at\r\nanything.\r\n\r\n\"Wolves roam in packs during the winter season, but the dog-blood of the\r\nKnights of the Cross they also taste in the spring.\"\r\n\r\nIt was spring indeed, the month of May; the hazel-trees which filled the\r\nwoods were covered with a bright green. Among the moss, upon which the\r\nsoldiers stepped noiselessly, appeared white and blue anemones as well as\r\nyoung berries and dentillated ferns. Softened by abundant rains, the bark\r\nof the trees produced an agreeable odor, and from the forest under foot,\r\nconsisting of pine-needles and punk, proceeded a pungent smell. The sun\r\ndisplayed a rainbow in the drops upon the leaves and branches of the\r\ntrees, and above it the birds sang joyfully.\r\n\r\nThey accelerated their pace, because Zbyszko urged them on. At times\r\nZbyszko rode again in the rear of the division with Macko, the Bohemian\r\nand the Mazovian volunteers. The prospect of a good battle apparently\r\nelated him considerably, for his customary sad expression had\r\ndisappeared, and his eyes had regained their wonted brightness.\r\n\r\n\"Cheer up!\" he exclaimed. \"We must now place ourselves in the front--not\r\nbehind the line.\"\r\n\r\nHe led them to the front of the division.\r\n\r\n\"Listen,\" he added. \"It may be that we shall catch the Germans\r\nunexpectedly, but should they make a stand and succeed in falling in\r\nline, then we must be the first to attack them, because our armor is\r\nsuperior, and our swords are better.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let it be so,\" said Macko.\r\n\r\nThe others settled themselves in their saddles, as if they were to attack\r\nat once. They took a long breath, and felt for their swords to see\r\nwhether they could be unsheathed with ease.\r\n\r\nZbyszko repeated his orders once more, that if they found among the\r\ninfantry any knights with white mantles over the armor, they were not to\r\nkill but capture them alive; then he galloped to the guides, and halted\r\nthe division for a while.\r\n\r\nThey arrived at the highway which from the landing opposite the island\r\nextended to the interior. Strictly speaking, there was no proper road\r\nyet, but in reality the edge of the wood had been recently sawed through\r\nand leveled only at the rear so much as to enable soldiers or wagons to\r\npass over them. On both sides of the road rose the high trunked trees,\r\nand the old pines cut for the widening of the road. The hazelnut growths\r\nwere so thick in some places that they overran the whole forest. Zbyszko\r\nhad therefore chosen a place at the turning, so that the advancing party\r\nwould neither be able to see far, nor retreat, nor have time enough to\r\nform themselves in battle array. It was there that he occupied both sides\r\nof the lane and gave commands to await the enemy.\r\n\r\nAccustomed to forest life and war, the Zmudzians took advantage of the\r\nlogs, cuts and clumps of young hazelnut growths, and fir saplings--so\r\nthat it seemed as if the earth had swallowed them up. No one spoke,\r\nneither did the horses snort. Now and then, big and little forest animals\r\npassed those lying in wait and came upon them before seeing them and were\r\nfrightened and rushed wildly away. At times the wind arose and filled the\r\nforest with a solemn, rushing sound, and then again silence fell and only\r\nthe distant notes of the cuckoo and the woodpecker were audible.\r\n\r\nThe Zmudzians were glad to hear those sounds, because the woodpecker was\r\na special harbinger of good fortune. There were many of those birds in\r\nthat forest, and the pecking sound was heard on all sides persistent and\r\nrapid, like human labor. One would be inclined to say, that each of those\r\nbirds had its own blacksmith's forge where it went to active labor very\r\nearly. It appeared to Macko and the Mazovians that they heard the noise\r\nof carpenters fixing roofs upon new houses, and it reminded them of home.\r\n\r\nBut the time passed and grew tedious; nothing was heard but the noise of\r\nthe trees and the voice of birds. The mist hovering upon the plain was\r\nlifting. The sun was quite high and it was getting hot, but they still\r\nlay in wait. Finally Hlawa who was impatient at the silence and delay,\r\nbent toward Zbyszko's ear and whispered:\r\n\r\n\"Sir, if God will grant, none of the dog-brothers shall escape alive. May\r\nwe not be able to reach the castle and capture it by surprise?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you suppose that the boats there are not watching, and have no\r\nwatchwords?\"\r\n\r\n\"They have watchmen,\" replied the Bohemian, in a whisper, \"but prisoners\r\nwhen threatened with the knife will give up the watchword. Bah! they will\r\neven reply in the German language. If we reach the island, then the\r\ncastle itself....\"\r\n\r\nHere he stopped, because Zbyszko put his hand upon his mouth, because\r\nfrom the roadside came the croak of a raven.\r\n\r\n\"Hush!\" he said. \"That is a signal.\"\r\n\r\nAbout two \"paters\" later, there appeared at the border a Zmudzian, riding\r\nupon a little shaggy pony, whose hoofs were enveloped in sheepskin to\r\navoid the clatter and traces of horses' hoofs in the mud. The rider\r\nlooked sharply from side to side and, suddenly hearing from the thicket\r\nan answer to the croaking, dived into the forest, and in a moment he was\r\nnear Zbyszko.\r\n\r\n\"They are coming!\" ... he said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nZbyszko inquired hurriedly, how many horsemen and infantry were among\r\nthem, in what manner they were advancing, and above all the exact\r\ndistance; and he learned from the Zmudzian that their number did not\r\nexceed one hundred and fifty warriors and that about fifty of that number\r\nwere horsemen led by a Knight of the Cross, who appears to be of the\r\nsecular knights; that they were marching in ranks and had empty wagons\r\nwith a supply of wheels upon them; and that at a distance in front of the\r\ndetachment were bodies of archers composed of eight men who frequently\r\nleft the road and searched the woods and thickets, and finally that the\r\ndetachment was about one quarter of a mile distant.\r\n\r\nZbyszko was not particularly pleased with the information of the manner\r\nof their advancing in battle array. He knew by experience how difficult\r\nit was to break the ordered German ranks, and how such a crowd could\r\nretreat and fight in the same manner as a wild-boar that defends itself\r\nwhen brought to bay by dogs. On the other hand, he was glad of the news\r\nthat they were only a quarter of a mile distant, because he calculated\r\nthat the people who were detached to cut off their retreat had already\r\ndone so,--and, in case of the Germans being routed, not a single soul\r\ncould escape. As to the outpost at the head of the detachment he did not\r\ncare much, because he knew from the first that such would be the case and\r\nwas prepared for them; he had given orders to his men to allow them to\r\nadvance, and if they were engaged in searching the thickets to capture\r\nthem quietly one by one.\r\n\r\nBut the last order seemed unnecessary; the scouts advanced without delay.\r\nThe Zmudzians who were hidden in the growths near the highway had a\r\nperfect view of the advancing party when they halted at the turning and\r\ntook counsel. The chief, a powerful red-bearded German, who signalled to\r\nthem to keep silence, began to listen. It was visible for a moment that\r\nhe hesitated whether to penetrate the forest or not. At last, as there\r\nwas only audible the hammering of the woodpeckers, and he apparently\r\nthought that the birds would not be working so freely if people were\r\nhidden among the trees. Therefore he waved his hand for the detachment to\r\ngo forward.\r\n\r\nZbyszko waited until they were near the second turning, then he\r\napproached the road, at the head of his well-armed men, including Macko,\r\nthe Bohemian, and the two noble volunteers from Lenkawice, and three\r\nyoung knights from Ciechanow, and a dozen of the better armed Zmudzian\r\nnobles. Further concealment was not necessary. Nothing remained for\r\nZbyszko but to station himself in the middle of the road and, as soon as\r\nthe Germans appeared, to fall upon them, and break their ranks. If that\r\nmight be accomplished, he was sure that his Zmudzians would take care of\r\nthe Germans.\r\n\r\nThere was silence for a little while, which was only disturbed by the\r\nusual forest noises, but soon there were heard the voices of people\r\nproceeding from the east side; they were yet a considerable distance away\r\nbut the voices grew little by little more distinct as they approached.\r\n\r\nWithout losing a moment's time, Zbyszko and his men placed themselves in\r\nthe form of a wedge in the middle of the road. Zbyszko himself formed the\r\nsharp end and directly behind him were Macko and the Bohemian, in the row\r\nbehind them were three men, behind those were four; all of them were well\r\narmed. Nothing was wanting but the \"wooden\" lances of the knights which\r\ncould greatly impede the advance of the enemy in forest marches, instead\r\nof those long handled lances; theirs were shorter and lighter. Zmudzian\r\nweapons were well adapted for the first attack, and the swords and axes\r\nat their saddles were handy for combat at close quarters.\r\n\r\nHlawa was wide awake and listening; then he whispered to Macko:\r\n\r\n\"They are singing, they shall be destroyed.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what surprises me is that the woods obscure them from our sight,\"\r\nreplied Macko.\r\n\r\nThen Zbyszko, who considered further hiding and silence unnecessary,\r\nreplied:\r\n\r\n\"Because the road leads along the stream; that is the reason for its\r\nfrequent windings.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how merrily they are singing!\" repeated the Bohemian.\r\n\r\nOne could judge from the melody that the Germans were singing profane\r\nsongs indeed. It could also be distinguished that the singers were not\r\nmore than about a dozen, and that they all repeated only one burden which\r\nresounded far and wide in the forest, like a thunderstorm.\r\n\r\nThus they went to death, rejoicing and lusty.\r\n\r\n\"We shall soon see them,\" said Macko.\r\n\r\nThen his face suddenly darkened and assumed a wolf-like and savage\r\nexpression. He had a grudge against the knights for the shots which he\r\nhad received at the time when he went to Zbyszko's rescue, on that\r\noccasion when he was the carrier of letters from Prince Witold's sister\r\nto the grand master. Therefore his blood began to boil, and a desire for\r\nvengeance overflowed his soul.\r\n\r\nThe fellow who first attacks will not fare well, thought Hlawa, as he\r\nlooked at the old knight.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the wind carried the sound of the phrase which the singers\r\nrepeated:\r\n\r\n\"Tandaradei! Tandaradei!\" The Bohemian at once recognized the song known\r\nto him:\r\n\r\n  \"Bi den rôsen er wol mac\r\n      Tandaradei!\r\n  Merken wa mir'z houlet lac....\"\r\n\r\nThen the song was interrupted, because upon both sides of the road was\r\nheard such a croaking noise that it seemed as if the crows were holding\r\nparliament in that corner of the forest. The Germans were wondering\r\nwhence so many crows came, and why they proceeded from the ground and not\r\nfrom the tops of the trees. In fact the first line of the soldiers\r\nappeared at the turning and halted as though nailed to the spot, when\r\nthey observed unknown horsemen facing them.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment Zbyszko sat down in his saddle, spurred his horse, and\r\nrushed forward, crying:\r\n\r\n\"At them!\"\r\n\r\nThe others galloped with him. The terrible shouting of the Zmudzian\r\nwarriors was heard from the woods. Only a space of about two hundred feet\r\nseparated Zbyszko from the enemy, who, in the twinkling of an eye,\r\nlowered a forest of lances toward Zbyszko's horsemen; the remaining lines\r\nplaced themselves with the utmost dispatch on both sides to protect\r\nthemselves against an attack from the direction of the forest. The Polish\r\nknights might have admired the dexterity of the German tactics, but there\r\nwas no time for contemplation, owing to the great speed and impetus of\r\ntheir horses in their charge upon the close phalanx of the Germans.\r\n\r\nHappily for Zbyszko, the German cavalry were in the rear of the division\r\nnear the wagon train; in fact, they hastened at once to their assistance,\r\nbut they could neither reach them in time nor pass beyond them so as to\r\nbe of any assistance at the first attack. The Zmudzians, pouring from the\r\nthickets, surrounded them like a swarm of poisonous wasps upon whose nest\r\na careless traveler had trod. Meanwhile Zbyszko and his men threw\r\nthemselves upon the infantry.\r\n\r\nThe attack was without effect. The Germans planted the ends of their\r\nheavy lances and battle-axes in the ground, held them fast and even so\r\nthat the Zmudzian light horses could not break the wall. Macko's horse,\r\nwhich received a blow from a battle-axe in the shin, reared and stood up\r\non his hind legs, then fell forward burying his nostrils in the ground.\r\nFor a while death was hovering above the old knight; but he was\r\nexperienced and had seen many battles, and was full of resources in\r\naccidents. So he freed his legs from the stirrups, and grasped with his\r\npowerful hand the sharp end of the pike which was ready to strike him,\r\nand instead of penetrating his chest it served him as a support. Then he\r\nfreed himself, and, springing among the horsemen, he obtained a sword and\r\nfell upon the pikes and battle-axes with such fury as an eagle swoops\r\nupon a flock of long-beaked cranes.\r\n\r\nAt the moment of attack Zbyszko sat back on his horse, charged with his\r\nspear--and broke it; then he also got a sword. The Bohemian, who, above\r\nall, believed in the efficacy of an axe, threw it in the midst of the\r\nGermans. For a while he remained without arms. One of two _wlodykas_ who\r\naccompanied him was slain in the onset; at the sight of that, the other\r\nlost his reason and raved so that he began to howl like a wolf, stood up\r\nupon his blood-covered horse and charged blindly into the midst of the\r\nthrong. The Zmudzian noblemen cut with their sharp blades the spearheads\r\nand wooden handles, behind which they observed the faces of the _knechts_\r\n(common soldiers) upon which was depicted alarm, and at the same time\r\nthey were frowning with determination and stubbornness. But the ranks\r\nremained unbroken. Also the Zmudzians, who made a flank attack, quickly\r\nretreated from before the Germans, as one runs away from a venomous\r\nsnake. Indeed they returned immediately with yet greater impetuosity, but\r\nthey did not succeed. Some of them climbed up the trees in the twinkling\r\nof an eye and directed their arrows into the midst of the _knechts_, but\r\nwhen their leader saw this he ordered the soldiers to retreat toward the\r\ncavalry. The German ranks also began to shoot, and from time to time a\r\nZmudzian would fall down and tear the moss in agony, or wriggle like a\r\nfish drawn from the water. The Germans, indeed, could not count upon a\r\nvictory, but they knew the efficacy of defending themselves, so that, if\r\npossible, a small number, at least, might manage to escape disaster and\r\nreach the shore.\r\n\r\nNobody thought of surrendering, because they did not spare prisoners,\r\nthey knew that they could not count upon mercy from people who were\r\ndriven to despair and rebellion. They therefore retreated in silence, in\r\nclose rank, shoulder to shoulder, now raising, now lowering their\r\njavelins and broad axes, hewing, shooting with their crossbows as much as\r\nthe confusion of the fighting permitted them, and continuing to retreat\r\nslowly toward their horsemen, who were engaged in life and death battle\r\nwith another section of the enemy.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile something strange occurred which decided the fortune of the\r\nstubborn fight. It was caused by the young _wlodyka_ of Lenkawice, who\r\nbecame mad at the death of his companion; he did not dismount, but bent\r\ndown and lifted up the body of his companion with the object of\r\ndepositing it in a safe place to save it from mutilation, and so that he\r\nmight find it after the battle was over. But at that very moment a fresh\r\nwave of madness came over him and he entirely lost his mind, so that\r\ninstead of leaving the road, he rushed toward the German soldiers and\r\nthrew the body upon the points of their pikes, which penetrated the\r\ncorpse in various parts, and the weight caused them to bend, and before\r\nthe Germans were able to withdraw their weapons, the raving man fell in,\r\nbreaking the ranks and overturning the men like a tempest.\r\n\r\nIn the twinkling of an eye, half a score of hands were extended toward\r\nhim and as many pikes penetrated the flanks of his horse, but the ranks\r\nwere thrown into disorder, and one Zmudz noble who was near, rushed\r\nthrough and immediately after him came Zbyszko, then the Bohemian, and\r\nthe terrible confusion increased every moment. Other _bojars_ followed\r\nthe example, seized corpses and thrust them against the enemies' arms,\r\nwhilst the Zmudzians again attacked the flanks. The order which had\r\nhitherto reigned in the German ranks wavered; it began to shake like a\r\nhouse whose walls are cracked; it was cleft like a log by a wedge, and\r\nfinally it burst open.\r\n\r\nIn a moment the fighting turned to slaughter, the long German pikes and\r\nbroad axes were of no use at close quarters. Instead of it the swords of\r\nthe horsemen fell upon helmet and neck. The horses pressed into the midst\r\nof the throng, upsetting and trampling the unfortunate Germans. It was\r\neasy for the horsemen to strike from above and they took advantage of the\r\nopportunity and ceaselessly cut the enemy. From the woods on both sides\r\ncontinually arrived wild warriors, clothed in wolves' skins, and with a\r\nwolfish desire for blood in their hearts. Their howling drowned the\r\nvoices praying for mercy and those of the dying. The conquered threw away\r\ntheir arms; some tried to escape into the forest, others feigned death\r\nand fell to the earth, others stood erect, their faces white as snow, and\r\nbloodshot eyes, whilst others prayed. One of them, apparently demented,\r\nbegan to play the pipe, then looked upward and smiled, until a Zmudzian\r\ncrushed his head with a club. The forest ceased to rustle and death\r\ndominated it.\r\n\r\nFinally the small army of the Knights of the Cross melted away; only at\r\ntimes there were heard voices of small bands fighting in the woods, or a\r\nterrible cry of despair. Zbyszko, Macko and all their horsemen now\r\ngalloped toward the cavalry. They were still defending themselves,\r\nplacing themselves in the form of a wedge. The Germans were always\r\naccustomed to adopt that manoeuvre when surrounded by an overwhelming\r\nforce of the enemy. The cavalry were mounted upon good horses and were\r\nbetter armed than the infantry; they fought manfully and obstinately and\r\ndeserved admiration. There was none with a white mantle among them, but\r\nthey were of the middle classes and small nobility of the Germans who\r\nwere obliged to go to war when called upon by the Order. Most of their\r\nhorses were also armed, some had body armor; but all had iron head covers\r\nwith a spike of steel protruding from the centre. Their leader was a\r\ntall, sturdy knight; he wore a dark blue coat of mail and a helmet of the\r\nsame color, with a lowered steel visor.\r\n\r\nA rain of arrows was showered upon them from the depths of the forest.\r\nBut they did but little harm. The Zmudzian infantry and cavalry came\r\nnearer and surrounded them like a wall, but they defended themselves,\r\ncutting and thrusting with their long swords so furiously that in front\r\nof the horses' hoofs lay a ring of corpses. The first lines of the\r\nattackers wanted to retire, but they were unable to do so. There was a\r\npress and confusion all around. The eyes became dazzled by the glint of\r\nthe spears and the flash of the swords. The horses began to neigh, bite,\r\nrear and kick. Then the Zmudz noblemen charged down; Zbyszko, Hlawa and\r\nthe Mazovians fell upon them. By dint of the press, the German throng\r\nbegan to waver, and swayed like trees before a storm, but they hewed like\r\nchoppers of firewood in the forest thickets, and advanced slowly amidst\r\nfatigue and excessive heat.\r\n\r\nBut Macko ordered his men to gather together the long-handled German\r\nbattle-axes from the battlefield, and armed with them thirty of his wild\r\nwarriors pressed on eagerly toward the Germans. \"Strike the horses'\r\nlegs!\" he shouted. A terrible effect was soon apparent. The German\r\nknights were unable to reach the Zmudzians with their swords, at the same\r\ntime the battle-axes were crushing the horses' legs. It was then that the\r\nblue knight recognized that the end of the battle was at hand, and that\r\nhe had only two resources left--either to fight his way through the army\r\nand retreat, or to remain and perish.\r\n\r\nHe chose the first plan, and in a moment his knights turned their faces\r\nin the direction whence they came. The Zmudzians fell upon their rear.\r\nNevertheless the Germans threw their shields upon their shoulders and cut\r\nin front and to the sides, and broke through the ranks of the attacking\r\nparty, and hurricane-like, fled toward the east. But that division which\r\nhad been despatched for that purpose, rushed to meet them; but by dint of\r\nsuperior fighting and the greater weight of the horses, they fell in a\r\nmoment like flax before a storm. The road to the castle was open, but\r\nescape thither was insecure and too far away, because the Zmudzian horses\r\nwere fleeter than those of the Germans. The blue knight was quite aware\r\nof it.\r\n\r\n\"Woe!\" he said to himself. \"Here none will escape; perhaps I may purchase\r\ntheir salvation with my own blood.\"\r\n\r\nThen he shouted to his men to halt, and himself turned around toward the\r\nfoe, not caring whether any one overheard his command.\r\n\r\nZbyszko galloped up to him first, the German struck him upon the visor,\r\nbut without breaking it or harming Zbyszko. At the same time, Zbyszko,\r\ninstead of giving stroke for stroke, grasped the knight by the middle,\r\nbut, in the attempt to take him alive, engaged in a close struggle,\r\nduring which the girth of his horse gave way from the intense strain of\r\nthe contest, and both fell to the ground. For a while they wrestled; but\r\nthe extraordinary strength of the young man soon prevailed against his\r\nantagonist; he pressed his knees against his stomach, holding him down as\r\na wolf does a dog who dares to oppose him in the woods.\r\n\r\nBut there was no need to hold him, because the German fainted. Meanwhile\r\nMacko and the Bohemian arrived at a gallop. Zbyszko shouted: \"Quick,\r\nhere! A rope!\"\r\n\r\nThe Bohemian dismounted, but seeing the helplessness of the German, he\r\ndid not bind him, but disarmed him and unbuckled his armlets and his\r\nbelt, and with the attached \"_misericordia_,\" (dagger of mercy) cut the\r\ngorget, and lastly he unscrewed the helmet.\r\n\r\nBut he had scarcely glanced in the face of the knight, when he started\r\nback and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Master! master! please only look here!\"\r\n\r\n\"De Lorche!\" shouted Zbyszko.\r\n\r\nAnd there lay de Lorche pale and motionless as a corpse, with closed eyes\r\nand face covered with perspiration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nZbyszko gave orders for him to be laid upon one of the captured wagons\r\nwhich were laden with spare wheels and axles for the expedition coming to\r\nrelieve the castle. He mounted another horse, and with Macko they\r\ncontinued the pursuit of the fleeing Germans. It was not a difficult\r\npursuit, because the German horses were not speedy enough, particularly\r\nupon the ground softened by the spring rains, more especially for Macko,\r\nwho had with him a light and fleet mare which belonged to the deceased\r\n_wlodyka_ of Lenkawice. After a distance of several furlongs he passed\r\nalmost all the Zmudzians. He soon reached the first German trooper, whom\r\nhe at once challenged according to the then prevailing custom among the\r\nknights, to surrender or fight. But the German feigned deafness. He even\r\nthrew away his shield to relieve the horse, and bent in the saddle and\r\nspurred his horse. The old knight struck him with his broad axe between\r\nthe shoulder-blades, and he fell to the ground.\r\n\r\nThus Macko avenged himself upon the fleeing Germans for the treacherous\r\nshot he had once received. They ran before him like a herd of frightened\r\ndeer. They had no thought of continuing the fight or defending\r\nthemselves, but of fleeing before that terrible man. Some dashed into the\r\nforest, but one stuck fast near the stream: him the Zmudzians strangled\r\nwith a halter. Then a hunt as if after wild beasts began after the crowd\r\nof fugitives which sprang into the woods.\r\n\r\nThe depths of the forests rang with the shouts of the hunters and the\r\nshrieks of the hunted until the latter were exterminated. Then the old\r\nknight, accompanied by Zbyszko and the Bohemian, returned to the\r\nbattlefield upon which lay the hacked bodies of the German infantry. They\r\nwere already stripped naked. Some were mutilated by the revengeful\r\nZmudzians. It was an important victory, and the soldiers were drunk with\r\njoy. After the last defeat suffered by Skirwoilla near Gotteswerder, a\r\nsort of apathy had seized the Zmudzians, more especially because the\r\npromised relief from Prince Witold had not yet arrived as quickly as\r\nexpected. However, now hope revived and the fire was kindled anew as when\r\nwood is thrown upon glowing embers. The number of slain Germans, as well\r\nas Zmudzians to be buried, was very great, but Zbyszko ordered a special\r\ngrave to be dug for the _wlodykas_ of Lenkawice, who contributed so much\r\ntoward the victory. They were buried there among the pine-trees, and\r\nZbyszko cut a cross with his sword upon the bark. Then he ordered the\r\nBohemian to keep watch over de Lorche who was still unconscious; he\r\nstirred up the people and hurried on along the road toward Skirwoilla to\r\nlend him affective assistance in case of emergency.\r\n\r\nBut after a long march he came across a deserted battlefield that\r\nresembled the former, being covered with German and Zmudzian corpses. It\r\nwas easy for Zbyszko to conclude that the terrible Skirwoilla had also\r\ngained an equally important victory over the enemy, because if he had\r\nbeen defeated, Zbyszko would have met the victorious Germans marching to\r\nthe castle. But the victory must have been a bloody one, because for some\r\ndistance a great number of dead were met with. The experienced Macko was\r\nable to deduce from this that some Germans had even succeeded in\r\nretreating from the defeat.\r\n\r\nIt was difficult to tell whether Skirwoilla was pursuing them or not,\r\nbecause the tracks were mingled and confused. He also concluded that the\r\nbattle had taken place quite early, perhaps earlier than Zbyszko's fight,\r\nfor the corpses were livid and swollen, and some of them torn by wolves,\r\nthat scattered in the thickets at the approach of armed men.\r\n\r\nIn face of these circumstances Zbyszko resolved not to wait for\r\nSkirwoilla, but to return to the original safe camp. He arrived there\r\nlate at night and found the leader of the Zmudzians who had arrived\r\nsomewhat early. His face, which usually wore a sullen expression, was now\r\nlighted with fiendish joy. He asked at once about the result of the\r\nfight, and when he was told of the victory he said in tones that sounded\r\nlike the croaking of a crow:\r\n\r\n\"I am glad of your victory, and I am glad of mine. They will send no more\r\nrelief expeditions for some time, and when the great prince arrives there\r\nwill be more joy, for the castle will be ours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you taken any prisoners?\" inquired Zbyszko.\r\n\r\n\"Only small fry, no pike. There was one, there were two but they got\r\naway. They were pikes with sharp teeth! They cut the people and escaped.\"\r\n\r\n\"God granted me one.\" replied the young knight. \"He is a powerful and\r\nrenowned knight, although a Swede--a guest!\"\r\n\r\nThe terrible Zmudzian raised his hands to his neck and with the right\r\nhand made a gesture like the up-jerk of a halter:\r\n\r\n\"This shall happen to him,\" he said, \"to him as well as to the other\r\nprisoners ... this!\"\r\n\r\nThen Zbyszko's brow furrowed.\r\n\r\n\"Listen, Skirwoilla,\" he said. \"Nothing will happen to him, neither\r\n_this_ nor _that_ because he is my prisoner and my friend. Prince Janusz\r\nknighted both of us. I will not even permit you to cut off one finger\r\nfrom his hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will not permit?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I will not.\"\r\n\r\nThen they glared fiercely into each other's eyes. Skirwoilla's face was\r\nso much wrinkled that it had the appearance of a bird of prey. It\r\nappeared as if both were about to burst out. But Zbyszko did not want any\r\ntrouble with the old leader, whom he prized and respected; moreover his\r\nheart was greatly agitated with the events of the day. He fell suddenly\r\nupon his neck, pressed him to his breast and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Do you really desire to tear him from me, and with him my last hope? Why\r\ndo you wrong me?\"\r\n\r\nSkirwoilla did not repel the embrace. Finally, withdrawing his head from\r\nZbyszko's arm, he looked at him benignantly, breathing heavily.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he said, after a moment's silence. \"Well, to-morrow I will give\r\norders for the prisoners to be hanged, but if you want any one of them, I\r\nwill give him to you.\"\r\n\r\nThen they embraced each other again and parted on good terms--to the\r\ngreat satisfaction of Macko, who said:\r\n\r\n\"It is obvious that you will never be able to do anything with him by\r\nanger, but with kindness you can knead him like wax.\"\r\n\r\n\"Such is the whole nation,\" replied Zbyszko; \"but the Germans do not know\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nThen he gave orders for de Lorche, who had taken rest in the booth, to be\r\nbrought to the camp-fire. A moment later the Bohemian brought him in; he\r\nwas unarmed and without a helmet, having only his leather jacket upon\r\nwhich the marks of the coat of mail were visible. He had a red cap on his\r\nhead. De Lorche had already been informed by Hlawa that he was a prisoner\r\nand therefore he came in looking cool and haughty, and the light of the\r\nflames revealed defiance and contempt in his countenance.\r\n\r\n\"Thank God,\" Zbyszko said, \"that He delivered you in my hands, because\r\nnothing evil shall happen to you by me.\"\r\n\r\nThen he extended a friendly hand; but de Lorche did not even move.\r\n\r\n\"I decline to give my hand to knights who outrage knightly honor, by\r\njoining pagans in fighting Christian knights.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the Mazovians present, who could not restrain himself, owing to\r\nZbyszko's importance, on hearing this became excited and his blood\r\nboiled.\r\n\r\n\"Fool!\" he shouted and involuntarily grasped the handle of his\r\n\"_misericordia_.\"\r\n\r\nBut de Lorche lifted up his head.\r\n\r\n\"Kill me,\" he said. \"I know that you do not spare prisoners.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, do you spare prisoners?\" the Mazur who could not restrain himself,\r\nexclaimed: \"Did you not hang on the shore of the island all the prisoners\r\nyou took in the last fight? That is the reason why Skirwoilla will hang\r\nall his prisoners.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes! they did hang them, but they were pagans.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a certain sense of shame in his reply; it could easily be seen\r\nthat he did not entirely approve of such deeds.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Zbyszko controlled himself, and in a quiet and dignified\r\nmanner said:\r\n\r\n\"De Lorche, you and I received our belts and spurs from the same hand,\r\nyou also know well that knightly honor is dearer to me than life and\r\nfortune. Listen, therefore, to my words which I say under oath to Saint\r\nJerzy: There are many among this people whose Christianity does not date\r\nfrom yesterday, and those who have not yet been converted stretch out\r\ntheir hands toward the Cross for salvation. But, do you know who hinder\r\nthem and prevent their salvation and baptism?\"\r\n\r\nThe Mazur translated all Zbyszko's words to de Lorche, who looked into\r\nthe young knight's face questioningly.\r\n\r\n\"The Germans!\" said Zbyszko.\r\n\r\n\"Impossible,\" shouted de Lorche.\r\n\r\n\"By the spear and spurs of Saint Jerzy, the Germans! Because if the\r\nreligion of the Cross were to be propagated here, they would lose a\r\npretext for incursions, and domination and oppression of this unhappy\r\npeople. You are well acquainted with these facts, de Lorche! You are best\r\ninformed whether their dealings are upright or not.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I think that in fighting with the pagans they are only banishing\r\nthem to prepare them for baptism.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are baptizing them with the sword and blood, not with water that\r\nsaves. Read this letter, I pray, and you will be convinced that you\r\nyourself are the wrongdoer, plunderer and the hell-_starosta_ of those\r\nwho fight religion and Christian love.\"\r\n\r\nThen he handed him the letter which the Zmudzians had written to the\r\nkings and princes, which was distributed everywhere; de Lorche took it\r\nand perused it rapidly by the light of the fire. He was greatly\r\nsurprised, and said;\r\n\r\n\"Can all that be true?\"\r\n\r\n\"May God, who sees best, so help you and me that I am not only speaking\r\nthe truth but I also serve justice.\"\r\n\r\nDe Lorche was silent for a moment and then said:\r\n\r\n\"I am your prisoner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give me your hand,\" replied Zbyszko. \"You are my brother, not my\r\nprisoner.\"\r\n\r\nThen they clasped hands and sat down in company to supper, which the\r\nBohemian ordered the servant to prepare.\r\n\r\nDe Lorche was greatly surprised when he was informed on the road that\r\nZbyszko, in spite of his letters, had not got Danusia, and that the\r\n_comthurs_ had refused important and safe conduct on account of the\r\noutbreak of the war.\r\n\r\n\"Now I understand why you are here,\" he said to Zbyszko, \"and I thank God\r\nthat He delivered me into your hands, because I think that through me the\r\nKnights of the Order will surrender to you what you wish. Otherwise there\r\nwill be a great outcry in the West, because I am a knight of importance\r\nand come from a powerful family....\"\r\n\r\nThen he suddenly threw down his cap and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"By all the relics of Akwizgran! Then those who were at the head of the\r\nrelief train to Gotteswerder, were Arnold von Baden and old Zygfried von\r\nLöve. That we learned from the letters which were sent to the castle.\r\nWere they taken prisoners?\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" said Zbyszko, excitedly. \"None of the most important! But, by God!\r\nThe news you tell me is important. For God's sake, tell me, are there\r\nother prisoners from whom I can learn whether there were any women with\r\nZygfried?\"\r\n\r\nThen he called the men to bring him lit resinous chips and he hastened to\r\nwhere the prisoners were gathered by order of Skirwoilla. De Lorche,\r\nMacko and the Bohemian ran with him.\r\n\r\n\"Listen,\" said de Lorche to Zbyszko, on the way. \"If you will let me free\r\non parole I will run and seek her throughout the whole of Prussia, and\r\nwhen I find her, I will return to you and you will exchange me for her.\"\r\n\r\n\"If she lives! If she lives!\" replied Zbyszko.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile they reached the place where Skirwoilla's prisoners were. Some\r\nwere lying upon their backs, others stood near the stumps of trees to\r\nwhich they were cruelly fastened with fibre. The bright flame of the\r\nchips illuminated Zbyszko's face. Therefore all the prisoners' looks were\r\ndirected toward him.\r\n\r\nThen from the depths of the road there was heard a loud and terrible\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n\"My lord and protector! Oh, save me!\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko snatched from the hands of the servant a couple of burning chips\r\nand ran into the forest toward the direction whence the voice proceeded,\r\nholding aloft the burning chips, and cried:\r\n\r\n\"Sanderus!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sanderus!\" repeated the Bohemian, in astonishment.\r\n\r\nBut Sanderus, whose hands were bound to the tree, stretched his neck and\r\nbegan to shout again.\r\n\r\n\"Mercy!... I know where Jurand's daughter is!... Save me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers unbound him at once, but his limbs were benumbed and he\r\nfell; when they lifted him up he was seized with successive fainting\r\nfits. In spite of Zbyszko's orders for him to be taken to the fire and\r\ngiven food and drink, and rubbed over with fat and then covered with\r\nwarmed skins, Sanderus did not recover consciousness, but lapsed into a\r\nvery deep sleep, which continued until noon of the following day when the\r\nBohemian succeeded in awakening him.\r\n\r\nZbyszko, who was burning with fiery impatience, immediately went to him,\r\nbut at first he could get no information from him, because either from\r\nhis terrible experiences or from the relaxation which usually overpowers\r\nweak natures when the threatening danger has passed, Sanderus burst into\r\nlong and uncontrollable weeping, so that for some time he could give no\r\nanswer to the questions put to him. He was choked with sobs, his lips\r\ntrembled, and tears flowed down his cheeks so copiously that it seemed as\r\nthough his very life was flowing out with them.\r\n\r\nFinally he succeeded to some extent in controlling himself, and he\r\nstrengthened himself a little with mares' milk, which mode of refreshing\r\nthemselves the Lithunians learned from the Tartars. He began to complain\r\nthat the \"sons of Belial\" had thrust him with their pikes against a wild\r\napple-tree; that they had taken away his horse which was laden with\r\nrelics of priceless virtue; and finally when they had bound him to the\r\ntree, the ants had attacked his feet and body so that he expected to die\r\nfrom it, if not to-day, to-morrow.\r\n\r\nZbyszko's anger overcame him and he could restrain himself no longer, and\r\nhe interrupted Sanderus and said:\r\n\r\n\"You vagabond, answer the questions I am going to put to you and take\r\ncare that you tell the truth, or you will fare worse.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are red ants yonder,\" said the Bohemian, \"order them to be pat\r\nupon him, and he will soon find a tongue in his mouth.\"\r\n\r\nHlawa did not say this seriously; he even smiled as he spoke, for his\r\nheart was well inclined toward Sanderus. The latter, however, was\r\nterror-stricken, and shouted.\r\n\r\n\"Mercy! Mercy! Give me some more of that pagan drink and I will tell you\r\nall that I have and that I have not seen.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you tell lies, even one word that is not true, I will drive a wedge\r\nbetween your teeth,\" said the Bohemian.\r\n\r\nThey brought him another skin full of mares' milk; he grasped it and\r\nfastened his lips to it with the avidity that a child does to its\r\nmother's breast, and began to gulp it down, alternatively opening and\r\nclosing his eyes. When he had drank from it about half a gallon or more,\r\nhe shook himself, placed the skin upon his knees, and as if submitting\r\nhimself to the inevitable, he said:\r\n\r\n\"Vile stuff!...\" Then he turned toward Zbyszko. \"Now, deliverer! ask.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was my wife in that division with you?\"\r\n\r\nSanderus' face assumed a certain air of surprise. In fact he had heard\r\nthat Danusia was Zbyszko's wife, but it had been a secret marriage, and\r\nimmediately afterward she had been abducted, and he had always thought of\r\nher as Jurandowna, (Miss Jurand).\r\n\r\nHe replied quickly:\r\n\r\n\"Yes, _voyevode!_ She was! But Zygfried von Löve and Arnold von Baden\r\nbroke through the enemy's ranks and escaped.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you see her?\" asked Zbyszko, with beating heart.\r\n\r\n\"I did not see her face, sir, but I saw a closed litter made of\r\nbrushwood, suspended between two horses, in which there was somebody, led\r\nby that very lizard, the same servant of the Order who came from Danveld\r\nto the Forest Court. I also heard sad singing proceeding from the\r\nlitter....\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko grew pale with emotion; he sat down on the stump and was unable\r\nto ask another question for a while. Macko and the Bohemian were also\r\nmuch moved at this great and important news. The latter, probably,\r\nthought about his beloved lady who remained at Spychow, and upon whom\r\nthis news would fall like a doom.\r\n\r\nThere was silence for a moment. Finally, the shrewd Macko who did not\r\nknow Sanderus, and who had scarcely heard of him previously, looked at\r\nhim with suspicion, and asked:\r\n\r\n\"Who are you and what were you doing among the Knights of the Cross?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who am I, powerful knight?\" replied Sanderus. \"Let this valiant prince\r\nanswer for me,\" (here he pointed toward Zbyszko), \"and this manly\r\nBohemian noble who has known me long.\"\r\n\r\nThe effect of the kumys (mares' milk) upon Sanderus apparently began to\r\nshow itself, for he grew lively, and turning to Zbyszko he spoke in a\r\nloud voice and showed no trace of his previous feeble condition.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, you have saved my life twice. If it were not for you, the wolves\r\nwould have devoured me, or the punishment of the bishops who were\r\nmisguided by my enemies. (Oh, what a wicked world this is!) They issued\r\nan order to hunt me for selling relics which they thought were not\r\ngenuine, simply because they took me for one of your people. But you, O\r\nlord, protected me, and thanks to you I was not destroyed by the wolves,\r\nnor shall their persecution harm me. Food and drink was never lacking\r\nwhilst I was with you--better than the mares' milk here which makes me\r\nsick, but I drink it in order to show how a poor but pious pilgrim can\r\nstand all kinds of privations.\"\r\n\r\n\"Speak, you bear-trainer; tell us quickly what you know, and do not play\r\nthe fool,\" exclaimed Macko.\r\n\r\nBut he lifted the skin to his mouth again and entirely emptied it;\r\napparently not hearing Macko's words, he turned again to Zbyszko: \"This\r\nis another reason why I love you. The saints, as it is written in the\r\nScriptures, sinned nine times an hour, consequently, sometimes also\r\nSanderus transgresses, but Sanderus never was nor shall be ungrateful.\r\nTherefore, when misfortune came upon you, you remember, sir, what I told\r\nyou; I said, 'I will go from castle to castle, and, instructing the\r\npeople along the road, I will search for your lost one.' Whom did I not\r\nask? Where did I not go?--It would take me a long time to tell you.--But,\r\nsuffice it to say, I found her; and from that moment on, burrs do not\r\ncling as tenaciously to the cloak as I attached myself to old Zygfried. I\r\nbecame his servant, and from castle to castle, from one _comthur_ to\r\nanother, from town to town I went with him without intermission until\r\nthis last battle.\"\r\n\r\nZybszko meanwhile mastered his emotion and said:\r\n\r\n\"I am very thankful to you and I shall surely reward you. But now, answer\r\nmy questions. Will you swear, by the salvation of your soul, that she is\r\nalive?\"\r\n\r\n\"I swear by the salvation of my soul that she is alive,\" replied\r\nSanderus, with a serious air.\r\n\r\n\"Why did Zygfried leave Szczytno?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know, sir. But I surmise that as he was never the _starosta_ of\r\nSzczytno, he left it; perhaps he feared the grand master's orders, which\r\nwere, they say, to give up the little lamb to the Mazovian court. Perhaps\r\nthat very letter was the cause of his flight, because his soul burned\r\nwithin him with pain and vengeance for Rotgier who, they say now, was\r\nZygfried's own son. I cannot tell what happened there, but this I do\r\nknow, that something turned his head and he raved, and determined not to\r\nsurrender Jurand's daughter--I meant to say, the young lady--as long as\r\nhe lives.\"\r\n\r\n\"All this seems to me very strange,\" suddenly interrupted Macko. \"If that\r\nold dog thirsts so much for the blood of all who belong to Jurand, he\r\nwould have killed Danuska.\"\r\n\r\n\"He wanted to do so,\" replied Sanderus, \"but something happened to him\r\nand he became very sick, and was at the point of death. His people\r\nwhisper much over that affair. Some say that upon a certain night when he\r\nwent to the tower intending to kill the young lady he met the Evil\r\nSpirit--some say it was an angel whom he met--well--they found him lying\r\nupon the snow in front of the tower wholly lifeless. Now, when he thinks\r\nabout it, his hair stands up upon his head like oak-trees; this is the\r\nreason why he does not himself dare to lift up his hand against her, he\r\neven fears to order others to do it. He has with him the dumb executioner\r\nof Szczytno, but it is not known why, because the executioner as well as\r\nothers, are equally afraid to harm her.\"\r\n\r\nThese words made a great impression. Zbyszko, Macko and the Bohemian came\r\nnear Sanderus, who crossed himself and then continued:\r\n\r\n\"It was not well to be among them. More than once I heard and saw things\r\nthat made my flesh creep. I have told your lordship already that\r\nsomething was wrong with the old _comthur's_ head. Bah! How could it be\r\notherwise, when spirits from the other world visit him. He would have\r\nremained there, but some presence is always near him which sounds like\r\none who is breathless. And that is that very Danveld, whom the terrible\r\nlord of Spychow killed. Then Zygfried says to him: 'What shall I do? I\r\ncannot avenge you on anything; what profit will you get?' But the other\r\n(the ghost) gnashes his teeth and then pants again. Very often Rotgier\r\nappears, and the odor of sulphur is noticeable, and the _comthur_ has a\r\nlengthy conversation with him. 'I cannot,' he says to him. 'I cannot.\r\nWhen I come myself then I will do it, but now I cannot.' I also heard the\r\nold man asking: 'Will that comfort you, dear son,' and other expressions\r\nof the same character. When this happens, the old _comthur_ speaks to\r\nnobody for two or three days in succession, and his face seems as if he\r\nis suffering intense pain. He and the woman servant of the Order watch\r\nthe litter carefully, so that the young lady is always unable to see\r\nanybody.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do they not torture her?\" asked Zbyszko, in hollow tones.\r\n\r\n\"I will tell your lordship the candid truth, that I did not hear any\r\nbeating or crying; the only thing I heard proceeding from the litter was\r\nsad melodies; sometimes it seemed to me like sweet, sad warblings of a\r\nbird....\"\r\n\r\n\"That is terrible,\" exclaimed Zbyszko, his voice hissing between his set\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\nBut Macko interrupted further questioning.\r\n\r\n\"That is enough,\" he said. \"Speak now of the battle. Did you see how they\r\ndeparted and what became of them?\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw and will give a faithful account. At first they fought terribly.\r\nBut when they saw that they were surrounded on all sides, then only they\r\nthought of escape. Sir Arnold, who is quite a giant, was the first to\r\nbreak the ring, and opened such a road, that he, the old _comthur_ and\r\nsome people with the horse-litter succeeded in passing through it.\"\r\n\r\n\"How is it that they were not pursued?\"\r\n\r\n\"They were pursued, but nothing could be done, because when they came too\r\nnear them, then Sir Arnold faced the pursuers and fought them all. God\r\nprotect those who meet him, because he possesses such extraordinary\r\nstrength; he considers it a trifle to fight against a hundred. Thrice he\r\nthus turned, thrice he kept the pursuers in check. All the people who\r\nwere with him perished. It seems to me that he too was wounded, and so\r\nwas his horse, but he escaped, and meanwhile the old _comthur_ succeeded\r\nin making good his escape.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Macko heard the story he thought that Sanderus was telling the\r\ntruth, for he recollected that when he entered the field where Skirwoilla\r\nhad given battle, the whole stretch of the road on the line of the\r\nGermans' retreat, was covered with dead Zmudzians, so terribly hacked as\r\nthough it had been done by giant hands.\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless, how could you observe all that?\" he asked Sanderus.\r\n\r\n\"I saw it,\" replied the vagabond, \"because I grasped the tail of one of\r\nthe horses which carried the litter, and held on until I received a kick\r\nin my stomach. Then I fainted, and that was the reason that you captured\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\"That might happen,\" said Hlawa, \"but take care, if anything you say\r\nturns out to be false; in such case you shall fare badly.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is another proof,\" replied Sanderus; \"let one who wishes take a\r\nnote of it; yet it is better to believe a man's word than to condemn him\r\nas one who does not tell the truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Although you sometimes unwillingly tell the truth, you will howl for\r\nsimony.\"\r\n\r\nAnd they began to tease each other as they formerly did, but Zbyszko\r\ninterrupted their chatter.\r\n\r\n\"You have passed through that region, then you must be acquainted with\r\nthe localities in the neighborhood of the castles; where do you suppose\r\nZygfried and Arnold hide themselves?\"\r\n\r\n\"There are no strongholds whatever in that neighborhood; all is one\r\nwilderness, through which a road was recently cut. There are neither\r\nvillages nor farms. The Germans burned those that were there, for the\r\nreason that the inhabitants of those places who are also Zmudzians, had\r\nalso risen in arms against the Knights of the Cross with their brethren\r\nhere. I think, sir, that Zygfried and Arnold are now wandering about the\r\nwoods; either they are trying to return to the place whence they came, or\r\nattempting furtively to reach that fortress whither we were going to\r\nbefore that unfortunate battle.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure that it is so,\" said Zbyszko. He became absorbed in thought so\r\nthat he contracted his brows; he was obviously trying to find some plan,\r\nbut it did not last long. After a while he lifted up his head and said:\r\n\r\n\"Hlawa! See that the horses and men get ready; we must move at once.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bohemian, whose custom was never to ask for reasons when commanded,\r\nwithout saying a single word, got up and ran toward the horses; then\r\nMacko opened wide his eyes at his nephew and said with surprise:\r\n\r\n\"And ... Zbyszko? Hey! Where are you going? What?... How?...\"\r\n\r\nBut he answered his questions with another:\r\n\r\n\"And what do you think? Is it not my duty?\"\r\n\r\nThe old knight had nothing to say. His looks of astonishment disappeared\r\nlittle by little from his face; he shook his head once or twice and\r\nfinally drew a deep breath and said as though replying to himself:\r\n\r\n\"Well! there you are.... There is no other remedy!\"\r\n\r\nAnd he also went to the horses, but Zbyszko returned to de Lorche, and by\r\nmeans of a Mazovian interpreter spoke to him thus:\r\n\r\n\"I cannot ask you to go with me against the people with whom you served.\r\nYou are therefore free and you may go wherever you please.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot serve you now with my sword against my knightly honor,\" replied\r\nde Lorche; \"but as to your granting me my freedom, I cannot accept that\r\neither. I remain your prisoner on parole and shall be at your command\r\nwhithersoever you send me. And in case you want to exchange prisoners,\r\nremember that the Order will exchange for me any prisoner, because I am\r\nnot only a powerful knight, but I am a descendant of a line of Knights of\r\nthe Cross of great merit.\"\r\n\r\nThen they embraced each other according to custom, placing their hands on\r\neach other's arms and kissing each other on the cheeks, and de Lorche\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"I will go to Malborg or to the Mazovian court, so that you may know if I\r\nam not in one place you can find me in the other. Thy messenger need only\r\ntell me the two words, '_Lotaryngia-Geldria_'\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Zbyszko, \"still I will go to Skirwoilla to obtain a pass for\r\nyou which the Zmudzians will respect.\"\r\n\r\nThen he called upon Skirwoilla; the old leader gave the pass for his\r\ndeparture without any difficulty, for he knew all about the affair and\r\nloved Zbyszko; he was grateful to him for his bravery in the last battle,\r\nand for this very reason he made no objection whatever to the departure\r\nof the knight who belonged to another country and came on his own\r\naccount. Then, thanking Zbyszko for the great services which he had\r\nrendered, he looked at him in surprise at his courage in undertaking a\r\njourney in the wild lands; he bid him good-bye, expressing his wishes to\r\nmeet him again in some greater and more conclusive affair against the\r\nKnights of the Cross.\r\n\r\nBut Zbyszko was in a great hurry, for he was consumed as with a fever.\r\nWhen he arrived at the post he found everybody ready, and his uncle,\r\nMacko, on horseback, among them; he was armed and had on his coat of mail\r\nand his helmet upon his head. Zbyszko approached him and said:\r\n\r\n\"Then you too go with me!\"\r\n\r\n\"But what else could I do?\" replied Macko, a little testily.\r\n\r\nZbyszko did not reply, but kissed the right hand of his uncle, then\r\nmounted his horse and proceeded.\r\n\r\nSanderus went with them. They knew the road as far as the battlefield\r\nvery well, but beyond that he was to guide them. They also counted upon\r\nthe local inhabitants whom they might meet in the woods; who, out of\r\nhatred of their masters, the Knights of the Cross, would aid them in\r\ntracking the old _comthur_ and the knight, Arnold von Baden, to whom\r\nSanderus attributed such superhuman strength and bravery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nThe road to the battlefield where Skirwoilla had routed the Germans was\r\neasy, because they knew it, and so they soon reached it. Owing to the\r\ninsufferable stench arising from the unburied dead, they crossed it in a\r\nhurry. As they did so, they drove away wolves, and large flights of\r\ncrows, ravens and jackdaws. Then they began to look for traces along the\r\nroad. Although a whole division had passed over it on the previous day,\r\nnevertheless, the experienced Macko found upon the trampled road without\r\ntrouble, the imprint of gigantic hoofs leading in an opposite direction.\r\nThen he explained to the younger and less experienced companions-in-arms:\r\n\r\n\"It is fortunate that there has been no rainfall since the battle. Only\r\nlook here. Arnold's horse carrying an unusually big man must also be\r\nexceedingly large; this too is easily observed, that the imprint of the\r\nhorse's feet on this side of the road is much deeper, owing to the\r\ngalloping in his flight; whilst the tracks marking the previous march on\r\nthe other side of the road are not so deep, because the horse walked\r\nslowly. Let those who have eyes look how the marks of the horseshoes are\r\nvisible. God grant that we may track those dog-brothers successfully,\r\nprovided they have not already found shelter somewhere behind walls!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sanderus said,\" replied Zbyszko, \"that there are no forts in this\r\nneighborhood, and it is actually so; because the Knights of the Cross\r\nhave only recently taken possession of this region and have not had\r\nenough time to build in it. Then where can they hide themselves? All the\r\npeasants who dwelt in these lands joined Skirwoilla, because they belong\r\nto the same stock as the Zmudzians.... The villages, Sanderus said, these\r\nsame Germans destroyed by fire and the women and children are hidden in\r\nthe thick forest. Provided we do not spare our horses we shall yet\r\novertake them.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must spare the horses, for even if we overtake them our safety\r\nafterward depends upon our horses,\" said Macko.\r\n\r\n\"Sir Arnold,\" interrupted Sanderus, \"received a blow between his\r\nshoulder-blades in battle. He took no notice of it at first, but kept on\r\nfighting and slaying, but they were obliged to dress it afterward; as is\r\nalways the case, at first one does not feel the blows but they pain later\r\non. For this reason he cannot exert himself too much to run fast and it\r\nmay be that he is even obliged to rest himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"You said that there are no other people with them?\" inquired Macko.\r\n\r\n\"There are two who lead the litter, the _comthur_ and Sir Arnold. There\r\nwere quite a number of men with them, but the Zmudzians killed them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let our men lay hold of the two fellows who are with the litter,\" said\r\nZbyszko. \"You, uncle, manage old Zygfried, and I will pounce upon\r\nArnold.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" replied Macko, \"I shall be able to manage Zygfried, because,\r\nthank God, there is still strength in these bones. But as far as your\r\ntask is concerned, I should say, do not be so self-confident, for that\r\nknight seems to be a giant.\"\r\n\r\n\"O well! We shall see,\" replied Zbyszko.\r\n\r\n\"You are strong, that I don't dispute, but there are stronger men than\r\nyou are. Did you observe our own knights whom we met at Krakow? Could you\r\nconquer Pan Powala of Taczew, Paszko Zlodziej of Biskupice, and Zawisza\r\nCzarny, eh? Don't be too rash, but consider the facts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rotgier also was a strong man,\" murmured Zbyszko.\r\n\r\n\"Will there be any work for myself?\" asked the Bohemian. But he received\r\nno reply, because Macko was thinking about something else.\r\n\r\n\"If God blesses us we shall be able to reach the Mazowiecki wilderness.\r\nWe shall be safe there, and all trouble will be at an end.\"\r\n\r\nBut after a while he sighed when he reflected that even there affairs\r\nwould not be entirely ended, there would yet be something to attend to\r\nfor the unfortunate Jagienka.\r\n\r\n\"Hey!\" he murmured, \"God's decrees are wonderful. I had often thought\r\nabout it. Why did it not occur to you to get married quietly, and let me\r\nlive with you peacefully. That would have been the most happy course. But\r\nnow we are the only ones among the noblemen of the kingdom, who are\r\nwandering in various regions and wilds, instead of attending to our homes\r\nas God commands.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that is true, but it is God's will,\" replied Zbyszko.\r\n\r\nThen they proceeded on their journey for a while in silence. The old\r\nknight turned again to his nephew:\r\n\r\n\"Do you rely on that vagabond? Who is he?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is a fickle man and perhaps he is a rogue, but he wishes me well, and\r\nI am not afraid of treachery from him.\"\r\n\r\n\"If so let him ride in front, for if he overtakes them he will not be\r\nscared. Let him tell them that he is fleeing from captivity, and they\r\nwill easily believe him. This is the best way, because if they chanced to\r\nsee us they might evade us and hide themselves, or have time enough to\r\nprepare for defence.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is afraid and will not travel by himself at night,\" replied Zbyszko.\r\n\"But during the daytime I am sure that that plan is the best one to\r\nadopt. I will tell him to stop and wait for us three times during the\r\nday. If we do not find him at the appointed places then it will be a sign\r\nthat he is already with them, and following up his tracks we will fall\r\nupon them unexpectedly.\"\r\n\r\n\"But will he not warn them?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. He is more friendly to me than to them. I will also tell him that\r\nwhen we surprise them we will also bind him, so that he may escape their\r\nrevenge later on. Let him not recognize us at all....\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you intend to preserve those fellows alive?\"\r\n\r\n\"How else should it be?\" replied Zbyszko, somewhat anxiously. \"You\r\nsee.... If it were in our country, at home in Mazowsze, we would\r\nchallenge them, as I challenged Rotgier, to mortal combat; but this\r\ncannot be here in their own country.... What concerns us here is Danuska\r\nand speed. In order to avoid trouble all must be done quietly afterward\r\nwe will do as you said and push on as fast as our horses can go, to the\r\nwilds of Mazowsze. But attacking them unexpectedly we might find them\r\nunarmed, yes, even without their swords. Then how could we kill them? I\r\nam afraid of reproach. We are now both of us, belted knights, so are\r\nthey....\"\r\n\r\n\"It is so,\" said Macko. \"Yet it may lead to an encounter.\"\r\n\r\nBut Zbyszko contracted his brow and in his face was depicted that\r\ndetermination so characteristic of the looks of the men of Bogdaniec, for\r\nat that moment he looked as if he were Macko's own son.\r\n\r\n\"What I should also like,\" he said, in low tones, \"is to have that bloody\r\ndog Zygfried crushed under Jurand's feet! May God grant it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Grant it, God! grant it!\" immediately repeated Macko.\r\n\r\nWhilst conversing, they covered a considerable stretch of the road until\r\nnightfall. It was a starry night, but there was no moon. They were\r\nobliged to halt the horses, breathe, and refresh the men with food and\r\nsleep. Zbyszko informed Sanderus before resting that he was to proceed in\r\nfront in the morning. Sanderus willingly assented; but reserved to\r\nhimself, in case of an attack by wolves or people, the right to run back\r\nto Zbyszko. He also asked him for permission to make four stations\r\ninstead of three, because in solitude fear always took hold of him, even\r\nin pious countries. How much more so in such an abominable wilderness as\r\nthe one where they found themselves now?\r\n\r\nWhen they had refreshed themselves with food, they lay down to sleep upon\r\nskins near a small camp-fire, which they built about half a furlong from\r\nthe road. The servants alternately guarded the horses, which, after they\r\nwere fed, rolled upon the ground and then slept, resting their heads upon\r\neach other's necks. But no sooner did the first ray illuminate the woods\r\nwith a silvery hue, than Zbyszko arose and awoke the others, and at dawn\r\nthey continued their march. The tracks of the hoofs of Arnold's immense\r\nstallion were easily recovered, because the usual muddy ground had dried\r\nup from drought. Sanderus went on ahead and soon disappeared.\r\nNevertheless, they found him about half way between sunrise and noon, at\r\nthe waiting place. He told them that he had not seen any living soul,\r\nonly one large aurochs, but was not scared and did not run away, because\r\nthe animal got out of his way. But he declared that shortly before, he\r\nhad seen a peasant bee-keeper, but had not detained him, for fear that in\r\nthe depths of the forest there might be more of them. He had attempted to\r\nquestion him, but they had not been able to make themselves understood.\r\n\r\nAs time went by, Zbyszko became somewhat troubled.\r\n\r\n\"What will happen,\" he said, \"if I arrive in the higher and drier region,\r\nwhere, owing to the hard, dry road, the traces of the fugitives will be\r\nlost? or, if the pursuit shall last too long and lead to an inhabited\r\nregion where the people have long since accustomed themselves to the\r\nservitude of the Knights of the Cross; an attack and capture of Danusia\r\nby them is more than probable, because, although Arnold and Zygfried did\r\nnot erect forts, or fortify their towns, the inhabitants would surely\r\ntake their part.\"\r\n\r\nHappily that fear turned out to be groundless, because they did not find\r\nSanderus at the appointed second post, but found instead an incision in\r\nthe form of a cross, apparently newly cut into the bark of an adjacent\r\npine tree. They looked at each other and their hearts began to beat\r\nfaster. Macko and Zbyszko immediately dismounted, in order to discover\r\nthe tracks upon the ground; they examined carefully, but it did not last\r\nlong, because they were plainly discernible.\r\n\r\nSanderus had apparently deviated from the road into the forest, and\r\nfollowed the prints of the huge horse-hoofs, which, owing to the dry\r\ncondition of the turfy soil, were not so deeply impressed, but\r\nsufficiently visible. The heavy horse disturbed at every step the pine\r\nneedles which were blackened at the margins of the impressions.\r\n\r\nOther marks did not escape Zbyszko's keen sight. Then he and Macko\r\nmounted their horses, and, together with the Bohemian, silently began\r\ntaking counsel as though the enemy were quite near them.\r\n\r\nThe Bohemian's advice was that they should advance on foot at once, but\r\nthey did not agree to that, because they did not know the distance they\r\nwould have to traverse in the woods. The footmen, however, had to proceed\r\ncarefully in advance, and signal in case something occurred, so that they\r\nmight be in readiness.\r\n\r\nThey moved onward among the woods in some trepidation, and another\r\nincision upon a pine tree assured them that they had not lost Sanderus'\r\ntracks. Very soon they also discovered a path, showing that people\r\nfrequently passed that way, and they were convinced that they were in the\r\nneighborhood of some forest habitation, and within it was the object of\r\ntheir search.\r\n\r\nThe sun was getting low, and shed a golden hue upon the trees of the\r\nforest. The evening promised to be serene; silence reigned in the woods\r\nbecause beast and birds had retired to rest, only here and there, among\r\nthe little top branches of the trees, squirrels moved to and fro looking\r\nquite red in the last beams of the sun. Zbyszko, Macko, the Bohemian and\r\nthe attendants, closely followed each other, knowing that their men were\r\nconsiderably in advance and would warn them in proper time; the old\r\nknight spoke to his nephew in not very subdued tones.\r\n\r\n\"Let us calculate from the sun,\" he said. \"From the last station to the\r\nplace where we found the first incision, we covered a great distance.\r\nAccording to Krakow time it would be about three hours.... Then Sanderus\r\nmust be by this time among them, and has had time enough to tell them his\r\nadventure, provided he has not betrayed us.\"\r\n\r\n\"He has not betrayed us,\" replied Zbyszko.\r\n\r\n\"Provided they believe him,\" continued Macko; \"if they do not, then it\r\nwill be bad for him.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why should they not believe him? Do they know of us? Him they know.\r\nIt often happens that prisoners escape from captivity.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what concerns me is this: if he told them that he ran away they\r\nmight fear he would be pursued, and they would move on at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, he will succeed in casting dust in their eyes by telling them that\r\nsuch a long pursuit would not be undertaken.\"\r\n\r\nThey were silent for a while, then it seemed to Macko that Zbyszko was\r\nwhispering to him; he turned and asked:\r\n\r\n\"What do you say?\"\r\n\r\nBut Zbyszko had said nothing to Macko, but looking upward, said:\r\n\r\n\"Only if God would favor Danuska and the courageous enterprise in her\r\nbehalf.\"\r\n\r\nMacko also began to cross himself; but he had scarcely made the first\r\nsign of the cross, when from the hazelnut thickets one of the scouts\r\napproached him suddenly and said:\r\n\r\n\"A pitch-burning cabin! They are there!\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop!\" whispered Zbyszko, and dismounted at once. Macko, the Bohemian,\r\nand the attendants, also dismounted; three of the latter received orders\r\nto hold the horses in readiness and take care that they, God forbid, did\r\nnot neigh. \"I left five men,\" said Macko. \"There will be the two\r\nattendants and Sanderus, whom we shall bind in a moment, and, should any\r\none show fight, then, at his head!\"\r\n\r\nThen they advanced, and, as they moved on, Zbyszko said to his uncle:\r\n\r\n\"You take the old man, Zygfried; and I, Arnold.\"\r\n\r\n\"Only take care!\" replied Macko. Then he beckoned to the Bohemian,\r\nreminding him to be ready at a moment's notice to be on hand to assist\r\nhis master.\r\n\r\nThe Bohemian nodded assent. Then he breathed deeply and felt for his\r\nsword to see whether it could be easily unsheathed.\r\n\r\nBut Zbyszko observed it and said:\r\n\r\n\"No! I command you to hasten at once to the litter and not move from it\r\nfor a single moment whilst the fight is going on.\"\r\n\r\nThey went quickly but silently through the hazelnut thickets. But they\r\nhad not gone far, when at a distance of not quite two furlongs, the\r\ngrowth ceased suddenly, revealing a small field upon which were\r\nextinguished pitch-burning heaps, and two earthen shanties, or huts,\r\nwhere the pitch-burners had dwelt before the war. The setting sun\r\nbrightly illuminated the lawn, the pitch-burning heaps, and the two\r\ndetached shanties--in front of one of which the two knights were sitting\r\nupon the ground; and in front of the other were Sanderus and a bearded,\r\nred-headed fellow. These two were occupied in polishing the coats of mail\r\nwith rags. Besides this, the two swords were lying at Sanderus' feet\r\nready to be cleaned afterward.\r\n\r\n\"Look,\" said Macko, forcibly grasping Zbyszko's arm to detain him if\r\npossible for another moment, \"he has taken the coats of mail and swords\r\npurposely. Well, that one with the grey head must be....\"\r\n\r\n\"Forward!\" suddenly shouted Zbyszko.\r\n\r\nAnd like a whirlwind he rushed into the clearing; the others did the\r\nsame, but they only succeeded in reaching Sanderus. The terrible Macko\r\ncaught hold of old Zygfried by the breast, bent him backward and in a\r\nmoment held him under him. Zbyszko and Arnold grasped each other like two\r\nhawks, with their arms intertwined and began to struggle fiercely with\r\neach other. The bearded German, who was with Sanderus, sprang toward the\r\nsword, but he did not use it. Wit, Macko's servant, struck him with the\r\nback of his axe, and stretched him upon the ground. Then they began to\r\nbind Sanderus, according to Macko's order, but he, although he well knew\r\nthat it was so arranged beforehand, began to bellow as terribly as a\r\nyearling calf whose throat is being cut by the butcher's knife.\r\n\r\nBut Zbyszko, though so strong that he could squeeze a branch of a tree\r\nand cause the sap to run out, felt that he was not grasped by human\r\nhands, but was in the hug of a bear. He also felt that if it were not for\r\nthe cost of mail which he had on, in case of having to fight with the\r\nsword, the German giant would have crushed his ribs and perhaps the\r\nspinal column too. The young knight lifted him a little from the ground,\r\nbut Arnold lifted him up higher still, and gathering all his strength he\r\ntried to throw him to the ground so that he might not be able to rise\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nBut Zbyszko also clutched him with such terrible force that blood issued\r\nfrom the German's eyes. Then he crooked his leg between Arnold's knees,\r\nbent him sideways and struck him in the hollow of the knee, which threw\r\nhim to the ground. In reality both fell to the ground, the young knight\r\nunderneath; but at the same moment, Macko, who was observing all this,\r\nthrew the half doubled-up Zygfried into the hands of an attendant, and\r\nrushed toward the prostrate fighters, and in the twinkling of an eye he\r\nhad bound the feet of Arnold with a belt; then he jumped, and sat down\r\nupon him as upon a wild boar, took the _misericordia_ from his side, and\r\nplunged it deep into his throat.\r\n\r\nArnold screamed horribly, and his hands involuntarily withdrew from\r\nZbyszko's sides. Then he began to moan not only with the pain of the\r\nwound, but he also felt an indescribable pain in his back: where he had\r\nreceived a blow from a club in his previous fight with Skirwoilla.\r\n\r\nMacko grasped him with both hands and dragged him off Zbyszko, and\r\nZbyszko got up from the ground and sat down; he tried to stand up but\r\ncould not; he sat thus without being able to rise, for some time. His\r\nface was pale and covered with perspiration. His eyes were bloodshot and\r\nhis lips were blue; and he looked in front of him as though half dazed.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter?\" asked Macko, in alarm.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing, but I am very tired. Help me to get up.\"\r\n\r\nMacko put his hands under Zbyszko's arms and lifted him up at once.\r\n\r\n\"Can you stand?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you feel pain?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing, but I am short of breath.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Bohemian, seeing apparently that the struggle in the farm\r\nyard was all over, appeared in front of the hut, dragging the woman\r\nservant of the Order by the neck. At that sight, Zbyszko forgot his\r\nfatigue, his strength returned to him at once, and he rushed to the hut\r\nas though he had never struggled with the terrible Arnold.\r\n\r\n\"Danuska! Danuska!\" cried Zbyszko; but no answer came.\r\n\r\n\"Danuska! Danuska!\" he repeated; then he remained silent. It was dark\r\nwithin, for that reason he could see nothing at first. But instead, he\r\nheard, proceeding from behind the stones which were heaped up behind the\r\nfireplace, a quick and audible panting, like that of a little animal\r\nhiding.\r\n\r\n\"Danuska! For God's sake. It is I! Zbyszko!\"\r\n\r\nThen he observed in the darkness, her eyes, wide open, terrified and\r\nbewildered.\r\n\r\nHe rushed toward her and pressed her in his arms, but she did not\r\nentirely recognize him, and tore herself away from his embrace, and began\r\nto repeat in a subdued whisper:\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid! I am afraid! I am afraid!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF PART SEVENTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART EIGHTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nNeither loving words nor tender persuasion availed. Danusia recognized\r\nnobody and did not regain consciousness. The only feeling which pervaded\r\nher whole being was fear, a kind of fear shown by captured birds. When\r\nfood was brought to her she refused to eat it in the presence of others.\r\nIn the glances of rejection which she cast upon the food one could detect\r\nhabitual hunger. Left alone, she sprang upon the eatables like a ravenous\r\nlittle wild beast. But when Zbyszko entered she rushed into the corner\r\nand hid herself under a bundle of dry hops. Zbyszko opened his arms in\r\nvain, he stretched out his hands in vain, with tears he begged her, but\r\nunavailingly. She refused to issue from her hiding-place even when the\r\nlight was so arranged that she could recognize the outlines of Zbyszko's\r\nface. It seemed as though she had lost her memory along with her senses.\r\nHe therefore gazed upon her emaciated pale face in which was depicted an\r\nexpression of dismay, her hollow eyes, her tattered dress, and his heart\r\ncried out within him from pain at the thought in whose hands she had been\r\nand how she had been treated. He was finally seized with such a terrible\r\nrage that he grasped his sword and rushed toward Zygfried, and he would\r\nhave certainly killed him, had not Macko grasped him by the arm.\r\n\r\nThen like enemies they struggled with each other. But the young man was\r\nso much fatigued from his previous fight with the gigantic Arnold, that\r\nthe old knight prevailed. Twisting Zbyszko's wrist, he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Are you mad?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me go!\" he begged, gnashing his teeth, \"for my heart bursts within\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let it burst! I will not let you go. It is better to dash your head to\r\npieces than disgrace yourself and the whole family.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, clutching Zbyszko's hand, as with iron tongs, he said threateningly:\r\n\r\n\"See, revenge will not escape you; and you are a belted knight. How then\r\ndare you kill a prisoner in bonds? You cannot help Danusia. What will be\r\nthe result? Nothing but disgrace. You say that kings and princes think it\r\nproper to destroy their prisoners. Bah! That is not the case with us; and\r\nwhat is feasible with them is not so with you. They have a kingdom,\r\ncities, castles. But what have you? Knightly honor. Those who find no\r\nfault with them will spit in your face. Consider, for God's sake!\"\r\n\r\nThere was silence for a moment.\r\n\r\n\"Let me go!\" Zbyszko repeated gloomily. \"I will not kill him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come to the fire, let us consult.\"\r\n\r\nMacko led him by the hand to the fire which the servant stirred up near\r\nthe tar-ovens. There they sat down and Macko reflected for a moment, and\r\nthen said:\r\n\r\n\"You must also remember that you have promised this old dog to Jurand,\r\nwho will avenge his own and his daughter's tortures. He is the one who\r\nwill pay him, and do not you fear! In this you must please Jurand. It is\r\nhis affair and not yours. Jurand may do it, but you must not; he did not\r\ncapture him but will receive him as a present from you; he can even flay\r\nhim alive and none will blame him for it. Do you understand me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand,\" replied Zbyszko. \"You are right.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are evidently coming to your senses again. Should you again be\r\ntempted by the devil, bear this also in your mind, that you have also\r\nchallenged Lichtenstein and other Knights of the Cross, and if you should\r\nkill a defenceless captive and the men should publish your action, no\r\nknight would accept your challenge, and he would be justified. God\r\nforbid! We have enough misfortunes, but spare us shame. Let us rather\r\ntalk about what concerns our present doings and movements.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give your advice,\" said the young man.\r\n\r\n\"My advice is this: that serpent who was with Danusia ought to be killed;\r\nbut it does not become a knight to kill a woman. We shall therefore\r\ndeliver her into the hands of Prince Janusz. She plotted treason whilst\r\nat the forest court of the prince and princess. Let the Mazovian courts\r\njudge her. If they do not crush her upon the wheel for her crimes, then\r\nthey will offend God's justice. As long as we find no other woman to wait\r\nupon Danusia, as long as she is wanted to serve her we must keep her\r\nuntil some other old woman be found; then we will tie her to a horse's\r\ntail. But now we must push on toward the Mazovian wilderness as soon as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n\"It cannot be done at once, it is dark already. By to-morrow, if God\r\nwill, Danusia may come to her senses.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let the horses rest well, and at daybreak we will start.\"\r\n\r\nFurther conversation was interrupted by Arnold von Baden, who was\r\nstretched on his back at a distance, trussed by his own sword; he said\r\nsomething in German. Old Macko got up and went to him, but as he did not\r\nunderstand him he called the Bohemian.\r\n\r\nBut Hlawa could not come at once because he was busy about something\r\nelse. During the conversation, near the fire, he went directly to the\r\nservant of the Order, put his hands around her neck, shook her like a\r\npear-tree, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Listen, you slut! Go into the shanty and prepare the fur bedding for the\r\nyoung lady. But before you do that, dress her in your good apparel,\r\nwhilst you put upon your carcass the tattered rags which you have given\r\nher.... May your mother suffer perdition!\"\r\n\r\nHe was so angry that he could not control himself, and shook her so\r\nsavagely that her eyes bulged out. He would have twisted her neck, but he\r\nthought better of it since she was still of some use; finally he let her\r\ngo, saying:\r\n\r\n\"After that I will hang you to a branch.\"\r\n\r\nShe embraced his knees in terror, but he kicked her. She rushed into the\r\nshanty, threw herself at Danusia's feet and began to scream:\r\n\r\n\"Protect me. Do not permit!\"\r\n\r\nBut Danusia closed her eyes, and uttered her customary suppressed\r\nwhisper: \"I am afraid, I am afraid, I am afraid.\"\r\n\r\nThen she lapsed into perfect silence, because that was the effect\r\nwhenever the woman approached her. She permitted the woman to undress,\r\nwash and dress her in the new clothes. The woman prepared the bedding and\r\nlaid upon it Danusia, who had the appearance of a wooden or wax figure;\r\nafter which she sat down near the fireplace fearing to go out.\r\n\r\nBut the Bohemian entered after awhile. First he turned toward Danusia and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"You are among friends, lady, so in the name of the Father, Son and Holy\r\nGhost, sleep peacefully!\"\r\n\r\nThen he made the sign of the cross. Then not wishing to disturb her he\r\nsaid to the servant in a low voice:\r\n\r\n\"You shall lie bound at the threshold; you must keep quiet and do not\r\nfrighten her; if not, I will break your neck. Get up, and come.\"\r\n\r\nHe led her out and bound her tightly, then he went to Zbyszko.\r\n\r\n\"I have ordered that lizard to dress the lady in her own garments, to\r\nmake her a soft bed, and the lady is asleep; better leave her alone\r\nbecause she is scared. God grant that by to-morrow, after repose, she may\r\nregain her presence of mind. You too must think of refreshment and rest.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall sleep at her threshold,\" replied Zbyszko.\r\n\r\n\"Then I shall withdraw the slut from the threshold and place her near\r\nthat corpse with curled locks. But you must take refreshment now, because\r\nthere is a long road and no little fatigue before you.\"\r\n\r\nThen he went and got some smoked meat and dried turnips which they had\r\nprocured in the Lithuanian camp; but he had scarcely put the meal in\r\nfront of Zbyszko when Macko called him to come to Arnold.\r\n\r\n\"Notice carefully, what this mass wishes, although I know a few German\r\nwords, I am unable to understand him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bring him to the fire, sir, and have your conversation there,\" replied\r\nthe Bohemian.\r\n\r\nThen he unbelted himself and placed the belt under Arnold's arms and\r\nlifted him upon his shoulders; he bent much under the heavy weight of the\r\ngiant, but as the Bohemian was a powerful man, he carried him near the\r\nfireplace and threw him down, as one throws a sack of peas, at the side\r\nof Zbyszko.\r\n\r\n\"Take off the fetters from me,\" said Arnold.\r\n\r\n\"That might be done if you swore on knightly honor, that you would\r\nconsider yourself a prisoner. Nevertheless, I will order the sword to be\r\ntaken from under your knees, the bonds of your hands to be loosened, so\r\nas to enable you to sit with us, but the rope binding your feet shall\r\nremain until we have discussed the affair.\" And he nodded to the\r\nBohemian, who cut the bonds away from Arnold's hands and assisted him to\r\nsit down. Arnold looked haughtily at Macko and Zbyszko and asked:\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you dare to ask? It is not your business. Go and inform\r\nyourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"It concerns me, because to swear upon the honor of a knight can only be\r\ndone to knights.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then look!\"\r\n\r\nAnd Macko opened his cloak and showed his knightly belt upon his loins.\r\n\r\nSeeing that, the Knight of the Cross was greatly amazed, and after awhile\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"How is it? and you prowl in the wilderness for prey and assist the\r\npagans against the Christians?\"\r\n\r\n\"You lie!\" exclaimed Macko.\r\n\r\nThen the conversation began in an unfriendly and arrogant manner, which\r\nseemed like quarreling. But when Macko vehemently shouted that the very\r\nOrder prevented Lithuania from embracing Christianity, and when all\r\nproofs were adduced, Arnold was again amazed and became silent, because\r\nthe truth was so obvious that it was impossible not to see it, or to\r\ndispute it. What specially struck him was Macko's words which he uttered\r\nwhilst making the sign of the cross: \"Who knows whom ye actually serve,\r\nif not all at least some among you.\" It specially struck him because\r\nthere were certain _comthurs_ in the very Order who were suspected of\r\nhaving given themselves over to Satan. Steps were not taken against them\r\nfor fear of public reproach of the whole Order. But Arnold knew it well\r\nbecause these things were whispered among the brethren of the Order and\r\nhappenings of such a character reached his ears. Therefore, Macko's\r\nnarrative which he had heard from Sanderus, concerning the inconceivable\r\nconduct of Zygfried, greatly disturbed the mind of the candid giant.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that very Zygfried, with whom you marched to war,\" he said. \"Does he\r\nserve Christ? Have you never heard how he communicates with evil spirits,\r\nhow he whispers to them, smiles and gnashes his teeth at them?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is true!\" murmured Arnold.\r\n\r\nBut Zbyszko, whose heart was filled with new waves of grief and anger,\r\nsuddenly exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"And you, who speak of knightly honor? Shame upon you, because you help a\r\nhangman, a devilish man. Shame upon you, because you quietly looked upon\r\nthe torture of a defenceless woman, and a knight's daughter. Maybe you\r\nalso outraged her. Shame upon you!\"\r\n\r\nArnold closed his eyes, and making the sign of the cross, said:\r\n\r\n\"In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.... How is\r\nthat?... That fettered girl in whose head dwell twenty-seven devils?\r\nI?...\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, horrible! horrible!\" interrupted Zbyszko, groaning.\r\n\r\nAnd, grasping the handle of his _misericordia_ he again looked savagely\r\ntoward the dark corner where Zygfried lay on his back.\r\n\r\nMacko placed his hand quietly upon Zbyszko's arm, which he pressed with\r\nhis whole strength, so as to bring him back to his senses; whilst he\r\nhimself, turning toward Arnold, said:\r\n\r\n\"That woman is the daughter of Jurand of Spychow, and wife of this young\r\nknight. Do you understand now, why we followed you up, and why we have\r\ncaptured you?\"\r\n\r\n\"For God's sake!\" said Arnold. \"Whence? How? she is insane....\"\r\n\r\n\"Because the Knights of the Cross kidnapped that innocent lamb and\r\nsubjected her to torture.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Zbyszko heard these words: \"Innocent lamb,\" he put his fist to his\r\nmouth, gnashed his teeth, and was not able to restrain his tears.\r\n\r\nArnold sat absorbed in thought; but the Bohemian told him in a few words\r\nof Danveld's treachery, the kidnapping of Danusia, the torture of Jurand,\r\nand the duel with Rotgier. Silence reigned when he concluded. It was only\r\ndisturbed by the rustling of the trees of the forest and the crackling of\r\nthe brands in the fireplace.\r\n\r\nIn that manner they sat for a while. Finally Arnold lifted up his head\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n\"I swear to you not only upon my knightly honor, but also upon the\r\ncrucifix, that I have not seen that woman, that I did not know who she\r\nwas, and that I have not taken the least part in her tortures and never\r\nlaid my hand upon her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then swear also that you will go with us willingly and that you will\r\nmake no attempt to escape, then I will order your bonds to be entirely\r\nunloosed,\" said Macko.\r\n\r\n\"Let it be as you say. I swear! Whither are you going to take me?\"\r\n\r\n\"To Mazovia, to Jurand of Spychow.\"\r\n\r\nThen Macko himself cut the rope from Arnold's feet, and ordered meat and\r\nturnips to be brought. After a while Zbyszko went out and sat upon the\r\nthreshold of the hut to rest, where he no longer found the servant, for\r\nthe hostler boys had carried her off and put her among the horses.\r\nZbyszko lay down upon the fur which Hlawa brought. He resolved to keep\r\nawake and wait until daybreak; peradventure then some happy change might\r\ntake place in Danusia!\r\n\r\nBut the Bohemian returned to the fireplace where he wished to converse\r\nwith the old knight of Bogdaniec about a certain affair and take off the\r\nburden which pressed so heavily upon his heart. He found him also\r\nabsorbed in troubled thought, and not noticing the snoring of Arnold who,\r\nafter having consumed an immense quantity of baked turnips and meat, was\r\nmuch fatigued and slept the sleep of a stone. \"And why do you not take a\r\nrest?\" inquired the Bohemian.\r\n\r\n\"Sleep has fled from my eyelids,\" replied Macko. \"May God grant a good\r\nmorning.\"\r\n\r\nThen he looked at the stars and said:\r\n\r\n\"The Wagoner is already visible in the sky, and I am continually thinking\r\nabout how all these things shall be arranged. And I shall not go to sleep\r\neither because the young lady of Zgorzelice occupies my mind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! that is true. More trouble. But she, at least, is at Spychow.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we brought her to Spychow from Zgorzelice, not knowing why.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was at her own request,\" replied Macko, impatiently, because he knew\r\nin his heart that he was wrong and he hated to talk about it.\r\n\r\n\"Yes! But what now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha! Well? I shall carry her back to her home; then let God's will be\r\ndone!\"\r\n\r\nBut after a moment he added:\r\n\r\n\"Yes! God's will be done, that at least Danuska be restored to health,\r\none might then know what to do. But as it is now, the deuce knows! What\r\nwill it be if she neither recovers nor dies? The Devil knows.\"\r\n\r\nBut the Bohemian was thinking all the time of Jagienka.\r\n\r\n\"Your honor should understand that when I left Spychow and bade her\r\ngood-bye, she told me this: 'If anything should happen, come and inform\r\nme before Zbyszko and Macko arrive. And as they will be obliged to send\r\ninformation by somebody, let them send it by you, then you will take me\r\nto Zgorzelice.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Hey!\" replied Macko. \"Surely, it would be improper for her to stay at\r\nSpychow when Danusia arrives. Surely she ought now to be taken back to\r\nZgorzelice. I pity the little orphan, I sincerely regret it. But God's\r\nwill must be done. But now how shall I arrange the matter? Let me see.\r\nDid you say that she commanded you to come ahead of us with the news, and\r\nthen take her to Zgorzelice?\"\r\n\r\n\"She did. I repeated to you her words exactly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, you may move ahead of us. Old Jurand must also be informed that his\r\ndaughter has been found, but it must be done carefully so that the sudden\r\njoy may not kill him. As I love God, I declare that it is the most\r\npractical thing to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Return! Tell them that we have rescued Danusia, and that we shall bring\r\nher home without delay. Then take that other poor girl to Zgorzelice!\"\r\n\r\nThen the old knight sighed, because he was really sorry for Jagienka,\r\nwhom he had fostered.\r\n\r\nAfter a while he asked again:\r\n\r\n\"I know that you are a valiant and powerful man, but see that you keep\r\nher out of harm's way or accident. Things of that character are often met\r\nwith on the road.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall do my best, even if I lose my head! I shall take with me a few\r\ngood men, whom the lord of Spychow will not grudge, and I shall bring her\r\nsafely even to the end of the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, do not have too much confidence in yourself. Bear also in mind\r\nthat even there, at Zgorzelice, it will be necessary to watch Wilk of\r\nBrzozowa and Cztan of Rogow. But, I confess, in speaking of Wilk and\r\nCztan, I am out of order; for, it was necessary to watch them when there\r\nwas nothing else to think of. But now, things have changed and there is\r\nno more hope, and that which is going to happen must happen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless, I shall protect the young lady from those knights, seeing\r\nDanusia is very weak and consumptive. What if she should die?\"\r\n\r\n\"As God is dear to me you are right. The emaciated lady is scarcely\r\nalive. If she should die?\"\r\n\r\n\"We must leave that with God. But we must now think only of the young\r\nlady of Zgorzelice.\"\r\n\r\n\"By rights, I ought to convey her myself to her fatherland. But it is a\r\ndifficult task. I cannot now leave Zbyszko for many potent reasons. You\r\nsaw how he gnashed his teeth, how he strove to get at the old _comthur_\r\nto kill him, and my wrangling with him. Should that girl die on the road,\r\neven I should be unable to restrain him. And if I shall not be able to\r\nprevent him, nobody else could, and everlasting shame would fall upon him\r\nand upon our clan, which God forbid. Amen!\"\r\n\r\nThen the Bohemian replied:\r\n\r\n\"Bah! There is, I am sure, a simple means. Give me the hangman and I will\r\nkeep him and bring him to Jurand at Spychow and shake him out of the\r\nsack.\"\r\n\r\n\"How clever you are! May God grant you health,\" exclaimed Macko,\r\njoyfully. \"It is a very simple thing, quite simple. Should you succeed in\r\nbringing him to Spychow alive then do with him as you please.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then let me also have that Szczytno bitch, and if she is not troublesome\r\non the road, I will bring her too to Spychow, if she is, then I shall\r\nhang her on a tree.\"\r\n\r\n\"The removal of the pair, whose presence causes much fear to Danusia, may\r\ncontribute to her speedy recovery. But if you take the female servant\r\nwith you, who is going to nurse Danusia?\"\r\n\r\n\"You may find some old woman in the wilderness, or one of the fugitive\r\npeasant women; take hold of the first one you meet, for any one will be\r\nbetter than this. Meanwhile, you must take care of lady Zbyszko.\"\r\n\r\n\"You speak to-day somewhat more prudently than usually. Seeing that\r\nZbyszko is constantly with her, he will also succeed in filling the\r\ndouble position, that of father and mother, for her. Very well, then.\r\nWhen do you intend to start?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall not wait for the dawn; now I must lie down for a while, it is\r\nscarcely midnight yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Wagoner[117] is already in the sky, but the chickens[117] had not\r\nyet made their appearance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank God that we have taken some counsel together, for I was very much\r\ntroubled.\"\r\n\r\nThen the Bohemian stretched himself near the expiring fire, covered\r\nhimself over with the long furred robe and in a moment he fell asleep.\r\nHowever, the sky had not yet paled and it was still deep, dark night when\r\nhe awoke, crept from under the skin, looked at the stars, and stretching\r\nhis somewhat benumbed limbs, he awoke Macko.\r\n\r\n\"It is time for me to move,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Whither?\" asked the semi-conscious Macko, rubbing his eyes with his\r\nfists.\r\n\r\n\"To Spychow.\"\r\n\r\n\"True, I quite forgot. Who is there snoring so loud as to awake the\r\ndead?\"\r\n\r\n\"The knight Arnold. Let me throw a few branches upon the embers, then I\r\nwill go to the men.\"\r\n\r\nThen he left, and hastily returned in a little while, and from a distance\r\nhe called in a low voice:\r\n\r\n\"Sir, there is news, bad news!\"\r\n\r\n\"What has happened?\" Macko exclaimed, jumping to his feet.\r\n\r\n\"The servant has escaped. The men took her among the horses. May thunder\r\nstrike them, and when they fell asleep, she sneaked like a serpent from\r\namong them and escaped. Come, sir!\"\r\n\r\nMacko, in alarm, moved quickly with the Bohemian toward the horses, where\r\nthey found only one man, the others had scattered in pursuit of the\r\nfugitive. But, considering the darkness of the night and the thickets of\r\nthe forest, the search was a foolish undertaking, and after a while they\r\nreturned with hanging heads. Macko began to belabor them quietly with his\r\nfists. Then he returned to the fireplace, for there was nothing to be\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nZbyszko, who was watching in the hut and did not sleep, came in, hearing\r\nthe movements, to ascertain the reason. Macko told him all about his\r\nconsultation with the Bohemian, then he also informed him of the woman's\r\nescape.\r\n\r\n\"It is not a great misfortune,\" he said. \"Because she will either die of\r\nstarvation, or fall into the hands of the peasants who will flay her;\r\nthat is, if she succeeds first in escaping the wolves. It is only to be\r\nregretted that she escaped the punishment at Spychow.\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko also regretted her escaping punishment at Spychow; otherwise he\r\nreceived the news quietly. He did not oppose the departure of the\r\nBohemian with Zygfried, because he was indifferent to anything which did\r\nnot directly concern Danusia. He began to talk about her at once.\r\n\r\n\"I shall take her in front of me on horseback to-morrow, then we shall\r\nproceed.\"\r\n\r\n\"How is it there? Is she asleep?\" inquired Macko.\r\n\r\n\"At times she moans, but I do not know whether she does it in sleep or\r\nwhilst she is awake, but I don't want to disturb her, lest I frighten\r\nher.\"\r\n\r\nFurther conversation was interrupted by the Bohemian, who observing\r\nZbyszko, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"O! your honor, also here! It is now time for me to start. The horses are\r\nready and the old devil is fastened to the saddle. It will soon begin to\r\ndawn because now the nights are short. Good-bye, your grace!\"\r\n\r\n\"God be with you, and health!\"\r\n\r\nBut Hlawa pulled Macko aside again and said:\r\n\r\n\"I wish also to ask you kindly, that in case anything should happen....\r\nYou know, sir ... some misfortune or another ... you would dispatch a\r\ncourier posthaste to Spychow. If we have left Spychow, let him overtake\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Macko, \"I have also forgotten to tell you to take Jagienka\r\nto Plock. Do you understand? Go there to the bishop, and tell him who she\r\nis, that she is the goddaughter of the abbot, for whom there is a will in\r\nthe bishop's possession; then ask his guardianship for her, as that is\r\nalso mentioned in the abbot's will.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if the bishop orders us to remain in Plock?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then obey him in everything and follow his counsel.\"\r\n\r\n\"It shall be so, sir! Good-bye!\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nSir Arnold was informed in the morning of the flight of the servant of\r\nthe Order; he chuckled at the news, on the other hand he held the same\r\nopinion as Macko, viz, that she might fall a prey to the wolves, or be\r\nslain by the Lithuanians. The latter was not at all improbable, since the\r\ninhabitants of that locality who were descendants of the Lithuanians\r\nabhorred the Order and all those who came in contact with it. Some of the\r\nmale population had joined Skirwoillo, others had risen in arms and\r\nslaughtered the Germans here and there; they, their families and their\r\ncattle hid themselves in the inaccessible fastnesses of the forest. They\r\nsearched the following day for the servant, but without success, because\r\nMacko and Zbyszko were occupied with more important matters; hence the\r\nlack of indispensable ardor in the searchers.\r\n\r\nThey were obliged to push on toward Mazowsze; they wished to start at\r\nonce, at the rising of the sun, but they were unable to do so because\r\nDanuska was in a profound sleep, and Zbyszko would not permit her to be\r\ndisturbed.\r\n\r\nHe listened to her moanings during the night-time and thought that she\r\nwas not asleep. He, therefore, promised himself good results. Twice he\r\nstealthily went into the hut; twice he saw by the light falling through\r\ncrevices of the logs her closed eyes, open mouth and glowing face, as\r\nlittle children are wont to have when asleep. His tears melted his heart\r\nat that sight, and he said to her:\r\n\r\n\"May God grant you health my most beloved little flower.\" Then he\r\ncontinued: \"Your troubles are ended, your tears are ended. May the most\r\nmerciful Lord Jesus grant that your happiness may be as inexhaustible as\r\nthe flowing river.\"\r\n\r\nThen, lifting up his simple and upright heart heavenward, he asked\r\nhimself: \"With what can I thank Thee? What shall I render to Thee for Thy\r\nfavors? Shall I offer to the Church some of my wealth, grain, herds, wax,\r\nor something of the same nature acceptable to God?\" He was even about to\r\nvow and name accurately his offerings, but he wished to wait and see the\r\nresult when Danusia awoke, whether she had recovered her senses so that\r\nthere might be reason for thanksgiving.\r\n\r\nAlthough Macko knew well that there would be perfect safety when once in\r\nthe domains of Prince Janusz, nevertheless he was also of the opinion\r\nthat it was better not to disturb Danusia's rest. He therefore kept his\r\nhorses and servants in readiness but waited.\r\n\r\nNevertheless when it was past noon and Danusia continued to sleep, they\r\nwere somewhat alarmed. Zbyszko, who was incessantly watching, looking\r\nthrough the crevices and door, entered suddenly for the third time into\r\nthe hut and sat down upon the block where the servant had dressed Danusia\r\nyesterday.\r\n\r\nHe sat and gazed at her, but she had her eyes closed. But after the lapse\r\nof a short time, not more than it takes to say one \"Pater\" and \"Ave\r\nMaria,\" her lips began to twitch a little, and she whispered as though\r\nshe saw through her closed eyelids:\r\n\r\n\"Zbyszko....\"\r\n\r\nIn an instant be threw himself upon his knees in front of her, grasped\r\nher emaciated hands, which he kissed in ecstasy. Then he addressed her in\r\na broken voice:\r\n\r\n\"Thank God! Danuska! You recognize me.\"\r\n\r\nHis voice awoke her completely. Then she sat up in the bed and with open\r\neyes she repeated:\r\n\r\n\"Zbyszko!\"\r\n\r\nThen she began to blink and look around her in amazement.\r\n\r\n\"You are no more in captivity,\" said Zbyszko. \"I have rescued you from\r\ntheir hands and I am taking you to Spychow.\"\r\n\r\nBut she withdrew her hands from Zbyszko's and said:\r\n\r\n\"All this came to pass because there was no permission from dear papa.\r\nWhere is the princess?\"\r\n\r\n\"Awake, then, dear little berry! The princess is far away and we have\r\nrescued you from the Germans.\"\r\n\r\nThen she appeared not to notice his words but seemed to try to recollect\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\n\"They have also taken away my little lute and have broken it against the\r\nwall. Hey!\"\r\n\r\n\"O God!\" exclaimed Zbyszko.\r\n\r\nHe then observed that she was absent-minded and her eyes were glassy and\r\nher cheeks were glowing, and it struck him that she must be very ill, and\r\nthe mention of his name twice was due to feverish hallucinations.\r\n\r\nThis caused his heart to tremble within him with despair and a cold sweat\r\ncovered his brow.\r\n\r\n\"Danuska!\" he said. \"Do you see and understand me?\"\r\n\r\nBut she replied in a low voice:\r\n\r\n\"Drink! Water!\"\r\n\r\n\"Gracious Lord!\"\r\n\r\nAnd he rushed out, and at the door encountered Macko, who was coming to\r\nascertain her condition. Zbyszko could only tell him hurriedly, \"Water;\"\r\nand then hastened to the stream which ran among neighboring bushes.\r\n\r\nHe returned after a moment with a full pitcher of water and handed it to\r\nDanusia who drank it with much avidity. Macko entered the hut before\r\nZbyszko and seeing the patient he became gloomy.\r\n\r\n\"She is feverish?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Yes!\" groaned Zbyszko.\r\n\r\n\"Does she understand what you say?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\nThe old knight furrowed his brow, then he began to rub his neck and nape\r\nwith his hands.\r\n\r\n\"What is to be done?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is only one thing to be done,\" said Macko.\r\n\r\nBut Danusia, who finished drinking, interrupted him at that moment; she\r\nfixed her dilated pupils on him, and said:\r\n\r\n\"You too I have not offended, have mercy upon me!\"\r\n\r\n\"We have pitied you already, child. We only desire your welfare,\" replied\r\nthe old knight, somewhat agitated.\r\n\r\nThen he turned to Zbyszko:\r\n\r\n\"Listen, there is no use to leave her here. The wafting of the wind and\r\nthe rays of the sun will probably benefit her. Do not lose your head,\r\nboy, but take her to the same cradle wherein she was when they brought\r\nher here--or upon the saddle and let us move on! Do you understand?\"\r\n\r\nThen he left the hut to give the last orders, but he had scarcely looked\r\nin front of him, when he suddenly stood still--as if nailed to the spot.\r\n\r\nA numerous host of infantry armed with pikes and spears was surrounding\r\nthe huts, ovens and clearing, on all sides like a wall.\r\n\r\n\"Germans!\" thought Macko.\r\n\r\nHe was greatly terrified, but in a moment he grasped the hilt of his\r\nsword, clenched his teeth, and had the appearance of a wild beast at bay,\r\nready to defend himself desperately.\r\n\r\nThen the giant-like Arnold, and another knight, advanced toward them from\r\nthe shanty, and when he approached Macko, Arnold said:\r\n\r\n\"Fortune's wheel turns rapidly. I was your prisoner yesterday; you are\r\nmine to-day.\"\r\n\r\nThen he looked haughtily at the old knight as one looks upon an inferior\r\nperson. He was neither a very bad man, nor a very cruel one, but he had\r\nthe defect common to all Knights of the Cross, who in spite of their\r\nbeing well-bred and even humane, looked with contempt upon those whom\r\nthey conquered, neither could they suppress their great pride when they\r\nfelt themselves the stronger.\r\n\r\n\"You are prisoners,\" he repeated, haughtily.\r\n\r\nThe old knight looked around gloomily; he was very serious but audacious\r\nin his heart.\r\n\r\nWere he armored, upon his charger, and with Zbyszko at his side;--if both\r\nhad swords in their hands and were armed with axes, or the terrible\r\n\"woods,\" which the Polish noblemen knew how to wield dexterously, he\r\nwould then have probably attempted to break through, that wall of lances\r\nand spears. Not without reason did the foreign knights, quoting it as an\r\nobjection, exclaim to the Polish in the fight near Wilno: \"You scorn\r\ndeath too much.\"\r\n\r\nBut Macko was on foot facing Arnold, alone, without his coat of mail. He\r\ntherefore looked around and observed that his men had already thrown down\r\ntheir arms, and he thought that Zbyszko too was with Danusia in the hut,\r\nentirely unarmed. As an experienced man, and much accustomed to war, he\r\nknew that there was no chance whatever.\r\n\r\nTherefore he slowly drew the short sword from its sheath and threw it at\r\nthe feet of the knight who stood at Arnold's side, who without the least\r\nof Arnold's haughtiness, but at the same time with benevolence, replied\r\nin excellent Polish:\r\n\r\n\"Your name, sir? I shall not put you in bonds but shall parole you,\r\nbecause I see you are a belted knight, and you treated my brother well.\"\r\n\r\n\"My word!\" replied Macko.\r\n\r\nHaving informed him who he was, Macko inquired whether he would be\r\npermitted to go to the hut and warn his nephew against any mad action.\r\nHis request was granted. He entered and remained there for a while and\r\nemerged with the _misericordia_ in his hands.\r\n\r\n\"My nephew is even without a sword, and he begs you to permit him to\r\nremain with his wife as long as you intend to stay here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let him remain,\" said Arnold's brother. \"I shall send him food and\r\ndrink; we shall not move soon, because the people are tired out and we\r\ntoo are in need of refreshment and rest. Sir, we also invite you to\r\naccompany us.\"\r\n\r\nThen they turned and went to the same fireplace near which Macko had\r\nspent the night. But either from pride, or from ignorance they permitted\r\nhim to walk behind them. But he, being a great warrior, knowing how it\r\nought to be, and adhering strictly to custom, inquired:\r\n\r\n\"Pray, sir, am I your guest or a prisoner?\"\r\n\r\nArnold's brother was shamed at first; he halted and said:\r\n\r\n\"Proceed, sir.\"\r\n\r\nThe old knight went in front, not wishing to hurt the self-respect of the\r\nvery man from whom he expected much.\r\n\r\n\"It is evident, sir, that you are not only acquainted with courteous\r\nspeech, but your behavior is also courtly.\"\r\n\r\nThen, Arnold, who only understood a few words, asked:\r\n\r\n\"Wolfgang, what are you talking about?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am doing the right thing,\" said Wolfgang, who was evidently flattered\r\nby Macko's words.\r\n\r\nThey sat down at the fireside, and began to eat and drink. The lesson\r\nwhich Macko had given to the German was not in vain. Wolfgang regaled\r\nMacko first at the repast.\r\n\r\nThe old knight learned, from the conversation which followed, how they\r\nwere caught in the trap. Wolfgang, the younger brother of Arnold, led\r\nalso the Czluch infantry to Gotteswerder, against the rebellious\r\nZmudzians. Those, however, proceeding from distant counties could not\r\narrive in time to assist Arnold. The latter did not think it necessary to\r\nwait for them because he expected to meet on the road other bodies of\r\ninfantry proceeding from the towns and castles situated on the adjacent\r\nLithuanian frontier. This was the reason that his younger brother delayed\r\nhis march several days, and thus it happened that he found himself on the\r\nroad in the neighborhood of the tar-burners, where the fugitive\r\nwoman-servant of the Order informed him of the ill-luck which had\r\nhappened to his older brother. Arnold, whilst listening to the narrative\r\nwhich was told him in German, smiled with satisfaction; finally he\r\naffirmed that he expected such a result.\r\n\r\nBut the crafty Macko, who, in whatever situation he was, always tried to\r\nfind some remedy, thought that it would be of advantage to him to make\r\nfriends with the Germans, therefore he said after a while:\r\n\r\n\"It is always hard to fall into captivity. Nevertheless, thank God, I am\r\nfortunate to have been delivered into nobody else's hands but yours,\r\nbecause, I believe, that you are real knights and mindful of its honor.\"\r\n\r\nThen Wolfgang closed his eyes and nodded his head somewhat stiffly but\r\nevidently with a feeling of satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThe old knight continued:\r\n\r\n\"That you speak our language well. God has given you understanding in\r\neverything.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know your language, because the Czluchs speak Polish, and my brother\r\nand I served for seven years in those counties.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will in time take office after him. It cannot be otherwise, because\r\nyour brother does not speak our language.\"\r\n\r\n\"He understands it a little, but cannot speak it. My brother is more\r\npowerful, although I am not a weakling either, but of duller wit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hey! He does not seem to me dull.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wolfgang, what does he say?\" asked Arnold again.\r\n\r\n\"He praises you,\" replied Wolfgang.\r\n\r\n\"True, I praised him,\" added Macko, \"because he is a true knight, and\r\nthat is the reason. I tell you frankly that I intended to let him go\r\nentirely free to-day on parole, so that he might go wherever he wished\r\nto, even if he were to present himself in a year's time. Such treatment\r\nis customary among belted knights.\"\r\n\r\nThen he looked attentively into Wolfgang's face, but it was wrinkled, and\r\nhe said:\r\n\r\n\"Were it not for the assistance you have given to the pagan dogs against\r\nus, I also might have let you go on parole.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is not true,\" replied Macko.\r\n\r\nThen the same asperity of discussion as in yesterday's dispute between\r\nArnold and himself was repeated. However, although right was on the old\r\nknight's side, it went on with more difficulty, because Wolfgang was of a\r\nmore severe disposition than his older brother. Nevertheless, one good\r\nthing resulted from the dispute, that Wolfgang learned of all the\r\nabominable practices of the Order at Szczytno, their crooked actions and\r\ntreachery--at the same time he learned of Danusia's misfortunes and\r\ntortures. To those very iniquities which Macko had thrown in his teeth he\r\nhad no reply. He was obliged to acknowledge that the revenge was\r\njustifiable, and that the Polish knights were right in their acts, and\r\nfinally said:\r\n\r\n\"Upon the glorified bones of St. Liborus! I swear, that I also will not\r\npity Danveld. They said of him that he practiced black magic, but God's\r\npower and justice is mightier than black magic. As to Zygfried, I am not\r\nsure whether he also served the devil or not. But I shall not hunt for\r\nhim, because first, I have no horses, and on the other hand, if what you\r\nsaid is true that he outraged that girl, then let him also never return\r\nfrom Hades!\"\r\n\r\nHere he stretched himself and continued:\r\n\r\n\"God! Help me till the hour of my death.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how will it be with that unfortunate martyr?\" inquired Macko. \"Are\r\nyou not going to permit us to take her home? Has she to suffer agony in\r\nyour underground prisons? Remember, I beseech you, God's wrath!...\"\r\n\r\n\"I have nothing against the woman,\" replied Wolfgang, roughly. \"Let one\r\nof you take her home to her father, on condition that he present himself\r\nafterward, but the other must remain here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah! But what if he swears upon his knightly honor and upon the lance of\r\nSt. Jerzey?\"\r\n\r\nWolfgang hesitated a little because it was a great oath; but at that\r\nmoment Arnold asked a third time:\r\n\r\n\"What does he say?\"\r\n\r\nWhen he informed himself of the matter he opposed it vehemently and\r\nrudely. He had his private reasons for it. First, he was conquered by\r\nSkirwoillo, then in single combat, by the Polish knight. He also knew\r\nthat owing to the destruction of the army at the previous engagement it\r\nwould be impossible for his brother to advance with his infantry to\r\nGotteswerder and he would be obliged to return to Malborg. Moreover he\r\nknew that he would be obliged to give an account to the Master and\r\nmarshal for the defeat, and that it would be to his advantage if he were\r\nable to show even one important prisoner. To produce one knight alive is\r\nof more value than to explain that two such were captured....\r\n\r\nWhen Macko heard the loud protestations and oaths of Arnold, he resolved,\r\nsince nothing else could be obtained, to take what was previously\r\noffered. Turning to Wolfgang he said:\r\n\r\n\"Then, I beg one more favor--permit me to acquaint my nephew; I am sure\r\nhe will see the wisdom of remaining with his wife, while I go with you.\r\nAt all events, permit me to let him know that he has nothing to say\r\nagainst it, for it is your will.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it is all the same to me,\" replied Wolfgang. \"But let us talk\r\nabout the ransom which your nephew must bring for himself and you.\r\nBecause all depends on that.\"\r\n\r\n\"About ransom?\" inquired Macko, who would have preferred to postpone that\r\nconversation to a later period. \"Have we not time enough to talk about\r\nit? Where a belted knight is concerned his word is of equal value with\r\nready money, and as to the sum it can be left to conscience. There, near\r\nGotteswerder, we captured one of your important knights, a certain de\r\nLorche. And my nephew (it was he who captured him) paroled him. No\r\nallusion whatever was made to the amount of ransom.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you captured de Lorche?\" inquired Wolfgang, sharply. \"I know him.\r\nHe is a powerful knight. But why did we not meet him on the road?\"\r\n\r\n\"He, evidently, did not go this way, but went to Gotteswerder, or to\r\nRagniec,\" replied Macko.\r\n\r\n\"That knight comes from a powerful and renowned family,\" repeated\r\nWolfgang. \"You have made a splendid capture! It is well then, that you\r\nmentioned it. But I cannot let you go for nothing.\"\r\n\r\nMacko chewed his mustache; nevertheless he lifted up his head haughtily,\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n\"Apart from that, we know our value.\"\r\n\r\n\"So much the better,\" said the younger von Baden, and immediately added:\r\n\r\n\"So much the better. It is not for us, for we are humble monks, who have\r\nvowed poverty, but for the Order that will enjoy your money, to God's\r\npraise.\"\r\n\r\nMacko did not reply to that but only looked at Wolfgang, with such an\r\nexpression as to say: \"Tell that to somebody else.\" After awhile they\r\nbegan to bargain. It was a difficult and irritable task for the old\r\nknight. On the one hand he was very sensitive to any loss, and on the\r\nother hand, he understood that he would not succeed in naming a too small\r\nsum for Zbyszko and himself. He therefore wriggled like an eel,\r\nespecially when Wolfgang, in spite of his polished words and manners, had\r\nshown himself excessively grasping and as hard hearted as a stone. Only\r\none thought comforted Macko and that was, that de Lorche would have pay\r\nfor all, but even that, the loss of de Lorche's ransom, worried him.\r\nZygfried's ransom he did not count in the affair because he thought that\r\nJurand, and even Zbyszko, would not renounce his head for any price.\r\n\r\nAfter long haggling they finally compromised upon the sum in _grzywiens_\r\nand the time of payment, and stipulated upon the number of horses and men\r\nZbyszko should take with him. Macko went to inform Zbyszko, and advised\r\nhim not to tarry but depart at once, for something else might meanwhile\r\ncome into the German's head.\r\n\r\n\"So it is with knightly conditions,\" said Macko, sighing. \"Yesterday you\r\nheld them by the head, to-day they hold you. Well, it is a hard lot. God\r\ngrant that our turn may come. But now, it is necessary not to lose time.\r\nIf you hasten on, you may yet overtake Hlawa and you will be safer\r\ntogether, and once out of the wilderness and in the inhabited region of\r\nMazowsze you will find hospitality and assistance in every nobleman's or\r\n_wlodyka's_ house. In our country they do not refuse those things even to\r\na foreigner, how much more to one of their own people! The condition of\r\nthe poor woman might also be improved thereby.\"\r\n\r\nThen he looked at Danusia, who was in feverish half-sleep, breathing\r\nquickly and loudly, with her transparent hands stretched upon the black\r\nbearskin, trembling with fever.\r\n\r\nMacko made the sign of the cross at her and said:\r\n\r\n\"Hey, take her and go! May God restore her, for it appears to me that her\r\nthread of life is being spun very thin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not say that!\" exclaimed Zbyszko, in a distressed tone.\r\n\r\n\"God's power! I will order your horses to be brought here--and you must\r\nleave at once!\"\r\n\r\nHe went out and arranged everything for the journey. The Turks, whom\r\nZawisza had presented to them, led the horses and the litter, filled with\r\nmosses and fur, and they were headed by Zbyszko's man, Wit. Zbyszko left\r\nthe hut in a moment, carrying Danusia in his arms. There was something\r\ntouching in that, so that even the brothers von Baden, whose curiosity\r\nhad drawn them to the hut, looked curiously into the childlike face of\r\nDanuska. Her face was like that of the holy images in the churches of Our\r\nLady, and her sickness was so great that she could not hold up her head\r\nwhich lay heavily on the young knight's arm. They looked at each other\r\nwith astonishment, and in their hearts arose a feeling against the\r\nauthors of her woes.\r\n\r\n\"Zygfried has the heart of a hangman, and not that of a knight,\"\r\nwhispered Wolfgang to Arnold, \"and that serpent, although she is the\r\ncause of your liberty, I will order to be beaten with rods.\"\r\n\r\nThey were also touched when they saw Zbyszko carrying her in his arms, as\r\na mother is wont to carry her child. They comprehended how great was his\r\nlove for her, for youthful blood coursed in the veins of them both.\r\n\r\nHe hesitated for awhile whether to keep the patient on horseback near his\r\nbreast on the road or to lay her in the litter. Finally he resolved upon\r\nthe latter course, thinking that she might feel more comfortable in a\r\nrecumbent posture. Then he approached his uncle and bowed to kiss his\r\nhand and bid him good-bye. But Macko, who, as a matter of fact, loved\r\nZbyszko as the apple of his eye, was somewhat disinclined to show his\r\nagitation in the presence of the Germans; nevertheless he could not\r\nrestrain himself, and embracing him strongly, pressed his lips to his\r\nabundant golden hair.\r\n\r\n\"May God guide you,\" he said. \"But remember the old man, for it is always\r\na hardship to be in captivity.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall not forget,\" replied Zbyszko. \"May the most Holy Mother comfort\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"God will recompense you for this and for all your kindness.\"\r\n\r\nZbyszko mounted his horse immediately, but Macko recollected something\r\nand hastened to his side, and placing his hand upon Zbyszko's knee, he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Listen, if you should overtake Hlawa, remember not to molest Zygfried,\r\notherwise you will bring down reproach upon yourself and upon my gray\r\nhead. Leave him to Jurand, but do nothing to him yourself. Swear to me\r\nupon your sword and honor.\"\r\n\r\n\"As long as you do not return,\" replied Zbyszko, \"I shall even prevent\r\nJurand from harming him in order to prevent the Germans from injuring you\r\non Zygfried's account.\"\r\n\r\n\"So, and you seem to care for me?\"\r\n\r\nAnd the young knight smiled sadly. \"You well know that, I am sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Move on and good-bye.\"\r\n\r\nThe horses moved on, and in a little while disappeared in the hazelnut\r\nthickets. Macko felt suddenly very much troubled and lonely and his heart\r\nwas torn for that beloved boy in whom rested the entire hope of the\r\nfamily. But he soon got rid of his sorrow, for he was a man of valor and\r\ncould master his emotions.\r\n\r\n\"Thank God that I am a prisoner and not he.\"\r\n\r\nThen he turned toward the Germans and said:\r\n\r\n\"And you, gentlemen, when will you start and whither are you going?\"\r\n\r\n\"When it is agreeable to us,\" replied Wolfgang, \"but we go to Malborg,\r\nwhere, sir, you must first appear before the Master.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hey! I shall yet have to forfeit my head there, for the help I have\r\ngiven to the Zmudzians,\" said Macko to himself.\r\n\r\nNevertheless his mind was at rest when he thought that de Lorche was in\r\nreserve; the Baden knights themselves would protect his head even if it\r\nwere only for the ransom.\r\n\r\n\"Otherwise,\" he said to himself, \"Zbyszko will neither be obliged to\r\npresent himself nor lessen his fortune.\"\r\n\r\nThat thought caused him a certain relief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nZbyszko was unable to overtake Hlawa, because the latter traveled day and\r\nnight, and only rested as much as was absolutely necessary to avoid the\r\nbreaking down of the horses, which only subsisted on grass, and were\r\nconsequently faint and unable to withstand such long marches as they\r\ncould in regions where oats could be easily procured. Hlawa neither\r\nspared himself, nor took into consideration the advanced age and weakness\r\nof Zygfried. The old knight suffered terribly, especially because the\r\nsinewy Macko had previously wrenched his bones. But still worse were the\r\nmosquitoes which swarmed in the humid wilderness, and as his hands were\r\nbound and his legs fastened beneath the horse's belly, he was unable to\r\ndrive them away. Hlawa did not directly torture him in the least, but he\r\nhad no compassion for him, and only unfastened his right hand to enable\r\nhim to eat when he stopped for refreshment.\r\n\r\n\"Eat, ravening wolf, so that I may bring you alive to the lord of\r\nSpychow.\" Such were the words of inducement to stimulate Zygfried's\r\nappetite. At first Zygfried resolved to starve himself to death; but when\r\nhe heard the announcement that in such case Hlawa would forcibly open his\r\nteeth with a knife and stuff the food down his throat, he gave up his\r\nintention in order to avoid such a degradation of the Order and knightly\r\nhonor.\r\n\r\nBut the Bohemian was particularly anxious to arrive at Spychow before his\r\nmaster, so that he might spare his adored young lady from shame. Simple,\r\nbut courageous and fearless, he was not void of knightly noble sentiment,\r\nand he well understood that Jagienka would be humiliated if she were at\r\nSpychow together with Danusia. \"It will be possible to tell the bishop,\r\nin Plock (he thought) that the old knight of Bogdaniec, owing to his\r\nguardianship, thought it necessary to take her with him, and then, as\r\nsoon as it was known that she was the bishop's ward, and besides\r\nZgorzelice she was also entitled to the abbot's estate, then even the\r\n_wojewoda's_ son would not be too great for her.\" That thought\r\ncontributed to soothe his troubled mind. The very reason of his conveying\r\ngood news to Spychow troubled his mind, as it would be the source of\r\nmisfortune to Jagienka.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful face of Sieciechowna, as red as an apple, often appeared\r\nbefore his eyes. On such occasions, he would, if the road permitted,\r\ntickle the horse's sides with his spurs, because he wanted to reach\r\nSpychow as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThey traveled along intricate roads, or rather no roads at all, through\r\nthe woods, going straight ahead as the reaper does. The Bohemian knew\r\nthat by pushing on a little toward the west and constantly in a southerly\r\ndirection, he would reach Mazowsze and then all would go well. During the\r\ndaytime he followed the sun, and at night he marched by the stars. The\r\nwilderness in front of him appeared endless. Days and nights passed by.\r\nMore than once he thought that Zbyszko would not succeed in bringing the\r\nwoman through the terrible wilderness alive, where there was no food to\r\nbe procured, and where the horses must be guarded by night from wolves\r\nand bears. During the daytime they had to get out of the way of herds of\r\nbison and aurochs; where the terrible wild-boar sharpens his crooked\r\ntusks against the roots of the pine-trees, and very often it happened\r\nthat those who made no use of the crossbow, or did not strike with the\r\npike into the sides of a deer or young boar, such passed whole days\r\nwithout food.\r\n\r\n\"How will it be here,\" thought Hlawa, \"with a maiden who is already\r\nalmost tortured to death!\"\r\n\r\nNow and then, it happened that they had to cross swamps and deep ravines,\r\nwhich continuous spring rains filled for days with rushing streams.\r\nLakes, too, were not wanting in the wilderness, in which they saw at\r\nsunset whole flocks of deer and elk disporting in the red transparent\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\nOften they also perceived smoke which showed the presence of people. On\r\nseveral occasions Hlawa approached such forest settlements, whence wild\r\npeople would issue, clothed with skins upon their naked bodies, armed\r\nwith clubs and bows, and looking from under their shaggy-tangled hair;\r\nthe men took them to be werewolves. It was necessary to take advantage of\r\ntheir first astonishment whilst they were looking at the knights, and\r\nleave them in the greatest haste.\r\n\r\nArrows whistled twice near the Bohemian's ears, and he heard the shouts\r\nof \"Wokili\" (Germans!) But he preferred to run away rather than to make\r\nhimself known. Finally, after a few days he began to think that perhaps\r\nhe had already crossed the frontier, but there was nobody from whom he\r\ncould ascertain. Only when he met some colonists who spoke the Polish\r\nlanguage did he get the information, that he finally stood upon\r\nMazowszian soil.\r\n\r\nThere it was better, although the whole eastern part of Mazowsze was also\r\none wilderness. But it did not terminate uninhabitated as the other did.\r\nWhen the Bohemian arrived at a colony they were less shy--perhaps because\r\nthey were not so much brought up in constant hatred, or that the Bohemian\r\ncould converse with them in Polish. The only trouble with them was the\r\nboundless curiosity of the people who surrounded the travelers, and\r\noverwhelmed them with questions. When they were informed that he carried\r\na prisoner, a Knight of the Cross, they said:\r\n\r\n\"Give him to us, sir, we will take care of him!\"\r\n\r\nThey importuned the Bohemian so much, that he often became very angry\r\nwith them, but at the same time, he explained, that he could not grant\r\ntheir request because the prisoner belonged to the prince. Then only they\r\nrelented. Later on when he arrived in the inhabited places among the\r\nnobles and land-owners, he did not get off so easily. The hatred against\r\nthe Order was raging, because everywhere they still remembered vividly\r\nthe wrongs which the prince had suffered at its hands when, in time of\r\npeace, the Knights of the Cross had kidnapped the prince near Zlotorja\r\nand imprisoned him. They did not wish to dispatch Zygfried at once. But\r\nhere and there, one of the doughty Polish nobles would say: \"Unbind him\r\nand we will give him arms, and then challenge him to deadly combat.\" To\r\nsuch the Bohemian would give a potent reason: that the right to vengeance\r\nbelonged to the unfortunate lord of Spychow, and one must not deprive him\r\nof that privilege.\r\n\r\nThe journey through the inhabited region was easy; because there were\r\ngood roads and there was plenty of provender for the horses. The Bohemian\r\ncontinued his uninterrupted march until after ten days' travel he arrived\r\nbefore Corpus Christi day at Spychow.\r\n\r\nHe arrived in the evening, at the same time as when he had brought the\r\nnews from Macko, that he had left Szczytno for the Zmudz country. It also\r\nhappened now as before, that Jagienka, observing him through the window,\r\nrushed toward him, and he fell at her feet. He was speechless for a\r\nwhile. But she soon lifted him up and took him aside, as she did not wish\r\nto interrogate him in the presence of others.\r\n\r\n\"What news?\" she asked, trembling with impatience, and scarcely able to\r\ncatch her breath. \"Is she alive? Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Alive! Well!\"\r\n\r\n\"Has she been found?\"\r\n\r\n\"She has. They rescued her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Praised be Jesus Christ!\"\r\n\r\nBut whilst she spoke these words her face assumed a deathly pallor,\r\nbecause all her hopes crumbled into dust.\r\n\r\nHowever, her strength did not forsake her, neither did she lose\r\nconsciousness. After a moment she mastered herself entirely and enquired\r\nagain:\r\n\r\n\"When will she be here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Within a few days! She is sick and the road is very bad.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is she sick?\"\r\n\r\n\"Martyred. Her reason is confused with her tortures.\"\r\n\r\n\"Merciful Jesus!\"\r\n\r\nSilence reigned for a moment. Jagienka's lips became pale and they moved\r\nas though in prayer.\r\n\r\n\"Did she recognize Zbyszko?\" she asked again.\r\n\r\n\"She may have done so, but I am not sure, because I left at once, in\r\norder to inform you, lady, of the news. That is the reason why I am\r\nstanding here.\"\r\n\r\n\"God reward you. Tell me how it happened!\"\r\n\r\nThe Bohemian related briefly how they rescued Danusia, how they captured\r\nthe giant Arnold together with Zygfried. He also informed them that he\r\nhad brought Zygfried with him, because the young knight wished to present\r\nhim to Jurand so that the latter might avenge himself.\r\n\r\n\"I must now go to Jurand,\" said Jagienka, when he had finished.\r\n\r\nThen she left, but Hlawa had not been long alone when Sieciechowna rushed\r\ntoward him from the next apartment; but either because not entirely\r\nconscious, owing to the fatigue and exceeding great troubles he had\r\npassed through, or owing to his yearning for her, he entirely forgot\r\nhimself when he saw her; suffice it to say he caught her by the waist,\r\npressed her to his breast and kissed her eyes, cheeks and mouth in such a\r\nmanner as though he had previously informed her of everything that was\r\nnecessary for her to know before the kissing began.\r\n\r\nPerhaps he had already told her everything in spirit, when upon the road,\r\ntherefore he kissed her and kept on kissing endlessly. He embraced her so\r\nstrongly that she lost her breath. Yet she did not defend herself, at\r\nfirst from surprise and then, from faintness, so that were it not for\r\nHlawa's powerful grasp she would have fallen to the ground.\r\n\r\nFortunately this did not last too long because distant steps were heard\r\non the stairs, and after a moment, Father Kaleb rushed into the room.\r\n\r\nThey then quickly separated, and the priest began to overwhelm him with\r\nquestions. But Hlawa was unable to catch his breath and replied with\r\ndifficulty. The priest thought that his condition was owing to fatigue.\r\nBut when the news of the finding of Danusia, her rescue and the presence\r\nof her torturer in Spychow was confirmed by Hlawa, he fell upon his knees\r\nto thank God for it. Meanwhile Hlawa quieted down a little, and when the\r\npriest got up, he was able to repeat his story in a more intelligent and\r\nquiet manner in what way Danusia had been found and how they had rescued\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\"God did not deliver her,\" the priest said, whilst listening to his\r\nnarrative, \"in order that her reason and soul should be restored whilst\r\nshe was in the darkness and in the power of the unclean. Let Jurand only\r\nlay his saintly hand upon her, and offer only one of his prayers, and he\r\nwill restore her reason and health.\"\r\n\r\n\"Knight Jurand?\" asked the Bohemian, with astonishment. \"Does he possess\r\nso much power? Can he become a saint whilst he is alive?\"\r\n\r\n\"Before God he is considered a saint even whilst he is alive. But when he\r\ndies the people will have one more patron saint in heaven;--a martyr.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you said, reverend father,'that if he were only to lay his saintly\r\nhands upon the head of his daughter.' Has his right hand grown again? for\r\nI know you prayed for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I said: 'the hands,' as it is customary to say,\" replied the priest.\r\n\"But one hand is enough, if God will.\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely,\" answered Hlawa.\r\n\r\nBut in his voice there was something discouraging when he thought that it\r\nappeared like a miracle. Jagienka's entrance interrupted further\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n\"Now I have informed him carefully of the news,\" she said. \"To avoid the\r\ndeath, which sudden joy might cause, but he fell with the cross in his\r\nhands and prayed.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure that he will be in such a condition till morning, as he is\r\naccustomed to lie prostrate in prayer whole nights,\" said Father Kaleb.\r\n\r\nAnd so it happened; they called to see him several times and each time\r\nthey found him stretched on the ground, not asleep but in such a fervent\r\nprayer that it bordered on perfect ecstasy. Now the watchman, whose duty\r\nit was to watch according to custom over Spychow from the top of the\r\ntower, said afterward that he observed that night an extraordinary\r\nbrightness in the house of the \"Old lord.\"\r\n\r\nVery early on the following morning when Jagienka called again to see\r\nhim, he showed his desire to see Hlawa and the prisoner. The prisoner was\r\nbrought before him immediately from the dungeon. He was tightly bound\r\nwith his hands crossed upon his chest. All, including Tolima, advanced\r\ntoward the old man.\r\n\r\nBut owing to a dark, cloudy day and the insufficient light of a\r\nthreatening tempest, which penetrated the bladder panes, the Bohemian was\r\nunable to see Jurand well. But as soon as his keen eyes grew accustomed\r\nto the darkness and looked upon him, he scarcely recognized him. The\r\ngigantic man had dwindled to a giant skeleton. His face was so white that\r\nit did not much differ from his snow-white hair, and when he bowed on the\r\narm of his chair, with his eyelids closed, he appeared to Hlawa like a\r\nreal corpse.\r\n\r\nIn front of the chair stood a table; upon it were a crucifix, a pitcher\r\nof water, and a loaf of black bread in which stuck the _misericordia_,\r\nthat terrible knife which the knights made use of in dispatching the\r\nwounded. Besides bread and water, Jurand enjoyed no other nourishment.\r\nHis only garment consisted of coarse sackcloth upon his naked body\r\nfastened with a straw girdle. Such was the manner of living of that once\r\npowerful and terrible knight of Spychow, since his return from his\r\ncaptivity in Szczytno.\r\n\r\nNow, when he heard them arrive, he kicked aside the tame she-wolf which\r\ngnawed at his bare feet, It was then that Jurand appeared to the Bohemian\r\nlike a real corpse. There was suspense for a moment, because they\r\nexpected some sign from him ordering them to talk: but he sat motionless,\r\npale, and peaceful; his mouth, a little opened, had the real appearance\r\nof one who is plunged in the everlasting sleep of death.\r\n\r\nJagienka finally announced that Hlawa was there, and gently enquired:\r\n\r\n\"Do you wish to hear him?\"\r\n\r\nOld Jurand nodded his head affirmatively, and the Bohemian began, for the\r\nthird time, to narrate briefly the story of the battles with the Germans\r\nnear Gotteswerder. He told him of the fight with Arnold von Baden and how\r\nthey had rescued Danusia. Not wishing to add new pains to the sufferings\r\nof the old martyr and destroy the effect produced by the good news of\r\nDanusia's rescue, he purposely avoided relating that her mind suffered\r\nfor a long time on account of terrible distress. But, on the other hand,\r\nas his heart was filled with rancor against the Knights of the Cross, and\r\nthirsting to see Zygfried receive his deserved terrible chastisement, he\r\npurposely mentioned the fact that when they found her she was terrified,\r\nemaciated and sick, and it was evident that they must have treated her as\r\nexecutioners do, and had she remained longer in their terrible hands she\r\nwould have withered and perished as a little flower withers and perishes\r\nwhen trodden under foot.\r\n\r\nWhilst Hlawa recited the news, the sky was overcast and the clouds grew\r\ndarker, which showed the approach of a storm. The copper-colored masses\r\nof clouds which hung over Spychow rolled more heavily upon one another.\r\n\r\nJurand was motionless and listened to the recital without any trembling,\r\nso that he appeared to be in deep sleep. Nevertheless, he heard and\r\nunderstood everything, for when Hlawa told the story of Danusia's woes,\r\ntwo large drops of tears rolled down his cheeks from the hollows of his\r\neyes. Only one earthly feeling still remained in his breast, and that was\r\nlove for his child.\r\n\r\nThen his blue lips began to move in prayer. The first distant\r\nthunderclaps were heard outside. Now and then lightning illuminated the\r\nwindows. He prayed long, and again the tears trickled down upon his white\r\nbeard. When he finally ceased to pray, long silence reigned, which was so\r\nmuch prolonged as to cause uneasiness to those present because they did\r\nnot know what to do.\r\n\r\nFinally, old Tolima, who was Jurand's right hand, his companion in all\r\nbattles, and the chief guard of Spychow, said:\r\n\r\n\"That man of Hades, that werewolf Knight of the Cross who tortured you\r\nand your child stands now before you. Give a sign what shall be done to\r\nhim, and in what manner we shall chastise him!\"\r\n\r\nUpon hearing these words, rays of light crossed Jurand's face and he\r\nnodded to them to bring the prisoner near him. And in the twinkling of an\r\neye, two men grasped him by the shoulders and placed him in front of the\r\nold man, who stretched out his hand to Zygfried's face, which he touched\r\nas though to feel the outlines and recognize it for the last time. Then\r\nhe lowered his hand to Zygfried's chest upon which he felt his bound\r\nhands, touched the fastening ropes, again closed his eyelids and bowed\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\nThey thought that he was absorbed in thought, but whether that was so or\r\nnot, it was not of long duration, because after a while he started out of\r\nhis reverie and pointed with his hand in the direction of the loaf of\r\nbread, in which the ill-omened _misericordia_ stuck.\r\n\r\nThen, Jagienka, the Bohemian, even old Tolima and all present held their\r\nbreath. It was a hundredfold well-deserved punishment, a righteous\r\nrevenge. Yet their hearts palpitated at the thought that the half-alive\r\nold man should be groping to slash the bound prisoner.\r\n\r\nBut Jurand, seizing the knife in the middle, ran his finger along its\r\nsharp edge, so that he might feel the thing he was cutting, and began to\r\nsever the bonds upon Zygfried's arms.\r\n\r\nAt that sight, all were seized with amazement, because they understood\r\nhis desire and could scarcely believe it. However, that was too much for\r\nthem. Hlawa was the first to murmur; he was followed by Tolima and the\r\nother men. Only the priest Kaleb began to ask, in a voice broken with\r\nunrestrained weeping:\r\n\r\n\"Brother Jurand, what are your wishes? Do you intend to give the prisoner\r\nhis liberty?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is so!\" replied Jurand, nodding his head affirmatively.\r\n\r\n\"No punishment for him, nor vengeance? Is that your desire?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is!\" and he nodded again.\r\n\r\nOpen discontent was shown in the murmurs and anger of the men, but the\r\npriest did not wish to belittle such an unheard-of deed of mercy. He\r\nturned to the murmurers and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Now who dares to oppose the saint? Down upon your knees!\"\r\n\r\nThen he knelt down himself and began to say:\r\n\r\n\"Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom\r\ncome....\"\r\n\r\nAnd he repeated the Lord's Prayer to the end. At the words: \"And forgive\r\nus our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us,\" he\r\ndirected his eyes involuntarily toward Jurand, whose face actually\r\nassumed an unearthly radiance.\r\n\r\nThat sight, and that expressive prayer crushed the hearts of all present;\r\neven old Tolima, the confirmed, hardened warrior, made the sign of the\r\nHoly Cross, and immediately embraced Jurand's feet and said:\r\n\r\n\"Lord, if you want your wishes to be accomplished, then the prisoner\r\nshould be led to the frontier.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes!\" nodded Jurand.\r\n\r\nThe storm approached nearer and nearer and the lightning more frequently\r\nilluminated the windows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTwo horsemen, in the midst of the storm and pouring rain, reached the\r\nfrontier of Spychow. They were Zygfried and Tolima. The last mentioned\r\naccompanied the German to protect him from the waylaying peasants and the\r\nservants of Spychow, who burned with hatred and revenge toward him.\r\nZygfried was unarmed, but he was not fettered. The rainstorm, driven by\r\nthe tempest, had already overtaken them. Now and then, when it suddenly\r\nthundered, the horses reared. They traveled in deep silence in a ravine.\r\nOwing to the narrowness of the road, they were at times so near that they\r\nstruck each other's stirrups. Tolima, who had been accustomed to guard\r\nprisoners for many years, frequently looked at Zygfried watchfully, as\r\nthough he were guarding against his escaping suddenly, and an involuntary\r\nshudder seized him every time he looked at Zygfried, because his eyes\r\nappeared to him to be shining in the darkness like the eyes of an evil\r\nspirit, or of a vampire. It struck Tolima that it would be advisable to\r\nmake the sign of the cross over Zygfried, but he refrained from doing so,\r\nbecause, he thought, that under the sign of the cross, he would hear\r\nunearthly voices, and Zygfried would be transformed into a hideous being.\r\nHis teeth chattered and his fear increased. The old soldier who could\r\nfight singly against a whole band of Germans and fall fearlessly upon\r\nthem, as a hawk swoops upon a flock of partridges, was nevertheless\r\nafraid of unclean spirits, and wanted to have nothing to do with them. He\r\nwould have preferred simply to point out to the German the road and\r\nreturn; but he was ashamed of himself, therefore he led him as far as the\r\nfrontier.\r\n\r\nIt was then, when they had drawn near the border of the Spychow forest,\r\nthat the rain ceased, and the clouds were lit up with a strange yellowish\r\nlight, that Zygfried's eyes lost that above-mentioned unnatural glare.\r\nBut Tolima was seized with another temptation: \"They ordered me,\" he said\r\nto himself, \"to lead this mad dog safely as far as the frontier. I have\r\ndone that; but must the torturer of my master and his daughter leave\r\nwithout revenge and punishment? Would it not be a proper and God-pleasing\r\ndeed to kill him? Ay! I should like to challenge him to deadly combat,\r\nbut he is not armed. Very soon at _Pan_ Warcimow's farm, about a mile\r\nfrom here, they will supply him with some weapon, and then I will\r\nchallenge him. With God's help I shall overthrow him, then kill him, and\r\nfitly, cut off his head and bury it in the dung!\" These were the words\r\nwhich Tolima said to himself. Then looking greedily at the German he\r\nbegan to dilate his nostrils as if he already smelt fresh blood. He\r\nfought hard in his mind with that desire; it was hard wrestling with\r\nhimself, until he reflected that Jurand had not only granted to the\r\nprisoner his life and freedom as far as the frontier, but also beyond it,\r\notherwise Jurand's holy deed would have no merit and the heavenly reward\r\nfor him would thereby be lessened. He finally prevailed over himself, and\r\nreining in his horse, said;\r\n\r\n\"Here is our border; your side is not far from here; proceed, you are\r\nfree; and if the qualms of conscience do not take you off, or God's\r\nthunder does not strike you, then you need not fear man.\"\r\n\r\nThen Tolima returned; and Zygfried proceeded. His face looked as if\r\npetrified and a savage expression was depicted upon it. He did not reply\r\na single word, as though he heard nothing that was said to him. He\r\ncontinued his journey now upon a wider road and had the appearance of one\r\nwho is fast asleep.\r\n\r\nThe break in the storm and the brightening of the sky only lasted a short\r\ntime. It darkened again; so much so that it looked like the darkness of\r\nnight. The clouds traveled so low that they quite enveloped the forest\r\nand from the hills came down an ill-boding obscurity, a kind of hissing\r\nand growling of impatient vampires, who were kept back by the angel of\r\nthe storm. Blinding lightning illuminated the threatening sky every\r\nmoment and terrified the land. Then one could see the broad highway\r\nextending between the two black walls of forest, and upon it a lonely\r\nhorseman. Zygfried moved on in a semi-conscious condition, consumed by\r\nfever. Despair had lacerated his heart since Rotgier's death and filled\r\nit with crimes of revenge. Remorse, awful visions, soul stirrings had\r\nalready tortured his mind in the past to such a degree that with great\r\neffort he had to fight madness; there were even moments when he could\r\nfight no longer and he surrendered. But the new troubles, fatigue upon\r\nthe road under the strong hand of the Bohemian, the night he had passed\r\nin the dungeon of Spychow, the uncertainty of his fate, and above all,\r\nthat unheard-of and almost superhuman deed, had quite terrified him. All\r\nthis had brought him to a climax. There were moments when his mind became\r\nso stupefied that he entirely lost his judgment and he did not know what\r\nhe was doing. Then the fever awoke him and, at the same time awoke within\r\nhim a certain dull feeling of despair, destruction, and perdition,--a\r\nfeeling that all hope was already gone, extinguished and ended. He felt\r\nthat about him was only night, night and darkness, a horrible abyss into\r\nwhich he must plunge.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a voice whispered in his ear:\r\n\r\n\"Go! Go!\"\r\n\r\nAnd he looked around him and saw the very image of death, a skeleton\r\nmounted upon a skeleton horse, pressing closely beside him, with his\r\nwhite rattling bones.\r\n\r\n\"Is it you?\" asked Zygfried.\r\n\r\n\"Yes it is. Go! Go!\"\r\n\r\nBut at that moment he glanced to the other side and observed that he had\r\nanother companion there. Stirrup to stirrup rode a form, appearing\r\nsomewhat like a human being but for his face and head. It had the head of\r\nan animal, with raised long pointed ears, covered with black shaggy hair.\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\" asked Zygfried.\r\n\r\nBut the being, instead of replying, showed its teeth and growled.\r\n\r\nZygfried closed his eyes, but in a moment he heard a louder clattering of\r\nbones and the voice speaking to him in the same ear:\r\n\r\n\"Time! Time! Hurry on, go!\"\r\n\r\n\"I go!\" he replied.\r\n\r\nBut that last reply came from his breast and seemed to have been uttered\r\nby somebody else. Then, impelled as it were by an external unconquerable\r\npower, he dismounted and took off his high knight's saddle, and then the\r\nbridle. His companions also dismounted, and did not leave him for a\r\nmoment. They left the middle of the road and went toward the margin of\r\nthe wood. There, the black being bent down a branch of a tree and\r\nassisted him in fastening to it the strap of the bridle.\r\n\r\n\"Hurry!\" whispered Death.\r\n\r\n\"Hurry!\" whistled some voices from the tops of the trees.\r\n\r\nZygfried, who was like one plunged in deep sleep, drew through the buckle\r\nthe other end of the strap so as to form a noose. Then he stepped upon\r\nthe saddle which he had placed in front of the tree, and adjusted the\r\nnoose upon his neck.\r\n\r\n\"Push back the saddle! ... Already! Ah!\"\r\n\r\nThe saddle, which he pushed with his feet, rolled away several paces and\r\nthe body of the unfortunate Knight of the Cross hung heavily. It seemed\r\nto him, only for a short moment, that he heard a kind of smothering,\r\nsnorting and roaring, and that abominable vampire threw itself upon him,\r\nshook him and then began to tear his breast with its teeth to rend his\r\nheart. Then, as the light of his eyes was about extinguished he yet saw\r\nsomething else; for lo, death dissolved into a whitish cloud, which\r\nslowly approached him, embraced him, and finally surrounded and covered\r\nall with a dismal and impenetrable veil.\r\n\r\nAt that moment the storm broke with great fury. Thunder roared in the\r\nmiddle of the road with such a terrible crash that it seemed as though\r\nthe earth was shaken to its very foundations. The whole forest bent under\r\nthe tempest. The noise of whistling, hissing, howling, creaking of the\r\ntrunks, and cracking of the broken branches, filled the depths of the\r\nwoods. The tempest-driven sheets of rain hid the world from sight. Only\r\nat short intervals, when lit up by blood-colored lightning, could be seen\r\nthe wild dangling body of Zygfried by the roadside.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following morning, advancing upon the same road, a numerous train\r\nmight be seen. In front was Jagienkna, with Sieciechowna and the\r\nBohemian. Behind them moved the wagons, surrounded by four servants,\r\narmed with bows and swords. Every driver had also a spear and an axe near\r\nhim, not counting forged hayforks and other cutting arms suitable upon\r\nthe road. Those arms were necessary for protection against wild beasts,\r\nas well as robbers, who always swarmed upon the border of the Knights of\r\nthe Cross. This caused Jagiello to complain in his letters to the Grand\r\nMaster of the Order, and when they met at Racionza.\r\n\r\nBut being provided with skilful men and good arms, the retinue traveled\r\nwithout fear.\r\n\r\nThe stormy day was succeeded by a wonderful one; cheerful, silent and so\r\nbright that the eyes of the travelers were blinded when not in the shade.\r\nNot a single leaf stirred; from each of them hung large drops of rain\r\nwhich the sun changed into a rainbow. Among the pine-needles they had the\r\nappearance of large glistening diamonds. The rainfall produced small\r\nstreams upon the road, which ran with glad sound toward the lower places,\r\nwhere they formed shallow little lakes. The whole neighborhood was wet\r\nand bedewed, but smiling in the morning brightness. On such mornings,\r\nalso, the human heart is filled with gladness. Therefore the ostlers and\r\nservants began to sing; they marveled at the silence which reigned among\r\nthose riding in front of them.\r\n\r\nBut they were quiet because a heavy burden oppressed Jagienka's heart.\r\nThere was something which had ended in her life, something broken.\r\nAlthough she was not experienced in meditation and could not determine\r\ndistinctly the cause and what was going on in her mind, yet she felt that\r\nall that had lived hitherto had vanished, that all her hopes had\r\ndissipated as the morning mist upon the fields is dissipated. She felt\r\nthat she must now renounce and give up everything and forget, and begin\r\nalmost a new life. She also thought that although, with God's will, her\r\npresent position was not of the worst, yet it could not be otherwise than\r\nsad, and in no way could the new life turn out to be as good as that\r\nwhich had just terminated. And an immense sorrow had taken hold of her\r\nheart, so that, at the thought that every past hope was gone forever,\r\ntears came to her eyes. But not wishing to add shame to her other\r\ntroubles, she restrained herself from weeping. She wished that she had\r\nnever left Zgorzelice; in that case she would not now have to return\r\nthither. Then, she thought, it was not only to remove the cause for\r\nattacks upon Zgorzelice by Cztan and Wilk that Macko brought her to\r\nSpychow. That she could not believe. \"No,\" she said, \"Macko also knew\r\nthat that was not the only cause for taking me away. Perhaps Zbyszko will\r\nalso know it.\" At that thought, her cheeks became crimson and bitterness\r\nfilled her heart.\r\n\r\n\"I was too daring,\" she said to herself, \"and now I have what I deserved.\r\nTrouble and uncertainty to-morrow, suffering and deep sorrow in the\r\nfuture and with it humiliation.\"\r\n\r\nBut the train of oppressing thoughts was interrupted by a man coming\r\nhastily from the opposite direction. The Bohemian, whose eyes nothing\r\nescaped, rushed toward the man, who with crossbow upon his shoulder and\r\nbadger-skin pouch at his side, and with a feather of a black woodcock in\r\nhis cap, was recognized as a forester.\r\n\r\n\"Hey! Who are you? Stop!\" exclaimed the Bohemian.\r\n\r\nThe man approached quickly, his face was agitated, and had the expression\r\nof those who have something extraordinary to communicate. He cried:\r\n\r\n\"There upon the road ahead of you is a man hanging on a tree!\"\r\n\r\nThe Bohemian was alarmed, thinking that it might be a murder, and he\r\nasked the man quickly:\r\n\r\n\"How far from here is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"A bowshot distance, and upon this road.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there nobody with him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nobody; I frightened away a wolf that was smelling around him.\"\r\n\r\nThe mention of a wolf quieted Hlawa, for it told him that there were\r\nneither people nor farms in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nThen Jagienka said:\r\n\r\n\"Look there, what is that?\"\r\n\r\nHlawa rushed ahead, and soon returned hurriedly.\r\n\r\n\"Zygfried is hanging there!\" he exclaimed while reining in his horse in\r\nfront of Jagienka.\r\n\r\n\"In the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost! You do not mean Zygfried,\r\nthe Knight of the Cross?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is he. He hung himself with the bridle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you say by himself?\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems so, because the saddle lies alongside him, and if there were\r\nrobbers they would have killed him outright and made off with the saddle,\r\nbecause it is valuable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall we proceed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us not go that way! No!\" cried Anula Sieciechowna, afraid.\r\n\"Something evil might happen to us!\"\r\n\r\nJagienka was also somewhat afraid, because she believed that the body of\r\na suicide is surrounded by crowds of evil spirits. But Hlawa, who was\r\nfearless and bold, said:\r\n\r\n\"Bah! I was near him, and even pushed him with the lance, and do not feel\r\nany devil upon my neck.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not blaspheme!\" cried Jagienka.\r\n\r\n\"I am not blaspheming,\" replied the Bohemian, \"I only trust in God's\r\npower. Nevertheless, if you are afraid we will go around it.\"\r\n\r\nSieciechowna begged him to do so; but Jagienka, having reflected for a\r\nmoment, said:\r\n\r\n\"It is not proper to leave the dead unburied. It is a Christian act\r\ncommanded by the Lord. Anyhow it is the body of a man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but it is the body of a Knight of the Cross, a hangman and\r\nexecutioner! Let the crows and wolves occupy themselves with his body.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was not specified. God will judge for his sins, but we must do our\r\nduty; and if we fulfil God's commandment nothing evil will befall us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, let it be done according to your wishes,\" replied the\r\nBohemian.\r\n\r\nAccordingly he gave the order to the servants, who were reluctant. But\r\nthey feared Hlawa, to oppose whom was a dangerous thing. Not having the\r\nnecessary spades to dig a hole in the ground, they therefore gathered\r\npitchforks and axes for that purpose and left. The Bohemian also went\r\nwith them and to give them an example, he crossed himself and cut with\r\nhis own hands the leather strap upon which the body was hanging.\r\n\r\nZygfried's face had become blue whilst hanging; he had an awful\r\nappearance, because his eyes were open and terror-stricken, his mouth was\r\nalso open as though in the act of trying to catch his last breath. They\r\nquickly dug a pit near by and pushed therein the corpse of Zygfried with\r\nthe handles of their pitchforks; they laid him with his face downward and\r\ncovered it first with dust, then they gathered stones and placed them\r\nupon it, because it was an immemorial custom to cover the graves of\r\nsuicides with stones; otherwise they would come out during the night and\r\nfrighten the passers-by.\r\n\r\nAs there were many stones upon the road and under the mosses, the grave\r\nwas soon covered with a considerable mound. Then Hlawa cut a cross with\r\nhis axe upon the trunk of the pine-tree near. He did that, not for\r\nZygfried, but to prevent evil spirits from gathering at that place. Then\r\nhe returned to the retinue.\r\n\r\n\"His soul is in hell and his body is already in the ground,\" he said to\r\nJagienka. \"We can travel now.\"\r\n\r\nThey started; but Jagienka, whilst passing along, took a small branch of\r\npine-tree and pressed it upon the stones. Then everybody of the train\r\nfollowed the example of the lady. That, too, had been an old custom.\r\n\r\nThey traveled for a long while absorbed in thought, thinking of that\r\nwicked monk and knight. Finally Jagienka said:\r\n\r\n\"God's justice cannot be escaped. It does not even permit the prayer,\r\n'Everlasting rest'[118] to be offered up because there is no mercy for\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have shown by your order to bury him that you possess a\r\ncompassionate soul,\" replied the Bohemian.\r\n\r\nThen he spoke hesitatingly: \"People talk. Bah! maybe they are not people,\r\nbut witches and wizards--that a halter or a strap taken from the hanging\r\nbody secures to the possessor certain luck in everything. But I did not\r\ntake the strap from Zygfried, because I wish that your luck should\r\nproceed from the Lord Jesus and not from necromancers.\"\r\n\r\nJagienka did not reply to that at once, but after awhile she sighed\r\nseveral times and said as it were to herself:\r\n\r\n\"Hey! My happiness is behind, not in front of me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the end of the ninth day after Jagienka's departure that\r\nZbyszko reached the frontier of Spychow, but Danusia was already so near\r\ndeath that he entirely lost all hope of bringing her alive to her father.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, when she began to be incoherent in her replies, he\r\nobserved that not only her mind was out of order, but that she was also\r\nsuffering from a certain malady against which that childlike frame,\r\nexhausted by so much suffering, prison, torture and continuous fright,\r\ncould not fight. Perhaps the noise of the fight of Macko and Zbyszko with\r\nthe Germans contributed to fill her cup of terror, and it was just about\r\nthat time that she was taken ill with that malady. Suffice it to say that\r\nthe fever never left her from that moment until they reached the end of\r\nthe journey. So far it was successfully accomplished, because throughout\r\nthe terrible wilderness, in the midst of great troubles, Zbyszko carried\r\nher as though she were dead. When they left the wilderness and reached\r\ninhabited regions, among farmers and nobles, trouble and danger ceased.\r\nWhen the people were informed that he carried one of their own daughters\r\nwhom he had rescued from the Knights of the Cross, especially when they\r\nknew that she was the daughter of the famous Jurand, of whose exploits\r\nthe minstrels sang in the villages, hamlets, and huts, they vied with\r\neach other in rendering help and service. They procured proper horses and\r\nsupplies. All doors stood open for them. It was no more necessary for\r\nZbyszko to carry her in a cradle when the strong young men carried her\r\nfrom one village to another in a litter. They carried her as carefully as\r\nthough she were a saint. The women surrounded her with the most tender\r\ncare. The men, upon hearing the account of her wrongs, gnashed their\r\nteeth, and not a few put on the steel cuirass, grasped the sword, axe, or\r\nlance and went along with Zbyszko, in order to take revenge with\r\ninterest. Because, the valiant race considered even retribution, wrong\r\nfor wrong, insufficient.\r\n\r\nBut revenge did not then occupy Zbyszko's mind; his only thought was for\r\nDanusia. He lived between flashes of hope when there were momentary signs\r\nof improvement, and gloomy despair when she got worse, and as far as her\r\nlatter condition was concerned, he could not deceive himself. A\r\nsuperstitious thought struck him more than once at the beginning of the\r\njourney, that there was, somewhere in the pathless regions they were\r\npassing, death, riding along with them, step by step, lying in wait for\r\nthe moment when he might fall upon Danusia and wring from her the last\r\nbreath of life. That vision or feeling became especially pronounced at\r\ndark midnight, so much so, that more than once he was seized with a\r\ndespairing desire to return and challenge death to a combat to a finish,\r\nin the same fashion as knights are wont to do toward each other. But at\r\nthe end of the journey it became worse, because he felt that death was\r\nnot following them, but was in the very midst of the retinue; invisible\r\ntruly, but so near that its cold breath could be felt. Then he understood\r\nthat against such an enemy, courage, strength and arms are counted as\r\nnothing and that he would be obliged to surrender the most precious head\r\nas a prey without even a struggle.\r\n\r\nAnd that was a most terrible feeling, because it roused within him a\r\ntempestuous, irresistible sorrow, a sorrow, bottomless as the sea. Could\r\ntherefore Zbyszko restrain himself from groaning, could his heart remain\r\nunbroken by pain, when he looked at his most beloved? He spoke to her as\r\nin terms of involuntary reproach: \"Was it for this that I loved you? Was\r\nit for this that I searched and rescued you in order that you should be\r\nput under ground to-morrow and I should never see you again?\" Then he\r\nwould look at her cheeks which glowed with fever, at her expressionless\r\nand dull eyes, and ask her again:\r\n\r\n\"Are you going to leave me? Are you not sorry for it? You prefer going to\r\nstaying with me.\" Then he thought that something was happening in his own\r\nhead, and his breast swelled with immense sadness which seared it, but he\r\ncould not give vent to his feeling with tears, because of a certain\r\nfeeling of anger and hatred against that compassionless power which was\r\nconsuming the innocent, blind, and cold child. If that wicked enemy, the\r\nKnight of the Cross, were present, he would have fallen upon him and torn\r\nhim to pieces like a wild beast.\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived at the forest court, he wished to halt, but as it was\r\nthe spring season the court was deserted. There he was informed by the\r\nkeepers that the princely pair had gone to their brother, Prince\r\nZiemowita, at Plock. He therefore resolved, instead of going to Warsaw\r\nwhere the court physician might have given her some relief, to go to\r\nSpychow. That plan was terrible, because it seemed to him that all was\r\nover with her and that he would not be able to bring her alive to Jurand.\r\n\r\nBut just as they were only a few hours distant from Spychow the brightest\r\nray of hope shone again in his heart. Danuska's cheeks became paler, her\r\neyes were less troubled, her breathing not so loud and quick. Zbyszko had\r\nobserved it immediately, and had given orders to stop, so that she might\r\nrest and breathe undisturbed.\r\n\r\nIt was only about three miles from the inhabited part of Spychow, upon a\r\nnarrow road winding between fields and meadows. They stopped near a wild\r\npear-tree whose branches served to the sick as a protection from the rays\r\nof the sun. The men dismounted and unbridled their horses so as to\r\nfacilitate their grazing. Two women, who were hired to attend Danusia and\r\nthe youths who carried her, fatigued with the road and heat, lay down in\r\nthe shade and slept. Only Zbyszko remained watching near the litter and\r\nsat close by upon the roots of the pear-tree, not taking his eyes off her\r\neven for a moment.\r\n\r\nShe lay in the midst of the afternoon silence, her eyelids closed. It\r\nseemed to Zbyszko that she was not asleep,--when at the other end of the\r\nmeadow a man who was mowing hay stopped and began to sharpen his scythe\r\nloudly upon the hone. Then she trembled a little and opened her eyelids\r\nfor a moment, but immediately closed them again. Her breast heaved as\r\nthough she was deeply inspiring, and in a hardly audible voice she\r\nwhispered:\r\n\r\n\"Flowers smell sweetly....\"\r\n\r\nThese were the first words, clear and free from fever, spoken since they\r\nhad left, because the breeze really wafted from the sun-warmed meadow a\r\nstrong, redolent hay and honey perfume, fragrant with the scent of herbs.\r\nThis caused Zbyszko to think that reason had returned to her. His heart\r\ntrembled within him for joy. He wished to throw himself at her feet at\r\nthe first impulse. But fearing lest that might frighten her, he desisted.\r\nHe only knelt in front of the litter, and bending over her, said in a\r\nwhisper:\r\n\r\n\"Dear Danusia! Danusia!\"\r\n\r\nShe opened her eyes again, and looked at him for a while. Then a smile\r\nbrightened up her face, the same as when she was in the tar-burner's\r\nshanty, but far from consciousness, but she pronounced his name:\r\n\r\n\"Zbyszko!...\"\r\n\r\nShe attempted to stretch her hands toward him, but owing to her great\r\nweakness she was unable to do it. But he embraced her, his heart was so\r\nfull that it seemed as if he were thanking her for some great favor he\r\nhad received.\r\n\r\n\"I praise the Lord,\" he said, \"you have awoke ... O God....\" Now his\r\nvoice failed him, and they looked at each other for some time in silence.\r\nThat silence was only interrupted by the gentle wind which moved the\r\nleaves of the pear-tree, the chirping of the grasshoppers among the grass\r\nand the distant indistinct song of the mower.\r\n\r\nIt seemed as though her consciousness was gradually increasing, for she\r\ncontinued to smile and had the appearance of a sleeping child seeing\r\nangels in its dream. Little by little her face assumed an air of\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! where am I?\" she cried. He was so much overcome with joy that he\r\nuttered numerous short and abrupt questions.\r\n\r\n\"Near Spychow. You are with me, and we are going to see dear papa. Your\r\nsorrow is ended. Oh! my darling Danusia, I searched for you and rescued\r\nyou. You are no more in the power of the Germans. Be not afraid. We shall\r\nsoon be at Spychow. You were ill, but the Lord Jesus had mercy upon you.\r\nThere was so much sorrow, so many tears! Dear Danusia. Now, everything is\r\nwell. There is nothing but happiness for you. Ah I how much did I search\r\nfor you!... How far did I wander!... Oh! Mighty God!... Oh!...\"\r\n\r\nHe sighed deeply and groaned as though he had thrown off the last heavy\r\nburden of suffering from his breast.\r\n\r\nDanusia lay quiet trying to recall something to her mind and reflecting\r\nupon something. Then finally she asked:\r\n\r\n\"So, you cared for me?\"\r\n\r\nTwo tears which were gathering in her eyes slowly rolled down her cheeks\r\nupon the pillow.\r\n\r\n\"I, not care for you?\" cried Zbyszko.\r\n\r\nThere was something more powerful in that smothered exclamation than in\r\nthe most vehement protestations and oaths, because he had always loved\r\nher with his whole soul. And from the moment when he had recovered her\r\nshe had become more dear to him than the whole world.\r\n\r\nSilence reigned again. The distant singing of the mowing peasant ceased\r\nand he began to whet his scythe again.\r\n\r\nDanusia's lips moved again, but with such a low whisper that Zbyszko\r\ncould not hear it. He therefore bent over her and asked:\r\n\r\n\"What do you say, darling?\"\r\n\r\nBut she repeated:\r\n\r\n\"Sweet smelling blossoms.\"\r\n\r\n\"Because we are near the meadows,\" he replied. \"But we shall soon proceed\r\nand go to dear papa, whom we have also rescued from captivity, and you\r\nshall be mine even unto death. Do you hear me well? Do you understand\r\nme?\"\r\n\r\nThen he suddenly became alarmed, for he observed that her face was\r\ngradually paling and was thickly covered with perspiration.\r\n\r\n\"What ails you?\" he asked in great alarm.\r\n\r\nAnd he felt his hair bristling and frost creeping through his bones.\r\n\r\n\"What ails you, tell me,\" he repeated.\r\n\r\n\"It darkens,\" she whispered.\r\n\r\n\"It darkens? Why, the sun shines and you say: 'it darkens'?\" he said with\r\na suppressed voice. \"Up to this time you have spoken rationally. In God's\r\nname I beseech you, speak, even if it is only one word.\"\r\n\r\nShe still moved her lips, but she was unable even to whisper. Zbyszko\r\nguessed that she tried to pronounce his name and that she called him.\r\nImmediately afterward, her emaciated hands began to twitch and flutter\r\nupon the rug covering her. That lasted only for a moment. No doubt was\r\nleft now that she had expired.\r\n\r\nHorrified and in despair, Zbyszko began to beg her, as though his\r\nentreaties could avail:\r\n\r\n\"Danuska! Oh, merciful Jesus!... Only wait till we come to Spychow! Wait!\r\nWait, I beseech you! Oh, Jesus! Jesus! Jesus!\"\r\n\r\nThe appeal awoke the sleeping women, and the men who were stretched with\r\nthe horses upon the lawn came running. They guessed at a glance what had\r\nhappened; they knelt down and began loudly to recite the litany.\r\n\r\nThe breeze ceased, even the leaves upon the pear-tree did not rustle.\r\nOnly the voices reciting the litany sounded throughout that profound\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nDanusia opened her eyes once more at the very end of the litany, as\r\nthough she wished to look upon Zbyszko and upon the sunlit world for the\r\nlast time. Then she lapsed into an everlasting sleep.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe women closed her eyelids; then they went to the meadow to gather\r\nflowers. The men followed them in file. Thus they walked in the sunshine\r\namong the luxuriant grass and had the appearance of field spirits bowing\r\nnow and then, and weeping, for their hearts were filled with pity and\r\nsorrow. Zbyszko was kneeling in the shade beside the litter, with his\r\nhead upon Danusia's knees, speechless and motionless, as if he too were\r\ndead. But the gatherers kept on plucking here and there, marigolds,\r\nbuttercups, bellflowers and plenty of red and white sweet-smelling little\r\nblossoms. They also found in the small moist hollows in the meadow,\r\nlilies of the valley, and upon the margin near the fallow ground, they\r\ngot St. John's wort until they had gathered their arms full. Then they\r\nsadly surrounded the litter and began to adorn it, until they had covered\r\nthe dead with flowers and herbs; they only left the face uncovered, which\r\nin the midst of the bellflowers and lilies looked white, peaceful, calm,\r\nas in eternal sleep, serene, and quite angelic.\r\n\r\nThe distance to Spychow was less than three miles. Then, when they had\r\nshed copious tears of sorrow and pain, they carried the litter toward the\r\nforest where Jurand's domains began.\r\n\r\nThe men led the horses in front of the retinue. Zbyszko himself carried\r\nthe litter upon his head, and the women loaded with the surplus of the\r\nbunches of flowers and herbs, sang hymns. They moved very slowly along\r\nthe herb-covered meadows and the grey fallow fields and had the\r\nappearance of a funeral procession. Not a cloudlet marred the blue clear\r\nsky, and the region warmed itself in the golden rays of the sun.\r\n\r\nThe further adventures of Zbyszko will be found in a subsequent volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The Benedictine Abbey at Tyniec was in Poland as important\r\nand rich, relatively, as the Abbey of Saint-Germain des Près in France.\r\nIn those times the order organized by Saint Benoit (Benedictus) was the\r\nmost important factor in the civilization and material prosperity of the\r\ncountry.
